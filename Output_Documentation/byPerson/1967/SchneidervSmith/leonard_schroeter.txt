mr.
leonard
schroeter
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
leonard
schroeter
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
as
a
consequence
of
an
order
of
this
court
which
postponed
further
consideration
of
the
question
of
probable
jurisdiction
to
a
hearing
of
the
case
in
the
merits.
under
this
court's
orders
and
its
rules
counsel
should
address
themselves
with
the
outside
--
outset
of
their
brief
and
oral
argument
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction.
this
is
in
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court,
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
2282.
the
complaint
of
the
appellant
asked
the
court
to
declaratory
an
injunctive
relief
when
constitutional
grounds
from
the
application
of
50
u.s.c.
191,
which
is
commonly
known
as
the
"magnuson
act".
it
was
alleged
that
the
act
was
unconstitutional
and
it
was
vague.
and
it
was
contended
below
that
there
was
unconstitutional
delegation
to
the
executive
of
legislative
power.
the
court
below
accepted
jurisdiction.
now
this
was
a
proper
case
for
the
invocation
of
the
three-judge
court
and
thus,
for
this
appeal.
the
government
concedes
in
their
brief
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
and
both
the
solicitor
general
and
the
appellant
state
that
these
questions
are
substantial
and
that
zemel
versus
rusk
is
authoritative
and
is
positive
of
this
question.
zemel
further
makes
it
clear
as
thus,
the
issue
that
jurisdiction
haven't
been
established.
this
court
will
consider
the
statutory
and
regulatory
schemes
as
a
whole.
now,
the
magnuson
act
under
which
this
case
arises
was
introduced
into
congress
in
july
of
1950,
less
than
one
month
after
the
korean
war
began.
now,
this
was
all
of
us
on
sure
recall,
a
time
of
great
anxiety
of
this
nation.
the
act
has
cast
the
house
of
representatives
with
no
debate
and
the
senate
with
virtually
none.
it
purported
to
a
man
the
world
war
i
statute
regulating
the
anchorage
and
movement
of
vessels
during
national
emergency
by
permitting
the
president
to
exercise
authority
other
than
by
the
proclamation
of
national
emergency
which
he
was
permitted
to
do.
and
secondly,
by
extending
the
authority
of
the
president
to:
ports,
harbors,
and
waterfront
facilities.
the
president
by
executive
order
shortly
thereafter
found
that
"the
security
of
the
united
states
is
endangered
by
reason
of
subversive
activity",
and
prescribed
regulations
that
delegated
his
authority
to
the
coast
guard.
a
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
by
such
regulations
required
that
as
a
precondition
of
maritime
employment.
the
maritime
workers
must
be
issued
a
specially
validated
emergency
endorsement.
no
person
shall
be
issued
such
a
document
which
is
required
for
an
employment
nor
may
he
be
employed
unless
"that
commandant
is
satisfied
that
the
character
and
habit
of
life
of
such
person
are
such
to
authorize
the
belief
that
his
employment
would
not
be
inimicable
to
the
security
of
the
united
states."
now
these
regulations
pursuant
to
the
executive
order,
where
the
genesis
of
what
we
know
as
the
maritime
security
screening
program.
this
program
is
the
only
government
to
one
private
employment
that
blankets
an
entire
industry.
it's
the
only
program
that
covers
private
employment
all
together
except
for
the
defense
contractor
security
program
where
the
employer,
is
of
course,
the
contractor
of
the
federal
government
dealing
with
classified
information.
although,
originally
proposed
as
an
emergency
measure
by
the
attorney
general
who
requested
that
the
authority
that
was
given
should
expire
on
a
specific
date.
by
1956,
well
over
800,000
men
have
been
screened
under
this
program
and
more
than
3,700
of
them
have
been
denied
employment
or
removed
from
employment.
the
program
is
wholly
administered
by
the
coast
guard
with
complete,
unchecked
discretion
in
a
commandant
of
the
coast
guard.
it
seeks
the
lead
out
subversives
form
among
all
maritime
workers,
who
presently
number
probably
in
excess
of
150,000.
and
that
includes
cooks
on
banana
boats,
checkers
on
the
docks,
sweepers
on
the
great
lakes,
the
rivers
of
--
the
navigable
rivers
of
this
country.
it
includes
people
doing
every
conceivable
kind
of
job
in
the
maritime
industry
in
vessel
above
100
ton
and
of
course
the
dock
workers.
the
way
the
program
works,
it
seems
to
me,
is
well
perceived
by
the
experiences
of
the
appellant
here.
by
the
information
it's
already
found
in
the
briefs
and
the
joined
appendix.
mr.
schneider
failed,
as
a
young
man,
during
the
1940s
and
was
a
qualified
--
and
qualified
as
a
marine
engineer.
when
his
children
arrived
he
quit
sailing.
in
1964
his
children
being
substantially
grown,
he
decided
to
go
back
to
the
sea
and
he
applied.
now
applying
meant
going
down
to
the
coast
guard
and
filling
out
certain
applications.
among
other
things,
those
applications
included
an
original
questionnaire
which
is
exhibit
a
2
in
the
joined
appendix
on
page
27.
and
the
original
questionnaire
asks
a
number
of
basic
questions
like,
have
you
been
arrested
for
or
convicted
of
the
offenses
of
treasons
and
sedition,
espionage
or
sabotaging?
he
denied
that
denied
also
that
he
have
ever
been
involved
in
the
conspiracy.
he
was
then
asked
whether
he
have
ever
been
involved
in
any
capacity
by
a
foreign
government
or
by
any
person
on
behalf
of
the
foreign
government.
he
answered
that,
"no".
last
night,
while
preparing
this
argument
for
this
court,
i
reread
this,
and
to
my
horror
even
though
this
is
off
of
the
record
but
i
think
it
notes
something.
i
realized
that
mr.
schneider
by
innocent
inadvertence
may
well
have
purged
himself
because
for
a
year,
he
and
his
wife
and
his
children
lived
in
a
cabot
in
israel.
now
for
the
wise
of
me,
i
don't
know
whether
the
answer
to
this
question
if
one
works
for
a
cabot's
in
israel
and
lives
in
a
cabot,
it's
really
yes
or
no.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
that's
question
number
3.
mr.
schneider
has
no
idea
i'm
making
these
concessions
on
his
behalf.
but
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
character
and
quality
of
these
questions
are
such
a
character
that
such
an
inadvertent
on
mr.
schneider's
part
such
a
lack
of
knowledge
put
indeed
have
occurred.
he
was
then
asked
whether
he
advocated
or
had
ever
advocated
the
overthrow
or
alteration
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
for
surveillance
or
by
unconstitutional
means
which
he
denied.
he
then
had
submitted
to
him
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
attorney
general's
list
and
which
is
listed
in
detail
in
this
particular
--
in
the
joined
appendix
commencing
on
page
27.
and
he
was
asked
whether
he
had
ever
submitted
material
for
publication
which
--
in
which
he
gave
a
negative
response.
and
whether
he
had
ever
been
a
member
of
or
affiliated
with
any
way
any
of
these
organizations.
now
as
the
record
subsequent
--
as
it
subsequently
appears
in
the
record
in
his
counsel
subsequently
pointed
out
by
way,
mr.
schneider
had
or
idealistic
reason
that
a
casual
member
of
the
communist
party
during
his
youth.
he
had
drifted
away
from
the
communist
party
in
the
late
1940s.
he
had
also
and
these
were
problems
that
he
faced
when
he
have
been
assessed
that
he'd
reading
this
list.
he
had
also
for
example
had
certain
contacts
because
he
was
interested
in
politics
with
some
problems
in
the
defense
of
a
well
known
west
coast
labor
leader,
in
which
he
left
unmentioned.
he
had
gone
to
a
labor
school
as
an
active
member
of
a
trade
union.
he
had
been
involved
in
democratic
politics
in
the
state
of
washington
which
during
given
periods
of
involved
some
relationships
with
some
of
the
organizations
listed
here.
he
found
it
extraordinarily
difficult
to
answer
these
questions
about
conduct
that
is
20
to
25
years
older.
he
found
the
questions
vague
and
uncertain.
he
did
not
know
what
to
do.
and
as
a
consequence,
he
answered
the
questions
in
the
fashion
set
forth
on
page
33
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
many
political
and
social
organizations
including
several
names
in
the
list.
he
couldn't
remember
the
names
of
most
of
it.
he
couldn't
specific
about
any
but
in
no
event
have
he
been
a
member
of
anything
for
some
substantial
period
of
time.
this
answer
of
course
was
given
under
pain
and
penalty
of
perjury.
and
it's
also
noted
on
page
33
of
the
joined
appendix,
it
appears
that
the
intelligence
division
of
the
coast
guard
received
this
questionnaire,
just
a
few
weeks
after
it
was
answered,
and
proceeded
to
check
it
by
using
the
facilities
of
the
fbi
and
the
other
government
investigated
bodies
that
are
available.
there
were
no
answers,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
schneider
went
to
the
coast
guard
and
said,
"what's
going
on?"
"why
am
i
not
receiving
my
special
validation?"
they
wrote
several
letters
to
which
there
was
no
response.
in
mid
march
he
retained
counsel.
and
the
counsel
then
by
virtual
of
a
number
of
letters
which
again
are
set
fort
commencing
on
page
17,
approached
the
coast
guard
by
mail
and
said
--
asked
what
was
happening
and
why
mr.
schneider
did
not
receive
the
special
validation.
the
coast
guard
responded
saying
that
he's
reluctant
to
furnish
names
and
dates
of
membership
had
delayed
their
investigation
now
some
five
months.
and
however,
they
anticipated
that
action
will
be
taken
in
the
near
future
which
presume
to
me
that
he
would
receive
his
special
validation.
nonetheless,
the
special
validation
was
not
received.
and
on
march
25th,
mr.
schneider
received
instead
a
group
of
interrogatories
from
the
government
when
she
was
also
compelled
to
answer
under
pain
and
penalty
of
perjury
are
those
interrogatory
being
contained
on
page
35
of
the
joined
appendix.
he
is
of
course
involved
asks
questions
to
such
as
listing
the
name
of
the
political
and
social
organizations
to
which
he
belong,
the
location,
the
dates
of
his
membership,
his
reasons
for
discontinuing
his
membership,
his
present
attitude
20
years
later
for
the
principles
and
objectives
of
such
an
organization.
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
now
or
had
ever
been
a
member
or
affiliated
in
any
way
with
the
communist
party?
whether
you'd
ever
subscribed
to
a
newspaper
the
people's
world?
whether
he
had
ever
engaged
in
any
activities
on
behalf
of
that
newspaper?
and
then
he
was
asked
to
write
an
essay
on
his
present
attitude
towards
the
communist
party,
and
the
rights
to
further
a
philosophical
essay,
and
his
present
attitude
towards
the
principles
and
objectives
of
communism,
and
towards
the
form
of
the
government
in
the
united
states.
these
sort
of
do
it
yourself
worthy
i
suppose.
in
any
event,
all
of
these
were
under
pain
and
penalty
of
perjury,
to
answer
these
questions
searching
his
mind.
well
at
this
point,
mr.
schneider
obviously
had
a
dilemma.
it
was
a
dilemma
of
his
or
it
was
a
dilemma
of
concerns.
mr.
schneider
wanted
to
shift
but
he
valued
his
constitutional
right.
counsel
didn't
wish
to
subject
if
the
hazards
of
self-incrimination
or
for
perjury
indictment.
so
mr.
schneider
faced
the
consequence
of
answering
the
questions
thus,
subjecting
himself
to
the
hazards
of
such
an
indictment
or
if
you
chose
not
to
answer
the
questions
the
hazard
of
never
been
able
to
proceed
in
its
chosen
occupation.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
that
third
course
the
so-called
administrative
channels
and
i'm
appreciative
of
the
facts
that
you
didn't
use
the
word
remedies.
the
administrative
channels
where
to
answer
the
questions.
that
is
the
only
administrative
channel
under
the
regulations
that
are
available.
and
indeed
when
the
district
court
of
this
circuit,
the
circuit
court
of
this
channel
in
graham
versus
richmond
had
earlier
said
that
a
person
need
not
answer
such
questions.
the
coast
guard
had
immediately
proceeded
to
create
additional
and
rather
difficult
channel
by
saying
that
anybody
who
did
not
answer
the
question
would
not
be
certified.
so
there
was
no
third
alternative,
sir.
except
to
against
his
conscience
answer
the
questions
with
the
hazards
implicit
in
that
or
alternatively
never
secure
employment.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
i
think
not.
i
don't
know
of
any
of
the
way
to
read
the
regulations.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
not
as
far
as
i
know
sir.
i
never
heard
such
an
argument
until
this
--
until
your
honor
suggested
that
it
might
exist.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
no,
i
think
not
sir.
in
any
event,
when
further
letters
were
to
no
avail
i
think
determined
to
bring
this
action.
now
all
of
this
is
in
face
of
the
fact
that
the
government
neither
contested
nor
produced
evidence
to
contradict
the
fact
that
mr.
schneider
has
always
been
and
is
loyal
to
the
united
states.
that
he
has
never
come
in
any
act
of
sabotage
or
espionage
or
any
act
inimical
to
the
security
of
the
united
states.
that
he
has
not
been
active
in
any
organization
on
the
attorney
general's
list
for
many
years.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
only
thing
one
can
safely
produced
from
this
failure
to
grant
him
special
certification
was
a
punitive
effort
on
the
part
of
the
coast
guard,
to
deprive
him
of
his
livelihood
because
it
is
an
assertion
of
his
constitutional
rights.
nothing
else
can
be
perceived
in
the
record
or
from
the
behavior
or
the
exchange
of
correspondents.
now
the
issue
post
here,
the
central
issue
post
is
that
expressed
by
this
court
in
by
question,
whether
the
right
to
employment
can
be
conditioned
upon
the
surrender
of
the
constitutional
rights
which
could
not
be
a
bridge
by
directing
government
action.
the
court
of
course,
this
court
sites
many
cases
and
answers
the
question
negatively.
yet,
this
has
been
and
remains
the
central
contention
of
the
government
has
been
right
from
the
beginning.
they
justify
their
contention
that
the
question
should
be
answered
affirmatively.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
it
gives
me
great
comfort.
i
even
contemplated
standing
up
and
saying,
robel
and
sitting
down.
it
seems
to
me
if
decisive
of
this
case
and
i
was
about
to
add
that
i
thought
that
robel
certainly
went
directly
to
that
point
and
answered
it
besides
the
claim
and
i
hope
to
find
it.
but
in
addition
to
that
of
course,
the
government
trying
to
answer
the
other
way
makes
two
points.
and
there
are
only
two
that
i
never
been
able
to
locate
in
their
briefs
and
arguments.
first,
they
make
the
argument
of
what
i
would
be
called
a
missed
describe
exhaustion
of
remedy
argument.
and
secondly,
they
appealed
with
the
necessities
of
national
defense
just
as
the
court's
decision
in
robel
yesterday.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
remedy
unless
i
misunderstood
your
question,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
it's
the
key
argument
but
i
had
understood
your
question
to
me
whether
he
could
exhaust
his
remedies
other
than
by
answering
the
question
interrogatory.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
yes.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
precisely.
the
government
--
the
analogy
in
the
sense
to
the
criminal
procedure,
the
government
takes
the
position,
it
seems
to
me
like
the
prosecutor
might
to
the
criminal
first
in
charge
with
the
crime.
you
can
have
your
trial
if
you
submit
to
incarceration
and
persistent
questioning
without
the
presence
of
the
counsel.
then
you're
entitled
for
a
trial.
this
is
what
the
government
says.
it
says,
"violate
your
constitutional
rights
by
answering
all
these
interrogatories
placing
yourself
on
these
hazardous
positions
and
violating
your
conscientious
position
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment.
and
then,
we
will
rule
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
be
especially
validated?
now,
i
suggest
sir
that
that's
not
administrative
remedy.
that's
a
submission
it
to
a
government
in
position.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
robel
answered
both
the
question
as
we
post
earlier
and
the
appeal
to
the
necessities
of
national
defense
when
this
court
said,
that
such
an
appeal
unrelated
to
our
basic
constitutional
principles
cannot
be
used
as
a
justification
for
their
destruction.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
we
always
hoped
that
our
enemy
will
write
a
book
and
that
--
and
lawyers
i
suppose
are
always
distressed
when
they
see
letters
that
they
wrote
for
a
few
days
after
a
client
came
in
the
office.
i
think
they
were
hazards
and
very
real
ones.
they
were
not
the
kinds
of
absolute
impediments
that
contained,
of
course,
in
the
criminal
statute
involved
in
robel.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
what
i
was
seeking
to
say
inartistically
and
rather
badly
was
that
it
is
so
obvious
that
this
man
cannot
constitute
a
security
risk
to
anybody
and
that
he
is
obviously
such
an
upstanding,
honest,
decent
guy
that
even
the
coast
guard
has
got
to
understand
this.
this
is
what
i
was
really
saying.
but
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
and
i
believe
your
honor
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
warned
that
one
cannot
always
rely
upon
what
the
prosecutor
might
do.
and
i
was
simultaneously
worried,
after
all
the
robel
indictment
occurred
in
seattle.
and
the
crime
in
seattle
is
not
always
everything
we
would
want
it
to
be
and
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
leonard
schroeter
i
think
that's
true,
right.
but
i
wanted
to
both
be
safe
and
yet
--really,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
to
the
coast
guard
is,
"look
for
heaven's
sake,
don't
make
this
man
go
through
the
answering
of
these
questions
that
were
obnoxious."
i
don't
put
him
in
a
position
of
jeopardy.
it
is
planned.
all
you
have
to
do,
as
i
laid
a
point
out
in
one
of
the
letters
of
--
the
most
minimal
investigation
of
herbert
schneider.
would
it
reveal
that
--
that
this
man
was
a
clearly
good
--
a
man
of
good
first
amendment
character.
but
the
horror
of
the
situation
of
course,
this
shouldn't
be
put
through
in
the
first
instance
and
the
problem
of
counsel
is
that
mr.
schneider
wanted
to
go
to
see.
and
at
the
same
time,
he
wanted
to
protect
rights
that
he
got
with
pressures
and
that
his
principle
of
it.
this
was
the
dilemma.
and
really
the
basic
principles
opposed
by
this
case
it
seems
to
me,
a
very
fundamental
kind
of
principle.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
post
in
this
case
the
whole
concept
of
the
privacy
of
the
individual.
this
would
be
claim
of
government
necessity
which
is
really
what
the
bill
of
rights
i
taken
it
all
about.
and
an
implicit
in
this,
there
are
notions
of
the
non-acceptance
of
assumptions
or
presumptions
or
inferences
of
guilt
based
upon
people's
beliefs
and
association.
we
were
in
this
in
the
long
terms
of
concepts
and
presumption
of
innocence
and
burdens
of
proof.
and
the
recognition
that
i
hope
and
believe
that
courts
have
that
people
had
the
capacity
for
a
change.
implicit
in
this
is
the
non-assumption
that
individuals
are
tainted
by
the
allegedly
bad
character
of
their
associational
relationships.
the
assertion
it
seems
to
me
of
vital
--
of
the
vital
public
necessity,
not
just
schneider's
necessity.
but
the
public's
necessity
that
individuals
be
non-intimidated
in
areas
of
beliefs,
thoughts,
speech,
and
association.
really,
so
the
democratic
political
process
can
work,
the
assertion
of
the
essential
of
the
human
personality,
the
right
of
privacy
in
a
sense
which
includes
the
right
to
remain
silent
laws
to
speak,
the
right
to
be
free
of
the
indignity
of
inquisitorial
kinds
of
inquiries.
also
it
seems
implicit
in
this
case,
is
the
necessity
and
the
maintenance
for
freedom
of
a
rule
of
law.
now,
what
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
in
his
form
of
capacity
of
dean
of
my
law
school,
had
to
say
in
a
very
good
book
called
the
fifth
amendment,
where
he
referred
to
the
second
chapter,
"to
the
law
of
the
land"
this
whole
concept
of
due
process
that
underlies
these.
the
notion
that
we
cannot
maintain
our
democracy
,
if
we're
outside
the
laws
the
justice
of
this
court
in
his
former
capacity
of
the
distinguished
constitutional
lawyer.
i
pointed
out
an
article
by
that
name
in
the
atlantic
monthly
in
august
1953.
an
article
which
could
be
read
profitably
today
because
it
describes
mr.
justice
fortas'
article
outside
the
law
describes
the
very
rights.
that
is
inherent
in
the
maritime
screen
program.
so
at
the
minimum
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
the
right
to
expect
from
our
government,
my
government,
your
government
that
it
will
take
no
steps
to
compel
a
man
to
place
himself
in
jeopardy.
that
no
one
may
be
subjected
to
the
possibility
of
the
punishment
by
laws
of
employment
unless
probable
cause
is
first
found
for
an
assertion
of
disloyalty
or
lack
of
security.
so
that
he
should
be
confronted
in
detail
and
with
specificity
as
to
any
charges
against
him.
they
be
permitted
to
confront
his
accuser
that
he
be
afforded
that
opportunity
for
consulate
cross
examine
such
accuse
him.
and
to
present
evidence
in
his
behalf
that
he
be
judged
only
by
what's
on
the
record
and
by
evidence
which
he
has
the
opportunity
to
meet
that
his
accuser
his
judge,
his
jury
not
be
the
same
or
responsible
with
the
same
law
with
authority,
and
that
the
process
provides
an
independent
judicial
review.
none
of
these
things
are
present
in
the
coast
guard
regulations
as
they
exist.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
leonard
schroeter
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
as
a
consequence
of
an
order
of
this
court
which
postponed
further
consideration
of
the
question
of
probable
jurisdiction
to
a
hearing
of
the
case
in
the
merits.
under
this
court's
orders
and
its
rules
counsel
should
address
themselves
with
the
outside
--
outset
of
their
brief
and
oral
argument
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction.
this
is
in
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court,
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
2282.
the
complaint
of
the
appellant
asked
the
court
to
declaratory
an
injunctive
relief
when
constitutional
grounds
from
the
application
of
50
u.s.c.
191,
which
is
commonly
known
as
the
"magnuson
act".
it
was
alleged
that
the
act
was
unconstitutional
and
it
was
vague.
and
it
was
contended
below
that
there
was
unconstitutional
delegation
to
the
executive
of
legislative
power.
the
court
below
accepted
jurisdiction.
now
this
was
a
proper
case
for
the
invocation
of
the
three-judge
court
and
thus,
for
this
appeal.
the
government
concedes
in
their
brief
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
and
both
the
solicitor
general
and
the
appellant
state
that
these
questions
are
substantial
and
that
zemel
versus
rusk
is
authoritative
and
is
positive
of
this
question.
zemel
further
makes
it
clear
as
thus,
the
issue
that
jurisdiction
haven't
been
established.
this
court
will
consider
the
statutory
and
regulatory
schemes
as
a
whole.
now,
the
magnuson
act
under
which
this
case
arises
was
introduced
into
congress
in
july
of
1950,
less
than
one
month
after
the
korean
war
began.
now,
this
was
all
of
us
on
sure
recall,
a
time
of
great
anxiety
of
this
nation.
the
act
has
cast
the
house
of
representatives
with
no
debate
and
the
senate
with
virtually
none.
it
purported
to
a
man
the
world
war
i
statute
regulating
the
anchorage
and
movement
of
vessels
during
national
emergency
by
permitting
the
president
to
exercise
authority
other
than
by
the
proclamation
of
national
emergency
which
he
was
permitted
to
do.
and
secondly,
by
extending
the
authority
of
the
president
to:
ports,
harbors,
and
waterfront
facilities.
the
president
by
executive
order
shortly
thereafter
found
that
"the
security
of
the
united
states
is
endangered
by
reason
of
subversive
activity",
and
prescribed
regulations
that
delegated
his
authority
to
the
coast
guard.
a
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
by
such
regulations
required
that
as
a
precondition
of
maritime
employment.
the
maritime
workers
must
be
issued
a
specially
validated
emergency
endorsement.
no
person
shall
be
issued
such
a
document
which
is
required
for
an
employment
nor
may
he
be
employed
unless
"that
commandant
is
satisfied
that
the
character
and
habit
of
life
of
such
person
are
such
to
authorize
the
belief
that
his
employment
would
not
be
inimicable
to
the
security
of
the
united
states."
now
these
regulations
pursuant
to
the
executive
order,
where
the
genesis
of
what
we
know
as
the
maritime
security
screening
program.
this
program
is
the
only
government
to
one
private
employment
that
blankets
an
entire
industry.
it's
the
only
program
that
covers
private
employment
all
together
except
for
the
defense
contractor
security
program
where
the
employer,
is
of
course,
the
contractor
of
the
federal
government
dealing
with
classified
information.
although,
originally
proposed
as
an
emergency
measure
by
the
attorney
general
who
requested
that
the
authority
that
was
given
should
expire
on
a
specific
date.
by
1956,
well
over
800,000
men
have
been
screened
under
this
program
and
more
than
3,700
of
them
have
been
denied
employment
or
removed
from
employment.
the
program
is
wholly
administered
by
the
coast
guard
with
complete,
unchecked
discretion
in
a
commandant
of
the
coast
guard.
it
seeks
the
lead
out
subversives
form
among
all
maritime
workers,
who
presently
number
probably
in
excess
of
150,000.
and
that
includes
cooks
on
banana
boats,
checkers
on
the
docks,
sweepers
on
the
great
lakes,
the
rivers
of
--
the
navigable
rivers
of
this
country.
it
includes
people
doing
every
conceivable
kind
of
job
in
the
maritime
industry
in
vessel
above
100
ton
and
of
course
the
dock
workers.
the
way
the
program
works,
it
seems
to
me,
is
well
perceived
by
the
experiences
of
the
appellant
here.
by
the
information
it's
already
found
in
the
briefs
and
the
joined
appendix.
mr.
schneider
failed,
as
a
young
man,
during
the
1940s
and
was
a
qualified
--
and
qualified
as
a
marine
engineer.
when
his
children
arrived
he
quit
sailing.
in
1964
his
children
being
substantially
grown,
he
decided
to
go
back
to
the
sea
and
he
applied.
now
applying
meant
going
down
to
the
coast
guard
and
filling
out
certain
applications.
among
other
things,
those
applications
included
an
original
questionnaire
which
is
exhibit
a
2
in
the
joined
appendix
on
page
27.
and
the
original
questionnaire
asks
a
number
of
basic
questions
like,
have
you
been
arrested
for
or
convicted
of
the
offenses
of
treasons
and
sedition,
espionage
or
sabotaging?
he
denied
that
denied
also
that
he
have
ever
been
involved
in
the
conspiracy.
he
was
then
asked
whether
he
have
ever
been
involved
in
any
capacity
by
a
foreign
government
or
by
any
person
on
behalf
of
the
foreign
government.
he
answered
that,
"no".
last
night,
while
preparing
this
argument
for
this
court,
i
reread
this,
and
to
my
horror
even
though
this
is
off
of
the
record
but
i
think
it
notes
something.
i
realized
that
mr.
schneider
by
innocent
inadvertence
may
well
have
purged
himself
because
for
a
year,
he
and
his
wife
and
his
children
lived
in
a
cabot
in
israel.
now
for
the
wise
of
me,
i
don't
know
whether
the
answer
to
this
question
if
one
works
for
a
cabot's
in
israel
and
lives
in
a
cabot,
it's
really
yes
or
no.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
that's
question
number
3.
mr.
schneider
has
no
idea
i'm
making
these
concessions
on
his
behalf.
but
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
character
and
quality
of
these
questions
are
such
a
character
that
such
an
inadvertent
on
mr.
schneider's
part
such
a
lack
of
knowledge
put
indeed
have
occurred.
he
was
then
asked
whether
he
advocated
or
had
ever
advocated
the
overthrow
or
alteration
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
for
surveillance
or
by
unconstitutional
means
which
he
denied.
he
then
had
submitted
to
him
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
attorney
general's
list
and
which
is
listed
in
detail
in
this
particular
--
in
the
joined
appendix
commencing
on
page
27.
and
he
was
asked
whether
he
had
ever
submitted
material
for
publication
which
--
in
which
he
gave
a
negative
response.
and
whether
he
had
ever
been
a
member
of
or
affiliated
with
any
way
any
of
these
organizations.
now
as
the
record
subsequent
--
as
it
subsequently
appears
in
the
record
in
his
counsel
subsequently
pointed
out
by
way,
mr.
schneider
had
or
idealistic
reason
that
a
casual
member
of
the
communist
party
during
his
youth.
he
had
drifted
away
from
the
communist
party
in
the
late
1940s.
he
had
also
and
these
were
problems
that
he
faced
when
he
have
been
assessed
that
he'd
reading
this
list.
he
had
also
for
example
had
certain
contacts
because
he
was
interested
in
politics
with
some
problems
in
the
defense
of
a
well
known
west
coast
labor
leader,
in
which
he
left
unmentioned.
he
had
gone
to
a
labor
school
as
an
active
member
of
a
trade
union.
he
had
been
involved
in
democratic
politics
in
the
state
of
washington
which
during
given
periods
of
involved
some
relationships
with
some
of
the
organizations
listed
here.
he
found
it
extraordinarily
difficult
to
answer
these
questions
about
conduct
that
is
20
to
25
years
older.
he
found
the
questions
vague
and
uncertain.
he
did
not
know
what
to
do.
and
as
a
consequence,
he
answered
the
questions
in
the
fashion
set
forth
on
page
33
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
many
political
and
social
organizations
including
several
names
in
the
list.
he
couldn't
remember
the
names
of
most
of
it.
he
couldn't
specific
about
any
but
in
no
event
have
he
been
a
member
of
anything
for
some
substantial
period
of
time.
this
answer
of
course
was
given
under
pain
and
penalty
of
perjury.
and
it's
also
noted
on
page
33
of
the
joined
appendix,
it
appears
that
the
intelligence
division
of
the
coast
guard
received
this
questionnaire,
just
a
few
weeks
after
it
was
answered,
and
proceeded
to
check
it
by
using
the
facilities
of
the
fbi
and
the
other
government
investigated
bodies
that
are
available.
there
were
no
answers,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
schneider
went
to
the
coast
guard
and
said,
"what's
going
on?"
"why
am
i
not
receiving
my
special
validation?"
they
wrote
several
letters
to
which
there
was
no
response.
in
mid
march
he
retained
counsel.
and
the
counsel
then
by
virtual
of
a
number
of
letters
which
again
are
set
fort
commencing
on
page
17,
approached
the
coast
guard
by
mail
and
said
--
asked
what
was
happening
and
why
mr.
schneider
did
not
receive
the
special
validation.
the
coast
guard
responded
saying
that
he's
reluctant
to
furnish
names
and
dates
of
membership
had
delayed
their
investigation
now
some
five
months.
and
however,
they
anticipated
that
action
will
be
taken
in
the
near
future
which
presume
to
me
that
he
would
receive
his
special
validation.
nonetheless,
the
special
validation
was
not
received.
and
on
march
25th,
mr.
schneider
received
instead
a
group
of
interrogatories
from
the
government
when
she
was
also
compelled
to
answer
under
pain
and
penalty

questions

as

social

to

he
belong,
the

the

his

he
was
asked
whether
he
was

had
ever

affiliated
in
any

with

whether

whether

these
sort
of
do
it
yourself
worthy
i
suppose.
in
any
event,
all
of
these
were
under
pain
and
penalty
of
perjury,
to
answer
these
questions
searching
his
mind.
well
at
this
point,
mr.
schneider
obviously
had
a
dilemma.
it
was
a
dilemma
of
his
or
it
was
a
dilemma
of
concerns.
mr.
schneider
wanted
to
shift
but
he
valued
his
constitutional
right.
counsel
didn't
wish
to
subject
if
the
hazards
of
self-incrimination
or
for
perjury
indictment.
so
mr.
schneider
faced
the
consequence
of
answering
the
questions
thus,
subjecting
himself
to
the
hazards
of
such
an
indictment
or
if
you
chose
not
to
answer
the
questions
the
hazard
of
never
been
able
to
proceed
in
its
chosen
occupation.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
that
third
course
the
so-called
administrative
channels
and
i'm
appreciative
of
the
facts
that
you
didn't
use
the
word
remedies.
the
administrative
channels
where
to
answer
the
questions.
that
is
the
only
administrative
channel
under
the
regulations
that
are
available.
and
indeed
when
the
district
court
of
this
circuit,
the
circuit
court
of
this
channel
in
graham
versus
richmond
had
earlier
said
that
a
person
need
not
answer
such
questions.
the
coast
guard
had
immediately
proceeded
to
create
additional
and
rather
difficult
channel
by
saying
that
anybody
who
did
not
answer
the
question
would
not
be
certified.
so
there
was
no
third
alternative,
sir.
except
to
against
his
conscience
answer
the
questions
with
the
hazards
implicit
in
that
or
alternatively
never
secure
employment.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
i
think
not.
i
don't
know
of
any
of
the
way
to
read
the
regulations.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
not
as
far
as
i
know
sir.
i
never
heard
such
an
argument
until
this
--
until
your
honor
suggested
that
it
might
exist.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
no,
i
think
not
sir.
in
any
event,
when
further
letters
were
to
no
avail
i
think
determined
to
bring
this
action.
now
all
of
this
is
in
face
of
the
fact
that
the
government
neither
contested
nor
produced
evidence
to
contradict
the
fact
that
mr.
schneider
has
always
been
and
is
loyal
to
the
united
states.
that
he
has
never
come
in
any
act
of
sabotage
or
espionage
or
any
act
inimical
to
the
security
of
the
united
states.
that
he
has
not
been
active
in
any
organization
on
the
attorney
general's
list
for
many
years.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
only
thing
one
can
safely
produced
from
this
failure
to
grant
him
special
certification
was
a
punitive
effort
on
the
part
of
the
coast
guard,
to
deprive
him
of
his
livelihood
because
it
is
an
assertion
of
his
constitutional
rights.
nothing
else
can
be
perceived
in
the
record
or
from
the
behavior
or
the
exchange
of
correspondents.
now
the
issue
post
here,
the
central
issue
post
is
that
expressed
by
this
court
in
by
question,
whether
the
right
to
employment
can
be
conditioned
upon
the
surrender
of
the
constitutional
rights
which
could
not
be
a
bridge
by
directing
government
action.
the
court
of
course,
this
court
sites
many
cases
and
answers
the
question
negatively.
yet,
this
has
been
and
remains
the
central
contention
of
the
government
has
been
right
from
the
beginning.
they
justify
their
contention
that
the
question
should
be
answered
affirmatively.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
it
gives
me
great
comfort.
i
even
contemplated
standing
up
and
saying,
robel
and
sitting
down.
it
seems
to
me
if
decisive
of
this
case
and
i
was
about
to
add
that
i
thought
that
robel
certainly
went
directly
to
that
point
and
answered
it
besides
the
claim
and
i
hope
to
find
it.
but
in
addition
to
that
of
course,
the
government
trying
to
answer
the
other
way
makes
two
points.
and
there
are
only
two
that
i
never
been
able
to
locate
in
their
briefs
and
arguments.
first,
they
make
the
argument
of
what
i
would
be
called
a
missed
describe
exhaustion
of
remedy
argument.
and
secondly,
they
appealed
with
the
necessities
of
national
defense
just
as
the
court's
decision
in
robel
yesterday.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
remedy
unless
i
misunderstood
your
question,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
it's
the
key
argument
but
i
had
understood
your
question
to
me
whether
he
could
exhaust
his
remedies
other
than
by
answering
the
question
interrogatory.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
yes.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
precisely.
the
government
--
the
analogy
in
the
sense
to
the
criminal
procedure,
the
government
takes
the
position,
it
seems
to
me
like
the
prosecutor
might
to
the
criminal
first
in
charge
with
the
crime.
you
can
have
your
trial
if
you
submit
to
incarceration
and
persistent
questioning
without
the
presence
of
the
counsel.
then
you're
entitled
for
a
trial.
this
is
what
the
government
says.
it
says,
"violate
your
constitutional
rights
by
answering
all
these
interrogatories
placing
yourself
on
these
hazardous
positions
and
violating
your
conscientious
position
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment.
and
then,
we
will
rule
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
be
especially
validated?
now,
i
suggest
sir
that
that's
not
administrative
remedy.
that's
a
submission
it
to
a
government
in
position.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
robel
answered
both
the
question
as
we
post
earlier
and
the
appeal
to
the
necessities
of
national
defense
when
this
court
said,
that
such
an
appeal
unrelated
to
our
basic
constitutional
principles
cannot
be
used
as
a
justification
for
their
destruction.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
we
always
hoped
that
our
enemy
will
write
a
book
and
that
--
and
lawyers
i
suppose
are
always
distressed
when
they
see
letters
that
they
wrote
for
a
few
days
after
a
client
came
in
the
office.
i
think
they
were
hazards
and
very
real
ones.
they
were
not
the
kinds
of
absolute
impediments
that
contained,
of
course,
in
the
criminal
statute
involved
in
robel.
mr.
leonard
schroeter
what
i
was
seeking
to
say
inartistically
and
rather
badly
was
that
it
is
so
obvious
that
this
man
cannot
constitute
a
security
risk
to
anybody
and
that
he
is
obviously
such
an
upstanding,
honest,
decent
guy
that
even
the
coast
guard
has
got
to
understand
this.
this
is
what
i
was
really
saying.
but
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
and
i
believe
your
honor
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
warned
that
one
cannot
always
rely
upon
what
the
prosecutor
might
do.
and
i
was
simultaneously
worried,
after
all
the
robel
indictment
occurred
in
seattle.
and
the
crime
in
seattle
is
not
always
everything
we
would
want
it
to
be
and
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
leonard
schroeter
i
think
that's
true,
right.
but
i
wanted
to
both
be
safe
and
yet
--really,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
to
the
coast
guard
is,
"look
for
heaven's
sake,
don't
make
this
man
go
through
the
answering
of
these
questions
that
were
obnoxious."
i
don't
put
him
in
a
position
of
jeopardy.
it
is
planned.
all
you
have
to
do,
as
i
laid
a
point
out
in
one
of
the
letters
of
--
the
most
minimal
investigation
of
herbert
schneider.
would
it
reveal
that
--
that
this
man
was
a
clearly
good
--
a
man
of
good
first
amendment
character.
but
the
horror
of
the
situation
of
course,
this
shouldn't
be
put
through
in
the
first
instance
and
the
problem
of
counsel
is
that
mr.
schneider
wanted
to
go
to
see.
and
at
the
same
time,
he
wanted
to
protect
rights
that
he
got
with
pressures
and
that
his
principle
of
it.
this
was
the
dilemma.
and
really
the
basic
principles
opposed
by
this
case
it
seems
to
me,
a
very
fundamental
kind
of
principle.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
post
in
this
case
the
whole
concept
of
the
privacy
of
the
individual.
this
would
be
claim
of
government
necessity
which
is
really
what
the
bill
of
rights
i
taken
it
all
about.
and
an
implicit
in
this,
there
are
notions
of
the
non-acceptance
of
assumptions
or
presumptions
or
inferences
of
guilt
based
upon
people's
beliefs
and
association.
we
were
in
this
in
the
long
terms
of
concepts
and
presumption
of
innocence
and
burdens
of
proof.
and
the
recognition
that
i
hope
and
believe
that
courts
have
that
people
had
the
capacity
for
a
change.
implicit
in
this
is
the
non-assumption
that
individuals
are
tainted
by
the
allegedly
bad
character
of
their
associational
relationships.
the
assertion
it
seems
to
me
of
vital
--
of
the
vital
public
necessity,
not
just
schneider's
necessity.
but
the
public's
necessity
that
individuals
be
non-intimidated
in
areas
of
beliefs,
thoughts,
speech,
and
association.
really,
so
the
democratic
political
process
can
work,
the
assertion
of
the
essential
of
the
human
personality,
the
right
of
privacy
in
a
sense
which
includes
the
right
to
remain
silent
laws
to
speak,
the
right
to
be
free
of
the
indignity
of
inquisitorial
kinds
of
inquiries.
also
it
seems
implicit
in
this
case,
is
the
necessity
and
the
maintenance
for
freedom
of
a
rule
of
law.
now,
what
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
in
his
form
of
capacity
of
dean
of
my
law
school,
had
to
say
in
a
very
good
book
called
the
fifth
amendment,
where
he
referred
to
the
second
chapter,
"to
the
law
of
the
land"
this
whole
concept
of
due
process
that
underlies
these.
the
notion
that
we
cannot
maintain
our
democracy
,
if
we're
outside
the
laws
the
justice
of
this
court
in
his
former
capacity
of
the
distinguished
constitutional
lawyer.
i
pointed
out
an
article
by
that
name
in
the
atlantic
monthly
in
august
1953.
an
article
which
could
be
read
profitably
today
because
it
describes
mr.
justice
fortas'
article
outside
the
law
describes
the
very
rights.
that
is
inherent
in
the
maritime
screen
program.
so
at
the
minimum
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
the
right
to
expect
from
our
government,
my
government,
your
government
that
it
will
take
no
steps
to
compel
a
man
to
place
himself
in
jeopardy.
that
no
one
may
be
subjected
to
the
possibility
of
the
punishment
by
laws
of
employment
unless
probable
cause
is
first
found
for
an
assertion
of
disloyalty
or
lack
of
security.
so
that
he
should
be
confronted
in
detail
and
with
specificity
as
to
any
charges
against
him.
they
be
permitted
to
confront
his
accuser
that
he
be
afforded
that
opportunity
for
consulate
cross
examine
such
accuse
him.
and
to
present
evidence
in
his
behalf
that
he
be
judged
only
by
what's
on
the
record
and
by
evidence
which
he
has
the
opportunity
to
meet
that
his
accuser
his
judge,
his
jury
not
be
the
same
or
responsible
with
the
same
law
with
authority,
and
that
the
process
provides
an
independent
judicial
review.
none
of
these
things
are
present
in
the
coast
guard
regulations
as
they
exist.
thank
you.
