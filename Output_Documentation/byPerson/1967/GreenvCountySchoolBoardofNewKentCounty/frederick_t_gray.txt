mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
few
years
ago
there
was
a
very
popular
parlor
game
called
gossip.
and
the
game
was
played
by
a
person
writing
down
a
little
statement
on
a
piece
of
paper
not
letting
anyone
see
what
he
had
written
and
then
whispering
it
to
the
person
on
his
left
and
letting
it
proceed
to
be
whispered
one
person
to
another
around
the
room,
until
it
finally
was
whispered
back
to
the
person
who
had
uttered
it,
and
he
would
then
state
aloud
what
had
been
whispered
to
him
and
read
aloud
what
he
had
originally
said.
and
the
point
of
the
game
was
that
the
results
were
usually
very
amusing
and
sometimes
quite
startling
that
the
change
that
had
come
to
be
in
what
was
said
originally
and
what
got
back
to
him
because
the
message
gets
groveled
in
the
transmission.
over
13
years
now
since
this
court
decided
the
brown
cases.
the
cases
have
been
talked
about,
construed
and
interpreted
in
the
courts
of
this
land.
and
i
think
that
we
can
very
quickly
point
out
some
of
th
results
and
similarities
to
the
game
of
gossip
by
reference
to
portions
of
the
brief.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
they
attempt,
your
honor,
i
would
suppose
to
be
that
everyone
would
try
to
repeat
as
accurately
as
possible.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think,
your
honor
that
the
courts
of
this
land
have
tried
as
accurately
as
they
can
to
repeat
what
this
court
has
said,
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
any
of
the
courts
have
tried
to
distort
the
brown
decisions.
your
honor,
i
would
recall
in
the
oral
arguments
--
in
the
course
of
the
oral
arguments
in
the
brown
case,
mr.
justice
frankfort
at
one
point
in
questioning
counsel
asked
whether
or
not
he
did
not
think
that
in
a
decision
of
this
magnitude,
the
court
should
not
fashion
its
language
with
fastidious
accuracy
with
his
direct
quote.
and
i
think
that
your
honor,
in
light
of
these
opinions,
chose
language
very
carefully
because
of
the
significance
and
importance
of
it.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
we
have
to
the
brown
decisions
themselves
to
determine
what
this
court
meant
when
it
wrote
about
brown
decisions.
if
i
may
point
out
to
the
language
on
page
30
and
31
of
the
appellant's
briefs,
in
speaking
of
brown
ii,
appellants
say
that
this
court
presuppose
major
reorganization
of
the
educational
systems.
and
the
that
the
direction
of
brown
ii
said
that
the
lower
courts
were
held
to
consider
problems
relating
to
admission
arising
our
of
physical
condition
of
school
plans,
the
school
transportation
system,
personnel
revisions,
revision
of
school
lines,
attendance
areas
and
so
forth.
but
this
your
honor
was
not,
as
i
understand,
by
an
announced,
it
has
been
understood.
this
was
not
a
direction
to
the
district
court
that
all
of
these
things
of
necessity
need
be
revised.
this
was
said
in
response
to
the
request
that
time
needed
to
be
granted,
and
your
honor
said
that
the
district
courts
in
determining
with
what
speed
the
district
court
must
require
the
school
systems
to
move
could
take
these
problems
into
consideration.
that
these
things
might
have
to
be
done
in
order
to
achieve
the
results,
but
there
was
no
direction
that
all
of
this
be
done.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
in
this
county?
if
your
honor
please
in
this
county
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
immediately
following
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
in
new
kent
county
immediately
following
the
brown
decisions.
the
state
of
virginia
undertook
all
pupil
assignment
function
the
state
pupil
placement
board
had
this
pupil
assignment
function.
the
county
school
board
had
no
control
whatsoever
over
student
assignments.
when
the
state
pupil
assignment
board
was
abolished
and
new
kent
county,
virginia
again
had
the
pupil
assignment
function.
this
was
the
first
time
that
new
kent
county,
virginia
had
the
assignment
function
after
the
constitutional
provision
in
virginia
requiring
the
segregation
of
the
races
was
struck
down.
the
first
action
which
new
kent
count,
virginia
school
board
ever
took
after
brown
was
to
adopt
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
that
every
child
in
the
county
could
go
to
the
school
of
his
choice.
that
is
the
first
act
that
these
defendants
ever
took.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
your
honor
'64,
i
believe
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
'64.
now
going
forward
with
this
quotation
or
this
reference
in
the
brief,
if
your
honor
please
and
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
here
is
that
what
we
have
before
us
is
what
you
have
to
decide
today
is,
does
brown
compel
integration.
that
runs
--
if
that's
what
runs
through
these
three
cases.
and
at
page
31
of
their
brief,
the
appellants
here
attribute
to
this
court
as
i
read
what
they
are
saying
in
the
middle
paragraph
of
that
page.
they
say
that
the
court
did
not
stop
saying
that
compulsory
racial
assignment
shall
seize,
here's
a
direct
quote
from
their
brief
now,
but
the
court
did
not
stop
there.
it
ordered
rather
a
pervasively
organization
which
would
transform
the
system
into
one
that
was
“unitary
and
non-racial”.
now
as
i
read
this,
this
purports
to
be
a
direct
quotation
from
brown
and
i
can
not
find
it
in
brown,
i
find
it
in
jefferson
only
recently
decided.
now,
this
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
case.
i
can
not
conceive
your
honors
that
brown
ordered
compulsory
integration.
mr.
tucker
has
referred
here
this
morning
to
the
fact
that
in
briggs
against
elliot
which
was
one
of
the
five
cases
before
this
court,
brown
--
the
time
of
the
brown
decisions.
45
days
after
the
decision,
judge
parker
on
the
fourth
district
bench
handed
down
the
decision
that
what
the
court
has
done
is
strike
down
compulsory
segregation,
but
it
has
not
ordered
compulsory
integration.
and
it
is
inconceivable
to
me,
call
it
dicta
if
you
like,
in
its
original
utterance
perhaps
it
was,
but
it
didn't
remain
dicta
very
long.
it
has
been
adopted
by
one
court
after
another
across
this
land.
and
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
it
could
stand
in
the
repeated
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
and
stand
as
a
guide
for
the
courts
of
this
land
if
that
were
not
the
meaning
of
brown
when
it
was
given.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think,
your
honor,
until
the
jefferson
case
it
has
been
generally
very
uniformly
accepted,
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
jefferson
county.
it's
the
first
case
which
departed
from
the
conception
that
compulsory
integration
is
not
required.
i
think
your
honors
in
preparation
for
this
matter
attempting
to
determine
what
brown
meant,
we
have
reread
the
arguments
made
before
this
court
and
the
briefs
filed
before
this
court.
and
i
sincerely
say
to
this
court
that
if
you
were
to
reread
those
voluminous
arguments
and
the
briefs
filed
there,
you
would
quickly
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
weren't
even
asked.
that
question
wasn't
even
here.
mr.
justice
marshall
was
--
distinguished
counsel
in
the
case
for
the
petitioner
from
plaintiffs
there,
and
i
have
two
--
on
two
occasions
on
december
9
in
the
briggs
case
on
one
--
at
one
point
he
said
“my
emphasis
is
that
all
we
are
asking
for
is
to
take
off
the
state
imposed
segregation.
it
is
the
state
imposed
part
of
it
that
affects
the
individual
children.”
and
on
another
point,
we
are
not
asking
affirmative.
striking
down
the
statute
will
not
put
anybody
in
any
school.
the
only
thing
we
ask
for
is
that
the
state
impose
racial
segregation
be
taken
off
and
leave
to
the
county
school
board,
the
county
people,
the
district
people
to
work
out
their
own
solution
to
the
problems
to
assign
children
on
any
reasonable
basis
that
they
want
to
assign
them
on.
so
we
urge
your
honors
that
in
deciding
this
question,
the
issue
that
are
here
that
you
return
to
brown.
your
honor,
in
determining
the
validity
of
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
requiring
segregation
both
in
the
states
and
in
the
district
of
columbia
be
laid
these
provision
down
alongside
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
case
of
the
states
and
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
case
of
the
district
to
see
if
they
squared
with
the
constitution.
and
we
say
that
must
go
back
to
the
constitution
and
lay
down
freedom
of
choice
alongside
the
equal
protection
clause
and
read
the
equal
protection
clause.
no
state
shall
deny
any
person
within
his
jurisdiction
equal
protection
of
the
law.
now
that's
the
tip
and
that
is
what
we
ask
for.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
for
three
years
before
'65
sir,
the
pupil
placement
board,
the
state
pupil
placement
board
accorded
any
child
assignment
to
the
school
that
he
chose.
now
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
county
did
not
have
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
sir,
but
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
first
time
that
this
county
had
the
authority
after
the
brown
decision
to
assign
children
to
school
was
'65.
for
the
year
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
children
had
the
right
prior
to
'65
to
apply
to
the
state
pupil
placement
board
which
controlled
the
assignment
of
all
children.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
and
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
say
it's
for
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
say
it
for
that
the
pupil
placement
plan
of
1965
accords
to
every
child
in
new
kent
county,
virginia.
the
right
to
go
to
any
school
in
the
county
regardless
of
his
race
and
accords
to
him
full
equal
protection
of
the
law,
but
if
i
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
it
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
it
was
to
give
children
freedom
of
choice
to
attend
whichever
school
they
want.
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
oh,
on
question
if
it
was
brought
about
by
the
brown
decision,
yes
sir,
because
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
race
had
to
be
involved
in
adoption
of
it,
sir
prior
to
the
brown
decision,
the
constitution
of
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
constitution
of
the
state
prohibited
the
mixing
of
the
races.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
justice
marshall,
let
me
ask
you
in
this
manner
if
i
may,
as
i
can
see
the
situation
in
new
kent
county
as
related
to
brown.
prior
to
the
brown
decision
with
two
schools,
one
in
each
end
of
the
county
in
new
kent
county,
there
was
a
fence.
there
was
a
legal
fence
across
that
county
and
the
law
of
the
state
of
virginia
said
to
the
white
children
“you
go
to
school
a
and
you
may
not
climb
that
fence
and
go
to
school
b.”
and
it
said
to
the
colored
children
in
the
county
“you
go
to
school
b
and
you
may
not
climb
the
fence
and
go
school
a.”
and
this
court
sir,
said
to
the
county
“take
down
that
fence.”
and
it
was
taken
down
by
the
brown
decision,
and
the
school
board
said
to
the
children
and
says
to
the
children
“there
are
two
schools
in
this
county.
look
them
over
regardless
of
whether
you
are
white
or
colored,
look
them
over
and
go
to
the
one
that
you
choose.”
and
the
appellants
here
today
are
saying
to
this
court
“choices
are
not
being
made
that
suit
us.
put
the
fence
back.”
build
a
fence
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
today
and
say
to
certain
of
the
white
children,
“no
you
may
not
go
to
school
a
because
all
white
children
can't
congregate
there
and
because
some
of
you
are
white
you
must
go
to
school
b.”
and
to
say
to
the
colored
children,
“no
you
may
not
all
go
to
school
b,
you
must
go
to
school
a,
because
we
can't
have
you
congregating
in
school
b.”
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
going
full
circle,
the
case
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
but
for
what
reason
your
honor?
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
your
honor
that
is
the
vehicle
which
would
be
used.
that
is
the
device
which
would
be
used
to
do
it,
but
for
what
reason?
it's
just
inconceivable
to
me
that
i
stand
before
this
court,
the
highest
court
in
this
land
this
morning,
defending
the
school
board
of
new
kent
county.
and
at
this
very
moment
in
new
kent
county
we're
denying
somebody
something.
we're
denying
equal
protection
of
the
law.
that's
what
they
say.
i
don't
--
they
went
to
the
decisions
doesn't
bother
me.
are
we
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
that's
what
we
have
to
square
with
and
at
this
very
moment
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
every
child
in
the
county
just
happens
by
coincidence
the
choice
period
is
open
right
now.
from
now
till
the
first
of
may
and
every
child
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
has
one
of
these
choices.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes.
no
white
child
have
applied
to
go
to
colored
school.
no,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
sir.
not
unless
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
free
choice
of
an
american
citizen
is
a
booby-traps
and
this
plan
has
booby-traps.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
deliberate
speed
to
what
your
honor?
deliberate
speed
to
the
granting
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
not
to
the
integration
of
a
school
system.
not
to
the
integration
of
a
school
system.
i
ask
you
sir,
who
is
the
plaintiff
in
those
lawsuits?
i
think
you
get
to
the
question
there.
who
is
the
plaintiff?
who
can
stand
before
the
bar
of
this
court
and
say
to
this
court
“i
am
being
denied
my
equal
rights
when
i
can
--“
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
but
sir,
by
signing
this
piece
of
paper,
you
may
go
to
either
school
that
the
county
offers.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no.
if
your
honor
please,
over
three
years
of
operation
of
this
plan,
first
year
35
white
children
chose
to
go
--
colored
children
chose
to
go
to
the
--
your
honor
asked
me
a
question
about
the
indians
let
me
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
let
me
parenthetically
explain
that
situation.
there
had
been
for
years
indian
tribes
who
lived
on
reservations
in
new
kent
and
charles
city
county,
virginia.
they
wanted
their
own
school
system
and
they
had
their
own
school
system
until
the
adoption
of
the
freedom
of
choice
plan
being
modeled
on
the
guidelines
of
hew
which
say
that
you
may
not
transport
children
out
of
the
a
county
or
into
a
county
to
preserve
any
form
of
racial
segregation.
and
for
that
reason
we
had
to
take
away
from
the
indians
the
schools
that
they
would
have
preferred
to
keep,
but
they
chose
the
school
to
which
they
went
just
like
every
other
child
in
the
county.
but
your
honor,
it's
just
inconceivable
that
anyone
could
stand
here
and
say
to
this
court
“i'm
being
denied
equal
protection”
because
as
your
honor
said
in
brown
i
“public
education,
when
the
state
undertakes
to
provide,
must
be
given
to
all
on
the
equal
terms.”
now,
i
say
to
your
honor
that
any
child
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
can
get
any
educational
facility
which
new
kent
county
offers
by
the
mere
signing
of
his
name.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
sir.
that
would
not
be
freedom
of
choice.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
in
this
case
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
the
case
before
this
court
in
the
fourth
circuit,
there
was
an
admission
before
the
bar
of
the
court,
judge
hanesworth
took
into
consideration
the
very
pipe
of
factors
that
you
are
mentioning.
and
he
said
“of
course,
if
there
were
any
extraneous
pressures
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
free
choice.”
but
there
is
an
admission
before
the
bar
of
the
court
in
this
case
that
the
choices
are
free
and
unrestricted.
and
in
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
sir?
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
that
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
68
of
the
appendix,
it's
in
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
in
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
at
page
22.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
in
the
appendix
sir
at
page
68
is
judge
hanesworth's
statement.
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
appellants
at
page
22
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
white
brief
at
page
22,
they
say,
“to
be
sure
each
child
was
given
the
unrestricted
right
to
attend
any
school
in
the
system.”
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
they
are
quoting
there,
if
your
honor
please,
from
the
guidelines
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
stating
of
this
situation
across
the
country
general.
but
in
this
case
which
was
presented
to
a
court
of
law,
counsel
for
the
appellant
admitted
that
the
children
have
a
free
and
un-incumbent
choice.
if
we're
not
--
we're
talking
about
free
choice
plans
and
that's
something
else,
but
what
we
would
talk
about
is
where
they
do
have
a
free
choice.
and
in
this
county,
115
children
of
the
colored
race
have
elected
to
go
to
the
white
schools.
they
are
going
to
the
white
schools.
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
offered
by
anyone
that
anyone
of
them
has
been
in
any
way
abused,
that
any
parent
has
lost
his
job,
that
any
pressure
has
been
exerted
and
the
school
board
in
notifying
the
parents
of
their
plan
tell
them
that
they
will
be
admitted
to
the
school
of
their
choice
to
all
of
its
activities
that
there
will
be
no
coercion,
no
punishment
nothing
of
any
kind
to
use
against
them.
so
it
just
isn't
in
this
case
to
say
that
there
are
pressures.
in
new
kent
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i'm
sorry
that
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
any
reason
why
the
plan
--
why
one
plan
was
chosen
over
another?
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there
is
nothing
to
show
why
they
chose
the
freedom
of
choice
plan.
no,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
115
negroes
attending
new
kent
school,
yes
sir.
and
of
course
your
honor,
as
i
said,
the
freedom
of
choice
period
is
open
at
this
moment.
we
don't
know
what
choices
will
be
made
for
this
coming
school
year.
your
honor
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
sir.
there
is
not.
there
--
now
if
i
may
answer
to
as
to
this
115
children
specifically,
no,
sir.
the
record
does
show
in
answer
to
interrogatories
and
in
the
utterance
which
was
developed
that
generally
the
pattern
of
residences
is
throughout
the
county.
there's
no
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there's
--
i
do
not
know
sir
and
the
record
does
not
show.
i
do
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there're
busses
to
take
the
children
to
both
schools.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
would
be
transported
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
sir.
the
busses
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
the
busses
serve
the
schools,
if
you
go
to
the
school
that
this
bus
is
going
to
you
ride
that
bus.
there's
no
--
there's
no
segregation
on
the
busses.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
watkins
area
if
that
is
the
choice
that
they
make,
yes
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
sir
what
the
court
would
say,
but
i
know
what
hew
would
say,
because
they
very
specifically
and
of
course
in
the
adoption
of
the
plan,
we
also
adopt
this
provision.
they
are
so
fearful
of
the
subtle
pressure
that
mr.
justice
marshall
is
speaking
about
that
they
would
never
permit
you
to
question
why
he
was
--
why
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
your
honor,
but
i
can
say
to
you
why
they
were
made.
they
were
made
because
in
a
role
of
virginia
county
the
colored
school
is
the
community
center
of
colored
activity.
it's
the
hub
of
their
social.
they
don't
want
to
loose
that
school.
this
is
the
heart
of
their
social
life
and
their
community
center.
they
--
they
go
to
that
school
because
they
want
to
go
there.
in
my
home
city,
my
home
of
hoopla,
we
want
to
--
thought
was
given
to
consolidating
the
high
school
into
one
high
school
that
was
--
they
were
based
on
residential
patterns.
it
was
a
colored
high
school
which
was
on
one
side
of
the
town,
the
white
high
school
on
the
other.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
the
white
child
parent
certainly
can
not
choose
to
go
to
a
segregated
school,
because
he
does
not
go
to
segregated
school.
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
if,
your
honor,
if
we
were
going
to
--
the
only
way
you
could
do
that
is
to
say
that
no
one
but
white
will
go
here
and
this
isn't
the
case.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
it
would
be
for
people
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
it
would
be
permissible
under
this
plan,
and
i
think
it
would
be
permissible
on
the
constitution.
your
honor
if
i
may
answer
you
in
this
way,
i
have
time
to
make
this
answer.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
it
seems
to
me
that
prior
to
brown,
the
government
of
my
state
and
the
government
of
many
states
for
reasons
sufficient
to
the
government
determined
that
it's
better
for
one
reason
or
another,
it's
better
that
white
children
go
to
one
school
and
colored
children
go
to
another
school.
this
court
struck
that
down
and
said,
“you
may
not
have
compulsory
segregation.”
and
when
it
was
stricken
down,
this
county
at
least
said,
“all
right,
i'll
answer
to
that.
just
let
every
child
go
where
he
wants
to
go.
we
deny
no
one
anything.
and
now,
people
stand
before
this
court
and
say
to
you
the
right
choices
aren't
being
made
and
the
only
reason
that
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
parent,
guardian
or
if
the
child
had
reached
the
ninth
grade
or
is
15
years
old
he
may
make
his
own
choice.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
either
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
i
think
you
would
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
plan
was
conceived
sir
by
school
board
which
had
the
duty,
a
sworn
duty
to
try
to
preserve
public
education
and
to
better
public
education
in
new
kent
county.
they
had
before
them,
certainly
in
law
at
least,
some
alternatives.
i
presume
they
could
have,
if
they
chose,
put
the
name
of
every
first
grade
child
in
a
paper
bag
and
say,
“all
right,
we'll
do
it
by
lottery.
we'll
pull
out
and
this
child
will
go
to
this
school
and
this
child
will
go
to
this
school
regardless.”
they
could
have
done
it
by
pairing
the
schools,
one
as
an
elementary
school
one
as
a
high
school,
but
as
long
as
they
did
in
a
manner
that
did
not
deny
in
any
child
the
equal
protection
of
the
law,
they
did
constitutionally.
they
chose
the
plan
which
they
felt
would
preserve
the
public
education
system
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
for
all
of
the
children
and
to
give
them
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
and
i
say
to
you
sir
that
there
is
not
a
child
in
new
kent
who
can
stand
before
this
court
and
say
that,
“the
school
board
of
new
kent
county
is
denying
me
anything.”
every
facility
is
open
to
him,
and
i
say
to
you
if
it
is
an
education,
an
integrated
education
if
that's
what
the
colored
plaintiff
wants
i
can
provide
it
for
him
this
morning
if
he's
in
the
courtroom.
he
need
only
to
sign
that
form
and
check
the
new
kent
school
and
he
will
have
a
fully
integrated
education.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
your
honor
that
i
can't.
new
kent
county
and
charles
city
county
were
adjoining
counties
both
of
them
have
a
colored
population
larger
than
the
white
population.
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
and
i
think
that
the
appellant
very
wisely
chose
not
to
proceed
with
the
charles
city
appeal
which
they
started
to
bring
here.
charles
city
county
has
progress
a
bit
to
follow
along
the
line.
in
charles
city
county
a
great
many
of
the
elected
officials
are
members
of
the
colored
race.
in
new
kent
county
of
the
governing
body,
there
are
four
men
on
the
governing
body.
one
of
the
members
of
the
governing
body
is
a
negro.
in
charles
city
county,
one
of
the
members
of
the
school
board
who
adopted
an
identical
freedom
of
choice
plan
is
a
negro
and
who
felt
that
if
we
afford
everyone
a
free
opportunity
to
go
everybody
wants
to
go,
we
do
not
deny
them
equal
protection.
i
do
not
believe
sir
that
there
is
any
community
activity.
the
race
relations
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
are
excellent.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
that
in
generally
speaking
sir
that
is
true.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
i
can
always
say
to
you
sir,
as
i
have
said
before
that
this
record
in
this
lawsuit
recites
in
the
court's
opinion
and
in
the
brief
filed
here
they
admitted
in
the
bar
of
the
court
they
have
free
and
unrestricted
choice.
and
if
you
want
to
send
us
back
on
evidentiary
hearing
as
to
whether
they
are
community
pressure
is
militating
against
their
choice,
that's
another
thing.
but
this
case
this
case
on
this
record
has
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
that
they
do
have
an
unrestricted
choice.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
about
what's
happened
in
that
county
for
a
hundred
years
before
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
i
think
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
i
think
that
is
in
your
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
that
it
did
that
into
consideration.
certainly,
it
was
entitled
to
it,
it
was
a
matter
of
law
up
until
the
brown
decision
that
it
was
constitutionally
permissible
to
have
separate
facilities,
and
this
court
had
put
its
stamp
of
approval
of
it.
so
i
think
that
what
you
should
do
is
look
at
what
has
happened
under
this
plan.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
to
see
if
this
plan
is
working
fairly.
look
at
what
has
happened
under
this
plan.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
as
i
understand
brown
its
purpose
was
to
strike
down
compulsory
segregation.
that
has
been
totally
and
completely
accomplished.
if
it
is
your
purpose
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
compulsory
integration
does
not
exist
in
new
kent
county,
virginia.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
few
years
ago
there
was
a
very
popular
parlor
game
called
gossip.
and
the
game
was
played
by
a
person
writing
down
a
little
statement
on
a
piece
of
paper
not
letting
anyone
see
what
he
had
written
and
then
whispering
it
to
the
person
on
his
left
and
letting
it
proceed
to
be
whispered
one
person
to
another
around
the
room,
until
it
finally
was
whispered
back
to
the
person
who
had
uttered
it,
and
he
would
then
state
aloud
what
had
been
whispered
to
him
and
read
aloud
what
he
had
originally
said.
and
the
point
of
the
game
was
that
the
results
were
usually
very
amusing
and
sometimes
quite
startling
that
the
change
that
had
come
to
be
in
what
was
said
originally
and
what
got
back
to
him
because
the
message
gets
groveled
in
the
transmission.
over
13
years
now
since
this
court
decided
the
brown
cases.
the
cases
have
been
talked
about,
construed
and
interpreted
in
the
courts
of
this
land.
and
i
think
that
we
can
very
quickly
point
out
some
of
th
results
and
similarities
to
the
game
of
gossip
by
reference
to
portions
of
the
brief.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
they
attempt,
your
honor,
i
would
suppose
to
be
that
everyone
would
try
to
repeat
as
accurately
as
possible.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think,
your
honor
that
the
courts
of
this
land
have
tried
as
accurately
as
they
can
to
repeat
what
this
court
has
said,
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
any
of
the
courts
have
tried
to
distort
the
brown
decisions.
your
honor,
i
would
recall
in
the
oral
arguments
--
in
the
course
of
the
oral
arguments
in
the
brown
case,
mr.
justice
frankfort
at
one
point
in
questioning
counsel
asked
whether
or
not
he
did
not
think
that
in
a
decision
of
this
magnitude,
the
court
should
not
fashion
its
language
with
fastidious
accuracy
with
his
direct
quote.
and
i
think
that
your
honor,
in
light
of
these
opinions,
chose
language
very
carefully
because
of
the
significance
and
importance
of
it.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
we
have
to
the
brown
decisions
themselves
to
determine
what
this
court
meant
when
it
wrote
about
brown
decisions.
if
i
may
point
out
to
the
language
on
page
30
and
31
of
the
appellant's
briefs,
in
speaking
of
brown
ii,
appellants
say
that
this
court
presuppose
major
reorganization
of
the
educational
systems.
and
the
that
the
direction
of
brown
ii
said
that
the
lower
courts
were
held
to
consider
problems
relating
to
admission
arising
our
of
physical
condition
of
school
plans,
the
school
transportation
system,
personnel
revisions,
revision
of
school
lines,
attendance
areas
and
so
forth.
but
this
your
honor
was
not,
as
i
understand,
by
an
announced,
it
has
been
understood.
this
was
not
a
direction
to
the
district
court
that
all
of
these
things
of
necessity
need
be
revised.
this
was
said
in
response
to
the
request
that
time
needed
to
be
granted,
and
your
honor
said
that
the
district
courts
in
determining
with
what
speed
the
district
court
must
require
the
school
systems
to
move
could
take
these
problems
into
consideration.
that
these
things
might
have
to
be
done
in
order
to
achieve
the
results,
but
there
was
no
direction
that
all
of
this
be
done.
mr.
frederick
t.

in
this
county?
if
your
honor
please
in

had
no
control
whatsoever
over
student
assignments.
when
the
state
pupil
assignment
board
was
abolished
and
new
kent
county,
virginia
again
had
the
pupil
assignment
function.
this
was
the
first
time
that
new
kent
county,
virginia
had
the
assignment
function
after
the
constitutional
provision
in
virginia
requiring
the
segregation
of
the
races
was
struck
down.
the
first
action
which
new
kent
count,
virginia
school
board
ever
took
after
brown
was
to
adopt
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
that
every
child
in
the
county
could
go
to
the
school
of
his
choice.
that
is
the
first
act
that
these
defendants
ever
took.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
your
honor
'64,
i
believe
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
'64.
now
going
forward
with
this
quotation
or
this
reference
in
the
brief,
if
your
honor
please
and
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
here
is
that
what
we
have
before
us
is
what
you
have
to
decide
today
is,
does
brown
compel
integration.
that
runs
--
if
that's
what
runs
through
these
three
cases.
and
at
page
31
of
their
brief,
the
appellants
here
attribute
to
this
court
as
i
read
what
they
are
saying
in
the
middle
paragraph
of
that
page.
they
say
that
the
court
did
not
stop
saying
that
compulsory
racial
assignment
shall
seize,
here's
a
direct
quote
from
their
brief
now,
but
the
court
did
not
stop
there.
it
ordered
rather
a
pervasively
organization
which
would
transform
the
system
into
one
that
was
“unitary
and
non-racial”.
now
as
i
read
this,
this
purports
to
be
a
direct
quotation
from
brown
and
i
can
not
find
it
in
brown,
i
find
it
in
jefferson
only
recently
decided.
now,
this
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
case.
i
can
not
conceive
your
honors
that
brown
ordered
compulsory
integration.
mr.
tucker
has
referred
here
this
morning
to
the
fact
that
in
briggs
against
elliot
which
was
one
of
the
five
cases
before
this
court,
brown
--
the
time
of
the
brown
decisions.
45
days
after
the
decision,
judge
parker
on
the
fourth
district
bench
handed
down
the
decision
that
what
the
court
has
done
is
strike
down
compulsory
segregation,
but
it
has
not
ordered
compulsory
integration.
and
it
is
inconceivable
to
me,
call
it
dicta
if
you
like,
in
its
original
utterance
perhaps
it
was,
but
it
didn't
remain
dicta
very
long.
it
has
been
adopted
by
one
court
after
another
across
this
land.
and
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
it
could
stand
in
the
repeated
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
and
stand
as
a
guide
for
the
courts
of
this
land
if
that
were
not
the
meaning
of
brown
when
it
was
given.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think,
your
honor,
until
the
jefferson
case
it
has
been
generally
very
uniformly
accepted,
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
jefferson
county.
it's
the
first
case
which
departed
from
the
conception
that
compulsory
integration
is
not
required.
i
think
your
honors
in
preparation
for
this
matter
attempting
to
determine
what
brown
meant,
we
have
reread
the
arguments
made
before
this
court
and
the
briefs
filed
before
this
court.
and
i
sincerely
say
to
this
court
that
if
you
were
to
reread
those
voluminous
arguments
and
the
briefs
filed
there,
you
would
quickly
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
weren't
even
asked.
that
question
wasn't
even
here.
mr.
justice
marshall
was
--
distinguished
counsel
in
the
case
for
the
petitioner
from
plaintiffs
there,
and
i
have
two
--
on
two
occasions
on
december
9
in
the
briggs
case
on
one
--
at
one
point
he
said
“my
emphasis
is
that
all
we
are
asking
for
is
to
take
off
the
state
imposed
segregation.
it
is
the
state
imposed
part
of
it
that
affects
the
individual
children.”
and
on
another
point,
we
are
not
asking
affirmative.
striking
down
the
statute
will
not
put
anybody
in
any
school.
the
only
thing
we
ask
for
is
that
the
state
impose
racial
segregation
be
taken
off
and
leave
to
the
county
school
board,
the
county
people,
the
district
people
to
work
out
their
own
solution
to
the
problems
to
assign
children
on
any
reasonable
basis
that
they
want
to
assign
them
on.
so
we
urge
your
honors
that
in
deciding
this
question,
the
issue
that
are
here
that
you
return
to
brown.
your
honor,
in
determining
the
validity
of
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
requiring
segregation
both
in
the
states
and
in
the
district
of
columbia
be
laid
these
provision
down
alongside
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
case
of
the
states
and
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
case
of
the
district
to
see
if
they
squared
with
the
constitution.
and
we
say
that
must
go
back
to
the
constitution
and
lay
down
freedom
of
choice
alongside
the
equal
protection
clause
and
read
the
equal
protection
clause.
no
state
shall
deny
any
person
within
his
jurisdiction
equal
protection
of
the
law.
now
that's
the
tip
and
that
is
what
we
ask
for.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
for
three
years
before
'65
sir,
the
pupil
placement
board,
the
state
pupil
placement
board
accorded
any
child
assignment
to
the
school
that
he
chose.
now
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
county
did
not
have
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
sir,
but
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
first
time
that
this
county
had
the
authority
after
the
brown
decision
to
assign
children
to
school
was
'65.
for
the
year
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
children
had
the
right
prior
to
'65
to
apply
to
the
state
pupil
placement
board
which
controlled
the
assignment
of
all
children.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
and
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
say
it's
for
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
say
it
for
that
the
pupil
placement
plan
of
1965
accords
to
every
child
in
new
kent
county,
virginia.
the
right
to
go
to
any
school
in
the
county
regardless
of
his
race
and
accords
to
him
full
equal
protection
of
the
law,
but
if
i
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
it
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
it
was
to
give
children
freedom
of
choice
to
attend
whichever
school
they
want.
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
oh,
on
question
if
it
was
brought
about
by
the
brown
decision,
yes
sir,
because
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
race
had
to
be
involved
in
adoption
of
it,
sir
prior
to
the
brown
decision,
the
constitution
of
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
constitution
of
the
state
prohibited
the
mixing
of
the
races.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
justice
marshall,
let
me
ask
you
in
this
manner
if
i
may,
as
i
can
see
the
situation
in
new
kent
county
as
related
to
brown.
prior
to
the
brown
decision
with
two
schools,
one
in
each
end
of
the
county
in
new
kent
county,
there
was
a
fence.
there
was
a
legal
fence
across
that
county
and
the
law
of
the
state
of
virginia
said
to
the
white
children
“you
go
to
school
a
and
you
may
not
climb
that
fence
and
go
to
school
b.”
and
it
said
to
the
colored
children
in
the
county
“you
go
to
school
b
and
you
may
not
climb
the
fence
and
go
school
a.”
and
this
court
sir,
said
to
the
county
“take
down
that
fence.”
and
it
was
taken
down
by
the
brown
decision,
and
the
school
board
said
to
the
children
and
says
to
the
children
“there
are
two
schools
in
this
county.
look
them
over
regardless
of
whether
you
are
white
or
colored,
look
them
over
and
go
to
the
one
that
you
choose.”
and
the
appellants
here
today
are
saying
to
this
court
“choices
are
not
being
made
that
suit
us.
put
the
fence
back.”
build
a
fence
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
today
and
say
to
certain
of
the
white
children,
“no
you
may
not
go
to
school
a
because
all
white
children
can't
congregate
there
and
because
some
of
you
are
white
you
must
go
to
school
b.”
and
to
say
to
the
colored
children,
“no
you
may
not
all
go
to
school
b,
you
must
go
to
school
a,
because
we
can't
have
you
congregating
in
school
b.”
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
going
full
circle,
the
case
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
but
for
what
reason
your
honor?
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
your
honor
that
is
the
vehicle
which
would
be
used.
that
is
the
device
which
would
be
used
to
do
it,
but
for
what
reason?
it's
just
inconceivable
to
me
that
i
stand
before
this
court,
the
highest
court
in
this
land
this
morning,
defending
the
school
board
of
new
kent
county.
and
at
this
very
moment
in
new
kent
county
we're
denying
somebody
something.
we're
denying
equal
protection
of
the
law.
that's
what
they
say.
i
don't
--
they
went
to
the
decisions
doesn't
bother
me.
are
we
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
that's
what
we
have
to
square
with
and
at
this
very
moment
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
every
child
in
the
county
just
happens
by
coincidence
the
choice
period
is
open
right
now.
from
now
till
the
first
of
may
and
every
child
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
has
one
of
these
choices.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes.
no
white
child
have
applied
to
go
to
colored
school.
no,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
sir.
not
unless
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
free
choice
of
an
american
citizen
is
a
booby-traps
and
this
plan
has
booby-traps.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
deliberate
speed
to
what
your
honor?
deliberate
speed
to
the
granting
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
not
to
the
integration
of
a
school
system.
not
to
the
integration
of
a
school
system.
i
ask
you
sir,
who
is
the
plaintiff
in
those
lawsuits?
i
think
you
get
to
the
question
there.
who
is
the
plaintiff?
who
can
stand
before
the
bar
of
this
court
and
say
to
this
court
“i
am
being
denied
my
equal
rights
when
i
can
--“
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
but
sir,
by
signing
this
piece
of
paper,
you
may
go
to
either
school
that
the
county
offers.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no.
if
your
honor
please,
over
three
years
of
operation
of
this
plan,
first
year
35
white
children
chose
to
go
--
colored
children
chose
to
go
to
the
--
your
honor
asked
me
a
question
about
the
indians
let
me
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
let
me
parenthetically
explain
that
situation.
there
had
been
for
years
indian
tribes
who
lived
on
reservations
in
new
kent
and
charles
city
county,
virginia.
they
wanted
their
own
school
system
and
they
had
their
own
school
system
until
the
adoption
of
the
freedom
of
choice
plan
being
modeled
on
the
guidelines
of
hew
which
say
that
you
may
not
transport
children
out
of
the
a
county
or
into
a
county
to
preserve
any
form
of
racial
segregation.
and
for
that
reason
we
had
to
take
away
from
the
indians
the
schools
that
they
would
have
preferred
to
keep,
but
they
chose
the
school
to
which
they
went
just
like
every
other
child
in
the
county.
but
your
honor,
it's
just
inconceivable
that
anyone
could
stand
here
and
say
to
this
court
“i'm
being
denied
equal
protection”
because
as
your
honor
said
in
brown
i
“public
education,
when
the
state
undertakes
to
provide,
must
be
given
to
all
on
the
equal
terms.”
now,
i
say
to
your
honor
that
any
child
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
can
get
any
educational
facility
which
new
kent
county
offers
by
the
mere
signing
of
his
name.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
sir.
that
would
not
be
freedom
of
choice.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
in
this
case
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
the
case
before
this
court
in
the
fourth
circuit,
there
was
an
admission
before
the
bar
of
the
court,
judge
hanesworth
took
into
consideration
the
very
pipe
of
factors
that
you
are
mentioning.
and
he
said
“of
course,
if
there
were
any
extraneous
pressures
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
free
choice.”
but
there
is
an
admission
before
the
bar
of
the
court
in
this
case
that
the
choices
are
free
and
unrestricted.
and
in
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
sir?
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
that
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
68
of
the
appendix,
it's
in
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
in
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
at
page
22.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
in
the
appendix
sir
at
page
68
is
judge
hanesworth's
statement.
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
appellants
at
page
22
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
white
brief
at
page
22,
they
say,
“to
be
sure
each
child
was
given
the
unrestricted
right
to
attend
any
school
in
the
system.”
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
they
are
quoting
there,
if
your
honor
please,
from
the
guidelines
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
stating
of
this
situation
across
the
country
general.
but
in
this
case
which
was
presented
to
a
court
of
law,
counsel
for
the
appellant
admitted
that
the
children
have
a
free
and
un-incumbent
choice.
if
we're
not
--
we're
talking
about
free
choice
plans
and
that's
something
else,
but
what
we
would
talk
about
is
where
they
do
have
a
free
choice.
and
in
this
county,
115
children
of
the
colored
race
have
elected
to
go
to
the
white
schools.
they
are
going
to
the
white
schools.
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
offered
by
anyone
that
anyone
of
them
has
been
in
any
way
abused,
that
any
parent
has
lost
his
job,
that
any
pressure
has
been
exerted
and
the
school
board
in
notifying
the
parents
of
their
plan
tell
them
that
they
will
be
admitted
to
the
school
of
their
choice
to
all
of
its
activities
that
there
will
be
no
coercion,
no
punishment
nothing
of
any
kind
to
use
against
them.
so
it
just
isn't
in
this
case
to
say
that
there
are
pressures.
in
new
kent
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i'm
sorry
that
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
any
reason
why
the
plan
--
why
one
plan
was
chosen
over
another?
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there
is
nothing
to
show
why
they
chose
the
freedom
of
choice
plan.
no,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
115
negroes
attending
new
kent
school,
yes
sir.
and
of
course
your
honor,
as
i
said,
the
freedom
of
choice
period
is
open
at
this
moment.
we
don't
know
what
choices
will
be
made
for
this
coming
school
year.
your
honor
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
sir.
there
is
not.
there
--
now
if
i
may
answer
to
as
to
this
115
children
specifically,
no,
sir.
the
record
does
show
in
answer
to
interrogatories
and
in
the
utterance
which
was
developed
that
generally
the
pattern
of
residences
is
throughout
the
county.
there's
no
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there's
--
i
do
not
know
sir
and
the
record
does
not
show.
i
do
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there're
busses
to
take
the
children
to
both
schools.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
would
be
transported
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
sir.
the
busses
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
the
busses
serve
the
schools,
if
you
go
to
the
school
that
this
bus
is
going
to
you
ride
that
bus.
there's
no
--
there's
no
segregation
on
the
busses.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
watkins
area
if
that
is
the
choice
that
they
make,
yes
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
sir
what
the
court
would
say,
but
i
know
what
hew
would
say,
because
they
very
specifically
and
of
course
in
the
adoption
of
the
plan,
we
also
adopt
this
provision.
they
are
so
fearful
of
the
subtle
pressure
that
mr.
justice
marshall
is
speaking
about
that
they
would
never
permit
you
to
question
why
he
was
--
why
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
your
honor,
but
i
can
say
to
you
why
they
were
made.
they
were
made
because
in
a
role
of
virginia
county
the
colored
school
is
the
community
center
of
colored
activity.
it's
the
hub
of
their
social.
they
don't
want
to
loose
that
school.
this
is
the
heart
of
their
social
life
and
their
community
center.
they
--
they
go
to
that
school
because
they
want
to
go
there.
in
my
home
city,
my
home
of
hoopla,
we
want
to
--
thought
was
given
to
consolidating
the
high
school
into
one
high
school
that
was
--
they
were
based
on
residential
patterns.
it
was
a
colored
high
school
which
was
on
one
side
of
the
town,
the
white
high
school
on
the
other.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
the
white
child
parent
certainly
can
not
choose
to
go
to
a
segregated
school,
because
he
does
not
go
to
segregated
school.
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
if,
your
honor,
if
we
were
going
to
--
the
only
way
you
could
do
that
is
to
say
that
no
one
but
white
will
go
here
and
this
isn't
the
case.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
it
would
be
for
people
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
it
would
be
permissible
under
this
plan,
and
i
think
it
would
be
permissible
on
the
constitution.
your
honor
if
i
may
answer
you
in
this
way,
i
have
time
to
make
this
answer.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
it
seems
to
me
that
prior
to
brown,
the
government
of
my
state
and
the
government
of
many
states
for
reasons
sufficient
to
the
government
determined
that
it's
better
for
one
reason
or
another,
it's
better
that
white
children
go
to
one
school
and
colored
children
go
to
another
school.
this
court
struck
that
down
and
said,
“you
may
not
have
compulsory
segregation.”
and
when
it
was
stricken
down,
this
county
at
least
said,
“all
right,
i'll
answer
to
that.
just
let
every
child
go
where
he
wants
to
go.
we
deny
no
one
anything.
and
now,
people
stand
before
this
court
and
say
to
you
the
right
choices
aren't
being
made
and
the
only
reason
that
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
parent,
guardian
or
if
the
child
had
reached
the
ninth
grade
or
is
15
years
old
he
may
make
his
own
choice.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
either
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
i
think
you
would
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
plan
was
conceived
sir
by
school
board
which
had
the
duty,
a
sworn
duty
to
try
to
preserve
public
education
and
to
better
public
education
in
new
kent
county.
they
had
before
them,
certainly
in
law
at
least,
some
alternatives.
i
presume
they
could
have,
if
they
chose,
put
the
name
of
every
first
grade
child
in
a
paper
bag
and
say,
“all
right,
we'll
do
it
by
lottery.
we'll
pull
out
and
this
child
will
go
to
this
school
and
this
child
will
go
to
this
school
regardless.”
they
could
have
done
it
by
pairing
the
schools,
one
as
an
elementary
school
one
as
a
high
school,
but
as
long
as
they
did
in
a
manner
that
did
not
deny
in
any
child
the
equal
protection
of
the
law,
they
did
constitutionally.
they
chose
the
plan
which
they
felt
would
preserve
the
public
education
system
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
for
all
of
the
children
and
to
give
them
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
and
i
say
to
you
sir
that
there
is
not
a
child
in
new
kent
who
can
stand
before
this
court
and
say
that,
“the
school
board
of
new
kent
county
is
denying
me
anything.”
every
facility
is
open
to
him,
and
i
say
to
you
if
it
is
an
education,
an
integrated
education
if
that's
what
the
colored
plaintiff
wants
i
can
provide
it
for
him
this
morning
if
he's
in
the
courtroom.
he
need
only
to
sign
that
form
and
check
the
new
kent
school
and
he
will
have
a
fully
integrated
education.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
your
honor
that
i
can't.
new
kent
county
and
charles
city
county
were
adjoining
counties
both
of
them
have
a
colored
population
larger
than
the
white
population.
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
and
i
think
that
the
appellant
very
wisely
chose
not
to
proceed
with
the
charles
city
appeal
which
they
started
to
bring
here.
charles
city
county
has
progress
a
bit
to
follow
along
the
line.
in
charles
city
county
a
great
many
of
the
elected
officials
are
members
of
the
colored
race.
in
new
kent
county
of
the
governing
body,
there
are
four
men
on
the
governing
body.
one
of
the
members
of
the
governing
body
is
a
negro.
in
charles
city
county,
one
of
the
members
of
the
school
board
who
adopted
an
identical
freedom
of
choice
plan
is
a
negro
and
who
felt
that
if
we
afford
everyone
a
free
opportunity
to
go
everybody
wants
to
go,
we
do
not
deny
them
equal
protection.
i
do
not
believe
sir
that
there
is
any
community
activity.
the
race
relations
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
are
excellent.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
that
in
generally
speaking
sir
that
is
true.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
i
can
always
say
to
you
sir,
as
i
have
said
before
that
this
record
in
this
lawsuit
recites
in
the
court's
opinion
and
in
the
brief
filed
here
they
admitted
in
the
bar
of
the
court
they
have
free
and
unrestricted
choice.
and
if
you
want
to
send
us
back
on
evidentiary
hearing
as
to
whether
they
are
community
pressure
is
militating
against
their
choice,
that's
another
thing.
but
this
case
this
case
on
this
record
has
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
that
they
do
have
an
unrestricted
choice.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
about
what's
happened
in
that
county
for
a
hundred
years
before
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
i
think
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
i
think
that
is
in
your
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
that
it
did
that
into
consideration.
certainly,
it
was
entitled
to
it,
it
was
a
matter
of
law
up
until
the
brown
decision
that
it
was
constitutionally
permissible
to
have
separate
facilities,
and
this
court
had
put
its
stamp
of
approval
of
it.
so
i
think
that
what
you
should
do
is
look
at
what
has
happened
under
this
plan.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
to
see
if
this
plan
is
working
fairly.
look
at
what
has
happened
under
this
plan.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
as
i
understand
brown
its
purpose
was
to
strike
down
compulsory
segregation.
that
has
been
totally
and
completely
accomplished.
if
it
is
your
purpose
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
compulsory
integration
does
not
exist
in
new
kent
county,
virginia.
