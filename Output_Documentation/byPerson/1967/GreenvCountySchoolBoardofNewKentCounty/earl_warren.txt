chief

the
indians
were
assigned
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
white
scholl?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
reason
for
that
change?
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
i
ask
before
you
get
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
about
the
teaching
staff?
is
there
any
difference
on
the
teaching
staff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
notice
in
one
of
these
cases
at
least
the
negro
teachers
were
paid
about
$200.00
less
than
the
white
teachers.
is
there
anything
like
that
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
nothing
in
this.
chief

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
game
that
you've
mentioned
had
in
mind
that
the
players
would
try
to
repeat
it
accurately
or
that
they
would
try
to
distort
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
that
is
comparable
to
these
segregation
cases
we've
had
in
recent
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
consideration
did
they
give
between
1954
and
1965
in
this
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
the
--
when
was
that
act
repealed
to
the
state
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
has
been
uniformly
accepted?
has
that
dicta
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
fifth
circuit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
fifth
circuit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
there
ever
been
a
white
child
admitted
to
the
colored
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is,
isn't
in
that
result
then
that
although
they
took
down
the
fence,
they
put
booby-traps
in
the
place
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
there
won't
be
any
white
children
go
to
a
negro
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
in
the
experience
of
three
years
in
that
county
where
there
never
has
been
a
white
child
go
to
a
--
the
negro
school,
isn't
that
some
indication
that
it
was
designed
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
booby-trap
there
for
them
that
they
couldn't
--
didn't
dare
to
go
over?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
didn't
we
say
in
brown
that
we
couldn't
let
the
feelings
of
the
community
delay
this
deliberate
speed
that
we
spoke
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
if
i
was
a
negro
in
kent
county,
i
would
say
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
social
and
cultural
influences
and
the
prejudices
that
have
existed
for
century
there
are
themselves
written
into
that
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
say
to
us
that
there
are
no
community
attitudes
to
pervade
that
copy
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
would
militate
against
a
negro
child
saying
that
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
white
school.
can
you
say
that
to
us
honestly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
we
find
though
in
many
counties
that
the
larger
negro
population,
percentage
wise,
the
greater
the
animosity
is
toward
their
participation
in
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
also
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
large
size
of
negro
population
in
new
kent
county
wouldn't
bring
one
normally
to
believe
what
you
just
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
aren't
we
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
what
has
happened
in
that
county
for
a
hundred
years
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
--
your
segregation
in
all
things,
not
only
in
schools
but
in
everything.
your
busses
and
your
trains
and
everything
else
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
will
you
segregate
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
in
your
title?
aren't
we
entitled
and
wasn't
the
court
entitled
below?
shouldn't
it
have
taken
those
things
into
consideration
in
determining
whether
this
was
an
honest
effort
to
desegregate
these
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
relation
to
anything
that's
gone
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
accomplishing
the
purpose
of
brown
or
his
progeny
when
there
hasn't
been
a
single
white
child
go
to
that
school
that
is
entirely
negro?
is
that
accomplishing
any
purpose
for
brown?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
referred
those
cases
to
the
district
court
for
accomplishing
that
purpose.
has
the
purpose
been
accomplished?
chief

mr.
