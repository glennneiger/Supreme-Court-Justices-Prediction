and
the

was
'65.
justice
thurgood

you
didn't
have
it
before

justice
thurgood

well,
do
you

was
adopted
without
regard
to
race
or
color?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
had
--
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
giving
children
freedom
of
choice
and
there
was
no
question
of
the
race
problem
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
--
was
it
brought
about
because
of
the
brown
decision
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
race
was
involved
in
the
adoption
of
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
was
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
mr.
gray,
was
it
adopted
with
any
purpose
other
than
to
perpetuate
as
much
segregation
as
you
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
gray,
on
this
freedom
of
choice,
so
many
negro
parents
wants
to
choose
to
send
his
child
to
the
--
what
the
label
for
the
purpose
is
the
previous
white
school.
as
employer
says
“i
suggest
that
you
not
do
it”
would
that
be
freedom
of
choice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
that's
happened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
a
different
county
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is

justice
thurgood

i
also
see
a

thing.
the

nature
of

affected
long
standard
community
attitudes
often
tend
to
include
or
inhibit
the
exercise
of
a
truly
free
choice
by

for
minority
group
students.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
in
the

any
place
the

that
this
plan
was
chosen

than
some
other

justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the

to
show
that
the
school
board
of

county
adopted
this
