mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit.
the
case
involves
the
public
schools
of
new
kent
county,
virginia.
there
are
but
two
such
schools,
each
with
its
elementary
and
high
school
department
serving
grades
1
through
12.
there
is
no
residential
segregation
in
new
kent
county.
white
families
and
negro
families
live
in
every
part
of
the
county,
yet
three
years
ago
no
child
of
either
race
have
been
brought
into
contact
with
persons
of
the
other
race
as
a
part
of
his
normal
daily
public
school
experience.
in
march
of
1956
when
this
action
was
commenced,
some
739
negro
children
attended
george
watkins
located
in
the
western
half
of
the
county,
and
some
522
white
children
attended
new
kent
school
located
in
the
eastern
half
of
the
county.
18
indian
children
living
in
new
kent
county
were
transported
by
public
school
to
sumari
indian
school
in
adjoining
charles
city
county.
for
more
than
ten
years,
the
county
school
board
of
new
kent
has
simply
ignored
this
court
decision
in
school
segregation
cases
and
we
submit
they
had
no
intention
of
complying
unless
required.
negro
citizens
of
the
county
petitioned
the
school
board
to
end
racial
segregation
in
the
school
system.
they
too
were
ignored.
on
march
15,
1965,
36
negro
school
children
and
their
parents
brought
this
class
action
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
praying
that
the
school
board
be
required
to
adopt
and
forthwith
implement
a
plan
which
will
provide
for
the
prompt
and
efficient
elimination
of
racial
segregation
in
the
public
schools.
this
action
so
far
as
its
heading,
brought
in
a
result,
be
as
well
have
been
ignored.
on
june
1,
1965
when
the
defendants
answered,
they
said
in
effect
that
the
school
board
has
no
due
to
the
desegregate
the
schools
and
if
any
negro
parent
was
unhappy
about
the
attendance
of
his
child
at
the
watkins
school,
you
need
only
to
apply
to
the
virginia
people
placement
board
for
transfer
of
the
child
to
the
new
kent
school.
such
--
and
such
is
the
board's
position
today,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
board
has
reassumed
irresponsibility
of
assignment
and
transfers,
and
the
further
fact
of
the
state
people
placement
board
no
longer
exists.
after
the
school
board
--
the
school
officials
had
filed
their
answer,
they
found
themselves
faced,
as
many
school
boards
around
the
country,
are
faced
with
the
threat
of
loosing
federal
funds
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
so,
like
most
of
the
school
boards
in
the
south,
the
new
kent
board
on
august
2,
1965
while
the
litigation
was
pending,
adopted
what
was
basically
a
standard
freedom
of
choice
plan
meeting
what
were
then
the
minimum
requirements
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
essentially,
this
meant
that
any
child
or
his
parents
could
only
before
may
31
of
any
year
choose
whether
the
child
would
attend
the
new
kent
school
or
the
watkins
school.
now
of
course
the
predictable
practicality
of
the
adoption
of
the
freedom
of
choice
plan
was
that
no
white
parent
was
going
to
choose
for
his
child
to
attend
the
watkins
school,
and
only
the
more
aggressive
negro
parents
would
risk
their
child
being
an
unwanted
intruder
at
the
new
kent
school.
on
june
28,
1966
the
district
court
approved
the
plan
as
supplemented.
there
were
some
additions
to
provide
for
faculty
desegregation
which
did
not
come
in
effect
however
the
following
year.
the
case
was
retained
on
the
docket
with
the
lead
to
either
pardon
or
to
seek
further
relief.
the
court's
memorandum
noting
that
it
may
be
necessary,
or
may
become
necessary
to
revoke
in
full
or
in
part
the
approval
which
the
court
had
given
the
plan.
but
meanwhile,
35
negro
children
had
broken
tradition
by
enrolling
in
the
new
kent
school
in
the
fall
of
1965.
on
appeal
by
the
plaintiffs,
this
case
was,
and
the
case
against
the
county
school
board
of
charles
city
county,
it
was
bowman
or
cole,
were
argued
in
the
fourth
circuit
on
january
9,
1967.
and
at
that
time,
some
111
negro
children
had
obtained
assignments
in
new
kent
school.
no
white
child
was
enrolled
in
watkins
school
and
no
white
person
taught
at
watkins.
one
negro
teacher
visited
new
kent
two
days
per
week
or
the
equivalent
day.
indian
children
were
still
being
transported
to
sumari
school
over
in
charles
city
county
at
all
times
before.
and
today,
the
picture
in
new
kent
is
just
slightly
altered
from
that.
the
indian
children
are
now,
ten
indian
children
are
now
attend
new
kent
school.
some
115
negro
children,
an
increase
of
four
over
the
previous
year,
attend
new
kent
school,
but
621
and
that's
54%
of
the
county's
negro
school
children
attend
watkins
school
completely
isolated
from
all
of
their
white
and
indian
citizens
except
one
white
teacher
who
was
assigned
to
watkins
school
initially
this
year.
such
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
indians
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
indians
were
assigned
to
the
white
school
beginning
of
this
year.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
don't
know
whether
there's
pressure
over
in
hew
where
--
it
probably
was
a
requirement
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
i'm
only
surmising
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
of
such
are
the
facts
14
years
after
this
court
concluded
that
in
the
field
of
public
education,
the
doctrine
of
separate
but
equal
has
no
place.
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
were
rendered
on
june
12,
1967,
the
basis
for
the
decisions
being
in
the
brown
versus
county
school
board
of
green
county
case.
the
majority
opinion
by
chief
judge
hanesworth
states
what
we
consider
two
contradictory
propositions
which
we
feel
this
court
has
to
resolve.
first,
the
majority
says
and
nobody
would
disagree
with
the
abstract
statement,
that
the
burden
of
extracting
individual
pupils
from
discriminatory
racial
assignments
may
not
be
cast
upon
their
parents.
but,
the
holding
of
the
majority
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
abstract
statement
where
they
said
that
the
school
board
may
not
be
required
to
make
compulsory
assignments
to
achieve
a
greater
intermixture
of
the
races,
or
as
is
otherwise
stated
by
the
majority
below,
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
he,
the
individual
pupil,
be
deprived
of
his
choice
freely
expressed.
in
sharp
contrast
with
this
holding,
judges
sobbeloff
and
winter
emphasized
what
we
think
the
true
constitutional
imperative
in
this
case
is.
and
that
is
the
freedom
of
choice
is
not
the
sacred
talisman,
it
is
only
a
means
to
a
constitutionally
required
in
the
abolition
of
the
system
of
segregation
and
its
effects.
using
as
nearly
as
channeling
which
suggested
by
the
respondents,
we
would
state
the
issue
here
as
in
these
words.
the
county
school
board
of
new
kent
county,
virginia
has
a
constitutional
duty
immediately
to
assign
children
to
each
of
the
public
schools
so
that
children
of
all
races
will
attend
schools
indiscriminately.
and
in
support
of
that,
we
argue
two
propositions,
the
brown
contemplated
that
this
school
system
would
long
since
have
been
converted
into
a
unitary
non-racial
system.
and
second,
the
freedom
of
choice
in
the
context
of
this
case
is
merely
an
impermissible
expedient
to
evade
the
constitutional
duty.
on
may
17,
1954
this
nation,
indeed
the
entire
world,
was
electrified
by
this
court's
holding
of
the
negro
children
being
segregated
of
the
public
schools,
were
being
denied
the
equal
protection
of
laws.
a
many
americans
were
jubilant.
some
were
relieved.
many
were
disappointed,
but
there
were
done
who
question
what
the
court
meant
when
it
decided
that
in
the
field
of
public
education,
the
doctrine
of
separate
but
equal
has
no
place.
from
that
point
of
departure,
americans
have
come
to
accept
the
demise
of
the
doctrine
of
separate
but
equal
in
other
areas,
but
it
still
lingers
in
the
area
in
which
this
court
first
pronounced
it
or
pronounced
its
demise.
having
settled
the
basic
issue,
the
court
then
addressed
to
counsel
and
directs
the
re-argument
upon
two
questions
including
a
question
for
which
posed
two
alternatives.
(a)
further
decree
would
necessary
to
follow
providing
that
within
the
limits
set
on
normal
geographic
school
districting,
negro
children
are
forthwith
be
admitted
to
schools
of
their
choice,
or
(b)
might
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
equate
to
powers
permit
an
effective
gradual
adjustment
to
be
brought
about
from
existing
segregate
system
to
a
system
not
based
on
colored
distinctions.
under
respondents
argue
in
their
brief
that
the
quandary
that
was
faced
in
the
court
at
that
time
was
freedom
of
choice
now
or
gradual
progression
to
a
system
which
would
allow
freedom
of
choice
in
some
indefinite
time
in
the
future.
we
do
not
so
read
the
questions
but
in
any
event,
this
court's
1955
resolution
of
its
question
number
four
said
nothing
about
the
choice
of
any
individual.
on
the
contrary,
the
court
directed
that
there
be
among
other
things,
revision
of
school
districts
and
attendance
areas
therein
into
compact
units
to
achieve
the
system
of
determining
admission
to
the
public
schools
on
a
non-racial
basis.
it
was
obvious
that
such
revision
in
large
and
complex
school
districts
would
require
more
time
than
would
be
required
for
a
simple
school
district
like
new
kent
county
with
two
separate
and
equal
schools.
hence
the
court
charged
the
district
courts
to
allow
time
when
necessary,
but
the
lower
courts
would
ere
to
be
bear
in
mind
that
the
burden
rests
upon
the
defendants
to
establish
that
such
time
is
necessary
in
the
public
interest
in
consistent
with
good
faith
compliance
at
the
earliest
practical
date.
in
new
kent
county
with
two
schools,
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
assign
all
children
in
the
western
part
of
the
county
to
watkins
school,
and
all
of
the
children
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
county
to
new
kent
school.
or
one
school
could've
been
made
the
elementary
school
and
one
school
could've
been
made
the
high
school.
either
these
could've
been
done
overnight
and
but
for
virginia's
infamous
massive
resistance,
we
say
that
the
earliest
practical
date
for
compliance
in
new
kent
county
was
the
first
day
of
school
in
the
1955.
the
respondents
do
not
suggest
in
their
brief
or
in
any
stage
in
these
proceedings
that
there
are
or
ever
have
been
obstacles
of
administrative
character
to
justify
delay
in
making
the
transition.
on
the
contrary,
they
have
deliberately
selected
the
only
available
alternative,
composite
though
it
may
be,
by
which
segregation
might
continue.
this
they
admit
where
on
pages
3
and
4
of
their
brief
they
say
that
their
adoption
of
freedom
of
choice
was
designed
to
honor
the
educational
imperative
of
the
system.
by
that
they
meaning,
that
if
they
should
desegregate
both
schools
that
white
patrons
would
withdraw
their
children
form
the
schools,
from
the
public
schools.
i
think
this
suggestion
was
answered
by
the
court
in
1955
when
it
said
that
it
should
go
without
saying
that
the
vitality
of
these
constitutional
principles
should
not
be
allowed
to
yield
simply
because
of
disagreement
with
them.
we
think
the
answer
was
reaffirmed
in
1958
when
this
court
considered
the
liberrock
case,
cooper
versus
errand.
we
think
the
same
answer
was
reaffirmed
in
1964
in
the
prince
ebert
county,
virginia
case
and
we
submit
that
on
january
15,
1968
when
this
court
affirmed
the
tuition
grant
case
from
louisiana
that
that
was
another
answer
--
sufficient
answer
to
that
threat
or
the
possible
to
white
persons
might
withdraw
their
children
from
the
public
schools.
we
submit
that
in
new
kent
county,
compliance
with
the
brown
mandate
is
long
overdue
that
the
time
for
deliberate
speed
has
long
rendered.
freedom
of
choice
in
new
kent
and
in
most
places
where
it's
been
adopted.
it's
just
another
expedient
to
avoid
compliance
with
brown
mandate.
if
a
residential
segregation
prevails,
school
boards
wishing
to
retain
segregated
schools
assign
children
to
schools
in
accordance
with
their
zones,
school
attendance
there
and
thereby
force
the
racial
segregation
of
children
in
the
public
schools.
such
a
case
before
this
court
in
1965
as
suppose
of
summarily,
guilan
versus
school
board
of
the
city
of
hoopa.
whereas
here,
residential
segregation
does
not
prevail,
the
school
board
pleads
it
should
not
force
children
to
attend
school
with
children
of
the
other
race.
force
is
seen
as
normal
government
regulation
when
its
use
retains
segregation.
the
school
board
seem
to
make
it
sound
horrible
when
used
with
reference
to
putting
children
of
both
races
into
public
schools
together.
new
kent
here
appoints
to
dicta
in
the
case
from
atlanta,
georgia
kelton
versus
latima
and
the
case
from
knoxville,
tennessee
gose
versus
board
of
education
as
justifying
the
adoption
of
freedom
of
choice
in
new
kent.
but
those
large
metropolitan
systems
it
seems
to
me
the
court
could
easily
and
could
easily
perceive
and
did
perceive
of
valid
reasons
why
persons
would
exercise
their
choice.
now
the
choice
in
a
large
system,
it
may
be
difference
in
curricular
or
other
differences
by
which
would
validate
a
parent's
choosing
one
school
rather
than
the
other.
but
in
new
kent
county,
the
only
choice
is
a
choice
of
the
white
school
or
the
colored
school.
and
we
submit
that
the
state
is
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
extend
such
choice
to
parents
and
thereby
permit
parents
to
accomplish
the
same
thing
that
the
state
is
forbidden
to
do
and
that
is
to
racially
segregate
children
in
the
public
schools.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
we
assume
physically
that
they
compare
that
they're
alike.
i
don't
know
of
any
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggest
otherwise
and
my
information
is
that
not
that
i've
heard
of
is
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
capacity
is
generally
the
same.
i
mean,
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
they're
more
or
less
equivalent.
the
negro
school
population
is
a
little
larger
than
the
white
school
population
but
i
don't
think
that
made
any
difference
in
the
size
of
the
schools,
i
could
be
wrong
with
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
each
one
has
an
elementary
and
high
school
department.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
yes.
this
is
the
19th
year
since
brown
too.
the
struggle
to
desegregation
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
today
there
is
one
teacher
assigned
to
the
watkins
school
which
is
the
negro
school
and
one
negro
teacher
as
i
take
it
be
from
the
figures
given
is
--
which
is
given
as
appoint
two
teacher
--
appoint
four,
teaches
two
days
a
week
at
the
new
kent
school
or
maybe
some
other
explanation
would
be
practical.
that's
my
surmise
on
it.
i
don't
--
we
didn't
develop
any
striking
difference
in
the
qualifications
of
the
teachers.
we
developed
--
we
served
the
derogatoriness
on
the
qualifications,
but
we
have
nothing
striking
that
we
would
present
to
the
court
to
suggest
that
the
--
inequality
of
the
schools.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
don't
think
that
reveals
there,
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
no.
no
issue
on
faculty
desegregation
here.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
circuit
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
do
something
more
about
faculty
desegregation
but
we
elected
to
bring
the
student
assignment
picture
here.
the
struggle
to
desegregate
the
general
public
schools
is
in
its
fourth
stage.
for
four
years,
1955
through
1959,
we
had
massive
resistance.
the
next
three
years,
1959
through
1962,
we
had
state
pupil
placement
board
or
local
school
boards
rejecting
the
application
of
negro
children
to
attend
white
schools
on
a
basis
of
criteria
which
would
not
apply
in
the
--
to
determine
the
admission
of
white
children
of
those
schools.
that
practice
was
struck
down
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
may
and
in
june
1962.
then
for
three
years,
1962
through
1965,
we
had
freedom
of
choice
administered
by
the
state
pupil
placement
board.
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
came
to
the
picture
effective
of
the
fall
of
1965.
now
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
is
seeking
to
expand
or
to
accelerate
the
desegregation
of
schools,
but
they
can
only
require
such
speed
as
the
judicial
opinion
seems
to
require.
today,
the
new
kent
school
board
says
that
if
any
of
the
inequalities
that
noted
in
the
brown
decision
managed
to
survive
the
fourth
circuit
striking
down
of
the
discriminatory
criteria
that
they
were
clearly
overcome
and
everything
was
made
all
right
on
august
2,
1965
as
if
by
the
wave
of
a
magic
wand
when
the
new
kent
school
board
formally
adopted
the
plan
label
freedom
of
choice.
they
said
that
was
all
they
have
to
do
the
schools
--
by
that
act
desegregated.
by
its
own
resolution
the
claims
to
have
become
a
neutral
party
without
interest
in
and
without
responsible
for
the
continuing
struggle
between
those
who
want
new
kent
school
desegregated
--
to
be
segregated,
and
those
who
want
every
vestige
of
segregation
to
be
removed.
and
these
kinds
of
struggles
are
going
to
continue
as
long
as
school
boards
and
federal
judges
can
read
judicial
dicta
and
make
semantic
arguments
contending
that
public
authorities
not
required
to
use
a
more
or
the
most
expeditious
means
of
accomplishing
total
rather
than
token
desegregation.
and
the
most
famous
of
such
dicta
is
one
that
was
composed
45
days,
i
believe
it
was,
after
this
court's
remand
of
the
brown
cases
and
the
one
called
briggs
versus
elliot,
the
one
that
came
from
claren
county,
south
carolina.
and
the
court
had
convened
with
counsel
to
consult
the
type
of
decree
to
be
entered
and
before
counsel
had
an
opportunity
to
make
a
suggestion
what
judge
parker
read
from
the
bench,
the
what
has
become
a
very
famous
and
much
quoted
dictum
and
is
there
that
sprung
the
notion
as
he
said
that
the
supreme
court
had
not
decided
that
the
states
with
mixed
races,
persons
of
different
races
in
the
school
almost
deprived
them
of
the
right
of
choosing
the
schools
that
they
attend.
or
as
the
otherwise
expressed
it
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
integration,
it
merely
forbids
discrimination.
now,
the
--
in
analyzing
that
dictum,
the
factual
basis
what
was
entirely
false,
because
at
that
time
they
never
had
been
there
never
was
any
right
of
persons
to
choose
what
school
they
would
attend.
not
in
the
--
and
certainly
not
in
new
kent
county
no
where
in
virginia
and
i
dare
say
not
in
claren
county,
south
carolina.
but
now
in
the
language
of
the
fourth
circuit,
majority
in
this
very
case,
that
right
so
bluntly
assumed
has
been
accorded
an
overwriting
constitution
dimension.
the
legal
conclusion
stated
in
briggs
that
this
court
had
not
decided
that
the
state
must
mix
races
persons
or
different
races
in
the
public
schools,
and
the
constitution
merely
forbids
the
use
of
government
power
to
enforce
segregation.
those
legal
conclusions
were
in
the
very
teeth
of
what
the
court
had
just
held
that
the
states
failure
to
mix
persons
of
different
races
in
public
schools
denied
the
negro
children
of
equal
protection
of
laws.
the
briggs
doctrine
has
been
very
thoroughly
analyzed
from
the
historical
and
the
cases
referring
to
it
had
been
collected
by
judge
wisdom
in
united
states
versus
jefferson
county
372
f2d
at
386
beginning
at
page
861.
the
briggs
doctrine
was
very
summarily
rejected
by
judges
sobbeloff
and
winter
in
this
very
case,
but
unfortunately,
it
is
still
living
law
as
far
as
the
fourth
circuit
is
concerned
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
so
we
urge
in
the
words
of
judge
wisdom
written
in
the
case
of
singleton
versus
jackson
in
1965
that
it
is
time
that
judge
parker's
dictum
in
briggs
versus
elliot
were
laid
to
rest.
we
ask
that
the
case
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
we
understood
that
the
rebuttal
would
be
done
at
the
end
of
the
three
cases.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
after
solicitor
general's
argument.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit.
the
case
involves
the
public
schools
of
new
kent
county,
virginia.
there
are
but
two
such
schools,
each
with
its
elementary
and
high
school
department
serving
grades
1
through
12.
there
is
no
residential
segregation
in
new
kent
county.
white
families
and
negro
families
live
in
every
part
of
the
county,
yet
three
years
ago
no
child
of
either
race
have
been
brought
into
contact
with
persons
of
the
other
race
as
a
part
of
his
normal
daily
public
school
experience.
in
march
of
1956
when
this
action
was
commenced,
some
739
negro
children
attended
george
watkins
located
in
the
western
half
of
the
county,
and
some
522
white
children
attended
new
kent
school
located
in
the
eastern
half
of
the
county.
18
indian
children
living
in
new
kent
county
were
transported
by
public
school
to
sumari
indian
school
in
adjoining
charles
city
county.
for
more
than
ten
years,
the
county
school
board
of
new
kent
has
simply
ignored
this
court
decision
in
school
segregation
cases
and
we
submit
they
had
no
intention
of
complying
unless
required.
negro
citizens
of
the
county
petitioned
the
school
board
to
end
racial
segregation
in
the
school
system.
they
too
were
ignored.
on
march
15,
1965,
36
negro
school
children
and
their
parents
brought
this
class
action
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
praying
that
the
school
board
be
required
to
adopt
and
forthwith
implement
a
plan
which
will
provide
for
the
prompt
and
efficient
elimination
of
racial
segregation
in
the
public
schools.
this
action
so
far
as
its
heading,
brought
in
a
result,
be
as
well
have
been
ignored.
on
june
1,
1965
when
the
defendants
answered,
they
said
in
effect
that
the
school
board
has
no
due
to
the
desegregate
the
schools
and
if
any
negro
parent
was
unhappy
about
the
attendance
of
his
child
at
the
watkins
school,
you
need
only
to
apply
to
the
virginia
people
placement
board
for
transfer
of
the
child
to
the
new
kent
school.
such
--
and
such
is
the
board's
position
today,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
board
has
reassumed
irresponsibility
of
assignment
and
transfers,
and
the
further
fact
of
the
state
people
placement
board
no
longer
exists.
after
the
school
board
--
the
school
officials
had
filed
their
answer,
they
found
themselves
faced,
as
many
school
boards
around
the
country,
are
faced
with
the
threat
of
loosing
federal
funds
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
so,
like
most
of
the
school
boards
in
the
south,
the
new
kent
board
on
august
2,
1965
while
the
litigation
was
pending,
adopted
what
was
basically
a
standard
freedom
of
choice
plan
meeting
what
were
then
the
minimum
requirements
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
essentially,
this
meant
that
any
child
or
his
parents
could
only
before
may
31
of
any
year
choose
whether
the
child
would
attend
the
new
kent
school
or
the
watkins
school.
now
of
course
the
predictable
practicality
of
the
adoption
of
the
freedom
of
choice
plan
was
that
no
white
parent
was
going
to
choose
for
his
child
to
attend
the
watkins
school,
and
only
the
more
aggressive
negro
parents
would
risk
their
child
being
an
unwanted
intruder
at
the
new
kent
school.
on
june
28,
1966
the
district
court
approved
the
plan
as
supplemented.
there
were
some
additions
to
provide
for
faculty
desegregation
which
did
not
come
in
effect
however
the
following
year.
the
case
was
retained
on
the
docket
with
the
lead
to
either
pardon
or
to
seek
further
relief.
the
court's
memorandum
noting
that
it
may
be
necessary,
or
may
become
necessary
to
revoke
in
full
or
in
part
the
approval
which
the
court
had
given
the
plan.
but
meanwhile,
35
negro
children
had
broken
tradition
by
enrolling
in
the
new
kent
school
in
the
fall
of
1965.
on
appeal
by
the
plaintiffs,
this
case
was,
and
the
case
against
the
county
school
board
of
charles
city
county,
it
was
bowman
or
cole,
were
argued
in
the
fourth
circuit
on
january
9,
1967.
and
at
that
time,
some
111
negro
children
had
obtained
assignments
in
new
kent
school.
no
white
child
was
enrolled
in
watkins
school
and
no
white
person
taught
at
watkins.
one
negro
teacher
visited
new
kent
two
days
per
week
or
the
equivalent
day.
indian
children
were
still
being
transported
to
sumari
school
over
in
charles
city
county
at
all
times
before.
and
today,
the
picture
in
new
kent
is
just
slightly
altered
from
that.
the
indian
children
are
now,
ten
indian
children
are
now
attend
new
kent
school.
some
115
negro
children,
an
increase
of
four
over
the
previous
year,
attend
new
kent
school,
but
621
and
that's
54%
of
the
county's
negro
school
children
attend
watkins
school
completely
isolated
from
all
of
their
white
and
indian
citizens
except
one
white
teacher
who
was
assigned
to
watkins
school
initially
this
year.
such
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
indians
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
indians
were
assigned
to
the
white
school
beginning
of
this
year.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
don't
know
whether
there's
pressure
over
in
hew
where
--
it
probably
was
a
requirement
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
i'm
only
surmising
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
of
such
are
the
facts
14
years
after
this
court
concluded
that
in
the
field
of
public
education,
the
doctrine
of
separate
but
equal
has
no
place.
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
were
rendered
on
june
12,
1967,
the
basis
for
the
decisions
being
in
the
brown
versus
county
school
board
of
green
county
case.
the
majority
opinion
by
chief
judge
hanesworth
states
what
we
consider
two
contradictory
propositions
which
we
feel
this
court
has
to
resolve.
first,
the
majority
says
and
nobody
would
disagree
with
the
abstract
statement,
that
the
burden
of
extracting
individual
pupils
from
discriminatory
racial
assignments
may
not
be
cast
upon
their
parents.
but,
the
holding
of
the
majority
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
abstract
statement
where
they
said
that
the
school
board
may
not
be
required
to
make
compulsory
assignments
to
achieve
a
greater
intermixture
of
the
races,
or
as
is
otherwise
stated
by
the
majority
below,
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
he,
the
individual
pupil,
be
deprived
of
his
choice
freely
expressed.
in
sharp
contrast
with
this
holding,
judges
sobbeloff
and
winter
emphasized
what
we
think
the
true
constitutional
imperative
in
this
case
is.
and
that
is
the
freedom
of
choice
is
not
the
sacred
talisman,
it
is
only
a
means
to
a
constitutionally
required
in
the
abolition
of
the
system
of
segregation
and
its
effects.
using
as
nearly
as
channeling
which
suggested
by
the
respondents,
we
would
state
the
issue
here
as
in
these
words.
the
county
school
board
of
new
kent
county,
virginia
has
a
constitutional
duty
immediately
to
assign
children
to
each
of
the
public
schools
so
that
children
of
all
races
will
attend
schools
indiscriminately.
and
in
support
of
that,
we
argue
two
propositions,
the
brown
contemplated
that
this
school
system
would
long
since
have
been
converted
into
a
unitary
non-racial
system.
and
second,
the
freedom
of
choice
in
the
context
of
this
case
is
merely
an
impermissible
expedient
to
evade
the
constitutional
duty.
on
may
17,
1954
this
nation,
indeed
the
entire
world,
was
electrified
by
this
court's
holding
of
the
negro
children
being
segregated
of
the
public
schools,
were
being
denied
the
equal
protection
of
laws.
a
many
americans
were
jubilant.
some
were
relieved.
many
were
disappointed,
but
there
were
done
who
question
what
the
court
meant
when
it
decided
that
in
the
field
of
public
education,
the
doctrine
of
separate
but
equal
has
no
place.
from
that
point
of
departure,
americans
have
come
to
accept
the
demise
of
the
doctrine
of
separate
but
equal
in
other
areas,
but
it
still
lingers
in
the
area
in
which
this
court
first
pronounced
it
or
pronounced
its
demise.
having
settled
the
basic
issue,
the
court
then
addressed
to
counsel
and
directs
the
re-argument
upon
two
questions
including
a
question
for
which
posed
two
alternatives.
(a)
further
decree
would
necessary
to
follow
providing
that
within
the
limits
set
on
normal
geographic
school
districting,
negro
children
are
forthwith
be
admitted
to
schools
of
their
choice,
or
(b)
might
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
equate
to
powers
permit
an
effective
gradual
adjustment
to
be
brought
about
from
existing
segregate
system
to
a
system
not
based
on
colored
distinctions.
under
respondents
argue
in
their
brief
that
the
quandary
that
was
faced
in
the
court
at
that
time
was
freedom
of
choice
now
or
gradual
progression
to
a
system
which
would
allow
freedom
of
choice
in
some
indefinite
time
in
the
future.
we
do
not
so
read
the
questions
but
in
any
event,
this
court's
1955
resolution
of
its
question
number
four
said
nothing
about
the
choice
of
any
individual.
on
the
contrary,
the
court
directed
that
there
be
among
other
things,
revision
of
school
districts
and
attendance
areas
therein
into
compact
units
to
achieve
the
system
of
determining
admission
to
the
public
schools
on
a
non-racial
basis.
it
was
obvious
that
such
revision
in
large
and
complex
school
districts
would
require
more
time
than
would
be
required
for
a
simple
school
district
like
new
kent
county
with
two
separate
and
equal
schools.
hence
the
court
charged
the
district
courts
to
allow
time
when
necessary,
but
the
lower
courts
would
ere
to
be
bear
in
mind
that
the
burden
rests
upon
the
defendants
to
establish
that
such
time
is
necessary
in
the
public
interest
in
consistent
with
good
faith
compliance
at
the
earliest
practical
date.
in
new
kent
county
with
two
schools,
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
assign
all
children
in
the
western
part
of
the
county
to
watkins
school,
and
all
of
the
children
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
county
to
new
kent
school.
or
one
school
could've
been
made
the
elementary
school
and
one
school
could've
been
made
the
high
school.
either
these
could've
been
done
overnight
and
but
for
virginia's
infamous
massive
resistance,
we
say
that
the
earliest
practical
date
for
compliance
in
new
kent
county
was
the
first
day
of
school
in
the
1955.
the
respondents
do
not
suggest
in
their
brief
or
in
any
stage
in
these
proceedings
that
there
are
or
ever
have
been
obstacles
of
administrative
character
to
justify
delay
in
making
the
transition.
on
the
contrary,
they
have
deliberately
selected
the
only
available
alternative,
composite
though
it
may
be,
by
which
segregation
might
continue.
this
they
admit
where
on
pages
3
and
4
of
their
brief
they
say
that
their
adoption
of
freedom
of
choice
was
designed
to
honor
the
educational
imperative
of
the
system.
by
that
they
meaning,
that
if
they
should
desegregate
both
schools
that
white
patrons
would
withdraw
their
children
form
the
schools,
from
the
public
schools.
i
think
this
suggestion
was
answered
by
the
court
in
1955
when
it
said
that
it
should
go
without
saying
that
the
vitality
of
these
constitutional
principles
should
not
be
allowed
to
yield
simply
because
of
disagreement
with
them.
we
think
the
answer
was
reaffirmed
in
1958
when
this
court
considered
the
liberrock
case,
cooper
versus
errand.
we
think
the
same
answer
was
reaffirmed
in
1964
in
the
prince
ebert
county,
virginia
case
and
we
submit
that
on
january
15,
1968
when
this
court
affirmed
the
tuition
grant
case
from
louisiana
that
that
was
another
answer
--
sufficient
answer
to
that
threat
or
the
possible
to
white
persons
might
withdraw
their
children
from
the
public
schools.
we
submit
that
in
new
kent
county,
compliance
with
the
brown
mandate
is
long
overdue
that
the
time
for
deliberate
speed
has
long
rendered.
freedom
of
choice
in
new
kent
and
in
most
places
where
it's
been
adopted.
it's
just
another
expedient
to
avoid
compliance
with
brown
mandate.
if
a
residential
segregation
prevails,
school
boards
wishing
to
retain
segregated
schools
assign
children
to
schools
in
accordance
with
their
zones,
school
attendance
there
and
thereby
force
the
racial
segregation
of
children
in
the
public
schools.
such
a
case
before
this
court
in
1965
as
suppose
of
summarily,
guilan
versus
school
board
of
the
city
of
hoopa.
whereas
here,
residential
segregation
does
not
prevail,
the
school
board
pleads
it
should
not
force
children
to
attend
school
with
children
of
the
other
race.
force
is
seen
as
normal
government
regulation
when
its
use
retains
segregation.
the
school
board
seem
to
make
it
sound
horrible
when
used
with
reference
to
putting
children
of
both
races
into
public
schools
together.
new
kent
here
appoints
to
dicta
in
the
case
from
atlanta,
georgia
kelton
versus
latima
and
the
case
from
knoxville,
tennessee
gose
versus
board
of
education
as
justifying
the
adoption
of
freedom
of
choice
in
new
kent.
but
those
large
metropolitan
systems
it
seems
to
me
the
court
could
easily
and
could
easily
perceive
and
did
perceive
of
valid
reasons
why
persons
would
exercise
their
choice.
now
the
choice
in
a
large
system,
it
may
be
difference
in
curricular
or
other
differences
by
which
would
validate
a
parent's
choosing
one
school
rather
than
the
other.
but
in
new
kent
county,
the
only
choice
is
a
choice
of
the
white
school
or
the
colored
school.
and
we
submit
that
the
state
is
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
extend
such
choice
to
parents
and
thereby
permit
parents
to
accomplish
the
same
thing
that
the
state
is
forbidden
to
do
and
that
is
to
racially
segregate
children
in
the
public
schools.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
we
assume
physically
that
they
compare
that
they're
alike.
i
don't
know
of
any
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggest
otherwise
and
my
information
is
that
not
that
i've
heard
of
is
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
capacity
is
generally
the
same.
i
mean,
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
they're
more
or
less
equivalent.
the
negro
school
population
is
a
little
larger
than
the
white
school
population
but
i
don't
think
that
made
any
difference
in
the
size
of
the
schools,
i
could
be
wrong
with
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
each
one
has
an
elementary
and
high
school
department.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
yes.
this
is
the
19th
year
since
brown
too.
the
struggle
to
desegregation
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
today
there
is
one
teacher
assigned
to
the
watkins
school
which
is
the
negro
school
and
one
negro
teacher
as
i
take
it
be
from
the
figures
given
is
--
which
is
given
as
appoint
two
teacher
--
appoint
four,
teaches
two
days
a
week
at
the
new
kent
school
or
maybe
some
other
explanation
would
be
practical.
that's
my
surmise
on
it.
i
don't
--
we
didn't
develop
any
striking
difference
in
the
qualifications
of
the
teachers.
we
developed
--
we
served
the
derogatoriness
on
the
qualifications,
but
we
have
nothing
striking
that
we
would
present
to
the
court
to
suggest
that
the
--
inequality
of
the
schools.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
don't
think
that
reveals
there,
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
no.
no
issue
on
faculty
desegregation
here.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
circuit
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
do
something
more
about
faculty
desegregation
but
we
elected
to
bring
the
student
assignment
picture
here.
the
struggle
to
desegregate
the
general
public
schools
is
in
its
fourth
stage.
for
four
years,
1955
through
1959,
we
had
massive
resistance.
the
next
three
years,
1959
through
1962,
we
had
state
pupil
placement
board
or
local
school
boards
rejecting
the
application
of
negro
children
to
attend
white
schools
on
a
basis
of
criteria
which
would
not
apply
in
the
--
to
determine
the
admission
of
white
children
of
those
schools.
that
practice
was
struck
down
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
may
and
in
june
1962.
then
for
three
years,
1962
through
1965,
we
had
freedom
of
choice
administered
by
the
state
pupil
placement
board.
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
came
to
the
picture
effective
of
the
fall
of
1965.
now
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
is
seeking
to
expand
or
to
accelerate
the
desegregation
of
schools,
but
they
can
only
require
such
speed
as
the
judicial
opinion
seems
to
require.
today,
the
new
kent
school
board
says
that
if
any
of
the
inequalities
that
noted
in
the
brown
decision
managed
to
survive
the
fourth
circuit
striking
down
of
the
discriminatory
criteria
that
they
were
clearly
overcome
and
everything
was
made
all
right
on
august
2,
1965
as
if
by
the
wave
of
a
magic
wand
when
the
new
kent
school
board
formally
adopted
the
plan
label
freedom
of
choice.
they
said
that
was
all
they
have
to
do
the
schools
--
by
that
act
desegregated.
by
its
own
resolution
the
claims
to
have
become
a
neutral
party
without
interest
in
and
without
responsible
for
the
continuing
struggle
between
those
who
want
new
kent
school
desegregated
--
to
be
segregated,
and
those
who
want
every
vestige
of
segregation
to
be
removed.
and
these
kinds
of
struggles
are
going
to
continue
as
long
as
school
boards
and
federal
judges
can
read
judicial
dicta
and
make
semantic
arguments
contending
that
public
authorities
not
required
to
use
a
more
or
the
most
expeditious
means
of
accomplishing
total
rather
than
token
desegregation.
and
the
most
famous
of
such
dicta
is
one
that
was
composed
45
days,
i
believe
it
was,
after
this
court's
remand
of
the
brown
cases
and
the
one
called
briggs
versus
elliot,
the
one
that
came
from
claren
county,
south
carolina.
and
the
court
had
convened
with
counsel
to
consult
the
type
of
decree
to
be
entered
and
before
counsel
had
an
opportunity
to
make
a
suggestion
what
judge
parker
read
from
the
bench,
the
what
has
become
a
very
famous
and
much
quoted
dictum
and
is
there
that
sprung
the
notion
as
he
said
that
the
supreme
court
had
not
decided
that
the
states
with
mixed
races,
persons
of
different
races
in
the
school
almost
deprived
them
of
the
right
of
choosing
the
schools
that
they
attend.
or
as
the
otherwise
expressed
it
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
integration,
it
merely
forbids
discrimination.
now,
the
--
in
analyzing
that
dictum,
the
factual
basis
what
was
entirely
false,
because
at
that
time
they
never
had
been
there
never
was
any
right
of
persons
to
choose
what
school
they
would
attend.
not
in
the
--
and
certainly
not
in
new
kent
county
no
where
in
virginia
and
i
dare
say
not
in
claren
county,
south
carolina.
but
now
in
the
language
of
the
fourth
circuit,
majority
in
this
very
case,
that
right
so
bluntly
assumed
has
been
accorded
an
overwriting
constitution
dimension.
the
legal
conclusion
stated
in
briggs
that
this
court
had
not
decided
that
the
state
must
mix
races
persons
or
different
races
in
the
public
schools,
and
the
constitution
merely
forbids
the
use
of
government
power
to
enforce
segregation.
those
legal
conclusions
were
in
the
very
teeth
of
what
the
court
had
just
held
that
the
states
failure
to
mix
persons
of
different
races
in
public
schools
denied
the
negro
children
of
equal
protection
of
laws.
the
briggs
doctrine
has
been
very
thoroughly
analyzed
from
the
historical
and
the
cases
referring
to
it
had
been
collected
by
judge
wisdom
in
united
states
versus
jefferson
county
372
f2d
at
386
beginning
at
page
861.
the
briggs
doctrine
was
very
summarily
rejected
by
judges
sobbeloff
and
winter
in
this
very
case,
but
unfortunately,
it
is
still
living
law
as
far
as
the
fourth
circuit
is
concerned
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
so
we
urge
in
the
words
of
judge
wisdom
written
in
the
case
of
singleton
versus
jackson
in
1965
that
it
is
time
that
judge
parker's
dictum
in
briggs
versus
elliot
were
laid
to
rest.
we
ask
that
the
case
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
we
understood
that
the
rebuttal
would
be
done
at
the
end
of
the
three
cases.

samuel
