mr.
arnold
i.
shure
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
in
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
definition
of
security
in
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
in
connection
with
this
argument
that
as
i
state
the
facts
of
the
case
that
the
court
bare
in
mind
the
decisions,
many
of
which
are
of
recent
years
of
this
court
dealing
on
what
are
securities
and
what
the
purpose
of
the
1933
securities
act
and
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
is
although
the
direct
decision
of
this
court
on
the
1934
act
was
on
the
recent
case
of
surowitz
versus
hilton
hotels
corporation
and
this
court
set
out
a
strong
statement
of
the
fact
that
the
primary
aim
and
purpose
of
the
1934
act
as
well
as
the
1933
act
is
the
protection
of
the
general
public
and
investors
including
the
uninformed,
the
gullible,
the
ignorant
and
the
little
investors.
judge
cummings
dissented
on
the
opinion
--
majority
opinion
of
the
court
in
our
matter
and
his
opinion
sets
forth
the
aims
and
purposes
of
the
1934
act
and
that
they
are
served
by
the
application
of
that
act
to
the
typical
savings
and
loan
accounts
holder
who
was
a
small
investor
who
was
just
as
unwary
and
in
need
of
protection
of
the
typical
and
sophisticated
holder
of
corporate
stock.
now
the
other
cases
pertaining
to
the
1933
act
that
i
think
are
particularly
important
here
are
the
securities
and
exchange
commission

w.j.

1946.

of

--
and
the
capital
gains
research
case
which
involves
another
section
of
the
act
but
still
dealt
with
the
overall
purpose.
this
action
was
brought
pursuant
to
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
act
and
rule
10(b)(5)
promulgated
there
under.
the
respondents
here
and
the
defendants
below
are
the
city
savings
association
which
is
an
insolvent
savings
to
loan
association
which
has
closed
its
doors
and
is
now
in
the
process
of
liquidations.
its
officers
and
directors,
the
liquidators
or
purported
liquidators
and
certain
officials
of
the
state
of
illinois
who
had
seized
custody
of
the
association
at
the
time
the
complaint
herein
was
filed.
the
petitioners
are
about
150
investors
in
the
capital
shares
of
city
savings
association
pursuing
on
their
own
behalf
and
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
over
5,000
investors
who
purchased
their
shares
after
july
24,
1959
and
prior
to
the
closing
on
june
26,
1964
just
short
of
five
years.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
only
relevance
of
the
date
is
that
all
of
the
investors
who
were
there
prior
to
july
24,
1959
were
investors
prior
to
1957
because
in
1957,
the
association
had
been
closed
by
the
state
of
illinois
and
then
reopened.
the
accounts
were
frozen
and
the
people
couldn’t
withdraw.
so
these
people
were
in
the
plate
that
they’re
still
in
except
for
the
fact
that
they’ve
been
able
to
realize
some
recovery
of
their
interest
out
of
the
new
moneys
which
we
claim
were
received
from
our
clients
in
the
class
we
represent,
through
misrepresentation
and
fraud.
now
the
relevance
becomes
very
important
because
the
defense
is
based
on
the
theory
that
this
creates
a
hardship
on
these
earlier
investors
and
i
can
only
suggest
this
as
the
natural
consequences
of
that
defense.
here
are
people
who
were
there
prior
to
1957
that
were
frozen
and
it’s
still
there
in
1959
when
the
management
of
the
association
started
in
on
a
program
of
defrauding
new
people
by
selling
new
securities
to
outsiders
without
telling
them
of
the
material
facts
which
should
have
been
disclosed
to
them
under
the
terms
of
the
1934
act.
now
what
material
terms
were
not
disclosed?
for
one
thing,
this
association
which
was
soliciting
investors
through
the
united
states
mail
sent
throughout
the
country
failed
to
disclose
to
these
new
people
that
in
representing
how
safe
this
association
was
as
they
did
that
they
failed
to
disclose
that
the
association
had
applied
for
federal
insurance
from
the
homeowners
--
from
the
federal
home
loan
bank
which
is
in
charge
of
the
fslic,
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation.
and
after
examination,
they
rejected
the
association
and
the
reasons
stated
for
the
rejection
were
the
unsafe
management
and
unsafe
financial
policies
of
the
association.
well
to
us,
it
is
quite
material
that
when
people
are
informed
that
this
is
a
safe
association,
we
believe
that
at
the
same
time
whether
they
wanted
to
tell
these
new
investors
or
not
that
in
representing
that
it
was
safe,
they
have
to
tell
them
that
that
was
--
had
been
held
we
believe
it’s
safe
but
the
government
thinks
it’s
not
and
they
won’t
give
us
any
insurance.
and
particularly
when
they
were
soliciting
people
had
their
money
and
insured
associations
to
withdraw
and
come
to
this
association
that
was
very
material
to
tell
them
that
they
have
been
rejected.
we
do
not
charge
that
there
was
a
fraud
by
--
that
they
told
anybody
they
were
insured
nor
do
we
charge
that
the
mere
non-statement
of
the
fact
that
they
were
uninsured
would
in
itself
possibly
have
created
a
fraud
or
possibly
it
might
have
under
the
circumstances
but
when
they
say
how
safe
they
are
then
i
think
that
they
became
incumbent
upon
them
to
tell
the
whole
story.
this
is
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
pardon
me?
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
not
at
least.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
withdrawal
remedy
that
they
talk
about
the
fact
they
say
that
we
have
the
right
to
withdraw,
number
one,
that
the
practical
remedy
was
nonexistence
because
since
1959
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
believe
that
under
the
state
act,
we
would
not
be
able
to
do.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
because
the
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
--
your
rights
are
limited
for
a
period
of
one
year
first
of
all.
secondly,
we
would
have
to
go
with
the
association
with
a
liquidation
and
we
would
not
be
able
to
proceed
in
the
state
without
proceeding
through
the
liquidation
proceeding.
as
far
as
any
remedy,
there
is
no
policy
restricting
the
federal
law
against
the
application.
the
section
78
cc
i
believe,
it
says
that
this
is
not
to
interfere
with
regulation
by
any
state
--
by
the
securities
department
of
any
state
but
except
to
the
extent
that
the
state
acts
are
inconsistent
with
the
federal
act
so
if
the
state
act
--
there
is
a
definite
policy
shown
for
a
dual
control.
the
state
security
laws
were
well
known
just
the
same
as
they
were
in
connection
with
the
1933
act.
this
is
mentioned
in
the
variable
annuities
case
that
there
are
state
acts.
the
variable
annuities
case
involved
a
specific
situation
where
they’re
running
up
against
the
mccarran-ferguson
situation.
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
was
enacted
in
1944
made
it
quite
patent
that
this
--
the
recent
cases
handed
down
here
by
this
court
and
was
not
to
be
interpreted
to
knock
out
the
paul
case
which
have
stood
for
90
years
as
pointed
out
in
the
decision
of
this
court.
so
that
there
is
a
dual
system
of
regulation
and
there
is
no
policy
as
there
is
in
the
insurance
companies
for
the
federal
government
not
to
go
into
areas
that
the
state
also
covers.
there’s
one
other
aspect
here
and
that
is
throughout
the
briefs
this
matter
of
regulation
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i’m
sorry.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
there
is
a
state
securities
act
and
the
securities
act
does
provide
remedies.
there
is
a
recession
remedy
that
was
exercised
within
six
months
after
knowledge.
the
difficulty
here
is
what
constitutes
knowledge.
everything
under
the
way
of
savings
and
loan
association
is
run
under
state
law.
no
access
maybe
hacked
to
a
shareholder,
to
the
books
and
records
of
the
company.
the
only
way
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
all
right,
the
city
savings
association
is
an
illinois
chartered
association.
it
is
a
corporation
under
illinois
law.
it
has
--
as
a
corporation
the
investors
are
shareholders
which
means
stockholders.
in
our
brief,
we
cited
the
bowman
case
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
gidwitz
case
also
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
defining
what
the
attributes
of
stocker
and
what
are
the
rights
of
stockholders.
our
opponents
say
these
cases
are
irrelevant
because
they
do
not
involve
savings
and
loan
association.
it
is
our
opinion
that
these
cases
are
relevant
because
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
in
defining
a
term
is
to
find
out
what
the
term
means
and
we
have
to
find
out
what
stock
is
and
stock
is
the
investor’s
interest
of
the
--
the
investor
who
takes
the
risk
of
the
success
of
the
enterprise
as
in
this
savings
of
loan
association
and
that’s
why
they
are
called
shareholders.
the
definition
in
the
act
provides
that
the
term
security
means
any
stock
among
other
things.
certificate
of
interest
or
participation
in
any
profit
sharing
agreement,
transferable
share,
investment
contract
or
in
general
any
instrument
commonly
known
as
the
security.
now
this
definition
of
security
is
about
as
carefully
drafted
definition
as
the
mind
conceive
see
because
the
terms
overlap
each
other
and
then
you
have
a
secondary
defense
theory
against
fraud.
you
have
encompassed
within
this
definition
of
security
and
other
phrase
which
is
a
catchall
which
is
called
or
in
general
any
instrument
commonly
known
as
a
security
so
that
if
anything
can
possibly
slip
through
stock
which
overlaps
with
share,
certainly
a
share
is
stock
and
if
the
share
is
transferable
as
every
share
is
and
every
stock
share
is
the
two
terms
are
certainly
to
some
extent
considerably
overlapping.
now
you
can
have
shares
and
something
which
is
not
stock
in
the
corporation.
you
can
have
shares
in
the
partnership
enterprise.
you
can
have
shares
on
the
trust.
there
are
many
situations
so
therefore
you
have
not
only
stock
which
overlaps
here
that
you
have
transferable
share
which
overlaps
investment
contract
because
every
share
of
stock
is
a
contract.
it
involves
the
state
statute
which
enables
the
corporation
to
exist.
it
involves
the
certificate,
what
is
in
the
certificate,
the
bylaws
of
the
company
and
all
of
these
things
go
together
to
setup
the
contract.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
they
are
not
traded
in
on
exchange.
they’re
traded
on
in
the
over-the-counter
market.
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
act
indicates
what
the
over-the-counter
market
is
although
the
preamble
to
the
act
says
that
this
act
is
for
the
protection
of
investors
and
for
other
purposes
and
relates
to
exchanges
and
over-the-counter
markets.
when
you
get
down
to
section
10(b)
which
was
the
operator
provision
that
we’re
suing
under
here,
they
don’t
use
the
term
over-the-counter
market
or
exchange.
section
10(b)
relates
to
any
transaction
in
any
security
by
any
person
on
any
exchange
or
not
on
any
exchange.
now
professor
loss
in
his
text
has
pointed
out
and
the
case
has
have
indicated
that
this
is
a
pretty
broad
statement
of
what
the
over-the-counter
market
is.
it
means
that
it
pertains
to
anything
--
the
over-the-counter
market
pertains
to
anything
that
is
not
on
in
exchange.
this
coverage
under
10(b)
is
as
broad
as
can
possibly
be
conceived.
it
covers
all
transactions
and
security
over
the
door
step.
there
are
many
transactions
where
there
had
been
securities
not
on
a
market
and
not
through
a
dealer
--
that
have
actually
been
between
one
person
and
another
where
the
remedy
has
been
supported
because
that’s
what
over-the-counter
market
means.
that
means
not
on
an
exchange.
have
i
answered
your
question
fully?
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
well
in
1934,
immediately
after
passage
of
the
act,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
was
asked
to
and
did
grant
an
exemption
to
trading
in
this
type
of
security
from
the
operation
of
the
1934
act.
it
was
a
limited
exemption
running
for
90
days
and
they
were
being
traded
i
believe
on
the
equivalence
stock
exchange
so
that
they
--
the
particular
exemption
that
they
wanted
there
was
from
registration
because
of
the
fact
that
these
were
clearly
securities.
so
as
far
as
trading
during
the
depression
days
and
during
the
days
whenever
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
right
now
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
well
for
seven
years,
city
savings
association
was
on
a
restricted
payout
phase
because
ever
since
they
got
into
trouble
back
in
1957
up
to
the
date
they
closed.
if
someone
who
was
an
investor
in
there
couldn’t
get
his
money
from
the
association
that
he
had
a
dying
relative
or
he
needed
surgery,
they
had
somebody
over
their
old
country
that
they
want
to
bring
over,
after
all
the
investors
in
these
savings
and
loan
association
involved
a
lot
of
little
people
who
put
$0.25
together
and
as
the
plan
shows,
they
save
up
a
$100.00
and
these
people
have
to
unload
their
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i’m
sorry.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
to
the
extent
is
that
anybody
who
has
a
share
who
dispose
--
who
wants
to
dispose
of
it
and
is
unable
to
get
his
money
from
the
savings
and
loan
association,
there’s
no
alternative
but
to
sell
it
over-the-counter.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
there
are
no
figures
on
that
but
it
is
done
necessarily
widely
in
city
savings
association.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
it
occurs
wherever
an
association
does
not
pay
out.
the
textbooks
--
this
gets
to
the
situation
of
the
savings
and
loan
association
which
i
was
going
to
go
into
anyway.
a
savings
and
loan
association
has
the
right
whenever
it
wants
to.
under
the
illinois
law,
there
is
no
mandatory
withdrawal
probation.
the
associate
--
the
individual
may
demand
withdrawal
of
their
shares
and
the
association
may
pay
him.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
association
has
to
pay.
after
the
--
if
the
association
decides
not
to
pay
for
the
reason
that
it
doesn’t
have
the
cash,
it
may
go
on
a
rotation
basis.
that
means
that
anybody
that
--
if
anybody
does
want
money,
they
have
to
get
in
line
and
everybody
gets
a
certain
amount
before
they
get
around
with
the
head
with
the
line
again.
now,
this
is
what
happened
in
city
savings
association
and
the
textbooks
on
savings
and
loan
associations
say
that
this
is
why
savings
and
loan
associations
are
better
than
banks
to
put
your
money
in
because
there
weren’t
so
many
failures
of
savings
and
loan
associations.
there
are
$38
billion
--
38
million
accounts
involving
$120
billion
i
believe
in
the
united
states
and
many
times
in
any
of
these
associations
goes
on
withdrawal
basis.
the
insurance
on
them
even
in
uninsured
association
does
not
become
effective
until
there
is
a
default
and
there
is
no
default
until
the
assets
of
the
association
are
less
than
the
total
of
creditors
claims
plus
the
claims
of
all
investors
so
that
at
any
time
that
investors
that
an
association
finds
that
its
investments
have
become
frozen.
if
you
get
into
an
adverse
position
as
occurs
from
time
to
time
where
they’ve
used
up
their
money
and
you
get
a
tight
money
market
and
there
isn’t
much
money
coming
in
and
the
money
is
out.
they
find
--
they
may
find
themselves
in
a
position
and
there
have
been
many,
many
instances
where
associations
have
had
to
go
on
withdrawal
basis
to
the
point
where
the
industry
uses
this
to
advertise
its
claims.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
yes
they
do.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
they
are
--
because
they
are
the
shareholders.
the
risk
of
the
investment
is
on
these
investors.
other
creditors
come
ahead
of
them.
they
--
and
when
i
say
other
creditors,
i
mean
the
general
creditors
because
these
people
are
not.
if
we
succeed
in
this
case,
our
people
would
be
declared
to
be
creditors
because
they
would
rescind.
now,
i
had
mentioned
one
of
the
elements
of
fraud,
one
of
the
other
elements
of
fraud
is
that
this
association
had
at
present
the
man
who
had
become
terribly
involved
in
many
situations.
one
of
them
was
the
united
states
government
was
claiming
money
from
him
because
they
charged
him
with
taking
taxes
because
they
said
he
was
taking
kickbacks
in
connection
with
the
associations
operations.
pardon
me,
this
goes
to
the
question
whether
or
not
there
was
a
fraud
involved.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
well,
we’ll
assume
that
there
was
a
material
fraud
shown
in
the
complaint.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
since
the
court
held,
there
was
no
cause
of
action
stated
and
the
--
one
of
the
respondents
has
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
state
the
cause
of
action
here
that’s
in
night
brief.
i
was
addressing
myself
to
that
but
if
the
board
wishes,
i’ll
pass
this
over.
as
far
as
--
we
then
are
getting
to
the
definition
of
security
as
set
forth
here.
we
have
asserted
that
we
do
hold
stock
in
a
corporation
which
is
clearly
within
the
act.
we
claim
that
we
have
certificate
of
interest
or
participation
in
a
profit
sharing
agreement,
investment
contract
and
a
transferable
share
which
brings
us
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
commonly
known
as
a
security
which
i
called
the
secondary
of
this
case.
they
--
in
examining
the
authorities
and
the
arguments
cited
by
the
respondents,
we
find
that
time
after
time
in
attempting
to
prove
that
this
is
not
stock
or
this
is
not
a
transferable
share
whatever
it
may
--
one
is
attempting
to
prove
in
particular
cases,
we
find
a
situation
developing
where
we
come
head
on
into
a
matter
of
commonly
known
us,
for
instance
professor
kerry
who
was
then
chairman
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
testified
in
1963
with
respect
to
the
1964
amendments.
he
was
asked
why
savings
and
loan
shares
were
exempted
from
the
additional
registration
probations
which
were
being
imposed
by
the
19
--
by
the
proposed
amendments.
his
answer
was
because
these
are
commonly
known
as
shares
and
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
provide
an
exemption
for
them.
the
testimony
and
the
report
in
1932
which
was
two
years
before
passage
of
this
act
in
connection
with
amendments
to
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
house
judiciary
committee
made
a
statement
that
they
were
not
taking
on
the
liquidation
of
savings
and
loan
association
through
bankruptcy
and
this
would
be
left
to
state
regulation
which
could
better
liquidate
them.
in
the
house
report
statement,
these
interests
are
referred
to
as
securities.
they
are
referred
to
as
securities
over
and
over
again
in
federal
sources,
in
state
sources,
there
are
at
least
five
acts
in
illinois
that
referred
to
in
these
securities
and
the
respondents
assert
that
since
the
illinois
legislature
went
to
pass
those
acts
was
not
referring
for
this
particular
federal
legislation.
therefore,
those
citations
to
the
illinois
acts
and
to
their
reference
to
these
as
securities
were
an
opposite.
however,
if
we
are
looking
to
see
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
security,
we
look
into
the
illinois
legislature,
we
look
into
the
legislative
action
of
the
states
throughout
the
country
and
we
find
wherever
we
go
and
in
the
testimony
of
the
representatives
of
the
savings
and
loan
industry
in
1933.
it
connects
with
the
passage
of
the
1933
act
which
contains
the
statute
of
the
same
definition
that
they
said
they
welcome
these
antifraud
provisions.
they
did
not
want
to
be
registered
but
they
welcome
the
antifraud
provisions
application
for
this
type
of
interest.
the
respondents
have
raised
the
point
that
in
connection
with
the
1933
act,
there
was
a
considerable
testimony
in
opposition
to
the
registration
of
these
securities.
they
also
state
that
there
was
opposition
to
their
inclusion
generally.
they
say
that
nothing
appears
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1934
act
to
indicate
whether
anything
in
connection
with
these
savings
and
loan
shares.
the
fact
remains
that
the
1933
hearings
did
encompass
all
of
the
objections
that
anybody
wanted
to
make
and
there
were
hearings
and
representations
by
those
who
favored
registration
and
those
who
oppose
registration.
what
was
the
net
result?
in
1933,
they
exempted
from
the
registration
provision
and
specifically
not
--
did
not
exempt
them
from
the
antifraud
provisions
in
‘33
act
only
those
savings
and
loan
associations
which
made
loans
to
their
members
and
which
did
not
charge
more
than
3%
for
the
privilege
of
withdrawal
so
that
the
net
result
of
all
the
controversy
about
what
happened
in
the
congressional
hearings
on
the
1933
act
adds
up
to
nothing
because
they
didn’t
get
the
exemptions
yet
respondents
would
argue
that
because
these
things
were
discussed,
therefore
congress
must
have
had
in
mind
in
1934
they
want
to
exclude
them.
but
if
we
look
at
the
1934
act,
we
find
that
there
are
some
very
significant
references
when
they
wanted
to
exclude
any
reference
or
any
supervision
over
insurance
company
securities,
the
congress
put
it
in
very
plainly
but
when
they
wanted
to
--
but
when
it
got
down
to
its
savings
and
loan
associations,
the
only
reference
to
exclusion
of
any
savings
and
loan
associations
as
the
exemption
paragraph
that
i've
just
mentioned
which
does
not
exclude
savings
and
loan
associations
generally.
if
we
look
at
the
cases
cited
against
the
background
of
that
definition
and
we
look
at
all
of
the
pertinent
laws
which
have
been
passed
not
only
in
illinois
but
are
represented
by
the
united
states
savings
and
loan
league
and
its
literature
which
we
have
cited
as
covering
states
throughout
the
country
where
they
have
referred
to
these
securities
--
where
they
advocate
these
as
investments.
we
come
to
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
this
is
the
type
of
investment
that
the
congress
was
talking
about
and
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
--
it
comes
from
little
people
who
put
in
very
small
sums
of
money
and
accumulate
them
over
lifetime
or
when
it
comes
--
where
the
money
is
invested
by
people
who
have
a
lot
of
money
and
invested
in
the
shares
of
large
companies.
the
concept
of
regulation
that
is
objected
to
by
the
respondents
here
is
a
different
kind
of
regulation
and
if
this
--
if
the
court
holds
here
as
has
generally
been
understood
to
be
the
law
throughout
the
years
that
these
are
securities
and
are
protected
by
the
antifraud
provisions,
this
does
not
mean
that
any
savings
and
loan
association
has
to
do
one
thing
as
far
as
registering
that
you
don’t
have
to
register,
they
need
to
do
nothing.
all
they
need
to
do
is
not
make
misrepresentations
to
the
people.
they
cannot
sell
these
securities
and
hold
back
vital
information
such
as
the
fact
that
they
are
in
serious
financial
trouble
with
their
other
investors
and
that
there
is
a
no
money
that
is
being
taken
in,
through
one
door
is
going
out
the
other
door
or
through
another
window
to
make
partial
payments
under
your
payout
plans
of
the
old
investors.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
broker
in
these
securities?
they
always
have
been
regulated
since
the
inception
of
this
act.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
those
who
specialize
--
there
are
specialists
who
specialize
in
this
type
of
security
and
contrary
to
the
statements
made
by
respondent
that
this
just
started
after
this
case
was
filed.
the
fact
remains
that
the
chicago
office
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
supervised
the
brokers
who
specialize
in
these
securities
all
the
way
back.
the
case
of
archer
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
it’s
an
interpretation.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
in
the
case
of
s.e.c.
versus
archer
which
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eight
circuit
in
the
name
of
archer
--
this
archer’s
appeal.
we
mentioned
that
in
our
briefs
and
i
believe
the
s.e.c.
does
also.
in
that
case,
mr.
archer
had
committed
various
manipulative
practices
with
regard
to
a
number
of
different
securities.
some
were
common
stocks,
some
were
certificates
of
pacific
savings
and
loan
associations.
we
made
specific
inquiry
as
we
stated
in
our
reply
to
the
briefs
and
opposition,
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
we
learned
that
these
were
withdrawable
certificates.
the
court
--
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
specifically
found
that
the
manipulative
practices
in
connection
with
these
particular
certificates
were
a
violation
of
the
1934
act
which
they
couldn’t
be
unless
they
were
considered
to
be
securities
within
the
1934
act
definition.
they
--
as
far
as
--
at
the
distinctive
characteristics,
the
argument
has
been
made
"oh,
well,
these
are
just
shares
in
name
alone.
they
are
not
really
shares
if
you
get
down
the
substance,
they’re
nothing
at
all.
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
support
that
kind
of
an
idea.
hence,
there
are
either
67
different
errors
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
where
you
have
upon
to
graciously
find
that
these
are
creditor-debtor
relationships.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
statute
all
say
these
are
not
debtor-creditor
relationships.
they
say
that
even
when
you
demand
the
withdrawal
of
your
money,
you
do
not
become
a
creditor
of
the
association
but
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
they
are
creditors.
in
one
place
they
find
that
they
are
depositors.
under
gordon
versus
hodgins
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
you
cannot
have
deposits
in
an
illinois
bank
because
that
connotes
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
which
is
prohibited
on
constitutional
grounds
in
illinois.
in
the
wisconsin
bankers
case
was
a
great
dispute
between
the
wisconsin
bankers
association
and
the
federal
home
loan
bank
in
connection
with
the
adoption
of
some
new
regulations.
that
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
there’s
a
very
strong
concurring
opinion
by
judge
burger
in
which
he
said,
what
difference
it
make
what
you
call
them
or
you
call
them
depositor
or
anything
else,
they
are
still
shareholders,
not
creditors,
and
that’s
exactly
what
they
are
here.
so
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
pardon
me?
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
would
think
not
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
shareholder
here
bares
the
investment
risk.
he
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
pile.
he
is
a
shareholder.
these
savings
and
loan
association
advertised
you
own
this
association.
you
own
the
assets.
you
have
our
wonderful
management
which
will
pick
wonderful
investments
and
do
your
business
for
you
and
so
on.
in
a
bank,
you
have
stockholders
beneath
the
depositors
and
therefore
you
have
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
there,
while
here
you
have
the
shareholder.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
in
a
bank
savings
account.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
here,
we
only
get
dividends
if
they’re
earned.
my
time
is
up
for
this
part
of
the
argument.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
would
like
to
respond
to
appeal
of
the
unanswered
questions
and
with
regard
to
the
regulations
that
mr.
perlman
is
speaking
of
now.
first
of
all,
i
see
no
policy,
federal
or
state
which
should
borrow
a
man
who
has
been
defrauded
of
his
money
assuming
he
has
been
getting
it
back
again.
there
is
no
reason
why
a
shareholder
of
a
corporation
which
has
received
moneys
through
federal
officers
should
have
some
equity
suddenly
come
up
out
of
nowhere
so
that
he
is
entitled
to
participate
in
his
wrongfully
secured
funds.
that’s
my
first
point.
the
second
thing
is
that
one
of
the
reasons
our
federal
remedy
is
a
better
one
taking
it
in
this
particular
cases
that
we
have
the
string
of
cases
going
back
for
a
hundred
years.
we
have
case
versus
los
angeles,
lumber
company,
the
northern
pacific
against
boyd
that
we
remember
from
the
reorganization
days
and
those
cases
held
that
there
is
a
rule
of
absolute
priorities
in
equity
that
you
just
don’t
sit
down
and
do
curbstone
equity
and
let
people
just
keep
money
or
reshuffle
the
rights
and
put
shareholder
ahead
of
creditors
or
whatever
may
be
sought.
now
with
regard
to
the
type
of
regulation
that
we
have
in
illinois
that
the
attorney
general’s
office
has
been
speaking
of,
he
says
that
they
can’t
buy
--
they
can’t
invest
any
other
money.
justice
stewart
asked
whether
they
are
limited
to
investments
and
homes
i
believe.
the
answer
is,
if
we’re
going
to
take
what
happened
here,
if
we
look
at
page
10
of
the
brief,
we
find
that
they
invested
a
million
dollars
in
a
golf
course,
806,000
in
two
golf
courses.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
well,
this
is
--
but
the
answer
is
--
the
answer
he
gave
was
wrong,
it’s
the
reverse
of
the
fact.
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
we
have
the
detailed
facts
that
justice
fortas
was
asking
about.
he
said,
what
are
the
rights
of
shareholders,
what
are
the
specific,
simple
little
things
here.
here
they
are
at
the
top
page
11.
under
certain
conditions,
management
can
invest
more
than
45%
of
the
association’s
total
assets
as
follows;
45%
certain
marketable
investment
securities,
15%
at
section
792.8,
initial
purchase
and
development
of
residential
property
is
10%,
792.7
direct
general
obligations
and
certain
political
subdivisions.
obligations
of
urban
renewal
investment
corporations,
other
investments,
these
are
minimal
standards
and
they’re
so
broad
that
they
can
do
almost
anything
and
the
result
is
that
they
can
get
into
all
of
these
sort
of
things
for
periods
of
years
and
lend
and
renew
$65
million
indicating
the
total
number
or
renewals
here
without
any
interference
by
the
state.
now
as
far
as
the
attitude
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
the
answer
is
that
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
does
approve
of
this
idea
that
these
are
violations
of
the
‘34
act.
and
the
proof
of
that
is
that
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
sent
out
a
letter
to
every
savings
and
loan
insured
association
this
country
suggesting
to
them
that
they
better
check
their
advertising
about
a
year
ago
because
they
were
advertising
that
they
were
paying
five
and
three
quarter
percent
on
their
accounts
and
they
really
weren’t.
the
five
and
three
quarter
percent
was
what
the
result
was
as
the
result
of
the
accumulative
interest
in
the
last
quarter
so
that
as
to
all
periods
prior
to
that,
they
were
in
violation.
well,
if
they
didn’t
believe
that
the
act
applied,
they
wouldn’t
have
written
a
letter.
as
far
as
the
question
of
justice
fortas
as
to
where
in
these
briefs
does
it
set
out
the
details
as
to
what
the
rights,
privileges
and
so
forth
of
an
investor
are,
there
are
five
pages
of
it.
section
by
section,
we
recite
them
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioners
and
we
give
the
section
references
point
after
point
which
has
been
completely
ignored
here
and
anyone
who
wants
to
read
it
can
find
out
exactly
what
you
have
voting
rights.
you
cannot
give
irrevocable
proxies.
it
is
not
true
that
these
proxies
are
any
different.
the
section
and
proxies
is
identical
to
the
section
and
proxies
for
a
general
business
corporation
in
the
state
of
illinois.
it’s
word
for
word
the
same.
now
the
fact
that
a
shareholder
in
inland
steel
or
any
other
corporation
doesn’t
choose
to
vote,
they
just
sends
that
into
management
year
after
year
because
he
has
confidence
in
management,
doesn’t
take
away
one
with
from
the
nature
of
the
security
or
the
nature
of
his
investment.
as
far
as
this
question
that
was
asked
about
the
brokers
under
the
--
what
would
happen
about
the
brokers,
why
do
brokers
register.
the
answer
of
the
attorney
general
was
that,
well,
they
could
be
reached
through
the
1933
act
but
if
we
hold
that
these
are
not
securities,
if
these
are
not
securities,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
white
who
asked
that
question,
they
--
the
s.e.c.
could
not
reach
them
under
the
‘33
act.
if
they’re
not
securities,
it’s
been
said
that
they’re
not
securities
under
the
‘33
act
or
under
the
‘34
act.
now
the
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
not
one
i
ought
to.
the
statement
was
made
that
this
is
a
class
action
brought
on
behalf
of
shareholders.
i
think
that
was
justice
stewart’s
question.
it
this
a
class
action
brought
on
behalf
of
all
the
shareholders.
the
answer
is
it
is
not.
this
is
an
action
by
the
liquidators
of
the
corporation
who
are
suing
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
shareholders.
they
have
taken
the
position.
they
are
not
going
to
allow
us
to
recover
the
moneys
and
assuming
we
win
of
which
we
claim
we
were
defrauded.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
say
that
the
liquidators
have
brought
an
action
there's
these
people
who
claim
to
be
lawful
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
that’s
the
state
chancery
action.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
us.
if
they
win
there,
they
will
still
oppose
us
getting
our
money
here
assuming
we’re
right.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
that
is
what
they
say
they
want.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
that
is
correct.
our
position
is
that
if
this
money,
100%
of
it
came
out
of
our
pockets
to
the
tune
of
$18
million
which
is
i
believe
the
amount
that
was
received
from
this
post
1959
people
that
no
part
of
the
money
that
came
from
our
pocket
should
go
to
the
shareholders
who
were
shareholders
prior
to
that
time
regardless
of
the
fact
that
they
may
have
had
suffered
and
their
coffers
may
have
been
empty
and
they
were
in
serious
trouble
because
of
the
actions
of
their
board
directors.
they
are
not
entitled
to
receive
our
money
no
differently
than
in
any
other
corporate
or
individual
situation.
we
are
not
on
a
par
with
them.
as
far
as
what
the
usual
interest
is,
justice
fortas
asked
about
that
i
believe
in
the
mensik
reply
brief,
they
put
in
a
picture
of
one
of
the
letters
and
the
letters
shows
on
the
right
is
exhibit
3a
or
appendix
3a.
it
says,
4%
on
prepaid
savings
--
on
prepaid
savings
share
certificates.
now
the
suggestion
was
made
that
the
association
may
issue
a
certificate
or
may
issue
a
savings
account
book.
the
illinois
act
makes
it
mandatory
that
he
insert
certificate
evidence
every
share
interest.
there
is
no
option
as
far
as
the
right
to
issue
that
the
association
can
hold
that
once
that
has
been
prepared
and
executed
and
can
issue
an
account
book
to
show
what
the
situation
is
in
this
person’s
own
--
each
person
own
so
many
shares.
the
--
as
far
as
the
--
i’m
sorry.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i’m
looking
at
my
papers
and
not
at
the
light.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
in
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
definition
of
security
in
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
in
connection
with
this
argument
that
as
i
state
the
facts
of
the
case
that
the
court
bare
in
mind
the
decisions,
many
of
which
are
of
recent
years
of
this
court
dealing
on
what
are
securities
and
what
the
purpose
of
the
1933
securities
act
and
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
is
although
the
direct
decision
of
this
court
on
the
1934
act
was
on
the
recent
case
of
surowitz
versus
hilton
hotels
corporation
and
this
court
set
out
a
strong
statement
of
the
fact
that
the
primary
aim
and
purpose
of
the
1934
act
as
well
as
the
1933
act
is
the
protection
of
the
general
public
and
investors
including
the
uninformed,
the
gullible,
the
ignorant
and
the
little
investors.
judge
cummings
dissented
on
the
opinion
--
majority
opinion
of
the
court
in
our
matter
and
his
opinion
sets
forth
the
aims
and
purposes
of
the
1934
act
and
that
they
are
served
by
the
application
of
that
act
to
the
typical
savings
and
loan
accounts
holder
who
was
a
small
investor
who
was
just
as
unwary
and
in
need
of
protection
of
the
typical
and
sophisticated
holder
of
corporate
stock.
now
the
other
cases
pertaining
to
the
1933
act
that
i
think
are
particularly
important
here
are
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
versus
w.j.
howey,
1946.
c.m.
joiner,
s.e.c.
versus
joiner
1943,
the
variable
annuities
case
which
involved
the
main
opinion
or
the
concurring
opinion
and
dissenting
opinion,
1959,
the
united
benefit
insurance
company,
lawyers
term
of
court
--
and
the
capital
gains
research
case
which
involves
another
section
of
the
act
but
still
dealt
with
the
overall
purpose.
this
action
was
brought
pursuant
to
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
act
and
rule
10(b)(5)
promulgated
there
under.
the
respondents
here
and
the
defendants
below
are
the
city
savings
association
which
is
an
insolvent
savings
to
loan
association
which
has
closed
its
doors
and
is
now
in
the
process
of
liquidations.
its
officers
and
directors,
the
liquidators
or
purported
liquidators
and
certain
officials
of
the
state
of
illinois
who
had
seized
custody
of
the
association
at
the
time
the
complaint
herein
was
filed.
the
petitioners
are
about
150
investors
in
the
capital
shares
of
city
savings
association
pursuing
on
their
own
behalf
and
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
over
5,000
investors
who
purchased
their
shares
after
july
24,
1959
and
prior
to
the
closing
on
june
26,
1964
just
short
of
five
years.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
only
relevance
of
the
date
is
that
all
of
the
investors
who
were
there
prior
to
july
24,
1959
were
investors
prior
to
1957
because
in
1957,
the
association
had
been
closed
by
the
state
of
illinois
and
then
reopened.
the
accounts
were
frozen
and
the
people
couldn’t
withdraw.
so
these
people
were
in
the
plate
that
they’re
still
in
except
for
the
fact
that
they’ve
been
able
to
realize
some
recovery
of
their
interest
out
of
the
new
moneys
which
we
claim
were
received
from
our
clients
in
the
class
we
represent,
through
misrepresentation
and
fraud.
now
the
relevance
becomes
very
important
because
the
defense
is
based
on
the
theory
that
this
creates
a
hardship
on
these
earlier
investors
and
i
can
only
suggest
this
as
the
natural
consequences
of
that
defense.
here
are
people
who
were
there
prior
to
1957
that
were
frozen
and
it’s
still
there
in
1959
when
the
management
of
the
association
started
in
on
a
program
of
defrauding
new
people
by
selling
new
securities
to
outsiders
without
telling
them
of
the
material
facts
which
should
have
been
disclosed
to
them
under
the
terms
of
the
1934
act.
now
what
material
terms
were
not
disclosed?
for
one
thing,
this
association
which
was
soliciting
investors
through
the
united
states
mail
sent
throughout
the
country
failed
to
disclose
to
these
new
people
that
in
representing
how
safe
this
association
was
as
they
did
that
they
failed
to
disclose
that
the
association
had
applied
for
federal
insurance
from
the
homeowners
--
from
the
federal
home
loan
bank
which
is
in
charge
of
the
fslic,
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation.
and
after
examination,
they
rejected
the
association
and
the
reasons
stated
for
the
rejection
were
the
unsafe
management
and
unsafe
financial
policies
of
the
association.
well
to
us,
it
is
quite
material
that
when
people
are
informed
that
this
is
a
safe
association,
we
believe
that
at
the
same
time
whether
they
wanted
to
tell
these
new
investors
or
not
that
in
representing
that
it
was
safe,
they
have
to
tell
them
that
that
was
--
had
been
held
we
believe
it’s
safe
but
the
government
thinks
it’s
not
and
they
won’t
give
us
any
insurance.
and
particularly
when
they
were
soliciting
people
had
their
money
and
insured
associations
to
withdraw
and
come
to
this
association
that
was
very
material
to
tell
them
that
they
have
been
rejected.
we
do
not
charge
that
there
was
a
fraud
by
--
that
they
told
anybody
they
were
insured
nor
do
we
charge
that
the
mere
non-statement
of
the
fact
that
they
were
uninsured
would
in
itself
possibly
have
created
a
fraud
or
possibly
it
might
have
under
the
circumstances
but
when
they
say
how
safe
they
are
then
i
think
that
they
became
incumbent
upon
them
to
tell
the
whole
story.
this
is
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
pardon
me?
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
not
at
least.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
withdrawal
remedy
that
they
talk
about
the
fact
they
say
that
we
have
the
right
to
withdraw,
number
one,
that
the
practical
remedy
was
nonexistence
because
since
1959
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
believe
that
under
the
state
act,
we
would
not
be
able
to
do.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
because
the
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
--
your
rights
are
limited
for
a
period
of
one
year
first
of
all.
secondly,
we
would
have
to
go
with
the
association
with
a
liquidation
and
we
would
not
be
able
to
proceed
in
the
state
without
proceeding
through
the
liquidation
proceeding.
as
far
as
any
remedy,
there
is
no
policy
restricting
the
federal
law
against
the
application.
the
section
78
cc
i
believe,
it
says
that
this
is
not
to
interfere
with
regulation
by
any
state
--
by
the
securities
department
of
any
state
but
except
to
the
extent
that
the
state
acts
are
inconsistent
with
the
federal
act
so
if
the
state
act
--
there
is
a
definite
policy
shown
for
a
dual
control.
the
state
security
laws
were
well
known
just
the
same
as
they
were
in
connection
with
the
1933
act.
this
is
mentioned
in
the
variable
annuities
case
that
there
are
state
acts.
the
variable
annuities
case
involved
a
specific
situation
where
they’re
running
up
against
the
mccarran-ferguson
situation.
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
was
enacted
in
1944
made
it
quite
patent
that
this
--
the
recent
cases
handed
down
here
by
this
court
and
was
not
to
be
interpreted
to
knock
out
the
paul
case
which
have
stood
for
90
years
as
pointed
out
in
the
decision
of
this
court.
so
that
there
is
a
dual
system
of
regulation
and
there
is
no
policy
as
there
is
in
the
insurance
companies
for
the
federal
government
not
to
go
into
areas
that
the
state
also
covers.
there’s
one
other
aspect
here
and
that
is
throughout
the
briefs
this
matter
of
regulation
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i’m
sorry.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
there
is
a
state
securities
act
and
the
securities
act
does
provide
remedies.
there
is
a
recession
remedy
that
was
exercised
within
six
months
after
knowledge.
the
difficulty
here
is
what
constitutes
knowledge.
everything
under
the
way
of
savings
and
loan
association
is
run
under
state
law.
no
access
maybe
hacked
to
a
shareholder,
to
the
books
and
records
of
the
company.
the
only
way
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
all
right,
the
city
savings
association
is
an
illinois
chartered
association.
it
is
a
corporation
under
illinois
law.
it
has
--
as
a
corporation
the
investors
are
shareholders
which
means
stockholders.
in
our
brief,
we
cited
the
bowman
case
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
gidwitz
case
also
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
defining
what
the
attributes
of
stocker
and
what
are
the
rights
of
stockholders.
our
opponents
say
these
cases
are
irrelevant
because
they
do
not
involve
savings
and
loan
association.
it
is
our
opinion
that
these
cases
are
relevant
because
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
in
defining
a
term
is
to
find
out
what
the
term
means
and
we
have
to
find
out
what
stock
is
and
stock
is
the
investor’s
interest
of
the
--
the
investor
who
takes
the
risk
of
the
success
of
the
enterprise
as
in
this
savings
of
loan
association
and
that’s
why
they
are
called
shareholders.
the
definition
in
the
act
provides
that
the
term
security
means
any
stock
among
other
things.
certificate
of
interest
or
participation
in
any
profit
sharing
agreement,
transferable
share,
investment
contract
or
in
general
any
instrument
commonly
known
as
the
security.
now
this
definition
of
security
is
about
as
carefully
drafted
definition
as
the
mind
conceive
see
because
the
terms
overlap
each
other
and
then
you
have
a
secondary
defense
theory
against
fraud.
you
have
encompassed
within
this
definition
of
security
and
other
phrase
which
is
a
catchall
which
is
called
or
in
general
any
instrument
commonly
known
as
a
security
so
that
if
anything
can
possibly
slip
through
stock
which
overlaps
with
share,
certainly
a
share
is
stock
and
if
the
share
is
transferable
as
every
share
is
and
every
stock
share
is
the
two
terms
are
certainly
to
some
extent
considerably
overlapping.
now
you
can
have
shares
and
something
which
is
not
stock
in
the
corporation.
you
can
have
shares
in
the
partnership
enterprise.
you
can
have
shares
on
the
trust.
there
are
many
situations
so
therefore
you
have
not
only
stock
which
overlaps
here
that
you
have
transferable
share
which
overlaps
investment
contract
because
every
share
of
stock
is
a
contract.
it
involves
the
state
statute
which
enables
the
corporation
to
exist.
it
involves
the
certificate,
what
is
in
the
certificate,
the
bylaws
of
the
company
and
all
of
these
things
go
together
to
setup
the
contract.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
they
are
not
traded
in
on
exchange.
they’re
traded
on
in
the
over-the-counter
market.
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
act
indicates
what
the
over-the-counter
market
is
although
the
preamble
to
the
act
says
that
this
act
is
for
the
protection
of
investors
and
for
other
purposes
and
relates
to
exchanges
and
over-the-counter
markets.
when
you
get
down
to
section
10(b)
which
was
the
operator
provision
that
we’re
suing
under
here,
they
don’t
use
the
term
over-the-counter
market
or
exchange.
section
10(b)
relates
to
any
transaction
in
any
security
by
any
person
on
any
exchange
or
not
on
any
exchange.
now
professor
loss
in
his
text
has
pointed
out
and
the
case
has
have
indicated
that
this
is
a
pretty
broad
statement
of
what
the
over-the-counter
market
is.
it
means
that
it
pertains
to
anything
--
the
over-the-counter
market
pertains
to
anything
that
is
not
on
in
exchange.
this
coverage
under
10(b)
is
as
broad
as
can
possibly
be
conceived.
it
covers
all
transactions
and
security
over
the
door
step.
there
are
many
transactions
where
there
had
been
securities
not
on
a
market
and
not
through
a
dealer
--
that
have
actually
been
between
one
person
and
another
where
the
remedy
has
been
supported
because
that’s
what
over-the-counter
market
means.
that
means
not
on
an
exchange.
have
i
answered
your
question
fully?
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
well
in
1934,
immediately
after
passage
of
the
act,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
was
asked
to
and
did
grant
an
exemption
to
trading
in
this
type
of
security
from
the
operation
of
the
1934
act.
it
was
a
limited
exemption
running
for
90
days
and
they
were
being
traded
i
believe
on
the
equivalence
stock
exchange
so
that
they
--
the
particular
exemption
that
they
wanted
there
was
from
registration
because
of
the
fact
that
these
were
clearly
securities.
so
as
far
as
trading
during
the
depression
days
and
during
the
days
whenever
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
right
now
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
well
for
seven
years,
city
savings
association
was
on
a
restricted
payout
phase
because
ever
since
they
got
into
trouble
back
in
1957
up
to
the
date
they
closed.
if
someone
who
was
an
investor
in
there
couldn’t
get
his
money
from
the
association
that
he
had
a
dying
relative
or
he
needed
surgery,
they
had
somebody
over
their
old
country
that
they
want
to
bring
over,
after
all
the
investors
in
these
savings
and
loan
association
involved
a
lot
of
little
people
who
put
$0.25
together
and
as
the
plan
shows,
they
save
up
a
$100.00
and
these
people
have
to
unload
their
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i’m
sorry.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
to
the
extent
is
that
anybody
who
has
a
share
who
dispose
--
who
wants
to
dispose
of
it
and
is
unable
to
get
his
money
from
the
savings
and
loan
association,
there’s
no
alternative
but
to
sell
it
over-the-counter.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
there
are
no
figures
on
that
but
it
is
done
necessarily
widely
in
city
savings
association.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
it
occurs
wherever
an
association
does
not
pay
out.
the
textbooks
--
this
gets
to
the
situation
of
the
savings
and
loan
association
which
i
was
going
to
go
into
anyway.
a
savings
and
loan
association
has
the
right
whenever
it
wants
to.
under
the
illinois
law,
there
is
no
mandatory
withdrawal
probation.
the
associate
--
the
individual
may
demand
withdrawal
of
their
shares
and
the
association
may
pay
him.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
association
has
to
pay.
after
the
--
if
the
association
decides
not
to
pay
for
the
reason
that
it
doesn’t
have
the
cash,
it
may
go
on
a
rotation
basis.
that
means
that
anybody
that
--
if
anybody
does
want
money,
they
have
to
get
in
line
and
everybody
gets
a
certain
amount
before
they
get
around
with
the
head
with
the
line
again.
now,
this
is
what
happened
in
city
savings
association
and
the
textbooks
on
savings
and
loan
associations
say
that
this
is
why
savings
and
loan
associations
are
better
than
banks
to
put
your
money
in
because
there
weren’t
so
many
failures
of
savings
and
loan
associations.
there
are
$38
billion
--
38
million
accounts
involving
$120
billion
i
believe
in
the
united
states
and
many
times
in
any
of
these
associations
goes
on
withdrawal
basis.
the
insurance
on
them
even
in
uninsured
association
does
not
become
effective
until
there
is
a
default
and
there
is
no
default
until
the
assets
of
the
association
are
less
than
the
total
of
creditors
claims
plus
the
claims
of
all
investors
so
that
at
any
time
that
investors
that
an
association
finds
that
its
investments
have
become
frozen.
if
you
get
into
an
adverse
position
as
occurs
from
time
to
time
where
they’ve
used
up
their
money
and
you
get
a
tight
money
market
and
there
isn’t
much
money
coming
in
and
the
money
is
out.
they
find
--
they
may
find
themselves
in
a
position
and
there
have
been
many,
many
instances
where
associations
have
had
to
go
on
withdrawal
basis
to
the
point
where
the
industry
uses
this
to
advertise
its
claims.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
yes
they
do.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
they
are
--
because
they
are
the
shareholders.
the
risk
of
the
investment
is
on
these
investors.
other
creditors
come
ahead
of
them.
they
--
and
when
i
say
other
creditors,
i
mean
the
general
creditors
because
these
people
are
not.
if
we
succeed
in
this
case,
our
people
would
be
declared
to
be
creditors
because
they
would
rescind.
now,
i
had
mentioned
one
of
the
elements
of
fraud,
one
of
the
other
elements
of
fraud
is
that
this
association
had
at
present
the
man
who
had
become
terribly
involved
in
many
situations.
one
of
them
was
the
united
states
government
was
claiming
money
from
him
because
they
charged
him
with
taking
taxes
because
they
said
he
was
taking
kickbacks
in
connection
with
the
associations
operations.
pardon
me,
this
goes
to
the
question
whether
or
not
there
was
a
fraud
involved.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
well,
we’ll
assume
that
there
was
a
material
fraud
shown
in
the
complaint.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
since
the
court
held,
there
was
no
cause
of
action
stated
and
the
--
one
of
the
respondents
has
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
state
the
cause
of
action
here
that’s
in
night
brief.
i
was
addressing
myself
to
that
but
if
the
board
wishes,
i’ll
pass
this
over.
as
far
as
--
we
then
are
getting
to
the
definition
of
security
as
set
forth
here.
we
have
asserted
that
we
do
hold
stock
in
a
corporation
which
is
clearly
within
the
act.
we
claim
that
we
have
certificate
of
interest
or
participation
in
a
profit
sharing
agreement,
investment
contract
and
a
transferable
share
which
brings
us
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
commonly
known
as
a
security
which
i
called
the
secondary
of
this
case.
they
--
in
examining
the
authorities
and
the
arguments
cited
by
the
respondents,
we
find
that
time
after
time
in
attempting
to
prove
that
this
is
not
stock
or
this
is
not
a
transferable
share
whatever
it
may
--
one
is
attempting
to
prove
in
particular
cases,
we
find
a
situation
developing
where
we
come
head
on
into
a
matter
of
commonly
known
us,
for
instance
professor
kerry
who
was
then
chairman
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
testified
in
1963
with
respect
to
the
1964
amendments.
he
was
asked
why
savings
and
loan
shares
were
exempted
from
the
additional
registration
probations
which
were
being
imposed
by
the
19
--
by
the
proposed
amendments.
his
answer
was
because
these
are
commonly
known
as
shares
and
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
provide
an
exemption
for
them.
the
testimony
and
the
report
in
1932
which
was
two
years
before
passage
of
this
act
in
connection
with
amendments
to
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
house
judiciary
committee
made
a
statement
that
they
were
not
taking
on
the
liquidation
of
savings
and
loan
association
through
bankruptcy
and
this
would
be
left
to
state
regulation
which
could
better
liquidate
them.
in
the
house
report
statement,
these
interests
are
referred
to
as
securities.
they
are
referred
to
as
securities
over
and
over
again
in
federal
sources,
in
state
sources,
there
are
at
least
five
acts
in
illinois
that
referred
to
in
these
securities
and
the
respondents
assert
that
since
the
illinois
legislature
went
to
pass
those
acts
was
not
referring
for
this
particular
federal
legislation.
therefore,
those
citations
to
the
illinois
acts
and
to
their
reference
to
these
as
securities
were
an
opposite.
however,
if
we
are
looking
to
see
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
security,
we
look
into
the
illinois
legislature,
we
look
into
the
legislative
action
of
the
states
throughout
the
country
and
we
find
wherever
we
go
and
in
the
testimony
of
the
representatives
of
the
savings
and
loan
industry
in
1933.
it
connects
with
the
passage
of
the
1933
act
which
contains
the
statute
of
the
same
definition
that
they
said
they
welcome
these
antifraud
provisions.
they
did
not
want
to
be
registered
but
they
welcome
the
antifraud
provisions
application
for
this
type
of
interest.
the
respondents
have
raised
the
point
that
in
connection
with
the
1933
act,
there
was
a
considerable
testimony
in
opposition
to
the
registration
of
these
securities.
they
also
state
that
there
was
opposition
to
their
inclusion
generally.
they
say
that
nothing
appears
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1934
act
to
indicate
whether
anything
in
connection
with
these
savings
and
loan
shares.
the
fact
remains
that
the
1933
hearings
did
encompass
all
of
the
objections
that
anybody
wanted
to
make
and
there
were
hearings
and
representations
by
those
who
favored
registration
and
those
who
oppose
registration.
what
was
the
net
result?
in
1933,
they
exempted
from
the
registration
provision
and
specifically
not
--
did
not
exempt
them
from
the
antifraud
provisions
in
‘33
act
only
those
savings
and
loan
associations
which
made
loans
to
their
members
and
which
did
not
charge
more
than
3%
for
the
privilege
of
withdrawal
so
that
the
net
result
of
all
the
controversy
about
what
happened
in
the
congressional
hearings
on
the
1933
act
adds
up
to
nothing
because
they
didn’t
get
the
exemptions
yet
respondents
would
argue
that
because
these
things
were
discussed,
therefore
congress
must
have
had
in
mind
in
1934
they
want
to
exclude
them.
but
if
we
look
at
the
1934
act,
we
find
that
there
are
some
very
significant
references
when
they
wanted
to
exclude
any
reference
or
any
supervision
over
insurance
company
securities,
the
congress
put
it
in
very
plainly
but
when
they
wanted
to
--
but
when
it
got
down
to
its
savings
and
loan
associations,
the
only
reference
to
exclusion
of
any
savings
and
loan
associations
as
the
exemption
paragraph
that
i've
just
mentioned
which
does
not
exclude
savings
and
loan
associations
generally.
if
we
look
at
the
cases
cited
against
the
background
of
that
definition
and
we
look
at
all
of
the
pertinent
laws
which
have
been
passed
not
only
in
illinois
but
are
represented
by
the
united
states
savings
and
loan
league
and
its
literature
which
we
have
cited
as
covering
states
throughout
the
country
where
they
have
referred
to
these
securities
--
where
they
advocate
these
as
investments.
we
come
to
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
this
is
the
type
of
investment
that
the
congress
was
talking
about
and
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
--
it
comes
from
little
people
who
put
in
very
small
sums
of
money
and
accumulate
them
over
lifetime
or
when
it
comes
--
where
the
money
is
invested
by
people
who
have
a
lot
of
money
and
invested
in
the
shares
of
large
companies.
the
concept
of
regulation
that
is
objected
to
by
the
respondents
here
is
a
different
kind
of
regulation
and
if
this
--
if
the
court
holds
here
as
has
generally
been
understood
to
be
the
law
throughout
the
years
that
these
are
securities
and
are
protected
by
the
antifraud
provisions,
this
does
not
mean
that
any
savings
and
loan
association
has
to
do
one
thing
as
far
as
registering
that
you
don’t
have
to
register,
they
need
to
do
nothing.
all
they
need
to
do
is
not
make
misrepresentations
to
the
people.
they
cannot
sell
these
securities
and
hold
back
vital
information
such
as
the
fact
that
they
are
in
serious
financial
trouble
with
their
other
investors
and
that
there
is
a
no
money
that
is
being
taken
in,
through
one
door
is
going
out
the
other
door
or
through
another
window
to
make
partial
payments
under
your
payout
plans
of
the
old
investors.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
broker
in
these
securities?
they
always
have
been
regulated
since
the
inception
of
this
act.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
those
who
specialize
--
there
are
specialists
who
specialize
in
this
type
of
security
and
contrary
to
the
statements
made
by
respondent
that
this
just
started
after
this
case
was
filed.
the
fact
remains
that
the
chicago
office
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
supervised
the
brokers
who
specialize
in
these
securities
all
the
way
back.
the
case
of
archer
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
it’s
an
interpretation.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
in
the
case
of
s.e.c.
versus
archer
which
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eight
circuit
in
the
name
of
archer
--
this
archer’s
appeal.
we
mentioned
that
in
our
briefs
and
i
believe
the
s.e.c.
does
also.
in
that
case,
mr.
archer
had
committed
various
manipulative
practices
with
regard
to
a
number
of
different
securities.
some
were
common
stocks,
some
were
certificates
of
pacific
savings
and
loan
associations.
we
made
specific
inquiry
as
we
stated
in
our
reply
to
the
briefs
and
opposition,
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
we
learned
that
these
were
withdrawable
certificates.
the
court
--
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
specifically
found
that
the
manipulative
practices
in
connection
with
these
particular
certificates
were
a
violation
of
the
1934
act
which
they
couldn’t
be
unless
they
were
considered
to
be
securities
within
the
1934
act
definition.
they
--
as
far
as
--
at
the
distinctive
characteristics,
the
argument
has
been
made
"oh,
well,
these
are
just
shares
in
name
alone.
they
are
not
really
shares
if
you
get
down
the
substance,
they’re
nothing
at
all.
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
support
that
kind
of
an
idea.
hence,
there
are
either
67
different
errors
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
where
you
have
upon
to
graciously
find
that
these
are
creditor-debtor
relationships.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
statute
all
say
these
are
not
debtor-creditor
relationships.
they
say
that
even
when
you
demand
the
withdrawal
of
your
money,
you
do
not
become
a
creditor
of
the
association
but
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
they
are
creditors.
in
one
place
they
find
that
they
are
depositors.
under
gordon
versus
hodgins
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
you
cannot
have
deposits
in
an
illinois
bank
because
that
connotes
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
which
is
prohibited
on
constitutional
grounds
in
illinois.
in
the
wisconsin
bankers
case
was
a
great
dispute
between
the
wisconsin
bankers
association
and
the
federal
home
loan
bank
in
connection
with
the
adoption
of
some
new
regulations.
that
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
there’s
a
very
strong
concurring
opinion
by
judge
burger
in
which
he
said,
what
difference
it
make
what
you
call
them
or
you
call
them
depositor
or
anything
else,
they
are
still
shareholders,
not
creditors,
and
that’s
exactly
what
they
are
here.
so
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
pardon
me?
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
would
think
not
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
shareholder
here
bares
the
investment
risk.
he
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
pile.
he
is
a
shareholder.
these
savings
and
loan
association
advertised
you
own
this
association.
you
own
the
assets.
you
have
our
wonderful
management
which
will
pick
wonderful
investments
and
do
your
business
for
you
and
so
on.
in
a
bank,
you
have
stockholders
beneath
the
depositors
and
therefore
you
have
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
there,
while
here
you
have
the
shareholder.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
in
a
bank
savings
account.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
here,
we
only
get
dividends
if
they’re
earned.
my
time
is
up
for
this
part
of
the
argument.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
would
like
to
respond
to
appeal
of
the
unanswered
questions
and
with
regard
to
the
regulations
that
mr.
perlman
is
speaking
of
now.
first
of
all,
i
see
no
policy,
federal
or
state
which
should
borrow
a
man
who
has
been
defrauded
of
his
money
assuming
he
has
been
getting
it
back
again.
there
is
no
reason
why
a
shareholder
of
a
corporation
which
has
received
moneys
through
federal
officers
should
have
some
equity
suddenly
come
up
out
of
nowhere
so
that
he
is
entitled
to
participate
in
his
wrongfully
secured
funds.
that’s
my
first
point.
the
second
thing
is
that
one
of
the
reasons
our
federal
remedy
is
a
better
one
taking
it
in
this
particular
cases
that
we
have
the
string
of
cases
going
back
for
a
hundred
years.
we
have
case
versus
los
angeles,
lumber
company,
the
northern
pacific
against
boyd
that
we
remember
from
the
reorganization
days
and
those
cases
held
that
there
is
a
rule
of
absolute
priorities
in
equity
that
you
just
don’t
sit
down
and
do
curbstone
equity
and
let
people
just
keep
money
or
reshuffle
the
rights
and
put
shareholder
ahead
of
creditors
or
whatever
may
be
sought.
now
with
regard
to
the
type
of
regulation
that
we
have
in
illinois
that
the
attorney
general’s
office
has
been
speaking
of,
he
says
that
they
can’t
buy
--
they
can’t
invest
any
other
money.
justice
stewart
asked
whether
they
are
limited
to
investments
and
homes
i
believe.
the
answer
is,
if
we’re
going
to
take
what
happened
here,
if
we
look
at
page
10
of
the
brief,
we
find
that
they
invested
a
million
dollars
in
a
golf
course,
806,000
in
two
golf
courses.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
well,
this
is
--
but
the
answer
is
--
the
answer
he
gave
was
wrong,
it’s
the
reverse
of
the
fact.
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
we
have
the
detailed
facts
that
justice
fortas
was
asking
about.
he
said,
what
are
the
rights
of
shareholders,
what
are
the
specific,
simple
little
things
here.
here
they
are
at
the
top
page
11.
under
certain
conditions,
management
can
invest
more
than
45%
of
the
association’s
total
assets
as
follows;
45%
certain
marketable
investment
securities,
15%
at
section
792.8,
initial
purchase
and
development
of
residential
property
is
10%,
792.7
direct
general
obligations
and
certain
political
subdivisions.
obligations
of
urban
renewal
investment
corporations,
other
investments,
these
are
minimal
standards
and
they’re
so
broad
that
they
can
do
almost
anything
and
the
result
is
that
they
can
get
into
all
of
these
sort
of
things
for
periods
of
years
and
lend
and
renew
$65
million
indicating
the
total
number
or
renewals
here
without
any
interference
by
the
state.
now
as
far
as
the
attitude
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
the
answer
is
that
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
does
approve
of
this
idea
that
these
are
violations
of
the
‘34
act.
and
the
proof
of
that
is
that
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
sent
out
a
letter
to
every
savings
and
loan
insured
association
this
country
suggesting
to
them
that
they
better
check
their
advertising
about
a
year
ago
because
they
were
advertising
that
they
were
paying
five
and
three
quarter
percent
on
their
accounts
and
they
really
weren’t.
the
five
and
three
quarter
percent
was
what
the
result
was
as
the
result
of
the
accumulative
interest
in
the
last
quarter
so
that
as
to
all
periods
prior
to
that,
they
were
in
violation.
well,
if
they
didn’t
believe
that
the
act
applied,
they
wouldn’t
have
written
a
letter.
as
far
as
the
question
of
justice
fortas
as
to
where
in
these
briefs
does
it
set
out
the
details
as
to
what
the
rights,
privileges
and
so
forth
of
an
investor
are,
there
are
five
pages
of
it.
section
by
section,
we
recite
them
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioners
and
we
give
the
section
references
point
after
point
which
has
been
completely
ignored
here
and
anyone
who
wants
to
read
it
can
find
out
exactly
what
you
have
voting
rights.
you
cannot
give
irrevocable
proxies.
it
is
not
true
that
these
proxies
are
any
different.
the
section
and
proxies
is
identical
to
the
section
and
proxies
for
a
general
business
corporation
in
the
state
of
illinois.
it’s
word
for
word
the
same.
now
the
fact
that
a
shareholder
in
inland
steel
or
any
other
corporation
doesn’t
choose
to
vote,
they
just
sends
that
into
management
year
after
year
because
he
has
confidence
in
management,
doesn’t
take
away
one
with
from
the
nature
of
the
security
or
the
nature
of
his
investment.
as
far
as
this
question
that
was
asked
about
the
brokers
under
the
--
what
would
happen
about
the
brokers,
why
do
brokers
register.
the
answer
of
the
attorney
general
was
that,
well,
they
could
be
reached
through
the
1933
act
but
if
we
hold
that
these
are
not
securities,
if
these
are
not
securities,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
white
who
asked
that
question,
they
--
the
s.e.c.
could
not
reach
them
under
the
‘33
act.
if
they’re
not
securities,
it’s
been
said
that
they’re
not
securities
under
the
‘33
act
or
under
the
‘34
act.
now
the
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
not
one
i
ought
to.
the
statement
was
made
that
this
is
a
class
action
brought
on
behalf
of
shareholders.
i
think
that
was
justice
stewart’s
question.
it
this
a
class
action
brought
on
behalf
of
all
the
shareholders.
the
answer
is
it
is
not.
this
is
an
action
by
the
liquidators
of
the
corporation
who
are
suing
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
shareholders.
they
have
taken
the
position.
they
are
not
going
to
allow
us
to
recover
the
moneys
and
assuming
we
win
of
which
we
claim
we
were
defrauded.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
say
that
the
liquidators
have
brought
an
action
there's
these
people
who
claim
to
be
lawful
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
that’s
the
state
chancery
action.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
us.
if
they
win
there,
they
will
still
oppose
us
getting
our
money
here
assuming
we’re
right.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
that
is
what
they
say
they
want.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
that
is
correct.
our
position
is
that
if
this
money,
100%
of
it
came
out
of
our
pockets
to
the
tune
of
$18
million
which
is
i
believe
the
amount
that
was
received
from
this
post
1959
people
that
no
part
of
the
money
that
came
from
our
pocket
should
go
to
the
shareholders
who
were
shareholders
prior
to
that
time
regardless
of
the
fact
that
they
may
have
had
suffered
and
their
coffers
may
have
been
empty
and
they
were
in
serious
trouble
because
of
the
actions
of
their
board
directors.
they
are
not
entitled
to
receive
our
money
no
differently
than
in
any
other
corporate
or
individual
situation.
we
are
not
on
a
par
with
them.
as
far
as
what
the
usual
interest
is,
justice
fortas
asked
about
that
i
believe
in
the
mensik
reply
brief,
they
put
in
a
picture
of
one
of
the
letters
and
the
letters
shows
on
the
right
is
exhibit
3a
or
appendix
3a.
it
says,
4%
on
prepaid
savings
--
on
prepaid
savings
share
certificates.
now
the
suggestion
was
made
that
the
association
may
issue
a
certificate
or
may
issue
a
savings
account
book.
the
illinois
act
makes
it
mandatory
that
he
insert
certificate
evidence
every
share
interest.
there
is
no
option
as
far
as
the
right
to
issue
that
the
association
can
hold
that
once
that
has
been
prepared
and
executed
and
can
issue
an
account
book
to
show
what
the
situation
is
in
this
person’s
own
--
each
person
own
so
many
shares.
the
--
as
far
as
the
--
i’m
sorry.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i’m
looking
at
my
papers
and
not
at
the
light.
