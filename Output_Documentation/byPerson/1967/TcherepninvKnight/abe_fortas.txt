justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
a
remedy
under
the
state
law?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
a
remedy
under
the
state
law?
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
have
a
right
to
sue
for
fraud?
justice
abe
fortas
that’s
unusual
isn’t
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that
wasn’t
quite
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
my
question
regarded
simply
the
state
law
provides
a
remedy
here
against
the
person
who
had
committed
this
and
named
as
a
fraud.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don’t
want
to
take
a
lot
of
your
time.
i
think
i’ve
got
you’re
your
answer
is.
justice
abe
fortas
the
savings
account
and
the
savings
bank
have
security?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
savings
account
and
the
savings
bank
has
security
by
your
reasoning?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
loomis,
the
various
federal
insurance
available
to
this
type
of
savings
and
loan
association.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
and
what
does
that
cover
in
terms
of
the
shareholder?
suppose
a
shareholder
--
suppose
somebody
advised
a
$1,000.00
share
in
this
particular
savings
and
loan
association
and
supposed
it
had
qualified
and
had
obtained
federal
insurance.
what
would
that
federal
insurance
cover?
justice
abe
fortas
pay
him
what,
how
much?
justice
abe
fortas
that’s
the
interest?
justice
abe
fortas
well
perhaps
the
savings
and
loan
council
will
tell
us.
justice
abe
fortas
where
in
this
record
is
there
a
statement
of
what
the
rights
and
privileges
are
of
a
person
who
buys
one
of
these
things
whatever
they
are?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
set
out
in
any
of
your
briefs
or
does
it
appear
anywhere
in
all
of
these
documents
we
have
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
yeah.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
could
guess
--
need
very
much
if
you
would
tell
us
just
exactly
what
this
is.
you
said
this
is
not
like
if
i
correctly
understood
you.
this
is
not
like
the
usual
savings
and
loan
transaction
or
instrument
or
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
but
this
is
a
typical
savings
and
loan
transaction.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
rights
does
a
man
–
when
a
man
goes
out
on
a
--
let’s
say
pays
a
$100.00
then
he
gets
a
passbook
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
shows
that
he
has
paid
them
a
$100.00.
now
what
are
his
rights?
justice
abe
fortas
what
are
his
rights
with
respect
to
capital
or
his
rights
with
respect
to
dividend
or
participation,
what
are
his
voting
rights
and
what
are
his
rights
on
liquidation?
justice
abe
fortas
in
a
sort
of
round
about
way
that
he
has
got
to
vote.
that’s
what
i
want
to
know,
it
says
those
ultimate
simplicities
that
unlikely
the
states
calls
about
his
vote,
what
right
he
has
to
--
money
and
what
right
he
has
on
liquidation
etcetera.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
are
his
rights
of
principle.
justice
abe
fortas
if
there
are
any
unpaid
dividends
when
he
applies
for
withdrawal,
does
he
have
a
right
to
get
that
with
bonus?
justice
abe
fortas
all
right,
now
upon
liquidation
what
happens?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
let
me
try
to
get
at
the
ultimate
simplicity
again.
a
person
who
has
paid
a
hundred
dollars
into
the
savings
and
loan
association,
in
the
event
of
liquidation
would
file
for
a
$100.00
plus
accumulated
an
unpaid
dividend.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
he’d
get
--
justice
abe
fortas
all
right.
then
he
gets
his
aliquot
share
of
the
assets
after
but
differed
to
other
creditors
for
rent,
light,
heat
and
whatever
else
it
may
have.
justice
abe
fortas
whether
he
is
on
the
parity
or
the
insurance
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
coordinate.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
ever
think
there
hasn’t
been
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
there
is
--
if
this
is
a
security
and
if
mr.
a
is
soliciting
persons
to
purchase
this
security
and
it’s
not
astounding
to
me
that
mr.
a
is
regarded
as
a
broker.
is
it
to
you?
justice
abe
fortas
it
is
traded
if
bought
and
sold.
he
solicits
somebody
to
buy
a
security,
assuming
this
is
a
security.
so
nothing
astounding
about
calling
him
a
broker
because
there
is
a
trade,
the
trade
being
from
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
it’s
a
trade.
it’s
a
trade
on
the
initial
issuance
of
the
--
in
order
to
confine
the
definition
of
trade
to
secondary
distribution
or
to
trading
on
the
over-the-counter
market
what
i
hear
as
i
gather
that
these
securities
if
they
are
not
traded
in
that
sense
that
there
is
a
purchase
and
a
sale,
there
is
if
it
is
an
intermediary
on
some
occasions
namely
this
mr.
a
who
solicits
somebody
to
buy
than
if
that
would
comes
down
there.
justice
abe
fortas
but
do
you
agree
that
‘33
act
--
the
fraud
provisions
in
‘33
act
applies
to
this
kind
of
instrument,
security
or
whatever
you
may
call
it.
justice
abe
fortas
what
difference
would
it
make
in
terms
of
state
interest
whether
that
person
had
thought
he
was
defrauded,
brought
action
under
the
‘33
act
or
under
the
‘34
act?
justice
abe
fortas
that’s
not
--
that
is
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
this
event
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned.
will
the
action
be
brought
on
the
‘33
act
or
‘34
act?
justice
abe
fortas
i
could
assume
that
your
agency
would
be
happy
if
there
has
been
fraud
here
to
have
people
who
were
the
victims
of
fraud
to
have
a
remedy.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
remedy?
do
they
have
a
remedy
here
under
the
‘34
act?
justice
abe
fortas
mister
--
your
preceding
counsel
said
that
a
suit
has
been
brought
in
chancery
against
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
the
fraud
if
that’s
not
the
same
thing,
that
is
say
these
particular
individuals
claim
that
they
individually
were
victimized,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
there
something
--
is
there
some
other
--
some
alternative
remedy
that
they
have.
if
i
understand
you,
you’re
telling
me
that
you
don’t
think
they
got
a
problem
down
the
‘33
act
because
of
statute
limitation
there
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
a
remedy
under
the
state
law?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
a
remedy
under
the
state
law?
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
have
a
right
to
sue
for
fraud?
justice
abe
fortas
that’s
unusual
isn’t
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that
wasn’t
quite
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
my
question
regarded
simply
the
state
law
provides
a
remedy
here
against
the
person
who
had
committed
this
and
named
as
a
fraud.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don’t
want
to
take
a
lot
of
your
time.
i
think
i’ve
got
you’re
your
answer
is.
justice
abe
fortas
the
savings
account
and
the
savings
bank
have
security?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
savings
account
and
the
savings
bank
has
security
by
your
reasoning?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
loomis,
the
various
federal
insurance
available
to
this
type
of
savings
and
loan
association.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
and
what
does
that
cover
in
terms
of
the
shareholder?
suppose
a
shareholder
--
suppose
somebody
advised
a
$1,000.00
share
in
this
particular
savings
and
loan
association
and
supposed
it
had
qualified
and
had
obtained
federal
insurance.
what
would
that
federal
insurance
cover?
justice
abe
fortas
pay
him
what,
how
much?
justice
abe
fortas
that’s
the
interest?
justice
abe
fortas
well
perhaps
the
savings
and
loan
council
will
tell
us.
justice
abe
fortas
where
in
this

there
a
statement
of

justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
could
guess

need
very
much
if
you
would

us
just
exactly
what
this
is.
you

--
which
shows
that
he
has
paid
them
a

now
what
are
his
rights?
justice
abe
fortas
what
are
his
rights
with

or
his
rights
with

what
are
his

what

justice

in
a

round
about

that

that’s

what

justice
abe
fortas
if
there
are
any
unpaid

when
he

does
he
have
a
right

justice

all

now
upon
liquidation
what
happens?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
let
me
try
to
get
at
the

simplicity
again.
a

association,
in
the
event
of

would
file

justice

fortas
is

justice

you
