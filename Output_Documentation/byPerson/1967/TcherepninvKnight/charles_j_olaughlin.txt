mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
my
position
that
from
an
inspection
of
the
act
itself,
from
a
consideration
of
policy
and
as
a
matter
of
history
that
the
particular
item
we
are
confronted
with
is
not
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
it’s
indeed
your
honor
a
rare
beast.
i
would
say
that
to
characterize
it
as
one,
a,
b,
c
or
d
is
something
that
perhaps
is
not
possible.
it’s
defined
under
the
illinois
statute
as
a
withdrawable
capital
account.
the
statute
uses
that
term
throughout
and
i
might
say
in
the
consideration
of
this
case,
it
may
be
important
to
note
that
in
savings
and
loan
has
chartered
under
the
illinois
law,
there
is
also
permanent
reserve
capital.
this
association
did
not
have
a
permanent
reserve
capital.
it
had
only
withdrawable
capital
account.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
certainly
would
not
be
binding
upon
this
court
under
any
consideration.
this
case
as
i
construed
it
is
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
intent
of
congress,
only
this
and
nothing
more.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
the
philosophy
--
your
honor,
i
think
this.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
may
i
address
that
in
a
big
picture.
i
would
say
this.
i
walk
into
a
savings
and
loan.
i
put
down
my
$5.00.
the
statute
says
to
me
that
the
association
must
give
me
either
a
certificate
or
a
passbook.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
passbook.
as
a
practical
matter
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
the
illinois
savings
and
loan
act.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
get
only
the
passbook.
i
defy
anybody
in
this
courtroom
to
tell
me
the
difference
so
far
as
the
average
investor
is
concerned
between
this
and
the
typical
savings
account
passbook
issued
by
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that
is
very
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
it
may
have
peripheral
effects.
i
might
say
this.
the
organizational
provisions
of
the
illinois
savings
and
loan
act
provide
that
a
certain
amount
of
minimal
capital
be
on
hand
that
i
would
say
that
so
far
as
the
organizers
or
developers
of
a
new
association
is
concerned,
they
may
look
at
it
a
little
but
differently.
but
to
answer
your
question,
i
question
very
much
,very,
very
much
indeed
that
the
average
investor
is
aware
of
1%
difference
except
the
--
what
he
is
talking
about
is
a
rate
of
interest
that
pays
maybe
a
quarter
or
a
half
percent
interest
more
than
the
bank
which
is
across
the
street
from
him.
i
think
since
we’ve
developed
the
argument
this
way,
it
might
be
well
to
point
out
a
few
salient
characteristics
which
i
think
are
of
vital
consideration
in
the
determination
to
this
question
and
that
is
savings
admittedly
bare
a
vote.
the
typical
association
provides
one
vote
for
every
$100.00
or
fraction
thereof.
but
notice
this
very
unique
provision
in
my
judgment.
there
is
no
limit,
no
limit
whatever
to
the
amount
of
accounts
that
can
be
taken
in
and
therefore
no
limit
to
the
amount
of
votes
that
maybe
cast
in
any
given
election.
what
i’m
saying
is
this.
you
compare
this
within
a
corporation
in
which
there
is
a
preemptive
right,
there
is
an
authorized
capital
and
what
have
you
which
is
designed
to
preserve
for
the
individual
owner
his
aliquot
portion
of
the
management
of
that
concern.
there
is
nothing
like
this
in
the
savings
and
loan
association
and
after
this
one
further
provision,
on
motion
of
the
board
of
directors,
any
depositor,
any
withdrawable
capital
account
maybe
redeemed.
an
investor
has
no
right
to
preserve
his
management,
his
equity
position
or
what
have
you
in
the
savings
and
loan
association.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well,
callable
stock
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
it’s
still
a
stock
but
it’s
generally
a
unique
type
of
stock.
the
equity
owner
generally,
a
stock
is
not
provisioned
or
subject
to
such
call.
that
is
nor
it’s
a
preferred
stock
or
special
type
of
stock,
something
unique
and
extraordinary
in
and
of
itself.
what
i’m
saying
is
this
your
honor.
i’m
really
following
on
mr.
justice
harlan’s
line
of
thought
as
to
these
are
the
owners.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
they
are
very
unique
owners,
very
selected
and
very
different.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor,
it’s
a
matter
of
the
illinois
savings
and
loan
act.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
what
--
the
specific
character?
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
think
your
honor
in
the
brief
we
submitted
that
is
on
behalf
of
the
city
savings
association
and
the
liquidators
we
have
set
out
in
quite
a
great
detail
what
the
unique
provisions
of
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
must
have
missed
all.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
it’s
not
the
usual
device
whereby
a
person
having
money
imparts
to
the
care
of
another.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
would
think
it
was
very
typical.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
right.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
normally
speaking
he
signs
a
proxy
at
that
moment,
the
moment
he
opens
his
account.
and
this
proxy
generally
states
that
it’s
good
until
revoked
and
then
only
for
the
particular
meaning
it’s
revoked.
as
a
practical
matter,
he
never
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
he
has
a
vote
which
i’m
confessing
that
he
has
but
i
say
it’s
very
limited
because
it’s
normally
not
exercised
because
of
the
nature
of
the
proxy.
he
has
a
right
to
receive
what
are
called
on
the
statute
dividends.
these
are
traditionally
declared
by
the
board
of
directors
out
of
earnings
after
the
provision
is
made
for
reserves
and
things
of
that
nature.
these
amounts
of
dividends
are
declared
routinely.
they
are
usually
advertised
current
rate
4.75
%,
4.5%,
i
would
say
determined
not
so
much
by
the
earnings
themselves
but
what
in
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
is
necessary
for
this
savings
and
loan
association
to
compete
with
its
competitors,
the
banks.
he
is
entitled
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
right
and
i
would
say
your
honor
that
it
need
not
be
earnings
for
the
specific
period
it’s
covered.
not
all
the
earnings
need
to
be
paid
out.
more
maybe
paid
out
in
earnings
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
principle?
he
is
entitled
to
apply
the
statute
says
for
immediate
withdrawal
and
that
the
savings
association
has
the
cash,
he
is
entitled
to
have
it
back
immediately
even
though
he
deposited
only
five
minutes
ago.
the
statute
provides
a
scheme
since
these
are
association
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor,
he
does.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor,
the
illinois
statute
provides
for
two
types
of
liquidation
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
federal
bankruptcy
act
specifically
provides
that
the
federal
bankruptcy
act
is
not
applicable.
it’s
a
matter
of
state
liquidation.
it
may
be
voluntary
or
involuntary.
this
if
voluntary
it’s
by
--
under
the
director
of
financial
institution,
the
commissioner
of
savings
and
loan
appointing
a
receiver.
under
the
voluntary
liquidation
which
we
provided
here,
it
is
under
liquidators
of
whom
i
speak
in
this
court.
it
provides
for
a
realization
of
the
assets
filing
claims,
i
would
say
that
there
are
many
questions
that
under
state
law
which
re--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
might
say
he
need
not
apply.
the
act
provides
that
he
need
make
no
application.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that
question
your
honor
i
think
is
a
matter
of
state
law
and
i
might
say
has
given
us
pause
as
to
the
relationship
between
the
withdrawable
share
accounts
and
the
creditors.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
my
answer
to
that
is
unequivocally
no
your
honor
and
may
i
explain.
the
act
specifically
provides
that
the
withdrawable
share
account
is
not
negotiable.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
it
is
assignable
which
of
course
means
the
assignee
stands
in
the
shoe
and
stands
the
defenses
if
any
which
may
be
urged
against
the
assignor.
as
a
practical
matter,
i’m
aware
of
not
a
single
assignment.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
particularly
when
you
read
the
preamble
to
the
1934
act,
it
specifically
states
that
the
act
was
designed
to
be
passed
to
meet
fluctuations
on
market
–
over-the-counter
market.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
share
that
question
with
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor,
i
might
say
this
that
this
is
one
of
the
sec
in
all
due
difference
dips
into
its
file
and
comes
out
with
--
i
believe
in
the
opening
brief
is
said
to
be
13
or
14
registration
statements.
i
do
not
know
what
these
registration
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i’m
speculating
your
honor
but
i
would
say
this,
if
he
were
doing
other
activity
subject
to
the
‘34
act,
he
might
say
also
soliciting
savings
on
loan
accounts.
i
would
say
this
that
it
would
be
the
solicitation
not
the
broker
dealing
part
of
that
that
would
be
applicable.
i
know
of
no
dealers
as
such.
there
may
--
there
are
persons
i’m
given
to
understand
although
i
have
never
met
them
never
seen
their
activity
who
solicit
funds
for
savings
and
loan
association
but
i
might
say
this
that
this
case
comes
on
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
record
is
indeed
bearing.
when
you
face
the
individual
categories
found
in
the
statute,
that
is
note,
stock,
treasury
stock,
bond,
the
venture,
certificate
of
interest
or
participation
in
any
profit
sharing
agreement
or
any
instrument
commonly
known
as
a
security
but
again
excluding
note,
draft,
bill
of
exchange
or
banker’s
acceptance
which
has
a
maturity
at
the
time
of
issuance
of
not
exceeding
nine
months.
i
think
proper
analysis
indicates
that
the
withdrawable
capital
account
of
the
savings
and
loan
association
does
not
comply.
i
particularly
would
like
to
emphasize
and
particularly
in
the
line
of
the
howey
case,
the
united
benefit
case,
the
variable
annuity
case,
this
consideration
in
a
typical
situation
where
a
person
having
funds
gives
them
to
another
on
an
equity
basis
he
stands
the
risk
of
capital
appreciation
a
return
of
some
consequence
in
the
savings
and
loan
association,
not
so.
if
you
could
conceive
of
the
unusual
situation
or
a
bonanza
was
had
where
the
fruit,
the
orange
groves
return
large
sums
of
money,
the
oil
lease
is
profited.
there
would
be
a
chance
that
that
investor
would
receive
money.
in
the
savings
and
loan,
he
will
receive
“the
current
rate
of
interest
or
current
rate
of
dividend”
as
the
case
maybe
as
it
is
described.
my
point
is
simply
this.
there
is
not
that
likelihood
of
incremented
value
which
this
court
spoke
up
in
the
united
benefit
case
and
the
variable
annuity
cases
which
led
this
court
to
characterize
those
instruments
as
securities.
because
this
interest
is
subject
to
redemption,
because
it’s
subject
to
dilution,
because
the
passbook
and
everything
indicates
that
this
man
is
entitled
to
a
return
of
its
capital,
all
indicate
that
there
isn’t
that
chance
of
capital
appreciation
which
lures
an
investor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor,
the
questions
which
you
address
to
mr.
loomis
and
i
share
some
of
the
same
lack
of
information
as
to
the
practice
of
the
industry
as
a
whole.
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
case
addresses
itself
the
whole
savings
and
loan
association
industry
as
such.
when
i
make
a
statement
in
open
court,
the
man
receives
a
passbook.
this
court
must
take
it
as
more
or
less
general
information
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
that
specifically
is
the
case.
i
think
that
i
have
done
--
the
counsel
has
done
--
we
have
all
done
a
scribe
general
practice
in
the
industry
and
things
of
that
nature.
i
can
state
unequivocally
that
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
there
isn’t
a
single
assignment.
there
isn’t
a
single
trading
that
we
are
aware
of
in
the
administration
of
the
essence
as
the
savings
association.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
wholly
agree
and
not
only
do
they
have
that
right
but
they
have
to
exercise
that
right.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
we
have
talked
to
them
informally.
they
covered
96%.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
they
represent
96%
of
all
the
deposits
and
your
honor,
i
know
that
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
do
provide
for
registration
of
those
soliciting
accounts.
they
do
provide
particular
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
can’t
answer
that
question
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
overlapping,
overlapping.
unnecessary
to
put
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
under
the
registers
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
it
could
be.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
think
so
far
as
federal
--
so
far
as
regulation
is
concerned
in
general,
there
is
a
detailed
state
proceeding
of
liquidation
and
i
might
say
this
in
the
trial
court,
there
was
a
motion
made
to
appoint
a
federal
district
court
receiver
for
this
association.
when
that
motion
was
being
considered,
the
sec
petitioned
that
such
a
receiver
not
be
appointed.
i
would
take
it
that
this
after
investigation
by
the
sec
is
a
vote
in
favor
of
the
state
court
liquidation.
i
would
say
to
answer
your
honor’s
question
specifically,
state
administration
is
adequate
--
it
is
adequate
and
if
there
is
any
area
not
filled
by
state
administration,
it
is
more
than
adequately
filled
by
the
federal
home
loan
board.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
you
see
this
was
not
a
state
or
this
was
not
a
federally
insured
association.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
only
if
it
were
insured
your
honor
is
my
understanding.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
what
i’m
saying
is
this,
96%
viewing
the
overall
position
and
whether
there
is
need
from
a
policy
basis
to
have
the
sec
participate
in
this
sort
of
thing,
it
would
be
applicable
at
most
only
3%
of
the
deposits
in
the
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
that
the
field
is
already
preempted
substantially
by
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
right.
it
would
have
assumed
that
like
all
the
way
around.
to
answer
mr.
justice
fortas’
question
as
whether
there
is
a
state
remedy
here.
not
only
is
there
a
state
remedy
but
a
state
remedy
has
been
invoked.
we
have
filed
a
chancery
litigation
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
which
has
been
pending
almost
as
long
as
this
case
has
been
seeking
to
surcharge
the
persons
who
administer
this
administration
for
their
elections.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
think
it
takes
it
out
from
the
need.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well,
i
think
whether
this
sec
has
jurisdiction
your
honor
is
a
matter
of
congressional
intent
and
whether
or
not
there
is
state
court
jurisdiction
as
such,
i
think
that
in
gauging
what
the
intent
of
congress
is,
the
availability
of
state
remedy,
state
procedure,
state
administration
is
a
factor
which
this
court
might
well
take
into
consideration.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i’m
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i’m
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that
was
the
question
of
insurance.
there
was
a
state
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
no.
i
understand
mr.
justice
black’s
question
right
now.
in
the
state
insurance
provision,
there
is
a
specific
provision
allowing
for
the
presence
of
state
administration
and
i
would
take
that
there
would
be
no
provision,
there
were
no
conflict
so
far
as
the
savings
and
loan
association
administration
by
this
commissioner
savings
and
loan.
i
would
take
that
a
duplicate
administration
would
be
feasible
where
they’re
desirable
along
with
the
third
agency,
the
federal
home
loan
bank
is
my
point
that
the
--
we
don’t
need
three,
two
is
enough.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
and
i
join
with
the
court
below
that
the
evidence
of
indebtement
omission
is
significant.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well,
the
‘34
or
the
‘33
act
has
but
the
‘34
act
does
not.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
no,
i
do
not.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
if
i
may
the
paradox
which
this
case,
which
so
far
as
i
can
see
as
unique
under
the
‘34
act.
if
counsel
were
to
prevail
here
to
the
extent
which
he
asks
to
prevail,
this
would
mean
roughly
that
15
million
of
depositors
took
priority
over
the
other
20
million.
a
result
i
think
under
some
--
in
my
judgment
highly
artificial
differentiation.
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
stewart
who
asked
the
question
what
was
the
significance
of
the
date
and
i
must
confess
every
time
we
ask
that
question,
we
get
a
different
answer.
at
one
time,
the
answer
was
that
the
date
meant
something
to
do
with
the
statute
of
limitations
and
other
times
it
meant
to
put
a
difference
with
some
changes
in
the
illinois
act
if
the
court
please,
i
think
that
the
date
is
of
no
significance
that
these
people
are
depositors.
i
find
no
--
if
there
were
a
fraud
here
which
led
to
the
additional
depositors
by
the
same
token
--
the
same
fraud
would
mean
that
the
depositors
are
already
there
maintain
their
deposits.
so
to
answer
your
question
specifically,
i
challenge
any
date
and
i
also
challenge
that
a
finding
under
the
--
that
this
was
a
security
would
mean
that
there
was
a
priority.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that’s
what
they
contend
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
roughly
speaking.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well,
i’m
--
when
i’m
answering
that
question
it
is
as
to
amounts.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that
is
to
amount.
number
i’m
not
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
when
you
tie
it
up
your
honor
with
the
bankruptcy
act
which
provides
it
that
the
administration
should
be
only
under
state
law.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
provision
can
only
be
true
when
the
association
is
insolvent
and
i
would
say
that
the
court
please
that
tying
those
two
acts
you
find
an
act
of
congress
that
if
there
is
a
question
of
priorities
that
that
is
committed
to
state
law
to
be
answered
under
the
acquiescence
of
the
federal
bankruptcy
act.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
my
position
that
from
an
inspection
of
the
act
itself,
from
a
consideration
of
policy
and
as
a
matter
of
history
that
the
particular
item
we
are
confronted
with
is
not
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
it’s
indeed
your
honor
a
rare
beast.
i
would
say
that
to
characterize
it
as
one,
a,
b,
c
or
d
is
something
that
perhaps
is
not
possible.
it’s
defined
under
the
illinois
statute
as
a
withdrawable
capital
account.
the
statute
uses
that
term
throughout
and
i
might
say
in
the
consideration
of
this
case,
it
may
be
important
to
note
that
in
savings
and
loan
has
chartered
under
the
illinois
law,
there
is
also
permanent
reserve
capital.
this
association
did
not
have
a
permanent
reserve
capital.
it
had
only
withdrawable
capital
account.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
certainly
would
not
be
binding
upon
this
court
under
any
consideration.
this
case
as
i
construed
it
is
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
intent
of
congress,
only
this
and
nothing
more.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
the
philosophy
--
your
honor,
i
think
this.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
may
i
address
that
in
a
big
picture.
i
would
say
this.
i
walk
into
a
savings
and
loan.
i
put
down
my
$5.00.
the
statute
says
to
me
that
the
association
must
give
me
either
a
certificate
or
a
passbook.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
passbook.
as
a
practical
matter
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
the
illinois
savings
and
loan
act.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
get
only
the
passbook.
i
defy
anybody
in
this
courtroom
to
tell
me
the
difference
so
far
as
the
average
investor
is
concerned
between
this
and
the
typical
savings
account
passbook
issued
by
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that
is
very
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
it
may
have
peripheral
effects.
i
might
say
this.
the
organizational
provisions
of
the
illinois
savings
and
loan
act
provide
that
a
certain
amount
of
minimal
capital
be
on
hand
that
i
would
say
that
so
far
as
the
organizers
or
developers
of
a
new
association
is
concerned,
they
may
look
at
it
a
little
but
differently.
but
to
answer
your
question,
i
question
very
much
,very,
very
much
indeed
that
the
average
investor
is
aware
of
1%
difference
except
the
--
what
he
is
talking
about
is
a
rate
of
interest
that
pays
maybe
a
quarter
or
a
half
percent
interest
more
than
the
bank
which
is
across
the
street
from
him.
i
think
since
we’ve
developed
the
argument
this
way,
it
might
be
well
to
point
out
a
few
salient
characteristics
which
i
think
are
of
vital
consideration
in
the
determination
to
this
question
and
that
is
savings
admittedly
bare
a
vote.
the
typical
association
provides
one
vote
for
every
$100.00
or
fraction
thereof.
but
notice
this
very
unique
provision
in
my
judgment.
there
is
no
limit,
no
limit
whatever
to
the
amount
of
accounts
that
can
be
taken
in
and
therefore
no
limit
to
the
amount
of
votes
that
maybe
cast
in
any
given
election.
what
i’m
saying
is
this.
you
compare
this
within
a
corporation
in
which
there
is
a
preemptive
right,
there
is
an
authorized
capital
and
what
have
you
which
is
designed
to
preserve
for
the
individual
owner
his
aliquot
portion
of
the
management
of
that
concern.
there
is
nothing
like
this
in
the
savings
and
loan
association
and
after
this
one
further
provision,
on
motion
of
the
board
of
directors,
any
depositor,
any
withdrawable
capital
account
maybe
redeemed.
an
investor
has
no
right
to
preserve
his
management,
his
equity
position
or
what
have
you
in
the
savings
and
loan
association.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well,
callable
stock
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
it’s
still
a
stock
but
it’s
generally
a
unique
type
of
stock.
the
equity
owner
generally,
a
stock
is
not
provisioned
or
subject
to
such
call.
that
is
nor
it’s
a
preferred
stock
or
special
type
of
stock,
something
unique
and
extraordinary
in
and
of
itself.
what
i’m
saying
is
this
your
honor.
i’m
really
following
on
mr.
justice
harlan’s
line
of
thought
as
to
these
are
the
owners.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
they
are
very
unique
owners,
very
selected
and
very
different.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor,
it’s
a
matter
of
the
illinois
savings
and
loan
act.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
what
--
the
specific
character?
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
think
your
honor
in
the
brief
we
submitted
that
is
on
behalf
of
the
city
savings
association
and
the
liquidators
we
have
set
out
in
quite
a
great
detail
what
the
unique
provisions
of
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
must
have
missed
all.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
it’s
not
the
usual
device
whereby
a
person
having
money
imparts
to
the
care
of
another.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
would
think
it
was
very
typical.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
right.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
normally
speaking
he
signs
a
proxy
at
that
moment,
the
moment
he
opens
his
account.
and
this
proxy
generally
states
that
it’s
good
until
revoked
and
then
only
for
the
particular
meaning
it’s
revoked.
as
a
practical
matter,
he
never
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
he
has
a
vote
which
i’m
confessing
that
he
has
but
i
say
it’s
very
limited
because
it’s
normally
not
exercised
because
of
the
nature
of
the
proxy.
he
has
a
right
to
receive
what
are
called
on
the
statute
dividends.
these
are
traditionally
declared
by
the
board
of
directors
out
of
earnings
after
the
provision
is
made
for
reserves
and
things
of
that
nature.
these
amounts
of
dividends
are
declared
routinely.
they
are
usually
advertised
current
rate
4.75
%,
4.5%,
i
would
say
determined
not
so
much
by
the
earnings
themselves
but
what
in
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
is
necessary
for
this
savings
and
loan
association
to
compete
with
its
competitors,
the
banks.
he
is
entitled
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
right
and
i
would
say
your
honor
that
it
need
not
be
earnings
for
the
specific
period
it’s
covered.
not
all
the
earnings
need
to
be
paid
out.
more
maybe
paid
out
in
earnings
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
principle?
he
is
entitled
to
apply
the
statute
says
for
immediate
withdrawal
and
that
the
savings
association
has
the
cash,
he
is
entitled
to
have
it
back
immediately
even
though
he
deposited
only
five
minutes
ago.
the
statute
provides
a
scheme
since
these
are
association
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor,
he
does.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor,
the
illinois
statute
provides
for
two
types
of
liquidation
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
federal
bankruptcy
act
specifically
provides
that
the
federal
bankruptcy
act
is
not
applicable.
it’s
a
matter
of
state
liquidation.
it
may
be
voluntary
or
involuntary.
this
if
voluntary
it’s
by
--
under
the
director
of
financial
institution,
the
commissioner
of
savings
and
loan
appointing
a
receiver.
under
the
voluntary
liquidation
which
we
provided
here,
it
is
under
liquidators
of
whom
i
speak
in
this
court.
it
provides
for
a
realization
of
the
assets
filing
claims,
i
would
say
that
there
are
many
questions
that
under
state
law
which
re--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
might
say
he
need
not
apply.
the
act
provides
that
he
need
make
no
application.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that
question
your
honor
i
think
is
a
matter
of
state
law
and
i
might
say
has
given
us
pause
as
to
the
relationship
between
the
withdrawable
share
accounts
and
the
creditors.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
my
answer
to
that
is
unequivocally
no
your
honor
and
may
i
explain.
the
act
specifically
provides
that
the
withdrawable
share
account
is
not
negotiable.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
it
is
assignable
which
of
course
means
the
assignee
stands
in
the
shoe
and
stands
the
defenses
if
any
which
may
be
urged
against
the
assignor.
as
a
practical
matter,
i’m
aware
of
not
a
single
assignment.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
particularly
when
you
read
the
preamble
to
the
1934
act,
it
specifically
states
that
the
act
was
designed
to
be
passed
to
meet
fluctuations
on
market
–
over-the-counter
market.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
share
that
question
with
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor,
i
might
say
this
that
this
is
one
of
the
sec
in
all
due
difference
dips
into
its
file
and
comes
out
with
--
i
believe
in
the
opening
brief
is
said
to
be
13
or
14
registration
statements.
i
do
not
know
what
these
registration
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i’m
speculating
your
honor
but
i
would
say
this,
if
he
were
doing
other
activity
subject
to
the
‘34
act,
he
might
say
also
soliciting
savings
on
loan
accounts.
i
would
say
this
that
it
would
be
the
solicitation
not
the
broker
dealing
part
of
that
that
would
be
applicable.
i
know
of
no
dealers
as
such.
there
may
--
there
are
persons
i’m
given
to
understand
although
i
have
never
met
them
never
seen
their
activity
who
solicit
funds
for
savings
and
loan
association
but
i
might
say
this
that
this
case
comes
on
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
record
is
indeed
bearing.
when
you
face
the
individual
categories
found
in
the
statute,
that
is
note,
stock,
treasury
stock,
bond,
the
venture,
certificate
of
interest
or
participation
in
any
profit
sharing
agreement
or
any
instrument
commonly
known
as
a
security
but
again
excluding
note,
draft,
bill
of
exchange
or
banker’s
acceptance
which
has
a
maturity
at
the
time
of
issuance
of
not
exceeding
nine
months.
i
think
proper
analysis
indicates
that
the
withdrawable
capital
account
of
the
savings
and
loan
association
does
not
comply.
i
particularly
would
like
to
emphasize
and
particularly
in
the
line
of
the
howey
case,
the
united
benefit
case,
the
variable
annuity
case,
this
consideration
in
a
typical
situation
where
a
person
having
funds
gives
them
to
another
on
an
equity
basis
he
stands
the
risk
of
capital
appreciation
a
return
of
some
consequence
in
the
savings
and
loan
association,
not
so.
if
you
could
conceive
of
the
unusual
situation
or
a
bonanza
was
had
where
the
fruit,
the
orange
groves
return
large
sums
of
money,
the
oil
lease
is
profited.
there
would
be
a
chance
that
that
investor
would
receive
money.
in
the
savings
and
loan,
he
will
receive
“the
current
rate
of
interest
or
current
rate
of
dividend”
as
the
case
maybe
as
it
is
described.
my
point
is
simply
this.
there
is
not
that
likelihood
of
incremented
value
which
this
court
spoke
up
in
the
united
benefit
case
and
the
variable
annuity
cases
which
led
this
court
to
characterize
those
instruments
as
securities.
because
this
interest
is
subject
to
redemption,
because
it’s
subject
to
dilution,
because
the
passbook
and
everything
indicates
that
this
man
is
entitled
to
a
return
of
its
capital,
all
indicate
that
there
isn’t
that
chance
of
capital
appreciation
which
lures
an
investor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor,
the
questions
which
you
address
to
mr.
loomis
and
i
share
some
of
the
same
lack
of
information
as
to
the
practice
of
the
industry
as
a
whole.
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
case
addresses
itself
the
whole
savings
and
loan
association
industry
as
such.
when
i
make
a
statement
in
open
court,
the
man
receives
a
passbook.
this
court
must
take
it
as
more
or
less
general
information
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
that
specifically
is
the
case.
i
think
that
i
have
done
--
the
counsel
has
done
--
we
have
all
done
a
scribe
general
practice
in
the
industry
and
things
of
that
nature.
i
can
state
unequivocally
that
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
there
isn’t
a
single
assignment.
there
isn’t
a
single
trading
that
we
are
aware
of
in
the
administration
of
the
essence
as
the
savings
association.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
wholly
agree
and
not
only
do
they
have
that
right
but
they
have
to
exercise
that
right.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
we
have
talked
to
them
informally.
they
covered
96%.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
they
represent
96%
of
all
the
deposits
and
your
honor,
i
know
that
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
do
provide
for
registration
of
those
soliciting
accounts.
they
do
provide
particular
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
can’t
answer
that
question
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
overlapping,
overlapping.
unnecessary
to
put
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
under
the
registers
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
it
could
be.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
think
so
far
as
federal
--
so
far
as
regulation
is
concerned
in
general,
there
is
a
detailed
state
proceeding
of
liquidation
and
i
might
say
this
in
the
trial
court,
there
was
a
motion
made
to
appoint
a
federal
district
court
receiver
for
this
association.
when
that
motion
was
being
considered,
the
sec
petitioned
that
such
a
receiver
not
be
appointed.
i
would
take
it
that
this
after
investigation
by
the
sec
is
a
vote
in
favor
of
the
state
court
liquidation.
i
would
say
to
answer
your
honor’s
question
specifically,
state
administration
is
adequate
--
it
is
adequate
and
if
there
is
any
area
not
filled
by
state
administration,
it
is
more
than
adequately
filled
by
the
federal
home
loan
board.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
you
see
this
was
not
a
state
or
this
was
not
a
federally
insured
association.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
only
if
it
were
insured
your
honor
is
my
understanding.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
what
i’m
saying
is
this,
96%
viewing
the
overall
position
and
whether
there
is
need
from
a
policy
basis
to
have
the
sec
participate
in
this
sort
of
thing,
it
would
be
applicable
at
most
only
3%
of
the
deposits
in
the
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
that
the
field
is
already
preempted
substantially
by
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
right.
it
would
have
assumed
that
like
all
the
way
around.
to
answer
mr.
justice
fortas’
question
as
whether
there
is
a
state
remedy
here.
not
only
is
there
a
state
remedy
but
a
state
remedy
has
been
invoked.
we
have
filed
a
chancery
litigation
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
which
has
been
pending
almost
as
long
as
this
case
has
been
seeking
to
surcharge
the
persons
who
administer
this
administration
for
their
elections.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
think
it
takes
it
out
from
the
need.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well,
i
think
whether
this
sec
has
jurisdiction
your
honor
is
a
matter
of
congressional
intent
and
whether
or
not
there
is
state
court
jurisdiction
as
such,
i
think
that
in
gauging
what
the
intent
of
congress
is,
the
availability
of
state
remedy,
state
procedure,
state
administration
is
a
factor
which
this
court
might
well
take
into
consideration.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i’m
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i’m
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that
was
the
question
of
insurance.
there
was
a
state
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
no.
i
understand
mr.
justice
black’s
question
right
now.
in
the
state
insurance
provision,
there
is
a
specific
provision
allowing
for
the
presence
of
state
administration
and
i
would
take
that
there
would
be
no
provision,
there
were
no
conflict
so
far
as
the
savings
and
loan
association
administration
by
this
commissioner
savings
and
loan.
i
would
take
that
a
duplicate
administration
would
be
feasible
where
they’re
desirable
along
with
the
third
agency,
the
federal
home
loan
bank
is
my
point
that
the
--
we
don’t
need
three,
two
is
enough.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
and
i
join
with
the
court
below
that
the
evidence
of
indebtement
omission
is
significant.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well,
the
‘34
or
the
‘33
act
has
but
the
‘34
act
does
not.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
no,
i
do
not.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
if
i
may
the
paradox
which
this
case,
which
so
far
as
i
can
see
as
unique
under
the
‘34
act.
if
counsel
were
to
prevail
here
to
the
extent
which
he
asks
to
prevail,
this
would
mean
roughly
that
15
million
of
depositors
took
priority
over
the
other
20
million.
a
result
i
think
under
some
--
in
my
judgment
highly
artificial
differentiation.
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
stewart
who
asked
the
question
what
was
the
significance
of
the
date
and
i
must
confess
every
time
we
ask
that
question,
we
get
a
different
answer.
at
one
time,
the
answer
was
that
the
date
meant
something
to
do
with
the
statute
of
limitations
and
other
times
it
meant
to
put
a
difference
with
some
changes
in
the
illinois
act
if
the
court
please,
i
think
that
the
date
is
of
no
significance
that
these
people
are
depositors.
i
find
no
--
if
there
were
a
fraud
here
which
led
to
the
additional
depositors
by
the
same
token
--
the
same
fraud
would
mean
that
the
depositors
are
already
there
maintain
their
deposits.
so
to
answer
your
question
specifically,
i
challenge
any
date
and
i
also
challenge
that
a
finding
under
the
--
that
this
was
a
security
would
mean
that
there
was
a
priority.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that’s
what
they
contend
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
roughly
speaking.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well,
i’m
--
when
i’m
answering
that
question
it
is
as
to
amounts.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
that
is
to
amount.
number
i’m
not
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
when
you
tie
it
up
your
honor
with
the
bankruptcy
act
which
provides
it
that
the
administration
should
be
only
under
state
law.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
provision
can
only
be
true
when
the
association
is
insolvent
and
i
would
say
that
the
court
please
that
tying
those
two
acts
you
find
an
act
of
congress
that
if
there
is
a
question
of
priorities
that
that
is
committed
to
state
law
to
be
answered
under
the
acquiescence
of
the
federal
bankruptcy
act.
thank
you.
