mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
regulatory
agency
who
regulates
the
savings
and
loan
associations
in
the
state
of
illinois.
we
are
here
on
behalf
of
the
commissioner
of
savings
and
loan
to
secure
an
equal
treatment
and
fair
treatment
of
all
the
depositors
in
this
association
and
not
to
have
one
group
prevails
over
another
group.
savings
and
loan
transactions
are
as
common
as
every
debt
in
our
everyday
life.
they
are
well
known.
they
weren’t
in
existence
long
before
the
1933
act.
they
existed
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
these
mutual
savings
and
loan
associations
or
if
you
wish
building
and
loan
association.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
they
would
sue
as
the
way
i
see
it.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
if
they
got
judgments
they
would
get
it
against
the
ones
who
defrauded
them.
this
would
be
the
management
as
they
alleged.
it
wouldn’t
be
from
their
fellow
depositors
who
have
this
identical
interest.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
for
the
association?
yes,
that’s
correct.
but
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
they
get
charge
against
the
assets
as
well
as
the
directors
as
you
wouldn’t
have
and
other
derivative
actions
where
you
would
have
the
directors
who
afre
really
the
primary
liable
for
the
acts
--
for
their
acts.
the
savings
and
loan
account
as
i
said
was
an
existence
long
before
1933.
this
distinguishes
from
the
variable
schemes
that
were
devised
after
the
1933
and
1934
acts.
it
distinguishes
it
from
the
alice
and
wonderland
variety
of
situations.
these
instruments
were
discussed,
debated
and
thoroughly
analyzed
in
the
--
before
the
securities
act
was
enacted
into
law.
as
mr.
loomis
pointed
out,
representatives
of
the
industry
of
the
building
and
loan
industry
did
come
to
congress
to
ask
for
an
exemption
because
of
the
fear
that
they
thought
they
would
be
covered
under
the
registration
provisions
and
that
there
maybe
a
possibility
that
these
accounts
would
be
covered
under
that
act
they
ask
for
their
exemption
but
still
maintain
that
they
would
desire
the
antifraud
divisions
to
prevail
against
it.
the
securities
act
did
provide
for
an
exemption
in
the
final
act
reported
out.
and
the
hearing
that
mr.
loomis
is
talking
about
is
about
a
bill
that
was
really
poorly
drafted
according
to
a
statement
by
dean
landis
who
was
the
principal
drafter
of
the
act.
he
said
that
bill
was
--
have
very
few
exemptions
and
later
many
new
exemptions
were
enacted
in
the
final
legislation.
in
1934,
the
congress
then
enacted
a
totally
new
bill.
it
did
amend
the
1933
act
but
did
provide
for
a
new
statutory
regulatory
scheme
for
transactions
that
would
not
previously
regulate
it.
the
bill
was
very
carefully
drawn
and
the
congressional
records
state
in
the
debate
that
there
were
more
than
five
revisions
of
this
particular
act.
it
is
said
in
the
congressional
record
that
every
word,
every
line,
every
sentence
in
the
bill
was
thoroughly
considered.
in
1934,
and
it
is
virtually
conceded
by
the
silence
of
the
s.e.c
and
council
for
the
petitioners,
there
is
not
any
mention
of
this
particular
interest.
the
only
thing
that
you
see
constantly
throughout
this
--
the
debates,
the
hearings
preliminary
to
the
passing
of
the
1934
act
is
that
there
is
a
desire
to
protect
the
institutions
descending
alone
institution,
the
bank
savings
--
the
mutual
bank
savings,
the
banks,
insurance
companies,
because
this
institutions
invested
in
securities
and
bonds
that
were
fluctuating
in
value
due
to
the
problems
that
were
raised
at
that
time.
there
was
a
desire
to
make
sure
and
protect
the
integrity
of
the
investments
of
these
institutions,
not
the
interest
that
are
involved.
in
fact,
you
see
and
most
of
the
discussions
in
the
congress
at
that
time
where
you
see
that
they
say
people
took
their
money
out
of
the
savings
and
put
them
into
work
with
securities.
they
want
--
there
was
no
desire
to
protect
the
particular
savings
interest
because
there
is
no
trading
in
this
and
we
could
see
this
in
the
section
2
of
the
act.
section
2
specifically
sets
forth
the
purpose
and
the
intention
of
congress
and
we
see
in
that
act
that
the
purpose
was
to
regulate
trading
and
the
traders
of
investments.
when
there
is
trading
then
the
regulatory
scheme
is
necessary
out
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
when
there
is
no
trading
as
in
this
case
then
the
regulatory
scheme
is
not
proper.
in
this
particular
association,
it
was
asked
whether
there
was
any
trading
of
this
--
in
this
particular
accounts
of
this
association
as
far
as
the
association
which
must
get
knowledge
of
all
assignments,
there
has
been
no
record
of
any
assignments
whatsoever.
with
regard
to
savings
accounts,
there
was
much
discussion
in
congress
not
only
of
savings
and
loan
accounts,
banks,
insurance
companies
were
all
considered
together.
this
is
the
way
the
congress
talked
of
these
institutions
not
distinguishing
between
a
bank
or
savings
alone
association
or
insurance
company.
they
lumped
the
consideration
of
these
institutions
because
by
the
very
nature
of
them,
they
were
the
type
of
institutions
that
would
come
under
a
similar
--
were
similar
in
nature.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
your
honor,
i’m
on
the
impression
that
there
are
solicitors
not
brokers
and
by
that
i
mean
the
solicitor
is
really
a
person
who
writes
to
an
individual
and
they
say
that
he
would
like
to
get
you
to
deposit
your
money
and
association
where
you
could
get
perhaps
5%
like
in
california.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
this
is
beyond
me
and
i
believe
that
the
s.e.c.
--
there
has
been
no
virtually
no
regulation
by
the
s.e.c.
of
this
broker
but
there
has
been
excessive
regulation
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
of
these
brokers
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
in
any
event,
the
s.e.c.
can’t
control
these
individuals
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
a
specific
remedy
is
provided
that
when
a
broken
or
when
any
--
when
there
is
a
violation
of
section
17(a)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933,
this
s.e.c.
has
power
under
the
1934
act
to
go
against
that
individual
and
that
appears
in
our
brief
on
page
24
where
we
state
that
section
15
specifically
provides
for
this
sort
of
situation.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
exactly
right
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
they
don’t
trade
in
it.
there
is
no
trading.
what
they
do
your
honor
is
they
--
at
the
issuance
which
is
specifically
a
‘33
situation.
they
only
seek
to
have
you
put
money
in
a
bank
or
saving’s
association
at
the
inception.
they
never
take
that
particular
account
and
transfer
to
another
individual.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
trading.
it’s
an
absurdity
in
this
particular
situation
because
anybody
could
go
into
an
association
and
open
an
account
anywhere.
he
could
close
out
his
account
and
go
next
door
and
open
up
his
account
in
some
other
association.
there
is
no
need
to
trade
these
accounts.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
they
do
your
honor
and
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
as
i
cited
in
my
brief
has
a
very
restrictive
regulation
on
this
particular
solicitors
and
i
--
again,
this
is
out
of
the
record
but
i
have
been
told
that
there
are
very
little
activity
after
this
regulation
because
it
was
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
who
restricts
these
people.
they
say
how
much
money
you
could
put
into
one
institution.
they
say
how
much
commission
you
could
get.
so
this
is
where
your
true
regulation
comes
as
in
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
not
the
s.e.c.
and
by
the
way,
the
(inaudible)
three
form
is
a
mere
informational
board.
this
is
as
the
s.e.c.
points
out,
it
doesn’t
really
regulate
them,
it
just
tells
them
that
we
solicit
the
particular
provision
as
the
solicitor
said,
it’s
loan
accounts.
solicitor,
that’s
all
they
do.
nothing
more,
no
trading
at
all
your
honor
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
s.e.c.
can
point
to
any
specific
provision
where
they
do
trade
them.
in
fact,
they
have
stated
in
their
brief,
they’d
only
seek
to
have
funds
placed
in
an
institution.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
exactly
your
honor
which
is
under
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
exactly
your
honor.
that’s
precisely
our
point.
so
there’s
no
real
trade
in
any
event
if
there
is
a
violation
under
section
17(a)
of
the
1933
act,
the
securities
act,
they
have
their
remedies
under
the
specific
provision
on
the
exchange
act
where
they
can
regulate
this
type
of
activity.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
he
maybe
regarded
as
a
broker
but
not
under
the
terms
of
this
act
because
this
is
not
the
type
of
interest
that
is
traded.
a
broker
as
i
understand
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
it’s
an
issuance
your
honor,
it’s
not
a
trade.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
your
honor,
it’s
correct
and
in
the
sense
of
the
solicitors
who
seek
to
have
you
--
they
issue
these
accounts
and
this
is
specifically
regulated
under
the
‘33
act
and
as
i
say,
these
individuals
are
really
regulated
very
much
so
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
because
they’re
the
ones
who
really
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
from
the
reading
of
the
legislative
history,
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
does
apply
because
the
legislative
history
specifically
says
that
these
people
did
come
to
seek
this
exemption
for
these
type
of
transaction.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
we
firstly
say
that
the
--
we
must
look
to
congressional
intent.
what
the
congress
intended.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
and
then
we
say
that
the
two
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
in
this
particular
case,
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
1933
act
would
come
under
section
12(2)
and
possibly
section
17(a),
and
in
those
particular
provisions,
the
congress
has
specifically
provided
certain
provisions
of
that
act
relating
thereto.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
statute
limitation.
the
limit
there
is
when
you
are
from
the
discovery
of
the
act
or
no
later
than
three
years
from
the
time
of
the
particular
act
of
defraud
is
committed.
in
other
words
you
cut
down
allegedly
on
this
class.
there
were
fewer
people
who
could
come
within
that
particular
provision.
secondly,
the
act
also
provides
that
this
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
and
state
court,
and
in
that
case
a
very
possible
in
the
sate
insolvency
proceeding,
we
have
--
say
liquidation
proceeding
where
the
court
has
already
taken
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
in
a
savings
and
loan
association.
the
federal
court
may
remove
it
to
the
state
court
and
join
and
consolidate
the
two
actions
and
could
hear
the
claims
in
one
entirety
and
save
on
expense
and
costs
in
that
particular
litigation.
and
thirdly,
the
accounts
in
this
particular
case
there
would
also
be
--
there’s
also
provision
in
the
securities
exchange
--
securities
act
of
1933
for
security
of
costs.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
well,
as
mr.
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
correct
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
no,
i
say
they
do
have
it
done
under
the
‘33
act.
they
would
have
possibly
an
act.
i
mean
assuming
they
could
prove
their
case.
the
allegations
that
they
make
insofar
as
if
there
is
such
a
cause
as
it
would
be
under
the
10(b)(5)
situation,
17(a)
and
12(2)
of
the
securities
act,
essentially
the
cause
of
action.
the
elements
are
essentially
the
same
except
for
the
statute
limitations,
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
security
for
cost
situation.
now,
as
far
as
the
state
remedy,
there
is
--
as
mr.
o'laughlin
says,
it
would
be
against
the
ones
who
defraud.
they
are
the
ones
who
really
have
caused
the
injury
to
these
people
and
it
would
be
improper
the
way
i
see
it
to
seek
recovery
against
a
group
who
were
in
the
same
with
similar
situation
because
the
type
of
interest
that
they
may
have.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
excuse
me.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
somewhat
distinctive.
but
as
i
said
that
there
is
a
possibility
and
we
have
said
that
in
our
brief
that
there
maybe
a
claim
under
the
‘33
act
if
assuming
there
is
the
elements
of
their
cause
of
action
provided
for.
we
just
like
to
state
that
the
industry
did
not
come
to
congress
in
1934
to
seek
any
exemption.
because
there
was
no
intent,
no
consideration
to
really
protect
--
really
cover
this
type
of
transaction.
the
only
indication
that
you
have
from
any
sort
of
association
such
as
a
mutual
savings
bank
or
savings
and
loan
association
or
an
insurance
company
seeking
any
sort
of
relief
if
there
were
any
coverage
was
by
the
mutual
savings
banks
and
they
only
ask
not
for
exemption
of
their
interest
but
for
an
exemption
of
municipal
bonds
because
they
invested
it
in
municipal
bonds
which
were
traded
and
they
felt
that
they
needed
to
have
some
exemption
because
this
is
one
of
the
investments
they
make
but
not
for
the
interest
that
they
were
involved.
therefore,
there
is
entirely
no
intent
to
include
these
type
of
insurance
in
the
‘34
act.
this
is
born
out
by
the
testimony,
by
the
hearings,
by
the
reports,
by
the
debates
that
a
petition
as
an
s.e.c.
has
demonstrated
nothing
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
the
s.e.c
brief
in
reply
to
our
brief
is
conspicuous
by
its
remedy
and
that
they
virtually
concede
the
congressional
history,
the
legislative
history
in
this
particular
act.
they
do
not
say
anything
to
the
contrary
and
it
is
their
burden
to
show
that
there
was
an
intent
to
include
as
particular
transaction.
and
then
--
and
we
have
in
1963
the
situation
where
the
--
the
hearings
had
conducted
and
chairman
cary
of
the
s.e.c.
testified
and
mr.
milton
cone
who
was
part
of
a
special
study
testified
in
regard
to
savings
and
loan
associations
and
savings
and
loan
accounts
and
they
said
that
these
account
should
be
exempted.
they
also
said
that
the
savings
and
loan
account
should
be
on
parity
with
bank
accounts
because
this
was
the
same
type
of
transactions
that
they
were
--
same
type
of
transactions.
they
also
said
that
there’s
normally
no
trading
in
these
type
of
interest,
nothing
at
all
and
it’s
very
unlikely
that
they
thought
that
this
type
of
interest
was
within
the
purview
of
the
1934
act.
then
we
have
an
understanding
that
these
type
of
associations,
building
and
loan
associations
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
are
mutual.
they
are
mutual
associations
and
this
is
born
out
by
the
theory
and
principle
behind
it
that
was
necessary
for
such
associations
to
prevail
during
the
30’s,
this
mutuality
where
you
don’t
have
one
group
of
depositors
on
the
neck
of
another
group
of
depositors.
they
all
work
together
and
shared
together.
this
was
the
concept
that
mr.
prather
in
his
article
that
we
cite
in
15
business
law
points
out
that
it
may
cause
the
building
and
loan
associations
to
have
a
very
good
record
during
the
30s
because
of
mutuality.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
same
thing
here
your
honor.
we
have
only
lenders
and
borrower
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
borrowers
are
members
under
our
statute.
illinois
statute
provides
that
they
are
members
as
well
as
a
depositor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
no,
no.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
i
believe
that
--
essentially,
not
really
that
much
difference,
it
maybe
so
that
there
was
this
concept
that
only
members
who
were
investors
in
the
association
could
borrow
but
under
our
law,
a
borrower
who
may
take
out
a
mortgage
on
this
house
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
a
depositor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
well,
yes
your
honor.
there
are
certain
regulations
provided
within
the
statute
of
what
type
of
mortgages
they
are
permitted
to
make
and
how
much
--
what
percentage
was
they
are
allowed
to.
this
is
regulated
by
the
statute
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
well,
usually,
the
concept
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
yes,
mortgage
loans.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
normally,
it’s
set
forth
in
the
statute.
we
cite
to
these
particular
investment
where
these
people
have
been
--
what
type
of
loans
they
are
permitted
to
make.
what
type
of
a
--?
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
well,
the
percentages.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
pardon?
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
yes
there
are
in
the
statute
--
you
say
you
could
only
borrow
up
to
80%
of
the
price
value
with
the
property
and
this
is
regulated
by
the
commissioner.
he
specifically
goes
into
this
to
make
sure
that
this
--
and
he
has
a
regulation
on
this
too
to
be
sure
that’s
carried
out
that
he
sends
in
his
auditors
and
his
examiners
and
makes
surprise
audits.
this
is
particularly
true
that
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
no.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
it
may.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
yes.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
yes.
this
is
provided
in
the
act
that
spelled
out
and
these
limitations
must
be
--
completely
complied
with
otherwise
they’d
be
violating
the
statute.
that
would
be
inter-election
their
election
of
their
duties.
therefore,
we
see
in
this
area
that
the
state
regulatory
agency
is
really
the
ones
who
do
the
regulation
in
the
savings
loan
and
that
as
the
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
variable
annuity
case
where
he
said
that
the
securities
law
become
much
--
less
relevant
when
you
have
the
state
regulation.
and
congress
recognized
this
as
well.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
traded
your
honor,
yes.
they
are
traded.
they
were
in
the
over-the-counter
market
shares
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
right
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
not
necessarily
conclusive
although
congress
was
looking
to
this
in
this
intent.
there
were
certain
limitations
put
on
the
trade
even
the
bank
chairs
although
there’s
a
different
type
of
situation
with
bank’s
stock
because
it
is
stock.
it
is
a
proprietary
interest.
they
have
nothing
else
--
they
are
only
concern
with
their
equity
interest.
there
is
not
this
concept
that
you
have
in
the
mutual
savings
and
loan
association.
it’s
a
distinct
type
of
interest
that’s
more
akin
as
congress
has
said
and
the
debates
appearing
in
the
1934
hearings
and
in
the
1963
hearings,
it’s
more
akin
to
the
savings
bank
deposit.
this
is
the
type
of
thing
or
the
deposit
in
the
savings
account
in
a
commercial
bank.
in
this
case,
we
have
this
as
we
said
one
group
against
the
other
and
it
would
be
quite
unclear
for
one
group
to
prevail,
breaking
up
this
concept
of
mutuality
that’s
so
important
in
the
savings
and
loan
industry.
the
s.e.c.
as
mr.
o’laughlin
pointed
out
did
come
in
and
aside
with
the
state
in
opposition
to
petitioner’s
motion
for
the
appointment
of
receiver
in
the
district
court.
it
would
be
improper
and
i
think
the
s.e.c.
was
correct
that
this
would
result
if
they
did
support
the
petitioner’s
argument
for
important
receiver.
it
would
result
in
a
strain
on
the
federal
state
relationships
in
this
area,
in
this
sensitive
area.
the
state
really
does
most
of
the
regulation
in
this
area
joined
with
the
federal
regulatory
agencies
over
and
96%
of
the
dollar
amount
of
these
particular
cases.
you
find
that
not
only
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
has
an
interest
in
this
but
you
have
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
in
banks
where
they
have
deposits.
in
fact,
we
must
look
to
the
instant
action
to
see
that
it
was
the
state
that
triggered
this
entire
situation
when
the
state
director
of
financial
institutions
after
a
surprise
examination
on
this
institution,
on
this
association,
took
and
sees
the
assets
of
this
particular
association.
it
was
this
surprise
order
that
focused,
that
brought
this
entire
situation
to
life
that
the
petitioners
would
have
any
knowledge
whatsoever.
if
we
look
then
to
the
true
intent
of
congress
and
balancing
the
equities
as
trying
to
see
that
all
depositors
are
treated
fairly.
that
is
the
state
which
a
role
is
adjusted
to
this
particular
situation
and
this
court
has
constantly
said
that
in
this
situation
--
where
the
state
role
was
adjusted
to
a
situation
such
as
particularly
in
liquidation
preceding,
it
is
then
we
should
leave
the
state
remain
to
regulate
the
particular
interest
involved.
historically
and
traditionally
then
in
conclusion,
it
has
been
proven
that
in
this
area,
the
state
regulates
and
not
any
specific
private
remedy
that
a
particular
individual
may
have
because
it
hasn’t
been
used,
there
hasn’t
been
any
need
for
this
because
the
state
has
done
this
and
because
of
that
concept
of
mutuality
in
the
savings
and
loans.
in
fact,
the
s.e.c.
has
done
very
little
in
this
area
even
though
it
may
have
had
the
power
to
regulate
the
--
in
certain
areas
with
regard
to
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
security
act
that
has
done
virtually
nothing
except
possibly
in
the
maryland’s
case
where
you
find
that
there
are
very
little
regulation
and
now
as
i
understand
that
there
is
very
strong
state
regulation.
therefore,
whenever
you
have
strong
state
regulations
coupled
with
federal
regulation
by
the
home
loan
bank
board,
by
the
federal
savings
and
loan
corporation,
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
this
in
it
of
itself
has
made
it
sufficient
in
this
particular
area
for
the
association
to
survive,
for
a
bank
to
survive
for
possibly
an
insurance
company
to
survive
and
the
securities
act
have
become
much,
much
less
relevant
in
this
area.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
well,
if
there
is
found
that
there
are
these
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
no
your
honor
but
its
possible
if
these
was
found
to
be
a
security
under
the
exchange
act.
the
s.e.c.
would
have
much
broader
powers
--
would
possibly,
i
don’t
conceive
of
it
but
it’s
possible
that
they
may
do
certain
things
that
they
normally
would
not
have
done.
now
they
have
had
powers
on
the
securities
act
and
then
virtually
nothing
as
far
as
i
can
see.
now,
you’re
correct
in
saying
about
the
specific
remedies.
here
again,
there
has
been
virtually
no
case.
there
has
been
no
case
law,
nothing
at
all
until
this
case.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct
your
honor
but
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct.
that’s
the
issue,
yes.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
but
your
honor
in
the
cases
before
this
court
--
in
this
case,
true
but
the
thing
is
this
court
has
discussed
the
concept
of
securities
acts
and
the
regulation
not
only
in
terms
of
intent
of
congress
but
has
said
that
in
its
opinions
in
variable
annuity
case
and
the
majority
opinion,
in
the
concurring
opinion
and
recently
it
was
discussed
that
the
state
regulation
was
of
primary
importance
and
that’s
when
the
securities
act
become
less
relevant.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
no.
but
i’m
saying
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
this
could
come
about
and
secondly,
this
private
remedy
has
--
would
do
create
a
chaos
we
think
in
this
particular
area
because
you’d
find
that
there
would
be
many
depositors
and
in
this
case,
petitioners
contend
5,000
depositors
and
savings
--
city
savings
and
loan
would
get
100
cents
on
a
dollar.
in
other
words,
approximately
50
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
yeah,
but
this
is
why
the
state
is
quite
concerned
about
this
--
because
if
they
would
prevail,
they
will
get
this
$15
million
lump
sum
as
opposed
to
virtually
nothing
for
the
approximately
12,000
depositors,
7,000
depositors
will
get
nothing
and
constantly
our
office
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
city
--
the
commissioner
of
savings
and
loan
receives
letters
daily
crying
out
for
these
people
to
get
their
money
and
they
would
get
their
money
now
but
for
this
case.
this
case
has
held
up
the
liquidation
of
this
particular
matter.
the
disposition
cannot
be
made
until
such
time
as
there
is
and
to
all
cases
under
the
statutory
law
as
well
as
the
federal
law.
we
could
not
pay
out
any
dividend.
they
are
ready
now
to
pay
out
a
liquidating
dividend
but
cannot
until
such
time
as
this
is
concluded.
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
regulatory
agency
who
regulates
the
savings
and
loan
associations
in
the
state
of
illinois.
we
are
here
on
behalf
of
the
commissioner
of
savings
and
loan
to
secure
an
equal
treatment
and
fair
treatment
of
all
the
depositors
in
this
association
and
not
to
have
one
group
prevails
over
another
group.
savings
and
loan
transactions
are
as
common
as
every
debt
in
our
everyday
life.
they
are
well
known.
they
weren’t
in
existence
long
before
the
1933
act.
they
existed
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
these
mutual
savings
and
loan
associations
or
if
you
wish
building
and
loan
association.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
they
would
sue
as
the
way
i
see
it.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
if
they
got
judgments
they
would
get
it
against
the
ones
who
defrauded
them.
this
would
be
the
management
as
they
alleged.
it
wouldn’t
be
from
their
fellow
depositors
who
have
this
identical
interest.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
for
the
association?
yes,
that’s
correct.
but
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
they
get
charge
against
the
assets
as
well
as
the
directors
as
you
wouldn’t
have
and
other
derivative
actions
where
you
would
have
the
directors
who
afre
really
the
primary
liable
for
the
acts
--
for
their
acts.
the
savings
and
loan
account
as
i
said
was
an
existence
long
before
1933.
this
distinguishes
from
the
variable
schemes
that
were
devised
after
the
1933
and
1934
acts.
it
distinguishes
it
from
the
alice
and
wonderland
variety
of
situations.
these
instruments
were
discussed,
debated
and
thoroughly
analyzed
in
the
--
before
the
securities
act
was
enacted
into
law.
as
mr.
loomis
pointed
out,
representatives
of
the
industry
of
the
building
and
loan
industry
did
come
to
congress
to
ask
for
an
exemption
because
of
the
fear
that
they
thought
they
would
be
covered
under
the
registration
provisions
and
that
there
maybe
a
possibility
that
these
accounts
would
be
covered
under
that
act
they
ask
for
their
exemption
but
still
maintain
that
they
would
desire
the
antifraud
divisions
to
prevail
against
it.
the
securities
act
did
provide
for
an
exemption
in
the
final
act
reported
out.
and
the
hearing
that
mr.
loomis
is
talking
about
is
about
a
bill
that
was
really
poorly
drafted
according
to
a
statement
by
dean
landis
who
was
the
principal
drafter
of
the
act.
he
said
that
bill
was
--
have
very
few
exemptions
and
later
many
new
exemptions
were
enacted
in
the
final
legislation.
in
1934,
the
congress
then
enacted
a
totally
new
bill.
it
did
amend
the
1933
act
but
did
provide
for
a
new
statutory
regulatory
scheme
for
transactions
that
would
not
previously
regulate
it.
the
bill
was
very
carefully
drawn
and
the
congressional
records
state
in
the
debate
that
there
were
more
than
five
revisions
of
this
particular
act.
it
is
said
in
the
congressional
record
that
every
word,
every
line,
every
sentence
in
the
bill
was
thoroughly
considered.
in
1934,
and
it
is
virtually
conceded
by
the
silence
of
the
s.e.c
and
council
for
the
petitioners,
there
is
not
any
mention
of
this
particular
interest.
the
only
thing
that
you
see
constantly
throughout
this
--
the
debates,
the
hearings
preliminary
to
the
passing
of
the
1934
act
is
that
there
is
a
desire
to
protect
the
institutions
descending
alone
institution,
the
bank
savings
--
the
mutual
bank
savings,
the
banks,
insurance
companies,
because
this
institutions
invested
in
securities
and
bonds
that
were
fluctuating
in
value
due
to
the
problems
that
were
raised
at
that
time.
there
was
a
desire
to
make
sure
and
protect
the
integrity
of
the
investments
of
these
institutions,
not
the
interest
that
are
involved.
in
fact,
you
see
and
most
of
the
discussions
in
the
congress
at
that
time
where
you
see
that
they
say
people
took
their
money
out
of
the
savings
and
put
them
into
work
with
securities.
they
want
--
there
was
no
desire
to
protect
the
particular
savings
interest
because
there
is
no
trading
in
this
and
we
could
see
this
in
the
section
2
of
the
act.
section
2
specifically
sets
forth
the
purpose
and
the
intention
of
congress
and
we
see
in
that
act
that
the
purpose
was
to
regulate
trading
and
the
traders
of
investments.
when
there
is
trading
then
the
regulatory
scheme
is
necessary
out
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
when
there
is
no
trading
as
in
this
case
then
the
regulatory
scheme
is
not
proper.
in
this
particular
association,
it
was
asked
whether
there
was
any
trading
of
this
--
in
this
particular
accounts
of
this
association
as
far
as
the
association
which
must
get
knowledge
of
all
assignments,
there
has
been
no
record
of
any
assignments
whatsoever.
with
regard
to
savings
accounts,
there
was
much
discussion
in
congress
not
only
of
savings
and
loan
accounts,
banks,
insurance
companies
were
all
considered
together.
this
is
the
way
the
congress
talked
of
these
institutions
not
distinguishing
between
a
bank
or
savings
alone
association
or
insurance
company.
they
lumped
the
consideration
of
these
institutions
because
by
the
very
nature
of
them,
they
were
the
type
of
institutions
that
would
come
under
a
similar
--
were
similar
in
nature.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
your
honor,
i’m
on
the
impression
that
there
are
solicitors
not
brokers
and
by
that
i
mean
the
solicitor
is
really
a
person
who
writes
to
an
individual
and
they
say
that
he
would
like
to
get
you
to
deposit
your
money
and
association
where
you
could
get
perhaps
5%
like
in
california.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
this
is
beyond
me
and
i
believe
that
the
s.e.c.
--
there
has
been
no
virtually
no
regulation
by
the
s.e.c.
of
this
broker
but
there
has
been
excessive
regulation
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
of
these
brokers
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
in
any
event,
the
s.e.c.
can’t
control
these
individuals
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
a
specific
remedy
is
provided
that
when
a
broken
or
when
any
--
when
there
is
a
violation
of
section
17(a)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933,
this
s.e.c.
has
power
under
the
1934
act
to
go
against
that
individual
and
that
appears
in
our
brief
on
page
24
where
we
state
that
section
15
specifically
provides
for
this
sort
of
situation.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
exactly
right
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
they
don’t
trade
in
it.
there
is
no
trading.
what
they
do
your
honor
is
they
--
at
the
issuance
which
is
specifically
a
‘33
situation.
they
only
seek
to
have
you
put
money
in
a
bank
or
saving’s
association
at
the
inception.
they
never
take
that
particular
account
and
transfer
to
another
individual.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
trading.
it’s
an
absurdity
in
this
particular
situation
because
anybody
could
go
into
an
association
and
open
an
account
anywhere.
he
could
close
out
his
account
and
go
next
door
and
open
up
his
account
in
some
other
association.
there
is
no
need
to
trade
these
accounts.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
they
do
your
honor
and
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
as
i
cited
in
my
brief
has
a
very
restrictive
regulation
on
this
particular
solicitors
and
i
--
again,
this
is
out
of
the
record
but
i
have
been
told
that
there
are
very
little
activity
after
this
regulation
because
it
was
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
who
restricts
these
people.
they
say
how
much
money
you
could
put
into
one
institution.
they
say
how
much
commission
you
could
get.
so
this
is
where
your
true
regulation
comes
as
in
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
not
the
s.e.c.
and
by
the
way,
the
(inaudible)
three
form
is
a
mere
informational
board.
this
is
as
the
s.e.c.
points
out,
it
doesn’t
really
regulate
them,
it
just
tells
them
that
we
solicit
the
particular
provision
as
the
solicitor
said,
it’s
loan
accounts.
solicitor,
that’s
all
they
do.
nothing
more,
no
trading
at
all
your
honor
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
s.e.c.
can
point
to
any
specific
provision
where
they
do
trade
them.
in
fact,
they
have
stated
in
their
brief,
they’d
only
seek
to
have
funds
placed
in
an
institution.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
exactly
your
honor
which
is
under
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
exactly
your
honor.
that’s
precisely
our
point.
so
there’s
no
real
trade
in
any
event
if
there
is
a
violation
under
section
17(a)
of
the
1933
act,
the
securities
act,
they
have
their
remedies
under
the
specific
provision
on
the
exchange
act
where
they
can
regulate
this
type
of
activity.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
he
maybe
regarded
as
a
broker
but
not
under
the
terms
of
this
act
because
this
is
not
the
type
of
interest
that
is
traded.
a
broker
as
i
understand
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
it’s
an
issuance
your
honor,
it’s
not
a
trade.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
your
honor,
it’s
correct
and
in
the
sense
of
the
solicitors
who
seek
to
have
you
--
they
issue
these
accounts
and
this
is
specifically
regulated
under
the
‘33
act
and
as
i
say,
these
individuals
are
really
regulated
very
much
so
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
because
they’re
the
ones
who
really
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
from
the
reading
of
the
legislative
history,
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
does
apply
because
the
legislative
history
specifically
says
that
these
people
did
come
to
seek
this
exemption
for
these
type
of
transaction.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
we
firstly
say
that
the
--
we
must
look
to
congressional
intent.
what
the
congress
intended.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
and
then
we
say
that
the
two
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
in
this
particular
case,
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
1933
act
would
come
under
section
12(2)
and
possibly
section
17(a),
and
in
those
particular
provisions,
the
congress
has
specifically
provided
certain
provisions
of
that
act
relating
thereto.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
statute
limitation.
the
limit
there
is
when
you
are
from
the
discovery
of
the
act
or
no
later
than
three
years
from
the
time
of
the
particular
act
of
defraud
is
committed.
in
other
words
you
cut
down
allegedly
on
this
class.
there
were
fewer
people
who
could
come
within
that
particular
provision.
secondly,
the
act
also
provides
that
this
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
and
state
court,
and
in
that
case
a
very
possible
in
the
sate
insolvency
proceeding,
we
have
--
say
liquidation
proceeding
where
the
court
has
already
taken
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
in
a
savings
and
loan
association.
the
federal
court
may
remove
it
to
the
state
court
and
join
and
consolidate
the
two
actions
and
could
hear
the
claims
in
one
entirety
and
save
on
expense
and
costs
in
that
particular
litigation.
and
thirdly,
the
accounts
in
this
particular
case
there
would
also
be
--
there’s
also
provision
in
the
securities
exchange
--
securities
act
of
1933
for
security
of
costs.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
well,
as
mr.
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
correct
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
no,
i
say
they
do
have
it
done
under
the
‘33
act.
they
would
have
possibly
an
act.
i
mean
assuming
they
could
prove
their
case.
the
allegations
that
they
make
insofar
as
if
there
is
such
a
cause
as
it
would
be
under
the
10(b)(5)
situation,
17(a)
and
12(2)
of
the
securities
act,
essentially
the
cause
of
action.
the
elements
are
essentially
the
same
except
for
the
statute
limitations,
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
security
for
cost
situation.
now,
as
far
as
the
state
remedy,
there
is
--
as
mr.
o'laughlin
says,
it
would
be
against
the
ones
who
defraud.
they
are
the
ones
who
really
have
caused
the
injury
to
these
people
and
it
would
be
improper
the
way
i
see
it
to
seek
recovery
against
a
group
who
were
in
the
same
with
similar
situation
because
the
type
of
interest
that
they
may
have.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
excuse
me.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
somewhat
distinctive.
but
as
i
said
that
there
is
a
possibility
and
we
have
said
that
in
our
brief
that
there
maybe
a
claim
under
the
‘33
act
if
assuming
there
is
the
elements
of
their
cause
of
action
provided
for.
we
just
like
to
state
that
the
industry
did
not
come
to
congress
in
1934
to
seek
any
exemption.
because
there
was
no
intent,
no
consideration
to
really
protect
--
really
cover
this
type
of
transaction.
the
only
indication
that
you
have
from
any
sort
of
association
such
as
a
mutual
savings
bank
or
savings
and
loan
association
or
an
insurance
company
seeking
any
sort
of
relief
if
there
were
any
coverage
was
by
the
mutual
savings
banks
and
they
only
ask
not
for
exemption
of
their
interest
but
for
an
exemption
of
municipal
bonds
because
they
invested
it
in
municipal
bonds
which
were
traded
and
they
felt
that
they
needed
to
have
some
exemption
because
this
is
one
of
the
investments
they
make
but
not
for
the
interest
that
they
were
involved.
therefore,
there
is
entirely
no
intent
to
include
these
type
of
insurance
in
the
‘34
act.
this
is
born
out
by
the
testimony,
by
the
hearings,
by
the
reports,
by
the
debates
that
a
petition
as
an
s.e.c.
has
demonstrated
nothing
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
the
s.e.c
brief
in
reply
to
our
brief
is
conspicuous
by
its
remedy
and
that
they
virtually
concede
the
congressional
history,
the
legislative
history
in
this
particular
act.
they
do
not
say
anything
to
the
contrary
and
it
is
their
burden
to
show
that
there
was
an
intent
to
include
as
particular
transaction.
and
then
--
and
we
have
in
1963
the
situation
where
the
--
the
hearings
had
conducted
and
chairman
cary
of
the
s.e.c.
testified
and
mr.
milton
cone
who
was
part
of
a
special
study
testified
in
regard
to
savings
and
loan
associations
and
savings
and
loan
accounts
and
they
said
that
these
account
should
be
exempted.
they
also
said
that
the
savings
and
loan
account
should
be
on
parity
with
bank
accounts
because
this
was
the
same
type
of
transactions
that
they
were
--
same
type
of
transactions.
they
also
said
that
there’s
normally
no
trading
in
these
type
of
interest,
nothing
at
all
and
it’s
very
unlikely
that
they
thought
that
this
type
of
interest
was
within
the
purview
of
the
1934
act.
then
we
have
an
understanding
that
these
type
of
associations,
building
and
loan
associations
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
are
mutual.
they
are
mutual
associations
and
this
is
born
out
by
the
theory
and
principle
behind
it
that
was
necessary
for
such
associations
to
prevail
during
the
30’s,
this
mutuality
where
you
don’t
have
one
group
of
depositors
on
the
neck
of
another
group
of
depositors.
they
all
work
together
and
shared
together.
this
was
the
concept
that
mr.
prather
in
his
article
that
we
cite
in
15
business
law
points
out
that
it
may
cause
the
building
and
loan
associations
to
have
a
very
good
record
during
the
30s
because
of
mutuality.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
same
thing
here
your
honor.
we
have
only
lenders
and
borrower
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
borrowers
are
members
under
our
statute.
illinois
statute
provides
that
they
are
members
as
well
as
a
depositor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
no,
no.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
i
believe
that
--
essentially,
not
really
that
much
difference,
it
maybe
so
that
there
was
this
concept
that
only
members
who
were
investors
in
the
association
could
borrow
but
under
our
law,
a
borrower
who
may
take
out
a
mortgage
on
this
house
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
a
depositor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
well,
yes
your
honor.
there
are
certain
regulations
provided
within
the
statute
of
what
type
of
mortgages
they
are
permitted
to
make
and
how
much
--
what
percentage
was
they
are
allowed
to.
this
is
regulated
by
the
statute
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
well,
usually,
the
concept
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
yes,
mortgage
loans.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
normally,
it’s
set
forth
in
the
statute.
we
cite
to
these
particular
investment
where
these
people
have
been
--
what
type
of
loans
they
are
permitted
to
make.
what
type
of
a
--?
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
well,
the
percentages.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
pardon?
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
yes
there
are
in
the
statute
--
you
say
you
could
only
borrow
up
to
80%
of
the
price
value
with
the
property
and
this
is
regulated
by
the
commissioner.
he
specifically
goes
into
this
to
make
sure
that
this
--
and
he
has
a
regulation
on
this
too
to
be
sure
that’s
carried
out
that
he
sends
in
his
auditors
and
his
examiners
and
makes
surprise
audits.
this
is
particularly
true
that
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
no.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
it
may.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
yes.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
yes.
this
is
provided
in
the
act
that
spelled
out
and
these
limitations
must
be
--
completely
complied
with
otherwise
they’d
be
violating
the
statute.
that
would
be
inter-election
their
election
of
their
duties.
therefore,
we
see
in
this
area
that
the
state
regulatory
agency
is
really
the
ones
who
do
the
regulation
in
the
savings
loan
and
that
as
the
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
variable
annuity
case
where
he
said
that
the
securities
law
become
much
--
less
relevant
when
you
have
the
state
regulation.
and
congress
recognized
this
as
well.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
traded
your
honor,
yes.
they
are
traded.
they
were
in
the
over-the-counter
market
shares
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
right
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
not
necessarily
conclusive
although
congress
was
looking
to
this
in
this
intent.
there
were
certain
limitations
put
on
the
trade
even
the
bank
chairs
although
there’s
a
different
type
of
situation
with
bank’s
stock
because
it
is
stock.
it
is
a
proprietary
interest.
they
have
nothing
else
--
they
are
only
concern
with
their
equity
interest.
there
is
not
this
concept
that
you
have
in
the
mutual
savings
and
loan
association.
it’s
a
distinct
type
of
interest
that’s
more
akin
as
congress
has
said
and
the
debates
appearing
in
the
1934
hearings
and
in
the
1963
hearings,
it’s
more
akin
to
the
savings
bank
deposit.
this
is
the
type
of
thing
or
the
deposit
in
the
savings
account
in
a
commercial
bank.
in
this
case,
we
have
this
as
we
said
one
group
against
the
other
and
it
would
be
quite
unclear
for
one
group
to
prevail,
breaking
up
this
concept
of
mutuality
that’s
so
important
in
the
savings
and
loan
industry.
the
s.e.c.
as
mr.
o’laughlin
pointed
out
did
come
in
and
aside
with
the
state
in
opposition
to
petitioner’s
motion
for
the
appointment
of
receiver
in
the
district
court.
it
would
be
improper
and
i
think
the
s.e.c.
was
correct
that
this
would
result
if
they
did
support
the
petitioner’s
argument
for
important
receiver.
it
would
result
in
a
strain
on
the
federal
state
relationships
in
this
area,
in
this
sensitive
area.
the
state
really
does
most
of
the
regulation
in
this
area
joined
with
the
federal
regulatory
agencies
over
and
96%
of
the
dollar
amount
of
these
particular
cases.
you
find
that
not
only
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
has
an
interest
in
this
but
you
have
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
in
banks
where
they
have
deposits.
in
fact,
we
must
look
to
the
instant
action
to
see
that
it
was
the
state
that
triggered
this
entire
situation
when
the
state
director
of
financial
institutions
after
a
surprise
examination
on
this
institution,
on
this
association,
took
and
sees
the
assets
of
this
particular
association.
it
was
this
surprise
order
that
focused,
that
brought
this
entire
situation
to
life
that
the
petitioners
would
have
any
knowledge
whatsoever.
if
we
look
then
to
the
true
intent
of
congress
and
balancing
the
equities
as
trying
to
see
that
all
depositors
are
treated
fairly.
that
is
the
state
which
a
role
is
adjusted
to
this
particular
situation
and
this
court
has
constantly
said
that
in
this
situation
--
where
the
state
role
was
adjusted
to
a
situation
such
as
particularly
in
liquidation
preceding,
it
is
then
we
should
leave
the
state
remain
to
regulate
the
particular
interest
involved.
historically
and
traditionally
then
in
conclusion,
it
has
been
proven
that
in
this
area,
the
state
regulates
and
not
any
specific
private
remedy
that
a
particular
individual
may
have
because
it
hasn’t
been
used,
there
hasn’t
been
any
need
for
this
because
the
state
has
done
this
and
because
of
that
concept
of
mutuality
in
the
savings
and
loans.
in
fact,
the
s.e.c.
has
done
very
little
in
this
area
even
though
it
may
have
had
the
power
to
regulate
the
--
in
certain
areas
with
regard
to
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
security
act
that
has
done
virtually
nothing
except
possibly
in
the
maryland’s
case
where
you
find
that
there
are
very
little
regulation
and
now
as
i
understand
that
there
is
very
strong
state
regulation.
therefore,
whenever
you
have
strong
state
regulations
coupled
with
federal
regulation
by
the
home
loan
bank
board,
by
the
federal
savings
and
loan
corporation,
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
this
in
it
of
itself
has
made
it
sufficient
in
this
particular
area
for
the
association
to
survive,
for
a
bank
to
survive
for
possibly
an
insurance
company
to
survive
and
the
securities
act
have
become
much,
much
less
relevant
in
this
area.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
well,
if
there
is
found
that
there
are
these
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
no
your
honor
but
its
possible
if
these
was
found
to
be
a
security
under
the
exchange
act.
the
s.e.c.
would
have
much
broader
powers
--
would
possibly,
i
don’t
conceive
of
it
but
it’s
possible
that
they
may
do
certain
things
that
they
normally
would
not
have
done.
now
they
have
had
powers
on
the
securities
act
and
then
virtually
nothing
as
far
as
i
can
see.
now,
you’re
correct
in
saying
about
the
specific
remedies.
here
again,
there
has
been
virtually
no
case.
there
has
been
no
case
law,
nothing
at
all
until
this
case.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct
your
honor
but
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
that’s
correct.
that’s
the
issue,
yes.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
but
your
honor
in
the
cases
before
this
court
--
in
this
case,
true
but
the
thing
is
this
court
has
discussed
the
concept
of
securities
acts
and
the
regulation
not
only
in
terms
of
intent
of
congress
but
has
said
that
in
its
opinions
in
variable
annuity
case
and
the
majority
opinion,
in
the
concurring
opinion
and
recently
it
was
discussed
that
the
state
regulation
was
of
primary
importance
and
that’s
when
the
securities
act
become
less
relevant.
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
no.
but
i’m
saying
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
this
could
come
about
and
secondly,
this
private
remedy
has
--
would
do
create
a
chaos
we
think
in
this
particular
area
because
you’d
find
that
there
would
be
many
depositors
and
in
this
case,
petitioners
contend
5,000
depositors
and
savings
--
city
savings
and
loan
would
get
100
cents
on
a
dollar.
in
other
words,
approximately
50
--
mr.
stuart
d.
perlman
yeah,
but
this
is
why
the
state
is
quite
concerned
about
this
--
because
if
they
would
prevail,
they
will
get
this
$15
million
lump
sum
as
opposed
to
virtually
nothing
for
the
approximately
12,000
depositors,
7,000
depositors
will
get
nothing
and
constantly
our
office
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
city
--
the
commissioner
of
savings
and
loan
receives
letters
daily
crying
out
for
these
people
to
get
their
money
and
they
would
get
their
money
now
but
for
this
case.
this
case
has
held
up
the
liquidation
of
this
particular
matter.
the
disposition
cannot
be
made
until
such
time
as
there
is
and
to
all
cases
under
the
statutory
law
as
well
as
the
federal
law.
we
could
not
pay
out
any
dividend.
they
are
ready
now
to
pay
out
a
liquidating
dividend
but
cannot
until
such
time
as
this
is
concluded.
thank
you.
