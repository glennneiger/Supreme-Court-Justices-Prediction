what
is
the
relevance
of
that
date?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
loomis,
can
you
enlighten
me
a
little
bit.
you’re
speaking
as
though
all
savings
and
loan
are
organized
the
same
way,
is
that
in
fact
true?
justice
potter
stewart
savings
and
loans,
are
they
sometimes
called
building
and
loan
society,
that
i
suppose
they
are
the
same
or
they’re
different
or
were
an
import
from
germany
largely
or
central
new
york
in
the
19th
century
into
this
country?
they
originally
began
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
they’ve
been
quite
mistaken
as
membership
organizations
in
which
only
the
members
could
borrow
and
in
which
the
members
also
share
the
profits
of
redounding
to
the
institution
because
of
the
mortgage
loans
given
to
the
members.
that
was
the
old
fashion
conventional
building
and
loan
or
savings
and
loan,
bausparvertrag,
it’s
called
in
german
i
think.
and
this
obviously
is
not
that
kind
of
an
animal.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
also
conceded
that
if
indeed
they
are
securities
for
purposes
of
the
1933
act,
they
are
explicitly
exempted
from
the
registration
requirements
for
that
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
‘34?
justice
potter
stewart
i’ve
had
a
little
trouble
gathering
just
what
is
this
particular
animal
that
we’re
dealing
with
and
then
how
--
and
how
rare
it
is
or
how
common
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
usual
savings
and
loan
underlined
basic
documents.
justice
potter
stewart
a
very
rare
bird
--
is
there
any
kind
of
a
common
bird
in
the
savings
and
loan
business?
justice
potter
stewart
passport?
justice
potter
stewart
which
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
no
capitol
at
all
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
difference.
did
they
say
that
that’s
not
the
difference
between
savings
and
loan
as
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
like
a
callable
stock
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
it
is
callable,
it’s
still
a
stock.
justice
potter
stewart
unlike
a
bank
which
pays
savings
account
interest
with
a
guaranteed
rate,
we
people
get
so
called
earning
at
a
non-guaranteed
rate
although
there’s
an
advertisement
of
the
current
--
justice
potter
stewart
can
these
shares
ever
be
sold
on
the
market
or
that’s
their
value
above
their
base
amount?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
assignable.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
material?
justice
potter
stewart
on
what
appropriate
deal
would
that
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
must
be
because
of
someone
--
justice
potter
stewart
no
broker
would
come
and
register
(inaudible)
possibility
of
trading
--
justice
potter
stewart
nobody?
would
you
as
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
anybody
asked
them
of
their
view
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
haven’t
been
represented
in
any
of
these
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
reports
to
security
owners
or
the
interest
owners,
isn’t
that
--
that’s
covered
by
the
‘34
act
too
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
you
suggest
that
there
could
be
dual
or
conflicting
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
the
bank
board
could
prescribe
by
regulation
what
it
is
these
that
each
association
must
tell
its
perspective
investors.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
for
violation
of
that,
this
might
still
be
a
10(b)
violation
i
might
admit.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
that’s
the
answer
here
then
that’s
why
the
board
isn’t
here.
no
matter
what
the
board
may
do
or
has
done
or
hasn’t
done,
this
after
all
as
investors
or
claimed
investors
if
he
has
the
security.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
a
cause
of
action
for
fraud?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
has
the
home
loan
board
in
any
way
ousted
state
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
even
so,
doesn’t
the
federal
home
loan
board
have
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
what’s
it
got
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
federal
home
loan
board
bank
argument
i
gather
is
its
no
good
as
to
your
association
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it’s
a
security
--
but
if
this
is
ought
to
be
a
security
for
purposes
of
‘34
act,
it
will
be
a
security
for
those
purposes
with
all
the
other
association.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
no
problem
in
the
valic
case
that
there
was
state
administration
of
the
insured
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
what’s
the
difference
here?
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
regulation
doesn’t
mean
that
if
appropriate
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
that
is
--
it
would
mean
there
was
a
priority
only
if
these
petitioners
should
succeed
in
their
action
for
recession,
then
they
would
get
a
hundred
cents
on
every
dollar.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
were
available
and
presumably
this
would
leave
less
or
maybe
nothing
for
the
pre-july
1959
depositors.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
are
15
million
post
july
1959
depositors
and
20
million
pre
of
that
date
deposit,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
about
in
terms
of
amount
of
deposits,
about
the
same
ratio?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
to
amounts.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
one
of
these
brokers
are
dealers
--
what
do
they
get
out
of
it
even
at
the
issuance,
do
they
get
an
underwriter’s
fee
of
some
kind
or
underwriter’s
commission?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
an
original
issuance
i
should
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
‘33
act.
justice
potter
stewart
that
state
action
in
chancery
as
i
have
understood
was
on
behalf
of
all
the
depositors
for
mismanagement
of
the
institution,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
this
action
in
the
state
chancery
court
to
which
reference
has
been
made
and
i
thought
so
because
i
guess
so.
it
was
never
explained.
it
was
an
action
on
behalf
of
all
the
depositors
--
justice
potter
stewart
alleging
mismanagement
of
this
institution
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
is
my
brother
fortas
points
out
as
quite
a
different
cause
of
action
from
one
by
a
purchaser
against
the
seller
of
a
security
for
fraud
and
the
sale
of
that
security.
justice
potter
stewart
are
those
early
associations
unless
i’m
mistaken
also
the
lenders
--
the
only
people
who
borrowed
from
the
association
were
members.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
borrowers.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
to
be
a
prior
member?
do
you
have
to
be
an
investor
in
it
in
order
to
borrow
from
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
true
about
the
earlier
associations
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
--
are
these
institutions
under
illinois
law
and
was
this
institution
limited
and
how
it
could
lend
money
with
limited
to
mortgage
loans
on
residential
real
estate?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
how
are
they
limited?
justice
potter
stewart
mortgage
loans
on
real
property?
justice
potter
stewart
that
first
than
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
everybody
has
--
ordinary
commercial
banks
have
limitations
but
what
i’m
trying
to
get
at
is
what
kind
of
limitations?
justice
potter
stewart
the
kind
i’m
talking
about
mortgage
loans
or
residential
real
property
or
was
it
nothing
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
or
what
is
the
limitation
--
anything
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
may
savings
and
loan
association
loan
money
on
any
property
except
residential
property.
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
apartment
houses.
justice
potter
stewart
they
may
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
but
it
must
be
some
kind
of
residential
property,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
are
shares
in
commercial
bank
securities
under
the
meaning
of
the
1934
securities
exchange
act?
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly
a
commercial
bank
unless
it’s
a
national
bank
is
under
the
strictest
kind
of
state
regulations,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
argument
for
whatever
its
worth
certainly
shouldn’t
--
isn’t
conclusive
is
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
perlman,
are
we
in
this
particular
case
at
least
talking
about
regulation
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
aren’t
we
really
just
talking
about
a
private
right
of
action
in
the
federal
court
for
fraud
or
for
recession
for
--
based
on
fraud?
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
not
talking
about
regulation
by
this
commission?
justice
potter
stewart
--
assigned
bureaucratic
federal
commission
in
competition
with
the
sovereign
state
of
illinois,
we’re
not
talking
about
that
in
this
case
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
we’re
talking
about
is
a
right
of
action
in
the
federal
court
by
a
purchaser
of
one
of
these
things
by
an
investor
against
this
company
because
he
said
i
was
defrauded
and
i
want
my
money
back
and
that’s
all
we’re
talking
about
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
right
of
action
in
the
federal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
by
reason
of
the
1934
securities
exchange
act
--
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
not
talking
about
regulation
by
any
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
valic
--
in
those
cases,
there
was
an
issue
as
to
--
because
there,
as
the
case
was
decided
the
way
in
fact
it
was
decided,
there
was
competitive
regulation
because
of
the
registration
requirements
of
the
1933
act.
you
don’t
have
any
such
thing
as
that
here,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
a
different
point
and
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you’re
complaining
about
that
many
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
they’re
seemed
to
be
in
favor
of
is
you’re
getting
your
money
ratably
with
all
of
the
investors
in
the
institution.
justice
potter
stewart
they
don’t
want
you
to
get
a
100%
on
the
dollar
and
the
other
investors
to
get
zero
on
the
dollar.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
relevance
of
that
date?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice

stewart
mr.

under
‘33
act.
justice
potter
stewart
that
state
action
in
chancery
as
i
have
understood
was
on
behalf
of
all
the
depositors
for
mismanagement
of
the
institution,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
this
action
in
the
state
chancery
court
to
which
reference
has
been
made
and
i
thought
so
because
i
guess
so.
it
was
never
explained.
it
was
an
action
on
behalf
of
all
the
depositors
--
justice
potter
stewart
alleging
mismanagement
of
this
institution
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
is
my
brother
fortas
points
out
as
quite
a
different
cause
of
action
from
one
by
a
purchaser
against
the
seller
of
a
security
for
fraud
and
the
sale
of
that
security.
justice
potter
stewart
are
those
early
associations
unless
i’m
mistaken
also
the
lenders
--
the
only
people
who
borrowed
from
the
association
were
members.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
borrowers.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
to
be
a
prior
member?
do
you
have
to
be
an
investor
in
it
in
order
to
borrow
from
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
true
about
the
earlier
associations
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
--
are
these
institutions
under
illinois
law
and
was
this
institution
limited
and
how
it
could
lend
money
with
limited
to
mortgage
loans
on
residential
real
estate?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
how
are
they
limited?
justice
potter
stewart
mortgage
loans
on
real
property?
justice
potter
stewart
that
first
than
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
everybody
has
--
ordinary
commercial
banks
have
limitations
but
what
i’m
trying
to
get
at
is
what
kind
of
limitations?
justice
potter
stewart
the
kind
i’m
talking
about
mortgage
loans
or
residential
real
property
or
was
it
nothing
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
or
what
is
the
limitation
--
anything
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
may
savings
and
loan
association
loan
money
on
any
property
except
residential
property.
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
apartment
houses.
justice
potter
stewart
they
may
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
but
it
must
be
some
kind
of
residential
property,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
are
shares
in
commercial
bank
securities
under
the
meaning
of
the
1934
securities
exchange
act?
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly
a
commercial
bank
unless
it’s
a
national
bank
is
under
the
strictest
kind
of
state
regulations,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
argument
for
whatever
its
worth
certainly
shouldn’t
--
isn’t
conclusive
is
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
perlman,
are
we
in
this
particular
case
at
least
talking
about
regulation
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
aren’t
we
really
just
talking
about
a
private
right
of
action
in
the
federal
court
for
fraud
or
for
recession
for
--
based
on
fraud?
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
not
talking
about
regulation
by
this
commission?
justice
potter
stewart
--
assigned
bureaucratic
federal
commission
in
competition
with
the
sovereign
state
of
illinois,
we’re
not
talking
about
that
in
this
case
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
we’re
talking
about
is
a
right
of
action
in
the
federal
court
by
a
purchaser
of
one
of
these
things
by
an
investor
against
this
company
because
he
said
i
was
defrauded
and
i
want
my
money
back
and
that’s
all
we’re
talking
about
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
right
of
action
in
the
federal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
by
reason
of
the
1934
securities
exchange
act
--
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
not
talking
about
regulation
by
any
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
valic
--
in
those
cases,
there
was
an
issue
as
to
--
because
there,
as
the
case
was
decided
the
way
in
fact
it
was
decided,
there
was
competitive
regulation
because
of
the
registration
requirements
of
the
1933
act.
you
don’t
have
any
such
thing
as
that
here,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
a
different
point
and
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you’re
complaining
about
that
many
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
they’re
seemed
to
be
in
favor
of
is
you’re
getting
your
money
ratably
with
all
of
the
investors
in
the
institution.
justice
potter
stewart
they
don’t
want
you
to
get
a
100%
on
the
dollar
and
the
other
investors
to
get
zero
on
the
dollar.
