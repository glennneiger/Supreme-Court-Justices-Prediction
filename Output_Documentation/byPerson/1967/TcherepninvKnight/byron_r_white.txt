that

justice
byron

white
well,
i
know
what
it
is.
it
may
not
be
right
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
a
decision
that
it
is
a
security
will
ensure
the
fact
that
broker
dealers
will
be
covered
by
the
‘34

you
have
a

mr.

what
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank

it
seems
to
me
they
had
a
rather
broad
dispensation
to

perhaps
to
issue
rules
with

to
the
issuance
of
the

just

we’re

justice

you
don’t
concede
i
take
it
that
this
interest
as
a

even
for
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
‘33
act?
justice
byron

well
that’s
act
’34.
justice
byron

that’s
right

for

do
you
agree
that
it’s
the

there’s
interest
in
the
security?
justice

it
would
be
against
the

it
would
be
a
charge
against
the

you
know
why
