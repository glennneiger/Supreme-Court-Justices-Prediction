mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
these
associations
as
mr.
shure
has
said,
the
holders
of
shares
have
the
equity
position.
they
are
corporations
consequently
the
nearest
analogy
to
the
position
of
these
people
is
that
of
shareholders.
as
judge
cummings
pointed
out
in
the
illinois
statutes
expressly
provide
that
they
are
not
creditors.
they
have
a
certain
unusual
characteristics.
they
are
so
long
as
the
association
is
operating
normally
and
profitably
redeemable
and
therefore
they
are
not
traded
in
the
markets
because
the
investor
who
wants
to
sell
instead
just
redeems
and
the
amounts
of
which
he
redeems
is
fixed
so
there
would
really
be
no
point
in
trading
them
in
the
market
so
long
as
the
association
was
operating
profitably.
when
the
association
gets
in
trouble,
trading
may
develop.
they
are
nonnegotiable
for
the
same
reason
that
they
don’t
trade
because
the
redeemability
features
no
need
to
have
them
traded.
now
mr.
shure
referred
to
four
cases
in
this
court
which
considered
the
definition
of
security
under
the
securities
act.
i
think
that
those
cases
taking
in
conjunction
not
only
show
that
this
is
a
security
but
refute
each
of
the
contentions
that
the
respondents
make
that
they
shouldn’t
be
deemed
to
be
shares
because
they’re
redeemable
for
example.
well,
the
variable
annuity
and
flexible
fund
were
both
redeemable
at
the
option
of
the
holder
during
the
pay
in
period
that
they
are
not
traded
in
the
markets.
well,
the
orange
groves
interests
and
oil
leases
involved
in
howey
and
joiner
were
not
traded
on
any
exchange
or
in
any
organized
market.
further,
the
cannons
of
construction
used
by
this
court
in
those
opinions
and
in
other
cases
such
as
the
capital
gains
case,
the
effect
that
these
statutes
are
to
be
broadly
construed
that
the
fact
that
an
instrument
falls
that
this
broader
features
of
this
definition
are
not
to
be
used
to
cut
down
the
specific
features
and
conversely
the
specific
features
do
not
limit
the
broader
features.
all
of
these,
i
think
demonstrate
that
this
is
a
security
at
least
for
purposes
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
with
sufficient
clarity
that
i
don’t
think
that
is
really
contested
anymore.
the
legislative
history
of
the
‘33
act
shows
that
congress
expressly
considered
the
status
of
savings
and
loan
shares
and
determined
that
they
would
be
exempted
from
registration
but
included
under
the
fraud
provisions
and
the
savings
and
loan
industry
acquiesced.
in
fact
they
seemed
to
think
this
was
a
good
idea.
they
didn’t
want
to
be
registered
because
of
the
expense
but
they
did
want
federal
protections
against
fraud.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
i
don’t
believe
it
is.
we
are
talking
about
withdrawable
shares
of
a
savings
and
loan
which
has
only
one
class.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
that’s
right.
you’re
right.
there
are
quite
a
number
of
different
types
of
organizations
that
are
sometimes
called
savings
and
loans
and
they
have
rather
different
stocks.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
i’m
thinking
about
this
particular
type
of
association,
this
characteristic
is
that
as
far
as
i
know,
it
didn’t
issue
any
kind
of
shares
except
one
class
of
withdrawable
shares
and
maybe
certain
loans
that
it
made.
it
didn’t
limit
itself
to
making
loans
to
those
who
had
accounts
with
it
but
solicited
accounts
widely
all
over
the
country
and
could
invest
not
only
in
mortgages
but
in
other
things.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
provided
it
qualifies
where
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it
and
i’m
not
an
expert
in
savings
and
loan
insurance
and
i
may
be
wrong.
if
the
association
gets
into
trouble,
the
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation
will
arranged
to
work
things
out
for
the
investor
either
by
giving
him
shares
in
another
association
or
giving
him
some
other
kind
of
interest
or
ultimately,
it
would
have
necessary
pay
him
in
cash
but
he
doesn’t
get
his
cash
right
away
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
the
base
amount?
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
i’m
not
sure
how
they
handle
interest.
i
think
they
get
something
on
that
too.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
as
i
was
trying
to
say,
these
interests
with
this
particular
--
involved
in
this
particular
case
seemed
to
me
to
be
so
clearly
securities
for
purposes
of
the
securities
act
that
it
seems
to
be
almost
conceded.
now
as
to
the
securities
exchange
act,
respondents
attempted
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
that
is
true
and
the
same
is
true
incidentally
as
to
the
registration
requirements
in
the
securities
exchange
act.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
the
‘34
act.
they
are
excluded
form
that
also.
there
seems
to
be
a
suggestion,
the
securities
exchange
act
is
somehow
different
and
narrower
than
the
securities
act
and
the
same
broad
construction
should
not
be
applied
to
that
act.
that
seems
to
be
suggested
also
in
the
majority
opinion
below.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
suggestion
has
no
basis.
these
two
acts
were
passed
by
the
same
congress
on
the
same
term
--
no.
same
congress
and
basically
the
basis
of
the
same
investigation
and
in
response
to
the
same
events,
the
stock
market
depression
and
the
words
of
the
definition
were
impertinent
part
i
think
substantially
identical.
the
only
difference
of
which
anything
has
been
made
is
the
concept
of
evidence
of
indebtedness
used
in
the
‘33
act
and
not
the
exchange
act
to
which
i
ought
to
return.
it
seems
to
me
inconceivable
under
these
circumstances
that
congress
--
if
the
congress
had
intended
the
same
words,
stock
transferable
share,
investment
contract,
certificate
of
interest
or
participation
in
a
profit
sharing
agreement
and
so
forth
were
to
mean
something
different
in
the
exchange
act
that
they
meant
in
the
securities
act
that
there
would
have
been
some
hint
of
this
somewhere
in
the
statue
or
on
the
legislative
history.
there
is
none.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
these
words
somehow
mean
something
different
in
the
act
that
followed
a
year
later.
incidentally,
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
los
angeles
trustee
case
apparently
felt
that
once
it
had
shown
that
the
real
estate
interests
they
are
involved
which
where
participations
and
mortgages
were
securities,
investment
contracts
for
purposes
of
the
securities
act,
it
necessarily
followed
that
they
were
securities
for
purposes
of
the
securities
exchange
act
and
granted
the
decree
accordingly.
the
structure
of
the
two
acts
is
based
--
as
here
pertinent
is
basically
the
same.
you
will
have
a
broad
definition
of
security
including
practically
all
media
of
investment
evidenced
by
an
intangible
except
the
direct
ownership
of
property
and
even
that
sometimes
is
in
howey
followed
by
appropriate
exemptions
from
the
right
registration
or
regulatory
provisions.
the
savings
and
loan
shares
vary
of
a
certain
type
were
exempted
from
the
registration
but
not
the
fraud
provisions
in
the
securities
act
and
again
in
the
exchange
act
when
the
coverage
of
the
exchange
act
was
broaden
to
include
securities
not
traded
on
exchanges.
the
failure
to
include
evidence
of
indebtedness
in
the
definition
in
the
exchange
act
is
i
think
irrelevant
for
two
reasons.
first
because
as
judge
cummings
had
shown,
this
is
not
an
evidence
of
indebtedness.
there
is
no
debtor-creditor
relationship
and
in
any
event,
it
falls
within
the
other
terms.
i
think
probably,
the
significance
although
the
congress
didn’t
say
of
taking
out
and
not
putting
evidence
of
indebtedness
in
is
probable
that
--
it
is
probable
that
that
term
was
so
broad
as
to
include
things
that
are
not
investment
media
at
all
lik
doctor
bill
which
says
you
are
owed
money
or
an
i
owe
you
or
a
cashier’s
check
or
something
like
that.
in
the
--
none
of
the
cases
which
i
have
referred
to,
the
four
cases
referred
and
under
the
securities
act
which
we
think
govern
here
involved
the
term
investment
contract
and
none
of
them
--
i
mean
evidence
of
indebtedness
and
non-relied
on
it.
finally,
there
is
no
policy
reason
to
exclude
this
type
of
share
from
the
protection
of
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
exchange
act
that
is
not
equally
applicable
to
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
securities
act
which
as
we
have
seen
the
congress
expressly
did
not
do.
to
read
these
interest
out
of
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
exchange
act
would
have
certain
anomalous
consequences.
it
would
mean
that
fraud
in
the
sale
of
such
interest
would
be
prohibited
by
federal
law
but
not
fraud
in
the
purchase
because
the
‘33
act
only
reaches
fraud
in
the
sale
of
a
security.
the
congress
brought
in
the
‘34
act
to
include
fraud
in
the
sale
or
in
any
transaction
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
the
commission’s
authority
to
register
and
regulate
broker
dealers
who
deal
in
these
issues
would
be
eliminated
and
there
seems
--
it
has
existed
from
the
beginning
for
it
has
been
the
commission’s
consistent
administrative
construction
ever
since
1934
that
these
interests
are
securities
for
purposes
of
securities
exchange
act
as
well
as
for
purposes
of
a
securities
act,
very
few
courts
have
had
to
consider
this
question.
no
one
has
ever
seemed
to
think
it
required
extensive
litigation
before
this
case
and
those
instances
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
court
did
have
occasion
to
consider
this
question.
they
have
all
proceeded
upon
the
assumption
at
least
that
these
are
securities
for
purposes
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
here,
we
are
dealing
both
for
purposes
of
the
securities
act
and
for
purposes
of
the
securities
exchange
act
with
the
fraud
provisions
and
nothing
more.
no
greater
federal
regulation.
congress
has
never
thought
that
the
existence
of
state
regulation
justifies
exemption
from
the
fraud
provisions.
indeed
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
securities
act
applied
by
necessary
implication
to
state
securities
themselves,
state
bonds.
the
congress
insofar
as
fraud
is
concerned,
intended
to
broaden
and
improve
and
provide
greater
protections
in
this
exchange
act
and
to
determine
that
it
would
have
provided
in
the
securities
act
and
the
contention
that
somehow
the
exchange
act
is
to
be
interpreted
more
narrowly
insofar
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
no.
the
way
both
these
statutes
provide
that
they
don’t
eliminate
any
state
remedy
conversely.
their
remedy
is
an
addition
to
any
state
remedy
on
state
remedy
doesn’t
preempt
them
either.
the
two
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
it
depends
on
what
the
state
law
is.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
i
haven’t
made
any
great
study
of
the
state
law.
i
don’t
--
i’m
not
sure
what
remedy
these
people
would
have
had
under
illinois
state
law.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
that
is
right
but
i
don’t
think
you
have
to
reach
all
of
that
question
yet
because
you’re
really
asked
whether
this
is
a
security.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
these
associations
as
mr.
shure
has
said,
the
holders
of
shares
have
the
equity
position.
they
are
corporations
consequently
the
nearest
analogy
to
the

of
these

is
that

so
there
would
really

so

when
the

may
develop.
they
are
nonnegotiable
for
the
same
reason
that
they
don’t
trade
because
the
redeemability
features
no
need
to
have

now
mr.
shure
referred
to
four
cases
in
this
court
which
considered
the
definition
of
security
under
the
securities
act.
i
think
that
those
cases
taking
in

not
only
show
that

is

but
refute
each

the
contentions
that

were
not

further,
the
cannons

this

all
of

a.
loomis,

that’s
right.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
that
is
true
and
the
same
is
true
incidentally
as
to
the
registration
requirements
in
the
securities
exchange
act.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
the
‘34
act.
they
are
excluded
form
that
also.
there
seems
to
be
a
suggestion,
the
securities
exchange
act
is
somehow
different
and
narrower
than
the
securities
act
and
the
same
broad
construction
should
not
be
applied
to
that
act.
that
seems
to
be
suggested
also
in
the
majority
opinion
below.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
suggestion
has
no
basis.
these
two
acts
were
passed
by
the
same
congress
on
the
same
term
--
no.
same
congress
and
basically
the
basis
of
the
same
investigation
and
in
response
to
the
same
events,
the
stock
market
depression
and
the
words
of
the
definition
were
impertinent
part
i
think
substantially
identical.
the
only
difference
of
which
anything
has
been
made
is
the
concept
of
evidence
of
indebtedness
used
in
the
‘33
act
and
not
the
exchange
act
to
which
i
ought
to
return.
it
seems
to
me
inconceivable
under
these
circumstances
that
congress
--
if
the
congress
had
intended
the
same
words,
stock
transferable
share,
investment
contract,
certificate
of
interest
or
participation
in
a
profit
sharing
agreement
and
so
forth
were
to
mean
something
different
in
the
exchange
act
that
they
meant
in
the
securities
act
that
there
would
have
been
some
hint
of
this
somewhere
in
the
statue
or
on
the
legislative
history.
there
is
none.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
these
words
somehow
mean
something
different
in
the
act
that
followed
a
year
later.
incidentally,
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
los
angeles
trustee
case
apparently
felt
that
once
it
had
shown
that
the
real
estate
interests
they
are
involved
which
where
participations
and
mortgages
were
securities,
investment
contracts
for
purposes
of
the
securities
act,
it
necessarily
followed
that
they
were
securities
for
purposes
of
the
securities
exchange
act
and
granted
the
decree
accordingly.
the
structure
of
the
two
acts
is
based
--
as
here
pertinent
is
basically
the
same.
you
will
have
a
broad
definition
of
security
including
practically
all
media
of
investment
evidenced
by
an
intangible
except
the
direct
ownership
of
property
and
even
that
sometimes
is
in
howey
followed
by
appropriate
exemptions
from
the
right
registration
or
regulatory
provisions.
the
savings
and
loan
shares
vary
of
a
certain
type
were
exempted
from
the
registration
but
not
the
fraud
provisions
in
the
securities
act
and
again
in
the
exchange
act
when
the
coverage
of
the
exchange
act
was
broaden
to
include
securities
not
traded
on
exchanges.
the
failure
to
include
evidence
of
indebtedness
in
the
definition
in
the
exchange
act
is
i
think
irrelevant
for
two
reasons.
first
because
as
judge
cummings
had
shown,
this
is
not
an
evidence
of
indebtedness.
there
is
no
debtor-creditor
relationship
and
in
any
event,
it
falls
within
the
other
terms.
i
think
probably,
the
significance
although
the
congress
didn’t
say
of
taking
out
and
not
putting
evidence
of
indebtedness
in
is
probable
that
--
it
is
probable
that
that
term
was
so
broad
as
to
include
things
that
are
not
investment
media
at
all
lik
doctor
bill
which
says
you
are
owed
money
or
an
i
owe
you
or
a
cashier’s
check
or
something
like
that.
in
the
--
none
of
the
cases
which
i
have
referred
to,
the
four
cases
referred
and
under
the
securities
act
which
we
think
govern
here
involved
the
term
investment
contract
and
none
of
them
--
i
mean
evidence
of
indebtedness
and
non-relied
on
it.
finally,
there
is
no
policy
reason
to
exclude
this
type
of
share
from
the
protection
of
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
exchange
act
that
is
not
equally
applicable
to
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
securities
act
which
as
we
have
seen
the
congress
expressly
did
not
do.
to
read
these
interest
out
of
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
exchange
act
would
have
certain
anomalous
consequences.
it
would
mean
that
fraud
in
the
sale
of
such
interest
would
be
prohibited
by
federal
law
but
not
fraud
in
the
purchase
because
the
‘33
act
only
reaches
fraud
in
the
sale
of
a
security.
the
congress
brought
in
the
‘34
act
to
include
fraud
in
the
sale
or
in
any
transaction
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
the
commission’s
authority
to
register
and
regulate
broker
dealers
who
deal
in
these
issues
would
be
eliminated
and
there
seems
--
it
has
existed
from
the
beginning
for
it
has
been
the
commission’s
consistent
administrative
construction
ever
since
1934
that
these
interests
are
securities
for
purposes
of
securities
exchange
act
as
well
as
for
purposes
of
a
securities
act,
very
few
courts
have
had
to
consider
this
question.
no
one
has
ever
seemed
to
think
it
required
extensive
litigation
before
this
case
and
those
instances
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
court
did
have
occasion
to
consider
this
question.
they
have
all
proceeded
upon
the
assumption
at
least
that
these
are
securities
for
purposes
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
here,
we
are
dealing
both
for
purposes
of
the
securities
act
and
for
purposes
of
the
securities
exchange
act
with
the
fraud
provisions
and
nothing
more.
no
greater
federal
regulation.
congress
has
never
thought
that
the
existence
of
state
regulation
justifies
exemption
from
the
fraud
provisions.
indeed
the
fraud
provisions
of
the
securities
act
applied
by
necessary
implication
to
state
securities
themselves,
state
bonds.
the
congress
insofar
as
fraud
is
concerned,
intended
to
broaden
and
improve
and
provide
greater
protections
in
this
exchange
act
and
to
determine
that
it
would
have
provided
in
the
securities
act
and
the
contention
that
somehow
the
exchange
act
is
to
be
interpreted
more
narrowly
insofar
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
no.
the
way
both
these
statutes
provide
that
they
don’t
eliminate
any
state
remedy
conversely.
their
remedy
is
an
addition
to
any
state
remedy
on
state
remedy
doesn’t
preempt
them
either.
the
two
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
it
depends
on
what
the
state
law
is.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
i
haven’t
made
any
great
study
of
the
state
law.
i
don’t
--
i’m
not
sure
what
remedy
these
people
would
have
had
under
illinois
state
law.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
that
is
right
but
i
don’t
think
you
have
to
reach
all
of
that
question
yet
because
you’re
really
asked
whether
this
is
a
security.
