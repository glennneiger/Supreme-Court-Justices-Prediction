with

that
this

at
that
time
and
then
using
the
testimony
she
got
from

chief

did
this
woman
--
didn't
this
woman
admit
that
she
have
told
the
petitioner
that
hayton
have
blown
the
lead
off

case?
chief
justice

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
mr.
--
i
understood
mr.
bailey
have
said
she
had
at
that
time
and
make
a
statement
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
she
said,
getting
back
to
the
miller
case,
arthwell
hayton
came

top
off

case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
she
admitted
telling
her
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
a
lie,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
griffin,
i
still
can't
understand
how
you
can
argue
to
us,
that
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
state
was
proper
and
should
not
be
condemned
by
this
court
after
you
have
written
a
letter
with
just
--
within
a
less
--
less
than
a
year
ago
in
which
you
said,
the
respondent
did
not
argue
and
does
not
now
advocate
the
conduct
to
the
sheriff
and
the
undercover
agent
is
set
out
of
page
6
of
petitioner's
reply
brief
was
proper
and
not
unconstitutional.
the
respondent
hereby
goes
on
record
as
condemning
such
conduct.
now,
i
haven't
heard
you
say
one
word
that
it
is
condemnatory
of
any
practice
of
the
sheriff
or
the
undercover
or
anybody
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i'm
not
talking
about
the
procedure
or
the
manner
in
which
she
came
in
to
the
case
but
i
haven't
heard
anything
from
you
to
the
effect
that
the
conduct
of
a
sheriff
was
unconstitutional
and
that
you
go
on
record
as
condemning
it.
now,
what
conduct
to
the
sheriff
do
you
admit
is
unconstitutional
and
what
do
you
condemn
as
far
he
is
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
thought
your
position
on
that
was
that
though
this
woman
was
just
sent
in
there
by
the
sheriff
to
listen,
not
to
talk
or
not
to
elucidate
any
information
from
the
petitioner.
what
would
that
be
set
in
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
what
you
said
before
that
her
instructions
were
not
to
ask
anything
but
just
to
listen.
chief
justice
earl
warren

you
write
this

of
