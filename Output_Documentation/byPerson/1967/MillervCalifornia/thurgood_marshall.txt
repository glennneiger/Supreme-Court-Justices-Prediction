if
it's
possible
that
she
was
there
after
the
complaint,
can't
we
assume
that

this
one
day.
justice
thurgood

oh!
was

an

justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood

can
it
also
be
assumed
that

justice
thurgood

well,
mr.

she
did
have
counsel
actually
in
the

the
expressed
purpose
of
evading
that
law
here.
justice

well,
how
can
you
justify

deliberately?
justice
thurgood

didn't
one
--
didn't
the
prosecutor
attorney
have
a

positive
duty
not

you
could
have.
justice
thurgood

even
with
a
lawyer
outside,
doing

you
could
go
beyond
that
and
bug
the
cell
and
use
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
use
it.
justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
was
a
discussion,
was

justice
thurgood

can
i
assume
that
a

will
say
something,
will

on
something.
can
i
assume

the

told
the
defense
counsel,
"i'm
going
to
testify
that
your

he

then
he
goes
on

the

day
and
the
defense
counsel
doesn't
object
and
the
witness
under
oath
testified
that
the
