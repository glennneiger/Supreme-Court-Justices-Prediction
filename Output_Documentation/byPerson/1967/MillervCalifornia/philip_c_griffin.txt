mr.
philip
c.
griffin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
the
position
of
the
state
of
california
that
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
there
was
no
violation
of
massiah
and
escobedo.
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
i
have
written
a
letter
in
this
case
condemning
certain
activity
of
the
undercover
agent
in
this
case.
i
wrote
that
letter
because
certain
of
the
conduct,
it
was
not
shown
to
have
evoked
any
of
the
comments
introduced
into
evidence
was
not
approved
by
our
office
and
certainly
wouldn't
be
approved
in
this
day
and
age.
but
our
argument
is
basically
that
we
are
confined
to
precedent
and
the
precedent
is
either
massiah
or
escobedo.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
the
letter
is
not
part
of
the
record.
it
was
in
response
to
the
reply
brief
and
it
was
not
received
by
the
court.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
only
that
certain
sentence
is
in
the
brief
of
petitioner.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
page
13.
now,
the
conduct
that
was
referred
to
in
that
letter
was
the
conduct
that
was
brought
out
by
defense
counsel
on
cross-examination
of
the
undercover
agent.
this
was
not
part
of
the
evidence.
and
the
defense
in
that
cross-examination
never
developed
the
fact
that
the
statements
that
the
prosecution
introduced
into
evidence
were
provoked
by
this
conduct
of
the
undercover
agent.
the
prosecution
initially
put
the
witness
on
the
stand
and
asked
the
circumstances
under
which
she
had
been
placed
in
the
jail
cell.
and
immediately
thereafter,
asked
her
if
she
had
any
conversations
with
the
defendant.
there
was
no
question
regarding
--
questioning
of
the
witness
regarding
a
process
of
interrogation.
the
witness
merely
testified
as
the
certain
statements
made
by
the
petitioner
in
the
fact
that
she
had
been
separated
from
her
husband,
they
had
reconciled.
she
respected
him
but
she
loved
arthwell
hayton
and
still
loved
him
and
was
going
to
europe
with
the
insurance
money.
now,
before
this
evidence
was
introduced,
the
defense
took
the
witness
on
voir
dire
examination
and
established
one
that
she
had
not
been
warned
of
her
constitutional
rights
by
the
undercover
agent
nor
have
the
undercover
agent
told
her
that
she
was
working
for
the
police.
at
that
point,
the
voir
dire
examination
was
terminated.
there
was
no
objection
to
the
evidence
and
whatsoever.
instead,
the
prosecution
was
permitted
to
go
ahead,
introduce
the
statements
and
then
the
prosecution
promptly
closed
and
did
not
have
any
extended
examination
on
this
subject.
the
cross-examination
was
commenced
by
the
defense
counsel
and
he
developed
in
his
first
questions
that
this
undercover
agent
had
been
instructed
when
she
was
placed
in
the
jail
cell
and
it
should
be
emphasized
that
she
was
placed
in
this
jail
cell
prior
to
any
charges
having
been
filed
in
the
court
of
law
against
her.
the
undercover
agent
was
in
the
jail
cell
prior
to
any
complaint
or
indictment.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
she
was
not
sure
what
day
she
left.
that
--
the
record
is
vague
in
that
respect.
the
record
is
vague
as
to
how
long
she
stayed.
it
is
possible
that
she
was
there
following
the
complaint
in
the
admissible
court
which
complaint
was
ought
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
she
was
not
an
experienced
policewoman,
she
was
an
undercover
agent.
there
was
no
evidence
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
she
had
--
she
had
been
used
on
prior
occasions.
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
her
experience
in
the
record.
it
could
be
assumed
that
this
was
her
first
case.
as
far
as
this
record
is
concern.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
it
could
be
except
that
she
had
worked
with
narcotics.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes,
she
had
worked
narcotics
undercover
(voice
overlap)
in
narcotics.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
as
a
narcotics
undercover
agent,
yes.
i
was
referring
to
experience
as
being
an
interrogator
but
there's
just
no
indication
that
she
had
done
this
particular
type
of
undercover
work
before.
the
defense
counsel
developed
immediately
that
she
had
initially
instructed
only
to
listen.
ultimately,
she
was
requested
by
the
sheriff
to
bring
certain
matters
to
the
attention
of
petitioner
and
that
is
the
conduct
that
was
referred
to
in
my
letter
where
she
brought
a
newspaper
clipping
up
and
showed
it
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
just
a
brief
quote
for
that
letter.
it
was
referring
to
this
conduct
make
no
contention
to
this
conduct
can
be
constitutionally
permitted.
but
the
point
we
wish
to
emphasize
and
first,
i
should
point
out
that
mr.
bailey
was
asked
if
there
was
any
contradiction
of
the
record.
the
undercover
agent
did
not
testify
that
she
said
to
the
petitioner
that
publicity
is
ruining
you.
she
was
not
able
to
testify
that
she
had
made
that
statement.
she
was
able
to
testify
only
that
in
her
prior
discussion
with
defense
counsel
and
that
was
the
evening
before
she
took
the
witness
stand
that
she
might
have
said
something
like
that
but
she
did
not
remember
having
said
made
any
statement
with
regard
to
the
newspaper
article.
and
the
rest
of
this
conduct
that
is
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
if
the
statements
had
been
elicited
by
this
type
of
procedure,
this
would
be
a
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
this
would
be
a
violation
of
miranda.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
before
the
indictment
--
today.
this
case
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
this
case
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
well,
at
that
time,
it
would
not
have
been
violation
because
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
at
cali
--
in
california
the
first
dorado
was
decided
in
august
of
that
year
and
had
included
the
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
our
court
which
has
decided
another
case
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
well,
assuming
--
assuming
that
there
had
been
a
charge
in
pleading,
it
might
have
been.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
an
indictment.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes,
the
charge
was
in
the
municipal
court
in
form
of
a
complaint.
she
was
arraigned
on
the
13th.
now,
the
undercover
agent
later
report
on
the
12th
of
october
and
of
course
she
was
making
oral
reports
throughout
her
time
in
this
jail
cell.
and
these
reports
were
ultimately
written
up
by
another
secretary
after
they
have
been
paneled
through
the
undercover
agent's
connection.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
although
--
we
have
no
california
decision.
we
have
people
versus
arguello
which
involved
in
indictment
and
the
questioning
in
that
case
was
in
a
jail
cell
after
the
indictment.
we
have
no
california
case
but
in
view
of
the
circumstances
of
the
defendant
being
represented
by
counsel
having
been
arraigned
in
court,
we
would
--
we
would
not
distinguish
massiah
on
that
ground.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
i
--
no.
not
--
not
--
not
in
this
day
and
age.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
had
the
record
--
have
there
been
a
proper
objection
and
development
at
this
point
of
the
time
to
show
that
this
undercover
agent
had
elicited
these
statements.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
at
the
time
that
the
prosecutor
introduced
this
evidence
your
honor,
he
was
under
the
impression
that
this
witness
had
not
done
any
interrogation
of
the
petitioner.
he
was
under
the
impression
that
this
was
a
listening
post
only.
this
is
the
statement
that
he
made
to
the
judge
when
this,
when
the
old
question
was
raised.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
at
the
time
this
was
decided,
there
was
no
privacy
in
a
jail
cell.
no
privacy
whatsoever.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
we
could
place
an
agent
in
the
jail
cell
section
to
overhear
anything
said
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
and
use
it.
as
long
as
it's
not
elicited
by
an
interrogation
because
we're
interested
in
protecting
the
right
against
self-incrimination
from
interrogation
and
not
against
overhearing
voluntary
and
spontaneous
statements.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
my
whole
point
is
that
on
this
record,
your
honor,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
there
was
any
elicitation
of
these
statements.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
there's
no
showing
that
there
was
a
discussion
when
these
statements
were
brought
out.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
we
can
assume
that
there
was
a
conversation,
your
honor,
but
now
the
point
is
whether
there
is
a
duty
upon
the
part
of
the
defense
to
establish
a
record
showing
this
conversation.
that
is
our
point.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
not
if
she
didn't
interrogate
the
petitioner;
if
she
sat
there
silently
and
listened
as
she
was
have
been
instructed
to
do.
later
on,
her
instructions
changed
and
that's
when
there
might
have
been
a
violation.
but
again,
the
record
is
inadequate
to
show
that
the
things
done
by
this
undercover
agent
elicited
any
of
these
statements.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
she
made
periodic
reports.
i'm
not
certain
the
record
establishes
daily
reports.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
there's
no
showing
that
this
was
in
her
report.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
there
was
no
showing
that
this
was
in
her
report.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
i've
never
seen
her
report
and
there's
no
--
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
her
written
reports
but
what
is
in
the
record
is
the
fact
that
these
reports
were
available
to
defense
counsel
before
the
witness
was
called
to
the
stand
and--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
the
prosecutor
has
had
the
report
obviously
but
that
point
is
we
don't
know
what
was
in
that
report.
we
do
know
that
defense
counsel
interviewed
the
witness
the
evening
before
she
was
placed
on
the
witness
stand.
and
this
was
between
the
time
that
there
had
been
a
discussion
in
the
trial
court
chambers
as
to
this
evidence.
this
is
a
point
that
was
brought
out,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
objection
when
the
chamber
discussion
started,
the
witness
had
been
placed
on
the
stand
and
the
defense
counsel
asked
to
go
into
chambers
and
discussed
this
witness'
testimony.
proceedings
adjourned
to
chambers
where
he
had
an
opportunity
to
make
an
objection
if
he
wanted
to
make
one.
at
that
time,
he
did
not
make
an
objection.
his
statement
was,
"i
am
going
to
represent
to
the
court
also,
that
any
testimony
of
this
witness
concerning
any
statement
made
by
my
client
would
be
in
violation
of
the
rule
in
the
dorado
case."
and
then
proceeded
a
discussion
of
the
fact
that
it
would
be
in
violation
and
that
he
hadn't
had
an
opportunity
to
interview
this
witness
as
on
pages
42
through
47
of
the
appendix.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes,
he
was
entitled
to
--
he
was
promised
an
opportunity
by
the
district
attorney
to
interview
this
witness.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
there
would
have
been
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
to
permit
that
the
prosecution
witness
to
be
interviewed.
he
would
be
entitled
only
to
the
witness'
statements
after
she
had
taken
the
stand
and
use
them
or
if
there
is
a
showing
of
a
need
for
discovery.
now,
at
the
time
that
this
discussion
was
taken
place,
the
principal
concern
with
the
defense
counsel
was
an
opportunity
to
interview
this
witness
and
the
trial
court
said
that
the
witness
should
be
withdrawn
and
have
an
opportunity
to
interview
her
and
then
the
trial
court
stated
that
she
should
be
placed
on
the
stand
and
certain
foundational
matters
be
arrived
at
and
that
proper
objection
made
to
her
testimony.
properly,
the
proceedings
end.
there
was
no
ruling
on
any
objection,
there
was
no
objection
made
in
chambers.
there's
ample
opportunity
to
ask
the
court
for
permission
to
question
this
witness
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
determine
if
there
was
any
foundation
for
an
objection
in
the
basis
of
massiah,
escobedo
or
dorado
in
california.
this
opportunity
was
not
requested
and
it
is
the
law
of
california
that
that
opportunity
is
available
to
any
counsel.
now,
the
excuse
has
been
brought
forth
that
the
reason
for
a
failure
to
object
the
following
day
was
a
fear
that
the
jury
would
feel
the
evidence
was
being
concealed.
the
following
day
of
counsel
had
made
a
request
for
this
witness
to
be
examined
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
court
would
have
been
obliged
to
grant
it.
there
is
no
request
whatsoever
for
an
opportunity
to
do
this
and
there
was
no
objection
on
the
part
of
the
defense
even
after
the
prosecution
commence
to
examine
the
witness.
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
obvious
after
this
witness
had
testified
that
the
reason
the
counsel
determined
not
to
object
was
a
tactical
one.
he
had
learned
the
evening
before
the
context
with
this
witness'
testimony.
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
was
going
to
be
an
absolute
of
court
with
the
testimony
of
previous
witnesses
and
the
previous
statements
to
the
police
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
this
statement
as
i
indicated
was
made
by
the
court
that
he
did
indicate
an
objection
that
would
have
to
be
made
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
i'm
talking
about
an
examination
of
this
witness
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
lay
the
foundation
that
there
was
a
violation,
and
once
that
foundation
was
laid,
it
is
problematic
on
whether
the
judge
would
have
required
the
witness
to
resume
the
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
merely
for
the
formality
of
an
objection.
that
would
be
a
complete
waste
of
time
if
the
foundation
were
laid
that
this
was
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
the
judge
would
have
immediately
ruled
that
we
are
not
going
to
consider
this
evidence.
it's
not
going
to
be
offered
and
an
objection
would
be
sustained.
this
opportunity
that
was
always
present
was
never
availed
of
by
the
defense
and
that
is
why
i
maintained
that
this
was
a
tactical
decision
to
permit
this
evidence.
based
upon
the
fact
that
this
witness
would
corroborate
petitioner
in
every
statement
that
she'd
made
to
the
police
that
this
was
an
accidental
fire
and
that
although
she
loved
another
man,
she
had
given
up
any
intention
whatsoever
of
marrying
him
and
that
was
the
only
issue
at
the
time
of
the
trial
on
motive
whether
she
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
i
don't
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no.
she
did
not
say
that
to
her.
fisk's
testimony
was
very
brief
on
that
subject.
it's
just
a
question
of
loving
mr.
hayton
and
still
loving
him.
the
question
of
marriage
was
never
even
discussed
by
agent
fisk.
and
this
--
the
district
attorney
an
argument,
the
argument
is
set
forth
in
our
appendix,
never
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
still
love
arthwell
hayton
and
admit
that
she
still
wanted
to
marry
him.
he
only
used
this
to
show
that
her
testimony
had
been
contradicted.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
petitioner
testified
fully
on
the
fact
that
she
loved
the
other
man
but
no
longer
intended
to
marry
him.
and
this
testimony
followed
that
of
the
undercover
agent
if
her
testimony
had
been
impelled
by
the
fact
that
the
undercover
agent
had
testified
to
this,
she
could
have
coincided
her
testimony
perfectly
with
the
undercover
agent.
there
would
never
been
any
contradiction.
she
had
an
ample
opportunity
to
conform
her
testimony.
but
as
you
will
notice
when
she
was
twice
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
well,
the
point
was
she
could
still
maintain
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
true
but
the
point
is
she
could
have
--
she
could
have
testified
that
she
still
love
arthwell
hayton
but
that
she
had
given
up
any
idea
of
ever
marrying
him
because
he
was
no
good
which
is
one
of
her
statements.
what
was
that
your
honor?
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
my
point
is
that
--
that
the
petitioner's
testimony
followed
that
of
the
undercover
agent
so
that
--
and
the
only
use
that
was
made
of
the
prosecution
was
to
show
this
one
difference
in
her
testimony
without
of
the
undercover
agent.
and
it
was
never
used
to
emphasize
that
she
may
have
still
intended
to
marry
hayton
that
this
statement
that
she
still
love
him
proved
it.
this
is
the
prejudice
that
has
urged
to
find
petitioner.
however,
that
argument
was
never
made
to
the
jury
by
the
district
attorney.
this
would
be
something
that
would
come
out
of
the
minds
of
the
jury.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
perhaps.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
i
have
maintained
that
my
argument
is
strictly
based
upon
the
inadequate
record
in
this
case.
if
this
record
demonstrated
the
elicitation
of
statements,
there
wouldn't
be
--
wouldn't
be
any
question
on
question
one
in
this
case
but
we
have
a
record
that
is
inadequate
and
we
have
this
failure
to
object
thus
the
issue
was
not
brought
into
importance
of
the
trial
and
this
was
an
early
case,
october
of
1964.
the
requirements
of
the
massiah
and
escobedo
at
that
time
were
not
clearly
foreshadowed
and
this
is
the
reason
why
we're
in
the
situation
of
this
inadequate
record.
and
why
i've
maintained
that
we
should
not
reach
the
question
of
harmless
error
on
this
case
is
because
our
record
is
not
going
to
support
an
absolute
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
this
statement
was
never
made
to
the
petitioner
according
to
the
record.
this
was
--
this
was
an
attempt
by
counsel
to
show
that
that
statement
might
have
been
made.
but
the
witness
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no.
she
did
not
admit
making
that
statement.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
i
was
thinking
of
the
statement,
"the
publicity
was
ruining
you."
no,
she
made
the
statement.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes,
she
said
that.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes.
that
was
a
fabrication,
wholly,
but
there's
no
indication
in
our
record
that
this
provoked
any
statement
by
the
accused.
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
undercover
agent
said.
there
is
no
showing
what
the
petitioner
said.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
the
state
of
california
has
a
long
list
of
decisions
in
which
they
made
a
distinction
between
confessions
and
admissions.
and
the
distinction
that
they
have
made
is
that
in
a
confession.
you
invariably
have
potent
evidence,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
it
could
be
well
unreliable
and
untrue
and
this
would
infect
the
entire
fact
finding
process
of
the
trial
so
that
you
have
it
streamed
danger
of
convicting
the
innocent.
but
if
a
statement
is
merely
an
admission
and
it's
cumulative
to
evidence
that
is
properly
admitted
and
in
this
case,
you
realize
we
had
an
extensive
interrogation
under
proper
conditions
by
a
police
officer
wherein
the
petitioner
waived
to
the
right
to
counsel.
she
was
reminded
of
the
fact
that
she
had
been
advised
by
counsel
and
she
said,
"i
would
rather
talk
to
you
than
stay
in
the
jail
cell."
she
was
--
she
admitted
the
fact
that
she
had
loved
the
other
man
and
has
this
affair
and
that
her
husband
was
heavily
insured.
all
of
this
had
been
admitted
to
the
police
before
the
undercover
agent
was
placed
in
the
jail
cell.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
as
soon
as
this
decision
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
our
office
in
conformity
with
the
decisions
as
they
have
come
down
from
this
court
and
from
the
california
appellate
courts,
promulgates
rules
of
police,
recommended
rules
of
police
procedure
through
the
various
district
attorney's
offices
throughout
the
state
whereby
we
recommend
the
police
procedures
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
the
arguello
case,
it
has
been
recommended
that
there
would
be
no
direct
confrontation
in
jail
cells
between
undercover
agents
and
prisoners
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
undoubtedly
going
to
the
conversation
and
that
incriminating
statements
might
be
elicited.
and
once
they
were
elicited,
we
would
--
we
would
have
to
be
bound
by
the
massiah
decisions.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
as
this
--
the
danger
of
eliciting
a
statement
is
present
there
whether
the
actual
presence
of
another
person
would
have
--
would
be
a
process
of
interrogation
having
a
tendency
if
you
elicit
incriminating
statements.
i
would
not
find
that
situation
merely
in
the
presence
of
an
undercover
agent.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no.
at
no
time,
was
there
even
an
objection
raised
your
honor,
much
less
of
a
request
for
a
ruling.
in
chambers,
the
probability
that
this
evidence
would
violate
the
constitutional
rights
was
raised
but
it
was
not
raised
in
the
form
of
an
objection
and
there's
no
rule
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no.
he
was
only
seen.
i
represent
that
this
testimony
would
be
in
violation
of
these
rights
and
on
the
discussions
shifted
to
the
opportunity
to
interview
this
witness.
at
no
time,
was
there
an
objection
--
there
was
a
--
the
trial
court
offered
the
counsel
the
opportunity
to
object
the
following
day.
this
opportunity
was
never
availed
of
in
any
way
leading
to
the
more
reasonable
assumption
that
this
was
a
tactical
decision
on
the
part
of
the
counsel
to
put
this
witness
on
the
stand.
the
counsel
utilized
this
testimony
to
the
fullest
that
mrs.
miller
had
always
denied
her
guilt
and
have
admitted
her
love
affair
with
the
other
man,
and
that
the
prosecution
has
gone
to
undo
links
in
order
to
convict
her.
and
this
testimony
was
used
by
the
defense.
it
was
the
most
forceful
argument
the
defense
had
during
the
whole
case.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
when
i
refer
to
these
various
things
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
when
i
refer
to
this
various
things
that
the
undercover
agent
had
brought
to
the
attention
of
petitioner,
in
my
argument
today,
i
said
that
this
was
improper.
my
only
contention
was,
if
this
record
was
not
developed
to
the
point
to
show
that
this
conduct
resulted
in
the
elicitation
of
statements
on
the
part
of
the
accused.
this
evidence
was
all
brought
out
on
cross-examination
without
ever
having
objected
to
the
statements
that
were
introduced
first.
see,
the
statements
were
brought
out
by
the
district's
attorney
on
direct
examination
and
it
was
established
early
that
this
witness
had
only
been
instructed
to
listen
to
the
accused.
then
on
cross-examination,
after
the
defense
counsel
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
this
witness
the
evening
before,
he
brought
out
the
fact
that
these
things
had
been
done
but
he
failed
to
bring
out
that
any
of
these
acts,
trying
to
get
the
petitioner
to
distrust
her
own
attorney.
i
could
stand
here
before
this
court
can
represent
that
that's
reprehensible
conduct.
we
wouldn't
condone
it.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
sending
up
a
newspaper.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
sending
up
a
newspaper
clipping
with
the
undercover
agent.
we
don't
know
what
the
content
of
the
newspaper
article
was
but
it
was
handed
to
petitioner
to
read.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that
would
be
set
in
to
elicit
a
statement
of
course
for
initial
instructions.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
those
were
her
initial
instructions
when
she
was
placed
in
the
jail
cell
and
that
was
her
testimony.
after
she
was
in
the
jail
cell,
she
would
be
taken
out
periodically
by
the
sheriff
to
make
her
oral
reports,
and
when
they
would
take
--
when
they
take
her
out,
that's
when
this
conduct
started.
now,
there
had
never
been
any
showing
in
the
record
that
all
of
these
--
all
of
the
statements
made
by
the
petitioner
concerning
her
love
for
the
other
man
were
not
made
prior
to
any
of
these
things
having
been
done
and
there
was
--
and
these
matters
were
never
brought
out
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
establish
unconstitutional
conduct
and
prevent
the
introduction
of
the
statements.
have
this
been
done
in
reverse?
have
these
matters
had
been
brought
up
voir
dire?
have
the
proper
objection
been
made?
the
evidence
of
her
statements
in
the
jail
cell,
if
they
were
the
result
of
this
conduct
would
never
been
admitted
in
a
california
court,
but
the
defense
fail
to
raise
the
issue
and
that
is
our
--
that
is
our
contention.
if
this
were
to
happen
then
these
things
that
the
undercover
agent
did
and
they
resulted
in
the
elicitation
of
statements
and
they
were
introduced
in
the
evidence
then
we
would
have
a
clear
record
of
a
constitutional
violation
and
this
--
and
i
don't
stand
before
you
and
argue
anything
to
the
contrary.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
it
was
in
response
to
a
charge
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
condoned
this
conduct
and
i
felt
that
i
had
to
answer
that
in
a
letter
because
the
attorney
general's
office
did
not
in
anyway
should
have
ever
perform
ever
condone
this
conduct
that's
why
i
wrote
the
letter
to
this
court
in
answer
to
that
charge
alone,
that
there
was
any
condemnation
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general's
office
as
to
what
the
undercover
agent
had
done.
that
is
why
the
letter
was
sent.
i
didn't
want
to
make
a
legal
argument.
i
just
wanted
to
state
that
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
that
we're
not
arguing
before
this
court
that
this
type
of
conduct
was
condoned
by
our
office.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
it's
our
position
that
it's
an
imposition
upon
this
court
for
defense
counsel
to
have
deliberately
acquiesce
in
the
introduction
of
this
evidence,
have
used
it
in
both
argument
in
this
part
of
its
defense
and
then
come
to
this
court
and
ask
the
case
to
be
reversed.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
he
was
not.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
the
position
of
the
state
of
california
that
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
there
was
no
violation
of
massiah
and
escobedo.
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
i
have
written
a
letter
in
this
case
condemning
certain
activity
of
the
undercover
agent
in
this
case.
i
wrote
that
letter
because
certain
of
the
conduct,
it
was
not
shown
to
have
evoked
any
of
the
comments
introduced
into
evidence
was
not
approved
by
our
office
and
certainly
wouldn't
be
approved
in
this
day
and
age.
but
our
argument
is
basically
that
we
are
confined
to
precedent
and
the
precedent
is
either
massiah
or
escobedo.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
the
letter
is
not
part
of
the
record.
it
was
in
response
to
the
reply
brief
and
it
was
not
received
by
the
court.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
only
that
certain
sentence
is
in
the
brief
of
petitioner.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
page
13.
now,
the
conduct
that
was
referred
to
in
that
letter
was
the
conduct
that
was
brought
out
by
defense
counsel
on
cross-examination
of
the
undercover
agent.
this
was
not
part
of
the
evidence.
and
the
defense
in
that
cross-examination
never
developed
the
fact
that
the
statements
that
the
prosecution
introduced
into
evidence
were
provoked
by
this
conduct
of
the
undercover
agent.
the
prosecution
initially
put
the
witness
on
the
stand
and
asked
the
circumstances
under
which
she
had
been
placed
in
the
jail
cell.
and
immediately
thereafter,
asked
her
if
she
had
any
conversations
with
the
defendant.
there
was
no
question
regarding
--
questioning
of
the
witness
regarding
a
process
of
interrogation.
the
witness
merely
testified
as
the
certain
statements
made
by
the
petitioner
in
the
fact
that
she
had
been
separated
from
her
husband,
they
had
reconciled.
she
respected
him
but
she
loved
arthwell
hayton
and
still
loved
him
and
was
going
to
europe
with
the
insurance
money.
now,
before
this
evidence
was
introduced,
the
defense
took
the
witness
on
voir
dire
examination
and
established
one
that
she
had
not
been
warned
of
her
constitutional
rights
by
the
undercover
agent
nor
have
the
undercover
agent
told
her
that
she
was
working
for
the
police.
at
that
point,
the
voir
dire
examination
was
terminated.
there
was
no
objection
to
the
evidence
and
whatsoever.
instead,
the
prosecution
was
permitted
to
go
ahead,
introduce
the
statements
and
then
the
prosecution
promptly
closed
and
did
not
have
any
extended
examination
on
this
subject.
the
cross-examination
was
commenced
by
the
defense
counsel
and
he
developed
in
his
first
questions
that
this
undercover
agent
had
been
instructed
when
she
was
placed
in
the
jail
cell
and
it
should
be
emphasized
that
she
was
placed
in
this
jail
cell
prior
to
any
charges
having
been
filed
in
the
court
of
law
against
her.
the
undercover
agent
was
in
the
jail
cell
prior
to
any
complaint
or
indictment.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
she
was
not
sure
what
day
she
left.
that
--
the
record
is
vague
in
that
respect.
the
record
is
vague
as
to
how
long
she
stayed.
it
is
possible
that
she
was
there
following
the
complaint
in
the
admissible
court
which
complaint
was
ought
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
she
was
not
an
experienced
policewoman,
she
was
an
undercover
agent.
there
was
no
evidence
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
she
had
--
she
had
been
used
on
prior
occasions.
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
her
experience
in
the
record.
it
could
be
assumed
that
this
was
her
first
case.
as
far
as
this
record
is
concern.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
it
could
be
except
that
she
had
worked
with
narcotics.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes,
she
had
worked
narcotics
undercover
(voice
overlap)
in
narcotics.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
as
a
narcotics
undercover
agent,
yes.
i
was
referring
to
experience
as
being
an
interrogator
but
there's
just
no
indication
that
she
had
done
this
particular
type
of
undercover
work
before.
the
defense
counsel
developed
immediately
that
she
had
initially
instructed
only
to
listen.
ultimately,
she
was
requested
by
the
sheriff
to
bring
certain
matters
to
the
attention
of
petitioner
and
that
is
the
conduct
that
was
referred
to
in
my
letter
where
she
brought
a
newspaper
clipping
up
and
showed
it
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
just
a
brief
quote
for
that
letter.
it
was
referring
to
this
conduct
make
no
contention
to
this
conduct
can
be
constitutionally
permitted.
but
the
point
we
wish
to
emphasize
and
first,
i
should
point
out
that
mr.
bailey
was
asked
if
there
was
any
contradiction
of
the
record.
the
undercover
agent
did
not
testify
that
she
said
to
the
petitioner
that
publicity
is
ruining
you.
she
was
not
able
to
testify
that
she
had
made
that
statement.
she
was
able
to
testify
only
that
in
her
prior
discussion
with
defense
counsel
and
that
was
the
evening
before
she
took
the
witness
stand
that
she
might
have
said
something
like
that
but
she
did
not
remember
having
said
made
any
statement
with
regard
to
the
newspaper
article.
and
the
rest
of
this
conduct
that
is
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
if
the
statements
had
been
elicited
by
this
type
of
procedure,
this
would
be
a
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
this
would
be
a
violation
of
miranda.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
before
the
indictment
--
today.
this
case
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
this
case
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
well,
at
that
time,
it
would
not
have
been
violation
because
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
at
cali
--
in
california
the
first
dorado
was
decided
in
august
of
that
year
and
had
included
the
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
our
court
which
has
decided
another
case
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
well,
assuming
--
assuming
that
there
had
been
a
charge
in
pleading,
it
might
have
been.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
an
indictment.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes,
the
charge
was
in
the
municipal
court
in
form
of
a
complaint.
she
was
arraigned
on
the
13th.
now,
the
undercover
agent
later
report
on
the
12th
of
october
and
of
course
she
was
making
oral
reports
throughout
her
time
in
this
jail
cell.
and
these
reports
were
ultimately
written
up
by
another
secretary
after
they
have
been
paneled
through
the
undercover
agent's
connection.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
although
--
we
have
no
california
decision.
we
have
people
versus
arguello
which
involved
in
indictment
and
the
questioning
in
that
case
was
in
a
jail
cell
after
the
indictment.
we
have
no
california
case
but
in
view
of
the
circumstances
of
the
defendant
being
represented
by
counsel
having
been
arraigned
in
court,
we
would
--
we
would
not
distinguish
massiah
on
that
ground.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
i
--
no.
not
--
not
--
not
in
this
day
and
age.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
had
the
record
--
have
there
been
a
proper
objection
and
development
at
this
point
of
the
time
to
show
that
this
undercover
agent
had
elicited
these
statements.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
at
the
time
that
the
prosecutor
introduced
this
evidence
your
honor,
he
was
under
the
impression
that
this
witness
had
not
done
any
interrogation
of
the
petitioner.
he
was
under
the
impression
that
this
was
a
listening
post
only.
this
is
the
statement
that
he
made
to
the
judge
when
this,
when
the
old
question
was
raised.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
at
the
time
this
was
decided,
there
was
no
privacy
in
a
jail
cell.
no
privacy
whatsoever.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
we
could
place
an
agent
in
the
jail
cell
section
to
overhear
anything
said
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
and
use
it.
as
long
as
it's
not
elicited
by
an
interrogation
because
we're
interested
in
protecting
the
right
against
self-incrimination
from
interrogation
and
not
against
overhearing
voluntary
and
spontaneous
statements.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
my
whole
point
is
that
on
this
record,
your
honor,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
there
was
any
elicitation
of
these
statements.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
there's
no
showing
that
there
was
a
discussion
when
these
statements
were
brought
out.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
we
can
assume
that
there
was
a
conversation,
your
honor,
but
now
the
point
is
whether
there
is
a
duty
upon
the
part
of
the
defense
to
establish
a
record
showing
this
conversation.
that
is
our
point.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
not
if
she
didn't
interrogate
the
petitioner;
if
she
sat
there
silently
and
listened
as
she
was
have
been
instructed
to
do.
later
on,
her
instructions
changed
and
that's
when
there
might
have
been
a
violation.
but
again,
the
record
is
inadequate
to
show
that
the
things
done
by
this
undercover
agent
elicited
any
of
these
statements.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
she
made
periodic
reports.
i'm
not
certain
the
record
establishes
daily
reports.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
there's
no
showing
that
this
was
in
her
report.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
there
was
no
showing
that
this
was
in
her
report.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
i've
never
seen
her
report
and
there's
no
--
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
her
written
reports
but
what
is
in
the
record
is
the
fact
that
these
reports
were
available
to
defense
counsel
before
the
witness
was
called
to
the
stand
and--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
the
prosecutor
has
had
the
report
obviously
but
that
point
is
we
don't
know
what
was
in
that
report.
we
do
know
that
defense
counsel
interviewed
the
witness
the
evening
before
she
was
placed
on
the
witness
stand.
and
this
was
between
the
time
that
there
had
been
a
discussion
in
the
trial
court
chambers
as
to
this
evidence.
this
is
a
point
that
was
brought
out,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
objection
when
the
chamber
discussion
started,
the
witness
had
been
placed
on
the
stand
and
the
defense
counsel
asked
to
go
into
chambers
and
discussed
this
witness'
testimony.
proceedings
adjourned
to
chambers
where
he
had
an
opportunity
to
make
an
objection
if
he
wanted
to
make
one.
at
that
time,
he
did
not
make
an
objection.
his
statement
was,
"i
am
going
to
represent
to
the
court
also,
that
any
testimony
of
this
witness
concerning
any
statement
made
by
my
client
would
be
in
violation
of
the
rule
in
the
dorado
case."
and
then
proceeded
a
discussion
of
the
fact
that
it
would
be
in
violation
and
that
he
hadn't
had
an
opportunity
to
interview
this
witness
as
on
pages
42
through
47
of
the
appendix.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes,
he
was
entitled
to
--
he
was
promised
an
opportunity
by
the
district
attorney
to
interview
this
witness.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
there
would
have
been
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
to
permit
that
the
prosecution
witness
to
be
interviewed.
he
would
be
entitled
only
to
the
witness'
statements
after
she
had
taken
the
stand
and
use
them
or
if
there
is
a
showing
of
a
need
for
discovery.
now,
at
the
time
that
this
discussion
was
taken
place,
the
principal
concern
with
the
defense
counsel
was
an
opportunity
to
interview
this
witness
and
the
trial
court
said
that
the
witness
should
be
withdrawn
and
have
an
opportunity
to
interview
her
and
then
the
trial
court
stated
that
she
should
be
placed
on
the
stand
and
certain
foundational
matters
be
arrived
at
and
that
proper
objection
made
to
her
testimony.
properly,
the
proceedings
end.
there
was
no
ruling
on
any
objection,
there
was
no
objection
made
in
chambers.
there's
ample
opportunity
to
ask
the
court
for
permission
to
question
this
witness
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
determine
if
there
was
any
foundation
for
an
objection
in
the
basis
of
massiah,
escobedo
or
dorado
in
california.
this
opportunity
was
not
requested
and
it
is
the
law
of
california
that
that
opportunity
is
available
to
any
counsel.
now,
the
excuse
has
been
brought
forth
that
the
reason
for
a
failure
to
object
the
following
day
was
a
fear
that
the
jury
would
feel
the
evidence
was
being
concealed.
the
following
day
of
counsel
had
made
a
request
for
this
witness
to
be
examined
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
court
would
have
been
obliged
to
grant
it.
there
is
no
request
whatsoever
for
an
opportunity
to
do
this
and
there
was
no
objection
on
the
part
of
the
defense
even
after
the
prosecution
commence
to
examine
the
witness.
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
obvious
after
this
witness
had
testified
that
the
reason
the
counsel
determined
not
to
object
was
a
tactical
one.
he
had
learned
the
evening
before
the
context
with
this
witness'
testimony.
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
was
going
to
be
an
absolute
of
court
with
the
testimony
of
previous
witnesses
and
the
previous
statements
to
the
police
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
this
statement
as
i
indicated
was
made
by
the
court
that
he
did
indicate
an
objection
that
would
have
to
be
made
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
i'm
talking
about
an
examination
of
this
witness
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
lay
the
foundation
that
there
was
a
violation,
and
once
that
foundation
was
laid,
it
is
problematic
on
whether
the
judge
would
have
required
the
witness
to
resume
the
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
merely
for
the
formality
of
an
objection.
that
would
be
a
complete
waste
of
time
if
the
foundation
were
laid
that
this
was
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
the
judge
would
have
immediately
ruled
that
we
are
not
going
to
consider
this
evidence.
it's
not
going
to
be
offered
and
an
objection
would
be
sustained.
this
opportunity
that
was
always
present
was
never
availed
of
by
the
defense
and
that
is
why
i
maintained
that
this
was
a
tactical
decision
to
permit
this
evidence.
based
upon
the
fact
that
this
witness
would
corroborate
petitioner
in
every
statement
that
she'd
made
to
the
police
that
this
was
an
accidental
fire
and
that
although
she
loved
another
man,
she
had
given
up
any
intention
whatsoever
of
marrying
him
and
that
was
the
only
issue
at
the
time
of
the
trial
on
motive
whether
she
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
i
don't
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no.
she
did
not
say
that
to
her.
fisk's
testimony
was
very
brief
on
that
subject.
it's
just
a
question
of
loving
mr.
hayton
and
still
loving
him.
the
question
of
marriage
was
never
even
discussed
by
agent
fisk.
and
this
--
the
district
attorney
an
argument,
the
argument
is
set
forth
in
our
appendix,
never
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
still
love
arthwell
hayton
and
admit
that
she
still
wanted
to
marry
him.
he
only
used
this
to
show
that
her
testimony
had
been
contradicted.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
petitioner
testified
fully
on
the
fact
that
she
loved
the
other
man
but
no
longer
intended
to
marry
him.
and
this
testimony
followed
that
of
the
undercover
agent
if
her
testimony
had
been
impelled
by
the
fact
that
the
undercover
agent
had
testified
to
this,
she
could
have
coincided
her
testimony
perfectly
with
the
undercover
agent.
there
would
never
been
any
contradiction.
she
had
an
ample
opportunity
to
conform
her
testimony.
but
as
you
will
notice
when
she
was
twice
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
well,
the
point
was
she
could
still
maintain
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
true
but
the
point
is
she
could
have
--
she
could
have
testified
that
she
still
love
arthwell
hayton
but
that
she
had
given
up
any
idea
of
ever
marrying
him
because
he
was
no
good
which
is
one
of
her
statements.
what
was
that
your
honor?
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
my
point
is
that
--
that
the
petitioner's
testimony
followed
that
of
the
undercover
agent
so
that
--
and
the
only
use
that
was
made
of
the
prosecution
was
to
show
this
one
difference
in
her
testimony
without
of
the
undercover
agent.
and
it
was
never
used
to
emphasize
that
she
may
have
still
intended
to
marry
hayton
that
this
statement
that
she
still
love
him
proved
it.
this
is
the
prejudice
that
has
urged
to
find
petitioner.
however,
that
argument
was
never
made
to
the
jury
by
the
district
attorney.
this
would
be
something
that
would
come
out
of
the
minds
of
the
jury.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
perhaps.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
i
have
maintained
that
my
argument
is
strictly
based
upon
the
inadequate
record
in
this
case.
if
this
record
demonstrated
the
elicitation
of
statements,
there
wouldn't
be
--
wouldn't
be
any
question
on
question
one
in
this
case
but
we
have
a
record
that
is
inadequate
and
we
have
this
failure
to
object
thus
the
issue
was
not
brought
into
importance
of
the
trial
and
this
was
an
early
case,
october
of
1964.
the
requirements
of
the
massiah
and
escobedo
at
that
time
were
not
clearly
foreshadowed
and
this
is
the
reason
why
we're
in
the
situation
of
this
inadequate
record.
and
why
i've
maintained
that
we
should
not
reach
the
question
of
harmless
error
on
this
case
is
because
our
record
is
not
going
to
support
an
absolute
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
this
statement
was
never
made
to
the
petitioner
according
to
the
record.
this
was
--
this
was
an
attempt
by
counsel
to
show
that
that
statement
might
have
been
made.
but
the
witness
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no.
she
did
not
admit
making
that
statement.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
i
was
thinking
of
the
statement,
"the
publicity
was
ruining
you."
no,
she
made
the
statement.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes,
she
said
that.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
yes.
that
was
a
fabrication,
wholly,
but
there's
no
indication
in
our
record
that
this
provoked
any
statement
by
the
accused.
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
undercover
agent
said.
there
is
no
showing
what
the
petitioner
said.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
the
state
of
california
has
a
long
list
of
decisions
in
which
they
made
a
distinction
between
confessions
and
admissions.
and
the
distinction
that
they
have
made
is
that
in
a
confession.
you
invariably
have
potent
evidence,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
it
could
be
well
unreliable
and
untrue
and
this
would
infect
the
entire
fact
finding
process
of
the
trial
so
that
you
have
it
streamed
danger
of
convicting
the
innocent.
but
if
a
statement
is
merely
an
admission
and
it's
cumulative
to
evidence
that
is
properly
admitted
and
in
this
case,
you
realize
we
had
an
extensive
interrogation
under
proper
conditions
by
a
police
officer
wherein
the
petitioner
waived
to
the
right
to
counsel.
she
was
reminded
of
the
fact
that
she
had
been
advised
by
counsel
and
she
said,
"i
would
rather
talk
to
you
than
stay
in
the
jail
cell."
she
was
--
she
admitted
the
fact
that
she
had
loved
the
other
man
and
has
this
affair
and
that
her
husband
was
heavily
insured.
all
of
this
had
been
admitted
to
the
police
before
the
undercover
agent
was
placed
in
the
jail
cell.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
as
soon
as
this
decision
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
our
office
in
conformity
with
the
decisions
as
they
have
come
down
from
this
court
and
from
the
california
appellate
courts,
promulgates
rules
of
police,
recommended
rules
of
police
procedure
through
the
various
district
attorney's
offices
throughout
the
state
whereby
we
recommend
the
police
procedures
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
the
arguello
case,
it
has
been
recommended
that
there
would
be
no
direct
confrontation
in
jail
cells
between
undercover
agents
and
prisoners
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
undoubtedly
going
to
the
conversation
and
that
incriminating
statements
might
be
elicited.
and
once
they
were
elicited,
we
would
--
we
would
have
to
be
bound
by
the
massiah
decisions.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
as
this
--
the
danger
of
eliciting
a
statement
is
present
there
whether
the
actual
presence
of
another
person
would
have
--
would
be
a
process
of
interrogation
having
a
tendency
if
you
elicit
incriminating
statements.
i
would
not
find
that
situation
merely
in
the
presence
of
an
undercover
agent.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no.
at
no
time,
was
there
even
an
objection
raised
your
honor,
much
less
of
a
request
for
a
ruling.
in
chambers,
the
probability
that
this
evidence
would
violate
the
constitutional
rights
was
raised
but
it
was
not
raised
in
the
form
of
an
objection
and
there's
no
rule
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no.
he
was
only
seen.
i
represent
that
this
testimony
would
be
in
violation
of
these
rights
and
on
the
discussions
shifted
to
the
opportunity
to
interview
this
witness.
at
no
time,
was
there
an
objection
--
there
was
a
--
the
trial
court
offered
the
counsel
the
opportunity
to
object
the
following
day.
this
opportunity
was
never
availed
of
in
any
way
leading
to
the
more
reasonable
assumption
that
this
was
a
tactical
decision
on
the
part
of
the
counsel
to
put
this
witness
on
the
stand.
the
counsel
utilized
this
testimony
to
the
fullest
that
mrs.
miller
had
always
denied
her
guilt
and
have
admitted
her
love
affair
with
the
other
man,
and
that
the
prosecution
has
gone
to
undo
links
in
order
to
convict
her.
and
this
testimony
was
used
by
the
defense.
it
was
the
most
forceful
argument
the
defense
had
during
the
whole
case.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
when
i
refer
to
these
various
things
--
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
when
i
refer
to
this
various
things
that
the
undercover
agent
had
brought
to
the
attention
of
petitioner,
in
my
argument
today,
i
said
that
this
was
improper.
my
only
contention
was,
if
this
record
was
not
developed
to
the
point
to
show
that
this
conduct
resulted
in
the
elicitation
of
statements
on
the
part
of
the
accused.
this
evidence
was
all
brought
out
on
cross-examination
without
ever
having
objected
to
the
statements
that
were
introduced
first.
see,
the
statements
were
brought
out
by
the
district's
attorney
on
direct
examination
and
it
was
established
early
that
this
witness
had
only
been
instructed
to
listen
to
the
accused.
then
on
cross-examination,
after
the
defense
counsel
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
this
witness
the
evening
before,
he
brought
out
the
fact
that
these
things
had
been
done
but
he
failed
to
bring
out
that
any
of
these
acts,
trying
to
get
the
petitioner
to
distrust
her
own
attorney.
i
could
stand
here
before
this
court
can
represent
that
that's
reprehensible
conduct.
we
wouldn't
condone
it.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
sending
up
a
newspaper.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
sending
up
a
newspaper
clipping
with
the
undercover
agent.
we
don't
know
what
the
content
of
the
newspaper
article
was
but
it
was
handed
to
petitioner
to
read.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that
would
be
set
in
to
elicit
a
statement
of
course
for
initial
instructions.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
those
were
her
initial
instructions
when
she
was
placed
in
the
jail
cell
and
that
was
her
testimony.
after
she
was
in
the
jail
cell,
she
would
be
taken
out
periodically
by
the
sheriff
to
make
her
oral
reports,
and
when
they
would
take
--
when
they
take
her
out,
that's
when
this
conduct
started.
now,
there
had
never
been
any
showing
in
the
record
that
all
of
these
--
all
of
the
statements
made
by
the
petitioner
concerning
her
love
for
the
other
man
were
not
made
prior
to
any
of
these
things
having
been
done
and
there
was
--
and
these
matters
were
never
brought
out
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
establish
unconstitutional
conduct
and
prevent
the
introduction
of
the
statements.
have
this
been
done
in
reverse?
have
these
matters
had
been
brought
up
voir
dire?
have
the
proper
objection
been
made?
the
evidence
of
her
statements
in
the
jail
cell,
if
they
were
the
result
of
this
conduct
would
never
been
admitted
in
a
california
court,
but
the
defense
fail
to
raise
the
issue
and
that
is
our
--
that
is
our
contention.
if
this
were
to
happen
then
these
things
that
the
undercover
agent
did
and
they
resulted
in
the
elicitation
of
statements
and
they
were
introduced
in
the
evidence
then
we
would
have
a
clear
record
of
a
constitutional
violation
and
this
--
and
i
don't
stand
before
you
and
argue
anything
to
the
contrary.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
it
was
in
response
to
a
charge
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
condoned
this
conduct
and
i
felt
that
i
had
to
answer
that
in
a
letter
because
the
attorney
general's
office
did
not
in
anyway
should
have
ever
perform
ever
condone
this
conduct
that's
why
i
wrote
the
letter
to
this
court
in
answer
to
that
charge
alone,
that
there
was
any
condemnation
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general's
office
as
to
what
the
undercover
agent
had
done.
that
is
why
the
letter
was
sent.
i
didn't
want
to
make
a
legal
argument.
i
just
wanted
to
state
that
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
that
we're
not
arguing
before
this
court
that
this
type
of
conduct
was
condoned
by
our
office.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
it's
our
position
that
it's
an
imposition
upon
this
court
for
defense
counsel
to
have
deliberately
acquiesce
in
the
introduction
of
this
evidence,
have
used
it
in
both
argument
in
this
part
of
its
defense
and
then
come
to
this
court
and
ask
the
case
to
be
reversed.
mr.
philip
c.
griffin
no,
he
was
not.
