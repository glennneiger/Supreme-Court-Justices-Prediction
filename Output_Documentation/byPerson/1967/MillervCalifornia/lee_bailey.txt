mr.
lee
bailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
conviction
for
murder
in
the
first
degree.
in
the
course
of
procuring
that
conviction,
the
state
of
california,
subsequent
to
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner
and
subsequent
to
the
time
when
she
was
represented
by
counsel
overtly.
planted
in
her
cell
was
an
agent
of
the
prosecution,
a
policewoman,
posing
as
a
narcotics
addict
who
had
supposedly
been
confined
by
the
state,
in
order
to
overhear,
listen
and
stimulate
conversation
from
the
petitioner
which
it
hoped
it
would
be
able
to
use
to
incriminate
her
at
the
trial.
as
a
result
of
this
stimulation,
certain
statements
were
made
which
are
characterized
as
admissions.
the
petitioner
denied
her
guilt
but
admitted
the
motive
to
the
crime
at
least
as
to
its
existence.
this
is
not
a
usual
uxoricide.
the
precedent
in
this
case
was
a
dentist.
the
defendant
or
petitioner
his
wife
and
an
affair
had
been
going
on
involving
an
attorney
named
hayton.
the
death
occurred
as
a
result
of
a
fire
in
a
volkswagen
sedan
on
the
early
morning
hours
of
october
8,
1964.
as
of
the
moment
of
that
death,
there
was
on
the
record
a
series
of
decisions
dealing
with
this
very
problem
including
specifically
massiah
against
the
united
states,
escobedo
against
illinois
and
mcleod
against
ohio
applying
massiah
to
the
states.
within
24
hours
or
so,
this
petitioner
had
been
arrested.
the
police
filling
that
circumstantial
evidence,
pointed
to
the
fact
that
she
had
set
the
fire.
a
large
part
of
this
was
evidence
of
her
affair
with
the
attorney
named
hayton.
at
the
time
of
her
arrest,
she
was
met
at
the
jail
by
an
attorney
of
her
own
selection.
she
was
booked
for
murder.
the
police
attempted
to
interrogate
her.
counsel
objected
to
interrogation
following
arrest
and
following
representation
by
counsel.
in
order
to
protect
her
from
interrogation,
they
set
up
a
24-hour
watch
at
the
jail.
this
all
began
on
october
9th,
the
day
following
the
murder
--
mr.
lee
bailey
several
counsel
for
petitioner
--
counsel
being
unable
to
remain
awake
24
hours
must
have
some
of
his
colleagues
to
assist
him
in
the
watch
and
protect
the
petitioner.
at
11
p.m.
on
october
9th,
the
sheriff
whom
i
will
presume
had
some
knowledge
of
the
decisions
to
which
i
have
alluded
deliberately
inserted
passed
on
unsuspecting
counsel,
his
policewoman
undercover
agent
into
the
cell
of
petitioner.
her
instructions
were
to
listen
to
what
petitioner
said
and
the
state
in
its
argument
will
represent
that
she
in
no
way
interrogated
petitioner
but
was
merely
a
listening
post.
she
did
not
carry
a
recording
device
or
transmitter
of
any
kind.
mr.
lee
bailey
both
your
honor.
before
and
after
the
state
court
injunction
because
nobody
knew
at
the
time
the
injunction
was
issued
that
the
spy
was
in
the
cell
and
the
state
did
not
disclose
it
to
the
judge
who
gave
the
injunction.
among
the
things
which
the
undercover
agent
did
in
order
to
stimulate
remarks
by
the
petitioner
that
might
be
of
evidentiary
value
are
the
following:
first,
she
said
and
this
was
a
deliberate
lie
as
she
admitted.
she
had
overheard
man
from
the
district
attorney's
office
say
arthwell
hayton
came
in
today
and
blew
the
top
off
this
case.
she
then
presented
petitioner
with
a
newspaper
clipping
furnished
her
by
the
sheriff
or
his
agents
and
said,
the
publicity
is
ruining
you
in
this
case.
she
related
that
from
her
experience
as
a
criminal,
she
had
caused
a
distrust
lawyers.
suggested
that
petitioner
distrust
her
own
lawyer
and
further
suggested
that
the
sheriff
was
a
nice
man
and
should
be
trusted
by
petitioner
and
that
she
ought
to
talk
to
him.
mr.
lee
bailey
it
is
uncontradicted,
your
honor.
the
state
has
seen
fit
to
furnish
an
extensive
appendix
of
testimony
and
the
testimony
of
peggy
fisk
at
the
trial
is
included
verbatim.
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
that
these
things
were
done
and
that
they
were
done
at
the
specific
or
general
insistence
of
her
superiors,
the
sheriff
and
his
agents.
now,
mrs.
miller
did
say,
i
did
not
set
the
fire.
it
was
accidental.
and
she
has
stoutly
maintained
that
that
was
so.
but
she
also
said
that
she
was
still
in
love
with
arthwell
hayton
and
this
immediately
after
her
husband's
death
and
that
she
felt
that
arthwell
hayton
would
come
to
her
at
an
appropriate
time,
that
she
hope
to
take
the
insurance
money,
$100,000.00
which
was
carried
on
her
husband
and
take
the
children
to
europe
although
it
was
explained
that
this
was
to
avoid
being
crucified
by
the
society
that
had
put
her
to
trial.
at
the
time
of
trial,
the
government
proposed
to
use
this
tainted
evidence.
i
point
this
out
because
the
harmless
error
rule
which
is
at
issue
here
today
has
been
carved
out
in
my
judgment
and
from
a
reading
of
the
chapman
and
fahy
cases
and
the
notions
expressed
therein
in
order
to
avoid
summary
reversal
where
a
comparatively
minor
piece
of
evidence
is
led
in
through
a
blunder
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
or
the
part
of
the
judge
and
an
expensive
retrial
needs
to
be
avoided
because
no
substantial
prejudice
results.
but
i
do
point
out
that
these
were
two
deliberate
violations
at
two
separate
stages.
the
sheriff
by
circumventing
her
right
to
counsel
and
knowingly
injecting
a
spy
into
a
cell
where
she
was
confined
against
her
will.
and
second,
by
the
prosecutor
in
offering
testimony
which
he
well
knew
at
that
time
presuming
he
could
read
and
understand
the
principle
behind
the
massiah,
escobedo
and
mcleod,
well
knew
to
be
illicitly
gained
on
the
cheat
and
deceptively
nonetheless
wish
to
use
because
he
felt
that
would
show
her
guilt.
anomalously,
the
prosecutor
comes
before
this
court
and
says
that
the
evidence
was
unnecessary
and
not
prejudicial.
i
do
point
out
that
no
other
evidence
demonstrated
mrs.
miller's
alleged
continuing
love
for
the
paramour
hayton
after
her
husband's
death.
something
calculated
to
enrage
the
jury
and
presumably
since
it
took
three
days
for
this
jury
to
decide
the
case,
somebody
was
enraged
because
the
verdict
was
conviction.
at
the
time
that
the
evidence
was
offered,
the
defense
counsel
exhibited
some
surprise
and
said,
well,
i
have
never
interviewed
this
witness
as
it
is
my
right
and
i
object
that
this
was
done
in
the
lobby
but
it
was
done
on
the
record.
and
he
was
permitted
to
interview
the
witness.
but
prior
to
doing
so,
he
pointed
out
to
the
court,
this
evidence
is
inadmissible
and
he
cited
the
very
decisions
that
i
have
mentioned
here
and
also
people
against
dorado,
the
california
decision
on
the
escobedo
principle.
interviewed
the
witness
in
the
following
morning,
the
prosecutor
put
her
on
the
stand
but
before
that
happened,
the
defense
counsel
said
to
the
judge,
it
is
unfair
to
make
me
object
before
the
jury.
obviously,
they
might
draw
some
inference
that
i
am
keeping
out
a
confession
or
an
admission
that
the
crime
was
committed.
and
he
said
specifically
and
this
is
in
the
record,
judge
you
know
that
it
isn't
right
to
make
me
do
that.
and
the
judge
said,
we
must
put
her
on.
have
a
preliminary
foundation
laid
and
an
objection
at
the
proper
time,
it
cannot
be
done
in
the
absence
of
the
jury.
mr.
lee
bailey
i
understand
your
honor.
i'm
informed
by
my
colleague
that
page
42
is
the
correct
page.
mr.
lee
bailey
now,
because
the
counsel
always
carries
the
dual
burden
of
protecting
a
record
and
persuading
the
jury
of
his
client's
innocence
if
he
can,
this
counsel,
mr.
foley,
felt
that
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
that
he
must
object
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
was
incorrect
and
that
he
had
preserved
his
rights
for
appeal
as
i
suggest
he
did
and
therefore,
he
did
not
take
that
objection
in
order
not
i
think,
to
cause
the
jury
to
suspect
that
something
meaty
was
being
kept
from
him.
from
these
circumstances,
two
questions
had
been
accepted
by
this
court
for
a
review.
was
the
procedure
by
means
of
which
these
admissions
were
obtained
by
the
state
of
california
an
unconstitutional
violation
of
petitioner's
rights?
first
not
to
incriminate
herself
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
second
her
right
to
have
counsel
present
any
time
an
agent
of
the
government
interrogates
after
she
has
been
arrested
and
has
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment.
it
was
admitted
by
peggy
fisk,
the
undercover
agent
that
she
had
no
time
to
disclose
her
identity,
the
nature
of
her
office
and
did
not
advise
petitioner
that
she
had
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer
present
during
these
conversations.
if
it
is
a
violation,
the
question
is
then
taken
for
consideration
of
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
can
ever
be
a
harmless
error.
within
the
meaning
of
harmless
error
as
it
has
been
described
in
the
decision
in
fahy
against
connecticut
and
chapman
against
california.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
bailey
i
think,
your
honor,
we
can
always
insist
that
counsel
make
his
objection
for
the
record
at
the
sidebar
or
the
bench.
as
this
counsel
sought
to
do,
he
did
not
wish
to
forfeit
his
chance
to
win
a
jury
case
because
he
thought
the
judge
was
making
an
error.
he
would
rather
have
won
it
than
taking
this
appeal.
mr.
lee
bailey
very
clearly,
your
honor.
he
asked
not
to
be
made
to
object
in
front
of
the
jury.
he
did
object
for
the
record
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
lee
bailey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
rule
--
as
far
as
the
ruling
could
go
was
that
the
judge
would
have
to
rule
that
he
must
object
in
open
court.
he
did
not
rule
in
the
lobby
because
he
said
it's
not
before
me.
we
think
that
the
judge
was
mistaken.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
your
honor,
i
am.
i
think
the
principle
of
jackson
against
denno
is
applicable
and
i
think
that
because
jurors
do
not
necessarily
understand
the
machinations
of
the
rules
of
evidence.
if
counsel
wishes
to
state
his
position
which
is
probably
the
better
procedure
at
the
sidebar
instead
of
giving
a
speech
in
front
of
the
jury
and
to
make
his
objections
there
that
he
may
properly
do
so
and
the
judge
refuses
to
let
him
is
forcing
him
to
prejudice
his
case
in
front
of
the
jury
simply
because
they
don't
understand
rulings
of
law
and
we
should
presume
that
they
don't
at
least
not
in
our
cases.
now,
the
third
issue
was
offered
to
this
court
and
that
is
whether
or
not
assuming
that
it
were
found
that
harmless
error
could
occur
with
respect
to
admissions
whether
or
not
the
error
in
this
case
was
harmless.
that
issue
was
rejected
and
is
not
before
the
court
and
so
the
further
facts
of
the
case
which
are
recited
by
the
state
of
california
to
the
tune
of
about
250
pages,
trying
to
show
that
the
error
was
not
harmless,
will
not
be
alluded
to
by
the
petitioner
who
believes
that
issue
to
have
been
deemed
irrelevant.
the
question
then
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
i
take
it
to
the
state
of
california
although
it
vacillates
very
sharply
between
its
briefs
and
its
letters
to
this
court.
in
the
final
analysis
at
least
does
not
approve
this
deceptive
procedure
and
at
one
point
said
flatly
in
a
letter
the
court
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
briefs
and
which
is
part
of
the
record,
we
did
not
mean
to
say
that
this
was
not
an
unconstitutional
procedure,
we
condemn
it.
assuming
that
it
is
a
constitutional
violation
and
i
see
no
reason
to
quarrel
with
that
if
this
were
to
occur
today
very
obviously,
it
would
be
under
the
miranda
rule
that
we
are
not
favored
with
that
because
of
the
time
of
our
trial,
the
trial
was
in
january
of
1965.
nonetheless,
under
escobedo
and
under
massiah
which
involved
very
similar
circumstances
and
where
there
was
counsel
to
represent
the
defendant,
these
procedures
have
been
condemned
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
constitutional
violation
will
invite
this
kind
of
deception
every
time
law
enforcement
is
frustrated
by
the
rules
that
this
court
has
created
to
protect
individuals
who
are
subject
to
interrogation.
to
go
in
through
the
back
door
demolishes
any
value
in
creating
a
strong
front
door
and
that
is
exactly
what
would
happen.
i
see
perilously
little
difference
between
my
planting
a
spy
in
the
district
attorney's
office
to
pose
as
his
secretary
and
steal
his
files
and
the
sheriff
planting
a
spy
in
a
cell
where
my
client
is
improperly
held
if
she
is
innocent
or
being
properly
held
is
not
suppose
to
pay
a
penalty
because
she
can't
make
bail
and
taking
advantage
of
that
situation
in
a
cheatful
manner
obtaining
evidence
he
could
not
otherwise
get.
if
it
is
a
constitutional
violation
could
it
ever
be
harmless,
well,
the
court
has
held
i
think
pretty
uniformly
that
confessions
will
not
be
assumed
to
be
harmless
and
can
admissions
be
harmless.
this
type
of
admission
certainly
can
never
be
harmless
because
it
is
an
admission
to
the
motive
in
the
case.
the
murder
case
of
this
sort
is
on
shaky
ground
without
some
motive.
obviously,
if
the
state
had
been
faced
with
a
situation
where
two
happy
church
going
people
with
a
stable
family,
a
nice
community
position,
wound
up
in
a
burning
volkswagen
and
the
wife
escaped,
they
would
have
a
pretty
poor
case
for
murder.
mr.
lee
bailey
she
admitted
on
the
stand,
your
honor.
but
the
question
before
the
jury
was
did
she
on
the
night
in
question
have
sufficient
malice
in
her
heart
and
sufficient
motive
to
burn
her
husband
up,
her
contention
was
that
this
affair
had
terminated
and
was
not
a
motive.
the
only
piece
of
evidence
that
clearly
contradicted
her
testimony
was
the
testimony
of
peggy
fisk
saying,
i
still
love
arthwell
hayton.
if
the
jury
believed
that,
the
motive
was
a
continuing
thing.
if
they
did
not,
they
might
have
had
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
this
affair
had
terminated
and
having
had
that
dealt
the
result
would
have
been
quite
different.
if
the
court
were
to
say
that
there
can
be
harmless
error
in
admissions,
i
think
a
number
of
serious
problems
would
crop
up.
it
would
require
a
case
by
case
adjudication
and
an
onerous
burden.
it
would
tempt
law
enforcement
to
use
tactics
of
this
sort
in
the
fun
hope
that
perhaps
on
appeal,
this
would
be
deemed
to
one
of
the
exceptional
cases.
and
i
think
that
either
of
those
procedures
would
hurt
not
only
the
cause
of
justice
but
the
consistency
of
our
constitutional
principle.
now,
very
frankly,
the
best
rule
would
be
in
my
judgment
to
absolutely
deter
conduct
of
this
kind
because
i'm
very
fearful
of
the
analogous
case
where
the
evidence
is
not
used
and
the
counsel
never
learns
that
a
spy
has
been
used
in
the
cell.
would
the
fruits
of
those
conversations
if
they
led
to
other
evidence,
unconstitutionally
obtained,
be
improper
and
how
would
the
defendant
ever
know
it?
this
prosecutor
elected
to
use
the
evidence.
if
he
had
not,
the
petitioner
might
never
have
known
about
peggy
fisk
and
conceivably
could
have
suffered
damage
as
a
result
of
the
violation
never
recorded
and
never
brought
to
her
attention.
i
believe
that
it
should
be
stamped
out
of
that
level
but
if
not,
if
this
conduct
is
permissible,
if
law
enforcement
officers
may
make
the
attempt
to
put
spies
in
cells
because
some
people
can't
make
bail
because
the
charges
capital
or
because
they
don't
have
money
then
they
will
certainly
do
so
if
the
court
gives
one
wink
of
approval
on
it.
and
then
we
must
always
decide
whether
or
not
if
they
don't
use
the
evidence,
they
are
within
the
limits
of
constitutional
doctrine.
if
they
do
use
the
evidence,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
blunder,
the
kind
of
mistake
made
in
the
heat
of
trial
that
the
harmless
error
doctrine
was
made
to
accommodate.
it
is
certainly
true
that
after
a
three-month
trial
with
a
very
minor
slipped
of
the
tongue
which
is
corrected
by
the
court,
a
prosecutor
statement
might
be
deemed
harmless
error
even
though
it
fell
within
the
preview
of
a
constitutional
violation.
but
where
the
deception
and
the
violation
in
the
first
instance
was
deliberate
and
conceived
as
an
effort
to
get
around
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right,
and
then
where
the
use
of
the
evidence
by
a
knowing
lawyer
who
presumably
understood
the
law
and
was
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
reversal
to
have
his
jury
conviction
injected
that
evidence
over
objection
before
the
jury
then
we
have
a
two
stage
deliberate
violation
that
this
court
need
never
protect
with
a
harmless
error
exception.
mr.
lee
bailey
once
the
right
to
counsel
had
accrued,
once
a
formal
charge
had
been
lodged
then
i
would
say
any
informer
would
have
to
acquaint
the
defendant
with
his
identity
in
order
to
obtain
a
waiver
so
that
the
statements
could
be
used.
i
think
massiah
stands
for
that,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
your
honor
because
i
think
escobedo
does
that.
the
protection
of
counsel
has
to
arise
at
some
point.
i
think
in
the
view
of
this
court
disregarding
miranda
and
sticking
with
1964
as
these
law
enforcement
officers
confronted
the
situation
and
at
least
arose
--
mr.
lee
bailey
i
think
that
miranda
would
help
me
simply
because
it
does
nothing
to
dilute
escobedo
and
miranda
and
it
require
i
mean
--
and
massiah
and
it
require
warnings.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
if
this
technique
is
to
be
used,
the
technique
of
deception,
i
understood
the
massiah
case
is
condemning
that
technique
once
a
charge
had
been
made
and
the
counsel
had
been
brought
into
the
case
as
a
violation
through
the
secret
use,
an
imposition
on
an
unknowing
defendant,
a
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel
or
the
right
not
to
incriminate
oneself.
and
the
minute
exceptions
are
carved
out,
imaginative
law
enforcement
officers
are
going
to
find
new
ways
to
cloak
spies,
hoping
to
get
through
what
little
keyhole
maybe
left
in
the
room.
the
--
mr.
lee
bailey
hayton.
your
honor.
mr.
lee
bailey
she
said,
i
believe
your
honor
the
minute
that
cork
was
gone
--
mr.
lee
bailey
she
had
no
more
feeling.
yes.
mr.
lee
bailey
no,
i
think
not
your
honors.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
replied
brief,
if
she
had
killed
her
husband
for
the
purpose
of
marrying
hayton
as
it
appears
from
the
testimony
of
peggy
fisk,
then
in
this
event,
certainly
the
love
would
be
thought
to
continue
because
she
had
accomplished
the
purpose
and
come
closer
to
her
purpose.
but
she
says
that
spontaneously
because
of
the
impact
of
what
happened
to
her
husband
in
what
she
terms
an
accidental
situation,
whatever
feeling
she
had
for
this
attorney
dissipated
immediately.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes.
and
she
was
made
a
liar
if
the
jury
believed
peggy
fisk
and
i
assume
that
they
did
by
her
statement
a
few
days
later,
i
still
love
him
and
he
will
come
to
me,
which
was
the
most
damaging
of
all.
mr.
lee
bailey
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
bailey
if
she
had
killed
her
husband,
she
certainly
would
have
killed
him
before
the
moment
of
his
death.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
but
it
fully
appears
from
listening
to
the
testimony
of
peggy
fisk
that
this
petitioner
has
killed
her
husband
that
she's
accomplished
that
purpose.
she
hopes
to
be
acquitted
and
that
hayton
will
then
come
to
her.
she
says,
when
this
mess
is
cleaned
up,
he
will
come
to
me.
so
her
plan
is
a
continuing
one.
mr.
lee
bailey
oh
yes.
mr.
lee
bailey
she
always
denied
that
she
killed
her
husband.
mr.
lee
bailey
and
always
claim
that
it
was
an
accident.
and
the
case
was
--
mr.
lee
bailey
yes
she
did.
yes,
she
did.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
there's
no
question
about
this.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
four
minutes
as
i
see
them
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
lee
bailey
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
not
meet
the
legal
arguments
advanced
by
my
brothers
since
i
think
they
have
been
covered.
but
he
has
demonstrated
confusion
as
to
the
facts
that
i
think
worth
straightening
out.
first,
it
was
suggested
to
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
record
was
vague
as
to
when
this
woman
was
taken
out
of
the
jail
and
the
record
is
not
vague
at
all.
she
was
there
from
the
9th
to
the
15th
and
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
was
ever
given
or
suggested.
second,
he
suggests
to
this
court
that
no
reports
were
made
after
the
state
of
california
ordered
its
own
officials
not
to
interrogate.
unknowing
at
the
time
that
a
spy
was
already
in
the
cell,
told
the
sheriff
to
stay
away
from
the
petitioner,
told
her
attorneys
to
stop
protecting,
peggy
fisk
says,
"i
made
reports
on
the
12th
and
partly
on
the
14th
after
that
injunction
was
issued
and
in
flat
contempt
of
the
municipal
court."
the
state
of
california
says
that
the
prosecution
never
suggested
to
the
jury
as
a
result
of
the
fisk
testimony
that
the
defendant
or
petitioner
had
a
continuing
motive
to
marry
arthwell
hayton.
from
its
own
appendix
in
the
final
argument
of
the
prosecutor
and
i
quote,
"she
testified
that
she
love
hayton,
that
she
wanted
to
marry
him.
she
testified
that
her
love
for
him
died
at
that
same
time
her
husband
died.
i'm
not
sure
what
that
would
have
to
do
with
it
at
any
rate."
that's
her
testimony
but
that's
not
what
she
told
the
girl
up
in
the
jail.
she
told
the
girl
up
in
the
jail
that
she
still
loved
hayton,
felt
that
he
would
come
to
her,
very
obviously
just
the
opposite
of
what
mr.
griffin
has
represented.
the
letter
which
chief
justice
has
alluded
to,
set
forth
in
part
in
our
brief
was
provoked
by
this
comment
in
a
reply
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner
after
the
state
had
opposed
certiorari
in
its
conclusion
on
page
7.
it
says
in
as
much
as
the
state
of
california
took
the
position
that
it
had
no
right
to
do
this,
to
put
spies
in
the
cell
as
long
as
they
did
not
overtly
interrogate,
which
had
statements
elicited
as
a
result
of
such
a
week
long
process
can
hardly
be
characterized
"entirely
spontaneous."
they
are
the
product
of
a
carefully
planned
and
executed
process
of
subtle
interrogation
and
trickery.
the
incredible
fact
that
the
highest
law
enforcement
officer
of
this
nation's
largest
state
still
regards
this
episode
as
proper
in
constitution
is
adequate
evidence
that
it
must
be
authoritatively
condemned
by
this
court.
i
have
heard
the
state
of
california
take
both
positions
today
but
it
is
perfectly
plain.
but
unless
that
condemnation
is
forthcoming,
peggy
fisk
will
have
more
work
in
san
bernardino
county
and
others
in
the
state
of
california.
thank
you.
mr.
lee
bailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
conviction
for
murder
in
the
first
degree.
in
the
course
of
procuring
that
conviction,
the
state
of
california,
subsequent
to
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner
and
subsequent
to
the
time
when
she
was
represented
by
counsel
overtly.
planted
in
her
cell
was
an
agent
of
the
prosecution,
a
policewoman,
posing
as
a
narcotics
addict
who
had
supposedly
been
confined
by
the
state,
in
order
to
overhear,
listen
and
stimulate
conversation
from
the
petitioner
which
it
hoped
it
would
be
able
to
use
to
incriminate
her
at
the
trial.
as
a
result
of
this
stimulation,
certain
statements
were
made
which
are
characterized
as
admissions.
the
petitioner
denied
her
guilt
but
admitted
the
motive
to
the
crime
at
least
as
to
its
existence.
this
is
not
a
usual
uxoricide.
the
precedent
in
this
case
was
a
dentist.
the
defendant
or
petitioner
his
wife
and
an
affair
had
been
going
on
involving
an
attorney
named
hayton.
the
death
occurred
as
a
result
of
a
fire
in
a
volkswagen
sedan
on
the
early
morning
hours
of
october
8,
1964.
as
of
the
moment
of
that
death,
there
was
on
the
record
a
series
of
decisions
dealing
with
this
very
problem
including
specifically
massiah
against
the
united
states,
escobedo
against
illinois
and
mcleod
against
ohio
applying
massiah
to
the
states.
within
24
hours
or
so,
this
petitioner
had
been
arrested.
the
police
filling
that
circumstantial
evidence,
pointed
to
the
fact
that
she
had
set
the
fire.
a
large
part
of
this
was
evidence
of
her
affair
with
the
attorney
named
hayton.
at
the
time
of
her
arrest,
she
was
met
at
the
jail
by
an
attorney
of
her
own
selection.
she
was
booked
for
murder.
the
police
attempted
to
interrogate
her.
counsel
objected
to
interrogation
following
arrest
and
following
representation
by
counsel.
in
order
to
protect
her
from
interrogation,
they
set
up
a
24-hour
watch
at
the
jail.
this
all
began
on
october
9th,
the
day
following
the
murder
--
mr.
lee
bailey
several
counsel
for
petitioner
--
counsel
being
unable
to
remain
awake
24
hours
must
have
some
of
his
colleagues
to
assist
him
in
the
watch
and
protect
the
petitioner.
at
11
p.m.
on
october
9th,
the
sheriff
whom
i
will
presume
had
some
knowledge
of
the
decisions
to
which
i
have
alluded
deliberately
inserted
passed
on
unsuspecting
counsel,
his
policewoman
undercover
agent
into
the
cell
of
petitioner.
her
instructions
were
to
listen
to
what
petitioner
said
and
the
state
in
its
argument
will
represent
that
she
in
no
way
interrogated
petitioner
but
was
merely
a
listening
post.
she
did
not
carry
a
recording
device
or
transmitter
of
any
kind.
mr.
lee
bailey
both
your
honor.
before
and
after
the
state
court
injunction
because
nobody
knew
at
the
time
the
injunction
was
issued
that
the
spy
was
in
the
cell
and
the
state
did
not
disclose
it
to
the
judge
who
gave
the
injunction.
among
the
things
which
the
undercover
agent
did
in
order
to
stimulate
remarks
by
the
petitioner
that
might
be
of
evidentiary
value
are
the
following:
first,
she
said
and
this
was
a
deliberate
lie
as
she
admitted.
she
had
overheard
man
from
the
district
attorney's
office
say
arthwell
hayton
came
in
today
and
blew
the
top
off
this
case.
she
then
presented
petitioner
with
a
newspaper
clipping
furnished
her
by
the
sheriff
or
his
agents
and
said,
the
publicity
is
ruining
you
in
this
case.
she
related
that
from
her
experience
as
a
criminal,
she
had
caused
a
distrust
lawyers.
suggested
that
petitioner
distrust
her
own
lawyer
and
further
suggested
that
the
sheriff
was
a
nice
man
and
should
be
trusted
by
petitioner
and
that
she
ought
to
talk
to
him.
mr.
lee
bailey
it
is
uncontradicted,
your
honor.
the
state
has
seen
fit
to
furnish
an
extensive
appendix
of
testimony
and
the
testimony
of
peggy
fisk
at
the
trial
is
included
verbatim.
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
that
these
things
were
done
and
that
they
were
done
at
the
specific
or
general
insistence
of
her
superiors,
the
sheriff
and
his
agents.
now,
mrs.
miller
did
say,
i
did
not
set
the
fire.
it
was
accidental.
and
she
has
stoutly
maintained
that
that
was
so.
but
she
also
said
that
she
was
still
in
love
with
arthwell
hayton
and
this
immediately
after
her
husband's
death
and
that
she
felt
that
arthwell
hayton
would
come
to
her
at
an
appropriate
time,
that
she
hope
to
take
the
insurance
money,
$100,000.00
which
was
carried
on
her
husband
and
take
the
children
to
europe
although
it
was
explained
that
this
was
to
avoid
being
crucified
by
the
society
that
had
put
her
to
trial.
at
the
time
of
trial,
the
government
proposed
to
use
this
tainted
evidence.
i
point
this
out
because
the
harmless
error
rule
which
is
at
issue
here
today
has
been
carved
out
in
my
judgment
and
from
a
reading
of
the
chapman
and
fahy
cases
and
the
notions
expressed
therein
in
order
to
avoid
summary
reversal
where
a
comparatively
minor
piece
of
evidence
is
led
in
through
a
blunder
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
or
the
part
of
the
judge
and
an
expensive
retrial
needs
to
be
avoided
because
no
substantial
prejudice
results.
but
i
do
point
out
that
these
were
two
deliberate
violations
at
two
separate
stages.
the
sheriff
by
circumventing
her
right
to
counsel
and
knowingly
injecting
a
spy
into
a
cell
where
she
was
confined
against
her
will.
and
second,
by
the
prosecutor
in
offering
testimony
which
he
well
knew
at
that
time
presuming
he
could
read
and
understand
the
principle
behind
the
massiah,
escobedo
and
mcleod,
well
knew
to
be
illicitly
gained
on
the
cheat
and
deceptively
nonetheless
wish
to
use
because
he
felt
that
would
show
her
guilt.
anomalously,
the
prosecutor
comes
before
this
court
and
says
that
the
evidence
was
unnecessary
and
not
prejudicial.
i
do
point
out
that
no
other
evidence
demonstrated
mrs.
miller's
alleged
continuing
love
for
the
paramour
hayton
after
her
husband's
death.
something
calculated
to
enrage
the
jury
and
presumably
since
it
took
three
days
for
this
jury
to
decide
the
case,
somebody
was
enraged
because
the
verdict
was
conviction.
at
the
time
that
the
evidence
was
offered,
the
defense
counsel
exhibited
some
surprise
and
said,
well,
i
have
never
interviewed
this
witness
as
it
is
my
right
and
i
object
that
this
was
done
in
the
lobby
but
it
was
done
on
the
record.
and
he
was
permitted
to
interview
the
witness.
but
prior
to
doing
so,
he
pointed
out
to
the
court,
this
evidence
is
inadmissible
and
he
cited
the
very
decisions
that
i
have
mentioned
here
and
also
people
against
dorado,
the
california
decision
on
the
escobedo
principle.
interviewed
the
witness
in
the
following
morning,
the
prosecutor
put
her
on
the
stand
but
before
that
happened,
the
defense
counsel
said
to
the
judge,
it
is
unfair
to
make
me
object
before
the
jury.
obviously,
they
might
draw
some
inference
that
i
am
keeping
out
a
confession
or
an
admission
that
the
crime
was
committed.
and
he
said
specifically
and
this
is
in
the
record,
judge
you
know
that
it
isn't
right
to
make
me
do
that.
and
the
judge
said,
we
must
put
her
on.
have
a
preliminary
foundation
laid
and
an
objection
at
the
proper
time,
it
cannot
be
done
in
the
absence
of
the
jury.
mr.
lee
bailey
i
understand
your
honor.
i'm
informed
by
my
colleague
that
page
42
is
the
correct
page.
mr.
lee
bailey
now,
because
the
counsel
always
carries
the
dual
burden
of
protecting
a
record
and
persuading
the
jury
of
his
client's
innocence
if
he
can,
this
counsel,
mr.
foley,
felt
that
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
that
he
must
object
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
was
incorrect
and
that
he
had
preserved
his
rights
for
appeal
as
i
suggest
he
did
and
therefore,
he
did
not
take
that
objection
in
order
not
i
think,
to
cause
the
jury
to
suspect
that
something
meaty
was
being
kept
from
him.
from
these
circumstances,
two
questions
had
been
accepted
by
this
court
for
a
review.
was
the
procedure
by
means
of
which
these
admissions
were
obtained
by
the
state
of
california
an
unconstitutional
violation
of
petitioner's
rights?
first
not
to
incriminate
herself
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
second
her
right
to
have
counsel
present
any
time
an
agent
of
the
government
interrogates
after
she
has
been
arrested
and
has
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment.
it
was
admitted
by
peggy
fisk,
the
undercover
agent
that
she
had
no
time
to
disclose
her
identity,
the
nature
of
her
office
and
did
not
advise
petitioner
that
she
had
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer
present
during
these
conversations.
if
it
is
a
violation,
the
question
is
then
taken
for
consideration
of
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
can
ever
be
a
harmless
error.
within
the
meaning
of
harmless
error
as
it
has
been
described
in
the
decision
in
fahy
against
connecticut
and
chapman
against
california.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
bailey
i
think,
your
honor,
we
can
always
insist
that
counsel
make
his
objection
for
the
record
at
the
sidebar
or
the
bench.
as
this
counsel
sought
to
do,
he
did
not
wish
to
forfeit
his
chance
to
win
a
jury
case
because
he
thought
the
judge
was
making
an
error.
he
would
rather
have
won
it
than
taking
this
appeal.
mr.
lee
bailey
very
clearly,
your
honor.
he
asked
not
to
be
made
to
object
in
front
of
the
jury.
he
did
object
for
the
record
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
lee
bailey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
rule
--
as
far
as
the
ruling
could
go
was
that
the
judge
would
have
to
rule
that
he
must
object
in
open
court.
he
did
not
rule
in
the
lobby
because
he
said
it's
not
before
me.
we
think
that
the
judge
was
mistaken.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
your
honor,
i
am.
i
think
the
principle
of
jackson
against
denno
is
applicable
and
i
think
that
because
jurors
do
not
necessarily
understand
the
machinations
of
the
rules
of
evidence.
if
counsel
wishes
to
state
his
position
which
is
probably
the
better
procedure
at
the
sidebar
instead
of
giving
a
speech
in
front
of
the
jury
and
to
make
his
objections
there
that
he
may
properly
do
so
and
the
judge
refuses
to
let
him
is
forcing
him
to
prejudice
his
case
in
front
of
the
jury
simply
because
they
don't
understand
rulings
of
law
and
we
should
presume
that
they
don't
at
least
not
in
our
cases.
now,
the
third
issue
was
offered
to
this
court
and
that
is
whether
or
not
assuming
that
it
were
found
that
harmless
error
could
occur
with
respect
to
admissions
whether
or
not
the
error
in
this
case
was
harmless.
that
issue
was
rejected
and
is
not
before
the
court
and
so
the
further
facts
of
the
case
which
are
recited
by
the
state
of
california
to
the
tune
of
about
250
pages,
trying
to
show
that
the
error
was
not
harmless,
will
not
be
alluded
to
by
the
petitioner
who
believes
that
issue
to
have
been
deemed
irrelevant.
the
question
then
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
i
take
it
to
the
state
of
california
although
it
vacillates
very
sharply
between
its
briefs
and
its
letters
to
this
court.
in
the
final
analysis
at
least
does
not
approve
this
deceptive
procedure
and
at
one
point
said
flatly
in
a
letter
the
court
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
briefs
and
which
is
part
of
the
record,
we
did
not
mean
to
say
that
this
was
not
an
unconstitutional
procedure,
we
condemn
it.
assuming
that
it
is
a
constitutional
violation
and
i
see
no
reason
to
quarrel
with
that
if
this
were
to
occur
today
very
obviously,
it
would
be
under
the
miranda
rule
that
we
are
not
favored
with
that
because
of
the
time
of
our
trial,
the
trial
was
in
january
of
1965.
nonetheless,
under
escobedo
and
under
massiah
which
involved
very
similar
circumstances
and
where
there
was
counsel
to
represent
the
defendant,
these
procedures
have
been
condemned
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
constitutional
violation
will
invite
this
kind
of
deception
every
time
law
enforcement
is
frustrated
by
the
rules
that
this
court
has
created
to
protect
individuals
who
are
subject
to
interrogation.
to
go
in
through
the
back
door
demolishes
any
value
in
creating
a
strong
front
door
and
that
is
exactly
what
would
happen.
i
see
perilously
little
difference
between
my
planting
a
spy
in
the
district
attorney's
office
to
pose
as
his
secretary
and
steal
his
files
and
the
sheriff
planting
a
spy
in
a
cell
where
my
client
is
improperly
held
if
she
is
innocent
or
being
properly
held
is
not
suppose
to
pay
a
penalty
because
she
can't
make
bail
and
taking
advantage
of
that
situation
in
a
cheatful
manner
obtaining
evidence
he
could
not
otherwise
get.
if
it
is
a
constitutional
violation
could
it
ever
be
harmless,
well,
the
court
has
held
i
think
pretty
uniformly
that
confessions
will
not
be
assumed
to
be
harmless
and
can
admissions
be
harmless.
this
type
of
admission
certainly
can
never
be
harmless
because
it
is
an
admission
to
the
motive
in
the
case.
the
murder
case
of
this
sort
is
on
shaky
ground
without
some
motive.
obviously,
if
the
state
had
been
faced
with
a
situation
where
two
happy
church
going
people
with
a
stable
family,
a
nice
community
position,
wound
up
in
a
burning
volkswagen
and
the
wife
escaped,
they
would
have
a
pretty
poor
case
for
murder.
mr.
lee
bailey
she
admitted
on
the
stand,
your
honor.
but
the
question
before
the
jury
was
did
she
on
the
night
in
question
have
sufficient
malice
in
her
heart
and
sufficient
motive
to
burn
her
husband
up,
her
contention
was
that
this
affair
had
terminated
and
was
not
a
motive.
the
only
piece
of
evidence
that
clearly
contradicted
her
testimony
was
the
testimony
of
peggy
fisk
saying,
i
still
love
arthwell
hayton.
if
the
jury
believed
that,
the
motive
was
a
continuing
thing.
if
they
did
not,
they
might
have
had
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
this
affair
had
terminated
and
having
had
that
dealt
the
result
would
have
been
quite
different.
if
the
court
were
to
say
that
there
can
be
harmless
error
in
admissions,
i
think
a
number
of
serious
problems
would
crop
up.
it
would
require
a
case
by
case
adjudication
and
an
onerous
burden.
it
would
tempt
law
enforcement
to
use
tactics
of
this
sort
in
the
fun
hope
that
perhaps
on
appeal,
this
would
be
deemed
to
one
of
the
exceptional
cases.
and
i
think
that
either
of
those
procedures
would
hurt
not
only
the
cause
of
justice
but
the
consistency
of
our
constitutional
principle.
now,
very
frankly,
the
best
rule
would
be
in
my
judgment
to
absolutely
deter
conduct
of
this
kind
because
i'm
very
fearful
of
the
analogous
case
where
the
evidence
is
not
used
and
the
counsel
never
learns
that
a
spy
has
been
used
in
the
cell.
would
the
fruits
of
those
conversations
if
they
led
to
other
evidence,
unconstitutionally
obtained,
be
improper
and
how
would
the
defendant
ever
know
it?
this
prosecutor
elected
to
use
the
evidence.
if
he
had
not,
the
petitioner
might
never
have
known
about
peggy
fisk
and
conceivably
could
have
suffered
damage
as
a
result
of
the
violation
never
recorded
and
never
brought
to
her
attention.
i
believe
that
it
should
be
stamped
out
of
that
level
but
if
not,
if
this
conduct
is
permissible,
if
law
enforcement
officers
may
make
the
attempt
to
put
spies
in
cells
because
some
people
can't
make
bail
because
the
charges
capital
or
because
they
don't
have
money
then
they
will
certainly
do
so
if
the
court
gives
one
wink
of
approval
on
it.
and
then
we
must
always
decide
whether
or
not
if
they
don't
use
the
evidence,
they
are
within
the
limits
of
constitutional
doctrine.
if
they
do
use
the
evidence,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
blunder,
the
kind
of
mistake
made
in
the
heat
of
trial
that
the
harmless
error
doctrine
was
made
to
accommodate.
it
is
certainly
true
that
after
a
three-month
trial
with
a
very
minor
slipped
of
the
tongue
which
is
corrected
by
the
court,
a
prosecutor
statement
might
be
deemed
harmless
error
even
though
it
fell
within
the
preview
of
a
constitutional
violation.
but
where
the
deception
and
the
violation
in
the
first
instance
was
deliberate
and
conceived
as
an
effort
to
get
around
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right,
and
then
where
the
use
of
the
evidence
by
a
knowing
lawyer
who
presumably
understood
the
law
and
was
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
reversal
to
have
his
jury
conviction
injected
that
evidence
over
objection
before
the
jury
then
we
have
a
two
stage
deliberate
violation
that
this
court
need
never
protect
with
a
harmless
error
exception.
mr.
lee
bailey
once
the
right
to
counsel
had
accrued,
once
a
formal
charge
had
been
lodged
then
i
would
say
any
informer
would
have
to
acquaint
the
defendant
with
his
identity
in
order
to
obtain
a
waiver
so
that
the
statements
could
be
used.
i
think
massiah
stands
for
that,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
your
honor
because
i
think
escobedo
does
that.
the
protection
of
counsel
has
to
arise
at
some
point.
i
think
in
the
view
of
this
court
disregarding
miranda
and
sticking
with
1964
as
these
law
enforcement
officers
confronted
the
situation
and
at
least
arose
--
mr.
lee
bailey
i
think
that
miranda
would
help
me
simply
because
it
does
nothing
to
dilute
escobedo
and
miranda
and
it
require
i
mean
--
and
massiah
and
it
require
warnings.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
if
this
technique
is
to
be
used,
the
technique
of
deception,
i
understood
the
massiah
case
is
condemning
that
technique
once
a
charge
had
been
made
and
the
counsel
had
been
brought
into
the
case
as
a
violation
through
the
secret
use,
an
imposition
on
an
unknowing
defendant,
a
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel
or
the
right
not
to
incriminate
oneself.
and
the
minute
exceptions
are
carved
out,
imaginative
law
enforcement
officers
are
going
to
find
new
ways
to
cloak
spies,
hoping
to
get
through
what
little
keyhole
maybe
left
in
the
room.
the
--
mr.
lee
bailey
hayton.
your
honor.
mr.
lee
bailey
she
said,
i
believe
your
honor
the
minute
that
cork
was
gone
--
mr.
lee
bailey
she
had
no
more
feeling.
yes.
mr.
lee
bailey
no,
i
think
not
your
honors.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
replied
brief,
if
she
had
killed
her
husband
for
the
purpose
of
marrying
hayton
as
it
appears
from
the
testimony
of
peggy
fisk,
then
in
this
event,
certainly
the
love
would
be
thought
to
continue
because
she
had
accomplished
the
purpose
and
come
closer
to
her
purpose.
but
she
says
that
spontaneously
because
of
the
impact
of
what
happened
to
her
husband
in
what
she
terms
an
accidental
situation,
whatever
feeling
she
had
for
this
attorney
dissipated
immediately.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes.
and
she
was
made
a
liar
if
the
jury
believed
peggy
fisk
and
i
assume
that
they
did
by
her
statement
a
few
days
later,
i
still
love
him
and
he
will
come
to
me,
which
was
the
most
damaging
of
all.
mr.
lee
bailey
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
bailey
if
she
had
killed
her
husband,
she
certainly
would
have
killed
him
before
the
moment
of
his
death.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
but
it
fully
appears
from
listening
to
the
testimony
of
peggy
fisk
that
this
petitioner
has
killed
her
husband
that
she's
accomplished
that
purpose.
she
hopes
to
be
acquitted
and
that
hayton
will
then
come
to
her.
she
says,
when
this
mess
is
cleaned
up,
he
will
come
to
me.
so
her
plan
is
a
continuing
one.
mr.
lee
bailey
oh
yes.
mr.
lee
bailey
she
always
denied
that
she
killed
her
husband.
mr.
lee
bailey
and
always
claim
that
it
was
an
accident.
and
the
case
was
--
mr.
lee
bailey
yes
she
did.
yes,
she
did.
mr.
lee
bailey
yes,
there's
no
question
about
this.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
four
minutes
as
i
see
them
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
lee
bailey
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
not
meet
the
legal
arguments
advanced
by
my
brothers
since
i
think
they
have
been
covered.
but
he
has
demonstrated
confusion
as
to
the
facts
that
i
think
worth
straightening
out.
first,
it
was
suggested
to
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
record
was
vague
as
to
when
this
woman
was
taken
out
of
the
jail
and
the
record
is
not
vague
at
all.
she
was
there
from
the
9th
to
the
15th
and
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
was
ever
given
or
suggested.
second,
he
suggests
to
this
court
that
no
reports
were
made
after
the
state
of
california
ordered
its
own
officials
not
to
interrogate.
unknowing
at
the
time
that
a
spy
was
already
in
the
cell,
told
the
sheriff
to
stay
away
from
the
petitioner,
told
her
attorneys
to
stop
protecting,
peggy
fisk
says,
"i
made
reports
on
the
12th
and
partly
on
the
14th
after
that
injunction
was
issued
and
in
flat
contempt
of
the
municipal
court."
the
state
of
california
says
that
the
prosecution
never
suggested
to
the
jury
as
a
result
of
the
fisk
testimony
that
the
defendant
or
petitioner
had
a
continuing
motive
to
marry
arthwell
hayton.
from
its
own
appendix
in
the
final
argument
of
the
prosecutor
and
i
quote,
"she
testified
that
she
love
hayton,
that
she
wanted
to
marry
him.
she
testified
that
her
love
for
him
died
at
that
same
time
her
husband
died.
i'm
not
sure
what
that
would
have
to
do
with
it
at
any
rate."
that's
her
testimony
but
that's
not
what
she
told
the
girl
up
in
the
jail.
she
told
the
girl
up
in
the
jail
that
she
still
loved
hayton,
felt
that
he
would
come
to
her,
very
obviously
just
the
opposite
of
what
mr.
griffin
has
represented.
the
letter
which
chief
justice
has
alluded
to,
set
forth
in
part
in
our
brief
was
provoked
by
this
comment
in
a
reply
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner
after
the
state
had
opposed
certiorari
in
its
conclusion
on
page
7.
it
says
in
as
much
as
the
state
of
california
took
the
position
that
it
had
no
right
to
do
this,
to
put
spies
in
the
cell
as
long
as
they
did
not
overtly
interrogate,
which
had
statements
elicited
as
a
result
of
such
a
week
long
process
can
hardly
be
characterized
"entirely
spontaneous."
they
are
the
product
of
a
carefully
planned
and
executed
process
of
subtle
interrogation
and
trickery.
the
incredible
fact
that
the
highest
law
enforcement
officer
of
this
nation's
largest
state
still
regards
this
episode
as
proper
in
constitution
is
adequate
evidence
that
it
must
be
authoritatively
condemned
by
this
court.
i
have
heard
the
state
of
california
take
both
positions
today
but
it
is
perfectly
plain.
but
unless
that
condemnation
is
forthcoming,
peggy
fisk
will
have
more
work
in
san
bernardino
county
and
others
in
the
state
of
california.
thank
you.
