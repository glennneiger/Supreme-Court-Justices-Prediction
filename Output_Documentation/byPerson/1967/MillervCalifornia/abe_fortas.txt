justice
abe
fortas
before
you
reach
that
mr.
bailey
on
the
problem
of
failure
to
object.
it's
always
--
practically
always
true,
isn't
it,
that
an
objection
to
the
admission
of
evidence,
it
can
be
thought
to
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
we
accepted
that
as
a
reason
excusing
the
failure
to
make
objection,
i
don't
know
how
it
could
ever
insist
on
it
really.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you
say
that
is
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
that
--
i
know
but
he
didn't
press
for
a
ruling.
there
was
no
ruling
on
this
because
as
i
understand
it,
because
the
judge
said
he'll
have
to
make
it
in
front
of
the
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
so
really,
what
you're
urging
us
to
hold
is
that
the
judges'
refusal
to
permit
objection
to
be
made
and
therefore
the
judge's
failure
to
make
a
ruling
on
the
objection
made
at
the
sidebar
was
excuse,
was
an
adequate
excuse
for
the
objection
not
being
made
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
state
--
the
state
brings
to
our
attention
a
great
deal
of
evidence
in
addition
to
the
petitioner's
statement
in
which
she
supposedly
--
which
supposedly
indicates
that
she
was
having
this
relationship
with
the
other
man.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
she
killed
her
husband,
she
would
have
done
it
before
the
moment
of
death.
justice
abe
fortas
i
said
if
she'd
killed
her
husband,
she
would
have
done
it
before
the
moment
of
his
death.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
my
point.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
looking
for
is
motive
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
of
the
time
she
allegedly
killed
him.
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
the
state
of
california
do
with
respect
to
a
situation
like
this?
there
is
a
law
in
california
that
in
your
judgment
that
--
where
there
is
this
kind
of
live
and
stated
fact
that
is
used
by
an
undercover
agent
planted
in
the
cell?
but
that
is
prejudicial
error
unless
it's
offset
by
the
totality
of
the
record
or
something
like
that
or
does
california
just
condoned
this
sort
of
thing.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
from
my
own
information.
is
there
any
procedure
by
which
the
police
are
notified
of
something
like
this
and
notified
of
your
officer's
judgment
about
it?
what
happens,
just
nothing?
justice
abe
fortas
in
your
office,
can
they
do
a
sort
of
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
i
asked
that
--
may
i
ask
because
i
suppose
your
theory
is
at
the
presence
of
a
person
in
the
cell
with
the
person
who
is
on
the
charge
of
having
committed
a
crime
is
in
itself
an
inducement
to
speak
even
though
the
undercover
agent
in
the
cell
doesn't
volunteer
a
thing
that
the
very
presence
may
be
an
inducement
to
the
other
person
to
speak
and
i
suppose
the
subject
that
most
contends
interest
to
the
arrested
person
is
his
own
wife.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
you
heard
your
adversary's
statement
about
the
sidebar
conversation.
was
there
--
as
you
remember
though,
as
you
understand
the
record,
was
there
any
time
they
request
that
the
judge
rule
on
the
objection
at
the
sidebar
and
was
there
a
direct
refusal
of
the
judge
to
rule?
justice
abe
fortas
and
frankly
there's
something
in
effect
that
i
would
object
to
it
or
will
object
to
it
or
something
like
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
so
your
point
is
that
no
objection
was
made
either
at
sidebar
or
otherwise?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
proper
objection
had
been
made,
the
alleged
error
that
now
exists
in
this
record
could
have
been
avoided.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
not
suggesting
one
way
or
the
other
that
this
was
deliberately
induced
error
or
not
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
objection
was
not
made
and
therefore
the
state
was
deprived
an
opportunity
to
avoid
this
alleged
error.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
you
should
say
in
view
of
all
this
that
mr.
bailey
was
not
defense
counsel
at
the

was
he?
