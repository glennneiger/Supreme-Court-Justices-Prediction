justice
potter
stewart
alright.
you
know
where
that
is
in
the
appendix
here?
i
find
a
little
difficult
to
read
the
appendix
because
it's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
and
i
thank
you
for
the
time.
very
well.
justice
potter
stewart
back
to
the
harmless
error
point
for
a
moment.
this
witness,
fisk,
testified
that
the
defendant
told
her
that
she
was
still
in
love
with
layton
or
hayton
whatever
his
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
that
certainly
provides
what
motive
there
was,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
immediately
upon
his
death.
justice
potter
stewart
she
denied
to
fisk
that
she
had
killed
her
husband,
did
she
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
haven't
misunderstood
you.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
fisk
--
and
the
witness
fisk
so
testified
at
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
defendant
had
denied
to
fisk
that
the
defendant
had
killed
her
husband.
justice
potter
stewart
she's
professional.
she
says
she
did
work
in
fresno
undercover.
she
has
been
between
jobs
and
now
she
is
charged,
she
is
negotiating
with
another
county
for
similar
work.
justice
potter
stewart
going
back
on
what
you
told
us
that
the
--
on
the
morning
that
the
witness
fisk
actually
began
to
testify
that
it's
clear
that
the
counsel
would
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
object
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
well,
now
the
evening
before
and
i'm
reflecting
it
on
page
47
in
the
record,
in
the
appendix.
the
court
very
clearly
indicated
as
i
read
it
that
that
would
not
have
been
possible.
i
think
there
would
have
to
be.
i
don't
see
how
that
could
be
done
in
the
absence
of
the
jury.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
court
changed
its
line
overnight
or
perhaps
i
misunderstood
what
you
told
us.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
to
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
did
fisk
testify
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
if
fisk
testified
that
the
defendant
told
her,
fisk
that
the
defendant
had
given
up
all
hope
of
marrying
hayton.
justice
potter
stewart
what
happened?
i
mean
that
didn't
help
her
very
much
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
the
undercover
testimony
in
fact
testified
that
the
defendant
had
confessed
of
course
then
that
would
have
been
--
it
could
have
formed
a
testimony
of
that
but
that
doesn't.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
your
point.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
you
know
where
that
is
in
the
appendix
here?
i
find
a
little
