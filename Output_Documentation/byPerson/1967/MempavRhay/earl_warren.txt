chief

what
are
those
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
don't
remember
it's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice

suppose
a
--
suppose
this
had
been
a
suspended
sentence
as
distinguished
from
probation,
could
the
defendant
have
appealed
that
time
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
suppose
under
that
--
under
the
argument
that's
been
made
here
that
the
judge
could
or
the
petition
for
revocation
would
change
the
conditions
of
probation
again
put
in
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
hearing
of
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
i
would
wonder
if
the
judge
couldn't
say.
well,
now,
i
don't
want
to
send
you
in
the
penitentiary.
this
hadn't
been
a
terribly
serious
violation
of
probation
but
i
do
think
that
you're
ought
to
be
punished
for
it,
so
i'm
going
to
send
you
back
to
the
county
jail
for
six
months
again
as
a
term
of
your
probation.
i
suppose
he
could
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
--
isn't
what
you've
been
arguing
in
effect
for
two
trial
connection
on
why
they're
trying
to
put
him
on
probation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
he
be
entitled
to
be
confronted
by
the
witnesses
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
schwab,
before
you
sit
down,
i
want
you
to
know
that
the
court
is
--
conscious
to
the
fact
that
you
assumed
the
burden
of
this
case
by
assignment
from
this
court
and
that
we
consider
that
a
real
public
service.
we
are
comforted
greatly
by
the
fact
that
lawyers
are
willing
to
accept
assignments
of
this
kind
and
willing
to
devote
their
time
as
a
public
service.
so
we
appreciate
it
and
we
thank
you
for
your
service.
and
mr.
way,
i
want
you
to
know
that
we
likewise
appreciate
the
diligent
and
fair
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
the
state
of
washington
in
this
case.
