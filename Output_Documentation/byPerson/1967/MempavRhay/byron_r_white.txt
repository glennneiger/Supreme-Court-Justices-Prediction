justice
byron
r.
white
when
would
he
be
eligible
for
parole?
justice
byron
r.
white
ready
to
dispose
of
this
parole
reduced,
if
he
was
retained?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
(voice
overlap)
is
there
a
full
blown
hearing
with
witnesses
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
still
a
hearsay
matter
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
would
follow
holding
counsel
requirements.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
relying
on
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
appealable
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
as
an
independent
ground
in
both
of
these
cases
that
even
if
you
don't
apply
down
any
rule
of
requiring
counsel
in
probation
revocation
hearing
as
such,
that
that
in
effect
as
a
sentencing
as
a
completion
of
the
sentencing
process
that
you
must
have
counsel
at
least
for
that
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
in
your
case
i
suppose,
this
took
the
equal
protection
route
and
then
what
the
court
does
is
to
permit
people
with
the
means
to
have
a
lawyer,
let's
say
people
without
means
must
have
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
don't
permit
people
with
the
means
to
confront
witnesses,
there's
no
denial
of
equal
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
in
washington
--
i'll
just
go
back
for
a
minute.
what
happens
in
washington
when
as
in
the
case
like
this,
there's
no
right
to
appeal
at
the
time
the
probation
order
is
entered
but
the
defendant
may
appeal
when
his
probation
is
revoked,
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
on
appeal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
counsel
is
appointed.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
generally
have
the
right
to
appeal
on
your
stage
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
take
the
course
that
this
is
a
sentencing,
therefore
the
counsel
then
you
approach
it
as
a
sentencing
procedure.
this
is
where
the
judge
had
a
probation
report
on
--
you
don't
have
the
question
of
confrontation
and
things
like
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
look
at
it
as
a
sentencing
procedure,
you
have
the
right
to
counsel
but
you
normally
don't
have
another
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
trial
by
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
make
both
arguments.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yeah
but
they
don't
appoint
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
contention
that
all
jurisdiction
should
--
justice
byron
r.
white
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
that
all
jurisdictions
must
do
it
on
probation
revocation.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
--
can
you
tell
us
anything
under
the
law
of
your
state
which
would
make
the
holding
in
this
case
applicable
to
parole
revocation?
is
there
any
--
do
you
have
an
approach
towards
parole
revocation
in
your
state
which
would
significantly
distinguish
them
from
probation
revocation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
say
we
took
the
sixth
amendment
ground
right
across
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
this
is
a
--
that
this
is
a
situation
which
the
counsel
is
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
mean
--
is
it
parole
revocations
wouldn't
be
done
administratively.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
but
the
holding
would
mean
that
they
wouldn't
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
depends
on
how
you
said
there's
a
right
to
counsel.
if
you
said
that
any
hearing
involving
a
man's
liberty,
there's
a
right
to
counsel.
i
think
that
would
apply
and
they
could
continue
to
do
this
before
a
board
but
they
would
have
to
appoint
counsel
as
well
as
permit
retained
counsel.
but
i
don't
think
that
you
would
be
required
to
form
an
opinion
which
would
move
this
procedure
into
the
courtroom.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
argument
would
then
apply
also
i
suppose
to
granting
parole
liberty.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
--
the
parole
board
really
would
take
it
in
consideration?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
parole
boards
would
take
it
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
set
out
in
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
somewhere
in
the
record
the
actual
conditions
of
his
probation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
conditions
of
--
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
this
--
to
make
such
report
is
required
with
the
other
supervisions
of
state
parole
officers
during
the
period
of
his
probation.
i
suppose
the
act
--
how
would
he
know
what
conduct
he
--
how
he
is
--
what
behavior
would
get
his
behavior
revoked.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
have
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
those
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
give
what?
i
suppose
we
could
find
them
somewhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
lot
of
them
it
seems
to
me
as
a
--
they've
put
conditions
on
them
that
fall
far
short
of
a
committing
criminal
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
furthermore,
the
criminal
acts
themselves
might
qualify
under
the
lesser
provisions
like
don't
associate
with
the
wrong
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
don't
live
a
bad
life
or
live
a
temperate
life
and
things
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
would
he
be
eligible
for
parole?
justice
