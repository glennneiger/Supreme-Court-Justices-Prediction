mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes,
he
did
your
honor
but
the
written
order
once
he
signed
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
my
opposing
counsel
has
stated
to
you,
the
issue
in
these
cases
concerns
the
problem
of
the
right
to
counsel
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
the
probation
revocation
hearings
in
the
state
of
washington
followed
by
the
imposition
of
sentence.
now,
i
think
perhaps
for
a
moment,
i
like
to
dwell
on
how
these
issues
arose
and
were
disposed
of
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
mempa
in
a
pro
se
petition,
contended
that
in
as
much
as
he
was
not
accompanied
or
did
not
have
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
the
revocation
of
his
probation
and
the
imposition
of
sentence
that
his
sixth
amendment
rights
were
violated
under
the
constitution
of
united
states
and
under
article
1,
section
10
of
our
state
constitution.
the
supreme
court,
as
mr.
schwab
has
stated,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
held
an
en
banc
hearing
in
the
case
having
first
heard
the
matter
by
a
department
of
the
court,
and
then
it
was
ordered,
heard
en
banc.
the
majority
opinion
decided
on
the
question
on
due
process
grounds
alone,
the
dissent
touches
upon
due
process,
equal
protection
and
the
sixth
amendment
considerations.
in
walkling,
mr.
walkling's
attorney
contended
wholly
that
his
due
process
rights
had
been
violated.
the
counsel
in
their
brief
brought
up
in
a
five
sentence
suggestion
in
the
end
of
their
brief
that
equal
protection
was
violated.
the
matter
was
decided
by
order
of
the
supreme
court
finding
that
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
mempa
control.
now,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
historical
development
of
the
due
process
clause
in
this
court
that
a
number
of
protections
have
been
accorded
to
defendants
when
a
question
is
one
of
guilt
or
innocence
but
the
significant
difference
between
these
case
and
the
cases
that
have
gone
before
gideon,
griffin
versus
illinois,
gault.
the
issue
that
was
there
was
one
of
whether
or
not
the
person
was
guilty
of
the
crime
which
he's
been
charged
or
as
in
gault
whether
or
not
the
person
had
committed
the
act
of
delinquency.
the
case
here
is
one
in
which
the
defendant
has
been
convicted.
his
conviction
is
having
committed
the
crime,
has
been
constitutionally
established.
he
had
his
counsel
and
presumably
upon
the
advice
of
counsel,
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
or
he
was
convicted
upon
the
finding
of
guilty
by
a
jury.
now,
this
is
somewhat
different
from
the
cases
where
a
defendant
must
come
before
a
court
without
a
counsel.
here
as
mr.
schwab
has
indicated,
the
hearings
are
relatively
informal.
there
are
no
pleading
problems.
there
is
no
complaint
information
or
indictment
or
the
intricacies
of
those
things.
there,
the
evidence
is
sometimes
of
a
hearsay
nature.
there
are
affidavits.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
in
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
in
the
mempa
case
mr.
justice
marshall.
there
was
attached
to
the
prosecutor's
motion
an
affidavit
concerning
the
facts
of
the
burglary
of
the
used
car
lot
by
mr.
mempa.
the
theft
to
the
television
sets,
some
radios
and
three
rifles.
and
mr.
mempa
was
asked
whether
the
affidavit
was
read
off
the
court.
mr.
mempa
was
asked
whether
or
not
this
--
there
are
allegations
of
what
he'd
been
accused
were
true.
the
answer
in
the
affirmative,
yes
they
were.
that
was
the
nature
of
the
evidence
there.
now
walkling,
there
is
no
record.
we
know
not
what
transpired
there
but
we
do
know
that
there
were
i
believe
14
charges
of
forgery
and
14
charges
of
grand
larceny.
he
absconded
his
parole
by
going
to
another
jurisdiction.
he
was
wanted
for
a
period
of
almost
a
year.
a
bench
warrant
was
outstanding
for
his
production.
and
these
were
the
things
i'm
satisfied,
came
before
the
court
in
his
area
but
as
mr.
schwab
have
said
that
there
was
no
