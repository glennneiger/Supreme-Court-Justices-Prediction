what
about
his
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

black
as
a
matter
of
attack?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
claim
that
--
i
don't
know
whose
attacking
the
judgment
in
habeas
corpus
are
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer
in
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
a
habeas
corpus,
he
even
has
collateral
attack.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
leave
out
--
what
kind
of
proceeding.
and
of
course
the
defendant
always
thinks
he'd
try
to
get
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
each
attack
he
makes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
then
when
you
appoint
a
lawyer,
you've
got
to
be
careful
that
--
they
have
to
be
careful
if
he
actually
represents
anyone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
habeas
corpus,
isn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
how
many
habeas
corpus
cases
there
are
in
a
year
exactly
now?
have
you
looked
that
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
probation?
how
many?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
mr.
schwab
in
the
mempa's
case,
he
has
already
served
eight
years,
suppose
you
can
prevail
what
happens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
that
time
--
it
was
ten
years
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
trial
in
that
theory
by
the
man
entitled
all
the
bill
of
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
this
in
effect
punishing
a
man
the
guilt's
of
other
crime.
that's
in
effect
on
what
you
said.
the
judge
takes
him
into
consideration,
decided
that
he
is
guilty
and
then
puts
on
this
punishment
assuming
that
he
did
not
confer
to
the
board.
how
can
you
start
by
just
giving
them
a
lawyer
by
--
he
is
entitled
to
a
jury
and
an
indictment
in
all
the
other
petitions
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
didn't
have
them
in
connection
with
the
discipline.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
because
his
--
the
judge
got
to
do
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
is
guilty
of
a
new
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
there
be
any
system
under
which
a
man
was
not
entitled
to
a
lawyer
who
was
being
tried
and
can
be
sentenced
for
ten
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
--
yes,
then
why
wouldn't
this
man
be
entitled
--
why
is
he
be
more
entitled
to
a
lawyer
than
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
--
and
the
jury
is
essential?
it's
written
in
the
constitution
as
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
its
trying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
it's
trying
him
for
the
guilt
of
a
new
crime
and
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
pick
and
choose
between
the
bill
of
rights'
protection
that
a
man
which
was
tried
for
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
but
many
times
i
understood
you
to
say
at
large.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
(voice
overlap)
all
depends
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
that's
right
and
i
suppose
the
state
decided
to
appeal
probation
law
entirely,
what
would
have
been?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
suppose
we
put
all
of
those
writings
on
them
and
they
decided
they
don't
want
anything
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
because
i
don't
know
where
the
line
has
to
be
drawn.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
haven't
agreed
with
the
people
who
wrote
the
constitution
that
one
of
the
most
important
things
for
a
man
in
this
nation
has
a
jury
trial
when
he
is
tried
for
a
crime.
i
don't
see
why
he's
not
entitled
to
the
jury
trial
when
it
was
put
in
there
for
that
purpose.
if
he
is
entitled
to
have
--
on
the
bill
of
rights
protection
--
i
don't
know
what
the
line
is
in
there
or
what
we
are
up
against.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
use,
yes,
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
maybe
so.
i'm
not
saying
he
shouldn't
but
i'm
just
asking
why
it
wouldn't
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
we
decided
a
case
several
years
ago.
i
don't
think
generally
in
the
field
of
probation
that
we
had
a
question
that
as
the
judge
could
use
it
if
it
had
not
been
proceeded
by
cross-examination
of
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that,
william,
williams?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that
based
on,
that
holding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
more
technical?
no,
not
more
technical,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
consider
any
of
those
technically,
the
bill
of
rights
protection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
discussed
that
case
in
your
brief?
justice

i
think
it
is
on
the
bearing.

yes.
