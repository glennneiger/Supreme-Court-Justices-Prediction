justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
see,
is
that
the
maximum
(inaudible)
on
that
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
get
any
credit
on
these
ten
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
i
wonder
did
he
get
on
the
ten
years
any
credit
for
the
30
days
he
previously
served
or
any
of
the
time
he
was
on
probation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
had
ten
years
from
the
day
that
he
was
brought
back
in
his
probation
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he's
been
there
now
for
eight
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
since
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened
to
walkling?
did
he
get
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
within
the
maximum?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
initially,
you
get
three
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
--
i
think
you
said
that
you
not
--
it
depends
on
the
judge
whether
one
is
allowed
with
the
help
of
retaining
the
counsel
on
a
revocation
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
schwabb.
you
must
prevail
on
both
or
neither
of
these
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can't
distinguish
it
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
mr.
schwab.
can
you
help
us
whether
this
procedure
in
your
state
has
counterpart
tells
where
particularly
in
the
features
that
there's
no
final
sentence
until
after
revocation
of
parole
and
no
appeal
until
judgment
has
been
entered
after
revocation
of
parole.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
the
person
if
--
if
you're
right
that
--
really,
this
is
a
sentencing
procedure
part
of
the
main
criminal
prosecutions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
gideon
applies
at
that
stage
as
it
does
another
stages.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
suggesting.
if
you
prevail
on
that
analysis,
that
probably
won't
help
us
very
much
and
the
state
procedures
maybe
different.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
this
is
the
terminal
pledge
of
the
criminal
prosecution
under
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
terminal
stage
of
the
criminal
prosecution
under
your
system
assignment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
you
argue
for
right
to
counsel
independently
of
the
washington
practice
of
this
being
the
terminal
stage
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i'd
like
to
hear
you
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
townsend
and
burke.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
know
what
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
schwab
of
course
as
to
all
of
these
reasons,
there
must
be
a
judicial
proceeding
or
a
proceeding
before
a
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
again,
perhaps
it's
not
fair
to
ask
you
about
other
practices
in
other
states.
have
you
have
heard
of
an
administrative
revocation
of
probation
as
distinguished
from
administrative
revocation
of
parole?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
take
it
mr.
schwab.
if
we
would
agree
with
you,
the
revocation
stage
was
a
step
also
in
the
criminal
procedure
--
proceeding.
you
wouldn't
have
to
make
this
argument
which
in
effect
is
one
that
this
is
a
critical
stage
proceeding,
would
you?
are
you
arguing
alternatively
that
it's
a
step
of
the
criminal
proceeding
in
any
event
and
therefore
as
--
at
the
trial
itself,
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
or
even
if
it's
not
a
step,
nevertheless
take
critical
stage
sufficiently
that
hasn't
weighed
in
these
other
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
said
that
there's
a
right
to
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
said
there
had
to
be
a
right
to
counsel,
wouldn't
that
automatically
--
wouldn't
it
follow
then
that
parole
revocations
too
would
have
to
be
before
judges
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
mr.
schwab.
your
only
problem
here
is
to
sway
this
--
at
least
constitutionally
have
a
right
to
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
we
--
can
we
consider
this
without
thinking
of
some
of
the
other
things,
jury
trial
for
example?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it
doesn't.
but
where
do
you
stop
if
we
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
mean
involving
jury
trial?
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
confrontation.
i
guess
you
will
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
he
gets
it
this
way
and
he
takes
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
matter
what
time
he
says,
it's
not
credit
even
though
he
has
been
sentenced
to
ten
years
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
but
do
you
rely
on
the
sixth
amendment
hearing
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
heard
the
--
do
you
have
a
citation
on
the
washington
statute
which
imposes
the
--
or
describes
the
conditions
of
probation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

let

is

the
