justice

does
he
escape
to
get
a
better
law
library
facility?
justice
abe
fortas
was
walkling
subsequently
tried
for
forgery
or
whatever
it
was?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
leads
to
a
certain
officials
in
the
administration
of
the
courts,
i
gather.
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
but
could
walkling
and
mempa
have
appeal
when
they
were
first
put
on
probation
because
they
were
given
minimum
sentences?
justice
abe
fortas
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
given
minimum
sentences
of
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
to
have
both,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
a
time
in
jail
but
if
you
just
--
if
they
just
say,
you
have
to
spend
30
days
in
jail
then
it
says,
the
written
word
anyway
is
that
there
is
no
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
your
purpose
of
this
minimum
--
of
this
30
days
or
whatever
it
was
in
walkling's
case.
they
put
him
on
probation
but
you
said
you've
got
to
spend
30
days
in
jail.
is
that
for
processing?
justice

he
can
get
some
training

the
profession.
justice
abe
fortas
he

justice
abe
fortas
does
your
argument
apply
equally
to
the
sentencing
trace
of
a
hearing
and
ordinary
procedure?
let's
take
a
hypothetical
case.
the
man
is
represented
by
a
counsel
during
a
trial
and
the
judge
is
--
and
the
jury
comes
in
with
the
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
judge
says
--
sets
down
the
proceeding
for
sentencing
three
days
later.
and
the
man
comes
in
and
says,
i
don't
have
counsel.
my
counsel
disappeared
or
resigned
or
something
and
i
want
a
counsel
at
this
time.
does
your
argument
equally
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
he's
entitled
to
counsel
under
the
principles
of
gideon
and
so
on?
justice
abe
fortas
at
the
sentencing
phase.
justice
abe
fortas
now
do
you
--
my
question
to
you
really
is,
do
you
use
that
line
of
thinking,
that
line
of
analysis,
townsend
against
burke
to
support
your
position
in
this
proceeding
or
they
arrest
it
solely
on
the
fact
that
a
testimony
is
taken
at
this
so
called
deferred
probation
or
probation
revocation
proceedings.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
schwab,
am
i
correct
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
where
imposition
of
the
sentence
is
suspended
it
can
be
suspended
or
deferred
for
only
the
maximum
period
for
which
the
defendant
might
have
been
imprisoned?
justice
abe
fortas
actually,
i
suppose
when
his
probation
is
revoked
that
a
board
that
supervises
how
long
he's
got
to
stay
in
(inaudible)
proceeds
thereafter
on
the
assumption
that
he
has
committed
the
alleged
crime
for
which
--
upon
the
base
of
which
probation
was
revoked.
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
(voice
overlap)
--
there's
been
no
trial
and
no
judicial
determination
that
he
committed
a
second
crime
that
is
to
say
the
one
alleged
by
the
probation
officer
and
on
the
basis
of
which
the
probation
was
revoked.
i
assume
that
the
board
would
just
take
it
for
granted
since
the
judge
revoked
his
probation
on
that
basis
that
he
really
committed
it.
