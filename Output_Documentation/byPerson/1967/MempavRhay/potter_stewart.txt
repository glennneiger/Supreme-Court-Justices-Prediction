justice
potter
stewart
mr.
schwab,
you
said
the
probation
officer
took
the
stand
and
testify
as
the
--
as
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
burglary.
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
assume
that
probation
officer
was
an
eye
witness
to
the
burglary.
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
he
testify.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
just
kind
of
a
summary
of
his
investigation
or
whatever
that
investigation
might
have
been,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
and
who
was
the
--
who
initiated
this
proceeding
to
revoke
probation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
prosecutor
files
a
motion,
does
he
end
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
some
indication
there
--
in
this
case
of
a
hearing
on
a
quite
separate
non-related
problem
as
it
is
having
to
do
with
the
waiver
of
the
juvenile
court's
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
what
happened
to
that
aspect
to
this

stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should
hold
this
or
that
i'm
not
going
to
move
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
washed
out.
justice
potter
stewart
and
by

think

never
trialed

a
charge
of
burglary.

potter
stewart

other
or
additional
--?

stewart
