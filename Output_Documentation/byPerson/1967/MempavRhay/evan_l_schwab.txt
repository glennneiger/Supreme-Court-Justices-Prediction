mr.
evan
l.
schwab
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
representing
the
petitioners
jerry
douglas
mempa
and
william
walkling
in
both
case
number
16
and
case
number
22.
we
filed
a
joint
brief
covering
both.
these
cases
present
a
virtually
identical
issue
to
this
court,
namely,
whether
or
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
confers
the
right
to
counsel
during
probation
revocation
proceedings
and
at
the
sentencing
which
follows.
the
washington
supreme
court
held
that
these
petitioners
did
not
have
a
right
to
counsel
when
they
were
held
into
a
hearing
which
was
presided
over
by
a
superior
court
judge
where
they
were
opposed
by
a
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
and
were
the
basic
issue
with
their
continued
eligibility
for
freedom.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse
those
decisions.
since
they
present
identical
issues
with
only
differences
in
facts,
we
ask
leave
of
the
court
to
consolidate
these
cases
for
argument.
my
opponent
mr.
way
joins
in
this
request.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
would
like
to
add
half
an
hour
for
each
case,
giving
an
hour
for
me
and
then
give
mr.
way
an
hour
on
this
too.
turning
to
the
facts
first
in
number
16,
mempa
versus
rhay,
when
jerry
douglas
mempa
was
17,
he
was
arrested
in
charge
with
the
crime
of
burglary.
an
attorney
was
appointed
to
represent
him
and
he
entered
the
charge
--
excuse
me.
this
was
joyriding.
it
was
a
burglary
charge
in
walkling.
he
was
charged
with
joyriding,
which
in
the
state
of
washington
essentially
is
stealing
a
car.
people
in
this
age
bracket
frequently
are
involved
in
this
offense.
an
attorney
was
appointed
and
the
matter
came
on
for
trial
and
he
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
mempa
was
sentenced
to
30
days
in
the
county
jail
as
a
condition
for
a
deferred
sentence
on
the
charge
of
joyriding
and
such
was
not
entered.
the
order
which
was
entered
by
the
superior
court
judge
is
what
we
call
in
washington,
an
order
of
deferred
sentence.
it's
also
called
probation
in
state
of
washington.
he
was
placed
under
the
supervision
of
the
washington
state
board
of
prison
terms
and
paroles
and
this
is
prior
to
obey
their
rules.
four
months
later,
jerry
mempa
was
arrested
and
brought
back
before
the
court
on
the
prosecutor's
motion
to
revoke
the
probation
which
had
been
granted
earlier.
he
was
still
17
years
of
age
and
he
was
accompanied
to
the
hearing
only
by
his
stepfather.
he
was
not
asked
if
he
wanted
an
attorney.
he
was
not
asked
to
have
an
attorney
and
nothing
was
said
about
the
attorney
who
had
represented
him
four
months
earlier.
the
prosecutor
read
the
motion
to
revoke
probation
in
the
matter
--
then
got
underway.
the
court
asked
jerry
mempa
if
he
had
been
involved
in
this
alleged
new
violation
of
probation
which
in
this
case
was
burglary.
he
answered
in
the
affirmative.
at
that
point,
the
probation
officer
took
the
stand
and
testified
as
to
the
facts
concerning
this
alleged
burglary
that
jerry
mempa
was
involved
in.
the
judge
asked
the
probation
officer
if
it
was
not
true
that
mempa
had
originally
denied
this
charge
when
he
was
arrested
but
subsequently
admitted
it.
the
probation
officer
said
yes.
at
that
point,
the
judge
announces
that
he
was
revoking
probation.
he
signed
the
order
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
he
was
not
your
honor.
this
is
a
common
practice
in
washington
hearing.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
practice
in
our
state
and
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
prosecutor,
excuse
me.
the
probation
officer
testifies
to
the
facts.
it's
all
hearsay.
he
may
have
interviewed
the
witnesses
who
were
eyewitnesses.
he
may
have
interviewed
the
policemen
who
were
familiar
with
the
case.
he
may
have
heard
taken
a
statement
from
the
accused.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
this
is
the
way
it's
commonly
done
in
our
state.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
eyewitnesses
are
rarely
brought
in.
there's
rarely
a
chance
to
confront
them.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
all
we
have
on
the
record
is
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
filed
a
motion
to
revoke.
they
way
it
usually
works
if
the
man
is
arrested
or
a
complaint
is
made
by
the
probation
officer.
if
it's
a
new
crime,
it
would
originate
with
the
police.
if
it's
someone
who
calls
a
probation
officer,
he
would
initiate
it
by
calling
the
prosecutor
and
asking
that
this
proceeding
be
convened.
at
that
point,
the
men
are
generally
arrested
and
the
proceeding
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
the
prosecutor
represents
the
state
in
one
of
these
hearings.
jerry
mempa
was
not
given
a
chance
to
cross-examine
the
probation
officer.
he
was
not
asked
to
make
a
statement
in
his
own
behalf.
an
order
was
simply
entered
revoking
the
probation
and
sentencing
him
to
a
term
of
ten
years
in
the
state
penitentiary
on
that
original
charge
of
joyriding.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
it
is,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
the
state
of
washington
and
this
is
generally
up
to
the
state
board
of
prison
terms
and
paroles.
ordinarily,
someone
sentenced
for
joyriding
would
have
expected
to
be
out
within
a
year
or
two
i
think.
jerry
mempa
has
been
there
since
1959.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
generally
up
to
the
board.
i
doubt
it.
i
doubt
if
they
gave
him
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
and
he
is
still
there.
it
was
eight
years
ago.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
mr.
way
could
answer
that
better
than
i
since
he
is
with
the
attorney
general's
office.
i
think
on
a
ten-year
charge,
it
would
be
after
a
year
or
two
but
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
our
parole
procedures.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
i
believe
he
was
paroled
once.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
since
then
yes,
and
violated
the
terms.
i'm
not
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
he
was
not
your
honor.
they
proceeded
to
revoke
instead.
in
1965,
he
filed
the
pro
se
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
the
washington
state
supreme
court,
arguing
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
washington
state
constitution
and
that
he
had
not
have
a
lawyer.
to
the
importance
of
the
matter,
our
state
supreme
court
held
an
en
banc
hearing
on
the
issue.
in
other
words,
all
nine
of
our
judges
heard
the
case
instead
of
just
the
department.
but
mr.
mempa
was
not
invited
to
argue
and
no
one
was
appointed
to
represent
him.
the
only
one
who
argued
the
case
was
a
representative
from
the
state
attorney
general's
office.
i
am
told
that
he
may
have
presented
a
summary
of
the
points
in
mr.
mempa's
behalf.
a
comprehensive
opinion
was
delivered
by
the
state
supreme
court
which
divided
six
to
three
on
this
issue.
they
denied
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
our
court
faced
the
issue
very
squarely
and
said
the
precise
issue
was
whether
or
not
he
was
entitled
to
counsel
under
the
federal
or
state
constitution
is
in
this
hearing.
the
court
characterized
the
original
grant
of
probation
as
a
privilege
or
grace
and
exercise
of
the
chance
that
was
grace.
the
court
said
that
since
there
were
no
constitutional
rights
to
the
acquisition
of
probation
of
any
status,
there
were
likewise
no
constitutional
rights
surrounding
its
revocation.
the
court
characterized
this
whole
proceeding
as
essentially
quasi
administrative
in
nature,
saying
that
it
was
analogous
to
the
--
to
other
phases
of
penal
administration
within
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
he
had
been
--
i've
met
him
and
he
follows
decisions
of
this
court
very
closely
after
he
read
the
gideon
case,
he
started
thinking
about
this
and
wrote
his
own
petition
and
sent
it
in.
the
washington
supreme
court
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
after
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
now
that's
now
gone
by
the
boards.
after
this
court's
kent
decision,
our
court
begins
to
change
its
procedures
in
its
juvenile
area.
and
particularly
after
the
gault
decision
handed
down
by
this
court,
our
state
completely
revamped
its
procedures.
in
any
event,
during
--
mempa
was
17
when
this
arrest
occurred.
the
order
waiving
juvenile
jurisdiction
and
transferring
him
to
adult
authority
was
entered
while
he
was
an
escapee
from
juvenile
court
custody.
he
was
given
no
hearing
of
any
sort.
under
washington
state
law
now,
this
entitled
him
to
a
new
hearing
on
the
original
waiver
of
jurisdiction.
the
hearing
was
held
some
months
ago
in
spokane
superior
court
and
the
judge
concluded
that
the
original
waiver
of
jurisdiction
was
proper.
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that
has
been
washed
out.
that
was
pending
at
the
time
we
filed
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
that
was
when
he
was
17
your
honor,
when
he
was
first
arrested
in
joyriding,
they
had
him
and
he
ran
down
the
hall
and
got
away
and
he
gave
himself
up
a
few
days
later
with
his
stepfather.
since
then,
he
spent
time
in
monroe
which
is
our
reformatory
and
then
he
was
transferred
to
walla
walla
which
is
our
penitentiary
and
i
think
it
has
a
better
law
library
than
monroe.
our
state
supreme
court
concluded
its
opinion
in
this
case
by
stating
and
i
quote,
no
appeal
and
no
petition
for
habeas
corpus
will
be
successful
in
this
court
where
the
issue
is
whether
the
probationer
was
accorded
his
constitutional
due
process
rights
at
the
hearing.
the
answer
is
simple.
he
has
none.
i'd
now
like
to
turn
to
the
facts
in
number
22,
the
walkling
case.
they're
very
similar
and
i'll
try
to
go
through
them
a
little
faster.
in
1962,
mr.
walkling
was
arrested
and
charged
with
the
crime
of
burglary.
he
had
an
attorney
and
i
don't
know
if
he
was
appointed
or
not.
he
pleaded
guilty
and
the
court
placed
him
on
probation
for
three
years,
conditioned
upon
serving
90
days
in
jail.
in
1964,
the
charges
were
made
that
he
had
been
involved
in
several
counts
of
forgery.
he
was
arrested
and
brought
in
the
court
on
a
motion
to
revoke
probation.
on
the
day
he
appeared
which
was
in
may,
he
informed
the
court
that
he
needed
continuance
to
secure
an
attorney
and
incorporate
the
matter
over
one
week.
a
week
later,
mr.
walkling
was
in
court
at
9
o'clock
and
said,
your
honor,
i
think
an
olympia
lawyer
named
smith
troy
is
supposed
to
represent
me.
this
court
held
the
matter
in
advance
for
15
minutes
when
no
one
had
appeared
by
9:15,
the
court
proceeded.
mr.
walkling
did
not
have
counsel.
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
precisely
whether
or
not
he
requested
the
appointment
of
counsel
or
said
anything
further.
he
alleges
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
that
he
repeatedly
requested
counsel.
unfortunately,
either
reporters'
notes
were
not
made
of
that
hearing
or
if
made,
the
reporter
is
dead
and
no
one
can
find
the
notes.
so
we
have
no
concrete
proof
that
he
did
or
did
not
request
a
lawyer.
however,
in
the
record
is
an
affidavit
from
harold
cook
who
was
then
the
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
and
who
appeared
against
mr.
walkling.
mr.
cook
is
now
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
thurston
county.
in
his
affidavit,
mr.
cook
states
that
he
cannot
remember
what
exactly
happened
at
this
precise
hearing.
but
he
said,
judge
clifford
for
whom
this
matter
came
on
for
hearing
had
a
practice
on
all
probation
revocation
hearings
of
allowing
the
appearance
of
retained
counsel
but
he
took
the
position
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
appointed
counsel
for
indigence.
he
did
not
have
a
practice
of
advising
of
a
right
to
counsel
if
a
request
was
made
for
appointed
counsel,
his
practice
was
to
turn
it
down
but
he
always
accommodated
retained
counsel.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor.
no.
nothing
about
judge
clifford.
i
can
state
from
my
own
personal
knowledge
somewhat
what
judges
in
the
state
of
washington,
based
on
kings
county.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
in
a
limited
degree
it
is.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
there's
a
hearsay
problem
which
of
course
most
lawyers
will
object
to
it
and
try
to
do
something
about
and
i
think
the
lawyers
--
i
think
many
times,
it's
like
so
many
criminal
case
demands
cut,
red
handed
and
obviously
did
it
and
the
lawyer
spends
more
of
his
time
trying
to
negotiate
something,
trying
to
argue
that
notwithstanding
this
violation
the
man's
probation
should
not
be
revoked.
in
washington,
probation
can
be
revoked
for
very
minor
things.
for
example,
the
probationer's
neighbor
might
have
called
the
probation
officer
and
said,
i
saw
him
drinking
beer
in
the
tavern
last
friday
night.
this
maybe
a
violation
or
he's
been
out
after
curfew
or
he
left
the
county.
there
are
a
great
number
of
little
things
which
can
justify
revocation.
many
times,
the
lawyer
will
try
to
attack
those
and
try
to
argue
that
notwithstanding
this
the
man
should
be
left
on
probation.
most
lawyers
that
i
know
of
would
definitely
raise
the
hearsay
issue.
demand
a
right
of
confrontation
of
the
witnesses.
now
our
court
is
held
that
there
is
no
right
of
confrontation
in
these
hearings.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
right
of
confrontation?
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
think
there
should
be
a
right
of
confrontation
in
one
of
these
hearings.
my
basic
position
today
is
that
the
most
indispensable
element
in
one
of
these
hearings
is
the
right
of
counsel.
i
don't
think
from
those
flows
other
rights
but
i
think
that
is
the
one
thing
without
which
the
man
cannot
have
a
fair
hearing.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
i
am
your
honor
and
the
fourteenth.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
he
was
given
--
his
probation
was
revoked
and
he
was
sentenced
to
15
years
on
these
14
different
counts
of
forgery.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
that
is.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
initially,
he
was
placed
on
probation
for
three
years
which
means
in
the
state
of
washington
that
if
he
had
been
a
law
abiding
citizen
for
three
years,
he
could
have
been
made
a
motion
to
wipe
out
his
record
and
to
do
away
with
this
entire
offense
but
he
was
brought
in
on
this
forgery.
in
this
case
too,
the
probation
officer
was
the
only
one
who
testified.
he
testified
about
the
14
counts
that
were
alleged
against
this
man.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
the
walkling
case,
your
honor?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
mempa
--
mempa
was
only
sentenced
to
10
years.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
a
funny
thing
happened
in
the
mempa
case
which
i
will
be
happy
to
clarify
for
the
court.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
judge
said,
very
well,
it
is
further
judgment
of
the
court
that
you
will
be
confined
for
a
maximum
period
of
10
years.
and
now
i'm
going
to
suspend
every
bit
of
that
except
30
days.
that
sounds
like
a
suspended
sentence
instead
of
a
deferred
sentence.
so
the
prosecutor
then
said
because
your
honor,
actually,
what
you're
doing
is
placing
the
defendant
on
probation
and
the
judge
said,
yes,
that
is
the
effect
of
it
except
that
he
serves
15
days
and
i
would
make
it
for
two
years.
and
the
judge
says,
this
is
a
probationary
order
mr.
roe
with
the
exception
of
his
serving
30
days.
now,
the
actual
written
order
which
was
entered
in
the
mempa
case
was
an
order
of
probation
not
an
order
of
suspended
sentence.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
walkling,
that's
right.
well,
the
judge
in
mempa
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
nothing
of
significance
your
honor.
the
judge
in
the
mempa
case
--
these
were
different
judges,
had
the
suspended
sentence
and
deferred
sentence
somewhat
mixed
up
and
by
saying,
first,
i'm
going
to
sentence
you
but
i'm
going
to
suspend
it.
whereas
in
walkling,
the
judge
used
the
correct
terminology
without
even
referring
to
any
length
of
time
and
he
said,
i'm
going
to
defer
sentence
in
you
but
i
will
put
you
in
jail
for
90
days.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
there
wouldn't
be
doubt,
your
honor.
the
sentence
had
not
been
entered.
the
judge
was
free
in
the
first
case
if
probation
violation
subsequently
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
i
would
think
the
man
would
reasonably
expect
that
he
would
get
ten
years
but
the
judge
wasn't
obligated.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
with
one
exception
now
by
and
large
these
sentences
which
are
entered
in
the
state
of
washington
are
set
by
statute.
the
judge
generally
gives
the
maximum
sentence
whatever
the
statute
says,
he
then
makes
the
recommendations
to
what
he
thinks
the
minimum
should
be
and
then
the
state
board
of
prison
terms
and
paroles
has
a
final
decision
as
to
how
much
this
man
actually
has
to
serve.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it's
hard
for
me
to
answer
you,
your
honor.
i
really
don't
know
enough
about
it.
i
know
that
in
criminal
cases
i've
handled,
we
always
try
very
hard
to
get
a
low
recommendation
from
the
judge.
we
think
it's
important
in
practice
but
--
and
how
much
attention
is
paid,
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
depends
on
the
variety
of
the
type
of
offense
and
how
thoroughly
into
the
man's
background
the
judge
investigated.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
a
parole
your
honor
or
probation?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
rule
is
as
follows,
the
order
deferring
sentence
and
placing
the
man
in
probation
is
not
appealable
unless,
number
one,
it
was
entered
after
a
trial
on
the
merits;
and
number
two,
the
man
receive
a
small
amount
of
time
in
jail
as
a
condition
of
probation.
and
then
in
that
case,
the
appeal
is
limited
to
trial
error.
but
the
basic
rule
is
that
this
order
of
deferred
sentence
is
not
appealable.
this
i'll
get
to
you
later
in
my
argument.
the
first
time
the
man
has
a
right
of
appeal
is
later
when
probations
revoked
and
sentences
entered.
that
is
the
final
judgment
in
the
criminal
case
in
the
first
time
he
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
then
it
is,
and
it
brings
in
to
play
all
original
trial
errors.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor
at
least
for
that.
i
think
that's
an
easier
question
in
probation
revocation
but
it
would
create
a
weird
situation
in
which
the
right
to
counsel
would
cease
when
the
order
of
probation
was
entered,
there
would
be
no
right
to
counsel
until
probation
was
revoked
and
then
the
man
would
be
given
a
lawyer
for
sentencing.
but
i
think
sentencing
is
easier.
i
think
that
more
squarely
fits
within
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment.
that's
quite
obviously
part
of
the
criminal
prosecution.
i
maintain
that
this
whole
thing
is
--
this
all
takes
place
prior
to
sentencing.
i
don't
think
the
language
used
by
the
court
is
very
significant.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
i
would
prefer
to
see
this
case
decided
in
due
process,
sixth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds
because
i
think
the
equal
protection
argument,
by
analogy
the
douglas
versus
california
would
mean
that
if
the
state
legislature
decided
to
deprive
the
affluent
of
retained
counsel,
the
equal
protection
i
know
wouldn't
help
us
if
they
didn't
provide
the
hearing
at
all
in
this
case.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well
your
honor,
i
have
never
heard
of
a
situation
in
the
state
in
which
retain
counsel
was
not
allowed.
we
do
not
have
a
rule
of
court
or
a
statute
which
clearly
says
there's
a
right
to
retain
counsel
in
one
of
these
hearings.
but
as
the
dissent
pointed
out
below,
as
i
think
my
opponent
would
even
admit,
the
general
practices
to
allow
retained
counsel.
i've
never
heard
of
one
being
ordered
out
of
the
room.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no
your
honor.
no,
that
rarely
happens
in
one
of
these
setups.
it's
much
easier
to
revoke
his
original
probation
and
then
sentence
him
on
that
original
charge
and
that's
what
happened
here.
he
was
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
and
that's
where
he
was
until
he
also
filed
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it's
much
faster,
your
honor.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor,
never
trialed
on
that.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
now,
when
petitioner
walkling
filed
his
habeas
corpus
petition,
it
also
came
on
for
argument
below.
there,
the
argument
was
directed
at
the
continued
validity
of
the
mempa
decision
which
we've
been
discussing.
no
opinion
was
rendered
by
our
state
supreme
court
in
walkling
merely
cited
mempa
and
denied
habeas
corpus.
these
cases
then
were
brought
to
this
court.
monday
of
this
week,
this
court
granted
a
motion
substituting
the
parole
board
as
the
respondent
in
the
walkling
case
because
he
has
since
then
parole,
he
was
paroled
by
the
supreme.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh
yes
your
honor.
i
can't
distinguish
them
at
all.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
i
can't.
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
at
this
point
to
what
is
involved
at
a
probation
revocation
here
in
the
states.
to
summarize
them
quickly,
the
man's
liberty
is
obviously
at
stake.
this
proceeding
is
convened
to
pass
upon
whether
or
not
he
should
go
to
jail
or
not.
his
reputation
is
at
stake.
is
he
going
to
now
lose
his
chance
to
clear
his
record
someday?
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
a
man
who
lives
up
to
the
terms
of
his
probation
can
move
to
have
his
record
cleared.
this
is
a
very
significant
right.
so
his
future
record
is
involved
in
this
hearing.
his
appellant
remedies
are
involved
and
most
significantly,
this
is
going
to
be
the
hearing
at
which
for
the
first
time,
he
is
sentenced
on
a
criminal
charge.
now,
in
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
you
carved
out
right
to
counsel
in
many
stages
with
the
proceeding
against
an
accused.
the
names
of
some
of
the
cases
of
course
would
be
gideon,
douglas,
escobedo,
miranda,
kent
and
gault.
but
a
small
area
still
remains
in
which
there
is
no
right
to
counsel
rules.
professor
catey
(ph)
has
called
this
the
penal
correctional
gap
that
includes
such
things
as
probation,
suspended
sentences
and
parole.
this
case,
we
think
clearly
presents
an
issue
in
one
small
phase
of
this
gap.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
your
honor.
they
could
not
have
appealed
at
that
point.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
back
at
the
time,
because
there
have
been
no
contested
trial--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
you
have
to
have
a
trial
on
the
merits,
a
conviction
and
time
in
jail
and
then
you
can
appeal.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
--
and
our
court
has
been
very
consistent
in
that
out
there.
they
will
not
entertain
those
appeals.
now,
the
interesting
thing
in
the
mempa
case
is
this.
he'd
pleaded
guilty
to
the
crime
of
joyriding
and
of
course
there
would
not
be
much
that
he
could
appeal
but
he
did
have
an
appealable
ground
as
subsequently
appeared.
of
course,
i
don't
think
many
lawyers
would
have
been
smart
enough
to
think
of
it
at
the
time
but
since
he
was
a
juvenile
and
his
exclusive
--
and
since
the
juvenile
court
had
waived
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
him
without
a
hearing,
he
had
a
constitutional
argument
which
could
have
been
raised
by
appeal.
now,
a
smart
lawyer
might
have
thought
of
that.
this
might
have
come
up
years
before
this
court's
decision
in
kent
and
gault.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
he
did
and
the
lawyer
wasn't
smart
to
think
but
i'm
just
pointing
this
out
to
say
that
there
was
an
appealable
ground
but
of
course
it
wasn't
appealable.
he
got
probation.
he
could
not
have
appealed
and
raised
that
point.
he
even
had
a
--
the
only
--
even
if
he'd
wanted.
his
lawyer
would
have
had
to
say,
we
turn
down
probation,
we
don't
want
it.
we
want
you
to
enter
judgment
and
sentence
and
then
we
can
appeal
on
this
point.
that's
the
only
way
he
could
have
taken
the
question
up.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no.
no,
that's
very
common,
your
honor.
the
courts
usually
reserved
probation
for
people
who
have
no
record,
first
offenders.
but
it's
common
to
give
them
some
small
period
of
time
in
jail
to
give
them
some
punishment
on
this
because
typically,
the
man
may
have
been
bailed
right
after
he
was
originally
arrested.
he's
only
spent
one
or
two
days
in
jail
and
the
court
thinks,
well,
i
want
to
give
this
man
a
chance
to
see
if
we
can
rehabilitate
him
but
i'll
give
him
some
short
period
in
the
county
jail
to
let
him
see
how
serious
this
is.
some
criminologists
argue
that
the
first
30
days
a
man
ever
served
are
the
toughest.
those
are
the
30
that
he
really
feels.
now,
i'm
sure
it's
true.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
now,
the
washington
court
has
said
that
this
hearing
is
quasi
administrative,
that
it's
analogous
to
penal
administration.
the
court
seems
to
be
saying
that
this
is
not
a
criminal
hearing
and
therefore
these
constitutional
rights
don't
come
into
play.
this
is
an
essence
on
what
my
opponent
argues.
we
submit
that
the
labels
applied
to
this
hearing
by
the
lower
court
are
not
sufficient
to
avoid
the
thrust
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
concepts
and
protections
that
which
should
give.
i
think
this
was
decided
by
this
court
in
kent
and
gault
with
labels
and
characterizations
are
not
enough
to
get
around
the
due
process
considerations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
he
would
have
to
be
under
this
court's
decisions.
i
do
not
as
a
practical
matter
whether
or
not
this
has
come
up
because
i
think
it's
fairly
unusual
for
a
man
to
appeal
after
probation
is
revoked.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
he
has
the
right
to
appeal.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
doubt
if
our
courts
go
through
the
motions
of
advising
him
of
his
right.
i
don't
really
know.
i'm
not
that
familiar
so
i
can't
tell
you
what
the
practice
is.
now,
our
court
has
also
laid
great
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
the
original
granting
of
probation
as
an
exercise
of
the
chance
is
grace.
the
court
has
said
there
are
no
constitutional
rights
to
the
acquisition
of
probationary
status,
there
are
likewise,
no
rights
surrounding
its
revocation.
they
rely
on
this
old
concept
of
the
chancellors'
grace,
right
of
privilege
concept.
this
is
based
on
i
think
the
old
the
case
of
esco
versus
(inaudible)
it's
indicted
by
mr.
justice
cardozo.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
really
cannot
help
you
on
that
precise
point.
my
understanding
of
the
practice
in
other
states
is
that
virtually
all
the
states
have
a
probation
system.
many
do
not
make
the
split
we
do
between
deferred
sentences
and
suspended
sentences
and
many
of
them,
and
i
think
in
the
federal
system,
judgment
has
entered,
the
sentence
is
entered
but
it's
suspended.
this
is
called
probation
in
that
system.
probation
can
apply
to
both
of
these
situations.
the
accurate
terminology
would
be
one
is
a
deferred
sentence
and
one
is
a
suspended
sentence.
i
do
not
know
what
the
appeal
situation
is.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
our
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
gideon
applies
equally
to
this
procedure.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
it
would,
your
honor
regardless
of
the
appeal
point.
i
think
the
fundamental
thing
here
is
the
fact
that
a
man's
liberty
is
at
stake.
he
is
brought
into
a
court
and
there's
a
judge
on
the
bench,
there's
a
prosecutor
at
the
other
table,
the
testimony
is
taken
and
his
liberty
is
at
stake.
his
right
to
a
clear
record
is
at
stake.
these
are
fundamental
rights.
this
is
obviously
a
very
critical
stage.
now
regardless
of
appeal
questions
whether
it
could
have
appealed
last
year
or
now,
regardless
of
what
the
court
calls
it,
i
think
quite
clearly,
he's
entitled
to
do
process
applied
in
this
hearing.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
the
state
of
washington.
that's
right,
which
makes
it,
i
think
easier
to
argue
that
this
is
part
of
the
sixth
amendment
protection
but
if
in
states
where
this
is
not
the
terminal
stage,
if
this
is
a
state
where
the
writer
--
where
the
sentence
had
already
been
entered
then
i
think
we
can
rely
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth.
regardless
of
whether
we
call
this
criminal,
civil
or
what
have
you
if
liberty
is
at
stake,
and
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
due
process.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
this
case
doesn't
present
that.
now
our
--
we
only
present
counsel
issues
here.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
don't
think
--
i
see
where
you're
leading
but
i
--
in
the
normal
sentencing
procedure
from
divorce
probation
concepts,
testimony
is
not
taken
in
an
open
court.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
judge
looks
elsewhere.
i
realize
that
the
case
law
is
that
there's
no
right
of
confrontation
of
those
sources
of
information
which
the
judge
relies
on.
i
think
that
when
a
person
is
brought
in
a
court
and
placed
on
the
stand
when
testimony
is
taken,
when
there
are
issues
of
fact
and
a
new
fact
finding
process
is
taking
place
then
i
think
there's
a
right
of
confrontation.
i'm
going
beyond
my
case.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
can't
--
i
think
there
should
be
but
i'm
not
prepared
today
to
argue
what
the
constitution
requires
but
i
prefer
to
stay
within
the
confines
of
right
to
counsel
issue
because
i
think
that's
much
easier.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
absolutely,
your
honor.
this
is
a
hearing
in
the
court
with
witnesses.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
a
prosecutor.
this
is
a
very
vital
and
critical
proceeding
against
this
man
regardless
of
what
we
got.
now,
this
court
is
held
in
the
area
of
economic
privileges
if
they
cannot
arbitrarily
be
withdrawn
even
though
the
granting
of
a
certain
federal
benefits
maybe
a
privilege
but
that
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
you
can
just
arbitrarily
pull
them
back.
i
think
the
dicta
in
esco
versus
(inaudible)
is
kind
of
been
eroded
for
the
passage
of
time
in
subsequent
cases
in
this
court.
in
gault
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh
yes
your
honor,
very
definitely.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
there
are
two
other
cases
that
bear
on
this.
one
is
townsend
versus
burke
in
which
this
court
had
before
it
the
issue
of
the
right
to
counsel
at
sentencing.
in
that
case
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
townsend
versus
burke.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
would
you
like
to
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
issue
there
was
right
to
counsel
at
sentencing.
this
is
a
pre-gideon
case.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i
regard
them
as
in
way
separable
issues
as
far
as
the
probation
revocation
hearing
is
concerned
and
testimony
is
taken
and
this
is
very
much
like
a
trial,
issues
of
facts
they've
presented.
i
think
there's
a
need
for
counsel
there
under
gideon,
under
basic
due
process
concepts
that
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
i'm
presenting
both.
under
sentencing,
i
rely,
i
can
first
use
the
other
arguments
but
i
think
there
are
separate
arguments
available
on
sentencing,
namely
the
townsend
versus
burke,
the
moore
case
and
gideon.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
if
sentencing
presents
a
narrower
way
to
decide
this
case
without
dealing
with
the
probation
hearing,
this
wouldn't
answer
very
many
questions
because
it
would
be
easy
to
restructure
the
system.
if
this
court
dealt
only
with
the
sentencing
issue
citing
say
townsend
and
gideon,
i
don't
think
that
the
case
would
have
much
of
an
impact
upon
the
federal
practice
where
sentences
entered
and
then
suspended.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
on
parole
hearings,
we
have
a
statute
which
provides
that
you
have
a
right
to
counsel
at
parole
hearings.
this
is
construed
i
believe
to
mean
only
retain
counsel.
so
we
have
the
anomaly
situation
in
washington
where
we
know
there's
a
right
to
retain
counsel
at
a
parole
hearing
but
we
have
nothing
expressly
giving
us
the
right
to
retain
counsel
at
probation
hearings.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
they
don't
appoint
counsel,
that's
quite
right
in
parole
hearings.
i
don't
know
of
any
jurisdiction
that
does
that.
i
remember
that
several
years
ago,
there
were
some
cases
in
the
dc
circuit.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i'm
not
--
that's
on
parole
or
probation.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
my
contention
today
is
limited
to
probation,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
would
be
my
contention.
now
people
--
i
like
to
deal
with
the
gault
case
for
a
minute
and
i
think
the
gault
case
comes
very
close
to
what
we're
dealing
with
here
today.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
there's
a
right
to
counsel
in
a
proceeding.
it
is
determined
that
the
child
is
delinquent
and
is
to
be
subjected
to
the
lost
of
his
liberty.
this
is
very
similar
to
what
we
have
here.
characterization
questions
were
branched
aside
and
called
as
to
whether
it's
criminal
or
civil,
what
have
you.
i
think
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
this
fact
pattern.
now,
the
argument
has
been
advanced
by
commentators
and
that
an
attorney
is
not
necessary
in
one
of
these
hearings,
that
the
man
has
had
plenty
of
breaks
already.
the
probation
officers
lean
over
backwards
to
be
fair
as
the
state
of
florida
has
said
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
against
me,
everybody
knows
that
probation
officers
are
fair
and
not
arbitrary.
i
think
there's
quite
a
deal
that
attorneys
can
do.
i'd
like
to
point
out
some
of
the
things.
if
there
are
issues
of
fact
and
there
are
frequently
are,
only
an
attorney
can
effectively
marshal
the
evidence,
bring
it
together
and
put
on
a
case,
put
on
a
defense.
the
probationer
generally
is
in
jail
being
held,
awaiting
his
hearing.
the
attorney
can
build
his
defense.
he
can
cross-examine
the
probation
officer
or
the
other
witnesses
who
are
called
against
him.
he
can
object
to
improper
procedure.
he
can
raise
a
hearsay
objection
although
he
may
not
get
ready
for
it.
questions
of
law
can
be
involved.
first
of
all,
are
there
sufficient
grounds
to
revoke
probation?
in
the
state
of
washington,
probation
can
only
be
revoked
for
cause.
our
statute
says
that
if
the
man
violates
the
terms
of
his
probation,
that
means
the
rules
lay
down
by
the
probation
board
having
to
do
with
hours
he
keeps,
type
of
life
he
lives;
or
secondly,
if
he
is
abandoned
to
improper
associates,
he
can
have
his
probation
revoked,
or
if
he
is
engaging
in
criminal
practices,
he
can
end
up
revoked;
lastly,
if
he
is
living
a
vicious
life.
now
i'm
not
raising
any
vaugeness
problems
today
but
i
don't
know
what
that
one
means.
i
think
this
raises
a
need
for
lawyer
though.
i
think
a
lawyer
would
want
to
raise
at
the
hearing
what
if
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
our
statute
directs
that
on
the
revocation,
he
is
to
brought
back
before
the
judge.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
i've
not
your
honor.
i
never
have.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
there
are
two
other
conditions
to
have.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
it
would
your
honor.
you
see
that
the
review
on
trial
error
is
limited
to
the
appeal
which
is
taken
when
probation
is
originally
granted
and
not
wanting
to
revoke.
once
probation
is
revoked
and
sentences
entered
then
an
appeal
can
be
taken
covering
the
original
trial,
the
revocation
and
probation
and
the
sentence.
everything
then
would
go
up.
now,
our
case
law
provides
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
over
turn
a
trial
court's
decision
revoking
probation.
this
is
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
there
are
no
burden
approved
rules
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
court
simply
says
that
if
the
courts
convinced
the
man
violate
with
the
terms
of
probation.
so
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
in
which
our
court
is
overturned
to
trial
court
finding.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh
yes
your
honor,
that's
right.
now,
going
back
to
what
the
lawyer
could
do
at
this
revocation
hearing,
ignoring
for
a
moment
issues
of
fact
which
i
have
discussed,
he
would
want
to
determine
and
argued
to
the
court
first
of
all
that
cause
have
not
been
made
out
for
revocation
and
probation.
but
assume
the
judge
disagreed
and
felt
that
there
is
a
requisite
cause
to
revoke
then
the
attorney
can
present
mitigating
circumstances
in
an
attempt
to
persuade
the
court
to
leave
the
man
on
probation
and
notwithstanding
the
violation.
this
would
be
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge
or
if
that's
resolved
against
the
attorney,
he
can
then
deal
with
the
sentencing
issue
and
try
to
have
matters
and
mitigation
of
sentence
considered
which
would
go
to
a
low
recommendation
from
the
judge.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
because
there
are
cases
which
say
that
the
language
of
criminal
prosecution
under
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
be
construed
technically
so
i
can
conceive
of
the
argument
being
made
that
if
sentencing
had
already
occurred
and
then
the
man
was
placed
on
probation.
the
criminal
prosecution
might
have
come
to
an
end
and
therefore
those
concepts
don't
apply.
so
i
think
there
are
two
grounds
but
i
think
under
gault
and
cases
like
that.
this
is
a
critical
stage
at
which
due
process
rights
to
counsel
apply.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
we
depend
on
the
way
that
this
--
an
opinion
in
this
case
was
phrased
if
the
court
ruled
in
this
case
solely
on
the
sentencing
ground.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
re
gault
sort
of
concepts.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
then
it
might
apply
to
parole
arguably
because
there
too
with
the
man's
liberty
is
at
stake.
the
one
difference
though
is
that
parole
doesn't
occur
in
court.
this
does
--
this
is
the
court,
there's
a
judge
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
they
are
done
administrative.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
a
matter
which
is
vested
in
the
discretion
either
of
the
judge
or
in
the
case
of
parole
and
the
parole
board.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
factors
that
we
consider.
i
accept
the
argument
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
the
acquisition
of
the
status.
i
think
the
rights
come
into
play
once
this
conditional
liberty
is
given
to
the
man.
now,
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
the
national
legal
aid
and
defender
association,
points
out
that
11
states
already
appoint
counsel
in
these
hearings.
and
these
states
make
up
roughly
one-fourth
of
the
population.
they've
taken
a
survey
and
they
found
that
certain
counties
in
roughly
24
other
states
also
appoint
counsel.
some
counties
do
and
don't.
they
have
no
rigid
rule
in
their
state.
this
raises
it
to
roughly
one-half
of
the
population
in
this
country.
one-half
of
the
courts
already
appoint
counsel,
the
others
don't.
only
three
states
within
this
country
say
that
there's
no
right
to
a
hearing
at
all
on
probation
revocation.
three
states
say
that
the
probation
officer
can
arrest
the
man
and
throw
him
in
jail
and
that
seem
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
they're
in
this
brief.
i'll
be
happy
to
read
them
for
you.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
don't
remember
them.
there
are
so
many
different
statistics
on
states
and
they
line
up
in
different
ways.
the
trend
of
expert
opinion
in
writing
in
the
field
that
supports
the
right
to
counsel
just
to
point
out
three
things,
the
president's
commission
on
crime
and
administration
of
justice
recommended
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
probation
revocation
hearings.
american
bar
association
committees
which
have
studied
this
recommend
the
same
thing
in
ali
model
penal
code
it's
recommended
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
probation
revocation
hearings.
in
so
far
as
burdens
on
the
system
are
concerned,
i'd
like
to
make
--
to
give
the
court
the
benefit
of
some
of
the
information
in
this
brief.
in
1965
in
the
state
system,
144,000
people
were
placed
on
probation.
the
average
probation
case
load
on
1965,
in
other
words,
the
total
average
daily
number
of
people
on
probation
during
the
year
was
230,000.
the
average
number
of
revocations
during
that
year
totaled
roughly
one
third
of
that.
so
we're
talking
similar
between
30,000
to
40,000
probation
revocations
a
year.
i
think
this
can
be
handled
very
easily
within
our
existing
system
for
appointing
counsel
as
result
of
this
court's
gideon
decision,
every
state
now
has
either
a
defender
system
or
a
system
for
appointing
local
members
of
the
bar.
if
a
man
had
been
appointed
to
represent
this
fellow
on
his
original
charge,
it
makes
sense
to
appoint
that
same
lawyer
on
the
probation
revocation.
he
argued
for
probation
and
now
if
it's
to
be
revoked,
he
should
come
back
and
represent
this
man.
he
has
a
file
on
the
case,
he
knows
him.
i
think
these
ideas
of
appointing
lawyers
for
this
were
just
working
very
easily
within
our
existing
system.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
this
case
doesn't
present
those.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
that
the
court
can
treat
probation
revocation
hearings
and
parole
revocation
hearings
as
a
special
sort
of
hearing.
we
have
to
look
at
the
fact
that
this
man
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
involving
less
technical
concepts
in
the
trial.
the
man
had
his
trial
or
at
least
he
has
a
right
to
it.
he
either
pleaded
guilty
or
he
was
convicted.
he
has
been
given
a
certain
conditional
liberty
by
the
state.
i
don't
think
he
needs
a
brand
new
trial
with
all
of
the
technical
and
full
blown
rights
when
they
want
to
revoke
this.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
--
well,
as
i
rank
them,
i
think
the
right
of
counsel
is
number
one,
the
most
important.
i
think
if
there
is
an
issue
of
fact,
he
should
have
confrontation.
i
think
i
would
tend
to
treat
it
more
like
a
civil
case
perhaps
with
no
right
to
a
jury
with
the
burden
of
proof
rule
being
generally
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
if
the
judge
believes
if
there
has
been
a
violation,
he
can
send
the
man
back
to
jail.
but
i
think
confrontation
is
essential.
it
might
be
a
malicious
neighbor
who
claims
this
man
as
keeping
bad
hours
or
associating
with
criminals
and
if
the
probation
officer
is
the
only
one
to
testify
the
hearings
of
course
and
nothing
can
be
accomplished.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
he
can,
your
honor
and
it's
commonly
done.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
was
involved
in
a
case
in
reno
in
which
the
judge
conditioned
probation
on
not
seeing
a
particular
woman
for
a
year
or
over
a
period,
i
think
it
was.
he
also
required
the
defendant
to
leave
the
state.
commonly,
they
require
the
defendant
to
make
restitution
to
the
victim.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor,
they
do.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
i
would
like
to
deal
for
a
moment
with
equal
protection.
also
i
pointed
out
we
have
no
statutory
judicial
requirement
of
appointed
counsel
in
the
state
with
the
factor
--
but
the
practice
is,
that
these
men
are
given
hearings
to
the
court
retained
counsel
are
permitted
to
appear.
the
affluent
probationer
is
allowed
counsel
indigent
was
found
for
himself.
i
think
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
under
the
cases
such
as
douglas
and
griffin.
thank
you.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
this
is
it.
well,
the
petitioner
--
probationer
can
turn
this
down.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
no,
i
don't
believe
it
as
a
matter
of
law
with
all
--
the
parole
board
may
if
it
wishes
considered
as
at
a
later
day.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
they
would.
i
would
think
so
particularly
if
it
was
a
lengthy
period
like
one
year,
thirty
days
or
two
weeks
they
might
not.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
believe
it
could
your
honor,
yes.
because
judgment
and
sentence
would
have
been
entered
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--
and
execution
deferred.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
so
a
final
order
would
have
been
entered,
an
appealable
order
and
i
believe
an
appeal
could
be
taken
from
that.
now,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
this
court
if
it
upholds
the
right
to
counsel
in
this
case
is
then
leading
itself
into
finding
other
constitutional
rights
and
probation
revocation
hearings,
namely
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
the
right
of
consultation,
the
right
to
an
indictment.
i
don't
think
this
necessarily
follows.
we're
talking
about
deprivations
of
liberty
and
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
primarily.
the
man
has
been
either
tried
or
he's
pleaded
guilty.
he
has
had
his
essential
criminal
trial
with
all
of
its
historical
safeguards.
this
is
a
new
type
of
proceeding.
due
process
i
think
requires
something
less
in
this
sort
of
a
proceeding.
i
see
no
reason
why
you
would
have
to
be
indicted
over
a
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
and
further,
the
hearing
itself,
the
probation
revocation
hearing
itself,
i
do
not
make
strictly
under
sixth
amendment
grounds.
i'm
not
saying
it
is
a
criminal
--
its
part
of
the
criminal
process
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it's
part
of
a
criminal
prosecution
but
not
a
separate
one,
not
to
be
carved
out
by
itself.
he
was
indicted
originally
when
he
was
arrested.
he
was
either
indicted
or
proceeded
against
by
information.
he
had
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
he
either
availed
himself
or
he
pleaded
guilty
or
he
waived
it.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
part
your
honor,
yes
i
do.
well,
i
think
this
is
part
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
i
think
all
proceedings
dealing
with
a
man
by
the
state
in
which
his
liberty
is
at
stake,
his
ability
to
remain
on
the
street
or
be
behind
bars
is
part
of
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
this
is
something
that
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--
that's
a
collateral
thing.
i
don't
--
his
criminal
prosecution
is
over.
they
made
the
decision.
they
put
him
away
and
it's
a
closed
book.
he
now
raises
new
issues
collaterally
by
habeas
corpus
or
in
the
federal
system
under
2255.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
i
don't
think
anything
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
and
i
--
well,
i
--
there
are
a
lot
of
practical
difficulties
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--
this
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
i
would
put
it
this
way.
i
don't
think
he
should
get
a
lawyer
to
prepare
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
or
to
argue
before
the
judge
initially.
the
judges
i
know
received
this
in
a
mail
by
this
court
and
many
of
them
are
frivolous.
but
if
a
hearing
is
to
be
held
in
court,
i
would
submit
there
should
be
a
right
to
counsel.
i
don't
think
a
man
should
ever
have
to
come
in
to
a
court
of
law
without
a
lawyer.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
don't
think
hearings
take
place
on
the
bulk
of
the
habeas
corpus
petitions.
i
think
that
they're
--
my
understanding
is
that
many
of
them
are
regarded
as
frivolous
by
the
judge
when
he
receives
them
and
just
deny
without
hearing.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
haven't
looked
it
up.
i
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
figures
we
have
on
probation
is
that
in
the
year
1965
in
the
state
courts,
i
think
it
was
a
146,000
persons
were
placed
on
probation
and
the
average
daily
case
load
of
persons
actually
serving
on
probation
that
year
was
about
230,000.
revocation
proceedings
seem
to
run
about
a
third
of
the
average
case
load,
roughly
one
third
of
this
people
violate.
so
this
would
be
around
40
--
35
to
40,
45,000
people
per
year.
and
of
course,
i
assume
it
would
go
up
each
year,
gets
larger.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
this
is
something
i
would
assume
a
lawyer
would
ask
for.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
you
could.
and
i
found
no
authority
on
that
and
i'm
sure
there
is
no
mistake
but
i'm
quite
sure
he
could
because
his
lawyer
will
be
arguing
or
at
least
he
will
be
arguing
to
keep
this
down
and
hold
this
to
a
minimum.
the
judge
has
the
great
deal
of
discretion
in
this
area.
the
judge
could
say
i'm
not
going
to
revoke
but
here's
a
new
condition,
some
period
of
time
in
the
county
jail
up
to
a
year,
the
statute
only
authorizes
the
year
in
jail.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
the
case
will
be
remanded.
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
will
issue.
he
will
then
be
entitled
to
a
new
probation
revocation
hearing
and
a
counsel
would
be
assigned.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
almost.
we
would
hope
to
negotiate
with
a
(inaudible)
authorities
and
have
them
just
forget
about
it,
put
him
back
in
probation
whether
that
goes
through
a
hearing.
he
will
serve
eight
years
and
nothing
much
is
to
be
gained
by
it.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
would
--
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
inference
your
honor
--
it's
in
the
record
(voice
overlap).
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
well
in
fact
your
honor
is
walkling
demonstrates
very
well
the
probation
authority
is
usually
the
ones
who
initiate
the
violation
proceedings.
the
probation
officer
here
is
an
employee
of
the
state
board
of
prison
terms
and
paroles
and
he
is
the
one
who
testified
as
to
these
14
counts
of
forgery
and
14
counts
of
larceny.
so
he
obviously
believe
that
there
was
a
merit
to
them
and
that
the
man
should
be
revoked
so
i'm
quite
sure
this
would
play
a
factor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
i
do
your
honor.
its
rcw
9.95.220,
entitled
violation
of
probation,
arrest,
imprisonment
and
tells
when
he
can
be
revoked.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes.
they're
in
the
appendix
to
our
--
on
the
brief
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
--
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
because
he
has
already
had
those
protections
in
connection
with
the
original
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
quite
right
but
i
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
new
crime,
that's
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
i
don't
think
there's
any
issue
there.
i
can
think
of
no
situation
in
which
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
because
i
think
a
lawyer
in
this
setting
of
what
is
actually
going
on
is
more
fundamentally
essential
than
the
jury.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
this
is
not
--
technically,
a
new
criminal
proceeding
against
him.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
they're
trying
to
revoke
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well
i
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
i
have
not
tried
to
maintain
that
he
in
essence,
being
tried
for
new
crimes
in
this
probation
revocation
hearing.
many
times,
the
alleged
violation
is
not
a
new
crime.
it
might
be
the
fact
that
it
kept
late
hours.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
many
times
it
is.
it
may
be
a
new
trial.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
there
are
issues
of
fact
in
this
hearing.
that's
right.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
if
the
state
repealed
the
probation
law?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
i
think
there
might
be
a
chance
if
they
would
repeal
it
into
a
way
with
the
system
--
they'd
be
torn
obviously
because
on
the
one
hand,
they
hope
to
rehabilitate
people
but
on
the
other
hand,
they
can
only
do
it
within
the
framework
of
what's
feasible.
this
is
--
this
partially
affects
my
argument
and
my
feelings
about
a
jury
in
one
of
those
things.
i
don't
think
that's
feasible.
i
think
a
lawyer
is.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i
regard
the
right
to
counsel
your
honor
as
being
so
important
that
at
least
that's
number
one
that
a
person
can
decide
that
without
going
to
the
next
step
but
the
other
ones
get
harder.
you
can
have
a
fair
hearing
without
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
a
jury
trial
is
a
difficult
situation
in
this
setting
your
honor.
i
think
this
would
have
a
definite
impact
on
the
use
of
the
probation
system.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
because
it
would
require
in
essence
two
the
trials.
i
think
we
would
find
judges
using
them.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
don't
think
the
presence
of
assigned
counsel
would
change
that
many
hearings.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
many
of
them
have
written
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
it
should
be.
i
think
there
--
if
he
does
not
admit
the
violation
and
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
don't
think
they
should
if
he
wants
to
contest
the
issues
of
fact,
i
think
he
should
be
confronted
with
these
witnesses.
someone
has
accused
him
of
something.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
that
should
follow,
yes
if
there's
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
on
page
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
on
page
20,
we
have
the
order
of
probation
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
typically
when
the
court
enters
an
order
like
this,
the
lawyer
and
his
client
or
the
client
if
he
is
there,
walk
across
the
street
in
seattle
at
least
to
the
probation
office
and
arrange
an
interview
and
he
sits
down,
he's
given
a
list
of
do's
and
don'ts
and
he
has
a
--
he
meets
his
probation
officer
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--
and
work
out
their
ground
rules.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
they
have
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
we
can
--
i
could
be
--
i'd
be
happy
to
get
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
i
don't
know
if
they're
in
published
form
or
not
or
if
they're
merely
internal
regulations
for
uses
in
the
board.
i've
had
no
contact
with
these
regulations.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh
yes.
you're
definitely
correct.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
this
is
comperable
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i
actually
walked
the
client
over
that
office
one
time
and
as
i
recall
when
i
looked
at
the
list,
it
had
all
sorts
of
things
about
hours
that
he
had
to
keep,
places
to
live.
he
couldn't
leave
the
county
i
believe
without
getting
permission.
he
couldn't
own
a
car
without
getting
permission
from
the
board
that
sort
of
restrictions
were
placed
upon
him.
they
gave
him
a
little
--
some
kind
of
a
mimeograph
form
they
hand
out
to
these
people
and
they're
required
to
report
back
at
periodic
intervals.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
you
did
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
it
was
williams.
i
believe
your
honor
wrote
that
opinion
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--
and
the
holding
was
that
the
judge
could
rely
on
material
which
has
not
been
subjected
to
a
cross-examination
contradiction.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
holding
was
that
the
judge
could
rely
on
this
material
which
had
not
been
seen
by
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it
was
as
i
recall,
it
was
based
on
a
concept
that
since
the
conviction
had
already
been
entered
since
the
man
is
either
been
found
guilty
or
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
--
more
technical
due
process
rights
ceased
and
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
the
ones
that
apply
more
--
in
a
more
technical
sense
to
trial
is
what
i
mean.
the
--
i
read
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i
don't
consider
them
technical
either
your
honor
but
i
--
what
i'm
trying
to
say
was
that
some
of
them
were
deemed
to
apply
only
to
trial
up
to
the
point
of
conviction
that
now
since
the
man
had
been
convicted,
the
judge
could
rely
on
a
greater
variety
of
material
if
this
had
been
done
historically.
the
courts
have
tried
to
consider
all
the
material
they
could
get
their
hands
on
that
might
help
them
enter
an
informed
decision
in
connection
with
the
sentence.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
we
don't
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
on
right
to
counsel
issues?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
i
think
it
does
have
a
bearing
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
representing
the
petitioners
jerry
douglas
mempa
and
william
walkling
in
both
case
number
16
and
case
number
22.
we
filed
a
joint
brief
covering
both.
these
cases
present
a
virtually
identical
issue
to
this
court,
namely,
whether
or
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
confers
the
right
to
counsel
during
probation
revocation
proceedings
and
at
the
sentencing
which
follows.
the
washington
supreme
court
held
that
these
petitioners
did
not
have
a
right
to
counsel
when
they
were
held
into
a
hearing
which
was
presided
over
by
a
superior
court
judge
where
they
were
opposed
by
a
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
and
were
the
basic
issue
with
their
continued
eligibility
for
freedom.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse
those
decisions.
since
they
present
identical
issues
with
only
differences
in
facts,
we
ask
leave
of
the
court
to
consolidate
these
cases
for
argument.
my
opponent
mr.
way
joins
in
this
request.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
would
like
to
add
half
an
hour
for
each
case,
giving
an
hour
for
me
and
then
give
mr.
way
an
hour
on
this
too.
turning
to
the
facts
first
in
number
16,
mempa
versus
rhay,
when
jerry
douglas
mempa
was
17,
he
was
arrested
in
charge
with
the
crime
of
burglary.
an
attorney
was
appointed
to
represent
him
and
he
entered
the
charge
--
excuse
me.
this
was
joyriding.
it
was
a
burglary
charge
in
walkling.
he
was
charged
with
joyriding,
which
in
the
state
of
washington
essentially
is
stealing
a
car.
people
in
this
age
bracket
frequently
are
involved
in
this
offense.
an
attorney
was
appointed
and
the
matter
came
on
for
trial
and
he
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
mempa
was
sentenced
to
30
days
in
the
county
jail
as
a
condition
for
a
deferred
sentence
on
the
charge
of
joyriding
and
such
was
not
entered.
the
order
which
was
entered
by
the
superior
court
judge
is
what
we
call
in
washington,
an
order
of
deferred
sentence.
it's
also
called
probation
in
state
of
washington.
he
was
placed
under
the
supervision
of
the
washington
state
board
of
prison
terms
and
paroles
and
this
is
prior
to
obey
their
rules.
four
months
later,
jerry
mempa
was
arrested
and
brought
back
before
the
court
on
the
prosecutor's
motion
to
revoke
the
probation
which
had
been
granted
earlier.
he
was
still
17
years
of
age
and
he
was
accompanied
to
the
hearing
only
by
his
stepfather.
he
was
not
asked
if
he
wanted
an
attorney.
he
was
not
asked
to
have
an
attorney
and
nothing
was
said
about
the
attorney
who
had
represented
him
four
months
earlier.
the
prosecutor
read
the
motion
to
revoke
probation
in
the
matter
--
then
got
underway.
the
court
asked
jerry
mempa
if
he
had
been
involved
in
this
alleged
new
violation
of
probation
which
in
this
case
was
burglary.
he
answered
in
the
affirmative.
at
that
point,
the
probation
officer
took
the
stand
and
testified
as
to
the
facts
concerning
this
alleged
burglary
that
jerry
mempa
was
involved
in.
the
judge
asked
the
probation
officer
if
it
was
not
true
that
mempa
had
originally
denied
this
charge
when
he
was
arrested
but
subsequently
admitted
it.
the
probation
officer
said
yes.
at
that
point,
the
judge
announces
that
he
was
revoking
probation.
he
signed
the
order
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
he
was
not
your
honor.
this
is
a
common
practice
in
washington
hearing.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
practice
in
our
state
and
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
prosecutor,
excuse
me.
the
probation
officer
testifies
to
the
facts.
it's
all
hearsay.
he
may
have
interviewed
the
witnesses
who
were
eyewitnesses.
he
may
have
interviewed
the
policemen
who
were
familiar
with
the
case.
he
may
have
heard
taken
a
statement
from
the
accused.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
this
is
the
way
it's
commonly
done
in
our
state.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
eyewitnesses
are
rarely
brought
in.
there's
rarely
a
chance
to
confront
them.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
all
we
have
on
the
record
is
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
filed
a
motion
to
revoke.
they
way
it
usually
works
if
the
man
is
arrested
or
a
complaint
is
made
by
the
probation
officer.
if
it's
a
new
crime,
it
would
originate
with
the
police.
if
it's
someone
who
calls
a
probation
officer,
he
would
initiate
it
by
calling
the
prosecutor
and
asking
that
this
proceeding
be
convened.
at
that
point,
the
men
are
generally
arrested
and
the
proceeding
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
the
prosecutor
represents
the
state
in
one
of
these
hearings.
jerry
mempa
was
not
given
a
chance
to
cross-examine
the
probation
officer.
he
was
not
asked
to
make
a
statement
in
his
own
behalf.
an
order
was
simply
entered
revoking
the
probation
and
sentencing
him
to
a
term
of
ten
years
in
the
state
penitentiary
on
that
original
charge
of
joyriding.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
it
is,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
the
state
of
washington
and
this
is
generally
up
to
the
state
board
of
prison
terms
and
paroles.
ordinarily,
someone
sentenced
for
joyriding
would
have
expected
to
be
out
within
a
year
or
two
i
think.
jerry
mempa
has
been
there
since
1959.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
generally
up
to
the
board.
i
doubt
it.
i
doubt
if
they
gave
him
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
and
he
is
still
there.
it
was
eight
years
ago.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
mr.
way
could
answer
that
better
than
i
since
he
is
with
the
attorney
general's
office.
i
think
on
a
ten-year
charge,
it
would
be
after
a
year
or
two
but
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
our
parole
procedures.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
i
believe
he
was
paroled
once.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
since
then
yes,
and
violated
the
terms.
i'm
not
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
he
was
not
your
honor.
they
proceeded
to
revoke
instead.
in
1965,
he
filed
the
pro
se
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
the
washington
state
supreme
court,
arguing
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
washington
state
constitution
and
that
he
had
not
have
a
lawyer.
to
the
importance
of
the
matter,
our
state
supreme
court
held
an
en
banc
hearing
on
the
issue.
in
other
words,
all
nine
of
our
judges
heard
the
case
instead
of
just
the
department.
but
mr.
mempa
was
not
invited
to
argue
and
no
one
was
appointed
to
represent
him.
the
only
one
who
argued
the
case
was
a
representative
from
the
state
attorney
general's
office.
i
am
told
that
he
may
have
presented
a
summary
of
the
points
in
mr.
mempa's
behalf.
a
comprehensive
opinion
was
delivered
by
the
state
supreme
court
which
divided
six
to
three
on
this
issue.
they
denied
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
our
court
faced
the
issue
very
squarely
and
said
the
precise
issue
was
whether
or
not
he
was
entitled
to
counsel
under
the
federal
or
state
constitution
is
in
this
hearing.
the
court
characterized
the
original
grant
of
probation
as
a
privilege
or
grace
and
exercise
of
the
chance
that
was
grace.
the
court
said
that
since
there
were
no
constitutional
rights
to
the
acquisition
of
probation
of
any
status,
there
were
likewise
no
constitutional
rights
surrounding
its
revocation.
the
court
characterized
this
whole
proceeding
as
essentially
quasi
administrative
in
nature,
saying
that
it
was
analogous
to
the
--
to
other
phases
of
penal
administration
within
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
he
had
been
--
i've
met
him
and
he
follows
decisions
of
this
court
very
closely
after
he
read
the
gideon
case,
he
started
thinking
about
this
and
wrote
his
own
petition
and
sent
it
in.
the
washington
supreme
court
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
after
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
now
that's
now
gone
by
the
boards.
after
this
court's
kent
decision,
our
court
begins
to
change
its
procedures
in
its
juvenile
area.
and
particularly
after
the
gault
decision
handed
down
by
this
court,
our
state
completely
revamped
its
procedures.
in
any
event,
during
--
mempa
was
17
when
this
arrest
occurred.
the
order
waiving
juvenile
jurisdiction
and
transferring
him
to
adult
authority
was
entered
while
he
was
an
escapee
from
juvenile
court
custody.
he
was
given
no
hearing
of
any
sort.
under
washington
state
law
now,
this
entitled
him
to
a
new
hearing
on
the
original
waiver
of
jurisdiction.
the
hearing
was
held
some
months
ago
in
spokane
superior
court
and
the
judge
concluded
that
the
original
waiver
of
jurisdiction
was
proper.
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that
has
been
washed
out.
that
was
pending
at
the
time
we
filed
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
that
was
when
he
was
17
your
honor,
when
he
was
first
arrested
in
joyriding,
they
had
him
and
he
ran
down
the
hall
and
got
away
and
he
gave
himself
up
a
few
days
later
with
his
stepfather.
since
then,
he
spent
time
in
monroe
which
is
our
reformatory
and
then
he
was
transferred
to
walla
walla
which
is
our
penitentiary
and
i
think
it
has
a
better
law
library
than
monroe.
our
state
supreme
court
concluded
its
opinion
in
this
case
by
stating
and
i
quote,
no
appeal
and
no
petition
for
habeas
corpus
will
be
successful
in
this
court
where
the
issue
is
whether
the
probationer
was
accorded
his
constitutional
due
process
rights
at
the
hearing.
the
answer
is
simple.
he
has
none.
i'd
now
like
to
turn
to
the
facts
in
number
22,
the
walkling
case.
they're
very
similar
and
i'll
try
to
go
through
them
a
little
faster.
in
1962,
mr.
walkling
was
arrested
and
charged
with
the
crime
of
burglary.
he
had
an
attorney
and
i
don't
know
if
he
was
appointed
or
not.
he
pleaded
guilty
and
the
court
placed
him
on
probation
for
three
years,
conditioned
upon
serving
90
days
in
jail.
in
1964,
the
charges
were
made
that
he
had
been
involved
in
several
counts
of
forgery.
he
was
arrested
and
brought
in
the
court
on
a
motion
to
revoke
probation.
on
the
day
he
appeared
which
was
in
may,
he
informed
the
court
that
he
needed
continuance
to
secure
an
attorney
and
incorporate
the
matter
over
one
week.
a
week
later,
mr.
walkling
was
in
court
at
9
o'clock
and
said,
your
honor,
i
think
an
olympia
lawyer
named
smith
troy
is
supposed
to
represent
me.
this
court
held
the
matter
in
advance
for
15
minutes
when
no
one
had
appeared
by
9:15,
the
court
proceeded.
mr.
walkling
did
not
have
counsel.
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
precisely
whether
or
not
he
requested
the
appointment
of
counsel
or
said
anything
further.
he
alleges
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
that
he
repeatedly
requested
counsel.
unfortunately,
either
reporters'
notes
were
not
made
of
that
hearing
or
if
made,
the
reporter
is
dead
and
no
one
can
find
the
notes.
so
we
have
no
concrete
proof
that
he
did
or
did
not
request
a
lawyer.
however,
in
the
record
is
an
affidavit
from
harold
cook
who
was
then
the
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
and
who
appeared
against
mr.
walkling.
mr.
cook
is
now
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
thurston
county.
in
his
affidavit,
mr.
cook
states
that
he
cannot
remember
what
exactly
happened
at
this
precise
hearing.
but
he
said,
judge
clifford
for
whom
this
matter
came
on
for
hearing
had
a
practice
on
all
probation
revocation
hearings
of
allowing
the
appearance
of
retained
counsel
but
he
took
the
position
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
appointed
counsel
for
indigence.
he
did
not
have
a
practice
of
advising
of
a
right
to
counsel
if
a
request
was
made
for
appointed
counsel,
his
practice
was
to
turn
it
down
but
he
always
accommodated
retained
counsel.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor.
no.
nothing
about
judge
clifford.
i
can
state
from
my
own
personal
knowledge
somewhat
what
judges
in
the
state
of
washington,
based
on
kings
county.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
in
a
limited
degree
it
is.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
there's
a
hearsay
problem
which
of
course
most
lawyers
will
object
to
it
and
try
to
do
something
about
and
i
think
the
lawyers
--
i
think
many
times,
it's
like
so
many
criminal
case
demands
cut,
red
handed
and
obviously
did
it
and
the
lawyer
spends
more
of
his
time
trying
to
negotiate
something,
trying
to
argue
that
notwithstanding
this
violation
the
man's
probation
should
not
be
revoked.
in
washington,
probation
can
be
revoked
for
very
minor
things.
for
example,
the
probationer's
neighbor
might
have
called
the
probation
officer
and
said,
i
saw
him
drinking
beer
in
the
tavern
last
friday
night.
this
maybe
a
violation
or
he's
been
out
after
curfew
or
he
left
the
county.
there
are
a
great
number
of
little
things
which
can
justify
revocation.
many
times,
the
lawyer
will
try
to
attack
those
and
try
to
argue
that
notwithstanding
this
the
man
should
be
left
on
probation.
most
lawyers
that
i
know
of
would
definitely
raise
the
hearsay
issue.
demand
a
right
of
confrontation
of
the
witnesses.
now
our
court
is
held
that
there
is
no
right
of
confrontation
in
these
hearings.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
right
of
confrontation?
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
think
there
should
be
a
right
of
confrontation
in
one
of
these
hearings.
my
basic
position
today
is
that
the
most
indispensable
element
in
one
of
these
hearings
is
the
right
of
counsel.
i
don't
think
from
those
flows
other
rights
but
i
think
that
is
the
one
thing
without
which
the
man
cannot
have
a
fair
hearing.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
i
am
your
honor
and
the
fourteenth.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
he
was
given
--
his
probation
was
revoked
and
he
was
sentenced
to
15
years
on
these
14
different
counts
of
forgery.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
that
is.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
initially,
he
was
placed
on
probation
for
three
years
which
means
in
the
state
of
washington
that
if
he
had
been
a
law
abiding
citizen
for
three
years,
he
could
have
been
made
a
motion
to
wipe
out
his
record
and
to
do
away
with
this
entire
offense
but
he
was
brought
in
on
this
forgery.
in
this
case
too,
the
probation
officer
was
the
only
one
who
testified.
he
testified
about
the
14
counts
that
were
alleged
against
this
man.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
the
walkling
case,
your
honor?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
mempa
--
mempa
was
only
sentenced
to
10
years.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
a
funny
thing
happened
in
the
mempa
case
which
i
will
be
happy
to
clarify
for
the
court.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
judge
said,
very
well,
it
is
further
judgment
of
the
court
that
you
will
be
confined
for
a
maximum
period
of
10
years.
and
now
i'm
going
to
suspend
every
bit
of
that
except
30
days.
that
sounds
like
a
suspended
sentence
instead
of
a
deferred
sentence.
so
the
prosecutor
then
said
because
your
honor,
actually,
what
you're
doing
is
placing
the
defendant
on
probation
and
the
judge
said,
yes,
that
is
the
effect
of
it
except
that
he
serves
15
days
and
i
would
make
it
for
two
years.
and
the
judge
says,
this
is
a
probationary
order
mr.
roe
with
the
exception
of
his
serving
30
days.
now,
the
actual
written
order
which
was
entered
in
the
mempa
case
was
an
order
of
probation
not
an
order
of
suspended
sentence.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
walkling,
that's
right.
well,
the
judge
in
mempa
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
nothing
of
significance
your
honor.
the
judge
in
the
mempa
case
--
these
were
different
judges,
had
the
suspended
sentence
and
deferred
sentence
somewhat
mixed
up
and
by
saying,
first,
i'm
going
to
sentence
you
but
i'm
going
to
suspend
it.
whereas
in
walkling,
the
judge
used
the
correct
terminology
without
even
referring
to
any
length
of
time
and
he
said,
i'm
going
to
defer
sentence
in
you
but
i
will
put
you
in
jail
for
90
days.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
there
wouldn't
be
doubt,
your
honor.
the
sentence
had
not
been
entered.
the
judge
was
free
in
the
first
case
if
probation
violation
subsequently
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
i
would
think
the
man
would
reasonably
expect
that
he
would
get
ten
years
but
the
judge
wasn't
obligated.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
with
one
exception
now
by
and
large
these
sentences
which
are
entered
in
the
state
of
washington
are
set
by
statute.
the
judge
generally
gives
the
maximum
sentence
whatever
the
statute
says,
he
then
makes
the
recommendations
to
what
he
thinks
the
minimum
should
be
and
then
the
state
board
of
prison
terms
and
paroles
has
a
final
decision
as
to
how
much
this
man
actually
has
to
serve.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it's
hard
for
me
to
answer
you,
your
honor.
i
really
don't
know
enough
about
it.
i
know
that
in
criminal
cases
i've
handled,
we
always
try
very
hard
to
get
a
low
recommendation
from
the
judge.
we
think
it's
important
in
practice
but
--
and
how
much
attention
is
paid,
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
depends
on
the
variety
of
the
type
of
offense
and
how
thoroughly
into
the
man's
background
the
judge
investigated.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
a
parole
your
honor
or
probation?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
rule
is
as
follows,
the
order
deferring
sentence
and
placing
the
man
in
probation
is
not
appealable
unless,
number
one,
it
was
entered
after
a
trial
on
the
merits;
and
number
two,
the
man
receive
a
small
amount
of
time
in
jail
as
a
condition
of
probation.
and
then
in
that
case,
the
appeal
is
limited
to
trial
error.
but
the
basic
rule
is
that
this
order
of
deferred
sentence
is
not
appealable.
this
i'll
get
to
you
later
in
my
argument.
the
first
time
the
man
has
a
right
of
appeal
is
later
when
probations
revoked
and
sentences
entered.
that
is
the
final
judgment
in
the
criminal
case
in
the
first
time
he
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
then
it
is,
and
it
brings
in
to
play
all
original
trial
errors.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor
at
least
for
that.
i
think
that's
an
easier
question
in
probation
revocation
but
it
would
create
a
weird
situation
in
which
the
right
to
counsel
would
cease
when
the
order
of
probation
was
entered,
there
would
be
no
right
to
counsel
until
probation
was
revoked
and
then
the
man
would
be
given
a
lawyer
for
sentencing.
but
i
think
sentencing
is
easier.
i
think
that
more
squarely
fits
within
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment.
that's
quite
obviously
part
of
the
criminal
prosecution.
i
maintain
that
this
whole
thing
is
--
this
all
takes
place
prior
to
sentencing.
i
don't
think
the
language
used
by
the
court
is
very
significant.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
i
would
prefer
to
see
this
case
decided
in
due
process,
sixth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds
because
i
think
the
equal
protection
argument,
by
analogy
the
douglas
versus
california
would
mean
that
if
the
state
legislature
decided
to
deprive
the
affluent
of
retained
counsel,
the
equal
protection
i
know
wouldn't
help
us
if
they
didn't
provide
the
hearing
at
all
in
this
case.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well
your
honor,
i
have
never
heard
of
a
situation
in
the
state
in
which
retain
counsel
was
not
allowed.
we
do
not
have
a
rule
of
court
or
a
statute
which
clearly
says
there's
a
right
to
retain
counsel
in
one
of
these
hearings.
but
as
the
dissent
pointed
out
below,
as
i
think
my
opponent
would
even
admit,
the
general
practices
to
allow
retained
counsel.
i've
never
heard
of
one
being
ordered
out
of
the
room.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no
your
honor.
no,
that
rarely
happens
in
one
of
these
setups.
it's
much
easier
to
revoke
his
original
probation
and
then
sentence
him
on
that
original
charge
and
that's
what
happened
here.
he
was
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
and
that's
where
he
was
until
he
also
filed
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it's
much
faster,
your
honor.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor,
never
trialed
on
that.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
now,
when
petitioner
walkling
filed
his
habeas
corpus
petition,
it
also
came
on
for
argument
below.
there,
the
argument
was
directed
at
the
continued
validity
of
the
mempa
decision
which
we've
been
discussing.
no
opinion
was
rendered
by
our
state
supreme
court
in
walkling
merely
cited
mempa
and
denied
habeas
corpus.
these
cases
then
were
brought
to
this
court.
monday
of
this
week,
this
court
granted
a
motion
substituting
the
parole
board
as
the
respondent
in
the
walkling
case
because
he
has
since
then
parole,
he
was
paroled
by
the
supreme.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh
yes
your
honor.
i
can't
distinguish
them
at
all.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
i
can't.
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
at
this
point
to
what
is
involved
at
a
probation
revocation
here
in
the
states.
to
summarize
them
quickly,
the
man's
liberty
is
obviously
at
stake.
this
proceeding
is
convened
to
pass
upon
whether
or
not
he
should
go
to
jail
or
not.
his
reputation
is
at
stake.
is
he
going
to
now
lose
his
chance
to
clear
his
record
someday?
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
a
man
who
lives
up
to
the
terms
of
his
probation
can
move
to
have
his
record
cleared.
this
is
a
very
significant
right.
so
his
future
record
is
involved
in
this
hearing.
his
appellant
remedies
are
involved
and
most
significantly,
this
is
going
to
be
the
hearing
at
which
for
the
first
time,
he
is
sentenced
on
a
criminal
charge.
now,
in
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
you
carved
out
right
to
counsel
in
many
stages
with
the
proceeding
against
an
accused.
the
names
of
some
of
the
cases
of
course
would
be
gideon,
douglas,
escobedo,
miranda,
kent
and
gault.
but
a
small
area
still
remains
in
which
there
is
no
right
to
counsel
rules.
professor
catey
(ph)
has
called
this
the
penal
correctional
gap
that
includes
such
things
as
probation,
suspended
sentences
and
parole.
this
case,
we
think
clearly
presents
an
issue
in
one
small
phase
of
this
gap.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
your
honor.
they
could
not
have
appealed
at
that
point.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
back
at
the
time,
because
there
have
been
no
contested
trial--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
you
have
to
have
a
trial
on
the
merits,
a
conviction
and
time
in
jail
and
then
you
can
appeal.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
--
and
our
court
has
been
very
consistent
in
that
out
there.
they
will
not
entertain
those
appeals.
now,
the
interesting
thing
in
the
mempa
case
is
this.
he'd
pleaded
guilty
to
the
crime
of
joyriding
and
of
course
there
would
not
be
much
that
he
could
appeal
but
he
did
have
an
appealable
ground
as
subsequently
appeared.
of
course,
i
don't
think
many
lawyers
would
have
been
smart
enough
to
think
of
it
at
the
time
but
since
he
was
a
juvenile
and
his
exclusive
--
and
since
the
juvenile
court
had
waived
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
him
without
a
hearing,
he
had
a
constitutional
argument
which
could
have
been
raised
by
appeal.
now,
a
smart
lawyer
might
have
thought
of
that.
this
might
have
come
up
years
before
this
court's
decision
in
kent
and
gault.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
he
did
and
the
lawyer
wasn't
smart
to
think
but
i'm
just
pointing
this
out
to
say
that
there
was
an
appealable
ground
but
of
course
it
wasn't
appealable.
he
got
probation.
he
could
not
have
appealed
and
raised
that
point.
he
even
had
a
--
the
only
--
even
if
he'd
wanted.
his
lawyer
would
have
had
to
say,
we
turn
down
probation,
we
don't
want
it.
we
want
you
to
enter
judgment
and
sentence
and
then
we
can
appeal
on
this
point.
that's
the
only
way
he
could
have
taken
the
question
up.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no.
no,
that's
very
common,
your
honor.
the
courts
usually
reserved
probation
for
people
who
have
no
record,
first
offenders.
but
it's
common
to
give
them
some
small
period
of
time
in
jail
to
give
them
some
punishment
on
this
because
typically,
the
man
may
have
been
bailed
right
after
he
was
originally
arrested.
he's
only
spent
one
or
two
days
in
jail
and
the
court
thinks,
well,
i
want
to
give
this
man
a
chance
to
see
if
we
can
rehabilitate
him
but
i'll
give
him
some
short
period
in
the
county
jail
to
let
him
see
how
serious
this
is.
some
criminologists
argue
that
the
first
30
days
a
man
ever
served
are
the
toughest.
those
are
the
30
that
he
really
feels.
now,
i'm
sure
it's
true.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
now,
the
washington
court
has
said
that
this
hearing
is
quasi
administrative,
that
it's
analogous
to
penal
administration.
the
court
seems
to
be
saying
that
this
is
not
a
criminal
hearing
and
therefore
these
constitutional
rights
don't
come
into
play.
this
is
an
essence
on
what
my
opponent
argues.
we
submit
that
the
labels
applied
to
this
hearing
by
the
lower
court
are
not
sufficient
to
avoid
the
thrust
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
concepts
and
protections
that
which
should
give.
i
think
this
was
decided
by
this
court
in
kent
and
gault
with
labels
and
characterizations
are
not
enough
to
get
around
the
due
process
considerations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
he
would
have
to
be
under
this
court's
decisions.
i
do
not
as
a
practical
matter
whether
or
not
this
has
come
up
because
i
think
it's
fairly
unusual
for
a
man
to
appeal
after
probation
is
revoked.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
he
has
the
right
to
appeal.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
doubt
if
our
courts
go
through
the
motions
of
advising
him
of
his
right.
i
don't
really
know.
i'm
not
that
familiar
so
i
can't
tell
you
what
the
practice
is.
now,
our
court
has
also
laid
great
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
the
original
granting
of
probation
as
an
exercise
of
the
chance
is
grace.
the
court
has
said
there
are
no
constitutional
rights
to
the
acquisition
of
probationary
status,
there
are
likewise,
no
rights
surrounding
its
revocation.
they
rely
on
this
old
concept
of
the
chancellors'
grace,
right
of
privilege
concept.
this
is
based
on
i
think
the
old
the
case
of
esco
versus
(inaudible)
it's
indicted
by
mr.
justice
cardozo.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
really
cannot
help
you
on
that
precise
point.
my
understanding
of
the
practice
in
other
states
is
that
virtually
all
the
states
have
a
probation
system.
many
do
not
make
the
split
we
do
between
deferred
sentences
and
suspended
sentences
and
many
of
them,
and
i
think
in
the
federal
system,
judgment
has
entered,
the
sentence
is
entered
but
it's
suspended.
this
is
called
probation
in
that
system.
probation
can
apply
to
both
of
these
situations.
the
accurate
terminology
would
be
one
is
a
deferred
sentence
and
one
is
a
suspended
sentence.
i
do
not
know
what
the
appeal
situation
is.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
our
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
gideon
applies
equally
to
this
procedure.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
it
would,
your
honor
regardless
of
the
appeal
point.
i
think
the
fundamental
thing
here
is
the
fact
that
a
man's
liberty
is
at
stake.
he
is
brought
into
a
court
and
there's
a
judge
on
the
bench,
there's
a
prosecutor
at
the
other
table,
the
testimony
is
taken
and
his
liberty
is
at
stake.
his
right
to
a
clear
record
is
at
stake.
these
are
fundamental
rights.
this
is
obviously
a
very
critical
stage.
now
regardless
of
appeal
questions
whether
it
could
have
appealed
last
year
or
now,
regardless
of
what
the
court
calls
it,
i
think
quite
clearly,
he's
entitled
to
do
process
applied
in
this
hearing.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
the
state
of
washington.
that's
right,
which
makes
it,
i
think
easier
to
argue
that
this
is
part
of
the
sixth
amendment
protection
but
if
in
states
where
this
is
not
the
terminal
stage,
if
this
is
a
state
where
the
writer
--
where
the
sentence
had
already
been
entered
then
i
think
we
can
rely
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth.
regardless
of
whether
we
call
this
criminal,
civil
or
what
have
you
if
liberty
is
at
stake,
and
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
due
process.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
this
case
doesn't
present
that.
now
our
--
we
only
present
counsel
issues
here.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
don't
think
--
i
see
where
you're
leading
but
i
--
in
the
normal
sentencing
procedure
from
divorce
probation
concepts,
testimony
is
not
taken
in
an
open
court.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
judge
looks
elsewhere.
i
realize
that
the
case
law
is
that
there's
no
right
of
confrontation
of
those
sources
of
information
which
the
judge
relies
on.
i
think
that
when
a
person
is
brought
in
a
court
and
placed
on
the
stand
when
testimony
is
taken,
when
there
are
issues
of
fact
and
a
new
fact
finding
process
is
taking
place
then
i
think
there's
a
right
of
confrontation.
i'm
going
beyond
my
case.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
can't
--
i
think
there
should
be
but
i'm
not
prepared
today
to
argue
what
the
constitution
requires
but
i
prefer
to
stay
within
the
confines
of
right
to
counsel
issue
because
i
think
that's
much
easier.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
absolutely,
your
honor.
this
is
a
hearing
in
the
court
with
witnesses.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
a
prosecutor.
this
is
a
very
vital
and
critical
proceeding
against
this
man
regardless
of
what
we
got.
now,
this
court
is
held
in
the
area
of
economic
privileges
if
they
cannot
arbitrarily
be
withdrawn
even
though
the
granting
of
a
certain
federal
benefits
maybe
a
privilege
but
that
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
you
can
just
arbitrarily
pull
them
back.
i
think
the
dicta
in
esco
versus
(inaudible)
is
kind
of
been
eroded
for
the
passage
of
time
in
subsequent
cases
in
this
court.
in
gault
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh
yes
your
honor,
very
definitely.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
there
are
two
other
cases
that
bear
on
this.
one
is
townsend
versus
burke
in
which
this
court
had
before
it
the
issue
of
the
right
to
counsel
at
sentencing.
in
that
case
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
townsend
versus
burke.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
would
you
like
to
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
issue
there
was
right
to
counsel
at
sentencing.
this
is
a
pre-gideon
case.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i
regard
them
as
in
way
separable
issues
as
far
as
the
probation
revocation
hearing
is
concerned
and
testimony
is
taken
and
this
is
very
much
like
a
trial,
issues
of
facts
they've
presented.
i
think
there's
a
need
for
counsel
there
under
gideon,
under
basic
due
process
concepts
that
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
i'm
presenting
both.
under
sentencing,
i
rely,
i
can
first
use
the
other
arguments
but
i
think
there
are
separate
arguments
available
on
sentencing,
namely
the
townsend
versus
burke,
the
moore
case
and
gideon.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
if
sentencing
presents
a
narrower
way
to
decide
this
case
without
dealing
with
the
probation
hearing,
this
wouldn't
answer
very
many
questions
because
it
would
be
easy
to
restructure
the
system.
if
this
court
dealt
only
with
the
sentencing
issue
citing
say
townsend
and
gideon,
i
don't
think
that
the
case
would
have
much
of
an
impact
upon
the
federal
practice
where
sentences
entered
and
then
suspended.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
on
parole
hearings,
we
have
a
statute
which
provides
that
you
have
a
right
to
counsel
at
parole
hearings.
this
is
construed
i
believe
to
mean
only
retain
counsel.
so
we
have
the
anomaly
situation
in
washington
where
we
know
there's
a
right
to
retain
counsel
at
a
parole
hearing
but
we
have
nothing
expressly
giving
us
the
right
to
retain
counsel
at
probation
hearings.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
they
don't
appoint
counsel,
that's
quite
right
in
parole
hearings.
i
don't
know
of
any
jurisdiction
that
does
that.
i
remember
that
several
years
ago,
there
were
some
cases
in
the
dc
circuit.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i'm
not
--
that's
on
parole
or
probation.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
my
contention
today
is
limited
to
probation,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
would
be
my
contention.
now
people
--
i
like
to
deal
with
the
gault
case
for
a
minute
and
i
think
the
gault
case
comes
very
close
to
what
we're
dealing
with
here
today.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
there's
a
right
to
counsel
in
a
proceeding.
it
is
determined
that
the
child
is
delinquent
and
is
to
be
subjected
to
the
lost
of
his
liberty.
this
is
very
similar
to
what
we
have
here.
characterization
questions
were
branched
aside
and
called
as
to
whether
it's
criminal
or
civil,
what
have
you.
i
think
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
this
fact
pattern.
now,
the
argument
has
been
advanced
by
commentators
and
that
an
attorney
is
not
necessary
in
one
of
these
hearings,
that
the
man
has
had
plenty
of
breaks
already.
the
probation
officers
lean
over
backwards
to
be
fair
as
the
state
of
florida
has
said
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
against
me,
everybody
knows
that
probation
officers
are
fair
and
not
arbitrary.
i
think
there's
quite
a
deal
that
attorneys
can
do.
i'd
like
to
point
out
some
of
the
things.
if
there
are
issues
of
fact
and
there
are
frequently
are,
only
an
attorney
can
effectively
marshal
the
evidence,
bring
it
together
and
put
on
a
case,
put
on
a
defense.
the
probationer
generally
is
in
jail
being
held,
awaiting
his
hearing.
the
attorney
can
build
his
defense.
he
can
cross-examine
the
probation
officer
or
the
other
witnesses
who
are
called
against
him.
he
can
object
to
improper
procedure.
he
can
raise
a
hearsay
objection
although
he
may
not
get
ready
for
it.
questions
of
law
can
be
involved.
first
of
all,
are
there
sufficient
grounds
to
revoke
probation?
in
the
state
of
washington,
probation
can
only
be
revoked
for
cause.
our
statute
says
that
if
the
man
violates
the
terms
of
his
probation,
that
means
the
rules
lay
down
by
the
probation
board
having
to
do
with
hours
he
keeps,
type
of
life
he
lives;
or
secondly,
if
he
is
abandoned
to
improper
associates,
he
can
have
his
probation
revoked,
or
if
he
is
engaging
in
criminal
practices,
he
can
end
up
revoked;
lastly,
if
he
is
living
a
vicious
life.
now
i'm
not
raising
any
vaugeness
problems
today
but
i
don't
know
what
that
one
means.
i
think
this
raises
a
need
for
lawyer
though.
i
think
a
lawyer
would
want
to
raise
at
the
hearing
what
if
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
our
statute
directs
that
on
the
revocation,
he
is
to
brought
back
before
the
judge.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
i've
not
your
honor.
i
never
have.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
there
are
two
other
conditions
to
have.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
it
would
your
honor.
you
see
that
the
review
on
trial
error
is
limited
to
the
appeal
which
is
taken
when
probation
is
originally
granted
and
not
wanting
to
revoke.
once
probation
is
revoked
and
sentences
entered
then
an
appeal
can
be
taken
covering
the
original
trial,
the
revocation
and
probation
and
the
sentence.
everything
then
would
go
up.
now,
our
case
law
provides
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
over
turn
a
trial
court's
decision
revoking
probation.
this
is
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
there
are
no
burden
approved
rules
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
court
simply
says
that
if
the
courts
convinced
the
man
violate
with
the
terms
of
probation.
so
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
in
which
our
court
is
overturned
to
trial
court
finding.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh
yes
your
honor,
that's
right.
now,
going
back
to
what
the
lawyer
could
do
at
this
revocation
hearing,
ignoring
for
a
moment
issues
of
fact
which
i
have
discussed,
he
would
want
to
determine
and
argued
to
the
court
first
of
all
that
cause
have
not
been
made
out
for
revocation
and
probation.
but
assume
the
judge
disagreed
and
felt
that
there
is
a
requisite
cause
to
revoke
then
the
attorney
can
present
mitigating
circumstances
in
an
attempt
to
persuade
the
court
to
leave
the
man
on
probation
and
notwithstanding
the
violation.
this
would
be
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge
or
if
that's
resolved
against
the
attorney,
he
can
then
deal
with
the
sentencing
issue
and
try
to
have
matters
and
mitigation
of
sentence
considered
which
would
go
to
a
low
recommendation
from
the
judge.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
because
there
are
cases
which
say
that
the
language
of
criminal
prosecution
under
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
be
construed
technically
so
i
can
conceive
of
the
argument
being
made
that
if
sentencing
had
already
occurred
and
then
the
man
was
placed
on
probation.
the
criminal
prosecution
might
have
come
to
an
end
and
therefore
those
concepts
don't
apply.
so
i
think
there
are
two
grounds
but
i
think
under
gault
and
cases
like
that.
this
is
a
critical
stage
at
which
due
process
rights
to
counsel
apply.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
we
depend
on
the
way
that
this
--
an
opinion
in
this
case
was
phrased
if
the
court
ruled
in
this
case
solely
on
the
sentencing
ground.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
re
gault
sort
of
concepts.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
then
it
might
apply
to
parole
arguably
because
there
too
with
the
man's
liberty
is
at
stake.
the
one
difference
though
is
that
parole
doesn't
occur
in
court.
this
does
--
this
is
the
court,
there's
a
judge
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
they
are
done
administrative.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
a
matter
which
is
vested
in
the
discretion
either
of
the
judge
or
in
the
case
of
parole
and
the
parole
board.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
factors
that
we
consider.
i
accept
the
argument
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
the
acquisition
of
the
status.
i
think
the
rights
come
into
play
once
this
conditional
liberty
is
given
to
the
man.
now,
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
the
national
legal
aid
and
defender
association,
points
out
that
11
states
already
appoint
counsel
in
these
hearings.
and
these
states
make
up
roughly
one-fourth
of
the
population.
they've
taken
a
survey
and
they
found
that
certain
counties
in
roughly
24
other
states
also
appoint
counsel.
some
counties
do
and
don't.
they
have
no
rigid
rule
in
their
state.
this
raises
it
to
roughly
one-half
of
the
population
in
this
country.
one-half
of
the
courts
already
appoint
counsel,
the
others
don't.
only
three
states
within
this
country
say
that
there's
no
right
to
a
hearing
at
all
on
probation
revocation.
three
states
say
that
the
probation
officer
can
arrest
the
man
and
throw
him
in
jail
and
that
seem
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
they're
in
this
brief.
i'll
be
happy
to
read
them
for
you.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
don't
remember
them.
there
are
so
many
different
statistics
on
states
and
they
line
up
in
different
ways.
the
trend
of
expert
opinion
in
writing
in
the
field
that
supports
the
right
to
counsel
just
to
point
out
three
things,
the
president's
commission
on
crime
and
administration
of
justice
recommended
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
probation
revocation
hearings.
american
bar
association
committees
which
have
studied
this
recommend
the
same
thing
in
ali
model
penal
code
it's
recommended
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
probation
revocation
hearings.
in
so
far
as
burdens
on
the
system
are
concerned,
i'd
like
to
make
--
to
give
the
court
the
benefit
of
some
of
the
information
in
this
brief.
in
1965
in
the
state
system,
144,000
people
were
placed
on
probation.
the
average
probation
case
load
on
1965,
in
other
words,
the
total
average
daily
number
of
people
on
probation
during
the
year
was
230,000.
the
average
number
of
revocations
during
that
year
totaled
roughly
one
third
of
that.
so
we're
talking
similar
between
30,000
to
40,000
probation
revocations
a
year.
i
think
this
can
be
handled
very
easily
within
our
existing
system
for
appointing
counsel
as
result
of
this
court's
gideon
decision,
every
state
now
has
either
a
defender
system
or
a
system
for
appointing
local
members
of
the
bar.
if
a
man
had
been
appointed
to
represent
this
fellow
on
his
original
charge,
it
makes
sense
to
appoint
that
same
lawyer
on
the
probation
revocation.
he
argued
for
probation
and
now
if
it's
to
be
revoked,
he
should
come
back
and
represent
this
man.
he
has
a
file
on
the
case,
he
knows
him.
i
think
these
ideas
of
appointing
lawyers
for
this
were
just
working
very
easily
within
our
existing
system.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
this
case
doesn't
present
those.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
that
the
court
can
treat
probation
revocation
hearings
and
parole
revocation
hearings
as
a
special
sort
of
hearing.
we
have
to
look
at
the
fact
that
this
man
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
involving
less
technical
concepts
in
the
trial.
the
man
had
his
trial
or
at
least
he
has
a
right
to
it.
he
either
pleaded
guilty
or
he
was
convicted.
he
has
been
given
a
certain
conditional
liberty
by
the
state.
i
don't
think
he
needs
a
brand
new
trial
with
all
of
the
technical
and
full
blown
rights
when
they
want
to
revoke
this.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
--
well,
as
i
rank
them,
i
think
the
right
of
counsel
is
number
one,
the
most
important.
i
think
if
there
is
an
issue
of
fact,
he
should
have
confrontation.
i
think
i
would
tend
to
treat
it
more
like
a
civil
case
perhaps
with
no
right
to
a
jury
with
the
burden
of
proof
rule
being
generally
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
if
the
judge
believes
if
there
has
been
a
violation,
he
can
send
the
man
back
to
jail.
but
i
think
confrontation
is
essential.
it
might
be
a
malicious
neighbor
who
claims
this
man
as
keeping
bad
hours
or
associating
with
criminals
and
if
the
probation
officer
is
the
only
one
to
testify
the
hearings
of
course
and
nothing
can
be
accomplished.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
he
can,
your
honor
and
it's
commonly
done.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
was
involved
in
a
case
in
reno
in
which
the
judge
conditioned
probation
on
not
seeing
a
particular
woman
for
a
year
or
over
a
period,
i
think
it
was.
he
also
required
the
defendant
to
leave
the
state.
commonly,
they
require
the
defendant
to
make
restitution
to
the
victim.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor,
they
do.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
i
would
like
to
deal
for
a
moment
with
equal
protection.
also
i
pointed
out
we
have
no
statutory
judicial
requirement
of
appointed
counsel
in
the
state
with
the
factor
--
but
the
practice
is,
that
these
men
are
given
hearings
to
the
court
retained
counsel
are
permitted
to
appear.
the
affluent
probationer
is
allowed
counsel
indigent
was
found
for
himself.
i
think
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
under
the
cases
such
as
douglas
and
griffin.
thank
you.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
this
is
it.
well,
the
petitioner
--
probationer
can
turn
this
down.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
no,
i
don't
believe
it
as
a
matter
of
law
with
all
--
the
parole
board
may
if
it
wishes
considered
as
at
a
later
day.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
they
would.
i
would
think
so
particularly
if
it
was
a
lengthy
period
like
one
year,
thirty
days
or
two
weeks
they
might
not.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
believe
it
could
your
honor,
yes.
because
judgment
and
sentence
would
have
been
entered
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--
and
execution
deferred.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
so
a
final
order
would
have
been
entered,
an
appealable
order
and
i
believe
an
appeal
could
be
taken
from
that.
now,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
this
court
if
it
upholds
the
right
to
counsel
in
this
case
is
then
leading
itself
into
finding
other
constitutional
rights
and
probation
revocation
hearings,
namely
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
the
right
of
consultation,
the
right
to
an
indictment.
i
don't
think
this
necessarily
follows.
we're
talking
about
deprivations
of
liberty
and
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
primarily.
the
man
has
been
either
tried
or
he's
pleaded
guilty.
he
has
had
his
essential
criminal
trial
with
all
of
its
historical
safeguards.
this
is
a
new
type
of
proceeding.
due
process
i
think
requires
something
less
in
this
sort
of
a
proceeding.
i
see
no
reason
why
you
would
have
to
be
indicted
over
a
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
and
further,
the
hearing
itself,
the
probation
revocation
hearing
itself,
i
do
not
make
strictly
under
sixth
amendment
grounds.
i'm
not
saying
it
is
a
criminal
--
its
part
of
the
criminal
process
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it's
part
of
a
criminal
prosecution
but
not
a
separate
one,
not
to
be
carved
out
by
itself.
he
was
indicted
originally
when
he
was
arrested.
he
was
either
indicted
or
proceeded
against
by
information.
he
had
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
he
either
availed
himself
or
he
pleaded
guilty
or
he
waived
it.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
part
your
honor,
yes
i
do.
well,
i
think
this
is
part
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
i
think
all
proceedings
dealing
with
a
man
by
the
state
in
which
his
liberty
is
at
stake,
his
ability
to
remain
on
the
street
or
be
behind
bars
is
part
of
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
this
is
something
that
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--
that's
a
collateral
thing.
i
don't
--
his
criminal
prosecution
is
over.
they
made
the
decision.
they
put
him
away
and
it's
a
closed
book.
he
now
raises
new
issues
collaterally
by
habeas
corpus
or
in
the
federal
system
under
2255.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
i
don't
think
anything
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
and
i
--
well,
i
--
there
are
a
lot
of
practical
difficulties
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--
this
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
i
would
put
it
this
way.
i
don't
think
he
should
get
a
lawyer
to
prepare
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
or
to
argue
before
the
judge
initially.
the
judges
i
know
received
this
in
a
mail
by
this
court
and
many
of
them
are
frivolous.
but
if
a
hearing
is
to
be
held
in
court,
i
would
submit
there
should
be
a
right
to
counsel.
i
don't
think
a
man
should
ever
have
to
come
in
to
a
court
of
law
without
a
lawyer.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
don't
think
hearings
take
place
on
the
bulk
of
the
habeas
corpus
petitions.
i
think
that
they're
--
my
understanding
is
that
many
of
them
are
regarded
as
frivolous
by
the
judge
when
he
receives
them
and
just
deny
without
hearing.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
haven't
looked
it
up.
i
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
figures
we
have
on
probation
is
that
in
the
year
1965
in
the
state
courts,
i
think
it
was
a
146,000
persons
were
placed
on
probation
and
the
average
daily
case
load
of
persons
actually
serving
on
probation
that
year
was
about
230,000.
revocation
proceedings
seem
to
run
about
a
third
of
the
average
case
load,
roughly
one
third
of
this
people
violate.
so
this
would
be
around
40
--
35
to
40,
45,000
people
per
year.
and
of
course,
i
assume
it
would
go
up
each
year,
gets
larger.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
this
is
something
i
would
assume
a
lawyer
would
ask
for.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
you
could.
and
i
found
no
authority
on
that
and
i'm
sure
there
is
no
mistake
but
i'm
quite
sure
he
could
because
his
lawyer
will
be
arguing
or
at
least
he
will
be
arguing
to
keep
this
down
and
hold
this
to
a
minimum.
the
judge
has
the
great
deal
of
discretion
in
this
area.
the
judge
could
say
i'm
not
going
to
revoke
but
here's
a
new
condition,
some
period
of
time
in
the
county
jail
up
to
a
year,
the
statute
only
authorizes
the
year
in
jail.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
the
case
will
be
remanded.
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
will
issue.
he
will
then
be
entitled
to
a
new
probation
revocation
hearing
and
a
counsel
would
be
assigned.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
almost.
we
would
hope
to
negotiate
with
a
(inaudible)
authorities
and
have
them
just
forget
about
it,
put
him
back
in
probation
whether
that
goes
through
a
hearing.
he
will
serve
eight
years
and
nothing
much
is
to
be
gained
by
it.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
would
--
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
inference
your
honor
--
it's
in
the
record
(voice
overlap).
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
well
in
fact
your
honor
is
walkling
demonstrates
very
well
the
probation
authority
is
usually
the
ones
who
initiate
the
violation
proceedings.
the
probation
officer
here
is
an
employee
of
the
state
board
of
prison
terms
and
paroles
and
he
is
the
one
who
testified
as
to
these
14
counts
of
forgery
and
14
counts
of
larceny.
so
he
obviously
believe
that
there
was
a
merit
to
them
and
that
the
man
should
be
revoked
so
i'm
quite
sure
this
would
play
a
factor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
i
do
your
honor.
its
rcw
9.95.220,
entitled
violation
of
probation,
arrest,
imprisonment
and
tells
when
he
can
be
revoked.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes.
they're
in
the
appendix
to
our
--
on
the
brief
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
beg
your
--
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
because
he
has
already
had
those
protections
in
connection
with
the
original
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
quite
right
but
i
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
new
crime,
that's
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
i
don't
think
there's
any
issue
there.
i
can
think
of
no
situation
in
which
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
because
i
think
a
lawyer
in
this
setting
of
what
is
actually
going
on
is
more
fundamentally
essential
than
the
jury.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
this
is
not
--
technically,
a
new
criminal
proceeding
against
him.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
they're
trying
to
revoke
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well
i
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
i
have
not
tried
to
maintain
that
he
in
essence,
being
tried
for
new
crimes
in
this
probation
revocation
hearing.
many
times,
the
alleged
violation
is
not
a
new
crime.
it
might
be
the
fact
that
it
kept
late
hours.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
many
times
it
is.
it
may
be
a
new
trial.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
there
are
issues
of
fact
in
this
hearing.
that's
right.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
if
the
state
repealed
the
probation
law?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
i
think
there
might
be
a
chance
if
they
would
repeal
it
into
a
way
with
the
system
--
they'd
be
torn
obviously
because
on
the
one
hand,
they
hope
to
rehabilitate
people
but
on
the
other
hand,
they
can
only
do
it
within
the
framework
of
what's
feasible.
this
is
--
this
partially
affects
my
argument
and
my
feelings
about
a
jury
in
one
of
those
things.
i
don't
think
that's
feasible.
i
think
a
lawyer
is.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i
regard
the
right
to
counsel
your
honor
as
being
so
important
that
at
least
that's
number
one
that
a
person
can
decide
that
without
going
to
the
next
step
but
the
other
ones
get
harder.
you
can
have
a
fair
hearing
without
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
a
jury
trial
is
a
difficult
situation
in
this
setting
your
honor.
i
think
this
would
have
a
definite
impact
on
the
use
of
the
probation
system.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
because
it
would
require
in
essence
two
the
trials.
i
think
we
would
find
judges
using
them.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
don't
think
the
presence
of
assigned
counsel
would
change
that
many
hearings.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
many
of
them
have
written
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
it
should
be.
i
think
there
--
if
he
does
not
admit
the
violation
and
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
don't
think
they
should
if
he
wants
to
contest
the
issues
of
fact,
i
think
he
should
be
confronted
with
these
witnesses.
someone
has
accused
him
of
something.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
that
should
follow,
yes
if
there's
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
on
page
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
on
page
20,
we
have
the
order
of
probation
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
typically
when
the
court
enters
an
order
like
this,
the
lawyer
and
his
client
or
the
client
if
he
is
there,
walk
across
the
street
in
seattle
at
least
to
the
probation
office
and
arrange
an
interview
and
he
sits
down,
he's
given
a
list
of
do's
and
don'ts
and
he
has
a
--
he
meets
his
probation
officer
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--
and
work
out
their
ground
rules.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right.
they
have
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
we
can
--
i
could
be
--
i'd
be
happy
to
get
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
i
don't
know
if
they're
in
published
form
or
not
or
if
they're
merely
internal
regulations
for
uses
in
the
board.
i've
had
no
contact
with
these
regulations.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh
yes.
you're
definitely
correct.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
this
is
comperable
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i
actually
walked
the
client
over
that
office
one
time
and
as
i
recall
when
i
looked
at
the
list,
it
had
all
sorts
of
things
about
hours
that
he
had
to
keep,
places
to
live.
he
couldn't
leave
the
county
i
believe
without
getting
permission.
he
couldn't
own
a
car
without
getting
permission
from
the
board
that
sort
of
restrictions
were
placed
upon
him.
they
gave
him
a
little
--
some
kind
of
a
mimeograph
form
they
hand
out
to
these
people
and
they're
required
to
report
back
at
periodic
intervals.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes
you
did
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
it
was
williams.
i
believe
your
honor
wrote
that
opinion
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--
and
the
holding
was
that
the
judge
could
rely
on
material
which
has
not
been
subjected
to
a
cross-examination
contradiction.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
holding
was
that
the
judge
could
rely
on
this
material
which
had
not
been
seen
by
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it
was
as
i
recall,
it
was
based
on
a
concept
that
since
the
conviction
had
already
been
entered
since
the
man
is
either
been
found
guilty
or
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
--
more
technical
due
process
rights
ceased
and
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
the
ones
that
apply
more
--
in
a
more
technical
sense
to
trial
is
what
i
mean.
the
--
i
read
--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i
don't
consider
them
technical
either
your
honor
but
i
--
what
i'm
trying
to
say
was
that
some
of
them
were
deemed
to
apply
only
to
trial
up
to
the
point
of
conviction
that
now
since
the
man
had
been
convicted,
the
judge
could
rely
on
a
greater
variety
of
material
if
this
had
been
done
historically.
the
courts
have
tried
to
consider
all
the
material
they
could
get
their
hands
on
that
might
help
them
enter
an
informed
decision
in
connection
with
the
sentence.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
we
don't
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
on
right
to
counsel
issues?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
i
think
it
does
have
a
bearing
your
honor.
thank
you.
