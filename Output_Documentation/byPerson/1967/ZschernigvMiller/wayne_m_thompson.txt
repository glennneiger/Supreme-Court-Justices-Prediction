mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there’s
one
fact
in
addition
to
those
that
mr.
schwabe’s
has
presented
before
the
court
that
i’d
like
to
mention
to
the
court
as
it
maybe
called
upon
to
bear
some
weight.
and
that
is
that
in
the
findings
in
order
of
the
probate
court
in
the
state
of
oregon
it
was
stated
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
make
a
finding
of
reciprocity
under
the
requirements
of
oregon
revised
statutes,
the
reciprocal
inheritance
right
statute
to
find
reciprocity
with
the
german
democratic
republic.
there
was
originally
no
evidence
on
this
basis.
the
only
testimony
was
that
of
dr
hess
kaufman
(ph)
who
was
the
counsel
for
the
northwestern
united
states
in
seattle
and
his
testimony
relates
almost
exclusively
to
the
construction
of
the
treaties,
the
authority
of
the
federal
republic
and
things
of
this
nature.
there
was
very
little
if
anything
that
could
be
directly
related
to
the
rights
or
to
the
laws
of
east
germany,
the
german
democratic
republic.
we
are
here
concerned
very
simply
stated
with
whether
the
oregon
revised
statute
11107,
the
reciprocal
inheritance
law
is
an
unconstitutional
invasion
of
the
federal
government's
right
to
govern
and
regulate
foreign
affairs
under
article
i,
section
8
and
10
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now
as
has
been
recognized
by
the
court,
this
brings
into
new
focus
again
the
case
of
clark
versus
allen.
we’re
here
concerned
with
only
one
of
the
questions
of
clark
versus
allen,
entered
upon
and
decided.
however,
the
two
cases
are
remarkably
similar.
once
again
we
have
german
nationals,
we
are
concerned
with
the
1923
treaty,
we
are
concerned
with
state
reciprocity
statutes,
we
are
concerned
with
similar
state
reciprocity
statute
here
oregon
and
california.
the
largest
differences
exist
between
the
fact
or
in
the
facts
that
germany
has
since
been
divided
and
we
do
not
recognize
the
east
germany
as
the,
under
a
form
of
government
which
is
i
should
say
we
do
not
recognize
it
is
having
a
sovereign
government,
we
recognize
the
occupation
of
soviet
russia.
another
difference
we
have,
the
new
treaty
of
1954,
the
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation
between
united
states
and
the
federal
republic.
finally,
we
have
the
guidepost
decision
of
clark
versus
allen
which
did
not
exist
at
that
time.
now,
the
position
of
the
state
of
oregon
is
that
this
court’s
decision
in
clark
versus
allen
was
a
determination
that
still
continued
in
its
validity
and
application
on
this
particular
question
that
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
reciprocal
inheritance
statute.
this
is
because
as
was
stated
in
that
case,
in
the
absence
of
a
conflicting
overriding
federal
policy
that
the
right
of
the
states
to
govern,
control,
and
regulate
the
disposition
or
succession
to
estates
within
their
territories
would
remain
in
the
states.
now
we
submit
that
here
there
is
no
overriding
of
federal
policy.
there
could
be
policy
if
any
can
be
said
to
exist
is
that
this
does
not
conflict
the
state
department
had
said
so
through
the
briefs
of
the
solicitor
general
upon
the
request
of,
which
is
provided
upon
the
request
of
the
court.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
was
saying
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
oregon
in
this
case
that
the
determination
in
clark
versus
allen
on
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
state
reciprocity
statutes
continues
to
be
a
valid
and
applicable
principle
that
though
the
state
acts
may
indirectly
affect
foreign
countries
and
as
is
the
state
reciprocity
statutes,
that
in
the
absence
of
a
conflicting
and
overriding
federal
policy
that
the
state
should
continue
to
be
allowed
to
regulate
the
succession
in
disposition
of
the
estates
within
the
boundaries
of
those
states.
now
here
we
have
no
conflicting
federal
policy.
in
fact
the
position
of
the
federal
government
has
been
made
clear
in
their
memorandum
brief
at
the
request
to
the
court.
in
answer
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
they
indicated
that
as
has
been
stated
here
that
such
acts
including
the
oregon
statute
have
had
little
effect.
further,
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
they
have
stated
that
the
government’s
position
is
no
way
or
they
do
not
contend
that
the
oregon
statute
constitutes
an
undue
interference
in
foreign
relations.
now,
regarding
this
position
of
the
federal
government
i’d
like
to
address
for
a
moment
and
refer
to
the
position
of
the
appellants,
the
heirs
regarding
the
case
of,
the
estate
of
anthone
belemechich
i
believe
is
pronounced,
the
heirs
i
believe
content
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
the
position
of
the
federal
government
there
as
opposed
to
the
position
here.
belemechich
case
was
one
concerned
with
the
pennsylvania
withholding
statute.
and
the
pennsylvania
court
found
that
the
treaty
of
1881
with
serbia
which
has
been
applied
by
this
court
to
the
country
of
yugoslavia
did
not
override
or
was
not
supreme
to
the
state
withholding
statute,
the
so
called
iron
curtain
rule.
now
the
position
as
i
understand
it
of
the
federal
government
in
that
case
was
merely
that
insofar
as
there
was
a
federal
treaty,
a
treaty
between
united
states
and
serbia
which
was
than
abide
as
being
valid
to
yugoslavia
that
this
was
an
overriding
policy
and
no
state
law
would
be
allowed
to
intervene.
the
position
of
the
federal
government
was
that
any
agreements
or
any
requirements
of
the
state
would
be
an
imposition
upon
that
treaty.
we
would
state
that
the
rule
of
clark
versus
allen
possesses
the
necessary
flexibility
to
continue
as
a
practical
and
applicable
principle
for
any
control
that
might
be
deemed
necessary
in
this
area.
or
in
the
event
that
the
federal
government
should
concluded
at
sometime
in
the
future
that
the
states
are
unduly
interfering
with
the
federal
government’s
right
to
regulate
foreign
affairs
and
foreign
relations
then
the
overriding
federal
policy
could
be
annunciated
and
implemented
whether
it
be
by
international
agreement
or
congressional
act
or
some
other
means.
referring
your
honor
to
article
4
of
the
treaty
excluding
personal
property
having
been
transferred
to
nonresident
aliens
is
that
correct,
to
german
aliens.
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
this
court
has
had
both
sides
presented
to
it
and
i
really
haven’t
taken
a
position,
i
don’t
feel
a
position
one
way
or
the
other.
on
interpreting
the
treaty
yes,
your
honor,
now
i
have
in
my
brief
and
will
speak
briefly
here
today
on
the
position
that
has
been
raised
by
the
federal
government
that
the
treaty
should
be
reinterpreted.
the
position
of
the
state
of
oregon
that
was
presented
to
the
courts
of
oregon
is
that
if
this
treaty
is
to
be
reinterpreted
such
reinterpretation
must
of
necessity
look
to
the
point
of
whether
the
1923
treaty
with
germany,
the
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce
and
consular
rights
is
existing
today.
we
would
contend
that
there
are
events
that
have
occurred
that
might
very
well
result
in
that
treaty
being
interpreted
as
having
been
terminated
by
the
ordinance.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
yes,
your
honor
however
as
this
court
stated
in
kolovrat
versus
oregon
regardless
of
the
fact
of
the
position
of
the
federal
government
and
the
agency
given
the
power
to
negotiate
and
implement
these
treaties
and
recognize
in
a
great
way
that
must
be
given
to
this
position
and
to
the
position
taken
by
the
government,
the
court
will
still
interpret
the
treaties
for
itself.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
no,
your
honor
i’m
not
reluctant
to
take
a
position
i
think
--
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
i
think
the
cases
have
settled
it
and
if
it
goes
the
other
way,
if
the
treaty
is
interpreted
as
by
this
court,
reinterpreted
as
applying
to
personal
property
as
well
as
real
property
in
article
4
of
1923
than
this
will
cover
this
case.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
no,
your
honor
i
have
--
the
court
did
not
consider
it,
neither
of
the
courts
in
oregon.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
that’s
correct
your
honor.
now
this
case
as
i
stated
was
substantially
in
fact
strikingly
similar
to
clark
versus
allen.
clark
versus
allen
was
sited
as
controlling
authority
in
almost
every
point
in
this
case
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
no,
your
honor
the
1937
statute
was
the
one
previously
referred
to
by
mr.
schwabe,
the
ocla
statute
61107
that
was
the
statute
in
oregon
in
1937.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
that
was
in
1937.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
we
are
not
dealing
with
that
statute
today
though
we
are
dealing
with
ors
111070
which
was
passed
in
1951.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
your
honor,
i’m
sorry
--
on
that
point,
couldn’t
say.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
as
far
as
aliens
are
concerned
yes,
your
honor.
aliens
had
a
right
--
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
absent
the
statute.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
i
believe
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
wouldn’t
make
a
certain
statement
but
i
believe
that
is
correct
because
in
oregon
as
in
many
states
we
had
an
alien
land
laws
and
we’re
concerned
with
these
in
several
cases
and
i
believe
that
the
situation
was
that
an
alien
could
not
inherit
or
could
not
in
some
cases
buy
real
property.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
i
believe
they
should
have
assumed
it
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
their
problem
was
person
had
located
elsewhere
or
the
possible
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
statement
in
the
treaty.
i
believe
this
is
where
much
of
this
arises
from.
i
think
this
particular
portion
of
article
4
relating
to
personal
property
can
be
interpreted
either
way
and
i
think
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
in
their
brief
for
the
united
states
amicus
curiae
points
this
out.
we
would
state
that
regarding
the
matter
of
the
overruling
or
modification
of
clark
versus
allen,
the
determination
there
possess
the
flexibility
necessary
to
allow
it
to
be
a
continuing
principle.
that
if
the
time
is
reached
when
the
government
feels
that
there
has
been
an
interference
with
foreign
affairs
then
the
overriding
federal
policy
may
be
enunciated.
now
that
point
hasn’t
been
reached
at
this
time
as
evidenced
by
the
statements
of
the
government.
we
would
further
contend
that
the
regrettable
disappointment
of
a
prospective
heir,
prospective
alien
heir
is
not
the
basis
for
limiting
or
removing
from
the
states,
the
right
to
regulate
or
control
a
succession
of
the
decedents'
estates
within
their
boundaries.
now
the
heirs,
the
appellants
seek
to
advance
the
active
state
doctrine
to
aid
their
position
in
this
matter.
however,
we
would
submit
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
no
applicability
here.
in
the
first
place
as
i
have
said
in
this
case
there
was
no
internal,
there
were
no
internal
acts
of
a
foreign
state
considered.
now
this
is
not
just
to
say
that
the
state
would
not
have
consider
such
acts,
i
would
not
deny
this.
they
would
have
considered
such
acts,
they
have
been
consider
before
another
cases
but
they
were
not
in
evidence
here
and
they
were
not
considered
here.
now
the
statement
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
as
was
set
forth
in
sabatino
case
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs
was
that
the
there
would
not
be
an
examination
of
the,
and
i
underscore
that
where
validity,
of
an
internal
act
of
a
recognized
foreign
sovereign
in
the
absence
of
an
agreed
legal
principle.
and
usually
this
relates
to
the
taking
of
property
within
that
foreign
country
but
we
have
two
aspects
missing
here,
first
we
don’t
have
a
recognized
sovereign.
the
united
states
doesn’t
recognize
east
germany,
german
democratic
republic.
secondly
and
more
importantly
we
are
not
concerned
in
these
cases
with
the
validity
of
an
internal
act
to
a
foreign
country.
we
are
concerned
with
this
act
but
not
with
the
validity
of
the
act.
the
consideration
of
such
acts
would
be
as
these
acts
would
bear
on
the
eligibility
of
the
individual,
we
would
not
be
concerned
with
the
effectiveness
of
the
acts,
the
foreign
acts
with
the
authoritativeness
or
with
the
enforceability
of
those
acts.
we
are
only
concerned
with
the
content
and
perhaps
the
effect
as
those
acts
would
reflect
on
the
eligibility
of
the
individual
perspective
heir.
now
with
regard
to
this
point
mr.
justice
reid
in
united
states
versus
burneson
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
made
the
comment
that
the
transfer
of
decedents'
properties
could
be
viewed
as
one
transaction
or
it
could
be
separable,
it
could
be
viewed
as
a
separate
or
as
a
series
of
separate
transactions,
and
that
the
states
in
regulating
the
succession
to
a
decedent’s
property
were
acting
upon
the
right
of
the
decedent
to
give
that
property,
not
upon
the
right
of
an
individual
or
the
united
states
or
anyone
else
to
take
the
property
or
receive
it.
they
were
acting
upon
their
right
of
the
decedent
to
give
it.
we
would
submit
that
here
this
is
what,
what
is
being
by
done
by
the
state.
granted,
we
still
recognize
the
possible
effect,
indirect
effect
in
foreign
countries,
but
here
the
state
is
saying
that
an
individual
may
not
give
property
to
a
non-resident
or
an
alien.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
your
honor
i
would
--
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
as
to
real
and
personal
property
unless
the
treaty
of
1923
with
germany
could
be
carried
into
effect
and
its
reciprocity
provisions
there,
with
the
non-recognition
of
east
germany,
i
don’t
see
how
anything
would
happen
except
that
the
property
would
remain
in
leipzig
and
that
the
-–
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
to
east
germany,
your
honor?
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
well
it
would
happen
under,
it
would
happen
under
east
german
law,
your
honor,
and
about
this,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record.
i
have
no
idea
what
the
aspect
of
east
german
law
would
be
in
this
case
or
russian
law
whichever
might
prevail
in
that
case.
the
law
of
the
german
democratic
republic,
i
have
no
knowledge
on
this
subject.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
the
record
has
no
bearing
here.
the
only
bearing
on
the
status
of
a
matter
in
east
germany
i
believe
was
testified
to
by
mr.
peckman,
dr.
peckman,
the
consul,
when
he
made
reference
in
the
probate
court
to
the
fact
that
in
some
instances
properties
in
west
germany,
assets
in
west
germany
are
i
believe
sometimes
held
there
for
the
benefit
of
those
in
east
germany,
sometimes
food
parcels
and
things
of
this
nature
are
transmitted.
but
other
than
this,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
regarding
east
german
laws
or
anything
of
this
nature.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
i
was
talking
of
west
germany,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
yes,
your
honor,
the
federal
republic
of
germany.
now
the
heirs
have
taken
the
position
that
the
statute
denies
the
rights
of
inheritance
of
the
foreign
heirs.
we
would
simply
state
this
that
except
for
the
laws
of
the
state
of
oregon,
the
heirs
have
no
rights
of
inheritance,
except
for
the
laws
of
the
state
of
oregon
and
any
international
agreement
that
may
supersede
or
be
supreme
above
those
laws
because
of
the
reflection
on
foreign
affairs.
now
i’d
like
for
a
moment
to
go
to
this
point
of
the
reconsideration
of
the
1923
treaty
as
was
proposed
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
brief
for
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae.
there
are
several
factors
that
i
believe
would
be
prerequisite
to
the
interpretation
of
this
treaty.
first
in
june
of
1953,
june
2nd,
there
was
a
note
from
the
united
states
to
the
government
of
the
federal
republic,
the
west
german
government,
terminating
article
6
of
the
treaty
as
is
provided
in
article
31
there,
it
provides
for
unilateral
termination
by
notice.
article
6
was
terminated
by
the
united
states
government
in
such
a
manner,
dealing
itself
with
the
federal
republic
as
the
other
treaty
party.
now
in
june
3,
1953,
the
two
same
governments,
the
united
states
government
and
the
government
of
the
federal
republic
of
germany
entered
into
an
agreement
relating
to
the
1923
treaty.
the
stated
purpose
of
that
agreement
was
to
restore
the
1923
treaty
to
full
force
and
effect
except
as
limited
within
the
agreement.
the
limitation
within
the
agreement
was
that
the
1923
treaty
should
be
limited
or
the
forcing
effect
of
the
1923
treaty
should
be
limited
to
the
territory
under
the
sovereignty
and
authority
of
the
federal
republic
of
germany,
west
germany.
it
also
made
provision
for
carrying
this
over
to
land
berlin
upon
such
time
as
the
political
situation
should
so
warrant.
in
1954,
the
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation
was
entered
into
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
federal
republic
of
germany.
this
was
in
response
to
negotiations
which
were
anticipated
in
the
1953
agreement.
now
in
the
1954
treaty,
article
26,
once
again,
limited
the
application
of
the
1954
treaty
to
the
territory
under
the
sovereignty
and
authority
of
the
federal
republic,
that
is
west
germany.
further
in
article
28
of
the
treaty,
there
was
specifically
and
expressly
several
articles
of
the
1923
treaty
were
terminated.
articles
1
through
5
were
terminated,
article
6
had
previously
been
terminated
unilaterally
by
the
united
states,
article
7
through
16
were
terminated,
and
articles
29
through
32.
the
only
articles
then
remaining
in
existence
by
the
–
under
the
agreement
of
--
or
i
should
say
under
the
treaty
of
1954
were
articles
17
through
28,
which
were
made
a
part
of
the
1954
treaty
until
such
time
as
a
consular
convention
should
be
arrived
at
between
the
two
parties.
now,
we
would
submit
that
all
of
these
facts
must
be
taken
into
consideration
and
wealth
could
provide
the
basis
for
determination
of
the
1923
treaty
has
been
in
fact
terminated
except
for
the
consular
conventions,
so
called,
that
it
no
longer
exists
including
article
4,
which
provides
reciprocity
and
which
clark
versus
allen
and
our
supreme
court
of
oregon
both
relied
on.
the
statements
and
position
of
the
federal
government
are
contrary,
and
we
recognize
this.
they
have
stated
that
the
1923
treaty
still
applies
as
to
east
germany
that
the
--
i
believe
their
position
is
not
misstated
when
i
say
that
they
have
held
that
the
1954
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
federal
republic,
at
that
time
the
federal
republic
had
no
authority,
no
jurisdiction,
no
sovereignty
over
east
germany
and
consequently
could
not
terminate
the
treaty
as
to
east
germany.
however
by
the
actions
and
negotiations
between
the
two
countries,
it
was
apparent
they
were
acting
as
one
treaty
party
with
another.
and
consequently
we
believe
the
basis
there
existed
for
finding
that
there
has
in
fact
been
a
termination.
would
you
not
deny
that
great
weight
is
to
be
given
to
the
position
to
the
federal
government,
however
as
i
stated
earlier
i
believe
the
position
of
the
court
has
been
that
even
notwithstanding
this
weight
it
will
interpret
the
treaties
for
itself.
i
would
say
that
we
would
urge
the
court
that
the
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
be
affirmed
unless
this
court
should
find
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
or
that
the
1923
treaty
has
been
terminated
in
which
case
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
would
have
to
be
modified.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there’s
one
fact
in
addition
to
those
that
mr.
schwabe’s
has
presented
before
the
court
that
i’d
like
to
mention
to
the
court
as
it
maybe
called
upon
to
bear
some
weight.
and
that
is
that
in
the
findings
in
order
of
the
probate
court
in
the
state
of
oregon
it
was
stated
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
make
a
finding
of
reciprocity
under
the
requirements
of
oregon
revised
statutes,
the
reciprocal
inheritance
right
statute
to
find
reciprocity
with
the
german
democratic
republic.
there
was
originally
no
evidence
on
this
basis.
the
only
testimony
was
that
of
dr
hess
kaufman
(ph)
who
was
the
counsel
for
the
northwestern
united
states
in
seattle
and
his
testimony
relates
almost
exclusively
to
the
construction
of
the
treaties,
the
authority
of
the
federal
republic
and
things
of
this
nature.
there
was
very
little
if
anything
that
could
be
directly
related
to
the
rights
or
to
the
laws
of
east
germany,
the
german
democratic
republic.
we
are
here
concerned
very
simply
stated
with
whether
the
oregon
revised
statute
11107,
the
reciprocal
inheritance
law
is
an
unconstitutional
invasion
of
the
federal
government's
right
to
govern
and
regulate
foreign
affairs
under
article
i,
section
8
and
10
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now
as
has
been
recognized
by
the
court,
this
brings
into
new
focus
again
the
case
of
clark
versus
allen.
we’re
here
concerned
with
only
one
of
the
questions
of
clark
versus
allen,
entered
upon
and
decided.
however,
the
two
cases
are
remarkably
similar.
once
again
we
have
german
nationals,
we
are
concerned
with
the
1923
treaty,
we
are
concerned
with
state
reciprocity
statutes,
we
are
concerned
with
similar
state
reciprocity
statute
here
oregon
and
california.
the
largest
differences
exist
between
the
fact
or
in
the
facts
that
germany
has
since
been
divided
and
we
do
not
recognize
the
east
germany
as
the,
under
a
form
of
government
which
is
i
should
say
we
do
not
recognize
it
is
having
a
sovereign
government,
we
recognize
the
occupation
of
soviet
russia.
another
difference
we
have,
the
new
treaty
of
1954,
the
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation
between
united
states
and
the
federal
republic.
finally,
we
have
the
guidepost
decision
of
clark
versus
allen
which
did
not
exist
at
that
time.
now,
the
position
of
the
state
of
oregon
is
that
this
court’s
decision
in
clark
versus
allen
was
a
determination
that
still
continued
in
its
validity
and
application
on
this
particular
question
that
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
reciprocal
inheritance
statute.
this
is
because
as
was
stated
in
that
case,
in
the
absence
of
a
conflicting
overriding
federal
policy
that
the
right
of
the
states
to
govern,
control,
and
regulate
the
disposition
or
succession
to
estates
within
their
territories
would
remain
in
the
states.
now
we
submit
that
here
there
is
no
overriding
of
federal
policy.
there
could
be
policy
if
any
can
be
said
to
exist
is
that
this
does
not
conflict
the
state
department
had
said
so
through
the
briefs
of
the
solicitor
general
upon
the
request
of,
which
is
provided
upon
the
request
of
the
court.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
was
saying
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
oregon
in
this
case
that
the
determination
in
clark
versus
allen
on
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
state
reciprocity
statutes
continues
to
be
a
valid
and
applicable
principle
that
though
the
state
acts
may
indirectly
affect
foreign
countries
and
as
is
the
state
reciprocity
statutes,
that
in
the
absence
of
a
conflicting
and
overriding
federal
policy
that
the
state
should
continue
to
be
allowed
to
regulate
the
succession
in
disposition
of
the
estates
within
the
boundaries
of
those
states.
now
here
we
have
no
conflicting
federal
policy.
in
fact
the
position
of
the
federal
government
has
been
made
clear
in
their
memorandum
brief
at
the
request
to
the
court.
in
answer
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
they
indicated
that
as
has
been
stated
here
that
such
acts
including
the
oregon
statute
have
had
little
effect.
further,
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
they
have
stated
that
the
government’s
position
is
no
way
or
they
do
not
contend
that
the
oregon
statute
constitutes
an
undue
interference
in
foreign
relations.
now,
regarding
this
position
of
the
federal
government
i’d
like
to
address
for
a
moment
and
refer
to
the
position
of
the
appellants,
the
heirs
regarding
the
case
of,
the
estate
of
anthone
belemechich
i
believe
is
pronounced,
the
heirs
i
believe
content
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
the
position
of
the
federal
government
there
as
opposed
to
the
position
here.
belemechich
case
was
one
concerned
with
the
pennsylvania
withholding
statute.
and
the
pennsylvania
court
found
that
the
treaty
of
1881
with
serbia
which
has
been
applied
by
this
court
to
the
country
of
yugoslavia
did
not
override
or
was
not
supreme
to
the
state
withholding
statute,
the
so
called
iron
curtain
rule.
now
the
position
as
i
understand
it
of
the
federal
government
in
that
case
was
merely
that
insofar
as
there
was
a
federal
treaty,
a
treaty
between
united
states
and
serbia
which
was
than
abide
as
being
valid
to
yugoslavia
that
this
was
an
overriding
policy
and
no
state
law
would
be
allowed
to
intervene.
the
position
of
the
federal
government
was
that
any
agreements
or
any
requirements
of
the
state
would
be
an
imposition
upon
that
treaty.
we
would
state
that
the
rule
of
clark
versus
allen
possesses
the
necessary
flexibility
to
continue
as
a
practical
and
applicable
principle
for
any
control
that
might
be
deemed
necessary
in
this
area.
or
in
the
event
that
the
federal
government
should
concluded
at
sometime
in
the
future
that
the
states
are
unduly
interfering
with
the
federal
government’s
right
to
regulate
foreign
affairs
and
foreign
relations
then
the
overriding
federal
policy
could
be
annunciated
and
implemented
whether
it
be
by
international
agreement
or
congressional
act
or
some
other
means.
referring
your
honor
to
article
4
of
the
treaty
excluding
personal
property
having
been
transferred
to
nonresident
aliens
is
that
correct,
to
german
aliens.
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
this
court
has
had
both
sides
presented
to
it
and
i
really
haven’t
taken
a
position,
i
don’t
feel
a
position
one
way
or
the
other.
on
interpreting
the
treaty
yes,
your
honor,
now
i
have
in
my
brief
and
will
speak
briefly
here
today
on
the
position
that
has
been
raised
by
the
federal
government
that
the
treaty
should
be
reinterpreted.
the
position
of
the
state
of
oregon
that
was
presented
to
the
courts
of
oregon
is
that
if
this
treaty
is
to
be
reinterpreted
such
reinterpretation
must
of
necessity
look
to
the
point
of
whether
the
1923
treaty
with
germany,
the
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce
and
consular
rights
is
existing
today.
we
would
contend
that
there
are
events
that
have
occurred
that
might
very
well
result
in
that
treaty
being
interpreted
as
having
been
terminated
by
the
ordinance.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
yes,
your
honor
however
as
this
court
stated
in
kolovrat
versus
oregon
regardless
of
the
fact
of
the
position
of
the
federal
government
and
the
agency
given
the
power
to
negotiate
and
implement
these
treaties
and
recognize
in
a
great
way
that
must
be
given
to
this
position
and
to
the
position
taken
by
the
government,
the
court
will
still
interpret
the
treaties
for
itself.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
no,
your
honor
i’m
not
reluctant
to
take
a
position
i
think
--
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
i
think
the
cases
have
settled
it
and
if
it
goes
the
other
way,
if
the
treaty
is
interpreted
as
by
this
court,
reinterpreted
as
applying
to
personal
property
as
well
as
real
property
in
article
4
of
1923
than
this
will
cover
this
case.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
no,
your
honor
i
have
--
the
court
did
not
consider
it,
neither
of
the
courts
in
oregon.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
that’s
correct
your
honor.
now
this
case
as
i
stated
was
substantially
in
fact
strikingly
similar
to
clark
versus
allen.
clark
versus
allen
was
sited
as
controlling
authority
in
almost
every
point
in
this
case
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
no,
your
honor
the
1937
statute
was
the
one
previously
referred
to
by
mr.
schwabe,
the
ocla
statute
61107
that
was
the
statute
in
oregon
in
1937.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
that
was
in
1937.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
we
are
not
dealing
with
that
statute
today
though
we
are
dealing
with
ors
111070
which
was
passed
in
1951.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
your
honor,
i’m
sorry
--
on
that
point,
couldn’t
say.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
as
far
as
aliens
are
concerned
yes,
your
honor.
aliens
had
a
right
--
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
absent
the
statute.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
i
believe
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
wouldn’t
make
a
certain
statement
but
i
believe
that
is
correct
because
in
oregon
as
in
many
states
we
had
an
alien
land
laws
and
we’re
concerned
with
these
in
several
cases
and
i
believe
that
the
situation
was
that
an
alien
could
not
inherit
or
could
not
in
some
cases
buy
real
property.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
i
believe
they
should
have
assumed
it
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
their
problem
was
person
had
located
elsewhere
or
the
possible
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
statement
in
the
treaty.
i
believe
this
is
where
much
of
this
arises
from.
i
think
this
particular
portion
of
article
4
relating
to
personal
property
can
be
interpreted
either
way
and
i
think
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
in
their
brief
for
the
united
states
amicus
curiae
points
this
out.
we
would
state
that
regarding
the
matter
of
the
overruling
or
modification
of
clark
versus
allen,
the
determination
there
possess
the
flexibility
necessary
to
allow
it
to
be
a
continuing
principle.
that
if
the
time
is
reached
when
the
government
feels
that
there
has
been
an
interference
with
foreign
affairs
then
the
overriding
federal
policy
may
be
enunciated.
now
that
point
hasn’t
been
reached
at
this
time
as
evidenced
by
the
statements
of
the
government.
we
would
further
contend
that
the
regrettable
disappointment
of
a
prospective
heir,
prospective
alien
heir
is
not
the
basis
for
limiting
or
removing
from
the
states,
the
right
to
regulate
or
control
a
succession
of
the
decedents'
estates
within
their
boundaries.
now
the
heirs,
the
appellants
seek
to
advance
the
active
state
doctrine
to
aid
their
position
in
this
matter.
however,
we
would
submit
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
no
applicability
here.
in
the
first
place
as
i
have
said
in
this
case
there
was
no
internal,
there
were
no
internal
acts
of
a
foreign
state
considered.
now
this
is
not
just
to
say
that
the
state
would
not
have
consider
such
acts,
i
would
not
deny
this.
they
would
have
considered
such
acts,
they
have
been
consider
before
another
cases
but
they
were
not
in
evidence
here
and
they
were
not
considered
here.
now
the
statement
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
as
was
set
forth
in
sabatino
case
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs
was
that
the
there
would
not
be
an
examination
of
the,
and
i
underscore
that
where
validity,
of
an
internal
act
of
a
recognized
foreign
sovereign
in
the
absence
of
an
agreed
legal
principle.
and
usually
this
relates
to
the
taking
of
property
within
that
foreign
country
but
we
have
two
aspects
missing
here,
first
we
don’t
have
a
recognized
sovereign.
the
united
states
doesn’t
recognize
east
germany,
german
democratic
republic.
secondly
and
more
importantly
we
are
not
concerned
in
these
cases
with
the
validity
of
an
internal
act
to
a
foreign
country.
we
are
concerned
with
this
act
but
not
with
the
validity
of
the
act.
the
consideration
of
such
acts
would
be
as
these
acts
would
bear
on
the
eligibility
of
the
individual,
we
would
not
be
concerned
with
the
effectiveness
of
the
acts,
the
foreign
acts
with
the
authoritativeness
or
with
the
enforceability
of
those
acts.
we
are
only
concerned
with
the
content
and
perhaps
the
effect
as
those
acts
would
reflect
on
the
eligibility
of
the
individual
perspective
heir.
now
with
regard
to
this
point
mr.
justice
reid
in
united
states
versus
burneson
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
made
the
comment
that
the
transfer
of
decedents'
properties
could
be
viewed
as
one
transaction
or
it
could
be
separable,
it
could
be
viewed
as
a
separate
or
as
a
series
of
separate
transactions,
and
that
the
states
in
regulating
the
succession
to
a
decedent’s
property
were
acting
upon
the
right
of
the
decedent
to
give
that
property,
not
upon
the
right
of
an
individual
or
the
united
states
or
anyone
else
to
take
the
property
or
receive
it.
they
were
acting
upon
their
right
of
the
decedent
to
give
it.
we
would
submit
that
here
this
is
what,
what
is
being
by
done
by
the
state.
granted,
we
still
recognize
the
possible
effect,
indirect
effect
in
foreign
countries,
but
here
the
state
is
saying
that
an
individual
may
not
give
property
to
a
non-resident
or
an
alien.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
your
honor
i
would
--
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
as
to
real
and
personal
property
unless
the
treaty
of
1923
with
germany
could
be
carried
into
effect
and
its
reciprocity
provisions
there,
with
the
non-recognition
of
east
germany,
i
don’t
see
how
anything
would
happen
except
that
the
property
would
remain
in
leipzig
and
that
the
-–
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
to
east
germany,
your
honor?
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
well
it
would
happen
under,
it
would
happen
under
east
german
law,
your
honor,
and
about
this,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record.
i
have
no
idea
what
the
aspect
of
east
german
law
would
be
in
this
case
or
russian
law
whichever
might
prevail
in
that
case.
the
law
of
the
german
democratic
republic,
i
have
no
knowledge
on
this
subject.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
the
record
has
no
bearing
here.
the
only
bearing
on
the
status
of
a
matter
in
east
germany
i
believe
was
testified
to
by
mr.
peckman,
dr.
peckman,
the
consul,
when
he
made
reference
in
the
probate
court
to
the
fact
that
in
some
instances
properties
in
west
germany,
assets
in
west
germany
are
i
believe
sometimes
held
there
for
the
benefit
of
those
in
east
germany,
sometimes
food
parcels
and
things
of
this
nature
are
transmitted.
but
other
than
this,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
regarding
east
german
laws
or
anything
of
this
nature.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
i
was
talking
of
west
germany,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
m.
thompson
yes,
your
honor,
the
federal
republic
of
germany.
now
the
heirs
have
taken
the
position
that
the
statute
denies
the
rights
of
inheritance
of
the
foreign
heirs.
we
would
simply
state
this
that
except
for
the
laws
of
the
state
of
oregon,
the
heirs
have
no
rights
of
inheritance,
except
for
the
laws
of
the
state
of
oregon
and
any
international
agreement
that
may
supersede
or
be
supreme
above
those
laws
because
of
the
reflection
on
foreign
affairs.
now
i’d
like
for
a
moment
to
go
to
this
point
of
the
reconsideration
of
the
1923
treaty
as
was
proposed
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
brief
for
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae.
there
are
several
factors
that
i
believe
would
be
prerequisite
to
the
interpretation
of
this
treaty.
first
in
june
of
1953,
june
2nd,
there
was
a
note
from
the
united
states
to
the
government
of
the
federal
republic,
the
west
german
government,
terminating
article
6
of
the
treaty
as
is
provided
in
article
31
there,
it
provides
for
unilateral
termination
by
notice.
article
6
was
terminated
by
the
united
states
government
in
such
a
manner,
dealing
itself
with
the
federal
republic
as
the
other
treaty
party.
now
in
june
3,
1953,
the
two
same
governments,
the
united
states
government
and
the
government
of
the
federal
republic
of
germany
entered
into
an
agreement
relating
to
the
1923
treaty.
the
stated
purpose
of
that
agreement
was
to
restore
the
1923
treaty
to
full
force
and
effect
except
as
limited
within
the
agreement.
the
limitation
within
the
agreement
was
that
the
1923
treaty
should
be
limited
or
the
forcing
effect
of
the
1923
treaty
should
be
limited
to
the
territory
under
the
sovereignty
and
authority
of
the
federal
republic
of
germany,
west
germany.
it
also
made
provision
for
carrying
this
over
to
land
berlin
upon
such
time
as
the
political
situation
should
so
warrant.
in
1954,
the
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation
was
entered
into
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
federal
republic
of
germany.
this
was
in
response
to
negotiations
which
were
anticipated
in
the
1953
agreement.
now
in
the
1954
treaty,
article
26,
once
again,
limited
the
application
of
the
1954
treaty
to
the
territory
under
the
sovereignty
and
authority
of
the
federal
republic,
that
is
west
germany.
further
in
article
28
of
the
treaty,
there
was
specifically
and
expressly
several
articles
of
the
1923
treaty
were
terminated.
articles
1
through
5
were
terminated,
article
6
had
previously
been
terminated
unilaterally
by
the
united
states,
article
7
through
16
were
terminated,
and
articles
29
through
32.
the
only
articles
then
remaining
in
existence
by
the
–
under
the
agreement
of
--
or
i
should
say
under
the
treaty
of
1954
were
articles
17
through
28,
which
were
made
a
part
of
the
1954
treaty
until
such
time
as
a
consular
convention
should
be
arrived
at
between
the
two
parties.
now,
we
would
submit
that
all
of
these
facts
must
be
taken
into
consideration
and
wealth
could
provide
the
basis
for
determination
of
the
1923
treaty
has
been
in
fact
terminated
except
for
the
consular
conventions,
so
called,
that
it
no
longer
exists
including
article
4,
which
provides
reciprocity
and
which
clark
versus
allen
and
our
supreme
court
of
oregon
both
relied
on.
the
statements
and
position
of
the
federal
government
are
contrary,
and
we
recognize
this.
they
have
stated
that
the
1923
treaty
still
applies
as
to
east
germany
that
the
--
i
believe
their
position
is
not
misstated
when
i
say
that
they
have
held
that
the
1954
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
federal
republic,
at
that
time
the
federal
republic
had
no
authority,
no
jurisdiction,
no
sovereignty
over
east
germany
and
consequently
could
not
terminate
the
treaty
as
to
east
germany.
however
by
the
actions
and
negotiations
between
the
two
countries,
it
was
apparent
they
were
acting
as
one
treaty
party
with
another.
and
consequently
we
believe
the
basis
there
existed
for
finding
that
there
has
in
fact
been
a
termination.
would
you
not
deny
that
great
weight
is
to
be
given
to
the
position
to
the
federal
government,
however
as
i
stated
earlier
i
believe
the
position
of
the
court
has
been
that
even
notwithstanding
this
weight
it
will
interpret
the
treaties
for
itself.
i
would
say
that
we
would
urge
the
court
that
the
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
be
affirmed
unless
this
court
should
find
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
or
that
the
1923
treaty
has
been
terminated
in
which
case
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
would
have
to
be
modified.
i
thank
the
court.
