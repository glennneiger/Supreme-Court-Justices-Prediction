justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
loose
on
all
this?
do
you
think
--
you
don’t
--
you
are
reluctant
to
take
a
decision
on
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
cases
have
settled
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
they
do
--
does
the
state
of
oregon
have
any
suggestion
as
the
why
the
people
of
that
treaty
would
limit
the
inheritability
of
personal
property
through
that
property
that
is
located
in
the,
in
another
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
rely
on
the
language,
you
say
your
language,
that’s
what
the
language
says
and
even
though
that
doesn’t
make
much
sense
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
what
the
common
law
rule
or
in
absent
of

or
in
the

what
was
the

the
before
–
this
1937

r.
white
when
was

justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
i
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
but
what

in
oregon
on
1937?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
absent,
wasn’t
the
old
rule,
the
absent
of
treaty,
absent
of
treaty
or
absent
of
statute
or
let
say
absent
of
statute
is
that
a
normal
state
rule
or
the
inheritability
of
personal
property
and
the
non-inheritability
of
real
estate,
isn’t
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
absent
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
absent
the
statute,
the
non-resident
alien
could
have
inherited
this
personally?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn’t
the
people
that
engrafted
a
treaty
assume
the
existence
of
the
inheritability
of
person
located
in
this
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yeah,
well
they
assumed
it
all
right
and
their
only
problem
was
that
person
is
located
elsewhere.
that’s
the
only
problem
they
addressed
themselves
to?
