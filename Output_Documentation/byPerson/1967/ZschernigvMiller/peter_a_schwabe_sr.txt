mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decree
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
oregon
as
cheating
the
estate
of
a
woman
by
the
name
the
pauline
schroeder
(ph).
under
an
oregon
reciprocity
and
inheritance
rights
statute
number
ors
111070,
the
trial
court
in
the
case
escheated
all
of
the
estate
in
the
state
of
oregon
on
a
finding
that
the
heirs
who
are
residents
of
the
russian
zone
of
occupation,
east
germany
were
not
eligible
to
inherit
under
the
reciprocity
and
inheritance
rights
statute.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
affirmed
escheat
of
the
personal
property
but
held
that
under
a
1923
treaty
which
i’ll
explain
in
just
a
moment
the
heirs
were
entitled
to
the
real
property.
the
facts
very
briefly
are
not
disputed
in
anyway.
this
woman
died
in
september
1962
in
portland,
oregon.
she
left
an
estate
of
approximately
$17,000
of
which
$4,500
was
a
small
home
that
she
had,
the
balance
was
cash
and
personal
property.
her
heirs,
she
died
intestate
were
brother
and
sister
and
number
of
nieces
and
nephews
in
leipzig
(ph)
in
the
russian
zone,
germany,
which
is
also
called
east
germany,
the
gdr,
deutsche
demokratische
republik,
german
democratic
republic
whatever
you
please.
under
our
concept
and
the
concept
of
the
united
states
government,
it
is
simply
an
occupied
portion
of
germany.
the
heirs
contended
that
they
were
entitled
to
inherit
the
whole
of
this
estate
under
the
article
9,
subsection
3
of
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
federal
republic
of
germany
in
1954,
which
provides
without
question
for
reciprocity
and
mutual
rights
of
inheritance.
they
claim
that
they
although
they
lived
in
the
russian
zone
of
germany,
nevertheless
they
were
german
citizens,
have
the
same
citizenship
as
german
national
and
therefore
they
had
the
benefits
of
that
treaty.
the
state
came
back
into
the
trial
the
case,
produced
a
letter
by
the
state
department
to
the
attorney
general
of
oregon,
saying
that
no
the
1950
treaty
did
not
have
territorial
application
to
the
east
zone
or
the
russian
zone
of
germany.
in
their
opinion
they
thought
the
1923
treaty
might
have
application.
the
1923
treaty
has
been
heretofore
construed
by
this
court
in
clark
versus
allen
handed
down
in
1947
in
which
the
court
held
that
under
article
4
of
1923
treaty
there
were
rights
of
inheritance
guaranteed
in
respect
of
real
property,
but
under
the
language
of
the
treaty
that
such
rights
were
not
guaranteed
in
respect
of
personal
property.
the
heirs
also
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
reciprocity
inheritance
rights
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
unlawful
invasion
by
the
state
of
oregon
by
an
individual
state
into
the
exclusive
power
of
the
federal
government
to
regulate
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
the
court
in
respect
to
that
simply
said
in
very
few
words,
this
argument
was
put
to
bed
by
clark
versus
allen.
the
rulings
of
the
lower
court,
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
respect
to
the
treaties
was
not
appealed
here,
but
we
have
appealed
on
the
constitutional
ground
because
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
statute
does
constitute
as
i
have
said
an
unlawful
intrusion
by
an
individual
state
on
the
exclusive
federal
power
to
regulate
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states,
and
that
is
we
feel
a
very
grave
and
a
very
serious
issue.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
your
honor
read
that
correctly.
the
state
department
in
the
solicitor
general’s
brief,
the
state
department
where
he
said,
that
the
state
department
had
found
that
it
had
very
little
effect
on
the
management
of
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
they
did
say
that,
but
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
i
claim
your
honor
that
whether
it
has
actually
to
this
point,
if
you
can
put
your
finger
on
whether
it
has
adversely
affected
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
with
the
affected
government,
i
am
speaking
now
primarily
of
the
iron
curtain
countries
because
this
is
a
iron
curtain
country
case,
i
will
point
out
that
our
contention
is
that
even
though
you
may
not
have
a
demonstrable
effect,
you
may
not
be
able
to
pinpoint
that
alright
we’ve
had
trouble
with
the
soviet
union
because
of
the
(inaudible)
case
in
1961,
but
this
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is,
does
it
have
a
potential,
does
it
have
a
--
is
it
an
actual
interference
with
the
exclusive
power
of
the
federal
government,
does
that
answer
your
question
sir?
now
then
the
fundamental
issue
here
is
this.
can
any
individual
state
imposed
by
statute,
conditions
upon
the
rights
of
inheritance
of
nonresident
aliens
within
that
state.
now
it's
been
held
and
we
do
not
contend
here
that
a
state
may
not
pass
laws
prohibiting
all
aliens
or
nonresident
aliens
from
inheritance,
but
we
are
presented
here
with
the
case
where
the
state
of
the
oregon
in
its
statute
ors
111070,
which
we
are
attacking
here,
lays
down
three
requirements.
they
say
number
one,
you’ve
got
to,
the
foreign
government
must,
a
foreign
country
must
allow
american
citizens
the
same
rights
of
inheritance
that
they
allow
their
own
citizens.
in
another
words
there
must
no
discrimination
as
to
the
inheritance
rights
of
the
american
citizens
within
that
country.
number
two,
they
require
that
the
american
citizen
must
have
immediate
unconditional
right
to
the
payment
of
these
inheritances
from
the
foreign
country.
now
i’ll
demonstrate
to
your
honors
in
just
a
moment
by
oregon
decision,
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
construed
that
requirement
to
mean
that
unless
an
american
citizen
can
say
i
want
my
money
in
american
dollars
right
now
unconditionally,
immediately
then,
and
they
don’t
give
it
because
the
country
has
foreign
exchange
control
regulations,
which
every
county
has
including
our
own,
that
then
the
right
to
take,
the
right
to
inherit
is
destroyed
because
the
right
to
receive
and
to
receive
immediately
not
conditionally
and
not
tomorrow,
the
next
day
but
today
that
destroys
the
right
to
inherit
and
this
is
been
the
holding
of
the
california
supreme
court,
its
been
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
oregon
repeatedly.
on
top
of
that,
i’d
like
to
say
here
for
just
a
moment,
that
these
two
requirements
of
the
statute
are
almost
identical
with
the
statute
as
it
was
at
the
time
clark
versus
allen
was
decided
and
the
date
of
that
case
was
1942,
those
two
requirements;
the
no
discrimination
and
the
right
to
immediate
payment
of
an
inheritance
were
in
the
california
statute.
now
oregon
in
1951
when
they
adapted
this
statute
with
which
we
are
concerned
put
in
another
requirement.
they
said
that
the
alien,
nonresident
alien
must
have
the
free
use
benefit
and
control
of
his
money
without
confiscation
by
his
government
in
whole
or
in
part.
now
this
is
a
partial
adaptation
of
the,
what
we
call
eastern
statutes,
which
are
recording
statute,
new
york
has
it
in
269(a)
of
the
new
york
circuits
court
act,
massachusetts
has
it,
pennsylvania
has
it,
new
jersey
has
it.
in
those
states,
by
statute
the
surrogate's
probate
judges
may
order
actual
distribution
if
in
their
opinion
the
foreign
heir
is
not
going
to
get
the
full
enjoyment
of
these
inheritance
of
free
benefit
use
and
control.
this
was
the
forum,
i
would
say
this
269(a)
of
the
new
york
circuit
court
act
was
before
this
court
in
ioannou
versus
new
york
in
1962
in
which
the
court
declined
to
take
jurisdiction
because
it
felt
there
were
no
substantial
federal
question.
however
mr.
justice
douglas
joined
by
mr.
justice
black
filed
a
dissent
in
which
they
said
that
they
felt
that
it
was
time
to
reexamine
clark
versus
allen,
that
this
issue
was
not
foreclosed
by
clark
versus
allen.
so,
then
as
i
say
on
the
top
of
pre-use
benefit
and
control
they
imposed
this
that
the
foreign
country
may
not
partially
or
wholly
confiscate
the
right
of
inheritance
or
the
inheritance
of
the
foreign
heir
coming
from
the
state
of
oregon.
now
obviously
no
foreign
country
is
ever
going
to
admit
or
say
or
confess
that
they
are
confiscating
anything
much
less
an
inheritance
coming
from
an
estate
from
the
state
of
oregon
to
them.
how
you
can
prove
that,
that
they
do
or
don’t
is
something
that
i
think
no
one
can
answer.
however,
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
found
it
very,
very
convenient
answer
to
that.
it
came
out
the
estate
of
pikaicho
(ph),
these
are
cited
in
my
brief,
a
czechoslovak,
a
man
who
was
a
resident
of
czechoslovakia,
citizen
of
czechoslovakia,
domiciliary
of
czechoslovakia
had
come
over
before
the
first
war,
had
gone
back
shortly
after
the
end
of
the
first
war,
had
a
family
there,
he
left
a
bank
account
in
portland.
and
he
lived
and
there
was
no
question
about
him
being
a
domiciliary,
he
died
some
eight
or
ten
years
after
he
had
returned
home,
he
left
his
bank
account.
in
that
case
involving
czechoslovakia,
the
court
escheated
it,
disregarded
the
rule
that
the
law
of
the
domicile
of
decedent
governs
the
succession
of
personal
property,
ignored
that
or
refused
to
adopt
it
that
way
and
escheated
the
estate.
and
they
decided
it
on
this
third
ground
which
i
just
mentioned
by
simply
saying
that
czechoslovakia
is
on
the
list
of
the
treasury
department
circular
655,
which
is
a
circular
issued
under
a
federal
regulation
that
no
checks
of
united
states,
well
the
united
states
treasury
maybe
sent
to
that
country.
and
as
a
result
of
that
no
social
security
checks,
no
veteran
checks,
no
subject
of
that
kind
go
to
these
countries.
they
are,
they’re
what
you
might
say
the
communist
led
countries,
red
china,
the
north
korea,
north
vietnam
and
so
forth,
soviet
union
is
also
on
it
and
czechoslovakia
also
was
at
that
time
and
still
is
i
would
say.
but
anyway
they
said
that
the
very
fact
that
czechoslovakia
was
on
that
treasury
department
list
of
countries
that
in
itself
was
evidence
that
that
was
at
least
partial
confiscation
by
the
government
of
czechoslovakia
of
the
inheritances
of
these
people
and
therefore
on
basis
of
that
they
escheated
the
estate.
now
as
i
said
again
the
fundamental
question
is
may
any
state
of
the
union
lay
down
its
own
conditions
and
say
to
the
foreign
country
if
you
don’t
confirm
your
inheritance
laws
to
ours
your
people
can’t
inherit.
if
you
do
not
allow
american
citizens
immediate
payment
disregard
your
foreign
exchange
control
or
disregard
any
internal
laws
that
you
may
have
to
govern
your
foreign
--
supply,
if
you
withhold
that
money
for,
even
in
instance
if
he
can’t
have
it
on
demand
that
then
there
the
prosecution
fails
and
we
will
began
to
confiscate
your
people’s
inheritance.
on
the
third
requirement
they
say
if
you
don’t
give
these
people
the
free
use
benefit
and
control
of
the
money
whatever
these
words
mean,
they
can
mean
almost
anything,
but
they
say
if
you
don’t
give
them
the
free
use
benefit
and
control
of
that
money
and
if
you
confiscate
any
portion
of
it
then
we
again
will
not
allow
you
to
inherit.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
there
are
about
10
statutes,
they
are
listed
in
my
brief,
the
states
with
which
we
are
primarily
concerned
here,
and
i’ll
say
again
oregon
is
the
most
let’s
say
brutal
statute,
the
most
demanding
statute
because
they
not
only
require
reciprocity
of
inheritance,
they
not
only
require
the
immediate
right
of
payment
but
they
have
this
free
use
benefit
control
without
confiscation.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
california’s
is
also
an
escheat
statute
but
each
of
them
california,
oregon,
iowa,
nebraska,
north
carolina
have
provisions
whereby
if
the
non-resident
alien
do
not
inherit
they
escheat
only
if
there
is
no
eligible
heir,
if
there
is
no
other
heir
living
outside
the
country,
for
instance
if
he
has
an
relative
in
great
britain
or
if
he
had
a
relative
in
this
country,
in
canada,
australia,
wherever
it
is.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
there
is
no
escheat
provision
in
the
new
york
statute.
there
is
no
escheat
provision
in
any
of
the
eastern
states.
i
am
speaking
of
massachusetts,
pennsylvania,
new
jersey
and
so
forth.
oregon,
california,
now
montana
has
a
particularly
strong
escheat
statute
in
this
respect
that
in
oregon,
in
california,
in
iowa,
nebraska
they
will
allow
an
eligible
heir
to
take.
however,
in
-–
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
no
--
yes
oregon
will
too,
but
in
montana
the
share
of
the
ineligible
heir
escheat.
for
instance
in
oregon
if
he
has
a
brother
in
portland
and
if
he
has
a
brother
in
let's
say
czechoslovakia
or
east
germany
then
the
brother
in
portland
will
get
the
whole
estate,
but
in
montana,
montana
will
escheat
the
half
interest
of
the
brother
who
in
ineligible
if
the
brother
in
this
country
for
instance
the
eligible
heir
take
it
off.
now
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
lies
of
course
in
the
fact
that
in
the
entire
concept
of
these
statutes
is
to
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
force
a
foreign
government
to
confirm
its
laws
and
its
rights
of
inheritance
and
monetary
policies
and
so
forth
to
those
of
state
of
oregon.
i
like
to
read
to
you
if
i
may
the
declaration
of
purpose
as
stated
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
claston
versus
schmidt
quoted
on
page
15
of
my
brief.
they
say
here
the
purpose
of
61107
which
is
the
immediate
predecessor
of
this
statute
is
clear
and
beyond
doubt.
it
was
enacted
to
assure
receipt
for
rights
of
inheritance
to
american
citizens
and
alien
residents
or
citizens.
it
was
in
a
sense
an
inducement
to
foreign
nations
to
so
frame
the
inheritance
laws
of
their
respective
countries
in
a
manner
which
would
ensure
to
oregonians
the
same
opportunities
to
inherit
and
to
take
personal
property
abroad
that
they
enjoy
in
the
state
of
oregon.
now
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
in
the
ioannou
case
pointed
out
that
if
the
new
york
statute
was
intended
to
prevent
a
foreign
country
from
getting
american
funds
then
there
was
a
serious
question
if
it
was
not
an
attempt
to
regulate
the
foreign
relationships
of
united
states
and
that
i
think
is
exactly
the
point
that
i
am
making
here
on
the
unconstitutionality.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
no
sir
it
does
not.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
for
the
reason
your
honor
i
personally
and
i
was
the
one
of
course
who,
to
a
large
extent
recommended
the
ground
to
appeal
here
was
the
fact
that
i
think
that
this
court,
mr.
justice
douglas
was
right
in
his
interpretation
although
it
was
a
strict
interpretation
of
article
4
of
the
treaty
of
1923
in
clark
versus
allen.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
on
the
government’s
basis
we
might
have
to
and
secondarily
also
not
only
that
but
we
think
that
clark
versus
allen
has
been
overcome
by
the
developments
of
the
last
20
years
between
1947
and
1967.
since
that
time
all
of
these
decisions
have
come
down
as
vast
amount
of
litigations
has
gone
through
the
courts.
we
have
had
the
situation
in
california
where
in
1961
the,
a
substantial
estate
was
taken
away
from
the
russian
heirs
on
12
reporting
page
analysis
of
the
government
of
the
soviet
union
of
their
ideology,
their
constitution.
there
were
charges
there
that
had
secret
laws
and
laws
that
although
they
were
on
the
books
weren’t
enforced
and
so
forth.
it
was
a
long,
long
opinion
and
on
basis
of
that
it
was
held
that
the
russian
heirs
had
no
right
to
inherit
that
estate.
now
in
1966
in
latin
versus
terry,
just
recently
the
california
supreme
court
ruled
for
reciprocity
with
the
soviet
union
and
held
that
all
this
logic
that
we
recited,
i
should
say
the
district
court
of
appeal,
not
the
supreme
court
recited,
was
wrong.
that
if
we
were
do
the
very
thing
that
they
did
in
(inaudible)
take
the
soviet
judicial
system,
the
soviet
legal
system,
those
foreign
funds
control
the
whole
things
take
it
apart,
the
minute
we
do
that
we
are
interfering
and
risking
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
and
this
is
exactly
what
we
contend
here
that
when
the
courts
of
estate
must
take
a
foreign
country's
laws,
it’s
constitution,
it’s
ideology,
its
judicial
system
apart
and
say
well
yes
but
we
don’t
think
that
you
do
allow
american
citizens
the
right
to
inherit.
yes
you
have
foreign
exchange
control
laws,
but
under
those
laws
you
don’t
give
our
american
citizens
immediate
right
to
inherit,
therefore
you
have
lost
your
right
of
inheritance.
when
they
try
to
take
it
apart
and
say
well
you
are
actually
confiscating
the
inheritances
coming
out
of
oregon
possibly
by
an
unrealistic
rate
of
exchange
by
any
number
of
articles
is
that
that
it
might
be
accused
of
using,
that
the
state
is
definitely
invading
the
field
of
the
federal
government.
now
it
is
said
and
i
there
is
myself
mr.
justice
fortas
and
as
of
your
question,
you
say
the
state
department
say,
well
this
hasn’t
--
has
that
little
effect.
they
didn’t
say
no
effect
they
said
this
had
little
effect
on
the
conduct
of
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
i
say
that
again
that
that
is
not
the
test
of
constitutionality.
it’s
the
potential
and
it’s
the
possibility.
now,
to
this
point
only
10
states
of
the
united
states
have
reciprocal
inheritance
right
statute
and
they
are
listed
in
my
brief
and
with
the
confiscatory
provisions
that
if
these
conditions
are
not
met
then
we
can’t
escheat.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
suggested
that
in
his
brief
that
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
1954
treaty
applied
to
residents
of
the
russian
occupied
zone
of
germany
or
if
the
court
were
now
to
say
that
article
iv
of
the
1923
treaty
does
provide
for
reciprocal
rights
of
inheritance
in
respect
to
personal
property
then
there
would
be,
i
would
say
that
the
court
could
duck
the
issue
of
constitutionality.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
yes,
that’s
substantially
so
not,
the
only
the
part
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
oh
yes,
yes,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
but
what
we
say
about
clark
versus
allen,
the
part
of
that
clark
versus
allen
which
rejected
the,
let
me
remind
you
this
was
the
argument
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
that
the
california
statute
which
is
almost
what
the
same
is
the
oregon
statute
now
that
that
invaded
the
foreign
relations
field
of
the
federal
government
that
is
--
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
in
respect
to
that
california
statute
which
is
almost
what
is
the
oregon
statute
said
that
it
was
not
a
statute
of
inheritance
it
was
a
statute
of
confiscation
and
retaliation.
and
the
attorney
general
in
clark
versus
allen
case
said
in
his
brief
that
the
statute
has
already
been
a
recurrent
source
of
friction
in
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
said
that.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
unfortunately
not.
however,
i
still
say
that
that
is
not
the
test.
if
you
can
--
the
fact
that
you
can't
demonstrate
that
a
case
such
as
the
russian
case
which
i
just
told
you,
now
we
had
one
case
in
california
where
the
california
supreme
court
denied
reciprocity
with
yugoslavia
in
san
francisco
on
identically
the
same
case,
identically
the
same
witnesses
including
the
ambassador
of
yugoslavia,
the
los
angeles
case
held
against
reciprocity,
held
with
for
reciprocity
in
the
san
francisco
court
held
against
reciprocity
and
the
california
supreme
court
sustained
it.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
we
contented
sir
that
the
1954
treaty
governs
that
these
people
and
there
was
an
evidence
of
certificate
by
the
foreign
office
of
the
government
in
bonn
to
the
effect
that
the
people
in
the
russian
zone
of
germany
have
the
same
citizenship
exactly
as
the
citizens
and
the
residents
of
the
federal
republic,
and
that
therefore
they
were
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
1954
treaty
however,
the
state
department
took
a
contrary
position.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
no
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
we’ve
recognized
bonn
as
the
only
legitimate
government
for
the
entire
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
yes
sir,
there
is.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
1954
treaty
that
its
territorial
application
shall
be
to
the
territory
over
which
the
federal
republic
exercises
sovereignty.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
excluding
the
russian
zone,
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
and
in
the
letter
to
the
state
--
by
the
state
department
to
the
attorney
general
of
oregon
and
also
in
their
publication,
the
state
department
publishes
a
guidance
but
--
they
say
it
does
not
apply
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
court
please.
i
would
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white
on
the
policy
or
the
law
of
the
state
of
oregon
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
reciprocity
statute.
i
think
i
can
correctly
and
definitively
inform,
your
honor,
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
reciprocity
statute,
the
first
one
in
1937,
there
was
never
any
question
about
the
right
of
inheritance
of
any
non-resident
alien
real
or
personal
property.
we
did
of
course
years
ago
had
alien
land
laws
which
were
set
aside
by
assertive
decisions
of
this
court
which
prevented
aliens
not
eligible
for
citizenship
to
owning
their
property
in
california
or
even
washington,
there’s
a
series
of
cases
on
there.
but
prior
to
1937,
there
was
no
restriction
whatsoever
in
respect
to
either
real
or
personal
property
of
non-resident
aliens
regardless
of
where
they
resided.
of
course
in
1937
the
political
situation
in
the
world
was
quite
different,
prior
to
the
war
and
the
upheaval
since
that
time
did
not
exist.
so
it
does
affect,
the
reciprocal
inheritance
rights
statute
did
for
the
first
affect
the
right,
inheritance
rights
of
any
non-resident
aliens.
now
speaking
of
the
termination
of
the
1923
treaty,
i’d
like
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
number
1
to
the
fact
that
we
appealed
only
on
the
constitutionality
question.
we
did
not
appeal
on
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty,
although
the
attorney
general
of
oregon
has,
by
his
brief
and
by
his
argument
today
sought
to
interject
that
issue.
we
say
to
your
honor
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
he
says
that
the
west,
by
correspondence
and
dealing
with
the
west
german
government,
the
bonn
government
and
the
united
states
government,
the
1923
treaty
has
been
rescinded
and
advocated
terminated,
but
he
doesn’t
--
in
the
same
communication
in
which
the
state
department
said
that
the
1923
treaty
still
applies
to
the
russian
zone
of
occupation
and
that
same
--
in
that
same
communication
they
said
the
1954
treaty
does
not
apply
and
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
you
can't
say
that
the
bonn
government
can
terminate
the
1923
treaty
in
respect
to
the
russian
zone
and
--
but
that
they
can't
say
that
the
1954
treaty
extends
to
our
citizens,
our
nationals
in
the
russian
zone.
and
that
carries
me
to
next
point.
it
has
been
said
here
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
reciprocity.
mind
you
reciprocity
can
be
proven
either
by
treaty
or
by
reciprocity,
the
fact
that
you
go
into
the
laws
of
the
country,
inheritance
laws,
the
property
change
control
laws,
you
produce
mountains
of
decrees
by
probate
courts
of
the
foreign
countries,
you
produce
lists
of
remittances,
you
produce
the
battle
of
the
experts,
you
get
one
set
of
experts
that
say
that
there
was
reciprocity
and
the
next
set
of
experts
says
no
and
the
question
as
i
think
professor
shatkin
pointed
out
in
his
article
it's
the
person
who
can
hire
the
most
expert
and
the
most
expensive
experts
is
the
person
that
usually
wins.
but
the
point
is
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
reciprocity
in
this
record
for
the
simple
reason
that
from
the
inception
of
this
case,
the
east
german
people
took
the
position
that
they
were
governed
by
german
law,
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
german
--
the
benefit
of
the
german
treaty
of
1954.
the
foreign
office
of
the
federal
republic
took
that
position
on
a
special
document
which
is
in
evidence
here,
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief
and,
they
said
those
people
have
the
same
nationality
as
the
residents
of
the
federal
republic
therefore
they
are
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
1954
treaty
as
it
applies
to
inheritance
rights,
having
in
mind
that
there
is
differentiation
if
the
court
please
between
territorial
application
of
the
treaty
and
the
personal
rights
granted
by
a
treaty.
the
personal
rights
granted
by
a
treaty
are
given
to
nationals
of
that
country,
not
that
the
nationals
have
to
reside
within
the
borders
of
that
country.
they
can
be
residing
in
australia,
in
timbuktu,
in
alaska,
any
place
in
the
world
but
every
german
is
bound
by
that
treaty
if
he
is
a
german
national
and
that
is
the
position
that
we
took
that
these
people
granted
that
they
were
residing
east
of
the
border,
granted
that
they
are
residing
east
of
the
wall,
but
they're
still
germans,
they
are
governed
by
german
law
and
they're
entitled
to
german
treaty,
that’s
the
position
we
took
and
it’s
quite
impossible
under
those
circumstances
if
you
take
that
position
to
say
we’re
going
to
bring
in
evidence
of
reciprocity
for
a
country
that
doesn’t
exist.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
yes
your
honor,
because
we
did
not
appeal
on
that
subject
and
it
think
i
gave
your
honor
the
reason
for
that.
i
don’t
say
that
if
this
court
rejects
our
argument
on
the
constitutionality
that
we
would
not
welcome
the
1950
--
the
1923
treaty
being
re-construed
to
include
personal
property,
but
that’s
not
our
position
here.
we
did
not
appeal
on
that
ground
and
we
don’t
ask
the
court
to
do
that
here,
i
don’t
think
we
can.
by
the
same
token
i
don’t
think
that
the
distinct
not
having
cross
appealed
on
the
oregon
supreme
court’s
finding
that
the
1923
treaty
applies,
i
don’t
think
the
state
cannot
come
and
say
that
the
treaty
was
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
are
you
speaking
of
the
attorney
general
of
oregon
or
the
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
we
take
the
position
your
honor
that
we
did
not
respond
to
his
brief
for
the
reason
that,
that
was
brought
in
on
his
own
volition.
he
is
the
one
that
asked
the
court
to
re-construe
and
reexamine
it’s
construction
of
the
1923
treaty
in
clark
versus
allen.
we
did
not
ask
that.
he
brought
that
in
and
we
felt
that
having
appealed
solely
on
the
constitutional
issue
that
it
was
not
up
to
us
to
argue
that
point.
i
would
like
to
just
in
conclusion
i
think
would
just
like
to
say
that
i
pointed
our
earlier
that
are
now
ten
states
of
the
union
that
would
have
these
reciprocity
statues.
there
are
great
many
cases
in
california,
in
oregon,
in
montana,
other
reciprocity
states
being
held
in
abeyance
waiting
for
this
court
to
decide
on
the
constitutionality
of
these
reciprocity
inherent
right
statue.
i
will
say
this,
if
the
court
does
place
the
stamp
of
approval
of
constitutionality
on
the
oregon
statue
and
by
doing
that
on
the
rest
of
the
statues
these
are
certainly
going
to
proliferate
and
although
the
state
department
may
say
no
that
at
this
point
there
has
been
no
--
there
has
been
only
little
effect
on
the
foreign
relations
of
united
states
i
can
visualize
a
very
grave
serious
situation
developing
in
later
years
and
in
the
future
if
these
statutes
are
held
to
be
constitutional
and
thereby
i
ask
that
the
courts
rule
to
be
unconstitutional.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
that
is
what
the
state
department
should
say.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
no
it’s
just
a
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
federal
republic
of
germany.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
the
united
states
has
a
number
of
treaties
with
foreign
countries,
which
for
instance
there
is
an
1852
treaty
with
argentina
which
is
frequently
cited
in
these
cases,
because
for
instance
with
yugoslavia
there
was
the
mutual
most
favored
nation
clause
in
the
yugoslavia
treaty
of
1881
and
the
serbian
treaty
and
it
was
held
--
it
was
argued
and
also
inferentially
held
that
the
most
favored
nation
provision
of
the
serbian
treaty,
the
argentine
treaty
applied.
the
swiss
have
a
treaty,
the
french
have
a
treaty,
the
british
have
a
treaty
and
nobody
ever
questions
reciprocity
with
any
of
the
western
countries.
it’s
an
iron
curtain
rule,
the
only
countries
against
which
the
reciprocity
statues
have
ever
been
asserted
and
they’ve
gone
to
any
higher
court
is
in
respect
to
the
iron
curtain
country.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
the
same
constitutional
provisions
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
with
your
concurrence
with
mr.
justice
black,
ruled
that
whenever
a
state
inheritance
law
effects
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
interferes
in
anyway
with
the
foreign
relations
of
the
of
the
united
states
then
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
exclusive
federal
power
to
govern
foreign
relations,
which
in
essence
is
based
on
article
1
section
10
of
constitution,
which
is
generally
cited.
there
is
also
at
times
is
recited
a
commerce
clause
and
the
due
process
clause.
but
basically
our
appeal
has
been
on
article
16
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
i'm
very
sorry
sir,
i
do
not
follow
your
question.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
yes
sir
and
that
any
incursion
by
any
state
upon
the
field
of
foreign
relations
in
any
of
its
domestic
legislation
is
unconstitutional.
it
may
not
given
effect
and
that
i
think
is
the
--
also
in
clark
versus
allen
that
very
statement
was
made
that
while
traditionally
rights
of
inheritance
are
within
the
province
of
the
individual
state,
when
the
legislation
in
respect
to
inheritance
does
crossover
into
the
field
of
foreign
relations
affecting
the
relations
of
the
united
states
with
a
foreign
country
that
then
it
becomes
an
unconstitutional
and
an
unauthorized
invasion
by
the
state
with
the
exclusive
federal
part
of
government
to
foreign
relations.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decree
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
oregon
as
cheating
the
estate
of
a
woman
by
the
name
the
pauline
schroeder
(ph).
under
an
oregon
reciprocity
and
inheritance
rights
statute
number
ors
111070,
the
trial
court
in
the
case
escheated
all
of
the
estate
in
the
state
of
oregon
on
a
finding
that
the
heirs
who
are
residents
of
the
russian
zone
of
occupation,
east
germany
were
not
eligible
to
inherit
under
the
reciprocity
and
inheritance
rights
statute.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
affirmed
escheat
of
the
personal
property
but
held
that
under
a
1923
treaty
which
i’ll
explain
in
just
a
moment
the
heirs
were
entitled
to
the
real
property.
the
facts
very
briefly
are
not
disputed
in
anyway.
this
woman
died
in
september
1962
in
portland,
oregon.
she
left
an
estate
of
approximately
$17,000
of
which
$4,500
was
a
small
home
that
she
had,
the
balance
was
cash
and
personal
property.
her
heirs,
she
died
intestate
were
brother
and
sister
and
number
of
nieces
and
nephews
in
leipzig
(ph)
in
the
russian
zone,
germany,
which
is
also
called
east
germany,
the
gdr,
deutsche
demokratische
republik,
german
democratic
republic
whatever
you
please.
under
our
concept
and
the
concept
of
the
united
states
government,
it
is
simply
an
occupied
portion
of
germany.
the
heirs
contended
that
they
were
entitled
to
inherit
the
whole
of
this
estate
under
the
article
9,
subsection
3
of
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
federal
republic
of
germany
in
1954,
which
provides
without
question
for
reciprocity
and
mutual
rights
of
inheritance.
they
claim
that
they
although
they
lived
in
the
russian
zone
of
germany,
nevertheless
they
were
german
citizens,
have
the
same
citizenship
as
german
national
and
therefore
they
had
the
benefits
of
that
treaty.
the
state
came
back
into
the
trial
the
case,
produced
a
letter
by
the
state
department
to
the
attorney
general
of
oregon,
saying
that
no
the
1950
treaty
did
not
have
territorial
application
to
the
east
zone
or
the
russian
zone
of
germany.
in
their
opinion
they
thought
the
1923
treaty
might
have
application.
the
1923
treaty
has
been
heretofore
construed
by
this
court
in
clark
versus
allen
handed
down
in
1947
in
which
the
court
held
that
under
article
4
of
1923
treaty
there
were
rights
of
inheritance
guaranteed
in
respect
of
real
property,
but
under
the
language
of
the
treaty
that
such
rights
were
not
guaranteed
in
respect
of
personal
property.
the
heirs
also
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
reciprocity
inheritance
rights
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
unlawful
invasion
by
the
state
of
oregon
by
an
individual
state
into
the
exclusive
power
of
the
federal
government
to
regulate
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
the
court
in
respect
to
that
simply
said
in
very
few
words,
this
argument
was
put
to
bed
by
clark
versus
allen.
the
rulings
of
the
lower
court,
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
respect
to
the
treaties
was
not
appealed
here,
but
we
have
appealed
on
the
constitutional
ground
because
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
statute
does
constitute
as
i
have
said
an
unlawful
intrusion
by
an
individual
state
on
the
exclusive
federal
power
to
regulate
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states,
and
that
is
we
feel
a
very
grave
and
a
very
serious
issue.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
your
honor
read
that
correctly.
the
state
department
in
the
solicitor
general’s
brief,
the
state
department
where
he
said,
that
the
state
department
had
found
that
it
had
very
little
effect
on
the
management
of
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
they
did
say
that,
but
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
i
claim
your
honor
that
whether
it
has
actually
to
this
point,
if
you
can
put
your
finger
on
whether
it
has
adversely
affected
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
with
the
affected
government,
i
am
speaking
now
primarily
of
the
iron
curtain
countries
because
this
is
a
iron
curtain
country
case,
i
will
point
out
that
our
contention
is
that
even
though
you
may
not
have
a
demonstrable
effect,
you
may
not
be
able
to
pinpoint
that
alright
we’ve
had
trouble
with
the
soviet
union
because
of
the
(inaudible)
case
in
1961,
but
this
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is,
does
it
have
a
potential,
does
it
have
a
--
is
it
an
actual
interference
with
the
exclusive
power
of
the
federal
government,
does
that
answer
your
question
sir?
now
then
the
fundamental
issue
here
is
this.
can
any
individual
state
imposed
by
statute,
conditions
upon
the
rights
of
inheritance
of
nonresident
aliens
within
that
state.
now
it's
been
held
and
we
do
not
contend
here
that
a
state
may
not
pass
laws
prohibiting
all
aliens
or
nonresident
aliens
from
inheritance,
but
we
are
presented
here
with
the
case
where
the
state
of
the
oregon
in
its
statute
ors
111070,
which
we
are
attacking
here,
lays
down
three
requirements.
they
say
number
one,
you’ve
got
to,
the
foreign
government
must,
a
foreign
country
must
allow
american
citizens
the
same
rights
of
inheritance
that
they
allow
their
own
citizens.
in
another
words
there
must
no
discrimination
as
to
the
inheritance
rights
of
the
american
citizens
within
that
country.
number
two,
they
require
that
the
american
citizen
must
have
immediate
unconditional
right
to
the
payment
of
these
inheritances
from
the
foreign
country.
now
i’ll
demonstrate
to
your
honors
in
just
a
moment
by
oregon
decision,
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
construed
that
requirement
to
mean
that
unless
an
american
citizen
can
say
i
want
my
money
in
american
dollars
right
now
unconditionally,
immediately
then,
and
they
don’t
give
it
because
the
country
has
foreign
exchange
control
regulations,
which
every
county
has
including
our
own,
that
then
the
right
to
take,
the
right
to
inherit
is
destroyed
because
the
right
to
receive
and
to
receive
immediately
not
conditionally
and
not
tomorrow,
the
next
day
but
today
that
destroys
the
right
to
inherit
and
this
is
been
the
holding
of
the
california
supreme
court,
its
been
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
oregon
repeatedly.
on
top
of
that,
i’d
like
to
say
here
for
just
a
moment,
that
these
two
requirements
of
the
statute
are
almost
identical
with
the
statute
as
it
was
at
the
time
clark
versus
allen
was
decided
and
the
date
of
that
case
was
1942,
those
two
requirements;
the
no
discrimination
and
the
right
to
immediate
payment
of
an
inheritance
were
in
the
california
statute.
now
oregon
in
1951
when
they
adapted
this
statute
with
which
we
are
concerned
put
in
another
requirement.
they
said
that
the
alien,
nonresident
alien
must
have
the
free
use
benefit
and
control
of
his
money
without
confiscation
by
his
government
in
whole
or
in
part.
now
this
is
a
partial
adaptation
of
the,
what
we
call
eastern
statutes,
which
are
recording
statute,
new
york
has
it
in
269(a)
of
the
new
york
circuits
court
act,
massachusetts
has
it,
pennsylvania
has
it,
new
jersey
has
it.
in
those
states,
by
statute
the
surrogate's
probate
judges
may
order
actual
distribution
if
in
their
opinion
the
foreign
heir
is
not
going
to
get
the
full
enjoyment
of
these
inheritance
of
free
benefit
use
and
control.
this
was
the
forum,
i
would
say
this
269(a)
of
the
new
york
circuit
court
act
was
before
this
court
in
ioannou
versus
new
york
in
1962
in
which
the
court
declined
to
take
jurisdiction
because
it
felt
there
were
no
substantial
federal
question.
however
mr.
justice
douglas
joined
by
mr.
justice
black
filed
a
dissent
in
which
they
said
that
they
felt
that
it
was
time
to
reexamine
clark
versus
allen,
that
this
issue
was
not
foreclosed
by
clark
versus
allen.
so,
then
as
i
say
on
the
top
of
pre-use
benefit
and
control
they
imposed
this
that
the
foreign
country
may
not
partially
or
wholly
confiscate
the
right
of
inheritance
or
the
inheritance
of
the
foreign
heir
coming
from
the
state
of
oregon.
now
obviously
no
foreign
country
is
ever
going
to
admit
or
say
or
confess
that
they
are
confiscating
anything
much
less
an
inheritance
coming
from
an
estate
from
the
state
of
oregon
to
them.
how
you
can
prove
that,
that
they
do
or
don’t
is
something
that
i
think
no
one
can
answer.
however,
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
found
it
very,
very
convenient
answer
to
that.
it
came
out
the
estate
of
pikaicho
(ph),
these
are
cited
in
my
brief,
a
czechoslovak,
a
man
who
was
a
resident
of
czechoslovakia,
citizen
of
czechoslovakia,
domiciliary
of
czechoslovakia
had
come
over
before
the
first
war,
had
gone
back
shortly
after
the
end
of
the
first
war,
had
a
family
there,
he
left
a
bank
account
in
portland.
and
he
lived
and
there
was
no
question
about
him
being
a
domiciliary,
he
died
some
eight
or
ten
years
after
he
had
returned
home,
he
left
his
bank
account.
in
that
case
involving
czechoslovakia,
the
court
escheated
it,
disregarded
the
rule
that
the
law
of
the
domicile
of
decedent
governs
the
succession
of
personal
property,
ignored
that
or
refused
to
adopt
it
that
way
and
escheated
the
estate.
and
they
decided
it
on
this
third
ground
which
i
just
mentioned
by
simply
saying
that
czechoslovakia
is
on
the
list
of
the
treasury
department
circular
655,
which
is
a
circular
issued
under
a
federal
regulation
that
no
checks
of
united
states,
well
the
united
states
treasury
maybe
sent
to
that
country.
and
as
a
result
of
that
no
social
security
checks,
no
veteran
checks,
no
subject
of
that
kind
go
to
these
countries.
they
are,
they’re
what
you
might
say
the
communist
led
countries,
red
china,
the
north
korea,
north
vietnam
and
so
forth,
soviet
union
is
also
on
it
and
czechoslovakia
also
was
at
that
time
and
still
is
i
would
say.
but
anyway
they
said
that
the
very
fact
that
czechoslovakia
was
on
that
treasury
department
list
of
countries
that
in
itself
was
evidence
that
that
was
at
least
partial
confiscation
by
the
government
of
czechoslovakia
of
the
inheritances
of
these
people
and
therefore
on
basis
of
that
they
escheated
the
estate.
now
as
i
said
again
the
fundamental
question
is
may
any
state
of
the
union
lay
down
its
own
conditions
and
say
to
the
foreign
country
if
you
don’t
confirm
your
inheritance
laws
to
ours
your
people
can’t
inherit.
if
you
do
not
allow
american
citizens
immediate
payment
disregard
your
foreign
exchange
control
or
disregard
any
internal
laws
that
you
may
have
to
govern
your
foreign
--
supply,
if
you
withhold
that
money
for,
even
in
instance
if
he
can’t
have
it
on
demand
that
then
there
the
prosecution
fails
and
we
will
began
to
confiscate
your
people’s
inheritance.
on
the
third
requirement
they
say
if
you
don’t
give
these
people
the
free
use
benefit
and
control
of
the
money
whatever
these
words
mean,
they
can
mean
almost
anything,
but
they
say
if
you
don’t
give
them
the
free
use
benefit
and
control
of
that
money
and
if
you
confiscate
any
portion
of
it
then
we
again
will
not
allow
you
to
inherit.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
there
are
about
10
statutes,
they
are
listed
in
my
brief,
the
states
with
which
we
are
primarily
concerned
here,
and
i’ll
say
again
oregon
is
the
most
let’s
say
brutal
statute,
the
most
demanding
statute
because
they
not
only
require
reciprocity
of
inheritance,
they
not
only
require
the
immediate
right
of
payment
but
they
have
this
free
use
benefit
control
without
confiscation.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
california’s
is
also
an
escheat
statute
but
each
of
them
california,
oregon,
iowa,
nebraska,
north
carolina
have
provisions
whereby
if
the
non-resident
alien
do
not
inherit
they
escheat
only
if
there
is
no
eligible
heir,
if
there
is
no
other
heir
living
outside
the
country,
for
instance
if
he
has
an
relative
in
great
britain
or
if
he
had
a
relative
in
this
country,
in
canada,
australia,
wherever
it
is.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
there
is
no
escheat
provision
in
the
new
york
statute.
there
is
no
escheat
provision
in
any
of
the
eastern
states.
i
am
speaking
of
massachusetts,
pennsylvania,
new
jersey
and
so
forth.
oregon,
california,
now
montana
has
a
particularly
strong
escheat
statute
in
this
respect
that
in
oregon,
in
california,
in
iowa,
nebraska
they
will
allow
an
eligible
heir
to
take.
however,
in
-–
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
no
--
yes
oregon
will
too,
but
in
montana
the
share
of
the
ineligible
heir
escheat.
for
instance
in
oregon
if
he
has
a
brother
in
portland
and
if
he
has
a
brother
in
let's
say
czechoslovakia
or
east
germany
then
the
brother
in
portland
will
get
the
whole
estate,
but
in
montana,
montana
will
escheat
the
half
interest
of
the
brother
who
in
ineligible
if
the
brother
in
this
country
for
instance
the
eligible
heir
take
it
off.
now
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
lies
of
course
in
the
fact
that
in
the
entire
concept
of
these
statutes
is
to
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
force
a
foreign
government
to
confirm
its
laws
and
its
rights
of
inheritance
and
monetary
policies
and
so
forth
to
those
of
state
of
oregon.
i
like
to
read
to
you
if
i
may
the
declaration
of
purpose
as
stated
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
claston
versus
schmidt
quoted
on
page
15
of
my
brief.
they
say
here
the
purpose
of
61107
which
is
the
immediate
predecessor
of
this
statute
is
clear
and
beyond
doubt.
it
was
enacted
to
assure
receipt
for
rights
of
inheritance
to
american
citizens
and
alien
residents
or
citizens.
it
was
in
a
sense
an
inducement
to
foreign
nations
to
so
frame
the
inheritance
laws
of
their
respective
countries
in
a
manner
which
would
ensure
to
oregonians
the
same
opportunities
to
inherit
and
to
take
personal
property
abroad
that
they
enjoy
in
the
state
of
oregon.
now
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
in
the
ioannou
case
pointed
out
that
if
the
new
york
statute
was
intended
to
prevent
a
foreign
country
from
getting
american
funds
then
there
was
a
serious
question
if
it
was
not
an
attempt
to
regulate
the
foreign
relationships
of
united
states
and
that
i
think
is
exactly
the
point
that
i
am
making
here
on
the
unconstitutionality.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
no
sir
it
does
not.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
for
the
reason
your
honor
i
personally
and
i
was
the
one
of
course
who,
to
a
large
extent
recommended
the
ground
to
appeal
here
was
the
fact
that
i
think
that
this
court,
mr.
justice
douglas
was
right
in
his
interpretation
although
it
was
a
strict
interpretation
of
article
4
of
the
treaty
of
1923
in
clark
versus
allen.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
on
the
government’s
basis
we
might
have
to
and
secondarily
also
not
only
that
but
we
think
that
clark
versus
allen
has
been
overcome
by
the
developments
of
the
last
20
years
between
1947
and
1967.
since
that
time
all
of
these
decisions
have
come
down
as
vast
amount
of
litigations
has
gone
through
the
courts.
we
have
had
the
situation
in
california
where
in
1961
the,
a
substantial
estate
was
taken
away
from
the
russian
heirs
on
12
reporting
page
analysis
of
the
government
of
the
soviet
union
of
their
ideology,
their
constitution.
there
were
charges
there
that
had
secret
laws
and
laws
that
although
they
were
on
the
books
weren’t
enforced
and
so
forth.
it
was
a
long,
long
opinion
and
on
basis
of
that
it
was
held
that
the
russian
heirs
had
no
right
to
inherit
that
estate.
now
in
1966
in
latin
versus
terry,
just
recently
the
california
supreme
court
ruled
for
reciprocity
with
the
soviet
union
and
held
that
all
this
logic
that
we
recited,
i
should
say
the
district
court
of
appeal,
not
the
supreme
court
recited,
was
wrong.
that
if
we
were
do
the
very
thing
that
they
did
in
(inaudible)
take
the
soviet
judicial
system,
the
soviet
legal
system,
those
foreign
funds
control
the
whole
things
take
it
apart,
the
minute
we
do
that
we
are
interfering
and
risking
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
and
this
is
exactly
what
we
contend
here
that
when
the
courts
of
estate
must
take
a
foreign
country's
laws,
it’s
constitution,
it’s
ideology,
its
judicial
system
apart
and
say
well
yes
but
we
don’t
think
that
you
do
allow
american
citizens
the
right
to
inherit.
yes
you
have
foreign
exchange
control
laws,
but
under
those
laws
you
don’t
give
our
american
citizens
immediate
right
to
inherit,
therefore
you
have
lost
your
right
of
inheritance.
when
they
try
to
take
it
apart
and
say
well
you
are
actually
confiscating
the
inheritances
coming
out
of
oregon
possibly
by
an
unrealistic
rate
of
exchange
by
any
number
of
articles
is
that
that
it
might
be
accused
of
using,
that
the
state
is
definitely
invading
the
field
of
the
federal
government.
now
it
is
said
and
i
there
is
myself
mr.
justice
fortas
and
as
of
your
question,
you
say
the
state
department
say,
well
this
hasn’t
--
has
that
little
effect.
they
didn’t
say
no
effect
they
said
this
had
little
effect
on
the
conduct
of
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
i
say
that
again
that
that
is
not
the
test
of
constitutionality.
it’s
the
potential
and
it’s
the
possibility.
now,
to
this
point
only
10
states
of
the
united
states
have
reciprocal
inheritance
right
statute
and
they
are
listed
in
my
brief
and
with
the
confiscatory
provisions
that
if
these
conditions
are
not
met
then
we
can’t
escheat.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
suggested
that
in
his
brief
that
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
1954
treaty
applied
to
residents
of
the
russian
occupied
zone
of
germany
or
if
the
court
were
now
to
say
that
article
iv
of
the
1923
treaty
does
provide
for
reciprocal
rights
of
inheritance
in
respect
to
personal
property
then
there
would
be,
i
would
say
that
the
court
could
duck
the
issue
of
constitutionality.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
yes,
that’s
substantially
so
not,
the
only
the
part
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
oh
yes,
yes,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
but
what
we
say
about
clark
versus
allen,
the
part
of
that
clark
versus
allen
which
rejected
the,
let
me
remind
you
this
was
the
argument
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
that
the
california
statute
which
is
almost
what
the
same
is
the
oregon
statute
now
that
that
invaded
the
foreign
relations
field
of
the
federal
government
that
is
--
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
in
respect
to
that
california
statute
which
is
almost
what
is
the
oregon
statute
said
that
it
was
not
a
statute
of
inheritance
it
was
a
statute
of
confiscation
and
retaliation.
and
the
attorney
general
in
clark
versus
allen
case
said
in
his
brief
that
the
statute
has
already
been
a
recurrent
source
of
friction
in
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
said
that.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
unfortunately
not.
however,
i
still
say
that
that
is
not
the
test.
if
you
can
--
the
fact
that
you
can't
demonstrate
that
a
case
such
as
the
russian
case
which
i
just
told
you,
now
we
had
one
case
in
california
where
the
california
supreme
court
denied
reciprocity
with
yugoslavia
in
san
francisco
on
identically
the
same
case,
identically
the
same
witnesses
including
the
ambassador
of
yugoslavia,
the
los
angeles
case
held
against
reciprocity,
held
with
for
reciprocity
in
the
san
francisco
court
held
against
reciprocity
and
the
california
supreme
court
sustained
it.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
we
contented
sir
that
the
1954
treaty
governs
that
these
people
and
there
was
an
evidence
of
certificate
by
the
foreign
office
of
the
government
in
bonn
to
the
effect
that
the
people
in
the
russian
zone
of
germany
have
the
same
citizenship
exactly
as
the
citizens
and
the
residents
of
the
federal
republic,
and
that
therefore
they
were
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
1954
treaty
however,
the
state
department
took
a
contrary
position.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
no
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
we’ve
recognized
bonn
as
the
only
legitimate
government
for
the
entire
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
yes
sir,
there
is.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
1954
treaty
that
its
territorial
application
shall
be
to
the
territory
over
which
the
federal
republic
exercises
sovereignty.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
excluding
the
russian
zone,
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
and
in
the
letter
to
the
state
--
by
the
state
department
to
the
attorney
general
of
oregon
and
also
in
their
publication,
the
state
department
publishes
a
guidance
but
--
they
say
it
does
not
apply
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
court
please.
i
would
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white
on
the
policy
or
the
law
of
the
state
of
oregon
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
reciprocity
statute.
i
think
i
can
correctly
and
definitively
inform,
your
honor,
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
reciprocity
statute,
the
first
one
in
1937,
there
was
never
any
question
about
the
right
of
inheritance
of
any
non-resident
alien
real
or
personal
property.
we
did
of
course
years
ago
had
alien
land
laws
which
were
set
aside
by
assertive
decisions
of
this
court
which
prevented
aliens
not
eligible
for
citizenship
to
owning
their
property
in
california
or
even
washington,
there’s
a
series
of
cases
on
there.
but
prior
to
1937,
there
was
no
restriction
whatsoever
in
respect
to
either
real
or
personal
property
of
non-resident
aliens
regardless
of
where
they
resided.
of
course
in
1937
the
political
situation
in
the
world
was
quite
different,
prior
to
the
war
and
the
upheaval
since
that
time
did
not
exist.
so
it
does
affect,
the
reciprocal
inheritance
rights
statute
did
for
the
first
affect
the
right,
inheritance
rights
of
any
non-resident
aliens.
now
speaking
of
the
termination
of
the
1923
treaty,
i’d
like
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
number
1
to
the
fact
that
we
appealed
only
on
the
constitutionality
question.
we
did
not
appeal
on
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty,
although
the
attorney
general
of
oregon
has,
by
his
brief
and
by
his
argument
today
sought
to
interject
that
issue.
we
say
to
your
honor
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
he
says
that
the
west,
by
correspondence
and
dealing
with
the
west
german
government,
the
bonn
government
and
the
united
states
government,
the
1923
treaty
has
been
rescinded
and
advocated
terminated,
but
he
doesn’t
--
in
the
same
communication
in
which
the
state
department
said
that
the
1923
treaty
still
applies
to
the
russian
zone
of
occupation
and
that
same
--
in
that
same
communication
they
said
the
1954
treaty
does
not
apply
and
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
you
can't
say
that
the
bonn
government
can
terminate
the
1923
treaty
in
respect
to
the
russian
zone
and
--
but
that
they
can't
say
that
the
1954
treaty
extends
to
our
citizens,
our
nationals
in
the
russian
zone.
and
that
carries
me
to
next
point.
it
has
been
said
here
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
reciprocity.
mind
you
reciprocity
can
be
proven
either
by
treaty
or
by
reciprocity,
the
fact
that
you
go
into
the
laws
of
the
country,
inheritance
laws,
the
property
change
control
laws,
you
produce
mountains
of
decrees
by
probate
courts
of
the
foreign
countries,
you
produce
lists
of
remittances,
you
produce
the
battle
of
the
experts,
you
get
one
set
of
experts
that
say
that
there
was
reciprocity
and
the
next
set
of
experts
says
no
and
the
question
as
i
think
professor
shatkin
pointed
out
in
his
article
it's
the
person
who
can
hire
the
most
expert
and
the
most
expensive
experts
is
the
person
that
usually
wins.
but
the
point
is
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
reciprocity
in
this
record
for
the
simple
reason
that
from
the
inception
of
this
case,
the
east
german
people
took
the
position
that
they
were
governed
by
german
law,
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
german
--
the
benefit
of
the
german
treaty
of
1954.
the
foreign
office
of
the
federal
republic
took
that
position
on
a
special
document
which
is
in
evidence
here,
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief
and,
they
said
those
people
have
the
same
nationality
as
the
residents
of
the
federal
republic
therefore
they
are
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
1954
treaty
as
it
applies
to
inheritance
rights,
having
in
mind
that
there
is
differentiation
if
the
court
please
between
territorial
application
of
the
treaty
and
the
personal
rights
granted
by
a
treaty.
the
personal
rights
granted
by
a
treaty
are
given
to
nationals
of
that
country,
not
that
the
nationals
have
to
reside
within
the
borders
of
that
country.
they
can
be
residing
in
australia,
in
timbuktu,
in
alaska,
any
place
in
the
world
but
every
german
is
bound
by
that
treaty
if
he
is
a
german
national
and
that
is
the
position
that
we
took
that
these
people
granted
that
they
were
residing
east
of
the
border,
granted
that
they
are
residing
east
of
the
wall,
but
they're
still
germans,
they
are
governed
by
german
law
and
they're
entitled
to
german
treaty,
that’s
the
position
we
took
and
it’s
quite
impossible
under
those
circumstances
if
you
take
that
position
to
say
we’re
going
to
bring
in
evidence
of
reciprocity
for
a
country
that
doesn’t
exist.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
yes
your
honor,
because
we
did
not
appeal
on
that
subject
and
it
think
i
gave
your
honor
the
reason
for
that.
i
don’t
say
that
if
this
court
rejects
our
argument
on
the
constitutionality
that
we
would
not
welcome
the
1950
--
the
1923
treaty
being
re-construed
to
include
personal
property,
but
that’s
not
our
position
here.
we
did
not
appeal
on
that
ground
and
we
don’t
ask
the
court
to
do
that
here,
i
don’t
think
we
can.
by
the
same
token
i
don’t
think
that
the
distinct
not
having
cross
appealed
on
the
oregon
supreme
court’s
finding
that
the
1923
treaty
applies,
i
don’t
think
the
state
cannot
come
and
say
that
the
treaty
was
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
are
you
speaking
of
the
attorney
general
of
oregon
or
the
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
we
take
the
position
your
honor
that
we
did
not
respond
to
his
brief
for
the
reason
that,
that
was
brought
in
on
his
own
volition.
he
is
the
one
that
asked
the
court
to
re-construe
and
reexamine
it’s
construction
of
the
1923
treaty
in
clark
versus
allen.
we
did
not
ask
that.
he
brought
that
in
and
we
felt
that
having
appealed
solely
on
the
constitutional
issue
that
it
was
not
up
to
us
to
argue
that
point.
i
would
like
to
just
in
conclusion
i
think
would
just
like
to
say
that
i
pointed
our
earlier
that
are
now
ten
states
of
the
union
that
would
have
these
reciprocity
statues.
there
are
great
many
cases
in
california,
in
oregon,
in
montana,
other
reciprocity
states
being
held
in
abeyance
waiting
for
this
court
to
decide
on
the
constitutionality
of
these
reciprocity
inherent
right
statue.
i
will
say
this,
if
the
court
does
place
the
stamp
of
approval
of
constitutionality
on
the
oregon
statue
and
by
doing
that
on
the
rest
of
the
statues
these
are
certainly
going
to
proliferate
and
although
the
state
department
may
say
no
that
at
this
point
there
has
been
no
--
there
has
been
only
little
effect
on
the
foreign
relations
of
united
states
i
can
visualize
a
very
grave
serious
situation
developing
in
later
years
and
in
the
future
if
these
statutes
are
held
to
be
constitutional
and
thereby
i
ask
that
the
courts
rule
to
be
unconstitutional.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
that
is
what
the
state
department
should
say.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
no
it’s
just
a
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
federal
republic
of
germany.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
the
united
states
has
a
number
of
treaties
with
foreign
countries,
which
for
instance
there
is
an
1852
treaty
with
argentina
which
is
frequently
cited
in
these
cases,
because
for
instance
with
yugoslavia
there
was
the
mutual
most
favored
nation
clause
in
the
yugoslavia
treaty
of
1881
and
the
serbian
treaty
and
it
was
held
--
it
was
argued
and
also
inferentially
held
that
the
most
favored
nation
provision
of
the
serbian
treaty,
the
argentine
treaty
applied.
the
swiss
have
a
treaty,
the
french
have
a
treaty,
the
british
have
a
treaty
and
nobody
ever
questions
reciprocity
with
any
of
the
western
countries.
it’s
an
iron
curtain
rule,
the
only
countries
against
which
the
reciprocity
statues
have
ever
been
asserted
and
they’ve
gone
to
any
higher
court
is
in
respect
to
the
iron
curtain
country.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
the
same
constitutional
provisions
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
with
your
concurrence
with
mr.
justice
black,
ruled
that
whenever
a
state
inheritance
law
effects
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
interferes
in
anyway
with
the
foreign
relations
of
the
of
the
united
states
then
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
exclusive
federal
power
to
govern
foreign
relations,
which
in
essence
is
based
on
article
1
section
10
of
constitution,
which
is
generally
cited.
there
is
also
at
times
is
recited
a
commerce
clause
and
the
due
process
clause.
but
basically
our
appeal
has
been
on
article
16
--
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
i'm
very
sorry
sir,
i
do
not
follow
your
question.
mr.
peter
a.
schwabe,
sr.
yes
sir
and
that
any
incursion
by
any
state
upon
the
field
of
foreign
relations
in
any
of
its
domestic
legislation
is
unconstitutional.
it
may
not
given
effect
and
that
i
think
is
the
--
also
in
clark
versus
allen
that
very
statement
was
made
that
while
traditionally
rights
of
inheritance
are
within
the
province
of
the
individual
state,
when
the
legislation
in
respect
to
inheritance
does
crossover
into
the
field
of
foreign
relations
affecting
the
relations
of
the
united
states
with
a
foreign
country
that
then
it
becomes
an
unconstitutional
and
an
unauthorized
invasion
by
the
state
with
the
exclusive
federal
part
of
government
to
foreign
relations.
