justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
statute
in
oregon
differs
from
some
of
the
other
statues
in
respect
of
the
remedy
that
is
to
say
does
the
new
york
statute
for
example
a
deferral
statute,
a
withholding
statute,
withholding
the
inheritance
rather
than
one
of
escheat?
justice
abe
fortas
is
oregon
--
are
there
other
states
have
escheat
statutes
rather
than
withholding
a
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
apart
from
that
[inaudible]
whether
the
other
statutes
are
as
escheat
statutes
are
merely
withholding
or
referral
statutes?
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
new
york
for
example?
justice
abe
fortas
well
government
doesn’t,
the
government
brief
is
not
go
along
with
your
man,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
then
why
do
you
insist
on
unconstitutionality
rather
than
the
anomaly
in
the
construction
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
see
on
your
basis,
you
wouldn’t
have
to
modify
clark
against
allen,
on
the
government’s
basis
we
may
have
to?
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
their
position
as
to
whether
the
1923
treaty
or
1954
treaty
governs
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
is,
how
do
they
reconcile
that,
we
have
not
recognized
the
east
germany
have
we,
we
don’t
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
we
still
recognize
bonn
as
a
government
of
all
of
germany.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
1954
treaty
which
confines
itself
for
instance?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
is
the
defined
as
excluding
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
still
say
you're
not
relying
on
the
1954
treaty,
but
rather
on
the
point
with
respect
to
constitutionality?
justice
abe
fortas
well
there's
a
little
offering
that’s
here,
it
seems
to
me
because
we
have
a
brief
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
in
which
he
argues
a
treaty
point
and
you
say
you
don’t
rely
on
it.
we
will
be
glad
to
have
a
benefaction
on
the
treaty
point
if
we
can't
decide
it
on
constitutional
basis.
there's
nobody
here
that’s
really
taking
the
position
that
the
attorney
general
expressed
in
his
brief
to
this
court,
isn't
that?
