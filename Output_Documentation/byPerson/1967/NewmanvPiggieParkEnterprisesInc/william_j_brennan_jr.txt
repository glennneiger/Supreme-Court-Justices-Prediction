justice

mr.
greenberg,
if
you
bring
out
that
one
of
these
--
as
to
what
the
(inaudible)
--
does
he
have
to
pay
the
assessed
counsel
fees
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
apply
the
same
statutes
for
the
defenses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
--
yes,
the
plaintiff
will
be
assessed
only
if
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
--
the
defense
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
just
because
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
just
because
you
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
assume
if
the
plaintiff
of
a
lawsuit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
not
guiltless,
and
he
lost
them.
in
that
situation
you
would
say
he
is
not
to
be
assessed
counsel
fees
unless
he
has
been
guilty
of
harassment
or
something
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right,
it
might
just
the
plaintiff,
whereas
the
defendant
puts
in
a
defense
and
it
may
influence,
assume
it's
not
frivolous,
and
not
a
frivolous
defense
and
yet
it
doesn't
prevail
you
would
say
nevertheless
he
should
be
assessed
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
the
defendant
loses,
if
he
puts
the
defense
and
loses
he
has
to
pay
the
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
conceding
that
statute
contemplates
and
awarded
fees
to
these
prevailing
party
or
plaintiff.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
you're
suggesting
however
is
that
standard
in
the
case
of
the
defendant,
this
kind
of
litigation.
it
should
be
--
if
he
loses
you
should
say
that
if
he
loses
then
the
court
should
award
the
counsel
fee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
in
the
case
of
the
plaintiff,
if
the
plaintiff
rule
the
defendant
should
not
be
awarded
the
counsel
fees
unless
it's
established
that
the
plaintiff
brought
to
shoot
to
harass
the
defendant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
greenberg,
don't
you
have
some
other
federal
statutes
perhaps
(inaudible)
like
the
fela
and
other
statues
which
makes
--
provides
for
counsel
fees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
rather
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

the
other
statutes
that
we

you're
suggesting
are
explicit

of

this
is

they're

the

justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
this

here
made
the

don't
you
