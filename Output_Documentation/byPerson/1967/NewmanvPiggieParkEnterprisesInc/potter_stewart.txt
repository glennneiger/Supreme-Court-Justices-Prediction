justice
potter
stewart
of
course
as
far
as
--
unless
i'm
mistaking
and
maybe
i
am
but
as
far
as
we
now
know
the
district
court
might
award
counsel
fees
or
i'm
mistaken.
this
is
a
remand
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
that
test
is
not
yet
been
applied
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
still
remains
true
that
for
all
we
now
know
despite
of
those
difficulties
the
district
court
might
in
its
discretion
applying
that
test
award
the
plaintiff's
full
counsel
fees
in
this
particular
case.
i'm
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
thinking
out
loud
that
perhaps
this
isn't
right
for
adjudication.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
at
the
district
court
level
the
plaintiff
lost
five
or
six
of
its
case,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
district
--
at
the
trial
level
in
this
case
if
i
understand
it
correctly
the
defendant
won
five
-
six
of
his
case
and
the
plaintiff
was
five
-
six
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
one
lost
him
--
five
out
of
the
six.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
--
so,
i
--
that
leads
to
my
real
question
mr.
greenberg.
you
think
the
prevailing
party
should
be
the
--
after
all
the
appellate
procedures
are
completed.
that's
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
as
they
were
in
this
case.
