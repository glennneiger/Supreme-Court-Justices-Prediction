mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
issue
is
the
correctness
of
the
standard
which
was
announced
by
the
fourth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
for
a
provision
of
title
2
of
the
united
states'
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
prove
--
the
public
accommodations
provision
which
provides
for
counsel
fees
in
public
accommodations
cases.
the
provision
is
on
page
2
of
our
brief
and
i
will
read
it,
it's
very
brief.
in
any
action
commenced
pursuant
to
this
subchapter
of
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
allow
the
prevailing
party
other
than
the
united
states
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs.
case
arose
in
the
following
way,
the
respondent
corporation
owns
six
restaurants
which
serve
southern
style
barbeque
various
locations
in
the
state
of
south
carolina,
five
of
these
restaurants
are
drive-ins,
one
is
a
sit
down
restaurant
in
downtown
columbia.
the
president
of
the
respondent
corporation
has
been
in
such
business
for
decades
and
has
called
himself
in
the
record
a
pioneer
in
the
drive-in
barbeque
business
in
south
carolina.
the
businesses
are
substantial
in
size,
food
purchases
are
in
excess
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
a
year
and
the
gross
volume
is
--
of
sales
is
obviously
in
excess
of
that.
five
of
the
six
restaurants
are
in
interstate
highways
and
all
of
them
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
policy
of
discrimination
was
followed
after
passage
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
after
decisions
of
this
court
uphold
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
the
answer
or
the
answers
filed
by
respondent
in
this
case
knew
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
asserted
that
they
were
incorrectly
decided.
the
plaintiffs
brought
suit
in
december
1964,
and
respondent
filed
an
answer
and
two
amended
answers,
one
in
february,
the
next
in
august
1965
and
the
third
in
march
1966.
these
answers
submitted
an
array
of
defenses.
first
of
all,
the
first
second
and
third
answer
denied
the
practice
of
racial
discrimination.
the
answers
denied,
they
served
interstate
travelers,
they
denied
that
they
served
the
substantial
amount
of
food
moving
in
commerce.
they
asserted
that
the
petitioner
had
a
constitutional
right
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
not
to
be
subjected
to
involuntary
servitude
and
serve
persons
against
his
will.
it
was
the
first
amendment
religious
privilege
claim
that
petitioner
asserted
that
his
religion
required
him
to
act
this
way.
there
was
an
equal
protection
and
due
process
claims
submitted
by
petitioners
and
then
there
was
a
claim
that
drive-in
restaurants
were
not
covered
by
the
1964
civil
rights
act
and
there
was
a
claim
that
i
mentioned
that
courts
were
not
foreclose
if
the
lower
court
is
not
foreclosed
by
decisions
of
this
court
because
those
decisions
were
wrong.
there
was
finally
a
well
over
a
year
following
the
filing
of
complaint,
a
trial
that
went
into
two
days
and
at
this
trial
the
plaintiff
proved
discrimination,
went
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
prove
that
the
food
which
was
served
in
the
restaurant
had
moved
in
interstate
commerce
and
indeed
we
have
not
printed
the
entire
record
in
order
to
spear
ourselves
in
the
court
but
more
than
a
hundred
pages
of
record
goes
into
one
of
the
origins
in
the
root
that
this
food
has
traveled
before
it
came
to
rest
in
the
drive-in
restaurants.
our
witness
who
testified
by
discrimination
the
other
witness
were
cross-examined
and
then
the
respondent
put
on
his
case
and
after
all
this,
the
respondent
did
admit
having
practiced
racial
discrimination
although
it
was
denied
in
three
answers
and
admitted
that
a
substantial
amount
of
food
had
actually
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
the
district
court
entered
an
order
that
one
of
the
restaurants
which
was
a
sit-down
restaurant
in
downtown
columbia
was
required
to
end
discrimination
under
the
1964
act.
it
said
that
the
drive-ins
were
not
covered
by
the
act
because
as
it
read
the
statutory
language
a
principle
part
of
the
food
served
--
principle
amount
of
the
food
served
was
not
served
for
consumption
on
the
premises
being
a
drive-in
and
people
would
drive
a
way
and
it
--
there
was
a
prayer
for
counsel
fees
which
is
the
issue
in
this
case
and
the
trial
court
held
simply
with
no
explanation
that
petitioner
were
not
entitled
to
counsel
fees.
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
question
of
whether
drive-ins
are
covered
by
the
1964
act
and
there
has
been
--
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
it
also
wrote
on
the
question
of
counsel
fees
page
165
of
the
record,
that
is
the
majority
of
the
court
did
that
in
exercising
its
discretion
the
district
court
may
properly
consider
whether
any
of
the
numerous
defenses
interposed
by
defendants
were
presented
for
purposes
of
delay
and
not
in
good
faith
but
the
test
should
be
and
this
is
what
the
court
termed
it,
a
subjective
one
for
no
litigant
ought
to
be
punished
under
the
guise
of
an
award
of
counsel
fees
or
in
any
other
manner
from
taking
a
position
in
court
in
which
he
honestly
believes
however
lacking
in
merit
that
position
may
be.
the
court
also
--
may
also
consider
whether
defendants
acted
in
good
faith
in
denying
discrimination.
judge
winter
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
on
the
counsel
fees
as
long
as
judge
sobeloff
adjoined
which
disagreed
with
the
majority
standard
and
judge
winter
wrote
good
faith
standing
alone
should
not
always
immunize
the
defendant
from
an
award
against
him.
specifically
in
this
case
defendants
are
not
entitled
to
the
defense
good
faith
and
regard
to
the
major
portion
of
their
defenses.
and
that
the
district
court
should
be
instructed
to
make
an
allowance
in
regard
to
some
of
defendant's
defenses
and
in
its
discretion
to
consider
an
allowance
for
the
remainder
of
defendant's
defenses
depending
upon
its
determination
of
defendant's
good
faith
and
honest
belief.
we
submit
that
the
majority
of
the
court
interpreted
the
counsel
fee
provision
of
the
1964
act
incorrectly
and
we
also
submit
that
the
minority
test
while
it
might
to
some
extent
forward
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
be
consonant
with
the
act
is
also
not
the
test
which
this
court
should
adopt
as
a
proper
standard
for
awarding
counsel
fees
in
public
accommodations,
title
2
cases.
the
generality,
the
very
generality
of
the
provision
obviously
leaves
it
to
the
courts
to
announce
and
develop
standards.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
no
monitory
amount.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
there
is
--
by
sealing,
you
mean
how
much
money
can
be
awarded?
the
statute
says
nothing
and
i
would
assume
that
the
lower
courts
would
use
the
ordinary
standards
that
they
do
in
a
variety
of
cases
in
which
counsel
fees
are
awarded
and
those
standards
depend
upon
a
good
number
of
factors.
the
amount
of
time
put
in
bar
associations
standards,
what
opposing
counsel
has
been
paid
and
various
matters
of
that
sort.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
was
remand
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
award
counsel
fees
according
to
a
subjective
test
standing.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
true.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
test
has
not
been
applied
by
the
district
court
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
if
it
were
applied
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
if
it
were
applied,
it
would
be
difficult
to
know
first
of
all
how
petitioners
could
meet
that
subjective
test,
how
petitioners
could
prove
what
went
on
in
the
mind
of
respondent
particularly
reminder
--
mind
of
respondent,
a
corporation.
and
then
secondly,
whether
the
amount
of
counsel
fees
awarded
under
that
test
would
be
less
than
the
amount
awarded
under
either
judge
winter's
and
sobeloff's
test
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
or
the
test
that
we
are
proposing
here,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
might
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
possible
but
so
--
at
least
so
far
as
petitioners
are
concerned
in
arguing
of
making
a
presentation
to
the
court
as
to
what
counsel
fees
should
be.
petitioners
would
be
at
a
disadvantage
almost
to
the
point
of
finding
themselves
in
an
impossible
position
as
to
request
counsel
fees
on
a
subjective
test
standard.
our
position
is
that
congress
did
more
than
codify
the
preexisting
law
of
equity.
obviously
under
existing
standards
without
the
statute
counsel
fees
have
been
awarded
though
not
frequently
in
litigation
generally
and
in
some
few
civil
rights
cases.
they've
been
awarded
as
in
the
rolex
case
or
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
a
party
has
acted
unconscionably
or
vexatiously
or
perhaps
presented
frivolous
defenses.
but
we
submit
that
the
key
factors
in
this
case
ought
to
be
those
which
carry
out
the
broad
remedial
purposes
of
title
2
after
all
title
2
was
a
great
innovation
in
american
law,
its
purpose
was
for
the
first
time
to
make
public
accommodations
available
to
all
americans
without
regard
to
race
throughout
the
country.
that
purpose
could
be
achieved
in
a
variety
of
ways
the
most
desirable
way
would
be
voluntary
compliance.
thereafter,
the
next
most
desirable
way
would
be
some
sort
of
judicial
compulsion
which
would
encourage
the
greatest
degree
of
voluntary
compliance.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
statute
says
prevailing
party
and
that
would
be
possible.
the
standard
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that's
not
happen.
the
standard
that
we
would
propose
would
be
that
whereas
in
all
cases
in
which
the
plaintiff
prevails
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
fees
cases
in
which
he
loses
counsel
fees
ought
not
to
be
assessed
against
him
unless
he
acted
for
purpose
of
harassment
or
in
bad
faith
or
in
some
other
way
which
is
so
unusual
is
not
likely
to
occur
because
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
encourage
compliance
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
it
would
not
be
--
put
it
bluntly,
it
would
not
be
a
two-way
street
under
the
standard
we
proposed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
would
be
assessed
in
any
action
which
the
plaintiff
prevail.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
unless,
it
would
be
so
unusual
an
action
if
there
were
no
reason
at
all
where
the
action
should've
been
brought
for
example
there
were
an
offer
of
judgment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
and
the
reason
is
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
if
the
standard
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
if
that
were
not
the
standard
there
would
be
essentially
a
price
of
admission
to
any
restaurant
which
is
that
you've
got
to
at
least
go
to
the
point
of
following
a
lawsuit
in
order
to
get
into
a
restaurant.
if
the
restaurant
were
decides
that
he
wants
to
maintain
a
policy
of
discrimination
and
we
submit
that
would
not
advance
the
policy
of
the
statute
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
situations
in
which
plaintiffs
are
likely
to
bring
lawsuits
for
any
purpose
other
than
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
secure
admission
to
a
restaurant,
a
hotel
or
anything
of
the
sort.
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
conceive
of
situations
and
indeed
there
are
situations
in
which
defendants
have
said
essentially
okay,
if
you
like
to
get
in
to
this
place
sue
me
and
that
means
essentially
the
plaintiff
has
to
at
least
employ
a
lawyer
and
pay
some
sort
of
a
fee
and
even
if
at
that
point
the
defendant
puts
up
a
non-frivolous
defense
and
or
even
essentially
then
entered
--
or
it
makes
an
offer
of
judgment.
the
plaintiff
has
at
least
had
to
pay
the
cost
of
seeing
a
lawyer
for
an
initial
visit
and
that
ought
not
to
be
the
ticket
of
admission
we
say
to
a
public
accommodation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
are
--
there
is
some
very
slight
legislative
history,
it
tends
to
point
away
from
the
subjective
test
it
has
set
forth
in
our
certiorari
petition
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief
and
it
essentially
talks
about
frivolity
but
it's
not
--
it
really
is
not
very,
very
extensive.
essentially
the
matter
has
really
been
left
to
the
courts
to
interpret
and
we
would
submit
that
it
ought
to
be
interpreted
in
order
to
carry
out
the
general
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
there
has
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
has
not
been
till
now
as
i
know
a
fee
in
a
title
2
case.
there
has
--
(inaudible),
he
knows
the
fee.
well,
the
--
no
one
has
given
me
a
dollar
amount.
all
they
tell
me
is
what
i
did
know,
the
fees
are
moderate
several
hundred
dollars
in
cases
of
this
sort.
i
do
know
that
there
has
been
a
major
title
7
litigation
in
which
counsel
fees
were
allowed
in
the
--
in
virginia
and
richmond
involving
--
that
was
a
quite
a
major
case
involving
this
defendants
the
philip
morris
corporation
and
the
american
--
and
the
tobacco
workers
union.
and
the
court
awarded
counsel
fees
and
parties
then
negotiated
the
fees
between
themselves
and
came
to
an
agreement
and
that
isn't
a
matter
of
several
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
but
that
was
quite
a
major
lawsuit.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
cases
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'm
not
--
i
am
not
asking
the
court
lay
down
the
general
rule
as
to
the
amount
of
fees.
i
think
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
that
the
stand
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
that
for
types
of
litigation
there
are
standards
for
example
an
ordinary
school
desegregation
case.
the
standard
as
of
this
point
seems
to
be
that
if
the
defendant
has
dragged
up
a
litigation
has
interposed
a
lot
of
dilatory
defenses
has
put
the
plaintiff
to
a
great
deal
of
troubles
some
courts
have
awarded
counsel
fees
in
those
situations.
in
other
cases,
the
general
rule
has
been
one
which
turns
upon
the
extent
to
which
a
party
has
acted
vexatiously
but
this
a
statutory
provision,
the
statute
essentially
says
that
counsel
fees
ought
to
be
allowable
and
the
question
now
was,
what
standard
should
the
court
device
to
carry
out
not
only
that
purpose
of
the
statute,
not
into
the
statute
but
the
general
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
my
position.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
that,
i
think
that
discretion
in
this
context
ought
to
be
read
as
in
other
context
that
it
ought
to
be
according
to
some
standards
not
to
unfetter
unbridled
discretion.
and
even
according
to
standard
that
i
have
given
if
discretion
is
used
pursuant
to
implement
that
standard
it
would
not
ordinarily
be
reviewed.
second,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that's
not
the
only
standard.
there
are
cases
in
which
let
us
say
a
plaintiff
might've
acted
for
purposes
of
harassment
or
may
have
for
example
could've
won
his
case
in
a
rather
simple
way
but
went
to
a
great
deal
trouble
to
just
multiply
the
record
and
in
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
that's
comparable
with
the
language
and
certainly
with
the
purpose
but
i
think
the
word
“discretion”
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
the
word
“discretion”
i
think
also
should
be
read
as
to
going
to
amount
as
distinguished
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
an
award.
mr.
jack
greenberg
certainly
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
certainly
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
certainly
not
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
that
certainly
was
not
--
certainly
not
this
case.
now,
the
alternatives
are
that
if
a
plaintiff
wants
to
bring
a
suit
and
as
our
brief
indicates
there
are
hundreds
or
thousands
of
establishments
and
not
the
large
institutions
like
the
big
chain
hotels
but
this
smaller
place
that
do
discriminate
that
if
a
plaintiff
wants
to
bring
a
suit
either
has
to
be
able
to
afford
some
fee
for
lawyer
which
a
typical
plaintiff
would
not
have.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
two
of
them
were
students
and
another
one
was
an
nnacp
executive
secretary.
or
he
would
have
to
go
a
civil
rights
organization
and
none
of
them
are
capable
of
bringing
the
large
number
of
suits
that
are
necessary
or
to
the
department
of
justice
which
also
must
has
been
the
three
sources
or
else
he
may
bring
no
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
jack
greenberg
depends
what
you're
measuring,
the
plaintiff
lose
is
to
five
out
of
six
restaurants
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
but
he
won
in
all
the
legal
issues
and
all
of
evidentiary
issues
except
one
which
the
question
of
whether
or
not
drive-ins
are
covered
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
the
court
of
appeals
that
that
was
mistaken
so
he
really
ended
winning
six
out
of
six.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
there
are
appellate
proceedings.
mr.
jack
greenberg
many
of
these
cases
it
is
found
that
once
the
case
is
filed
and
there
are
some
movement
towards
litigation,
the
establishment
which
is
discriminating
will
cease
discrimination
but
nevertheless
the
plaintiff
for
somebody
has
department
of
justice's
civil
rights
organization
has
had
to
buy
the
ticket
of
admission
which
is
a
visit
to
the
lawyer's
office
filing
of
a
complaint
and
so
forth.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
are
some
other
federal
statutes
that
provide
for
counsel
fees.
the
sherman
act,
clayton
act
for
example
provide
for
counsel
fees
but
that
is
rather
explicit,
it
says,
in
fact
i
was
about
come
to
that
and
i
was
going
to
say
that
if
respondent
had
counsel
argument
here
today
he
might
argue
that
if
congress
had
intended
that
a
provision
like
the
provision
in
the
clayton
act
--
the
sherman
act
applied
would've
said
so
explicitly
rather
than
use
the
general
kind
of
language
that
it
used.
but
it's
--
i
don't
think
it's
unusual
for
congress
to
leave
aspects
of
enforcement
and
interpretation
in
flushing
out
of
various
statutes
to
the
courts
and
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that's
apparently
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
language
is
very
general
and
if
it's
to
be
interpreted
we
would
submit
that
in
order
to
be
interpreted
to
affect
the
purposes
of
the
statute
it
has
to
be
interpreted
along
with
other
provisions
and
doctrines
that
it
affect
the
award
of
counsel
fees
but
those
go
over
of
variety
if
they
are
essentially
in
two
categories
goes
on
which
the
plaintiff
is
vindicating
the
public
right
and
those
which
the
plaintiff
is
vindicating
his
own
private
right
as
a
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
some
of
the
sherman
act
is
explicit.
i
am
--
i
have
some
of
the
other
ones
here
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
--
let's
see
i
have
some
of
them
here.
as
i
have
said
the
sherman
act
is
explicit,
this
court
last
year
had
a
case
under
the
trade
mark
statute
here
and
which
the
term
“counsel
fee”
is
not
used
at
all,
this
question
of
interpretation
of
cost,
the
courts
said,
“well,
that
did
not
include
counsel
fees.”
in
--
there
was
a
case
last
term
involving
rights
of
a
seaman
and
it
was
held
that
counsel
fees
ought
to
be
awarded.
as
of
subject
statute
form
in
two
categories,
those
in
which
the
plaintiff
is
asserting
a
public
right
as
a
sherman
act
case
and
this
kind
of
case
where
the
plaintiffs
is
asserting
a
public
right
after
all
when
he
wins
the
case
it's
hardly
worth
several
hundred
dollars
to
him
just
to
purchase
a
single
dinner
certainly
not
in
a
monetary
sense
but
he's
essentially
won
something
for
the
entire
community
and
we
submit
that
this
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
it
did
but
it
didn't
say
in
what
instances
i
mean
even
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
prevailing
party
in
some
situations
and
as
to
some
issues
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
honestly
don't
recall
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
would
submit
that
even
though
the
statute
does
speak
about
prevailing
party
the
test
which
we
offer
to
the
court
is
one
which
--
does
allow
award
of
counsel
fees
to
the
prevailing
party
in
certain
kinds
of
cases
and
any
event
certain
standards
are
going
to
have
to
be
adopted.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
standard
that
we
have
proposed
to
the
court
is
one
which
would
best
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
law
that
the
test
that
judges
winter
and
sobeloff
have
proposed
were
to
some
extent
fulfill
that
purpose,
it
would
stop
the
interposition
of
defenses
which
increase
the
cost
of
litigation
and
essentially
increase
the
expense
of
the
plaintiff
but
would
not
illuminate
essentially
the
price
of
admission
which
is
at
least
to
visit
to
a
lawyer's
office
in
a
filing
of
a
lawsuit
and
perhaps
even
the
litigation
of
a
lawsuit
which
is
necessary,
would
be
necessary
if
the
winter-sobeloff
test
were
adopted.
mr.
jack
greenberg
then
i
would
say
that
the
winter-sobeloff
test
would
be
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
would
be
the
next
best
test
but
i
don't
feel
that
would
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
law
and
i
feel
that
if
there
were
a
plaintiff
and
there
could
be
who
would
want
to
bring
these
suits
just
for
--
to
oppress
and
the
test
that
we
would
propose
is
one
certainly
would
allow
awarding
counsel
fees
against
him.
but
that
is
hardly
like
be
the
case
but
it
could
occur.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
issue
is
the
correctness
of
the
standard
which
was
announced
by
the
fourth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
for
a
provision
of
title
2
of
the
united
states'
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
prove
--
the
public
accommodations
provision
which
provides
for
counsel
fees
in
public
accommodations
cases.
the
provision
is
on
page
2
of
our
brief
and
i
will
read
it,
it's
very
brief.
in
any
action
commenced
pursuant
to
this
subchapter
of
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
allow
the
prevailing
party
other
than
the
united
states
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs.
case
arose
in
the
following
way,
the
respondent
corporation
owns
six
restaurants
which
serve
southern
style
barbeque
various
locations
in
the
state
of
south
carolina,
five
of
these
restaurants
are
drive-ins,
one
is
a
sit
down
restaurant
in
downtown
columbia.
the
president
of
the
respondent
corporation
has
been
in
such
business
for
decades
and
has
called
himself
in
the
record
a
pioneer
in
the
drive-in
barbeque
business
in
south
carolina.
the
businesses
are
substantial
in
size,
food
purchases
are
in
excess
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
a
year
and
the
gross
volume
is
--
of
sales
is
obviously
in
excess
of
that.
five
of
the
six
restaurants
are
in
interstate
highways
and
all
of
them
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
policy
of
discrimination
was
followed
after
passage
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
after
decisions
of
this
court
uphold
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
the
answer
or
the
answers
filed
by
respondent
in
this
case
knew
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
asserted
that
they
were
incorrectly
decided.
the
plaintiffs
brought
suit
in
december
1964,
and
respondent
filed
an
answer
and
two
amended
answers,
one
in
february,
the
next
in
august
1965
and
the
third
in
march
1966.
these
answers
submitted
an
array
of
defenses.
first
of
all,
the
first
second
and
third
answer
denied
the
practice
of
racial
discrimination.
the
answers
denied,
they
served
interstate
travelers,
they
denied
that
they
served
the
substantial
amount
of
food
moving
in
commerce.
they
asserted
that
the
petitioner
had
a
constitutional
right
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
not
to
be
subjected
to
involuntary
servitude
and
serve
persons
against
his
will.
it
was
the
first
amendment
religious
privilege
claim
that
petitioner
asserted
that
his
religion
required
him
to
act
this
way.
there
was
an
equal
protection
and
due
process
claims
submitted
by
petitioners
and
then
there
was
a
claim
that
drive-in
restaurants
were
not
covered
by
the
1964
civil
rights
act
and
there
was
a
claim
that
i
mentioned
that
courts
were
not
foreclose
if
the
lower
court
is
not
foreclosed
by
decisions
of
this
court
because
those
decisions
were
wrong.
there
was
finally
a
well
over
a
year
following
the
filing
of
complaint,
a
trial
that
went
into
two
days
and
at
this
trial
the
plaintiff
proved
discrimination,
went
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
prove
that
the
food
which
was
served
in
the
restaurant
had
moved
in
interstate
commerce
and
indeed
we
have
not
printed
the
entire
record
in
order
to
spear
ourselves
in
the
court
but
more
than
a
hundred
pages
of
record
goes
into
one
of
the
origins
in
the
root
that
this
food
has
traveled
before
it
came
to
rest
in
the
drive-in
restaurants.
our
witness
who
testified
by
discrimination
the
other
witness
were
cross-examined
and
then
the
respondent
put
on
his
case
and
after
all
this,
the
respondent
did
admit
having
practiced
racial
discrimination
although
it
was
denied
in
three
answers
and
admitted
that
a
substantial
amount
of
food
had
actually
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
the
district
court
entered
an
order
that
one
of
the
restaurants
which
was
a
sit-down
restaurant
in
downtown
columbia
was
required
to
end
discrimination
under
the
1964
act.
it
said
that
the
drive-ins
were
not
covered
by
the
act
because
as
it
read
the
statutory
language
a
principle
part
of
the
food
served
--
principle
amount
of
the
food
served
was
not
served
for
consumption
on
the
premises
being
a
drive-in
and
people
would
drive
a
way
and
it
--
there
was
a
prayer
for
counsel
fees
which
is
the
issue
in
this
case
and
the
trial
court
held
simply
with
no
explanation
that
petitioner
were
not
entitled
to
counsel
fees.
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
question
of
whether
drive-ins
are
covered
by
the
1964
act
and
there
has
been
--
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
it
also
wrote
on
the
question
of
counsel
fees
page
165
of
the
record,
that
is
the
majority
of
the
court
did
that
in
exercising
its
discretion
the
district
court
may
properly
consider
whether
any
of
the
numerous
defenses
interposed
by
defendants
were
presented
for
purposes
of
delay
and
not
in
good
faith
but
the
test
should
be
and
this
is
what
the
court
termed
it,
a
subjective
one
for
no
litigant
ought
to
be
punished
under
the
guise
of
an
award
of
counsel
fees
or
in
any
other
manner
from
taking
a
position
in
court
in
which
he
honestly
believes
however
lacking
in
merit
that
position
may
be.
the
court
also
--
may
also
consider
whether
defendants
acted
in
good
faith
in
denying
discrimination.
judge
winter
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
on
the
counsel
fees
as
long
as
judge
sobeloff
adjoined
which
disagreed
with
the
majority
standard
and
judge
winter
wrote
good
faith
standing
alone
should
not
always
immunize
the
defendant
from
an
award
against
him.
specifically
in
this
case
defendants
are
not
entitled
to
the
defense
good
faith
and
regard
to
the
major
portion
of
their
defenses.
and
that
the
district
court
should
be
instructed
to
make
an
allowance
in
regard
to
some
of
defendant's
defenses
and
in
its
discretion
to
consider
an
allowance
for
the
remainder
of
defendant's
defenses
depending
upon
its
determination
of
defendant's
good
faith
and
honest
belief.
we
submit
that
the
majority
of
the
court
interpreted
the
counsel
fee
provision
of
the
1964
act
incorrectly
and
we
also
submit
that
the
minority
test
while
it
might
to
some
extent
forward
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
be
consonant
with
the
act
is
also
not
the
test
which
this
court
should
adopt
as
a
proper
standard
for
awarding
counsel
fees
in
public
accommodations,
title
2
cases.
the
generality,
the
very
generality
of
the
provision
obviously
leaves
it
to
the
courts
to
announce
and
develop
standards.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
no
monitory
amount.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
there
is
--
by
sealing,
you
mean
how
much
money
can
be
awarded?
the
statute
says
nothing
and
i
would
assume
that
the
lower
courts
would
use
the
ordinary
standards
that
they
do
in
a
variety
of
cases
in
which
counsel
fees
are
awarded
and
those
standards
depend
upon
a
good
number
of
factors.
the
amount
of
time
put
in
bar
associations
standards,
what
opposing
counsel
has
been
paid
and
various
matters
of
that
sort.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
was
remand
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
award
counsel
fees
according
to
a
subjective
test
standing.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
true.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
test
has
not
been
applied
by
the
district
court
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
if
it
were
applied
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
if
it
were
applied,
it
would
be
difficult
to
know
first
of
all
how
petitioners
could
meet
that
subjective
test,
how
petitioners
could
prove
what
went
on
in
the
mind
of
respondent
particularly
reminder
--
mind
of
respondent,
a
corporation.
and
then
secondly,
whether
the
amount
of
counsel
fees
awarded
under
that
test
would
be
less
than
the
amount
awarded
under
either
judge
winter's
and
sobeloff's
test
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
or
the
test
that
we
are
proposing
here,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
might
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
possible
but
so
--
at
least
so
far
as
petitioners
are
concerned
in
arguing
of
making
a
presentation
to
the
court
as
to
what
counsel
fees
should
be.
petitioners
would
be
at
a
disadvantage
almost
to
the
point
of
finding
themselves
in
an
impossible
position
as
to
request
counsel
fees
on
a
subjective
test
standard.
our
position
is
that
congress
did
more
than
codify
the
preexisting
law
of
equity.
obviously
under
existing
standards
without
the
statute
counsel
fees
have
been
awarded
though
not
frequently
in
litigation
generally
and
in
some
few
civil
rights
cases.
they've
been
awarded
as
in
the
rolex
case
or
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
a
party
has
acted
unconscionably
or
vexatiously
or
perhaps
presented
frivolous
defenses.
but
we
submit
that
the
key
factors
in
this
case
ought
to
be
those
which
carry
out
the
broad
remedial
purposes
of
title
2
after
all
title
2
was
a
great
innovation
in
american
law,
its
purpose
was
for
the
first
time
to
make
public
accommodations
available
to
all
americans
without
regard
to
race
throughout
the
country.
that
purpose
could
be
achieved
in
a
variety
of
ways
the
most
desirable
way
would
be
voluntary
compliance.
thereafter,
the
next
most
desirable
way
would
be
some
sort
of
judicial
compulsion
which
would
encourage
the
greatest
degree
of
voluntary
compliance.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
statute
says
prevailing
party
and
that
would
be
possible.
the
standard
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that's
not
happen.
the
standard
that
we
would
propose
would
be
that
whereas
in
all
cases
in
which
the
plaintiff
prevails
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
fees
cases
in
which
he
loses
counsel
fees
ought
not
to
be
assessed
against
him
unless
he
acted
for
purpose
of
harassment
or
in
bad
faith
or
in
some
other
way
which
is
so
unusual
is
not
likely
to
occur
because
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
encourage
compliance
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
it
would
not
be
--
put
it
bluntly,
it
would
not
be
a
two-way
street
under
the
standard
we
proposed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
would
be
assessed
in
any
action
which
the
plaintiff
prevail.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
unless,
it
would
be
so
unusual
an
action
if
there
were
no
reason
at
all
where
the
action
should've
been
brought
for
example
there
were
an
offer
of
judgment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
and
the
reason
is
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
if
the
standard
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
if
that
were
not
the
standard
there
would
be
essentially
a
price
of
admission
to
any
restaurant
which
is
that
you've
got
to
at
least
go
to
the
point
of
following
a
lawsuit
in
order
to
get
into
a
restaurant.
if
the
restaurant
were
decides
that
he
wants
to
maintain
a
policy
of
discrimination
and
we
submit
that
would
not
advance
the
policy
of
the
statute
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
situations
in
which
plaintiffs
are
likely
to
bring
lawsuits
for
any
purpose
other
than
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
secure
admission
to
a
restaurant,
a
hotel
or
anything
of
the
sort.
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
conceive
of
situations
and
indeed
there
are
situations
in
which
defendants
have
said
essentially
okay,
if
you
like
to
get
in
to
this
place
sue
me
and
that
means
essentially
the
plaintiff
has
to
at
least
employ
a
lawyer
and
pay
some
sort
of
a
fee
and
even
if
at
that
point
the
defendant
puts
up
a
non-frivolous
defense
and
or
even
essentially
then
entered
--
or
it
makes
an
offer
of
judgment.
the
plaintiff
has
at
least
had
to
pay
the
cost
of
seeing
a
lawyer
for
an
initial
visit
and
that
ought
not
to
be
the
ticket
of
admission
we
say
to
a
public
accommodation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
are
--
there
is
some
very
slight
legislative
history,
it
tends
to
point
away
from
the
subjective
test
it
has
set
forth
in
our
certiorari
petition
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief
and
it
essentially
talks
about
frivolity
but
it's
not
--
it
really
is
not
very,
very
extensive.
essentially
the
matter
has
really
been
left
to
the
courts
to
interpret
and
we
would
submit
that
it
ought
to
be
interpreted
in
order
to
carry
out
the
general
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
there
has
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
has
not
been
till
now
as
i
know
a
fee
in
a
title
2
case.
there
has
--
(inaudible),
he
knows
the
fee.
well,
the
--
no
one
has
given
me
a
dollar
amount.
all
they
tell
me
is
what
i
did
know,
the
fees
are
moderate
several
hundred
dollars
in
cases
of
this
sort.
i
do
know
that
there
has
been
a
major
title
7
litigation
in
which
counsel
fees
were
allowed
in
the
--
in
virginia
and
richmond
involving
--
that
was
a
quite
a
major
case
involving
this
defendants
the
philip
morris
corporation
and
the
american
--
and
the
tobacco
workers
union.
and
the
court
awarded
counsel
fees
and
parties
then
negotiated
the
fees
between
themselves
and
came
to
an
agreement
and
that
isn't
a
matter
of
several
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
but
that
was
quite
a
major
lawsuit.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
cases
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'm
not
--
i
am
not
asking
the
court
lay
down
the
general
rule
as
to
the
amount
of
fees.
i
think
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
that
the
stand
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
that
for
types
of
litigation
there
are
standards
for
example
an
ordinary
school
desegregation
case.
the
standard
as
of
this
point
seems
to
be
that
if
the
defendant
has
dragged
up
a
litigation
has
interposed
a
lot
of
dilatory
defenses
has
put
the
plaintiff
to
a
great
deal
of
troubles
some
courts
have
awarded
counsel
fees
in
those
situations.
in
other
cases,
the
general
rule
has
been
one
which
turns
upon
the
extent
to
which
a
party
has
acted
vexatiously
but
this
a
statutory
provision,
the
statute
essentially
says
that
counsel
fees
ought
to
be
allowable
and
the
question
now
was,
what
standard
should
the
court
device
to
carry
out
not
only
that
purpose
of
the
statute,
not
into
the
statute
but
the
general
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
my
position.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
that,
i
think
that
discretion
in
this
context
ought
to
be
read
as
in
other
context
that
it
ought
to
be
according
to
some
standards
not
to
unfetter
unbridled
discretion.
and
even
according
to
standard
that
i
have
given
if
discretion
is
used
pursuant
to
implement
that
standard
it
would
not
ordinarily
be
reviewed.
second,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that's
not
the
only
standard.
there
are
cases
in
which
let
us
say
a
plaintiff
might've
acted
for
purposes
of
harassment
or
may
have
for
example
could've
won
his
case
in
a
rather
simple
way
but
went
to
a
great
deal
trouble
to
just
multiply
the
record
and
in
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
that's
comparable
with
the
language
and
certainly
with
the
purpose
but
i
think
the
word
“discretion”
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
the
word
“discretion”
i
think
also
should
be
read
as
to
going
to
amount
as
distinguished
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
an
award.
mr.
jack
greenberg
certainly
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
certainly
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
certainly
not
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
that
certainly
was
not
--
certainly
not
this
case.
now,
the
alternatives
are
that
if
a
plaintiff
wants
to
bring
a
suit
and
as
our
brief
indicates
there
are
hundreds
or
thousands
of
establishments
and
not
the
large
institutions
like
the
big
chain
hotels
but
this
smaller
place
that
do
discriminate
that
if
a
plaintiff
wants
to
bring
a
suit
either
has
to
be
able
to
afford
some
fee
for
lawyer
which
a
typical
plaintiff
would
not
have.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
two
of
them
were
students
and
another
one
was
an
nnacp
executive
secretary.
or
he
would
have
to
go
a
civil
rights
organization
and
none
of
them
are
capable
of
bringing
the
large
number
of
suits
that
are
necessary
or
to
the
department
of
justice
which
also
must
has
been
the
three
sources
or
else
he
may
bring
no
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
jack
greenberg
depends
what
you're
measuring,
the
plaintiff
lose
is
to
five
out
of
six
restaurants
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
but
he
won
in
all
the
legal
issues
and
all
of
evidentiary
issues
except
one
which
the
question
of
whether
or
not
drive-ins
are
covered
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
the
court
of
appeals
that
that
was
mistaken
so
he
really
ended
winning
six
out
of
six.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
there
are
appellate
proceedings.
mr.
jack
greenberg
many
of
these
cases
it
is
found
that
once
the
case
is
filed
and
there
are
some
movement
towards
litigation,
the
establishment
which
is
discriminating
will
cease
discrimination
but
nevertheless
the
plaintiff
for
somebody
has
department
of
justice's
civil
rights
organization
has
had
to
buy
the
ticket
of
admission
which
is
a
visit
to
the
lawyer's
office
filing
of
a
complaint
and
so
forth.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
are
some
other
federal
statutes
that
provide
for
counsel
fees.
the
sherman
act,
clayton
act
for
example
provide
for
counsel
fees
but
that
is
rather
explicit,
it
says,
in
fact
i
was
about
come
to
that
and
i
was
going
to
say
that
if
respondent
had
counsel
argument
here
today
he
might
argue
that
if
congress
had
intended
that
a
provision
like
the
provision
in
the
clayton
act
--
the
sherman
act
applied
would've
said
so
explicitly
rather
than
use
the
general
kind
of
language
that
it
used.
but
it's
--
i
don't
think
it's
unusual
for
congress
to
leave
aspects
of
enforcement
and
interpretation
in
flushing
out
of
various
statutes
to
the
courts
and
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that's
apparently
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
language
is
very
general
and
if
it's
to
be
interpreted
we
would
submit
that
in
order
to
be
interpreted
to
affect
the
purposes
of
the
statute
it
has
to
be
interpreted
along
with
other
provisions
and
doctrines
that
it
affect
the
award
of
counsel
fees
but
those
go
over
of
variety
if
they
are
essentially
in
two
categories
goes
on
which
the
plaintiff
is
vindicating
the
public
right
and
those
which
the
plaintiff
is
vindicating
his
own
private
right
as
a
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
some
of
the
sherman
act
is
explicit.
i
am
--
i
have
some
of
the
other
ones
here
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
--
let's
see
i
have
some
of
them
here.
as
i
have
said
the
sherman
act
is
explicit,
this
court
last
year
had
a
case
under
the
trade
mark
statute
here
and
which
the
term
“counsel
fee”
is
not
used
at
all,
this
question
of
interpretation
of
cost,
the
courts
said,
“well,
that
did
not
include
counsel
fees.”
in
--
there
was
a
case
last
term
involving
rights
of
a
seaman
and
it
was
held
that
counsel
fees
ought
to
be
awarded.
as
of
subject
statute
form
in
two
categories,
those
in
which
the
plaintiff
is
asserting
a
public
right
as
a
sherman
act
case
and
this
kind
of
case
where
the
plaintiffs
is
asserting
a
public
right
after
all
when
he
wins
the
case
it's
hardly
worth
several
hundred
dollars
to
him
just
to
purchase
a
single
dinner
certainly
not
in
a
monetary
sense
but
he's
essentially
won
something
for
the
entire
community
and
we
submit
that
this
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
it
did
but
it
didn't
say
in
what
instances
i
mean
even
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
prevailing
party
in
some
situations
and
as
to
some
issues
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
honestly
don't
recall
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
would
submit
that
even
though
the
statute
does
speak
about
prevailing
party
the
test
which
we
offer
to
the
court
is
one
which
--
does
allow
award
of
counsel
fees
to
the
prevailing
party
in
certain
kinds
of
cases
and
any
event
certain
standards
are
going
to
have
to
be
adopted.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
standard
that
we
have
proposed
to
the
court
is
one
which
would
best
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
law
that
the
test
that
judges
winter
and
sobeloff
have
proposed
were
to
some
extent
fulfill
that
purpose,
it
would
stop
the
interposition
of
defenses
which
increase
the
cost
of
litigation
and
essentially
increase
the
expense
of
the
plaintiff
but
would
not
illuminate
essentially
the
price
of
admission
which
is
at
least
to
visit
to
a
lawyer's
office
in
a
filing
of
a
lawsuit
and
perhaps
even
the
litigation
of
a
lawsuit
which
is
necessary,
would
be
necessary
if
the
winter-sobeloff
test
were
adopted.
mr.
jack
greenberg
then
i
would
say
that
the
winter-sobeloff
test
would
be
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
would
be
the
next
best
test
but
i
don't
feel
that
would
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
law
and
i
feel
that
if
there
were
a
plaintiff
and
there
could
be
who
would
want
to
bring
these
suits
just
for
--
to
oppress
and
the
test
that
we
would
propose
is
one
certainly
would
allow
awarding
counsel
fees
against
him.
but
that
is
hardly
like
be
the
case
but
it
could
occur.
