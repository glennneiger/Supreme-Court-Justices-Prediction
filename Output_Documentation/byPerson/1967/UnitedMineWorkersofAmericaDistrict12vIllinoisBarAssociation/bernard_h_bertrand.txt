mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
would,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
order
to
start
on
even
keel
here
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
with
respect
to
a
possible
misunderstanding
that
the
court
may
have
with
respect
to
disciplinary
actions
against
mr.
stewart
trainer.
as
regards
of
this
particular
problem
here
mr.
stewart
trainer
has
no
disciplinary
action
pending
against
him.
in
other
words
with
respect
to
aiding
and
abetting
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
by
a
way
of
agency.
however
and
i
must
go
outside
the
record,
if
the
court
would
permit
me.
there
is
a
disciplinary
action
pending
against
mr.
trainer
who
is
no
longer
a
state
senator
and
it
is
on
totally
unrelated
matter
and
he
no
longer
represents
the
union.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
i
only
wanted
to
clear
the
fact
that
you
asked
the
question
mr.
chief
justice,
oh
i'm
sorry.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well,
i
didn't
wanted
to
have
any
correction
that
it
was
from
this
proceeding
that
there
was
a
disciplinary
action
and
that
is
what
the
mr.
combs
indicated.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
because
the
matter
never
was
brought
to
the
attention
to
the
unauthorized
practice
committee
by
anyone
making
a
complaint.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
the
complainant
here
originally
was
in
some
1957,
a
lawyer
from
west
frankfort,
illinois.
and
he
made
it
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
his
complaint
was
that
the
present
man
who
was
his
predecessor
mr.
trainer
was
engaged
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
in
being
a
salaried
employer
for
the
union
and
that
was
taken
up
by
the
bar
association
at
that
time
and
through
developments
it
finally
reached
it's
--
the
point
to
where
we
file
a
suit
at
the
approval
of
the
bar
association.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
at
least
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no,
the
problem
of
unauthorized
practice
by
the
salaried
lawyer
is
10
years
old.
the
previous
lawyer
who
handled
this
matter
was
a
man
hannigan,
and
it
is
mentioned
in
the
brief
and
in
the
record.
and
he
was
a
man
who
at
that
time
--
shortly
after
the
time
the
investigation
began
became
ill
and
apparently
our
predecessor
committee
did
not
want
to
push
the
matter
because
he
was
apparently
very
seriously
ill
and
it,
he
eventually
as
court
realized
died
and
this
man
took
this
place,
and
it
was
at
that
stage
that
the
more
active
participation
occurred.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
perhaps
true,
yes
your
honor,
there
has
never
been
any
matter
brought
directly
to
the
state
bar
on
--
that
is
correct.
however
that
in
and
of
itself
is
not
reason
why
the
state
bar
shouldn't
act
when
it
has
brought
to
its
attention
a
plan
such
as
this
one
which
does
not
guarantee
to
the
individual
minor,
confident
and
loyal
legal
representation
as
they
claim.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes,
miners
have
complained
to
the
extent--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well,
these
complaints
occurred
after
the
bar
association
started,
this
proceedings
and
before
and
after
actually
the
interrogatories
were
made
and
filed
and
after
the
deposition
of
the
mr.
stewart
trainer
and
it
was
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings
that
the
mine
workers,
united
mine
workers
district
12
came
in
and
asked
for
a
summary
judgment
and
we
in
turn
filed
our
motion
for
summary
decree
and
as
the
court
considered
both
motions.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
active
complaints
known
to
the
bar.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
one
made
any
official
complaint,
but
it
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
among
lawyers
practicing
before
the
compensation
commission
of
the
manner,
the
wholesale
manner
in
which
this
was
handled
by
the
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
was
part
of
their
complaints,
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
here
was
a
man
that
saw
these
miners
--
the
day
of
the
occurrence,
of
the
day
of
the
hearing
i
should
say,
and
for
the
first
time
that
they
did
that
the
man
who
represented
the
miners
did
not
handle
the
case
like
other
people
who
have
cases
before
the
compensation
commission.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes,
i
know
many
handled
the
same
cases
the
same
way--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
justice
marshall,
yes
sir
in
a
manager
of
this
kind
i
think
it
would
be
quite
proper
and
quite
often
handled
that
once
they
get
the
report
from
their
company
doctor,
they
would
then
send
that
man
to
an
independent
doctor
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes,
that's
true,
that's
part
of
it
is.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
there
was
no
official
written
complaint.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
first
instance
was
the
illness
of
mr.
hannigan,
it
was
pushed
aside
by
the
then
members
of
the
unauthorized
practice
commission
because
the
man
was
apparently
having
a
condition
which,
from
which
he,
it
was
expected
he
would
die.
they
did
not
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
it
was
delayed
from
1957
and
1959
till
about
‘63
when
mr.
trainer
took
over
and
then
–
and
incidentally
in
that
period
before
that
mr.
chief
justice
there
was
a
period
of
time
where
mr.
hannigan
was
interrogated
by
the
committee
and
the
same
general
information
that
appears
in
the
deposition
of
mr.
trainer
came
out
at
that
time.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
he
was
working
--
he
was
working
as
best
he
could
under
the
circumstances
of
his
condition
and
i
believe
he
used
his
son
to
help
him.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
this
of
course
i
agree
but
it
was
never
brought
too
ahead
due
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
certain
humanitarian
feeling
towards
mr.
hannigan,
they
did
not
want
to
do
anything
at
that
time
that
would
make
him,
would
worsen
his
condition.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes
sir,
he
died
and
that
is
the
reason
why
mr.
trainer
was
replaced,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
an
interim
of
some
four
or
five
months
his
son
acted
as
the
mine
workers
attorney
and
received
his
salary.
the
problem
--
the
state
of
illinois
is
confronted
with
a
case
of
this
kind
is
the
plan
itself
clearly
showed
that
the
miners,
please
understand
that
as
far
as
the
illinois
state
bar
association
is
concerned
our
interest
here
is
the
public
interest
and
the
public
in
this
case
has
to
be
the
individual
miner
and
it
became
quite
evident
from
the
record
that
here
is
a
man
who
concludes
450
some
cases
a
year
that
he
was
not
doing
the
job
that
an
person
should
do
for
those
people
--
because
that
is
almost
an
insurmountable
number
of
cases
to
handle
if
you
are
going
to
handle
them
properly.
he
testified
under
those
in
his
deposition
that
he
seldom
saw
these
people
before
the
hearing
--
that
he
only
took
them
at
the
hearing
and
then
i
suppose
he
took
the,
well
your
company
doctor
says
you
have
10%
of
your
life
so
therefore
we'll
try
and
get
10%
of
the
life.
he
never
made
any
attempt
except
in
rare
instances
which
he
admits,
rare
instances
--
did
he
go
and
find
out
whether
or
not
that
company
doctor
was
actually
correct
on
that
10%
life
or
maybe
it
might
have
be
70%
of
the
life.
he
didn't
do
any
of
the
things
that
a
true
individual
attorney
client
relationship
would
dictate
to
any
lawyer.
he
did
this
on
a
mass
basis.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
justice
fortas
–
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
we
--
the
illinois
state
supreme
court
in
in
re
brotherhood
of
trainmen
set
that
pattern.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
our
objection
is
–
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
our
position
is
that,
our
position
is
that
when
you
make
the
jump
from
mere
recommendation
to
the
employment
of
a
lawyer,
then
you
insert
that
particular
union
or
that
particular
agency
into
the
practice
of
law
and
you
clove
that
union
with
the
practice
of
law
which
is
prohibited
and
the
state
of
illinois
has
the
right
to
regulate
the
practice.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
the
record
shows
that
he
had
people,
members
of
the
union
who
took
these
reports
of
actions,
who
sought
that
the
man
had
a
medical
examination
by
the
company
doctor
--
that
the
international
secretary,
the
local
stewards,
the
three
or
four
secretaries
of
the
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
not
in
that
specific
step,
no
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
would
say
that
it
shows
it
by
indirection,
by
the
virtue
of
the
number
of
cases
that
he
had,
but
it
doesn't
show
it
directly.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can
only
say
that
the
beginning
of
this
occurred
before
my
tenure
on
the
unauthorized
practice
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no,
no
i
am
just
saying
that
that
occurred
beforehand
and
then
when
--
during
my
time
on
the
committee,
the
present
developments
occurred
with
respect
to
mr.
steward
training.
it
was
anticipated
that
these
elements
of
the
improper
and
insufficient
representation
would
be
further
developed
in
this
case,
in
the
preparation
of
the
case
before
it
actually
reached
the
trial
stage.
but
the
union
interposed
this
motion
for
summary
decree.
at
that
time
perhaps
as
not
as
able
to
look
ahead
and
see
what
there
is
available
to
one,
we
likewise
file
such
a
motion
and
both
motions
were
heard
on
the
state
of
the
record
at
that
time
and
the
court
then
determined
from
the
state
of
the
record
at
that
time
that
there
was
evidence
of
unauthorized
practice
by
the
district
lawyer.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
don't
know,
it
did
not
other
than
the
fact
that
from
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no,
no
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
when
did
i
come
into
the
case?
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
in
1963
i
believe.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yeah.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
in
an
informal
way
yes.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
not
specific
but
general,
from
general
conversation
with
parties
including
attorneys
who
represented
the
coal
companies.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
because
i
felt
that
the
time
had
transpired,
the
decree
was
entered
before
i
could
get
any
of
that
into
the
record.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
the
decree
was
entered
in
19
--
i
don't
have
the
exact
date
your
honor.
1964,
it
was
about
september
of
1964.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
think
it
isn't.
first
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no.
i
think
that
the
main
point
in
this
case
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
is
the
fact
that
we
have
a
compelling
state
interest
to
control
the
practice
of
law
and
insofar
as
the
practice
of
law
is
concerned,
the
manner
in
which
the
man
handles
the
business
is
only
one
facet
of
the
control.
there
are
many
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
i
don't
think
it
does,
other
than
the
sense
that
the
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
--.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
think
you
have
to
consider
in
order
to
consider
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
think
i'd
make
the
same
argument.
i'd
have
to.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
you
have
the
same
evil
of
being
a
lay
agency
interfering
with
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
--
my
judgment
is
the
basic
element
of
the
case.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no,
there
isn't
--
they
either
control
him
or
have
the
right
to
control
him
and
they
could
use
the
influence
of
their
organization
to
control
them
and
so
therefore
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
it
is
my
intention
mr.
justice
black
that
this
isn't
a
federal
question
at
all.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
i
can
for
this
simple
reason,
because
in
that
case
there
was,
as
has
been
time
and
time
repeated,
this
was
a
case
of
political
expression
and
in
that
case
the
opinion
itself,
the
opinion
stated
sir
that
this
was
different
than
private
disputes.
this
was
not
a
matter
of
private
disputes,
and
this
is
a
matter
of
a
private
dispute
between
the
member
of
the
union.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
it
did
not,
it
left
it
open.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
then
if
you
take
the
virginia
brotherhood
case,
you
will
find
there
that
the
court
stated
there
that
the
members
had
the
right
to
discuss
within
themselves
and
to
pick
a
representative,
to
recommend
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
the
issue
presented
in
the
brotherhood
case
was
clearly
that
virginia
wouldn't
let
the
brotherhood
getaway
with
a
recommendation
for
--
approach.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no.
no.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
justice
white,
i
find
no
difference
between
a
salaried
employer
and
a
person
on
retain.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
correct.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
on
the
contrary
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
is
a
question
which
you
have
raised
is
a
question
of
taking
care
of
the
need
of
indigents.
the
united
mine
workers
district
club
members
are
by
no
means
indigents.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
i
submit
that
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
but
the
bar
of
illinois
and
the
bar
throughout
this
country
did
not
object
to
the
oeo
program
for
the
indigent.
they
accepted--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
right.
but
there
is
an
entire
difference
between
that
type
of
representation
and
the
representation
for
a
person
who
is
a
salaried
employee,
a
person
who
is
making
money
and
who
has
a
claim
for
some
injury
that
he
received,
this
is
an
entirely
different
status
and
the
bar
has
never
stated
that
every
human
being
is
entitled
to
representation
if
they
belong
to
an
agency.
now
this
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
chief
justice,
yes
i
do.
i
think
that
is
correct,
that
there's
that
difference.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
if
he
--
again
i
have
to
say
that's
the
same
thing.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
same
thing.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well,
he
became
indigent
perhaps
after
that
particular
occurrence
if
you
might
say,
maybe
he
didn't
i
don't
know
what
the
situation
maybe
from
his
injury
that
he
received
as
a
minor
but
that
does
not
put
him
over
into
the
class
of
the
indigent
before
the
event
by
any
manner
or
means
and
it
would
have
to
be
the
most
serious
type
of
situation
that
you
could
call
him
then
an
indigent.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
because
there's
a
protection
of
employment
that
he
had
in
one
instance
as
opposed
to
the
other.
i
would
say
that
would
possibly
be
one
of
the
answer
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
then
wasn't
necessarily
an
indigent.
he
became
poor
by
virtue
of
the
fact
he
may
not
been
able
to
work
but
in
the
case
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
but
in
the
minor
situation
he
has
of
course
the
protection
of
the
collective
bargaining
arrangements
and
the
welfare
program
of
his
union.
this
brings
to
the
question,
the
problem
that
is
raised
by
the
amicus
briefs.
i
think
that
the
question
of
group
legal
service
here
is
something
that
if
the
bar
is
to
or
to
look
forward
to
the
potentiality
of
group
legal
service
in
our
society,
we're
going
to
have
such
a
situation
that
there
will
be
no
control
of
lawyers,
there
will
be
the
situation
that
i
have
brought
to
the
court's
attention
in
the
objections
of
where
you've
been
advertised
willy-nilly
to
the
particular
group
that
you
represent
instead
of
having
just
unions
and
laboring
people
being
represented.
you
will
have
the
airline
pilots
association,
they
could
have
all
of
their
individual
matters
taken
care
of
by
their
salaried
lawyer,
the
american
manufacturers
association,
the
illinois
manufacturers
association.
all
of
their
various
potential
litigated
matters
or
legal
matters
will
trust
anything
of
that
nature,
taken
care
of
by
a
group
arrangement.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
and
i
would
say
that
illinois
is
a
forward-looking
bar
association
because
it
does
engage
in
that
type
of
procedure,
there's
a
large
legal
aid
bureau
in
chicago.
there
are
many
legal
aid
groups
throughout
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
because
there
the
people
are
in
need
of
legal
assistance
and
they
don't
have
the
means
to
get
it.
they
are
not
necessarily
in
the
absolute
impoverished
state
but
they
are
in
that
nebulous
state
where
they
don't
quite
have
enough
money
or
they
don't
quite
know
what
to
do
with
some
of
their
problems
that
are
bothering
them
and
this
is
a
perfect
place
for
them
to
go.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
of
course
mr.
chief
justice
i
say
that
that's
the
extreme
i
mean
we
--
i
claim
that
that's
the
extreme
that
they
can't.
when
you
become
ill
you
can't
pay
the
medical
and
when
you
have
a
legal
problem,
you
can't
pay
the
legal
fees,
those
are
the
extremes.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
correct.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
categorize
them
of
course
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
but
it
was
found
there
was
a
need
to
legal
aid
societies,
lawyer
reference
services
were
established
and
the
bar
has
done
a
great
service
to
the
public
by
being
involved
in
all
those
things.
but
what
we're
dealing
here
in
this
case
is
with
an
organization
that
has
members
who
are
not
impoverished.
the
state
of
illinois
is
the
fourth
largest
coal
producing
state
in
the
country.
it
has
a
tremendous
potential
of
employment
within
the
coal
field.
there
are
some
new
developments
in
the
coal
field,
that
are
just
occurring
right
at
the
present
time
and
these
are
going
to
mean
more
employment
for
the
union
member.
recently
the,
one
of
the
amicus
put
out
a
poll
to
try
and
find
out
just
what
type
of
person
the
union
member
was
and
the
affl-cio
found
out
that
their
member
is
the
type
of
person
who
goes
to
work,
from
work
to
his
home
in
the
suburbs
and
sits
in
his
backyard
with
a
highball
in
his
hand
and
complaints
about
high
taxes.
he
is
no
longer
the
indigent,
he
is
no
longer
the
poor
fellow,
he's
no
longer
the
fellow
who
lives
in
the
poor
areas
of
the
city.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
appalachia
is
a
different
thing
what
occurs
in
appalachia
and
what
is
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
won't
say
no
because
if
you
remember
mr.
combs
informed
the
court
that
in
appalachia
in
west
virginia,
they
also
had
a
complaint
by
the
bar
association
and
they
sat
down
and
worked
it
out.
we
tried
to
get
the
minors
to
sit
down
and
work
this
out
with
us,
they
refused,
they
took
the
adamant
approach.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
we
wanted
them,
our
major
premise
was
we
wanted
them
to
follow
illinois
mineworker's
opinion
which
said
that
you
can
recommend
attorneys
whom
you
feel
to
be
competent;
we
wanted
them
to
do
that.
now,
there's
no
saying
that
we
would
not
have
perhaps
by
over
the
bargaining
table,
worked
out
something
that
in
the
judgment
of
the
committee
would
have
been
considered
a
proper
way
of
handling
the
union
members
business.
they
wouldn't
do
so
that's
why
we're
here.
thank
you,
very
much.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
would,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
order
to
start
on
even
keel
here
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
with
respect
to
a
possible
misunderstanding
that
the
court
may
have
with
respect
to
disciplinary
actions
against
mr.
stewart
trainer.
as
regards
of
this
particular
problem
here
mr.
stewart
trainer
has
no
disciplinary
action
pending
against
him.
in
other
words
with
respect
to
aiding
and
abetting
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
by
a
way
of
agency.
however
and
i
must
go
outside
the
record,
if
the
court
would
permit
me.
there
is
a
disciplinary
action
pending
against
mr.
trainer
who
is
no
longer
a
state
senator
and
it
is
on
totally
unrelated
matter
and
he
no
longer
represents
the
union.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
i
only
wanted
to
clear
the
fact
that
you
asked
the
question
mr.
chief
justice,
oh
i'm
sorry.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well,
i
didn't
wanted
to
have
any
correction
that
it
was
from
this
proceeding
that
there
was
a
disciplinary
action
and
that
is
what
the
mr.
combs
indicated.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
because
the
matter
never
was
brought
to
the
attention
to
the
unauthorized
practice
committee
by
anyone
making
a
complaint.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
the
complainant
here
originally
was
in
some
1957,
a
lawyer
from
west
frankfort,
illinois.
and
he
made
it
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
his
complaint
was
that
the
present
man
who
was
his
predecessor
mr.
trainer
was
engaged
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
in
being
a
salaried
employer
for
the
union
and
that
was
taken
up
by
the
bar
association
at
that
time
and
through
developments
it
finally
reached
it's
--
the
point
to
where
we
file
a
suit
at
the
approval
of
the
bar
association.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
at
least
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no,
the
problem
of
unauthorized
practice
by
the
salaried
lawyer
is
10
years
old.
the
previous
lawyer
who
handled
this
matter
was
a
man
hannigan,
and
it
is
mentioned
in
the
brief
and
in
the
record.
and
he
was
a
man
who
at
that
time
--
shortly
after
the
time
the
investigation
began
became
ill
and
apparently
our
predecessor
committee
did
not
want
to
push
the
matter
because
he
was
apparently
very
seriously
ill
and
it,
he
eventually
as
court
realized
died
and
this
man
took
this
place,
and
it
was
at
that
stage
that
the
more
active
participation
occurred.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
perhaps
true,
yes
your
honor,
there
has
never
been
any
matter
brought
directly
to
the
state
bar
on
--
that
is
correct.
however
that
in
and
of
itself
is
not
reason
why
the
state
bar
shouldn't
act
when
it
has
brought
to
its
attention
a
plan
such
as
this
one
which
does
not
guarantee
to
the
individual
minor,
confident
and
loyal
legal
representation
as
they
claim.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes,
miners
have
complained
to
the
extent--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well,
these
complaints
occurred
after
the
bar
association
started,
this
proceedings
and
before
and
after
actually
the
interrogatories
were
made
and
filed
and
after
the
deposition
of
the
mr.
stewart
trainer
and
it
was
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings
that
the
mine
workers,
united
mine
workers
district
12
came
in
and
asked
for
a
summary
judgment
and
we
in
turn
filed
our
motion
for
summary
decree
and
as
the
court
considered
both
motions.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
active
complaints
known
to
the
bar.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
one
made
any
official
complaint,
but
it
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
among
lawyers
practicing
before
the
compensation
commission
of
the
manner,
the
wholesale
manner
in
which
this
was
handled
by
the
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
was
part
of
their
complaints,
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
here
was
a
man
that
saw
these
miners
--
the
day
of
the
occurrence,
of
the
day
of
the
hearing
i
should
say,
and
for
the
first
time
that
they
did
that
the
man
who
represented
the
miners
did
not
handle
the
case
like
other
people
who
have
cases
before
the
compensation
commission.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes,
i
know
many
handled
the
same
cases
the
same
way--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
justice
marshall,
yes
sir
in
a
manager
of
this
kind
i
think
it
would
be
quite
proper
and
quite
often
handled
that
once
they
get
the
report
from
their
company
doctor,
they
would
then
send
that
man
to
an
independent
doctor
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes,
that's
true,
that's
part
of
it
is.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
there
was
no
official
written
complaint.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
first
instance
was
the
illness
of
mr.
hannigan,
it
was
pushed
aside
by
the
then
members
of
the
unauthorized
practice
commission
because
the
man
was
apparently
having
a
condition
which,
from
which
he,
it
was
expected
he
would
die.
they
did
not
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
it
was
delayed
from
1957
and
1959
till
about
‘63
when
mr.
trainer
took
over
and
then
–
and
incidentally
in
that
period
before
that
mr.
chief
justice
there
was
a
period
of
time
where
mr.
hannigan
was
interrogated
by
the
committee
and
the
same
general
information
that
appears
in
the
deposition
of
mr.
trainer
came
out
at
that
time.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
he
was
working
--
he
was
working
as
best
he
could
under
the
circumstances
of
his
condition
and
i
believe
he
used
his
son
to
help
him.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
this
of
course
i
agree
but
it
was
never
brought
too
ahead
due
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
certain
humanitarian
feeling
towards
mr.
hannigan,
they
did
not
want
to
do
anything
at
that
time
that
would
make
him,
would
worsen
his
condition.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes
sir,
he
died
and
that
is
the
reason
why
mr.
trainer
was
replaced,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
an
interim
of
some
four
or
five
months
his
son
acted
as
the
mine
workers
attorney
and
received
his
salary.
the
problem
--
the
state
of
illinois
is
confronted
with
a
case
of
this
kind
is
the
plan
itself
clearly
showed
that
the
miners,
please
understand
that
as
far
as
the
illinois
state
bar
association
is
concerned
our
interest
here
is
the
public
interest
and
the
public
in
this
case
has
to
be
the
individual
miner
and
it
became
quite
evident
from
the
record
that
here
is
a
man
who
concludes
450
some
cases
a
year
that
he
was
not
doing
the
job
that
an
person
should
do
for
those
people
--
because
that
is
almost
an
insurmountable
number
of
cases
to
handle
if
you
are
going
to
handle
them
properly.
he
testified
under
those
in
his
deposition
that
he
seldom
saw
these
people
before
the
hearing
--
that
he
only
took
them
at
the
hearing
and
then
i
suppose
he
took
the,
well
your
company
doctor
says
you
have
10%
of
your
life
so
therefore
we'll
try
and
get
10%
of
the
life.
he
never
made
any
attempt
except
in
rare
instances
which
he
admits,
rare
instances
--
did
he
go
and
find
out
whether
or
not
that
company
doctor
was
actually
correct
on
that
10%
life
or
maybe
it
might
have
be
70%
of
the
life.
he
didn't
do
any
of
the
things
that
a
true
individual
attorney
client
relationship
would
dictate
to
any
lawyer.
he
did
this
on
a
mass
basis.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
justice
fortas
–
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
we
--
the
illinois
state
supreme
court
in
in
re
brotherhood
of
trainmen
set
that
pattern.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
our
objection
is
–
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
our
position
is
that,
our
position
is
that
when
you
make
the
jump
from
mere
recommendation
to
the
employment
of
a
lawyer,
then
you
insert
that
particular
union
or
that
particular
agency
into
the
practice
of
law
and
you
clove
that
union
with
the
practice
of
law
which
is
prohibited
and
the
state
of
illinois
has
the
right
to
regulate
the
practice.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
the
record
shows
that
he
had
people,
members
of
the
union
who
took
these
reports
of
actions,
who
sought
that
the
man
had
a
medical
examination
by
the
company
doctor
--
that
the
international
secretary,
the
local
stewards,
the
three
or
four
secretaries
of
the
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
not
in
that
specific
step,
no
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
would
say
that
it
shows
it
by
indirection,
by
the
virtue
of
the
number
of
cases
that
he
had,
but
it
doesn't
show
it
directly.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can
only
say
that
the
beginning
of
this
occurred
before
my
tenure
on
the
unauthorized
practice
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no,
no
i
am
just
saying
that
that
occurred
beforehand
and
then
when
--
during
my
time
on
the
committee,
the
present
developments
occurred
with
respect
to
mr.
steward
training.
it
was
anticipated
that
these
elements
of
the
improper
and
insufficient
representation
would
be
further
developed
in
this
case,
in
the
preparation
of
the
case
before
it
actually
reached
the
trial
stage.
but
the
union
interposed
this
motion
for
summary
decree.
at
that
time
perhaps
as
not
as
able
to
look
ahead
and
see
what
there
is
available
to
one,
we
likewise
file
such
a
motion
and
both
motions
were
heard
on
the
state
of
the
record
at
that
time
and
the
court
then
determined
from
the
state
of
the
record
at
that
time
that
there
was
evidence
of
unauthorized
practice
by
the
district
lawyer.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
don't
know,
it
did
not
other
than
the
fact
that
from
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no,
no
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
when
did
i
come
into
the
case?
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
in
1963
i
believe.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yeah.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
in
an
informal
way
yes.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
not
specific
but
general,
from
general
conversation
with
parties
including
attorneys
who
represented
the
coal
companies.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
because
i
felt
that
the
time
had
transpired,
the
decree
was
entered
before
i
could
get
any
of
that
into
the
record.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
the
decree
was
entered
in
19
--
i
don't
have
the
exact
date
your
honor.
1964,
it
was
about
september
of
1964.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
think
it
isn't.
first
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no.
i
think
that
the
main
point
in
this
case
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
is
the
fact
that
we
have
a
compelling
state
interest
to
control
the
practice
of
law
and
insofar
as
the
practice
of
law
is
concerned,
the
manner
in
which
the
man
handles
the
business
is
only
one
facet
of
the
control.
there
are
many
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
i
don't
think
it
does,
other
than
the
sense
that
the
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
--.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
think
you
have
to
consider
in
order
to
consider
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
think
i'd
make
the
same
argument.
i'd
have
to.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
you
have
the
same
evil
of
being
a
lay
agency
interfering
with
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
--
my
judgment
is
the
basic
element
of
the
case.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no,
there
isn't
--
they
either
control
him
or
have
the
right
to
control
him
and
they
could
use
the
influence
of
their
organization
to
control
them
and
so
therefore
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
it
is
my
intention
mr.
justice
black
that
this
isn't
a
federal
question
at
all.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
yes.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
i
can
for
this
simple
reason,
because
in
that
case
there
was,
as
has
been
time
and
time
repeated,
this
was
a
case
of
political
expression
and
in
that
case
the
opinion
itself,
the
opinion
stated
sir
that
this
was
different
than
private
disputes.
this
was
not
a
matter
of
private
disputes,
and
this
is
a
matter
of
a
private
dispute
between
the
member
of
the
union.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no
it
did
not,
it
left
it
open.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
then
if
you
take
the
virginia
brotherhood
case,
you
will
find
there
that
the
court
stated
there
that
the
members
had
the
right
to
discuss
within
themselves
and
to
pick
a
representative,
to
recommend
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
the
issue
presented
in
the
brotherhood
case
was
clearly
that
virginia
wouldn't
let
the
brotherhood
getaway
with
a
recommendation
for
--
approach.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
no.
no.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
justice
white,
i
find
no
difference
between
a
salaried
employer
and
a
person
on
retain.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
correct.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
on
the
contrary
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
is
a
question
which
you
have
raised
is
a
question
of
taking
care
of
the
need
of
indigents.
the
united
mine
workers
district
club
members
are
by
no
means
indigents.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
i
submit
that
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
but
the
bar
of
illinois
and
the
bar
throughout
this
country
did
not
object
to
the
oeo
program
for
the
indigent.
they
accepted--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that's
right.
but
there
is
an
entire
difference
between
that
type
of
representation
and
the
representation
for
a
person
who
is
a
salaried
employee,
a
person
who
is
making
money
and
who
has
a
claim
for
some
injury
that
he
received,
this
is
an
entirely
different
status
and
the
bar
has
never
stated
that
every
human
being
is
entitled
to
representation
if
they
belong
to
an
agency.
now
this
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
mr.
chief
justice,
yes
i
do.
i
think
that
is
correct,
that
there's
that
difference.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well
if
he
--
again
i
have
to
say
that's
the
same
thing.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
same
thing.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well,
he
became
indigent
perhaps
after
that
particular
occurrence
if
you
might
say,
maybe
he
didn't
i
don't
know
what
the
situation
maybe
from
his
injury
that
he
received
as
a
minor
but
that
does
not
put
him
over
into
the
class
of
the
indigent
before
the
event
by
any
manner
or
means
and
it
would
have
to
be
the
most
serious
type
of
situation
that
you
could
call
him
then
an
indigent.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
because
there's
a
protection
of
employment
that
he
had
in
one
instance
as
opposed
to
the
other.
i
would
say
that
would
possibly
be
one
of
the
answer
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
then
wasn't
necessarily
an
indigent.
he
became
poor
by
virtue
of
the
fact
he
may
not
been
able
to
work
but
in
the
case
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
but
in
the
minor
situation
he
has
of
course
the
protection
of
the
collective
bargaining
arrangements
and
the
welfare
program
of
his
union.
this
brings
to
the
question,
the
problem
that
is
raised
by
the
amicus
briefs.
i
think
that
the
question
of
group
legal
service
here
is
something
that
if
the
bar
is
to
or
to
look
forward
to
the
potentiality
of
group
legal
service
in
our
society,
we're
going
to
have
such
a
situation
that
there
will
be
no
control
of
lawyers,
there
will
be
the
situation
that
i
have
brought
to
the
court's
attention
in
the
objections
of
where
you've
been
advertised
willy-nilly
to
the
particular
group
that
you
represent
instead
of
having
just
unions
and
laboring
people
being
represented.
you
will
have
the
airline
pilots
association,
they
could
have
all
of
their
individual
matters
taken
care
of
by
their
salaried
lawyer,
the
american
manufacturers
association,
the
illinois
manufacturers
association.
all
of
their
various
potential
litigated
matters
or
legal
matters
will
trust
anything
of
that
nature,
taken
care
of
by
a
group
arrangement.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
and
i
would
say
that
illinois
is
a
forward-looking
bar
association
because
it
does
engage
in
that
type
of
procedure,
there's
a
large
legal
aid
bureau
in
chicago.
there
are
many
legal
aid
groups
throughout
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
because
there
the
people
are
in
need
of
legal
assistance
and
they
don't
have
the
means
to
get
it.
they
are
not
necessarily
in
the
absolute
impoverished
state
but
they
are
in
that
nebulous
state
where
they
don't
quite
have
enough
money
or
they
don't
quite
know
what
to
do
with
some
of
their
problems
that
are
bothering
them
and
this
is
a
perfect
place
for
them
to
go.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
of
course
mr.
chief
justice
i
say
that
that's
the
extreme
i
mean
we
--
i
claim
that
that's
the
extreme
that
they
can't.
when
you
become
ill
you
can't
pay
the
medical
and
when
you
have
a
legal
problem,
you
can't
pay
the
legal
fees,
those
are
the
extremes.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
that
is
correct.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
categorize
them
of
course
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
but
it
was
found
there
was
a
need
to
legal
aid
societies,
lawyer
reference
services
were
established
and
the
bar
has
done
a
great
service
to
the
public
by
being
involved
in
all
those
things.
but
what
we're
dealing
here
in
this
case
is
with
an
organization
that
has
members
who
are
not
impoverished.
the
state
of
illinois
is
the
fourth
largest
coal
producing
state
in
the
country.
it
has
a
tremendous
potential
of
employment
within
the
coal
field.
there
are
some
new
developments
in
the
coal
field,
that
are
just
occurring
right
at
the
present
time
and
these
are
going
to
mean
more
employment
for
the
union
member.
recently
the,
one
of
the
amicus
put
out
a
poll
to
try
and
find
out
just
what
type
of
person
the
union
member
was
and
the
affl-cio
found
out
that
their
member
is
the
type
of
person
who
goes
to
work,
from
work
to
his
home
in
the
suburbs
and
sits
in
his
backyard
with
a
highball
in
his
hand
and
complaints
about
high
taxes.
he
is
no
longer
the
indigent,
he
is
no
longer
the
poor
fellow,
he's
no
longer
the
fellow
who
lives
in
the
poor
areas
of
the
city.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
appalachia
is
a
different
thing
what
occurs
in
appalachia
and
what
is
--
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
i
won't
say
no
because
if
you
remember
mr.
combs
informed
the
court
that
in
appalachia
in
west
virginia,
they
also
had
a
complaint
by
the
bar
association
and
they
sat
down
and
worked
it
out.
we
tried
to
get
the
minors
to
sit
down
and
work
this
out
with
us,
they
refused,
they
took
the
adamant
approach.
mr.
bernard
h.
bertrand
we
wanted
them,
our
major
premise
was
we
wanted
them
to
follow
illinois
mineworker's
opinion
which
said
that
you
can
recommend
attorneys
whom
you
feel
to
be
competent;
we
wanted
them
to
do
that.
now,
there's
no
saying
that
we
would
not
have
perhaps
by
over
the
bargaining
table,
worked
out
something
that
in
the
judgment
of
the
committee
would
have
been
considered
a
proper
way
of
handling
the
union
members
business.
they
wouldn't
do
so
that's
why
we're
here.
thank
you,
very
much.
