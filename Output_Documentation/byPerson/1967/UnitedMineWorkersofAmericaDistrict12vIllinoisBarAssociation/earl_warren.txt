mr.

you
may
have
an
extra
five
minutes
also
if
you
need
it.
chief

mr.
bertrand
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
that's
not
what
i
asked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
this
is
unauthorized
practice
of
the
law,
certainly
the
lawyer
who
is
employed
is
guilty
of
unlawful
practice
of
law.
why
don't
you,
why
haven't
you
proceeded
against
him
in
the
last
54
years
having
been,
this
practice
having
been
in
existence
since
1913.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
the
complainant
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
his
complaint?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
this
case
is
10
years
old?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
this
man
is
only
been
there
two
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
other
than
that
the
state
bar
has
had
no
interest
in
this
matter
since
1913.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bertrand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
combs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
combs
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
in
some
states
i
know
that
the
legislature
in
its
concern
for
the
welfare
of
the
workers
themselves
limit
very
greatly
the
fees
that
can
be
charged
in
these
compensation
cases.
in
fact
they
discourage
lawyers
coming
there
at
all
and
they
have
put
the
percentage
of
the
award
so
low
that
it's
impossible
for
--
almost
impossible
for
a
workman
to
go
out
who
has
to
--
what
the
public
might
think
was
a
minor
injury,
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
go
out
and
hire
a
competent
lawyer
because
the
lawyer
wouldn't
spend
his
time
for
that
small
amount.
now
i
don't
know
whether
that's
exists
in
illinois
or
not,
but
does
it?
