justice

l.
black
does
it
bother
you
then
stating
(inaudible)
and
then
here
and
there
something
about
it,
does
it
bother
you
to
say
it
briefly
as
possible
that
the,
exactly
what
is
your
organization
and
how
it
functions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
contract
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
compensation
only?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
accusation
that
he
did
not
faithfully
represent
his
clients.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
constitutional
provision
you
say
involved
at
this
stage
from
client
lawyers
take
fees
rather
than
salary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
are
constitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
those
cases
stem
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
not
stem
from
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
right
to
seek
freely
and
the
right
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
which
one
of
those,
do
you
claim
comes
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
of
the
seven
divisions
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right
to
assemble
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
states
in
determining
the
policy
decides
legal
cases
that
he
handled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
case
you
relied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
combs
it
doesn't
take
--
the
last
part
of
time
and
questions,
you
may
have
five
minutes
more
to
reply
if
you
wish.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
why
you
wouldn't
do
that
if
that's
what
you
are
really
interested
in
and
in
the
preparation
of
your
case,
i
wonder
why
you
wouldn't
want
to
show
that
that
the
fact
that
this
man
did
have
that
number
of
cases
actually
resulted
in
these
people
having
poor
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
here
representing
the
bar—
justice
hugo
l.
black
--and
not
just
while
you've
been
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
okay,
did
that
go
to
the
question
of
whether
the
minors
themselves
received
the
treatment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
isn't
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
we
can't
consider
it
can
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
when
did
you
come
into
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
exactly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
1963?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
make
any,
did
you
make
any
investigation
to
find
out
whether
minors
have
been
properly
treated
under
this
system
before
your
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
did
you
find
any
instances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
you
put
them
in
the
record
by
affidavit
or
otherwise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
the
decree
entered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
very
well.
may
i
ask
you
speaking
on
the
constitution
whether
it's
relevant
as
to
what,
how
the
particular
man
does
this
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
not
question
of
challenge
to
assist
him,
and
are
you
challenging
in
any
way
the
manner
in
which
this
man
--
or
do
you
think
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
its
constitutionality?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
constitutionality?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
does
a
good
job
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
why
shouldn't
we
just
approach
the
constitutional
question
here,
mr.
justice
black's
suggestion
wholly
asides
them
from
these
matters
you
have
been
talking
about
it,
why
shouldn't
we
just
assume
that
the
service
here
is
good
if
not
better?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
in
other
words
if
they
employed
five
men
to
handle
these
400
cases
and
that
would
have
been
adequate
under
your
judgment
as
to
how
many
cases
a
lawyer
should
handle
without
the
same
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
there
is
in
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
did,
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
constitutionality,
under
the
federal
constitution
of
this
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what
is
the
basic
difference
between
that
employment
and
the
employment
there
is
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
the
general
situation
so
far
as
medical
care
in
this
country
is
concerned
with
a
great
mass
of
working
people,
they
are
not
indigent
at
one
moment
but
when
they
became
ill,
they
are
indigent
because
they
can't
pay
the
medical
expenses
but
in
this
situation
they
can't
pay
the
legal
expenses
to
get
their
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
many
millions
of
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
in
that
class
or
in
this
country
from
all
of
the
studies
that
have
been
made,
that's
what
brought
medicare
into
existence,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
wasn't
the
extreme
case,
it
was
normal
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
appalachia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
the
constitutional
principle
of
your
case
be
different
than
appalachia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
want
them
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it

are

why
wouldn't?
justice

what
do
those
cases
stem
on?
justice

do
they
not

the
