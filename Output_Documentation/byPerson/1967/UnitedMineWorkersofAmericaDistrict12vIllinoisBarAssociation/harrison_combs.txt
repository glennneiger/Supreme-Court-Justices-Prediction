mr.
harrison
combs
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
that
a
state
court
decree
conflicts
with
rights
of
coal
miners,
members
of
labor
union
and
it
holds
that
such
labor
union
is
engaged
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
by
employing
an
attorney
on
a
salary
basis
to
represent
it’s
members
with
respect
to
claims
arising
under
the
state’s
workmen’s
compensation
law.
the
bar
association
of
the
state
of
illinois
filed
a
complaint
in
the
sangamon
circuit
court
on
behalf
of
it’s
committee
on
unauthorized
practice
of
law
alleging
that
for
many
years
district
12,
united
mine
workers
had
been
engaged
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
in
that
it
involved
an
attorney,
a
duly
licensed
attorney,
state
of
illinois
to
represent
its
members
on
workmen’s
compensation
claims
who
were
injured
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
district
12
filed
an
answer
admitting
that
it
did
employ
such
an
attorney
by
stating
that
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
it
had
a
right
to
do
this.
it
denied
that
it
had
engaged
at
time
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law.
the
court
granted
a
sovereign
decree
in
the
circuit
court
in
sangamon
county
and
joining
the
continuation
of
this
legal
aid
claim.
district
12,
united
mine
workers
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
this
court
affirmed
the
decree
of
the
sangamon
circuit
court.
the
legal
aid
plan
in
question
here
was
set
up
by
a
convention
of
district
12,
united
mine
workers
in
1913
at
a
convention
held
at
peoria,
illinois.
the
convention
consisted
of
delegates
from
the
various
local
unions
and
various
coal
mines
in
the
state
of
illinois.
now
district
12
is
a
branch
of
united
mine
workers
of
america,
a
national
labor
organization.
it's
composed
of
some
14,000
members;
8,500
of
these
members
are
working
members
and
some
5,500
are
retired
members.
the
legal
aid
plan
in
question
here
was
set
up
as
i
say
in
1913.
it
was
set
up
because
the
delegates,
the
coal
miners
at
the
convention
in
their
discussions
said
that
the
claims
that
they
were
filing
in
the
state
courts
with
connection
with
their
injuries
were
being
mishandled.
i
think
the
words
juggled
were
used
and
that
even
the
claims
were
not
mishandled
that
it
cost
the
injured
employee
approximately
50,
from
40%
to
50%
of
the
rewards
given
and
attorney
fees
and
in
cost
to
the
court.
mr.
harrison
combs
workmen's
compensation
solely.
mr.
harrison
combs
well
it
was
in
fact
that
contemporaneously
worth
it,
i
think
that
the
workmen's
compensation
law
was
passed
in
1912,
if
i'm
not
mistaken
and
this
occurred
in
1913.
now
frankly
your
honor
that
the
discussions
merged
in
the
gut
of
the
need
of
a
workmen's
compensation
act
as
well
as
problem
they
we
are
having
of
recovering
any
damage
since
that
common
law.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor,
district
12
is
branch
of
national
organization,
administrative
purposes
and
this
jurisdiction
is
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
iowa.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes.
but
the
compensation
act
and
the
legal
aid
plan
is
confined
here
to
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
would
say
they
operate
in
28
states
and
i
would
say
that
over
half
of
them
have
some
plan
of
similar
nature
to
this.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor
it
is
in
the
record
but
i
can
answer
because
it
was
proceeding,
official
proceedings,
we
have
had
cases,
i
have
in
kentucky
and
in
west
virginia
and
some
discussion
in
ohio.
all
of
these
cases
were
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
local
bar
associations
and
committees,
that
there
was
no
court
action
in
any
of
these
cases
because
they
settled
before
that,
they
were
satisfied
with
our
explanation
of
--
mr.
harrison
combs
in
west
virginia
there
were
some
slight
changes
made.
but
i
think
the
heart
of
the
matter
is
--
would
still
be
this
question
of
paying
your
salary
here.
mr.
harrison
combs
he
has
additional
work,
because
in
no
instance
that
i
know
of
is
the
attorney
involved
solely
practicing
compensation
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
proven
to
be
more
satisfactory
to
have
an
attorney
in
the
general
practice
of
law
in
the
community
where
he
is
to
handle
these
cases.
mr.
harrison
combs
this
one
is
the
member
of
the
state
senate
and
perhaps
some
other
practice
(inaudible).
mr.
harrison
combs
we
just
--
he's
paid
on
a
salary
basis
your
honor
and
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well
i
don't
know
how
you'd
make
the
distinction.
i
suppose
he
would
consider
it
to
be
a
retainer.
we
call
it
a
salary.
mr.
harrison
combs
he
is
not
subject
to
the
direction
and
control
of
the
union
in
any
respect
with
the
exception
--
mr.
harrison
combs
he
is
not.
his
letter
of
employment
states
specifically
that
he
is
not
and
i'll
read
that
in
a
few
minutes,
we
did
not
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
the
terminology
that
is
been
used
just
simple
been
that
they
pay
him
a
salary
so
much,
so
i'm
not
making
a
point
in
the
distinction
on
what
he
does,
i
don't
know
about
what
he
calls
it,
but
--
mr.
harrison
combs
oh
yes.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
in
some
of
them
they
do
and
some
of
them
they
don't.
i
think
they
arrangement
sometimes,
they're
not
included
i
might
say
this.
for
our
purposes
of
pensions
and
for
group
health
these
attorneys
are
not
included
as
employees,
because
they
are
considered
to
be
on
a
fee
basis.
i'd
like
to
read
the
terms
of
employment
if
you
like.
mr.
harrison
combs
only
in
this
respect
your
honor.
if
there
was
a
controversy
with
reference
to
the
fee
they
will
set
an
award
and
yes
there
is
a
controversy
on
whether
or
not
it
was
unreasonable
they
would
act
on
that,
but
all
of
the
awards
or
fees
are
not
made
by
the
commission,
it
is
made
for
private
contract
between
the
claimant
and
the
attorney.
mr.
harrison
combs
not
if
--
the
attorney
involved
here,
no
sir.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
don't
see
where
there
would
be
a
fee
awarded,
there's
no
claim
ever
entered
for
a
fee.
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
such
an
instance
to
arise,
because
his
sole
compensation
is
to
be
according
to
his
employment
contract,
his
salary
is
paid
by
the
union.
and
the
recipient
receives
the
entire
amount
of
the
award,
no
cost
whatsoever
deducted.
and
i
think
it's
pertinent,
since
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question,
that
in
the
initial
setup
of
this
legal
aid
plan
in
1913,
the
resolution
authorizing
the
district
executive
board
to
setup
a
legal
department
and
to
employ
a
competent
attorney
to
represent
these
members
and
these
workmen's
compensation
claims.
the
resolution
itself
specified
that
this
was
to
be
available
to
the
claimant
if
he
wanted,
if
he
didn't
--
if
he
wanted
it
and
if
he
did
not
want
this
then
he
could
get
counsel
of
his
own
choosing
and
the
department
would
be
available
to
that
counsel
for
any
investigative
work
for
getting
ready
to
file
that
counsel,
the
man
chose
that
was
in
the
original
employment
authorization
by
the
men
who
were
at
the
convention.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
is
correct,
with
this
exception,
he
is
not
paid,
that's
right.
the
question
is,
that's
right,
but
under
this
plan
your
honor
the
local
unions
designate
particular
persons
in
the
local
union
to
help
this
man
who
is
injured
to
help
him
get
his
information
and
to
help
him
(inaudible).
now
this
is
agreeable
to
that
attorney
at
the
cost
of
the
union
and
that
was
provided
in
the
initial
employment.
now
the
current
case
rules
1963
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well
i'd
be
happy
to.
united
mine
workers
of
america
is
a
labor
organization
setup
in
1809.
it
has
jurisdiction
throughout
the
bituminous
and
anthracite
coal
fields
in
united
states
and
canada.
i
suppose
it
is
close
to
the
between
75%
or
80%
of
the
coal
miners
belonged
to
the
united
mine
workers.
and
they
bargained
in
the
coal
industry
through
districts
we
call
them
and
district
12
is
such
a
district.
these
districts
are
administrative
divisions
of
united
mine
workers
for
purposes
of
administrating
the
contracts
and
the
constitution
and
the
laws
et
cetera.
and
this
district
12
is
a
division
of
united
mine
workers
of
america
labor
organization
and
the
income
of
the
district
involved
here
comes
from
the
dues
of
the
members
of
that
district
and
the
international
union.
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
about
the
pertinent
point
i
would
say,
it's
un-incorporated
--
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
since
that
time.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
now
the
current
attorney
was
involved
as
a
result
of
a
resolution
of
1913,
now
here
is
this
important
contract
i
like
to
read
it,
it
is
very
brief.
mr.
harrison
combs
this
is
the
contract
between
the
current
attorney
who
represents
that
workman's
compensation
department
in
district
12
that's
involved
here,
this
attorney
is
involved
in
this
case.
and
this
is
in
private
contract
made
by
district
12
executive
board
reserved
to
the
resolution
of
1913
and
is
on
page
19
of
the
record
here
and
it
reads
as
follows,
it's
dated
26th
of
september
1963.
the
district
executive
board
has
authorized
the
undersigned
to
make
arrangements
with
you
to
handle
as
attorney,
compensation
cases
for
district
12
and
their
dependence
to
plead
and
desire
your
services.
mr.
harrison
combs
compensation
only.
if
accepted
by
you
the
salary
will
be
$12,400
per
year.
you
will
also
be
allowed
and
paid
reasonable
expenses.
it
will
be
your
duty
to
see
to
it
so
far
as
possible
with
the
help
of
the
secretaries
in
the
springfield
and
west
frankfort
offices
and
offices
of
local
unions
that
no
member
or
dependent
loses
his
rights
under
the
act
by
reason
of
failure
to
avail
himself,
avail
in
time.
also
to
represent
him
before
the
commission
if
he
desires
your
services,
if
he
is
represented
by
other
counsel
you
will
immediately
turn
over
his
file
to
such
counsel.
you
will
receive
no
further
instructions
or
directions
and
have
no
interference
from
the
district
nor
from
any
officer
and
your
obligations
and
relations
will
be
too
and
with
only
the
several
persons
you
represent.
this
arrangement
is
(inaudible)
and
acting
president.
now
that
is
the
employment
of
this
counsel
and
in
addition
to
the
services
of
this
counsel
and
by
the
way
he
is
a
member
of
the
state
bar
association
of
illinois,
he
is
a
member
of
the
american
bar
association
and
he
is
a
duly
licensed
attorney
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
he
is
a
senator
in
the
state
of
illinois.
now
in
addition
to
the
services
of
the
attorney,
the
union
secretaries
in
the
offices
at
west
frankfort
and
in
springfield
are
available
to
this
attorney
to
assist
him
in
the
filing
of
these
claims
and
getting
the
material
that's
necessary
for
these
cases.
this
attorney
meets
about
twice
a
week
in
these
offices,
he
is
available
for
conferences
with
any
injured
claimant.
the
claims
that
are
filed
here
are
filed
on
forms
that
are
distributed
to
the
local
unions
and
with
the
assistance
of
members
of
that
local
union
to
the
injured
claimant.
and
this
form
provides
the
necessary
information
about
what
kind
of
injury
he
has,
when
it
occurred
what
medical
records
that
he
may
have
and
what
the
controversy
is
about.
whether
or
not
that
he
is
paid
what
he
thinks
is
due
or
whether
or
not
that
his
compensation
has
been
cut
off
before
it
should
be
cut
off
and
whatever
the
dispute
is
between
the
attorney
and
i
mean
between
the
claimant
and
the
coal
company
involved.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor
he
is
included
in
this
only
this
complaint,
he
is
included
because
under
canons
47
and
35
that
he
is
lending
his
assistance,
he
is
charged
with
many
assistants
with
the
district
and
the
unauthorized
pact
of
law
in
that
respect.
now
there
has
been
no
complaints
filed
by
any
other
person
except
this
illinois
bar
association,
there
is
none
of
the
members
complaining,
there's
nobody
had
a
claim
that's
complaining
at
all,
it
just
simply
complained
in
the
bar
association.
mr.
harrison
combs
no
your
honor,
none
whatsoever.
now
as
i
said
--
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
no
your
honor
they
–
mr.
harrison
combs
no,
his
contract
is
solely
for
workmen's
compensation.
now
with
respect
to
other
practice
in
his
deposition
which
is
the
matter
of
this
record
here,
the
questions
were
asked
if
as
a
result
of
his
employment,
the
attention
that
that
he
got,
did
he
get
more
involvement
among
the
coal
miners
and
he
said
very
little
--
he
might
have
represented
one
or
two
and
he
didn't
remember
that.
but
as
far
as
the
union
and
the
contract
is
concerned
no,
that's
all
he
represents
them
and
it
was
one
exception
that
he
said
that
some
of
these
officers
of
the
district
that
they
should
ask
him
some
legal
question
or
something
like
that
he
would
be
glad
to
give
it
but
he
didn't
practice,
his
contract
was
exclusively
for
workmen's
compensation.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
he
does,
he
did
have
an
office,
--
yes.
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
right,
he
doesn't
have
an
office
on
the
property
as
such,
he
has
available
space
to
meet
with
these
claimants
in
the
springfield
office
and
in
the
office
of
west
frankfort
illinois.
mr.
harrison
combs
what
i
didn't,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harrison
combs
our
constitution
of
claim
is
precisely
representing
brotherhood
claim
that
these
coal
miners
had
right
to
meet
and
to
consult
and
advice
with
each
other
on
what
they
thought
would
be
their
best
protection
under
this
workman's
compensation
act,
and
in
this
particular
case
and
in
doing
that
that
they
had
a
right
to
agree
through
their
union
which
they
had
traditionally
depended
upon
to
employ
an
attorney
or
to
instruct
the
union
to
employ
one
in
the
system
of
compensation
act.
we
think
that
this
case
falls
squarely
under
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen's
case
decided
by
this
court.
now
if
your
honor
would
like
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
distinguished
between
the
trainmen
case
and
this
case
at
bar
here
by
saying
that
in
the
trainman
case
the
question
of
the
union
paying,
the
attorney
did
not
come
up
and
it
wasn't
decided
by
this
court
and
it
wasn't
because
they
worked
out
another
plan
with
relation
plan.
and
the
illinois
court
the
sole
objection
they
had
in
this
legal
aid
plan
was
just
simply
that
the
union
had
no
right
to
pay
this
man
on
salary
basis
and
that
they
restricted
now
from
having
any
financial
connections
between
the
union
and
the
attorney
employed.
they
wanted
the
claimant
to
pay
back
and
we
say
that
that
is
not
necessary
because
after
all
if
they
have
this
constitutional
right,
they
have
a
right
to
make
it
effective
in
a
lot
of
these
--
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
right.
let
me
read
what
it
said,
just
very
short.
here's
what
they
condemn
this
legal
aid
plan
for,
you
have
the
court's
words.
the
lawyer
is
not
paid
for
any
services
by
the
client.
his
salary
is
paid
by
the
association
and
because
the
interests
of
the
employer
and
the
client,
the
interest
of
the
union
collectively
may
extend
beyond
the
interest
of
the
injured
member.
now,
our
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
brennan
is
just
simply
this,
that
the
testimony
here
shows
conclusively
that
a
claim,
when
it
comes
up
that
the
claimant
himself
makes
the
determination
on
whether
that
will
be
settled
or
whether
that
will
go
on
to
hearing
and
the
awards
is
incomplete
sole
control.
now,
there
couldn't
be
any
conflict
between
the
union's
interest
and
the
man's
interests,
in
the
first
place
the
interest
came
up
for
reason
of
these
claims
and
the
authorizations,
the
contract
of
employment,
resolution
setting
up
this
department
in
1913
specifically
provides
that
this
claimant
is
going
to
be
in
control
of
this
lawsuit
on
what
he
wants
to
do
of
life.
and
we
think
that
the
court's
speculation
here
--
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
but
at
anytime
that
there's
been
an
abuse
of
this
representation
at
all,
that
at
any
time
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
this
because
of
a
conflict
between
the
union's
interest
and
the
possible
interests
of
the
client.
and
again
for
instance
that
in
the
future
if
this
legal
aid
plan
contend
that
first
thing
you
know
that
they're
getting
people
to
get
divorces
for
them
and
they
would
be
doing
this
and
doing
that,
well
of
course
you
can
speculate
almost
anything
but
it's
purely
speculation,
there's
not
a
cental
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
anything
occurred
here
it
wasn't
to
the
satisfaction
of
these
employees
here,
there's
no
complaints
at
all
about
their
services,
about
the
way
their
awards
are
settled
to
them
and
i
am
not
saying
this
that
in
regard
to
that
when
they
want
this
client
to
pay
this
legal
fee,
they're
talking
in
terms
here
of
this
record
was
about
five
years
in
excess
of
$2
million
and
under
the
record
here
in
the
evidence,
there
would
be
at
least
20%
of
that
reward
will
go
to
the
legal
fees
as
such
if
it
was
with
private
lawyers
together
with
the
cause
there
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
conceded,
it
does
a
great
benefit
to
these
coal
miner
to
arrange
it
independently.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
harrison
combs
we
are
saying
that
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
that
these
men
have
right
to
make
that
type
of
arraignment
with
the
lawyer
if
they
wanted.
we
are
saying
that
the
men
have
a
right
to
do
that
and
the
state
does
have
the
right
to
bridge
that
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
for
the
simple
reason
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i'm
relying
on
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
case.
mr.
harrison
combs
those
cases
stemmed
from
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
united
states
and
but
--
mr.
harrison
combs
first
and
fourteenth.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
the
first
--
mr.
harrison
combs
the
right
to
assemble
and
to
counsel
among
each
other
and
to
secure
the
rights
as
in
trainmen
now
specifically
--
mr.
harrison
combs
yeah
and
to
counsel
and
advice
and
just
select
their
spokesman
to
secure
these
rights,
these
legal
rights
if
they
have
underneath
workmen's
compensation
laws
in
this
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
this
court
in
button
held
that
the
naacp
had
a
right
to
handle
litigation
of
its
members
on
these
civil
rights
cases
and
it
further
held
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
that
by
paying
the
fees
of
those
lawyers
and
the
state
had
all
right
to
restrict
that
--
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
together
with
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
cases
which
pointed
out
in
terms
that
in
england
the
unions
paid
the
lawyers
a
practice
which
this
court
approved
in
button,
that's
in
the
trainmen
case,
so
we
think
that
it
becomes
squarely
within
those
two
cases,
yes
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
i
think
your
honor
there
would
be
a
distinction
in
this
but
that
would
be
for
commercial
purposes,
proper
motives
and
i
think
the
question
might
be
different
than
this
case
is.
there
is
no
question
here
that
union
getting
under
these
bonds
and
getting
under
benefit
except
as
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
pointed
out
that
the
union
had
an
active
continuing
interest
and
saying
that
these
members
of
theirs,
the
employees
who
were
injured
got
their
benefits
under
this
act,
supreme
court
admitted
that
and
stated
that.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
of
course
we
feel
like
this
court
said
in
the
naacp
case
and
in
brotherhood
case
that
because
they
labeled
it
that,
that
didn't
allow
them
to
infringe
on
these
other
rights
with
these
people
and
we
think
they
had
(inaudible).
mr.
harrison
combs
no
your
honor
certainly
not
we
don't
contend
that
in
this
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
not,
this
practice
of
law
that
you're
talking
about,
they're
not
practicing
law,
they're
hiring
a
lawyer
to
represent
them,
they're
going
into
this
phase
of
anybody's
right
to
hire
a
lawyer
to
represent.
mr.
harrison
combs
basically
that's
solely
on
the
fact
that
the
employee
doesn't
turn
it
outside
but
otherwise
--
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
because
the
attorney
declined
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
under
these
circumstances
i'm
saying
that
it
allows
(inaudible)
lawyer
under
this
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well
i
could
plan
to
a
lawyer
because
you're
trying
to
get
their
rights
under
worker
compensations
stats
that
is
a
practice
of
law,
that
is
the
practice
of
law,
everyone
is
trying
to
practice
law.
but
they
want
to
be,
they
want
to
be
able
to
get
a
lawyer
on
these
terms
when
they
need
one.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
am
not
arguing
that
i
don't
it's
--
mr.
harrison
combs
no,
i'm
not
arguing
that
this
lawyer
--
mr.
harrison
combs
our
argument
is
just
simply
this
that
this
man
was
licensed
for
the
state
of
illinois,
he
was
the
member
of
the
america
bar
association
and
this
man
had
a
right
under
those
laws
to
select
this
man
to
represent.
mr.
harrison
combs
from
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
united
states
together
with
the
fourteenth
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
brotherhood
and
railroad
trainmen
case.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
exactly.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
it
does.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
it
happens
in
this
way,
the
amounts
awarded
to
an
injured
employee
or
to
one
of
his
beneficiaries
is
taken
into
account
on
the
benefits
that
he
will
receive
from
the
welfare
plan.
mr.
harrison
combs
the
more
he
receives
the
less
welfare
will
be
out
and
more
they
will
have
for
their
funds.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor
and
the
bar
association
in
kentucky
accepted
that
argument
–
that's
where
--
mr.
harrison
combs
it
did
a
while
it
doesn't
but
it
pays
the
hospital
bills
for
its
members.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
through
the
welfare
clause.
mr.
harrison
combs
there
have
been
complaints
but
not
in
the
report
that
i
know
of.
mr.
harrison
combs
no
litigation
that
i
know
off.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor
there
is
deposition
a
way
to
compensate
them
but
they
are
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i'll
say
it's
fairly
prevalent.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor,
well
virtue
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
mr.
harrison
combs
no
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
right
of
district
12.
mr.
harrison
combs
thank
you
honor,
i
like
to
have
it.
mr.
harrison
combs
court
please,
by
way
of
rebuttal
in
connection
with
the
position
taken
by
counsel
that
the
bar
association
as
a
matter
of
policy
had
a
compelling
interest
to
protect
the
coal
miners
against
their
legal
aid
system
of
illinois
that's
what
it
was
known
to.
constitutional
issues
here
as
we
see
them
were
stated
by
this
court
in
the
trialing
case.
this
court
said
that
the
right
of
members
to
consult
with
each
other
in
a
paternal
organization
necessarily
includes
the
right
to
select
a
spokesman
from
their
member
and
could
be
expected
to
get
the
advice
of
his
counsel.
that
is
the
role
played
by
the
members
who
carry
out
the
legal
aid
program,
and
the
right
for
the
workers
personally
through
a
special
department,
under
a
brotherhood
to
advise
concerning
the
need
for
legal
assistance.
most
importantly
what
lawyer
and
member
could
confidently
rely
on
as
an
inseparable
part
of
this
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
to
assist
and
to
advise
each
other,
their
only
question
of
payment
by
counsel,
by
the
union
of
the
counsel.
the
railroad
workers
by
recommending
competent
lawyers
to
each
other
obviously
are
not
themselves
engaging
in
the
practice
of
law
nor
are
they
are
the
lawyers
who
may
select
parties
to
any
soliciting
events.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
great
britain
unions
do
not
simply
recommend
lawyers
to
members
in
need
of
advise,
the
retained
counsel,
paid
by
the
union
to
represent
members
in
personnel
law
suits,
a
practice
similar
to
that
which
we
upheld
in
naacp,
but
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
there
would
be
a
difference
if
the
court
please
--
in
this
case,
this
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well
let
me
read
what
the
court
said
about
that,
i
think
i
can
get
it
for
you
in
a
minute.
“in
our
consideration
to
this
case
the
policy
arguments
of
the
mine
workers
and
amica
at
present
--
”
this
is
illinois
brief
--
questions
of
the
hazards
involved
in
coal
mining
and
undoubtedly
the
possibility
exists
that
the
injured
coal
miners
untutored
in
the
intricacies
of
workmen's
compensation
law
might
accept
wholly
inadequate
settlements
--
benefit
to
the
miner
in
that
conversation,
the
counsel
or
the
client
here
in
fact
is
from
the
union
treasury
rather
than
the
injured
member
or
for
his
family
is
not
to
be
easily
disregarded.
now
we're
talking
about
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state,
in
some
instances
it
could
perhaps
infringe
to
some
extent
on
constitutional
rights
in
the
adjustments
there,
and
i
think
it
would
be
an
apex
in
your
honors
question
whether
or
not
that
the
need
as
demonstrated
so
clearly
as
this
court
in
justice
black's
opinion
said
in
the
trainmen
case
that
traditionally
that
the
railroad
people
had
an
awful
time
securing
their
rights
under
the
laws
of
the
country.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
would
make
a
different
case
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
the
daily
tactics
and
the
strategy
and
the
trying
of
this
lawsuit
that
the
union
interfered
in
to
that
--
anybody
rather
than
the
claimant
without
his
consent,
without
his
knowledge
or
engaging
in
it,
i
think
we'd
have
a
different
case.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
it
was
the
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
it
probably
could
in
some
instances
you
have
to
have
the
facts
in
order
to
determine
it.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
harlan
on
that,
but
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
this
court
said
in
the
button
case
that
whether
we
are
charging
solicitation
in
virginia,
and
that,
that
was
one
of
the
main
reasons
the
court
struck
down
the
plan
of
the
naacp,
that
there
was
a
total
absence
of
any
evidence
dealing
with
solicitation
in
that
case
and
the
state
cannot
through
the
guards
of
labels,
et
cetera,
strike
down
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
people.
mr.
harrison
combs
yeah.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
we
definitely
could,
i
think--
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
we
do
under
statute
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
the
act
gives
these
coal
miners
the
right
of
mutual
aided
benefits
and
protection
concerning
activities
that,
that
might
well
include
their
right
to
select
counsel
in
workmen's
compensation
case.
mr.
harrison
combs
to
that
extent
because
we
don't
believe
that
the
state
under
the
guides
of
regulating
the
practice
of
law
can
interfere
with
an
act
of
congress,
is
constitutionally
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
doubt
that
it
would
exist
in
illinois
for
this
reason
and
i
think
this
a
very
pertinent
observation.
for
54
years
the
union
has
been
able
to
protect
those
member's
rights
down
in
there,
and
we've
got
a
good
situation
not
because
of
what
they
are
arriving
here,
but
in
spite
of
it.
i
think
that
they've
been
able
to
protect
their
members
down
there,
just
like
this
welfare
fund
--
the
court
was
making
the
inquiries
about.
they
like
to
take
great
credit
for
it,
but
in
getting
that
welfare
fund
every
legal
obstruction,
there
were
other
obstructions,
but
in
the
way
of
it,
we
feel
that
if
this
position
taken
the
bar
association
in
this
instance
prevails,
that
we'll
have
the
same
situation
that
developed
and
has
existed
in
1912
that
led
up
to
this
situation
and
we
think
we've
improved
down
here
in
situation.
mr.
harrison
combs
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
that
a
state
court
decree
conflicts
with
rights
of
coal
miners,
members
of
labor
union
and
it
holds
that
such
labor
union
is
engaged
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
by
employing
an
attorney
on
a
salary
basis
to
represent
it’s
members
with
respect
to
claims
arising
under
the
state’s
workmen’s
compensation
law.
the
bar
association
of
the
state
of
illinois
filed
a
complaint
in
the
sangamon
circuit
court
on
behalf
of
it’s
committee
on
unauthorized
practice
of
law
alleging
that
for
many
years
district
12,
united
mine
workers
had
been
engaged
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
in
that
it
involved
an
attorney,
a
duly
licensed
attorney,
state
of
illinois
to
represent
its
members
on
workmen’s
compensation
claims
who
were
injured
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
district
12
filed
an
answer
admitting
that
it
did
employ
such
an
attorney
by
stating
that
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
it
had
a
right
to
do
this.
it
denied
that
it
had
engaged
at
time
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law.
the
court
granted
a
sovereign
decree
in
the
circuit
court
in
sangamon
county
and
joining
the
continuation
of
this
legal
aid
claim.
district
12,
united
mine
workers
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
this
court
affirmed
the
decree
of
the
sangamon
circuit
court.
the
legal
aid
plan
in
question
here
was
set
up
by
a
convention
of
district
12,
united
mine
workers
in
1913
at
a
convention
held
at
peoria,
illinois.
the
convention
consisted
of
delegates
from
the
various
local
unions
and
various
coal
mines
in
the
state
of
illinois.
now
district
12
is
a
branch
of
united
mine
workers
of
america,
a
national
labor
organization.
it's
composed
of
some
14,000
members;
8,500
of
these
members
are
working
members
and
some
5,500
are
retired
members.
the
legal
aid
plan
in
question
here
was
set
up
as
i
say
in
1913.
it
was
set
up
because
the
delegates,
the
coal
miners
at
the
convention
in
their
discussions
said
that
the
claims
that
they
were
filing
in
the
state
courts
with
connection
with
their
injuries
were
being
mishandled.
i
think
the
words
juggled
were
used
and
that
even
the
claims
were
not
mishandled
that
it
cost
the
injured
employee
approximately
50,
from
40%
to
50%
of
the
rewards
given
and
attorney
fees
and
in
cost
to
the
court.
mr.
harrison
combs
workmen's
compensation
solely.
mr.
harrison
combs
well
it
was
in
fact
that
contemporaneously
worth
it,
i
think
that
the
workmen's
compensation
law
was
passed
in
1912,
if
i'm
not
mistaken
and
this
occurred
in
1913.
now
frankly
your
honor
that
the
discussions
merged
in
the
gut
of
the
need
of
a
workmen's
compensation
act
as
well
as
problem
they
we
are
having
of
recovering
any
damage
since
that
common
law.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor,
district
12
is
branch
of
national
organization,
administrative
purposes
and
this
jurisdiction
is
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
iowa.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes.
but
the
compensation
act
and
the
legal
aid
plan
is
confined
here
to
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
would
say
they
operate
in
28
states
and
i
would
say
that
over
half
of
them
have
some
plan
of
similar
nature
to
this.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor
it
is
in
the
record
but
i
can
answer
because
it
was
proceeding,
official
proceedings,
we
have
had
cases,
i
have
in
kentucky
and
in
west
virginia
and
some
discussion
in
ohio.
all
of
these
cases
were
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
local
bar
associations
and
committees,
that
there
was
no
court
action
in
any
of
these
cases
because
they
settled
before
that,
they
were
satisfied
with
our
explanation
of
--
mr.
harrison
combs
in
west
virginia
there
were
some
slight
changes
made.
but
i
think
the
heart
of
the
matter
is
--
would
still
be
this
question
of
paying
your
salary
here.
mr.
harrison
combs
he
has
additional
work,
because
in
no
instance
that
i
know
of
is
the
attorney
involved
solely
practicing
compensation
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
proven
to
be
more
satisfactory
to
have
an
attorney
in
the
general
practice
of
law
in
the
community
where
he
is
to
handle
these
cases.
mr.
harrison
combs
this
one
is
the
member
of
the
state
senate
and
perhaps
some
other
practice
(inaudible).
mr.
harrison
combs
we
just
--
he's
paid
on
a
salary
basis
your
honor
and
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well
i
don't
know
how
you'd
make
the
distinction.
i
suppose
he
would
consider
it
to
be
a
retainer.
we
call
it
a
salary.
mr.
harrison
combs
he
is
not
subject
to
the
direction
and
control
of
the
union
in
any
respect
with
the
exception
--
mr.
harrison
combs
he
is
not.
his
letter
of
employment
states
specifically
that
he
is
not
and
i'll
read
that
in
a
few
minutes,
we
did
not
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
the
terminology
that
is
been
used
just
simple
been
that
they
pay
him
a
salary
so
much,
so
i'm
not
making
a
point
in
the
distinction
on
what
he
does,
i
don't
know
about
what
he
calls
it,
but
--
mr.
harrison
combs
oh
yes.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
in
some
of
them
they
do
and
some
of
them
they
don't.
i
think
they
arrangement
sometimes,
they're
not
included
i
might
say
this.
for
our
purposes
of
pensions
and
for
group
health
these
attorneys
are
not
included
as
employees,
because
they
are
considered
to
be
on
a
fee
basis.
i'd
like
to
read
the
terms
of
employment
if
you
like.
mr.
harrison
combs
only
in
this
respect
your
honor.
if
there
was
a
controversy
with
reference
to
the
fee
they
will
set
an
award
and
yes
there
is
a
controversy
on
whether
or
not
it
was
unreasonable
they
would
act
on
that,
but
all
of
the
awards
or
fees
are
not
made
by
the
commission,
it
is
made
for
private
contract
between
the
claimant
and
the
attorney.
mr.
harrison
combs
not
if
--
the
attorney
involved
here,
no
sir.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
don't
see
where
there
would
be
a
fee
awarded,
there's
no
claim
ever
entered
for
a
fee.
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
such
an
instance
to
arise,
because
his
sole
compensation
is
to
be
according
to
his
employment
contract,
his
salary
is
paid
by
the
union.
and
the
recipient
receives
the
entire
amount
of
the
award,
no
cost
whatsoever
deducted.
and
i
think
it's
pertinent,
since
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question,
that
in
the
initial
setup
of
this
legal
aid
plan
in
1913,
the
resolution
authorizing
the
district
executive
board
to
setup
a
legal
department
and
to
employ
a
competent
attorney
to
represent
these
members
and
these
workmen's
compensation
claims.
the
resolution
itself
specified
that
this
was
to
be
available
to
the
claimant
if
he
wanted,
if
he
didn't
--
if
he
wanted
it
and
if
he
did
not
want
this
then
he
could
get
counsel
of
his
own
choosing
and
the
department
would
be
available
to
that
counsel
for
any
investigative
work
for
getting
ready
to
file
that
counsel,
the
man
chose
that
was
in
the
original
employment
authorization
by
the
men
who
were
at
the
convention.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
is
correct,
with
this
exception,
he
is
not
paid,
that's
right.
the
question
is,
that's
right,
but
under
this
plan
your
honor
the
local
unions
designate
particular
persons
in
the
local
union
to
help
this
man
who
is
injured
to
help
him
get
his
information
and
to
help
him
(inaudible).
now
this
is
agreeable
to
that
attorney
at
the
cost
of
the
union
and
that
was
provided
in
the
initial
employment.
now
the
current
case
rules
1963
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well
i'd
be
happy
to.
united
mine
workers
of
america
is
a
labor
organization
setup
in
1809.
it
has
jurisdiction
throughout
the
bituminous
and
anthracite
coal
fields
in
united
states
and
canada.
i
suppose
it
is
close
to
the
between
75%
or
80%
of
the
coal
miners
belonged
to
the
united
mine
workers.
and
they
bargained
in
the
coal
industry
through
districts
we
call
them
and
district
12
is
such
a
district.
these
districts
are
administrative
divisions
of
united
mine
workers
for
purposes
of
administrating
the
contracts
and
the
constitution
and
the
laws
et
cetera.
and
this
district
12
is
a
division
of
united
mine
workers
of
america
labor
organization
and
the
income
of
the
district
involved
here
comes
from
the
dues
of
the
members
of
that
district
and
the
international
union.
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
about
the
pertinent
point
i
would
say,
it's
un-incorporated
--
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
since
that
time.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
now
the
current
attorney
was
involved
as
a
result
of
a
resolution
of
1913,
now
here
is
this
important
contract
i
like
to
read
it,
it
is
very
brief.
mr.
harrison
combs
this
is
the
contract
between
the
current
attorney
who
represents
that
workman's
compensation
department
in
district
12
that's
involved
here,
this
attorney
is
involved
in
this
case.
and
this
is
in
private
contract
made
by
district
12
executive
board
reserved
to
the
resolution
of
1913
and
is
on
page
19
of
the
record
here
and
it
reads
as
follows,
it's
dated
26th
of
september
1963.
the
district
executive
board
has
authorized
the
undersigned
to
make
arrangements
with
you
to
handle
as
attorney,
compensation
cases
for
district
12
and
their
dependence
to
plead
and
desire
your
services.
mr.
harrison
combs
compensation
only.
if
accepted
by
you
the
salary
will
be
$12,400
per
year.
you
will
also
be
allowed
and
paid
reasonable
expenses.
it
will
be
your
duty
to
see
to
it
so
far
as
possible
with
the
help
of
the
secretaries
in
the
springfield
and
west
frankfort
offices
and
offices
of
local
unions
that
no
member
or
dependent
loses
his
rights
under
the
act
by
reason
of
failure
to
avail
himself,
avail
in
time.
also
to
represent
him
before
the
commission
if
he
desires
your
services,
if
he
is
represented
by
other
counsel
you
will
immediately
turn
over
his
file
to
such
counsel.
you
will
receive
no
further
instructions
or
directions
and
have
no
interference
from
the
district
nor
from
any
officer
and
your
obligations
and
relations
will
be
too
and
with
only
the
several
persons
you
represent.
this
arrangement
is
(inaudible)
and
acting
president.
now
that
is
the
employment
of
this
counsel
and
in
addition
to
the
services
of
this
counsel
and
by
the
way
he
is
a
member
of
the
state
bar
association
of
illinois,
he
is
a
member
of
the
american
bar
association
and
he
is
a
duly
licensed
attorney
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
he
is
a
senator
in
the
state
of
illinois.
now
in
addition
to
the
services
of
the
attorney,
the
union
secretaries
in
the
offices
at
west
frankfort
and
in
springfield
are
available
to
this
attorney
to
assist
him
in
the
filing
of
these
claims
and
getting
the
material
that's
necessary
for
these
cases.
this
attorney
meets
about
twice
a
week
in
these
offices,
he
is
available
for
conferences
with
any
injured
claimant.
the
claims
that
are
filed
here
are
filed
on
forms
that
are
distributed
to
the
local
unions
and
with
the
assistance
of
members
of
that
local
union
to
the
injured
claimant.
and
this
form
provides
the
necessary
information
about
what
kind
of
injury
he
has,
when
it
occurred
what
medical
records
that
he
may
have
and
what
the
controversy
is
about.
whether
or
not
that
he
is
paid
what
he
thinks
is
due
or
whether
or
not
that
his
compensation
has
been
cut
off
before
it
should
be
cut
off
and
whatever
the
dispute
is
between
the
attorney
and
i
mean
between
the
claimant
and
the
coal
company
involved.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor
he
is
included
in
this
only
this
complaint,
he
is
included
because
under
canons
47
and
35
that
he
is
lending
his
assistance,
he
is
charged
with
many
assistants
with
the
district
and
the
unauthorized
pact
of
law
in
that
respect.
now
there
has
been
no
complaints
filed
by
any
other
person
except
this
illinois
bar
association,
there
is
none
of
the
members
complaining,
there's
nobody
had
a
claim
that's
complaining
at
all,
it
just
simply
complained
in
the
bar
association.
mr.
harrison
combs
no
your
honor,
none
whatsoever.
now
as
i
said
--
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
no
your
honor
they
–
mr.
harrison
combs
no,
his
contract
is
solely
for
workmen's
compensation.
now
with
respect
to
other
practice
in
his
deposition
which
is
the
matter
of
this
record
here,
the
questions
were
asked
if
as
a
result
of
his
employment,
the
attention
that
that
he
got,
did
he
get
more
involvement
among
the
coal
miners
and
he
said
very
little
--
he
might
have
represented
one
or
two
and
he
didn't
remember
that.
but
as
far
as
the
union
and
the
contract
is
concerned
no,
that's
all
he
represents
them
and
it
was
one
exception
that
he
said
that
some
of
these
officers
of
the
district
that
they
should
ask
him
some
legal
question
or
something
like
that
he
would
be
glad
to
give
it
but
he
didn't
practice,
his
contract
was
exclusively
for
workmen's
compensation.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
he
does,
he
did
have
an
office,
--
yes.
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
right,
he
doesn't
have
an
office
on
the
property
as
such,
he
has
available
space
to
meet
with
these
claimants
in
the
springfield
office
and
in
the
office
of
west
frankfort
illinois.
mr.
harrison
combs
what
i
didn't,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harrison
combs
our
constitution
of
claim
is
precisely
representing
brotherhood
claim
that
these
coal
miners
had
right
to
meet
and
to
consult
and
advice
with
each
other
on
what
they
thought
would
be
their
best
protection
under
this
workman's
compensation
act,
and
in
this
particular
case
and
in
doing
that
that
they
had
a
right
to
agree
through
their
union
which
they
had
traditionally
depended
upon
to
employ
an
attorney
or
to
instruct
the
union
to
employ
one
in
the
system
of
compensation
act.
we
think
that
this
case
falls
squarely
under
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen's
case
decided
by
this
court.
now
if
your
honor
would
like
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
distinguished
between
the
trainmen
case
and
this
case
at
bar
here
by
saying
that
in
the
trainman
case
the
question
of
the
union
paying,
the
attorney
did
not
come
up
and
it
wasn't
decided
by
this
court
and
it
wasn't
because
they
worked
out
another
plan
with
relation
plan.
and
the
illinois
court
the
sole
objection
they
had
in
this
legal
aid
plan
was
just
simply
that
the
union
had
no
right
to
pay
this
man
on
salary
basis
and
that
they
restricted
now
from
having
any
financial
connections
between
the
union
and
the
attorney
employed.
they
wanted
the
claimant
to
pay
back
and
we
say
that
that
is
not
necessary
because
after
all
if
they
have
this
constitutional
right,
they
have
a
right
to
make
it
effective
in
a
lot
of
these
--
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
that's
right.
let
me
read
what
it
said,
just
very
short.
here's
what
they
condemn
this
legal
aid
plan
for,
you
have
the
court's
words.
the
lawyer
is
not
paid
for
any
services
by
the
client.
his
salary
is
paid
by
the
association
and
because
the
interests
of
the
employer
and
the
client,
the
interest
of
the
union
collectively
may
extend
beyond
the
interest
of
the
injured
member.
now,
our
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
brennan
is
just
simply
this,
that
the
testimony
here
shows
conclusively
that
a
claim,
when
it
comes
up
that
the
claimant
himself
makes
the
determination
on
whether
that
will
be
settled
or
whether
that
will
go
on
to
hearing
and
the
awards
is
incomplete
sole
control.
now,
there
couldn't
be
any
conflict
between
the
union's
interest
and
the
man's
interests,
in
the
first
place
the
interest
came
up
for
reason
of
these
claims
and
the
authorizations,
the
contract
of
employment,
resolution
setting
up
this
department
in
1913
specifically
provides
that
this
claimant
is
going
to
be
in
control
of
this
lawsuit
on
what
he
wants
to
do
of
life.
and
we
think
that
the
court's
speculation
here
--
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
but
at
anytime
that
there's
been
an
abuse
of
this
representation
at
all,
that
at
any
time
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
this
because
of
a
conflict
between
the
union's
interest
and
the
possible
interests
of
the
client.
and
again
for
instance
that
in
the
future
if
this
legal
aid
plan
contend
that
first
thing
you
know
that
they're
getting
people
to
get
divorces
for
them
and
they
would
be
doing
this
and
doing
that,
well
of
course
you
can
speculate
almost
anything
but
it's
purely
speculation,
there's
not
a
cental
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
anything
occurred
here
it
wasn't
to
the
satisfaction
of
these
employees
here,
there's
no
complaints
at
all
about
their
services,
about
the
way
their
awards
are
settled
to
them
and
i
am
not
saying
this
that
in
regard
to
that
when
they
want
this
client
to
pay
this
legal
fee,
they're
talking
in
terms
here
of
this
record
was
about
five
years
in
excess
of
$2
million
and
under
the
record
here
in
the
evidence,
there
would
be
at
least
20%
of
that
reward
will
go
to
the
legal
fees
as
such
if
it
was
with
private
lawyers
together
with
the
cause
there
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
conceded,
it
does
a
great
benefit
to
these
coal
miner
to
arrange
it
independently.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
harrison
combs
we
are
saying
that
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
that
these
men
have
right
to
make
that
type
of
arraignment
with
the
lawyer
if
they
wanted.
we
are
saying
that
the
men
have
a
right
to
do
that
and
the
state
does
have
the
right
to
bridge
that
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
for
the
simple
reason
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i'm
relying
on
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
case.
mr.
harrison
combs
those
cases
stemmed
from
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
united
states
and
but
--
mr.
harrison
combs
first
and
fourteenth.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
the
first
--
mr.
harrison
combs
the
right
to
assemble
and
to
counsel
among
each
other
and
to
secure
the
rights
as
in
trainmen
now
specifically
--
mr.
harrison
combs
yeah
and
to
counsel
and
advice
and
just
select
their
spokesman
to
secure
these
rights,
these
legal
rights
if
they
have
underneath
workmen's
compensation
laws
in
this
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
this
court
in
button
held
that
the
naacp
had
a
right
to
handle
litigation
of
its
members
on
these
civil
rights
cases
and
it
further
held
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
that
by
paying
the
fees
of
those
lawyers
and
the
state
had
all
right
to
restrict
that
--
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
together
with
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
cases
which
pointed
out
in
terms
that
in
england
the
unions
paid
the
lawyers
a
practice
which
this
court
approved
in
button,
that's
in
the
trainmen
case,
so
we
think
that
it
becomes
squarely
within
those
two
cases,
yes
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
i
think
your
honor
there
would
be
a
distinction
in
this
but
that
would
be
for
commercial
purposes,
proper
motives
and
i
think
the
question
might
be
different
than
this
case
is.
there
is
no
question
here
that
union
getting
under
these
bonds
and
getting
under
benefit
except
as
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
pointed
out
that
the
union
had
an
active
continuing
interest
and
saying
that
these
members
of
theirs,
the
employees
who
were
injured
got
their
benefits
under
this
act,
supreme
court
admitted
that
and
stated
that.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
of
course
we
feel
like
this
court
said
in
the
naacp
case
and
in
brotherhood
case
that
because
they
labeled
it
that,
that
didn't
allow
them
to
infringe
on
these
other
rights
with
these
people
and
we
think
they
had
(inaudible).
mr.
harrison
combs
no
your
honor
certainly
not
we
don't
contend
that
in
this
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
not,
this
practice
of
law
that
you're
talking
about,
they're
not
practicing
law,
they're
hiring
a
lawyer
to
represent
them,
they're
going
into
this
phase
of
anybody's
right
to
hire
a
lawyer
to
represent.
mr.
harrison
combs
basically
that's
solely
on
the
fact
that
the
employee
doesn't
turn
it
outside
but
otherwise
--
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
because
the
attorney
declined
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
under
these
circumstances
i'm
saying
that
it
allows
(inaudible)
lawyer
under
this
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well
i
could
plan
to
a
lawyer
because
you're
trying
to
get
their
rights
under
worker
compensations
stats
that
is
a
practice
of
law,
that
is
the
practice
of
law,
everyone
is
trying
to
practice
law.
but
they
want
to
be,
they
want
to
be
able
to
get
a
lawyer
on
these
terms
when
they
need
one.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
am
not
arguing
that
i
don't
it's
--
mr.
harrison
combs
no,
i'm
not
arguing
that
this
lawyer
--
mr.
harrison
combs
our
argument
is
just
simply
this
that
this
man
was
licensed
for
the
state
of
illinois,
he
was
the
member
of
the
america
bar
association
and
this
man
had
a
right
under
those
laws
to
select
this
man
to
represent.
mr.
harrison
combs
from
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
united
states
together
with
the
fourteenth
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
brotherhood
and
railroad
trainmen
case.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
exactly.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
it
does.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
it
happens
in
this
way,
the
amounts
awarded
to
an
injured
employee
or
to
one
of
his
beneficiaries
is
taken
into
account
on
the
benefits
that
he
will
receive
from
the
welfare
plan.
mr.
harrison
combs
the
more
he
receives
the
less
welfare
will
be
out
and
more
they
will
have
for
their
funds.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor
and
the
bar
association
in
kentucky
accepted
that
argument
–
that's
where
--
mr.
harrison
combs
it
did
a
while
it
doesn't
but
it
pays
the
hospital
bills
for
its
members.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
through
the
welfare
clause.
mr.
harrison
combs
there
have
been
complaints
but
not
in
the
report
that
i
know
of.
mr.
harrison
combs
no
litigation
that
i
know
off.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor
there
is
deposition
a
way
to
compensate
them
but
they
are
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i'll
say
it's
fairly
prevalent.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
your
honor,
well
virtue
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
mr.
harrison
combs
no
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
combs
right
of
district
12.
mr.
harrison
combs
thank
you
honor,
i
like
to
have
it.
mr.
harrison
combs
court
please,
by
way
of
rebuttal
in
connection
with
the
position
taken
by
counsel
that
the
bar
association
as
a
matter
of
policy
had
a
compelling
interest
to
protect
the
coal
miners
against
their
legal
aid
system
of
illinois
that's
what
it
was
known
to.
constitutional
issues
here
as
we
see
them
were
stated
by
this
court
in
the
trialing
case.
this
court
said
that
the
right
of
members
to
consult
with
each
other
in
a
paternal
organization
necessarily
includes
the
right
to
select
a
spokesman
from
their
member
and
could
be
expected
to
get
the
advice
of
his
counsel.
that
is
the
role
played
by
the
members
who
carry
out
the
legal
aid
program,
and
the
right
for
the
workers
personally
through
a
special
department,
under
a
brotherhood
to
advise
concerning
the
need
for
legal
assistance.
most
importantly
what
lawyer
and
member
could
confidently
rely
on
as
an
inseparable
part
of
this
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
to
assist
and
to
advise
each
other,
their
only
question
of
payment
by
counsel,
by
the
union
of
the
counsel.
the
railroad
workers
by
recommending
competent
lawyers
to
each
other
obviously
are
not
themselves
engaging
in
the
practice
of
law
nor
are
they
are
the
lawyers
who
may
select
parties
to
any
soliciting
events.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
great
britain
unions
do
not
simply
recommend
lawyers
to
members
in
need
of
advise,
the
retained
counsel,
paid
by
the
union
to
represent
members
in
personnel
law
suits,
a
practice
similar
to
that
which
we
upheld
in
naacp,
but
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
there
would
be
a
difference
if
the
court
please
--
in
this
case,
this
--
mr.
harrison
combs
well
let
me
read
what
the
court
said
about
that,
i
think
i
can
get
it
for
you
in
a
minute.
“in
our
consideration
to
this
case
the
policy
arguments
of
the
mine
workers
and
amica
at
present
--
”
this
is
illinois
brief
--
questions
of
the
hazards
involved
in
coal
mining
and
undoubtedly
the
possibility
exists
that
the
injured
coal
miners
untutored
in
the
intricacies
of
workmen's
compensation
law
might
accept
wholly
inadequate
settlements
--
benefit
to
the
miner
in
that
conversation,
the
counsel
or
the
client
here
in
fact
is
from
the
union
treasury
rather
than
the
injured
member
or
for
his
family
is
not
to
be
easily
disregarded.
now
we're
talking
about
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state,
in
some
instances
it
could
perhaps
infringe
to
some
extent
on
constitutional
rights
in
the
adjustments
there,
and
i
think
it
would
be
an
apex
in
your
honors
question
whether
or
not
that
the
need
as
demonstrated
so
clearly
as
this
court
in
justice
black's
opinion
said
in
the
trainmen
case
that
traditionally
that
the
railroad
people
had
an
awful
time
securing
their
rights
under
the
laws
of
the
country.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
would
make
a
different
case
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
the
daily
tactics
and
the
strategy
and
the
trying
of
this
lawsuit
that
the
union
interfered
in
to
that
--
anybody
rather
than
the
claimant
without
his
consent,
without
his
knowledge
or
engaging
in
it,
i
think
we'd
have
a
different
case.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
it
was
the
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
it
probably
could
in
some
instances
you
have
to
have
the
facts
in
order
to
determine
it.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
harlan
on
that,
but
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
this
court
said
in
the
button
case
that
whether
we
are
charging
solicitation
in
virginia,
and
that,
that
was
one
of
the
main
reasons
the
court
struck
down
the
plan
of
the
naacp,
that
there
was
a
total
absence
of
any
evidence
dealing
with
solicitation
in
that
case
and
the
state
cannot
through
the
guards
of
labels,
et
cetera,
strike
down
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
people.
mr.
harrison
combs
yeah.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
we
definitely
could,
i
think--
mr.
harrison
combs
yes
we
do
under
statute
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
the
act
gives
these
coal
miners
the
right
of
mutual
aided
benefits
and
protection
concerning
activities
that,
that
might
well
include
their
right
to
select
counsel
in
workmen's
compensation
case.
mr.
harrison
combs
to
that
extent
because
we
don't
believe
that
the
state
under
the
guides
of
regulating
the
practice
of
law
can
interfere
with
an
act
of
congress,
is
constitutionally
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
doubt
that
it
would
exist
in
illinois
for
this
reason
and
i
think
this
a
very
pertinent
observation.
for
54
years
the
union
has
been
able
to
protect
those
member's
rights
down
in
there,
and
we've
got
a
good
situation
not
because
of
what
they
are
arriving
here,
but
in
spite
of
it.
i
think
that
they've
been
able
to
protect
their
members
down
there,
just
like
this
welfare
fund
--
the
court
was
making
the
inquiries
about.
they
like
to
take
great
credit
for
it,
but
in
getting
that
welfare
fund
every
legal
obstruction,
there
were
other
obstructions,
but
in
the
way
of
it,
we
feel
that
if
this
position
taken
the
bar
association
in
this
instance
prevails,
that
we'll
have
the
same
situation
that
developed
and
has
existed
in
1912
that
led
up
to
this
situation
and
we
think
we've
improved
down
here
in
situation.
