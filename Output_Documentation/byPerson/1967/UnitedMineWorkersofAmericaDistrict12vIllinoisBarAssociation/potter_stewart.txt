justice
potter
stewart
that
was
for
the
day,
workmen's
compensation
act
1913.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
before
the
days
workmen's
compensation
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
since
i
have
already
interrupted
you,
you
tell
me
what
is
district
12,
is
that
the
statewide
--?
justice
potter
stewart
throughout
the
state
of
illinois
and
iowa
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this,
does
the
umw
have
the
same
plans
or
similar
plans
in
other
states?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
other
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
this
cases
where
it's
made
by
the
commission,
does
this
attorney
keep
the
fee
in
addition
to
the
salary?
justice
potter
stewart
what
happens
to
the
fee?
justice
potter
stewart
this
plan
of
paying
a
salaried
lawyer,
hiring
a
salaried
lawyer
and
it
runs
back
in
1913
as
you
tell.
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
has
that
actually
been
in
existence,
this
particular
plan?
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
time
since
1913.
justice
potter
stewart
his
representation
of
the
members
of
district
12
is
limited
exclusively
to
workmen's
compensation
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
other
words
he
doesn't
get
divorces
for
them
or
represent
them
in
criminal
charges
or
anything
else,
write
their
wills
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
help
them
in
selling
their
houses
or
buying
their
houses.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
whether
he
has
an
office,
his
own
a
law
office.
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
the
property
of
the
district
--.
justice
potter
stewart
what
precisely
is
your
constitutional
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
what
precisely
is
your
constitutional
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
see
mr.
combs's
that
in
other
words
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
said
you
had
a
service
limited
to
referral
to
this
particular
lawyer
of
your
members.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
wise
thing
is
as
they
saw
it
was
simply
that
you
paid
him
a
salary.
justice
potter
stewart
for
performing
the
services
for
the
members.
justice
potter
stewart
well
they
had
the
right
to
hire
somebody
who
wasn't
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
constitutional
right,
i
should
think
it's
constitutional
right,
the
state
has
no
power
to
regulate
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
had
understood
the
theory
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
the
theory
of
the
charges
against
you
in
the
courts
of
illinois
it
was
that
this
unincorporated
association
was
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
itself
just
as
a
bank
can
be
under
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
that
was
the
theory
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't,
so
then
it's
not
your
position
i
guess
perhaps
i
misunderstood
it,
i
thought
that
your
position
was
that
your
association
had
a
constitutional
right
to
choose
whomever
you
wanted
to
represent
your
members
in
claims
against
the
claims
of
the
industrial
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
you
planned
to
have
a
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
your
argument
if
you
think
that
it
has
to
be
confined
to
their
hiring
a
lawyer
i
should
think
that
this
constitutional
right
freedom
to
hire
anybody
they
want
to
represent
them
they
could,
they
could
if
they
wanted
they
want
to
hire
a
plumber
or
another
coal
miner.
justice
potter
stewart
this
barred
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
the
bar
exam?
justice
potter
stewart
no
and
that
right
derives
you
say
from
where?
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
bertrand,
you
surely
--
it
is
true
isn't
it
that
in
button,
we
got
there
with
a
virginia
system,
under
which
the
--
rather
naacp
system
in
virginia,
where
the
compensation
to
the
lawyer
on
behalf
of
the
litigants
was
not
paid
by
the
litigants
but
was
paid
by
the
naacp,
wasn't
it?
we
there
held
that
the
virginia
--
i
forget
whether
it
was
a
statute,
now
i
have
to
--
it
was
a
statute,
but
that
statute
which
--
tempted
to
prohibit
this,
did
violate
in
that
context
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
surely
on
the
constitutional
question,
you
just
can't
say
there
isn't
any
in
light
of
that
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
says
that
this
was
in
an
area
of
lawsuits
to
vindicate
political
rights,
otherwise
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
but
surely
it
didn't
decide
the
question
about
the
dispute,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
we
do
have
that
issue
before
us
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
wasn't
any
issue
presented
in
the
brotherhood
case
as
i
recall
it
and
that's
correct,
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
was
not
presented
in
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
i
didn't
state
my
question
well.
in
that
case
whether
or
not
the
brotherhood
who
was
paying
a
salary
to
a
lawyer,
that
the
issue
of
the
propriety
of
that
in
light
of
the
constitution
was
not
presented
well.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
for
the

workmen's
