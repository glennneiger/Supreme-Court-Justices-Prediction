justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
one
is
--
member
of
the
state
legislature,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
union
or
he
just
paid
his
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
he
subject
to
your
direction?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
say
you
don't
exercise
it
but
is
he
subject
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
call
him
an
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
union
has
a
lot
of
employees
i
--.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
pay
taxes
on
this
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
does
the
illinois
compensation
system
provide
for
an
award
a
fees
to
an
attorney
representing
an
injured
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
offer
to
pay
any
of
the
expenses
of
attorneys
that
some
member
may
hire
rather
than
this
man
in
the
legal
department.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
cases
are
you
relying?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
welfare
fund
i
think
that
is
separate
from
the
union
treasury
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
listed
by
separate
board
of
welfare
trustee?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
with
the
separate
and
it's
made
up
entirely
of
the
employer
contributions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
--
this
gentleman,
this
lawyer's
salary
is
not
taken
a
from
welfare
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
paid
out
of
union
dues.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
this
system
or
any
other
system.
-
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
it
were
shown
in
this
record
clearly
that
this
is
perhaps
the
best
system
for
legal
services
that
could
possibly
be
provided?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
as
the
union
here
instead
of
calling
in
an
employee
and
paying
the
salary,
just
paying
the
retainer
--
say
the
gentleman
was
in
private
practice
and
a
general
practice
or
with
a
firm
and
the
union
just
paid
him
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
you
would
not
make
the
same
argument
then
if
the
union
just
told
all
of
its
employees
go
hire
any
lawyer
you
want
and
we'll
pay
his
fee.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
combs
on
the
one
hand,
i
gather
you
would
also
argue
to
sustain
union
counsel
right
across
the
board
for
members
--
again
by
the
litigation
of
all
kind.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
all,
i
just
wanted
to
figure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
see,
this
record
contained
a
series
of
interventions
by
the
union
in
to
these
cases
with
reference
to
the
attorney
or
a
reservation
of
the
contract
to
get
the
--
employer
wants
some
thing
in
the
direction
of
the
union,
would
you
say
then
that
the
state
had
made
out
a
decent
case?
justice

a
different
case

would
then
the
