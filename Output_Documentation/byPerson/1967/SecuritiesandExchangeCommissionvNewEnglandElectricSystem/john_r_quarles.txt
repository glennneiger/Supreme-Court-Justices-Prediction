mr.
john
r.
quarles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
make
perfectly
clear
what
the
position
of
the
respondents
is
with
respect
to
the
questions
raised
by
this
case.
we
recognize
that
section
11(b)(1)
of
the
holding
company
act
as
recently
interpreted
by
this
court,
reflects
a
general
policy
favoring
the
separation
of
alleged
gas
utilities
that
the
exception
to
that
is
in
intended
to
be
a
narrow
exception
that
any
holding
company
claiming
to
come
within
the
exception
has
the
burden
of
meeting
astringent
test
and
that
that
is
a
heavy
burden.
we
do
not
question
the
commission’s
wide
experience,
its
expertise
or
its
competence
to
evaluate
the
evidence.
do
not
claim
that
the
commission
has
any
duty
to
adduce
any
evidence
or
otherwise
supply
any
deficiencies
in
the
company’s
case
neither
the
respondents
nor
the
court
below
suggested
imposing
any
burden
of
proof
on
the
commission.
what
we
do
claim
is
that
the
commission
with
administrative
agency
power
of
life
or
death
over
a
holding
company
system
has
a
correspondingly
heavy
responsibility
and
duty
to
deal
with
each
case
separately
on
its
own
merits
to
evaluate
the
evidence
by
a
fair
appraisal
of
the
evidence
in
the
light
of
its
expertise
and
experience
but
not
to
substitute
its
expertise
for
the
evidence.
we
feel
that
in
this
case
the
gravity
of
the
commission’s
responsibility
is
emphasized
by
the
finality
of
the
action
in
requiring
a
divestment.
if
in
a
doubtful
case,
judgment
is
suspended.
the
commission
retains
jurisdiction
and
counted
anytime
reopen
the
case,
their
people
begin
to
appear.
but
if
divestment
is
required
and
it
later
turns
out
to
have
been
a
mistake,
there
is
no
way
of
correcting
it.
once
that
step
is
taken,
the
damage
is
done
and
the
losses
are
irretrievable.
in
our
view,
the
basic
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
commission
has
properly
discharge
this
heavy
responsibility,
the
court
of
appeals
after
a
review
of
the
entire
record
concluded
that
it
had
not.
careful
reading
of
the
findings
and
opinion
in
this
case
as
distinguished
from
ex
post
facto
explanations
of
what
the
commission
intended
or
said,
strongly
suggest
that
what
happened
here
was
that
on
a
preliminary
inspection
of
the
figures,
the
commission
or
its
staff
observed
a
superficial
similarity
between
the
losses
shown
by
the
ebasco
report
and
losses
claimed
but
not
established
in
prior
cases
in
which
divestment
had
been
ordered
and
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
those
were
another
case
falling
in
the
same
category
and
controlled
by
pressman.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
if
there
was
a
record
of
the
performance
subsequent
to
divestment
of
any
companies
that
had
been
separated
or
it
does
not
appear
in
this
record
and
is
not
referred
to
in
these
findings
and
opinion.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
the
comparison.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no
sir.
i
was
undertaking
to
say
and
i’m
sorry
if
i
didn’t
make
it
clear
that
the
commission
relied,
rolled
up
on
a
comparison
of
the
loss
ratios
and
said
that
the
loss
here
is
no
greater
or
not
substantially
greater
than
in
other
cases
in
which
we
have
ordered
divestment.
it
said
nothing
about
what
happened
after
the
divestment.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
and
i
have
the
feeling
that
here,
the
commission
figured
that
this
was
controlled
by
the
president
and
have
a
great
conclusion,
it
thought
unnecessary
to
examine
the
record
and
formulate
its
own
findings
and
opinion
with
the
same
care
that
it
normally
exercises.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
findings
and
opinion
contains
so
many
inconsistencies
omissions
of
essential
findings
and
reasons
and
mistakes
of
fact
that
they
cannot
support
a
divestment
order.
this
really
is
the
only
theory
on
which
i’ve
been
able
to
understand
the
action
of
the
commission
in
this
case.
the
commission’s
briefs
and
argument
of
counsel
have
been
directed
very
largely
a
discrediting
severance
studies
in
general
and
ebasco
report
in
particular.
and
at
the
same
time
undertaking
thereby
to
justify
the
commission’s
reliance
on
his
own
general
information
and
expertise
instead
of
addressing
itself
to
the
specifics
of
the
case
before
it
thus
at
page
17
of
their
brief,
they
say,
“we
believe
that
given
the
highly
conjectural
nature
of
the
predictions
involved,
the
commission
must
be
guided
by
its
knowledge
of
other
public
utility
systems
and
its
experience
with
successfully
accomplished
divestitures.”
the
briefs
do
not
answer
the
serious
deficiencies
in
the
findings
and
opinion
which
i
detailed
and
i
think
adequately
documented
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
they
assume
that
there
would
be
no
change
in
the
volume
of
business
as
a
mere
result
of
the
divestiture.
there
was
evidence
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no
indication
that
it
disagreed
with
that
except
the
very
vague
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
might
be
benefits
from
separation.
there
was
ample
evidence
by
both
the
ebasco
witnesses,
the
company
witnesses
and
the
chairman
of
the
massachusetts
department
of
public
utilities
that
the
gas
companies
were
being
operated
entirely
as
if
they
were
independent
and
that
their
business
was
in
no
way
being
handicap
by
being
related
to
the
electric
company
serving
the
same
territories.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
it
can
be
a
long
stretch
but
there
is
was
accumulative
evidence
here
but
it
was
short
stretched.
much
of
the
confusion
in
this
case,
i
think
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
commission
completely
fail
to
deal
with
one
of
the
three
principal
issues
that
it
posed
in
the
order
of
notice
initiating
the
hearings
and
that
was
a
status
of
these
gas
companies.
now,
our
brother
has
referred
to
it
as
the
gas
system.
they
are
the
eight
separate
companies
whether
or
not
they
constitute
an
integrated
system
was
one
of
the
three
principal
issues.
on
that,
the
commission
has
not
taken
a
position.
it
has
stated
that
it
was
concededly
a
separate
independent
system
or
could
be,
and
the
counsel
in
successive
proceeding
--
parts
of
this
proceeding
has
given
different
explanation
of
why
the
one
that’s
given
today
is
that
the
commission’s
action
was
stated
to
be
an
expressed
reliance
on
the
staff’s
concession.
and
what
the
findings
and
opinions
say
on
this
is
that
the
companies
concededly
constitute
a
single
system.
i
read
that
to
mean
that
the
commission
was
making
the
concession.
certainly,
the
staff
is
always
recognized
throughout
these
proceedings.
it
did
have
no
authority
to
make
any
concession
of
this
kind
and
the
part
of
this
that
it
went
was
to
say
that
it
would
recommend
a
favorable
finding
to
the
commission.
the
commission
itself
has
repeatedly
held
that
it
will
not
accept
the
staff
concession
as
a
basis
even
for
its
own
determination
whether
there
must
be
evidence
and
findings
to
support
it.
in
this
very
case
in
the
earlier
phases,
dealing
with
the
electric
companies
when
the
question
was
identical,
the
commission
came
out
with
elaborate
findings
and
opinion
and
an
order
and
even
in
this
phase
of
the
case
with
respect
to
the
two
other
qualities
b
and
c,
although
the
staff
had
agreed
that
there
was
no
question,
the
commission
thought
it
necessary
to
give
the
explanation
and
to
make
a
formal
finding.
it’s
only
under
clause
a
that
there
is
no
finding
that
is
still
unexplained
and
totally
unprecedented
in
the
commission’s
brief.
the
commission
stated
as
mr.
friedman
has
mentioned
two
alternative
grounds
for
the
divestiture.
one
that
the
respondents
have
not
adequately
proved
a
loss
of
a
million
one
as
claimed,
the
other
that
even
if
proved,
it
would
not
be
deemed
substantial.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
ground,
the
commission
bases
its
action
entirely
on
a
rejection
of
the
ebasco
report
and
the
rejection
of
the
testimony
given
by
the
department
of
public
utilities.
so
the
ebasco
report
itself
and
the
commission’s
treatment
of
it
become
crucial
in
this
case.
first,
let
me
say
that
the
commission
for
all
the
suggested
infirmities,
the
commission
routinely
requires
a
severance
study
and
regularly
relies
on
it.
of
course
a
severance
study
doesn’t
purport
to
have
mathematical
exactitude.
but
it
has
to
be
expressed
in
terms
of
dollars
and
cents
as
a
starting
point
before
you
can
determine
whether
the
losses
are
to
be
deemed
substantial.
you
must
determine
what
the
losses
are
and
the
ebasco
report
was
for
that
purpose.
it
was
prepared
by
a
team
of
highly
qualified
experts,
independent
consulting
engineers
who
have
had
according
to
the
commission’s
record
wide
experience
in
the
utilities
field.
they
and
the
senior
officers
of
nees
were
working
on
this
intensively
for
about
a
year.
the
result
came
out
as
the
report
that
has
already
been
referred
to.
that
report
was
presented
and
explained
with
pens
taken
care
and
a
long
series
of
public
hearings.
the
staff
took
about
12
months
to
study
the
report
in
the
related
evidence
and
during
that
time,
they
requested
and
received
quite
a
lot
of
additional
material
from
the
company.
at
the
end,
the
hearings
where
reconvened,
the
ebasco
witnesses
were
recalled
were
so
objected
to
days
of
searching
cross-examination
that
was
frankly
directed
at
discovering
any
kind
of
weaknesses
in
the
report.
anyone
reading
a
transcript
of
the
cross-examination
of
those
witnesses,
if
found
to
be
impressed
as
the
court
of
appeals
was
by
the
wide
knowledge
of
the
utility
field
and
the
detailed
and
specific
knowledge
of
the
nees
situation
that
was
indicated
by
these
witnesses.
the
findings
and
opinion
and
the
brief
both
refer
again
and
again
to
these
serious
deficiencies.
the
inadequacies
and
a
number
of
material
aspects,
the
unexplained
anomalies,
and
other
things
of
that
kind
describing
the
so-called
effects
as
if
by
a
reputation
you
make
it
true
but
the
findings
and
opinion
actually
identified
as
suspect
only
to
relatively
minor
items
in
this
whole
massive
report.
the
petitioner
undertakes
the
liabilities
as
merely
examples
of
significant
deficiencies
resulting
from
the
commission
having
selected
two
communities
as
a
test
but
that
is
not
what
the
findings
and
opinion
says
nor
is
it
consistent
with
the
record
of
the
hearing.
one
of
the
two
alleged
deficiencies
related
to
the
possible
use
of
a
combined
billing
arrangement
for
the
gas
companies
after
separation.
and
i
think
that
the
commission’s
handling
of
this
in
the
findings
and
opinion
pretty
well
indicates
how
little
attention
the
commission
really
gave
this
case.
first
of
all,
it
said
that
the
respondents
had
not
satisfactorily
explained
why
combined
billing
couldn’t
be
used
as
a
matter
of
economy
and
then
it
said
that
ebasco
had
not
even
considered
this
as
a
possible
economical
means,
neither
those
statements
is
correct.
the
record
on
this
is
perfectly
clear
and
explicit.
it
was
examined
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
it’s
summarized
in
the
first
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
two
ebasco
witnesses
and
the
head
of
the
nees
gas
division
testified
expressly
on
the
point.
they
were
cross-examined
at
length.
the
evidence
that
they
gave
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
this
possibility
was
explored
and
was
rejected
because
they
deemed
not
economical
and
undesirable
for
other
reasons
as
well.
now,
whether
their
conclusions
are
accepted
or
not
isn’t
the
point.
the
point
is
that
this
shows
that
they
gave
a
consideration
and
the
fact
that
the
findings
and
opinions
states
that
no
consideration
was
given
to
it
or
rather
suggest
that
the
findings
and
opinion
proceeded
without
reference
to
the
record.
the
commission’s
statement
of
the
other
item
was
equally
superficial
but
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
friedman,
it
is
too
detailed
go
into
a
discussion
that’s
treated
in
both
briefs.
neither
of
these
criticisms
involved
enough
money
to
make
any
substantial
difference
in
the
result.
it
is
suggested,
however,
that
they
impair
the
credibility
of
the
rights.
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
nature
of
the
criticisms
was
not
such
as
in
anyway
to
cast
out
on
the
rest
of
the
report.
it
was
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
allocation
of
charges
and
items
of
that
kind.
the
commission’s
alternative
ground
for
its
decision
was
that
the
loss
of
a
million
one
even
if
proved
would
not
warn
the
attention
of
the
gas
companies
when
compared
with
the
losses
on
the
basis
of
which
prior
divestments
had
been
ordered.
on
reaching
this
result,
i
first
of
all
note
that
the
commission
looked
only
at
the
abstract
amount
of
the
loss
and
not
at
the
consequences.
my
brother
suggested
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
a
million
one
hundred
thousand
dollars.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
the
gross
revenue
is
about
$22
million.
the
net,
however,
comes
down
to
this
being
approximately
30%
of
the
net
available
for
security
holders.
it
is
a
ratio
that
is
higher
than
any
of
the
previous
cases
and
even
if
we
take
into
account
the
cases
in
which
the
amounts
were
clearly
pulled
out
of
the
sky
with
no
real
evidence
to
support.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
reduced
by
30%,
that
is
correct
and
would
bring
the
rate
of
return
far
below
any
that
would
be
such
as
to
attract
new
capital
and
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
massachusetts
department
of
public
utilities
would
probably
result
in
the
need
for
rate
increases.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
that
is
correct.
we
assume
that
there
would
be
no
increase
business
and
there
was
ample
evidence
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
now,
the
commission
as
i
say
in
reaching
its
result
was
looking
only
at
the
amount
in
terms
of
ratio,
yes,
but
not
at
its
effect.
and
actually,
in
the
present
position,
the
petitioner
is
saying
that
it
shouldn’t
be
expected
to
look
at
the
effect
because
that
would
require
using
its
own
phrase,
“wresting
with
uncertainties”
and
would
involving
delays
and
timing
consuming
proceedings.
now,
whatever
inconvenience
may
be
involved,
it
seems
to
me,
perfectly
evident
that
the
serious
impairment
test
that
this
court
has
prescribed
requires
the
commission
to
consider
the
effect
of
prospective
losses
in
the
light
of
the
new
situation,
not
merely
the
amount
of
the
loss
in
the
abstract.
the
commission
and
the
courts
have
regularly
taken
that
view
and
even
in
this
case
in
stating
the
applicable
statutory
standards.
the
findings
and
opinion
quoted
from
the
circuit
court’s
decision
in
the
engineers
case,
substantial
economies
must
mean
important
economies.
the
required
importance
must
relate
to
the
healthful
continuing
business
and
service
of
the
freed
utility.
again,
the
commission
by
its
own
admission
here
decided
this
case
solely
on
the
basis
of
precedent
without
any
inquiry
concerning
the
comparability
of
the
circumstances.
the
counsel
now
attempt
to
reference
to
the
prior
cases
merely
is
indicating
consistency
in
the
dealings
but
that
wasn’t
the
way
the
findings
and
opinion
treated
it.
the
findings
and
opinion
said
in
effect,
“this
is
not
substantial
when
we
compare
it
with
other
divestment
cases.”
and
when
the
respondents
of
the
massachusetts
department
of
public
utilities
presented
evidence
showing
that
the
situations
were
different
and
that
losses
here
would
have
a
more
serious
effect
in
corresponding
dollar
amount
of
losses
to
companies
near
the
source
of
natural
gas
and
who
therefore
had
a
margin,
they
rejected
that
evidence
on
the
ground
that
other
companies
in
massachusetts
were
getting
along
all
right.
and
throughout
the
brief
and
the
reply
brief,
there
is
heavy
reliance
on
the
assumed
prosperity
of
the
other
comparable
gas
companies
in
massachusetts.
first,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
they’re
comparable
except
that
they’re
both
in
massachusetts
but
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
that
is
correct
sir.
they
would
have
that
same
handicap
but
the
evidence
was
--
there
was
a
great
deal
of
evidence
of
difference
in
the
type
of
territory
served,
the
franchise
area,
the
chairman
of
the
department
of
public
utilities
particularly
emphasis
that.
the
second
point
is
that
here,
it
is
assumed
that
they
are
prospering
the
evidence
was
not,
would
not
support
that
finding.
there
was
evidence
of
some
business
difficulty
of
a
single
case
of
bankruptcy.
there
was
--
even
the
findings
and
opinion
went
no
further
than
to
say
that
the
other
companies
have
been
able
to
continue
operations
and
apparently
earned
a
satisfactory
return
which
is
quite
along
crasser
from
the
finding
that
they
are
successful.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
they
--
there
was
reporting
of
the
rate
of
return
and
the
comparison
and
some
indication
of
the
rate
of
return
going
down
58
to
59
but
the
rate
of
return
at
a
moment
in
time
for
a
single
year
or
for
two
years
is
to
a
measure
of
the
successful
company.
you
must
know
something
about
the
kind
of
service
that
they’re
rendering,
the
extent
to
which
they’re
maintaining
their
properties,
the
divert
maintenance
alone
can
maintain
a
rate
of
return
for
several
years.
so
we
come
then
to
the
question
of
the
commission
relying
on
seven
precedents
which
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
as
other
cases
in
other
times
and
other
places.
they
were
all
cases
of
divestment,
of
companies
much
closer
to
the
source
of
supply
and
that
is
significant.
but
the
more
important
thing
is
that
not
one
of
those
seven
cases
on
which
the
commission
based
its
opinion
is
really
in
point
or
really
supports
the
conclusion.
and
five
of
them,
they
did
not
say
that
it
was
not
substantial
but
rather
they
said
that
the
amount
wasn’t
shown
or
was
improved.
apparently,
the
petitioner
gets
some
comfort
or
having
admitted
that
they
were
right
on
the
other
two
in
saying
that
the
commission
had
based
the
decision
on
the
amount
not
being
substantial.
that’s
right.
but
the
amounts
in
those
other
two
cases
were
so
much
smaller
than
the
amounts
in
our
case
that
they
appear
to
have
no
particular
significance.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
so
much
smaller,
the
amount
of
the
loss
in
the
two
cases
where
the
commission
did
base
it
on
the
amount.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
the
--
i
was
referring
to
the
ration
of
the
loss
to
their
income
to
the
various
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
or
it
was
down
to
about
5%
or
6%.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
as
compared
with
the
30%
in
our
case
so
that
we,
in
our
brief
and
in
our
appendix
for
the
brief,
had
indicated
that
those
two
cases
have
no
particular
significance.
now,
i
do
want
to
get
to
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
there’s
no
where
--
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
are
of
comparable
situation.
there
was
evidence
that
they
were
not
of
comparable
situation
because
it
was
closer
to
the
gas
fields
and
therefore
had
a
much
wider
margin
of
profit
and
could
raise
their
rates
if
need
be.
whereas
here
at
the
end
of
the
line,
the
grievous
link
from
the
gas
fields
of
any
gas
distribution
systems,
they
were
under
the
handicap
and
the
commission
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
i
do
indeed
sir.
i
think
that
before
the
commission
can
—-
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no
sir
but
i
think
that
before
the
commission
can
make
that
kind
of
an
assumption,
it
must
have
more
than
appears
in
this
record
or
so
far
as
we
know
is
in
the
files
of
the
commission
even
as
to
what
is
the
condition
of
these
other
companies.
are
they
in
effect
prosperous
companies
or
are
they
not?
now,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
the
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no
sir.
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
fatal
to
it.
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
factors
that
we
need
to
be
taken
into
account
and
there
was
evidence
that
any
rate
increase
might
very
well
start
as
paralleled
that
would
be
disastrous
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
already
according
to
the
evidence
and
the
record
here,
they
were
already
operating
on
such
a
narrow
margin
or
as
the
court
below
said
on
i
think
the
term
used
was
a
small
cushion.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
the
evidence
was
to
the
contrary.
the
evidence
was
that
beginning
back
in
1955
i
believe
or
at
about
that
time,
the
company
had
made
a
very
thorough
division
of
activities
and
had
separated.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
oh
yes
and
the
territorial
overlap
was
one
of
the
things
that
give
us
the
largest
amount
of
savings.
it
was
reference
to
the
former
action
on
the
case
that
was
here
before,
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
only
question
was
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
substantial
economy
or
loss
substantial
economy.
at
that
time,
the
commission
took
the
position
that
the
only
way
the
policy
of
the
act
could
be
given
effect
as
a
practical
matter
was
by
incorporating
it
into
the
test,
making
a
very
stringent
test
that
this
court
approved.
the
test
is
stringent.
now,
we
suggest
to
you
that
having
given
effect
to
the
statute
in
that
way,
if
it
is
desirable
to
use
this
assumed
benefit
of
free
competition
to
offset
proven
losses,
there
must
be
some
showing
that
some
practical
benefit
will
come
from
that.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no
sir.
if
we
--
if
we
win
in
this
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
may
i
suggest
that
our
position
is
merely
a
question
of
particulation.
we
go
to
the
substance
of
the
commission
not
having
really
come
to
grips
with
this
case,
not
having
examining
the
facts
of
it
on
their
own
merit
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
it
then
goes
back
to
the
commission
for
reexamination
to
determine
whether
or
not
within
the
instructions
from
this
court
or
the
circuit
court,
it
is
possible
for
them
to
give
an
adequate
answer,
if
not
then
further
hearings
or
further
review
of
the
evidence.
this
does
not
end
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
make
perfectly
clear
what
the
position
of
the
respondents
is
with
respect
to
the
questions
raised
by
this
case.
we
recognize
that
section
11(b)(1)
of
the
holding
company
act
as
recently
interpreted
by
this
court,
reflects
a
general
policy
favoring
the
separation
of
alleged
gas
utilities
that
the
exception
to
that
is
in
intended
to
be
a
narrow
exception
that
any
holding
company
claiming
to
come
within
the
exception
has
the
burden
of
meeting
astringent
test
and
that
that
is
a
heavy
burden.
we
do
not
question
the
commission’s
wide
experience,
its
expertise
or
its
competence
to
evaluate
the
evidence.
do
not
claim
that
the
commission
has
any
duty
to
adduce
any
evidence
or
otherwise
supply
any
deficiencies
in
the
company’s
case
neither
the
respondents
nor
the
court
below
suggested
imposing
any
burden
of
proof
on
the
commission.
what
we
do
claim
is
that
the
commission
with
administrative
agency
power
of
life
or
death
over
a
holding
company
system
has
a
correspondingly
heavy
responsibility
and
duty
to
deal
with
each
case
separately
on
its
own
merits
to
evaluate
the
evidence
by
a
fair
appraisal
of
the
evidence
in
the
light
of
its
expertise
and
experience
but
not
to
substitute
its
expertise
for
the
evidence.
we
feel
that
in
this
case
the
gravity
of
the
commission’s
responsibility
is
emphasized
by
the
finality
of
the
action
in
requiring
a
divestment.
if
in
a
doubtful
case,
judgment
is
suspended.
the
commission
retains
jurisdiction
and
counted
anytime
reopen
the
case,
their
people
begin
to
appear.
but
if
divestment
is
required
and
it
later
turns
out
to
have
been
a
mistake,
there
is
no
way
of
correcting
it.
once
that
step
is
taken,
the
damage
is
done
and
the
losses
are
irretrievable.
in
our
view,
the
basic
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
commission
has
properly
discharge
this
heavy
responsibility,
the
court
of
appeals
after
a
review
of
the
entire
record
concluded
that
it
had
not.
careful
reading
of
the
findings
and
opinion
in
this
case
as
distinguished
from
ex
post
facto
explanations
of
what
the
commission
intended
or
said,
strongly
suggest
that
what
happened
here
was
that
on
a
preliminary
inspection
of
the
figures,
the
commission
or
its
staff
observed
a
superficial
similarity
between
the
losses
shown
by
the
ebasco
report
and
losses
claimed
but
not
established
in
prior
cases
in
which
divestment
had
been
ordered
and
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
those
were
another
case
falling
in
the
same
category
and
controlled
by
pressman.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
if
there
was
a
record
of
the
performance
subsequent
to
divestment
of
any
companies
that
had
been
separated
or
it
does
not
appear
in
this
record
and
is
not
referred
to
in
these
findings
and
opinion.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
the
comparison.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no
sir.
i
was
undertaking
to
say
and
i’m
sorry
if
i
didn’t
make
it
clear
that
the
commission
relied,
rolled
up
on
a
comparison
of
the
loss
ratios
and
said
that
the
loss
here
is
no
greater
or
not
substantially
greater
than
in
other
cases
in
which
we
have
ordered
divestment.
it
said
nothing
about
what
happened
after
the
divestment.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
and
i
have
the
feeling
that
here,
the
commission
figured
that
this
was
controlled
by
the
president
and
have
a
great
conclusion,
it
thought
unnecessary
to
examine
the
record
and
formulate
its
own
findings
and
opinion
with
the
same
care
that
it
normally
exercises.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
findings
and
opinion
contains
so
many
inconsistencies
omissions
of
essential
findings
and
reasons
and
mistakes
of
fact
that
they
cannot
support
a
divestment
order.
this
really
is
the
only
theory
on
which
i’ve
been
able
to
understand
the
action
of
the
commission
in
this
case.
the
commission’s
briefs
and
argument
of
counsel
have
been
directed
very
largely
a
discrediting
severance
studies
in
general
and
ebasco
report
in
particular.
and
at
the
same
time
undertaking
thereby
to
justify
the
commission’s
reliance
on
his
own
general
information
and
expertise
instead
of
addressing
itself
to
the
specifics
of
the
case
before
it
thus
at
page
17
of
their
brief,
they
say,
“we
believe
that
given
the
highly
conjectural
nature
of
the
predictions
involved,
the
commission
must
be
guided
by
its
knowledge
of
other
public
utility
systems
and
its
experience
with
successfully
accomplished
divestitures.”
the
briefs
do
not
answer
the
serious
deficiencies
in
the
findings
and
opinion
which
i
detailed
and
i
think
adequately
documented
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
they
assume
that
there
would
be
no
change
in
the
volume
of
business
as
a
mere
result
of
the
divestiture.
there
was
evidence
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no
indication
that
it
disagreed
with
that
except
the
very
vague
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
might
be
benefits
from
separation.
there
was
ample
evidence
by
both
the
ebasco
witnesses,
the
company
witnesses
and
the
chairman
of
the
massachusetts
department
of
public
utilities
that
the
gas
companies
were
being
operated
entirely
as
if
they
were
independent
and
that
their
business
was
in
no
way
being
handicap
by
being
related
to
the
electric
company
serving
the
same
territories.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
it
can
be
a
long
stretch
but
there
is
was
accumulative
evidence
here
but
it
was
short
stretched.
much
of
the
confusion
in
this
case,
i
think
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
commission
completely
fail
to
deal
with
one
of
the
three
principal
issues
that
it
posed
in
the
order
of
notice
initiating
the
hearings
and
that
was
a
status
of
these
gas
companies.
now,
our
brother
has
referred
to
it
as
the
gas
system.
they
are
the
eight
separate
companies
whether
or
not
they
constitute
an
integrated
system
was
one
of
the
three
principal
issues.
on
that,
the
commission
has
not
taken
a
position.
it
has
stated
that
it
was
concededly
a
separate
independent
system
or
could
be,
and
the
counsel
in
successive
proceeding
--
parts
of
this
proceeding
has
given
different
explanation
of
why
the
one
that’s
given
today
is
that
the
commission’s
action
was
stated
to
be
an
expressed
reliance
on
the
staff’s
concession.
and
what
the
findings
and
opinions
say
on
this
is
that
the
companies
concededly
constitute
a
single
system.
i
read
that
to
mean
that
the
commission
was
making
the
concession.
certainly,
the
staff
is
always
recognized
throughout
these
proceedings.
it
did
have
no
authority
to
make
any
concession
of
this
kind
and
the
part
of
this
that
it
went
was
to
say
that
it
would
recommend
a
favorable
finding
to
the
commission.
the
commission
itself
has
repeatedly
held
that
it
will
not
accept
the
staff
concession
as
a
basis
even
for
its
own
determination
whether
there
must
be
evidence
and
findings
to
support
it.
in
this
very
case
in
the
earlier
phases,
dealing
with
the
electric
companies
when
the
question
was
identical,
the
commission
came
out
with
elaborate
findings
and
opinion
and
an
order
and
even
in
this
phase
of
the
case
with
respect
to
the
two
other
qualities
b
and
c,
although
the
staff
had
agreed
that
there
was
no
question,
the
commission
thought
it
necessary
to
give
the
explanation
and
to
make
a
formal
finding.
it’s
only
under
clause
a
that
there
is
no
finding
that
is
still
unexplained
and
totally
unprecedented
in
the
commission’s
brief.
the
commission
stated
as
mr.
friedman
has
mentioned
two
alternative
grounds
for
the
divestiture.
one
that
the
respondents
have
not
adequately
proved
a
loss
of
a
million
one
as
claimed,
the
other
that
even
if
proved,
it
would
not
be
deemed
substantial.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
ground,
the
commission
bases
its
action
entirely
on
a
rejection
of
the
ebasco
report
and
the
rejection
of
the
testimony
given
by
the
department
of
public
utilities.
so
the
ebasco
report
itself
and
the
commission’s
treatment
of
it
become
crucial
in
this
case.
first,
let
me
say
that
the
commission
for
all
the
suggested
infirmities,
the
commission
routinely
requires
a
severance
study
and
regularly
relies
on
it.
of
course
a
severance
study
doesn’t
purport
to
have
mathematical
exactitude.
but
it
has
to
be
expressed
in
terms
of
dollars
and
cents
as
a
starting
point
before
you
can
determine
whether
the
losses
are
to
be
deemed
substantial.
you
must
determine
what
the
losses
are
and
the
ebasco
report
was
for
that
purpose.
it
was
prepared
by
a
team
of
highly
qualified
experts,
independent
consulting
engineers
who
have
had
according
to
the
commission’s
record
wide
experience
in
the
utilities
field.
they
and
the
senior
officers
of
nees
were
working
on
this
intensively
for
about
a
year.
the
result
came
out
as
the
report
that
has
already
been
referred
to.
that
report
was
presented
and
explained
with
pens
taken
care
and
a
long
series
of
public
hearings.
the
staff
took
about
12
months
to
study
the
report
in
the
related
evidence
and
during
that
time,
they
requested
and
received
quite
a
lot
of
additional
material
from
the
company.
at
the
end,
the
hearings
where
reconvened,
the
ebasco
witnesses
were
recalled
were
so
objected
to
days
of
searching
cross-examination
that
was
frankly
directed
at
discovering
any
kind
of
weaknesses
in
the
report.
anyone
reading
a
transcript
of
the
cross-examination
of
those
witnesses,
if
found
to
be
impressed
as
the
court
of
appeals
was
by
the
wide
knowledge
of
the
utility
field
and
the
detailed
and
specific
knowledge
of
the
nees
situation
that
was
indicated
by
these
witnesses.
the
findings
and
opinion
and
the
brief
both
refer
again
and
again
to
these
serious
deficiencies.
the
inadequacies
and
a
number
of
material
aspects,
the
unexplained
anomalies,
and
other
things
of
that
kind
describing
the
so-called
effects
as
if
by
a
reputation
you
make
it
true
but
the
findings
and
opinion
actually
identified
as
suspect
only
to
relatively
minor
items
in
this
whole
massive
report.
the
petitioner
undertakes
the
liabilities
as
merely
examples
of
significant
deficiencies
resulting
from
the
commission
having
selected
two
communities
as
a
test
but
that
is
not
what
the
findings
and
opinion
says
nor
is
it
consistent
with
the
record
of
the
hearing.
one
of
the
two
alleged
deficiencies
related
to
the
possible
use
of
a
combined
billing
arrangement
for
the
gas
companies
after
separation.
and
i
think
that
the
commission’s
handling
of
this
in
the
findings
and
opinion
pretty
well
indicates
how
little
attention
the
commission
really
gave
this
case.
first
of
all,
it
said
that
the
respondents
had
not
satisfactorily
explained
why
combined
billing
couldn’t
be
used
as
a
matter
of
economy
and
then
it
said
that
ebasco
had
not
even
considered
this
as
a
possible
economical
means,
neither
those
statements
is
correct.
the
record
on
this
is
perfectly
clear
and
explicit.
it
was
examined
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
it’s
summarized
in
the
first
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
two
ebasco
witnesses
and
the
head
of
the
nees
gas
division
testified
expressly
on
the
point.
they
were
cross-examined
at
length.
the
evidence
that
they
gave
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
this
possibility
was
explored
and
was
rejected
because
they
deemed
not
economical
and
undesirable
for
other
reasons
as
well.
now,
whether
their
conclusions
are
accepted
or
not
isn’t
the
point.
the
point
is
that
this
shows
that
they
gave
a
consideration
and
the
fact
that
the
findings
and
opinions
states
that
no
consideration
was
given
to
it
or
rather
suggest
that
the
findings
and
opinion
proceeded
without
reference
to
the
record.
the
commission’s
statement
of
the
other
item
was
equally
superficial
but
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
friedman,
it
is
too
detailed
go
into
a
discussion
that’s
treated
in
both
briefs.
neither
of
these
criticisms
involved
enough
money
to
make
any
substantial
difference
in
the
result.
it
is
suggested,
however,
that
they
impair
the
credibility
of
the
rights.
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
nature
of
the
criticisms
was
not
such
as
in
anyway
to
cast
out
on
the
rest
of
the
report.
it
was
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
allocation
of
charges
and
items
of
that
kind.
the
commission’s
alternative
ground
for
its
decision
was
that
the
loss
of
a
million
one
even
if
proved
would
not
warn
the
attention
of
the
gas
companies
when
compared
with
the
losses
on
the
basis
of
which
prior
divestments
had
been
ordered.
on
reaching
this
result,
i
first
of
all
note
that
the
commission
looked
only
at
the
abstract
amount
of
the
loss
and
not
at
the
consequences.
my
brother
suggested
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
a
million
one
hundred
thousand
dollars.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
the
gross
revenue
is
about
$22
million.
the
net,
however,
comes
down
to
this
being
approximately
30%
of
the
net
available
for
security
holders.
it
is
a
ratio
that
is
higher
than
any
of
the
previous
cases
and
even
if
we
take
into
account
the
cases
in
which
the
amounts
were
clearly
pulled
out
of
the
sky
with
no
real
evidence
to
support.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
reduced
by
30%,
that
is
correct
and
would
bring
the
rate
of
return
far
below
any
that
would
be
such
as
to
attract
new
capital
and
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
massachusetts
department
of
public
utilities
would
probably
result
in
the
need
for
rate
increases.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
that
is
correct.
we
assume
that
there
would
be
no
increase
business
and
there
was
ample
evidence
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
now,
the
commission
as
i
say
in
reaching
its
result
was
looking
only
at
the
amount
in
terms
of
ratio,
yes,
but
not
at
its
effect.
and
actually,
in
the
present
position,
the
petitioner
is
saying
that
it
shouldn’t
be
expected
to
look
at
the
effect
because
that
would
require
using
its
own
phrase,
“wresting
with
uncertainties”
and
would
involving
delays
and
timing
consuming
proceedings.
now,
whatever
inconvenience
may
be
involved,
it
seems
to
me,
perfectly
evident
that
the
serious
impairment
test
that
this
court
has
prescribed
requires
the
commission
to
consider
the
effect
of
prospective
losses
in
the
light
of
the
new
situation,
not
merely
the
amount
of
the
loss
in
the
abstract.
the
commission
and
the
courts
have
regularly
taken
that
view
and
even
in
this
case
in
stating
the
applicable
statutory
standards.
the
findings
and
opinion
quoted
from
the
circuit
court’s
decision
in
the
engineers
case,
substantial
economies
must
mean
important
economies.
the
required
importance
must
relate
to
the
healthful
continuing
business
and
service
of
the
freed
utility.
again,
the
commission
by
its
own
admission
here
decided
this
case
solely
on
the
basis
of
precedent
without
any
inquiry
concerning
the
comparability
of
the
circumstances.
the
counsel
now
attempt
to
reference
to
the
prior
cases
merely
is
indicating
consistency
in
the
dealings
but
that
wasn’t
the
way
the
findings
and
opinion
treated
it.
the
findings
and
opinion
said
in
effect,
“this
is
not
substantial
when
we
compare
it
with
other
divestment
cases.”
and
when
the
respondents
of
the
massachusetts
department
of
public
utilities
presented
evidence
showing
that
the
situations
were
different
and
that
losses
here
would
have
a
more
serious
effect
in
corresponding
dollar
amount
of
losses
to
companies
near
the
source
of
natural
gas
and
who
therefore
had
a
margin,
they
rejected
that
evidence
on
the
ground
that
other
companies
in
massachusetts
were
getting
along
all
right.
and
throughout
the
brief
and
the
reply
brief,
there
is
heavy
reliance
on
the
assumed
prosperity
of
the
other
comparable
gas
companies
in
massachusetts.
first,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
they’re
comparable
except
that
they’re
both
in
massachusetts
but
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
that
is
correct
sir.
they
would
have
that
same
handicap
but
the
evidence
was
--
there
was
a
great
deal
of
evidence
of
difference
in
the
type
of
territory
served,
the
franchise
area,
the
chairman
of
the
department
of
public
utilities
particularly
emphasis
that.
the
second
point
is
that
here,
it
is
assumed
that
they
are
prospering
the
evidence
was
not,
would
not
support
that
finding.
there
was
evidence
of
some
business
difficulty
of
a
single
case
of
bankruptcy.
there
was
--
even
the
findings
and
opinion
went
no
further
than
to
say
that
the
other
companies
have
been
able
to
continue
operations
and
apparently
earned
a
satisfactory
return
which
is
quite
along
crasser
from
the
finding
that
they
are
successful.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
they
--
there
was
reporting
of
the
rate
of
return
and
the
comparison
and
some
indication
of
the
rate
of
return
going
down
58
to
59
but
the
rate
of
return
at
a
moment
in
time
for
a
single
year
or
for
two
years
is
to
a
measure
of
the
successful
company.
you
must
know
something
about
the
kind
of
service
that
they’re
rendering,
the
extent
to
which
they’re
maintaining
their
properties,
the
divert
maintenance
alone
can
maintain
a
rate
of
return
for
several
years.
so
we
come
then
to
the
question
of
the
commission
relying
on
seven
precedents
which
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
as
other
cases
in
other
times
and
other
places.
they
were
all
cases
of
divestment,
of
companies
much
closer
to
the
source
of
supply
and
that
is
significant.
but
the
more
important
thing
is
that
not
one
of
those
seven
cases
on
which
the
commission
based
its
opinion
is
really
in
point
or
really
supports
the
conclusion.
and
five
of
them,
they
did
not
say
that
it
was
not
substantial
but
rather
they
said
that
the
amount
wasn’t
shown
or
was
improved.
apparently,
the
petitioner
gets
some
comfort
or
having
admitted
that
they
were
right
on
the
other
two
in
saying
that
the
commission
had
based
the
decision
on
the
amount
not
being
substantial.
that’s
right.
but
the
amounts
in
those
other
two
cases
were
so
much
smaller
than
the
amounts
in
our
case
that
they
appear
to
have
no
particular
significance.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
so
much
smaller,
the
amount
of
the
loss
in
the
two
cases
where
the
commission
did
base
it
on
the
amount.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
the
--
i
was
referring
to
the
ration
of
the
loss
to
their
income
to
the
various
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
or
it
was
down
to
about
5%
or
6%.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
as
compared
with
the
30%
in
our
case
so
that
we,
in
our
brief
and
in
our
appendix
for
the
brief,
had
indicated
that
those
two
cases
have
no
particular
significance.
now,
i
do
want
to
get
to
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
there’s
no
where
--
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
are
of
comparable
situation.
there
was
evidence
that
they
were
not
of
comparable
situation
because
it
was
closer
to
the
gas
fields
and
therefore
had
a
much
wider
margin
of
profit
and
could
raise
their
rates
if
need
be.
whereas
here
at
the
end
of
the
line,
the
grievous
link
from
the
gas
fields
of
any
gas
distribution
systems,
they
were
under
the
handicap
and
the
commission
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
i
do
indeed
sir.
i
think
that
before
the
commission
can
—-
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no
sir
but
i
think
that
before
the
commission
can
make
that
kind
of
an
assumption,
it
must
have
more
than
appears
in
this
record
or
so
far
as
we
know
is
in
the
files
of
the
commission
even
as
to
what
is
the
condition
of
these
other
companies.
are
they
in
effect
prosperous
companies
or
are
they
not?
now,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
the
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no
sir.
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
fatal
to
it.
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
factors
that
we
need
to
be
taken
into
account
and
there
was
evidence
that
any
rate
increase
might
very
well
start
as
paralleled
that
would
be
disastrous
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
already
according
to
the
evidence
and
the
record
here,
they
were
already
operating
on
such
a
narrow
margin
or
as
the
court
below
said
on
i
think
the
term
used
was
a
small
cushion.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
the
evidence
was
to
the
contrary.
the
evidence
was
that
beginning
back
in
1955
i
believe
or
at
about
that
time,
the
company
had
made
a
very
thorough
division
of
activities
and
had
separated.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
oh
yes
and
the
territorial
overlap
was
one
of
the
things
that
give
us
the
largest
amount
of
savings.
it
was
reference
to
the
former
action
on
the
case
that
was
here
before,
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
only
question
was
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
substantial
economy
or
loss
substantial
economy.
at
that
time,
the
commission
took
the
position
that
the
only
way
the
policy
of
the
act
could
be
given
effect
as
a
practical
matter
was
by
incorporating
it
into
the
test,
making
a
very
stringent
test
that
this
court
approved.
the
test
is
stringent.
now,
we
suggest
to
you
that
having
given
effect
to
the
statute
in
that
way,
if
it
is
desirable
to
use
this
assumed
benefit
of
free
competition
to
offset
proven
losses,
there
must
be
some
showing
that
some
practical
benefit
will
come
from
that.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no
sir.
if
we
--
if
we
win
in
this
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
may
i
suggest
that
our
position
is
merely
a
question
of
particulation.
we
go
to
the
substance
of
the
commission
not
having
really
come
to
grips
with
this
case,
not
having
examining
the
facts
of
it
on
their
own
merit
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
it
then
goes
back
to
the
commission
for
reexamination
to
determine
whether
or
not
within
the
instructions
from
this
court
or
the
circuit
court,
it
is
possible
for
them
to
give
an
adequate
answer,
if
not
then
further
hearings
or
further
review
of
the
evidence.
this
does
not
end
the
case.
thank
you.
