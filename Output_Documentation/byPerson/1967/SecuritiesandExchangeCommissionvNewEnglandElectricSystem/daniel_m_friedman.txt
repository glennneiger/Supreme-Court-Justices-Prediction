mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
for
the
second
time.
it
involves
the
validity
of
an
order
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
entered
under
section
11(b)(1)
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act,
directing
the
respondent
new
england
electric
system
which
with
convenience
i
shall
refer
to
as
nees,
to
divest
itself
of
its
gas
properties.
the
nees
is
a
registered
holding
company.
in
section
11(b)(1)
of
the
statute,
in
general
terms,
restricts
a
holding
company
to
a
single
integrated
public
utility
system
and
it
does,
however,
permit
an
exception
if
the
commission
finds
among
other
things
that
the
additional
system
cannot
be
operated
as
an
independent
system
without
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
that
would
occur
if
the
additional
system
is
retained
in
the
holding
company
system.
this
is
a
clause
a
of
11(b)(1)
which
is
the
subject
of
this
litigation.
now,
when
the
case
was
here
before,
the
question
was
the
interpretation
of
that
clause,
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
loss
of
substantial
economies.
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
a
loss
of
substantial
economies
was
shown
if
the
company
proved
a
loss
that
would
be
considered
substantial
as
a
matter
of
a
business
judgment.
this
court
reversed
holding
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
taken
too
narrow
a
view
of
the
statute
and
it’s
said
that
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
is
that
--
which
is
viewed
the
commission
consistently
had
upheld,
that
is
as
it
put
--
as
the
commission
has
put
it,
the
economy
is
so
important
as
to
cause
a
serious
impairment
of
the
additional
system.
the
question
now
before
the
court
is
not
the
interpretation
of
that
statute.
that
was
resolved
the
last
time
for
the
application
of
that
statute.
that
is,
did
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
here
correctly
hold
that
nees
had
failed
to
carry
its
burden
of
proving
that
the
divestment
of
its
gas
properties
would
entail
the
loss
of
substantial
economy?
nees
has
both
an
electric
utility
system
and
a
gas
utility
system,
and
it
has
selected
its
electric
system
as
its
principal
system
to
be
retained.
the
gas
system
has
eight
different,
separate
gas
companies,
all
located
in
massachusetts.
its
total
plant
is
about
$56
million.
its
gross
revenues
for
the
last
year
for
which
both
at
its
figures
were
available
1958
were
about
$22
million
and
it
serves
235,000
customers
approximately.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
the
gas
system,
the
eight
gas
companies.
now,
about
almost
80%
of
nees’
gas
customers
are
also
served
by
one
of
the
electric
subsidiaries
of
nees
and
there
is
an
over
exchange
--
the
areas
cover
each
other
to
the
extent
of
75%.
that
is
the
service
75%
of
the
area
in
which
the
gas
companies
have
their
franchise.
it’s
also
an
area
where
the
electric
companies
have
their
franchise.
the
gas
companies
are
organized
administratively
as
a
gas
division
and
it
has
a
centralized
management
and
operations.
the
man
who
is
the
head
of
the
gas
division
is
also
the
president
of
each
of
the
gas
companies.
and
he
in
turn
reports
directly
to
the
vice
president
for
management
of
nees,
and
nees
is
understandable
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
it
performs
a
large
variety
of
services
for
both
the
gas
and
the
electric
systems.
and
to
support
their
claim
that
divestiture
of
the
gas
properties
have
result
in
the
loss
of
substantial
economies,
nees
relied
on
a
very
elaborate
study
which
purported
to
show
in
great
detail,
exactly
how
much
more
it
would
cost
for
every
phase
of
the
gas
company’s
operations
if
they
were
required
to
operate
separately
rather
than
jointly.
the
study
was
prepared
by
a
public
utility
consultant
firm
named
ebasco.
the
study
basically
what
ebasco
did
in
making
the
study
is
as
follows.
first,
they
examined
the
gas
system
and
attended
to
decide
how
it
should
appropriately
be
organized
if
each
of
the
gas
companies
separately
was
divested
from
the
electric
system
and
you
have
eight
separate
gas
companies
operating.
they’re
decided
on
the
appropriate
organization
and
then
they
attempted
to
say
how
many
employees
each
of
the
gas
companies
would
require
for
this
operation.
then
they
made
a
determination
as
to
how
much
it
would
cost
to
run
each
of
the
gas
properties
separately.
that
is
if
they
discovered,
they
would
need
three
clerks
in
the
billing
office,
they
would
attempt
to
say
precisely
how
much
the
clerk
would
have
to
be
paid.
so
it
reached
a
composite
figure,
showing
the
total
cost
of
operating
all
of
the
gas
properties
separately.
then
they
determined
how
much
more
this
would
be
than
the
present
cost
of
operating
the
gas
property
separately
by
looking
to
the
--
primarily
to
the
allocation
on
the
books
of
the
nees
system
as
between
the
gas
and
the
electric
companies.
when
services
were
performed
and
expenses
were
incurred
by
the
nees
system,
it
allocated
part
to
gas
and
part
to
electric.
they
accepted
in
most
instances
these
allocations,
compare
them
and
reached
the
figure
showing
the
additional
expenses,
then
and
the
only
event
that
they
make
a
further
study
building
on
this
information
to
determine
how
much
less
the
expenses
would
be
if
instead
of
the
eight
gas
companies
being
operated
as
eight
separate
systems,
they
are
operated
as
a
single
system.
and
the
end
result
of
this
lengthy
analysis,
this
lengthy
study
which
occupies
three
volumes
is
they
concluded
that
upon
divestiture
of
the
gas
properties
as
a
single
system,
additional
expenses
of
approximately
one
million
and
one
hundred
dollars
would
be
incurred.
the
commission
held
two
things.
the
commission
held
first
that
because
of
various
deficiencies
and
defects
in
this
study,
it
didn’t
provide
a
reliable
basis
for
establishing
that
there
would
be
a
loss
of
substantial
economies
and
secondly
it
held
that
even
if
you
accepted
the
figure
projected
by
ebasco
that
in
the
statutory
sense
would
not
constitute
economies
that
would
be
substantial.
now,
i
think
it’s
important
in
considering
the
commission’s
decision
to
just
permit
--
indicate
precisely
what
this
study
is.
its
face,
it
seems
to
be
very
specific
and
very
exact.
they
go
down
each
company,
each
particular
function,
dollars
and
cents,
they
add
$28.00
here
and
they
say,
of
course
this
in
this
particular
function
$109.00
less.
but
basically,
what
this
study
is,
is
a
series
of
a
huge
number
of
business
judgments.
if
you
want
to
call
on
that,
perhaps
you
might
say
informed
guesses
and
they
just
do
not
have,
it
seems
to
the
commission,
the
kind
of
precision
that
this
detailed
analysis
suggest.
it
does
not
have
that
kind
of
specificity.
for
example,
it
rest
on
a
host
of
imponderable
business
decisions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
see
how
it
could
mr.
justice
when
you
try
to
find
out
how
much
more
it
would
cost
to
operate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
there
might
--
there
might
be
situations
mr.
justice.
you
could
prove
it
as
i
would
come
to
it
in
a
minute
the
thrust
of
my
argument.
it
is
that
this
kind
of
a
study
--
this
dollars
and
cents
study
basically
is
not
--
does
not
prove
loss
of
substantial
economies
in
the
sense
that
congress
used
the
term.
the
basic
test
when
we
think
the
basic
theory
on
which
the
commission
rejected
in
its
basic
floor
is
it
--
does
not
look
to
experience,
it
does
not
look
to
see
what
has
happened
to
comparable
companies
in
the
light
of
the
statutory
standard
that
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
are
economies
so
important
to
substantially
impair
the
ability
of
the
system.
we
think
the
real
focus
here
has
to
be,
all
these
economies
of
the
type,
all
these
losses
of
the
type
which
you
can
fairly
say
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
impairment
of
the
ability
of
this
system
to
stand
alone
if
it’s
not
part
for
holding
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
they
can
see
that
on
page
12
of
their
brief
that
they
have
the
affirmative
duty
of
bringing
themselves
within
this
narrow
exception.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
did
not
quarrel.
they
--
the
first
circuit
in
effect
said
that
they
didn’t
think
the
commission
had
adequately
explained
why
it
had
rejected
this.
now,
if
may
just
point
out
on
the
judgment.
the
point
i
make
on
the
judgment
fact
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
very
nature
of
this
thing,
the
very
nature
of
this
study
renders
it
inherently
a
dubious
study.
in
other
words,
the
dollar
certainty
that’s
put
on
this,
the
one
million
one
that
says,
this
is
not
that
certain,
this
is
not
a
case
where
someone
is
trying
to
determine
how
much
more
it
would
cost
if
you
put
in
a
new
generating
plan.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
mr.
justice
but
it
will
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
as
i
--
as
indicated
and
i
will
come
to
it
in
a
little
more
precision
in
the
moment,
the
commission
found
various
defects
in
the
study.
but
i
like
to
come
to
the
point
that
i
alluded
a
moment
ago
in
answer
to
justice
white’s
question
that
the
basic
flow
here
is
that
there
was
no
attempt
really
on
the
part
of
the
defendants
to
tie
this
particular
claim
of
increased
expenses
to
the
ability
of
the
gas
system
to
operate
efficiently
on
its
own.
and
not
only
was
there
no
attempt
to
show
that
by
this
study
but
in
fact
the
record
shows
and
the
commission
found
that
independent
companies
not
under
control
with
electric
systems
were
able
to
operate
successfully.
now,
there
are
two
aspects
of
this
which
i
would
like
to
discuss.
the
first
thing
deals
with
seven
independent
gas
companies
in
massachusetts.
all
of
which
was
smaller
than
nees
and
i
say
independent
in
the
sense
that
these
companies
were
not
under
common
control
with
an
electric
company
that
was
serving
the
same
area.
now,
this
seems
to
us
the
relevant
standard
because
the
respondents
have
estimated
that
80%
of
the
additional
expenses
resulting
from
the
divestiture
were
due
to
the
separation
of
the
joint
--
the
elimination
of
the
joint
operations
of
the
electric
and
the
gas
system.
and
it
seems
to
us
highly
relevant
that
if
other
gas
companies
in
the
same
area
have
been
operating
successfully
without
the
benefits,
the
alleged
benefits
i
may
say
of
being
part
of
an
electric
holding
company
system,
this
it
seems
to
us
pretty
clearly
indicates
that
the
nees
system,
larger
than
these
other
systems
should
never
have
no
trouble
doing
the
same
thing.
and
as
the
commission
put
it
at
page
815
of
the
appendix
that’s
this
little
brown
volume
as
distinguished
in
the
large
record
and
the
previous
case.
they
said
they
couldn’t
accept
this
contention
that
nees,
the
second
largest
gas
system
in
massachusetts
would
not
be
able
to
provide
management
and
service
comparable
to
that
provided
by
other
gas
utilities
in
the
state.
now,
the
commission
also
pointed
out
that
the
percentage
ratios
in
this
case,
that
is
the
ratio
between
the
amount
of
alleged
additional
expenses
in
various
operating
figures
deemed
significant
revenues,
revenue
deductions,
gross
and
net
income
were
either
less
in
this
case
--
were
less
in
this
case
or
either
less
or
not
significantly
higher
than
comparable
percentages
that
in
a
number
of
previous
cases
in
which
divestiture
had
been
ordered,
the
commission
held
was
not
substantial
in
the
statutory
sense
and
they’ve
set
that
out
in
a
table
at
page
28
of
the
appendix
attached
to
the
opinion.
and
again,
it
seems
to
us
by
the
same
kind
of
reasoning
if
the
losses
involved
on
the
divestiture
of
other
systems
were
not
significantly
greater
than
this
system
that
too
undermines
the
claim
that
the
increases
here
would
seriously
impair
the
ability
of
the
gas
system
to
operate.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
its
--
this
whole
thing
is
not
at
all
surprising
because
as
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
the
original
federal
trade
commission
report
upon
which
it
was
based.
the
debates
in
congress
indicate
that
the
congress
generally
expected
and
anticipated
that
it
would
only
be
the
small
system
that
would
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
its
separation
from
the
holding
company
system
would
seriously
impair
its
operating
abilities.
the
congress
was
aware
during
the
debates
on
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
of
the
claims
by
the
proponents
of
holding
companies
that
they
produce
great
benefits
for
the
operating
companies
and
that
they
were
also
aware
naturally
of
the
claim
that
terminating
the
holding
company
relationship
between
gas
and
electric
properties
would
result
in
additional
expenses.
but
congress
in
that
statute
made
the
value
of
judgment
that
any
alleged
benefits
of
the
holding
company
were
outweighed
by
the
benefits
to
the
public
of
breaking
up
these
systems
and
eliminating
the
great
evils
that
they
have
been
shown
to
have
and
as
the
conference
committee
report
on
the
bill
putted,
the
congress
decide
that
it
should
be
limited
to
a
single
system
unless
the
holding
company
can
show
a
real
economic
need
on
the
part
of
the
additional
integrated
system
to
be
in
the
holding
company
act.
now,
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
commission’s
decision.
the
is
the
commission
in
evaluating
the
claim
that
these
additional
expenses
would
result
in
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
took
account
of
the
fact
that
there
are
off
setting
compensating
benefits
which
in
your
two-way
gas
system
when
it
is
separated
from
an
electric
system
in
the
same
holding
company
and
when
this
case
was
here
before
this
court
recognized
this
significance
of
this
fact.
the
court
had
pointed
out
--
the
court
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
evils
that
have
resulted
from
control
of
utilities
by
holding
companies
was
the
retention
in
one
system
of
both
gas
and
electric
properties
and
the
favoring
of
one
of
these
competing
forms
of
energy
over
the
other.
the
court
also
recognized
that
the
competitive
advantages
to
be
gained
by
a
separation
of
gas
and
electric
are
difficult
to
forecast
and
it
concluded
that
the
evaluation
of
such
benefits
is
a
matter
of
commission
expertise
on
the
total
competitive
situation.
now,
i
think
these
statements
by
the
court
have
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
the
argument.
the
commission
argued
the
last
time
that
the
case
was
here
that
one
reason
for
giving
the
statute
the
broad
reading
was
because
otherwise
if
you
just
had
assessed
a
substantial
business
judgment,
the
economies
that
was
substantial
in
that
sense
there
was
no
room
for
the
commission
to
take
into
account
these
offsetting
benefits.
but
when
the
case
came
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
suggested
that
all
that
could
be
done
on
the
matter
of
off
setting
benefits
was
to
consider
them
in
interpreting
the
statute
but
once
you
have
interpreted
the
statute,
the
commission
could
not
take
account
of
these
offsetting
benefits
unless
it
was
actually
able
to
put
a
dollar
and
cents
value
on
them.
in
other
words,
i’ll
tell
you
what
the
court
of
appeals
are
saying,
the
only
way
the
commission
in
determining
whether
a
loss
of
substantial
economies
have
been
shown,
the
only
way
the
commission
in
deciding
that
question
could
take
account
of
offsetting
benefits
was
to
put
a
value
on
it
that
the
offsetting
benefits
of
competition
amount
to
$200,000.00,
a
$100,000.00
whatever
the
figure
would
be.
and
i
particularly
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
page
45
of
the
joint
appendix.
that
was
the
first
opinion
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
second
opinion
said
it
was
readopting
and
say,
it’s
at
the
top
of
page
45,
what
we
do
question
is
the
commission’s
failure
to
find
or
articulate
any
specific
or
approximate
financial
benefit
that
such
a
change
would
occasion.
this
is
in
connection
with
its
discussion
of
the
offsetting
benefits
of
competition.
now,
that
seems
to
us
robs
the
standard
of
any
meaning
because
i
don’t
see
how
you
can
take
a
fact
into
account
in
determining
what
the
statute
means
and
then
say
you
completely
exclude
it
when
you
come
to
apply
it
and
it
seems
to
us,
if
this
is
a
significant
factor
in
interpreting
the
statute,
it
can
only
be
given
significance
when
you
come
to
apply
the
statute.
now,
i
would
like
to
come
briefly
to
some
of
the
criticisms
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
of
the
commission’s
treatment
of
this
case.
we
have
said
out
in
our
brief
and
at
greater
length
in
our
reply
brief,
a
number
of
the
defects
that
the
commission
found
in
this
study
which
in
its
view
rendered
it
unreliable
as
a
basis
for
predicting
what
the
loss
of
economies
would
be
and
that
is
if
i
change
it,
what
the
additional
expenses
would
be.
i
walk
--
them
at
the
oral
argument
that
some
of
them
are
quite
detailed
and
quite
complicated
but
i
would
like
to
explain
that
basically
they’re
related
to
a
category
of
expenses
known
as
treasury
and
customer
accounting.
and
this
represented
roughly
40%
of
the
total
additional
expenses
that
ebasco
predicted
would
flow
from
the
separation
of
the
properties.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
as
i
quote
it,
“we
do
not
necessarily
criticize
the
commission
for
its
skepticism
in
the
specifics.”
i
take
it,
that
meant,
they
didn’t
criticize
the
commission
for
finding
that
there
were
some
defects
in
the
study
but
what
it
said
was,
the
commission
was
required
not
to
reject
the
study
because
of
these
defects
but
to
adjust
it
downward
to
find
out
how
much
less
than
the
amount
allegedly
established
was
shown
by
the
study
and
then
to
make
a
determination
whether
that
lesser
amount
was
substantial.
now,
the
infirmities
in
this
case
were
not
just
arithmetical
errors,
errors
in
the
sense
that
perhaps
they
used
the
wrong
figure
for
something.
they
are
we
think
basic
errors
in
the
methodology
of
the
study
and
we
think
that
where
the
study
itself
is
subject
to
this
deficiencies
that
the
commission
was
acting
well
within
its
authority
in
saying
it
could
not
accept
the
study
at
all
as
a
basis
for
predicting
the
amount
of
additional
expenses.
we
don’t
think
the
commission
was
required
to
go
through
this
study
and
after
it
had
gone
and
found
these
defects
then
to
go
ahead
and
look
at
every
single
item
and
try
to
determine
the
value
of
the
correctness
of
every
particular
additional
little
amount
estimated.
that
will
be
as
an
impossible
burden
on
the
commission.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
dealing
with
the
second
phase
of
the
case,
that
is
the
commission’s
conclusion
that
even
if
you
accepted
for
the
sake
of
argument,
the
dollar
expense
estimate
by
the
holding
company
that
this
would
be
not
substantial,
criticize
the
commission
on
the
ground
that
it
had
failed
to
address
itself
to
what
the
impact
of
these
additional
expenses
would
be
on
the
nees
gas
properties.
it
said
that
they
just
invoke
ratios
of
other
companies
and
these
are
irrelevant.
well,
in
the
first
place,
we
think
the
burden
basically
was
on
the
respondents
to
prove
that
the
effect
of
these
additional
expenses
would
be
substantially
to
impair
the
ability
of
the
nees
system.
furthermore,
it
seems
as
i
have
indicated
that
the
effect
of
such
increases
in
expenses
on
comparable
companies,
on
companies
which
have
shown
their
ability
to
operate
without
this
“the
crutch”
of
the
holding
company
support
is
the
clearest
evidence
that
this
particular
company
if
it
is
turned
lose
from
holding
company
control
similarly
would
be
able
to
stand
alone
and
i
think
i
--
that
basically,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
respondent
and
that
the
commission
here
properly
exercised
this
discretion
and
at
full
basis
for
concluding
as
it’s
stated
the
end
of
its
opinion
at
page
25
of
the
appendix
that
it
could
not
find
on
this
record
that
the
gas
companies
could
not
be
soundly
and
economically
operated
independently
of
nees
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
told
the
commission
to
take
another
look
at
this
case
that
it
had
to
answer
a
lot
of
detailed
questions
that
the
commission
was
required
to
state
in
greater
deal
to
explicate
in
great
specificity
the
reasons
for
its
decision
that
it
put
upon
the
commission
an
impossible
burden
but
it
was
asking
the
commission
to
do
things
that
we
don’t
think
the
commission
was
required
to
do.
the
burden
was
on
the
respondents.
the
burden
was
on
the
respondents
to
show
that
they
came
within
this
narrow
exception
and
we
think
the
commission
was
justified
in
concluding
that
on
this
kind
of
a
showing
they
have
not
sustained
that
burden.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
most
of
the
point
that
mr.
quarles
has
made
have
been
dealt
within
our
brief
and
replied
brief
but
i
would
like
to
refer
to
certain
specific
points
that
he
made.
first,
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
like
--
there
were
likely
to
be
offsetting
benefits.
if
the
electric
and
the
gas
system
to
have
separated
from
common
management,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
pages
20
and
21
of
the
appendix
in
the
commission’s
report
where
the
commission
said,
the
basic
competitive
position
that
exist
between
gas
and
electric
utility
service
within
the
same
locality
is
affected
by
such
vital
management
decisions,
as
the
amount
of
funds
to
be
raised
for
or
allocated
to
the
expansion
or
promotion
of
each
type
of
service.
that’s
in
the
middle
of
page
20
and
then
over
about
the
middle
of
page
21,
the
commission
said
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
presented
in
this
case,
we
cannot
conclude
that
a
management
solely
interested
in
and
devoted
to
the
gas
operations
would
not
be
able
to
advance
them
more
effectively.
now,
the
question
is
also
been
raised
as
to
what
happened
to
some
of
these
prior
systems
or
the
divested.
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
in
footnote
24
at
page
18
of
the
appendix
where
the
commission
pointed
out
that
the
nees
gas
system
is
substantially
larger
than
systems
we
have
divested
in
prior
cases
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
sighting
two
of
its
decisions.
we
found
that
several
of
those
systems
in
turn
were
larger
than
companies
that
had
demonstrated
conclusively
their
ability
to
operate
effectively
free
upholding
company
control.
on
the
question
is
to
whether
this
divested
system
would
have
the
ability
to
finance
itself
which
they’re
concerned
about.
this
testimony
which
i
didn’t
like
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
it
refer
to
footnote
5
of
our
reply
brief
at
page
13
in
which
mr.
hanson,
the
chief
financing
and
accounting
officer
of
the
nees
system
said,
he
would
expect
they
should
be
able
to
raise
capital
on
a
sound
and
economic
basis.
if
the
gas
companies
were
divested
and
created
as
a
new
system
although
they
said
probably
its
equity
financing
would
be
more
costly
than
at
the
present
time.
on
combined
billing
which
so
much
is
made
of
that
the
commission
have
no
basis
rejecting
the
claim
on
combined
billing.
we
again
have
had
a
long
footnote
on
page
2,
footnote
2
and
page
8
of
our
brief
in
which
we
pointed
out
that
ebasco
had
made
no
study
of
combined
billing
that
their
witness
testified
that
it
was
his
view
the
combined
billing
here
would
not
provide
any
advantages
to
the
gas
system.
and
then
he
was
asked,
well
if
he
were
requested
for
an
expert
opinion
by
the
management
of
the
new
independent
gas
system
would
he
so
advised
and
he
said
he
was
sorry.
he
couldn’t
answer
that
question
without
making
the
study.
and
finally,
i
just
like
to
refer
again
to
the
opinion
of
this
court
when
the
case
was
here
before
in
which
mr.
quarles
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas’
opinion,
question,
indicated
that
one
of
the
problems
would
be
as
if
these
expenses
took
place,
there
will
be
less
money
available
for
the
stockholder’s
dividends
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
given
by
mr.
justice
douglas
toward
the
end
of
his
opinion
when
he
spoke
about
the
offsetting
benefits
of
competition
from
electric
and
gas,
and
said
that
was
a
matter
for
commission
expertise
on
the
total
competitive
situation
not
merely
on
a
prediction
whether
for
example
a
gas
company
in
a
holding
company
system
would
make
more
for
investors
than
a
gas
company
converted
into
an
independent
regime
and
that’s
what
we
think
on
this
record
that
the
commission
was
required
to
deal
to
justify
in
saying
that
this
gas
company
should
be
converted
into
an
independent
regime.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
that
--
we’ve
dealt
with
that
in
our
brief.
they
have
contended
that’s
an
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rest
on
it.
there
is
a
claim
that
the
commission
is
being
inconsistent
in
accepting
the
ebasco
study
for
purposes
of
deciding
it
was
an
integrated
gas
system
but
have
not
accepting
it
for
these
purposes
what
the
commission
did.
the
staff
conceded
it
was
an
integrated
gas
system
to
get
that
issue
out
of
the
case
so
that
the
commission
could
reach
the
real
issue
in
the
case
and
we’ve
dealt
with
it
in
our
reply
brief
at
some
length
explaining
why
we
think
there
was
no
inconsistency
in
saying
that
the
commission
did
not
rely
as
we
--
on
this
study
as
a
basis
for
that
determination.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
for
the
second
time.
it
involves
the
validity
of
an
order
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
entered
under
section
11(b)(1)
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act,
directing
the
respondent
new
england
electric
system
which
with
convenience
i
shall
refer
to
as
nees,
to
divest
itself
of
its
gas
properties.
the
nees
is
a
registered
holding
company.
in
section
11(b)(1)
of
the
statute,
in
general
terms,
restricts
a
holding
company
to
a
single
integrated
public
utility
system
and
it
does,
however,
permit
an
exception
if
the
commission
finds
among
other
things
that
the
additional
system
cannot
be
operated
as
an
independent
system
without
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
that
would
occur
if
the
additional
system
is
retained
in
the
holding
company
system.
this
is
a
clause
a
of
11(b)(1)
which
is
the
subject
of
this
litigation.
now,
when
the
case
was
here
before,
the
question
was
the
interpretation
of
that
clause,
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
loss
of
substantial
economies.
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
a
loss
of
substantial
economies
was
shown
if
the
company
proved
a
loss
that
would
be
considered
substantial
as
a
matter
of
a
business
judgment.
this
court
reversed
holding
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
taken
too
narrow
a
view
of
the
statute
and
it’s
said
that
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
is
that
--
which
is
viewed
the
commission
consistently
had
upheld,
that
is
as
it
put
--
as
the
commission
has
put
it,
the
economy
is
so
important
as
to
cause
a
serious
impairment
of
the
additional
system.
the
question
now
before
the
court
is
not
the
interpretation
of
that
statute.
that
was
resolved
the
last
time
for
the
application
of
that
statute.
that
is,
did
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
here
correctly
hold
that
nees
had
failed
to
carry
its
burden
of
proving
that
the
divestment
of
its
gas
properties
would
entail
the
loss
of
substantial
economy?
nees
has
both
an
electric
utility
system
and
a
gas
utility
system,
and
it
has
selected
its
electric
system
as
its
principal
system
to
be
retained.
the
gas
system
has
eight
different,
separate
gas
companies,
all
located
in
massachusetts.
its
total
plant
is
about
$56
million.
its
gross
revenues
for
the
last
year
for
which
both
at
its
figures
were
available
1958
were
about
$22
million
and
it
serves
235,000
customers
approximately.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
the
gas
system,
the
eight
gas
companies.
now,
about
almost
80%
of
nees’
gas
customers
are
also
served
by
one
of
the
electric
subsidiaries
of
nees
and
there
is
an
over
exchange
--
the
areas
cover
each
other
to
the
extent
of
75%.
that
is
the
service
75%
of
the
area
in
which
the
gas
companies
have
their
franchise.
it’s
also
an
area
where
the
electric
companies
have
their
franchise.
the
gas
companies
are
organized
administratively
as
a
gas
division
and
it
has
a
centralized
management
and
operations.
the
man
who
is
the
head
of
the
gas
division
is
also
the
president
of
each
of
the
gas
companies.
and
he
in
turn
reports
directly
to
the
vice
president
for
management
of
nees,
and
nees
is
understandable
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
it
performs
a
large
variety
of
services
for
both
the
gas
and
the
electric
systems.
and
to
support
their
claim
that
divestiture
of
the
gas
properties
have
result
in
the
loss
of
substantial
economies,
nees
relied
on
a
very
elaborate
study
which
purported
to
show
in
great
detail,
exactly
how
much
more
it
would
cost
for
every
phase
of
the
gas
company’s
operations
if
they
were
required
to
operate
separately
rather
than
jointly.
the
study
was
prepared
by
a
public
utility
consultant
firm
named
ebasco.
the
study
basically
what
ebasco
did
in
making
the
study
is
as
follows.
first,
they
examined
the
gas
system
and
attended
to
decide
how
it
should
appropriately
be
organized
if
each
of
the
gas
companies
separately
was
divested
from
the
electric
system
and
you
have
eight
separate
gas
companies
operating.
they’re
decided
on
the
appropriate
organization
and
then
they
attempted
to
say
how
many
employees
each
of
the
gas
companies
would
require
for
this
operation.
then
they
made
a
determination
as
to
how
much
it
would
cost
to
run
each
of
the
gas
properties
separately.
that
is
if
they
discovered,
they
would
need
three
clerks
in
the
billing
office,
they
would
attempt
to
say
precisely
how
much
the
clerk
would
have
to
be
paid.
so
it
reached
a
composite
figure,
showing
the
total
cost
of
operating
all
of
the
gas
properties
separately.
then
they
determined
how
much
more
this
would
be
than
the
present
cost
of
operating
the
gas
property
separately
by
looking
to
the
--
primarily
to
the
allocation
on
the
books
of
the
nees
system
as
between
the
gas
and
the
electric
companies.
when
services
were
performed
and
expenses
were
incurred
by
the
nees
system,
it
allocated
part
to
gas
and
part
to
electric.
they
accepted
in
most
instances
these
allocations,
compare
them
and
reached
the
figure
showing
the
additional
expenses,
then
and
the
only
event
that
they
make
a
further
study
building
on
this
information
to
determine
how
much
less
the
expenses
would
be
if
instead
of
the
eight
gas
companies
being
operated
as
eight
separate
systems,
they
are
operated
as
a
single
system.
and
the
end
result
of
this
lengthy
analysis,
this
lengthy
study
which
occupies
three
volumes
is
they
concluded
that
upon
divestiture
of
the
gas
properties
as
a
single
system,
additional
expenses
of
approximately
one
million
and
one
hundred
dollars
would
be
incurred.
the
commission
held
two
things.
the
commission
held
first
that
because
of
various
deficiencies
and
defects
in
this
study,
it
didn’t
provide
a
reliable
basis
for
establishing
that
there
would
be
a
loss
of
substantial
economies
and
secondly
it
held
that
even
if
you
accepted
the
figure
projected
by
ebasco
that
in
the
statutory
sense
would
not
constitute
economies
that
would
be
substantial.
now,
i
think
it’s
important
in
considering
the
commission’s
decision
to
just
permit
--
indicate
precisely
what
this
study
is.
its
face,
it
seems
to
be
very
specific
and
very
exact.
they
go
down
each
company,
each
particular
function,
dollars
and
cents,
they
add
$28.00
here
and
they
say,
of
course
this
in
this
particular
function
$109.00
less.
but
basically,
what
this
study
is,
is
a
series
of
a
huge
number
of
business
judgments.
if
you
want
to
call
on
that,
perhaps
you
might
say
informed
guesses
and
they
just
do
not
have,
it
seems
to
the
commission,
the
kind
of
precision
that
this
detailed
analysis
suggest.
it
does
not
have
that
kind
of
specificity.
for
example,
it
rest
on
a
host
of
imponderable
business
decisions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
see
how
it
could
mr.
justice
when
you
try
to
find
out
how
much
more
it
would
cost
to
operate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
there
might
--
there
might
be
situations
mr.
justice.
you
could
prove
it
as
i
would
come
to
it
in
a
minute
the
thrust
of
my
argument.
it
is
that
this
kind
of
a
study
--
this
dollars
and
cents
study
basically
is
not
--
does
not
prove
loss
of
substantial
economies
in
the
sense
that
congress
used
the
term.
the
basic
test
when
we
think
the
basic
theory
on
which
the
commission
rejected
in
its
basic
floor
is
it
--
does
not
look
to
experience,
it
does
not
look
to
see
what
has
happened
to
comparable
companies
in
the
light
of
the
statutory
standard
that
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
are
economies
so
important
to
substantially
impair
the
ability
of
the
system.
we
think
the
real
focus
here
has
to
be,
all
these
economies
of
the
type,
all
these
losses
of
the
type
which
you
can
fairly
say
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
impairment
of
the
ability
of
this
system
to
stand
alone
if
it’s
not
part
for
holding
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
they
can
see
that
on
page
12
of
their
brief
that
they
have
the
affirmative
duty
of
bringing
themselves
within
this
narrow
exception.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
did
not
quarrel.
they
--
the
first
circuit
in
effect
said
that
they
didn’t
think
the
commission
had
adequately
explained
why
it
had
rejected
this.
now,
if
may
just
point
out
on
the
judgment.
the
point
i
make
on
the
judgment
fact
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
very
nature
of
this
thing,
the
very
nature
of
this
study
renders
it
inherently
a
dubious
study.
in
other
words,
the
dollar
certainty
that’s
put
on
this,
the
one
million
one
that
says,
this
is
not
that
certain,
this
is
not
a
case
where
someone
is
trying
to
determine
how
much
more
it
would
cost
if
you
put
in
a
new
generating
plan.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
mr.
justice
but
it
will
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
as
i
--
as
indicated
and
i
will
come
to
it
in
a
little
more
precision
in
the
moment,
the
commission
found
various
defects
in
the
study.
but
i
like
to
come
to
the
point
that
i
alluded
a
moment
ago
in
answer
to
justice
white’s
question
that
the
basic
flow
here
is
that
there
was
no
attempt
really
on
the
part
of
the
defendants
to
tie
this
particular
claim
of
increased
expenses
to
the
ability
of
the
gas
system
to
operate
efficiently
on
its
own.
and
not
only
was
there
no
attempt
to
show
that
by
this
study
but
in
fact
the
record
shows
and
the
commission
found
that
independent
companies
not
under
control
with
electric
systems
were
able
to
operate
successfully.
now,
there
are
two
aspects
of
this
which
i
would
like
to
discuss.
the
first
thing
deals
with
seven
independent
gas
companies
in
massachusetts.
all
of
which
was
smaller
than
nees
and
i
say
independent
in
the
sense
that
these
companies
were
not
under
common
control
with
an
electric
company
that
was
serving
the
same
area.
now,
this
seems
to
us
the
relevant
standard
because
the
respondents
have
estimated
that
80%
of
the
additional
expenses
resulting
from
the
divestiture
were
due
to
the
separation
of
the
joint
--
the
elimination
of
the
joint
operations
of
the
electric
and
the
gas
system.
and
it
seems
to
us
highly
relevant
that
if
other
gas
companies
in
the
same
area
have
been
operating
successfully
without
the
benefits,
the
alleged
benefits
i
may
say
of
being
part
of
an
electric
holding
company
system,
this
it
seems
to
us
pretty
clearly
indicates
that
the
nees
system,
larger
than
these
other
systems
should
never
have
no
trouble
doing
the
same
thing.
and
as
the
commission
put
it
at
page
815
of
the
appendix
that’s
this
little
brown
volume
as
distinguished
in
the
large
record
and
the
previous
case.
they
said
they
couldn’t
accept
this
contention
that
nees,
the
second
largest
gas
system
in
massachusetts
would
not
be
able
to
provide
management
and
service
comparable
to
that
provided
by
other
gas
utilities
in
the
state.
now,
the
commission
also
pointed
out
that
the
percentage
ratios
in
this
case,
that
is
the
ratio
between
the
amount
of
alleged
additional
expenses
in
various
operating
figures
deemed
significant
revenues,
revenue
deductions,
gross
and
net
income
were
either
less
in
this
case
--
were
less
in
this
case
or
either
less
or
not
significantly
higher
than
comparable
percentages
that
in
a
number
of
previous
cases
in
which
divestiture
had
been
ordered,
the
commission
held
was
not
substantial
in
the
statutory
sense
and
they’ve
set
that
out
in
a
table
at
page
28
of
the
appendix
attached
to
the
opinion.
and
again,
it
seems
to
us
by
the
same
kind
of
reasoning
if
the
losses
involved
on
the
divestiture
of
other
systems
were
not
significantly
greater
than
this
system
that
too
undermines
the
claim
that
the
increases
here
would
seriously
impair
the
ability
of
the
gas
system
to
operate.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
its
--
this
whole
thing
is
not
at
all
surprising
because
as
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
the
original
federal
trade
commission
report
upon
which
it
was
based.
the
debates
in
congress
indicate
that
the
congress
generally
expected
and
anticipated
that
it
would
only
be
the
small
system
that
would
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
its
separation
from
the
holding
company
system
would
seriously
impair
its
operating
abilities.
the
congress
was
aware
during
the
debates
on
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
of
the
claims
by
the
proponents
of
holding
companies
that
they
produce
great
benefits
for
the
operating
companies
and
that
they
were
also
aware
naturally
of
the
claim
that
terminating
the
holding
company
relationship
between
gas
and
electric
properties
would
result
in
additional
expenses.
but
congress
in
that
statute
made
the
value
of
judgment
that
any
alleged
benefits
of
the
holding
company
were
outweighed
by
the
benefits
to
the
public
of
breaking
up
these
systems
and
eliminating
the
great
evils
that
they
have
been
shown
to
have
and
as
the
conference
committee
report
on
the
bill
putted,
the
congress
decide
that
it
should
be
limited
to
a
single
system
unless
the
holding
company
can
show
a
real
economic
need
on
the
part
of
the
additional
integrated
system
to
be
in
the
holding
company
act.
now,
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
commission’s
decision.
the
is
the
commission
in
evaluating
the
claim
that
these
additional
expenses
would
result
in
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
took
account
of
the
fact
that
there
are
off
setting
compensating
benefits
which
in
your
two-way
gas
system
when
it
is
separated
from
an
electric
system
in
the
same
holding
company
and
when
this
case
was
here
before
this
court
recognized
this
significance
of
this
fact.
the
court
had
pointed
out
--
the
court
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
evils
that
have
resulted
from
control
of
utilities
by
holding
companies
was
the
retention
in
one
system
of
both
gas
and
electric
properties
and
the
favoring
of
one
of
these
competing
forms
of
energy
over
the
other.
the
court
also
recognized
that
the
competitive
advantages
to
be
gained
by
a
separation
of
gas
and
electric
are
difficult
to
forecast
and
it
concluded
that
the
evaluation
of
such
benefits
is
a
matter
of
commission
expertise
on
the
total
competitive
situation.
now,
i
think
these
statements
by
the
court
have
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
the
argument.
the
commission
argued
the
last
time
that
the
case
was
here
that
one
reason
for
giving
the
statute
the
broad
reading
was
because
otherwise
if
you
just
had
assessed
a
substantial
business
judgment,
the
economies
that
was
substantial
in
that
sense
there
was
no
room
for
the
commission
to
take
into
account
these
offsetting
benefits.
but
when
the
case
came
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
suggested
that
all
that
could
be
done
on
the
matter
of
off
setting
benefits
was
to
consider
them
in
interpreting
the
statute
but
once
you
have
interpreted
the
statute,
the
commission
could
not
take
account
of
these
offsetting
benefits
unless
it
was
actually
able
to
put
a
dollar
and
cents
value
on
them.
in
other
words,
i’ll
tell
you
what
the
court
of
appeals
are
saying,
the
only
way
the
commission
in
determining
whether
a
loss
of
substantial
economies
have
been
shown,
the
only
way
the
commission
in
deciding
that
question
could
take
account
of
offsetting
benefits
was
to
put
a
value
on
it
that
the
offsetting
benefits
of
competition
amount
to
$200,000.00,
a
$100,000.00
whatever
the
figure
would
be.
and
i
particularly
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
page
45
of
the
joint
appendix.
that
was
the
first
opinion
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
second
opinion
said
it
was
readopting
and
say,
it’s
at
the
top
of
page
45,
what
we
do
question
is
the
commission’s
failure
to
find
or
articulate
any
specific
or
approximate
financial
benefit
that
such
a
change
would
occasion.
this
is
in
connection
with
its
discussion
of
the
offsetting
benefits
of
competition.
now,
that
seems
to
us
robs
the
standard
of
any
meaning
because
i
don’t
see
how
you
can
take
a
fact
into
account
in
determining
what
the
statute
means
and
then
say
you
completely
exclude
it
when
you
come
to
apply
it
and
it
seems
to
us,
if
this
is
a
significant
factor
in
interpreting
the
statute,
it
can
only
be
given
significance
when
you
come
to
apply
the
statute.
now,
i
would
like
to
come
briefly
to
some
of
the
criticisms
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
of
the
commission’s
treatment
of
this
case.
we
have
said
out
in
our
brief
and
at
greater
length
in
our
reply
brief,
a
number
of
the
defects
that
the
commission
found
in
this
study
which
in
its
view
rendered
it
unreliable
as
a
basis
for
predicting
what
the
loss
of
economies
would
be
and
that
is
if
i
change
it,
what
the
additional
expenses
would
be.
i
walk
--
them
at
the
oral
argument
that
some
of
them
are
quite
detailed
and
quite
complicated
but
i
would
like
to
explain
that
basically
they’re
related
to
a
category
of
expenses
known
as
treasury
and
customer
accounting.
and
this
represented
roughly
40%
of
the
total
additional
expenses
that
ebasco
predicted
would
flow
from
the
separation
of
the
properties.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
as
i
quote
it,
“we
do
not
necessarily
criticize
the
commission
for
its
skepticism
in
the
specifics.”
i
take
it,
that
meant,
they
didn’t
criticize
the
commission
for
finding
that
there
were
some
defects
in
the
study
but
what
it
said
was,
the
commission
was
required
not
to
reject
the
study
because
of
these
defects
but
to
adjust
it
downward
to
find
out
how
much
less
than
the
amount
allegedly
established
was
shown
by
the
study
and
then
to
make
a
determination
whether
that
lesser
amount
was
substantial.
now,
the
infirmities
in
this
case
were
not
just
arithmetical
errors,
errors
in
the
sense
that
perhaps
they
used
the
wrong
figure
for
something.
they
are
we
think
basic
errors
in
the
methodology
of
the
study
and
we
think
that
where
the
study
itself
is
subject
to
this
deficiencies
that
the
commission
was
acting
well
within
its
authority
in
saying
it
could
not
accept
the
study
at
all
as
a
basis
for
predicting
the
amount
of
additional
expenses.
we
don’t
think
the
commission
was
required
to
go
through
this
study
and
after
it
had
gone
and
found
these
defects
then
to
go
ahead
and
look
at
every
single
item
and
try
to
determine
the
value
of
the
correctness
of
every
particular
additional
little
amount
estimated.
that
will
be
as
an
impossible
burden
on
the
commission.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
dealing
with
the
second
phase
of
the
case,
that
is
the
commission’s
conclusion
that
even
if
you
accepted
for
the
sake
of
argument,
the
dollar
expense
estimate
by
the
holding
company
that
this
would
be
not
substantial,
criticize
the
commission
on
the
ground
that
it
had
failed
to
address
itself
to
what
the
impact
of
these
additional
expenses
would
be
on
the
nees
gas
properties.
it
said
that
they
just
invoke
ratios
of
other
companies
and
these
are
irrelevant.
well,
in
the
first
place,
we
think
the
burden
basically
was
on
the
respondents
to
prove
that
the
effect
of
these
additional
expenses
would
be
substantially
to
impair
the
ability
of
the
nees
system.
furthermore,
it
seems
as
i
have
indicated
that
the
effect
of
such
increases
in
expenses
on
comparable
companies,
on
companies
which
have
shown
their
ability
to
operate
without
this
“the
crutch”
of
the
holding
company
support
is
the
clearest
evidence
that
this
particular
company
if
it
is
turned
lose
from
holding
company
control
similarly
would
be
able
to
stand
alone
and
i
think
i
--
that
basically,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
respondent
and
that
the
commission
here
properly
exercised
this
discretion
and
at
full
basis
for
concluding
as
it’s
stated
the
end
of
its
opinion
at
page
25
of
the
appendix
that
it
could
not
find
on
this
record
that
the
gas
companies
could
not
be
soundly
and
economically
operated
independently
of
nees
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
told
the
commission
to
take
another
look
at
this
case
that
it
had
to
answer
a
lot
of
detailed
questions
that
the
commission
was
required
to
state
in
greater
deal
to
explicate
in
great
specificity
the
reasons
for
its
decision
that
it
put
upon
the
commission
an
impossible
burden
but
it
was
asking
the
commission
to
do
things
that
we
don’t
think
the
commission
was
required
to
do.
the
burden
was
on
the
respondents.
the
burden
was
on
the
respondents
to
show
that
they
came
within
this
narrow
exception
and
we
think
the
commission
was
justified
in
concluding
that
on
this
kind
of
a
showing
they
have
not
sustained
that
burden.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
most
of
the
point
that
mr.
quarles
has
made
have
been
dealt
within
our
brief
and
replied
brief
but
i
would
like
to
refer
to
certain
specific
points
that
he
made.
first,
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
like
--
there
were
likely
to
be
offsetting
benefits.
if
the
electric
and
the
gas
system
to
have
separated
from
common
management,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
pages
20
and
21
of
the
appendix
in
the
commission’s
report
where
the
commission
said,
the
basic
competitive
position
that
exist
between
gas
and
electric
utility
service
within
the
same
locality
is
affected
by
such
vital
management
decisions,
as
the
amount
of
funds
to
be
raised
for
or
allocated
to
the
expansion
or
promotion
of
each
type
of
service.
that’s
in
the
middle
of
page
20
and
then
over
about
the
middle
of
page
21,
the
commission
said
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
presented
in
this
case,
we
cannot
conclude
that
a
management
solely
interested
in
and
devoted
to
the
gas
operations
would
not
be
able
to
advance
them
more
effectively.
now,
the
question
is
also
been
raised
as
to
what
happened
to
some
of
these
prior
systems
or
the
divested.
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
in
footnote
24
at
page
18
of
the
appendix
where
the
commission
pointed
out
that
the
nees
gas
system
is
substantially
larger
than
systems
we
have
divested
in
prior
cases
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
sighting
two
of
its
decisions.
we
found
that
several
of
those
systems
in
turn
were
larger
than
companies
that
had
demonstrated
conclusively
their
ability
to
operate
effectively
free
upholding
company
control.
on
the
question
is
to
whether
this
divested
system
would
have
the
ability
to
finance
itself
which
they’re
concerned
about.
this
testimony
which
i
didn’t
like
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
it
refer
to
footnote
5
of
our
reply
brief
at
page
13
in
which
mr.
hanson,
the
chief
financing
and
accounting
officer
of
the
nees
system
said,
he
would
expect
they
should
be
able
to
raise
capital
on
a
sound
and
economic
basis.
if
the
gas
companies
were
divested
and
created
as
a
new
system
although
they
said
probably
its
equity
financing
would
be
more
costly
than
at
the
present
time.
on
combined
billing
which
so
much
is
made
of
that
the
commission
have
no
basis
rejecting
the
claim
on
combined
billing.
we
again
have
had
a
long
footnote
on
page
2,
footnote
2
and
page
8
of
our
brief
in
which
we
pointed
out
that
ebasco
had
made
no
study
of
combined
billing
that
their
witness
testified
that
it
was
his
view
the
combined
billing
here
would
not
provide
any
advantages
to
the
gas
system.
and
then
he
was
asked,
well
if
he
were
requested
for
an
expert
opinion
by
the
management
of
the
new
independent
gas
system
would
he
so
advised
and
he
said
he
was
sorry.
he
couldn’t
answer
that
question
without
making
the
study.
and
finally,
i
just
like
to
refer
again
to
the
opinion
of
this
court
when
the
case
was
here
before
in
which
mr.
quarles
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas’
opinion,
question,
indicated
that
one
of
the
problems
would
be
as
if
these
expenses
took
place,
there
will
be
less
money
available
for
the
stockholder’s
dividends
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
given
by
mr.
justice
douglas
toward
the
end
of
his
opinion
when
he
spoke
about
the
offsetting
benefits
of
competition
from
electric
and
gas,
and
said
that
was
a
matter
for
commission
expertise
on
the
total
competitive
situation
not
merely
on
a
prediction
whether
for
example
a
gas
company
in
a
holding
company
system
would
make
more
for
investors
than
a
gas
company
converted
into
an
independent
regime
and
that’s
what
we
think
on
this
record
that
the
commission
was
required
to
deal
to
justify
in
saying
that
this
gas
company
should
be
converted
into
an
independent
regime.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
that
--
we’ve
dealt
with
that
in
our
brief.
they
have
contended
that’s
an
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rest
on
it.
there
is
a
claim
that
the
commission
is
being
inconsistent
in
accepting
the
ebasco
study
for
purposes
of
deciding
it
was
an
integrated
gas
system
but
have
not
accepting
it
for
these
purposes
what
the
commission
did.
the
staff
conceded
it
was
an
integrated
gas
system
to
get
that
issue
out
of
the
case
so
that
the
commission
could
reach
the
real
issue
in
the
case
and
we’ve
dealt
with
it
in
our
reply
brief
at
some
length
explaining
why
we
think
there
was
no
inconsistency
in
saying
that
the
commission
did
not
rely
as
we
--
on
this
study
as
a
basis
for
that
determination.
thank
you.
