justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
i
understand
your
position,
let's
see
if
i
do,
it
is
this,
that
if
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
i
mean
the
court
of
claims,
we
will
necessarily
be
deciding
that
the
tribes
still
has
hunting
and
fishing
rights
and
that
it
is
not
entitled
to
compensation
from
the
united
states,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
i
mean
to
say,
if
we
just
affirm
the
court
of
claims
and
confine
our
affirmance,
whatever
techniques
we
use
but
confine
our
affirmance
to
the
reasoning
stated
by
the
court
of
claims
in
that
effect
would
be
that
the
tribe
is
not
entitled
to
just
compensation
but
that
the
tribe
does
have
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
pretty
hard
to
reconcile
the
statutes,
isn't
it,
mr.
hobbs?
let
me
run
through
a
few
things
on
the
statute
if
you
don't
mind.
on
the
first
place,
i'm
looking
at
the
u.s.
code
which
is
used
here,
section
896
says
that
the
secretary
shall
accept
the
tribal
plan
as
you
have
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
effect,
they
shall
accept
the
tribal
plan
as
the
basis
for
the
conveyance
of
the
tribal
property,
for
the
conveyance
of
the
property
as
provided
by
the
tribal
plan
in
determining
this.
if
he'd
find
that
it
would
treat
with
reasonable
equity,
all
members
on
the
final
roll
of
the
tribe
are
prepared
as
of
june
17,
1954.
and
so
number
1,
we
have
all
of
the
tribal
property
conveyed
to
this
corporation,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
didn't
what
the
language
says.
is
there
some
qualification
elsewhere?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
second
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
all
--
now
that
says
that
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
transfer
to
the
tribal
property
the
title
of
all
property
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
that
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
particularization
of
896.
and
if
you
tell
me
that
this
is
wrong,
why
--
i
wouldn't
get
your
opinion
on
it.
they
say
is
that
construction
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
my
construction
of
this
just
casually
by
looking
at
it
here
is
number
1,
the
secretary
transfers
to
the
corporation
all
of
the
trust
property.
number
2,
that
the
plan
submitted
according
to
the
statute,
statute
contemplated
if
the
plans
submitted
would
contemplate
that
all
travel
property,
trust
property
or
not
would
be
placed
in
the
corporation.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
alright,
i
don't
think
we
got
a
meeting
of
the
minds
on
the
problem
here.
now
take
a
look
at
section
899,
because
i
don't
recall
being
commented
on
your
brief.
section
899
provides
that:
“thereafter,
that
is
say,
a
transfer
of
the
property
of
the
tribe.
the
individual
members
of
the
tribe
shall
not
be
entitled
to
services
performed
by
the
united
states
for
indians.”
and
you
look
further
down:
“all
statutes
of
the
united
states
which
shall
affect
indians
because
of
their
status
as
indians,
shall
no
longer
be
applicable
to
the
members
of
the
tribe”.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
contrary
to
argued
and
i
may
be
wrong
about
this,
contrary
to
what
you
argued
a
few
moments
ago,
that
statute
did
contemplate
that
upon
the
setting
up
of
this
corporation
transferred
to
it
of
the
tribal
property,
there
would
be
a
termination
of
the
status
of
the
menominees
as
indians
in
those
respects
that
are
peculiar
to
our
law
with
respect
to
indians.
now,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
the
real
question
is
--
are
for
purposes
of
the
problem
that
you
are
interested
in
here
is
whether
the
tribe
in
effect
survives
as
any
other
voluntary
organization
might
survive
or
whether
the
tribe
survives
with
the
special
and
peculiar
attributes
that
indian
tribes
have
under
our
laws
and
treaties
and
by
virtue
or
beyond
the
basic
and
underlying
relationship.
that's
the
question
it
seems
to
me
under
this
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
one
further
thing
here.
take
a
look
if
you
will
at
--
about
the
--
towards
the
end
of
section
896
as
following
the
language.
the
responsibility
of
the
united
states
to
furnish
all
such
supervision
and
services
to
the
tribe
and
the
members
thereof
because
of
their
status
as
indians
shall
cease
on
april
30,
1961.
the
plan
shall
contain
provision
for
protection
of
the
forest
on
a
sustained
yield
basis
and
for
the
protection
of
the
water,
soil,
fish
and
wildlife.
now,
that
would
indicate
the
plan
contained
provisions
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
the
corporation,
does
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
provision
would
--
contemplated
that
the
corporation
would
be
in
effect
a
custodian
of
whatever
rights
the
indians
might
have
in
the
forest
and
the
wildlife.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
bothers
me,
we're
handicapped
here
because
if
--
to
my
mind
or
expect
that
i
might
change
my
mind
on
further
study.
i
don't
think
these
questions
are
fully
briefed
in
terms
of
statute
and
that's
because
--
perhaps
because
of
a
peculiar
way
in
which
it
comes
up
here.
but
as
i
read
the
statute,
it's
arguable
at
least
that
there
was
an
intent
to
transfer
all
of
the
tribal
property,
including
the
forest,
whatever
--
rights
in
the
wildlife,
etcetera
to
this
corporation.
that
upon
such
transfer
and
pursuant
to
plan,
which
i
have
not
seen,
the
indians,
the
menominee
indians
seeks
to
have
any
benefits
from
their
status
as
indians
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
that
in
effect,
what
happened
here
is
a
--
whether
one
likes
it
or
not,
whether
one
considers
it
decent
or
indecent
and
why
in
effect
what
happened
here
was
a
transfer
of
tribal
ownership
and
responsibilities
from
the
tribal
hands
into
a
corporation
which
in
turn
was
owned
by
the
indians.
and
the
indians,
meaning
only
those
indians
whose
names
appeared
on
the
roll
as
of
june
17,
1954.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
roll
as
of
that
date?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
any
rights
in
the
corporate
property
that
other
--
that
their
children
might
have
would
be
rights
devolved
and
upon
their
children
as
a
result
of
a
stock
of
an
inheritance?
justice
abe
fortas
not
because
they're
indians?
not
because
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
menominee
indians
but
because
their
parents
own
a
stock.
this
plan
provides
for
--
is
the
plan
inhibits
the
indians
from
an
individual
indian
from
transferring
outside
of
the
tribe
his
ownership
interest
in
the
cooperation?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
what
happens
with
respect
to
hunting
and
fishing
rights?
90
--
year
1975
its
no
longer
very
far
away.
i
suppose
up
to
1975
the
tribe
doesn't
exercise
its
right
of
first
refusal,
the
state
of
wisconsin
does
not
but
some
stock
is
transferred
to
private
people.
and
who
has
these
rights
of
hunting
and
fishing
for
which
you
are
trying
to
vindicate
in
this
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
whether
you
have
to
decide
it
or
not
but
i
sure
have
to
think
it
through.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
hobbs,
i
call
your
attention
on
words
that
i
read
a
few
minutes
ago
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
tribe
owns
the
forest,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
tribe
own
--
has
a
wildlife
rights.
that
there
was
--
have
gone
to
the
corporation,
am
i
wrong
there,
you
disagree
there?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
show
me
something
in
the
statute
that
says
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
any
more
of
your
time.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
don't
really
want
to
say
that,
do
you?
i
can
understand
that
the
point
of
view
of
some
other
counsel,
not
yourself
that
the
claim
to
just
compensation
might
be
more
attractive
but
your
client,
the
tribe,
wants
you
to
insist
upon
the
--
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
claims
so
that
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights
can
be
vindicated.
justice
abe
fortas
and
they're
entitled
to
--
if
there's
anyway
that
you
can
work
it
out,
i'm
sure
you
wanted
to
try
to
work
it
out
so
that
this
court
considers
that
request
and
not
that
you
withdraw
it
here.
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
and
we
have
from
the
government
a
brief
that's
very
short
for
which
we're
all
unusually
very
grateful
at
this
time
but
in
this
particular
situation
i
think
what
we're
being
asked
to
do
is
to
consider
for
the
first
time
some
really
fundamental
problems
relating
to
the
startling
events
that
occurred
with
respect
to
the
indians
and
these
termination
acts.
consider
that
really
for
the
first
time
without
adversary
positions
being
expressed
here
on
the
basis
of
--
well
if
i
may
say
so
is,
a
presentation
in
the
written
material
that
doesn't
give
us
some
benefit
of
all
the
learning
then
i'm
sure
that
you
and
mr.
hobbs
have
on
these
subjects
and
primarily
the
analysis
of
this
statute.
and
you're
now
telling
us
that
in
your
view,
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
belong
to
the
tribes
and
still
belong
to
the
tribes,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
how
can
you
say
it
that
way
--
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
statute
expressly
says
that
the
tribal
roll
is
made
as
of
this
date
in
1954
and
thereafter
it
ceases.
it
can't
add
to
that.
they
became
citizens.
their
citizenship
is
protected
by
a
provision
in
this
statute
and
there
is
no
longer
anything
on
the
federal
law
they
call
the
tribal
roll
and
they
don't
have
rights
as
indians.
justice
abe
fortas
the
final
tribal
roll
but
these
same
indians
aren't
going
to
survive
forever
and
ever.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
claiborne,
do
you
know
whether
the
state
of
wisconsin
disagrees
with
you
on
both
of
those
and
points
and
if
so,
to
what
extent?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
does
the
state
of
wisconsin
take
the
position
that
the
indians
have
to
allow
other
people
to
come
on
the
former
reservation,
what
was
the
reservation
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
allow
them
to
fish
and
hunt?
justice
abe
fortas
but
do
you
take
the
position
that
this
area,
the
forest
land
are
owned
by
the
tribe
or
by
the
corporation
or
by
the
enrolled
indians
anyone
of
those
three
for
present
purposes,
you
take
the
position
that
they
have
an
ownership
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
if
--
that
then
the
right
to
exclude
others
would
--
there
is
not
--
something
that's
derived
from
the
state
that
says
indian,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
clairborne,
as
you
see
this,
does
the
state
of
wisconsin
have
any
regulatory
or
other
rights
with
respect
to
hunting
and
fishing
by
the
menominee
is
that
--
than
the
federal
government
had?
does
the
state
have
more
rights,
more
powers
than
the
federal
government
have?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
from
your
point
of
view
which
you
would
do
would
be
to
find
out
what
the
federal
rights
were
and
then
assume
that
those
or
some
of
them
were
transferred
to
the
state
but
the
fact
is
they
limit
of
what
is
transferred
to
the
state
and
from
--
in
that
way
you'd
get
some
indication
of
what
the
state
regulatory
powers
are.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
know
that,
mr.
claiborne,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
--
and
as
you
have
recognized
here
that
your
analysis
would
require
you
to
as
--
in
ascertaining
what
the
powers
of
the
wisconsin
act
to
start
with
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
otherwise,
the
federal
government
is
given
the
states
something
that
the
federal
government
did
not
have.
and
if
that
is
effective,
then
there
has
been
a
taking,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
as
mr.
justice
black
was
suggesting,
there
was
a
--
as
i
remember
it,
a
very
strong
philosophy
here
to
the
effect
that
the
indian
separate
property
and
the
tribal
property
in
effect
ought
to
be
disestablished
and
that
there
ought
to
be
a
mechanism
for
the
gradual
liquidation
of
tribal
property
as
an
enclave
in
the
general
economic
system.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
are
either
in
exactly
the
same
posture,
exactly
the
reverse
posture,
is
that
right
and
rather
that
either
way
on
conventional
legal
reasoning.
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
--
this
is
an
important
step
in
your
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
forgive
me
--
forgive
me
but
to
get
back
to
the
ownership
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
is
it
your
argument
that
those
were
owned
by
the
tribe
--
total
title
is
in
the
tribe
or
that
those
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
owned
by
the
members
of
the
tribe?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
argument
is
that
the
menominee
termination
in
fact
did
not
terminate
the
existence
of
the
tribe.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
merely
terminated
the
federal
supervision
of
the
tribe.
justice
abe
fortas
of
the
tribe's
sovereign
powers.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
the
tribes
continued
has
some
kind
of
an
entity,
legal,
mystical
or
otherwise
for
purposes
of
continued
ownership
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
it
could
be
a
serious
question
when
that
is
to
whether
the
indians
could
transfer
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights
an
unincorporated
association
without
destroying
them.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
your
position
is
that
the
membership
corporation
is
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
ownership
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
right.
justice
abe
fortas
would
that
be
any
--
would
that
come
in
any
point
of
time
when
the
tribe
whether
it
could
cease
to
exist
for
purposes
of
the
ownership
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
right?
justice
abe
fortas
how
could
that
come
about?
justice
abe
fortas
so
long
as
there
were
two
indians
with
a
requisite
blood
characteristics
living
in
this
general
area,
the
tribe
would
continue
to
exist.
justice
abe
fortas
i
might
have
to
have
ten.
justice
abe
fortas
tell
me
again,
i've
forgotten.
is
all
of
the
former
reservation
land
now
in
private
ownership?
justice
abe
fortas
do
we
have
before
us
the
plan
that
the
indians
submitted
pursuant
to
the
termination
act?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
printed
in
any
of
these
documents
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
suppose
that
at
least
theoretically,
it's
possible
to
say
that
there
are
two
questions
presented
by
the
termination
act
and
the
plan,
one
is
whether
the
indians'
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
terminated,
cut
off.
the
other
is
whether
the
indians,
by
entering
into
the
treaty,
agreed
that
although
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
survive
in
a
certain
sense,
that
those
rights
would
then
support
the
subject
of
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
notice
--
i
notice
the
quote
there.
they're
brief
anyway.
it
sets
forth
the
provisions
in
both
the
termination
act
and
the
plans
submitted
by
the
indians
to
the
effect
that
the
laws
of
the
several
states
shall
apply
to
the
tribe
and
its
members
in
the
same
manner
as
they
apply
to
other
citizens
or
person
within
their
jurisdiction.
now,
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
it
was
intended
that
that
should
apply
to
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
as
well
as
in
other
respects.
would
that
satisfy
the
state
of
wisconsin?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
do
you
have
to
argue
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
cease
to
exist
in
all
respects
or
merely
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
had
to
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state
of
wisconsin?
justice
abe
fortas
this
would
mean
--
would
this
mean
that
if
for
example
there
were
an
alienation
of
the
property
by
the
indians,
the
indians
would
nevertheless
continue
to
reserve
the
right
of
access
or
right
to
hunt
and
fish
during
alienation
of
the
property
without
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
it
might
be
that
the
indians
won't
have
a
right
to
exclude
others
from
the
fishing
grounds
in
menominee
county,
whereas
if
the
indians
have
no
rights
or
whatever,
the
public
generally
might
have
access
to
them.
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
it
were
a
navigable
river
on
the
reservation.
i
don't
know,
on
the
former
reservation.
i
don't
know
if
it
is
or
not,
to
which
ordinarily,
if
it
weren't
indian
or
prior
indian
lands,
the
public
generally
would
have
access.
i
suppose
that
that
would
be
arguable
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
survived
as
the
property
of
the
tribe
to
the
extent
that
the
tribe
could
exclude
non-tribe
members
even
though
in
the
exercise
of
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
the
tribe
would
have
to
comply
with
the
conservation
regulations,
etcetera,
of
the
state.
justice
abe
fortas
so
non-indians
would
have
the
full
rights
to
--
to
hunt
and
fish
in
the
reservation,
former
reservation
as
they
would
in
any
other
part
to
the
--
of
the
state
of
wisconsin?
justice
abe
fortas
you
say
that
that
right
is
--
appertains
to
the
land.
to
the
tribal
land
--
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
so
that's
what
you
said
i
think.
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
if
the
corporation
sells
some
of
the
land,
an
individual
of
the
tribe
--
the
individual
member
of
the
tribe
can
no
longer
share
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
is
really
quite
a
different
idea
than
i
had
and
certainly
a
different
idea
that
i
got
from
mr.
hobbs'
argument
because
i
thought
you
were
talking
here
about
hunting
and
fishing
rights
that
belong
to
the
tribe
as
such
and
it
really
existed
independently
have
a
land
ownership
--
land
ownership
--
transfer
of
ownership
to
somebody
else
might
mean
that
somebody
else
had
a
right
also
to
hunt
and
fish
appertaining
to
the
land
with
it
somehow
whether
it
might
mean
as
practical
matter,
is
in
court
personality
not
the
corporation
but
the
in
court
personality
called
the
menominee
tribe
continue
to
have
hunting
and
fishing
rights
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
its
members,
landowners
or
not
landowners,
stockholders
or
not
stockholders.
justice
abe
fortas
that
sort
of
was
my
understanding
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
makes
three
of
us.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
--
you
are
substituting
the
corporation
for
the
tribe.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
that
--
you're
really
saying
that
the
corporation
owns
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
or
holds
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
as
appertaining
to
the
land
owned
by
the
corporation
and
holds
those
rights
for
the
benefit
of
what
the
members
of
the
persons
who
owns
stock
in
the
corporation
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
members
of
the
tribe
except
to
those
members
of
the
tribe
who
have
acquired
separate
ownership
in
there
--
in
some
lands.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
beg
your
pardon
then
because
i
thought
you
said
precisely
the
opposite.
i
thought
you
said
that
those
who
had
acquired
a
plot
of
land
from
the
corporation
by
turning
in
their
bonds
or
whatnot,
no
longer
have
a
right
to
hunt
and
fish
except
as
appertaining
to
that
separate
plot
of
land.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
claiborne
if
i
correctly
understand
your
position
and
i'm
sure
i
do,
you're
saying
that
so
far
as
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
concerned,
the
termination
act
had
no
effect
whatsoever
with
respect
to
the
indian
rights
except
to
the
extent
that
it
authorized
the
mechanism
which
might
be
used
to
transfer
some
lands
to
individual
ownership
under
the
extent
that
lands
transferred
to
individual
ownership,
they
cease
to
have
it
pertinent
to
them
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
that
on
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know
but
you're
saying
that
that
--
if
i
understand
you,
you're
saying
that
the
only
power
that
the
state
acquired
as
a
result
of
that
was
a
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
or
in
the
county,
the
former
reservation
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
is
there
any
precedent
for
that?
i
mean
to
say,
where
do
you
get
that?
is
that
just
a
rule
of
liability
that
you
deduce
ex
necessitate?
justice
abe
fortas
we
may
come
back
then.
i'm
just
talking
about
what
you
say
as
a
state
power.
i
don't
know
of
it.
maybe
it
exists.
the
state
power,
i
have
thought
that
a
state
had
power
so
far
as
the
reservation
is
concerned
and
either
have
power
or
didn't
have
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing.
in
a
reservation,
the
state
does
not
have
that
power,
can
we
agree
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
you
say
that
what
happened
here
is
that
reservation
lands
have
been
transferred
to
a
corporation
without
any
essential
change
in
their
character
status
so
far
as
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
concerned
except
the
power
of
alienation
and
its
instruments
and
to
accept
that,
somehow
or
rather
by
some
process
which
i'm
now
trying
to
find
out
from
you.
the
state
has
acquired
a
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
in
this
reservoir
reservation
lands
but
only
if
it
does
so
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
mr.
claiborne.
but
i
follow
your
up
to
point,
you
can
say
that
the
state
has
power
by
virtue
of
a,
b
and
c
that
happened
to
apply
its
hunting
and
fishing
rights
to
the
menominee
county,
the
reservoir
reservation.
now
that
--
i
follow
you
there
and
now
you're
adding
to
that
that
the
state
can
however
exercise
those
rights.
first,
you
said
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
but
now
you're
saying
only
to
the
extent
that
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
indians
which
are
not
the
same
concepts.
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
either
of
it.
i
don't
understand
where
you
get
them.
is
this
something
you're
asking
us
to
invent
right
now
for
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
we're
not
at
the
moment
interested
in
how
the
rights
should
be
caught
up
and
distributed,
we're
interested
in
the
problem
of
law
and
logic
and
it's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
and
whenever
anybody
owns
land,
it
is
subject
to
certain
powers
of
the
state.
one
of
those
powers
is
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing,
do
you
agree?
these
were
non-indians.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
are
you
saying
that
the
power
of
the
state
here
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
this
were
not
indians
--
as
if
these
were
not
indian
land
or
are
you
saying
that
there
is
something
extra
or
additional
that
the
indians
have
here
that
is
not
the
usual
or
ordinary
incident
of
land
ownership?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
that
something
extra
or
additional
you
say
as
a
right
to
have
the
state
refrain
from
applying
hunting
and
fishing
regulations
unless
those
hunting
and
fishing
regulations
are
either
for
the
benefit
for
the
indians
or
don't
interfere
with
indians'
enjoyment
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights
but
rather
to
the
concept
that
may
amount
close
to
zero.
justice
abe
fortas
everybody's
got
that
right
though,
mr.
claiborne.
the
question
is
and
this
is
--
i'll
put
it
to
you
and
i'm
going
to
leave
you
alone,
i
promise
you.
the
question
is
to
what
extent
can
the
state
of
wisconsin
apply
its
regulation
of
hunting
and
fishing
and
if
that
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
with
respect
to
these
lands,
differs
from
the
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
with
respect
to
non-indian
land,
in
what
way
does
it
differ
and
what's
the
logic
of
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
don't
agree.
do
you
or
do
you
not
agree
with
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
rights
that
provided
and
exercises
that
power
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians?
i
think
that's
correct
that's
stated
in
mr.
claiborne's
position
correctly.
if
that's
not
your
understanding,
please
let
me
know.
justice
abe
fortas
but
are
you
saying
that
the
regulation
could
be
imposed
and
administered
within
the
reservation
property?
justice
abe
fortas
--
provided
that
it
was
restricted
to
a
regulation
designed
to
protect
the
migratory
game.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we
may
have
to
consider
it
now
because
it's
involved
in
the
choice
of
theories
here
--
choice
of
--
and
the
principle
would
maybe
determined
in
this
case
as
to
what
is
--
what
is
the
power
of
the
state
here,
if
any.
justice
abe
fortas
then
your
positions
come
prior
to
mr.
claiborne.
it's
just
the
opposite
of
mr.
claiborne's.
the
state
has
power
to
regulate
hunting
on
the
reservation
to
the
extent
that
it
is
necessary
to
protect
the
non-indians.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
i
understand
your
position,
let's
see
if
i
do,
it
is
this,
that
if
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
i
mean
the
court
of
claims,
we
will
necessarily
be
deciding
that
the
tribes
still
has
hunting
and
fishing
rights
and
that
it
is
not
entitled
to
compensation
from
the
united
states,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
i
mean
to
say,
if
we
just
affirm
the
court
of
claims
and
confine
our
affirmance,
whatever
techniques
we
use
but
confine
our
affirmance
to
the
reasoning
stated
by
the
court
of
claims
in
that
effect
would
be
that
the
tribe
is
not
entitled
to
just
compensation
but
that
the
tribe
does
have
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
pretty
hard
to
reconcile
the
statutes,
isn't
it,
mr.
hobbs?
let
me
run
through
a
few
things
on
the
statute
if
you
don't
mind.
on
the
first
place,
i'm
looking
at
the
u.s.
code
which
is
used
here,
section
896
says
that
the
secretary
shall
accept
the
tribal
plan
as
you
have
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
effect,
they
shall
accept
the
tribal
plan
as
the
basis
for
the
conveyance
of
the
tribal
property,
for
the
conveyance
of
the
property
as
provided
by
the
tribal
plan
in
determining
this.
if
he'd
find
that
it
would
treat
with
reasonable
equity,
all
members
on
the
final
roll
of
the
tribe
are
prepared
as
of
june
17,
1954.
and
so
number
1,
we
have
all
of
the
tribal
property
conveyed
to
this
corporation,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
didn't
what
the
language
says.
is
there
some
qualification
elsewhere?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
second
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
all
--
now
that
says
that
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
transfer
to
the
tribal
property
the
title
of
all
property
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
that
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
particularization
of
896.
and
if
you
tell
me
that
this
is
wrong,
why
--
i
wouldn't
get
your
opinion
on
it.
they
say
is
that
construction
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
my
construction
of
this
just
casually
by
looking
at
it
here
is
number
1,
the
secretary
transfers
to
the
corporation
all
of
the
trust
property.
number
2,
that
the
plan
submitted
according
to
the
statute,
statute
contemplated
if
the
plans
submitted
would
contemplate
that
all
travel
property,
trust
property
or
not
would
be
placed
in
the
corporation.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
alright,
i
don't
think
we
got
a
meeting
of
the
minds
on
the
problem
here.
now
take
a
look
at
section
899,
because
i
don't
recall
being
commented
on
your
brief.
section
899
provides
that:
“thereafter,
that
is
say,
a
transfer
of
the
property
of
the
tribe.
the
individual
members
of
the
tribe
shall
not
be
entitled
to
services
performed
by
the
united
states
for
indians.”
and
you
look
further
down:
“all
statutes
of
the
united
states
which
shall
affect
indians
because
of
their
status
as
indians,
shall
no
longer
be
applicable
to
the
members
of
the
tribe”.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
contrary
to
argued
and
i
may
be
wrong
about
this,
contrary
to
what
you
argued
a
few
moments
ago,
that
statute
did
contemplate
that
upon
the
setting
up
of
this
corporation
transferred
to
it
of
the
tribal
property,
there
would
be
a
termination
of
the
status
of
the
menominees
as
indians
in
those
respects
that
are
peculiar
to
our
law
with
respect
to
indians.
now,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
the
real
question
is
--
are
for
purposes
of
the
problem
that
you
are
interested
in
here
is
whether
the
tribe
in
effect
survives
as
any
other
voluntary
organization
might
survive
or
whether
the
tribe
survives
with
the
special
and
peculiar
attributes
that
indian
tribes
have
under
our
laws
and
treaties
and
by
virtue
or
beyond
the
basic
and
underlying
relationship.
that's
the
question
it
seems
to
me
under
this
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
one
further
thing
here.
take
a
look
if
you
will
at
--
about
the
--
towards
the
end
of
section
896
as
following
the
language.
the
responsibility
of
the
united
states
to
furnish
all
such
supervision
and
services
to
the
tribe
and
the
members
thereof
because
of
their
status
as
indians
shall
cease
on
april
30,
1961.
the
plan
shall
contain
provision
for
protection
of
the
forest
on
a
sustained
yield
basis
and
for
the
protection
of
the
water,
soil,
fish
and
wildlife.
now,
that
would
indicate
the
plan
contained
provisions
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
the
corporation,
does
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
provision
would
--
contemplated
that
the
corporation
would
be
in
effect
a
custodian
of
whatever
rights
the
indians
might
have
in
the
forest
and
the
wildlife.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
bothers
me,
we're
handicapped
here
because
if
--
to
my
mind
or
expect
that
i
might
change
my
mind
on
further
study.
i
don't
think
these
questions
are
fully
briefed
in
terms
of
statute
and
that's
because
--
perhaps
because
of
a
peculiar
way
in
which
it
comes
up
here.
but
as
i
read
the
statute,
it's
arguable
at
least
that
there
was
an
intent
to
transfer
all
of
the
tribal
property,
including
the
forest,
whatever
--
rights
in
the
wildlife,
etcetera
to
this
corporation.
that
upon
such
transfer
and
pursuant
to
plan,
which
i
have
not
seen,
the
indians,
the
menominee
indians
seeks
to
have
any
benefits
from
their
status
as
indians
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
that
in
effect,
what
happened
here
is
a
--
whether
one
likes
it
or
not,
whether
one
considers
it
decent
or
indecent
and
why
in
effect
what
happened
here
was
a
transfer
of
tribal
ownership
and
responsibilities
from
the
tribal
hands
into
a
corporation
which
in
turn
was
owned
by
the
indians.
and
the
indians,
meaning
only
those
indians
whose
names
appeared
on
the
roll
as
of
june
17,
1954.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
roll
as
of
that
date?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
any
rights
in
the
corporate
property
that
other
--
that
their
children
might
have
would
be
rights
devolved
and
upon
their
children
as
a
result
of
a
stock
of
an
inheritance?
justice
abe
fortas
not
because
they're
indians?
not
because
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
menominee
indians
but
because
their
parents
own
a
stock.
this
plan
provides
for
--
is
the
plan
inhibits
the
indians
from
an
individual
indian
from
transferring
outside
of
the
tribe
his
ownership
interest
in
the
cooperation?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
what
happens
with
respect
to
hunting
and
fishing
rights?
90
--
year
1975
its
no
longer
very
far
away.
i
suppose
up
to
1975
the
tribe
doesn't
exercise
its
right
of
first
refusal,
the
state
of
wisconsin
does
not
but
some
stock
is
transferred
to
private
people.
and
who
has
these
rights
of
hunting
and
fishing
for
which
you
are
trying
to
vindicate
in
this
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
whether
you
have
to
decide
it
or
not
but
i
sure
have
to
think
it
through.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
hobbs,
i
call
your
attention
on
words
that
i
read
a
few
minutes
ago
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
tribe
owns
the
forest,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
tribe
own
--
has
a
wildlife
rights.
that
there
was
--
have
gone
to
the
corporation,
am
i
wrong
there,
you
disagree
there?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
show
me
something
in
the
statute
that
says
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
any
more
of
your
time.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
don't
really
want
to
say
that,
do
you?
i
can
understand
that
the
point
of
view
of
some
other
counsel,
not
yourself
that
the
claim
to
just
compensation
might
be
more
attractive
but
your
client,
the
tribe,
wants
you
to
insist
upon
the
--
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
claims
so
that
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights
can
be
vindicated.
justice
abe
fortas
and
they're
entitled
to
--
if
there's
anyway
that
you
can
work
it
out,
i'm
sure
you
wanted
to
try
to
work
it
out
so
that
this
court
considers
that
request
and
not
that
you
withdraw
it
here.
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
and
we
have
from
the
government
a
brief
that's
very
short
for
which
we're
all
unusually
very
grateful
at
this
time
but
in
this
particular
situation
i
think
what
we're
being
asked
to
do
is
to
consider
for
the
first
time
some
really
fundamental
problems
relating
to
the
startling
events
that
occurred
with
respect
to
the
indians
and
these
termination
acts.
consider
that
really
for
the
first
time
without
adversary
positions
being
expressed
here
on
the
basis
of
--
well
if
i
may
say
so
is,
a
presentation
in
the
written
material
that
doesn't
give
us
some
benefit
of
all
the
learning
then
i'm
sure
that
you
and
mr.
hobbs
have
on
these
subjects
and
primarily
the
analysis
of
this
statute.
and
you're
now
telling
us
that
in
your
view,
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
belong
to
the
tribes
and
still
belong
to
the
tribes,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
how
can
you
say
it
that
way
--
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
statute
expressly
says
that
the
tribal
roll
is
made
as
of
this
date
in
1954
and
thereafter
it
ceases.
it
can't
add
to
that.
they
became
citizens.
their
citizenship
is
protected
by
a
provision
in
this
statute
and
there
is
no
longer
anything
on
the
federal
law
they
call
the
tribal
roll
and
they
don't
have
rights
as
indians.
justice
abe
fortas
the
final
tribal
roll
but
these
same
indians
aren't
going
to
survive
forever
and
ever.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
claiborne,
do
you
know
whether
the
state
of
wisconsin
disagrees
with
you
on
both
of
those
and
points
and
if
so,
to
what
extent?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
does
the
state
of
wisconsin
take
the
position
that
the
indians
have
to
allow
other
people
to
come
on
the
former
reservation,
what
was
the
reservation
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
allow
them
to
fish
and
hunt?
justice
abe
fortas
but
do
you
take
the
position
that
this
area,
the
forest
land
are
owned
by
the
tribe
or
by
the
corporation
or
by
the
enrolled
indians
anyone
of
those
three
for
present
purposes,
you
take
the
position
that
they
have
an
ownership
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
if
--
that
then
the
right
to
exclude
others
would
--
there
is
not
--
something
that's
derived
from
the
state
that
says
indian,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
clairborne,
as
you
see
this,
does
the
state
of
wisconsin
have
any
regulatory
or
other
rights
with
respect
to
hunting
and
fishing
by
the
menominee
is
that
--
than
the
federal
government
had?
does
the
state
have
more
rights,
more
powers
than
the
federal
government
have?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
from
your
point
of
view
which
you
would
do
would
be
to
find
out
what
the
federal
rights
were
and
then
assume
that
those
or
some
of
them
were
transferred
to
the
state
but
the
fact
is
they
limit
of
what
is
transferred
to
the
state
and
from
--
in
that
way
you'd
get
some
indication
of
what
the
state
regulatory
powers
are.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
know
that,
mr.
claiborne,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
--
and
as
you
have
recognized
here
that
your
analysis
would
require
you
to
as
--
in
ascertaining
what
the
powers
of
the
wisconsin
act
to
start
with
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
otherwise,
the
federal
government
is
given
the
states
something
that
the
federal
government
did
not
have.
and
if
that
is
effective,
then
there
has
been
a
taking,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
as
mr.
justice
black
was
suggesting,
there
was
a
--
as
i
remember
it,
a
very
strong
philosophy
here
to
the
effect
that
the
indian
separate
property
and
the
tribal
property
in
effect
ought
to
be
disestablished
and
that
there
ought
to
be
a
mechanism
for
the
gradual
liquidation
of
tribal
property
as
an
enclave
in
the
general
economic
system.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
are
either
in
exactly
the
same
posture,
exactly
the
reverse
posture,
is
that
right
and
rather
that
either
way
on
conventional
legal
reasoning.
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
--
this
is
an
important
step
in
your
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
forgive
me
--
forgive
me
but
to
get
back
to
the
ownership
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
is
it
your
argument
that
those
were
owned
by
the
tribe
--
total
title
is
in
the
tribe
or
that
those
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
owned
by
the
members
of
the
tribe?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
argument
is
that
the
menominee
termination
in
fact
did
not
terminate
the
existence
of
the
tribe.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
merely
terminated
the
federal
supervision
of
the
tribe.
justice
abe
fortas
of
the
tribe's
sovereign
powers.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
the
tribes
continued
has
some
kind
of
an
entity,
legal,
mystical
or
otherwise
for
purposes
of
continued
ownership
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
it
could
be
a
serious
question
when
that
is
to
whether
the
indians
could
transfer
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights
an
unincorporated
association
without
destroying
them.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
your
position
is
that
the
membership
corporation
is
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
ownership
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
right.
justice
abe
fortas
would
that
be
any
--
would
that
come
in
any
point
of
time
when
the
tribe
whether
it
could
cease
to
exist
for
purposes
of
the
ownership
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
right?
justice
abe
fortas
how
could
that
come
about?
justice
abe
fortas
so
long
as
there
were
two
indians
with
a
requisite
blood
characteristics
living
in
this
general
area,
the
tribe
would
continue
to
exist.
justice
abe
fortas
i
might
have
to
have
ten.
justice
abe
fortas
tell
me
again,
i've
forgotten.
is
all
of
the
former
reservation
land
now
in
private
ownership?
justice
abe
fortas
do
we
have
before
us
the
plan
that
the
indians
submitted
pursuant
to
the
termination
act?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
printed
in
any
of
these
documents
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
suppose
that
at
least
theoretically,
it's
possible
to
say
that
there
are
two
questions
presented
by
the
termination
act
and
the
plan,
one
is
whether
the
indians'
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
terminated,
cut
off.
the
other
is
whether
the
indians,
by
entering
into
the
treaty,
agreed
that
although
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
survive
in
a
certain
sense,
that
those
rights
would
then
support
the
subject
of
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
notice
--
i
notice
the
quote
there.
they're
brief
anyway.
it
sets
forth
the
provisions
in
both
the
termination
act
and
the
plans
submitted
by
the
indians
to
the
effect
that
the
laws
of
the
several
states
shall
apply
to
the
tribe
and
its
members
in
the
same
manner
as
they
apply
to
other
citizens
or
person
within
their
jurisdiction.
now,
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
it
was
intended
that
that
should
apply
to
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
as
well
as
in
other
respects.
would
that
satisfy
the
state
of
wisconsin?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
do
you
have
to
argue
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
cease
to
exist
in
all
respects
or
merely
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
had
to
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state
of
wisconsin?
justice
abe
fortas
this
would
mean
--
would
this
mean
that
if
for
example
there
were
an
alienation
of
the
property
by
the
indians,
the
indians
would
nevertheless
continue
to
reserve
the
right
of
access
or
right
to
hunt
and
fish
during
alienation
of
the
property
without
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
it
might
be
that
the
indians
won't
have
a
right
to
exclude
others
from
the
fishing
grounds
in
menominee
county,
whereas
if
the
indians
have
no
rights
or
whatever,
the
public
generally
might
have
access
to
them.
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
it
were
a
navigable
river
on
the
reservation.
i
don't
know,
on
the
former
reservation.
i
don't
know
if
it
is
or
not,
to
which
ordinarily,
if
it
weren't
indian
or
prior
indian
lands,
the
public
generally
would
have
access.
i
suppose
that
that
would
be
arguable
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
survived
as
the
property
of
the
tribe
to
the
extent
that
the
tribe
could
exclude
non-tribe
members
even
though
in
the
exercise
of
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
the
tribe
would
have
to
comply
with
the
conservation
regulations,
etcetera,
of
the
state.
justice
abe
fortas
so
non-indians
would
have
the
full
rights
to
--
to
hunt
and
fish
in
the
reservation,
former
reservation
as
they
would
in
any
other
part
to
the
--
of
the
state
of
wisconsin?
justice
abe
fortas
you
say
that
that
right
is
--
appertains
to
the
land.
to
the
tribal
land
--
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
so
that's
what
you
said
i
think.
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
if
the
corporation
sells
some
of
the
land,
an
individual
of
the
tribe
--
the
individual
member
of
the
tribe
can
no
longer
share
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
is
really
quite
a
different
idea
than
i
had
and
certainly
a
different
idea
that
i
got
from
mr.
hobbs'
argument
because
i
thought
you
were
talking
here
about
hunting
and
fishing
rights
that
belong
to
the
tribe
as
such
and
it
really
existed
independently
have
a
land
ownership
--
land
ownership
--
transfer
of
ownership
to
somebody
else
might
mean
that
somebody
else
had
a
right
also
to
hunt
and
fish
appertaining
to
the
land
with
it
somehow
whether
it
might
mean
as
practical
matter,
is
in
court
personality
not
the
corporation
but
the
in
court
personality
called
the
menominee
tribe
continue
to
have
hunting
and
fishing
rights
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
its
members,
landowners
or
not
landowners,
stockholders
or
not
stockholders.
justice
abe
fortas
that
sort
of
was
my
understanding
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
makes
three
of
us.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
--
you
are
substituting
the
corporation
for
the
tribe.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
that
--
you're
really
saying
that
the
corporation
owns
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
or
holds
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
as
appertaining
to
the
land
owned
by
the
corporation
and
holds
those
rights
for
the
benefit
of
what
the
members
of
the
persons
who
owns
stock
in
the
corporation
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
members
of
the
tribe
except
to
those
members
of
the
tribe
who
have
acquired
separate
ownership
in
there
--
in
some
lands.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
beg
your
pardon
then
because
i
thought
you
said
precisely
the
opposite.
i
thought
you
said
that
those
who
had
acquired
a
plot
of
land
from
the
corporation
by
turning
in
their
bonds
or
whatnot,
no
longer
have
a
right
to
hunt
and
fish
except
as
appertaining
to
that
separate
plot
of
land.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
claiborne
if
i
correctly
understand
your
position
and
i'm
sure
i
do,
you're
saying
that
so
far
as
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
concerned,
the
termination
act
had
no
effect
whatsoever
with
respect
to
the
indian
rights
except
to
the
extent
that
it
authorized
the
mechanism
which
might
be
used
to
transfer
some
lands
to
individual
ownership
under
the
extent
that
lands
transferred
to
individual
ownership,
they
cease
to
have
it
pertinent
to
them
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
that
on
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know
but
you're
saying
that
that
--
if
i
understand
you,
you're
saying
that
the
only
power
that
the
state
acquired
as
a
result
of
that
was
a
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
or
in
the
county,
the
former
reservation
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
is
there
any
precedent
for
that?
i
mean
to
say,
where
do
you
get
that?
is
that
just
a
rule
of
liability
that
you
deduce
ex
necessitate?
justice
abe
fortas
we
may
come
back
then.
i'm
just
talking
about
what
you
say
as
a
state
power.
i
don't
know
of
it.
maybe
it
exists.
the
state
power,
i
have
thought
that
a
state
had
power
so
far
as
the
reservation
is
concerned
and
either
have
power
or
didn't
have
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing.
in
a
reservation,
the
state
does
not
have
that
power,
can
we
agree
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
you
say
that
what
happened
here
is
that
reservation
lands
have
been
transferred
to
a
corporation
without
any
essential
change
in
their
character
status
so
far
as
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
concerned
except
the
power
of
alienation
and
its
instruments
and
to
accept
that,
somehow
or
rather
by
some
process
which
i'm
now
trying
to
find
out
from
you.
the
state
has
acquired
a
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
in
this
reservoir
reservation
lands
but
only
if
it
does
so
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
mr.
claiborne.
but
i
follow
your
up
to
point,
you
can
say
that
the
state
has
power
by
virtue
of
a,
b
and
c
that
happened
to
apply
its
hunting
and
fishing
rights
to
the
menominee
county,
the
reservoir
reservation.
now
that
--
i
follow
you
there
and
now
you're
adding
to
that
that
the
state
can
however
exercise
those
rights.
first,
you
said
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
but
now
you're
saying
only
to
the
extent
that
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
indians
which
are
not
the
same
concepts.
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
either
of
it.
i
don't
understand
where
you
get
them.
is
this
something
you're
asking
us
to
invent
right
now
for
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
we're
not
at
the
moment
interested
in
how
the
rights
should
be
caught
up
and
distributed,
we're
interested
in
the
problem
of
law
and
logic
and
it's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
and
whenever
anybody
owns
land,
it
is
subject
to
certain
powers
of
the
state.
one
of
those
powers
is
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing,
do
you
agree?
these
were
non-indians.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
are
you
saying
that
the
power
of
the
state
here
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
this
were
not
indians
--
as
if
these
were
not
indian
land
or
are
you
saying
that
there
is
something
extra
or
additional
that
the
indians
have
here
that
is
not
the
usual
or
ordinary
incident
of
land
ownership?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
that
something
extra
or
additional
you
say
as
a
right
to
have
the
state
refrain
from
applying
hunting
and
fishing
regulations
unless
those
hunting
and
fishing
regulations
are
either
for
the
benefit
for
the
indians
or
don't
interfere
with
indians'
enjoyment
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights
but
rather
to
the
concept
that
may
amount
close
to
zero.
justice
abe
fortas
everybody's
got
that
right
though,
mr.
claiborne.
the
question
is
and
this
is
--
i'll
put
it
to
you
and
i'm
going
to
leave
you
alone,
i
promise
you.
the
question
is
to
what
extent
can
the
state
of
wisconsin
apply
its
regulation
of
hunting
and
fishing
and
if
that
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
with
respect
to
these
lands,
differs
from
the
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
with
respect
to
non-indian
land,
in
what
way
does
it
differ
and
what's
the
logic
of
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
don't
agree.
do
you
or
do
you
not
agree
with
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
rights
that
provided
and
exercises
that
power
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians?
i
think
that's
correct
that's
stated
in
mr.
claiborne's
position
correctly.
if
that's
not
your
understanding,
please
let
me
know.
justice
abe
fortas
but
are
you
saying
that
the
regulation
could
be
imposed
and
administered
within
the
reservation
property?
justice
abe
fortas
--
provided
that
it
was
restricted
to
a
regulation
designed
to
protect
the
migratory
game.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we
may
have
to
consider
it
now
because
it's
involved
in
the
choice
of
theories
here
--
choice
of
--
and
the
principle
would
maybe
determined
in
this
case
as
to
what
is
--
what
is
the
power
of
the
state
here,
if
any.
justice
abe
fortas
then
your
positions
come
prior
to
mr.
claiborne.
it's
just
the
opposite
of
mr.
claiborne's.
the
state
has
power
to
regulate
hunting
on
the
reservation
to
the
extent
that
it
is
necessary
to
protect
the
non-indians.
