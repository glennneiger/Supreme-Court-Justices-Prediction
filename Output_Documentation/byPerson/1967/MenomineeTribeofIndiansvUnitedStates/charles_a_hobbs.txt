mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
menominee
indians
live
in
eastern
wisconsin
near
green
bay.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
am
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
am
not
informed,
mr.
chief
justice,
exactly
to
what
extent
if
any
the
state
waives
its
regulations,
my
understanding
is
its
general
enforcement.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
state
does
claim
the
right
to
impose
all
of
its
rules,
including
license
fees
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
on
the
indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
these
indians
have
always
hunted
and
fished
for
subsistence
and
many
of
them
still
do
today.
in
1854,
they
made
a
treaty
with
the
united
states,
giving
up
the
last
of
their
lands
to
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
settling
them
up
with
the
white
settlers.
in
return,
they
received
their
reservation
which,
as
we
shall
see,
gave
them
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
on
that
reservation
according
to
their
customs
without
interference
from
state
or
federal
authorities.
until
1961
no
one
questioned
this
right
to
hunt
and
fish
and
the
indians
peacefully
continued
to
exercise
it.
but
then
congress
in
the
menominee
termination
act
made
the
menominee
reservation
subject
to
state
laws
in
general
without
saying
anything
about
exempting
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish.
the
state
figured
that
that
meant
that
the
right
had
been
extinguished
and
the
game
warden
came
on
the
reservation
and
begun
making
arrests.
this
case
started
in
1962
when
three
menominee
indians
were
arrested
by
the
state
authorities
for
shining
deer,
that
is
hunting
with
the
aid
of
an
artificial
light
and
for
transporting
a
loaded
and
uncased
gun
in
an
automobile.
in
case
you
wonder,
“shining
dear”
means,
you
go
out
on
the
woods
with
the
flashlight
or
an
automobile
headlight
and
when
a
deer
comes
along
and
sees
the
light,
he
looks
at
it
and
freezes.
his
eyes
glow
in
the
dark
and
it
makes
it
perfect
target;
it
makes
it
very
easy
to
shoot
the
dear
and
that's
why
it's
against
the
rule.
it's
unsportsmanlike.
that's
also
the
reason
for
the
rule
against
carrying
an
unloaded
and
uncased
gun
or
a
loaded
and
uncased
gun
in
an
automobile.
it
is
primarily
against
the
law
to
shoot
game
from
an
automobile
and
this
rule
carrying
a
loaded
and
uncased
game
in
an
automobile
is
an
aid
of
the
basic
rule
against
shooting
game
from
an
automobile.
these
are
sportsmanlike
rules
that
happened
to
be
involved
here.
a
law,
of
course,
the
case
does
involve
all
of
the
rules
of
wisconsin
that
apply
to
hunting
and
fishing
of
which
there
are
three
main
purposes:
conservation
is
one;
sportsmanship
is
another;
and
possibly,
though
i
don't
think
so,
safety
might
be
a
third
purpose
for
some
of
these
rules.
while
i'm
on
this
point,
let
me
point
out
some
of
the
other
rules
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
and
would
apply
against
these
indians
subject
to
possible
local
waiver
which
i'm
not
aware
of
it
if
there
is
any.
hunting
licenses
are
required
and
they
cost
from
$2
to
$10
depending
on
the
type
of
hunting
license
that
they
are.
certain
species
can
never
be
shot.
for
example,
quail,
for
example,
elk
and
moose.
if
the
indians
are
subject
to
these
rules,
they
can
never
shoot
moose
or
quail.
there
are
bag
limits
in
seasons.
for
example,
in
the
area
covered
by
this
reservation,
the
bag
limit
for
deer
is
one
deer
per
season
and
the
season
last
for
ten
days
from
november
23rd
to
december
1.
the
brief
inadvertently
said
one
deer
per
day.
if
the
just
--
any
of
the
justices
noted
that,
it's
an
error
for
which
i
apologize.
the
correct
rule
is
one
deer
per
season;
that
is
one
deer
per
year.
there
are
also
the
sporting
rules
about
how
game
may
be
shot:
you
can't
shoot
a
swimming
deer
or
swimming
bear;
you
can't
hunt
with
the
aid
of
an
airplane;
you
can't
shine
deer,
which
has
what
brought
us
to
this
case.
back
to
our
prosecution,
in
the
menominee
--
shawano,
menominee
county
court,
the
indians
admitted
that
they
had
done
what
was
charged
but
they
claimed
the
--
that
the
1854
treaty
gave
them
an
immunity
from
the
prosecution.
judge
fisher
agreed
with
them
and
he
wrote
a
long
opinion
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix,
acquitting
them.
the
state
appealed
under
state
law
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
that
court
by
a
two-to-one
decision
reversed.
they
held
that
the
indians
had
the
hunting
right
under
the
1854
treaty
alright
but
that
that
right
had
been
extinguished
by
the
menominee
termination
act.
the
indians
sought
certiorari
from
this
court
which
was
denied.
that
appeared
to
settle
the
matter
and
so
the
tribe
then
filed
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
seeking
damages
for
the
loss
of
these
valuable
rights.
the
court
of
claims
dismissed
the
claim
on
the
ground
that
the
tribe
still
own
the
right.
now
the
tribe
was
very
pleased
at
this
rationale
because
they
would
much
rather
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
than
they
would
any
compensation
likely
to
be
awarded.
so
although
technically
we
lost
the
law,
we
did
so
for
a
reason
of
which
we
very
much
approved
and
hope
that
this
court
will
affirm.
on
the
basis
of
the
conflict
between
the
court
of
claims
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
this
court
granted
certiorari.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
is
correct.
the
first
time
we
sought
certiorari
from
this
court,
the
government's
position,
although
qualified,
but
basically
was
that
we
no
longer
had
the
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
arguing
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
the
real
opponent
here.
there's
no
question
about
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
are
not
here
except
as
amicus.
they
have
filed
a
brief
and
a
supplemental
memorandum
presenting
their
position
and
therefore,
their
position
is
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
what
i
call
a
supplemental
memorandum,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
your
honor,
i
feel
that
the
state
has
--
actually,
as
a
practical
matter,
presented
its
position
in
its
amicus
brief
which
it
wrote
as
a
brief
on
the
merits
and
in
its
supplemental
memorandum
which
adds
to
explain
the
brief.
the
state
was
on
notice
that
this
case
was
coming
up
here.
the
state
knew
that
its
interest
could
very
well
be
affected
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
court
of
--
the
government
had
moved
to
dismiss
our
case
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
government
took
the
position
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
compensation
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
of
course,
it
was
not
but
you're
asking
when
the
government
first
took
that
position.
there's
not
very
much.
we
--
the
indians
can
do
about
that.
we
can
only
make
sure
the
state
knows
what's
going
on
which
it
did
and
leave
it
to
them
to
take
what
action
seems
in
their
best
interest.
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
correct.
united
states
basic
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
wouldn't
you
regard
that
the
state
has
decided
that
its
interests
are
adequately
protected
by
its
briefs?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
the
state
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
the
state
had
filed
a
motion
for
--
leave
to
intervene
or
for
time
to
argue
which
seems
or
rather
simple
and
obvious
course
perhaps,
that
would
have
been
seriously
considered
by
this
court.
at
least
does
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
certainly
issued
here
the
case.
it's
up
here
regularly
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
claims
between
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
there
is
to
the
extent
that
the
state
has
made
its
position
known
in
the
materials
that
it's
filed
here.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
there's
none.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
in
minor
detail,
there
is
of
course,
the
extent
of
the
right
for
example.
well,
is
the
difference
between
you
and
the
solicitor
general
only
a
minor
difference?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
government
does
say
that
these
particular
regulations
involved
in
this
case,
that
is
shining
dear
and
carrying
a
loaded
gun
in
a
car,
they
say
these
regulations
are
upholdable
on
the
basis
of
safety
in
conservation
that
is
necessary
for
conservation.
of
course,
we
disagree
with
that.
but
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
i
admit
it's
a
big
difference
and
critical
for
this
very
case.
but
the
scope
of
this
case
of
course
is
broader.
but
yes
indeed,
that
brings
to
you
an
adversary
question
to
be
decided.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
state
of
wisconsin
does
and
it
is
an
amicus
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
strictly,
no.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
affirm
the
court
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
we
both
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
want
you
to
affirm
the
court
of
claims.
you'll
notice
that
too
that
we
have
an
alternative
ultimate
position,
which
is
clearly
adversary,
and
that
is
that
if
we
are
wrong
and
do
not
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
today,
then
we
are
entitled
to
compensation
for
it.
and
therefore
the
court
of
claims
is
our
alternative
and
lest
preferred
position
nevertheless
we've
made
it
in
the
brief
and
it's
there,
we
mean
it.
if
we're
wrong
and
don't
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
then
we
want
compensation
and
we
want
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
they
would
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
in
their
brief
they
made
several
statements
which
led
me
to
think
that
possibly
they
do
see
something
to
our
argument
for
compensation.
but
in
the
court
of
claims,
there
was
a
direct
argument
that
we
we're
not
entitled
any
compensation
even
if
we
had
the
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
that's
the
present
position,
your
honor.
yes,
that's
accurate.
they
say
that
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
government
could
regulate
these
rights
prior
to
termination,
the
state
now
has
that
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
without
binding
the
client
who
should
be
consulted
on
something
like
that,
it's
my
own
impression
that
the
government
is
correct
in
that
and
if
there
was
no
change
in
the
scope
of
regulability
of
--
by
the
sovereign
that
which
the
federal
government
had
did
transfer
to
the
state
without
giving
rise
to
a
right
of
compensation
on
our
part.
i
--
my
impression
is
that
the
government
is
correct
in
that
theory.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
if
you
were
to
affirm
per
curiam
without
opinion,
we
will
be
faced
with
an
extensive
additional
litigation
and
this
case
has
been
litigated
since
1962
and
the
tribe
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
under
the
strictest
possible
view
of
judicial
review,
that's
correct.
you
could
affirm
the
court
of
claims
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
yes,
it
would
have
--
it
would
require
further
litigation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
the
decision
of
the
court
did
not
settle
what
is
really
at
issue
here,
which
is,
do
we
still
have
the
rights.
an
affirmance
however
bare
of
the
court
of
claims
would
require
that
the
trial
be
further
litigated.
they
couldn't
let
it
sit
there.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
the
tribe
is
overwhelmingly
interested
in
having
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
they're
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
conflict
that
has
arisen
between
the
court
of
claims
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
can
only
be
decided
here.
there
is
no
alternative.
if
you
can't
decide
it
at
this
time,
the
case
is
before
you,
they
will
come
up
again.
hopefully,
under
such
circumstances
that
certiorari
will
again
be
granted
but
the
state
of
wisconsin
can
certainly
be
expected
to
adhere
to
its
present
position,
which
is
that
we
do
not
have
the
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
would
take
the
opinion
as
meaning
that,
whether
it
said
so
or
not.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
and
we
would
be
--and
then
what
would
remain
would
be
the
definition
of
what
if
any
supervisory
or
regulatory
power
the
state
has
under
the
termination
act,
is
that
correct?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
it
might
further
be
opened
possibly.
i
don't
think
the
state
would
exercise
it
but
technically,
the
state
could
take
the
position
that
it
was
not
bound
by
such
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
since
they
weren't
a
party
and
they
would
have
a
right
to
continue
litigate
until
it
was
a
party.
i
suppose
that's
a
possibility
but
i'm
quite
certain
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
wouldn't
attempt
to
do
such
a
futile
thing.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
not
technically,
mr.
chief
justice
in
so
many
words
but
as
the
practical
effect
of
what
it
has
done
is
to
attempt
to
become
a
party
for
the
purpose
of
filing
its
brief,
it
has
acted
as
a
party.
it
didn't
ask
to
become
one,
no.
i
shall
proceed
if
that
is
the
desire
of
the
justices
with
the
further
argument
on
the
merits.
we
have,
of
course,
homed
in
on
the
peculiar
posture
of
the
case
and
that
is
that
both
the
government
and
we
seek
affirmance
of
the
court
of
claims.
i
would
like
to
give
you
a
little
background
on
the
menominees.
i
don't
know
if
you've
ever
heard
of
them.
they've
been
one
of
the
friendly
tribes
of
america
and
therefore
the
united
states
never
paid
much
attention
to
them
except
on
one
of
their
lands
and
negotiated
sessions
with
them.
there
are
about
3200
members
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
3200.
that
was
as
of
1954.
there
had
been
some
births
and
deaths
since
but
that's
substantially
correct.
they
live
in
the
lake
and
forest
country
of
wisconsin.
their
reservation
is
substantially
a
forest
and
it
occurs
in
the
--
the
whole
area
used
to
be
forest
but
the
area
outside
the
reservation
has
all
been
cut
over
so
that
in
a
sense,
the
reservation
is
like
an
island
of
forest
in
a
surrounding
farmland.
i
don't
mean
to
imply
a
kansas
perry
but
the
farmlands
may
have
tree
stands
here
and
there
but
the
reservation
is
solid
and
it's
prominent
as
you
approach
it
from
a
distance.
they
used
to
hunt
of
course.
they
rely
almost
exclusively
on
hunting
and
fishing
for
their
livelihood.
nowadays,
like
the
rest
of
us,
they
buy
their
food
enclosed
at
the
store.
but
all
--
practically
all
the
male
menominees
still
hunt
and
fish
as
often
as
they
can
get
away
to
do
so.
they
--
and
they
eat
what
they
catch.
it's
a
very
important
activity
to
them
and
as
--
at
least
one
anthropologist
has
noted
hunting
and
fishing
to
indians
seems
to
have
some
symbolic
significance
to
them.
some
--
it
connects
them
to
their
indian
heritage
and
has
almost
a
quasi-religious
meaning
to
the
indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
there
is
no
commercial
activity.
they
may
trade
among
one
another
or
perhaps
a
person
may
eat
part
of
a
deer
and
sell
the
rest
to
a
friend
or
give
it
away
with
their
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
pardon?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
there's
no
commercial
in
the
course
of
any
significance
or
else
i
would
have
heard
of
it.
i'm
not
saying
that
there's
never
any
selling
but
i
don't
know
and
i've
never
heard
of
it
and
i
think
i
would
have.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
correct.
the
tribe
does
not
seek
commercial
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oh,
no!
no,
that's
a
--
that's
one
of
the
implementing
details
in
event
of
an
affirmance.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
think
i
can
answer
it
to
your
satisfaction.
that
rule
was
created
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
the
property
of
the
menominees
under
the
menominee
termination
act.
that
was
the
only
purpose
of
that
roll
was
to
define
the
membership
of
the
tribe
for
the
purpose
of
distribution
of
the
ownership
of
this
forest.
the
roll
was
closed
meaning,
no
newborns
would
get
on
it.
its
--
it
didn't
mean
that
that
was
the
end
of
the
roll.
the
roll
is
still
in
existence
today.
and
as
congress
specified,
only
the
people
named
on
that
roll
are
entitled
to
this
forest,
the
ownership
of
the
menominee
forest,
if
and
when
it's
ever
distributed
or
converted
into
some
sort
of
property
for
them.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
the
menom
--
basically
the
menominee
tribe
subject
to
the
restraint
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
a
good
question.
it
so
happens
right
now
there
is
no
active
formal
organization
of
the
tribe;
therefore,
it
uses
the
corporation
as
its
governing
structure.
but
the
corporation
is
basically
a
business
venture
and
is
in
fact
is
run
by
a
number
of
outsiders
on
the
board
of
directors.
the
--
if
there
--
whenever
a
need
arose,
the
menominees
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
non-indians.
the
board
of
directors
comprises
seven
directors,
as
i
recall,
4
of
whom
are
indians
and
3
are
non-indians.
that's
to
get
expertise
into
the
operation
of
this
corporation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oh,
to
lumber,
to
log
the
woods
and
cut
lumber.
the
menominee
mill,
that's
--
i
didn't
think
to
say
it,
that's
all
they
have.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
it's
not
a
personal
thing;
this
belongs
to
the
tribe.
the
menominee
tribe
was
never
extinguished.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
forest
belongs
to
the
corporation.
the
only
property
transfer,
it
was
property
held
in
trust
by
the
unites
states
your
honor.
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
we
say
are
not
such
a
property.
those
were
property
rights
of
the
unions
not
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
and
did
not
get
transferred
to
the
corporation.
we
say,
our
conceptualization
of
this
is
this:
the
menominee
tribe
is
a
group
of
indians,
which
has
in
effect
a
membership
corporation
under
the
wis
--
laws
of
wisconsin.
however,
that
corporation
does
not
operate
actively
because
there's
no
business
for
it
to
transact.
the
menominees
do
meet
informally
outside
the
structure
of
the
corporation
but
rarely.
the
corporation,
because
the
mill
is
the
business
of
the
menominees,
the
corporation
performs
all
that
business.
as
--
the
casual
observer
might
think
there's
one
entity
here
but
in
reality
there
are
two:
there's
the
visible
corporation
and
there's
the
inactive
and
at
present
invisible
tribal
organization.
now,
the
tribal
organization
consists
of
the
people
on
that
closed
roll
plus
their
descendants
and
they
would
be
the
ones
to
determine
who
are
their
--
who
are
the
proper
members
of
the
menominee
tribe.
that's
standard
rules
for
indians.
basically,
the
indian
tribe
itself
determines
who
shall
be
a
member
of
its
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
think
not.
i
think
just
tribal
trust
property.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
look
at
section
897,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
would
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
my
view
would
be
that
non-trust
property
would
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
tribe
as
it
always
was.
it
never
was
in
the
hands
of
the
united
states
to
convey.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
absolutely
disagree
with
it.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
appearing
in
section
891
states
what
we
think
is
the
correct
view
of
what
happened
here.
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
provide
for
the
orderly
termination
not
of
the
property
and
members
of
the
tribe
but
a
federal
supervision
over
the
property
and
members
of
the
tribe.
that's
what's
been
terminated.
the
federal
benefits,
the
federal
agent
on
the
reservation
that
tells
them
what
to
do,
the
federal
trusteeship
of
the
property
where
the
money
is
in
the
bank
and
the
timber
cannot
be
cut
without
the
government's
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
obviously,
all
federal
statutes
are
--
which
had
been
applicable
to
these
menominees
because
they
were
menominees
are
no
longer
applicable
obviously.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
but
this
statute
did
not
wipe
out
their
treaty
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
some
of
them,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
suppose
--
our
position
of
course
is
that
the
corporation
acquired
only
the
trust
to
property.
but
suppose
the
corporation
acquired
all
their
rights,
including
the
hunting
rights,
the
indian
property
is
communally
owned
and
for
the
corporation
to
own
these
rights
for
the
exercise
of
its
members
would
not
be
anomalous,
would
it?
i'm
not
quite
sure,
i
understand
your
--
the
purpose
here
of
your
question
about
the
plan.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
the
corporation
--
whatever
the
corporation
own,
i
would
agree,
is
owned
through
stock
ownership
by
the
individual
people
on
that
roll
and
no
others,
not
their
descendants.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
without
addition.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
may
i
consult
with
counsel?
the
stock
was
made
inalienable
for
20
years
and
thereafter
the
corporation
has
a
right
of
first
refusal
to
buy
the
stock
if
it
should
ever
be
put
up
for
sale
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
a
second
right
of
refusal
in
said
event.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
this
corporation
is
a
stock
corporation
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
for
a
profit
but
there
is
also
secondly,
a
membership
corporation
which
is
not
active.
it
exists
but
is
not
active.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
i
have
to
decide
that
i
suppose
i
would
say
that
the
right
is
personal
to
the
menominees.
you
see
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
the
--
as
we
argue
the
tribe
of
indians
was
not
abolished
and
if
they
own
the
right,
then
obviously,
it's
owned
only
by
the
members
of
the
tribe.
it
cannot
be
alienated
to
non-indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
forest
did
go
to
the
corporation.
the
corporation
would
not
have
title
to
wildlife
but
the
rights
to
take
that
wildlife
stayed
with
the
tribe.
that's
our
position.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
did
refer
you
to
897
which
said
that
“trust
property”,
i
mean,
it
indicates
to
us
that
only
trust
property
was
transferred
to
the
corporation.
the
united
states
only
transferred
that
property
which
it
held
for
the
tribe
to
the
corporation.
that
property
which
it
did
not
hold
for
the
tribe
which
the
tribe
own
in
its
own
right
without
being
subject
to
trusteeship,
the
tribe
still
owns.
it's
our
position.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
take
the
position
that
before
termination,
the
united
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
say
they
had
some
power
to
prevent
their
abuse
under
their
roll
as
trustee.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
possibly
or
there
may
possibly
be
an
alternative
position
which
was
that
although
there
--
although
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
not
specific
trust
property.
nevertheless,
the
united
states,
as
its
roll
as
general
guardian
of
the
indians,
would
have
the
power
something
different
than
a
trust
title.
we
have
the
power
to
govern
the
menominee's
exercise
of
that
right.
but
if
i'm
wrong
there
then
we
simply
disagree
with
the
government
that
they
had
that
trustee's
power.
another
source
claimed
by
the
government,
they
say
that
the
sovereign,
the
federal
government
before
termination
and
the
state
government
after
termination
would
have
the
same
right
to
regulate
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
as
the
indian's
rights
which
are
off--reservation.
its
--
there's
a
fairly
well
litigated
area
involving
indian
off-reservations
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
and
this
court
held
that
those
off-reservations,
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
can
be
regulated
by
the
state
“where
necessary”
to
achieve
conservation.
and,
under
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
had
construed
that
to
mean
that
in
effect
the
indians
are
subject
to
regulation
to
prevent
them
from
totally
destroying
a
particular
game
resource
which
has
to
be
shared
with
the
non-indians
off
the
reservation.
the
government
says
that
qualified
right
--
a
regulation
was
in
the
federal
government
before
termination
and
is
now
in
the
state
government
after
termination.
we
take
the
position
that
to
the
extent
that
the
fishing
game
on
the
menominee's
reservation
migrated
off
the
reservation.
if
the
migratory
zone
included
in
area
off
the
reservation,
we
would
concede
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
now
has
the
--
the
federal
government
before
termination
and
state
of
wisconsin
now
has
the
power,
without
any
right
of
compensation
in
us
to
do
what
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
menominees
from
destroying
that
resource
because
that
resource
must
be
shared
with
non-indians.
on
the
other
hand,
as
to
a
game
or
fish
resource
which
stays
entirely
on
the
reservation
which
i
think
might
apply
to
squirrels
or
groundhogs,
animals
that
don't
migrate,
we
take
the
position
that
the
federal
government
had
no
power
of
regulation
prior
to
termination
and
that
the
state
has
none
now.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
does
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
your
honor
we
merely
ask
this
court
to
review
the
final
judgment.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
do.
well,
we
do
now
as
an
alternate
position.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
only
if
we
lose
on
our
primary
point
which
is
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
sure
am.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
basically,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
we
do
not.
we
asked
for
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
we
asked
for
review.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
and
it
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
asked
for
review
of
the
dilemma
that
we've
been
put
into.
we
have
got
--
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
saying
we
don't
have
the
rights.
they'll
put
us
in
jail
if
we
exercise
them.
we
have
the
court
of
claims
saying
we
do
have
the
rights
and
therefore
we
can't
be
paid
for
what
wisconsin
says
is
the
loss.
this
is
an
intolerable
dilemma.
we
don't
know
what
to
do
unless
this
court
reviews
those
two
decisions
and
tells
us
which
one
is
right.
it
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
your
honor,
we
do
ask
that
it
be
reversed
as
one
of
the
alternative
request
we
make.
we
ask
for
review
to
resolve
a
dilemma.
the
answer
is
yes
or
no
as
to
which
--
what's
the
answer
to
this
question,
do
we
have
the
rights,
yes
or
no?
if
you
say
yes,
you
affirm
the
court
of
claims.
if
you
say
no,
we
reverse.
we
ask
you
to
do
one
or
the
other,
either
one
solves
our
dilemma
and
therefore,
we
are
asking
that
you
reverse
not
primarily
but
secondarily
or
alternatively.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
on
the
grounds
that
we
loss
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
our
primary
position
is
that
we
want
review
and
resolution
of
the
dilemma.
we
prefer
affirmance,
we
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
normally,
your
honor,
one
--
it's
almost
never
that
you
have
a
party
before
you
who
really
doesn't
much
care
whether
you
affirm
or
reverse
because
either
decision
is
going
to
be
in
his
favor.
i'm
assuming,
of
course,
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
we
could
fall
back
on
our
alternative
position
and
ask
that
the
court
of
claims
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
we
did
alternatively
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
do
now
state
that
one
of
our
positions,
an
active
litigated
position
is
that
we
want
reversal
of
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
because
they
gave
us
no
money
for
the
loss
of
a
valuable
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
is
the
exact
position
we
had
in
the
court
of
claims
and
they
rejected
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
because
we
would
rather
have
the
rights
as
the
court
of
claims
held
than
money
for
those
rights.
isn't
it
understandable
that
there
are
--
the
tribe
may
have
a
preference
like
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
clearly.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
will
the
court
accept
an
oral
amendment?
we
are
asking
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
two
answer
to
that.
number
1
–
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
it
made
its
point.
i'm
in
a
position
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i'm
in
the
position
to
explain
my
answer
to
that
point
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
in
our
view
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
do
not
deny
the
right
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
be
here.
we
would
have
--
not
objected
to
any
motion
to
intervene.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
if
you
will
accept
--
with
the
position,
i
believe
you
tentatively
have
mr.
justice
black,
our
primary
position
which
is
that
the
court
of
claims
should
be
affirmed
is
--
presents
the
case
to
the
court
in
a
posture
which
is
awkward
to
say
the
least
and
perhaps
the
court
should
reject
and
not
make
a
decision.
but
that
still
is
our
alternative
argument.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
do
ask
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
do
ask
for
a
reversal.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
asked
whom
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
we
asked
them
for
nothing
except
money.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it's
valid?
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
asked
the
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
claims.
we
also
asked
it
to
be
affirmed.
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
court
has
done
that
before,
has
reached
way
back
to
open
up
a
cert
denied
and
grant
that
cert
and
bring
it
in
to
a
case
for
proper
adjudication.
but
mr.
justice
black,
one
final
answer.
if
i
were
to
take
position
you
do,
i
would
reject
and
disregard
our
request
for
an
affirmance
and
treat
the
case
strictly
as
a
request
for
a
reversal.
we
make
both
requests,
i
would
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
didn't
say
i
withdraw
it.
i
said
that
if
i
took
the
position
of
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
reject
that
position.
i
don't'
withdraw
it.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
characterize
you
as
taking
a
final
position
but
i
gather
that
you
felt
that
we
were
not
proper
in
asking
for
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
is
noble.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
one
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
your
honor,
we
consider
taking
that
very
step
and
moving
that
that
be
done
before
this
case
was
argued
and
decided
we
would
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
'63,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
believe,
1963.
yes,
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
we
would
accept
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
will
reserve
such
time
as
i
have
for
rebuttal,
your
honors.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice,
first
in
answer
to
your
own
question
and
that
of
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'm
advised
by
counsel
from
wisconsin
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
does
enforce
it's
hunting
and
fishing
rules
against
the
indians
without
exception
and
thus
collect
the
ordinary
license
fees
from
them.
there
is
no
waiver
or
accommodation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
with
one
exception,
your
honor:
i
must
advise
you
that
since
the
court
of
claims
made
this
decision,
the
state
seems
to
have
weakened
in
the
actual
sending
out
of
game
wardens
under
this
reservation
but
obviously,
it's
holding
its
hand,
depending
on
the
decision
of
this
court.
another
point
i
wanted
to
make,
mr.
claiborne,
in
his
excellent
presentation
mentioned
federal
power
over
these
indian
hunting
and
fishing
rights
lack
of
precedence.
i
would
just
call
your
attention
to
one,
mason
v.
sams
where
the
secretary
of
interior
attempted
--
he
thought
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
to
regulate
the
fishing
rights
of
the
klamath
indians.
and
all
of
the
cases
never
went
beyond
the
federal
district
court.
those
regulations
were
struck
down
as
void.
and
that
finally
and
most
important,
i
want
to
call
the
attention
of
mr.
justice
fortas
to
the
fact
than
in
oregon,
the
klamath
indians
have
an
expressed
right
to
continue
to
fish
after
the
termination
act.
in
other
words,
congress
had
no
idea
that
the
klamath
tribe
would
be
wiped
out,
have
no
more
rights
or
anything
like
that.
they
said
that
the
klamath
would
continue
to
have
fishing
rights.
we
argue
and
the
local
courts
out
there
have
held
that
impliedly
that
also
extends
to
hunting
rights.
we
argue
that
we
are
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
that,
as
the
klamaths.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
met
exactly
the
same
posture
as
the
unmentioned
hunting
rights
requirements.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oh,
yes,
indeed
your
honor.
in
our
brief,
we
cited
three
decisions,
two
by
the
federal
district
court
in
oregon
and
one
by
a
state
local
trial
court
in
oregon.
each
of
which
has
held
that
the
klamath
termination
act,
although
silent
on
hunting
rights
just
like
our
treaty
or
our
termination
act
is
silent
on
hunting
rights,
nevertheless,
that
termination
act
did
not
affect
the
right
of
the
klamaths
to
continue
to
hunt
which
they
had
going
back
to
an
old
treaty,
which
itself
did
not
expressly
mention
hunting
rights
that
their
hunting
right
was
implied
just
as
ours
is.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
the
answer
is
yes,
that
the
klamath
termination
act
expressly
states
that
the
right
of
the
klamaths
to
fish
shall
not
be
--
that
they
shall
continue
to
have
their
right
to
fish
after
termination.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
three
cases
in
oregon
arose
dealing
with
the
hunting
right
which
is
not
mentioned
in
the
klamath
treaty
and
is
not
mentioned
in
the
klamath
termination
act.
nevertheless,
the
court
held
the
right
was
good
and
it
survived
termination.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
correct.
that's
no
doubt
because
we
did
not
have
a
treaty
expressly
granting
the
--
any
rights.
ours
were
implied.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
so
argue
but
with
some
hesitation
because
it's
such
a
prickly
problem.
you'll
notice
in
the
winans
and
(inaudible)
cases,
the
indians
were
held
to
have
a
fishing
right
which
survived
the
patent
from
the
united
states
to
a
non-indian.
the
non-indian
had
to
permit
the
indians
to
come
on
his
land
and
build
smoke
houses
and
fish.
we
would
have
to
argue
the
same.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
too
is
very
troublesome
for
me.
i
think
we
would
take
the
position
that
yes,
they
could
license
it
to
non-indians
but
neither
would
we
be
surprised
nor
regard
it
as
illogical
that
it
be
held
to
be
strictly
purely
an
indian
right,
not
transferable.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oh,
clearly,
no
question;
that
is
true
today,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor,
just
as
that
all
the
indian
reservations
that
are
--
have
not
been
terminated
today.
that
is
the
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
if
they
fish,
they
must
obey
all
state
regulations,
including
season,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
could
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
could
say
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
that's
the
present
law.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
this
case
involves
the
question
whether
the
menominee
indians
still
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
on
their
own
land
without
regard
to
state
bag
limits,
license
fees
and
seasons.
we
and
the
united
states
say
that
they
are
not
subject
to
these
regulations,
contrary
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
which
says
that
they
aren't.
i
will
first
give
you
a
little
background
about
the
menominee
tribe.
this
tribe
was
discovered
so
to
speak
in
1634
by
father
nicolet.
these
indians,
who
today
number
about
3200,
live
in
eastern
wisconsin
where
they
always
have
lived.
they
originally
occupy
the
very
large
section
of
wisconsin
about
12
million
acres.
and
through
a
series
of
sessions,
they
were
reduced
by
1854
to
230,000
acres
which
was
remained
the
size
of
their
reservation
up
to
the
present
day,
this
country
is
forest
and
lake
country.
the
menominee
reservation
is
95%
forest
land.
its
good
quality
forest
land
aboriginally
and
up
until
the
time
of
the
treaties
and
today.
they
have
hunted
and
fished.
this
is
an
excellent
hunting
and
fishing
country
and
also
trapping.
the
reservation
abounds
with
deer,
with
trout
and
with
poultries
such
as
muskrat
and
beaver.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
around
green
bay.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
inland
from
green
bay.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
generally
speaking,
this
tribe
has
enjoyed
peaceful
relations
with
united
states.
they
are
not
one
of
the
hostile
tribes
with
which
united
states
have
to
deal.
as
of
1954,
which
is
the
key
or
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
termination
stage
of
this
case,
they
have
about
3200
members.
the
reservation
as
i
said
consisted
of
about
230,000
acres.
on
this
reservation
was
a
mill
which
belonged
to
the
menominee
tribe
on
the
basis
that
united
states
held
it
in
trust
for
the
menominee
tribe
just
as
it
held
the
reservation
in
trust
for
the
menominee
tribe.
this
mill
processed
the
products
of
the
forest.
it
logged
the
timber
and
then
cut
it
into
lumber
and
marketed
it.
a
number
of
menominee's
several
hundred,
worked
at
this
mill
and
those
who
did
their
average
income
is
about
$2300.00.
for
those
who
did
not,
their
average
income
was
about
$650.00.
the
tribe
owned
a
trust
fund
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
has
about
$9.5
million
as
of
1954.
this
money,
most
of
it
arose
from
a
judgment
against
united
states
for
mismanagement
of
the
tribe's
timber.
the
court
acclaims
after
a
long
trial
held
that
there
had
been
mismanagement
and
that
the
damages
were
$8.5
million.
and
this
tribe
up
until
1954
like
most
other
indian
tribes
was
under
federal
supervision
or
federal
guardianship
as
it
is
sometimes
called.
unlike
most
tribes,
this
tribe
paid
for
that
guardianship.
most
of
the
federal
services
that
came
to
the
tribe,
the
tribe
paid
for
because
it
had
the
money
to
do
so,
thanks
to
its
mill
and
later
its
judgment
fund.
now,
i
will
now
go
back
to
the
treaty
under
which
we
claim
our
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
in
a
two-step
transaction
in
1848
and
1854,
the
menominees
first
seeded
all
of
their
land
in
wisconsin.
the
idea
was
if
they're
going
to
move
to
the
red
wing
reservation
in
minnesota.
but
it
was
understood
at
least
by
the
menominees
and
i
think
generally
understood
that
they're
going
to
take
a
look
at
the
red
wing
reservation
and
see
whether
they
liked
it
or
not.
yes
they
did.
an
exploration
party
went
to
the
minnesota
reservation,
inspected
it
and
came
back
with
stories
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
was
no
good
there.
so
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
refused
to
move.
so
the
united
states
suggested
another
location
for
them.
this
time
the
wolf
river
reservation
which
was
just
north
of
where
they
were
then
camping.
the
menominees
inspected
that
and
they
notice
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
was
excellent.
they
so
stated
and
agreed
to
take
it
and
that's
what
they
did.
they
moved
to
the
wolf
river
reservation
which
is
a
little
north
of
where
they
were
then
camping.
later,
the
state
--
that
was
in
1852.
in
1853,
the
state
of
wisconsin
consented
to
the
setting
aside
of
the
wolf
river
reservation
and
in
1854,
we
come
to
the
treaty
which
is
the
basis
of
this
case.
the
1854
treaty
confirmed
these
events
that
i've
just
finished
describing.
the
tribe
retroceded
its
interest
in
the
red
wing
reservation
and
acquired
its
interest
in
the
wolf
river
reservation
and
that
reservation
was
given
to
them
under
the
following
language,
to
be
held
as
a
--
for
a
home
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held.
now
that
is
the
language
under
which
we
say
we
have
acquired
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
this
protected
the
indian's
aboriginal
customs
to
hunt
and
fish
in
accordance
with
their
way
of
life.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
treaty
language,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
that's
correct.
thank
you
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
now,
until
this
case
arose
in
1954,
no
one
question
these
rights
to
hunt
and
fish
for
the
state
regulation.
but
in
1954,
the
congress
passed
an
act
which
terminated
the
federal
supervision
to
which
i
have
referred.
and
in
general
terms,
it
made
the
state
laws
applicable
to
this
reservation.
the
1954
act
said
nothing
about
exempting
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
for
the
state
regulation
but
during
the
course
of
the
bill
in
congress,
the
joint
committee
was
told
by
the
drafter
of
the
bill,
the
department
of
interior,
that
this
bill
would
not
abrogate
or
affect
any
treaty
rights.
further,
when
the
bill
was
signed
by
president
eisenhower,
the
father
of
the
bill,
senator
watkins
announced
proudly
that
this
bill,
"the
bill
in
no
way
violates
any
treaty
obligation
with
this
tribe."
in
spite
of
these
assurances
as
we
will
see,
wisconsin
claims
that
the
rights
have
been
abrogated
by
this
1954
act.
the
1954
act
gave
the
menominees
a
period
of
time
in
which
to
adjust
to
the
new
conditions
to
make
arrangements
with
the
state
with
the
new
services
which
would
be
required
and
generally
to
transition
from
being
under
federal
supervision
to
being
on
their
own.
and
it
was
not
until
1961
that
the
termination
act
finally
became
effective.
the
termination
plan
which
was
finally
made
effective
in
1961
was
as
follows.
prior
to
termination,
the
tribe
governed
itself,
subject
to
general
and
federal
supervision.the
major
tribal
asset
as
i
said
was
the
menominee
forest
and
the
mill.
and
they
also
have
this
large
cash
trust
fund.
the
other
assets
--
other
tribe
were
tangible
personal
property
associated
with
milling
operation
such
as
their
lumber
inventory
or
milling
equipment.
and
they
had
an
additional
asset
which
was
their
treaty
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
now
all
of
these
assets
except
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
owned
by
the
united
states
entrust
for
the
tribe.
the
united
states
had
the
legal
title
to
all
of
this
property
and
the
tribe
had
the
beneficial
title.
and
the
united
states
kept
careful
accounts
of
all
these
trust
property
and
this
excluded
as
i
say
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
for
several
reasons.
number
one,
the
essential
nature
of
this
right
is
freedom
from
outside
restriction
and
interference
for
the
united
states
to
be
--
to
have
a
guardian's
possession
of
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
right.
it
was
a
treaty
protected
conduct,
number
one.
number
two,
the
united
states
kept
track
of
all
the
property
that
it
own
for
the
tribe
and
this
right
did
not
appear
on
any
of
the
ledgers
or
accounts
that
the
united
states
kept.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
it
is.
for
--
as
we
will
see,
all
of
the
trust
property
was
conveyed
to
the
menominee
corporation
which
i'll
come
to
and
i
therefore
will
argue
that
this
not
being
trust
property
was
not
conveyed
and
remained
in
the
tribe.
now
with
respect
to
the
tribal
property
which
was
predominantly
the
forest
and
the
mill.
the
tribe
decided
that
it
would
set
up
a
private
corporation,
a
business
corporation
under
the
laws
of
wisconsin
to
own
the
land
and
the
mill
and
to
operate
it.
it
was
felt
that
this
would
be
the
most
efficient
way
to
continue
the
business
of
logging
and
milling
the
lumber.
the
profits
would
flow
to
the
members
of
the
tribe
by
making
them
stockholders
of
this
corporation.
with
respect
to
the
tribal
governmental
powers,
the
plan
was
to
make
the
reservation
a
county
under
the
organic
laws
of
wisconsin
and
the
county
would
govern
itself
subject
to
state
supremacy
just
like
any
other
county
of
wisconsin.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
they
were
owned
absolutely
by
the
tribe
which
is
customary
--
a
customary
form
of
ownership
for
indian
property
and
there
are
cases
saying
that
tribal
property
--
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
owned
by
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
and
caused
a
severe
or
perhaps
total
lost
of
their
sovereign
powers.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
your
honor
but
that
is
not
the
only
purpose
of
their
continued
existence.
they
have
a
number
of
local
problems.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
did.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
formed
a
membership
corporation
under
the
laws
of
wisconsin.
that's
like
an
indian
putting
on
white
man's
clothes.
it's
still
an
indian
underneath.
i
don't
want
to
stress
the
corporation
too
much
because
still
the
tribe
is
function
here
although
now
they
are
using
the
organization
of
a
state
membership
corporation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
would
say
there
is
a
question
there
but
of
course
our
position
was
there
was
no
transfer
that
the
tribe
before
and
today,
the
tribe
itself
with
no
transfer
or
change
of
ownership
owns
the
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
right.
we
don't
say
that
could
that
corporation
owns
the
rights.
the
tribe
owns
the
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
but
they
have
taken
on
the
form
of
a
membership
corporation
for
the
purpose
--
they
do
have
some
business
transactions
they
need
to
make.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
exactly,
your
honor.
its
proof
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
correct
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
implied
from
the
language
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held.
so
after
1961,
well,
i'll
make
one
more
point.
after
the
plan
was
implemented,
the
united
states
made
a
number
of
deeds
and
accountings
to
the
tribe
whereby
the
property
was
transferred
from
the
united
states
to
the
new
business
corporation
which
was
called
menominee
enterprises,
inc.
there
are
two
deeds
dealing
with
lands.one
for
forest
lands
and
one
for
non-forest
lands,
these
was
silent
as
to
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
the
accountings
as
to
the
moneys
were
of
course
silent
as
to
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
the
accounting
for
the
personal
property
which
the
mill
inventory,
mill
equipment,
office
furniture
and
the
like,
all
silent
as
to
hunting
and
fishing.
in
other
words,
what
was
transferred
appears
on
paper
somewhere.
every
bit
of
it
was
listed
somewhere
and
no
hunting
and
fishing
rights
appeared.
so
that's
additional
support
for
our
position
as
there
was
no
transfer
of
this
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
have
covered
that
in
the
brief.
our
position
is
that
if
the
tribe
through
blood
delusion
or
let's
says
the
loss
of
their
community
relationship
by
dissipation
among
other
towns
and
cities
of
the
country.
if
they
lost
their
common
traditions
and
existence
as
a
tribe,
a
court
could
examine
the
challenge
to
their
continued
existence
and
find
whether
or
not
they
continued
to
exist
as
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
i
were
the
judge
handling
the
challenge
to
the
continued
existence
of
the
tribe
and
now
we're
faced
with
two
indians
only,
i
might
well
hold
that
the
tribe
as
such
had
ceased
to
exist.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
the
judge
would
have
to
consider
how
many
would
be
necessary.
of
course--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
that
is
basically
correct.
although
we
do
say
that
the
tribe
could
license
others
to
use
them
though
not
exempt
from
state
hunting
and
fishing
laws.
in
other
words,
i
guess
that
would
be
a
land
owner's
right
to
license
others
to
use
them.
excuse
me
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
licensing
others.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
your
honor,
they
do
not
license
others.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
correct.
i
think
it
is
probably
true
that
they
could
only
--
that
only
their
members
could
use
it.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
hunting
and
fishing
right
--
rights
meaning
exemption
from
state
hunting
and
fishing
regulations.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
you
consider
menominee
enterprises
inc.
to
be
a
private
owner,
then
yes.
the
reservation
is
probably
99%
owned
by
menominee
enterprises
inc.
there
are
a
few
private
home
lots
and
the
--
the
roads
belong
to
the
state,
but
basically,
it
belongs
to
menominee
enterprises
inc.
whose
stockholders
are
the
indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
solely
the
former
reservation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
the
local
court
after
these
three
menominees
were
arrested
--
the
local
court
acquitted
them,
and
he
gave
a
long
of
opinion,
which
has
resided
in
our
appendix.
he
had
held
that
the
tribe
still
owned
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
because
they
were
treaty
rights
and
you
can't
abrogate
treaty
rights,
he
said,
by
mere
implication
unless
there's
a
clear
intent
to
do
so,
and
he
didn't
find
that
intent
in
the
1954
termination
act.
so
he
held
they
still
existed.
the
state
appealed
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
held.
sure
enough,
the
tribe
did
have
the
right
originally
but
the
termination
act
did
abrogate
that
right.
and
so,
it
held
that
the
indians
were
subject
to
fine.
we
asked
this
court
to
review
the
case
at
that
time
but
the
certiorari
was
denied.
that
seemed
to
be
the
end
of
our
attempt
to
vindicate
our
rights,
so
we
went
to
the
court
of
claims
and
asked
for
payment
for
the
loss
of
those
rights.
then,
to
our
surprise
but
pleasure,
the
court
of
claims
held
that
we
did
indeed
still
own
the
rights
and
therefore
could
not
recover
compensation.
well,
this
--
we
had
lost
our
first
prize,
we
thought,
and
we're
going
for
the
consolation
prize
in
the
court
of
claims
but
we
lost
the
consolation
prize
on
the
grounds
that
we're
entitled
to
the
first
prize.
so
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
full
face
in
credit,
giving
credit
to
the
wisconsin
judgment?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
i
suppose
no
more
so
than
a
conflict
between
two
circuits
or
any
state
and
federal
court,
which
is
well
within
your
experience.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
the
conflict
of
course
was
the
occasion
for
this
court
accepting
the
case
for
review.
our
position
basically
is
that
the
court
of
claims
was
right.
our
clients,
the
indians,
would
very
clearly
prefer
to
have
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
than
any
compensation
likely
to
be
awarded
for
it.
but
as
an
alternative,
if
they
are
not
entitled
to
the
first
prize,
then
they
want
the
consolation
prize,
which
is
compensation
for
the
loss,
and
they
do
make
that
as
an
alternative
position
here.
since
it's
briefed,
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
it
in
oral
argument
unless
requested.
i
have
four
simple
points
to
make
on
oral
argument.
number
one,
the
tribe
acquired
a
treaty
protected
right
to
hunt
and
fish
free
of
state
regulation
as
of
the
--
as
of
the
1854
treaty.
number
two,
the
1954
termination
act
did
not
cut
off
this
right.
number
three,
the
1954
act
did
not
terminate
the
existence
of
the
tribe.
and
number
four,
ergo,
the
tribe
still
owns
the
right
today.
point
number
one,
the
1854
treaty
guaranteed
the
tribe's
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
this
of
course
is
basic
to
our
case
and
it
is
a
point
which
has
been
accepted
by
every
court
which
has
addressed
it
and
by
two
oregon
courts
which
have
addressed
a
very
similar
question
with
respect
to
the
klamath
indians.
it's
fully
briefed.
i
don't
intend
to
dwell
on
it,
but
i'll
briefly
cover
the
bases
of
it.
the
court
of
claims
in
an
earlier
menominee
case,
in
my
brief,
blue
brief
at
page
six,
i
quote
the
court
of
claims'
findings
in
this
earlier
1942
menominee
case.
the
court
of
claims
found
as
follows,"the
bases,
the
background,
the
previous
history,
and
the
negotiations
leading
up
to
the
1854
treaty
show
that
the
indians
were
desirous
of
securing
hunting
lands
and
that
the
swamp
lands
were
particularly
suited
for
this
purpose
being
filled
with
all
kinds
of
game."
also,
part
of
the
inducement
for
the
moving
of
the
indians
from
their
former
home
to
their
new
home,
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
entering
into
the
new
treaty
was
the
fact
that
the
track
in
question
contains
swamp
lands
which
were
suitable
for
hunting.
what
i'm
saying
is
there
was
an
expressed
understanding
here
between
the
indians
and
the
united
states
that
they
were
to
--
that
hunting
and
fishing
was
important
to
these
indians
and
they
were
to
have
this
right
unrestricted
when
they
moved
on
to
their
new
reservation.
this
understanding
did
not
appear
in
the
treaty
but
it
was
the
same
as
if
it
had
because
of
the
expressed
understanding
of
the
parties.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
you
do
by
reference
to
the
federal
register
where
the
full
plan
was
published.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
reprinted
a
good
part
of
it
in
the
appendix,
their
appendix
in
full.
well,
the
federal
register
material
is
extremely
voluminous.
in
addition
to
the
plan,
they
have
a
lot
of
other
materials
which
bear
on
the
plan,
such
as
the
bylaws
of
the
menominee
enterprises
inc.
since
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
agree
that
we
did
have
the
rights,
there's
no
point
to
belabor
this
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
winans
and
suffolk
are
directly
in
point,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
why?
because
in
those
cases,
the
tribe's
alien
--
the
yakama
tribe
alienated
the
land
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
from
the
treaty.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
shall
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
in
common
with
the
white
settlers.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
to
be
sure,
the
yakama
treaty
was
an
expressed
one
but
we
say
we
have
a
right
of
equal
power
by
implication,
which
was
the
expressed
understanding
of
the
parties
which
did
not
appear
in
the
treaty,
true,
but
was
expressly
understood
by
the
parties.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
is
a
possible
construction
of
that
language.
it's
not
a
construction
accepted
by
any
of
the
courts
which
have
addressed
the
point
so
far.at
wisconsin
trial
court,
wisconsin
supreme
court,
court
of
claims,
u.s.
district
court
in
oregon
and
local
state
court
in
oregon
all
have
concluded
that
this
--
these
rights
did
survive
the
alienation
of
the
land.
but
point
number
two,
the
1954
termination
act
did
not
cut
off
the
treaty
rights.
the
complete
legislative
history
is
given
in
my
brief,
and
i
won't
go
in
into
too
much
detail
here,
but
the
salient
points
are
number
one,
congress
was
told
by
the
drafters
of
the
bill
that
this
bill
would
not
cut
off
any
treaty
rights.
number
two,
the
father
of
the
bill,
senator
watkins,
announced
on
the
signing
of
the
bill
that
this
bill
did
not
violate
any
treaty
rights.
number
three,
the
final
termination
plan
incorporated
as
part
of
itself
public
law
280,
which
was
a
general
act
of
congress
extending
state
laws
on
to
reservations.
and
public
law
280
expressly
preserves
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
the
termination
plan
incorporated
public
law
280
we
say
and
the
court
of
claims
so
found,
which
incorporated
also
the
expressed
protection
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
and
finally,
the
settled
law
of
construction
is
that
treaty
rights,
indian
treaty
rights
will
not
be
deemed
to
be
abrogated
by
implication
unless
absolutely
required
by
an
inconsistent
statute.
the
--
as
i
say,
the
wisconsin
trial
court
held
that
the
rights
survived
the
termination
act.
the
u.s.
district
court
and
this
local
state
court
in
oregon
held
that
the
klamath
rights
survived
the
klamath
termination
act
and
the
dissent
in
the
wisconsin
appeals
court,
the
court
of
--
wisconsin
supreme
court
held
that
the
rights
survived
the
act
and
still
exists.
my
point
--
my
third
point
is
the
termination
act
did
not
terminate
the
tribe.
this
also
is
fully
argued
in
the
brief,
the
orange
colored
brief.
the
court
of
claims
--
it
was
fully
argued
before
the
court
of
claims
and
they
held
that
the
termination
act
did
not
terminate
the
tribe,
and
we
didn't
think
it
was
going
to
be
an
issue
up
here,
which
is
why
we
did
not
argue
it
originally.
when
we
did
find
it
was
an
issue,
we
did
present
our
material
in
the
orange
brief.
and
basically,
it
is
this,
as
federal
indian
law
says
which
is
the
authoritative
textbook
on
indian
law,
the
mere
termination
of
a
tribe
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
termination
--
i
mean
the
termination
of
federal
supervision
of
a
tribe
does
not
necessarily
mean
termination
of
the
tribe
itself.
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
book
was
closed
for
purposes
of
distributing
the
tribal
trust
property,
and
that
was
the
only
purpose
for
that
final
rule.
the
tribe
continues
and
the
tribe
can
continue
to
have
new
members
through
birth
and
other
reasonable
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
one
of
the
toughest
questions
in
all
indian
law,
your
honor.
what
--
we
--
we
simply
must
focus
on
the
precise
--
as
narrow
and
as
precise
a
question
as
possible.
i
have
reserved
15
minutes
for
rebuttal.
i'll
go
into
that
in
a
little
bit,
and
then
we'll
sign
off.
we'll
have
to
look
as
narrowly
as
possible
at
the
definition
of
indian
for
the
particular
case.
in
this
case,
the
definition
--
the
relevant
definition
is
menominee
indian
and
we
say
it
is
what
the
--
basically
what
the
menominee
tribe
says
it
is,
subject
however
to
--
if
there's
a
deviation
from
accepted
--
generally
accepted
indian
concepts
of
who
is
a
member,
then
a
court
could
refuse
to
recognize
the
menominee's
declaration
that
mr.
x
was
a
member
of
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
my
tribe
has
a
--
an
--
in
1934,
congress
passed
an
--
an
enrolment
act
for
the
menominee
tribe,
which
was
later
amended.
basically,
it
says
that
anyone
with
one
quarter
blood
who
was
born
to
parents,
one
of
whom
was
a
resident
of
the
reservation
and
a
member
of
the
tribe,
he
can
be
--
he's
eligible
to
be
a
member
of
the
menominee
tribe.
so
in
short,
a
quarter-blood
menominee
blood
and
parents
who
live
on
the
reservation
and
one
of
them
was
a
member
of
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
people
are
being
born.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
a
very
good
point.
i'm
not
sure
the
tribes
thought
of
that.
i
think
they
still
consider
this
land
as
their
own
land.
but
i
do
say
the
tribe
is
free
to
amend
their
--
their
membership
requirements
so
that
they
could
convert
the
reservation
requirement
into
menominee
county
requirement.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
could,
but
the
court
would
not
--
surely
would
not
recognize
that
because
you
do
not
maintain
tribal
relations
with
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
a
little
over
3200,
your
honor.
that
was
how
many
were
on
the
final
rule.
there
have
been
some
deaths
and
births
since
then.
my
final
point,
which
is
that
the
tribe
still
owns
the
hunting
and
fishing
right,
is
a
secret
there
for
my
other
three
points.
if
they
originally
got
the
right,
if
they
didn't
lose
it
under
the
termination
act,
if
the
tribe
still
exists,
then
they
still
own
the
right
because
it
was
never
conveyed
away
from
them.
only
trust
property
was
conveyed
away
from
them.
and
subject
to
questions,
your
honor,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
hobbs.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
your
honors,
it
would
be
a
very
hard
result
if
these
indians
are
to
lose
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
they've
used
them
since
time
in
memorial.
the
exercise
of
them
has
almost
the
religious
significance
to
them.
it
is
part
of
their
traditions
to
an
extent
far
beyond
that
they're
part
of
our
traditions.
the
indians
have
thought
since
19
--
1854
that
they
had
a
treaty
guarantee
to
hunt
and
fish
because
this
was
so
much
an
important
part
of
the
negotiations
of
that
treaty.
they
would
regard
that
promise
as
broken
if
the
state
now
has
the
power
to
regulate
it.
i
can
assure
you
that
the
only
value
of
this
right
to
these
indians
is
the
immunity
from
state
regulation.
the
fact
that
the
--
they
regard
this
reservation
as
still
owned
for
the
benefit
of
themselves
even
though
technically
it
has
gone
into
the
menominee
corporation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
what's
my
understanding
of
what
he
said
and
we
do
disagree
with
it.our
position
is
that
prior
to
termination,
the
federal
government
did
not
have
a
right
to
regulate
this
right.
it
had
the
power
to
do
so
but
if
it
exercised
that
power
that
would
constitute
of
taking
away.
after
all,
what
was
valuable
here
was
a
right
to
engage
in
conduct
free
of
outside
interference.
when
you
get
right
down
to
it,
you
have
the
sovereign
promising
that
we're
going
to
let
you
hunt
and
fish
on
your
reservation
without
having
to
buy
a
license
and
without
bag
limits
and
seasons.
and
now
for
wisconsin
or
the
federal
government
or
any
other
outside
authority
to
come
in
and
say,
now
you
are
subject
to
bag
limits,
that's
are
a
breach
of
that
original
promise
and
no
matter
how
you
slice
it,
we
must
object
to
it.
we
cannot
go
along
with
that
concept.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
our
business.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
i'm
affirming
that
and
as
far
as
conservation
is
concerned,
please
consider
this.
this
--
thanks
to
state
regulation,
this
reservation
became
over
populated
with
deer
last
fall.
they
had
an
extra
season
to
permit
hunters
to
come
in
and
eliminate
some
of
them
because
they
were
destroying
the
forests.
the
same
with
beavers,
the
three-week
beaver
trapping
season
was
extended
to
three
months
because
of
an
overpopulation
of
beavers
who
were
building
dams
and
flooding
the
roads.
there
was
no
conservation
problem
until
wisconsin
came
in
and
then
it
was
the
opposite
of
a
conservation
problem.
it
was
an
over
population
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
outsiders.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
as
well
as
the
indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
think
they
could
have.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
menominee
enterprises,
the
owner
of
the
reservation
and
the
state,
agreed
in
this
instance
that
outsiders
could
come
in
and
do
some
of
the
hunting.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
consider
for
a
moment
with
the
purpose
of
who
is
the
beneficiary
of
conservation?
it's
the
people
of
the
state.
well,
who
are
the
people
of
the
state?
they're
the
rotten
rail
clubs,
the
field
and
stream
clubs
not
the
indians.
there's
no
expectation
or
desire
of
the
part
of
wisconsin
to
preserve
these
rights
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
unless
they
join
the
rotten
rail
clubs.
consider
the
regulations
themselves.the
indians
are
allowed
under
wisconsin
conservation
laws
to
take
one
deer
per
year.
in
my
original
blue
brief,
it
says
one
deer
a
day
i
believe
which
is
incorrect.
it's
one
deer
per
season
and
there's
one
season
per
year.
they
are
never
allowed
to
take
quail
or
turkey
or
moose
or
elk,
never.
those
are
protected
game
in
wisconsin.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
to
some
extent,
there
is
migration,
your
honor,
of
game.
but
the
game
on
this
reservation
is
largely
with
the
non-migratory
kind,
beavers
and
muskrat
and
deer
are
largely
--
they
don't
roam
too
far.
we
are
conceding
with
the
government
that
to
the
extent,
there
is
a
significant
off
reservation
migration
of
the
game
resource
that
the
people
of
wisconsin
would
have
an
interest,
a
protectable
interest
in
seeing
that
the
indians
didn't
totally
destroy
that
resource
when
it
happened
to
one
or
through
the
reservation.
it's
not
like
the
salmon
cases
where
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
of
course
the
game
officials
looking
at
the
big
picture
--
know
the
migration
roots
of
the
deer
herds.
that's
not
a
difficult
problem
when
viewed
on
that.
it
is
a
difficult
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
only
said
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
question
should
be
reached
if
the
problem
ever
arises
when
the
indians
are
being
unwise
enough
to
totally
extinguish
a
game
resource.
if
that
question
should
arise,
i
think
that's
the
best
time
to
look
and
see
to
what
--
how
the
state
would
implement
it.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
power
of
the
state
is
non
--
no
regulation
at
all
on
the
reservation
except
if
there
was
proof
that
the
indians
were
extinguishing
a
game
resource
which
was
customarily
migrating
off
reservation.
i
think
the
state
would
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
and
have
--
and
seek
some
sort
of
ruling
that
it
could
regulate
the
indians
from
--
prevent
than
join
the
indians
from
destroying
their
game
resource.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
your
honor.
i
would
characterize
it
not
as
a
right
to
regulate
but
rather
a
right
to
seek
an
injunction
to
prevent
destruction
of
a
state
property
right.
there
has
been
i
think
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
would
be
a
--
a
regulation
would
be
an
exercise
of
sovereignty.
i
do
not
concede
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
any
sovereignty
rights
over
these
indian
hunting
and
fishing
rights
because
their
very
essence
is
a
freedom
from
outside
sovereignty
rights
to
regulate
rather
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
people
of
wisconsin
have
a
property
right
in
their
game
resource
outside
of
the
reservation
and
that
property
right
has
with
anyone
else
can
be
vindicated
by
injunction.
it's
a
different
way
of
arriving
at
a
remedy.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
by
injunction.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
the
regulation
of
course
is
much
more
detailed.
it
involves
of
weighing
of
interest
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
is
the
same
as
a
regulation.
it
says,
"thou
shall
not
do
to
us,
so
at
all,"
and
then
it
becomes
like
an
injunction
which
is
a
yes
or
no
type
of
thing.
i
have
a
number
of
small
points
that
i
would
like
to
quickly
cover.
i
think
there
have
been
misunderstandings.
to
my
knowledge,
the
menominee
termination
act
was
not
amended
in
1966.
i
think
that
mr.
lafollette
may
have
in
mind
an
appropriation
by
congress
of
money
for
the
benefit
of
this
reservation
which
was
suffering
terribly
but
i
do
not
believe
this
was
considered
an
amendment
of
the
termination
act.
there's
a
possibility
that
i'm
wrong.
i
don't
think
it
was
an
amendment.
to
my
knowledge,
the
last
amendment
was
in
1960
which
was
four
months
before
the
final
deadline
for
termination.
and
if
anyone
is
interested
in
the
attitude
of
congress
toward
this
termination,
i
commend
them
to
the
hearings
in
this
final
act,
the
final
amendment
to
the
menominee
termination
act.
the
record
is
clear
beyond
any
question
that
termination
was
going
to
come
and
a
matter
of
months
whether
the
indians
were
ready
or
not.
the
secretary
of
interior
was
authorized
to
go
ahead
and
finish
up
the
termination
if
the
indian
didn't
provide
their
own
menominee
enterprises.
the
acts
is
going
to
fall
without
any
further
regard
to
the
desires
of
the
indians.
as
it
happened,
the
indians
did
meet
the
final
deadline.but
if
they
hadn't,
the
termination
would
have
occurred
anyway.
in
the
klamath
treaty,
there
it
was
mentioned
that
there
they
had
a
specific
reservation
of
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
i
think
mr.
claiborne
made
a
point
that
i
will
repeat
it.
the
klamath
case
involved
only
a
specific
preservation
of
fishing
rights.
the
hunting
rights,
which
is
what
all
the
litigation
was
about
was
never
mentioned
on
the
treaty
or
in
the
termination
act
and
thus
making
those
cases
quite
comfortable
to
ours.
the
--
there
--
it
was
said
that
there
are
400
homesteads
that
had
been
conveyed
by
the
corporation.
while
these
homesteads
are
residential
lots
and
the
total
is
probably
less
than
400
acres
and
1%
of
the
reservation
would
be
2300
acres
so
it
looks
like
we're
dealing
with
less
than
a
fourth
of
1%
of
the
reservation
here
that
is
now
in
the
indian's
ownership
as
residential
lots.
the
mason
v.
sams
case
which
the
government
counsel
couldn't
understand
why
it
had
been
adhered
to
all
these
years
was
decided
in
1925
and
not
1905.
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
has
honored
it.
their
--
for
example
in
the
case
of
the
quinault
tribe,
the
quinault
tribe
sells
fishing
licenses.
well,
the
united
states
government
permits
the
tribe
or
at
least
doesn't
say
anything
about
it
to
keep
this
money
on
a
non-trust
account.
in
other
words,
there's
further
evidence
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
a
particularly
close
matter
for
the
tribe
to
govern
themselves
and
not
part
of
the
trust
property.
as
for
the
just
compensability,
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
congress
paid
the
yakima
indians,
and
(inaudible)
and
others,
$27
million
for
the
loss
of
some
fishing
stations
as
a
result
of
dam
built
on
columbia.
again,
they
paid
the
shoshone
$75,000.00
for
the
loss
of
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
all
of
these
are
covered
in
our
brief
under
the
subject
of
compensability
of
the
rights.
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
menominee
indians
live
in
eastern
wisconsin
near
green
bay.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
am
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
am
not
informed,
mr.
chief
justice,
exactly
to
what
extent
if
any
the
state
waives
its
regulations,
my
understanding
is
its
general
enforcement.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
state
does
claim
the
right
to
impose
all
of
its
rules,
including
license
fees
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
on
the
indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
these
indians
have
always
hunted
and
fished
for
subsistence
and
many
of
them
still
do
today.
in
1854,
they
made
a
treaty
with
the
united
states,
giving
up
the
last
of
their
lands
to
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
settling
them
up
with
the
white
settlers.
in
return,
they
received
their
reservation
which,
as
we
shall
see,
gave
them
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
on
that
reservation
according
to
their
customs
without
interference
from
state
or
federal
authorities.
until
1961
no
one
questioned
this
right
to
hunt
and
fish
and
the
indians
peacefully
continued
to
exercise
it.
but
then
congress
in
the
menominee
termination
act
made
the
menominee
reservation
subject
to
state
laws
in
general
without
saying
anything
about
exempting
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish.
the
state
figured
that
that
meant
that
the
right
had
been
extinguished
and
the
game
warden
came
on
the
reservation
and
begun
making
arrests.
this
case
started
in
1962
when
three
menominee
indians
were
arrested
by
the
state
authorities
for
shining
deer,
that
is
hunting
with
the
aid
of
an
artificial
light
and
for
transporting
a
loaded
and
uncased
gun
in
an
automobile.
in
case
you
wonder,
“shining
dear”
means,
you
go
out
on
the
woods
with
the
flashlight
or
an
automobile
headlight
and
when
a
deer
comes
along
and
sees
the
light,
he
looks
at
it
and
freezes.
his
eyes
glow
in
the
dark
and
it
makes
it
perfect
target;
it
makes
it
very
easy
to
shoot
the
dear
and
that's
why
it's
against
the
rule.
it's
unsportsmanlike.
that's
also
the
reason
for
the
rule
against
carrying
an
unloaded
and
uncased
gun
or
a
loaded
and
uncased
gun
in
an
automobile.
it
is
primarily
against
the
law
to
shoot
game
from
an
automobile
and
this
rule
carrying
a
loaded
and
uncased
game
in
an
automobile
is
an
aid
of
the
basic
rule
against
shooting
game
from
an
automobile.
these
are
sportsmanlike
rules
that
happened
to
be
involved
here.
a
law,
of
course,
the
case
does
involve
all
of
the
rules
of
wisconsin
that
apply
to
hunting
and
fishing
of
which
there
are
three
main
purposes:
conservation
is
one;
sportsmanship
is
another;
and
possibly,
though
i
don't
think
so,
safety
might
be
a
third
purpose
for
some
of
these
rules.
while
i'm
on
this
point,
let
me
point
out
some
of
the
other
rules
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
and
would
apply
against
these
indians
subject
to
possible
local
waiver
which
i'm
not
aware
of
it
if
there
is
any.
hunting
licenses
are
required
and
they
cost
from
$2
to
$10
depending
on
the
type
of
hunting
license
that
they
are.
certain
species
can
never
be
shot.
for
example,
quail,
for
example,
elk
and
moose.
if
the
indians
are
subject
to
these
rules,
they
can
never
shoot
moose
or
quail.
there
are
bag
limits
in
seasons.
for
example,
in
the
area
covered
by
this
reservation,
the
bag
limit
for
deer
is
one
deer
per
season
and
the
season
last
for
ten
days
from
november
23rd
to
december
1.
the
brief
inadvertently
said
one
deer
per
day.
if
the
just
--
any
of
the
justices
noted
that,
it's
an
error
for
which
i
apologize.
the
correct
rule
is
one
deer
per
season;
that
is
one
deer
per
year.
there
are
also
the
sporting
rules
about
how
game
may
be
shot:
you
can't
shoot
a
swimming
deer
or
swimming
bear;
you
can't
hunt
with
the
aid
of
an
airplane;
you
can't
shine
deer,
which
has
what
brought
us
to
this
case.
back
to
our
prosecution,
in
the
menominee
--
shawano,
menominee
county
court,
the
indians
admitted
that
they
had
done
what
was
charged
but
they
claimed
the
--
that
the
1854
treaty
gave
them
an
immunity
from
the
prosecution.
judge
fisher
agreed
with
them
and
he
wrote
a
long
opinion
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix,
acquitting
them.
the
state
appealed
under
state
law
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
that
court
by
a
two-to-one
decision
reversed.
they
held
that
the
indians
had
the
hunting
right
under
the
1854
treaty
alright
but
that
that
right
had
been
extinguished
by
the
menominee
termination
act.
the
indians
sought
certiorari
from
this
court
which
was
denied.
that
appeared
to
settle
the
matter
and
so
the
tribe
then
filed
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
seeking
damages
for
the
loss
of
these
valuable
rights.
the
court
of
claims
dismissed
the
claim
on
the
ground
that
the
tribe
still
own
the
right.
now
the
tribe
was
very
pleased
at
this
rationale
because
they
would
much
rather
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
than
they
would
any
compensation
likely
to
be
awarded.
so
although
technically
we
lost
the
law,
we
did
so
for
a
reason
of
which
we
very
much
approved
and
hope
that
this
court
will
affirm.
on
the
basis
of
the
conflict
between
the
court
of
claims
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
this
court
granted
certiorari.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
is
correct.
the
first
time
we
sought
certiorari
from
this
court,
the
government's
position,
although
qualified,
but
basically
was
that
we
no
longer
had
the
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
arguing
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
the
real
opponent
here.
there's
no
question
about
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
are
not
here
except
as
amicus.
they
have
filed
a
brief
and
a
supplemental
memorandum
presenting
their
position
and
therefore,
their
position
is
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
what
i
call
a
supplemental
memorandum,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
your
honor,
i
feel
that
the
state
has
--
actually,
as
a
practical
matter,
presented
its
position
in
its
amicus
brief
which
it
wrote
as
a
brief
on
the
merits
and
in
its
supplemental
memorandum
which
adds
to
explain
the
brief.
the
state
was
on
notice
that
this
case
was
coming
up
here.
the
state
knew
that
its
interest
could
very
well
be
affected
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
court
of
--
the
government
had
moved
to
dismiss
our
case
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
government
took
the
position
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
compensation
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
of
course,
it
was
not
but
you're
asking
when
the
government
first
took
that
position.
there's
not
very
much.
we
--
the
indians
can
do
about
that.
we
can
only
make
sure
the
state
knows
what's
going
on
which
it
did
and
leave
it
to
them
to
take
what
action
seems
in
their
best
interest.
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
correct.
united
states
basic
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
wouldn't
you
regard
that
the
state
has
decided
that
its
interests
are
adequately
protected
by
its
briefs?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
the
state
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
the
state
had
filed
a
motion
for
--
leave
to
intervene
or
for
time
to
argue
which
seems
or
rather
simple
and
obvious
course
perhaps,
that
would
have
been
seriously
considered
by
this
court.
at
least
does
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
certainly
issued
here
the
case.
it's
up
here
regularly
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
claims
between
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
there
is
to
the
extent
that
the
state
has
made
its
position
known
in
the
materials
that
it's
filed
here.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
there's
none.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
in
minor
detail,
there
is
of
course,
the
extent
of
the
right
for
example.
well,
is
the
difference
between
you
and
the
solicitor
general
only
a
minor
difference?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
government
does
say
that
these
particular
regulations
involved
in
this
case,
that
is
shining
dear
and
carrying
a
loaded
gun
in
a
car,
they
say
these
regulations
are
upholdable
on
the
basis
of
safety
in
conservation
that
is
necessary
for
conservation.
of
course,
we
disagree
with
that.
but
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
i
admit
it's
a
big
difference
and
critical
for
this
very
case.
but
the
scope
of
this
case
of
course
is
broader.
but
yes
indeed,
that
brings
to
you
an
adversary
question
to
be
decided.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
state
of
wisconsin
does
and
it
is
an
amicus
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
strictly,
no.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
affirm
the
court
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
we
both
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
want
you
to
affirm
the
court
of
claims.
you'll
notice
that
too
that
we
have
an
alternative
ultimate
position,
which
is
clearly
adversary,
and
that
is
that
if
we
are
wrong
and
do
not
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
today,
then
we
are
entitled
to
compensation
for
it.
and
therefore
the
court
of
claims
is
our
alternative
and
lest
preferred
position
nevertheless
we've
made
it
in
the
brief
and
it's
there,
we
mean
it.
if
we're
wrong
and
don't
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
then
we
want
compensation
and
we
want
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
they
would
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
in
their
brief
they
made
several
statements
which
led
me
to
think
that
possibly
they
do
see
something
to
our
argument
for
compensation.
but
in
the
court
of
claims,
there
was
a
direct
argument
that
we
we're
not
entitled
any
compensation
even
if
we
had
the
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
that's
the
present
position,
your
honor.
yes,
that's
accurate.
they
say
that
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
government
could
regulate
these
rights
prior
to
termination,
the
state
now
has
that
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
without
binding
the
client
who
should
be
consulted
on
something
like
that,
it's
my
own
impression
that
the
government
is
correct
in
that
and
if
there
was
no
change
in
the
scope
of
regulability
of
--
by
the
sovereign
that
which
the
federal
government
had
did
transfer
to
the
state
without
giving
rise
to
a
right
of
compensation
on
our
part.
i
--
my
impression
is
that
the
government
is
correct
in
that
theory.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
if
you
were
to
affirm
per
curiam
without
opinion,
we
will
be
faced
with
an
extensive
additional
litigation
and
this
case
has
been
litigated
since
1962
and
the
tribe
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
under
the
strictest
possible
view
of
judicial
review,
that's
correct.
you
could
affirm
the
court
of
claims
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
yes,
it
would
have
--
it
would
require
further
litigation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
the
decision
of
the
court
did
not
settle
what
is
really
at
issue
here,
which
is,
do
we
still
have
the
rights.
an
affirmance
however
bare
of
the
court
of
claims
would
require
that
the
trial
be
further
litigated.
they
couldn't
let
it
sit
there.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
the
tribe
is
overwhelmingly
interested
in
having
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
they're
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
conflict
that
has
arisen
between
the
court
of
claims
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
can
only
be
decided
here.
there
is
no
alternative.
if
you
can't
decide
it
at
this
time,
the
case
is
before
you,
they
will
come
up
again.
hopefully,
under
such
circumstances
that
certiorari
will
again
be
granted
but
the
state
of
wisconsin
can
certainly
be
expected
to
adhere
to
its
present
position,
which
is
that
we
do
not
have
the
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
would
take
the
opinion
as
meaning
that,
whether
it
said
so
or
not.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
and
we
would
be
--and
then
what
would
remain
would
be
the
definition
of
what
if
any
supervisory
or
regulatory
power
the
state
has
under
the
termination
act,
is
that
correct?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
it
might
further
be
opened
possibly.
i
don't
think
the
state
would
exercise
it
but
technically,
the
state
could
take
the
position
that
it
was
not
bound
by
such
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
since
they
weren't
a
party
and
they
would
have
a
right
to
continue
litigate
until
it
was
a
party.
i
suppose
that's
a
possibility
but
i'm
quite
certain
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
wouldn't
attempt
to
do
such
a
futile
thing.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
not
technically,
mr.
chief
justice
in
so
many
words
but
as
the
practical
effect
of
what
it
has
done
is
to
attempt
to
become
a
party
for
the
purpose
of
filing
its
brief,
it
has
acted
as
a
party.
it
didn't
ask
to
become
one,
no.
i
shall
proceed
if
that
is
the
desire
of
the
justices
with
the
further
argument
on
the
merits.
we
have,
of
course,
homed
in
on
the
peculiar
posture
of
the
case
and
that
is
that
both
the
government
and
we
seek
affirmance
of
the
court
of
claims.
i
would
like
to
give
you
a
little
background
on
the
menominees.
i
don't
know
if
you've
ever
heard
of
them.
they've
been
one
of
the
friendly
tribes
of
america
and
therefore
the
united
states
never
paid
much
attention
to
them
except
on
one
of
their
lands
and
negotiated
sessions
with
them.
there
are
about
3200
members
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
3200.
that
was
as
of
1954.
there
had
been
some
births
and
deaths
since
but
that's
substantially
correct.
they
live
in
the
lake
and
forest
country
of
wisconsin.
their
reservation
is
substantially
a
forest
and
it
occurs
in
the
--
the
whole
area
used
to
be
forest
but
the
area
outside
the
reservation
has
all
been
cut
over
so
that
in
a
sense,
the
reservation
is
like
an
island
of
forest
in
a
surrounding
farmland.
i
don't
mean
to
imply
a
kansas
perry
but
the
farmlands
may
have
tree
stands
here
and
there
but
the
reservation
is
solid
and
it's
prominent
as
you
approach
it
from
a
distance.
they
used
to
hunt
of
course.
they
rely
almost
exclusively
on
hunting
and
fishing
for
their
livelihood.
nowadays,
like
the
rest
of
us,
they
buy
their
food
enclosed
at
the
store.
but
all
--
practically
all
the
male
menominees
still
hunt
and
fish
as
often
as
they
can
get
away
to
do
so.
they
--
and
they
eat
what
they
catch.
it's
a
very
important
activity
to
them
and
as
--
at
least
one
anthropologist
has
noted
hunting
and
fishing
to
indians
seems
to
have
some
symbolic
significance
to
them.
some
--
it
connects
them
to
their
indian
heritage
and
has
almost
a
quasi-religious
meaning
to
the
indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
there
is
no
commercial
activity.
they
may
trade
among
one
another
or
perhaps
a
person
may
eat
part
of
a
deer
and
sell
the
rest
to
a
friend
or
give
it
away
with
their
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
pardon?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
there's
no
commercial
in
the
course
of
any
significance
or
else
i
would
have
heard
of
it.
i'm
not
saying
that
there's
never
any
selling
but
i
don't
know
and
i've
never
heard
of
it
and
i
think
i
would
have.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
correct.
the
tribe
does
not
seek
commercial
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oh,
no!
no,
that's
a
--
that's
one
of
the
implementing
details
in
event
of
an
affirmance.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
think
i
can
answer
it
to
your
satisfaction.
that
rule
was
created
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
the
property
of
the
menominees
under
the
menominee
termination
act.
that
was
the
only
purpose
of
that
roll
was
to
define
the
membership
of
the
tribe
for
the
purpose
of
distribution
of
the
ownership
of
this
forest.
the
roll
was
closed
meaning,
no
newborns
would
get
on
it.
its
--
it
didn't
mean
that
that
was
the
end
of
the
roll.
the
roll
is
still
in
existence
today.
and
as
congress
specified,
only
the
people
named
on
that
roll
are
entitled
to
this
forest,
the
ownership
of
the
menominee
forest,
if
and
when
it's
ever
distributed
or
converted
into
some
sort
of
property
for
them.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
the
menom
--
basically
the
menominee
tribe
subject
to
the
restraint
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
a
good
question.
it
so
happens
right
now
there
is
no
active
formal
organization
of
the
tribe;
therefore,
it
uses
the
corporation
as
its
governing
structure.
but
the
corporation
is
basically
a
business
venture
and
is
in
fact
is
run
by
a
number
of
outsiders
on
the
board
of
directors.
the
--
if
there
--
whenever
a
need
arose,
the
menominees
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
non-indians.
the
board
of
directors
comprises
seven
directors,
as
i
recall,
4
of
whom
are
indians
and
3
are
non-indians.
that's
to
get
expertise
into
the
operation
of
this
corporation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oh,
to
lumber,
to
log
the
woods
and
cut
lumber.
the
menominee
mill,
that's
--
i
didn't
think
to
say
it,
that's
all
they
have.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
it's
not
a
personal
thing;
this
belongs
to
the
tribe.
the
menominee
tribe
was
never
extinguished.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
forest
belongs
to
the
corporation.
the
only
property
transfer,
it
was
property
held
in
trust
by
the
unites
states
your
honor.
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
we
say
are
not
such
a
property.
those
were
property
rights
of
the
unions
not
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
and
did
not
get
transferred
to
the
corporation.
we
say,
our
conceptualization
of
this
is
this:
the
menominee
tribe
is
a
group
of
indians,
which
has
in
effect
a
membership
corporation
under
the
wis
--
laws
of
wisconsin.
however,
that
corporation
does
not
operate
actively
because
there's
no
business
for
it
to
transact.
the
menominees
do
meet
informally
outside
the
structure
of
the
corporation
but
rarely.
the
corporation,
because
the
mill
is
the
business
of
the
menominees,
the
corporation
performs
all
that
business.
as
--
the
casual
observer
might
think
there's
one
entity
here
but
in
reality
there
are
two:
there's
the
visible
corporation
and
there's
the
inactive
and
at
present
invisible
tribal
organization.
now,
the
tribal
organization
consists
of
the
people
on
that
closed
roll
plus
their
descendants
and
they
would
be
the
ones
to
determine
who
are
their
--
who
are
the
proper
members
of
the
menominee
tribe.
that's
standard
rules
for
indians.
basically,
the
indian
tribe
itself
determines
who
shall
be
a
member
of
its
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
think
not.
i
think
just
tribal
trust
property.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
look
at
section
897,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
would
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
my
view
would
be
that
non-trust
property
would
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
tribe
as
it
always
was.
it
never
was
in
the
hands
of
the
united
states
to
convey.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
absolutely
disagree
with
it.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
appearing
in
section
891
states
what
we
think
is
the
correct
view
of
what
happened
here.
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
provide
for
the
orderly
termination
not
of
the
property
and
members
of
the
tribe
but
a
federal
supervision
over
the
property
and
members
of
the
tribe.
that's
what's
been
terminated.
the
federal
benefits,
the
federal
agent
on
the
reservation
that
tells
them
what
to
do,
the
federal
trusteeship
of
the
property
where
the
money
is
in
the
bank
and
the
timber
cannot
be
cut
without
the
government's
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
obviously,
all
federal
statutes
are
--
which
had
been
applicable
to
these
menominees
because
they
were
menominees
are
no
longer
applicable
obviously.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
but
this
statute
did
not
wipe
out
their
treaty
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
some
of
them,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
suppose
--
our
position
of
course
is
that
the
corporation
acquired
only
the
trust
to
property.
but
suppose
the
corporation
acquired
all
their
rights,
including
the
hunting
rights,
the
indian
property
is
communally
owned
and
for
the
corporation
to
own
these
rights
for
the
exercise
of
its
members
would
not
be
anomalous,
would
it?
i'm
not
quite
sure,
i
understand
your
--
the
purpose
here
of
your
question
about
the
plan.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
the
corporation
--
whatever
the
corporation
own,
i
would
agree,
is
owned
through
stock
ownership
by
the
individual
people
on
that
roll
and
no
others,
not
their
descendants.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
without
addition.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
may
i
consult
with
counsel?
the
stock
was
made
inalienable
for
20
years
and
thereafter
the
corporation
has
a
right
of
first
refusal
to
buy
the
stock
if
it
should
ever
be
put
up
for
sale
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
a
second
right
of
refusal
in
said
event.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
this
corporation
is
a
stock
corporation
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
for
a
profit
but
there
is
also
secondly,
a
membership
corporation
which
is
not
active.
it
exists
but
is
not
active.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
i
have
to
decide
that
i
suppose
i
would
say
that
the
right
is
personal
to
the
menominees.
you
see
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
the
--
as
we
argue
the
tribe
of
indians
was
not
abolished
and
if
they
own
the
right,
then
obviously,
it's
owned
only
by
the
members
of
the
tribe.
it
cannot
be
alienated
to
non-indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
forest
did
go
to
the
corporation.
the
corporation
would
not
have
title
to
wildlife
but
the
rights
to
take
that
wildlife
stayed
with
the
tribe.
that's
our
position.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
did
refer
you
to
897
which
said
that
“trust
property”,
i
mean,
it
indicates
to
us
that
only
trust
property
was
transferred
to
the
corporation.
the
united
states
only
transferred
that
property
which
it
held
for
the
tribe
to
the
corporation.
that
property
which
it
did
not
hold
for
the
tribe
which
the
tribe
own
in
its
own
right
without
being
subject
to
trusteeship,
the
tribe
still
owns.
it's
our
position.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
take
the
position
that
before
termination,
the
united
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
say
they
had
some
power
to
prevent
their
abuse
under
their
roll
as
trustee.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
possibly
or
there
may
possibly
be
an
alternative
position
which
was
that
although
there
--
although
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
not
specific
trust
property.
nevertheless,
the
united
states,
as
its
roll
as
general
guardian
of
the
indians,
would
have
the
power
something
different
than
a
trust
title.
we
have
the
power
to
govern
the
menominee's
exercise
of
that
right.
but
if
i'm
wrong
there
then
we
simply
disagree
with
the
government
that
they
had
that
trustee's
power.
another
source
claimed
by
the
government,
they
say
that
the
sovereign,
the
federal
government
before
termination
and
the
state
government
after
termination
would
have
the
same
right
to
regulate
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
as
the
indian's
rights
which
are
off--reservation.
its
--
there's
a
fairly
well
litigated
area
involving
indian
off-reservations
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
and
this
court
held
that
those
off-reservations,
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
can
be
regulated
by
the
state
“where
necessary”
to
achieve
conservation.
and,
under
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
had
construed
that
to
mean
that
in
effect
the
indians
are
subject
to
regulation
to
prevent
them
from
totally
destroying
a
particular
game
resource
which
has
to
be
shared
with
the
non-indians
off
the
reservation.
the
government
says
that
qualified
right
--
a
regulation
was
in
the
federal
government
before
termination
and
is
now
in
the
state
government
after
termination.
we
take
the
position
that
to
the
extent
that
the
fishing
game
on
the
menominee's
reservation
migrated
off
the
reservation.
if
the
migratory
zone
included
in
area
off
the
reservation,
we
would
concede
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
now
has
the
--
the
federal
government
before
termination
and
state
of
wisconsin
now
has
the
power,
without
any
right
of
compensation
in
us
to
do
what
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
menominees
from
destroying
that
resource
because
that
resource
must
be
shared
with
non-indians.
on
the
other
hand,
as
to
a
game
or
fish
resource
which
stays
entirely
on
the
reservation
which
i
think
might
apply
to
squirrels
or
groundhogs,
animals
that
don't
migrate,
we
take
the
position
that
the
federal
government
had
no
power
of
regulation
prior
to
termination
and
that
the
state
has
none
now.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
does
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
your
honor
we
merely
ask
this
court
to
review
the
final
judgment.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
do.
well,
we
do
now
as
an
alternate
position.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
only
if
we
lose
on
our
primary
point
which
is
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
sure
am.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
basically,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
we
do
not.
we
asked
for
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
we
asked
for
review.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
and
it
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
asked
for
review
of
the
dilemma
that
we've
been
put
into.
we
have
got
--
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
saying
we
don't
have
the
rights.
they'll
put
us
in
jail
if
we
exercise
them.
we
have
the
court
of
claims
saying
we
do
have
the
rights
and
therefore
we
can't
be
paid
for
what
wisconsin
says
is
the
loss.
this
is
an
intolerable
dilemma.
we
don't
know
what
to
do
unless
this
court
reviews
those
two
decisions
and
tells
us
which
one
is
right.
it
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
your
honor,
we
do
ask
that
it
be
reversed
as
one
of
the
alternative
request
we
make.
we
ask
for
review
to
resolve
a
dilemma.
the
answer
is
yes
or
no
as
to
which
--
what's
the
answer
to
this
question,
do
we
have
the
rights,
yes
or
no?
if
you
say
yes,
you
affirm
the
court
of
claims.
if
you
say
no,
we
reverse.
we
ask
you
to
do
one
or
the
other,
either
one
solves
our
dilemma
and
therefore,
we
are
asking
that
you
reverse
not
primarily
but
secondarily
or
alternatively.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
on
the
grounds
that
we
loss
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
our
primary
position
is
that
we
want
review
and
resolution
of
the
dilemma.
we
prefer
affirmance,
we
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
normally,
your
honor,
one
--
it's
almost
never
that
you
have
a
party
before
you
who
really
doesn't
much
care
whether
you
affirm
or
reverse
because
either
decision
is
going
to
be
in
his
favor.
i'm
assuming,
of
course,
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
we
could
fall
back
on
our
alternative
position
and
ask
that
the
court
of
claims
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
we
did
alternatively
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
do
now
state
that
one
of
our
positions,
an
active
litigated
position
is
that
we
want
reversal
of
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
because
they
gave
us
no
money
for
the
loss
of
a
valuable
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
is
the
exact
position
we
had
in
the
court
of
claims
and
they
rejected
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
because
we
would
rather
have
the
rights
as
the
court
of
claims
held
than
money
for
those
rights.
isn't
it
understandable
that
there
are
--
the
tribe
may
have
a
preference
like
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
clearly.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
will
the
court
accept
an
oral
amendment?
we
are
asking
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
two
answer
to
that.
number
1
–
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
it
made
its
point.
i'm
in
a
position
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i'm
in
the
position
to
explain
my
answer
to
that
point
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
in
our
view
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
do
not
deny
the
right
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
be
here.
we
would
have
--
not
objected
to
any
motion
to
intervene.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
if
you
will
accept
--
with
the
position,
i
believe
you
tentatively
have
mr.
justice
black,
our
primary
position
which
is
that
the
court
of
claims
should
be
affirmed
is
--
presents
the
case
to
the
court
in
a
posture
which
is
awkward
to
say
the
least
and
perhaps
the
court
should
reject
and
not
make
a
decision.
but
that
still
is
our
alternative
argument.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
do
ask
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
do
ask
for
a
reversal.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
asked
whom
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
we
asked
them
for
nothing
except
money.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it's
valid?
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
asked
the
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
claims.
we
also
asked
it
to
be
affirmed.
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
court
has
done
that
before,
has
reached
way
back
to
open
up
a
cert
denied
and
grant
that
cert
and
bring
it
in
to
a
case
for
proper
adjudication.
but
mr.
justice
black,
one
final
answer.
if
i
were
to
take
position
you
do,
i
would
reject
and
disregard
our
request
for
an
affirmance
and
treat
the
case
strictly
as
a
request
for
a
reversal.
we
make
both
requests,
i
would
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
didn't
say
i
withdraw
it.
i
said
that
if
i
took
the
position
of
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
reject
that
position.
i
don't'
withdraw
it.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
characterize
you
as
taking
a
final
position
but
i
gather
that
you
felt
that
we
were
not
proper
in
asking
for
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
is
noble.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
one
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
your
honor,
we
consider
taking
that
very
step
and
moving
that
that
be
done
before
this
case
was
argued
and
decided
we
would
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
'63,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
believe,
1963.
yes,
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
we
would
accept
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
will
reserve
such
time
as
i
have
for
rebuttal,
your
honors.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice,
first
in
answer
to
your
own
question
and
that
of
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'm
advised
by
counsel
from
wisconsin
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
does
enforce
it's
hunting
and
fishing
rules
against
the
indians
without
exception
and
thus
collect
the
ordinary
license
fees
from
them.
there
is
no
waiver
or
accommodation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
with
one
exception,
your
honor:
i
must
advise
you
that
since
the
court
of
claims
made
this
decision,
the
state
seems
to
have
weakened
in
the
actual
sending
out
of
game
wardens
under
this
reservation
but
obviously,
it's
holding
its
hand,
depending
on
the
decision
of
this
court.
another
point
i
wanted
to
make,
mr.
claiborne,
in
his
excellent
presentation
mentioned
federal
power
over
these
indian
hunting
and
fishing
rights
lack
of
precedence.
i
would
just
call
your
attention
to
one,
mason
v.
sams
where
the
secretary
of
interior
attempted
--
he
thought
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
to
regulate
the
fishing
rights
of
the
klamath
indians.
and
all
of
the
cases
never
went
beyond
the
federal
district
court.
those
regulations
were
struck
down
as
void.
and
that
finally
and
most
important,
i
want
to
call
the
attention
of
mr.
justice
fortas
to
the
fact
than
in
oregon,
the
klamath
indians
have
an
expressed
right
to
continue
to
fish
after
the
termination
act.
in
other
words,
congress
had
no
idea
that
the
klamath
tribe
would
be
wiped
out,
have
no
more
rights
or
anything
like
that.
they
said
that
the
klamath
would
continue
to
have
fishing
rights.
we
argue
and
the
local
courts
out
there
have
held
that
impliedly
that
also
extends
to
hunting
rights.
we
argue
that
we
are
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
that,
as
the
klamaths.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
met
exactly
the
same
posture
as
the
unmentioned
hunting
rights
requirements.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oh,
yes,
indeed
your
honor.
in
our
brief,
we
cited
three
decisions,
two
by
the
federal
district
court
in
oregon
and
one
by
a
state
local
trial
court
in
oregon.
each
of
which
has
held
that
the
klamath
termination
act,
although
silent
on
hunting
rights
just
like
our
treaty
or
our
termination
act
is
silent
on
hunting
rights,
nevertheless,
that
termination
act
did
not
affect
the
right
of
the
klamaths
to
continue
to
hunt
which
they
had
going
back
to
an
old
treaty,
which
itself
did
not
expressly
mention
hunting
rights
that
their
hunting
right
was
implied
just
as
ours
is.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
the
answer
is
yes,
that
the
klamath
termination
act
expressly
states
that
the
right
of
the
klamaths
to
fish
shall
not
be
--
that
they
shall
continue
to
have
their
right
to
fish
after
termination.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
three
cases
in
oregon
arose
dealing
with
the
hunting
right
which
is
not
mentioned
in
the
klamath
treaty
and
is
not
mentioned
in
the
klamath
termination
act.
nevertheless,
the
court
held
the
right
was
good
and
it
survived
termination.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
correct.
that's
no
doubt
because
we
did
not
have
a
treaty
expressly
granting
the
--
any
rights.
ours
were
implied.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
so
argue
but
with
some
hesitation
because
it's
such
a
prickly
problem.
you'll
notice
in
the
winans
and
(inaudible)
cases,
the
indians
were
held
to
have
a
fishing
right
which
survived
the
patent
from
the
united
states
to
a
non-indian.
the
non-indian
had
to
permit
the
indians
to
come
on
his
land
and
build
smoke
houses
and
fish.
we
would
have
to
argue
the
same.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
too
is
very
troublesome
for
me.
i
think
we
would
take
the
position
that
yes,
they
could
license
it
to
non-indians
but
neither
would
we
be
surprised
nor
regard
it
as
illogical
that
it
be
held
to
be
strictly
purely
an
indian
right,
not
transferable.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oh,
clearly,
no
question;
that
is
true
today,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor,
just
as
that
all
the
indian
reservations
that
are
--
have
not
been
terminated
today.
that
is
the
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
if
they
fish,
they
must
obey
all
state
regulations,
including
season,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
could
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
could
say
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
that's
the
present
law.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
this
case
involves
the
question
whether
the
menominee
indians
still
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
on
their
own
land
without
regard
to
state
bag
limits,
license
fees
and
seasons.
we
and
the
united
states
say
that
they
are
not
subject
to
these
regulations,
contrary
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
which
says
that
they
aren't.
i
will
first
give
you
a
little
background
about
the
menominee
tribe.
this
tribe
was
discovered
so
to
speak
in
1634
by
father
nicolet.
these
indians,
who
today
number
about
3200,
live
in
eastern
wisconsin
where
they
always
have
lived.
they
originally
occupy
the
very
large
section
of
wisconsin
about
12
million
acres.
and
through
a
series
of
sessions,
they
were
reduced
by
1854
to
230,000
acres
which
was
remained
the
size
of
their
reservation
up
to
the
present
day,
this
country
is
forest
and
lake
country.
the
menominee
reservation
is
95%
forest
land.
its
good
quality
forest
land
aboriginally
and
up
until
the
time
of
the
treaties
and
today.
they
have
hunted
and
fished.
this
is
an
excellent
hunting
and
fishing
country
and
also
trapping.
the
reservation
abounds
with
deer,
with
trout
and
with
poultries
such
as
muskrat
and
beaver.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
around
green
bay.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
inland
from
green
bay.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
generally
speaking,
this
tribe
has
enjoyed
peaceful
relations
with
united
states.
they
are
not
one
of
the
hostile
tribes
with
which
united
states
have
to
deal.
as
of
1954,
which
is
the
key
or
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
termination
stage
of
this
case,
they
have
about
3200
members.
the
reservation
as
i
said
consisted
of
about
230,000
acres.
on
this
reservation
was
a
mill
which
belonged
to
the
menominee
tribe
on
the
basis
that
united
states
held
it
in
trust
for
the
menominee
tribe
just
as
it
held
the
reservation
in
trust
for
the
menominee
tribe.
this
mill
processed
the
products
of
the
forest.
it
logged
the
timber
and
then
cut
it
into
lumber
and
marketed
it.
a
number
of
menominee's
several
hundred,
worked
at
this
mill
and
those
who
did
their
average
income
is
about
$2300.00.
for
those
who
did
not,
their
average
income
was
about
$650.00.
the
tribe
owned
a
trust
fund
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
has
about
$9.5
million
as
of
1954.
this
money,
most
of
it
arose
from
a
judgment
against
united
states
for
mismanagement
of
the
tribe's
timber.
the
court
acclaims
after
a
long
trial
held
that
there
had
been
mismanagement
and
that
the
damages
were
$8.5
million.
and
this
tribe
up
until
1954
like
most
other
indian
tribes
was
under
federal
supervision
or
federal
guardianship
as
it
is
sometimes
called.
unlike
most
tribes,
this
tribe
paid
for
that
guardianship.
most
of
the
federal
services
that
came
to
the
tribe,
the
tribe
paid
for
because
it
had
the
money
to
do
so,
thanks
to
its
mill
and
later
its
judgment
fund.
now,
i
will
now
go
back
to
the
treaty
under
which
we
claim
our
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
in
a
two-step
transaction
in
1848
and
1854,
the
menominees
first
seeded
all
of
their
land
in
wisconsin.
the
idea
was
if
they're
going
to
move
to
the
red
wing
reservation
in
minnesota.
but
it
was
understood
at
least
by
the
menominees
and
i
think
generally
understood
that
they're
going
to
take
a
look
at
the
red
wing
reservation
and
see
whether
they
liked
it
or
not.
yes
they
did.
an
exploration
party
went
to
the
minnesota
reservation,
inspected
it
and
came
back
with
stories
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
was
no
good
there.
so
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
refused
to
move.
so
the
united
states
suggested
another
location
for
them.
this
time
the
wolf
river
reservation
which
was
just
north
of
where
they
were
then
camping.
the
menominees
inspected
that
and
they
notice
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
was
excellent.
they
so
stated
and
agreed
to
take
it
and
that's
what
they
did.
they
moved
to
the
wolf
river
reservation
which
is
a
little
north
of
where
they
were
then
camping.
later,
the
state
--
that
was
in
1852.
in
1853,
the
state
of
wisconsin
consented
to
the
setting
aside
of
the
wolf
river
reservation
and
in
1854,
we
come
to
the
treaty
which
is
the
basis
of
this
case.
the
1854
treaty
confirmed
these
events
that
i've
just
finished
describing.
the
tribe
retroceded
its
interest
in
the
red
wing
reservation
and
acquired
its
interest
in
the
wolf
river
reservation
and
that
reservation
was
given
to
them
under
the
following
language,
to
be
held
as
a
--
for
a
home
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held.
now
that
is
the
language
under
which
we
say
we
have
acquired
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
this
protected
the
indian's
aboriginal
customs
to
hunt
and
fish
in
accordance
with
their
way
of
life.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
treaty
language,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
that's
correct.
thank
you
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
now,
until
this
case
arose
in
1954,
no
one
question
these
rights
to
hunt
and
fish
for
the
state
regulation.
but
in
1954,
the
congress
passed
an
act
which
terminated
the
federal
supervision
to
which
i
have
referred.
and
in
general
terms,
it
made
the
state
laws
applicable
to
this
reservation.
the
1954
act
said
nothing
about
exempting
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
for
the
state
regulation
but
during
the
course
of
the
bill
in
congress,
the
joint
committee
was
told
by
the
drafter
of
the
bill,
the
department
of
interior,
that
this
bill
would
not
abrogate
or
affect
any
treaty
rights.
further,
when
the
bill
was
signed
by
president
eisenhower,
the
father
of
the
bill,
senator
watkins
announced
proudly
that
this
bill,
"the
bill
in
no
way
violates
any
treaty
obligation
with
this
tribe."
in
spite
of
these
assurances
as
we
will
see,
wisconsin
claims
that
the
rights
have
been
abrogated
by
this
1954
act.
the
1954
act
gave
the
menominees
a
period
of
time
in
which
to
adjust
to
the
new
conditions
to
make
arrangements
with
the
state
with
the
new
services
which
would
be
required
and
generally
to
transition
from
being
under
federal
supervision
to
being
on
their
own.
and
it
was
not
until
1961
that
the
termination
act
finally
became
effective.
the
termination
plan
which
was
finally
made
effective
in
1961
was
as
follows.
prior
to
termination,
the
tribe
governed
itself,
subject
to
general
and
federal
supervision.the
major
tribal
asset
as
i
said
was
the
menominee
forest
and
the
mill.
and
they
also
have
this
large
cash
trust
fund.
the
other
assets
--
other
tribe
were
tangible
personal
property
associated
with
milling
operation
such
as
their
lumber
inventory
or
milling
equipment.
and
they
had
an
additional
asset
which
was
their
treaty
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
now
all
of
these
assets
except
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
owned
by
the
united
states
entrust
for
the
tribe.
the
united
states
had
the
legal
title
to
all
of
this
property
and
the
tribe
had
the
beneficial
title.
and
the
united
states
kept
careful
accounts
of
all
these
trust
property
and
this
excluded
as
i
say
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
for
several
reasons.
number
one,
the
essential
nature
of
this
right
is
freedom
from
outside
restriction
and
interference
for
the
united
states
to
be
--
to
have
a
guardian's
possession
of
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
right.
it
was
a
treaty
protected
conduct,
number
one.
number
two,
the
united
states
kept
track
of
all
the
property
that
it
own
for
the
tribe
and
this
right
did
not
appear
on
any
of
the
ledgers
or
accounts
that
the
united
states
kept.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
it
is.
for
--
as
we
will
see,
all
of
the
trust
property
was
conveyed
to
the
menominee
corporation
which
i'll
come
to
and
i
therefore
will
argue
that
this
not
being
trust
property
was
not
conveyed
and
remained
in
the
tribe.
now
with
respect
to
the
tribal
property
which
was
predominantly
the
forest
and
the
mill.
the
tribe
decided
that
it
would
set
up
a
private
corporation,
a
business
corporation
under
the
laws
of
wisconsin
to
own
the
land
and
the
mill
and
to
operate
it.
it
was
felt
that
this
would
be
the
most
efficient
way
to
continue
the
business
of
logging
and
milling
the
lumber.
the
profits
would
flow
to
the
members
of
the
tribe
by
making
them
stockholders
of
this
corporation.
with
respect
to
the
tribal
governmental
powers,
the
plan
was
to
make
the
reservation
a
county
under
the
organic
laws
of
wisconsin
and
the
county
would
govern
itself
subject
to
state
supremacy
just
like
any
other
county
of
wisconsin.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
they
were
owned
absolutely
by
the
tribe
which
is
customary
--
a
customary
form
of
ownership
for
indian
property
and
there
are
cases
saying
that
tribal
property
--
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
owned
by
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
and
caused
a
severe
or
perhaps
total
lost
of
their
sovereign
powers.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
your
honor
but
that
is
not
the
only
purpose
of
their
continued
existence.
they
have
a
number
of
local
problems.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
did.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
formed
a
membership
corporation
under
the
laws
of
wisconsin.
that's
like
an
indian
putting
on
white
man's
clothes.
it's
still
an
indian
underneath.
i
don't
want
to
stress
the
corporation
too
much
because
still
the
tribe
is
function
here
although
now
they
are
using
the
organization
of
a
state
membership
corporation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
would
say
there
is
a
question
there
but
of
course
our
position
was
there
was
no
transfer
that
the
tribe
before
and
today,
the
tribe
itself
with
no
transfer
or
change
of
ownership
owns
the
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
right.
we
don't
say
that
could
that
corporation
owns
the
rights.
the
tribe
owns
the
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
but
they
have
taken
on
the
form
of
a
membership
corporation
for
the
purpose
--
they
do
have
some
business
transactions
they
need
to
make.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
exactly,
your
honor.
its
proof
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
correct
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
implied
from
the
language
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held.
so
after
1961,
well,
i'll
make
one
more
point.
after
the
plan
was
implemented,
the
united
states
made
a
number
of
deeds
and
accountings
to
the
tribe
whereby
the
property
was
transferred
from
the
united
states
to
the
new
business
corporation
which
was
called
menominee
enterprises,
inc.
there
are
two
deeds
dealing
with
lands.one
for
forest
lands
and
one
for
non-forest
lands,
these
was
silent
as
to
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
the
accountings
as
to
the
moneys
were
of
course
silent
as
to
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
the
accounting
for
the
personal
property
which
the
mill
inventory,
mill
equipment,
office
furniture
and
the
like,
all
silent
as
to
hunting
and
fishing.
in
other
words,
what
was
transferred
appears
on
paper
somewhere.
every
bit
of
it
was
listed
somewhere
and
no
hunting
and
fishing
rights
appeared.
so
that's
additional
support
for
our
position
as
there
was
no
transfer
of
this
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
have
covered
that
in
the
brief.
our
position
is
that
if
the
tribe
through
blood
delusion
or
let's
says
the
loss
of
their
community
relationship
by
dissipation
among
other
towns
and
cities
of
the
country.
if
they
lost
their
common
traditions
and
existence
as
a
tribe,
a
court
could
examine
the
challenge
to
their
continued
existence
and
find
whether
or
not
they
continued
to
exist
as
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
i
were
the
judge
handling
the
challenge
to
the
continued
existence
of
the
tribe
and
now
we're
faced
with
two
indians
only,
i
might
well
hold
that
the
tribe
as
such
had
ceased
to
exist.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
the
judge
would
have
to
consider
how
many
would
be
necessary.
of
course--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
that
is
basically
correct.
although
we
do
say
that
the
tribe
could
license
others
to
use
them
though
not
exempt
from
state
hunting
and
fishing
laws.
in
other
words,
i
guess
that
would
be
a
land
owner's
right
to
license
others
to
use
them.
excuse
me
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
licensing
others.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
your
honor,
they
do
not
license
others.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
correct.
i
think
it
is
probably
true
that
they
could
only
--
that
only
their
members
could
use
it.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
hunting
and
fishing
right
--
rights
meaning
exemption
from
state
hunting
and
fishing
regulations.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
you
consider
menominee
enterprises
inc.
to
be
a
private
owner,
then
yes.
the
reservation
is
probably
99%
owned
by
menominee
enterprises
inc.
there
are
a
few
private
home
lots
and
the
--
the
roads
belong
to
the
state,
but
basically,
it
belongs
to
menominee
enterprises
inc.
whose
stockholders
are
the
indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
solely
the
former
reservation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
the
local
court
after
these
three
menominees
were
arrested
--
the
local
court
acquitted
them,
and
he
gave
a
long
of
opinion,
which
has
resided
in
our
appendix.
he
had
held
that
the
tribe
still
owned
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
because
they
were
treaty
rights
and
you
can't
abrogate
treaty
rights,
he
said,
by
mere
implication
unless
there's
a
clear
intent
to
do
so,
and
he
didn't
find
that
intent
in
the
1954
termination
act.
so
he
held
they
still
existed.
the
state
appealed
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
held.
sure
enough,
the
tribe
did
have
the
right
originally
but
the
termination
act
did
abrogate
that
right.
and
so,
it
held
that
the
indians
were
subject
to
fine.
we
asked
this
court
to
review
the
case
at
that
time
but
the
certiorari
was
denied.
that
seemed
to
be
the
end
of
our
attempt
to
vindicate
our
rights,
so
we
went
to
the
court
of
claims
and
asked
for
payment
for
the
loss
of
those
rights.
then,
to
our
surprise
but
pleasure,
the
court
of
claims
held
that
we
did
indeed
still
own
the
rights
and
therefore
could
not
recover
compensation.
well,
this
--
we
had
lost
our
first
prize,
we
thought,
and
we're
going
for
the
consolation
prize
in
the
court
of
claims
but
we
lost
the
consolation
prize
on
the
grounds
that
we're
entitled
to
the
first
prize.
so
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
full
face
in
credit,
giving
credit
to
the
wisconsin
judgment?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
i
suppose
no
more
so
than
a
conflict
between
two
circuits
or
any
state
and
federal
court,
which
is
well
within
your
experience.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
the
conflict
of
course
was
the
occasion
for
this
court
accepting
the
case
for
review.
our
position
basically
is
that
the
court
of
claims
was
right.
our
clients,
the
indians,
would
very
clearly
prefer
to
have
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
than
any
compensation
likely
to
be
awarded
for
it.
but
as
an
alternative,
if
they
are
not
entitled
to
the
first
prize,
then
they
want
the
consolation
prize,
which
is
compensation
for
the
loss,
and
they
do
make
that
as
an
alternative
position
here.
since
it's
briefed,
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
it
in
oral
argument
unless
requested.
i
have
four
simple
points
to
make
on
oral
argument.
number
one,
the
tribe
acquired
a
treaty
protected
right
to
hunt
and
fish
free
of
state
regulation
as
of
the
--
as
of
the
1854
treaty.
number
two,
the
1954
termination
act
did
not
cut
off
this
right.
number
three,
the
1954
act
did
not
terminate
the
existence
of
the
tribe.
and
number
four,
ergo,
the
tribe
still
owns
the
right
today.
point
number
one,
the
1854
treaty
guaranteed
the
tribe's
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
this
of
course
is
basic
to
our
case
and
it
is
a
point
which
has
been
accepted
by
every
court
which
has
addressed
it
and
by
two
oregon
courts
which
have
addressed
a
very
similar
question
with
respect
to
the
klamath
indians.
it's
fully
briefed.
i
don't
intend
to
dwell
on
it,
but
i'll
briefly
cover
the
bases
of
it.
the
court
of
claims
in
an
earlier
menominee
case,
in
my
brief,
blue
brief
at
page
six,
i
quote
the
court
of
claims'
findings
in
this
earlier
1942
menominee
case.
the
court
of
claims
found
as
follows,"the
bases,
the
background,
the
previous
history,
and
the
negotiations
leading
up
to
the
1854
treaty
show
that
the
indians
were
desirous
of
securing
hunting
lands
and
that
the
swamp
lands
were
particularly
suited
for
this
purpose
being
filled
with
all
kinds
of
game."
also,
part
of
the
inducement
for
the
moving
of
the
indians
from
their
former
home
to
their
new
home,
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
entering
into
the
new
treaty
was
the
fact
that
the
track
in
question
contains
swamp
lands
which
were
suitable
for
hunting.
what
i'm
saying
is
there
was
an
expressed
understanding
here
between
the
indians
and
the
united
states
that
they
were
to
--
that
hunting
and
fishing
was
important
to
these
indians
and
they
were
to
have
this
right
unrestricted
when
they
moved
on
to
their
new
reservation.
this
understanding
did
not
appear
in
the
treaty
but
it
was
the
same
as
if
it
had
because
of
the
expressed
understanding
of
the
parties.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
you
do
by
reference
to
the
federal
register
where
the
full
plan
was
published.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
reprinted
a
good
part
of
it
in
the
appendix,
their
appendix
in
full.
well,
the
federal
register
material
is
extremely
voluminous.
in
addition
to
the
plan,
they
have
a
lot
of
other
materials
which
bear
on
the
plan,
such
as
the
bylaws
of
the
menominee
enterprises
inc.
since
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
agree
that
we
did
have
the
rights,
there's
no
point
to
belabor
this
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
winans
and
suffolk
are
directly
in
point,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
why?
because
in
those
cases,
the
tribe's
alien
--
the
yakama
tribe
alienated
the
land
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
from
the
treaty.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
shall
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
in
common
with
the
white
settlers.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
to
be
sure,
the
yakama
treaty
was
an
expressed
one
but
we
say
we
have
a
right
of
equal
power
by
implication,
which
was
the
expressed
understanding
of
the
parties
which
did
not
appear
in
the
treaty,
true,
but
was
expressly
understood
by
the
parties.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
is
a
possible
construction
of
that
language.
it's
not
a
construction
accepted
by
any
of
the
courts
which
have
addressed
the
point
so
far.at
wisconsin
trial
court,
wisconsin
supreme
court,
court
of
claims,
u.s.
district
court
in
oregon
and
local
state
court
in
oregon
all
have
concluded
that
this
--
these
rights
did
survive
the
alienation
of
the
land.
but
point
number
two,
the
1954
termination
act
did
not
cut
off
the
treaty
rights.
the
complete
legislative
history
is
given
in
my
brief,
and
i
won't
go
in
into
too
much
detail
here,
but
the
salient
points
are
number
one,
congress
was
told
by
the
drafters
of
the
bill
that
this
bill
would
not
cut
off
any
treaty
rights.
number
two,
the
father
of
the
bill,
senator
watkins,
announced
on
the
signing
of
the
bill
that
this
bill
did
not
violate
any
treaty
rights.
number
three,
the
final
termination
plan
incorporated
as
part
of
itself
public
law
280,
which
was
a
general
act
of
congress
extending
state
laws
on
to
reservations.
and
public
law
280
expressly
preserves
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
the
termination
plan
incorporated
public
law
280
we
say
and
the
court
of
claims
so
found,
which
incorporated
also
the
expressed
protection
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
and
finally,
the
settled
law
of
construction
is
that
treaty
rights,
indian
treaty
rights
will
not
be
deemed
to
be
abrogated
by
implication
unless
absolutely
required
by
an
inconsistent
statute.
the
--
as
i
say,
the
wisconsin
trial
court
held
that
the
rights
survived
the
termination
act.
the
u.s.
district
court
and
this
local
state
court
in
oregon
held
that
the
klamath
rights
survived
the
klamath
termination
act
and
the
dissent
in
the
wisconsin
appeals
court,
the
court
of
--
wisconsin
supreme
court
held
that
the
rights
survived
the
act
and
still
exists.
my
point
--
my
third
point
is
the
termination
act
did
not
terminate
the
tribe.
this
also
is
fully
argued
in
the
brief,
the
orange
colored
brief.
the
court
of
claims
--
it
was
fully
argued
before
the
court
of
claims
and
they
held
that
the
termination
act
did
not
terminate
the
tribe,
and
we
didn't
think
it
was
going
to
be
an
issue
up
here,
which
is
why
we
did
not
argue
it
originally.
when
we
did
find
it
was
an
issue,
we
did
present
our
material
in
the
orange
brief.
and
basically,
it
is
this,
as
federal
indian
law
says
which
is
the
authoritative
textbook
on
indian
law,
the
mere
termination
of
a
tribe
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
termination
--
i
mean
the
termination
of
federal
supervision
of
a
tribe
does
not
necessarily
mean
termination
of
the
tribe
itself.
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
book
was
closed
for
purposes
of
distributing
the
tribal
trust
property,
and
that
was
the
only
purpose
for
that
final
rule.
the
tribe
continues
and
the
tribe
can
continue
to
have
new
members
through
birth
and
other
reasonable
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
one
of
the
toughest
questions
in
all
indian
law,
your
honor.
what
--
we
--
we
simply
must
focus
on
the
precise
--
as
narrow
and
as
precise
a
question
as
possible.
i
have
reserved
15
minutes
for
rebuttal.
i'll
go
into
that
in
a
little
bit,
and
then
we'll
sign
off.
we'll
have
to
look
as
narrowly
as
possible
at
the
definition
of
indian
for
the
particular
case.
in
this
case,
the
definition
--
the
relevant
definition
is
menominee
indian
and
we
say
it
is
what
the
--
basically
what
the
menominee
tribe
says
it
is,
subject
however
to
--
if
there's
a
deviation
from
accepted
--
generally
accepted
indian
concepts
of
who
is
a
member,
then
a
court
could
refuse
to
recognize
the
menominee's
declaration
that
mr.
x
was
a
member
of
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
my
tribe
has
a
--
an
--
in
1934,
congress
passed
an
--
an
enrolment
act
for
the
menominee
tribe,
which
was
later
amended.
basically,
it
says
that
anyone
with
one
quarter
blood
who
was
born
to
parents,
one
of
whom
was
a
resident
of
the
reservation
and
a
member
of
the
tribe,
he
can
be
--
he's
eligible
to
be
a
member
of
the
menominee
tribe.
so
in
short,
a
quarter-blood
menominee
blood
and
parents
who
live
on
the
reservation
and
one
of
them
was
a
member
of
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
people
are
being
born.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
a
very
good
point.
i'm
not
sure
the
tribes
thought
of
that.
i
think
they
still
consider
this
land
as
their
own
land.
but
i
do
say
the
tribe
is
free
to
amend
their
--
their
membership
requirements
so
that
they
could
convert
the
reservation
requirement
into
menominee
county
requirement.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
could,
but
the
court
would
not
--
surely
would
not
recognize
that
because
you
do
not
maintain
tribal
relations
with
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
a
little
over
3200,
your
honor.
that
was
how
many
were
on
the
final
rule.
there
have
been
some
deaths
and
births
since
then.
my
final
point,
which
is
that
the
tribe
still
owns
the
hunting
and
fishing
right,
is
a
secret
there
for
my
other
three
points.
if
they
originally
got
the
right,
if
they
didn't
lose
it
under
the
termination
act,
if
the
tribe
still
exists,
then
they
still
own
the
right
because
it
was
never
conveyed
away
from
them.
only
trust
property
was
conveyed
away
from
them.
and
subject
to
questions,
your
honor,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
hobbs.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
your
honors,
it
would
be
a
very
hard
result
if
these
indians
are
to
lose
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
they've
used
them
since
time
in
memorial.
the
exercise
of
them
has
almost
the
religious
significance
to
them.
it
is
part
of
their
traditions
to
an
extent
far
beyond
that
they're
part
of
our
traditions.
the
indians
have
thought
since
19
--
1854
that
they
had
a
treaty
guarantee
to
hunt
and
fish
because
this
was
so
much
an
important
part
of
the
negotiations
of
that
treaty.
they
would
regard
that
promise
as
broken
if
the
state
now
has
the
power
to
regulate
it.
i
can
assure
you
that
the
only
value
of
this
right
to
these
indians
is
the
immunity
from
state
regulation.
the
fact
that
the
--
they
regard
this
reservation
as
still
owned
for
the
benefit
of
themselves
even
though
technically
it
has
gone
into
the
menominee
corporation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
what's
my
understanding
of
what
he
said
and
we
do
disagree
with
it.our
position
is
that
prior
to
termination,
the
federal
government
did
not
have
a
right
to
regulate
this
right.
it
had
the
power
to
do
so
but
if
it
exercised
that
power
that
would
constitute
of
taking
away.
after
all,
what
was
valuable
here
was
a
right
to
engage
in
conduct
free
of
outside
interference.
when
you
get
right
down
to
it,
you
have
the
sovereign
promising
that
we're
going
to
let
you
hunt
and
fish
on
your
reservation
without
having
to
buy
a
license
and
without
bag
limits
and
seasons.
and
now
for
wisconsin
or
the
federal
government
or
any
other
outside
authority
to
come
in
and
say,
now
you
are
subject
to
bag
limits,
that's
are
a
breach
of
that
original
promise
and
no
matter
how
you
slice
it,
we
must
object
to
it.
we
cannot
go
along
with
that
concept.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
our
business.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
i'm
affirming
that
and
as
far
as
conservation
is
concerned,
please
consider
this.
this
--
thanks
to
state
regulation,
this
reservation
became
over
populated
with
deer
last
fall.
they
had
an
extra
season
to
permit
hunters
to
come
in
and
eliminate
some
of
them
because
they
were
destroying
the
forests.
the
same
with
beavers,
the
three-week
beaver
trapping
season
was
extended
to
three
months
because
of
an
overpopulation
of
beavers
who
were
building
dams
and
flooding
the
roads.
there
was
no
conservation
problem
until
wisconsin
came
in
and
then
it
was
the
opposite
of
a
conservation
problem.
it
was
an
over
population
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
outsiders.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
as
well
as
the
indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
think
they
could
have.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
menominee
enterprises,
the
owner
of
the
reservation
and
the
state,
agreed
in
this
instance
that
outsiders
could
come
in
and
do
some
of
the
hunting.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
consider
for
a
moment
with
the
purpose
of
who
is
the
beneficiary
of
conservation?
it's
the
people
of
the
state.
well,
who
are
the
people
of
the
state?
they're
the
rotten
rail
clubs,
the
field
and
stream
clubs
not
the
indians.
there's
no
expectation
or
desire
of
the
part
of
wisconsin
to
preserve
these
rights
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
unless
they
join
the
rotten
rail
clubs.
consider
the
regulations
themselves.the
indians
are
allowed
under
wisconsin
conservation
laws
to
take
one
deer
per
year.
in
my
original
blue
brief,
it
says
one
deer
a
day
i
believe
which
is
incorrect.
it's
one
deer
per
season
and
there's
one
season
per
year.
they
are
never
allowed
to
take
quail
or
turkey
or
moose
or
elk,
never.
those
are
protected
game
in
wisconsin.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
to
some
extent,
there
is
migration,
your
honor,
of
game.
but
the
game
on
this
reservation
is
largely
with
the
non-migratory
kind,
beavers
and
muskrat
and
deer
are
largely
--
they
don't
roam
too
far.
we
are
conceding
with
the
government
that
to
the
extent,
there
is
a
significant
off
reservation
migration
of
the
game
resource
that
the
people
of
wisconsin
would
have
an
interest,
a
protectable
interest
in
seeing
that
the
indians
didn't
totally
destroy
that
resource
when
it
happened
to
one
or
through
the
reservation.
it's
not
like
the
salmon
cases
where
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
of
course
the
game
officials
looking
at
the
big
picture
--
know
the
migration
roots
of
the
deer
herds.
that's
not
a
difficult
problem
when
viewed
on
that.
it
is
a
difficult
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
only
said
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
question
should
be
reached
if
the
problem
ever
arises
when
the
indians
are
being
unwise
enough
to
totally
extinguish
a
game
resource.
if
that
question
should
arise,
i
think
that's
the
best
time
to
look
and
see
to
what
--
how
the
state
would
implement
it.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
power
of
the
state
is
non
--
no
regulation
at
all
on
the
reservation
except
if
there
was
proof
that
the
indians
were
extinguishing
a
game
resource
which
was
customarily
migrating
off
reservation.
i
think
the
state
would
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
and
have
--
and
seek
some
sort
of
ruling
that
it
could
regulate
the
indians
from
--
prevent
than
join
the
indians
from
destroying
their
game
resource.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
your
honor.
i
would
characterize
it
not
as
a
right
to
regulate
but
rather
a
right
to
seek
an
injunction
to
prevent
destruction
of
a
state
property
right.
there
has
been
i
think
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
would
be
a
--
a
regulation
would
be
an
exercise
of
sovereignty.
i
do
not
concede
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
any
sovereignty
rights
over
these
indian
hunting
and
fishing
rights
because
their
very
essence
is
a
freedom
from
outside
sovereignty
rights
to
regulate
rather
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
people
of
wisconsin
have
a
property
right
in
their
game
resource
outside
of
the
reservation
and
that
property
right
has
with
anyone
else
can
be
vindicated
by
injunction.
it's
a
different
way
of
arriving
at
a
remedy.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
by
injunction.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
the
regulation
of
course
is
much
more
detailed.
it
involves
of
weighing
of
interest
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
is
the
same
as
a
regulation.
it
says,
"thou
shall
not
do
to
us,
so
at
all,"
and
then
it
becomes
like
an
injunction
which
is
a
yes
or
no
type
of
thing.
i
have
a
number
of
small
points
that
i
would
like
to
quickly
cover.
i
think
there
have
been
misunderstandings.
to
my
knowledge,
the
menominee
termination
act
was
not
amended
in
1966.
i
think
that
mr.
lafollette
may
have
in
mind
an
appropriation
by
congress
of
money
for
the
benefit
of
this
reservation
which
was
suffering
terribly
but
i
do
not
believe
this
was
considered
an
amendment
of
the
termination
act.
there's
a
possibility
that
i'm
wrong.
i
don't
think
it
was
an
amendment.
to
my
knowledge,
the
last
amendment
was
in
1960
which
was
four
months
before
the
final
deadline
for
termination.
and
if
anyone
is
interested
in
the
attitude
of
congress
toward
this
termination,
i
commend
them
to
the
hearings
in
this
final
act,
the
final
amendment
to
the
menominee
termination
act.
the
record
is
clear
beyond
any
question
that
termination
was
going
to
come
and
a
matter
of
months
whether
the
indians
were
ready
or
not.
the
secretary
of
interior
was
authorized
to
go
ahead
and
finish
up
the
termination
if
the
indian
didn't
provide
their
own
menominee
enterprises.
the
acts
is
going
to
fall
without
any
further
regard
to
the
desires
of
the
indians.
as
it
happened,
the
indians
did
meet
the
final
deadline.but
if
they
hadn't,
the
termination
would
have
occurred
anyway.
in
the
klamath
treaty,
there
it
was
mentioned
that
there
they
had
a
specific
reservation
of
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
i
think
mr.
claiborne
made
a
point
that
i
will
repeat
it.
the
klamath
case
involved
only
a
specific
preservation
of
fishing
rights.
the
hunting
rights,
which
is
what
all
the
litigation
was
about
was
never
mentioned
on
the
treaty
or
in
the
termination
act
and
thus
making
those
cases
quite
comfortable
to
ours.
the
--
there
--
it
was
said
that
there
are
400
homesteads
that
had
been
conveyed
by
the
corporation.
while
these
homesteads
are
residential
lots
and
the
total
is
probably
less
than
400
acres
and
1%
of
the
reservation
would
be
2300
acres
so
it
looks
like
we're
dealing
with
less
than
a
fourth
of
1%
of
the
reservation
here
that
is
now
in
the
indian's
ownership
as
residential
lots.
the
mason
v.
sams
case
which
the
government
counsel
couldn't
understand
why
it
had
been
adhered
to
all
these
years
was
decided
in
1925
and
not
1905.
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
has
honored
it.
their
--
for
example
in
the
case
of
the
quinault
tribe,
the
quinault
tribe
sells
fishing
licenses.
well,
the
united
states
government
permits
the
tribe
or
at
least
doesn't
say
anything
about
it
to
keep
this
money
on
a
non-trust
account.
in
other
words,
there's
further
evidence
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
a
particularly
close
matter
for
the
tribe
to
govern
themselves
and
not
part
of
the
trust
property.
as
for
the
just
compensability,
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
congress
paid
the
yakima
indians,
and
(inaudible)
and
others,
$27
million
for
the
loss
of
some
fishing
stations
as
a
result
of
dam
built
on
columbia.
again,
they
paid
the
shoshone
$75,000.00
for
the
loss
of
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
all
of
these
are
covered
in
our
brief
under
the
subject
of
compensability
of
the
rights.
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court.
