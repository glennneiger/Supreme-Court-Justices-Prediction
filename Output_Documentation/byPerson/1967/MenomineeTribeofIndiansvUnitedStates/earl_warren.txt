chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
if
the
state
requires
them
to
do
all
of
those
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
they
require
them
to
pay
license
fee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
claim
that
right
here
at
least,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
state
of
wisconsin
attempt
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
claims
or
did
it
in
its
brief
amicus
in
this
court
seek
to
become
a
party
to
the
action
or
does
it
in
this
letter
that
we
received
today,
seek
to
become
a
party
to
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
tribe
doesn't
seek
that
either
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
prefer
that
i
--
i
assume
that
is
because
of
the
changed
position
of
the
government
and
the
fact
that
with
relation
to
this
wisconsin
takes
one
position,
the
federal
government
in
its
below
took
another
position
and
it
takes
a
third
position
here
in
your
--
between
the
devil
in
the
deep
blue
sea,
isn't
that
about
what
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
rather
a
noble
position,
aren't
you
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
wisconsin
court
takes
your
property
and
says
that
the
united
states
government
should
pay
for
it.
and
the
united
states
government,
through
its
court
of
claims
says,
“we
don't
take
your
property.
you
are
entitled
to
the
rights
of
the
treaty
and
you
come
here
in
a
dilemma.”
i
wonder
if
mr.
justice
brennan's
suggestion
would
be
aggrieved
to
you
if
we
should
vacate
this
opinion
and
in
order
that
to
be
reargued
along
with
the
wisconsin
case
where
your
people
were
convicted
and
have
that
reargued
together
with
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would
--
that
would
serve
your
purpose
now,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
mister.
mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
just
what
extent
does
the
government
feel
that
wisconsin
has
a
right
to
regulate
the
fishing,
fishing
rights
and
hunting
rights
of
the
individual
members
of
the
tribe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
these
acts
was
such
a
termination
acts
are
a
matter
of
recent
(inaudible),
aren't
they,
and
they
were
brought
into
being
to
fill
a
vacuum
were
they
not
because
the
reservations
throughout
the
country
were
--
neither
the
federal
government
nor
the
state
government
had
jurisdiction
and
the
states
were
invited
to
assume
jurisdiction,
criminal
jurisdiction
and
civil
jurisdiction
so
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
vacuum
in
the
states
and
was
not
intended,
was
it
for
--
to
take
away
any
rights
that
the
indians
had
except
what
rights
might
be
involved
in
giving
that
the
courts
of
those
states'
jurisdiction
over
the
general,
criminal
and
civil
affairs
of
the
indians.

mr.

you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
did
the
government
get
for
--
from
the
indians
for
this?
didn't
they
make
them
law
from
other
lands
because
they
have
--?
chief

earl
warren
and
this
was
a
quid
pro

wasn't
it?
chief

earl
warren
well,
why
is
there
any
difference
between
that
and

chief

was
it

that
the
--
it
should
be

chief

may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask,
mr.
attorney

what
was
the
compensation
to
the
indians
under
your
theory
that
--
that
these
rights
were
abolished
--
chief

earl
warren
--by
the

act?
what
did
the

get
for
it?
chief

earl
warren
but
they
didn't.
they
never
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
that
matter
had
been
fully
debated,
that
they
would
have
taken
these
rights
that
you
--
you
assert
now
away
from
them
--
without
--
without
compensation,
without
something
to
the
indians
to
compensate
for
giving
up
those
rights?
