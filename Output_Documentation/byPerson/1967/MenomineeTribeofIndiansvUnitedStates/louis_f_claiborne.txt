mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
say
--
first
a
word
about
the
unusual
posture
of
the
case
that
has
become
obvious
here.
we
do
have
some
responsibility
for
that
because
back
at
the
'63
term,
the
court
invited
our
views
with
respect
to
this
wisconsin
state
court
litigation
before
the
court
acted
on
granting
--
denying
that
petition
for
certiorari.
we
then
urged
the
court
to
deny
the
petition
or
at
least
we
gave
views
which
would
have
led
to
that
result
if
the
court
had
accepted
them.
they
are
not
in
all
respects
consistent
with
the
views
we
urge
on
the
court
today.
at
all
times,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
there
is
some
state
jurisdiction
to
control
hunting
and
fishing
on
what
was
the
menominee
reservation
and
which
is
now
the
menominee
county.
but
the
extent
to
which
there
may
be
an
immunity
from
state
regulation
is
a
point
on
which
we
have
disagreed
with
ourselves
quite
widely
and
i
think
in
all
fairness,
the
court
should
be
aware
of
that
and
whatever
bearing
that
may
have
on
the
propriety
of
the
suggestion
made
by
justice
brennan
that
that
although
a
denying
certiorari
be
vacated.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
involved
criminal
convictions.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
all.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
confident
the
sentence
has
been
affirmed
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suppose
that
is
true.
here,
when
the
present
petition
was
filed
in
this
court,
we
did
not
oppose
its
grant
although
we
recognized
that
we
would
be
aiding
affirmance
and
that
perhaps
the
petitioners
primarily
wish
deferments
because
we
recognize
that
they
were
in
an
impossible
position
having
the
wisconsin
court,
which
has
jurisdiction
over
the
hunting
part
of
it,
telling
them
they
could
not
hunt
and
fish
except
strictly
in
accordance
with
local
regulations.
and
the
court
of
claims,
going
somewhat
out
of
its
way
to
disagree
with
the
wisconsin
court
and
to
say,
“we
award
no
judgment
of
--
against
the
united
states
because
--
though
they
had
rights,
in
fact
rights
larger
than
we
would
concede
to
be
wholly
immune
in
that
hunting
and
fishing
from
state
regulation.”
those
rights
subsist
wholly
unimpaired
today
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
is
entirely
wrong
in
saying
to
the
contrary,
therefore,
no
judgment
against
the
united
states.
three
members
of
the
court
of
claims,
it
should
be
noted
three
judges,
recognizing
this
impasse
that
was
being
created
suggested
certification
of
the
questions
of
this
court
that
did
not
prevail,
the
majority
for
judges,
voted
against
certification.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
can
only
say,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
we
went
much
too
far
and
that
we
have
recognized
that.
first,
as
far
as
notice
of
our
change
of
position
is
concerned,
that
question
came
up
as
to
whether
wisconsin
it
had
a
proper
opportunity
to
appear
here.
in
august
of
1967,
we
filed
a
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
at
that
time,
we
equivocated
somewhat.
nevertheless,
we
gave,
i
think
adequate
notice
that
we
had
changed
our
position
and
that
we
were
not
at
all
sure
that
they
wouldn't
be
still
today
some
subsisting
immunity
from
state
regulation.
from
that
time
until
this,
wisconsin
might
have
asked
to
participate
in
this
case
in
a
more
active
way
than
simply
by
filing
its
brief
in
a
letter
submitted
this
morning
and
as
--
i'm
confident,
we
would
not
have
opposed
any
such
application
recognizing
that
they
ought
to
be
an
opponent
or
the
other
side
here.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
true
that
our
brief
on
the
merits,
which
clearly
stated
our
position
was
not
filed
until
december
--
months
ago.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
court
of
claims,
as
i'm
advised,
we
took
a
position,
(a)
that
menominees
never
had
any
hunting
and
fishing
rights
granted
by
treaty
and;
(b)
that
they
were
no
longer
a
tribe
and
therefore
if
these
--
if
any
rights
there
were,
they
were
tribal
rights
which
desist
to
exist
upon
what
was
claimed
to
be
a
dissolution
of
the
tribe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
only
i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
termination
act
dissolved
the
tribe
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
therefore
ended
the
rights
but
through
the
other
rule
as
it
were,
by
eliminating
the
beneficiary
rather
than
by
eliminating
the
right
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
must
go
repeat,
mr.
justice
white.
our
first
position
was
there
were
no
rights
therefore
the
termination
act
had
no
effect.
we
then
went
on
to
say
even
if
there
were
rights,
they
were
extinguished
when
the
tribe
was
extinguished.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
by
the
termination
act
and
then
went
on
to
say,
as
you
suggests,
that
of
course
does
not
make
the
united
states
liable
in
damages
for
any
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
rights
recognized
by
the
treaty
and
the
nature
of
the
extinguishment
–
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
have
felt
--
never
been
compelled
to
come
to
a
conclusion
on
that
question
since
one
thing
about
which
we
are
clear
is
that
the
termination
act
did
not
abrogate
whatever
rights
were
granted
by
treaty.
i
think
we
would
have
to
concede
that
there
was
a
serious
question
about
liability.
i
think
they
were
all
defenses
that
would
be
open
to
united
states
even
in
that
circumstance.
i
avoided
arguing
that
aspect
of
the
case
simply
because
it
doesn't
arise
in
our
view,
it
being
quite
clear
it
was,
that
the
termination
act
could
not
sub
silencio
have
meant
to
abrogate
treaty
rights
guaranteed
by
the
united
states,
if
such
there
were
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
our
main
position
is
that
you
don't'
have
to
reach
the
question
of
--
in
order
to
affirm
this
judgment,
we
don't
say
the
court
shouldn't.
we
say
the
court
needn't
reach
the
question
of
the
treaty
rights
because
in
no
event,
the
termination
act
take
anything
away.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
have
difficulties
saying
that
united
states
was
absolutely
free
of
obligation
to
make
compensation
if
one
of
the
rights
granted
were,
as
we
think
was
granted
an
immunity
from
taxation
of
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish.
take
it
that
opposition
would
recognize
the
right
of
the
menominees
to
hunt
and
fish
without
obtaining
this
hunting
licenses
or
fishing
licenses
and
if
that
has
gone
because
of
the
termination
act,
there
might
be
some
obligation
to
make
reparations.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
these
are
tribal
rights
to
be
enjoyed
only
by
the
enrolled
members
of
the
tribe.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
right
is
technically
held
by
a
corporation
or
by
the
tribe
as
a
corporation.
they
are
most
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
indian
tribes,
it
was
all
federal
corporations.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
to
that,
i'm
not
at
all
clear
mr.
justice
fortas
and
i
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
i
would
have
thought
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
all
of
the
plaintiffs,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
all
of
plaintiffs,
alternatively
i
take
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
saying
only,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
they
belong
to
the
indians
whether
or
--
and
to
the
enrolled
members
of
the
menominee
tribe
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
that
whether
they
--
that
is
as
members
of
the
shareholders
in
this
corporation
or
as
members
who
are
enrolled
on
this
final
roll,
i
can't
see
the
big
difference.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
statute
establishes
this
final
tribal
roll
just
about
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
let
me
say
the
court
of
claims
said
these
rights
are
pertaining
to
the
enrolled
members
of
the
tribe
that
is
those
whose
names
appear
on
this
roll
close
to
1954.
district
courts
in
the
klamath
termination
cases
held
expressly
that
the
right
is
limited
to
those
whose
name
appears
on
the
same
type
of
the
final
tribal
roll
and
not
to
otherwise
new
members
of
the
tribe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
--
this
is
of
course,
a
new
problem.
there
is
of
much
law
to
the
effect
that
tribal
rights
cannot
be
alienated
or
can
they
descend
to
individuals;
they
remain
in
the
tribe.
what
happens
when
the
tribe
itself
ceases
to
grow?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
have
thought
of
all
the
problems
presented
by
this
case;
those
problems
clearly
ones
for
the
future
need
not
be
reached
here
if
the
judgment
were
for
affirmance.
let
me
say
in
defense
of
--
by
small
briefs
in
this
case
that
we
have
--
it
is
true,
not
contributed
all
that
we
might
have.
on
the
other
hand,
we've
gone
to
somewhat
further
than
we
need
in
supporting
the
judgment
of
affirmance
of
no
liability
against
united
states.
we
do
point
out
in
our
brief
that
this
case
be
disposed
off
simply
by
affirmance
on
the
ground
that
nobody
really
--
any
longer
claims
the
judgment
against
the
united
states
whatever
the
reasons
may
be.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
does
disturb
me,
mr.
justice
black,
state
of
wisconsin
is
not
actively
participating.
i
assume
they
would
have
been
granted
leave
had
they
ask
for
it.
i
don't
know
that
they've
had
sufficient
knowledge
of
that
fact
and
it
might
be
better
for
the
case
and
for
the
court
if
that
argument
were
continued
and
wisconsin
was
expressly
invited
in
to
represent
the
opposing
view.
as
to
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
do
not.
i
do
see
the
problem
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
solution
which
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
that
it's
a
little
hard
to
reopen
the
case
at
the
‘63
term,
which
in
all
other
respects
is
moot.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
certainly
not
and
the
government
will
be
highly
agreeable
to
that
suggestion.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
inviting
the
states
of
texas
in
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
that
is
correct.
i
don't
know
whether
they
will
--
to
pursue
the
matter
now
or
--
but
it
--
let
me
just
briefly
state
our
position
on
the
merits.
the
--
as
i
said,
the
government's
main
contention
is
that
the
termination
act
had
no
effect
whatever
on
whatever
preexisting
treaty
rights
had
been
conferred.
in
the
first
place,
at
the
time
the
termination
act
was
passed,
congress
was
advised
by
officials
of
the
interior
department
that
treaty
rights
unlike
statutory
rights
would
survive
the
termination
act.
now,
it's
true
that
alternative
proposals
were
put
before
the
congress.
nevertheless,
it
is
likely
that
congress
or
the
congressional
committees
that
considered
this
did
take
the
advice
of
the
interior
officials
who
were
after
all
the
only
experts
before
them
on
this
question
of
indian
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
since
they're
off
reservation
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
(inaudible)
or
i'm
mispronouncing
it
and
nisqually
indian
cases
as
i'm
advised
there
would
be
in
readiness
for
argument
at
the
march
session.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
the
march
session,
i
believe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
--
i
shouldn't
--
the
clerk
can
advice
you
better
than
i
on
that
scope.
those
cases
presented
somewhat
a
different
but
related,
closely
related
issue
in
our
view
might
bear
on
the
decision
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
think
at
least
two,
in
two
respects,
the
rights
of
wis
--
the
state's
prerogative
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
on
this
reservation
is
clear.
one
is,
as
it's
now
conceded,
as
i
understand
it
by
the
petitioner,
insofar
as
this
wildlife
on
the
reservation
is
not
confined
to
the
reservation
but
is
migratory
or
is
otherwise
affects
the
game
beyond
the
borders
of
the
reservation,
clearly
in
the
interest
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
entire
state,
wisconsin
may
see
to
it
that
the
indians,
because
unrestricted
in
other
respects,
do
not
prejudice
the
rights
of
hunters,
commercial
or
otherwise
in
the
remaining
portion
of
the
state.
we
also
think
that
since
the
united
states
had
a
right
to
promulgate
and
enforce
regulations
to
preserve
the
asset
for
the
indians,
that
in
the
service
of
that
same
end,
wisconsin
may
now
make
applicable
some
regulations
of
a
purely
conservation
nature
which
would
tend
to
preserve
this
asset
for
the
benefit
of
indians.
now,
we
do
not
think
the
indians
can
me
made
to
share
this
resource,
which
is,
we
view
it
was
given
them
by
the
treaty
of
1854.
without
this,
it
cannot
be
made
to
allow
other
hunters
to
come
on
their
lands
even
navigable
rivers
or
other
places
which
a
normal
landowner
would
have
to
admit
strangers.
and
as
we've
--
as
i've
said
earlier,
we
do
not
think
that
wisconsin
can
tax
a
privilege
granted
by
treaty
and
there,
it
seems
to
us,
the
tully
case
which,
in
some
respects,
may
be
reargued
in
a
couple
of
months
are
--
is
clear
authority.
if
the
state
cannot
tax
the
privilege,
which
is
non-exclusive
off
the
reservation,
surely
it
cannot
tax
the
privilege
to
hunt,
to
fish
on
the
reservation
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
respect
to
taxation
and
sharing?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
clear
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
clear
what
they
do.
i
think
wisconsin's
position
however,
is
that
there
are
no
special
rules
with
respect
to
what
is
now
menominee
county
and
that
the
unions
have
no
claim
to
be
exempt
from
either
the
absolute
prohibition
on
how
to
--
now
there's
an
area
for
instance
where
it
seem
to
us
that
if
the
indians
were
given
a
right
to
hunt
and
at
the
time
it
included
something
mentioned
now,
“prohibited
quail”
that
while
you
may
be
able
to
regulate
and
hedge
in
that
right,
you
cannot
take
it
away
entirely
by
prohibiting
at
all
times,
at
all
places
hunting
of
quail.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
to
the
extent,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
i
really
don't
know
the
facts
of
the
menominee
reservation.
but
if
they
are,
as
i
think
they
are,
navigable
streams
or
lakes
within
that
very
large
area,
which
now
a
normal
private
landowner
would
control,
the
normal
rule
would
be
that
as
to
those
public
areas
that
is
navigable
streams
and
lakes,
the
landowner
would
be
required
to
admit
strangers
not
so
when
the
case
of
the
indians.
and
that
rule
and
that
difference
is
recognized
in
some
of
the
most
recent
cases,
the
kake
village,
case
70,
metlakatla
indian
case
in
alaska
decided
in
volumes
369
of
u.s.
reports.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
remain
the
problem
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
to
the
extent
that
the
process
they
had
in
the
opinion
gave
notice,
if
only
by
way
of
an
advisory
opinion
to
wisconsin
that
its
own
supreme
court's
decision
had
been
eroded
to
some
extent
assuming
the
court
were
to
file
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
unfortunately
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
clear,
mr.
justice
harlan
whether
there
had
been
some
give
and
take
on
both
sides
or
not.
i
am
clear
that
no
private
permanent
accommodation
has
been
made
between
the
condemning
parties
and
in
that
sense,
the
dispute
is
not
moot
but
it
may
be
that
during
this
period
of
litigation,
the
indians
have
restrained
themselves
and
so
have
the
wisconsin
state
authorities.
i
have
--
i'm
--
i
should
say
that
the
only
alternative
way
of
resolving
this
underlying
conflict
seems
to
be
by
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
wisconsin.
but
it
would
--
seem
a
hard
thing
to
do
to
ask
the
federal
district
court
to
confront
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
only
with
the
view
of
bringing
the
case
eventually
back
here
as
a
way
we
are
arguing
that
case,
in
which
the
sanapaw
case
in
which
certiorari
was
denied.
there
is
a
one
more
word
about
the
termination
act
and
our
view
that
it
does
not
affect
whatever
rights
were
granted.
of
course,
it's
not
to
be
likely
supposed
that
congress
would
repudiate
treaty
rights
once
solemn
be
given.
and
nor
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
congress
would
open
the
united
states
to
a
suit
for
damages
especially
at
the
very
time
when
it
was
trying
to
sever
the
financial
responsibility
of
the
united
states
toward
these
indians
and
to
have
abrogated
treaty
rights
at
least
raises
the
question
of
liability
for
the
government.
and
finally,
there's
nothing
anomalous
about
the
result
that
state
law
in
all
other
respects
applies
to
this
reservation.
the
reservation
is
no
longer
a
reservation
but
simply
menominee
county
and
that
nevertheless
certain
immunities
from
state
regulation
shall
persist
to
prevail.
that
is
the
expressed
provision
of
the
klamath
treaty,
of
the
klamath
termination
act
with
respect
to
fishing
rights.
the
district
court
has
held
it
to
be
true
with
respect
to
hunting
rights
in
the
case
of
the
klamath
indians
even
though
no
mention
is
made
with
respect
to
hunting
rights
in
the
termination
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry,
i've
misled
you,
mr.
justice
black.
it's
the
termination
act
with
the
klamath
passed
a
month
later
than
this
one
with
menominees,
which
says
in
so
many
words
that
this
termination
act
shall
not
affect
the
right,
the
tribal
rights
to
fishing.
that
has
been
held
to
--
has
been
construed
in
(inaudible)
to
have
the
effect
of
saying,
“it
shall
not
affect
the
tribal
rights
to
hunt
or
fish.”
but
more
than
the
point
perhaps
is
public
law
280
passed
in
1954
which
generally
conceded
to
the
states,
both
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
certain
named
so-called
“indian
country”
now
including
most
reservations
throughout
the
country.
and
yet
they
--
the
congressional
policy
was
not
to
allow
the
states
to
impinge
on
fishing
and
hunting
rights
granted
by
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
think
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
do
recognize
that
wisconsin,
for
whatever
reason
and
some
of
them
are
obvious,
has
chosen
to
exercise
that
power
whereas
the
federal
authorities
did
not
and
--
though
they
might
have.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
must
say
mr.
justice
fortas
that
our
failure
to
include
citations
on
that
point
is
not
the
lack
of
research
precisely
because
the
federal
authority
almost
never
exercised
what
we
view
as
this
latent
power
there
is
--
one
can't
go
at
it
by
finding
judicial
decisions
approving
certain
federal
regulations
and
then
saying
to
that
extent,
the
power
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
state.
there
is
just
very
little
law
on
what
federal
power
to
control
hunting
and
fishing
in
reservations
was.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
accustomed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that's
entirely
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
must
add
that
the
“termination
policies”
so-called
has
been
--
was
found
to
be
a
new
advanced
one.
there
were
five
to
six
of
these
termination
acts
and
in
most
instances
or
in
some
at
least
than
in
this
one
it
left
the
indians
very
much
disadvantaged
without
any
of
the
federal
help
that
they've
been
getting
in
the
past
and
not
a
corresponding
help
from
the
state
which,
perhaps,
had
been
helpful.
the
more
--
the
policy
today
is
to
follow
the
procedure
of
allowing
state
law,
civil
and
criminal
state
jurisdiction
to
attach
but
without
all
the
government
savoring
the
federal
link
at
least
until
such
time
as
--
if
ever
the
indians
are
able
economically
to
sustain
themselves
without
such
help.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
is
that
strain,
as
you
noticed,
mr.
justice
black,
but
in
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
to
the
distribution
of
the
tribal
property,
i
think
that
had
always
been
possible
under
the
allotment
acts.
of
course
that
didn't
apply
to
things
like
fishing
rights
which
--
just
in
here,
in
the
tribe
and
were
not
divisible,
didn't
go
with
an
allotment.
it
remained
in
the
members
as
an
indivisible
right
and
so
i
assume.
well
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
i
can
only
urge
that
the
court
do
affirm
the
judgment
below.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
judgment
below
might
be
affirmed
and
the
financial
interest
of
the
united
states
as
a
defendant
in
the
court
of
claims
might
be
fully
vindicated
simply
by
a
holding
that
the
termination
act
did
not
abrogate
whatever,
if
any,
treaty
rights
were
originally
guaranteed
to
these
indians
in
1854.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
say
that
the
court
in
one
sense
need
not
reach
the
question
whether
any
rights
were
conveyed
if
it
concludes
that
the
termination
act
did
not
affect
whatever
rights,
if
any
were
conveyed.
it
is,
however,
our
position
in
order
to
try
to
be
helpful
to
the
court
and
in
the
peculiar
situation
of
the
conflict
between
the
court
of
claims
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
and
the
dilemma
that
leaves
the
petitioners
in,
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
the
other
issues
and
i
tend
to
speak
to
them
now
in
--
in
chronological
order
that
is
first
as
to
our
view.
the
advisory,
as
it
may
be,
is
to
--
what
rights
were
originally
conveyed
were
originally
conveyed
in
1854.
many
thought
it
appropriate
distressed
that
the
outset
of
this
question
in
one
sense
is
not
necessary
to
reach.
in
our
view,
the
treaty
of
wolf
river
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
court
of
claims
has
decided
that
there
were
treaty
rights
and
if
this
court
should
decide
now
that
whatever
rights
were
granted
have
been
destroyed,
i
suppose
it
would
then
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
that
impose
by
the
colony
of
united
states
though
for
that
last
question,
i
should
think
there
ought
to
be
a
remand
since
the
court
of
claims
did
not
address
itself
to
that
viewing
the
termination
act
as
having
taken
nothing
away
from
the
indians.
in
our
view,
the
treaty
of
wolf
river,
when
it
ceded
these
lands
to
the
indians
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held,
in
all
the
circumstances
which
have
been
fully
recited
by
the
petitioners
may
fairly
be
read
to
have
intended
to
give
to
these
indians
the
same
rights
that
they
would
have
had
in
this
land
and
once
did
have
in
this
land
if
it
had
always
been
theirs.
that
is
as
though
this
provision
had
read
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held,
that
is
to
say
with
the
right
to
take
the
wildlife
thereof.
in
other
words,
we
view
the
so-called
hunting
and
fishing
rights
as
an
aspect
of
the
right
to
own
or
possess
these
lands.
we
view
it
as
tied
to
the
right
to
own
or
posses
these
lands.
we
view
it
as
ending
when
the
ownership
or
possession
of
the
land
is
no
longer
in
the
tribe.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
that
the
right
granted,
however,
pertinent
to
the
land
it
may
be,
however,
tied
to
the
land
it
may
be
is
very
much
more
than
a
normal
landowner's
right
with
respect
to
fishing
and
hunting
on
its
own
land.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
a
right
unlike
the
privilege
susceptible
of
being
wholly
or
partly
destroyed
which
an
ordinary
landowner
has
with
respect
to
hunting
and
fishing
on
his
lands.
the
state
can
forbid
him
from
taking
the
wildlife
of
his
own
land
and
conservation
laws
do
often
do
precisely
that
or
they
can
limit
it.
also,
we
suppose
that
this
right
have
been
granted
by
the
united
states
or
it
is
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
in
a
federal
treaty
cannot
be
taxed
by
the
state.
in
that
respect
also,
there
is
something
more
than
a
normal
landowner's
right
with
respect
to
game
and
fish
on
his
land.
and
finally,
to
the
extent
that
the
normal
landowner
would
not
be
able
to
exclude
others
from
these
lands
at
least
those
lands
which
border
on
navigable
rivers
or
the
rivers
themselves,
these
indians
have
a
special
right
because
they
have
an
exclusive
right
to
exclude
all
others
and
cannot
be
made
to
share
their
resource
with
the
other
citizens
of
the
state.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
though
i
will
ultimately
reach
the
question
whether
such
a
conveyance
has
taken
place
here
and
concluded
it
has
not
that
in
--
one
can
look
at
it
in
several
ways
but
it
seems
to
loss
the
technical
way
in
which
to
view
it
perhaps
is
to
be
with
the
cooperation,
that's
not
the
corporation
as
the
fee
owner
of
those
lands
which
have
not
been
puzzled
out
as
homesteads
and
the
tribe
is
the
beneficial
owner,
in
other
words,
cooperation
is
the
substitute
for
the
united
states
trustee
in
the
tribe
as
always
remains
the
beneficial
owner
which
is
what
it
always
was.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
so
long
as
the
membership
in
the
stock
corporation
is
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
under
some
restrictions
and
those
very
restrictions
indicate
to
some
extent
that
this
is
a
kind
of
trusteeship
arrangement.
we
do
not
view
the
right
as
continuing
to
appertain
to
those
small
parts
of
land
which
have
been
alienated
by
the
corporation
to
individual
aliens
because
this
is
a
tribal
right
which
as
we
view
it
appertains
only
to
the
tribal
property
and
must
be
exercised
on
that
land
exclusively.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
it
matters
who
the
stockholders
of
the
nominal
corporation
are
so
long
as
the
tribe
remains
the
beneficial
owner.
but
once
the
new
stockholder
exercises
his
option
to
take
a
plot
of
land
for
his
stock
then
that
plot
of
land
is
no
longer
in
any
sense
subject
to
this
right
of
the
tribe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
i
understand
it
and
that's
only
from
what
was
said
here
today
are
less
than
10%
of
the
total
former
reservation
lands
have
been
puzzled
out
in
what
i
take
to
be
small
homesteads
to
individual
indians.
each
member
of
the
corporation
has
an
option
as
i
understand
it
to
turn
in
a
bond
which
he
receives
for
a
puzzle
land
and
some
have
done
so.
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
mentioned
a
figure
of
500
of
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that's
one
way
of
looking
at
mr.
justice
fortas.
it's
also
true
that
the
other
members
of
the
tribe
can
no
longer
freely
go
on
what
is
now
is
brought
a
homestead
and
of
course
he
retains
whatever
rights
a
normal
land
owner
would
have
with
respect
to
his
plot
of
land
and
he
remains
able
to
hunt
and
fish
on
the
communal
property.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it
as
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
sure
that
the
petitioner
and
we
are
at
one
on
this
question
but
what
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
we
--
as
we
view
it
here,
the
tribe
and
of
course
exercised
by
the
members
of
the
tribe
owns
or
holds
a
right,
a
special
federally
guaranteed
nontaxable
exclusive
right
to
hunt
and
fish
the
wildlife
of
these
lands
as
it
always
did
when
it
was
a
reservation
and
as
usual
with
respect
to
all
reservations,
here
that
right
survives
in
those
lands
which
remain
communal
so
long
as
the
tribe
remains
an
entity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
for
the
--
mr.
justice
fortas
--
for
the
corporation
is
no
more
than
any
other
trustee
whether
it
consist
of
indians
or
non-indians,
whether
it's
the
united
states
or
whether
it's
the
state
of
wisconsin.
it
is
simply
the
shell
which
holds
this
land
in
trust
as
it
were
for
the
tribe
and
all
the
members
thereof,
those
who
have
taken
homestead
and
those
who
have
not.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry.
i
misled
your
honor.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
no
longer
appertain
to
this
plot
which
had
been
alienated
to
the
individual
indian
but
the
individual
indian
by
exercising
his
option
to
take
the
plot
does
not
cease
to
be
a
member
o
the
tribe
and
as
a
member
of
the
tribe,
he
is
entitled
to
continue
to
hunt
and
fish
as
he
always
was
on
that
portion
of
the
former
reservation
which
remains
communally-owned.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
think
that
was
the
result
mr.
justice
white.
and
that
perhaps
points
up
the
fact
that
we
are
not
talking
about
a
right
which
we
now
view
would
last
for
a
time
in
memorial.
it
is
to
be
anticipated
that
gradually
and
at
their
own
chosen
pace,
the
indians
will
cease
to
function
as
the
tribe,
will
cease
to
be
eligible
for
membership
in
the
tribe,
will
alienate
their
lands
and
that
this
communal
property
would
cease
to
be
a
hunting
preserved
for
the
menominees
but
so
long
as
they
have
chosen
to
own
the
property
in
common
or
be
it
now
through
a
corporation
rather
than
as
beneficiaries
of
the
united
states.
and
so
long
as
they
do,
as
they
have
indicated
that
they
wish
to
remain
a
tribe
and
their
right
to
remain
a
tribe
doesn't
depend
on
the
secretary
of
the
interior
of
the
united
states.
the
tribe
existed
before
the
united
states
took
any
notice
of
them
and
can
survive
long
after
the
united
states
ceases
to
have
supervision
over
them.
their
status
as
a
tribe
does
not
depend
upon
their
status
as
wards
of
the
government,
they're
entitled
to
be
a
tribe
as
all
the
authority
is
recognized,
as
long
as
to
choose,
that
is
not
a
question
for
the
government
to
decide
further.
the
effect
of
the
termination
act
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
have
not
conceived
of
it
as
appertaining
to
anyone
other
than
american
indians.
i
suppose
other
organizations
do
depend
on
the
tolerance
of
state
laws
whereas
it
seems
to
me
that
the
continuance
of
the
menominee
tribe
does
not
depend
upon
the
cooperation
of
wisconsin
because
of
their
existence
as
a
community
of
course
long
antedates
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
i
assume
they're
citizens
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
as
they
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
as
all
they've
been
so
since
1924.
now,
to
sum
up
the
nature
of
the
right,
it
seems
to
us
therefore
to
be
a
property
right
not
a
sovereignty
right,
not
a
political
right.
the
consequence
of
that
is
that
we
do
not
view
it
as
a
right
to
be
immune
from
all
outside
regulation
but
as
because
of
the
nature
of
the
property
right
and
because
the
property
right
is
destructible
by
too
much
regulation,
it
of
course
as
every
right
does
carries
with
it
certain
immunities.
we
test
the
degree
of
the
immunity
from
regulation
of
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
by
looking
to
that
immunity
which
is
a
legal
matter
not
as
practical
matter,
as
a
legal
matter,
the
tribe
enjoyed
during
the
hundred
years
when
the
united
states
government
rather
than
the
state
of
wisconsin
had
power
to
regulate
the
hunting
and
fishing
on
this
reservation.
because
the
tribe
owns
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
exclusively,
because
it
has
a
right
to
exclude
all
others,
because
it
has
the
right
to
do
so
free
without
taxation,
no
regulation
by
the
federal
or
state
government
could
destroy
this
right
of
ownership
by
in
effect
making
the
indians
share
their
resource
with
others
whether
under
the
name
of
conservation
or
by
allowing
others
to
trespass
on
their
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
without
compensation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
intended
to
take
away
its
right
is
the
next
point
that
i
invest
myself
to.
for
the
moment,
i'm
simply
trying
to
define
what
right
it
is
that
we're
talking
about
having
survived
as
we
will
conclude
that
it
did
survive
on
the
effect
of
that
determination
i
think.
as
i
say,
the
federal
government
as
guardian
of
the
indians
had
certain
rights
of
regulation
with
respect
to
tribal
property
including
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
those
rights
were
on
the
one
hand
to
conserve
the
resource
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
and
not
to
make
them
share
it
with
others,
to
apportion
it
fairly
among
the
members
of
the
tribe
and
to
conserve
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
future
members
of
the
tribe.
and
likewise,
the
federal
government
had
the
duty
and
the
power
to
protect
others
against
destruction
by
indians
of
the
resource
that
was
not
wholly
theirs
and
so
as
to
migratory
fish
or
fowl,
the
united
states
could
and
we
think
that
the
state
can,
make
sure
that
the
indians
do
not
take
more
than
their
fair
share
of
this
migratory
resource
but
as
to
that
resource
which
is
native
to
the
reservation,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
only
regulation
that
is
proper
is
a
regulation
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
they
well
be
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
no
interest
in
regulating
the
game
on
--
in
menominee
county
for
the
benefit
of
indians
in
which
event,
it
is
of
course
free
to
let
the
indians
regulate
it
themselves.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
there
is
state
power
to
condemn
a
federal
right
--
a
right
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
let
me
say
that
this
does
not
present
an
unusual
or
difficult
problem
for
the
state
of
wisconsin.
every
state
which
has
a
reservation
within
it
is
by
well
settled
law
bound
from
applying
its
fishing
within
that
reservation
and
that
includes
all
those
states
which
otherwise
have
full
jurisdiction
within
the
reservation
civil
and
criminal
public
law
280
which
is
passed
of
the
very
same
session
is
that
this
law
expressly
forbids
that
states
otherwise
may
apply
the
criminal
and
civil
laws
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing.
this
is
not
an
unusual
difficult
problem
which
wisconsin
alone
is
faced
with.
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968
in
title
iv
which
pertains
to
indians
and
which
extends
in
effect
public
law
282,
all
indians
throughout
the
country
again
expressly
reserves
the
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
when
guaranteed
by
federal
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
for
rather
important
point
that
the
termination
act
have
the
effect
of
substituting
whatever
power
of
regulation
there
ever
was
from
the
federal
government
to
the
state
government.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
far
as
the
state
power
to
regulate
within
what
was
formerly
a
reservation
which
is
now
being
terminated,
there
is
only
one
litigated
group
of
cases
other
than
this
one
as
far
as
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
regulate
within
the
reservation
are
--
the
federal
government
has
almost
never
attempted
to
exercise
any
power
whatever
we
maybe
straining
when
we--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
agree.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice
fortas.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
federal
right
which
must
be
respected
by
the
united
states
short
of
the
paying
compensation
for
the
taking
of
it
and
of
course
must
be
respected
by
the
states
and
to
the
extent
that
that
right
survives
termination.
it
cannot
be
impinged
upon
now
by
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
state
of
wisconsin
now
has
by
virtue
of
the
termination
act
and
even
without
the
termination
act
by
virtue
of
the
removal
of
the
federal
fence
around
these
lands,
the
state
has
power
to
bring
its
law
into
the
reservation
and
to
do
all
regulation
with
respect
to
this
hunting
and
fishing
rights
short
of
interfering
with
exercising
of
rights.
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
i
understand
the
nature
of
a
right,
it
carries
with
it
an
immunity
from
interference
and
all
i'm
saying
that
is
--
that
since
the
right
to
granted
here
is
an
exclusive
ownership
of
this
resource,
nothing
can
be
done
which
takes
away
from
the
indians
that
exclusive
ownership.
that
does
not
however
prevent
an
apportionment
of
the
asset
among
the
tribe
or
a
preservation
of
the
asset
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
and
its
future
members.
that
maybe
a
very
small
thing
to
concede
to
wisconsin
and
it
may
well
be
that
wisconsin
will
determine
that
it
doesn't
care
about
helping
the
indians.
it
rather
let
them
help
themselves.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
saying
that
precisely
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
do
say
that
the
indians
have
something
special
which
a
normal
landowner
does
not
have
which
is
a
right
as
opposed
to
a
mere
tolerance
of
privilege
granted
by
the
state
or
federal
treaty
right
to
take
the
wildlife
of
their
reservation.
that
is
an
unusual
and
extraordinary
right.
it
is
a
power
that
is
well
recognized
with
the
indian
right.
it
is
a
right
which
it
seems
to
us
goes
with
indian
tenure.
it
does
not
go
with
the
white
man's
tenure
of
property
and
it
is
precisely
that
which
we
cannot
conceive
that
the
congress
intended
to
abrogate
merely
because
it
allowed
wisconsin's
laws
in
other
respects
to
take
hold
on
these
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
my
first
answer
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
it
does
differ
and
the
reason
it
does
differ
is
because
the
indian
land
tenure
carries
with
it
a
right,
an
absolute
right,
a
exclusive
right,
an
unusual
right,
an
extraordinary
right
to
take
the
wildlife
which
is
found
on
that
land.
a
right
which
no
private
landowner
any
of
the
states
i
know
of,
has
except
by
tolerance
or
by
grant
from
the
state.
here,
whether
the
state
likes
it
or
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
wholly
unregulated
mr.
justice
stewart
because
as
i
said,
it
can
be
regulated
for
their
own
benefit,
and
also
and
this
maybe
quite
involved
in
the
case
of
the
menominee
reservation
to
the
extent
that
this
resource
is
not
wholly
native
to
the
reservation.
there's
a
salmon
stream
that
begins
there
and
--
but
does
go
on
into
the
next
county.
it
seems
to
us
perfectly
clear
that
the
federal
government
could
have
and
perhaps
should
have
and
that
the
state
now
can
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
as
the
new
guardian
but
simply
as
exercising
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
sovereign
power
of
government
against
what
was
never
an
immunity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
a
case
mr.
justice
douglas
which
says
it
does
not
hold
that
the
federal
government
did
have
a
right
to
regulate
the
portion
of
the
stream
that
was
within
the
reservation.
now,
i
know
that
mason
against
sams
is
the
opposite.
that's
a
district
court
opinion
in
1905
and
it
somewhat
baffles
me
why
it's
been
uh
accepted
as
the
law
ever
since
but
without
appeal
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
did
in
that
case.
that
was
the
quinault
reservation
and
it
purported
to
say
how
many
nets
could
be
established
at
what
locations
and
then
provided
further
that
since
they
have
a
few
locations
and
only
a
few
indians
who
would
benefit
from
it,
the
--
those
who
hold
the
nets
must
pay
a
fee
which
was
turned
over
to
the
tribe
and
then
distributed
evenly
among
members.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
rationale
of
the
decision
maybe
that
secretary
of
the
interior
without
congressional
authorization
had
no
right
to
do
this.
of
course,
as
your
honor
well
knows,
the
government
did
and
always
has
control
timber
and
grazing
operations
on
reservations
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
to
preserve
the
asset
and
to
distribute
it
evenly.
there
is
no
distinction
in
principle
why
the
same
cannot
be
true
of
fishing
wildlife.
and
in
re
blackbird
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
says
that
this
can
be
done,
but
the
state
cannot
do
what
the
federal
government
can.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
question
but
the
congress
has
constitutional
power
to
abrogate
any
treaty
with
indians.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
more
--
the
more
recent
cases
indicate
quite
clearly
that
there
would
be
an
obligation
of
paying
compensation
if
what
have
been
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
there
is
a
forum
--
if
there
is
a
jurisdictional
act
which
permits
it
and
i
didn't
get
that
since
1946.
there
has
been
such
a
forum.
prior
to
that
there
was
no
and
except
for
a
special
jurisdictional
acts
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
shoshone
case.
okay,
this
very
case
of
course,
the
court
of
claims
took
the
view
that
if
i'm
talking
about
property
rights
and
we
have
to
assume
that
what
we
are
speaking
of
here
is
an
aspect
of
--
well
not
all
--
not
all
treaty
guarantees
maybe
compensable
but
property
rights
are
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
created
by
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
which
is
what
we
say
this
is,
what
seem
compensable.
i
must
add
that
in
this
case,
there
is
an
argument
which
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
make
here
now
that
the
indians
consented
to
the
abrogation
of
the
treaty
by
agreeing
to
termination.
that
question,
however,
has
embarrassments
because
the
indians
were
pretty
much
told
you
won't
get
your
$9
million
unless
you
agree
with
the
termination.
and
furthermore,
they
may
have
be
said
to
have
agreed
to
it
on
condition
that
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
preserved
as
their
attorney
as
the
congressional
committee's
to
do
but
i
cannot
say
that
it
would
automatically
follow.
that
would
be
a
question
on
remand
as
to
whether
liability
will
be
viewed
in
this
case
if
it
were
concluded
to
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
had
been
taken
away.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice.
it's
sighted
in
the
petitioners
brief.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
case
in
this
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
rough,
that
is
if
with
the
caveat
i
mentioned
about
the
consent
of
the
taking
by
agreeing
to
termination.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
with
the
further
caveat
that
the
court
would
of
course
have
to
find
that
we
would
urge
the
court
so
find
despite
our
self-interest,
there
was
at
the
treaty
property
right
involved
and
secondly
that
there
now
is
a
tribe
who
can
continue
to
enjoy
the
right
and
therefore
a
proper
plaintiff
could
bring
this
action
in
the
court
of
claims.
let
me
say
a
word
about
what
is
most
central
to
this
case
which
is
the
effect
of
the
termination
act.
i
will
simply
summarize
the
reasons,
most
of
which
have
already
been
spoken
here,
why
in
our
view,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
termination
act
have
no
intent
to
abrogate
whatever
hunting
and
fishing
rights
had
been
granted
by
the
treaty
of
1854.
in
the
first
place,
of
course,
it
is
against
the
normal
presumption
that
the
congress
would
repudiate
the
solemn
treaty
it
had
made
with
the
indians
and
especially
that
it
would
do
so,
we're
in
complete
silence
and
without
making
any
provision
for
adequate
compensation
for
the
taking
of
that
right.
we
surely
know
the
presumption
that
congress
was
not
about
such
unfortunate
business.
now
the
--
it
is
true
that
the
treaty
--
that
the
termination
act
says
that
federal
law
shall
no
longer
apply
and
that
state
laws
shall
apply.
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
language
is
uniform
in
the
ten
termination
acts.
this
was
the
first
termination
act.
it
was
very
badly
written
and
there
are
more
careful
provisions
when
inserted.
the
same
language
appears
in
the
klamath
termination
act
where
it
has
been
held
that
first,
the
fishing
rights
which
are
expressly
preserved
were
of
course
not
taken
but
also
the
hunting
rights
which
are
nowhere
mentioned
is
preserved
will
also
survive
termination.
now,
relevant
to
the
particular
legislative
history
of
this
act
is
the
statement
of
two
witnesses
from
the
interior
department,
one
of
them
is
the
assistant
secretary
who
were
the
drafters
of
this
law
and
who
assured
the
committee
that
the
termination
act
even
though
it
did
not
expressly
preserved
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
not
touch
it.
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
congressional
committees
and
the
congress
as
a
whole
listen
to
that
advise
and
felt
that
they
were
not
by
this
act
interfering
with
whatever
hunting
and
fishing
to
menominees
had
previously
enjoyed.
this
is
further
indicated
by
the
fact
that
at
the
same
con
--
at
the
same
congress,
at
the
same
session,
the
congress
when
generally
providing
for
the
application
of
state
laws
within
indian
country
had
said,
"all
criminal
laws
shall
apply.
all
civil
laws
shall
apply
if
the
state
so
chooses
but
they
shall
not
have
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
guaranteed
by
the
treaty
with
the
united
state."
the
congress
will
be
doing
that
on
one
hand
and
here
to
be
letting
the
menominee
hunting
and
fishing
rights
go
by
the
board
in
silence
seems
they're
all
are
extraordinary
things
to
assume.
i
finally,
as
i
think
mr.
justice
white
was
pointing
out
a
moment
ago,
the
termination
act
itself
says,
that
that
the
plan
which
is
to
be
submitted
by
the
indians
shall
contain
provision
for
the
wildlife,
safety
and
protection
of
the
wildlife
and
fish.
now,
that
would
seem
wholly
unnecessary
if
the
state
fishing
game
laws
were
going
to
be
fully
applicable.
why
should
the
indians
be
making
provision
to
preserve
this
asset
of
theirs?
and
finally,
the
exposure
of
the
government
to
monetary
damages,
if
treaty
rights
were
being
taken
or
would
suggest
that
the
congress
did
not
mean
to
produce
that
result
at
the
very
time
when
it
was
concerned
about
relieving
the
government
of
its
financial
obligation
to
the
indians
resulting
from
the
various
services
which
had
been
provided
in
the
past.
there
is
nothing
inherently
inconsistent
about
termination
of
federal
supervision
and
continuance
of
treaty
rights
on
the
one
hand
and
survival
of
the
tribe
on
the
other
hand.
what
was
terminated
were
both
powers
and
the
duties
of
the
united
states
government
vis-à-vis
the
indians.
but
the
indians'
existence
as
a
tribe
does
not
--
it
has
depended
on
the
united
states
as
their
guardian.
and
these
treaty
rights
of
course
can
exist,
can
be
respected
by
the
state
and
can
be
enforced
by
the
federal
government
if
necessary
without
there
being
any
federal
guardianship
over
these
indians
just
as
the
off
reservation
treaty
rights
which
were
discussed
in
the
case
last
session,
exists
quite
independently
of
any
federal
supervision
over
those
indians
or
for
that
matter
any
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
accustomed
hunting
and
fishing
places.
the
federal
treaty
right
can
survive
without
federal
guardianship.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
must
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
answer
this
way
mr.
justice
white.
there
are
strong
indications
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
very
letter
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
the
chairman
of
the
congressional
committee,
explaining
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
had
refused
to
acquiesce
or
to
favorably
recommend
the
bill
which
had
been
introduced
by
congressman
laird
to
divide
this
fund
of
$9
million
in
to
and
in
less
the
menominee's
agreed
to
the
termination
of
federal
supervision
and
--
but
congressman
laird
accused
to
the
committee
of
having
a
force
termination
on
the
indians.
there
is
certainly
a
question
as
to
whether
they're
consent
which
they
didn't
make
what's
free
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
the
congress
view
that
it
wished
to
have
the
consent
of
the
indians.
whether
there
would
have
been
a
termination
in
the
absence
of
the
consent
of
the
indians,
i
don't
know.
the
consent,
however,
maybe
have
been
obtained
by
saying,
"you'll
get
your
money
if
you
agree
to
this."
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
when
i
take
it
as
a
--
as
a
constitutional
matter,
a
termination
would
not
have
required
to
consent
the
indian
and
that
the
congress
would
have
been
free
to
proceed
ahead.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
true,
if
and
not
only
if
they
were
taking
anything
in
way
of
the
property
right
away
which
show
we
strongly
urge
was
not
the
case.
now,
one
word
about
the
future
as
i've
already
said,
we
view
these
rights
as
continuing
in
the
tribe
which
itself
continues.
indians
have
by
various
acts
indicated
their
desire
to
remain
a
tribe.
they
have
by
preserving
most
of
their
reservation
lands
as
a
whole
indicated
their
wish
to
continue
to
live
communally
and
to
own
their
land
communally
whether
that's
through
a
corporation
or
otherwise
for
all
practical
purposes
as
is
the
same
way
of
life
they
live
as
before.
they
have
only
recently,
between
the
two
arguments
in
this
case,
adopted
new
rules
for
membership.
they
have
opened
the
rule
which
it
seems
to
us
they
have
the
right
to
do.
but
they
have
followed
the
secretary
of
interior's
rules
as
to
what
constitutes
a
bona
fide
member
which
rules
seem
reasonable
unlike
mr.
justice
douglas'
indians,
they
can
find
their
membership
to
those
of
the
quarter
blood
and
require
that
if
his
one
parent
was
a
resident
to
the
reservation
at
the
time
of
birth,
and
as
i
said
before
these
conditions
are
not
likely
to
last
forever,
so
there
should
be
no
fear
that
this
enclave
will
last
in
perpetuity
and
yet
these
are
very
necessary
and
very
valuable
rights
would
be
allowed
to
be
preserved
to
the
indians
for
all
these
inter
period.
we
urge
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
say
--
first
a
word
about
the
unusual
posture
of
the
case
that
has
become
obvious
here.
we
do
have
some
responsibility
for
that
because
back
at
the
'63
term,
the
court
invited
our
views
with
respect
to
this
wisconsin
state
court
litigation
before
the
court
acted
on
granting
--
denying
that
petition
for
certiorari.
we
then
urged
the
court
to
deny
the
petition
or
at
least
we
gave
views
which
would
have
led
to
that
result
if
the
court
had
accepted
them.
they
are
not
in
all
respects
consistent
with
the
views
we
urge
on
the
court
today.
at
all
times,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
there
is
some
state
jurisdiction
to
control
hunting
and
fishing
on
what
was
the
menominee
reservation
and
which
is
now
the
menominee
county.
but
the
extent
to
which
there
may
be
an
immunity
from
state
regulation
is
a
point
on
which
we
have
disagreed
with
ourselves
quite
widely
and
i
think
in
all
fairness,
the
court
should
be
aware
of
that
and
whatever
bearing
that
may
have
on
the
propriety
of
the
suggestion
made
by
justice
brennan
that
that
although
a
denying
certiorari
be
vacated.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
involved
criminal
convictions.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
all.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
confident
the
sentence
has
been
affirmed
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suppose
that
is
true.
here,
when
the
present
petition
was
filed
in
this
court,
we
did
not
oppose
its
grant
although
we
recognized
that
we
would
be
aiding
affirmance
and
that
perhaps
the
petitioners
primarily
wish
deferments
because
we
recognize
that
they
were
in
an
impossible
position
having
the
wisconsin
court,
which
has
jurisdiction
over
the
hunting
part
of
it,
telling
them
they
could
not
hunt
and
fish
except
strictly
in
accordance
with
local
regulations.
and
the
court
of
claims,
going
somewhat
out
of
its
way
to
disagree
with
the
wisconsin
court
and
to
say,
“we
award
no
judgment
of
--
against
the
united
states
because
--
though
they
had
rights,
in
fact
rights
larger
than
we
would
concede
to
be
wholly
immune
in
that
hunting
and
fishing
from
state
regulation.”
those
rights
subsist
wholly
unimpaired
today
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
is
entirely
wrong
in
saying
to
the
contrary,
therefore,
no
judgment
against
the
united
states.
three
members
of
the
court
of
claims,
it
should
be
noted
three
judges,
recognizing
this
impasse
that
was
being
created
suggested
certification
of
the
questions
of
this
court
that
did
not
prevail,
the
majority
for
judges,
voted
against
certification.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
can
only
say,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
we
went
much
too
far
and
that
we
have
recognized
that.
first,
as
far
as
notice
of
our
change
of
position
is
concerned,
that
question
came
up
as
to
whether
wisconsin
it
had
a
proper
opportunity
to
appear
here.
in
august
of
1967,
we
filed
a
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
at
that
time,
we
equivocated
somewhat.
nevertheless,
we
gave,
i
think
adequate
notice
that
we
had
changed
our
position
and
that
we
were
not
at
all
sure
that
they
wouldn't
be
still
today
some
subsisting
immunity
from
state
regulation.
from
that
time
until
this,
wisconsin
might
have
asked
to
participate
in
this
case
in
a
more
active
way
than
simply
by
filing
its
brief
in
a
letter
submitted
this
morning
and
as
--
i'm
confident,
we
would
not
have
opposed
any
such
application
recognizing
that
they
ought
to
be
an
opponent
or
the
other
side
here.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
true
that
our
brief
on
the
merits,
which
clearly
stated
our
position
was
not
filed
until
december
--
months
ago.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
court
of
claims,
as
i'm
advised,
we
took
a
position,
(a)
that
menominees
never
had
any
hunting
and
fishing
rights
granted
by
treaty
and;
(b)
that
they
were
no
longer
a
tribe
and
therefore
if
these
--
if
any
rights
there
were,
they
were
tribal
rights
which
desist
to
exist
upon
what
was
claimed
to
be
a
dissolution
of
the
tribe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
only
i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
termination
act
dissolved
the
tribe
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
therefore
ended
the
rights
but
through
the
other
rule
as
it
were,
by
eliminating
the
beneficiary
rather
than
by
eliminating
the
right
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
must
go
repeat,
mr.
justice
white.
our
first
position
was
there
were
no
rights
therefore
the
termination
act
had
no
effect.
we
then
went
on
to
say
even
if
there
were
rights,
they
were
extinguished
when
the
tribe
was
extinguished.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
by
the
termination
act
and
then
went
on
to
say,
as
you
suggests,
that
of
course
does
not
make
the
united
states
liable
in
damages
for
any
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
rights
recognized
by
the
treaty
and
the
nature
of
the
extinguishment
–
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
have
felt
--
never
been
compelled
to
come
to
a
conclusion
on
that
question
since
one
thing
about
which
we
are
clear
is
that
the
termination
act
did
not
abrogate
whatever
rights
were
granted
by
treaty.
i
think
we
would
have
to
concede
that
there
was
a
serious
question
about
liability.
i
think
they
were
all
defenses
that
would
be
open
to
united
states
even
in
that
circumstance.
i
avoided
arguing
that
aspect
of
the
case
simply
because
it
doesn't
arise
in
our
view,
it
being
quite
clear
it
was,
that
the
termination
act
could
not
sub
silencio
have
meant
to
abrogate
treaty
rights
guaranteed
by
the
united
states,
if
such
there
were
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
our
main
position
is
that
you
don't'
have
to
reach
the
question
of
--
in
order
to
affirm
this
judgment,
we
don't
say
the
court
shouldn't.
we
say
the
court
needn't
reach
the
question
of
the
treaty
rights
because
in
no
event,
the
termination
act
take
anything
away.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
have
difficulties
saying
that
united
states
was
absolutely
free
of
obligation
to
make
compensation
if
one
of
the
rights
granted
were,
as
we
think
was
granted
an
immunity
from
taxation
of
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish.
take
it
that
opposition
would
recognize
the
right
of
the
menominees
to
hunt
and
fish
without
obtaining
this
hunting
licenses
or
fishing
licenses
and
if
that
has
gone
because
of
the
termination
act,
there
might
be
some
obligation
to
make
reparations.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
these
are
tribal
rights
to
be
enjoyed
only
by
the
enrolled
members
of
the
tribe.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
right
is
technically
held
by
a
corporation
or
by
the
tribe
as
a
corporation.
they
are
most
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
indian
tribes,
it
was
all
federal
corporations.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
to
that,
i'm
not
at
all
clear
mr.
justice
fortas
and
i
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
i
would
have
thought
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
all
of
the
plaintiffs,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
all
of
plaintiffs,
alternatively
i
take
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
saying
only,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
they
belong
to
the
indians
whether
or
--
and
to
the
enrolled
members
of
the
menominee
tribe
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
that
whether
they
--
that
is
as
members
of
the
shareholders
in
this
corporation
or
as
members
who
are
enrolled
on
this
final
roll,
i
can't
see
the
big
difference.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
statute
establishes
this
final
tribal
roll
just
about
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
let
me
say
the
court
of
claims
said
these
rights
are
pertaining
to
the
enrolled
members
of
the
tribe
that
is
those
whose
names
appear
on
this
roll
close
to
1954.
district
courts
in
the
klamath
termination
cases
held
expressly
that
the
right
is
limited
to
those
whose
name
appears
on
the
same
type
of
the
final
tribal
roll
and
not
to
otherwise
new
members
of
the
tribe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
--
this
is
of
course,
a
new
problem.
there
is
of
much
law
to
the
effect
that
tribal
rights
cannot
be
alienated
or
can
they
descend
to
individuals;
they
remain
in
the
tribe.
what
happens
when
the
tribe
itself
ceases
to
grow?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
have
thought
of
all
the
problems
presented
by
this
case;
those
problems
clearly
ones
for
the
future
need
not
be
reached
here
if
the
judgment
were
for
affirmance.
let
me
say
in
defense
of
--
by
small
briefs
in
this
case
that
we
have
--
it
is
true,
not
contributed
all
that
we
might
have.
on
the
other
hand,
we've
gone
to
somewhat
further
than
we
need
in
supporting
the
judgment
of
affirmance
of
no
liability
against
united
states.
we
do
point
out
in
our
brief
that
this
case
be
disposed
off
simply
by
affirmance
on
the
ground
that
nobody
really
--
any
longer
claims
the
judgment
against
the
united
states
whatever
the
reasons
may
be.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
does
disturb
me,
mr.
justice
black,
state
of
wisconsin
is
not
actively
participating.
i
assume
they
would
have
been
granted
leave
had
they
ask
for
it.
i
don't
know
that
they've
had
sufficient
knowledge
of
that
fact
and
it
might
be
better
for
the
case
and
for
the
court
if
that
argument
were
continued
and
wisconsin
was
expressly
invited
in
to
represent
the
opposing
view.
as
to
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
do
not.
i
do
see
the
problem
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
solution
which
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
that
it's
a
little
hard
to
reopen
the
case
at
the
‘63
term,
which
in
all
other
respects
is
moot.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
certainly
not
and
the
government
will
be
highly
agreeable
to
that
suggestion.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
inviting
the
states
of
texas
in
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
that
is
correct.
i
don't
know
whether
they
will
--
to
pursue
the
matter
now
or
--
but
it
--
let
me
just
briefly
state
our
position
on
the
merits.
the
--
as
i
said,
the
government's
main
contention
is
that
the
termination
act
had
no
effect
whatever
on
whatever
preexisting
treaty
rights
had
been
conferred.
in
the
first
place,
at
the
time
the
termination
act
was
passed,
congress
was
advised
by
officials
of
the
interior
department
that
treaty
rights
unlike
statutory
rights
would
survive
the
termination
act.
now,
it's
true
that
alternative
proposals
were
put
before
the
congress.
nevertheless,
it
is
likely
that
congress
or
the
congressional
committees
that
considered
this
did
take
the
advice
of
the
interior
officials
who
were
after
all
the
only
experts
before
them
on
this
question
of
indian
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
since
they're
off
reservation
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
(inaudible)
or
i'm
mispronouncing
it
and
nisqually
indian
cases
as
i'm
advised
there
would
be
in
readiness
for
argument
at
the
march
session.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
the
march
session,
i
believe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
--
i
shouldn't
--
the
clerk
can
advice
you
better
than
i
on
that
scope.
those
cases
presented
somewhat
a
different
but
related,
closely
related
issue
in
our
view
might
bear
on
the
decision
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
think
at
least
two,
in
two
respects,
the
rights
of
wis
--
the
state's
prerogative
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
on
this
reservation
is
clear.
one
is,
as
it's
now
conceded,
as
i
understand
it
by
the
petitioner,
insofar
as
this
wildlife
on
the
reservation
is
not
confined
to
the
reservation
but
is
migratory
or
is
otherwise
affects
the
game
beyond
the
borders
of
the
reservation,
clearly
in
the
interest
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
entire
state,
wisconsin
may
see
to
it
that
the
indians,
because
unrestricted
in
other
respects,
do
not
prejudice
the
rights
of
hunters,
commercial
or
otherwise
in
the
remaining
portion
of
the
state.
we
also
think
that
since
the
united
states
had
a
right
to
promulgate
and
enforce
regulations
to
preserve
the
asset
for
the
indians,
that
in
the
service
of
that
same
end,
wisconsin
may
now
make
applicable
some
regulations
of
a
purely
conservation
nature
which
would
tend
to
preserve
this
asset
for
the
benefit
of
indians.
now,
we
do
not
think
the
indians
can
me
made
to
share
this
resource,
which
is,
we
view
it
was
given
them
by
the
treaty
of
1854.
without
this,
it
cannot
be
made
to
allow
other
hunters
to
come
on
their
lands
even
navigable
rivers
or
other
places
which
a
normal
landowner
would
have
to
admit
strangers.
and
as
we've
--
as
i've
said
earlier,
we
do
not
think
that
wisconsin
can
tax
a
privilege
granted
by
treaty
and
there,
it
seems
to
us,
the
tully
case
which,
in
some
respects,
may
be
reargued
in
a
couple
of
months
are
--
is
clear
authority.
if
the
state
cannot
tax
the
privilege,
which
is
non-exclusive
off
the
reservation,
surely
it
cannot
tax
the
privilege
to
hunt,
to
fish
on
the
reservation
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
respect
to
taxation
and
sharing?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
clear
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
clear
what
they
do.
i
think
wisconsin's
position
however,
is
that
there
are
no
special
rules
with
respect
to
what
is
now
menominee
county
and
that
the
unions
have
no
claim
to
be
exempt
from
either
the
absolute
prohibition
on
how
to
--
now
there's
an
area
for
instance
where
it
seem
to
us
that
if
the
indians
were
given
a
right
to
hunt
and
at
the
time
it
included
something
mentioned
now,
“prohibited
quail”
that
while
you
may
be
able
to
regulate
and
hedge
in
that
right,
you
cannot
take
it
away
entirely
by
prohibiting
at
all
times,
at
all
places
hunting
of
quail.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
to
the
extent,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
i
really
don't
know
the
facts
of
the
menominee
reservation.
but
if
they
are,
as
i
think
they
are,
navigable
streams
or
lakes
within
that
very
large
area,
which
now
a
normal
private
landowner
would
control,
the
normal
rule
would
be
that
as
to
those
public
areas
that
is
navigable
streams
and
lakes,
the
landowner
would
be
required
to
admit
strangers
not
so
when
the
case
of
the
indians.
and
that
rule
and
that
difference
is
recognized
in
some
of
the
most
recent
cases,
the
kake
village,
case
70,
metlakatla
indian
case
in
alaska
decided
in
volumes
369
of
u.s.
reports.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
remain
the
problem
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
to
the
extent
that
the
process
they
had
in
the
opinion
gave
notice,
if
only
by
way
of
an
advisory
opinion
to
wisconsin
that
its
own
supreme
court's
decision
had
been
eroded
to
some
extent
assuming
the
court
were
to
file
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
unfortunately
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
clear,
mr.
justice
harlan
whether
there
had
been
some
give
and
take
on
both
sides
or
not.
i
am
clear
that
no
private
permanent
accommodation
has
been
made
between
the
condemning
parties
and
in
that
sense,
the
dispute
is
not
moot
but
it
may
be
that
during
this
period
of
litigation,
the
indians
have
restrained
themselves
and
so
have
the
wisconsin
state
authorities.
i
have
--
i'm
--
i
should
say
that
the
only
alternative
way
of
resolving
this
underlying
conflict
seems
to
be
by
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
wisconsin.
but
it
would
--
seem
a
hard
thing
to
do
to
ask
the
federal
district
court
to
confront
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
only
with
the
view
of
bringing
the
case
eventually
back
here
as
a
way
we
are
arguing
that
case,
in
which
the
sanapaw
case
in
which
certiorari
was
denied.
there
is
a
one
more
word
about
the
termination
act
and
our
view
that
it
does
not
affect
whatever
rights
were
granted.
of
course,
it's
not
to
be
likely
supposed
that
congress
would
repudiate
treaty
rights
once
solemn
be
given.
and
nor
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
congress
would
open
the
united
states
to
a
suit
for
damages
especially
at
the
very
time
when
it
was
trying
to
sever
the
financial
responsibility
of
the
united
states
toward
these
indians
and
to
have
abrogated
treaty
rights
at
least
raises
the
question
of
liability
for
the
government.
and
finally,
there's
nothing
anomalous
about
the
result
that
state
law
in
all
other
respects
applies
to
this
reservation.
the
reservation
is
no
longer
a
reservation
but
simply
menominee
county
and
that
nevertheless
certain
immunities
from
state
regulation
shall
persist
to
prevail.
that
is
the
expressed
provision
of
the
klamath
treaty,
of
the
klamath
termination
act
with
respect
to
fishing
rights.
the
district
court
has
held
it
to
be
true
with
respect
to
hunting
rights
in
the
case
of
the
klamath
indians
even
though
no
mention
is
made
with
respect
to
hunting
rights
in
the
termination
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry,
i've
misled
you,
mr.
justice
black.
it's
the
termination
act
with
the
klamath
passed
a
month
later
than
this
one
with
menominees,
which
says
in
so
many
words
that
this
termination
act
shall
not
affect
the
right,
the
tribal
rights
to
fishing.
that
has
been
held
to
--
has
been
construed
in
(inaudible)
to
have
the
effect
of
saying,
“it
shall
not
affect
the
tribal
rights
to
hunt
or
fish.”
but
more
than
the
point
perhaps
is
public
law
280
passed
in
1954
which
generally
conceded
to
the
states,
both
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
certain
named
so-called
“indian
country”
now
including
most
reservations
throughout
the
country.
and
yet
they
--
the
congressional
policy
was
not
to
allow
the
states
to
impinge
on
fishing
and
hunting
rights
granted
by
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
think
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
do
recognize
that
wisconsin,
for
whatever
reason
and
some
of
them
are
obvious,
has
chosen
to
exercise
that
power
whereas
the
federal
authorities
did
not
and
--
though
they
might
have.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
must
say
mr.
justice
fortas
that
our
failure
to
include
citations
on
that
point
is
not
the
lack
of
research
precisely
because
the
federal
authority
almost
never
exercised
what
we
view
as
this
latent
power
there
is
--
one
can't
go
at
it
by
finding
judicial
decisions
approving
certain
federal
regulations
and
then
saying
to
that
extent,
the
power
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
state.
there
is
just
very
little
law
on
what
federal
power
to
control
hunting
and
fishing
in
reservations
was.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
accustomed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that's
entirely
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
must
add
that
the
“termination
policies”
so-called
has
been
--
was
found
to
be
a
new
advanced
one.
there
were
five
to
six
of
these
termination
acts
and
in
most
instances
or
in
some
at
least
than
in
this
one
it
left
the
indians
very
much
disadvantaged
without
any
of
the
federal
help
that
they've
been
getting
in
the
past
and
not
a
corresponding
help
from
the
state
which,
perhaps,
had
been
helpful.
the
more
--
the
policy
today
is
to
follow
the
procedure
of
allowing
state
law,
civil
and
criminal
state
jurisdiction
to
attach
but
without
all
the
government
savoring
the
federal
link
at
least
until
such
time
as
--
if
ever
the
indians
are
able
economically
to
sustain
themselves
without
such
help.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
is
that
strain,
as
you
noticed,
mr.
justice
black,
but
in
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
to
the
distribution
of
the
tribal
property,
i
think
that
had
always
been
possible
under
the
allotment
acts.
of
course
that
didn't
apply
to
things
like
fishing
rights
which
--
just
in
here,
in
the
tribe
and
were
not
divisible,
didn't
go
with
an
allotment.
it
remained
in
the
members
as
an
indivisible
right
and
so
i
assume.
well
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
i
can
only
urge
that
the
court
do
affirm
the
judgment
below.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
judgment
below
might
be
affirmed
and
the
financial
interest
of
the
united
states
as
a
defendant
in
the
court
of
claims
might
be
fully
vindicated
simply
by
a
holding
that
the
termination
act
did
not
abrogate
whatever,
if
any,
treaty
rights
were
originally
guaranteed
to
these
indians
in
1854.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
say
that
the
court
in
one
sense
need
not
reach
the
question
whether
any
rights
were
conveyed
if
it
concludes
that
the
termination
act
did
not
affect
whatever
rights,
if
any
were
conveyed.
it
is,
however,
our
position
in
order
to
try
to
be
helpful
to
the
court
and
in
the
peculiar
situation
of
the
conflict
between
the
court
of
claims
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
and
the
dilemma
that
leaves
the
petitioners
in,
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
the
other
issues
and
i
tend
to
speak
to
them
now
in
--
in
chronological
order
that
is
first
as
to
our
view.
the
advisory,
as
it
may
be,
is
to
--
what
rights
were
originally
conveyed
were
originally
conveyed
in
1854.
many
thought
it
appropriate
distressed
that
the
outset
of
this
question
in
one
sense
is
not
necessary
to
reach.
in
our
view,
the
treaty
of
wolf
river
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
court
of
claims
has
decided
that
there
were
treaty
rights
and
if
this
court
should
decide
now
that
whatever
rights
were
granted
have
been
destroyed,
i
suppose
it
would
then
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
that
impose
by
the
colony
of
united
states
though
for
that
last
question,
i
should
think
there
ought
to
be
a
remand
since
the
court
of
claims
did
not
address
itself
to
that
viewing
the
termination
act
as
having
taken
nothing
away
from
the
indians.
in
our
view,
the
treaty
of
wolf
river,
when
it
ceded
these
lands
to
the
indians
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held,
in
all
the
circumstances
which
have
been
fully
recited
by
the
petitioners
may
fairly
be
read
to
have
intended
to
give
to
these
indians
the
same
rights
that
they
would
have
had
in
this
land
and
once
did
have
in
this
land
if
it
had
always
been
theirs.
that
is
as
though
this
provision
had
read
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held,
that
is
to
say
with
the
right
to
take
the
wildlife
thereof.
in
other
words,
we
view
the
so-called
hunting
and
fishing
rights
as
an
aspect
of
the
right
to
own
or
possess
these
lands.
we
view
it
as
tied
to
the
right
to
own
or
posses
these
lands.
we
view
it
as
ending
when
the
ownership
or
possession
of
the
land
is
no
longer
in
the
tribe.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
that
the
right
granted,
however,
pertinent
to
the
land
it
may
be,
however,
tied
to
the
land
it
may
be
is
very
much
more
than
a
normal
landowner's
right
with
respect
to
fishing
and
hunting
on
its
own
land.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
a
right
unlike
the
privilege
susceptible
of
being
wholly
or
partly
destroyed
which
an
ordinary
landowner
has
with
respect
to
hunting
and
fishing
on
his
lands.
the
state
can
forbid
him
from
taking
the
wildlife
of
his
own
land
and
conservation
laws
do
often
do
precisely
that
or
they
can
limit
it.
also,
we
suppose
that
this
right
have
been
granted
by
the
united
states
or
it
is
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
in
a
federal
treaty
cannot
be
taxed
by
the
state.
in
that
respect
also,
there
is
something
more
than
a
normal
landowner's
right
with
respect
to
game
and
fish
on
his
land.
and
finally,
to
the
extent
that
the
normal
landowner
would
not
be
able
to
exclude
others
from
these
lands
at
least
those
lands
which
border
on
navigable
rivers
or
the
rivers
themselves,
these
indians
have
a
special
right
because
they
have
an
exclusive
right
to
exclude
all
others
and
cannot
be
made
to
share
their
resource
with
the
other
citizens
of
the
state.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
though
i
will
ultimately
reach
the
question
whether
such
a
conveyance
has
taken
place
here
and
concluded
it
has
not
that
in
--
one
can
look
at
it
in
several
ways
but
it
seems
to
loss
the
technical
way
in
which
to
view
it
perhaps
is
to
be
with
the
cooperation,
that's
not
the
corporation
as
the
fee
owner
of
those
lands
which
have
not
been
puzzled
out
as
homesteads
and
the
tribe
is
the
beneficial
owner,
in
other
words,
cooperation
is
the
substitute
for
the
united
states
trustee
in
the
tribe
as
always
remains
the
beneficial
owner
which
is
what
it
always
was.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
so
long
as
the
membership
in
the
stock
corporation
is
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
under
some
restrictions
and
those
very
restrictions
indicate
to
some
extent
that
this
is
a
kind
of
trusteeship
arrangement.
we
do
not
view
the
right
as
continuing
to
appertain
to
those
small
parts
of
land
which
have
been
alienated
by
the
corporation
to
individual
aliens
because
this
is
a
tribal
right
which
as
we
view
it
appertains
only
to
the
tribal
property
and
must
be
exercised
on
that
land
exclusively.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
it
matters
who
the
stockholders
of
the
nominal
corporation
are
so
long
as
the
tribe
remains
the
beneficial
owner.
but
once
the
new
stockholder
exercises
his
option
to
take
a
plot
of
land
for
his
stock
then
that
plot
of
land
is
no
longer
in
any
sense
subject
to
this
right
of
the
tribe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
i
understand
it
and
that's
only
from
what
was
said
here
today
are
less
than
10%
of
the
total
former
reservation
lands
have
been
puzzled
out
in
what
i
take
to
be
small
homesteads
to
individual
indians.
each
member
of
the
corporation
has
an
option
as
i
understand
it
to
turn
in
a
bond
which
he
receives
for
a
puzzle
land
and
some
have
done
so.
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
mentioned
a
figure
of
500
of
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that's
one
way
of
looking
at
mr.
justice
fortas.
it's
also
true
that
the
other
members
of
the
tribe
can
no
longer
freely
go
on
what
is
now
is
brought
a
homestead
and
of
course
he
retains
whatever
rights
a
normal
land
owner
would
have
with
respect
to
his
plot
of
land
and
he
remains
able
to
hunt
and
fish
on
the
communal
property.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it
as
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
sure
that
the
petitioner
and
we
are
at
one
on
this
question
but
what
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
we
--
as
we
view
it
here,
the
tribe
and
of
course
exercised
by
the
members
of
the
tribe
owns
or
holds
a
right,
a
special
federally
guaranteed
nontaxable
exclusive
right
to
hunt
and
fish
the
wildlife
of
these
lands
as
it
always
did
when
it
was
a
reservation
and
as
usual
with
respect
to
all
reservations,
here
that
right
survives
in
those
lands
which
remain
communal
so
long
as
the
tribe
remains
an
entity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
for
the
--
mr.
justice
fortas
--
for
the
corporation
is
no
more
than
any
other
trustee
whether
it
consist
of
indians
or
non-indians,
whether
it's
the
united
states
or
whether
it's
the
state
of
wisconsin.
it
is
simply
the
shell
which
holds
this
land
in
trust
as
it
were
for
the
tribe
and
all
the
members
thereof,
those
who
have
taken
homestead
and
those
who
have
not.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry.
i
misled
your
honor.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
no
longer
appertain
to
this
plot
which
had
been
alienated
to
the
individual
indian
but
the
individual
indian
by
exercising
his
option
to
take
the
plot
does
not
cease
to
be
a
member
o
the
tribe
and
as
a
member
of
the
tribe,
he
is
entitled
to
continue
to
hunt
and
fish
as
he
always
was
on
that
portion
of
the
former
reservation
which
remains
communally-owned.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
think
that
was
the
result
mr.
justice
white.
and
that
perhaps
points
up
the
fact
that
we
are
not
talking
about
a
right
which
we
now
view
would
last
for
a
time
in
memorial.
it
is
to
be
anticipated
that
gradually
and
at
their
own
chosen
pace,
the
indians
will
cease
to
function
as
the
tribe,
will
cease
to
be
eligible
for
membership
in
the
tribe,
will
alienate
their
lands
and
that
this
communal
property
would
cease
to
be
a
hunting
preserved
for
the
menominees
but
so
long
as
they
have
chosen
to
own
the
property
in
common
or
be
it
now
through
a
corporation
rather
than
as
beneficiaries
of
the
united
states.
and
so
long
as
they
do,
as
they
have
indicated
that
they
wish
to
remain
a
tribe
and
their
right
to
remain
a
tribe
doesn't
depend
on
the
secretary
of
the
interior
of
the
united
states.
the
tribe
existed
before
the
united
states
took
any
notice
of
them
and
can
survive
long
after
the
united
states
ceases
to
have
supervision
over
them.
their
status
as
a
tribe
does
not
depend
upon
their
status
as
wards
of
the
government,
they're
entitled
to
be
a
tribe
as
all
the
authority
is
recognized,
as
long
as
to
choose,
that
is
not
a
question
for
the
government
to
decide
further.
the
effect
of
the
termination
act
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
have
not
conceived
of
it
as
appertaining
to
anyone
other
than
american
indians.
i
suppose
other
organizations
do
depend
on
the
tolerance
of
state
laws
whereas
it
seems
to
me
that
the
continuance
of
the
menominee
tribe
does
not
depend
upon
the
cooperation
of
wisconsin
because
of
their
existence
as
a
community
of
course
long
antedates
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
i
assume
they're
citizens
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
as
they
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
as
all
they've
been
so
since
1924.
now,
to
sum
up
the
nature
of
the
right,
it
seems
to
us
therefore
to
be
a
property
right
not
a
sovereignty
right,
not
a
political
right.
the
consequence
of
that
is
that
we
do
not
view
it
as
a
right
to
be
immune
from
all
outside
regulation
but
as
because
of
the
nature
of
the
property
right
and
because
the
property
right
is
destructible
by
too
much
regulation,
it
of
course
as
every
right
does
carries
with
it
certain
immunities.
we
test
the
degree
of
the
immunity
from
regulation
of
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
by
looking
to
that
immunity
which
is
a
legal
matter
not
as
practical
matter,
as
a
legal
matter,
the
tribe
enjoyed
during
the
hundred
years
when
the
united
states
government
rather
than
the
state
of
wisconsin
had
power
to
regulate
the
hunting
and
fishing
on
this
reservation.
because
the
tribe
owns
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
exclusively,
because
it
has
a
right
to
exclude
all
others,
because
it
has
the
right
to
do
so
free
without
taxation,
no
regulation
by
the
federal
or
state
government
could
destroy
this
right
of
ownership
by
in
effect
making
the
indians
share
their
resource
with
others
whether
under
the
name
of
conservation
or
by
allowing
others
to
trespass
on
their
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
without
compensation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
intended
to
take
away
its
right
is
the
next
point
that
i
invest
myself
to.
for
the
moment,
i'm
simply
trying
to
define
what
right
it
is
that
we're
talking
about
having
survived
as
we
will
conclude
that
it
did
survive
on
the
effect
of
that
determination
i
think.
as
i
say,
the
federal
government
as
guardian
of
the
indians
had
certain
rights
of
regulation
with
respect
to
tribal
property
including
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
those
rights
were
on
the
one
hand
to
conserve
the
resource
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
and
not
to
make
them
share
it
with
others,
to
apportion
it
fairly
among
the
members
of
the
tribe
and
to
conserve
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
future
members
of
the
tribe.
and
likewise,
the
federal
government
had
the
duty
and
the
power
to
protect
others
against
destruction
by
indians
of
the
resource
that
was
not
wholly
theirs
and
so
as
to
migratory
fish
or
fowl,
the
united
states
could
and
we
think
that
the
state
can,
make
sure
that
the
indians
do
not
take
more
than
their
fair
share
of
this
migratory
resource
but
as
to
that
resource
which
is
native
to
the
reservation,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
only
regulation
that
is
proper
is
a
regulation
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
they
well
be
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
no
interest
in
regulating
the
game
on
--
in
menominee
county
for
the
benefit
of
indians
in
which
event,
it
is
of
course
free
to
let
the
indians
regulate
it
themselves.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
there
is
state
power
to
condemn
a
federal
right
--
a
right
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
let
me
say
that
this
does
not
present
an
unusual
or
difficult
problem
for
the
state
of
wisconsin.
every
state
which
has
a
reservation
within
it
is
by
well
settled
law
bound
from
applying
its
fishing
within
that
reservation
and
that
includes
all
those
states
which
otherwise
have
full
jurisdiction
within
the
reservation
civil
and
criminal
public
law
280
which
is
passed
of
the
very
same
session
is
that
this
law
expressly
forbids
that
states
otherwise
may
apply
the
criminal
and
civil
laws
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing.
this
is
not
an
unusual
difficult
problem
which
wisconsin
alone
is
faced
with.
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968
in
title
iv
which
pertains
to
indians
and
which
extends
in
effect
public
law
282,
all
indians
throughout
the
country
again
expressly
reserves
the
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
when
guaranteed
by
federal
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
for
rather
important
point
that
the
termination
act
have
the
effect
of
substituting
whatever
power
of
regulation
there
ever
was
from
the
federal
government
to
the
state
government.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
far
as
the
state
power
to
regulate
within
what
was
formerly
a
reservation
which
is
now
being
terminated,
there
is
only
one
litigated
group
of
cases
other
than
this
one
as
far
as
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
regulate
within
the
reservation
are
--
the
federal
government
has
almost
never
attempted
to
exercise
any
power
whatever
we
maybe
straining
when
we--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
agree.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice
fortas.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
federal
right
which
must
be
respected
by
the
united
states
short
of
the
paying
compensation
for
the
taking
of
it
and
of
course
must
be
respected
by
the
states
and
to
the
extent
that
that
right
survives
termination.
it
cannot
be
impinged
upon
now
by
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
state
of
wisconsin
now
has
by
virtue
of
the
termination
act
and
even
without
the
termination
act
by
virtue
of
the
removal
of
the
federal
fence
around
these
lands,
the
state
has
power
to
bring
its
law
into
the
reservation
and
to
do
all
regulation
with
respect
to
this
hunting
and
fishing
rights
short
of
interfering
with
exercising
of
rights.
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
i
understand
the
nature
of
a
right,
it
carries
with
it
an
immunity
from
interference
and
all
i'm
saying
that
is
--
that
since
the
right
to
granted
here
is
an
exclusive
ownership
of
this
resource,
nothing
can
be
done
which
takes
away
from
the
indians
that
exclusive
ownership.
that
does
not
however
prevent
an
apportionment
of
the
asset
among
the
tribe
or
a
preservation
of
the
asset
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
and
its
future
members.
that
maybe
a
very
small
thing
to
concede
to
wisconsin
and
it
may
well
be
that
wisconsin
will
determine
that
it
doesn't
care
about
helping
the
indians.
it
rather
let
them
help
themselves.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
saying
that
precisely
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
do
say
that
the
indians
have
something
special
which
a
normal
landowner
does
not
have
which
is
a
right
as
opposed
to
a
mere
tolerance
of
privilege
granted
by
the
state
or
federal
treaty
right
to
take
the
wildlife
of
their
reservation.
that
is
an
unusual
and
extraordinary
right.
it
is
a
power
that
is
well
recognized
with
the
indian
right.
it
is
a
right
which
it
seems
to
us
goes
with
indian
tenure.
it
does
not
go
with
the
white
man's
tenure
of
property
and
it
is
precisely
that
which
we
cannot
conceive
that
the
congress
intended
to
abrogate
merely
because
it
allowed
wisconsin's
laws
in
other
respects
to
take
hold
on
these
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
my
first
answer
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
it
does
differ
and
the
reason
it
does
differ
is
because
the
indian
land
tenure
carries
with
it
a
right,
an
absolute
right,
a
exclusive
right,
an
unusual
right,
an
extraordinary
right
to
take
the
wildlife
which
is
found
on
that
land.
a
right
which
no
private
landowner
any
of
the
states
i
know
of,
has
except
by
tolerance
or
by
grant
from
the
state.
here,
whether
the
state
likes
it
or
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
wholly
unregulated
mr.
justice
stewart
because
as
i
said,
it
can
be
regulated
for
their
own
benefit,
and
also
and
this
maybe
quite
involved
in
the
case
of
the
menominee
reservation
to
the
extent
that
this
resource
is
not
wholly
native
to
the
reservation.
there's
a
salmon
stream
that
begins
there
and
--
but
does
go
on
into
the
next
county.
it
seems
to
us
perfectly
clear
that
the
federal
government
could
have
and
perhaps
should
have
and
that
the
state
now
can
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
as
the
new
guardian
but
simply
as
exercising
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
sovereign
power
of
government
against
what
was
never
an
immunity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
a
case
mr.
justice
douglas
which
says
it
does
not
hold
that
the
federal
government
did
have
a
right
to
regulate
the
portion
of
the
stream
that
was
within
the
reservation.
now,
i
know
that
mason
against
sams
is
the
opposite.
that's
a
district
court
opinion
in
1905
and
it
somewhat
baffles
me
why
it's
been
uh
accepted
as
the
law
ever
since
but
without
appeal
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
did
in
that
case.
that
was
the
quinault
reservation
and
it
purported
to
say
how
many
nets
could
be
established
at
what
locations
and
then
provided
further
that
since
they
have
a
few
locations
and
only
a
few
indians
who
would
benefit
from
it,
the
--
those
who
hold
the
nets
must
pay
a
fee
which
was
turned
over
to
the
tribe
and
then
distributed
evenly
among
members.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
rationale
of
the
decision
maybe
that
secretary
of
the
interior
without
congressional
authorization
had
no
right
to
do
this.
of
course,
as
your
honor
well
knows,
the
government
did
and
always
has
control
timber
and
grazing
operations
on
reservations
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
to
preserve
the
asset
and
to
distribute
it
evenly.
there
is
no
distinction
in
principle
why
the
same
cannot
be
true
of
fishing
wildlife.
and
in
re
blackbird
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
says
that
this
can
be
done,
but
the
state
cannot
do
what
the
federal
government
can.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
question
but
the
congress
has
constitutional
power
to
abrogate
any
treaty
with
indians.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
more
--
the
more
recent
cases
indicate
quite
clearly
that
there
would
be
an
obligation
of
paying
compensation
if
what
have
been
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
there
is
a
forum
--
if
there
is
a
jurisdictional
act
which
permits
it
and
i
didn't
get
that
since
1946.
there
has
been
such
a
forum.
prior
to
that
there
was
no
and
except
for
a
special
jurisdictional
acts
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
shoshone
case.
okay,
this
very
case
of
course,
the
court
of
claims
took
the
view
that
if
i'm
talking
about
property
rights
and
we
have
to
assume
that
what
we
are
speaking
of
here
is
an
aspect
of
--
well
not
all
--
not
all
treaty
guarantees
maybe
compensable
but
property
rights
are
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
created
by
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
which
is
what
we
say
this
is,
what
seem
compensable.
i
must
add
that
in
this
case,
there
is
an
argument
which
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
make
here
now
that
the
indians
consented
to
the
abrogation
of
the
treaty
by
agreeing
to
termination.
that
question,
however,
has
embarrassments
because
the
indians
were
pretty
much
told
you
won't
get
your
$9
million
unless
you
agree
with
the
termination.
and
furthermore,
they
may
have
be
said
to
have
agreed
to
it
on
condition
that
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
preserved
as
their
attorney
as
the
congressional
committee's
to
do
but
i
cannot
say
that
it
would
automatically
follow.
that
would
be
a
question
on
remand
as
to
whether
liability
will
be
viewed
in
this
case
if
it
were
concluded
to
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
had
been
taken
away.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice.
it's
sighted
in
the
petitioners
brief.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
case
in
this
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
rough,
that
is
if
with
the
caveat
i
mentioned
about
the
consent
of
the
taking
by
agreeing
to
termination.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
with
the
further
caveat
that
the
court
would
of
course
have
to
find
that
we
would
urge
the
court
so
find
despite
our
self-interest,
there
was
at
the
treaty
property
right
involved
and
secondly
that
there
now
is
a
tribe
who
can
continue
to
enjoy
the
right
and
therefore
a
proper
plaintiff
could
bring
this
action
in
the
court
of
claims.
let
me
say
a
word
about
what
is
most
central
to
this
case
which
is
the
effect
of
the
termination
act.
i
will
simply
summarize
the
reasons,
most
of
which
have
already
been
spoken
here,
why
in
our
view,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
termination
act
have
no
intent
to
abrogate
whatever
hunting
and
fishing
rights
had
been
granted
by
the
treaty
of
1854.
in
the
first
place,
of
course,
it
is
against
the
normal
presumption
that
the
congress
would
repudiate
the
solemn
treaty
it
had
made
with
the
indians
and
especially
that
it
would
do
so,
we're
in
complete
silence
and
without
making
any
provision
for
adequate
compensation
for
the
taking
of
that
right.
we
surely
know
the
presumption
that
congress
was
not
about
such
unfortunate
business.
now
the
--
it
is
true
that
the
treaty
--
that
the
termination
act
says
that
federal
law
shall
no
longer
apply
and
that
state
laws
shall
apply.
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
language
is
uniform
in
the
ten
termination
acts.
this
was
the
first
termination
act.
it
was
very
badly
written
and
there
are
more
careful
provisions
when
inserted.
the
same
language
appears
in
the
klamath
termination
act
where
it
has
been
held
that
first,
the
fishing
rights
which
are
expressly
preserved
were
of
course
not
taken
but
also
the
hunting
rights
which
are
nowhere
mentioned
is
preserved
will
also
survive
termination.
now,
relevant
to
the
particular
legislative
history
of
this
act
is
the
statement
of
two
witnesses
from
the
interior
department,
one
of
them
is
the
assistant
secretary
who
were
the
drafters
of
this
law
and
who
assured
the
committee
that
the
termination
act
even
though
it
did
not
expressly
preserved
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
not
touch
it.
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
congressional
committees
and
the
congress
as
a
whole
listen
to
that
advise
and
felt
that
they
were
not
by
this
act
interfering
with
whatever
hunting
and
fishing
to
menominees
had
previously
enjoyed.
this
is
further
indicated
by
the
fact
that
at
the
same
con
--
at
the
same
congress,
at
the
same
session,
the
congress
when
generally
providing
for
the
application
of
state
laws
within
indian
country
had
said,
"all
criminal
laws
shall
apply.
all
civil
laws
shall
apply
if
the
state
so
chooses
but
they
shall
not
have
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
guaranteed
by
the
treaty
with
the
united
state."
the
congress
will
be
doing
that
on
one
hand
and
here
to
be
letting
the
menominee
hunting
and
fishing
rights
go
by
the
board
in
silence
seems
they're
all
are
extraordinary
things
to
assume.
i
finally,
as
i
think
mr.
justice
white
was
pointing
out
a
moment
ago,
the
termination
act
itself
says,
that
that
the
plan
which
is
to
be
submitted
by
the
indians
shall
contain
provision
for
the
wildlife,
safety
and
protection
of
the
wildlife
and
fish.
now,
that
would
seem
wholly
unnecessary
if
the
state
fishing
game
laws
were
going
to
be
fully
applicable.
why
should
the
indians
be
making
provision
to
preserve
this
asset
of
theirs?
and
finally,
the
exposure
of
the
government
to
monetary
damages,
if
treaty
rights
were
being
taken
or
would
suggest
that
the
congress
did
not
mean
to
produce
that
result
at
the
very
time
when
it
was
concerned
about
relieving
the
government
of
its
financial
obligation
to
the
indians
resulting
from
the
various
services
which
had
been
provided
in
the
past.
there
is
nothing
inherently
inconsistent
about
termination
of
federal
supervision
and
continuance
of
treaty
rights
on
the
one
hand
and
survival
of
the
tribe
on
the
other
hand.
what
was
terminated
were
both
powers
and
the
duties
of
the
united
states
government
vis-à-vis
the
indians.
but
the
indians'
existence
as
a
tribe
does
not
--
it
has
depended
on
the
united
states
as
their
guardian.
and
these
treaty
rights
of
course
can
exist,
can
be
respected
by
the
state
and
can
be
enforced
by
the
federal
government
if
necessary
without
there
being
any
federal
guardianship
over
these
indians
just
as
the
off
reservation
treaty
rights
which
were
discussed
in
the
case
last
session,
exists
quite
independently
of
any
federal
supervision
over
those
indians
or
for
that
matter
any
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
accustomed
hunting
and
fishing
places.
the
federal
treaty
right
can
survive
without
federal
guardianship.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
must
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
answer
this
way
mr.
justice
white.
there
are
strong
indications
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
very
letter
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
the
chairman
of
the
congressional
committee,
explaining
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
had
refused
to
acquiesce
or
to
favorably
recommend
the
bill
which
had
been
introduced
by
congressman
laird
to
divide
this
fund
of
$9
million
in
to
and
in
less
the
menominee's
agreed
to
the
termination
of
federal
supervision
and
--
but
congressman
laird
accused
to
the
committee
of
having
a
force
termination
on
the
indians.
there
is
certainly
a
question
as
to
whether
they're
consent
which
they
didn't
make
what's
free
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
the
congress
view
that
it
wished
to
have
the
consent
of
the
indians.
whether
there
would
have
been
a
termination
in
the
absence
of
the
consent
of
the
indians,
i
don't
know.
the
consent,
however,
maybe
have
been
obtained
by
saying,
"you'll
get
your
money
if
you
agree
to
this."
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
when
i
take
it
as
a
--
as
a
constitutional
matter,
a
termination
would
not
have
required
to
consent
the
indian
and
that
the
congress
would
have
been
free
to
proceed
ahead.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
true,
if
and
not
only
if
they
were
taking
anything
in
way
of
the
property
right
away
which
show
we
strongly
urge
was
not
the
case.
now,
one
word
about
the
future
as
i've
already
said,
we
view
these
rights
as
continuing
in
the
tribe
which
itself
continues.
indians
have
by
various
acts
indicated
their
desire
to
remain
a
tribe.
they
have
by
preserving
most
of
their
reservation
lands
as
a
whole
indicated
their
wish
to
continue
to
live
communally
and
to
own
their
land
communally
whether
that's
through
a
corporation
or
otherwise
for
all
practical
purposes
as
is
the
same
way
of
life
they
live
as
before.
they
have
only
recently,
between
the
two
arguments
in
this
case,
adopted
new
rules
for
membership.
they
have
opened
the
rule
which
it
seems
to
us
they
have
the
right
to
do.
but
they
have
followed
the
secretary
of
interior's
rules
as
to
what
constitutes
a
bona
fide
member
which
rules
seem
reasonable
unlike
mr.
justice
douglas'
indians,
they
can
find
their
membership
to
those
of
the
quarter
blood
and
require
that
if
his
one
parent
was
a
resident
to
the
reservation
at
the
time
of
birth,
and
as
i
said
before
these
conditions
are
not
likely
to
last
forever,
so
there
should
be
no
fear
that
this
enclave
will
last
in
perpetuity
and
yet
these
are
very
necessary
and
very
valuable
rights
would
be
allowed
to
be
preserved
to
the
indians
for
all
these
inter
period.
we
urge
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
