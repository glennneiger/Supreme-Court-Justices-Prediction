justice
potter
stewart
but
when
did
the
state
know,
the
government's
changed
its
position?
when
did
that
first
appear,
after
the
court
of
claims
position,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
it's
your
right
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
been
extinguished?
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
wasn't
a
party
in
the
court
of
claims
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose,
mr.
hobbs,
what
would
resolve
all
this
is
that
we
vacated
our
denial
--
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
set
this
thing
down
for
reargument
and
have
both
cases
argued.
and
that's
the
real
way
that
resolves
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
that
wisconsin
case
involved
criminal
convictions,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
all,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
that's
their
long
sense
moot,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
fines
had
been
paid?
that
deer
have
been
consumed?
justice
potter
stewart
were
you
saying
that
it's
an
eastern
hunter
state
around
hayward
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
green
bay.
justice
potter
stewart
further
south.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that
in
our
record?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
wisconsin
formed
a
new
county
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
this
county
consist
of
anything
else
except
the
former
reservation?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
whole
90%
--
more
than
90%
of
the
whole
county
is
owned
by
this
corporation?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
claims
isn't
--
there's
no
question
of
the
full
face
of
credit
in
that
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
--
then
would
hunting
and
fishing
rights
exist
in
that
state
of
affairs
that
--
that
--
that
--
that
everybody
does
now?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
the
counsel,
mr.
attorney
general,
emphasized
quite
clearly
that
he
was
--
was
not
--
that
he
was
not
claiming
that
the
--
that
the
--
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
now
are
owned
by
this
non-profit
wisconsin
corporation
at
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
--but
rather
by
a
tribe
--
by
a
tribe,
at
the
tribe.
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
the
tribe
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
enjoyed
by
the
members
of
the
tribe.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
if
the
court
decided
the
other
way,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
us
to
reach
either
if
we
held
that
the
termination
act
did
destroy
treaty
rights
if
any
and
then
--
and
the
court
of
claims
decide
whether
there
were
any
and
if
so,
what
they
were
and
finally,
what
was
their
value.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
in
your
view
a
right
to
procure
hereto
american
indians
or
the
other
people
have
--
in
the
united
states
have
a
similar
right
to
form
and
organize
a
tribe
and
have
that
kind
of
an
organization.
justice
potter
stewart
these
people
--
are
these
people
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
wisconsin?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
saying
that
either
the
state
or
the
federal
government
has
power
to
take
that
away?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
that's
what
these
people
sued
for
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
compensation.
justice
potter
stewart
the
right
to
do
so
unregulated
by
any
government,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
as
successor
to
the
--
what
the
federal
government
used
to
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
sovereign
power
of
government.
justice
potter
stewart
do
--
who
hunted
the
deer
and
trapped
the
beaver?
justice
potter
stewart
outsiders.
justice
potter
stewart
well
couldn't
it
--
couldn't
they
have
been
kept
off
the
land
by
the
owners
of
the
land?
justice
potter
stewart
we
were
told
by
the
attorney
general
within
wisconsin
--
under
that
i
gather
the
trespass
laws
of
wisconsin
if
i
don't
want
you
to
hunt
in
my
land,
i'd
keep
you
off.
or
i
can
keep
you
off
if
you
just
want
to
use
my
land
as
an
access
route
to
navigable
streams,
as
i
understood
the
attorney
general?
justice
potter
stewart
so
by
agreement
of
the
owner
of
the
land?
justice
potter
stewart
but
when
did
the
state
know,
the

changed
