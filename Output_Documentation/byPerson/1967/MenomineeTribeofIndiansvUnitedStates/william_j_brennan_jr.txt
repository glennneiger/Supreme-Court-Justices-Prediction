justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
the
ruled
on
something
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
hobbs
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
there
be
anything
of
this
--
in
it,
mr.
hobbs
initially
when
you
fought
this
out
in
the
wisconsin
court,
you
had
hoped
to
vindicate
the
position
that
your
rights
survived
the
termination
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
claiborne,
i
noticed
in
that
advice
you
gave
us
on
1963,
you
went
rather
far,
didn't
you?
the
effect
of
the
1954
act
we
submit
was
to
terminate
the
resolution
status
of
menominee
land
and
to
subject
hunting
rights
on
those
lands
in
the
same
state
conservation
regulations,
which
would
apply
to
indian
hunting
rights
of
any
outside
a
reservation,
now
is
it
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
as
the
matter
of
wisconsin.
can
i
go
to
wisconsin
and
cross
farmer's
pasture
to
get
to
a
creek
to
fish?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
certainly
not
true
in
many
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
i
--
is
it
consistently
suggestive
--
i
understood
your
argument
that
united
states
should
compensate
to
the
damages
and
yet
that
what
they
got
was
attached
to
the
land
and
once
they
disposed
off
the
land,
the
right
disappeared.
it
is
consistent
on
that
argument
to
suggest
that
united
states
is
still
liable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
no.
what
--
what
i
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this.
obviously,
when
the
termination
act
got
the
indians
out
from
under
the
federal
government's
weighing,
they
were
no
longer
words,
they
are
now
titled
to
take
property
and
sell
it,
dispose
of
it,
self
government,
they
got
all
these
things,
didn't
they,
as
consequences
of
the
termination
act.
well,
i
thought
you
still
argue
that
nevertheless
as
to
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
the
in
--
the
federal
government
ought
to
compensate
the
indians,
although
you
suggest
under
the
treaty
itself,
the
--
those
rights
attached
only
to
the
land
and
since
the
indians
have
now
availed
themselves
of
what
they
got
under
the
termination
act,
that
is
the
right
to
dispose
of
these
lands
and
they
have
disposed
of
them,
that
that
in
and
of
itself
would
have
terminated
the
right.
now,
why
does
the
federal
government
still
owe
them
compensation?
that's
what
i
don't
quite
follow.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
of
the
land
in
fact
has
been
exposed
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
could
--
that
would
extinguish
this
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
what
this
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
case
in
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see.
then
that
--
does
this
all
add
up
mr.
claiborne
that
the
government's
position
is
that
yes,
it
would
be
compensable
if
it
had
been
taken
but
it
wasn't
taken
by
the
termination
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
only
purpose
of
the
bag
limit
was
to
conserve
the
wildlife
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i

that's
your
position.
