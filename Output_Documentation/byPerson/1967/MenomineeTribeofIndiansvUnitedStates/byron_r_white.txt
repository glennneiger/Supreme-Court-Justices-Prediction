justice
byron
r.
white
and
now,
the
government
agrees
with
your
position
at
least
as
to
the
termination
act
did
not
extinguish,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
hasn't
always
been
the
government's
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
now
is
no
one
in
this
case
before
us
arguing
the
side
about
the
termination?
justice
byron
r.
white
extinguishment
through
the
termination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
its
not
--
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
isn't
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
different
in
that
so
to
speak,
the
federal
government
would
permit
to
stay
the
wisconsin
to
put
the
very
regulation
on
these
hunting
rights
that
were
involved
in
this
case
and
would
say
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
unable
to
keep
people
from
hunting
with
a
light
at
night
on
this
reservation
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
carrying
a
gun
in
a
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
that's
rather
a
big
difference
between
you,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
the
judgment
that
we're
reviewing
because
that
the
--
because
in
any
event,
apparently
nobody
here
objects
to
this
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
we're
reviewing
judgments
instead
of
opinions,
why
--
there
is
really
no
adverse
interest
here,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
both
want
us
to
do
what,
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
affirm
it,
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
government
disagree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
if
you're
wrong,
if
the
court
of
the
claims
was
wrong,
we
have
to
reverse.
does
the
government
deny
your
right
to
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
the
government's
argument
is
not
the
termination
act
expose
these
lands
to
any
different
kind
of
regulation
than
they
were
subject
to
before.
it's
just
they
were
just
subject
to
regulation
at
the
hands
of
different
governmental
entity.
they
would
--
they're
argument
is
that
--
is
in
terms
to
defining
what
the
treaty
rights
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
termination
act
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
therefore,
no
compensation.
i
mean,
you
never
lost
--
you've
never
lost
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
--
let's
assume
that
you
can't
hunt
and
fish
with
complete
freedom
that
you
are
subject
to
the
kind
of
limited
regulation
the
government
seems
to
think
you're
subject
to,
would
you
then
say
that
you're
entitled
to
some
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
didn't
you
ask
for
reversal
up
here
or
why
don't
you
urge
reversal
now
no
matter
what
your
previous
position
has
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
wisconsin
says
you
don't
have
them
and
the
court
of
claims
isn't
going
to
change
the
wisconsin
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
if
a
--
their
hunting
or
fishing
activity
a
commercial,
you
said
they
eat
what
they
caught
but
do
they
have
a
surplus
that
they
sell
or
what
else
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
among
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
among
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
a
publicly
commercial
venture,
any
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hobbs,
what
about
the
additional
points
of
this
supplemental
memo
that's
distributed
to
us
only
this
morning
by
the
state
of
wisconsin?
that
even
if
the
court
of
claims
is
right
and
you
were
wrong
and
the
government
is
right,
that
these
rights
survived
the
termination
act
that
nevertheless
that
presently
a
--
no
members
of
the
menominee
tribe
who
could
exercise
those
rights
because
the
roads,
a
fire
road
travel
roads
were
closed
by
the
secretary
of
interior
at
sometime,
don't
say
when.
what
about
that
point?
is
that
any
--
would
we
have
to
decide
that
even
if
we
affirm?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
rather
important
detail.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
determines
who
gets
on
the
roll?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
corporation
which
holds
titles
to
this
land,
just
a
holding
entity,
is
that
all
this
or
is
that
--
is
its
governing
board
also
the
governing
board
for
the
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
“outsiders”
what
do
you
mean
“outsider”?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
their
business
venture?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
do
you
claim
are
entitled
to
hunting
rights,
just
the
members
of
the
menominee
tribe
or
is
it
the
corporation
which
or
is
it
a
personal
thing
or
does
it
attach
to
the
land
and
therefore
available
to
whoever
owns
the
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
the
property
belongs
to
the
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
certainly
just
relates
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
statute
says
that
interest
shall
be
alienable
in
accordance
to
such
regulations
may
be
adopted
by
the
tribe.
did
they
ever
adopt
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
a
membership
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
before
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
united
states
agrees
with
you
on
that?
what's
the
source
of
their
supposed
power
to
put
some
sort
of
minimal
regulations
on
hunting
and
fishing
rights
which
they
concede
these
indians
obtained
under
this
treaty?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
the
united
states'
position,
do
you
think
they
--
don't
you
think
that
they
seem
to
--
since
united
states
had
some
power
over
these
indian
hunting
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean.
so
they
claim
that
the
hunting
rights
were
held
by
them
as
trustee
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
your
petition
for
certiorari
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
loss
out
and
you
ask
this
court
to
say
or
to
review
that
position
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
to
say
it
was
wrong
and
we
refused
to
review
the
decision
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
so
then,
if
that
was
the
end
of
the
line
and
your
claim
to
the
rights
--
then
you're
only
remedy
thereafter
was
for
compensation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
correct?
so
you
went
into
the
court
of
claims
and
asked
for
compensation
on
the
premise
that
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
right
or
wrong
that
judgment
was
final
since
we
have
refused
to
review
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
to
your
other
amazement,
the
court
of
claims
says
that
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
was
wrong
and
that
they
agree
with
the
government
that
your
rights
had
survived,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
now,
here
you
are
caught
between
the
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
it?
well,
you
could
turn
your
claims
around,
you
could
say,
re
--
you
could
say,
you
--
rather
than
asking
us
to
affirm
or
reverse,
you
can
ask
us
to
reverse
or
affirm.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
one
thing
mr.
hobbs,
i
must
say,
i
noticed
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
this
supplemental
memorandum
raise
still
another
point.
that's
an
equal
footing
point
that
the
--
after
their
admission
to
the
union
in
1846,
was
it,
that
this
treaty
of
1854
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
make.
that
all
the
sovereignty
had
--
by
force
of
the
form
of
the
admission
statute
under
equal
footing
doctrine.
all
rights
of
sovereignty
had
gone
over
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
federal
government
had
no
right
to
make
that
treaty
on
fishing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
may
be
answers
but
wisconsin
has
--
is
not
here
to
argue
this,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
made
a
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
though
it
was
valid
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
position
did
you
take
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
you
send
--
did
you
take
the
position
on
the
treaty
rather
on
the
termination
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
dissolved
the
tribe
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
you
must
have
concluded
that
since
the
termination
act
--
if
the
termination
act
dissolve
the
tribe
and
therefore
ended
the
rights,
you
must
have
got
on
set
but
nevertheless,
that
there
is
no
right
to
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
termination?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
a
--
what
if
it
were
held
that
the
--
indeed
the
indians
did
have
hunting
and
fishing
rights
under
the
treaty
and
the
termination
act
did
terminate
those
rights
the
government's
position
is
no
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
there
--
the
nature
that
--
do
you
--
so
you
now
take
the
--
you
now
say
they
had
fishing
--
hunting
and
fishing
rights
under
the
treaty.
what
if
they
were
of
that
nature
and
--
but
it's
held
that
the
termination
act
did
extinguish
them
like
the
wisconsin
court
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
reason
i
asked
was
that
if
there's
another
sound
ground
for
affirmance
here,
besides
agreeing
with
the
court
of
claims'
holding
that
the
termination
act
did
not
extinguish
this
right,
why
you
had
never
reached
that
question,
whether
the
treaty
did
or
didn't
extinguish
them?
but
you
don't
--
i
thought
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
if
you
--
but
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
termination
act
did
extinguish
the
free
rights,
but
if
there
nevertheless
was
a
basis
for
saying
no
compensation,
you
would
still
affirm?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
anything
to
say
about
mr.
justice
fortas'
questions
to
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
about
--
that
who
really
enjoys
these
rights
now
that
you
say
they
have,
are
they
individual,
tribal
or
isn't
it
--
or
are
they
in
the
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
in
1975?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
really
have
to
think
that
through
though
here
to
arrive
--here
we
are
asked
to
declare
in
effect
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
still
exists
in
something
called
the
“tribe”,
i
suppose,
and
some
individuals
and
that
1975
its
--
something
is
going
to
happen
that
may
be
just
like
cinderella
at
the
stroke
of
midnight
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
don't
you
really
have
to
think
it
through
now?
what
bothers
me
about
this
is
we
have
here
an
action
brought
by
the
tribe,
the
corporation
and
the
certain
individuals,
that's
right,
isn't
it
and
they're
--
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
statute
also
says
that
this
interest
shall
be
descend
--
be
distributable
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
so
that
they
will
--
thereafter
they
go
by
inheritance.
it
looks
like
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right
or
when
the
tribe,
as
a
legal
entity
has
been
terminated
under
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hobbs,
i
take
it
that
in
your
view,
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
separate
rights
from
the
ownership
of
the
real
estate
and
that
they
will
--
they
can
be
there
held
separately
and
may
be
passed
around
separately
and
that
no
matter
who
might
end
up
owning
these
lands,
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
will
still
in
here
in
the
tribe
and
its
members?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
--
i
suppose
that
the
indians
have
hunting
and
fishing
rights
that
on
these
land
no
matter
who
owns
that
it
isn't
just
a
right
to
hunt
personally
in
the
members
of
the
tribe.
they
themselves
could
issue
hunting
licenses
and
charge
for
the
purpose
just
like,
i
suppose,
private
owners
anywhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
you
would
say
that
the
state
might
be
able
to
regulate
hunting
by
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
on
this
--
if
the
corporation
which
the
--
the
corporation
in
the
--
which
owns
the
land
and
the
indians
own
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
agree
for
--
that
people
may
come
on
the
land
to
hunt
and
fish,
the
state
may
regulate
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
the
state
could
tell
the
indians,
“you
may
have
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
but
you
may
not
let
any
non-indians
fish
except
in
fishing
season?”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
nobody
can
hunt
quail,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
your
permission
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
indians.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they
actually
formalize
their
existence
--
their
continued
existence
under
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
around
incorporated
to
something
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
there
are
evidence
--
the
evidence
is
that
the
tribe's
intention
to
remain
and
exist.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
i
gather
the
fishing
rights
zone,
by
the
tribe
are
exercisable
by
the
members,
but
only
by
the
members
of
the
tribe
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
also
with
qualified
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
tribe
doesn't
own
the
property
it
ignores
so
it
couldn't
license
as
landowners.
justice
byron
r.
white
fishing
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
also
rights
which
would
override
whoever
owned
the
right
which
would
be
sort
of
the
right
to
fishing
and
goes
unconnected
with
the
ownership
of
land,
whoever
owned
that
land
would
have
to
permit
the
indians
to
fish
on
it.
that
is
our
position,
yes.
and
a
position
upheld
by
this
court
in
two
cases,
the
winans
and
suffolk
cases
which
held
that
land
formally
owned
by
the
tribe
which
receded
to
the
united
states
and
later
patented
to
a
white
settler,
nevertheless
the
indians
who
had
reserved
a
treaty
right
could
come
back
on
the
land
and
climb
the
white
owner's
fences
and
cross
his
land
and
reach
their
fishing
stations.
we
argue
for
the
same
attribute
of
our
rights.
to
proceed
then
after
61,
after
the
termination
act
became
effective,
we
have
this
situation.
the
tribal
forest
in
the
middle,
the
tribal
trust
funds
and
the
personal
property
was
all
owned
and
operated
by
the
menominee
enterprises,
inc.
which
was
the
business
operation
of
the
tribe.
the
government
of
the
reservation
passed
to
the
new
county
government.
the
people
--
this
people
living
together
and
sharing
common
traditions
and
culture
setting
them
apart
in
some
respect
from
their
white
neighbors,
continued
to
exist
as
a
tribe.
they
had
meetings,
they
elected
leaders,
they
discussed
local
problems
and
protecting
the
hunting
and
fishing
problem.
in
short,
they
continued
to
be
a
tribe.
now,
when
the
state
in
1962
declared
that
it
was
going
to
enforce
state
hunting
and
fishing
regulations
on
this
reservation,
the
business
corporation
didn't
care.
it
had
its
profit
to
make.the
county
government
didn't
care,
only
the
tribe
cared.
the
tribe
existed,
it
cared,
it
met
and
it
resolved
that
it
would
fight
this
decision
and
later
in
the
fall
of
1962
when
the
state
arrested
three
menominee
indians
for
violation
of
regulations,
this
case
began.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
have
to
consider
whether
or
not
this
treaty,
although
it
may
have
granted
the
fishing
and
hunting
rights
while
the
indians
own
the
land,
nevertheless,
the
rights
were
not
tied
in
the
land?
i
mean,
it
made
the
--
certainly,
they
may
have
had
it
but
the
words
of
the
treaty
are
that
to
--
giving
the
land
of
the
indians
for
a
home
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held.
and
you
say
that
because
--
that
the
way
indians
held
the
land
that
they
use
for
hunting
and
fishing.
but
now
that
they've
conveyed
--
where
the
tribe's
convey
the
way
the
land
that
the
corporation
may
sell
it
off
to
private
parties
or
allocate
it
to
private
individuals.
you
say
that
nevertheless,
the
fishing
rights
survived
the
alienation
of
the
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
have
any
cases
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
what
the
--
where
did
they
get
the
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
does
the
treaty
say
in
those
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
that's
somewhat
different
language
there
in
this
treaty
which
have
--
which
ties
it
to
the
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
it
would
be
quite
understandable
the
intent
of
the
treaty
as
long
as
they
used
it
as
a
home
and
lived
on
the
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
cut
--
it
would
cut
them
off
in
the
sense
that
it
would
subject
them
to
state
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
wouldn't
their
--
the
power
to
--
to
fish
on
the
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
could
exclude
others
from
fishing
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
as
long
--
as
long
as
they
own
the
land,
they
couldn't
exclude
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
that?
i
mean,
how
it
would
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
certainly,
you
couldn't
argue
that
they
intended
to
deprive
the
menominees
of
--
of
ownership
of
the
land
because
they
had
conveyed
the
trust
property.
they
would
have
conveyed
it
to
the
tribe
but
they
didn't
do
it
and
conveyed
it
to
the
corporation
the
tribe
designated.
and
i
would
suppose
that
any
owner
--
any
owner
of
the
land
that
exclude
people
from
fishing,
crossing
his
land
to
fish
but
it
doesn't
exclude
him
from
using
the
--
floating
in
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
--
you
might
argue
they
would
be
entitled
to
--
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
compensation
for
that
termination.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
indians
--
if
the
indians
under
the
termination
act
and
the
plan
they
submitted
had
provided
for
the
test
property,
namely
this
land
to
be
conveyed
to
the
tribe
rather
than
to
some
private
property
corporation,
which
is
one
of
the
alternatives
of
the
group,
i
suppose
that
ownership
of
the
land
can
stay
with
the
tribe
with
--
at
the
very
--
at
least
in
that
situation
that
have
fishing
rights
on
the
--
on
the
waters
except
for
--
and
--
and
--
and
perhaps
the
right
to
exclude
as
private
property
owners
as
anybody
else.
but
the
termination
act
at
the
very
minimum
said
that
the
fishing
rights
shall
be
subject
to
state
law,
which
was
not
true
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
the
state
conservation
laws
apply.
that's
one
--
one
thing
that
happened
with
the
fishing
rights.
secondly,
if
under
state
law,
other
persons
could
have
entered
the
property
to
fish
by
way
of
the
river.
i
suppose
that's
another
thing
that's
another
thing
they
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
those
fishing
rights
at
the
very
minimum.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
indians
had
maintained
ownership
of
the
property
themselves.
at
the
minimum,
that's
what
would
have
happened
with
the
fishing
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
still
leaves
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
though
of
--
that
if
the
fishing
rights
were
attached
to
the
land,
would
the
indians
decide
to
convey
the
land?
but
i
suppose
if
that
happened
afterwards,
then
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
non-indians,
i
suspect?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
indians
--
all
indians
or
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
termin
--
the
termination
act
really
didn't
take
effect
until
the
plan
was
presented
and
approved
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
though
the
plan
in
effect
at
the
same
time
as
the
termination
act
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
it
didn't
--
the
termination
act
had
no
consequence
on
the
menominees
until
this
plan
was
approved
and
the
conveyance
was
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
it
called
for
them
to
present
a
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
the
plan
is
provided
like
the
act
contemplated
for
the
management
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
and
it
had
specifically
said
that
these
fishing
rights
shall
be
held
by
the
tribe.
then,
there
would
be
no
prob
--
question
about
the
--
about
it
with
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
plan
had
actually
relate
--
expressly
provided
for
the
vesting
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
the
tribe,
which
shall
maintain
control
over
them
and
so
on
and
so
forth.i
suppose
wisconsin
would
have
a
pretty
tough
time
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
all
of
these
rights
that
you
suggest
would
come
into
an
end
with
the
conveyance
of
the
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
the
stock
is
held
privately.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
stock
is
transferable
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
indians
who
own
the
stock
are
--
when
the
restrictions
on
that
stock
are
lifted
and
they
sell
it
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
corporation
tend
to
sold
the
entire
lands
that
the
tribe
formally
or
did
you
say
it's
held
for
the
tribe
and
replaced
it
with
money,
the
tribe
would
no
longer
or
no
one
of
the
tribe
would
have
any
fishing
rights
on
the
land
that
was
sold
to
a
third
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
just
for
a
moment,
what
is
the
law
on
the
termination
of
indian
and
the
treaties
with
indians
with
congressional
power
to
terminate
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
legally
enforceable
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
--
within
the
case
of
the
united
states
is
subject
to
liability
--
justice
byron
r.
white
created
by
a
treaty.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
shoshone
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
could
you
--
do
you
agree
with
what
was
said
a
while
ago
by
one
of
the
other
counsel
that
--
that
perhaps
there
are
some
question
about
whether
the
tribe
voluntarily
entered
into
this
termination.
i
take
that
the
termination
--
was
termination
act
coercive?
i
mean
was
it
going
to
take
place
no
matter
what
or
did
they
--
if
they
have
refused
to
present
a
plan
that
they
have
stated
in
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
that
--
except
for
that
finding
that
the
act
would
not
have
required
terms
of
--
would
not
have
forced
termination
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can't
tell
them
the
terms
of
the
act
itself
whether
or
not
the
consent
of
the
indians
is
necessary
for
termination?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
they
would
have
to
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now,
the
government
agrees
with
your
position
at
least
as
to
the
termination
act
did
not
extinguish,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
hasn't
always
been
the
government's
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
now
is
no
one
in
this
case
before
us
arguing
the
side
about
the
termination?
justice
byron
r.
white
extinguishment
through
the
termination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
its
not
--
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
isn't
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
different
in
that
so
to
speak,
the
federal
government
would
permit
to
stay
the
wisconsin
to
put
the
very
regulation
on
these
hunting
rights
that
were
involved
in
this
case
and
would
say
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
unable
to
keep
people
from
hunting
with
a
light
at
night
on
this
reservation
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
carrying
a
gun
in
a
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
that's
rather
a
big
difference
between
you,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
the
judgment
that
we're
reviewing
because
that
the
--
because
in
any
event,
apparently
nobody
here
objects
to
this
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
we're
reviewing
judgments
instead
of
opinions,
why
--
there
is
really
no
adverse
interest
here,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
both
want
us
to
do
what,
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
affirm
it,
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
government
disagree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
if
you're
wrong,
if
the
court
of
the
claims
was
wrong,
we
have
to
reverse.
does
the
government
deny
your
right
to
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
the
government's
argument
is
not
the
termination
act
expose
these
lands
to
any
different
kind
of
regulation
than
they
were
subject
to
before.
it's
just
they
were
just
subject
to
regulation
at
the
hands
of
different
governmental
entity.
they
would
--
they're
argument
is
that
--
is
in
terms
to
defining
what
the
treaty
rights
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
termination
act
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
therefore,
no
compensation.
i
mean,
you
never
lost
--
you've
never
lost
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
--
let's
assume
that
you
can't
hunt
and
fish
with
complete
freedom
that
you
are
subject
to
the
kind
of
limited
regulation
the
government
seems
to
think
you're
subject
to,
would
you
then
say
that
you're
entitled
to
some
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
didn't
you
ask
for
reversal
up
here
or
why
don't
you
urge
reversal
now
no
matter
what
your
previous
position
has
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
wisconsin
says
you
don't
have
them
and
the
court
of
claims
isn't
going
to
change
the
wisconsin
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
if
a
--
their
hunting
or
fishing
activity
a
commercial,
you
said
they
eat
what
they
caught
but
do
they
have
a
surplus
that
they
sell
or
what
else
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
among
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
among
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
a
publicly
commercial
venture,
any
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hobbs,
what
about
the
additional
points
of
this
supplemental
memo
that's
distributed
to
us
only
this
morning
by
the
state
of
wisconsin?
that
even
if
the
court
of
claims
is
right
and
you
were
wrong
and
the
government
is
right,
that
these
rights
survived
the
termination
act
that
nevertheless
that
presently
a
--
no
members
of
the
menominee
tribe
who
could
exercise
those
rights
because
the
roads,
a
fire
road
travel
roads
were
closed
by
the
secretary
of
interior
at
sometime,
don't
say
when.
what
about
that
point?
is
that
any
--
would
we
have
to
decide
that
even
if
we
affirm?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
rather
important
detail.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
determines
who
gets
on
the
roll?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
corporation
which
holds
titles
to
this
land,
just
a
holding
entity,
is
that
all
this
or
is
that
--
is
its
governing
board
also
the
governing
board
for
the
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
“outsiders”
what
do
you
mean
“outsider”?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
their
business
venture?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
do
you
claim
are
entitled
to
hunting
rights,
just
the
members
of
the
menominee
tribe
or
is
it
the
corporation
which
or
is
it
a
personal
thing
or
does
it
attach
to
the
land
and
therefore
available
to
whoever
owns
the
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
the
property
belongs
to
the
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
certainly
just
relates
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
statute
says
that
interest
shall
be
alienable
in
accordance
to
such
regulations
may
be
adopted
by
the
tribe.
did
they
ever
adopt
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
a
membership
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
before
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
united
states
agrees
with
you
on
that?
what's
the
source
of
their
supposed
power
to
put
some
sort
of
minimal
regulations
on
hunting
and
fishing
rights
which
they
concede
these
indians
obtained
under
this
treaty?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
the
united
states'
position,
do
you
think
they
--
don't
you
think
that
they
seem
to
--
since
united
states
had
some
power
over
these
indian
hunting
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean.
so
they
claim
that
the
hunting
rights
were
held
by
them
as
trustee
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
your
petition
for
certiorari
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
loss
out
and
you
ask
this
court
to
say
or
to
review
that
position
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
to
say
it
was
wrong
and
we
refused
to
review
the
decision
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
so
then,
if
that
was
the
end
of
the
line
and
your
claim
to
the
rights
--
then
you're
only
remedy
thereafter
was
for
compensation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
correct?
so
you
went
into
the
court
of
claims
and
asked
for
compensation
on
the
premise
that
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
right
or
wrong
that
judgment
was
final
since
we
have
refused
to
review
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
to
your
other
amazement,
the
court
of
claims
says
that
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
was
wrong
and
that
they
agree
with
the
government
that
your
rights
had
survived,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
now,
here
you
are
caught
between
the
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
it?
well,
you
could
turn
your
claims
around,
you
could
say,
re
--
you
could
say,
you
--
rather
than
asking
us
to
affirm
or
reverse,
you
can
ask
us
to
reverse
or
affirm.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
one
thing
mr.
hobbs,
i
must
say,
i
noticed
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
this
supplemental
memorandum
raise
still
another
point.
that's
an
equal
footing
point
that
the
--
after
their
admission
to
the
union
in
1846,
was
it,
that
this
treaty
of
1854
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
make.
that
all
the
sovereignty
had
--
by
force
of
the
form
of
the
admission
statute
under
equal
footing
doctrine.
all
rights
of
sovereignty
had
gone
over
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
federal
government
had
no
right
to
make
that
treaty
on
fishing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
may
be
answers
but
wisconsin
has
--
is
not
here
to
argue
this,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
made
a
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
though
it
was
valid
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
position
did
you
take
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
you
send
--
did
you
take
the
position
on
the
treaty
rather
on
the
termination
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
dissolved
the
tribe
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
you
must
have
concluded
that
since
the
termination
act
--
if
the
termination
act
dissolve
the
tribe
and
therefore
ended
the
rights,
you
must
have
got
on
set
but
nevertheless,
that
there
is
no
right
to
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
termination?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
a
--
what
if
it
were
held
that
the
--
indeed
the
indians
did
have
hunting
and
fishing
rights
under
the
treaty
and
the
termination
act
did
terminate
those
rights
the
government's
position
is
no
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
there
--
the
nature
that
--
do
you
--
so
you
now
take
the
--
you
now
say
they
had
fishing
--
hunting
and
fishing
rights
under
the
treaty.
what
if
they
were
of
that
nature
and
--
but
it's
held
that
the
termination
act
did
extinguish
them
like
the
wisconsin
court
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
reason
i
asked
was
that
if
there's
another
sound
ground
for
affirmance
here,
besides
agreeing
with
the
court
of
claims'
holding
that
the
termination
act
did
not
extinguish
this
right,
why
you
had
never
reached
that
question,
whether
the
treaty
did
or
didn't
extinguish
them?
but
you
don't
--
i
thought
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
if
you
--
but
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
termination
act
did
extinguish
the
free
rights,
but
if
there
nevertheless
was
a
basis
for
saying
no
compensation,
you
would
still
affirm?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
anything
to
say
about
mr.
justice
fortas'
questions
to
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
about
--
that
who
really
enjoys
these
rights
now
that
you
say
they
have,
are
they
individual,
tribal
or
isn't
it
--
or
are
they
in
the
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
in
1975?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
really
have
to
think
that
through
though
here
to
arrive
--here
we
are
asked
to
declare
in
effect
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
still
exists
in
something
called
the
“tribe”,
i
suppose,
and
some
individuals
and
that
1975
its
--
something
is
going
to
happen
that
may
be
just
like
cinderella
at
the
stroke
of
midnight
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
don't
you
really
have
to
think
it
through
now?
what
bothers
me
about
this
is
we
have
here
an
action
brought
by
the
tribe,
the
corporation
and
the
certain
individuals,
that's
right,
isn't
it
and
they're
--
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
statute
also
says
that
this
interest
shall
be
descend
--
be
distributable
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
so
that
they
will
--
thereafter
they
go
by
inheritance.
it
looks
like
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right
or
when
the
tribe,
as
a
legal
entity
has
been
terminated
under
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hobbs,
i
take
it
that
in
your
view,
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
separate
rights
from
the
ownership
of
the
real
estate
and
that
they
will
--
they
can
be
there
held
separately
and
may
be
passed
around
separately
and
that
no
matter
who
might
end
up
owning
these
lands,
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
will
still
in
here
in
the
tribe
and
its
members?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
--
i
suppose
that
the
indians
have
hunting
and
fishing
rights
that
on
these
land
no
matter
who
owns
that
it
isn't
just
a
right
to
hunt
personally
in
the
members
of
the
tribe.
they
themselves
could
issue
hunting
licenses
and
charge
for
the
purpose
just
like,
i
suppose,
private
owners
anywhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
you
would
say
that
the
state
might
be
able
to
regulate
hunting
by
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
on
this
--
if
the
corporation
which
the
--
the
corporation
in
the
--
which
owns
the
land
and
the
indians
own
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
agree
for
--
that
people
may
come
on
the
land
to
hunt
and
fish,
the
state
may
regulate
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
the
state
could
tell
the
indians,
“you
may
have
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
but
you
may
not
let
any
non-indians
fish
except
in
fishing
season?”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
nobody
can
hunt
quail,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
your
permission
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
indians.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they
actually
formalize
their
existence
--
their
continued
existence
under
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
around
incorporated
to
something
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
there
are
evidence
--
the
evidence
is
that
the
tribe's
intention
to
remain
and
exist.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
i
gather
the
fishing
rights
zone,
by
the
tribe
are
exercisable
by
the
members,
but
only
by
the
members
of
the
tribe
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
also
with
qualified
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
tribe
doesn't
own
the
property
it
ignores
so
it
couldn't
license
as
landowners.
justice
byron
r.
white
fishing
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
also
rights
which
would
override
whoever
owned
the
right
which
would
be
sort
of
the
right
to
fishing
and
goes
unconnected
with
the
ownership
of
land,
whoever
owned
that
land
would
have
to
permit
the
indians
to
fish
on
it.
that
is
our
position,
yes.
and
a
position
upheld
by
this
court
in
two
cases,
the
winans
and
suffolk
cases
which
held
that
land
formally
owned
by
the
tribe
which
receded
to
the
united
states
and
later
patented
to
a
white
settler,
nevertheless
the
indians
who
had
reserved
a
treaty
right
could
come
back
on
the
land
and
climb
the
white
owner's
fences
and
cross
his
land
and
reach
their
fishing
stations.
we
argue
for
the
same
attribute
of
our
rights.
to
proceed
then
after
61,
after
the
termination
act
became
effective,
we
have
this
situation.
the
tribal
forest
in
the
middle,
the
tribal
trust
funds
and
the
personal
property
was
all
owned
and
operated
by
the
menominee
enterprises,
inc.
which
was
the
business
operation
of
the
tribe.
the
government
of
the
reservation
passed
to
the
new
county
government.
the
people
--
this
people
living
together
and
sharing
common
traditions
and
culture
setting
them
apart
in
some
respect
from
their
white
neighbors,
continued
to
exist
as
a
tribe.
they
had
meetings,
they
elected
leaders,
they
discussed
local
problems
and
protecting
the
hunting
and
fishing
problem.
in
short,
they
continued
to
be
a
tribe.
now,
when
the
state
in
1962
declared
that
it
was
going
to
enforce
state
hunting
and
fishing
regulations
on
this
reservation,
the
business
corporation
didn't
care.
it
had
its
profit
to
make.the
county
government
didn't
care,
only
the
tribe
cared.
the
tribe
existed,
it
cared,
it
met
and
it
resolved
that
it
would
fight
this
decision
and
later
in
the
fall
of
1962
when
the
state
arrested
three
menominee
indians
for
violation
of
regulations,
this
case
began.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
have
to
consider
whether
or
not
this
treaty,
although
it
may
have
granted
the
fishing
and
hunting
rights
while
the
indians
own
the
land,
nevertheless,
the
rights
were
not
tied
in
the
land?
i
mean,
it
made
the
--
certainly,
they
may
have
had
it
but
the
words
of
the
treaty
are
that
to
--
giving
the
land
of
the
indians
for
a
home
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held.
and
you
say
that
because
--
that
the
way
indians
held
the
land
that
they
use
for
hunting
and
fishing.
but
now
that
they've
conveyed
--
where
the
tribe's
convey
the
way
the
land
that
the
corporation
may
sell
it
off
to
private
parties
or
allocate
it
to
private
individuals.
you
say
that
nevertheless,
the
fishing
rights
survived
the
alienation
of
the
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
have
any
cases
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
what
the
--
where
did
they
get
the
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
does
the
treaty
say
in
those
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
that's
somewhat
different
language
there
in
this
treaty
which
have
--
which
ties
it
to
the
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
it
would
be
quite
understandable
the
intent
of
the
treaty
as
long
as
they
used
it
as
a
home
and
lived
on
the
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
cut
--
it
would
cut
them
off
in
the
sense
that
it
would
subject
them
to
state
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
wouldn't
their
--
the
power
to
--
to
fish
on
the
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
could
exclude
others
from
fishing
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
as
long
--
as
long
as
they
own
the
land,
they
couldn't
exclude
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
that?
i
mean,
how
it
would
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
certainly,
you
couldn't
argue
that
they
intended
to
deprive
the
menominees
of
--
of
ownership
of
the
land
because
they
had
conveyed
the
trust
property.
they
would
have
conveyed
it
to
the
tribe
but
they
didn't
do
it
and
conveyed
it
to
the
corporation
the
tribe
designated.
and
i
would
suppose
that
any
owner
--
any
owner
of
the
land
that
exclude
people
from
fishing,
crossing
his
land
to
fish
but
it
doesn't
exclude
him
from
using
the
--
floating
in
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
--
you
might
argue
they
would
be
entitled
to
--
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
compensation
for
that
termination.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
indians
--
if
the
indians
under
the
termination
act
and
the
plan
they
submitted
had
provided
for
the
test
property,
namely
this
land
to
be
conveyed
to
the
tribe
rather
than
to
some
private
property
corporation,
which
is
one
of
the
alternatives
of
the
group,
i
suppose
that
ownership
of
the
land
can
stay
with
the
tribe
with
--
at
the
very
--
at
least
in
that
situation
that
have
fishing
rights
on
the
--
on
the
waters
except
for
--
and
--
and
--
and
perhaps
the
right
to
exclude
as
private
property
owners
as
anybody
else.
but
the
termination
act
at
the
very
minimum
said
that
the
fishing
rights
shall
be
subject
to
state
law,
which
was
not
true
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
the
state
conservation
laws
apply.
that's
one
--
one
thing
that
happened
with
the
fishing
rights.
secondly,
if
under
state
law,
other
persons
could
have
entered
the
property
to
fish
by
way
of
the
river.
i
suppose
that's
another
thing
that's
another
thing
they
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
those
fishing
rights
at
the
very
minimum.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
indians
had
maintained
ownership
of
the
property
themselves.
at
the
minimum,
that's
what
would
have
happened
with
the
fishing
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
still
leaves
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
though
of
--
that
if
the
fishing
rights
were
attached
to
the
land,
would
the
indians
decide
to
convey
the
land?
but
i
suppose
if
that
happened
afterwards,
then
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
non-indians,
i
suspect?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
indians
--
all
indians
or
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
termin
--
the
termination
act
really
didn't
take
effect
until
the
plan
was
presented
and
approved
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
though
the
plan
in
effect
at
the
same
time
as
the
termination
act
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
it
didn't
--
the
termination
act
had
no
consequence
on
the
menominees
until
this
plan
was
approved
and
the
conveyance
was
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
it
called
for
them
to
present
a
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
the
plan
is
provided
like
the
act
contemplated
for
the
management
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
and
it
had
specifically
said
that
these
fishing
rights
shall
be
held
by
the
tribe.
then,
there
would
be
no
prob
--
question
about
the
--
about
it
with
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
plan
had
actually
relate
--
expressly
provided
for
the
vesting
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
the
tribe,
which
shall
maintain
control
over
them
and
so
on
and
so
forth.i
suppose
wisconsin
would
have
a
pretty
tough
time
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
all
of
these
rights
that
you
suggest
would
come
into
an
end
with
the
conveyance
of
the
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
the
stock
is
held
privately.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
stock
is
transferable
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
indians
who
own
the
stock
are
--
when
the
restrictions
on
that
stock
are
lifted
and
they
sell
it
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
corporation
tend
to
sold
the
entire
lands
that
the
tribe
formally
or
did
you
say
it's
held
for
the
tribe
and
replaced
it
with
money,
the
tribe
would
no
longer
or
no
one
of
the
tribe
would
have
any
fishing
rights
on
the
land
that
was
sold
to
a
third
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
just
for
a
moment,
what
is
the
law
on
the
termination
of
indian
and
the
treaties
with
indians
with
congressional
power
to
terminate
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
legally
enforceable
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
--
within
the
case
of
the
united
states
is
subject
to
liability
--
justice
byron

white
created
by
a
treaty.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
shoshone
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
could
you
--
do
you
agree
with
what
was
said
a
while
ago
by
one
of
the
other
counsel
that
--
that
perhaps
there
are
some
