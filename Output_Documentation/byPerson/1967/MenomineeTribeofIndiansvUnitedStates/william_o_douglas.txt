justice
william
o.
douglas
i
asked
you
earlier
for
the
reference
in
the
record
for
the
provision
for
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
i
gather
there
it
is
not
expressed.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
only
implied.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
have
any
question,
the
problem
here
is
respecting
future
membership
of
the
tribe,
the
enrolment
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
book
has
been
closed
i
--
as
i
understand.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
is
the
definition
of
indians
for
this
purpose
of
this
treaty?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
they
--
the
only
tribe
i
have
any
real
acquaintance
with
is
the
tribe
out
west,
the
yakama
tribe?
they're
3,000
--
they're
only
300
full
bloods
and
they
take
--
that
they,
the
tribe,
count
as
an
indian.
anybody
was
164.
is
there
any
rule
of
thumb
that
your
tribe
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
that
means
in
that
in
time,
this
will
--
they'll
disappear
then
because
there's
no
reservation
and
nobody
is
being
born
in
that
place.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know
they're
being
born
but
not
on
the
reservation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
they
take
me
in?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
i
go
out
there
and
hunt
a
fish,
maybe
i
would.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
think
--
do
you
think
united
states
is
responsible
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
for
the
damages
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
we
should
reverse
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
think
any
has
become
a
citizen
until
much
later
don't
you
think?
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
this
is
1954.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
that's
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
not
an
intervenor?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
i
take
that
anything
we
hold
here
is
not
--
it
does
not
conclude
the
state
of
wisconsin
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
is
why
we're
asking,
is
that
--
you
ought
to
do
if
we
don't
agree?
justice
william
o.
douglas
alright,
thank
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
think
there's
nay
case
holds
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
the
federal
government
never
under
took
to
regulate
fishing
rights
and
hunting
rights
on
reservation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
not
here.
they
never
undertook
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
was
an
agreement
between
the
state
and
the
owners
of
the
land.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
in
the
beginning
--
the
problem
with
conservation
is
the
beginning
to
have
complicated
matter
for
example
that
indian
reservation
is
surrounded
--
it's
not
in
isolation
from
the
rest
of
united
states,
it
is
surrounded
by
other
country
and
the
indians
since
they
have
one
preservation,
i
know
they
think
they
got
all
the
game.
is
it
--
little
forms
and
everything
the
moose
and
that
reservation
is
restocked
by
the
wildlife
from
the
outside
of
the
reservation
that
comes
in
from
the
outside?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
asked
you
earlier
for
the
reference
in
the

for
the

what

(inaudible)
