justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
attorney
general
has
now
sent
a
letter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
supplemental
memorandum.
well,
if
there's
no
difference
between
you
and
the
federal
government,
should
this
case
be
tried
without
hearing
from
the
state
oral
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
that
you're
real
adversary
here
is
the
state
of
wisconsin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
not
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
are
here
in
a
case
arguing
without
the
state
which
is
vitally
injured
being
present
to
argue
it
overly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
see
what
i
decide
that
there's
a
protest
here
founded
by
the
state
in
connection
with
these
matters.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
are
the
party
in
interest
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
should
we
hear
the
case?
and
the
two
parties
here
before
us
say,
“we
agree
that
nobody
(inaudible)
on
this
but
the
state
of
wisconsin.
they're
the
adversary
parties
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
circumstances
came
so
that
now
there's
nobody
but
the
state
as
an
adversary
and
there's
no
adversary
argument
here,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
no
adversary
between
you
and
the
federal
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
hobbs,
did
you
ask
us
to
reverse
this
case
when
you
asked
for
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
find
nothing
in
the
petition
which
indicates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
ever
asked
that
the
judgment
be
reversed
or
do
you
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
an
alternate,
do
you
ask
that
the
judgment
be
reversed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
asked
us
to
affirm,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
the
government
ever
asked
anything
to
be
done
in
this
case
except
it
be
affirmed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
--
asking
now
that
it
be
affirmed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
did
not
ask
us
to
reverse
it?
did
you
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
or
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
of
you
want
it
affirmed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
want
a
review?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
thing
that
were
said
or
something
it
was
done
or
something
else
but
you
never
asked
that
this
judgment
to
be
reversed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
nevertheless,
the
fact
remains,
does
it
not?
that
whatever
you
might
want
to
have
litigated
a
year
after,
you
are
not
asking
that
this
judgment
be
reversed?
what
jurisdiction
do
we
have?
simply
to
bring
it
up
by
the
book,
why
just
ask
it
to
be
affirmed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you've
done
is
to
sue
for
compensation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
didn't
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
didn't
get
it,
did
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
now,
you
are
asking
if
the
judgment
be
affirmed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
you
didn't
get
what
you
asked
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
time
you
have
different
procedures
in
order
to
get
resolution
of
a
dilemma.
you
may
have
different
kinds
of
lawsuits
but
i
have
not
known
of
any
here
before
that
allowed
this
court
to
bring
a
case
up
to
it,
your
affirmance
when
both
sides
wanted
it
affirmed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
usually
when
a
person
brings
a
case
up
here,
he's
complaining
about
a
judgment
being
rendered
against
him
which
he
wants
to
set
aside
or
reversed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
doing
that?
you
did
not
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
do
that
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
why?
that's
what
i'd
like
to
hear
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
you
have
valuable
rights
which
the
government
has
taken
away
from
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
why
have
you
been
arguing
here
before
that
be
affirmed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
are
they
in
a
position
to
answer
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
claiming
your
position
to
--
right
to
be
here
to
argue
the
case
against
the
state
of
wisconsin
although
you're
denying
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
their
right
to
be
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there's
such
thing
sometime
as
indispensable
parties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
how
you
can
possibly
ask
for
the
case
to
be
affirmed.
if
you
are
claiming
that
the
state
of
wisconsin's
statute
is
invalid
because
what
you
are
raising
is
your
right
so
--
or
recover
or
rights
that
have
property
rights
as
if
been
destroyed,
why
is
it
not
inevitable
that
you
have
to
ask
for
a
reversal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
denied
you
the
right
to
recover?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ask
them
for
anything
except
the
right
to
recover?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
of
claims.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
still
claim
you're
entitled
to
recover
if
that
law
is
invalid
in
wisconsin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say
the
position
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
at
least
a
little
novel
to
say
the
least
for
a
person
who
claims
this
cases
up,
get
it
reversed,
fed
up
and
say,
“i
want
you
to
either
reverse
it
or
affirm
it”
to
either
one
you
see
fit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
60
some
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
clairborne,
in
that
connection,
does
the
government
think
it
would
be
better
either
to
adopt
the
suggestion
of
justice
brennan
that
this
matter
go
over
to
a
time
when
under
that
technique,
we
can
consider
all
the
questions
and
get
wisconsin
are
in
the
alternative
either
--
simply
now
continue
the
case,
invite
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
come
in
and
argue
on
the
basis
that
he
is
now
arguing
at
least
with
one
for
--
to
reverse
it
and
let
the
state
of
wisconsin
back
him
up.
do
you
not
think
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
do
--
take
some
source
whereby
the
state
of
wisconsin
can
be
here
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you,
it
couldn't
be
done
in
one
of
those
two
ways
or
may
be
another
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
wouldn't
be
hard
to
set
the
case
down
for
reargument
and
let
--
invite
wisconsin
to
come
and
of
course
it
would
come.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
myself
would
be
much
better
satisfied
to
decide
the
basic
issues,
which
you
and
mr.
justice
fortas
were
discussing
as
--
if
we'd
had
an
argument
by
both
sides.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
it
--
you
say
about
that
now
that
now
--
the
tribe
--
i
didn't
quite
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
treaty
or
the
klamath?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i've
read
all
those
debates
on
those
termination
acts
and
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
time
there
two
line
of
thoughts:
one
was
what
you
have
just
said.
another
one
was
a
line
which
has
long
been
(inaudible)
among
certain
people
that
the
indians
should
no
longer
be
lead
under
the
federal
government
to
govern
it
--
govern
them
differently
to
what
they
govern
in
any
other
way.
i
think
probably,
we're
going
to
have
a
very
big
job
in
deciding,
your
court,
they
merely
decide.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
whether
this
question
has
come
up
here
and
argued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
some
provisions
of
that
act
which
do
assert
that
all
rights
like
hunting
and
fishing
are
not
destroyed,
that
are
not
solid
as
it
is
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
these
--
is
there
some
part
of
this
termination
act
as
it
relates
to
different
parts
of
the
country
which
provides
for
the
preservation
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
which
have
been
given
to
them
by
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
expressly
provided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
the
other
case,
it
is
not
expressly
provided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
wisconsin
act
did
not
to
provide
what
was
provided
in
the
klamath
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
indians
have
been
doing
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
members
of
the
tribe?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
testified
for
the
passing
of
the
bill
or
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
regulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
attorney
general
has
now
sent
a
letter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
supplemental
memorandum.
well,
if
there's
no

what
was
it
--
you
say
about
that
now
that
now
--
the
tribe
--
i
didn't
quite
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
treaty
or
the
klamath?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i've
read
all
those
debates
on
those
termination
acts
and
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
time
there
two
line
of
thoughts:
one
was
what
you
have
just
said.
another
one
was
a
line
which
has
long
been
(inaudible)
among
certain
people
that
the
indians
should
no
longer
be
lead
under
the
federal
government
to
govern
it
--
govern
them
differently
to
what
they
govern
in
any
other
way.
i
think
probably,
we're
going
to
have
a
very
big
job
in
deciding,
your
court,
they
merely
decide.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
whether
this
question
has
come
up
here
and
argued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
some
provisions
of
that
act
which
do
assert
that
all
rights
like
hunting
and
fishing
are
not
destroyed,
that
are
not
solid
as
it
is
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
these
--
is
there
some
part
of
this
termination
act
as
it
relates
to
different
parts
of
the
country
which
provides
for
the
preservation
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
which
have
been
given
to
them
by
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
expressly
provided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
the
other
case,
it
is
not
expressly
provided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
wisconsin
act
did
not
to
provide
what
was
provided
in
the
klamath
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
indians
have
been
doing
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
members
of
the
tribe?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
testified
for
the
passing
of
the
bill
or
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
regulation?
