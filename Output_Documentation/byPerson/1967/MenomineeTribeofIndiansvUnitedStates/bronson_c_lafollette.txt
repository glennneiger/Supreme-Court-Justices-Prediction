mr.

may
it
please

bronson
lafollette,
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
appearing
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
as
amicus
curiae
at
the
invitation
of
this
court.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
state
appears
here
as
amicus
curiae
and
has
a
--
a
very
keen
interest
in
the
resolution
of
the
issues
presented
by
this
case
because
the
issues
raised
in
this
case
have
a
direct
and
immediate
impact
on
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
protect
and
conserve
the
wildlife
hab
--
habitat,
which
it
holds
in
trust
for
all
of
its
citizens,
and
also
because
it
will
have
a
direct
and
immediate
impact
upon
the
citizens
of
wisconsin
residing
in
menominee
county,
this
court
is
fully
aware
of
the
facts
of
this
case
at
having
been
argued
previously
and
having
been
before
the
court
at
an
earlier
date.
and
the
legal
position
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
fully
set
forth
in
the
briefs,
and
i
won't
go
into
it
in
great
detail,
but
so
that
the
court
is
absolutely
clear,
i
would
refer
to
it
briefly.
first
of
all,
wisconsin
contends
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
of
the
menominee
tribe
were
acquired
under
the
treaty
of
1854.
we
contend
that
these
rights
were
cut
off
by
the
1954
menominee
termination
act
and
the
events
which
have
taken
place
subsequent
to
and
pursuant
to
that
act.
and
we
further
contend
that
the
cutting
off
of
these
viable
rights
was
an
act
for
which
compensation
is
due
and
owing
the
menominee
indians
by
the
federal
government.
first
of
all,
the
plain
language
of
the
termination
act
itself
in
our
view
events
as
an
intent
to
end
the
tribal
status
of
the
menominee
indians.
by
looking
at
the
very
words
of
the
act
itself,
the
language
is
clear
in
section
899.
it
says
that
the
menominees
will
not
be
entitled
to
any
of
the
services
performed
by
the
united
states
for
indians
because
of
their
status
as
indians
and
further,
that
the
laws
of
the
several
states
shall
apply
in
the
same
manner
as
to
other
citizens.
we
can
glean
an
indication
of
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
these
termination
acts
by
the
house
concurrent
congressional
resolution
108
which
says
that
the
purpose
of
termination
is
to
make
indians
subject
to
the
same
laws
as
other
citizens
and
assume
full
responsibility
as
citizens,
and
to
turn
over
the
federal
government's
trusteeship
to
a
responsible
indian
people.
the
menominee
termination
act
is
silent
as
to
the
question
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
in
our
view,
the
legislative
history,
which
is
cited
by
the
petitioner
at
the
very
best
is
inconclusive
on
this
point
and
certainly
does
not
support
the
contention
of
a
peti
--
of
the
petitioners.
first
of
all,
as
to
the
testimony
that
was
presented
to
the
committee
which
consider
--
was
considering,
the
termina
--
the
menominee
termination
act,
the
tribe's
own
attorney,
mr.
wilkinson
on
this
very
point
testified
that
the
passage
of
the
act
in
its
--in
the
form
then
being
considered
by
the
congress
would
have
the
effect
of
cutting
off
the
indians'
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
and
this
is
set
forth
fully
in
the
briefs.
furthermore,
this
was
not
the
only
version
of
the
termination
act
which
was
before
the
congress
at
this
particular
time.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
not
as
ordinary
other
citizens
if
they
conform
to
the
regulations
of
the
state.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
no,
they
could
not.
this
was
not
the
testimony
of
mr.
wilkinson
who
i
was
referring
to
when
i
made
this
point.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
correct.
mr.
wilkinson
testified
that
the
version
of
the
menominee
termination
act
which
finally
passed
the
congress
would
have
the
effect
of
cutting
off
the
treaty
rights
of
the
menominee
indians.
it's
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
i
do.
i
--
i
will
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
i
--
i
hope
to
have
the
court
understand
it
as
well.
in
addition
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
he
was
testifying
and
i
was
just
about
to
get
to
this
point.
he
was
testifying
in
favor
of
two
other
bills,
which
also
had
been
presented
at
the
specific
request
of
the
tribe,
which
would
have
specifically
preserved
hunting
and
fishing
rights
for
the
menominee
tribe.
and
--
but
--
but
congress,
in
view
of
this
conflicting
testimony
and
this
specific
testimony
of
the
counsel
for
the
tribe
that
the
version
that
finally
passed
which
was
silent
would
have
the
effect
of
cutting
off
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
chose
to
pass
the
silent
version.
and
we
contend
that
at
best,
the
legislative
history
is
inconclusive
and
all
it
shows
is
that
congress
had
two
versions
before
it,
one
which
specifically
reserved
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
and
the
one
which
finally
passed
which
was
silent.
and
therefore,
the
congress
passed
the
sil
--
with
--
with
this
testimony
before
the
congress
passed
the
silent
version.
and
if
anything,
we
contend
that
this
supports
our
position
that
these
rights
were
cut
off
because
if
they
were
to
have
any
specific
rights
beyond
ordinary
citizenship,
they
should
have
been
spelled
out
by
the
congress.
this
is
exactly
what
the
congress
did.
in
the
claimant
--
yes?
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
i
think
that
that
latter
point
is
resolved
by
the
body
of
law
which
says
that
the
rights
that
accrue
to
the
indian
tribe
under
all
treaties
is
subject
to
being
altered
or
amended
in
any
way
by
an
act
of
the
congress.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
it
would.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
all
we're
asking.
we
make
these
other
points
because
of
the
arguments
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
if
--
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
rights
which
they
acquired
under
the
treaty
were
exclusive
rights
and
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
these
exclusive
rights
were
now
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
they
could
only
exercise
these
rights
in
conformity
with
state
law,
then
of
course
the
federal
government
have
to
compensate
the
indians
for
the
loss
of
their
exclusive
rights.
but
we
are
contending
for
no
more
than
the
right
to
apply
our
hunting
and
fishing
laws
to
the
citizens
of
menominee
county
in
the
same
manner
that
they
apply
to
other
citizens
of
the
state.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
our
position
that
the
federal
government
terminated
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
be
inconsistent
with
their
right
to
exclude.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
it
is
our
position
that
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
terminate
the
reservation
as
an
indian
reservation
and
to
terminate
the
status
of
the
tribe
as
indians.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
correct.
a
--
the
owner
of
the
land
could
exclude
persons
from
trespassing
as
any
other
citizen
would
have
the
same
right
to
do.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
no,
you
can't.
you
can
float
down
the
creek
and
--
or
walk
down
the
banks
of
the
creek
to
get
there,
but
you
can't
cross
his
land
to
get
to
the
creek.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
it
is
in
ours.
in
any
event,
our
position
is
that
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
briefly
conclude
the
state's
discussion
of
the
legal
points
that
are
in
issue
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
argue
again
based
on
legislative
history
in
interpreting
the
menominee
termination
act
that
public
law
280,
which
conferred
jurisdiction
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
over
the
menominee
indians
for
purposes
of
civil
and
--
and
criminal
matters
but
contained
a
specific
reservation
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
this
law
became
law
about
a
month
after
the
menominee
termination
act
was
passed
and
the
petitioners
contend
that
this
was
--
that
the
concurrent
consideration
by
the
same
congress
of
these
two
acts
made
it
unnecessary
to
specifically
reserve
hunting
and
fishing
rights
when
it
passed
the
menominee
termination
act
because
it
was
contained
in
public
law
280,
which
was
passed
by
the
same
congress
a
month
later.
i
would
merely
say
in
response
to
the
argument,
which
--
which
is
in
our
position
set
forth
more
fully
in
the
briefs,
is
that
in
the
volumes
and
volumes
of
testimony
that
pertained
to
all
the
termination
acts
that
were
considered
at
the
same
time,
there
was
not
one
single
reference
to
public
law
280,
and
the
only
reference
to
public
law
280
in
so
far
as
the
menominee
indians
are
concerned
comes
about
some
seven
years
later
in
the
language
of
the
plan
which
was
drafted
by
the
--
and
submitted
by
the
indians
pursuant
to
the
original
act.
and
certainly,
something
which
take
place
--
takes
place
seven
years
later
cannot
possibly
be
considered
as
part
of
the
legislative
history
on
the
original
termination
act.
and
furthermore
on
this
point,
i
would
like
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
original
state
supreme
court
decision
was
handed
down
in
1963,
the
sanapaw
case
which
held
at
the
termination
act
did
cut
off
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
that
following
the
decision
our
state
supreme
court
in
the
sanapaw
case,
we
had
five
years
in
which
the
congress
could
have
acted
had
it
disagreed
with
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
sanapaw
case.
and
in
fact,
the
menominee
termination
act
was
amended
by
the
congress
in
1966
and
there
was
no
effort
by
the
congress
made
at
that
time
to
overrule
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
in
the
sanapaw
case.
this
point
is
not
covered
in
our
brief
and
i
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention.
as
an
additional
argument,
which
supports
the
position
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
that
the
sanapaw
decision
was
concurred
in
by
silence,
by
congress,
and
the
only
inference
that
can
be
gained
if
any
from
that
silence
is
that
they
concurred
in
the
decision
of
our
court.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
subsequent
amendment
in
1966
was
an
amendment
to
provide
for
federal
moneys
to
be
paid
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
reimburse
the
state
for
unforeseen
expenses
that
had
accrued
to
the
state
as
a
result
of
the
termination,
and
provided
mainly
for
expenditures,
for
educational
needs
and
welfare
needs
of
the
indians
on
the
reservation.
we
also
contend,
and
it's
set
forth
fully
in
our
brief,
that
petitioners
rely
on
klamath
cases
is
misplaced,
and
that
in
fact,
the
klamath
case
supports
the
position
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
first
of
all,
i
think
we
have
to
distinguish
the
klamath
case.
the
case
had
an
entirely
different
termination
act.
there,
the
indians
were
given
an
option
of
either
remaining
on
the
tribe,
on
the
reservation
as
a
continuing
member
of
a
--
of
the
tribe,
or
to
terminate
and
they
had
an
actual
election.
those
who
voted
to
terminate,
the
land
was
sold
and
actual
moneys
were
paid
to
those
who
elected
to
terminate,
some
$40,000.00
a
piece.
those
who
elected
to
remain
on
the
reservation
the
proportionate
amount
of
land
was
continued
as
a
reservation.
the
question
before
the
court
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
the
klamath
tribe,
those
members
of
the
tribe
who
elected
to
remain
on
the
reservation,
whether
their
rights
to
hunt
on
the
land
that
was
formerly
on
the
klamath
reservation
but
had
been
sold
and
put
in
trust
and
became
a
national
forest,
whether
their
hunting
rights
acquired
under
their
treaty
survived
this
termination
and
this
transfer
on
the
old
lands
that
were
on
the
reservation.
the
court
held
no,
they
didn't
survive
and
that
even
though
they
were
given
under
a
treaty,
they
didn't
survive
the
transfer
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
they
were.
they
were
compensated
fully
when
they
elected
to
terminate
because
they
were
paid
proportionate
share
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
in
essence,
this
is
the
position
of
the
state
on
the
cases
and
the
legislative
history,
which
is
applicable
here.
but
we
feel
that
this
abstract
legal
arguments
are
of
--
are
of
legal
guidance
to
this
court
in
reaching
the
right
result
in
this
particular
case.
and
in
our
view,
the
other
factors
are
--
are
much
more
important.
and
first
of
all,
i
think
that
considering
this
case,
we
have
to
--
and
in
considering
the
prior
cases
that
dealt
with
this
question
and
the
legislative
history,
you
have
to
realize
that
the
menominee
indian
treaty
is
different
from
any
other
treaty
that
is
raised
in
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs.
and
first
of
all,
it's
different
because
it
is
a
grant
from
the
united
states
and
not
a
ceding
by
the
indians.
in
other
words,
this
is
new
land
that
was
given
to
the
menominee
tribe
that
they
had
not
had
any
aboriginal
claim
of
title
to
or
of
right
to
or
of
any
other.
and
therefore,
when
the
court
--
when
the
treaty
was
entered
into
and
which
it
declared
that
these
are
to
be
--
these
lands
are
given
to
the
indians
as
a
home
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held,
this
was
a
grant
to
the
indians.
and
in
the
other
treaties
wherein
the
land
was
their
aboriginal
land
and
the
treaty
was
entered
into,
there
was
always
the
reasoning
going
through
the
decisions
that
the
treaty
rights
were
a
session
from
the
indians
of
--
of
rights
that
they
already
have
and
a
reservation
of
those
rights
that
were
not
mentioned.
i
will
--
i
merely
raise
this
point
because
i
think
that
it
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
the
--
in
studying
and
analyzing
these
cases.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
they
do.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
it
was.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
in
the
other
cases
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
in
the
other
cases,
the
court
has
always
held
in
interpreting
the
treaties
and
the
provisions
applicable.
wherever
there
was
silence
in
so
far
as
the
treaty
itself
was
concerned
on
these
points
that
it
was
understood
by
the
indians
that
they
always
had
these
rights
and
therefore,
there
was
no
need
to
mention
them.
and
it
was
not
a
granting
away
of
any
rights.
it
was
a
reservation
of
those
rights
which
were
not
specifically
mentioned.
i
think
it
--
it
very
well
could
be
argued
that
this
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
but
i
merely
raise
it
for
the
court's
attention.
our
position
is
in
the
facts
bear
this
out,
that
the
lands
are
no
longer
in
fact
held
as
indian
lands
are
held.
and
therefore,
whatever
rights
that
the
indians
got
under
the
original
treaty,
when
the
land
was
given
them
by
the
united
states
in
1854,
are
now
extinguished
because
we
feel
that
this
treaty
has
to
be
construed
in
the
light
of
the
language
that
was
used
and
in
the
conditions
that
existed
at
the
time.
and
this
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
at
the
time
that
they
passed
this
particular
termination
act,
however
wrong
they
might
have
been
by
hindsight
from
a
policy
standpoint.
and
another
point
i
would
mention
here
is
again
relating
to
the
klamath
termination
act.
when
the
klamath
termination
act
was
passed,
there
was
a
specific
reservation
of
rights.
and
so,
i
think
that
the
failure
to
reserve
rights
in
this
case
was
a
specific
congress
--
events
--
a
specific
congressional
intent
that
termination
should
be
absolute.
not
on
--
not
only
are
the
lands
no
longer
held
as
indian
lands
are
held
in
this
particular
case,
but
the
indians
no
longer
live
as
a
tribe
--
as
a
tribe
of
indians.
for
over
a
hundred
years
prior
to
termination,
the
menominees
lived
under
tribal
government
supplemented
by
the
federal
agency
supervision.
they
had
their
own
law
enforcement,
they
had
their
own
judicial
powers,
all
of
the
land
itself
was
held
in
common.
there
was
no
individual
ownership.
and
these
are
the
essential
characteristics
of
an
indian
tribe.
since
termination
and
consistent
with
the
clear
policy
of
the
congress,
wisconsin
acting
in
concert
with
the
indians
and
with
the
federal
government
turned
the
land
into
a
duly
organized
and
fully-fledged
county
of
the
sovereign
state
of
wisconsin.
the
reservation
is
now
a
county.
it
forms
a
72nd
county
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
it
is
governed
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
they
--
they
didn't
get
anything
yet.
that's
what
they
were
suing
for
in
the
court
of
claims,
for
compensation
for
the
termination
of
these
rights,
and
we
contend
that
their
position
was
correct
before
the
court
of
claims
and
that
the
federal
government
should
compensate
them.
that
is
our
position.
they
haven't
yet
received
any
compensation
for
this.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
they
never
have.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
congress
knew
of
other
indian
tribes
that
had
been
terminated
and
which
had
sued
for
compensation
before
the
court
of
claims,
and
i
suppose
that
it
felt
that
this
was
a
matter
for
judicial
determination
rather
than
for
congressional
determination.
in
any
event
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
absolutely.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
we
do.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
we
do.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
by
passage
of
the
termination
act,
congress
--
the
policy
of
the
congress
at
that
time
was
to
fully
assimilate
all
indian
--
indians
into
complete
citizenship
along
with
every
other
citizen
of
the
united
states.
and
that
consistent
with
that
policy,
these
acts
were
taken
by
the
state
of
wisconsin
pursuant
to
this
termination
act.
and
we
feel
that
the
question
really
involves
this
--
this
whole
policy
of
congress
and
whether
or
not
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
indians
became
citizens
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
now,
i'm
not
so
sure
i've
responded
to
your
question.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
the
--
going
back
a
little
bit
of
the
history
of
the
first
passage
of
it
--
not
the
passage
but
the
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
indians
to
terminate
was
a
conditional
agreement.
as
was
mentioned
by
the
petitioner
in
oral
argument,
the
united
states
owed
some
$8
million
or
$9
million
to
the
indians
for
mismanagement
of
their
tribal
property
and
they
wanted
to
receive
compensation.
and
as
a
condition
to
receive
this
compensation,
they
--
the
congress
told
them
you
have
to
terminate
in
order
to
get
this
compensation.
so
under
those
conditions,
that
is
how
the
indians
--
and
they
took
a
vote
to
terminate,
and
then
the
indians
agreed
that
they
would
terminate
so
that
they
could
acquire
this
$8
million
or
$9
million,
which
was
due
and
owing
for
the
united
states.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
right.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
right.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
and
that
was
done
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
correct.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
it
did
happen
afterwards,
yes.
in
any
event,
our
position
is
that
all
the
characteristics
of
an
indian
tribe
that
of
self
government,
and
of
--
and
of
owning
--
ownership
of
communal
property,
and
the
maintenance
of
a
--
of
a
reservation
are
no
longer
in
fact
in
existence.
in
fact,
there
are
over
500
individually
owned
home
sites
and
farmlands
owned
by
individuals
within
the
confines
of
the
reservation.
now
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
they're
--
they
are
indians.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
they
are
indians
but
there's
no
restriction
as
to
ownership
of
that
land,
or
if
there
is,
it
is
--
it
is
about
to
expire.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
--
to
the
united
states
and
to
the
petitioners,
i
think
what
they're
asking
this
court
to
do
without
saying
so
in
so
many
words
is
to
declare
what
the
policy
of
the
united
states
toward
these
indians
ought
to
be
now,
not
what
the
congress
intended
at
the
time
that
it
passed
the
termination
act.
and
we
submit
that
such
an
interpretation
will
frustrate
the
obvious
intent
of
the
congress
in
passing
this
act
in
the
first
place.
and
furthermore,
we
contend
that
should
the
court
disagree
with
our
position
in
this
case
and
decide
that
these
rights
do
survive
that
this
will
lead
to
an
absurd
result.
in
the
petitioners'
brief,
they
argue
that
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
survived
in
this
tribal
corporation,
not
the
menominee
enterprises
incorporated
with
to
which
the
federal
government
transferred
all
of
the
lands,
but
the
tribal
corporation
which
was
set
up
over
a
year
or
approximately
a
year
after
termination
became
final,
and
--
which
is
a
--
a
non-stock
corporation
organized
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
whose
membership
is
open
to
anyone.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
right.
(voice
overlap)
1961,
and
that
was
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
right.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yeah.
it
went
into
effect
at
the
time
that
the
plan
was
approved.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
i
was
quite
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
and
this
is
where
we
have
had
some
difficulty
in
this
case
because
at
the
time
we
first
filed
our
brief,
we
had
no
knowledge
that
the
indians
have
changed
their
position
that
they
maintained
before
the
court
of
claims.
and
at
--
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
he
maintains
there
and
so
does
the
united
states
that
these
rights
survived
in
this
non-profit
corporation.
and
on
oral
argument,
he
now
contends
that
they
survived
in
the
individual
indians
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
in
the
tribe.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
members
of
the
tribe.
so
really,
we
--
we
really
don't
know
how
respond
to
these
points
because
they
seem
to
be
changing
quite
a
bit,
but
we
would
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
whether
or
not
they
survive
in
the
non-profit
corporation
which
is
open
to
non-indians,
or
whether
they
survive
in
the
so-called
tribe,
which
we
contend
really
doesn't
exist
anymore,
but
if
they
do
--
if
they
are
held
by
this
court
to
survive
in
the
tribe,
then
the
rights
which
they
do
have
in
the
--
and
to
whomsoever
they
survive
to
control
the
hunting
and
fishing
regulations
within
the
confines
of
a
duly
organized
country
of
the
sovereign
state
of
wisconsin
is
an
attribute
of
sovereignty.
wisconsin
was
one
of
the
states
in
the
northwest
territory
and
as
such,
when
we
became
a
state,
we
acquired
all
of
the
--
the
state
of
wisconsin
acquired
the
interest
in
the
fish
and
game
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
its
citizens.
and
we
acquire
our
sovereignty
extended
to
the
lands
in
question
here
fully
and
compete
before
this
was
ever
a
menominee
indian
reservation
because
we
became
a
state
in
1848
and
our
constitution
did
not
contain
a
disclaimer
over
indian
jurisdiction
as
other
state
constitutions
did.
therefore,
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
which
include
the
regulation
of
hunting
and
fishing
in
--
and
held
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
our
citizens
attached
to
the
lands
here
in
question
before
this
ever
became
an
indian
reservation.
when
it
became
an
indian
reservation,
in
effect,
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
somehow
limited
because
in
so
far
as
the
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
indians
was
concerned
that
law
was
the
supreme
law
that
governed,
and
we
did
not
have
the
power
to
enforce
our
indi
--
our
hunting
and
fishing
laws
on
that
reservation.
we
contend
that
the
granting
of
this
power
at
the
present
time
over
these
lands
to
a
private
corporation
or
to
a
unde
--
almost
indefinable
nebulous
group
of
--
known
as
the
tribe,
whatever
it
--
however
it
survives
today
as
a
legal
entity
is
in
effect
transferring
an
attribute
of
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
a
private
entity.
and
if
it's
transferred
to
this
private
corporation,
it
is
transferring
power
to
the
corporation
which
is
subject
to
the
powers
and
the
laws
and
the
authority
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
which
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
not
given
to
a
private
corporation.
and
if
--
if
it
transfers,
to
a
tribe,
we
respectfully
ask
the
guidance
of
this
court
as
to
how
the
state
of
wisconsin
can
enforce
its
hunting
and
fishing
laws
with
respect
to
these
lands
and
with
respect
to
the
indians
in
question.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
if
the
plan
had
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
we
--
contend
that
--
that
what
we
have
to
look
to
is
what
actually
happened.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
and
i
don't
know
if
i
would
be
in
a
position
to
express
an
opinion
on
what
our
position
would
be
if
that
had
actually
been
incorporated
into
the
plan.
we'd
certainly
reject
the
contention
made
by
the
petitioners
that
the
reference
and
the
plan
to
law
and
order
con
--
was
sufficient
to
include
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
there
certainly
is
no
basis
for
that
holding.
in
the
--
in
summary,
i
should
--
i
should
like
to
discuss
one
--
one
more
case,
going
back
to
the
legal
issue
again,
which
is
relied
on
by
the
petitioners,
and
that
is
the
winans
case.
certainly,
we
reject
any
notion
that
this
case
is
authority
for
the
proposition
that
these
rights
survived
in
the
menominee
indian
case
because
that
treaty
was
different.
that
treaty
contemplated
the
ownership
of
the
land
by
private
persons
because
that
treaty
gave
those
indians
the
rights
to
hunt
in
the
usual
and
accustomed
--
customary
places
and
to
the
same
ext
--
along
with
the
white
settlers.
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
to
--
to
rule
in
any
other
--
any
other
way
would
be
a
tantamount
to
a
ruling
that
the
treaty
was
meaningless
and
it
didn't
grant
them
any
rights
at
all.
and
certainly,
that
case
we
feel
is
distinguishable
from
ours
on
that
ground.
this
is
a
case
in
our
view
a
first
impression
and
this
court
is
bound
by
no
president
for
none
is
controlling.
the
court,
in
seeking
to
implement
the
intent
of
congress,
when
passing
the
silent
version
of
the
termination
act
should
be
mindful
of
the
diff
--
difficulties
created
for
the
state
of
wisconsin
if
these
rights
do
survive.
the
court
should
also
bear
in
mind
that
it
may
easily
accommodate
the
position
of
the
indians
in
this
case
as
stated
before
the
court
of
claims
by
reversing
that
court
and
holding
that
the
indians
are
entitled
to
compensation
for
the
loss
of
their
valuable
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
hold
that
these
rights
do
survive,
wisconsin
respectfully
asks
the
guidance
of
the
court
in
the
administration
of
its
duty
under
the
trust
doctrine
to
protect
the
fishing
game
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
our
citizens.
in
fact,
that
is
our
position
and
we
respectfully
request
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that
is
correct.
they
do
not
arise
in
this
case
or
not
before
this
court
but
we
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
i'm
sure
that
we
would
have
to
carefully
determine
how,
in
--
in
light
of
the
court's
opinion
how
we
would
enforce
our
game
laws.
well,
we
have
no
idea
what
the
court
may
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
we
are.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
no,
we're
not.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
correct.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
it
is.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
i'm
bronson
lafollette,
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
appearing
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
as
amicus
curiae
at
the
invitation
of
this
court.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
state
appears
here
as
amicus
curiae
and
has
a
--
a
very
keen
interest
in
the
resolution
of
the
issues
presented
by
this
case
because
the
issues
raised
in
this
case
have
a
direct
and
immediate
impact
on
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
protect
and
conserve
the
wildlife
hab
--
habitat,
which
it
holds
in
trust
for
all
of
its
citizens,
and
also
because
it
will
have
a
direct
and
immediate
impact
upon
the
citizens
of
wisconsin
residing
in
menominee
county,
this
court
is
fully
aware
of
the
facts
of
this
case
at
having
been
argued
previously
and
having
been
before
the
court
at
an
earlier
date.
and
the
legal
position
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
fully
set
forth
in
the
briefs,
and
i
won't
go
into
it
in
great
detail,
but
so
that
the
court
is
absolutely
clear,
i
would
refer
to
it
briefly.
first
of
all,
wisconsin
contends
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
of
the
menominee
tribe
were
acquired
under
the
treaty
of
1854.
we
contend
that
these
rights
were
cut
off
by
the
1954
menominee
termination
act
and
the
events
which
have
taken
place
subsequent
to
and
pursuant
to
that
act.
and
we
further
contend
that
the
cutting
off
of
these
viable
rights
was
an
act
for
which
compensation
is
due
and
owing
the
menominee
indians
by
the
federal
government.
first
of
all,
the
plain
language
of
the
termination
act
itself
in
our
view
events
as
an
intent
to
end
the
tribal
status
of
the
menominee
indians.
by
looking
at
the
very
words
of
the
act
itself,
the
language
is
clear
in
section
899.
it
says
that
the
menominees
will
not
be
entitled
to
any
of
the
services
performed
by
the
united
states
for
indians
because
of
their
status
as
indians
and
further,
that
the
laws
of
the
several
states
shall
apply
in
the
same
manner
as
to
other
citizens.
we
can
glean
an
indication
of
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
these
termination
acts
by
the
house
concurrent
congressional
resolution
108
which
says
that
the
purpose
of
termination
is
to
make
indians
subject
to
the
same
laws
as
other
citizens
and
assume
full
responsibility
as
citizens,
and
to
turn
over
the
federal
government's
trusteeship
to
a
responsible
indian
people.
the
menominee
termination
act
is
silent
as
to
the
question
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
in
our
view,
the
legislative
history,
which
is
cited
by
the
petitioner
at
the
very
best
is
inconclusive
on
this
point
and
certainly
does
not
support
the
contention
of
a
peti
--
of
the
petitioners.
first
of
all,
as
to
the
testimony
that
was
presented
to
the
committee
which
consider
--
was
considering,
the
termina
--
the
menominee
termination
act,
the
tribe's
own
attorney,
mr.
wilkinson
on
this
very
point
testified
that
the
passage
of
the
act
in
its
--in
the
form
then
being
considered
by
the
congress
would
have
the
effect
of
cutting
off
the
indians'
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
and
this
is
set
forth
fully
in
the
briefs.
furthermore,
this
was
not
the
only
version
of
the
termination
act
which
was
before
the
congress
at
this
particular
time.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
not
as
ordinary
other
citizens
if
they
conform
to
the
regulations
of
the
state.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
no,
they
could
not.
this
was
not
the
testimony
of
mr.
wilkinson
who
i
was
referring
to
when
i
made
this
point.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
correct.
mr.
wilkinson
testified
that
the
version
of
the
menominee
termination
act
which
finally
passed
the
congress
would
have
the
effect
of
cutting
off
the
treaty
rights
of
the
menominee
indians.
it's
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
i
do.
i
--
i
will
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
i
--
i
hope
to
have
the
court
understand
it
as
well.
in
addition
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
he
was
testifying
and
i
was
just
about
to
get
to
this
point.
he
was
testifying
in
favor
of
two
other
bills,
which
also
had
been
presented
at
the
specific
request
of
the
tribe,
which
would
have
specifically
preserved
hunting
and
fishing
rights
for
the
menominee
tribe.
and
--
but
--
but
congress,
in
view
of
this
conflicting
testimony
and
this
specific
testimony
of
the
counsel
for
the
tribe
that
the
version
that
finally
passed
which
was
silent
would
have
the
effect
of
cutting
off
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
chose
to
pass
the
silent
version.
and
we
contend
that
at
best,
the
legislative
history
is
inconclusive
and
all
it
shows
is
that
congress
had
two
versions
before
it,
one
which
specifically
reserved
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
and
the
one
which
finally
passed
which
was
silent.
and
therefore,
the
congress
passed
the
sil
--
with
--
with
this
testimony
before
the
congress
passed
the
silent
version.
and
if
anything,
we
contend
that
this
supports
our
position
that
these
rights
were
cut
off
because
if
they
were
to
have
any
specific
rights
beyond
ordinary
citizenship,
they
should
have
been
spelled
out
by
the
congress.
this
is
exactly
what
the
congress
did.
in
the
claimant
--
yes?
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
i
think
that
that
latter
point
is
resolved
by
the
body
of
law
which
says
that
the
rights
that
accrue
to
the
indian
tribe
under
all
treaties
is
subject
to
being
altered
or
amended
in
any
way
by
an
act
of
the
congress.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
it
would.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
all
we're
asking.
we
make
these
other
points
because
of
the
arguments
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
if
--
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
rights
which
they
acquired
under
the
treaty
were
exclusive
rights
and
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
these
exclusive
rights
were
now
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
they
could
only
exercise
these
rights
in
conformity
with
state
law,
then
of
course
the
federal
government
have
to
compensate
the
indians
for
the
loss
of
their
exclusive
rights.
but
we
are
contending
for
no
more
than
the
right
to
apply
our
hunting
and
fishing
laws
to
the
citizens
of
menominee
county
in
the
same
manner
that
they
apply
to
other
citizens
of
the
state.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
our
position
that
the
federal
government
terminated
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
be
inconsistent
with
their
right
to
exclude.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
it
is
our
position
that
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
terminate
the
reservation
as
an
indian
reservation
and
to
terminate
the
status
of
the
tribe
as
indians.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
correct.
a
--
the
owner
of
the
land
could
exclude
persons
from
trespassing
as
any
other
citizen
would
have
the
same
right
to
do.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
no,
you
can't.
you
can
float
down
the
creek
and
--
or
walk
down
the
banks
of
the
creek
to
get
there,
but
you
can't
cross
his
land
to
get
to
the
creek.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
it
is
in
ours.
in
any
event,
our
position
is
that
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
briefly
conclude
the
state's
discussion
of
the
legal
points
that
are
in
issue
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
argue
again
based
on
legislative
history
in
interpreting
the
menominee
termination
act
that
public
law
280,
which
conferred
jurisdiction
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
over
the
menominee
indians
for
purposes
of
civil
and
--
and
criminal
matters
but
contained
a
specific
reservation
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
this
law
became
law
about
a
month
after
the
menominee
termination
act
was
passed
and
the
petitioners
contend
that
this
was
--
that
the
concurrent
consideration
by
the
same
congress
of
these
two
acts
made
it
unnecessary
to
specifically
reserve
hunting
and
fishing
rights
when
it
passed
the
menominee
termination
act
because
it
was
contained
in
public
law
280,
which
was
passed
by
the
same
congress
a
month
later.
i
would
merely
say
in
response
to
the
argument,
which
--
which
is
in
our
position
set
forth
more
fully
in
the
briefs,
is
that
in
the
volumes
and
volumes
of
testimony
that
pertained
to
all
the
termination
acts
that
were
considered
at
the
same
time,
there
was
not
one
single
reference
to
public
law
280,
and
the
only
reference
to
public
law
280
in
so
far
as
the
menominee
indians
are
concerned
comes
about
some
seven
years
later
in
the
language
of
the
plan
which
was
drafted
by
the
--
and
submitted
by
the
indians
pursuant
to
the
original
act.
and
certainly,
something
which
take
place
--
takes
place
seven
years
later
cannot
possibly
be
considered
as
part
of
the
legislative
history
on
the
original
termination
act.
and
furthermore
on
this
point,
i
would
like
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
original
state
supreme
court
decision
was
handed
down
in
1963,
the
sanapaw
case
which
held
at
the
termination
act
did
cut
off
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
that
following
the
decision
our
state
supreme
court
in
the
sanapaw
case,
we
had
five
years
in
which
the
congress
could
have
acted
had
it
disagreed
with
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
sanapaw
case.
and
in
fact,
the
menominee
termination
act
was
amended
by
the
congress
in
1966
and
there
was
no
effort
by
the
congress
made
at
that
time
to
overrule
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
in
the
sanapaw
case.
this
point
is
not
covered
in
our
brief
and
i
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention.
as
an
additional
argument,
which
supports
the
position
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
that
the
sanapaw
decision
was
concurred
in
by
silence,
by
congress,
and
the
only
inference
that
can
be
gained
if
any
from
that
silence
is
that
they
concurred
in
the
decision
of
our
court.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
subsequent
amendment
in
1966
was
an
amendment
to
provide
for
federal
moneys
to
be
paid
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
reimburse
the
state
for
unforeseen
expenses
that
had
accrued
to
the
state
as
a
result
of
the
termination,
and
provided
mainly
for
expenditures,
for
educational
needs
and
welfare
needs
of
the
indians
on
the
reservation.
we
also
contend,
and
it's
set
forth
fully
in
our
brief,
that
petitioners
rely
on
klamath
cases
is
misplaced,
and
that
in
fact,
the
klamath
case
supports
the
position
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
first
of
all,
i
think
we
have
to
distinguish
the
klamath
case.
the
case
had
an
entirely
different
termination
act.
there,
the
indians
were
given
an
option
of
either
remaining
on
the
tribe,
on
the
reservation
as
a
continuing
member
of
a
--
of
the
tribe,
or
to
terminate
and
they
had
an
actual
election.
those
who
voted
to
terminate,
the
land
was
sold
and
actual
moneys
were
paid
to
those
who
elected
to
terminate,
some
$40,000.00
a
piece.
those
who
elected
to
remain
on
the
reservation
the
proportionate
amount
of
land
was
continued
as
a
reservation.
the
question
before
the
court
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
the
klamath
tribe,
those
members
of
the
tribe
who
elected
to
remain
on
the
reservation,
whether
their
rights
to
hunt
on
the
land
that
was
formerly
on
the
klamath
reservation
but
had
been
sold
and
put
in
trust
and
became
a
national
forest,
whether
their
hunting
rights
acquired
under
their
treaty
survived
this
termination
and
this
transfer
on
the
old
lands
that
were
on
the
reservation.
the
court
held
no,
they
didn't
survive
and
that
even
though
they
were
given
under
a
treaty,
they
didn't
survive
the
transfer
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
they
were.
they
were
compensated
fully
when
they
elected
to
terminate
because
they
were
paid
proportionate
share
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
in
essence,
this
is
the
position
of
the
state
on
the
cases
and
the
legislative
history,
which
is
applicable
here.
but
we
feel
that
this
abstract
legal
arguments
are
of
--
are
of
legal
guidance
to
this
court
in
reaching
the
right
result
in
this
particular
case.
and
in
our
view,
the
other
factors
are
--
are
much
more
important.
and
first
of
all,
i
think
that
considering
this
case,
we
have
to
--
and
in
considering
the
prior
cases
that
dealt
with
this
question
and
the
legislative
history,
you
have
to
realize
that
the
menominee
indian
treaty
is
different
from
any
other
treaty
that
is
raised
in
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs.
and
first
of
all,
it's
different
because
it
is
a
grant
from
the
united
states
and
not
a
ceding
by
the
indians.
in
other
words,
this
is
new
land
that
was
given
to
the
menominee
tribe
that
they
had
not
had
any
aboriginal
claim
of
title
to
or
of
right
to
or
of
any
other.
and
therefore,
when
the
court
--
when
the
treaty
was
entered
into
and
which
it
declared
that
these
are
to
be
--
these
lands
are
given
to
the
indians
as
a
home
to
be
held
as
indian
lands
are
held,
this
was
a
grant
to
the
indians.
and
in
the
other
treaties
wherein
the
land
was
their
aboriginal
land
and
the
treaty
was
entered
into,
there
was
always
the
reasoning
going
through
the
decisions
that
the
treaty
rights
were
a
session
from
the
indians
of
--
of
rights
that
they
already
have
and
a
reservation
of
those
rights
that
were
not
mentioned.
i
will
--
i
merely
raise
this
point
because
i
think
that
it
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
the
--
in
studying
and
analyzing
these
cases.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
they
do.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
it
was.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
in
the
other
cases
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
in
the
other
cases,
the
court
has
always
held
in
interpreting
the
treaties
and
the
provisions
applicable.
wherever
there
was
silence
in
so
far
as
the
treaty
itself
was
concerned
on
these
points
that
it
was
understood
by
the
indians
that
they
always
had
these
rights
and
therefore,
there
was
no
need
to
mention
them.
and
it
was
not
a
granting
away
of
any
rights.
it
was
a
reservation
of
those
rights
which
were
not
specifically
mentioned.
i
think
it
--
it
very
well
could
be
argued
that
this
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
but
i
merely
raise
it
for
the
court's
attention.
our
position
is
in
the
facts
bear
this
out,
that
the
lands
are
no
longer
in
fact
held
as
indian
lands
are
held.
and
therefore,
whatever
rights
that
the
indians
got
under
the
original
treaty,
when
the
land
was
given
them
by
the
united
states
in
1854,
are
now
extinguished
because
we
feel
that
this
treaty
has
to
be
construed
in
the
light
of
the
language
that
was
used
and
in
the
conditions
that
existed
at
the
time.
and
this
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
at
the
time
that
they
passed
this
particular
termination
act,
however
wrong
they
might
have
been
by
hindsight
from
a
policy
standpoint.
and
another
point
i
would
mention
here
is
again
relating
to
the
klamath
termination
act.
when
the
klamath
termination
act
was
passed,
there
was
a
specific
reservation
of
rights.
and
so,
i
think
that
the
failure
to
reserve
rights
in
this
case
was
a
specific
congress
--
events
--
a
specific
congressional
intent
that
termination
should
be
absolute.
not
on
--
not
only
are
the
lands
no
longer
held
as
indian
lands
are
held
in
this
particular
case,
but
the
indians
no
longer
live
as
a
tribe
--
as
a
tribe
of
indians.
for
over
a
hundred
years
prior
to
termination,
the
menominees
lived
under
tribal
government
supplemented
by
the
federal
agency
supervision.
they
had
their
own
law
enforcement,
they
had
their
own
judicial
powers,
all
of
the
land
itself
was
held
in
common.
there
was
no
individual
ownership.
and
these
are
the
essential
characteristics
of
an
indian
tribe.
since
termination
and
consistent
with
the
clear
policy
of
the
congress,
wisconsin
acting
in
concert
with
the
indians
and
with
the
federal
government
turned
the
land
into
a
duly
organized
and
fully-fledged
county
of
the
sovereign
state
of
wisconsin.
the
reservation
is
now
a
county.
it
forms
a
72nd
county
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
it
is
governed
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
they
--
they
didn't
get
anything
yet.
that's
what
they
were
suing
for
in
the
court
of
claims,
for
compensation
for
the
termination
of
these
rights,
and
we
contend
that
their
position
was
correct
before
the
court
of
claims
and
that
the
federal
government
should
compensate
them.
that
is
our
position.
they
haven't
yet
received
any
compensation
for
this.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
they
never
have.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
congress
knew
of
other
indian
tribes
that
had
been
terminated
and
which
had
sued
for
compensation
before
the
court
of
claims,
and
i
suppose
that
it
felt
that
this
was
a
matter
for
judicial
determination
rather
than
for
congressional
determination.
in
any
event
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
absolutely.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
we
do.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
we
do.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
by
passage
of
the
termination
act,
congress
--
the
policy
of
the
congress
at
that
time
was
to
fully
assimilate
all
indian
--
indians
into
complete
citizenship
along
with
every
other
citizen
of
the
united
states.
and
that
consistent
with
that
policy,
these
acts
were
taken
by
the
state
of
wisconsin
pursuant
to
this
termination
act.
and
we
feel
that
the
question
really
involves
this
--
this
whole
policy
of
congress
and
whether
or
not
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
indians
became
citizens
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
now,
i'm
not
so
sure
i've
responded
to
your
question.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
the
--
going
back
a
little
bit
of
the
history
of
the
first
passage
of
it
--
not
the
passage
but
the
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
indians
to
terminate
was
a
conditional
agreement.
as
was
mentioned
by
the
petitioner
in
oral
argument,
the
united
states
owed
some
$8
million
or
$9
million
to
the
indians
for
mismanagement
of
their
tribal
property
and
they
wanted
to
receive
compensation.
and
as
a
condition
to
receive
this
compensation,
they
--
the
congress
told
them
you
have
to
terminate
in
order
to
get
this
compensation.
so
under
those
conditions,
that
is
how
the
indians
--
and
they
took
a
vote
to
terminate,
and
then
the
indians
agreed
that
they
would
terminate
so
that
they
could
acquire
this
$8
million
or
$9
million,
which
was
due
and
owing
for
the
united
states.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
right.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
right.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
and
that
was
done
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
correct.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
it
did
happen
afterwards,
yes.
in
any
event,
our
position
is
that
all
the
characteristics
of
an
indian
tribe
that
of
self
government,
and
of
--
and
of
owning
--
ownership
of
communal
property,
and
the
maintenance
of
a
--
of
a
reservation
are
no
longer
in
fact
in
existence.
in
fact,
there
are
over
500
individually
owned
home
sites
and
farmlands
owned
by
individuals
within
the
confines
of
the
reservation.
now
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
they're
--
they
are
indians.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
they
are
indians
but
there's
no
restriction
as
to
ownership
of
that
land,
or
if
there
is,
it
is
--
it
is
about
to
expire.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
--
to
the
united
states
and
to
the
petitioners,
i
think
what
they're
asking
this
court
to
do
without
saying
so
in
so
many
words
is
to
declare
what
the
policy
of
the
united
states
toward
these
indians
ought
to
be
now,
not
what
the
congress
intended
at
the
time
that
it
passed
the
termination
act.
and
we
submit
that
such
an
interpretation
will
frustrate
the
obvious
intent
of
the
congress
in
passing
this
act
in
the
first
place.
and
furthermore,
we
contend
that
should
the
court
disagree
with
our
position
in
this
case
and
decide
that
these
rights
do
survive
that
this
will
lead
to
an
absurd
result.
in
the
petitioners'
brief,
they
argue
that
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
survived
in
this
tribal
corporation,
not
the
menominee
enterprises
incorporated
with
to
which
the
federal
government
transferred
all
of
the
lands,
but
the
tribal
corporation
which
was
set
up
over
a
year
or
approximately
a
year
after
termination
became
final,
and
--
which
is
a
--
a
non-stock
corporation
organized
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
whose
membership
is
open
to
anyone.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
right.
(voice
overlap)
1961,
and
that
was
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
the
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
right.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yeah.
it
went
into
effect
at
the
time
that
the
plan
was
approved.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
i
was
quite
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
and
this
is
where
we
have
had
some
difficulty
in
this
case
because
at
the
time
we
first
filed
our
brief,
we
had
no
knowledge
that
the
indians
have
changed
their
position
that
they
maintained
before
the
court
of
claims.
and
at
--
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
he
maintains
there
and
so
does
the
united
states
that
these
rights
survived
in
this
non-profit
corporation.
and
on
oral
argument,
he
now
contends
that
they
survived
in
the
individual
indians
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
in
the
tribe.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
members
of
the
tribe.
so
really,
we
--
we
really
don't
know
how
respond
to
these
points
because
they
seem
to
be
changing
quite
a
bit,
but
we
would
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
whether
or
not
they
survive
in
the
non-profit
corporation
which
is
open
to
non-indians,
or
whether
they
survive
in
the
so-called
tribe,
which
we
contend
really
doesn't
exist
anymore,
but
if
they
do
--
if
they
are
held
by
this
court
to
survive
in
the
tribe,
then
the
rights
which
they
do
have
in
the
--
and
to
whomsoever
they
survive
to
control
the
hunting
and
fishing
regulations
within
the
confines
of
a
duly
organized
country
of
the
sovereign
state
of
wisconsin
is
an
attribute
of
sovereignty.
wisconsin
was
one
of
the
states
in
the
northwest
territory
and
as
such,
when
we
became
a
state,
we
acquired
all
of
the
--
the
state
of
wisconsin
acquired
the
interest
in
the
fish
and
game
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
its
citizens.
and
we
acquire
our
sovereignty
extended
to
the
lands
in
question
here
fully
and
compete
before
this
was
ever
a
menominee
indian
reservation
because
we
became
a
state
in
1848
and
our
constitution
did
not
contain
a
disclaimer
over
indian
jurisdiction
as
other
state
constitutions
did.
therefore,
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
which
include
the
regulation
of
hunting
and
fishing
in
--
and
held
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
our
citizens
attached
to
the
lands
here
in
question
before
this
ever
became
an
indian
reservation.
when
it
became
an
indian
reservation,
in
effect,
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
somehow
limited
because
in
so
far
as
the
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
indians
was
concerned
that
law
was
the
supreme
law
that
governed,
and
we
did
not
have
the
power
to
enforce
our
indi
--
our
hunting
and
fishing
laws
on
that
reservation.
we
contend
that
the
granting
of
this
power
at
the
present
time
over
these
lands
to
a
private
corporation
or
to
a
unde
--
almost
indefinable
nebulous
group
of
--
known
as
the
tribe,
whatever
it
--
however
it
survives
today
as
a
legal
entity
is
in
effect
transferring
an
attribute
of
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
a
private
entity.
and
if
it's
transferred
to
this
private
corporation,
it
is
transferring
power
to
the
corporation
which
is
subject
to
the
powers
and
the
laws
and
the
authority
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
which
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
not
given
to
a
private
corporation.
and
if
--
if
it
transfers,
to
a
tribe,
we
respectfully
ask
the
guidance
of
this
court
as
to
how
the
state
of
wisconsin
can
enforce
its
hunting
and
fishing
laws
with
respect
to
these
lands
and
with
respect
to
the
indians
in
question.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
if
the
plan
had
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
well,
we
--
contend
that
--
that
what
we
have
to
look
to
is
what
actually
happened.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
and
i
don't
know
if
i
would
be
in
a
position
to
express
an
opinion
on
what
our
position
would
be
if
that
had
actually
been
incorporated
into
the
plan.
we'd
certainly
reject
the
contention
made
by
the
petitioners
that
the
reference
and
the
plan
to
law
and
order
con
--
was
sufficient
to
include
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
there
certainly
is
no
basis
for
that
holding.
in
the
--
in
summary,
i
should
--
i
should
like
to
discuss
one
--
one
more
case,
going
back
to
the
legal
issue
again,
which
is
relied
on
by
the
petitioners,
and
that
is
the
winans
case.
certainly,
we
reject
any
notion
that
this
case
is
authority
for
the
proposition
that
these
rights
survived
in
the
menominee
indian
case
because
that
treaty
was
different.
that
treaty
contemplated
the
ownership
of
the
land
by
private
persons
because
that
treaty
gave
those
indians
the
rights
to
hunt
in
the
usual
and
accustomed
--
customary
places
and
to
the
same
ext
--
along
with
the
white
settlers.
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
to
--
to
rule
in
any
other
--
any
other
way
would
be
a
tantamount
to
a
ruling
that
the
treaty
was
meaningless
and
it
didn't
grant
them
any
rights
at
all.
and
certainly,
that
case
we
feel
is
distinguishable
from
ours
on
that
ground.
this
is
a
case
in
our
view
a
first
impression
and
this
court
is
bound
by
no
president
for
none
is
controlling.
the
court,
in
seeking
to
implement
the
intent
of
congress,
when
passing
the
silent
version
of
the
termination
act
should
be
mindful
of
the
diff
--
difficulties
created
for
the
state
of
wisconsin
if
these
rights
do
survive.
the
court
should
also
bear
in
mind
that
it
may
easily
accommodate
the
position
of
the
indians
in
this
case
as
stated
before
the
court
of
claims
by
reversing
that
court
and
holding
that
the
indians
are
entitled
to
compensation
for
the
loss
of
their
valuable
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
hold
that
these
rights
do
survive,
wisconsin
respectfully
asks
the
guidance
of
the
court
in
the
administration
of
its
duty
under
the
trust
doctrine
to
protect
the
fishing
game
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
our
citizens.
in
fact,
that
is
our
position
and
we
respectfully
request
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that
is
correct.
they
do
not
arise
in
this
case
or
not
before
this
court
but
we
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
i'm
sure
that
we
would
have
to
carefully
determine
how,
in
--
in
light
of
the
court's
opinion
how
we
would
enforce
our
game
laws.
well,
we
have
no
idea
what
the
court
may
--
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
we
are.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
no,
we're
not.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
that's
correct.
mr.
bronson
c.
lafollette
yes,
it
is.
