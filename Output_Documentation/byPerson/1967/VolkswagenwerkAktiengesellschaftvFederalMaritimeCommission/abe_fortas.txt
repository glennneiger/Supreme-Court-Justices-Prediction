justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
a
basic
agreement
as
your
--
are
you
telling
us
that
there's
a
basic
agreement
among
the
pma
members
with
respect
to
a
basic
charge
to
be
made
and
then
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
this
special
agreement
resulting
from
the
circumstances
of
the
agreement
with
the
unions.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
my
question
to
you
is
whether
the
logic
of
your
argument
would
not
require
that
the
basic
agreement
also
be
filed
under
section
15?
justice
abe
fortas
not
the
agreement
with
the
union
but
any
agreement
among
pma
members
with
respect
to
charges
to
be
made.
justice
abe
fortas
and
not
all
--
and
not
only
agreements
that
followed
the
agreement
with
the
union
of
which
you're
now
a
complaining.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
before
--
how
about
before?
was
there
anything
that
pma
did
before
the
agreement
with
the
union
which
you
think
ought
to
be
filed
with
the
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
had
he
--
(inaudible)
before
that
was
an
operating
organization,
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
collected
assessments
or
money
in
some
form
from
its
member,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
contention
that
that
basic
agreement
to
have
it
referred
to
as
a
basic
agreement,
does
or
does
not
have
to
be
filed
with
the
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
that's
what
bothers
me
because
what
i'm
really
asking
is
whether
the
logic
of
your
position
here
is
not
such
as
to
require
that
all
of
--
all
agreements
be
filed.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
--
and
you
not
say
--
telling
me
that
the
logic
of
your
argument
would
require
this
basic
agreement
to
be
filed
as
well
as
the
agreement
following
the
understanding
with
the

--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
that
it
is
de
minimis
and
therefore
can
the
--
they
can
be
excused
from
filing.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
you
will
not,
would
you
--
you
will
not
take
the
position
would
you
that
all
collective
bargaining
agreements
made
by
pma
have
to
be
filed
under
15?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
is
not
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
is
severable
from
the
collective
bargaining
arrangement
with
the
agreement.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
really
saying
as
i
understand
it
is
that
petitioner
here
must
concede
its
remedy
that
not

the
petitioner

not
a

or
within
the
protected
ambit

the
petitioner
here
had
available
to
him
through
it
an
antitrust
action

the

in
fact,
that

when
you
put
it

way,
i

with
that.
is
there
anything

i

is
there
anything
in

commission
opinion
that

that
a
commission's
decision
was

its

immunity
to

you're

to
us
now
that
it's
a
