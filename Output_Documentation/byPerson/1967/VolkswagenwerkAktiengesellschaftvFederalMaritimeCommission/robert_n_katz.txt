mr.
robert
n.
katz
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
excuse
me,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
this
juncture,
it
appears
abundantly
clear
that
there
is
some
confusion
as
to
the
impact
concerning
filing
or
non-filing
under
section
15
of
the
shipping
act.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
mr.
herzfeld
urges
that
the
commission
needs
some
guidelines
from
this
court
and
urges
that
the
commission
denied
them
their
day
in
court.
yet
he
is
urging
that
the
commission
be
given
even
broader
and
more
extensive
powers
than
the
commission
itself
has
ever
sought.
i
will
primarily
address
myself
to
consideration
of
the
question
of
the
impact
of
filing
or
non-filing
under
section
15.
mr.
torre
representing
pma
will
primarily
address
himself
to
clarify
in
the
confusion
which
the
petitioner
has
sought
to
create
by
obfuscation
of
the
facts
and
the
record
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
would
open
a
veritable
pandora's
box
if
the
interpretation
given
to
this
shipping
act
or
to
be
accepted
by
this
court
and
if
this
court
were
--
as
result
of
the
hearing
today
to
completely
reverse
the
wisdom
of
its
decision
in
the
case
of
carnation
company
versus
pacific
westbound
conference
cited
in
our
brief.
not
only
would
a
pandora's
box
be
opened
but
acceptance
of
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
shipping
act
would
completely
derogate
an
important
segment
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
we
know
why
volkswagen
is
in
this
court
today.
they
said
that
they're
in
the
court
challenging
the
position
of
the
commission
as
to
section
15.
they're
really
on
this
court
as
a
result
of
an
attempt
to
lower
their
price
by
persuading
their
supplier
to
remove
from
their
cost
base
a
segment
of
their
cost.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
why
is
the
united
state
here?
the
maritime
commission
here
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
he
is
speaking
for
the
united
states,
yes
sir.
the
maritime
commission
is
here
to
defend
the
decision
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
sir.
and
that
gets
the
point
that
i
was
going
to
bring
up
next.
we
can't
understand
why
the
department
of
justice
is
attempting
to
channel
to
an
independent
regulatory
agency
enforcement
of
antitrust
laws
in
the
area
of
the
maritime
industry
where
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
would
not
be
inimical
to
the
purposes
of
the
shipping
act.
now,
the
question
was
raised
earlier
by
i
believe
mr.
posner,
a
comment
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
shipping
act
1916.
the
purpose
of
that
act
was
not
necessarily
or
solely
to
bring
under
scrutiny
of
the
commission
the
activities
of
this
industry.
no,
it
was
instead
to
provide
a
system
for
granting
an
exemption
to
that
industry
coupled
with
surveillance.
now,
it's
not
the
position
of
this
court.
it
has
--
not
in
the
position
of
this
court
nor
the
commission
that
a
blanket-wide
industry
exemption
must
be
given
with
blanket-wide
surveillance.
we
submit
that
the
lines
joined
by
the
court
and
the
commission
finding
more
appropriate
so
that
there
not
be
a
blanket-wide
exemption.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
no,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they
do
mr.
justice
white,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they
inquired
to
that
as
one
of
the
standards
set
forth.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
moment
mr.
white,
if
i'm
--
justice
white
if
i
may.
i
think
that's
a
very
valid
and
pertinent
question
because
i
think
we
must
look
at
the
standards
to
which
the
commission
would
apply.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they're
within
an
antitrust
exemption,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
now
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
the
statute
--
first,
mr.
justice
white,
does
not
require
a
blanket-wide
exemption
for
the
industry
if
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
it's
non-competitive
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
or
it's
non-antitrust.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
in
their
brief,
they
indicate
that
every
matter
posing
a
sherman
act
situation
should
be
submitted
to
the
commission
for
prior
approval.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
we
think
not.
we
think
that
every
agreement
which
would
presuppose
the
possibility
of
an
exemption
in
the
interest
of
conference
system
to
be
required
to
be
submitted
for
a
possible
exemption
but
there
is
no
intent
of
congress
to
grant
a
broad
exemption.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
that's
correct.
now
we
submit
that
if
it's
not
inimical
to
the
maritime
industry
on
a
situation
such
as
this
were
--
there
is
no
removal
of
the
competition
which
would
otherwise
exist
between
the
parties
by
this
agreement
that
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
would
be
more
appropriate
to
be
concern
with
this.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
that
is
correct.
now,
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
would
urge
that
all
these
standards
of
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes
your
honor.
i
think
the
commission
would
probably
double
or
triple
its
size
and
the
--
now
it's
considerably
larger
but
we
don't
believe
that
that's
the
position
we
should
adhere
to.
the
key
point
is
that
filing
under
section
15
does
presuppose
the
possibility
or
susceptibility
of
the
grant
of
an
exemption.
now,
it's
true
that
after
filing
under
section
15,
there
is
surveillance
of
the
activities
by
the
federal
maritime
commission.
however,
we
would
hope
that
in
the
absence
of
surveillance
by
a
specific
regulatory
agency,
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
is
still
enforcing
the
antitrust
laws
against
violation
of
those
laws.
if
not,
perhaps
the
commission
should
increase
its
surveillance
not
only
over
the
maritime
industry
but
perhaps
other
industries.
the
petitioners
have
not
given
one
sound
logical
reason
why
the
industry
must
receive
a
blanket-wide
antitrust
exemption
nor
how
they
point
it
to
a
single
decision
of
this
court
or
indeed
a
single
phrase
of
the
legislative
history
which
would
indicate
that
there
was
the
intention
for
a
blanket
exemption
for
this
industry.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
basic
rationale,
the
commission's
decision
was
that
if
--
would
look
at
those
agreements
and
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
removal
of
the
competitive
relationship
or
the
competition
which
otherwise
exist
absent
to
that
agreement.
that
was
stated
on
page
676
--
674
of
the
record
in
the
commission's
opinion
according
to
its
earlier
decision
in
the
roach
case.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
it
would
give
an
antitrust
exemption.
as
what
any
agreement
filed
were
and
approved
by
the
commission.
now,
in
those
de
minimis
matters
which
the
other
side
has
mentioned,
parties
may
sometimes
still
want
to
come
to
the
commission
for
approval
so
if
they
will
have
the
antitrust
exemption.
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
they
mentioned
the
recent
repeal
of
the
shipping
act
in
the
last
session
of
congress
to
provide
for
exemption
from
filing
a
certain
category
of
agreements
but
the
parties
could
still
come
into
the
commission,
seek
that
approval
and
if
granted
it,
would
then
receive
the
antitrust
exemption.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
more
appropriate
for
me
to
differ
that
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
to
mr.
torre
who
is
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
in
the
industry.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
now
in
searching
for
justification
for
the
position
that
the
petitioners
have
set
forth
today,
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
have
argued
that
the
parties
maybe
hesitant
to
enter
into
agreements
involving
the
maritime
industry
and
may
desire
to
remove
the
clout
of
antitrust
violation
from
their
activities.
now,
it's
inconceivable
to
us
that
this
court
would
endorse
a
position
that
the
way
to
remove
the
clout
of
antitrust
violation
or
law
violation
from
an
industry
or
from
certain
parties
would
be
to
exempt
them
from
the
laws
that
they
may
well
be
violating.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
just
what
the
commission
would
have
done
in
that
situation.
they
may
well
have
said
this
as
not
the
type
of
agreement,
this
is
--
does
not
remove
the
competitive
impact
therefore
we
will
not
accept
it
for
filing.
they
may
have
said
notwithstanding
that
this
is
not
an
agreement
susceptible
of
the
antitrust
exemption.
we
will
look
at
other
aspects
of
it
and
comment
on
16
and
17
potential
violations.
now
in
the
past,
the
commission
in
wanting
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
no,
they
had
not.
they
might
well
have
done
that.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they
may
well
have
but
it
would
be
a
moot
if
there
is
in
fact
no
antitrust
violation
that
they
just
would've
gotten
when
they
--
would
be
similar
to
a
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
it
would
be
similar
to
them
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
commission
would
--
could
well
say
this
is
not
the
type
of
agreement
that
we
must
look
at
therefore
we
will
--
it's
not
necessary
if
i
will
not
accept
it
for
filing,
not
grant
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
antitrust
exemption.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
because
in
that
event,
there
would
have
been
a
removal
of
the
competitive
situation
which
would
have
existed
otherwise
absent
the
agreement.
the
members
of
the
pma,
the
terminal
operators
would
not
have
had
the
option
of
passing
on
or
not
passing
on
of
prorate
in
the
cost
or
not
bringing
the
cost
to
--
its
entirely
up
to
the
membership
and
vigilant
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
the
commission
found
specifically
that
there
was
no
agreement
to
pass
on,
no
understanding
to
pass
on.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
now
that's
the
position
that
the
solicitor
general
in
its
brief
urged
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
what
the
commission
would
have
done
in
that
situation
because
it
did
not
find
that
here
but
had
it
found
that,
it
may
well
have
said,
yes,
we
--
that
this
does
involve
section
15
situation.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
it
would
remove
the
competition
which
would
exist
between
the
parties.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
alright.
here,
there
were
the
--
the
competition
among
the
members
of
pma,
like
mtc
and
other
terminal
operators,
other
stevedores.
they
did
not
change
the
competition
between
them.
they
were
still
in
a
position
to
compete
equally
for
the
off
loading
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
think
if
it
did
affect
competition
among
shippers,
i
think
that
the
commission
would
be
compelled
to
say,
yes,
this
is
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
in
a
competition
among
carriers,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
and
among
stevedores?
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
they
were
party
to
this
agreement,
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
between
ports?
section
16
clearly
covers
that.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
an
agreement
between
carriers
was
in
derogation
of
the
right
of
ports
to
compete
for
cargo?
yes,
i
think
in
that
situation.
the
commission
would
say
this
was
a
15
type
of
agreement.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
believe
it
would.
the
commission
found
none
of
that
here.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
no.
no,
sir.
but
there
was
an
extensive
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes.
now,
there
was
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
an
extensive
dissent
filed
at
the
commission
so
the
commission
did
--
have
before
these
contentions
but
they
rejected
them
all.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they
didn't
answer
them
specifically
but
in
so
--
the
voting
and
the
way
they
did,
they
obviously
rejected
his
contentions.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
the
commission
determined
that
it
did
not
affect
the
competitive
relationship,
it
would
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
the
commission
determined
that
that
agreement
did
not
affect
the
competitive
relationship
they
would
otherwise
have
existed
absent,
the
agreement.
the
commission
would
say
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
agreement
that
would
be
susceptible
to
issuance
of
an
antitrust
exemption
and
therefore
it
will
not
accept
it
for
filing.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
what
could
happen
if
this
--
the
commission
did
not
have
this
discretion,
parties
in
the
industry
--
companies
in
the
industry
could
form
an
agreement
between
themselves,
two
or
three
carriers
to
engage
in
another
type
of
industry
perhaps
a
lumber
industry
or
manufacturing
or
any
number
of
industries
that
we
alluded
to
this
in
our
brief.
they
could
file
their
agreement
that
covered
ocean
shipping
and
then
seek
an
antitrust
exemption
of
this
other
activities
of
theirs.
this
would
be
incomprehensible
to
us
to
assume
that
the
commission
should
be
compelled
to
approve
that
or
accept
that
for
filing.
now,
on
the
other
hand
by
the
standards
under
which
the
commission
must
determine
whether
or
not
an
agreement
violates
the
shipping
act.
these
incidental
items,
the
antitrust
violations
in
other
areas,
non-maritime
would
not
be
detrimental
to
ocean
foreign
commerce,
it
would
not
be
detrimental
to
shippers,
to
competitors.
it's
reducing
the
cost
of
ocean
transportation
if
the
--
or
permit
to
engage
in
this
antitrust
violation
that's
been
sanctioned
by
the
commission
on
the
maritime
aspects.
so
i
think
that
basically
in
response
to
your
question,
yes,
the
commission
would
say,
this
is
not
the
type
of
agreement
that
we
can
approve.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
your
honor,
the
commission
in
reaching
it's
conclusion
on
this
case
relied
upon
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
given
by
this
court
in
the
carnation
case.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
in
the
carnation
case.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
sir.
now,
the
petitioners
have
expressed
the
fear
that
non-requiring,
a
filing
under
section
15
would
result
in
these
parties
not
being
under
any
government
surveillance
or
regulatory
surveillance.
but
that's
not
so,
they
would
still
be
of
course
would
not
be
placed
beyond
the
tail
of
government
regulation
as
we
have
point
out
that
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
would
instead
be
surveilling
this.
now,
we
mentioned
earlier
or
it
is
mentioned
earlier
that
there
are
three
possible
agreements
here,
one,
the
labor
agreement
or
the
agreement
between
pma
and
the
union.
the
second
agreement,
the
agreement
between
among
the
membership
of
pma
as
to
how
this
cost
would
be
collected.
and
the
third
agreement
which
volkswagen
asserts
us
here
is
agreement
to
pass
on
the
cost.
now,
the
commission
--
the
third
can
be
dispensed
off
really.
the
commission
found
clearly
that
there
was
no
agreement
to
pass
on.
the
solicitor
argues
in
its
brief
that
it
links
reality
to
suggest
(inaudible)
that
this
cost
would
not
affect
shippers.
now,
surely
the
solicitor
general
is
not
urging
as
a
national
economic
policy
or
philosophy
that
every
wage
increase
and
that's
what's
involve
here
must
result
in
a
corresponding
price
increase.
the
solicitor
general
has
acknowledged
that
if
the
agreement
among
pma
membership
is
an
integral
part
of
collective
bargaining,
it
would
have
to
be
exempt
from
filing
under
section
15
and
mr.
torre
will
address
himself
to
this
that
the
commission
clearly
felt
that
this
agreement
was
not
inimical
to
the
purposes
of
the
shipping
act.
now
in
their
brief,
the
solicitor
general
also
urges
that
one
who
would
carve
out
an
exemption
from
the
broad
statutory
language
of
section
15
must
sustain
the
burden.
we
think
not.
we
think
that
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
burden
is
instead
upon
one
who
would
carve
out
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
that
--
that's
what's
involved
here.
the
brief
were
in
--
the
few
moments
remaining
concerning
the
alleged
violations
of
section
16
and
17,
it's
indeed
regrettable
that
this
court
has
to
dwell
at
this
juncture
on
a
simple
burden
of
proof
issue.
it
is
clear
that
the
petitioner,
volkswagen
did
not
prove
before
the
commission
nor
was
there
a
sufficient
evidence
for
the
commission
to
find
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
16
and
17.
concededly,
conduct
may
well
be
discriminatory
and
prejudicial
but
it
is
up
to
the
regulatory
agency
with
the
expertise
knowledge
of
the
workings
of
the
industry,
the
needs
of
the
industry
and
the
activity
of
the
industry
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
conduct
involved
is
--
in
the
words
of
the
statute
undue,
unreasonable
or
unjust.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
would
think
that
if
the
petitioner
is
willing
to
rely
on
the
record
in
16
and
17,
fine,
because
i
do
not
believe
they
maintain
the
record
to
show
violation
of
16
and
17.
but
mr.
justice
white
in
response
to
your
question,
i
think
the
proper
situation
in
that
respect
would
be
a
remand
to
the
commission
for
a
taking
of
evidence
on
the
issue
of
16
and
17
violations.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
believe
on
the
record
before
it
had
found
that
there
was
no
showing
of
a
violation
of
16
and
17.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they
may
well
come
to
the
same
conclusion
again.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
it
may
well
be
a
different
type
of
case
then.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
you
disagree
with
us
on
15,
i
would
believe
that
this
court
would
want
to
remand
for
a
different
record
on
16
and
17.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
not
really.
in
the
decision
cited
by
the
petitioner,
the
commission
was
very
careful
to
narrowly
construe
the
change
from
it,
full
change
from
its
prior
position.
in
those
situations,
what
were
involved
--
in
those
cases
what
were
involved
were
free
storage
time
where
--
we're
talking
about
the
same
commodity.
and
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
space
is
space.
the
commission
said,
in
those
situation
on
the
--
i
believe
it's
a
(inaudible)
on
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
we
changed
our
prior
position.
it
didn't
say
we
change
carte
blanche
or
a
our
prior
position.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
we
could
completely
say
at
the
commission
has
reversed
its
prior
holdings.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
volkswagen
may
well
want
to
be
tried.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
could
certainly
understand
volkswagen.
for
example,
wanting
to
go
back
to
the
commission
and
urging
that
the
commission
has
changed
its
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
of
course,
we
feel
that
there's
enough
in
the
record
to
justify
the
decision
reached
by
the
commission
previously
but
the
commission
is
not
reluctant
to
your
case
which
should
properly
be
before
it.
now,
volkswagen
has
never
submitted
to
the
commission,
a
showing
of
what
its
cost
were
with
respect
to
the
various
stevedores
or
what
the
cost
history
had
actually
been
before
or
after
mtc
included
as
a
part
of
its
cost,
increased
labor
cost
which
it
sustained
in
connection
with
the
net
fund.
in
their
reply
brief,
they
mentioned
that
they
were
estopped
from
submitting
this
evidence
but
i
think
the
record
would
indicate
this
information
concerning
what
their
cost
were
should've
been
in
their
possession,
could've
been
submitted
on
by
themselves
in
the
hearing.
there
is
evidence
that
mtc's
total
labor
cost
declined
as
a
result
of
implementation
of
this
foresighted
and
farsighted
agreement
that
was
negotiated
by
mr.
st.
sure
in
the
interest
of
inline
management
labor
relations.
and
in
conclusion,
to
answer
the
question
which
the
petitioners
have
presented
to
this
court
as
to
why
the
commission
interpreted
section
15
so
narrowly,
the
answer
your
honors
is
very
simple
because
this
court
has
said
it
should.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
excuse
me,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
this
juncture,
it
appears
abundantly
clear
that
there
is
some
confusion
as
to
the
impact
concerning
filing
or
non-filing
under
section
15
of
the
shipping
act.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
mr.
herzfeld
urges
that
the
commission
needs
some
guidelines
from
this
court
and
urges
that
the
commission
denied
them
their
day
in
court.
yet
he
is
urging
that
the
commission
be
given
even
broader
and
more
extensive
powers
than
the
commission
itself
has
ever
sought.
i
will
primarily
address
myself
to
consideration
of
the
question
of
the
impact
of
filing
or
non-filing
under
section
15.
mr.
torre
representing
pma
will
primarily
address
himself
to
clarify
in
the
confusion
which
the
petitioner
has
sought
to
create
by
obfuscation
of
the
facts
and
the
record
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
would
open
a
veritable
pandora's
box
if
the
interpretation
given
to
this
shipping
act
or
to
be
accepted
by
this
court
and
if
this
court
were
--
as
result
of
the
hearing
today
to
completely
reverse
the
wisdom
of
its
decision
in
the
case
of
carnation
company
versus
pacific
westbound
conference
cited
in
our
brief.
not
only
would
a
pandora's
box
be
opened
but
acceptance
of
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
shipping
act
would
completely
derogate
an
important
segment
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
we
know
why
volkswagen
is
in
this
court
today.
they
said
that
they're
in
the
court
challenging
the
position
of
the
commission
as
to
section
15.
they're
really
on
this
court
as
a
result
of
an
attempt
to
lower
their
price
by
persuading
their
supplier
to
remove
from
their
cost
base
a
segment
of
their
cost.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
why
is
the
united
state
here?
the
maritime
commission
here
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
he
is
speaking
for
the
united
states,
yes
sir.
the
maritime
commission
is
here
to
defend
the
decision
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
sir.
and
that
gets
the
point
that
i
was
going
to
bring
up
next.
we
can't
understand
why
the
department
of
justice
is
attempting
to
channel
to
an
independent
regulatory
agency
enforcement
of
antitrust
laws
in
the
area
of
the
maritime
industry
where
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
would
not
be
inimical
to
the
purposes
of
the
shipping
act.
now,
the
question
was
raised
earlier
by
i
believe
mr.
posner,
a
comment
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
shipping
act
1916.
the
purpose
of
that
act
was
not
necessarily
or
solely
to
bring
under
scrutiny
of
the
commission
the
activities
of
this
industry.
no,
it
was
instead
to
provide
a
system
for
granting
an
exemption
to
that
industry
coupled
with
surveillance.
now,
it's
not
the
position
of
this
court.
it
has
--
not
in
the
position
of
this
court
nor
the
commission
that
a
blanket-wide
industry
exemption
must
be
given
with
blanket-wide
surveillance.
we
submit
that
the
lines
joined
by
the
court
and
the
commission
finding
more
appropriate
so
that
there
not
be
a
blanket-wide
exemption.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
no,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they
do
mr.
justice
white,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they
inquired
to
that
as
one
of
the
standards
set
forth.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
moment
mr.
white,
if
i'm
--
justice
white
if
i
may.
i
think
that's
a
very
valid
and
pertinent
question
because
i
think
we
must
look
at
the
standards
to
which
the
commission
would
apply.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they're
within
an
antitrust
exemption,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
now
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
the
statute
--
first,
mr.
justice
white,
does
not
require
a
blanket-wide
exemption
for
the
industry
if
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
it's
non-competitive
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
or
it's
non-antitrust.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
in
their
brief,
they
indicate
that
every
matter
posing
a
sherman
act
situation
should
be
submitted
to
the
commission
for
prior
approval.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
we
think
not.
we
think
that
every
agreement
which
would
presuppose
the
possibility
of
an
exemption
in
the
interest
of
conference
system
to
be
required
to
be
submitted
for
a
possible
exemption
but
there
is
no
intent
of
congress
to
grant
a
broad
exemption.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
that's
correct.
now
we
submit
that
if
it's
not
inimical
to
the
maritime
industry
on
a
situation
such
as
this
were
--
there
is
no
removal
of
the
competition
which
would
otherwise
exist
between
the
parties
by
this
agreement
that
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
would
be
more
appropriate
to
be
concern
with
this.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
that
is
correct.
now,
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
would
urge
that
all
these
standards
of
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes
your
honor.
i
think
the
commission
would
probably
double
or
triple
its
size
and
the
--
now
it's
considerably
larger
but
we
don't
believe
that
that's
the
position
we
should
adhere
to.
the
key
point
is
that
filing
under
section
15
does
presuppose
the
possibility
or
susceptibility
of
the
grant
of
an
exemption.
now,
it's
true
that
after
filing
under
section
15,
there
is
surveillance
of
the
activities
by
the
federal
maritime
commission.
however,
we
would
hope
that
in
the
absence
of
surveillance
by
a
specific
regulatory
agency,
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
is
still
enforcing
the
antitrust
laws
against
violation
of
those
laws.
if
not,
perhaps
the
commission
should
increase
its
surveillance
not
only
over
the
maritime
industry
but
perhaps
other
industries.
the
petitioners
have
not
given
one
sound
logical
reason
why
the
industry
must
receive
a
blanket-wide
antitrust
exemption
nor
how
they
point
it
to
a
single
decision
of
this
court
or
indeed
a
single
phrase
of
the
legislative
history
which
would
indicate
that
there
was
the
intention
for
a
blanket
exemption
for
this
industry.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
basic
rationale,
the
commission's
decision
was
that
if
--
would
look
at
those
agreements
and
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
removal
of
the
competitive
relationship
or
the
competition
which
otherwise
exist
absent
to
that
agreement.
that
was
stated
on
page
676
--
674
of
the
record
in
the
commission's
opinion
according
to
its
earlier
decision
in
the
roach
case.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
it
would
give
an
antitrust
exemption.
as
what
any
agreement
filed
were
and
approved
by
the
commission.
now,
in
those
de
minimis
matters
which
the
other
side
has
mentioned,
parties
may
sometimes
still
want
to
come
to
the
commission
for
approval
so
if
they
will
have
the
antitrust
exemption.
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
they
mentioned
the
recent
repeal
of
the
shipping
act
in
the
last
session
of
congress
to
provide
for
exemption
from
filing
a
certain
category
of
agreements
but
the
parties
could
still
come
into
the
commission,
seek
that
approval
and
if
granted
it,
would
then
receive
the
antitrust
exemption.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
more
appropriate
for
me
to
differ
that
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
to
mr.
torre
who
is
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
in
the
industry.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
now
in
searching
for
justification
for
the
position
that
the
petitioners
have
set
forth
today,
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
have
argued
that
the
parties
maybe
hesitant
to
enter
into
agreements
involving
the
maritime
industry
and
may
desire
to
remove
the
clout
of
antitrust
violation
from
their
activities.
now,
it's
inconceivable
to
us
that
this
court
would
endorse
a
position
that
the
way
to
remove
the
clout
of
antitrust
violation
or
law
violation
from
an
industry
or
from
certain
parties
would
be
to
exempt
them
from
the
laws
that
they
may
well
be
violating.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
just
what
the
commission
would
have
done
in
that
situation.
they
may
well
have
said
this
as
not
the
type
of
agreement,
this
is
--
does
not
remove
the
competitive
impact
therefore
we
will
not
accept
it
for
filing.
they
may
have
said
notwithstanding
that
this
is
not
an
agreement
susceptible
of
the
antitrust
exemption.
we
will
look
at
other
aspects
of
it
and
comment
on
16
and
17
potential
violations.
now
in
the
past,
the
commission
in
wanting
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
no,
they
had
not.
they
might
well
have
done
that.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they
may
well
have
but
it
would
be
a
moot
if
there
is
in
fact
no
antitrust
violation
that
they
just
would've
gotten
when
they
--
would
be
similar
to
a
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
it
would
be
similar
to
them
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
commission
would
--
could
well
say
this
is
not
the
type
of
agreement
that
we
must
look
at
therefore
we
will
--
it's
not
necessary
if
i
will
not
accept
it
for
filing,
not
grant
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
antitrust
exemption.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
because
in
that
event,
there
would
have
been
a
removal
of
the
competitive
situation
which
would
have
existed
otherwise
absent
the
agreement.
the
members
of
the
pma,
the
terminal
operators
would
not
have
had
the
option
of
passing
on
or
not
passing
on
of
prorate
in
the
cost
or
not
bringing
the
cost
to
--
its
entirely
up
to
the
membership
and
vigilant
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
the
commission
found
specifically
that
there
was
no
agreement
to
pass
on,
no
understanding
to
pass
on.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
now
that's
the
position
that
the
solicitor
general
in
its
brief
urged
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
what
the
commission
would
have
done
in
that
situation
because
it
did
not
find
that
here
but
had
it
found
that,
it
may
well
have
said,
yes,
we
--
that
this
does
involve
section
15
situation.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
it
would
remove
the
competition
which
would
exist
between
the
parties.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
alright.
here,
there
were
the
--
the
competition
among
the
members
of
pma,
like
mtc
and
other
terminal
operators,
other
stevedores.
they
did
not
change
the
competition
between
them.
they
were
still
in
a
position
to
compete
equally
for
the
off
loading
in
(voice

--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
think
if
it
did
affect
competition
among
shippers,
i
think
that
the
commission
would
be
compelled
to
say,
yes,
this
is
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
in
a
competition
among
carriers,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
and
among
stevedores?
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
they
were
party
to
this
agreement,
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
between
ports?
section
16
clearly
covers
that.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
an
agreement
between
carriers
was
in
derogation
of
the
right
of
ports
to
compete
for
cargo?
yes,
i
think
in
that
situation.
the
commission
would
say
this
was
a
15
type
of
agreement.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
believe
it
would.
the
commission
found
none
of
that
here.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
no.
no,
sir.
but
there
was
an
extensive
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes.
now,
there
was
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
--
an
extensive
dissent
filed
at
the
commission
so
the
commission
did
--
have
before
these
contentions
but
they
rejected
them
all.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they
didn't
answer
them
specifically
but
in
so
--
the
voting
and
the
way
they
did,
they
obviously
rejected
his
contentions.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
the
commission
determined
that
it
did
not
affect
the
competitive
relationship,
it
would
--
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
the
commission
determined
that
that
agreement
did
not
affect
the
competitive
relationship
they
would
otherwise
have
existed
absent,
the
agreement.
the
commission
would
say
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
agreement
that
would
be
susceptible
to
issuance
of
an
antitrust
exemption
and
therefore
it
will
not
accept
it
for
filing.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
what
could
happen
if
this
--
the
commission
did
not
have
this
discretion,
parties
in
the
industry
--
companies
in
the
industry
could
form
an
agreement
between
themselves,
two
or
three
carriers
to
engage
in
another
type
of
industry
perhaps
a
lumber
industry
or
manufacturing
or
any
number
of
industries
that
we
alluded
to
this
in
our
brief.
they
could
file
their
agreement
that
covered
ocean
shipping
and
then
seek
an
antitrust
exemption
of
this
other
activities
of
theirs.
this
would
be
incomprehensible
to
us
to
assume
that
the
commission
should
be
compelled
to
approve
that
or
accept
that
for
filing.
now,
on
the
other
hand
by
the
standards
under
which
the
commission
must
determine
whether
or
not
an
agreement
violates
the
shipping
act.
these
incidental
items,
the
antitrust
violations
in
other
areas,
non-maritime
would
not
be
detrimental
to
ocean
foreign
commerce,
it
would
not
be
detrimental
to
shippers,
to
competitors.
it's
reducing
the
cost
of
ocean
transportation
if
the
--
or
permit
to
engage
in
this
antitrust
violation
that's
been
sanctioned
by
the
commission
on
the
maritime
aspects.
so
i
think
that
basically
in
response
to
your
question,
yes,
the
commission
would
say,
this
is
not
the
type
of
agreement
that
we
can
approve.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
your
honor,
the
commission
in
reaching
it's
conclusion
on
this
case
relied
upon
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
given
by
this
court
in
the
carnation
case.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
in
the
carnation
case.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
yes,
sir.
now,
the
petitioners
have
expressed
the
fear
that
non-requiring,
a
filing
under
section
15
would
result
in
these
parties
not
being
under
any
government
surveillance
or
regulatory
surveillance.
but
that's
not
so,
they
would
still
be
of
course
would
not
be
placed
beyond
the
tail
of
government
regulation
as
we
have
point
out
that
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
would
instead
be
surveilling
this.
now,
we
mentioned
earlier
or
it
is
mentioned
earlier
that
there
are
three
possible
agreements
here,
one,
the
labor
agreement
or
the
agreement
between
pma
and
the
union.
the
second
agreement,
the
agreement
between
among
the
membership
of
pma
as
to
how
this
cost
would
be
collected.
and
the
third
agreement
which
volkswagen
asserts
us
here
is
agreement
to
pass
on
the
cost.
now,
the
commission
--
the
third
can
be
dispensed
off
really.
the
commission
found
clearly
that
there
was
no
agreement
to
pass
on.
the
solicitor
argues
in
its
brief
that
it
links
reality
to
suggest
(inaudible)
that
this
cost
would
not
affect
shippers.
now,
surely
the
solicitor
general
is
not
urging
as
a
national
economic
policy
or
philosophy
that
every
wage
increase
and
that's
what's
involve
here
must
result
in
a
corresponding
price
increase.
the
solicitor
general
has
acknowledged
that
if
the
agreement
among
pma
membership
is
an
integral
part
of
collective
bargaining,
it
would
have
to
be
exempt
from
filing
under
section
15
and
mr.
torre
will
address
himself
to
this
that
the
commission
clearly
felt
that
this
agreement
was
not
inimical
to
the
purposes
of
the
shipping
act.
now
in
their
brief,
the
solicitor
general
also
urges
that
one
who
would
carve
out
an
exemption
from
the
broad
statutory
language
of
section
15
must
sustain
the
burden.
we
think
not.
we
think
that
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
burden
is
instead
upon
one
who
would
carve
out
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
that
--
that's
what's
involved
here.
the
brief
were
in
--
the
few
moments
remaining
concerning
the
alleged
violations
of
section
16
and
17,
it's
indeed
regrettable
that
this
court
has
to
dwell
at
this
juncture
on
a
simple
burden
of
proof
issue.
it
is
clear
that
the
petitioner,
volkswagen
did
not
prove
before
the
commission
nor
was
there
a
sufficient
evidence
for
the
commission
to
find
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
16
and
17.
concededly,
conduct
may
well
be
discriminatory
and
prejudicial
but
it
is
up
to
the
regulatory
agency
with
the
expertise
knowledge
of
the
workings
of
the
industry,
the
needs
of
the
industry
and
the
activity
of
the
industry
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
conduct
involved
is
--
in
the
words
of
the
statute
undue,
unreasonable
or
unjust.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
would
think
that
if
the
petitioner
is
willing
to
rely
on
the
record
in
16
and
17,
fine,
because
i
do
not
believe
they
maintain
the
record
to
show
violation
of
16
and
17.
but
mr.
justice
white
in
response
to
your
question,
i
think
the
proper
situation
in
that
respect
would
be
a
remand
to
the
commission
for
a
taking
of
evidence
on
the
issue
of
16
and
17
violations.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
believe
on
the
record
before
it
had
found
that
there
was
no
showing
of
a
violation
of
16
and
17.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
they
may
well
come
to
the
same
conclusion
again.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
it
may
well
be
a
different
type
of
case
then.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
you
disagree
with
us
on
15,
i
would
believe
that
this
court
would
want
to
remand
for
a
different
record
on
16
and
17.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
not
really.
in
the
decision
cited
by
the
petitioner,
the
commission
was
very
careful
to
narrowly
construe
the
change
from
it,
full
change
from
its
prior
position.
in
those
situations,
what
were
involved
--
in
those
cases
what
were
involved
were
free
storage
time
where
--
we're
talking
about
the
same
commodity.
and
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
space
is
space.
the
commission
said,
in
those
situation
on
the
--
i
believe
it's
a
(inaudible)
on
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
we
changed
our
prior
position.
it
didn't
say
we
change
carte
blanche
or
a
our
prior
position.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
we
could
completely
say
at
the
commission
has
reversed
its
prior
holdings.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
if
volkswagen
may
well
want
to
be
tried.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
i
could
certainly
understand
volkswagen.
for
example,
wanting
to
go
back
to
the
commission
and
urging
that
the
commission
has
changed
its
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
katz
well,
of
course,
we
feel
that
there's
enough
in
the
record
to
justify
the
decision
reached
by
the
commission
previously
but
the
commission
is
not
reluctant
to
your
case
which
should
properly
be
before
it.
now,
volkswagen
has
never
submitted
to
the
commission,
a
showing
of
what
its
cost
were
with
respect
to
the
various
stevedores
or
what
the
cost
history
had
actually
been
before
or
after
mtc
included
as
a
part
of
its
cost,
increased
labor
cost
which
it
sustained
in
connection
with
the
net
fund.
in
their
reply
brief,
they
mentioned
that
they
were
estopped
from
submitting
this
evidence
but
i
think
the
record
would
indicate
this
information
concerning
what
their
cost
were
should've
been
in
their
possession,
could've
been
submitted
on
by
themselves
in
the
hearing.
there
is
evidence
that
mtc's
total
labor
cost
declined
as
a
result
of
implementation
of
this
foresighted
and
farsighted
agreement
that
was
negotiated
by
mr.
st.
sure
in
the
interest
of
inline
management
labor
relations.
and
in
conclusion,
to
answer
the
question
which
the
petitioners
have
presented
to
this
court
as
to
why
the
commission
interpreted
section
15
so
narrowly,
the
answer
your
honors
is
very
simple
because
this
court
has
said
it
should.
