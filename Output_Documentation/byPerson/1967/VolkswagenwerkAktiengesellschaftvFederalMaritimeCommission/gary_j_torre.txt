mr.
gary
j.
torre
i'm
speaking
for
the
pacific
maritime
association,
the
intervenor
in
this
case
and
i
hope
i
can
clear
up
some
of
the
confusions
that
obviously
had
been
created.
i'd
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
i
think
it's
the
easiest
one,
the
answer
as
to
whether
there
is
an
ongoing
obligation
with
respect
to
the
mechanization
fund,
my
answer
is,
yes,
there
is.
the
contract
was
renegotiated
during
the
bargaining
session
that
was
concluded
last
summer
with
the
ilwu
renewed
for
an
additional
five
years.
there's
an
additional
$33
million
being
paid
in
employee
benefits,
substantially
retirement,
health
--
not
health,
disability
and
death
benefits.
the
period
of
time
over
which
it
--
while
the
contract
is
for
five
years,
the
benefits
will
be
paid
over
a
total
of
eight
years
from
last
july.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it's
at
a
slightly
higher
rate
than
$5
million
a
year
but
i'd
like
to
explain
that
the
$5
million
a
year
is
the
maximum
rate
and
it
will
never
be
and
has
--
in
the
first
three
years,
it
was
collected
at
that
rate
but
it
cannot
be
collected
at
that
rate
and
paid
out
at
that
rate,
it
will
be
--
always
the
lower
rate.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
one
of
the
benefits
that
is
known
as
the
vesting
benefit
is
essentially
--
it's
been
determined
by
the
internal
revenue
service
at
any
rate
to
be
an
early
retirement
benefit.
and
the
manner
in
which
the
plan
was
set
up,
it
was
impossible
to
fund
that
benefit
with
prior
funding
as
the
industry
wish
to
do.
they
wish
to
set
up
this
early
retirement
benefit
and
fund
it
within
the
five-year
period.
this
could
not
be
done
and
established
the
right
to
deduct
the
sums
of
money
that
were
being
put
into
the
vesting
benefit
trust.
we
have
been
compelled
in
order
to
get
the
tax
result
upon
which
the
plan
was
dependent
to
establish
what
is
known
as
a
current
payment
pension
plan.
we
only
therefore
--
therefore,
we
only
collect
the
amount
of
money
that
is
necessary
to
pay
current
vesting
benefits.
we
have
several
thousand
men
who
have
retired
and
more
are
continually
retiring
where
they
are
looking
forward
to
getting
those
who
retired
under
the
initial
plan,
$220
a
month
and
until
they've
received
approximately
$8000,
they
have
claims
against
the
trust
and
we
collect
currently
to
pay
this
benefit.
now
this
means,
since
some
men
will
retire
in
the
last
months
of
the
plan,
it
means,
we
have
to
have
provisions
where
we
will
be
collecting
three
years
later
because
it's
paid
out
over
a
three-year
term.
and
our
maximum
annual
amount
is
reduced
in
order
to
make
the
provision
for
this
later
collection.
so,
the
rates
in
the
first
three
years
were
$5
million
but
they've
gone
down
which
of
course
means
that
the
rate
on
the
tonnage
assessment
goes
down
for
everybody
who
is
subject
to
it.
also,
as
the
cargo
increases
in
volume,
the
rate
goes
down.
so
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
it
imposes
extraordinary
burdens
on
volkswagen.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
if
it
did
cause
volkswagen
to
be
burdened
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
well,
volkswagen
has
alleged
that.
they
had
a
trial
on
that
and
they
didn't
prove
that
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
but
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
trial
examiner
who
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
--
listened
to
the
evidence.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
not
because
it
is
supported
by
uncontroverted
evidence.
what
the
record
in
this
case
shows
is
that
the
cause
of
discharging
volkswagen
did
not
go
up.
the
solicitor
in
his
brief
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
there
is
but
that
difference
exist
for
everyone.
if
i
may
explain
where
that
comes
from
your
honor,
the
revenue
tons
that
a
vessel
collects
will
always
generally,
and
this
is
common
carriers,
will
always
be
computed
on
the
basis
of
weight
or
measurement
whichever
is
greater.
the
reason
they
select
whichever
is
greater
is
because
the
carrying
capacity
of
a
ship
is
limited
by
two
factors,
the
size
of
the
hold
and
the
displacement
of
the
vessel.
some
cargos,
they
do
not
take
up
as
much
space
will
be
heavier.
cargos
that
take
up
as
both
--
as
automobiles
generally,
it
isn't
just
volkswagen.
a
large
cube
will
be
lighter
in
terms
of
the
proportion
of
space
and
weight.
now,
if
a
vessel
did
not
take
the
larger
of
the
two
measures
the
result
would
be
--
while
a
cargo
that
took
up
a
lot
of
space
so
they
couldn't
carry
the
full
displacement
if
they
computed
it
on
the
revenue
tons
on
the
basis
of
weight,
the
vessel
would
have
not
been
able
to
be
compensated
for
its
carrying
capacity.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it's
10
to
1
on
an
automobile
--
on
an
automobile
generally
quicksilver,
the
weight
to
something
like
14
to
1
which
--
what
i
mean
is
that
the
weight
measurement
for
quicksilver
is
14
times
the
space
it
will
take
up
just
because
quicksilver
is
heavier.
now,
we
have
for
generation
collected
the
portion
of
our
membership
dues
that
this
association
is
charging.
incidentally,
this
is
not
a
de
minimis
item.
the
pacific
maritime
association
is
a
very
large
organization
that
deals
with
something
like
eight
unions
that
covers
the
entire
pacific
coast.
it
maintains
hiring
halls
and
very
costly
facilities
and
while
the
figure
isn't
in
the
record,
the
cost
of
running
this
association
is
quite
comparable
to
the
annual
cost
of
the
mechanization
fund.
at
any
rate,
there
is
no
basis
for
this
court
to
presume
it's
a
de
minimis
item
as
i
sat
here
hearing
this
morning.
i
can
assure
you
my
--
our
members
don't
think
so
and
there
is
some
evidence
in
this
record
that
volkswagen
doesn't
think
its
de
minimis.
their
stevedore
contractor
testified
that
the
representative
from
germany
complained
about
the
amount
of
membership
dues
that
marine
terminals
was
incurring
as
a
member
of
the
pacific
maritime
association.
they
were
incurring
it
on
a
measure
--
their
membership
dues
on
a
membership
--
on
a
measurement
basis
and
the
german
representative
wanted
it
to
be
computed
on
the
weight
basis
which
would
have
been
one
tenth,
he
would've
divided
the
due
factor
from
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
all
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
not
as
a
separate
item.
all
clause
that
our
members
incurred
whether
they
are
basic
wages,
overtime
wages,
pensions,
mechanization
cost,
membership
dues,
we
assume
our
members
take
into
account
in
their
total
cost
mix
in
figuring
what
the
rates
of
their
services
are
going
to
be.
if
they
don't,
they'll
go
broke.
there
--
this
seems
self-evident.
it
does
not
follow
that
every
member
will
take
those
clauses
into
account
in
the
same
fashion.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it
is
the
--
pardon.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
can't
say
in
the
substantial
point
as
the
volkswagen
do
because
they
account
from
66%
i
think
of
all
foreign
automobiles
imported
into
the
united
states
but
we
do
have
fiats,
renaults,
mercedes-benz,
and
rolls
royce.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
--
i
think
volkswagen
is
the
only
one
that
comes
in
by
charter,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
fiat
--
fiat
does
not
hire
stevedores.
the
ship
carrying
the
fiat
in,
hires
stevedores
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no
other
manufacturer
of
automobiles
imports
them
into
such
quantities
that
they
have
chartered
ships
that
require
them
to
hire
stevedores.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes
sir.
as
what
i
understand
that
is
so.
and
i'd
like
to
comment
on
that
at
this
moment.
you've
heard
about
how
pma
is
dominated
by
liners.
i
want
to
remind
this
court
that
the
liners
who
are
members
of
pma
that
are
important
are
matson
who
service
hawaii,
the
japanese
flag
ships,
it
service
the
pacific,
apl
which
services
the
pacific
states
line,
pfel.
the
amount
of
service
to
northern
europe
to
the
pacific,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
showing
how
much
it
is
but
it
should
be
rather
common
knowledge
that
the
liners
on
the
pacific
coast
are
servicing
the
pacific
coast
trades
and
not
the
northern
european
trade.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
probably
sir,
not
necessarily.
there
are
stevedores
on
the
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
have
the
slightest
idea.
it
depends
upon
what
is
efficiency
of
taking
a
vessel
off
--
a
car
off
of
a
vessel
will
be.
i
can
tell
you
what
his
labor
cost
are
but
i
don't
know
how
efficiently
he
uses
his
labor.
i
--
the
association
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
he
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
he
makes
the
contribution.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
--
any
employer
or
dock
workers
which
is
--
would
be
a
stevedore
contractor
or
marine
terminal.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
alright.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
if
an
association
stevedore
unloads
the
datsun,
he
will
have
a
charge
measured
by
the
volume
of
the
datsun
that
he
will
have
to
contribute
to
the
mechanization
fund.
what
the
carrier
--
who
hires
him
pays
--
i
haven't
the
slightest
idea.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
exactly.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
exactly,
yes.
in
fact,
all
general
cargo
will
be
on
the
same
cent
rate
and
it
will
be
determined
under
the
same
rule
by
which
we
collect
our
pma
dues.
now
this,
you've
heard
three
things
mentioned.
one,
the
differential
of
both
carriers
--
both
cargos,
well,
pma
tonnage
dues
have
had
that
differential
for
over
40
years.
you've
heard
scrap
metal
mentioned.
scrap
metal
is
a
bulk
cargo
the
way
in
which
it
is
loaded
today,
the
way
in
which
scrap
metal
is
handled
with
magnets
has
been
determined
to
be
a
bulk
cargo.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it
came
up
--
yes,
it
came
up
in
1959
--
1961
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
now
you've
heard
about
coastwise
lumber
which
does
have
a
special
rate.
coastwise
lumber
is
a
general
cargo
and
i'd
like
to
explain
that
because
it
is
extremely
important
that
it
be
understood
that
this
court
could
make
a
serious
error
on
--
if
it
is
not
understood.
most
of
the
carriers
and
handlers,
the
coastwise
lumber
are
all
companies
that
are
not
members
of
the
pacific
maritime
association.
they
conduct
their
own
private
negotiations
with
the
ilwu
as
do
some
other
organizations
but
it's
very
important
on
the
coastwise
lumber
to
recognize
that
they're
all,
except
one
and
it's
not
the
important
one
are
outside
of
the
association.
the
plan,
not
--
like
all
the
rest
of
the
plans
we
have
is
set
up
to
allow
those
members
of
the
industry
who
are
not
a
member
of
our
association
if
they
want
to
participate
through
their
negotiations
with
the
ilwu
who
will
be
able
to
participate
the
pension
plan,
the
welfare
plans,
the
vacation
plans,
the
mech
plan.
if
they
couldn't,
we
would
be
running
the
risk
of
running
them
out
of
business
by
cutting
them
out
of
a
facility
that
employees
would
want
the
benefits
of
it,
it
wouldn't
work
for
them.
ilwu
negotiated
a
lower
rate
than
our
rate
with
the
coastwise
lumber
people.
and
we
were
confronted
with
saying
to
nonmembers,
pay
our
rate
or
don't
participate
in
the
plan
or
reducing
the
rate.
we
reduced
the
rate.
in
other
words,
we
did
just
the
opposite
of
what
this
court
condemned
in
the
pennington
and
jewel
tea
cases.
i
think
we
had
an
obligation
to
reduce
the
rate
but
i
certainly
don't
want
to
be
condemned
for
keeping
the
plan
open
to
nonmembers
to
participate
on
rates
to
get
longshore
employees
that
they
negotiated
with
the
ilwu.
i
see
that
my
time
is
closing,
i'm
--
one
point
i
wish
to
make,
justice
fortas
asked
this
very
early
in
the
argument.
this
case
presents
as
we
have
said
in
our
briefs
and
there
is
just
no
question
of
it
in
our
mind
whether
there's
any
residual
jurisdiction
in
the
maritime
commission
to
supervise
labor
management
relations.
the
findings
of
six
--
page
637
of
this
record,
make
absolutely
clear
that
he
only
thing
pma
members
were
doing
were
implementing
a
collective
commitment
that
it
guaranteed
benefits
to
employees
and
they
were
collecting
the
money
to
pay
those
benefits.
now,
i
think
it's
a
very
usual
thing
in
america,
in
industry
wide
bargaining
today
to
set
up
industry
plans
where
you
guarantee
benefits
to
the
union
in
your
negotiation
and
you
fund
them
as
--
seems
a
reasonable
fashion
among
the
employer
group.
if
we
can't
do
that,
we're
being
treated
differently
than
the
rest
of
the
industry
in
america
and
we've
got
to
know
why
because
we
have
to
accommodate
our
entire
collective
bargaining
process
to
those
standards.
we
can't
work
this
out
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
we
--
our
bargaining
relationships
are
pretty
volatile
and
dynamic
and
we
have
to
know
when
we
go
into
our
negotiations
with
the
maritime
unions,
the
areas
where
we
can
say
yes
or
no
or
we
have
to
say
maybe
depending
upon
what
the
maritime
commission
is
going
to
say.
if
we
don't
know
that,
we're
going
to
be
charged
with
bargaining
in
bad
faith
by
these
unions
and
will
be
hold
up
before
the
nlrb
ultimately
to
have
to
defend
ourselves.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
maritime
shipping
act
that
was
intended
to
treat
the
maritime
industry
differently
than
industry
in
general
in
this
area.
so
what
i'm
really
asserting
is,
if
our
implementing,
a
fringe
benefit
program
where
we
guarantee
benefits
in
anyway
violates
an
antitrust
policy.
it
does
under
the
sherman
act
in
other
industries
too.
and
i
hope
this
court
will
appreciate
what
it
is
deciding
here.
it's
not
just
one
of
little
small
questions
affecting
one
of
the
smaller
industries.
you're
deciding
a
question
under
the
antitrust
laws
that
affect
industry
in
general
i
believe.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
never
in
the
past
your
honor
that
i
know
of,
never.
i
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
maritime
labor
board
that
existed
for
several
years
in
the
late
30s
and
ended
with
the
war
when
war
shipping
took
over
that
i've
referred
the
court
to
in
our
brief
had
a
conciliatory
jurisdiction.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it's
not.
it
has
--
its
no
longer
existent
your
honor.
but
even
then,
that
board
was
supposed
to
be
implementing
the
policies
of
the
nlra.
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
given
any
special
policies
to
implement
it.
it
was
just
--
this
was
a
time
when
you're
having
to
sit
down,
strike
some
boarded
ships
and
it
was
deprived
in
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
that's
correct
and
i
want
to
be
very
clear.
i
don't
think
we
could
immunize
a
price
fixing
scheme
by
putting
it
into
a
collective
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
--
agreement.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
i
won't
go
that
far.
i
have
to
say
in
the
labor
field,
yes,
but
speaking
generally.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
excuse
me
sir,
but
i
think
outsiders
will
suffer
an
impact
even
though
you're
fixing
the
price
of
an
insider.
i
think
that
if
you
have
a
scheme
fixing
the
price
of
terminal
operators
charging
carriers,
this
is
ultimately
going
to
affect
shippers
and
i
think
that's
all
the
commission's
talking
about
when
it's
starting
an
impact
on
outsiders.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
it's
inevitably
always
determines
that.
i
think
the
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
price
fixing
does.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
oh!
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
i
don't
think
that
agreements
that
create
cost
items
create
price
fixing
agreements.
i
quite
agree,
no,
i
don't,
no.
but
i
don't
think
they
should
have
to
be
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
--
filed
or
approved
either
but
certainly,
in
the
labor
field,
not
at
all.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
oh,
i
think
it
would
be
a
disaster.
the
--
i
hesitate
to
position
my
client
be
it
--
here
are
some
of
the
things
that
could
happen
to
us.
there
is
a
policy
of
law
that
says
that
tax
deductions
will
be
denied
if
they
violate
fundamental
public
policies.
we've
been
in
violation
if
this
is
something
that
has
to
go
back
to
the
commission.
it
will
be
going
back
to
the
commission
in
an
area
where
antitrust
is
involved
and
i
would
think
that's
a
fundamental
public
policy
and
i
think
the
commissioner
might
be
encouraged
to
want
to
start
denying
what
is
--
probably
about
$26
million
of
tax
deductions
that
have
been
taken
by
not
the
carriers,
by
their
stevedore
contractors
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
commissioner
could
prevail
on
that
suit
but
if
he
did,
it
would
mean
bankruptcy
for
many
of
them.
now,
you've
been
told
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
solicitor
that
surely
the
members
of
pma
who
have
acquiesced
in
this,
the
courts
would
let
them
lie
where
they
are
but
the
army
has
in
the
last
five
or
six
years,
i
think
moved
approximately
25%
to
30%
of
the
tonnage
that's
crossed
the
docks.
their
accounting
for
this
and
they
have
hired
stevedores
who've
incurred
cost
to
the
mechanization
fund
that
have
not
yet
been
approved
and
i
suppose
the
controller
general
could
say
to
the
army,
if
your
stevedore
charge
had
any
cost
in
there
that
the
maritime
commission
had
to
approve
and
it
wasn't
approved,
you
better
(voice
overlap)
back
again.
now,
of
course
that
money
is
all
been
collected
and
has
been
used
to
pay
benefits
to
longshoremen
and
marine
clerks.
these
are
some
of
the
questions
that
we
would
be
confronted
with.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
your
honor,
we've
always
had
been
faced
with
treble-damage
suits
and
we
avoid
them
by
staying
within
the
law
in
the
sherman
act.
whenever
an
association
of
employers
sit
down
and
make
agreements
on
a
matter
that
is
important
as
the
cost
of
maritime
labor
is
to
ultimate
charges,
somebody
can
come
along
and
challenge
it.
and
we
try
to
very
carefully
stay
within
the
law.
and
when
you
have
120
members
who
are
being
advised
by
most
of
the
law
firms
in
the
pacific
coast,
you
have
to
prove
that
you're
within
the
law
because
the
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
we
--
your
honor
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
your
honor,
what
we
did
here,
we've
been
doing
for
about
40
years
and
no
one
has
suggested
that
we
were
covered
by
the
shipping
act.
now,
this
cart
is
being
asked
to
take
a
law
that's
been
on
the
books
and
construe
it
in
the
fashion
that
nobody
in
this
industry
on
any
coast
has
ever
thought
applied.
now
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
we
--
this
agreement
is
no
different
than
our
dues
collection.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
this
agreement
is
no
--
is
not
a
bit
different
than
the
collection
of
dues
to
pay
for
our
expenses
except
the
money
we
collected
here,
we
used
to
pay
employee
benefits.
we
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
we
are
only
collecting
these
sums
your
honor
from
members.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
volkswagen
is
not
contributing
to
our
plan
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
its
stevedore
contractor
that
it
hires
under
privately
negotiated
contracts
is
the
party
contributing
to
our
fund.volkswagen
is
not
contributing
to
our
fund
because
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
your
honor,
whether
the
burden
falls
on
it,
i
don't
know
because
the
record
indicates
their
cost
of
discharge
may
have
gone
down
and
i
may
point
out
to
you
that
they
know
what
their
cost
of
discharge
are.
they
have
five
or
six,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
number,
stevedore
contractors
in
three
to
four
ports
on
the
pacific
coast
and
they
pay
them
all
a
different
figure
per
automobile
and
they
know
what
it
is
and
they
could
have
produced
the
evidence
and
they
did
not
produce
the
evidence.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
don't
know
what
savings
they've
incurred.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i've
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
at
page
627
of
the
record,
the
trial
examiner
found
that
that
was
the
case
and
based
it
upon
testimony
of
the
marine
terminals'
vice
president
which
was
adopted
by
the
pacific
coast
representative
of
volkswagen.
why
didn't
volkswagen
tell
us
what
their
cost
was
if
they
were
being
damaged?
mr.
gary
j.
torre
they're
creating
--
this
case
is
here
to
retry
and
argue
evidentiary
matters.
they
have
created
an
inference
throughout
this
case,
the
$2
and
35
cents
was
twice
the
profit
and
as
the
solicitor
says,
it
surely
brings
reality
that
we
didn't
know
the
cost
wasn't
going
up
by
$2
and
35
cents.
that
was
a
very
easy
thing
to
prove
if
it
were
true.
they
had
all
the
figures,
what
is
more
at
page
161
of
the
record
when
mr.
peter
curtis
is
testifying.
he
indicates
that
he
knows
what
all
of
the
cost
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it
certainly
does.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
price
was
higher
than
$10
and
45
cents.
i
don't
know.
it
may
have
been
but
one
thing
i
do
know
is
that
it
was
not
$12
and
80
cents
because
that's
what
the
price
they
were
collecting
per
automobile,
$10
and
45
cents
in
the
year
immediately
before
the
negotiation
of
the
plan.
a
new
cost
item,
$2
and
35
cents
was
incurred
and
i
will
certainly
say
all
cost
are
reflective
but
i
will
challenge
anyone
to
assert
or
say
that
$2
and
35
cents
was
added
to
$10
and
45
cents
to
create
a
cost
of
$12.80.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
and
i
am
certain
it
would
be
in
the
record
if
it
were
true
because
it's
available
to
volkswagen.
volkswagen
knows
what
it's
being
charged
by
stevedore
contractors
to
take
a
car
off
of
its
vessels.
these
are
--
these
contracts
are
negotiated
on
a
cost
plus
basis
and
mr.
curtis
indicates
he
knows
what
all
of
the
cost
of
his
stevedores
are,
their
membership
dues,
their
basic
wages,
their
overtime
wages,
i'm
imposing
upon
the
court
and
i'm
sorry.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
the
hearing
was
held
though.
i
think
the
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
he
had
full
opportunity
to
produce
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
i
think
he
had
a
hearing
on
section
15,
16
and
17
to
make
his
case
up.
we
sat
and
took
evidence
for
four
days.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
what
that
means
is
the
$2
and
35
cents
is
25%
of
$10
and
45cents.
$10
and
45
cents
was
the
cost
of
discharge
immediately
before
the
plan
went
into
effect.
$2
and
35
cents
is
what
the
mechanization
assessment
upon
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
can't
believe
that
the
commission
in
that
statement
is
saying
that
the
$2.35
is
25%
of
a
figure
that
was
never
put
into
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
that
the
finding
of
fact
of
the
trial
examiner
on
page
627
is
not
been
overruled
and
he
said
the
cost
decrease.
i
think
they
have
to
reconciled
statements.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
--
that's
how
this
is
ever
been
written.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
well,
i
think
they
can
be
reconciled
your
honor.
i
think
to
assume
--
i
think
that's
a
careless
statement
and
i
admit
it
caused
me
a
lot
of
trouble
obviously.
but
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
to
assume
that
the
commission
is
holding
that
the
cost
of
discharging
automobiles
went
up
25%
when
what
the
cost
of
discharging
is,
is
not
been
put
in
the
record
by
volkswagen
is
to
assume
that
the
commission
was
being
irrational.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
sir.
that
i
know
it
did
not
do.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
because
there
were
savings.
there
were
savings
that
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
purpose
of
this
plan
was
to
reduce
cost.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
to
pay
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
don't
see
any
statement
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
sir.
they
do
not.
they
pay
a
commodity
rate
to
their
stevedore.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
we
had
a
hearing
where
they
were
given
an
opportunity.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
they
didn't
put
the
evidence
in.
it
was
their
burden.
they
have
the
evidence,
it's
their
burden.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
commission
had
to
give
them
a
hearing
on
one
of
the
questions
that
they
raised
certainly
and
that
was
whether
or
not
they
--
the
stevedores
were
compelled
to
add
to
establish
rates,
a
new
cost
because
that
would've
been
price
fixing
and
they
were
given
a
hearing
to
find
out
that
they
could
prove
that
and
they
didn't
prove
it.
the
commission
says
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
evidence
proving
that.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
sir.
i
do
not
mean
that.
i
mean
that
if
we
--
if
an
allegation
is
made
in
an
area
that
is
within
the
commission's
jurisdiction,
they
have
to
give
a
hearing
certainly.
and
i
think
that
an
allegation
to
the
effect
that
we
arrange
under
the
guise
of
implementing
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
fix
the
prices
of
terminal
operators
would
raise
a
question
within
their
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
think
the
funding
of
a
collectively
bargained
labor
commitment
raises
a
question
within
their
jurisdiction.
two
challenges
have
been
presented
here.
one
was
within
their
jurisdiction,
the
other
was
not.
they've
had
a
full
hearing,
four
days
of
it,
full
briefing.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i'm
speaking
for
the
pacific
maritime
association,
the
intervenor
in
this
case
and
i
hope
i
can
clear
up
some
of
the
confusions
that
obviously
had
been
created.
i'd
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
i
think
it's
the
easiest
one,
the
answer
as
to
whether
there
is
an
ongoing
obligation
with
respect
to
the
mechanization
fund,
my
answer
is,
yes,
there
is.
the
contract
was
renegotiated
during
the
bargaining
session
that
was
concluded
last
summer
with
the
ilwu
renewed
for
an
additional
five
years.
there's
an
additional
$33
million
being
paid
in
employee
benefits,
substantially
retirement,
health
--
not
health,
disability
and
death
benefits.
the
period
of
time
over
which
it
--
while
the
contract
is
for
five
years,
the
benefits
will
be
paid
over
a
total
of
eight
years
from
last
july.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it's
at
a
slightly
higher
rate
than
$5
million
a
year
but
i'd
like
to
explain
that
the
$5
million
a
year
is
the
maximum
rate
and
it
will
never
be
and
has
--
in
the
first
three
years,
it
was
collected
at
that
rate
but
it
cannot
be
collected
at
that
rate
and
paid
out
at
that
rate,
it
will
be
--
always
the
lower
rate.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
one
of
the
benefits
that
is
known
as
the
vesting
benefit
is
essentially
--
it's
been
determined
by
the
internal
revenue
service
at
any
rate
to
be
an
early
retirement
benefit.
and
the
manner
in
which
the
plan
was
set
up,
it
was
impossible
to
fund
that
benefit
with
prior
funding
as
the
industry
wish
to
do.
they
wish
to
set
up
this
early
retirement
benefit
and
fund
it
within
the
five-year
period.
this
could
not
be
done
and
established
the
right
to
deduct
the
sums
of
money
that
were
being
put
into
the
vesting
benefit
trust.
we
have
been
compelled
in
order
to
get
the
tax
result
upon
which
the
plan
was
dependent
to
establish
what
is
known
as
a
current
payment
pension
plan.
we
only
therefore
--
therefore,
we
only
collect
the
amount
of
money
that
is
necessary
to
pay
current
vesting
benefits.
we
have
several
thousand
men
who
have
retired
and
more
are
continually
retiring
where
they
are
looking
forward
to
getting
those
who
retired
under
the
initial
plan,
$220
a
month
and
until
they've
received
approximately
$8000,
they
have
claims
against
the
trust
and
we
collect
currently
to
pay
this
benefit.
now
this
means,
since
some
men
will
retire
in
the
last
months
of
the
plan,
it
means,
we
have
to
have
provisions
where
we
will
be
collecting
three
years
later
because
it's
paid
out
over
a
three-year
term.
and
our
maximum
annual
amount
is
reduced
in
order
to
make
the
provision
for
this
later
collection.
so,
the
rates
in
the
first
three
years
were
$5
million
but
they've
gone
down
which
of
course
means
that
the
rate
on
the
tonnage
assessment
goes
down
for
everybody
who
is
subject
to
it.
also,
as
the
cargo
increases
in
volume,
the
rate
goes
down.
so
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
it
imposes
extraordinary
burdens
on
volkswagen.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
if
it
did
cause
volkswagen
to
be
burdened
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
well,
volkswagen
has
alleged
that.
they
had
a
trial
on
that
and
they
didn't
prove
that
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
but
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
trial
examiner
who
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
--
listened
to
the
evidence.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
not
because
it
is
supported
by
uncontroverted
evidence.
what
the
record
in
this
case
shows
is
that
the
cause
of
discharging
volkswagen
did
not
go
up.
the
solicitor
in
his
brief
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
there
is
but
that
difference
exist
for
everyone.
if
i
may
explain
where
that
comes
from
your
honor,
the
revenue
tons
that
a
vessel
collects
will
always
generally,
and
this
is
common
carriers,
will
always
be
computed
on
the
basis
of
weight
or
measurement
whichever
is
greater.
the
reason
they
select
whichever
is
greater
is
because
the
carrying
capacity
of
a
ship
is
limited
by
two
factors,
the
size
of
the
hold
and
the
displacement
of
the
vessel.
some
cargos,
they
do
not
take
up
as
much
space
will
be
heavier.
cargos
that
take
up
as
both
--
as
automobiles
generally,
it
isn't
just
volkswagen.
a
large
cube
will
be
lighter
in
terms
of
the
proportion
of
space
and
weight.
now,
if
a
vessel
did
not
take
the
larger
of
the
two
measures
the
result
would
be
--
while
a
cargo
that
took
up
a
lot
of
space
so
they
couldn't
carry
the
full
displacement
if
they
computed
it
on
the
revenue
tons
on
the
basis
of
weight,
the
vessel
would
have
not
been
able
to
be
compensated
for
its
carrying
capacity.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it's
10
to
1
on
an
automobile
--
on
an
automobile
generally
quicksilver,
the
weight
to
something
like
14
to
1
which
--
what
i
mean
is
that
the
weight
measurement
for
quicksilver
is
14
times
the
space
it
will
take
up
just
because
quicksilver
is
heavier.
now,
we
have
for
generation
collected
the
portion
of
our
membership
dues
that
this
association
is
charging.
incidentally,
this
is
not
a
de
minimis
item.
the
pacific
maritime
association
is
a
very
large
organization
that
deals
with
something
like
eight
unions
that
covers
the
entire
pacific
coast.
it
maintains
hiring
halls
and
very
costly
facilities
and
while
the
figure
isn't
in
the
record,
the
cost
of
running
this
association
is
quite
comparable
to
the
annual
cost
of
the
mechanization
fund.
at
any
rate,
there
is
no
basis
for
this
court
to
presume
it's
a
de
minimis
item
as
i
sat
here
hearing
this
morning.
i
can
assure
you
my
--
our
members
don't
think
so
and
there
is
some
evidence
in
this
record
that
volkswagen
doesn't
think
its
de
minimis.
their
stevedore
contractor
testified
that
the
representative
from
germany
complained
about
the
amount
of
membership
dues
that
marine
terminals
was
incurring
as
a
member
of
the
pacific
maritime
association.
they
were
incurring
it
on
a
measure
--
their
membership
dues
on
a
membership
--
on
a
measurement
basis
and
the
german
representative
wanted
it
to
be
computed
on
the
weight
basis
which
would
have
been
one
tenth,
he
would've
divided
the
due
factor
from
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
all
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
not
as
a
separate
item.
all
clause
that
our
members
incurred
whether
they
are
basic
wages,
overtime
wages,
pensions,
mechanization
cost,
membership
dues,
we
assume
our
members
take
into
account
in
their
total
cost
mix
in
figuring
what
the
rates
of
their
services
are
going
to
be.
if
they
don't,
they'll
go
broke.
there
--
this
seems
self-evident.
it
does
not
follow
that
every
member
will
take
those
clauses
into
account
in
the
same
fashion.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it
is
the
--
pardon.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
can't
say
in
the
substantial
point
as
the
volkswagen
do
because
they
account
from
66%
i
think
of
all
foreign
automobiles
imported
into
the
united
states
but
we
do
have
fiats,
renaults,
mercedes-benz,
and
rolls
royce.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
--
i
think
volkswagen
is
the
only
one
that
comes
in
by
charter,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
fiat
--
fiat
does
not
hire
stevedores.
the
ship
carrying
the
fiat
in,
hires
stevedores
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no
other
manufacturer
of
automobiles
imports
them
into
such
quantities
that
they
have
chartered
ships
that
require
them
to
hire
stevedores.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes
sir.
as
what
i
understand
that
is
so.
and
i'd
like
to
comment
on
that
at
this
moment.
you've
heard
about
how
pma
is
dominated
by
liners.
i
want
to
remind
this
court
that
the
liners
who
are
members
of
pma
that
are
important
are
matson
who
service
hawaii,
the
japanese
flag
ships,
it
service
the
pacific,
apl
which
services
the
pacific
states
line,
pfel.
the
amount
of
service
to
northern
europe
to
the
pacific,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
showing
how
much
it
is
but
it
should
be
rather
common
knowledge
that
the
liners
on
the
pacific
coast
are
servicing
the
pacific
coast
trades
and
not
the
northern
european
trade.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
probably
sir,
not
necessarily.
there
are
stevedores
on
the
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
have
the
slightest
idea.
it
depends
upon
what
is
efficiency
of
taking
a
vessel
off
--
a
car
off
of
a
vessel
will
be.
i
can
tell
you
what
his
labor
cost
are
but
i
don't
know
how
efficiently
he
uses
his
labor.
i
--
the
association
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
he
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
he
makes
the
contribution.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
--
any
employer
or
dock
workers
which
is
--
would
be
a
stevedore
contractor
or
marine
terminal.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
alright.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
if
an
association
stevedore
unloads
the
datsun,
he
will
have
a
charge
measured
by
the
volume
of
the
datsun
that
he
will
have
to
contribute
to
the
mechanization
fund.
what
the
carrier
--
who
hires
him
pays
--
i
haven't
the
slightest
idea.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
exactly.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
exactly,
yes.
in
fact,
all
general
cargo
will
be
on
the
same
cent
rate
and
it
will
be
determined
under
the
same
rule
by
which
we
collect
our
pma
dues.
now
this,
you've
heard
three
things
mentioned.
one,
the
differential
of
both
carriers
--
both
cargos,
well,
pma
tonnage
dues
have
had
that
differential
for
over
40
years.
you've
heard
scrap
metal
mentioned.
scrap
metal
is
a
bulk
cargo
the
way
in
which
it
is
loaded
today,
the
way
in
which
scrap
metal
is
handled
with
magnets
has
been
determined
to
be
a
bulk
cargo.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it
came
up
--
yes,
it
came
up
in
1959
--
1961
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
now
you've
heard
about
coastwise
lumber
which
does
have
a
special
rate.
coastwise
lumber
is
a
general
cargo
and
i'd
like
to
explain
that
because
it
is
extremely
important
that
it
be
understood
that
this
court
could
make
a
serious
error
on
--
if
it
is
not
understood.
most
of
the
carriers
and
handlers,
the
coastwise
lumber
are
all
companies
that
are
not
members
of
the
pacific
maritime
association.
they
conduct
their
own
private
negotiations
with
the
ilwu
as
do
some
other
organizations
but
it's
very
important
on
the
coastwise
lumber
to
recognize
that
they're
all,
except
one
and
it's
not
the
important
one
are
outside
of
the
association.
the
plan,
not
--
like
all
the
rest
of
the
plans
we
have
is
set
up
to
allow
those
members
of
the
industry
who
are
not
a
member
of
our
association
if
they
want
to
participate
through
their
negotiations
with
the
ilwu
who
will
be
able
to
participate
the
pension
plan,
the
welfare
plans,
the
vacation
plans,
the
mech
plan.
if
they
couldn't,
we
would
be
running
the
risk
of
running
them
out
of
business
by
cutting
them
out
of
a
facility
that
employees
would
want
the
benefits
of
it,
it
wouldn't
work
for
them.
ilwu
negotiated
a
lower
rate
than
our
rate
with
the
coastwise
lumber
people.
and
we
were
confronted
with
saying
to
nonmembers,
pay
our
rate
or
don't
participate
in
the
plan
or
reducing
the
rate.
we
reduced
the
rate.
in
other
words,
we
did
just
the
opposite
of
what
this
court
condemned
in
the
pennington
and
jewel
tea
cases.
i
think
we
had
an
obligation
to
reduce
the
rate
but
i
certainly
don't
want
to
be
condemned
for
keeping
the
plan
open
to
nonmembers
to
participate
on
rates
to
get
longshore
employees
that
they
negotiated
with
the
ilwu.
i
see
that
my
time
is
closing,
i'm
--
one
point
i
wish
to
make,
justice
fortas
asked
this
very
early
in
the
argument.
this
case
presents
as
we
have
said
in
our
briefs
and
there
is
just
no
question
of
it
in
our
mind
whether
there's
any
residual
jurisdiction
in
the
maritime
commission
to
supervise
labor
management
relations.
the
findings
of
six
--
page
637
of
this
record,
make
absolutely
clear
that
he
only
thing
pma
members
were
doing
were
implementing
a
collective
commitment
that
it
guaranteed
benefits
to
employees
and
they
were
collecting
the
money
to
pay
those
benefits.
now,
i
think
it's
a
very
usual
thing
in
america,
in
industry
wide
bargaining
today
to
set
up
industry
plans
where
you
guarantee
benefits
to
the
union
in
your
negotiation
and
you
fund
them
as
--
seems
a
reasonable
fashion
among
the
employer
group.
if
we
can't
do
that,
we're
being
treated
differently
than
the
rest
of
the
industry
in
america
and
we've
got
to
know
why
because
we
have
to
accommodate
our
entire
collective
bargaining
process
to
those
standards.
we
can't
work
this
out
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
we
--
our
bargaining
relationships
are
pretty
volatile
and
dynamic
and
we
have
to
know
when
we
go
into
our
negotiations
with
the
maritime
unions,
the
areas
where
we
can
say
yes
or
no
or
we
have
to
say
maybe
depending
upon
what
the
maritime
commission
is
going
to
say.
if
we
don't
know
that,
we're
going
to
be
charged
with
bargaining
in
bad
faith
by
these
unions
and
will
be
hold
up
before
the
nlrb
ultimately
to
have
to
defend
ourselves.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
maritime
shipping
act
that
was
intended
to
treat
the
maritime
industry
differently
than
industry
in
general
in
this
area.
so
what
i'm
really
asserting
is,
if
our
implementing,
a
fringe
benefit
program
where
we
guarantee
benefits
in
anyway
violates
an
antitrust
policy.
it
does
under
the
sherman
act
in
other
industries
too.
and
i
hope
this
court
will
appreciate
what
it
is
deciding
here.
it's
not
just
one
of
little
small
questions
affecting
one
of
the
smaller
industries.
you're
deciding
a
question
under
the
antitrust
laws
that
affect
industry
in
general
i
believe.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
never
in
the
past
your
honor
that
i
know
of,
never.
i
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
maritime
labor
board
that
existed
for
several
years
in
the
late
30s
and
ended
with
the
war
when
war
shipping
took
over
that
i've
referred
the
court
to
in
our
brief
had
a
conciliatory
jurisdiction.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it's
not.
it
has
--
its
no
longer
existent
your
honor.
but
even
then,
that
board
was
supposed
to
be
implementing
the
policies
of
the
nlra.
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
given
any
special
policies
to
implement
it.
it
was
just
--
this
was
a
time
when
you're
having
to
sit
down,
strike
some
boarded
ships
and
it
was
deprived
in
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
that's
correct
and
i
want
to
be
very
clear.
i
don't
think
we
could
immunize
a
price
fixing
scheme
by
putting
it
into
a
collective
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
--
agreement.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
i
won't
go
that
far.
i
have
to
say
in
the
labor
field,
yes,
but
speaking
generally.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
excuse
me
sir,
but
i
think
outsiders
will
suffer
an
impact
even
though
you're
fixing
the
price
of
an
insider.
i
think
that
if
you
have
a
scheme
fixing
the
price
of
terminal
operators
charging
carriers,
this
is
ultimately
going
to
affect
shippers
and
i
think
that's
all
the
commission's
talking
about
when
it's
starting
an
impact
on
outsiders.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
it's
inevitably
always
determines
that.
i
think
the
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
price
fixing
does.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
oh!
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
i
don't
think
that
agreements
that
create
cost
items
create
price
fixing
agreements.
i
quite
agree,
no,
i
don't,
no.
but
i
don't
think
they
should
have
to
be
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
--
filed
or
approved
either
but
certainly,
in
the
labor
field,
not
at
all.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
oh,
i
think
it
would
be
a
disaster.
the
--
i
hesitate
to
position
my
client
be
it
--
here
are
some
of
the
things
that
could
happen
to
us.
there
is
a
policy
of
law
that
says
that
tax
deductions
will
be
denied
if
they
violate
fundamental
public
policies.
we've
been
in
violation
if
this
is
something
that
has
to
go
back
to
the
commission.
it
will
be
going
back
to
the
commission
in
an
area
where
antitrust
is
involved
and
i
would
think
that's
a
fundamental
public
policy
and
i
think
the
commissioner
might
be
encouraged
to
want
to
start
denying
what
is
--
probably
about
$26
million
of
tax
deductions
that
have
been
taken
by
not
the
carriers,
by
their
stevedore
contractors
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
commissioner
could
prevail
on
that
suit
but
if
he
did,
it
would
mean
bankruptcy
for
many
of
them.
now,
you've
been
told
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
solicitor
that
surely
the
members
of
pma
who
have
acquiesced
in
this,
the
courts
would
let
them
lie
where
they
are
but
the
army
has
in
the
last
five
or
six
years,
i
think
moved
approximately
25%
to
30%
of
the
tonnage
that's
crossed
the
docks.
their
accounting
for
this
and
they
have
hired
stevedores
who've
incurred
cost
to
the
mechanization
fund
that
have
not
yet
been
approved
and
i
suppose
the
controller
general
could
say
to
the
army,
if
your
stevedore
charge
had
any
cost
in
there
that
the
maritime
commission
had
to
approve
and
it
wasn't
approved,
you
better
(voice
overlap)
back
again.
now,
of
course
that
money
is
all
been
collected
and
has
been
used
to
pay
benefits
to
longshoremen
and
marine
clerks.
these
are
some
of
the
questions
that
we
would
be
confronted
with.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
your
honor,
we've
always
had
been
faced
with
treble-damage
suits
and
we
avoid
them
by
staying
within
the
law
in
the
sherman
act.
whenever
an
association
of
employers
sit
down
and
make
agreements
on
a
matter
that
is
important
as
the
cost
of
maritime
labor
is
to
ultimate
charges,
somebody
can
come
along
and
challenge
it.
and
we
try
to
very
carefully
stay
within
the
law.
and
when
you
have
120
members
who
are
being
advised
by
most
of
the
law
firms
in
the
pacific
coast,
you
have
to
prove
that
you're
within
the
law
because
the

your

--
mr.

j.

your
honor,
what
we
did
here,
we've
been
doing
for
about
40
years
and
no
one
has
suggested
that
we
were
covered
by
the
shipping
act.
now,
this
cart
is
being
asked
to
take
a
law
that's
been
on
the
books
and
construe
it
in
the
fashion
that
nobody
in
this
industry
on
any
coast
has
ever
thought
applied.
now
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
we
--
this
agreement
is
no
different
than
our
dues
collection.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
this
agreement
is
no
--
is
not
a
bit
different
than
the
collection
of
dues
to
pay
for
our
expenses
except
the
money
we
collected
here,
we
used
to
pay
employee
benefits.
we
--
mr.
gary
j.

we
are
only
collecting
these
sums
your

from
members.

volkswagen
is
not
contributing
to
our
plan
your
honor.
mr.

no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
its
stevedore
contractor
that
it
hires
under
privately
negotiated
contracts
is
the
party
contributing
to
our
fund.volkswagen
is
not
contributing
to
our
fund
because
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
your
honor,
whether
the
burden
falls
on
it,
i
don't
know
because
the
record
indicates
their
cost
of
discharge
may
have
gone
down
and
i
may
point
out
to
you
that
they
know
what
their
cost
of
discharge
are.
they
have
five
or
six,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
number,
stevedore
contractors
in
three
to
four
ports
on
the
pacific
coast
and
they
pay
them
all
a
different
figure
per
automobile
and
they
know
what
it
is
and
they
could
have
produced
the
evidence
and
they
did
not
produce
the
evidence.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
don't
know
what
savings
they've
incurred.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i've
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
at
page
627
of
the
record,
the
trial
examiner
found
that
that
was
the
case
and
based
it
upon
testimony
of
the
marine
terminals'
vice
president
which
was
adopted
by
the
pacific
coast
representative
of
volkswagen.
why
didn't
volkswagen
tell
us
what
their
cost
was
if
they
were
being
damaged?
mr.
gary
j.
torre
they're
creating
--
this
case
is
here
to
retry
and
argue
evidentiary
matters.
they
have
created
an
inference
throughout
this
case,
the
$2
and
35
cents
was
twice
the
profit
and
as
the
solicitor
says,
it
surely
brings
reality
that
we
didn't
know
the
cost
wasn't
going
up
by
$2
and
35
cents.
that
was
a
very
easy
thing
to
prove
if
it
were
true.
they
had
all
the
figures,
what
is
more
at
page
161
of
the
record
when
mr.
peter
curtis
is
testifying.
he
indicates
that
he
knows
what
all
of
the
cost
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
it
certainly
does.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
price
was
higher
than
$10
and
45
cents.
i
don't
know.
it
may
have
been
but
one
thing
i
do
know
is
that
it
was
not
$12
and
80
cents
because
that's
what
the
price
they
were
collecting
per
automobile,
$10
and
45
cents
in
the
year
immediately
before
the
negotiation
of
the
plan.
a
new
cost
item,
$2
and
35
cents
was
incurred
and
i
will
certainly
say
all
cost
are
reflective
but
i
will
challenge
anyone
to
assert
or
say
that
$2
and
35
cents
was
added
to
$10
and
45
cents
to
create
a
cost
of
$12.80.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
and
i
am
certain
it
would
be
in
the
record
if
it
were
true
because
it's
available
to
volkswagen.
volkswagen
knows
what
it's
being
charged
by
stevedore
contractors
to
take
a
car
off
of
its
vessels.
these
are
--
these
contracts
are
negotiated
on
a
cost
plus
basis
and
mr.
curtis
indicates
he
knows
what
all
of
the
cost
of
his
stevedores
are,
their
membership
dues,
their
basic
wages,
their
overtime
wages,
i'm
imposing
upon
the
court
and
i'm
sorry.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
the
hearing
was
held
though.
i
think
the
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
he
had
full
opportunity
to
produce
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
i
think
he
had
a
hearing
on
section
15,
16
and
17
to
make
his
case
up.
we
sat
and
took
evidence
for
four
days.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
what
that
means
is
the
$2
and
35
cents
is
25%
of
$10
and
45cents.
$10
and
45
cents
was
the
cost
of
discharge
immediately
before
the
plan
went
into
effect.
$2
and
35
cents
is
what
the
mechanization
assessment
upon
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
can't
believe
that
the
commission
in
that
statement
is
saying
that
the
$2.35
is
25%
of
a
figure
that
was
never
put
into
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
think
that
the
finding
of
fact
of
the
trial
examiner
on
page
627
is
not
been
overruled
and
he
said
the
cost
decrease.
i
think
they
have
to
reconciled
statements.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
--
that's
how
this
is
ever
been
written.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
well,
i
think
they
can
be
reconciled
your
honor.
i
think
to
assume
--
i
think
that's
a
careless
statement
and
i
admit
it
caused
me
a
lot
of
trouble
obviously.
but
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
to
assume
that
the
commission
is
holding
that
the
cost
of
discharging
automobiles
went
up
25%
when
what
the
cost
of
discharging
is,
is
not
been
put
in
the
record
by
volkswagen
is
to
assume
that
the
commission
was
being
irrational.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
sir.
that
i
know
it
did
not
do.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
because
there
were
savings.
there
were
savings
that
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
purpose
of
this
plan
was
to
reduce
cost.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
to
pay
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
don't
see
any
statement
--
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
sir.
they
do
not.
they
pay
a
commodity
rate
to
their
stevedore.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
i
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
we
had
a
hearing
where
they
were
given
an
opportunity.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
they
didn't
put
the
evidence
in.
it
was
their
burden.
they
have
the
evidence,
it's
their
burden.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
sir.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
the
commission
had
to
give
them
a
hearing
on
one
of
the
questions
that
they
raised
certainly
and
that
was
whether
or
not
they
--
the
stevedores
were
compelled
to
add
to
establish
rates,
a
new
cost
because
that
would've
been
price
fixing
and
they
were
given
a
hearing
to
find
out
that
they
could
prove
that
and
they
didn't
prove
it.
the
commission
says
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
evidence
proving
that.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no.
mr.
gary
j.
torre
no,
sir.
i
do
not
mean
that.
i
mean
that
if
we
--
if
an
allegation
is
made
in
an
area
that
is
within
the
commission's
jurisdiction,
they
have
to
give
a
hearing
certainly.
and
i
think
that
an
allegation
to
the
effect
that
we
arrange
under
the
guise
of
implementing
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
fix
the
prices
of
terminal
operators
would
raise
a
question
within
their
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
think
the
funding
of
a
collectively
bargained
labor
commitment
raises
a
question
within
their
jurisdiction.
two
challenges
have
been
presented
here.
one
was
within
their
jurisdiction,
the
other
was
not.
they've
had
a
full
hearing,
four
days
of
it,
full
briefing.
