justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
posner,
didn't
the
commission
expressly
find
that
the
allocation
of
the
tax
would
have
no
compete
--
anticompetitive
effect
or
any
competitive
effect
on
--
among
those
who
entered
into
the
agreement
or
in
any
other
ways
as
far
as
i
could
see?
they
did
--
that
was
their
judgment
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that
argument
but
the
commission
nevertheless
said
that
absent
in
agreement
passed
on
which
you
didn't
file,
just
the
allocation
agreement
itself
would
not
affect
outsiders
and
would
not
affect
competition
and
that
is
what
you
disagree
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
knew
to
that
effect,
disagreement
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
the
--
on
assessing
the
consequences
in
disagreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
--
is
this
--
and
then
is
this
a
universal
camera
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
posner,
let's
assume
that
the
parties
had
agreed
expressly
to
do
what
happened
here,
namely,
to
--
that
in
the
case
of
automobiles
the
--
they
are
to
be
done
on
a
measurement
basis
and
the
tax
passed
on,
would
you
understand
the
--
that
the
commission
would
then
hold
that
that
agreement
was
fileable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
would
you
suppose
the
commission
would
say
that
that
affected
competition
when
it
applied
to
all
automobiles
alike.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission
said
a
showing
has
been
required
that
they
have
some
impact
upon
the
competitive
relationships
to
those
that
are
into
them.
now
that's
in
with
respect
to
15.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
--
how
do
you
suggest
that
if
that
--
if
the
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
that
--
this
--
that
the
facts
are
such
that
it
--
that
they
are
the
same
as
though
there
had
been
an
expressed
agreement
to
pass
on
the
automobile
passed.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
do
you
say
that
that
affects
some
kind
of
a
competitive
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
another
port?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
standard
is
just
an
impact
on
outsiders
not
anything
--
you
don't
need
anything
further
in
terms
of
the
impact
or
extent
of
impact
on
competition,
just
on
impact
on
outsiders,
is
that
the
commission
standard
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
i
thought
it
was
quite
clear
that
if
an
agreement
is
approved,
do
they
really
have
antitrust
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
didn't
know
that
automatically
--
that
filing
automatically
brought
an
approval.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
sure,
i
thought
the
commission
considered
that
a
competitive
factor
is
involved
in
that
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
inquired
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
this
agreement
would
be
approved?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
would
approve
it
after
considering
these
things
why
that's
the
pattern
of
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
take
it
strange
that
the
department
of
justice
would
want
to
follow
what
the
statute
requires?
justice
byron
r.
white
nobody
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
doesn't
suggest
that
as
far
as
i
know
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
the
act
doesn't
provide
for
any
exemption
for
the
antitrust
law
still
--
unless
there's
an
approval.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
you
win,
a
couple
of
damage
action
may
follow.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
would
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
takes
the
view
that
a
disagreement
had
not
only
allocated
the
burden
that
said
it
shall
be
passed
on
to
whoever
uses
the
facility
that
it
would
necessarily
be
fileable
and
if
--
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standard
does
the
--
in
testing
the
fileability
of
these
agreements
as
if
the
maritime
commission
used
in
this
case
was
the
standard
that
the
agreement
didn't
call
for
any
passing
on
that
there
was
no
expressed
calling
--
no
expressed
provision
--
for
an
impact
on
outsiders,
is
that
what
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
if
a
necessary
impact
had
to
be
that
it
would
be
passed
on
in
some
circumstance?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
that
was
so
that
the
necessary
impact
although
one
stated
was
that
it
had
to
be
passed
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
any
further
analysis
as
to
the
effect
on
competition
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
between
what
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
didn't
affect
the
competition
among
the
shippers?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
competition
among
carriers?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
among
stevedores?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
between
ports?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
15?
how
about
the
fileability
of
an
agreement
though
that
if
that's
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
katz,
do
you
agree
that
--
or
what
is
your
position
if
--
that
if
we
assume
this
court
finds
against
the
commission
on
15,
it
says
that
the
agreement
should've
been
filed.
what
should
the
court
do
about
16
and
17?
do
you
think
the
record
is
complete
and
ready
for
a
decision
on
16
and
17?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
commission
has
said
almost
to
say
about
16
and
17
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
it
was
tried
out,
both
issues
were
tried
out
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
dues
passed
on
expressly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
a
separate
item.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
torre,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
isn't
any
chance
of
holding
an
agreement
to
be
fileable
with
the
commission
unless
it
had
some
antitrust
implications?
justice
byron
r.
white
filed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
are
we
suppose
to
read
this
opinion
and
act
on
it
if
a
--
i
mean,
that's
what
it
says
that
volkswagen's
cost
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
posner,
didn't
the

expressly
find
that
the

not

and
that
is
what
you
disagree
with.
justice
byron

so
you
knew
to
that
effect,
disagreement
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
the
--
on
assessing
the
consequences
in
disagreement.
justice
byron

so
the
