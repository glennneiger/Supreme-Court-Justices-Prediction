mr.
walter
herzfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
review
the
affirmance
by
that
court
of
an
order
of
the
federal
maritime
dismi
--
commission
which
dismissed
the
complaint
of
the
present
petitioner,
volkswagenwerk
which
had
been
bought
volkswagen
in
its
capacity
as
a
large
shipper
for
the
mobiles.
the
case
raises
issues
in
the
three
provisions
of
the
shipping
act
of
1916
as
amended
sections
15,
16
and
17.
the
united
states
as
a
statutory
party
to
this
review
proceeding
has
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
petitioner
and
i
have
agreed
with
counsel
for
the
solicitor
general
here
on
a
division
of
the
argument
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
be
my
task
to
briefly
outline
the
facts
and
to
present
the
issues
arising
in
the
sections
16
and
17
of
the
shipping
act
by
counsel
for
the
solicitor
will
then
argue
the
case
with
respect
to
section
15.
my
statement
as
to
the
facts
will
rely
throughout
on
findings
of
the
commission
except
that
in
two
occasions
which
i
will
identify
them,
i
come
to
them
and
rely
on
undisputed
evidence
on
which
no
finding
was
made.
pacific
maritime
association,
the
intervener
in
the
proceedings
below
and
here
is
an
association
of
shipping
lines,
common
carriers
by
water,
stevedores
and
terminal
operators,
operating
at
the
united
states
pacific
coast.
the
purpose
of
the
association
is
to
negotiate
and
administer
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
the
various
unions
involved
in
the
shipping
industry.
in
1960
and
1961,
a
number
of
agreements
were
entered
into
--
between
pacific
maritime
associations,
the
intervener
and
international
longshoremen's
and
warehousemen's
union,
the
bargaining
representatives
of
all
the
onshore
laborers,
the
stevedoring
and
terminal
labor
on
the
pacific
coast.
the
agreements
so
far
as
here
relevant
provided
in
substance
that
the
union
would
waive
its
prior
objections
to
restrict
the
--
both
practices
and
federal
bidding
and
that
the
union
would
consent
to
the
application
by
the
employers
of
automation
and
labor-saving
devices
in
return
for
the
creation
of
the
so-called
mechanization
and
modernization
fund,
both
of
which
certain
benefits
there
to
be
paid
to
members
of
the
union.
the
mechanization
fund
under
the
agreement
was
to
reach
over
a
period
of
five
and
a
half
year
an
amount
of
altogether
$29
million,
$5
million
a
year
was
to
be
raised
for
the
period
from
--
the
beginning
of
1961
to
the
middle
of
1966.
after
these
agreements
were
entered
into
the
employer
association,
pma,
considered
the
method
by
which
the
contribution
to
the
fund
is
$5
million
contribution
should
be
raised
and
as
a
result
of
pma's
internal
procedures,
the
recommendation
by
special
committee
appointed
to
this
purpose,
recommendation
by
the
board,
both
of
the
membership
and
the
final
decision
of
the
board
of
pma
as
a
result
of
all
of
this,
a
method
was
devised
which
in
effect
provided
that
every
stevedoring
or
terminal
operator
member
of
pma
should
pay
a
certain
amount.
at
the
beginning
that
was
$27
and
a
half
cent
to
pma
for
each
ton
of
cargo
discharged
or
loaded
at
the
pacific
coast.
it
is
this
tonnage
tax
imposed
by
pma
which
is
under
attack
in
this
proceeding
so
far
as
it
applies
to
automobiles.
before
considering
the
impact
of
the
tonnage
tax
on
automobiles,
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
briefly
present
the
competitive
relationship
between
the
parties
here.
pacific
maritime
association
is
dominated
by
shipping
lines
and
common
carriers.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
by
the
vice
president
and
treasurer
of
pma
to
the
effect
that
as
long
he
was
with
the
association
for
some
19
years,
the
liners
had
the
majority
on
the
board.
there's
an
admission
in
one
of
the
earlier
briefs
by
counsel
for
pma
that
members
of
pma
are
not
philanthropist
and
that
they
vote
in
membership
meetings
in
their
own
self-interest.
without
going
any
deeper
in
the
evidence,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
if
the
liners
had
the
majority
of
the
board
and
if
that
is
the
result
of
vote
in
the
self-interest
of
the
members,
that
the
liners
have
a
dominating
position
in
pma.
there
are
substantially
more
evidence
on
this
which
i
like
to
skip
in
order
to
focus
more
quickly.
in
any
event,
we
have
made
throughout
the
contention
that
the
liners
control
pma
and
this
contention
is
been
completely
ignored
both
by
the
trial
examiner
and
by
the
commission.
it
finally
was
vindicated
in
a
footnote
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
where
the
court
summarizes
the
evidence
which
i
just
outlined
and
some
more,
and
then
very
dryly
edit.
the
trial
examiner
made
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
show
liner
domination
of
pma.
i
submit
that
undisputed
evidence
although
no
finding
established
this
right
of
fact.
the
disregard
of
this
fact
by
the
examiner
and
by
the
commission
that
was
in
the
--
first
of
four
serious
defects
which
in
my
opinion
affects
the
administrative
determination
here
and
i
will
point
out
here
the
defect
as
i
come
to
them.
while
pma
is
liner
dominated,
volkswagen
for
its
very
large
shipments
to
the
pacific
coast
uses
primarily
chartered
vessels.
obviously,
the
chartering
by
a
shipper
or
vessels
is
a
form
of
transportation
which
is
entirely
competitive
with
the
business
of
common
carriers
and
liners.
volkswagen
--
and
this
was
found
is
the
largest
shipper
of
dry
cargo
to
the
pacific
coast
on
chartered
vessels
and
obviously,
volkswagen
is
a
party
which
the
liner
interest
in
control
of
pms
do
not
precisely
like
because
all
business
which
goes
to
volkswagen
is
business
which
the
liners
are
using.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
as
i
understand
it,
a
liner
is
a
common
carrier
having
scheduled
sailings
where
there
might
be
a
common
carrier
with
sporadic
sailings.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
both
are
common
carriers.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
right.
with
this
spectrum,
i
now
approach
the
impact
of
the
tonnage
tax
to
automobiles.
and
this
is
the
second
point
where
i
find
the
administrative
proceedings
entirely
defective.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
the
case
would
be
the
same
if
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
--
common
carriers
be
in
control
of
pma.
the
second
defect
which
i
suggest
to
--
occurred
in
the
administrative
proceedings
is
that
the
most
fundamental
allegation
which
we
made
in
the
case,
the
heart
of
our
case
was
completely
ignored
both
by
the
examiner
and
by
the
commission.
according
to
the
complaint
and
according
to
our
evidence
and
our
briefs,
reports
this
proceeding
because
a
tonnage
tax
imposes
a
10
times
higher
burden
on
automobiles
than
on
other
cargo.
that
was
the
heart
of
our
case.
the
reason
why
we
went
to
the
commission
and
by
the
evidence
again,
and
this
is
entirely
undisputed
and
well
indeed
our
allegation
somewhat,
i
believe,
i
think
recognition
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
commission
and
the
examiner
studiously
avoid
it
to
refer
to
this
cause-effect
of
the
case
at
all.
without
detailing
the
evidence
to
any
great
extent,
i
just
--
will
point
out
what
it
shows
in
this
respect.
the
people
of
--
the
members
of
pacific
maritime
association
for
stevedoring
and
terminal
labor
fr
the
year
1962,
amounted
to
about
$102
million.
$5
million
was
raised
by
the
tonnage
tax,
it
follows
that
for
the
average
commodity,
the
tonnage
tax
represented
the
cost
of
a
fringe
benefit
of
5%
of
the
total
labor
cost.
the
record
shows
that
as
to
volkswagen,
the
tonnage
tax
represents
56%
of
total
labor
so
that
i'm
still
modest
if
i
claim
that
this
is
only
a
10
times
heavier
burden
on
--
as
in
on
average
general
cargo.
there's
one
last
fact
which
i
have
to
present
and
which
is
vital
in
connection
with
this
one,
namely
that
automobiles
did
not
derive
any
benefit
more
than
average
cargo
from
the
arrangement
which
led
to
the
tonnage
tax.
on
this,
one
day,
a
clear
findings
throughout,
the
examiner,
the
commission
and
the
court.
they
had
the
average
benefit
of
this
--
they
replaced
was
the
arrangement
with
the
union.
there'll
be
a
less
work
stoppages
and
slow
downs,
there
were
no
strikes.
we
were
working
in
a
much
improved
atmosphere
as
everybody
else
but
there
was
--
is
not
even
a
contention
of
any
additional
or
special
benefit
which
automobiles
derived
it
from
the
arrangement
even
though
automobiles
were
subjected
to
a
10
times
larger
tax.
that
brings
me
to
the
legal
discussion
so
far
as
i
have
undertaken
to
present
it
to
the
court.
section
17
of
the
shipping
act
provides
an
essence
that
carriers
and
other
regulated
person,
including
stevedores
and
terminal
operators,
may
not
engage
in
unreasonable
practices
and
that
it's
a
duty
of
the
commission
if
it
finds
unreasonable
practices
to
go
back
to
them
and
to
prescribe
reasonable
practices.
my
submission
is
that
a
charge
10
times
heavier
with
the
same
benefit
which
was
extended
to
all
as
a
cargo
is
on
its
face
an
unreasonable
practice.
the
commissioner
--
i'm
sorry,
the
commission
and
the
examiner
never
passed
on
this
issue
at
all.
they
refused
to
face
the
issue
on
--
under
the
pretext
that
the
petitioner
in
the
proceeding
had
challenged
only
the
practices
of
the
technical
respondent
here,
a
stevedore
who
is
serving
volkswagen
and
have
not
challenged
the
practice
of
pacific
maritime
association
and
its
members
in
devising
and
levying
this
tonnage
tax.
this
statement
that
our
attack
had
been
directed
only
against
the
stevedore
who
tried
to
pass
the
tonnage
tax
onto
us
has
no
foundation
whatsoever
in
the
reading
of
the
complaints
of
our
proposed
findings
of
our
exceptions,
of
our
briefs
which
shows
this
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
stated
again
in
a
footnote
but
very
strongly
that
it
rejected
at
the
outset
the
contention
that
our
attack
in
this
case
was
directed
only
at
the
practices
of
the
respondent
stevedore.
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
to
examine
our
contention
under
section
17
on
the
merits.
in
doing
so
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
would
not
be
necessary
but
if
the
court
have
to
agree
with
this
us
on
section
15
at
first,
a
proceeding
would
have
to
be
started
by
pma
to
get
the
agreement
approved.
and
i
believe
that
the
handling
of
the
case
in
the
commission
in
this
case
shows
that
it
would
be
vital
if
it
had
some
guidance
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
here
in
that
case.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
yes.
section
15
provides
that
the
commission
may
not
approve
an
agreement,
if
it
violates
any
other
provision
of
the
act.
so
if
the
court
as
this
matter
is
--
before
the
court,
any
of
you
should
find
that
17
or
16
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
complete
record
so
far
as
the
volkswagen
charge
goes
under
16
and
17
and
i
admit
the
court
certainly
is
not
--
would
not
be
compelled
to
pass
on
this
but
i
believe
it
would
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
certainly,
because
one
of
the
arguments
in
15
would
be
that
the
agreement
violates
as
a
provision
of
the
act.
there
would
be
evidence
but
i
assume
as
to
volkswagen
or
as
to
automobiles,
it
would
be
the
same
evidence
as
we
have
now.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
not
necessarily.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
could
determine
the
16
--
section
15
issue
just
on
the
holding
that
this
was
a
cooperative
agreement
whether
good
or
bad
or
an
agreement
regulating
competition
whether
discriminatory
or
not.
i
admit
that
depending
on
how
the
court
belieev
for
section
15,
it
may
or
may
not
refer
to
16
and
17
too
but
not
necessarily
i
believe.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
in
that
case,
i
believe
the
court
must
pass
on
16
and
17
and
it's
indeed
my
contention
that
they
would
apply.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
definitely
and
that's
the
case
where
i
believe
the
court
will
have
to
face
the
issue
which
was
based
either
by
saying,
"i
believe
as
mr.
justice
brennan's
report,
may
or
may
not
refer
to
sections
15
--
16
and
17".
but
if
he
had
not
made
a
case
under
15,
then
the
court
is
confronted
without
charge
to
say
that
any
event
is
unreasonable
and
a
discriminatory
arrangement.
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
examiner
and
the
commission
just
failed
to
consider
our
contention
under
17
on
the
grounds
which
have
no
basis
in
effect
that
we
haven't
directed
a
contention
against
pma
but
only
against
our
stevedore
and
carrier.
the
court
of
appeals
agreeing
on
this
was
asked
then
went
on
and
decided
the
section
17
issue
on
its
merits.
and
in
doing
so,
i
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
fell
into
the
error
which
had
been
pointed
out
in
this
court
by
a
decision
such
as
securities
and
exchange
commission
versus
chenery
corporation
or
more
recently,
burlington
truck
lands
versus
united
states,
namely
that
a
reviewing
--
a
court
reviewing
an
administrative
action
should
not
substitute
its
own
reasons
for
those
of
the
agency.
the
commission
which
congress
had
appointed
to
pass
in
the
first
instant
with
its
expert
knowledge
on
discretion
have
not
made
any
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
pma
arrangement
as
such
violated
17.
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
i
believe
should
not
have
reached
this
issue
--
or
but
should've
remand
it.
neither
as
it
may,
the
reason
which
the
court
gave
in
order
to
sustain
the
pma
tonnage
tax
under
section
17,
in
my
opinion
is
not
convincing.
the
thrust
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
the
effect
that
this
tonnage
tax
was
a
rough-and-ready
measure
to
resolve
a
problem
and
that
a
rough-and-ready
formula
for
the
distribution
of
charges
is
permissible
even
though
it
results
for
some
in
a
wholly
disproportionate
burden.
one
reason
which
the
court
invoked
to
support
this
was
that
a
rough-and-ready
tax
formula
might
be
desirable
and
(inaudible)
of
administrative
experience
and
of
expense
and
collection.
this
reason,
isn't
it
born
out
to
the
best
that
they
could.
pma
already
levies
a
tax
which
requires
all
stevedores
and
terminal
operators
to
file
tonnage
reports
but
the
tax
itself
is
graduated.
so,
there
is
one
charge,
$27
and
a
half
cents
in
1961
for
general
cargo.
there's
another
charge,
$5
and
a
half
cent
for
bulk
cargo
and
for
scrap
metal.
and
there
is
still
rate
for
coast
rice
cargo
and
coast
rice
transportation
and
the
lowest
of
all
is
for
lumber
and
lowest
in
the
coast
rice
trade.
now,
whether
the
stevedores
who
in
all
of
these
trades
reports
a
tonnage
then
figure
out
the
tax
at
the
rate
of
$27
and
a
half
which
is
assessed
against
volkswagen
or
at
another
rate
obviously
is
not
a
problem
which
can
create
administrative
difficulty
or
additional
expense
in
collection.
so
that
it
seems
the
second
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
attainable
in
any
event,
is
not
sustained
by
the
record.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
well,
i'm
considering
only
the
tax
which
follows
the
agreement
with
the
unions.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
(inaudible)
mr.
walter
herzfeld
the
agreement
with
the
union
itself,
i
don't
believe.
i
believe
that
the
entire
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
absolutely.
our
contention
is
that
the
agreement
as
to
the
charge
in
its
entirety,
not
only
as
to
automobiles
should've
been
filed.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
everything
which
was
done
by
pma
after
it
made
the
agreement
with
the
union
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
the
agreement
with
the
union
nearly
upholds
the
liability
of
$5
million
a
year
on
pma
and
its
members.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
that's
right.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
he
hadn't
made
any
contention
of
that
in
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
--
because
the
case
doesn't
require
it.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
well
the
civil
aeronautics
both
acting
on
--
under
a
parallel
statute,
parallel
to
section
15,
found
indeed
--
said
a
collective
bargaining
association
of
employers
as
such
had
to
file
and
it
was
formed
and
many
took
any
action.
i
believe
that
the
cases
in
the
federal
maritime
commission
would
permit
to
avoid
this
on
a
essentially
de
minimis
basis
as
--
and
quite
a
bit
of
law
in
the
commission
that
minor
division
or
secretaries
or
smaller
expenses,
does
not
require
a
filing.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
sub
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
indeed,
yes.
for
that
matter,
congress
enacted
section
15
in
1966
and
permitted
the
commission
by
general
order
to
exempt
certain
non-competitive
agreements
on
filing.
so,
i
could
imagine
that
involved
section
15
point
is
sustained,
the
commission
might
exempt
the
mere
formation
of
the
association
and
its
current
membership
views
from
filing
a
general
order
because
all
of
this
is
de
minimis
and
has
no
competitive
effect
of
any
significance.
returning
very
briefly
to
my
argument
on
17,
the
idea
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
a
rough-and-ready
formula
was
reasonable,
in
my
opinion
is
vitiated
by
this
undisputed
fact.
we
have
no
rough-and-ready
formula.
bulk
cargo
in
particular
with
a
preference
rate,
paying
only
$5
and
a
half
cents
instead
of
$27
and
a
half
for
automobiles.
and
the
reason
by
bulk
cargo
gets
this
favor
was
that
bulk
cargo
is
a
commodity
which
is
discharged
with
very
little
labor.
and
as
to
what
the
--
the
labor
expense
is
low,
why
should
this
employer
contribute
a
very
high
sum
to
the
labor
fund
--
grant
which
is
perfectly
acceptable
but
which
is
equally
applicable
to
automobiles.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
pma
left
the
rough-and-ready
formula
and
started
to
make
classifications,
bulk
cargo
has
little
labor
content,
bulk
cargo
accordingly
pays
a
lower
rate
then
it
was
compelled
if
it
acted
reasonable
to
take
the
same
attitude
as
to
automobiles.
the
record
is
(inaudible)
as
it's
showing
that
automobiles
have
a
very
low
labor
content
and
for
the
same
reason
as
bulk
cargo,
once
a
classification
is
made,
its
unreason
--
not
to
extend
it
to
automobiles.
very
briefly
to
section
16
which
prohibits
discriminatory
practices
and
undue
advantages,
here,
again,
we
just
did
not
get
our
day
in
court
in
the
commission.
the
recommission
cases
which
are
now
abandoned
into
the
effect
that
section
16,
can
it
come
into
play
only
if
it
says
discrimination,
it
might
be
competing
types
of
cargo.
we
conceded
that
the
cargo
involved
here,
automobiles,
was
treated
equally
and
we
claimed
that
there
was
a
discrimination
against
automobiles
in
favor
of
other
types
of
cargo.
having
made
this
concession
before
the
examiner,
we
urged
the
commission
to
abandon
this
competitive
cargo
requirement.
the
commission,
however,
did
not
consider
section
16
merely
on
the
account
of
our
admission
that
its
prior
cases
on
this
point
had
been
unfavorable
to
us.
what
concerns
me
very
much
is
at
the
time
we
filed
our
briefs,
the
trial
commission
cases
were
indeed
against
us
on
this.
but
then
the
commission
made
a
decision
and
refused
to
consider
our
contention
under
section
16.
it
had
already
changed
its
position
and
it
had
successfully
urged
the
second
circuit
to
abandon
this
requirement
under
section
16
that
there'd
be
discrimination
among
competing
cargos.
having
abandoned
that
position
and
this
is
our
request
that
this
issue
should
--
would
be
reconsidered.
i
believe
the
commission
did
not
do
its
duty
in
just
saying,
“volkswagen
has
relied
on
the
old
cases.
we
don't
owe
volkswagen
makes
the
examination
of
this
issue
in
the
light
of
our
new
position.”
if
i
tie
all
of
these
together
then
i
come
to
this.
the
two
most
crucial
factual
contentions
that's
--
which
he
made,
namely
that
pma
was
dominated
by
the
liners
and
that
automobiles
pay
ten
times
more
than
--
as
a
cargo
despite
undisputed
evidence
that
--
disregarded
by
the
commission.
our
two
legal
contentions
here,
section
16
and
17,
they're
also
not
considered
by
the
commission
at
all.
on
17,
the
commission
had
claimed
and
wrongly
that
our
attack
had
not
been
against
pma.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
in
our
favor.
on
16,
the
court
order
--
the
commission
held
us
to
an
alleged
admission
that
its
prior
cases
were
controlling
which
we
never
made
so
that
the
administrative
proceedings
here
suffer
from
four
fundamental
defects.
our
two
contention
that
never
been
considered
by
the
commission
and
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
urged
in
affirming
an
adjudication
which
was
made
this
way.
i
also
respectfully
submit
that
the
record
as
it
stands
now
before
the
court
affirmatively
shows
a
right
to
believe
under
sections
17
and
16.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
the
courts
would
not
be
compelled
to
rule
on
section
16
and
17
but
i
suggested
in
answer
to
a
question
from
justice
brennan
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
--
that
i
think
it
would
be
highly
desirable
if
the
court
would
express
some
opinion
on
this
because
the
question
will
come
up
again
in
the
commission
and
i
believe
the
commission
needs
the
guidance
of
this
court
in
order
to
decide
it.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
i'm
only
suggesting
it
would
be
desirable
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
--
and
sure,
the
court
doesn't
have
to.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
i
have
one
thing
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
review
the
affirmance
by

commission
which
dismissed
the
complaint
of
the
present
petitioner,
volkswagenwerk
which
had
been
bought
volkswagen
in
its
capacity
as
a
large
shipper
for
the
mobiles.
the
case
raises
issues
in
the
three
provisions
of
the
shipping
act
of
1916
as
amended
sections
15,
16
and
17.
the
united
states
as
a
statutory
party
to
this
review
proceeding
has
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
petitioner
and
i
have
agreed
with
counsel
for
the
solicitor
general
here
on
a
division
of
the
argument
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
be
my
task
to
briefly
outline
the
facts
and
to
present
the
issues
arising
in
the
sections
16
and
17
of
the
shipping
act
by
counsel
for
the
solicitor
will
then
argue
the
case
with
respect
to
section
15.
my
statement
as
to
the
facts
will
rely
throughout
on
findings
of
the
commission
except
that
in
two
occasions
which
i
will
identify
them,
i
come
to
them
and
rely
on
undisputed
evidence
on
which
no
finding
was
made.
pacific
maritime
association,
the
intervener
in
the
proceedings
below
and
here
is
an
association
of
shipping
lines,
common
carriers
by
water,
stevedores
and
terminal
operators,
operating
at
the
united
states
pacific
coast.
the
purpose
of
the
association
is
to
negotiate
and
administer
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
the
various
unions
involved
in
the
shipping
industry.
in
1960
and
1961,
a
number
of
agreements
were
entered
into
--
between
pacific
maritime
associations,
the
intervener
and
international
longshoremen's
and
warehousemen's
union,
the
bargaining
representatives
of
all
the
onshore
laborers,
the
stevedoring
and
terminal
labor
on
the
pacific
coast.
the
agreements
so
far
as
here
relevant
provided
in
substance
that
the
union
would
waive
its
prior
objections
to
restrict
the
--
both
practices
and
federal
bidding
and
that
the
union
would
consent
to
the
application
by
the
employers
of
automation
and
labor-saving
devices
in
return
for
the
creation
of
the
so-called
mechanization
and
modernization
fund,
both
of
which
certain
benefits
there
to
be
paid
to
members
of
the
union.
the
mechanization
fund
under
the
agreement
was
to
reach
over
a
period
of
five
and
a
half
year
an
amount
of
altogether
$29
million,
$5
million
a
year
was
to
be
raised
for
the
period
from
--
the
beginning
of
1961
to
the
middle
of
1966.
after
these
agreements
were
entered
into
the
employer
association,
pma,
considered
the
method
by
which
the
contribution
to
the
fund
is
$5
million
contribution
should
be
raised
and
as
a
result
of
pma's
internal
procedures,
the
recommendation
by
special
committee
appointed
to
this
purpose,
recommendation
by
the
board,
both
of
the
membership
and
the
final
decision
of
the
board
of
pma
as
a
result
of
all
of
this,
a
method
was
devised
which
in
effect
provided
that
every
stevedoring
or
terminal
operator
member
of
pma
should
pay
a
certain
amount.
at
the
beginning
that
was
$27
and
a
half
cent
to
pma
for
each
ton
of
cargo
discharged
or
loaded
at
the
pacific
coast.
it
is
this
tonnage
tax
imposed
by
pma
which
is
under
attack
in
this
proceeding
so
far
as
it
applies
to
automobiles.
before
considering
the
impact
of
the
tonnage
tax
on
automobiles,
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
briefly
present
the
competitive
relationship
between
the
parties
here.
pacific
maritime
association
is
dominated
by
shipping
lines
and
common
carriers.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
by
the
vice
president
and
treasurer
of
pma
to
the
effect
that
as
long
he
was
with
the
association
for
some
19
years,
the
liners
had
the
majority
on
the
board.
there's
an
admission
in
one
of
the
earlier
briefs
by
counsel
for
pma
that
members
of
pma
are
not
philanthropist
and
that
they
vote
in
membership
meetings
in
their
own
self-interest.
without
going
any
deeper
in
the
evidence,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
if
the
liners
had
the
majority
of
the
board
and
if
that
is
the
result
of
vote
in
the
self-interest
of
the
members,
that
the
liners
have
a
dominating
position
in
pma.
there
are
substantially
more
evidence
on
this
which
i
like
to
skip
in
order
to
focus
more
quickly.
in
any
event,
we
have
made
throughout
the
contention
that
the
liners
control
pma
and
this
contention
is
been
completely
ignored
both
by
the
trial
examiner
and
by
the
commission.
it
finally
was
vindicated
in
a
footnote
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
where
the
court
summarizes
the
evidence
which
i
just
outlined
and
some
more,
and
then
very
dryly
edit.
the
trial
examiner
made
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
show
liner
domination
of
pma.
i
submit
that
undisputed
evidence
although
no
finding
established
this
right
of
fact.
the
disregard
of
this
fact
by
the
examiner
and
by
the
commission
that
was
in
the
--
first
of
four
serious
defects
which
in
my
opinion
affects
the
administrative
determination
here
and
i
will
point
out
here
the
defect
as
i
come
to
them.
while
pma
is
liner
dominated,
volkswagen
for
its
very
large
shipments
to
the
pacific
coast
uses
primarily
chartered
vessels.
obviously,
the
chartering
by
a
shipper
or
vessels
is
a
form
of
transportation
which
is
entirely
competitive
with
the
business
of
common
carriers
and
liners.
volkswagen
--
and
this
was
found
is
the
largest
shipper
of
dry
cargo
to
the
pacific
coast
on
chartered
vessels
and
obviously,
volkswagen
is
a
party
which
the
liner
interest
in
control
of
pms
do
not
precisely
like
because
all
business
which
goes
to
volkswagen
is
business
which
the
liners
are
using.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
as
i
understand
it,
a
liner
is
a
common
carrier
having
scheduled
sailings
where
there
might
be
a
common
carrier
with
sporadic
sailings.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
both
are
common
carriers.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
right.
with
this
spectrum,
i
now
approach
the
impact
of
the
tonnage
tax
to
automobiles.
and
this
is
the
second
point
where
i
find
the
administrative
proceedings
entirely
defective.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
the
case
would
be
the
same
if
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
--
common
carriers
be
in
control
of
pma.
the
second
defect
which
i
suggest
to
--
occurred
in
the
administrative
proceedings
is
that
the
most
fundamental
allegation
which
we
made
in
the
case,
the
heart
of
our
case
was
completely
ignored
both
by
the
examiner
and
by
the
commission.
according
to
the
complaint
and
according
to
our
evidence
and
our
briefs,
reports
this
proceeding
because
a
tonnage
tax
imposes
a
10
times
higher
burden
on
automobiles
than
on
other
cargo.
that
was
the
heart
of
our
case.
the
reason
why
we
went
to
the
commission
and
by
the
evidence
again,
and
this
is
entirely
undisputed
and
well
indeed
our
allegation
somewhat,
i
believe,
i
think
recognition
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
commission
and
the
examiner
studiously
avoid
it
to
refer
to
this
cause-effect
of
the
case
at
all.
without
detailing
the
evidence
to
any
great
extent,
i
just
--
will
point
out
what
it
shows
in
this
respect.
the
people
of
--
the
members
of
pacific
maritime
association
for
stevedoring
and
terminal
labor
fr
the
year
1962,
amounted
to
about
$102
million.
$5
million
was
raised
by
the
tonnage
tax,
it
follows
that
for
the
average
commodity,
the
tonnage
tax
represented
the
cost
of
a
fringe
benefit
of
5%
of
the
total
labor
cost.
the
record
shows
that
as
to
volkswagen,
the
tonnage
tax
represents
56%
of
total
labor
so
that
i'm
still
modest
if
i
claim
that
this
is
only
a
10
times
heavier
burden
on
--
as
in
on
average
general
cargo.
there's
one
last
fact
which
i
have
to
present
and
which
is
vital
in
connection
with
this
one,
namely
that
automobiles
did
not
derive
any
benefit
more
than
average
cargo
from
the
arrangement
which
led
to
the
tonnage
tax.
on
this,
one
day,
a
clear
findings
throughout,
the
examiner,
the
commission
and
the
court.
they
had
the
average
benefit
of
this
--
they
replaced
was
the
arrangement
with
the
union.
there'll
be
a
less
work
stoppages
and
slow
downs,
there
were
no
strikes.
we
were
working
in
a
much
improved
atmosphere
as
everybody
else
but
there
was
--
is
not
even
a
contention
of
any
additional
or
special
benefit
which
automobiles
derived
it
from
the
arrangement
even
though
automobiles
were
subjected
to
a
10
times
larger
tax.
that
brings
me
to
the
legal
discussion
so
far
as
i
have
undertaken
to
present
it
to
the
court.
section
17
of
the
shipping
act
provides
an
essence
that
carriers
and
other
regulated
person,
including
stevedores
and
terminal
operators,
may
not
engage
in
unreasonable
practices
and
that
it's
a
duty
of
the
commission
if
it
finds
unreasonable
practices
to
go
back
to
them
and
to
prescribe
reasonable
practices.
my
submission
is
that
a
charge
10
times
heavier
with
the
same
benefit
which
was
extended
to
all
as
a
cargo
is
on
its
face
an
unreasonable
practice.
the
commissioner
--
i'm
sorry,
the
commission
and
the
examiner
never
passed
on
this
issue
at
all.
they
refused
to
face
the
issue
on
--
under
the
pretext
that
the
petitioner
in
the
proceeding
had
challenged
only
the
practices
of
the
technical
respondent
here,
a
stevedore
who
is
serving
volkswagen
and
have
not
challenged
the
practice
of
pacific
maritime
association
and
its
members
in
devising
and
levying
this
tonnage
tax.
this
statement
that
our
attack
had
been
directed
only
against
the
stevedore
who
tried
to
pass
the
tonnage
tax
onto
us
has
no
foundation
whatsoever
in
the
reading
of
the
complaints
of
our
proposed
findings
of
our
exceptions,
of
our
briefs
which
shows
this
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
stated
again
in
a
footnote
but
very
strongly
that
it
rejected
at
the
outset
the
contention
that
our
attack
in
this
case
was
directed
only
at
the
practices
of
the
respondent
stevedore.
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
to
examine
our
contention
under
section
17
on
the
merits.
in
doing
so
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
would
not
be
necessary
but
if
the
court
have
to
agree
with
this
us
on
section
15
at
first,
a
proceeding
would
have
to
be
started
by
pma
to
get
the
agreement
approved.
and
i
believe
that
the
handling
of
the
case
in
the
commission
in
this
case
shows
that
it
would
be
vital
if
it
had
some
guidance
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
here
in
that
case.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
yes.
section
15
provides
that
the
commission
may
not
approve
an
agreement,
if
it
violates
any
other
provision
of
the
act.
so
if
the
court
as
this
matter
is
--
before
the
court,
any
of
you
should
find
that
17
or
16
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
complete
record
so
far
as
the
volkswagen
charge
goes
under
16
and
17
and
i
admit
the
court
certainly
is
not
--
would
not
be
compelled
to
pass
on
this
but
i
believe
it
would
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
certainly,
because
one
of
the
arguments
in
15
would
be
that
the
agreement
violates
as
a
provision
of
the
act.
there
would
be
evidence
but
i
assume
as
to
volkswagen
or
as
to
automobiles,
it
would
be
the
same
evidence
as
we
have
now.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
not
necessarily.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
could
determine
the
16
--
section
15
issue
just
on
the
holding
that
this
was
a
cooperative
agreement
whether
good
or
bad
or
an
agreement
regulating
competition
whether
discriminatory
or
not.
i
admit
that
depending
on
how
the
court
belieev
for
section
15,
it
may
or
may
not
refer
to
16
and
17
too
but
not
necessarily
i
believe.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
in
that
case,
i
believe
the
court
must
pass
on
16
and
17
and
it's
indeed
my
contention
that
they
would
apply.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
definitely
and
that's
the
case
where
i
believe
the
court
will
have
to
face
the
issue
which
was
based
either
by
saying,
"i
believe
as
mr.
justice
brennan's
report,
may
or
may
not
refer
to
sections
15
--
16
and
17".
but
if
he
had
not
made
a
case
under
15,
then
the
court
is
confronted
without
charge
to
say
that
any
event
is
unreasonable
and
a
discriminatory
arrangement.
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
examiner
and
the
commission
just
failed
to
consider
our
contention
under
17
on
the
grounds
which
have
no
basis
in
effect
that
we
haven't
directed
a
contention
against
pma
but
only
against
our
stevedore
and
carrier.
the
court
of
appeals
agreeing
on
this
was
asked
then
went
on
and
decided
the
section
17
issue
on
its
merits.
and
in
doing
so,
i
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
fell
into
the
error
which
had
been
pointed
out
in
this
court
by
a
decision
such
as
securities
and
exchange
commission
versus
chenery
corporation
or
more
recently,
burlington
truck
lands
versus
united
states,
namely
that
a
reviewing
--
a
court
reviewing
an
administrative
action
should
not
substitute
its
own
reasons
for
those
of
the
agency.
the
commission
which
congress
had
appointed
to
pass
in
the
first
instant
with
its
expert
knowledge
on
discretion
have
not
made
any
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
pma
arrangement
as
such
violated
17.
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
i
believe
should
not
have
reached
this
issue
--
or
but
should've
remand
it.
neither
as
it
may,
the
reason
which
the
court
gave
in
order
to
sustain
the
pma
tonnage
tax
under
section
17,
in
my
opinion
is
not
convincing.
the
thrust
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
the
effect
that
this
tonnage
tax
was
a
rough-and-ready
measure
to
resolve
a
problem
and
that
a
rough-and-ready
formula
for
the
distribution
of
charges
is
permissible
even
though
it
results
for
some
in
a
wholly
disproportionate
burden.
one
reason
which
the
court
invoked
to
support
this
was
that
a
rough-and-ready
tax
formula
might
be
desirable
and
(inaudible)
of
administrative
experience
and
of
expense
and
collection.
this
reason,
isn't
it
born
out
to
the
best
that
they
could.
pma
already
levies
a
tax
which
requires
all
stevedores
and
terminal
operators
to
file
tonnage
reports
but
the
tax
itself
is
graduated.
so,
there
is
one
charge,
$27
and
a
half
cents
in
1961
for
general
cargo.
there's
another
charge,
$5
and
a
half
cent
for
bulk
cargo
and
for
scrap
metal.
and
there
is
still
rate
for
coast
rice
cargo
and
coast
rice
transportation
and
the
lowest
of
all
is
for
lumber
and
lowest
in
the
coast
rice
trade.
now,
whether
the
stevedores
who
in
all
of
these
trades
reports
a
tonnage
then
figure
out
the
tax
at
the
rate
of
$27
and
a
half
which
is
assessed
against
volkswagen
or
at
another
rate
obviously
is
not
a
problem
which
can
create
administrative
difficulty
or
additional
expense
in
collection.
so
that
it
seems
the
second
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
attainable
in
any
event,
is
not
sustained
by
the
record.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
well,
i'm
considering
only
the
tax
which
follows
the
agreement
with
the
unions.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
(inaudible)
mr.
walter
herzfeld
the
agreement
with
the
union
itself,
i
don't
believe.
i
believe
that
the
entire
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
absolutely.
our
contention
is
that
the
agreement
as
to
the
charge
in
its
entirety,
not
only
as
to
automobiles
should've
been
filed.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
everything
which
was
done
by
pma
after
it
made
the
agreement
with
the
union
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
the
agreement
with
the
union
nearly
upholds
the
liability
of
$5
million
a
year
on
pma
and
its
members.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
that's
right.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
he
hadn't
made
any
contention
of
that
in
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
--
because
the
case
doesn't
require
it.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
well
the
civil
aeronautics
both
acting
on
--
under
a
parallel
statute,
parallel
to
section
15,
found
indeed
--
said
a
collective
bargaining
association
of
employers
as
such
had
to
file
and
it
was
formed
and
many
took
any
action.
i
believe
that
the
cases
in
the
federal
maritime
commission
would
permit
to
avoid
this
on
a
essentially
de
minimis
basis
as
--
and
quite
a
bit
of
law
in
the
commission
that
minor
division
or
secretaries
or
smaller
expenses,
does
not
require
a
filing.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
sub
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
indeed,
yes.
for
that
matter,
congress
enacted
section
15
in
1966
and
permitted
the
commission
by
general
order
to
exempt
certain
non-competitive
agreements
on
filing.
so,
i
could
imagine
that
involved
section
15
point
is
sustained,
the
commission
might
exempt
the
mere
formation
of
the
association
and
its
current
membership
views
from
filing
a
general
order
because
all
of
this
is
de
minimis
and
has
no
competitive
effect
of
any
significance.
returning
very
briefly
to
my
argument
on
17,
the
idea
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
a
rough-and-ready
formula
was
reasonable,
in
my
opinion
is
vitiated
by
this
undisputed
fact.
we
have
no
rough-and-ready
formula.
bulk
cargo
in
particular
with
a
preference
rate,
paying
only
$5
and
a
half
cents
instead
of
$27
and
a
half
for
automobiles.
and
the
reason
by
bulk
cargo
gets
this
favor
was
that
bulk
cargo
is
a
commodity
which
is
discharged
with
very
little
labor.
and
as
to
what
the
--
the
labor
expense
is
low,
why
should
this
employer
contribute
a
very
high
sum
to
the
labor
fund
--
grant
which
is
perfectly
acceptable
but
which
is
equally
applicable
to
automobiles.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
pma
left
the
rough-and-ready
formula
and
started
to
make
classifications,
bulk
cargo
has
little
labor
content,
bulk
cargo
accordingly
pays
a
lower
rate
then
it
was
compelled
if
it
acted
reasonable
to
take
the
same
attitude
as
to
automobiles.
the
record
is
(inaudible)
as
it's
showing
that
automobiles
have
a
very
low
labor
content
and
for
the
same
reason
as
bulk
cargo,
once
a
classification
is
made,
its
unreason
--
not
to
extend
it
to
automobiles.
very
briefly
to
section
16
which
prohibits
discriminatory
practices
and
undue
advantages,
here,
again,
we
just
did
not
get
our
day
in
court
in
the
commission.
the
recommission
cases
which
are
now
abandoned
into
the
effect
that
section
16,
can
it
come
into
play
only
if
it
says
discrimination,
it
might
be
competing
types
of
cargo.
we
conceded
that
the
cargo
involved
here,
automobiles,
was
treated
equally
and
we
claimed
that
there
was
a
discrimination
against
automobiles
in
favor
of
other
types
of
cargo.
having
made
this
concession
before
the
examiner,
we
urged
the
commission
to
abandon
this
competitive
cargo
requirement.
the
commission,
however,
did
not
consider
section
16
merely
on
the
account
of
our
admission
that
its
prior
cases
on
this
point
had
been
unfavorable
to
us.
what
concerns
me
very
much
is
at
the
time
we
filed
our
briefs,
the
trial
commission
cases
were
indeed
against
us
on
this.
but
then
the
commission
made
a
decision
and
refused
to
consider
our
contention
under
section
16.
it
had
already
changed
its
position
and
it
had
successfully
urged
the
second
circuit
to
abandon
this
requirement
under
section
16
that
there'd
be
discrimination
among
competing
cargos.
having
abandoned
that
position
and
this
is
our
request
that
this
issue
should
--
would
be
reconsidered.
i
believe
the
commission
did
not
do
its
duty
in
just
saying,
“volkswagen
has
relied
on
the
old
cases.
we
don't
owe
volkswagen
makes
the
examination
of
this
issue
in
the
light
of
our
new
position.”
if
i
tie
all
of
these
together
then
i
come
to
this.
the
two
most
crucial
factual
contentions
that's
--
which
he
made,
namely
that
pma
was
dominated
by
the
liners
and
that
automobiles
pay
ten
times
more
than
--
as
a
cargo
despite
undisputed
evidence
that
--
disregarded
by
the
commission.
our
two
legal
contentions
here,
section
16
and
17,
they're
also
not
considered
by
the
commission
at
all.
on
17,
the
commission
had
claimed
and
wrongly
that
our
attack
had
not
been
against
pma.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
in
our
favor.
on
16,
the
court
order
--
the
commission
held
us
to
an
alleged
admission
that
its
prior
cases
were
controlling
which
we
never
made
so
that
the
administrative
proceedings
here
suffer
from
four
fundamental
defects.
our
two
contention
that
never
been
considered
by
the
commission
and
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
urged
in
affirming
an
adjudication
which
was
made
this
way.
i
also
respectfully
submit
that
the
record
as
it
stands
now
before
the
court
affirmatively
shows
a
right
to
believe
under
sections
17
and
16.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
the
courts
would
not
be
compelled
to
rule
on
section
16
and
17
but
i
suggested
in
answer
to
a
question
from
justice
brennan
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
--
that
i
think
it
would
be
highly
desirable
if
the
court
would
express
some
opinion
on
this
because
the
question
will
come
up
again
in
the
commission
and
i
believe
the
commission
needs
the
guidance
of
this
court
in
order
to
decide
it.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
i'm
only
suggesting
it
would
be
desirable
--
mr.
walter
herzfeld
--
and
sure,
the
court
doesn't
have
to.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
walter
herzfeld
i
have
one
thing
--
