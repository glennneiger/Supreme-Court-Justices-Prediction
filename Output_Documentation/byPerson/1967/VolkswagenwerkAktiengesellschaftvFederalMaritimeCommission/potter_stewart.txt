but
don't
you
think
that
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
15
that
we
would
have
to
say
some
things
that
would
bear
heavily
on
16
and
17
even
if
we
didn't
get
to
them
expressly.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
gather
mr.
posner,
that's
on
the
premise
that
there's
already
a
full
record?
if
this
had
to
go
back,
because
i
asked
mr.
herzfeld
before,
because
the
agreement
was
a
fileable
agreement,
might
there
not
be
a
difference
or
additional
record
that
bears
on
16
to
17
made
in
that
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
not
but
end
up
in
just
an
advisory
opinion
if
there
is
a
different
record
made
on
the
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
original
agreement
creating
pma?
justice
potter
stewart
for
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
industry
wide
collective
bargaining
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
any
way
in
that
area,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
anticompetitive,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
did
--
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
prevent
the
unions
from
a
so-called
“whipsaw
collective
bargaining”,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
cab
certainly
took
a
different
view
back
20
years
ago,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
mr.
katz,
its
just
a
matter
of
a
factual
inquiry
whether
this
is
still
going
on
by
its
original
terms
if
it's
to
expire
about
now
after
the
accumulation
of
about
the
$29
million?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
very
well,
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
the
commission
itself
has
changed
its
mind
since
its
decision
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
necessity
of
having
a
competitive
freight
under
16,
has
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
hold
out
your
right.
but
at
least
there
has
been
enough
of
a
shift
in
the
position
so
that
makes
him
appropriate
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
commission
itself
should
reconsider
this
case
under
16
in
light
of
its
--
at
least
partial
shift
to
position.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
commission
is
perhaps
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
consider
--
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
still
have
the
rate
of
$5
million
a
year?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
this?
they
come
from
europe
and
through
the
panama
canal,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
when
there
--
when
it
does
happen,
what
is
your
member
assessed,
say
for
adoption
or
some
other
japanese
probability.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
much
more
a
reason
with
that
determination
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
are
they
complaining
about
for
heaven's
sake?
