justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
herzfeld,
is
there
a
difference
between
a
liner
and
a
common
carrier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
are
both
--
they're
both
common
carrier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
distinguished,
you
say,
from
a
chartered
carrier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
herzfeld,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
section
15,
would
it
be
necessary
to
reach
the
17
or
16
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
section
17
and
16.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
again
in
section
15
proceeding,
might
there
not
be
considerations
that
the
--
in
the
way
of
other
evidence
that
might
be
brought
before
the
commission
that
might
make
a
16
or
17
expression
from
us
premature?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
wouldn't
it
--
would
there
on
a
section
15
proceeding
perhaps
be
evidence
that
might
bear
on
the
application
of
16
or
17?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
already?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
united
states
here
mr.
katz?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
maritime
commission
but
i
gather
mr.
posner
is
speaking
for
someone
else
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
united
states
is
--
your
opposing
that
as
at
least
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
to
suggest
if
it's
not
a
submittable
agreement
then
the
parties
to
it
might
be
vulnerable
to
antitrust
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
real
question
for
us
to
decide
is
whether
you
like
it
or
not,
the
act
requires
you
to
act
on
this
agreement,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
the
commission
be
receptive
if
pma
had
come
in
and
said
we
want
approval
of
this
agreement?
would
you
have
been
receptive
of
passing
on
it
in
order
to
give
them
the
approval
or
to
give
them
the
exemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
you
mr.
katz.
i
thought
you
said
earlier,
pma
had
come
in
and
sought
approval
in
order
to
protect
themselves
against
antitrust
prosecution
that
treble
down
the
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
may
--
i
thought
you
have
said,
if
they
had
done
that,
they
might
have
got
their
approval.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you're
receptive
to
a
request
for
an
approval,
it
seems
to
me
that
of
itself
establishes
that
indeed
it's
an
agreement
of
false
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
between
--
a
competition
between
charter,
hire
and
common
carriers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
didn't
really
cover
that
much
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
thought
about
the
competition
between
the
parties
to
the
agreement,
that's
all
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
talked
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
you
concede
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
commissioner
patterson
(ph)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
commission
--
so
how
do
you
really
deal
this
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
they
became
significant
if
we
were
to
say
that
this
was
a
fileable
agreement
therefore
you
had
to
go
through
a
procedure
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
wonder.
there's
something
of
a
primary
jurisdiction
problem
involved
and
whether
we
should
decide
the
16
and
17
on
this
record
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
15?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
torre,
is
there
a
correlation
in
the
sense
that
the
space
taken
by
a
volkswagen
could
carry
nine
times
as
much
heavy
stuff
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
is
that
the
correlation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
they
come
by
common
carrier
or
by
charter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
fiat
coming
by
common
carrier
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
-
at
the
same
time
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
about
their
law
--
there
are
something
else
that
does
hire
stevedores?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
torre,
even
if
they
don't
come
in
by
charter,
one
of
your
members
must
have
some
part
that
is
--
is
not
in
the
unloading
of
a
liner
or
of
a
carrier
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
he
make
a
contribution
to
this
fund?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
makes
the
contribution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
does?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
now.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
you
bring
a
lot
of
japanese
automobiles
coming
in.
volkswagen
is
going
to
have
the
hump
itself
i
gather
with
the
competition
of
japanese
cars
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
isn't
it?
and
they
apparently
come
in
on
common
carriers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
somebody
has
to
pay
an
assessment,
does
he
not
in
your
association
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
charge
of
unloading
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
concerned
with
that.
but
the
assessment
to
the
fund
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
collected
by
your
association
is
on
precisely
the
same
basis
for
the
datsun
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
it
is
for
the
volkswagen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
really
--
let
us
assume
--
you
can't
concede
of
the
situation
that
wouldn't
have
antitrust
implications
if
the
agreement
is
held
fileable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
commission's
standard
for
fileability
or
it's
--
or
if
its
standard
should
be
that
just
impact
on
outsiders
requires
filing,
that
doesn't
necessarily
raise
some
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
habeas
antitrust
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
that
that
shouldn't
be
the
test
for
fileability
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
doesn't
necessarily
raise
an
antitrust
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
agree
with
that
but
not
just
--
not
just
any
kind
of
a
general
cost
item
that
would
necessarily
raise
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
question
of
service
outside
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
you
say
earlier
mr.
torre
that
they'd
go
bankrupt
if
they
didn't
reflect
in
their
cost
to
service
to
volkswagen,
the
$2
and
35
cent
assessment
that
stevedoring
member
has
to
pay
to
your
association.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
perhaps
they're
absorbing
the
--
the
stevedore
is
the
one
who
was
committed
to
make
the
contribution,
isn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
torre,
certainly
marine
terminals
charges
volkswagen
a
price
that
must
include
the
$2
and
35
cents
per
unit,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
25?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
his
sentence
in
the
commission's
report
means
mr.
torre?
this
form
of
assessment
increased
volkswagen's
cost
of
discharge
some
25%.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
which
one
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
one
do
we
believe?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
there
a
difference
between
a

and
a

are
both
--
they're
