chief

may
i
interrupt

a
moment
to
ask
you,
is
that
difference
between
a
liner
and
a
common
carrier
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
does
it
--
chief

why
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
either.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
herzfeld,
if
the
court
should
hold
that
this
agreement
does
not
require
to
be
filed
under
15,
would
that
change
your
argument
or
would
your
argument
be
that
16
and
17
still
apply?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
would
apply
even
though
15
did
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
herzfeld,
do
you
--
you
answered
me
that
as
i
recall
it
that
in
the
event
the
court
felt
that
the
--
this
agreement
need
not
be
filed
that
16
and
17
would
be
before
us.
suppose
the
court
was
to
find
that
it
was
necessary
to
file
under
section
15,
would
the
merits
of
the
case
then
be
before
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
give
you
an
advisory
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
posner,
may
i
--
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
that
may
i
ask
you
that
question,
in
the
event
we
should
decide
that
this
agreement
should
have
been
filed
under
15.
should
we
reach
16
--

earl
warren
mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
--
to
mr.
justice
brennan
that
if
the
association
had
presented
this
agreement
to
the
commission,
the
commission
could
or
could
not
in
his
discretion
have
considered
the
validity
of
it
in
relation
to
the
antitrust
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
--
is
that
filing
of
the
fact
that
if
--
what
you
believe
brings
you
under
the
universal
camera
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
on
which
the
whole
thing
is
based
rather
than
on
finding
of
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?

earl
warren
carnation
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren

it
remanded
the

to
do
whatever
is
necessary
in
such
a
situation.
what
damage
would
--
what
injury
would
your
people
suffer
from
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
danger
be
a
much
greater
than
to
--
it
would
be
faced
with
the
possibility
of
a
treble-damage
suits
in
the
event
that
we
decide
the
other
way?
