mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
it
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
almost
certain
that
the
same
issues
under
16
and
17
will
recur
in
the
section
15
proceeding
and
since
they
are
ripe
for
decision
now
and
a
full
record
has
been
made
by
them,
i
think
it
would
be
completely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
indicate
its
view
on
the
application
of
those
provisions.
indeed,
if
the
court
found
in
section
16
and
17
had
been
violated,
it
would
then
be
clear
that
the
commission
could
not
approve
the
agreement
under
section
15
because
may
not
approve
an
agreement
that
violates
the
act.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
there
might
indeed
and
we
would
see
no
impropriety
to
the
commissions
taking
additional
evidence
relating
to
the
16
and
17
issues.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
were
to
suggest
some
principles
to
guide
section
16
and
17
controversies
it
would
then
simplify
the
remanded
proceedings
and
perhaps
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
conceivably
and
we
are
not
pressing
for
that
course.
it
would
however
avoid
the
necessity
for
a
second
proceeding
which
the
identical
issues
came
back
to
the
court.
now,
i
shall
address
myself
briefly
to
this
issue
whether
the
agreement
must
be
filed
under
section
15
and
two
issues
are
involved
in
this.
the
first
and
quite
the
simpler,
is
whether
looking
solely
to
the
policies
of
the
shipping
act,
an
agreement
of
this
sort
ought
to
be
filed.
and
the
second
and
more
difficult
is
whether
bringing
into
the
picture
the
policies
of
--
policies
relating
to
labor
relations
and
collective
bargaining.
some
special
exemption
should
be
recognized
here
because
of
the
labor
relations
implications.
now,
the
section
15
requires
the
filing
of
every
agreement
which
among
other
things
regulates
competition
or
gives
special
advantages
or
provides
for
a
preferential
arrangement
or
in
any
manner
provides
very
cooperative
working
arrangement.
and
i
think
it
is
common
ground
among
the
parties
here
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
subject
to
administrative
scrutiny
and
force
into
the
open
all
concerted
action
in
the
shipping
industry
which
might
invade
the
interest
protected
by
the
shipping
act
foremost
among
them
the
protection
of
shippers.
and
when
as
here,
the
terminal
companies
and
shipping
lines
dominating
the
entire
west
coast
get
together
and
agree
upon
a
quite
substantial
tax
on
tonnage
handle
in
order
to
establish
this
$30
million
mechanization
fund.
this
is
plainly
an
agreement
that
can
have
a
very
large
impact
on
shippers
and
therefore
the
commission
should
look
at
it
in
advance.
if
the
fact
did
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
don't
suggest
that
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
need
be
filed.
in
a
moment,
i
will
explain
our
view
of
the
relationship
between
labor
relation
agreements
and
the
scope
of
section
15.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
says
nothing
about
how
the
maritime
affirms
the
employers
shall
raise
the
$30
million
fund.
the
agreement
among
themselves
establishing
this
tonnage
tax
is
wholly
separate
and
the
union
disclaimed
any
control
over
how
that
was
done
and
it's
only
the
latter
agreement
that
we
say
should
be
filed.
as
mr.
herzfeld
has
urged
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
agreement
created
the
maritime
association
as
a
instrumentality
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
for
collective
bargaining.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
collective
bargaining.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
we
assumed
that
although
an
argument
could
be
made
at
the
formation
of
a
multi-employer
group
for
bargaining
is
something
the
commission
should
be
concerned.
we
assume
for
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
is
a
form
of
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
but
we
assume
that
the
propriety
of
multi-employer
units
presents
a
collective
bargaining
issue
and
that
the
maritime
commission
was
not
intended
to
supervise
the
process
of
collective
bargaining.
so
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
has
and
it
is
conceivable
that
in
a
case
which
presented
the
issue,
the
court
might
reach
the
same
result.
but
here,
we
need
to
go
so
far
to
say
that
the
maritime
firms
had
to
get
the
commission's
permission
to
bargain
as
a
unit
because
here,
it's
not
the
multi-employer
bargaining
that
is
an
issue
at
all.
it
is
simply
a
quite
separate
agreement
among
the
members
of
the
association
as
to
how
to
raise
a
particular
fund.
they
would
--
they
decided
to
do
so
by
placing
a
tax
on
each
ton
of
cargo
handled.
and
as
mr.
herzfeld
has
argued,
it
is
certainly
possible,
it
is
the
argument
that
this
is
a
punitive
measure
directed
against
volkswagen
by
reason
of
its
use
of
private
charter
vessels
instead
of
the
lines
represented
in
the
maritime
association.
whether
this
is
true
or
not,
we
don't
know
at
this
stage
but
it
suggests
that
they
are
the
kind
of
dangers
here
which
are
traditionally
associated
with
collective
boycotts
and
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
evil
that
led
to
the
shipping
act
into
the
filing
requirement
of
section
15.
now,
there's
--
some
concern
has
been
expressed
that
if
this
agreement
must
be
filed
because
of
its
impact
on
shippers,
every
cooperative
agreement
among
shipping
firms
must
be
filed
and
that
of
course
is
the
literal
force
of
the
act
and
that
i
don't
think
there
would
necessarily
be
anything
shocking
or
unmanageable
about
that.
i
don't
know
how
many
cooperative
arrangements
there
are
in
the
industry.
but
in
any
event,
the
commission
thus
have
power
under
the
act
and
has
already
by
regulation
established
categories
of
agreements
which
because
of
their
minimal
impact
on
shipping
act
policies
need
not
be
filed
and
the
commission
could
certainly
deal
with
this
type
of
agreement
in
that
fashion.
but
this
agreement
which
establishes
this
$30
million
fund
and
which
involves
this
very
direct
and
palpable
effect
on
the
charges
that
the
shipper
pays.
it
can't
be
equated
to
a
secretarial
pool
or
the
other
examples
of
trivial
agreements.
it
can't
possibly
be
led
out
by
some
kind
of
a
de
minimis
excetion
to
section
15.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
actual
critical
finding
of
the
commission
on
this
point
which
we
don't
dispute
although
one
could,
is
that
there
was
no
agreement,
no
further
agreement
among
the
members
of
the
association
to
impose
--
to
pass
on
the
tonnage
assessment
to
the
shipper.
that
is
they
didn't
say
terminal
company,
you
must
collect
this
charge
or
you
may
collect
this
charge
from
the
shipper
but
if
--
we
view
that
as
a
meaningless
formalism
because
in
the
shipping
industry
as
in
every
industry,
prices,
fares
are
determined
according
to
cost.
and
when
the
furnisher
of
the
services,
the
terminal
company
is
--
incurs
a
very
large
cost
in
relation
to
the
charge,
relation
to
other
cost,
$2
and
35
cents
out
of
a
total
charge
of
$10
and
45
cents.
that
cost
has
to
effect
in
some
way
the
shippers'
rates.
it
can't
be
absorbed
by
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
i
--
that
seems
to
me
just
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
well,
it
just
--
it
seems
to
us
and
there
is
no
analysis
in
the
commission
opinion
which
would
contradict
this.
it
is
just
patently
unsound
to
assume
that
at
least
where
there
are
some
competitions
among
terminal
operators.
they
are
somehow
going
to
absorb
a
heavy
new
cost
item
so
it
has
to
affect
shippers.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don't
think
so
because
the
commission
adopted
a
--
it
seems
to
me
not
a
factual
but
a
legal
ruling
that
the
--
that
section
15
simply
has
no
impact
unless
there
is
--
unless
shippers
are
expressly
subjected
to
the
burdens
of
an
agreement.
that
is
their
ruling,
limiting
the
scope
of
section
15.
we
say
that
that's
an
unreal
limitation.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
definitely.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
there
are
two
separate
points
being
mixed
up
here.
when
the
commission
discussed
the
bearing
of
section
16
which
prescribes
unreasonable
preferences
and
prejudices,
it
said
that
that
only
applies
to
competitive
cargos.
but
on
section
15,
it
said
that
any
agreement
must
be
filed
which
has
an
impact
on
shippers
but
it
seems
to
believe
that
an
agreement
only
has
an
impact
on
shippers
when
shippers
are
expressly
involved
any
agreement.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
the
--
there,
it
would
be
referring
to
the
members
of
the
association
itself.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
anytime
once
the
price
of
a
service
one
is
offering
is
changed
when
the
price
of
unloading
volkswagen
rises
or
fails
to
decline
as
much
as
it
would
but
for
the
assessment,
there
can
be
a
competitive
impact.
maybe
that
volkswagen
will
cease
to
use
these
terminal
operators.
it
will
open
its
--
or
that
it
will
switch
its
patronage
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
common
carriers
or
another
port.
so
as
long
as
it
is
clear,
as
it
is
perfectly
clear
here
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
trivial
item,
a
dollar
a
month
dues
to
the
association,
something
that
couldn't
have
any
effect
on
what
shippers
pay
in
their
--
regardless
of
whether
there
is
an
agreement
to
impose
this
burden
on
volkswagen,
there
is
going
to
be
some
effect
inevitably.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
commission
articulated
that
standard
but
seems
to
have
adopted
the
view
which
i
think
is
clearly
unsound
that
if
there
is
no
agreement
which
mentions
an
outsider,
the
outsider
is
not
affected
and
we
think
that
highly
unrealistic.
i
just
want
to
mention
very
briefly
return
to
the
question
of
the
bearing
of
labor
policies
on
this
case.
i
have
said
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
even
the
agreement
to
form
a
multi-employer
association
and
bargained
as
one,
is
not
in
our
view
a
concern
of
the
commission.
its
concern
arises
only
where
after
the
agreement
is
made,
the
employers
work
out
a
method
of
raising
this
--
the
benefit
provided
in
the
agreement,
in
a
fashion
that
may
affect
the
interest
protected
by
the
shippers
--
shipping
act.
the
respondents
have
objected
to
the
one
we
draw
by
suggesting
that
if
under
our
view,
the
parties
need
do
--
to
insolate
this
from
the
commission
scrutiny
as
to
put
the
allocation
formula
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
but
we
don't
suggest
that
that
would
be
decisive
even
if
the
method
of
allocation
were
provided
by
agreement.
one
would
still
have
to
ask,
was
there
a
substantial
collective
bargaining
interest
in
the
--
of
the
union
or
was
this
simply
a
guise
for
avoiding
the
commission's
scrutiny.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
it
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
almost
certain
that
the
same
issues
under
16
and
17
will
recur
in
the
section
15
proceeding
and
since
they
are
ripe
for
decision
now
and
a
full
record
has
been
made
by
them,
i
think
it
would
be
completely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
indicate
its
view
on
the
application
of
those
provisions.
indeed,
if
the
court
found
in
section
16
and
17
had
been
violated,
it
would
then
be
clear
that
the
commission
could
not
approve
the
agreement
under
section
15
because
may
not
approve
an
agreement
that
violates
the
act.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
there
might
indeed
and
we
would
see
no
impropriety
to
the
commissions
taking
additional
evidence
relating
to
the
16
and
17
issues.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
were
to
suggest
some
principles
to
guide
section
16
and
17
controversies
it
would
then
simplify
the
remanded
proceedings
and
perhaps
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
conceivably
and
we
are
not
pressing
for
that
course.
it
would
however
avoid
the
necessity
for
a
second
proceeding
which
the
identical
issues
came
back
to
the
court.
now,
i
shall
address
myself
briefly
to
this
issue
whether
the
agreement
must
be
filed
under
section
15
and
two
issues
are
involved
in
this.
the
first
and
quite
the
simpler,
is
whether
looking
solely
to
the
policies
of
the
shipping
act,
an
agreement
of
this
sort
ought
to
be
filed.
and
the
second
and
more
difficult
is
whether
bringing
into
the
picture
the
policies
of
--
policies
relating
to
labor
relations
and
collective
bargaining.
some
special
exemption
should
be
recognized
here
because
of
the
labor
relations
implications.
now,
the
section
15
requires
the
filing
of
every
agreement
which
among
other
things
regulates
competition
or
gives
special
advantages
or
provides
for
a
preferential
arrangement
or
in
any
manner
provides
very
cooperative
working
arrangement.
and
i
think
it
is
common
ground
among
the
parties
here
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
subject
to
administrative
scrutiny
and
force
into
the
open
all
concerted
action
in
the
shipping
industry
which
might
invade
the
interest
protected
by
the
shipping
act
foremost
among
them
the
protection
of
shippers.
and
when
as
here,
the
terminal
companies
and
shipping
lines
dominating
the
entire
west
coast
get
together
and
agree
upon
a
quite
substantial
tax
on
tonnage
handle
in
order
to
establish
this
$30
million
mechanization
fund.
this
is
plainly
an
agreement
that
can
have
a
very
large
impact
on
shippers
and
therefore
the
commission
should
look
at
it
in
advance.
if
the
fact
did
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
don't
suggest
that
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
need
be
filed.
in
a
moment,
i
will
explain
our
view
of
the
relationship
between
labor
relation
agreements
and
the
scope
of
section
15.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
says
nothing
about
how
the
maritime
affirms
the
employers
shall
raise
the
$30

the
agreement
among
themselves
establishing
this
tonnage

is
wholly

disclaimed
any

how
that
was

it's

mr.
richard
a.
posner

mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
we
assumed
that
although
an
argument
could
be
made
at
the
formation
of
a
multi-employer
group
for
bargaining
is
something
the
commission

--
mr.

it
is
a

of

mr.
richard

yes.
but
we
assume
that
the

units
presents
a
collective
bargaining
issue
and
that
the
maritime
commission
was
not
intended

so
--
mr.
richard

it
has
and
it
is
conceivable
that
in
a
case
which
presented
the
issue,
the

might
reach
the
same

but
here,
we
need
to
go
so
far
to
say
that
the
maritime
firms
had
to
get
the
commission's
permission
to
bargain
as
a

because
here,
it's
not
the

at

it
is
simply
a
quite
separate
agreement
among
the
members
of

they

charter
vessels
instead
of
the
lines
represented
in
the
maritime
association.
whether
this
is
true
or
not,
we
don't
know
at
this
stage
but
it
suggests
that
they
are
the
kind
of
dangers
here
which
are
traditionally
associated
with
collective
boycotts
and
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
evil
that
led
to
the
shipping
act
into
the
filing
requirement
of
section
15.
now,
there's
--
some
concern
has
been
expressed
that
if
this
agreement
must
be
filed
because
of
its
impact
on
shippers,
every
cooperative
agreement
among
shipping
firms
must
be
filed
and
that
of
course
is
the
literal
force
of
the
act
and
that
i
don't
think
there
would
necessarily
be
anything
shocking
or
unmanageable
about
that.
i
don't
know
how
many
cooperative
arrangements
there
are
in
the
industry.
but
in
any
event,
the
commission
thus
have
power
under
the
act
and
has
already
by
regulation
established
categories
of
agreements
which
because
of
their
minimal
impact
on
shipping
act
policies
need
not
be
filed
and
the
commission
could
certainly
deal
with
this
type
of
agreement
in
that
fashion.
but
this
agreement
which
establishes
this
$30
million
fund
and
which
involves
this
very
direct
and
palpable
effect
on
the
charges
that
the
shipper
pays.
it
can't
be
equated
to
a
secretarial
pool
or
the
other
examples
of
trivial
agreements.
it
can't
possibly
be
led
out
by
some
kind
of
a
de
minimis
excetion
to
section
15.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
actual
critical
finding
of
the
commission
on
this
point
which
we
don't
dispute
although
one
could,
is
that
there
was
no
agreement,
no
further
agreement
among
the
members
of
the
association
to
impose
--
to
pass
on
the
tonnage
assessment
to
the
shipper.
that
is
they
didn't
say
terminal
company,
you
must
collect
this
charge
or
you
may
collect
this
charge
from
the
shipper
but
if
--
we
view
that
as
a
meaningless
formalism
because
in
the
shipping
industry
as
in
every
industry,
prices,
fares
are
determined
according
to
cost.
and
when
the
furnisher
of
the
services,
the
terminal
company
is
--
incurs
a
very
large
cost
in
relation
to
the
charge,
relation
to
other
cost,
$2
and
35
cents
out
of
a
total
charge
of
$10
and
45
cents.
that
cost
has
to
effect
in
some
way
the
shippers'
rates.
it
can't
be
absorbed
by
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
i
--
that
seems
to
me
just
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
well,
it
just
--
it
seems
to
us
and
there
is
no
analysis
in
the
commission
opinion
which
would
contradict
this.
it
is
just
patently
unsound
to
assume
that
at
least
where
there
are
some
competitions
among
terminal
operators.
they
are
somehow
going
to
absorb
a
heavy
new
cost
item
so
it
has
to
affect
shippers.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don't
think
so
because
the
commission
adopted
a
--
it
seems
to
me
not
a
factual
but
a
legal
ruling
that
the
--
that
section
15
simply
has
no
impact
unless
there
is
--
unless
shippers
are
expressly
subjected
to
the
burdens
of
an
agreement.
that
is
their
ruling,
limiting
the
scope
of
section
15.
we
say
that
that's
an
unreal
limitation.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
definitely.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
there
are
two
separate
points
being
mixed
up
here.
when
the
commission
discussed
the
bearing
of
section
16
which
prescribes
unreasonable
preferences
and
prejudices,
it
said
that
that
only
applies
to
competitive
cargos.
but
on
section
15,
it
said
that
any
agreement
must
be
filed
which
has
an
impact
on
shippers
but
it
seems
to
believe
that
an
agreement
only
has
an
impact
on
shippers
when
shippers
are
expressly
involved
any
agreement.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
the
--
there,
it
would
be
referring
to
the
members
of
the
association
itself.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
anytime
once
the
price
of
a
service
one
is
offering
is
changed
when
the
price
of
unloading
volkswagen
rises
or
fails
to
decline
as
much
as
it
would
but
for
the
assessment,
there
can
be
a
competitive
impact.
maybe
that
volkswagen
will
cease
to
use
these
terminal
operators.
it
will
open
its
--
or
that
it
will
switch
its
patronage
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
common
carriers
or
another
port.
so
as
long
as
it
is
clear,
as
it
is
perfectly
clear
here
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
trivial
item,
a
dollar
a
month
dues
to
the
association,
something
that
couldn't
have
any
effect
on
what
shippers
pay
in
their
--
regardless
of
whether
there
is
an
agreement
to
impose
this
burden
on
volkswagen,
there
is
going
to
be
some
effect
inevitably.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
commission
articulated
that
standard
but
seems
to
have
adopted
the
view
which
i
think
is
clearly
unsound
that
if
there
is
no
agreement
which
mentions
an
outsider,
the
outsider
is
not
affected
and
we
think
that
highly
unrealistic.
i
just
want
to
mention
very
briefly
return
to
the
question
of
the
bearing
of
labor
policies
on
this
case.
i
have
said
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
even
the
agreement
to
form
a
multi-employer
association
and
bargained
as
one,
is
not
in
our
view
a
concern
of
the
commission.
its
concern
arises
only
where
after
the
agreement
is
made,
the
employers
work
out
a
method
of
raising
this
--
the
benefit
provided
in
the
agreement,
in
a
fashion
that
may
affect
the
interest
protected
by
the
shippers
--
shipping
act.
the
respondents
have
objected
to
the
one
we
draw
by
suggesting
that
if
under
our
view,
the
parties
need
do
--
to
insolate
this
from
the
commission
scrutiny
as
to
put
the
allocation
formula
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
but
we
don't
suggest
that
that
would
be
decisive
even
if
the
method
of
allocation
were
provided
by
agreement.
one
would
still
have
to
ask,
was
there
a
substantial
collective
bargaining
interest
in
the
--
of
the
union
or
was
this
simply
a
guise
for
avoiding
the
commission's
scrutiny.
