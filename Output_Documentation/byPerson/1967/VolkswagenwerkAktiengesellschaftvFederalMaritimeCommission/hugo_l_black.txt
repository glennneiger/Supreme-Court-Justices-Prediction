may
i
ask
you
if
(voice

--
justice

--
of
the
way
you
are
operating
this
plan
is
because
it
took
all
an
extraordinary
burden
on
volkswagen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i'm
talking
about
is
it
seems
that
at
least
the
argument
seems
to
be
implicit
if
not
stated
open.
what
this
does
is
to
use
a
plan,
works
alright
for
some
but
falls
to
such
a
heavy
burden
on
volkswagen
that
it
puts
the
burden
on
it
that
is
practically
impossible
for
it
to
bear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
who
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
held
--
they
didn't
prove
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
might
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
might
be
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
--
it
has
been
charged
some
other
way
than
the
way
you
charged
it.
if
you
charge
it
one
way
on
the
basis
of
weight
and
one
way
on
the
basis
of
finding,
there's
a
tremendous
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
send
them
into
the
pacific
coast?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
collecting
at
all
for
the
members
like
you
collect
their
dues,
the
members
(voice

justice
hugo
l.

well,
if
the

is
volkswagen
a
member?
justice
hugo

(inaudible)
the
one
the
burden
falls
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
had
been
applied
to
be
filed
that
under
section
16,
would
the
commission
have
been
compelled
to
hold
a
hearing
and
determine
whether
or
not
he
may
impose
exceptional
burdens
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you're
arguing,
that
--
and
you
get
that
passed
on
by
the
commission,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
hearing
on
that

under
the
6

sections

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
this
hearing
under
section
15?
justice
hugo

but
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
it
did
go
up,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.

doesn't
it
go
up
whether
the
amount
that
you
had
to
pay
the
stevedore
for
this
fund?
justice
hugo
l.

why
it
didn't
it?
because
(voice
