mr.
charles
l.
owens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
make
just
two
observations
at
the
onset
as
two
of
counsel's
observations
concerning
certain
language
in
our
brief.
he
first
of
all
states
that
the
respondent
concedes
that
after
--
that
prior
to
the
time
that
woods
testified
at
preliminary
hearing,
there
was
an
agreement
of
some
sort
made
between
the
prosecution
and
woods
that
woods
would
testify
for
the
state
in
return
for
something
we
don't
know
exactly
what.
we
don't
concede
this.
we
point
this
out.
we
just
state
this
as
a
statement
of
facts
to
use
the
word
concede
seems
to
indicate
that
we
well
to
intimate
that
there
is
something
inherently
wrong
with
this.
i
suggest
that
there
is
not.
it's
a
very
common
occurrence
for
the
prosecution
and
for
the
government
or
the
state
to
make
an
agreement
with
a
co-defendant
to
testify,
indicates
that
that's
the
only
way
possible
that
you
can
have
a
prosecution.
so
we
don't
--
we
suggest
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
this.
secondly,
we
perhaps
used
some
inappropriate
language
in
our
brief
as
the
counsel
notes
that
we
say
that
it
could
be
at
parts
where
it
was
ineffective
then
it's
because
he
chose
to
be
ineffective.
we
meant
of
course
that
if
this
could
be
construed
to
be
ineffective,
his
waiver
of
the
cross-examination
then
of
course
he
was
ineffective.
also
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
make
some
concessions.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
rather
unique
question
as
this
court
realizes,
otherwise
i
would
not
be
here
i'm
sure,
not
that
the
question
of
confrontation
of
witnesses
as
unique
with
this
court.
you
had
it
before
you
on
several
occasions
and
not
this
precise
question.
at
first
glance,
i
think
this
seems
rather
strange
that
this
is
a
rather
unique
question
because
the
right
of
confrontation
is
so
very
basic
and
fundamental.
but
i
think
when
you
consider
it
briefly,
you'll
understand
why,
i
understand
why
and
that's
because
the
states
and
the
government,
prosecutions
for
the
state
and
the
united
states
government
recognize
that
this
is
a
very
basic
and
fundamental
right.
consequently
there
are
very
few
times
in
which
the
occasion
arises
that
an
accused
will
not
be
confronted
at
trial
by
the
face-to-face
by
the
witnesses
against
him.
we
have
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes
sir.
that's
my
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
at
trial.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
you
mean
at
trial?
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes
certainly,
he
could
cross-examine
there.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes,
i
think
preliminary
hearing
and
trial
are
two
different
things.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
certainly
not.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
suggest
that
it
did.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
in
oklahoma
at
least,
under
the
decisions
of
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
this
area
where
they
have
held
before
in
similar
cases
that
where
witnesses
aren't
available
at
the
trial
and
he
has
been
available
at
preliminary
hearing
where
the
counsel
has
had
a
full
and
adequate
opportunity
to
cross-examine
and
he
is
unavailable
at
trial,
then
the
transcript
is
admissible.
i
think
a
counsel
in
oklahoma
goes
into
preliminary
hearing.
he
is
presumed
to
know
the
rules
of
the
--
the
rulings
of
this
court
of
criminal
appeals.
i
think
he
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
i
think
he
is--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
he
is
presumed
to
take
the
calculated
risk
of
either
cross-examining
him
or
risking
the
possibility
that
this
witness
might
die
or
for
some
other
reason
be
unavailable
at
trial.
i
think
he
on
the
one
hand
from
my
experience
on
both
sides
of
the
counsel
table,
on
the
one
hand,
he,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
said,
suggested,
that
it
may
not
wish
to
show
his
hand
at
preliminary
hearing
and
he
could
easily
show
his
hand
to
his
questions
on
cross-examination.
he
could
indicate
what
his
defense
later
would
be
at
trial.
many
defense
counsel
do
not
wish
to
ask
any
questions
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
i
agree
with
this.
on
the
other
hand,
he
takes
the
calculated
risk
in
oklahoma.
he
has
it
up
to
this
point
that
perhaps
this
witness
would
not
be
available.
he
has
got
to
choose
or
decide
at
that
point
whether
he
will
cross-examine
or
simply
remain
silent.
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes,
certainly.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
really
don't
know
for
sure,
your
honor.
the
record,
there
is
a
little
blank
in
there
as
you've
probably
seen.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
he
was
--
apparently,
an
agreement
was
reached
between
the
prosecution
that
he
would
not
be
prosecuted
in
the
state
court
in
return
for
his
testimony.
he
was
prosecuted
later
in
the
federal
court
for
some
other
crime.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
the
record
again
is
silent
there.
i
simply
don't
know.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no
sir.
there
is
none.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
have
set
out
the
date
i
believe
in
my
brief
between
the
preliminary
examination
and
the
time
that
the
defendant,
petitioner
here
came
on
for
trial.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
don't
believe
we
have
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
exact
date.
i
could
be
in
error
but
i
don't
recall
this.
i'm
sure
i
did
not
set
it
out
in
my
brief.
i
didn't
find
it
there.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
you
mean
the
length
of
time
after
the
preliminary
hearing
that
they
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
it
could
be.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
believe
not
sir.
first
of
all
--
as
i
read
the
counsel's
brief
and
as
i
listened
to
his
argument
today,
i
think
he
suggested
four
basic
points.
i
think
first
of
all,
he
suggests
that
the
case
of
pointer
versus
texas
should
be
strictly
construed,
i
think
in
favor
of
the
accused.
i
think
he
suggests
that
an
accused
is
entitled
to
be
confronted
by
his
witnesses
face-to-face
at
trial
and
that
is
where
we
part
ways.
i
think
to
use
--
to
make
that
interpretation
of
pointer
would
be
to
make
meaningless
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black
who
spoke
for
this
court
in
pointer.
mr.
justice
black
said
this
and
i
quote
from
the
pointer
case,
“the
case
before
us
would
be
quite
different.
it
would
be
a
quite
different
one
had
phillips
statement
and
then
taken
out
of
full
pledged
hearing
at
which
petitioner
had
been
represented
by
counsel
who
had
been
given
a
complete
and
adequate
opportunity
to
cross-examine.”
i
fail
to
see
how
we
can
interpret
pointer
to
mean
that
this
witness
must
appear
later
in
trial.
otherwise,
this
language
would
be
meaningless.
the
complete
and
adequate
opportunity
to
cross-examine
i
think
is
all
that
pointer
requires,
that's
our
case.
this
was
a
full
and
complete
preliminary
hearing.
in
fact,
this
witness
woods
was,
the
record
shows,
cross-examined
by
counsel
representing
one
of
the
other
co-defendants.
parks
said,
the
opportunity
to
do
this
and
as
i
mentioned,
suggested
a
minute
ago,
for
some
reason,
he
did
not.
i'm
not
sure
whether
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
ti
probably
is
about
50/50,
your
honor
from
experience
and
from
my
practice,
i
think
i'd
exercise
the
right
about
50%
of
the
time.
it
depends
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
i
think
if
this
can
be
shown
this
is
the
exception.
the
prosecution
cannot
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
certainly,
the
prosecution
i
suggest
could
not
do
anything
to
intentionally
make
the
witness
unavailable.
he
must
be
accidentally
unavailable
or
unfortunately
unavailable.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i'm
not
sure
mr.
chief
justice
that
they
released
him
to
the
federal
government.
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
simply
--
if
this
is
a
typical
case,
it
would
be
one
in
which
the
prosecution
made
an
agreement
with
him
that
he
would
testify
for
the
state
in
return
for
which
they
would
not
prosecute
him
or
would
work
out
some
recommended
sentence.
in
this
case,
evidently
in
return
for
the
promise
not
to
prosecute
at
that
stage,
they
would
release
him
until
trial
and
i
think
probably
this
is
what
happened
here.
they
released
him
and
in
the
meantime,
he
was
wanted
by
the
federal
officials
for
violations
of
some
federal
law.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
so.
again,
i
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no,
i
think
simply
releasing
him
is
not
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
as
i
was
going
to
point
out
in
my
concluding
remarks,
i
think
perhaps
to
be
quite
candid
with
the
court,
the
state's
most
difficult
part
of
defending
this
is
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
there
was
probably
no
effort
made
to
secure
the
release
from
the
federal
penitentiary.
i
don't
know
why.
i
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
perhaps
the
prosecutor
looked
at
--
looked
to
the
procedure,
looked
to
the
federal
statutes
and
it's
not
there.
at
least
i've
not
been
able
to
find
it.
there
are
certain
statutes
that
deal
with
the
transfer
of
federal
prisoners
and
so
forth
which
to
my
way
of
thinking
indicates
that
the
inclusion
of
one
excludes
all
others.
i've
forgotten
the
latin
phrase
for
that,
but
there
is
a
procedure
where
the
attorney
general
due
to
his
directive
presence
may
release
a
federal
prisoner
to
any
institution,
including
a
state
institution
and
they
very
often
do
this.
they
release
federal
prisoners
to
serve
out
certain
portions
of
state
sentences
or
to
be
prosecuted
in
the
state
courts.
but
i
have
not
run
across
a
statute
or
a
case
in
point
where
they
have
released
federal
prisoners
to
--
for
the
purpose
of
testifying
against
another
in
the
state
proceeding.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
don't
think
you
can
gather
that
from
the
record
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
we
must
assume
that
they
had
best
intentions
of
calling
him
at
trial,
but
in
the
meantime,
he
was
arrested
by
federal
officials
and
convicted
and
sent
to
prison,
federal
prison.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
or
should
--
i
don't
think
the
court
should
indulge
in
the
conjecture
that
the
state
intended
to
--
that
he
would
not
be
there
at
trial.
i
think
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
perhaps
i'm
basing
my
answer
on
personal
experience,
but
this
is
often
done
in
oklahoma
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes
and
i
think
this
is
usually
one
of
the
concessions.
he
--
this
man
is
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
jail.
in
oklahoma,
let
me
point
out,
robbery
with
firearms
which
this
was
is
a
capital
offense,
no
matter
if
any
one's
killed.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes.
a
bail
may
be
denied,
often
is.
it's
punishable
by
death
in
the
electric
chair.
this
is
what
he
was
charged
with.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
and
very
often,
one
of
the
concessions
made
by
the
state
is
the
agreement
that
we
will
let
you
out
pending
the
trial.
you'll
be
free
and
we'll
call
you
when
this
case
is
set
out
for
trial
and
you'll
testify
then.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
it's
not
a
practice,
no.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no,
i
mean
it's
a
practice
when
one
of
these
arrangements
is
worked
out
between
an
accused
and
the
state,
one
of
the
concessions
that
the
state
usually
makes
is
to
release
him
pending
trial.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
in
return
for
his
testimony.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
agree
with
this.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
as
far
as
the
state
knew
at
the
time
they
did
retain
possession.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
it
simply
is
not.
we
just
have
to
reason
i
think
in
the
case
like
this,
i
don't
think
we
should
presume
that
the
state
did
wrong.
i
think
we
should
presume
and
make
the
other
presumption.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
from
my
experience,
it's
been
very
hard.
i
--
maybe
impossible
to
get
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
well,
i've
never
been
on
the
prosecution
side
at
trial.
i've
been
on
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
well,
i've
been
on
the
defense
side
at
the
trial.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i've
never
been
a
prosecutor
in
a
trial.
i've
read
many
records
and
i
draw
on
that.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
don't
know.
likely,
i
think
probably
the
reasonable
thing
to
assume
is
that
this
prosecutor
knew
that
he
could
not
get
him
out
of
the
federal
penitentiary.
probably
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
suggest
that
he'd
probably
would
not
have
that.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
as
i
said
a
minute
ago,
i
have
looked
at
the
statutes
and
i'm
not
able
to
find
one
there.
there
is
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
the
case
is
under
this
one
section
of
title
xvii
that
i've
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
they
are
all
cases
where
the
federal
authorities
release
federal
prisoners
from
the
federal
penitentiaries
to
a
state
to
serve
a
portion
of
the
some
unexpired
state
sentence,
that
kind
of
thing
in
the
prisoner
complains
that
you
can't
do
that
to
me
and
the
case
is
on
hold
that
this
is
a
matter
of
comity
and
you
can't
complain
about
where
you
serve
your
sentence.
but
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
testificandum?
i
think
so
but
i've
not
seen
one
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
it
means
to
bring
the
person
before
the
court
to
testify.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
but
it's
from
my
review
of
the
decisions
on
this
point,
it
merely
to
bring
a
prisoner
from
a
federal
penitentiary
or
somewhere
to
testify
before
this
federal
court
who
wants
--
before
whom
the
writ
is
pending.
not
to
bring
him
before
that
court
to
send
him
to
a
state
court,
i
have
not
found
a
case
like
that.
apparently,
the
counsel
has
not
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
to
testify
in
a
federal
prosecution?
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes.
i
think
a
federal
court
could
and
has
i
think
in
the
case
that
counsel
points
out,
a
california
or
new
york
court
sends
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
to
new
york
court
or
vice
versa
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
perhaps
it
might
have
to.
i
haven't
seen
a
case.
the
cases
i've
seen
were
from
--
were
the
ones
in
which
a
federal
court
in
aid
of
its
own
jurisdiction
obtained
a
witness
to
testify
before
it
and
not
to
testify
before
some
other
court,
perhaps
he
could.
i
don't
know
but
i
don't
find
a
case
like
this
and
i
searched
diligently
for
one.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
that
is
my
point,
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
second
contention
of
counsel
as
i
read
his
brief
and
as
i
listened
to
his
argument
and
that
is
that
counsel
cannot
waive
his
right
of
confrontation
for
his
client.
and
i
suggest
in
our
brief
that
this
is
not
like
some
rights
that
counsel
cannot
waive.
this
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
tactical
decision
on
the
part
of
the
counsel
as
the
manager
of
his
client's
lawsuit.
i
think
the
very
reason
that
an
accused
must
have
counsel
is
the
reason
that
he
must
exercise
certain
decisions
as
this,
whether
to
cross-examine
a
witness
or
things
in
that
nature
are
purely
tactical.
as
i
suggested
before,
his
strategy
in
this
particular
case
maybe
to
not
cross-examine
because
he
does
not
want
to
show
his
hand
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings.
i
don't
think
the
defendant
can
later
complain
that
he
didn't
personally
authorize
his
attorney
to
waive
the
right
of
confrontation.
to
indulge
in
this
reasoning
would
be
to
make
any
criminal
prosecution
endless.
there
will
always
be
a
question
of,
if
counsel
have
done
this
or
have
not
done
this
at
trial,
perhaps,
that
would
have
been
a
different
result,
but
this
is
not
the
test
of
effective
counsel
which
the
counsel
also
raises
here.
the
test
is
not
whether
by
hindsight,
we
can
examine
the
record
and
conclude
that
a
different
procedure
might
have
resulted
and
brought
about
a
different
result,
a
more
favorable
result.
again,
i
think
the
very
reason
that
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
to
represent
him
at
every
stage
of
the
criminal
process
is
the
reason
that
the
same
counsel
must
be
given
the
right
to
make
certain
waivers
or
to
exercise
his
discretion
as
to
tactics.
i
would
suggest
in
conclusion
that
this
court
has
stated
on
occasion
that
certainly,
rights
such
as
the
right
of
confrontation
of
witnesses
is
a
basic
right,
but
you
have
also
stated
and
i'd
like
to
quote
a
certain
language
from
the
case
of
mattox
versus
united
states
which
is
the
case
that
is
cited
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
pointer
case
in
which
he
said
that
general
rules
of
law
of
this
kind
are
ever
beneficent
in
their
operation
and
valuable
to
the
accused
must
occasionally
give
way
to
considerations
of
public
policy
and
the
necessities
of
the
case.
the
law
in
its
wisdom
declares
that
the
rights
of
the
public
shall
not
be
wholly
sacrificed
in
order
that
an
incidental
benefit
maybe
preserved
to
the
accused.
i
suggest
that
this
was
one
of
those
cases
where
the
petitioner
was
denied
face-to-face
confrontation
at
the
trial,
but
he
had
been
once
given
confrontation
at
a
preliminary
hearing
where
he
had
been
represented
by
the
counsel
who
had
been
afforded
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
i
think
this
is
all
that
the
pointer
requires
and
i
think
pointer
should
be
limited
to
its
particular
facts.
if
there
are
no
questions,
that's
all
my
presentation.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
make
just
two
observations
at
the
onset
as
two
of
counsel's
observations
concerning
certain
language
in
our
brief.
he
first
of
all
states
that
the
respondent
concedes
that
after
--
that
prior
to
the
time
that
woods
testified
at
preliminary
hearing,
there
was
an
agreement
of
some
sort
made
between
the
prosecution
and
woods
that
woods
would
testify
for
the
state
in
return
for
something
we
don't
know
exactly
what.
we
don't
concede
this.
we
point
this
out.
we
just
state
this
as
a
statement
of
facts
to
use
the
word
concede
seems
to
indicate
that
we
well
to
intimate
that
there
is
something
inherently
wrong
with
this.
i
suggest
that
there
is
not.
it's
a
very
common
occurrence
for
the
prosecution
and
for
the
government
or
the
state
to
make
an
agreement
with
a
co-defendant
to
testify,
indicates
that
that's
the
only
way
possible
that
you
can
have
a
prosecution.
so
we
don't
--
we
suggest
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
this.
secondly,
we
perhaps
used
some
inappropriate
language
in
our
brief
as
the
counsel
notes
that
we
say
that
it
could
be
at
parts
where
it
was
ineffective
then
it's
because
he
chose
to
be
ineffective.
we
meant
of
course
that
if
this
could
be
construed
to
be
ineffective,
his
waiver
of
the
cross-examination
then
of
course
he
was
ineffective.
also
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
make
some
concessions.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
rather
unique
question
as
this
court
realizes,
otherwise
i
would
not
be
here
i'm
sure,
not
that
the
question
of
confrontation
of
witnesses
as
unique
with
this
court.
you
had
it
before
you
on
several
occasions
and
not
this
precise
question.
at
first
glance,
i
think
this
seems
rather
strange
that
this
is
a
rather
unique
question
because
the
right
of
confrontation
is
so
very
basic
and
fundamental.
but
i
think
when
you
consider
it
briefly,
you'll
understand
why,
i
understand
why
and
that's
because
the
states
and
the
government,
prosecutions
for
the
state
and
the
united
states
government
recognize
that
this
is
a
very
basic
and
fundamental
right.
consequently
there
are
very
few
times
in
which
the
occasion
arises
that
an
accused
will
not
be
confronted
at
trial
by
the
face-to-face
by
the
witnesses
against
him.
we
have
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes
sir.
that's
my
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
at
trial.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
you
mean
at
trial?
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes
certainly,
he
could
cross-examine
there.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes,
i
think
preliminary
hearing
and
trial
are
two
different
things.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
certainly
not.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
suggest
that
it
did.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
in
oklahoma
at
least,
under
the
decisions
of
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
this
area
where
they
have
held
before
in
similar
cases
that
where
witnesses
aren't
available
at
the
trial
and
he
has
been
available
at
preliminary
hearing
where
the
counsel
has
had
a
full
and
adequate
opportunity
to
cross-examine
and
he
is
unavailable
at
trial,
then
the
transcript
is
admissible.
i
think
a
counsel
in
oklahoma
goes
into
preliminary
hearing.
he
is
presumed
to
know
the
rules
of
the
--
the
rulings
of
this
court
of
criminal
appeals.
i
think
he
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
i
think
he
is--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
he
is
presumed
to
take
the
calculated
risk
of
either
cross-examining
him
or
risking
the
possibility
that
this
witness
might
die
or
for
some
other
reason
be
unavailable
at
trial.
i
think
he
on
the
one
hand
from
my
experience
on
both
sides
of
the
counsel
table,
on
the
one
hand,
he,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
said,
suggested,
that
it
may
not
wish
to
show
his
hand
at
preliminary
hearing
and
he
could
easily
show
his
hand
to
his
questions
on
cross-examination.
he
could
indicate
what
his
defense
later
would
be
at
trial.
many
defense
counsel
do
not
wish
to
ask
any
questions
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
i
agree
with
this.
on
the
other
hand,
he
takes
the
calculated
risk
in
oklahoma.
he
has
it
up
to
this
point
that
perhaps
this
witness
would
not
be
available.
he
has
got
to
choose
or
decide
at
that
point
whether
he
will
cross-examine
or
simply
remain
silent.
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes,
certainly.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
really
don't
know
for
sure,
your
honor.
the
record,
there
is
a
little
blank
in
there
as
you've
probably
seen.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
he
was
--
apparently,
an
agreement
was
reached
between
the
prosecution
that
he
would
not
be
prosecuted
in
the
state
court
in
return
for
his
testimony.
he
was
prosecuted
later
in
the
federal
court
for
some
other
crime.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
the
record
again
is
silent
there.
i
simply
don't
know.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no
sir.
there
is
none.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
have
set
out
the
date
i
believe
in
my
brief
between
the
preliminary
examination
and
the
time
that
the
defendant,
petitioner
here
came
on
for
trial.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
don't
believe
we
have
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
exact
date.
i
could
be
in
error
but
i
don't
recall
this.
i'm
sure
i
did
not
set
it
out
in
my
brief.
i
didn't
find
it
there.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
you
mean
the
length
of
time
after
the
preliminary
hearing
that
they
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
it
could
be.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
believe
not
sir.
first
of
all
--
as
i
read
the
counsel's
brief
and
as
i
listened
to
his
argument
today,
i
think
he
suggested
four
basic
points.
i
think
first
of
all,
he
suggests
that
the
case
of
pointer
versus
texas
should
be
strictly
construed,
i
think
in
favor
of
the
accused.
i
think
he
suggests
that
an
accused
is
entitled
to
be
confronted
by
his
witnesses
face-to-face
at
trial
and
that
is
where
we
part
ways.
i
think
to
use
--
to
make
that
interpretation
of
pointer
would
be
to
make
meaningless
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black
who
spoke
for
this
court
in
pointer.
mr.
justice
black
said
this
and
i
quote
from
the
pointer
case,
“the
case
before
us
would
be
quite
different.
it
would
be
a
quite
different
one
had
phillips
statement
and
then
taken
out
of
full
pledged
hearing
at
which
petitioner
had
been
represented
by
counsel
who
had
been
given
a
complete
and
adequate
opportunity
to
cross-examine.”
i
fail
to
see
how
we
can
interpret
pointer
to
mean
that
this
witness
must
appear
later
in
trial.
otherwise,
this
language
would
be
meaningless.
the
complete
and
adequate
opportunity
to
cross-examine
i
think
is
all
that
pointer
requires,
that's
our
case.
this
was
a
full
and
complete
preliminary
hearing.
in
fact,
this
witness
woods
was,
the
record
shows,
cross-examined
by
counsel
representing
one
of
the
other
co-defendants.
parks
said,
the
opportunity
to
do
this
and
as
i
mentioned,
suggested
a
minute
ago,
for
some
reason,
he
did
not.
i'm
not
sure
whether
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
ti
probably
is
about
50/50,
your
honor
from
experience
and
from
my
practice,
i
think
i'd
exercise
the
right
about
50%
of
the
time.
it
depends
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
i
think
if
this
can
be
shown
this
is
the
exception.
the
prosecution
cannot
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
certainly,
the
prosecution
i
suggest
could
not
do
anything
to
intentionally
make
the
witness
unavailable.
he
must
be
accidentally
unavailable
or
unfortunately
unavailable.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i'm
not
sure
mr.
chief
justice
that
they
released
him
to
the
federal
government.
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
simply
--
if
this
is
a
typical
case,
it
would
be
one
in
which
the
prosecution
made
an
agreement
with
him
that
he
would
testify
for
the
state
in
return
for
which
they
would
not
prosecute
him
or
would
work
out
some
recommended
sentence.
in
this
case,
evidently
in
return
for
the
promise
not
to
prosecute
at
that
stage,
they
would
release
him
until
trial
and
i
think
probably
this
is
what
happened
here.
they
released
him
and
in
the
meantime,
he
was
wanted
by
the
federal
officials
for
violations
of
some
federal
law.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
so.
again,
i
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no,
i
think
simply
releasing
him
is
not
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
as
i
was
going
to
point
out
in
my
concluding
remarks,
i
think
perhaps
to
be
quite
candid
with
the
court,
the
state's
most
difficult
part
of
defending
this
is
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
there
was
probably
no
effort
made
to
secure
the
release
from
the
federal
penitentiary.
i
don't
know
why.
i
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
perhaps
the
prosecutor
looked
at
--
looked
to
the
procedure,
looked
to
the
federal
statutes
and
it's
not
there.
at
least
i've
not
been
able
to
find
it.
there
are
certain
statutes
that
deal
with
the
transfer
of
federal
prisoners
and
so
forth
which
to
my
way
of
thinking
indicates
that
the
inclusion
of
one
excludes
all
others.
i've
forgotten
the
latin
phrase
for
that,
but
there
is
a
procedure
where
the
attorney
general
due
to
his
directive
presence
may
release
a
federal
prisoner
to
any
institution,
including
a
state
institution
and
they
very
often
do
this.
they
release
federal
prisoners
to
serve
out
certain
portions
of
state
sentences
or
to
be
prosecuted
in
the
state
courts.
but
i
have
not
run
across
a
statute
or
a
case
in
point
where
they
have
released
federal
prisoners
to
--
for
the
purpose
of
testifying
against
another
in
the
state
proceeding.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
don't
think
you
can
gather
that
from
the
record
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
we
must
assume
that
they
had
best
intentions
of
calling
him
at
trial,
but
in
the
meantime,
he
was
arrested
by
federal
officials
and
convicted
and
sent
to
prison,
federal
prison.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
or
should
--
i
don't
think
the
court
should
indulge
in
the
conjecture
that
the
state
intended
to
--
that
he
would
not
be
there
at
trial.
i
think
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
perhaps
i'm
basing
my
answer
on
personal
experience,
but
this
is
often
done
in
oklahoma
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes
and
i
think
this
is
usually
one
of
the
concessions.
he
--
this
man
is
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
jail.
in
oklahoma,
let
me
point
out,
robbery
with
firearms
which
this
was
is
a
capital
offense,
no
matter
if
any
one's
killed.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes.
a
bail
may
be
denied,
often
is.
it's
punishable
by
death
in
the
electric
chair.
this
is
what
he
was
charged
with.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
and
very
often,
one
of
the
concessions
made
by
the
state
is
the
agreement
that
we
will
let
you
out
pending
the
trial.
you'll
be
free
and
we'll
call
you
when
this
case
is
set
out
for
trial
and
you'll
testify
then.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
it's
not
a
practice,
no.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no,
i
mean
it's
a
practice
when
one
of
these
arrangements
is
worked
out
between
an
accused
and
the
state,
one
of
the
concessions
that
the
state
usually
makes
is
to
release
him
pending
trial.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
in
return
for
his
testimony.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
agree
with
this.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
as
far
as
the
state
knew
at
the
time
they
did
retain
possession.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
it
simply
is
not.
we
just
have
to
reason
i
think
in
the
case
like
this,
i
don't
think
we
should
presume
that
the
state
did
wrong.
i
think
we
should
presume
and
make
the
other
presumption.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
from
my
experience,
it's
been
very
hard.
i
--
maybe
impossible
to
get
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
well,
i've
never
been
on
the
prosecution
side
at
trial.
i've
been
on
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
well,
i've
been
on
the
defense
side
at
the
trial.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i've
never
been
a
prosecutor
in
a
trial.
i've
read
many
records
and
i
draw
on
that.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
don't
know.
likely,
i
think
probably
the
reasonable
thing
to
assume
is
that
this
prosecutor
knew
that
he
could
not
get
him
out
of
the
federal
penitentiary.
probably
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
suggest
that
he'd
probably
would
not
have
that.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
as
i
said
a
minute
ago,
i
have
looked
at
the
statutes
and
i'm
not
able
to
find
one
there.
there
is
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
no.
the
case
is
under
this
one
section
of
title
xvii
that
i've
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
they
are
all
cases
where
the
federal
authorities
release
federal
prisoners
from
the
federal
penitentiaries
to
a
state
to
serve
a
portion
of
the
some
unexpired
state
sentence,
that
kind
of
thing
in
the
prisoner
complains
that
you
can't
do
that
to
me
and
the
case
is
on
hold
that
this
is
a
matter
of
comity
and
you
can't
complain
about
where
you
serve
your
sentence.
but
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
testificandum?
i
think
so
but
i've
not
seen
one
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
it
means
to
bring
the
person
before
the
court
to
testify.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
but
it's
from
my
review
of
the
decisions
on
this
point,
it
merely
to
bring
a
prisoner
from
a
federal
penitentiary
or
somewhere
to
testify
before
this
federal
court
who
wants
--
before
whom
the
writ
is
pending.
not
to
bring
him
before
that
court
to
send
him
to
a
state
court,
i
have
not
found
a
case
like
that.
apparently,
the
counsel
has
not
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
to
testify
in
a
federal
prosecution?
mr.
charles
l.
owens
yes.
i
think
a
federal
court
could
and
has
i
think
in
the
case
that
counsel
points
out,
a
california
or
new
york
court
sends
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
to
new
york
court
or
vice
versa
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
owens
perhaps
it
might
have
to.
i
haven't
seen
a
case.
the
cases
i've
seen
were
from
--
were
the
ones
in
which
a
federal
court
in
aid
of
its
own
jurisdiction
obtained
a
witness
to
testify
before
it
and
not
to
testify
before
some
other
court,
perhaps
he
could.
i
don't
know
but
i
don't
find
a
case
like
this
and
i
searched
diligently
for
one.
mr.
charles
l.
owens
that
is
my
point,
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
second
contention
of
counsel
as
i
read
his
brief
and
as
i
listened
to
his
argument
and
that
is
that
counsel
cannot
waive
his
right
of
confrontation
for
his
client.
and
i
suggest
in
our
brief
that
this
is
not
like
some
rights
that
counsel
cannot
waive.
this
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
tactical
decision
on
the
part
of
the
counsel
as
the
manager
of
his
client's
lawsuit.
i
think
the
very
reason
that
an
accused
must
have
counsel
is
the
reason
that
he
must
exercise
certain
decisions
as
this,
whether
to
cross-examine
a
witness
or
things
in
that
nature
are
purely
tactical.
as
i
suggested
before,
his
strategy
in
this
particular
case
maybe
to
not
cross-examine
because
he
does
not
want
to
show
his
hand
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings.
i
don't
think
the
defendant
can
later
complain
that
he
didn't
personally
authorize
his
attorney
to
waive
the
right
of
confrontation.
to
indulge
in
this
reasoning
would
be
to
make
any
criminal
prosecution
endless.
there
will
always
be
a
question
of,
if
counsel
have
done
this
or
have
not
done
this
at
trial,
perhaps,
that
would
have
been
a
different
result,
but
this
is
not
the
test
of
effective
counsel
which
the
counsel
also
raises
here.
the
test
is
not
whether
by
hindsight,
we
can
examine
the
record
and
conclude
that
a
different
procedure
might
have
resulted
and
brought
about
a
different
result,
a
more
favorable
result.
again,
i
think
the
very
reason
that
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
to
represent
him
at
every
stage
of
the
criminal
process
is
the
reason
that
the
same
counsel
must
be
given
the
right
to
make
certain
waivers
or
to
exercise
his
discretion
as
to
tactics.
i
would
suggest
in
conclusion
that
this
court
has
stated
on
occasion
that
certainly,
rights
such
as
the
right
of
confrontation
of
witnesses
is
a
basic
right,
but
you
have
also
stated
and
i'd
like
to
quote
a
certain
language
from
the
case
of
mattox
versus
united
states
which
is
the
case
that
is
cited
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
pointer
case
in
which
he
said
that
general
rules
of
law
of
this
kind
are
ever
beneficent
in
their
operation
and
valuable
to
the
accused
must
occasionally
give
way
to
considerations
of
public
policy
and
the
necessities
of
the
case.
the
law
in
its
wisdom
declares
that
the
rights
of
the
public
shall
not
be
wholly
sacrificed
in
order
that
an
incidental
benefit
maybe
preserved
to
the
accused.
i
suggest
that
this
was
one
of
those
cases
where
the
petitioner
was
denied
face-to-face
confrontation
at
the
trial,
but
he
had
been
once
given
confrontation
at
a
preliminary
hearing
where
he
had
been
represented
by
the
counsel
who
had
been
afforded
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
i
think
this
is
all
that
the
pointer
requires
and
i
think
pointer
should
be
limited
to
its
particular
facts.
if
there
are
no
questions,
that's
all
my
presentation.
thank
you.
