mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
owens.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
you
say
unavailable
mr.
owens,
i
suppose
you
mean
unavailable
without
fault
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
the
sequence
of
events
that
were
here?
what
happened
to
mr.
woods
in
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
convicted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
state
--
did
the
state
inform
this
petitioner
that
it
had
made
that
agreement
and
was
going
to
consent
to
taking
him
out
of
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
did
do
that,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
he
go
to
texas?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
one
was
august
and
one
was
march
of
the
next
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
when
between
there
did
they
relinquish
him
to
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
think
that
that
might
be
important?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
available
to
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask,
how
often
in
practice
do
lawyers
examine
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
at
preliminary
examinations?
is
it
the
customary
thing
for
them
to
cross-examine
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
wondering
if
we
decided
with
you,
would
that
mean
that
in
every
case
where
there
was
some
cross-examination
that
the
prosecution
would
say
to
the
witness,
you're
free
to
go
any
place
you
want
and
if
you're
not
available
at
the
time
of
trial,
we
will
read
your
testimony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
this
be
the
exception
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
here
didn't
they
do
something
to
make
him
unavailable?
he
was
the
defendant
--
he
was
a
defendant
in
this
case.
they
used
him
at
the
preliminary
examination
evidently
with
the
intention
of
using
his
testimony
at
the
trial.
they
had
control
of
him
as
a
defendant
and
then
some
time
between
that
time
and
the
time
of
the
trial,
they
released
him
to
the
federal
government
to
try
him
over
in
another
place
where
they
could
just
as
well
have
held
in
there
to
give
his
testimony
in
the
court
and
thus
--
and
they
thus
made
him
unavailable
to
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
would
he
get
over
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
crime
that
he'd
committed
before
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
giving
him
away
to
another
jurisdiction
so
as
to
make
him
unavailable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
another
added
factor
to
the
one
that
justice
harlan
raised
in
that
the
state
knew
that
this
man
had
himself
committed
this
crime
because
he
confessed
and
implicated
this
petitioner,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
when
they
released
him,
they
knew
that
they
were
going
to
use
his
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
not?
they
put
him
on
the
preliminary
and
they
used
his
testimony
at
the
trial
in
absence
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
seems
to
me
rather
strange
and
not
in
keeping
with
the
practice
of
courts
for
them
to
just
take
his
testimony
at
the
preliminary
examination
and
then
release
him
without
the
intention
of
using
his
testimony
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
is
--
that
isn't
the
normal
practice,
is
it
of
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
capital
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
capital
case,
is
that
practice
in
existence
in
oklahoma
where
it's
clear
that
the
man
himself
committed
the
crime.
is
it
the
practice
to
bail
him
in
in
the
capital
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
well,
i
thought
you
said
it
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
did
they
make
that
--
why
did
they
make
that
concession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
then
they
did
intend
to
use
his
testimony
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
and
then
why
didn't
they
retain
possession
over
him
until
the
trial
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
instead
of
hand
him
over
to
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
there
a
proceeding
for
doing
that,
a
legal
proceeding
for
getting
him
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
able
to
find
that
a
federal
prisoner
can
be
taken
to
a
state
as
a
witness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
there
such
thing
as
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
that
mean?
what
kind
of
a
writ
is
that
and
what's
it
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
and
that's
in
the
federal
code,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rothgerber.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
