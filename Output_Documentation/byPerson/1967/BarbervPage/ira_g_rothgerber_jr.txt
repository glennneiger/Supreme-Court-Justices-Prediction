mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
writ
reviews
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
affirming
denial
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
petitioner
who
is
a
prisoner
in
the
oklahoma
penitentiary.
it
presents
the
court
a
difference
in
attitudes
if
not
an
actual
conflict
between
the
circuits.
the
petitioner
and
three
others
were
charged
by
information
with
robbery
with
firearms.
the
date
of
the
information
is
august
25,
1961,
which
was
three
days
following
a
preliminary
hearing
to
which
i
will
presently
refer.
as
a
result
of
the
information
a
good
many
months
later,
the
petitioner
was
tried
separately
from
his
co-defendants
and
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
of
a
co-defendant,
woods,
given
at
a
joint
preliminary
hearing
which
was
held
august
22,
1961,
three
days
before
the
information
was
read
to
the
jury
over
the
objection
of
woods’
--
of
petitioner's
counsel.
oklahoma
has
conceded
in
its
brief
that
prior
to
the
preliminary
hearing,
there
was
“apparently”
an
agreement
between
the
prosecution
and
woods,
the
co-defendant,
and
as
a
result
of
that
apparent
agreement,
woods
was
called
by
the
prosecution
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
gave
testimony
inculpating
the
petitioner.
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
both
petitioner
and
woods
were
represented
by
one
retained
attorney,
a
gentleman
named
mr.
parks.
woods
was
called
to
the
stand.
he
was
admonished
by
his
attorney
that
he
need
not
to
give
evidence.
there
was
a
recess
in
the
proceedings.
after
the
recess,
mr.
woods
came
back,
mr.
parks
came
back,
withdrew
as
counsel
for
woods
and
there
upon,
woods
gave
his
testimony
which
was
significant
in
the
conviction
of
petitioner.
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
mr.
parks
did
not
cross-examine
petitioner
but
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
petitioner
was
cross-examined
by
an
attorney
for
another
of
those
at
that
time
jointly
accused.
i
will
now
relate
a
fact
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
opening
brief
and
which
was
not
before
the
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
but
a
fact
which
we
ask
this
court
to
notice
in
its
supervisory
capacity
over
united
states
courts.
on
september
7,
1961,
september
14,
1961,
october
5,
1961
and
october
6,
1961,
mr.
parks
whom
you
will
remember
had
withdrawn
his
appearance
on
behalf
of
woods
in
the
state
court
preliminary
hearing
appeared
as
mr.
woods'
counsel
in
proceedings
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
oklahoma,
and
on
the
last
date
mentioned,
october
6,
1961,
a
sentence
was
imposed
on
mr.
woods.
he
was
there
upon
taken
to
the
penitentiary
in
texarkana,
texas.
and
on
march
5,
1962
several
months
later,
petitioner's
trial
commenced
in
the
district
court
in
tulsa,
oklahoma,
mr.
parks
was
then
representing
the
petitioner.
the
state
offered
a
transcript
of
woods'
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
parks
objected.
mr.
parks
in
support
of
this
objection
made
an
offer
of
proof
in
which
he
stated
that
in
fact,
mr.
woods
was
confined
in
the
state
penitentiary
--
in
federal
penitentiary
at
texarkana,
texas
which
is
200
and
300
miles
from
tulsa.
the
objection
was
overruled.
the
transcript
was
read
to
the
jury
which
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty.
the
petitioner
appealed
to
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
which
affirmed.
he
then
sought
habeas
corpus
and
after
an
intermediate
step
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
satisfied,
he
had
exhausted
his
state
remedies,
it
was
determined
that
he
had.
the
court
of
appeals
however
has
stated
that
there
is
no
denial
of
the
right
of
confrontation
in
this
case.
this
is
the
principal
issue
here,
was
the
petitioner
denied
his
right
of
confrontation.
oklahoma
asserts
and
this
poses
another
important
issue
that
by
his
inaction
in
failing
to
examine
woods
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
mr.
parks
on
behalf
of
petitioner
effectively
waived
the
right
of
confrontation.
finally,
we
have
what
is
probably
a
peripheral
issue
that
naturally
flows
from
this
sequence
of
events
and
that
is
whether
or
not
mr.
parks
effectively
represented
the
petitioner
in
his
trial.
judge
aldrich
who
is
sitting
with
the
tenth
circuit
by
special
designation
dissented
from
the
opinion.
oklahoma's
argument
which
i'm
sure
you
will
hear
presently
is
that
mr.
parks'
failure
to
cross-examine
woods
at
the
preliminary
hearing
was
a
tactical
decision
and
oklahoma
uses
these
words
to
characterize
it.
it
was
a
“decision
to
be
ineffective”.
oklahoma
urges
that
a
decision
to
be
ineffective
is
binding
on
the
petitioner
as
a
waiver
of
the
right
of
confrontation.
in
pointer
against
texas,
the
court
coupled
the
right
to
confrontation
with
the
right
to
cross-examination
saying
that
they
are
essential
and
fundamental
requirements
for
the
kind
of
fair
trial
which
is
country's
constitutional
goal.
in
pointer
against
texas,
mr.
pointer
had
no
counsel.
the
petitioner's
counsel
at
no
time
either
at
the
preliminary
hearing
or
any
other
time,
cross-examined
the
co-defendant,
of
course
he
couldn't
because
the
co-defendant
was
not
at
the
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
state
to
go
to
a
federal
court
and
seek
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
which
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
as
a
quasi
writ
and
have
it
denied
prior
to
introducing
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
while
not
using
the
word
waiver,
it
characterized
mr.
parks'
inaction,
his
failure
to
cross-examine
woods
at
the
preliminary
hearing
as
though
it
were
wavered.
in
pointer
against
texas,
the
court
said
that
nothing
in
the
case
was
contrary
to
the
old
case
of
mattox
against
the
united
states.
in
mattox,
the
transcript
which
was
read
had
been
the
subject
of
thorough
and
grilling
cross-examination
at
the
first
trial
of
mattox.
we
come
then
to
the
difference
in
attitude,
what
is
the
burden
to
be
cast
on
the
prosecution,
whether
it
is
a
state
court
or
a
federal
prosecution,
in
bringing
forth
a
witness
who
is
easily
attainable.
oklahoma
has
said
in
its
brief
that
they
were
not
referred
to
any
statute
or
any
case
law
which
indicated
that
the
state
had
any
burden
or
that
it
even
was
possible
for
the
states
to
produce
a
federal
prisoner.
we
have,
in
our
reply
brief,
referred
the
court
to
the
statute
which
provides
for
federal
writs
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum.
we
did
not
in
either
brief
called
the
court's
attention
ponzi
against
fessenden,
258
us
254
in
which
the
court
recognized
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
has
the
power,
the
authority
to
exercise
the
comity
which
is
inherent
in
two
competing
legal
systems
which
compete
in
the
same
jurisdiction.
the
square
collision,
if
it
is
that,
between
the
circuits
is
best
found
in
a
decision
of
the
third
circuit,
government
of
the
virgin
islands
versus
aquino
which
held
that
as
a
predicate
to
introduction
of
the
testimony
of
the
absent
witness
unavailable,
they
must
be
shown
both
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirement
of
confrontation
and
the
evidentiary
requirement
of
confrontation.
in
virgin
islands
against
aquino,
there
was
a
rape
prosecution.
the
prosecutrix
was
a
stewardess
on
a
norwegian
ship
as
i
recall
it
and
at
the
trial,
her
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing
was
offered.
it
was
submitted
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
third
circuit
reversed
and
laid
down
this
test
which
i
submit
is
contrary
to
the
casual
test
[inaudible]
indeed
and
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
tenth
circuit.
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit
said.
“the
reasonableness
of
efforts
to
secure
attendance
in
the
virgin
islands
of
a
witness
whether
he
is
in
another
state
of
the
union
or
in
a
foreign
country
must
be
judged
of
the
standards
of
modern
air
travel
and
not
of
the
sailing
vessel
or
even
the
steam
ship
where
the
liberty
of
the
defendant
is
at
stake,
the
government
which
prosecutes
him
may
not
secure
the
benefit
of
incriminating
testimony
against
him
unless
it
shows
its
genuine
and
bona
fide
effort
to
secure
the
attendance
of
the
witness.
an
effort
which
expires
of
the
shoreline
of
virgin
islands
cannot
be
said
to
have
inherently
in
it.
the
proof
of
its
genuineness
and
its
bona
fide
character.
no
effort
can
be
deemed
genuine
and
bona
fide
which
is
not
reasonable
in
its
extent
and
reasonableness
must
be
judged
not
by
artificial
boundaries,
but
by
limitations
of
time
and
distance.”
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
virgin
islands
against
aquino
your
honor
is
378
f.2nd
540.
it's
a
1967
case
and
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
the
fifth
circuit
also
has
differed
from
the
tenth
circuit's
casual
test
in
holman
against
washington
which
is
also
referred
to
in
our
brief,
it
is
cited
364
f.2nd
618,
where
the
court
took
note
that
compulsory
process
is
not
the
only
method
of
securing
attendance
of
witnesses
and
said
that
the
right
of
confrontation
is
too
valuable
right
to
be
sacrificed
for
the
convenience
of
a
party.
oklahoma
has
replied
relying
principally
on
the
ninth
circuit
case
of
wilson
against
gray,
345
f.2nd
287
that
the
lawyer
is
the
manager
of
the
case.
he
makes
the
tactical
determination.
the
tactical
determination
is
binding
upon
his
client.
parks'
conduct
in
his
representation
of
petitioner
so
taints
that
representation
that
it
is
doubtful
that
under
the
standards
of
brookhart
against
janis,
he
effectively
could
waive
the
petitioner's
right
of
confrontation.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
no
your
honor.
i
do
not
concede
that.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
proper
concession
to
make
in
the
light
of
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
concerning
confrontation.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
there
are
two
mattox.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
indeed
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
makes
this
very
distinction
in
government
of
virgin
islands
against
aquino
because
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
particularly
here
where
the
preliminary
hearing
preceded
the
date
of
information
by
three
days
so
that
the
counsel
even
assuming
that
he
were
counsel
only
for
the
petitioner,
he
doesn't
know
the
charges
that
are
pending
against
his
petitioner
and
all
of
us
who
are
lawyers
know
that
at
a
preliminary
hearing
of
the
standard
is
only
one
of
showing
probable
cause
and
it
isn't
very
prudent
representation
of
one's
client
to
enlarge
upon
the
prosecution
state
--
prosecution's
case
which
is
always
a
possibility.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor
--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
that
is
quite
correct
your
honor.
as
your
honor
will
recall,
i
said
that
the
lawyer's
lack
of
faith
if
we
can
call
it
that,
really
is
a
peripheral
issue.
it
is
peripheral
in
the
sense
that
any
lawyer,
who
has
this
divided
loyalty,
effectively
waives
the
right
of
confrontation.
oklahoma
urges
that
this
was
a
waiver
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
while
not
characterizing
it
with
the
word
waiver
in
substance
held
that
it
was
and
that
is
the
only
reason
that
i
have
mentioned
in
--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
for
information.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
well
of
course,
if
the
court
reaches
that
conclusion
then
there
is
no
necessity
for
reaching
the
other
points.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
but
it
certainly
as
your
honor
said,
it
is
certainly
arguable
and
it's
been
argued
by
the
authorities
including
dean
wigmor
that
the
right
of
confrontation
is
a
bifurcated
right
with
bifurcated
advantages
to
the
defendant.
the
first
being
the
advantage
of
inquiry,
the
second
being
the
advantage
of
having
the
jury
observe
demeanor.
well,
of
course
assuming
that
mattox
is
still
a
good
law,
one
jury
at
least
did
observe
the
demeanor
with
cross-examination
of
trial.
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
there
is
no
trier
of
the
facts
to
observe
demeanor
and
in
the
government
of
virgin
islands
against
aquino,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
draws
this
distinction
very
vividly.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
yes
it
would
your
honor.
indeed,
it
would
because
as
i
hope
--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
yes,
yes
because
i
think
that's
all
they
did,
if
they
did
that.
but
if
mr.
barber
did
it,
certainly,
his
attorney
just
didn't
cross-examine.
now,
one
of
the
very
things
that
an
experienced
lawyer
would
do
at
preliminary
hearing--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
quite
correct
your
honor.
the
question
is
not
what
the
lawyer
did,
it's
really
what
the
client
understood
was
being
done
and
--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
of
course,
the
position
which
would
be
best
from
the
standpoint
of
petitioner
here
and
which
would
have
the
best
result
for
him
would
be
if
the
court
were
to
say
that
under
no
circumstances
is
the
transcript
of
testimony
at
a
preliminary
hearing
admissible
at
trial.
now
that
is
the
very
best
result
we
could
expect
to
achieve.
there
are
some
secondary
results
however
which
might
be
achieved
and
might
flow
because
of
the
waiver
question
which
is
so
strongly
urged
by
oklahoma
in
its
answer
brief.
the
essence
of
course
is,
what
is
the
requirement
upon
a
state
to
introduce
any
former
testimony.
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
fortas,
perhaps
the
rule
can
be
if
there
were
a
former
full
pledged
trial
and
in
pointer
against
texas,
the
court
talked
about
a
full
pledged
hearing
and
i
think
the
only
reason
that
we
tend
to
dwell
on
the
nature
of
the
preliminary
hearing
is
that
that's
just
what
the
problem
was
in
pointer
against
texas.
that
was
a
preliminary
hearing
case.
but
if
the
court
were
to
say
no
testimony
of
a
preliminary
hearing
--
at
a
preliminary
hearing
may
ever
be
introduced
then
of
course
we
have
an
ideal
result
from
mr.
barber's
point
of
view.
in
douglas
against
alabama
which
was
decided
the
same
day
as
pointer
against
texas,
the
court
talked
about
waiver
in
that
case
also
and
restricted
its
discussion
there
to
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
this
is
a
third
possible
result
for
petitioner
here
and
its
one
of
the
reasons
as
i
talked,
as
i
did
about
his
counsel's
conduct
and
that
is
to
restrict
the
decision
here
to
the
circumstance
of
this
case
and
say
that
in
all
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
there
was
not
an
untainted
waiver
of
petitioner's
right
of
confrontation.
unless
there
are
questions
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice
inquired
as
to
the
chronology
of
events
concerning
the
turnover
of
mr.
woods
to
the
federal
government.
the
chronology
appears
very
clearly
in
appendix
a
to
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
form
of
a
letter
from
the
clerk
reciting
what
happened,
including
the
date
on
october
6,
1961
when
he
was
sentenced.
oklahoma
itself
has
foreseen
the
danger
of
the
interplay
between
prosecution
authorities
and
one
defendant
with
the
resultant
danger
that
somebody
might
be
sent
away
and
made
unavailable.
the
case
is
caide
(ph)
against
state,
83
f.2nd
605
from
which
we
quote
at
page
16
of
our
opening
brief.
oklahoma
recognized
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
diligence
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
isn't
the
narrow
question
here,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
court
does
not
rule
that
at
no
time
can
transcript
of
a
preliminary
hearing
be
introduced,
then
the
next
question
becomes
as
suggested,
what
is
the
degree
of
diligence
required
of
the
prosecution?
in
summary,
i
suggest
the
rule
of
diligence
is
not
the
casual
rule
about
the
tenth
circuit
but
at
least
some
diligence
as
commanded
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
government
of
virgin
islands
against
aquino.
thank
you.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
writ
reviews
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
affirming
denial
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
petitioner
who
is
a
prisoner
in
the
oklahoma
penitentiary.
it
presents
the
court
a
difference
in
attitudes
if
not
an
actual
conflict
between
the
circuits.
the
petitioner
and
three
others
were
charged
by
information
with
robbery
with
firearms.
the
date
of
the
information
is
august
25,
1961,
which
was
three
days
following
a
preliminary
hearing
to
which
i
will
presently
refer.
as
a
result
of
the
information
a
good
many
months
later,
the
petitioner
was
tried
separately
from
his
co-defendants
and
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
of
a
co-defendant,
woods,
given
at
a
joint
preliminary
hearing
which
was
held
august
22,
1961,
three
days
before
the
information
was
read
to
the
jury
over
the
objection
of
woods’
--
of
petitioner's
counsel.
oklahoma
has
conceded
in
its
brief
that
prior
to
the
preliminary
hearing,
there
was
“apparently”
an
agreement
between
the
prosecution
and
woods,
the
co-defendant,
and
as
a
result
of
that
apparent
agreement,
woods
was
called
by
the
prosecution
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
gave
testimony
inculpating
the
petitioner.
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
both
petitioner
and
woods
were
represented
by
one
retained
attorney,
a
gentleman
named
mr.
parks.
woods
was
called
to
the
stand.
he
was
admonished
by
his
attorney
that
he
need
not
to
give
evidence.
there
was
a
recess
in
the
proceedings.
after
the
recess,
mr.
woods
came
back,
mr.
parks
came
back,
withdrew
as
counsel
for
woods
and
there
upon,
woods
gave
his
testimony
which
was
significant
in
the
conviction
of
petitioner.
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
mr.
parks
did
not
cross-examine
petitioner
but
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
petitioner
was
cross-examined
by
an
attorney
for
another
of
those
at
that
time
jointly
accused.
i
will
now
relate
a
fact
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
opening
brief
and
which
was
not
before
the
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
but
a
fact
which
we
ask
this
court
to
notice
in
its
supervisory
capacity
over
united
states
courts.
on
september
7,
1961,
september
14,
1961,
october
5,
1961
and
october
6,
1961,
mr.
parks
whom
you
will
remember
had
withdrawn
his
appearance
on
behalf
of
woods
in
the
state
court
preliminary
hearing
appeared
as
mr.
woods'
counsel
in
proceedings
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
oklahoma,
and
on
the
last
date
mentioned,
october
6,
1961,
a
sentence
was
imposed
on
mr.
woods.
he
was
there
upon
taken
to
the
penitentiary
in
texarkana,
texas.
and
on
march
5,
1962
several
months
later,
petitioner's
trial
commenced
in
the
district
court
in
tulsa,
oklahoma,
mr.
parks
was
then
representing
the
petitioner.
the
state
offered
a
transcript
of
woods'
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
parks
objected.
mr.
parks
in
support
of
this
objection
made
an
offer
of
proof
in
which
he
stated
that
in
fact,
mr.
woods
was
confined
in
the
state
penitentiary
--
in
federal
penitentiary
at
texarkana,
texas
which
is
200
and
300
miles
from
tulsa.
the
objection
was
overruled.
the
transcript
was
read
to
the
jury
which
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty.
the
petitioner
appealed
to
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
which
affirmed.
he
then
sought
habeas
corpus
and
after
an
intermediate
step
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
satisfied,
he
had
exhausted
his
state
remedies,
it
was
determined
that
he
had.
the
court
of
appeals
however
has
stated
that
there
is
no
denial
of
the
right
of
confrontation
in
this
case.
this
is
the
principal
issue
here,
was
the
petitioner
denied
his
right
of
confrontation.
oklahoma
asserts
and
this
poses
another
important
issue
that
by
his
inaction
in
failing
to
examine
woods
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
mr.
parks
on
behalf
of
petitioner
effectively
waived
the
right
of
confrontation.
finally,
we
have
what
is
probably
a
peripheral
issue
that
naturally
flows
from
this
sequence
of
events
and
that
is
whether
or
not
mr.
parks
effectively
represented
the
petitioner
in
his
trial.
judge
aldrich
who
is
sitting
with
the
tenth
circuit
by
special
designation
dissented
from
the
opinion.
oklahoma's
argument
which
i'm
sure
you
will
hear
presently
is
that
mr.
parks'
failure
to
cross-examine
woods
at
the
preliminary
hearing
was
a
tactical
decision
and
oklahoma
uses
these
words
to
characterize
it.
it
was
a
“decision
to
be
ineffective”.
oklahoma
urges
that
a
decision
to
be
ineffective
is
binding
on
the
petitioner
as
a
waiver
of
the
right
of
confrontation.
in
pointer
against
texas,
the
court
coupled
the
right
to
confrontation
with
the
right
to
cross-examination
saying
that
they
are
essential
and
fundamental
requirements
for
the
kind
of
fair
trial
which
is
country's
constitutional
goal.
in
pointer
against
texas,
mr.
pointer
had
no
counsel.
the
petitioner's
counsel
at
no
time
either
at
the
preliminary
hearing
or
any
other
time,
cross-examined
the
co-defendant,
of
course
he
couldn't
because
the
co-defendant
was
not
at
the
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
state
to
go
to
a
federal
court
and
seek
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
which
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
as
a
quasi
writ
and
have
it
denied
prior
to
introducing
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
while
not
using
the
word
waiver,
it
characterized
mr.
parks'
inaction,
his
failure
to
cross-examine
woods
at
the
preliminary
hearing
as
though
it
were
wavered.
in
pointer
against
texas,
the
court
said
that
nothing
in
the
case
was
contrary
to
the
old
case
of
mattox
against
the
united
states.
in
mattox,
the
transcript
which
was
read
had
been
the
subject
of
thorough
and
grilling
cross-examination
at
the
first
trial
of
mattox.
we
come
then
to
the
difference
in
attitude,
what
is
the
burden
to
be
cast
on
the
prosecution,
whether
it
is
a
state
court
or
a
federal
prosecution,
in
bringing
forth
a
witness
who
is
easily
attainable.
oklahoma
has
said
in
its
brief
that
they
were
not
referred
to
any
statute
or
any
case
law
which
indicated
that
the
state
had
any
burden
or
that
it
even
was
possible
for
the
states
to
produce
a
federal
prisoner.
we
have,
in
our
reply
brief,
referred
the
court
to
the
statute
which
provides
for
federal
writs
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum.
we
did
not
in
either
brief
called
the
court's
attention
ponzi
against
fessenden,
258
us
254
in
which
the
court
recognized
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
has
the
power,
the
authority
to
exercise
the
comity
which
is
inherent
in
two
competing
legal
systems
which
compete
in
the
same
jurisdiction.
the
square
collision,
if
it
is
that,
between
the
circuits
is
best
found
in
a
decision
of
the
third
circuit,
government
of
the
virgin
islands
versus
aquino
which
held
that
as
a
predicate
to
introduction
of
the
testimony
of
the
absent
witness
unavailable,
they
must
be
shown
both
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirement
of
confrontation
and
the
evidentiary
requirement
of
confrontation.
in
virgin
islands
against
aquino,
there
was
a
rape
prosecution.
the
prosecutrix
was
a
stewardess
on
a
norwegian
ship
as
i
recall
it
and
at
the
trial,
her
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing
was
offered.
it
was
submitted
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
third
circuit
reversed
and
laid
down
this
test
which
i
submit
is
contrary
to
the
casual
test
[inaudible]
indeed
and
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
tenth
circuit.
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit
said.
“the
reasonableness
of
efforts
to
secure
attendance
in
the
virgin
islands
of
a
witness
whether
he
is
in
another
state
of
the
union
or
in
a
foreign
country
must
be
judged
of
the
standards
of
modern
air
travel
and
not
of
the
sailing
vessel
or
even
the
steam
ship
where
the
liberty
of
the
defendant
is
at
stake,
the
government
which
prosecutes
him
may
not
secure
the
benefit
of
incriminating
testimony
against
him
unless
it
shows
its
genuine
and
bona
fide
effort
to
secure
the
attendance
of
the
witness.
an
effort
which
expires
of
the
shoreline
of
virgin
islands
cannot
be
said
to
have
inherently
in
it.
the
proof
of
its
genuineness
and
its
bona
fide
character.
no
effort
can
be
deemed
genuine
and
bona
fide
which
is
not
reasonable
in
its
extent
and
reasonableness
must
be
judged
not
by
artificial
boundaries,
but
by
limitations
of
time
and
distance.”
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
virgin
islands
against
aquino
your
honor
is
378
f.2nd
540.
it's
a
1967
case
and
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
the
fifth
circuit
also
has
differed
from
the
tenth
circuit's
casual
test
in
holman
against
washington
which
is
also
referred
to
in
our
brief,
it
is
cited
364
f.2nd
618,
where
the
court
took
note
that
compulsory
process
is
not
the
only
method
of
securing
attendance
of
witnesses
and
said
that
the
right
of
confrontation
is
too
valuable
right
to
be
sacrificed
for
the
convenience
of
a
party.
oklahoma
has
replied
relying
principally
on
the
ninth
circuit
case
of
wilson
against
gray,
345
f.2nd
287
that
the
lawyer
is
the
manager
of
the
case.
he
makes
the
tactical
determination.
the
tactical
determination
is
binding
upon
his
client.
parks'
conduct
in
his
representation
of
petitioner
so
taints
that
representation
that
it
is
doubtful
that
under
the
standards
of
brookhart
against
janis,
he
effectively
could
waive
the
petitioner's
right
of
confrontation.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
no
your
honor.
i
do
not
concede
that.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
proper
concession
to
make
in
the
light
of
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
concerning
confrontation.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
there
are
two
mattox.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
indeed
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
makes
this
very
distinction
in
government
of
virgin
islands
against
aquino
because
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
particularly
here
where
the
preliminary
hearing
preceded
the
date
of
information
by
three
days
so
that
the
counsel
even
assuming
that
he
were
counsel
only
for
the
petitioner,
he
doesn't
know
the
charges
that
are
pending
against
his
petitioner
and
all
of
us
who
are
lawyers
know
that
at
a
preliminary
hearing
of
the
standard
is
only
one
of
showing
probable
cause
and
it
isn't
very
prudent
representation
of
one's
client
to
enlarge
upon
the
prosecution
state
--
prosecution's
case
which
is
always
a
possibility.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor
--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
that
is
quite
correct
your
honor.
as
your
honor
will
recall,
i
said
that
the
lawyer's
lack
of
faith
if
we
can
call
it
that,
really
is
a
peripheral
issue.
it
is
peripheral
in
the
sense
that
any
lawyer,
who
has
this
divided
loyalty,
effectively
waives
the
right
of
confrontation.
oklahoma
urges
that
this
was
a
waiver
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
while
not
characterizing
it
with
the
word
waiver
in
substance
held
that
it
was
and
that
is
the
only
reason
that
i
have
mentioned
in
--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
for
information.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
well
of
course,
if
the
court
reaches
that
conclusion
then
there
is
no
necessity
for
reaching
the
other
points.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
but
it
certainly
as
your
honor
said,
it
is
certainly
arguable
and
it's
been
argued
by
the
authorities
including
dean
wigmor
that
the
right
of
confrontation
is
a
bifurcated
right
with
bifurcated
advantages
to
the
defendant.
the
first
being
the
advantage
of
inquiry,
the
second
being
the
advantage
of
having
the
jury
observe
demeanor.
well,
of
course
assuming
that
mattox
is
still
a
good
law,
one
jury
at
least
did
observe
the
demeanor
with
cross-examination
of
trial.
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
there
is
no
trier
of
the
facts
to
observe
demeanor
and
in
the
government
of
virgin
islands
against
aquino,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
draws
this
distinction
very
vividly.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
yes
it
would
your
honor.
indeed,
it
would
because
as
i
hope
--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
yes,
yes
because
i
think
that's
all
they
did,
if
they
did
that.
but
if
mr.
barber
did
it,
certainly,
his
attorney
just
didn't
cross-examine.
now,
one
of
the
very
things
that
an
experienced
lawyer
would
do
at
preliminary
hearing--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
quite
correct
your
honor.
the
question
is
not
what
the
lawyer
did,
it's
really
what
the
client
understood
was
being
done
and
--
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
of
course,
the
position
which
would
be
best
from
the
standpoint
of
petitioner
here
and
which
would
have
the
best
result
for
him
would
be
if
the
court
were
to
say
that
under
no
circumstances
is
the
transcript
of
testimony
at
a
preliminary
hearing
admissible
at
trial.
now
that
is
the
very
best
result
we
could
expect
to
achieve.
there
are
some
secondary
results
however
which
might
be
achieved
and
might
flow
because
of
the
waiver
question
which
is
so
strongly
urged
by
oklahoma
in
its
answer
brief.
the
essence
of
course
is,
what
is
the
requirement
upon
a
state
to
introduce
any
former
testimony.
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
fortas,
perhaps
the
rule
can
be
if
there
were
a
former
full
pledged
trial
and
in
pointer
against
texas,
the
court
talked
about
a
full
pledged
hearing
and
i
think
the
only
reason
that
we
tend
to
dwell
on
the
nature
of
the
preliminary
hearing
is
that
that's
just
what
the
problem
was
in
pointer
against
texas.
that
was
a
preliminary
hearing
case.
but
if
the
court
were
to
say
no
testimony
of
a
preliminary
hearing
--
at
a
preliminary
hearing
may
ever
be
introduced
then
of
course
we
have
an
ideal
result
from
mr.
barber's
point
of
view.
in
douglas
against
alabama
which
was
decided
the
same
day
as
pointer
against
texas,
the
court
talked
about
waiver
in
that
case
also
and
restricted
its
discussion
there
to
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
this
is
a
third
possible
result
for
petitioner
here
and
its
one
of
the
reasons
as
i
talked,
as
i
did
about
his
counsel's
conduct
and
that
is
to
restrict
the
decision
here
to
the
circumstance
of
this
case
and
say
that
in
all
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
there
was
not
an
untainted
waiver
of
petitioner's
right
of
confrontation.
unless
there
are
questions
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ira
g.
rothgerber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice
inquired
as
to
the
chronology
of
events
concerning
the
turnover
of
mr.
woods
to
the
federal
government.
the
chronology
appears
very
clearly
in
appendix
a
to
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
form
of
a
letter
from
the
clerk
reciting
what
happened,
including
the
date
on
october
6,
1961
when
he
was
sentenced.
oklahoma
itself
has
foreseen
the
danger
of
the
interplay
between
prosecution
authorities
and
one
defendant
with
the
resultant
danger
that
somebody
might
be
sent
away
and
made
unavailable.
the
case
is
caide
(ph)
against
state,
83
f.2nd
605
from
which
we
quote
at
page
16
of
our
opening
brief.
oklahoma
recognized
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
diligence
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
isn't
the
narrow
question
here,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
court
does
not
rule
that
at
no
time
can
transcript
of
a
preliminary
hearing
be
introduced,
then
the
next
question
becomes
as
suggested,
what
is
the
degree
of
diligence
required
of
the
prosecution?
in
summary,
i
suggest
the
rule
of
diligence
is
not
the
casual
rule
about
the
tenth
circuit
but
at
least
some
diligence
as
commanded
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
government
of
virgin
islands
against
aquino.
thank
you.
