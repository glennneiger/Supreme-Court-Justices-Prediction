--
they
only
purported
them
to
waive
cross-examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
my
point.
i
don't
see
why
it's
important
as
to
whether
or
not
the
lawyer
did
it
intelligently
or
stupidly
or
deliberately.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
also
--
it's
a
question
of
whether
--
whatever
it
could
have
any
relevance?
justice

[inaudible]
federal
court.
so
we
have
a
trial
of
a
federal
court
and
the
defendant
wants
to
get
the
testimony
or
the
prosecution
was
to
get
the
testimony
of
some
prisoner
who
is
in
a
state
prison
and
would
you
think
that
you
can
subpoena
that
witness
--
justice
byron
r.
white
hmm...
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
--
why
wouldn't
be
reverse
work?
why
would
you
suggest
that
reverse
couldn't
work
if
there
is
a
criminal
trial
in
the
state
court
and
even
the
defense
of
the
prosecution
was
to
get
to
the
testimony
of
a
witness
who
is
been
held
in
a
federal
prison
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
suggest
that
united
states
wouldn't
have
to
honor
some
descent
--
some
kind
of
a
proper
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
of
course,
if
the
state
couldn't
have
got
him
even
if
they
tried
in
fact
if
they
try
it
isn't
so
significant
–
that
they
didn't
tried
it
is
so
significant?
justice
byron
r.

--
they
only
