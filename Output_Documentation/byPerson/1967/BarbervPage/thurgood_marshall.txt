justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rothgerber,
assuming
that
both
the
barber
and
his
lawyer
intelligently
waived
in
such
language
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
wouldn't
your
argument
still
be
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
owens.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree
in
--
i
wonder
if
i'm
correct
on
this.
it's
your
position
that
he
waived
the
right
to
cross-examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
binding
on
him
throughout
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
that's
true,
suppose
you
had
produced
this
witness
and
he
testified
in
open
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
is
it
your
position
that
the
lawyer
could
cross-examine
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
couldn't
stop
him,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
he
didn't
waive,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
saying
he
waived,
he
waived
the
cross-examination
at
the
preliminary
trial
of
this
witness
and
you
produced
that
witness
at
the
trial
itself.
you
could
not
stop
him
from
examination.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
his
waiver
did
not
carry
over
to
the
trial
itself,
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
lost.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
ruling
includes
he
is
presumed
to
know
that
that
witness
won't
be
available?
justice
thurgood
marshall
rather
he'd
assume
he
will
be
available,
wouldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
owens,
assuming
that
parks
--
that
the
other
fellow
did
not
testify
in
the
preliminary
hearing
and
assuming
he
was
latter
to
pick
up
and
put
in
the
several
penitentiary
in
texarkana,
would
i
be
fair
in
assuming
that
under
those
circumstances,
you'd
find
some
way
to
get
him
back
to
testify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
in
your
experience,
did
you
make
an
effort
to
get
him
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
is
this
experience
you're
talking
about
where
you
say
it's
so
difficult
to
get
him
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
prosecution
side.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
you
assume
that
they
would
make
an
effort
to
get
in
the
case
i
gave
you?
and
to
be
fair
with,
if
you
answer
that
yes,
i
may
ask
why
it
wasn't
done
here?
