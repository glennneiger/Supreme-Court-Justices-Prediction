justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
conceding
that
if
there
had
been
vigorous
cross-examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
transcript
would
have
been
proper
--
pro
se
the
transcript
and
evidence
at
the
subsequent
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mattox
was
a
different
case.
that's
the
old
mattox
which
was
mattox
against
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
case
where
there
had
been
a
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
two
witnesses
died
and
there
was
later
a
retrial.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
that
it's
arguable
in
a
way
that
the
cross-examination
at
a
trial
is
one
thing,
cross-examination
at
a
preliminary
examination
is
quite
a
different
thing
and
that
they
are
not
substitutable
one
for
the
other
in
terms
of
the
due
process
standard?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
why
i
have
so
much
--
i
have
some
difficulty
in
understanding
why
you
make
such
a
point
of
mr.
--
this
lawyer's
alleged
lack
of
faithful
representation
of
his
client
because
even
if
he
were
the
most
deciduous
and
rigorous
lawyer
in
the
world,
it
might
very
well
be
that
at
a
preliminary
examination,
he
might
decide
to
withhold
across
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
not
be
prepared,
very
likely
would
not
be
prepared
for
a
cross-examination?
