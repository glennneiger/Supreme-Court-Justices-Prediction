mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
case
comes
here
by
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
seeking
reinstatement
of
an
indictment
which
was
brought
under
section
241
of
the
criminal
code.
that
section
which
as
your
honors
know
was
inspired
originally
by
the
activities
of
the
ku
klux
klan
and
it
dates
back
to
1870,
punishes
any
conspiracy
to
injure,
intimidate
or
oppress
a
citizen
because
of
his
exercise
of
any
right
or
privilege
secured
to
him
by
the
constitution
or
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
indictment
here
charged
that
the
four
appellees
had
conspired
to
injure
and
intimidate
three
negro
citizens
because
the
latter
had
exercised
their
rights
guaranteed
by
the
public
accommodations
title
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
to
patronize
a
roadside
restaurant.
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
concluded
that
the
provisions
for
injunctive
relief
which
appear
in
that
1964
act
constitute
the
exclusive
means
of
dealing
with
a
violation
of
the
public
accommodations
law,
and
that
those
provisions
preclude
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
it
accordingly
dismissed
the
indictment.
since
this
case
has
not
gone
to
trial,
the
facts
have
not
been
fully
developed.
i
think
it
suffices
to
say
that
the
basis
of
the
prosecution
is
that
the
appellees,
persons
wholly
unconnected
with
the
restaurant
or
truck
stop
where
this
incident
occurred
severely
attacked
and
beat
the
negro
travelers
in
question.
after
those
travelers
had
sought
and
obtained
service
and
were
returning
from
the
restaurant
to
their
parked
automobile.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it
would
cover
much
more
of
course
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
but
it
would
cover
an
injury
by
a
single
person
as
well
as
a
conspiracy
and
many
other
types
of
interference
of
course.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
none
whatever,
no
question,
whatever.
the
indictment
alleges
that
the
plan
and
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
of
the
appellees
were
to
dissuade
these
travelers
and
other
negroes
from
seeking
service
at
the
establishment
on
the
same
basis
as
white
citizens.
the
district
court
recognized
as
indeed
this
court's
decisions
require
that
section
241
protects
all
federal
rights
derived
directly
from
the
constitution
or
created
by
acts
of
congress.
and
that
the
instant
prosecution
has
a
clear
statutory
basis,
unless
the
public
accommodations
law
itself
manifests
an
unmistakable
purpose
to
exclude
the
rights
created
by
that
law
from
the
protection
of
the
criminal
law.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
public
accommodations
law
does
gives
in
to
that
purpose.
although
we
recognize
full
well
that
the
matter
of
accommodating
the
statutes
is
one
not
free
from
difficulty.
we
urge
that
section
241
has
not
been
excluded
from
its
historic
role
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
for
reasons
which
i
shall
develop
in
analyzing
the
public
accommodations
law.
the
principle
circumstance
which
i
have
in
mind
is
that
this
case
does
not
involve
a
charge
that
a
proprietor
denied
service
which
he
was
under
a
duty
to
accord,
but
rather
a
charge
that
a
group
of
outsiders
committed
a
punitive
assault
upon
persons
who
had
asserted
their
federal
right
to
seek
and
obtain
such
service.
now
title
2
of
the
public
accommodations
act,
section
201
begins
with
the
declaration
that
all
persons
shall
be
entitled
to
the
full
and
equal
enjoyment
of
places
defined
in
the
act
as
places
of
public
accommodation
without
discrimination
or
segregation.
there's
no
question
as
this
case
comes
here
that
the
facilities
involved
constituted
a
covered
establishment.
it
is
also
settled
of
course,
notably
by
this
court's
atlanta
motel
decision
that
title
2
is
a
valid
implementation
of
the
commerce
power.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
only
real
question
is
whether
the
public
accommodations
law
itself
shows
a
design
to
confine
federal
proceedings
involving
an
assault
upon
the
right
to
public
accommodations
to
actions
for
injunctive
relief.
and
that
of
course
requires
a
further
examination
of
the
act
scheme.
section
203
goes
on
to
provide
that
no
person
shall
withhold
the
privileges
or
interfere
with
the
rights
declared
by
section
201.
section
204
then
provides
for
preventive
relief
as
against
any
person
who
engages
in
conduct
prohibited
by
section
203.
a
civil
action
may
be
instituted
by
the
party
aggrieved
and
the
court
may
permit
intervention
by
the
attorney
general
upon
his
certification
that
the
matter
is
of
general
public
importance.
i
note
parenthetically
that
another
section
of
the
act,
section
206
permits
the
attorney
general
to
institute
a
suit
in
his
own
right
a
prevent
--
an
injunctive
suit
in
his
own
right.
if
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
denial
of
statutory
rights
is
part
of
a
pattern
or
practice.
returning
to
section
204,
it
carries
the
qualification
that
the
action
for
injunctive
relief
may
not
be
instituted
without
prior
notice
to
state
or
local
authority
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
state
or
a
local
law
prohibiting
the
same
type
of
discriminatory
conduct.
30
days
after
the
giving
of
such
notice
however,
the
federal
proceeding
may
be
filed.
section
204
also
authorizes
the
district
court
even
where
there
is
no
overlapping
state
or
local
law
to
differ
the
injunctive
suit
for
not
more
than
60
days
in
order
to
utilize
the
offices
of
the
community
relations
service
which
was
created
also
by
the
1964
act.
against
that
background,
i'd
like
to
refer
your
honors
to
section
207.
that
section
after
conferring
jurisdiction
upon
the
united
states
district
courts
to
consider
actions
for
injunctive
relief,
contains
the
critical
language
appearing
in
paragraph
b
which
is
set
forth
at
page
2
at
the
government's
brief
and
begins
with
the
words,
“the
remedies
provided
in
this
title
shall
be
the
exclusive
means
of
enforcing
the
rights
based
on
this
title”,
and
then
goes
on
with
other
language
with
which
i
shall
also
deal
in
a
few
moments.
turning
initially
to
that
first
exclusive
remedy
language,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
word
remedies
ordinarily
connotes
civil
relief.
similarly,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
concept
of
enforcement
of
rights
connotes
a
suit
by
the
person
aggrieved
directed
against
those
person
who
have
the
correlative
duty,
here,
the
duty
to
provide
the
facilities
or
to
render
the
service.
thus,
we
have
no
hesitancy
in
arguing,
we
think
numerous
cases
support
the
general
proposition.
that
as
a
general
rule,
a
provision
describing
a
civil
remedy
here,
the
remedy
of
injunction
as
exclusive,
need
not
be
construed
to
preclude
the
application
of
the
relevant
criminal
law.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
authorizes
injunctions
against
any
person
who
violates
the
act
or
interferes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
a
duty
which
may
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
be
dealt
with
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
by
a
civil
remedy,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
that
is
right.
the
injunctive
remedy
is
not
restricted
to
proprietors
but
is
available
as
against
to
any
person
who
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
violates
the
rights
or
duties
conferred.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
yes,
yes,
i
don't
question
that
for
a
moment
and
i
would
add
that
the
facts
of
this
case
rather
sharply
illustrate
however
in
our
view
the
reason
for
the
rule
of
construction
which
says
that
ordinarily
a
provision
for
the
exclusivity
of
a
civil
remedy
does
not
preclude
a
criminal
proceeding
in
vindication
of
the
public
interest
that
may
be
involved.
and
i
say
that
because
an
injunctive
proceeding
may
well
be
effective
against
a
proprietor
to
ensure
future
service.
it
may
have
some
utility
in
injunctive
proceeding
if
there
is
a
continuing
course
of
interference
to
bring
that
interference
to
a
halt.
in
the
case
of
episodic
attacks
by
different
persons
or
different
groups
of
persons
upon
those
who
seek
service
or
have
sought
service,
an
injunction
is
in
utterly
inefficacious
method
because
it
can
hardly
deter
groups
who
are
engaged
in
these
episodic
attacks,
if
those
same
groups
are
not
continually
engaging
in
that
course
of
conduct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
the
court
found
no
occasion
to
reach
it
because
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
it
isn't
reached
and
guessed
because
the
court
agreed
with
the
district
--
that
the
district
court
there
had
construed
the
indictment
as
defective
and
the
statutory
issue
of
coverage
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
was
never
reached.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
you
said
the
appeal
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
did
not
properly
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
(inaudible)
of
this
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
expressly
left
open
in
your
honors'
opinion
for
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
right
is
the
right
to
the
equal
enjoyment
to
the
free
exercise
of
the
right
to
enjoyment
of
public
accommodations
and
that
alone.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
indictment
which
is
at
page
2
of
the
record
is
predicated
directly
upon
title
2
as
your
honor
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
will
see
about
two-thirds
all
the
way
down,
title
2
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
the
public
accommodations
law.
now
if
the
general
proposition
i
have
stated
is
sound,
namely
that
the
provision
of
an
exclusive
civil
remedy
does
not
necessarily
preclude
the
application
of
criminal
law,
it
brings
me
perhaps
part
of
the
distance
but
not
the
full
way.
first
i
think
i
have
to
face
the
matter
of
the
remaining
language
in
section
207
(b),
which
also
requires
interpretation.
and
secondly,
it
becomes
necessary
i
think
to
consider
the
legislative
history
of
title
2
which
i
shall
concede,
places
some
loss
upon
section
207
and
does
require
the
conclusion
that
at
least
in
some
circumstances,
namely
where
the
criminal
proceeding
is
--
might
be
brought
against
the
proprietor,
that
congress
meant
to
rely
exclusively
upon
injunctive
remedy.
let
me
first
address
myself
to
the
language
of
section
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
was
only
referring
to
the
availability
of
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
that
brings
me
directly
to
the
latter
half
of
section
207
(b)
which
contains
the
proviso
after
saying
that
the
remedies
provided
by
this
act
shall
be
exclusive.
but
nothing
in
this
title
shall
preclude
any
individual
or
any
state
or
local
agency
from
asserting
rights
based
on
federal
or
state
law
not
inconsistent
with
this
title.
and
then
you
will
note
goes
on
to
save
the
pursuit
of
any
remedy,
civil
or
criminal
which
may
be
available
for
the
vindication
or
enforcement
of
such
right.
now
appellees
point
out
that
this
explicitly
preserves
the
availability
of
a
state
criminal
proceeding
and
argue
that
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
writing
of
this
limited
exception
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
preserve
the
availability
of
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
seems
plain
to
us
however
that
there
is
another
reason
for
the
writing
of
this
exception
and
the
form
in
which
it
is
written.
namely
that
in
the
absence
of
an
explicit
provision
preserving
such
state
remedies
as
might
exist
in
such
state
criminal
laws
as
might
appertain.
it
might
well
be
concluded
that
federal
law
had
preempted
the
field.
now
that
interpretation
is
not
idle
speculation.
the
relevant
report
of
the
house
of
judiciary
committee,
and
that's
house
report
915
of
the
88th
congress
to
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
states
after
summarizing
the
language
of
the
exclusive
remedy
provision,
and
i'll
quote
it
exactly,
“thus
state
anti-discrimination
laws
not
inconsistent
with
title
2
would
not
be
preempted.”
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
true.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
more
serious
question
of
congress'
understanding
here.
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
debate,
a
number
of
senators
and
your
honors
may
recall
that
the
1964
act
did
not
go
through
a
committee
in
the
senate
that
was
brought
directly
onto
the
senate
calendar.
a
number
of
senators
expressed
the
view
during
the
debate
that
the
act
was
a
moderate
one.
they
said
it
was
moderate
because
it
provided
for
efforts
at
conciliation
in
the
first
instance.
moderate
because
it
preserved
procedures
afforded
by
state
law
where
state
law
provided
such
procedures.
and
moderate
finally
because
it
authorized
federal
injunctive
actions
rather
than
federal
suits
for
damages
or
federal
criminal
prosecutions.
these
senators,
most
of
them
advocates
of
the
legislation,
gave
assurance
that
proprietors
of
restaurants
and
of
other
places
of
public
accommodation
would
not
be
prosecuted
or
subjected
to
damage
suits
as
a
result
of
the
proposed
enactment
of
this
title.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
he
joined
with
outsiders
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
so
he'd
have
a
conspiracy.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say
that
he
lost
any
field
also.
and
you're
quite
right,
the
legislative
history
in
referring
to
the
--
in
giving
this
assurance
that
proprietors
would
not
be
prosecuted
did
not
refer
to
assaults,
they
refer
to
denials
of
service.
in
addition
the
solicitude
i
emphasize
was
expressed
solely
on
behalf
of
proprietors.
thus
senator
humphrey
who
i
think
spoke
more
fully
to
this
matter
than
any
of
the
other
sponsors
of
the
legislation,
explained
that
a
proprietor
who
failed
to
give
service.perhaps
he
said
because
of
heavy
community
pressures.
perhaps
because
he
might
have
a
bona
fide
doubt
as
to
whether
his
place
of
business
was
a
covered
establishment
under
the
act.
such
a
proprietor,
said
senator
humphrey,
would
not
be
prosecuted
by
the
attorney
general
and
he
noted
the
attorney
general's
agreement
on
this
point.
i
repeat
however,
at
no
point
was
it
suggested
by
anyone
that
if
the
clan
or
some
gang
of
outsiders
were
to
engage
in
a
punitive
assault
upon
those
who
have
sought
or
had
obtained
service
that
such
person
would
gain
immunity
or
persons
would
gain
immunity
and
that
the
historic
office
of
section
241
would
in
such
circumstances
go
unfilled.
i
shan't
labor
further
here
the
details
of
this
history
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
but
would
like
to
proceed
for
the
moment
upon
the
assumption
that
the
court
upon
its
independent
examination
of
that
history
will
agree
with
what
i
have
described
as
the
sense
of
congress.
now
on
this
assumption,
i'd
like
to
go
back
for
a
moment
and
deal
with
the
question
how
we
think
this
statute
is
to
be
read.
and
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
restate
if
i
may
our
textual
analysis
in
summary
form.
our
first
proposition
is
that
the
language
of
section
207
(b)
does
not
operate
of
its
own
force
to
exclude
the
possibility
in
all
circumstances
of
a
federal
criminal
proceeding.
secondly,
we
concede
that
congress
did
not
contemplate
that
proprietors
would
be
prosecuted
under
federal
law
for
a
mere
denial
of
services.
and
i'd
say
that
one
can
readily
accommodate
tis
congressional
intention
within
the
language
of
section
207
(b).
one
can
properly
say,
i
think
in
other
words,
that
congress
apparently
regarded
a
prosecution
of
a
proprietor
for
a
mere
denial
of
service
as
coming
within
the
concept
of
a
remedy
for
enforcing
the
rights
created
by
title
2
and
that
it
elected
to
foreclose
that
remedy
in
favor
of
injunctive
action.
our
third
and
final
proposition
is
that
this
does
not
require,
does
not
require
a
similar
holding
in
the
case
of
a
conspiracy
by
outsiders
which
is
what
is
involved
here
to
engage
in
a
punitive
assault
upon
those
who
have
exercised
or
have
thought
to
exercise
their
rights
under
title
2.
i've
observed
that
we
think
there's
no
persuasive
evidence
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
to
preclude
such
prosecution,
and
as
a
matter
of
textual
construction
we
believe
that
the
court
may
properly
hold
that
a
prosecution
of
persons
who
engage
in
such
a
punitive
expedition
is
not
a
remedy
or
means
of
enforcing
title
2
rights.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
--
my
comment
on
that
your
honor
was
that
the
house
committee
report
explained
that
its
purpose
was
to
make
clear
that
state
law
was
not
preempted.
getting
back
to
our
construction
of
207
(b),
we
urge
that
a
right
to
the
enjoyment
of
public
accommodations
and
enforcement
of
that
right
runs
against
those
who
have
the
correlative
duty
to
provide
the
facilities
or
service.
and
that
a
prosecution
of
those
who
have
engaged
in
a
punitive
assault
because
other
persons
have
exercised
their
rights
is
not
a
proceeding
to
enforce
the
right
to
service
as
such.
rather,
it
is
a
prosecution
to
deal
with
the
kind
of
conspiratorial
injury
which
is
embraced
by
section
241.
in
other
words,
we
distinguish
between
proceedings
to
enforce
the
substantive
right
to
the
enjoinment
of
equal
accommodations
and
proceedings
to
vindicate
the
public
interest
in
deterring
concerted
assaults
upon
those
who
have
exercised
their
civil
rights,
because
we
think
that
distinction
is
an
important
one
and
that
it
is
in
--
it
is
consistent
with
the
text
and
certainly
in
keeping
with
the
essential
statutory
purposes.
we
urge
that
this
indictment
states
in
offense
under
section
241
and
that
it
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
whether
sporadic
or
continuing,
they
would
be
the
attackers
or
assaulters
would
be
subject
to
section
241.
the
reference
to
a
sporadic
attack
which
i
made
before
was
by
way
of
emphasizing
the
ineffectiveness,
the
inadequacy
in
that
circumstance
of
a
purely
injunctive
remedy.
thank
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
had
--
don't
wish
to
attempt
to
go
over
any
of
the
same
ground.
i
did
wonder
for
--
very
briefly
to
two
points
which
were
suggested
by
counsel.
one
was
the
suggestion
that
under
our
view
of
the
exclusive
remedy
provision,
no
function
would
be
really
served
by
that
provision.
mr.
thompson
suggested
that
in
no
event
could
the
government
have
prosecuted
a
proprietor
for
the
denial
of
service.
and
now
it's
true
that
section
241
requires
the
participation
of
more
than
one
person,
because
it
is
a
conspiracy
statute,
but
section
241
does
not
require
that
the
conduct
be
violent
or
that
it
be
an
assault.
a
passive
denial
of
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states
if
participated
in
by
two
or
more
persons
would
subject
that
person
to
a
prosecution
under
that
section.
so
that
consequently
in
the
absence
of
some
provision
by
congress
immunizing
a
proprietor,
a
proprietorship
which
consisted
of
a
partnership
could
be
prosecuted
for
denying
service.
i
would
suppose
a
proprietor
and
the
waitress
could
be
prosecuted
if
they
denied
service
to
a
costumer.
now
we
agree
that
congress
didn't
want
that
and
that
the
language
of
section
207
(b)
may
properly
be
read
to
exclude
it.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
that
language
does
not
have
to
be
read
to
exclude
every
kind
of
conspiracy
or
attack
upon
the
exercise
of
federal
rights
which
might
be
covered
by
section
241.
one
final
word
as
to
the
point
that
congress
rejected,
a
proposal
for
an
explicit
criminal
sanction
in
this
act,
the
proposal
for
a
criminal
sanction
was
made
by
senator
thurman
and
various
other
opponents
of
the
legislation.
they
proposed
to
write
out
all
of
the
injunctive
provisions
of
the
act
and
to
substitute
a
misdemeanor
provision.
this
was
objected
to
by
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
on
the
ground
that
it
would
make
the
act
ineffective.
congress
feared
that
the
juries
would
be
quite
reluctant
to
convict
in
cases
of
this
kind
in
some
communities,
and
congress
felt
it
important
to
have
an
injunctive
remedy
available.
so
that
the
only
criminal
provision
which
was
explicitly
proposed
was
proposed
only
by
opponents
of
the
legislation
who
were
criticized
by
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
on
the
ground
that
they
were
seeking
to
make
the
act
inefficacious.
thank
you.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
case
comes
here
by
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
seeking
reinstatement
of
an
indictment
which
was
brought
under
section
241
of
the
criminal
code.
that
section
which
as
your
honors
know
was
inspired
originally
by
the
activities
of
the
ku
klux
klan
and
it
dates
back
to
1870,
punishes
any
conspiracy
to
injure,
intimidate
or
oppress
a
citizen
because
of
his
exercise
of
any
right
or
privilege
secured
to
him
by
the
constitution
or
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
indictment
here
charged
that
the
four
appellees
had
conspired
to
injure
and
intimidate
three
negro
citizens
because
the
latter
had
exercised
their
rights
guaranteed
by
the
public
accommodations
title
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
to
patronize
a
roadside
restaurant.
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
concluded
that
the
provisions
for
injunctive
relief
which
appear
in
that
1964
act
constitute
the
exclusive
means
of
dealing
with
a
violation
of
the
public
accommodations
law,
and
that
those
provisions
preclude
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
it
accordingly
dismissed
the
indictment.
since
this
case
has
not
gone
to
trial,
the
facts
have
not
been
fully
developed.
i
think
it
suffices
to
say
that
the
basis
of
the
prosecution
is
that
the
appellees,
persons
wholly
unconnected
with
the
restaurant
or
truck
stop
where
this
incident
occurred
severely
attacked
and
beat
the
negro
travelers
in
question.
after
those
travelers
had
sought
and
obtained
service
and
were
returning
from
the
restaurant
to
their
parked
automobile.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it
would
cover
much
more
of
course
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
but
it
would
cover
an
injury
by
a
single
person
as
well
as
a
conspiracy
and
many
other
types
of
interference
of
course.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
none
whatever,
no
question,
whatever.
the
indictment
alleges
that
the
plan
and
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
of
the
appellees
were
to
dissuade
these
travelers
and
other
negroes
from
seeking
service
at
the
establishment
on
the
same
basis
as
white
citizens.
the
district
court
recognized
as
indeed
this
court's
decisions
require
that
section
241
protects
all
federal
rights
derived
directly
from
the
constitution
or
created
by
acts
of
congress.
and
that
the
instant
prosecution
has
a
clear
statutory
basis,
unless
the
public
accommodations
law
itself
manifests
an
unmistakable
purpose
to
exclude
the
rights
created
by
that
law
from
the
protection
of
the
criminal
law.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
public
accommodations
law
does
gives
in
to
that
purpose.
although
we
recognize
full
well
that
the
matter
of
accommodating
the
statutes
is
one
not
free
from
difficulty.
we
urge
that
section
241
has
not
been
excluded
from
its
historic
role
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
for
reasons
which
i
shall
develop
in
analyzing
the
public
accommodations
law.
the
principle
circumstance
which
i
have
in
mind
is
that
this
case
does
not
involve
a
charge
that
a
proprietor
denied
service
which
he
was
under
a
duty
to
accord,
but
rather
a
charge
that
a
group
of
outsiders
committed
a
punitive
assault
upon
persons
who
had
asserted
their
federal
right
to
seek
and
obtain
such
service.
now
title
2
of
the
public
accommodations
act,
section
201
begins
with
the
declaration
that
all
persons
shall
be
entitled
to
the
full
and
equal
enjoyment
of
places
defined
in
the
act
as
places
of
public
accommodation
without
discrimination
or
segregation.
there's
no
question
as
this
case
comes
here
that
the
facilities
involved
constituted
a
covered
establishment.
it
is
also
settled
of
course,
notably
by
this
court's
atlanta
motel
decision
that
title
2
is
a
valid
implementation
of
the
commerce
power.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
only
real
question
is
whether
the
public
accommodations
law
itself
shows
a
design
to
confine
federal
proceedings
involving
an
assault
upon
the
right
to
public
accommodations
to
actions
for
injunctive
relief.
and
that
of
course
requires
a
further
examination
of
the
act
scheme.
section
203
goes
on
to
provide
that
no
person
shall
withhold
the
privileges
or
interfere
with
the
rights
declared
by
section
201.
section
204
then
provides
for
preventive
relief
as
against
any
person
who
engages
in
conduct
prohibited
by
section
203.
a
civil
action
may
be
instituted
by
the
party
aggrieved
and
the
court
may
permit
intervention
by
the
attorney
general
upon
his
certification
that
the
matter
is
of
general
public
importance.
i
note
parenthetically
that
another
section
of
the
act,
section
206
permits
the
attorney
general
to
institute
a
suit
in
his
own
right
a
prevent
--
an
injunctive
suit
in
his
own
right.
if
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
denial
of
statutory
rights
is
part
of
a
pattern
or
practice.
returning
to
section
204,
it
carries
the
qualification
that
the
action
for
injunctive
relief
may
not
be
instituted
without
prior
notice
to
state
or
local
authority
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
state
or
a
local
law
prohibiting
the
same
type
of
discriminatory
conduct.
30
days
after
the
giving
of
such
notice
however,
the
federal
proceeding
may
be
filed.
section
204
also
authorizes
the
district
court
even
where
there
is
no
overlapping
state
or
local
law
to
differ
the
injunctive
suit
for
not
more
than
60
days
in
order
to
utilize
the
offices
of
the
community
relations
service
which
was
created
also
by
the
1964
act.
against
that
background,
i'd
like
to
refer
your
honors
to
section
207.
that
section
after
conferring
jurisdiction
upon
the
united
states
district
courts
to
consider
actions
for
injunctive
relief,
contains
the
critical
language
appearing
in
paragraph
b
which
is
set
forth
at
page
2
at
the
government's
brief
and
begins
with
the
words,
“the
remedies
provided
in
this
title
shall
be
the
exclusive
means
of
enforcing
the
rights
based
on
this
title”,
and
then
goes
on
with
other
language
with
which
i
shall
also
deal
in
a
few
moments.
turning
initially
to
that
first
exclusive
remedy
language,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
word
remedies
ordinarily
connotes
civil
relief.
similarly,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
concept
of
enforcement
of
rights
connotes
a
suit
by
the
person
aggrieved
directed
against
those
person
who
have
the
correlative
duty,
here,
the
duty
to
provide
the
facilities
or
to
render
the
service.
thus,
we
have
no
hesitancy
in
arguing,
we
think
numerous
cases
support
the
general
proposition.
that
as
a
general
rule,
a
provision
describing
a
civil
remedy
here,
the
remedy
of
injunction
as
exclusive,
need
not
be
construed
to
preclude
the
application
of
the
relevant
criminal
law.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
authorizes
injunctions
against
any
person
who
violates
the
act
or
interferes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
a
duty
which
may
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
be
dealt
with
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
by
a
civil
remedy,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
that
is
right.
the
injunctive
remedy
is
not
restricted
to
proprietors
but
is
available
as
against
to
any
person
who
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
violates
the
rights
or
duties
conferred.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
yes,
yes,
i
don't
question
that
for
a
moment
and
i
would
add
that
the
facts
of
this
case
rather
sharply
illustrate
however
in
our
view
the
reason
for
the
rule
of
construction
which
says
that
ordinarily
a
provision
for
the
exclusivity
of
a
civil
remedy
does
not
preclude
a
criminal
proceeding
in
vindication
of
the
public
interest
that
may
be
involved.
and
i
say
that
because
an
injunctive
proceeding
may
well
be
effective
against
a
proprietor
to
ensure
future
service.
it
may
have
some
utility
in
injunctive
proceeding
if
there
is
a
continuing
course
of
interference
to
bring
that
interference
to
a
halt.
in
the
case
of
episodic
attacks
by
different
persons
or
different
groups
of
persons
upon
those
who
seek
service
or
have
sought
service,
an
injunction
is
in
utterly
inefficacious
method
because
it
can
hardly
deter
groups
who
are
engaged
in
these
episodic
attacks,
if
those
same
groups
are
not
continually
engaging
in
that
course
of
conduct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
the
court
found
no
occasion
to
reach
it
because
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
it
isn't
reached
and
guessed
because
the
court
agreed
with
the
district
--
that
the
district
court
there
had
construed
the
indictment
as
defective
and
the
statutory
issue
of
coverage
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
was
never
reached.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
you
said
the
appeal
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
did
not
properly
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
(inaudible)
of
this
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
expressly
left
open
in
your
honors'
opinion
for
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
right
is
the
right
to
the
equal
enjoyment
to
the
free
exercise
of
the
right
to
enjoyment
of
public
accommodations
and
that
alone.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
indictment
which
is
at
page
2
of
the
record
is
predicated
directly
upon
title
2
as
your
honor
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
will
see
about
two-thirds
all
the
way
down,
title
2
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
the
public
accommodations
law.
now
if
the
general
proposition
i
have
stated
is
sound,
namely
that
the
provision
of
an
exclusive
civil
remedy
does
not
necessarily
preclude
the
application
of
criminal
law,
it
brings
me
perhaps
part
of
the
distance
but
not
the
full
way.
first
i
think
i
have
to
face
the
matter
of
the
remaining
language
in
section
207
(b),
which
also
requires
interpretation.
and
secondly,
it
becomes
necessary
i
think
to
consider
the
legislative
history
of
title
2
which
i
shall
concede,
places
some
loss
upon
section
207
and
does
require
the
conclusion
that
at
least
in
some
circumstances,
namely
where
the
criminal
proceeding
is
--
might
be
brought
against
the
proprietor,
that
congress
meant
to
rely
exclusively
upon
injunctive
remedy.
let
me
first
address
myself
to
the
language
of
section
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
was
only
referring
to
the
availability
of
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
that
brings
me
directly
to
the
latter
half
of
section
207
(b)
which
contains
the
proviso
after
saying
that
the
remedies
provided
by
this
act
shall
be
exclusive.
but
nothing
in
this
title
shall
preclude
any
individual
or
any
state
or
local
agency
from
asserting
rights
based
on
federal
or
state
law
not
inconsistent
with
this
title.
and
then
you
will
note
goes
on
to
save
the
pursuit
of
any
remedy,
civil
or
criminal
which
may
be
available
for
the
vindication
or
enforcement
of
such
right.
now
appellees
point
out
that
this
explicitly
preserves
the
availability
of
a
state
criminal
proceeding
and
argue
that
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
writing
of
this
limited
exception
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
preserve
the
availability
of
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
seems
plain
to
us
however
that
there
is
another
reason
for
the
writing
of
this
exception
and
the
form
in
which
it
is
written.
namely
that
in
the
absence
of
an
explicit
provision
preserving
such
state
remedies
as
might
exist
in
such
state
criminal
laws
as
might
appertain.
it
might
well
be
concluded
that
federal
law
had
preempted
the
field.
now
that
interpretation
is
not
idle
speculation.
the
relevant
report
of
the
house
of
judiciary
committee,
and
that's
house
report
915
of
the
88th
congress
to
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
states
after
summarizing
the
language
of
the
exclusive
remedy
provision,
and
i'll
quote
it
exactly,
“thus
state
anti-discrimination
laws
not
inconsistent
with
title
2
would
not
be
preempted.”
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
true.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
more
serious
question
of
congress'
understanding
here.
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
debate,
a
number
of
senators
and
your
honors
may
recall
that
the
1964
act
did
not
go
through
a
committee
in
the
senate
that
was
brought
directly
onto
the
senate
calendar.
a
number
of
senators
expressed
the
view
during
the
debate
that
the
act
was
a
moderate
one.
they
said
it
was
moderate
because
it
provided
for
efforts
at
conciliation
in
the
first
instance.
moderate
because
it
preserved
procedures
afforded
by
state
law
where
state
law
provided
such
procedures.
and
moderate
finally
because
it
authorized
federal
injunctive
actions
rather
than
federal
suits
for
damages
or
federal
criminal
prosecutions.
these
senators,
most
of
them
advocates
of
the
legislation,
gave
assurance
that
proprietors
of
restaurants
and
of
other
places
of
public
accommodation
would
not
be
prosecuted
or
subjected
to
damage
suits
as
a
result
of
the
proposed
enactment
of
this
title.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
he
joined
with
outsiders
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
so
he'd
have
a
conspiracy.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say
that
he
lost
any
field
also.
and
you're
quite
right,
the
legislative
history
in
referring
to
the
--
in
giving
this
assurance
that
proprietors
would
not
be
prosecuted
did
not
refer
to
assaults,
they
refer
to
denials
of
service.
in
addition
the
solicitude
i
emphasize
was
expressed
solely
on
behalf
of
proprietors.
thus
senator
humphrey
who
i
think
spoke
more
fully
to
this
matter
than
any
of
the
other
sponsors
of
the
legislation,
explained
that
a
proprietor
who
failed
to
give
service.perhaps
he
said
because
of
heavy
community
pressures.
perhaps
because
he
might
have
a
bona
fide
doubt
as
to
whether
his
place
of
business
was
a
covered
establishment
under
the
act.
such
a
proprietor,
said
senator
humphrey,
would
not
be
prosecuted
by
the
attorney
general
and
he
noted
the
attorney
general's
agreement
on
this
point.
i
repeat
however,
at
no
point
was
it
suggested
by
anyone
that
if
the
clan
or
some
gang
of
outsiders
were
to
engage
in
a
punitive
assault
upon
those
who
have
sought
or
had
obtained
service
that
such
person
would
gain
immunity
or
persons
would
gain
immunity
and
that
the
historic
office
of
section
241
would
in
such
circumstances
go
unfilled.
i
shan't
labor
further
here
the
details
of
this
history
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
but
would
like
to
proceed
for
the
moment
upon
the
assumption
that
the
court
upon
its
independent
examination
of
that
history
will
agree
with
what
i
have
described
as
the
sense
of
congress.
now
on
this
assumption,
i'd
like
to
go
back
for
a
moment
and
deal
with
the
question
how
we
think
this
statute
is
to
be
read.
and
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
restate
if
i
may
our
textual
analysis
in
summary
form.
our
first
proposition
is
that
the
language
of
section
207
(b)
does
not
operate
of
its
own
force
to
exclude
the
possibility
in
all
circumstances
of
a
federal
criminal
proceeding.
secondly,
we
concede
that
congress
did
not
contemplate
that
proprietors
would
be
prosecuted
under
federal
law
for
a
mere
denial
of
services.
and
i'd
say
that
one
can
readily
accommodate
tis
congressional
intention
within
the
language
of
section
207
(b).
one
can
properly
say,
i
think
in
other
words,
that
congress
apparently
regarded
a
prosecution
of
a
proprietor
for
a
mere
denial
of
service
as
coming
within
the
concept
of
a
remedy
for
enforcing
the
rights
created
by
title
2
and
that
it
elected
to
foreclose
that
remedy
in
favor
of
injunctive
action.
our
third
and
final
proposition
is
that
this
does
not
require,
does
not
require
a
similar
holding
in
the
case
of
a
conspiracy
by
outsiders
which
is
what
is
involved
here
to
engage
in
a
punitive
assault
upon
those
who
have
exercised
or
have
thought
to
exercise
their
rights
under
title
2.
i've
observed
that
we
think
there's
no
persuasive
evidence
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
to
preclude
such
prosecution,
and
as
a
matter
of
textual
construction
we
believe
that
the
court
may
properly
hold
that
a
prosecution
of
persons
who
engage
in
such
a
punitive
expedition
is
not
a
remedy
or
means
of
enforcing
title
2
rights.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
--
my
comment
on
that
your
honor
was
that
the
house
committee
report
explained
that
its
purpose
was
to
make
clear
that
state
law
was
not
preempted.
getting
back
to
our
construction
of
207
(b),
we
urge
that
a
right
to
the
enjoyment
of
public
accommodations
and
enforcement
of
that
right
runs
against
those
who
have
the
correlative
duty
to
provide
the
facilities
or
service.
and
that
a
prosecution
of
those
who
have
engaged
in
a
punitive
assault
because
other
persons
have
exercised
their
rights
is
not
a
proceeding
to
enforce
the
right
to
service
as
such.
rather,
it
is
a
prosecution
to
deal
with
the
kind
of
conspiratorial
injury
which
is
embraced
by
section
241.
in
other
words,
we
distinguish
between
proceedings
to
enforce
the
substantive
right
to
the
enjoinment
of
equal
accommodations
and
proceedings
to
vindicate
the
public
interest
in
deterring
concerted
assaults
upon
those
who
have
exercised
their
civil
rights,
because
we
think
that
distinction
is
an
important
one
and
that
it
is
in
--
it
is
consistent
with
the
text
and
certainly
in
keeping
with
the
essential
statutory
purposes.
we
urge
that
this
indictment
states
in
offense
under
section
241
and
that
it
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
whether
sporadic
or
continuing,
they
would
be
the
attackers
or
assaulters
would
be
subject
to
section
241.
the
reference
to
a
sporadic
attack
which
i
made
before
was
by
way
of
emphasizing
the
ineffectiveness,
the
inadequacy
in
that
circumstance
of
a
purely
injunctive
remedy.
thank
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
had
--
don't
wish
to
attempt
to
go
over
any
of
the
same
ground.
i
did
wonder
for
--
very
briefly
to
two
points
which
were
suggested
by
counsel.
one
was
the
suggestion
that
under
our
view
of
the
exclusive
remedy
provision,
no
function
would
be
really
served
by
that
provision.
mr.
thompson
suggested
that
in
no
event
could
the
government
have
prosecuted
a
proprietor
for
the
denial
of
service.
and
now
it's
true
that
section
241
requires
the
participation
of
more
than
one
person,
because
it
is
a
conspiracy
statute,
but
section
241
does
not
require
that
the
conduct
be
violent
or
that
it
be
an
assault.
a
passive
denial
of
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states
if
participated
in
by
two
or
more
persons
would
subject
that
person
to
a
prosecution
under
that
section.
so
that
consequently
in
the
absence
of
some
provision
by
congress
immunizing
a
proprietor,
a
proprietorship
which
consisted
of
a
partnership
could
be
prosecuted
for
denying
service.
i
would
suppose
a
proprietor
and
the
waitress
could
be
prosecuted
if
they
denied
service
to
a
costumer.
now
we
agree
that
congress
didn't
want
that
and
that
the
language
of
section
207
(b)
may
properly
be
read
to
exclude
it.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
that
language
does
not
have
to
be
read
to
exclude
every
kind
of
conspiracy
or
attack
upon
the
exercise
of
federal
rights
which
might
be
covered
by
section
241.
one
final
word
as
to
the
point
that
congress
rejected,
a
proposal
for
an
explicit
criminal
sanction
in
this
act,
the
proposal
for
a
criminal
sanction
was
made
by
senator
thurman
and
various
other
opponents
of
the
legislation.
they
proposed
to
write
out
all
of
the
injunctive
provisions
of
the
act
and
to
substitute
a
misdemeanor
provision.
this
was
objected
to
by
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
on
the
ground
that
it
would
make
the
act
ineffective.
congress
feared
that
the
juries
would
be
quite
reluctant
to
convict
in
cases
of
this
kind
in
some
communities,
and
congress
felt
it
important
to
have
an
injunctive
remedy
available.
so
that
the
only
criminal
provision
which
was
explicitly
proposed
was
proposed
only
by
opponents
of
the
legislation
who
were
criticized
by
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
on
the
ground
that
they
were
seeking
to
make
the
act
inefficacious.
thank
you.
