so
people

justice

created
by

so
these
--
justice

white
--
these
people
were
owed
a

by
the
people
who
attacked

not
to

(inaudible)
the

it

i

yes.
justice

well
that
absent
the
exclusivity
provision,
there
wouldn't
be
really
any
question
about

would
there?
justice

and
so
the
question
is
whether
congress
by

intended
to
preclude
what
otherwise
would
be
a

to
resort

by

absent

would
there
be
any
other

of
enforcing
the

justice

there's
no
other
civil

that
a

that
