mr.
robert
b.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
if
it
please
the
court.
we
have
presented
in
our
brief
substantially
all
that
we
can
say
in
support
of
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment
here
and
we
think
we've
covered
it
rather
fairly.
we
shall
not
attempt
here
to
do
more
than
emphasize
the
points
we
think
most
pertinent.
first
of
all,
we
emphasize
an
argument
we
have
made
in
our
brief,
unless
the
statute
here
in
question,
that
is
section
207
(b)
means
exactly
what
it
says
and
exactly
what
we
have
contended
--
do
contend
that
it
says
then
it
has
no
meaning
at
all,
and
we
would
have
to
attribute
to
congress
the
enactment
of
the
statute
having
no
meaning
which
i
think
this
court
would
not
do.
so
we
have
to
look
for
some
meaning
in
the
statute.
we
submit
that
the
united
states
has
given
us
none,
except
to
say
that
under
the
terms
of
that
statute
sometimes
a
person
can
be
prosecuted
and
sometimes
a
person
can
not
be
prosecuted.
we
submit
that
either
it
excludes
all
prosecutions
or
it
excludes
none
we
refer
to
the
act.
first
of
all
and
i
don't
really
significance
it
is,
i've
turned
over
in
my
mind,
perhaps
the
court
can
find
some
significance
to
it.
we
find
that
the
act
relates
to
all
persons
whereas
such
in
18
u.s.c.
241
relates
only
to
citizens
of
the
united
states.
but
the
first
section
of
the
act
creates
the
rights
that
we
have
under
discussion
here.
mr.
justice
white
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
we
have
some
constitutional
claim
of
these
rights.
it
has
not
been
made
in
the
brief
and
under
the
indictment,
the
rights
that
are
claimed
to
have
been
violated
or
infringed
are
those
created
by
the
act.
in
the
second
place,
the
statute
as
we
quote
on
page
2,
i
believe
it
is
of
our
brief
provides
certain
prohibitions.
these
prohibitions
include
what
the
united
states
here
were
would
divide,
but
it
includes
first
of
all
the
denial
of
any
--
of
these
accommodations
to
any
person.
and
secondly
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
intimidation
or
coercion
with
--
or
threats
with
respect
to
those
who
utilize
these
rights,
avail
themselves
of
them.
and
third,
it
provides
that
no
one
shall
attempt
to
punish
one
for
having
availed
himself
of
these
rights.
this
is
one
single
provision
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
indication
here
that
a
proprietor
and
outsider
shall
be
separated
in
any
way.
this
is
followed
by
the
civil
sanctions
which
have
been
discussed
at
some
length
by
the
united
states
and
with
which
this
court
is
familiar
from
its
discussion
--
of
the
--
in
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel
decision.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel
decision
is
determinative
of
this
case,
but
we
do
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
a
reading
of
the
statute
and
on
a
undoubted
deep
study
of
the
statute,
the
court
there
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
civil
remedies
are
the
only
remedies
available
and
that
criminal
prosecution
cannot
be
pursued.
the
statute
207
which
the
section
which
we
specifically
have
in
mind
and
which
is
really
the
(inaudible)
of
this
litigation,
provides
it
and
i
would
with
the
permission
of
the
court
read
the
statute
and
its
entirety
without
breaking
it
up
by
interrupting.
the
remedies
provided
in
this
title
shall
be
the
exclusive
means
of
enforcing
the
rights
based
on
this
title,
but
nothing
in
this
title
shall
preclude
any
individual
or
any
state
or
local
agency
from
asserting
any
right
based
on
any
other
federal
or
state
law
not
inconsistent
with
this
title,
including
any
statute
or
ordinance
requiring
nondiscrimination
of
public
establishments
--
in
public
establishments
or
accommodations,
or
from
pursuing
any
remedy,
civil
or
criminal,
which
may
be
available
for
the
vindication
or
enforcement
of
such
rights.
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
this
section
says
twice
that
the
united
states
may
not
prosecute
a
violator
under
section
241
or
under
section
242.
first
it
says,
“the
remedy
shall
be
exclusive.”
the
united
states
has
argued
the
term
remedies
must
refer
to
civil
remedies.
however,
in
the
same
statute
we
have
the
word
used
the
second
time
where
it
expressly
states
from
pursuing
any
other
remedy,
civil
or
criminal.
i
don't
think
we
can
attribute
in
a
proper
construction
or
a
proper
reading
of
this
statute,
the
use
of
the
word
to
have
two
different
meanings
without
any
further
explanation
in
that.
certainly
we'd
be
asking
for
a
lot
to
be
implied.
so
in
the
first
instance,
the
statute
provides
that
the
remedy
shall
be
exclusive.
that
is
the
civil
remedy.
in
the
second
instance,
referring
to
any
individual
in
a
state
or
any
local
agency
but
it's
notably
excluding
the
united
states.
it
says
that
any
other
remedy
whether
state
or
federal
may
be
pursued
and
whether
criminal
or
civil.
we
submit
that
these
points
out
determinatively
that
congress
intended
exactly
what
we
have
contended
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact
without
dissecting
the
section,
without
emasculating
it,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
other
fair
construction
that
the
statute
can
be
given
just
attributing
to
it
the
words
that
are
found
therein
and
placing
it
in
the
context
of
the
act.
now
with
reference
to
the
argument
and
we
will
discuss
very
briefly
the
legislative
history
which
has
been
very
well
covered
by
mr.
spritzer,
but
with
reference
to
the
entire
law
in
which
this
section
was
enacted,
we
find
first
of
all
an
attempt
to
--
in
the
argument
here
at
least,
to
state
that
this
section
was
meant
merely
to
exclude
prosecution
in
the
case
of
a
good
faith
proprietor
who
denied
service.
first
of
all,
we
would
answer
that
by
saying
that
section
241
could
not
be
utilized
for
that
purpose
any
way.
a
proprietor
who
only
is
own
(inaudible)
and
without
conspiring
with
someone
else
and
without
being
two
or
more
persons
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
denying
rights.
we
know
of
no
other
federal
statute
under
which
he
could
be
prosecuted.
so
we
submit
that
the
argument
of
the
government
there
fails.
secondly
the
argument
is
made
that
this
is
to
eliminate
the
prosecution
again
of
a
good
faith
proprietor
who
wants
to
test
the
law.
this
could
not
be
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
because
we
have
already
learned
from
this
court
in
--
first
of
all
spruce
v.
united
states
some
25
years
ago,
and
more
recently
in
guest
v.
united
states
that
his
specific
intent
to
violate
the
law
is
intended
any
way.
the
only
reasonable
construction
that
could
be
given
the
statute
giving
the
words
the
clear
meaning
which
they
have
would
be
that
contended
for
here,
and
that
found
to
be
the
construction
given
it
by
the
district
court
below.
with
reference
to
the
legislative
history,
it
is
true
and
the
government
points
rather
heavily
to
the
example
that
senator
humphrey
used.
senator
--
then
senator
humphrey
stated
that
the
--
this
provision
was
placed
in
the
statute
in
part
because
people
would
think
that
otherwise
contend
rather
that
sections
18
245
--
241
and
242
could
be
utilized
to
prosecute
one
who
had
violated
the
terms
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
that
is
correct
sir.
we
do
not
--
we
would
not
contend
to
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
that
is
our
interpretation,
our
understanding
and
our
contention
here
if
it
please
the
court.
now
senator
humphrey
stated
that
the
provisions
and
referring
specifically
to
the
criminal
statutes
that
we
have
referred
to
--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
none
other
that
what
--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
there
is
none
--
no
other
that
i
could
refer
the
court
to.
i
know
of
no
other
sir,
except
--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
perhaps
under
state
law.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
senator
humphrey
and
he
stated
in
to
the
congressional
record
that
he
had
the
aid
of
the
justice
department
in
making
his
summary
of
the
statute,
his
interpretation
and
application
of
the
statute
here,
did
not
--
what
he
affirmatively
did
not
state
that
these
sections
would
not
be
available
to
prosecute
conspirators
under
this
act.
he
did
affirmatively
state
that
this
position
was
placed
in
the
act
to
prevent
any
misapprehension
that
they
might
be
prosecuted
under
it
and
then
gave
an
example.
the
example
related
to
a
good
faith
proprietor
whom
we
have
shown
i
think
by
our
argument
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
anyway.
but
there
was
a
time
and
a
place
in
this
statement
of
senator
humphrey
in
the
record
there
that
if
there
were
any
other
meaning
to
be
given
the
statute
then
that
which
it
reads
on
its
face
it
could
have
been
given
at
that
time.
we've
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
the
only
other
reference
we
have
been
referred
to
concerning
18
u.s.c.
241
and
242
is
found
in
the
testimony
of
the
attorney
general,
the
then
attorney
general
before
a
congressional
committee
in
which
inquiry
was
made
as
to
whether
or
not
the
violations
of
the
public
accommodations
act
as
been
drawn
might
be
prosecutable
under
the
criminal
statutes.
the
attorney
general's
opinion
at
that
time
was
that
they
were
prosecutable
under
the
statutes.
thereafter,
section
207
was
added
to
that.
we
think
this
rather
persuasive
as
to
the
congressional
intent.
we
have
also
pointed
out
as
did
the
district
judge
in
his
opinion
that
an
amendment
to
the
act
was
offered
to
eliminate
this
section
and
substitute
in
lieu
thereof
a
provision
for
criminal
punishment.
it
would
have
been
misdemeanor
punishment
granted,
but
this
was
soundly
defeated.
the
argument
there
made
was
that
we
should
not
have
enforcement
by
injunction
that
we
should
just
go
and
have
criminal
sanctions
and
not
the
civil
sanctions.
we
submit
that
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
public
accommodations
act
arose
from,
as
stated
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
considerable
debate,
considerable
contents
and
considerable
opposition
that
the
act
was
perhaps
not
as
strong
as
the
advocates
of
it
would
want
it
to
be.
perhaps
some
of
them
would
have
wanted
the
sanc
--
criminal
sanctions
that
are
sought
here
to
be
imposed.
this
act
ultimately
was
a
compromise
as
we
understand
the
congressional
record
and
as
we
recall
the
history
of
the
act,
and
perhaps
this
explains
why
no
more
severe
sanctions
are
imposed
under
the
act
than
we
find
any.
as
we
have
stated,
a
reading
of
the
act
does
not
permit
the
construction
that's
offered
by
the
government
here.
we
submit
that
either
all
violations
to
the
act
are
prosecutable
under
241
and
242
are
none
or
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
to
indicate
any
intention
to
the
contrary.
we
would
have
nothing
further
to
offer
in
the
way
of
argument
other
than
what
we
have
in
our
brief
if
the
--
any
members
of
the
court
have
any
question
that
we
could
answer,
we're
going
to
take
--
answering
them.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
thank
you.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
if
it
please
the
court.
we
have
presented
in
our
brief
substantially
all
that
we
can
say
in
support
of
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment
here
and
we
think
we've
covered
it
rather
fairly.
we
shall
not
attempt
here
to
do
more
than
emphasize
the
points
we
think
most
pertinent.
first
of
all,
we
emphasize
an
argument
we
have
made
in
our
brief,
unless
the
statute
here
in
question,
that
is
section
207
(b)
means
exactly
what
it
says
and
exactly
what
we
have
contended
--
do
contend
that
it
says
then
it
has
no
meaning
at
all,
and
we
would
have
to
attribute
to
congress
the
enactment
of
the
statute
having
no
meaning
which
i
think
this
court
would
not
do.
so
we
have
to
look
for
some
meaning
in
the
statute.
we
submit
that
the
united
states
has
given
us
none,
except
to
say
that
under
the
terms
of
that
statute
sometimes
a
person
can
be
prosecuted
and
sometimes
a
person
can
not
be
prosecuted.
we
submit
that
either
it
excludes
all
prosecutions
or
it
excludes
none
we
refer
to
the
act.
first
of
all
and
i
don't
really
significance
it
is,
i've
turned
over
in
my
mind,
perhaps
the
court
can
find
some
significance
to
it.
we
find
that
the
act
relates
to
all
persons
whereas
such
in
18
u.s.c.
241
relates
only
to
citizens
of
the
united
states.
but
the
first
section
of
the
act
creates
the
rights
that
we
have
under
discussion
here.
mr.
justice
white
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
we
have
some
constitutional
claim
of
these
rights.
it
has
not
been
made
in
the
brief
and
under
the
indictment,
the
rights
that
are
claimed
to
have
been
violated
or
infringed
are
those
created
by
the
act.
in
the
second
place,
the
statute
as
we
quote
on
page
2,
i
believe
it
is
of
our
brief
provides
certain
prohibitions.
these
prohibitions
include
what
the
united
states
here
were
would
divide,
but
it
includes
first
of
all
the
denial
of
any
--
of
these
accommodations
to
any
person.
and
secondly
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
intimidation
or
coercion
with
--
or
threats
with
respect
to
those
who
utilize
these
rights,
avail
themselves
of
them.
and
third,
it
provides
that
no
one
shall
attempt
to
punish
one
for
having
availed
himself
of
these
rights.
this
is
one
single
provision
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
indication
here
that
a
proprietor
and
outsider
shall
be
separated
in
any

this
is
followed
by
the
civil
sanctions
which
have
been
discussed
at
some
length
by
the
united
states
and
with
which
this
court
is
familiar
from
its
discussion
--
of
the
--
in
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel
decision.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel
decision
is
determinative
of
this
case,
but
we
do
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
a
reading
of
the
statute
and
on
a
undoubted
deep
study
of
the
statute,
the
court
there
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
civil
remedies
are
the
only
remedies
available
and
that
criminal
prosecution
cannot
be
pursued.
the
statute
207
which
the
section
which
we
specifically
have
in
mind
and
which
is
really
the
(inaudible)
of
this
litigation,
provides
it
and
i
would
with
the
permission
of
the

the

provided

based
on

but
nothing

or
from
pursuing
any
remedy,
civil
or
criminal,
which
may
be
available
for
the
vindication
or
enforcement
of
such
rights.
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
this
section
says
twice
that
the
united
states
may
not
prosecute
a
violator
under
section
241
or
under
section
242.
first
it
says,
“the
remedy
shall
be
exclusive.”
the
united
states
has
argued
the
term
remedies
must
refer
to
civil
remedies.
however,
in
the
same
statute
we
have
the
word
used
the
second
time
where
it
expressly
states
from
pursuing
any
other

civil
or
criminal.
i
don't
think
we
can
attribute
in
a
proper
construction
or
a
proper
reading
of
this
statute,
the
use
of
the
word
to
have
two
different
meanings
without
any
further
explanation
in
that.
certainly
we'd
be
asking
for
a
lot
to
be
implied.
so
in
the
first
instance,
the
statute
provides
that
the
remedy
shall
be
exclusive.
that
is
the
civil
remedy.
in
the
second
instance,
referring
to
any
individual
in
a
state
or
any
local
agency
but
it's
notably
excluding
the
united
states.
it
says
that
any
other
remedy
whether
state
or
federal
may
be
pursued
and
whether
criminal
or
civil.
we
submit
that
these
points
out
determinatively
that
congress
intended
exactly
what
we
have
contended
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact
without
dissecting
the
section,
without
emasculating
it,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
other
fair
construction
that
the
statute
can
be
given
just
attributing
to
it
the
words
that
are
found
therein
and
placing
it
in
the
context
of
the
act.
now
with
reference
to
the
argument
and
we
will
discuss
very
briefly
the
legislative
history
which
has
been
very
well
covered
by
mr.
spritzer,
but
with
reference
to
the
entire
law
in
which
this
section
was
enacted,
we
find
first
of
all
an
attempt
to
--
in
the
argument
here
at
least,
to
state
that
this
section
was
meant
merely
to
exclude
prosecution
in
the
case
of
a
good
faith
proprietor
who
denied
service.
first
of
all,
we
would
answer
that
by
saying
that
section
241
could
not
be
utilized
for
that
purpose
any
way.
a
proprietor
who
only
is
own
(inaudible)
and
without
conspiring
with
someone
else
and
without
being
two
or
more
persons
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
denying
rights.
we
know
of
no
other
federal
statute
under
which
he
could
be
prosecuted.
so
we
submit
that
the
argument
of
the
government
there
fails.
secondly
the
argument
is
made
that
this
is
to
eliminate
the
prosecution
again
of
a
good
faith
proprietor
who
wants
to
test
the
law.
this
could
not
be
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
because
we
have
already
learned
from
this
court
in
--
first
of
all
spruce
v.
united
states
some
25
years
ago,
and
more
recently
in
guest
v.
united
states
that
his
specific
intent
to
violate
the
law
is
intended
any
way.
the
only
reasonable
construction
that
could
be
given
the
statute
giving
the
words
the
clear
meaning
which
they
have
would
be
that
contended
for
here,
and
that
found
to
be
the
construction
given
it
by
the
district
court
below.
with
reference
to
the
legislative
history,
it
is
true
and
the
government
points
rather
heavily
to
the
example
that
senator
humphrey
used.
senator
--
then
senator
humphrey
stated
that
the
--
this
provision
was
placed
in
the
statute
in
part
because
people
would
think
that
otherwise
contend
rather
that
sections
18
245
--
241
and
242
could
be
utilized
to
prosecute
one
who
had
violated
the
terms
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
that
is
correct
sir.
we
do
not
--
we
would
not
contend
to
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
that
is
our
interpretation,
our
understanding
and
our
contention
here
if
it
please
the
court.
now
senator
humphrey
stated
that
the
provisions
and
referring
specifically
to
the
criminal
statutes
that
we
have
referred
to
--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
none
other
that
what
--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
there
is
none
--
no
other
that
i
could
refer
the
court
to.
i
know
of
no
other
sir,
except
--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
perhaps
under
state
law.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
senator
humphrey
and
he
stated
in
to
the
congressional
record
that
he
had
the
aid
of
the
justice
department
in
making
his
summary
of
the
statute,
his
interpretation
and
application
of
the
statute
here,
did
not
--
what
he
affirmatively
did
not
state
that
these
sections
would
not
be
available
to
prosecute
conspirators
under
this
act.
he
did
affirmatively
state
that
this
position
was
placed
in
the
act
to
prevent
any
misapprehension
that
they
might
be
prosecuted
under
it
and
then
gave
an
example.
the
example
related
to
a
good
faith
proprietor
whom
we
have
shown
i
think
by
our
argument
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
anyway.
but
there
was
a
time
and
a
place
in
this
statement
of
senator
humphrey
in
the
record
there
that
if
there
were
any
other
meaning
to
be
given
the
statute
then
that
which
it
reads
on
its
face
it
could
have
been
given
at
that
time.
we've
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
the
only
other
reference
we
have
been
referred
to
concerning
18
u.s.c.
241
and
242
is
found
in
the
testimony
of
the
attorney
general,
the
then
attorney
general
before
a
congressional
committee
in
which
inquiry
was
made
as
to
whether
or
not
the
violations
of
the
public
accommodations
act
as
been
drawn
might
be
prosecutable
under
the
criminal
statutes.
the
attorney
general's
opinion
at
that
time
was
that
they
were
prosecutable
under
the
statutes.
thereafter,
section
207
was
added
to
that.
we
think
this
rather
persuasive
as
to
the
congressional
intent.
we
have
also
pointed
out
as
did
the
district
judge
in
his
opinion
that
an
amendment
to
the
act
was
offered
to
eliminate
this
section
and
substitute
in
lieu
thereof
a
provision
for
criminal
punishment.
it
would
have
been
misdemeanor
punishment
granted,
but
this
was
soundly
defeated.
the
argument
there
made
was
that
we
should
not
have
enforcement
by
injunction
that
we
should
just
go
and
have
criminal
sanctions
and
not
the
civil
sanctions.
we
submit
that
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
public
accommodations
act
arose
from,
as
stated
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
considerable
debate,
considerable
contents
and
considerable
opposition
that
the
act
was
perhaps
not
as
strong
as
the
advocates
of
it
would
want
it
to
be.
perhaps
some
of
them
would
have
wanted
the
sanc
--
criminal
sanctions
that
are
sought
here
to
be
imposed.
this
act
ultimately
was
a
compromise
as
we
understand
the
congressional
record
and
as
we
recall
the
history
of
the
act,
and
perhaps
this
explains
why
no
more
severe
sanctions
are
imposed
under
the
act
than
we
find
any.
as
we
have
stated,
a
reading
of
the
act
does
not
permit
the
construction
that's
offered
by
the
government
here.
we
submit
that
either
all
violations
to
the
act
are
prosecutable
under
241
and
242
are
none
or
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
to
indicate
any
intention
to
the
contrary.
we
would
have
nothing
further
to
offer
in
the
way
of
argument
other
than
what
we
have
in
our
brief
if
the
--
any
members
of
the
court
have
any
question
that
we
could
answer,
we're
going
to
take
--
answering
them.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
thank
you.
