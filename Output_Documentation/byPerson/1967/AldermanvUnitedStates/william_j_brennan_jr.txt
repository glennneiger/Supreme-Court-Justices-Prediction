justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
mr.
williams,
you
don't
read
the
government
as
saying,
well
even
if
in
alderman
disclose
it
to
the
defense,
the
protective
orders
to
take
care
of
the
problem
well
how
it
will
be
in
that
case
sufficient.
we
don't
--
we
didn't
say
but
nevertheless
in
a
national
security
case
it's
not.
there
are
other
considerations
in
a
national
security
case
which
argued
for
the
in
camera
submission
you
not
--
you
don't
read
the
government
as
making
that
distinction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
are
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
forgot
about
this
but
i
wondered
if
we'll
hear
it
from
the
solicitor
general
but
at
least
you
don't
read
them
as
saying
that
if
--
even
if
we
lose
out
in
alderman,
nevertheless
there
are
elements
in
the
national
security
cases
which
justify
an
in
camera
proceedings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
weren't
the
two
others
involved
in
this
case
besides
these
two
defendants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
whether
or
not
involved
in
this
whole
episode,
others
with
ivanov
and
butenko
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
etcetera?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
say
mr.
williams,
you
don't
go
as
far
at
least
as
to
suggest
that
all
rules
of
standing
in
this
area
should
be
abolished
and
that
the
interests
in
deterrence
of
illegal
law
enforcement
activity
should
lead
us
to
say
that
the
government
can
never
used
anything
that
it's
obtained
illegally.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
go
that
far,
do
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
do
you
start
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
abolished
all
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
that,
mr.
williams,
suppose
out
in
san
francisco,
the
government
illegally
bugs
a
place
and
they
happen
to
overhear
a
conversation
in
which
john
jones
name
is
mentioned,
they
weren't
looking
for
john
jones
name
and
nothing
whatever
about
john
jones.
but
out
of
something
they
heard,
they
look
into
john
jones
and
find
he's
been
guilty
of
income
tax
evasion
and
they
prosecuted
him
in
the
district
for
income
tax
evasion.
would
he
have
standing
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
because
he
was
the
subject
matter
although
the
government
quite
was
utterly
innocent,
even
if
his
existence
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
ask
you
how
really
how
far
short
you
are
going
of
asking
as
to
abolish
all
rules
standing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you're
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
if
it
isn't
tantamount
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
really
sounds
to
me
at
least
in
the
area
of
electronic
surveillance
what
you're
suggesting
mr.
williams
is
that
that
the
only
practical
way
of
really
to
make
deterrents
meaningful
is
just
to
bar
the
government
from
using
in
the
electronic
surveillance
illegally
obtained
in
any
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
comes
to
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
take
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
take
the
case
i've
put
to
you.
jones
in
fact
was
come
upon
through
this
lead
and
they
overheard
san
francisco
conversation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
jones
doesn't
know
this.
jones
knows
nothing
about
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
the
government
tells
jones
and
tells
his
lawyer
nothing
about
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
would
become
i
should
suppose
standard
procedures
done
on
every
criminal
case
that
the
government
bring
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
government
never
undertook
to
say
that
was
not
the
case,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
not
deny
that
the
understanding
is
express
in
the
petition
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
you
or
the
government
itself
would
concede
in
advance
that
deal
with
material
would
be
relevant
and
save
the
judge
with
the
task.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
there
any
significance
in
the
distinction
that
here
we're
dealing
with
something
that
the
government
obtained
illegally
and
then
none
of
those
other
instances,
is
that
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
when
the
court
entered
its
order,
it
was
on
the
premise
that
the
conversations
of
alderisio
that
we
were
concern
with,
were
conversations
conducted
by
a
government
agency
at
his
place
of
business
from
the
footnote
that
you
referred
us
to
in
your
brief.
if
it
were
established
at
the
hearing
that
in
fact
what
you
represented
now
that
they
were
not
--
it
was
not
at
his
place
of
business.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
well,
if
that
were
established
as
a
fact,
what's
left
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
it.
what's
left
of
his
claim
with
standing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
that
you
--
he
bugged
the
conversations
that
were
on
the
street
involving
himself,
conversations
to
which
he
participated
and
now
the
conversations
of
where
he
was
present,
would
we
have
any
problem
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
upon
the
street,
do
you
think
it
would
--
suppose
the
whole
bugging
had
occurred
of
a
conversation
that
took
place
on
the
street
corner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
fact
is,
if
it
was
not
alderisio's
premises
nor
any
premises
in
which
he
had
an
interest
then
i
gather
you
would
limit
his
right
to
the
tapes
of
the
conversations
to
which
he
was
a
party
or
conversations
where
he
was
present?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i'm
just
--
for
myself
at
least,
the
government
seem
to
do
something
here
that
i
didn't
know
was
an
issue
in
the
case,
namely
that
these
were
not
alderisio's
premises.
certainly,
the
original
order
was
written
on
the
premise
that
all
of
this
bugging
took
place
at
business
premises
of
alderisio
in
chicago.
that's
the
way
the
purview
was
written.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
still,
i
want
to
be
clear
about
this
mr.
williams.
if
the
fact
is
that
these
conversations
of
alderisio's
that
were
illegally
bugged
for
conversations
on
premises
not
his
own,
then
you
would
limit
your
demand
i
gather,
not
his
own
or
in
which
he
had
no
interest
to
conversations
in
which
of
his
own
or
conversations
in
his
presence,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
mr.
williams,
you
don't
read
the
government
as

well
even
