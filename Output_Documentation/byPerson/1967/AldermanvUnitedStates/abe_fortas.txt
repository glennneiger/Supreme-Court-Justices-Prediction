justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general,
does
the
--
your
proposal
for
handling
this
material
foreign
with
the
statements
in
the
court's
opinion
in
dennis
with
respect
to
procedure
there,
in
dennis,
as
appears
on
page
875,
the
court's
opinion
i
take
it
was
contemplated
that
the
grand
jury
transcript
might
be
handed
to
the
judge
in
camera
that
the
government
might
file
an
application
for
protective
orders
as
dennis
is
in
unusual
situations
such
as
those
involving
the
nation's
security
or
clear
cut
dangers
to
individuals
who
are
identified
by
the
testimony
produced.
now,
apart
from
the
specific
reasons
that
might
be
advance
to
justify
the
trial
judge
in
refusing
the
turn
over,
the
bugged
recording,
does
the
procedure
that
you
proposed
here
contemplate
that
the
trial
judge's
authority
to
refuse
to
turn
over
material
will
be
limited
to
case
where
application
is
made
by
the
government?
that
specific
parts
to
be
eliminated
and
presumably
that
application
would
be
served
on
the
other
side,
the
other
side
be
greater
in
handicapped
of
course
because
when
they
have
access
to
the
material,
but
that
would
at
least
preserved
the
substance
of
the
points
notify
the
other
side
that
some
material
is
being
withhold,
withheld
and
perhaps
in
general
the
nature,
the
reason
why
in
general
category
it's
being
withheld
and
would
also
preserve
the
matter
on
appeal.
now,
is
the
suggestion
that
you
make
here
differ,
does
the
suggestion
you
make
here
differ
from
that
one
that
i
believe
is
outlined
by
the
court's
opinion
in
dennis?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
also
a
very
important
question
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
it's
also
a
very
important
question
of
notice
and
whether
the
trial
judge
will
proceed
to
look
at
this
material
in
camera
and
then
only
the
government
will
know
that
he
has
cut
out
something
or
withheld
something
and
the
reason
for
him,
the
preservation
of
the
points
for
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
does
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
does
fall
short
of
the
procedure
outlined
by
this
court
in
dennis
with
respect
to
the
grand
jury
transcript.
justice
abe
fortas
and
why
would
you
exclude
the
requirement
for
an
application
so
that
the
other
side
will
at
least
have
notice
that
the
government
has
moved
that
section,
that
material
identified
by
pages
so
and
so
of
the
transcript
let's
say,
applications
made
into
the
court
to
withhold
that
material
for
national
security
reasons,
withhold
other
material
or
grounds
of
relevance.
why
would
you
object
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
that
but
go
ahead.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
put
the
defense
on
notice
so
that
if
they
chose
they
can
--
that's
--
material
has
been
excluded
and
in
general
on
the
basis
of
it
so
that
if
they
choose
they
can
ask
the
appellate
court
to
take
another
look
at
this
and
there
--
thereby
you
have
a
bit
of
supervision
--
justice
abe
fortas
over
the
trial
judge.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
that
is
part
of
your
proposal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
williams,
it's
in
a
little
more
complicated
and
subtle
in
that.
let's
suppose
you
have
a
katz's
type
of
situation
where
those
bugging
of
a
telephone
booth
to
get
information
on
mr.
katz,
and
let's
suppose,
i
don't
believe
this
happened
in
katz,
but
let's
suppose
that
in
the
course
of
that
they
picked
up
telephone
conversations
by
mr.
williams
and
mr.
smith
and
mr.
jones
and
so
on.
then,
they
prosecute
mr.
katz
and
mr.
katz
says,
i
want
all
of
the
bugging
records
not
just
the
bugging
records
related
to
me
but
i
want
them
all
even
if
mr.
williams
talked
to
his
lawyer
or
mr.
smith
talked
to
somebody
else.
i
want
them
all.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
now
--
alright.
now,
let's
take
a
look
at
this
carefully.
what
you're
doing
then
is
making
the
assertion
that
bugging
--
that
when
a
person's
office
i
suppose
or
his
home
is
bugged
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
total
fruits
of
that
bugging
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
whatever
--
what
--
whomever
it
may
involve
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
you
would
not
extend
that
outside
of
the
premises
in
which
the
person
has
an
occupancy
right,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
safeguard
whom
to
the
maximum?
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
court
could
put
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
under
an
order
not
to
disclose
the
contents
of
the
material
except
in
certain
circumstances?
is
that
kind
of
protective
order
you're
talking
about?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
he
wouldn't
trust
his
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
is
a
miscreant
eavesdropper
maybe
a
family
man
who
is
a
member
of
the
police
force,
is
that
--
are
we
talking
about
the
same
point?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
you
one
further
question
if
you
don't
mind?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
it's
a
hotel
room
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
it's
--
the
occupant
of
the
hotel
room
is
pretty
social
falling,
he
has
lots
of
people
in
from
time
to
time
whether
he
is
there
or
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
you
still
extend
it
depending
on
how
long
his
name
appears
on
the
register?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
--
suppose
mr.
x
has
rented
the
room,
but
suppose
mr.
y
has
been
in
there
a
great
deal
and
mr.
y
is
the
one
who
is
prosecuted
not
mr.
x
and
mr.
y
finds
out
the
room
has
been
bugged
and
so
some
conversations
of
interest
to
him
had
been
obtained.
what
would
be
your
standard
there?
justice
abe
fortas
does
not
rent
the
room,
he
is
just
--
justice
abe
fortas
only
while
he
is
in
the
room?
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
a
room
that
x
has
rented.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
williams,
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
but
do
i
take
it
by
our
reference
to
u.s.
against
kaplan
that
you
see
no
way
of
making
a
distinction
between
the
organized
crime
type
of
case
that
we
see
here
and
the
national
security
case?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
it
should
on
the
basis
of
what
you
have
said
in
those
--
justice
abe
fortas
to
extend
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
your
occupancy
theory,
you
could
certainly
turnover
to
a
story
book
kind
of
an
international
spy
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
material
that
he
wouldn't
otherwise
be
aware
of.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
if
you'd
tried,
you
could
imagine
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
not
quite
the
issue
is
it
mr.
williams
or
perhaps
i
misunderstand,
the
issue
is
how
shall
it
be
determined
whether
the
evidence
is
being
offered
or
fruits
of
the
unlawfully
obtained
evidence
is
being
offered,
perhaps
i
misunderstand
but
i
thought
the
government's
position
was
not
to
defend
the
use
of
such
evidence
but
that
the
government's
position
was
to
insist
that
whether
such
evidence
is
being
used
or
the
fruits
thereof
are
being
used
should
be
determined
by
the
judge
in
camera.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
subject
matter
of
the
conversation
that's
overheard?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he's
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you
don't
want
us
to
understand
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
category
as
--
category
as
precluding
your
from
suggesting
its
expansion
in
a
later
date
and
time?
justice
abe
fortas
first,
his
codefendant
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
wasn't
directed
against
him
but
it
was
directed
against
his
codefendant
and
you
say
that
he'd
still
be
entitled
to?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
thought
i
understood
the
problem
but
i'm
beginning
to
wonder
mr.
williams
called
our
attention
at
page
21
under
your
brief
in
the
alderman
case
and
i
read
that
first
paragraph
to
mean
us
this
that
the
alderman
or
alderisio,
"any
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
have
the
material
turnover
to
him
not
to
the
judge
if
one,
he
was
a
participant
in
the
conversations
that
were
overheard
or
two,
if
although
not
a
participant,
the
overhearing
occurred
in
premises
owned
by
him
or
in
which
he
had
some
other
interest
at
the
time."
i
understood
that
paragraph
to
mean
that
the
government
agreed
that
in
either
of
these
events
not
that
the
material
was
to
be
turned
over
to
the
judge
for
in
camera
examination
but
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
have
him
turned
over
to
him,
am
i
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
instance?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
instance
in
which
the
government
says
that
the
defendants
entitled
to
have
material
turned
over
to
him
instead
of
to
the
judge
for
in
camera
examination?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
forget
about
the
national
security.
justice
abe
fortas
the
question
is,
is
there
any
case,
forget
about
the
national
security,
any
other
case?
justice
abe
fortas
must
be
turned
over
to
the
defendant?
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
it
may,
regardless
of
what's
in
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
there
anything
else?
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
this
case,
in
the
ivanov
and
butenko
case,
you
are
proposing
that
the
material
be
submitted
to
the
judge
with
in
camera
inspection,
are
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
i
--
maybe
i
didn't
follow
you
and
justice
brennan
but
you
don't
object
to
submitting
it
to
the
judge
for
in
camera
inspection
issue
as
whether
it
should
be
turned
over
to
the
defendant
or
defendants
or
their
counsel
for
their
inspection
without
the
first
being
sifted
by
the
judge
to
determine
relevance.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
to
say
that
you
would
agree
that
the
transcript
of
such
conversation
should
be
turned
over
to
the
defendant?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
don't
--
do
you
read
mr.
williams'
brief
as
indicating
that
he
is
arguing
only
for
such
conversations?
justice
abe
fortas
not
quite
that
easy
is
it
mr.
williams
because
what
you're
talking
about
in
the
cases
before
us
at
least
one
aspect
of
them
relates
to
conversations
between
two
strangers,
let
us
say,
who
happen
to
be
on
the
premises
of
the
defendant
and
those
two
strangers
may
have
had
a
reasonable
expectation
that
their
conversation
would
be
private.
it
may
have
a
kind
of
an
interest
in
this
so
that
it's
much
more
complex
and
subtle
it
would
seem
to
me
then
the
case
where
the
government
unlawfully
seizes
letters
or
documents
belonging
to
the
defendant.
i
wonder
really
if
the
issue
between
you
and
me
and
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
relate
to
technique
what
is
the
proper
technique
casting
and
balance
between
what
would
seem
to
be
obviously
competing
values.
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
determining
whether
the
material
is
or
is
not
relevant
to
the
prosecution
for
the
defense.
justice
abe
fortas
guess
what,
in
our
sense
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here
as
one
of
those
protective
orders
of
the,
in
order
to
achieve
one
of
those
protective
orders
is
if
necessary
to
give
the
court
the
power
to
examine
the
logs
in
camera
and
to
suppressed
them
for
example
that
a
and
b
and
the
situations
that
you're
talking
about
that
you
put
not
to
the
defendant
if
they
--
and
they
were
talking
about
bumping
of
the
defendant,
i
think
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
kind
of
a
situation
that
people
think
about
in
connection
with
cases
of
these
types
and
shouldn't
there
be
some
mechanism
by
which
the
court
can
examine
that
log
in
camera
in
there
suppress
it.
justice
abe
fortas
and
maybe
that's
rare,
i
don't
know
enough
of
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
would
tremendously
expand
our
position
that
this
court's
taken
in
all
fourth
amendment
cases,
wouldn't
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry,
i
shouldn't
use
advert
but
it
would
mean
that
we're
announcing
you
fourth
amendment
doctrine
right
across
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
misunderstood
you
a
moment
ago.
did
you
really
say
that
any
person
against
whom
electronic
search
is
directed
has
standing?
do
you
take
the
position
as
broad
as
that?
that
is
to
say
that
if
there's
an
unlawful
electronic
surveillance
directed
against
a,
then
he
has
standing
even
though
he
maybe
a
total
stranger
to
the
conversations
and
to
the
premises
and
no
co-defendant
or
co-conspirator
is
involved.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
starting
one
more
ingredient
there
mr.
williams
which
says
that
if
he
is
the
subject
of
the
conversation
even
though
it's
between
total
strangers
then
he
is
entitled
to
disclosure.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
is
another
ingredient.
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
that
mean
in
practice
mr.
danzig?
does
that
mean
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
subpoena
the
agents
who
overheard
the
conversation?
you'd
be
entitled
to
subpoena
then,
won't
you
make
sure
that
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
records
were
complete
then
you've
been
able
to
--
would
you
be
entitled
what
you've
been
entitled
to
subpoena,
the
agents
who
investigated
the
case
generally
to
see
whether
they
utilized
then
of
that
information?
justice
abe
fortas
then
would
you
be
entitled
to
subpoena,
the
lawyers
whoever
it
was
who
put
the
case
together
for
presentation
of
a
grand
jury
to
see
whether
they
utilize
any
of
the
information.
justice
abe
fortas
you
make
no
distinction
between
national
security
cases
and
other
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
espionage
is
kind
of
--
espionage
on
behalf
of
foreign
power
which
is
alleged
to
view
the
case
here
is
kind
of
close
to
national
security.
justice
abe
fortas
the
reason
i
was
asking
these
questions
is
what's
going
on
in
my
mind
is
this
if
you
take
the
sweep
of
mr.
williams
was
talking
about
and
what
you're
talking
about
as
i
understand
that,
the
national
security
cases
doesn't
really
--
does
not
mean
that
wherever
there
has
been
any
electronic
espionage
over
a
vast
area
that
may
have
some
relationship
to
the
defendant
that
in
that
vast
area,
the
government
is
faced
with
the
choice
of
--
well,
the
government
really
has
to
dismiss
the
case
if
there
has
been
any
electronic
espionage
in
the
or
electronic
surveillance
in
this
vast
area
that
we
were
discussing
with
mr.
williams.
justice
abe
fortas
but
again,
that
is
not
the
issue
because
i
take
it
that
the
government
is
not
contending
for
the
right
to
use
evidence
obtained
by
electronic
surveillance.
the
question
is
what
should
be
the
mechanism?
what
should
be
the
mechanism
for
determining
whether
recorded
or
logged
information
obtained
by
electronic
surveillance
is
arguably
relevant
to
the
prosecution
or
the
defense
in
a
particular
case?
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
because
nobody
here
is
--
i
understand
that
nobody
here
has
argued.
in
this
case
anyway
--
in
these
cases
anyway,
that
even
in
national
defense
matters,
unlawfully
obtained
information,
information
obtained
as
a
result
of
unlawful
electronic
surveillance
should
be
admissible
in
evidence.
solicitor
general
says
you
may
want
to
argue
that
in
the
later
case
where
its
national
security
case
but
he's
not
arguing
it
now.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
between
the
government's
none
disclosure
and
the
trial
judges'
tendency
to
go
along
with
the
government
that
this
will
be
an
idle
ceremony.
justice
abe
fortas
but
will
--
you
don't
really
want
us
to
assume
that
the
government
is
going
to
do
something
like
that
and
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
be
as
(inaudible)
that
would
assume,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
so
they
--
if
that
is
so,
that
ought
to
end
it,
shouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
that
that
turns
out
to
be
the
fact
after
a
full
pledge
inquiry,
that
has
absolutely
nothing
that
is
arguably
relevant
to
the
prosecution
or
the
defense
of
the
matter
that
they
--
let's
take
a
ridiculous
illustration
that
they
did
but
the
premises
and
the
only
thing
that
they
got
was
some
conversation
about
the
weather
in
the
gulf,
that
suppose
it.
now
don't
you
think
that
that
ought
to
end
the
matter
in
the
sense
that
the
prosecution
goes
in?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
then
in
your
illustration
mr.
solicitor
general.
suppose
the
information
used
--
to
be
used
in
the
prosecution
of
the
americans
who
are
bringing
a
nuclear
ship
in
the
new
york
harbor,
i
assume
they
plan
to
get
out
before
the
nuclear
explosion
occur?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
the
agents
of
the
government
broke
into
their
office
and
took
without
a
warrant
or
probable
cause
or
anything
else
documents
were,
could
those
later
be
used?
would
your
argument,
those
will
be
used?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general,
does
the
--
your
proposal
for
handling
this
material
foreign
with
the
statements
in
the
court's
opinion
in
dennis
with
respect
to
procedure
there,
in
dennis,
as
appears
on
page
875,
the
court's
opinion
i
take
it
was
contemplated
that
the
grand
jury
transcript
might
be
handed
to
the
judge
in
camera
that
the
government
might
file
an
application
for
protective
orders
as
dennis
is
in
unusual
situations
such
as
those
involving
the
nation's
security
or
clear
cut
dangers
to
individuals
who
are
identified
by
the
testimony
produced.
now,
apart
from
the
specific
reasons
that
might
be
advance
to
justify
the
trial
judge
in
refusing
the
turn
over,
the
bugged
recording,
does
the
procedure
that
you
proposed
here
contemplate
that
the
trial
judge's
authority
to
refuse
to
turn
over
material
will
be
limited
to
case
where
application
is
made
by
the
government?
that
specific
parts
to
be
eliminated
and
presumably
that
application
would
be
served
on
the
other
side,
the
other
side
be
greater
in
handicapped
of
course
because
when
they
have
access
to
the
material,
but
that
would
at
least
preserved
the
substance
of
the
points
notify
the
other
side
that
some
material
is
being
withhold,
withheld
and
perhaps
in
general
the
nature,
the
reason
why
in
general
category
it's
being
withheld
and
would
also
preserve
the
matter
on
appeal.
now,
is
the
suggestion
that
you
make
here
differ,
does
the
suggestion
you
make
here
differ
from
that
one
that
i
believe
is
outlined
by
the
court's
opinion
in
dennis?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
also
a
very
important
question
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
it's
also
a
very
important
question
of
notice
and
whether
the
trial
judge
will
proceed
to
look
at
this
material
in
camera
and
then
only
the
government
will
know
that
he
has
cut
out
something
or
withheld
something
and
the
reason
for
him,
the
preservation
of
the
points
for
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
does
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
does
fall
short
of
the
procedure
outlined
by
this
court
in
dennis
with
respect
to
the
grand
jury
transcript.
justice
abe
fortas
and
why
would
you
exclude
the
requirement
for
an
application
so
that
the
other
side
will
at
least
have
notice
that
the
government
has
moved
that
section,
that
material
identified
by
pages
so
and
so
of
the
transcript
let's
say,
applications
made
into
the
court
to
withhold
that
material
for
national
security
reasons,
withhold
other
material
or
grounds
of
relevance.
why
would
you
object
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
that
but
go
ahead.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
put
the
defense
on
notice
so
that
if
they
chose
they
can
--
that's
--
material
has
been
excluded
and
in
general
on
the
basis
of
it
so
that
if
they
choose
they
can
ask
the
appellate
court
to
take
another
look
at
this
and
there
--
thereby
you
have
a
bit
of
supervision
--
justice
abe
fortas
over
the
trial
judge.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
that
is
part
of
your
proposal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
williams,
it's
in
a
little
more
complicated
and
subtle
in
that.
let's
suppose
you
have
a
katz's
type
of
situation
where
those
bugging
of
a
telephone
booth
to
get
information
on
mr.
katz,
and
let's
suppose,
i
don't
believe
this
happened
in
katz,
but
let's
suppose
that
in
the
course
of
that
they
picked
up
telephone
conversations
by
mr.
williams
and
mr.
smith
and
mr.
jones
and
so
on.
then,
they
prosecute
mr.
katz
and
mr.
katz
says,
i
want
all
of
the
bugging
records
not
just
the
bugging
records
related
to
me
but
i
want
them
all
even
if
mr.
williams
talked
to
his
lawyer
or
mr.
smith
talked
to
somebody
else.
i
want
them
all.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
now
--
alright.
now,
let's
take
a
look
at
this
carefully.
what
you're
doing
then
is
making
the
assertion
that
bugging
--
that
when
a
person's
office
i
suppose
or
his
home
is
bugged
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
total
fruits
of
that
bugging
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
whatever
--
what
--
whomever
it
may
involve
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
you
would
not
extend
that
outside
of
the
premises
in
which
the
person
has
an
occupancy
right,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
safeguard
whom
to
the
maximum?
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
court
could
put
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
under
an
order
not
to
disclose
the
contents
of
the
material
except
in
certain
circumstances?
is
that
kind
of
protective
order
you're
talking
about?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
he
wouldn't
trust
his
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
is
a
miscreant
eavesdropper
maybe
a
family
man
who
is
a
member
of
the
police
force,
is
that
--
are
we
talking
about
the
same
point?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
you
one
further
question
if
you
don't
mind?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
it's
a
hotel
room
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
it's
--
the
occupant
of
the
hotel
room
is
pretty
social
falling,
he
has
lots
of
people
in
from
time
to
time
whether
he
is
there
or
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
you
still
extend
it
depending
on
how
long
his
name
appears
on
the
register?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
--
suppose
mr.
x
has
rented
the
room,
but
suppose
mr.
y
has
been
in
there
a
great
deal
and
mr.
y
is
the
one
who
is
prosecuted
not
mr.
x
and
mr.
y
finds
out
the
room
has
been
bugged
and
so
some
conversations
of
interest
to
him
had
been
obtained.
what
would
be
your
standard
there?
justice
abe
fortas
does
not
rent
the
room,
he
is
just
--
justice
abe
fortas
only
while
he
is
in
the
room?
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
a
room
that
x
has
rented.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
williams,
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
but
do
i
take
it
by
our
reference
to
u.s.
against
kaplan
that
you
see
no
way
of
making
a
distinction
between
the
organized
crime
type
of
case
that
we
see
here
and
the
national
security
case?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
it
should
on
the
basis
of
what
you
have
said
in
those
--
justice
abe
fortas
to
extend
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
your
occupancy
theory,
you
could
certainly
turnover
to
a
story
book
kind
of
an
international
spy
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
material
that
he
wouldn't
otherwise
be
aware
of.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
if
you'd
tried,
you
could
imagine
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
not
quite
the
issue
is
it
mr.
williams
or
perhaps
i
misunderstand,
the
issue
is
how
shall
it
be
determined
whether
the
evidence
is
being
offered
or
fruits
of
the
unlawfully
obtained
evidence
is
being
offered,
perhaps
i
misunderstand
but
i
thought
the
government's
position
was
not
to
defend
the
use
of
such
evidence
but
that
the
government's
position
was
to
insist
that
whether
such
evidence
is
being
used
or
the
fruits
thereof
are
being
used
should
be
determined
by
the
judge
in
camera.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
subject
matter
of
the
conversation
that's
overheard?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he's
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you
don't
want
us
to
understand
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
category
as
--
category
as
precluding
your
from
suggesting
its
expansion
in
a
later
date
and
time?
justice
abe
fortas
first,
his
codefendant
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
wasn't
directed
against
him
but
it
was
directed
against
his
codefendant
and
you
say
that
he'd
still
be
entitled
to?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
thought
i
understood
the
problem
but
i'm
beginning
to
wonder
mr.
williams
called
our
attention
at
page
21
under
your
brief
in
the
alderman
case
and
i
read
that
first
paragraph
to
mean
us
this
that
the
alderman
or
alderisio,
"any
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
have
the
material
turnover
to
him
not
to
the
judge
if
one,
he
was
a
participant
in
the
conversations
that
were
overheard
or
two,
if
although
not
a
participant,
the
overhearing
occurred
in
premises
owned
by
him
or
in
which
he
had
some
other
interest
at
the
time."
i
understood
that
paragraph
to
mean
that
the
government
agreed
that
in
either
of
these
events
not
that
the
material
was
to
be
turned
over
to
the
judge
for
in
camera
examination
but
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
have
him
turned
over
to
him,
am
i
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
instance?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
instance
in
which
the
government
says
that
the
defendants
entitled
to
have
material
turned
over
to
him
instead
of
to
the
judge
for
in
camera
examination?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
forget
about
the
national
security.
justice
abe
fortas
the
question
is,
is
there
any
case,
forget
about
the
national
security,
any
other
case?
justice
abe
fortas
must
be
turned
over
to
the
defendant?
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
it
may,
regardless
of
what's
in
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
there
anything
else?
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
this
case,
in
the
ivanov
and
butenko
case,
you
are
proposing
that
the
material
be
submitted
to
the
judge
with
in
camera
inspection,
are
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
i
--
maybe
i
didn't
follow
you
and
justice
brennan
but
you
don't
object
to
submitting
it
to
the
judge
for
in
camera
inspection
issue
as
whether
it
should
be
turned
over
to
the
defendant
or
defendants
or
their
counsel
for
their
inspection
without
the
first
being
sifted
by
the
judge
to
determine
relevance.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
to
say
that
you
would
agree
that
the
transcript
of
such
conversation
should
be
turned
over
to
the
defendant?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
don't
--
do
you
read
mr.
williams'
brief
as
indicating
that
he
is
arguing
only
for
such
conversations?
justice
abe
fortas
not
quite
that
easy
is
it
mr.
williams
because
what
you're
talking
about
in
the
cases
before
us
at
least
one
aspect
of
them
relates
to
conversations
between
two
strangers,
let
us
say,
who
happen
to
be
on
the
premises
of
the
defendant
and
those
two
strangers
may
have
had
a
reasonable
expectation
that
their
conversation
would
be
private.
it
may
have
a
kind
of
an
interest
in
this
so
that
it's
much
more
complex
and
subtle
it
would
seem
to
me
then
the
case
where
the
government
unlawfully
seizes
letters
or
documents
belonging
to
the
defendant.
i
wonder
really
if
the
issue
between
you
and
me
and
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
relate
to
technique
what
is
the
proper
technique
casting
and
balance
between
what
would
seem
to
be
obviously
competing
values.
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
determining
whether
the
material
is
or
is
not
relevant
to
the
prosecution
for
the
defense.
justice
abe
fortas
guess
what,
in
our
sense
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here
as
one
of
those
protective
orders
of
the,
in
order
to
achieve
one
of
those
protective
orders
is
if
necessary
to
give
the
court
the
power
to
examine
the
logs
in
camera
and
to
suppressed
them
for
example
that
a
and
b
and
the
situations
that
you're
talking
about
that
you
put
not
to
the
defendant
if
they
--
and
they
were
talking
about
bumping
of
the
defendant,
i
think
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
kind
of
a
situation
that
people
think
about
in
connection
with
cases
of
these
types
and
shouldn't
there
be
some
mechanism
by
which
the
court
can
examine
that
log
in
camera
in
there
suppress
it.
justice
abe
fortas
and
maybe
that's
rare,
i
don't
know
enough
of
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
would
tremendously
expand
our
position
that
this
court's
taken
in
all
fourth
amendment
cases,
wouldn't
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry,
i
shouldn't
use
advert
but
it
would
mean
that
we're
announcing
you
fourth
amendment
doctrine
right
across
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
misunderstood
you
a
moment
ago.
did
you
really
say
that
any
person
against
whom
electronic
search
is
directed
has
standing?
do
you
take
the
position
as
broad
as
that?
that
is
to
say
that
if
there's
an
unlawful
electronic
surveillance
directed
against
a,
then
he
has
standing
even
though
he
maybe
a
total
stranger
to
the
conversations
and
to
the
premises
and
no
co-defendant
or
co-conspirator
is
involved.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
starting
one
more
ingredient
there
mr.
williams
which
says
that
if
he
is
the
subject
of
the
conversation
even
though
it's
between
total
strangers
then
he
is
entitled
to
disclosure.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
is
another
ingredient.
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
that
mean
in
practice
mr.
danzig?
does
that
mean
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
subpoena
the
agents
who
overheard
the
conversation?
you'd
be
entitled
to
subpoena
then,
won't
you
make
sure
that
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
records
were
complete
then
you've
been
able
to
--
would
you
be
entitled
what
you've
been
entitled
to
subpoena,
the
agents
who
investigated
the
case
generally
to
see
whether
they
utilized
then
of
that
information?
justice
abe
fortas
then
would
you
be
entitled
to
subpoena,
the
lawyers
whoever
it
was
who
put
the
case
together
for
presentation
of
a
grand
jury
to
see
whether
they
utilize
any
of
the
information.
justice
abe
fortas
you
make
no
distinction
between
national
security
cases
and
other
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
espionage
is
kind
of
--
espionage
on
behalf
of
foreign
power
which
is
alleged
to
view
the
case
here
is
kind
of
close
to
national
security.
justice
abe
fortas
the
reason
i
was
asking
these
questions
is
what's
going
on
in
my
mind
is
this
if
you
take
the
sweep
of
mr.
williams
was
talking
about
and
what
you're
talking
about
as
i
understand
that,
the
national
security
cases
doesn't
really
--
does
not
mean
that
wherever
there
has
been
any
electronic
espionage
over
a
vast
area
that
may
have
some
relationship
to
the
defendant
that
in
that
vast
area,
the
government
is
faced
with
the
choice
of
--
well,
the
government
really
has
to
dismiss
the
case
if
there
has
been
any
electronic
espionage
in
the
or
electronic
surveillance
in
this
vast
area
that
we
were
discussing
with
mr.
williams.
justice
abe
fortas
but
again,
that
is
not
the
issue
because
i
take
it
that
the
government
is
not
contending
for
the
right
to
use
evidence
obtained
by
electronic
surveillance.
the
question
is
what
should
be
the
mechanism?
what
should
be
the
mechanism
for
determining
whether
recorded
or
logged
information
obtained
by
electronic
surveillance
is
arguably
relevant
to
the
prosecution
or
the
defense
in
a
particular
case?
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
because
nobody
here
is
--
i
understand
that
nobody
here
has
argued.
in
this
case
anyway
--
in
these
cases
anyway,
that
even
in
national
defense
matters,
unlawfully
obtained
information,
information
obtained
as
a
result
of
unlawful
electronic
surveillance
should
be
admissible
in
evidence.
solicitor
general
says
you
may
want
to
argue
that
in
the
later
case
where
its
national
security
case
but
he's
not
arguing
it
now.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
between
the
government's
none
disclosure
and
the
trial
judges'
tendency
to
go
along
with
the
government
that
this
will
be
an
idle
ceremony.
justice
abe
fortas
but
will
--
you
don't
really
want
us
to
assume
that
the
government
is
going
to
do
something
like
that
and
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
be
as
(inaudible)
that
would
assume,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
so
they
--
if
that
is
so,
that
ought
to
end
it,
shouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
that
that
turns
out
to
be
the
fact
after
a
full
pledge
inquiry,
that
has
absolutely
nothing
that
is
arguably
relevant
to
the
prosecution
or
the
defense
of
the
matter
that
they
--
let's
take
a
ridiculous
illustration
that
they
did
but
the
premises
and
the
only
thing
that
they
got
was
some
conversation
about
the
weather
in
the
gulf,
that
suppose
it.
now
don't
you
think
that
that
ought
to
end
the
matter
in
the
sense
that
the
prosecution
goes
in?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
then
in
your
illustration
mr.
solicitor
general.
suppose
the
information
used
--
to
be
used
in
the
prosecution
of
the
americans
who
are
bringing
a
nuclear
ship
in
the
new
york
harbor,
i
assume
they
plan
to
get
out
before
the
nuclear
explosion
occur?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
the
agents
of
the
government
broke
into
their
office
and
took
without
a
warrant
or
probable
cause
or
anything
else
documents
were,
could
those
later
be
used?
would
your
argument,
those
will
be
used?
