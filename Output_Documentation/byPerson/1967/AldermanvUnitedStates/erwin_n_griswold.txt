mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
began
as
an
indictment
in
the
district
court
for
colorado
for
conspiracy
to
transmit
in
interstate
commerce
communications
containing
threats
designed
to
injure
one,
robert
sunshine.
there
were
then
four
defendants;
one
was
acquitted
and
of
course
is
not
here.
the
other
three
defendants
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
at
the
trial,
the
defendant
kolod
sought
to
introduce
evidence
about
an
illegal
surveillance
which
is
the
fancy
way
to
call
it,
bugging
is
the
other
way
it's
called
at
the
desert
inn
in
las
vegas,
nevada.
he
offered
this
in
rebuttal
in
order
he
said
to
disprove
or
offset
evidence
offered
by
the
government.
the
trial
court
examined
the
materials
in
camera
and
held
that
they
were
not
relevant
and
that
the
evidence
could
not
be
introduced.
the
three
defendants
who
were
convicted
appealed
to
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
pending
the
appeal,
the
government
disclosed
that
it
had
additional
files
relating
to
conversations
overheard
at
the
desert
inn.
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
examine
this
material
in
camera.
the
court
found
nothing
admissible
in
the
additional
material.
thereafter,
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
the
convictions.
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
here
and
was
denied
in
october
1967.
now
that
is
the
background.
before
going
further,
i
should
point
out
that
the
electronic
surveillance
material
examined
in
the
courts
below
related
to
the
defendant
kolod
and
the
premises
which
he
used
in
las
vegas,
nevada.
kolod
has
since
died
and
the
petition
as
to
him
has
been
dismissed
on
january
29th
of
this
year.consequently,
there
is
nothing
now
before
the
court
relating
to
the
electronic
surveillance
material
which
was
considered
by
the
courts
below.
we
now
have
wholly
new
problem.
at
the
post
trial
hearing
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
here,
counsel
for
alderisio,
another
--
the
defendants
stated
that
there
was
newly
discovered
evidence
of
a
wiretap
or
listening
device
used
against
his
client
in
chicago
between
october
1,
1960
and
december
31,
1962.?
the
nature
or
source
of
this
evidence
was
not
stated,
it
is
this
surveillance
in
chicago
relating
to
the
petitioner
alderisio
with
which
the
court
is
now
concern.
after
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
petitioners
sought
an
order
suspending
the
denial
of
certiorari
pending
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
a
rehearing.
mr.
spritzer,
the
acting
solicitor
general
made
a
typewritten
response
to
this
application.
thereafter,
the
petitioner
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
a
motion
for
the
disclosure
of
electronic
surveillance
and
this
is
the
matter
which
is
now
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
just
before
the
recess,
i
said
that
counsel
for
the
petitioners
had
filed
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
and
a
motion
for
the
disclosure
of
electronic
surveillance
and
that
that
was
where
we
were
now.
i
left
out
another
step
which
is
the
step
which
is
the
one
which
brings
us
here.
the
united
states
made
a
response
to
that
motion
and
the
court
then
on
january
29th,
entered
an
order
with
--
an
opinion
remanding
the
case
for
an
adversary
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
it
was
then
that
the
united
states
filed
the
motion
which
is
now
before
the
court.
this
is
entitled
a
motion
to
modify
the
order
of
the
court.
in
this
motion,
we
accept
without
a
question
of
any
sort
this
court's
decision
that
the
petitioners
here
are
entitled
to
the
independent
determination
of
a
court.
we
urged
however
that
this
should
be
done
in
the
first
instance
by
the
judge
in
camera
with
the
judge
then
being
free
to
order
such
further
proceedings
as
he
may
deem
necessary
or
appropriate
as
a
result
of
his
examination.
this
is
the
procedure,
we
would
point
out
which
was
followed
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
kolod
surveillance
in
las
vegas.
this
was
directly
approved
by
the
court
below
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
with
the
questions
specifically
raised
in
the
petition.
of
course
that
denial
is
in
no
sense
binding
on
the
court
but
i
do
mentioned
it
to
show
that
there
is
some
precedent
for
what
we
urged
and
similarly
the
seventh
circuit
as
recently
sustains
such
a
procedure
in
the
case
of
battaglia
against
united
states
which
was
decided
there
on
april
10th.
why
should
we
be
concerned?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
its
--
it
is
simply
cited
that
way
in
our
brief
mr.
justice,
battaglia
against
united
states
but
it
is
not
yet
in
any
--
in
the
federal
reporter.
i
have
a
copy
of
the
opinion
here
which
i
can
gladly
leave
with
the
clerk
if
that
would
be
helpful.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
why
should
be
we
concerned?
why
shouldn't
the
defendants
and
their
counsel
be
free
to
see
everything
and
make
what
they
can
of
it?
to
borrow
a
phrase,
the
automatic
knee-jerk
reaction
would
be
that
way.
the
question
is
whether
there
are
any
other
factors
in
the
situation
which
merit
further
consideration.
i'm
not
sure
that
there
are,
i
can
say
though
that
the
entire
problem
is
a
very
trouble
someone
and
is
full
of
difficulties.
various
aspects
of
it
have
been
before
the
court
in
seven
cases
which
have
been
disposed
of
and
there
are
now
six
cases
pending
before
the
court
in
which
it
is
involved
including
this
one.
for
the
possible
convenience
of
the
court,
these
have
all
been
lifted
--
listed
in
a
brief
memorandum
which
i
prepared
and
have
asked
the
clerk
to
make
available
to
the
court.
i
find
in
the
process,
i've
tried
to
put
together
a
complete
collection
of
all
of
the
papers
which
have
dealt
with
this
problem
and
they're
now
32
items
in
my
collection
and
it's
something
of
a
task
simply
to
keep
them
sorted
out
in
one's
mind.
the
problem
first
became
apparent
nearly
two
years
ago
in
the
case
of
black
against
the
united
states
where
after
the
denial
of
certiorari,
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
memorandum
in
may
1966
which
disclosed
electronic
surveillance.
in
response
to
instructions
from
the
court,
a
further
memorandum
was
filed
in
july
1966
going
in
to
considerable
detail
not
only
as
to
what
had
been
done
but
also
what
the
department
of
justice
was
doing
about
it.
the
court
then
vacated
the
conviction
of
black
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court.
in
that
case,
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
materials
were
relevant
and
the
sole
question
was
to
determine
whether
they
had
led
to
any
of
the
evidence
that
was
used
at
the
trial.
why
should
not
the
same
procedure
be
used
in
every
case?
perhaps
it
should.
this
is
not
an
area
where
there
are
any
clear
guides
either
of
principle
or
of
experience.
i've
worried
about
the
problem
almost
constantly
for
the
past
six
months.
as
a
result,
i
have
at
least
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
some
matters
which
are
worthy
of
consideration.
the
problem
of
relevance
of
the
material
is
one
you
can't
get
away
from.
one
might
say,
well,
you
bugged
him,
didn't
you?
you
admit
you
did,
why
don't
you
come
plea
and
give
him
the
material?
but
perhaps
it's
more
complicated
than
that.
seeing
the
fruits
of
bugging
as
a
new
experience
for
me,
it's
a
little
like
putting
a
live
television
camera
on
a
street
corner
all
sorts
of
things
happen,
most
of
it
is
very
dull,
some
of
the
rest
is
titillating
but
quite
irrelevant.
there's
an
almost
infinite
gradation.
let
us
suppose
that
a
microphone
is
put
in
a
room
which
picks
up
a
conference
between
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer.
of
course
this
should
be
disclosed
and
where
any
conversations
between
a
defendant
and
his
lawyer
have
appeared,
we
have
always
disclosed
this
since
the
problem
arose.
we
may
next
suppose
that
a
bug
is
put
in
a
room
of
defendant
a,
this
may
pick
up
conversations
of
a
and
these
may
or
may
not
have
any
conceivable
connection
with
a
criminal
prosecution.
a
may
discuss
a
contemplated
crime,
this
might
be
the
crime
for
which
he
is
being
prosecuted
or
some
other
unrelated
crime
or
a
may
discuss
a
trip
he
plans
to
take
with
another
man's
wife
intrastate
in
order
to
keep
it
from
being
federal.
moreover,
if
a's
premises
are
bugged,
particularly
office
or
business
premises,
conversations
of
many
persons
may
be
picked
up.
in
experience,
most
of
the
records
of
the
bugging
of
a's
premises
will
consist
of
conversations
of
other
persons
than
a
quite
often
without
a
being
present.
of
course
such
conversation
might
be
relevant
to
criminal
conduct
by
a
and
we
agree
that
a
judge
should
decide
that
question.
but
generally
they
will
not
though
they
may
involve
other
persons
often
in
highly
libelous
or
embarrassing
ways.
should
everything
be
disclosed
to
a
and
his
counsel
even
though
the
conversations
are
of
other
people
who
had
no
reason
to
expect
that
their
conversations
would
be
overheard.
there's
a
catch
overtone
in
this
problem
even
though
the
conversations
are
of
other
people
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
a's
activities.
perhaps
most
remote
is
the
situation
where
the
bug
is
put
on
b
unconnected
with
a.
but
a
wonders
into
the
picture.
a
comes
into
the
room
for
some
purpose,
perhaps
business,
perhaps
a
social
call,
perhaps
out
of
curiosity
or
by
mistake.
what
may
be
picked
up
from
a
may
be
relevant
but
does
this
mean
that
the
entire
record
should
be
made
available
for
a's
inspection.
in
an
underworld
atmosphere
which
is
sometimes
involved
in
this
cases,
there
maybe
wholly
irrelevant
things
said
by
other
persons
which
would
be
very
interesting
indeed
to
the
person
who
would
not
get
such
information
unless
there
had
been
illegal
activity
by
representatives
of
the
government.
should
all
of
these
be
made
available
to
a
merely
because
at
some
point
he
came
in
to
the
sound
tracking?
it's
bad
enough
that
there
was
such
illegal
activity
but
does
the
fact
there
was
illegal
activity
mean
that
its
fruits
must
be
broadcast
to
the
world.
as
happened
in
the
(inaudible)
case
in
boston
last
may
where
the
materials
became
an
exhibit
in
the
case
to
somebody's
carelessness,
i
don't
know
who,
it
was
not
sealed,
they
were
then
copied
by
the
press
in
the
clerk's
office
and
reproduced
with
big
headlines
by
many
newspapers.
it
said
that
this
can
be
safeguarded
against
by
proper
protective
orders
in
the
district
court.
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
this
has
not
worked
perfectly
in
practice
and
i
doubt
that
it
will
in
the
future.
in
any
event,
it
does
not
protect
third
persons
from
disclosure
to
the
defendant
himself.
and
that
may
in
some
cases
be
a
very
serious
matter.
suppose,
for
example,
that
in
the
bugging
of
a's
premises,
two
of
his
lieutenants
were
picked
up
in
his
absence
discussing
how
they
might
displaced
it.
thus,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
question
of
what
disclosure
the
government
makes
of
conversations
which
it
has
overheard,
involves
more
than
just
a
right
of
a
particular
defendant
before
the
court.
it
involves
the
right
of
each
of
the
participants
to
the
conversation.
we
believe
that
the
rights
of
these
other
participants
in
overheard
conversations
and
of
still
other
persons
to
whom
reference
is
made
in
conversations
are
also
entitled
to
protection
and
that
the
interest
these
individuals
have
in
keeping
the
conversations
private
will
often
militate
against
the
unnecessary
disclosure
of
the
conversations
to
the
defendant.
under
the
procedure
that
mr.
williams
proposes,
no
protection
would
be
given
to
the
interest
to
these
third
persons.
we
submit
that
by
giving
the
trial
judge
the
discretion
to
make
an
in
camera
examination
of
the
records
of
the
overhearing
some
degree
of
protection
can
be
provided
to
these
third
parties
since
records
of
their
conversation
would
only
be
disclosed
to
the
defendant
if
they
were
arguably
relevant
to
the
case
at
issue.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is,
it
is
however
to
coin
another
phrase,
a
condition
and
not
of
theory
that
we
are
confronted
with.
i
have
sometimes
felt
that
the
answer
is
that
we
should
gather
up
all
of
these
records
and
take
them
to
the
place
in
the
treasury
where
they
disposed
of
worn
out
paper
money
and
have
them
all
totally
destroyed,
macerated
i
think
is
the
term
with
appropriate
witnesses.
but
we
obviously
cant
do
that,
indeed
in
one
of
the
cases
now
pending
before
the
court,
mcgarry
against
the
united
states
number
1184,
we
are
in
trouble
because
something
like
that
did
happen.
the
records
there
were
destroyed,
i
think
without
any
evil
intent
but
the
fact
is
that
they're
gone
and
we
don't
--
we
can't
say
what
was
in
them.
my
observation
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
been
very
methodical
about
all
this.
their
records
have
been
well
and
carefully
kept.
one
can
find
out
where
a
bug
is
placed
and
the
dates
when
it
was
in
use.
there's
an
index
not
merely
of
the
person's
bug
but
a
person's
mentioned
in
the
interceptive
conversations.
however,
in
the
case
of
some
other
government
agencies,
the
records
are
more
scanted.
often
records
have
been
destroyed
and
indexing
is
less
than
satisfactory.
i
suppose
that
with
the
passage
of
time,
these
problems
will
fade
away.
but
for
the
time
being,
they
are
very
troublesome.
finally,
i
come
to
another
and
very
important
aspect
of
the
question.
it's
not
directly
involved
in
this
kolod
case
but
the
order
here
may
affect
it
and
it
cannot
be
overlooked.
the
question
is
involved
in
ivanov
against
the
united
states,
number
885
and
butenko
against
the
united
states
number
1007
miscellaneous
which
are
pending
before
the
court
on
petition
of
certiorari.
these
are
national
security
cases.
for
a
great
many
years,
electronic
surveillance
has
been
specifically
authorized
and
used
in
cases
involving
national
security
as
is
done
by
every
other
country
in
the
world.
we're
not
asking
the
court
in
this
case
to
pass
on
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
situations
where
the
surveillance
has
been
undertaken
in
order
to
protect
the
national
security
or
a
military
secret,
although
it
can
surely
be
argued
that
the
line
of
reasonableness
and
after
all
this
is
one
place
where
the
constitution
does
use
that
word.
what
it
prohibits
is
not
all
searches
and
seizures
but
on
reasonable
searches
and
seizures.
this
is
one
where
the
line
of
reasonableness
surely
varies
with
the
circumstances.
we
do
suggest
too
that
super
--
that
experience
supports
the
view
that
there
are
matters
which
a
nation
cannot
afford
to
overlook
in
its
own
self
protection.
where
the
persons
involved
have
diplomatic
status,
they
can
be
expelled.
why
are
we
concern
then?
well,
there
are
other
cases
of
which
ivanov
and
butenko
are
examples,
where
criminal
prosecution
is
appropriate.
if
there
has
been
electronic
surveillance,
we
in
the
department
of
justice
cannot
pass
on
its
relevance
ourselves.
we
accept
that
view
and
agree
with
it
but
we
think
that
question
of
relevance
in
such
cases
should
surely
be
first
determined
by
the
judge
in
camera
without
further
disclosure
unless
he
concludes
that
such
further
disclosure
is
necessary
or
appropriate.
i'm
advised
that
unless
disclosure
can
be
confined
to
in
camera
consideration
by
the
judge,
it
will
be
necessary
to
discontinue
prosecution
in
most
of
these
cases
involving
the
national
security,
for
the
disclosure
cannot
be
made
in
a
way
that
may
become
public
or
to
persons
who
are
agents
of
foreign
governments.
that
means
among
other
things
that
we
cannot
prosecute
even
though
the
surveillance
is
wholly
unrelated
to
the
prosecution.
if
we
do
not
prosecute,
we
cannot
vindicate
the
law
against
espionage
in
these
cases
as
in
ivanov
and
butenko.
in
that
event,
we
will
not
only
have
a
few
less
people
in
our
jails
but
also
fewer
people
to
trade
and
thus
more
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
release
of
americans
held
in
other
countries.
i
may
say
too
that
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
authority
to
suggest
that
there
could
be
disclosure
for
these
cases
even
to
judge
in
camera.
this
is
more
than
would
be
done
in
other
countries
and
perhaps
we
should
not
handicap
ourselves
too
much.
this
court
has
long
recognized
certain
special
powers
in
the
president
in
the
field
of
foreign
relations
and
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
army
and
navy.
the
zimmerman
note
and
the
breaking
of
the
purple
codes
are
important
events
in
our
history
and
they
were
both
done
by
interception.
it
is
said
that
when
secretary
simpson
was
secretary
of
state
in
the
early
1930's,
he
terminated
this
activity
and
in
state
department
saying
that,
gentleman,
don't
read
other
people's
mail
but
by
the
time
he
became
secretary
of
war
again
in
1941,
he
changed
his
view.
here,
there
are
constitutional
provisions
which
point
in
different
ways
and
the
procedure
i
suggest
may
be
a
way
of
harmonizing
them.
there
are
other
situations
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
where
the
district
judge
on
his
own
responsibility
and
without
a
formally
adversary
hearing
makes
determinations
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
this
has
recently
been
recognized
by
this
court
with
respect
to
prior
statements
of
witnesses
given
to
the
government
so
called
jencks
act
statement
and
also
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
government
witnesses
that's
involved
in
the
palermo
case
and
then
the
dennis
cases
both
rather
recently
decided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
a
question
of
words
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
think
mr.--
procedure
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
exactly
the
same
procedure
that
was
followed
in
this
kolod
case
in
the
district
court
in
two
places.
the
materials
are
made
available
to
the
district
judge,
the
other
side
is
advised
that
the
materials
are
made
available
to
the
district
judge
but
the
district
judge,
if
he
decides
that
they
are
not
relevant,
simply
advises
both
parties
that
the
materials
are
not
relevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
course
the
materials
are
then
preserved
under
seal
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
go
to
the
appellate
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
that
the
other
side
does
know
in
all
cases
about
the
fact
of
the
material.
the
government
has
disclosed
the
materials
in
these
cases.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
think
you're
quite
right
mr.
justice,
up
until
the
kolod
decision
unless
the
government
concluded
that
they
were
arguably
relevant
and
that
was
interpreted
very
broadly.
there
was
not
even
disclosure
that
is
correct.
under
the
court's
decision
in
kolod
which
we
accept,
we
would
now
disclose
everything
where
the
person
involved
is
mentioned
involved
in
anyway
but
we
would
submit
it
to
the
judge
to
decide
whether
there
was
anything
in
it
which
required
further
proceeding
of
any
kind.
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
how
you
can
specify
or
how
it's
very
useful
to
the
other
side
to
specify.
you
say
we
disclosed
so
many
logs
containing
so
many
pages
and
we
say
that
what's
on
pages
84
to
96
shouldn't
go
to
the
defendant.
he
doesn't
know
what
on
pages
84
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
should
certainly
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
have
that
right
and
they
would
know
in
all
of
these
cases
that
the
material
had
been
submitted
to
the
district
judge
and
that
he
had
excluded
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
certainly
part
of
our
position.
we
have
no
suggestion
that
this
be
done
secretly
by
the
district
court
in
the
sense
that
the
other
side
doesn't
know
that
it's
being
done.
we
do
think
that
the
district
judge
ought
to
do
it
without
disclosing
the
content
of
the
material
to
the
other
side.
we
submit
that
in
balancing
all
of
the
factors
in
this
difficult
situation,
the
sound
solution
is
to
provide
for
disclosure
to
the
district
judge
and
i
would
add
with
knowledge
to
the
other
side
that
this
is
been
done.
with
such
further
proceedings,
as
he
may
think
necessary
or
appropriate
and
for
this
reasons
we
submit
that
our
motion
to
modify
the
order
of
the
court
should
be
granted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
of
igor
a.
ivanov
who
with
john
william
butenko
was
indicted
in
the
district
of
new
jersey.
the
indictment
is
in
the
record
an
on
page
11,
the
grand
jury
charge
that
they
and
three
other
persons
did
unlawfully,
willfully,
and
knowingly
conspire
and
agree
to
communicate,
deliver,
and
transmit
to
a
foreign
government
which
is
named
and
the
representatives
and
agents
thereof
directly
and
indirectly,
information
relating
to
the
national
defense
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
particularly
information
relating
to
the
command
and
control
system
of
the
strategic
air
command
of
the
united
states
air
force
with
intent
and
reason
to
believe
that
the
said
information
would
be
use
to
the
advantage
of
a
foreign
nation
which
is
named.
the
other
three
persons
had
diplomatic
immunity
being
members
of
a
delegation
to
the
united
states;
ivanov
is
a
citizen
of
the
soviet
union.
he
was
an
employee
in
united
states
of
the
amtorg
trading
corporation,
as
such
did
not
have
a
diplomatic
community.
butenko
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
the
question
with
respect
to
him
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
that
with
respect
to
ivanov
is
involved
in
no.
197
which
is
the
next
case
on
the
argument
list.
the
problem
here
in
many
respects
is
similar
to
that
in
the
alderman
and
alderisio
cases.
most
of
mr.
williams
argument
in
this
case
was
in
fact
directed
to
the
issues
in
the
alderman
and
alderisio
case
with
respect
to
its
standing,
i
will
not
undertake
to
discuss
that
any
further
except
to
point
out
that
the
statement
that
the
overhearing
in
alderman
and
alderisio
was
on
alderisio's
business
premises
is
one
which
has
been
made
by
mr.
williams
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
preface
to
of
course
with
we
understand,
it
--
i
do
not
believe
it
can
be
found
in
any
paper
which
has
been
filed
by
the
government
except
one
file
by
mr.
sprecher
in
which
he
quoted
that
passage
from
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
government
affirm
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
government
did
not
assert
or
deny
with
respect
to
that,
it
did
admit
that
there
had
been
electronic
surveillance
and
in
its
brief
filed
in
this
court,
it
did
make
a
further
statement.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
position
of
the
government
today
is
what
is
stated
in
--
but
note
1
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
alderman
case,
we
are
advised
that
the
places
where
alderisio's
conversations
were
overheard
were
not
his
own
but
business
establishments
owned
by
associates
of
his
or
firms
that
employed
him
and
that
alderisio
himself
did
not
have
office
space
in
the
subject
premises.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
this
issue
was
never
been
considered
in
anyway,
shape
or
manner
by
the
court
below
in
this
case.
the
problem
with
respect
to
electronic
surveillance
of
alderisio
did
not
get
into
this
case
until
after
this
court
had
denied
certiorari.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
may
be
the
question
of
standing,
maybe
affected
by
that
but
still
to
be
our
position
that
even
though
it
is
found
that
alderisio
has
standing,
the
judge
ought
to
decide
in
camera
whether
the
material
is
relevant
in
any
way
here
for
the
reasons
developed
in
that
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
really
think
so
mr.
justice
but
if
he
has
no
standing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
would
be
the
only
thing
that
ought
to
be
considered.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
if
it's
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
his
home
or
even
at
his
business
premises
or
under
mancuso
at
a
place
where
he
has
a
regular
desk
space,
it
may
well
be
--
he
may
well
have
a
larger
place
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
he
may
have
standing
but
it
would
still
be
our
position
if
the
judge
ought
to
make
a
preliminary
determination
as
to
whether
the
material
has
any
conceivable
reference
to
the
particular
case,
particularly
as
it
involves
third
parties.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
there's
no
standing
on
the
tapes
never
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
correct.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
they
must
be
turned
over
to
the
judge.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
in
this
particular
case,
there
are
not
packing
cases
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
like
to
mr.
justice,
i
would
think
that
there
--
if
he
has
standing,
there
ought
them
to
be
turned
over
to
the
judge
any
records
of
conversations
in
which
he
was
a
party
on
either
side
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
myself
any
conversations
which
took
place
while
he
was
present
but
i
don't
know
of
any
authority
or
net
and
i'm
groping
on
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
turn
everything
that
--
everything
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly,
if
it
was
his
home.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
you're
wrong
mr.
justice
because
i
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
the
following
case
will
illustrate
that
to
some
extent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
certainly
not
in
the
national
security
case
which
is
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that's
--
but
that
is
the
reason
why
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
make
a
general
answer
to
your
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
have
taken
the
--
we
have
taken
the
position
that
any
conversation
between
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
must
be
turned
over
without
further
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
the
defendant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
it
was
fixing
a
go
off
date.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
any
conversation
we're
living
out
national
security
now
too
between
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
must
be
disclosed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
yes.
oh,
yes!
that's
the
objective
of
turning
it
over
to
the
trial
judge,
if
he
says
that
it
must
be
disclosed
under
these
conditions
or
various
circumstances,
we
undertake
to
be,
of
course
to
be
mummed
by
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
certainly
mr.
justice.
any
material
which
we
regard
as
relevant
has
as
a
matter
of
fact
over
the
past
three
years
been
turned
over
to
the
defense.
the
only
problem
arises
with
respect
the
material
which
it
has
contended
is
not
arguably
relevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
variations
and
the
facts
are
unlimited
and
it
will
probably
have
to
be
worked
out
in
the
jones
case,
the
defendant
had
small
interest
in
the
premises.
he
was
a
licensee
at
will
i
suppose
to
use
the
old
lingo.
he
was
a
guess
in
the
premises
but
he
was
there
at
the
time.
there
are
differences
between
his
owning
the
premises
if
the
premises
being
owned
by
someone
else
but
he
being
a
science
specific
space
in
them
which
is
his
as
a
right
for
the
time
being
and
others
who
are
yet
simply
guess
or
a
transient
in
the
premises.
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
lay
down
any
dogmatic
line
as
to
just
where
the
alliance
should
be
drawn.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
there
maybe
under
the
katz
case
if
b
and
c
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
a
has
--
even
though
a
has
consented
as
suggested.
even
thought
the
telephone
company
consented
in
the
katz
case,
i
don't
think
that
would've
made
any
difference.
i
think
that
b
and
c
have
to
have
such
relationship
to
the
premises
that
they
have
reason
to
think
that
their
conversation
there
is
private
and
not
being
disclosed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
answer
no
on
what
basis
b
and
c
are
in
the
premises.
did
a
tell
him
they
were
free
to
use
the
room
anytime
they
wanted
to?
did
he
invite
them
there?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
trying
to
interpret
to
katz
case
in
its
limitation
and
i'm
not
sure
just
what
difference
it
makes.
i
know
that
if
it's
a
telephone
booth,
they
have
a
right
to
expect
their
conversations
will
not
be
overheard.
i
wouldn't
have
supposed
that
the
katz
case
was
limited
to
telephone
booths.
we're
now
turning
to
the
ivanov
case.
incidentally,
there
is
an
aspect
with
respect
the
standing
that
i
can
make
here.
the
fact
is
that
ivanov
and
butenko
were
never
overheard
talking
together.
there
are
overhearings
of
ivanov
and
there
are
separate
overhearings
of
butenko,
and
i
supposed
that
an
argument
could
be
made
that
butenko
has
no
standing
to
object
with
respect
to
the
overhearings
of
ivanov
and
vice
versa.
however,
in
none
of
these
cases
did
the
overhearing
have
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
evidence
which
was
actually
produced
at
the
trial.
it
is
totally
irrelevant
to
that
and
the
problem
which
i
am
concerned
here
is
the
appropriate
protection
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
in
carrying
out
the
president's
responsibility
to
conduct
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
and
his
responsibility
as
commander-in-chief
of
the
army
and
navy.
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
what
was
done
here
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
because
the
fourth
amendment
forbids
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
in
those
words.
and
the
question
as
to
what
is
reasonable
obviously
varies
with
the
circumstances.
but
we
are
not
making
any
contention
and
there
is
not
involved
in
this
case
any
question
of
the
admission
of
evidence
which
was
obtained
by
a
reason
of
electronic
surveillance
and
we
are
contending
that
there
was
no
evidence
admitted
in
this
case
which
is
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
which
was
derived
from
an
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
williams
has
argued
very
eloquently
that
in
a
free
country
that
the
executive
ought
to
be
free
to
do
this
but
then
it
ought
to
be
put
to
its
choice
either
to
disclose
or
to
abandon
the
prosecution.
now
actually
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
kaplan
case,
the
prosecution
was
abandoned
and
mr.
williams
said
that
was
the
only
one
in
all
the
year
since
what
in
the
brief
for
butenko
on
page
27.
there
are
cited
two
other
cases,
united
states
against
egorov
and
united
states
against
sokolov
where
cases
were
dismissed
"in
the
interest
of
national
security"
and
there
had
been
other
cases
which
have
not
been
brought
because
the
evidence
was
in
fact
obtained
through
illegal
surveillance
and
the
officers
of
the
government
felt
that
they
could
not
appropriately
proceed
in
those
cases.
but
here
we
have
a
united
states
citizen
and
a
russian
citizen
not
entitled
to
diplomatic
immunity
and
we
have
a
situation
where
disclosure
has
been
made
that
there
was
electronic
surveillance
and
the
suggestion
is
made
that
that
electronic
surveillance
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
anything
which
has
a
period
in
the
prosecution
and
it
is
our
position
and
i
think
i
should
be
frank
to
say
that
this
is
the
case
in
which
we
are
concerned
not
to
alderman
and
alderisio,
we
can
live
with
that
of
course.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
yes,
mr.
justice
exactly,
and
the
whole
relation
of
the
executive
power
here
and
the
whole
question
of
the
balance
which
it
seems
to
me
is
clear
and
important.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
after
it,
i
don't
know
of
any
other
way
that
would
be
that
is
the
--
that
he
is
the
person
who
appeared
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
the
question
would
undoubtedly
be
considered
by
appropriate
officers
in
the
department
but
the
person
who
normally
appeared
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
leaves
the
impression
that
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
is
acting
on
his
own
as
an
independent
man
often
in
provinces,
some
place
and
maybe
he
will
and
maybe
he
won't.
actually,
these
matters
are
very
closely
watched
by
senior
officers
in
the
department
of
justice
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
acts
on
instructions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
that
is,
that
is
exactly
our
position
here.
i
may
say
i
had
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
getting
it
established
that
we
could
take
that
position
here.
the
view
which
would
be
taken
in
a
case
of
this
sort
in
any
other
country
i
know
of
is
that
neither
this
court
nor
anyone
else
would've
ever
heard
anything
about
it.
we
have
not
taken
that
position,
we
have
made
disclosure
that
there
was
electronic
surveillance
following
the
order
in
the
kolod
case.
we
have
sought
to
get
that
order
modified
so
that
though
there
will
be
disclosure
it
will
be
disclosure
to
the
district
judge.
now,
here
all
the
protective
orders
that
mr.
williams
can
divide
will
not
help
because
if
it
is
disclose
to
counsel
and
the
parties,
it
is
disclose
to
a
man
who
had
a
direct
contact
with
the
place
where
it
is
not
desirable
in
the
national
interest
that
there
be
disclosure.
moreover
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
we
--
our
position
would
be
the
same
whether
it
did
or
not.
we
are
not
arguing
here
that
it
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
we
are
suggesting
that
there
is
round
on
which
it
could
be
argued
and
there
may
be
some
future
day
when
another
ex
parte
quirin
comes
along
where
it
may
develop
that
evidence
was
obtained
against
german
saboteurs
who
landed
on
our
shore
by
wiretapping
and
electronic
surveillance
and
that
that
was
the
evidence
which
there
was
and
which
the
government
chose
to
produce
and
i
frankly
would
like
not
to
foreclose
the
decision
which
might
be
made
in
such
case
in
time
of
war.
in
this
case,
we
are
not
contending
that
any
evidence
so
obtain
was
admissible.
we
are
only
contending
that
when
the
position
is
that
the
electronics
surveillance
did
not
in
anyway
lead
to
the
evidence
which
was
used
in
the
court
that
the
decision
of
that
question
should
be
made
by
the
district
judge
in
camera
without
disclosure
to
the
parties
or
the
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
still
mr.
justice
would
like
to
reserve
at
sometime
the
right
to
argue
that
there
has
not
been
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
but
we
are
conceding
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
this
was
taken
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
here
and
in
the
district
court,
we
are
conceding
that
this
is
in
violation
or
this
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
want
to
reserve
it
for
another
case
at
another
time
under
different
circumstances
involving
the
national
security.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
turns
up
in
these
cases
involving
national
security
is
that
people
just
wonder
in
to
the
surveillance.
let
us
suppose
that
the
government
has
duly
authorized
the
attorney
general
to
--
duly
authorize
by
the
attorney
general
has
entered
into
a
surveillance
directly
connected
with
the
national
security.
no
one
can
question
under
this
case
it
is
directly
connected
with
the
national
security.
supposed
that
the
record
reads
like
this;
a
person
answers
the
telephone
and
says
"hello,"
the
other
party
says,
"this
is
john
brown,
i
want
talk
with
joe."
the
response
is,
"joe
who?"
the
calling
party
says,
"why,
joe
smith
of
course,"
to
which
the
response
is,
"there
is
no
joe
smith
here,
you
must
have
the
wrong
number,"
and
he
hangs
up.
two
years
later,
an
indictment
is
found
against
john
brown
for
failure
to
report
for
induction
under
the
draft.
now,
the
crime
of
failing
to
report
for
induction
under
the
draft
is
done
publicly.
it's
in
a
place
where
many
people
are
present
and
the
person
simply
does
not
respond
to
the
call.
there
is
no
way
that
electronic
surveillance
can
lead
to
evidence
of
that
essentially
undisputed
fact.
in
due
course
however,
the
government
finds
that
a
conversation
of
john
brown
has
been
intercepted
in
connection
with
surveillance
activities.
well,
the
government
feels
obligated
to
disclose
this
fact
to
the
court
despite
the
fact
that
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
conversation
has
utterly
no
relevance
with
respect
to
our
connection
with
the
graft
prosecution.
yet,
to
disclose
the
conversation
to
the
defendant,
we
disclose
the
place,
time,
method,
and
object
of
the
surveillance,
the
disclosure
i
am
advised
but
simply
cannot
be
made
in
many
cases
of
this
type.
i
would
point
out
that
in
mr.
williams'
brief
in
this
case
according
from
a
transcript
made
in
another
case,
the
name
of
a
foreign
country
is
placed
in
print,
not
disposed
i
may
say
by
the
government
representative
in
that
case
but
by
the
court.
we've
accepted
the
fact
that
we
can't
make
this
determination
for
ourselves.
even
in
the
clearance
cases,
although
that's
undoubtedly
what
would
be
done
virtually
every
other
country
in
the
world.
we
do
submit
though
that
we've
met
our
responsibilities
and
that
the
competing
and
factors
involved
are
adequately
balanced
if
we
make
the
disclosure
to
the
judge.
if
he
determines
that
the
material
is
irrelevant,
no
further
disclosure
would
be
made
and
the
material
disclosed
to
him
would
be
sealed
to
be
made
available
to
the
appellate
court
for
review.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
determines
that
the
material
could
be
relevant.
note,
i
didn't
say
"is
relevant,"
but
"could
be
relevant,"
then
the
government
will
have
to
decide
in
such
a
case
whether
to
make
the
disclosure
to
the
defendant
in
this
counsel
or
as
is
more
likely
to
be
the
situation
for
national
securities
involved
to
dismiss
the
prosecution.
thirty
years
ago,
i
am
told
that
when
mr.
simpson,
oh
my,
it's
nearly
40
years
ago
became
secretary
of
state,
he
terminated
the
activities
in
the
state
department
by
which
there
was
surveillance
of
foreign
activities
saying
that
gentlemen
do
not
open
other
people's
mail.
but
in
1940,
under
different
conditions
and
under
president
roosevelt,
that
rule
has
been
changed.
i
would
hope
that
we
would
not
get
into
a
situation
where
the
united
states
has
its
arm
tied
behind
his
back
in
the
way
that
no
other
nation
has
and
i
think
that
the
interest
of
the
government
can
be
adequately
protected
and
the
interest
of
the
defendant
by
providing
for
disclosure
to
the
trial
court
in
cases
of
this
sort.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
give
you
speaking
in
constitutional
terms;
i
would
rely
on
the
power
of
the
president
to
carry
on
foreign
relations
and
the
power
and
responsibility
of
the
president
as
commander-in
chief
of
the
army
and
navy.
and
there
are
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
recognized
the
importance
of
these
powers
and
which
have
set
that
the
--
well,
for
example
in
kennedy
against
mendoza
martinez,
while
the
constitution
protects
against
invasions
of
individual
rights,
it
is
not
a
suicide
pact.
and
similarly
in
the
chicago
and
the
southern
airlines
case,
the
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
president,
both
as
commander-in-chief
and
as
the
nation's
organ
for
foreign
affairs,
has
available
intelligence
services
who's
reports
are
not
and
ought
not
to
be
published
to
the
world
and
it
is
because
of
these
powers
expressly
granted
by
the
constitution
which
in
my
submission
must
be
interpreted
together
with
the
fourth
amendment
which
does
not
forbid
all
searches
and
seizures
but
forbids
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
that
i
would
argue
that
in
this
case
where
we
are
not
seeking
to
bring
the
material
in
the
evidence
but
are
seeking
merely
to
show
that
it
has
no
conceivable
relationship
to
the
prosecution
that
the
determination
by
that
fact
by
the
independent
district
judge
adequately
protects
the
interest
of
the
defendant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
by
its
very
nature,
the
protective
order
cannot
protect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
a
substantial
part
of
the
distinction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
its
very
difficult
to
draw
the
line,
that
is
a
question
of
balance
in
this
case
when
the
materials
are
seen
by
the
district
judge,
it
will
be
perfectly
apparent
that
it
bears
no
relation
whatever
to
the
prosecution
when
the
alternative
is
that
it
either
must
be
disclose
in
effect
directly
to
the
foreign
nation
or
that
the
prosecution
must
be
dismissed.
it
seems
to
me
appropriate
to
draw
the
line
at
the
place
which
says
that
there
need
to
be
further
disclosure
when
there
has
been
an
independent
determination
by
the
district
judge
of
the
question
of
conceivable
relevance
particularly
when
that
type
of
question
of
relevance
is
one
which
judges
habitually
make
and
which
they
do
make
in
a
number
of
other
situations
which
though
not
the
same
of
course
are
analogous
to
this
such
as
those
under
the
jenks
act
with
respect
to
the
disclosure
of
grand
jury
minutes
discovery
of
evidence
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
that
say
again
a
difficult
question,
one
might
think
and
in
many
situations
one
could
say
that
it
should
be
before
the
trial.
on
the
other
hand
at
that
point,
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
judge
to
have
many
ideas
as
to
whether
the
material
is
relevant
to
what
will
be
brought
out
at
trial.
in
most
cases,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
best
to
have
the
disclosure
made
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
at
which
time
the
judge
knows
what
the
evidence
was
and
has
some
basis
for
determining
whether
it
had
any
source
in
the
material.
that
has
two
effects,
one
of
which
is
that
if
the
judge
decides
that
the
evidence
was
stated,
then
there
must
be
a
new
trial
but
the
other
is
that
because
of
that,
the
government
prosecutor
is
going
to
be
extremely
careful
to
see
that
he
does
not
introduce
evidence
which
can
be
regarded
as
tainted
because
he
does
not
want
to
go
through
the
process
of
having
a
trial
and
then
having
it
set
aside.
in
most
cases
therefore
it
would
be
my
view
that
as
in
this
case,
it
is
wiser,
better
judicial
administration
to
have
the
disclosure
made
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
rather
than
beforehand.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
so
mr.
justice
but
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
in
the
aggregate
can
be
a
very
serious
matter
--
in
the
national
security
area.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
reason
for
not
disclosing
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
is
a
very
considerable
harm.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
this
case
is
here
on
reargument
having
been
previously
presented
to
the
court
last
may
on
a
motion
made
by
the
government
to
modify
and
order
of
the
court
which
the
court
entered
in
january
of
this
year.
the
case
began
as
an
indictment
for
conspiracy
to
transmit
in
interstate
commerce
communications
contending
threats
and
design
to
injured
one
robert
sunshine
of
denver,
colorado.
there
were
originally
four
defendants,
one
was
acquitted
and
is
not
here.
the
other
three
defendants
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
one
of
them,
a
man
name
kolod
has
since
died
and
so
the
case
now
involves
the
two
messrs.
alderman
and
alderisio.
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
defendant
kolod
who
is
no
longer
here
sought
to
introduce
evidence
about
illegal
surveillance
at
the
dessert
inn
in
las
vegas,
nevada.
the
materials
were
submitted
to
the
trial
court
in
camera
and
it
was
held
that
they
were
not
relevant
and
that
evidence
with
respect
to
them
could
not
be
introduced.
thereafter,
while
the
case
was
pending
before
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
government
disclosed
that
it
had
additional
files
relating
to
conversations
overheard
at
the
dessert
inn.
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
examine
this
material
in
camera
and
that
court
found
nothing
admissible
in
the
additional
material.
thereafter,
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
the
convictions;
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
here
and
was
denied
in
october
1967.
now
i
should
make
it
plain
that
these
earlier
disclosures
of
surveillance
material
are
not
now
involved
since
kolod
has
died
and
they
related
only
to
him.
there's
nothing
now
before
the
court
relating
to
the
electronic
surveillance
material
which
was
considered
by
the
courts'
below.
we
now
have
a
wholly
new
problem,
i
mentioned
that
background
partly
to
avoid
misunderstanding
and
partly
because
that
issue
whether
consideration
by
the
court
in
camera
was
the
issue
which
was
presented
by
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
this
court
denied
in
october
1967.
following
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
a
counsel
for
alderman
and
alderisio
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
which
they
asserted
that
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
additional
surveillance
involving
the
defendant
alderisio.
in
response
to
that,
mr.
sprecher
then
acting
solicitor
general
filed
a
paper
with
the
court
in
which
he
said
that
pursuant
to
the
government's
policy,
it
had
been
determined
that
there
was
nothing
which
was
arguably
relevant
with
respect
to
the
prosecution.the
court
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
so
understood
it
and
the
fact
that
there
was
additional
surveillance.
i'm
trying
to
develop
the
chronology
by
which
the
case
came
along
and
mr.
sprecher's
statement
simply
was
that,
"the
department
had
determined
that
there
was
nothing
which
was
arguably
relevant."
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
that
the
court
entered
its
order
in
january
of
this
year
remanding
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
an
adversary
hearing
and
the
government
by
that
time
had
conceded
that
there
were
additional
results
of
electronic
surveillance.
it
was
following
that
order
of
the
court
that
the
present
motion
was
filed
which
is
a
motion
to
modify
the
order
of
the
court.
in
that
motion,
we
accept
without
question
of
any
sort
of
this
court's
decision
that
the
petitioners
here
are
entitled
to
the
independent
determination
of
a
court.
we
urge
however
that
this
should
be
done
in
the
first
instance
by
the
judge
in
camera
with
the
judge
then
being
created
to
order
such
further
proceedings
as
he
maybe
necessary
or
appropriate
as
a
result
of
his
examination.
this
is
the
procedure
i
would
point
out
which
was
followed
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
kolod's
surveillance
at
las
vegas.
this
was
directly
approved
by
the
court
below
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
similarly,
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
batalla
case
which
is
now
pending
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
has
sustained
such
a
procedure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
distress
myself,
all
i
can
say
is
that
at
anytime
when
it
is
become
known
to
me
that
there
has
been
such
an
action
prompt
disclosure
has
been
made.
this
is
a
problem
which
was
brewing
for
a
long
time.
we
--
there
are
clear
orders
of
the
attorney
general
effective
in
1965
that
it
should
not
be
done
except
in
national
security
matters
which
is
a
question
involved
in
the
next
two
cases
that's
not
involved
here.
there's
no
question
of
national
security
in
the
alderman
and
alderisio
cases.
i
have
found
nothing
in
my
tenure
in
the
department
of
justice
to
indicate
that
that
order
of
1965
has
there
been
in
anyway
violated
and
i
am
hoping
that
we
are
slowly
beginning
to
get
to
the
place
where
this
will
receive
into
the
background.
it
first
became
apparent
in
this
court
something
over
two
years
ago
in
the
case
of
black
against
the
united
states
where
the
then
solicitor
general
filed
a
memorandum
which
disclosed
electronic
surveillance.
at
that
time,
the
attorney
general
established
a
committee
in
the
department
of
justice
to
review
every
case
where
it
was
found
and
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
there
was
anything
which
was
arguably
irrelevant
and
to
make
disclosure
in
cases
where
there
was
anything
arguably
relevant.
this
is
the
procedure
which
the
court
has
found
to
be
inadequate
that
the
department
cannot
itself
make
that
determination
and
this
we
accept
without
question.
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
disclosure
must
be
made
either
in
public
or
to
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
under
protective
orders
or
whether
it
is
appropriate
in
these
cases
to
make
disclosure
first
into
the
district
judge.
now,
i
find
myself
with
some
feeling
that
we
have
made
this
matter
more
difficult
than
it
need
to
be.
i
don't
want
to
minimize
the
difficulties
this
has
been
a
very
worrisome
problem
for
a
long
time.
but
actually
there
a
sizeable
number
situations
where
the
procedure
is
established
that
determinations
of
relevance
may
be
made
by
the
district
judge
in
camera.
one
which
goes
back
quite
long
ways
is
the
materials
which
need
to
be
disclosed
in
response
to
a
subpoena
duces
tecum,
a
party
may
be
a
little
concerned
taking
that
certain
items
are
not
covered
by
the
subpoena
but
not
wanting
to
be
in
contempt
of
court
in
having
it
found
out
later
that
he
didn't
turned
into
something
which
turned
out
to
be
irrelevant
and
it
has
long
been
the
practice
that
in
such
a
case,
the
party
may
submit
an
item
to
the
court
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
it
is
within
the
scope
of
the
subpoena.
in
the
areas
of
discovery
under
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
this
court
has
specifically
authorized
a
procedure
under
which
the
material
is
shown
to
the
district
judge
in-camera
and
the
judge
determines
whether
it
is
irrelevant
or
not.
there
is
a
case
in
which
the
government
will
file
a
brief
in
opposition
today,
i
hope
that
i
would
have
the
printed
brief
here
now
but
the
government
printing
officer
has
not
delivered
it.
i've
just
made
a
proof
of
it
available
to
mr.
williams
and
it's
only
illustrated
but
it's
not
a
major
matter
but
it
was
a
case
involving
a
bank
robbery,
the
counsel
for
he
defendant
proceeding
under
the
brainy
decision
of
this
court
which
holds
that
exculpatory
material
held
by
the
government
must
be
disclosed
to
the
defense.
the
government
turned
over
a
substantial
amount
of
material
to
the
court
stating
in
its
belief
much
of
it
was
not
relevant
to
this
matter.
the
court
examined
it
and
turned
part
of
it
over
to
the
defense
and
refused
to
turn
over
the
other
parts
saying
that
they
were
no
way
relevant
and
the
identity
of
the
persons
whom
the
government
had
interviewed
should
not
be
disclosed
to
the
defense.
we
are
there
filing
our
brief
in
opposition
in
support
of
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
which
says
that
that
is
an
appropriate
procedure.
similarly,
under
the
jenks
statute,
it
is
specifically
provided
that
the
united
states
shall
deliver
it
by
the
statute
to
deliver
and
shall
deliver
a
statement
for
the
inspection
of
the
court
in
camera
and
upon
such
delivery,
the
court
shall
excise
the
portions
of
such
statement
which
do
not
relate
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
testimony
of
the
witness
and
deliver
the
balance
to
the
defense.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
there's
probably
some
distinction.
i'm
not
trying
to
suggest
that
any
of
these
are
conclusive,
i
am
trying
to
say
that
there
are
a
number
of
situations
where
the
determination
is
made
by
the
judge
in
camera
without
an
adversary
proceeding
and
i
think
that
there
are
arguments
which
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
that
should
be
the
procedure
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
i
don't
believe
there
is
in
any
of
them.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
issue
in
those
particular
cases
with
respect
to
the
protection
of
third
parties
as
there
is
in
the
fourth
of
these
that
i
was
going
to
present
which
is
the
matter
of
testimony
before
grand
juries
which
in
some
ways
has
a
good
deal
of
parallel
with
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
we
get
to
the
problem
of
standing
to
which
i'm
going
to
turn
in
a
moment,
the
court
may
say
that
the
person
who
is
seeking
to
have
this
material
suppressed
has
no
standing,
it
is
so.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
which
case
it
will
not
be
turned
back
but
the
matter
of
access
to
grand
jury
testimony
has
a
mild
parallel
with
what's
involved
here,
then
the
rule
was
for
a
long,
long
time
that
there
could
be
no
access
to
grand
jury
testimony.
it
was
secret.
proceedings
of
grand
juries
were
secret.
the
court
has
broken
that
down
in
the
dennis
case
and
in
other
decisions
but
in
the
process,
it
recognized
that
it
was
not
appropriate
simply
to
turnover
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
to
the
defendant.
the
court
has
explicitly
decided
that
the
district
judge
should
examine
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
and
should
not
turnover
evidence
which
is
not
--
should
not
turn
over
a
testimony
in
the
minutes
which
is
not
relevant
to
the
particular
issue
with
which
the
defense
is
concerned
at
the
time
and
has
specifically
referred
to
the
fact
of
the
necessity
of
protecting
not
only
other
witnesses
but
also
third
parties
whose
names
might
have
been
mentioned
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings
but
who
perhaps
were
not
indicted
for
one
reason
or
another
and
that
is
done
by
the
judge
ex
parte.
now,
it
also
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
we
have
considered
this
problem
in
two
broad
a
way
and
in
that
respect,
i
found
some
passages
in
mr.
williams'
brief
which
seem
to
me
to
be
quite
relevant.
on
page
five
of
his
brief,
he
says
if
the
fbi
had
ransack
petitioner's
alderisio's
home
and
taken
his
private
papers
without
warrant
or
other
process
could
it
decline
to
produce
them
in
court.
well,
that
has
seems
to
narrow
the
contention
to
his
which
would
be
specifically
alderisio's
own
conversations
and
if
we
narrow
this
proceeding
simply
to
those
portions
of
transcripts
which
contained
conversations
to
which
alderisio
was
a
party
on
one
side
or
another.
we
have
already
excluded
a
considerable
part
of
the
material.
and
then
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
am
saying
that
if
we
--
i'm
trying
to
narrow
the
issue
to
that.
i
would
still
like
to
have
some
ground
to
stand
on
to
say
that
even
in
such
cases
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
judge
to
say
that
it
is
irrelevant.
but
if
the
contention
is
limited
simply
to
alderisio's
own
conversations,
the
problem
is
a
good
deal
easier.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
regard
it
as
bound
by
that
statement.
i
just
notice
that
as
i
was
reading
it.
there
are
other
passages
to
which
i
refer
which
seem
to
me
to
be
parallel
with
that.
similarly
on
page
16
and
17
of
his
brief,
he
refers
to
the
proceedings
in
the
local
court,
i
believe
in
the
black
case
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
16
on
top
of
page
17,
he
says,
"based
upon
further
proving
and
further
argument,
the
court
made
some
limited
excisions
with
principally
of
material
in
the
airtel
memorandum
which
had
which
had
a
live
informant
source."
now,
i
would
simply
point
out
that
in
that
case,
some
part
of
it
has
been
held
to
be
irrelevant
then
i
don't
regard
that
as
a
great
importance
but
on
page
22
of
his
brief,
the
last
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
errant
gossip
rationale
is
quickly
disposed
of
if
we
consider
that
the
petitioners
themselves
either
heard
or
made
the
scandalous
references
to
third
parties
other
while
they
were
present.
now,
that
seems
to
narrow
the
contention
to
conversations
of
which
the
defendants
here
were
parties
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
this
gets
me
to
the
issue
of
standing
which
was
raised
in
the
orders
setting
the
case
down
for
rehearing.
that
problem
presents
some
difficulties
and
embarrassments
for
counsel
who
are
representing
the
government
and
cases
of
this
sort.
i
think
the
difficulty
and
embarrassment
of
mr.
alexander
who
was
appearing
in
the
district
court
here
are
apparent
on
pages
14
and
15,
the
problem
is
that
if
you
could
only
disclose
this
material,
you
could
show
how
utterly
irrelevant
it
is.
but
if
you
disclosed
it,
you
have
defeated
the
whole
objective
of
trying
not
to
disclose
it.
now,
i
think
it
can
be
said
that
we
have
made
rightly
or
wrongly
a
sort
of
a
compromise
in
this
case.
we
have
made
what
amounts
to
a
partial
disclosure.
i
had
a
good
deal
of
concern
before
we
went
that
far
but
i
thought
we
had
to.
in
the
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
of
our
brief,
we
have
stated
our
understanding
of
the
situation
here
which
is
one
that
there
were
no
overhearings
whatever
of
mr.
alderman.
there
is
no
information
with
respect
to
mr.
alderman
and
that
with
respect
to
mr.
alderisio
we
have
in
effect
disclosed
the
places
where
the
overhearing
was.
they
were
overheard
on
premises
which
were
not
his
but
were
business
establishments
owned
by
associates
of
his
or
firms
that
employed
him
and
where
he
did
not
have
desk
space.
similarly,
in
another
case
which
is
appending
before
the
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari,
we
have
disclosed
the
approximate
times
of
the
overhearings
in
an
effort
to
show
that
they
could
not
have
been
relevant.
now,
with
respect
to
alderman,
whose
conversations
were
not
heard
and
whose
premises
were
not
affected,
it
is
our
position
that
he
has
no
standing
to
object
into
the
evidence
to
the
failure
to
disclose
with
respect
to
conversations
of
alderisio.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
anything
here
which
led
to
other
evidence
whether
any
evidence
which
was
used
against
alderman
was
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
and
if
our
position
is
that
even
though
it
was
illegal
with
respect
to
alderisio,
even
though
there
must
be
disclosure
with
respect
to
alderisio
that
alderman
has
no
standing
to
raise
that
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
that
may
have
produced
the
evidence
which
was
admissible
against
alderman.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
wong
sun
would
be
i
think
the
closest
case
that
is
in
371
u.s.
i
think
to
some
extent,
it's
inherent
in
the
jones
case
which
refers
to
the
person
aggrieved
alderman
is
not
aggrieved
by
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
that's
what
they
were
with
respect
to
other
persons.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
they
are
co-conspirators,
yes.
that
is,
that
is
in
effect
wong
sun.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
would
be
our
position
that
if
there
were
conversations
to
third
parties
when
alderisio
was
not
present
that
he
would
have
no
standing
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
gets
harder.
i
think
there
that
we
might
say
that
he
has
standing
but
we
still
have
the
issue
of
relevance
which
we
contend
should
be
determined
by
the
district
judge
in
camera.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
his
presence
i
suppose.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
there's
very
much
foundation.
i
don't
know
just
where
the
fine
is.
i
don't
know
just
exactly
what
the
basis
of
standing
is.
it
seems
to
shift
and
erode
from
time
to
time.
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
that
if
the
conversation
was
overheard
at
a
time
when
he
was
present
that
he
has
no
standing.
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
i
shall
not
be
sorry.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
is
my
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
it
was
not
his
place
of
business?
i
would
think
it
was
greatly
reduced
of
the
scope
of
his
claim
to
have
standing.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
he
was
--
if
there
are
conversations
of
his
and
to
get
back
to
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
there
were
conversations
made
while
he
was
present,
certainly
if
there
were
conversations
of
his,
he
would
have
standing,
if
there
are
conversation
made
while
he
was
present,
i
find
it
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
isn't
clear
to
me
in
the
case
where
he
is
present
but
did
not
participate
where
he
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
then
it
is
only
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
it
comes
within
the
casual
in
some
way
or
another
and
i
find
a
little
difficulty
in
seeing
that
the
catch
rule
applies
to
a
conversation
on
the
street
corner
and
it's
clear
to
me
that
you
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
think
when
you're
in
a
room
you
are
somewhat
closer
to
the
situation
involved
in
katz
where
you
have
some
expectation
that
what
you
hear
will
not
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
be
closer
to
a
telephone
booth.
the
one
point
to
which
i
have
not
referred
is
simply
why
are
we
concerned
and
that
of
course
relates
to
conversations
of
third
persons
and
in
particular,
conversations
which
were
heard
when
alderisio
was
not
present
where
we
think
they
are
entitled
to
some
protection.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
not
have
supposed
that
it
would
have
been
suggested
that
this
was
not
a
case
involving
the
national
security.
the
fact
is
that
butenko
is
an
american
citizen
was
employed
by
the
international
electronic
company
which
was
under
contract
with
the
air
force
to
produce
a
command
and
control
system
for
the
strategic
air
command.
the
system
includes
data
processing
and
computer
programming
equipment
designed
to
store
and
transmit
operational
information
such
as
the
location
of
aircraft
and
distances
from
targets
which
will
enable
the
commander
of
the
strategic
air
command
to
alert
and
execute
all
these
forces
at
extremely
rapid
rate
and
provide
him
with
up
to
the
minute
information
on
the
status
of
the
total
force.
the
information
supplied
by
the
system
may
be
provided
either
as
a
picture
projected
on
a
screen
or
printed
page
form
and
butenko
who
had
top
secret
clearance
was
the
control
administrator
for
the
projects
field
operations
division
with
complete
clearance
and
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
he
turned
over
materials
to
a
foreign
country.
now,
it's
true
that
the
phrase
national
security
can
be
use
loosely.
it
can
be
use
for
example
to
relate
to
efforts
to
combat
organized
crime
and
things
of
that
sort
as
we
have
used
it
in
these
cases
that
relate
solely
to
relations
with
foreign
nations
and
to
efforts
to
guard
against
espionage
and
to
protect
military
and
national
secrets
of
the
united
states.
i
would
emphasize
again
that
we
are
not
in
this
case
seeking
to
argue
that
the
evidence
is
admissible
although
i
can
conceive
of
cases
as
for
example
if
information
is
obtained
that
there
is
a
ship
on
the
high
seas
which
contains
a
nuclear
device
which
when
the
ship
gets
to
new
york
harbor,
it
is
going
to
be
exploded
and
by
virtue
of
the
very
effective
and
determined
detective
skill,
it
is
not
only
found
where
the
ship
is
but
it
is
also
found
that
it
was
being
brought
here
by
group
of
americans
who
were
seeking
to
takeover
the
government.
at
some
point,
it
sees
to
me
there
ought
to
be
freedom
to
argue
that
whatever
method
was
used
to
obtain
evidence
with
respect
to
that
transaction
is
not
an
unreasonable
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
if
it
is
done
by
united
states
activities
by
officers
of
the
united
states,
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
argue
with
the
fourth
amendment
whatever
it
means.
it's
not
applicable
to
those
officers
of
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
suppose
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
yes
mr.
justice,
i
suppose
that
a
court
martial
trial
in
germany
is
governed
by
the
fifth
amendment
--
a
court
martial
trial
in
the
united
states
--
of
the
united
states
military
person
if
it
is
an
effort
to
exercise
the
force
or
power
of
the
united
states.
now
that
power
is
limited
by
the
fifth
amendment
and
by
the
fourth
amendment,
i
would
assume.
anyway,
we
don't
have
that
involved
here,
the
evidence
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
never
got
to
stay
far
enough
away
so
that
they
could
move
in
after
they
can
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
wouldn't
regard
as
different
from
this.
the
question
is
what
is
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure
and
i
think
reasonable
has
to
be
construed
in
the
light
of
all
the
facts
or
circumstances.
mr.
danzig
has
talked
about
how
nefarious
the
government
is
in
these
places.
all
i
can
say
is
that
five
persons
and
10
attorney
general
have
regarded
it
as
appropriate,
legitimate
and
necessary
to
do
what
is
--
has
been
done
here
and
anyone
who
carries
a
responsibility
of
protecting
the
people
of
this
country
against
possible
foreign
attack
will
recognize
the
need
to
be
very
thorough
and
comprehensive
in
that
task.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
would
think
that's
a
way
of
putting
it
with
the
only
crime
that
is
enormous
enough,
it
seems
to
me
would
be
massive
treason,
massive
destruction
of
people
and
property
of
the
country.
i
would
not
make
it
applicable
to
any
ordinary
crime.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
depends
on
how
big
the
mass
is
if
it's
by
nuclear
weapons
i
might
be
willing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
that
i
am
trying
to
do
mr.
justice
is
to
reserve
what
the
future
with
respect
to
a
case
that
the
awful
facts
of
which
i
cannot
now
imagine.
the
right
to
contend
that
very
vigorous
and
thorough
activities
made
by
the
people
responsible
for
protecting
the
country
are
not
such
as
to
prevent
the
evidence
obtained
by
those
activities
from
being
admitted
into
evidence.
we
are
not
making
any
such
argument
here.
we
are
not
contending
that
any
evidence
obtained
by
these
methods
or
any
evidence
which
was
produced
from
a
lead
obtained
from
this
evidence
of
these
methods
is
admissible
in
this
case.
we
are
arguing
here
simply
that
in
a
situation
where
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
electronic
surveillance
had
no
relation
whatever
to
the
evidence
produced
at
the
trial
that
we
should
be
free
to
establish
that
fact
for
the
united
states
district
judge
without
its
being
disclose
not
merely
to
the
defendant
but
as
an
inevitable
in
the
case
of
this
sort
to
the
other
nation
which
may
be
involved.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
may
i
say
in
personal
answer
to
that,
what
was
done
in
the
katz
case
was
legal
when
it
was
done.
it
only
became
illegal
as
result
of
the
katz
decision
itself.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
produced.
it
was
within
decision
of
the
court
itself
standing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
true
that
during
the
past
summer,
congress
has
enacted
the
statute
which
expressly
excludes
national
security
situations
or
expressly
authorizes
the
surveillance
and
national
security
situation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
in
quite
broad
term
mr.
justice
when
authorize
by
the
attorney
--
mr.
chief
justice
when
authorize
by
the
attorney
general.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
what
your
question,
great
many
things
happened
prior
to
1965,
many
things
which
i
regret,
many
things
which
have
cost
great
difficulties
for
me
and
through
us
for
the
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
since
1965,
the
requirements
have
been
very
clear
and
very
specific,
there
is
no
eavesdropping
or
bugging
whatever
since
1965
and
no
case
were
there
has
been
any
evidence
whatever
that
there
has
been
bugging
or
eavesdropping
except
in
the
cases
of
national
security.
the
passage
in
the
act
to
pass
by
congress
this
summer,
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
is
on
page
7
of
our
brief
in
ivanov
and
butenko.
nothing
contained
in
this
chapter
or
in
section
605
of
the
communications
act
shall
limit
the
constitutional
power
of
the
president
to
take
such
measure
as
he
deemed
necessary,
to
protect
the
nation
against
actual
or
potential
attack
or
other
hostile
acts
of
a
foreign
power
to
obtain
foreign
intelligence
information
deemed
to
central
for
the
security
of
the
united
states
or
to
protect
national
security
information
against
foreign
intelligence
activities.
and
all
that
we
would
contend
for
would
be
a
decision
here
which
would
leave
that
statement
by
congress
in
effective
operation
and
if
there
has
to
be
disclosure
of
merely
incidental
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
counsel
in
the
other
side
quite
appropriately
contended
in
terms
of
methods
of
material
and
inevitable
connection
with
the
case
involved.
the
fact
is
that
in
a
number
of
these
situations,
people
just
wander
in
to
a
surveillance.
it's
perfectly
incidental,
perfectly
accidental,
perfectly
obvious
that
nothing
out
of
it
has
any
relation
to
the
subsequent
and
wholly
unrelated
crime.
we
have
felt
that
whenever
the
name
appears
that
we
must
make
disclosure
to
this
court
as
we
have
what
we
do
feel
that
the
details
that
the
defendant
can
be
adequately
protected
if
the
details
are
disclose
to
the
district
judge
and
he
can
determine
that
nothing
happened
which
was
arguably
relevant
to
the
particular
prosecution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
understand
that
the
recent
act
of
congress
necessarily
controls
these
cases.
i
know
nothing
in
it
which
is
formally
retroactive,
i
would
suppose
that
the
decision
made
in
this
case
would
have
to
be
one
fashioned
by
this
court
out
of
the
materials
which
are
available
to
court
which
would
include
the
several
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
i
point
out
several
because
it's
not
only
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
also
the
powers
granted
to
the
president.
the
long
continued
practice
which
goes
back
to
the
origins
of
the
republic
undoubtedly
to
the
necessities
of
the
situation,
to
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
and
when
all
of
these
are
taken
into
account,
i
think
you
are
confronted
with
a
balancing
consideration
between
the
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
are
not
absolute.
they
provide
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
we've
long
been
guarded
and
long
been
warned
against
the
pressing
constitutional
doctrines
to
their
logical
extreme
and
when
you
take
into
account
all
of
the
factors
involved
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
come
up
with
an
appropriate
construction
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
circumstances
in
this
case
which
will
adequately
protect
the
rights
of
the
defendant
by
providing
for
disclosure
in
the
first
instance
to
the
district
judge.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
i
think
not
mr.
justice
but
i
think
it
is
on
disclosure
to
the
district
judge
by
the
district
judge
himself.
i
don't
think
you'll
get
to
it
because
he
will
immediately
see
that
there
is
nothing
which
is
by
any
conceivable
stretch
of
imagination
relevant
to
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
might
get
a
more
limited
disclosure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
turns
out
with
a
standing
proposition,
we
--
you
may
have
to
have
more
separate
trials
when
you
know
that
in
advance
in
which
case
there
might
not
be
any
disclosure
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
i
think
that
would
be
our
position.
no
matter
what
rule
the
court
makes,
there's
known
to
be
an
area
where
the
government
is
going
to
have
exercise
some
kind
of
judgment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
began
as
an
indictment
in
the
district
court
for
colorado
for
conspiracy
to
transmit
in
interstate
commerce
communications
containing
threats
designed
to
injure
one,
robert
sunshine.
there
were
then
four
defendants;
one
was
acquitted
and
of
course
is
not
here.
the
other
three
defendants
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
at
the
trial,
the
defendant
kolod
sought
to
introduce
evidence
about
an
illegal
surveillance
which
is
the
fancy
way
to
call
it,
bugging
is
the
other
way
it's
called
at
the
desert
inn
in
las
vegas,
nevada.
he
offered
this
in
rebuttal
in
order
he
said
to
disprove
or
offset
evidence
offered
by
the
government.
the
trial
court
examined
the
materials
in
camera
and
held
that
they
were
not
relevant
and
that
the
evidence
could
not
be
introduced.
the
three
defendants
who
were
convicted
appealed
to
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
pending
the
appeal,
the
government
disclosed
that
it
had
additional
files
relating
to
conversations
overheard
at
the
desert
inn.
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
examine
this
material
in
camera.
the
court
found
nothing
admissible
in
the
additional
material.
thereafter,
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
the
convictions.
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
here
and
was
denied
in
october
1967.
now
that
is
the
background.
before
going
further,
i
should
point
out
that
the
electronic
surveillance
material
examined
in
the
courts
below
related
to
the
defendant
kolod
and
the
premises
which
he
used
in
las
vegas,
nevada.
kolod
has
since
died
and
the
petition
as
to
him
has
been
dismissed
on
january
29th
of
this
year.consequently,
there
is
nothing
now
before
the
court
relating
to
the
electronic
surveillance
material
which
was
considered
by
the
courts
below.
we
now
have
wholly
new
problem.
at
the
post
trial
hearing
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
here,
counsel
for
alderisio,
another
--
the
defendants
stated
that
there
was
newly
discovered
evidence
of
a
wiretap
or
listening
device
used
against
his
client
in
chicago
between
october
1,
1960
and
december
31,
1962.?
the
nature
or
source
of
this
evidence
was
not
stated,
it
is
this
surveillance
in
chicago
relating
to
the
petitioner
alderisio
with
which
the
court
is
now
concern.
after
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
petitioners
sought
an
order
suspending
the
denial
of
certiorari
pending
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
a
rehearing.
mr.
spritzer,
the
acting
solicitor
general
made
a
typewritten
response
to
this
application.
thereafter,
the
petitioner
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
a
motion
for
the
disclosure
of
electronic
surveillance
and
this
is
the
matter
which
is
now
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
just
before
the
recess,
i
said
that
counsel
for
the
petitioners
had
filed
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
and
a
motion
for
the
disclosure
of
electronic
surveillance
and
that
that
was
where
we
were
now.
i
left
out
another
step
which
is
the
step
which
is
the
one
which
brings
us
here.
the
united
states
made
a
response
to
that
motion
and
the
court
then
on
january
29th,
entered
an
order
with
--
an
opinion
remanding
the
case
for
an
adversary
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
it
was
then
that
the
united
states
filed
the
motion
which
is
now
before
the
court.
this
is
entitled
a
motion
to
modify
the
order
of
the
court.
in
this
motion,
we
accept
without
a
question
of
any
sort
this
court's
decision
that
the
petitioners
here
are
entitled
to
the
independent
determination
of
a
court.
we
urged
however
that
this
should
be
done
in
the
first
instance
by
the
judge
in
camera
with
the
judge
then
being
free
to
order
such
further
proceedings
as
he
may
deem
necessary
or
appropriate
as
a
result
of
his
examination.
this
is
the
procedure,
we
would
point
out
which
was
followed
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
kolod
surveillance
in
las
vegas.
this
was
directly
approved
by
the
court
below
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
with
the
questions
specifically
raised
in
the
petition.
of
course
that
denial
is
in
no
sense
binding
on
the
court
but
i
do
mentioned
it
to
show
that
there
is
some
precedent
for
what
we
urged
and
similarly
the
seventh
circuit
as
recently
sustains
such
a
procedure
in
the
case
of
battaglia
against
united
states
which
was
decided
there
on
april
10th.
why
should
we
be
concerned?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
its
--
it
is
simply
cited
that
way
in
our
brief
mr.
justice,
battaglia
against
united
states
but
it
is
not
yet
in
any
--
in
the
federal
reporter.
i
have
a
copy
of
the
opinion
here
which
i
can
gladly
leave
with
the
clerk
if
that
would
be
helpful.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
why
should
be
we
concerned?
why
shouldn't
the
defendants
and
their
counsel
be
free
to
see
everything
and
make
what
they
can
of
it?
to
borrow
a
phrase,
the
automatic
knee-jerk
reaction
would
be
that
way.
the
question
is
whether
there
are
any
other
factors
in
the
situation
which
merit
further
consideration.
i'm
not
sure
that
there
are,
i
can
say
though
that
the
entire
problem
is
a
very
trouble
someone
and
is
full
of
difficulties.
various
aspects
of
it
have
been
before
the
court
in
seven
cases
which
have
been
disposed
of
and
there
are
now
six
cases
pending
before
the
court
in
which
it
is
involved
including
this
one.
for
the
possible
convenience
of
the
court,
these
have
all
been
lifted
--
listed
in
a
brief
memorandum
which
i
prepared
and
have
asked
the
clerk
to
make
available
to
the
court.
i
find
in
the
process,
i've
tried
to
put
together
a
complete
collection
of
all
of
the
papers
which
have
dealt
with
this
problem
and
they're
now
32
items
in
my
collection
and
it's
something
of
a
task
simply
to
keep
them
sorted
out
in
one's
mind.
the
problem
first
became
apparent
nearly
two
years
ago
in
the
case
of
black
against
the
united
states
where
after
the
denial
of
certiorari,
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
memorandum
in
may
1966
which
disclosed
electronic
surveillance.
in
response
to
instructions
from
the
court,
a
further
memorandum
was
filed
in
july
1966
going
in
to
considerable
detail
not
only
as
to
what
had
been
done
but
also
what
the
department
of
justice
was
doing
about
it.
the
court
then
vacated
the
conviction
of
black
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court.
in
that
case,
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
materials
were
relevant
and
the
sole
question
was
to
determine
whether
they
had
led
to
any
of
the
evidence
that
was
used
at
the
trial.
why
should
not
the
same
procedure
be
used
in
every
case?
perhaps
it
should.
this
is
not
an
area
where
there
are
any
clear
guides
either
of
principle
or
of
experience.
i've
worried
about
the
problem
almost
constantly
for
the
past
six
months.
as
a
result,
i
have
at
least
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
some
matters
which
are
worthy
of
consideration.
the
problem
of
relevance
of
the
material
is
one
you
can't
get
away
from.
one
might
say,
well,
you
bugged
him,
didn't
you?
you
admit
you
did,
why
don't
you
come
plea
and
give
him
the
material?
but
perhaps
it's
more
complicated
than
that.
seeing
the
fruits
of
bugging
as
a
new
experience
for
me,
it's
a
little
like
putting
a
live
television
camera
on
a
street
corner
all
sorts
of
things
happen,
most
of
it
is
very
dull,
some
of
the
rest
is
titillating
but
quite
irrelevant.
there's
an
almost
infinite
gradation.
let
us
suppose
that
a
microphone
is
put
in
a
room
which
picks
up
a
conference
between
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer.
of
course
this
should
be
disclosed
and
where
any
conversations
between
a
defendant
and
his
lawyer
have
appeared,
we
have
always
disclosed
this
since
the
problem
arose.
we
may
next
suppose
that
a
bug
is
put
in
a
room
of
defendant
a,
this
may
pick
up
conversations
of
a
and
these
may
or
may
not
have
any
conceivable
connection
with
a
criminal
prosecution.
a
may
discuss
a
contemplated
crime,
this
might
be
the
crime
for
which
he
is
being
prosecuted
or
some
other
unrelated
crime
or
a
may
discuss
a
trip
he
plans
to
take
with
another
man's
wife
intrastate
in
order
to
keep
it
from
being
federal.
moreover,
if
a's
premises
are
bugged,
particularly
office
or
business
premises,
conversations
of
many
persons
may
be
picked
up.
in
experience,
most
of
the
records
of
the
bugging
of
a's
premises
will
consist
of
conversations
of
other
persons
than
a
quite
often
without
a
being
present.
of
course
such
conversation
might
be
relevant
to
criminal
conduct
by
a
and
we
agree
that
a
judge
should
decide
that
question.
but
generally
they
will
not
though
they
may
involve
other
persons
often
in
highly
libelous
or
embarrassing
ways.
should
everything
be
disclosed
to
a
and
his
counsel
even
though
the
conversations
are
of
other
people
who
had
no
reason
to
expect
that
their
conversations
would
be
overheard.
there's
a
catch
overtone
in
this
problem
even
though
the
conversations
are
of
other
people
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
a's
activities.
perhaps
most
remote
is
the
situation
where
the
bug
is
put
on
b
unconnected
with
a.
but
a
wonders
into
the
picture.
a
comes
into
the
room
for
some
purpose,
perhaps
business,
perhaps
a
social
call,
perhaps
out
of
curiosity
or
by
mistake.
what
may
be
picked
up
from
a
may
be
relevant
but
does
this
mean
that
the
entire
record
should
be
made
available
for
a's
inspection.
in
an
underworld
atmosphere
which
is
sometimes
involved
in
this
cases,
there
maybe
wholly
irrelevant
things
said
by
other
persons
which
would
be
very
interesting
indeed
to
the
person
who
would
not
get
such
information
unless
there
had
been
illegal
activity
by
representatives
of
the
government.
should
all
of
these
be
made
available
to
a
merely
because
at
some
point
he
came
in
to
the
sound
tracking?
it's
bad
enough
that
there
was
such
illegal
activity
but
does
the
fact
there
was
illegal
activity
mean
that
its
fruits
must
be
broadcast
to
the
world.
as
happened
in
the
(inaudible)
case
in
boston
last
may
where
the
materials
became
an
exhibit
in
the
case
to
somebody's
carelessness,
i
don't
know
who,
it
was
not
sealed,
they
were
then
copied
by
the
press
in
the
clerk's
office
and
reproduced
with
big
headlines
by
many
newspapers.
it
said
that
this
can
be
safeguarded
against
by
proper
protective
orders
in
the
district
court.
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
this
has
not
worked
perfectly
in
practice
and
i
doubt
that
it
will
in
the
future.
in
any
event,
it
does
not
protect
third
persons
from
disclosure
to
the
defendant
himself.
and
that
may
in
some
cases
be
a
very
serious
matter.
suppose,
for
example,
that
in
the
bugging
of
a's
premises,
two
of
his
lieutenants
were
picked
up
in
his
absence
discussing
how
they
might
displaced
it.
thus,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
question
of
what
disclosure
the
government
makes
of
conversations
which
it
has
overheard,
involves
more
than
just
a
right
of
a
particular
defendant
before
the
court.
it
involves
the
right
of
each
of
the
participants
to
the
conversation.
we
believe
that
the
rights
of
these
other
participants
in
overheard
conversations
and
of
still
other
persons
to
whom
reference
is
made
in
conversations
are
also
entitled
to
protection
and
that
the
interest
these
individuals
have
in
keeping
the
conversations
private
will
often
militate
against
the
unnecessary
disclosure
of
the
conversations
to
the
defendant.
under
the
procedure
that
mr.
williams
proposes,
no
protection
would
be
given
to
the
interest
to
these
third
persons.
we
submit
that
by
giving
the
trial
judge
the
discretion
to
make
an
in
camera
examination
of
the
records
of
the
overhearing
some
degree
of
protection
can
be
provided
to
these
third
parties
since
records
of
their
conversation
would
only
be
disclosed
to
the
defendant
if
they
were
arguably
relevant
to
the
case
at
issue.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is,
it
is
however
to
coin
another
phrase,
a
condition
and
not
of
theory
that
we
are
confronted
with.
i
have
sometimes
felt
that
the
answer
is
that
we
should
gather
up
all
of
these
records
and
take
them
to
the
place
in
the
treasury
where
they
disposed
of
worn
out
paper
money
and
have
them
all
totally
destroyed,
macerated
i
think
is
the
term
with
appropriate
witnesses.
but
we
obviously
cant
do
that,
indeed
in
one
of
the
cases
now
pending
before
the
court,
mcgarry
against
the
united
states
number
1184,
we
are
in
trouble
because
something
like
that
did
happen.
the
records
there
were
destroyed,
i
think
without
any
evil
intent
but
the
fact
is
that
they're
gone
and
we
don't
--
we
can't
say
what
was
in
them.
my
observation
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
been
very
methodical
about
all
this.
their
records
have
been
well
and
carefully
kept.
one
can
find
out
where
a
bug
is
placed
and
the
dates
when
it
was
in
use.
there's
an
index
not
merely
of
the
person's
bug
but
a
person's
mentioned
in
the
interceptive
conversations.
however,
in
the
case
of
some
other
government
agencies,
the
records
are
more
scanted.
often
records
have
been
destroyed
and
indexing
is
less
than
satisfactory.
i
suppose
that
with
the
passage
of
time,
these
problems
will
fade
away.
but
for
the
time
being,
they
are
very
troublesome.
finally,
i
come
to
another
and
very
important
aspect
of
the
question.
it's
not
directly
involved
in
this
kolod
case
but
the
order
here
may
affect
it
and
it
cannot
be
overlooked.
the
question
is
involved
in
ivanov
against
the
united
states,
number
885
and
butenko
against
the
united
states
number
1007
miscellaneous
which
are
pending
before
the
court
on
petition
of
certiorari.
these
are
national
security
cases.
for
a
great
many
years,
electronic
surveillance
has
been
specifically
authorized
and
used
in
cases
involving
national
security
as
is
done
by
every
other
country
in
the
world.
we're
not
asking
the
court
in
this
case
to
pass
on
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
situations
where
the
surveillance
has
been
undertaken
in
order
to
protect
the
national
security
or
a
military
secret,
although
it
can
surely
be
argued
that
the
line
of
reasonableness
and
after
all
this
is
one
place
where
the
constitution
does
use
that
word.
what
it
prohibits
is
not
all
searches
and
seizures
but
on
reasonable
searches
and
seizures.
this
is
one
where
the
line
of
reasonableness
surely
varies
with
the
circumstances.
we
do
suggest
too
that
super
--
that
experience
supports
the
view
that
there
are
matters
which
a
nation
cannot
afford
to
overlook
in
its
own
self
protection.
where
the
persons
involved
have
diplomatic
status,
they
can
be
expelled.
why
are
we
concern
then?
well,
there
are
other
cases
of
which
ivanov
and
butenko
are
examples,
where
criminal
prosecution
is
appropriate.
if
there
has
been
electronic
surveillance,
we
in
the
department
of
justice
cannot
pass
on
its
relevance
ourselves.
we
accept
that
view
and
agree
with
it
but
we
think
that
question
of
relevance
in
such
cases
should
surely
be
first
determined
by
the
judge
in
camera
without
further
disclosure
unless
he
concludes
that
such
further
disclosure
is
necessary
or
appropriate.
i'm
advised
that
unless
disclosure
can
be
confined
to
in
camera
consideration
by
the
judge,
it
will
be
necessary
to
discontinue
prosecution
in
most
of
these
cases
involving
the
national
security,
for
the
disclosure
cannot
be
made
in
a
way
that
may
become
public
or
to
persons
who
are
agents
of
foreign
governments.
that
means
among
other
things
that
we
cannot
prosecute
even
though
the
surveillance
is
wholly
unrelated
to
the
prosecution.
if
we
do
not
prosecute,
we
cannot
vindicate
the
law
against
espionage
in
these
cases
as
in
ivanov
and
butenko.
in
that
event,
we
will
not
only
have
a
few
less
people
in
our
jails
but
also
fewer
people
to
trade
and
thus
more
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
release
of
americans
held
in
other
countries.
i
may
say
too
that
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
authority
to
suggest
that
there
could
be
disclosure
for
these
cases
even
to
judge
in
camera.
this
is
more
than
would
be
done
in
other
countries
and
perhaps
we
should
not
handicap
ourselves
too
much.
this
court
has
long
recognized
certain
special
powers
in
the
president
in
the
field
of
foreign
relations
and
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
army
and
navy.
the
zimmerman
note
and
the
breaking
of
the
purple
codes
are
important
events
in
our
history
and
they
were
both
done
by
interception.
it
is
said
that
when
secretary
simpson
was
secretary
of
state
in
the
early
1930's,
he
terminated
this
activity
and
in
state
department
saying
that,
gentleman,
don't
read
other
people's
mail
but
by
the
time
he
became
secretary
of
war
again
in
1941,
he
changed
his
view.
here,
there
are
constitutional
provisions
which
point
in
different
ways
and
the
procedure
i
suggest
may
be
a
way
of
harmonizing
them.
there
are
other
situations
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
where
the
district
judge
on
his
own
responsibility
and
without
a
formally
adversary
hearing
makes
determinations
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
this
has
recently
been
recognized
by
this
court
with
respect
to
prior
statements
of
witnesses
given
to
the
government
so
called
jencks
act
statement
and
also
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
government
witnesses
that's
involved
in
the
palermo
case
and
then
the
dennis
cases
both
rather
recently
decided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
a
question
of
words
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
think
mr.--
procedure
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
exactly
the
same
procedure
that
was
followed
in
this
kolod
case
in
the
district
court
in
two
places.
the
materials
are
made
available
to
the
district
judge,
the
other
side
is
advised
that
the
materials
are
made
available
to
the
district
judge
but
the
district
judge,
if
he
decides
that
they
are
not
relevant,
simply
advises
both
parties
that
the
materials
are
not
relevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
course
the
materials
are
then
preserved
under
seal
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
go
to
the
appellate
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
that
the
other
side
does
know
in
all
cases
about
the
fact
of
the
material.
the
government
has
disclosed
the
materials
in
these
cases.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
think
you're
quite
right
mr.
justice,
up
until
the
kolod
decision
unless
the
government
concluded
that
they
were
arguably
relevant
and
that
was
interpreted
very
broadly.
there
was
not
even
disclosure
that
is
correct.
under
the
court's
decision
in
kolod
which
we
accept,
we
would
now
disclose
everything
where
the
person
involved
is
mentioned
involved
in
anyway
but
we
would
submit
it
to
the
judge
to
decide
whether
there
was
anything
in
it
which
required
further
proceeding
of
any
kind.
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
how
you
can
specify
or
how
it's
very
useful
to
the
other
side
to
specify.
you
say
we
disclosed
so
many
logs
containing
so
many
pages
and
we
say
that
what's
on
pages
84
to
96
shouldn't
go
to
the
defendant.
he
doesn't
know
what
on
pages
84
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
should
certainly
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
have
that
right
and
they
would
know
in
all
of
these
cases
that
the
material
had
been
submitted
to
the
district
judge
and
that
he
had
excluded
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
certainly
part
of
our
position.
we
have
no
suggestion
that
this
be
done
secretly
by
the
district
court
in
the
sense
that
the
other
side
doesn't
know
that
it's
being
done.
we
do
think
that
the
district
judge
ought
to
do
it
without
disclosing
the
content
of
the
material
to
the
other
side.
we
submit
that
in
balancing
all
of
the
factors
in
this
difficult
situation,
the
sound
solution
is
to
provide
for
disclosure
to
the
district
judge
and
i
would
add
with
knowledge
to
the
other
side
that
this
is
been
done.
with
such
further
proceedings,
as
he
may
think
necessary
or
appropriate
and
for
this
reasons
we
submit
that
our
motion
to
modify
the
order
of
the
court
should
be
granted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
of
igor
a.
ivanov
who
with
john
william
butenko
was
indicted
in
the
district
of
new
jersey.
the
indictment
is
in
the
record
an
on
page
11,
the
grand
jury
charge
that
they
and
three
other
persons
did
unlawfully,
willfully,
and
knowingly
conspire
and
agree
to
communicate,
deliver,
and
transmit
to
a
foreign
government
which
is
named
and
the
representatives
and
agents
thereof
directly
and
indirectly,
information
relating
to
the
national
defense
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
particularly
information
relating
to
the
command
and
control
system
of
the
strategic
air
command
of
the
united
states
air
force
with
intent
and
reason
to
believe
that
the
said
information
would
be
use
to
the
advantage
of
a
foreign
nation
which
is
named.
the
other
three
persons
had
diplomatic
immunity
being
members
of
a
delegation
to
the
united
states;
ivanov
is
a
citizen
of
the
soviet
union.
he
was
an
employee
in
united
states
of
the
amtorg
trading
corporation,
as
such
did
not
have
a
diplomatic
community.
butenko
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
the
question
with
respect
to
him
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
that
with
respect
to
ivanov
is
involved
in
no.
197
which
is
the
next
case
on
the
argument
list.
the
problem
here
in
many
respects
is
similar
to
that
in
the
alderman
and
alderisio
cases.
most
of
mr.
williams
argument
in
this
case
was
in
fact
directed
to
the
issues
in
the
alderman
and
alderisio
case
with
respect
to
its
standing,
i
will
not
undertake
to
discuss
that
any
further
except
to
point
out
that
the
statement
that
the
overhearing
in
alderman
and
alderisio
was
on
alderisio's
business
premises
is
one
which
has
been
made
by
mr.
williams
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
preface
to
of
course
with
we
understand,
it
--
i
do
not
believe
it
can
be
found
in
any
paper
which
has
been
filed
by
the
government
except
one
file
by
mr.
sprecher
in
which
he
quoted
that
passage
from
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
government
affirm
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
government
did
not
assert
or
deny
with
respect
to
that,
it
did
admit
that
there
had
been
electronic
surveillance
and
in
its
brief
filed
in
this
court,
it
did
make
a
further
statement.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
position
of
the
government
today
is
what
is
stated
in
--
but
note
1
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
alderman
case,
we
are
advised
that
the
places
where
alderisio's
conversations
were
overheard
were
not
his
own
but
business
establishments
owned
by
associates
of
his
or
firms
that
employed
him
and
that
alderisio
himself
did
not
have
office
space
in
the
subject
premises.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
this
issue
was
never
been
considered
in
anyway,
shape
or
manner
by
the
court
below
in
this
case.
the
problem
with
respect
to
electronic
surveillance
of
alderisio
did
not
get
into
this
case
until
after
this
court
had
denied
certiorari.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
may
be
the
question
of
standing,
maybe
affected
by
that
but
still
to
be
our
position
that
even
though
it
is
found
that
alderisio
has
standing,
the
judge
ought
to
decide
in
camera
whether
the
material
is
relevant
in
any
way
here
for
the
reasons
developed
in
that
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
really
think
so
mr.
justice
but
if
he
has
no
standing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
would
be
the
only
thing
that
ought
to
be
considered.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
if
it's
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
his
home
or
even
at
his
business
premises
or
under
mancuso
at
a
place
where
he
has
a
regular
desk
space,
it
may
well
be
--
he
may
well
have
a
larger
place
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
he
may
have
standing
but
it
would
still
be
our
position
if
the
judge
ought
to
make
a
preliminary
determination
as
to
whether
the
material
has
any
conceivable
reference
to
the
particular
case,
particularly
as
it
involves
third
parties.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
there's
no
standing
on
the
tapes
never
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
correct.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
they
must
be
turned
over
to
the
judge.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
in
this
particular
case,
there
are
not
packing
cases
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
like
to
mr.
justice,
i
would
think
that
there
--
if
he
has
standing,
there
ought
them
to
be
turned
over
to
the
judge
any
records
of
conversations
in
which
he
was
a
party
on
either
side
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
myself
any
conversations
which
took
place
while
he
was
present
but
i
don't
know
of
any
authority
or
net
and
i'm
groping
on
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
turn
everything
that
--
everything
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly,
if
it
was
his
home.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
you're
wrong
mr.
justice
because
i
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
the
following
case
will
illustrate
that
to
some
extent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
certainly
not
in
the
national
security
case
which
is
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that's
--
but
that
is
the
reason
why
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
make
a
general
answer
to
your
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
have
taken
the
--
we
have
taken
the
position
that
any
conversation
between
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
must
be
turned
over
without
further
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
the
defendant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
it
was
fixing
a
go
off
date.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
any
conversation
we're
living
out
national
security
now
too
between
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
must
be
disclosed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
yes.
oh,
yes!
that's
the
objective
of
turning
it
over
to
the
trial
judge,
if
he
says
that
it
must
be
disclosed
under
these
conditions
or
various
circumstances,
we
undertake
to
be,
of
course
to
be
mummed
by
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
certainly
mr.
justice.
any
material
which
we
regard
as
relevant
has
as
a
matter
of
fact
over
the
past
three
years
been
turned
over
to
the
defense.
the
only
problem
arises
with
respect
the
material
which
it
has
contended
is
not
arguably
relevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
variations
and
the
facts
are
unlimited
and
it
will
probably
have
to
be
worked
out
in
the
jones
case,
the
defendant
had
small
interest
in
the
premises.
he
was
a
licensee
at
will
i
suppose
to
use
the
old
lingo.
he
was
a
guess
in
the
premises
but
he
was
there
at
the
time.
there
are
differences
between
his
owning
the
premises
if
the
premises
being
owned
by
someone
else
but
he
being
a
science
specific
space
in
them
which
is
his
as
a
right
for
the
time
being
and
others
who
are
yet
simply
guess
or
a
transient
in
the
premises.
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
lay
down
any
dogmatic
line
as
to
just
where
the
alliance
should
be
drawn.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
there
maybe
under
the
katz
case
if
b
and
c
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
a
has
--
even
though
a
has
consented
as
suggested.
even
thought
the
telephone
company
consented
in
the
katz
case,
i
don't
think
that
would've
made
any
difference.
i
think
that
b
and
c
have
to
have
such
relationship
to
the
premises
that
they
have
reason
to
think
that
their
conversation
there
is
private
and
not
being
disclosed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
answer
no
on
what
basis
b
and
c
are
in
the
premises.
did
a
tell
him
they
were
free
to
use
the
room
anytime
they
wanted
to?
did
he
invite
them
there?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
trying
to
interpret
to
katz
case
in
its
limitation
and
i'm
not
sure
just
what
difference
it
makes.
i
know
that
if
it's
a
telephone
booth,
they
have
a
right
to
expect
their
conversations
will
not
be
overheard.
i
wouldn't
have
supposed
that
the
katz
case
was
limited
to
telephone
booths.
we're
now
turning
to
the
ivanov
case.
incidentally,
there
is
an
aspect
with
respect
the
standing
that
i
can
make
here.
the
fact
is
that
ivanov
and
butenko
were
never
overheard
talking
together.
there
are
overhearings
of
ivanov
and
there
are
separate
overhearings
of
butenko,
and
i
supposed
that
an
argument
could
be
made
that
butenko
has
no
standing
to
object
with
respect
to
the
overhearings
of
ivanov
and
vice
versa.
however,
in
none
of
these
cases
did
the
overhearing
have
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
evidence
which
was
actually
produced
at
the
trial.
it
is
totally
irrelevant
to
that
and
the
problem
which
i
am
concerned
here
is
the
appropriate
protection
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
in
carrying
out
the
president's
responsibility
to
conduct
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
and
his
responsibility
as
commander-in-chief
of
the
army
and
navy.
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
what
was
done
here
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
because
the
fourth
amendment
forbids
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
in
those
words.
and
the
question
as
to
what
is
reasonable
obviously
varies
with
the
circumstances.
but
we
are
not
making
any
contention
and
there
is
not
involved
in
this
case
any
question
of
the
admission
of
evidence
which
was
obtained
by
a
reason
of
electronic
surveillance
and
we
are
contending
that
there
was
no
evidence
admitted
in
this
case
which
is
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
which
was
derived
from
an
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
williams
has
argued
very
eloquently
that
in
a
free
country
that
the
executive
ought
to
be
free
to
do
this
but
then
it
ought
to
be
put
to
its
choice
either
to
disclose
or
to
abandon
the
prosecution.
now
actually
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
kaplan
case,
the
prosecution
was
abandoned
and
mr.
williams
said
that
was
the
only
one
in
all
the
year
since
what
in
the
brief
for
butenko
on
page
27.
there
are
cited
two
other
cases,
united
states
against
egorov
and
united
states
against
sokolov
where
cases
were
dismissed
"in
the
interest
of
national
security"
and
there
had
been
other
cases
which
have
not
been
brought
because
the
evidence
was
in
fact
obtained
through
illegal
surveillance
and
the
officers
of
the
government
felt
that
they
could
not
appropriately
proceed
in
those
cases.
but
here
we
have
a
united
states
citizen
and
a
russian
citizen
not
entitled
to
diplomatic
immunity
and
we
have
a
situation
where
disclosure
has
been
made
that
there
was
electronic
surveillance
and
the
suggestion
is
made
that
that
electronic
surveillance
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
anything
which
has
a
period
in
the
prosecution
and
it
is
our
position
and
i
think
i
should
be
frank
to
say
that
this
is
the
case
in
which
we
are
concerned
not
to
alderman
and
alderisio,
we
can
live
with
that
of
course.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
yes,
mr.
justice
exactly,
and
the
whole
relation
of
the
executive
power
here
and
the
whole
question
of
the
balance
which
it
seems
to
me
is
clear
and
important.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
after
it,
i
don't
know
of
any
other
way
that
would
be
that
is
the
--
that
he
is
the
person
who
appeared
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
the
question
would
undoubtedly
be
considered
by
appropriate
officers
in
the
department
but
the
person
who
normally
appeared
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
leaves
the
impression
that
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
is
acting
on
his
own
as
an
independent
man
often
in
provinces,
some
place
and
maybe
he
will
and
maybe
he
won't.
actually,
these
matters
are
very
closely
watched
by
senior
officers
in
the
department
of
justice
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
acts
on
instructions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
that
is,
that
is
exactly
our
position
here.
i
may
say
i
had
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
getting
it
established
that
we
could
take
that
position
here.
the
view
which
would
be
taken
in
a
case
of
this
sort
in
any
other
country
i
know
of
is
that
neither
this
court
nor
anyone
else
would've
ever
heard
anything
about
it.
we
have
not
taken
that
position,
we
have
made
disclosure
that
there
was
electronic
surveillance
following
the
order
in
the
kolod
case.
we
have
sought
to
get
that
order
modified
so
that
though
there
will
be
disclosure
it
will
be
disclosure
to
the
district
judge.
now,
here
all
the
protective
orders
that
mr.
williams
can
divide
will
not
help
because
if
it
is
disclose
to
counsel
and
the
parties,
it
is
disclose
to
a
man
who
had
a
direct
contact
with
the
place
where
it
is
not
desirable
in
the
national
interest
that
there
be
disclosure.
moreover
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
we
--
our
position
would
be
the
same
whether
it
did
or
not.
we
are
not
arguing
here
that
it
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
we
are
suggesting
that
there
is
round
on
which
it
could
be
argued
and
there
may
be
some
future
day
when
another
ex
parte
quirin
comes
along
where
it
may
develop
that
evidence
was
obtained
against
german
saboteurs
who
landed
on
our
shore
by
wiretapping
and
electronic
surveillance
and
that
that
was
the
evidence
which
there
was
and
which
the
government
chose
to
produce
and
i
frankly
would
like
not
to
foreclose
the
decision
which
might
be
made
in
such
case
in
time
of
war.
in
this
case,
we
are
not
contending
that
any
evidence
so
obtain
was
admissible.
we
are
only
contending
that
when
the
position
is
that
the
electronics
surveillance
did
not
in
anyway
lead
to
the
evidence
which
was
used
in
the
court
that
the
decision
of
that
question
should
be
made
by
the
district
judge
in
camera
without
disclosure
to
the
parties
or
the
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
still
mr.
justice
would
like
to
reserve
at
sometime
the
right
to
argue
that
there
has
not
been
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
but
we
are
conceding
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
this
was
taken
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
here
and
in
the
district
court,
we
are
conceding
that
this
is
in
violation
or
this
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
want
to
reserve
it
for
another
case
at
another
time
under
different
circumstances
involving
the
national
security.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
turns
up
in
these
cases
involving
national
security
is
that
people
just
wonder
in
to
the
surveillance.
let
us
suppose
that
the
government
has
duly
authorized
the
attorney
general
to
--
duly
authorize
by
the
attorney
general
has
entered
into
a
surveillance
directly
connected
with
the
national
security.
no
one
can
question
under
this
case
it
is
directly
connected
with
the
national
security.
supposed
that
the
record
reads
like
this;
a
person
answers
the
telephone
and
says
"hello,"
the
other
party
says,
"this
is
john
brown,
i
want
talk
with
joe."
the
response
is,
"joe
who?"
the
calling
party
says,
"why,
joe
smith
of
course,"
to
which
the
response
is,
"there
is
no
joe
smith
here,
you
must
have
the
wrong
number,"
and
he
hangs
up.
two
years
later,
an
indictment
is
found
against
john
brown
for
failure
to
report
for
induction
under
the
draft.
now,
the
crime
of
failing
to
report
for
induction
under
the
draft
is
done
publicly.
it's
in
a
place
where
many
people
are
present
and
the
person
simply
does
not
respond
to
the
call.
there
is
no
way
that
electronic
surveillance
can
lead
to
evidence
of
that
essentially
undisputed
fact.
in
due
course
however,
the
government
finds
that
a
conversation
of
john
brown
has
been
intercepted
in
connection
with
surveillance
activities.
well,
the
government
feels
obligated
to
disclose
this
fact
to
the
court
despite
the
fact
that
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
conversation
has
utterly
no
relevance
with
respect
to
our
connection
with
the
graft
prosecution.
yet,
to
disclose
the
conversation
to
the
defendant,
we
disclose
the
place,
time,
method,
and
object
of
the
surveillance,
the
disclosure
i
am
advised
but
simply
cannot
be
made
in
many
cases
of
this
type.
i
would
point
out
that
in
mr.
williams'
brief
in
this
case
according
from
a
transcript
made
in
another
case,
the
name
of
a
foreign
country
is
placed
in
print,
not
disposed
i
may
say
by
the
government
representative
in
that
case
but
by
the
court.
we've
accepted
the
fact
that
we
can't
make
this
determination
for
ourselves.
even
in
the
clearance
cases,
although
that's
undoubtedly
what
would
be
done
virtually
every
other
country
in
the
world.
we
do
submit
though
that
we've
met
our
responsibilities
and
that
the
competing
and
factors
involved
are
adequately
balanced
if
we
make
the
disclosure
to
the
judge.
if
he
determines
that
the
material
is
irrelevant,
no
further
disclosure
would
be
made
and
the
material
disclosed
to
him
would
be
sealed
to
be
made
available
to
the
appellate
court
for
review.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
determines
that
the
material
could
be
relevant.
note,
i
didn't
say
"is
relevant,"
but
"could
be
relevant,"
then
the
government
will
have
to
decide
in
such
a
case
whether
to
make
the
disclosure
to
the
defendant
in
this
counsel
or
as
is
more
likely
to
be
the
situation
for
national
securities
involved
to
dismiss
the
prosecution.
thirty
years
ago,
i
am
told
that
when
mr.
simpson,
oh
my,
it's
nearly
40
years
ago
became
secretary
of
state,
he
terminated
the
activities
in
the
state
department
by
which
there
was
surveillance
of
foreign
activities
saying
that
gentlemen
do
not
open
other
people's
mail.
but
in
1940,
under
different
conditions
and
under
president
roosevelt,
that
rule
has
been
changed.
i
would
hope
that
we
would
not
get
into
a
situation
where
the
united
states
has
its
arm
tied
behind
his
back
in
the
way
that
no
other
nation
has
and
i
think
that
the
interest
of
the
government
can
be
adequately
protected
and
the
interest
of
the
defendant
by
providing
for
disclosure
to
the
trial
court
in
cases
of
this
sort.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
give
you
speaking
in
constitutional
terms;
i
would
rely
on
the
power
of
the
president
to
carry
on
foreign
relations
and
the
power
and
responsibility
of
the
president
as
commander-in
chief
of
the
army
and
navy.
and
there
are
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
recognized
the
importance
of
these
powers
and
which
have
set
that
the
--
well,
for
example
in
kennedy
against
mendoza
martinez,
while
the
constitution
protects
against
invasions
of
individual
rights,
it
is
not
a
suicide
pact.
and
similarly
in
the
chicago
and
the
southern
airlines
case,
the
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
president,
both
as
commander-in-chief
and
as
the
nation's
organ
for
foreign
affairs,
has
available
intelligence
services
who's
reports
are
not
and
ought
not
to
be
published
to
the
world
and
it
is
because
of
these
powers
expressly
granted
by
the
constitution
which
in
my
submission
must
be
interpreted
together
with
the
fourth
amendment
which
does
not
forbid
all
searches
and
seizures
but
forbids
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
that
i
would
argue
that
in
this
case
where
we
are
not
seeking
to
bring
the
material
in
the
evidence
but
are
seeking
merely
to
show
that
it
has
no
conceivable
relationship
to
the
prosecution
that
the
determination
by
that
fact
by
the
independent
district
judge
adequately
protects
the
interest
of
the
defendant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
by
its
very
nature,
the
protective
order
cannot
protect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
a
substantial
part
of
the
distinction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
its
very
difficult
to
draw
the
line,
that
is
a
question
of
balance
in
this
case
when
the
materials
are
seen
by
the
district
judge,
it
will
be
perfectly
apparent
that
it
bears
no
relation
whatever
to
the
prosecution
when
the
alternative
is
that
it
either
must
be
disclose
in
effect
directly
to
the
foreign
nation
or
that
the
prosecution
must
be
dismissed.
it
seems
to
me
appropriate
to
draw
the
line
at
the
place
which
says
that
there
need
to
be
further
disclosure
when
there
has
been
an
independent
determination
by
the
district
judge
of
the
question
of
conceivable
relevance
particularly
when
that
type
of
question
of
relevance
is
one
which
judges
habitually
make
and
which
they
do
make
in
a
number
of
other
situations
which
though
not
the
same
of
course
are
analogous
to
this
such
as
those
under
the
jenks
act
with
respect
to
the
disclosure
of
grand
jury
minutes
discovery
of
evidence
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
that
say
again
a
difficult
question,
one
might
think
and
in
many
situations
one
could
say
that
it
should
be
before
the
trial.
on
the
other
hand
at
that
point,
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
judge
to
have
many
ideas
as
to
whether
the
material
is
relevant
to
what
will
be
brought
out
at
trial.
in
most
cases,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
best
to
have
the
disclosure
made
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
at
which
time
the
judge
knows
what
the
evidence
was
and
has
some
basis
for
determining
whether
it
had
any
source
in
the
material.
that
has
two
effects,
one
of
which
is
that
if
the
judge
decides
that
the
evidence
was
stated,
then
there
must
be
a
new
trial
but
the
other
is
that
because
of
that,
the
government
prosecutor
is
going
to
be
extremely
careful
to
see
that
he
does
not
introduce
evidence
which
can
be
regarded
as
tainted
because
he
does
not
want
to
go
through
the
process
of
having
a
trial
and
then
having
it
set
aside.
in
most
cases
therefore
it
would
be
my
view
that
as
in
this
case,
it
is
wiser,
better
judicial
administration
to
have
the
disclosure
made
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
rather
than
beforehand.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
so
mr.
justice
but
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
in
the
aggregate
can
be
a
very
serious
matter
--
in
the
national
security
area.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
reason
for
not
disclosing
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
is
a
very
considerable
harm.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
this
case
is
here
on
reargument
having
been
previously
presented
to
the
court
last
may
on
a
motion
made
by
the
government
to
modify
and
order
of
the
court
which
the
court
entered
in
january
of
this
year.
the
case
began
as
an
indictment
for
conspiracy
to
transmit
in
interstate
commerce
communications
contending
threats
and
design
to
injured
one
robert
sunshine
of
denver,
colorado.
there
were
originally
four
defendants,
one
was
acquitted
and
is
not
here.
the
other
three
defendants
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
one
of
them,
a
man
name
kolod
has
since
died
and
so
the
case
now
involves
the
two
messrs.
alderman
and
alderisio.
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
defendant
kolod
who
is
no
longer
here
sought
to
introduce
evidence
about
illegal
surveillance
at
the
dessert
inn
in
las
vegas,
nevada.
the
materials
were
submitted
to
the
trial
court
in
camera
and
it
was
held
that
they
were
not
relevant
and
that
evidence
with
respect
to
them
could
not
be
introduced.
thereafter,
while
the
case
was
pending
before
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
government
disclosed
that
it
had
additional
files
relating
to
conversations
overheard
at
the
dessert
inn.
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
examine
this
material
in
camera
and
that
court
found
nothing
admissible
in
the
additional
material.
thereafter,
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
the
convictions;
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
here
and
was
denied
in
october
1967.
now
i
should
make
it
plain
that
these
earlier
disclosures
of
surveillance
material
are
not
now
involved
since
kolod
has
died
and
they
related
only
to
him.
there's
nothing
now
before
the
court
relating
to
the
electronic
surveillance
material
which
was
considered
by
the
courts'
below.
we
now
have
a
wholly
new
problem,
i
mentioned
that
background
partly
to
avoid
misunderstanding
and
partly
because
that
issue
whether
consideration
by
the
court
in
camera
was
the
issue
which
was
presented
by
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
this
court
denied
in
october
1967.
following
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
a
counsel
for
alderman
and
alderisio
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
which
they
asserted
that
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
additional
surveillance
involving
the
defendant
alderisio.
in
response
to
that,
mr.
sprecher
then
acting
solicitor
general
filed
a
paper
with
the
court
in
which
he
said
that
pursuant
to
the
government's
policy,
it
had
been
determined
that
there
was
nothing
which
was
arguably
relevant
with
respect
to
the
prosecution.the
court
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
so
understood
it
and
the
fact
that
there
was
additional
surveillance.
i'm
trying
to
develop
the
chronology
by
which
the
case
came
along
and
mr.
sprecher's
statement
simply
was
that,
"the
department
had
determined
that
there
was
nothing
which
was
arguably
relevant."
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
that
the
court
entered
its
order
in
january
of
this
year
remanding
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
an
adversary
hearing
and
the
government
by
that
time
had
conceded
that
there
were
additional
results
of
electronic
surveillance.
it
was
following
that
order
of
the
court
that
the
present
motion
was
filed
which
is
a
motion
to
modify
the
order
of
the
court.
in
that
motion,
we
accept
without
question
of
any
sort
of
this
court's
decision
that
the
petitioners
here
are
entitled
to
the
independent
determination
of
a
court.
we
urge
however
that
this
should
be
done
in
the
first
instance
by
the
judge
in
camera
with
the
judge
then
being
created
to
order
such
further
proceedings
as
he
maybe
necessary
or
appropriate
as
a
result
of
his
examination.
this
is
the
procedure
i
would
point
out
which
was
followed
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
kolod's
surveillance
at
las
vegas.
this
was
directly
approved
by
the
court
below
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
similarly,
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
batalla
case
which
is
now
pending
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
has
sustained
such
a
procedure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
distress
myself,
all
i
can
say
is
that
at
anytime
when
it
is
become
known
to
me
that
there
has
been
such
an
action
prompt
disclosure
has
been
made.
this
is
a
problem
which
was
brewing
for
a
long
time.
we
--
there
are
clear
orders
of
the
attorney
general
effective
in
1965
that
it
should
not
be
done
except
in
national
security
matters
which
is
a
question
involved
in
the
next
two
cases
that's
not
involved
here.
there's
no
question
of
national
security
in
the
alderman
and
alderisio
cases.
i
have
found
nothing
in
my
tenure
in
the
department
of
justice
to
indicate
that
that
order
of
1965
has
there
been
in
anyway
violated
and
i
am
hoping
that
we
are
slowly
beginning
to
get
to
the
place
where
this
will
receive
into
the
background.
it
first
became
apparent
in
this
court
something
over
two
years
ago
in
the
case
of
black
against
the
united
states
where
the
then
solicitor
general
filed
a
memorandum
which
disclosed
electronic
surveillance.
at
that
time,
the
attorney
general
established
a
committee
in
the
department
of
justice
to
review
every
case
where
it
was
found
and
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
there
was
anything
which
was
arguably
irrelevant
and
to
make
disclosure
in
cases
where
there
was
anything
arguably
relevant.
this
is
the
procedure
which
the
court
has
found
to
be
inadequate
that
the
department
cannot
itself
make
that
determination
and
this
we
accept
without
question.
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
disclosure
must
be
made
either
in
public
or
to
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
under
protective
orders
or
whether
it
is
appropriate
in
these
cases
to
make
disclosure
first
into
the
district
judge.
now,
i
find
myself
with
some
feeling
that
we
have
made
this
matter
more
difficult
than
it
need
to
be.
i
don't
want
to
minimize
the
difficulties
this
has
been
a
very
worrisome
problem
for
a
long
time.
but
actually
there
a
sizeable
number
situations
where
the
procedure
is
established
that
determinations
of
relevance
may
be
made
by
the
district
judge
in
camera.
one
which
goes
back
quite
long
ways
is
the
materials
which
need
to
be
disclosed
in
response
to
a
subpoena
duces
tecum,
a
party
may
be
a
little
concerned
taking
that
certain
items
are
not
covered
by
the
subpoena
but
not
wanting
to
be
in
contempt
of
court
in
having
it
found
out
later
that
he
didn't
turned
into
something
which
turned
out
to
be
irrelevant
and
it
has
long
been
the
practice
that
in
such
a
case,
the
party
may
submit
an
item
to
the
court
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
it
is
within
the
scope
of
the
subpoena.
in
the
areas
of
discovery
under
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
this
court
has
specifically
authorized
a
procedure
under
which
the
material
is
shown
to
the
district
judge
in-camera
and
the
judge
determines
whether
it
is
irrelevant
or
not.
there
is
a
case
in
which
the
government
will
file
a
brief
in
opposition
today,
i
hope
that
i
would
have
the
printed
brief
here
now
but
the
government
printing
officer
has
not
delivered
it.
i've
just
made
a
proof
of
it
available
to
mr.
williams
and
it's
only
illustrated
but
it's
not
a
major
matter
but
it
was
a
case
involving
a
bank
robbery,
the
counsel
for
he
defendant
proceeding
under
the
brainy
decision
of
this
court
which
holds
that
exculpatory
material
held
by
the
government
must
be
disclosed
to
the
defense.
the
government
turned
over
a
substantial
amount
of
material
to
the
court
stating
in
its
belief
much
of
it
was
not
relevant
to
this
matter.
the
court
examined
it
and
turned
part
of
it
over
to
the
defense
and
refused
to
turn
over
the
other
parts
saying
that
they
were
no
way
relevant
and
the
identity
of
the
persons
whom
the
government
had
interviewed
should
not
be
disclosed
to
the
defense.
we
are
there
filing
our
brief
in
opposition
in
support
of
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
which
says
that
that
is
an
appropriate
procedure.
similarly,
under
the
jenks
statute,
it
is
specifically
provided
that
the
united
states
shall
deliver
it
by
the
statute
to
deliver
and
shall
deliver
a
statement
for
the
inspection
of
the
court
in
camera
and
upon
such
delivery,
the
court
shall
excise
the
portions
of
such
statement
which
do
not
relate
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
testimony
of
the
witness
and
deliver
the
balance
to
the
defense.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
there's
probably
some
distinction.
i'm
not
trying
to
suggest
that
any
of
these
are
conclusive,
i
am
trying
to
say
that
there
are
a
number
of
situations
where
the
determination
is
made
by
the
judge
in
camera
without
an
adversary
proceeding
and
i
think
that
there
are
arguments
which
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
that
should
be
the
procedure
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
i
don't
believe
there
is
in
any
of
them.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
issue
in
those
particular
cases
with
respect
to
the
protection
of
third
parties
as
there
is
in
the
fourth
of
these
that
i
was
going
to
present
which
is
the
matter
of
testimony
before
grand
juries
which
in
some
ways
has
a
good
deal
of
parallel
with
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
we
get
to
the
problem
of
standing
to
which
i'm
going
to
turn
in
a
moment,
the
court
may
say
that
the
person
who
is
seeking
to
have
this
material
suppressed
has
no
standing,
it
is
so.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
which
case
it
will
not
be
turned
back
but
the
matter
of
access
to
grand
jury
testimony
has
a
mild
parallel
with
what's
involved
here,
then
the
rule
was
for
a
long,
long
time
that
there
could
be
no
access
to
grand
jury
testimony.
it
was
secret.
proceedings
of
grand
juries
were
secret.
the
court
has
broken
that
down
in
the
dennis
case
and
in
other
decisions
but
in
the
process,
it
recognized
that
it
was
not
appropriate
simply
to
turnover
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
to
the
defendant.
the
court
has
explicitly
decided
that
the
district
judge
should
examine
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
and
should
not
turnover
evidence
which
is
not
--
should
not
turn
over
a
testimony
in
the
minutes
which
is
not
relevant
to
the
particular
issue
with
which
the
defense
is
concerned
at
the
time
and
has
specifically
referred
to
the
fact
of
the
necessity
of
protecting
not
only
other
witnesses
but
also
third
parties
whose
names
might
have
been
mentioned
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings
but
who
perhaps
were
not
indicted
for
one
reason
or
another
and
that
is
done
by
the
judge
ex
parte.
now,
it
also
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
we
have
considered
this
problem
in
two
broad
a
way
and
in
that
respect,
i
found
some
passages
in
mr.
williams'
brief
which
seem
to
me
to
be
quite
relevant.
on
page
five
of
his
brief,
he
says
if
the
fbi
had
ransack
petitioner's
alderisio's
home
and
taken
his
private
papers
without
warrant
or
other
process
could
it
decline
to
produce
them
in
court.
well,
that
has
seems
to
narrow
the
contention
to
his
which
would
be
specifically
alderisio's
own
conversations
and
if
we
narrow
this
proceeding
simply
to
those
portions
of
transcripts
which
contained
conversations
to
which
alderisio
was
a
party
on
one
side
or
another.
we
have
already
excluded
a
considerable
part
of
the
material.
and
then
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
am
saying
that
if
we
--
i'm
trying
to
narrow
the
issue
to
that.
i
would
still
like
to
have
some
ground
to
stand
on
to
say
that
even
in
such
cases
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
judge
to
say
that
it
is
irrelevant.
but
if
the
contention
is
limited
simply
to
alderisio's
own
conversations,
the
problem
is
a
good
deal
easier.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
regard
it
as
bound
by
that
statement.
i
just
notice
that
as
i
was
reading
it.
there
are
other
passages
to
which
i
refer
which
seem
to
me
to
be
parallel
with
that.
similarly
on
page
16
and
17
of
his
brief,
he
refers
to
the
proceedings
in
the
local
court,
i
believe
in
the
black
case
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
16
on
top
of
page
17,
he
says,
"based
upon
further
proving
and
further
argument,
the
court
made
some
limited
excisions
with
principally
of
material
in
the
airtel
memorandum
which
had
which
had
a
live
informant
source."
now,
i
would
simply
point
out
that
in
that
case,
some
part
of
it
has
been
held
to
be
irrelevant
then
i
don't
regard
that
as
a
great
importance
but
on
page
22
of
his
brief,
the
last
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
errant
gossip
rationale
is
quickly
disposed
of
if
we
consider
that
the
petitioners
themselves
either
heard
or
made
the
scandalous
references
to
third
parties
other
while
they
were
present.
now,
that
seems
to
narrow
the
contention
to
conversations
of
which
the
defendants
here
were
parties
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
this
gets
me
to
the
issue
of
standing
which
was
raised
in
the
orders
setting
the
case
down
for
rehearing.
that
problem
presents
some
difficulties
and
embarrassments
for
counsel
who
are
representing
the
government
and
cases
of
this
sort.
i
think
the
difficulty
and
embarrassment
of
mr.
alexander
who
was
appearing
in
the
district
court
here
are
apparent
on
pages
14
and
15,
the
problem
is
that
if
you
could
only
disclose
this
material,
you
could
show
how
utterly
irrelevant
it
is.
but
if
you
disclosed
it,
you
have
defeated
the
whole
objective
of
trying
not
to
disclose
it.
now,
i
think
it
can
be
said
that
we
have
made
rightly
or
wrongly
a
sort
of
a
compromise
in
this
case.
we
have
made
what
amounts
to
a
partial
disclosure.
i
had
a
good
deal
of
concern
before
we
went
that
far
but
i
thought
we
had
to.
in
the
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
of
our
brief,
we
have
stated
our
understanding
of
the
situation
here
which
is
one
that
there
were
no
overhearings
whatever
of
mr.
alderman.
there
is
no
information
with
respect
to
mr.
alderman
and
that
with
respect
to
mr.
alderisio
we
have
in
effect
disclosed
the
places
where
the
overhearing
was.
they
were
overheard
on
premises
which
were
not
his
but
were
business
establishments
owned
by
associates
of
his
or
firms
that
employed
him
and
where
he
did
not
have
desk
space.
similarly,
in
another
case
which
is
appending
before
the
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari,
we
have
disclosed
the
approximate
times
of
the
overhearings
in
an
effort
to
show
that
they
could
not
have
been
relevant.
now,
with
respect
to
alderman,
whose
conversations
were
not
heard
and
whose
premises
were
not
affected,
it
is
our
position
that
he
has
no
standing
to
object
into
the
evidence
to
the
failure
to
disclose
with
respect
to
conversations
of
alderisio.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
anything
here
which
led
to
other
evidence
whether
any
evidence
which
was
used
against
alderman
was
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
and
if
our
position
is
that
even
though
it
was
illegal
with
respect
to
alderisio,
even
though
there
must
be
disclosure
with
respect
to
alderisio
that
alderman
has
no
standing
to
raise
that
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
that
may
have
produced
the
evidence
which
was
admissible
against
alderman.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
wong
sun
would
be
i
think
the
closest
case
that
is
in
371
u.s.
i
think
to
some
extent,
it's
inherent
in
the
jones
case
which
refers
to
the
person
aggrieved
alderman
is
not
aggrieved
by
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
that's
what
they
were
with
respect
to
other
persons.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
they
are
co-conspirators,
yes.
that
is,
that
is
in
effect
wong
sun.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
would
be
our
position
that
if
there
were
conversations
to
third
parties
when
alderisio
was
not
present
that
he
would
have
no
standing
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
gets
harder.
i
think
there
that
we
might
say
that
he
has
standing
but
we
still
have
the
issue
of
relevance
which
we
contend
should
be
determined
by
the
district
judge
in
camera.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
his
presence
i
suppose.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
there's
very
much
foundation.
i
don't
know
just
where
the
fine
is.
i
don't
know
just
exactly
what
the
basis
of
standing
is.
it
seems
to
shift
and
erode
from
time
to
time.
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
that
if
the
conversation
was
overheard
at
a
time
when
he
was
present
that
he
has
no
standing.
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
i
shall
not
be
sorry.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
is
my
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
it
was
not
his
place
of
business?
i
would
think
it
was
greatly
reduced
of
the
scope
of
his
claim
to
have
standing.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
he
was
--
if
there
are
conversations
of
his
and
to
get
back
to
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
there
were
conversations
made
while
he
was
present,
certainly
if
there
were
conversations
of
his,
he
would
have
standing,
if
there
are
conversation
made
while
he
was
present,
i
find
it
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
isn't
clear
to
me
in
the
case
where
he
is
present
but
did
not
participate
where
he
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
then
it
is
only
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
it
comes
within
the
casual
in
some
way
or
another
and
i
find
a
little
difficulty
in
seeing
that
the
catch
rule
applies
to
a
conversation
on
the
street
corner
and
it's
clear
to
me
that
you
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
think
when
you're
in
a
room
you
are
somewhat
closer
to
the
situation
involved
in
katz
where
you
have
some
expectation
that
what
you
hear
will
not
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
be
closer
to
a
telephone
booth.
the
one
point
to
which
i
have
not
referred
is
simply
why
are
we
concerned
and
that
of
course
relates
to
conversations
of
third
persons
and
in
particular,
conversations
which
were
heard
when
alderisio
was
not
present
where
we
think
they
are
entitled
to
some
protection.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
not
have
supposed
that
it
would
have
been
suggested
that
this
was
not
a
case
involving
the
national
security.
the
fact
is
that
butenko
is
an
american
citizen
was
employed
by
the
international
electronic
company
which
was
under
contract
with
the
air
force
to
produce
a
command
and
control
system
for
the
strategic
air
command.
the
system
includes
data
processing
and
computer
programming
equipment
designed
to
store
and
transmit
operational
information
such
as
the
location
of
aircraft
and
distances
from
targets
which
will
enable
the
commander
of
the
strategic
air
command
to
alert
and
execute
all
these
forces
at
extremely
rapid
rate
and
provide
him
with
up
to
the
minute
information
on
the
status
of
the
total
force.
the
information
supplied
by
the
system
may
be
provided
either
as
a
picture
projected
on
a
screen
or
printed
page
form
and
butenko
who
had
top
secret
clearance
was
the
control
administrator
for
the
projects
field
operations
division
with
complete
clearance
and
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
he
turned
over
materials
to
a
foreign
country.
now,
it's
true
that
the
phrase
national
security
can
be
use
loosely.
it
can
be
use
for
example
to
relate
to
efforts
to
combat
organized
crime
and
things
of
that
sort
as
we
have
used
it
in
these
cases
that
relate
solely
to
relations
with
foreign
nations
and
to
efforts
to
guard
against
espionage
and
to
protect
military
and
national
secrets
of
the
united
states.
i
would
emphasize
again
that
we
are
not
in
this
case
seeking
to
argue
that
the
evidence
is
admissible
although
i
can
conceive
of
cases
as
for
example
if
information
is
obtained
that
there
is
a
ship
on
the
high
seas
which
contains
a
nuclear
device
which
when
the
ship
gets
to
new
york
harbor,
it
is
going
to
be
exploded
and
by
virtue
of
the
very
effective
and
determined
detective
skill,
it
is
not
only
found
where
the
ship
is
but
it
is
also
found
that
it
was
being
brought
here
by
group
of
americans
who
were
seeking
to
takeover
the
government.
at
some
point,
it
sees
to
me
there
ought
to
be
freedom
to
argue
that
whatever
method
was
used
to
obtain
evidence
with
respect
to
that
transaction
is
not
an
unreasonable
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
if
it
is
done
by
united
states
activities
by
officers
of
the
united
states,
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
argue
with
the
fourth
amendment
whatever
it
means.
it's
not
applicable
to
those
officers
of
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
suppose
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
yes
mr.
justice,
i
suppose
that
a
court
martial
trial
in
germany
is
governed
by
the
fifth
amendment
--
a
court
martial
trial
in
the
united
states
--
of
the
united
states
military
person
if
it
is
an
effort
to
exercise
the
force
or
power
of
the
united
states.
now
that
power
is
limited
by
the
fifth
amendment
and
by
the
fourth
amendment,
i
would
assume.
anyway,
we
don't
have
that
involved
here,
the
evidence
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
never
got
to
stay
far
enough
away
so
that
they
could
move
in
after
they
can
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
wouldn't
regard
as
different
from
this.
the
question
is
what
is
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure
and
i
think
reasonable
has
to
be
construed
in
the
light
of
all
the
facts
or
circumstances.
mr.
danzig
has
talked
about
how
nefarious
the
government
is
in
these
places.
all
i
can
say
is
that
five
persons
and
10
attorney
general
have
regarded
it
as
appropriate,
legitimate
and
necessary
to
do
what
is
--
has
been
done
here
and
anyone
who
carries
a
responsibility
of
protecting
the
people
of
this
country
against
possible
foreign
attack
will
recognize
the
need
to
be
very
thorough
and
comprehensive
in
that
task.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
would
think
that's
a
way
of
putting
it
with
the
only
crime
that
is
enormous
enough,
it
seems
to
me
would
be
massive
treason,
massive
destruction
of
people
and
property
of
the
country.
i
would
not
make
it
applicable
to
any
ordinary
crime.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
depends
on
how
big
the
mass
is
if
it's
by
nuclear
weapons
i
might
be
willing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
that
i
am
trying
to
do
mr.
justice
is
to
reserve
what
the
future
with
respect
to
a
case
that
the
awful
facts
of
which
i
cannot
now
imagine.
the
right
to
contend
that
very
vigorous
and
thorough
activities
made
by
the
people
responsible
for
protecting
the
country
are
not
such
as
to
prevent
the
evidence
obtained
by
those
activities
from
being
admitted
into
evidence.
we
are
not
making
any
such
argument
here.
we
are
not
contending
that
any
evidence
obtained
by
these
methods
or
any
evidence
which
was
produced
from
a
lead
obtained
from
this
evidence
of
these
methods
is
admissible
in
this
case.
we
are
arguing
here
simply
that
in
a
situation
where
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
electronic
surveillance
had
no
relation
whatever
to
the
evidence
produced
at
the
trial
that
we
should
be
free
to
establish
that
fact
for
the
united
states
district
judge
without
its
being
disclose
not
merely
to
the
defendant
but
as
an
inevitable
in
the
case
of
this
sort
to
the
other
nation
which
may
be
involved.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
may
i
say
in
personal
answer
to
that,
what
was
done
in
the
katz
case
was
legal
when
it
was
done.
it
only
became
illegal
as
result
of
the
katz
decision
itself.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
produced.
it
was
within
decision
of
the
court
itself
standing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
true
that
during
the
past
summer,
congress
has
enacted
the
statute
which
expressly
excludes
national
security
situations
or
expressly
authorizes
the
surveillance
and
national
security
situation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
in
quite
broad
term
mr.
justice
when
authorize
by
the
attorney
--
mr.
chief
justice
when
authorize
by
the
attorney
general.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
what
your
question,
great
many
things
happened
prior
to
1965,
many
things
which
i
regret,
many
things
which
have
cost
great
difficulties
for
me
and
through
us
for
the
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
since
1965,
the
requirements
have
been
very
clear
and
very
specific,
there
is
no
eavesdropping
or
bugging
whatever
since
1965
and
no
case
were
there
has
been
any
evidence
whatever
that
there
has
been
bugging
or
eavesdropping
except
in
the
cases
of
national
security.
the
passage
in
the
act
to
pass
by
congress
this
summer,
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
is
on
page
7
of
our
brief
in
ivanov
and
butenko.
nothing
contained
in
this
chapter
or
in
section
605
of
the
communications
act
shall
limit
the
constitutional
power
of
the
president
to
take
such
measure
as
he
deemed
necessary,
to
protect
the
nation
against
actual
or
potential
attack
or
other
hostile
acts
of
a
foreign
power
to
obtain
foreign
intelligence
information
deemed
to
central
for
the
security
of
the
united
states
or
to
protect
national
security
information
against
foreign
intelligence
activities.
and
all
that
we
would
contend
for
would
be
a
decision
here
which
would
leave
that
statement
by
congress
in
effective
operation
and
if
there
has
to
be
disclosure
of
merely
incidental
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
counsel
in
the
other
side
quite
appropriately
contended
in
terms
of
methods
of
material
and
inevitable
connection
with
the
case
involved.
the
fact
is
that
in
a
number
of
these
situations,
people
just
wander
in
to
a
surveillance.
it's
perfectly
incidental,
perfectly
accidental,
perfectly
obvious
that
nothing
out
of
it
has
any
relation
to
the
subsequent
and
wholly
unrelated
crime.
we
have
felt
that
whenever
the
name
appears
that
we
must
make
disclosure
to
this
court
as
we
have
what
we
do
feel
that
the
details
that
the
defendant
can
be
adequately
protected
if
the
details
are
disclose
to
the
district
judge
and
he
can
determine
that
nothing
happened
which
was
arguably
relevant
to
the
particular
prosecution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
understand
that
the
recent
act
of
congress
necessarily
controls
these
cases.
i
know
nothing
in
it
which
is
formally
retroactive,
i
would
suppose
that
the
decision
made
in
this
case
would
have
to
be
one
fashioned
by
this
court
out
of
the
materials
which
are
available
to
court
which
would
include
the
several
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
i
point
out
several
because
it's
not
only
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
also
the
powers
granted
to
the
president.
the
long
continued
practice
which
goes
back
to
the
origins
of
the
republic
undoubtedly
to
the
necessities
of
the
situation,
to
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
and
when
all
of
these
are
taken
into
account,
i
think
you
are
confronted
with
a
balancing
consideration
between
the
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
are
not
absolute.
they
provide
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
we've
long
been
guarded
and
long
been
warned
against
the
pressing
constitutional
doctrines
to
their
logical
extreme
and
when
you
take
into
account
all
of
the
factors
involved
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
come
up
with
an
appropriate
construction
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
circumstances
in
this
case
which
will
adequately
protect
the
rights
of
the
defendant
by
providing
for
disclosure
in
the
first
instance
to
the
district
judge.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
i
think
not
mr.
justice
but
i
think
it
is
on
disclosure
to
the
district
judge
by
the
district
judge
himself.
i
don't
think
you'll
get
to
it
because
he
will
immediately
see
that
there
is
nothing
which
is
by
any
conceivable
stretch
of
imagination
relevant
to
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
might
get
a
more
limited
disclosure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
turns
out
with
a
standing
proposition,
we
--
you
may
have
to
have
more
separate
trials
when
you
know
that
in
advance
in
which
case
there
might
not
be
any
disclosure
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
i
think
that
would
be
our
position.
no
matter
what
rule
the
court
makes,
there's
known
to
be
an
area
where
the
government
is
going
to
have
exercise
some
kind
of
judgment.
