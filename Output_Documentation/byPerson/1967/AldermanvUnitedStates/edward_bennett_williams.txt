mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
outset
i
would
like
to
make
an
analysis
if
i
may
of
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
this
motion.
i'm
afraid
a
fairly
hostile
analysis
because
i'm
concerned
that
the
sheer
proliferation
of
instances
of
microphone
surveillance
that
have
come
to
light
in
last
year
or
so
have
began
to
dull
our
capacity
for
indignation,
at
the
practice,
at
its
consequences
and
at
government's
position
with
respect
to
it.
from
the
papers
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
we
readily
conclude
that
petitioner
had
his
premises
under
electronic
surveillance
for
a
non-disclosed
indeterminate
amount
of
time.
that
a
device
was
placed
on
his
business
premises
for
the
purpose
of
picking
up
his
private
conversations
for
an
indeterminate
length
of
time.
and
we
further
can
conclude
that
in
fact
his
private
conversations
were
picked
up
over
an
indeterminate
period
of
time
and
they
were
recorded.
logs,
memoranda
and
records
were
made
of
those
conversations
which
are
now
in
the
possession
of
the
government.
we
can
further
conclude
that
of
course
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
have
been
violated
by
agents
of
the
government.
and
we
can
further
conclude
that
in
doing
these
acts,
agents
of
the
government
transgressed
the
criminal
statutes
of
the
united
states
because
title
18
of
section
241
makes
it
a
crime
to
injure
any
citizen
in
the
enjoyment
and
the
exercise
of
his
constitutional
rights,
it
makes
it
a
crime
punishable
by
a
term
of
imprisonment
up
to
10
years
and
a
fine
of
$5,000.
and
we
can
conclude
further,
because
this
court
can
judicially
notice
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
agents
of
the
government
in
cavalier
fashion
violated
the
statutes
of
illinois
because
there
is
a
very
stringent
eavesdropping
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
amenable
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
perpetrator,
to
eavesdrop
by
an
electronic
device
for
the
purpose
of
overhearing
the
private
conversations
of
a
citizen.
this
court,
beginning
14
years
ago,
put
the
spoken
word
within
the
penumbra
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
did
it
for
the
first
time
in
irvine
against
california
back
in
1954.
that's
repeatedly
said
so
in
silverman
in
1961,
in
wong
sun
in
1963
and
twice
last
year
in
burger
and
katz.
so
that
agents
of
the
government
have
taken
seized
illicitly
on
constitutionally
and
i
say
even
criminally
the
private
conversations
of
this
petitioner.
and
they
hold
records,
logs
and
memoranda
of
those
conversations
in
their
possession
now
but
they
say
that
petitioner
should
not
have
access
to
that
store
of
information.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
they
seized
conversations
of
other
persons,
persons
other
than
the
petitioner
at
a
time
when
he
was
not
present
on
his
own
premises,
i
suggest
sir,
that
they
violated
his
constitutional
rights
because
the
planting
of
an
electronic
device
by
necessity
requires
a
trespass.
it
requires
perhaps
a
burglary.
in
illinois,
it
would
require
a
burglary
because
it
would
be
an
illegal
entry
for
the
purpose
of
committing
a
crime
and
therefore
he
would
have
a
constitutional
standing
to
suppress
any
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
that
illegal
conduct.
in
order
intelligently
to
exercise
his
right
to
suppress,
he
must
know
and
therefore
i
say,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
right
to
privacy
of
the
third
and
fourth
party
must
yield
to
his
constitutional
right
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
have
a
constitutional
right
against
government
surveillance
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
which
has
been
abrogated
by
the
government
here.
they
do
not
have
a
right
superior
to
the
petitioner's
constitutional
right
to
prevent
him
from
learning
what
was
said
on
those
premises.
and
we
need
have
no
fear
mr.
justice
stewart,
concerning
that
because
in
the
first
instance
the
petitioners
themselves
will
ask
the
court
for
protective
orders
so
that
their
privacy
will
not
be
further
invaded
then
it
already
has
been
by
the
action
of
the
government.
and
protective
orders
can
be
issued
under
rule
16
for
the
benefit
of
those
third
parties
who
are
on
petitioners'
premises
who
conversed
between
themselves
and
who
would
like
to
have
their
privacy
protected
to
the
full
extent.
i
suggest
that
the
government's
position
on
this
matter
is
really
vacuous
because
it
is
asking
this
court
to
formulate
a
rule;
it
is
asking
this
court
to
formulate
a
policy
predicated
on
the
fact
that
the
trial
judges
are
unable
to
enforce
compliance
with
their
own
orders.
it's
asking
this
court
further
to
formulate
a
policy
predicated
on
the
fact
that
the
miscreant
eavesdropper
has
a
greater
interest
in
the
privacy
of
the
victim
than
their
victim
has.
i
suggest
that
all
the
safeguards
that
we're
concerned
about
that
the
solicitor's
--
general
has
expressed
himself
on
can
be
taken
cared
of
by
protective
orders
under
rule
16
for
those
persons.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
basic
application
of
principle
fundamental
toward
jurisprudence
equal
justice
under
the
law
would
require
--
and
we
don't
ask
for
this
and
it's
never
been
done.
it
would
require
even
a
prosecution
of
the
eavesdroppers
under
the
statutes
which
they
have
violated.
but
the
basic
rules
of
law,
logic,
reason
and
decency
certainly
require
them
to
make
restitution
to
the
victim,
to
put
the
victim
back
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
status
quo
if
they
had
gone
in
to
his
office
and
had
burglarized
his
correspondence
and
made
off
with
it,
could
the
government
be
heard
to
say
we
shall
return
only
such
of
his
correspondence
as
his
germane
to
the
pending
case
against
him?
could
they
say
that?
is
that
a
defensible
position
legally
or
morally?
i
suggest
that
is
not.
can
they
do
this?
can
they
go
in
and
listen
for
months
and
months
to
the
conversations
of
an
american
citizen?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
katz's
position
would
be
wholly
untenable
in
my
view
mr.
justice
fortas
because
he's
not
talking
about
his
own
premises
when
he
talks
about
the
use
of
a
public
telephone
by
someone
other
than
himself.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
am
saying
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'm
saying
that
the
petitioner's
office,
his
business
premises
were
invaded
unconstitutionally
and
illegally
and
he
has
the
rights
to
the
fruits
of
that
trespass
and
if
the
fruits
of
that
trespass
happens
to
be
the
conversations
of
two
persons
other
than
himself,
i
suggest
that
he
has
a
right
in
order
to
exercise
his
motion
to
suppress
intelligently
to
know
what
they
say
and
he
should
received
it.
i
would
be
the
first
to
say,
under
a
protective
order
that
would
safeguard
them
to
the
maximum
but
would
still
preserve
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
would
safeguard
the
persons
who
engaged
in
the
conversation.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
would
safeguard
them
from
disclosure
other
than
to
the
defendant
and
it
would
safeguard
them
from
disclosures
other
than
we're
absolutely
necessary
in
an
adversary
proceeding
designed
to
protect
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
defendant.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
and
as
i
indicated
earlier
the
petitioner
will
ask
for
such
an
order
because
the
petitioner
is
not
anxious
to
have
his
own
privacy
further
invaded.
and
so
he
will
ask
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
will
--
he
would
trust
his
counsel
but
he
might
not
trust
the
opposition
with
respect
to
the
conversations
that
are
disclosed
because
experience
has
taught
us
that
the
miscreant
eavesdropper
becomes
more
cavalier
with
respects
to
his
leaks
from
his
warehouse
of
stolen
privacy
after
it
has
been
released
to
the
victim.
so
that
there
is
a
reason
for
asking
for
such,
there
is
a
reason
for
asking
for
such
a
protective
order.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir,
a
neighborly
policeman,
if
the
court
please.
now,
with
respect
to
the
position
of
the
government
in
which
they
urged
the
court
that
this
really
is
not
anything
new,
this
is
really
an
old
traditional
way
of
handling
this
problem.
they
say
why
the
courts
have
been
handling
this
problem
in
jencks
materials
and
in
the
case
of
grand
jury
minutes
for
a
long
time
and
that's
all
we're
asking.
well,
i
think
there
are
two
very,
very
dramatic
differences
between
jencks
materials
on
the
one
hand
grand
jury
minutes
and
the
logs,
memoranda
and
records
of
electronically
eavesdropped
conversations.
the
first
is,
the
government
has
a
right
to
the
jencks
material
because
they
obtained
them
lawfully.
they
have
a
right
to
the
grand
jury
minutes
because
they
obtained
the
grand
jury
minutes
lawfully
and
when
a
defendant
comes
in
and
he
asked
for
a
jencks
materials
or
grand
jury
minutes,
he's
asking
for
something
that
belongs
to
the
government
to
which
he
has
no
right
unless
it
is
germane
to
his
guilt
or
innocence.
we're
not
talking
about
that,
we
are
talking
about
something
the
government
has
no
right.
they
have
no
right
to
his
private
conversations.
they
have
no
right
to
have
invaded
his
privacy
of
communication
and
he
is
asking
for
something
to
be
returned
that
belongs
to
him
and
that's
the
difference
between
jencks
act
materials,
grand
jury
materials
and
the
logs
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
depending
upon
how
long
he
has
a
lease
to
that
room,
i
would
say
that
he
has
a
right
and
a
standing
to
object
to
transgressions
on
the
privacy
of
that
(voice
overlap)
on
that
room.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
now,
mr.
y
you
say
has
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
does
not
rent
the
room?
mr.
y
is
a
pure
invitee
and
he
has
standing
there
only
during
the
life
of
his
invitation
then
i
would
say
that
his
rights
are
circumscribed
by
the
extent
of
his
invitation
and
when
he's
there
present,
he
would
have
the
right
to
his
conversations
and
those
conversations
of
the
persons
who
were
there
with
him
present
at
his
invitation
but
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
but
i
would
take
the
opposite
position
with
respect
to
the
man
who
has
the
lease
on
the
room
because
a
whole
different
set
of
principles
come
into
play.
he
is
complaining
about
a
trespass
against
premises
which
he
rented.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
now,
let's
settle
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
so
that
we
have
our
nomenclature
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
x
the
lessor
of
the
room?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
lessee?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
lessee?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
i
say
yes
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
x
is
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
and
there
has
been
a
trespass
by
the
agents
of
the
government
against
his
room,
there
has
been
the
planting
of
electronic
device
in
his
room
then
i
say
the
government
may
not
profit
against
him
in
its
prosecution
by
its
own
misconduct,
by
its
own
criminal
conduct,
by
its
own
burglary
that
in
order
for
him
to
suppress
that
which
is
been
gained
as
a
result
of
that
trespass
or
burglary,
its
necessary
for
him
to
know
under
a
protective
order
what
was
gleaned
thereby.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
saying
he
has
the
right
to
know,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
right.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir,
exactly
and
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
until
you
look
at
it.
and
i
say
this
with
respect
to
the
position
urged
by
the
solicitor
general,
in
which
he
would
advocate
the
judges
looking
at
this
material
in
determining
what
of
it
should
be
given
to
the
petitioner.
i'll
take
second
place
to
no
one
in
my
respect
for
the
courage,
the
independence,
the
objectivity
and
the
fairness
of
the
federal
trial
bench
in
this
country
but
without
as
a
preface,
i
say
respectfully
that
the
trial
judges
are
not
equipped
or
qualified
to
do
this
job.
they
can't
do
it.
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
determine
what
has
been
relevant
to
a
prosecution.
we
all
know
it's
been
said
a
hundred
times
i
suppose
that
a
criminal
prosecution
is
--
the
old
metaphors
it's
like
an
iceberg,
one
eight
of
it
shows
and
the
layers
know
the
seventh
eights
it's
under
water.
where
the
trial
judge
is
determining
whether
jencks
material
is
relevant,
he
has
just
heard
the
witness
testify
on
direct
examination.
now
he
juxtapose
as
a
sheaf
of
papers
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
what
he
reads
in
the
jencks
material
and
the
direct
testimony
and
he
can
do
that.
even
with
respect
to
grand
jury
testimony
he
may
with
diligence
take
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
read
it
carefully,
juxtapose
it
against
the
direct
testimony
of
the
witness
whom
he
has
just
heard
and
make
a
determination
that
there
is
something
useful
there
to
the
defense
but
we're
not
talking
about
that.
we're
not
talking
about
sheaves
of
material,
we
are
talking
in
--
as
our
paper
show,
we
are
talking
about
electronic
surveillances
which
have
produced
cases
of
material.
is
the
judge
to
be
handed
cases
of
logs
and
memoranda
and
as
he
was
in
one
case
and
had
to
delegate
part
of
the
responsibility
to
another
judge
and
take
four
and
half
weeks
to
read
it.
is
he
to
do
that
and
try
to
determine
what
is
relevant
to
the
skeleton
of
an
indictment
because
in
most
instances,
these
motions
will
be
before
trial?
let's
assume
it
was
an
income
tax
case.
the
standard
indictment
in
an
income
tax
case
today
is
the
words
of
the
statute,
a
number
and
a
year.
if
its
a
net
worth
case
and
if
there
has
been
an
electronic
surveillance
of
the
taxpayer
for
three
of
four
months,
and
if
the
trial
judge
is
handed
a
room
full
of
materials,
how
in
the
name
of
reason
is
he
going
to
determine
what
is
relevant
to
that
case.
only
the
counsel
and
his
client
can
make
that
determination.
why?
because
the
way
it's
done,
if
the
court
please,
supposing
the
taxpayer
had
a
telephone
conversation
with
his
lady
friend
to
use
the
same
illustration
as
was
used
earlier,
as
the
result
of
the
lead
from
that
conversation
the
lady
friend
will
be
interviewed
and
as
a
result
of
that,
ffurriers
and
jewelers
and
perhaps
automobile
salesman
will
be
unearthed.
they
will
show
up
as
witnesses
at
the
trial.
there
will
be
nothing
to
suggest
that
that
lead
came
from
what
might
have
been
an
innocuous
conversation
with
his
ex-lady
friend.
and
how
it
would
be
concealed,
it
will
be
concealed
in
the
most
interesting
clandestine
and
surreptitious
way
because
the
nomenclature
in
the
lexicon
of
the
eavesdroppers
is
confidential
informant.
as
the
result
of
a
disclosure
from
a
confidential
informant,
we
interviewed
c,
the
ex-lady
friend
of
the
suspect
and
we
found
out
the
following
so
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
judge
is
going
to
know
that
this
evidence
has
been
unearthed
as
a
result
of
an
electronic
eavesdropping
device.
and
in
fact
as
we
point
out
in
our
papers,
government
counsel
themselves
have
been
beguiled
by
this
tactic
and
have
stood
up
in
good
conscience
and
in
good
faith
and
made
misrepresentations
to
the
court
with
respect
to
the
source
of
their
evidence.
why,
because
the
eavesdropper
conceals
his
illegality
and
his
illicit
conduct
and
he
does
it
with
a
standard
investigative
nomenclature
confidential
informant
discloses.
furthermore,
we
have
shown
illustrations
where
the
monitor
in
charge
of
the
case
has
been
more
sophisticated
than
to
reduce
this
to
writing.
instead,
he
monitors
the
electronic
device.
he
listens
for
leads
and
then
that
evening
he
calls
in
the
field
and
he
tells
the
field
agents
go
check
this
out.
go
check
this
out.
check
this
out.
the
field
agent
is
kept
completely
in
the
dark.
he
never
knows
that
the
lead
was
born
from
a
tainted
source
and
that
the
evidence
which
he
is
unearthing
is
polluted
and
he
is
prepared
to
come
in
and
say,
well,
i
developed
this
lead
from
a
perfectly
lawful
source
and
i
did
it
as
a
result
of
an
instruction
from
my
superior.
when
the
superior
is
then
called
to
the
stand
to
find
out
where
he
got
his
lead,
he
has
the
cloak
of
confidential
informant
and
the
bug
is
not
unearth
and
i
suggest
that
only
counsel,
counsel
with
his
dedication
to
his
plan
will
lead
all
that
material
and
who
knows
the
facts
and
who
knows
the
case
from
beginning
to
end
can
do
the
job
of
determining
what
is
relevant
and
what
is
germane
and
what
leads
were
unearthed
with
respect
to
the
prosecution
(voice

--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
comes
very
critical
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
sir,
i
wouldn't.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
would
readily
concede
mr.
justice
white
that
when
counsel
has
access
to
the
conversations
that
were
illegally
picked
up
as
a
result
of
this
microphone
surveillance
on
his
client,
he
is
going
to
find
irrelevant
materials
but
i
say
that
only
counsel
and
the
petitioner
can
make
that
determination
properly.
it
cannot
be
made
by
the
trial
judge.
there
is
no
way
that
the
trial
judge
can
make
that
kind
of
determination.
now,
i
suggest
that
this
problem
was
dealt
with
18
years
ago.
the
exact
problem
was
dealt
with
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
speaking
through
judge
learned
hand
in
the
united
states
against
kaplan.
it
is
in
--
on
all
force
with
this
case
except
that
it
had
the
additional
factor
of
having
national
security
overtones.
and
in
that
instance
where
there
was
wiretapping,
the
trial
judge
had
all
of
the
materials
turned
over
to
him
in
camera
and
he
of
coursed
released
much
of
that
material
to
the
defendant
and
her
counsel
but
he
made
an
in
camera
determination
that
a
large
portion
of
it
was
irrelevant
and
he
did
that
on
the
ground
that
the
national
security
was
involved
and
that
was
the
representation
that
was
made
to
him
by
counsel
for
the
government.
that
case
went
to
the
circuit
and
of
course
it
was
overturned,
it
was
reversed
and
the
court
found
that
there
was
error
there
of
constitutional
dimensions
and
the
court
reversed
the
case
and
sent
it
back
for
a
retrial
that
never
took
place.
now,
that
case
to
my
knowledge
and
i
say
this
without
serious
fear
of
contradiction
has
never
been
assailed
buy
the
untied
states
government
in
the
eighteen
years
of
its
life.
it's
been
cited
with
approbation
by
this
court.
i
have
heard
it
distinguished
many
times
but
i
have
never
heard
it
assails
such
as
it
has
been
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
this
case
because
the
government
now
takes
the
position
that
the
second
circuit
court
speaking
through
judge
learned
hand
decided
the
case
of
kaplan
against
the
united
states
erroneously.
i
say
if
the
court
please,
that
the
root
of
the
question
post
by
the
government's
motion
is
this,
is
it
alright
for
the
government
to
say
to
one
of
its
citizens
even
with
the
approbation
of
a
federal
district
judge,
we
have
had
a
faceless
informer
in
your
house
furlough
these
many
months
and
we
have
listened
to
you
conversations
and
we
have
recorded
those
conversations
and
we
have
them
in
logs,
in
memoranda
and
records
in
our
warehouse
of
stolen
privacy
but
be
of
good
cheer
because
we
have
examined
them
and
we
find
nothing
significant
to
this
pending
case
so
for
the
moment
you
are
safe
and
so
that
you
will
continue
to
be
safe
we'll
just
keep
all
of
these
records
and
these
memoranda
and
these
logs
but
its
better
that
you
don't
know
what
is
in
them.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
a
government
that
has
began
to
wince
at
a
full
disclosure
of
the
methods
that
it
uses
to
prosecute
and
imprisoned
its
citizens
is
government
that
has
begun
to
loose
its
feel
for
freedom.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
believe
mr.
justice
fortas
that
i
don't
want
to
make
suggestions
with
respect
to
how
any
member
of
the
executive
branch
of
government
who
was
charged
with
the
security
of
this
country
fulfills
his
duties.
but
i
do
say
this
to
you,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
mix
the
morals
of
the
cold
war
with
the
morality
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
i
think
if
there
comes
a
conflict
between
security
and
the
rights
of
the
individual
then
the
government
should
make
an
endow
shaped
typed
decision.
it
should
determine
whether
or
not
it
wants
to
make
the
necessary
revelation
to
protect
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
citizen
or
whether
it
wants
to
dismiss
this
case.
and
i
add
this
i
suggest
that
this
is
an
in
terrorem
argument,
it's
a
boogeyman
because
how
can
it
ever
compromise
the
security
of
the
united
states
to
return
to
someone
his
conversations
which
have
been
electronically
eavesdropped
on.
how
in
the
name
of
reason
can
that
be
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
how
can
that
be
violative
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
to
the
security?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
takes
up
a
very
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
it
would
take
a
far
more
prolific
imagination
than
i
have
to
conjure
up
a
situation
where
information
picked
up
on
an
electronic
eavesdropping
device
designed
to
catch
a
spy
would
give
him
information
which
he
did
not
have
access
to
in
the
first
instance
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i've
tried
since
you
began
to
post
the
question
and
i
failed.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
outset
i
would
like
to
make
an
analysis
if
i
may
of
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
this
motion.
i'm
afraid
a
fairly
hostile
analysis
because
i'm
concerned
that
the
sheer
proliferation
of
instances
of
microphone
surveillance
that
have
come
to
light
in
last
year
or
so
have
began
to
dull
our
capacity
for
indignation,
at
the
practice,
at
its
consequences
and
at
government's
position
with
respect
to
it.
from
the
papers
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
we
readily
conclude
that
petitioner
had
his
premises
under
electronic
surveillance
for
a
non-disclosed
indeterminate
amount
of
time.
that
a
device
was
placed
on
his
business
premises
for
the
purpose
of
picking
up
his
private
conversations
for
an
indeterminate
length
of
time.
and
we
further
can
conclude
that
in
fact
his
private
conversations
were
picked
up
over
an
indeterminate
period
of
time
and
they
were
recorded.
logs,
memoranda
and
records
were
made
of
those
conversations
which
are
now
in
the
possession
of
the
government.
we
can
further
conclude
that
of
course
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
have
been
violated
by
agents
of
the
government.
and
we
can
further
conclude
that
in
doing
these
acts,
agents
of
the
government
transgressed
the
criminal
statutes
of
the
united
states
because
title
18
of
section
241
makes
it
a
crime
to
injure
any
citizen
in
the
enjoyment
and
the
exercise
of
his
constitutional
rights,
it
makes
it
a
crime
punishable
by
a
term
of
imprisonment
up
to
10
years
and
a
fine
of
$5,000.
and
we
can
conclude
further,
because
this
court
can
judicially
notice
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
agents
of
the
government
in
cavalier
fashion
violated
the
statutes
of
illinois
because
there
is
a
very
stringent
eavesdropping
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
amenable
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
perpetrator,
to
eavesdrop
by
an
electronic
device
for
the
purpose
of
overhearing
the
private
conversations
of
a
citizen.
this
court,
beginning
14
years
ago,
put
the
spoken
word
within
the
penumbra
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
did
it
for
the
first
time
in
irvine
against
california
back
in
1954.
that's
repeatedly
said
so
in
silverman
in
1961,
in
wong
sun
in
1963
and
twice
last
year
in
burger
and
katz.
so
that
agents
of
the
government
have
taken
seized
illicitly
on
constitutionally
and
i
say
even
criminally
the
private
conversations
of
this
petitioner.
and
they
hold
records,
logs
and
memoranda
of
those
conversations
in
their
possession
now
but
they
say
that
petitioner
should
not
have
access
to
that
store
of
information.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
they
seized
conversations
of
other
persons,
persons
other
than
the
petitioner
at
a
time
when
he
was
not
present
on
his
own
premises,
i
suggest
sir,
that
they
violated
his
constitutional
rights
because
the
planting
of
an
electronic
device
by
necessity
requires
a
trespass.
it
requires
perhaps
a
burglary.
in
illinois,
it
would
require
a
burglary
because
it
would
be
an
illegal
entry
for
the
purpose
of
committing
a
crime
and
therefore
he
would
have
a
constitutional
standing
to
suppress
any
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
that
illegal
conduct.
in
order
intelligently
to
exercise
his
right
to
suppress,
he
must
know
and
therefore
i
say,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
right
to
privacy
of
the
third
and
fourth
party
must
yield
to
his
constitutional
right
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
have
a
constitutional
right
against
government
surveillance
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
which
has
been
abrogated
by
the
government
here.
they
do
not
have
a
right
superior
to
the
petitioner's
constitutional
right
to
prevent
him
from
learning
what
was
said
on
those
premises.
and
we
need
have
no
fear
mr.
justice
stewart,
concerning
that
because
in
the
first
instance
the
petitioners
themselves
will
ask
the
court
for
protective
orders
so
that
their
privacy
will
not
be
further
invaded
then
it
already
has
been
by
the
action
of
the
government.
and
protective
orders
can
be
issued
under
rule
16
for
the
benefit
of
those
third
parties
who
are
on
petitioners'
premises
who
conversed
between
themselves
and
who
would
like
to
have
their
privacy
protected
to
the
full
extent.
i
suggest
that
the
government's
position
on
this
matter
is
really
vacuous
because
it
is
asking
this
court
to
formulate
a
rule;
it
is
asking
this
court
to
formulate
a
policy
predicated
on
the
fact
that
the
trial
judges
are
unable
to
enforce
compliance
with
their
own
orders.
it's
asking
this
court
further
to
formulate
a
policy
predicated
on
the
fact
that
the
miscreant
eavesdropper
has
a
greater
interest
in
the
privacy
of
the
victim
than
their
victim
has.
i
suggest
that
all
the
safeguards
that
we're
concerned
about
that
the
solicitor's
--
general
has
expressed
himself
on
can
be
taken
cared
of
by
protective
orders
under
rule
16
for
those
persons.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
basic
application
of
principle
fundamental
toward
jurisprudence
equal
justice
under
the
law
would
require
--
and
we
don't
ask
for
this
and
it's
never
been
done.
it
would
require
even
a
prosecution
of
the
eavesdroppers
under
the
statutes
which
they
have
violated.
but
the
basic
rules
of
law,
logic,
reason
and
decency
certainly
require
them
to
make
restitution
to
the
victim,
to
put
the
victim
back
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
status
quo
if
they
had
gone
in
to
his
office
and
had
burglarized
his
correspondence
and
made
off
with
it,
could
the
government
be
heard
to
say
we
shall
return
only
such
of
his
correspondence
as
his
germane
to
the
pending
case
against
him?
could
they
say
that?
is
that
a
defensible
position
legally
or
morally?
i
suggest
that
is
not.
can
they
do
this?
can
they
go
in
and
listen
for
months
and
months
to
the
conversations
of
an
american
citizen?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
katz's
position
would
be
wholly
untenable
in
my
view
mr.
justice
fortas
because
he's
not
talking
about
his
own
premises
when
he
talks
about
the
use
of
a
public
telephone
by
someone
other
than
himself.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
am
saying
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'm
saying
that
the
petitioner's
office,
his
business
premises
were
invaded
unconstitutionally
and
illegally
and
he
has
the
rights
to
the
fruits
of
that
trespass
and
if
the
fruits
of
that
trespass
happens
to
be
the
conversations
of
two
persons
other
than
himself,
i
suggest
that
he
has
a
right
in
order
to
exercise
his
motion
to
suppress
intelligently
to
know
what
they
say
and
he
should
received
it.
i
would
be
the
first
to
say,
under
a
protective
order
that
would
safeguard
them
to
the
maximum
but
would
still
preserve
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
would
safeguard
the
persons
who
engaged
in
the
conversation.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
would
safeguard
them
from
disclosure
other
than
to
the
defendant
and
it
would
safeguard
them
from
disclosures
other
than
we're
absolutely
necessary
in
an
adversary
proceeding
designed
to
protect
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
defendant.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
and
as
i
indicated
earlier
the
petitioner
will
ask
for
such
an
order
because
the
petitioner
is
not
anxious
to
have
his
own
privacy
further
invaded.
and
so
he
will
ask
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
will
--
he
would
trust
his
counsel
but
he
might
not
trust
the
opposition
with
respect
to
the
conversations
that
are
disclosed
because
experience
has
taught
us
that
the
miscreant
eavesdropper
becomes
more
cavalier
with
respects
to
his
leaks
from
his
warehouse
of
stolen
privacy
after
it
has
been
released
to
the
victim.
so
that
there
is
a
reason
for
asking
for
such,
there
is
a
reason
for
asking
for
such
a
protective
order.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir,
a
neighborly
policeman,
if
the
court
please.
now,
with
respect
to
the
position
of
the
government
in
which
they
urged
the
court
that
this
really
is
not
anything
new,
this
is
really
an
old
traditional
way
of
handling
this
problem.
they
say
why
the
courts
have
been
handling
this
problem
in
jencks
materials
and
in
the
case
of
grand
jury
minutes
for
a
long
time
and
that's
all
we're
asking.
well,
i
think
there
are
two
very,
very
dramatic
differences
between
jencks
materials
on
the
one
hand
grand
jury
minutes
and
the
logs,
memoranda
and
records
of
electronically
eavesdropped
conversations.
the
first
is,
the
government
has
a
right
to
the
jencks
material
because
they
obtained
them
lawfully.
they
have
a
right
to
the
grand
jury
minutes
because
they
obtained
the
grand
jury
minutes
lawfully
and
when
a
defendant
comes
in
and
he
asked
for
a
jencks
materials
or
grand
jury
minutes,
he's
asking
for
something
that
belongs
to
the
government
to
which
he
has
no
right
unless
it
is
germane
to
his
guilt
or
innocence.
we're
not
talking
about
that,
we
are
talking
about
something
the
government
has
no
right.
they
have
no
right
to
his
private
conversations.
they
have
no
right
to
have
invaded
his
privacy
of
communication
and
he
is
asking
for
something
to
be
returned
that
belongs
to
him
and
that's
the
difference
between
jencks
act
materials,
grand
jury
materials
and
the
logs
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
depending
upon
how
long
he
has
a
lease
to
that
room,
i
would
say
that
he
has
a
right
and
a
standing
to
object
to
transgressions
on
the
privacy
of
that
(voice
overlap)
on
that
room.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
now,
mr.
y
you
say
has
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
does
not
rent
the
room?
mr.
y
is
a
pure
invitee
and
he
has
standing
there
only
during
the
life
of
his
invitation
then
i
would
say
that
his
rights
are
circumscribed
by
the
extent
of
his
invitation
and
when
he's
there
present,
he
would
have
the
right
to
his
conversations
and
those
conversations
of
the
persons
who
were
there
with
him
present
at
his
invitation
but
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
but
i
would
take
the
opposite
position
with
respect
to
the
man
who
has
the
lease
on
the
room
because
a
whole
different
set
of
principles
come
into
play.
he
is
complaining
about
a
trespass
against
premises
which
he
rented.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
now,
let's
settle
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
so
that
we
have
our
nomenclature
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
x
the
lessor
of
the
room?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
lessee?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
lessee?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
i
say
yes
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
x
is
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
and
there
has
been
a
trespass
by
the
agents
of
the
government
against
his
room,
there
has
been
the
planting
of
electronic
device
in
his
room
then
i
say
the
government
may
not
profit
against
him
in
its
prosecution
by
its
own
misconduct,
by
its
own
criminal
conduct,
by
its
own
burglary
that
in
order
for
him
to
suppress
that
which
is
been
gained
as
a
result
of
that
trespass
or
burglary,
its
necessary
for
him
to
know
under
a
protective
order
what
was
gleaned
thereby.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
saying
he
has
the
right
to
know,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
right.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir,
exactly
and
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
until
you
look
at
it.
and
i
say
this
with
respect
to
the
position
urged
by
the
solicitor
general,
in
which
he
would
advocate
the
judges
looking
at
this
material
in
determining
what
of
it
should
be
given
to
the
petitioner.
i'll
take
second
place
to
no
one
in
my
respect
for
the
courage,
the
independence,
the
objectivity
and
the
fairness
of
the
federal
trial
bench
in
this
country
but
without
as
a
preface,
i
say
respectfully
that
the
trial
judges
are
not
equipped
or
qualified
to
do
this
job.
they
can't
do
it.
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
determine
what
has
been
relevant
to
a
prosecution.
we
all
know
it's
been
said
a
hundred
times
i
suppose
that
a
criminal
prosecution
is
--
the
old
metaphors
it's
like
an
iceberg,
one
eight
of
it
shows
and
the
layers
know
the
seventh
eights
it's
under
water.
where
the
trial
judge
is
determining
whether
jencks
material
is
relevant,
he
has
just
heard
the
witness
testify
on
direct
examination.
now
he
juxtapose
as
a
sheaf
of
papers
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
what
he
reads
in
the
jencks
material
and
the
direct
testimony
and
he
can
do
that.
even
with
respect
to
grand
jury
testimony
he
may
with
diligence
take
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
read
it
carefully,
juxtapose
it
against
the
direct
testimony
of
the
witness
whom
he
has
just
heard
and
make
a
determination
that
there
is
something
useful
there
to
the
defense
but
we're
not
talking
about
that.
we're
not
talking
about
sheaves
of
material,
we
are
talking
in
--
as
our
paper
show,
we
are
talking
about
electronic
surveillances
which
have
produced
cases
of
material.
is
the
judge
to
be
handed
cases
of
logs
and
memoranda
and
as
he
was
in
one
case
and
had
to
delegate
part
of
the
responsibility
to
another
judge
and
take
four
and
half
weeks
to
read
it.
is
he
to
do
that
and
try
to
determine
what
is
relevant
to
the
skeleton
of
an
indictment
because
in
most
instances,
these
motions
will
be
before
trial?
let's
assume
it
was
an
income
tax
case.
the
standard
indictment
in
an
income
tax
case
today
is
the
words
of
the
statute,
a
number
and
a
year.
if
its
a
net
worth
case
and
if
there
has
been
an
electronic
surveillance
of
the
taxpayer
for
three
of
four
months,
and
if
the
trial
judge
is
handed
a
room
full
of
materials,
how
in
the
name
of
reason
is
he
going
to
determine
what
is
relevant
to
that
case.
only
the
counsel
and
his
client
can
make
that
determination.
why?
because
the
way
it's
done,
if
the
court
please,
supposing
the
taxpayer
had
a
telephone
conversation
with
his
lady
friend
to
use
the
same
illustration
as
was
used
earlier,
as
the
result
of
the
lead
from
that
conversation
the
lady
friend
will
be
interviewed
and
as
a
result
of
that,
ffurriers
and
jewelers
and
perhaps
automobile
salesman
will
be
unearthed.
they
will
show
up
as
witnesses
at
the
trial.
there
will
be
nothing
to
suggest
that
that
lead
came
from
what
might
have
been
an
innocuous
conversation
with
his
ex-lady
friend.
and
how
it
would
be
concealed,
it
will
be
concealed
in
the
most
interesting
clandestine
and
surreptitious
way
because
the
nomenclature
in
the
lexicon
of
the
eavesdroppers
is
confidential
informant.
as
the
result
of
a
disclosure
from
a
confidential
informant,
we
interviewed
c,
the
ex-lady
friend
of
the
suspect
and
we
found
out
the
following
so
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
judge
is
going
to
know
that
this
evidence
has
been
unearthed
as
a
result
of
an
electronic
eavesdropping
device.
and
in
fact
as
we
point
out
in
our
papers,
government
counsel
themselves
have
been
beguiled
by
this
tactic
and
have
stood
up
in
good
conscience
and
in
good
faith
and
made
misrepresentations
to
the
court
with
respect
to
the
source
of
their
evidence.
why,
because
the
eavesdropper
conceals
his
illegality
and
his
illicit
conduct
and
he
does
it
with
a
standard
investigative
nomenclature
confidential
informant
discloses.
furthermore,
we
have
shown
illustrations
where
the
monitor
in
charge
of
the
case
has
been
more
sophisticated
than
to
reduce
this
to
writing.
instead,
he
monitors
the
electronic
device.
he
listens
for
leads
and
then
that
evening
he
calls
in
the
field
and
he
tells
the
field
agents
go
check
this
out.
go
check
this
out.
check
this
out.
the
field
agent
is
kept
completely
in
the
dark.
he
never
knows
that
the
lead
was
born
from
a
tainted
source
and
that
the
evidence
which
he
is
unearthing
is
polluted
and
he
is
prepared
to
come
in
and
say,
well,
i
developed
this
lead
from
a
perfectly
lawful
source
and
i
did
it
as
a
result
of
an
instruction
from
my
superior.
when
the
superior
is
then
called
to
the
stand
to
find
out
where
he
got
his
lead,
he
has
the
cloak
of
confidential
informant
and
the
bug
is
not
unearth
and
i
suggest
that
only
counsel,
counsel
with
his
dedication
to
his
plan
will
lead
all
that
material
and
who
knows
the
facts
and
who
knows
the
case
from
beginning
to
end
can
do
the
job
of
determining
what
is
relevant
and
what
is
germane
and
what
leads
were
unearthed
with
respect
to
the
prosecution
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
comes
very
critical
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
sir,
i
wouldn't.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
would
readily
concede
mr.
justice
white
that
when
counsel
has
access
to
the
conversations
that
were
illegally
picked
up
as
a
result
of
this
microphone
surveillance
on
his
client,
he
is
going
to
find
irrelevant
materials
but
i
say
that
only
counsel
and
the
petitioner
can
make
that
determination
properly.
it
cannot
be
made
by
the
trial
judge.
there
is
no
way
that
the
trial
judge
can
make
that
kind
of
determination.
now,
i
suggest
that
this
problem
was
dealt
with
18
years
ago.
the
exact
problem
was
dealt
with
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
speaking
through
judge
learned
hand
in
the
united
states
against
kaplan.
it
is
in
--
on
all
force
with
this
case
except
that
it
had
the
additional
factor
of
having
national
security
overtones.
and
in
that
instance
where
there
was
wiretapping,
the
trial
judge
had
all
of
the
materials
turned
over
to
him
in
camera
and
he
of
coursed
released
much
of
that
material
to
the
defendant
and
her
counsel
but
he
made
an
in
camera
determination
that
a
large
portion
of
it
was
irrelevant
and
he
did
that
on
the
ground
that
the
national
security
was
involved
and
that
was
the
representation
that
was
made
to
him
by
counsel
for
the
government.
that
case
went
to
the
circuit
and
of
course
it
was
overturned,
it
was
reversed
and
the
court
found
that
there
was
error
there
of
constitutional
dimensions
and
the
court
reversed
the
case
and
sent
it
back
for
a
retrial
that
never
took
place.
now,
that
case
to
my
knowledge
and
i
say
this
without
serious
fear
of
contradiction
has
never
been
assailed
buy
the
untied
states
government
in
the
eighteen
years
of
its
life.
it's
been
cited
with
approbation
by
this
court.
i
have
heard
it
distinguished
many
times
but
i
have
never
heard
it
assails
such
as
it
has
been
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
this
case
because
the
government
now
takes
the
position
that
the
second
circuit
court
speaking
through
judge
learned
hand
decided
the
case
of
kaplan
against
the
united
states
erroneously.
i
say
if
the
court
please,
that
the
root
of
the
question
post
by
the
government's
motion
is
this,
is
it
alright
for
the
government
to
say
to
one
of
its
citizens
even
with
the
approbation
of
a
federal
district
judge,
we
have
had
a
faceless
informer
in
your
house
furlough
these
many
months
and
we
have
listened
to
you
conversations
and
we
have
recorded
those
conversations
and
we
have
them
in
logs,
in
memoranda
and
records
in
our
warehouse
of
stolen
privacy
but
be
of
good
cheer
because
we
have
examined
them
and
we
find
nothing
significant
to
this
pending
case
so
for
the
moment
you
are
safe
and
so
that
you
will
continue
to
be
safe
we'll
just
keep
all
of
these
records
and
these
memoranda
and
these
logs
but
its
better
that
you
don't
know
what
is
in
them.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
a
government
that
has
began
to
wince
at
a
full
disclosure
of
the
methods
that
it
uses
to
prosecute
and
imprisoned
its
citizens
is
government
that
has
begun
to
loose
its
feel
for
freedom.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
believe
mr.
justice
fortas
that
i
don't
want
to
make
suggestions
with
respect
to
how
any
member
of
the
executive
branch
of
government
who
was
charged
with
the
security
of
this
country
fulfills
his
duties.
but
i
do
say
this
to
you,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
mix
the
morals
of
the
cold
war
with
the
morality
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
i
think
if
there
comes
a
conflict
between
security
and
the
rights
of
the
individual
then
the
government
should
make
an
endow
shaped
typed
decision.
it
should
determine
whether
or
not
it
wants
to
make
the
necessary
revelation
to
protect
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
citizen
or
whether
it
wants
to
dismiss
this
case.
and
i
add
this
i
suggest
that
this
is
an
in
terrorem
argument,
it's
a
boogeyman
because
how
can
it
ever
compromise
the
security
of
the
united
states
to
return
to
someone
his
conversations
which
have
been
electronically
eavesdropped
on.
how
in
the
name
of
reason
can
that
be
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
how
can
that
be
violative
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
to
the
security?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
takes
up
a
very
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
it
would
take
a
far
more
prolific
imagination
than
i
have
to
conjure
up
a
situation
where
information
picked
up
on
an
electronic
eavesdropping
device
designed
to
catch
a
spy
would
give
him
information
which
he
did
not
have
access
to
in
the
first
instance
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i've
tried
since
you
began
to
post
the
question
and
i
failed.
