mr.
charles
danzig
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
defendant
butenko
is
a
co-defendant
in
the
prior
case
of
ivanov
argument
which
the
court
has
just
heard.
i
want
to
mention
at
the
outset
that
there
are
three
other
conspirators
who
were
charged
in
the
conspiracy
but
were
unindicted
by
reason
of
diplomatic
immunity.
and
their
presence
in
the
conspiracy
may
have
some
relationship
to
the
problem
of
standing
when
it
gets
up
into
the
argument.
now,
when
the
court
projected
the
issues
in
this
case,
the
issues
were
projected
on
the
assumption
that
there
had
been
in
the
chronic
surveillance
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
were
passed
that
point
now
because
the
government
has
frankly
admitted
that
it
has
overheard
conversations
of
ivanov
and
butenko.
it
has
said
nothing
to
date
about
any
conversations
that
overheard
of
the
other
three
conspirators
who
were
not
indicted.
and
of
course
when
it
heard
there
may
constitute
a
lead
to
the
two
defendants
who
were
tried
and
convicted.
the
main
position
of
the
government
is
rather
interesting.
it
takes
the
position
that
whatever
logs,
whatever
information
it
has
on
unlawful
surveillances
with
respect
to
these
two
defendants
should
be
turned
over
to
a
court
for
examination
in-camera.
it
says
also
quite
clearly
in
its
brief
that
if
that
were
dug,
it
is
competence
that
the
court
would
not
find
that
there
is
any
information
in
those
papers
and
records
that
are
turned
over
to
the
court
in
camera
that
could
in
anyway
have
led
to
the
conviction
to
evidence
that
was
used
in
the
conviction.
i
accept
that
statement
of
the
government
as
an
absolute
verdict
and
accepting
it
as
a
verdict,
let
us
see
just
where
we
go
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
government's
position.
the
government
comes
in
with
these
records,
gives
them
to
the
court
in
camera.
the
court
now
can
only
do
one
thing
and
we
are
really
in
a
post-conviction
situation
and
not
a
pretrial
situation
so
far
as
ivanov
and
butenko
are
considered.
there
is
a
massive
record
of
about
3500
pages.
there's
a
good
deal
of
documentary
evidence
and
i
suppose
the
court
being
its
diligent
federal
judge
will
sit
down
and
make
a
mechanical
comparison
of
what
the
record
it
has
received
in
camera
contains
and
what
the
transcript
shows.
assume
that
mechanical
comparison
is
made
and
assume
as
i
have
assumed,
the
absolute
truth
of
the
government's
statement
in
its
brief
that
an
examination
of
these
records
in
camera
will
convince
any
judge
that
they
are
no
way
arguably
relevant
to
the
conviction.
i
say,
that
if
we
buy
that
position
or
sanction
of
any
matter
whatsoever,
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
that's
the
end
of
mr.
alderisio
and
mr.
alderman
and
kolod
and
a
lot
of
other
people
who
similarly
circumstance
but
before
we
end
and
this
is
rather
interesting
because
if
that
happens,
we
have
no
problem
with
national
security
nor
do
we
have
any
problem
with
the
rights
of
third
persons
to
what
extent
they
maybe
injured
in
person
or
in
reputation,
they
just
fall
by
the
wayside
on
the
basis
of
these
assumptions.
the
court
will
never
reach
those
questions
and
this
is
exactly
the
position
the
government
has
taken
on
the
point
of
national
security
that
about
the
page
8
or
9
in
their
brief
here
in
butenko,
they
say,
"please,
do
not
put
this
to
the
option
of
making
the
choice
whether
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
or
whether
to
make
a
revelation
of
what
we
have
gathered.
please
let
us
bring
this
in,
in
camera
and
we
can
satisfy
any
judge
that
there
is
nothing
in
these
records
which
in
anyway
touch
the
prosecution
so
that
we
have
no
problem
with
national
security,
we
have
no
problem
with
injury
of
third
persons."
now
let's
see
whether
or
not
this
position
has
any
merit.
i
submit
it
has
not.
it's
violative
of
so
many
things.
it
had
been
said
time
and
time
again
by
this
court
with
respect
to
ex
parte
or
in
camera
proceedings.
take
the
jenks
case,
the
dennis
case
which
requires
a
turnover
of
material.
it
has
been
said
that
that
turnover
is
not
based
on
any
constitutional
requirements.
it's
said
that
its
based
on
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court
has
over
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
federal
court.
on
that
basis
and
that
basis
alone
it
would
seem
to
me
an
in
camera
proceeding
would
be
unjustified.
the
fifth
amendment
which
guarantees
to
every
party
and
this
united
states
due
process
of
law,
wouldn't
that
be
violated
by
the
government
going
in
with
the
massive
material
unattended
by
the
defense
either
through
counsel
or
through
the
defendant
himself.
and
then
when
we
look
at
the
protection
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
calls
for
the
assistance
of
counsel,
a
public
trial,
the
right
to
confront
the
witness
against
you,
none
of
those
requirements
which
are
embedded
in
our
constitution
unmistakably
or
observed
by
this
procedure
that
the
government
wants
this
court
to
improve.
now,
when
we
take
a
look
at
the
kind
of
records
we
have
that
they
want
to
submit
to
a
court,
that
too
should
give
i
suppose.
now,
i
haven't
seen
nor
has
anybody
seen
the
kind
of
records
they
have
in
this
case.
this
state
will
not
show
us
until
this
court
determines
how
if
and
all
or
they
are
to
be
shown.
but
we
do
have
some
information
on
that,
a
considerable
information
is
incorporated
in
mr.
williams'
brief,
in
alderman,
and
some
of
it
appears
in
his
brief
in
ivanov.
now,
what
do
we
find
there?
we
find
a
rather
shocking
situation.
we
find
a
serious
question
whether
all
the
records
have
been
produced
in
the
first
instance
and
every
time
they
produced
records,
they
come
along
and
some
of
later
time,
"oh,
we
didn't
know
about
these
facts
that
turned
up
in
some
draw
or
corner."
when
the
records
are
produced,
we
find
that
there's
information
in
there
that's
commingled
with
other
information,
so
as
to
conceal
the
source.
euphemisms
or
symbols
are
used
to
conceal
whether
or
not
the
source
of
the
information
came
from
a
live
investigation
or
from
an
electronic
bug
or
even
a
wiretap.
there
are
cases
where
there
are
no
records
at
all.
as
in
the
case
mr.
williams
adverted
to
where
the
agent
heard
the
telephone,
played
back
the
tapes,
got
--
heard
the
conversation,
played
back
the
tapes,
called
agents
all
over
the
country
and
started
a
chain
of
investigations
on
people
and
he
has
nothing.
now,
when
we
see
the
nature
of
the
records,
and
we
can
only
go
by
what
we
have
seen
in
the
past
and
what's
now
known
and
has
appeared
time
and
time
before
this
court.
when
we
see
what
kind
of
records
they
want
to
submit
to
a
court
in
camera,
we
say
that
we
though
not
having
our
constitutional
rights
protected.
we
are
advocating
a
course
of
conduct
that's
violative
of
those
rights
and
the
only
way
we
can
find
out
whether
there's
any
integrity
to
the
record
or
whether
or
not
there's
some
illegality
that's
been
concealed
is
by
having
a
full
pledge
adversary
hearing
at
which
extrinsic
evidence
must
be
produced
so
that
the
defendant
can
be
confronted
with
a
live
witness
and
not
a
record,
the
genuineness,
the
authenticity,
integrity
of
which
can
be
questioned
and
if
we
start
with
that,
no
court
of
justice
and
the
pursuit
of
justice
can
tolerate
a
course
such
as
now
being
seriously
advanced
by
a
government
that
is
governed
by
constitutional
limitations
as
this
government.
mr.
charles
danzig
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
should
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
charles
danzig
your
honor,
that
has
been
done
in
one
case
and
i
would
say
yes
or
and
at
least
to
see
how
much
of
the
evidence
that
has
been
on
our
assumption
that
are
legally
obtained
has
been
used
either
before
the
grand
jury
or
the
trial
because
if
we're
going
to
extra
paint
this
evil,
then
that
evil
it
is
and
the
extent
of
the
evil
has
been
mentioned
quite
empathically
and
fairly
by
decisions
of
this
court
in
katz
and
in
berger
and
others
that
--
other
decisions
that
don't
come
to
mind,
that
government
must
bear
the
burden
of
purging
itself
and
that
event
should
have
the
right
to
call
these
agents
as
though
they're
hostile
or
court
witnesses
and
cross-examiners
as
happened
in
way
where
we
had
a
jenks
statute
statement.
mr.
charles
danzig
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
national
security
problem
has
been
resolved
and
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
jenks
and
in
roviaro
where
this
bogeyman
has
been
raised
and
nobody
knows
whether
it
really
is
national
security
or
isn't
a
free
delivery
on
a
deposition
here.
i
don't
whether
or
not
their
facts
would
get
this
particular
case
into
the
product
of
that
definition.
now,
they
have
a
choice
--
mr.
charles
danzig
oh,
it's
a
very
seductive
situation
that's
very
easy
to
accept
that
as
national
security
but
the
content
of
the
crime
that
is
what
actually
did
happen
here
or
what
could
they
have
gotten
through
this.
i
don't
want
to
call
him
a
menial
because
he
had
a
very
high
sounding
title
like
an
administrative
director
or
something
like
that.
i'm
talking
about
the
defendant
butenko.
but
the
papers
he
had
access
to
and
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
trial,
i've
only
read
part
of
the
record
indicates
that
he
didn't
have
access
to
anything
of
any
great
importance
but
that's
not
too
important
here.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
they
have
i
think
merely
invoked
the
specter
of
national
security
to
gain
their
main
objective
and
that
is
to
have
an
in
camera
hearing.
now,
let's
see
just
what
some
of
the
things
--
mr.
charles
danzig
i
should
think
that
would
be
a
fair
position
to
put
the
government
into
sense
itself
has
created
a
predicament
it
finds
itself
in.
there
are
rather
means
available
to
it,
there
are
procedures
of
course
under
the
crime
control
and
that
becomes
a
very
simple
matter
you
applied
for
a
warrant
with
a
court
order.
but
prior
to
that,
there
have
been
occasions
when
some
governmental
authority
wanted
to
have
some
information
and
they
authorized
a
surveillance
and
electronic
surveillance
of
one
kind
or
another.
it
could've
been
done
within
constitutional
confines
but
this
government
has
acted
lawlessly
and
set
a
very
poor
example
for
the
rest
of
the
people
in
this
united
states.
now,
let's
go
to
the
actual
trial
procedure
that
was
used
here
for
us
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
in
camera
proceeding
could
in
anyway
produce
a
fair
result.
now,
the
case
was
tried
in
a
very
interesting
way
by
the
united
states
attorney.
he
put
on
agent
after
agent
and
did
not
have
them
testify
as
to
all
the
observations
they
made
over
a
period
of
six
months
while
these
people
where
under
surveillance.
he
put
them
on
for
let's
say
april
21st
and
after
he
testified
for
the
surveillance,
he
took
him
off
and
put
another
agent
on
the
pickup
the
termination
of
the
first
agent
surveillance
and
went
on
with
his
and
so
on
so
that
he
had
all
the
observations
of
the
total
day
surveillance
in
that
on
that
particular
day,
then
he
start
it
with
the
same
agents
and
maybe
other
agents
to
go
on
and
develop
their
surveillances
on
the
other
half
dozen
days
over
this
period
of
six
months
of
this
particular
thing
took
place.
now
--
and
that
was
a
good
way
of
doing
it
because
the
jury
did
not
get
confused,
it
could
keep
track
of
each
day
surveillance
and
see
just
what
these
people
did.
now,
on
a
sunday,
may
26,
an
agent
by
the
name
of
broderick
and
your
honors
will
find
this
at
page
595
of
the
trial
record.
he
was
surveiling
the
defendant
butenko
at
his
apartment
in
orange,
starting
at
9:30
in
the
morning.
mr.
butenko
went
to
the
store,
bought
a
sandy
paper,
went
back
stayed
there
all
day,
and
then
got
into
his
car
about
5:20
p.m.,
went
down
park
avenue
and
orange
until
he
hit
the
garden
state
parkway
and
the
agent
testified
that
he
discontinued
surveillance.
he
also
testified
he
reinstituted
surveillance
about
an
hour
later
and
picked
up
mr.
butenko's
car
all
by
20
miles
north
from
the
point
where
he
terminated
his
surveillance
in
front
of
a
restaurant
in
north
jersey.
now,
we're
talking
about
north
jersey,
a
heavily
traffic
area,
many
cars
out
on
a
sunday
and
the
jury
would
get
the
impression
that
mr.
butenko
had
eluded
his
tail,
the
man
who
was
watching
him.
oddly
enough,
mr.
broderick,
the
agent
had
no
trouble
picking
up
mr.
butenko
some
20
to
30
miles
away,
some
two
hours
later.
mr.
butenko
comes
into
sight
of
three
agents
who
are
now
in
a
construction
--
in
a
trailer
that's
used
on
a
construction
site
near
a
parking
lot.
and
that
agent
that
with
a
pair
of
binoculars
and
his
two
assistants
with
him
says,
testifies
that
he
saw
the
russians
in
their
car
come
in
at
6:15
and
mr.
butenko
in
his
little
falcon
come
in
a
few
minutes
later
and
they
all
went
around
and
then
nobody
got
out
of
the
car
for
they
all
followed
one
another
out
so
that
the
two
cars
met.
now,
i
think
the
fbi
is
pretty
good
but
i
don't
think
they're
that
good
that
they
could
follow
an
automobile
through
north
jersey,
have
a
surveillance
interrupted,
and
then
pick
it
up
some
20
to
30
miles
later.
the
clue
to
the
thing
is
that
these
three
agents
who
were
in
this
trailer
were
there
from
3
o'clock
on
that
sunday
afternoon,
the
same
day
may
26
and
they
were
expecting
mr.
butenko
and
they're
expecting
the
russians
there.
and
i
ask,
how
could
they
have
known
of
this
rendezvous
because
that's
what
it
was
but
through
a
bug
on
somebody
and
to
try
this
case
on
the
theory
that
all
these
evidence
was
obtained
through
physical
surveillance
and
not
through
a
bug
leaves
an
impression
on
a
jury's
mind
which
is
not
quite
consistent
with
a
fact
and
it
makes
me
question
whether
or
not
evidence
of
that
nature
is
reliable
and
whether
all
these
physical
surveillances
were
not
a
way
of
concealing
the
real
source
of
the
information
namely
the
bug
and
i
want
to
repeat
a
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
quote
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
palermo
whether
or
not
the
interpretation
placed
on
that
statute,
the
jenks
act
would
not
encourage
agents
to
prepare
their
reports
in
such
fashion
that
they
would
be
insulated
from
production.
and
i
question
here
whether
or
not
these
physical
surveillances
and
this
omission
of
information
about
the
real
source
of
the
clues
and
the
rendezvous
and
whatever
else
was
used
in
the
conviction
of
these
defendants,
i
question
whether
or
not
these
records
may
not
in
view
of
the
absolute
faith
the
government
has
in
submitting
the
records
in
camera
that
it
will
disclose
nothing
relevant.
i
question
as
mr.
justice
brennan
did
whether
or
not
these
records
contain
anything
about
any
electronic
information,
an
absent,
an
adversary
hearing
we
will
never
know
and
illegality
will
be
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception.
now,
one
of
the
issue
of
standing
your
honors
our
position
has
been
made
quite
clear
in
the
brief,
i
don't
think
i
have
a
time
to
really
--
mr.
charles
danzig
yes.
mr.
charles
danzig
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
go
all
the
way,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
go
there,
i'm
drawn
there
--
mr.
charles
danzig
as
a
result
of
what
this
court
has
said
about
the
deterrence
theory
of
the
exclusionary
rule
and
also
the
other
aspect
of
it
of
the
--
mr.
charles
danzig
there's
no
--
mr.
charles
danzig
there
can
be
no
--
mr.
charles
danzig
that's
absolutely
right.
i
go
all
the
way
and
i
add
to
that
and
strengthen
that
position
and
get
me
down
that
road
the
fact
that
if
this
court
has
not
adopt
that
rule
that's
really
putting
the
stamp
of
approval
on
the
use
of
evidence
that's
been
illegally
obtained
and
we're
talking
in
the
context
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
charles
danzig
oh,
i
think
that's
the
issue
your
honor,
what
is
the
mechanism,
what
procedure
we
would
use.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
agree
that
that
is
the
issue
but
i
say
that
the
procedure
that
the
government
suggest
is
one
that
violates
constitutional
guarantees
and
that
the
only
way
a
defendant's
rights
has
announced
time
and
time
again
by
this
court
in
a
narrative
situations
or
in
different
context
has
been
that
you
must
have
an
adversary
hearing.
i
say
if
we
buy
this
or
approved
this
position
of
an
in
camera
inspection,
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
don't
think
it
has
come
forth
with
that
but
the
standing
has
been
an
issue
projected
by
this
court
and
it's
limited
for
act
of
certiorari.
mr.
charles
danzig
and
then
for
that
reason
--
mr.
charles
danzig
wait,
your
honor,
there's
no
need
for
them
to
raise
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
if
they
get
the
in
camera
inspection,
we'll
have
nothing.
now,
we
don't
reach
the
question
of
standing
just
as
we
don't
reach
the
question
of
national
security
and
we
don't
reach
that
question
of
whether
the
disclosure
of
these
records
or
an
adversary
hearing
involving
cross-examination
of
agents
will
injure
third
persons.
we
don't
get
to
that.
it's
a
nice
way
of
closing
the
door
and
not
opening
pandora's
box.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
say
that
--
mr.
charles
danzig
i
don't
assume
that
at
all
but
what
i
do
assume
is
that
the
government
told
the
truth
in
this
case
when
it
said.
the
submission
of
these
records
to
a
trial
judge
will
convince
him
that
there's
nothing
arguably
relevant
to
the
prosecution.
i
start
with
that
and
the
judge
must,
and
i
say
--
mr.
charles
danzig
well
that
will
end
it.
that
will
end
it.
that's
exactly
what
they
want
to
do
but
i
say
it's
wrong
to
end
it
there.
there's
got
to
be
a
full
pledge
inquiry.
mr.
charles
danzig
if
the
defense
can
show
nothing
more
than
that
that
certainly
ought
to
end
the
matter.
i
don't
think
the
defense
has
the
right
to
it
when
it
said
let
me
look
at
all
your
files.
it
should
be
allowed
to
look
at
all
files
and
examine
all
agents
who
had
one
time
or
another
made
these
defendants
the
subject
matter
of
the
investigation.
the
target
of
the
electronic
surveillance
whether
it
was
these
defendants,
co-conspirators,
or
third
persons.
they
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
illegal
activity
of
the
government
directed
at
them
to
gather
evidence
on
them.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
think
that
is
so
your
honor.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
think
that
is
so.
well,
just
the
current
government
policy
is
will
tell
you
a
little
bit,
not
everything.
but
we
want
to
tell
it
to
the
judge
and
not
to
you.
mr.
charles
danzig
and
they
tell
us
nothing?
mr.
charles
danzig
i
think
--
mr.
charles
danzig
i
think
so
your
honor
because
if
we're
going
to
put
an
end
to
this
dirty
business
of
eavesdropping
and
invading
privacy
and
violating
fourth
amendment
rights,
there
should
be
some
remedy
available
to
a
defendant
to
raise
that
question.
now,
that
would
not
make
everybody
in
the
united
states
eligible
to
raise
the
question,
it's
only
those
who
are
accused
of
crime
or
gets
involved
with
government
--
with
the
government.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
danzig
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
defendant
butenko
is
a
co-defendant
in
the
prior
case
of
ivanov
argument
which
the
court
has
just
heard.
i
want
to
mention
at
the
outset
that
there
are
three
other
conspirators
who
were
charged
in
the
conspiracy
but
were
unindicted
by
reason
of
diplomatic
immunity.
and
their
presence
in
the
conspiracy
may
have
some
relationship
to
the
problem
of
standing
when
it
gets
up
into
the
argument.
now,
when
the
court
projected
the
issues
in
this
case,
the
issues
were
projected
on
the
assumption
that
there
had
been
in
the
chronic
surveillance
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
were
passed
that
point
now
because
the
government
has
frankly
admitted
that
it
has
overheard
conversations
of
ivanov
and
butenko.
it
has
said
nothing
to
date
about
any
conversations
that
overheard
of
the
other
three
conspirators
who
were
not
indicted.
and
of
course
when
it
heard
there
may
constitute
a
lead
to
the
two
defendants
who
were
tried
and
convicted.
the
main
position
of
the
government
is
rather
interesting.
it
takes
the
position
that
whatever
logs,
whatever
information
it
has
on
unlawful
surveillances
with
respect
to
these
two
defendants
should
be
turned
over
to
a
court
for
examination
in-camera.
it
says
also
quite
clearly
in
its
brief
that
if
that
were
dug,
it
is
competence
that
the
court
would
not
find
that
there
is
any
information
in
those
papers
and
records
that
are
turned
over
to
the
court
in
camera
that
could
in
anyway
have
led
to
the
conviction
to
evidence
that
was
used
in
the
conviction.
i
accept
that
statement
of
the
government
as
an
absolute
verdict
and
accepting
it
as
a
verdict,
let
us
see
just
where
we
go
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
government's
position.
the
government
comes
in
with
these
records,
gives
them
to
the
court
in
camera.
the
court
now
can
only
do
one
thing
and
we
are
really
in
a
post-conviction
situation
and
not
a
pretrial
situation
so
far
as
ivanov
and
butenko
are
considered.
there
is
a
massive
record
of
about
3500
pages.
there's
a
good
deal
of
documentary
evidence
and
i
suppose
the
court
being
its
diligent
federal
judge
will
sit
down
and
make
a
mechanical
comparison
of
what
the
record
it
has
received
in
camera
contains
and
what
the
transcript
shows.
assume
that
mechanical
comparison
is
made
and
assume
as
i
have
assumed,
the
absolute
truth
of
the
government's
statement
in
its
brief
that
an
examination
of
these
records
in
camera
will
convince
any
judge
that
they
are
no
way
arguably
relevant
to
the
conviction.
i
say,
that
if
we
buy
that
position
or
sanction
of
any
matter
whatsoever,
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
that's
the
end
of
mr.
alderisio
and
mr.
alderman
and
kolod
and
a
lot
of
other
people
who
similarly
circumstance
but
before
we
end
and
this
is
rather
interesting
because
if
that
happens,
we
have
no
problem
with
national
security
nor
do
we
have
any
problem
with
the
rights
of
third
persons
to
what
extent
they
maybe
injured
in
person
or
in
reputation,
they
just
fall
by
the
wayside
on
the
basis
of
these
assumptions.
the
court
will
never
reach
those
questions
and
this
is
exactly
the
position
the
government
has
taken
on
the
point
of
national
security
that
about
the
page
8
or
9
in
their
brief
here
in
butenko,
they
say,
"please,
do
not
put
this
to
the
option
of
making
the
choice
whether
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
or
whether
to
make
a
revelation
of
what
we
have
gathered.
please
let
us
bring
this
in,
in
camera
and
we
can
satisfy
any
judge
that
there
is
nothing
in
these
records
which
in
anyway
touch
the
prosecution
so
that
we
have
no
problem
with
national
security,
we
have
no
problem
with
injury
of
third
persons."
now
let's
see
whether
or
not
this
position
has
any
merit.
i
submit
it
has
not.
it's
violative
of
so
many
things.
it
had
been
said
time
and
time
again
by
this
court
with
respect
to
ex
parte
or
in
camera
proceedings.
take
the
jenks
case,
the
dennis
case
which
requires
a
turnover
of
material.
it
has
been
said
that
that
turnover
is
not
based
on
any
constitutional
requirements.
it's
said
that
its
based
on
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court
has
over
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
federal
court.
on
that
basis
and
that
basis
alone
it
would
seem
to
me
an
in
camera
proceeding
would
be
unjustified.
the
fifth
amendment
which
guarantees
to
every
party
and
this
united
states
due
process
of
law,
wouldn't
that
be
violated
by
the
government
going
in
with
the
massive
material
unattended
by
the
defense
either
through
counsel
or
through
the
defendant
himself.
and
then
when
we
look
at
the
protection
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
calls
for
the
assistance
of
counsel,
a
public
trial,
the
right
to
confront
the
witness
against
you,
none
of
those
requirements
which
are
embedded
in
our
constitution
unmistakably
or
observed
by
this
procedure
that
the
government
wants
this
court
to
improve.
now,
when
we
take
a
look
at
the
kind
of
records
we
have
that
they
want
to
submit
to
a
court,
that
too
should
give
i
suppose.
now,
i
haven't
seen
nor
has
anybody
seen
the
kind
of
records
they
have
in
this
case.
this
state
will
not
show
us
until
this
court
determines
how
if
and
all
or
they
are
to
be
shown.
but
we
do
have
some
information
on
that,
a
considerable
information
is
incorporated
in
mr.
williams'
brief,
in
alderman,
and
some
of
it
appears
in
his
brief
in
ivanov.
now,
what
do
we
find
there?
we
find
a
rather
shocking
situation.
we
find
a
serious
question
whether
all
the
records
have
been
produced
in
the
first
instance
and
every
time
they
produced
records,
they
come
along
and
some
of
later
time,
"oh,
we
didn't
know
about
these
facts
that
turned
up
in
some
draw
or
corner."
when
the
records
are
produced,
we
find
that
there's
information
in
there
that's
commingled
with
other
information,
so
as
to
conceal
the
source.
euphemisms
or
symbols
are
used
to
conceal
whether
or
not
the
source
of
the
information
came
from
a
live
investigation
or
from
an
electronic
bug
or
even
a
wiretap.
there
are
cases
where
there
are
no
records
at
all.
as
in
the
case
mr.
williams
adverted
to
where
the
agent
heard
the
telephone,
played
back
the
tapes,
got
--
heard
the
conversation,
played
back
the
tapes,
called
agents
all
over
the
country
and
started
a
chain
of
investigations
on
people
and
he
has
nothing.
now,
when
we
see
the
nature
of
the
records,
and
we
can
only
go
by
what
we
have
seen
in
the
past
and
what's
now
known
and
has
appeared
time
and
time
before
this
court.
when
we
see
what
kind
of
records
they
want
to
submit
to
a
court
in
camera,
we
say
that
we
though
not
having
our
constitutional
rights
protected.
we
are
advocating
a
course
of
conduct
that's
violative
of
those
rights
and
the
only
way
we
can
find
out
whether
there's
any
integrity
to
the
record
or
whether
or
not
there's
some
illegality
that's
been
concealed
is
by
having
a
full
pledge
adversary
hearing
at
which
extrinsic
evidence
must
be
produced
so
that
the
defendant
can
be
confronted
with
a
live
witness
and
not
a
record,
the
genuineness,
the
authenticity,
integrity
of
which
can
be
questioned
and
if
we
start
with
that,
no
court
of
justice
and
the
pursuit
of
justice
can
tolerate
a
course
such
as
now
being
seriously
advanced
by
a
government
that
is
governed
by
constitutional
limitations
as
this
government.
mr.
charles
danzig
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
should
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
charles
danzig
your
honor,
that
has
been
done
in
one
case
and
i
would
say
yes
or
and
at
least
to
see
how
much
of
the
evidence
that
has
been
on
our
assumption
that
are
legally
obtained
has
been
used
either
before
the
grand
jury
or
the
trial
because
if
we're
going
to
extra
paint
this
evil,
then
that
evil
it
is
and
the
extent
of
the
evil
has
been
mentioned
quite
empathically
and
fairly
by
decisions
of
this
court
in
katz
and
in
berger
and
others
that
--
other
decisions
that
don't
come
to
mind,
that
government
must
bear
the
burden
of
purging
itself
and
that
event
should
have
the
right
to
call
these
agents
as
though
they're
hostile
or
court
witnesses
and
cross-examiners
as
happened
in
way
where
we
had
a
jenks
statute
statement.
mr.
charles
danzig
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
national
security
problem
has
been
resolved
and
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
jenks
and
in
roviaro
where
this
bogeyman
has
been
raised
and
nobody
knows
whether
it
really
is
national
security
or
isn't
a
free
delivery
on
a
deposition
here.
i
don't
whether
or
not
their
facts
would
get
this
particular
case
into
the
product
of
that
definition.
now,
they
have
a
choice
--
mr.
charles
danzig
oh,
it's
a
very
seductive
situation
that's
very
easy
to
accept
that
as
national
security
but
the
content
of
the
crime
that
is
what
actually
did
happen
here
or
what
could
they
have
gotten
through
this.
i
don't
want
to
call
him
a
menial
because
he
had
a
very
high
sounding
title
like
an
administrative
director
or
something
like
that.
i'm
talking
about
the
defendant
butenko.
but
the
papers
he
had
access
to
and
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
trial,
i've
only
read
part
of
the
record
indicates
that
he
didn't
have
access
to
anything
of
any
great
importance
but
that's
not
too
important
here.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
they
have
i
think
merely
invoked
the
specter
of
national
security
to
gain
their
main
objective
and
that
is
to
have
an
in
camera
hearing.
now,
let's
see
just
what
some
of
the
things
--
mr.
charles
danzig
i
should
think
that
would
be
a
fair
position
to
put
the
government
into
sense
itself
has
created
a
predicament
it
finds
itself
in.
there
are
rather
means
available
to
it,
there
are
procedures
of
course
under
the
crime
control
and
that
becomes
a
very
simple
matter
you
applied
for
a
warrant
with
a
court
order.
but
prior
to
that,
there
have
been
occasions
when
some
governmental
authority
wanted
to
have
some
information
and
they
authorized
a
surveillance
and
electronic
surveillance
of
one
kind
or
another.
it
could've
been
done
within
constitutional
confines
but
this
government
has
acted
lawlessly
and
set
a
very
poor
example
for
the
rest
of
the
people
in
this
united
states.
now,
let's
go
to
the
actual
trial
procedure
that
was
used
here
for
us
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
in
camera
proceeding
could
in
anyway
produce
a
fair
result.
now,
the
case
was
tried
in
a
very
interesting
way
by
the
united
states
attorney.
he
put
on
agent
after
agent
and
did
not
have
them
testify
as
to
all
the
observations
they
made
over
a
period
of
six
months
while
these
people
where
under
surveillance.
he
put
them
on
for
let's
say
april
21st
and
after
he
testified
for
the
surveillance,
he
took
him
off
and
put
another
agent
on
the
pickup
the
termination
of
the
first
agent
surveillance
and
went
on
with
his
and
so
on
so
that
he
had
all
the
observations
of
the
total
day
surveillance
in
that
on
that
particular
day,
then
he
start
it
with
the
same
agents
and
maybe
other
agents
to
go
on
and
develop
their
surveillances
on
the
other
half
dozen
days
over
this
period
of
six
months
of
this
particular
thing
took
place.
now
--
and
that
was
a
good
way
of
doing
it
because
the
jury
did
not
get
confused,
it
could
keep
track
of
each
day
surveillance
and
see
just
what
these
people
did.
now,
on
a
sunday,
may
26,
an
agent
by
the
name
of
broderick
and
your
honors
will
find
this
at
page
595
of
the
trial
record.
he
was
surveiling
the
defendant
butenko
at
his
apartment
in
orange,
starting
at
9:30
in
the
morning.
mr.
butenko
went
to
the
store,
bought
a
sandy
paper,
went
back
stayed
there
all
day,
and
then
got
into
his
car
about
5:20
p.m.,
went
down
park
avenue
and
orange
until
he
hit
the
garden
state
parkway
and
the
agent
testified
that
he
discontinued
surveillance.
he
also
testified
he
reinstituted
surveillance
about
an
hour
later
and
picked
up
mr.
butenko's
car
all
by
20
miles
north
from
the
point
where
he
terminated
his
surveillance
in
front
of
a
restaurant
in
north
jersey.
now,
we're
talking
about
north
jersey,
a
heavily
traffic
area,
many
cars
out
on
a
sunday
and
the
jury
would
get
the
impression
that
mr.
butenko
had
eluded
his
tail,
the
man
who
was
watching
him.
oddly
enough,
mr.
broderick,
the
agent
had
no
trouble
picking
up
mr.
butenko
some
20
to
30
miles
away,
some
two
hours
later.
mr.
butenko
comes
into
sight
of
three
agents
who
are
now
in
a
construction
--
in
a
trailer
that's
used
on
a
construction
site
near
a
parking
lot.
and
that
agent
that
with
a
pair
of
binoculars
and
his
two
assistants
with
him
says,
testifies
that
he
saw
the
russians
in
their
car
come
in
at
6:15
and
mr.
butenko
in
his
little
falcon
come
in
a
few
minutes
later
and
they
all
went
around
and
then
nobody
got
out
of
the
car
for
they
all
followed
one
another
out
so
that
the
two
cars
met.
now,
i
think
the
fbi
is
pretty
good
but
i
don't
think
they're
that
good
that
they
could
follow
an
automobile
through
north
jersey,
have
a
surveillance
interrupted,
and
then
pick
it
up
some
20
to
30
miles
later.
the
clue
to
the
thing
is
that
these
three
agents
who
were
in
this
trailer
were
there
from
3
o'clock
on
that
sunday
afternoon,
the
same
day
may
26
and
they
were
expecting
mr.
butenko
and
they're
expecting
the
russians
there.
and
i
ask,
how
could
they
have
known
of
this
rendezvous
because
that's
what
it
was
but
through
a
bug
on
somebody
and
to
try
this
case
on
the
theory
that
all
these
evidence
was
obtained
through
physical
surveillance
and
not
through
a
bug
leaves
an
impression
on
a
jury's
mind
which
is
not
quite
consistent
with
a
fact
and
it
makes
me
question
whether
or
not
evidence
of
that
nature
is
reliable
and
whether
all
these
physical
surveillances
were
not
a
way
of
concealing
the
real
source
of
the
information
namely
the
bug
and
i
want
to
repeat
a
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
quote
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
palermo
whether
or
not
the
interpretation
placed
on
that
statute,
the
jenks
act
would
not
encourage
agents
to
prepare
their
reports
in
such
fashion
that
they
would
be
insulated
from
production.
and
i
question
here
whether
or
not
these
physical
surveillances
and
this
omission
of
information
about
the
real
source
of
the
clues
and
the
rendezvous
and
whatever
else
was
used
in
the
conviction
of
these
defendants,
i
question
whether
or
not
these
records
may
not
in
view
of
the
absolute
faith
the
government
has
in
submitting
the
records
in
camera
that
it
will
disclose
nothing
relevant.
i
question
as
mr.
justice
brennan
did
whether
or
not
these
records
contain
anything
about
any
electronic
information,
an
absent,
an
adversary
hearing
we
will
never
know
and
illegality
will
be
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception.
now,
one
of
the
issue
of
standing
your
honors
our
position
has
been
made
quite
clear
in
the
brief,
i
don't
think
i
have
a
time
to
really
--
mr.
charles
danzig
yes.
mr.
charles
danzig
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
go
all
the
way,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
go
there,
i'm
drawn
there
--
mr.
charles
danzig
as
a
result
of
what
this
court
has
said
about
the
deterrence
theory
of
the
exclusionary
rule
and
also
the
other
aspect
of
it
of
the
--
mr.
charles
danzig
there's
no
--
mr.
charles
danzig
there
can
be
no
--
mr.
charles
danzig
that's
absolutely
right.
i
go
all
the
way
and
i
add
to
that
and
strengthen
that
position
and
get
me
down
that
road
the
fact
that
if
this
court
has
not
adopt
that
rule
that's
really
putting
the
stamp
of
approval
on
the
use
of
evidence
that's
been
illegally
obtained
and
we're
talking
in
the
context
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
charles
danzig
oh,
i
think
that's
the
issue
your
honor,
what
is
the
mechanism,
what
procedure
we
would
use.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
agree
that
that
is
the
issue
but
i
say
that
the
procedure
that
the
government
suggest
is
one
that
violates
constitutional
guarantees
and
that
the
only
way
a
defendant's
rights
has
announced
time
and
time
again
by
this
court
in
a
narrative
situations
or
in
different
context
has
been
that
you
must
have
an
adversary
hearing.
i
say
if
we
buy
this
or
approved
this
position
of
an
in
camera
inspection,
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
don't
think
it
has
come
forth
with
that
but
the
standing
has
been
an
issue
projected
by
this
court
and
it's
limited
for
act
of
certiorari.
mr.
charles
danzig
and
then
for
that
reason
--
mr.
charles
danzig
wait,
your
honor,
there's
no
need
for
them
to
raise
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
if
they
get
the
in
camera
inspection,
we'll
have
nothing.
now,
we
don't
reach
the
question
of
standing
just
as
we
don't
reach
the
question
of
national
security
and
we
don't
reach
that
question
of
whether
the
disclosure
of
these
records
or
an
adversary
hearing
involving
cross-examination
of
agents
will
injure
third
persons.
we
don't
get
to
that.
it's
a
nice
way
of
closing
the
door
and
not
opening
pandora's
box.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
say
that
--
mr.
charles
danzig
i
don't
assume
that
at
all
but
what
i
do
assume
is
that
the
government
told
the
truth
in
this
case
when
it
said.
the
submission
of
these
records
to
a
trial
judge
will
convince
him
that
there's
nothing
arguably
relevant
to
the
prosecution.
i
start
with
that
and
the
judge
must,
and
i
say
--
mr.
charles
danzig
well
that
will
end
it.
that
will
end
it.
that's
exactly
what
they
want
to
do
but
i
say
it's
wrong
to
end
it
there.
there's
got
to
be
a
full
pledge
inquiry.
mr.
charles
danzig
if
the
defense
can
show
nothing
more
than
that
that
certainly
ought
to
end
the
matter.
i
don't
think
the
defense
has
the
right
to
it
when
it
said
let
me
look
at
all
your
files.
it
should
be
allowed
to
look
at
all
files
and
examine
all
agents
who
had
one
time
or
another
made
these
defendants
the
subject
matter
of
the
investigation.
the
target
of
the
electronic
surveillance
whether
it
was
these
defendants,
co-conspirators,
or
third
persons.
they
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
illegal
activity
of
the
government
directed
at
them
to
gather
evidence
on
them.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
think
that
is
so
your
honor.
mr.
charles
danzig
i
think
that
is
so.
well,
just
the
current
government
policy
is
will
tell
you
a
little
bit,
not
everything.
but
we
want
to
tell
it
to
the
judge
and
not
to
you.
mr.
charles
danzig
and
they
tell
us
nothing?
mr.
charles
danzig
i
think
--
mr.
charles
danzig
i
think
so
your
honor
because
if
we're
going
to
put
an
end
to
this
dirty
business
of
eavesdropping
and
invading
privacy
and
violating
fourth
amendment
rights,
there
should
be
some
remedy
available
to
a
defendant
to
raise
that
question.
now,
that
would
not
make
everybody
in
the
united
states
eligible
to
raise
the
question,
it's
only
those
who
are
accused
of
crime
or
gets
involved
with
government
--
with
the
government.
thank
you.
