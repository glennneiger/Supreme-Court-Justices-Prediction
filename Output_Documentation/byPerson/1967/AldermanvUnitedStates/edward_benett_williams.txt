mr.
edward
benett
williams
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner,
igor
ivanov,
a
citizen
of
the
soviet
union
and
employee
of
amtorg,
a
soviet
trading
company
stands
convicted
of
a
conspiracy
to
commit
espionage
against
the
united
states
under
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
section
794.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
the
third
circuit,
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
here
and
without
detailing
the
intermediate
pleadings,
between
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
oral
argument,
it's
surprising
to
say
that
pursuant
to
the
order
in
the
kolod
case,
the
government
conceded
that
certiorari
should
be
granted
that
there
should
be
a
remand
that
the
district
court
for
an
in
camera
ex
parte
hearing
with
respect
to
electronic
surveillances
conducted
in
that
case.
now,
in
the
brief
filed
in
this
court
in
ivanov,
the
government
says
that
conversations
of
each
of
the
petitioners
in
these
cases
were
overheard
by
the
use
of
the
electronic
surveillance
equipment
and
footnoted
is
this
statement.
in
some
of
the
instances,
the
installation
had
been
specifically
approved
by
the
then
attorney
general.
in
others,
the
equipment
was
installed
under
a
broader
grant
of
authority
to
the
fbi
and
affected
the
time
which
did
not
require
specific
authorization.
experience
would
indicate
to
us,
i
submit
that
that
is
a
concession
of
both
wiretapping
and
eavesdropping
in
this
case.
now,
this
case
is
significantly
different
from
the
case
just
argued
at
bar
because
the
government
seriously
averse
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
national
security
consideration
to
be
waived
in
the
balance
of
competing
social
interest.
i
think
it's
equally
significant,
if
the
court
please
if
i
may
say
so
at
the
outset
of
this
argument
that
the
government
by
that
reason
does
not
ask
for
different
treatment
between
alderman
and
ivanov.
it
asks
for
precisely
the
same
treatment,
it
asks
for
in
camera
ex
parte
proceedings
with
respect
to
the
logs
electronic
--
the
logs
memorandum
records
of
the
electronic
surveillance
in
each.
now,
first
of
all,
it
is
our
position
as
the
court
please
that
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
does
not
make
a
division
among
the
various
kinds
of
crime.
it
does
not
draw
a
line
of
demarcation
and
the
founding
fathers
when
the
constitution
was
written
and
when
the
american
bill
of
rights
were
forged
understood
quite
clearly
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
various
types
of
crime.
they
gave
recognition
to
this
in
article
3,
section
3
of
the
constitution
when
they
defined
treason
and
they
prescribed
the
quantum
and
quality
of
proof
necessary
for
a
treason
conviction.
but
they
didn't
make
any
exception
in
the
fourth
amendment
with
respect
to
spy
catchers
or
subversive
hunters.
now,
it's
next
to
our
position,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
certifies
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
national
security
consideration
which
should
excuse
the
united
states
from
making
a
disclosure
with
respect
to
the
nature,
the
time,
the
place,
or
the
fruits
of
an
electronic
surveillance
illegally
conducted,
we
say
he
should
be
excused,
provided
he
consents
to
a
dismissal
of
the
prosecution
under
the
time-honored
principle
of
kaplan
against
the
united
states
which
was
decided
in
1950,
an
opinion
by
judge
learned
hand
which
was
forced
where
with
the
facts
in
the
case
at
bar.
there
was
electronic
surveillance,
there
was
an
espionage
case,
there
was
an
alleged
spy,
a
convicted
spy
and
the
premise
was
articulated
there
that
the
government
had
a
choice
of
making
a
full
disclosure
to
the
defendant
for
the
vindication
of
our
constitutional
rights
or
dismissing,
the
government
dismissed.
now,
that
case
and
i
think
it's
significant
to
note
has
stood
on
a
sale
by
the
government
for
18
years
until
argument
was
heard
in
this
case
last
term
and
that
case
was
simply
a
repetition
of
the
doctrine
articulated
also
by
the
second
circuit
in
united
states
against
anderson.
so
it's
our
position,
if
the
court
please,
reduced
to
its
essence
that
the
concept
national
security
should
not
be
the
talisman
for
a
pro
tanto
suspension
of
due
process
of
law
or
of
any
of
the
rights
guaranteed
to
an
accused
in
a
criminal
case.
if,
in
the
conduct
of
relationships
between
governments
in
our
time,
it
has
become
the
custom
or
it
has
become
a
necessity
to
engage
in
wiretapping
or
eavesdropping
or
dissembling
or
purloining
or
burglarizing
or
even
killing,
it
is
not
our
argument
in
this
court
today
that
the
executive
branch
should
be
manacled
or
impeded
or
harassed
in
the
conduct
of
relationships
with
other
governments.
it
is
our
argument
here
today
that
at
least
the
federal
courts
should
be
a
sanctuary
in
the
jungle,
and
that
these
morals
and
that
these
mores
should
not
be
imported
into
the
american
judiciary
system
and
that
the
fruits
of
this
kind
of
conduct
should
not
become
evidence
in
a
criminal
case
brought
by
the
sovereign
power
against
an
accused,
nor
should
leads
derived
from
this
kind
of
conduct
be
available
to
the
prosecutor
in
a
criminal
case
brought
by
the
sovereign
power.
in
essence,
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
in
this
case,
it's
asserting
its
right
to
be
let
alone
and
to
that
we
say
?amen?,
so
long
as
the
evidence
is
not
offered
in
a
federal
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
think
that
is
the
government's
position
your
honor,
the
government's
position
is
the
same
in
this
case
as
it
is
in
the
alderman
case
and
we
say
that
just
as
it
is
impossible
for
this
kind
of
determination
to
be
made
in
the
alderman
case
it's
equally
impossible
for
this
kind
of
determination
to
be
made
in
camera
ex
parte
why
the
judge
and
even
though
the
issue
may
affect
national
security
but
the
government
has
argued
in
its
brief
at
great
lengths
that
we
are
seeking
to
impede
the
government
in
assuring
the
national
security
and
i
say
that
we
are
not.
i
say
that
we
are
not
asking
that
any
rules
be
fashioned
to
impede
or
harass
the
government
in
the
conduct
of
its
affairs
with
other
governments
or
in
the
conduct
of
its
duty
to
preserve
the
national
security.
we
are
asking
for
a
much
narrower
rule.
we
are
asking
that
this
kind
of
evidence
not
be
offered
in
court
and
we
are
saying
that
the
same
rules
should
pertain
to
this
kind
of
evidence
as
obtains
with
respect
to
any
other
kind
of
evidence
that
there
should
be
a
disclosure.
the
disclosure
maybe
made
under
rule
16
as
the
disclosure
maybe
made
and
any
other
kind
of
case
to
eliminate
a
necessary
dissemination
of
the
information
so
that
our
position
if
the
court
please
is
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
disclosure
under
appropriate
protective
orders
and
he
has
the
right
to
disclosure
to
his
counsel
under
appropriate
protective
orders
regardless
of
what
the
nature
of
the
information
may
be,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
is
contended
by
the
government
that
it
affects
national
security
unless
the
government
is
willing
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
in
which
case
we
agree
that
it
should
be
dealt.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
don't
read
them
as
making
that
distinction
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
read
them
as
asking
for
the
same
kind
of
proceeding
in
each
case.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
and
i
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
don't
read
this
as
contending
that.
they
may
contend
it
orally
your
honor.
i
read
them
as
asking
for
the
same
kind
of
hearing
and
i
also
contend
if
court
--
the
court
please
that
protective
orders
can
be
fashioned
here
just
as
in
the
alderman
case
and
if
we
are
driven
to
the
unhappy
conclusion
that
the
alleged
spy
goes
free,
then
i
think
we
can
draw
some
consolation
from
the
history
of
the
last
three
decades
that
in
three
decades
of
recorded
federal
jurisprudence
during
which
there
were
three
wardens,
we
have
only
one
instance
of
an
averred
spy
going
free
in
this
frame
of
reference
and
she
was
the
defendant
in
the
case
to
which
i
alluded
to
kaplan
case,
and
i
think
we
could
also
get
a
measure
of
consolation
from
the
fact
that
of
all
the
crimes
in
federal
jurisprudence,
the
lowest
amount
of
recidivism
takes
place
in
the
area
of
espionage
because
once
a
spy
is
exposed,
he
is
by
and
large
diffused.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes.
there
are
two
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
three
others
who
were
soviet
nationals
who
had
diplomatic
status
enough
to
go
back
to
the
soviet
union
with
our
blessing.
now
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
problems
that
this
court
has
propounded
on
standing
in
this
case
and
the
court
has
propounded
some
hard
questions
with
respect
to
the
subject
of
standing
in
this
case.
now
for
purposes
of
standing,
we
do
contend
in
capsulize
form
that
a
person
agreed
within
the
purview
of
rule
41
is
one
against
whom
the
search
--
the
illicit
search
is
directed
whether
he's
known
or
unknown
at
the
time.
we
say
if
the
court
please
that
for
purposes
of
standing,
the
concept
must
be
considered
under
rule
describing
an
aggrieved
person.
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
it
must
considered
against
the
fact
ground
of
an
age
in
which
electronic
surveillance
has
become
a
widespread
investigative
technique
and
we
must
consider
it
in
the
light
of
the
philosophical
rational
for
the
federal
exclusionary
rule.
now,
rational
in
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
has
been
articulated
many
times
by
many
courts
as
being
simply
that
the
courts
recoil
at
the
philosophic
concept
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
designed
as
a
deterrent
to
lawless
law
enforcement.
it's
designed
to
discourage
it
and
to
effect
compliance
with
the
agents
of
the
sovereign
power
with
the
law.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
rule
on
standing
for
which
the
government
contends
is
--
are
kept
and
that
it
is
ineffective
against
this
black
ground
during
the
early
evolution
of
cases
under
the
fourth
amendment
by
and
large,
we
were
concerned
with
cases
where
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights
had
been
invaded
by
virtue
of
the
search
of
his
premises
and
the
seizure
of
his
papers
and
his
effects
so
that
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
there
was
not
a
serious
problem
of
standing
but
we
have
passed
that
here
on
and
we
now
have
an
era
where
electronic
surveillance
is
used
in
the
following
manner
as
is
illustrated
by
many
instances
in
our
papers.
the
government
through
its
agents
does
not
listen
to
the
suspect,
it
does
not
invade
his
premises
electronically
by
planting
an
electronic
bug
there
rather
in
a
very
careful
selective
manner,
it
listens
to
the
conversations
of
his
relatives
and
friends
and
associates,
and
it
invades
the
premises
of
his
relatives
and
friends
and
associates,
and
it
gathers
criminal
intelligence
by
this
fact
which
it
indexes
and
computerizes
and
makes
dossiers
until
such
time
as
it
has
by
utilizing
these
leads
developed
a
situation
wherein
an
indictment
can
be
secured
by
the
presentation
of
some
of
these
evidence
to
a
grand
jury
and
subsequently
a
conviction
can
be
obtained
by
the
use
of
the
same
evidence
and
that
the
suspect
defendant
is
left
without
a
remedy
because
the
government
contends
he
was
not
victimized
because
he
was
not
heard
and
because
no
premises
in
which
he
had
a
proprietary
interest
where
invaded.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
government's
position
on
standing
in
this
case
with
respect
to
electronic
surveillance
is
like
solomon's
approach
to
the
baby,
cut
it
in
half!
says
the
government,
there
are
two
competing
social
interests.
one,
that
the
culprit
should
not
go
free,
society
has
a
major
interest
in
this.
the
other,
is
that
there
should
be
a
deterrence
in
illegal
methods
of
law
enforcement,
the
government's
proposal
would
satisfy
neither
competing
social
interest,
why,
because
it
says
that
a
selected
class
of
culprits
should
go
free,
those
who
fall
within
their
concept
of
the
term
standing
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
green
light
should
be
flashed
for
a
continuation
of
illicit
electronic
surveillance
because
this
kind
of
activity
can
remain
tremendously
fruitful
and
beneficial
in
the
gathering
of
criminal
intelligence
without
giving
the
ultimate
victim
a
status
to
object.
now
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
time
has
come
for
standing
to
be
given
vis-à-vis
electronic
surveillances
to
the
following:
one,
to
those
whose
conversations
are
illicitly
listened
to
and
the
government
does
not
gainsay
this.
two,
to
those
persons
whose
premises
are
illegally
invaded
by
electronic
eavesdropping
equipment
and
as
i
read
the
government's
brief
at
page
21
in
the
alderman
case,
it
clearly
does
not
gainsay
this,
of
course.
as
i
previously
read
to
the
court,
the
government
says
it
adheres
to
the
position
that
a
defendant
though
not
a
participant,
if
the
overhearing
occurred
on
premises
owned
by
him
or
in
which
he
had
some
interests,
he
has
a
standing.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
one
who
is
the
subject
matter
of
an
overhearing
illegal
in
nature
must
have
standing
if
illicit
electronic
surveillance
is
to
be
deterred
by
federal
agents
and
finally,
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes,
sir.
finally,
i
say
this,
and
this
sounds
terribly
much
like
a
simplistic
approach
to
the
problem
and
assure
the
court
that
it
is
not
a
simplistic
approach
to
the
problem.
i
assure
you
that
consideration
has
been
given
to
all
of
the
competing
social
and
legal
interest
in
making
the
state.
i
believe
that
standing
must
be
given
to
a
codefendant
in
a
criminal
case
whether
he'd
be
named
as
a
coconspirator
or
not
and
i
say
this
first
of
all,
because
it
is
hard
to
conceive
that
defendants
can
be
joined
in
a
criminal
case
in
the
federal
courts
under
rule
8
which
provides
for
joinder
of
defendants,
unless
there
be
what
could
have
been
averred
to
be
a
conspiracy.
why?
because
the
rule
provides
that
they
must
have
been
engaged
in
an
act
or
series
of
acts
or
transaction
or
series
of
transactions
constituting
an
offense.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
suggest
--
suppose
he's
as
a
defendant
being
separately
prosecuted
in
connection
with
the
same
transactions
as
not
a
codefendant?
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
that's
why
your
honor
we
are
driven
--
we
are
driven
in
order
to
avoid
this
kind
of
circumvention,
we
are
driven
to
say
that
the
overall
position
is
whether
or
the
defendant
is
that
he
has
standing
if
the
search
was
a
search
directed
against
him.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
don't
to
want
to
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
don't
want,
if
the
court
please
or
anyone
to
be
able
to
do
by
indirection
that
which
is
inhibited
directly
and
if
the
prosecutor
by
the
simple
device
of
not
joining
two
persons
in
the
same
prosecution
but
it's
averred
their
proper
concept
of
standing,
then
i
would
be
oppose
to
that
and
that's
why
i
suggest
your
honor
as
an
umbrella
on
which,
under
which
to
gather
all
of
the
kinds
of
electronic
surveillance,
the
fruits
of
which
should
be
excluded.
the
rule
that
a
person
agreed
within
rule
41
is
a
person
against
whom
the
electronic
surveillance
was
directed
and
we
all
know
that
when
an
electronic
surveillance
is
directed
against
the
first,
it
is
not
only
against
him
but
it
is
against
those
engaged
in
the
illicit
enterprise
with
him
whether
identified
or
unidentified
at
the
time
when
there
is
a
monitoring,
the
government
is
not
just
interested
in
what
it
hears
about
it
wants
to
know
about
his
business
associates
and
friends
and
acquaintances.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i've
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
in
this
case,
i
don't
have
to
go
to
that
far,
i
believe
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
believe
your
honor,
that
people
against
martin
which
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
the
proper
room.
it
has
been
adapted
only
by
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that
abolishes
all
illegal
evidence
because
i
cannot
believe
that
the
court
should
land
itself
to
illegal
conduct
and
a
part
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
but
i
am
not
asking
the
court
in
this
year
to
adopt
that
rule.
i
am
asking
this
court
to
adopt
a
rule
which
is
something
short
of
that
but
which
i
believe
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
will
be
an
adequate
deterrent
to
illegal
eavesdropping.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
it's
this
far
short,
your
honor
that
before
a
defendant
could
come
in
and
compel
that
kind
of
disclosure
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
proceeding
here
this
morning.
he
would
either
have
to
have
been
the
participant
in
a
conversation
which
was
invaded
or
he
would
have
to
have
been
the
owner
or
occupant
or
have
a
proprietary
interest
in
premises
which
were
invaded
or
he
himself
would've
had
to
be
the
subject
matter
of
the
conversation
which
was
illicitly
overheard
or
finally,
he
would
have
to
be
a
coconspirator
or
a
codefendant
of
the
person
who
fell
within
the
purview
of
that
particular
--
whether
or
not
named,
i
think
you
said
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
whether
or
not
named
i
said
because
i
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
because
otherwise,
there
could
be
a
ready
and
easy
circumvention
of
the
rule.
i
do
not
contend
for
a
rule
your
honor
as
the
government
suggests
which
would
permit
indiscriminate
roguing
through
the
government
files
to
find
some
illicit
conduct
on
behalf
of
some
federal
agency.
i
am
confining
it
to
this
and
i
say
the
best
capsule
i
summary
that
we
could
fashion
to
cover
all
of
those
things
in
one
short
pithy
phrase
and
i
hope
it's
not
an
over
simplification
is
to
give
standing
to
one
against
whom
whether
identified
at
the
time
or
not
the
search
of
the
government
agents
is
direct
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
i
say
if
the
search
was
directed
against
him
and
he's
named
is
a
codefendant,
yes.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes,
sir.
whether
the
codefendant
is
named
or
not?
mr.
edward
benett
williams
on
that
conversation,
it
would
have
to
be
turned
over
to
him
under
the
rule
for
which
we
contend.
if
these
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
otherwise,
your
honor
--
otherwise,
i
say,
we
cannot
get
effective
compliance
of
the
rule
outlying
electronic
surveillance.
it
will
still
become
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i'm
not
asking
that
your
honor
i
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i'm
sure
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i'm
asking
the
court
to
fashion
a
rule
of
standing
that
encompasses
the
interest
which
i
believe
need
to
be
served
if
we
are
to
have
an
effective
exclusionary
rule
with
respect
to
electronic
espionage
because
i
say
to
the
court
that
it
will
be
used
because
it
will
still
be
fruitful
and
beneficial
to
federal
agents
if
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well
i
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
except
we
are
not
going
to
stumble
into
the
pitfall
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
that
we
are
asking
to
go
to
the
department
of
justice
and
rummage
through
all
the
files
which
can
be
classified
as
evidence
garnered
illegally.
we
are
saying
that
before
we
have
a
right
to
have
a
disclosure
of
those
materials,
we
must
be
in
one
of
the
categories
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
but
you
have
to
lineate
let
me
in.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
when
they
process
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
in
all
of
this
discussion
that
we've
had
today,
every
single,
all
of
the
discussion
we
had
last
term,
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
good
faith
of
the
mystery
at
agency
while
assuming
that
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
good
faith
of
the
department
which
we
do
not
impute,
that
they
will
come
forward
under
the
doctrine
of
kolod
and
say,
"we
heard
john
jones
by
used
of
an
electronic
surveillance
conducted
in
san
francisco,
here's
the
conversation
mr.
jones,
make
the
most
of
it."
if
you
can
relate
it
to
your
prosecution,
we're
willing
to
have
any
evidence
clean
thereby
from
(inaudible).
if
the
government
doesn't
come
forward
and
make
that
concession,
of
course
it
goes
without
saying
that
john
jones
has
no
right,
no
way
to
vindicate
his
constitutional
rights
because
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
he'd
have
the
right
to
insist
on
it
but
he
would
--
whether
he
would
get
it
would
be
entirely
dependent
upon
the
good
faith
of
the
government.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well
the
government
under
kolod
has
an
obligation
as
i
understand
it
to
come
forward
with
any
evidence
which
relates
to
the
defendant
any
evidence
relating
to
the
defendant
which
has
been
seize
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
an
electronic
surveillance
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
if
kolod
has
complied
with,
the
government
would
come
forward
and
admit
it
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
but
if
it's
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
that
it
would
behoove
jones'
lawyer
to
ask
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
way
any
eavesdropping
vis-a-vis
jones
as
to
whether
he
was
heard,
whether
his
premises
were
invaded
or
whether
he
was
the
subject
matter
of
a
conversation
between
others
who
was
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
but
i'm
afraid
it
has
to
be
if
we're
going
to
effectively
deter
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
i
think
that
the
same
rules
would
apply
if
the
court
please
to
wiretapping
cases.
yes
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
no,
i
am
confining
all
of
my
discussion
and
all
of
my
contentions
to
the
area
with
which
we're
concerned
mr.
justice
harlan
which
is
bugging,
wiretapping
or
eavesdropping,
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
as
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes,
but
we
are
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
go
there.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i'm
asking
the
court
only
to
go
so
far
as
i
have
contended
in
cases
involving
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
from
the
briefs
that
had
been
filed
in
this
case,
and
from
the
oral
argument
of
last
term,
we
can
begin
a
consideration
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
court
from
the
premise
that
the
petitioner
alderisio's
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
have
been
violated
by
federal
agents
when
they
employed
electronic
surveillance
equipment
to
overhear
his
private
conversations.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
oh
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
if
they
overheard
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
no
sir.
i
do
not,
sir.
and
i
propose
to
develop
that
fully.
i
think,
so
long
as
he
had
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
premises
which
were
electronically
monitored
that
he
has
clear
standing
to
--
suppressed.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
whether
he
had
a
proprietary
interest
or
not,
i
believe
sir,
it's
immaterial
with
respect
to
his
own
conversations.
i
believe
that
it
is
material
with
respect
to
conversations
of
others
when
he
was
not
present.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
oh
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes,
sir.
and
i
must
say
to
footnote
your
honors
observation
that
i
was
surprised
and
i
use
the
word
surprised
consciously
as
understatement
to
hear
the
solicitor
general
say
that
alderisio
had
no
standing
with
respect
to
monitoring
premises
in
which
he
had
a
proprietary
interest
when
he
himself
was
not
present
because
in
the
very
brief
filed
by
the
government
at
page
21,
the
government
says,
"in
our
memorandum
filed
last
term,
we
assumed
that
a
criminal
defendant
would
have
standing
to
challenge
unconstitutional
electronic
surveillance
if
one,
he
was
a
participant
in
conversations
overheard
in
this
manner
or
two,
although
not
a
participant,
the
overhearing
occurred
in
premises
owned
by
him
or
in
which
he
had
some
other
interest
at
the
time,
we
add
here
to
this
position."
now
if
the
court
please,
what
is
the
government
saying
here?
it
says,
we
have
the
logs,
memoranda
and
records
resulting
from
this
illicit
electronic
surveillance.
and
we're
not
going
to
give
them
back
to
the
victim
of
this
electronic
surveillance,
rather,
we
are
proposing
a
procedure
by
which
we
make
a
confession
to
the
trial
judge
of
the
nature,
the
time,
the
place,
and
the
fruits
of
our
transgression
and
let
the
district
court
judge
evaluate
that
confession
and
determine
in
camera
ex
parte
what
is
arguably
relevant
to
the
pending
prosecution
and
what
is
the
reason
for
which
they
advance
this
procedure?
they
say
in
the
case
at
bar
because
these
logs,
memoranda,
and
records
may
contain
errant
gossip
without
claim
of
the
truth
and
injurious
to
third
persons.
so,
we
say
then
to
the
government
as
the
logical
next
question.
well,
what
about
those
logs,
records
and
memoranda
that
are
obviously
and
patently
and
palpably
not
injurious
to
third
persons.
and
what
does
the
government
say
to
that?
with
what
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
a
rather
cavalier
and
bizarre
disregard
for
consistency.
they
say,
"the
practical
problem
is
that
neither
the
government
nor
the
court
can
ever
now
with
certainty
when
disclosure
to
the
defendant
of
an
overheard
conversation
might
be
harmful
to
other
participants
in
the
conversation."
i
say
mutatis
mutandis
that
how
can
the
judge
know
whether
failure
to
disclose
the
logs,
memoranda,
and
records
of
the
overheard
conversation
might
be
harmful
to
the
defendant
in
the
vindication
of
his
constitutional
rights.
they
go
on
to
say
at
page
15,
there
are
situations
where
even
the
disclosure
of
a
conversation
that
is
innocuous
on
its
face
can
prejudice
third
defendants.
i
say
mutatis
mutandis
there
are
situations
where
conversations
which
are
perfectly
innocuous
on
their
face
may
be
lethal
in
suggesting
leads
to
evidence
gathered
by
law
enforcement
agencies
for
presentation
to
the
grand
jury
and
for
subsequent
presentation
to
the
trial
court.
they
say
at
page
15,
the
experience
of
the
department
of
justice
in
reviewing
cases
involving
electronic
surveillance
to
determine
when
disclosure
must
be
made
has
indicated
that
because
the
factual
situations
are
so
varied,
it
is
almost
impossible
to
draw
general
rule
of
disclosure
that
can
be
applied
to
a
broad
class
of
cases
and
will
avoid
the
possibility
of
injury
to
third
persons.
to
that
we
say
amen
and
we
say
that
it's
impossible
to
draw
a
rule
of
demarcation
that
will
avoid
through
an
in
camera
ex
parte
proceeding
that
will
avoid
injury
to
the
defendant
in
the
vindication
of
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
only
safe
course
says
the
government
at
page
15,
"we
submit
is
to
decline
the
order
disclosure
whatever
it
is
clear
that
nothing
in
the
materials
submitted
is
arguably
relevant
to
the
prosecution."
we
say
if
the
court
please
that
the
only
safe
course
when
we
are
talking
about
the
vindication
of
constitutional
rights
and
when
concededly
the
trial
judge
cannot
make
this
determination
in
camera
ex
parte
without
the
aid
of
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
is
to
make
these
conversations
which
had
been
illegally
seized
available
to
the
defendant
and
his
counsel.
we
say
if
the
court
please
that
the
constitution,
the
law
and
the
basic
rules
of
fair
play
require
the
disclosure
of
these
materials
to
the
victim
of
the
search.
if
the
court
please
as
was
pointed
out
earlier
this
morning,
it
couldn't
reasonably
be
argued
by
the
government
if
there
had
been
a
search
of
the
defendant's
premises,
a
ransacking
of
his
premises
and
a
seizure
of
his
papers
and
records,
and
letters.
it
couldn't
reasonably
be
argued
by
the
government
that
those
materials
which
were
seized
from
him
shouldn't
be
returned
to
him
but
rather
should
be
handed
up
to
a
district
court
judge
to
determine
whether
any
of
them
had
arguable
relevancy
to
the
pending
prosecution.
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
same
basic
principle
applies
with
respect
to
conversations
which
are
protected
within
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
right.
let
me
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
may
i
address
myself
to
the
question
which
i
understand
your
honor
has
raised.
to
concretize
it,
the
case
where
the
defendant
whose
premises
are
electronically
monitored,
and
the
monitoring
picks
up
conversations
of
a
and
b
when
the
defendant
is
not
present
and
the
question
as
i
understand
posed
by
your
honor
is,
what's
the
defendant's
standing
to
get
those
conversations
and
i
suggest
that
there
are
competing
social
interests
and
there
are
competing
legal
interests.
what
are
they?
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
a
defendant
who
has
been
charged
with
a
criminal
offense
who
is
seeking
to
vindicate
a
constitutional
right.
we
have
here
a
situation
where
the
government
has
violated
his
fourth
amendment
rights
concededly
by
electronically
invading
premises
in
which
he
has
a
proprietary
interest.
as
a
result
of
that
electronic
invasion,
they
have
ripped
certain
benefits,
they
have
ripped
certain
fruits,
they
have
gathered
certain
evidence
which
they
proposed
to
offer
against
him
because
they
are
saying
you
have
no
standing,
and
it
was
not
your
conversation
sir.
on
the
other
hand,
you'll
have
the
competing
social
value
of
the
two
persons
who
thought
they
were
talking
privately
maybe
even
against
the
defendant
himself.
now,
what
is
their
right?
we
are
weighing
a
common
law
right
to
privacy
of
these
people
against
a
constitutional
right
of
the
defendant.
what
can
be
involved
in
that
common
law
right
to
privacy?
it
may
be
a
pecuniary
interest,
well
if
it's
a
pecuniary
interest,
i'm
sure
the
court
will
agree
that
it
should
be
subordinated
to
the
defendant's
constitutional
right
and
the
right
to
privacy
can
be
safe
guarded
effectively
i
suggest
to
the
court
insofar
as
protective
orders
can
be
fashioned
and
tailored
by
the
trial
judge
to
protect
those
third
persons
from
unnecessary
disclosure.
and
it's
been
our
experience,
if
the
court
please,
that
in
everyone
of
the
hearings
which
have
been
conducted
as
a
result
of
an
illicit
electronic
surveillance,
the
defendant
himself
has
asked
for
protective
orders
because
he
does
not
want
to
proliferate
the
damage
resulting
from
the
government's
invasion
of
his
privacy
and
so
to
can
protective
orders
be
fashioned
to
protect
insofar
as
possible
the
right
to
privacy
from
further
damage
as
far
as
third
persons
are
concerned.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
let's
make
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
but
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
pinpointed
the
situation
that
may
constitute
one-tenth
of
100%
of
the
cases
and
i
think
that
even
in
that
situation
that
the
rights
of
the
participants
in
the
conversation
can
be
effectively
safeguarded.
if
in
fact,
we
have
a
realization
of
the
bizarre
hypothesis
that
two
people
on
the
premises
are
talking
about
eliminating
the
proprietor.
then
and
in
that
case,
the
government
i
suggest
to
the
court
has
the
choice
of
providing
those
persons
with
the
same
kind
of
protection
that
it
provides
to
material
witnesses
in
many
cases
where
these
interests
are
at
stake
or
alternatively,
if
it
does
not
wish
to
do
that
and
wants
to
exalt
their
rights
over
and
above
the
interest
of
the
sovereignty
to
go
forth
with
the
prosecution.
they
can
dismiss
the
prosecution
but
i
do
suggest
your
honor,
that
it
is
not
practical,
it
is
not
feasible,
it
is
not
possible
for
a
trial
judge
sitting
in
camera
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
any
of
the
logs,
memoranda,
or
materials
resulting
from
the
electronic
surveillance
where
used
by
the
government
in
developing
leads.
i
want
to
give
the
court
just
one
illustration
of
that
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
we
have
a
case
where
there
is
a
boilerplate
indictment
for
income
tax
evasion
charging
the
defendant
in
the
typical
language
with
evading
taxes
for
a
given
year.
the
only
thing
they
ever
change
in
those
indictments
of
the
year
and
the
amounts
of
money.
now,
unlike
jenks
act
materials
if
the
court
please,
unlike
grand
jury
testimony,
if
the
court
please,
when
we
talk
about
a
trial
judge
looking
at
the
large
memoranda
and
records
of
an
electronic
surveillance,
we're
talking
about
packing
cases
filled
with
materials,
not
sheets
of
paper
and
we're
asking
a
trial
judge
to
build
a
superhuman
task
of
judge
deposing
packing
cases
of
electronically
monitored
conversations
against
the
skill
of
(inaudible)
of
a
criminal
indictment
using
the
wildest
lights
of
his
imaginative
powers
as
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
to
determine
whether
the
government
seize
on
any
of
those
conversations
and
developed
a
lead.
here's
the
case
where
the
trial
judge
spent
four
weeks
reading
the
documents.
they
were
so
voluminous
that
he
had
to
delegate
the
reading
to
another
judge
who
helped
him
and
together
they
took
four
weeks
reading
them
and
they
came
up
with
the
answer
which
you
would
expect
that
there
was
nothing
that
they
could
find
relevant.
but
when
the
trial
of
the
case
came
on,
this
conversation
which
i
submit
no
one
could've
determined
was
arguably
relevant
to
the
indictment
turned
out
to
be
the
origin
of
a
lethal
chain
of
proof.
what
is
the
conversation?
"how
are
you?"
it's
one
end
of
a
phone
conversation.
"you're
coming
on
twa?"
"yes."
"i'll
put
you
into
the
sands.
i'll
get
a
hold
of
cliff,
i'll
call
right
now.
charlie
won't
be
there,
his
wife
is
being
operated
on.
i'll
have
a
room
there
for
you
and
your
wife.
you're
going
to
stay
through
sandy.
okay
buddy."
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
no
trial
judge
sitting
before
trial
or
after
he
had
heard
all
of
the
proof
in
a
three-week
trial
could
have
determined
in
camera
ex
parte
that
that
was
as
it
turned
out
to
be
the
origin
of
a
line
of
proof
that
was
devastating.
now,
what
is
more
if
the
court
please?
when
this
court
and
other
courts
fashion
rules
designed
to
deter
lawless
law
enforcement,
we
find
that
more
sophisticated
methods
or
device
to
countervail
the
rules
of
disclosure.
for
example,
when
the
jenks
decision
came
down
and
when
the
jenks
statute
was
subsequently
enacted
by
the
congress,
we
found
well
motivated
law
enforcement
officers
zealous
in
the
pursuit
of
their
duties
who
found
ways
to
put
on
paper
in
narrative
form
statements
that
were
not
susceptible
to
turnover
under
jenks.
when
the
dennis
case
came
down,
and
grand
jury
testimony
was
ordered
to
be
turned
over
to
the
defense
after
the
direct
testimony,
we
found
and
our
finding
across
the
country
well-meaning
and
zealous,
able,
competent
prosecutors
who
seek
to
avoid
this
procedure
with
advantage
to
the
defendant
by
having
grand
jury
minutes
no
longer
transcribed.
now,
in
this
instance,
when
we
have
a
kolod
rule,
what
has
happen?
what
can
happen?
it
isn't
any
longer
necessary,
if
the
court
please,
to
make
logs,
memoranda,
or
records
of
electronically
monitored
conversations.
we
cite
in
our
brief
a
situation
where
the
age
in
charge
of
the
investigation
monitored
the
premises
of
the
suspect
24
hours
a
day.
he
listens
to
the
conversations
each
day
and
if
he
saw
anything
in
those
conversations
which
he
believed
to
be
of
interest
to
him,
he
would
telephone
to
another
field
office.
the
information
gleamed
and
he
would
ask
field
operatives
to
rundown
those
leads
and
the
basis
of
the
lead
would
be
ascribed
to
a
confidential
informant
protected
from
disclosure
by
mccray
against
illinois
and
a
lead
would
be
developed.
a
file
would
be
created
and
there
would
be
nothing,
nothing
of
a
written
nature
to
turnover
to
the
trial
judge
for
an
in
camera
ex
parte
examination
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
fruitful
violation
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
so,
i
suggest
to
court
that
it
is
not
possible
for
a
defendant
to
vindicate
his
constitutional
rights
in
the
area
of
electronic
surveillance
without
an
adversary
hearing
of
full
open
adversary
hearing
and
without
a
disclosure
to
him
of
the
nature
of
the
surveillance,
the
time
of
the
surveillance,
the
place
of
the
surveillance
and
the
fruits
of
the
surveillance.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
i
think
i
could
explain
myself
on
that
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
understand
you
take
questions.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
like
to
answer
both
the
questions
suppose.
i
don't
think
the
telephone
company
had
any
right
because
at
least
that
phone
booth
for
the
purpose
to
phone
the
katz.
he
was
the
one
whose
proprietary
interest
was
invaded.
but
on
the
first
question
that
you
ask,
your
honor
says
that
i
say
that
c's
constitutional
rights
were
invaded
but
with
respect
to
a
and
b,
there's
only
a
common
law
right
to
privacy.
i
do
say
that.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
a
and
b's
constitutional
rights
have
already
been
invaded
by
the
government
just
as
c's
but
when
we
come
to
the
question
posed
by
the
government
as
to
whether
a
and
b's
conversations
which
have
already
been
victimize
by
an
unconstitutional
search
should
be
made
available
to
c,
the
defendant,
then
and
in
that
case
as
between
a,
b,
c.
we're
not
talking
about
constitutional
rights,
we
are
then
talking
about
a
right
to
privacy
which
they
have
against
him
with
respect
to
conversations
which
have
already
been
seized
unconstitutionally
and
i
say
that
their
right
to
privacy
as
again
c
must
be
subordinated
to
his
constitutional
right
to
vindicate
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
good
at
--
here
to
denigrate
the
fact
that
a
and
b's
constitutional
rights
had
been
invaded
but
that's
accomplished
fact.
fortunately
for
them,
they're
not
defendants.
c
is
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
right.
the
only
--
the
difference
is
that
this
is
the
post
indictment
staged
in
c.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
right.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
right.
the
difference
in
the
cases
your
honor
is
that
c
is
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
who
has
a
right
not
to
be
convicted
by
illegally
obtained
evidence.
in
the
case
that
you
hypothesized
a
and
c
are
not
the
defendants
and
in
this
frame
of
reference,
i
say
that
in
the
hierarchy
values
that
the
court
should
place
a
and
b's
right
subordinate
to
c's.
if
a
and
b
were
indicted
and
they
were
seeking
the
vindication
of
their
constitutional
rights
and
another
frame
of
reference,
i
would
have
a
different
answer
for
you.
but
i
stand
by
what
i
said
earlier
mr.
justice
stewart
that
having
taken
as
the
fact,
the
young
constitutional
invasion
of
the
rights
of
all
three
that
as
between
a,
b,
and
c,
we
are
really
talking
about
a
common
law
right
to
privacy,
a,
b,
against
c
and
that
can
be
safeguarded
insofar
as
it's
practical
for
the
vindication
of
c's
right
by
a
protective
order
that
inhibits
both
c
and
his
counsel
from
making
unnecessary
disclosure
of
the
contents
of
that
conversation.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
in
a
word
your
honor,
the
government
illegally
and
unconstitutionally
listened
to
conversations
which
they
believe
where
being
privately
held
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
katz,
silverman,
wong
sun
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
by
c's
consent,
no
sir,
not
by
c's
consent.
it
was
a
subject
to
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
if
i
understand
your
question,
are
you
asking
whether
c
could
give
consent
to
the
government
to
electronically
monitor
a
and
b's
conversation
if
it
was
reasonably
foreseeable
to
them
that
their
privacy
was
not
being
invaded,
i
would
say
not
sir.
because
i
think
that
consent,
if
it
is
to
be
an
effective
way
or
it
must
be
limited
to
one
of
the
participants
in
the
conversation
where
the
parties
to
the
conversation
can
unreasonably
foresee
that
they're
going
to
be
overheard
in
the
normal
course
of
things.
now,
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
standing
that
has
been
raised
here,
it
is
our
contention
and
i
have,
i
think
articulated
that
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
that
alderisio
has
standing
with
respect
to
conversations
heard
on
his
premises
not
withstanding
the
fact
hat
he
was
not
present,
i
read
page
21
of
the
solicitor's
brief
as
a
concession
of
that
position
and
i
think
a
concession
is
necessary
for
the
simple
reason
that
if
we
are
to
make
the
fruits
of
an
unconstitutional
invasion
for
one's
premises
inadmissible,
it
follows
clearly
that
we
must
make
the
conversation
seized
on
alderisio's
premises
inadmissible
against
him.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
to
answer
your
question,
as
sharply
as
it
was
posed
your
honor,
yes,
i
would
take
that
position
and
i
underscore,
that
section
of
your
question
which
said
in
which
he
had
no
interest
in.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
as
we
develop
the
question
of
standing
through
the
warning
here
your
honor,
it
is
ultimately
our
position
that
a
person
aggrieved
within
the
purview
of
an
electronic
surveillance
in
rule
41
is
one
against
whom
the
search
is
directed
whether
he
is
identified
or
unidentified
at
the
time
of
the
search.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
right
your
honor,
subject
to
one
qualification
which
i'm
going
to
develop
and
i
give,
i
think
that
a
co-defendant
stands
in
the
shoes
of
his
co-defendant
with
respect
to
his
right.
a
co-conspirator
stands
in
the
shoes
of
his
co-conspirator
with
respect
to
this
right.
so,
in
the
case
for
example
of
alderman
against
whom
the
government
says
it
conducted
no
surveillance
and
whose
premises
it
says
it
did
not
invade,
we
nonetheless
say
if
the
court
please
that
since
this
was
an
indictment
sounding
in
conspiracy
and
since
the
government
took
the
procedure
advantages
that
flow
from
a
conspiracy
case
namely
the
imputation
of
the
acts
and
declarations
of
alderisio
to
alderman
and
alderman
to
alderisio
and
the
unindicted
conspirators
to
each.
since
it
takes
the
partnership
theory
and
lays
all
the
duties
of
a
partnership
on
each
of
the
co-conspirators,
we
say
that
when
you
take
that
theory
to
the
limits
of
its
logic,
you
have
to
give
them
the
rights
of
partners
also.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
would
accept
what
your
honor
just
said
with
the
elimination
of
the
advert.
i
think
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
think
and
i
say
that
if
the
time
has
come
that
concept
of
standing
must
be
expanded
your
honor
if
we
are
going
to
fashion
a
rule
that
will
deter
electronic
surveillance
because
i
suggest
that
the
rule
for
which
the
government
contends
is
now
our
case.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
if
he
has
--
if
neither
his
conversation
is
heard.
if
his
premises
are
not
invaded,
if
he
is
not
the
subject
matter
of
the
conversation
and
if
he
is
not
a
co-defendant
with
one
whose
conversation
or
premises
were
invaded,
then
i
say
he
does
not
have
standing.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
another
ingredient
and
i
think
that
is
the
ingredient
on
which
we
part
company
with
the
government
in
this
proceeding
as
i
understand
their
briefs.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
this
case
and
the
next
case
said
is
ivanov
and
i
hope
to
develop
the
question
of
standing
fully
in
that
companion
case
to
this.
so
i
will
defer
with
the
court's
indulgence
my
discussion
of
standing
until
that
case
is
called.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner,
igor
ivanov,
a
citizen
of
the
soviet
union
and
employee
of
amtorg,
a
soviet
trading
company
stands
convicted
of
a
conspiracy
to
commit
espionage
against
the
united
states
under
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
section
794.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
the
third
circuit,
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
here
and
without
detailing
the
intermediate
pleadings,
between
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
oral
argument,
it's
surprising
to
say
that
pursuant
to
the
order
in
the
kolod
case,
the
government
conceded
that
certiorari
should
be
granted
that
there
should
be
a
remand
that
the
district
court
for
an
in
camera
ex
parte
hearing
with
respect
to
electronic
surveillances
conducted
in
that
case.
now,
in
the
brief
filed
in
this
court
in
ivanov,
the
government
says
that
conversations
of
each
of
the
petitioners
in
these
cases
were
overheard
by
the
use
of
the
electronic
surveillance
equipment
and
footnoted
is
this
statement.
in
some
of
the
instances,
the
installation
had
been
specifically
approved
by
the
then
attorney
general.
in
others,
the
equipment
was
installed
under
a
broader
grant
of
authority
to
the
fbi
and
affected
the
time
which
did
not
require
specific
authorization.
experience
would
indicate
to
us,
i
submit
that
that
is
a
concession
of
both
wiretapping
and
eavesdropping
in
this
case.
now,
this
case
is
significantly
different
from
the
case
just
argued
at
bar
because
the
government
seriously
averse
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
national
security
consideration
to
be
waived
in
the
balance
of
competing
social
interest.
i
think
it's
equally
significant,
if
the
court
please
if
i
may
say
so
at
the
outset
of
this
argument
that
the
government
by
that
reason
does
not
ask
for
different
treatment
between
alderman
and
ivanov.
it
asks
for
precisely
the
same
treatment,
it
asks
for
in
camera
ex
parte
proceedings
with
respect
to
the
logs
electronic
--
the
logs
memorandum
records
of
the
electronic
surveillance
in
each.
now,
first
of
all,
it
is
our
position
as
the
court
please
that
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
does
not
make
a
division
among
the
various
kinds
of
crime.
it
does
not
draw
a
line
of
demarcation
and
the
founding
fathers
when
the
constitution
was
written
and
when
the
american
bill
of
rights
were
forged
understood
quite
clearly
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
various
types
of
crime.
they
gave
recognition
to
this
in
article
3,
section
3
of
the
constitution
when
they
defined
treason
and
they
prescribed
the
quantum
and
quality
of
proof
necessary
for
a
treason
conviction.
but
they
didn't
make
any
exception
in
the
fourth
amendment
with
respect
to
spy
catchers
or
subversive
hunters.
now,
it's
next
to
our
position,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
certifies
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
national
security
consideration
which
should
excuse
the
united
states
from
making
a
disclosure
with
respect
to
the
nature,
the
time,
the
place,
or
the
fruits
of
an
electronic
surveillance
illegally
conducted,
we
say
he
should
be
excused,
provided
he
consents
to
a
dismissal
of
the
prosecution
under
the
time-honored
principle
of
kaplan
against
the
united
states
which
was
decided
in
1950,
an
opinion
by
judge
learned
hand
which
was
forced
where
with
the
facts
in
the
case
at
bar.
there
was
electronic
surveillance,
there
was
an
espionage
case,
there
was
an
alleged
spy,
a
convicted
spy
and
the
premise
was
articulated
there
that
the
government
had
a
choice
of
making
a
full
disclosure
to
the
defendant
for
the
vindication
of
our
constitutional
rights
or
dismissing,
the
government
dismissed.
now,
that
case
and
i
think
it's
significant
to
note
has
stood
on
a
sale
by
the
government
for
18
years
until
argument
was
heard
in
this
case
last
term
and
that
case
was
simply
a
repetition
of
the
doctrine
articulated
also
by
the
second
circuit
in
united
states
against
anderson.
so
it's
our
position,
if
the
court
please,
reduced
to
its
essence
that
the
concept
national
security
should
not
be
the
talisman
for
a
pro
tanto
suspension
of
due
process
of
law
or
of
any
of
the
rights
guaranteed
to
an
accused
in
a
criminal
case.
if,
in
the
conduct
of
relationships
between
governments
in
our
time,
it
has
become
the
custom
or
it
has
become
a
necessity
to
engage
in
wiretapping
or
eavesdropping
or
dissembling
or
purloining
or
burglarizing
or
even
killing,
it
is
not
our
argument
in
this
court
today
that
the
executive
branch
should
be
manacled
or
impeded
or
harassed
in
the
conduct
of
relationships
with
other
governments.
it
is
our
argument
here
today
that
at
least
the
federal
courts
should
be
a
sanctuary
in
the
jungle,
and
that
these
morals
and
that
these
mores
should
not
be
imported
into
the
american
judiciary
system
and
that
the
fruits
of
this
kind
of
conduct
should
not
become
evidence
in
a
criminal
case
brought
by
the
sovereign
power
against
an
accused,
nor
should
leads
derived
from
this
kind
of
conduct
be
available
to
the
prosecutor
in
a
criminal
case
brought
by
the
sovereign
power.
in
essence,
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
in
this
case,
it's
asserting
its
right
to
be
let
alone
and
to
that
we
say
?amen?,
so
long
as
the
evidence
is
not
offered
in
a
federal
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
think
that
is
the
government's
position
your
honor,
the
government's
position
is
the
same
in
this
case
as
it
is
in
the
alderman
case
and
we
say
that
just
as
it
is
impossible
for
this
kind
of
determination
to
be
made
in
the
alderman
case
it's
equally
impossible
for
this
kind
of
determination
to
be
made
in
camera
ex
parte
why
the
judge
and
even
though
the
issue
may
affect
national
security
but
the
government
has
argued
in
its
brief
at
great
lengths
that
we
are
seeking
to
impede
the
government
in
assuring
the
national
security
and
i
say
that
we
are
not.
i
say
that
we
are
not
asking
that
any
rules
be
fashioned
to
impede
or
harass
the
government
in
the
conduct
of
its
affairs
with
other
governments
or
in
the
conduct
of
its
duty
to
preserve
the
national
security.
we
are
asking
for
a
much
narrower
rule.
we
are
asking
that
this
kind
of
evidence
not
be
offered
in
court
and
we
are
saying
that
the
same
rules
should
pertain
to
this
kind
of
evidence
as
obtains
with
respect
to
any
other
kind
of
evidence
that
there
should
be
a
disclosure.
the
disclosure
maybe
made
under
rule
16
as
the
disclosure
maybe
made
and
any
other
kind
of
case
to
eliminate
a
necessary
dissemination
of
the
information
so
that
our
position
if
the
court
please
is
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
disclosure
under
appropriate
protective
orders
and
he
has
the
right
to
disclosure
to
his
counsel
under
appropriate
protective
orders
regardless
of
what
the
nature
of
the
information
may
be,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
is
contended
by
the
government
that
it
affects
national
security
unless
the
government
is
willing
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
in
which
case
we
agree
that
it
should
be
dealt.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
don't
read
them
as
making
that
distinction
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
read
them
as
asking
for
the
same
kind
of
proceeding
in
each
case.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
and
i
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
don't
read
this
as
contending
that.
they
may
contend
it
orally
your
honor.
i
read
them
as
asking
for
the
same
kind
of
hearing
and
i
also
contend
if
court
--
the
court
please
that
protective
orders
can
be
fashioned
here
just
as
in
the
alderman
case
and
if
we
are
driven
to
the
unhappy
conclusion
that
the
alleged
spy
goes
free,
then
i
think
we
can
draw
some
consolation
from
the
history
of
the
last
three
decades
that
in
three
decades
of
recorded
federal
jurisprudence
during
which
there
were
three
wardens,
we
have
only
one
instance
of
an
averred
spy
going
free
in
this
frame
of
reference
and
she
was
the
defendant
in
the
case
to
which
i
alluded
to
kaplan
case,
and
i
think
we
could
also
get
a
measure
of
consolation
from
the
fact
that
of
all
the
crimes
in
federal
jurisprudence,
the
lowest
amount
of
recidivism
takes
place
in
the
area
of
espionage
because
once
a
spy
is
exposed,
he
is
by
and
large
diffused.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes.
there
are
two
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
three
others
who
were
soviet
nationals
who
had
diplomatic
status
enough
to
go
back
to
the
soviet
union
with
our
blessing.
now
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
problems
that
this
court
has
propounded
on
standing
in
this
case
and
the
court
has
propounded
some
hard
questions
with
respect
to
the
subject
of
standing
in
this
case.
now
for
purposes
of
standing,
we
do
contend
in
capsulize
form
that
a
person
agreed
within
the
purview
of
rule
41
is
one
against
whom
the
search
--
the
illicit
search
is
directed
whether
he's
known
or
unknown
at
the
time.
we
say
if
the
court
please
that
for
purposes
of
standing,
the
concept
must
be
considered
under
rule
describing
an
aggrieved
person.
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
it
must
considered
against
the
fact
ground
of
an
age
in
which
electronic
surveillance
has
become
a
widespread
investigative
technique
and
we
must
consider
it
in
the
light
of
the
philosophical
rational
for
the
federal
exclusionary
rule.
now,
rational
in
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
has
been
articulated
many
times
by
many
courts
as
being
simply
that
the
courts
recoil
at
the
philosophic
concept
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
designed
as
a
deterrent
to
lawless
law
enforcement.
it's
designed
to
discourage
it
and
to
effect
compliance
with
the
agents
of
the
sovereign
power
with
the
law.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
rule
on
standing
for
which
the
government
contends
is
--
are
kept
and
that
it
is
ineffective
against
this
black
ground
during
the
early
evolution
of
cases
under
the
fourth
amendment
by
and
large,
we
were
concerned
with
cases
where
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights
had
been
invaded
by
virtue
of
the
search
of
his
premises
and
the
seizure
of
his
papers
and
his
effects
so
that
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
there
was
not
a
serious
problem
of
standing
but
we
have
passed
that
here
on
and
we
now
have
an
era
where
electronic
surveillance
is
used
in
the
following
manner
as
is
illustrated
by
many
instances
in
our
papers.
the
government
through
its
agents
does
not
listen
to
the
suspect,
it
does
not
invade
his
premises
electronically
by
planting
an
electronic
bug
there
rather
in
a
very
careful
selective
manner,
it
listens
to
the
conversations
of
his
relatives
and
friends
and
associates,
and
it
invades
the
premises
of
his
relatives
and
friends
and
associates,
and
it
gathers
criminal
intelligence
by
this
fact
which
it
indexes
and
computerizes
and
makes
dossiers
until
such
time
as
it
has
by
utilizing
these
leads
developed
a
situation
wherein
an
indictment
can
be
secured
by
the
presentation
of
some
of
these
evidence
to
a
grand
jury
and
subsequently
a
conviction
can
be
obtained
by
the
use
of
the
same
evidence
and
that
the
suspect
defendant
is
left
without
a
remedy
because
the
government
contends
he
was
not
victimized
because
he
was
not
heard
and
because
no
premises
in
which
he
had
a
proprietary
interest
where
invaded.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
government's
position
on
standing
in
this
case
with
respect
to
electronic
surveillance
is
like
solomon's
approach
to
the
baby,
cut
it
in
half!
says
the
government,
there
are
two
competing
social
interests.
one,
that
the
culprit
should
not
go
free,
society
has
a
major
interest
in
this.
the
other,
is
that
there
should
be
a
deterrence
in
illegal
methods
of
law
enforcement,
the
government's
proposal
would
satisfy
neither
competing
social
interest,
why,
because
it
says
that
a
selected
class
of
culprits
should
go
free,
those
who
fall
within
their
concept
of
the
term
standing
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
green
light
should
be
flashed
for
a
continuation
of
illicit
electronic
surveillance
because
this
kind
of
activity
can
remain
tremendously
fruitful
and
beneficial
in
the
gathering
of
criminal
intelligence
without
giving
the
ultimate
victim
a
status
to
object.
now
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
time
has
come
for
standing
to
be
given
vis-à-vis
electronic
surveillances
to
the
following:
one,
to
those
whose
conversations
are
illicitly
listened
to
and
the
government
does
not
gainsay
this.
two,
to
those
persons
whose
premises
are
illegally
invaded
by
electronic
eavesdropping
equipment
and
as
i
read
the
government's
brief
at
page
21
in
the
alderman
case,
it
clearly
does
not
gainsay
this,
of
course.
as
i
previously
read
to
the
court,
the
government
says
it
adheres
to
the
position
that
a
defendant
though
not
a
participant,
if
the
overhearing
occurred
on
premises
owned
by
him
or
in
which
he
had
some
interests,
he
has
a
standing.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
one
who
is
the
subject
matter
of
an
overhearing
illegal
in
nature
must
have
standing
if
illicit
electronic
surveillance
is
to
be
deterred
by
federal
agents
and
finally,
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes,
sir.
finally,
i
say
this,
and
this
sounds
terribly
much
like
a
simplistic
approach
to
the
problem
and
assure
the
court
that
it
is
not
a
simplistic
approach
to
the
problem.
i
assure
you
that
consideration
has
been
given
to
all
of
the
competing
social
and
legal
interest
in
making
the
state.
i
believe
that
standing
must
be
given
to
a
codefendant
in
a
criminal
case
whether
he'd
be
named
as
a
coconspirator
or
not
and
i
say
this
first
of
all,
because
it
is
hard
to
conceive
that
defendants
can
be
joined
in
a
criminal
case
in
the
federal
courts
under
rule
8
which
provides
for
joinder
of
defendants,
unless
there
be
what
could
have
been
averred
to
be
a
conspiracy.
why?
because
the
rule
provides
that
they
must
have
been
engaged
in
an
act
or
series
of
acts
or
transaction
or
series
of
transactions
constituting
an
offense.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
suggest
--
suppose
he's
as
a
defendant
being
separately
prosecuted
in
connection
with
the
same
transactions
as
not
a
codefendant?
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
that's
why
your
honor
we
are
driven
--
we
are
driven
in
order
to
avoid
this
kind
of
circumvention,
we
are
driven
to
say
that
the
overall
position
is
whether
or
the
defendant
is
that
he
has
standing
if
the
search
was
a
search
directed
against
him.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
don't
to
want
to
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
don't
want,
if
the
court
please
or
anyone
to
be
able
to
do
by
indirection
that
which
is
inhibited
directly
and
if
the
prosecutor
by
the
simple
device
of
not
joining
two
persons
in
the
same
prosecution
but
it's
averred
their
proper
concept
of
standing,
then
i
would
be
oppose
to
that
and
that's
why
i
suggest
your
honor
as
an
umbrella
on
which,
under
which
to
gather
all
of
the
kinds
of
electronic
surveillance,
the
fruits
of
which
should
be
excluded.
the
rule
that
a
person
agreed
within
rule
41
is
a
person
against
whom
the
electronic
surveillance
was
directed
and
we
all
know
that
when
an
electronic
surveillance
is
directed
against
the
first,
it
is
not
only
against
him
but
it
is
against
those
engaged
in
the
illicit
enterprise
with
him
whether
identified
or
unidentified
at
the
time
when
there
is
a
monitoring,
the
government
is
not
just
interested
in
what
it
hears
about
it
wants
to
know
about
his
business
associates
and
friends
and
acquaintances.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i've
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
in
this
case,
i
don't
have
to
go
to
that
far,
i
believe
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
believe
your
honor,
that
people
against
martin
which
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
the
proper
room.
it
has
been
adapted
only
by
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that
abolishes
all
illegal
evidence
because
i
cannot
believe
that
the
court
should
land
itself
to
illegal
conduct
and
a
part
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
but
i
am
not
asking
the
court
in
this
year
to
adopt
that
rule.
i
am
asking
this
court
to
adopt
a
rule
which
is
something
short
of
that
but
which
i
believe
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
will
be
an
adequate
deterrent
to
illegal
eavesdropping.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
it's
this
far
short,
your
honor
that
before
a
defendant
could
come
in
and
compel
that
kind
of
disclosure
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
proceeding
here
this
morning.
he
would
either
have
to
have
been
the
participant
in
a
conversation
which
was
invaded
or
he
would
have
to
have
been
the
owner
or
occupant
or
have
a
proprietary
interest
in
premises
which
were
invaded
or
he
himself
would've
had
to
be
the
subject
matter
of
the
conversation
which
was
illicitly
overheard
or
finally,
he
would
have
to
be
a
coconspirator
or
a
codefendant
of
the
person
who
fell
within
the
purview
of
that
particular
--
whether
or
not
named,
i
think
you
said
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
whether
or
not
named
i
said
because
i
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
because
otherwise,
there
could
be
a
ready
and
easy
circumvention
of
the
rule.
i
do
not
contend
for
a
rule
your
honor
as
the
government
suggests
which
would
permit
indiscriminate
roguing
through
the
government
files
to
find
some
illicit
conduct
on
behalf
of
some
federal
agency.
i
am
confining
it
to
this
and
i
say
the
best
capsule
i
summary
that
we
could
fashion
to
cover
all
of
those
things
in
one
short
pithy
phrase
and
i
hope
it's
not
an
over
simplification
is
to
give
standing
to
one
against
whom
whether
identified
at
the
time
or
not
the
search
of
the
government
agents
is
direct
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
i
say
if
the
search
was
directed
against
him
and
he's
named
is
a
codefendant,
yes.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes,
sir.
whether
the
codefendant
is
named
or
not?
mr.
edward
benett
williams
on
that
conversation,
it
would
have
to
be
turned
over
to
him
under
the
rule
for
which
we
contend.
if
these
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
otherwise,
your
honor
--
otherwise,
i
say,
we
cannot
get
effective
compliance
of
the
rule
outlying
electronic
surveillance.
it
will
still
become
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i'm
not
asking
that
your
honor
i
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i'm
sure
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i'm
asking
the
court
to
fashion
a
rule
of
standing
that
encompasses
the
interest
which
i
believe
need
to
be
served
if
we
are
to
have
an
effective
exclusionary
rule
with
respect
to
electronic
espionage
because
i
say
to
the
court
that
it
will
be
used
because
it
will
still
be
fruitful
and
beneficial
to
federal
agents
if
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well
i
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
except
we
are
not
going
to
stumble
into
the
pitfall
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
that
we
are
asking
to
go
to
the
department
of
justice
and
rummage
through
all
the
files
which
can
be
classified
as
evidence
garnered
illegally.
we
are
saying
that
before
we
have
a
right
to
have
a
disclosure
of
those
materials,
we
must
be
in
one
of
the
categories
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
but
you
have
to
lineate
let
me
in.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
when
they
process
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
in
all
of
this
discussion
that
we've
had
today,
every
single,
all
of
the
discussion
we
had
last
term,
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
good
faith
of
the
mystery
at
agency
while
assuming
that
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
good
faith
of
the
department
which
we
do
not
impute,
that
they
will
come
forward
under
the
doctrine
of
kolod
and
say,
"we
heard
john
jones
by
used
of
an
electronic
surveillance
conducted
in
san
francisco,
here's
the
conversation
mr.
jones,
make
the
most
of
it."
if
you
can
relate
it
to
your
prosecution,
we're
willing
to
have
any
evidence
clean
thereby
from
(inaudible).
if
the
government
doesn't
come
forward
and
make
that
concession,
of
course
it
goes
without
saying
that
john
jones
has
no
right,
no
way
to
vindicate
his
constitutional
rights
because
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
he'd
have
the
right
to
insist
on
it
but
he
would
--
whether
he
would
get
it
would
be
entirely
dependent
upon
the
good
faith
of
the
government.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well
the
government
under
kolod
has
an
obligation
as
i
understand
it
to
come
forward
with
any
evidence
which
relates
to
the
defendant
any
evidence
relating
to
the
defendant
which
has
been
seize
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
an
electronic
surveillance
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
if
kolod
has
complied
with,
the
government
would
come
forward
and
admit
it
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
but
if
it's
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
that
it
would
behoove
jones'
lawyer
to
ask
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
way
any
eavesdropping
vis-a-vis
jones
as
to
whether
he
was
heard,
whether
his
premises
were
invaded
or
whether
he
was
the
subject
matter
of
a
conversation
between
others
who
was
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
but
i'm
afraid
it
has
to
be
if
we're
going
to
effectively
deter
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
i
think
that
the
same
rules
would
apply
if
the
court
please
to
wiretapping
cases.
yes
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
no,
i
am
confining
all
of
my
discussion
and
all
of
my
contentions
to
the
area
with
which
we're
concerned
mr.
justice
harlan
which
is
bugging,
wiretapping
or
eavesdropping,
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
as
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes,
but
we
are
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
go
there.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i'm
asking
the
court
only
to
go
so
far
as
i
have
contended
in
cases
involving
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
from
the
briefs
that
had
been
filed
in
this
case,
and
from
the
oral
argument
of
last
term,
we
can
begin
a
consideration
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
court
from
the
premise
that
the
petitioner
alderisio's
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
have
been
violated
by
federal
agents
when
they
employed
electronic
surveillance
equipment
to
overhear
his
private
conversations.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
oh
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
if
they
overheard
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
no
sir.
i
do
not,
sir.
and
i
propose
to
develop
that
fully.
i
think,
so
long
as
he
had
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
premises
which
were
electronically
monitored
that
he
has
clear
standing
to
--
suppressed.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
whether
he
had
a
proprietary
interest
or
not,
i
believe
sir,
it's
immaterial
with
respect
to
his
own
conversations.
i
believe
that
it
is
material
with
respect
to
conversations
of
others
when
he
was
not
present.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
oh
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes,
sir.
and
i
must
say
to
footnote
your
honors
observation
that
i
was
surprised
and
i
use
the
word
surprised
consciously
as
understatement
to
hear
the
solicitor
general
say
that
alderisio
had
no
standing
with
respect
to
monitoring
premises
in
which
he
had
a
proprietary
interest
when
he
himself
was
not
present
because
in
the
very
brief
filed
by
the
government
at
page
21,
the
government
says,
"in
our
memorandum
filed
last
term,
we
assumed
that
a
criminal
defendant
would
have
standing
to
challenge
unconstitutional
electronic
surveillance
if
one,
he
was
a
participant
in
conversations
overheard
in
this
manner
or
two,
although
not
a
participant,
the
overhearing
occurred
in
premises
owned
by
him
or
in
which
he
had
some
other
interest
at
the
time,
we
add
here
to
this
position."
now
if
the
court
please,
what
is
the
government
saying
here?
it
says,
we
have
the
logs,
memoranda
and
records
resulting
from
this
illicit
electronic
surveillance.
and
we're
not
going
to
give
them
back
to
the
victim
of
this
electronic
surveillance,
rather,
we
are
proposing
a
procedure
by
which
we
make
a
confession
to
the
trial
judge
of
the
nature,
the
time,
the
place,
and
the
fruits
of
our
transgression
and
let
the
district
court
judge
evaluate
that
confession
and
determine
in
camera
ex
parte
what
is
arguably
relevant
to
the
pending
prosecution
and
what
is
the
reason
for
which
they
advance
this
procedure?
they
say
in
the
case
at
bar
because
these
logs,
memoranda,
and
records
may
contain
errant
gossip
without
claim
of
the
truth
and
injurious
to
third
persons.
so,
we
say
then
to
the
government
as
the
logical
next
question.
well,
what
about
those
logs,
records
and
memoranda
that
are
obviously
and
patently
and
palpably
not
injurious
to
third
persons.
and
what
does
the
government
say
to
that?
with
what
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
a
rather
cavalier
and
bizarre
disregard
for
consistency.
they
say,
"the
practical
problem
is
that
neither
the
government
nor
the
court
can
ever
now
with
certainty
when
disclosure
to
the
defendant
of
an
overheard
conversation
might
be
harmful
to
other
participants
in
the
conversation."
i
say
mutatis
mutandis
that
how
can
the
judge
know
whether
failure
to
disclose
the
logs,
memoranda,
and
records
of
the
overheard
conversation
might
be
harmful
to
the
defendant
in
the
vindication
of
his
constitutional
rights.
they
go
on
to
say
at
page
15,
there
are
situations
where
even
the
disclosure
of
a
conversation
that
is
innocuous
on
its
face
can
prejudice
third
defendants.
i
say
mutatis
mutandis
there
are
situations
where
conversations
which
are
perfectly
innocuous
on
their
face
may
be
lethal
in
suggesting
leads
to
evidence
gathered
by
law
enforcement
agencies
for
presentation
to
the
grand
jury
and
for
subsequent
presentation
to
the
trial
court.
they
say
at
page
15,
the
experience
of
the
department
of
justice
in
reviewing
cases
involving
electronic
surveillance
to
determine
when
disclosure
must
be
made
has
indicated
that
because
the
factual
situations
are
so
varied,
it
is
almost
impossible
to
draw
general
rule
of
disclosure
that
can
be
applied
to
a
broad
class
of
cases
and
will
avoid
the
possibility
of
injury
to
third
persons.
to
that
we
say
amen
and
we
say
that
it's
impossible
to
draw
a
rule
of
demarcation
that
will
avoid
through
an
in
camera
ex
parte
proceeding
that
will
avoid
injury
to
the
defendant
in
the
vindication
of
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
only
safe
course
says
the
government
at
page
15,
"we
submit
is
to
decline
the
order
disclosure
whatever
it
is
clear
that
nothing
in
the
materials
submitted
is
arguably
relevant
to
the
prosecution."
we
say
if
the
court
please
that
the
only
safe
course
when
we
are
talking
about
the
vindication
of
constitutional
rights
and
when
concededly
the
trial
judge
cannot
make
this
determination
in
camera
ex
parte
without
the
aid
of
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
is
to
make
these
conversations
which
had
been
illegally
seized
available
to
the
defendant
and
his
counsel.
we
say
if
the
court
please
that
the
constitution,
the
law
and
the
basic
rules
of
fair
play
require
the
disclosure
of
these
materials
to
the
victim
of
the
search.
if
the
court
please
as
was
pointed
out
earlier
this
morning,
it
couldn't
reasonably
be
argued
by
the
government
if
there
had
been
a
search
of
the
defendant's
premises,
a
ransacking
of
his
premises
and
a
seizure
of
his
papers
and
records,
and
letters.
it
couldn't
reasonably
be
argued
by
the
government
that
those
materials
which
were
seized
from
him
shouldn't
be
returned
to
him
but
rather
should
be
handed
up
to
a
district
court
judge
to
determine
whether
any
of
them
had
arguable
relevancy
to
the
pending
prosecution.
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
same
basic
principle
applies
with
respect
to
conversations
which
are
protected
within
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
right.
let
me
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
may
i
address
myself
to
the
question
which
i
understand
your
honor
has
raised.
to
concretize
it,
the
case
where
the
defendant
whose
premises
are
electronically
monitored,
and
the
monitoring
picks
up
conversations
of
a
and
b
when
the
defendant
is
not
present
and
the
question
as
i
understand
posed
by
your
honor
is,
what's
the
defendant's
standing
to
get
those
conversations
and
i
suggest
that
there
are
competing
social
interests
and
there
are
competing
legal
interests.
what
are
they?
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
a
defendant
who
has
been
charged
with
a
criminal
offense
who
is
seeking
to
vindicate
a
constitutional
right.
we
have
here
a
situation
where
the
government
has
violated
his
fourth
amendment
rights
concededly
by
electronically
invading
premises
in
which
he
has
a
proprietary
interest.
as
a
result
of
that
electronic
invasion,
they
have
ripped
certain
benefits,
they
have
ripped
certain
fruits,
they
have
gathered
certain
evidence
which
they
proposed
to
offer
against
him
because
they
are
saying
you
have
no
standing,
and
it
was
not
your
conversation
sir.
on
the
other
hand,
you'll
have
the
competing
social
value
of
the
two
persons
who
thought
they
were
talking
privately
maybe
even
against
the
defendant
himself.
now,
what
is
their
right?
we
are
weighing
a
common
law
right
to
privacy
of
these
people
against
a
constitutional
right
of
the
defendant.
what
can
be
involved
in
that
common
law
right
to
privacy?
it
may
be
a
pecuniary
interest,
well
if
it's
a
pecuniary
interest,
i'm
sure
the
court
will
agree
that
it
should
be
subordinated
to
the
defendant's
constitutional
right
and
the
right
to
privacy
can
be
safe
guarded
effectively
i
suggest
to
the
court
insofar
as
protective
orders
can
be
fashioned
and
tailored
by
the
trial
judge
to
protect
those
third
persons
from
unnecessary
disclosure.
and
it's
been
our
experience,
if
the
court
please,
that
in
everyone
of
the
hearings
which
have
been
conducted
as
a
result
of
an
illicit
electronic
surveillance,
the
defendant
himself
has
asked
for
protective
orders
because
he
does
not
want
to
proliferate
the
damage
resulting
from
the
government's
invasion
of
his
privacy
and
so
to
can
protective
orders
be
fashioned
to
protect
insofar
as
possible
the
right
to
privacy
from
further
damage
as
far
as
third
persons
are
concerned.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
let's
make
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
but
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
pinpointed
the
situation
that
may
constitute
one-tenth
of
100%
of
the
cases
and
i
think
that
even
in
that
situation
that
the
rights
of
the
participants
in
the
conversation
can
be
effectively
safeguarded.
if
in
fact,
we
have
a
realization
of
the
bizarre
hypothesis
that
two
people
on
the
premises
are
talking
about
eliminating
the
proprietor.
then
and
in
that
case,
the
government
i
suggest
to
the
court
has
the
choice
of
providing
those
persons
with
the
same
kind
of
protection
that
it
provides
to
material
witnesses
in
many
cases
where
these
interests
are
at
stake
or
alternatively,
if
it
does
not
wish
to
do
that
and
wants
to
exalt
their
rights
over
and
above
the
interest
of
the
sovereignty
to
go
forth
with
the
prosecution.
they
can
dismiss
the
prosecution
but
i
do
suggest
your
honor,
that
it
is
not
practical,
it
is
not
feasible,
it
is
not
possible
for
a
trial
judge
sitting
in
camera
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
any
of
the
logs,
memoranda,
or
materials
resulting
from
the
electronic
surveillance
where
used
by
the
government
in
developing
leads.
i
want
to
give
the
court
just
one
illustration
of
that
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
we
have
a
case
where
there
is
a
boilerplate
indictment
for
income
tax
evasion
charging
the
defendant
in
the
typical
language
with
evading
taxes
for
a
given
year.
the
only
thing
they
ever
change
in
those
indictments
of
the
year
and
the
amounts
of
money.
now,
unlike
jenks
act
materials
if
the
court
please,
unlike
grand
jury
testimony,
if
the
court
please,
when
we
talk
about
a
trial
judge
looking
at
the
large
memoranda
and
records
of
an
electronic
surveillance,
we're
talking
about
packing
cases
filled
with
materials,
not
sheets
of
paper
and
we're
asking
a
trial
judge
to
build
a
superhuman
task
of
judge
deposing
packing
cases
of
electronically
monitored
conversations
against
the
skill
of
(inaudible)
of
a
criminal
indictment
using
the
wildest
lights
of
his
imaginative
powers
as
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
to
determine
whether
the
government
seize
on
any
of
those
conversations
and
developed
a
lead.
here's
the
case
where
the
trial
judge
spent
four
weeks
reading
the
documents.
they
were
so
voluminous
that
he
had
to
delegate
the
reading
to
another
judge
who
helped
him
and
together
they
took
four
weeks
reading
them
and
they
came
up
with
the
answer
which
you
would
expect
that
there
was
nothing
that
they
could
find
relevant.
but
when
the
trial
of
the
case
came
on,
this
conversation
which
i
submit
no
one
could've
determined
was
arguably
relevant
to
the
indictment
turned
out
to
be
the
origin
of
a
lethal
chain
of
proof.
what
is
the
conversation?
"how
are
you?"
it's
one
end
of
a
phone
conversation.
"you're
coming
on
twa?"
"yes."
"i'll
put
you
into
the
sands.
i'll
get
a
hold
of
cliff,
i'll
call
right
now.
charlie
won't
be
there,
his
wife
is
being
operated
on.
i'll
have
a
room
there
for
you
and
your
wife.
you're
going
to
stay
through
sandy.
okay
buddy."
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
no
trial
judge
sitting
before
trial
or
after
he
had
heard
all
of
the
proof
in
a
three-week
trial
could
have
determined
in
camera
ex
parte
that
that
was
as
it
turned
out
to
be
the
origin
of
a
line
of
proof
that
was
devastating.
now,
what
is
more
if
the
court
please?
when
this
court
and
other
courts
fashion
rules
designed
to
deter
lawless
law
enforcement,
we
find
that
more
sophisticated
methods
or
device
to
countervail
the
rules
of
disclosure.
for
example,
when
the
jenks
decision
came
down
and
when
the
jenks
statute
was
subsequently
enacted
by
the
congress,
we
found
well
motivated
law
enforcement
officers
zealous
in
the
pursuit
of
their
duties
who
found
ways
to
put
on
paper
in
narrative
form
statements
that
were
not
susceptible
to
turnover
under
jenks.
when
the
dennis
case
came
down,
and
grand
jury
testimony
was
ordered
to
be
turned
over
to
the
defense
after
the
direct
testimony,
we
found
and
our
finding
across
the
country
well-meaning
and
zealous,
able,
competent
prosecutors
who
seek
to
avoid
this
procedure
with
advantage
to
the
defendant
by
having
grand
jury
minutes
no
longer
transcribed.
now,
in
this
instance,
when
we
have
a
kolod
rule,
what
has
happen?
what
can
happen?
it
isn't
any
longer
necessary,
if
the
court
please,
to
make
logs,
memoranda,
or
records
of
electronically
monitored
conversations.
we
cite
in
our
brief
a
situation
where
the
age
in
charge
of
the
investigation
monitored
the
premises
of
the
suspect
24
hours
a
day.
he
listens
to
the
conversations
each
day
and
if
he
saw
anything
in
those
conversations
which
he
believed
to
be
of
interest
to
him,
he
would
telephone
to
another
field
office.
the
information
gleamed
and
he
would
ask
field
operatives
to
rundown
those
leads
and
the
basis
of
the
lead
would
be
ascribed
to
a
confidential
informant
protected
from
disclosure
by
mccray
against
illinois
and
a
lead
would
be
developed.
a
file
would
be
created
and
there
would
be
nothing,
nothing
of
a
written
nature
to
turnover
to
the
trial
judge
for
an
in
camera
ex
parte
examination
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
fruitful
violation
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
so,
i
suggest
to
court
that
it
is
not
possible
for
a
defendant
to
vindicate
his
constitutional
rights
in
the
area
of
electronic
surveillance
without
an
adversary
hearing
of
full
open
adversary
hearing
and
without
a
disclosure
to
him
of
the
nature
of
the
surveillance,
the
time
of
the
surveillance,
the
place
of
the
surveillance
and
the
fruits
of
the
surveillance.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
i
think
i
could
explain
myself
on
that
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
understand
you
take
questions.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
like
to
answer
both
the
questions
suppose.
i
don't
think
the
telephone
company
had
any
right
because
at
least
that
phone
booth
for
the
purpose
to
phone
the
katz.
he
was
the
one
whose
proprietary
interest
was
invaded.
but
on
the
first
question
that
you
ask,
your
honor
says
that
i
say
that
c's
constitutional
rights
were
invaded
but
with
respect
to
a
and
b,
there's
only
a
common
law
right
to
privacy.
i
do
say
that.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
a
and
b's
constitutional
rights
have
already
been
invaded
by
the
government
just
as
c's
but
when
we
come
to
the
question
posed
by
the
government
as
to
whether
a
and
b's
conversations
which
have
already
been
victimize
by
an
unconstitutional
search
should
be
made
available
to
c,
the
defendant,
then
and
in
that
case
as
between
a,
b,
c.
we're
not
talking
about
constitutional
rights,
we
are
then
talking
about
a
right
to
privacy
which
they
have
against
him
with
respect
to
conversations
which
have
already
been
seized
unconstitutionally
and
i
say
that
their
right
to
privacy
as
again
c
must
be
subordinated
to
his
constitutional
right
to
vindicate
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
good
at
--
here
to
denigrate
the
fact
that
a
and
b's
constitutional
rights
had
been
invaded
but
that's
accomplished
fact.
fortunately
for
them,
they're
not
defendants.
c
is
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
right.
the
only
--
the
difference
is
that
this
is
the
post
indictment
staged
in
c.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
right.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
right.
the
difference
in
the
cases
your
honor
is
that
c
is
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
who
has
a
right
not
to
be
convicted
by
illegally
obtained
evidence.
in
the
case
that
you
hypothesized
a
and
c
are
not
the
defendants
and
in
this
frame
of
reference,
i
say
that
in
the
hierarchy
values
that
the
court
should
place
a
and
b's
right
subordinate
to
c's.
if
a
and
b
were
indicted
and
they
were
seeking
the
vindication
of
their
constitutional
rights
and
another
frame
of
reference,
i
would
have
a
different
answer
for
you.
but
i
stand
by
what
i
said
earlier
mr.
justice
stewart
that
having
taken
as
the
fact,
the
young
constitutional
invasion
of
the
rights
of
all
three
that
as
between
a,
b,
and
c,
we
are
really
talking
about
a
common
law
right
to
privacy,
a,
b,
against
c
and
that
can
be
safeguarded
insofar
as
it's
practical
for
the
vindication
of
c's
right
by
a
protective
order
that
inhibits
both
c
and
his
counsel
from
making
unnecessary
disclosure
of
the
contents
of
that
conversation.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
in
a
word
your
honor,
the
government
illegally
and
unconstitutionally
listened
to
conversations
which
they
believe
where
being
privately
held
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
katz,
silverman,
wong
sun
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
by
c's
consent,
no
sir,
not
by
c's
consent.
it
was
a
subject
to
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
if
i
understand
your
question,
are
you
asking
whether
c
could
give
consent
to
the
government
to
electronically
monitor
a
and
b's
conversation
if
it
was
reasonably
foreseeable
to
them
that
their
privacy
was
not
being
invaded,
i
would
say
not
sir.
because
i
think
that
consent,
if
it
is
to
be
an
effective
way
or
it
must
be
limited
to
one
of
the
participants
in
the
conversation
where
the
parties
to
the
conversation
can
unreasonably
foresee
that
they're
going
to
be
overheard
in
the
normal
course
of
things.
now,
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
standing
that
has
been
raised
here,
it
is
our
contention
and
i
have,
i
think
articulated
that
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
that
alderisio
has
standing
with
respect
to
conversations
heard
on
his
premises
not
withstanding
the
fact
hat
he
was
not
present,
i
read
page
21
of
the
solicitor's
brief
as
a
concession
of
that
position
and
i
think
a
concession
is
necessary
for
the
simple
reason
that
if
we
are
to
make
the
fruits
of
an
unconstitutional
invasion
for
one's
premises
inadmissible,
it
follows
clearly
that
we
must
make
the
conversation
seized
on
alderisio's
premises
inadmissible
against
him.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
to
answer
your
question,
as
sharply
as
it
was
posed
your
honor,
yes,
i
would
take
that
position
and
i
underscore,
that
section
of
your
question
which
said
in
which
he
had
no
interest
in.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
well,
as
we
develop
the
question
of
standing
through
the
warning
here
your
honor,
it
is
ultimately
our
position
that
a
person
aggrieved
within
the
purview
of
an
electronic
surveillance
in
rule
41
is
one
against
whom
the
search
is
directed
whether
he
is
identified
or
unidentified
at
the
time
of
the
search.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
right
your
honor,
subject
to
one
qualification
which
i'm
going
to
develop
and
i
give,
i
think
that
a
co-defendant
stands
in
the
shoes
of
his
co-defendant
with
respect
to
his
right.
a
co-conspirator
stands
in
the
shoes
of
his
co-conspirator
with
respect
to
this
right.
so,
in
the
case
for
example
of
alderman
against
whom
the
government
says
it
conducted
no
surveillance
and
whose
premises
it
says
it
did
not
invade,
we
nonetheless
say
if
the
court
please
that
since
this
was
an
indictment
sounding
in
conspiracy
and
since
the
government
took
the
procedure
advantages
that
flow
from
a
conspiracy
case
namely
the
imputation
of
the
acts
and
declarations
of
alderisio
to
alderman
and
alderman
to
alderisio
and
the
unindicted
conspirators
to
each.
since
it
takes
the
partnership
theory
and
lays
all
the
duties
of
a
partnership
on
each
of
the
co-conspirators,
we
say
that
when
you
take
that
theory
to
the
limits
of
its
logic,
you
have
to
give
them
the
rights
of
partners
also.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
would
accept
what
your
honor
just
said
with
the
elimination
of
the
advert.
i
think
--
mr.
edward
benett
williams
i
think
and
i
say
that
if
the
time
has
come
that
concept
of
standing
must
be
expanded
your
honor
if
we
are
going
to
fashion
a
rule
that
will
deter
electronic
surveillance
because
i
suggest
that
the
rule
for
which
the
government
contends
is
now
our
case.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
if
he
has
--
if
neither
his
conversation
is
heard.
if
his
premises
are
not
invaded,
if
he
is
not
the
subject
matter
of
the
conversation
and
if
he
is
not
a
co-defendant
with
one
whose
conversation
or
premises
were
invaded,
then
i
say
he
does
not
have
standing.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
benett
williams
that's
another
ingredient
and
i
think
that
is
the
ingredient
on
which
we
part
company
with
the
government
in
this
proceeding
as
i
understand
their
briefs.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
this
case
and
the
next
case
said
is
ivanov
and
i
hope
to
develop
the
question
of
standing
fully
in
that
companion
case
to
this.
so
i
will
defer
with
the
court's
indulgence
my
discussion
of
standing
until
that
case
is
called.
