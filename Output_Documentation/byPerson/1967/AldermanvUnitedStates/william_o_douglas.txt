o.

you
mean
by
that
mr.
solicitor
that
if
we
would've
come
out
contrary
to
your
position
as
in
camera
inspections
in
the
alderman
case;
you
would
still
urge
that
there
are
other
reasons
why
we
ought
to
require
in
camera
inspection.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
suppose
we
came
out
contrary
to
your
position
in
alderman,
how
would
you
suggest
that
the
issue
of
national
security
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
a
trial
judge
in
a
case
like
this
and
really
by
and
for
representation
of
the
u.s.
attorney
or
an
assistant
u.s.
attorney?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
would
be
enough?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
think
that
you
have
procedures
in
the
justice
department
where
the
representations,
aren't
there
in
privilege
cases
made
by
someone
very
much
higher
up
than
the
u.s.
attorney?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
know,
i
can
see,
my
premise
is
that
you're
not
ordinarily
to
be
entitled
in
camera
inspection
but
that
you're
arguing
that
it
should
in
any
event
be
an
exception
for
national
security
cases
but
i'm
just
concerned
how
practically
the
fact
that
it's
a
national
security
case
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge?
do
you
think
it's
enough
just
to
have
an
assistant
u.s.
attorney
representative?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
this
is
one
on
therefore,
we
want
you
to
go
ahead
and
make
an
in
camera
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
mr.
danzig,
do
you
understand
that
the
government
raises
any
standing
question
in
either
the
ivanov
or
that
is
asking
that
any
standing
question
be
litigated
on
remand?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
yes.
no,
you're
quite
correct
and
i
was
just
wondering
whether
you
understood
the
government
was
raising
it
even
though
we
ask
it
to
be
argued.
