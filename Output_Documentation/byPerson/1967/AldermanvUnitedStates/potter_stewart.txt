justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
reported
case
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
helpful
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
williams,
presumably,
they
also
seized
illegally
and
criminally
and
all
those
other
adverbs
you
used,
the
private
conversations
of
other
people
too
and
it
certainly
wouldn't
advanced
the
right
of
those
people
to
have
those
conversations
turned
over
to
you,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
constitutional
rights
too
under
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
your
position
is
that
x
is
entitled
to
those
tapes
of
mr.
y's
conversation
with
mr.
z
just
as
a
matter
of
a
property
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
property
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
he
is
the
lessor.
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
the
lessor.
justice
potter
stewart
the
conversation
is
between
--
lessee?
justice
potter
stewart
the
conversation
is
between
y
and
z
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
point
was
that
the
conversation
between
y
and
z
is
the
property
of
x,
he
is
entitled
to
his
property
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
what
you
mean
jones
would
not
have
any
right
to
insist
that
the
government
turned
over
to
him
information
whether
or
not
it
in
fact
had
obtained
this
information
that
way.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know,
but
does
this
mean
that
in
every
case
the
defense
lawyer
is
coming
--
going
to
stand
up?
we
don't
know
where
the
government
got
its
evidence
but
it
maybe
it
got
it
through
some
lead
from
illicit
electronic
surveillance.
we
want
the
government
to
tell
us
whether
or
not
it
did,
is
that
what
--
is
that
what
would
happen?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
in
that
instance
mr.
williams.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
government
had
initially
come
up
with
the
information.
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
asking
you
is
in
the
jones
case
is
jones'
lawyer
have
--
does
he
initiate
some
proceeding
either
before
trial
which
he
insist
that
the
government
say
whether
or
not
any
of
this
information
came
on
such
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
it
voluntarily?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
take
it
and
there
must
be
remand
in
this
case
obviously.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
already
ordered
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
gather
this
is
going
to
be
an
issue
on
the
fact,
isn't
it?
i
assume
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
i
--
but
does
the
government
think
that
depending
on
how
that
issue
affect
is
resolve,
there
may
be
different
standing
rules?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
is
there
a
difference
mr.
solicitor
general
in
as
to
why
this
is
relevant,
the
terms
on
whether
or
not
this
was
or
was
not
alderisio's
premises?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
because
the
government
i
gather
would
in
any
event
allow
them
only
the
tapes
of
conversations
to
which
he
was
a
party
or
of
conversations
in
his
presence
even
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
irrespective
of
whether
it
was
on
his
--
at
his
home
or
somewhere
else
or
i
guess
his
business
premises
and
so.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
business
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
may
--
and
he
may
be
entitled
to
more
of
the
tapes.
in
other
words,
he
may
be
entitled
to
something
more
than
just
the
tapes
of
conversations
to
which
he
was
supporting.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you'd
taken
the
position
that
anything
determined
by
the
trial
judge
in
camera
to
fall
into
that
category
must
be
turned
over.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
assume
that
a
invites
b
and
c
to
a
meeting
in
his
house
and
a
has
the
consents
--
make
--
asks
the
government
to
consents
to
the
taping
of
that
conversation
by
the
government.
now,
is
the
government's
position
that
b
and
c
--
that
there's
been
any
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
that?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
a
has
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
really
a
relationship
to
the
parents,
is
it?
how
about
let's
say
that
a
has
a
hotel
room
and
he's
absent
and
b
and
c
are
in
that
room
they
have
no
relationship
with
the
premises
at
all
but
they
do
have
an
ordinary
and
they
have
an
expectation
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
the
--
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
potter
stewart
but
wouldn't
you
--
certainly
this
case
wouldn't
even
be
here
if
there
was
not
a
violation
of
a
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
--
you
better
remain
free
to
argue
to
the
district
judge
that
there
was
no
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
you
wanted
to
know
for
another
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
get
it,
if
you
could
established
at
the
hearing
as
a
fact
but
you
say
in
your
footnote
that
the
places
where
the
conversations
were
overheard
were
not
his
place
of
business
but
business
establishments
owned
by
associates
or
his
firms
and
alderisio
himself
did
not
have
office
space
in
subject
premises
and
this
is
pretty
much
the
same
situation
as
if
in
fact
the
overheard
conversation
have
taken
place
in
the
street
corner?
justice
potter
stewart
be
like
in
a
telephone
booth?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
make
this
argument
mr.
williams
whether
or
not
the
place
where
they
were
overheard
were
his
premises?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
has
any
bearing
on
how
--
the
scope
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
assuming
that
the
government
was
able
to
establish
they
had
no
proprietary
interest
in
the
premises.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
question
is
standing
that
has
become
very
important.
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
the
scope
of
what
he
is
entitled
to,
depending
on
whether
he
had
interest
or
not
in
the
premises,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
williams,
i'm
still
troubled
a
little
bit
or
more
than
a
little
bit
by
what
seemed
to
concern
justice
fortas
in
his
question
to
you
given
the
case
of
a
conversation
between
a
and
b
on
the
premises
of
c
and
c
is
the
defendant
in
the
subsequent
criminal
prosecution.
you
suggested
in
your
answer
that
c
is
right
was
a
fourth
amendment
right,
a
constitutional
right,
whereas
the
right
of
a
and
b
was
something
less
that
if
it
was
i
think
you
characterize
it
as
a
common
law
right
of
privacy.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
explain
what's
on
my
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
take
the
katz
case
for
example
now,
that
telephone
booth
i
assume
was
the
property
of
the
telephone
company
and
so
we
had
this
fourth
amendment
right
i
supposed
as
if
going
on
the
premises,
under
your
theory
was
violated.
mr.
katz,
however,
this
court
held
right
there
only
also
had
a,
not
a
common
law
right
but
a
fourth
amendment
right
on
those
premises.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
accomplished
fact
with
respect
to
c.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
talking
about
sanctions
and
protections.
justice
potter
stewart
to
try
to
repair
the
violation
of
the
--
the
two
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
position.
and
just
in
a
word
what
is
the
violation
of
a
and
b's
constitutional
rights
if
their
on
c's
premises.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
said
in
silverman,
katz
sort
of
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
subject
to
this
--
in
your
view,
is
that
subject
to
adhesions
by
c's
consent?
justice
potter
stewart
if
c
suggest
the
government,
if
you
a
and
b
are
going
to
have
a
conversation
in
my
premises,
apprehended
lease
even
though
a
and
b
anticipates
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
just
let
me
ask
you
mr.
danzig.
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
your
position
does
go
beyond,
the
one
stated
by
mr.
williams
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
go
all
the
way
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
just
simply
stated
it
is
that
logically.
justice
potter
stewart
the
exclusionary
rule
is
designed
to
deter
illegal
action
by
government
enforcement
authority?
justice
potter
stewart
then,
no
matter
how
they
get
it
no
matter
who
was
hurt,
they
should
never
be
able
to
use
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
true
that
the
only
reason
we
know
that
there
was
electronic
surveillance
in
this
case
is
because
of
the
voluntary
disclosure
of
that
fact
by
the
government
after
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
done
in
conformity
with
what
has
been
described
as
current
government
policy,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
--
it
occurred
to
my
mind
is
that,
what
if
the
policy
should
change?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
do
you
think
you
--
do
you
think
the
defendant
in
every
case
has
a
right
to
file
a
motion
or
interrogatory
or
something
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
that
line
to
ask
the
government
whether
there
was
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
something
that
doesn't
take
place
in
the
united
states
isn't
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
electronic
surveillance
in
england
for
instance
in
disclosing
espionage
in
the
united
states.
there's
no
problem
with
the
fourth
amendment
because
england
doesn't
have
a
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
what
other
view,
you
mean
that
something
happens
in
iran
and
france
or
italy?
justice
potter
stewart
the
hand
is
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
--
just
going
to
happen
if
i
would
think
to
get
to
the
standing
question
first
if
there
is
standing;
there
wouldn't
be
any
disclosure
of
the
judge
or
anybody
else.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would,
i
would
think
and
i
would
suppose
you
would
say
that
unless
a
has
standing
to
object
that
he
--
that
you
wouldn't
if
he's
the
defendant,
you
wouldn't
unless
he
has
standing
you
wouldn't
have
to
turnover
the
judge,
any
of
the
tapes
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
reported
case
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
helpful
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
williams,
presumably,
they
also
seized
illegally
and
criminally
and
all
those
other
adverbs
you
used,
the
private
conversations
of
other
people
too
and
it
certainly
wouldn't
advanced
the
right
of
those
people
to
have
those
conversations
turned
over
to
you,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
constitutional
rights
too
under
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
your
position
is
that
x
is
entitled
to
those
tapes
of
mr.
y's
conversation
with
mr.
z
just
as
a
matter
of
a
property
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
property
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
he
is
the
lessor.
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
the
lessor.
justice
potter
stewart
the
conversation
is
between
--
lessee?
justice
potter
stewart
the
conversation
is
between
y
and
z
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
point
was
that
the
conversation
between
y
and
z
is
the
property
of
x,
he
is
entitled
to
his
property
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
what
you
mean
jones
would
not
have
any
right
to
insist
that
the
government
turned
over
to
him
information
whether
or
not
it
in
fact
had
obtained
this
information
that
way.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know,
but
does
this
mean
that
in
every
case
the
defense
lawyer
is
coming
--
going
to
stand
up?
we
don't
know
where
the
government
got
its
evidence
but
it
maybe
it
got
it
through
some
lead
from
illicit
electronic
surveillance.
we
want
the
government
to
tell
us
whether
or
not
it
did,
is
that
what
--
is
that
what
would
happen?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
in
that
instance
mr.
williams.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
government
had
initially
come
up
with
the
information.
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
asking
you
is
in
the
jones
case
is
jones'
lawyer
have
--
does
he
initiate
some
proceeding
either
before
trial
which
he
insist
that
the
government
say
whether
or
not
any
of
this
information
came
on
such
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
it
voluntarily?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
take
it
and
there
must
be
remand
in
this
case
obviously.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
already
ordered
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
gather
this
is
going
to
be
an
issue
on
the
fact,
isn't
it?
i
assume
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
i
--
but
does
the
government
think
that
depending
on
how
that
issue
affect
is
resolve,
there
may
be
different
standing
rules?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
is
there
a
difference
mr.
solicitor
general
in
as
to
why
this
is
relevant,
the
terms
on
whether
or
not
this
was
or
was
not
alderisio's
premises?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
because
the
government
i
gather
would
in
any
event
allow
them
only
the
tapes
of
conversations
to
which
he
was
a
party
or
of
conversations
in
his
presence
even
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
irrespective
of
whether
it
was
on
his
--
at
his
home
or
somewhere
else
or
i
guess
his
business
premises
and
so.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
business
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
may
--
and
he
may
be
entitled
to
more
of
the
tapes.
in
other
words,
he
may
be
entitled
to
something
more
than
just
the
tapes
of
conversations
to
which
he
was
supporting.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you'd
taken
the
position
that
anything
determined
by
the

to
fall
into
that
category
must
be
turned
over.
justice

stewart
mr.

assume
that
a
invites
b
and
c
to
a
meeting
in
his
house
and
a
has
the
consents
--
make
--
asks
the
government
to
consents
to
the
taping
of
that
conversation
by
the
government.
now,
is
the
government's
position
that
b
and
c
--
that
there's
been
any
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
that?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
a
has
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
really
a
relationship
to
the
parents,
is
it?
how
about
let's
say
that
a
has
a
hotel
room
and
he's
absent
and
b
and
c
are
in
that
room
they
have
no

at

but
they
do
have

ordinary
and
they
have
an
expectation
that
--
justice

stewart
i
don't
see
the
--
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice

but
wouldn't
you
--
certainly
this
case
wouldn't
even
be
here
if
there
was
not
a
violation
of
a
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
--
you
better
remain
free
to
argue
to
the
district
judge
that
there
was
no
violation?
justice

stewart
you
wanted
to
know
for
another
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
get
it,
if
you
could
established
at

but
you

in

that

did
not

and
this
is
pretty
much
the
same
situation
as
if
in
fact
the
overheard
conversation
have
taken
place
in
the
street
corner?
justice

be

in

justice

did
he
make
this
argument
mr.
williams
whether
or
not
the
place
where
they
were

were
his

justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
has
any
bearing
on
how
--
the
scope
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
assuming
that
the
government
was
able
to
establish
they
had
no
proprietary
interest
in
the
premises.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
question
is
standing
that
has
become
very
important.
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
the
scope
of
what
he
is
entitled
to,
depending
on
whether
he
had
interest
or
not
in
the
premises,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
williams,
i'm
still
troubled
a
little
bit
or
more
than
a
little
bit
by
what
seemed
to
concern
justice
fortas
in
his
question
to
you
given
the
case
of
a
conversation
between
a
and
b
on
the
premises
of
c
and
c
is
the
defendant
in
the
subsequent
criminal
prosecution.
you
suggested
in
your
answer
that
c
is
right
was
a
fourth
amendment
right,
a
constitutional
right,
whereas
the
right
of
a
and
b
was
something
less
that
if
it
was
i
think
you
characterize
it
as
a
common
law
right
of
privacy.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
explain
what's
on
my
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
take
the
katz
case
for
example
now,
that
telephone
booth
i
assume
was
the
property
of
the
telephone
company
and
so
we
had
this
fourth
amendment
right
i
supposed
as
if
going
on
the
premises,
under
your
theory
was
violated.
mr.
katz,
however,
this
court
held
right
there
only
also
had
a,
not
a
common
law
right
but
a
fourth
amendment
right
on
those
premises.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
accomplished
fact
with
respect
to
c.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
talking
about
sanctions
and
protections.
justice
potter
stewart
to
try
to
repair
the
violation
of
the
--
the
two
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
position.
and
just
in
a
word
what
is
the
violation
of
a
and
b's
constitutional
rights
if
their
on
c's
premises.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
said
in
silverman,
katz
sort
of
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
subject
to
this
--
in
your
view,
is
that
subject
to
adhesions
by
c's
consent?
justice
potter
stewart
if
c
suggest
the
government,
if
you
a
and
b
are
going
to
have
a
conversation
in
my
premises,
apprehended
lease
even
though
a
and
b
anticipates
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
just
let
me
ask
you
mr.
danzig.
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
your
position
does
go
beyond,
the
one
stated
by
mr.
williams
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
go
all
the
way
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
just
simply
stated
it
is
that
logically.
justice
potter
stewart
the
exclusionary
rule
is
designed
to
deter
illegal
action
by
government
enforcement
authority?
justice
potter
stewart
then,
no
matter
how
they
get
it
no
matter
who
was
hurt,
they
should
never
be
able
to
use
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
true
that
the
only
reason
we
know
that
there
was
electronic
surveillance
in
this
case
is
because
of
the
voluntary
disclosure
of
that
fact
by
the
government
after
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
done
in
conformity
with
what
has
been
described
as
current
government
policy,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
--
it
occurred
to
my
mind
is
that,
what
if
the
policy
should
change?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
do
you
think
you
--
do
you
think
the
defendant
in
every
case
has
a
right
to
file
a
motion
or
interrogatory
or
something
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
that
line
to
ask
the
government
whether
there
was
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
something
that
doesn't
take
place
in
the
united
states
isn't
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
electronic
surveillance
in
england
for
instance
in
disclosing
espionage
in
the
united
states.
there's
no
problem
with
the
fourth
amendment
because
england
doesn't
have
a
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
what
other
view,
you
mean
that
something
happens
in
iran
and
france
or
italy?
justice
potter
stewart
the
hand
is
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
--
just
going
to
happen
if
i
would
think
to
get
to
the
standing
question
first
if
there
is
standing;
there
wouldn't
be
any
disclosure
of
the
judge
or
anybody
else.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would,
i
would
think
and
i
would
suppose
you
would
say
that
unless
a
has
standing
to
object
that
he
--
that
you
wouldn't
if
he's
the
defendant,
you
wouldn't
unless
he
has
standing
you
wouldn't
have
to
turnover
the
judge,
any
of
the
tapes
to
--
