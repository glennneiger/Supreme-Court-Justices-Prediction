justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
williams,
i
take
it
that
x
wouldn't
have
known
what
y
and
z
said
between
themselves
except
for
the
government's
bugging.
i
don't
suppose
he
could
have
ever
found
out
what
y
and
z
said
while
he
wasn't
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
is
that
if
the
government
violated
his
rights,
what
y
and
z
said
between
them
might
have
certainly
approved
some
very
valuable
lead
to
the
government
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
proving
their
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
can't
ever
tell
that
until
you
look
at
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
in
your
example
with
the
lady
friend,
i
suppose
that
you
are
saying
that
you're
not
only
should
know
whose
conversations
were
picked
up
but
actually
what
the
content
was
even
though,
i
don't
suppose
even
diligent
counsel
would
suggest
that
perhaps
you
can
unearth
any
helpful,
anything
out
of
the
content
of
what
was
said
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
mean
that
you
would
--
that
the
two
people
say
to
each
other,
well,
are
you
going
to
the
movies?
and
i
--
they
say
--
the
other
one
says,
yes.
well,
now
perhaps,
what
was
said
wouldn't
be
very
relevant
and
i
suppose
it
might
be
very
critical
to
know
that
those
people
were
actually
talking
on
the
defendant's
premises.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
but
so
--
i
gather
that
wouldn't
satisfy
you
if
they
just
disclosed
to
whose
conversations
were
picked
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
although,
you
would
consider
must
be
some
conversations,
the
content
of
some
conversations
that
would
be
pretty
hard
to
imagine
that
they
were
relevant
to
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there's
no
standing
the
tapes
never
get
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
there's
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
i'm
still
confused.
if
this
is
alderisio's
place
of
business,
is
there
is
it
not
the
government's
position
that
all
of
the
tapes
of
all
conversations
must
be
turned
over
to
the
judge
if
it's
alderisio's
place
of
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
now,
if
it
is
not
alderisio's
place
of
business,
then
how
much
of
the
tapes
are
to
be
turned
over
assuming
that
there
are
two
years
of
tapes
of
some
place
not
alderisio's
place
of
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
there
maybe
--
whatever
there
maybe,
you
know
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
mr.
solicitor
general.
i
wish
you'd
help
me
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
to
one
extent
it's
whether
or
not
the
bugging
was
at
his
place
of
business
or
not
at
his
place
of
business
change
the
government's
position
of
what
should
be
turned
over
to
the
judge.
well,
if
it
was
at
his
place
of
business,
i
would
think
that
he
had
a
greater
--
there
was
greater
extending
and
greater
need
to
turn
material
over
to
the
judge
--
consideration
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
i
can
see
everything,
yes.
certainly
if
it
was
what
he
suggests.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
interrupt
there
and
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
maximum
note
that
the
government
really
has
to
suffer
in
any
of
these
cases
is
dismissal
of
the
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
same
--
whether
it's
national
security
case
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
interest
of
the
defendant
is
to
say
and
the
interest
of
the
government
of
prosecuting
is
the
same
or
and
it's
just
that
the
reason
for
not
disclosing
is
the
very
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
in
any
of
these
cases,
that
the
maximum
harm
that
come
to
government's
dismissal
in
the
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
example,
there's
no
issue
comparable
to
the
deterrence
issue
that
we
have
involved
in
this
situation
--
justice
