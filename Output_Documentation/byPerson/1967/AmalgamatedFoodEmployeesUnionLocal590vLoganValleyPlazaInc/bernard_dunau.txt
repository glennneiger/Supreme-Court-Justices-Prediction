mr.
bernard
dunau
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
state
court
injunction
prohibits
as
trespass
on
private
property,
peaceful
picketing
by
union
men
and
women
in
front
of
a
supermarket
located
within
a
shopping
center,
informing
the
public
that
the
store
is
nonunion.
these
employees
are
not
receiving
union
wages
or
other
union
benefits.
we
have
three
questions.
one,
is
this
prohibition
of
peaceful
picketing
within
the
shopping
center
an
abridgment
of
first
amendment
rights?
two,
is
the
conduct
within
the
sole
governance
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
so
that
the
state
court
has
no
power
to
deal
with
it
at
all
and
three,
if
the
state
court
is
empowered
to
deal
with
the
conduct,
does
the
injunction
prohibit
the
federally
protected
right
conferred
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
engage
in
peaceful
picketing.
now
these
questions
arise
in
this
setting.
logan
valley
mall
is
a
shopping
center.
at
the
time
of
the
events
in
this
case,
it
was
newly
opened.
it's
a
pretty
big
shopping
center.
it
expands
a
perimeter
of
about
1.1
miles.
it
is
located
at
the
intersection
of
two
public
highways.
the
highways
are
separated
from
the
shopping
center
by
what
are
called
earthen
berms
which
is
an
earthen
embankment
with
a
ditch.
the
highways
are
separated
from
the
shopping
center
by
earthen
berms,
b
e
r
m
s
embankments,
they're
just
--
it's
just
dirt
road
and
that's
about
all
i
can
see
that
it
means
there's
a
ditch
along
this
berm.
this
is
unbroken
except
for
five
paved
entrances
which
provide
ingress
and
egress
to
the
shopping
center.
the
paved
entrances
are
about
20-feet
in
width,
the
berms
vary
from
12
to
15
feet
in
width.
now,
from
the
entrances
to
the
shopping
center
and
the
weis
supermarket
which
is
the
store
involved
in
this
case,
entrances
one
and
two
are
about
350
feet
distant.
entrance
three
a
little
further
and
entrance
four
and
five
are
about
450
to
500
feet
from
the
highway
entrance
to
the
weis
supermarket.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
what
separates
the
buildings
from
the
highway
are
parking
areas
and
pedestrian
ways.
the
usual
set
up
of
a
shopping
center
of
places
where
you
park
your
cars,
roads
so
that
you
can
maneuver
your
cars
within
the
shopping
center
and
sidewalks
where
shoppers
can
go.
now
when
this
shopping
center
opened
for
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
there's
a
fence
around
it.
when
this
shopping
center
opened
for
business,
the
two
occupants
were
weis
markets
which
is
a
supermarket
selling
food
and
other
household
articles
and
sears,
roebuck
and
company
which
operated
a
department
store
and
which
operates
an
automotive
service
station.
there
are
now
15
additional
tenants.
there's
jc
penney,
the
shopping
center
now
performs
all
of
the
usual
retail
services
associated
with
the
shopping
center.
now,
when
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
it
is.
it's
a
short
distance
from
altona,
it's
something
called
logan
township
which
i
gather
is
a
suburban
area,
yes
your
honor.
when
logan
valley
opened
for
business
on
december
8,
1965,
it
employed
only
nonunion
people.
a
few
days
later
after
it
opened,
it
posted
its
property
with
a
sign
which
said,
no
trespassing
or
soliciting
is
allowed
on
weis
market
porch
or
parking
lot
by
anyone
except
weis
employees
without
the
consent
of
the
management.
on
december
17th,
picketing
began.the
average
numbers
of
pickets
were
five,
six
or
seven.
they
were
men
and
women.
they
were
members
of
the
amalgamated
meat
cutters
union.
they
work
for
other
neighboring
stores
acme,
anp,
quaker
and
they
volunteer
to
picket
on
their
own
time.
and
they
picketed
with
signs
which
said,
the
store
is
nonunion,
the
employees
are
not
receiving
union
wages
or
other
union
benefits.
mr.
bernard
dunau
on
one
night,
there
were
13
pickets
and
the
witness
testifying
as
to
their
conduct
said,
they
walk,
two
have
rest
and
sometimes
three
and
four.
now
with
respect,
perhaps
i
should
say
immediately
at
this
point.
there
is
a
claim
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
this
picketing
was
physical
obstructive.
the
finding
is
to
the
contrary.
the
finding
is
in
both
courts
below
were
emphatic
that
the
picketing
was
entirely
peaceful
in
nature.
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
there
is
no
question
that
the
picketing
which
was
conducted
at
and
in
the
pick
up
zone
which
is
in
front
of
the
sidewalk.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
the
best
way
i
can
reach
that
your
honor
is
to
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
word
peaceful
excludes
the
obstruction.
now,
with
respect
to
that,
however,
i
would
like
to
read
the
specific
finding
of
the
court
below
on
the
subject.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
of
--
we
have
it
on
page
6
of
our
reply
brief.
it's
at
page
89
to
90
of
the
record.
the
court
first
recites
that
small
groups
of
men
and
women
wearing
placards,
weis
markets
is
nonunion,
these
employees
are
not
receiving
union
wages
or
other
union
benefits
work
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
weis
supermarket
more
particularly
in
the
pickup
zone
adjacent
to
the
covered
porch.
occasional
picketing
as
above
described
has
taken
place
on
the
covered
porch
itself
and
this
i
think
is
the
critical
finding
while
such
picketing
has
been
persisted
in
and
may
have,
not
did,
may
have
infrequently
caused
temporary
congestion
near
the
so
--
supermarket
entrances
or
sporadic
stoppage
of
the
flow
of
vehicles
in
the
pickup
zone.
and
while
the
pickets
refused
a
request
by
the
assistant
general
superintendent
for
weis
markets
to
move
off
the
mall
proper,
the
picketing
has
been
peaceful
and
unaccompanied
by
either
oral
threats
or
actual
violence.
now,
even
the
introductory
qualification
does
not
say
that
there
was
an
obstruction
of
the
pickup
zone.it
says
there
may
have
been,
not
that
there
was,
and
if
there
was,
it
was
infrequent,
temporary,
sporadic.
we
do
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
were
primarily
in
the
pickup
zone
which
is
on
the
street
in
front
of
the
sidewalk.
they
were
very
occasionally
on
the
sidewalk
itself.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
put
it
this
way.
mr.
bernard
dunau
there's
a
pretty
good
diagram
of
it
at
page
4
of
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
picketing
at
the
pickup
zone
had
a
possibility
of
interfering
with
the
traffic
flow
in
and
out
of
the
picket
zone
--
pickup
zone,
and
therefore,
i
would
say
that
the
ideal
place
for
those
pickets
to
have
been
would
have
been
on
the
sidewalk
and
not
in
the
pickup
zone,
and
we
would
be
perfectly
content
to
have
them
on
the
sidewalk
and
not
in
the
picket
zone
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
in
reasonable
numbers.
mr.
bernard
dunau
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
primarily
in
the
pickup
zone
and
occasionally
on
the
sidewalk,
but
they
were
in
both
places,
yes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
as
a
matter
of
fact,
however,
the
case
does
not
turn
on
whether
they
were
in
the
pickup
zone
or
on
the
sidewalk
because
what
both
courts
below
found
is
that
they
shouldn't
have
been
any
place
in
the
vicinity
of
the
store.
they
should
have
been
at
the
highway
entrances.
so
is
that
in
terms
of
the
reason
for
the
injunction
in
this
case,
that
injunction
would
stand
whether
you
have
one
old
lady
with
one
picket
sign
in
front
of
one
--
in
front
of
one
entrance
or
exit
to
the
store
on
the
sidewalk.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
because
that
is
not
the
basis
for
the
injunction.
the
--
perhaps
i
missed
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no.
i
am
not
--
well,
we
are
saying
it's
too
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
--
and
remitted
picketing
to
where,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
we
would
take
the
position
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
that
was
bad,
yes
sir,
because
we
would
take
the
position,
one
of
two
positions
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
that's
not
what
we're
saying.
we're
saying
that
they
have
no
power
to
stop
picketing
in
front
of
a
supermarket
within
a
shopping
center.
they
may
regulate
that
picketing
in
front
of
a
supermarket.
they
may
say
you
may
have
only
one
or
you
may
have
two.
you
must
stay
off
the
pickups
altogether
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
would
be
willing
to
keep
these
people
off
the
pickup
zone,
let
them
stay
on
the
sidewalk
and
we
would
be
content.
all
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
driveway
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
right.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct,
sir.
what
we
are
getting
down
to
say,
you
want
them
off
the
pickup
zone,
keep
them
off
the
pickup
zone.
then
give
them
a
place
on
the
sidewalk
with
reasonable
numbers
which
will
not
interfere
with
access
to
the
store
or
exit
from
but
will
still
permit
them
to
picket.
now,
the
injunctions
below
are
--
so
the
injunction
in
this
case
is
not
at
all
framed
in
those
terms.
it
does
not
go
to
the
regulation
of
the
number
of
pickets
or
the
place
in
front
of
the
store
at
which
they
may
picket.
it
says
you
cannot
come
into
the
shopping
center
at
all,
and
that
is
why
this
case
is
here.
now,
when
the
injunction
was
issued
in
this
case,
picketing
went
on
until
december
27.
an
ex
parte
injunction
was
issued
on
that
day
in
joining
trespassing
and
picketing
on
the
shopping
center.
the
consequence
was
to
take
these
people
away
from
in
front
of
the
supermarket
and
put
them
at
the
highway
entrances.
they
continue
to
picket
at
the
highway
entrances
in
numbers
of
one
or
two,
except
that
one
entrance
which
served
only
the
sears,
roebuck
automotive
station
and
there,
they
didn't
picket
at
all.
at
the
same
time,
they
began
to
distribute
leaflets
at
the
points
of
the
picketing.
the
leaflet
said,
we
appeal
to
our
friends
and
members
of
organized
labor
not
to
patronize
this
nonunion
market.
please
patronize
union
markets
anp,
quaker,
acme.
we
still
retain
the
right
to
ask
the
public
not
to
patronize
nonunion
markets
and
the
public
has
the
right
not
to
patronize
nonunion
markets.
on
january
4,
1966,
the
union
moved
to
dissolve
the
injunction
and
it
made
substantially
two
points.
one
that
picketing
within
the
shopping
center
in
front
of
the
supermarket
premises
was
an
exercise
of
the
right
of
free
speech;
and
two,
that
the
state
court
by
reason
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
had
no
power
to
deal
with
the
controversy.
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
held.
the
injunction
was
made
permanent
and
on
february
14,
1966
and
the
injunction
prohibited
in
so
far
as
it
is
material
to
the
question
we
want
to
bring
here,
trespassing
and
picketing
on
the
shopping
center
premises.
and
the
court
--
the
court
of
common
plea
supported
that
injunction
on
two
grounds.
one,
it
said
this
was
private
property.
it
has
been
opened
only
to
that
part
of
the
public
which
will
make
a
profit
for
the
shopping
center.
it
has
not
been
opened
to
that
part
of
the
public
with
a
labor
message
which
will
cause
the
store
within
the
shopping
center
to
lose
money.
and
the
court
said
secondly
--
this
is
the
court
of
common
pleas
--
that
the
object
of
the
picketing
was
to
coerce
the
employer
to
force
weis'
employees
to
belong
to
the
union.
now,
if
the
injunction
were
to
stand
on
that
premise,
it
would
be
clearly
preempted.
it
would
be
clearly
a
matter
within
the
control
solely
of
the
labor
board.
but
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
affirming
did
not
rest
on
the
ground
of
coercion
of
union
membership.
it
said
it
need
not
reach
that
ground.
it
supported
the
injunction
solely
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
trespass
and
like
the
court
of
common
pleas,
it
said
the
shopping
center
has
invited
to
this
place
only
those
who
will
benefit
it
economically
and
has
not
made
its
invitation
to
all
of
the
world,
particularly
not
to
those
who
would
be
on
economic
disadvantage
to
the
stores.
there
was
a
dissent
with
the
divided
court
four
to
three.
the
dissent
made
two
points.one,
this
was
an
exercise
of
free
speech.
you
cannot
open
the
shopping
center
to
part
of
the
community
and
close
it
to
the
rest
of
the
community.
and
two,
there
were
irreconcilable
conflicts
between
the
injunction
and
rights
conferred
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
brings
us
to
our
first
amendment
point.
free
speech
or
picketing
rather,
peaceful
picketing
is
the
working
man
means
of
communication.
it
is
the
way
in
conventional
labor
disputes
that
the
public
is
told
the
facts
of
the
labor
dispute
from
the
working
man's
point
of
view.
why
then
can
it
be
prohibited
in
this
case?
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
gives
us
one
answer,
it
says,
it's
private
property.
the
title
to
the
property
belongs
to
a
private
holder.
and
to
that,
we
think
the
short
answer
is
the
property
is
private
but
the
use
is
public.
this
shopping
center
is
open
to
the
shopper
and
the
would
be
shopper,
to
the
employee
and
the
would
be
employee,
to
teamsters
delivering
goods
to
the
stores
and
the
salesmen
trying
to
sell
to
the
stores,
to
the
garbage
collector,
the
policemen,
the
postmen,
to
everybody
in
the
community
that
makes
this
center
function.
its
whole
reason
for
being
is
its
openness
to
the
public.
it's
a
public
marketplace
and
on
our
view,
when
you
open
your
property
to
the
public
in
that
fashion,
you
cannot
pick
and
choose
among
that
part
of
the
public
which
you
were
let
in
and
that
part
which
you
will
exclude.
mr.
bernard
dunau
picketing
within
the
store,
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
we
would
not
claim
that
we
have
any
right
to
picket
within
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
because
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
we
think
that
there
is
a
functional
difference
between
the
shopping
center
premises
outside
the
store
where
everyone
is
parking
these
cars,
where
no
one
needs
any
leap
to
walk
its
streets,
and
the
store
function
proper
itself
which
is
we
believe
devoted
to
selling
and
buying,
and
which
that
it
is
inappropriate
in
that
place
to
conduct
peaceful
picketing
or
indeed
to
distribute
handbills.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
because
when
he
says
?for
customers
of
this
store
only?,
he
is
opening
that
parking
lot
to
the
public
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
oh,
that's
correct,
sir.
we
are
not
making
any
claim
here
that
the
shopping
center
intended
to
open
this
shopping
center
to
pickets.
we
are
saying
when
you
open
it
to
as
much
of
the
public
as
a
shopping
center
has
opened
to
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
federal
right
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
you
cannot
close
it
to
the
remainder
of
the
public.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct,
sir,
with
respect
at
least
to
the
entry
of
working
people
for
the
purposes
of
expressing
a
labor
message
connected
with
that
store.
there
may
be
others.
i
may
not
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
we
have
an
easier
case
because
we
have
a
shopping
center.
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
same
rule
applies
to
a
single
parking
lot
associated
with
a
single
store.
our
point
with
respect
to
that
was
stated
at
page
35
by
a
trial
examiner.
the
decision
was
adopted
by
the
board
without
exceptions
to
it,
so
it
is
not
a
decision
by
the
board,
but
our
point
with
respect
to
that
is
well
expressed
by
that
case.
respondent's
parking
lot
was
open
to
and
used
by
the
public,
as
well
as
by
its
employees.in
fact,
it
was
intended
primarily
for
public
use
as
an
adjunct
to
the
store
having
made
the
parking
lot
available
to
the
public.
respondent
may
not
interfere
with
its
employees'
organizational
activities
but
unreasonably
denying
access
to
it
by
union
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
cannot
draw
a
difference
in
theory
or
principle
other
than
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
only
distinction
that
i
can
see
would
be
one
based
on
the
degree
of
openness
to
the
public.
that
one
can
draw
that
line
and
say
that
certainly,
a
shopping
center
is
open
to
that
degree
that
we
can
decide
that
kind
of
a
case
and
reserve
whether
the
lesser
openness,
if
there
is
a
lesser
openness,
as
a
single
parking
lot
attached
to
a
single
store
makes
a
difference.
now,
the
court
below
said,
yes,
it's
open
but
it's
open
only
to
those
who
will
make
a
profit
for
the
center,
and
we
have
not
opened
it
to
anybody
else,
or
the
shopping
center
has
not
opened
it
to
anybody
else.
now,
what
we
get
involved
at
in
that
kind
of
a
distinction
is
this.
if
this
supermarket
were
fronting
on
a
municipally
owned
street,
no
one
could
claim
that
picketing
in
reasonable
numbers
allowing
access
to
the
store
is
not
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
i
think
this
court
has
decided
that
question.
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
court
i
think
has
decided
that
in
thornhill
v.
alabama.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
but
i
think
that
the
rationale
of
thornhill
against
alabama
is
not
limited
solely
to
the
ambiguity
of
the
statute.
at
least
my
understanding
of
thornhill
against
alabama
and
what
a
majority
of
this
court
has
held
in
other
cases
is
that
in
so
far
as
peaceful
picketing,
public
demonstrations
or
the
distribution
of
literature
on
publicly-owned
property
open
to
the
public,
that
constitutes
a
constitutionally
protected
right
and
may
not
be
prohibited.
i
understand
of
course
that
your
honor
has
a
different
view.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
know
of
no
later
case,
your
honor,
which
would
explain
the
way
thornhill
to
the
point
of
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
i
cannot
quarrel
with
a
view
that
peaceful
picketing
because
it
has
aspects
of
conduct,
as
well
as
speech,
has
been
suggested
by
your
honor
to
the
totally
prohibitable
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
with
the
sole
differentiation
being
that
a
government
cannot
discriminate
and
allow
some
peaceful
picketing
to
some
and
prohibited
to
others.
i
can
say
with
respect
to
that
distinction
solely
that
i
do
not
think
this
court
has
embraced
it
and
i
should
hope
that
it
would
not
embrace
it
in
this
case.
now,
if
we
are
right,
if
we
are
right
that
this
peaceful
picketing
cannot
be
prohibited,
if
it
is
conducted
on
a
street
which
faces
on
a
publicly
or
municipally
owned
street,
then
the
sole
distinction
we
have
is
who
owns
the
title
to
the
property.
if
you
have
title
in
the
municipality,
it's
constitutionally
protected.
if
you
have
title
in
a
private
holder,
it
is
not.
and
we
suggest
that
the
test
is
not
who
owns
the
property,
the
municipality
or
a
private
owner,
but
whether
that
property,
whoever
owns
it,
has
been
opened
to
public
use.
and
in
our
view,
this
is
a
very
small
extension,
if
indeed
and
extension
at
all,
to
what
this
court
said
in
marsh
v.
alabama
where
it
said,
the
more
ownership
does
not
always
mean
absolute
dominion,
the
more
an
owner
for
his
advantage
opens
up
his
property
for
use
by
the
public
in
general,
the
more
do
his
rights
become
circumscribed
by
the
statutory
and
constitutional
rights
of
others.
we
think
here
when
a
shopping
center
opens
its
doors
to
the
public-wide,
it
cannot
shut
out
that
part
of
the
public
which
has
a
labor
dispute
with
the
store
within
the
shopping
center
and
confine
it
to
engaging
in
peaceful
picketing
more
than
a
football
business
field
away
from
the
place
where
the
dispute
exists.
now,
the
court
below
says
well,
these
were
never
employees.
the
pickets
were
never
employees
of
weis.
we
have
no
quarrels
with
our
own
employees.
we
have
quarrels
with
other
employees.
we
have
no
quarrels
with
our
own.
these
are
strangers
to
us.
and
for
that
reason,
the
injunction
is
prohibitable.
but
this
court
settled
that
question
a
very
long
time
ago.
it
said
that
you
cannot,
given
the
economic
interdependence
of
industry
today
draw
your
circle
of
economic
competition
so
tight
as
to
contain
only
an
employer
and
his
employees.
and
then,
an
injunction
of
peaceful
picketing
cannot
be
sustained
if
it
is
based
simply
on
the
absence
of
an
employer-employee
relationship.
this
idea
keeps
cropping
up
from
year
to
year.
it's
about
as
hard
an
idea
to
kill
in
this
field
as
exists,
but
it's
dead,
it
was
killed
in
afl
v.
swing
by
this
court,
it
is
killed
by
the
congress
and
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
has
been
killed
by
this
court
in
preemption
cases.
when
you
resurrect
this
idea,
you
simply
indicate
how
retrogressive
in
this
area
this
decision
is.
now,
we're
told
by
the
court
of
common
pleas
at
least
and
by
respondents
in
this
case
where
you
can
picket
out
there
at
the
highway
entrances.
you
don't
have
to
come
in
to
our
parking
lot.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
again
have
the
same
problem
with
that
question
as
i
have
with
the
single
parking
lot
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
to
what
degree
has
it
been
open
to
the
public.
i
can
see
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
my
view,
these
pickets
should
have
a
right
to
be
on
the
22nd
floor
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
is
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no.
we
think
we
have
as
good
an
argument
under
the
preemption
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
have
to
leave
it
to
the
court
as
to
which
ground
it
wants
to
place
its
decision.
from
our
point
of
view,
the
injunction
is
going
to
be
equally
invalid
and
we're
going
to
be
in
as
good
a
position
whether
we
get
it
under
preemption
or
under
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
would
be
our
same
problem,
whether
the
decision
is
grounded
on
the
first
amendment
or
on
preemption.
neither
ground
will
allow
us
to
engage
in
obstructive
picketing.
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
the
state
would
still
have
power
whether
it's
under
the
first
amendment
or
on
a
preemption
assignment
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
have
no
claim
that
the
state
cannot,
no
matter
how
this
injunction
has
upset
either
on
the
first
amendment
or
preemption,
the
state
has
power
to
reach
and
control
obstructive
picketing.
but
we're
told
here
that
the
state
can
enjoin
the
picketing
in
front
of
the
supermarket
and
unobstructive
picketing
is
all
we're
making
a
claim
for
here
in
front
of
the
supermarket
because
you
can
picket
a
high
--
a
more
than
a
football
field
away
at
the
distant
highway
entrances.
and
to
that
our
--
to
that
argument,
our
answer
is
the
question
is
not
whether
we
can
picket
elsewhere;
the
question
is
not
whether
there
are
alternative
means
by
which
we
can
express
our
message.
the
question
is
whether
this
is
an
appropriate
place
to
picket
in
front
of
the
supermarket.
if
this
is
an
inappropriate
place,
it
makes
no
difference
that
there
are
other
appropriate
places.
and
this
is
an
appropriate
place
for
two
reasons.
one,
this
is
where
the
labor
dispute
is
in
front
of
the
supermarket
or
at
the
supermarket
premises,
not
out
there
at
the
shopping
center
which
embraces
the
whole
of
it.
and
this
is
the
audience
we
want
to
reach,
those
who
are
all
going
into
that
supermarket,
the
weis
supermarket,
not
everybody
who's
going
in
to
the
shopping
center.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
i
think
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
would
be
our
view,
sir.
i
would
like
to
make
it
easier
for
us
in
this
case
because
we
have
picketing
here
which
is
not
only
appropriate
because
this
is
the
place
where
you
reach
the
audience,
but
it's
additionally
appropriate
because
this
is
the
place
where
the
dispute
exists.
now,
when
you
have
both,
you
surely
have
an
appropriate
place
to
picket.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
i
suppose
there's
just
as
fresh
air
at
the
highway
entrance
to
that
shopping
center.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
except
on
a
humid
day
where
the
air
conditioned
building
might
be
a
better
place
to
picket.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
that
gets
closer
to
where,
in
my
view
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
get
to
where
i
think
it
becomes
an
interference
with
a
person's
right
to
be
free
from
any
annoyance
at
all,
where
it
is
his
virtually
his
own
home.
if
his
own
home
happens
to
be
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
i
am
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
am
not
suggesting
an
argument
here
which
is
an
absolute
as
one.
i
don't
think
this
kind
of
a
question
can
be
driven
by
soligisms
into
either
one
or
the
other
camp.
i
think
an
apartment
house
where
people
live
is
a
different
place
than
a
business
building,
an
office
building,
and
i
think
an
office
building
is
different
from
a
shopping
center
and
i
think
there
may
be
a
difference
between
a
single
parking
lot
and
a
lot
of
parking
lots,
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede
that
there
is.
but
i'm
not
about
to
say
that
every
place
is
an
appropriate
place
at
which
to
picket
or
distribute
leaflets.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
would
be
my
own
information,
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
decisions
going
both
ways
on
that
particular
question,
but
i
certainly
don't
want
to
be
arguing
that
case
here
today.
now,
with
respect
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
place,
there
was
a
decision
which
came
down
on
march
1,
1968,
this
--
just
this
last
week
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
we
have
reprinted
verbatim
in
a
supplemental
brief.
now,
at
page
14-a,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
touches
precisely
on
this
question.
this
was
a
case
in
which
people
who
wanted
to
protest
the
vietnam
policy
of
the
administration
wanted
to
come
into
the
bus
terminal
in
new
york
city
because
this
was
the
place
they
could
most
appropriately
reach
the
people
they
wanted
to
reach,
and
they
didn't
want
to
stand
outside
on
the
streets.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
bus
terminal
is
virtually
the
equivalent
of
an
open
thoroughfare
and
that
the
people
had
a
right
to
be
within
the
bus
terminal
in
order
to
convey
their
message,
and
they
said
this
specifically
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
question
which
has
just
been
asked.
the
defendant,
the
bus
--
the
port
of
new
york
authority
argues
that
the
inappropriateness
of
the
place
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
walden's
message,
the
fellow
who
wanted
to
propagandize
against
the
vietnam
policy,
there's
no
special
relation
to
the
operations
of
the
terminal.
the
propriety
of
a
place
for
use
as
a
public
forum
does
turn
on
the
relevance
of
the
premises
to
the
protest.
but
this
relationship
may
be
found
in
two
ways.
in
some
situations,
the
place
represents
the
object
of
protest,
the
seat
of
authority
against
which
the
protest
is
directed.
in
other
situations,
the
place
is
where
the
relevant
audience
may
be
found.
so
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
either
situation
would
make
it
an
appropriate
place
in
this
--
and
what
they
saw
in
the
second
circuit
case
was
to
picket
to
distribute
handbills
and
to
set
up
a
table
at
which
they
could
distribute
literature.
now,
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
for
us,
either
would
be
enough
to
establish
that
it
is
an
appropriate
place
to
picket
but
we
have
much
the
easier
of
that
case
because
on
either
test,
this
--
the
premises
of
a
supermarket
is
an
appropriate
place
to
picket.
now,
we're
told
that
picketing
is
more
than
speech.
and
of
course,
it
is
more
than
speech
in
the
sense
that
picketing
does
involve
a
patrol.
but
to
say
that
it
is
more
than
speech
is
not
to
say
that
it
is
not
speech
at
all.
to
say
that
it
is
more
than
speech
under
this
court's
decision
so
far
as
i
understand
that
means
it
can
be
prohibited
if
it
serves
a
valid
governmental
interest.
now,
the
sole
valid
governmental
interest
suggested
in
this
case
is
one
the
fair
title
to
the
property
which
we
think
is
invalid
because
it
ignores
the
distinction
of
the
openness
of
the
shopping
center
to
the
public,
and
secondly,
the
absence
of
an
employer-employee
relationship
which
we
believe
is
invalid
as
well
in
the
circumstances
of
our
times
and
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decisions.
so
we
have
no
way
of
supporting
the
injunction
in
this
case
upon
the
basis
of
it
being
in
furtherance
or
the
prohibition
of
picketing
being
in
furtherance
of
a
valid
governmental
interest.
now
--
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
when
we
say
picketing
is
more
than
speech,
we
mean
only
that
part
of
the
way
in
which
one
communicates
his
message
is
to
either
stand
with
a
placard
or
walk
up
and
down
with
a
placard,
and
when
it
is
that
aspect
of
it
which
we
concede
is
regulable,
we
think
you
can
restrict
the
number
of
persons
who
can
walk
and
the
places
at
which
they
can
walk
so
as
not
to
obstruct
access,
and
that
is
all
we
concede
when
we
say
that
picketing
is
more
than
speech,
that
that
part
of
it
which
is
more
than
speech
is
regulable
but
that
part
of
--
a
part
of
it
which
is
speech,
that
it
is
speech
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
--
which
show
a
prohibition
as
a
result
of
the
picket
line.
we
are
not
about
to
say
that
speech
is
not
speech
simply
because
it
is
directed
at
a
specific
audience
with
a
specific
orientation
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
or
that
they
will,
when
they
see
that
picket
line,
not
cross
because
they've
been
taught
since
childhood
not
to
cross
a
picket
line.
it
is
not
for
our
purposes,
that
is
speech
and
it
is
as
much
speech
because
it
evokes
an
automatic
response
as
a
result
of
the
message
than
if
it
evokes
a
reason
of
response.
we
do
not
think
that
speech
can
be
turned
on
that
kind
of
criteria.
all
we
concede
by
way
of
that
is
that
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decisions,
if
there
is
a
valid
governmental
interest,
it
can
be
prohibited.
we
find
no
valid
governmental
interest
in
this
case.
the
only
other
way
it
can
be
reached
by
government
is
if
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
conducted
is
obstructive
or
unpeaceful,
and
then
we
concede
that
the
excess
can
be
regulated.
you
can
make
it
peaceful
if
it
is
violent.
you
can
reduce
it
to
reasonable
numbers.
you
can
require
that
it
take
place
at
particular
locations
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
access
to
the
premises
or
entrance
--
entrance
or
access,
but
we
do
not
concede
for
one
moment
that
because
it
is
more
than
speech
that
it
can
be
prohibited
in
total.
now,
the
reason
i
think
specifically
in
this
case
that
the
rationale
adopted
by
the
court
below
is
totally
vulnerable
is
if
that
rationale
were
sound,
it
would
prohibit
not
only
peaceful
picketing.
it
would
prohibit
the
distribution
of
leaflets
within
the
shopping
center
at
the
premises
of
the
supermarket
as
well
because
in
terms
of
whether
the
fellow
was
a
trespasser,
he's
a
trespasser
just
as
much
as
if
he's
in
there
carrying
a
placard
or
if
he's
in
there
distributing
leaflets.
if
being
a
trespasser
is
what
is
enough
to
prohibit
the
dissemination
of
information
within
this
shopping
center,
you
can
stop
leaflet
distribution
and
you
can
stop
picketing
and
you
stop
it
by
the
same
argument
and
there
can
be
no
distinction
in
terms
of
whether
this
is
private
property
as
to
whether
you
entered
to
picket
or
you
entered
to
distribute
leaflets.
in
our
view
therefore,
this
picketing
must
be
permitted
under
the
first
amendment.
in
the
circumstances
of
our
times
when
you
have
literally
millions
of
people
shopping
in
shopping
centers
and
literally
millions
of
workers
who
work
within
shopping
centers,
to
say
in
the
year
1968
that
those
workers
and
that
public
may
not
be
reachable
at
the
premises
of
the
store
within
the
shopping
center
is
at
odds
with
the
way
this
world
works
today.
we
reach
our
preemption
argument.
to
a
very
great
degree,
our
preemption
argument
with
respect
to
the
arguably
protective
aspect
of
the
activity
is
a
duplicate
of
our
first
amendment
argument.
conduct
is
preempted
generally
speaking
if
it
is
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
by
filing
a
charge
with
the
labor
board,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no.
i
think
we
reached
that
much
more
directly.
suppose
for
example
in
this
very
case,
the
pickets
were
told
by
the
shopping
center
owner
to
get
off
his
property
in
front
of
the
store
and
to
go
out
and
picket
at
the
highway
entrances.
at
that
point,
that
fellow
who
was
told
to
get
off
the
premises
of
the
shopping
center
--
of
the
store
could
have
filed
a
charge
with
the
labor
board
claiming
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no.
what
he's
claiming
is
that
--
well,
i'm
sorry.
if
he
--
if
the
board
finds
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice,
then
it
is
not
protected
activity.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
no,
no.
not
at
all.
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
union
picket
has
a
right
to
be
at
the
premises
of
the
shopping
center,
the
board
will
decide
is
his
conduct
within
the
protection
of
section
7
of
the
act.
if
it
finds
that
the
employee's
conduct
is
within
the
protection
of
section
7
of
the
act,
then
it
will
find
that
the
employer
has
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
by
prohibiting
into
exercising
that
section
7
right.
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
that
turns
out
whether
it's
protected
by
section
7.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir,
almost
--
well,
yes
sir.
it
has
to
turn
out
whether
it's
protected
by
section
7.
there
is
no
escape
from
that.
when
the
board
decides
that
the
employer's
conduct
interferes
with
restraints
or
coerces
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
guaranteed
by
this
act,
what
it
has
to
go
back
to
is
section
7.
and
so
that
when
we
talk
about
whether
conduct
is
arguably
protected,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
it
is
within
the
safeguard
of
section
7
of
the
act,
and
that
is
a
different
proposition
from
whether
it's
arguably
prohibited,
which
means
not
that
we
have
a
right
to
be
there
because
the
national
labor
relations
act
gives
us
that
right,
but
because
we
have
no
right
to
be
there.
in
fact,
we
are
violating
the
law
by
being
there
and
that
becomes
your
arguably
prohibited
facet
of
the
activity.
in
this
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
it
would
not.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct.
that
doesn't
make
a
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
but
there
are
two
separate
concepts
here.
it
is
not
accurate
to
say
that
the
only
branch
of
this
argument
on
the
preemption
whether
the
conduct
was
arguably
prohibited
that
you
would
come
out
with
the
same
results
as
you
do
when
you
have
both
branches
of
the
argument.
they
are
two
distinct
lines
of
inquiry
and
they
have
to
be
kept
separated.
now,
for
our
purposes
here
when
we
talk
about
arguably
protected,
what
we
ask
is
whether
section
7
in
saying
that
employees
may
engage
in
concerted
activity
for
a
mutual
aid
or
protection,
when
employees
are
guaranteed
that
right
and
engage
in
peaceful
picketing,
are
they
engaging
in
section
7
rights.
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
the
kind
of
peaceful
picketing
which
was
conducted
in
this
case
is
safeguarded
by
section
7
as
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
now,
we
know
that
this
statute
is
even
more
explicit
than
the
generality
of
section
7
in
indicating
the
protection
that
congress
intends
to
give
to
peaceful
picketing.
for
example,
in
prohibiting
the
secondary
boycott,
congress
explicitly
accepts
from
the
prohibition
any
primary
strike
or
any
primary
picketing
in
regulating
organizational
or
recognitional
picketing
with
certain
qualifications
that
explicitly
allows
any
picketing
or
other
publicity
for
the
purpose
of
truthfully
advising
the
public,
including
consumers,
that
an
employer
does
not
employ
members
of
or
have
a
contract
with
a
labor
organization.
surely
then,
this
is
arguably
protected
and
the
only
answer
or
the
only
question
really
with
respect
to
does
it
retain
its
arguably
protective
character
is
does
it
make
a
difference
whether
the
picketing
is
conducted
on
the
open
but
private
property
of
the
person
with
whom
you
had
your
dispute.
now,
the
board
day
in
and
day
out
resolves
clashes
between
a
worker's
claim
that
his
concerted
activity
is
protected
and
an
employer's
claim
that
it
unduly
interferes
with
his
property
rights.
so
this
kind
of
a
clash
is
part
of
the
board's
administrative
routine,
the
handling
of
it.
i
think
i
need
go
no
further
than
the
marshall
field
case.
as
you
all
--
as
the
court
of
courts
knows,
marshall
field
operates
a
big
department
store
in
chicago.
now,
its
building
is
bisected
by
a
private
street.
it
owns
that
street.
but
the
customers
use
the
street
and
the
employees
use
the
street.
and
the
board
said
that
street
must
be
open
to
union
solicitation
on
nonworking
time
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
enforce
that
order
saying
while
privately
owned,
this
street
partakes
of
the
nature
of
a
city
street
or
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
bernard
dunau
only
one
would
draw
distinction
between
placarding
and
talking
or
distributing
literature
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
in
this
case
and
so
far
as
the
activity
conducted
which
was
the
object
of
the
injunction,
it
was
picketing.
i
cannot
now
say
that
the
board
has
had
a
case
which
involved
picketing
as
such
but
which
from
our
point
of
view
certainly
say
breaches
the
result,
it
is
the
board's
business
to
say
whether
solicitation
is
different
from
picketing,
whether
different
rules
should
apply
and
what
should
be
done
with
it.
whether
the
answer
goes
one
way
or
the
other,
the
idea
of
preemption
is
that
the
board
should
give
the
first
answer
to
the
question
and
not
a
court
--
and
not
a
state
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
this
particular
picketing
and
so
far
as
the
record
discloses,
what
it
was
aimed
at
was
to
reach
the
customers
to
persuade
them
not
to
buy
but
in
terms
of
reaching
the
customers
to
persuade
them
not
to
buy,
you
have
the
same
need
of
getting
as
close
to
the
place
where
they
shop
as
you
can,
and
for
the
board,
you
would
then
have
the
same
sort
of
question
in
terms
of
exercising
your
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection
should
be
allowed
to
get
up
to
the
premises
of
the
store
and
to
that
degree,
modify
the
employer's
pure
property
right
saying
his
title
to
his
property
entitles
into
exclude
everybody.
now
the
board
has
in
this
area,
day
in
and
day
out.
it
meets
these
questions
as
to
whether
time
study
engineers
for
example
of
the
unions
can
come
in
to
a
plant.
a
union
organizes
and
get
on
to
a
vessel,
may
they
get
into
a
resort
or
hotel.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
have
been
unable
to
find
a
case
certainly
which
deals
with
peaceful
picketing
on
a
shopping
center.
mr.
bernard
dunau
on
a
shopping
center
as
such.
the
only
case
of
which
i
know
does
not
turn
on
the
question
of
the
arguably
protected
activity.
we
do
have
a
case
which
we
treat
quite
extensively
in
or
brief
in
which
we
point
out
what
happens
in
terms
of
the
--
multiplying
the
risk
of
committing
a
secondary
boycott
when
instead
of
allowing
the
picketing
to
take
place
at
the
premises
of
the
store
within
the
shopping
center,
you
require
that
it
take
place
at
the
perimeter
of
the
shopping
center
with
the
necessary
result
that
in
that
instance
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
no
matter
how
circumscribe
your
picketing
is,
it
reaches
employees
with
whom
you
do
not
have
a
dispute.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i'm
told
it
was
at
the
stores
but
i
have
no
recollection
of
the
specific
facts
at
the
moment,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
one
that
had
a
case
which
confronts
it
precisely
with
this
kind
of
a
problem.
now,
i
was
making
the
point
with
respect
to
secondary
boycotts
because
it
has
have
that
kind
of
a
case
where
the
picketing
is
conducted
for
example
in
one
case
because
the
police
say,
you
cannot
come
in
to
the
shopping
center.
so
per
force,
the
union
has
to
stay
outside
and
then
the
union
gets
involved
in
the
risks
of
circumscribing
its
picketing
so
as
to
confine
its
impact
as
much
as
possible
to
the
employer
within
the
shopping
center
with
whom
it
has
its
dispute
and
not
to
touch
other
employers
with
whom
it
does
not
have
this
dispute.
it
multiplies
risk
for
the
unions
because
no
matter
how
circumspect
you
are,
you
sometimes
even
unwittingly
cross
the
lines
and
you
get
yourself
involved
in
a
secondary
boycott
violation.
it
involves
risk
for
the
other
employers
within
the
shopping
center
because
no
matter
how
circumscribed
and
proper
your
activity
is
at
the
perimeter,
some
overflow,
there
necessarily
has
to
be
to
other
employers.
the
consequence
is
that,
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
where
you
keep
the
picketing
outside
the
shopping
center,
you
are
reaching
many
more
employers
than
you
have
any
reason
or
any
desire
to
reach.
it
creates
secondary
situations.
if
you
allow
the
picketing
to
be
where
it
should
in
our
view
be
in
front
of
the
store
with
whom
the
union
has
its
dispute
or
your
secondary
boycott
complications
fall
out.
in
our
view
therefore,
the
rule
adopted
by
the
court
below
upsets
the
secondary
and
primary
adjustment
which
underlies
the
scheme
here.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
none
of
our
argument
whether
it
goes
to
preemption
or
first
amendment
touches
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
the
number
of
people
to
allow
unimpeded
access.
all
we
are
asking
for
is
a
place
in
reasonable
numbers
in
front
of
the
premises
of
the
store
at
which
to
picket.
we
concede
the
power
of
the
state
whether
the
picketing
is
otherwise
preempted
or
otherwise
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
we
concede
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
the
number
and
the
places.
what
we
do
not
concede
and
what
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
can
you
throw
us
out
of
the
shopping
center
all
together.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
would
say
there
is
preemption
with
respect
to
the
question
whether
the
picketing
can
be
wholly
ousted
from
the
shopping
center.
we
do
not
say
that
there
is
preemption
with
respect
to
whether
picketing
in
front
of
the
premises
maybe
regulated.
we
make
no
such
claims.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
now,
i
think
perhaps
i
can
clarify
that
by
just
looking
at
the
injunction
that
was
entered
and
that
appears
in
several
places
but
pages
2
to
3.
what
we
are
after
in
this
case
of
the
record
is
that
part
of
the
injunction
a
and
b
which
prohibits
blatantly
picketing
and
trespassing
upon
the
private
property
of
plaintiff
weis
markets
and
picketing
and
trespassing
upon
the
private
property
of
plaintiff
logan
valley
plaza.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
are
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
perhaps
that
is
what
it
comes
down
to
because
if
the
record
were
to
support
c,
d,
e
and
f
of
the
injunction
which
is
related
to
obstructive
picketing,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
power
of
the
state
to
enter
c,
d,
e
and
f
and
if
our
quarrel
is
with
the
power
of
the
state
enter
a
and
b
and
why
we
brought
this
case
here
is
to
challenge
the
power
of
the
court
to
enter
a
and
b.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
a
complete
blanket.
now,
if
we
would
have
no
quarrel
with
the
injunction
which
says,
you
may
picket
at
the
premises
in
front
of
the
supermarket
so
long
as
you
do
not
let
us
say
picket
with
more
than
two
or
four
pickets
at
a
new
station
there
at
certain
spots
on
the
sidewalk.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
kind
of
an
injunction.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
don't
want
to
picket
on
the
rest
of
the
parking
lot.
that
is
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
this
--
all
we
want
is
an
opportunity
to
picket
in
front
of
the
supermarket.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
don't
want
to
be
at
the
entrance
of
the
parking
lot.
in
fact,
if
we
were
allowed
to
be
in
front
of
the
premises
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
was
about
to
say,
your
honor,
if
we
were
allowed
to
be
in
front
of
the
premises
of
the
store
within
the
shopping
center,
if
we
then
picketed
at
the
entrances
to
the
shopping
center,
we
would
be
engaging
in
a
secondary
boycott
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
of
the
act,
we
would
be
prohibited
from
doing
that.
the
only
reason
we're
allowed
to
be
there
at
all
is
because
we're
told
you
have
to
be
there
and
there's
no
other
place
to
picket
so
that
we
--
all
of
this
case
comes
down
to
as
can
we
picket
peacefully
in
front
of
the
premises
of
the
supermarket.
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
we
present
today
here
is
the
identical
case
that
was
presented
before
the
court
of
common
pleas.
these
briefs
before
the
court
of
common
pleas
are
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
in
that
court,
what
respondent
sought
they
said,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
court
has
asked
to
prohibit
defendant
from
picketing
rather
the
plaintiffs
request
that
the
court
control
its
location
by
directing
that
the
picketing
take
place
on
the
berm
of
the
public
thoroughfare
and
at
the
conclusion
of
its
brief
in
the
court
of
common
pleas.
the
berms
of
the
public
thoroughfares
provide
a
more
than
adequate
area
from
which
the
defendant
can
picket
and
or
distribute
handbills.
they
wanted
us
off
the
shopping
center.
now,
this
is
what
we
said
in
our
brief
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
at
page
8.
picketing
should
be
allowed
to
continue
near
the
weis
market
store
area
and
the
picket
should
not
be
restrained
to
picket
only
at
the
shopping
center
entrances.
the
defendant
union
would
be
willing
to
negotiate
with
plaintiff
weis
markets
as
to
the
number
of
pickets
to
be
utilized
and
the
manner
of
such
picketing
near
the
weis
market
store
area.
mr.
bernard
dunau
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
state
court
injunction
prohibits
as
trespass
on
private
property,
peaceful
picketing
by
union
men
and
women
in
front
of
a
supermarket
located
within
a
shopping
center,
informing
the
public
that
the
store
is
nonunion.
these
employees
are
not
receiving
union
wages
or
other
union
benefits.
we
have
three
questions.
one,
is
this
prohibition
of
peaceful
picketing
within
the
shopping
center
an
abridgment
of
first
amendment
rights?
two,
is
the
conduct
within
the
sole
governance
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
so
that
the
state
court
has
no
power
to
deal
with
it
at
all
and
three,
if
the
state
court
is
empowered
to
deal
with
the
conduct,
does
the
injunction
prohibit
the
federally
protected
right
conferred
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
engage
in
peaceful
picketing.
now
these
questions
arise
in
this
setting.
logan
valley
mall
is
a
shopping
center.
at
the
time
of
the
events
in
this
case,
it
was
newly
opened.
it's
a
pretty
big
shopping
center.
it
expands
a
perimeter
of
about
1.1
miles.
it
is
located
at
the
intersection
of
two
public
highways.
the
highways
are
separated
from
the
shopping
center
by
what
are
called
earthen
berms
which
is
an
earthen
embankment
with
a
ditch.
the
highways
are
separated
from
the
shopping
center
by
earthen
berms,
b
e
r
m
s
embankments,
they're
just
--
it's
just
dirt
road
and
that's
about
all
i
can
see
that
it
means
there's
a
ditch
along
this
berm.
this
is
unbroken
except
for
five
paved
entrances
which
provide
ingress
and
egress
to
the
shopping
center.
the
paved
entrances
are
about
20-feet
in
width,
the
berms
vary
from
12
to
15
feet
in
width.
now,
from
the
entrances
to
the
shopping
center
and
the
weis
supermarket
which
is
the
store
involved
in
this
case,
entrances
one
and
two
are
about
350
feet
distant.
entrance
three
a
little
further
and
entrance
four
and
five
are
about
450
to
500
feet
from
the
highway
entrance
to
the
weis
supermarket.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
what
separates
the
buildings
from
the
highway
are
parking
areas
and
pedestrian
ways.
the
usual
set
up
of
a
shopping
center
of
places
where
you
park
your
cars,
roads
so
that
you
can
maneuver
your
cars
within
the
shopping
center
and
sidewalks
where
shoppers
can
go.
now
when
this
shopping
center
opened
for
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
there's
a
fence
around
it.
when
this
shopping
center
opened
for
business,
the
two
occupants
were
weis
markets
which
is
a
supermarket
selling
food
and
other
household
articles
and
sears,
roebuck
and
company
which
operated
a
department
store
and
which
operates
an
automotive
service
station.
there
are
now
15
additional
tenants.
there's
jc
penney,
the
shopping
center
now
performs
all
of
the
usual
retail
services
associated
with
the
shopping
center.
now,
when
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
it
is.
it's
a
short
distance
from
altona,
it's
something
called
logan
township
which
i
gather
is
a
suburban
area,
yes
your
honor.
when
logan
valley
opened
for
business
on
december
8,
1965,
it
employed
only
nonunion
people.
a
few
days
later
after
it
opened,
it
posted
its
property
with
a
sign
which
said,
no
trespassing
or
soliciting
is
allowed
on
weis
market
porch
or
parking
lot
by
anyone
except
weis
employees
without
the
consent
of
the
management.
on
december
17th,
picketing
began.the
average
numbers
of
pickets
were
five,
six
or
seven.
they
were
men
and
women.
they
were
members
of
the
amalgamated
meat
cutters
union.
they
work
for
other
neighboring
stores
acme,
anp,
quaker
and
they
volunteer
to
picket
on
their
own
time.
and
they
picketed
with
signs
which
said,
the
store
is
nonunion,
the
employees
are
not
receiving
union
wages
or
other
union
benefits.
mr.
bernard
dunau
on
one
night,
there
were
13
pickets
and
the
witness
testifying
as
to
their
conduct
said,
they
walk,
two
have
rest
and
sometimes
three
and
four.
now
with
respect,
perhaps
i
should
say
immediately
at
this
point.
there
is
a
claim
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
this
picketing
was
physical
obstructive.
the
finding
is
to
the
contrary.
the
finding
is
in
both
courts
below
were
emphatic
that
the
picketing
was
entirely
peaceful
in
nature.
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
there
is
no
question
that
the
picketing
which
was
conducted
at
and
in
the
pick
up
zone
which
is
in
front
of
the
sidewalk.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
the
best
way
i
can
reach
that
your
honor
is
to
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
word
peaceful
excludes
the
obstruction.
now,
with
respect
to
that,
however,
i
would
like
to
read
the
specific
finding
of
the
court
below
on
the
subject.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
of
--
we
have
it
on
page
6
of
our
reply
brief.
it's
at
page
89
to
90
of
the
record.
the
court
first
recites
that
small
groups
of
men
and
women
wearing
placards,
weis
markets
is
nonunion,
these
employees
are
not
receiving
union
wages
or
other
union
benefits
work
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
weis
supermarket
more
particularly
in
the
pickup
zone
adjacent
to
the
covered
porch.
occasional
picketing
as
above
described
has
taken
place
on
the
covered
porch
itself
and
this
i
think
is
the
critical
finding
while
such
picketing
has
been
persisted
in
and
may
have,
not
did,
may
have
infrequently
caused
temporary
congestion
near
the
so
--
supermarket
entrances
or
sporadic
stoppage
of
the
flow
of
vehicles
in
the
pickup
zone.
and
while
the
pickets
refused
a
request
by
the
assistant
general
superintendent
for
weis
markets
to
move
off
the
mall
proper,
the
picketing
has
been
peaceful
and
unaccompanied
by
either
oral
threats
or
actual
violence.
now,
even
the
introductory
qualification
does
not
say
that
there
was
an
obstruction
of
the
pickup
zone.it
says
there
may
have
been,
not
that
there
was,
and
if
there
was,
it
was
infrequent,
temporary,
sporadic.
we
do
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
were
primarily
in
the
pickup
zone
which
is
on
the
street
in
front
of
the
sidewalk.
they
were
very
occasionally
on
the
sidewalk
itself.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
put
it
this
way.
mr.
bernard
dunau
there's
a
pretty
good
diagram
of
it
at
page
4
of
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
picketing
at
the
pickup
zone
had
a
possibility
of
interfering
with
the
traffic
flow
in
and
out
of
the
picket
zone
--
pickup
zone,
and
therefore,
i
would
say
that
the
ideal
place
for
those
pickets
to
have
been
would
have
been
on
the
sidewalk
and
not
in
the
pickup
zone,
and
we
would
be
perfectly
content
to
have
them
on
the
sidewalk
and
not
in
the
picket
zone
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
in
reasonable
numbers.
mr.
bernard
dunau
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
primarily
in
the
pickup
zone
and
occasionally
on
the
sidewalk,
but
they
were
in
both
places,
yes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
as
a
matter
of
fact,
however,
the
case
does
not
turn
on
whether
they
were
in
the
pickup
zone
or
on
the
sidewalk
because
what
both
courts
below
found
is
that
they
shouldn't
have
been
any
place
in
the
vicinity
of
the
store.
they
should
have
been
at
the
highway
entrances.
so
is
that
in
terms
of
the
reason
for
the
injunction
in
this
case,
that
injunction
would
stand
whether
you
have
one
old
lady
with
one
picket
sign
in
front
of
one
--
in
front
of
one
entrance
or
exit
to
the
store
on
the
sidewalk.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
because
that
is
not
the
basis
for
the
injunction.
the
--
perhaps
i
missed
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no.
i
am
not
--
well,
we
are
saying
it's
too
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
--
and
remitted
picketing
to
where,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
we
would
take
the
position
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
that
was
bad,
yes
sir,
because
we
would
take
the
position,
one
of
two
positions
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
that's
not
what
we're
saying.
we're
saying
that
they
have
no
power
to
stop
picketing
in
front
of
a
supermarket
within
a
shopping
center.
they
may
regulate
that
picketing
in
front
of
a
supermarket.
they
may
say
you
may
have
only
one
or
you
may
have
two.
you
must
stay
off
the
pickups
altogether
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
would
be
willing
to
keep
these
people
off
the
pickup
zone,
let
them
stay
on
the
sidewalk
and
we
would
be
content.
all
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
driveway
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
right.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct,
sir.
what
we
are
getting
down
to
say,
you
want
them
off
the
pickup
zone,
keep
them
off
the
pickup
zone.
then
give
them
a
place
on
the
sidewalk
with
reasonable
numbers
which
will
not
interfere
with
access
to
the
store
or
exit
from
but
will
still
permit
them
to
picket.
now,
the
injunctions
below
are
--
so
the
injunction
in
this
case
is
not
at
all
framed
in
those
terms.
it
does
not
go
to
the
regulation
of
the
number
of
pickets
or
the
place
in
front
of
the
store
at
which
they
may
picket.
it
says
you
cannot
come
into
the
shopping
center
at
all,
and
that
is
why
this
case
is
here.
now,
when
the
injunction
was
issued
in
this
case,
picketing
went
on
until
december
27.
an
ex
parte
injunction
was
issued
on
that
day
in
joining
trespassing
and
picketing
on
the
shopping
center.
the
consequence
was
to
take
these
people
away
from
in
front
of
the
supermarket
and
put
them
at
the
highway
entrances.
they
continue
to
picket
at
the
highway
entrances
in
numbers
of
one
or
two,
except
that
one
entrance
which
served
only
the
sears,
roebuck
automotive
station
and
there,
they
didn't
picket
at
all.
at
the
same
time,
they
began
to
distribute
leaflets
at
the
points
of
the
picketing.
the
leaflet
said,
we
appeal
to
our
friends
and
members
of
organized
labor
not
to
patronize
this
nonunion
market.
please
patronize
union
markets
anp,
quaker,
acme.
we
still
retain
the
right
to
ask
the
public
not
to
patronize
nonunion
markets
and
the
public
has
the
right
not
to
patronize
nonunion
markets.
on
january
4,
1966,
the
union
moved
to
dissolve
the
injunction
and
it
made
substantially
two
points.
one
that
picketing
within
the
shopping
center
in
front
of
the
supermarket
premises
was
an
exercise
of
the
right
of
free
speech;
and
two,
that
the
state
court
by
reason
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
had
no
power
to
deal
with
the
controversy.
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
held.
the
injunction
was
made
permanent
and
on
february
14,
1966
and
the
injunction
prohibited
in
so
far
as
it
is
material
to
the
question
we
want
to
bring
here,
trespassing
and
picketing
on
the
shopping
center
premises.
and
the
court
--
the
court
of
common
plea
supported
that
injunction
on
two
grounds.
one,
it
said
this
was
private
property.
it
has
been
opened
only
to
that
part
of
the
public
which
will
make
a
profit
for
the
shopping
center.
it
has
not
been
opened
to
that
part
of
the
public
with
a
labor
message
which
will
cause
the
store
within
the
shopping
center
to
lose
money.
and
the
court
said
secondly
--
this
is
the
court
of
common
pleas
--
that
the
object
of
the
picketing
was
to
coerce
the
employer
to
force
weis'
employees
to
belong
to
the
union.
now,
if
the
injunction
were
to
stand
on
that
premise,
it
would
be
clearly
preempted.
it
would
be
clearly
a
matter
within
the
control
solely
of
the
labor
board.
but
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
affirming
did
not
rest
on
the
ground
of
coercion
of
union
membership.
it
said
it
need
not
reach
that
ground.
it
supported
the
injunction
solely
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
trespass
and
like
the
court
of
common
pleas,
it
said
the
shopping
center
has
invited
to
this
place
only
those
who
will
benefit
it
economically
and
has
not
made
its
invitation
to
all
of
the
world,
particularly
not
to
those
who
would
be
on
economic
disadvantage
to
the
stores.
there
was
a
dissent
with
the
divided
court
four
to
three.
the
dissent
made
two
points.one,
this
was
an
exercise
of
free
speech.
you
cannot
open
the
shopping
center
to
part
of
the
community
and
close
it
to
the
rest
of
the
community.
and
two,
there
were
irreconcilable
conflicts
between
the
injunction
and
rights
conferred
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
brings
us
to
our
first
amendment
point.
free
speech
or
picketing
rather,
peaceful
picketing
is
the
working
man
means
of
communication.
it
is
the
way
in
conventional
labor
disputes
that
the
public
is
told
the
facts
of
the
labor
dispute
from
the
working
man's
point
of
view.
why
then
can
it
be
prohibited
in
this
case?
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
gives
us
one
answer,
it
says,
it's
private
property.
the
title
to
the
property
belongs
to
a
private
holder.
and
to
that,
we
think
the
short
answer
is
the
property
is
private
but
the
use
is
public.
this
shopping
center
is
open
to
the
shopper
and
the
would
be
shopper,
to
the
employee
and
the
would
be
employee,
to
teamsters
delivering
goods
to
the
stores
and
the
salesmen
trying
to
sell
to
the
stores,
to
the
garbage
collector,
the
policemen,
the
postmen,
to
everybody
in
the
community
that
makes
this
center
function.
its
whole
reason
for
being
is
its
openness
to
the
public.
it's
a
public
marketplace
and
on
our
view,
when
you
open
your
property
to
the
public
in
that
fashion,
you
cannot
pick
and
choose
among
that
part
of
the
public
which
you
were
let
in
and
that
part
which
you
will
exclude.
mr.
bernard
dunau
picketing
within
the
store,
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
we
would
not
claim
that
we
have
any
right
to
picket
within
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
because
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
we
think
that
there
is
a
functional
difference
between
the
shopping
center
premises
outside
the
store
where
everyone
is
parking
these
cars,
where
no
one
needs
any
leap
to
walk
its
streets,
and
the
store
function
proper
itself
which
is
we
believe
devoted
to
selling
and
buying,
and
which
that
it
is
inappropriate
in
that
place
to
conduct
peaceful
picketing
or
indeed
to
distribute
handbills.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
because
when
he
says
?for
customers
of
this
store
only?,
he
is
opening
that
parking
lot
to
the
public
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
oh,
that's
correct,
sir.
we
are
not
making
any
claim
here
that
the
shopping
center
intended
to
open
this
shopping
center
to
pickets.
we
are
saying
when
you
open
it
to
as
much
of
the
public
as
a
shopping
center
has
opened
to
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
federal
right
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
you
cannot
close
it
to
the
remainder
of
the
public.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct,
sir,
with
respect
at
least
to
the
entry
of
working
people
for
the
purposes
of
expressing
a
labor
message
connected
with
that
store.
there
may
be
others.
i
may
not
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
we
have
an
easier
case
because
we
have
a
shopping
center.
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
same
rule
applies
to
a
single
parking
lot
associated
with
a
single
store.
our
point
with
respect
to
that
was
stated
at
page
35
by
a
trial
examiner.
the
decision
was
adopted
by
the
board
without
exceptions
to
it,
so
it
is
not
a
decision
by
the
board,
but
our
point
with
respect
to
that
is
well
expressed
by
that
case.
respondent's
parking
lot
was
open
to
and
used
by
the
public,
as
well
as
by
its
employees.in
fact,
it
was
intended
primarily
for
public
use
as
an
adjunct
to
the
store
having
made
the
parking
lot
available
to
the
public.
respondent
may
not
interfere
with
its
employees'
organizational
activities
but
unreasonably
denying
access
to
it
by
union
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
cannot
draw
a
difference
in
theory
or
principle
other
than
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
only
distinction
that
i
can
see
would
be
one
based
on
the
degree
of
openness
to
the
public.
that
one
can
draw
that
line
and
say
that
certainly,
a
shopping
center
is
open
to
that
degree
that
we
can
decide
that
kind
of
a
case
and
reserve
whether
the
lesser
openness,
if
there
is
a
lesser
openness,
as
a
single
parking
lot
attached
to
a
single
store
makes
a
difference.
now,
the
court
below
said,
yes,
it's
open
but
it's
open
only
to
those
who
will
make
a
profit
for
the
center,
and
we
have
not
opened
it
to
anybody
else,
or
the
shopping
center
has
not
opened
it
to
anybody
else.
now,
what
we
get
involved
at
in
that
kind
of
a
distinction
is
this.
if
this
supermarket
were
fronting
on
a
municipally
owned
street,
no
one
could
claim
that
picketing
in
reasonable
numbers
allowing
access
to
the
store
is
not
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
i
think
this
court
has
decided
that
question.
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
court
i
think
has
decided
that
in
thornhill
v.
alabama.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
but
i
think
that
the
rationale
of
thornhill
against
alabama
is
not
limited
solely
to
the
ambiguity
of
the
statute.
at
least
my
understanding
of
thornhill
against
alabama
and
what
a
majority
of
this
court
has
held
in
other
cases
is
that
in
so
far
as
peaceful
picketing,
public
demonstrations
or
the
distribution
of
literature
on
publicly-owned
property
open
to
the
public,
that
constitutes
a
constitutionally
protected
right
and
may
not
be
prohibited.
i
understand
of
course
that
your
honor
has
a
different
view.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
know
of
no
later
case,
your
honor,
which
would
explain
the
way
thornhill
to
the
point
of
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
i
cannot
quarrel
with
a
view
that
peaceful
picketing
because
it
has
aspects
of
conduct,
as
well
as
speech,
has
been
suggested
by
your
honor
to
the
totally
prohibitable
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
with
the
sole
differentiation
being
that
a
government
cannot
discriminate
and
allow
some
peaceful
picketing
to
some
and
prohibited
to
others.
i
can
say
with
respect
to
that
distinction
solely
that
i
do
not
think
this
court
has
embraced
it
and
i
should
hope
that
it
would
not
embrace
it
in
this
case.
now,
if
we
are
right,
if
we
are
right
that
this
peaceful
picketing
cannot
be
prohibited,
if
it
is
conducted
on
a
street
which
faces
on
a
publicly
or
municipally
owned
street,
then
the
sole
distinction
we
have
is
who
owns
the
title
to
the
property.
if
you
have
title
in
the
municipality,
it's
constitutionally
protected.
if
you
have
title
in
a
private
holder,
it
is
not.
and
we
suggest
that
the
test
is
not
who
owns
the
property,
the
municipality
or
a
private
owner,
but
whether
that
property,
whoever
owns
it,
has
been
opened
to
public
use.
and
in
our
view,
this
is
a
very
small
extension,
if
indeed
and
extension
at
all,
to
what
this
court
said
in
marsh
v.
alabama
where
it
said,
the
more
ownership
does
not
always
mean
absolute
dominion,
the
more
an
owner
for
his
advantage
opens
up
his
property
for
use
by
the
public
in
general,
the
more
do
his
rights
become
circumscribed
by
the
statutory
and
constitutional
rights
of
others.
we
think
here
when
a
shopping
center
opens
its
doors
to
the
public-wide,
it
cannot
shut
out
that
part
of
the
public
which
has
a
labor
dispute
with
the
store
within
the
shopping
center
and
confine
it
to
engaging
in
peaceful
picketing
more
than
a
football
business
field
away
from
the
place
where
the
dispute
exists.
now,
the
court
below
says
well,
these
were
never
employees.
the
pickets
were
never
employees
of
weis.
we
have
no
quarrels
with
our
own
employees.
we
have
quarrels
with
other
employees.
we
have
no
quarrels
with
our
own.
these
are
strangers
to
us.
and
for
that
reason,
the
injunction
is
prohibitable.
but
this
court
settled
that
question
a
very
long
time
ago.
it
said
that
you
cannot,
given
the
economic
interdependence
of
industry
today
draw
your
circle
of
economic
competition
so
tight
as
to
contain
only
an
employer
and
his
employees.
and
then,
an
injunction
of
peaceful
picketing
cannot
be
sustained
if
it
is
based
simply
on
the
absence
of
an
employer-employee
relationship.
this
idea
keeps
cropping
up
from
year
to
year.
it's
about
as
hard
an
idea
to
kill
in
this
field
as
exists,
but
it's
dead,
it
was
killed
in
afl
v.
swing
by
this
court,
it
is
killed
by
the
congress
and
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
has
been
killed
by
this
court
in
preemption
cases.
when
you
resurrect
this
idea,
you
simply
indicate
how
retrogressive
in
this
area
this
decision
is.
now,
we're
told
by
the
court
of
common
pleas
at
least
and
by
respondents
in
this
case
where
you
can
picket
out
there
at
the
highway
entrances.
you
don't
have
to
come
in
to
our
parking
lot.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
again
have
the
same
problem
with
that
question
as
i
have
with
the
single
parking
lot
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
to
what
degree
has
it
been
open
to
the
public.
i
can
see
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
my
view,
these
pickets
should
have
a
right
to
be
on
the
22nd
floor
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
is
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no.
we
think
we
have
as
good
an
argument
under
the
preemption
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
have
to
leave
it
to
the
court
as
to
which
ground
it
wants
to
place
its
decision.
from
our
point
of
view,
the
injunction
is
going
to
be
equally
invalid
and
we're
going
to
be
in
as
good
a
position
whether
we
get
it
under
preemption
or
under
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
would
be
our
same
problem,
whether
the
decision
is
grounded
on
the
first
amendment
or
on
preemption.
neither
ground
will
allow
us
to
engage
in
obstructive
picketing.
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
the
state
would
still
have
power
whether
it's
under
the
first
amendment
or
on
a
preemption
assignment
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
have
no
claim
that
the
state
cannot,
no
matter
how
this
injunction
has
upset
either
on
the
first
amendment
or
preemption,
the
state
has
power
to
reach
and
control
obstructive
picketing.
but
we're
told
here
that
the
state
can
enjoin
the
picketing
in
front
of
the
supermarket
and
unobstructive
picketing
is
all
we're
making
a
claim
for
here
in
front
of
the
supermarket
because
you
can
picket
a
high
--
a
more
than
a
football
field
away
at
the
distant
highway
entrances.
and
to
that
our
--
to
that
argument,
our
answer
is
the
question
is
not
whether
we
can
picket
elsewhere;
the
question
is
not
whether
there
are
alternative
means
by
which
we
can
express
our
message.
the
question
is
whether
this
is
an
appropriate
place
to
picket
in
front
of
the
supermarket.
if
this
is
an
inappropriate
place,
it
makes
no
difference
that
there
are
other
appropriate
places.
and
this
is
an
appropriate
place
for
two
reasons.
one,
this
is
where
the
labor
dispute
is
in
front
of
the
supermarket
or
at
the
supermarket
premises,
not
out
there
at
the
shopping
center
which
embraces
the
whole
of
it.
and
this
is
the
audience
we
want
to
reach,
those
who
are
all
going
into
that
supermarket,
the
weis
supermarket,
not
everybody
who's
going
in
to
the
shopping
center.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
i
think
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
would
be
our
view,
sir.
i
would
like
to
make
it
easier
for
us
in
this
case
because
we
have
picketing
here
which
is
not
only
appropriate
because
this
is
the
place
where
you
reach
the
audience,
but
it's
additionally
appropriate
because
this
is
the
place
where
the
dispute
exists.
now,
when
you
have
both,
you
surely
have
an
appropriate
place
to
picket.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
i
suppose
there's
just
as
fresh
air
at
the
highway
entrance
to
that
shopping
center.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
except
on
a
humid
day
where
the
air
conditioned
building
might
be
a
better
place
to
picket.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
that
gets
closer
to
where,
in
my
view
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
get
to
where
i
think
it
becomes
an
interference
with
a
person's
right
to
be
free
from
any
annoyance
at
all,
where
it
is
his
virtually
his
own
home.
if
his
own
home
happens
to
be
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
i
am
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
am
not
suggesting
an
argument
here
which
is
an
absolute
as
one.
i
don't
think
this
kind
of
a
question
can
be
driven
by
soligisms
into
either
one
or
the
other
camp.
i
think
an
apartment
house
where
people
live
is
a
different
place
than
a
business
building,
an
office
building,
and
i
think
an
office
building
is
different
from
a
shopping
center
and
i
think
there
may
be
a
difference
between
a
single
parking
lot
and
a
lot
of
parking
lots,
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede
that
there
is.
but
i'm
not
about
to
say
that
every
place
is
an
appropriate
place
at
which
to
picket
or
distribute
leaflets.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
would
be
my
own
information,
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
decisions
going
both
ways
on
that
particular
question,
but
i
certainly
don't
want
to
be
arguing
that
case
here
today.
now,
with
respect
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
place,
there
was
a
decision
which
came
down
on
march
1,
1968,
this
--
just
this
last
week
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
we
have
reprinted
verbatim
in
a
supplemental
brief.
now,
at
page
14-a,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
touches
precisely
on
this
question.
this
was
a
case
in
which
people
who
wanted
to
protest
the
vietnam
policy
of
the
administration
wanted
to
come
into
the
bus
terminal
in
new
york
city
because
this
was
the
place
they
could
most
appropriately
reach
the
people
they
wanted
to
reach,
and
they
didn't
want
to
stand
outside
on
the
streets.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
bus
terminal
is
virtually
the
equivalent
of
an
open
thoroughfare
and
that
the
people
had
a
right
to
be
within
the
bus
terminal
in
order
to
convey
their
message,
and
they
said
this
specifically
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
question
which
has
just
been
asked.
the
defendant,
the
bus
--
the
port
of
new
york
authority
argues
that
the
inappropriateness
of
the
place
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
walden's
message,
the
fellow
who
wanted
to
propagandize
against
the
vietnam
policy,
there's
no
special
relation
to
the
operations
of
the
terminal.
the
propriety
of
a
place
for
use
as
a
public
forum
does
turn
on
the
relevance
of
the
premises
to
the
protest.
but
this
relationship
may
be
found
in
two
ways.
in
some
situations,
the
place
represents
the
object
of
protest,
the
seat
of
authority
against
which
the
protest
is
directed.
in
other
situations,
the
place
is
where
the
relevant
audience
may
be
found.
so
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
either
situation
would
make
it
an
appropriate
place
in
this
--
and
what
they
saw
in
the
second
circuit
case
was
to
picket
to
distribute
handbills
and
to
set
up
a
table
at
which
they
could
distribute
literature.
now,
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
for
us,
either
would
be
enough
to
establish
that
it
is
an
appropriate
place
to
picket
but
we
have
much
the
easier
of
that
case
because
on
either
test,
this
--
the
premises
of
a
supermarket
is
an
appropriate
place
to
picket.
now,
we're
told
that
picketing
is
more
than
speech.
and
of
course,
it
is
more
than
speech
in
the
sense
that
picketing
does
involve
a
patrol.
but
to
say
that
it
is
more
than
speech
is
not
to
say
that
it
is
not
speech
at
all.
to
say
that
it
is
more
than
speech
under
this
court's
decision
so
far
as
i
understand
that
means
it
can
be
prohibited
if
it
serves
a
valid
governmental
interest.
now,
the
sole
valid
governmental
interest
suggested
in
this
case
is
one
the
fair
title
to
the
property
which
we
think
is
invalid
because
it
ignores
the
distinction
of
the
openness
of
the
shopping
center
to
the
public,
and
secondly,
the
absence
of
an
employer-employee
relationship
which
we
believe
is
invalid
as
well
in
the
circumstances
of
our
times
and
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decisions.
so
we
have
no
way
of
supporting
the
injunction
in
this
case
upon
the
basis
of
it
being
in
furtherance
or
the
prohibition
of
picketing
being
in
furtherance
of
a
valid
governmental
interest.
now
--
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
when
we
say
picketing
is
more
than
speech,
we
mean
only
that
part
of
the
way
in
which
one
communicates
his
message
is
to
either
stand
with
a
placard
or
walk
up
and
down
with
a
placard,
and
when
it
is
that
aspect
of
it
which
we
concede
is
regulable,
we
think
you
can
restrict
the
number
of
persons
who
can
walk
and
the
places
at
which
they
can
walk
so
as
not
to
obstruct
access,
and
that
is
all
we
concede
when
we
say
that
picketing
is
more
than
speech,
that
that
part
of
it
which
is
more
than
speech
is
regulable
but
that
part
of
--
a
part
of
it
which
is
speech,
that
it
is
speech
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
--
which
show
a
prohibition
as
a
result
of
the
picket
line.
we
are
not
about
to
say
that
speech
is
not
speech
simply
because
it
is
directed
at
a
specific
audience
with
a
specific
orientation
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
or
that
they
will,
when
they
see
that
picket
line,
not
cross
because
they've
been
taught
since
childhood
not
to
cross
a
picket
line.
it
is
not
for
our
purposes,
that
is
speech
and
it
is
as
much
speech
because
it
evokes
an
automatic
response
as
a
result
of
the
message
than
if
it
evokes
a
reason
of
response.
we
do
not
think
that
speech
can
be
turned
on
that
kind
of
criteria.
all
we
concede
by
way
of
that
is
that
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decisions,
if
there
is
a
valid
governmental
interest,
it
can
be
prohibited.
we
find
no
valid
governmental
interest
in
this
case.
the
only
other
way
it
can
be
reached
by
government
is
if
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
conducted
is
obstructive
or
unpeaceful,
and
then
we
concede
that
the
excess
can
be
regulated.
you
can
make
it
peaceful
if
it
is
violent.
you
can
reduce
it
to
reasonable
numbers.
you
can
require
that
it
take
place
at
particular
locations
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
access
to
the
premises
or
entrance
--
entrance
or
access,
but
we
do
not
concede
for
one
moment
that
because
it
is
more
than
speech
that
it
can
be
prohibited
in
total.
now,
the
reason
i
think
specifically
in
this
case
that
the
rationale
adopted
by
the
court
below
is
totally
vulnerable
is
if
that
rationale
were
sound,
it
would
prohibit
not
only
peaceful
picketing.
it
would
prohibit
the
distribution
of
leaflets
within
the
shopping
center
at
the
premises
of
the
supermarket
as
well
because
in
terms
of
whether
the
fellow
was
a
trespasser,
he's
a
trespasser
just
as
much
as
if
he's
in
there
carrying
a
placard
or
if
he's
in
there
distributing
leaflets.
if
being
a
trespasser
is
what
is
enough
to
prohibit
the
dissemination
of
information
within
this
shopping
center,
you
can
stop
leaflet
distribution
and
you
can
stop
picketing
and
you
stop
it
by
the
same
argument
and
there
can
be
no
distinction
in
terms
of
whether
this
is
private
property
as
to
whether
you
entered
to
picket
or
you
entered
to
distribute
leaflets.
in
our
view
therefore,
this
picketing
must
be
permitted
under
the
first
amendment.
in
the
circumstances
of
our
times
when
you
have
literally
millions
of
people
shopping
in
shopping
centers
and
literally
millions
of
workers
who
work
within
shopping
centers,
to
say
in
the
year
1968
that
those
workers
and
that
public
may
not
be
reachable
at
the
premises
of
the
store
within
the
shopping
center
is
at
odds
with
the
way
this
world
works
today.
we
reach
our
preemption
argument.
to
a
very
great
degree,
our
preemption
argument
with
respect
to
the
arguably
protective
aspect
of
the
activity
is
a
duplicate
of
our
first
amendment
argument.
conduct
is
preempted
generally
speaking
if
it
is
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
by
filing
a
charge
with
the
labor
board,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no.
i
think
we
reached
that
much
more
directly.
suppose
for
example
in
this
very
case,
the
pickets
were
told
by
the
shopping
center
owner
to
get
off
his
property
in
front
of
the
store
and
to
go
out
and
picket
at
the
highway
entrances.
at
that
point,
that
fellow
who
was
told
to
get
off
the
premises
of
the
shopping
center
--
of
the
store
could
have
filed
a
charge
with
the
labor
board
claiming
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no.
what
he's
claiming
is
that
--
well,
i'm
sorry.
if
he
--
if
the
board
finds
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice,
then
it
is
not
protected
activity.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
no,
no.
not
at
all.
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
union
picket
has
a
right
to
be
at
the
premises
of
the
shopping
center,
the
board
will
decide
is
his
conduct
within
the
protection
of
section
7
of
the
act.
if
it
finds
that
the
employee's
conduct
is
within
the
protection
of
section
7
of
the
act,
then
it
will
find
that
the
employer
has
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
by
prohibiting
into
exercising
that
section
7
right.
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
that
turns
out
whether
it's
protected
by
section
7.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir,
almost
--
well,
yes
sir.
it
has
to
turn
out
whether
it's
protected
by
section
7.
there
is
no
escape
from
that.
when
the
board
decides
that
the
employer's
conduct
interferes
with
restraints
or
coerces
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
guaranteed
by
this
act,
what
it
has
to
go
back
to
is
section
7.
and
so
that
when
we
talk
about
whether
conduct
is
arguably
protected,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
it
is
within
the
safeguard
of
section
7
of
the
act,
and
that
is
a
different
proposition
from
whether
it's
arguably
prohibited,
which
means
not
that
we
have
a
right
to
be
there
because
the
national
labor
relations
act
gives
us
that
right,
but
because
we
have
no
right
to
be
there.
in
fact,
we
are
violating
the
law
by
being
there
and
that
becomes
your
arguably
prohibited
facet
of
the
activity.
in
this
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
it
would
not.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct.
that
doesn't
make
a
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
but
there
are
two
separate
concepts
here.
it
is
not
accurate
to
say
that
the
only
branch
of
this
argument
on
the
preemption
whether
the
conduct
was
arguably
prohibited
that
you
would
come
out
with
the
same
results
as
you
do
when
you
have
both
branches
of
the
argument.
they
are
two
distinct
lines
of
inquiry
and
they
have
to
be
kept
separated.
now,
for
our
purposes
here
when
we
talk
about
arguably
protected,
what
we
ask
is
whether
section
7
in
saying
that
employees
may
engage
in
concerted
activity
for
a
mutual
aid
or
protection,
when
employees
are
guaranteed
that
right
and
engage
in
peaceful
picketing,
are
they
engaging
in
section
7
rights.
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
the
kind
of
peaceful
picketing
which
was
conducted
in
this
case
is
safeguarded
by
section
7
as
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
now,
we
know
that
this
statute
is
even
more
explicit
than
the
generality
of
section
7
in
indicating
the
protection
that
congress
intends
to
give
to
peaceful
picketing.
for
example,
in
prohibiting
the
secondary
boycott,
congress
explicitly
accepts
from
the
prohibition
any
primary
strike
or
any
primary
picketing
in
regulating
organizational
or
recognitional
picketing
with
certain
qualifications
that
explicitly
allows
any
picketing
or
other
publicity
for
the
purpose
of
truthfully
advising
the
public,
including
consumers,
that
an
employer
does
not
employ
members
of
or
have
a
contract
with
a
labor
organization.
surely
then,
this
is
arguably
protected
and
the
only
answer
or
the
only
question
really
with
respect
to
does
it
retain
its
arguably
protective
character
is
does
it
make
a
difference
whether
the
picketing
is
conducted
on
the
open
but
private
property
of
the
person
with
whom
you
had
your
dispute.
now,
the
board
day
in
and
day
out
resolves
clashes
between
a
worker's
claim
that
his
concerted
activity
is
protected
and
an
employer's
claim
that
it
unduly
interferes
with
his
property
rights.
so
this
kind
of
a
clash
is
part
of
the
board's
administrative
routine,
the
handling
of
it.
i
think
i
need
go
no
further
than
the
marshall
field
case.
as
you
all
--
as
the
court
of
courts
knows,
marshall
field
operates
a
big
department
store
in
chicago.
now,
its
building
is
bisected
by
a
private
street.
it
owns
that
street.
but
the
customers
use
the
street
and
the
employees
use
the
street.
and
the
board
said
that
street
must
be
open
to
union
solicitation
on
nonworking
time
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
enforce
that
order
saying
while
privately
owned,
this
street
partakes
of
the
nature
of
a
city
street
or
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
bernard
dunau
only
one
would
draw
distinction
between
placarding
and
talking
or
distributing
literature
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
in
this
case
and
so
far
as
the
activity
conducted
which
was
the
object
of
the
injunction,
it
was
picketing.
i
cannot
now
say
that
the
board
has
had
a
case
which
involved
picketing
as
such
but
which
from
our
point
of
view
certainly
say
breaches
the
result,
it
is
the
board's
business
to
say
whether
solicitation
is
different
from
picketing,
whether
different
rules
should
apply
and
what
should
be
done
with
it.
whether
the
answer
goes
one
way
or
the
other,
the
idea
of
preemption
is
that
the
board
should
give
the
first
answer
to
the
question
and
not
a
court
--
and
not
a
state
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
this
particular
picketing
and
so
far
as
the
record
discloses,
what
it
was
aimed
at
was
to
reach
the
customers
to
persuade
them
not
to
buy
but
in
terms
of
reaching
the
customers
to
persuade
them
not
to
buy,
you
have
the
same
need
of
getting
as
close
to
the
place
where
they
shop
as
you
can,
and
for
the
board,
you
would
then
have
the
same
sort
of
question
in
terms
of
exercising
your
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection
should
be
allowed
to
get
up
to
the
premises
of
the
store
and
to
that
degree,
modify
the
employer's
pure
property
right
saying
his
title
to
his
property
entitles
into
exclude
everybody.
now
the
board
has
in
this
area,
day
in
and
day
out.
it
meets
these
questions
as
to
whether
time
study
engineers
for
example
of
the
unions
can
come
in
to
a
plant.
a
union
organizes
and
get
on
to
a
vessel,
may
they
get
into
a
resort
or
hotel.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
have
been
unable
to
find
a
case
certainly
which
deals
with
peaceful
picketing
on
a
shopping
center.
mr.
bernard
dunau
on
a
shopping
center
as
such.
the
only
case
of
which
i
know
does
not
turn
on
the
question
of
the
arguably
protected
activity.
we
do
have
a
case
which
we
treat
quite
extensively
in
or
brief
in
which
we
point
out
what
happens
in
terms
of
the
--
multiplying
the
risk
of
committing
a
secondary
boycott
when
instead
of
allowing
the
picketing
to
take
place
at
the
premises
of
the
store
within
the
shopping
center,
you
require
that
it
take
place
at
the
perimeter
of
the
shopping
center
with
the
necessary
result
that
in
that
instance
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
no
matter
how
circumscribe
your
picketing
is,
it
reaches
employees
with
whom
you
do
not
have
a
dispute.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i'm
told
it
was
at
the
stores
but
i
have
no
recollection
of
the
specific
facts
at
the
moment,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
one
that
had
a
case
which
confronts
it
precisely
with
this
kind
of
a
problem.
now,
i
was
making
the
point
with
respect
to
secondary
boycotts
because
it
has
have
that
kind
of
a
case
where
the
picketing
is
conducted
for
example
in
one
case
because
the
police
say,
you
cannot
come
in
to
the
shopping
center.
so
per
force,
the
union
has
to
stay
outside
and
then
the
union
gets
involved
in
the
risks
of
circumscribing
its
picketing
so
as
to
confine
its
impact
as
much
as
possible
to
the
employer
within
the
shopping
center
with
whom
it
has
its
dispute
and
not
to
touch
other
employers
with
whom
it
does
not
have
this
dispute.
it
multiplies
risk
for
the
unions
because
no
matter
how
circumspect
you
are,
you
sometimes
even
unwittingly
cross
the
lines
and
you
get
yourself
involved
in
a
secondary
boycott
violation.
it
involves
risk
for
the
other
employers
within
the
shopping
center
because
no
matter
how
circumscribed
and
proper
your
activity
is
at
the
perimeter,
some
overflow,
there
necessarily
has
to
be
to
other
employers.
the
consequence
is
that,
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
where
you
keep
the
picketing
outside
the
shopping
center,
you
are
reaching
many
more
employers
than
you
have
any
reason
or
any
desire
to
reach.
it
creates
secondary
situations.
if
you
allow
the
picketing
to
be
where
it
should
in
our
view
be
in
front
of
the
store
with
whom
the
union
has
its
dispute
or
your
secondary
boycott
complications
fall
out.
in
our
view
therefore,
the
rule
adopted
by
the
court
below
upsets
the
secondary
and
primary
adjustment
which
underlies
the
scheme
here.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
none
of
our
argument
whether
it
goes
to
preemption
or
first
amendment
touches
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
the
number
of
people
to
allow
unimpeded
access.
all
we
are
asking
for
is
a
place
in
reasonable
numbers
in
front
of
the
premises
of
the
store
at
which
to
picket.
we
concede
the
power
of
the
state
whether
the
picketing
is
otherwise
preempted
or
otherwise
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
we
concede
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
the
number
and
the
places.
what
we
do
not
concede
and
what
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
can
you
throw
us
out
of
the
shopping
center
all
together.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
would
say
there
is
preemption
with
respect
to
the
question
whether
the
picketing
can
be
wholly
ousted
from
the
shopping
center.
we
do
not
say
that
there
is
preemption
with
respect
to
whether
picketing
in
front
of
the
premises
maybe
regulated.
we
make
no
such
claims.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
now,
i
think
perhaps
i
can
clarify
that
by
just
looking
at
the
injunction
that
was
entered
and
that
appears
in
several
places
but
pages
2
to
3.
what
we
are
after
in
this
case
of
the
record
is
that
part
of
the
injunction
a
and
b
which
prohibits
blatantly
picketing
and
trespassing
upon
the
private
property
of
plaintiff
weis
markets
and
picketing
and
trespassing
upon
the
private
property
of
plaintiff
logan
valley
plaza.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
are
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
perhaps
that
is
what
it
comes
down
to
because
if
the
record
were
to
support
c,
d,
e
and
f
of
the
injunction
which
is
related
to
obstructive
picketing,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
power
of
the
state
to
enter
c,
d,
e
and
f
and
if
our
quarrel
is
with
the
power
of
the
state
enter
a
and
b
and
why
we
brought
this
case
here
is
to
challenge
the
power
of
the
court
to
enter
a
and
b.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
a
complete
blanket.
now,
if
we
would
have
no
quarrel
with
the
injunction
which
says,
you
may
picket
at
the
premises
in
front
of
the
supermarket
so
long
as
you
do
not
let
us
say
picket
with
more
than
two
or
four
pickets
at
a
new
station
there
at
certain
spots
on
the
sidewalk.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
kind
of
an
injunction.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
don't
want
to
picket
on
the
rest
of
the
parking
lot.
that
is
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
this
--
all
we
want
is
an
opportunity
to
picket
in
front
of
the
supermarket.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
don't
want
to
be
at
the
entrance
of
the
parking
lot.
in
fact,
if
we
were
allowed
to
be
in
front
of
the
premises
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
was
about
to
say,
your
honor,
if
we
were
allowed
to
be
in
front
of
the
premises
of
the
store
within
the
shopping
center,
if
we
then
picketed
at
the
entrances
to
the
shopping
center,
we
would
be
engaging
in
a
secondary
boycott
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
of
the
act,
we
would
be
prohibited
from
doing
that.
the
only
reason
we're
allowed
to
be
there
at
all
is
because
we're
told
you
have
to
be
there
and
there's
no
other
place
to
picket
so
that
we
--
all
of
this
case
comes
down
to
as
can
we
picket
peacefully
in
front
of
the
premises
of
the
supermarket.
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
we
present
today
here
is
the
identical
case
that
was
presented
before
the
court
of
common
pleas.
these
briefs
before
the
court
of
common
pleas
are
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
in
that
court,
what
respondent
sought
they
said,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
court
has
asked
to
prohibit
defendant
from
picketing
rather
the
plaintiffs
request
that
the
court
control
its
location
by
directing
that
the
picketing
take
place
on
the
berm
of
the
public
thoroughfare
and
at
the
conclusion
of
its
brief
in
the
court
of
common
pleas.
the
berms
of
the
public
thoroughfares
provide
a
more
than
adequate
area
from
which
the
defendant
can
picket
and
or
distribute
handbills.
they
wanted
us
off
the
shopping
center.
now,
this
is
what
we
said
in
our
brief
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
at
page
8.
picketing
should
be
allowed
to
continue
near
the
weis
market
store
area
and
the
picket
should
not
be
restrained
to
picket
only
at
the
shopping
center
entrances.
the
defendant
union
would
be
willing
to
negotiate
with
plaintiff
weis
markets
as
to
the
number
of
pickets
to
be
utilized
and
the
manner
of
such
picketing
near
the
weis
market
store
area.
