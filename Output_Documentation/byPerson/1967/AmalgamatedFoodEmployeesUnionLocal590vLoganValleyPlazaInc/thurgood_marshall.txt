justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
sometimes
involved
in
that,
weren't
they
14
in
one
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
does
this
prohibit
picketing
on
the
berm
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
prohibit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
--
well,
is
the
berm
owned
by
logan
valley?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
according
to
your
court,
it
said
you
cannot
have
13
pickets
in
that
area
doing
what
they're
doing
rather
than
the
sweeping
language
have
used.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
in
effect,
--
i
well,
they
restricted
the
number
in
front
of
that
building
to
zero.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
restricting,
wouldn't
you
agree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
said,
get
out
of
that
area.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
get
off
of
all
of
the
private
property
owned
by
this
company.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
they
--
but
you
agree
that
they
could
have
limited
the
picketing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
said
don't
obstruct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you're
talking
about
what
we
have
before
you
is
not
the
only
thing
that
we
have
before
us,
this
broad
sweeping
language
in
this
order.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
need
be
in
violation
of
this
injunction,
the
one
picket?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
couldn't
do
it,
could
he?
the
union
couldn't
put
one
picket
there
for
15
minutes
a
day
without
violating
this
injunction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
of
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
what
we
have
before
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
solely
because
it's
privately
owned
street.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'll
wait
with
great
interest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lewis,
does
the
record
show
how
many
times
they
had
13?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lewis
on
that
point
on
page
106,
your
court
said,
these
pickets
even
though
engaged
in
picketing
of
a
peaceful
nature
had
no
right
or
authority
whatsoever
to
utilize
a
private
property
of
weis
and
of
logan
for
such
picketing
purposes.
such
use
constituted
in
a
trespass
which
was
improperly
was
restrained.
is
that
a
noble
opinion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
just
about
all
the
court
have
that
solely
becuase
it
was
private
property,
you
could
not
have
peaceful
picketing
in
any
place
on
private
property
under
any
circumstances
any
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
has
been
in
the
first
amendment
one,
marsh
against
alabama
which
you
gave
just
three
lines
in
a
footnote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
marsh
did
say
that
first
amendment
rights
could
exist
on
?private
property?.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
your
court
would
have
moved
differently
if
they've
been
handed
out
hand
bills
instead
of
carrying
a
sign.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
one.
i
said
handbillers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
handing
handbills
and
carrying
picket
signs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
be
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
sometimes
involved
in
that,
weren't
they
14
in
one
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
does
this
prohibit
picketing
on
the
berm
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
prohibit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
--
well,
is
the
berm
owned
by
logan
valley?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
according
to
your
court,
it
said
you
cannot
have
13
pickets
in
that
area
doing
what
they're
doing
rather
than
the
sweeping
language
have
used.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
in
effect,
--
i
well,
they
restricted
the
number
in
front
of
that
building
to
zero.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
restricting,
wouldn't
you
agree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
said,
get
out
of
that
area.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
get
off
of
all
of
the
private
property
owned
by
this
company.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
they
--
but
you
agree
that
they
could
have
limited
the
picketing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
said
don't
obstruct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
didn't.
justice
thurgood

so

that's

justice
thurgood

mr.
