mr.
robert
lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
this
court.
the
respondent,
logan
valley
plaza
is
a
shopping
plaza
as
you
know.
the
respondent
weis
market
is
a
small
supermarket
chain
of
60
stores
located
mostly
within
pennsylvania.
in
1965,
weis
owned
land
on
which
it
constructed
a
store.
subsequently;
it
sold
the
land
around
it
to
logan
valley
which
then
developed
a
shopping
center.
the
issue
before
this
court
as
we
see
it
is
whether
a
retailer
who
builds
his
own
store
on
his
own
land
must
also
provide
a
place
for
his
competitors,
employees
to
picket
stated
in
other
way
under
the
facts
of
this
case
should
a
state
court
be
prohibited
from
reasonable
regulation
of
picketing
which
takes
place
within
a
shopping
center
during
the
colluquy
with
mr.
dunau.
mr.
robert
lewis
well,
i'm
saying
that
the
question
is
whether
there
should
be
reasonable
regulation,
i
submit
sir
that
that's
what
was
done
here.
mr.
robert
lewis
in
this
instance
your
honor,
this
was
not
a
total
prohibition.
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
right.
at
four
entrances
of
the
shopping
center.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
it
was.
it
was
on
the
berm.
mr.
robert
lewis
oh
no.
that
picketing
was
sought
by
us.
we
requested
that
the
court
permit
picketing
to
take
place
on
the
berm
at
each
of
the
four
entrances
to
the
shopping
center
and
as
a
result,
the
union
continued
to
picket
there
for
18
months
--
mr.
robert
lewis
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
don't
like
to
put
it
that
i
concede
anything
your
honor
but
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
i
know
your
honor.
i
don't
feel
that
that's
the
total
answer
to
this
problem.
mr.
robert
lewis
under
certain
circumstances,
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
do
not
take
that
position.
and
at
times,
i
might
say,
i
felt
that
i
was
arguing
on
the
same
side
as
mr.
dunau
or
vice
versa.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
right
as
you
put
it
sir
--
exactly
without
any
qualification.
mr.
robert
lewis
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
if
you
will
--
mr.
robert
lewis
no
--
mr.
robert
lewis
it
said
that.
you
read
it
correctly
and
this
was
private
property.
if
i
may
respond
your
honor,
the
complaint,
as
we
drew
it
sought
to
permit
picketing
on
the
berms
if
i
may
just
look
at
it
in
a
moment.
i
will
call
your
attention
to
the
paragraph.
mr.
robert
lewis
thank
you.
well,
it's
in
the
complaint
i
believe.
mr.
robert
lewis
yeah,
i
think
its
page
10
of
the
appendix,
paragraph
13.
upon
information
of
belief,
the
plaintiff's
revert
that
the
defendants
intend
to
continue
with
illegal
trespassing
notwithstanding
that
well
developed
berms
on
public
surface
available
on
two
sides
of
plaintiff's
premises
which
maybe
used
by
the
said
defense
for
a
reasonable
and
lawful
picketing,
so
we
sought
and
we
asked
the
court
and
that's
on
page
10
of
the
appendix.
mr.
robert
lewis
oh,
the
appendix
of
this
case
--
i
mean
the
record.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
prohibit
or
forbid
on
that.
mr.
robert
lewis
picketing
on
a
berm?
no
sir,
in
no
respect.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
believe
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
berm
is
part
of
the
--
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
i
responded
to
you
and
then
as
i
read
this
complaint
in
paragraph
13,
i
notice
that
it
says,
private
--
mr.
robert
lewis
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
lewis
okay,
if
that's
the
way
the
question
was
raised
before
to
me,
you're
right.
i
didn't
catch
the
significance
of
the
terms
private
property.
i
thought
it
was
a
total
prohibition
of
picketing
and
this
is
not
a
total
prohibition
of
picketing.
we
specifically
requested
that
the
picketing
be
continued.
mr.
robert
lewis
no.
i
think
you
framed
--
if
i
may
sir.
you
framed
the
question
before
that
i
would
--
mr.
robert
lewis
they're
adjacent
to
the
private
property.
mr.
robert
lewis
no.
well,
i
would
say
they're
probably
on
the
other
side
of
the
property
line.
it's
a
question
how
we
frame
the
complaint.
mr.
robert
lewis
eighty
three.
that's
a
berm
and
--
mr.
robert
lewis
yeah.
well
--
mr.
robert
lewis
the
berm
as
you
see
it
is
right
end
side.
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
we
alleged
it
to
be
a
public
property.
i
do
not
in
fact
--
no.
i
don't
feel
that
that
is
significant
in
our
discussions.
the
point
of
it
is
we
did
request
the
picketing
to
go
there.
it
measures
12
to
15
feet.
the
picketing
took
place
there
and
continued
there
for
18
months
after
the
injunction,
the
two
pickets
at
each
of
the
entrances,
eight
pickets
in
total.
mr.
robert
lewis
our
position
--
mr.
robert
lewis
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
lewis
meaning
that
the
lower
court
is
affirmed
by
the
state
court
of
pennsylvania
was
correct
in
enjoining
all
picketing,
in
view
of
what
happened.
now,
today,
it's
very
significant
to
deal
with
the
facts
of
course
and
today,
i
heard
mr.
dunau
stating
that
they
would
have
no
objection
to
picketing
on
the
porch.
if
the
court
only
restricted
picketing
to
that
little
area,
they
have
no
objection
to
this
but
that
wasn't
before
the
court
when
i
was
there
trying
this
case.
there's
a
question
of
insisting
that
they
have
the
right
to
have
13
pickets
in
that
puzzled
pickup
zone
doing
what
they
were
doing.
that
was
the
issue.
now
the
issue
may
have
changed.
mr.
robert
lewis
the
court
could
have
said,
we
will
restrict
the
number
of
picketing,
and
the
court
could
have
said
we
will
restrict
the
place.
mr.
robert
lewis
the
court
in
effect
did
this
your
honor.
they
restricted
the
place.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
i
would
agree.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
what
they
said
in
view
of
what
took
place
and
in
view
of
the
union's
position.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
they
could
have.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
except
--
yes
sir.
except
that
i
don't
consider
broad
sweeping.broad
sweeping
language
as
used
by
this
court
is
total
prohibition
of
picketing
--
in
total.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
picketing
was
permitted
to
be
continued.
i
see
a
definite
distinction.
if
the
purpose
of
picketing
is
to
communicate
with
the
public
and
that
was
the
avowed
purpose
here
and
if
the
lower
court
so
expressed
itself
in
terms
of
the
injunction
to
permit
that
attempt
to
communicate
to
continue,
that's
not
prohibition.
i
like
to
call
your
court
--
your
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
now,
if
i
may
respond
to
you,
the
previous
question
has
two
parts.
you
spoke
about
the
complaint
in
our
allegation
of
private
property.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
surely
we
alleged
this
question.
we
also
alleged
obstruction
and
interference
with
all
operations.
that's
a
significant
factor
your
honor
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
i
don't
see
any
problem
doing
that.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
i
have
to
defend
that.
now,
i
think
it's
defensible
under
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
lewis
alright,
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
in
a
moment
to
the
diagram
which
appears
in
our
brief
at
page
5
which
mr.
dunau
characterizes
as
a
pretty
good
representation.
i
think
it
might
help
us,
it's
that
law,
it
follows
page
4
and
it's
a
pull
out.
now,
as
i
understand
the
--
mr.
dunau's
argument
today,
he
would
take
as
an
alternative
area
to
the
puzzled
pickup
zone,
picketing
on
the
sidewalk
as
he
terms
it
or
as
porch
which
we
consider
it
to
be.
now,
if
you
would
just
consider
this
position
in
a
moment,
i'm
sure
you'll
see
that
it's
an
unreasonable
one
if
you
were
to
move
those
13
pickets
to
the
corner
of
the
store,
what
kind
of
obstruction
you
would
have.
i
might
say
to
help
the
court
there's
a
tree
in
the
picture
and
immediately
to
the
left
of
the
tree
is
the
entrance
to
the
store.
there
are
three
posts
and
then
comes
the
entrance.
it's
in
the
corner
--
the
right
hand
corner
of
the
store.
can
you
imagine
13
pickets
standing
on
that
sidewalk
--
mr.
robert
lewis
oh,
i
misunderstood
him.
i
see.
i
think
that's
possibly
so
in
view
of
--
he
brought
this
up
in
two
different
points.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
think
that's
probably
so
and
i
might
say
your
honor
that
if
there's
just
one
picket
standing
there,
not
obstructing
anybody
in
anyway,
we
feel
that
that's
a
significant
consideration
that
the
state
court
should
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
issue
an
injunction
here.
one
picket
by
himself
can
communicate
and
if
he
doesn't
interfere
with
traffic
and
if
he
doesn't
interfere
with
the
customers,
that's
not
such
a
serious
consideration.
mr.
robert
lewis
oh
surely
at
this
point
--
mr.
robert
lewis
no,
but
they
could
have
asked
the
court
for
a
permission
to
do
that.
i
agree.
mr.
robert
lewis
as
it's
now.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
we'll
stick
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor
and
i'll
rest
my
case
on
these
facts.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
think
there's
more
to
it
your
honor
and
i
hope
to
develop
that.
mr.
robert
lewis
in
fact,
i
would
like
to
underscore
certain
facts
appearing
in
this
case
which
are
not
denied.
there
were
13
pickets.
they
did
picket
for
abreast.
this
picketing
took
place
at
the
point
where
customers
entered
with
their
cars
and
were
weis
employees
worked,
thus
employees,
customers,
pickets
and
cars
intermingled
resulting
in
confusion
and
congestion
and
that's
a
fact
and
it's
in
the
record.
this
is
considered
by
the
court.
now,
the
avowed
purpose
of
the
picketing
was
to
inform
the
public
that
weis
employees
were
not
members
of
the
picketing
union.
the
trial
court
after
a
full
hearing
continued
a
preliminary
injunction
and
permitted
these
pickets
to
continue
out
on
the
berm.
i
might
just
call
your
attention
to
page
102
of
the
record
where
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
noted
this
question
that
you
were
asking
me
a
while
ago
concerning
the
effect
of
this
injunction
in
footnote
4,
the
court
points
out
that
the
practical
effect
was
to
restrict
picketing
to
the
berm
areas.
i
mean
this
doesn't
add
anything
to
our
colloquy.
i
just
thought
i
call
your
attention
to
it.
now,
as
a
result
of
this
picketing
out
on
the
berm
areas
and
i
might
say
your
honors
that
the
berm
areas
as
you
can
see
from
the
picture,
was
a
leveled
area.
it
was
easy
to
picket
on
there.
it
was
wide
and
there
was
no
danger
to
the
pickets
and
so
the
court
found.
and
as
a
result,
not
a
single
person
entering
the
shopping
center
could
be
unaware
of
the
union's
message,
the
trial
court
so
found.
the
union
argues
initially
that
the
state
court
had
no
power
to
regulate
the
picketing
because
it
infringes
on
freedom
of
speech.
but
as
your
honors
have
said,
picketing
is
more
than
speech.
picketing
is
conduct
and
that's
the
problem.
it's
the
conduct
of
the
picketing
here.
the
13
pickets
marching
for
abreast,
interfering
with
traffic
and
customers
which
gave
occasion
to
the
regulation
among
other
factors,
it
was
the
presence
of
the
pickets
marching
up
and
down
which
led
this
court
to
its
conclusion.
the
congestion,
the
hindrance
of
customers
and
the
disruption
of
normal
business,
these
were
the
considerations
which
resulted
in
a
reasonable
regulation
with
which
we
are
involved.
now,
the
union
says
that
all
at
once
is
to
communicate.
if
this
is
so,
why
would
13
pickets
necessary.
wouldn't
one
picket
with
some
wood
signs
on
front
and
back
have
been
sufficient.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
one
afternoon
and
one
evening.
mr.
robert
lewis
which
caused
us
to
immediately
go
into
court.
we
didn't
want
to
wait
much
longer.
we
then
reached
the
crux
of
the
matter.
the
union
claims
freedom
of
speech.
the
state
claims
a
duty
to
regulate
on
behalf
of
its
citizens.
the
state
strikes
a
balance.
the
question
is
should
this
court
disturb
the
balance
struck.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
in
the
past
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
correct
and
we
would
never
have
sought
an
injunction.
mr.
robert
lewis
your
honors,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
be
satisfied
only
within
the
premise
of
the
state
court
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
have
argued
in
response
to
colloquy
in
questions
as
to
what
i
consider
proper
picketing
of
reasonable
regulation
but
i
submit
your
honor
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
either
this
court
should
affirm
the
state
court's
actions
here
in
view
of
what
took
place.
i'm
not
saying
that
in
another
case,
the
state
could
or
act
differently.
i'm
saying
that
a
state
should
be
left
to
make
this
determination
providing,
it
doesn't
prohibit
picketing
entirely.
have
i
made
myself
clear?
mr.
robert
lewis
well,
i'll
try
it
again.
mr.
robert
lewis
there
is
no
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
your
honor.
you
put
it
very
well.
mr.
robert
lewis
no
sir.
the
conduct
enjoined
here
was
primary
picketing.
mr.
robert
lewis
not
at
least
and
i
think
the
best
evidence
is
that
for
the
18
months
that
they
were
picketing
out
there,
nobody
said
a
word
including
my
client,
logan
valley.
now,
in
the
past,
this
court
--
this
court
has
been
reluctant
to
disturb
state
court's
injunctions
in
this
area
except
of
course
where
there
is
total
coefficient
of
picketing.
this
court
stated
that
a
state
court's
judgment
is
entitled
to
a
waiting
title
of
respect.
it
is
true
that
other
states
have
balanced
differently.
for
example,
california's
public
policy
is
set
forth
by
a
specific
exclusion
from
its
trespass
statute.
as
a
result,
california's
public
policy
therefore
is
to
permit
labor
union
picketing
within
a
shopping
center.
pennsylvania
in
a
factual
matrix
of
this
case,
through
its
judiciary
declares
conversely
by
affirming
pennsylvania,
this
court
does
not
upset
california's
public
policy.
these
differences
of
public
policy
illustrate
as
this
court
has
recognized
that
states
have
different
social
and
economic
views
and
that
each
state
must
be
free
to
determine
its
own
views
on
this
matter.
of
course,
the
injunction
here
as
we
see
it
was
a
narrow
one
and
not
enjoining
all
picketing.
it
merely
regulated
the
picketing
to
a
particular
place.
thus,
i
submit,
it
accommodated
all
interest,
the
union's
interest
in
communication
with
potential
customers
was
preserved
as
they
continue
to
picket
at
the
berms,
right
at
the
point
where
the
customers
entered,
weis'
property
rights,
whatever
they
were,
were
preserved.
the
public's
right
to
trade
without
interference
was
maintained
and
the
states
right
to
maintain
domestic
peace
was
preserved.
it
is
submitted
that
this
was
a
reasonable
and
proper
balance.
but
the
union
now
argues
that
pennsylvania
was
preempted.
from
arriving
at
this
reasonable
accommodation,
although
we
have
argued
this
question
in
our
brief,
we
submit
that
this
court
need
not
reach
it.
i
might
add
that
although
the
term
sidewalk
has
been
used
here
today
and
all
other
courts
in
this
case
have
used
the
term
porch,
this
is
in
fact
a
noncontiguous
sidewalk.
when
the
case
arose,
it
was
just
this
one
store
with
sears
off
to
the
side
and
a
lot
of
construction
going
on.
this
is
not
the
type
of
sidewalk
that
one
visualizes
either
on
a
public
thoroughfare
or
within
a
possible
shopping
center.
this
court
--
this
porch
didn't
go
anywhere.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
waiver,
we
submit
that
preemption
is
a
claim
of
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
this
court
has
refused
to
entertain
such
a
claim
unless
first
presented
to
the
highest
state
court.
the
law
of
pennsylvania
is
that
it
will
not
consider
a
question
not
presented
to
it
according
to
its
rules.
the
question
framed
by
the
union
for
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
was,
did
the
lower
court
err.
there
was
no
reference
to
preemption
or
the
supremacy
clause
in
the
question
framed.
there
was
no
reference
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
or
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
union's
brief
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
argues
reversal
and
gives
reasons
but
preemption
was
not
one
of
them.
mr.
robert
lewis
where
were
those
objections?
mr.
robert
lewis
it
wasn't
there.
they
never
made
it.
oh,
let
me
refer
you
to
the
union's
question
framed.
mr.
robert
lewis
i'm
sorry,
yes.
that
brief
is
before
this
court,
it's
been
lodged
by
us.
we've
lodged
i
think
ten
copies
with
the
clerk's
office.
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
have
it.
at
any
rate,
you'll
find
--
if
you
do
have
it
before
you
--
it's
this
color,
if
this
helps
and
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
brief
for
appellants
and
statement
of
question
involved
is
on
page
2.
this
is
the
brief
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
on
page
2,
they
frame
their
question
and
that's
what
i'm
referring
to.
mr.
robert
lewis
shall
i
read
it?
mr.
robert
lewis
yeah
--
well,
not
too
long.
did
the
lower
court
err
in
granting
a
preliminary
injunction
without
hearing
and
thereafter
denying
and
dismissing
appellant's
motion
to
dissolve
or
modify
said
injunction
and
further
continuing
said
preliminary
injunction
where
in
a
suit
in
equity
by
the
owner
of
a
shopping
center
in
one
of
its
tenants,
it
is
established
that
appellant
union
peacefully
picketed
near
the
tenant's
building
within
the
confines
of
said
shopping
center
that
no
picketing
efforts
were
directed
towards
the
shopping
center
or
other
tenants
that
picketing
efforts
were
merely
to
inform
the
public
of
the
labor
dispute,
negative
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
granting
and
continuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
which
we
strain
appellant
union
from
picketing
within
the
entire
limits
of
a
shopping
center
area.
that's
the
total
question.
mr.
robert
lewis
you'll
not
find
it.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes
sir.
now
we
argued
in
our
brief
that
the
union
has
waived
this
defense.
the
union
argued
against
this
contention.
we
submit
that
a
claim
of
preemption
is
a
claim
of
violation
of
the
supremacy
and
commerce
clause
and
that
this
court
has
held
in
cases
cited
by
us
at
page
29
of
our
brief
that
such
a
claim
must
be
made
to
the
highest
state
court
and
the
union
hasn't
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right,
sua
sponte
and
to
the
extent
that
he
--
to
the
limit
of
the
extent
that
he
did.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
by
the
way
of
motion
which
is
in
the
appendix.
i
submit
in
the
appendix
at
page
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
not
sufficiently
under
the
court's
rules.
the
pennsylvania
court's
rules,
it
must
be
in
the
question
presented
and
it
must
be
argued
in
the
brief.
mr.
robert
lewis
rule
59,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
lewis
well,
i
pointed
in
my
brief
your
honor.
i'll
call
your
attention
to
it.
mr.
robert
lewis
page
30,
thank
you.
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
submit
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
it
must
be
raised
and
that
this
court
is
held
that
claims
of
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause,
equal
protection,
due
process
clause
our
waive
unless
it
were
raised
before
the
higher
state
court.
the
cases
that
i
cite
on
page
29
of
our
brief.
mr.
robert
lewis
this
one,
cio
versus
mcadory.
now
the
other
cases
are
supremacy
clause
cases
and
if
preemption
is
a
claim
of
violation
to
the
supremacy
clause
--
mr.
robert
lewis
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
versus
the
labor
board?
mr.
robert
lewis
just
that
one.
mr.
robert
lewis
cio
versus
mcadory.
it's
on
page
32.
well,
if
this
court
disagrees
however
with
this
position
and
consideration,
and
i
believe
that
this
question
of
preemption
should
be
decided
nevertheless
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
is
no
preemption.
initially,
we
submit
that
the
case
is
not
arguably
subject
to
the
act.
furthermore,
we
contend
that
even
if
the
matter
in
issue
were
arguably
subject,
there
is
--
excuse
me.
there
is
no
preemption
because
of
pennsylvania's
deeply
rooted
interest
in
protecting
the
privacy,
the
property
and
the
peace
of
its
citizens.
we
turn
first
to
the
two
sections
cited
by
the
union
in
support
of
its
claim
that
unfair
labor
practices
were
arguably
involved.
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
awhile
ago
concerning
secondary
activity,
i
responded
that
it's
the
conduct
enjoined
and
not
the
conduct
permitted
which
is
crucial
in
determining
where
the
activities
are
arguably
subject
to
the
act
and
i
responded
that
nobody
made
any
complaint.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
lewis
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
follow
you.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
this
injunction
--
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
following
your
thesis
your
honor
but
maybe
i
can
answer
it
in
this
way.
the
--
there
are
two
sections
cited
--
you
want
to
simplify
it?
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
well,
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
lewis
alright.
i
think
you
have
to
analyze
the
section.
the
section
8
(b)
(7)
deals
with
picketing
for
the
purposes
of
organizational
purposes
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
a
contract,
recognition
purposes.
if
neither
was
done
here
and
it's
considered
that
neither
was
done
here,
there
is
no
violation
of
8
(b)
(7)
and
there
is
no
violation
of
any
section
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
mr.
robert
lewis
okay,
now
on
the
question
of
section
7,
mr.
justice
white
pursued
that
with
mr.
dunau
and
i'll
be
frank
to
acknowledge
that
when
this
court
handed
down
its
garmon
decision
concerning
protected
activity,
i
was
somewhat
at
a
loss.
i
wondered
as
mr.
justice
white
apparently
wondered
how
one
could
get
a
determination
from
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
the
matter
is
protected
activity
certainly
if
the
union
did
not
file
a
charge
and
no
charge
is
filed
here,
there
is
no
determination
against
myself.
mr.
robert
lewis
and
what
would
i
allege?
mr.
robert
lewis
these
are
all
well
defined.
i
wouldn't
file
a
charge
that
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right
and
i
would
be
in
a
loss
to
know
what
to
allege.
mr.
robert
lewis
no,
because
there
was
no
effort
to
influence
employees
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
no,
because
when
the
board
turns
down
the
charge
--
mr.
robert
lewis
i
disagree.
i
filed
many
charges
and
i've
had
many
even
turned
down
and
the
board
uses
a
stock
phrase
that
it
does
not
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
issue
a
complaint.
there
are
many
reasons
why
the
board
turns
down
the
charge
and
they
don't
tell
you.
they're
not
required
to.
but
there's
more
as
far
as
this
protected
question
and
when
if
i
may
finish
responding
to
you
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
advised
this
court
that
picketing
within
the
store
is
not
protected
activity
and
i
think
this
bears
on
the
question
that
you're
asking.
mr.
robert
lewis
alright,
yes
he
did.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
correct
and
in
view
of
that,
it's
certainly
now
considered
by
all
parties
that
there
are
--
all
situations
of
peaceful
picketing
which
is
not
protected.
our
position
in
fact
is
that
the
picket's
interference
with
the
merchandising
operations
just
outside
the
door
is
as
much
a
disruption
of
picketing
and
this
is
much
a
disruption
of
business
as
it
wouldn't
happen
if
the
picketing
took
place
within
the
store.
it
must
be
remembered
your
honors
that
our
merchandising
operation
continued
after
the
purchase
of
the
merchandise
have
continued
while
the
cars
were
driven
up
by
the
customers
and
the
customers
got
out
of
the
cars,
the
weis
employees
left
--
they
didn't
leave.
so
they
work
there.
they
work
out
on
the
puzzled
pick
up
zone
all
day
long
and
as
the
cars
drove
in,
the
customers
got
out,
the
employees
assisted
the
loading
of
the
merchandise.
well,
this
is
as
much
a
merchandising
operation
as
it
took
place
within
the
store
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
distinction.
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
even
if
the
matter
were
arguably
subject
to
the
act
and
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be,
the
state
was
not
preempted
because
the
regulated
conduct
touch
interest,
deeply
rooted
in
local
feeling
and
responsibility.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
has
expressed
this
as
follows
in
this
case,
this
commonwealth
has
a
duty
to
protect
and
preserve
the
property
of
its
citizens
from
invasion
by
way
of
trespass.
the
interest
of
the
state
is
deeply
rooted
because
of
its
responsibility
to
maintain
peace.
it
has
a
responsibility
to
prevent
possible
breaches
of
a
peace
which
are
likely
to
occur
as
a
result
of
unauthorized
entrance
upon
property
of
another.
the
function
of
trespass
actions
in
preventing
violence
has
been
long
recognized,
in
people
versus
peduto,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
succinctly
stated
that
trespass
can
lead
to
violence.
the
court
further
stated
that
when
a
person
refuses
to
leave
another's
property
after
he
has
been
ordered
to
do
so,
a
threat
of
violence
becomes
imminent
and
this
court
recently
reaffirmed
in
lynn
that
where
there
is
such
a
possibility
of
violence,
the
states
must
be
free
to
act.
mr.
robert
lewis
in
our
situation?
mr.
robert
lewis
not
by
explicit
findings.
mr.
robert
lewis
a
peace
--
that's
right.
it's
found
that
there
was
peaceful
picketing
and
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
there's
peaceful
picketing
today
does
not
mean
that
there's
not
a
threat
of
violence
or
violence
tomorrow.
i'd
like
to
call
your
court's
attention
--
your
honor's
attention
that
although
the
thrust
of
the
lower
court's
decisions
were
premised
on
trespass,
there's
more
to
this
case
than
that
as
the
fact
show.
mr.
robert
lewis
in
the
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
now,
you've
said
a
little
too
bluntly
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest.
i
would
agree
with
your
first
premise
that
that's
what
they
held.
but
they
held
it
in
the
factual
matrix
of
this
case,
they
said
it
in
the
opinion,
factual
matrix.
they
didn't
move.
mr.
robert
lewis
labor
picketing
--
uphold
labor
picketing
on
private
property?
mr.
robert
lewis
i'm
at
a
loss
your
honor.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
you
know
well
that
you
reserve
this
question
on
the
fairlawn
case.
and
this
is
the
first
time
since
then
that
the
question
has
been
put
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
lewis
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
robert
lewis
there
is
no
question
about
it.
in
handling
leafleting
situation
which
that
court
--
which
that
case
was
directed
to,
there
are
different
considerations.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
in
fact,
that
would
never
have
gone
in
for
the
injunction
if
there
is
only
one
handbill
standing
there.
mr.
robert
lewis
well,
if
there
were
13
handbillers
--
mr.
robert
lewis
obstruction.
first
of
all
--
may
i
respond?
i
don't
know
if
you
want
me
to
--
mr.
robert
lewis
okay.
i've
seen
it.
i'm
sure
as
you
have,
pickets
do
act
to
the
fact
that
they
are
physically
present.
it's
their
conduct,
it's
their
physical
presence
which
constitutes
a
consideration
in
this
court's
distinguishing
between
pure
speech
and
picketing.
now,
handbilling
although
a
person
naturally
has
to
hand
out
a
handbilling
--
a
handbill,
is
a
different
matter.
a
handbill
as
i
see
it
is
primarily
speech.
now,
nevertheless,
though
they're
handbilling
a
speech,
you
can
nevertheless
have
13
handbillings
which
would
constitute
--
handbillers
which
would
constitute
as
much
an
obstruction
as
with
13
pickets.
if
13
handbillers
stood
in
front
of
the
door
of
this
supermarket,
that
would
be
an
obstruction.
if
one
did,
that
would
not
be
and
that
would
never
gone
into
court
with
this
injunction.
we
conclude
as
we
began
13
pickets
did
march
at
least
one
day
for
abreast
and
it
seriously
disrupted
weis'
business.
a
threat
of
violence
was
imminent.
i
submit
your
honors,
i
was
there.
the
threat
was
there.
it
didn't
happen
we
move
quickly.
thus
--
mr.
robert
lewis
it
was
unnecessary
to
allege
it,
no.
i
don't
believe
we
did.
thus,
under
these
circumstances,
the
limited,
narrow
and
reasonable
regulation
of
the
picketing
by
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
should
not
be
disturbed.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
this
court.
the
respondent,
logan
valley
plaza
is
a
shopping
plaza
as
you
know.
the
respondent
weis
market
is
a
small
supermarket
chain
of
60
stores
located
mostly
within
pennsylvania.
in
1965,
weis
owned
land
on
which
it
constructed
a
store.
subsequently;
it
sold
the
land
around
it
to
logan
valley
which
then
developed
a
shopping
center.
the
issue
before
this
court
as
we
see
it
is
whether
a
retailer
who
builds
his
own
store
on
his
own
land
must
also
provide
a
place
for
his
competitors,
employees
to
picket
stated
in
other
way
under
the
facts
of
this
case
should
a
state
court
be
prohibited
from
reasonable
regulation
of
picketing
which
takes
place
within
a
shopping
center
during
the
colluquy
with
mr.
dunau.
mr.
robert
lewis
well,
i'm
saying
that
the
question
is
whether
there
should
be
reasonable
regulation,
i
submit
sir
that
that's
what
was
done
here.
mr.
robert
lewis
in
this
instance
your
honor,
this
was
not
a
total
prohibition.
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
right.
at
four
entrances
of
the
shopping
center.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
it
was.
it
was
on
the
berm.
mr.
robert
lewis
oh
no.
that
picketing
was
sought
by
us.
we
requested
that
the
court
permit
picketing
to
take
place
on
the
berm
at
each
of
the
four
entrances
to
the
shopping
center
and
as
a
result,
the
union
continued
to
picket
there
for
18
months
--
mr.
robert
lewis
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
don't
like
to
put
it
that
i
concede
anything
your
honor
but
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
i
know
your
honor.
i
don't
feel
that
that's
the
total
answer
to
this
problem.
mr.
robert
lewis
under
certain
circumstances,
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
do
not
take
that
position.
and
at
times,
i
might
say,
i
felt
that
i
was
arguing
on
the
same
side
as
mr.
dunau
or
vice
versa.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
right
as
you
put
it
sir
--
exactly
without
any
qualification.
mr.
robert
lewis
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
if
you
will
--
mr.
robert
lewis
no
--
mr.
robert
lewis
it
said
that.
you
read
it
correctly
and
this
was
private
property.
if
i
may
respond
your
honor,
the
complaint,
as
we
drew
it
sought
to
permit
picketing
on
the
berms
if
i
may
just
look
at
it
in
a
moment.
i
will
call
your
attention
to
the
paragraph.
mr.
robert
lewis
thank
you.
well,
it's
in
the
complaint
i
believe.
mr.
robert
lewis
yeah,
i
think
its
page
10
of
the
appendix,
paragraph
13.
upon
information
of
belief,
the
plaintiff's
revert
that
the
defendants
intend
to
continue
with
illegal
trespassing
notwithstanding
that
well
developed
berms
on
public
surface
available
on
two
sides
of
plaintiff's
premises
which
maybe
used
by
the
said
defense
for
a
reasonable
and
lawful
picketing,
so
we
sought
and
we
asked
the
court
and
that's
on
page
10
of
the
appendix.
mr.
robert
lewis
oh,
the
appendix
of
this
case
--
i
mean
the
record.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
prohibit
or
forbid
on
that.
mr.
robert
lewis
picketing
on
a
berm?
no
sir,
in
no
respect.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
believe
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
berm
is
part
of
the
--
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
i
responded
to
you
and
then
as
i
read
this
complaint
in
paragraph
13,
i
notice
that
it
says,
private
--
mr.
robert
lewis
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
lewis
okay,
if
that's
the
way
the
question
was
raised
before
to
me,
you're
right.
i
didn't
catch
the
significance
of
the
terms
private
property.
i
thought
it
was
a
total
prohibition
of
picketing
and
this
is
not
a
total
prohibition
of
picketing.
we
specifically
requested
that
the
picketing
be
continued.
mr.
robert
lewis
no.
i
think
you
framed
--
if
i
may
sir.
you
framed
the
question
before
that
i
would
--
mr.
robert
lewis
they're
adjacent
to
the
private
property.
mr.
robert
lewis
no.
well,
i
would
say
they're
probably
on
the
other
side
of
the
property
line.
it's
a
question
how
we
frame
the
complaint.
mr.
robert
lewis
eighty
three.
that's
a
berm
and
--
mr.
robert
lewis
yeah.
well
--
mr.
robert
lewis
the
berm
as
you
see
it
is
right
end
side.
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
we
alleged
it
to
be
a
public
property.
i
do
not
in
fact
--
no.
i
don't
feel
that
that
is
significant
in
our
discussions.
the
point
of
it
is
we
did
request
the
picketing
to
go
there.
it
measures
12
to
15
feet.
the
picketing
took
place
there
and
continued
there
for
18
months
after
the
injunction,
the
two
pickets
at
each
of
the
entrances,
eight
pickets
in
total.
mr.
robert
lewis
our
position
--
mr.
robert
lewis
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
lewis
meaning
that
the
lower
court
is
affirmed
by
the
state
court
of
pennsylvania
was
correct
in
enjoining
all
picketing,
in
view
of
what
happened.
now,
today,
it's
very
significant
to
deal
with
the
facts
of
course
and
today,
i
heard
mr.
dunau
stating
that
they
would
have
no
objection
to
picketing
on
the
porch.
if
the
court
only
restricted
picketing
to
that
little
area,
they
have
no
objection
to
this
but
that
wasn't
before
the
court
when
i
was
there
trying
this
case.
there's
a
question
of
insisting
that
they
have
the
right
to
have
13
pickets
in
that
puzzled
pickup
zone
doing
what
they
were
doing.
that
was
the
issue.
now
the
issue
may
have
changed.
mr.
robert
lewis
the
court
could
have
said,
we
will
restrict
the
number
of
picketing,
and
the
court
could
have
said
we
will
restrict
the
place.
mr.
robert
lewis
the
court
in
effect
did
this
your
honor.
they
restricted
the
place.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
i
would
agree.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
what
they
said
in
view
of
what
took
place
and
in
view
of
the
union's
position.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
they
could
have.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
except
--
yes
sir.
except
that
i
don't
consider
broad
sweeping.broad
sweeping
language
as
used
by
this
court
is
total
prohibition
of
picketing
--
in
total.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
picketing
was
permitted
to
be
continued.
i
see
a
definite
distinction.
if
the
purpose
of
picketing
is
to
communicate
with
the
public
and
that
was
the
avowed
purpose
here
and
if
the
lower
court
so
expressed
itself
in
terms
of
the
injunction
to
permit
that
attempt
to
communicate
to
continue,
that's
not
prohibition.
i
like
to
call
your
court
--
your
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
now,
if
i
may
respond
to
you,
the
previous
question
has
two
parts.
you
spoke
about
the
complaint
in
our
allegation
of
private
property.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
surely
we
alleged
this
question.
we
also
alleged
obstruction
and
interference
with
all
operations.
that's
a
significant
factor
your
honor
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
i
don't
see
any
problem
doing
that.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
i
have
to
defend
that.
now,
i
think
it's
defensible
under
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
lewis
alright,
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
in
a
moment
to
the
diagram
which
appears
in
our
brief
at
page
5
which
mr.
dunau
characterizes
as
a
pretty
good
representation.
i
think
it
might
help
us,
it's
that
law,
it
follows
page
4
and
it's
a
pull
out.
now,
as
i
understand
the
--
mr.
dunau's
argument
today,
he
would
take
as
an
alternative
area
to
the
puzzled
pickup
zone,
picketing
on
the
sidewalk
as
he
terms
it
or
as
porch
which
we
consider
it
to
be.
now,
if
you
would
just
consider
this
position
in
a
moment,
i'm
sure
you'll
see
that
it's
an
unreasonable
one
if
you
were
to
move
those
13
pickets
to
the
corner
of
the
store,
what
kind
of
obstruction
you
would
have.
i
might
say
to
help
the
court
there's
a
tree
in
the
picture
and
immediately
to
the
left
of
the
tree
is
the
entrance
to
the
store.
there
are
three
posts
and
then
comes
the
entrance.
it's
in
the
corner
--
the
right
hand
corner
of
the
store.
can
you
imagine
13
pickets
standing
on
that
sidewalk
--
mr.
robert
lewis
oh,
i
misunderstood
him.
i
see.
i
think
that's
possibly
so
in
view
of
--
he
brought
this
up
in
two
different
points.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
think
that's
probably
so
and
i
might
say
your
honor
that
if
there's
just
one
picket
standing
there,
not
obstructing
anybody
in
anyway,
we
feel
that
that's
a
significant
consideration
that
the
state
court
should
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
issue
an
injunction
here.
one
picket
by
himself
can
communicate
and
if
he
doesn't
interfere
with
traffic
and
if
he
doesn't
interfere
with
the
customers,
that's
not
such
a
serious
consideration.
mr.
robert
lewis
oh
surely
at
this
point
--
mr.
robert
lewis
no,
but
they
could
have
asked
the
court
for
a
permission
to
do
that.
i
agree.
mr.
robert
lewis
as
it's
now.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
we'll
stick
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor
and
i'll
rest
my
case
on
these
facts.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
think
there's
more
to
it
your
honor
and
i
hope
to
develop
that.
mr.
robert
lewis
in
fact,
i
would
like
to
underscore
certain
facts
appearing
in
this
case
which
are
not
denied.
there
were
13
pickets.
they
did
picket
for
abreast.
this
picketing
took
place
at
the
point
where
customers
entered
with
their
cars
and
were
weis
employees
worked,
thus
employees,
customers,
pickets
and
cars
intermingled
resulting
in
confusion
and
congestion
and
that's
a
fact
and
it's
in
the
record.
this
is
considered
by
the
court.
now,
the
avowed
purpose
of
the
picketing
was
to
inform
the
public
that
weis
employees
were
not
members
of
the
picketing
union.
the
trial
court
after
a
full
hearing
continued
a
preliminary
injunction
and
permitted
these
pickets
to
continue
out
on
the
berm.
i
might
just
call
your
attention
to
page
102
of
the
record
where
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
noted
this
question
that
you
were
asking
me
a
while
ago
concerning
the
effect
of
this
injunction
in
footnote
4,
the
court
points
out
that
the
practical
effect
was
to
restrict
picketing
to
the
berm
areas.
i
mean
this
doesn't
add
anything
to
our
colloquy.
i
just
thought
i
call
your
attention
to
it.
now,
as
a
result
of
this
picketing
out
on
the
berm
areas
and
i
might
say
your
honors
that
the
berm
areas
as
you
can
see
from
the
picture,
was
a
leveled
area.
it
was
easy
to
picket
on
there.
it
was
wide
and
there
was
no
danger
to
the
pickets
and
so
the
court
found.
and
as
a
result,
not
a
single
person
entering
the
shopping
center
could
be
unaware
of
the
union's
message,
the
trial
court
so
found.
the
union
argues
initially
that
the
state
court
had
no
power
to
regulate
the
picketing
because
it
infringes
on
freedom
of
speech.
but
as
your
honors
have
said,
picketing
is
more
than
speech.
picketing
is
conduct
and
that's
the
problem.
it's
the
conduct
of
the
picketing
here.
the
13
pickets
marching
for
abreast,
interfering
with
traffic
and
customers
which
gave
occasion
to
the
regulation
among
other
factors,
it
was
the
presence
of
the
pickets
marching
up
and
down
which
led
this
court
to
its
conclusion.
the
congestion,
the
hindrance
of
customers
and
the
disruption
of
normal
business,
these
were
the
considerations
which
resulted
in
a
reasonable
regulation
with
which
we
are
involved.
now,
the
union
says
that
all
at
once
is
to
communicate.
if
this
is
so,
why
would
13
pickets
necessary.
wouldn't
one
picket
with
some
wood
signs
on
front
and
back
have
been
sufficient.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
one
afternoon
and
one
evening.
mr.
robert
lewis
which
caused
us
to
immediately
go
into
court.
we
didn't
want
to
wait
much
longer.
we
then
reached
the
crux
of
the
matter.
the
union
claims
freedom
of
speech.
the
state
claims
a
duty
to
regulate
on
behalf
of
its
citizens.
the
state
strikes
a
balance.
the
question
is
should
this
court
disturb
the
balance
struck.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
in
the
past
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
correct
and
we
would
never
have
sought
an
injunction.
mr.
robert
lewis
your
honors,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
be
satisfied
only
within
the
premise
of
the
state
court
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
have
argued
in
response
to
colloquy
in
questions
as
to
what
i
consider
proper
picketing
of
reasonable
regulation
but
i
submit
your
honor
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
either
this
court
should
affirm
the
state
court's
actions
here
in
view
of
what
took
place.
i'm
not
saying
that
in
another
case,
the
state
could
or
act
differently.
i'm
saying
that
a
state
should
be
left
to
make
this
determination
providing,
it
doesn't
prohibit
picketing
entirely.
have
i
made
myself
clear?
mr.
robert
lewis
well,
i'll
try
it
again.
mr.
robert
lewis
there
is
no
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes,
your
honor.
you
put
it
very
well.
mr.
robert
lewis
no
sir.
the
conduct
enjoined
here
was
primary
picketing.
mr.
robert
lewis
not
at
least
and
i
think
the
best
evidence
is
that
for
the
18
months
that
they
were
picketing
out
there,
nobody
said
a
word
including
my
client,
logan
valley.
now,
in
the
past,
this
court
--
this
court
has
been
reluctant
to
disturb
state
court's
injunctions
in
this
area
except
of
course
where
there
is
total
coefficient
of
picketing.
this
court
stated
that
a
state
court's
judgment
is
entitled
to
a
waiting
title
of
respect.
it
is
true
that
other
states
have
balanced
differently.
for
example,
california's
public
policy
is
set
forth
by
a
specific
exclusion
from
its
trespass
statute.
as
a
result,
california's
public
policy
therefore
is
to
permit
labor
union
picketing
within
a
shopping
center.
pennsylvania
in
a
factual
matrix
of
this
case,
through
its
judiciary
declares
conversely
by
affirming
pennsylvania,
this
court
does
not
upset
california's
public
policy.
these
differences
of
public
policy
illustrate
as
this
court
has
recognized
that
states
have
different
social
and
economic
views
and
that
each
state
must
be
free
to
determine
its
own
views
on
this
matter.
of
course,
the
injunction
here
as
we
see
it
was
a
narrow
one
and
not
enjoining
all
picketing.
it
merely
regulated
the
picketing
to
a
particular
place.
thus,
i
submit,
it
accommodated
all
interest,
the
union's
interest
in
communication
with
potential
customers
was
preserved
as
they
continue
to
picket
at
the
berms,
right
at
the
point
where
the
customers
entered,
weis'
property
rights,
whatever
they
were,
were
preserved.
the
public's
right
to
trade
without
interference
was
maintained
and
the
states
right
to
maintain
domestic
peace
was
preserved.
it
is
submitted
that
this
was
a
reasonable
and
proper
balance.
but
the
union
now
argues
that
pennsylvania
was
preempted.
from
arriving
at
this
reasonable
accommodation,
although
we
have
argued
this
question
in
our
brief,
we
submit
that
this
court
need
not
reach
it.
i
might
add
that
although
the
term
sidewalk
has
been
used
here
today
and
all
other
courts
in
this
case
have
used
the
term
porch,
this
is
in
fact
a
noncontiguous
sidewalk.
when
the
case
arose,
it
was
just
this
one
store
with
sears
off
to
the
side
and
a
lot
of
construction
going
on.
this
is
not
the
type
of
sidewalk
that
one
visualizes
either
on
a
public
thoroughfare
or
within
a
possible
shopping
center.
this
court
--
this
porch
didn't
go
anywhere.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
waiver,
we
submit
that
preemption
is
a
claim
of
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
this
court
has
refused
to
entertain
such
a
claim
unless
first
presented
to
the
highest
state
court.
the
law
of
pennsylvania
is
that
it
will
not
consider
a
question
not
presented
to
it
according
to
its
rules.
the
question
framed
by
the
union
for
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
was,
did
the
lower
court
err.
there
was
no
reference
to
preemption
or
the
supremacy
clause
in
the
question
framed.
there
was
no
reference
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
or
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
union's
brief
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
argues
reversal
and
gives
reasons
but
preemption
was
not
one
of
them.
mr.
robert
lewis
where
were
those
objections?
mr.
robert
lewis
it
wasn't
there.
they
never
made
it.
oh,
let
me
refer
you
to
the
union's
question
framed.
mr.
robert
lewis
i'm
sorry,
yes.
that
brief
is
before
this
court,
it's
been
lodged
by
us.
we've
lodged
i
think
ten
copies
with
the
clerk's
office.
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
have
it.
at
any
rate,
you'll
find
--
if
you
do
have
it
before
you
--
it's
this
color,
if
this
helps
and
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
brief
for
appellants
and
statement
of
question
involved
is
on
page
2.
this
is
the
brief
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
on
page
2,
they
frame
their
question
and
that's
what
i'm
referring
to.
mr.
robert
lewis
shall
i
read
it?
mr.
robert
lewis
yeah
--
well,
not
too
long.
did
the
lower
court
err
in
granting
a
preliminary
injunction
without
hearing
and
thereafter
denying
and
dismissing
appellant's
motion
to
dissolve
or
modify
said
injunction
and
further
continuing
said
preliminary
injunction
where
in
a
suit
in
equity
by
the
owner
of
a
shopping
center
in
one
of
its
tenants,
it
is
established
that
appellant
union
peacefully
picketed
near
the
tenant's
building
within
the
confines
of
said
shopping
center
that
no
picketing
efforts
were
directed
towards
the
shopping
center
or
other
tenants
that
picketing
efforts
were
merely
to
inform
the
public
of
the
labor
dispute,
negative
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
granting
and
continuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
which
we
strain
appellant
union
from
picketing
within
the
entire
limits
of
a
shopping
center
area.
that's
the
total
question.
mr.
robert
lewis
you'll
not
find
it.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes
sir.
now
we
argued
in
our
brief
that
the
union
has
waived
this
defense.
the
union
argued
against
this
contention.
we
submit
that
a
claim
of
preemption
is
a
claim
of
violation
of
the
supremacy
and
commerce
clause
and
that
this
court
has
held
in
cases
cited
by
us
at
page
29
of
our
brief
that
such
a
claim
must
be
made
to
the
highest
state
court
and
the
union
hasn't
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right,
sua
sponte
and
to
the
extent
that
he
--
to
the
limit
of
the
extent
that
he
did.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
by
the
way
of
motion
which
is
in
the
appendix.
i
submit
in
the
appendix
at
page
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
not
sufficiently
under
the
court's
rules.
the
pennsylvania
court's
rules,
it
must
be
in
the
question
presented
and
it
must
be
argued
in
the
brief.
mr.
robert
lewis
rule
59,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
lewis
well,
i
pointed
in
my
brief
your
honor.
i'll
call
your
attention
to
it.
mr.
robert
lewis
page
30,
thank
you.
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
i
submit
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
it
must
be
raised
and
that
this
court
is
held
that
claims
of
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause,
equal
protection,
due
process
clause
our
waive
unless
it
were
raised
before
the
higher
state
court.
the
cases
that
i
cite
on
page
29
of
our
brief.
mr.
robert
lewis
this
one,
cio
versus
mcadory.
now
the
other
cases
are
supremacy
clause
cases
and
if
preemption
is
a
claim
of
violation
to
the
supremacy
clause
--
mr.
robert
lewis
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
versus
the
labor
board?
mr.
robert
lewis
just
that
one.
mr.
robert
lewis
cio
versus
mcadory.
it's
on
page
32.
well,
if
this
court
disagrees
however
with
this
position
and
consideration,
and
i
believe
that
this
question
of
preemption
should
be
decided
nevertheless
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
is
no
preemption.
initially,
we
submit
that
the
case
is
not
arguably
subject
to
the
act.
furthermore,
we
contend
that
even
if
the
matter
in
issue
were
arguably
subject,
there
is
--
excuse
me.
there
is
no
preemption
because
of
pennsylvania's
deeply
rooted
interest
in
protecting
the
privacy,
the
property
and
the
peace
of
its
citizens.
we
turn
first
to
the
two
sections
cited
by
the
union
in
support
of
its
claim
that
unfair
labor
practices
were
arguably
involved.
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
awhile
ago
concerning
secondary
activity,
i
responded
that
it's
the
conduct
enjoined
and
not
the
conduct
permitted
which
is
crucial
in
determining
where
the
activities
are
arguably
subject
to
the
act
and
i
responded
that
nobody
made
any
complaint.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
lewis
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
follow
you.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
this
injunction
--
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
following
your
thesis
your
honor
but
maybe
i
can
answer
it
in
this
way.
the
--
there
are
two
sections
cited
--
you
want
to
simplify
it?
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
well,
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
lewis
alright.
i
think
you
have
to
analyze
the
section.
the
section
8
(b)
(7)
deals
with
picketing
for
the
purposes
of
organizational
purposes
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
a
contract,
recognition
purposes.
if
neither
was
done
here
and
it's
considered
that
neither
was
done
here,
there
is
no
violation
of
8
(b)
(7)
and
there
is
no
violation
of
any
section
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
mr.
robert
lewis
okay,
now
on
the
question
of
section
7,
mr.
justice
white
pursued
that
with
mr.
dunau
and
i'll
be
frank
to
acknowledge
that
when
this
court
handed
down
its
garmon
decision
concerning
protected
activity,
i
was
somewhat
at
a
loss.
i
wondered
as
mr.
justice
white
apparently
wondered
how
one
could
get
a
determination
from
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
the
matter
is
protected
activity
certainly
if
the
union
did
not
file
a
charge
and
no
charge
is
filed
here,
there
is
no
determination
against
myself.
mr.
robert
lewis
and
what
would
i
allege?
mr.
robert
lewis
these
are
all
well
defined.
i
wouldn't
file
a
charge
that
--
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
right
and
i
would
be
in
a
loss
to
know
what
to
allege.
mr.
robert
lewis
no,
because
there
was
no
effort
to
influence
employees
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
no,
because
when
the
board
turns
down
the
charge
--
mr.
robert
lewis
i
disagree.
i
filed
many
charges
and
i've
had
many
even
turned
down
and
the
board
uses
a
stock
phrase
that
it
does
not
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
issue
a
complaint.
there
are
many
reasons
why
the
board
turns
down
the
charge
and
they
don't
tell
you.
they're
not
required
to.
but
there's
more
as
far
as
this
protected
question
and
when
if
i
may
finish
responding
to
you
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
advised
this
court
that
picketing
within
the
store
is
not
protected
activity
and
i
think
this
bears
on
the
question
that
you're
asking.
mr.
robert
lewis
alright,
yes
he
did.
mr.
robert
lewis
that's
correct
and
in
view
of
that,
it's
certainly
now
considered
by
all
parties
that
there
are
--
all
situations
of
peaceful
picketing
which
is
not
protected.
our
position
in
fact
is
that
the
picket's
interference
with
the
merchandising
operations
just
outside
the
door
is
as
much
a
disruption
of
picketing
and
this
is
much
a
disruption
of
business
as
it
wouldn't
happen
if
the
picketing
took
place
within
the
store.
it
must
be
remembered
your
honors
that
our
merchandising
operation
continued
after
the
purchase
of
the
merchandise
have
continued
while
the
cars
were
driven
up
by
the
customers
and
the
customers
got
out
of
the
cars,
the
weis
employees
left
--
they
didn't
leave.
so
they
work
there.
they
work
out
on
the
puzzled
pick
up
zone
all
day
long
and
as
the
cars
drove
in,
the
customers
got
out,
the
employees
assisted
the
loading
of
the
merchandise.
well,
this
is
as
much
a
merchandising
operation
as
it
took
place
within
the
store
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
distinction.
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
even
if
the
matter
were
arguably
subject
to
the
act
and
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be,
the
state
was
not
preempted
because
the
regulated
conduct
touch
interest,
deeply
rooted
in
local
feeling
and
responsibility.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
has
expressed
this
as
follows
in
this
case,
this
commonwealth
has
a
duty
to
protect
and
preserve
the
property
of
its
citizens
from
invasion
by
way
of
trespass.
the
interest
of
the
state
is
deeply
rooted
because
of
its
responsibility
to
maintain
peace.
it
has
a
responsibility
to
prevent
possible
breaches
of
a
peace
which
are
likely
to
occur
as
a
result
of
unauthorized
entrance
upon
property
of
another.
the
function
of
trespass
actions
in
preventing
violence
has
been
long
recognized,
in
people
versus
peduto,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
succinctly
stated
that
trespass
can
lead
to
violence.
the
court
further
stated
that
when
a
person
refuses
to
leave
another's
property
after
he
has
been
ordered
to
do
so,
a
threat
of
violence
becomes
imminent
and
this
court
recently
reaffirmed
in
lynn
that
where
there
is
such
a
possibility
of
violence,
the
states
must
be
free
to
act.
mr.
robert
lewis
in
our
situation?
mr.
robert
lewis
not
by
explicit
findings.
mr.
robert
lewis
a
peace
--
that's
right.
it's
found
that
there
was
peaceful
picketing
and
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
there's
peaceful
picketing
today
does
not
mean
that
there's
not
a
threat
of
violence
or
violence
tomorrow.
i'd
like
to
call
your
court's
attention
--
your
honor's
attention
that
although
the
thrust
of
the
lower
court's
decisions
were
premised
on
trespass,
there's
more
to
this
case
than
that
as
the
fact
show.
mr.
robert
lewis
in
the
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
mr.
robert
lewis
now,
you've
said
a
little
too
bluntly
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest.
i
would
agree
with
your
first
premise
that
that's
what
they
held.
but
they
held
it
in
the
factual
matrix
of
this
case,
they
said
it
in
the
opinion,
factual
matrix.
they
didn't
move.
mr.
robert
lewis
labor
picketing
--
uphold
labor
picketing
on
private
property?
mr.
robert
lewis
i'm
at
a
loss
your
honor.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
you
know
well
that
you
reserve
this
question
on
the
fairlawn
case.
and
this
is
the
first
time
since
then
that
the
question
has
been
put
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
lewis
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
robert
lewis
there
is
no
question
about
it.
in
handling
leafleting
situation
which
that
court
--
which
that
case
was
directed
to,
there
are
different
considerations.
mr.
robert
lewis
yes.
in
fact,
that
would
never
have
gone
in
for
the
injunction
if
there
is
only
one
handbill
standing
there.
mr.
robert
lewis
well,
if
there
were
13
handbillers
--
mr.
robert
lewis
obstruction.
first
of
all
--
may
i
respond?
i
don't
know
if
you
want
me
to
--
mr.
robert
lewis
okay.
i've
seen
it.
i'm
sure
as
you
have,
pickets
do
act
to
the
fact
that
they
are
physically
present.
it's
their
conduct,
it's
their
physical
presence
which
constitutes
a
consideration
in
this
court's
distinguishing
between
pure
speech
and
picketing.
now,
handbilling
although
a
person
naturally
has
to
hand
out
a
handbilling
--
a
handbill,
is
a
different
matter.
a
handbill
as
i
see
it
is
primarily
speech.
now,
nevertheless,
though
they're
handbilling
a
speech,
you
can
nevertheless
have
13
handbillings
which
would
constitute
--
handbillers
which
would
constitute
as
much
an
obstruction
as
with
13
pickets.
if
13
handbillers
stood
in
front
of
the
door
of
this
supermarket,
that
would
be
an
obstruction.
if
one
did,
that
would
not
be
and
that
would
never
gone
into
court
with
this
injunction.
we
conclude
as
we
began
13
pickets
did
march
at
least
one
day
for
abreast
and
it
seriously
disrupted
weis'
business.
a
threat
of
violence
was
imminent.
i
submit
your
honors,
i
was
there.
the
threat
was
there.
it
didn't
happen
we
move
quickly.
thus
--
mr.
robert
lewis
it
was
unnecessary
to
allege
it,
no.
i
don't
believe
we
did.
thus,
under
these
circumstances,
the
limited,
narrow
and
reasonable
regulation
of
the
picketing
by
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
should
not
be
disturbed.
thank
you.
