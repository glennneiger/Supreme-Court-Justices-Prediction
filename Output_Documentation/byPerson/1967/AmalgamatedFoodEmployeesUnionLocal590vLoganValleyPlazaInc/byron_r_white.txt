justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
companies
did
the
state
court
involved
5,
6
and
7.
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
fact
that
it's
not
violent,
it
doesn't
mean
it
isn't
obstructive.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
follow?
even
assuming
that
the
courts
are
wrong
in
saying
they
should
have
been
out
at
the
entrances,
they
could
not
picket
where
they
did.
you're
assuming
we
were
wrong
about
that.
it
could
still
be
a
question
whether
they
could
have
joined
the
picketing
which
interfered
with
the
automobile
traffic
at
the
picket
--
at
the
pickup
zone,
wouldn't
it?
and
if
the
court
was
rightful
all
about
that
and
your
preemption
point
follows
up,
would
that
require
an
affirmance?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
you
just
say
no
that
the
injunction
was
too
broad?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that
--
would
you
say
this
procession
was
bad
if
it
banned
only
the
picketing
on
the
sidewalk
within
the
pickup
zone?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
it
then
was
that,
do
not
picket
in
the
--
on
the
sidewalk
or
in
the
pickup
zone.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
that
was
bad?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
a
state
--
the
state
court
has
no
power
to
--
to
stop
picketing
there
if
it
interferes
the
vehicular
traffic
in
front
of
the
store.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
you
know,
it's
an
ordinary
large
office
building
and
the
prudential
say
happens
to
have
half
of
the
22nd
floor
and
they
have
the
usual
common
hallways
and
access
to
the
common
hallway
by
elevators,
and
one
or
two
pickets
just
march
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
prudential
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
have
to
really
rely
on
the
first
amendment
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
do,
i
don't
suppose
that
you
would
suggest
reaching
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
dunau,
in
--
on
the
first
amendment
ground
though,
you
wouldn't
really
distinguish
between
labor
pickets
and
other
pickets
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
and
anyone
who
wants
to
communicate
a
message
to
the
--
that
kind
of
a
public
should
have
the
right
to
picket
wherever
you
can.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
treating
any
place
of
business
that's
open
to
the
public
or
any
other
property
that's
open
to
the
public
like
a
public
park.
your
view
is,
i
gather,
that
--
and
anybody
who
wants
to
picket
and
communicate
in
--
on
that
property
can
picket
and
communicate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
long
as
he
doesn't
obstruct.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
apartment
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
too
private?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
open
--
delivery
--
it's
open
to
the
delivery
man,
it's
open
to
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
lot
of
people
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
can
we
ever
find
out
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can't
file
a
charge
to
the
labor
board
in
order
to
say
(inaudible).
i
would
say
that
this
(inaudible),
is
your
answer
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
a
different
congress,
so
that's
really
sort
of
a
surplus
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
it
is
if
it
is
the
charge
then
it
is
a
violation.
if
it
is
a
violation.
if
it
isn't,
it's
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
this
board
will
decide
whether
it
violates
8
(a)
(1).
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
just
said
that
everything
--
anything
that's
preempted
is
arguably
prohibited.
if
that's
all
that
was
said
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
file
the
charge
and
the
charge
is
turned
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
then,
it's
not
a
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
charge
is
sustained.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
picketting
has
appeared,
was
then
that
a
pick
up
on
the
street,
would
you
still
contend
the
state
court
in
accordance
to
regulate
that
this
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
rest
of
the
parking
lot
to
do
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
preventing
you
from
picketing
at
the
entrance
of
the
parking
lot?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
you
wanted
to
be
and
they
prevented
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
question
is
not
whether
the
state
court
may
prevent
any
picketing
in
the
shopping
center?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
you
mean
--
they
permitted
to
go
on
either
side
of
the
entrance?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
then
the
shopping
center
property
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
that
--
in
the
terms
on
the
--
according
to
the
terms
of
the
injunction
that
that
picketing
was
permitted
or
did
it
just
go
on
and
it
wasn't
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
injunction
says
picket
--
forbids
picketing
and
trespassing
upon
the
private
property
of
plaintiff
logan
valley
plaza,
inc.
including
the
parking
area
and
all
entrances
and
exits
leading
to
said
parking
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
any
--
any
reservation
of
the
right
to
picket
on
the
berms.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
maybe
that
you
just
didn't
apply
this
injunction
to
it.
maybe
the
union
picketed
on
the
berms
but
in
terms
on
the
--
according
to
the
terms
of
it,
it
forbid
picketing
and
trespassing
upon
the
private
property
of
plaintiff.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
it
says.
isn't
that
what
it
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
so
a
while
ago
that
it
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
think
the
--
i
would
understand
--
i
thought
it
was
part
of
the
right
of
way
of
the
road.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
do
you
say
that
what
this
amounted
to
is
a
total
prohibition
of
picketing
on
private
property
because
the
only
picketing
you
wanted
to
reserve
was
on
the
berm
which
is
on
private
property.

page
30.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
union
in
this
court
said,
well,
it's
quite
true,
we
never
raise
the
question
at
all
in
the
state
courts
at
anytime
that
we
would
like
to
raise
it
here
because
it
is
--
it
thus
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
to
enter
any
judgment
at
all.
what
would
be
your
answer
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
none
of
them
is
a
preemption
case,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right
but
none
of
them
was
--
none
of
them
has
to
do
with
the
labor
case
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board,
does
it?
justice
byron

white
just
that
one?
justice
byron

white
yes.
justice
byron

white
file
a
charge
against
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
or
(3)
or
(7)
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
couldn't
file
a
charge
that
they're
engaging
in
conduct
that
is
not
protected
by
section
7
and
therefore
it
should
be
enjoined.
but
you
have
to
allege
a
violation
in
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
but,
wouldn't
you
say
that
--
could
you
allege
that
this
is
a
coercive
activity
as
far
as
employees
are
concern?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
file
those
--
if
you
file
the
charges
and
the
board
turns
you
down
on
all
the
charges
you
filed
against
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
then
have
decided
that
the
conduct
is
not
protected?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dunau
answered
me
--
i
understood
him
anyway
that
the
board
would
have
decided.
justice
byron

white
are
there
any
cases
that
you
know
of
in
this
court
and
any
other
court
which
do
uphold
labor
picketing
on
private
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
private
property?
i
didn't
hear
mr.
dunau.
he
suggested
that
there
weren't
any
cases
that
he
knew
of
which
--
shopping
centers
--
justice
byron

do
you

this

byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
union
in
this
court
said,
well,
it's
quite
true,
we
never
raise
the
question
at
all
in
the
state
courts
at
anytime
that
we
would
like
to
raise
it
here
because
it
is
--
it
thus
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
to
enter
any
judgment
at
all.
what
would
be
your
answer
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
none
of
them
is
a
preemption
case,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right
but
none
of
them
was
--
none
of
them
has
to
do
with
the
labor
case
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
that
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
file
a
charge
against
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
or
(3)
or
(7)
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
couldn't
file
a
charge
that
they're
engaging
in
conduct
that
is
not
protected
by
section
7
and
therefore
it
should
be
enjoined.
but
you
have
to
allege
a
violation
in
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
but,
wouldn't
you
say
that
--
could
you
allege
that
this
is
a
coercive
activity
as
far
as
employees
are
concern?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
file
those
--
if
you
file
the
charges
and
the
board
turns
you
down
on
all
the
charges
you
filed
against
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
then
have
decided
that
the
conduct
is
not
protected?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dunau
answered
me
--
i
understood
him
anyway
that
the
board
would
have
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
cases
that
you
know
of
in
this
court
and
any
other
court
which
do
uphold
labor
picketing
on
private
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
private
property?
i
didn't
hear
mr.
dunau.
he
suggested
that
there
weren't
any
cases
that
he
knew
of
which
--
shopping
centers
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
the
first
time
this
question
ever
really
come
here
that
this
is
--
