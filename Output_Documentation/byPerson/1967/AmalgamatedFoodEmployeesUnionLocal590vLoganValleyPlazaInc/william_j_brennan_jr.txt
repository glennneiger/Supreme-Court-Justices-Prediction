brennan,

the
entrance
is
on
the
parking
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
fences
around
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
place
where
one
was
pulling
his
car
to
put
his
package.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
isn't
that
an
activity
somewhat
obstructive?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
does
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
you
think
--
so
you
also
say
you
may
have
one
or
may
have
two,
but
they
may
not
picket,
they
may
not
walk
either
one
or
two
in
the
pickup
zone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dunau,
does
your
argument
go
this
far?
i
suppose
you
have
some
of
the
large
insurance
companies
has
a
--
an
office
on
the
22nd
floor
of
an
office
building
and
the
clerk's
union
that
are
trying
to
organize
it,
and
they
put
a
picket
or
two
in
the
common
hallway
in
the
22nd
floor
of
the
building.
the
say
--
saying
pretty
much
the
same
thing
that
these
signs
are
--
would
the
first
amendment
protect
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
why
i
asked.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
mr.
dunau
that
the
board
has
not
had
occasion
to
deal
with
any
kind
of
conduct
on
an
area
like
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
meant
any
kind
of
activities
the
board
dealt
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
the
board
in
that
--i
should
remember
but
i
don't.
where
was
the
--
it
was
picketing
i
think
in
(inaudible),
where
was
that.
was
that
on
the
sidewalk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both
a
and
b
would
have
to
have
--
we
would
have
to
have
added
to
it
something
to
the
effect
except
that
there
maybe
one
or
two
of
this
case
maybe,
is
that
it?
that
they
show
picket
only
on
the
sidewalk
and
there
shall
be
number
within
two
and
there
will
be
so
many
phases
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
what
you
would
say.
it
would
be
an
appropriate
injunction.
if
a
and
b
so
far
is
a
complete
blanket
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
at
this
instance,
total
prohibition
was
indeed
reasonable
regulation?
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
1-b
of
prayer,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
the
prayer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lewis,
may
i
ask
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
used
to
be
in
my
day
at
practice,
if
you
want
an
injunction
like
this,
you
draft
it
and
the
court
signs
it.
is
that
what
happened
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
is
it
your
position
that
all
picketing
from
a
private
property
is
unlawful?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
framed
it
on
the
premise
that
the
berms
were
part
of
the
private
property.
part
of
the
shopping
center
parking
lot.
now
you
suggested
that
maybe
they're
not,
that
the
berms
of
the
parking
lot
are
public
property.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
adjacent
to
but
are
they
within
the
property
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
picture
here
at
page
83
is
that
a
berm?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
a
ditch
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
between
the
ditch
and
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
whose
property
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
know
something
like
this.
had
all
that
happened
here
was,
the
union
had
said
a
single
picket
to
the
path
to
walk
up
and
down
on
the
porch
without
obstructing
anyone
getting
in
or
out
of
the
store
whether
employees
or
customers,
you
would
have
thought
you
could
not
ask
the
state
court
for
an
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
would
have
been
whether
you
call
it
protected
or
activity
which
could
not
be
restrained.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
isn't
what
happened.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
what
happened
is
what
happened
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
comment,
i
know
it's
in
the
dissent
but
justice
cohen
at
least
said
if
the
union
activity
involved
herein
did
not
amount
to
trespassing
then
there
arises
the
question
of
federal
preemption.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
reached
it
explicitly
to
the
--
they
do
this
to
the
sua
sponte?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
that
raised
in
preemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
say
that
when
was

justice
william
j.
brennan,
