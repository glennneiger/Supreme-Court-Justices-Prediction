mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
dunau,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lewis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
speaking
of
the
issue
that
was
drawn
and
i
read
your
complaint,
you
sought
to
have
all
picketing
of
every
kind,
removed
from
the
property
of
the
respondent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
ground
that
it
was
private
property
and
they
were
not
entitled
to
it
and
not
entitled
to
do
so.
and
your
representation
to
the
court
was
that
the
picketing
be
placed
upon
the
public
thoroughfare
and
you
defined
these
berms
as
public
thoroughfare
did
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
issue
is
really
whether
or
not
there
can
be
any
kind
of
picketing
on
your
private
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
public
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
have
to
defend
the
whole
injunction
don't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
also
that
which
says
that
it
cannot
be
done
on
the
private
property
of
these
people
any
picketing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
just
want
to
know
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
doesn't
say
that
they're
entitled
with
the
13
pickets.
he
said
that
they
have
two
or
three
or
four
that
the
court
wanted
to
limit
it
to
that
and
the
court
had
a
right
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
for
the
purpose
of
our
case,
you
would
be
satisfied
if
we
held
that
they
could
picket
on
the
property
of
weis'
store
as
long
as
it
was
not
excessive
in
number
or
in
place
or
in
obstructive
manner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
prohibiting
all
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
picketing
on
private
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
so
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
lead
us
into
any
secondary
boycotting?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
--
if
you
put
it
out
on
the
berm
there
and
in
front
of
the
entrance
to
all
of
the
14
stores
on
there,
wouldn't
that
be
interfering
with
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
the
defendant
raise
that
question
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
page

by
reason
that
the
labor
management
relations
act
your
honorable
court
is
without
jurisdiction
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
we
go
that
far
then
you've
got
the
situation
where
the
injunction
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
picketing
of
any
kind
on
this
private
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
don't
contend
that
to
be
the
rule.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
issue
is
say
if
they
had
one
picket
or
two
pickets
and
no
more
on
the
private
property,
it
would
be
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
they
did
it
in
a
place
where
it
was
not
obstructing
anything
it
would
be
alright.
but
this
injunction,
this
injunction
proscribes
any
conduct
of
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
well,
why
wouldn't
that
be
arguable
--
why
wouldn't
that
be
arguable
before
the
labor
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
put
in
--
you
complained
in
your
complaint
that
this
was
private
property
that
they
were
trespassing
on
and
that
they
have
no
right
of
any
kind
to
picket
on
this
private
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
injunction
agreed
with
you
and
said
that
because
it
was
private
property
that
the
union
had
no
right
of
any
kind
to
picket
on
that
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
why
isn't
that
issue
arguable
before
the
--
as
to
whether
it's
arguably
protected
or
prohibited
by
the
labor
relation
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
section
7?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
mr.
dunau
conceded
that
that
it
wouldn't
be
protected
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
inside
the
store.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
find
that
there
is
threat
of
violence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
defined
who
is
not,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
put
that
in
your
complaint?
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
478,
amalgamated
food
employees
union
local
number
590
et
al.,
petitioners
versus
logan

and

mr.

chief

we'll
recess
now.
mr.

you
may

your

chief

and
public

chief

earl
warren
but
you
have
to
defend
the

don't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
also
that
which
says
that
it
cannot
be

on

of
these

any

chief

yes,
i
just
want
to
know
where
--
chief

he
doesn't
say
that
they're
