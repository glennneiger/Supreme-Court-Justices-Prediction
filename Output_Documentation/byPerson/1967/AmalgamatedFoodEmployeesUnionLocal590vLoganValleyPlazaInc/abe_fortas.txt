justice
abe
fortas
you
may
have
covered
this
and
if
you
did,
i'm
sorry
but
i
was
unable
to
get
clearly
in
my
mind
either
from
the
text
of
the
briefs
or
the
drawings
whether
the
pickets
were
on
the
little
walk
there
in
front
of
the
store
or
in
the
driveway
or
both.
which
one
--
how
did
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
--
let
me
be
very
clear
about
that.
you
are
saying
they
there
were
in
the
street,
that
little
driveway
--
justice
abe
fortas
then,
there's
a
curb
and
a
wall.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
they
were
picketing
in
a
way
that
ould
--
that
might
disturb
vehicular
traffic
or
just
pedestrian
traffic
or
both.
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
were.
justice
abe
fortas
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
in
both
places.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
say
pickup
zone,
you
mean
--
you're
talking
about
what
i
talk
about
as
the
driveway
where
the
vehicles
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
willing
--
you
--
you
would
be
willing
to
throw
the
court
to
say
that
you've
got
to
stay
out
--
stay
out
of
the
way
of
vehicular
traffic?
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
and
then
you
think
that
that
would
remit
them
to
what
i
call
the
sidewalk.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
you'd
further
be
willing
for
the
court
to
hand
her
an
order
that
would
be
a
reasonable
regulation
of
number,
etcetera.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
really
--
do
you
really
mean
that
or
do
you
differentiate
between
the
sort
of
case
that
justice
black
was
talking
about
in
the
parking
area
and
the
shopping
center?
that
is
to
say
let's
take
on
the
one
hand
a
single
store,
a
department
store
or
a
grocery
store
that
has
its
own
shopping
--
that
has
its
own
parking
area.
now,
do
you
think
the
same
rule
--
would
you
apply
the
same
rule
to
that
that
you
would
to
the
parking
area
for
a
shopping
center?
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
you
think
the
shopping
center
case
is
easier
for
you?
is
there
anything
--
any
difference
in
theory
or
principle?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
say
--
you
say
you
have
--
you
really
have
to
defend
your
position
with
respect
to
both
of
them,
both
the
individual
store
parking
lot
and
the
shopping
center.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
understand
that
preemption
defines
a
state
of
--
state
court
of
jurisdiction
to
do
something
about
violence?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
do
you
understand
that
preemption
prohibits
the
state
from
doing
something
if
an
aspect
of
the
otherwise
immune
picketing
is
the
disruption
of
traffic?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
preemption
were
not
necessarily
disposed
of
this
case
if
--
if
there
is
a
finding
that
--
and
we
don't
disturb
it,
that
the
vehicular
traffic
and
pedestrian
traffic
here
were
unreasonably
disrupted.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
state
would
still
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
made
the
opposite
answer.
justice
abe
fortas
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
also
the
fresh
air
that
makes
it
a
little
easier
for
you,
didn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
a
little
fresher
than
it
is
on
the
22nd
floor
of
an
office
building.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
do
you
concede
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
you
concede
then
that
the
fact
that
this
is
--
that
it's
a
private
property,
the
picketing
takes
place
on
private
property
that
is
to
say
the
shopping
center
property
does
not
make
the
picketing
unlawful.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
would
like
your
answer
because
you
say,
i
understood
from
the
adversary's
argument
that
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
was
whether
shopping
center
property
was
private
property
in
the
respect
and
with
the
result
that
picketing
thereon
was
not
permissible.
now
if
you
say
that
picketing
on
the
berm
was
permissible,
then
the
question
is
inevitable.do
you
concede
that
picketing
on
the
private
property
of
the
shopping
center
is
permissible,
it
is
not
unlawful?
justice
abe
fortas
and
those
circumstances
are
what?
do
they
relate
to
obstruction
of
traffic
or
do
they
relate
to
numbers?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
do
con
--
i
don't
want
to
press
you
to
take
a
position
that
is
not
yours
but
i
think
it's
very
important
for
us
to
know
whether
there
is
an
issue
here
as
to
whether
the
mere
fact
that
the
picketing
takes
place
on
property
of
the
shopping
center
makes
that
picketing
unlawful.
justice
abe
fortas
i
still
have
to
know
that
after
all
of
these
whether
it's
your
position
that
all
of
the
property
owned
by
your
client,
the
shopping
center
is
in
such
status
by
reason
of
private
ownership
that
it's
unlawful
to
picket
on
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
know
what
you
said
in
your
complaint
but
i
want
to
know
what
your
submission
is
to
this
court.
is
it
or
is
it
not
that
you
take
the
position
of
the
entire
property
of
the
shopping
center,
privately
owned
property
of
the
shopping
center
is
such
as
to
make
picketing
unlawful?
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
what?
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
that
mean?
justice
