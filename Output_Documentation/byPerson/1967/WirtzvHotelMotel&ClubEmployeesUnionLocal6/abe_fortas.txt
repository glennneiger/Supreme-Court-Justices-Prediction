justice
abe
fortas
mr.
weinstein,
i
suppose
that
this
is
really
a
very
narrow
question
on
the
merits
of
this
bylaw.
and
the
question
is
precisely,
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
appearing
on
page
40
of
your
brief.
every
member
in
good
standing
shall
be
eligible
to
be
a
candidate
and
to
hold
office.
except
on
section
504
into
reasonable
qualifications
uniformly
imposed.
justice
abe
fortas
the
question
is
so
the
statute
sets
its
standard
in
every
member
in
good
standing
shall
be
eligible
and
then
it
says
that
it
impose
a
reasonable
qualification.
the
question
is
does
reasonable
qualifications
really
mean
that
you
can
eliminate
some
persons
who
are
candidates
in
good
standing
on
this
basis
and
then
now
it
comes
down
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
ordinarily,
if
you
read
that
as
meaning
qualification
such
as
citizenship,
length
of
membership
in
the
union
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
it
might
be
a
little
odd
to
say
that
to
be
eligible
to
be
a
candidate
and
hold
elective
office,
you
have
to
have
held
elective
office.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
weinstein,
i
beg
your
pardon.
if
we
should
remand
this
case
with
directions
to
hold
a
supervised
election,
does
that
mean
that
we
would
not
have
to
rule
on
whether
the
three
additional
alleged
violations
were
improperly
explicit
in
consideration?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
cohn,
i
wonder
if
that's
really
the
starting
point
of
this
court.
the
statute
says
that
every
member
in
good
standing
shall
be
eligible
to
be
a
candidate
and
to
hold
office,
does
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there's
a
parenthesis
and
it
says
subject
to
reasonable
qualifications
uniformly
imposes
but
we
start
that
we
submit
in
statement
form
for
your
comment.
we
start
that
a
congressional
statement
of
policy
or
basic
principle
that
every
member
shall
be
eligible
to
be
a
candidate
and
to
hold
office
and
then
there
is
a
provision
for
a
reasonable
qualifications,
uniformly
imposed.
now,
it's
at
least
arguable
that
the
burden
is
very
heavy
on
a
union
to
show
that
anything
that
results
in
members
in
good
standing
not
being
eligible
to
be
a
candidate
is
within
the
intendment
of
this
phrase,
‘reasonable
qualification.’
with
that
burden
is
very
heavy
indeed
and
i've
heard
nothing
on
what
you
said
and
what
i
have
read,
subject
of
course
to
further
thought
of
study.
i've
heard
nothing
that
isn't
applicable
within
a
degree
to
every
union
and
indeed
every
democratic
organization
success
as
i
understand
it
and
as
i
understand
the
congressional
theory
here
is
very
doubtful
that
success
provides
a
basis
for
self
perpetuation.
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
new
timers
are
there?
justice
abe
fortas
there
are
a
lot
of
new
timers,
aren't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
no.
that
has
to
say
reasonable
qualification.
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
to
say
that
you
--
that
a
man
can't
join
a
union
that
after
make
it
possible
i
should
think
for
a
union
to
say
that
you
can't
join
the
union
today
for
example
and
run
for
office
tomorrow.
and
if
they
have
not
included
that
phrase,
reasonable
qualifications,
they
would
have
merely
done
a
flat
injunction
that
would
have
prohibited
even
that
or
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
even
--
go
ahead.
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
the
old
one,
there
was
a
two-year
prior
membership
qualification,
wasn't
there?
justice
abe
fortas
one
year?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
now
raised
--
justice
abe
fortas
two
years.
and
have
you
now
raised
that
up
to
five?
justice
abe
fortas
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
before
this
time,
to
run
for
a
general
office,
all
you
have
to
have
was
two
years
of
membership
in
the
union
plus
having
been
an
officer.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
have
--
so
you
have
raised
it
from
two
years
to
five
years
for
the
top
officers.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
just
address
yourself
to
the
number
of
years
you
have
to
have
been
a
member
of
the
union
under
the
old
bylaw
and
under
the
new.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
it
under
the
new
one?
justice
abe
fortas
to
be
a
member
--
you
could
be
elected
on
one
of
those
top
officers
if
you
were
--
have
three
years
or
in
bad
standing
as
a
member
of
the
union
as
well
as
two
years
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that's
not
a
very
impressive
distinction
here,
is
it
mr.
cohn?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this.
you're
going
to
have
an
election
in
two
weeks.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
thereafter
we
decide
that
the
secretary's
request
that
a
supervised
election
should
be
held
is
sent
and
we
send
the
case
back
with
appropriate
instructions
to
have
a
supervised
election.
now,
do
you
have
some
doubt
that
the
holding
of
that
supervised
election
or
our
order
in
the
holding
of
that
supervised
election
would
wipe
out
the
results
of
the
election
that
you're
going
to
have
in
two
weeks?
justice
abe
fortas
how
could
we
fail
to
order
it
if
we
ordered
a
supervised
election?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
making
a
very
strong
argument
for
a
supervised
election.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
possible
theoretically
for
a
union
to
keep
one
election
ahead
of
the
courts,
and
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
that
may
turn
out
to
be
theoretical.
justice

fortas
