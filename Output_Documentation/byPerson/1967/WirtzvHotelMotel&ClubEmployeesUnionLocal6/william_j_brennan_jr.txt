justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
--
did
you
say
mr.
weinstein
that
there
were
10
delegates
and
seven
vice
presidents.
this
would
look
as
though
the
administrative
board
should
be
21
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
said
the
fact
that
they're
less
than
that
because
some
of
the
delegates
are
also
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
any
idea
mr.
weinstein
how
many
above
the
7%
on
the
1,700,
this
adds
to
the
list
of
eligibles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
largely
union
members
of
over
five
years,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
the
new
color
that
--
one
may
run
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
these
options
if
he'd
just
been
a
member
for
five
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
to
how
many
this
adds
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
suppose
that
you
would
add
that
into
that
many
who
will
become
eligible
by
reason
of
five
years
membership,
the
shop
delegates
would
have
to
be
from
among
those
who
have
less
than
five
years
membership
that
are
also
shop
delegates.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
un
--
under
the
new
rule,
do
they
--
and
you
appoint
an
officer
with
less
than
five
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
does
that
sum
up
that
basically,
the
secretary's
position
is
that
you've
already
said
a
violation
being
found,
nothing
in
the
union
can
do
to
clean
it
up
that
the
statute
contemplates
that
there
must
be
a
laboratory
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
i
gather,
the
secretary
negotiates
some
kind
of
settlement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
the
secretary
may
still
do
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
say
that
alternative
was
attendance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
before
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
proceed,
mr.
weinstein.
it
is
not
the
secretary's
position
is
it
that
experience,
whatever
may
be
the
touchstone
of
it.
it's
per
se
an
inadmissible
as
the
reasonable
qualification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
understand
it
--
as
i
understand
you,
the
secretary
proposes
is
in
essence
of
what
freedom
of
choice
in
the
context
of
particular
qualification
do
members
have
to
mount
opposition
to
an
administration,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
within
the
secretary's
proposed
standard
would
there
be
any
room
for
a
qualification
based
on
experience?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
--
even
if
the
changes
now
made
increase
the
eligibles
to
some
17
--
18,000
there
are
still
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
because
there
are
still
10,000
who
would
not
be
eligible.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
your
view
mr.
weinstein
is
that
even
with
the
changes,
the
ineligibility
of
10,000
suggests
the
unreasonableness
of
the
qualification.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
this
must
also
mean
then
that
a
qualification
based
on
length
of
membership
has
to
fall,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
in
other
words,
one
year
or
two
years
that
might
be
different
from
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
invoke
practices
of
general
application
in
public
elections.
are
there
not
qualifications
for
eligibility
for
office
which
depend
on
years
of
residence
in
the
state
or
county
or
municipality?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
that
have
to
be
made
then
to
perhaps
every
local,
depending
on
the
turnover
rate
of
a
particular
membership,
wouldn't
it?
i
guess
this
too
that
the
great
many
unions
have
a
very
high
turnover
rates.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
answer
on
that
issue
wasn't
here
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mister
before
you
sit
down
mr.
weinstein.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
this
union
election
on
the
amended
bylaw
is
scheduled
for
three
weeks?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
have
you
to
say
if
we
should
ultimately
agree
with
the
secretary's
decision?
i
gather
that
election
then
is
nullity,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
regard
to
them.
and
i
take
it,
there's
been
no
--
the
secretary
has
in
any
court
sought
a
restraint
against
the
conduct
to
that
election
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
has
not
so
far.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
he
did,
where
would
you
have
to
go?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
mr.
cohn,
the
issue
for
us
is
really
where
the
congress
notwithstanding
of
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
now
interposed
to
some
restraints
on
the
selection
--
that's
the
real
issue
we
have,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
a
word
of
fact
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
compose
of
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
well,
unless
you
finish
that
sort,
i
have
one
other
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
was
this.
i
know
this
is
a
local
one
also
new
york
with
some
11,183
members.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
just
one
particular
craft
calling
whatever
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
--
how
about
the
other
one
the
local
11,
what
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
was
interested
of
that
apparently,
the
experience
requirement
according
to
exhibit
69
is
not
the
one
that
local
1
follows
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
like
exhibit
69
in
the
case,
it
does
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
is
there's
going
to
be
an
opposition
slate
this
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
a
union
member
for
five
or
more
years
who
has
never
paid
his
dues
run
for
office
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
it's
not
would
have
been.
its
may
have
been.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
--
isn't
that
important
mr.
cohn
what
judge
wyatt
said
as
i
believe
in
that
opinion,
his
standard
was
could
not
have
affected.
that's
not
the
statutory
language,
the
statutory
language
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
difference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sorry
mr.
cohn.
if
you
go
through
this
scheduled
election
next
two
or
three
weeks
and
we
should
not
agree
with
your
position
on
either
of
these
points,
i
gather
that
election's
nullity
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
did
say
that
i've
forgotten
in
which
one
of
the
other
cases
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
have
we
not,
where
there's
been
found
a
violation
of
the
statute,
those
supervening
union's
supervised
election
can
prevent
the
secretary
having
the
secretary
supervised
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
that
has
to
carry
with,
it
doesn't
it,
that
if
the
secretary
does
go
through
it
on
election,
any
supervening
election
including
this
one.
that
doesn't
follow?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
if
the
language
--
this
is
in
bottle
blowers
that
it's
incorrect
to
read
the
provision
circumscribing
the
time
and
basis
of
the
secretary's
intervention
is
somehow
conditioning
his
right
to
relief.
once
that
intervention
has
been
properly
invoked,
substance
construction
would
ignore
the
fact
that
congress,
although
committed
to
minimal
intervention
was
obviously,
equally
committed
to
making
that
intervention
once
warranted,
effective
in
carrying
out
the
entire
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
hypothesizing
that
we
were
not
to
agree
with
your
position
either
as
to
the
bylaw
or
as
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
violation
of
the
bylaw
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
question
is
foreclosed
but
anything
we've
already
said
with
the
last
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
certainly
a
distinction
on
the
facts
is
quite
relevant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
an
argument
to
be
addressed
by
the
secretary,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
would
suppose
if
you
--
the
secretary's
election,
he
approved
that
the
conduct
of
his
election
under
your
new
bylaw,
that's
one
thing
and
if
you
didn't
and
you
went
ahead
with
your
election
under
your
new
bylaw,
i
should
think
there's
some
difficulty
with
that
in
light
to
what
we
said
in
glass
blowers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
your
day
in
court
can't
come
until
after
you've
been
through
the
procedure
through
the
secretary
under
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
that's
what
the
statutory
scheme
comes
in
place.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
perfectly
--
it's
a
little
bit
different.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
very
--
not
very
slight.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
--
are
you
really
saying,
i
wonder,
that
unless
one
can
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
following
of
the
--
by
hypothesis
invalid
bylaw,
did
not
affect
the
election
then
you
must
conclude
that
it
may
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
are
you
going
--
is
it
any
easy
to
know
when
something
did
not
affect
it
and
when
it
did
under
this
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
--
did
you
say
mr.
weinstein
that
there
were
10
delegates
and
seven
vice
presidents.
this
would
look
as
though
the
administrative
board
should
be
21
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
said
the
fact
that
they're
less
than
that
because
some
of
the
delegates
are
also
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
any
idea
mr.
weinstein
how
many
above
the
7%
on
the
1,700,
this
adds
to
the
list
of
eligibles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
largely
union
members
of
over
five
years,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
the
new
color
that
--
one
may
run
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
these
options
if
he'd
just
been
a
member
for
five
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
to
how
many
this
adds
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
suppose
that
you
would
add
that
into
that
many
who
will
become
eligible
by
reason
of
five
years
membership,
the
shop
delegates
would
have
to
be
from
among
those
who
have
less
than
five
years
membership
that
are
also
shop
delegates.

it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
well,
unless
you
finish
that
sort,
i
have
one
other
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
was
this.
i
know
this
is
a
local
one
also
new
york
with
some
11,183
members.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
just
one
particular
craft
calling
whatever
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
--
how
about
the
other
one
the
local
11,
what
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
was
interested
of
that
apparently,
the
experience
requirement
according
to
exhibit
69
is
not
the
one
that
local
1
follows
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
like
exhibit
69
in
the
case,
it
does
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
is
there's
going
to
be
an
opposition
slate
this
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
a
union
member
for
five
or
more
years
who
has
never
paid
his
dues
run
for
office
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
it's
not
would
have
been.
its
may
have
been.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
--
isn't
that
important
mr.
cohn
what
judge
wyatt
said
as
i
believe
in
that
opinion,
his
standard
was
could
not
have
affected.
that's
not
the
statutory
language,
the
statutory
language
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
difference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sorry
mr.
cohn.
if
you
go
through
this
scheduled
election
next
two
or
three
weeks
and
we
should
not
agree
with
your
position
on
either
of
these
points,
i
gather
that
election's
nullity
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
did
say
that
i've
forgotten
in
which
one
of
the
other
cases
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
have
we
not,
where
there's
been
found
a
violation
of
the
statute,
those
supervening
union's
supervised
election
can
prevent
the
secretary
having
the
secretary
supervised
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
that
has
to
carry
with,
it
doesn't
it,
that
if
the
secretary
does
go
through
it
on
election,
any
supervening
election
including
this
one.
that
doesn't
follow?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
if
the
language
--
this
is
in
bottle
blowers
that
it's
incorrect
to
read
the
provision
circumscribing
the
time
and
basis
of
the
secretary's
intervention
is
somehow
conditioning
his
right
to
relief.
once
that
intervention
has
been
properly
invoked,
substance
construction
would
ignore
the
fact
that
congress,
although
committed
to
minimal
intervention
was
obviously,
equally
committed
to
making
that
intervention
once
warranted,
effective
in
carrying
out
the
entire
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
hypothesizing
that
we
were
not
to
agree
with
your
position
either
as
to
the
bylaw
or
as
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
violation
of
the
bylaw
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
question
is
foreclosed
but
anything
we've
already
said
with
the
last
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
certainly
a
distinction
on
the
facts
is
quite
relevant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
an
argument
to
be
addressed
by
the
secretary,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
would
suppose
if
you
--
the
secretary's
election,
he
approved
that
the
conduct
of
his
election
under
your
new
bylaw,
that's
one
thing
and
if
you
didn't
and
you
went
ahead
with
your
election
under
your
new
bylaw,
i
should
think
there's
some
difficulty
with
that
in
light
to
what
we
said
in
glass
blowers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
your
day
in
court
can't
come
until
after
you've
been
through
the
procedure
through
the
secretary
under
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
that's
what
the
statutory
scheme
comes
in
place.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
perfectly
--
it's
a
little
bit
different.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
very
--
not
very
slight.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
--
are
you
really
saying,
i
wonder,
that
unless
one
can
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
following
of
the
--
by
hypothesis
invalid
bylaw,
did
not
affect
the
election
then
you
must
conclude
that
it
may
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
are
you
going
--
is
it
any
easy
to
know
when
something
did
not
affect
it
and
when
it
did
under
this
thing?
