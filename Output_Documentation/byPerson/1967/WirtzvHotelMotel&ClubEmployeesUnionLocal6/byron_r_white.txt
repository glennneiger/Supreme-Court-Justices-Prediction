that
would

have
conclude
inevitably
of
it

that
any

first
meets
the
flat
experience
of
qualification
would

justice

well,
i
wouldn't
blame
you.
justice

you
said,
you
really

you
really
don't
mean
to
say
that
experience
of

this

is
a
relevant
qualification.
justice
byron

white
well,
i
suppose
a
fortiori
though
you
would
say
that
the
membership
on
the
executive
board
as
a
prerequisite
to
election
to
one
of
the
core
officers
would
be
bad.
justice

well,
i
don't
--
i
can't
think
of
any
experience
of
qualification
in
running
this
union
that
you
would
accept.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
we
just
say
that
you
couldn't?

if
therefore,
you
must
say
that
the

view
is
that

the

it's

try
me,
i
am
not
suggesting
you
to
deny

but
you've
now
dispensed
with
the
--
i
take
it
dispensed
with
the
experience
involved.
justice
byron

white
mr.
cohn,
wouldn't
there
be
a
difference
between
a
supervised
election
under
the
new
bylaw
than
an
unsupervised
election
of
the
new
bylaw?
justice
byron

white
what
about
the
other
intentions
of
the
secretary
that
no
one
ever
reached
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
gold,
has
an
independent
ever
won
a
--
in
assembly
man's
position
against
the
administration
slate
in
this
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
effect
of
the
rule
is
to
restrict
the
candidates
for
office
to
those
that
the
present
administration
chooses
because
you
know
that
the
practical
experience
is
that
administration
slates
win
in
assembly
districts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
were
the
only
ones
who
are
eligible
to
run
through?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
people
preferred
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
inconsistent
with
the
free
choice
of
the
voters
in
each
district
perhaps
referring
the
people
put
up
by
the
administration
over
those
who
were
running
against
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
the
administration
--
the
union
ought
to
be
permitted
to
endorse
the
slate?
justice
byron
r.
white
nothing
worse
seemed
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore,
doesn't
necessarily
affect
an
election.
justice
byron

is
that
necessarily
pernicious?
justice
byron

white
you
mean
they
can't
win.

all
they

ask

another

what
do
you
think
may

in
the
effect
side,
it
probably

possibly

once
in

one
side
of

two
times

what?
justice

do
you

the

used
the

standard?
justice

you
would
