mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
while
mr.
cohn
has
gone
very
deeply
into
the
reasonable
rule
aspect
of
the
case
here,
he
has
very
properly
addressed
himself
to
the
specifics
of
the
situation
of
this
union.
i
would
like
to
divide
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
between
the
slightly
broader
consideration
of
that
and
then
turn
to
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
question
touched
down
by
mr.
weinstein.
the
aflcio
supported
the
enactment
of
the
present
title
iv
and
also
supported
its
precursor
in
the
kennedy-ervin
bill.
it
did
so
because
as
mr.
cohn
has
noted,
in
the
glass
bottle
blowers
case,
this
court
concluded
that
title
iv
was
a
carefully
limited
piece
of
legislation
which
took
proper
account
of
the
institutional
interest
of
the
unions,
of
membership
responsibility
and
of
the
complex
dynamics
in
this
area.
it
did
so
moreover
because
congress
carried
out
that
determination
by
utilizing
existing
union
constitutions
as
a
basic
governing
law
in
this
area
and
by
legislating
interstitially
within
the
framework
they
provide.
indeed,
in
following
this
principle,
congress
went
to
the
extent
of
deferring
to
union
constitutions
in
the
situation
in
which
the
claim
to
their
legitimacy
is
at
its
weakest.
for
even
when
the
secretary
runs
a
rerun
election,
he
must
do
so,
so
far
as
it's
lawful
and
practical
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
labor
organization.
it
did
so
in
short
because
the
congress
recognize
and
gave
substance
to
the
values
of
union
autonomy
and
membership
responsibility
and
because
congress
did
not
strip
union
members
of
their
right
to
evolve
the
constitutional
system
responsive
to
their
need.
we
believe
that
it
is
this
background
which
gives
the
answer
part
to
a
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas
as
to
whether
the
very
structure
of
section
401.
he
doesn't
indicated
that
a
union
has
a
heavy
burden
upon
it
when
it
passes
a
rule
in
defense
that
is
reasonable
and
the
other
major
labor
enactment
of
course
is
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
in
considering
a
proviso
to
section
8(a)(3)
which
prohibits
discrimination
that
permits
union
security
agreements.
this
court
in
machinist
local
versus
labor
board
362
u.s.
stated,
“it
is
common
place
but
one
to
easily
loss
sight
of
that
labor
legislation
traditionally
entails
the
adjustment
and
compromise
a
competing
interest
which
in
the
abstract
from
the
purely
partisan
point
of
view
may
seem
irreconcilable.
the
policy
of
the
act
is
embodied
in
the
totality
of
that
adjustment
and
not
necessarily
in
any
single
demand
which
may
have
figured
however
weightily
in
it.”
it's
for
this
reason
that
we
believe
that
the
purpose
of
the
reasonable
qualification
rule
is
to
ensure
that
union
members
and
their
concern
with
the
institutional
interest
of
their
union,
do
not
place
onerous
burdens
on
member
who
wishes
to
run
for
office.
we
submit
that
the
alternate
inquiry
should
be
whether
it's
fair
to
ask
a
member
to
undertake
the
test
the
rule
sets
out
as
a
predicate
for
eligibility.
so
this
reason
that
we
believe
that
the
rule
here
is
proper
which
asked
that
a
man
maintain
good
standing
for
one
year
and
then
submit
himself
to
the
members
in
his
district
and
seek
their
support
as
an
assembly
member.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
onerous
or
difficult.
we
believe
that
it
is
clearly
directed
toward
a
legitimate
purpose.
and
we
believe
further
that
since
the
ultimate
issue
is
fairness,
since
the
ultimate
issue
is
the
individual
member's
right
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
run
for
office
that
the
percentage
test
which
figures
so
heavily
in
the
administration
of
this
act
and
which
mr.
weinstein
stressed
that
points
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
criteria
that
the
secretary
brought
out,
don't
tell
us
anything
about
whether
the
rule
is
reasonable
or
not.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
don't
believe
so.
but
that
is
--
it
seems
to
us,
that
isn't
because
of
the
rule.
the
rule
is
neutral
in
that
regard.
it's
because
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
--
to
give
an
illustration
of
why
believe
that
the
percentage
test
is
unsound
that
the
union
could
pass
a
rule
requiring
members
to
attend
four
or
six
monthly
meetings
a
year
prior
to
the
election
in
order
to
run
for
office.
and
it
may
work
out
that
in
a
particular
union
because
people
aren't
interested
in
running
for
office
or
for
other
reasons
even
though
that
is
it
seems
to
us
to
be
the
very
essence
of
a
reasonable
rule,
there
would
be
a
rather
small
percentage
of
people
who
were
eligible
and
we
don't
believe
that
that
possibly
could
have
been
the
intent
of
congress.
congress
was
quite
specific
where
it
wanted
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
but
i
think
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
but
it
only
takes
one
year
of
good
standing
to
contest
an
assembly
seat.
the
rule
--
that
rule
is
perfectly
consistent
with
an
assembly
that's
divided
60%
for
the
administrative
party
and
40%
for
the
other
party.
it
happens
that
the
opposition
here
hasn't
been
effective
that
is
because
there's
an
unfair
rule
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
for
a
hundred
years,
the
democrats
couldn't
win
the
state
house
in
vermont.
we
don't
believe
that
that's
because
there
are
unreasonable
rules
because
that
was
a
non-democratic
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
and
we
think
that
the
same
thing
is
in
effect
here.
because
it
seems
to
us
plain
if
anything
can
be
gotten
from
the
literal
wording
of
the
statute
that
it
is
that
while
congress
accepted
the
notion
of
one
member
withstanding
one
vote,
it
did
not
after
the
standard
of
one
member
in
good
standing
of
one
candidate.
and
the
percentage
test
leaves
it
in
the
secretary's
hands
on
the
very
unrefined
standings
to
set
aside
rules
because
of
their
effect
through
hindsight
even
though
the
rule
places
a
fair
burden
on
someone
who
wishes
to
run
for
office.
it
doesn't
take
into
a
counter
effect
that
not
everyone
may
wish
to
run
for
office
and
indeed
that
the
better
the
organization
is
run
probably
the
fewer
--
the
number
of
people
who
would
wish
to
run
for
office.
we
think
therefore
in
practical
terms
the
secretary's
argument
here
results
in
the
proposition,
that
union
democracy
can
only
be
achieved
if
unions
are
limited
to
eligibility
rules
which
allow
any
member
in
good
standing
to
run
for
office
even
though
he
has
no
experience
and/or
knowledge
of
union
affairs
even
though
he
has
demonstrated
no
prior
interest
in
those
affairs.
this
argument
is
explicitly
grounded
on
a
dichotomy
between
membership
action
and
passing
eligibility
rules
and
membership
action
which
takes
the
form
of
casting
a
ballot
in
a
general
election.
the
secretary
says
as
much
on
page
18
of
this
brief
where
he
says
that
a
union
rule
isn't
the
embodiment
of
the
judgment
of
the
members
are
only
the
election
results
with
the
embodiment.
this
dichotomy
is
a
false
one.
it's
foreign
into
the
congress'
congressional
conception
of
union
democracy.
the
congress
quite
--
