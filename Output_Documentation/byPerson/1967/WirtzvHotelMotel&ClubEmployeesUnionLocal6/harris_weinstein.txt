mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
began
when
the
petitioner,
the
secretary
of
labor
sued
in
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
set
aside
an
election
that
the
respondent,
a
local
union
held
in
may
1965.
the
issues
arise
under
title
iv
of
the
labor
reform
law
of
1959
which
is
commonly
known
as
the
landrum-griffin
act.
as
the
court
knows,
the
scheme
of
that
title
is
to
set
forth
in
one
elaborate
section,
section
401,
a
variety
of
conditions
and
requirements
that
are
applied
to
the
union
elections.
the
first
issue
in
this
case
involves
one
of
those
requirements
drawing
out
of
a
provision
of
section
401(e)
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
towards
the
top
of
page
40.
that
provision,
section
401(e),
among
other
things
deals
with
qualifications
that
a
union
may
impose
upon
those
who
wish
to
be
candidates
for
elective
office.
and
it
says
that
all
members
in
good
standing
shall
be
eligible
subject
to
and
this
is
the
pertinent
statutory
language,
“reasonable
qualifications
uniformly
imposed.”
the
respondent
applied
what
the
district
judge
has
called
a
prior
office
holding
requirement.
it
required
those
who
wish
to
be
candidates
for
anyone
of
the
31
paid
full-time
positions
open
in
the
may
1965
election,
to
have
previously
been
members
of
the
body
of
the
union
called
its
assembly
which
existed
since
1951
or
instead
to
have
been
members
of
a
body
called
all
the
old
shop
delegates
council
which
existed
before
1951.
our
contention
which
the
district
court
accepted
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
is
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
requirement
within
the
intention
of
the
statute.
the
second
issue
before
the
court
grows
out
of
the
procedures
established
in
section
402
for
remedying
defective
elections.
that
section
sets
up
a
multistage
procedure.
the
union
member
who
is
dissatisfied
must
exhaust
internal
remedies.
he
complains
to
the
secretary,
the
secretary
investigates
and
then
if
he
thinks
it
warranted,
if
the
union
has
not
taken
voluntary
action,
he
bring
suit
to
set
aside
the
election
and
to
seek
the
relief
of
a
new
election
under
his
supervision.
the
second
problem
here
goes
to
the
conditions
the
statute
prescribes
as
the
requisite
to
the
grant
of
the
relief
of
a
new
election.
the
statutory
language
is
in
section
402(c)
which
is
towards
the
bottom
of
page
42
of
our
brief,
and
it
says
that
the
election
shall
not
be
set
aside
unless
the
district
court
finds
that
a
violation
of
section
401
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
the
district
court
here
held
that
even
though
the
prior
office
holding
requirement
wasn't
its
view
unreasonable,
it
could
not
say
that
the
imposition
of
that
requirement
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
we
contest
that
ruling
here
as
well.
there's
a
third
question
that
need
not
be
reached
if
the
first
two
are
answered
in
the
secretary's
favor.
and
this
was
a
question
akin
to
that
previously
decided
by
this
court
this
term
in
the
local
125
of
the
laborer's
union
case.
it
goes
to
the
relationship
that
must
exist
between
the
charges
the
secretary
makes
in
court
and
those
that
union
member
makes
in
his
complaint
to
the
secretary.
here,
the
union
members
complained
only
with
the
prior
office
holding
requirement,
both
within
the
union
and
to
the
secretary.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
correct,
justice
harlan.
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
resting
solely
on
that
second
question.
the
secretary
in
his
investigation
believed
he
had
uncovered
evidence
of
three
additional
violations
of
section
401
committed
in
connection
with
this
election
going
to
the
fact
that
some
officers
were
appointed
rather
than
elected
an
alleged
lack
of
timely
notice
of
election
districts
and
alleged
interference
with
voters
at
the
polls.
the
district
judge
struck
these
allegations
on
the
ground
that
the
union
members
have
not
complained
upon
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
there's
also
a
fourth
question
which
has
been
interposed,
i
believe,
for
the
first
time
in
respondent's
brief
in
this
court
and
we
have
not
dealt
with
it
in
our
brief
and
i
will
after
stating
the
facts
and
this
is
an
argument
that
because
the
respondent
has
changed
his
prior
office
holding
requirement
and
plans
to
hold
a
new
election
about
three
weeks
from
now
that
this
case
is
moot.
now,
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case
which
are
rather
complex
because
of
the
complex
organization
that
this
union
has
given
its
government.
the
union
represents,
at
least
to
the
time
of
the
may
1965
election,
approximately
27,000
people
employed
in
hotels,
motels
and
private
clubs
in
the
new
york
city
area.
i
believe
it
covered
all
boroughs
except
staten
island.
the
union
for
purposes
of
its
internal
government
is
divided
into
seven
districts.
six
of
these
are
geographic
and
each
of
the
geographic
districts
covers
all
of
the
hotels
and
motels
within
its
boundaries.
the
seventh
district
covers
all
of
the
private
clubs
within
the
union's
jurisdiction.
the
union,
both
with
--
the
union
as
a
whole
within
the
district's
--
within
each
hotel
or
motel
or
club
is
divided
into
departments
or
craft
units
and
there
are
basically
five
of
these.
the
housekeeping
workers,
the
kitchen
workers,
the
dining
room
workers,
the
banquet
workers
and
bar
workers,
each
have
a
department,
a
craft
organization.
and
then
within
each
hotel,
this
craft
organization
is
reflected
in
the
composition
of
the
shops.
each
dining
room
is
a
shop,
each
banquet
room,
each
bar
and
so
forth.
now,
the
general
organization
of
the
overall
government
of
the
union
is
somewhat
complex
and
the
hope
that
it
might
aid
rather
than
add
to
confusion,
i've
had
prepared
a
rather
summary
chart
of
the
union's
overall
government
and
ask
the
clerk
to
distribute
it
to
your
honors.
and
if
i
may
before
coming
back
to
the
craft
organization,
i'd
like
to
describe
the
people
who
are
listed
on
this
chart
and
how
they
are
chosen.
because
it
is
only
the
people
listed
on
this
chart
who,
since
1951,
have
been
eligible
to
run
for
the
full-time
paid
positions.
at
the
top
of
the
union,
their
major
officers
are
four
general
officers,
the
president,
the
secretary
treasure,
the
general
organizer
and
the
recording
secretary.
these
are
elected
by
the
membership
at
large.
next,
there
are
seven
vice
presidents
who
are
elected
from
the
seven
districts
that
i
mentioned
before.
one
from
each
and
each
vice
president
is
essentially
the
presiding
officer
of
his
district.
now,
there
is
a
provision
for
other
vice
presidents
to
be
appointed
by
the
assembly.
the
record
is
silent
on
when
this
provision
whether
this
provision
has
ever
been
invoked.
the
respondent
asserts
that
is
not
and
we
know
of
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
but
the
provision
is
intended
to
allow
other
vice
presidents
to
be
appointed
by
the
assembly
for
the
purpose
of
making
sure
that
there
is
at
least
one
vice
president
from
each
of
the
crafts.
then,
there
are
10
delegates
to
the
new
york
hotel
and
motel
trades
council.
these
are
appointed
from
the
--
by
and
from
the
assembly.
generally,
the
record
says,
they
also
hold
elective
positions.
the
trades
council
that
they
belong
to,
represents
a
multiple
of
unions
and
group
bargainings
with
the
hotels
and
motels
within
their
jurisdiction.
now,
those
who
i
have
mentioned
up
to
this
point
compose
the
administrative
board
of
the
union
and
the
union's
president
testified
below
that
these
are
the
people
who
on
a
day-to-day
basis
run
the
union.
now,
in
composing--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
can
vary
from
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
brennan.
i
didn't
intend
to
give
any
other
impression.
it
can
vary
up
to
21
but
our
understanding
is
it
is
not
and
it
could
be
as
few
as
11
if
all
10
were
either
vice
president
or
a
general
officer.
the
next
basic
group
in
the
union
is
the
executive
board
which
meets
on
a
monthly
basis
and
its
voting
members
constitute
the
members
of
the
administrative
board
plus
about
50
other
members.
these
50
other
members
are
chosen
from
the
overall
assembly
at
a
rate
of
one
man
for
every
500
union
members.
now,
in
1965,
27,000
union
members
would
have
meant
54
other
voting
members
of
the
administrative
board.
in
addition,
all
of
the
union's
business
agents
are
nonvoting
members
of
the
executive
board.
they
can
sit,
they
have
a
voice
but
they
do
not
vote.
20
business
agents
are
elected
and
i've
noticed
that
our
brief
in
page,
top
of
page
4
inadvertently
says
31
and
it
should
read
20
there.
they
are
elected
from
the
seven
districts
into
which
the
union
is
divided.
in
addition,
the
assembly
may
appoint
as
many
other
business
agents
as
it
thinks
desirable
or
necessary.
while
the
record
shows
that
some
other
had
been
appointed,
it
does
not
show
the
précised
number.
these
people,
together
with
all
elected
assembly
--
other
assembly
members,
compose
the
union's
assembly,
the
basic
body
that
makes
a
man
eligible
to
run
for
office.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
began
--
the
basic
plan,
as
it
now
exist,
mr.
justice
harlan
began
in
1951.
there
was
previously
a
body
called
the
shop
delegates
council
which
filled
the
function
of
the
assembly.
now,
it
may
be
that
there
was
also
an
executive
board
and
administrative
board
at
that
time
but
before
1951,
as
i
should
come
in
a
moment
if
i
may,
what
a
man
had
to
do
to
become
eligible
to
run
for
office
is
somewhat
different
than
he's
had
to
do
since
1951.
these
other
assembly
members
are
approximately
325,
350.
there
are
about
a
total
of
400
assembly
members
including
the
50
who
sit
on
the
executive
board.
they
are
chosen
from
one,
two
or
three
election
districts
within
each
of
the
seven
districts
at
a
rate
of
one
assembly
man
for
each
75
union
members.
now,
the
full-time
paid
positions
on
this
chart
are
essentially
three
groups,
which
are
four
general
officers,
seven
vice
presidencies,
the
20
business
agents.
a
person
who
wished
to
run
for
one
of
those
offices
in
may
1965
had
to
satisfy
the
prior
office
holding
requirement.
he
did
not
have
to
satisfy
that
requirement
to
be
appointed
say
as
an
additional
business
agent
or
to
run
for
any
of
the
other
positions
listed
here.
now,
the
union
as
well,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
has
a
craft
structure.
each
shop
within
each
hotel
or
motel
or
club,
at
least
i
think
it
has
five
or
more
members,
elects
its
own
representative
called
the
‘shop
delegate'
or
the
‘department
delegate'
variously,
who
fills
the
function
of
shop
steward.
he
is
essentially
the
leader
of
that
shop.
before
1951,
there
was
a
group
that
is
now
referred
to
as
the
old
shops
delegate
council.
every
shop
delegate
or
steward
who
held
such
a
position
before
1951
belong
to
that
council.
however,
when
the
assembly
was
created,
shop
--
being
a
shop
delegate
did
not
qualify
one
for
the
assembly.
so
in
consequence,
if
a
man
was
a
shop
delegate
or
steward
before
1951,
he
is
eligible
to
run
for
one
of
the
full-time
paid
positions.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
has
had
that
position
since
1951
and
only
since
1951,
that
does
not
give
him
eligibility
for
paid
position.
the
shop
delegates,
the
stewards
however,
have
a
variety
of
functions
within
the
union.
for
example
they
process
grievances
at
initial
levels.
they
also
represent
the
shop
members
a
variety
of
functions
in
the
union.
they
engage
in
the
shop
committee
which
is
a
group
of
all
people,
all
shop
delegates
and
i
believe
assembly
members
from
within
a
hotel.
they
participate
on
a
district
council;
the
body
which
the
bylaw
says
governs
that
--
one
of
the
seven
districts.
they,
together
with
the
vice
president,
the
business
agents
and
the
assembly
members
from
that
district
meet
together
and
govern
the
district.
and
then
both
on
a
district
basis
and
a
union
wide
basis,
they
participate
in
so-called
department
activities.
these
are
meetings
for
example
of
all
kitchen
delegates
or
all
banquet
delegates
which
focus
on
problems
that
in
--
peculiarly
of
one
trade.
the
union
president
also
testified
at
page
52
of
the
record
that
they
do
a
great
many
of
the
things
in
a
day-to-day
operation
of
the
union.
one
example
was
participation
in
the
social
services
the
union
gives
and
another
example
was
participation
in
legislative
lobbying
type
activities.
the
1965
election
was
the
fifth
that
the
union
has
had
since
1951.
there
had
been
apparently
considerable
opposition
in
1951
and
perhaps
two
or
three
complete
slates.
but
between
1951
and
1965,
there
was
no
organized
opposition
to
the
incumbents.
there
was
a
smattering
from
time
to
time.
one
election
was
dispensed
with
for
a
lack
of
opposition
but
all
of
the
others
were
held.
the
opponents
to
the
incumbents
were
overwhelmingly
defeated
in
each
of
these
intervening
elections.
and
in
each
of
these
elections
including
1965,
one
full
slate
was
offered,
called
the
‘administration
party'
and
appeared
on
the
first
row
of
the
voting
machine.
the
persons
who
were
on
that
slate
were
chosen
by
the
caucuses
called
by
the
incumbents
and
attended
by
union
members
selected
by
the
incumbents
and
this
is
what
it
has
been
called,
the
‘administration
party'.
in
1965,
the
‘membership
party'
was
formed.
it
was
the
first
organized
opposition
to
the
administration
party
since
1951.
it
sought
to
mount
a
slate
that
while
not
complete
perhaps
was
substantially
so
at
least
for
the
full-time
positions.
they
sought
to
offer
a
candidate
for
each
of
the
four
general
officers
for
five
of
the
seven
vice
presidencies,
for
eight
of
the
20
business
agent
positions.
they
also
offered
ten
--
these
that
i've
just
mentioned,
the
general
officers,
the
vice
presidency,
the
business
agents
are
all
subject
to
the
prior
office
holding
requirement.
they
also
offered
15
candidates
for
other
positions
to
which
this
requirement
did
not
apply.
and
these
were
for
10
delegates
to
the
international
convention
of
this
union.
there
were
ten
positions
open.
and
then
they
offered
five
candidates
for
the
370
odd
open
positions
on
the
assembly.
the
application
of
the
prior
office
holding
requirement
meant
that
eight
of
the
17
who
wish
to
run
for
the
full-time
positions
were
disqualified.
others
were
disqualified
for
failure
to
meet
a
requirement
that
is
not
an
issue
here,
that
a
candidate
be
union
member
for
two
years
in
good
standing
before
the
election.
mr.
harris
weinstein
justice
harlan,
of
the
27,000
union
members,
approximately
--
i
think
the
number
was
1,725.
about
6%
or
7%
of
the
membership
were
eligible
to
run.
now,
of
that
1,725,
1,100
gained
their
eligibility
for
membership
on
the
old
shops
delegate
council
before
1951.
of
the
remainder
several
hundred
of
course
were
on
the
administration
party
slate
in
this
election
are
taken
at
the
most.
there
are
1,700
taken
at
the
least,
there
are
a
few
hundred.
our
position
is
that
whatever
it
is,
7%
of
the
total
membership
is
just
too
few
to
be
reasonable.
now,
the
net
result
in
this
election
was
that
the
membership
party
ran
two
candidates
for
general
officer;
these
were
for
president
and
general
organizer.
no
candidates
for
vice
president
and
two
candidates
for
business
agents.
they
also
ran
eight
people
as
delegates
to
the
international
convention
and
two
as
delegates
to
the
assembly.
in
the
election,
about
11,000
and
40%
of
the
union
membership
voted
where
there
was
opposition,
the
membership
party
lost
by
a
margin
averaging
seven
to
one.
now,
if
i
may
first
turn
to
the
problem
of
mootness.
as
i
indicated
before,
this
argument
is
based
on
two
facts.
one
is
that
there
is
a
new
bylaw
that
was
adopted
i
believe
in
december
1966
just
prior
to
the
trial
on
this
case.
it
adds
to
the
qualifications
for
office.
those
who
have
served
as
shop
delegates
since
1951
and
any
other
person
who
has
been
a
union
member
for
at
least
five
years
at
the
time
of
election
and
the
contention
seems
to
be
that
in
respondent's
view,
this
is
plainly
a
proper
requirement
and
second,
there's
going
to
be
a
new
election
with
this
allegedly
proper
requirement
and
so
there's
no
need
for
the
courts
to
proceed
any
further.
mr.
harris
weinstein
justice
brennan,
i
found
nothing
in
the
record.
they
say
that
it
adds
about
14,000
or
15,000
that
they
are16,000
or
17,000
who
are
now
eligible.
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
would
probably
be.
we
don't
--
i
doubt
that
anything
like
that
number
would
have
been
members
of
the
--
let's
say
would
have
had
the
function
stewards.
however,
for
reasons
that
are
not
clear
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
we
think
that's
a
reasonable
requirement
and
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
judge
from
the
evidence
of
turnover
on
this
record
that
16,000
or
17,000
is
probably
a
close
approximation
of
those
who
had
been
in
the
union
for
five
years
and
i
would
--
mr.
cohn
would
be
more
up
on
this
than
i
but
i
would
assume
a
relatively
small
number
though
is
qualified
by
reason
of
being
stewards
or
shop
owners.
but
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
that's
correct.
and
again,
that
would
be
perhaps
a
smaller
number.
but
i'd
like
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
have
also
amended
their
bylaws
to
change
the
appointment
provisions
and
although
that
allegation
was
stricken
from
the
complaint,
i
understand
that
they
have
--
and
again,
i'm
not
sure
that
this
is
in
the
record
that
they
have
changed
that
appointment
provision
in
a
manner
that
it
would
have
been
demanded
in
a
supervised
election.
but
this
new
requirement,
this
new
bylaw
for
reasons
that
are
not
quite
clear
from
the
face
of
that
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
did
say
that
in
his
view,
this
was
an
unreasonable
requirement
and
that
matter
as
best
as
i
can
tell
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
would
not
think
that
it's
appropriate
in
this
court
to
be
arguing
that
it
is
clearly
a
legal
one
but
whether
it
is
or
not,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
doesn't
moot
the
case
for
the
reasons
that
this
court
set
out
in
the
decisions
earlier
this
year.
the
congressional
concern
that
this
court
talked
about
there
was
that
incumbents
once
having
come
in
to
office
unlawfully,
should
not
be
allowed
the
opportunity
to
perpetuate
themselves
an
office
by
some
improper
procedure.
the
public
interest,
as
we
understand
those
decisions,
requires
a
laboratory
type
of
election
under
the
secretary's
supervision
to
guarantee
that
there
is
no
future
violation
and
we
would
think
that
whatever
the
violation,
whatever
the
union
does
in
an
attempt
to
cleanse
itself
after
a
suit
begins,
this
just
doesn't
moot
the
secretary's
demand
for
a
supervised
election.
of
course
in
this
case,
we
think
it
even
less
appropriate
mootness
when
the
new
bylaw
has
been
called
unreasonable
by
the
district
judge
and
where
one
of
the
allegations
stricken
from
the
complaint
was
a
charge
of
improper
conduct
are
proposed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
once
the
suit
begins,
we
would
say
that
the
union's
opportunity
for
self
cleansing
ends
when
the
suit
is
final.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
but
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
assume
that
he
can
always
settle
his
litigation
but
i
don't
know
that
on
what
terms
that
would
be
done
but
at
least
the
union
cannot
control
of
the
case
away
from
the
courts
or
from
the
plaintiff.
turning
to
the
issue
of
reasonableness,
the
statutory
word
of
course
is
a
very
flexible
one
and
i
imagine
that
in
theory,
it
could
be
given
a
variety
of
meanings.
reasonableness,
i
assume,
means
different
things
in
different
context
depending
on
the
purposes
that
the
congress
or
the
legislature
had
in
mind.
i
don't
think
that
either
of
the
courts
below
stated
a
generalized
interpretation
that
they
thought
would
be
pertinent.
the
respondent
here
in
the
amicus
the
aflcio,
offer
an
articulation
which
i
think
is
the
worthwhile
starting
point
for
discussion
of
the
problem.
they
speak
of
reasonable
meaning
that
a
union
may
seek
what
they
call
a
legitimate
and/or
objective
by
any
rational
or
appropriate
means.
i
don't
--
those
words
of
course,
i
don't
think,
could
solve
the
problem
because
whatever
reasonable
it
may
mean,
i
don't
know
that
it's
anymore
clear
what
legitimate
means
or
what
rational
or
what
appropriate
means.
but
i
assume
what
they
mean
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
this
case
is
that
a
union
may
seek
by
a
rule
to
eliminate
people
without
experience
from
being
candidates
and
that
any
rule
that
is
logically
calculated
to
eliminate
the
inexperienced
is
a
reasonable
one
or
appropriate
one
under
the
statute.
the
case
i
guess
could
be
disposed
of
on
their
grounds
because
the
facts,
i
don't
think,
would
meet
their
standards.
for
example,
we
would
say
there's
nothing
rational
in
a
qualification
that
allows
1,100
people
to
run
for
office
when
their
experience
antedates
1951
or
that
excludes
from
running
from
office
al
of
those
people
who
have
been
shop
delegates
since
1951
and
who
on
the
union
president's
own
description
in
his
testimony
seem
to
have
very
little
in
the
way
of
experience
that's
materially
different
from
that
which
the
average
assembly
then
gets.
that
assembly
on
this
record
meets
four
times
a
year.
three
of
those
times
for
two
hours
or
three
hours
and
once
for
all
day.
the
record
shows
that
the
attendance
is
very
sparse
if
the
union
applied
its
own
rule
that
would
eject
any
assembly
member
who
missed
two
consecutive
meetings.
the
record
shows
that
some
two
thirds
of
the
assembly
members
would
have
been
eliminated
from
the
assembly.
yet
all
these
assembly
members
are
eligible
to
run
while
the
shop
delegates
whom
the
union
president
described
as
being
active
in
a
day-to-day
operation
of
business
unit
affairs
are
not
eligible.
we
suggest
that
that
just
cannot
need
any
test
that
they
describe
as
requiring
rationality.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
no
restriction
at
all
on
appointment.
now,
appointment
they
say
means
election
by
the
assembly.
but
in
practice,
the
union
president
testified
that
he
couldn't
remember
anytime
an
assembly
--
the
assembly
rejected
any
recommendation
of
the
other
bodies
and
i
assume
that
goes
to
appointments
of
business
agents
as
well.
the
record
shows
for
example
that
the
union
ran
a
class
in
the
early
‘60s
with
about
a
hundred
union
members
attended.
the
union
administration
then
selected
about
a
dozen
for
further
training
and
then
at
least
several
of
them
were
appointed
business
agents.
none
of
them
at
least
the
two
appointments
that
we're
going
into
in
this
record,
neither
of
these
people
having
satisfy
the
prior
office
holding
requirement.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
in
fact,
the
record
shows
that
one
of
these
two
people
who
is
discussed,
one
of
them
was
appointed
before
the
1962
election
at
least.
he
did
not
run
in
the
1962
election
but
he
was
then
reappointed
as
business
agent.
he
then
run
and
was
elected
in
the
1965
election.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
case
can
be
disposed
of
so
readily
because
we
think
the
legal
standard
that
the
respondent
in
the
amicus
suggests
they're
simply
wrong
but
it
doesn't
reflect
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
requiring
only
reasonable
qualifications.
the
purpose
as
congress
has
said
repeatedly
and
this
court
has
said
of
title
iv
is
to
assure
democratic
procedures
in
the
government
of
unions.
it's
to
assure
that
union
officers
periodically
must
go
back
to
the
membership
for
a
mandate
and
that
the
membership
had
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
contest
with
the
incumbents.
and
we
suggest
that
any
approach
to
this
case
has
got
to
be
bottomed
on
a
recognition
that
the
essential
governing
feature
has
got
to
be
“what
is
the
freedom
of
choice
open
to
the
union
members
who
wish
to
oppose.”
is
it
reasonably
possible
for
any
opposition
group
within
the
union
to
mount
an
opposition
slate
and
put
the
choice
to
the
good
sense
and
the
good
judgment
of
the
union
electorate
during
and
after
a
campaign?
in
approaching
these
cases
with
this
thesis,
the
secretary
has
developed
a
variety
of
criteria
in
his
administration
that
he
has
proposed
to
the
courts
as
a
foundation
for
decision
of
these
cases.
and
the
courts
until
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
have
generally
agreed
that
these
are
the
pertinent
condition,
the
things
to
be
considered
in
determining
reasonableness.
first,
because
of
the
congressional
emphasis
of
what
is
democratic
and
what
is
not
and
that
this
election
should
be
democratic,
the
secretary
has
advanced
the
idea
that
a
principle
reference
must
be
made
to
those
conditions
that
are
opposed
in
the
polity
of
country
generally.
in
sense,
what
sorts
of
requirements
are
generally
accepted
in
democratic
elections
as
they're
known
here?
now,
we
would
think
that
on
this
basis,
it's
doubtful
that
any
prior
office
holding
requirement
can
be
upheld.
it's
just
too
foreign
to
the
type
of
procedures
that
american
democracy
has
developed.
but
we
don't
make
the
argument
that
such
a
per
se
rule
should
be
adopted
and
we
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
for
the
disposition
of
this
case.
for
example,
there's
a
variety
of
other
criteria
that
we
have
advanced
and
the
courts
have
considered
and
under
all
of
them,
we
think
that
the
union
requirement
in
this
case
has
to
be
disapproved.
as
i
indicated
before
in
response
to
justice
harlan,
the
requirement
in
this
case
disqualifies
some
93%
or
94%
of
the
union
membership
from
running
for
office.
with
this
type
of
disqualification
when
of
the
7%
such
a
substantial
number
have
not
been
active
in
the
assembly
or
the
general
government
since
1951
when
another
large
group
is
taken
up
by
the
administration
slate
in
this
or
any
other
election
because
incumbents
are
--
a
large
number
of
incumbents
are
generally
re-nominated.
how
possibly
can
there
be
any
assurance
that
a
group
within
the
union
that
wishes
to
oppose
can
find
candidates
who
will
be
allowed
to
run?
they
simply
cannot
when
the
restriction
is
this
substantial
and
we
suggest
that
this
too
makes
it
unreasonable.
now,
another
factor
which
we
advance
is
what
the
general
practice
in
the
labor
community.
the
secretary
introduced
in
the
district
court
a
substantial
amount
of
evidence
going
to
the
practices
of
unions
generally
and
there
are
several
exhibits
beginning
in
this
record.
i
believe
with
exhibit
69
at
page
249
that
analyzes
unions
in
this
country
by
factors
that
were
thought
to
make
them
in
some
way
comparable
to
local
sets.
for
example,
exhibit
69
analyzes
the
120
at
large
unions
in
the
same
business,
the
local
unions
and
respondents
owned
international.
and
it
show
that
only
about
25%
if
them
have
this
sort
of
requirement.
and
then
when
we
go
onto
the
other
comparisons,
the
requirement
becomes
even
less
frequent.
for
example,
exhibit
70
analyzed
international
unions
and
this
begins
on
page
258
of
the
record,
international
unions
having
a
total
membership
of
20,000
to
40,000
people.
and
this
group
was
chosen
because
the
20,000
to
40,000
range
was
somewhat
comparable
to
the
27,000
members
and
respondents
roles
and
not
a
single
one
of
the
unions
in
that
category
had
any
requirement
of
this
nature.
then
exhibit
71
which
begins
on
exhibit
--
on
page
260
analyzed
the
constitutions
of
the
major
national
unions
in
this
county.
it
analyzed
those
constitutions
of
72
of
these
unions,
i
believe,
to
determine
whether
a
private
--
a
prior
office
holding
requirement
was
imposed
on
the
locals
within
the
union.
the
only
such
requirement
that
was
found
was
in
the
international
ladies
garment
workers
union
and
that
union
offered
an
alternative
to
prior
office
holding
which
was
of
course
sponsored
by
the
union
and
union
management
that
as
far
as
we
know
from
this
record
was
open
to
all
and
everyone
who
took
the
course
became
eligible
to
run.
but
as
this
exhibit
shows
many
locals
with
membership
roles,
comparable
to
these
unions,
larger
than
these
unions
had
no
such
requirement,
it
just
didn't
any
need
for
it.
and
the
final
comparison
put
in
before
the
district
court
which
begins
on
page
260
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
it's
the
next
class
on
page
266,
analyzed
national
unions
and
found
again
with
the
exception
of
the
ladies
garment
workers,
there
was
no
requirement.
i
believe
that
i
misspoke
myself
in
describing
exhibit
71.
one
of
the
criteria
for
selection
of
large
unions
there
were
the
receipts
and
these
unions
not
only
are
large
in
membership
but
they
are
believed
to
be
the
locals
in
the
country
that
have
receipts
in
excess
of
$1
million,
thus,
making
them
in
financial
size
and
presumably
a
need
for
financial
judgment
comparable
to
this
union.
so
that
in
total,
the
evidence
showed
quite
overwhelmingly,
we
think,
that
this
type
of
requirement
is
a
very
rare
beast
indeed
within
the
labor
movement
itself,
existing
only
within
a
few
locals
of
this
international
and
within
the
international
ladies
garment
workers
union
which
has
the
alternative
and
the
only
other
thing
comparable
to
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
attendance
at
a
training
class.
now,
i
think
there
is
rather
interesting
contrast
because
there
was
one
training
class
held
in
this
union
in
the
early
60s
but
those
who
took
it
did
not
become
eligible
for
--
to
run
for
office
unless
they
were
selected
by
the
incumbents
to
take
further
training
and
were
then
appointed
by
the
assembly
as
on
the
recommendation
of
the
economist
of
course
as
business
agents.
whereas
we
understand
the
garment
workers
union,
you
become
eligible
simply
by
showing
up
with
the
course
and
taking
it.
but
the
record
is
a
bit
sparse
on
what
the
garment
workers
do.
now
lastly,
we
think
that
one
consideration
that
has
to
come
before
the
courts
in
a
case
like
this
is,
what
the
potential
that
a
qualification
provides
incumbents
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
our
position
is
that
we
would
agree
that
experience
in
unions
as
in
any
public
office
is
a
very
desirable
quality
but
our
position
is
i
think
that
a
prior
office
holding
requirement
is
probably
not
the
way
of
doing
it.
now,
we
don't
take
that
per
se
position
in
this
case
because
there
are
so
many
other
factors
that
we
think
demonstrate
the
unreason
of
this
particular
requirement
in
this
union.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
but
we
would
also
point
out,
justice
brennan,
that
we
think
there's
a
considerable
cross-pollination
intended
between
this
provision
and
general
concepts
of
democracy
as
practiced
in
governmental
elections
here
and
i
must
say
that
this
is
quite
unusual
and
strange
type
of
requirement
for
elective
executive
position.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
secretary
has
not
yet,
i
think
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
that
would
be
impermissible
or
unallowable.
i
don't
think
that
he
believes
that
his
experience
in
administering
this
act
is
yet
so
complete
as
to
let
him
take
a
firm
black
or
white
position
on
that
question.
i
think
we
all
recognize
that
the
usual
means
of
securing
experience
or
competency
in
elections
as
to
trust
the
good
sense
of
the
electorate
and
certainly,
if
there's
one
thing
that's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
in
this
case.
it
would
seem
to
be
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
trust
the
good
sense
and
the
judgment
of
union
members
while
making
sure
that
they
have
the
experience
necessary
to
make
an
intelligent
and
informed
judgment
to
hear
from
the
knowledge
and
so
forth.
mr.
harris
weinstein
perhaps
but
there
are
many
ways
of
doing
it,
justice
white.
for
example
--
one
of
the
examples
that
the
other
side
points
to
here
where
they
tried
--
i
imagine
to
impeach
what
we
put
in
on
other
union's
experience
was
a
qualification
of
i
believe
one
local
--
of
a
building
maintenance
workers.
now,
what
they
had
was
a
requirement
and
this
is
i
think
on
page
587
of
the
transcript
which
is
unfortunately
not
printed
in
the
printed
record.
their
requirement,
as
i
understand
it,
posed
two
alternatives.
one
was
three
years
membership
within
the
union
and
the
other
was
having
been
an
officer
or
an
employee
of
some
other
union.
now,
here
is
a
wrinkle
on
prior
office
holding
that
i
don't
think
we're
quite
prepared
to
exclude
at
this
time
because
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
so,
as
i
say,
we
have
quite
consciously
taken
an
open-ended
position.
i
think
while
recognizing,
perhaps
the
logic
of
it
is
ultimately
that
the
secretary
will
decide
after
a
number
of
years
and
he
has
not
found
the
prior
office
holding
requirements.
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
--
i
guess
we're
not
prepared
to
reach
the
question
on
this
case.
we're
prepared
to
say
it
that
experience
generally
is
nice
to
have
in
officials
but
we
also
say
that
a
prior
restraint
on
candidacy
is
not
the
procedure
that
is
usually
used
to
exclude
the
inexperienced.
mr.
harris
weinstein
would
be
bad
did
you
say?
we
would
on
this
record
certainly.
mr.
harris
weinstein
nor
can
i,
justice
white.
i'm
simply
not
to
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
i
can't
think
of
any
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
deny
the
possibility
that
someone
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
is
impermissible
for
it
to
do
it
by
this
method
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
hmm?
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
not
by
this
procedure
that
excludes
so
many
in
this
way
and
makes
it
so
hard
for
any
opposition
to
mount
an
opposition
slate
to
contest
for
control
of
the
union.
now
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
testimony
of
the
--
the
testimony
of
the
union
president
is
that
it
can
be
changed
only
by
a
vote
of
the
assembly.
now,
the
amicus
brief,
i
believe,
says
that
it
can
be
changed
by
a
vote
of
the
general
membership
but
the
record
does
not
support
that
and
simply
according
to
this
record
which
there
can
be
changes
only
if
the
in
group
through
the
assembly
that
follows
the
recommendations
of
the
incumbents
desires
--
decides
to
vote
for
a
change.
i
would
think
though
that
even
if
the
union
majority
could
change
the
bylaw
and
that
wouldn't
be
enough
to
say
that.
this
statute
i
would
think
is
highly
concerned
with
the
rights
of
the
minority
and
no
matter
what
55%
of
the
union
might
do
to
the
qualifications
that
it
should
still
be
in
the
remaining
45%
i
think
a
very
real
right
that
they
have
a
real
possibility
of
mounting
whatever
opposition
they
want
and
putting
their
case
to
the
membership
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
would
have
serious
doubts
if
it's
reasonable--
mr.
harris
weinstein
precisely,
justice
brennan.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
fortas.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
in
terms
of
the
statute,
yes.
but
we
do
approach
this
case
with
a
view
that
given
the
word
reasonable,
the
first
step
is
to
determine
what
considerations
are
to
be
weighed
in
determining
whether
a
particular
qualification
is
reasonable
and
we
have
catalogued
this.
perhaps
the
court
will
not
find
it
necessary
to
consider
them
all
because
we
think
that
they
all
lead
to
remark
a
conclusion
of
unreasonableness
in
this
case.
i
certainly
agree
with
what
you
say
as
a
statement
of
the
issue
in
this
record.
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
agree.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
would
depend
on
what
the
length
of
membership
is.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
in
one
year
requirement
in
one
union
might
be
reasonable
where
in
another
union,
it
might
exclude
so
many
and
perhaps
it
wouldn't
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
what
percentage
of
people
they
exclude
from
running.
i
would
guess
that
it's
relatively
small
and
i
think
that
our
approach
to
a
case
of
that
sort
were
set
--
take
a
case
that
i
would
say
as
ambiguous
of
a
two-year
requirement.
i
believe
that
what
the
secretary
would
do
is
look
at
this
particular
union
and
make
a
judgment.
first,
in
examination
to
determine
how
many
people
are
excluded?
what
percentage
of
the
union
does
that
represent?
and
then
he
would
have
to
make
a
judgment
calling
on
his
own
expertness
and
experience
in
terms
of
whether
he
considers
that
probable
cause
for
reasonableness.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
union
was
described
as
having
a
high
turnover
rate
of
about
10%
a
year.
now,
putting
all
the
numbers
together,
the
suggestion
is
that
i
think
there's
a
large
base
that
stays
but
perhaps
10%
or
so
that
keeps
changing
over
each
year
and
perhaps
70%
to
80%
doesn't
turnover
at
all.
i
don't
think
it
means
that
in
five
years,
50%
turns
over.
but
out
answer
to
that
is,
i
don't
think
we're
prepared
at
this
stage
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
of
course
but
it
would
--
i
think
their
mootness
argument
presents
it
tangentially.
mr.
harris
weinstein
now,
the
last
thing
that
i
would
just
mention
is
another
reason
for
disqualifying
this
requirement
is
the
potential
that
it
presents
to
the
incumbents
for
staying
in
office.
the
district
court
found
here
that
it
just
wasn't
possible
to
be
elected
to
the
assembly
to
even
become
eligible
to
run
for
the
paid
office
except
with
the
blessing
of
the
incumbents.
whether
this
happened
or
not,
it
seems
to
us
that
once
a
requirement
has
that
kind
of
potential
and
this
one
does
because
of
the
slowness
with
which
people
would
become
qualified
for
office,
it
simply
cannot
be
called
reasonable.
turning
to
the
next
question,
the
problem
is
one
of
determining
effect
on
election.
the
statutory
language
is
402(c)
at
the
bottom
of
page
42.
and
it
says
that
before
ordering
a
supervised
election,
the
district
court
must
find
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
after
a
trial
upon
the
merits
that
a
violation
of
section
401
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
particular
election.
and
the
problem
here
i
think
is
stated
narrowly
in
terms
of
the
statute
is
what
does
the
phrase
‘may
have
affected'
mean
as
a
legal
matter.
this
phrase
is
the
product
of
a
compromised
in
the
congress.
it
was
not
in
the
bill
in
the
kennedy-ervin
bill
as
originally
proposed,
the
statute
read
essentially
as
it
does
without
may
have.
they're
required
of
finding
that
the
violation
of
section
401
affected
the
outcome.
the
senate
inserted
the
phrase
‘may
have’,
the
house
is
seated
to
it
in
conference
and
senator
goldwater
in
presenting
the
compromise
to
the
florida
senate,
commented
that
the
purpose
of
this
condition
--
this
language
‘may
have’
was
because
and
i
quote
that
the
difficulty
of
proving
such
an
actuality
that
is
an
actuality
of
effect
would
be
so
great
as
to
render
the
professed
remedy
practically
worthless
and
we
suggest
that
that
has
to
be
the
keynote
of
interpretation
and
application
of
the
provision
in
this
case.
we
would
suggest
that
the
moment
one
person
is
disqualified
from
running
for
office
by
an
unreasonable
requirement.
that
may
have
affected
the
outcome.
that
is
sufficient.
i
think
it's
a
common
knowledge
that
the
outcome
of
an
election
as
influenced
by
candidates
who
did
not
run
is
always
an
imponderable.
the
best
a
court
can
do
is
speculate.
perhaps
it
would
have
been
different,
perhaps
it
would
have
not.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
statute
and
here
where
eight
were
disqualified
by
this
requirement,
where
the
result
was
no
contest
for
the
vice
presidencies,
a
lesser
contest
for
the
general
officers,
a
contest
for
only
two
of
the
business
agent
positions.
it's
even
clearer
if
there
was
unnecessary
possibility
of
effect.
other
candidates
would
have
expanded
the
campaign
perhaps
have
different
personalities,
perhaps
things
would
have
turned
out
differently,
perhaps
they
would
have
not
but
in
our
position,
that
is
sufficient.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
correct,
justice
fortas
because
those
would
be
resolved
in
the
course
of
supervision.
our
position
on
that
point
however
is
that
essentially,
there
is
no
difference
in
thesis
between
this
case
and
the
laborer's
union
case
decided
earlier
this
term
because
we
can't
see
what
difference
it
makes,
what
complaint
is
made
to
the
secretary,
the
secretary
in
protecting
the
public
interest
is
empowered
to
investigate
broadly
and
we
assume
is
in
the
case
with
the
labor
board.
he
should
be
empowered
to
sue
upon
whatever
he
finds.
and
these
are
the
reasons
why
we
request
for
the
decision
below
be
reversed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
may
16th
is
the
date.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
so.
it
would
be
the
same
effect
as
the
two
cases
already
decided
this
term.
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
not
at
this
moment.
perhaps
he
will
but
he
has
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
not
as
of
this
moment.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
assume
to
the
southern
district
but
possibly
to
this
court
i
think
we
would
have
to
examine
that
question.
thanks
so
much.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
just
make
use
of
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
make
a
few
observations.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
i
may
just
make
a
few
observations
with
the
time
remaining.
first
in
reply
to
your
question
justice
white
at
the
--
in
the
record,
the
district
court's
opinion
at
page
297
makes
very
clear
that
no
one
in
his
view
could
be
elected
without
the
blessing
of
the
administration
party
and
not
finding
as
amply
supported
and
has
not
been
upset.
mr.
harris
weinstein
at
the
bottom
of
page
297,
mr.
justice
black,
there
is
a
paragraph
beginning
with
the
sentence,
“in
practice,
it
was
not
possible
to
be
elected
to
the
assembly
except
with
the
blessing
of
the
administration
party
conferred
by
selection
to
run
for
the
assembly
on
row
a.”
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
is
one
of
the
other
points
i
made
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court
looked
at
two
factors
that
are
really
not
permissible
under
this
legislation.
one
is,
is
this
a
good
union?
has
it
done
a
good
job
for
its
members?
should
the
union
members
be
happy?
can
we
justify
the
results
of
the
election
on
that
basis?
perhaps,
this
is
a
fine
administration.
perhaps
it
is
as
benevolent
as
they
say
it
but
it
would
seem
to
us
that
that
is
not
the
test
under
the
statute.
the
test
under
the
statute
is
whether
a
group
that
thinks
it
has
not
been
well-handled
or
just
things
that
can
do
a
better
job.
can
such
a
group
mount
on
the
--
within
the
procedures
allowed
in
opposition?
mr.
harris
weinstein
oh,
yes.
i
would
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
on
itself,
it
would
seem
is
not
coercive
but
the
way
what
the
district
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
what
the
district
judge
did
in
this
case
is
analyze
the
history
and
the
evidence
and
it
was
his
conclusion
which
i
don't
think
can
fairly
be
disagreed
with
that
over
the
span
from
1951
to
1965,
these
rules
worked
to
make
it
possible
for
the
in
group
to
maintain
control,
to
make
it
highly
difficult
for
an
out
group
to
get
a
leg
off.
now
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
is
pernicious
mr.
justice
white
when
the
out
group
is
unable
to
mount
the
campaign
and
put
its
test
to
the
members.
in
our
view
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
there's
never
been
a
fair
test.
mr.
harris
weinstein
there's
never
been
a
fair
test
to
that,
mr.
justice
white
when
the
--
i
think
when
the
record
shows
that
those
who
had
attempted
to
mount
an
opposition
slate
have
been
unable
to
do
so
because
of
this
prior
office
holding
requirement
and
we
would
suggest
that
if
there's
one
thing
that
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
is
that
congress
did
not
want
the
secretary
and
did
not
want
the
courts
inquiring
into
whether
into
question
such
of
this
which
i
would
say
posed
as
whether
a
union
member
ought
to
be
happy
with
what
he
was
getting.
rather
the
congress
as
we
see
it
intended
that
this
question
be
put
to
the
membership
and
open
elections
with
open
opportunity
to
campaign
with
freedom
for
any
dissident
group
to
mount
the
campaign
and
put
its
case
to
the
members
and
let
the
members
decide
whether
they
think
a
new
group
can
do
better
and
its
that
possibility
that
we
think
and
we
think
the
district
court
found
has
been
foreclosed
by
this
rule.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
know
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
for
this
reason,
justice
white.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
a
provision
where
the
best
you
can
do
is
speculate
on
its
effect.
now,
the
average
is
that
the
membership
party
was
defeated
by
a
margin
of
seven
to
one.
the
record
shows
for
example
though
that
there
were
contest
for
two
positions
of
business
agent,
one
of
them
lost
by
seven
to
one,
the
other
one
lost
by
a
little
over
three
to
one.
none
of
the
contest
that
the
membership
party
wanted
to
undertake
for
vice
president
ever
occurred.
the
other
contest,
i
think
six
other
contests
or
five
other
contests
of
business
agent
never
occurred.
now,
in
these
five
districts
where
there
was
no
contest,
we
say
that
the
margin
would
have
been
three
to
one
was
in
one
or
seven
to
one
because
it
was
in
another
district
or
would
it
be
three
to
two
or
perhaps
the
membership
party
might
have
won.
perhaps
they
might
have
won
if
they
had
run
a
vice
presidency.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
and
we
would
go
further
in
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
we
go
further
because
it
is
our
position
when
it
might
have
affected
a
candidate
and
you
do
not
know
who
could
have
come
forward.
that
too
has
an
affect
that
is
imponderable
and
just
simply
cannot
be
measured
by
a
court.
and
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
think
reasonably
probable
is
wrong
as
applied
to
this
record
because
it
requires
--
underlying
any
standard
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
general,
if
were
to
say
reasonably
possible.
yes,
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
slight
variation.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
if
were
seeking
a
general
session
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
brennan.
and
this
--
i
think
in
substance
--
in
our
brief.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
suggest
let's
say
in
the
case
where
the
winning
margin
is
a
thousand
votes
and
the
charge
is
that
a
hundred
ballots
were
destroyed
in
that
counting.
that's
the
case
where
we
should
not
prevail
under
this
test.
now,
it
seems
to
us
the
present
case
isn't
quite
the
other
extreme.
there
will
be
perhaps
harder
ones
that
we
would
agree
would
be
harder
that
fall
in
the
middle
but
it
seems
to
us
when
you
exclude
candidates,
when
we
all
know
that
the
outcome
of
any
election
depends
on
exposure,
on
personality,
on
a
number
of
troops
willing
to
bring
out
--
take
out
the
message
of
the
opposition
forces,
no
court
can
exclude
the
possibility,
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
result
might
have
been
different.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
hold
on
this
record
that
there
is
no
right
to
relief,
simply
rejects
this
change
in
language
that
was
made
in
the
congress
to
insert
these
words
‘may
have.’
it
comes
down
to
showing
an
outright
effect
and
this
is
what
we
think
and
ask
the
court
not
to
do.
thank
you.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
began
when
the
petitioner,
the
secretary
of
labor
sued
in
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
set
aside
an
election
that
the
respondent,
a
local
union
held
in
may
1965.
the
issues
arise
under
title
iv
of
the
labor
reform
law
of
1959
which
is
commonly
known
as
the
landrum-griffin
act.
as
the
court
knows,
the
scheme
of
that
title
is
to
set
forth
in
one
elaborate
section,
section
401,
a
variety
of
conditions
and
requirements
that
are
applied
to
the
union
elections.
the
first
issue
in
this
case
involves
one
of
those
requirements
drawing
out
of
a
provision
of
section
401(e)
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
towards
the
top
of
page
40.
that
provision,
section
401(e),
among
other
things
deals
with
qualifications
that
a
union
may
impose
upon
those
who
wish
to
be
candidates
for
elective
office.
and
it
says
that
all
members
in
good
standing
shall
be
eligible
subject
to
and
this
is
the
pertinent
statutory
language,
“reasonable
qualifications
uniformly
imposed.”
the
respondent
applied
what
the
district
judge
has
called
a
prior
office
holding
requirement.
it
required
those
who
wish
to
be
candidates
for
anyone
of
the
31
paid
full-time
positions
open
in
the
may
1965
election,
to
have
previously
been
members
of
the
body
of
the
union
called
its
assembly
which
existed
since
1951
or
instead
to
have
been
members
of
a
body
called
all
the
old
shop
delegates
council
which
existed
before
1951.
our
contention
which
the
district
court
accepted
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
is
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
requirement
within
the
intention
of
the
statute.
the
second
issue
before
the
court
grows
out
of
the
procedures
established
in
section
402
for
remedying
defective
elections.
that
section
sets
up
a
multistage
procedure.
the
union
member
who
is
dissatisfied
must
exhaust
internal
remedies.
he
complains
to
the
secretary,
the
secretary
investigates
and
then
if
he
thinks
it
warranted,
if
the
union
has
not
taken
voluntary
action,
he
bring
suit
to
set
aside
the
election
and
to
seek
the
relief
of
a
new
election
under
his
supervision.
the
second
problem
here
goes
to
the
conditions
the
statute
prescribes
as
the
requisite
to
the
grant
of
the
relief
of
a
new
election.
the
statutory
language
is
in
section
402(c)
which
is
towards
the
bottom
of
page
42
of
our
brief,
and
it
says
that
the
election
shall
not
be
set
aside
unless
the
district
court
finds
that
a
violation
of
section
401
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
the
district
court
here
held
that
even
though
the
prior
office
holding
requirement
wasn't
its
view
unreasonable,
it
could
not
say
that
the
imposition
of
that
requirement
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
we
contest
that
ruling
here
as
well.
there's
a
third
question
that
need
not
be
reached
if
the
first
two
are
answered
in
the
secretary's
favor.
and
this
was
a
question
akin
to
that
previously
decided
by
this
court
this
term
in
the
local
125
of
the
laborer's
union
case.
it
goes
to
the
relationship
that
must
exist
between
the
charges
the
secretary
makes
in
court
and
those
that
union
member
makes
in
his
complaint
to
the
secretary.
here,
the
union
members
complained
only
with
the
prior
office
holding
requirement,
both
within
the
union
and
to
the
secretary.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
correct,
justice
harlan.
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
resting
solely
on
that
second
question.
the
secretary
in
his
investigation
believed
he
had
uncovered
evidence
of
three
additional
violations
of
section
401
committed
in
connection
with
this
election
going
to
the
fact
that
some
officers
were
appointed
rather
than
elected
an
alleged
lack
of
timely
notice
of
election
districts
and
alleged
interference
with
voters
at
the
polls.
the
district
judge
struck
these
allegations
on
the
ground
that
the
union
members
have
not
complained
upon
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
there's
also
a
fourth
question
which
has
been
interposed,
i
believe,
for
the
first
time
in
respondent's
brief
in
this
court
and
we
have
not
dealt
with
it
in
our
brief
and
i
will
after
stating
the
facts
and
this
is
an
argument
that
because
the
respondent
has
changed
his
prior
office
holding
requirement
and
plans
to
hold
a
new
election
about
three
weeks
from
now
that
this
case
is
moot.
now,
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case
which
are
rather
complex
because
of
the
complex
organization
that
this
union
has
given
its
government.
the
union
represents,
at
least
to
the
time
of
the
may
1965
election,
approximately
27,000
people
employed
in
hotels,
motels
and
private
clubs
in
the
new
york
city
area.
i
believe
it
covered
all
boroughs
except
staten
island.
the
union
for
purposes
of
its
internal
government
is
divided
into
seven
districts.
six
of
these
are
geographic
and
each
of
the
geographic
districts
covers
all
of
the
hotels
and
motels
within
its
boundaries.
the
seventh
district
covers
all
of
the
private
clubs
within
the
union's
jurisdiction.
the
union,
both
with
--
the
union
as
a
whole
within
the
district's
--
within
each
hotel
or
motel
or
club
is
divided
into
departments
or
craft
units
and
there
are
basically
five
of
these.
the
housekeeping
workers,
the
kitchen
workers,
the
dining
room
workers,
the
banquet
workers
and
bar
workers,
each
have
a
department,
a
craft
organization.
and
then
within
each
hotel,
this
craft
organization
is
reflected
in
the
composition
of
the
shops.
each
dining
room
is
a
shop,
each
banquet
room,
each
bar
and
so
forth.
now,
the
general
organization
of
the
overall
government
of
the
union
is
somewhat
complex
and
the
hope
that
it
might
aid
rather
than
add
to
confusion,
i've
had
prepared
a
rather
summary
chart
of
the
union's
overall
government
and
ask
the
clerk
to
distribute
it
to
your
honors.
and
if
i
may
before
coming
back
to
the
craft
organization,
i'd
like
to
describe
the
people
who
are
listed
on
this
chart
and
how
they
are
chosen.
because
it
is
only
the
people
listed
on
this
chart
who,
since
1951,
have
been
eligible
to
run
for
the
full-time
paid
positions.
at
the
top
of
the
union,
their
major
officers
are
four
general
officers,
the
president,
the
secretary
treasure,
the
general
organizer
and
the
recording
secretary.
these
are
elected
by
the
membership
at
large.
next,
there
are
seven
vice
presidents
who
are
elected
from
the
seven
districts
that
i
mentioned
before.
one
from
each
and
each
vice
president
is
essentially
the
presiding
officer
of
his
district.
now,
there
is
a
provision
for
other
vice
presidents
to
be
appointed
by
the
assembly.
the
record
is
silent
on
when
this
provision
whether
this
provision
has
ever
been
invoked.
the
respondent
asserts
that
is
not
and
we
know
of
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
but
the
provision
is
intended
to
allow
other
vice
presidents
to
be
appointed
by
the
assembly
for
the
purpose
of
making
sure
that
there
is
at
least
one
vice
president
from
each
of
the
crafts.
then,
there
are
10
delegates
to
the
new
york
hotel
and
motel
trades
council.
these
are
appointed
from
the
--
by
and
from
the
assembly.
generally,
the
record
says,
they
also
hold
elective
positions.
the
trades
council
that
they
belong
to,
represents
a
multiple
of
unions
and
group
bargainings
with
the
hotels
and
motels
within
their
jurisdiction.
now,
those
who
i
have
mentioned
up
to
this
point
compose
the
administrative
board
of
the
union
and
the
union's
president
testified
below
that
these
are
the
people
who
on
a
day-to-day
basis
run
the
union.
now,
in
composing--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
can
vary
from
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
brennan.
i
didn't
intend
to
give
any
other
impression.
it
can
vary
up
to
21
but
our
understanding
is
it
is
not
and
it
could
be
as
few
as
11
if
all
10
were
either
vice
president
or
a
general
officer.
the
next
basic
group
in
the
union
is
the
executive
board
which
meets
on
a
monthly
basis
and
its
voting
members
constitute
the
members
of
the
administrative
board
plus
about
50
other
members.
these
50
other
members
are
chosen
from
the
overall
assembly
at
a
rate
of
one
man
for
every
500
union
members.
now,
in
1965,
27,000
union
members
would
have
meant
54
other
voting
members
of
the
administrative
board.
in
addition,
all
of
the
union's
business
agents
are
nonvoting
members
of
the
executive
board.
they
can
sit,
they
have
a
voice
but
they
do
not
vote.
20
business
agents
are
elected
and
i've
noticed
that
our
brief
in
page,
top
of
page
4
inadvertently
says
31
and
it
should
read
20
there.
they
are
elected
from
the
seven
districts
into
which
the
union
is
divided.
in
addition,
the
assembly
may
appoint
as
many
other
business
agents
as
it
thinks
desirable
or
necessary.
while
the
record
shows
that
some
other
had
been
appointed,
it
does
not
show
the
précised
number.
these
people,
together
with
all
elected
assembly
--
other
assembly
members,
compose
the
union's
assembly,
the
basic
body
that
makes
a
man
eligible
to
run
for
office.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
began
--
the
basic
plan,
as
it
now
exist,
mr.
justice
harlan
began
in
1951.
there
was
previously
a
body
called
the
shop
delegates
council
which
filled
the
function
of
the
assembly.
now,
it
may
be
that
there
was
also
an
executive
board
and
administrative
board
at
that
time
but
before
1951,
as
i
should
come
in
a
moment
if
i
may,
what
a
man
had
to
do
to
become
eligible
to
run
for
office
is
somewhat
different
than
he's
had
to
do
since
1951.
these
other
assembly
members
are
approximately
325,
350.
there
are
about
a
total
of
400
assembly
members
including
the
50
who
sit
on
the
executive
board.
they
are
chosen
from
one,
two
or
three
election
districts
within
each
of
the
seven
districts
at
a
rate
of
one
assembly
man
for
each
75
union
members.
now,
the
full-time
paid
positions
on
this
chart
are
essentially
three
groups,
which
are
four
general
officers,
seven
vice
presidencies,
the
20
business
agents.
a
person
who
wished
to
run
for
one
of
those
offices
in
may
1965
had
to
satisfy
the
prior
office
holding
requirement.
he
did
not
have
to
satisfy
that
requirement
to
be
appointed
say
as
an
additional
business
agent
or
to
run
for
any
of
the
other
positions
listed
here.
now,
the
union
as
well,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
has
a
craft
structure.
each
shop
within
each
hotel
or
motel
or
club,
at
least
i
think
it
has
five
or
more
members,
elects
its
own
representative
called
the
‘shop
delegate'
or
the
‘department
delegate'
variously,
who
fills
the
function
of
shop
steward.
he
is
essentially
the
leader
of
that
shop.
before
1951,
there
was
a
group
that
is
now
referred
to
as
the
old
shops
delegate
council.
every
shop
delegate
or
steward
who
held
such
a
position
before
1951
belong
to
that
council.
however,
when
the
assembly
was
created,
shop
--
being
a
shop
delegate
did
not
qualify
one
for
the
assembly.
so
in
consequence,
if
a
man
was
a
shop
delegate
or
steward
before
1951,
he
is
eligible
to
run
for
one
of
the
full-time
paid
positions.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
has
had
that
position
since
1951
and
only
since
1951,
that
does
not
give
him
eligibility
for
paid
position.
the
shop
delegates,
the
stewards
however,
have
a
variety
of
functions
within
the
union.
for
example
they
process
grievances
at
initial
levels.
they
also
represent
the
shop
members
a
variety
of
functions
in
the
union.
they
engage
in
the
shop
committee
which
is
a
group
of
all
people,
all
shop
delegates
and
i
believe
assembly
members
from
within
a
hotel.
they
participate
on
a
district
council;
the
body
which
the
bylaw
says
governs
that
--
one
of
the
seven
districts.
they,
together
with
the
vice
president,
the
business
agents
and
the
assembly
members
from
that
district
meet
together
and
govern
the
district.
and
then
both
on
a
district
basis
and
a
union
wide
basis,
they
participate
in
so-called
department
activities.
these
are
meetings
for
example
of
all
kitchen
delegates
or
all
banquet
delegates
which
focus
on
problems
that
in
--
peculiarly
of
one
trade.
the
union
president
also
testified
at
page
52
of
the
record
that
they
do
a
great
many
of
the
things
in
a
day-to-day
operation
of
the
union.
one
example
was
participation
in
the
social
services
the
union
gives
and
another
example
was
participation
in
legislative
lobbying
type
activities.
the
1965
election
was
the
fifth
that
the
union
has
had
since
1951.
there
had
been
apparently
considerable
opposition
in
1951
and
perhaps
two
or
three
complete
slates.
but
between
1951
and
1965,
there
was
no
organized
opposition
to
the
incumbents.
there
was
a
smattering
from
time
to
time.
one
election
was
dispensed
with
for
a
lack
of
opposition
but
all
of
the
others
were
held.
the
opponents
to
the
incumbents
were
overwhelmingly
defeated
in
each
of
these
intervening
elections.
and
in
each
of
these
elections
including
1965,
one
full
slate
was
offered,
called
the
‘administration
party'
and
appeared
on
the
first
row
of
the
voting
machine.
the
persons
who
were
on
that
slate
were
chosen
by
the
caucuses
called
by
the
incumbents
and
attended
by
union
members
selected
by
the
incumbents
and
this
is
what
it
has
been
called,
the
‘administration
party'.
in
1965,
the
‘membership
party'
was
formed.
it
was
the
first
organized
opposition
to
the
administration
party
since
1951.
it
sought
to
mount
a
slate
that
while
not
complete
perhaps
was
substantially
so
at
least
for
the
full-time
positions.
they
sought
to
offer
a
candidate
for
each
of
the
four
general
officers
for
five
of
the
seven
vice
presidencies,
for
eight
of
the
20
business
agent
positions.
they
also
offered
ten
--
these
that
i've
just
mentioned,
the
general
officers,
the
vice
presidency,
the
business
agents
are
all
subject
to
the
prior
office
holding
requirement.
they
also
offered
15
candidates
for
other
positions
to
which
this
requirement
did
not
apply.
and
these
were
for
10
delegates
to
the
international
convention
of
this
union.
there
were
ten
positions
open.
and
then
they
offered
five
candidates
for
the
370
odd
open
positions
on
the
assembly.
the
application
of
the
prior
office
holding
requirement
meant
that
eight
of
the
17
who
wish
to
run
for
the
full-time
positions
were
disqualified.
others
were
disqualified
for
failure
to
meet
a
requirement
that
is
not
an
issue
here,
that
a
candidate
be
union
member
for
two
years
in
good
standing
before
the
election.
mr.
harris
weinstein
justice
harlan,
of
the
27,000
union
members,
approximately
--
i
think
the
number
was
1,725.
about
6%
or
7%
of
the
membership
were
eligible
to
run.
now,
of
that
1,725,
1,100
gained
their
eligibility
for
membership
on
the
old
shops
delegate
council
before
1951.
of
the
remainder
several
hundred
of
course
were
on
the
administration
party
slate
in
this
election
are
taken
at
the
most.
there
are
1,700
taken
at
the
least,
there
are
a
few
hundred.
our
position
is
that
whatever
it
is,
7%
of
the
total
membership
is
just
too
few
to
be
reasonable.
now,
the
net
result
in
this
election
was
that
the
membership
party
ran
two
candidates
for
general
officer;
these
were
for
president
and
general
organizer.
no
candidates
for
vice
president
and
two
candidates
for
business
agents.
they
also
ran
eight
people
as
delegates
to
the
international
convention
and
two
as
delegates
to
the
assembly.
in
the
election,
about
11,000
and
40%
of
the
union
membership
voted
where
there
was
opposition,
the
membership
party
lost
by
a
margin
averaging
seven
to
one.
now,
if
i
may
first
turn
to
the
problem
of
mootness.
as
i
indicated
before,
this
argument
is
based
on
two
facts.
one
is
that
there
is
a
new
bylaw
that
was
adopted
i
believe
in
december
1966
just
prior
to
the
trial
on
this
case.
it
adds
to
the
qualifications
for
office.
those
who
have
served
as
shop
delegates
since
1951
and
any
other
person
who
has
been
a
union
member
for
at
least
five
years
at
the
time
of
election
and
the
contention
seems
to
be
that
in
respondent's
view,
this
is
plainly
a
proper
requirement
and
second,
there's
going
to
be
a
new
election
with
this
allegedly
proper
requirement
and
so
there's
no
need
for
the
courts
to
proceed
any
further.
mr.
harris
weinstein
justice
brennan,
i
found
nothing
in
the
record.
they
say
that
it
adds
about
14,000
or
15,000
that
they
are16,000
or
17,000
who
are
now
eligible.
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
would
probably
be.
we
don't
--
i
doubt
that
anything
like
that
number
would
have
been
members
of
the
--
let's
say
would
have
had
the
function
stewards.
however,
for
reasons
that
are
not
clear
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
we
think
that's
a
reasonable
requirement
and
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
judge
from
the
evidence
of
turnover
on
this
record
that
16,000
or
17,000
is
probably
a
close
approximation
of
those
who
had
been
in
the
union
for
five
years
and
i
would
--
mr.
cohn
would
be
more
up
on
this
than
i
but
i
would
assume
a
relatively
small
number
though
is
qualified
by
reason
of
being
stewards
or
shop
owners.
but
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
that's
correct.
and
again,
that
would
be
perhaps
a
smaller
number.
but
i'd
like
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
have
also
amended
their
bylaws
to
change
the
appointment
provisions
and
although
that
allegation
was
stricken
from
the
complaint,
i
understand
that
they
have
--
and
again,
i'm
not
sure
that
this
is
in
the
record
that
they
have
changed
that
appointment
provision
in
a
manner
that
it
would
have
been
demanded
in
a
supervised
election.
but
this
new
requirement,
this
new
bylaw
for
reasons
that
are
not
quite
clear
from
the
face
of
that
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
did
say
that
in
his
view,
this
was
an
unreasonable
requirement
and
that
matter
as
best
as
i
can
tell
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
would
not
think
that
it's
appropriate
in
this
court
to
be
arguing
that
it
is
clearly
a
legal
one
but
whether
it
is
or
not,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
doesn't
moot
the
case
for
the
reasons
that
this
court
set
out
in
the
decisions
earlier
this
year.
the
congressional
concern
that
this
court
talked
about
there
was
that
incumbents
once
having
come
in
to
office
unlawfully,
should
not
be
allowed
the
opportunity
to
perpetuate
themselves
an
office
by
some
improper
procedure.
the
public
interest,
as
we
understand
those
decisions,
requires
a
laboratory
type
of
election
under
the
secretary's
supervision
to
guarantee
that
there
is
no
future
violation
and
we
would
think
that
whatever
the
violation,
whatever
the
union
does
in
an
attempt
to
cleanse
itself
after
a
suit
begins,
this
just
doesn't
moot
the
secretary's
demand
for
a
supervised
election.
of
course
in
this
case,
we
think
it
even
less
appropriate
mootness
when
the
new
bylaw
has
been
called
unreasonable
by
the
district
judge
and
where
one
of
the
allegations
stricken
from
the
complaint
was
a
charge
of
improper
conduct
are
proposed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
once
the
suit
begins,
we
would
say
that
the
union's
opportunity
for
self
cleansing
ends
when
the
suit
is
final.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
but
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
assume
that
he
can
always
settle
his
litigation
but
i
don't
know
that
on
what
terms
that
would
be
done
but
at
least
the
union
cannot
control
of
the
case
away
from
the
courts
or
from
the
plaintiff.
turning
to
the
issue
of
reasonableness,
the
statutory
word
of
course
is
a
very
flexible
one
and
i
imagine
that
in
theory,
it
could
be
given
a
variety
of
meanings.
reasonableness,
i
assume,
means
different
things
in
different
context
depending
on
the
purposes
that
the
congress
or
the
legislature
had
in
mind.
i
don't
think
that
either
of
the
courts
below
stated
a
generalized
interpretation
that
they
thought
would
be
pertinent.
the
respondent
here
in
the
amicus
the
aflcio,
offer
an
articulation
which
i
think
is
the
worthwhile
starting
point
for
discussion
of
the
problem.
they
speak
of
reasonable
meaning
that
a
union
may
seek
what
they
call
a
legitimate
and/or
objective
by
any
rational
or
appropriate
means.
i
don't
--
those
words
of
course,
i
don't
think,
could
solve
the
problem
because
whatever
reasonable
it
may
mean,
i
don't
know
that
it's
anymore
clear
what
legitimate
means
or
what
rational
or
what
appropriate
means.
but
i
assume
what
they
mean
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
this
case
is
that
a
union
may
seek
by
a
rule
to
eliminate
people
without
experience
from
being
candidates
and
that
any
rule
that
is
logically
calculated
to
eliminate
the
inexperienced
is
a
reasonable
one
or
appropriate
one
under
the
statute.
the
case
i
guess
could
be
disposed
of
on
their
grounds
because
the
facts,
i
don't
think,
would
meet
their
standards.
for
example,
we
would
say
there's
nothing
rational
in
a
qualification
that
allows
1,100
people
to
run
for
office
when
their
experience
antedates
1951
or
that
excludes
from
running
from
office
al
of
those
people
who
have
been
shop
delegates
since
1951
and
who
on
the
union
president's
own
description
in
his
testimony
seem
to
have
very
little
in
the
way
of
experience
that's
materially
different
from
that
which
the
average
assembly
then
gets.
that
assembly
on
this
record
meets
four
times
a
year.
three
of
those
times
for
two
hours
or
three
hours
and
once
for
all
day.
the
record
shows
that
the
attendance
is
very
sparse
if
the
union
applied
its
own
rule
that
would
eject
any
assembly
member
who
missed
two
consecutive
meetings.
the
record
shows
that
some
two
thirds
of
the
assembly
members
would
have
been
eliminated
from
the
assembly.
yet
all
these
assembly
members
are
eligible
to
run
while
the
shop
delegates
whom
the
union
president
described
as
being
active
in
a
day-to-day
operation
of
business
unit
affairs
are
not
eligible.
we
suggest
that
that
just
cannot
need
any
test
that
they
describe
as
requiring
rationality.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
no
restriction
at
all
on
appointment.
now,
appointment
they
say
means
election
by
the
assembly.
but
in
practice,
the
union
president
testified
that
he
couldn't
remember
anytime
an
assembly
--
the
assembly
rejected
any
recommendation
of
the
other
bodies
and
i
assume
that
goes
to
appointments
of
business
agents
as
well.
the
record
shows
for
example
that
the
union
ran
a
class
in
the
early
‘60s
with
about
a
hundred
union
members
attended.
the
union
administration
then
selected
about
a
dozen
for
further
training
and
then
at
least
several
of
them
were
appointed
business
agents.
none
of
them
at
least
the
two
appointments
that
we're
going
into
in
this
record,
neither
of
these
people
having
satisfy
the
prior
office
holding
requirement.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
in
fact,
the
record
shows
that
one
of
these
two
people
who
is
discussed,
one
of
them
was
appointed
before
the
1962
election
at
least.
he
did
not
run
in
the
1962
election
but
he
was
then
reappointed
as
business
agent.
he
then
run
and
was
elected
in
the
1965
election.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
case
can
be
disposed
of
so
readily
because
we
think
the
legal
standard
that
the
respondent
in
the
amicus
suggests
they're
simply
wrong
but
it
doesn't
reflect
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
requiring
only
reasonable
qualifications.
the
purpose
as
congress
has
said
repeatedly
and
this
court
has
said
of
title
iv
is
to
assure
democratic
procedures
in
the
government
of
unions.
it's
to
assure
that
union
officers
periodically
must
go
back
to
the
membership
for
a
mandate
and
that
the
membership
had
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
contest
with
the
incumbents.
and
we
suggest
that
any
approach
to
this
case
has
got
to
be
bottomed
on
a
recognition
that
the
essential
governing
feature
has
got
to
be
“what
is
the
freedom
of
choice
open
to
the
union
members
who
wish
to
oppose.”
is
it
reasonably
possible
for
any
opposition
group
within
the
union
to
mount
an
opposition
slate
and
put
the
choice
to
the
good
sense
and
the
good
judgment
of
the
union
electorate
during
and
after
a
campaign?
in
approaching
these
cases
with
this
thesis,
the
secretary
has
developed
a
variety
of
criteria
in
his
administration
that
he
has
proposed
to
the
courts
as
a
foundation
for
decision
of
these
cases.
and
the
courts
until
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
have
generally
agreed
that
these
are
the
pertinent
condition,
the
things
to
be
considered
in
determining
reasonableness.
first,
because
of
the
congressional
emphasis
of
what
is
democratic
and
what
is
not
and
that
this
election
should
be
democratic,
the
secretary
has
advanced
the
idea
that
a
principle
reference
must
be
made
to
those
conditions
that
are
opposed
in
the
polity
of
country
generally.
in
sense,
what
sorts
of
requirements
are
generally
accepted
in
democratic
elections
as
they're
known
here?
now,
we
would
think
that
on
this
basis,
it's
doubtful
that
any
prior
office
holding
requirement
can
be
upheld.
it's
just
too
foreign
to
the
type
of
procedures
that
american
democracy
has
developed.
but
we
don't
make
the
argument
that
such
a
per
se
rule
should
be
adopted
and
we
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
for
the
disposition
of
this
case.
for
example,
there's
a
variety
of
other
criteria
that
we
have
advanced
and
the
courts
have
considered
and
under
all
of
them,
we
think
that
the
union
requirement
in
this
case
has
to
be
disapproved.
as
i
indicated
before
in
response
to
justice
harlan,
the
requirement
in
this
case
disqualifies
some
93%
or
94%
of
the
union
membership
from
running
for
office.
with
this
type
of
disqualification
when
of
the
7%
such
a
substantial
number
have
not
been
active
in
the
assembly
or
the
general
government
since
1951
when
another
large
group
is
taken
up
by
the
administration
slate
in
this
or
any
other
election
because
incumbents
are
--
a
large
number
of
incumbents
are
generally
re-nominated.
how
possibly
can
there
be
any
assurance
that
a
group
within
the
union
that
wishes
to
oppose
can
find
candidates
who
will
be
allowed
to
run?
they
simply
cannot
when
the
restriction
is
this
substantial
and
we
suggest
that
this
too
makes
it
unreasonable.
now,
another
factor
which
we
advance
is
what
the
general
practice
in
the
labor
community.
the
secretary
introduced
in
the
district
court
a
substantial
amount
of
evidence
going
to
the
practices
of
unions
generally
and
there
are
several
exhibits
beginning
in
this
record.
i
believe
with
exhibit
69
at
page
249
that
analyzes
unions
in
this
country
by
factors
that
were
thought
to
make
them
in
some
way
comparable
to
local
sets.
for
example,
exhibit
69
analyzes
the
120
at
large
unions
in
the
same
business,
the
local
unions
and
respondents
owned
international.
and
it
show
that
only
about
25%
if
them
have
this
sort
of
requirement.
and
then
when
we
go
onto
the
other
comparisons,
the
requirement
becomes
even
less
frequent.
for
example,
exhibit
70
analyzed
international
unions
and
this
begins
on
page
258
of
the
record,
international
unions
having
a
total
membership
of
20,000
to
40,000
people.
and
this
group
was
chosen
because
the
20,000
to
40,000
range
was
somewhat
comparable
to
the
27,000
members
and
respondents
roles
and
not
a
single
one
of
the
unions
in
that
category
had
any
requirement
of
this
nature.
then
exhibit
71
which
begins
on
exhibit
--
on
page
260
analyzed
the
constitutions
of
the
major
national
unions
in
this
county.
it
analyzed
those
constitutions
of
72
of
these
unions,
i
believe,
to
determine
whether
a
private
--
a
prior
office
holding
requirement
was
imposed
on
the
locals
within
the
union.
the
only
such
requirement
that
was
found
was
in
the
international
ladies
garment
workers
union
and
that
union
offered
an
alternative
to
prior
office
holding
which
was
of
course
sponsored
by
the
union
and
union
management
that
as
far
as
we
know
from
this
record
was
open
to
all
and
everyone
who
took
the
course
became
eligible
to
run.
but
as
this
exhibit
shows
many
locals
with
membership
roles,
comparable
to
these
unions,
larger
than
these
unions
had
no
such
requirement,
it
just
didn't
any
need
for
it.
and
the
final
comparison
put
in
before
the
district
court
which
begins
on
page
260
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
it's
the
next
class
on
page
266,
analyzed
national
unions
and
found
again
with
the
exception
of
the
ladies
garment
workers,
there
was
no
requirement.
i
believe
that
i
misspoke
myself
in
describing
exhibit
71.
one
of
the
criteria
for
selection
of
large
unions
there
were
the
receipts
and
these
unions
not
only
are
large
in
membership
but
they
are
believed
to
be
the
locals
in
the
country
that
have
receipts
in
excess
of
$1
million,
thus,
making
them
in
financial
size
and
presumably
a
need
for
financial
judgment
comparable
to
this
union.
so
that
in
total,
the
evidence
showed
quite
overwhelmingly,
we
think,
that
this
type
of
requirement
is
a
very
rare
beast
indeed
within
the
labor
movement
itself,
existing
only
within
a
few
locals
of
this
international
and
within
the
international
ladies
garment
workers
union
which
has
the
alternative
and
the
only
other
thing
comparable
to
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
attendance
at
a
training
class.
now,
i
think
there
is
rather
interesting
contrast
because
there
was
one
training
class
held
in
this
union
in
the
early
60s
but
those
who
took
it
did
not
become
eligible
for
--
to
run
for
office
unless
they
were
selected
by
the
incumbents
to
take
further
training
and
were
then
appointed
by
the
assembly
as
on
the
recommendation
of
the
economist
of
course
as
business
agents.
whereas
we
understand
the
garment
workers
union,
you
become
eligible
simply
by
showing
up
with
the
course
and
taking
it.
but
the
record
is
a
bit
sparse
on
what
the
garment
workers
do.
now
lastly,
we
think
that
one
consideration
that
has
to
come
before
the
courts
in
a
case
like
this
is,
what
the
potential
that
a
qualification
provides
incumbents
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
our
position
is
that
we
would
agree
that
experience
in
unions
as
in
any
public
office
is
a
very
desirable
quality
but
our
position
is
i
think
that
a
prior
office
holding
requirement
is
probably
not
the
way
of
doing
it.
now,
we
don't
take
that
per
se
position
in
this
case
because
there
are
so
many
other
factors
that
we
think
demonstrate
the
unreason
of
this
particular
requirement
in
this
union.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
but
we
would
also
point
out,
justice
brennan,
that
we
think
there's
a
considerable
cross-pollination
intended
between
this
provision
and
general
concepts
of
democracy
as
practiced
in
governmental
elections
here
and
i
must
say
that
this
is
quite
unusual
and
strange
type
of
requirement
for
elective
executive
position.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
secretary
has
not
yet,
i
think
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
that
would
be
impermissible
or
unallowable.
i
don't
think
that
he
believes
that
his
experience
in
administering
this
act
is
yet
so
complete
as
to
let
him
take
a
firm
black
or
white
position
on
that
question.
i
think
we
all
recognize
that
the
usual
means
of
securing
experience
or
competency
in
elections
as
to
trust
the
good
sense
of
the
electorate
and
certainly,
if
there's
one
thing
that's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
in
this
case.
it
would
seem
to
be
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
trust
the
good
sense
and
the
judgment
of
union
members
while
making
sure
that
they
have
the
experience
necessary
to
make
an
intelligent
and
informed
judgment
to
hear
from
the
knowledge
and
so
forth.
mr.
harris
weinstein
perhaps
but
there
are
many
ways
of
doing
it,
justice
white.
for
example
--
one
of
the
examples
that
the
other
side
points
to
here
where
they
tried
--
i
imagine
to
impeach
what
we
put
in
on
other
union's
experience
was
a
qualification
of
i
believe
one
local
--
of
a
building
maintenance
workers.
now,
what
they
had
was
a
requirement
and
this
is
i
think
on
page
587
of
the
transcript
which
is
unfortunately
not
printed
in
the
printed
record.
their
requirement,
as
i
understand
it,
posed
two
alternatives.
one
was
three
years
membership
within
the
union
and
the
other
was
having
been
an
officer
or
an
employee
of
some
other
union.
now,
here
is
a
wrinkle
on
prior
office
holding
that
i
don't
think
we're
quite
prepared
to
exclude
at
this
time
because
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
so,
as
i
say,
we
have
quite
consciously
taken
an
open-ended
position.
i
think
while
recognizing,
perhaps
the
logic
of
it
is
ultimately
that
the
secretary
will
decide
after
a
number
of
years
and
he
has
not
found
the
prior
office
holding
requirements.
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
--
i
guess
we're
not
prepared
to
reach
the
question
on
this
case.
we're
prepared
to
say
it
that
experience
generally
is
nice
to
have
in
officials
but
we
also
say
that
a
prior
restraint
on
candidacy
is
not
the
procedure
that
is
usually
used
to
exclude
the
inexperienced.
mr.
harris
weinstein
would
be
bad
did
you
say?
we
would
on
this
record
certainly.
mr.
harris
weinstein
nor
can
i,
justice
white.
i'm
simply
not
to
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
i
can't
think
of
any
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
deny
the
possibility
that
someone
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
is
impermissible
for
it
to
do
it
by
this
method
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
hmm?
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
not
by
this
procedure
that
excludes
so
many
in
this
way
and
makes
it
so
hard
for
any
opposition
to
mount
an
opposition
slate
to
contest
for
control
of
the
union.
now
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
testimony
of
the
--
the
testimony
of
the
union
president
is
that
it
can
be
changed
only
by
a
vote
of
the
assembly.
now,
the
amicus
brief,
i
believe,
says
that
it
can
be
changed
by
a
vote
of
the
general
membership
but
the
record
does
not
support
that
and
simply
according
to
this
record
which
there
can
be
changes
only
if
the
in
group
through
the
assembly
that
follows
the
recommendations
of
the
incumbents
desires
--
decides
to
vote
for
a
change.
i
would
think
though
that
even
if
the
union
majority
could
change
the
bylaw
and
that
wouldn't
be
enough
to
say
that.
this
statute
i
would
think
is
highly
concerned
with
the
rights
of
the
minority
and
no
matter
what
55%
of
the
union
might
do
to
the
qualifications
that
it
should
still
be
in
the
remaining
45%
i
think
a
very
real
right
that
they
have
a
real
possibility
of
mounting
whatever
opposition
they
want
and
putting
their
case
to
the
membership
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
would
have
serious
doubts
if
it's
reasonable--
mr.
harris
weinstein
precisely,
justice
brennan.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
fortas.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
in
terms
of
the
statute,
yes.
but
we
do
approach
this
case
with
a
view
that
given
the
word
reasonable,
the
first
step
is
to
determine
what
considerations
are
to
be
weighed
in
determining
whether
a
particular
qualification
is
reasonable
and
we
have
catalogued
this.
perhaps
the
court
will
not
find
it
necessary
to
consider
them
all
because
we
think
that
they
all
lead
to
remark
a
conclusion
of
unreasonableness
in
this
case.
i
certainly
agree
with
what
you
say
as
a
statement
of
the
issue
in
this
record.
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
agree.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
would
depend
on
what
the
length
of
membership
is.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
in
one
year
requirement
in
one
union
might
be
reasonable
where
in
another
union,
it
might
exclude
so
many
and
perhaps
it
wouldn't
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
what
percentage
of
people
they
exclude
from
running.
i
would
guess
that
it's
relatively
small
and
i
think
that
our
approach
to
a
case
of
that
sort
were
set
--
take
a
case
that
i
would
say
as
ambiguous
of
a
two-year
requirement.
i
believe
that
what
the
secretary
would
do
is
look
at
this
particular
union
and
make
a
judgment.
first,
in
examination
to
determine
how
many
people
are
excluded?
what
percentage
of
the
union
does
that
represent?
and
then
he
would
have
to
make
a
judgment
calling
on
his
own
expertness
and
experience
in
terms
of
whether
he
considers
that
probable
cause
for
reasonableness.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
union
was
described
as
having
a
high
turnover
rate
of
about
10%
a
year.
now,
putting
all
the
numbers
together,
the
suggestion
is
that
i
think
there's
a
large
base
that
stays
but
perhaps
10%
or
so
that
keeps
changing
over
each
year
and
perhaps
70%
to
80%
doesn't
turnover
at
all.
i
don't
think
it
means
that
in
five
years,
50%
turns
over.
but
out
answer
to
that
is,
i
don't
think
we're
prepared
at
this
stage
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
of
course
but
it
would
--
i
think
their
mootness
argument
presents
it
tangentially.
mr.
harris
weinstein
now,
the
last
thing
that
i
would
just
mention
is
another
reason
for
disqualifying
this
requirement
is
the
potential
that
it
presents
to
the
incumbents
for
staying
in
office.
the
district
court
found
here
that
it
just
wasn't
possible
to
be
elected
to
the
assembly
to
even
become
eligible
to
run
for
the
paid
office
except
with
the
blessing
of
the
incumbents.
whether
this
happened
or
not,
it
seems
to
us
that
once
a
requirement
has
that
kind
of
potential
and
this
one
does
because
of
the
slowness
with
which
people
would
become
qualified
for
office,
it
simply
cannot
be
called
reasonable.
turning
to
the
next
question,
the
problem
is
one
of
determining
effect
on
election.
the
statutory
language
is
402(c)
at
the
bottom
of
page
42.
and
it
says
that
before
ordering
a
supervised
election,
the
district
court
must
find
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
after
a
trial
upon
the
merits
that
a
violation
of
section
401
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
particular
election.
and
the
problem
here
i
think
is
stated
narrowly
in
terms
of
the
statute
is
what
does
the
phrase
‘may
have
affected'
mean
as
a
legal
matter.
this
phrase
is
the
product
of
a
compromised
in
the
congress.
it
was
not
in
the
bill
in
the
kennedy-ervin
bill
as
originally
proposed,
the
statute
read
essentially
as
it
does
without
may
have.
they're
required
of
finding
that
the
violation
of
section
401
affected
the
outcome.
the
senate
inserted
the
phrase
‘may
have’,
the
house
is
seated
to
it
in
conference
and
senator
goldwater
in
presenting
the
compromise
to
the
florida
senate,
commented
that
the
purpose
of
this
condition
--
this
language
‘may
have’
was
because
and
i
quote
that
the
difficulty
of
proving
such
an
actuality
that
is
an
actuality
of
effect
would
be
so
great
as
to
render
the
professed
remedy
practically
worthless
and
we
suggest
that
that
has
to
be
the
keynote
of
interpretation
and
application
of
the
provision
in
this
case.
we
would
suggest
that
the
moment
one
person
is
disqualified
from
running
for
office
by
an
unreasonable
requirement.
that
may
have
affected
the
outcome.
that
is
sufficient.
i
think
it's
a
common
knowledge
that
the
outcome
of
an
election
as
influenced
by
candidates
who
did
not
run
is
always
an
imponderable.
the
best
a
court
can
do
is
speculate.
perhaps
it
would
have
been
different,
perhaps
it
would
have
not.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
statute
and
here
where
eight
were
disqualified
by
this
requirement,
where
the
result
was
no
contest
for
the
vice
presidencies,
a
lesser
contest
for
the
general
officers,
a
contest
for
only
two
of
the
business
agent
positions.
it's
even
clearer
if
there
was
unnecessary
possibility
of
effect.
other
candidates
would
have
expanded
the
campaign
perhaps
have
different
personalities,
perhaps
things
would
have
turned
out
differently,
perhaps
they
would
have
not
but
in
our
position,
that
is
sufficient.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
correct,
justice
fortas
because
those
would
be
resolved
in
the
course
of
supervision.
our
position
on
that
point
however
is
that
essentially,
there
is
no
difference
in
thesis
between
this
case
and
the
laborer's
union
case
decided
earlier
this
term
because
we
can't
see
what
difference
it
makes,
what
complaint
is
made
to
the
secretary,
the
secretary
in
protecting
the
public
interest
is
empowered
to
investigate
broadly
and
we
assume
is
in
the
case
with
the
labor
board.
he
should
be
empowered
to
sue
upon
whatever
he
finds.
and
these
are
the
reasons
why
we
request
for
the
decision
below
be
reversed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
may
16th
is
the
date.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
so.
it
would
be
the
same
effect
as
the
two
cases
already
decided
this
term.
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
not
at
this
moment.
perhaps
he
will
but
he
has
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
not
as
of
this
moment.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
assume
to
the
southern
district
but
possibly
to
this
court
i
think
we
would
have
to
examine
that
question.
thanks
so
much.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
just
make
use
of
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
make
a
few
observations.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
i
may
just
make
a
few
observations
with
the
time
remaining.
first
in
reply
to
your
question
justice
white
at
the
--
in
the
record,
the
district
court's
opinion
at
page
297
makes
very
clear
that
no
one
in
his
view
could
be
elected
without
the
blessing
of
the
administration
party
and
not
finding
as
amply
supported
and
has
not
been
upset.
mr.
harris
weinstein
at
the
bottom
of
page
297,
mr.
justice
black,
there
is
a
paragraph
beginning
with
the
sentence,
“in
practice,
it
was
not
possible
to
be
elected
to
the
assembly
except
with
the
blessing
of
the
administration
party
conferred
by
selection
to
run
for
the
assembly
on
row
a.”
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
is
one
of
the
other
points
i
made
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court
looked
at
two
factors
that
are
really
not
permissible
under
this
legislation.
one
is,
is
this
a
good
union?
has
it
done
a
good
job
for
its
members?
should
the
union
members
be
happy?
can
we
justify
the
results
of
the
election
on
that
basis?
perhaps,
this
is
a
fine
administration.
perhaps
it
is
as
benevolent
as
they
say
it
but
it
would
seem
to
us
that
that
is
not
the
test
under
the
statute.
the
test
under
the
statute
is
whether
a
group
that
thinks
it
has
not
been
well-handled
or
just
things
that
can
do
a
better
job.
can
such
a
group
mount
on
the
--
within
the
procedures
allowed
in
opposition?
mr.
harris
weinstein
oh,
yes.
i
would
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
on
itself,
it
would
seem
is
not
coercive
but
the
way
what
the
district
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
what
the
district
judge
did
in
this
case
is
analyze
the
history
and
the
evidence
and
it
was
his
conclusion
which
i
don't
think
can
fairly
be
disagreed
with
that
over
the
span
from
1951
to
1965,
these
rules
worked
to
make
it
possible
for
the
in
group
to
maintain
control,
to
make
it
highly
difficult
for
an
out
group
to
get
a
leg
off.
now
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
is
pernicious
mr.
justice
white
when
the
out
group
is
unable
to
mount
the
campaign
and
put
its
test
to
the
members.
in
our
view
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
there's
never
been
a
fair
test.
mr.
harris
weinstein
there's
never
been
a
fair
test
to
that,
mr.
justice
white
when
the
--
i
think
when
the
record
shows
that
those
who
had
attempted
to
mount
an
opposition
slate
have
been
unable
to
do
so
because
of
this
prior
office
holding
requirement
and
we
would
suggest
that
if
there's
one
thing
that
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
is
that
congress
did
not
want
the
secretary
and
did
not
want
the
courts
inquiring
into
whether
into
question
such
of
this
which
i
would
say
posed
as
whether
a
union
member
ought
to
be
happy
with
what
he
was
getting.
rather
the
congress
as
we
see
it
intended
that
this
question
be
put
to
the
membership
and
open
elections
with
open
opportunity
to
campaign
with
freedom
for
any
dissident
group
to
mount
the
campaign
and
put
its
case
to
the
members
and
let
the
members
decide
whether
they
think
a
new
group
can
do
better
and
its
that
possibility
that
we
think
and
we
think
the
district
court
found
has
been
foreclosed
by
this
rule.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
know
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
for
this
reason,
justice
white.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
a
provision
where
the
best
you
can
do
is
speculate
on
its
effect.
now,
the
average
is
that
the
membership
party
was
defeated
by
a
margin
of
seven
to
one.
the
record
shows
for
example
though
that
there
were
contest
for
two
positions
of
business
agent,
one
of
them
lost
by
seven
to
one,
the
other
one
lost
by
a
little
over
three
to
one.
none
of
the
contest
that
the
membership
party
wanted
to
undertake
for
vice
president
ever
occurred.
the
other
contest,
i
think
six
other
contests
or
five
other
contests
of
business
agent
never
occurred.
now,
in
these
five
districts
where
there
was
no
contest,
we
say
that
the
margin
would
have
been
three
to
one
was
in
one
or
seven
to
one
because
it
was
in
another
district
or
would
it
be
three
to
two
or
perhaps
the
membership
party
might
have
won.
perhaps
they
might
have
won
if
they
had
run
a
vice
presidency.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
and
we
would
go
further
in
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
we
go
further
because
it
is
our
position
when
it
might
have
affected
a
candidate
and
you
do
not
know
who
could
have
come
forward.
that
too
has
an
affect
that
is
imponderable
and
just
simply
cannot
be
measured
by
a
court.
and
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
think
reasonably
probable
is
wrong
as
applied
to
this
record
because
it
requires
--
underlying
any
standard
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
general,
if
were
to
say
reasonably
possible.
yes,
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
slight
variation.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
if
were
seeking
a
general
session
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
brennan.
and
this
--
i
think
in
substance
--
in
our
brief.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
suggest
let's
say
in
the
case
where
the
winning
margin
is
a
thousand
votes
and
the
charge
is
that
a
hundred
ballots
were
destroyed
in
that
counting.
that's
the
case
where
we
should
not
prevail
under
this
test.
now,
it
seems
to
us
the
present
case
isn't
quite
the
other
extreme.
there
will
be
perhaps
harder
ones
that
we
would
agree
would
be
harder
that
fall
in
the
middle
but
it
seems
to
us
when
you
exclude
candidates,
when
we
all
know
that
the
outcome
of
any
election
depends
on
exposure,
on
personality,
on
a
number
of
troops
willing
to
bring
out
--
take
out
the
message
of
the
opposition
forces,
no
court
can
exclude
the
possibility,
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
result
might
have
been
different.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
hold
on
this
record
that
there
is
no
right
to
relief,
simply
rejects
this
change
in
language
that
was
made
in
the
congress
to
insert
these
words
‘may
have.’
it
comes
down
to
showing
an
outright
effect
and
this
is
what
we
think
and
ask
the
court
not
to
do.
thank
you.
