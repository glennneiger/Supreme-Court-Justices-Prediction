mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
bylaw
in
question
was
entirely
reasonable
and
that
the
circuit
court
was
correct
in
its
finding
that
the
bylaw
was
reasonable.
we
further
submit
that
if
this
court
should
find
that
the
bylaw
itself
was
unreasonable,
if
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
finding
and
in
a
cessation,
that
the
outcome
of
the
election
would
in
no
way
have
been
affected.
we
further
submit
for
the
consideration
of
this
court
that
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
in
bottle
blowers
and
in
the
laborer's
case,
in
no
way
determine
the
issue
of
mootness
here.
there
is
one
further
point
which
i
deal
the
time
to
mr.
gold
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
to
discuss
not
as
the
issue
of
the
three
matters
which
were
not
considered
in
the
court.
now,
mr.
weinstein
has
very
carefully
and
very
ably
stated
to
the
court
some
of
the
factual
background
that's
rather
complex
and
before
i
get
to
the
discussion
of
law
on
this,
i'd
like
to
fill
in
some
aspects
of
the
situation
existing
in
this
union
long
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
case
and
long
prior
to
the
legislation
passed.
this
is
a
very
complex
situation.
we
have
problems
that
arise
in
the
fact
when
you
have
a
local
membership
of
26,000
people
working
for
more
than
200
different
employers
spread
throughout
the
city
of
new
york,
embracing
every
type
of
hotel
from
such
large
hotels
as
the
waldorf-astoria
or
the
st.
regis
down
to
a
hotel
having
a
hands.
when
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
certain
crafts
in
great
number
such
as
the
housekeeping
department
or
the
dining
room
department
possibly
overwhelming
the
small
departments
that
have
a
handful
of
people
like
a
telephone
operator
or
an
upholster.
when
you
have
a
series
of
craft
unions
that
have
to
integrate
their
work
with
other
craft
unions
in
protecting
collective
bargaining
benefits,
you'll
have
problems.
now,
this
union
was
founded
almost
30
years
ago,
two
months
ago
and
from
its
inception,
it
was
dedicated
to
the
concept
of
this
being
a
rank
and
file
union
and
runners
again
rank
and
file
union
and
the
essence
of
democracy
was
part
and
parcel
of
its
construction
and
part
and
parcel
of
its
philosophy
all
the
way
through.
it's
a
rather
unique
union.
it's
a
union
which
according
to
the
record
has
achieved
for
its
members
the
highest
standard
of
wages
and
working
conditions
in
the
united
states.
it
is
a
union
which
has
accumulated
more
than
$2.5
million
in
its
direct
funds
and
a
share
in
over
$30
million
in
pension,
welfare
and
medical
funds.
it
is
a
union
where
the
president
of
the
union,
leader
of
more
than
26,000
men
earns
a
salary
of
$225.00
a
week
and
a
maximum
of
expenses
of
$45.00
a
week.
it
is
a
union
which
provides
very
liberal
scholarship
funds
for
the
children
of
its
members.
it
is
a
union
which
concerns
itself
with
the
protection
of
its
members
being
defrauded
by
unscrupulous
consumer
practices.
it
actively
involved
in
legislation
and
above
all
the
games
which
has
achieved
over
the
30-year
period
of
its
existence
have
without
a
single
major
strike
in
the
industry
because
of
the
unique
peace
keeping
machinery
that
it
has
evolved.
now,
all
of
these
facts,
let
it
long
ago
to
feel
that
it
must
take
proper
measures
to
ensure
that
the
union
members
picks
for
itself
the
type
of
office
who
are
qualified
to
guide
and
lead
it.
in
1941,
the
union
adopted
a
rule
that
was
a
prior
experience
rule
and
incidentally,
i
must
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
talking
about
prior
office
holding,
we're
talking
about
prior
union
experience.
in
1941,
which
is
three
years
after
our
union
was
charged,
we
have
been
a
very
large
group
of
shop
delegates
and
we
had
a
shop
delegates
council
and
the
shop
delegates
council
basically
consisted
of
the
people
who
are
most
enthusiastic
about
union
affairs
and
the
proper
conduct
of
the
union.
they
were
the
backbone
of
--
around
which
the
union
organized
its
organizational
job.
and
we
then
made
it
a
condition
precedent
to
holding
membership
or
holding
officership
in
the
union
that
one
should
have
demonstrated
some
interest
in
activity
in
the
union
by
participating
in
the
work
of
the
shop
delegates
council.
in
1951,
we
found
that
the
shop
delegates
council
method
of
procedure
was
unworthy
and
we
amended
our
bylaws
in
1951
so
that
we
have
an
assembly
which
could
conduct
that
day-to-day
business
of
the
union
in
place
of
a
membership
meeting.
you
must
remember
that
there
is
no
hall
large
enough,
anywhere
in
new
york
city
where
you
can
have
26,000
people
come
to
the
union
meeting.
and
if
you
could
have
a
hall
large
enough
to
accommodate
26,000
people,
you
couldn't
conduct
union
business
in
that
kind
of
an
atmosphere
so
that
we
in
1951
established
the
assembly
as
the
working
body
to
whom
the
offers
were
accountable
and
to
whom
we
could
look
to
union
leadership.
now,
this
union
has
peculiar
history.
from
1938
the
time
when
it
was
first
chartered
down
to
the
present
time,
elections
have
been
held
by
secret
ballot
with
voting
machines
under
impartial
supervision
and
honest
valid
association
with
opportunity
for
all
members
to
vote
providing
they
were
in
good
standing.
and
from
1938
down
to
the
present
time,
the
union
administration
has
been
reelected
over
and
over
and
over
again
by
votes
ranging
from
seven
to
one
to
ten
to
one
to
sometimes
where
there
has
been
no
opposition.
our
query
is
that
overwhelming
vote
of
confidence
come
as
a
result
of
a
press
of
tactics,
as
a
result
of
scheme
and
a
device
whereby
one
avoids
the
picture
--
the
clear
intent
of
the
congressional
legislation
or
does
that
overwhelming
vote
come
because
the
membership
is
cognizant
to
the
fact
that
it
has
achieved
such
tremendous
gains
under
the
leadership.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
and
may
i
quote
mr.
justice
brennan
on
that
point.
mr.
justice
brennan
said
in
153,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
weighed
how
best
to
legislate
against
revealed
abuses
in
union
elections
without
departing
needlessly
from
its
long
standing
policy
against
unnecessary
governmental
intrusion
into
internal
union
affairs.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
nobody
could
have
a
stated
that
more
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
i
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i
wish
that
i've
written
it.
i
think
it's
stated
as
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
now
the
thought
that
i
have
is
that
the
congress
enacted
two-pronged
legislation
here.
congress
balanced
it.
congress
was
determined
as
it
should
have
been
determined
to
correct
union
abuses
and
it
stated
what
those
union
abuses
were
and
it
categorized
them
and
then
on
the
other
hand,
it
said
we
don't
want
to
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
trade
union.
we
leave
it
to
reasonable
man
to
decide
what
is
reasonable
and
it's
when
something
is
clearly
unrelated
to
a
lawful
union
objective
that
the
courts
and
the
secretary
should
interfere.
i'm
sorry
sir.
may
i
ask
to
your
question
now?
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
they
all
work
in
dining
room.
that's
the
waiters
union.
you
see,
they
don't
have
the
same
kind
of
problems
we
have
and
that's
waiters
--
there's
enough
hotel
waiters
so
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
the
waiters
union.
it's
called
the
waiters
union.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that's
the
luncheonette
union.
we
deal
--
deal
only
with
the
hotel
workers
and
of
the
club
workers.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i
don't
know
but
let
me
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
does
or
it
does
not.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
but
let
me
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
judge
--
it
does
not
follow
it
and
my
associate
here
tells
me
that
but
let
me
discuss
this
whole
question
of
comparison
since
you've
raised
the
point.
the
government
has
asked
the
court
to
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
other
unions
don't
have
that
kind
of
requirement
but
that
is
a
prior
experience
requirement.
the
record
shows
that
there
are
40,000
local
unions
in
the
united
states
that
report
to
the
department
of
labor.
out
of
that
40,000,
200
constitutions
were
analyzed
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
which
leave
some
39,800
bylaw,
sets
of
bylaws
not
examined.
further
than
that,
reference
is
made
to
76
international
constitutions
of
which
only
one
iotw
contains
a
prior
office
holding
requirement.
our
international
union,
the
hotel
international
is
listed
as
one
of
those
organizations
or
internationals
which
doesn't
have
a
prior
office
holding
requirement.
yet,
the
record
shows
here
that
25%
or
more
of
the
local
unions
in
our
international
union
which
does
not
have
a
prior
office
holding
or
a
prior
experience
requirement
do
have
a
rule
somewhat
similar
to
ours.
in
other
words,
sensible
and
i
say
somewhat
similar
prior
experience
requirement.
in
other
words,
an
analysis
of
the
record
shows
how
unreliable
a
guide,
an
analysis
of
200
local
bylaws
may
be
or
the
international
bylaws
maybe.
in
other
words,
we
can't
rely
on
statistics
alone.
we
have
to
take
into
consideration,
what
is
the
situation
which
confronts
the
union
that's
in
the
court
today.
why
did
they
do
what
they
did?
was
it
because
there
was
a
sinister
purpose
by
a
group
of
people
to
perpetuate
themselves
in
office?
did
they
have
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
congress
is
going
to
pass
legislation
in
1959
and
how
could
they
circumvent
legislation
or
was
it
related
to
a
genuine
desire
of
the
rank
and
file
members
of
the
union
to
see
that
a
union
is
large
and
is
complex
as
this
and
as
many
problems
they
had,
govern
themselves
properly.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
with
the
further
exception
which
you
quoted
before
justice
fortas.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
justice
fortas,
let
me
meet
that
burden
which
you've
stated
and
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
meet
it
on
the
assumption
that
presides
imposes
a
heavy
burden
on
us.
yes,
i
think
it
does
impose
a
heavy
burden
but
we've
met
it.
we
have
here
a
requirement
which
resulted
in
a
pool
of
1700
candidates
who
could
very
easily
be
nominated
for
office.
there
are
1700
old
timers.
1700
people
who
take
active
part
in
the
union.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
5%.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
i'm
going
to
go
to
that
in
just
a
moment
but
there
are
1700
people
who
could
run
with
four
principle
offices
and
21
associated
offices.
just
remember,
we're
talking
about
31
candidates
per
office
in
an
entire
union
and
if
an
opposition
slate
can't
find
31
people
to
nominate
out
of
1700,
either
the
union
is
doing
something
right
or
the
opposition
is
doing
something
wrong
but
let
me
go
a
step
further.
if
the
congress
had
wanted
to
set
down
a
set
of
rules
in
a
clear
and
unequivocal
language
that
said
that
every
member
of
the
union
shall
be
eligible
to
run
for
office.
it
would
have
said
so.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
alright,
then
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
i'm
not
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i'm
sorry,
sir.
let
me
apply
to
our
own
union.
first,
we
are
proud
to
be
what
is
known
as
an
open
union.
in
other
words,
anybody
can
become
a
member
of
our
union
after
30
days
in
the
industry.
we
don't
have
a
close
union.
secondly,
we
have
a
union
that
has
peculiar
membership.
we
have
a
great,
many
unskilled
workers
who
were
there
for
a
very
short
period
because
they're
constantly
trying
to
use
this
as
a
stepping
stone.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
we
take
in
all
the
dining
room
employees,
all
the
kitchen
employees,
the
housekeeping
employees,
the
laundry
employees,
the
club
employees
in
every
club
in
new
york
city
such
as
--
even
including
telephone
operators,
upholsterers.
in
general,
every
employee
in
a
hotel
that
comes
within
the
dining
crafts,
the
service
crafts
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
dishwashers,
yes.
we
take
in
the
dishwashers,
we
take
in
the
chefs,
we
take
in
the
kitchen
workers
in
general,
the
miscellaneous
employees.
it's
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
yes,
many
of
them
are
uneducated.
we
have
a
large
precaution
of
negro
and
puerto
rican
membership.
in
this
union,
many
of
them
have
always
been
in
the
leadership
of
the
union
and
incidentally
justice
black,
if
you
lead
me
to
a
point
that
i
should
like
to
discuss,
there
is
a
provision
on
the
chart
which
mr.
weinstein
has
showed
which
provides
that
it's
possible
for
an
appointment
of
a
vice
president
and
the
question
rises
why
should
there
be
a
possible
appointment
of
a
right
vice
president.
i
think
you
raised
the
question
mr.
justice
white.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
we
try
to
make
sure
that
from
the
beginning
of
our
organization
down
to
the
present
time
since
we
have
a
large
number
of
women
who
are
members
of
the
union,
generally
in
the
housekeeping
department
that
there
would
always
be
at
least
one
woman
in
the
leadership
of
the
office
--
of
the
union.
secondly,
we
have
a
large
number
of
negro
workers
and
we
try
to
make
sure
that
we
would
always
have
at
least
one
negro
among
the
leadership.
fortunately,
in
the
30
years
that
we've
conducted
elections,
it's
never
been
necessary
for
the
assembly
to
exercise
its
right
to
appoint
a
vice
president
to
represent,
shall
we
say,
either
a
minority
group
or
a
woman.
they've
always
been
elected
in
general.
that's
the
reason
for
the
reserve
provision
in
the
constitution
to
make
sure
that
every
element
in
the
union
could
be
represented.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
we
have
no
educational
requirement
but
we
have
sir,
fortunately,
a
great
many
people
who
are
passing
through
the
union
and
that
they
are
working
their
way
through
college,
a
law
school,
a
medical
school
that
may
get
their
jobs
in
the
banquet
department
or
as
a
waiter.
we
have
a
number
of
actresses
who
are
quite
--
who
--
when
they're
unemployed,
get
jobs,
working
on
the
clubs
or
the
hotels.
so
that
we
have
a
fairly
literate
group
combined
with
the
group
of
less
educational
background.
it's
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
people.
we
are
little
cosmos
of
our
own.
i
think
if
you
read
the
record,
you
will
find
that
the
union
spokesman,
dedicated
and
articulate
and
that
their
whole
set
of
bylaws
had
been
designed
so
as
to
get
as
close
to
an
ideal
system
enforcing
a
representation
as
you
can
find.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
no.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
although
it
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
no
justice
black.
those
people
are
all
professionally
hired.
we
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no.
the
secretary
is
elected
from
the
membership.
this
is
traditional.
the
secretary
has
always
been
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
oh,
as
the
secretary-treasurer
whose
duties
are
to
handle
the
funds
of
the
union.
the
funds
amount
to
several
million
dollars
but
he
gets
this
guidance
on
that
from
certified
public
accountants,
from
an
ibm
machine.
we
had
ibm
machines
installed
20
years
ago.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no
experience
in
the
union,
no
special
qualification.
experience
in
union
matters.
there
are
no
special
qualifications
for
that.
just
his
special
dedication
to
union
matters.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
claim
anywhere
that
secretaries
or
treasurers
need
have
any
special
educational
requirements.
we're
fortunate
that
we
have
very
good
ones
but
there
is
no
real
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
it's
true
in
as
such,
the
membership
to
reject
them
or
accept
them.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
they
get
acquainted
with
one
another
because
they
live
in
the
same
community.
we
published
the
newspaper
for
the
last
30
years.
we
have
very
frequent
committee
meetings
and
membership
meetings
and
we
try
--
all
our
officers
try
and
take
advantage
of
the
union
fold
to
use
a
forum
and
that's
where
we
introduce
our
various
programs
of
participation
in
community
activity.
somehow
rather
in
the
world
in
which
we
live,
you
get
to
know
the
qualifications
of
the
people.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
the
hotel
world.
it's
the
26,000
people
who
work
in
hotels.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
all
over
new
york
city,
justice
black.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
it's
--
it's
difficult.
it's
the
same
problem
as
posed
universally.
we
do
have
very
frequent
committee
meetings
at
union
headquarters.
the
business
agents
and
the
general
officers
visit
the
hotels
frequently.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
they
are
the
officers,
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
let's
take
what
happened
in
this
particular
case,
they
publish
leaflets,
they
have
headquarters,
they
solicit
membership
throughout
the
hotels.
they
exploit
grievances
if
there
are
grievances
to
be
exploited.
i
think
it's
a
normal
course
of
--
you
just
have
to
make
your
own
value
of
judgment
about
the
qualifications
of
the
people
whom
you're
interested
in.
no
more
than
i
--
than
i
could
become
acquainted
with
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
candidates
for
president
of
the
united
states,
of
the
u.s.
senate.
i
just
have
to
read
about
them,
use
my
own
judgment
and
i
do
because
i'm
interested
in
the
general
situation.
union
members
are
interested
in
the
union
situation
somehow
or
rather
they
get
to
know
the
people
who
have
leadership.
it's
a
natural
process.
excuse
me
sir.
and
this
incidentally
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
should
be
some
qualification
so
that
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
should
have
some
qualifications.
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
the
point
of
your
question
sir.
let
me
go
on
to
what
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
let
me
tell
you
why
we
have
dispensed
it.
first,
it
was
an
experience
of
qualification
but
we
dispense
of
it
because
when
the
secretary
call
to
our
attention,
this
issue
was
challenged.
we
conducted
a
very
exhaustive
examination
of
our
records
to
the
first
time
since
1951
to
see
what
the
factual
situation
was.
and
we
found
that
there
was
a
pool
of
1700
people.
we
paid
for
the
experts
that
came
in,
we
analyze
the
records,
we
cooperated
with
the
secretary
and
we
did
everything
that
we
could
because
we
wanted
to
know
what's
right
and
what's
wrong
and
we
said
that
1700
for
31
offices
are
certainly
reasonable
but
then
the
question
came
up,
what's
going
to
happen
five
years
from
now?
what's
going
to
happen
10
years
from
now?
a
lot
of
people
will
pass
out
of
the
union
scene
because
of
death,
illness,
retirement,
attrition
generally
and
we
might
be
left
with
a
situation
that
would
be
completely
unreasonable
and
the
question
came
and
i'm
very
frank
to
state
to
the
court.
some
people
said
that
if
we
amend
our
bylaws
now,
it
might
be
a
confession
of
weakness.
on
the
other
hand,
our
union
leadership
said
nonsense.
we
run
this
union
for
the
benefit
of
the
members.
if
we
have
a
situation
that
should
be
correct
for
the
future,
let's
correct
it.
so
in
december
of
1966,
we
did
what
we've
done
many,
many
times
in
the
past,
and
that
is
amend
our
bylaws
so
that
it
would
be
not
only
in
consonance
with
the
spirit
of
legislation
and
the
spirit
of
good
trade
unionism
but
with
the
letter
as
well.
and
so
we
amended
our
bylaws
in
december
of
1966
of
the
next
election
which
is
going
to
take
place
two
weeks
from
now
will
be
conducted
under
a
situation
where
there
will
be
a
pool
of
17,000
people
eligible
to
be
nominated
for
office.
that
is
in
addition
to
the
old
requirement
which
we
still
have
which
makes
prior
office
--
prior
experience
desired.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
there's
going
to
be
an
opposition
slate,
they
have
nominated
for
our
position.
i
have
the
newspaper
here.
they've
operated
four
candidates
for
general
office
and
they've
nominated
i
think
eight
other
candidates
out
of
the
31
and
the
opposition
slate
will
probably
conduct
the
same
kind
of
campaign
that
they
conduct
the
last
time.
let
me
advert
to
the
10,000
--
sorry
sir.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
those
who
have
not
been
members
of
the
union
for
five
years.
in
other
words,
those
are
the
only
once
who
constitute
the
ineligibles.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
under
the
new
bylaws.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no.
under
the
old
one
--
under
the
one
which
the
1965
election
was
held,
there
were
1700
people
and
only
1700
people
who
satisfied
the
prior
experience
requirement.
under
the
new
bylaws
in
addition
to
those
people,
there
are
now
a
total
17,000
who
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no.
that
is
one
year
requirement
for
running
for
office.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
one
year.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
sorry.
two
years.
i'm
sorry
justice
fortas,
mr.
lurie
corrected
me.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
no,
no.
no.
we
have
raise
to
--
for
holding
general
office
for
five
years.
but
the
membership
and
the
assembly,
anybody
who
has
been
in
the
union
for
one
year
is
eligible
to
run
for
the
assembly.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that's
right.
not
being
an
officer
in
the
assembly.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
for
the
top
officer
--
no.
let
me
see
if
i
can
straighten
that
up.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
it
was
a
continuous
good
standing
for
two
years
under
the
old
bylaw.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
two
years
of
continuous
good
standing
but
five
years
membership
in
the
union.
in
other
words,
one
may
be
a
member
of
the
union
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
if
the
two
years
of
good
standing
were
immediately
proceed
until
the
time
when
you're
running
for
office.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
i
think
impressive
is
almost
as
difficult
to
define
as
reasonable.
may
i
just
add
to
one
question
and
this
is
about
the
10,000
people
who
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
a
man
may
be
a
member
of
a
union
and
not
pay
his
dues.
that's
the
only
thing
that
makes
some
bad
standing.
anybody
is
in
good
standing
if
he
pays
his
dues
properly.
especially
on
the
qualification.
there
are
no
reprisals
here.
there
are
no
claims
of
reprisals
of
kicking
people
out
and
anything
of
that
sort.
it
just
doesn't
exist.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes,
that's
all.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
and
people
generally
pay
their
dues
because
there
are
substantial
pension
and
medical
plans
so
that
we
don't
have
very
much
of
a
problem
on
that.
it's
just
theoritical
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that's
true.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
now,
that's
true.
i
think
you
brought
it
accurately.
and
i
--
i
may
not
have
answered
it
clearly
but
you've
read
it
accurately
sir.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
of
course
not.
may
i
adjust
myself
of
the
10
--
of
the
nature
of
the
10,000
people.
we
do
have
a
large
turnover
because
people
come
into
the
industry
in
the
unskilled
job.
that's
one
of
the
group
that
comes
in
and
it
would
be
wrong
in
our
view
to
just
make
it
possible
for
people
who
drift
in
and
out
of
the
industry
in
these
unskilled
jobs
to
be
entrusted
with
the
leadership
of
so
complex
a
structure
as
ours.
secondly,
we
have
in
the
union
a
number
of
people
who
come
in
as
i've
indicated
on
a
very
temporary
basis
and
that
is
the
young
law
student
or
the
young
medical
student
who
is
trying
to
earn
a
living
while
he's
at
school
and
he
is
going
to
drift
out
of
the
union
and
while
we
welcome
their
participation
in
union
affairs
when
they're
in
the
union,
they're
going
to
go
out.
thirdly,
we
have
a
number
of
classes
that
come
in
where
people
want
training
in
the
union.
they
eventually
expect
to
be
hotel
managers
or
restaurant
operators,
it's
a
great
training
ground
so
that
they
drift
in
or
out
for
two
or
three
years
in
order
to
get
experience.
we
feel
that
it's
reasonable
in
our
situation
under
our
new
bylaws
to
require
a
minimum
of
five
years
and
that's
why
there
may
be
a
group
of
people
within
that
membership
period
of
drifting
in
and
out
almost
10,000
people
who
are
not
eligible
in
our
opinion
to
qualify
for
office
but
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
sorry
sir.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
because
it
gives
the
feel
of
the
union.
first,
it
will
take
you
through
a
couple
of
collective
bargaining
processes.
it
will
give
one
a
chance
to
show
to
his
fellow
members
that
he
is
interested
in
the
work
of
the
union.
we
have
dozens
and
dozens
of
committees
in
which
people
served.
we
have
educational
programs
in
which
people
participate
and
we
feel
that
somebody
before
he
submits
himself
to
the
membership
office,
at
least
has
to
get
the
smell
of
the
union.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
any.
we're
talking
of
the
31
general
offices.
i
mean,
we're
talking
of
the
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that
is
for
the
president,
the
general
organizers,
the
secretary-treasurer
and
the
recording
treasurer.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that's
all
that's
included
among
the
31
offices.
now
remember,
membership
in
the
assembly
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no.
plus
the
business
agents,
plus
the
business
agents
and
the
seven
vice
presidents.
there
are
only
31
offices
have
to
recruit.
now,
anybody
who
have
to
have
these
requirements
--
now
anybody
is
eligible
to
run
for
the
assembly
if
he
has
been
in
the
union
for
one
year.
now,
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
here
about
the
fact
that
they
can't
be
elected
unless
they
are
part
of
the
administration
caucus
or
the
administration
slate.
let
me
refer
to
that
for
a
moment.
we
have
a
very
successful
record.
the
opposition
hasn't
been
elected
but
that's
not
a
sin.
the
opposition
hasn't
been
elected
because
as
judge
wyatt
found,
they
have
no
program
to
offer
to
the
membership
while
the
administration
has
a
very
successful
problem
to
offer
to
the
membership.
about
coming
to
the
caucus,
if
i
call
mr.
weinstein's
argument
logically,
he
would
expect
mr.
kennedy
would
invite
mr.
humphrey
to
send
delegates
to
mr.
kennedy's
caucus
to
plan
out
--
to
plan
how
mr.
kennedy
was
going
to
be
elected
for
office
or
mr.
goldwater
would
want
to
come
to
mr.
johnson's
caucus
so
that
he
could
be
represented
at
mr.
johnson's
caucus.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
now,
the
secretary
has
been
very
fair
in
his
presentations
to
the
court
through
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
really
know
what
he
wants,
that
he
hasn't
had
enough
experience
with
this
whole
question
of
prior
experience
and
prior
office
holding.
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
when
ambassador
goldberg
was
the
secretary,
he
had
enough
expertise
and
he
had
enough
knowledge
to
issue
a
couple
of
interpretative
bulletins
which
were
just
made
available
to
us
as
a
result
to
the
public
disclosure
act
only
recently.
let
me
tell
you
the
two
criteria
that
ambassador
goldberg
relied
on
in
1960
when
he
published
two
interpretive
ruling.
these
are
found
in
the
lmrda
interpretive
manual,
section
422.250
and
section
422.270.
they're
cited
in
our
supplemental
brief.
this
is
what
justice
goldberg
--
excuse
me,
ambassador
goldberg
said
on
august
25,
1960,
“participation
in
union
affairs,
qualifications
reasonably
designed
to
assure
that
candidates
had
participated
in
the
affairs
in
the
union
and
are
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
industry
in
which
the
union
operates
would
not
be
considered
unreasonable
and
ordinary
circumstances
if
uniformly
opposed.
in
the
absence
of
knowledge
of
any
special
circumstances
which
cast
out
upon
the
validity
and
reasonableness
of
any
of
the
qualifications,
they
are
not
to
be
considered
unreasonable
in
themselves.”
now,
take
our
situation
here
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that's
dated
august
25,
1960.
it's
recorded
in
the
lmrda
interpretive
manual
of
u.s.
department
of
labor.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
august
25,
1960.
does
he
mention?
i'm
sorry.
i
apologize.
i'll
take
secretary
mitchell
who
was
--
who
had
great
expertise
in
this
field
and
was
appointed
secretary
of
labor.
with
that,
i
see
i've
loss
track
of
my
history.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
thank
you
sir.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
in
a
very
short
time
that
i
have
left
in
me
to
get
to
the
considerations
of
the
question
whether
or
not,
the
outcome
of
the
election
would
have
been
affected
if
the
rule
were
improper.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
of
justice
wyatt
or
judge
wyatt
on
that
point
which
is
sighted
at
page
48
of
our
brief.
he
said,
“consideration
has
been
given
not
merely
to
the
effect
of
the
bylaw
on
those
disqualified
but
to
its
possible
effect
in
discouraging
others
from
coming
forward
as
opposing
candidates.
nonetheless,
the
heavy
vote
in
favor
of
the
administration
candidates
is
convincing
that
the
existence
and
enforcement
of
the
bylaw
could
not
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
the
evidence
satisfies
me
that
the
primary
reason
for
the
heavy
vote
in
favor
of
the
administration
was
a
lack
of
any
real
grievance
or
issue
against
the
union
management.
the
platform
of
the
opposition
membership
party
did
not
charge
any
abuses
or
misconduct
or
even
any
inefficiency.
there
was
no
attempt
to
state
any
specific
complaints.
there
was
no
dramatic
or
important
issue
to
route
the
membership
against
the
incumbents.
the
appeal
that
the
opposition
was
in
substance
that
it
could
do
the
job
better.
now,
that
also
was
concurred
in
by
judge
dimock
sitting
as
a
member
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
why
it
was
it
necessary?
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
the
bylaw
had
been
established
15
years
--
eight
years
before
the
legislation
in
question
and
had
been
historically
in
the
bylaw
for
--
since
the
union
was
charged
that
the
prior
experience
was
--
but
judge
black,
please
forgive
me.
i
just
have
a
few
moments
to
discuss
the
preponderance
--
the
statute
itself
but
i
don't
want
to
address
myself
at
this
point
to
the
reasonableness.
your
honor
may
feel
that
it's
against
us.
i
feel
that
it
so
strongly
supports
the
reason
why
the
election
would
not
have
been
affected
if
the
bylaw
had
been
in
there
or
not
been
in
there
and
that
is
an
important
part
of
the
statute
as
any
other
part
of
the
statute.
the
statute
reads
that
it's
the
secretary's
burden
to
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
different
if
the
bylaw
hadn't
been
there.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
may
have
been,
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
may
have
affected,
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
there
is
a
--
well,
there
is
a
difference
but
there
has
to
be
a
probability
that
might
have
been
affected.
remember
the
fact
to
a
situation
here
mr.
justice
brennan.
you
have
the
four
candidates
including
the
two
who
had
been
disqualified
for
running
for
general
office
actually
submit
themselves
to
the
vote
of
the
membership
because
they
were
candidates
for
delegates
to
the
international
convention.
they
were
defeated
by
votes
of
seven
to
one,
so
that
we
did
have
an
election,
the
membership
did
express
itself.
their
statute
calls
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
now,
they
must
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
it
may
have
been
--
that
the
outcome
may
have
been
affected.
now,
what
is
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
they
produce
no
evidence
of
any
kind.
certainly,
the
words
“preponderance
of
the
evidence
must
be
given
some
statutory
meeting.”
now,
when
that's
taken
into
consideration
with
the
fact
that
the
legislation
that
this
court
has
set
forth
so
many
times
in
the
various
opinions
was
not
designed
to
make
the
trade
union
unharmed
of
the
government
but
it
was
designed
to
keep
the
union's
free
and
independent
and
that
the
regulations
were
only
those
which
dealt
with
abuses.
i
think
that
you
cannot
read
out
of
the
statute
the
clear
words
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
the
burden
of
the
secretary
can
prove
that
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
secretary
is
asking
this
court
my
opinion
to
give
a
construction
to
the
statute
which
would
completely
nullify
the
words
which
the
congress
was
so
careful
to
put
into
it.
now,
i
can't
concede
of
any
situation
if
we
are
to
follow
the
secretary's
argument
whereby
automatically
if
a
bylaw
is
found
unreasonable,
it
doesn't
then
become
necessary
to
declare
the
election
void
and
to
order
a
supervised
election.
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
the
congress
wanted
to
prevent
abuses.
it
did
prevent
abuses.
congress
wanted
to
keep
the
unions
free
to
regulate
their
own
internal
affairs.
i
think
it
did
and
when
we
consider
the
factors,
one
of
the
justices
today
indicated
that
it
can't
be
the
intention
of
the
secretary
to
go
into
40,000
separate
sets
of
bylaws
or
to
compel
a
union
as
i
would
interpret
that
to
risk
an
election
which
cost
$25,000
or
$30,000
in
that
case
and
then
worry
as
to
whether
years
later
the
secretary
may
adopt
the
standard
which
is
going
to
outlaw
the
election.
i
don't
think
that
we
could
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i
think
that
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
which
would
have
to
be
followed.
and
may
i
address
myself
in
just
two
or
three
minutes
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
and
what
are
these
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no.
because
if
--
the
two
decisions
that
you
read
--
that
you
quote
are
the
decision
in
153
and
125,
and
those
two
situations
--
in
those
two
cases,
the
situation
is
completely
different
because
in
153,
the
supervening
election
was
under
the
old
bylaw
so
that
the
court
wouldn't
tolerate
a
situation
whereby
trick
and
device,
you
could
frustrate
the
clear
intent
of
the
legislation.
in
the
125,
the
election
was
conducted
under
--
it
was
the
conduct
of
the
election
that
was
improper.
the
charge
was
there
that
the
incumbent
officers
had
at
the
voting
list
so
that
their
favorites
could
vote
and
those
who
were
not
their
favorites
might
be
excluded.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
a
situation
here.
we
have
an
election
which
has
taken
place
under
a
bylaw
which
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
found
to
be
reasonable
and
where
we,
ourselves,
a
year-and-a-half
prior
to
the
election,
to
the
forthcoming
election
have
amended
the
bylaw
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
as
long
as
it
was
warranted.
but
the
question
is
whether
it
would
be
warranted
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you
is
a
complete
--
i
think
the
only
honest
answer
i
can
give
you
is
that
the
situation
is
different
under
which
the
two
elections
have
taken
place
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i
don't
think
it
is
foreclosed.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
glass
blowers
and
153
in
this
case.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes,
and
these
cases
have
to
be
decided
on
the
facts
because
the
secretary
asserted
this
argument,
we
don't
know
what
the
general
rule
is
we
haven't
laid
down
a
general
rule.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
right.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
not
if
the
court
so
orders
it.
may
i
tell
you
this
--
may
i
suggest
this
to
you.
the
congressional
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
because
the
question
is
whether
it's
necessary,
we'd
have
to
go
back
to
the
court,
i
assume
to
the
district
court
to
direct
in
terms
under
which
the
supervised
elections
could
be
held.
remember
here
that
we
are
not
talking
about
misconduct
in
the
election
or
any
of
the
specific
abuses.
we're
only
talking
about
the
application
of
the
rule.
the
supervised
--
permit
me
justice
fortas
if
i
may.
the
supervised
election
requires
that
it
would
be
held
under
the
rules
of
the
union
as
far
as
it's
practical
and
in
conformance
with
the
bylaws.
now,
where
we
have
amended
our
bylaws
and
where
i
don't
think
that
today,
there
has
been
any
serious
challenge,
the
way
you
have
17,000
people
eligible
to
hold,
to
run
for
office
of
31
people
clearly
under
what
bylaws
will
they
be
held?
we
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
really
nothing
for
the
secretary
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
i
would
suggest
that
we
would
--
should
be
entitled
to
our
day
in
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
new
bylaw
is
appropriate.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
then
may
i
say
that
i
think
the
statutory
scheme
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes,
but
i
also
think
that
the
secretary's
day
in
court
has
to
come
after
he
has
exhausted
the
procedure
which
the
statute
provides.
it's
a
very
difficult
situation.
i
doubt
i
haven't
answered
it
promptly.
we
all
have
problems
with
it.
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
i
think
that
just
playing
common
sense
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
of
where
the
old
election
which
we
are
talking
about
is
going
to
terminate
in
two
weeks
and
where
the
--
that
is
the
term
of
office
terminates
in
two
weeks
and
where
we
have
a
new
situation
where
the
new
election
is
not
taking
place
under
the
same
challenged
bylaw
but
under
a
different
set
of
bylaws
that
it
wasn't
the
intention
of
congress
to
make
chaos
out
of
order
but
it's
rather
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
then
i
failed.
i
think
that
we
are
making
a
strong
argument
for
the
mootness
in
this
particular
situation
where
we
have
a
situation
where
the
old
election
would
not
have
been
set
aside
because
it
hasn't
been
shown
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
a
different
bylaw
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
where
we
have
a
situation
where
the
new
election
will
provide
the
members
with
about
17,000
people
whom
they
may
choose
for
their
31
offices.
and
again,
i
come
back
to
the
fact
that
we
rely
on
our
basic
position
that
even
the
old
bylaw
had
a
legitimate
purpose
and
was
not
a
conspiratorial
purpose.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i
think
that
the
court
has
definitely
prohibited
that
situation.
i
think
it
will
be
very
bad
if
it
happen.
and
i
think
that
the
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
that
couldn't
happen
under
bottle
blowers
and
nobody
would
want
to
have
it
happen.
i
just
say
that
that,
in
our
opinion,
doesn't
preclude
the
situation
of
a
union
doing
what
it
should
do
and
that
is
meet
the
dynamic
demands
of
its
membership
and
change
as
the
occasion
warrants
it.
that's
what
a
good
union
should
do.
our
amending
process
is
very
easy.
i
think
that
we
anticipated,
properly
anticipated
everything
that
a
descent
trade
union
ought
to
do
to
preserve
the
rights
of
its
membership.
it
wasn't
done
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
frankly
sir,
i
couldn't
see
it.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
mr.
gold
is
going
to
argue
those
and
therefore
i
haven't
done
it
except
that
i
think
they're
really
minimal
when
you
get
into
it
and
look
at
the
record
as
to
what
they
wanted
to
prove.
but
mr.
gold
is
going
to
argue
that.
i
don't
want
to
trespass
on
his
time
on
that.
i
think
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you
very,
very
much.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
bylaw
in
question
was
entirely
reasonable
and
that
the
circuit
court
was
correct
in
its
finding
that
the
bylaw
was
reasonable.
we
further
submit
that
if
this
court
should
find
that
the
bylaw
itself
was
unreasonable,
if
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
finding
and
in
a
cessation,
that
the
outcome
of
the
election
would
in
no
way
have
been
affected.
we
further
submit
for
the
consideration
of
this
court
that
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
in
bottle
blowers
and
in
the
laborer's
case,
in
no
way
determine
the
issue
of
mootness
here.
there
is
one
further
point
which
i
deal
the
time
to
mr.
gold
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
to
discuss
not
as
the
issue
of
the
three
matters
which
were
not
considered
in
the
court.
now,
mr.
weinstein
has
very
carefully
and
very
ably
stated
to
the
court
some
of
the
factual
background
that's
rather
complex
and
before
i
get
to
the
discussion
of
law
on
this,
i'd
like
to
fill
in
some
aspects
of
the
situation
existing
in
this
union
long
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
case
and
long
prior
to
the
legislation
passed.
this
is
a
very
complex
situation.
we
have
problems
that
arise
in
the
fact
when
you
have
a
local
membership
of
26,000
people
working
for
more
than
200
different
employers
spread
throughout
the
city
of
new
york,
embracing
every
type
of
hotel
from
such
large
hotels
as
the
waldorf-astoria
or
the
st.
regis
down
to
a
hotel
having
a
hands.
when
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
certain
crafts
in
great
number
such
as
the
housekeeping
department
or
the
dining
room
department
possibly
overwhelming
the
small
departments
that
have
a
handful
of
people
like
a
telephone
operator
or
an
upholster.
when
you
have
a
series
of
craft
unions
that
have
to
integrate
their
work
with
other
craft
unions
in
protecting
collective
bargaining
benefits,
you'll
have
problems.
now,
this
union
was
founded
almost
30
years
ago,
two
months
ago
and
from
its
inception,
it
was
dedicated
to
the
concept
of
this
being
a
rank
and
file
union
and
runners
again
rank
and
file
union
and
the
essence
of
democracy
was
part
and
parcel
of
its
construction
and
part
and
parcel
of
its
philosophy
all
the
way
through.
it's
a
rather
unique
union.
it's
a
union
which
according
to
the
record
has
achieved
for
its
members
the
highest
standard
of
wages
and
working
conditions
in
the
united
states.
it
is
a
union
which
has
accumulated
more
than
$2.5
million
in
its
direct
funds
and
a
share
in
over
$30
million
in
pension,
welfare
and
medical
funds.
it
is
a
union
where
the
president
of
the
union,
leader
of
more
than
26,000
men
earns
a
salary
of
$225.00
a
week
and
a
maximum
of
expenses
of
$45.00
a
week.
it
is
a
union
which
provides
very
liberal
scholarship
funds
for
the
children
of
its
members.
it
is
a
union
which
concerns
itself
with
the
protection
of
its
members
being
defrauded
by
unscrupulous
consumer
practices.
it
actively
involved
in
legislation
and
above
all
the
games
which
has
achieved
over
the
30-year
period
of
its
existence
have
without
a
single
major
strike
in
the
industry
because
of
the
unique
peace
keeping
machinery
that
it
has
evolved.
now,
all
of
these
facts,
let
it
long
ago
to
feel
that
it
must
take
proper
measures
to
ensure
that
the
union
members
picks
for
itself
the
type
of
office
who
are
qualified
to
guide
and
lead
it.
in
1941,
the
union
adopted
a
rule
that
was
a
prior
experience
rule
and
incidentally,
i
must
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
talking
about
prior
office
holding,
we're
talking
about
prior
union
experience.
in
1941,
which
is
three
years
after
our
union
was
charged,
we
have
been
a
very
large
group
of
shop
delegates
and
we
had
a
shop
delegates
council
and
the
shop
delegates
council
basically
consisted
of
the
people
who
are
most
enthusiastic
about
union
affairs
and
the
proper
conduct
of
the
union.
they
were
the
backbone
of
--
around
which
the
union
organized
its
organizational
job.
and
we
then
made
it
a
condition
precedent
to
holding
membership
or
holding
officership
in
the
union
that
one
should
have
demonstrated
some
interest
in
activity
in
the
union
by
participating
in
the
work
of
the
shop
delegates
council.
in
1951,
we
found
that
the
shop
delegates
council
method
of
procedure
was
unworthy
and
we
amended
our
bylaws
in
1951
so
that
we
have
an
assembly
which
could
conduct
that
day-to-day
business
of
the
union
in
place
of
a
membership
meeting.
you
must
remember
that
there
is
no
hall
large
enough,
anywhere
in
new
york
city
where
you
can
have
26,000
people
come
to
the
union
meeting.
and
if
you
could
have
a
hall
large
enough
to
accommodate
26,000
people,
you
couldn't
conduct
union
business
in
that
kind
of
an
atmosphere
so
that
we
in
1951
established
the
assembly
as
the
working
body
to
whom
the
offers
were
accountable
and
to
whom
we
could
look
to
union
leadership.
now,
this
union
has
peculiar
history.
from
1938
the
time
when
it
was
first
chartered
down
to
the
present
time,
elections
have
been
held
by
secret
ballot
with
voting
machines
under
impartial
supervision
and
honest
valid
association
with
opportunity
for
all
members
to
vote
providing
they
were
in
good
standing.
and
from
1938
down
to
the
present
time,
the
union
administration
has
been
reelected
over
and
over
and
over
again
by
votes
ranging
from
seven
to
one
to
ten
to
one
to
sometimes
where
there
has
been
no
opposition.
our
query
is
that
overwhelming
vote
of
confidence
come
as
a
result
of
a
press
of
tactics,
as
a
result
of
scheme
and
a
device
whereby
one
avoids
the
picture
--
the
clear
intent
of
the
congressional
legislation
or
does
that
overwhelming
vote
come
because
the
membership
is
cognizant
to
the
fact
that
it
has
achieved
such
tremendous
gains
under
the
leadership.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
and
may
i
quote
mr.
justice
brennan
on
that
point.
mr.
justice
brennan
said
in
153,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
weighed
how
best
to
legislate
against
revealed
abuses
in
union
elections
without
departing
needlessly
from
its
long
standing
policy
against
unnecessary
governmental
intrusion
into
internal
union
affairs.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
nobody
could
have
a
stated
that
more
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
i
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i
wish
that
i've
written
it.
i
think
it's
stated
as
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
now
the
thought
that
i
have
is
that
the
congress
enacted
two-pronged
legislation
here.
congress
balanced
it.
congress
was
determined
as
it
should
have
been
determined
to
correct
union
abuses
and
it
stated
what
those
union
abuses
were
and
it
categorized
them
and
then
on
the
other
hand,
it
said
we
don't
want
to
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
trade
union.
we
leave
it
to
reasonable
man
to
decide
what
is
reasonable
and
it's
when
something
is
clearly
unrelated
to
a
lawful
union
objective
that
the
courts
and
the
secretary
should
interfere.
i'm
sorry
sir.
may
i
ask
to
your
question
now?
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
they
all
work
in
dining
room.
that's
the
waiters
union.
you
see,
they
don't
have
the
same
kind
of
problems
we
have
and
that's
waiters
--
there's
enough
hotel
waiters
so
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
the
waiters
union.
it's
called
the
waiters
union.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that's
the
luncheonette
union.
we
deal
--
deal
only
with
the
hotel
workers
and
of
the
club
workers.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i
don't
know
but
let
me
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
does
or
it
does
not.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
but
let
me
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
judge
--
it
does
not
follow
it
and
my
associate
here
tells
me
that
but
let
me
discuss
this
whole
question
of
comparison
since
you've
raised
the
point.
the
government
has
asked
the
court
to
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
other
unions
don't
have
that
kind
of
requirement
but
that
is
a
prior
experience
requirement.
the
record
shows
that
there
are
40,000
local
unions
in
the
united
states
that
report
to
the
department
of
labor.
out
of
that
40,000,
200
constitutions
were
analyzed
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
which
leave
some
39,800
bylaw,
sets
of
bylaws
not
examined.
further
than
that,
reference
is
made
to
76
international
constitutions
of
which
only
one
iotw
contains
a
prior
office
holding
requirement.
our
international
union,
the
hotel
international
is
listed
as
one
of
those
organizations
or
internationals
which
doesn't
have
a
prior
office
holding
requirement.
yet,
the
record
shows
here
that
25%
or
more
of
the
local
unions
in
our
international
union
which
does
not
have
a
prior
office
holding
or
a
prior
experience
requirement
do
have
a
rule
somewhat
similar
to
ours.
in
other
words,
sensible
and
i
say
somewhat
similar
prior
experience
requirement.
in
other
words,
an
analysis
of
the
record
shows
how
unreliable
a
guide,
an
analysis
of
200
local
bylaws
may
be
or
the
international
bylaws
maybe.
in
other
words,
we
can't
rely
on
statistics
alone.
we
have
to
take
into
consideration,
what
is
the
situation
which
confronts
the
union
that's
in
the
court
today.
why
did
they
do
what
they
did?
was
it
because
there
was
a
sinister
purpose
by
a
group
of
people
to
perpetuate
themselves
in
office?
did
they
have
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
congress
is
going
to
pass
legislation
in
1959
and
how
could
they
circumvent
legislation
or
was
it
related
to
a
genuine
desire
of
the
rank
and
file
members
of
the
union
to
see
that
a
union
is
large
and
is
complex
as
this
and
as
many
problems
they
had,
govern
themselves
properly.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
with
the
further
exception
which
you
quoted
before
justice
fortas.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
justice
fortas,
let
me
meet
that
burden
which
you've
stated
and
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
meet
it
on
the
assumption
that
presides
imposes
a
heavy
burden
on
us.
yes,
i
think
it
does
impose
a
heavy
burden
but
we've
met
it.
we
have
here
a
requirement
which
resulted
in
a
pool
of
1700
candidates
who
could
very
easily
be
nominated
for
office.
there
are
1700
old
timers.
1700
people
who
take
active
part
in
the
union.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
5%.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
i'm
going
to
go
to
that
in
just
a
moment
but
there
are
1700
people
who
could
run
with
four
principle
offices
and
21
associated
offices.
just
remember,
we're
talking
about
31
candidates
per
office
in
an
entire
union
and
if
an
opposition
slate
can't
find
31
people
to
nominate
out
of
1700,
either
the
union
is
doing
something
right
or
the
opposition
is
doing
something
wrong
but
let
me
go
a
step
further.
if
the
congress
had
wanted
to
set
down
a
set
of
rules
in
a
clear
and
unequivocal
language
that
said
that
every
member
of
the
union
shall
be
eligible
to
run
for
office.
it
would
have
said
so.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
alright,
then
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
i'm
not
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i'm
sorry,
sir.
let
me
apply
to
our
own
union.
first,
we
are
proud
to
be
what
is
known
as
an
open
union.
in
other
words,
anybody
can
become
a
member
of
our
union
after
30
days
in
the
industry.
we
don't
have
a
close
union.
secondly,
we
have
a
union
that
has
peculiar
membership.
we
have
a
great,
many
unskilled
workers
who
were
there
for
a
very
short
period
because
they're
constantly
trying
to
use
this
as
a
stepping
stone.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
we
take
in
all
the
dining
room
employees,
all
the
kitchen
employees,
the
housekeeping
employees,
the
laundry
employees,
the
club
employees
in
every
club
in
new
york
city
such
as
--
even
including
telephone
operators,
upholsterers.
in
general,
every
employee
in
a
hotel
that
comes
within
the
dining
crafts,
the
service
crafts
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
dishwashers,
yes.
we
take
in
the
dishwashers,
we
take
in
the
chefs,
we
take
in
the
kitchen
workers
in
general,
the
miscellaneous
employees.
it's
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
yes,
many
of
them
are
uneducated.
we
have
a
large
precaution
of
negro
and
puerto
rican
membership.
in
this
union,
many
of
them
have
always
been
in
the
leadership
of
the
union
and
incidentally
justice
black,
if
you
lead
me
to
a
point
that
i
should
like
to
discuss,
there
is
a
provision
on
the
chart
which
mr.
weinstein
has
showed
which
provides
that
it's
possible
for
an
appointment
of
a
vice
president
and
the
question
rises
why
should
there
be
a
possible
appointment
of
a
right
vice
president.
i
think
you
raised
the
question
mr.
justice
white.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
we
try
to
make
sure
that
from
the
beginning
of
our
organization
down
to
the
present
time
since
we
have
a
large
number
of
women
who
are
members
of
the
union,
generally
in
the
housekeeping
department
that
there
would
always
be
at
least
one
woman
in
the
leadership
of
the
office
--
of
the
union.
secondly,
we
have
a
large
number
of
negro
workers
and
we
try
to
make
sure
that
we
would
always
have
at
least
one
negro
among
the
leadership.
fortunately,
in
the
30
years
that
we've
conducted
elections,
it's
never
been
necessary
for
the
assembly
to
exercise
its
right
to
appoint
a
vice
president
to
represent,
shall
we
say,
either
a
minority
group
or
a
woman.
they've
always
been
elected
in
general.
that's
the
reason
for
the
reserve
provision
in
the
constitution
to
make
sure
that
every
element
in
the
union
could
be
represented.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
we
have
no
educational
requirement
but
we
have
sir,
fortunately,
a
great
many
people
who
are
passing
through
the
union
and
that
they
are
working
their
way
through
college,
a
law
school,
a
medical
school
that
may
get
their
jobs
in
the
banquet
department
or
as
a
waiter.
we
have
a
number
of
actresses
who
are
quite
--
who
--
when
they're
unemployed,
get
jobs,
working
on
the
clubs
or
the
hotels.
so
that
we
have
a
fairly
literate
group
combined
with
the
group
of
less
educational
background.
it's
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
people.
we
are
little
cosmos
of
our
own.
i
think
if
you
read
the
record,
you
will
find
that
the
union
spokesman,
dedicated
and
articulate
and
that
their
whole
set
of
bylaws
had
been
designed
so
as
to
get
as
close
to
an
ideal
system
enforcing
a
representation
as
you
can
find.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
no.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
although
it
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
no
justice
black.
those
people
are
all
professionally
hired.
we
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no.
the
secretary
is
elected
from
the
membership.
this
is
traditional.
the
secretary
has
always
been
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
oh,
as
the
secretary-treasurer
whose
duties
are
to
handle
the
funds
of
the
union.
the
funds
amount
to
several
million
dollars
but
he
gets
this
guidance
on
that
from
certified
public
accountants,
from
an
ibm
machine.
we
had
ibm
machines
installed
20
years
ago.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no
experience
in
the
union,
no
special
qualification.
experience
in
union
matters.
there
are
no
special
qualifications
for
that.
just
his
special
dedication
to
union
matters.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
claim
anywhere
that
secretaries
or
treasurers
need
have
any
special
educational
requirements.
we're
fortunate
that
we
have
very
good
ones
but
there
is
no
real
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
it's
true
in
as
such,
the
membership
to
reject
them
or
accept
them.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
they
get
acquainted
with
one
another
because
they
live
in
the
same
community.
we
published
the
newspaper
for
the
last
30
years.
we
have
very
frequent
committee
meetings
and
membership
meetings
and
we
try
--
all
our
officers
try
and
take
advantage
of
the
union
fold
to
use
a
forum
and
that's
where
we
introduce
our
various
programs
of
participation
in
community
activity.
somehow
rather
in
the
world
in
which
we
live,
you
get
to
know
the
qualifications
of
the
people.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
the
hotel
world.
it's
the
26,000
people
who
work
in
hotels.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
all
over
new
york
city,
justice
black.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
it's
--
it's
difficult.
it's
the
same
problem
as
posed
universally.
we
do
have
very
frequent
committee
meetings
at
union
headquarters.
the
business
agents
and
the
general
officers
visit
the
hotels
frequently.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
they
are
the
officers,
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
let's
take
what
happened
in
this
particular
case,
they
publish
leaflets,
they
have
headquarters,
they
solicit
membership
throughout
the
hotels.
they
exploit
grievances
if
there
are
grievances
to
be
exploited.
i
think
it's
a
normal
course
of
--
you
just
have
to
make
your
own
value
of
judgment
about
the
qualifications
of
the
people
whom
you're
interested
in.
no
more
than
i
--
than
i
could
become
acquainted
with
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
candidates
for
president
of
the
united
states,
of
the
u.s.
senate.
i
just
have
to
read
about
them,
use
my
own
judgment
and
i
do
because
i'm
interested
in
the
general
situation.
union
members
are
interested
in
the
union
situation
somehow
or
rather
they
get
to
know
the
people
who
have
leadership.
it's
a
natural
process.
excuse
me
sir.
and
this
incidentally
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
should
be
some
qualification
so
that
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
should
have
some
qualifications.
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
the
point
of
your
question
sir.
let
me
go
on
to
what
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
let
me
tell
you
why
we
have
dispensed
it.
first,
it
was
an
experience
of
qualification
but
we
dispense
of
it
because
when
the
secretary
call
to
our
attention,
this
issue
was
challenged.
we
conducted
a
very
exhaustive
examination
of
our
records
to
the
first
time
since
1951
to
see
what
the
factual
situation
was.
and
we
found
that
there
was
a
pool
of
1700
people.
we
paid
for
the
experts
that
came
in,
we
analyze
the
records,
we
cooperated
with
the
secretary
and
we
did
everything
that
we
could
because
we
wanted
to
know
what's
right
and
what's
wrong
and
we
said
that
1700
for
31
offices
are
certainly
reasonable
but
then
the
question
came
up,
what's
going
to
happen
five
years
from
now?
what's
going
to
happen
10
years
from
now?
a
lot
of
people
will
pass
out
of
the
union
scene
because
of
death,
illness,
retirement,
attrition
generally
and
we
might
be
left
with
a
situation
that
would
be
completely
unreasonable
and
the
question
came
and
i'm
very
frank
to
state
to
the
court.
some
people
said
that
if
we
amend
our
bylaws
now,
it
might
be
a
confession
of
weakness.
on
the
other
hand,
our
union
leadership
said
nonsense.
we
run
this
union
for
the
benefit
of
the
members.
if
we
have
a
situation
that
should
be
correct
for
the
future,
let's
correct
it.
so
in
december
of
1966,
we
did
what
we've
done
many,
many
times
in
the
past,
and
that
is
amend
our
bylaws
so
that
it
would
be
not
only
in
consonance
with
the
spirit
of
legislation
and
the
spirit
of
good
trade
unionism
but
with
the
letter
as
well.
and
so
we
amended
our
bylaws
in
december
of
1966
of
the
next
election
which
is
going
to
take
place
two
weeks
from
now
will
be
conducted
under
a
situation
where
there
will
be
a
pool
of
17,000
people
eligible
to
be
nominated
for
office.
that
is
in
addition
to
the
old
requirement
which
we
still
have
which
makes
prior
office
--
prior
experience
desired.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
there's
going
to
be
an
opposition
slate,
they
have
nominated
for
our
position.
i
have
the
newspaper
here.
they've
operated
four
candidates
for
general
office
and
they've
nominated
i
think
eight
other
candidates
out
of
the
31
and
the
opposition
slate
will
probably
conduct
the
same
kind
of
campaign
that
they
conduct
the
last
time.
let
me
advert
to
the
10,000
--
sorry
sir.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
those
who
have
not
been
members
of
the
union
for
five
years.
in
other
words,
those
are
the
only
once
who
constitute
the
ineligibles.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
under
the
new
bylaws.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no.
under
the
old
one
--
under
the
one
which
the
1965
election
was
held,
there
were
1700
people
and
only
1700
people
who
satisfied
the
prior
experience
requirement.
under
the
new
bylaws
in
addition
to
those
people,
there
are
now
a
total
17,000
who
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no.
that
is
one
year
requirement
for
running
for
office.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
one
year.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
sorry.
two
years.
i'm
sorry
justice
fortas,
mr.
lurie
corrected
me.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
no,
no.
no.
we
have
raise
to
--
for
holding
general
office
for
five
years.
but
the
membership
and
the
assembly,
anybody
who
has
been
in
the
union
for
one
year
is
eligible
to
run
for
the
assembly.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that's
right.
not
being
an
officer
in
the
assembly.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
for
the
top
officer
--
no.
let
me
see
if
i
can
straighten
that
up.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
it
was
a
continuous
good
standing
for
two
years
under
the
old
bylaw.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
two
years
of
continuous
good
standing
but
five
years
membership
in
the
union.
in
other
words,
one
may
be
a
member
of
the
union
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
if
the
two
years
of
good
standing
were
immediately
proceed
until
the
time
when
you're
running
for
office.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
i
think
impressive
is
almost
as
difficult
to
define
as
reasonable.
may
i
just
add
to
one
question
and
this
is
about
the
10,000
people
who
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
a
man
may
be
a
member
of
a
union
and
not
pay
his
dues.
that's
the
only
thing
that
makes
some
bad
standing.
anybody
is
in
good
standing
if
he
pays
his
dues
properly.
especially
on
the
qualification.
there
are
no
reprisals
here.
there
are
no
claims
of
reprisals
of
kicking
people
out
and
anything
of
that
sort.
it
just
doesn't
exist.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes,
that's
all.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
and
people
generally
pay
their
dues
because
there
are
substantial
pension
and
medical
plans
so
that
we
don't
have
very
much
of
a
problem
on
that.
it's
just
theoritical
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that's
true.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
now,
that's
true.
i
think
you
brought
it
accurately.
and
i
--
i
may
not
have
answered
it
clearly
but
you've
read
it
accurately
sir.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no,
of
course
not.
may
i
adjust
myself
of
the
10
--
of
the
nature
of
the
10,000
people.
we
do
have
a
large
turnover
because
people
come
into
the
industry
in
the
unskilled
job.
that's
one
of
the
group
that
comes
in
and
it
would
be
wrong
in
our
view
to
just
make
it
possible
for
people
who
drift
in
and
out
of
the
industry
in
these
unskilled
jobs
to
be
entrusted
with
the
leadership
of
so
complex
a
structure
as
ours.
secondly,
we
have
in
the
union
a
number
of
people
who
come
in
as
i've
indicated
on
a
very
temporary
basis
and
that
is
the
young
law
student
or
the
young
medical
student
who
is
trying
to
earn
a
living
while
he's
at
school
and
he
is
going
to
drift
out
of
the
union
and
while
we
welcome
their
participation
in
union
affairs
when
they're
in
the
union,
they're
going
to
go
out.
thirdly,
we
have
a
number
of
classes
that
come
in
where
people
want
training
in
the
union.
they
eventually
expect
to
be
hotel
managers
or
restaurant
operators,
it's
a
great
training
ground
so
that
they
drift
in
or
out
for
two
or
three
years
in
order
to
get
experience.
we
feel
that
it's
reasonable
in
our
situation
under
our
new
bylaws
to
require
a
minimum
of
five
years
and
that's
why
there
may
be
a
group
of
people
within
that
membership
period
of
drifting
in
and
out
almost
10,000
people
who
are
not
eligible
in
our
opinion
to
qualify
for
office
but
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
sorry
sir.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
because
it
gives
the
feel
of
the
union.
first,
it
will
take
you
through
a
couple
of
collective
bargaining
processes.
it
will
give
one
a
chance
to
show
to
his
fellow
members
that
he
is
interested
in
the
work
of
the
union.
we
have
dozens
and
dozens
of
committees
in
which
people
served.
we
have
educational
programs
in
which
people
participate
and
we
feel
that
somebody
before
he
submits
himself
to
the
membership
office,
at
least
has
to
get
the
smell
of
the
union.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
any.
we're
talking
of
the
31
general
offices.
i
mean,
we're
talking
of
the
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that
is
for
the
president,
the
general
organizers,
the
secretary-treasurer
and
the
recording
treasurer.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that's
all
that's
included
among
the
31
offices.
now
remember,
membership
in
the
assembly
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no.
plus
the
business
agents,
plus
the
business
agents
and
the
seven
vice
presidents.
there
are
only
31
offices
have
to
recruit.
now,
anybody
who
have
to
have
these
requirements
--
now
anybody
is
eligible
to
run
for
the
assembly
if
he
has
been
in
the
union
for
one
year.
now,
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
here
about
the
fact
that
they
can't
be
elected
unless
they
are
part
of
the
administration
caucus
or
the
administration
slate.
let
me
refer
to
that
for
a
moment.
we
have
a
very
successful
record.
the
opposition
hasn't
been
elected
but
that's
not
a
sin.
the
opposition
hasn't
been
elected
because
as
judge
wyatt
found,
they
have
no
program
to
offer
to
the
membership
while
the
administration
has
a
very
successful
problem
to
offer
to
the
membership.
about
coming
to
the
caucus,
if
i
call
mr.
weinstein's
argument
logically,
he
would
expect
mr.
kennedy
would
invite
mr.
humphrey
to
send
delegates
to
mr.
kennedy's
caucus
to
plan
out
--
to
plan
how
mr.
kennedy
was
going
to
be
elected
for
office
or
mr.
goldwater
would
want
to
come
to
mr.
johnson's
caucus
so
that
he
could
be
represented
at
mr.
johnson's
caucus.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
now,
the
secretary
has
been
very
fair
in
his
presentations
to
the
court
through
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
really
know
what
he
wants,
that
he
hasn't
had
enough
experience
with
this
whole
question
of
prior
experience
and
prior
office
holding.
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
when
ambassador
goldberg
was
the
secretary,
he
had
enough
expertise
and
he
had
enough
knowledge
to
issue
a
couple
of
interpretative
bulletins
which
were
just
made
available
to
us
as
a
result
to
the
public
disclosure
act
only
recently.
let
me
tell
you
the
two
criteria
that
ambassador
goldberg
relied
on
in
1960
when
he
published
two
interpretive
ruling.
these
are
found
in
the
lmrda
interpretive
manual,
section
422.250
and
section
422.270.
they're
cited
in
our
supplemental
brief.
this
is
what
justice
goldberg
--
excuse
me,
ambassador
goldberg
said
on
august
25,
1960,
“participation
in
union
affairs,
qualifications
reasonably
designed
to
assure
that
candidates
had
participated
in
the
affairs
in
the
union
and
are
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
industry
in
which
the
union
operates
would
not
be
considered
unreasonable
and
ordinary
circumstances
if
uniformly
opposed.
in
the
absence
of
knowledge
of
any
special
circumstances
which
cast
out
upon
the
validity
and
reasonableness
of
any
of
the
qualifications,
they
are
not
to
be
considered
unreasonable
in
themselves.”
now,
take
our
situation
here
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
that's
dated
august
25,
1960.
it's
recorded
in
the
lmrda
interpretive
manual
of
u.s.
department
of
labor.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
august
25,
1960.
does
he
mention?
i'm
sorry.
i
apologize.
i'll
take
secretary
mitchell
who
was
--
who
had
great
expertise
in
this
field
and
was
appointed
secretary
of
labor.
with
that,
i
see
i've
loss
track
of
my
history.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
thank
you
sir.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
in
a
very
short
time
that
i
have
left
in
me
to
get
to
the
considerations
of
the
question
whether
or
not,
the
outcome
of
the
election
would
have
been
affected
if
the
rule
were
improper.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
of
justice
wyatt
or
judge
wyatt
on
that
point
which
is
sighted
at
page
48
of
our
brief.
he
said,
“consideration
has
been
given
not
merely
to
the
effect
of
the
bylaw
on
those
disqualified
but
to
its
possible
effect
in
discouraging
others
from
coming
forward
as
opposing
candidates.
nonetheless,
the
heavy
vote
in
favor
of
the
administration
candidates
is
convincing
that
the
existence
and
enforcement
of
the
bylaw
could
not
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
the
evidence
satisfies
me
that
the
primary
reason
for
the
heavy
vote
in
favor
of
the
administration
was
a
lack
of
any
real
grievance
or
issue
against
the
union
management.
the
platform
of
the
opposition
membership
party
did
not
charge
any
abuses
or
misconduct
or
even
any
inefficiency.
there
was
no
attempt
to
state
any
specific
complaints.
there
was
no
dramatic
or
important
issue
to
route
the
membership
against
the
incumbents.
the
appeal
that
the
opposition
was
in
substance
that
it
could
do
the
job
better.
now,
that
also
was
concurred
in
by
judge
dimock
sitting
as
a
member
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
why
it
was
it
necessary?
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
the
bylaw
had
been
established
15
years
--
eight
years
before
the
legislation
in
question
and
had
been
historically
in
the
bylaw
for
--
since
the
union
was
charged
that
the
prior
experience
was
--
but
judge
black,
please
forgive
me.
i
just
have
a
few
moments
to
discuss
the
preponderance
--
the
statute
itself
but
i
don't
want
to
address
myself
at
this
point
to
the
reasonableness.
your
honor
may
feel
that
it's
against
us.
i
feel
that
it
so
strongly
supports
the
reason
why
the
election
would
not
have
been
affected
if
the
bylaw
had
been
in
there
or
not
been
in
there
and
that
is
an
important
part
of
the
statute
as
any
other
part
of
the
statute.
the
statute
reads
that
it's
the
secretary's
burden
to
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
different
if
the
bylaw
hadn't
been
there.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
may
have
been,
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
may
have
affected,
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
there
is
a
--
well,
there
is
a
difference
but
there
has
to
be
a
probability
that
might
have
been
affected.
remember
the
fact
to
a
situation
here
mr.
justice
brennan.
you
have
the
four
candidates
including
the
two
who
had
been
disqualified
for
running
for
general
office
actually
submit
themselves
to
the
vote
of
the
membership
because
they
were
candidates
for
delegates
to
the
international
convention.
they
were
defeated
by
votes
of
seven
to
one,
so
that
we
did
have
an
election,
the
membership
did
express
itself.
their
statute
calls
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
now,
they
must
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
it
may
have
been
--
that
the
outcome
may
have
been
affected.
now,
what
is
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
they
produce
no
evidence
of
any
kind.
certainly,
the
words
“preponderance
of
the
evidence
must
be
given
some
statutory
meeting.”
now,
when
that's
taken
into
consideration
with
the
fact
that
the
legislation
that
this
court
has
set
forth
so
many
times
in
the
various
opinions
was
not
designed
to
make
the
trade
union
unharmed
of
the
government
but
it
was
designed
to
keep
the
union's
free
and
independent
and
that
the
regulations
were
only
those
which
dealt
with
abuses.
i
think
that
you
cannot
read
out
of
the
statute
the
clear
words
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
the
burden
of
the
secretary
can
prove
that
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
secretary
is
asking
this
court
my
opinion
to
give
a
construction
to
the
statute
which
would
completely
nullify
the
words
which
the
congress
was
so
careful
to
put
into
it.
now,
i
can't
concede
of
any
situation
if
we
are
to
follow
the
secretary's
argument
whereby
automatically
if
a
bylaw
is
found
unreasonable,
it
doesn't
then
become
necessary
to
declare
the
election
void
and
to
order
a
supervised
election.
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
the
congress
wanted
to
prevent
abuses.
it
did
prevent
abuses.
congress
wanted
to
keep
the
unions
free
to
regulate
their
own
internal
affairs.
i
think
it
did
and
when
we
consider
the
factors,
one
of
the
justices
today
indicated
that
it
can't
be
the
intention
of
the
secretary
to
go
into
40,000
separate
sets
of
bylaws
or
to
compel
a
union
as
i
would
interpret
that
to
risk
an
election
which
cost
$25,000
or
$30,000
in
that
case
and
then
worry
as
to
whether
years
later
the
secretary
may
adopt
the
standard
which
is
going
to
outlaw
the
election.
i
don't
think
that
we
could
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i
think
that
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
which
would
have
to
be
followed.
and
may
i
address
myself
in
just
two
or
three
minutes
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
and
what
are
these
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
no.
because
if
--
the
two
decisions
that
you
read
--
that
you
quote
are
the
decision
in
153
and
125,
and
those
two
situations
--
in
those
two
cases,
the
situation
is
completely
different
because
in
153,
the
supervening
election
was
under
the
old
bylaw
so
that
the
court
wouldn't
tolerate
a
situation
whereby
trick
and
device,
you
could
frustrate
the
clear
intent
of
the
legislation.
in
the
125,
the
election
was
conducted
under
--
it
was
the
conduct
of
the
election
that
was
improper.
the
charge
was
there
that
the
incumbent
officers
had
at
the
voting
list
so
that
their
favorites
could
vote
and
those
who
were
not
their
favorites
might
be
excluded.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
a
situation
here.
we
have
an
election
which
has
taken
place
under
a
bylaw
which
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
found
to
be
reasonable
and
where
we,
ourselves,
a
year-and-a-half
prior
to
the
election,
to
the
forthcoming
election
have
amended
the
bylaw
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
as
long
as
it
was
warranted.
but
the
question
is
whether
it
would
be
warranted
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you
is
a
complete
--
i
think
the
only
honest
answer
i
can
give
you
is
that
the
situation
is
different
under
which
the
two
elections
have
taken
place
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i
don't
think
it
is
foreclosed.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
glass
blowers
and
153
in
this
case.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes,
and
these
cases
have
to
be
decided
on
the
facts
because
the
secretary
asserted
this
argument,
we
don't
know
what
the
general
rule
is
we
haven't
laid
down
a
general
rule.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
right.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
not
if
the
court
so
orders
it.
may
i
tell
you
this
--
may
i
suggest
this
to
you.
the
congressional
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
because
the
question
is
whether
it's
necessary,
we'd
have
to
go
back
to
the
court,
i
assume
to
the
district
court
to
direct
in
terms
under
which
the
supervised
elections
could
be
held.
remember
here
that
we
are
not
talking
about
misconduct
in
the
election
or
any
of
the
specific
abuses.
we're
only
talking
about
the
application
of
the
rule.
the
supervised
--
permit
me
justice
fortas
if
i
may.
the
supervised
election
requires
that
it
would
be
held
under
the
rules
of
the
union
as
far
as
it's
practical
and
in
conformance
with
the
bylaws.
now,
where
we
have
amended
our
bylaws
and
where
i
don't
think
that
today,
there
has
been
any
serious
challenge,
the
way
you
have
17,000
people
eligible
to
hold,
to
run
for
office
of
31
people
clearly
under
what
bylaws
will
they
be
held?
we
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
really
nothing
for
the
secretary
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
i
would
suggest
that
we
would
--
should
be
entitled
to
our
day
in
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
new
bylaw
is
appropriate.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
then
may
i
say
that
i
think
the
statutory
scheme
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
yes,
but
i
also
think
that
the
secretary's
day
in
court
has
to
come
after
he
has
exhausted
the
procedure
which
the
statute
provides.
it's
a
very
difficult
situation.
i
doubt
i
haven't
answered
it
promptly.
we
all
have
problems
with
it.
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
i
think
that
just
playing
common
sense
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
of
where
the
old
election
which
we
are
talking
about
is
going
to
terminate
in
two
weeks
and
where
the
--
that
is
the
term
of
office
terminates
in
two
weeks
and
where
we
have
a
new
situation
where
the
new
election
is
not
taking
place
under
the
same
challenged
bylaw
but
under
a
different
set
of
bylaws
that
it
wasn't
the
intention
of
congress
to
make
chaos
out
of
order
but
it's
rather
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
then
i
failed.
i
think
that
we
are
making
a
strong
argument
for
the
mootness
in
this
particular
situation
where
we
have
a
situation
where
the
old
election
would
not
have
been
set
aside
because
it
hasn't
been
shown
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
a
different
bylaw
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
where
we
have
a
situation
where
the
new
election
will
provide
the
members
with
about
17,000
people
whom
they
may
choose
for
their
31
offices.
and
again,
i
come
back
to
the
fact
that
we
rely
on
our
basic
position
that
even
the
old
bylaw
had
a
legitimate
purpose
and
was
not
a
conspiratorial
purpose.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
i
think
that
the
court
has
definitely
prohibited
that
situation.
i
think
it
will
be
very
bad
if
it
happen.
and
i
think
that
the
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
that
couldn't
happen
under
bottle
blowers
and
nobody
would
want
to
have
it
happen.
i
just
say
that
that,
in
our
opinion,
doesn't
preclude
the
situation
of
a
union
doing
what
it
should
do
and
that
is
meet
the
dynamic
demands
of
its
membership
and
change
as
the
occasion
warrants
it.
that's
what
a
good
union
should
do.
our
amending
process
is
very
easy.
i
think
that
we
anticipated,
properly
anticipated
everything
that
a
descent
trade
union
ought
to
do
to
preserve
the
rights
of
its
membership.
it
wasn't
done
--
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
frankly
sir,
i
couldn't
see
it.
mr.
sidney
e.
cohn
well,
mr.
gold
is
going
to
argue
those
and
therefore
i
haven't
done
it
except
that
i
think
they're
really
minimal
when
you
get
into
it
and
look
at
the
record
as
to
what
they
wanted
to
prove.
but
mr.
gold
is
going
to
argue
that.
i
don't
want
to
trespass
on
his
time
on
that.
i
think
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you
very,
very
much.
