do
you
think
--
does
your
argument
carry
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
he
had
--
in
order
to
show
that
he
had
standing
on
his
motion
that
he
made
a
complete
confession
of
the
crime
that
it
would
be
unavailable
in
the
trial?
chief

mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
just
an
abstract
question
as
to
whether
this
were
--
came
under
the
jencks
act
or
did
they
argue
in
the
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
the
merits
of
whether
they
ought
to
be
entered.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
court
of
appeals?
did
they
argue
the
constitutional
question
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
why
the
judge
wouldn't
let
them
see
the
pictures
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
that
the
prosecution
was
willing
to
produce
the
pictures
but
the
court
said
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
am
i
wrong
on
my
recollection
that
the
prosecution
showed
the
pictures
to
the
witnesses
the
day
before
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
long?
was
it
in
a
matter
of

chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
they
disperse
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
lived
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
go
back
to
the
point,
i
assume,
that
but
it
was
not
compelled
to
be
given,
he
chose
to
give
it
in
a
proceeding
that
was
to
his
own
advantage
to
testify.

of
it.
it

here
there
is
nothing
in

jencks
act
which

not
a
part
of
the

as

are
defined
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
there
that
--
maybe
i
read
it
too
hastily
--
