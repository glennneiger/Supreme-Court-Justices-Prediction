mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
although
this
case
is
here
under
a
single
docket
number,
it
is
essentially
two
cases.
the
question
about
the
photographs
relates
to
the
petitioner,
simmons
only
and
i
believe
that
the
question
about
the
testimony
on
the
motion
to
suppress
relates
to
the
petitioner,
garrett
only,
because
it
was
only
admitted
against
him
and
referred
to
him
only.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
about
the
photographs,
i
think
the
issues
can
be
narrowed
somewhat.
no
question
is
raised
under
the
sixth
amendment
that
is
with
respect
to
the
right
to
counsel.
thus,
the
wade
decision
itself
is
not
applicable.
moreover,
the
trial
occurred
before
june
12,
1967
and
thus
under
the
stovall
case,
the
wade
decision
would
not
be
applicable
in
any
event.
that
means
that
the
sole
question
here
must
be
under
the
fifth
amendment
or
under
such
a
general
oversight
as
this
court
has
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
criminal
cases
in
the
federal
court.
as
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned,
it
would
seem
to
me,
i
must
confess,
i
find
it
a
little
hard
to
get
my
fingers
on
just
what
the
issue,
what
the
complaint
is
here
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
but
it
would
have
seem
to
me
that
this
case
is
a
fortiori
from
the
stovall
case.
if
the
circumstances
in
that
case
where
that
the
potential
defendant
was
brought
before
the
witness
manacled,
did
not
violate
due
process
as
this
court
held.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
violation
here.
there
was
nothing
essentially
unfair
in
this
matter.
indeed,
in
the
wade
opinion
itself,
the
court
referred
to
a
number
of
circumstances
which
might
remove
the
taint
from
an
improper
lineup
and
referred
to
the
identification
by
picture
of
the
defendant
prior
to
the
lineup
as
one
of
those
circumstances.
here,
the
pictures
were
used
before
the
arrest.
they
were
it
seems
to
me
the
consequence
of
a
good
police
work.because
of
the
white
thunderbird
automobile
with
a
long
scratch
on
its
side,
the
police
were
led
to
mrs.
mahon's
home
where
her
son,
andrews
either
lived
or
was
known.
they
went
there
and
gt
pictures.
they
took
the
pictures
to
the
employees
in
the
bank
the
same
afternoon
as
the
robbery.
and
let
me
point
out
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
bringing
in
pictures
is
not
merely
to
focus
attention
on
a
particular
accused
but
is
also
to
eliminate
persons
from
being
accused
and
in
order
to
make
more
efficient
the
activity
of
the
police.
these
pictures
were
used
before
the
arrest.
they
were
the
ordinary
and
natural
vehicle
of
a
good
police
work
under
the
circumstances.
there
were
here
no
prior
denials
of
identity
or
failures
to
identify.
the
witnesses
had
good
opportunities
to
see
the
defendants
over
an
appreciable
period
of
time
at
the
bank
during
a
holdup.
the
persons
who
carried
out
the
hold
up
were
not
masked
or
disguised
in
any
way.
the
several
witnesses
all
independently
agreed
on
the
identification.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
did
not
identify
the
prime
suspect
and
agreed
on
that
namely,
andrews.
andrews
was
never
identified
from
the
photographs
although
photographs
of
andrews
were
shown
to
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
actually,
we
have
no
very
good
information
about
that.
most
of
the
witnesses
seem
to
agree
that
there
were
five
or
six
photographs
although
one
of
them
on
page
30
of
the
records
says
20
and
one
of
them
on
page
25
of
the
records
says
50.
it
is
also
clear
that
there
were
more
than
one
photograph
each
of
both
simmons
and
of
andrews
and
it
also
appears
that
some
of
these
photographs
were
group
photographs
in
which
simmons
or
andrews
or
maybe
both
of
them
appeared
with
other
people.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
it
does
not
appear
that
any
of
them
were
but
let
me
point
out
again
that
this
was
on
the
afternoon
of
the
holdup
and
when
the
pictures
are
obtained,
these
were
available.
naturally,
a
police
officer
would
take
them
to
the
persons
who
had
witnessed
the
--
who
had
been
present
at
the
holdup
to
see
whether
they
were
on
a
likely
track.
incidentally,
there
is
also
here
no
suggestion
of
any
improper
motives
such
as
ranker
or
revenge.
the
prosecution
didn't
bring
the
pictures
into
the
case.
they
were
referred
to
by
counsel
for
the
defendants.
the
witnesses
identified
the
defendants
at
the
trial
and
were
fully
subject
to
cross-examination.
in
our
view,
the
weight
to
be
given
to
their
testimony
was
for
the
jury
to
weigh.
now,
the
chief
reference
to
the
pictures
at
the
trial
was
not
in
terms
of
the
fifth
amendment,
indeed
there's
--
i
believe
it
is
entirely
accurate
to
say
that
there
is
no
reference
certainly
in
the
printed
record
to
the
fifth
amendment
or
to
due
process
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
pictures
in
any
way
at
all.
the
reference
to
the
pictures
at
the
trial
was
entirely
in
terms
of
the
so-called
jencks
act,
which
is
set
out
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
and
which
requires
the
united
states
to
produce
any
statement
as
here
and
after
defined
of
the
witness
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
which
relates
to
the
subject
matter
as
to
which
the
witness
has
testified.
and
the
term
‘statement'
is
defined
in
the
statute
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
to
mean
‘a
written
statement
made
by
said
witness
and
signed
or
otherwise
adopted
or
approved
by
him
or
a
stenographic,
mechanical,
electrical
or
recording
or
a
transcription
which
is
substantially
a
verbatim
recital
of
an
oral
statement
and
recorded
contemporaneously
with
the
making
of
such
statement.
now,
it
is
quite
apparent
that
these
photographs
were
in
no
sense
any
part
of
a
statement
prepared
by
these
witnesses.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
that
the
producibility
is
not
confined
to
the
jencks
act.
i
fully
agree
with
that.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
court
in
this
case
could
if
it
had
thought
it
appropriate
have
required
the
production
of
the
pictures.
the
court
--
certainly,
no
effort
was
made
to
have
them
produced
apart
from
the
jencks
act.
the
reference
throughout
the
trial
is
to
i
want
them
under
3500
which
is
the
jencks
supervision
and
the
court
specifically
found
on
page
54
of
the
record
that
the
pictures
were
no
part
of
the
statements.
incidentally,
the
statements
were
given
on
february
27th,
the
day
of
the
robbery
and
the
witnesses
didn't
see
the
pictures
until
the
following
day,
february
28th,
so
it
is
entirely
obvious
that
the
pictures
are
no
part
of
the
statement.
it
is
equally
clear
to
me
that
the
court
could
have
required
the
production
of
the
pictures
had
there
been
any
reason
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
was
really
relevant
or
bore
on
the
fairness
of
the
identification.
here,
the
court
did
not
order
the
production
of
the
pictures.
nothing
was
shown
by
way
of
prejudice
to
indicate
or
even
suggest
that
that
was
wrong.
now,
we
have
another
point
in
the
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
only
question
that
was
ever
raised
at
the
trial
was
whether
this
came
under
the
jencks
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
has
not
been
brought
into
the
case
until
the
brief
in
this
court
and
the
argument
here
where
a
general
fifth
amendment
and
a
supervisory
oversight
of
the
court
has
been
referred
to
but
the
argument
made
in
the
district
court
was
confined
solely
to
appearance
--
to
production
under
the
jencks
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
believe
so
but
i'm
not
entirely
familiar
with
the
brief
which
were
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
action
with
respect
to
the
pictures
was
appropriate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
not,
your
honor.
he
repeatedly
called
for
their
production
under
the
jencks
act.
the
court
repeatedly
refused
to
and
finally
told
counsel
that
they
need
not
raise
the
question
again
with
respect
to
other
witnesses
because
they
would
not
--
he
would
not
order
them
to
be
produced
under
the
jencks
act.
it's
obvious
that
the
counsel
for
the
defense
wanted
the
pictures
in
order
to
use
them
in
some
way
in
connection
with
cross-examination
of
the
witnesses
but
the
specific
means
was
--
the
specific
gravamen
was
not
suggested.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
--
if
the
pictures
have
been
mug
shots,
if
they
had
themselves
been
suggestive
in
some
way
or
another,
i
can
imagine
how
it
could
have
been
useful
in
the
cross-examination
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
pictures
were
anything
of
that
sort
and
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary,
the
evidence
is
that
they
were
snapshots
and
that
they
were
obtained
from
the
sister
of
one
of
the
defendants
out
of
her
elbow.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
that
they
were
anything
except
snapshots,
and
to
some
extent
the
group
pictures
but
it
isn't
known
who
all
the
persons
were
in
the
groups.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
the
problem
was
to
find
the
pictures.
the
pictures
had
never
been
kept
together
in
one
place.
there
had
been
no
notice
before
the
trial
that
they
would
be
required.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
but
it's
my
understanding
that
they
sought
to
find
the
pictures
and
that
nobody
could
ever
come
up
with
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
think
it
was
no
longer
before
the
trial
than
that
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
matter
of
days.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
i
don't
know
what
pictures
were
shown
to
some
of
the
witnesses
some
time
before
the
trial.
i've
never
seen
the
pictures.
they're
not
in
the
record.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
which
arises
with
respect
to
the
petitioner,
garrett
the
question
of
the
interrelation
between
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment.
the
fact
that
the
testimony
which
garrett
gave
on
his
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
was
later
introduced
at
his
trial.
this
was
a
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
contents
of
one
of
the
suitcases
were
his
property.
i
would
like
to
present
first
what
i
would
call
the
direct
argument
which
is
that
in
a
matter
like
this,
the
defense
is
put
to
its
choice.
this
has
been
the
traditional
rule
even
in
cases
where
possession
alone
is
enough
to
convict.
it
has
been
followed
in
a
considerable
number
of
cases
in
the
lower
federal
courts
including
a
well-known
decision
by
judge
learned
hand.
in
jones
against
the
united
states
and
362
u.s.,
this
court
recognized
these
decisions
but
founded
unnecessary
to
pass
on
them.
since
in
that
case
it
held
that
the
defendant
as
an
invitee
or
licensee
of
the
premises
had
standing
to
raise
the
question
of
the
validity
of
a
search
warrant
which
the
court
then
went
on
to
hold
was
a
validly
issued.
on
the
basis
of
those
cases,
the
defendant
can
decide
whether
he
will
take
the
stand
or
not.
the
pressure
is
not
put
on
him
by
the
government
but
by
the
force
of
circumstances.
he
is
not
compelled
to
testify.
if
he
does
not
testify
nothing
can
be
used
against
him.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
chooses
to
testify
in
open
court
under
the
advice
of
counsel
then
the
evidence
so
produced
is
available
as
testimony
in
open
court
under
the
advice
of
counsel
ordinarily
is.
but
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
stronger
reason
for
accepting
the
evidence
which
is
that
the
claim
under
the
fourth
amendment
was
wholly
without
basis.
here,
the
search
was
of
premises
in
which
the
defendant
had
no
interest
whatever.
he
never
claimed
that
he
had
any
interest
in
the
premises
and
the
evidence
of
the
owner
of
the
premises
is
unequivocal
that
he
did
not.
this
appears
twice
in
the
record
on
page
21
and
on
page
61.
moreover,
the
search
was
consented
to
by
the
owner
of
the
premises.
this
was
the
testimony
of
the
fbi
agent
which
the
court
accepted
in
ruling
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
mrs.
mahon
“led
the
search”,
he
testified.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
garrett
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i've
suppose
that
would
come
within
the
jones
case.
if
he
--
if
they
were
there
with
her
permission,
he
was
a
licensee
and
under
the
jones
case
he
had
a
standing
with
respect
to
the
premises.
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there's
no
evidence
here
that
the
police
did
know
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
she
gives
permission
for
them
to
be
taken,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
the
suitcases
found
on
the
public
highway,
i
suppose
it
can
be
taken
without
a
search
warrant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it's
been
abandoned
then
it
might
well
be
regarded
that
the
suitcase
under
all
the
circumstances
had
been
abandoned.
it
seemed
very
unlikely
that
the
defendant
was
going
to
come
back
and
claim
it
in
the
immediate
future
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
lived
there
or
that
he
had
any
relationship
whatever
with
the
premises.
in
the
jones
case,
the
court
said
that
the
rule
of
standing
there
developed
“would
of
course
not
avail
those
who
by
virtue
of
their
wrongful
presence
cannot
invoke
the
privacy
of
the
premises
searched”.
and
just
last
term
in
warden
against
hayden,
this
court
said
that
“we
have
recognized
that
the
principal
object
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
protection
of
privacy
rather
than
of
property.”
here,
the
defendant
never
had
any
claimed
privacy
whatever
in
the
premises
involved.
he
left
his
property
without
any
authority
and
the
person
who
had
authority
over
the
premises
relinquished
it
without
any
claim
of
violation
of
the
premises.
by
relinquishing
control
over
the
suitcase,
garrett
surrendered
whatever
right
to
privacy
he
may
have
had
as
to
the
contents
or
at
least
subjected
it
to
the
actions
of
the
person
who
did
have
the
right
to
privacy
as
to
the
premises.
now,
as
i
thought
about
this
problem
which
is
not
an
easy
one,
i've
tried
to
find
the
way
to
test
it.
the
issue
is,
i
suppose,
whether
there
should
be
a
general
rule
that
testimony
given
by
a
defendant
on
a
motion
to
suppress
is
never
admissible
against
him
at
his
trial.
there
is
a
certain
appeal
for
that,
perhaps,
though
it
goes
far
beyond
anything
that
can
be
found
in
the
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
grants
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
you
will
recall
or
read
simply
nor
can
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
there's
nothing
there
that
says
that
evidence
which
was
not
compelled
cannot
be
used
just
because
the
defendant
deliberately
chose
to
give
it
for
his
own
advantage.
let
us
suppose
that
at
the
motion
to
suppress
the
defendant,
a
hypothetical
defendant
not
this
defendant
here.
the
defendant
testified
that
the
clothes
were
his
then
at
the
trial
he
chooses
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
and
he
testified
that
the
clothes
are
not
his.
in
such
a
case,
could
it
be
supposed
that
his
prior
inconsistent
testiony
could
not
be
used
to
impeach
his
testimony
at
the
trial?
but
if
it
can
be
so
used
would
not
that
be
using
his
prior
testimony
against
him?
and
if
it
could
be
used
there,
then
there
is
no
rule
against
using
testimony
on
a
motion
to
suppress
and
why
should
not
the
testimony
be
used
here
since
it
was
freely
given
in
open
court
under
the
advice
of
counsel?
if
this
question
is
to
be
decided,
it
should
be
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
is
really
caught
in
a
dilemma
not
in
one
where
his
claim
is
wholly
unsupported
even
on
his
own
testimony
as
is
the
case
here.
certainly,
the
ordinary
rule
is
the
testimony
given
under
--
without
compulsion
in
open
court
under
the
advice
of
counsel
is
to
be
regarded
as
responsibly
given
and
to
be
taken
seriously.
here,
the
claim
under
the
fourth
amendment
was
essentially
frivolous
and
the
question
of
putting
the
defendant
to
a
dilemma
between
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment
should
be
left
to
a
case
where
that
dilemma
is
really
presented
on
facts
which
give
it
substance.
garrett
could
not
succeed
on
a
motion
to
suppress
unless
his
privilege
had
been
invaded.
he
had
to
show
some
relationship
to
the
place
where
the
seizure
was
made.
he
was
never
able
to
show
this.
without
it,
the
fact
that
he
owned
the
suitcase
or
its
contents
never
became
material.
he
was
never
in
a
situation
or
the
giving
of
the
testimony
that
he
owned
the
contents
of
the
suitcase
would
entitle
him
to
have
the
evidence
suppressed.
i
am
puzzled
as
to
why
he
wanted
to
testify.
the
clear
fact
that
seems
to
me
here
is
that
if
garrett
had
not
testified
this
evidence
could
not
have
been
used.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
two
suitcases
were
seized
by
the
government
at
that
time
exhibit
three
and
exhibit
four.
garrett's
testimony
related
only
to
exhibit
four
and
exhibit
three
was
never
introduced
into
evidence.
there
was
nothing
to
connect
this
suitcase
with
garrett
except
his
own
testimony
and
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
he
was
put
to
any
dilemma.
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
sit
back
and
object
to
the
relevancy
of
the
evidence
if
as
and
when
the
government
somehow
or
rather
sought
to
introduce
it.
if
garrett
had
simply
refrained
from
giving
his
testimony,
the
evidence
couldn't
have
been
used
against
him.
therefore
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
there
is
nothing
to
connect
it
with
garrett
or
anyone
else.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
contents
were
clothes
and
some
money
wrappers,
i
believe.
the
contents
were
clearly
related
to
the
robbery.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
they
were
not
connected
with
any
of
the
defendant
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
any
of
the
defendants
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
they
could
under
the
facts
which
were
no
longer
them
at
the
time
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
whether
this
comes
within
a
hot
pursuit
situation
like
that
in
warden
against
hayden.
here,
it
wasn't
quite
so
hot
except
that
they
had
just
found
the
thunderbird
automobile.
they
knew
whose
it
was
and
they
went
immediately
to
that
house.
and
it
might
be
that
within
warden
against
hayden
this
would
be
within
that
scope.
the
fact
that
this
material
was
evidentiary
would
no
longer
precluded
from
being
seized
and
i
think
if
we
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
warden
against
hayden
might
have
been
enough
to
show
that
there
were
the
extraordinary
circumstances
here.
garrett
was
in
fact
under
no
compulsion
to
give
the
testimony.
he
chose
to
give
it
and
did
so
in
open
court
under
the
advice
of
counsel.
we
submit
that
the
evidence
he
so
gave
was
properly
used
at
this
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
testimony
that
he
owned
the
contents
of
the
suitcase
was
not
relevant
as
i
see
it
to
his
fourth
amendment
point.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
as
the
court
said
last
term
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
suppose
that
--
that
in
so
far
as
the
evidence
he
gave
at
the
suppression
hearing
was
relevant
to
the
question
of
suppression
that
it
would
not
be
admissible
at
the
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
then
there
would
be
a
heavy
barrier
against
the
making
of
the
claim
under
the
fourth
amendment.
perhaps,
i'm
wrong
on
that.
perhaps,
i've
conceded
too
much.
i
think
that
the
--
the
cases
to
which
i
referred
in
the
lower
courts
generally
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
--
it
would
be
admissible
in
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
don't
have
a
question
put
by
mr.
justice
fortas
because
the
evidence
given
at
the
motion
to
suppress
is
irrelevant
to
the
motion
to
suppress.
it
showed
neither
by
his
evidence
nor
by
any
other
evidence
that
he
had
any
valid
standing
with
respect
to
the
premises,
and
as
this
court
has
said
it
is
privacy
and
not
property
which
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
i
was
wrong
in
saying
that.
certainly,
the
fact
that
the
evidence
can
be
used
as
exactly
what
judge
learned
hand
decided
in
the
case
to
which
reference
is
made
in
the
jones
case,
sentenced
--
quoted
in
the
jones
case.
the
petitioner
is
bar
shrank
from
that
predicament
but
they
were
obliged
to
choose
one
horn
of
the
dilemma
would
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
evidence
if
given
would
be
admissible
at
their
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
the
position
and
that
is
the
view
which
has
been
taken
by
a
considerable
number
of
lower
federal
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
although
this
case
is
here
under
a
single
docket
number,
it
is
essentially
two
cases.
the
question
about
the
photographs
relates
to
the
petitioner,
simmons
only
and
i
believe
that
the
question
about
the
testimony
on
the
motion
to
suppress
relates
to
the
petitioner,
garrett
only,
because
it
was
only
admitted
against
him
and
referred
to
him
only.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
about
the
photographs,
i
think
the
issues
can
be
narrowed
somewhat.
no
question
is
raised
under
the
sixth
amendment
that
is
with
respect
to
the
right
to
counsel.
thus,
the
wade
decision
itself
is
not
applicable.
moreover,
the
trial
occurred
before
june
12,
1967
and
thus
under
the
stovall
case,
the
wade
decision
would
not
be
applicable
in
any
event.
that
means
that
the
sole
question
here
must
be
under
the
fifth
amendment
or
under
such
a
general
oversight
as
this
court
has
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
criminal
cases
in
the
federal
court.
as
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned,
it
would
seem
to
me,
i
must
confess,
i
find
it
a
little
hard
to
get
my
fingers
on
just
what
the
issue,
what
the
complaint
is
here
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
but
it
would
have
seem
to
me
that
this
case
is
a
fortiori
from
the
stovall
case.
if
the
circumstances
in
that
case
where
that
the
potential
defendant
was
brought
before
the
witness
manacled,
did
not
violate
due
process
as
this
court
held.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
violation
here.
there
was
nothing
essentially
unfair
in
this
matter.
indeed,
in
the
wade
opinion
itself,
the
court
referred
to
a
number
of
circumstances
which
might
remove
the
taint
from
an
improper
lineup
and
referred
to
the
identification
by
picture
of
the
defendant
prior
to
the
lineup
as
one
of
those
circumstances.
here,
the
pictures
were
used
before
the
arrest.
they
were
it
seems
to
me
the
consequence
of
a
good
police
work.because
of
the
white
thunderbird
automobile
with
a
long
scratch
on
its
side,
the
police
were
led
to
mrs.
mahon's
home
where
her
son,
andrews
either
lived
or
was
known.
they
went
there
and
gt
pictures.
they
took
the
pictures
to
the
employees
in
the
bank
the
same
afternoon
as
the
robbery.
and
let
me
point
out
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
bringing
in
pictures
is
not
merely
to
focus
attention
on
a
particular
accused
but
is
also
to
eliminate
persons
from
being
accused
and
in
order
to
make
more
efficient
the
activity
of
the
police.
these
pictures
were
used
before
the
arrest.
they
were
the
ordinary
and
natural
vehicle
of
a
good
police
work
under
the
circumstances.
there
were
here
no
prior
denials
of
identity
or
failures
to
identify.
the
witnesses
had
good
opportunities
to
see
the
defendants
over
an
appreciable
period
of
time
at
the
bank
during
a
holdup.
the
persons
who
carried
out
the
hold
up
were
not
masked
or
disguised
in
any
way.
the
several
witnesses
all
independently
agreed
on
the
identification.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
did
not
identify
the
prime
suspect
and
agreed
on
that
namely,
andrews.
andrews
was
never
identified
from
the
photographs
although
photographs
of
andrews
were
shown
to
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
actually,
we
have
no
very
good
information
about
that.
most
of
the
witnesses
seem
to
agree
that
there
were
five
or
six
photographs
although
one
of
them
on
page
30
of
the
records
says
20
and
one
of
them
on
page
25
of
the
records
says
50.
it
is
also
clear
that
there
were
more
than
one
photograph
each
of
both
simmons
and
of
andrews
and
it
also
appears
that
some
of
these
photographs
were
group
photographs
in
which
simmons
or
andrews
or
maybe
both
of
them
appeared
with
other
people.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
it
does
not
appear
that
any
of
them
were
but
let
me
point
out
again
that
this
was
on
the
afternoon
of
the
holdup
and
when
the
pictures
are
obtained,
these
were
available.
naturally,
a
police
officer
would
take
them
to
the
persons
who
had
witnessed
the
--
who
had
been
present
at
the
holdup
to
see
whether
they
were
on
a
likely
track.
incidentally,
there
is
also
here
no
suggestion
of
any
improper
motives
such
as
ranker
or
revenge.
the
prosecution
didn't
bring
the
pictures
into
the
case.
they
were
referred
to
by
counsel
for
the
defendants.
the
witnesses
identified
the
defendants
at
the
trial
and
were
fully
subject
to
cross-examination.
in
our
view,
the
weight
to
be
given
to
their
testimony
was
for
the
jury
to
weigh.
now,
the
chief
reference
to
the
pictures
at
the
trial
was
not
in
terms
of
the
fifth
amendment,
indeed
there's
--
i
believe
it
is
entirely
accurate
to
say
that
there
is
no
reference
certainly
in
the
printed
record
to
the
fifth
amendment
or
to
due
process
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
pictures
in
any
way
at
all.
the
reference
to
the
pictures
at
the
trial
was
entirely
in
terms
of
the
so-called
jencks
act,
which
is
set
out
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
and
which
requires
the
united
states
to
produce
any
statement
as
here
and
after
defined
of
the
witness
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
which
relates
to
the
subject
matter
as
to
which
the
witness
has
testified.
and
the
term
‘statement'
is
defined
in
the
statute
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
to
mean
‘a
written
statement
made
by
said
witness
and
signed
or
otherwise
adopted
or
approved
by
him
or
a
stenographic,
mechanical,
electrical
or
recording
or
a
transcription
which
is
substantially
a
verbatim
recital
of
an
oral
statement
and
recorded
contemporaneously
with
the
making
of
such
statement.
now,
it
is
quite
apparent
that
these
photographs
were
in
no
sense
any
part
of
a
statement
prepared
by
these
witnesses.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
that
the
producibility
is
not
confined
to
the
jencks
act.
i
fully
agree
with
that.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
court
in
this
case
could
if
it
had
thought
it
appropriate
have
required
the
production
of
the
pictures.
the
court
--
certainly,
no
effort
was
made
to
have
them
produced
apart
from
the
jencks
act.
the
reference
throughout
the
trial
is
to
i
want
them
under
3500
which
is
the
jencks
supervision
and
the
court
specifically
found
on
page
54
of
the
record
that
the
pictures
were
no
part
of
the
statements.
incidentally,
the
statements
were
given
on
february
27th,
the
day
of
the
robbery
and
the
witnesses
didn't
see
the
pictures
until
the
following
day,
february
28th,
so
it
is
entirely
obvious
that
the
pictures
are
no
part
of
the
statement.
it
is
equally
clear
to
me
that
the
court
could
have
required
the
production
of
the
pictures
had
there
been
any
reason
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
was
really
relevant
or
bore
on
the
fairness
of
the
identification.
here,
the
court
did
not
order
the
production
of
the
pictures.
nothing
was
shown
by
way
of
prejudice
to
indicate
or
even
suggest
that
that
was
wrong.
now,
we
have
another
point
in
the
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
only
question
that
was
ever
raised
at
the
trial
was
whether
this
came
under
the
jencks
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
has
not
been
brought
into
the
case
until
the
brief
in
this
court
and
the
argument
here
where
a
general
fifth
amendment
and
a
supervisory
oversight
of
the
court
has
been
referred
to
but
the
argument
made
in
the
district
court
was
confined
solely
to
appearance
--
to
production
under
the
jencks
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
believe
so
but
i'm
not
entirely
familiar
with
the
brief
which
were
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
action
with
respect
to
the
pictures
was
appropriate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
not,
your
honor.
he
repeatedly
called
for
their
production
under
the
jencks
act.
the
court
repeatedly
refused
to
and
finally
told
counsel
that
they
need
not
raise
the
question
again
with
respect
to
other
witnesses
because
they
would
not
--
he
would
not
order
them
to
be
produced
under
the
jencks
act.
it's
obvious
that
the
counsel
for
the
defense
wanted
the
pictures
in
order
to
use
them
in
some
way
in
connection
with
cross-examination
of
the
witnesses
but
the
specific
means
was
--
the
specific
gravamen
was
not
suggested.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
--
if
the
pictures
have
been
mug
shots,
if
they
had
themselves
been
suggestive
in
some
way
or
another,
i
can
imagine
how
it
could
have
been
useful
in
the
cross-examination
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
pictures
were
anything
of
that
sort
and
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary,
the
evidence
is
that
they
were
snapshots
and
that
they
were
obtained
from
the
sister
of
one
of
the
defendants
out
of
her
elbow.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
that
they
were
anything
except
snapshots,
and
to
some
extent
the
group
pictures
but
it
isn't
known
who
all
the
persons
were
in
the
groups.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
the
problem
was
to
find
the
pictures.
the
pictures
had
never
been
kept
together
in
one
place.
there
had
been
no
notice
before
the
trial
that
they
would
be
required.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
but
it's
my
understanding
that
they
sought
to
find
the
pictures
and
that
nobody
could
ever
come
up
with
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
think
it
was
no
longer
before
the
trial
than
that
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
matter
of
days.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
i
don't
know
what
pictures
were
shown
to
some
of
the
witnesses
some
time
before
the
trial.
i've
never
seen
the
pictures.
they're
not
in
the
record.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
which
arises
with
respect
to
the
petitioner,
garrett
the
question
of
the
interrelation
between
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment.
the
fact
that
the
testimony
which
garrett
gave
on
his
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
was
later
introduced
at
his
trial.
this
was
a
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
contents
of
one
of
the
suitcases
were
his
property.
i
would
like
to
present
first
what
i
would
call
the
direct
argument
which
is
that
in
a
matter
like
this,
the
defense
is
put
to
its
choice.
this
has
been
the
traditional
rule
even
in
cases
where
possession
alone
is
enough
to
convict.
it
has
been
followed
in
a
considerable
number
of
cases
in
the
lower
federal
courts
including
a
well-known
decision
by
judge
learned
hand.
in
jones
against
the
united
states
and
362
u.s.,
this
court
recognized
these
decisions
but
founded
unnecessary
to
pass
on
them.
since
in
that
case
it
held
that
the
defendant
as
an
invitee
or
licensee
of
the
premises
had
standing
to
raise
the
question
of
the
validity
of
a
search
warrant
which
the
court
then
went
on
to
hold
was
a
validly
issued.
on
the
basis
of
those
cases,
the
defendant
can
decide
whether
he
will
take
the
stand
or
not.
the
pressure
is
not
put
on
him
by
the
government
but
by
the
force
of
circumstances.
he
is
not
compelled
to
testify.
if
he
does
not
testify
nothing
can
be
used
against
him.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
chooses
to
testify
in
open
court
under
the
advice
of
counsel
then
the
evidence
so
produced
is
available
as
testimony
in
open
court
under
the
advice
of
counsel
ordinarily
is.
but
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
stronger
reason
for
accepting
the
evidence
which
is
that
the
claim
under
the
fourth
amendment
was
wholly
without
basis.
here,
the
search
was
of
premises
in
which
the
defendant
had
no
interest
whatever.
he
never
claimed
that
he
had
any
interest
in
the
premises
and
the
evidence
of
the
owner
of
the
premises
is
unequivocal
that
he
did
not.
this
appears
twice
in
the
record
on
page
21
and
on
page
61.
moreover,
the
search
was
consented
to
by
the
owner
of
the
premises.
this
was
the
testimony
of
the
fbi
agent
which
the
court
accepted
in
ruling
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
mrs.
mahon
“led
the
search”,
he
testified.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
garrett
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i've
suppose
that
would
come
within
the
jones
case.
if
he
--
if
they
were
there
with
her
permission,
he
was
a
licensee
and
under
the
jones
case
he
had
a
standing
with
respect
to
the
premises.
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there's
no
evidence
here
that
the
police
did
know
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
she
gives
permission
for
them
to
be
taken,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
the
suitcases
found
on
the
public
highway,
i
suppose
it
can
be
taken
without
a
search
warrant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it's
been
abandoned
then
it
might
well
be
regarded
that
the
suitcase
under
all
the
circumstances
had
been
abandoned.
it
seemed
very
unlikely
that
the
defendant
was
going
to
come
back
and
claim
it
in
the
immediate
future
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
lived
there
or
that
he
had
any
relationship
whatever
with
the
premises.
in
the
jones
case,
the
court
said
that
the
rule
of
standing
there
developed
“would
of
course
not
avail
those
who
by
virtue
of
their
wrongful
presence
cannot
invoke
the
privacy
of
the
premises
searched”.
and
just
last
term
in
warden
against
hayden,
this
court
said
that
“we
have
recognized
that
the
principal
object
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
protection
of
privacy
rather
than
of
property.”
here,
the
defendant
never
had
any
claimed
privacy
whatever
in
the
premises
involved.
he
left
his
property
without
any
authority
and
the
person
who
had
authority
over
the
premises
relinquished
it
without
any
claim
of
violation
of
the
premises.
by
relinquishing
control
over
the
suitcase,
garrett
surrendered
whatever
right
to
privacy
he
may
have
had
as
to
the
contents
or
at
least
subjected
it
to
the
actions
of
the
person
who
did
have
the
right
to
privacy
as
to
the
premises.
now,
as
i
thought
about
this
problem
which
is
not
an
easy
one,
i've
tried
to
find
the
way
to
test
it.
the
issue
is,
i
suppose,
whether
there
should
be
a
general
rule
that
testimony
given
by
a
defendant
on
a
motion
to
suppress
is
never
admissible
against
him
at
his
trial.
there
is
a
certain
appeal
for
that,
perhaps,
though
it
goes
far
beyond
anything
that
can
be
found
in
the
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
grants
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
you
will
recall
or
read
simply
nor
can
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
there's
nothing
there
that
says
that
evidence
which
was
not
compelled
cannot
be
used
just
because
the
defendant
deliberately
chose
to
give
it
for
his
own
advantage.
let
us
suppose
that
at
the
motion
to
suppress
the
defendant,
a
hypothetical
defendant
not
this
defendant
here.
the
defendant
testified
that
the
clothes
were
his
then
at
the
trial
he
chooses
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
and
he
testified
that
the
clothes
are
not
his.
in
such
a
case,
could
it
be
supposed
that
his
prior
inconsistent
testiony
could
not
be
used
to
impeach
his
testimony
at
the
trial?
but
if
it
can
be
so
used
would
not
that
be
using
his
prior
testimony
against
him?
and
if
it
could
be
used
there,
then
there
is
no
rule
against
using
testimony
on
a
motion
to
suppress
and
why
should
not
the
testimony
be
used
here
since
it
was
freely
given
in
open
court
under
the
advice
of
counsel?
if
this
question
is
to
be
decided,
it
should
be
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
is
really
caught
in
a
dilemma
not
in
one
where
his
claim
is
wholly
unsupported
even
on
his
own
testimony
as
is
the
case
here.
certainly,
the
ordinary
rule
is
the
testimony
given
under
--
without
compulsion
in
open
court
under
the
advice
of
counsel
is
to
be
regarded
as
responsibly
given
and
to
be
taken
seriously.
here,
the
claim
under
the
fourth
amendment
was
essentially
frivolous
and
the
question
of
putting
the
defendant
to
a
dilemma
between
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment
should
be
left
to
a
case
where
that
dilemma
is
really
presented
on
facts
which
give
it
substance.
garrett
could
not
succeed
on
a
motion
to
suppress
unless
his
privilege
had
been
invaded.
he
had
to
show
some
relationship
to
the
place
where
the
seizure
was
made.
he
was
never
able
to
show
this.
without
it,
the
fact
that
he
owned
the
suitcase
or
its
contents
never
became
material.
he
was
never
in
a
situation
or
the
giving
of
the
testimony
that
he
owned
the
contents
of
the
suitcase
would
entitle
him
to
have
the
evidence
suppressed.
i
am
puzzled
as
to
why
he
wanted
to
testify.
the
clear
fact
that
seems
to
me
here
is
that
if
garrett
had
not
testified
this
evidence
could
not
have
been
used.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
two
suitcases
were
seized
by
the
government
at
that
time
exhibit
three
and
exhibit
four.
garrett's
testimony
related
only
to
exhibit
four
and
exhibit
three
was
never
introduced
into
evidence.
there
was
nothing
to
connect
this
suitcase
with
garrett
except
his
own
testimony
and
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
he
was
put
to
any
dilemma.
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
sit
back
and
object
to
the
relevancy
of
the
evidence
if
as
and
when
the
government
somehow
or
rather
sought
to
introduce
it.
if
garrett
had
simply
refrained
from
giving
his
testimony,
the
evidence
couldn't
have
been
used
against
him.
therefore
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
there
is
nothing
to
connect
it
with
garrett
or
anyone
else.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
contents
were
clothes
and
some
money
wrappers,
i
believe.
the
contents
were
clearly
related
to
the
robbery.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
they
were
not
connected
with
any
of
the
defendant
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
any
of
the
defendants
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
they
could
under
the
facts
which
were
no
longer
them
at
the
time
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
whether
this
comes
within
a
hot
pursuit
situation
like
that
in
warden
against
hayden.
here,
it
wasn't
quite
so
hot
except
that
they
had
just
found
the
thunderbird
automobile.
they
knew
whose
it
was
and
they
went
immediately
to
that
house.
and
it
might
be
that
within
warden
against
hayden
this
would
be
within
that
scope.
the
fact
that
this
material
was
evidentiary
would
no
longer
precluded
from
being
seized
and
i
think
if
we
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
warden
against
hayden
might
have
been
enough
to
show
that
there
were
the
extraordinary
circumstances
here.
garrett
was
in
fact
under
no
compulsion
to
give
the
testimony.
he
chose
to
give
it
and
did
so
in
open
court
under
the
advice
of
counsel.
we
submit
that
the
evidence
he
so
gave
was
properly
used
at
this
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
testimony
that
he
owned
the
contents
of
the
suitcase
was
not
relevant
as
i
see
it
to
his
fourth
amendment
point.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
as
the
court
said
last
term
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
suppose
that
--
that
in
so
far
as
the
evidence
he
gave
at
the
suppression
hearing
was
relevant
to
the
question
of
suppression
that
it
would
not
be
admissible
at
the
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
then
there
would
be
a
heavy
barrier
against
the
making
of
the
claim
under
the
fourth
amendment.
perhaps,
i'm
wrong
on
that.
perhaps,
i've
conceded
too
much.
i
think
that
the
--
the
cases
to
which
i
referred
in
the
lower
courts
generally
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
--
it
would
be
admissible
in
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
don't
have
a
question
put
by
mr.
justice
fortas
because
the
evidence
given
at
the
motion
to
suppress
is
irrelevant
to
the
motion
to
suppress.
it
showed
neither
by
his
evidence
nor
by
any
other
evidence
that
he
had
any
valid
standing
with
respect
to
the
premises,
and
as
this
court
has
said
it
is
privacy
and
not
property
which
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
i
was
wrong
in
saying
that.
certainly,
the
fact
that
the
evidence
can
be
used
as
exactly
what
judge
learned
hand
decided
in
the
case
to
which
reference
is
made
in
the
jones
case,
sentenced
--
quoted
in
the
jones
case.
the
petitioner
is
bar
shrank
from
that
predicament
but
they
were
obliged
to
choose
one
horn
of
the
dilemma
would
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
evidence
if
given
would
be
admissible
at
their
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
the
position
and
that
is
the
view
which
has
been
taken
by
a
considerable
number
of
lower
federal
courts.
