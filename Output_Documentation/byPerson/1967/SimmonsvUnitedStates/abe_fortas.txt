justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
not
suggesting
that
we
can
act
on
the
basis
of
assuming
that
those
were
the
facts,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
we
don't
know
how
many
other
pictures
if
any
were
shown.
justice
abe
fortas
but
we
don't
know.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
mr.
solicitor
general,
suppose
--
suppose
he
had
a
valid
fourth
amendment
point
and
suppose
the
court
sustained
it,
would
the
statement
that
he
made
at
the
suppression
hearing
be
usable
before
the
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i'm
really
trying
to
get
at
a
little
different
point.
let
me
--
let
us
suppose
that
he
testified
at
a
hearing
before
the
judge
without
the
jury
for
the
purpose
of
securing
suppression
of
a
particular
piece
of
evidence
and
the
judge
ruled
that
the
--
that
he
was
right
and
that
the
evidence
could
not
be
introduced
then,
however,
the
prosecutor
offers
his
statement
made
at
the
suppression
hearing
in
the
criminal
prosecution
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
is
that
alright
in
your
opinion
or
there's
a
violation
of
his
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
there
are
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
government
had
used
photographs
of
the
defendant
which
were
doctored
and
then
an
appropriate
demand
were
made
to
compel
the
government
to
produce
those
photographs,
would
that
involve
a
constitutional
principle?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
is
not
in
this
case
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
