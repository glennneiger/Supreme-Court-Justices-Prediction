mr.
raymond
j.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
--
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioners,
garrett
and
simmons
and
a
defendant
andrews
were
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
on
the
charges
of
bank
robbery
with
a
dangerous
weapon.
all
three
men
were
sentenced
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
for
a
period
of
three
--
of
10
years.
now,
on
appeal,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
decision
in
andrews
on
the
ground
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
first
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner,
simmons
here
is
that
his
pre-trial
identifications
were
so
unnecessarily
suggestive
and
conducive
to
irreparable
mistaken
identity
that
he
was
deprived
of
due
process
of
law.
on
february
27th,
1964,
two
men
robbed
the
ben
franklin
savings
and
loan
association
in
chicago.
the
two
men
were
in
the
bank
about
five
minutes.
this
occurred
about
1:45
pm.
the
two
men
fled
and
took
$1500
with
them.
a
mr.
misaika,
who
was
one
of
the
bank
tellers
left
the
bank
and
followed
the
two
men
and
saw
them
drive
away
in
a
white
1960
thunderbird.
this
car
had
a
scrape,
a
large
scrape
along
the
door
on
the
passenger's
side.
as
soon
as
the
police
arrived,
they
made
a
general
search
of
the
area
to
find
this
car
described
by
mr.
misaika.
at
2:30
pm,
this
search
led
to
a
white
thunderbird
owned
by
mary
ruth
rey
who
was
a
sister
of
the
defendant,
andrews
and
the
sister-in-law
of
the
petitioner,
simmons.
at
3
o'clock,
six
men
entered
the
home
of
the
mother
of
andrews,
searched
but
didn't
take
anything.
at
five
o'clock
that
same
day,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
entered
andrews'
mother's
home
looking
for
andrews
and
simmons.
they
did
not
find
them
but
they
did
find
two
suitcases.
one
of
which
contained
some
bank
money
wrappers
and
other
incriminating
evidence.
the
next
day,
the
fbi
went
to
the
home
of
simmons'
--
another
of
simmons'
sister-in-law
and
another
sister
of
the
defendant
andrews
and
obtained
four
or
five
pictures
of
simmons
and
andrews.
now,
it
is
clear
then,
that
same
day
they
took
these
pictures
to
be
viewed
by
the
members
of
the
bank
that
had
witnessed
the
robbery.
it
is
clear
then
that
at
the
time
that
these
pictures
were
shown
to
the
witnesses,
the
fbi
had
two
definite
suspects
in
mind,
simmons
and
andrews.
it
is
also
clear
that
the
witnesses
were
aware
that
the
fbi
was
close
to
a
solution
of
the
identity
of
the
bank
robbers
because
mr.
misaika
had
seen
this
white
thunderbird.
he
had
also
seen
that
car
later
in
the
day
in
the
custody
of
the
fbi.
so
he
knew
that
the
car
used
in
the
bank
robbery
had
been
taken
into
custody.
and
he
had
talked
over
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
bank
robbery
with
the
other
members
of
the
bank,
the
tellers
who
were
to
be
the
witnesses.
a
mrs.parlimen
also
said
that
she
was
aware
that
the
1960
white
thunderbird
had
been
used
by
the
bank
robbers
and
she
hadn't
talked
to
mr.
misaika
but
had
talked
to
some
of
the
other
bank
tellers
so
that
it
was
common
knowledge
among
the
tellers
that
the
police
were
close
to
apprehending
the
bank
robbers.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
number
one,
the
fbi
having
two
definite
suspects
in
mind
and
number
two,
the
bank
teller
witnesses
being
aware
that
the
fbi
was
in
hot
pursuit
of
the
bank
robbers,
these
pictures
were
shown
the
very
next
day
after
the
robbery
to
the
tellers.
now,
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
showing
of
the
pictures.
the
first
one
is
that
the
use
of
multiple
pictures
of
the
petitioner,
simmons
and
the
second
was
the
limitation
of
other
people
depicted
in
the
photographs.
now,
on
the
first
point,
all
of
the
five
witnesses
agree
that
more
than
one
picture
of
simmons
was
shown
to
the
bank
tellers.
most
of
the
witnesses
said
that
there
were
three
or
four.
mrs.
parlamen
specifically
remembering
three
and
saying
that
there
could
have
been
four
and
that
was
the
consensus
of
what
the
witnesses
said.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
they
were
snapshots,
your
honor
taken
from
the
sister
and
sister-in-law
of
these
two
men.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes
they
did,
your
honor
but
as
i
will
try
to
point
out
because
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
because
of
what
all
the
other
witnesses
said,
i
think
she
was
mistaken
in
what
she
had
said.
now,
the
fbi
was
not
content
with
this
initial
showing
of
these
pictures
and
they
made
--
there
were
various
other
showings
of
the
pictures.
in
fact,
right
until
the
day
before
the
trial.
and
once
again,
on
each
and
every
occasion,
more
than
one
picture
of
simmons
were
shown
and
on
most
occasions,
a
number
of
three
or
four
were
shown.
now
all
the
witnesses
said
this.
now,
the
government
in
its
answer,
in
no
way
tries
to
justify
this
aspect
of
the
showing
of
the
pictures,
the
multiple
use
of
these
pictures
because
there
really
is
no
justification
for
it.
now,
what
were
these
witnesses
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
it
violated
due
process,
your
honor,
because
the
police
authority
in
this
case
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
was
focusing
the
attention
of
these
witnesses
on
a
particular
suspect
in
this
case
of
simmons.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
not
because
they
let
them
see
the
pictures
because
they
--
well,
yes
they
let
them
see
the
pictures
and
they
used
more
than
one
of
them.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
under
the
circumstances
of
a
proper
lineup,
it
would
not
have
been
a
violation
of
due
process,
your
honor.
but,
what
were
these
witnesses
to
think
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
both
your
honor.
my
primary
argument
is
on
constitutional
grounds
but
i'm
also
saying
that
since
it
is
a
federal
case
with
federal
law
enforcement
officers
that
it
could
also
be
reversed
based
on
supervisory
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
it
did,
your
honor
but
i
rely
on
some
of
the
reasoning
used
not
on
the
principle
of
not
having
an
attorney
there.
i
am
not
relying
on
that
but
some
of
the
court's
reasoning
in
the
difficulties
incurred
and
the
possibilities
of
a
suggestion
at
a
pretrial
lineup
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
it
is,
your
honor
in
stovall.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
well,
your
honor
as
far
as
the
supervisory
powers
are
concerned,
i'm
relying
on
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
which
the
court
from
time
to
time
when
violations
of
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
law
of
the
land
have
occurred
in
federal
cases
that
the
courts
have
held
that
the
supervisory
powers
could
be
used
by
the
courts
to
establish
the
rules
of
evidence
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
well,
in
certain
cases,
it
was
the
fourth
amendment,
your
honor.
i
know
that
your
honor
feels
that
there
must
be
a
particular
amendment
involved
and
not
just
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
due
process
situation.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not
have
that
in
mind.
now,
as
far
as
this
use
of
all
the
pictures
of
simmons,
what
could
the
witnesses
think
except
for
the
fact
that
at
least,
the
fbi
must
have
thought
that
simmons
had
committed
the
bank
robbery.
and
they
also
must
have
thought
because
of
the
circumstances
of
the
investigation
that
the
investigation
of
the
fbi
led
them
to
think
that.
now,
there
isn't
anything
comparable
to
this
in
a
lineup
situation,
it's
really
more
of
a
show
up
but
the
closest
thing
that
could
be
compared
to
it
would
be
a
situation
in
which
the
fbi
would
say
“now,
mr.
witness,
i'm
going
to
show
you
three
lineups
here
and
wait
for
your
decision
until
the
end
of
the
three
lineups.”
they
would
then
put
simmons
with
a,
take
a
away
and
put
simmons
with
b,
take
b
away
and
put
simmons
with
c.
well,
naturally,
after
simmons
being
in
all
three
of
these
so
called
lineups,
the
witness
is
going
to
get
the
idea
that
the
fbi
or
the
police
force
inviled
things
that
simmons
didn't.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
your
honor,
once
a
--
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
wade,
once
the
witness,
first
of
all,
makes
this
identification,
it's
very
difficult,
if
--
almost
impossible
to
ever
go
back
on
that
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
right,
but
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
your
honor.
i
think
under
these
circumstances
cross-examination
and
credibility
and
weight
is
not
a
sufficient
test
and
i
would
rely
on
stovall
versus
denno
there
that
certainly
the
defendant
and
in
that
case
had
adequate
cross-examination
and
question
of
weight
and
yet
this
court
felt
that
it
could
be
considered
a
violation
of
due
process
under
the
proper
circumstances.
once
that
witness
takes
this
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes
--
no.
you
did,
your
honor
but
you
said
because
of
the
particular
circumstances
in
that
case,
i
believe
you
said
that
it
could
be
a
violation
of
due
process
because
of
--
but
because
of
the
urgency
there
and
the
necessity
to
bring
that
particular
witness
before
the
--
what
could
have
been
a
dying
victim
there
that
you
would
not
reverse
the
case
and
affirm
that
case.
now,
the
second
aspect
of
this
showing
of
the
pictures,
were
that
the
limitation
of
the
other
persons
depicted
in
the
photographs.
now,
all
the
witnesses,
except
one
who
testified
as
to
the
number
of
the
pictures
said
that
there
were
five
or
six.
now,
remembering
that
the
fbi
had
obtained
four
or
five
pictures
from
andrews'
sister,
it
is
logical
to
conclude
that
those
were
the
four
or
five
pictures
shown
to
the
witnesses.
we
also
have
mrs.
parlamen's
testimony
that
two
of
them
were
of
andrews.
well,
with
the
two
of
andrews
and
the
three
or
four
of
simmons.
it
shows
that
likely,
all
of
the
pictures
were
of
either
andrews
or
simmons
in
this
case.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
too
that
after
all
these
cross-examinations
about
how
many
pictures
had
been
used,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
agent
who
investigated
the
case
never
took
the
stand
to
say,
“oh!
no,
there
were
more
than
five
or
six
pictures.
we
used
10
or
12
or
whatever
it
was.”
no
such
testimony
was
forthcoming.
so
i
think
--
it
is
logical
to
conclude
especially
from
the
fact
that
they
obtained
these
pictures
from
the
sister
and
on
the
same
day
bring
them
to
the
bank.
and
they
showed
what
most
witnesses
say
five
or
six
pictures.
so,
it's
logical
that
these
were
the
pictures
they
got
from
the
sister,
brought
it
over
the
bank
and
showed
it
to
them.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
your
honor.
the
primary
reliance
of
the
petitioner,
simmons
on
this
situation
is
the
use
of
the
multiple
pictures
because
there
is
no
question
about
that
but
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
we
don't
know
for
a
certain,
your
honor,
because
my
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
that's
right,
your
honor.
one
witness
as
was
pointed
out
did
say
that
there
were
--
could
have
been
50.
but
as
i
have
tried
to
point
out
that
i
believe
that
because
of
what
the
other
witnesses
said
and
the
circumstances
of
bringing
them
right
from
the
bank
that
it's
likely
that
five
or
six
were
used
and
that
they
were
all
of
simmons
or
andrews.
now,
some
witnesses
said
that
in
the
follow-up
interviews
when
they
showed
the
pictures,
the
number
of
pictures
increased.
and
still,
we
have
occasions
where
as
mrs.
parlamen
said
that
the
day
she
was
subpoenaed,
she
was
shown
seven
pictures.
four
of
them
were
of
the
petitioner,
simmons
and
three
of
them
were
now
of
the
petitioner
garrett.
also,
a
witness
who
testified
that
she
saw
the
pictures
the
day
before
the
trial
said
that
there
were
four
pictures
and
two
of
them
were
of
simmons.
now,
the
last
phase
of
this
is
that
at
the
day
of
the
trial,
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
before
the
jury
was
picked,
three
or
four
witnesses
in
the
accompaniment
of
the
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
were
on
the
back
of
the
courtroom.
the
only
ones
who
were
in
the
courtroom
were
the
defendants
and
they
saw
the
petitioner,
simmons
at
that
time.
now,
as
far
as
the
initial
showing,
there
are
three
other
factors
that
show
the
possibility
of
suggestion
here.
the
first
is
that
the
witnesses
all
viewed
the
pictures
in
the
bank
in
the
same
room
as
mr.
misaika
said
in
the
front
part
of
the
bank.
now,
it
is
true
that
they
did
not
all
huddle
around
and
identified
the
pictures
together
but
they
were
called
up
separately
but
mr.
misaika
did
testify
that
at
the
time
he
identified
the
pictures
in
the
bank,
the
two
other
tellers
were
right
near
him
towards
the
front
of
the
bank.
so
the
possibility
of
--
especially
if
a
small
number
of
pictures
are
shown
that
the
other
two
who
have
identified
it,
well,
these
must
be
the
men.
now,
there
are
also
indications
that
the
various
bank
tellers
talked
over
the
facts
of
the
case
to
such
an
extent
that
mr.
misaika,
for
instance,
admitted
that
he
told
the
fbi
things
that
he
actually
hadn't
seen.
what
a
certain
man
did,
what
garrett
was
supposed
to
have
done,
he
testified
to
that.
i
mean,
he
made
a
statement
to
that
but
actually
he
hadn't
seen
it.
and
the
third
thing
is,
and
last,
is
that
though
it
is
correct
as
the
government
has
indicated
that
mr.
misaika
did
testify
that
simmons
had
a
southern
accent
on
direct
examination.
in
cross-examination,
he
--
it
was
brought
out
that
in
his
statement
to
the
fbi,
he
said
that
simmons
had
a
tennessee
accent.
when
he
was
interrogated
as
to
how
he
knew
that
it
was
a
tennessee
accent,
he
said,
“well,
i
spent
a
couple
of
years
in
alabama
and
south
carolina
and
the
people
from
tennessee
speak
faster.”
and
this
is
about
the
only
basis
that
he
had
for
it.
now,
it
should
be
noted
that
at
the
time
he
made
this
statement,
the
fbi
knew
that
simmons
was
living
in
pulaski,
tennessee.
so,
under
all
these
circumstances,
the
possibility
and
the
likelihood
of
suggestion
in
this
case
with
the
use
of
the
multiple
photographs
particularly
of
simmons
and
also
the
limitation
of
the
number
of
people
in
the
lineup.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
that
is
garrett
your
honor.
yes,
i
am.
the
government's
argument
is
that
it
--
they
really
don't
really
contest
this
business
about
the
use
of
the
multiple
photographs.
they
really
say,
“well,
andrews
was
our
prime
suspect
too
and
he
wasn't
identified?”
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
first
of
all,
the
number
of
pictures
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
it
doesn't
concede
that
but
it
concedes
the
factual
situation
involved
of
the
use
--
the
multiple
use
of
the
pictures
your
honor
and
it
really
doesn't
answer
this
in
any
way
or
try
to
justify
it.
all
it
says
is
that
well,
andrews
was
a
prime
suspect
and
he
wasn't
identified.
however,
he
might
have
been
a
prime
suspect
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
but
--
simmons
was
the
one
that
they
used
the
three
or
four
pictures
on
and
he
was
the
one
that
they
focused
on
at
the
time
of
the
critical
time
of
the
identification.
now,
all
these
means
is
that
there
were
two
men
in
the
bank.
one
was
small
and
dark
and
the
other
was
tall
and
lean
and
that
the
witnesses
considering
the
four
pictures
of
simmons
involved
thought
that
simmons
resembled
the
man,
the
tall,
thin
man
more
than
andrews.
however,
they
did
look
alike
enough
so
that
one
witness
identified
andrews
in
the
courtroom
and
then
later
changed
her
testimony
to
the
fact
that
it
was
simmons.
now,
all
other
witnesses
in
the
case
actually
tie
up
simmons
--
andrews
much
more
to
the
case
than
tie
andrews
up
to
the
case
much
more
than
simmons.
it
was
simmons
--
andrews
who
picked
up
the
car
before
and
after
and
delivered
it.
it
was
andrews
who
was
seen
with
garrett
before
the
bank
robbery
and
was
seen
coming
with
him
after
the
bank
robbery
and
not
simmons.
so
the
real
possibility
exists
that
because
of
this
focusing
on
simmons,
the
wrong
man
might
have
been
identified
and
that
it
could
actually
have
been
andrews
involved
in
the
bank
robbery.
the
last
part
of
the
argument
on
this
point
by
the
government
is
that
they
mentioned
certain
commentators
who
have
said
that
evils
--
have
listed
12
evils
that
exist
in
pretrial
identification
and
that
out
of
these
12
only
one
exists
in
the
simmons
case.
well,
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
same
one
the
short
period
of
time
that
the
witness
sees
the
accused
during
the
crime
is
the
only
one
present
in
stovall
versus
denno
too.
so,
the
commentators
apparently
did
not
conceive
that
the
fbi
situation
here
were
to
use
some
multiple
ictures.
now,
the
second
point
is
that
--
i
will
go
on
to
the
third
point,
your
honor
in
answer
to
your
question
then.
we
have
here
the
issue
presented
by
the
petitioner
garrett
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
allowing
his
statement
in
support
of
his
motion
to
suppress
to
be
used
by
the
government
in
its
case
in
chief
to
prove
ownership
of
certain
damaging
evidence
that
was
seized
from
the
home
of
andrews'
mother.
now,
the
government
was
going
to
introduce
this
evidence,
these
money
wrappers
from
the
bank
and
other
incriminating
evidence,
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
petitioner,
garrett
made
a
motion
to
suppress
this
evidence
and
in
support
thereof
testified
that
the
suitcase
and
the
contents
of
that
suitcase
were
his.
over
the
objection
of
both
simmons
and
garrett,
the
government
was
allowed
to
introduce
into
evidence
the
testimony
of
garrett
in
support
of
his
motion
to
suppress.
now,
the
cases
--
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
garrett
here
that
he
was
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma,
he
was
forced
to
sacrifice
under
the
court's
ruling
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
in
order
to
enforce
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
the
government's
cited
cases
and
the
reasoning
of
the
government
and
the
cases
that
they
have
cited
is
basically
this,
and
here
is
i
think
the
most
important
factor
here
--
is
that
just
like
any
--
this
is
a
situation
just
like
any
other
trial.
a
defendant
doesn't
have
to
take
the
stand
and
if
he
does
take
the
stand,
he
is
responsible
for
his
acts
and
they
can
be
later
used
against
him.
well,
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
situation
that
should
be
applied
in
a
motion
to
suppress
because
in
the
trial
of
an
ordinary
case,
the
defendant
has
absolutely
no
burden.
he
has
the
presumption
of
innocence.
the
government
must
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
defendant
need
to
present
no
evidence,
it
can
just
rely
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
of
the
government.
but
this
is
not
the
case
on
a
motion
to
suppress.
he
has
the
burden
of
proof.
the
defendant
does.
he
must
show
that
this
evidence
was
obtained
improperly.
and
therefore,
and
under
those
circumstances,
he
really
is,
unlike
a
trial
of
the
ordinary
case,
really
is
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma.
and
it
shouldn't
be
a
gamble
situation
in
the
united
states
district
court
that
if
we
are
successful
then
we
can
have
this
--
they
can
never
use
our
statement
against
us.
it
should
be
that
he
--
this
statement
that
he
makes
in
support
of
his
motion
to
suppress
cannot
be
used
against
him
whether
his
motion
to
suppress
is
successful
or
not.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
well,
your
honor,
here
is
a
factual
situation
there.
simmons
did
object
to
this
--
to
the
use
of
this
testimony.
however,
the
trial
court
did
not
allow
this
incriminating
evidence
in
against
simmons.
the
only
evidence
that
--
the
only
person
that
it
was
allowed
in
against
was
the
petitioner,
garrett.
however,
once
that
evidence
got
in,
it
was
so
damaging
that
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
for
the
jury
to
erase
from
its
mind
the
fact
of
the
bank
money
wrappers
and
that
coupled
with
this
identification
of
the
people
in
the
bank
made
it
impossible
for
simmons
to
get
a
fair
trial.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
not
at
all.
not
at
all
your
honor
and
none
of
that
evidence
was
introduced
against
simmons.
however,
my
only
point
is
that
once
it
got
in,
there
had
been
a
connection
shown
between
simmons
and
garrett
through
other
testimony
and
once
it
gets
in
that
garrett
has
this
incriminating
evidence
in
his
possession
in
the
house
of
the
mother-in-law
of
simmons
then
the
jury
was
unable
to
find
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
the
admissibility
of
the
statement
of
garrett,
yes.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
i
do
not
your
honor.
you
mean
as
far
as
whether
or
not
the
motion
to
suppress
should
have
been
granted
or
not.
no,
i
do
not.
at
this
stage,
your
honor.
i
do
not
challenge
that.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
well,
based
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
were
sufficient
grounds
and
that
they
held
that
there
was
consent
on
the
part
of
the
mother
to
search
the
house.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they
could
have
had
--
had
he
not
taken
the
witness
stand
but
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
well,
he
didn't
know
what
government
had
to
begin
with.
and
secondly,
your
honor
wouldn't
that
be
a
terrible
situation
if
the
government
introduced
its
evidence
and
really
didn't
tied
in
with
any
one
particular
man?
it
might
have
been
that
the
jury
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
andrews'
suitcase
and
here
is
a
man
whose
case
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
he
might
have
been
convicted
on
the
basis
of
the
suitcase
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
received
in
evidence.
i
think
it
would
have
because
it
had
been
found
in
the
house
of
the
mother
of
andrews.
yes,
i
do.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
that
anything
he
says
unless
they
had
a
statement
to
that
effect
given
on
another
occasion
but
anything
that
he
for
the
first
time
says
on
his
motion
to
suppress
should
be
unavailable
in
the
government's
case
in
chief.
and
the
last
point
i
wish
to
mention
was
that
the
photograph
should
have
been
producible
under
section
3500,
two
witnesses
at
least
said
that
they
had
spoken
with
the
fbi
concerning
those
statements
and
therefore
any
statement
that
was
given
would
be
--
wouldn't
make
any
sense
unless
you
had
the
photographs.
if
a
witness
says,
“that's
the
man
that
robbed
the
bank”
to
the
fbi
and
there's
a
photograph
of
them,
without
that
photograph,
there
can't
be
adequate
cross-examination.
and
i
think
that
it
--
since
it
is
part
of
the
statement
in
a
way
that
it
should
be
producible
under
section
3500
especially
in
this
case
of
all
others
where
it
was
so
critical
of
issue
of
identification
of
the
bank
robbers.
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
your
honor
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
only
in
the
sense
that
on
the
motion
for
judgment
of
the
court
to
let
the
close
of
all
the
evidence
if
this
motion
was
--
if
this
evidence
was
obtained
in
violation
of
the
due
process
then
there
would
be
no
other
evidence
left
but
per
se,
it
was
not
raised
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
it
was
not
argued
as
far
as
this
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
it's
certainly
was,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes
it
did.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
that
speaks
specifically
of
the
due
process
question,
your
honor.
but
it
definitely
was
raised
in
the
brief
and
they
just
kind
of
went
to
the
question
of
whether
the
real
thing
here
they
said
was
there
was
enough
cross-examination
and
it
goes
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
that's
all
they
considered
about
the
pictures.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes
it
was.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor
i
think
it
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
the
jencks?
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
i
would
not
say
that
that
would
be
a
constitutional
question.
no
i
would
not.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no
i
do
not,
you
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
i
think
there
are
two
questions,
your
honor.
one
of
the
photographs
are
producible,
and
two,
whether
the
due
process
question
comes
up
in
the
use
of
the
photographs
by
the
fbi
in
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
definitely,
your
honor.
completely
independent.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
none,
just
the
jencks
act.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor
then
there
would
be
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
--
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioners,
garrett
and
simmons
and
a
defendant
andrews
were
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
on
the
charges
of
bank
robbery
with
a
dangerous
weapon.
all
three
men
were
sentenced
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
for
a
period
of
three
--
of
10
years.
now,
on
appeal,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
decision
in
andrews
on
the
ground
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
first
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner,
simmons
here
is
that
his
pre-trial
identifications
were
so
unnecessarily
suggestive
and
conducive
to
irreparable
mistaken
identity
that
he
was
deprived
of
due
process
of
law.
on
february
27th,
1964,
two
men
robbed
the
ben
franklin
savings
and
loan
association
in
chicago.
the
two
men
were
in
the
bank
about
five
minutes.
this
occurred
about
1:45
pm.
the
two
men
fled
and
took
$1500
with
them.
a
mr.
misaika,
who
was
one
of
the
bank
tellers
left
the
bank
and
followed
the
two
men
and
saw
them
drive
away
in
a
white
1960
thunderbird.
this
car
had
a
scrape,
a
large
scrape
along
the
door
on
the
passenger's
side.
as
soon
as
the
police
arrived,
they
made
a
general
search
of
the
area
to
find
this
car
described
by
mr.
misaika.
at
2:30
pm,
this
search
led
to
a
white
thunderbird
owned
by
mary
ruth
rey
who
was
a
sister
of
the
defendant,
andrews
and
the
sister-in-law
of
the
petitioner,
simmons.
at
3
o'clock,
six
men
entered
the
home
of
the
mother
of
andrews,
searched
but
didn't
take
anything.
at
five
o'clock
that
same
day,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
entered
andrews'
mother's
home
looking
for
andrews
and
simmons.
they
did
not
find
them
but
they
did
find
two
suitcases.
one
of
which
contained
some
bank
money
wrappers
and
other
incriminating
evidence.
the
next
day,
the
fbi
went
to
the
home
of
simmons'
--
another
of
simmons'
sister-in-law
and
another
sister
of
the
defendant
andrews
and
obtained
four
or
five
pictures
of
simmons
and
andrews.
now,
it
is
clear
then,
that
same
day
they
took
these
pictures
to
be
viewed
by
the
members
of
the
bank
that
had
witnessed
the
robbery.
it
is
clear
then
that
at
the
time
that
these
pictures
were
shown
to
the
witnesses,
the
fbi
had
two
definite
suspects
in
mind,
simmons
and
andrews.
it
is
also
clear
that
the
witnesses
were
aware
that
the
fbi
was
close
to
a
solution
of
the
identity
of
the
bank
robbers
because
mr.
misaika
had
seen
this
white
thunderbird.
he
had
also
seen
that
car
later
in
the
day
in
the
custody
of
the
fbi.
so
he
knew
that
the
car
used
in
the
bank
robbery
had
been
taken
into
custody.
and
he
had
talked
over
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
bank
robbery
with
the
other
members
of
the
bank,
the
tellers
who
were
to
be
the
witnesses.
a
mrs.parlimen
also
said
that
she
was
aware
that
the
1960
white
thunderbird
had
been
used
by
the
bank
robbers
and
she
hadn't
talked
to
mr.
misaika
but
had
talked
to
some
of
the
other
bank
tellers
so
that
it
was
common
knowledge
among
the
tellers
that
the
police
were
close
to
apprehending
the
bank
robbers.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
number
one,
the
fbi
having
two
definite
suspects
in
mind
and
number
two,
the
bank
teller
witnesses
being
aware
that
the
fbi
was
in
hot
pursuit
of
the
bank
robbers,
these
pictures
were
shown
the
very
next
day
after
the
robbery
to
the
tellers.
now,
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
showing
of
the
pictures.
the
first
one
is
that
the
use
of
multiple
pictures
of
the
petitioner,
simmons
and
the
second
was
the
limitation
of
other
people
depicted
in
the
photographs.
now,
on
the
first
point,
all
of
the
five
witnesses
agree
that
more
than
one
picture
of
simmons
was
shown
to
the
bank
tellers.
most
of
the
witnesses
said
that
there
were
three
or
four.
mrs.
parlamen
specifically
remembering
three
and
saying
that
there
could
have
been
four
and
that
was
the
consensus
of
what
the
witnesses
said.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
they
were
snapshots,
your
honor
taken
from
the
sister
and
sister-in-law
of
these
two
men.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes
they
did,
your
honor
but
as
i
will
try
to
point
out
because
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
because
of
what
all
the
other
witnesses
said,
i
think
she
was
mistaken
in
what
she
had
said.
now,
the
fbi
was
not
content
with
this
initial
showing
of
these
pictures
and
they
made
--
there
were
various
other
showings
of
the
pictures.
in
fact,
right
until
the
day
before
the
trial.
and
once
again,
on
each
and
every
occasion,
more
than
one
picture
of
simmons
were
shown
and
on
most
occasions,
a
number
of
three
or
four
were
shown.
now
all
the
witnesses
said
this.
now,
the
government
in
its
answer,
in
no
way
tries
to
justify
this
aspect
of
the
showing
of
the
pictures,
the
multiple
use
of
these
pictures
because
there
really
is
no
justification
for
it.
now,
what
were
these
witnesses
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
it
violated
due
process,
your
honor,
because
the
police
authority
in
this
case
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
was
focusing
the
attention
of
these
witnesses
on
a
particular
suspect
in
this
case
of
simmons.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
not
because
they
let
them
see
the
pictures
because
they
--
well,
yes
they
let
them
see
the
pictures
and
they
used
more
than
one
of
them.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
under
the
circumstances
of
a
proper
lineup,
it
would
not
have
been
a
violation
of
due
process,
your
honor.
but,
what
were
these
witnesses
to
think
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
both
your
honor.
my
primary
argument
is
on
constitutional
grounds
but
i'm
also
saying
that
since
it
is
a
federal
case
with
federal
law
enforcement
officers
that
it
could
also
be
reversed
based
on
supervisory
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
it
did,
your
honor
but
i
rely
on
some
of
the
reasoning
used
not
on
the
principle
of
not
having
an
attorney
there.
i
am
not
relying
on
that
but
some
of
the
court's
reasoning
in
the
difficulties
incurred
and
the
possibilities
of
a
suggestion
at
a
pretrial
lineup
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
it
is,
your
honor
in
stovall.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
well,
your
honor
as
far
as
the
supervisory
powers
are
concerned,
i'm
relying
on
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
which
the
court
from
time
to
time
when
violations
of
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
law
of
the
land
have
occurred
in
federal
cases
that
the
courts
have
held
that
the
supervisory
powers
could
be
used
by
the
courts
to
establish
the
rules
of
evidence
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
well,
in
certain
cases,
it
was
the
fourth
amendment,
your
honor.
i
know
that
your
honor
feels
that
there
must
be
a
particular
amendment
involved
and
not
just
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
due
process
situation.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not
have
that
in
mind.
now,
as
far
as
this
use
of
all
the
pictures
of
simmons,
what
could
the
witnesses
think
except
for
the
fact
that
at
least,
the
fbi
must
have
thought
that
simmons
had
committed
the
bank
robbery.
and
they
also
must
have
thought
because
of
the
circumstances
of
the
investigation
that
the
investigation
of
the
fbi
led
them
to
think
that.
now,
there
isn't
anything
comparable
to
this
in
a
lineup
situation,
it's
really
more
of
a
show
up
but
the
closest
thing
that
could
be
compared
to
it
would
be
a
situation
in
which
the
fbi
would
say
“now,
mr.
witness,
i'm
going
to
show
you
three
lineups
here
and
wait
for
your
decision
until
the
end
of
the
three
lineups.”
they
would
then
put
simmons
with
a,
take
a
away
and
put
simmons
with
b,
take
b
away
and
put
simmons
with
c.
well,
naturally,
after
simmons
being
in
all
three
of
these
so
called
lineups,
the
witness
is
going
to
get
the
idea
that
the
fbi
or
the
police
force
inviled
things
that
simmons
didn't.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
your
honor,
once
a
--
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
wade,
once
the
witness,
first
of
all,
makes
this
identification,
it's
very
difficult,
if
--
almost
impossible
to
ever
go
back
on
that
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
right,
but
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
your
honor.
i
think
under
these
circumstances
cross-examination
and
credibility
and
weight
is
not
a
sufficient
test
and
i
would
rely
on
stovall
versus
denno
there
that
certainly
the
defendant
and
in
that
case
had
adequate
cross-examination
and
question
of
weight
and
yet
this
court
felt
that
it
could
be
considered
a
violation
of
due
process
under
the
proper
circumstances.
once
that
witness
takes
this
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes
--
no.
you
did,
your
honor
but
you
said
because
of
the
particular
circumstances
in
that
case,
i
believe
you
said
that
it
could
be
a
violation
of
due
process
because
of
--
but
because
of
the
urgency
there
and
the
necessity
to
bring
that
particular
witness
before
the
--
what
could
have
been
a
dying
victim
there
that
you
would
not
reverse
the
case
and
affirm
that
case.
now,
the
second
aspect
of
this
showing
of
the
pictures,
were
that
the
limitation
of
the
other
persons
depicted
in
the
photographs.
now,
all
the
witnesses,
except
one
who
testified
as
to
the
number
of
the
pictures
said
that
there
were
five
or
six.
now,
remembering
that
the
fbi
had
obtained
four
or
five
pictures
from
andrews'
sister,
it
is
logical
to
conclude
that
those
were
the
four
or
five
pictures
shown
to
the
witnesses.
we
also
have
mrs.
parlamen's
testimony
that
two
of
them
were
of
andrews.
well,
with
the
two
of
andrews
and
the
three
or
four
of
simmons.
it
shows
that
likely,
all
of
the
pictures
were
of
either
andrews
or
simmons
in
this
case.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
too
that
after
all
these
cross-examinations
about
how
many
pictures
had
been
used,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
agent
who
investigated
the
case
never
took
the
stand
to
say,
“oh!
no,
there
were
more
than
five
or
six
pictures.
we
used
10
or
12
or
whatever
it
was.”
no
such
testimony
was
forthcoming.
so
i
think
--
it
is
logical
to
conclude
especially
from
the
fact
that
they
obtained
these
pictures
from
the
sister
and
on
the
same
day
bring
them
to
the
bank.
and
they
showed
what
most
witnesses
say
five
or
six
pictures.
so,
it's
logical
that
these
were
the
pictures
they
got
from
the
sister,
brought
it
over
the
bank
and
showed
it
to
them.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
your
honor.
the
primary
reliance
of
the
petitioner,
simmons
on
this
situation
is
the
use
of
the
multiple
pictures
because
there
is
no
question
about
that
but
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
we
don't
know
for
a
certain,
your
honor,
because
my
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
that's
right,
your
honor.
one
witness
as
was
pointed
out
did
say
that
there
were
--
could
have
been
50.
but
as
i
have
tried
to
point
out
that
i
believe
that
because
of
what
the
other
witnesses
said
and
the
circumstances
of
bringing
them
right
from
the
bank
that
it's
likely
that
five
or
six
were
used
and
that
they
were
all
of
simmons
or
andrews.
now,
some
witnesses
said
that
in
the
follow-up
interviews
when
they
showed
the
pictures,
the
number
of
pictures
increased.
and
still,
we
have
occasions
where
as
mrs.
parlamen
said
that
the
day
she
was
subpoenaed,
she
was
shown
seven
pictures.
four
of
them
were
of
the
petitioner,
simmons
and
three
of
them
were
now
of
the
petitioner
garrett.
also,
a
witness
who
testified
that
she
saw
the
pictures
the
day
before
the
trial
said
that
there
were
four
pictures
and
two
of
them
were
of
simmons.
now,
the
last
phase
of
this
is
that
at
the
day
of
the
trial,
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
before
the
jury
was
picked,
three
or
four
witnesses
in
the
accompaniment
of
the
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
were
on
the
back
of
the
courtroom.
the
only
ones
who
were
in
the
courtroom
were
the
defendants
and
they
saw
the
petitioner,
simmons
at
that
time.
now,
as
far
as
the
initial
showing,
there
are
three
other
factors
that
show
the
possibility
of
suggestion
here.
the
first
is
that
the
witnesses
all
viewed
the
pictures
in
the
bank
in
the
same
room
as
mr.
misaika
said
in
the
front
part
of
the
bank.
now,
it
is
true
that
they
did
not
all
huddle
around
and
identified
the
pictures
together
but
they
were
called
up
separately
but
mr.
misaika
did
testify
that
at
the
time
he
identified
the
pictures
in
the
bank,
the
two
other
tellers
were
right
near
him
towards
the
front
of
the
bank.
so
the
possibility
of
--
especially
if
a
small
number
of
pictures
are
shown
that
the
other
two
who
have
identified
it,
well,
these
must
be
the
men.
now,
there
are
also
indications
that
the
various
bank
tellers
talked
over
the
facts
of
the
case
to
such
an
extent
that
mr.
misaika,
for
instance,
admitted
that
he
told
the
fbi
things
that
he
actually
hadn't
seen.
what
a
certain
man
did,
what
garrett
was
supposed
to
have
done,
he
testified
to
that.
i
mean,
he
made
a
statement
to
that
but
actually
he
hadn't
seen
it.
and
the
third
thing
is,
and
last,
is
that
though
it
is
correct
as
the
government
has
indicated
that
mr.
misaika
did
testify
that
simmons
had
a
southern
accent
on
direct
examination.
in
cross-examination,
he
--
it
was
brought
out
that
in
his
statement
to
the
fbi,
he
said
that
simmons
had
a
tennessee
accent.
when
he
was
interrogated
as
to
how
he
knew
that
it
was
a
tennessee
accent,
he
said,
“well,
i
spent
a
couple
of
years
in
alabama
and
south
carolina
and
the
people
from
tennessee
speak
faster.”
and
this
is
about
the
only
basis
that
he
had
for
it.
now,
it
should
be
noted
that
at
the
time
he
made
this
statement,
the
fbi
knew
that
simmons
was
living
in
pulaski,
tennessee.
so,
under
all
these
circumstances,
the
possibility
and
the
likelihood
of
suggestion
in
this
case
with
the
use
of
the
multiple
photographs
particularly
of
simmons
and
also
the
limitation
of
the
number
of
people
in
the
lineup.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
that
is
garrett
your
honor.
yes,
i
am.
the
government's
argument
is
that
it
--
they
really
don't
really
contest
this
business
about
the
use
of
the
multiple
photographs.
they
really
say,
“well,
andrews
was
our
prime
suspect
too
and
he
wasn't
identified?”
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
first
of
all,
the
number
of
pictures
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
it
doesn't
concede
that
but
it
concedes
the
factual
situation
involved
of
the
use
--
the
multiple
use
of
the
pictures
your
honor
and
it
really
doesn't
answer
this
in
any
way
or
try
to
justify
it.
all
it
says
is
that
well,
andrews
was
a
prime
suspect
and
he
wasn't
identified.
however,
he
might
have
been
a
prime
suspect
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
but
--
simmons
was
the
one
that
they
used
the
three
or
four
pictures
on
and
he
was
the
one
that
they
focused
on
at
the
time
of
the
critical
time
of
the
identification.
now,
all
these
means
is
that
there
were
two
men
in
the
bank.
one
was
small
and
dark
and
the
other
was
tall
and
lean
and
that
the
witnesses
considering
the
four
pictures
of
simmons
involved
thought
that
simmons
resembled
the
man,
the
tall,
thin
man
more
than
andrews.
however,
they
did
look
alike
enough
so
that
one
witness
identified
andrews
in
the
courtroom
and
then
later
changed
her
testimony
to
the
fact
that
it
was
simmons.
now,
all
other
witnesses
in
the
case
actually
tie
up
simmons
--
andrews
much
more
to
the
case
than
tie
andrews
up
to
the
case
much
more
than
simmons.
it
was
simmons
--
andrews
who
picked
up
the
car
before
and
after
and
delivered
it.
it
was
andrews
who
was
seen
with
garrett
before
the
bank
robbery
and
was
seen
coming
with
him
after
the
bank
robbery
and
not
simmons.
so
the
real
possibility
exists
that
because
of
this
focusing
on
simmons,
the
wrong
man
might
have
been
identified
and
that
it
could
actually
have
been
andrews
involved
in
the
bank
robbery.
the
last
part
of
the
argument
on
this
point
by
the
government
is
that
they
mentioned
certain
commentators
who
have
said
that
evils
--
have
listed
12
evils
that
exist
in
pretrial
identification
and
that
out
of
these
12
only
one
exists
in
the
simmons
case.
well,
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
same
one
the
short
period
of
time
that
the
witness
sees
the
accused
during
the
crime
is
the
only
one
present
in
stovall
versus
denno
too.
so,
the
commentators
apparently
did
not
conceive
that
the
fbi
situation
here
were
to
use
some
multiple
ictures.
now,
the
second
point
is
that
--
i
will
go
on
to
the
third
point,
your
honor
in
answer
to
your
question
then.
we
have
here
the
issue
presented
by
the
petitioner
garrett
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
allowing
his
statement
in
support
of
his
motion
to
suppress
to
be
used
by
the
government
in
its
case
in
chief
to
prove
ownership
of
certain
damaging
evidence
that
was
seized
from
the
home
of
andrews'
mother.
now,
the
government
was
going
to
introduce
this
evidence,
these
money
wrappers
from
the
bank
and
other
incriminating
evidence,
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
petitioner,
garrett
made
a
motion
to
suppress
this
evidence
and
in
support
thereof
testified
that
the
suitcase
and
the
contents
of
that
suitcase
were
his.
over
the
objection
of
both
simmons
and
garrett,
the
government
was
allowed
to
introduce
into
evidence
the
testimony
of
garrett
in
support
of
his
motion
to
suppress.
now,
the
cases
--
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
garrett
here
that
he
was
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma,
he
was
forced
to
sacrifice
under
the
court's
ruling
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
in
order
to
enforce
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
the
government's
cited
cases
and
the
reasoning
of
the
government
and
the
cases
that
they
have
cited
is
basically
this,
and
here
is
i
think
the
most
important
factor
here
--
is
that
just
like
any
--
this
is
a
situation
just
like
any
other
trial.
a
defendant
doesn't
have
to
take
the
stand
and
if
he
does
take
the
stand,
he
is
responsible
for
his
acts
and
they
can
be
later
used
against
him.
well,
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
situation
that
should
be
applied
in
a
motion
to
suppress
because
in
the
trial
of
an
ordinary
case,
the
defendant
has
absolutely
no
burden.
he
has
the
presumption
of
innocence.
the
government
must
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
defendant
need
to
present
no
evidence,
it
can
just
rely
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
of
the
government.
but
this
is
not
the
case
on
a
motion
to
suppress.
he
has
the
burden
of
proof.
the
defendant
does.
he
must
show
that
this
evidence
was
obtained
improperly.
and
therefore,
and
under
those
circumstances,
he
really
is,
unlike
a
trial
of
the
ordinary
case,
really
is
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma.
and
it
shouldn't
be
a
gamble
situation
in
the
united
states
district
court
that
if
we
are
successful
then
we
can
have
this
--
they
can
never
use
our
statement
against
us.
it
should
be
that
he
--
this
statement
that
he
makes
in
support
of
his
motion
to
suppress
cannot
be
used
against
him
whether
his
motion
to
suppress
is
successful
or
not.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
well,
your
honor,
here
is
a
factual
situation
there.
simmons
did
object
to
this
--
to
the
use
of
this
testimony.
however,
the
trial
court
did
not
allow
this
incriminating
evidence
in
against
simmons.
the
only
evidence
that
--
the
only
person
that
it
was
allowed
in
against
was
the
petitioner,
garrett.
however,
once
that
evidence
got
in,
it
was
so
damaging
that
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
for
the
jury
to
erase
from
its
mind
the
fact
of
the
bank
money
wrappers
and
that
coupled
with
this
identification
of
the
people
in
the
bank
made
it
impossible
for
simmons
to
get
a
fair
trial.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
not
at
all.
not
at
all
your
honor
and
none
of
that
evidence
was
introduced
against
simmons.
however,
my
only
point
is
that
once
it
got
in,
there
had
been
a
connection
shown
between
simmons
and
garrett
through
other
testimony
and
once
it
gets
in
that
garrett
has
this
incriminating
evidence
in
his
possession
in
the
house
of
the
mother-in-law
of
simmons
then
the
jury
was
unable
to
find
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
the
admissibility
of
the
statement
of
garrett,
yes.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
i
do
not
your
honor.
you
mean
as
far
as
whether
or
not
the
motion
to
suppress
should
have
been
granted
or
not.
no,
i
do
not.
at
this
stage,
your
honor.
i
do
not
challenge
that.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
well,
based
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
were
sufficient
grounds
and
that
they
held
that
there
was
consent
on
the
part
of
the
mother
to
search
the
house.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they
could
have
had
--
had
he
not
taken
the
witness
stand
but
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
well,
he
didn't
know
what
government
had
to
begin
with.
and
secondly,
your
honor
wouldn't
that
be
a
terrible
situation
if
the
government
introduced
its
evidence
and
really
didn't
tied
in
with
any
one
particular
man?
it
might
have
been
that
the
jury
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
andrews'
suitcase
and
here
is
a
man
whose
case
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
he
might
have
been
convicted
on
the
basis
of
the
suitcase
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
received
in
evidence.
i
think
it
would
have
because
it
had
been
found
in
the
house
of
the
mother
of
andrews.
yes,
i
do.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
that
anything
he
says
unless
they
had
a
statement
to
that
effect
given
on
another
occasion
but
anything
that
he
for
the
first
time
says
on
his
motion
to
suppress
should
be
unavailable
in
the
government's
case
in
chief.
and
the
last
point
i
wish
to
mention
was
that
the
photograph
should
have
been
producible
under
section
3500,
two
witnesses
at
least
said
that
they
had
spoken
with
the
fbi
concerning
those
statements
and
therefore
any
statement
that
was
given
would
be
--
wouldn't
make
any
sense
unless
you
had
the
photographs.
if
a
witness
says,
“that's
the
man
that
robbed
the
bank”
to
the
fbi
and
there's
a
photograph
of
them,
without
that
photograph,
there
can't
be
adequate
cross-examination.
and
i
think
that
it
--
since
it
is
part
of
the
statement
in
a
way
that
it
should
be
producible
under
section
3500
especially
in
this
case
of
all
others
where
it
was
so
critical
of
issue
of
identification
of
the
bank
robbers.
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
your
honor
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
only
in
the
sense
that
on
the
motion
for
judgment
of
the
court
to
let
the
close
of
all
the
evidence
if
this
motion
was
--
if
this
evidence
was
obtained
in
violation
of
the
due
process
then
there
would
be
no
other
evidence
left
but
per
se,
it
was
not
raised
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
it
was
not
argued
as
far
as
this
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
it's
certainly
was,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes
it
did.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
that
speaks
specifically
of
the
due
process
question,
your
honor.
but
it
definitely
was
raised
in
the
brief
and
they
just
kind
of
went
to
the
question
of
whether
the
real
thing
here
they
said
was
there
was
enough
cross-examination
and
it
goes
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
that's
all
they
considered
about
the
pictures.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes
it
was.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor
i
think
it
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
the
jencks?
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no,
i
would
not
say
that
that
would
be
a
constitutional
question.
no
i
would
not.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
no
i
do
not,
you
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
i
think
there
are
two
questions,
your
honor.
one
of
the
photographs
are
producible,
and
two,
whether
the
due
process
question
comes
up
in
the
use
of
the
photographs
by
the
fbi
in
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
definitely,
your
honor.
completely
independent.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
none,
just
the
jencks
act.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor
then
there
would
be
--
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
smith
thank
you
very
much.
