justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
challenge
the
merits
of
the
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
admissibility
of
--
yes,
but
how
about
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
found
in
the
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
as
far
as
you're
concerned
the
--
why
don't
you
challenge
that?
is
it
because
of
the
consent
of
the
mother
or
the
mother-in-law
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
was
it
that
the
government
could
ever
have
tied
the
contents
of
the
suitcases
with
either
one
of
these
defendants
if
the
mother-in-law
said,
“i
don't
know
the
suitcases
they
are
anything
of
a
kind”?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
he
feel
compelled
to
take
the
witness
stand
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
they
could
have
--
the
evidence
would
have
been
introduced,
they
just
thought
that
here
are
some
clothes
we
found
somewhere
some
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if,
mr.
solicitor
--
what
if
the
lady
had
said
why
those
suitcases
belong
to
mr.
garrett
or
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
are
here
in
my
house
and
you
certainly
may
search
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
what
if
she
said
no,
“i
don't
know
whose
suitcases
these
are”
but
what
if
the
police
knew
whose
they
were?
they
didn't
tell
her
anything
they
just
said
“we
want
to
search
these
suitcases”
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
shouldn't
the
constitution
protect
the
facts
as
well
as
the
house
or
some
--
some
living
quarters?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
the
police
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
have
no
right
to
get
into
that
suitcase
do
they
--
just
because
it
happens
to
be
in
somebody
else's
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
been
abandoned?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
--
you
think
there
was
a
probable
cause
to
--
do
you
think
the
officers
could
have
shown
probable
cause
to
search
the
suitcases?
do
you
think
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
to
search
those
suitcases?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
the
house
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
warden
against
hayden
doesn't
relieve
the
necessity
for
having
probable
cause
or
for
getting
a
warrant
except
in
an
extraordinary
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not,
mr.
solicitor
general?
why
wouldn't
it
be
--
why
wouldn't
it
be
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
suggest
that
the
refusal
of
the
trial
judge
to
order
that
the
pictures
to
be
produced
if
not
within
the
government's
obligation
under
the
jencks
statute
may
nevertheless
have
been
the
government's
obligation
as
a
constitutional
matter?
do
you
suggest
that's
a
due
process
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
it's
a
confrontation
matter,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
constitutional
right
do
you
rely
on
as
far
as
their
production
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
challenge
the
merits
of
the
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
admissibility
of
--
yes,
but
how
about
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
found
in
the
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
as
far
as
you're
concerned
the
--
why
don't
you
challenge
that?
is
it
because
of
the
consent
of
the
mother
or
the
mother-in-law
or
what?
justice
byron
r.

how
was

what

she

no,

what
if
