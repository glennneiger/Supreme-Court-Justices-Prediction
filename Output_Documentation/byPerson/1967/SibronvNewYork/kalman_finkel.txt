mr.
kalman
finkel
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
it
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
convicting
the
appellant
of
the
crime
of
possession
of
narcotics
as
a
misdemeanor
after
a
preliminary
motion
to
suppress
evidence
was
denied.
since
the
judgment
was
predicated
on
a
plea
of
guilty,
under
new
york
practice,
the
only
issue
litigated
on
appeal,
both
at
the
intermediate
state
appellate
court
and
to
the
to
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
whether
the
appellant’s
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
evidence
against
him
was
obtained.
no
majority
opinion
was
written
in
this
case.
however,
the
dissenting
opinion
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
amendment
to
its
(inaudible)
indicate
that
in
affirming
the
judgment
of
conviction,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
considered
appellant’s
contention,
that
section
188
of
the
new
york
code
of
criminal
procedure
was
unconstitutional
and
found
“that
the
statute
does
not
authorize
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure”
and
that
in
this
case
there
was
no
denial
of
the
defendant’s,
appellant’s
constitutional
rights.
briefly
your
honor
the
pertinent
facts
adduced
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
stress
were
as
follows.
patrolman
martin
testified
that
while
in
uniform,
he
observed
the
appellant
for
a
period
of
eight
hours
standing
on
the
street.
the
officer
had
no
information
concerning
the
appellant.
during
the
prior
period
of
his
observation
appellant
was
seen
conversing
to
six
--
with
six
or
eight
known
drug
addicts.
the
officer
explicitly
testified
that
he
did
not
overhear
any
of
the
conversation.
no
money
passed
during
the
entire
period
of
any
–
of
these
observations,
nor
did
any
narcotics
passed.
the
officer
then
observed
the
appellant
enter
a
restaurant,
sit
down,
order
coffee
and
pie
and
converse
with
another
three
--
three
different
addicts.
again
the
officer
did
not
overhear
any
of
the
conversation.
the
officer
entered
the
restaurant,
went
over
to
the
appellant
and
told
him
to
please
come
outside
with
him.
appellant
complied
with
the
officer's
request
and
what
transpired
then
can
be
best
summarized
at
page
16
of
the
record
and
i
quote,
“i
said
meaning
patrolman
martin,
you
know
what
i
am
after?
appellant,
he,
meaning
appellant
reached
into
his
pocket
and
he
held
something
into
his
hand,
at
the
same
time
i
went
into
his
pocket.
a
metal
tin
foil
wrapper
containing
narcotics
was
seized.”
it
is
noteworthy
your
honor
that
the
officer
in
his
sworn
complaint
stated
that
appellant
did
put
his
hand
in
his
left
jacket
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
tin
foiled
envelope
and
did
attempt
to
throw
the
same
to
the
ground.
the
following
question
was
also
asked
to
the
officer.
you
didn't
think,
when
you
reached
into
his
pocket,
you
didn't
think
he
was
reaching
for
a
weapon.
answer
“i
thought
he
might
have
been.”
appellant
testified
your
honor
that
he
was
talking
with
these
known
drug
addicts
about
narcotic
people.
he
also
testified
that
when
the
officer
came
over
to
him
and
asked
him
to
come
and
he
accompanied
the
officer
outside,
the
officer
stated
to
him
you
know
what
i
am
after,
appellant
replied
no,
the
officer
then
searched
him.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony
defense
counsel
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
on
the
ground
that
the
officer
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
was
committed.
initially
the
court
was
disposed
to
grant
the
motion.
the
court
reminded
the
district
attorney
that
the
officer
didn't
overhear
any
of
the
conversations
and
the
appellant
could
have
been
talking
about
the
cassius
clay
fight
with
these
non-drug
addicts.
the
officer
refused
the
--
excuse
me
refused
to
find
that
appellant
consented
to
the
search.
the
district
attorney
didn't
pursue
any
theory
of
abandonment.
however
the
district
attorney
reminded
the
court
that
appellant
at
the
suppression
hearing
admitted
that
he
was
talking
about
narcotics.
defense
counsel
objected
on
the
ground
that
this
totally
irrelevant
because
the
officer
explicitly
testified
that
he
did
not
overhear
any
of
the
conversations,
nonetheless
the
court
found
that
the
officer's
action
was
predicated
on
probably
cause
and
denied
defendant's
motion
to
suppress.
at
the
appellate
term
level
the
people
abandoned
the
theory
of
probable
cause
and
instead
argued
that
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
suppress
could
be
justified
under
section
180
(a)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
the
appellate
term
affirmed
without
opinion.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
appellant
argued
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
it's
face,
because
it
authorized
a
stop
and
search
on
a
standard
of
less
than
probable
cause
and
even
assuming
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
inapplicable
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
in
this
case
the
officer
didn't
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
a
crime
was
committed
more
than
he
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
he
was
in
danger
of
life
or
limb.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
two
justices
dissenting.
your
honor
--
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
discuss
here
now
exactly
the
powers
that
the
police
have
under
this
statute,
the
conduct
that
is
authorized.
judge
keating
writing
in
a
majority
opinion
in
people
v.
peters
stated
that
under
vast
analysis
it
is
not
the
language
employed
that
counts,
but
it's
the
conduct
that
is
authorized.
we
wholeheartedly
agree,
we
must
look
to
way
the
court
of
appeals
has
construed
this
statute.
however,
before
we
deal
with
what
we
consider
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
your
honor,
however
we
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
think
you
should
your
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yeah
i
think
you
should
your
honor.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well
because
this
statute
your
honor
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes
your
honor,
but
this
case
is
different
and
the
reason
it
is
different
your
honor,
this
statue
is
broad,
we
concede
that
--
we
think
it's
board
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
because
the
construction
given
to
the
statute
without
this
case
--
there
was
no
construction
given
to
this
statute.
this
statute
is
different
than
any
other
statute.
ordinarily
this
court
can
just
as
applied
reverse
the
conviction,
but
here
you
shouldn't
do
this
for
the
following
reason.
number
one,
this
statue
on
its
face
is
a
radical
departure
from
existing
standards.
there
is
no
case
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kalman
finkel
you
have
the
question
posed
in
the
other
cases
your
honor
and
the
confession
in
error
in
my
understanding
is
this
court's
decision
united
states
v.
young
and
(inaudible)
versus
united
states,
that
this
court
is
not
necessarily
bound
by
a
confession
of
error
they
will
make
their
own
independent
review
of
the
facts
and
therefore
i
feel
that
title
had
discussed
the
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
kalman
finkel
you
can,
but
i
think
that
this
particular
case,
sibron
will
show
the
over
breadth
of
this
statute
and
therefore
the
whole
statute
should
go
with
it.
mr.
kalman
finkel
right,
it's
true
your
honor,
but
if
i
was
assured
that
this
court
would
rely
on
the
confession
of
error
and
my
conviction
would
be
reversed,
i
would
stop
arguing,
but
i'm
not
assured
that
this
court
is
bound
by
the
district
attorney's
confession
of
error.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
yes
your
honor
and
we
are
arguing
alternative
grounds
for
reversal.
we
are
not
only
relying
upon
the
special
judge
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
your
honors
before
i
deal
with
reconsider,
the
proper
construction
of
this
statute
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
district
attorney's
brief
and
other
amicus
briefs.
your
honors
the
districts
attorneys
are
--
what
they're
coming
here
and
they're
telling
you
to
forget
either
what
new
york
has
done
and
instead
rely
on
some
hypothetical
situation
that
they
are
going
to
set
up
sometime
to
cite
this
case
is
--
this
case
as
if
there
was
only
an
abstract
statute,
as
if
they're
coming
here
under
the
declaratory
judgment
instead
of
looking
to
the
actual
construction
given
this
statute
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
for
instance
let
me
--
the
district
attorney
of
kings
county
emphasizes
in
his
brief
at
page
nine
that
this
statue
grants
no
power
to
detain
and
therefore
the
issue
of
detention
is
not
present
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
new
york
county
district
attorney
talks
in
terms
of
a
brief
detention.
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
talks
in
terms
of
a
minor
intrusion.
the
solicitor
general
is
not
speaking
about
this
particular
statute,
but
about
stop
and
frisk
in
general,
talks
in
terms
of
a
limited
detention
for
the
purpose
of
questioning.
your
honors,
if
the
--
we
concede
right
here
now
that
the
police
have
a
right
to
stop
someone
provided
noncoercive,
nonforcible
and
the
man
knows
he's
free
to
leave,
but
that's
not
what
new
york
has
done.
there
are
basically
your
honor
five
cases
in
this
area.
two
of
the
cases
people
v.
--
decided
about
court
of
appeals,
two
of
the
cases
people
v.
pugach
and
people
v.
rivera
are
pre-statutory
vintage.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
in
construing
the
statute
relies
on
those
cases
and
we
will
discuss
five
cases
as
total
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
concede
that
the
police
have
a
right
to
stop
someone
on
less
than
probable
cause
provided
it's
a
nonforcible,
noncoercive
stop
and
the
man
knows
or
a
reasonable
man
and
this
defendants
place
with
no,
that
he
--
he
does
not
have
to
answer
the
question
and
that
he
is
free
to
leave.
i
will
even
go
further
and
say
you
don't
even
need
reasonable
suspicion
for
that.
mr.
kalman
finkel
you
don't
even
have
to
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
do
that
that
officer
has
that
right,
but
that's
not
what
new
york
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kalman
finkel
correct.
in
people
v.
peters
your
honors,
the
court
of
appeals
sanctioned
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yeah.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
your
honor
i
don't
i
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
i
said
provided
a
reasonable
man
in
his
place,
a
reasonable
man
in
his
place
here
would
think
he
is
not
free
to
leave.
provided
a
reasonable
man
in
this
defendant
place
would
think
that
he
is
free
to
leave
stopped
late
at
night
by
a
policeman
armed,
it's
unclear,
and
it
depends
on
interpretation
but
in
those
situation
it's
possible
that
the
man
would
not
think,
a
reasonable
man
would
not
think
he's
free
to
leave
and
therefore
that
would
not
be
permitted
under
my
definition
of
without
probable
cause.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
number
one,
your
honor,
because
this
court
has
said
that
they
could
still
make
an
independent,
i'm
agreeing
to
the
facts
and
i'm
not
bound
by
the
stipulation
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i'm
sorry,
this
court
still
stated
that
they
must
make
and
this
is
in
(inaudible)
versus
united
states,
they
can
make
an
independent
inquiry
and
they
won't
be
bound
by
the
stipulations
of
the
body.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yeah,
but
your
honor
this
case,
we
deem
this
case
is,
the
confession
of
error
in
this
just
indicates
to
us
the
overreaching
of
the
statute.
to
us
this
statute
is
far
broader
than
in
the
burgett
situation
where
this
court
reached
out
--
this
court
decided
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
in
burgett
for
instance,
the
officer's
action
is
still
motivated
upon
probable
cause.
true
there
was
a
magistrate
involved
in
the
burgett
situation
yet
this
court
summarized
the
entire
statute
and
didn't
just
applied
to
the
facts
of
an
individual
case.
here
too,
your
honor,
i
know
we
will
gladly
settle
for
the
reversal,
but
we
feel
that
that
the
district
attorney
or
this
difficult
constitutional
issue
cannot
be
avoided
by
the
district
attorney's
confession
of
error
on
this
case.
mr.
kalman
finkel
that
would
definitely
satisfy
me
your
honor.
[laughter]i
didn't
satisfy
with
the
first
point
your
honor
its
the
reverse
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i'm
definitely
will
be
satisfied
with
the
other
but
i'm,
but
i'm
not
certain
that
this
court
–
i
am
still
uncertain
that
this
court
is
bound
or
will
give
credence
to
the
confession
of
error.
and
in
your
own
independent
review
of
facts
you
might
come
to
a
different
conclusion,
therefore
i
feel
that
i
must
argue
the
entire
statute
and
its
application.
and
the
district
attorney
is,
what
he's
trying
to
do
is
just
the
divorce
the
facts
your
honor
of
this
case
in
the
statute,
divorce
the
facts
of
pugach
from,
people
v.
pugach
from
the
statute,
divorce
the
facts
of
peters
case
because
not
his
case
and
you
left
the
statute
in
the
vacuum
and
that's
not
the
way
this
court
decides
in
my
reading
of
the
constitutional
issues.
they
always
look
to
the
construction
given
by
the
higher
state
court
and
i'm
now
going
into
that
construction
what
we
deem
to
be
the
construction
given
by
the
highest
state
court.
in
peters,
for
instance,
your
honor
the
officer
had
the
power
to
draw
his
gun
on
peters
and
to
grab
him
by
the
shirt
collar
and
people
v.
taggart
relying
on
anonymous
phone
call
the
officer
had
the
power
to
go
immediately
to
taggart,
grab
him
by
the
arm
and
reach
into
his
pocket.
in
people
v.
pugach
the
court
gave
the
police
the
power
to
move
pugach
from
the
building
into
a
police
car
and
in
this
case
your
honor
the
officer
had
the
power
to
remove
sibron
who
was
in
a
restaurant
and
ask
him
to
accompany
him
outside.
your
honor
we
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
sanctioned
under
the
definition
of
stop,
to
use
of
force,
the
laying
of
the
hands
upon
individual
and
then
removing
him
from
one
place
to
another
including
a
police
car.
this
your
honor,
this
your
honor
is
a
seizure
of
the
person
prohibited
unless
than
probable
cause.
applying
our
standard
whether
the
man
is
free
to
leave,
it's
quite
clear
that
none
of
these
defendants
were
free
to
leave.
the
officer
in
this
particular
case
was
looking
for
something.
he
stated,
you
know,
what
i'm
after,
you
know,
what
i'm
looking
for
he
would
not
have
allowed
sibron
to
leave.
sibron's
movement
was
completely
restrained.
we
read
your
honor
that
the
history,
the
seizure
part
of
the,
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
particularly
the
brinegar
decision,
the
henry
decision
and
the
rios
decision
are
standing
for
the
proposition
that
these
types
of
restrains
are
prohibited
unless
than
probable
cause.
yet
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
has
sanctioned
this
very
procedure
on
a
standard
less
than
probable
cause.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no.
mr.
kalman
finkel
they
contented
that
they
had
probable
cause.
mr.
kalman
finkel
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
trial
court
but
our
intermediate
appellate
court
has
the
right
to
review
both
law
and
facts
and
there
it
was
raised
and
they
affirmed.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
in
the
appellate
court,
your
honor,
the
district
attorney
confessed
error
there
was
no
problem.
of
course
he
argued
instead
that
the
search
can
only
be
sustained
under
section
180
of
the
code
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
he
argued
that
and
it's
clear
from
the
dissenting
opinions
of
justice
van
voorhis
and
justice
fuld
that
no
one,
everyone
is
in
the
agreement
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
in
this
case.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
they
go
much
further
they
said
there
wasn't
even
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
kalman
finkel
that
they're
willing
to
say
that
there
was
even
reasonable
suspicion
in
this
case.
with
respect
your
honors
to
the
power
to
search
under
this
statute
it
is
no
longer
open
question
that
the
word
search
in
this
statute
means
search.
in
people
v.
taggart
where
the
court
of
appeals
summed
up
what
they
had
said
in
all
the
other
previous
cases,
they
said
that
what
occurred
in
pugach,
what
occurred
in
taggart,
what
occurred
in
sibron
were
oral
searches
and
not
frisks.
they've
gone
far
beyond
that
limited
pre-statutory
holding
in
rivera
with
a
limited
search
to
a
frisk,
a
patting
of
the
outer
clothing.
here
they
say
that
they
are
talking
about
search
and
they
mean
search.
so
what
emerges
your
honor
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
the
policeman
is
quite
simple.
they
have
the
same
powers
that
they
ordinarily
would
only
have
under
probably
cause,
the
power
to
cease
someone
and
the
power
to
search
for
evidence
and
introduce
that
evidence
whatever
they
found,
whether
gun
or
any
other
put
into
criminal
prosecution
on
a
standard
of
less
than
probable
cause.
now
your
honor
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
standard.
the
standard
is
reasonable
suspicion.
reasonable
suspicion
is
used
in
two
separate
contexts
with
the
same
definition;
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
a
crime
is
or
will
be
committed
and
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
the
officer
is
in
danger
of
life
or
limb.
the
court
of
appeals
has
defined
reasonable
suspicion
as
follows
and
i
quote
from
the
peter's
opinion,
“probably
cause
requires
satisfactory
grounds
for
believing
that
a
crime
was
committed
while
reasonable
suspicion
requires
satisfactory
grounds
for
suspecting
that
a
crime
was
committed.”
the
difference
between
these
two
standards
is
proportionate
to
the
difference
and
degree
of
invasion
between
an
arrest
and
a
detention
between
a
full
search
and
a
frisk.
the
court
went
on
to
state
that
the
standard
incorporates
“the
experienced
police
officer
intuitive
knowledge
and
appraisal
of
appearances
of
criminal
activity.
his
evaluation
of
the
various
factors
involve,
ensures
a
protective
as
well
as
definitive
standing.”
your
honors,
one
is
immediately
struck
by
two
aspects
in
this
quote.
number
one,
the
court
of
appeals
in
taggart,
a
subsequent
decision
acknowledged
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
a
full
search
and
a
frisk.
they
have
acknowledged
that
this
statute
gives
the
right
to
search.
secondly
with
rather
striking
your
honor
is
the
fact
that
it
is
the
officer's
evaluation,
his
intuitive
knowledge
that
has
given
primary
emphasis,
very
subjective
and
i
say
your
honors
let
us
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
now
we
can
see
how
subjective
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
is.
in
this
case
basically
the
most
that
the
officer
heard
was
or
most
of
the
officer
observed
was
not
overheard
conversation
between
appellant,
a
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
and
various
drug
addicts.
yet
the
court
was
willing
to
say
that
that
was
reasonable
suspicion,
the
officers
there
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
appellant
is
committing
a
crime.
you
don't
have
to
prophesize
to
be
able
to
do
that
in
any
case
where
the
officer
was
so
and
has
a
record,
where
he
has
information
or
where
he
knows
he
is
a
drug
addict
any
of
these
people,
if
they
are
sitting
in
a
restaurant
of
course
the
officer
would
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
remove
those
people
from
the
restaurant
on
to
the
street.
likewise
your
honor
in
rivera
great
reliance
is
placed
on
high
crime
rate
and
the
lateness
of
the
evening.
in
that
case
your
honor
anyone
walking
down
the
street
late
at
night
is
possibly
reasonably
suspect.
now
the
district
attorney
says,
agreed
that
in
this
particular
case
the
officer
did
not
have
reasonable
suspicion.
however,
he
does
say
one
thing.
he
says
the
court
of
appeals
in
taggart
had
second
thoughts
about
this
case
and
it
had
this
case
come
to
the
court
subsequent
to
taggart,
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
reversed
this
decision.
your
honor,
with
all
due
difference
to
mr.
siegel
this
procedure
he
has
completely
misread
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
taggart
case.
number
one
in
taggart,
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
that
sibron
was
a
case
involving
reasonable
suspicion
and
adopted
the
reasoning
of
that
case.
the
district
attorney
on
page
46
of
his
brief
relies
on
this
court
from
the
court's
opinion
in
taggart
to
sustain
his
proposition,
“needless
to
add
the
serious
problem
is
suggested
only
in
cases
involving
serious
personal
injury
or
grave
irreparable
property
damage
and
not
by
the
problems
associated
with
the
enforcement
of
certiorari
laws
such
as
narcotics
violation.”
however,
the
district
attorney
forgot
to
read
the
previous
paragraph
which
states,
“there
are
exigencies
affecting
life,
limb,
or
great
property
damage
in
which
the
police
receive
information
of
crime
and
not
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause,
but
on
which
they
must
act.
but
the
court
of
appeals
meant
in
taggart
your
honor
quite
simply
is
this.
where
the
police
receive
an
anonymous
phone
call
that
a
man
is
engaged
in
violating
the
narcotics
law,
they
can
go
over
to
him
and
immediately
grab
him
by
the
arm
and
search
him.
however
where
they
receive
a
anonymous
information
that
a
man
has
a
gun
in
his
pocket,
they
can't
do
that,
but
nowhere
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
taggart
intimate
that
what
the
officer
observed
in
this
case
the
non-overheard
conversation
between
sibron
and
these
known
drug
addicts
was
something
less
that
probable
cause.
your
honors,
i
am
going
to
conclude
my
part
of
the
argument
with,
i
think
i've
attempted
to
show
where
this
statue
is
vulnerable
to
constitutional
attack
on
many
grounds
and
i
am
leaving
your
honor
for
mrs.
oberman
will
discuss
what
i
consider
the
great
vice
of
this
statue
and
that
is
with
the
second
context
of
reasonable
suspicion,
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
the
officer
is
in
danger
of
life
or
limb.
there
your
honor,
i
just
want
to
briefly
state
that
we
maintain
that
there
was
a
--
it
is
a
total
judicial
adjudication
to
the
judgment
of
the
police,
thank
you.
mr.
kalman
finkel
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
it
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
convicting
the
appellant
of
the
crime
of
possession
of
narcotics
as
a
misdemeanor
after
a
preliminary
motion
to
suppress
evidence
was
denied.
since
the
judgment
was
predicated
on
a
plea
of
guilty,
under
new
york
practice,
the
only
issue
litigated
on
appeal,
both
at
the
intermediate
state
appellate
court
and
to
the
to
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
whether
the
appellant’s
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
evidence
against
him
was
obtained.
no
majority
opinion
was
written
in
this
case.
however,
the
dissenting
opinion
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
amendment
to
its
(inaudible)
indicate
that
in
affirming
the
judgment
of
conviction,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
considered
appellant’s
contention,
that
section
188
of
the
new
york
code
of
criminal
procedure
was
unconstitutional
and
found
“that
the
statute
does
not
authorize
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure”
and
that
in
this
case
there
was
no
denial
of
the
defendant’s,
appellant’s
constitutional
rights.
briefly
your
honor
the
pertinent
facts
adduced
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
stress
were
as
follows.
patrolman
martin
testified
that
while
in
uniform,
he
observed
the
appellant
for
a
period
of
eight
hours
standing
on
the
street.
the
officer
had
no
information
concerning
the
appellant.
during
the
prior
period
of
his
observation
appellant
was
seen
conversing
to
six
--
with
six
or
eight
known
drug
addicts.
the
officer
explicitly
testified
that
he
did
not
overhear
any
of
the
conversation.
no
money
passed
during
the
entire
period
of
any
–
of
these
observations,
nor
did
any
narcotics
passed.
the
officer
then
observed
the
appellant
enter
a
restaurant,
sit
down,
order
coffee
and
pie
and
converse
with
another
three
--
three
different
addicts.
again
the
officer
did
not
overhear
any
of
the
conversation.
the
officer
entered
the
restaurant,
went
over
to
the
appellant
and
told
him
to
please
come
outside
with
him.
appellant
complied
with
the
officer's
request
and
what
transpired
then
can
be
best
summarized
at
page
16
of
the
record
and
i
quote,
“i
said
meaning
patrolman
martin,
you
know
what
i
am
after?
appellant,
he,
meaning
appellant
reached
into
his
pocket
and
he
held
something
into
his
hand,
at
the
same
time
i
went
into
his
pocket.
a
metal
tin
foil
wrapper
containing
narcotics
was
seized.”
it
is
noteworthy
your
honor
that
the
officer
in
his
sworn
complaint
stated
that
appellant
did
put
his
hand
in
his
left
jacket
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
tin
foiled
envelope
and
did
attempt
to
throw
the
same
to
the
ground.
the
following
question
was
also
asked
to
the
officer.
you
didn't
think,
when
you
reached
into
his
pocket,
you
didn't
think
he
was
reaching
for
a
weapon.
answer
“i
thought
he
might
have
been.”
appellant
testified
your
honor
that
he
was
talking
with
these
known
drug
addicts
about
narcotic
people.
he
also
testified
that
when
the
officer
came
over
to
him
and
asked
him
to
come
and
he
accompanied
the
officer
outside,
the
officer
stated
to
him
you
know
what
i
am
after,
appellant
replied
no,
the
officer
then
searched
him.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony
defense
counsel
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
on
the
ground
that
the
officer
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
was
committed.
initially
the
court
was
disposed
to
grant
the
motion.
the
court
reminded
the
district
attorney
that
the
officer
didn't
overhear
any
of
the
conversations
and
the
appellant
could
have
been
talking
about
the
cassius
clay
fight
with
these
non-drug
addicts.
the
officer
refused
the
--
excuse
me
refused
to
find
that
appellant
consented
to
the
search.
the
district
attorney
didn't
pursue
any
theory
of
abandonment.
however
the
district
attorney
reminded
the
court
that
appellant
at
the
suppression
hearing
admitted
that
he
was
talking
about
narcotics.
defense
counsel
objected
on
the
ground
that
this
totally
irrelevant
because
the
officer
explicitly
testified
that
he
did
not
overhear
any
of
the
conversations,
nonetheless
the
court
found
that
the
officer's
action
was
predicated
on
probably
cause
and
denied
defendant's
motion
to
suppress.
at
the
appellate
term
level
the
people
abandoned
the
theory
of
probable
cause
and
instead
argued
that
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
suppress
could
be
justified
under
section
180
(a)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
the
appellate
term
affirmed
without
opinion.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
appellant
argued
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
it's
face,
because
it
authorized
a
stop
and
search
on
a
standard
of
less
than
probable
cause
and
even
assuming
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
inapplicable
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
in
this
case
the
officer
didn't
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
a
crime
was
committed
more
than
he
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
he
was
in
danger
of
life
or
limb.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
two
justices
dissenting.
your
honor
--
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
discuss
here
now
exactly
the
powers
that
the
police
have
under
this
statute,
the
conduct
that
is
authorized.
judge
keating
writing
in
a
majority
opinion
in
people
v.
peters
stated
that
under
vast
analysis
it
is
not
the
language
employed
that
counts,
but
it's
the
conduct
that
is
authorized.
we
wholeheartedly
agree,
we
must
look
to
way
the
court
of
appeals
has
construed
this
statute.
however,
before
we
deal
with
what
we
consider
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
your
honor,
however
we
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
think
you
should
your
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yeah
i
think
you
should
your
honor.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well
because
this
statute
your
honor
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes
your
honor,
but
this
case
is
different
and
the
reason
it
is
different
your
honor,
this
statue
is
broad,
we
concede
that
--
we
think
it's
board
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
because
the
construction
given
to
the
statute
without
this
case
--
there
was
no
construction
given
to
this
statute.
this
statute
is
different
than
any
other
statute.
ordinarily
this
court
can
just
as
applied
reverse
the
conviction,
but
here
you
shouldn't
do
this
for
the
following
reason.
number
one,
this
statue
on
its
face
is
a
radical
departure
from
existing
standards.
there
is
no
case
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kalman
finkel
you
have
the
question
posed
in
the
other
cases
your
honor
and
the
confession
in
error
in
my
understanding
is
this
court's
decision
united
states
v.
young
and
(inaudible)
versus
united
states,
that
this
court
is
not
necessarily
bound
by
a
confession
of
error
they
will
make
their
own
independent
review
of
the
facts
and
therefore
i
feel
that
title
had
discussed
the
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
kalman
finkel
you
can,
but
i
think
that
this
particular
case,
sibron
will
show
the
over
breadth
of
this
statute
and
therefore
the
whole
statute
should
go
with
it.
mr.
kalman
finkel
right,
it's
true
your
honor,
but
if
i
was
assured
that
this
court
would
rely
on
the
confession
of
error
and
my
conviction
would
be
reversed,
i
would
stop
arguing,
but
i'm
not
assured
that
this
court
is
bound
by
the
district
attorney's
confession
of
error.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
yes
your
honor
and
we
are
arguing
alternative
grounds
for
reversal.
we
are
not
only
relying
upon
the
special
judge
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
your
honors
before
i
deal
with
reconsider,
the
proper
construction
of
this
statute
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
district
attorney's
brief
and
other
amicus
briefs.
your
honors
the
districts
attorneys
are
--
what
they're
coming
here
and
they're
telling
you
to
forget
either
what
new
york
has
done
and
instead
rely
on
some
hypothetical
situation
that
they
are
going
to
set
up
sometime
to
cite
this
case
is
--
this
case
as
if
there
was
only
an
abstract
statute,
as
if
they're
coming
here
under
the
declaratory
judgment
instead
of
looking
to
the
actual
construction
given
this
statute
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
for
instance
let
me
--
the
district
attorney
of
kings
county
emphasizes
in
his
brief
at
page
nine
that
this
statue
grants
no
power
to
detain
and
therefore
the
issue
of
detention
is
not
present
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
new
york
county
district
attorney
talks
in
terms
of
a
brief
detention.
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
talks
in
terms
of
a
minor
intrusion.
the
solicitor
general
is
not
speaking
about
this
particular
statute,
but
about
stop
and
frisk
in
general,
talks
in
terms
of
a
limited
detention
for
the
purpose
of
questioning.
your
honors,
if
the
--
we
concede
right
here
now
that
the
police
have
a
right
to
stop
someone
provided
noncoercive,
nonforcible
and
the
man
knows
he's
free
to
leave,
but
that's
not
what
new
york
has
done.
there
are
basically
your
honor
five
cases
in
this
area.
two
of
the
cases
people
v.
--
decided
about
court
of
appeals,
two
of
the
cases
people
v.
pugach
and
people
v.
rivera
are
pre-statutory
vintage.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
in
construing
the
statute
relies
on
those
cases
and
we
will
discuss
five
cases
as
total
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
concede
that
the
police
have
a
right
to
stop
someone
on
less
than
probable
cause
provided
it's
a
nonforcible,
noncoercive
stop
and
the
man
knows
or
a
reasonable
man
and
this
defendants
place
with
no,
that
he
--
he
does
not
have
to
answer
the
question
and
that
he
is
free
to
leave.
i
will
even
go
further
and
say
you
don't
even
need
reasonable
suspicion
for
that.
mr.
kalman
finkel
you
don't
even
have
to
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
do
that
that
officer
has
that
right,
but
that's
not
what
new
york
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kalman
finkel
correct.
in
people
v.
peters
your
honors,
the
court
of
appeals
sanctioned
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yeah.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
your
honor
i
don't
i
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
i
said
provided
a
reasonable
man
in
his
place,
a
reasonable
man
in
his
place
here
would
think
he
is
not
free
to
leave.
provided
a
reasonable
man
in
this
defendant
place
would
think
that
he
is
free
to
leave
stopped
late
at
night
by
a
policeman
armed,
it's
unclear,
and
it
depends
on
interpretation
but
in
those
situation
it's
possible
that
the
man
would
not
think,
a
reasonable
man
would
not
think
he's
free
to
leave
and
therefore
that
would
not
be
permitted
under
my
definition
of
without
probable
cause.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
number
one,
your
honor,
because
this
court
has
said
that
they
could
still
make
an
independent,
i'm
agreeing
to
the
facts
and
i'm
not
bound
by
the
stipulation
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i'm
sorry,
this
court
still
stated
that
they
must
make
and
this
is
in
(inaudible)
versus
united
states,
they
can
make
an
independent
inquiry
and
they
won't
be
bound
by
the
stipulations
of
the
body.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yeah,
but
your
honor
this
case,
we
deem
this
case
is,
the
confession
of
error
in
this
just
indicates
to
us
the
overreaching
of
the
statute.
to
us
this
statute
is
far
broader
than
in
the
burgett
situation
where
this
court
reached
out
--
this
court
decided
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
in
burgett
for
instance,
the
officer's
action
is
still
motivated
upon
probable
cause.
true
there
was
a
magistrate
involved
in
the
burgett
situation
yet
this
court
summarized
the
entire
statute
and
didn't
just
applied
to
the
facts
of
an
individual
case.
here
too,
your
honor,
i
know
we
will
gladly
settle
for
the
reversal,
but
we
feel
that
that
the
district
attorney
or
this
difficult
constitutional
issue
cannot
be
avoided
by
the
district
attorney's
confession
of
error
on
this
case.
mr.
kalman
finkel
that
would
definitely
satisfy
me
your
honor.
[laughter]i
didn't
satisfy
with
the
first
point
your
honor
its
the
reverse
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i'm
definitely
will
be
satisfied
with
the
other
but
i'm,
but
i'm
not
certain
that
this
court
–
i
am
still
uncertain
that
this
court
is
bound
or
will
give
credence
to
the
confession
of
error.
and
in
your
own
independent
review
of
facts
you
might
come
to
a
different
conclusion,
therefore
i
feel
that
i
must
argue
the
entire
statute
and
its
application.
and
the
district
attorney
is,
what
he's
trying
to
do
is
just
the
divorce
the
facts
your
honor
of
this
case
in
the
statute,
divorce
the
facts
of
pugach
from,
people
v.
pugach
from
the
statute,
divorce
the
facts
of
peters
case
because
not
his
case
and
you
left
the
statute
in
the
vacuum
and
that's
not
the
way
this
court
decides
in
my
reading
of
the
constitutional
issues.
they
always
look
to
the
construction
given
by
the
higher
state
court
and
i'm
now
going
into
that
construction
what
we
deem
to
be
the
construction
given
by
the
highest
state
court.
in
peters,
for
instance,
your
honor
the
officer
had
the
power
to
draw
his
gun
on
peters
and
to
grab
him
by
the
shirt
collar
and
people
v.
taggart
relying
on
anonymous
phone
call
the
officer
had
the
power
to
go
immediately
to
taggart,
grab
him
by
the
arm
and
reach
into
his
pocket.
in
people
v.
pugach
the
court
gave
the
police
the
power
to
move
pugach
from
the
building
into
a
police
car
and
in
this
case
your
honor
the
officer
had
the
power
to
remove
sibron
who
was
in
a
restaurant
and
ask
him
to
accompany
him
outside.
your
honor
we
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
sanctioned
under
the
definition
of
stop,
to
use
of
force,
the
laying
of
the
hands
upon
individual
and
then
removing
him
from
one
place
to
another
including
a
police
car.
this
your
honor,
this
your
honor
is
a
seizure
of
the
person
prohibited
unless
than
probable
cause.
applying
our
standard
whether
the
man
is
free
to
leave,
it's
quite
clear
that
none
of
these
defendants
were
free
to
leave.
the
officer
in
this
particular
case
was
looking
for
something.
he
stated,
you
know,
what
i'm
after,
you
know,
what
i'm
looking
for
he
would
not
have
allowed
sibron
to
leave.
sibron's
movement
was
completely
restrained.
we
read
your
honor
that
the
history,
the
seizure
part
of
the,
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
particularly
the
brinegar
decision,
the
henry
decision
and
the
rios
decision
are
standing
for
the
proposition
that
these
types
of
restrains
are
prohibited
unless
than
probable
cause.
yet
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
has
sanctioned
this
very
procedure
on
a
standard
less
than
probable
cause.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no.
mr.
kalman
finkel
they
contented
that
they
had
probable
cause.
mr.
kalman
finkel
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
trial
court
but
our
intermediate
appellate
court
has
the
right
to
review
both
law
and
facts
and
there
it
was
raised
and
they
affirmed.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
in
the
appellate
court,
your
honor,
the
district
attorney
confessed
error
there
was
no
problem.
of
course
he
argued
instead
that
the
search
can
only
be
sustained
under
section
180
of
the
code
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
he
argued
that
and
it's
clear
from
the
dissenting
opinions
of
justice
van
voorhis
and
justice
fuld
that
no
one,
everyone
is
in
the
agreement
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
in
this
case.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
they
go
much
further
they
said
there
wasn't
even
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
kalman
finkel
that
they're
willing
to
say
that
there
was
even
reasonable
suspicion
in
this
case.
with
respect
your
honors
to
the
power
to
search
under
this
statute
it
is
no
longer
open
question
that
the
word
search
in
this
statute
means
search.
in
people
v.
taggart
where
the
court
of
appeals
summed
up
what
they
had
said
in
all
the
other
previous
cases,
they
said
that
what
occurred
in
pugach,
what
occurred
in
taggart,
what
occurred
in
sibron
were
oral
searches
and
not
frisks.
they've
gone
far
beyond
that
limited
pre-statutory
holding
in
rivera
with
a
limited
search
to
a
frisk,
a
patting
of
the
outer
clothing.
here
they
say
that
they
are
talking
about
search
and
they
mean
search.
so
what
emerges
your
honor
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
the
policeman
is
quite
simple.
they
have
the
same
powers
that
they
ordinarily
would
only
have
under
probably
cause,
the
power
to
cease
someone
and
the
power
to
search
for
evidence
and
introduce
that
evidence
whatever
they
found,
whether
gun
or
any
other
put
into
criminal
prosecution
on
a
standard
of
less
than
probable
cause.
now
your
honor
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
standard.
the
standard
is
reasonable
suspicion.
reasonable
suspicion
is
used
in
two
separate
contexts
with
the
same
definition;
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
a
crime
is
or
will
be
committed
and
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
the
officer
is
in
danger
of
life
or
limb.
the
court
of
appeals
has
defined
reasonable
suspicion
as
follows
and
i
quote
from
the
peter's
opinion,
“probably
cause
requires
satisfactory
grounds
for
believing
that
a
crime
was
committed
while
reasonable
suspicion
requires
satisfactory
grounds
for
suspecting
that
a
crime
was
committed.”
the
difference
between
these
two
standards
is
proportionate
to
the
difference
and
degree
of
invasion
between
an
arrest
and
a
detention
between
a
full
search
and
a
frisk.
the
court
went
on
to
state
that
the
standard
incorporates
“the
experienced
police
officer
intuitive
knowledge
and
appraisal
of
appearances
of
criminal
activity.
his
evaluation
of
the
various
factors
involve,
ensures
a
protective
as
well
as
definitive
standing.”
your
honors,
one
is
immediately
struck
by
two
aspects
in
this
quote.
number
one,
the
court
of
appeals
in
taggart,
a
subsequent
decision
acknowledged
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
a
full
search
and
a
frisk.
they
have
acknowledged
that
this
statute
gives
the
right
to
search.
secondly
with
rather
striking
your
honor
is
the
fact
that
it
is
the
officer's
evaluation,
his
intuitive
knowledge
that
has
given
primary
emphasis,
very
subjective
and
i
say
your
honors
let
us
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
now
we
can
see
how
subjective
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
is.
in
this
case
basically
the
most
that
the
officer
heard
was
or
most
of
the
officer
observed
was
not
overheard
conversation
between
appellant,
a
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
and
various
drug
addicts.
yet
the
court
was
willing
to
say
that
that
was
reasonable
suspicion,
the
officers
there
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
appellant
is
committing
a
crime.
you
don't
have
to
prophesize
to
be
able
to
do
that
in
any
case
where
the
officer
was
so
and
has
a
record,
where
he
has
information
or
where
he
knows
he
is
a
drug
addict
any
of
these
people,
if
they
are
sitting
in
a
restaurant
of
course
the
officer
would
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
remove
those
people
from
the
restaurant
on
to
the
street.
likewise
your
honor
in
rivera
great
reliance
is
placed
on
high
crime
rate
and
the
lateness
of
the
evening.
in
that
case
your
honor
anyone
walking
down
the
street
late
at
night
is
possibly
reasonably
suspect.
now
the
district
attorney
says,
agreed
that
in
this
particular
case
the
officer
did
not
have
reasonable
suspicion.
however,
he
does
say
one
thing.
he
says
the
court
of
appeals
in
taggart
had
second
thoughts
about
this
case
and
it
had
this
case
come
to
the
court
subsequent
to
taggart,
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
reversed
this
decision.
your
honor,
with
all
due
difference
to
mr.
siegel
this
procedure
he
has
completely
misread
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
taggart
case.
number
one
in
taggart,
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
that
sibron
was
a
case
involving
reasonable
suspicion
and
adopted
the
reasoning
of
that
case.
the
district
attorney
on
page
46
of
his
brief
relies
on
this
court
from
the
court's
opinion
in
taggart
to
sustain
his
proposition,
“needless
to
add
the
serious
problem
is
suggested
only
in
cases
involving
serious
personal
injury
or
grave
irreparable
property
damage
and
not
by
the
problems
associated
with
the
enforcement
of
certiorari
laws
such
as
narcotics
violation.”
however,
the
district
attorney
forgot
to
read
the
previous
paragraph
which
states,
“there
are
exigencies
affecting
life,
limb,
or
great
property
damage
in
which
the
police
receive
information
of
crime
and
not
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause,
but
on
which
they
must
act.
but
the
court
of
appeals
meant
in
taggart
your
honor
quite
simply
is
this.
where
the
police
receive
an
anonymous
phone
call
that
a
man
is
engaged
in
violating
the
narcotics
law,
they
can
go
over
to
him
and
immediately
grab
him
by
the
arm
and
search
him.
however
where
they
receive
a
anonymous
information
that
a
man
has
a
gun
in
his
pocket,
they
can't
do
that,
but
nowhere
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
taggart
intimate
that
what
the
officer
observed
in
this
case
the
non-overheard
conversation
between
sibron
and
these
known
drug
addicts
was
something
less
that
probable
cause.
your
honors,
i
am
going
to
conclude
my
part
of
the
argument
with,
i
think
i've
attempted
to
show
where
this
statue
is
vulnerable
to
constitutional
attack
on
many
grounds
and
i
am
leaving
your
honor
for
mrs.
oberman
will
discuss
what
i
consider
the
great
vice
of
this
statue
and
that
is
with
the
second
context
of
reasonable
suspicion,
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
the
officer
is
in
danger
of
life
or
limb.
there
your
honor,
i
just
want
to
briefly
state
that
we
maintain
that
there
was
a
--
it
is
a
total
judicial
adjudication
to
the
judgment
of
the
police,
thank
you.
