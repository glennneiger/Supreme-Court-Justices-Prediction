ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
find
myself
with
even
less
to
say
than
mr.
finkel
if
the
district
attorney's
concession
in
this
case
disposes
of
it
altogether,
but
i
don't
think
the
case
is
that
simple.
first
of
all
we
have
two
prongs
of
attack
in
our
brief.
we
argue
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
we
have
also
argued
that
the
statute
has
become
unconstitutional
or
is
unconstitutional
insofar
as
has
been
applied
to
this
case.
now
the
district
attorney's
consent
goes
only
for
the
second
point.
so
that
if
this
court
were
to
decided
that
this
statute
is
constitutional
then
what
this
court
be
prepared
to
say
that
new
york
has
misinterpreted
its
own
statute.
who
speaks
better
for
new
york
state
as
to
what
situations
this
statute
applies
to?
the
district
attorney
for
kings
county
who
is
one
district
attorney
for
one
county
or
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
how
can
this
--?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
he
said
it
in
the
newspaper
but
that's,
i
think
but
that's
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
not
that
i
am
really
aware
of.
we
have
--
am
i
wrong.
well
perhaps
mr.
siegel
has
better
answer
because
so
far
as
motion
for
re-argument--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
motion
for
re-argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
suppose
he
couldn't
have
made
that?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
that's
true
your
honor
but
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
still
if
we
were
to
rest
solely
on
the
district
attorney
concession
that
the
statue
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
i
think
that
we
run
a
great
risk
because
if
the
court
ultimately
holds
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
then
you
could
disagree
with
the
district
attorney
because
i
recall
that
in
one
decision
this
court
said
that
criminal
law
can't
be
made
upon
the
stipulations
of
the
parties,
that
the
court
has
to
make
an
independent
appraisal
and
--
determination.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
in
fact
i
have
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
–
very
little
to
say
here
your
honor
if
nothing
else,
i
would
rest
on
the
fact
that
this
case
has
been
called
a
run-of-the-mill
case
and
for
that
reason
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
hear
argument
in
terms
of
a
run-of-the-mill
case,
because
i
really
do
believe
that
this
is
the
sort
of
case,
the
statute
is
aimed
at.
now
in
speaking
about
the
statute
i
would
like
to
highlight
very
briefly
some
of
the
major
difficulties
that
we
have
found
with
section
188.
first
of
all
there
is
a
variance
between
the
face
the
statute,
the
words
of
the
court
decisions
and
the
facts
of
the
cases.
so
that
in
order
to
determine
what
the
statute
permits
the
police
to
do,
you
have
to
look
at
it
simultaneously
on
three
levels.
what
does
a
statute
say,
what
does
the
court
say
and
what
does
the
conduct
and
those
three
levels
never
come
together
unless
you
are
willing
to
take
a
step
through
the
looking
glass
into
that
lonely
never,
never
land
where
as
humpty
dumpty
said,
when
i
use
the
word
it
means
what
i
choose
it
to
mean
no
more
no
less.
i
think
that
this
is
very
apparent
when
you
look
at
the
statute
and
see
the
variance
between
stop,
explanation
of
actions
the
face
of
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
this
is
the
limited
intrusion
of
asking
one
for
an
explanation
to
his
actions
and
then
what
the
policeman
have
done
in
making
this
stop
limited
intrusion.
in
peters,
the
companion
case
to
this
one
the
policeman
to
make
this
limited
intrusion
took
the
defendant
by
the
shirt
collar
and
pointed
a
gun
against
his
stomach.
that
was
the
limited
intrusion
of
asking
one
for
an
explanation
of
his
actions.
this
statute
creates
virtually
a
never,
never
land
where
if
you
look
at
it
just
on
the
level
of
what
it
purports
to
be
without
looking
how
it
operates
in
the
world,
you
can't,
you
can't
get
any
meaning
from
it
and
perhaps
this
is
why
in
terms
of
the
statute
like
this
you
can't
look
at
the
face
merely
without
looking
into
decisions
and
why
you
couldn't
look
at
the
face
of
the
statute
without
looking
at
sibron.
the
second
problem
as
mr.
finkel
has
pointed
out
is
what
does
the
standard
mean?
when
does
the
statute
permit
the
police
to
exercise
the
powers
that
it
gives
them
and
i
think
that
we
have
shown
you
in
our
brief
that
the
statute
curtails
the
policeman's
power
or
the
standard
curtails
the
policeman's
power
only
when
the
citizen's
conduct
is
perfectly
normal.
it
sets
up
a
range
that
can
trigger
police
conduct
or
a
range
of
citizen
action
that
can
trigger
police
conduct.
anything
less
than
certainty,
until
perfectly
normal
because
when
you
look
at
the,
when
you
focus
upon
the
intuition
of
the
experienced
police
officer
and
upon
his
appraisal
of
the
appearances
of
criminality
then
anything
that's
not
perfectly
normal
is
reasonably
suspect.
the
third
major
difficulty
with
the
statute
is
that
it's
a
break
with
precedent
and
i
think
that
this
is
acknowledged
because
police
powers
in
the
area
of
criminal
law
enforcement
have
traditionally
--
of
this
sort
have
traditionally
been
only
granted
upon
probable
cause.
now
the
departure
from
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
we
are
talking
about
two
different
precedents
your
honor
because
yes
the
precedent
of
the
streets
supports
this
statute
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
there
is
a
precedent
in
the
constitution
and
that's
the
precedent
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
that's
the
precedent
that
has
been
broken
with.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
think
that
mapp
broke
with
that
precedent,
mapp
just
was
a
recognition
that
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
that,
no
that
rule
was
an
unrealistic
decision
that
you
couldn't
say
we
can
have
the
fourth
amendment
on
the
4th
of
july
when
the
orators
want
to
come
up
and
talk
about
it,
but
we
can
let
a
different
kind
of
precedent
develop
on
the
streets
that's
what
the
rule
permitted
and
if
mapp
broke
with
any
kind
of
precedent
then
it
broke
with
the
precedent
of
letting
morality
rein
in
the
halls
of
justice
and
police
practice
rein
in
the
streets
of
the
cities.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
know
how
that
stop
was
made.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
there
is
--
i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
that,
and
i
don't
think
that
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
first
of
all
this
statute
is
not
directed
to
kind
of
situation.
this
is
the
deceptive
labeling
part
of
the
statute.
they
might
say
that
its
directed
to
this
kind
of
situation
but
its
not
because
you
don't
need
a
statute
for
that.
what
the
statute,
the
power
of
the
statute
purports
to
give
to
the
policeman
or
does
give
to
the
policeman
in
that
kind
of
situation
is
after
the
policeman
says,
“excuse
me
sir,
what
is
your
name?”
and
the
man
doesn't
stop
or
then
the
policeman
can
collar
him
and
hold
him
and
then
say
again,
“what
is
your
name?”
it's
not
the
power
to
question
that
is
being
given
in
this
statute,
it's
the
power
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
not
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
not
physically
no,
but
there
was
a
submission
to
authority
in
the
sense
of
the
--
that
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
it
didn't
quite
happen
that
way
your
honor
because
sibron
was
in
a
restaurant
sitting
down
and
the
officer
goes
into
the
restaurant
and
says,
“come
outside
with
me.”
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
if
sibron
had
just
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
think
that
he
could
under
this
statute.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
in
the
peters
case
for
instance
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
i
think
you
can't
talk
about
the
statute
without
talking
about
the
cases
because
the
words
don't
mean
anything
in
the
statute
unless
you
are
willing
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
maybe
one
of
the
reasons
that
ought
to
be
declared
unconstitutional
is
when
you
look
at
it
nobody
can
tell
what
it
means.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
for
the
district
attorney
your
honor
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
believe
the
on
reflection
the
second
reason
that
there
was
not
reasonable
suspicion
either
to
think
that
the
man
was
about
to
committing,
have
committed
a
crime
and
that
the
movement
towards
the
pocket
wasn't
a
--
didn't
rise
to
the
level
of
reasonable
suspicion
of
danger,
but
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
did.
we
didn't
put
anything
over
on
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
we
argued
this
very
thing
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
if
you
are
going
to
hold
this
statute
constitutional,
then
do
not
apply
it
to
this
case
because
talking
to
narcotics
addicts
cannot
be
reasonably
suspect,
it
just
can't
be
reasonably
suspect
conduct
and
reaching
the
hand
into
one's
pocket
in
response
to
an
officer
saying,
“you
know
what
i'm
looking
for,”
can't
be
--
can't
give
the
officer
reasonable
suspicion
that
he
is
in
danger
life
or
limb.
if
you
read
the
statute
this
way,
then
you
are
either
diluting
yourself
or
you're
trying
to
find
a
way
out
of
that.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no
your
honor,
i
think
with
all
deference
to
mr.
siegel,
who
has
my
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
--
respect,
he
has
said
this
is
not
the
taggart
decision.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
that's
his
suggestion,
but
i
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
i
don't
think
that
that's
correct
and
the
reason
is
that
taggart
was
a
particular
set
of
circumstances.
taggart
involved
an
anonymous
phone
call.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
oh
we
want
you
to
pay
attention
to
taggart
your
honor,
because
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
none
that
i'm
aware
of.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
peters
and
sibron
came
together.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
then
only
taggart
after
that,
but
yet
in
taggart
the
court
of
appeals
cites
sibron
for
the
purpose
that
in
the
non-anonymous
phone
call
situation,
where
the
officer
makes
street
observation,
that
the
street
observations
made
in
sibron
are
sufficient
to
give
him
reasonable
suspicion.
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
made
a
distinction
between
taggart
and
sibron.
an
anonymous
phone
call
might
not
be
enough
to
give
reasonable
suspicion
if
there
is
a
phone
call
saying
well
sibron
is
peddling
narcotics
on
such
and
such
a
corner,
but
if
the
officer
has
observed
sibron
doing
the
things
that
this
officer
observed
sibron
doing,
then
under
the
authority
of
sibron
he
can
act
pursuant
to
180
(a)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
now
when
i
had
talked
about
a
break
with
(inaudible),
the
break
becomes
very
apparent
when
you
look
at
the
justifications
that
the
proponents
of
the
statute
have
advanced
to
support
it.
i
mean,
everyone
is
in
agreement
that
if
this
were
a
statute,
on
its
face
authorizing
arrest,
search,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
but
they
say,
well
this
statute
authorizes
something
less
than
arrest
and
therefore
we
can
make
the
standard
something
less
than
probable
cause.
now
that's
wonderland,
because
unless
you're
willing
to
go
into
this
--
to
go
through
the
looking
glass
really
and
to
say
the
words
of
this
statute
mean
no
more,
no
less
than
these
words,
you
just
--
you
can't
accept
that
rationalization
because
what
happened
in
peters
was
not
less
than
an
arrest.
it
was
tantamount
to
an
arrest
and
then,
even
the
justification
that's
advanced
is
no
longer
support
for
the
such
part
of
the
statute,
because
before
taggart
at
any
rate,
the
depiction
was
relied
upon
in
the
language
of
the
cases
that
this
statute
authorized
something
less
than
a
search
even
though
on
it's
face
it
said
search,
it
authorized
a
frisk,
a
lesser
indignity
than
a
search.
but
in
taggart,
the
officer
conducted
a
search
and
to
find
authority
for
sustaining
that
activity,
the
court
of
appeals
went
back
to
all
its
prior
cases
and
said
in
all
of
those
cases,
expect
people
against
rivera,
what
the
officer
did
was
to
engage
in
the
search,
and
therefore
we
said
before
that
the
officer
--
if
we
sanctioned
those
searches
before,
we
can
sanction
those
searches
now.
so
that
this
lesser
than
rationale
just
doesn't
hold
water
analytically,
because
the
powers
that
the
statute
gives
are
not
lesser
than
the
traditional
powers,
they
are
the
same
powers
and
when
you
give
the
same
powers,
you
can't
give
them
on
a
lesser
standard.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no
the
fear
of
bodily
harm
comes
because
the
answer
to
any
question
maybe
a
bullet.
i
mean
even
though
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
of
what
has
to
be
done
first,
the
search
or
the
frisk?
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
much
difference
because
i
personally
would
much
rather
have
somebody
reach
into
my
pocket
and
take
something
out
of,
than
start
running
their
hands
from
my
neck
to
my
chest,
to
my
waist,
to
my
hips,
to
my
groin,
to
my
legs,
to
my
cuffs
and
that's
a
frisk.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that,
yes.
now
there
is
also
a
second
justification
that
is
advanced
for
this
statute,
recognizing
that
it
is
a
break
from
precedent
and
this
justification
runs
a
little
bit
different
course.
the
proponents
say
--
well
the
purpose
of
the
search
provision
of
this
statute
is
to
give
the
officer
a
right
to
protect
himself
and
therefore
if
you're
giving
merely
the
right
to
the
officer
to
protect
himself,
we
can
let
him
to
do
it
on
something
less
than
probable
cause.
well
this
rationalization
doesn't
hold
up
analytically
either,
because
the
statute
goes
beyond
this
protected
purpose,
permits
the
officer
to
seize
any
item
possessed
illegally
upon
the
person
of
the
individual
searched.
it
can
be
then
used
into
--
put
into
evidence
in
a
criminal
case.
so
the
statute
doesn't
only
have
a
protected
purpose,
it
has
a
two-fold
purpose,
protection
and
evidence
gathering.
once
you
go
on
beyond
merely
giving
the
officer
the
right
to
protect
himself,
and
give
him
the
right
to
gather
evidence,
then
this
is
a
search
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
evidence
and
you
can't
give
it
on
anything
less
than
probable
cause.
the
camara
case
or
the
cases
of
camara
and
see
are
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
connection
with
this
kind
of
rationalization.
but
they
just,
--
in
comparison
they
don't
holdup
because
this
statute
goes
beyond
protection.
it
really
employs
an
overkill
in
reaching
its
target.
if
you
wanted
to
let
a
police
officer
protect
himself
in
those
situations
where
he
is
in
heart
felt
need
of
self-protection,
you
could
let
him
make
the
search
or
the
frisk
or
whatever
and
say
he
won't
be
prosecuted,
civilly
he
won't
reprimanded
administratively
but
don't
have
to
--
but
you
can't
then
say
just
because
he
made
it
for
self-protection
you
have
to
let
the
evidence
come
in.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
statute
says
that
the
officer
can
stop
him
and
demand
an
explanation
of
his
–
his
name,
address
and
an
explanation
of
his
actions.
now,
demand
is
a
different
palaver
of
word.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
not
this
statute
your
honor.
but
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes
your
honor
because
now
we
have
a
new
statute
that's
a
loitering
statute,
which
after
september
1,
1967
makes
it
a
crime
for
anyone
to
fail
to
give
a
reasonable
explanation
to
an
officer
who
stops
him
and
we
have
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
not
under
this
statute
but
there
have
been
prosecutions
under
this
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the,
so
far
as
the
stop
provision
of
the
statute,
there
is,
no
–
well,
it's
fairly
unclear
because
it
really
hasn't
been
construed
yet.
there
are
problems
that's
in
here,
in
the
very
fabric
of
it
but
the
search
provision
of
the
statute
and
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
before
was
it
when
you
look
at
the
search,
it's
not
merely
a
protective
search
because
it
also
in
permitting
the
officer
to
gather
any
evidence
he
finds
upon
the
body
of
the
individual
he
is
protecting
himself
against
and
taking
that
evidence
and
giving
it
to
the
prosecution
can
use
in
a
criminal
case,
the
statute
also
affirmatively
authorizes
the
officer
to
get
to
engage
in
evidence
gathering.
this
kind
of
activity,
this
kind
of
power
has
never
been
given
heretofore
without
probable
cause.
so
that
in
that
aspect
on
it
face,
the
statute
i
think
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
that
they
raise
exactly
the
same
constitutional
problem.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor,
this
not
gun
control
legislation.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
the
officer;
it's
not
a
question
of
protecting
the
community.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
your
honor
and
this
is
what
judge
van
voorhis
on
our
court
of
appeals
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
there
must
–
sure
it
is
and
justice
van
voorhis
who
dissented
in
our
case,
dissented
just
exactly
on
this
rationalization.
we
are
letting
the
police
officer
do
things
in
his
almost
unlimited
discretion
said
judge
van
voorhis
let's
confine
it
to
the
situation
involving
a
gun
and
not
get
into
these
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
still
i
maintain
that
when
you
permit
attacked
gun
to
be
used
as
evidence,
you're
no
longer
authorizing
by
statute
merely
a
protective
search.
you're
authorizing
a
protective
search
and
an
evidence
gathering
search
and
that
once
you
authorize
an
evidence
gathering
search,
the
standard
has
to
be
probable
cause.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
we
unhinge
the
exclusionary
rule
from
the
fourth
amendment
in
other
kinds
of
situations
too
because
there
are
some
illegal
searches
and
seizures
that
result
in
the
production
of
evidence
that
--
where
this
court
doesn't
exclude
evidence
because
the
person
had
--
complaining
has
no
standard
to
complain.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
we're
unhinging
it
in
a
different
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
we
say
it's
not
unreasonable
in
the
terms
of
the
heart.
it's
not
unreasonable
in
the
terms
of
the
instinct.
but
it's
unreasonable
in
the
terms
of
the
constitution,
because
unreasonable
in
that
context
is
a
constitutional
word
of
heart
that
has
meant
a
search
upon
probable
cause.
the
only
search
that
is
reasonable,
the
only
search
resulting
in
evidence
that
can
be
introduced
in
a
criminal
prosecution
that
is
reasonable
is
a
search
made
upon
probable
cause.
i
think
that
i
have
exhausted
my
time.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
mr.
chief
justice
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
speak
to
the
question
of
mootness
which
was
not
raised
at
any
stage
of
this
case
before
yesterday.
i
have
a
minute
and
40
seconds
left
and
i
have
a
minute
and
40
seconds
argument
prepared.
jurisdiction
was
noted
in
this
case
before
this
court's
decisions
in
jacobs
and
tenenbaum
against
new
york
and
before
this
court's
decision
in
see
against
seattle.
in
all
these
cases
there
were
suspended
fines
or
non-felony
sentences
which
could
not
be
executed
at
a
later
date.
under
jacobs
and
tenenbaum,
sibron
is
moot,
under
see
against
seattle
it
is
not.
the
problem
of
mootness
is
of
particular
concern
in
new
york
where
it's
virtually
impossible
for
an
appellant
in
new
york
to
obtain
bail
pending
appeal
and
thus
preserve
this
case
for
federal
review.
moreover,
under
section
555
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
bail
on
appeal
is
prohibited
to
one
situated
as
well
as
sibron.
this
court
should
reconsider
jacobs
and
tenenbaum
or
at
least
limit
them
to
cases
that
did
not
become
moot
because
of
the
petitioner's
indigence
or
because
of
the
state's
limitation
upon
the
right
to
bail
pending
appeal.
the
confession
of
error
in
this
case
points
up
the
weakness
of
the
jacobs
and
tenenbaum
rule.
sibron
is
a
case
concededly
wrongly
decided
which
if
dismissed
will
never
be
set
right.
on
the
district
attorney's
concession,
we
have
stated
that
our
only
interest
as
advocate
for
sibron
is
to
obtain
making
sure
of
his
conviction.
our
response
to
questioning
yesterday
stems
from
our
doubt
as
to
this
court's
power
to
except
one
district
attorney's
concession
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
erred
not
once
but
twice
in
holding
that
it's
own
statute
applied
to
this
case
and
also
from
our
conviction
that
the
non-bailable
petty
offenders
of
new
york
should
be
able
to
rely
not
only
on
the
conscience
of
one
man
in
a
busy
district
attorney's
office
to
see
that
they
get
justice,
but
on
the
entire
judicial
system
of
the
state
of
new
york
especially
where
the
consent
is
not
upon
the
new
york
courts
within
its
own
court
system.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
may
we
file
a
brief
on
mootness,
your
honor?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
thank
you.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
thank
you
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
thank
you
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
find
myself
with
even
less
to
say
than
mr.
finkel
if
the
district
attorney's
concession
in
this
case
disposes
of
it
altogether,
but
i
don't
think
the
case
is
that
simple.
first
of
all
we
have
two
prongs
of
attack
in
our
brief.
we
argue
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
we
have
also
argued
that
the
statute
has
become
unconstitutional
or
is
unconstitutional
insofar
as
has
been
applied
to
this
case.
now
the
district
attorney's
consent
goes
only
for
the
second
point.
so
that
if
this
court
were
to
decided
that
this
statute
is
constitutional
then
what
this
court
be
prepared
to
say
that
new
york
has
misinterpreted
its
own
statute.
who
speaks
better
for
new
york
state
as
to
what
situations
this
statute
applies
to?
the
district
attorney
for
kings
county
who
is
one
district
attorney
for
one
county
or
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
how
can
this
--?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
he
said
it
in
the
newspaper
but
that's,
i
think
but
that's
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
not
that
i
am
really
aware
of.
we
have
--
am
i
wrong.
well
perhaps
mr.
siegel
has
better
answer
because
so
far
as
motion
for
re-argument--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
motion
for
re-argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
suppose
he
couldn't
have
made
that?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
that's
true
your
honor
but
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
still
if
we
were
to
rest
solely
on
the
district
attorney
concession
that
the
statue
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
i
think
that
we
run
a
great
risk
because
if
the
court
ultimately
holds
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
then
you
could
disagree
with
the
district
attorney
because
i
recall
that
in
one
decision
this
court
said
that
criminal
law
can't
be
made
upon
the
stipulations
of
the
parties,
that
the
court
has
to
make
an
independent
appraisal
and
--
determination.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
in
fact
i
have
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
–
very
little
to
say
here
your
honor
if
nothing
else,
i
would
rest
on
the
fact
that
this
case
has
been
called
a
run-of-the-mill
case
and
for
that
reason
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
hear
argument
in
terms
of
a
run-of-the-mill
case,
because
i
really
do
believe
that
this
is
the
sort
of
case,
the
statute
is
aimed
at.
now
in
speaking
about
the
statute
i
would
like
to
highlight
very
briefly
some
of
the
major
difficulties
that
we
have
found
with
section
188.
first
of
all
there
is
a
variance
between
the
face
the
statute,
the
words
of
the
court
decisions
and
the
facts
of
the
cases.
so
that
in
order
to
determine
what
the
statute
permits
the
police
to
do,
you
have
to
look
at
it
simultaneously
on
three
levels.
what
does
a
statute
say,
what
does
the
court
say
and
what
does
the
conduct
and
those
three
levels
never
come
together
unless
you
are
willing
to
take
a
step
through
the
looking
glass
into
that
lonely
never,
never
land
where
as
humpty
dumpty
said,
when
i
use
the
word
it
means
what
i
choose
it
to
mean
no
more
no
less.
i
think
that
this
is
very
apparent
when
you
look
at
the
statute
and
see
the
variance
between
stop,
explanation
of
actions
the
face
of
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
this
is
the
limited
intrusion
of
asking
one
for
an
explanation
to
his
actions
and
then
what
the
policeman
have
done
in
making
this
stop
limited
intrusion.
in
peters,
the
companion
case
to
this
one
the
policeman
to
make
this
limited
intrusion
took
the
defendant
by
the
shirt
collar
and
pointed
a
gun
against
his
stomach.
that
was
the
limited
intrusion
of
asking
one
for
an
explanation
of
his
actions.
this
statute
creates
virtually
a
never,
never
land
where
if
you
look
at
it
just
on
the
level
of
what
it
purports
to
be
without
looking
how
it
operates
in
the
world,
you
can't,
you
can't
get
any
meaning
from
it
and
perhaps
this
is
why
in
terms
of
the
statute
like
this
you
can't
look
at
the
face
merely
without
looking
into
decisions
and
why
you
couldn't
look
at
the
face
of
the
statute
without
looking
at
sibron.
the
second
problem
as
mr.
finkel
has
pointed
out
is
what
does
the
standard
mean?
when
does
the
statute
permit
the
police
to
exercise
the
powers
that
it
gives
them
and
i
think
that
we
have
shown
you
in
our
brief
that
the
statute
curtails
the
policeman's
power
or
the
standard
curtails
the
policeman's
power
only
when
the
citizen's
conduct
is
perfectly
normal.
it
sets
up
a
range
that
can
trigger
police
conduct
or
a
range
of
citizen
action
that
can
trigger
police
conduct.
anything
less
than
certainty,
until
perfectly
normal
because
when
you
look
at
the,
when
you
focus
upon
the
intuition
of
the
experienced
police
officer
and
upon
his
appraisal
of
the
appearances
of
criminality
then
anything
that's
not
perfectly
normal
is
reasonably
suspect.
the
third
major
difficulty
with
the
statute
is
that
it's
a
break
with
precedent
and
i
think
that
this
is
acknowledged
because
police
powers
in
the
area
of
criminal
law
enforcement
have
traditionally
--
of
this
sort
have
traditionally
been
only
granted
upon
probable
cause.
now
the
departure
from
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
we
are
talking
about
two
different
precedents
your
honor
because
yes
the
precedent
of
the
streets
supports
this
statute
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
there
is
a
precedent
in
the
constitution
and
that's
the
precedent
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
that's
the
precedent
that
has
been
broken
with.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
think
that
mapp
broke
with
that
precedent,
mapp
just
was
a
recognition
that
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
that,
no
that
rule
was
an
unrealistic
decision
that
you
couldn't
say
we
can
have
the
fourth
amendment
on
the
4th
of
july
when
the
orators
want
to
come
up
and
talk
about
it,
but
we
can
let
a
different
kind
of
precedent
develop
on
the
streets
that's
what
the
rule
permitted
and
if
mapp
broke
with
any
kind
of
precedent
then
it
broke
with
the
precedent
of
letting
morality
rein
in
the
halls
of
justice
and
police
practice
rein
in
the
streets
of
the
cities.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
know
how
that
stop
was
made.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
there
is
--
i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
that,
and
i
don't
think
that
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
first
of
all
this
statute
is
not
directed
to
kind
of
situation.
this
is
the
deceptive
labeling
part
of
the
statute.
they
might
say
that
its
directed
to
this
kind
of
situation
but
its
not
because
you
don't
need
a
statute
for
that.
what
the
statute,
the
power
of
the
statute
purports
to
give
to
the
policeman
or
does
give
to
the
policeman
in
that
kind
of
situation
is
after
the
policeman
says,
“excuse
me
sir,
what
is
your
name?”
and
the
man
doesn't
stop
or
then
the
policeman
can
collar
him
and
hold
him
and
then
say
again,
“what
is
your
name?”
it's
not
the
power
to
question
that
is
being
given
in
this
statute,
it's
the
power
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
not
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
not
physically
no,
but
there
was
a
submission
to
authority
in
the
sense
of
the
--
that
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
it
didn't
quite
happen
that
way
your
honor
because
sibron
was
in
a
restaurant
sitting
down
and
the
officer
goes
into
the
restaurant
and
says,
“come
outside
with
me.”
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
if
sibron
had
just
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
think
that
he
could
under
this
statute.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
in
the
peters
case
for
instance
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
i
think
you
can't
talk
about
the
statute
without
talking
about
the
cases
because
the
words
don't
mean
anything
in
the
statute
unless
you
are
willing
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
maybe
one
of
the
reasons
that
ought
to
be
declared
unconstitutional
is
when
you
look
at
it
nobody
can
tell
what
it
means.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
for
the
district
attorney
your
honor
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
believe
the
on
reflection
the
second
reason
that
there
was
not
reasonable
suspicion
either
to
think
that
the
man
was
about
to
committing,
have
committed
a
crime
and
that
the
movement
towards
the
pocket
wasn't
a
--
didn't
rise
to
the
level
of
reasonable
suspicion
of
danger,
but
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
did.
we
didn't
put
anything
over
on
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
we
argued
this
very
thing
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
if
you
are
going
to
hold
this
statute
constitutional,
then
do
not
apply
it
to
this
case
because
talking
to
narcotics
addicts
cannot
be
reasonably
suspect,
it
just
can't
be
reasonably
suspect
conduct
and
reaching
the
hand
into
one's
pocket
in
response
to
an
officer
saying,
“you
know
what
i'm
looking
for,”
can't
be
--
can't
give
the
officer
reasonable
suspicion
that
he
is
in
danger
life
or
limb.
if
you
read
the
statute
this
way,
then
you
are
either
diluting
yourself
or
you're
trying
to
find
a
way
out
of
that.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no
your
honor,
i
think
with
all
deference
to
mr.
siegel,
who
has
my
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
--
respect,
he
has
said
this
is
not
the
taggart
decision.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
that's
his
suggestion,
but
i
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
i
don't
think
that
that's
correct
and
the
reason
is
that
taggart
was
a
particular
set
of
circumstances.
taggart
involved
an
anonymous
phone
call.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
oh
we
want
you
to
pay
attention
to
taggart
your
honor,
because
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
none
that
i'm
aware
of.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
peters
and
sibron
came
together.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
then
only
taggart
after
that,
but
yet
in
taggart
the
court
of
appeals
cites
sibron
for
the
purpose
that
in
the
non-anonymous
phone
call
situation,
where
the
officer
makes
street
observation,
that
the
street
observations
made
in
sibron
are
sufficient
to
give
him
reasonable
suspicion.
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
made
a
distinction
between
taggart
and
sibron.
an
anonymous
phone
call
might
not
be
enough
to
give
reasonable
suspicion
if
there
is
a
phone
call
saying
well
sibron
is
peddling
narcotics
on
such
and
such
a
corner,
but
if
the
officer
has
observed
sibron
doing
the
things
that
this
officer
observed
sibron
doing,
then
under
the
authority
of
sibron
he
can
act
pursuant
to
180
(a)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
now
when
i
had
talked
about
a
break
with
(inaudible),
the
break
becomes
very
apparent
when
you
look
at
the
justifications
that
the
proponents
of
the
statute
have
advanced
to
support
it.
i
mean,
everyone
is
in
agreement
that
if
this
were
a
statute,
on
its
face
authorizing
arrest,
search,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
but
they
say,
well
this
statute
authorizes
something
less
than
arrest
and
therefore
we
can
make
the
standard
something
less
than
probable
cause.
now
that's
wonderland,
because
unless
you're
willing
to
go
into
this
--
to
go
through
the
looking
glass
really
and
to
say
the
words
of
this
statute
mean
no
more,
no
less
than
these
words,
you
just
--
you
can't
accept
that
rationalization
because
what
happened
in
peters
was
not
less
than
an
arrest.
it
was
tantamount
to
an
arrest
and
then,
even
the
justification
that's
advanced
is
no
longer
support
for
the
such
part
of
the
statute,
because
before
taggart
at
any
rate,
the
depiction
was
relied
upon
in
the
language
of
the
cases
that
this
statute
authorized
something
less
than
a
search
even
though
on
it's
face
it
said
search,
it
authorized
a
frisk,
a
lesser
indignity
than
a
search.
but
in
taggart,
the
officer
conducted
a
search
and
to
find
authority
for
sustaining
that
activity,
the
court
of
appeals
went
back
to
all
its
prior
cases
and
said
in
all
of
those
cases,
expect
people
against
rivera,
what
the
officer
did
was
to
engage
in
the
search,
and
therefore
we
said
before
that
the
officer
--
if
we
sanctioned
those
searches
before,
we
can
sanction
those
searches
now.
so
that
this
lesser
than
rationale
just
doesn't
hold
water
analytically,
because
the
powers
that
the
statute
gives
are
not
lesser
than
the
traditional
powers,
they
are
the
same
powers
and
when
you
give
the
same
powers,
you
can't
give
them
on
a
lesser
standard.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no
the
fear
of
bodily
harm
comes
because
the
answer
to
any
question
maybe
a
bullet.
i
mean
even
though
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
of
what
has
to
be
done
first,
the
search
or
the
frisk?
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
much
difference
because
i
personally
would
much
rather
have
somebody
reach
into
my
pocket
and
take
something
out
of,
than
start
running
their
hands
from
my
neck
to
my
chest,
to
my
waist,
to
my
hips,
to
my
groin,
to
my
legs,
to
my
cuffs
and
that's
a
frisk.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that,
yes.
now
there
is
also
a
second
justification
that
is
advanced
for
this
statute,
recognizing
that
it
is
a
break
from
precedent
and
this
justification
runs
a
little
bit
different
course.
the
proponents
say
--
well
the
purpose
of
the
search
provision
of
this
statute
is
to
give
the
officer
a
right
to
protect
himself
and
therefore
if
you're
giving
merely
the
right
to
the
officer
to
protect
himself,
we
can
let
him
to
do
it
on
something
less
than
probable
cause.
well
this
rationalization
doesn't
hold
up
analytically
either,
because
the
statute
goes
beyond
this
protected
purpose,
permits
the
officer
to
seize
any
item
possessed
illegally
upon
the
person
of
the
individual
searched.
it
can
be
then
used
into
--
put
into
evidence
in
a
criminal
case.
so
the
statute
doesn't
only
have
a
protected
purpose,
it
has
a
two-fold
purpose,
protection
and
evidence
gathering.
once
you
go
on
beyond
merely
giving
the
officer
the
right
to
protect
himself,
and
give
him
the
right
to
gather
evidence,
then
this
is
a
search
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
evidence
and
you
can't
give
it
on
anything
less
than
probable
cause.
the
camara
case
or
the
cases
of
camara
and
see
are
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
connection
with
this
kind
of
rationalization.
but
they
just,
--
in
comparison
they
don't
holdup
because
this
statute
goes
beyond
protection.
it
really
employs
an
overkill
in
reaching
its
target.
if
you
wanted
to
let
a
police
officer
protect
himself
in
those
situations
where
he
is
in
heart
felt
need
of
self-protection,
you
could
let
him
make
the
search
or
the
frisk
or
whatever
and
say
he
won't
be
prosecuted,
civilly
he
won't
reprimanded
administratively
but
don't
have
to
--
but
you
can't
then
say
just
because
he
made
it
for
self-protection
you
have
to
let
the
evidence
come
in.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
statute
says
that
the
officer
can
stop
him
and
demand
an
explanation
of
his
–
his
name,
address
and
an
explanation
of
his
actions.
now,
demand
is
a
different
palaver
of
word.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
not
this
statute
your
honor.
but
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes
your
honor
because
now
we
have
a
new
statute
that's
a
loitering
statute,
which
after
september
1,
1967
makes
it
a
crime
for
anyone
to
fail
to
give
a
reasonable
explanation
to
an
officer
who
stops
him
and
we
have
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
not
under
this
statute
but
there
have
been
prosecutions
under
this
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the,
so
far
as
the
stop
provision
of
the
statute,
there
is,
no
–
well,
it's
fairly
unclear
because
it
really
hasn't
been
construed
yet.
there
are
problems
that's
in
here,
in
the
very
fabric
of
it
but
the
search
provision
of
the
statute
and
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
before
was
it
when
you
look
at
the
search,
it's
not
merely
a
protective
search
because
it
also
in
permitting
the
officer
to
gather
any
evidence
he
finds
upon
the
body
of
the
individual
he
is
protecting
himself
against
and
taking
that
evidence
and
giving
it
to
the
prosecution
can
use
in
a
criminal
case,
the
statute
also
affirmatively
authorizes
the
officer
to
get
to
engage
in
evidence
gathering.
this
kind
of
activity,
this
kind
of
power
has
never
been
given
heretofore
without
probable
cause.
so
that
in
that
aspect
on
it
face,
the
statute
i
think
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
that
they
raise
exactly
the
same
constitutional
problem.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor,
this
not
gun
control
legislation.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
the
officer;
it's
not
a
question
of
protecting
the
community.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
your
honor
and
this
is
what
judge
van
voorhis
on
our
court
of
appeals
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
there
must
–
sure
it
is
and
justice
van
voorhis
who
dissented
in
our
case,
dissented
just
exactly
on
this
rationalization.
we
are
letting
the
police
officer
do
things
in
his
almost
unlimited
discretion
said
judge
van
voorhis
let's
confine
it
to
the
situation
involving
a
gun
and
not
get
into
these
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
still
i
maintain
that
when
you
permit
attacked
gun
to
be
used
as
evidence,
you're
no
longer
authorizing
by
statute
merely
a
protective
search.
you're
authorizing
a
protective
search
and
an
evidence
gathering
search
and
that
once
you
authorize
an
evidence
gathering
search,
the
standard
has
to
be
probable
cause.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
we
unhinge
the
exclusionary
rule
from
the
fourth
amendment
in
other
kinds
of
situations
too
because
there
are
some
illegal
searches
and
seizures
that
result
in
the
production
of
evidence
that
--
where
this
court
doesn't
exclude
evidence
because
the
person
had
--
complaining
has
no
standard
to
complain.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
we're
unhinging
it
in
a
different
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
we
say
it's
not
unreasonable
in
the
terms
of
the
heart.
it's
not
unreasonable
in
the
terms
of
the
instinct.
but
it's
unreasonable
in
the
terms
of
the
constitution,
because
unreasonable
in
that
context
is
a
constitutional
word
of
heart
that
has
meant
a
search
upon
probable
cause.
the
only
search
that
is
reasonable,
the
only
search
resulting
in
evidence
that
can
be
introduced
in
a
criminal
prosecution
that
is
reasonable
is
a
search
made
upon
probable
cause.
i
think
that
i
have
exhausted
my
time.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
mr.
chief
justice
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
speak
to
the
question
of
mootness
which
was
not
raised
at
any
stage
of
this
case
before
yesterday.
i
have
a
minute
and
40
seconds
left
and
i
have
a
minute
and
40
seconds
argument
prepared.
jurisdiction
was
noted
in
this
case
before
this
court's
decisions
in
jacobs
and
tenenbaum
against
new
york
and
before
this
court's
decision
in
see
against
seattle.
in
all
these
cases
there
were
suspended
fines
or
non-felony
sentences
which
could
not
be
executed
at
a
later
date.
under
jacobs
and
tenenbaum,
sibron
is
moot,
under
see
against
seattle
it
is
not.
the
problem
of
mootness
is
of
particular
concern
in
new
york
where
it's
virtually
impossible
for
an
appellant
in
new
york
to
obtain
bail
pending
appeal
and
thus
preserve
this
case
for
federal
review.
moreover,
under
section
555
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
bail
on
appeal
is
prohibited
to
one
situated
as
well
as
sibron.
this
court
should
reconsider
jacobs
and
tenenbaum
or
at
least
limit
them
to
cases
that
did
not
become
moot
because
of
the
petitioner's
indigence
or
because
of
the
state's
limitation
upon
the
right
to
bail
pending
appeal.
the
confession
of
error
in
this
case
points
up
the
weakness
of
the
jacobs
and
tenenbaum
rule.
sibron
is
a
case
concededly
wrongly
decided
which
if
dismissed
will
never
be
set
right.
on
the
district
attorney's
concession,
we
have
stated
that
our
only
interest
as
advocate
for
sibron
is
to
obtain
making
sure
of
his
conviction.
our
response
to
questioning
yesterday
stems
from
our
doubt
as
to
this
court's
power
to
except
one
district
attorney's
concession
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
erred
not
once
but
twice
in
holding
that
it's
own
statute
applied
to
this
case
and
also
from
our
conviction
that
the
non-bailable
petty
offenders
of
new
york
should
be
able
to
rely
not
only
on
the
conscience
of
one
man
in
a
busy
district
attorney's
office
to
see
that
they
get
justice,
but
on
the
entire
judicial
system
of
the
state
of
new
york
especially
where
the
consent
is
not
upon
the
new
york
courts
within
its
own
court
system.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
may
we
file
a
brief
on
mootness,
your
honor?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
thank
you.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
thank
you
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman

your
