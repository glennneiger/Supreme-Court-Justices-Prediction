justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
practice,
this
isn't
break
of
the
precedent
is
it,
had
a
policeman
in
new
york
city
been
doing
those
kind
of
things
[inaudible]
and
the
question
never
really
arose
until
mapp
against
ohio,
because
new
york
did
not
have
a
exclusionary
rule
and
now
because
of
mapp
against
ohio
is
does
but
this
so
far
is
police
practices
in
a
big
city
are
concerned
this
statute
merely
reflects
the
precedent
of
trial
of
practical
conduct.
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
not
the
precedents
in
new
york,
because
new
york
didn't
have
an
exclusionary
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course,
we
are
concerned
with.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
mapp
against
ohio
broke
with
a
previous
constitutional
precedent
as
well,
i
wrote
against
colorado
precedents?
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
ruling?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
is
this
at
least
a
possible
argument
that
you
may
distinguish
two
cases
posed
to
you
by
my
brother
fortas.
the
only
justification
as
i
understand
it,
offered,
the
only
rational
justification
offered
for
the
granting
a
policeman
of
this
power
to
pat
down
or
frisk
somebody
is
for
a)
the
defense
of
the
policeman
himself
and
b)
i
suppose
the
defense
of
community
from
dangerous
people
armed
with
weapons,
isn't
that
correct?
is
that
the
rationale,
isn't
that
the
justification
offered
by
one
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
that
much
distinction
in
the
two
cases
to
put
to
you
by
mr.
justice
fortas?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
at
least
confine
it
to
the
only
justification
which
is
offered
in
support
of
this
law,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
said
don't
we
have
that
little
background,
the
reason
for
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
provide
a
sanction
and
a
sanction
that
the
court
concluded
experience
had
shown,
was
the
only
available
sanction
to
enforce
the
constitutional
right
of
the
people
to
be
secured
in
their
houses
[inaudible].
the
exclusionary
rule
didn't
come
first;
the
fourth
amendment
came
first
and
the
exclusionary
rule
came
as
a
sanction.
i
mean
now
you're
trying
to
make
reverse,
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
well
also
if
you
begin
with
the
--
if
you
say
that
at
least
to
the
extent
that
a
policeman
is
privileged
to
frisk
somebody
in
order
to
protect
that
policeman's
own
life,
then
by
definition,
by
hypothesis
then
this
is
not
unlawful
conduct
and
there
is
no
reason
for
any
exclusionary
rule
to
prevent
any
unlawful
conduct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
don't
understand
it.
why
it
wasn't
in
the
cards,
to
use
your
phrase,
for
you
to
make
a
position
on
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
if
he
had
called
the
police,
which
you
say
now
is
proper
from
to
do
then
the
police
would
had
come
and
what
could
they
have
done?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
all
they
saw
was
this
man
in
a
landing
and
that's
all
of
course
that
the
tenant
policeman
could
have
told
them,
and
the
police
under
your
theory
would
have
been
powerless
to
do
anything
after
they
came.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
fact
is
that
he
was
doing
something
illegal
by
having
in
his
possession
burglar's
tool
and
so
we're
not,
there's
not
point
hypothesizing
anything
about
it
because
we
know
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
this
man
hadn't
been
a
police
officer,
he
wasn't
a,
he
wasn't
a
mount
vernon
police
officer,
he
just
happened,
he
was
a
commuter,
he's
out
there
in
vernon
because
he
was
a
bank
clerk
in
new
york,
when
he
went
to
work
in
new
york
instead
he
was
off-duty,
he
was
a
tenant
in
an
apartment
in
the
city
of
mount
vernon
in
new
york
and
what
if
he
had
been
instead
of
policeman,
a
bank
clerk,
hadn't
had
redemption
of
the
bravery,
that's
why
it
takes
a
certain
amount
to
do
what
this
man
did
here,
happen
to
be
a
policeman
wouldn't,
that
would
have
been
a
perfectly
valid
citizen's
arrest
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
you're
in
the
shower
and
you
hear
your
apartment
burgled.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
would
have
been
very
able
to
defend
that
kind
of
against
any
charge
or
false
arrest,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
practice,
this
isn't
break
of
the

is
it,

a
