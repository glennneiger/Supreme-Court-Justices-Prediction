mr.
justice
bernnan
would
you
tell
me
mr.
finkel
--
i
know
that's
in
state
but
--
that
district
attorney
confessed
his
error
to
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
do
we
have
--
should
we
reach
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
and
face
that?
mr.
justice
bernnan
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
why,
why?
mr.
justice
bernnan
[inaudible]
ordinarily
the
confessions
of
errors
ordinarily
be
simply
released?
mr.
justice
bernnan
why
you
don't
want
to
reach
any
question
under
the
statute
at
all?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
this
may
all
be
true,
that
was
it,
but
why
should
we
do
--
deal
with
something
like
this
in
the
constitutional
area
when
the
question
of
error
--
conviction.
mr.
justice
bernnan
what
you
want
us
to
do
is
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
you
don't
care
how
he
comes
out
of
it?[laughter]
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
think
mrs.
oberman
is
there
is
a
procedure
by
which
after
the
affirmance
from
the
court
of
appeals,
district
attorney
could
have
gotten
somewhere
and
said
well
we
don't
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
and
wipe
of
the
slate?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
is
there
any
procedure
by
which
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
then
why
he
didn't
do
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan

–
but
you
can't
go
back
now
and
say
to
the
court
of
appeals
you
may
have
[inaudible]
conviction.
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
you
should
say
that,
you
have
to
come
and
ask
us
to
reverse
about
your
confession
of
error?
mr.
justice
bernnan
