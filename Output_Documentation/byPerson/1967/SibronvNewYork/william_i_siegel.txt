mr.
william
i.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice
–
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
develop
my
argument,
if
indeed
i
develop
an
argument;
one,
perhaps
two
and
maybe
three
preliminary
statements
which
i
want
to
make.
i
want
to
make
them
because
first
i
owe
them
to
the
court
and
secondly
i
want
to
make
them
as
a
sort
of
apologia
pro
vita
mia
in
this
case,
because
this
is
a
most
unusual
case
by
the
district
attorney
representing
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york,
comes
into
this
court
to
make
a
confession
of
error
on
the
part
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
mr.
justice
brennan
said
why
didn't
why
didn't
we
do
it
before
and
i
assure
you
that
i
find
it
personally
very
disagreeable
to
have
to
make
this
confession
of
error
before
this
tribunal,
because
i
have
the
highest
regard
for
the
judges
of
our
court
of
appeals.
i
sustain
a
friendly,
personal
relationship
with
some
of
them
and
if
it
had
been
in
the
cards,
so
to
speak,
for
me
to
have
done
it
in
albany
rather
than
in
washington,
i
would
have
been
most
pleased
to
do
so.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
know
of
no
procedure
which
would
have
enabled
me
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
what
i
am
(inaudible)
saying
to
this
court
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
correct,
and
i
don't
know
i
maybe
wrong.
in
this
case
i'm
in
the
unfortunate
predicament
of
finding
myself
in
disagreement
with
almost
everybody.
i
disagree
with
[laughter]
i
disagree
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
disagree
in
some
respects
with
mr.
juviler
to
whom
i
have
yielded
20
minutes
of
my
time,
as
amicus
representing
the
new
york
county
district
attorney.
most
regretfully
i
disagree
with
mrs.
oberman,
whose
scholarship
is
equaled
only
by
her
charm
and
beauty.
i
am
sorry
that
in
this
instance
she
seems
to
remember
her
latin
much
better
than
she
does
her
law.
i
have
said
in
the
utmost
good
faith
that
when
this
case
was
before
the
court
of
first
instance,
which
by
the
way
happens
to
be
our
lowest
criminal
court,
which
does
not
always
keep
up
with
the
advanced
sheets
even
in
our
state.
when
this
case
was
before
that
court,
it
should
--
the
motion
to
suppress
should
have
been
granted
in
that
court,
because
the
case
was
not
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
stop
and
frisk
statute,
it
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause.
i
have
said
with
the
utmost
sincerity
that
there
wasn't
even
enough
reasonable
suspicion
under
the
statute,
much
less
probable
cause
under
the
constitution.
unless
mrs.
oberman
remembers
quickly
(inaudible)
she
would
give
me
credit,
but
there's
–
but
apparently
she's
afraid
that
i'm
a
greek
bringing
gifts
from
a
wooden
horse.
i
say
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
humiliating
confession.
ours
is
a
large
office
and
i
am
the
head
of
the
appeals
bureau
of
a
very
large
office
and
with
the
exception
of
the
actual
trial
of
cases,
there
is
no
phase
of
the
work
of
my
office,
which
is
departmentalized,
but
which
includes
numbers
almost
100
men
i
think,
with
which
i
don't
at
least
in
theory
have
something
to
do,
whether
it's
question
of
validity
of
an
indictment
or
anything,
this
funnels
into
me.
i've
got
ten
assistants;
i
have
to
deal
with
the
criminal
court.
i
have
to
deal
with
everything
there
is,
and
i
don't
just
supervise
your
honors,
i
do
some
of
the
work
and
in
fact
a
good
part
of
the
work.
this
was
a
run-of-the-mine
case.
mrs.
oberman
seemed
to
have
found
that
somewhat
objectionable,
but
i
think
it's
very
descriptive.
this
was
the
run-of-the-mine
case,
which
came
out
of
the
lower
criminal
court.
it
never
came
to
my
attention
until
it
was
on
the
calendar
so
to
speak
of
this
court.
had
i
known
about
it,
in
the
appellant
term
i
would
have
consented
to
a
reversal.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
have
consented
to
a
reversal,
because
there
just
--
the
case
just
doesn't
even
meet
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
there
isn't
reasonable
ground.
there
wasn't
reasonable
ground
to
suspect
that
sibron
was
committing
a
crime,
because
all
the
officer
saw
him
to
do
was
talk
to
people
who
the
officer
knew
to
be
narcotics
addicts,
he
knew
noting
about
sibron.
now
a
narcotic
addict
is
not
an
outlaw.
he
can
talk
to
anybody,
and
pari
passu,
anybody
can
talk
to
him.
the
same
thing
happened
in
lasko.
there
is
absent
the
first
(inaudible),
which
a
condition
precedent
for
the
operation
of
the
statute.
the
second
element,
the
danger
to
the
police
officer
i
think
was
equally
absent.
the
officer
said,
“you
know
what
i
want?”
so
sibron
responds
to
an
invitation
and
he
puts
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
as
he
does
so
this
sort
of
pulls
the
pocket
further
apart
and
the
officer
sees
a
white
metal
or
cellophane
article.
that's
one
aspect
of
it
and
simultaneously
he
puts
his
hand
in
there,
that's
another
aspect.
the
third
aspect
is
that
the
--
sibron
really
was
responding
to
the
invitation
of
the
officer,
if
you
got
anything
in
your
pocket,
give
it
to
me.
so
i
really
honesty
feel,
always
have
felt
and
despite
any
information,
i'm
quite
sincere
always
will
be,
that
this
case
ought
to
be
reversed.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
know
of
such
procedure
honor
i
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
this
should
be
been
made
by
my
adversary.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
and
besides
i
had
another
problem.
i
first
learned
of
it
when
it
was
here.
now
this
to
me
seemed
to
oust
new
york's
court
of
appeals'
jurisdiction
at
any
moment.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh
i
would
pray
that
the
direction
implicitly
on
such
a
declamation,
but
i
don't
where
i'd
get.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
may
i
ask
reconsideration
of
what
your
honor?
judgment?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
if
you
did
that,
i'd
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say
what
i
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
this
was
the
second
possible
statement
i'd
have
to
make.
i
have
to
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
call
your
attention
to
fact
that
sibron
has
completely
served
his
sentence
and
possibly
[laughter]
under
the
late
--[laughter]
mr.
william
i.
siegel
under
you
late
decision
in
jacobs
against
new
york,
which
was
decided
on
june
12,
1967,
it's
moot
for
another
reason.
my
major
concern
your
honor
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
it
was
a
misdemeanor
in
which
i
think
he
got
60
days
and
a
suspended
sentence.
the
chief
justice
decided
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
six
months.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
i
have
a
certificate
with
me.
he
served
four
months,
he
gets
ten
days
a
month
off,
he
served
four
months,
but
he
was
discharged
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
if
your
honors
rule
as
perhaps
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
it
became
moot
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
he
was
sentenced
to
six
months
on
--
he
was
sentenced
to
six
months
on
april
23,
1965.
so
certainly
six
months
after
that,
it
would
be
moot.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
unless
there
was
a
certificate
of
reasonable
doubt,
he'd
start
serving
that
same
day.
in
my
recollection
mrs.
oberman
may
be
able
to
confirm
that
there
was
no
certificate
of
reasonable
doubt,
so
that
within
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
one
thing
–-
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
on
the
record
i'm
giving
your
honors
the
date
of
the
sentence
shown
by
the
record,
which
would
be
april
23,
1965.
now
i
have
with
me,
if
i
may
refer
to
it,
there
was
the
record,
i
have
a
certificate
from
the
new
york
city
department
of
correction
dated
and
numbered.
this
is
to
verify
that
the
following
information
is
on
record.
name
nelson
sibron,
number,
that
is
his
penitentiary
number,
address,
age.
in
custody
from
march
10,
1965
to
july
8,
1965,
original
charge
1751,
section
33056
mos,
months,
penitentiary
remarks
-
in
custody
continuously,
released
by
expiration
of
sentence.
i
see
that
singed
and
it
bears
not
a
seal,
but
the
stamp
with
–-
mr.
william
i.
siegel
released
by
expiration
of
sentence,
which
would
mean
that
at
the
latest
it
would
be
six
months
from
april
23rd,
and
it
says
in
custody
from
3/10/65
to
7/8
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
i
don't
know
that,
that
has
been
included
your
honor.
this
man
--
we
don't
have
such
document
i
know
of
to
moot
this.
this
man
is
entitled
to
have
his
record
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
then
your
honor,
i
push
ahead
of
the
department,
all
i
can
say
is
[inaudible]
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
we
did.
did
we
object?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
personally,
no.
i
don't
think
my
–-
now
i'd
like
to
ask
the
court
a
question
if
i
may.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
can't
think
of
any.
he
was
sentenced
as
a
multiple
offender.
i
think
under
our
narcotics
statute
it
would
make
no
difference
how
multiple
he
was
the
next
time
he
came
up,
if
he
came
up
with
that.
as
a
multiple
felony
offender,
the
conviction
would
not
count
because
it's
a
misdemeanor.
so
far
as
any
lawsuit
for
citizenship,
so
long
that
terminates
with
the
termination
of
his
sentence,
i
cannot
suggest
that
there's
any
distinction
between
this
and
the
--
well
the
case
i
understand.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
he
had
plenty
to
count
against
him
no
doubt.
his
record,
i
think
he
was
burglar
and
he
had
former
narcotics
convictions,
he
was
not
a
nice
person.
wherever
[laughter]
he
might
be
inclined
to
apply
and
his
record
would
come
into
question,
he
had
enough
without
this.
now
may
i
please
ask
you
a
question?
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
considered
as
having
argued
on
the
merits
or
not.
if
i
have
not
argued
on
the
merits
and
the
court
wants
to
hear
me,
i
want
to
save
20
minutes
for
mr.
juviler
who
comes
from
mr.
hogan's
office.
if
i
am
foreclosed
by
either
mootness
or
any
other
consideration
and
my
argument
on
the
merits,
i'd
like
to
apply
to
be
considered
as
amicus
in
the
peters
case
and
i
have
the
consent
of
mr.
duggan
who
will
argue
for
new
york
and
i
have
the
consent
of
mr.
friedman,
his
adversary
who
will
represent
the
defendant.
so
whether
your
honors
will
let
me
argue
here,
argue
as
amicus,
and
mr.
duggan
said
he
can
use
in
time
or
merely
consider
my
brief
in
peters,
at
least
i
know
that
to
the
extent
that
i
can
at
this
moment,
this
late
day,
do
something
for
the
state
of
new
york,
i
have
done
what
i
could.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
we
both
have
the
notion
--
i
do
know
procedurally
if
we
are
right
or
not,
that
if
i
am
up,
if
this
case
is
out
for
moot
or
for
any
reason
peters
becomes
the
principal
case
and
mr.
duggan
then
has
an
hour,
instead
of
half
of
an
hour
and
if
he
has
an
hour,
he
is
graciously
consented
to
yield
a
half
an
hour
to
me.
would
you
let
me
do
this
your
honors?
i'll
talk
five
minutes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
translated
into
a
wrong
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
all
right
then.
may
i
reserve
such
time
as
you
will
give
me
in
the
peters
case
for
the
balance
of
my
argument
of
this
case?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
and
in
these
few
minutes
i
want
to
make
specific
if
i
can
an
argument
which
i
think
has
informed
the
general
discussion
that
which
i
can't
believe
has
been
put
in
haec
verba.
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
historical
product
of
the
experiences
of
the
colonists
with
the
minions
of
king
george
who
would
walk
into
a
man's
home
and
rummage
among
his
papers
and
who
when
they
went
into
his
home
had
the
express
purpose
of
finding
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
he
could
be
arrested,
convicted,
and
imprisoned.
and
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
with
its
two
clauses
one
prohibiting
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
and
the
other
restricting
the
right
to
search
to
search
warrants
that
is
to
search
is
made
upon
severely
restricted
warrants,
pictures
this
historic
genesis
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now
--
and
this
court
has
had
occasion
before
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
search
permitted
even
under
the
restricted
language,
the
restrictive
language
of
the
fourth
amendment.
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out
in
the
history
of
this
court
that
you
could
search
in
vain
in
the
fourth
amendment
for
the
right
to
search
as
an
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
itself
based
on
probable
cause
and
yet
ex
necessitate
because
conditions
required
if
this
court
laid
down
this,
or
may
i
say
engrafted
upon
the
fourth
amendment,
this
exception
which
cannot
be
found
in
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
itself.
just
because
the
purpose
of
the
search
and
in
this
agreement
which
some
of
my
colleagues
i
believe
new
york
has
authorized
a
full
search
in
the
taggart
case
just
because
the
purpose
of
the
search
is
not
to
procure
evidence
upon
which
to
convict
a
man,
but
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
officer
in
the
performance
of
his
obligatory
public
duty
and
his
very
necessary
public
duty.
the
standard
of
probable
cause
can
be
relaxed
because
the
purpose
of
the
search
is
not
the
historically
prohibited
purpose
of
entrapping
a
man
and
out
of
his
own
effects
and
papers
convicting
him.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
and
since
this
is
so,
the
standard
i
say
maybe
less
than
probable
cause.
now
it
has
been
objected
here
that
probable
cause
is
an
amorphous
standard,
something
you
can't,
--
i
mean
reasonable
suspicion
is
something
which
cannot
be
measured,
it
cannot
be
weighed
but
by
the
same
token
probable
cause
cannot
be
lineally
measured
or
quantitatively
weighed.
it
has
to
be
hammered
out
on
the
anvil
of
the
experience
and
litigation
from
case-to-case
until
there
will
arise
or
be
created
or
there
will
emerge
a
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
such
as
this
court
was
able
to
do
in
the
brinegar
case
about
probable
cause.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
here
again
your
honor
i
am
in
disagreement
with
judge
van
voorhis
who
would
restrict
the
usability
of
it
to
the
weapon
for
the
protection
against
which
the
policeman
is
permitted
to
make
the
search.
there
is
an
analogy
i
think
here
with
an
arrest
based
on
probable
cause,
a
search
incidental
to
that
arrest,
that
search
is
permitted
for
a
weapon
in
order
to
safeguard
the
officer
for
the
means
of
instrumentalities
with
which
that
crime
was
committed
or
for
the
fruits
of
that
crime
and
yet
if
the
search
is
based
upon
an
incidental
to
unlawful
arrest
and
it
turns
up
some
contraband
completely
independent
of
the
fruits
or
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
with
relation
to
which
the
search
was
originally
made
the
defendant
can
be
prosecuted
for
that.
now
if
that
is
so
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
ask
that.
i
didn't
intend
to
say
that.
i
am
saying
that
this
is
not
prohibited
by
the
constitution
because
the
purpose
for
which
this
search
is
made
is
not
the
purpose
for
which
the
fourth
amendment
was
written
and
is
not
the
purpose
for
which
the
exclusionary
rule
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
an
implementation
of
it
was
created
by
this
court.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
every
question
of
fact
which
comes
before
a
court
has
to
be
resolved
by
the
court
from
the
evidence
before
it
and
i
suppose
this
will
have
to
be
also
and
i
also
don't
understand
and
this
will
be
my
last
word,
the
abhorrence
with
which
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
if
i
may
say
so
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
play
on
words.
if
his
search
of
the
right
hand
pocket
discloses
a
weapon,
it
is
true
that
he
can
arrest
for
the
possession
of
that
weapon,
but
that
doesn't
mean
he
can't
search
the
left
pocket
because
there
might
be
other
weapon
in
the
left
pocket
and
while
i
don't
want
to
go
to
the
extreme
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
only
--
if
i
may
give
you
an
analogy.
under
a
search
warrant
when
i'm
looking
for
a
typewriter
and
that's
to
describe
property,
i
can
i
can
look
in
the
big
desk,
a
big
drawer
of
the
desk,
they
come
this
big,
i
can't
look
in
a
little
drawer.
i
can
look
in
the
big
drawer
because
a
typewriter
could
be
put
in
there.
i
can't
look
in
the
little
drawer
because
a
typewriter
can't
be
put
in
there.
now
while
i
am
searching
in
the
big
drawer
if
i
find
some
other
contraband
stolen
property
whatever
it
is
i
can
keep
it
and
i
can
prosecute
for
it.
if
i
find
in
the
little
drawer
i
can't
use
it,
i
can't
prosecute
for.
now
one
the
thing
i
want
to
say
if
i
may
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
this
depends
too
because
he
can't
have
a
razor
blade
down
here
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
you
honor
it
will
have
to
depend
on
the
case,
the
person,
the
time
of
the
day,
the
time
of
the
night,
past
history,
the
knowledge
of
the
police
officer
with
respect
to
this
particular
suspect
and
so
on.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
for
convenience
i
would
say
no,
[laughter]
it
is
very
unlikely.
may
i
make
this
last
statement
your
honor?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
hope
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
may
i
say
just
this
one
word.
there
has
been
a
generally
expressed
disapproval
of
the
utilization
of
the
police
officer's
sixth
sense
or
instinct
which
he
gets
by
way
of
his
experience.
i
can't
see
this.
in
every
other
place,
in
every
other
field
of
human
activity
experience
is
valuable
and
people
are
supposed
to
benefit
by
the
utilization
of
their
experience.
now
why
must
we
throw
away
the
policemen's
experience
because
it
maybe
used
improperly,
that
is
what
courts
exist
for
and
the
fact
that
there
maybe
a
misuse
of
his
power,
does
not
mean
that
we
have
to
destroy
the
power
and
deprive
the
community
of
the
benefits
which
a
proper
exercise
of
the
power
brings.
i
said
in
my
brief
that
this
would
be
very
much
like
charles
lamb's
burning
down
the
barn
in
order
to
get
rose
pig,
there's
a
much
easier
way
to
do
it
and
i
thank
your
honors
for
the
privilege.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice
–
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
develop
my
argument,
if
indeed
i
develop
an
argument;
one,
perhaps
two
and
maybe
three
preliminary
statements
which
i
want
to
make.
i
want
to
make
them
because
first
i
owe
them
to
the
court
and
secondly
i
want
to
make
them
as
a
sort
of
apologia
pro
vita
mia
in
this
case,
because
this
is
a
most
unusual
case
by
the
district
attorney
representing
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york,
comes
into
this
court
to
make
a
confession
of
error
on
the
part
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
mr.
justice
brennan
said
why
didn't
why
didn't
we
do
it
before
and
i
assure
you
that
i
find
it
personally
very
disagreeable
to
have
to
make
this
confession
of
error
before
this
tribunal,
because
i
have
the
highest
regard
for
the
judges
of
our
court
of
appeals.
i
sustain
a
friendly,
personal
relationship
with
some
of
them
and
if
it
had
been
in
the
cards,
so
to
speak,
for
me
to
have
done
it
in
albany
rather
than
in
washington,
i
would
have
been
most
pleased
to
do
so.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
know
of
no
procedure
which
would
have
enabled
me
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
what
i
am
(inaudible)
saying
to
this
court
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
correct,
and
i
don't
know
i
maybe
wrong.
in
this
case
i'm
in
the
unfortunate
predicament
of
finding
myself
in
disagreement
with
almost
everybody.
i
disagree
with
[laughter]
i
disagree
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
disagree
in
some
respects
with
mr.
juviler
to
whom
i
have
yielded
20
minutes
of
my
time,
as
amicus
representing
the
new
york
county
district
attorney.
most
regretfully
i
disagree
with
mrs.
oberman,
whose
scholarship
is
equaled
only
by
her
charm
and
beauty.
i
am
sorry
that
in
this
instance
she
seems
to
remember
her
latin
much
better
than
she
does
her
law.
i
have
said
in
the
utmost
good
faith
that
when
this
case
was
before
the
court
of
first
instance,
which
by
the
way
happens
to
be
our
lowest
criminal
court,
which
does
not
always
keep
up
with
the
advanced
sheets
even
in
our
state.
when
this
case
was
before
that
court,
it
should
--
the
motion
to
suppress
should
have
been
granted
in
that
court,
because
the
case
was
not
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
stop
and
frisk
statute,
it
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause.
i
have
said
with
the
utmost
sincerity
that
there
wasn't
even
enough
reasonable
suspicion
under
the
statute,
much
less
probable
cause
under
the
constitution.
unless
mrs.
oberman
remembers
quickly
(inaudible)
she
would
give
me
credit,
but
there's
–
but
apparently
she's
afraid
that
i'm
a
greek
bringing
gifts
from
a
wooden
horse.
i
say
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
humiliating
confession.
ours
is
a
large
office
and
i
am
the
head
of
the
appeals
bureau
of
a
very
large
office
and
with
the
exception
of
the
actual
trial
of
cases,
there
is
no
phase
of
the
work
of
my
office,
which
is
departmentalized,
but
which
includes
numbers
almost
100
men
i
think,
with
which
i
don't
at
least
in
theory
have
something
to
do,
whether
it's
question
of
validity
of
an
indictment
or
anything,
this
funnels
into
me.
i've
got
ten
assistants;
i
have
to
deal
with
the
criminal
court.
i
have
to
deal
with
everything
there
is,
and
i
don't
just
supervise
your
honors,
i
do
some
of
the
work
and
in
fact
a
good
part
of
the
work.
this
was
a
run-of-the-mine
case.
mrs.
oberman
seemed
to
have
found
that
somewhat
objectionable,
but
i
think
it's
very
descriptive.
this
was
the
run-of-the-mine
case,
which
came
out
of
the
lower
criminal
court.
it
never
came
to
my
attention
until
it
was
on
the
calendar
so
to
speak
of
this
court.
had
i
known
about
it,
in
the
appellant
term
i
would
have
consented
to
a
reversal.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
have
consented
to
a
reversal,
because
there
just
--
the
case
just
doesn't
even
meet
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
there
isn't
reasonable
ground.
there
wasn't
reasonable
ground
to
suspect
that
sibron
was
committing
a
crime,
because
all
the
officer
saw
him
to
do
was
talk
to
people
who
the
officer
knew
to
be
narcotics
addicts,
he
knew
noting
about
sibron.
now
a
narcotic
addict
is
not
an
outlaw.
he
can
talk
to
anybody,
and
pari
passu,
anybody
can
talk
to
him.
the
same
thing
happened
in
lasko.
there
is
absent
the
first
(inaudible),
which
a
condition
precedent
for
the
operation
of
the
statute.
the
second
element,
the
danger
to
the
police
officer
i
think
was
equally
absent.
the
officer
said,
“you
know
what
i
want?”
so
sibron
responds
to
an
invitation
and
he
puts
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
as
he
does
so
this
sort
of
pulls
the
pocket
further
apart
and
the
officer
sees
a
white
metal
or
cellophane
article.
that's
one
aspect
of
it
and
simultaneously
he
puts
his
hand
in
there,
that's
another
aspect.
the
third
aspect
is
that
the
--
sibron
really
was
responding
to
the
invitation
of
the
officer,
if
you
got
anything
in
your
pocket,
give
it
to
me.
so
i
really
honesty
feel,
always
have
felt
and
despite
any
information,
i'm
quite
sincere
always
will
be,
that
this
case
ought
to
be
reversed.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
know
of
such
procedure
honor
i
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
this
should
be
been
made
by
my
adversary.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
and
besides
i
had
another
problem.
i
first
learned
of
it
when
it
was
here.
now
this
to
me
seemed
to
oust
new
york's
court
of
appeals'
jurisdiction
at
any
moment.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh
i
would
pray
that
the
direction
implicitly
on
such
a
declamation,
but
i
don't
where
i'd
get.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
may
i
ask
reconsideration
of
what
your
honor?
judgment?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
if
you
did
that,
i'd
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say
what
i
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
this
was
the
second
possible
statement
i'd
have
to
make.
i
have
to
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
call
your
attention
to
fact
that
sibron
has
completely
served
his
sentence
and
possibly
[laughter]
under
the
late
--[laughter]
mr.
william
i.
siegel
under
you
late
decision
in
jacobs
against
new
york,
which
was
decided
on
june
12,
1967,
it's
moot
for
another
reason.
my
major
concern
your
honor
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
it
was
a
misdemeanor
in
which
i
think
he
got
60
days
and
a
suspended
sentence.
the
chief
justice
decided
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
six
months.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
i
have
a
certificate
with
me.
he
served
four
months,
he
gets
ten
days
a
month
off,
he
served
four
months,
but
he
was
discharged
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
if
your
honors
rule
as
perhaps
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
it
became
moot
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
he
was
sentenced
to
six
months
on
--
he
was
sentenced
to
six
months
on
april
23,
1965.
so
certainly
six
months
after
that,
it
would
be
moot.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
unless
there
was
a
certificate
of
reasonable
doubt,
he'd
start
serving
that
same
day.
in
my
recollection
mrs.
oberman
may
be
able
to
confirm
that
there
was
no
certificate
of
reasonable
doubt,
so
that
within
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
one
thing
–-
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
on
the
record
i'm
giving
your
honors
the
date
of
the
sentence
shown
by
the
record,
which
would
be
april
23,
1965.
now
i
have
with
me,
if
i
may
refer
to
it,
there
was
the
record,
i
have
a
certificate
from
the
new
york
city
department
of
correction
dated
and
numbered.
this
is
to
verify
that
the
following
information
is
on
record.
name
nelson
sibron,
number,
that
is
his
penitentiary
number,
address,
age.
in
custody
from
march
10,
1965
to
july
8,
1965,
original
charge
1751,
section
33056
mos,
months,
penitentiary
remarks
-
in
custody
continuously,
released
by
expiration
of
sentence.
i
see
that
singed
and
it
bears
not
a
seal,
but
the
stamp
with
–-
mr.
william
i.
siegel
released
by
expiration
of
sentence,
which
would
mean
that
at
the
latest
it
would
be
six
months
from
april
23rd,
and
it
says
in
custody
from
3/10/65
to
7/8
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
i
don't
know
that,
that
has
been
included
your
honor.
this
man
--
we
don't
have
such
document
i
know
of
to
moot
this.
this
man
is
entitled
to
have
his
record
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
then
your
honor,
i
push
ahead
of
the
department,
all
i
can
say
is
[inaudible]
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
we
did.
did
we
object?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
personally,
no.
i
don't
think
my
–-
now
i'd
like
to
ask
the
court
a
question
if
i
may.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
can't
think
of
any.
he
was
sentenced
as
a
multiple
offender.
i
think
under
our
narcotics
statute
it
would
make
no
difference
how
multiple
he
was
the
next
time
he
came
up,
if
he
came
up
with
that.
as
a
multiple
felony
offender,
the
conviction
would
not
count
because
it's
a
misdemeanor.
so
far
as
any
lawsuit
for
citizenship,
so
long
that
terminates
with
the
termination
of
his
sentence,
i
cannot
suggest
that
there's
any
distinction
between
this
and
the
--
well
the
case
i
understand.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
he
had
plenty
to
count
against
him
no
doubt.
his
record,
i
think
he
was
burglar
and
he
had
former
narcotics
convictions,
he
was
not
a
nice
person.
wherever
[laughter]
he
might
be
inclined
to
apply
and
his
record
would
come
into
question,
he
had
enough
without
this.
now
may
i
please
ask
you
a
question?
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
considered
as
having
argued
on
the
merits
or
not.
if
i
have
not
argued
on
the
merits
and
the
court
wants
to
hear
me,
i
want
to
save
20
minutes
for
mr.
juviler
who
comes
from
mr.
hogan's
office.
if
i
am
foreclosed
by
either
mootness
or
any
other
consideration
and
my
argument
on
the
merits,
i'd
like
to
apply
to
be
considered
as
amicus
in
the
peters
case
and
i
have
the
consent
of
mr.
duggan
who
will
argue
for
new
york
and
i
have
the
consent
of
mr.
friedman,
his
adversary
who
will
represent
the
defendant.
so
whether
your
honors
will
let
me
argue
here,
argue
as
amicus,
and
mr.
duggan
said
he
can
use
in
time
or
merely
consider
my
brief
in
peters,
at
least
i
know
that
to
the
extent
that
i
can
at
this
moment,
this
late
day,
do
something
for
the
state
of
new
york,
i
have
done
what
i
could.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
we
both
have
the
notion
--
i
do
know
procedurally
if
we
are
right
or
not,
that
if
i
am
up,
if
this
case
is
out
for
moot
or
for
any
reason
peters
becomes
the
principal
case
and
mr.
duggan
then
has
an
hour,
instead
of
half
of
an
hour
and
if
he
has
an
hour,
he
is
graciously
consented
to
yield
a
half
an
hour
to
me.
would
you
let
me
do
this
your
honors?
i'll
talk
five
minutes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
translated
into
a
wrong
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
all
right
then.
may
i
reserve
such
time
as
you
will
give
me
in
the
peters
case
for
the
balance
of
my
argument
of
this
case?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
and
in
these
few
minutes
i
want
to
make
specific
if
i
can
an
argument
which
i
think
has
informed
the
general
discussion
that
which
i
can't
believe
has
been
put
in
haec
verba.
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
historical
product
of
the
experiences
of
the
colonists
with
the
minions
of
king
george
who
would
walk
into
a
man's
home
and
rummage
among
his
papers
and
who
when
they
went
into
his
home
had
the
express
purpose
of
finding
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
he
could
be
arrested,
convicted,
and
imprisoned.
and
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
with
its
two
clauses
one
prohibiting
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
and
the
other
restricting
the
right
to
search
to
search
warrants
that
is
to
search
is
made
upon
severely
restricted
warrants,
pictures
this
historic
genesis
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now
--
and
this
court
has
had
occasion
before
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
search
permitted
even
under
the
restricted
language,
the
restrictive
language
of
the
fourth
amendment.
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out
in
the
history
of
this
court
that
you
could
search
in
vain
in
the
fourth
amendment
for
the
right
to
search
as
an
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
itself
based
on
probable
cause
and
yet
ex
necessitate
because
conditions
required
if
this
court
laid
down
this,
or
may
i
say
engrafted
upon
the
fourth
amendment,
this
exception
which
cannot
be
found
in
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
itself.
just
because
the
purpose
of
the
search
and
in
this
agreement
which
some
of
my
colleagues
i
believe
new
york
has
authorized
a
full
search
in
the
taggart
case
just
because
the
purpose
of
the
search
is
not
to
procure
evidence
upon
which
to
convict
a
man,
but
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
officer
in
the
performance
of
his
obligatory
public
duty
and
his
very
necessary
public
duty.
the
standard
of
probable
cause
can
be
relaxed
because
the
purpose
of
the
search
is
not
the
historically
prohibited
purpose
of
entrapping
a
man
and
out
of
his
own
effects
and
papers
convicting
him.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
and
since
this
is
so,
the
standard
i
say
maybe
less
than
probable
cause.
now
it
has
been
objected
here
that
probable
cause
is
an
amorphous
standard,
something
you
can't,
--
i
mean
reasonable
suspicion
is
something
which
cannot
be
measured,
it
cannot
be
weighed
but
by
the
same
token
probable
cause
cannot
be
lineally
measured
or
quantitatively
weighed.
it
has
to
be
hammered
out
on
the
anvil
of
the
experience
and
litigation
from
case-to-case
until
there
will
arise
or
be
created
or
there
will
emerge
a
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
such
as
this
court
was
able
to
do
in
the
brinegar
case
about
probable
cause.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
here
again
your
honor
i
am
in
disagreement
with
judge
van
voorhis
who
would
restrict
the
usability
of
it
to
the
weapon
for
the
protection
against
which
the
policeman
is
permitted
to
make
the
search.
there
is
an
analogy
i
think
here
with
an
arrest
based
on
probable
cause,
a
search
incidental
to
that
arrest,
that
search
is
permitted
for
a
weapon
in
order
to
safeguard
the
officer
for
the
means
of
instrumentalities
with
which
that
crime
was
committed
or
for
the
fruits
of
that
crime
and
yet
if
the
search
is
based
upon
an
incidental
to
unlawful
arrest
and
it
turns
up
some
contraband
completely
independent
of
the
fruits
or
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
with
relation
to
which
the
search
was
originally
made
the
defendant
can
be
prosecuted
for
that.
now
if
that
is
so
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
ask
that.
i
didn't
intend
to
say
that.
i
am
saying
that
this
is
not
prohibited
by
the
constitution
because
the
purpose
for
which
this
search
is
made
is
not
the
purpose
for
which
the
fourth
amendment
was
written
and
is
not
the
purpose
for
which
the
exclusionary
rule
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
an
implementation
of
it
was
created
by
this
court.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
every
question
of
fact
which
comes
before
a
court
has
to
be
resolved
by
the
court
from
the
evidence
before
it
and
i
suppose
this
will
have
to
be
also
and
i
also
don't
understand
and
this
will
be
my
last
word,
the
abhorrence
with
which
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
if
i
may
say
so
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
play
on
words.
if
his
search
of
the
right
hand
pocket
discloses
a
weapon,
it
is
true
that
he
can
arrest
for
the
possession
of
that
weapon,
but
that
doesn't
mean
he
can't
search
the
left
pocket
because
there
might
be
other
weapon
in
the
left
pocket
and
while
i
don't
want
to
go
to
the
extreme
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
only
--
if
i
may
give
you
an
analogy.
under
a
search
warrant
when
i'm
looking
for
a
typewriter
and
that's
to
describe
property,
i
can
i
can
look
in
the
big
desk,
a
big
drawer
of
the
desk,
they
come
this
big,
i
can't
look
in
a
little
drawer.
i
can
look
in
the
big
drawer
because
a
typewriter
could
be
put
in
there.
i
can't
look
in
the
little
drawer
because
a
typewriter
can't
be
put
in
there.
now
while
i
am
searching
in
the
big
drawer
if
i
find
some
other
contraband
stolen
property
whatever
it
is
i
can
keep
it
and
i
can
prosecute
for
it.
if
i
find
in
the
little
drawer
i
can't
use
it,
i
can't
prosecute
for.
now
one
the
thing
i
want
to
say
if
i
may
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
this
depends
too
because
he
can't
have
a
razor
blade
down
here
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
you
honor
it
will
have
to
depend
on
the
case,
the
person,
the
time
of
the
day,
the
time
of
the
night,
past
history,
the
knowledge
of
the
police
officer
with
respect
to
this
particular
suspect
and
so
on.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
for
convenience
i
would
say
no,
[laughter]
it
is
very
unlikely.
may
i
make
this
last
statement
your
honor?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
hope
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
may
i
say
just
this
one
word.
there
has
been
a
generally
expressed
disapproval
of
the
utilization
of
the
police
officer's
sixth
sense
or
instinct
which
he
gets
by
way
of
his
experience.
i
can't
see
this.
in
every
other
place,
in
every
other
field
of
human
activity
experience
is
valuable
and
people
are
supposed
to
benefit
by
the
utilization
of
their
experience.
now
why
must
we
throw
away
the
policemen's
experience
because
it
maybe
used
improperly,
that
is
what
courts
exist
for
and
the
fact
that
there
maybe
a
misuse
of
his
power,
does
not
mean
that
we
have
to
destroy
the
power
and
deprive
the
community
of
the
benefits
which
a
proper
exercise
of
the
power
brings.
i
said
in
my
brief
that
this
would
be
very
much
like
charles
lamb's
burning
down
the
barn
in
order
to
get
rose
pig,
there's
a
much
easier
way
to
do
it
and
i
thank
your
honors
for
the
privilege.
