justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
have
peters
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
the
question
posed
in
the
other
new
york
case
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
even
that
the
--
even
if
we
deal
with
verbatim
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that,
what
situation
is
the
statute
[inaudible]
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
have
been
a
breach
to
constitutionality
of
the
statute
rather
than
other
state.
it
still
means
that
it
still
must,
just
as
applied
in
this
case
it
might
be,
held
to
be
unconstitutional,
just
like
an
ordinary
search
and
seizure
case
where
the
state
affirms
a
conviction
in
which
there
is
a
claim
we
then
have
to
claim
it
illegal
search,
we
don't
even
have
that,
and
we
agree
with
it
we
don't
declare
the
statute
authorizes
the
search
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
we
are
bound
by
the
higher
state
of
board
to
believe
their
statute
does
apply
to
these
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
matter,
it
doesn't
mean
the
reason
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
hope
so
i
can
do
it
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
didn't
the
[inaudible]
also
think
the
taggart
or
some
later
case,
the
statute
has
been
limited
so
as
not
to
cover
narcotics
offenses
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
didn't
ask
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
ask
you
about
whether
it
was
taggart
[inaudible]
he
did
it,
but
is
that
his
suggestion.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
related
cases
to
this
one
in
the
court
of
appeals
has
put
a
construction
on
this
statute,
either
that
is
different
than
the
construction
put
on
this
case,
we
should
pay
attention
to
the
later
cases,
not
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
other
later
cases
that
are
relevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
peters
before
sibron?
justice
byron
r.
white
together,
and
then
only
taggart
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
when
one
has
some
fear
of
bodily
harm
[inaudible]
to
determine,
there's
any
crime
committed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
you
may
go
ahead
and
search
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
we
remanded
it,
what
if
we
did
take
you
to
the
judge
and
[inaudible]
remanded
for
a
consideration
of
light
of
the
confession
of
error
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
after
all
they
said
that
your
--
well
they
take
the
position
which
you
don't
agree
and
so
the
key
certainly
is
to
move,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
really
you
don't
move
because
unless
we
do
something
either
the
final
judgment
or
the
final
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
moot
for
another
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
certainly
would
have
then
released
and
served
his
sentence
by
the
time
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
this
case
long
ago,
if
you
follow
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
did
your
office
file
a
response
to
state
the
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
–
[laughter]
did
you
make
any
suggestion
to
moot
this
with
any
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
to
within
the
meaning
of
the
stop
and
frisk
statute,
what
the
officer
did
it
went
beyond
--
what
you
think
the
officer
could
constitutionally
do
under
the
stop
and
frisk
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
he
should
not
have
--
the
kind
of
search
that
he
made
exceed
constitutional
limit?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
mean
–
don't
you
mean
he
just
had
–
he
had
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
him,
to
stop
him
and
detain
him
momentarily
and
to
frisk
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
taggart?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
taggart?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
that,
do
you
think
the
new
york
court
upheld
that
there
must
be
a
preliminary
frisk
before
there's
a
search
--
before
even
actually
reaching
to
somebody's
pocket
there
must
be
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
what
it
was
the
law
enforcement
people
have
in
sustaining
this
--
the
right
to
have
what
you
call
this
temporary
confrontation,
which
would
authorize
and
enforce
the
detention
for
a
few
moments?
why
is
that
so
much
better,
produce
so
much
more
consequences
than
just
the
fact
if
an
officer
presence
making
his
presence
known,
and
doing
what
any
officer
could
do
anyway
without
a
statute
or
without
any
constitutional
problem
just
walking
up
to
some
person
asking
him
a
question
what
are
you
doing
here,
without
being
able
to
detain
him,
fellow
walked
on,
that's
the
end
of
it?
what
real
contribution
does
the
ability
to
forcibly
detain
him
for
a
moment,
for
a
few
moments?
what
additional
contribution
to
that
to
prevention
of
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
major
justification
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
here
is
standing
on
the
street
corner
and
i
suspect
you
maybe
planning
some
crime
and
i
ask
you
your
name,
i
can
do
that
without
invoking
stop-and-frisk
and
if
you
tell
me
i
suppose
that's
--
then
i
know
the
name,
but
if
you
say
none
of
your
business
or
you
can
say
that
and
stop-and-frisk
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
courts
say
that
nobody
can
make
you
talk
about
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
again
i
ask
you
what
contribution
does
this,
this
enforced
custody
for
a
few
moments
make
to
law
enforcement
or
crime
prevention?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
he
need
some
coercive
power
to
help
him
do
this?
why
does
he
need
any
new
constitutional
rule
beyond
what
they're
going
to
--
what
already
exists?
there
is
no
rules
as
far
as
i
know
against
a
policeman
asking
somebody
on
the
a
street
what
his
name,
what
you
are
doing
on
the
street,
and
of
--
if
the
fellow
now
just
wants
to
walk
on,
he
just
walks
on,
the
policeman
has
no
power
to
hold
him
at
least
--
so
i
don't
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
extra
contribution
stopped
him,
stop-and-frisk
authority
contributes?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
those
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
you
needed
to
stop-and-frisk
law
to
do
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
really
responsible.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
constitutional
authority
do
you
need?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
need
the
restrain
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that's
true,
that's
just
repeating
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
want
to
detain
him
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
gentleman
doesn't
need
to
talk
to
you
or
doesn't
need
to
tell
you
a
word
and
even
under
stop-and-frisk
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
have
to
keep
him
there,
why
do
you
need
to
keep
him
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
danger
that
courts
will
strike
down
without
some
--
just
a
policeman
walking
up
to
anyone
on
the
street
and
say
what
is
your
name,
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
nothing
is
going
to
happen
probably
as
along
the
policeman
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree,
but
at
least
the
fellow
knows
when
the
policeman
is
there,
the
policeman
has
got
his
eye
on
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
fellow
refuses
to
answer
a
question
with
or
without
the
stop-and-frisk
law,
there
is
nothing
the
policeman
can
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
police
is
not
going
to
get
anymore
information,
the
fellow
has
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
just
don't
--
still
don't
get
the
message
in
terms
of
what
contribution
to
law
enforcement
or
over
and
beyond
what
presently
is
you
really
are
getting
from
stop-and-frisk
laws
and
having
them
validated
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
sure
that
the
major
contribution
that
[inaudible]
to
find
weapons?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
like
--
in
new
york
last
year,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
--
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
them
were,
weren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
detain
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
go
and
ask
him
without
reasonable
suspicion
what
his
name
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
has
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
incorporate
any
view
of
the
statute
if
you
disagree
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
have
peters
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
the
question
posed
in
the
other
new
york
case
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
even
that
the
--
even
if
we
deal
with
verbatim
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that,
what
situation
is
the
statute
[inaudible]
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
have
been
a
breach
to
constitutionality
of
the
statute
rather
than
other
state.
it
still
means
that
it
still
must,
just
as
applied
in
this
case
it
might
be,
held
to
be
unconstitutional,
just
like
an
ordinary
search
and
seizure
case
where
the
state
affirms
a
conviction
in
which
there
is
a
claim
we
then
have
to
claim
it
illegal
search,
we
don't
even
have
that,
and
we
agree
with
it
we
don't
declare
the
statute
authorizes
the
search
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
we
are
bound
by
the
higher
state
of
board
to
believe
their
statute
does
apply
to
these
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
matter,
it
doesn't
mean
the
reason
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
hope
so
i
can
do
it
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
didn't
the
[inaudible]
also
think
the
taggart
or
some
later
case,
the
statute
has
been
limited
so
as
not
to
cover
narcotics
offenses
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
didn't
ask
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
ask
you
about
whether
it
was
taggart
[inaudible]
he
did
it,
but
is
that
his
suggestion.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
related
cases
to
this
one
in
the
court
of
appeals
has
put
a
construction
on
this
statute,
either
that
is
different
than
the
construction
put
on
this
case,
we
should
pay
attention
to
the
later
cases,
not
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
other
later
cases
that
are
relevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
peters
before
sibron?
justice
byron
r.
white
together,
and
then
only
taggart
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
when
one
has
some
fear
of
bodily
harm
[inaudible]
to
determine,
there's
any
crime
committed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
you
may
go
ahead
and
search
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
we
remanded
it,
what
if
we
did
take
you
to
the
judge
and
[inaudible]
remanded
for
a
consideration
of
light
of
the
confession
of
error
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
after
all
they
said
that
your
--
well
they
take
the
position
which
you
don't
agree
and
so
the
key
certainly
is
to
move,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
really
you
don't
move
because
unless
we
do
something
either
the
final
judgment
or
the
final
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
moot
for
another
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
certainly
would
have
then
released
and
served
his
sentence
by
the
time
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
this
case
long
ago,
if
you
follow
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
did
your
office
file
a
response
to
state
the
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
–
[laughter]
did
you
make
any
suggestion
to
moot
this
with
any
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
to
within
the
meaning
of
the
stop
and
frisk
statute,
what
the
officer
did
it
went
beyond
--
what
you
think
the
officer
could
constitutionally
do
under
the
stop
and
frisk
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
he
should
not
have
--
the
kind
of
search
that
he
made
exceed
constitutional
limit?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
mean
–
don't
you
mean
he
just
had
–
he
had
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
him,
to
stop
him
and
detain
him
momentarily
and
to
frisk
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
taggart?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
taggart?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
that,
do
you
think
the
new
york
court
upheld
that
there
must
be
a
preliminary
frisk
before
there's
a
search
--
before
even
actually
reaching
to
somebody's
pocket
there
must
be
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
what
it
was
the
law
enforcement
people
have
in
sustaining
this
--
the
right
to
have
what
you
call
this
temporary
confrontation,
which
would
authorize
and
enforce
the
detention
for
a
few
moments?
why
is
that
so
much
better,
produce
so
much
more
consequences
than
just
the
fact
if
an
officer
presence
making
his
presence
known,
and
doing
what
any
officer
could
do
anyway
without
a
statute
or
without
any
constitutional
problem
just
walking
up
to
some
person
asking
him
a
question
what
are
you
doing
here,
without
being
able
to
detain
him,
fellow
walked
on,
that's
the
end
of
it?
what
real
contribution
does
the
ability
to
forcibly
detain
him
for
a
moment,
for
a
few
moments?
what
additional
contribution
to
that
to
prevention
of
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
major
justification
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
here
is
standing
on
the
street
corner
and
i
suspect
you
maybe
planning
some
crime
and
i
ask
you
your
name,
i
can
do
that
without
invoking
stop-and-frisk
and
if
you
tell
me
i
suppose
that's
--
then
i
know
the
name,
but
if
you
say
none
of
your
business
or
you
can
say
that
and
stop-and-frisk
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
courts
say
that
nobody
can
make
you
talk
about
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
again
i
ask
you
what
contribution
does
this,
this
enforced
custody
for
a
few
moments
make
to
law
enforcement
or
crime
prevention?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
he
need
some
coercive
power
to
help
him
do
this?
why
does
he
need
any
new
constitutional
rule
beyond
what
they're
going
to
--
what
already
exists?
there
is
no
rules
as
far
as
i
know
against
a
policeman
asking
somebody
on
the
a
street
what
his
name,
what
you
are
doing
on
the
street,
and
of
--
if
the
fellow
now
just
wants
to
walk
on,
he
just
walks
on,
the
policeman
has
no
power
to
hold
him
at
least
--
so
i
don't
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
extra
contribution
stopped

r.
white
what
are
those
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
you
needed
to
stop-and-frisk
law
to
do
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
really
responsible.
justice
byron
r.
white

repeating
--
justice
byron
r.

you
want

detain
him
for?
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]
gentleman

need

and
even
under
stop-and-frisk
law?
justice

r.
white

you
have

keep
him
there,
why
do
you
need
to
keep
him
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
danger
that
courts
will
strike
down
without
some
--
just
a
policeman
walking
up
to
anyone
on
the
street
and
say
what
is
your
name,
do
you
think?
justice

r.
white
nothing
is
going
to
happen
probably
as
along
the
policeman
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree,
but
at
least
the
fellow
knows
when
the
policeman
is
there,
the
policeman
has
got
his
eye
on
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
fellow
refuses
to
answer
a
question
with
or
without
the
stop-and-frisk
law,
there
is
nothing
the
policeman
can
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
police
is
not
going
to
get
anymore
information,
the
fellow
has
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
just
don't
--
still
don't
get
the
message
in
terms
of
what
contribution
to
law
enforcement
or
over
and
beyond
what
presently
is
you
really
are
getting
from
stop-and-frisk
laws
and
having
them
validated
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
sure
that
the
major
contribution
that
[inaudible]
to

justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
like
--
in
new
york
last
year,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
--
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
them
were,
weren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
detain
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
go
and
ask
him
without
reasonable
suspicion
what
his
name
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
has
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
incorporate
any
view
of
the
statute
if
you
disagree
with
it.
