chief
justice
earl
warren
number
63,
nelson
sibron,
appellant
versus
new
york.
mr.
finkel
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
on
the
other
hand
if
--
would
like
to
have
us
reverse
this
case
regardless
of
how
he
comes
out?[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
simply
because
decide
all
these
hypotheticals
when
we
have
a,
when
we
have
a
case
here,
the
facts
clearly
before
us
and
the
question
is
whether
the
conviction
is
to
view
course
to
whether
it
isn't
that
i
understand
of
mr.
terry
confesses
error
on
why
should
we
have
to
deal
with
all
these
hypotheticals
in
this
case
it
may,
there
will
be
that
in
another
cases
we're
going
to
have
to
do
this,
i
wouldn't
doubt
that,
but
in
this
case
why
should
we
have
to
hear
all
of
this,
why
don't
you
hear
with
the
other
side
going
to
say
and
if
they
don't
get
your
man
off
then
you
might
have
another
situation,
but
they're
going
to,
they're
going
to
let
you
win
the
case
through
their
confession
of
error,
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
why
we
should
take
the
time
to
argue
the
rest
of
this,
in
this
case,
now
there
are
three
cases
here
maybe
in
some
of
the
others
but
they
don't
confess
error,
they
might
have
a
different
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
speak
a
little
louder,
its
hard
for
me
to
hear.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
be
satisfied
with
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
finkel
may
i
ask
you
at
the
trial
of
the
case
is
that,
if
the
police
rely
on
this
statute
under
right,
under
this
statute
–-
chief
justice
earl
warren
–
to
search
this
man
or
did
they
content
that
they
had
probable
cause.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
didn't
and
it
was
raised
in
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
court
didn't
put
it
on
the
basis,
they
put
on
the
basis
did
they
not
put,
the
police
had
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
i
understand
even
in
the
state
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
oberman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
siegel
we
have
no
objection
to
you
arguing
in
the
peters
case,
provided
it
doesn't
have
any
time
to
the
argument.[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
peters
case
is
summary
calender
case
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
don't
want
to
add
any
time
to
the
argument.
you
have
a
little
time
from
him,
it's
perfectly
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
nelson
sibron,
appellant
versus
new
york.
mr.
juviler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
if
the
peters
case
was
tried
on
theory
that
there
was
a
stop
and
frisk?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
a
rationale
of
the
case,
was
it,
not
arrest
for
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
your
argument
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
understanding
to
say
that
the
state
can
rely
first
on
arresting
a
man
for
probable
cause
and
if
they
failed
in
that
that,
they
can
fall
back
to
the
stop
and
frisk
law
and
rely
on
that
because
well
they
didn't
have
probable
cause
they
did
have
reasonable
suspicion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
have
two
bites
at
it.
the
first
you
can
try
--
first
you
can
try
a
probable
cause
and
if
it
fails
in
the
constitutional
sense,
you
can
then
fall
back
on
your
stop
and
frisk
law
and
say
well
at
all
events
we
are
entitled
to
stop
and
frisk
him
and
justify
the
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
problem.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
if
in
this
sibron
case
the
officer
had
reasonable
suspicion
that
this
man
was
carrying
narcotics,
not
probable
cause
for
doing
so
and
had
proceeded
as
he
proceeded
here,
will
the
case
be
relieved
of
error?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
distinguish
the
sibron
case
from
the
stop-and-frisk
law
because
in
sibron
case,
they
not
only
said
they
were
looking
for
weapons
but
they
actually
took
other
things
from
him
and
convicted
him
on
that
score?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
does
the
frisk
end?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
your
concept
of
this
statute
authorized
police
as
part
of
the
stop
and
frisk
to
put
a
man
in
the
police
car
and
take
him
to
the
police
station?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
isn't
there
a
case
in
new
york
to
that
affect
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
on
the
way
to
the
station,
they
opened
his
briefcase
and
searched
it
for
a
weapon
or
whatever
they
were
looking
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent
meant
for
--
in
what
manner
rather
and
for
how
long
do
you
consider
a
detention
would
be
constitutional
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
this
statute
would
not
apply
unless
the
man
was
moving?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
the
police
officer
was
going
along
taking
care
of
his
business
late
at
night
and
he
saw
a
man
crouching
behind
in
an
alley
behind
a
telegraph
pole
or
something
like
that,
under
suspicious
circumstances,
would
you
say
that
this
ordinance
didn't
apply
to
him
just
because
he
wasn't
moving?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
if
this
was
only
to
stop
them
and
if
they
were
moving
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let
me
ask
you
this.
you
know
there
have
been
suggestions
that
when
they
stop
them
and
frisk
them
that
they
can
hold
them
for,
well
some
people
say
eight
hours,
some
people
say
four,
some
reduce
it
down
to
20
minutes
in
order
i
suppose
to
do
what
you
call
detaining
him
in
order
to
clarify
the
situation.
now
do
you
believe
any
such
theory
is
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
under
this
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
would
you
say
that
they
could
detain
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
care
about
the
american
law
institute,
i
know
what
they
say.
what
are
you
contending
in
this
court,
that
they
have
the
power
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
conceive
any
situation
where
there
is
less
than
probable
cause
to
take
the
suspect
to
the
station
and
put
him
in
the
cellar,
in
custody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
your
contention
is
that
he
can
take
him
right
there
or
can
he
take
him
into
custody
or
take
him
around
the
city
to,
say
the
scene
of
the
crimes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
rush
had
been
the
other
way?
suppose
they
had
taken
the
suspect
across
the
city
for
people
to
look
at
him
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
suspect
can
be
sequestered
as
well
in
police
car
with
two
or
three
police
officers
and
he
can't
be
in
the
station,
can't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
to
the
extent
of
abandoning
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
relaxed
in
the
opinion
of
the
police?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
the
peters
case
again
--
but
in
the
peters
case
was
the
officer
in
danger
of
his
life?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
has
to
chase
the
man
down
two
flights
of
stairs
to
frisk
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
--
that
officer
did
act
reasonably
in
the
circumstances,
he
didn't
even
act
with
probable
cause,
but
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
absolutely
this
stop-and-frisk
ordinance
was
limited
to
instances
where
the
officer
thought
his
life
was
in
danger.
now
in
this
case,
in
the
peters
case,
he
walked
out
of
--
these
men
were
tiptoeing
along
the
hall
and
he
opened
his
door
and
banged
it
and
when
they
heard
the
bang
they
ran,
and
ran
down
to
couple
of
flights
of
stairs
and
he
chased
them
and
caught
them.
now,
in
applying
the
stop-and-frisk
law
you
have
to
say
that
officer
did
that
because
he
thought
his
life
was
in
danger,
would
you,
wasn't,
didn't
he
do
that
because
he
thought
these
men
were
burglars
and
he
detained
them
because
he
thought
they
were
burglars.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
isn't
that
a
question
of
probable
cause.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
reasonableness
of
frisk,
under
our
constitution
is
been
said
to
be
probable
cause,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
you
may
respond
if
you
wish
to
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
74
--
i
suggest
you
do
that
very
properly
because
we're
in
a
longtime
schedule,
it's
been
two,
three
days,
if
you
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
it
type
written
instead
of
printed
if
you
wish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
74
john
francis
peters
versus
new
york.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
interrupt
just
a
moment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
there
a
little
more
to
the
facts
on
that,
didn't
he
say
that
as
soon
as
he
came
--
when
he
came
out
of
his
door,
he
slammed
the
door
deliberately
to
see
what
affect
it
would
have
on
them
and
when
they
heard
that
slamming
of
the
door,
they
ran,
ran
downstairs,
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
might
still
have
thought
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
i'd
like
to
refer
back
to
the
strange
situation
that
mr.
justice
black
was
put
to
you
because
i
want
to
know
how
far
you
want
us
to
go
in
this
case.
you
recall
what
it
was,
when
the
man
was
caught
in
the
alley
and
so
forth.
now,
i
wonder
if
there
is
an
element
in
the
case
that
we
haven't
yet
discussed.
the
question
you've
discussed,
the
question
of
whether
you
had
the
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
man
had
committed
a
crime
or
was
about
to
commit
a
crime
and
you
thought
that
there
was
not
and
therefore
he
didn't
have
the
right
to
stop
him
and
frisk
him.
i
wanted
to
ask
this
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
i
suppose
you
will
agree
that
a
police
officer
has
the
right
of
self-preservation
when
he's
in
a
dangerous
situation,
being
in
the
dark
alley,
below
with
a
man
under
very
suspicious
circumstances
in
the
morning
and
the
man
who
has
no
explanation
and
will
give
no
explanation.
i
wonder
if
the
officer
before
he
leaves
that
man,
doesn't
have
the
right.
if
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
might
be
injured
by
the
bullet
firing
on
him
or
throwing
a
knife
on
him
because
he
--
i
wonder
if
he
wouldn't
have
probable
cause
in
that
sense
to
frisk
the
man
to
see
if
he
had
a
weapon
and
if
we
shouldn't
put
that
element
into
the
case
also
if
--
in
other
words
i'm
asking
you
even
the
court,
if
the
court
should
agree
with
you
to
the
extent
that
we
can't
do
this,
they
can't
stop
and
frisk
him
on
suspicion
whether
if
somebody
considers
its
reasonable,
whether
police
officer
considers
it
reasonable
or
not,
if
were
the
police
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
his
life
is
in
danger,
in
his
investigative
process,
if
he
does
not
have
the
right
to
find
out
if
the
person
from
whom
the
danger
might
come,
is
armed
and
in
a
position
to
inflict
that
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
do
but
what
i'm
mean
is
this.
there
might
be
one
set
of
facts,
it
would
be
probable
–
would
constitute
probable
cause
or
would
not
constitute
probable
cause
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
event.
there
might
be
another
set
of
facts
or
the
same
set
of
facts
might
be
sufficient
to
constitute
probable
cause
so
far
as
the
officer's
safety
is
concerned
and
if
those
two
--
if
those
two
shouldn't
be
accommodated
in
these
kind
of
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
are
arguing
that
that
under
no
circumstances
can
–
can
these
–
can
an
officer
see
a
person
has
a
weapon
unless
he
has
probable
cause
for
believing
that
a
crime
has
actually
been
committed.
now
i
am
wondering
if
an
officer
can't
be
in
certain
circumstances
where
he
might
not
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
crime
has
been
committed,
but
he
does
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
might
be
seriously
injured
or
killed
if
he
doesn't
take
some
precaution.
and
i
am
asking
you
if
you
want
to
force
us
to
the
point
where
we
say
that
even
if
he
does
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
will
be
killed
or
injured
that
he
cannot,
cannot
go
over
to
a
man
to
find
out
whether
he
has
a
weapon
with
which
he
would
--
with
which
he
could
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
another
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
am
not
disagreeing
there,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
counsel
for
the
state
agreed
that
this
ordinance
could
only
be
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
protect
his
own
life.
now
i
just
won't
agree.
now
that
being
true
i
am
just
asking
you
if
there
aren't
some
circumstances
where
an
officer
confronts
a
person
without
probable
cause
for
believing
that
he
has
committed
a
crime.
but
before
he
leaves,
he
has
reasonable
grounds;
probable
cause
for
believing
that
he
might
get
killed
or
injured
if
he
doesn't
find
out
if
the
person
has
a
weapon
like
that
man
is
poking
in
the
alley,
that
justice
black
was
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
you
are
shifting
your
ground,
because
you
told
justice
black
that
he
didn't
have
and
therefore
he
couldn't
decide
and
therefore
he
couldn't
arrest
him.
you
tell
us
also
that
this
is
an
arrest
to
go
over
and
to
find
out
if
he
has
weapon
and
i
want
to
find
out
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
your
argument
seems
to
me
has
gone
beyond
the
sibron
case
and
has
gone
beyond
this
case,
we
are
on
right
now
and
you
want
us
to
state
a
general
rule
that
prevents
the
police
from
doing
these
things
under
any
circumstances.
if
that
is
your
argument,
i
was
just
trying
to
find
out
if
you
could
go
to
that
extreme?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
in
these
two
cases
the
man
who
made
the
arrest
sibron,
and
in
this
peters
case
the
man
who
made
the
arrest
obviously
was
not
in
fear
of
his
life
at
the
time
he
went
after
these
people.
they're
either
probable
cause
cases
or
there
are
no
cases
over
here.
i
don't
see
where
stop
and
frisk
law
applies
except
that
the
new
york
court
said
that
it
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duggan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
whether
this
search
in
peters
was
not
progressed
in
search
on
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
your
standard
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
is
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duggan,
didn't
your
court
through
the
opinion
of
judge
keating
equate
this
reasonable
suspicion
to
the
intuitive
sense
of
a
police
officer
who
had
been
trained
for
years
both
to
the
schools
and
in
his
work
to
suspect
people,
crime
and
so
forth?
didn't
he
equate
that
reasonable
suspicion
to
the
intuitive
sense
of
a
police
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
trouble
is
there
is
this
judicial
supervision
that
you
speak
of
in
the
normal
case.
the
police
officers
could
stop
and
frisk,
hundreds
of
people
in
the
day
but
maybe
only
one
of
them
where
they
found
a
gun
or
found
a
sort
of
burglars
tools
of
something
of
that
kind,
and
that
would
be
the
only
case
of
whatever
been
in
the
court.
the
other
hundreds
of
people
who
are
stopped
and
frisked,
nothing
has
found
and
where
many
of
them
are
innocent
people,
never
will
reach
the
courts
unless
you
have
a
suit
for
damages
or
of
threats
some
thing
of
that
kind
and
i
think
it's
almost
impossible
to
find
a
situation
where
the
police
are
curtailed
in
anyway
by
such
actions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
if
the
police
refused
to
follow
the
judgments
of
courts,
we
won't
have
very
high
standards
of
law
enforcement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
fine
minutes
more
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
for
your
convenience
now?[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
63,
nelson
sibron,
appellant
versus
new
york.
mr.
finkel
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
on
the
other
hand
if
--
would
like
to
have
us
reverse
this
case
regardless
of
how
he
comes
out?[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
simply
because
decide
all
these
hypotheticals
when
we
have
a,
when
we
have
a
case
here,
the
facts
clearly
before
us
and
the
question
is
whether
the
conviction
is
to
view
course
to
whether
it
isn't
that
i
understand
of
mr.
terry
confesses
error
on
why
should
we
have
to
deal
with
all
these
hypotheticals
in
this
case
it
may,
there
will
be
that
in
another
cases
we're
going
to
have
to
do
this,
i
wouldn't
doubt
that,
but
in
this
case
why
should
we
have
to
hear
all
of
this,
why
don't
you
hear
with
the
other
side
going
to
say
and
if
they
don't
get
your
man
off
then
you
might
have
another
situation,
but
they're
going
to,
they're
going
to
let
you
win
the
case
through
their
confession
of
error,
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
why
we
should
take
the
time
to
argue
the
rest
of
this,
in
this
case,
now
there
are
three
cases
here
maybe
in
some
of
the
others
but
they
don't
confess
error,
they
might
have
a
different
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
speak
a
little
louder,
its
hard
for
me
to
hear.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
be
satisfied
with
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
finkel
may
i
ask
you
at
the
trial
of
the
case
is
that,
if
the
police
rely
on
this
statute
under
right,
under
this
statute
–-
chief
justice
earl
warren
–
to
search
this
man
or
did
they
content
that
they
had
probable
cause.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
didn't
and
it
was
raised
in
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
court
didn't
put
it
on
the
basis,
they
put
on
the
basis
did
they
not
put,
the
police
had
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
i
understand
even
in
the
state
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
oberman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
siegel
we
have
no
objection
to
you
arguing
in
the
peters
case,
provided
it
doesn't
have
any
time
to
the
argument.[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
peters
case
is
summary
calender
case
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
don't
want
to
add
any
time
to
the
argument.
you
have
a
little
time
from
him,
it's
perfectly
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
nelson
sibron,
appellant
versus
new
york.
mr.
juviler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
if
the
peters
case
was
tried
on
theory
that
there
was
a
stop
and
frisk?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
a
rationale
of
the
case,
was
it,
not
arrest
for
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
your
argument
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
understanding
to
say
that
the
state
can
rely
first
on
arresting
a
man
for
probable
cause
and
if
they
failed
in
that
that,
they
can
fall
back
to
the
stop
and
frisk
law
and
rely
on
that
because
well
they
didn't
have
probable
cause
they
did
have
reasonable
suspicion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
have
two
bites
at
it.
the
first
you
can
try
--
first
you
can
try
a
probable
cause
and
if
it
fails
in
the
constitutional
sense,
you
can
then
fall
back
on
your
stop
and
frisk
law
and
say
well
at
all
events
we
are
entitled
to
stop
and
frisk
him
and
justify
the
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
problem.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
if
in
this
sibron
case
the
officer
had
reasonable
suspicion
that
this
man
was
carrying
narcotics,
not
probable
cause
for
doing
so
and
had
proceeded
as
he
proceeded
here,
will
the
case
be
relieved
of
error?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
distinguish
the
sibron
case
from
the
stop-and-frisk
law
because
in
sibron
case,
they
not
only
said
they
were
looking
for
weapons
but
they
actually
took
other
things
from
him
and
convicted
him
on
that
score?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
does
the
frisk
end?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
your
concept
of
this
statute
authorized
police
as
part
of
the
stop
and
frisk
to
put
a
man
in
the
police
car
and
take
him
to
the
police
station?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
isn't
there
a
case
in
new
york
to
that
affect
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
on
the
way
to
the
station,
they
opened
his
briefcase
and
searched
it
for
a
weapon
or
whatever
they
were
looking
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent
meant
for
--
in
what
manner
rather
and
for
how
long
do
you
consider
a
detention
would
be
constitutional
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
this
statute
would
not
apply
unless
the
man
was
moving?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
the
police
officer
was
going
along
taking
care
of
his
business
late
at
night
and
he
saw
a
man
crouching
behind
in
an
alley
behind
a
telegraph
pole
or
something
like
that,
under
suspicious
circumstances,
would
you
say
that
this
ordinance
didn't
apply
to
him
just
because
he
wasn't
moving?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
if
this
was
only
to
stop
them
and
if
they
were
moving
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let
me
ask
you
this.
you
know
there
have
been
suggestions
that
when
they
stop
them
and
frisk
them
that
they
can
hold
them
for,
well
some
people
say
eight
hours,
some
people
say
four,
some
reduce
it
down
to
20
minutes
in
order
i
suppose
to
do
what
you
call
detaining
him
in
order
to
clarify
the
situation.
now
do
you
believe
any
such
theory
is
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
under
this
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
would
you
say
that
they
could
detain
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
care
about
the
american
law
institute,
i
know
what
they
say.
what
are
you
contending
in
this
court,
that
they
have
the
power
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
conceive
any
situation
where
there
is
less
than
probable
cause
to
take
the
suspect
to
the
station
and
put
him
in
the
cellar,
in
custody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
your
contention
is
that
he
can
take
him
right
there
or
can
he
take
him
into
custody
or
take
him
around
the
city
to,
say
the
scene
of
the
crimes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
rush
had
been
the
other
way?
suppose
they
had
taken
the
suspect
across
the
city
for
people
to
look
at
him
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
suspect
can
be
sequestered
as
well
in
police
car
with
two
or
three
police
officers
and
he
can't
be
in
the
station,
can't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
to
the
extent
of
abandoning
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
relaxed
in
the
opinion
of
the
police?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
the
peters
case
again
--
but
in
the
peters
case
was
the
officer
in
danger
of
his
life?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
has
to
chase
the
man
down
two
flights
of
stairs
to
frisk
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
--
that
officer
did
act
reasonably
in
the
circumstances,
he
didn't
even
act
with
probable
cause,
but
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
absolutely
this
stop-and-frisk
ordinance
was
limited
to
instances
where
the
officer
thought
his
life
was
in
danger.
now
in
this
case,
in
the
peters
case,
he
walked
out
of
--
these
men
were
tiptoeing
along
the
hall
and
he
opened
his
door
and
banged
it
and
when
they
heard
the
bang
they
ran,
and
ran
down
to
couple
of
flights
of
stairs
and
he
chased
them
and
caught
them.
now,
in
applying
the
stop-and-frisk
law
you
have
to
say
that
officer
did
that
because
he
thought
his
life
was
in
danger,
would
you,
wasn't,
didn't
he
do
that
because
he
thought
these
men
were
burglars
and
he
detained
them
because
he
thought
they
were
burglars.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
isn't
that
a
question
of
probable
cause.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
reasonableness
of
frisk,
under
our
constitution
is
been
said
to
be
probable
cause,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
you
may
respond
if
you
wish
to
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
74
--
i
suggest
you
do
that
very
properly
because
we're
in
a
longtime
schedule,
it's
been
two,
three
days,
if
you
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
it
type
written
instead
of
printed
if
you
wish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
74
john
francis
peters
versus
new
york.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
interrupt
just
a
moment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
there
a
little
more
to
the
facts
on
that,
didn't
he
say
that
as
soon
as
he
came
--
when
he
came
out
of
his
door,
he
slammed
the
door
deliberately
to
see
what
affect
it
would
have
on
them
and
when
they
heard
that
slamming
of
the
door,
they
ran,
ran
downstairs,
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
might
still
have
thought
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
i'd
like
to
refer
back
to
the
strange
situation
that
mr.
justice
black
was
put
to
you
because
i
want
to
know
how
far
you
want
us
to
go
in
this
case.
you
recall
what
it
was,
when
the
man
was
caught
in
the
alley
and
so
forth.
now,
i
wonder
if
there
is
an
element
in
the
case
that
we
haven't
yet
discussed.
the
question
you've
discussed,
the
question
of
whether
you
had
the
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
man
had
committed
a
crime
or
was
about
to
commit
a
crime
and
you
thought
that
there
was
not
and
therefore
he
didn't
have
the
right
to
stop
him
and
frisk
him.
i
wanted
to
ask
this
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
i
suppose
you
will
agree
that
a
police
officer
has
the
right
of
self-preservation
when
he's
in
a
dangerous
situation,
being
in
the
dark
alley,
below
with
a
man
under
very
suspicious
circumstances
in
the
morning
and
the
man
who
has
no
explanation
and
will
give
no
explanation.
i
wonder
if
the
officer
before
he
leaves
that
man,
doesn't
have
the
right.
if
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
might
be
injured
by
the
bullet
firing
on
him
or
throwing
a
knife
on
him
because
he
--
i
wonder
if
he
wouldn't
have
probable
cause
in
that
sense
to
frisk
the
man
to
see
if
he
had
a
weapon
and
if
we
shouldn't
put
that
element
into
the
case
also
if
--
in
other
words
i'm
asking
you
even
the
court,
if
the
court
should
agree
with
you
to
the
extent
that
we
can't
do
this,
they
can't
stop
and
frisk
him
on
suspicion
whether
if
somebody
considers
its
reasonable,
whether
police
officer
considers
it
reasonable
or
not,
if
were
the
police
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
his
life
is
in
danger,
in
his
investigative
process,
if
he
does
not
have
the
right
to
find
out
if
the
person
from
whom
the
danger
might
come,
is
armed
and
in
a
position
to
inflict
that
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
do
but
what
i'm
mean
is
this.
there
might
be
one
set
of
facts,
it
would
be
probable
–
would
constitute
probable
cause
or
would
not
constitute
probable
cause
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
event.
there
might
be
another
set
of
facts
or
the
same
set
of
facts
might
be
sufficient
to
constitute
probable
cause
so
far
as
the
officer's
safety
is
concerned
and
if
those
two
--
if
those
two
shouldn't
be
accommodated
in
these
kind
of
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
are
arguing
that
that
under
no
circumstances
can
–
can
these
–
can
an
officer
see
a
person
has
a
weapon
unless
he
has
probable
cause
for
believing
that
a
crime
has
actually
been
committed.
now
i
am
wondering
if
an
officer
can't
be
in
certain
circumstances
where
he
might
not
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
crime
has
been
committed,
but
he
does
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
might
be
seriously
injured
or
killed
if
he
doesn't
take
some
precaution.
and
i
am
asking
you
if
you
want
to
force
us
to
the
point
where
we
say
that
even
if
he
does
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
will
be
killed
or
injured
that
he
cannot,
cannot
go
over
to
a
man
to
find
out
whether
he
has
a
weapon
with
which
he
would
--
with
which
he
could
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
another
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
am
not
disagreeing
there,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
counsel
for
the
state
agreed
that
this
ordinance
could
only
be
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
protect
his
own
life.
now
i
just
won't
agree.
now
that
being
true
i
am
just
asking
you
if
there
aren't
some
circumstances
where
an
officer
confronts
a
person
without
probable
cause
for
believing
that
he
has
committed
a
crime.
but
before
he
leaves,
he
has
reasonable
grounds;
probable
cause
for
believing
that
he
might
get
killed
or
injured
if
he
doesn't
find
out
if
the
person
has
a
weapon
like
that
man
is
poking
in
the
alley,
that
justice
black
was
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
you
are
shifting
your
ground,
because
you
told
justice
black
that
he
didn't
have
and
therefore
he
couldn't
decide
and
therefore
he
couldn't
arrest
him.
you
tell
us
also
that
this
is
an
arrest
to
go
over
and
to
find
out
if
he
has
weapon
and
i
want
to
find
out
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
your
argument
seems
to
me
has
gone
beyond
the
sibron
case
and
has
gone
beyond
this
case,
we
are
on
right
now
and
you
want
us
to
state
a
general
rule
that
prevents
the
police
from
doing
these
things
under
any
circumstances.
if
that
is
your
argument,
i
was
just
trying
to
find
out
if
you
could
go
to
that
extreme?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
in
these
two
cases
the
man
who
made
the
arrest
sibron,
and
in
this
peters
case
the
man
who
made
the
arrest
obviously
was
not
in
fear
of
his
life
at
the
time
he
went
after
these
people.
they're
either
probable
cause
cases
or
there
are
no
cases
over
here.
i
don't
see
where
stop
and
frisk
law
applies
except
that
the
new
york
court
said
that
it
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duggan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
whether
this
search
in
peters
was
not
progressed
in
search
on
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
your
standard
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
is
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duggan,
didn't
your
court
through
the
opinion
of
judge
keating
equate
this
reasonable
suspicion
to
the
intuitive
sense
of
a
police
officer
who
had
been
trained
for
years
both
to
the
schools
and
in
his
work
to
suspect
people,
crime
and
so
forth?
didn't
he
equate
that
reasonable
suspicion
to
the
intuitive
sense
of
a
police
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
trouble
is
there
is
this
judicial
supervision
that
you
speak
of
in
the
normal
case.
the
police
officers
could
stop
and
frisk,
hundreds
of
people
in
the
day
but
maybe
only
one
of
them
where
they
found
a
gun
or
found
a
sort
of
burglars
tools
of
something
of
that
kind,
and
that
would
be
the
only
case
of
whatever
been
in
the
court.
the
other
hundreds
of
people
who
are
stopped
and
frisked,
nothing
has
found
and
where
many
of
them
are
innocent
people,
never
will
reach
the
courts
unless
you
have
a
suit
for
damages
or
of
threats
some
thing
of
that
kind
and
i
think
it's
almost
impossible
to
find
a
situation
where
the
police
are
curtailed
in
anyway
by
such
actions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
if
the
police
refused
to
follow
the
judgments
of
courts,
we
won't
have
very
high
standards
of
law
enforcement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
fine
minutes
more
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
for
your
convenience
now?[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
