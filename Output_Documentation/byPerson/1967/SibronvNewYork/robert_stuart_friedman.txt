mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
may
it
please
the
court,
this
cause
is
before
the
court
today
on
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals,
which
judgment
confirmed
the
defendant's
conviction
for
the
illegal
possession
of
burglar's
tools.
on
this
appeal,
the
defendant
contends
that
a
certain
search
of
this
person
and
the
seizure
of
evidence
there
from
constituted
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
of
his
person
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
in
this
case,
as
in
the
sibron
case,
the
validity
of
a
state
statute,
namely
section
180
(a)
of
the
new
york
code
of
criminal
procedure
has
been
drawn
into
question.
additionally
there
have
been
raised
in
this
case
broad
questions,
which
concern
the
rights
of
our
citizenry
to
move
about
freely
without
undue
police
interference.
may
i
briefly
set
forth
the
factual
material,
underlying
the
events
in
this
case?
the
appellant
was
arrested
in
the
city
of
mount
vernon
in
new
york
on
july
10,
1964
at
or
about
1
pm
on
that
day
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
lasky
who
at
that
time
was
a
police
officer
attached
to
the
police
department
of
the
city
of
new
york.
on
a
preliminary
hearing
in
the
city
of
mount
vernon,
officer
lasky
testified
that
at
the
time
in
question
he
resided
in
the
six-floor
apartment
of
a
very
large
multiple
dwelling,
located
in
the
city
of
mount
vernon
and
that
approximately
at
1
pm
on
that
day
he
had
finished
taking
a
shower,
or
he
was
in
the
process
of
taking
a
shower,
when
he
heard
some
noise
outside
of
his
apartment
door.
he
testified
that
he
went
to
the
peephole
of
his
apartment
door,
looked
out
and
then
he
saw
two
men
whom
he
did
not
recognize,
tiptoeing
to
the
common
hallway
of
the
premises.
then
his
testimony
was
that
he
made
a
telephone
call
and
that
he
put
some
clothing
on,
again
looked
through
the
peephole
of
the
door,
saw
these
two
men
in
the
common
hallway
tiptoeing
and
that
he
left
his
apartment
with
his
drawn
service
revolver
in
hand.
and
then
he
heard
the
two
men
descending
the
staircase,
common
stairway
of
the
building
and
he
pursued
them
and
that
he
apprehended
the
defendant
at
a
point
midway
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
floor
landings
of
the
common
stairway
of
the
premises.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
my
recollection
of
the
testimony
mr.
chief
justice
is
somewhat
different,
though
it
maybe
a
slight
difference.
i
don't
believe
that
he
testified
that
he
slammed
the
door
for
that
purpose.
he
may
have
testified
that
he
slammed
his
door
and
heard
them
exiting
hastily,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
done
for
that
purpose
or
that
there
was
any
testimony
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
justice
fortas
it
is
not
only
my
position,
but
it
was
the
new
york
court
of
appeals'
position
because
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
--
in
referring
to
this
case
later
on
in
the
taggart
case
when
they
summarized
all
of
their
decisions
as
to
what
had
gone
before,
they
say
that
in
20
n.y.2d
335,
that,
“and
even
in
people
v.
peters,
where
the
officer
initially
frisked
the
defendant
and
felt
something
hard,
this
court
held
that
the
officer
did
not
have
"probable
cause"
to
make
the
arrest
until
he
actually
reached
into
the
defendant's
pocket,
withdrew,
and
identified
the
burglars'
tools.”
so
this
has
been
conceded
by
the
people
and
reflects
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
additionally.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes
your
honor
because
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that
is
not
a
case
of
probable
cause.
yes
i
do
regard
it
as
not
coming
up
to
the
level
of
probable
cause,
because
in
the
first
instance
whatever
suspicions
may
have
been
in
the
police
officer's
mind,
there
is
nothing
factually
in
the
record
which
gives
rise
to
the
inference
of
the
commission
of
any
crime
or
the
imminence
of
the
commission
of
any
crime.
if
we
examine
the
totality
of
his
observations,
he
saw
two
men
tiptoeing
in
the
hallway
and
while
this
may
not
be
legitimately
normal
conduct
as
i
believe
judge
galloway
in
the
county
court
decision
denying
suppression,
i
believe
that
was
judge
galloway's
language,
“i
maintain
that
every
conduct
that
one
observes
which
is
not
perfectly
normal,
perfectly
legitimate
does
not
necessarily
give
rise
to
probable
cause.”
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
justice
marshall
i
must
say
that,
that
is
wrong
in
the
sense
that
he
testified
that
he
heard
some
noise
at
or
outside
of
his
door,
but
there
was
no
testimony
that
there
was
any
tampering
with
any
door
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
what
attracted
the
police
officer,
i
don't
know,
but
there's
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
justice
marshall
you're
quite
correct
in
the
assumption,
but
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
follows
that
there
was
any
attempt
to
tamper
with
his
door.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
correct.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
said
that
it
may
raise
suspicion,
but
it
would
embrace
probable
cause
for
the
type
of
conduct
ensued.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that
was
his
right
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
no,
your
honor
i
agree
that
he
does
have
suspicions,
but
i
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
a
crime,
that
a
crime
had
committed,
or
was
about
to
be
committed.
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
officer
lasky
grabbed
this
appellant
by
the
collar
and
dragged
him
down
half
a
flight
of
stairs
and
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
in
the
building.
he
said
that
he
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
his
girlfriend
and
upon
being
pressed
for
the
name
of
the
woman
in
question,
the
defendant
said
he
didn't
wish
to
reveal
the
name
of
the
woman
in
question
because
she
was
a
married
woman
and
that
explanation
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
explanation
is
consistent
with
tiptoeing
through
a
common
hallway
of
a
large
multiple
dwelling,
where
there
a
120
families.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
every
time
a
police
officer
doesn't
believe
an
explanation
given
by
a
person,
he
rudely
seizes
by
the
collar
at
gunpoint
that
he's
entitled
to
take
further
action
because
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that
might
very
well
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
it
might
very
well
be
possible,
but
on
the
other
hand
in
looking
at
the
problem
from
the
protection
of
our
citizenry
in
general,
the
man
might
be
a
man
who
was
not
engaged
in
any
criminal
activity
whatsoever,
so
that
if
we
accept
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
in
the
burglary
type,
[attempt
to
laughter]
if
we
accept
the
construction
of
the
statute,
given
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
without
looking
at
what
the
fruits
of
the
search
actually
did
produce
in
this
case
and
we
look
at
the
facts
which
preceded
the
search,
we
accept
a
construction
which
permits
a
police
officer
on
intuitive
hunch
or
guess
as
opposed
to
probable
cause
with
respect
to
a
commission
of
a
crime,
to
seize
the
person
probably
at
gunpoint,
search
him
without
his
consent
and
in
the
absence
of
any,
overt
act
of
criminality.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
true
the
record
does
not
reveal
preciously
what
the
sound
was
that
the
officer
heard
and
perhaps
that
is
unfortunate
that
a
record
comes
to
the
court
and
that's
--.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
at
the
door
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
may
i
say
that
in
a
situation
like
this
it
is
appellant's
contention
that
where
you
have
suspicion
which
does
not
rise
to
probable
cause
that
the
proper
police
action
and
one
which
he
does
not
even
use
the
statutory
authority
for,
could
have
consisted
very
reasonably
in
observing
what
these
two
men
were
doing
possibly
following
them
and
possibly
demanding
an
explanation
without
the
use
of
the
force
of
their
presence
in
the
building
and
if
the
purpose
was
to
deter
a
burglary,
if
that
was
his
objective
in
mind
at
that
juncture
he
would
be
have
accomplished
his
purpose,
but
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that,
that
was
his
purpose
at
all,
because
the
record
shows
that
when
he
removed
this
plastic
envelope
from
the
defendant's
pocket
it
was
an
opaque
envelope
that
was
sealed.
so
that
at
this
moment
in
time
when
you
have
the
envelope
taken
from
the
defendant
he
had
no
knowledge
as
to
the
contents
yet,
but
in
any
event
he
had
no
fear
for
his
life
because
the
defendant
had
no
hard
object
at
that
point.
at
a
later
point
in
time
the
record
shows
he
opened
up
the
envelope
in
order
to
discover
what
was
inside
of
it
which
leaves
one
to
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
the
search
of
the
appellant
was
for
the
primary
purpose
of
exploring
for
evidence.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
in
the
envelope
it
is
conceded
that
there
were
tools
to
the
commission
of
burglary.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
some
allen
wrench
and
some
picks
i
believe
were
described
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
presumably.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
would
presume
that
they
were
because
it
was
conceded
below
that
the
issue
in
this
case
dealt
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
and
seizure
vis-à-vis
was
there
probably
cause
where
we
can
see
--
where
we
contended
on
the
preliminary
motions
that
probable
cause
does
not
exist
in
this
case
and
where
the
courts
agree
that
--
new
york
courts
agree
the
probably
cause
did
not
exist
and
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
section
188
and
on
the
basis
of
case
law
having
substantial
equivalent,
substantive
equivalent
of
the
statute
and
i
refer
to
people
v.
rivera
which
is
found
in
14
n.y.2d
i
believe.
and
all
events
if
we
look
at
the
statute,
if
i
might
turn
my
directions
to
that
for
a
moment,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
courts
seek
to
substitute
a
standard
of
what
is
described
in
the
statute
as
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well
as
i
apprehend
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
as
i
apprehend
the
distinction
as
is
outlined
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
really
that
is
the
only
basis
that
i
can
have
for
an
opinion
as
to
the
meaning
of
reasonable
suspicion
as
opposed
to
probable
cause,
reasonable
suspicion
calls
for
the
intuitive
appraisal
of
a
police
officer
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
or
is
about
to
be
committed
and
in
the
words
--
exact
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
believe
it
was
judge
keating's
words
which
said
that
the
standard
of
knowledge,
the
quantum
of
knowledge
that
the
police
officer
has
at
that
juncture
when
he
entertains
a
reasonable
suspicion
is
lower
on
the
scale
of
criminal
activity
then
would
be
required
in
a
probable
cause
case
so
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
standard
which
is
less
than
probable
cause
in
a
constitutional
sense
as
we
have
known
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well
i
think
at
this
point
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
the
issue,
i
would
take
no
quarrel
with
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
how
they
construe
it.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
justice,
i
would
say
that
this
court
has
to
accept
the
construction
of
a
statute
as
it
comes
to
this
court
from
the
highest
state
court.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes
and
if
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
believe
this
court
has
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes,
but
then
we
would
be
dealing
with
the
same
quantum
of
evidence
and
knowledge
which
we
have
known
in
traditional
causes
--
in
probable
cause
cases
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
settled
for
something
less
and
its
conception
here
what
reasonable
suspicion
means
and
this
appellant
states
that
we
--
and
its
our
position
that
we
cancel
something
for
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well
i
think
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
in
every
case
judge
are
important
and
that
is
mr.
justice
are
important
and
that
is
why
i
say
in
this
particular
case
the
extent
of
force
in
the
detention
as
opposed
to
merely
stopping
somebody
and
asking
and
making
an
inquiry,
a
legitimate
inquiry
as
to
what
he
is
doing
with
any
citizen
or
any
police
officer
has
the
right
to
do
constitutes
something.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
take
the
position
of
any
citizen
can
go
up
to
another
citizen,
it
needn't
be
a
police
officer
and
ask
him
any
questions
he
wants
and
i
take
a
position
that
there
is
a
corresponding
right
on
the
citizen
to
resist
an
invasion
of
privacy
just
as
i
take
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
and
he
doesn't
have
a
right
in
my
view
additional
may
i
say
mr.
justice
to
grab
him
by
the
collar
at
gun
point.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes
i
would
think
a
police
officer
has
the
right
to
ask
a
question
to
anybody.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
no,
i
don't
think
he
has
a
right
in
the
constitutional
sense
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
would
say
that
probable
cause
is
not
needed
for
the
police
officer
to
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
would
say
that
probably
cause
is
not
needed
for
the
police
officer
to
ask
a
question.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
would
say
that
he
might
have
a
right
and
if
we
view
this
in
a
non-constitutional
sense,
but
i
would
say
that
every
person
when
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
if
i
may
count
in
terms
of
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendment
i
think
the
person
stopped
has
a
right
to
answer
--
not
to
answer
if
he
so
chooses
or
to
indicate
that
he
doesn't
want
to
answer.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
if
he
has
not
seen
or
observed
any
overt
act
of
criminality
or
the
facts
which
could
indicate
that
there
was
probably
cause
for
crime
to
be
committed
i
would
say
yes
and
the
reason
why
i
would
say
yes
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
the
reason
why
i
would
say
that
without
discussing
whether
or
not
given
facts
in
this
case,
assuming
if
the
given
facts
in
this
case
do
not
rise
to
that
level
required
for
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest,
i
would
say
that
the
citizen
should
have
a
right
to
go
about
on
without
undue
interference
and
i
don't
think
this
is
a
great
burden
to
place
on
law
enforcement.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well,
now
i
think
your
honor
has
added
certain
facts
which
may
make
it
rise
to
a
probable
cause
situation,
but
if
for
the
purposes
of
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
there
is
no
argument
with
that
mr.
justice
black,
but
the
bone
of
contention
comes
into
those
situations
where
a
police
officer
is
permitted
to
make
this
type
of
stop,
stops
somebody
who
later
turns
out
to
be
--
has
a
legitimate
right
to
be
where
he
is,
while
i
will
say
that
most
citizens
are
cooperative
with
police
enforcement,
law
enforcement
agents
and
when
asked
a
question
they
will
normally
respond
in
a
cooperative
manner.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well
if
he
had
the
same
reason
as
mr.
peters
had,
coming
for
visiting
a
woman
or
somebody
else
and
wishing
not
to
be
observed
it
would
be
a
reason,
yes.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
quite
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
black,
but
i
think
this
court
has
said
in
many
instances
that
the
fruits
of
a
search
do
not
justify
the
search
and
that
the
steps
which
--
the
steps
which
precede
a
search
must
in
their
entirety
be
legal
and
lawful
and
constitutional.
and
i
do
not
for
any
moment
hold
any
brief
for
any
man
nor
i
do
expect
the
court
who
has
burglar
tools
in
his
possession
and
i
refer
the
statement
that
judge
fold
of
the
court
of
appeals
made
when
he
dissented
in
this
case
and
talking
about
the
fact
that
peters
deserves
some
punishment
perhaps
for
possessing
burglars
tools.
judge
fold
said
“but
i
cannot
forget
that
the
rights
and
privileges
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
are
assured
to
every
individual
to
the
worst
and
the
meanest
of
men
as
well
as
to
the
best
and
the
most
upright”
and
i
submit
that
this
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
the
assumption
is
that
to
stop
a
man
unless
than
probable
cause
at
gun
point,
i
presume
as
judge
fold's
assumption,
unless
there's
probable
course
for
believing
that
he
has
committed
a
crime
or
is
about
to
commit
a
crime
on
a
standard
which
depended
upon
the
police
officer's
intuitive
reaction
to
a
situation
does
not
meet
the
constitutional
test
of
probable
cause
and
if
it
should
develop
that
from
that
search
that
yes
this
police
officer
had
a
correct
hunch
in
this
case,
that
doesn't
justify
what
the
police
officer
did
merely
because
his
hunch
was
correct
in
this
case,
what
he
did
was
wrong
even
though
imperially
he
may
have
gotten
a
good
result
by
finding
burglars
tools
on
this
man's
person
and
this
is
part
of
the
contention
that
the
appellant
raises.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
may
i
respectfully
say
that
it
is
our
view
the
evolution
of
fourth
amendment
and
the
framers
purpose,
frames
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
seeking
to
prevent
against
general
warrants
that
this
was
a
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
no
i
conceded
that,
if
i
may
develop
this
for
a
moment.
this
was
directed
against
the
type
of
indiscriminate
type
of
searches
that
might
take
place
based
upon
the
whim
and
caprice
of
people
in
authority
and
in
particularizing
the
requirements
for
a
such
a
search
by
mandating
a
requirement
of
probable
cause,
we
sought
i
believe
during
our
history
to
narrow
the
base
of
those
instances
where
the
liberties
of
people
in
general
as
opposed
to
a
particular
individual
whom
there
is
a
certain
quantum
of
evidence
to
believe
has
done
or
about
to
do
something
wrong
should
be
searched.
when
the
level
comes
to
probable
cause,
this
court
in
the
past
has
indicated
that
it's
a
reasonable
level
and
then
it
falls
below
probably
cause,
it
is
an
unreasonable
level
and
the
difficulty
with
the
standard
proposed
by
the
new
york
legislature
and
the
new
york
courts
is
that
the
interpretation
of
reasonable
suspicion
can
be
so
varied
as
to
differ
with
every
policemen
who
was
out
on
the
street
because
it
only
calls
for
an
intuitive
reaction
on
his
part
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
concedes
that
it
calls
to
less
than
probably
cause
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
has
enunciated,
it
is
saying
that
we
are
going
to
give
a
policeman
the
authority
to
stop
citizens
on
a
lesser
bases
for
but
believing
that
they
have
done
something
wrong
in
a
criminal
sense,
than
we
would
if
they
went
to
a
magistrate
and
applied
for
a
warrant
or
some
other
judicial
authority
because
we
are
going
have
to
rely
on
the
generality
of
experience
police
judgment
to
conduct
searches
and
their
judgment
and
their
reaction
to
a
situation
to
determine
reasonableness.
and
i
suggest
that
it's
just
this
is
type
of
rationale
and
it
is
just
this
type
of
evil
which
the
fourth
amendment
sought
to
protect
against,
to
interpose
a
judicial
barrier
at
a
--
with
a
definable
standard,
rather
than
leaving
to
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
myes
sir,
i
would
mr.
justice
black
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
construction
given
to
that
term
over
the
years
by
the
court.
i
think
that
the
greatest
evil,
if
we
can
isolate
for
a
moment
'a
search,
the
fruits
of
search
and
look
particularly
to
the
events
which
preceded,
if
we
say
that
we
are
going
to
justify
searches
because
in
certain
instances
a
police
officer's
hunch
is
correct
and
had
he
proved
wrong
in
this
case
what
would
the
remedy
be
in
a
civil
suit
which
might
be
largely
(inaudible).
the
cases
that
we
never
hear
about
are
the
cases
where
there
has
nothing
been
produced
because
they
never
get
to
court
and
it's
the
right
not
only
of
this
appellant,
which
of
course
i
am
primarily
concerned
with,
but
it's
the
right
of
our
citizenry
in
general,
which
we
must
concerned
with
and
the
generality
of
these
cases
are
never
heard
because
we
only
hear
about
those
cases
where
the
hunch
has
been
correct,
but
the
ambiguities
to
which
a
great
number
of
our
citizens
are
put
are
unimaginable
and
this
statute
would
broaden
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
would
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
i
would
add
that
again
there
is
no
evidence
of
this
defendant
in
this
record
checking
what
this
man
thought
and
i
think
the
record
bears
that
out.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
because
he
heard
some
noise
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
outside
of
his
door.
it
could
very
well
be
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
don't
really
recall
getting
up
to
look
judge.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well
this
was
at
1
pm.,
in
the
afternoon,
in
the
middle
of
a
july
afternoon
when
this
occurred,
not
at
night
mr.
justice
and
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
if
i
thought
that
somebody
was
meddling
with
my
door
i
might
have
done
exactly,
without
being
sure
i
might
have
--
and
i
had
some
suspicion,
i
might
have
done
what
this
police
officer
did
initially,
make
an
inquiry
to
the
local
police
or
to
observe
further
conduct
of
this
person
that
i
saw
whom
i
didn't
recognize,
but
i
would
scarcely
feel
myself
justified
in
taking
a
gun
and
physically
seizing
this
person
and
demanding
him
at
a
gun
point
what
are
you
going
in
the
building.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
if
the
fellow
had
in
fact
been
observing
doing
something
wrong
in
the
sense
that
arose
to
the
probable
cause
level,
they
could
have
arrested
him.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
at
the
very
least,
at
the
very
least,
if
we
hypothesize
for
a
moment
that
the
some
determent
action
in
demanding
of
a
man
is
--
what
it
presents
in
a
particular
area
or
is
giving
the
(inaudible)
themselves,
they
would
have
accomplished
that
irrespective,
if
you
hypothesize
that
the
man
was
going
to
commit
a
crime
and
if
we
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
if
the
man
was
not
going
to
commit
a
crime
and
he
did
nothing
illegal
and
they
just
let
him
go,
they
wouldn't
have
to
exercise
the
physical
restrain
at
gunpoint
which
was
exercised
on
this
appellant
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
but
that
fact,
and
that
fact
only
becomes
apparent
after
the
illegal
search
and
unreasonable
search
as
expressed
in
the
constitutional
sense
and
i
say
that
because
the
police
officer
guessed
correctly
in
this
case,
does
not
justify
his
actions
because
he
just
as
equally
with
respect
to
another
citizen
could
have
guessed
wrong
and
that
is
why
we
provide
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
may
i
answer
your
question
with
another
supposition,
supposing
the
man
didn't
have
burglars
tools
and
this
citizen
who
was
the
bank
clerk
grabbed
him
by
the
collar
with
the
gun,
what
about
the
citizen
rights
under
those
circumstances?
would
not
it
be
true
that
his
rights
of
privacy
and
his
rights
of
protection
under
the
fourth
amendment
would
have
been
grossly
invaded?
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
don't
know
when
this
new
york
decision
is
necessarily
true
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well,
this
police
officer
had
a
right
to
take
action
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
no,
i
don't
say
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes,
but
i
was
about
to
say
that
this
police
officer
had
a
right
to
take
action
but
not
the
sort
of
action
which
he
took
in
this
case.
he
had
a
right
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well,
may
i
say
that
in
this
particular
case
the
record
is
totally
barren
of
any
evidence
to
support
the
new
york's
statutory
requirement
that
the
police
officer
have
any
fear
for
his
life
or
limb.
absolutely
nothing
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
don't
agree
with
your
honor's
construction
of
the
facts
in
the
record
know
the
assumption
is
clear.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
if
i
saw
him
actually
trying
to
open
up
the
door
then
there's
a
situation
of
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
it
might
have
been
across,
it
might
have
been
across
the
hall
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
interesting
to
note
in
this
record
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
no,
i
am
not.[laughter]
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
facts
in
this
record
--
the
facts
in
this
record
in
the
case
indicate
that
this
officer
went
upstairs
and
found
no
evidence
of
any
tampering
with
any
doors,
the
record
so
indicates.
so
if
we're
going
to,
if
we're
going
to
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well,
if
your
honor
pleases
i
suggest
that
the
record
does
not
support
the
inference
that
this
man
was
committing
a
burglary.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
assume
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
assume
that
your
use
of
the
word
probable
cause
and
your
hypothetical
was
using
the
constitutional
sense
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
will
accept
the
proposition
mr.
chief
justice
that
probable
cause
in
every
case
differs
one
to
the
other
depending
upon
the
facts
of
a
given
case.
i
say
that
when
probable
cause
exists
in
a
constitutional
sense
for
an
officer
to
believe
that
someone's
about
to
pull
a
revolver
on
him
or
harm
with
some
of
the
barbarly
fashion
then
he
has
probable
cause
in
the
traditional
sense
for
believing
that
a
crime
is
about
to
be
committed
and
has
every
right
independent
of
a
statute
to
take
some
action.
but
here
if
you're
going
to
lower
that
to
a
lower,
to
a
lower
standard
which
has
been
interrupted
by
our
new
york
court,
a
standard
requiring
merely
the
subjective
evaluation
or
as
judge
van
voorhis
stated,
it
would
allow
searches
on
--
practically
unlimited
searches
based
upon
a
subjective
operations
of
the
police
always
to
mind
without
the
--
any
evidence
of
overt
criminality
then
you
reach
a
point
where
you
must
draw
some
objective
standard
for
determining
the
police
officer's,
the
reasonableness
of
the
police
officer's
conduct
otherwise
you
are
permitting
a
standard
which
is
unenforceable
in
terms
of
restricting
a
police
officer
from
making
a
intrusive
searches
which
violates
a
citizen's
right
of
privacy.
in
this
particular
case,
the
unworkability
of
the
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
is
clearly
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
--
if
by
no
other
fact
then
in
the
sibron
case
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
felt
there
was
reasonable
suspicion,
the
attorneys
involved
in
that
case
did
not,
and
the
kings
county
district
attorney
office
at
this
late
date
decide
that
it
did
not.
the
unworkability
and
the
harm
to
be
perceived
statute
like
that
is
in
fact
that
a
man
like
sibron
can
do
six
months
in
jail,
i
hold
no
brief
in
narcotics
people,
when
--
he
wasn't
sent
there
according
to
law.
and
if
you
are
going
to
make
exceptions
as
to
our
system
and
permit
this
type
of
incarceration
when
the
steps
preceding
it
are
not
lawful,
then
i
think
we
do
harm
and
injustice
to
our
whole
system
of
law
and
order.
in
the
final
analysis
our
citizenry
in
general
has
to
pay
the
price
for
that
diminution
in
the
protection
for
the
individual.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
suggest
that
there
might
be
as
judge
van
voorhis
suggested
a
middle
ground.
i
can
offer
the
constitutional
rationale
to
support
it
and
that
is
formulating
new
exclusionary
rules
with
respect
to
the
products
of
such
searches
as
a
deterrent
to
police
officers
making
baseless
searches
of
this
sort
which
i
believe
–
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
as
mr.
judge
van
voorhis'
situation,
but
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
protection
in
answer,
direct
answer
to
your
question
i
think
that
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
base
upon
which
we
are
going
to
allow
an
invasion
of
privacy
to
occur
should
not
be
indiscriminately
broadened
or
open
the
door
to
that
base
and
to
whatever
extent
that
we
protect
the
liberties
of
our
citizens
in
general
it
--
consistent
with
the
good
of
the
community
we
must
try
and
keep
that
phase
as
narrow
as
possible
and
as
particularized
as
possible
to
the
individual
as
opposed
to
the
generality
of
people.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
suggest
in
answer
to
your
question
that
in
those
extreme
circumstances,
you
have
a
case
which
comes
within
the
preview
of
our
traditional
probable
cause
notions
that
a
crime
is
about
to
be
committed
or
is
ensuing
because
when
a
police
officer
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
no.
in
those
situations
absent
probable
cause
in
the
traditional
sense,
he
ought
not
have
a
right
to
search
the
man
or
the
suspect
for
the
simple
reason
as
i
view
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
we
have
it
now
for
example
in
new
york.
the
unworkability
of
it
is
illustrated
that
by
decision
it
is
implied
that
in
every
case
the
police
officer
is
going
to
have
to
fear
for
his
life
because
as
judge
keating
said
the
answer
to
a
question
maybe
a
bullet.
so
if
that's
the
position,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
at
least
in
new
york
and
i
don't
hypothesize
in
what
statute
might
be
drawn
that
would
be
a
better
statute
but
at
least
in
new
york
the
situation
is
as
i
read
these
cases
that
on
every
occasion
that
a
police
officer
stops
someone,
he
has
to
frisk
him
because
--
or
search
him
because
he
presumes
that
he
is
in
danger
because
he
maybe
--
the
answer
to
the
question
may
be
a
bullet.
well
if
this
low
level
of
causation
or
search,
just
restricted
to
the
subjective
operations
of
a
police
officer's
mind
other
than
for
example
a
situation
where
there
is
a
noticeable
bulge
or
a
suspect
does
some
overt
act
where
he
reaches
into
his
pocket
and
the
police
officer
reasonably
suspects
or
has
probable
cause,
a
set
of
phrases
you
want
to
apply
that
he
is
about
to
withdraw
a
revolver
and
use
at
the
police
officer
or
a
knife,
i
think
if
you
would
hit
the
standard
as
you
have
in
new
york
my
answer
today,
my
answer
will
have
to
be
a
no.
if
they
are
more
workable,
a
more
definitive
standard
can
be
worked
out,
then
i
say
the
answer
is
a,
we
have
to
judge
in
the
light
of
requirements
for
a
constitution.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
i
am
sorry
–
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
you
asked
what
i
would
have
this
court
do
and
i
only
deal,
even
though
i
perhaps
have
gone
beyond
that
in
scope
of
my
replies
with
what
happened
to
the
appellant
peters,
and
i
only
say
that
the
police
officer's
conduct
in
this
case
went
beyond
what
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
deals
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
some
type
of
legislation
and
i
don't
suggest
that
the
new
york
legislation
is
the
answer,
might
solve
some
of
the
problems
that's
affecting
a
balance
between
the
need
for
law
enforcement
and
the
protection
of
privacy
for
the
individual.
i
am
suggesting
however
that
the
construction
given
by
the
new
york
courts
to
a
statute
and
to
the
police
officer's
action
in
this
particular
case
offends
the
individual
rights
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
may
it
please
the
court,
this
cause
is
before
the
court
today
on
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals,
which
judgment
confirmed
the
defendant's
conviction
for
the
illegal
possession
of
burglar's
tools.
on
this
appeal,
the
defendant
contends
that
a
certain
search
of
this
person
and
the
seizure
of
evidence
there
from
constituted
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
of
his
person
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
in
this
case,
as
in
the
sibron
case,
the
validity
of
a
state
statute,
namely
section
180
(a)
of
the
new
york
code
of
criminal
procedure
has
been
drawn
into
question.
additionally
there
have
been
raised
in
this
case
broad
questions,
which
concern
the
rights
of
our
citizenry
to
move
about
freely
without
undue
police
interference.
may
i
briefly
set
forth
the
factual
material,
underlying
the
events
in
this
case?
the
appellant
was
arrested
in
the
city
of
mount
vernon
in
new
york
on
july
10,
1964
at
or
about
1
pm
on
that
day
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
lasky
who
at
that
time
was
a
police
officer
attached
to
the
police
department
of
the
city
of
new
york.
on
a
preliminary
hearing
in
the
city
of
mount
vernon,
officer
lasky
testified
that
at
the
time
in
question
he
resided
in
the
six-floor
apartment
of
a
very
large
multiple
dwelling,
located
in
the
city
of
mount
vernon
and
that
approximately
at
1
pm
on
that
day
he
had
finished
taking
a
shower,
or
he
was
in
the
process
of
taking
a
shower,
when
he
heard
some
noise
outside
of
his
apartment
door.
he
testified
that
he
went
to
the
peephole
of
his
apartment
door,
looked
out
and
then
he
saw
two
men
whom
he
did
not
recognize,
tiptoeing
to
the
common
hallway
of
the
premises.
then
his
testimony
was
that
he
made
a
telephone
call
and
that
he
put
some
clothing
on,
again
looked
through
the
peephole
of
the
door,
saw
these
two
men
in
the
common
hallway
tiptoeing
and
that
he
left
his
apartment
with
his
drawn
service
revolver
in
hand.
and
then
he
heard
the
two
men
descending
the
staircase,
common
stairway
of
the
building
and
he
pursued
them
and
that
he
apprehended
the
defendant
at
a
point
midway
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
floor
landings
of
the
common
stairway
of
the
premises.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
my
recollection
of
the
testimony
mr.
chief
justice
is
somewhat
different,
though
it
maybe
a
slight
difference.
i
don't
believe
that
he
testified
that
he
slammed
the
door
for
that
purpose.
he
may
have
testified
that
he
slammed
his
door
and
heard
them
exiting
hastily,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
done
for
that
purpose
or
that
there
was
any
testimony
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
justice
fortas
it
is
not
only
my
position,
but
it
was
the
new
york
court
of
appeals'
position
because
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
--
in
referring
to
this
case
later
on
in
the
taggart
case
when
they
summarized
all
of
their
decisions
as
to
what
had
gone
before,
they
say
that
in
20
n.y.2d
335,
that,
“and
even
in
people
v.
peters,
where
the
officer
initially
frisked
the
defendant
and
felt
something
hard,
this
court
held
that
the
officer
did
not
have
"probable
cause"
to
make
the
arrest
until
he
actually
reached
into
the
defendant's
pocket,
withdrew,
and
identified
the
burglars'
tools.”
so
this
has
been
conceded
by
the
people
and
reflects
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
additionally.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes
your
honor
because
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that
is
not
a
case
of
probable
cause.
yes
i
do
regard
it
as
not
coming
up
to
the
level
of
probable
cause,
because
in
the
first
instance
whatever
suspicions
may
have
been
in
the
police
officer's
mind,
there
is
nothing
factually
in
the
record
which
gives
rise
to
the
inference
of
the
commission
of
any
crime
or
the
imminence
of
the
commission
of
any
crime.
if
we
examine
the
totality
of
his
observations,
he
saw
two
men
tiptoeing
in
the
hallway
and
while
this
may
not
be
legitimately
normal
conduct
as
i
believe
judge
galloway
in
the
county
court
decision
denying
suppression,
i
believe
that
was
judge
galloway's
language,
“i
maintain
that
every
conduct
that
one
observes
which
is
not
perfectly
normal,
perfectly
legitimate
does
not
necessarily
give
rise
to
probable
cause.”
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
justice
marshall
i
must
say
that,
that
is
wrong
in
the
sense
that
he
testified
that
he
heard
some
noise
at
or
outside
of
his
door,
but
there
was
no
testimony
that
there
was
any
tampering
with
any
door
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
what
attracted
the
police
officer,
i
don't
know,
but
there's
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
justice
marshall
you're
quite
correct
in
the
assumption,
but
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
follows
that
there
was
any
attempt
to
tamper
with
his
door.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
correct.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
said
that
it
may
raise
suspicion,
but
it
would
embrace
probable
cause
for
the
type
of
conduct
ensued.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that
was
his
right
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
no,
your
honor
i
agree
that
he
does
have
suspicions,
but
i
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
a
crime,
that
a
crime
had
committed,
or
was
about
to
be
committed.
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
officer
lasky
grabbed
this
appellant
by
the
collar
and
dragged
him
down
half
a
flight
of
stairs
and
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
in
the
building.
he
said
that
he
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
his
girlfriend
and
upon
being
pressed
for
the
name
of
the
woman
in
question,
the
defendant
said
he
didn't
wish
to
reveal
the
name
of
the
woman
in
question
because
she
was
a
married
woman
and
that
explanation
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
explanation
is
consistent
with
tiptoeing
through
a
common
hallway
of
a
large
multiple
dwelling,
where
there
a
120
families.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
every
time
a
police
officer
doesn't
believe
an
explanation
given
by
a
person,
he
rudely
seizes
by
the
collar
at
gunpoint
that
he's
entitled
to
take
further
action
because
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that
might
very
well
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
it
might
very
well
be
possible,
but
on
the
other
hand
in
looking
at
the
problem
from
the
protection
of
our
citizenry
in
general,
the
man
might
be
a
man
who
was
not
engaged
in
any
criminal
activity
whatsoever,
so
that
if
we
accept
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
in
the
burglary
type,
[attempt
to
laughter]
if
we
accept
the
construction
of
the
statute,
given
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
without
looking
at
what
the
fruits
of
the
search
actually
did
produce
in
this
case
and
we
look
at
the
facts
which
preceded
the
search,
we
accept
a
construction
which
permits
a
police
officer
on
intuitive
hunch
or
guess
as
opposed
to
probable
cause
with
respect
to
a
commission
of
a
crime,
to
seize
the
person
probably
at
gunpoint,
search
him
without
his
consent
and
in
the
absence
of
any,
overt
act
of
criminality.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
true
the
record
does
not
reveal
preciously
what
the
sound
was
that
the
officer
heard
and
perhaps
that
is
unfortunate
that
a
record
comes
to
the
court
and
that's
--.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
at
the
door
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
may
i
say
that
in
a
situation
like
this
it
is
appellant's
contention
that
where
you
have
suspicion
which
does
not
rise
to
probable
cause
that
the
proper
police
action
and
one
which
he
does
not
even
use
the
statutory
authority
for,
could
have
consisted
very
reasonably
in
observing
what
these
two
men
were
doing
possibly
following
them
and
possibly
demanding
an
explanation
without
the
use
of
the
force
of
their
presence
in
the
building
and
if
the
purpose
was
to
deter
a
burglary,
if
that
was
his
objective
in
mind
at
that
juncture
he
would
be
have
accomplished
his
purpose,
but
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that,
that
was
his
purpose
at
all,
because
the
record
shows
that
when
he
removed
this
plastic
envelope
from
the
defendant's
pocket
it
was
an
opaque
envelope
that
was
sealed.
so
that
at
this
moment
in
time
when
you
have
the
envelope
taken
from
the
defendant
he
had
no
knowledge
as
to
the
contents
yet,
but
in
any
event
he
had
no
fear
for
his
life
because
the
defendant
had
no
hard
object
at
that
point.
at
a
later
point
in
time
the
record
shows
he
opened
up
the
envelope
in
order
to
discover
what
was
inside
of
it
which
leaves
one
to
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
the
search
of
the
appellant
was
for
the
primary
purpose
of
exploring
for
evidence.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
in
the
envelope
it
is
conceded
that
there
were
tools
to
the
commission
of
burglary.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
some
allen
wrench
and
some
picks
i
believe
were
described
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
presumably.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
would
presume
that
they
were
because
it
was
conceded
below
that
the
issue
in
this
case
dealt
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
and
seizure
vis-à-vis
was
there
probably
cause
where
we
can
see
--
where
we
contended
on
the
preliminary
motions
that
probable
cause
does
not
exist
in
this
case
and
where
the
courts
agree
that
--
new
york
courts
agree
the
probably
cause
did
not
exist
and
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
section
188
and
on
the
basis
of
case
law
having
substantial
equivalent,
substantive
equivalent
of
the
statute
and
i
refer
to
people
v.
rivera
which
is
found
in
14
n.y.2d
i
believe.
and
all
events
if
we
look
at
the
statute,
if
i
might
turn
my
directions
to
that
for
a
moment,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
courts
seek
to
substitute
a
standard
of
what
is
described
in
the
statute
as
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well
as
i
apprehend
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
as
i
apprehend
the
distinction
as
is
outlined
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
really
that
is
the
only
basis
that
i
can
have
for
an
opinion
as
to
the
meaning
of
reasonable
suspicion
as
opposed
to
probable
cause,
reasonable
suspicion
calls
for
the
intuitive
appraisal
of
a
police
officer
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
or
is
about
to
be
committed
and
in
the
words
--
exact
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
believe
it
was
judge
keating's
words
which
said
that
the
standard
of
knowledge,
the
quantum
of
knowledge
that
the
police
officer
has
at
that
juncture
when
he
entertains
a
reasonable
suspicion
is
lower
on
the
scale
of
criminal
activity
then
would
be
required
in
a
probable
cause
case
so
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
standard
which
is
less
than
probable
cause
in
a
constitutional
sense
as
we
have
known
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well
i
think
at
this
point
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
the
issue,
i
would
take
no
quarrel
with
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
how
they
construe
it.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
justice,
i
would
say
that
this
court
has
to
accept
the
construction
of
a
statute
as
it
comes
to
this
court
from
the
highest
state
court.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes
and
if
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
believe
this
court
has
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes,
but
then
we
would
be
dealing
with
the
same
quantum
of
evidence
and
knowledge
which
we
have
known
in
traditional
causes
--
in
probable
cause
cases
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
settled
for
something
less
and
its
conception
here
what
reasonable
suspicion
means
and
this
appellant
states
that
we
--
and
its
our
position
that
we
cancel
something
for
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well
i
think
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
in
every
case
judge
are
important
and
that
is
mr.
justice
are
important
and
that
is
why
i
say
in
this
particular
case
the
extent
of
force
in
the
detention
as
opposed
to
merely
stopping
somebody
and
asking
and
making
an
inquiry,
a
legitimate
inquiry
as
to
what
he
is
doing
with
any
citizen
or
any
police
officer
has
the
right
to
do
constitutes
something.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
take
the
position
of
any
citizen
can
go
up
to
another
citizen,
it
needn't
be
a
police
officer
and
ask
him
any
questions
he
wants
and
i
take
a
position
that
there
is
a
corresponding
right
on
the
citizen
to
resist
an
invasion
of
privacy
just
as
i
take
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
and
he
doesn't
have
a
right
in
my
view
additional
may
i
say
mr.
justice
to
grab
him
by
the
collar
at
gun
point.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes
i
would
think
a
police
officer
has
the
right
to
ask
a
question
to
anybody.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
no,
i
don't
think
he
has
a
right
in
the
constitutional
sense
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
would
say
that
probable
cause
is
not
needed
for
the
police
officer
to
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
would
say
that
probably
cause
is
not
needed
for
the
police
officer
to
ask
a
question.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
would
say
that
he
might
have
a
right
and
if
we
view
this
in
a
non-constitutional
sense,
but
i
would
say
that
every
person
when
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
if
i
may
count
in
terms
of
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendment
i
think
the
person
stopped
has
a
right
to
answer
--
not
to
answer
if
he
so
chooses
or
to
indicate
that
he
doesn't
want
to
answer.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
if
he
has
not
seen
or
observed
any
overt
act
of
criminality
or
the
facts
which
could
indicate
that
there
was
probably
cause
for
crime
to
be
committed
i
would
say
yes
and
the
reason
why
i
would
say
yes
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
the
reason
why
i
would
say
that
without
discussing
whether
or
not
given
facts
in
this
case,
assuming
if
the
given
facts
in
this
case
do
not
rise
to
that
level
required
for
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest,
i
would
say
that
the
citizen
should
have
a
right
to
go
about
on
without
undue
interference
and
i
don't
think
this
is
a
great
burden
to
place
on
law
enforcement.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well,
now
i
think
your
honor
has
added
certain
facts
which
may
make
it
rise
to
a
probable
cause
situation,
but
if
for
the
purposes
of
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
there
is
no
argument
with
that
mr.
justice
black,
but
the
bone
of
contention
comes
into
those
situations
where
a
police
officer
is
permitted
to
make
this
type
of
stop,
stops
somebody
who
later
turns
out
to
be
--
has
a
legitimate
right
to
be
where
he
is,
while
i
will
say
that
most
citizens
are
cooperative
with
police
enforcement,
law
enforcement
agents
and
when
asked
a
question
they
will
normally
respond
in
a
cooperative
manner.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well
if
he
had
the
same
reason
as
mr.
peters
had,
coming
for
visiting
a
woman
or
somebody
else
and
wishing
not
to
be
observed
it
would
be
a
reason,
yes.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
quite
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
black,
but
i
think
this
court
has
said
in
many
instances
that
the
fruits
of
a
search
do
not
justify
the
search
and
that
the
steps
which
--
the
steps
which
precede
a
search
must
in
their
entirety
be
legal
and
lawful
and
constitutional.
and
i
do
not
for
any
moment
hold
any
brief
for
any
man
nor
i
do
expect
the
court
who
has
burglar
tools
in
his
possession
and
i
refer
the
statement
that
judge
fold
of
the
court
of
appeals
made
when
he
dissented
in
this
case
and
talking
about
the
fact
that
peters
deserves
some
punishment
perhaps
for
possessing
burglars
tools.
judge
fold
said
“but
i
cannot
forget
that
the
rights
and
privileges
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
are
assured
to
every
individual
to
the
worst
and
the
meanest
of
men
as
well
as
to
the
best
and
the
most
upright”
and
i
submit
that
this
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
the
assumption
is
that
to
stop
a
man
unless
than
probable
cause
at
gun
point,
i
presume
as
judge
fold's
assumption,
unless
there's
probable
course
for
believing
that
he
has
committed
a
crime
or
is
about
to
commit
a
crime
on
a
standard
which
depended
upon
the
police
officer's
intuitive
reaction
to
a
situation
does
not
meet
the
constitutional
test
of
probable
cause
and
if
it
should
develop
that
from
that
search
that
yes
this
police
officer
had
a
correct
hunch
in
this
case,
that
doesn't
justify
what
the
police
officer
did
merely
because
his
hunch
was
correct
in
this
case,
what
he
did
was
wrong
even
though
imperially
he
may
have
gotten
a
good
result
by
finding
burglars
tools
on
this
man's
person
and
this
is
part
of
the
contention
that
the
appellant
raises.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
may
i
respectfully
say
that
it
is
our
view
the
evolution
of
fourth
amendment
and
the
framers
purpose,
frames
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
seeking
to
prevent
against
general
warrants
that
this
was
a
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
no
i
conceded
that,
if
i
may
develop
this
for
a
moment.
this
was
directed
against
the
type
of
indiscriminate
type
of
searches
that
might
take
place
based
upon
the
whim
and
caprice
of
people
in
authority
and
in
particularizing
the
requirements
for
a
such
a
search
by
mandating
a
requirement
of
probable
cause,
we
sought
i
believe
during
our
history
to
narrow
the
base
of
those
instances
where
the
liberties
of
people
in
general
as
opposed
to
a
particular
individual
whom
there
is
a
certain
quantum
of
evidence
to
believe
has
done
or
about
to
do
something
wrong
should
be
searched.
when
the
level
comes
to
probable
cause,
this
court
in
the
past
has
indicated
that
it's
a
reasonable
level
and
then
it
falls
below
probably
cause,
it
is
an
unreasonable
level
and
the
difficulty
with
the
standard
proposed
by
the
new
york
legislature
and
the
new
york
courts
is
that
the
interpretation
of
reasonable
suspicion
can
be
so
varied
as
to
differ
with
every
policemen
who
was
out
on
the
street
because
it
only
calls
for
an
intuitive
reaction
on
his
part
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
concedes
that
it
calls
to
less
than
probably
cause
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
has
enunciated,
it
is
saying
that
we
are
going
to
give
a
policeman
the
authority
to
stop
citizens
on
a
lesser
bases
for
but
believing
that
they
have
done
something
wrong
in
a
criminal
sense,
than
we
would
if
they
went
to
a
magistrate
and
applied
for
a
warrant
or
some
other
judicial
authority
because
we
are
going
have
to
rely
on
the
generality
of
experience
police
judgment
to
conduct
searches
and
their
judgment
and
their
reaction
to
a
situation
to
determine
reasonableness.
and
i
suggest
that
it's
just
this
is
type
of
rationale
and
it
is
just
this
type
of
evil
which
the
fourth
amendment
sought
to
protect
against,
to
interpose
a
judicial
barrier
at
a
--
with
a
definable
standard,
rather
than
leaving
to
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
myes
sir,
i
would
mr.
justice
black
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
construction
given
to
that
term
over
the
years
by
the
court.
i
think
that
the
greatest
evil,
if
we
can
isolate
for
a
moment
'a
search,
the
fruits
of
search
and
look
particularly
to
the
events
which
preceded,
if
we
say
that
we
are
going
to
justify
searches
because
in
certain
instances
a
police
officer's
hunch
is
correct
and
had
he
proved
wrong
in
this
case
what
would
the
remedy
be
in
a
civil
suit
which
might
be
largely
(inaudible).
the
cases
that
we
never
hear
about
are
the
cases
where
there
has
nothing
been
produced
because
they
never
get
to
court
and
it's
the
right
not
only
of
this
appellant,
which
of
course
i
am
primarily
concerned
with,
but
it's
the
right
of
our
citizenry
in
general,
which
we
must
concerned
with
and
the
generality
of
these
cases
are
never
heard
because
we
only
hear
about
those
cases
where
the
hunch
has
been
correct,
but
the
ambiguities
to
which
a
great
number
of
our
citizens
are
put
are
unimaginable
and
this
statute
would
broaden
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
would
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
i
would
add
that
again
there
is
no
evidence
of
this
defendant
in
this
record
checking
what
this
man
thought
and
i
think
the
record
bears
that
out.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
because
he
heard
some
noise
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
outside
of
his
door.
it
could
very
well
be
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
don't
really
recall
getting
up
to
look
judge.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well
this
was
at
1
pm.,
in
the
afternoon,
in
the
middle
of
a
july
afternoon
when
this
occurred,
not
at
night
mr.
justice
and
the
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
if
i
thought
that
somebody
was
meddling
with
my
door
i
might
have
done
exactly,
without
being
sure
i
might
have
--
and
i
had
some
suspicion,
i
might
have
done
what
this
police
officer
did
initially,
make
an
inquiry
to
the
local
police
or
to
observe
further
conduct
of
this
person
that
i
saw
whom
i
didn't
recognize,
but
i
would
scarcely
feel
myself
justified
in
taking
a
gun
and
physically
seizing
this
person
and
demanding
him
at
a
gun
point
what
are
you
going
in
the
building.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
if
the
fellow
had
in
fact
been
observing
doing
something
wrong
in
the
sense
that
arose
to
the
probable
cause
level,
they
could
have
arrested
him.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
at
the
very
least,
at
the
very
least,
if
we
hypothesize
for
a
moment
that
the
some
determent
action
in
demanding
of
a
man
is
--
what
it
presents
in
a
particular
area
or
is
giving
the
(inaudible)
themselves,
they
would
have
accomplished
that
irrespective,
if
you
hypothesize
that
the
man
was
going
to
commit
a
crime
and
if
we
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
if
the
man
was
not
going
to
commit
a
crime
and
he
did
nothing
illegal
and
they
just
let
him
go,
they
wouldn't
have
to
exercise
the
physical
restrain
at
gunpoint
which
was
exercised
on
this
appellant
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
but
that
fact,
and
that
fact
only
becomes
apparent
after
the
illegal
search
and
unreasonable
search
as
expressed
in
the
constitutional
sense
and
i
say
that
because
the
police
officer
guessed
correctly
in
this
case,
does
not
justify
his
actions
because
he
just
as
equally
with
respect
to
another
citizen
could
have
guessed
wrong
and
that
is
why
we
provide
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
may
i
answer
your
question
with
another
supposition,
supposing
the
man
didn't
have
burglars
tools
and
this
citizen
who
was
the
bank
clerk
grabbed
him
by
the
collar
with
the
gun,
what
about
the
citizen
rights
under
those
circumstances?
would
not
it
be
true
that
his
rights
of
privacy
and
his
rights
of
protection
under
the
fourth
amendment
would
have
been
grossly
invaded?
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
don't
know
when
this
new
york
decision
is
necessarily
true
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well,
this
police
officer
had
a
right
to
take
action
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
no,
i
don't
say
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
yes,
but
i
was
about
to
say
that
this
police
officer
had
a
right
to
take
action
but
not
the
sort
of
action
which
he
took
in
this
case.
he
had
a
right
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well,
may
i
say
that
in
this
particular
case
the
record
is
totally
barren
of
any
evidence
to
support
the
new
york's
statutory
requirement
that
the
police
officer
have
any
fear
for
his
life
or
limb.
absolutely
nothing
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
don't
agree
with
your
honor's
construction
of
the
facts
in
the
record
know
the
assumption
is
clear.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
if
i
saw
him
actually
trying
to
open
up
the
door
then
there's
a
situation
of
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
it
might
have
been
across,
it
might
have
been
across
the
hall
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
interesting
to
note
in
this
record
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
no,
i
am
not.[laughter]
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
facts
in
this
record
--
the
facts
in
this
record
in
the
case
indicate
that
this
officer
went
upstairs
and
found
no
evidence
of
any
tampering
with
any
doors,
the
record
so
indicates.
so
if
we're
going
to,
if
we're
going
to
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
well,
if
your
honor
pleases
i
suggest
that
the
record
does
not
support
the
inference
that
this
man
was
committing
a
burglary.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
assume
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
assume
that
your
use
of
the
word
probable
cause
and
your
hypothetical
was
using
the
constitutional
sense
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
will
accept
the
proposition
mr.
chief
justice
that
probable
cause
in
every
case
differs
one
to
the
other
depending
upon
the
facts
of
a
given
case.
i
say
that
when
probable
cause
exists
in
a
constitutional
sense
for
an
officer
to
believe
that
someone's
about
to
pull
a
revolver
on
him
or
harm
with
some
of
the
barbarly
fashion
then
he
has
probable
cause
in
the
traditional
sense
for
believing
that
a
crime
is
about
to
be
committed
and
has
every
right
independent
of
a
statute
to
take
some
action.
but
here
if
you're
going
to
lower
that
to
a
lower,
to
a
lower
standard
which
has
been
interrupted
by
our
new
york
court,
a
standard
requiring
merely
the
subjective
evaluation
or
as
judge
van
voorhis
stated,
it
would
allow
searches
on
--
practically
unlimited
searches
based
upon
a
subjective
operations
of
the
police
always
to
mind
without
the
--
any
evidence
of
overt
criminality
then
you
reach
a
point
where
you
must
draw
some
objective
standard
for
determining
the
police
officer's,
the
reasonableness
of
the
police
officer's
conduct
otherwise
you
are
permitting
a
standard
which
is
unenforceable
in
terms
of
restricting
a
police
officer
from
making
a
intrusive
searches
which
violates
a
citizen's
right
of
privacy.
in
this
particular
case,
the
unworkability
of
the
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
is
clearly
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
--
if
by
no
other
fact
then
in
the
sibron
case
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
felt
there
was
reasonable
suspicion,
the
attorneys
involved
in
that
case
did
not,
and
the
kings
county
district
attorney
office
at
this
late
date
decide
that
it
did
not.
the
unworkability
and
the
harm
to
be
perceived
statute
like
that
is
in
fact
that
a
man
like
sibron
can
do
six
months
in
jail,
i
hold
no
brief
in
narcotics
people,
when
--
he
wasn't
sent
there
according
to
law.
and
if
you
are
going
to
make
exceptions
as
to
our
system
and
permit
this
type
of
incarceration
when
the
steps
preceding
it
are
not
lawful,
then
i
think
we
do
harm
and
injustice
to
our
whole
system
of
law
and
order.
in
the
final
analysis
our
citizenry
in
general
has
to
pay
the
price
for
that
diminution
in
the
protection
for
the
individual.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
suggest
that
there
might
be
as
judge
van
voorhis
suggested
a
middle
ground.
i
can
offer
the
constitutional
rationale
to
support
it
and
that
is
formulating
new
exclusionary
rules
with
respect
to
the
products
of
such
searches
as
a
deterrent
to
police
officers
making
baseless
searches
of
this
sort
which
i
believe
–
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
as
mr.
judge
van
voorhis'
situation,
but
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
protection
in
answer,
direct
answer
to
your
question
i
think
that
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
base
upon
which
we
are
going
to
allow
an
invasion
of
privacy
to
occur
should
not
be
indiscriminately
broadened
or
open
the
door
to
that
base
and
to
whatever
extent
that
we
protect
the
liberties
of
our
citizens
in
general
it
--
consistent
with
the
good
of
the
community
we
must
try
and
keep
that
phase
as
narrow
as
possible
and
as
particularized
as
possible
to
the
individual
as
opposed
to
the
generality
of
people.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
i
suggest
in
answer
to
your
question
that
in
those
extreme
circumstances,
you
have
a
case
which
comes
within
the
preview
of
our
traditional
probable
cause
notions
that
a
crime
is
about
to
be
committed
or
is
ensuing
because
when
a
police
officer
--
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
no.
in
those
situations
absent
probable
cause
in
the
traditional
sense,
he
ought
not
have
a
right
to
search
the
man
or
the
suspect
for
the
simple
reason
as
i
view
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
we
have
it
now
for
example
in
new
york.
the
unworkability
of
it
is
illustrated
that
by
decision
it
is
implied
that
in
every
case
the
police
officer
is
going
to
have
to
fear
for
his
life
because
as
judge
keating
said
the
answer
to
a
question
maybe
a
bullet.
so
if
that's
the
position,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
at
least
in
new
york
and
i
don't
hypothesize
in
what
statute
might
be
drawn
that
would
be
a
better
statute
but
at
least
in
new
york
the
situation
is
as
i
read
these
cases
that
on
every
occasion
that
a
police
officer
stops
someone,
he
has
to
frisk
him
because
--
or
search
him
because
he
presumes
that
he
is
in
danger
because
he
maybe
--
the
answer
to
the
question
may
be
a
bullet.
well
if
this
low
level
of
causation
or
search,
just
restricted
to
the
subjective
operations
of
a
police
officer's
mind
other
than
for
example
a
situation
where
there
is
a
noticeable
bulge
or
a
suspect
does
some
overt
act
where
he
reaches
into
his
pocket
and
the
police
officer
reasonably
suspects
or
has
probable
cause,
a
set
of
phrases
you
want
to
apply
that
he
is
about
to
withdraw
a
revolver
and
use
at
the
police
officer
or
a
knife,
i
think
if
you
would
hit
the
standard
as
you
have
in
new
york
my
answer
today,
my
answer
will
have
to
be
a
no.
if
they
are
more
workable,
a
more
definitive
standard
can
be
worked
out,
then
i
say
the
answer
is
a,
we
have
to
judge
in
the
light
of
requirements
for
a
constitution.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
i
am
sorry
–
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
you
asked
what
i
would
have
this
court
do
and
i
only
deal,
even
though
i
perhaps
have
gone
beyond
that
in
scope
of
my
replies
with
what
happened
to
the
appellant
peters,
and
i
only
say
that
the
police
officer's
conduct
in
this
case
went
beyond
what
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
deals
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
some
type
of
legislation
and
i
don't
suggest
that
the
new
york
legislation
is
the
answer,
might
solve
some
of
the
problems
that's
affecting
a
balance
between
the
need
for
law
enforcement
and
the
protection
of
privacy
for
the
individual.
i
am
suggesting
however
that
the
construction
given
by
the
new
york
courts
to
a
statute
and
to
the
police
officer's
action
in
this
particular
case
offends
the
individual
rights
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting.
mr.
robert
stuart
friedman
thank
you
sir.
