mr.
michael
juviler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
new
york
county
district
attorney's
office
appears
as
amicus
curiae
in
both
the
sibron
case
number
63
and
the
peters
number
74.
time
for
oral
argument
has
been
made
available
to
us
from
the
time
allotted
to
the
sibron
case.
the
interest
of
amicus
as
a
prosecutor
in
a
major
crime
infested
city
is
in
preserving
the
constitutionality
of
the
police
patrol
practices
of
long
standing,
which
have
been
codified
in
the
new
york
stop
and
frisk
statute,
the
statute
that
is
under
attack
in
both
the
sibron
and
the
peters
case.
whether
the
question
is
reached
in
the
sibron
case
as
mr.
justice
white
noted
yesterday
it
must
be
passed
in
the
peters
case,
if
it
is
not
reached
in
the
sibron
case
and
the
issues
therefore
as
well
as
the
interests
of
amicus
survive
the
unusual
procedural
features
of
the
sibron
case.
we
propose
to
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yeah
i
believe
it
was
your
honor
from
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
as
to
his
conduct.
mr.
michael
juviler
there
actually
was
no
express
finding
by
the
hearing
court,
but
on
a
motion
to
suppress
the
district
attorney
of
westchester
county
took
the
position
that
this
was
a
lawful
application
of
the
stop
and
frisk
statute.
he
did
not
seek
to
justify
the
officer's
conduct
on
the
theory
of
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
juviler
that
is
our
argument
here
your
honor.
mr.
michael
juviler
no
mr.
justice
we
agree
with
that
concession
of
error.
mr.
michael
juviler
on
the
basis
that
the
officer
lacked
reasonable
grounds
to
suspect
that
the
defendant
sibron
was
behaving
in
a
suspicious
manner.
mr.
michael
juviler
we
join
with
mr.
siegel
in
contending
that
this
officer
was
not
really
applying
the
stop
and
frisk
statute
at
all
as
was
clear
from
his
testimony
and
that
the
stop
and
frisk
statute
did
not
apply
to
the
conduct.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
we
do
not.
mr.
michael
juviler
that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes
that
is
our
position
mr.
justice.
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
juviler
which
is
–
may
i
--
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
would
have
thought
not
mr.
justice
marshall
until
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
the
peters
case.
mr.
michael
juviler
we
would
have
to
construe
the
peters
case
that
way,
however.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
--
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
as
a
practical
matter
that
is
not
a
real
problem
in
new
york
state.
mr.
michael
juviler
he
undoubtedly
did
have
a
right
except
that
--
we
feel
that
probable
cause
did
not
attach
until
at
the
very
least
he
felt
the
hard
object
in
peter's
pocket.
mr.
michael
juviler
he
had
probable
cause
to
stop
him
not--
mr.
michael
juviler
question
him
and
detain
him
if
necessary
to
determine
what
the
purpose
of
this
suspect
was.
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
michael
juviler
because
i
think
probable
cause
has
been
used
in
two
senses.
in
one
sense,
its
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
specific
person
has
committed
a
crime
and
that
is
the
standard,
which
justifies
actually
taking
the
suspect
to
the
station
house
and
booking
him
for
burglary.
i
think
perhaps
in
that
sense
there
was
no
probable
cause
at
that
moment.
however
probable
cause
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
the
camara
case
in
the
last
term
in
this
court
does
not
always
mean
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
particular
person
has
committed
a
crime.
mr.
michael
juviler
he
had
reasonable
suspicion
that
what
he
did
was
reasonable.
mr.
michael
juviler
precisely,
and
if
the
label
of
probable
cause
to
detain
is
placed
on
this
rather
than
reasonable
suspicion,
we
would
quite
agree
that
under
either
label,
what
the
officer
did
was
reasonable,
it
was
quite
reasonable.
mr.
michael
juviler
only
if
the
facts
fail
to
show
probable
cause
for
an
actual
arrest
and
booking
of
the
suspect
as
the
appellants
urge
in
these
cases.
mr.
michael
juviler
if
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
mr.
peters
at
the
time
the
officer
opened
his
door
was
attempting
a
burglary
then
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
as
a
general
practice
mr.
chief
justice,
the
officer
relies
first
on
the
stop
and
frisk
powers
and
only
subsequently
on
the
arrest
powers.
there
are
undoubtedly
borderline
cases
where
in
a
close
case,
perhaps
peters
is
such
a
case
the
quantum
of
evidence
does
not
establish
probable
cause
for
arrest,
probable
cause
to
believe
and
yet
under
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
what
the
officer
did
was
reasonable
as
that
term
is
employed
in
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
michael
juviler
if
the
standards
of
the
statute
are
met.
i
think
that
what
your
honor
suggesting
is
nothing
new
in
the
law
of
fourth
amendment.
there
are
cases
where
an
officer
will
execute
a
warrant
which
subsequently
proves
to
have
been
based
on
insufficient
cause
in
the
officer's
affidavit
and
yet
in
the
course
of
the
officer's
subsequent
investigation
and
execution
of
the
warrant,
he
develops
in
a
lawful
manner
probable
cause
for
arrest.
now
while
the
principle,
impetus
historically
for
that
officer's
conduct
may
have
been
probable
cause,
this
court
has
held
--
may
have
in
the
warrant,
this
court
has
held
that
if
the
warrant
does
not
meet
the
tests
of
probable
cause
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
officer
can,
as
your
honor
suggests,
fall
back
and
i
see
nothing
unreasonable
about
this
under
the
fourth
amendment,
so
long
as
what
the
officer
did
was
reasonable
and
fulfills
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
juviler
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
it
is,
unless
the
officer
has
deliberately
delayed
the
arrest
for
some
unworthy
purpose
such
as
waiting
for
the
suspect
to
get
to
his
home,
so
that
he
can
use
the
arrest
as
an
excuse
for
searching
the
home,
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
not
because
based
on
the
findings
of
the
hearing
court
as
expressed
in
its
colloquy
with
counsel,
the
court
found
that
the
officer's
purpose
in
reaching
for
mr.
sibron's
pocket
was
not
self-protection,
but
rather
to
seize
an
object
that
perhaps
the
suspect
was
going
to
throw
to
the
ground
and
we
do
not
feel
that
such
an
action
is
reasonable.
however,
i
think
there
perhaps
could
be
unusual
circumstances
not
raised
in
any
of
the
cases
presently
before
the
court
where
a
sudden
movement
by
a
person
detained
in
a
suspicious
circumstances,
a
man
who's
been
observed
on
tenement
roof
as
the
case
we
cited
our
brief
from
the
new
york
files,
who
was
moving
from
roof
to
roof
late
at
night
and
the
officer
goes
up
to
the
tenement
roof
and
stops
him
and
suddenly
the
man
makes
an
action
towards
breast
pocket,
i
think
there
it
would
be
reasonable
to
eschew
in
the
particular
case,
the
external
padding
to
prevent
the
additional
danger
to
the
officer,
but
that
is
not
in
any
of
the
cases
presently
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
juviler
they
took
them
mr.
chief
justice
in
a
manner
that
was
not
reasonable.
we
do
not
feel
that
only
weapons
maybe
admitted
in
evidence
if
the
officer's
maneuver
that
discovers
something
other
than
a
weapon
was
legitimately
and
reasonably
a
frisk
for
a
weapon.
but
the
sibron
case
has
even
further
problems
than
that.
the
sibron
case,
i
think
it's
clear,
does
not
square
with
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
the
stop-and-frisk
statute
as
expressed
in
its
actual
written-in
opinions,
and
we
propose
to
address
ourselves
to
the
actual
degree
of
intrusion
that
the
stop-and-frisk
statute
does
permit
and
to
compare
that
to
the
constitutional
standards
for
reasonable
searches
and
seizures.
the
first,
actually
the
basic
provision
in
this
statute
is
not
the
frisk.
it's
an
accident
of
jurisprudence
that
the
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court
this
week
have
all
involved
discovery
of
tangible
objects.
as
the
briefs
of
the
national
district
attorneys
association
makes
clear,
they
have
an
appendix
with
sample
cases
of
detention,
the
average
case
that
have
come
to
the
attention
of
the
lower
courts
and
of
this
court
on
petitions
for
certiorari,
are
cases
where
there's
merely
a
stop,
a
questioning
and
a
detention
and
this
is
really
the
heart
of
the
stop
provision.
the
frisk
is
merely
an
adjunct
to
this
more
essential
part
of
the
stop-and-frisk
theory
which
has
been
codified
after
long
practice
in
the
new
york
statute.
mr.
michael
juviler
the
frisk
ends
when
the
officer
determines
either
by
this
patting
--
either
by
this
padding
that
there
are
no
grounds
to
suspect
that
there
is
a
weapon,
i
pat
myself
here
it's
quite
obvious
that
that's
the
case
or
when
a
potential
dangerous
weapon
such
as
a
gun
or
a
gravity
knife,
a
hard
object
is
felt,
the
officer
then
of
course
in
all
humanity
is
entitled
to
examine
internally
only
that
specific
region
of
the
suspect's
person.
now
while
the
statute
uses
the
word
“search”
it
has
been
narrowly
construed
in
judge
keating's
opinion
in
the
peters
case
to
cover
only
this
patting,
your
honors
that
--
mr.
michael
juviler
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
juviler
the
taggart
case
expressly
reaffirms
the
holding
of
the
peters
case
without
taking
time
to
read
the
relevant
portion
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
that's
correct
mr.
justice,
unless
there's
an
extraordinary
circumstance
such
as
the
court
felt
existed
in
the
taggart
case.
now,
we
may
different
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
specific
fact
situations
as
to
what
the
extraordinary
circumstances
are.
there,
there
was
specific
information
relating
to
a
specific
weapon
at
a
particular
part
of
the
suspect's
person.
there
was
a
crowd
of
children
around
the
suspect.
now
perhaps,
it
could
be
argued
both
way
that
this
is
not
dangerous
enough
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
it
is
a
search.
mr.
michael
juviler
in
the
generics
--
mr.
michael
juviler
stop
and
detention
is
a
seizure.
mr.
michael
juviler
it
is
a
seizure
that
is
not
unreasonable
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
standard
--
mr.
michael
juviler
and
a
search
that
is
not
unreasonable.
mr.
michael
juviler
precisely
because
the
standards,
for
reason
--
for
intrusion
of
particular
types
that
are
cognizable
under
the
fourth
amendment
vary
from
case
to
case.
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear
that
the
standards
are
flexible,
depending
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
intrusion,
the
degree
of
intrusion
and
it's
the
degree
of
intrusion
is
proportioned
as
it
is
in
the
stop-frisk-theory
to
the
degree
of
knowledge
that
the
officer
has
and
this
is
a
reasonable
search.
i
think
the
camara
case
made
that
quite
clear.
mr.
michael
juviler
not
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
–
mr.
michael
juviler
the
(inaudible)
case
to
which
your
honor
refers
was
decided
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
enactment
of
the
stop-and-frisk
bill.
the
stop-and-frisk
statute
says
that
the
officer
may
search
the
person.
now
that
has
been,
that
has
been
construed
by
the
police
department
and
by
the
law
enforcement
agencies
which
prepared
guidelines,
interpreting
this
law,
same
agencies
that
sponsored
the
law
that
has
been
construed
as
not
including
opening
a
briefcase
or
a
ladies
handbag.
these
are
items
which
reasonably
can
be
taken
from
the
suspect
during
the
detention
and
placed
out
of
reach.
we
do
not
urge
that
opening
those
items
is
necessary
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
so
hold
now
at
least
that
is
unsettled
in
new
york
law
since
the
passage
of
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
will
depend
upon
the
facts
of
the
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
has
stated
in
the
peters
case
that
the
detention
is
for
a
short
and
reasonable
period.
they
have
not
had
occasion
to
apply
that
interpretation
to
specific
cases
other
than
the
peter's
case
itself,
which
i
think
is
illustrative
of
a
detention.
we
have
to
be
frank.
this
is
a
detention
that
is
reasonable.
the
officer
caught
a
suspected
burglar
on
a
landing
after
running
after
the
burglar
ran
down
a
flight
and
half
of
stairs.
it
was
reasonable
for
him
to
make
a
brief
detention
in
order
to
return
the
suspect
to
the
scene
of
the
suspected
crime
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
i
am
arguing
the
peters
case
because
that's
correct
your
honor.
to
return
mr.
peters
to
the
scene
of
the
crime,
to
determine
whether
indeed
the
suspicions
were
correct,
whether
there
had
been
signs
of
a
break
in
the
apartment
opposite,
whether
the
door
opposite
had
forced
open.
there
are
typical
cases
from
actual
occurrences
in
the
new
york
city,
which
illustrate
this.
we
cite
several
in
our
brief.
the
lady
whose
handbag
has
been
snatched,
who
tells
an
officer
on
the
corner
that
a
young
man
or
two
young
man
have
run
north
with
a
handbag.
the
officer
sees
a
young
man
running
two
blocks
north.
now
he
can't
take
that
young
man
to
the
station
house
and
book
him
for
a
grand
larceny.
he
doesn't
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
book,
but
its
perfectly
reasonable
for
him
to
make
a
brief
detention
in
order
enable
a
quick
confrontation
between
the
suspect
and
the
--
mr.
michael
juviler
in
this
instance
he
could
ask
questions,
i
am
not
sure
what
purpose
--
mr.
michael
juviler
the
miranda
question
--
i
think
the
miranda
case,
which
is
written
so
precisely,
left
the
door
open
to
certain
stop-and-frisk
situations
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
it
is
a
custody,
but
not
necessarily
mr.
justice
brennan
a
custody
for
purposes
of
miranda,
because
in
the
miranda
decision,
there
was
compared
or
there
was
an
explication
of
that
term
in
same
sentence,
the
suspect
is
deprived
of
his
freedom
in
any
significant
way.
so
that
the
miranda
case
acknowledges
that
there
is
some
restraint
on
freedom,
which
is
not
sufficiently
significant
to
give
rise
to
the
miranda
warning.
mr.
michael
juviler
he
had
him
by
the
collar,
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
in
the
peters
case
[laughter]
i
think
in
the
peters
case
where
there
is
a
caller
and
a
gun
open,
it
wasn't
clear
from
the
record
whether
it
was
pointed,
but
a
gun
open,
this
is
a
brief
detention,
yet
it's
one
which
quite
reasonably
the
miranda
warnings
now
could
apply
to,
although
in
the
peters
case
that
was
not
at
issue
due
to
the
timing
of
this
case.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
in
this
extraordinary
restraint
of
freedom
to
apply
the
miranda
warning.
mr.
michael
juviler
to
the
actual
prevention
rather
than
the
apprehension.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
there
are
some
situations
where
to
prevent
crime
the
officer
must
know
or
must
make
reasonable
efforts
to
learn
the
identity
of
the
suspect.
i
think
it's
impossible
and
i
think
it
would
be
undesirable
--
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
right
to
stop
and
question.
mr.
michael
juviler
in
those
instances
there
are
with
the
--
the
detention
could
only
be
for
the
length
of
time
to
learn
the
suspect's
purpose
of
being
there.
i
think
that,
that
alone
is
limited
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
noted
yesterday,
when
an
officer
tells
someone
to
stop
and
ask
them
what
he
is
doing
and
holds
him
for
that
period,
there
is
some
degree
of
official
authority
that
is
conveyed
to
the
suspect
that
he
must
remain
there.
i
think
the
prevention
is
that
the
officer
makes
his
presence
known
specifically
addressed
to
that
suspect
and
if
he
learns
his
identity,
i
think
he
is
prevented
any
(inaudible)
crime
in
that
neighborhood
at
least
in
that
area.
mr.
michael
juviler
there
are
situations
of
that
nature
where
the
suspect
has
to
be
stopped
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
michael
juviler
we
cite
a
case
in
our
brief
that
occurred
in
new
york
where
two
men
were
running
out
of
a
bar
and
they
were
following
a
woman
who
was
running
out.
now
there
may
have
been
a
crime
here,
there
may
have
been
an
assault,
so
it's
late
at
night.
the
officer
had
to
touch,
he
had
to
detain
those
two
men
to
find
out
what
they
were
doing.
in
other
situations
where
the
man
is
right
on
the
spot,
the
only
--
mr.
michael
juviler
no
as
a
matter
of
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
michael
juviler
i
don't
think
we
need
to
stop-and-frisk
statute
in
the
strict
sense
in
new
york
for
to
preserve
this
police
comment
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
michael
juviler
an
authority
to
exercise
some
restraint.
mr.
michael
juviler
to,
in
the
one
sense
to
detain
a
suspect
for
the
length
of
time
--
mr.
michael
juviler
in
other
instances.
mr.
michael
juviler
in
other
instances
to
enable
a
confrontation
or
a
clarification
of
the
situation
that
has
arisen
and
there
are
many
ambiguous
situations
where
a
--
mr.
michael
juviler
well
it
has
been
argued
by
--
in
new
york
that
even
to
stop
someone
and
keep
him
there
while
you
are
asking
what
he
is
doing
creates
this
compulsion
which
--
mr.
michael
juviler
in
most
instances
--
in
many
instances
you
would
not
beyond
the
initial
just
asking
his
identity
and
asking
what
he
is
doing,
but
sometimes
the
suspect
may
not
--
mr.
michael
juviler
no
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
if
the
suspect
is
in
a
situation
which
appears
to
a
potential
mugging.
mr.
michael
juviler
well,
that's
the
problem.
i
don't
think
we
can
have
policeman
on
the
corner
of
every
street
in
a
high
crime
area
for
24
hours
a
day
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
desirable.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes
when
i
think
of
the
officer
--
mr.
michael
juviler
no,
not
to
make
him
answer.
mr.
michael
juviler
unless
his,
unless
the
majesty
of
his
badge
is
sufficient
he
is
not,
but
at
least
to
enforce
that
majesty
he
has
got
to
keep
the
man
where
he
is
if
he
wishes
to
leave
for
the
duration
of
time
it
takes
to
ask
him
what
he
is
doing
and
i
think
this
is
traditional
police
practice.
mr.
michael
juviler
well
i
think
that
the
more
serious
problem
is
the
detention
of
purposes
of
clarification
of
an
ambiguous
situation.
for
example
the
woman
screaming
and
a
man
coming
out
the
front
door
late
at
night
or
--
mr.
michael
juviler
it
hasn't
been
--
if
that
is
the
purpose
it
hasn't
conceded
in
the
--
mr.
michael
juviler
not
through
the
stop-and-frisk
statute.
mr.
michael
juviler
there
were
8,000
concealed
weapons
found
in
new
york
city,
concealed
guns
and
revolvers
which
point
out
the
danger
to
officers
in
the
field,
but
there
is
no
--
these
were
not
found
in
enforcement
of
the
stop-and-frisk
statute,
but
once
we
placed
an
officer
--
mr.
michael
juviler
unquestionably.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
a
table
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
showing
that
some
of
these
were
found
pursuant
to
the
stop-and-frisk
statute.
but
once
the
officer
is
in
a
situation
where
his
duty
compels
him
to
confront
an
individual
who
is
suspected
of
a
serious
crime,
it
is
our
position
that
it's
reasonable
to
touch
him,
to
see
whether
further
danger
is
required?
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
the
additional
factor
that
the
statute
makes
clear
is
that
the
policeman
can
enforce
his
ability
to
stop
someone,
by
power,
the
official
power
to
detain
the
suspect
there.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes
i
think
so
there
is
no
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
well
i
think
if
the
officer
is
going
to
do
more,
i
think
if
the
--
mr.
michael
juviler
he
doesn't
need
the
statute.
but
if
you're
walking
--
mr.
michael
juviler
if
you
are
standing
--
mr.
michael
juviler
not
at
all.
but
if
you
walking
in
times
square
and
you
resemble
a
suspect
of
a
murder
as
occurred
in
the
case
in
times
square
that
we
cite,
the
officer
has
the
power
under
the
statute
codifying
established
power
actually
to
stop
your
movement.
there
is
a
difference
i
think
--
mr.
michael
juviler
and
to
detain
him
for
purposes
of
identification
in
that
case
and
of
course
in
apprehending
mr.
justice
white,
in
apprehending
criminals
there
is
in
our
theory
some
prevention
that
is
occurring,
although
this
is
not
the
direct
effect,
but
prevention
is
not
the
only
job
of
the
patrol,
although
it
is
the
principal
job
and
i
think
as
far
as
the
detention
aspect,
the
detention
aspect
perhaps
is
more
successful
and
useful
in
actually
apprehending
people
who
are
in
ambiguous
circumstances
where
the
crime
probably
has
already
occurred.
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
correct.
it
would
not
be
a
stop.
mr.
michael
juviler
no,
the
ordinance,
in
the
statute
would
apply
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
officer
was
required
to
detain
the
person
beyond
just
asking
--
mr.
michael
juviler
i
misspoke.
that
was
ill-considered
on
my
talk.
the
statute
has
been
construed
mr.
chief
justice
now
this
term
stop
has
been
construed
as
embodied
in
the
peters
case,
as
embodying
stopping
someone
who
is
ambulatory
or
detaining
someone
where
he
is
by
the
official
power
of
the
policeman.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
now
the
statute
--
mr.
michael
juviler
the
american
law
institute
--
mr.
michael
juviler
we
are
not
proposing
any
specific
time
limit
beyond
that
which
is
reasonable.
i
think
if
it
gets
beyond
20
minutes
there
has
to
be
a
very
good
reason
for
the
continued
detention
and
in
my
examination
of
the
cases,
a
longer
detention
where
this
no
probable
cause
to
believe
is
really
not
necessary
for
law
enforcement.
i
think
that
the
ambiguous
situations
in
the
great
instance
can
be
cleared
up
as
in
the
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
in
new
york
city,
in
a
few
minutes.
now
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
depends
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
a
particular
case,
just
as
the
standard
of
an
unreasonable
delay
in
arraignment
under
the
federal
statute
is
not
a
minute
by
minute
chronology
but
something
which
has
to
be
examined.
we
would
not
--
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
instance
where
eight
hours
would
be
reasonable.
mr.
michael
juviler
none
whatsoever,
that
is
not
authorized
by
the
new
york
cases
and
new
york
law
or
in
our
position
by
the
present
interpretation
of
the
common
law
having
its
--
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
he
can
only
take
him
and
it's
only
necessary
and
proper
to
take
him
to
the
immediate
area
where
the
crime
has
occurred,
i
accept
i
can
conceive
of
one
instance
which
is
cited
in
one
of
the
briefs
in
the
appendix
to
the
national
district
attorney's
brief,
where
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
certain
automobile
had
been
engaged
in
a
known
burglary
and
it
was
seen
at
the
other
end
of
town.
now
the
officer
on
patrol
there
who
received
the
description
saw
this
car,
but
he
wasn't
present
at
the
burglary,
he
detained
the
car
and
in
a
matter
of
a
few
moments
a
witness
and
a
police
officer
from
the
scene
were
rushed
across
town
to
the
scene
and
they
established
that
this
was
the
car
and
these
were
the
people
engaged
in
the
burglary,
that
was
–
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
would
be
reasonable
as
in
the
case
of
the
purse
snatch
for
example
where
you
had
a
distraught
woman
whose
purse
was
snatched
and
she
hysterically
gave
a
description
to
the
officer,
i
think
it's
reasonable
for
the
suspect
to
be
brought
back
to
the
scene
or
the
woman
screaming
in
the
window
up
above
and
a
man
is
stopped
down
here.
i
think
that,
and
in
the
peters
case
where
the
burglary
suspect
was
brought
from
the
fifth
floor
landing
up
to
the
sixth
floor,
i
think
this
is
a
very
limited
type
of
detention
which
doesn't
include
the
handcuffs,
the
cell
bars,
the
booking
and
the
crowded
police
station
and
that
is
not
needed
and
it's
not
authorized
by
the
new
york
cases
or
the
court
of
appeals
cases
and
the
statute
in
new
york.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes
i
think
the
problem
here
is
actually
one
not
of
the
place,
but
of
the
degree
of
force
or
official
coercion
that
is
needed
and
i
think
putting
someone
in
the
police
car
its
not
so
much
where
he
is,
but
that
this
is
a
use
of
a
greater
degree
of
force
or
official
restraint
than
just
asking
him
to
remain
where
he
was,
where
he
is
while
the
radio
call
that
he
made
to
see
whether
the
car
is
stolen,
for
example.
i
think
that
is
the
traditional
police
practice.
i
think
there
is
a
certain
extent
mr.
justice
warren
where
these
cases
as
in
all
search
and
seizure
cases
under
the
fourth
amendment
have
to
be
reviewed
on
a
case
by
case
basis
deepening
on
a
facts
of
the
particular
case
and
while
there
are
always
borderline
situations
--
mr.
michael
juviler
to
the
extent
probable
cause
is
not
abandoned
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
that
in
the
established
--
mr.
michael
juviler
in
the
customary
law,
in
the
decisions
of
every
court
in
the
lower
courts
that
have
reached
this
including
the
federal
courts
and
in
the
common
law
probable
cause
to
believe
to
book
someone
and
arrest
him
is
not
required
for
a
minimal
limited
detention
of
the
type
that
is
authorized
by
the
new
york
statute.
undoubtedly,
there
will
be
cases
arising
where
the
detention
goes
beyond
those
limits
as
there
are
cases
in
every
police
rule
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
think
the
courts
and
this
court
are
well-equipped
to
point
out
to
the
police
the
true
standards
and
the
proper
boundaries
as
the
cases
arrive.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
it
is
contemplated
--
mr.
michael
juviler
he
could
not
stop
your
honor
but
he
could
stop
someone
with
--
mr.
michael
juviler
--
reasonably
suspected
of
a
serious
crime.
now,
if
your
honor,
if
the
officer
--
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
juviler
absolutely,
the
statute
is
unequivocal
in
that
respect
and
it
has
been
so
construed
in
the
peters
case.
there's
no
way
to
read
the
statute
any
other
way.
you
can't
just
go
and
ask
someone's
name
who
is
not
under
a
reasonable
suspicion
and
frisk
him,
it's
absolutely
unauthorized.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
because
the
frisk
often
is
at
the
initial
stages
--
mr.
michael
juviler
of
the
questioning
and
--
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
right.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
and
there
were
some
instances
where
--
mr.
michael
juviler
the
latter,
he
must
reasonably
suspect
that
his
life
is
or
limb
is
in
danger.
mr.
michael
juviler
that
is
the
limit.
the
statute
doesn't
authorize
a
frisk
in
every
instance
and
it
hasn't
been
despite
the
claims
that
have
been
made
at
this
court.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
so.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
it's
a
dangerous.
i
think
he
chased
him
so
that
he
could
stop
him
and
bring
him
back
to
the
scene.
i
think
he
chased
mr.
peter
so
that
he
could
stop
him
and
bring
him
back
to
the
scene
and
see
what
happen
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
expect
the
officer
to
do
that
without
making
a
very
minimal
self-protective
inquiry.
now
if
the
officer
had
been
shot
and
killed
that
would
have
been
impossible
to
balance
against
the
number
of
people
who
are
touched
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
michael
juviler
so
that's
why
he
detained
them
and
i
think
he
frisked
them
--
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
it's
a
problem
of
reasonableness.
mr.
michael
juviler
it's
probable
cause
to
believe
in
the
context
of
an
actual
arrest
and
it's
context
of
other
searches
or
intrusions,
probable
cause
can
just
mean
reasonableness
that
was
the
express
language
of
a
majority
of
this
court
in
the
camara
case.
i
think
that
the
probable
cause
standard
which
is
stated
in
the
fourth
amendment
applicable
to
warrants
is
not
designed
to
cover
every
intrusion
of
any
kind
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
so
held.
that
is
just
one
example,
singled
out
by
the
framers
because
there
was
a
particular
evil
that
was
aimed
at
that
required
the
specification
of
that
one
example
of
reasonableness.
and
whether
the
court
should
consider
this
probable
cause
or
consider
it
a
search
or
seizure
that
is
not
unreasonable.
i
think
the
ultimate
result
is
that
what
the
officer
did
in
this
case
and
many
other
cases
that
it
represents
was
reasonable
and
if
it's
reasonable
the
conduct
should
not
be
disapproved
by
the
court
and
evidence
obtained
in
this
reasonable
manner
under
traditional
rulings
is
admissible
in
court.
mr.
michael
juviler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
new
york
county
district
attorney's
office
appears
as
amicus
curiae
in
both
the
sibron
case
number
63
and
the
peters
number
74.
time
for
oral
argument
has
been
made
available
to
us
from
the
time
allotted
to
the
sibron
case.
the
interest
of
amicus
as
a
prosecutor
in
a
major
crime
infested
city
is
in
preserving
the
constitutionality
of
the
police
patrol
practices
of
long
standing,
which
have
been
codified
in
the
new
york
stop
and
frisk
statute,
the
statute
that
is
under
attack
in
both
the
sibron
and
the
peters
case.
whether
the
question
is
reached
in
the
sibron
case
as
mr.
justice
white
noted
yesterday
it
must
be
passed
in
the
peters
case,
if
it
is
not
reached
in
the
sibron
case
and
the
issues
therefore
as
well
as
the
interests
of
amicus
survive
the
unusual
procedural
features
of
the
sibron
case.
we
propose
to
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yeah
i
believe
it
was
your
honor
from
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
as
to
his
conduct.
mr.
michael
juviler
there
actually
was
no
express
finding
by
the
hearing
court,
but
on
a
motion
to
suppress
the
district
attorney
of
westchester
county
took
the
position
that
this
was
a
lawful
application
of
the
stop
and
frisk
statute.
he
did
not
seek
to
justify
the
officer's
conduct
on
the
theory
of
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
juviler
that
is
our
argument
here
your
honor.
mr.
michael
juviler
no
mr.
justice
we
agree
with
that
concession
of
error.
mr.
michael
juviler
on
the
basis
that
the
officer
lacked
reasonable
grounds
to
suspect
that
the
defendant
sibron
was
behaving
in
a
suspicious
manner.
mr.
michael
juviler
we
join
with
mr.
siegel
in
contending
that
this
officer
was
not
really
applying
the
stop
and
frisk
statute
at
all
as
was
clear
from
his
testimony
and
that
the
stop
and
frisk
statute
did
not
apply
to
the
conduct.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
we
do
not.
mr.
michael
juviler
that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes
that
is
our
position
mr.
justice.
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
juviler
which
is
–
may
i
--
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
would
have
thought
not
mr.
justice
marshall
until
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
the
peters
case.
mr.
michael
juviler
we
would
have
to
construe
the
peters
case
that
way,
however.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
--
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
as
a
practical
matter
that
is
not
a
real
problem
in
new
york
state.
mr.
michael
juviler
he
undoubtedly
did
have
a
right
except
that
--
we
feel
that
probable
cause
did
not
attach
until
at
the
very
least
he
felt
the
hard
object
in
peter's
pocket.
mr.
michael
juviler
he
had
probable
cause
to
stop
him
not--
mr.
michael
juviler
question
him
and
detain
him
if
necessary
to
determine
what
the
purpose
of
this
suspect
was.
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
michael
juviler
because
i
think
probable
cause
has
been
used
in
two
senses.
in
one
sense,
its
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
specific
person
has
committed
a
crime
and
that
is
the
standard,
which
justifies
actually
taking
the
suspect
to
the
station
house
and
booking
him
for
burglary.
i
think
perhaps
in
that
sense
there
was
no
probable
cause
at
that
moment.
however
probable
cause
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
the
camara
case
in
the
last
term
in
this
court
does
not
always
mean
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
particular
person
has
committed
a
crime.
mr.
michael
juviler
he
had
reasonable
suspicion
that
what
he
did
was
reasonable.
mr.
michael
juviler
precisely,
and
if
the
label
of
probable
cause
to
detain
is
placed
on
this
rather
than
reasonable
suspicion,
we
would
quite
agree
that
under
either
label,
what
the
officer
did
was
reasonable,
it
was
quite
reasonable.
mr.
michael
juviler
only
if
the
facts
fail
to
show
probable
cause
for
an
actual
arrest
and
booking
of
the
suspect
as
the
appellants
urge
in
these
cases.
mr.
michael
juviler
if
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
mr.
peters
at
the
time
the
officer
opened
his
door
was
attempting
a
burglary
then
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
as
a
general
practice
mr.
chief
justice,
the
officer
relies
first
on
the
stop
and
frisk
powers
and
only
subsequently
on
the
arrest
powers.
there
are
undoubtedly
borderline
cases
where
in
a
close
case,
perhaps
peters
is
such
a
case
the
quantum
of
evidence
does
not
establish
probable
cause
for
arrest,
probable
cause
to
believe
and
yet
under
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
what
the
officer
did
was
reasonable
as
that
term
is
employed
in
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
michael
juviler
if
the
standards
of
the
statute
are
met.
i
think
that
what
your
honor
suggesting
is
nothing
new
in
the
law
of
fourth
amendment.
there
are
cases
where
an
officer
will
execute
a
warrant
which
subsequently
proves
to
have
been
based
on
insufficient
cause
in
the
officer's
affidavit
and
yet
in
the
course
of
the
officer's
subsequent
investigation
and
execution
of
the
warrant,
he
develops
in
a
lawful
manner
probable
cause
for
arrest.
now
while
the
principle,
impetus
historically
for
that
officer's
conduct
may
have
been
probable
cause,
this
court
has
held
--
may
have
in
the
warrant,
this
court
has
held
that
if
the
warrant
does
not
meet
the
tests
of
probable
cause
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
officer
can,
as
your
honor
suggests,
fall
back
and
i
see
nothing
unreasonable
about
this
under
the
fourth
amendment,
so
long
as
what
the
officer
did
was
reasonable
and
fulfills
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
juviler
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
it
is,
unless
the
officer
has
deliberately
delayed
the
arrest
for
some
unworthy
purpose
such
as
waiting
for
the
suspect
to
get
to
his
home,
so
that
he
can
use
the
arrest
as
an
excuse
for
searching
the
home,
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
not
because
based
on
the
findings
of
the
hearing
court
as
expressed
in
its
colloquy
with
counsel,
the
court
found
that
the
officer's
purpose
in
reaching
for
mr.
sibron's
pocket
was
not
self-protection,
but
rather
to
seize
an
object
that
perhaps
the
suspect
was
going
to
throw
to
the
ground
and
we
do
not
feel
that
such
an
action
is
reasonable.
however,
i
think
there
perhaps
could
be
unusual
circumstances
not
raised
in
any
of
the
cases
presently
before
the
court
where
a
sudden
movement
by
a
person
detained
in
a
suspicious
circumstances,
a
man
who's
been
observed
on
tenement
roof
as
the
case
we
cited
our
brief
from
the
new
york
files,
who
was
moving
from
roof
to
roof
late
at
night
and
the
officer
goes
up
to
the
tenement
roof
and
stops
him
and
suddenly
the
man
makes
an
action
towards
breast
pocket,
i
think
there
it
would
be
reasonable
to
eschew
in
the
particular
case,
the
external
padding
to
prevent
the
additional
danger
to
the
officer,
but
that
is
not
in
any
of
the
cases
presently
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
juviler
they
took
them
mr.
chief
justice
in
a
manner
that
was
not
reasonable.
we
do
not
feel
that
only
weapons
maybe
admitted
in
evidence
if
the
officer's
maneuver
that
discovers
something
other
than
a
weapon
was
legitimately
and
reasonably
a
frisk
for
a
weapon.
but
the
sibron
case
has
even
further
problems
than
that.
the
sibron
case,
i
think
it's
clear,
does
not
square
with
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
the
stop-and-frisk
statute
as
expressed
in
its
actual
written-in
opinions,
and
we
propose
to
address
ourselves
to
the
actual
degree
of
intrusion
that
the
stop-and-frisk
statute
does
permit
and
to
compare
that
to
the
constitutional
standards
for
reasonable
searches
and
seizures.
the
first,
actually
the
basic
provision
in
this
statute
is
not
the
frisk.
it's
an
accident
of
jurisprudence
that
the
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court
this
week
have
all
involved
discovery
of
tangible
objects.
as
the
briefs
of
the
national
district
attorneys
association
makes
clear,
they
have
an
appendix
with
sample
cases
of
detention,
the
average
case
that
have
come
to
the
attention
of
the
lower
courts
and
of
this
court
on
petitions
for
certiorari,
are
cases
where
there's
merely
a
stop,
a
questioning
and
a
detention
and
this
is
really
the
heart
of
the
stop
provision.
the
frisk
is
merely
an
adjunct
to
this
more
essential
part
of
the
stop-and-frisk
theory
which
has
been
codified
after
long
practice
in
the
new
york
statute.
mr.
michael
juviler
the
frisk
ends
when
the
officer
determines
either
by
this
patting
--
either
by
this
padding
that
there
are
no
grounds
to
suspect
that
there
is
a
weapon,
i
pat
myself
here
it's
quite
obvious
that
that's
the
case
or
when
a
potential
dangerous
weapon
such
as
a
gun
or
a
gravity
knife,
a
hard
object
is
felt,
the
officer
then
of
course
in
all
humanity
is
entitled
to
examine
internally
only
that
specific
region
of
the
suspect's
person.
now
while
the
statute
uses
the
word
“search”
it
has
been
narrowly
construed
in
judge
keating's
opinion
in
the
peters
case
to
cover
only
this
patting,
your
honors
that
--
mr.
michael
juviler
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
juviler
the
taggart
case
expressly
reaffirms
the
holding
of
the
peters
case
without
taking
time
to
read
the
relevant
portion
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
that's
correct
mr.
justice,
unless
there's
an
extraordinary
circumstance
such
as
the
court
felt
existed
in
the
taggart
case.
now,
we
may
different
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
specific
fact
situations
as
to
what
the
extraordinary
circumstances
are.
there,
there
was
specific
information
relating
to
a
specific
weapon
at
a
particular
part
of
the
suspect's
person.
there
was
a
crowd
of
children
around
the
suspect.
now
perhaps,
it
could
be
argued
both
way
that
this
is
not
dangerous
enough
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
it
is
a
search.
mr.
michael
juviler
in
the
generics
--
mr.
michael
juviler
stop
and
detention
is
a
seizure.
mr.
michael
juviler
it
is
a
seizure
that
is
not
unreasonable
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
standard
--
mr.
michael
juviler
and
a
search
that
is
not
unreasonable.
mr.
michael
juviler
precisely
because
the
standards,
for
reason
--
for
intrusion
of
particular
types
that
are
cognizable
under
the
fourth
amendment
vary
from
case
to
case.
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear
that
the
standards
are
flexible,
depending
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
intrusion,
the
degree
of
intrusion
and
it's
the
degree
of
intrusion
is
proportioned
as
it
is
in
the
stop-frisk-theory
to
the
degree
of
knowledge
that
the
officer
has
and
this
is
a
reasonable
search.
i
think
the
camara
case
made
that
quite
clear.
mr.
michael
juviler
not
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
–
mr.
michael
juviler
the
(inaudible)
case
to
which
your
honor
refers
was
decided
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
enactment
of
the
stop-and-frisk
bill.
the
stop-and-frisk
statute
says
that
the
officer
may
search
the
person.
now
that
has
been,
that
has
been
construed
by
the
police
department
and
by
the
law
enforcement
agencies
which
prepared
guidelines,
interpreting
this
law,
same
agencies
that
sponsored
the
law
that
has
been
construed
as
not
including
opening
a
briefcase
or
a
ladies
handbag.
these
are
items
which
reasonably
can
be
taken
from
the
suspect
during
the
detention
and
placed
out
of
reach.
we
do
not
urge
that
opening
those
items
is
necessary
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
so
hold
now
at
least
that
is
unsettled
in
new
york
law
since
the
passage
of
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
will
depend
upon
the
facts
of
the
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
has
stated
in
the
peters
case
that
the
detention
is
for
a
short
and
reasonable
period.
they
have
not
had
occasion
to
apply
that
interpretation
to
specific
cases
other
than
the
peter's
case
itself,
which
i
think
is
illustrative
of
a
detention.
we
have
to
be
frank.
this
is
a
detention
that
is
reasonable.
the
officer
caught
a
suspected
burglar
on
a
landing
after
running
after
the
burglar
ran
down
a
flight
and
half
of
stairs.
it
was
reasonable
for
him
to
make
a
brief
detention
in
order
to
return
the
suspect
to
the
scene
of
the
suspected
crime
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
i
am
arguing
the
peters
case
because
that's
correct
your
honor.
to
return
mr.
peters
to
the
scene
of
the
crime,
to
determine
whether
indeed
the
suspicions
were
correct,
whether
there
had
been
signs
of
a
break
in
the
apartment
opposite,
whether
the
door
opposite
had
forced
open.
there
are
typical
cases
from
actual
occurrences
in
the
new
york
city,
which
illustrate
this.
we
cite
several
in
our
brief.
the
lady
whose
handbag
has
been
snatched,
who
tells
an
officer
on
the
corner
that
a
young
man
or
two
young
man
have
run
north
with
a
handbag.
the
officer
sees
a
young
man
running
two
blocks
north.
now
he
can't
take
that
young
man
to
the
station
house
and
book
him
for
a
grand
larceny.
he
doesn't
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
book,
but
its
perfectly
reasonable
for
him
to
make
a
brief
detention
in
order
enable
a
quick
confrontation
between
the
suspect
and
the
--
mr.
michael
juviler
in
this
instance
he
could
ask
questions,
i
am
not
sure
what
purpose
--
mr.
michael
juviler
the
miranda
question
--
i
think
the
miranda
case,
which
is
written
so
precisely,
left
the
door
open
to
certain
stop-and-frisk
situations
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
it
is
a
custody,
but
not
necessarily
mr.
justice
brennan
a
custody
for
purposes
of
miranda,
because
in
the
miranda
decision,
there
was
compared
or
there
was
an
explication
of
that
term
in
same
sentence,
the
suspect
is
deprived
of
his
freedom
in
any
significant
way.
so
that
the
miranda
case
acknowledges
that
there
is
some
restraint
on
freedom,
which
is
not
sufficiently
significant
to
give
rise
to
the
miranda
warning.
mr.
michael
juviler
he
had
him
by
the
collar,
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
in
the
peters
case
[laughter]
i
think
in
the
peters
case
where
there
is
a
caller
and
a
gun
open,
it
wasn't
clear
from
the
record
whether
it
was
pointed,
but
a
gun
open,
this
is
a
brief
detention,
yet
it's
one
which
quite
reasonably
the
miranda
warnings
now
could
apply
to,
although
in
the
peters
case
that
was
not
at
issue
due
to
the
timing
of
this
case.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
in
this
extraordinary
restraint
of
freedom
to
apply
the
miranda
warning.
mr.
michael
juviler
to
the
actual
prevention
rather
than
the
apprehension.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
there
are
some
situations
where
to
prevent
crime
the
officer
must
know
or
must
make
reasonable
efforts
to
learn
the
identity
of
the
suspect.
i
think
it's
impossible
and
i
think
it
would
be
undesirable
--
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
right
to
stop
and
question.
mr.
michael
juviler
in
those
instances
there
are
with
the
--
the
detention
could
only
be
for
the
length
of
time
to
learn
the
suspect's
purpose
of
being
there.
i
think
that,
that
alone
is
limited
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
noted
yesterday,
when
an
officer
tells
someone
to
stop
and
ask
them
what
he
is
doing
and
holds
him
for
that
period,
there
is
some
degree
of
official
authority
that
is
conveyed
to
the
suspect
that
he
must
remain
there.
i
think
the
prevention
is
that
the
officer
makes
his
presence
known
specifically
addressed
to
that
suspect
and
if
he
learns
his
identity,
i
think
he
is
prevented
any
(inaudible)
crime
in
that
neighborhood
at
least
in
that
area.
mr.
michael
juviler
there
are
situations
of
that
nature
where
the
suspect
has
to
be
stopped
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
michael
juviler
we
cite
a
case
in
our
brief
that
occurred
in
new
york
where
two
men
were
running
out
of
a
bar
and
they
were
following
a
woman
who
was
running
out.
now
there
may
have
been
a
crime
here,
there
may
have
been
an
assault,
so
it's
late
at
night.
the
officer
had
to
touch,
he
had
to
detain
those
two
men
to
find
out
what
they
were
doing.
in
other
situations
where
the
man
is
right
on
the
spot,
the
only
--
mr.
michael
juviler
no
as
a
matter
of
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
michael
juviler
i
don't
think
we
need
to
stop-and-frisk
statute
in
the
strict
sense
in
new
york
for
to
preserve
this
police
comment
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
michael
juviler
an
authority
to
exercise
some
restraint.
mr.
michael
juviler
to,
in
the
one
sense
to
detain
a
suspect
for
the
length
of
time
--
mr.
michael
juviler
in
other
instances.
mr.
michael
juviler
in
other
instances
to
enable
a
confrontation
or
a
clarification
of
the
situation
that
has
arisen
and
there
are
many
ambiguous
situations
where
a
--
mr.
michael
juviler
well
it
has
been
argued
by
--
in
new
york
that
even
to
stop
someone
and
keep
him
there
while
you
are
asking
what
he
is
doing
creates
this
compulsion
which
--
mr.
michael
juviler
in
most
instances
--
in
many
instances
you
would
not
beyond
the
initial
just
asking
his
identity
and
asking
what
he
is
doing,
but
sometimes
the
suspect
may
not
--
mr.
michael
juviler
no
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
if
the
suspect
is
in
a
situation
which
appears
to
a
potential
mugging.
mr.
michael
juviler
well,
that's
the
problem.
i
don't
think
we
can
have
policeman
on
the
corner
of
every
street
in
a
high
crime
area
for
24
hours
a
day
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
desirable.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes
when
i
think
of
the
officer
--
mr.
michael
juviler
no,
not
to
make
him
answer.
mr.
michael
juviler
unless
his,
unless
the
majesty
of
his
badge
is
sufficient
he
is
not,
but
at
least
to
enforce
that
majesty
he
has
got
to
keep
the
man
where
he
is
if
he
wishes
to
leave
for
the
duration
of
time
it
takes
to
ask
him
what
he
is
doing
and
i
think
this
is
traditional
police
practice.
mr.
michael
juviler
well
i
think
that
the
more
serious
problem
is
the
detention
of
purposes
of
clarification
of
an
ambiguous
situation.
for
example
the
woman
screaming
and
a
man
coming
out
the
front
door
late
at
night
or
--
mr.
michael
juviler
it
hasn't
been
--
if
that
is
the
purpose
it
hasn't
conceded
in
the
--
mr.
michael
juviler
not
through
the
stop-and-frisk
statute.
mr.
michael
juviler
there
were
8,000
concealed
weapons
found
in
new
york
city,
concealed
guns
and
revolvers
which
point
out
the
danger
to
officers
in
the
field,
but
there
is
no
--
these
were
not
found
in
enforcement
of
the
stop-and-frisk
statute,
but
once
we
placed
an
officer
--
mr.
michael
juviler
unquestionably.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
a
table
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
showing
that
some
of
these
were
found
pursuant
to
the
stop-and-frisk
statute.
but
once
the
officer
is
in
a
situation
where
his
duty
compels
him
to
confront
an
individual
who
is
suspected
of
a
serious
crime,
it
is
our
position
that
it's
reasonable
to
touch
him,
to
see
whether
further
danger
is
required?
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
the
additional
factor
that
the
statute
makes
clear
is
that
the
policeman
can
enforce
his
ability
to
stop
someone,
by
power,
the
official
power
to
detain
the
suspect
there.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes
i
think
so
there
is
no
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
well
i
think
if
the
officer
is
going
to
do
more,
i
think
if
the
--
mr.
michael
juviler
he
doesn't
need
the
statute.
but
if
you're
walking
--
mr.
michael
juviler
if
you
are
standing
--
mr.
michael
juviler
not
at
all.
but
if
you
walking
in
times
square
and
you
resemble
a
suspect
of
a
murder
as
occurred
in
the
case
in
times
square
that
we
cite,
the
officer
has
the
power
under
the
statute
codifying
established
power
actually
to
stop
your
movement.
there
is
a
difference
i
think
--
mr.
michael
juviler
and
to
detain
him
for
purposes
of
identification
in
that
case
and
of
course
in
apprehending
mr.
justice
white,
in
apprehending
criminals
there
is
in
our
theory
some
prevention
that
is
occurring,
although
this
is
not
the
direct
effect,
but
prevention
is
not
the
only
job
of
the
patrol,
although
it
is
the
principal
job
and
i
think
as
far
as
the
detention
aspect,
the
detention
aspect
perhaps
is
more
successful
and
useful
in
actually
apprehending
people
who
are
in
ambiguous
circumstances
where
the
crime
probably
has
already
occurred.
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
correct.
it
would
not
be
a
stop.
mr.
michael
juviler
no,
the
ordinance,
in
the
statute
would
apply
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
officer
was
required
to
detain
the
person
beyond
just
asking
--
mr.
michael
juviler
i
misspoke.
that
was
ill-considered
on
my
talk.
the
statute
has
been
construed
mr.
chief
justice
now
this
term
stop
has
been
construed
as
embodied
in
the
peters
case,
as
embodying
stopping
someone
who
is
ambulatory
or
detaining
someone
where
he
is
by
the
official
power
of
the
policeman.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
now
the
statute
--
mr.
michael
juviler
the
american
law
institute
--
mr.
michael
juviler
we
are
not
proposing
any
specific
time
limit
beyond
that
which
is
reasonable.
i
think
if
it
gets
beyond
20
minutes
there
has
to
be
a
very
good
reason
for
the
continued
detention
and
in
my
examination
of
the
cases,
a
longer
detention
where
this
no
probable
cause
to
believe
is
really
not
necessary
for
law
enforcement.
i
think
that
the
ambiguous
situations
in
the
great
instance
can
be
cleared
up
as
in
the
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
in
new
york
city,
in
a
few
minutes.
now
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
depends
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
a
particular
case,
just
as
the
standard
of
an
unreasonable
delay
in
arraignment
under
the
federal
statute
is
not
a
minute
by
minute
chronology
but
something
which
has
to
be
examined.
we
would
not
--
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
instance
where
eight
hours
would
be
reasonable.
mr.
michael
juviler
none
whatsoever,
that
is
not
authorized
by
the
new
york
cases
and
new
york
law
or
in
our
position
by
the
present
interpretation
of
the
common
law
having
its
--
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
he
can
only
take
him
and
it's
only
necessary
and
proper
to
take
him
to
the
immediate
area
where
the
crime
has
occurred,
i
accept
i
can
conceive
of
one
instance
which
is
cited
in
one
of
the
briefs
in
the
appendix
to
the
national
district
attorney's
brief,
where
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
certain
automobile
had
been
engaged
in
a
known
burglary
and
it
was
seen
at
the
other
end
of
town.
now
the
officer
on
patrol
there
who
received
the
description
saw
this
car,
but
he
wasn't
present
at
the
burglary,
he
detained
the
car
and
in
a
matter
of
a
few
moments
a
witness
and
a
police
officer
from
the
scene
were
rushed
across
town
to
the
scene
and
they
established
that
this
was
the
car
and
these
were
the
people
engaged
in
the
burglary,
that
was
–
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
that
would
be
reasonable
as
in
the
case
of
the
purse
snatch
for
example
where
you
had
a
distraught
woman
whose
purse
was
snatched
and
she
hysterically
gave
a
description
to
the
officer,
i
think
it's
reasonable
for
the
suspect
to
be
brought
back
to
the
scene
or
the
woman
screaming
in
the
window
up
above
and
a
man
is
stopped
down
here.
i
think
that,
and
in
the
peters
case
where
the
burglary
suspect
was
brought
from
the
fifth
floor
landing
up
to
the
sixth
floor,
i
think
this
is
a
very
limited
type
of
detention
which
doesn't
include
the
handcuffs,
the
cell
bars,
the
booking
and
the
crowded
police
station
and
that
is
not
needed
and
it's
not
authorized
by
the
new
york
cases
or
the
court
of
appeals
cases
and
the
statute
in
new
york.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes
i
think
the
problem
here
is
actually
one
not
of
the
place,
but
of
the
degree
of
force
or
official
coercion
that
is
needed
and
i
think
putting
someone
in
the
police
car
its
not
so
much
where
he
is,
but
that
this
is
a
use
of
a
greater
degree
of
force
or
official
restraint
than
just
asking
him
to
remain
where
he
was,
where
he
is
while
the
radio
call
that
he
made
to
see
whether
the
car
is
stolen,
for
example.
i
think
that
is
the
traditional
police
practice.
i
think
there
is
a
certain
extent
mr.
justice
warren
where
these
cases
as
in
all
search
and
seizure
cases
under
the
fourth
amendment
have
to
be
reviewed
on
a
case
by
case
basis
deepening
on
a
facts
of
the
particular
case
and
while
there
are
always
borderline
situations
--
mr.
michael
juviler
to
the
extent
probable
cause
is
not
abandoned
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
that
in
the
established
--
mr.
michael
juviler
in
the
customary
law,
in
the
decisions
of
every
court
in
the
lower
courts
that
have
reached
this
including
the
federal
courts
and
in
the
common
law
probable
cause
to
believe
to
book
someone
and
arrest
him
is
not
required
for
a
minimal
limited
detention
of
the
type
that
is
authorized
by
the
new
york
statute.
undoubtedly,
there
will
be
cases
arising
where
the
detention
goes
beyond
those
limits
as
there
are
cases
in
every
police
rule
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
think
the
courts
and
this
court
are
well-equipped
to
point
out
to
the
police
the
true
standards
and
the
proper
boundaries
as
the
cases
arrive.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
it
is
contemplated
--
mr.
michael
juviler
he
could
not
stop
your
honor
but
he
could
stop
someone
with
--
mr.
michael
juviler
--
reasonably
suspected
of
a
serious
crime.
now,
if
your
honor,
if
the
officer
--
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
juviler
absolutely,
the
statute
is
unequivocal
in
that
respect
and
it
has
been
so
construed
in
the
peters
case.
there's
no
way
to
read
the
statute
any
other
way.
you
can't
just
go
and
ask
someone's
name
who
is
not
under
a
reasonable
suspicion
and
frisk
him,
it's
absolutely
unauthorized.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
because
the
frisk
often
is
at
the
initial
stages
--
mr.
michael
juviler
of
the
questioning
and
--
mr.
michael
juviler
that's
right.
mr.
michael
juviler
yes,
and
there
were
some
instances
where
--
mr.
michael
juviler
the
latter,
he
must
reasonably
suspect
that
his
life
is
or
limb
is
in
danger.
mr.
michael
juviler
that
is
the
limit.
the
statute
doesn't
authorize
a
frisk
in
every
instance
and
it
hasn't
been
despite
the
claims
that
have
been
made
at
this
court.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
so.
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
it's
a
dangerous.
i
think
he
chased
him
so
that
he
could
stop
him
and
bring
him
back
to
the
scene.
i
think
he
chased
mr.
peter
so
that
he
could
stop
him
and
bring
him
back
to
the
scene
and
see
what
happen
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
expect
the
officer
to
do
that
without
making
a
very
minimal
self-protective
inquiry.
now
if
the
officer
had
been
shot
and
killed
that
would
have
been
impossible
to
balance
against
the
number
of
people
who
are
touched
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
michael
juviler
so
that's
why
he
detained
them
and
i
think
he
frisked
them
--
mr.
michael
juviler
i
think
it's
a
problem
of
reasonableness.
mr.
michael
juviler
it's
probable
cause
to
believe
in
the
context
of
an
actual
arrest
and
it's
context
of
other
searches
or
intrusions,
probable
cause
can
just
mean
reasonableness
that
was
the
express
language
of
a
majority
of
this
court
in
the
camara
case.
i
think
that
the
probable
cause
standard
which
is
stated
in
the
fourth
amendment
applicable
to
warrants
is
not
designed
to
cover
every
intrusion
of
any
kind
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
so
held.
that
is
just
one
example,
singled
out
by
the
framers
because
there
was
a
particular
evil
that
was
aimed
at
that
required
the
specification
of
that
one
example
of
reasonableness.
and
whether
the
court
should
consider
this
probable
cause
or
consider
it
a
search
or
seizure
that
is
not
unreasonable.
i
think
the
ultimate
result
is
that
what
the
officer
did
in
this
case
and
many
other
cases
that
it
represents
was
reasonable
and
if
it's
reasonable
the
conduct
should
not
be
disapproved
by
the
court
and
evidence
obtained
in
this
reasonable
manner
under
traditional
rulings
is
admissible
in
court.
