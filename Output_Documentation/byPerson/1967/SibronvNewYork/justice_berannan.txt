mr.
justice
berannan
may
i
ask
mr.
juviler,
conceptually
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
--
for
the
fourth
amendment
issue
you
would
–
is
it
your
submission
that
a
frisk
is
or
is
not
a
search?
mr.
justice
berannan
it
is
a
search.
mr.
justice
berannan
may
i
ask
–
and
then
do
you
also
conceptually
regard
the
stop
as
a
seizure
the
stop
and
--
mr.
justice
berannan
well
then
i
gather
your
argument
is
that
--
what
then
occurs
both
as
to
the
stop
and
the
frisk
is
right,
is
reasonable?
mr.
justice
berannan
the
seizure
that's
not
unreasonable
and
a
search
that's
not
reasonable.
mr.
justice
berannan
that's
conceptually
your
approach?
mr.
justice
berannan
they
asked
the
suspect
question?
mr.
justice
berannan
without
miranda
warning?
mr.
justice
berannan
[voice
overlap],
isn't
it?
mr.
justice
berannan
and
here
i
gather
you
are
saying
that
detention
is
a
custodial
detention,
isn't
it?
mr.
justice
berannan
mr.
juviler
tell
me,
in
new
york
now
that
you
have
the
stop-and-frisk
law,
is
the
authority
of
the
policeman
to
stop
the
ordinary
citizen,
ask
him
a
question
and
his
name
and
what
he
is
doing,
limited
to
circumstances
where
a
officer
has
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
the
crime
has
been
committed
and
he
maybe
involved.
is
that
the
only
circumstance
now
and
now
that
you
have
the
statute
that
the
policeman
may
stop?
mr.
justice
berannan
but
even
with
the
stop-and-frisk,
well
then
an
officer
may
stop
me
in
the
street
having
no
reasonable
suspicion
of
anything
and
ask
me
my
name
and
what
i'm
doing.
they
do
that
now
that
you
--
mr.
justice
berannan
well
i
certainly
don't
read
the
appendices
to
your
brief
as
suggesting
that
with
all
those
really
elaborate
regulations
that
at
least
new
york
city
has
set
it?
mr.
justice
berannan
are
those
what
you
have
in
your
brief?
mr.
justice
berannan
i
have
the
impression
now
that
that's
the
only
option
police
officer
has
and
he
has
to
justify
a
stop
on
the
basis
of
factual
statements
which
will
amount
to
reasonable
suspicion,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
mr.
justice
berannan
i
just
want
a
simple
situation
where
i'm
standing
in
times
square
and
he
comes
up
to
me
and
asks
me
my
name
and
what
i'm
doing.
mr.
justice
berannan
i
know
that
may
[inaudible]
anymore
to
that
--
mr.
justice
berannan
does
he
have
to
make
a
--
mr.
justice
berannan
mr.
juviler,
may
i
ask
this,
under
this
statute
is
it
contemplated
that
an
officer
who
stops
me
on
the
street
may
before
he
says
anything,
frisk
me.
mr.
justice
berannan
he
may
just
stop
me
and
before
he
asks
my
name
or
anything
else,
he
frisks
me?
mr.
justice
berannan
i
wonder
why
he
couldn't?
mr.
justice
berannan
that's
the
only
time
then
in
the
situation
where
there
isn't
--
mr.
justice
berannan
--
reasonable
suspicion
he
may
not
frisk,
is
that
--?
mr.
justice
berannan
but
if
you
do
have
reasonable
suspicion
then
without
asking
him
any
questions
you
may
immediately
frisk
him?
mr.
justice
berannan
well
certainly
if
the
justification
for
the
frisk
is
--
mr.
justice
berannan
--
that
the
officer
not
be
killed
or
injured.
mr.
justice
berannan
well
it
did
say
it
was
a
noise
at
the
door.
mr.
justice
berannan
in
this
instant
he
had
the
burglar's
tolls
to
get
in?
mr.
justice
berannan
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
berannan
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
berannan
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
berannan
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
berannan
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
berannan
but
suppose
we
[inaudible]
you
are
not
suggesting
that,
are
you?
mr.
justice
berannan
you
are
so
anxious
to
have
us
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
berannan
namely
that
it
was
probably
cause?
mr.
justice
berannan
[inaudible]
i
don't
understand
why
if
we
read
this
record
as
establishing
probable
cause
whatever
you
say
or
your
state
court
says,
we
can't
sustain
this
conviction
on
that
ground
too,
why
not?
mr.
justice
berannan
may
not
demand
it.
well,
i
am
asking
you
why
it
is
we
can't
do
that
if
that's
the
way
we
read
the
record?
mr.
justice
berannan
[inaudible]
does
this
statute
authorize
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
berannan
[inaudible]
i
am
just
wondering
that
does
this
mean
that
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
berannan
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
berannan
as
it's
being
regularly
applied
to
this
situation.
mr.
justice
berannan
mr.
duggan
would
i
only
be
putting
what
you
just
said
in
different
words
if
i
were
say
that
when
he
had
a
frisk
and
he
came
across
something
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
was
a
lethal
weapon,
but
then
at
that
moment
probable
cause
for
search
existed.
mr.
justice
berannan
win
and
get
it,
[voice
overlap]
and
then
no
matter
what
he
turns
out,
contraband
whether
a
weapon
or
not.
mr.
justice
berannan
whether
there
is
a
weapon
or
not?
mr.
justice
berannan
and
no
state
police.
mr.
justice
berannan
probably
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
berannan
but
do
you
have
any
essential
disagreements
with
the,
with
over
those
new
york
county
regulations.
