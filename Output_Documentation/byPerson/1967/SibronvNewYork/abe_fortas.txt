you
don't
have
to
be
a
policeman
to
do

do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
to
be
a
policeman
to
do
that,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
oberman
may
i
ask
you,
what
you
consider
to
be
the
basis
of
the
district
attorney's
confession
of
error,
why
does
he
confess
error,
as
you
read
the
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
you
can't
but
how
do
you
read
the,
read
the
brief,
do
you
read
it
as
a
confession
of
error
based
upon
the
proposition
that
this
was
a
search
not
permitted
either
by
the
statute
or
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
it
says,
search
or
frisk
or
do
you
read
it
as
indicating
a
confession
of
error
because
the
district
attorney
believes
there
was
not
reasonable
grounds
for
the
policeman's
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
this
wording
of
the
statute
or
in
the
new
york
cases,
this
court
as
i
understood
you
say,
which
is
that
the
person's
stop
on
the
street
by
the
policeman
has
to
remain
and
answer
his
questions?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
statute
does
not
say
that
it
will
be
unlawful
for
the
person
to
define,
to
cooperate
with
the
officer.
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
ever
been
a
prosecution
of
a
person
for
leaving
the
officer's
presence?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
about
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
been
such
a
prosecution
under
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
[inaudible]
there
never
is
a
reason
not
a
problem
for
right
now
and
--
so
your
--
i'm
trying
to
get
the
basis
for
your
construction
of
the
statute,
if
a
statute
may
legal
or
anything
in
conclusion
if
it's
construed
as
nothing
more
than
an
authorization
of
a
policeman
presumably
and
protect
him
against
civil
liability
for
stopping
and
frisking
and
making
the
demand
[inaudible]
and
we
make
them
to
one,
one
might
get
to
one
conclusion
upon
construed
the
statute
as
merely
an
authorization
to
the
policeman,
one
might
conceivably
reach
the
conclusion
if
one
read
the
statute
as
imposing
upon
the
citizen
a
duty
to
respond
to
policeman.
i'm
not
saying
that
i
would,
but
i
said
theoretically
there
are
those
two
possibilities.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if
you
have
any
basis
other
than
the
word
“demand”
for
the
item
that
you're
making
last,
it's
in
the
later
category.
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
facts
of
this
case,
there's
a
special
or
narrow
issue
under
the
statute.
the
statute
does
purport
so
many
words,
authorize
the
officer
after
he's
made
the
stop
and
the
frisk
or
search.
if
he
finds
a
weapon
or
any
other
thing
in
the
possession
of
which
may
constitute
a
crime,
he's
authorized
by
statute
to
take
it
and
keep
it.
in
this
particular
case
the
officer
found
an
envelope
containing
narcotics
and
so
he
kept
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
matter
of
facts
in
this
case
for
anything
just
that
narrow
issue
and
don't
raise
the
question
of
one
of
the
consequence
is
that
the
officer
frisk
the
person,
came
across
a
gun
and
took
the
gun
away
from
him.
do
you
see
any
difference
between
those
two?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
those
two
situations
raise
the
same
constitutional
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
thought
it
was
safety
from
--
the
policeman
from
being
killed
or
wounded
by
an
armed
man
or
woman,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
then
the
officer
being
or
killed
or
wounded
by
an
armed
man
or
a
woman
or
i
suppose
child.
well,
if
the
statute
were
then
limited
to
permitting
the
introduction
of
the
use
of
weapons
discovered
as
a
result
of
such
a
pat
down
at
least
would
i
should
think
arguably
tend
to
discourage
abuse
of
the
statute
in
order
to
find
narcotics
or
stolen
goods
or
other
things
that
might
be
in
the
pockets
of
the
citizenry
walking
in
the
streets
of
new
york.
justice
abe
fortas
when
did
it
become
moot,
after
we
granted
the
--?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
defer
with
the
district
attorney
for
brooklyn
or
whatever
it
is,
kings
county
with
respect
to
the
confession
of
error
in
the
sibron
case?
justice
abe
fortas
and
on
what
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
you
also
do
you
–
what
position
do
you
take
as
to
whether
the
actual
frisk
or
search
whichever
it
maybe
as
within
the
scope
of
statute
constitutionally
considered?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
quite
an
answer.
you
know
the
facts
in
sibron.
justice
abe
fortas
what
the
officer
did
and
my
question
to
you,
your
capacity
as
representing
new
york
county,
is
whether
you
consider
that,
the
action
of
the
officer
there
in
that
case
in
sibron
as
being
within
the
scope
of
the
stop
and,
so
called
stop
and
frisk
statute
constitutionally
considered?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words
then
there
are
two
reasons
here
for
the
confession
of
error.
one
is
a
lack
of
reasonable
or
the
basis
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
the
other
that
this
was
not
what
that
officer
actually
did,
that
is
to
say
reaching
into
the
man's
pocket,
was
not
what
permitted
by
the
stop
and
frisk
statute
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
limitations
from
the
application
of
that
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
try
your
case,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
take
a
case,
if
you
will,
in
which
the
officer
has
probable
cause
but
he
has
plenty
of
time
and
opportunity
to
obtain
a
warrant
but
without
obtaining
a
warrant
acting
solely
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause,
he
arrests
the
person.
is
that
arrest
valid
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
these
facts
do
not
constitute
probable
cause
for
an
arrest?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
some
of
us
may
feel
very
pleased
of
the
very
high
standards
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
instance,
but
when
you
look
at
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment,
you
regard
this
as
a
case
of
probable
cause?
justice
abe
fortas
you
do?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman
i
have
always
a
problem
about
reading
records
in
this
area,
but
here
the
policeman
heard
this
noise,
words
--
exact
instruments
to
describe
the
noise,
but
the
policeman
heard
a
noise
and
he
picked
up
the
telephone
and
he
called
the
local
police,
didn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
now
then
that
suggests
to
the
reasonable
mind
that
it
was
not
the
noise
of
somebody
walking
through
the
hall
and
going
to
a
cocktail
party,
because
i
suppose
a
policemen,
one
may
assume
the
policemen
are
considered
they
call
a
policeman
and
don't
put
in
alliance
for
no
reason
at
all.
then
the
policeman
who
testified
here
got
his
service
revolver
and
finally
went
charging,
after
making
this
telephone
call
and
went
charging
out
of
his
door
with
a
drawn
revolver
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
should
have
been
a
lunacy
inquiry
about
this
policeman
or
that
one
has
to
read
this
with
some
with
authority
here
and
assume
that
these
noises
were
something
more
than
just
a
noise
that
they
consider
a
citizen
tiptoeing
down
the
halls
so
it
wouldn't
disturb
people
having
a
siesta.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
take
a
case,
if
you
will,
where
the
policeman
stops
a
person
having
reasonable
basis
for
doing
it.
justice
abe
fortas
then
because
of
whatever
facts
may
exist,
he
has
reasonable
basis
for
being
afraid
that
he
will
be
--
that
fellow
is
going
to
attack
him
and
so
he
frisks
him
and
then
he
finds
a
pistol
and
i'm
sure
you'll
take
the
position
that
pistol
maybe
used
in
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
finds
an
envelope
with
narcotics,
the
glassine
envelope
narcotics,
you
take
a
position
that
that
maybe
used
in
evidence
even
though
the
circumstances
do
not
amount
of
probable
cause,
but
barely
amounted
to
reasonable
suspicion
whatever
the
difference
maybe.
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
maybe
you
said
this
is
a
search
maybe
you
said
it's
not
a
search
but
do
you
think
that
this
statute
authorizes
a
search
of
the
person
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
police
officer
is
in
danger.
justice
abe
fortas
a
general
search
of
the
person?
justice
abe
fortas
we're
on
the
section;
it
doesn't
say
that
i
think
we'd
agree
with
that
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
take
my
case,
glassine
envelope
with
narcotics
in
it,
pretty
hard
to
think
if
that's
a
pistol
or
knife?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
it
was
found
on
the
inside
pocket
where
some
people
carry
guns,
as
i
understand,
inside
pocket
of
his
jacket?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
find
of
the
frisk?
justice
abe
fortas
that
--
you're
shifting.
justice
abe
fortas
shifting,
you're
shifting
the
assumptions
on
it.
let
me
do
it
again.
i'd
suppose
that
he's
got
reasonable
basis
for
stopping
him
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
has
a
reasonable
basis
for
fearing
that
he
may
be
in
danger
that
he
the
police
officer
may
be
in
danger.
then
you'd
say
that
you
might
have
to
man
down
first
thing
and
he
does
that.
not
content
with
that
he
reaches
him
into
the
man's
inside
pocket
and
you
know
he
hadn't
felt
anything,
it
feels
like
a
gun
or
a
knife
and
he
pulls
out
a
glassine
envelope
containing
narcotics.
has
he
or
has
he
not
violated
the
--
is
there
or
is
there
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
sense
that
in
the
mapp
against
ohio
this,
the
narcotics
that
he
found
cannot
be
used
in
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
the
whole
case
here
is
--
your
case
here
must
necessarily
unless
we
assume
that
there
is
probably
cause,
the
case
here
must
assume
that
a
police
officer
when
he
came
across
the
so
fake
envelope
containing
the
burglary
tools
--
justice
abe
fortas
rightly
thought
he
had
felt
a
knife
or
some
lethal
weapon,
we
have
to
assume
that,
don't
we?
justice
abe
fortas
well
his
testimony
is
ambiguous
about
it,
well
he
said
at
least
as
i
remember,
as
to
whether,
whether
he
thought
it
was
a
knife
or
did
not
think
it
was
a
knife,
but
anyway
you
have
to
make
the
assumption
that
the
police
officer
went
after
what
he
thought
or
might
reasonably
have
thought
was
a
lethal
weapon,
alright?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
you
take
that,
then
you
go
from
there
and
say
that
even
though
what
he
pulled
out
was
not
a
knife,
but
a
sort
of
burglary
tool
or
let
us
say
a
pouch
containing
narcotics
that
that
maybe
used
in
evidence
against
him?
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
not
to
limit
to
right
to
search
to
the
statutory
premises
and
you
may
not
limit
the
fruits
of
the
search
and
what
maybe
done
with
the
fruits
of
the
search.
so
let's
go
for
the
second
paragraph
of
this
statute
namely
something
necessary
--
something
of
which
the
policeman
might
have
or
been
put
in
fear.
justice
abe
fortas
well
why
do
you
exclude
the
cuffs
of
his
pants?
justice
abe
fortas
[voice
overlap]
compromise
to
it
and
then
maybe
all
light
things
but
one
has
man
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
well
mr.
siegel
you
say
the
constitutional
standard
may
relax
upon
standards
and
--
where
the
purpose
of
the
search
is
not
to
secure
evidence
for
the
commission
of
the
crime,
but
let's
assume
the
moment
that
is
so,
what
do
you
say
to
such
--
what
do
you
say
in
answer
to
the
question
that
i
asked
of
mr.
duggan,
that
is
to
say
if
the
search
is
justified
by
a
purpose
other
than
the
search
for
evidence,
that
the
search
is
justified
because
it
is
merely
directed
to
protection
of
the
policeman
should
anything
that
he
finds
which
is
not
related
to
that
be
excluded
from
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
think
we
all
understand
that,
but
you
are
asking
us
to
use
a
standard
here
to
do
what
you
call
relaxing
a
constitutional
probation.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
asking
us
to
use
a
standard
of
purpose,
what
was
policeman's
purpose.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
sorry
about?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
when
you
are
talking
about
the
purpose
i
suppose
you
are
talking
about
a
--
what
the
policeman
had
in
mind
may
have
--
may
refer
to
objective
circumstances
to
find
out
what
his
purpose
was?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
to
be
a
policeman
to
do
that,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
to
be
a
policeman
to
do
that,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
oberman
may
i
ask
you,
what
you
consider
to
be
the
basis
of
the
district
attorney's
confession
of
error,
why
does
he
confess
error,
as
you
read
the
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
you
can't
but
how
do
you
read
the,
read
the
brief,
do
you
read
it
as
a
confession
of
error
based
upon
the
proposition
that
this
was
a
search
not
permitted
either
by
the
statute
or
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
it
says,
search
or
frisk
or
do
you
read
it
as
indicating
a
confession
of
error
because
the
district
attorney
believes
there
was
not
reasonable
grounds
for
the
policeman's
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
this
wording
of
the
statute
or
in
the
new
york
cases,
this
court
as
i
understood
you
say,
which
is
that
the
person's
stop
on
the
street
by
the
policeman
has
to
remain
and
answer
his
questions?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
statute
does
not
say
that
it
will
be
unlawful
for
the
person
to
define,
to
cooperate
with
the
officer.
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
ever
been
a
prosecution
of
a
person
for
leaving
the
officer's
presence?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
about
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
been
such
a
prosecution
under
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
[inaudible]
there
never
is
a
reason
not
a
problem
for
right
now
and
--
so
your
--
i'm
trying
to
get
the
basis
for
your
construction
of
the
statute,
if
a
statute
may
legal
or
anything
in
conclusion
if
it's
construed
as
nothing
more
than
an
authorization
of
a
policeman
presumably
and
protect
him
against
civil
liability
for
stopping
and
frisking
and
making
the
demand
[inaudible]
and
we
make
them
to
one,
one
might
get
to
one
conclusion
upon
construed
the
statute
as
merely
an
authorization
to
the
policeman,
one
might
conceivably
reach
the
conclusion
if
one
read
the
statute
as
imposing
upon
the
citizen
a
duty
to
respond
to
policeman.
i'm
not
saying
that
i
would,
but
i
said
theoretically
there
are
those
two
possibilities.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if
you
have
any
basis
other
than
the
word
“demand”
for
the
item
that
you're
making
last,
it's
in
the
later
category.
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
facts
of
this
case,
there's
a
special
or
narrow
issue
under
the
statute.
the
statute
does
purport
so
many
words,
authorize
the
officer
after
he's
made
the
stop
and
the
frisk
or
search.
if
he
finds
a
weapon
or
any
other
thing
in
the
possession
of
which
may
constitute
a
crime,
he's
authorized
by
statute
to
take
it
and
keep
it.
in
this
particular
case
the
officer
found
an
envelope
containing
narcotics
and
so
he
kept
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
matter
of
facts
in
this
case
for
anything
just
that
narrow
issue
and
don't
raise
the
question
of
one
of
the
consequence
is
that
the
officer
frisk
the
person,
came
across
a
gun
and
took
the
gun
away
from
him.
do
you
see
any
difference
between
those
two?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
those
two
situations
raise
the
same
constitutional
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
thought
it
was
safety
from
--
the
policeman
from
being
killed
or
wounded
by
an
armed
man
or
woman,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
then
the
officer
being
or
killed
or
wounded
by
an
armed
man
or
a
woman
or
i
suppose
child.
well,
if
the
statute
were
then
limited
to
permitting
the
introduction
of
the
use
of
weapons
discovered
as
a
result
of
such
a
pat
down
at
least
would
i
should
think
arguably
tend
to
discourage
abuse
of
the
statute
in
order
to
find
narcotics
or
stolen
goods
or
other
things
that
might
be
in
the
pockets
of
the
citizenry
walking
in
the
streets
of
new
york.
justice
abe
fortas
when
did
it
become
moot,
after
we
granted
the
--?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
defer
with
the
district
attorney
for
brooklyn
or
whatever
it
is,
kings
county
with
respect
to
the
confession
of
error
in
the
sibron
case?
justice
abe
fortas
and
on
what
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
you
also
do
you
–
what
position
do
you
take
as
to
whether
the
actual
frisk
or
search
whichever
it
maybe
as
within
the
scope
of
statute
constitutionally
considered?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
quite
an
answer.
you
know
the
facts
in
sibron.
justice
abe
fortas
what
the
officer
did
and
my
question
to
you,
your
capacity
as
representing
new
york
county,
is
whether
you
consider
that,
the
action
of
the
officer
there
in
that
case
in
sibron
as
being
within
the
scope
of
the
stop
and,
so
called
stop
and
frisk
statute
constitutionally
considered?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words
then
there
are
two
reasons
here
for
the
confession
of
error.
one
is
a
lack
of
reasonable
or
the
basis
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
the
other
that
this
was
not
what
that
officer
actually
did,
that
is
to
say
reaching
into
the
man's
pocket,
was
not
what
permitted
by
the
stop
and
frisk
statute
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
limitations
from
the
application
of
that
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
try
your
case,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
take
a
case,
if
you
will,
in
which
the
officer
has
probable
cause
but
he
has
plenty
of
time
and
opportunity
to
obtain
a
warrant
but
without
obtaining
a
warrant
acting
solely
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause,
he
arrests
the
person.
is
that
arrest
valid
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
these
facts
do
not
constitute
probable
cause
for
an
arrest?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
some
of
us
may
feel
very
pleased
of
the
very
high
standards
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
instance,
but
when
you
look
at
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment,
you
regard
this
as
a
case
of
probable
cause?
justice
abe
fortas
you
do?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman
i
have
always
a
problem
about
reading
records
in
this
area,
but
here
the
policeman
heard
this
noise,
words
--
exact
instruments
to
describe
the
noise,
but
the
policeman
heard
a
noise
and
he
picked
up
the
telephone
and
he
called
the
local
police,
didn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
now
then
that
suggests
to
the
reasonable
mind
that
it
was
not
the
noise
of
somebody
walking
through
the
hall
and
going
to
a
cocktail
party,
because
i
suppose
a
policemen,
one
may
assume
the
policemen
are
considered
they
call
a
policeman
and
don't
put
in
alliance
for
no
reason
at
all.
then
the
policeman
who
testified
here
got
his
service
revolver
and
finally
went
charging,
after
making
this
telephone
call
and
went
charging
out
of
his
door
with
a
drawn
revolver
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
should
have
been
a
lunacy
inquiry
about
this
policeman
or
that
one
has
to
read
this
with
some
with
authority
here
and
assume
that
these
noises
were
something
more
than
just
a
noise
that
they
consider
a
citizen
tiptoeing
down
the
halls
so
it
wouldn't
disturb
people
having
a
siesta.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
take
a
case,
if
you
will,
where
the
policeman
stops
a
person
having
reasonable
basis
for
doing
it.
justice
abe
fortas
then
because
of
whatever
facts
may
exist,
he
has
reasonable
basis
for
being
afraid
that
he
will
be
--
that
fellow
is
going
to
attack
him
and
so
he
frisks
him
and
then
he
finds
a
pistol
and
i'm
sure
you'll
take
the
position
that
pistol
maybe
used
in
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
finds
an
envelope
with
narcotics,
the
glassine
envelope
narcotics,
you
take
a
position
that
that
maybe
used
in
evidence
even
though
the
circumstances
do
not
amount
of
probable
cause,
but
barely
amounted
to
reasonable
suspicion
whatever
the
difference
maybe.
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
maybe
you
said
this
is
a
search
maybe
you
said
it's
not
a
search
but
do
you
think
that
this
statute
authorizes
a
search
of
the
person
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
police
officer
is
in
danger.
justice
abe
fortas
a
general
search
of
the
person?
justice
abe
fortas
we're
on
the
section;
it
doesn't
say
that
i
think
we'd
agree
with
that
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
take
my
case,
glassine
envelope
with
narcotics
in
it,
pretty
hard
to
think
if
that's
a
pistol
or
knife?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
it
was
found
on
the
inside
pocket
where
some
people
carry
guns,
as
i
understand,
inside
pocket
of
his
jacket?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
find
of
the
frisk?
justice
abe
fortas
that
--
you're
shifting.
justice
abe
fortas
shifting,
you're
shifting
the
assumptions
on
it.
let
me
do
it
again.
i'd
suppose
that
he's
got
reasonable
basis
for
stopping
him
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
has
a
reasonable
basis
for
fearing
that
he
may
be
in
danger
that
he
the
police
officer
may
be
in
danger.
then
you'd
say
that
you
might
have
to
man
down
first
thing
and
he
does
that.
not
content
with
that
he
reaches
him
into
the
man's
inside
pocket
and
you
know
he
hadn't
felt
anything,
it
feels
like
a
gun
or
a
knife
and
he
pulls
out
a
glassine
envelope
containing
narcotics.
has
he
or
has
he
not
violated
the
--
is
there
or
is
there
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
sense
that
in
the
mapp
against
ohio
this,
the
narcotics
that
he
found
cannot
be
used
in
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
the
whole
case
here
is
--
your
case
here
must
necessarily
unless
we
assume
that
there
is
probably
cause,
the
case
here
must
assume
that
a
police
officer
when
he
came
across
the
so
fake
envelope
containing
the
burglary
tools
--
justice
abe
fortas
rightly
thought
he
had
felt
a
knife
or
some
lethal
weapon,
we
have
to
assume
that,
don't
we?
justice
abe
fortas
well
his
testimony
is
ambiguous
about
it,
well
he
said
at
least
as
i
remember,
as
to
whether,
whether
he
thought
it
was
a
knife
or
did
not
think
it
was
a
knife,
but
anyway
you
have
to
make
the
assumption
that
the
police
officer
went
after
what
he
thought
or
might
reasonably
have
thought
was
a
lethal
weapon,
alright?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
you
take
that,
then
you
go
from
there
and
say
that
even
though
what
he
pulled
out
was
not
a
knife,
but
a
sort
of
burglary
tool
or
let
us
say
a
pouch
containing
narcotics
that
that
maybe
used
in
evidence
against
him?
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
not
to
limit
to
right
to
search
to
the
statutory
premises
and
you
may
not
limit
the
fruits
of
the
search
and
what
maybe
done
with
the
fruits
of
the
search.
so
let's
go
for
the
second
paragraph
of
this
statute
namely
something
necessary
--
something
of
which
the
policeman
might
have
or
been
put
in
fear.
justice
abe
fortas
well
why
do
you
exclude
the
cuffs
of
his
pants?
justice
abe
fortas
[voice
overlap]
compromise
to
it
and
then
maybe
all
light
things
but
one
has
man
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
well
mr.
siegel
you
say
the
constitutional
standard
may
relax
upon
standards
and
--
where
the
purpose
of
the
search
is
not
to
secure
evidence
for
the
commission
of
the
crime,
but
let's
assume
the
moment
that
is
so,
what
do
you
say
to
such
--
what
do
you
say
in
answer
to
the
question
that
i
asked
of
mr.
duggan,
that
is
to
say
if
the
search
is
justified
by
a
purpose
other
than
the
search
for
evidence,
that
the
search
is
justified
because
it
is
merely
directed
to
protection
of
the
policeman
should
anything
that
he
finds
which
is
not
related
to
that
be
excluded
from
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
think
we
all
understand
that,
but
you
are
asking
us
to
use
a
standard
here
to
do
what
you
call
relaxing
a
constitutional
probation.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
asking
us
to
use
a
standard
of
purpose,
what
was
policeman's
purpose.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
sorry
about?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
when
you
are
talking
about
the
purpose
i
suppose
you
are
talking
about
a
--
what
the
policeman
had
in
mind
may
have
--
may
refer
to
objective
circumstances
to
find
out
what
his
purpose
was?
