well
that's
what
they
use

justice

may
i
ask
you
this
when

what
is
the
difference
between
reasonable

justice

that
words

now
does
the

justice

suppose
one

had
interpreted

see
no
difference
constitutionally
speaking
between
the

justice

but
we
have
to
construe
it
according
to

since
this
is
a
comparison
of
whether
reasonable
suspicion
means
probably
cause,
so
the

did
say
that.
the
did
court
did
find
imaginary
distinction.
justice

on
the

justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
we
have
to
construe
what
probable

means?
justice
hugo

black
or
if
we
said
that
probable
cause
as
a
matter
of
reasonable
suspicion,
what's
the
meaning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
look
and
see
whether
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
this
man
tiptoeing
in
a
hall
of
an
apartment,
running
when
the
door
opened,
whether
that
gives
the
probable
cause
to
believe
he
is
up
to
something
bad
at
that
time
has
just
done
it
or
is
about
to
do,
that's
our
problem,
looking
at
the
circumstances
and
not
the
words
used
by
the
court
of

justice

do
you
think
the

has

that?
justice

well
you
would
say
the

has
the

ask
you,

he
doesn't

i

i

but
does
he
have
a

expect

get

justice

suppose
the

was
walking

now
they

nothing

within
three

[inaudible]
and
at

dark

rain,
they
find
a

prowling
around
in
alley
right
behind

would
you
say
that
that
gives
the
probable

for
a

to
ask
him
a
question?
justice

not
what?
justice

or
would
you

if
then
--
justice

i

then
what
can
the

do,
does
he
let
him
leave
that
this
dark
alley
at
4:00
o'clock
in
the
morning?
justice

black
nobody
had
a

to
stop
him
at
4

in
the

three
miles
from
any
business,
prowling
around
in
the
back
of
a

justice

you
would
say
that
under
those

if
the

on

go
here
and
go
away
after
he
is

justice

it
won't
be

would
it
if
he
had
committed

it
would
be
a
probable

wouldn't
it
that
he
is
there
for
a

you
can
have
a
reasonable

does
your

4

prowling

there,
can
you
conjure
up

black
i
don't
suppose
he
needed
his
burglar
tools
for
the
purpose?[laughter]
justice

of

the

whether

a

you
