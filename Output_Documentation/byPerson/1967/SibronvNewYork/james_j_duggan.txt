mr.
james
j.
duggan
mr.
chief
justice
may
the
please
court.
what
i
am
afraid
has
happened
here
is
that
perhaps
because
of
a
label
that's
been
hung
on
this
law,
it's
called
the
stop
and
frisk
and
i
think
perhaps
because
of
that
label
that
it
has
been
thought
that
these
two
rights,
the
right
to
stop
an
individual
and
the
right
to
frisk
him
arrive
simultaneously
and
exist
coextensively
and
i
don't
think
that's
so
and
i
don't
think
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
law
should
be
that
that's
so.
now
crime
is
rampant
in
the
streets.
that
it's
certainly
not
something
that
i
think
there
can
be
any
significant
argument
about.
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
cites
statistics
that
indicate
that
some
classes
of
crimes
have
risen
as
a
much
as
18%
in
the
course
of
the
past
year.
the
president's
commission
on
crime
has
indicated
that
the
fbi
figures
only
scratch
the
surface.
there
isn't,
i
don't
think
anyway,
any
argument
that
where
a
police
officer
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
or
probably
cause
to
believe
that
an
individual
has
committed
a
crime.
no
one
will
argue
i
think
that
he
has
the
right
to
arrest
that
man.
however,
if
he
has
less
than
those
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
individual
has
committed
a
crime,
he
may
not
arrest
him
and
so
in
response
to
this
middle
ground,
this
completely
uncontrolled,
at
least
statutorily
uncontrolled
ground
between
the
individual
against
whom
no
suspicion
may
arise
and
the
individual
whom
a
police
officer
may
reasonably
have
grounds
to
believe
that
he
has
committed
a
crime,
the
new
york
legislature
responded
by
passing
the
stop
and
frisk
law.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
not
basically
no
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
not
basically
again
sir
because
i
think
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
think
we
could
rely
on
rivera
because
the
federal
constitutional
law
only
considered
this
to
the
extent
that
it
controls
of
whether
--
it
decides
whether
it's
reasonable
or
unreasonable
because
the
federal
constitutional
law
prohibits
only
unreasonable
searches.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
in
that
even
your
honor
i
suggest
that
the
only
thing
that
the
court
has
to
decide
here
is
whether
this
kind
of
a
search
is
unreasonable.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don't
say
nor
do
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
do
not
say
nor
do
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
this
was
an
arrest
on
probable
cause.
i
think
we
would
be
in
very
great
difficulty
if
we
attempted
to
justify
it
on
the
theory
that
this
was
an
arrest
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
am
not
suggesting
you
can't
your
honor,
but
i
suggest
that
it
might
be
a
little
difficult
in
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
i
am
sure
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
new
york
made
two
holdings
in
this
case.
they
said
first
of
all
that
this
was
in
conformity
with
the
situation
and
with
the
case
that
was
decided
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
new
york
statute.
if
the
court
does
not
choose
to
interpret
this
statute
or
pass
upon
its
constitutionality,
it
may
still
affirm
this
conviction
on
the
same
basis
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
rivera
which
predated
the
statute.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no,
not
probably
cause
your
honor,
but
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
search
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
existed.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don't
demand
that
the
court
do
anything.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don't
say
you
can't
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
believe
basically
stated
it
is
your
honor
because
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
the
standard
of
the
federal
constitution,
the
standard
of
reasonableness.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
probable
cause
for
what
your
honor?
i've
heard
the
name
probable
--
the
word
probable
cause,
if
you
mean
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
man
has
committed
a
crime,
no,
at
least
i
view
this
case
as
not
coming
up
to
those
standards.
if
the
court
means
probable
cause
to
suspect,
that
there
is
purpose
to
stop
this
man
and
asking
him
his
business,
then
i
think
yes,
the
answer
can
be
yes.
i
don't
think
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
this
individual
committed
it.
i
am
only
saying
and
what
i
am
pointing
towards
your
honor,
is
that
this
statute
does
not
at
heart
authorize
a
search
or
a
frisk.
this
authorizes
a
police
officer
to
stop
a
suspicious
individual.
now
in
paraphrasing
the
statute,
the
statute
says
whom
he
reasonably
suspects.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor
the
reason
the
appellate
--.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
he
is
a
police
office,
your
honor.
our
court
of
appeals
has
seen
fit
to
permit
a
police
officer
from
one
jurisdiction
and
they
did
this
by
this
case
your
honor,
they
have
seen
fit
to
permit
a
police
officer
from
one
jurisdiction
to
cross
over
into
another
jurisdiction
and
still
remain
a
police
officer.
i
can't
see
that
as
a
problem
that
this
court
need
resolve
because
it
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor
a
police
officer
is
a
police
officer
under
the
laws
of
state
of
new
york
24
hours
a
day.
he
can
be
playing
bridge
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
there
are
many
jurisdiction
in
the
state
of
new
york,
new
york
city
being
among
which
require
a
policemen
to
go
forth
armed
24
hours
a
day,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
he
is
on
duty
in
the
sense
that
he
is
required
to
respond.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
this
may
sound
silly,
your
honor,
but
i
think
he
must
be
so
regarded.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
because
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor
i'll
take
the
same
position
that
the
appellants
took
yesterday
in
sibron.
i
don't
care
on
what
basis
the
court
chooses
to
affirm
this
conviction.
i'll
be
quite
honest,
if
the
court
does
not
see
that
it
is
necessary
to
come
to
this
point
i
don't
press
it
upon
the
court.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
a
great
deal
will
depend
on
i
should
think
anyway
the
interpretation
that
you
would
give
to
the
expression
public
place,
i
think
it
might.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir
i
think
so.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don't
this
being
applied
your
honor,
because
when
you
say
regular
it
imports
a
certain
prescribed
or
preordained
course
of
conduct
and
it's
not
--
i
don't
think
to
be
anticipated
that
in
a
preordained
way
or
a
preregulated
way
that
suspicious
circumstances
are
going
to
occur,
which
will
make
this
a
necessary
or
a
routine
thing
or
a
4
o'clock
every
afternoon
affair.
a
stolen
car
for
example
i
should
assume
yes
that
it
would
be
done
on
a
routine
preordained
basis
because
a
policeman
is
to
be
expected
to
be
able
to
see
a
stolen
car.
i
have
heard
a
great
many
people
say
here
that
is
the
subjective
determination
of
the
officer
and
i
would
like
to
answer
that
point
because
i
just
cannot
believe
that
this
court
is
prepared
to
decide
that
what
a
police
officer
decides
on
the
streets
is
the
very
last
word
in
the
point,
because
the
fact
that
we
stand
here
this
morning
debating
the
reasonableness
of
what
samuel
l.
lasky
did
in
the
hallway
of
a
public
building
in
mount
vernon
in
july
of
1964
certainly
gives
the
lie
to
any
suggestion
that
the
policeman
is
the
final
arbiter
of
the
thing.
by
reason
of
this
court's
determination
in
mapp
against
ohio
and
miranda
against
arizona,
new
york
has
now
developed,
something
they
never
had
before,
a
workable,
practical
daily
routine
whereby
the
admissibility
of
evidence
prior
to
a
trial
is
decided
upon
and
passed
upon
as
a
legal
question.
there's
nothing
so
amorphous
as
reasonable
grounds
for
anything.
so
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
a
policeman's
capacity
to
decide
what
is
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed,
i
see
no
reason
for
withdrawing
from
him,
the
acumen
to
decide
when
there's
reasonable
ground
to
suspect
because
on
the
following
morning,
a
court
will
convene
some
place
in
that
jurisdiction
who
will
pass
on
whether
or
not
this
officer
had
these
reasonable
grounds
to
suspect.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
he
made
that
equation
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
don't
think
that
he
intended
by
that
to
indicate
that
this
police
officer
was
not
going
to
be
called
into
account.
now
it
may
very
well
be
that
he
did
say
that
reasonable
suspicion,
which
has
to
be
acted
upon
immediately
will
arise
more
quickly
or
more
perceptibly
in
the
eyes
of
an
experienced
police
officer.
i
don't
think
he
said
that
we're
going
to
accept
this
police
officer's
determination
blind.
i
don't
think
he
intended,
i'm
sure
he
didn't
intend.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor
i
hesitate
very
long
to
tell
this
court
that
it's
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
something.
but
if
the
court
decides
that
the
way
to
curtail
unwarranted
frisks
and
searches
by
police
officers
where
there's
no
evidence
found
is
to
tell
them
that
they
will
suppress
the
evidence
which
is
not
found,
i
think
perhaps
the
court
maybe
disappointed.
because
for
example,
if
it
is
to
be
decided
by
some
municipal
police
agency
that
the
very
fact
that
a
police
officer
will
go
out
and
just
if
i
may
be
excused
for
using
a
police
expression
roused
everybody
insight,
on
the
theory
that
if
these
people
know
they
are
subject
to
being
searched,
they
won't
carry
guns,
they
won't
carry
a
contraband
equipment.
if
this
is
going
at
some
point,
at
some
place
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
be
an
official
policy
that
is
going
to
continue
to
be
an
official
police
policy
because
they
won't
be
doing
it
for
prosecutor
purposes,
they
will
be
doing
it
for
purposes
of
control
and
it
won't
get
to
us.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no
your
honor
we
won't.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
--
saying
that
this
statute
does
not
authorize
a
search
and
i'd
like
to
return
to
that
point
for
a
minute
because
there's
there
the
seed
of
why
perhaps
in
this
particular
case
an
exclusionary
role
is
perhaps
not
going
to
be
as
effective
as
it
was
in
mapp
against
ohio.
this
statute
basically
and
truly
only
authorizes
a
stop.
this
was
designed
to
give
a
police
officer
a
weapon
to
use
in
that
very
large
area
between
total
innocence
and
likely
guilt
and
all
was
stopped
or
i'm
sorry,
all
the,
all
of
the
frisk
or
search
depending
on
which
word
you
prefer,
purports
to
do
is
to
give
the
police
officer
a
way
of
disarming
the
person
whom
he
has
stopped.
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
can
look
into
his
shoes,
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
can
conduct
a
search
of
the
interior
of
his
clothing,
it
does
not
mean
and
most
especially
is
this
case
is
illustrative
of
that
it,
it
does
not
mean
that
this
police
officer
may
look
for
evidence.
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
mr.
justice
marshall
has
pointed
out,
this
wasn't
his
city,
it
wasn't
his
responsibility,
he
had
to
go
far
out
of
this
way
to
do
what
he
did
in
this
case.
so
it's
fairly
apparent
that
he
was
not
looking
for
evidence.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir,
we
would.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir,
we
would
take
the
position
if
that
was
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
for
the
reason
your
honor
that
as
a
basic
proposition,
as
a
search
may
not
be
justified
by
what
it
turns
up
it
may
not
be
condemned
by
what
it
turns
up.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no
sir,
i
do
not
say
that.
if,
for
example,
a
police
officer
approaches
someone
and
he
frisks
him
that's
all
that
this
section
purports
to
authorize
him
to
do.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
well,
let's
call
it
a
search
then.
i
mean,
i
don't
want
to
dodge
an
issue
for
a
word.
let's
say
that
we
assume
that
this
officer
has
the
right
to
search
an
external
--
exterior
search
of
this
individual
and
he
finds
as
the
officer
did
in
this
case
what
he
has
reason
to
believe
is
a
weapon.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
grant
you
that
your
honor
and
i
was
assuming
perhaps
erroneously
and
if
i
have
made
gratuitous
assumption
i
withdraw
it.
i
was
assuming
your
honor
that
the
glassine
envelope
of
narcotics
was
found
under
such
circumstances
as
would
have
permitted
the
officer
to
go
after
what
he
thought
was
a
gun.
i
do
not
think
so
that
if
that
for
example,
a
glassine
packet
of
narcotics
was
found
in
the
cuff
of
this
man's
pants,
i
think
it's
extremely
unlikely
that
he
would
be
looking
for
a
weapon
in
the
cuff
of
this
man's
pants.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
think
if
the
court
will
permit
me
to
make
the
assumption
that
the
officer
has
the
right
to
reach
into
that
pocket
to
recover
what
he
reasonably
believes
is
a
gun.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no,
your
honor,
but
then
he
has
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
a
crime
is
being
committed
in
his
presence.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i'm
not
shifting
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
think
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
don't
think
under
those
circumstances
he
could
use
the
narcotics.
however
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor,
it's
in
the
record,
he
felt
a
hard,
a
hard
object
which
could
have
been
a
knife.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
do
say
that,
yes
sir
because
if
the
search
was
reasonable
at
its
incidence,
when
it
began
if
was
reasonable
then
what
it
turns
up
equally
should
be
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
right
of
search
that
attached
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no
sir,
because
i
think
it's
an
artificial
comprise.
either
the
man
has
the
right
to
search
or
he
has
not
got
the
right
to
search.
if
he
has
not
got
the
right
to
search
then
nothing
that
comes
out
of
that
pocket
can
be
introduced.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
because
your
honor
i
am
assuming
perhaps
again
without
any
authority
for
doing
so
that
there
is
no
weapon
that's
going
to
be
found
in
cuffs
of
the
pants.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir
but
the
comprise
that
this
court
may
make
in
this
area
is
going
to
last
longer
than
my
comprise.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
it
could
be
so
interpreted
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
so
because
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
in
this
case.
i
think
the
statute
gives
this
man
the
right
to
protect
himself,
that's
all
it's
intended
to
do.
now
if
you
give
an
officer
authority
to
search
for
and
examine
for
the
presence
of
a
weapon
it
makes
no
sense
if
you
don't
give
him
a
corresponding
authority
to
remove
that.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
if
you
acknowledge
his
right
to
go
after
the
weapon
and
if
in
the
same
pocket
he
finds
other
contraband
yes,
i
think
it's
admissible.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
your
honor.
i
would
think
that
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
it
is.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
that's
what
the
statute
says
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor
i
have
to
go
further
perhaps
in
this
case
would
insist
that
i
do.
but
if
when
he
removes
the
gun
he
may
then
place
this
person
under
arrest
and
conduct
a
general
search
pursuant
to
the
authority
conferred
upon
him
by
that
arrest.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir
he
is,
but
he
is
also,
standing
in
the
presence
of
commission
of
a
crime.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
essentially
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
that's
what
he
is
out
there
for
your
honor,
to
detect
crime
and
to
prevent
crime
where
that's
possible.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir,
pursuant
to
the
arrest,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
not
the
formalities
which
new
york
has
imposed
your
honor
no
sir,
because
we
deal
with
43
different
police
departments
on
our
country.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
none
that
i'm
aware
of
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
seems
extremely
unlikely.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir,
i
have
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no
sir
i
don't.
mr.
chief
justice
i
more
or
less
committed
myself
to
get
mr.
siegel
a
few
minutes,
i'll
differ
to
him
if
there
is
time
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
mr.
chief
justice
may
the
please
court.
what
i
am
afraid
has
happened
here
is
that
perhaps
because
of
a
label
that's
been
hung
on
this
law,
it's
called
the
stop
and
frisk
and
i
think
perhaps
because
of
that
label
that
it
has
been
thought
that
these
two
rights,
the
right
to
stop
an
individual
and
the
right
to
frisk
him
arrive
simultaneously
and
exist
coextensively
and
i
don't
think
that's
so
and
i
don't
think
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
law
should
be
that
that's
so.
now
crime
is
rampant
in
the
streets.
that
it's
certainly
not
something
that
i
think
there
can
be
any
significant
argument
about.
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
cites
statistics
that
indicate
that
some
classes
of
crimes
have
risen
as
a
much
as
18%
in
the
course
of
the
past
year.
the
president's
commission
on
crime
has
indicated
that
the
fbi
figures
only
scratch
the
surface.
there
isn't,
i
don't
think
anyway,
any
argument
that
where
a
police
officer
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
or
probably
cause
to
believe
that
an
individual
has
committed
a
crime.
no
one
will
argue
i
think
that
he
has
the
right
to
arrest
that
man.
however,
if
he
has
less
than
those
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
individual
has
committed
a
crime,
he
may
not
arrest
him
and
so
in
response
to
this
middle
ground,
this
completely
uncontrolled,
at
least
statutorily
uncontrolled
ground
between
the
individual
against
whom
no
suspicion
may
arise
and
the
individual
whom
a
police
officer
may
reasonably
have
grounds
to
believe
that
he
has
committed
a
crime,
the
new
york
legislature
responded
by
passing
the
stop
and
frisk
law.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
not
basically
no
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
not
basically
again
sir
because
i
think
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
think
we
could
rely
on
rivera
because
the
federal
constitutional
law
only
considered
this
to
the
extent
that
it
controls
of
whether
--
it
decides
whether
it's
reasonable
or
unreasonable
because
the
federal
constitutional
law
prohibits
only
unreasonable
searches.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
in
that
even
your
honor
i
suggest
that
the
only
thing
that
the
court
has
to
decide
here
is
whether
this
kind
of
a
search
is
unreasonable.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don't
say
nor
do
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
do
not
say
nor
do
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
this
was
an
arrest
on
probable
cause.
i
think
we
would
be
in
very
great
difficulty
if
we
attempted
to
justify
it
on
the
theory
that
this
was
an
arrest
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
am
not
suggesting
you
can't
your
honor,
but
i
suggest
that
it
might
be
a
little
difficult
in
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
i
am
sure
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
new
york
made
two
holdings
in
this
case.
they
said
first
of
all
that
this
was
in
conformity
with
the
situation
and
with
the
case
that
was
decided
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
new
york
statute.
if
the
court
does
not
choose
to
interpret
this
statute
or
pass
upon
its
constitutionality,
it
may
still
affirm
this
conviction
on
the
same
basis
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
rivera
which
predated
the
statute.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no,
not
probably
cause
your
honor,
but
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
search
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
existed.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don't
demand
that
the
court
do
anything.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don't
say
you
can't
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
believe
basically
stated
it
is
your
honor
because
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
the
standard
of
the
federal
constitution,
the
standard
of
reasonableness.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
probable
cause
for
what
your
honor?
i've
heard
the
name
probable
--
the
word
probable
cause,
if
you
mean
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
man
has
committed
a
crime,
no,
at
least
i
view
this
case
as
not
coming
up
to
those
standards.
if
the
court
means
probable
cause
to
suspect,
that
there
is
purpose
to
stop
this
man
and
asking
him
his
business,
then
i
think
yes,
the
answer
can
be
yes.
i
don't
think
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
this
individual
committed
it.
i
am
only
saying
and
what
i
am
pointing
towards
your
honor,
is
that
this
statute
does
not
at
heart
authorize
a
search
or
a
frisk.
this
authorizes
a
police
officer
to
stop
a
suspicious
individual.
now
in
paraphrasing
the
statute,
the
statute
says
whom
he
reasonably
suspects.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor
the
reason
the
appellate
--.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
he
is
a
police
office,
your
honor.
our
court
of
appeals
has
seen
fit
to
permit
a
police
officer
from
one
jurisdiction
and
they
did
this
by
this
case
your
honor,
they
have
seen
fit
to
permit
a
police
officer
from
one
jurisdiction
to
cross
over
into
another
jurisdiction
and
still
remain
a
police
officer.
i
can't
see
that
as
a
problem
that
this
court
need
resolve
because
it
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor
a
police
officer
is
a
police
officer
under
the
laws
of
state
of
new
york
24
hours
a
day.
he
can
be
playing
bridge
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
there
are
many
jurisdiction
in
the
state
of
new
york,
new
york
city
being
among
which
require
a
policemen
to
go
forth
armed
24
hours
a
day,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
he
is
on
duty
in
the
sense
that
he
is
required
to
respond.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
this
may
sound
silly,
your
honor,
but
i
think
he
must
be
so
regarded.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
because
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor
i'll
take
the
same
position
that
the
appellants
took
yesterday
in
sibron.
i
don't
care
on
what
basis
the
court
chooses
to
affirm
this
conviction.
i'll
be
quite
honest,
if
the
court
does
not
see
that
it
is
necessary
to
come
to
this
point
i
don't
press
it
upon
the
court.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
a
great
deal
will
depend
on
i
should
think
anyway
the
interpretation
that
you
would
give
to
the
expression
public
place,
i
think
it
might.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir
i
think
so.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don't
this
being
applied
your
honor,
because
when
you
say
regular
it
imports
a
certain
prescribed
or
preordained
course
of
conduct
and
it's
not
--
i
don't
think
to
be
anticipated
that
in
a
preordained
way
or
a
preregulated
way
that
suspicious
circumstances
are
going
to
occur,
which
will
make
this
a
necessary
or
a
routine
thing
or
a
4
o'clock
every
afternoon
affair.
a
stolen
car
for
example
i
should
assume
yes
that
it
would
be
done
on
a
routine
preordained
basis
because
a
policeman
is
to
be
expected
to
be
able
to
see
a
stolen
car.
i
have
heard
a
great
many
people
say
here
that
is
the
subjective
determination
of
the
officer
and
i
would
like
to
answer
that
point
because
i
just
cannot
believe
that
this
court
is
prepared
to
decide
that
what
a
police
officer
decides
on
the
streets
is
the
very
last
word
in
the
point,
because
the
fact
that
we
stand
here
this
morning
debating
the
reasonableness
of
what
samuel
l.
lasky
did
in
the
hallway
of
a
public
building
in
mount
vernon
in
july
of
1964
certainly
gives
the
lie
to
any
suggestion
that
the
policeman
is
the
final
arbiter
of
the
thing.
by
reason
of
this
court's
determination
in
mapp
against
ohio
and
miranda
against
arizona,
new
york
has
now
developed,
something
they
never
had
before,
a
workable,
practical
daily
routine
whereby
the
admissibility
of
evidence
prior
to
a
trial
is
decided
upon
and
passed
upon
as
a
legal
question.
there's
nothing
so
amorphous
as
reasonable
grounds
for
anything.
so
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
a
policeman's
capacity
to
decide
what
is
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed,
i
see
no
reason
for
withdrawing
from
him,
the
acumen
to
decide
when
there's
reasonable
ground
to
suspect
because
on
the
following
morning,
a
court
will
convene
some
place
in
that
jurisdiction
who
will
pass
on
whether
or
not
this
officer
had
these
reasonable
grounds
to
suspect.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
he
made
that
equation
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
don't
think
that
he
intended
by
that
to
indicate
that
this
police
officer
was
not
going
to
be
called
into
account.
now
it
may
very
well
be
that
he
did
say
that
reasonable
suspicion,
which
has
to
be
acted
upon
immediately
will
arise
more
quickly
or
more
perceptibly
in
the
eyes
of
an
experienced
police
officer.
i
don't
think
he
said
that
we're
going
to
accept
this
police
officer's
determination
blind.
i
don't
think
he
intended,
i'm
sure
he
didn't
intend.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor
i
hesitate
very
long
to
tell
this
court
that
it's
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
something.
but
if
the
court
decides
that
the
way
to
curtail
unwarranted
frisks
and
searches
by
police
officers
where
there's
no
evidence
found
is
to
tell
them
that
they
will
suppress
the
evidence
which
is
not
found,
i
think
perhaps
the
court
maybe
disappointed.
because
for
example,
if
it
is
to
be
decided
by
some
municipal
police
agency
that
the
very
fact
that
a
police
officer
will
go
out
and
just
if
i
may
be
excused
for
using
a
police
expression
roused
everybody
insight,
on
the
theory
that
if
these
people
know
they
are
subject
to
being
searched,
they
won't
carry
guns,
they
won't
carry
a
contraband
equipment.
if
this
is
going
at
some
point,
at
some
place
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
be
an
official
policy
that
is
going
to
continue
to
be
an
official
police
policy
because
they
won't
be
doing
it
for
prosecutor
purposes,
they
will
be
doing
it
for
purposes
of
control
and
it
won't
get
to
us.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no
your
honor
we
won't.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
--
saying
that
this
statute
does
not
authorize
a
search
and
i'd
like
to
return
to
that
point
for
a
minute
because
there's
there
the
seed
of
why
perhaps
in
this
particular
case
an
exclusionary
role
is
perhaps
not
going
to
be
as
effective
as
it
was
in
mapp
against
ohio.
this
statute
basically
and
truly
only
authorizes
a
stop.
this
was
designed
to
give
a
police
officer
a
weapon
to
use
in
that
very
large
area
between
total
innocence
and
likely
guilt
and
all
was
stopped
or
i'm
sorry,
all
the,
all
of
the
frisk
or
search
depending
on
which
word
you
prefer,
purports
to
do
is
to
give
the
police
officer
a
way
of
disarming
the
person
whom
he
has
stopped.
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
can
look
into
his
shoes,
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
can
conduct
a
search
of
the
interior
of
his
clothing,
it
does
not
mean
and
most
especially
is
this
case
is
illustrative
of
that
it,
it
does
not
mean
that
this
police
officer
may
look
for
evidence.
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
mr.
justice
marshall
has
pointed
out,
this
wasn't
his
city,
it
wasn't
his
responsibility,
he
had
to
go
far
out
of
this
way
to
do
what
he
did
in
this
case.
so
it's
fairly
apparent
that
he
was
not
looking
for
evidence.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir,
we
would.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir,
we
would
take
the
position
if
that
was
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
for
the
reason
your
honor
that
as
a
basic
proposition,
as
a
search
may
not
be
justified
by
what
it
turns
up
it
may
not
be
condemned
by
what
it
turns
up.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no
sir,
i
do
not
say
that.
if,
for
example,
a
police
officer
approaches
someone
and
he
frisks
him
that's
all
that
this
section
purports
to
authorize
him
to
do.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
well,
let's
call
it
a
search
then.
i
mean,
i
don't
want
to
dodge
an
issue
for
a
word.
let's
say
that
we
assume
that
this
officer
has
the
right
to
search
an
external
--
exterior
search
of
this
individual
and
he
finds
as
the
officer
did
in
this
case
what
he
has
reason
to
believe
is
a
weapon.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
grant
you
that
your
honor
and
i
was
assuming
perhaps
erroneously
and
if
i
have
made
gratuitous
assumption
i
withdraw
it.
i
was
assuming
your
honor
that
the
glassine
envelope
of
narcotics
was
found
under
such
circumstances
as
would
have
permitted
the
officer
to
go
after
what
he
thought
was
a
gun.
i
do
not
think
so
that
if
that
for
example,
a
glassine
packet
of
narcotics
was
found
in
the
cuff
of
this
man's
pants,
i
think
it's
extremely
unlikely
that
he
would
be
looking
for
a
weapon
in
the
cuff
of
this
man's
pants.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
think
if
the
court
will
permit
me
to
make
the
assumption
that
the
officer
has
the
right
to
reach
into
that
pocket
to
recover
what
he
reasonably
believes
is
a
gun.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no,
your
honor,
but
then
he
has
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
a
crime
is
being
committed
in
his
presence.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i'm
not
shifting
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
think
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
don't
think
under
those
circumstances
he
could
use
the
narcotics.
however
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor,
it's
in
the
record,
he
felt
a
hard,
a
hard
object
which
could
have
been
a
knife.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
do
say
that,
yes
sir
because
if
the
search
was
reasonable
at
its
incidence,
when
it
began
if
was
reasonable
then
what
it
turns
up
equally
should
be
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
right
of
search
that
attached
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no
sir,
because
i
think
it's
an
artificial
comprise.
either
the
man
has
the
right
to
search
or
he
has
not
got
the
right
to
search.
if
he
has
not
got
the
right
to
search
then
nothing
that
comes
out
of
that
pocket
can
be
introduced.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
because
your
honor
i
am
assuming
perhaps
again
without
any
authority
for
doing
so
that
there
is
no
weapon
that's
going
to
be
found
in
cuffs
of
the
pants.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir
but
the
comprise
that
this
court
may
make
in
this
area
is
going
to
last
longer
than
my
comprise.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
it
could
be
so
interpreted
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
so
because
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
in
this
case.
i
think
the
statute
gives
this
man
the
right
to
protect
himself,
that's
all
it's
intended
to
do.
now
if
you
give
an
officer
authority
to
search
for
and
examine
for
the
presence
of
a
weapon
it
makes
no
sense
if
you
don't
give
him
a
corresponding
authority
to
remove
that.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
if
you
acknowledge
his
right
to
go
after
the
weapon
and
if
in
the
same
pocket
he
finds
other
contraband
yes,
i
think
it's
admissible.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
your
honor.
i
would
think
that
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
it
is.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
that's
what
the
statute
says
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
your
honor
i
have
to
go
further
perhaps
in
this
case
would
insist
that
i
do.
but
if
when
he
removes
the
gun
he
may
then
place
this
person
under
arrest
and
conduct
a
general
search
pursuant
to
the
authority
conferred
upon
him
by
that
arrest.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir
he
is,
but
he
is
also,
standing
in
the
presence
of
commission
of
a
crime.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
essentially
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
that's
what
he
is
out
there
for
your
honor,
to
detect
crime
and
to
prevent
crime
where
that's
possible.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir,
pursuant
to
the
arrest,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
not
the
formalities
which
new
york
has
imposed
your
honor
no
sir,
because
we
deal
with
43
different
police
departments
on
our
country.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
none
that
i'm
aware
of
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
seems
extremely
unlikely.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes
sir,
i
have
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no
sir
i
don't.
mr.
chief
justice
i
more
or
less
committed
myself
to
get
mr.
siegel
a
few
minutes,
i'll
differ
to
him
if
there
is
time
your
honor.
