justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
we
find,
one
that
he
did
not
have
reasonable
grounds
to
stop
it
and
two
he
most
certainly
didn't
have
any
ground
to
frisk
him,
it
was
based
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
finkel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
if
a
ordinary
citizen
is
stopped
at
night
but
nobody
on
the
street
but
him
and
the
policeman
who
is
armed,
that
he
is
know
that
he's
free
to
walk
away?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what
you've
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
there's
no
different
for
you
and
i
the
reasonableness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
finkel
would
it
satisfy
you
if
we
said
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
we
find
that
this
case
should
be
reversed
because
this
is
not
a
stop
and
frisk
case
as
such
and
because
of
what
the
state
has
said
and
for
that
reason
we
reverse
and
another
thing
we
also
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
constitution
provision
is
violated
by
a
policeman
stopping
a
citizen
temporarily
and
asking
for
his
name?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
policeman
is
standing
out
in
front
of
this
building
at
this
time
of
day
and
the
citizen
who
happened
to
be
a
congressman
in
united
states
comes
by
and
the
policeman
says,
“excuse
me,
what
is
your
name?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
that
this
statute
breaks
precedent
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood

yes
or
no.
justice
thurgood

[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
he
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
in
the
statute
says
that
an
officer
could
take
him
out
physically?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
instead
of
asking
us
to
declare
unconstitutional
this
statute,
which
statute
where
its
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
other
[inaudible][laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
on
the
peters
case
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
new
york
stop-and-frisk
law
apply
when
a
new
york
officer
is
living
in
white
plains
and
he
stops
a
man
in
white
plains?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
think
it
does
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
with
albany?
justice
thurgood
marshall
rochester,
syracuse,
you
mean
the
police
officer
can
go
any
place
in
the
state
and
stop
somebody
and
frisk
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
don't
you
think
peters
is
a
probable
cause.
don't
you
think
a
man
has
a
probable
cause
if
somebody
is
tinkering
with
his
door,
trying
to
break-in
that
he
has
the
right
to
go
out
and
see
what's
going
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
if
he
hears
somebody
tinkering
with
his
door,
he
looks
for
people,
and
he
sees
a
man
there,
that
he
hasn't
got
probable
cause
to
stop
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
question
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
isn't
that
what
happened
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
do
we
get
to
stop
and
frisk
now,
he
had
probable
cause?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mbut
if
there
is
probable
cause,
they
don't
get
to
the
stop
and
frisk
statute,
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree
that
if
we
think
that
this
was
a
probable
cause
case,
we
are
prevented
from
passing
on
the
constitutionality
of
stop
and
frisk
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
peters
didn't
the
man
have
him
by
the
collar?
justice
thurgood
marshall
its'
forced
custody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
a
great
problem
with
that.
the
officer
has
suspicion
that
this
man
is
engaged
in
selling
narcotics
and
he
is
the
most
casual
milk
toast
type
of
guy
you
ever
laid
eyes
on.
so
he
has
the
right
to
frisk
him
or
isn't
it
true
that
he
only
gets
the
right
to
frisk
if
he
reasonably
thinks
his
life
is
in
danger?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
the
limit,
that's
the
limit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
mr.
friedman
didn't
he
first
hear
first
somebody
or
a
sound
that
seemed
to
purport
that
somebody
was
tampering
with
his
door?
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
heard
a
sound
outside
of
his
door
which
obviously
was
not
a
normal
sound
or
he
wouldn't
have
attracted,
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
assume
the
police
officer
didn't
every
minute
on
the
minute
look
out
for
people.
can
i
assume
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
heard
a
sound,
which
attracted
his
attention
at
or
near
his
door.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
looked
out
the
peephole
and
saw
two
men
tiptoeing
around.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
doesn't
raise
any
suspicion
in
your
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
the
result
of
this
suspicion
he
went
out
to
try
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
outside
of
his
doorway.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
shut
the
door
and
lo
and
behold
he's
seeing
two
men
took
off,
he
still
doesn't
have
any
suspicion
about
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
mr.
duggan
what
about
this
point
that
everybody
seems
to
wanted
to
get.
this
is
new
york
city
policemen
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
either
all
of
these
phrases
about
field
arrest
and
field
investigations,
he
was
in
his
home
even
[inaudible].
he
was
enforcing
the
law
any
place,
he
was
on
duty,
so
how
does
he
get
authority
to
stop
and
frisk
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
missed
my
other
point,
he
wasn't
engaged
in
police
work,
he
was
showering?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
his
own
home,
and
it
implies
that
the
stop
and
frisking
applies
to
that,
suppose
he
is
playing
bridge
does
that
apply
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
he
police
24
a
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
he
on
duty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
take
real
good
consideration
of
words,
when
he
is
showering,
he
is
on
duty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
saying
it,
i'm
not?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
just
thinking.
and
my
whole
point
is
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
[inaudible]
stop
and
frisk
statute,
i
don't
understand
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
duggan
i
thought
you
said
there
is
no
thing,
well
to
question
the
man,
not
to
search
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
only
permission
that
the
officer
had
is
to
question
and
everything
else
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
officer
is
in
fear
of
his
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
he
pats
one
pocket
and
feels
a
gun,
he
has
the
right
to
go
in
that
pocket
and
take
that
gun
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
pats
the
next
pocket
and
he
feels
a
glassine
envelope,
he
has
a
right
to
take
that
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not,
i
thought
you
said
he
had
a
right
to,
once
he
started
searching
in
you
get
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
don't
go
there.
i
go
to
the
fact
that
he
has
a
right
to
protect
himself
and
once
he
disarms
him,
he
is
now
protected,
isn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
according
to
the
weapon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
only
came
about
because
of
the
right
to
talk,
all
this
comes
about
because
of
the
right
to
talk
to
the
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
his
only
right
is
to
talk
to
him,
you
don't
have
any
right
to
give
me
answer
to
that.
