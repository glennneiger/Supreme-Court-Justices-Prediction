an

then
it'd

justice

fortas
could
it
be
alright
to
have
in

persons
taking

stand
wearing
a

i

let

will
you
assume

that
you
are
a

in
this
criminal
case,
regardless
of
what
you
might
know
about
a

is
it
or
is
it
not
your
duty
as
a

to
make
an
investigation
of

now
how
can
you
make
that
investigate
--
if
that
is
so
that
the
fact
that
this
lawyer
knew
something
is
immaterial,
how
can
a

discharge
his
duty
to
his
client
to
make
an
investigation
if
he
doesn't
know
the
witness'
name?
justice

well,
that

lawyers
don't
operate

you
don't

out
in

that
will
destroy

i
don't

anything

that's
not
the
way
lawyers
suppose
to
go
about
the
performance
of
his
duty,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
a
prosecutor
who
puts
a
person
on
the
stand
and
permits
him
to
give
a
false
--
a
name
that
is
false
in
which
the

knows
it's
false?
