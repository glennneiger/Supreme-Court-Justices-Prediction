mr.
getty,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
refused
that
that
was
the
question
to
be
answered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
o'toole.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
o'toole,
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
o'toole,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
do
you
attach
any
of
the
constitutional
distinction
between
the
case
where
the
counsel
does
not
know
the
witness
and
where
the
--
a
case
where
he
have
represent
him
here,
is
that
material
to
the
decision
in
this
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
are
you
asking
us
for
(inaudible)
of
that
in
your
case,
you'd
still
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
ask
you
then
if
it's
important
in
this
case,
let
me
ask
you.
if
it
wasn't
in
this
case,
would
you
be
defend
--
here
defending
this
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't'
think
it
makes
any
difference
constitutionally
whether
he
knew
him
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
wanted
--
you
want
an
opinion
from
this
court
to
the
effect
that
not
with
--
that
even
if
the
counsel
had
not
known
this
man
at
all,
that
you
would
still
have
had
the
right
to
do
what
you
did
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
your
answer
to
what
justice
white
just
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
something,
i
just
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
not
cases
where
a
defendant
or
a
witness
on
the
stand
rather
has
been
convicted
of
contempt
and
put
into
jail
for
refusing
to
tell
what
his
name
is
or
where
he
lives?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
how
do
you
distinguish
those
cases
from
this?
even
though
he
claims
a
privilege?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not,
a
witness
is
a
witness,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
whether
he's
a
witness
for
the
government
or
a
witness
for
the
defendant,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
whether
he's
an
informant
or
whether
he's
just
an
observer,
he's
a
witness,
as
a
witness,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
isn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright
then,
what's
the
distinction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
(inaudible)
of
the
prosecutor
was
brought
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wasn't
it
(inaudible)
if
they
put
a
man
on
the
stand
and
have
him
say
that
his
name
was
jordan
but
it
wasn't
jordan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
he
thought
it
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
his
true
name,
--
if
he
thought
it
was
his
true
name,
why
would
he
object
to
the
defense
asking
him
what
his
true
name
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
he
thought
it
was
his
true
name,
why
wouldn't
he
let
him
say,
“yes
my
true
name
is
jordan”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
you
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
the
same
reasoning,
you
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
man
didn't
tell
the
counsel
for
the
defense
that
his
name
was
jordan
when
he
represented
him
on
a
prior
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
don't
you
assume
also
--
do
you
assume
also
that
the
counsel
for
the
defense
probably
thought
his
name
was
jordan
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
another
prosecutor
really
represent
him
when
he
was
a
paid
agent,
and
an
ex-convict
charged
with
--
also
charged
with
narcotics
violations,
and
he
in
this
preparation
of
the
case
wouldn't
he
know
him
just
as
well
as
the
defense
counsel
would
know
him
in
representing
him
when
he
was
charged
with
the
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
some
lawyers
do
that
too,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
police
courts.
i
have
seen
them,
many,
many
years.
i
know
they
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
take
them
right
out
of
this
room
and
represent
them
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
also
vouching
for
the
truth
and
what
you're
saying
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
far
is
you
know
it,
aren't
his
name?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
he
says
his
name
is
jordan
and
it
isn't,
doesn't
that
go
to
the
truth
of
his
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
i
--
irrespective
of
the
question
of
credibility,
why
isn't
this
man
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
entitled
to
know
whether
this
man
is
jordan
and
where
he
lives,
and
what
his
contact
has
been
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned?
why
isn't
the
man
entitled
to
know
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
just
suppose
that
there
are
two
gangs
of
narcotics
federation
in
chicago,
i
guess
that
he
is
at
that
time,
and
suppose
this
man
belong
to
one
and
this
witness,
jordan
belong
to
another.
and
if
his
name,
true
name,
and
his
identity
were
known
that
they
could
establish
that
this
man
was
working
with
the
other
gangs
to
put
the
--
this
man
out
of
business,
wouldn't
that
be
a
material
in
the
trial
--
the
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
source
of
narcotics
in
chicago?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
all
--
it
falls,
all
of
it
comes
from
one
source
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
too,
don't
you
know
that
it's
not
uncommon
for
one
narcotics
operator
to
even
murder
the
other
operators
in
the
same
business?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
--
who
are
trying
to
takeover
or
who
do
have
the
major
control
of
it.
why
do
you
say
to
us
that
there's
only
one
group?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well,
this
is
a
small
man.
this
is
a
small
man
too.
he
might
have
been
in
conflict
with
other
small
operators.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
very,
very
small
operator?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
entitled
to
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
information
concerning
witness
is
necessary
in
the
preparation
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
about
this
decision,
who's
--
who
is
entitled
to
make
that
decision
as
to
whether
that
information
is
required
in
the
preparation
of
the

chief
