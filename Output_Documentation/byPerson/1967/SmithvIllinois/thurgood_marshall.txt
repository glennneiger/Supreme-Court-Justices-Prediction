justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
getty,
you
really
mean
you
have
to
know
his
name?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
is
right
there.
you're
looking
at
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
you're
questioning
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
knew
him,
the
lawyer
knew
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
assume
that
the
lawyer
who
represents
a
man
knows
his
client.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
assume
though
--
--
there
is
no
finding
of
fact.
he
could
have
represented
him
as
james
jordan.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
he
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
he
knew
him
quite
well.
he
also
knew
--
all
the
other
times
he
testified.
isn't
that
also
in
the
record?
he
knew
the
other
person
that
this
man
had
testified
against.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
said,
“did
you
testify
in
such
and
such
a
name
case,
in
such
and
such
a
name
case?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
the
lawyer
knew
that
before
this
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
he
remember
the
name?
just
pull
it
out
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
he
asked
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
no.
my
point
mr.
getty
is
--
i'm
not
asserting
--
you
are
that
he
was
so
surprised
because
he's
the
one
who
asked
the
question,
that
this
is
not
your
real
name,
is
it?
i
don't
think
he
was
too
surprised.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
isn't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
says,
i
knew
him
and
i
represent
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
would
assume
from
that
that
he
knew
the
man,
and
he
knew
where
he
lived,
and
he
knew
something
about
him
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
because
he
represents
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
did
the
trial
last
mr.
getty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assuming
it
lasted
a
day,
and
you
got
the
full
name,
address
of
his
witness,
what
good
would
that
do
except
in
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
assuming
it
was
only
one
day,
it
wasn't
any
overnight.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
he
say
john
doe
(voice
overlap)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
after
you
produce
him
in
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
go
for
a
system
that
would
say
you
put
the
witness
on
the
stand
and
he
says,
“my
name
is
john
doe.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
do
you
say
that
this
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
his
credibility
couldn't
be
further
destroyed?
what
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
they
get
his
right
name
and
they
found
he's
been
convicted
of
perjury,
that
would
hurt
a
little
more,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
if
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
if
you're
balancing
rights,
when
you
first
put
him
on
the
stand,
you
should
have
told
the
court
that
this
man's
name
is
not
james
jordan.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don't
you
think
your
duty
bound
to
do
that?
the
man's
under
oath
and
testifies
that
this
is
my
name
and
really
is
not
his
name.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
you're
balancing
these
things
and
then
you
balance
them
all
under
the
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
changed
it
when
he
testified
three
or
four
times,
he
just
makes
a
habit
of
testifying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
