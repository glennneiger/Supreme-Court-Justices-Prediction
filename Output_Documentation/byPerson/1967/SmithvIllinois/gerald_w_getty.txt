mr.
gerald
w.
getty
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
of
fleming
smith
that
originated
in
illinois
and
has
taken
on
appeal
from
the
illinois
appellate
court.
the
question
involved
here
is
the
constitutional
provision
namely
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
part
which
states
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
we
are
also
concerned
about
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
question
as
we
see
it
presented
for
review
is,
should
the
informer's
privilege
be
permitted
to
encroach
upon
the
accused
sixth
amendment
right
to
be
confronted
by
witnesses
against
him.
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
are
--
as
the
normal
case
in
a
narcotic
case
where
an
addict
is
induced
or
the
addict
tells
a
police
where
he
can
supposedly
make
a
purchase
and
this
particular
addict
was
searched
and
then
escorted
by
two
policemen
to
a
restaurant
on
the
south
side
of
chicago,
and
there,
this
person
by
the
name
of
james
jordan,
and
we
do
find
from
the
record
that
this
is
not
his
correct
name,
did
enter
the
restaurant
and
it
is
alleged
and
he
did
testify
that
he
made
a
purchase
of
narcotics
from
one
fleming
smith
in
that
restaurant.
the
two
policemen
are
outside
of
the
restaurant
and
certainly
could
not
observed
whether
he
did
or
did
not
make
a
purchase
and
they
never
testified
to
such
things
in
the
record.
the
person,
james
jordan,
testified
on
the
stand
that
he
made
the
purchase
from
fleming
smith.
but
when
he
was
cross-examined
and
asked
whether
his
name
was
james
jordan,
there
was
an
objection
and
further
it
was
elicited
finally
that
his
name
was
not
james
jordan.
and
when
it
was
asked
whether
--
what
his
name
was,
there
was
an
objection
and
his
name
was
never
disclosed.
at
that
point,
though
they
had
produced
this
witness
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
it
was
denied,
denied
the
facts
and
the
defendant
to
know
the
person
that
was
accusing
him.
they
took
--
attempted
to
elicit
the
address
of
james
jordan
and
there
was
an
objection
and
that
was
never
disclosed.
when
fleming
smith
took
the
stand,
he
denied
any
of
the
pur
--
of
the
sale
of
narcotics
to
james
jordan.
fleming
smith
admitted
that
he
was
an
addict
and
when
he
was
arrested,
sometime
after
james
jordan
left
the
restaurant
on
february
28th,
1964,
he
did
have
a
packet
of
narcotics
on
him.
he
also
had
four
single
dollar
bill
on
him
that
had
been
marked
money.
the
police
at
the
time
that
james
jordan
or
just
prior
thereto
entered
--
that
james
jordan
entered
the
restaurant,
did
give
him
six
$1
bills
that
were
marked
and
four
quarters.
the
purchase
according
to
james
jordan
was
for
$4
and
75
cents,
a
$5-bag.
the
four
quarters
were
never
found
on
fleming
smith.
fleming
smith
explains
in
the
trial
the
reason
and
why
he
had
the
four
$1
bill
is
that
he
had
just
prior
thereto
paid
for
a
restaurant
bill
and
received
them
in
change.
so
that
fleming
smith
at
all
times
denied
the
sale.he
said
that
james
jordan
did
approach
him,
he
said
he
had
no
narcotics
for
sale
but
referred
him
to
one
herbert
simpson
in
the
rear
of
this
restaurant.
now
the
state
in
their
brief
presents
the
question,
does
the
constitution
require
that
the
true
identity
and
present
address
of
a
governmental
informant
be
disclosed
on
cross-examination?
and
our
answer
to
that
is
yes,
when
it
is
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
type
of
informer
that
merely
points
the
finger
of
suspicion
that
the
police
depend
upon
for
information,
that
type
of
person
gives
information
to
the
police
and
there
is
a
flow
of
information
and
we
realized
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
great
scientific
detection
apparatus
that
law
enforcement
does
have,
the
informant.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
there
is
some
evidence
that
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
there's
never
--
oh,
the
counsel?
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes,
he
did
represent
him
but
never
--
it
might
have
been
as
james
jordan.
we
have
a
right
to
assume
that.
we
know
--
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here
that
shows
that
he
represented
him
by
any
other
name.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
now
it
is
our
position
that
where
there
is
an
issue
of
guilt
as
distinguished
from
that
type
of
informer
that
informs
but
never
actually
testifies
against
the
defendant.
that
type
of
informer
that
merely
informs,
merely
gives
information
in
order
to
keep
this
flow
of
information,
in
order
to
protect
as
the
state
always
wants
them
protected,
this
informant
under
the
case
is
we
believe
there
--
they
do
not
have
to
disclose
their
name
and
address
or
if
you
please
their
identity.
however
we
have
a
different
problem
where
on
a
question
of
guilt
and
the
man
is
produced,
don't
we
have
the
right
to
know
who
this
witness
is
that
is
presented
against
the
defendant?
the
right
to
know
who
our
accusers
are,
and
that
is
the
issue
because
this
person
then
becomes
a
material
witness
and
we
should
not
be
prevented
from
having
a
full
cross-examination,
because
to
have
a
full
cross-examination,
we
must
know
who
we
are
cross-examining.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
we
have
to
know
his
name.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
that's
merely
gazing
on
somebody.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
we're
questioning
him.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
there's
a
statement
that
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
there
is
no
find
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
there's
also
information
that
he
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
--
that
he
knew
him
as
fishbait
in
there.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
he
knew
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
there
was
a
couple
of
occasions
there.
this
man
was
an
informer
and
he
apparently
did
testify
against
others.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
if
there
is
--
there's
a
possibility
that
he
did.
i
never
in
this
record
was
firmly
convinced
that
mr.
pride
actually
knew
this
man,
knew
his
correct
name.
i
think
mr.
pride
was
astonished
when
he
found
out
that
his
name
wasn't
james
jordan
because
we
don't
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
--
find
him
with
the
next
name,
“isn't
your
name
john
jones?”
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
it
was
never
a
finding
of
fact
that
he
knew
him
by
any
other
name,
that's
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
and
i
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
think
the
real
issue
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
would
say
this
that
he
probably
knew
something
about
him
because
there
is
evidence
or
indication
here
they
represented
him.
whether
he
knew
him
by
his
right
name,
whether
he
knew
where
he
actually
lived,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
there
is
still
isn't
any
evidence
that
he
actually
did
know
his
name
and
confront
him
with
his
correct
name.
i
think
he
was
at
the
end
of
the
line
that
he
didn't
know
his
right
name
and
he
didn't
know
where
this
man
lived.
and
these
narcotic
addicts
always
go
by
incorrect
names,
not
their
real
true
given
names.
that's
been
the
experiences
that
i
have
witnessed
and
been
involved
with.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
by
that
cross-examination,
it
was
superficial.
here,
he
brought
all
it
up,
but
everything
he
said
was
what
james
jordan
wanted
him
to
know.
james
jordan
said
that
he
had
been
in
the
penitentiary.
but
with
his
correct
name
and
an
address,
we
might
have
found
out
that
he
had
been
in
the
penitentiary
or
in
several
penitentiaries.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
and
we
might
have
found
out
that
there
was
more
charges
pending
against
him
such
as
he
had
a
charge
--
that
probably
he
would
be
a
witness
in
the
case
of
herbert
simpson,
the
man
that
fleming
smith
directed
him
to.
we
might
have
found
out
that
he
had
been
in
the
mental
institution
before.
we
might
have
found
out
that
he
was
in
custody
of
the
police.
we
might
have
found
out
that
he
was
testifying
because
he
was
going
to
receive
immunity.
we
might
have
found
out
--
those
things
that
are
very
important
that
might
have
tipped
the
scales
in
favor
of
fleming
smith
before
the
trier
of
fact
in
this
case.
it's
not
just
that
he
was
an
addict,
not
just
that
he
had
been
in
the
penitentiary
before,
but
all
those
other
things
that
could
have
been
brought
by
knowing
his
true
name
and
his
true
address.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
found
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
we
know
that
this
was
not
his
true
name.
we
know
that
he
is
even
lying
on
the
stand.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
that
was
all
shown.
that
was
all
shown
that
this
was
not
his
correct
name.
but
without
his
name,
without
his
address,
we
can't
find
out
in
what
other
theater
of
activity
he
was
engaged
in
by
investigation.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
this
was
before
a
court
or
a
judge.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
it
was
southport,
i
stand
corrected,
instead
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
don't
think
he
was
permitted
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
don't
think
he
was
permitted
to
state
whether
he
had
gone
in
southport.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
no,
he
didn't.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
stand
corrected,
it
was
southport.
i
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
had
another
case
where
it
was
fishbait.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
southport,
yes.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
no,
he
never
did.
he
never
did.
so
here,
mr.
pride
is
using
this
nickname
and
probably
it's
something
that
he
doesn't
even
know
whether
he
was
known
by
it.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes.
now
it
has
been
indicated
in
some
of
the
following
cases
which
is
the
reasoning
and
we
feel
is
the
correct
reasoning
that
we
have
approached
this
case
in,
and
it's
the
roviaro
versus
the
u.s.
,
1957
case,
353
u.s.
and
there
where
there
was
a
witness
and
it
was
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
it
was
determined
that
this
was
a
material
witness
and
that
this
witness
should
be
disclosed.
and
there
it
was
distinguished
also
that
the
--
on
the
--
where
there's
an
informant
on
probable
cause
as
to
whether
there
was
a
good
arrest.
there
the
police
officer,
if
has
received
information
from
this
informant,
then
he
would
not
have
to
disclose
the
name,
the
address,
the
identity
of
his
informant.
there
we
find
a
distinction
between
probable
cause
and
where
there
is
a
question
of
the
--
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
or
there
is
an
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
then
the
identity
of
this
informer
must
be
disclosed.
also
in
a
recent
case,
the
same
distinction
in
the
case
of
mccray
versus
illinois
decided
march
of
1967.
there,
that
case
was
affirmed
because
it
was
found
by
this
court
that
it
was
on
the
issue
of
probable
clause
but
that
if
it
had
been
an
issue
where
there
--
an
issue
of
guilt
and
this
informer
had
been
a
material
witness,
then
there
should
be
disclosure
of
that
informant.
also
in
the
alford
versus
the
u.s.
,
1931
282
illinois,
in
that
case
where
it
was
refused
to
disclose
the
address
of
a
material
witness.
on
that
particular
point
alone,
the
case
was
reversed.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
it
has
to
do
with
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
it
had
to
do
with
the
cross-examination.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
merely
on
a
stifling
cross-examination.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
that's
right.
it
is
federal
--
however
in
pointer
versus
texas,
1965
380
u.s.
,
there,
this
court
where
they
merely
used
--
didn't
produce
a
witness
but
used
his
transcript,
it
was
there
decided
that
this
was
a
constitutional
violation.
it
wouldn't
be
due
process.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
don't
know.
i
think
maybe
possibly
a
day,
a
day
and
half.
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
it
be
--
surprised
what
you
can
do
overnight.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
you
can
ask
for
time,
if
you
get
it,
as
for
time,
maybe
24
hours.
you
can't
tell
what
you're
going
to
discover
when
you
have
certain
information.
enough
and
what
that
information,
you
can't
tell
what
you're
going
to
be
able
to
disclose
with
that
knowledge
on
cross-examination.
i
have
found
that
out
in
the
trial
cases.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes,
i
state
it.
i
thought
it
was
a
day
and
a
day
and
a
half,
two-day
trial.
well,
now
though
--
that
is
the
issue
your
honors.
it's
a
question
of
--
on
a
question
of
guilt
that
the
identity,
not
only
the
production
but
the
identity
of
the
witness
should
be
disclosed,
where
it's
only
on
probable
cause
then
it
would
not
be
necessary
and
that
is
the
law,
we
know
that,
that
the
informer
may
not
be
disclosed.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
briefly
to
answer
mr.
o'toole,
it's
our
position
and
has
been
our
position
in
the
brief
that
once
the
state
has
produced
a
witness
that
they
lose
any
governmental
privilege.
and
that
to
make
the
sixth
amendment
meaningful
and
that
we
have
a
right
to
know
the
witnesses
that
are
presented
against
the
accused,
to
make
it
meaningful,
then
we
--
it
is
basic
that
we
should
at
least
know
the
name
and
address
of
the
witness
presented
against
the
defendant
as
to
who
is
to
decide
whether
what
to
do
with
the
name
and
the
address,
what
to
investigate
should
lie
with
the
defense
so
that
we
can
properly
defend
the
man
that
is
accused.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
of
fleming
smith
that
originated
in
illinois
and
has
taken
on
appeal
from
the
illinois
appellate
court.
the
question
involved
here
is
the
constitutional
provision
namely
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
part
which
states
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
we
are
also
concerned
about
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
question
as
we
see
it
presented
for
review
is,
should
the
informer's
privilege
be
permitted
to
encroach
upon
the
accused
sixth
amendment
right
to
be
confronted
by
witnesses
against
him.
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
are
--
as
the
normal
case
in
a
narcotic
case
where
an
addict
is
induced
or
the
addict
tells
a
police
where
he
can
supposedly
make
a
purchase
and
this
particular
addict
was
searched
and
then
escorted
by
two
policemen
to
a
restaurant
on
the
south
side
of
chicago,
and
there,
this
person
by
the
name
of
james
jordan,
and
we
do
find
from
the
record
that
this
is
not
his
correct
name,
did
enter
the
restaurant
and
it
is
alleged
and
he
did
testify
that
he
made
a
purchase
of
narcotics
from
one
fleming
smith
in
that
restaurant.
the
two
policemen
are
outside
of
the
restaurant
and
certainly
could
not
observed
whether
he
did
or
did
not
make
a
purchase
and
they
never
testified
to
such
things
in
the
record.
the
person,
james
jordan,
testified
on
the
stand
that
he
made
the
purchase
from
fleming
smith.
but
when
he
was
cross-examined
and
asked
whether
his
name
was
james
jordan,
there
was
an
objection
and
further
it
was
elicited
finally
that
his
name
was
not
james
jordan.
and
when
it
was
asked
whether
--
what
his
name
was,
there
was
an
objection
and
his
name
was
never
disclosed.
at
that
point,
though
they
had
produced
this
witness
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
it
was
denied,
denied
the
facts
and
the
defendant
to
know
the
person
that
was
accusing
him.
they
took
--
attempted
to
elicit
the
address
of
james
jordan
and
there
was
an
objection
and
that
was
never
disclosed.
when
fleming
smith
took
the
stand,
he
denied
any
of
the
pur
--
of
the
sale
of
narcotics
to
james
jordan.
fleming
smith
admitted
that
he
was
an
addict
and
when
he
was
arrested,
sometime
after
james
jordan
left
the
restaurant
on
february
28th,
1964,
he
did
have
a
packet
of
narcotics
on
him.
he
also
had
four
single
dollar
bill
on
him
that
had
been
marked
money.
the
police
at
the
time
that
james
jordan
or
just
prior
thereto
entered
--
that
james
jordan
entered
the
restaurant,
did
give
him
six
$1
bills
that
were
marked
and
four
quarters.
the
purchase
according
to
james
jordan
was
for
$4
and
75
cents,
a
$5-bag.
the
four
quarters
were
never
found
on
fleming
smith.
fleming
smith
explains
in
the
trial
the
reason
and
why
he
had
the
four
$1
bill
is
that
he
had
just
prior
thereto
paid
for
a
restaurant
bill
and
received
them
in
change.
so
that
fleming
smith
at
all
times
denied
the
sale.he
said
that
james
jordan
did
approach
him,
he
said
he
had
no
narcotics
for
sale
but
referred
him
to
one
herbert
simpson
in
the
rear
of
this
restaurant.
now
the
state
in
their
brief
presents
the
question,
does
the
constitution
require
that
the
true
identity
and
present
address
of
a
governmental
informant
be
disclosed
on
cross-examination?
and
our
answer
to
that
is
yes,
when
it
is
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
type
of
informer
that
merely
points
the
finger
of
suspicion
that
the
police
depend
upon
for
information,
that
type
of
person
gives
information
to
the
police
and
there
is
a
flow
of
information
and
we
realized
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
great
scientific
detection
apparatus
that
law
enforcement
does
have,
the
informant.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
there
is
some
evidence
that
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
there's
never
--
oh,
the
counsel?
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes,
he
did
represent
him
but
never
--
it
might
have
been
as
james
jordan.
we
have
a
right
to
assume
that.
we
know
--
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here
that
shows
that
he
represented
him
by
any
other
name.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
now
it
is
our
position
that
where
there
is
an
issue
of
guilt
as
distinguished
from
that
type
of
informer
that
informs
but
never
actually
testifies
against
the
defendant.
that
type
of
informer
that
merely
informs,
merely
gives
information
in
order
to
keep
this
flow
of
information,
in
order
to
protect
as
the
state
always
wants
them
protected,
this
informant
under
the
case
is
we
believe
there
--
they
do
not
have
to
disclose
their
name
and
address
or
if
you
please
their
identity.
however
we
have
a
different
problem
where
on
a
question
of
guilt
and
the
man
is
produced,
don't
we
have
the
right
to
know
who
this
witness
is
that
is
presented
against
the
defendant?
the
right
to
know
who
our
accusers
are,
and
that
is
the
issue
because
this
person
then
becomes
a
material
witness
and
we
should
not
be
prevented
from
having
a
full
cross-examination,
because
to
have
a
full
cross-examination,
we
must
know
who
we
are
cross-examining.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
we
have
to
know
his
name.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
that's
merely
gazing
on
somebody.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
we're
questioning
him.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
there's
a
statement
that
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
there
is
no
find
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
there's
also
information
that
he
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
--
that
he
knew
him
as
fishbait
in
there.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
he
knew
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
there
was
a
couple
of
occasions
there.
this
man
was
an
informer
and
he
apparently
did
testify
against
others.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
if
there
is
--
there's
a
possibility
that
he
did.
i
never
in
this
record
was
firmly
convinced
that
mr.
pride
actually
knew
this
man,
knew
his
correct
name.
i
think
mr.
pride
was
astonished
when
he
found
out
that
his
name
wasn't
james
jordan
because
we
don't
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
--
find
him
with
the
next
name,
“isn't
your
name
john
jones?”
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
it
was
never
a
finding
of
fact
that
he
knew
him
by
any
other
name,
that's
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
and
i
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
think
the
real
issue
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
would
say
this
that
he
probably
knew
something
about
him
because
there
is
evidence
or
indication
here
they
represented
him.
whether
he
knew
him
by
his
right
name,
whether
he
knew
where
he
actually
lived,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
there
is
still
isn't
any
evidence
that
he
actually
did
know
his
name
and
confront
him
with
his
correct
name.
i
think
he
was
at
the
end
of
the
line
that
he
didn't
know
his
right
name
and
he
didn't
know
where
this
man
lived.
and
these
narcotic
addicts
always
go
by
incorrect
names,
not
their
real
true
given
names.
that's
been
the
experiences
that
i
have
witnessed
and
been
involved
with.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
by
that
cross-examination,
it
was
superficial.
here,
he
brought
all
it
up,
but
everything
he
said
was
what
james
jordan
wanted
him
to
know.
james
jordan
said
that
he
had
been
in
the
penitentiary.
but
with
his
correct
name
and
an
address,
we
might
have
found
out
that
he
had
been
in
the
penitentiary
or
in
several
penitentiaries.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
and
we
might
have
found
out
that
there
was
more
charges
pending
against
him
such
as
he
had
a
charge
--
that
probably
he
would
be
a
witness
in
the
case
of
herbert
simpson,
the
man
that
fleming
smith
directed
him
to.
we
might
have
found
out
that
he
had
been
in
the
mental
institution
before.
we
might
have
found
out
that
he
was
in
custody
of
the
police.
we
might
have
found
out
that
he
was
testifying
because
he
was
going
to
receive
immunity.
we
might
have
found
out
--
those
things
that
are
very
important
that
might
have
tipped
the
scales
in
favor
of
fleming
smith
before
the
trier
of
fact
in
this
case.
it's
not
just
that
he
was
an
addict,
not
just
that
he
had
been
in
the
penitentiary
before,
but
all
those
other
things
that
could
have
been
brought
by
knowing
his
true
name
and
his
true
address.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
found
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
we
know
that
this
was
not
his
true
name.
we
know
that
he
is
even
lying
on
the
stand.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
that
was
all
shown.
that
was
all
shown
that
this
was
not
his
correct
name.
but
without
his
name,
without
his
address,
we
can't
find
out
in
what
other
theater
of
activity
he
was
engaged
in
by
investigation.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
this
was
before
a
court
or
a
judge.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
it
was
southport,
i
stand
corrected,
instead
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
don't
think
he
was
permitted
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
don't
think
he
was
permitted
to
state
whether
he
had
gone
in
southport.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
no,
he
didn't.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
stand
corrected,
it
was
southport.
i
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
had
another
case
where
it
was
fishbait.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
southport,
yes.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
no,
he
never
did.
he
never
did.
so
here,
mr.
pride
is
using
this
nickname
and
probably
it's
something
that
he
doesn't
even
know
whether
he
was
known
by
it.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes.
now
it
has
been
indicated
in
some
of
the
following
cases
which
is
the
reasoning
and
we
feel
is
the
correct
reasoning
that
we
have
approached
this
case
in,
and
it's
the
roviaro
versus
the
u.s.
,
1957
case,
353
u.s.
and
there
where
there
was
a
witness
and
it
was
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
it
was
determined
that
this
was
a
material
witness
and
that
this
witness
should
be
disclosed.
and
there
it
was
distinguished
also
that
the
--
on
the
--
where
there's
an
informant
on
probable
cause
as
to
whether
there
was
a
good
arrest.
there
the
police
officer,
if
has
received
information
from
this
informant,
then
he
would
not
have
to
disclose
the
name,
the
address,
the
identity
of
his
informant.
there
we
find
a
distinction
between
probable
cause
and
where
there
is
a
question
of
the
--
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
or
there
is
an
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
then
the
identity
of
this
informer
must
be
disclosed.
also
in
a
recent
case,
the
same
distinction
in
the
case
of
mccray
versus
illinois
decided
march
of
1967.
there,
that
case
was
affirmed
because
it
was
found
by
this
court
that
it
was
on
the
issue
of
probable
clause
but
that
if
it
had
been
an
issue
where
there
--
an
issue
of
guilt
and
this
informer
had
been
a
material
witness,
then
there
should
be
disclosure
of
that
informant.
also
in
the
alford
versus
the
u.s.
,
1931
282
illinois,
in
that
case
where
it
was
refused
to
disclose
the
address
of
a
material
witness.
on
that
particular
point
alone,
the
case
was
reversed.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
it
has
to
do
with
--
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
it
had
to
do
with
the
cross-examination.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
merely
on
a
stifling
cross-examination.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
that's
right.
it
is
federal
--
however
in
pointer
versus
texas,
1965
380
u.s.
,
there,
this
court
where
they
merely
used
--
didn't
produce
a
witness
but
used
his
transcript,
it
was
there
decided
that
this
was
a
constitutional
violation.
it
wouldn't
be
due
process.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
i
don't
know.
i
think
maybe
possibly
a
day,
a
day
and
half.
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
it
be
--
surprised
what
you
can
do
overnight.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
well,
you
can
ask
for
time,
if
you
get
it,
as
for
time,
maybe
24
hours.
you
can't
tell
what
you're
going
to
discover
when
you
have
certain
information.
enough
and
what
that
information,
you
can't
tell
what
you're
going
to
be
able
to
disclose
with
that
knowledge
on
cross-examination.
i
have
found
that
out
in
the
trial
cases.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
yes,
i
state
it.
i
thought
it
was
a
day
and
a
day
and
a
half,
two-day
trial.
well,
now
though
--
that
is
the
issue
your
honors.
it's
a
question
of
--
on
a
question
of
guilt
that
the
identity,
not
only
the
production
but
the
identity
of
the
witness
should
be
disclosed,
where
it's
only
on
probable
cause
then
it
would
not
be
necessary
and
that
is
the
law,
we
know
that,
that
the
informer
may
not
be
disclosed.
mr.
gerald
w.
getty
briefly
to
answer
mr.
o'toole,
it's
our
position
and
has
been
our
position
in
the
brief
that
once
the
state
has
produced
a
witness
that
they
lose
any
governmental
privilege.
and
that
to
make
the
sixth
amendment
meaningful
and
that
we
have
a
right
to
know
the
witnesses
that
are
presented
against
the
accused,
to
make
it
meaningful,
then
we
--
it
is
basic
that
we
should
at
least
know
the
name
and
address
of
the
witness
presented
against
the
defendant
as
to
who
is
to
decide
whether
what
to
do
with
the
name
and
the
address,
what
to
investigate
should
lie
with
the
defense
so
that
we
can
properly
defend
the
man
that
is
accused.
