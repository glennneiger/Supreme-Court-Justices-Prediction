justice
potter
stewart
but
on
the
cross-examination,
it
was
brought
out
was
it
not?
the
defendant
counsel
was
allowed
to
bring
out
and
did
bring
out
that
this
man
going
by
the
name
of
james
jordan,
was
an
addict
at
that
time,
that
he
had
prior
convictions.
that
he
was
--
that
he
had
a
criminal
charge
then
pending
against
him.
that
he
was
being
paid
for
his
services
as
an
informer
and
that
james
jordan
was
an
assumed
name,
all
those
things
presumably
damaging
to
his
credibility.
what
more
do
you
suggest
to
--
if
they
found,
“well,
he
also
went
by
name
of
fishbait,”
that
was
brought
out,
and
let's
say
it's
also
been
brought
out,
“well,
i
also
go
out
by
the
name
of
john
smith,
tom
brown,
and
alfred
green,
what
would
that
of
help?
i
mean
why
--
it
was
shown
that
he
went
--
that
he
had
another
name
that
this
was
an
assumed
name,
his
criminal
record
were
shown,
his
addiction
of
narcotics
were
shown.
in
fact,
he
was
a
paid
informer
were
shown.
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
suggested,
it
was
also
shown
that
the
lawyer
in
fact
knew
who
he
was
having
serviced
as
his
employer,
what
more
could
have
been
brought
out?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
he
said
he
had
been
convicted
for
larceny,
and
he'd
been
convicted
of
burglary,
and
he
said
there
was
a
--
then
a
charge
pending
against
him.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
they
--
you
represented
to
us
that
its
typical
for
these
people
not
to
use
their
true
name.
justice
potter
stewart
he
testified
that
he's
gone
by
--
that
he
had
at
least
two
other
names.
justice
potter
stewart
one
fishbait
and
one
the
undisclosed
“real
name.”
i
don't
quite
see
how
all
of
this
speculative
information
could've
been
made
available
by
just
giving
one
of
his
--
perhaps
many
other
names.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
all
shown,
wasn't
it?

any.
