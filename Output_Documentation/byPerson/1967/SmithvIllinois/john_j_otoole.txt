mr.
john
j.
o'toole
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
that's
presented
in
this
case
is
actually
revolves
or
is
a
takeoff
from
rovario.
the
rovario
this
court
held
that
where
the
testimony
of
an
informant
--
the
merits
of
the
case
is
necessary
for
the
defense,
that
the
informant
must
be
disclosed.
however,
we
don't
think
that
this
is
a
--
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
intended
this
to
be
a
blanket,
unfettered
disclosure
of
all
informants.
i
believe
that
it's
needless
to
go
into
the
importance
of
informants
in
the
law
enforcement
field
where
necessity,
actual
necessity
that
we
have
this
court
has
recognized
at
that
time
and
time
again.
but
the
fact
remains
that
we
fully
admit
that
if
the
testimony,
the
identity
of
an
informant
is
necessary
to
allow
a
defendant
to
properly
defend
themselves,
we
agree
that
his
name
and
identity
should
be
revealed.
however,
in
this
situation
that
we
feel,
and
as
the
court
said
in
rovario,
each
case
should
be
considered
on
its
own
and
the
rights
of
the
people
balanced
against
the
rights
of
the
defendant.
now
in
this
situation,
the
defendant
took
the
stand
was
subjected
to
a
full
cross-examination,
the
majority
of
this
transcript
as
a
cross-examination
of
james
jordan,
the
only
thing
that
his
name
and
true
address
could
have
possibly
brought
out
with
facts
relating
to
his
credibility.
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
aptly
put
it,
how
could
his
credibility
been
more
destroyed
than
that
to
say
that
i
was
convicted
on
larceny,
spent
a
year
vandalia,
i
was
in
(inaudible)
for
burglary,
i
am
an
addict,
presently
an
addict,
i
had
a
shot
last
week,
(inaudible)
even
rolled
up
the
man's
sleeve
and
pointed
out
the
pinhole
marks
in
his
arm
in
front
of
the
judge.
the
judge
observed
this.
he
stated,
“i
am
presently
under
indictment.
i
come
up
in
one
month
for
trial,”
what
more
could
you
say?
this
man's
credibility
is
already
destroyed
as
far
as
it's
possible.
but
the
thing
that
the
petitioner
doesn't
mention
is
that
with
the
exception
of
the
actual
passage
of
the
narcotics
from
fleming
smith
to
james
jordan,
every
bit
of
a
testimony
of
fleming
smith
was
corroborated
by
two
police
officers.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
there's
a
big
difference.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
alright.
one
is,
if
you
put
a
mask
over
his
face,
you
don't
even
know
if
that
was
the
same
person
you
came
in
contact.
however
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
defendant?
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that
he
came
in
contact
with
(inaudible)
--
on
a
controlled
sale
of
narcotics.
now,
he
knows
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
this
--
that
if
gestational
features
are
not
necessary
for
the
defense
of
the
defendant,
yes,
i
think
you
could
put
a
mask.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no,
i
can't
really
take
that
position
mr.
justice,
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh!
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
we
think
that
this
is
a
very
important
factor
in
this
case
to
point
out
and
emphasize
the
fact
that
it
was
not
necessary
in
this
case
for
the
state
to
divulge
in
the
present
address
and
true
identity
of
this
informant.
now
the
only
decisions
had
actually
have
come
down.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
i
don't
think
--
that
is
a
controlling
factor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
it
adds
great
weight
to
our
argument
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
we
do
not
contend
that
together
with
the
fact
of
his
destroyed
credibility,
the
corroboration
of
his
testimony
and
the
fact
that
the
attorney
knew
him,
all
three
of
these
add
to
it
but
we
can
take
away
to
one
and
we
still
have
sufficient
reason
to
say
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
interest
of
the
state
of
illinois
is,
one,
to
protect
the
informant's
situation
and
the
informant
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that
was
an
alias.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
this
i
can't
say.
the
record
only
divulges
that
he
was
sworn
in
as
james
jordan.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
and
he
testified
that
this
was
his
name.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
he
did
not
say
that
he
testified
under
that
same
name.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
they
know
who
he
was.
i
mean
just
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
this
is
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
let
me
say
this
that
as
far
as
the
informant's
situation
goes,
that
once
an
individual
does
expose
himself
in
court,
he
is
open
for
retaliation.
now,
the
interest
the
state
has
is
that
if
we
don't
do
everything
we
possibly
can
within
the
constitutional
guideline
to
protect
the
informant,
we
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
an
informant.
now,
let's
just
give
the
one
example,
at
least,
sure
they
know
who
he
is.
but
maybe
they
don't
know
where
he
is
today.let's
not
give
him
his
present
address.
they're
not
playing
ball
games.
i
was
talking
with
mr.
judge
--
i
mean,
mr.
judge
(inaudible).
the
other
day,
we
sat
in
a
narcotics
court
in
cook
county
for
5
years
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
if
it's
necessary
for
the
defense,
yes.
in
this
case,
i
can't
say
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
under
normal
circumstances,
i
would
say
perfectly
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
in
this
circumstance,
i'd
say
definitely
no.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
an
alias.
this
is
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
excuse
me.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
haven't
answered
it
yet
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
unless
it
was
necessary
for
the
defense
--
for
the
defendant.
this
is
not
the
normal
situation
that
we
have
in
a
normal
trial.
what
we
have
here
is
we
have
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
and
i
say
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
for
truth
and
veracity?
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
here
is
a
man
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
but
it
depends
upon
the
circumstances
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
he
not
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
know,
but
you
don't
want
to
bring
in
these
other
things
now.
don't
bring
in
the
fact
that
this
lawyer
already
knew
because
you
want
to
put
that
aside.
you've
said
you
wanted
it
to
put
aside.
and
you
want
to
rule
that
wholly
aside
from
this
--
what
this
lawyer
knew.
now,
let's
just
take
it
without
--
what
the
lawyer
knew.
he
doesn't
know
anything.
and
he
doesn't
know
anything,
the
fellow
gets
up
and
says,
“i
won't
give
my
name
and
i
won't
give
my
address”.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
but
he
also
justifies
that
i'm
a
convicted
felon.
i'm
an
addict.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
am
presently
under
indictment.
i'm
being
paid
by
the
police.
i
think
his
credibility
is
pretty
well
attacked
right
there.
what
are
they
going
to
do?
what
are
they
going
to
find
out
with
his
present
address
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
we
had
a
lot
of
fights
with
the
defendant
was
that
the
defendant
can
tell
us
the
answer.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
(inaudible)
he
may
have
some
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
go
ahead.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
that's
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
point
that
is
in
this
case
is
that
the
name
and
address
can
lead
to
only
one
thing,
destruction
of
credibility
and
that
in
this
instance,
it
was
not
necessary
because
its
credibility
was
shattered
as
far
as
it
could
possibly
go.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
there
are
rules,
and
privileges,
and
rights
that
exist
with
the
people
too.
and
that
in
this
situation,
we
have
a
governmental
privilege
that
has
been
engrafted
since
the
first
case,
i
think
it
was
a
treason
case,
thomas
hardy
in
england
1792,
that
the
state,
the
government
has
a
right
for
your
benefit
--
for
my
benefit
to
protect
informants
so
we
have
a
flow
of
information.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
i'd
say.
i
think
we
ought
to
do
everything
possible
to
protect
informants,
if
we
don't
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
the
system
is
going
to
breakdown.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
if
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
his
true
name
is
not
necessary
for
his
defense,
i
submit
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
it
would
be
cumulative
--
any
evidence
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that'll
hurt
a
little
bit
more
but
it's
cumulative,
really.
oh,
this
is
a
situation
where
we
have
to
balance
the
rights.
this
isn't
a
situation
where
the
state
is
merely
refusing
to
do
it,
to
try
to
convict
someone.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
we're
trying
to
protect
the
system.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
agree
with
you
that
its
--
that
if
perhaps
it
was
an
alias,
i
can
see
no
harm
in
it
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
i
agree.
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
a
situation
that
is
similarly
akin
to
this
is
a
situation
of
where
a
person
might
invoke
the
right
of
self-incrimination
in
a
trial.
and
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
consistently
held
that
where
a
witness,
a
governmental
witness,
invokes
self-incrimination,
and
his
testimony
which
is
--
which
he
invokes
the
privilege,
only
goes
to
credibility
that
the
error
created
is
only
harmless.
now
this
is
the
cardillo
case
in
a
--
spells
this
out,
has
been
followed
consistently
by
nearly
every
circuit
court.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
there's
a
little
distinction
there.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that
there's
a
corollary
between
the
two.
true,
the
governmental
privilege
is
not
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
but
it
is
not
a
mere
evidentiary
matter
and
a
procedural
matter.
i
think
that
the
governmental
privilege
is
something
that
shouldn't
yield
too
easily,
and
i
fully
agree
and
i
don't
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
there
are.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
even
though
he
claims
--
the
situation
is
not
the
same.
in
those
situations,
we
don't
have
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
distinction
is
here
is
that
you
and
i
and
the
other
200
million
people
in
this
country
collectively
have
a
privilege
to
protect
the
informant's
situation
unless
it
is
necessary
for
the
defense
of
this
individual
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
what
has
--
the
defendant
here
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no.
i
think
that
on
the
facts
in
this
individual
case,
we
are
really
asking
two
things.
one,
let's
not
have
a
blanket
rule.
let's
not
have
a
universal
principle
that
where
we
have
a
participating
informant
that
he
must
in
all
situations
divulge
his
name
and
his
present
address.
but
rather,
that
in
keeping
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
rovario,
each
case
should
fall
--
arise
on
its
own
merits.
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
court
said
this,
“we
believe
that
no
fixed
rule
with
respect
to
disclosure
is
justifiable”.
the
problem
is
when
it
calls
for
balancing
of
the
public
interest
and
protecting
the
flow
of
information
against
the
individual's
right
to
prepare
his
defense.
we
ask
two
things.
truthfully,
if
you
reverse
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
situation,
that
would
be
a
loss.
but
it
would
not
be
damaging.
what
we
want,
and
what
we
want
to
take
back
in
illinois
and
i
think
for
the
benefits
of
all
the
states
is
the
fact
that
where
no
--
we
don't
want
a
universal
rule
in
such
where
we
have
a
participating
informant,
there
must
just
be
complete
unfettered
cross-examination
even
where
it
will
not
be
beneficial
to
the
defendant.
in
this
situation,
what
could
they
have
learned
really?
they
could
affect
his
credibility.
and
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
and
anything
that
he
do,
it
just
pile
more
to
it.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
i'm
--
excuse
me
for
going
beyond
the
realm.
but
what
i'm
talking
about
is
that
we
are
--
if
--
i
believe
there
are
situations
where
the
name
and
the
present
address
really
aren't
going
to
be
that
helpful
to
the
defendant.
where
on
a
(inaudible),
if
we
can
protect
the
name
and
the
present
whereabouts
of
an
informant,
we
are
bolstering
the
whole
system
because
we
are
showing
these
people
that
we
are
going
to
do
everything
we
possibly
can
to
protect
them.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no.
oh,
i'm
not
asking
for
that.
i
think
that
would
be
unreasonable.
what
i'm
asking
for
is
that
we
get
--
that
don't
have
a
rule
which
says
that
he
must
in
each
case
regardless
of
the
circumstances
the
facts
what
is
brought
out
in
the
cross-examination
that
he
be
required
to
give
his
name
and
present
address.
he
might
not
make
it
until
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
--
oh,
perhaps
i
assumed
too
much
but
i
thought
this
court
was
well-aware
of
the
fact
that
what
does
happen
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
correct.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
agree
with
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
agree
with
your
point
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
all
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
let's
give
him
every
break
we
can.
at
least
let's
do
that.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
mean
try
to
hide
his
identity
and
his
present
whereabouts,
let's
do
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
he's
in
the
courtroom
now,
but
where
is
he's
going
to
be
at
5
o'clock
or
10
o'clock
tonight.
this
is
the
problem.
but
i
agree
with
you,
that
once
he
exposes
himself,
that's
a
--
he
has
subjected
to
--
through
this
retaliation
but
let's
give
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
don't
think
he
could
buy
an
insurance
policy
your
honor,
that's
for
sure.
but
i
do
believe
this,
that
there
are
informants
that
are
useful
two,
three,
four,
or
five
years,
some
of
them.
some
of
them
move.
some
of
them
voluntarily
assign
themselves
(inaudible)
if
they're
an
addict.
and
there
are
cases
of
informants
that
do
not
befall
this
horrible
fate
as
befall
so
many
of
them.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
he
should
divulge
in
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
know.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
know
that
your
honor.
fortunately,
it
was
brought
out.
i
mean,
the
court
was
aware
of
it.
it
was
brought
out
in
cross-examination.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no,
no.
i
know
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
maybe
the
prosecutor
thought
that
was
his
real
name.
this
is
a
funny
situation
but
if
you
have
a
witness
or
an
informant
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
he
has
to
prosecute
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
because
to
protect
the
identity
of
the
informant.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
he
probably
didn't
want
the
petitioner
to
know
who
this
man
really
was.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
know,
your
honor,
it's
--
i
mean,
here's
the
point,
if
were
the
prosecutor
and
the
witness
might
tell
me
his
name
is
james
jordan.
i
might
believe
him.
i
might
not
believe
it.
i
have
no
way
of
really
knowing
if
that
is
his
name
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
especially
an
addict.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
mr.
martwick
conducted
himself
as
a
proper
attorney
in
that
--
therefore
i
have
to
assume
at
least
that
the
--
he
didn't
know
that
james
jordan
was
not
his
actual
name.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
counsel
for
the
defense
knew
him.
counsel
for
defense
probably
knew
his
right
name
because
he
had
represented
him
before.
that's
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
it's
the
fact
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
the
situation
in
cook
county
is
such
is
that
--
in
the
state
attorney's
office
and
attorney
might
have
--
you
know,
one
trial
right
after
another.
he
dropped
one
file,
pick
up
the
next
and
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
but
it's
very
difficult
sometimes
to
adequately
talk
to
your
witnesses
prior
to
the
presentation
of
your
case.
the
case
load
is
so
tremendous
at
cook
county
that
this
is
a
real
problem
as
the
--
but
i
cannot
assume
that
bob
martwick
did
not
conduct
himself
in
a
proper
way.
and
i
truthfully,
i
mean,
having
been
(inaudible)
myself
for
a
while,
i
really
--
if
somebody
tells
you,
“my
name
is
john
jones”.
that's
john
jones.
i
don't
know
who
he
is.
i
mean,
i
can't
--
i'm
--
true,
as
if
you
put
a
witness
on
a
stand,
you're
vouching
for
his
credibility
but
how
do
you
really
know?
you
don't.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
it
affects
his
credibility.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
if
it's
going
to
help
him,
yes,
he
isn't.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
if
it
is
going
to
be
of
aid
to
the
defendant,
yes.
if
it
isn't
going
to
be
merely
to
add
more
weight
to
the
--
to
his
already
practically
destroyed
credibility,
then
let's
balance
that
against
the
rights
that
we
possess.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
so
your
honor,
but
i
think
there's
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
there's
only
one
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
source
of
narcotics.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
seller
on
the
street
is
normally
an
addict.
the
people
that
are
taking
the
profit
out
of
narcotics
never
go
down
on
the
street
and
actually
sell
the
$5-bag
went
up
to
$16,
these
people
aren't
and
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
the
syndicate
is
the
sole
--
real
supplier
of
narcotics.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
sure
there
are
a
few
independent
small
operators
that
might
run
some
in
from
mexico,
marijuana
or
something
but
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
this
man
was
selling
narcotics
because
he
was
supporting
a
habit
and
that's
exactly
why
he
was
selling
narcotics,
fleming
smith.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right,
i
agree.
but
i
cannot
argue
against
the
fact
that
if
in
a
given
situation,
the
name
and
present
address
are
necessary
to
the
defendant.
i'd
say
that
the
state
should
be
required
to
reveal
his
identity.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
this
decision
has
to
be
made
at
the
trial
but
the
trial
have
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
the
state
would
always
take
the
position.
they
will
try
to
take
the
position
that
we
don't
have
to
reveal
it.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
don't
think
that
the
decision
lies
totally
within
the
defense
or
i
don't
think
it
lies
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
don't
think
it
lies
totally
with
the
defense
or
with
the
prosecution.
i
think
the
decision
has
to
be
made
at
trial
during
cross-examination
by
the
trial
judge
when
he
is
evaluating
the
facts
that
have
been
elicited
on
cross-examination.
and
then
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
make
the
ultimate
determination
on
whether
he
should
allow
the
governmental
privilege
to
be
invoked
or
whether
the
name
and
present
address
should
be
given
to
the
defendant
because
it'll
be
of
aid
to
him
in
his
defense.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
that's
presented
in
this
case
is
actually
revolves
or
is
a
takeoff
from
rovario.
the
rovario
this
court
held
that
where
the
testimony
of
an
informant
--
the
merits
of
the
case
is
necessary
for
the
defense,
that
the
informant
must
be
disclosed.
however,
we
don't
think
that
this
is
a
--
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
intended
this
to
be
a
blanket,
unfettered
disclosure
of
all
informants.
i
believe
that
it's
needless
to
go
into
the
importance
of
informants
in
the
law
enforcement
field
where
necessity,
actual
necessity
that
we
have
this
court
has
recognized
at
that
time
and
time
again.
but
the
fact
remains
that
we
fully
admit
that
if
the
testimony,
the
identity
of
an
informant
is
necessary
to
allow
a
defendant
to
properly
defend
themselves,
we
agree
that
his
name
and
identity
should
be
revealed.
however,
in
this
situation
that
we
feel,
and
as
the
court
said
in
rovario,
each
case
should
be
considered
on
its
own
and
the
rights
of
the
people
balanced
against
the
rights
of
the
defendant.
now
in
this
situation,
the
defendant
took
the
stand
was
subjected
to
a
full
cross-examination,
the
majority
of
this
transcript
as
a
cross-examination
of
james
jordan,
the
only
thing
that
his
name
and
true
address
could
have
possibly
brought
out
with
facts
relating
to
his
credibility.
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
aptly
put
it,
how
could
his
credibility
been
more
destroyed
than
that
to
say
that
i
was
convicted
on
larceny,
spent
a
year
vandalia,
i
was
in
(inaudible)
for
burglary,
i
am
an
addict,
presently
an
addict,
i
had
a
shot
last
week,
(inaudible)
even
rolled
up
the
man's
sleeve
and
pointed
out
the
pinhole
marks
in
his
arm
in
front
of
the
judge.
the
judge
observed
this.
he
stated,
“i
am
presently
under
indictment.
i
come
up
in
one
month
for
trial,”
what
more
could
you
say?
this
man's
credibility
is
already
destroyed
as
far
as
it's
possible.
but
the
thing
that
the
petitioner
doesn't
mention
is
that
with
the
exception
of
the
actual
passage
of
the
narcotics
from
fleming
smith
to
james
jordan,
every
bit
of
a
testimony
of
fleming
smith
was
corroborated
by
two
police
officers.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
there's
a
big
difference.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
alright.
one
is,
if
you
put
a
mask
over
his
face,
you
don't
even
know
if
that
was
the
same
person
you
came
in
contact.
however
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
defendant?
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that
he
came
in
contact
with
(inaudible)
--
on
a
controlled
sale
of
narcotics.
now,
he
knows
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
this
--
that
if
gestational
features
are
not
necessary
for
the
defense
of
the
defendant,
yes,
i
think
you
could
put
a
mask.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no,
i
can't
really
take
that
position
mr.
justice,
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh!
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
we
think
that
this
is
a
very
important
factor
in
this
case
to
point
out
and
emphasize
the
fact
that
it
was
not
necessary
in
this
case
for
the
state
to
divulge
in
the
present
address
and
true
identity
of
this
informant.
now
the
only
decisions
had
actually
have
come
down.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
i
don't
think
--
that
is
a
controlling
factor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
it
adds
great
weight
to
our
argument
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
we
do
not
contend
that
together
with
the
fact
of
his
destroyed
credibility,
the
corroboration
of
his
testimony
and
the
fact
that
the
attorney
knew
him,
all
three
of
these
add
to
it
but
we
can
take
away
to
one
and
we
still
have
sufficient
reason
to
say
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
interest
of
the
state
of
illinois
is,
one,
to
protect
the
informant's
situation
and
the
informant
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that
was
an
alias.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
this
i
can't
say.
the
record
only
divulges
that
he
was
sworn
in
as
james
jordan.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
and
he
testified
that
this
was
his
name.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
he
did
not
say
that
he
testified
under
that
same
name.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
they
know
who
he
was.
i
mean
just
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
this
is
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
let
me
say
this
that
as
far
as
the
informant's
situation
goes,
that
once
an
individual
does
expose
himself
in
court,
he
is
open
for
retaliation.
now,
the
interest
the
state
has
is
that
if
we
don't
do
everything
we
possibly
can
within
the
constitutional
guideline
to
protect
the
informant,
we
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
an
informant.
now,
let's
just
give
the
one
example,
at
least,
sure
they
know
who
he
is.
but
maybe
they
don't
know
where
he
is
today.let's
not
give
him
his
present
address.
they're
not
playing
ball
games.
i
was
talking
with
mr.
judge
--
i
mean,
mr.
judge
(inaudible).
the
other
day,
we
sat
in
a
narcotics
court
in
cook
county
for
5
years
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
if
it's
necessary
for
the
defense,
yes.
in
this
case,
i
can't
say
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
under
normal
circumstances,
i
would
say
perfectly
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
in
this
circumstance,
i'd
say
definitely
no.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
an
alias.
this
is
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
excuse
me.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
haven't
answered
it
yet
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
unless
it
was
necessary
for
the
defense
--
for
the
defendant.
this
is
not
the
normal
situation
that
we
have
in
a
normal
trial.
what
we
have
here
is
we
have
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
and
i
say
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
for
truth
and
veracity?
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
here
is
a
man
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
but
it
depends
upon
the
circumstances
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
he
not
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
know,
but
you
don't
want
to
bring
in
these
other
things
now.
don't
bring
in
the
fact
that
this
lawyer
already
knew
because
you
want
to
put
that
aside.
you've
said
you
wanted
it
to
put
aside.
and
you
want
to
rule
that
wholly
aside
from
this
--
what
this
lawyer
knew.
now,
let's
just
take
it
without
--
what
the
lawyer
knew.
he
doesn't
know
anything.
and
he
doesn't
know
anything,
the
fellow
gets
up
and
says,
“i
won't
give
my
name
and
i
won't
give
my
address”.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
but
he
also
justifies
that
i'm
a
convicted
felon.
i'm
an
addict.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
am
presently
under
indictment.
i'm
being
paid
by
the
police.
i
think
his
credibility
is
pretty
well
attacked
right
there.
what
are
they
going
to
do?
what
are
they
going
to
find
out
with
his
present
address
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
we
had
a
lot
of
fights
with
the
defendant
was
that
the
defendant
can
tell
us
the
answer.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
(inaudible)
he
may
have
some
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
go
ahead.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
that's
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
point
that
is
in
this
case
is
that
the
name
and
address
can
lead
to
only
one
thing,
destruction
of
credibility
and
that
in
this
instance,
it
was
not
necessary
because
its
credibility
was
shattered
as
far
as
it
could
possibly
go.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
there
are
rules,
and
privileges,
and
rights
that
exist
with
the
people
too.
and
that
in
this
situation,
we
have
a
governmental
privilege
that
has
been
engrafted
since
the
first
case,
i
think
it
was
a
treason
case,
thomas
hardy
in
england
1792,
that
the
state,
the
government
has
a
right
for
your
benefit
--
for
my
benefit
to
protect
informants
so
we
have
a
flow
of
information.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
i'd
say.
i
think
we
ought
to
do
everything
possible
to
protect
informants,
if
we
don't
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
the
system
is
going
to
breakdown.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
if
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
his
true
name
is
not
necessary
for
his
defense,
i
submit
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
it
would
be
cumulative
--
any
evidence
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that'll
hurt
a
little
bit
more
but
it's
cumulative,
really.
oh,
this
is
a
situation
where
we
have
to
balance
the
rights.
this
isn't
a
situation
where
the
state
is
merely
refusing
to
do
it,
to
try
to
convict
someone.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
we're
trying
to
protect
the
system.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
agree
with
you
that
its
--
that
if
perhaps
it
was
an
alias,
i
can
see
no
harm
in
it
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
i
agree.
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
a
situation
that
is
similarly
akin
to
this
is
a
situation
of
where
a
person
might
invoke
the
right
of
self-incrimination
in
a
trial.
and
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
consistently
held
that
where
a
witness,
a
governmental
witness,
invokes
self-incrimination,
and
his
testimony
which
is
--
which
he
invokes
the
privilege,
only
goes
to
credibility
that
the
error
created
is
only
harmless.
now
this
is
the
cardillo
case
in
a
--
spells
this
out,
has
been
followed
consistently
by
nearly
every
circuit
court.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
there's
a
little
distinction
there.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that
there's
a
corollary
between
the
two.
true,
the
governmental
privilege
is
not
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
but
it
is
not
a
mere
evidentiary
matter
and
a
procedural
matter.
i
think
that
the
governmental
privilege
is
something
that
shouldn't
yield
too
easily,
and
i
fully
agree
and
i
don't
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
there
are.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
even
though
he
claims
--
the
situation
is
not
the
same.
in
those
situations,
we
don't
have
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
distinction
is
here
is
that
you
and
i
and
the
other
200
million
people
in
this
country
collectively
have
a
privilege
to
protect
the
informant's
situation
unless
it
is
necessary
for
the
defense
of
this
individual
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
what
has
--
the
defendant
here
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no.
i
think
that
on
the
facts
in
this
individual
case,
we
are
really
asking
two
things.
one,
let's
not
have
a
blanket
rule.
let's
not
have
a
universal
principle
that
where
we
have
a
participating
informant
that
he
must
in
all
situations
divulge
his
name
and
his
present
address.
but
rather,
that
in
keeping
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
rovario,
each
case
should
fall
--
arise
on
its
own
merits.
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
court
said
this,
“we
believe
that
no
fixed
rule
with
respect
to
disclosure
is
justifiable”.
the
problem
is
when
it
calls
for
balancing
of
the
public
interest
and
protecting
the
flow
of
information
against
the
individual's
right
to
prepare
his
defense.
we
ask
two
things.
truthfully,
if
you
reverse
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
situation,
that
would
be
a
loss.
but
it
would
not
be
damaging.
what
we
want,
and
what
we
want
to
take
back
in
illinois
and
i
think
for
the
benefits
of
all
the
states
is
the
fact
that
where
no
--
we
don't
want
a
universal
rule
in
such
where
we
have
a
participating
informant,
there
must
just
be
complete
unfettered
cross-examination
even
where
it
will
not
be
beneficial
to
the
defendant.
in
this
situation,
what
could
they
have
learned
really?
they
could
affect
his
credibility.
and
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
and
anything
that
he
do,
it
just
pile
more
to
it.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
i'm
--
excuse
me
for
going
beyond
the
realm.
but
what
i'm
talking
about
is
that
we
are
--
if
--
i
believe
there
are
situations
where
the
name
and
the
present
address
really
aren't
going
to
be
that
helpful
to
the
defendant.
where
on
a
(inaudible),
if
we
can
protect
the
name
and
the
present
whereabouts
of
an
informant,
we
are
bolstering
the
whole
system
because
we
are
showing
these
people
that
we
are
going
to
do
everything
we
possibly
can
to
protect
them.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no.
oh,
i'm
not
asking
for
that.
i
think
that
would
be
unreasonable.
what
i'm
asking
for
is
that
we
get
--
that
don't
have
a
rule
which
says
that
he
must
in
each
case
regardless
of
the
circumstances
the
facts
what
is
brought
out
in
the
cross-examination
that
he
be
required
to
give
his
name
and
present
address.
he
might
not
make
it
until
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
--
oh,
perhaps
i
assumed
too
much
but
i
thought
this
court
was
well-aware
of
the
fact
that
what
does
happen
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
correct.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
agree
with
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
agree
with
your
point
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
all
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
let's
give
him
every
break
we
can.
at
least
let's
do
that.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
mean
try
to
hide
his
identity
and
his
present
whereabouts,
let's
do
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
he's
in
the
courtroom
now,
but
where
is
he's
going
to
be
at
5
o'clock
or
10
o'clock
tonight.
this
is
the
problem.
but
i
agree
with
you,
that
once
he
exposes
himself,
that's
a
--
he
has
subjected
to
--
through
this
retaliation
but
let's
give
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
don't
think
he
could
buy
an
insurance
policy
your
honor,
that's
for
sure.
but
i
do
believe
this,
that
there
are
informants
that
are
useful
two,
three,
four,
or
five
years,
some
of
them.
some
of
them
move.
some
of
them
voluntarily
assign
themselves
(inaudible)
if
they're
an
addict.
and
there
are
cases
of
informants
that
do
not
befall
this
horrible
fate
as
befall
so
many
of
them.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
he
should
divulge
in
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
know.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
know
that
your
honor.
fortunately,
it
was
brought
out.
i
mean,
the
court
was
aware
of
it.
it
was
brought
out
in
cross-examination.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no,
no.
i
know
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
maybe
the
prosecutor
thought
that
was
his
real
name.
this
is
a
funny
situation
but
if
you
have
a
witness
or
an
informant
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
he
has
to
prosecute
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
because
to
protect
the
identity
of
the
informant.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
he
probably
didn't
want
the
petitioner
to
know
who
this
man
really
was.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
know,
your
honor,
it's
--
i
mean,
here's
the
point,
if
were
the
prosecutor
and
the
witness
might
tell
me
his
name
is
james
jordan.
i
might
believe
him.
i
might
not
believe
it.
i
have
no
way
of
really
knowing
if
that
is
his
name
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
especially
an
addict.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
mr.
martwick
conducted
himself
as
a
proper
attorney
in
that
--
therefore
i
have
to
assume
at
least
that
the
--
he
didn't
know
that
james
jordan
was
not
his
actual
name.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
counsel
for
the
defense
knew
him.
counsel
for
defense
probably
knew
his
right
name
because
he
had
represented
him
before.
that's
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
it's
the
fact
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
the
situation
in
cook
county
is
such
is
that
--
in
the
state
attorney's
office
and
attorney
might
have
--
you
know,
one
trial
right
after
another.
he
dropped
one
file,
pick
up
the
next
and
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
but
it's
very
difficult
sometimes
to
adequately
talk
to
your
witnesses
prior
to
the
presentation
of
your
case.
the
case
load
is
so
tremendous
at
cook
county
that
this
is
a
real
problem
as
the
--
but
i
cannot
assume
that
bob
martwick
did
not
conduct
himself
in
a
proper
way.
and
i
truthfully,
i
mean,
having
been
(inaudible)
myself
for
a
while,
i
really
--
if
somebody
tells
you,
“my
name
is
john
jones”.
that's
john
jones.
i
don't
know
who
he
is.
i
mean,
i
can't
--
i'm
--
true,
as
if
you
put
a
witness
on
a
stand,
you're
vouching
for
his
credibility
but
how
do
you
really
know?
you
don't.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
it
affects
his
credibility.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
if
it's
going
to
help
him,
yes,
he
isn't.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
if
it
is
going
to
be
of
aid
to
the
defendant,
yes.
if
it
isn't
going
to
be
merely
to
add
more
weight
to
the
--
to
his
already
practically
destroyed
credibility,
then
let's
balance
that
against
the
rights
that
we
possess.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
so
your
honor,
but
i
think
there's
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
there's
only
one
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
source
of
narcotics.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
seller
on
the
street
is
normally
an
addict.
the
people
that
are
taking
the
profit
out
of
narcotics
never
go
down
on
the
street
and
actually
sell
the
$5-bag
went
up
to
$16,
these
people
aren't
and
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
the
syndicate
is
the
sole
--
real
supplier
of
narcotics.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
sure
there
are
a
few
independent
small
operators
that
might
run
some
in
from
mexico,
marijuana
or
something
but
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
this
man
was
selling
narcotics
because
he
was
supporting
a
habit
and
that's
exactly
why
he
was
selling
narcotics,
fleming
smith.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
right,
i
agree.
but
i
cannot
argue
against
the
fact
that
if
in
a
given
situation,
the
name
and
present
address
are
necessary
to
the
defendant.
i'd
say
that
the
state
should
be
required
to
reveal
his
identity.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
this
decision
has
to
be
made
at
the
trial
but
the
trial
have
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
think
the
state
would
always
take
the
position.
they
will
try
to
take
the
position
that
we
don't
have
to
reveal
it.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
don't
think
that
the
decision
lies
totally
within
the
defense
or
i
don't
think
it
lies
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
don't
think
it
lies
totally
with
the
defense
or
with
the
prosecution.
i
think
the
decision
has
to
be
made
at
trial
during
cross-examination
by
the
trial
judge
when
he
is
evaluating
the
facts
that
have
been
elicited
on
cross-examination.
and
then
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
make
the
ultimate
determination
on
whether
he
should
allow
the
governmental
privilege
to
be
invoked
or
whether
the
name
and
present
address
should
be
given
to
the
defendant
because
it'll
be
of
aid
to
him
in
his
defense.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
thank
you
very
much.
