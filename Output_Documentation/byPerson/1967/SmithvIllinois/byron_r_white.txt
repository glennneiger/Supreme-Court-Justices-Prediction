well,
why
do
you
want
to
--
what
interest
does
the
state
got
in
this?
justice
byron

white
but
wasn't
he
still
known
as
jordan?
justice

white
oh,
i
know
but
wasn't
he
known
as
jordan
up
and

justice

when
he
testified
(voice

--
justice
byron

white
in
other
cases
as
jordan,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
must
have
been
known
like
something
up
and
down
the
street?
he
was
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but,
what
name
was
he
known
by?
well,
once
you
surface
an
informant
and
he
starts
testifying,
it
seems
to
me
that
you've
--
the
interest
in
protecting
the
informer
at
least
diminishes.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
you
--
and
that's
usually
why
you
store
up
to
20
cases
before
you
put
them
on
the
stand.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
once
he
comes
out,
then
the
people
who
know
it
and
especially
if
he
testifies
under
a
name
that
he's
known
by
up
and
down
the
street,
that's
--
i
don't
know
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wonder
how
much
interest
the
states
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
you
think
the
witness
should
be
forced
whether
he's
an
informer
or
not
to
give
his
address?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
if
automatically
if
a
state's
witness
was
asked
his
address.
don't
you
think
that
the
defense
is
entitled
to
have
it
without
showing
that
this
is
--
without
showing
anything?
they
want
to
check
and
find
out
about
his
reputation
maybe
or
things
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
this
circumstance?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
say
that
--
what
you
could
really
say
is
that
this
fellow,
you
shouldn't
have
to
give
any
name
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
would
--
i
gather
that
you
would
say
that
when
a
state
puts
on
a
witness
and
that
they
don't
need
to
ask
him
his
name
and
if
he's
asked
his
name
on
a
cross-examination,
he
doesn't
need
to
give
any
at
all,
nor
his
address?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
is
that
enough
to
be
--
to
make
it
necessary
that
the
defense
would
like
to
know
who
he
is
so
that
they
could
check
on
his
criminal
record
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
his
right
name,
is
it
enough
that
they
could
check
on
his
reputation
in
the
neighborhood?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
enough
to
make
it
necessary
for
the
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
found
that,
you
might
find
out
that
--
you
might
find
out
that
he
had
a
lot
of
fights
with
this
defendant
and
was
out
to
get
him.
he
knew
who
he
was,
what
his
associations
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that's
quite
a
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
prove
that?
how
does
the
defendant
ever
prove
that
except
saying
i'd
like
to
know
something
about
this
fellow,
i
can
at
least
know
his
name
so
that
i
can
carry
on
a
meeting
for
cross-examination,
that
isn't
enough
of
a
showing?
what
would
he
ever
have
to
show?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose,
if
you
could
make
that
showing,
why,
your
answer
would
be,
“well,
you
don't
need
to
cross-examine
him
anyway”.
you
already
have
the
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if

justice
byron

white
what's
wrong
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nobody
has
unfettered
cross-examination
rights
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
want
a
rule
then
--
it
says
that
an
informant
never
has
to
give
his
name
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
the
states
--
why
shouldn't
--
it
should
be
on
the
other
foot,
if
the
states
are
going
to
serve
this
--
an
informant
and
put
him
on
the
bench,
so
why
shouldn't
the
state
have
to
come
up
and
give
some
pretty
solid
reason
if
it
wants
to
interfere
with
what

what
the
words
would
be
cross-examination,
“what's
your
name

why
shouldn't
the
