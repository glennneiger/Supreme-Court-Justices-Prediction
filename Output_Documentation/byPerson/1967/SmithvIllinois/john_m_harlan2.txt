yes,
the
counsel.
there
was
a
statement
that
counsel
did
know
but
there
was
never
a
finding
of
fact
that
he
knew
him
by
any
other
name
or
what
name
he
knew
him
by.
it
might
very
well
have
been
that
he
knew
him
by
james
jordan,
but
at
the
same
time
when
this
man
is
testifying,
he
does
state
that
this
is
not
his
right
name,
never
a
finding
of
fact
that
mr.
pride
who
represented
him
knew
who
this
man
was
by
his
correct
name,
never
finding
a
fact.
justice
john
m.

well,
mr.
pride
says
that
he
had
represented
jordan
at
one
time,
not
merely
knew
him,
but
he
had
represented
him
as
a
lawyer.

wouldn't
you
think
the
fact
that
counsel
asked
this,
a
rather
an
unusual
question
out
of
the
blue,
is
that
to
some
indication
that
he
knew
that
the
man
was
giving
a
name
different
from
the
one
that
he
--
the
lawyer
knew
was
--
he
had
as
his
client?
