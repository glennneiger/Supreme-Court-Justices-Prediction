wouldn't
your
argument

justice
byron

white
wouldn't
your
argument
really
--
shouldn't
it
really
reach
the
situation
where
the
teacher
publishes
information
which
is
true
in
terms
of
its
consequence
on
other
teachers
disrupting
the
school
if
it
does
--
or
in
terms
of
any
breach
of
loyalty.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
true
state
witness
is
as
vulnerable

is
it

is
as
vulnerable
as
the
false
one
in

loosing

what

why
couldn't

is
protected

justice

i
take
it
that
you
--
justice

would
say
that
there's
no
interest

that
there's
not
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
state
in
terms
of
maintaining
order
and
whatnot
or
whatever,
however
you
want
to
put
it.
there
is
not
sufficient
interest
in
the
state
in
controlling
the
speech
of
its
public
employees
--
justice
byron

white
--
to
allow
them
to
be
fired
when
they
make
a
truthful
statement
about
what
the
superintendent
is
doing
that
the
teachers
don't
like.
justice

of
course,
so
what
is
the
interest
of
the
--
what
is
the
interest
of
the

then
that
you
think
can
override
in
making
a

(voice

statement.
justice
byron

white
you
really
don't
distinguish
them
between
true
and
false
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
seem
to
me
you
would
be
making
an
argument
here
that
lies
just
shouldn't
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
that
the
false
statements
--
and
the
only
reason
you
would
ever
protect
a
false

is
for
the
reason
that
you'd
protect
a
--
in
times,
namely
the
--
in
order
to
protect
the
truth,
there's
not
a
sufficient
excuse
here
for
protecting
lies
like
there
was
in
new

times.
justice

well,
were
--
these
factual
situation
though
you
were
saying
--
arguing
apparently
that
some
of
the
statements
were
true
and
therefore
he
may
be
fired?
justice
byron

white
i
mean,
some
of
the
statements
were
false
and
therefore
he
may
be
fired,
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
but
i
would
take
it
you
would
say
that
he
could
also
be
fired
for
making
true
ones
if
they
were
sufficiently
disruptive?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
should
the
first
amendment
protect
false
statements,
just
plain
lies?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
certainly
the
functions
of
the
first
amendment,
i
would
suppose
--
justice

(voice

to
get
accurate
information
around,
so
people
can
make
it
a
reasonable

not

false

justice

thought
malice

was

whether

was
knowingly
false

recklessly
made.
justice

well,
that
maybe
so,

explain

why

to
resort
to
some
normal
sources
of
information
before
he
publishes
a
statement
that
is
false.
justice

that's
quite
a

they

you
don't
