justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
were
there
findings
made?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
like
judges.[laughter]
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
because
of
the
employer-employee
relationship,
isn't
that
right?
because
the
court
said
that
they
apply
it
because
of
the
employer-employee
relationship.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
does
it
makes
any
difference
--
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
in
terms
of
the
first
amendment
problem
that's
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
defending
that
standard?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what's
your
--
what
you're
presenting
to
us
is
a
proposition
that
--
if
mr.
pickering
was
reasonably
inaccurate,
then
his
dismissal
was
justified?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
he
had
made
this
not
in
the
form
a
written
communication,
let's
suppose
he
had
made
a
speech.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
just
a
speech
outside
to
more
than
10
people,
let's
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
do
you
get
that?
justice
abe
fortas
where
do
you
get
that,
a
little
higher
privilege?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
there
is
a
local
law
saying
that
there
is
some
kind
of
privilege
if
you
address
teachers
--
if
a
teacher
addresses
other
teachers?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
a
local
law,
you
don't
really
mean
that,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
then
i
suppose
--
suppose
he
made
a
speech
at
a
patent-teachers
association
meeting?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
was
wrong,
he
had
been
carefully
investigated
--
wrong.
justice
abe
fortas
even
though,
a
speech
at
a
parent-teachers
meeting?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
apply
that,
suppose
some
government
employee,
some
employee
of
the
state
made
criticisms
of
a
governor,
an
elected
governor
of
a
state
and
they
were
wrong
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
say
that
that's
ground
for
a
dismissal
constitutionally,
that
is
all
we're
talking
about?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
teacher,
i
just
want
you
to
address
yourself
to
the
specific
questions
if
you
will,
suppose
a
teacher
published
in
a
paper,
an
open
letter,
send
out
an
open
letter
to
the
public
in
illinois
in
which
he
criticized
the
governor
for
the
governor's
alleged
action
or
inaction
with
respect
to
the
public
school
system.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
you,
in
other
words,
you
think
that
this
depends
on
the
approximate.
this
is
a
privilege
that
relates
to
the
relationship
between
the
employee
and
his
immediate
employer.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
agree
with
that.
justice

fortas
