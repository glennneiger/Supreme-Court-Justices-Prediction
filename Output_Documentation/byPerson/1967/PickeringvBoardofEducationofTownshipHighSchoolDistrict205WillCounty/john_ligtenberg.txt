mr.
john
ligtenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
has
considerable
similarity
to
the
one
that
you
heard
yesterday
afternoon
from
alaska.
marvin
pickering
was
dismissed
by
the
board
of
education
of
lockport,
illinois
because
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
--
which
is
published
in
the
local
paper
in
which
he
criticized
the
board
of
education.
all
other
reasons
for
his
dismissal
are
excluded
in
this
case.
the
only
question
therefore
before
you
is
precisely
a
first
amendment
question.
the
public
high
school
board
of
lockport,
illinois
had
over
a
period
of
years
faced
the
usual
growing
problems
that
had
been
common
in
the
last
numbers
of
years
in
that
prior
of
the
country
and
elsewhere.
in
1962,
it
had
presented
a
bond
issue
to
the
purpose
of
erecting
a
public
high
school,
a
new
public
high
school.
that
bond
issue
lost.
same
--
later
that
same
year
with
some
revisions
and
plans
and
with
other
arguments
in
favor
of
the
new
school
building,
a
larger
bond
issue
for
five
and
half
million
dollars
was
presented
to
the
voters
and
that
bond
issue
passed.
the
situation
then
continued
or
until
about
1964
when
the
board
decided
that
it
needed
more
money
and
a
higher
tax
rate
to
run
the
school
--
the
high
schools
of
that
district
and
it
presented
a
tax
rate
referendum
to
the
board
of
education
--
to
the
people
of
that
community
some
time
in
the
spring.
that
tax
referendum
lost.
later
in
--
another
one
was
offered,
another
tax
rate
referendum
was
offered
in
september.
and
on
september
22nd
or
19th
rather,
that
referendum
was
voted
upon
and
it
lost.
marvin
pickering
was
a
teacher
in
that
high
school.
he
is
a
science
teacher.
he
had
been
attending
meetings
of
the
board
of
education
for
the
last
two
years
until
he
was
not
only
familiar
with
their
problems
but
also
knew
the
reasons
why
they
were
having
trouble
getting
their
message
across
to
the
public.
therefore,
he
wrote
a
letter
which
he
submitted
to
the
editor
of
the
lockport
herald
on
about
the
22nd
of
september
just
three
days
after
the
election.
and
that
letter
at
his
request
was
published
in
the
lockport
herald
on
--
in
the
issue
of
september
24.
on
october
8,
just
two
weeks
later,
the
board
of
education
voted
to
dismiss
him.
now,
i
perhaps
want
to
spend
a
little
time
going
into
some
of
the
allegations
of
that
letter
a
little
bit
later.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes
he
was
your
honor.
he
was
a
tenure
teacher
under
the
laws
of
illinois,
have
served
with
probationary
period
and
under
that
he
was
entitled
to
notice
and
a
hearing.
he
did
get
notice,
and
he
received
the
hearing
and
it
was
after
that
the
board
voted
to
dismiss
him.
that
was
subsequently
taken
to
the
circuit
court
of
that
county
under
the
provisions
of
the
illinois
administrative
review
act
and
thus
again
finally
thus
--
as
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
then
finally
here
of
course.
of
course
we
are
here
because
he
lost
at
each
of
those
three
stages.
the
charges
against
him
on
page
10
--
of
the
--
page
--
volume
1
of
the
appendix
and
while
i
don't
want
to
read
them
all,
i
just
want
to
advert
to
some
of
the
high
spots
in
these
charges.
that
--
it
starts
on
page
nine.
it
says
he
wrote
a
letter
which
--
and
that
in
this
letter
without
justification
he
questioned
and
impugned
the
motives,
honesty,
integrity,
truthfulness,
responsibility
and
competence
of
this
board
of
education
and
the
school
administrators.
and
then
continued
a
little
further,
he
says
he
is
seriously
involved
by
this
letter
and
damaged
the
professional
reputations
of
the
administrators
and
the
board
and
the
reputations
of
the
schools
of
this
district
and
are
and
will
be
highly
disruptive
to
the
discipline
of
the
teachers
and
the
moral
and
harmony
among
the
teachers,
administrators,
board
of
education
and
residents
of
this
district
and
that
these
comments
will
tend
to
ferment
controversy.
please
note
your
honors
that
nothing
is
said
here
about
its
disrupting
the
educational
process
in
the
school.
nothing
was
said
here
that
there
was
anything
in
this
charge
--
there's
nothing
in
these
charges
that
said
this
is
going
to
reach
down
and
harm
the
children
who
are
attending
this
school.
it
mentions
citizens,
administrators,
board
members,
and
that's
all.
now
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
no,
i'm
only
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
don't
think
it
actually
changes
it.
i
just
--
they
just
--
i
think
that
it's
important
in
that
one
sense
because
later
on
as
i
saw
the
case
at
that
time
and
i
tried
it
there,
if
they
had
been
able
to
prove
that
there
had
been
any
real
incitement
to
riot,
or
something
like
that
among
the
students
maybe
that
would
have
in
my
judgment
at
that
time
affected
it.
but
nothing
at
that
time
was
charged
and
i
might
add
some
of
the
questions
that
asked
now
that
not
one
word
of
evidence
was
ever
offered
to
the
affect
that
any
disruption
of
any
kind
ever
took
place
either
in
the
school
itself
or
among
the
faculty
or
among
the
board
members.
i
assume
the
board
members
got
disrupted
though
by
--
they
wouldn't
have
made
the
charges.
but
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
kind.
it
was
simply
assumed
that
the
speaking
or
writing
of
these
words
whether
the
thing
that
caused
the
damage
to
such
an
extent
that
he
had
to
be
fired.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
no,
they
said
they
were
damaged,
but
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
on
that
score.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
think
they
--
as
i
remember
the
order
it
was
said
there,
it
did
and
would
say
if
--
that
if
the
order
sort
of
recited
these
charges
that
i
just
said.
so
that's
the
extent
of
it
your
honor.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
the
board
is
an
elective
board.
there
are
seven
members
of
the
board.
they're
elected
every
--
some
are
elected
every
year.
so
it
runs
through
in
three
years.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes,
terms
of
three
years
and
--
but
they
run
alternately.
now,
in
my
view,
in
our
view
of
this
case
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes,
the
illinois
school
code
provides
that
when
charges
are
made
against
a
teacher,
those
charges
are
heard
by
the
employing
board.
the
board
that
heard
these
charges
is
precisely
the
board
against
whom
he
complained
in
his
letter
and
who
felt
that
they
were
damaged
by
his
letter.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
oh!
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes,
he
followed
the
statutory
course
which
is
to
demand
a
hearing
in
10
years
or
in
10
days.
the
hearing
was
demanded,
it
was
granted,
a
hearing
was
held.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
as
to
that
part,
there
is
no
question
of
the
conformity
to
the
procedural
rules
applied
to
this
case.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes
your
honor,
and
it's
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
there
--
it's
a
--
abstract
in
the
appendix
and
i
think
the
record
is
here
in
this
--under
the
administrative
review
act
of
illinois,
yes,
its
on
â€“
it
begins
on
page
37
your
honor
or
39.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
of
the
abstract
or
appendix
volume
1,
that's
where
it
begins.
the
board
at
this
hearing
presented
proof
of
publication
which
we
admitted.
they
attempt
--
they
prove
that
this
paper
had
some
2,900
subscribers.
i
--
the
position
that
i
didn't
care
for
millions
of
subscribers
it
was
the
same
principle
involved
as
far
as
i
was
concerned.
the
question
i
think
that
i
would
like
to
present
is
whether
there
is
any
limit
prima
facie
to
the
first
amendment
rights
of
public
employees.
in
our
brief,
we
have
taken
position
that
public
employees
demands
at
least
with
all
the
first
amendment,
the
freedom
of
speech
rights
that
any
other
person
has
by
taking
the
job
with
some
agency
of
the
government,
state,
federal
or
local.
that
person
does
not
thereby,
ipso
facto
lose
some
rights.
we
think
that
applies
to
school
teachers
and
i
think
you
will
immediately
see
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
raised
so
much
to
those
that
--
or
before
you
yesterday.
we
feel
that
the
--
if
we
take
the
analogy
of
the
loyalty
oath
cases
that
we
have
come
--
we
have
found
here
that
finally
you
apply
the
same
test
in
loyalty
oath
cases
of
public
employees
as
you
do
in
some
of
the
cases
such
as
for
instance
new
york
times.
in
new
york
times
there
was
a
question
of
truth.
you
laid
down
a
rule
which
i'm
certain
we
need
not
to
spend
much
time
talking
about.
we
think
that
within
that
rule
if
applied
here,
there
was
the
issue
of
certain
statements
and
this
letter
as
to
whether
they're
true
or
false.
the
board
claimed
that
most
of
them
were
false.
actually
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
well,
the
finding
of
the
board
of
education
was
that
they
were
all
--
all
their
charges
were
sustained.
in
the
--
and
then
the
specifications
which
were
added
later
in
the
circuit
court,
they
specified
some
i
think
16
items
in
the
letter
that
they
said
were
false.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
well,
they
held
the
charges
are
true
and
they
said
that
letters
in
this
--
the
statements
in
the
letter
are
false.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
that's
right,
they
have
isolated
i
think
some
16
statements
that
they
said
were
false.
now,
that
was
substantially
upheld
by
the
circuit
court
of
will
county.
it
was
substantially
upheld
also
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
no
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
hearing
de
novo.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
it
goes
up
on
the
record,
yes,
on
the
transcript
and
on
the
documents.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
no,
there
is
not
your
honor,
that
--
the
statute
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes
your
honor,
there
were
two
opinions
filed.
the
--
and
that
is
--
those
are
also
of
course
in
the
volume
one
of
the
appendix
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
they're
on
page
134,
the
first
one
is,
and
then
the
next
one
is
just
following.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
upheld
substantially
that
all
these
charges
in
their
opinion
had
been
substantially
proved
to
be
false.
that
is
the
charge
are
proved
to
be
true
and
the
statements
on
the
letter
had
been
proved
to
be
false
possibly,
with
one
exception.
the
dissenting
opinion
filed
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
took
the
opposite
suit
--
view.
there
were
five
justices
sitting
when
this
case
was
heard
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
there
were
two
vacancies
at
that
particular
time.
and
two
of
those
justices
dissented
and
found
that
there
--
in
their
opinion,
on
the
testimony
of
mr.
pickering
at
the
trial,
he
had
shown
that
he
had
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
all
the
statements
that
he
made.
so
that
again,
if
it's
question
of
truth
or
falsity
and
the
effect
falsity,
we
come
back
i
think
to
very
much
a
situation
like
there
was
in
the
new
york
times
case
where
he
had
--
for
instance
i'll
take
maybe
the
most
controversial
one.
he
said
that
the
board
spent
some
$200,000.00
a
year
on
athletics.
in
order
to
make
up
that
total
at
the
hearing
he
had
scrounge
and
he
had
found
some
$170,000.00
of
athletic
expenses
then
he
listed
at
the
hearing
maybe
a
half
a
dozen
or
more
areas
of
expenditures
that
he
hadn't
been
able
to
locate
yet
and
didn't
know
how
much
they
were.
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
board,
at
its
side
of
the
case
that
about
$111,000.00
of
that
was
capital
expenditure
and
perhaps
not
be
--
would
not
be
a
reoccurring
and
yet
he
came
as
we
thought
and
as
apparently
the
dissenting
justices
of
the
supreme
court
thought
close
enough
to
proving
his
round
figure.
there
were
other
similar
charges,
money
spent.
mr.
pickering
took
--
he
seems
to
follow
the
idea
that
he
knew
what
was
wrong.
he
knew
--
in
his
judgment
he
had
a
diagnosis
of
why
the
board
was
losing
these
bond
issues
and
tax
referendum,
particularly
the
tax
referendum.
incidentally
one
charge
they
made
that
he
in
his
letter
had
called
the
last
two
elections,
bond
issue
elections
whereas
there
was
tax
referendum
election
and
they
call
that
a
lie.
of
course
it
was
certainly
a
mistake,
but
it
was
certainly
not
one
that
bar
any
relation
to
--
what
in
the
alaska
case,
and
what's
called
morality.
these
are
the
types
of
things
that
they
struck
at.
he
--
i
think
his
letter
had
some
asperity
about
it.
there
was
a
sharpness
of
tone
about
it.
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
cases
that
we
have
had
here,
this
is
not
something
that
destroys
their
value,
the
right
of
writing
in
a
letter.
we
have
said
so
many
times
and
we
had
read
many
times
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
well,
i
have
read
i
think
both
in
that
regard.[attempt
to
laughter]
so
that
of
course
we
at
in
illinois
we
tend
to
read
the
both,
but
sometimes
we
rely
to
great
extent
on
the
majority
opinions.
i
confess
to
the
ills
of
most
attorneys
in
that
respect.
we
read
the
ones
we
like.
i
think
however
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
oh,
well
the
illinois
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
recited
at
considerable
length
the
evidence
about
the
truth
and
falsity
of
the
letter
and
it
said
in
a
couple
of
sentences
or
maybe
even
on
one
sentence,
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
garrison
versus
louisiana
don't
apply,
just
like
that.
i
don't
think
i
have
exaggerated
that
at
all
when
i
put
it
that
way.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes,
the
court
said
in
its
opinion
that
in
effect
at
least
that
when
you
enter
into
government
employ,
you
give
up
so
many
of
your
rights.
i
think
that
for
a
court
to
adhere
to
the
rule
that
if
you
work
for
ford
you
buy
fords.
if
you
wanted
to
take
that
attitude
that
was
about
the
way
it
said.
you
have
to
--
a
school
is
entitled
to
--
is
supposed
to
be
a
person
who
yields
up
a
lot
of
his
right.
he
has
to
walk
a
pretty
straight
line
according
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion.
the
court
said
that
this
phrase
which
as
it
appears
in
the
illinois
law,
the
--
that
among
other
things
that
the
board
may
dismiss
and
remove
a
teacher
when
the
best
interests
of
the
schools
require
it
is
a
phrase
under
which
the
--
as
it
has
been
said
in
a
number
of
illinois
cases,
the
best
interest
of
the
school
is
the
guiding
star
of
the
board
of
education.
now,
sometimes
the
opinions
or
most
of
the
time,
the
opinions
have
semantically
giving
us
some
value
to
that
by
showing
some
causes
that
could
be
said
to
get
warrant
to
the
use
of
that
phrase
in
that
case.
but
the
--
certainly
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
based
pretty
sharply
on
that
very
thing
that
the
guiding
star
of
the
board
of
the
--
board
of
education
is
the
best
interest
of
the
schools.
and
if
--
in
its
opinion
the
best
interest
of
the
schools
are
violated
by
something
a
teacher
has
done,
then
here
is
the
catch
all
phrase
like
you
had
in
alaska
or
not
an
alaska
case,
maybe
not
quite
a
as
the
terminology,
but
it's
the
same
idea.
it
catches
everything.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
education.
if
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
education,
the
best
interest
of
a
school
require
it,
then
the
teacher
may
be
dismissed.
so
that
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
no,
i'm
talking
--
i
said
board,
i
think
throughout
that
--
anyway,
i
mean
board,
the
board
of
education
under
the
statute
may
dismiss
a
teacher
when
in
its
opinion
the
best
interest
of
the
school
require
it.
i'm
paraphrasing
it
at
this
point.
so
that
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
the
statute
is
on
page
4,
actually
of
the
brief
and
it
says
what
the
scope
of
the
review
is
and
it
says
that
there's
no
additional
evidence
to
be
presented,
the
tenure
law
itself
in
providing
for
hearings
as
the
--
a
court
reporter
must
be
present,
that
a
transcript
must
be
made.
the
rule
always
says
that
--
also
says
that
the
court
will
review
the
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
it
was
substantial
evidence.
in
other
words,
the
way
the
substantial
evidence
rule
in
the
manifest
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
precisely,
i
think
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
pardon?
mr.
john
ligtenberg
oh,
yes.
well,
your
honor
i
have
been
counseling
teacher's
cases
for
many
years
and
i've
taught
that
for
a
number
years,
before
it
was
put
in
the
statute
and
save
me
any
further
litigation.
i
think
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments
for
--
to
reply.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
interesting
that
this
letter
was
written
after
the
election,
not
before.
i
don't
think
that
changes
anything,
but
it
does
apparently
have
something
to
do
with
the
--
after
the
board
or
this
teacher.
perhaps
the
letter
as
counsel
said,
was
in
some
respects
illogical,
but
please
note
that
counsel
cited
nothing
in
these
rules
by
which
pickering
might
have
been
warned
that
he
could
get
into
trouble
except
that
rather
a
deceptive
rule
that
letter
should
be
submitted
to
the
public
relations
director
to
avoid
embarrassment
and
other
things.
the
--
throughout
this
case
the
board
has
denied
that
that
was
supposed
to
be
any
kind
of
a
break
on
prepublication.
it
was
only
for
the
purpose
of
getting
accuracy.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
think
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
the
function
of
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
think
the
exact
points
as
stated
by
your
honor.
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
give
the
public
correct
information.
the
first
--
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
and
its
--
the
key
to
it
is
to
allow
open
public
debate
so
that
correct
information
may
be
arrived
at
by
the
public.
for
that
purpose
in
order
to
establish
--
to
permit
and
to
assure
a
debate
by
which
the
truth
may
be
arrived
at
even
false
statements
are
protected.
now
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes,
they
are,
knowingly
false
statements
unless
they
are
malicious
and
unless
they're
done
with
the
purpose
of
harming.
now,
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
if
malicious
--
unless
maliciously
made
as
i
understand
but
now
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
well,
as
a
matter
--
in
a
corporate
sense
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
well,
i
think
i
have
to
stand
corrected
on
that
because
that
is
true.
but
in
this
case,
i'm
carried
away
in
this
case
here
by
the
fact
that
nobody
said
that
these
are
knowingly
false
statements.
it
did
say
that
it
was
perhaps
recklessly
made,
but
they
had
nobody
ever
said
that
they
were
knowingly
false
and
counsel
didn't
say
so
here.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
think
that
if
we
cut
the
rule
in
that
frame
then
we
are
getting
into
the
question
of
constantly
having
to
prove
knowingly
and
that
itself
is
the
serious
break
on
open
public
debate.
that
was
the
--
my
answer
to
this
your
honor.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
the
--
that
i
think
in
the
first
place
sounds
very
reasonable.
in
the
second
place,
in
the
new
york
times
case,
the
new
york
times
at
least
corporately
had
all
the
facts
and
the
new
york
times
is
excused
in
the
basis
that
the
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
and
now
of
course
the
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
of
course
you
limit
it
to
your
question
as
i
understand
it
to
the
field
of
employment,
public
employment.
i
think
there
was
a
case
in
the,
the
len
case
i
think
in
which
it
was
said
that
a
debate
involving
statements
of
this
kind
--
in
private
employment
were
protected.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
that
was
a
statutory
test
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
but
i
don't
believe
that
we
could
in
the
first
amendment
situation
relegate
that
entire
matter
to
a
statute.
now,
at
the
same
time
we
do
not
need
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
this
charge
is
not
made.
no
court
found
that
the
statements
made
by
mr.
pickering
were
knowingly
false,
not
even
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
not
the
circuit
court
of
will
county.
none
of
those
courts
found
that
these
statements
are
knowingly
false.
i
think
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
except
that
--
yes,
in
the
first
instance
except
that
i
think
in
first
amendment
cases
the
court
will
tend
to
examine
the
record
for
itself
and
come
to
it's
own
conclusion
in
matters
of
these
kind,
with
that
exception
yes.
now,
if
this
kind
of
criticism
is
present
in
this
case
and
in
the
alaska
case,
is
ground
for
discharge
of
teachers
on
the
theory
of
--
that
they
should
first
exhaust
their
remedies
then
i
think
we're
in
trouble
here
because
the
public
will
only
get
one
side.
now,
the
counsel
kept
arguing
that
if
you
made
the
speech
under
different
context
or
in
different
circumstances
and
the
--
then
it
might
be
different
or
he
said
that
it's
so
hard
to
get
bond
issues
and
tax
referendum
passed
nowadays.
we
have
to
be
very
certain
about
these
things.
now,
it's
precisely
on
that
area
that
public
debate
is
necessary
in
these
situations.
the
test
here
is
the
deploy
information.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
again,
we
understand
here
with
the
fact
that
if
we
read
the
testimony
of
pickering
which
is
in
the
record
here
beginning
with
some
time
after
page
35
or
39
in
appendix
one,
we
certainly
must
say
that
he
made
an
excellent
presentation
to
show
that
he
had
reasonable
grounds
for
what
he
believed
and
what
he
had
written.
now,
this
--
another
thing
is
that
in
illinois,
there
is
no
statute,
rule
or
regulation
which
told
pickering
where
he
would
be
judged
by
any
other
standards
than
--
by
any
other
standards
than
other
citizens.
we
have
i
think
the
right
to
assume
that
in
all
cases,
free
speech
is
a
highly
protected
right
and
that
criticism
of
public
officials
in
their
conduct
by
statements
not
knowingly
false
is
protected.
free
speech
may
be
limited
only
by
standards
expressed
in
clear
and
precise
language.
now,
i
submit
your
honor
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
haven't
--
i'm
not
--
i
can't,
well
recite.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
think
they
would
have
some
relevance
and
i
would
say
of
course
i'm
--
in
my
conviction
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
--
that
they're
wrong,
i
read
them
quite
some
time
ago
and
i
would
say
that
my
conviction
is
around
the
rules
that
i
expressed
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
(voice
overlap)
the
applications
of
the
right
of
free
speech.
there's
a
--
in
cases
of
this
kind,
now
the
woman
who
has
going
around
slandering,
now
--
that
i
would
think
this
is
maybe
else
but
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
know
she
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
she
didn't
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
proof
there
was
--
or
there
was
any
basis
for
her
claims
or
not.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
this
would
be
--
and
i
would
argue
for
it
certainly
mr.
john
ligtenberg
if
this
phrase
just
as
your
honor
states
that
i
would
hold
--
i
would
claim
so,
yes.
i
would.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
would
say
so
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
our
statute
is
about
the
best
interest
of
the
schools
and
the
opinion
of
the
board
is
unconstitutionally
obeyed
because
it
doesn't
tell
us
or
is
give
us
any
standard
if
its
--
when
it's
applied
to
the
free
speech
area.
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
has
considerable
similarity
to
the
one
that
you
heard
yesterday
afternoon
from
alaska.
marvin
pickering
was
dismissed
by
the
board
of
education
of
lockport,
illinois
because
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
--
which
is
published
in
the
local
paper
in
which
he
criticized
the
board
of
education.
all
other
reasons
for
his
dismissal
are
excluded
in
this
case.
the
only
question
therefore
before
you
is
precisely
a
first
amendment
question.
the
public
high
school
board
of
lockport,
illinois
had
over
a
period
of
years
faced
the
usual
growing
problems
that
had
been
common
in
the
last
numbers
of
years
in
that
prior
of
the
country
and
elsewhere.
in
1962,
it
had
presented
a
bond
issue
to
the
purpose
of
erecting
a
public
high
school,
a
new
public
high
school.
that
bond
issue
lost.
same
--
later
that
same
year
with
some
revisions
and
plans
and
with
other
arguments
in
favor
of
the
new
school
building,
a
larger
bond
issue
for
five
and
half
million
dollars
was
presented
to
the
voters
and
that
bond
issue
passed.
the
situation
then
continued
or
until
about
1964
when
the
board
decided
that
it
needed
more
money
and
a
higher
tax
rate
to
run
the
school
--
the
high
schools
of
that
district
and
it
presented
a
tax
rate
referendum
to
the
board
of
education
--
to
the
people
of
that
community
some
time
in
the
spring.
that
tax
referendum
lost.
later
in
--
another
one
was
offered,
another
tax
rate
referendum
was
offered
in
september.
and
on
september
22nd
or
19th
rather,
that
referendum
was
voted
upon
and
it
lost.
marvin
pickering
was
a
teacher
in
that
high
school.
he
is
a
science
teacher.
he
had
been
attending
meetings
of
the
board
of
education
for
the
last
two
years
until
he
was
not
only
familiar
with
their
problems
but
also
knew
the
reasons
why
they
were
having
trouble
getting
their
message
across
to
the
public.
therefore,
he
wrote
a
letter
which
he
submitted
to
the
editor
of
the
lockport
herald
on
about
the
22nd
of
september
just
three
days
after
the
election.
and
that
letter
at
his
request
was
published
in
the
lockport
herald
on
--
in
the
issue
of
september
24.
on
october
8,
just
two
weeks
later,
the
board
of
education
voted
to
dismiss
him.
now,
i
perhaps
want
to
spend
a
little
time
going
into
some
of
the
allegations
of
that
letter
a
little
bit
later.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes
he
was
your
honor.
he
was
a
tenure
teacher
under
the
laws
of
illinois,
have
served
with
probationary
period
and
under
that
he
was
entitled
to
notice
and
a
hearing.
he
did
get
notice,
and
he
received
the
hearing
and
it
was
after
that
the
board
voted
to
dismiss
him.
that
was
subsequently
taken
to
the
circuit
court
of
that
county
under
the
provisions
of
the
illinois
administrative
review
act
and
thus
again
finally
thus
--
as
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
then
finally
here
of
course.
of
course
we
are
here
because
he
lost
at
each
of
those
three
stages.
the
charges
against
him
on
page
10
--
of
the
--
page
--
volume
1
of
the
appendix
and
while
i
don't
want
to
read
them
all,
i
just
want
to
advert
to
some
of
the
high
spots
in
these
charges.
that
--
it
starts
on
page
nine.
it
says
he
wrote
a
letter
which
--
and
that
in
this
letter
without
justification
he
questioned
and
impugned
the
motives,
honesty,
integrity,
truthfulness,
responsibility
and
competence
of
this
board
of
education
and
the
school
administrators.
and
then
continued
a
little
further,
he
says
he
is
seriously
involved
by
this
letter
and
damaged
the
professional
reputations
of
the
administrators
and
the
board
and
the
reputations
of
the
schools
of
this
district
and
are
and
will
be
highly
disruptive
to
the
discipline
of
the
teachers
and
the
moral
and
harmony
among
the
teachers,
administrators,
board
of
education
and
residents
of
this
district
and
that
these
comments
will
tend
to
ferment
controversy.
please
note
your
honors
that
nothing
is
said
here
about
its
disrupting
the
educational
process
in
the
school.
nothing
was
said
here
that
there
was
anything
in
this
charge
--
there's
nothing
in
these
charges
that
said
this
is
going
to
reach
down
and
harm
the
children
who
are
attending
this
school.
it
mentions
citizens,
administrators,
board
members,
and
that's
all.
now
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
no,
i'm
only
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
don't
think
it
actually
changes
it.
i
just
--
they
just
--
i
think
that
it's
important
in
that
one
sense
because
later
on
as
i
saw
the
case
at
that
time
and
i
tried
it
there,
if
they
had
been
able
to
prove
that
there
had
been
any
real
incitement
to
riot,
or
something
like
that
among
the
students
maybe
that
would
have
in
my
judgment
at
that
time
affected
it.
but
nothing
at
that
time
was
charged
and
i
might
add
some
of
the
questions
that
asked
now
that
not
one
word
of
evidence
was
ever
offered
to
the
affect
that
any
disruption
of
any
kind
ever
took
place
either
in
the
school
itself
or
among
the
faculty
or
among
the
board
members.
i
assume
the
board
members
got
disrupted
though
by
--
they
wouldn't
have
made
the
charges.
but
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
kind.
it
was
simply
assumed
that
the
speaking
or
writing
of
these
words
whether
the
thing
that
caused
the
damage
to
such
an
extent
that
he
had
to
be
fired.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
no,
they
said
they
were
damaged,
but
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
on
that
score.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
think
they
--
as
i
remember
the
order
it
was
said
there,
it
did
and
would
say
if
--
that
if
the
order
sort
of
recited
these
charges
that
i
just
said.
so
that's
the
extent
of
it
your
honor.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
the
board
is
an
elective
board.
there
are
seven
members
of
the
board.
they're
elected
every
--
some
are
elected
every
year.
so
it
runs
through
in
three
years.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes,
terms
of
three
years
and
--
but
they
run
alternately.
now,
in
my
view,
in
our
view
of
this
case
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes,
the
illinois
school
code
provides
that
when
charges
are
made
against
a
teacher,
those
charges
are
heard
by
the
employing
board.
the
board
that
heard
these
charges
is
precisely
the
board
against
whom
he
complained
in
his
letter
and
who
felt
that
they
were
damaged
by
his
letter.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
oh!
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes,
he
followed
the
statutory
course
which
is
to
demand
a
hearing
in
10
years
or
in
10
days.
the
hearing
was
demanded,
it
was
granted,
a
hearing
was
held.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
as
to
that
part,
there
is
no
question
of
the
conformity
to
the
procedural
rules
applied
to
this
case.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes
your
honor,
and
it's
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
there
--
it's
a
--
abstract
in
the
appendix
and
i
think
the
record
is
here
in
this
--under
the
administrative
review
act
of
illinois,
yes,
its
on
â€“
it
begins
on
page
37
your
honor
or
39.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
of
the
abstract
or
appendix
volume
1,
that's
where
it
begins.
the
board
at
this
hearing
presented
proof
of
publication
which
we
admitted.
they
attempt
--
they
prove
that
this
paper
had
some
2,900
subscribers.
i
--
the
position
that
i
didn't
care
for
millions
of
subscribers
it
was
the
same
principle
involved
as
far
as
i
was
concerned.
the
question
i
think
that
i
would
like
to
present
is
whether
there
is
any
limit
prima
facie
to
the
first
amendment
rights
of
public
employees.
in
our
brief,
we
have
taken
position
that
public
employees
demands
at
least
with
all
the
first
amendment,
the
freedom
of
speech
rights
that
any
other
person
has
by
taking
the
job
with
some
agency
of
the
government,
state,
federal
or
local.
that
person
does
not
thereby,
ipso
facto
lose
some
rights.
we
think
that
applies
to
school
teachers
and
i
think
you
will
immediately
see
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
raised
so
much
to
those
that
--
or
before
you
yesterday.
we
feel
that
the
--
if
we
take
the
analogy
of
the
loyalty
oath
cases
that
we
have
come
--
we
have
found
here
that
finally
you
apply
the
same
test
in
loyalty
oath
cases
of
public
employees
as
you
do
in
some
of
the
cases
such
as
for
instance
new
york
times.
in
new
york
times
there
was
a
question
of
truth.
you
laid
down
a
rule
which
i'm
certain
we
need
not
to
spend
much
time
talking
about.
we
think
that
within
that
rule
if
applied
here,
there
was
the
issue
of
certain
statements
and
this
letter
as
to
whether
they're
true
or
false.
the
board
claimed
that
most
of
them
were
false.
actually
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
well,
the
finding
of
the
board
of
education
was
that
they
were
all
--
all
their
charges
were
sustained.
in
the
--
and
then
the
specifications
which
were
added
later
in
the
circuit
court,
they
specified
some
i
think
16
items
in
the
letter
that
they
said
were
false.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
well,
they
held
the
charges
are
true
and
they
said
that
letters
in
this
--
the
statements
in
the
letter
are
false.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
that's
right,
they
have
isolated
i
think
some
16
statements
that
they
said
were
false.
now,
that
was
substantially
upheld
by
the
circuit
court
of
will
county.
it
was
substantially
upheld
also
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
no
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
hearing
de
novo.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
it
goes
up
on
the
record,
yes,
on
the
transcript
and
on
the
documents.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
no,
there
is
not
your
honor,
that
--
the
statute
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes
your
honor,
there
were
two
opinions
filed.
the
--
and
that
is
--
those
are
also
of
course
in
the
volume
one
of
the
appendix
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
they're
on
page
134,
the
first
one
is,
and
then
the
next
one
is
just
following.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
upheld
substantially
that
all
these
charges
in
their
opinion
had
been
substantially
proved
to
be
false.
that
is
the
charge
are
proved
to
be
true
and
the
statements
on
the
letter
had
been
proved
to
be
false
possibly,
with
one
exception.
the
dissenting
opinion
filed
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
took
the
opposite
suit
--
view.
there
were
five
justices
sitting
when
this
case
was
heard
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
there
were
two
vacancies
at
that
particular
time.
and
two
of
those
justices
dissented
and
found
that
there
--
in
their
opinion,
on
the
testimony
of
mr.
pickering
at
the
trial,
he
had
shown
that
he
had
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
all
the
statements
that
he
made.
so
that
again,
if
it's
question
of
truth
or
falsity
and
the
effect
falsity,
we
come
back
i
think
to
very
much
a
situation
like
there
was
in
the
new
york
times
case
where
he
had
--
for
instance
i'll
take
maybe
the
most
controversial
one.
he
said
that
the
board
spent
some
$200,000.00
a
year
on
athletics.
in
order
to
make
up
that
total
at
the
hearing
he
had
scrounge
and
he
had
found
some
$170,000.00
of
athletic
expenses
then
he
listed
at
the
hearing
maybe
a
half
a
dozen
or
more
areas
of
expenditures
that
he
hadn't
been
able
to
locate
yet
and
didn't
know
how
much
they
were.
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
board,
at
its
side
of
the
case
that
about
$111,000.00
of
that
was
capital
expenditure
and
perhaps
not
be
--
would
not
be
a
reoccurring
and
yet
he
came
as
we
thought
and
as
apparently
the
dissenting
justices
of
the
supreme
court
thought
close
enough
to
proving
his
round
figure.
there
were
other
similar
charges,
money
spent.
mr.
pickering
took
--
he
seems
to
follow
the
idea
that
he
knew
what
was
wrong.
he
knew
--
in
his
judgment
he
had
a
diagnosis
of
why
the
board
was
losing
these
bond
issues
and
tax
referendum,
particularly
the
tax
referendum.
incidentally
one
charge
they
made
that
he
in
his
letter
had
called
the
last
two
elections,
bond
issue
elections
whereas
there
was
tax
referendum
election
and
they
call
that
a
lie.
of
course
it
was
certainly
a
mistake,
but
it
was
certainly
not
one
that
bar
any
relation
to
--
what
in
the
alaska
case,
and
what's
called
morality.
these
are
the
types
of
things
that
they
struck
at.
he
--
i
think
his
letter
had
some
asperity
about
it.
there
was
a
sharpness
of
tone
about
it.
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
cases
that
we
have
had
here,
this
is
not
something
that
destroys
their
value,
the
right
of
writing
in
a
letter.
we
have
said
so
many
times
and
we
had
read
many
times
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
well,
i
have
read
i
think
both
in
that
regard.[attempt
to
laughter]
so
that
of
course
we
at
in
illinois
we
tend
to
read
the
both,
but
sometimes
we
rely
to
great
extent
on
the
majority
opinions.
i
confess
to
the
ills
of
most
attorneys
in
that
respect.
we
read
the
ones
we
like.
i
think
however
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
oh,
well
the
illinois
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
recited
at
considerable
length
the
evidence
about
the
truth
and
falsity
of
the
letter
and
it
said
in
a
couple
of
sentences
or
maybe
even
on
one
sentence,
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
garrison
versus
louisiana
don't
apply,
just
like
that.
i
don't
think
i
have
exaggerated
that
at
all
when
i
put
it
that
way.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes,
the
court
said
in
its
opinion
that
in
effect
at
least
that
when
you
enter
into
government
employ,
you
give
up
so
many
of
your
rights.
i
think
that
for
a
court
to
adhere
to
the
rule
that
if
you
work
for
ford
you
buy
fords.
if
you
wanted
to
take
that
attitude
that
was
about
the
way
it
said.
you
have
to
--
a
school
is
entitled
to
--
is
supposed
to
be
a
person
who
yields
up
a
lot
of
his
right.
he
has
to
walk
a
pretty
straight
line
according
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion.
the
court
said
that
this
phrase
which
as
it
appears
in
the
illinois
law,
the
--
that
among
other
things
that
the
board
may
dismiss
and
remove
a
teacher
when
the
best
interests
of
the
schools
require
it
is
a
phrase
under
which
the
--
as
it
has
been
said
in
a
number
of
illinois
cases,
the
best
interest
of
the
school
is
the
guiding
star
of
the
board
of
education.
now,
sometimes
the
opinions
or
most
of
the
time,
the
opinions
have
semantically
giving
us
some
value
to
that
by
showing
some
causes
that
could
be
said
to
get
warrant
to
the
use
of
that
phrase
in
that
case.
but
the
--
certainly
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
based
pretty
sharply
on
that
very
thing
that
the
guiding
star
of
the
board
of
the
--
board
of
education
is
the
best
interest
of
the
schools.
and
if
--
in
its
opinion
the
best
interest
of
the
schools
are
violated
by
something
a
teacher
has
done,
then
here
is
the
catch
all
phrase
like
you
had
in
alaska
or
not
an
alaska
case,
maybe
not
quite
a
as
the
terminology,
but
it's
the
same
idea.
it
catches
everything.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
education.
if
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
education,
the
best
interest
of
a
school
require
it,
then
the
teacher
may
be
dismissed.
so
that
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
no,
i'm
talking
--
i
said
board,
i
think
throughout
that
--
anyway,
i
mean
board,
the
board
of
education
under
the
statute
may
dismiss
a
teacher
when
in
its
opinion
the
best
interest
of
the
school
require
it.
i'm
paraphrasing
it
at
this
point.
so
that
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
the
statute
is
on
page
4,
actually
of
the
brief
and
it
says
what
the
scope
of
the
review
is
and
it
says
that
there's
no
additional
evidence
to
be
presented,
the
tenure
law
itself
in
providing
for
hearings
as
the
--
a
court
reporter
must
be
present,
that
a
transcript
must
be
made.
the
rule
always
says
that
--
also
says
that
the
court
will
review
the
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
it
was
substantial
evidence.
in
other
words,
the
way
the
substantial
evidence
rule
in
the
manifest
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
precisely,
i
think
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
pardon?
mr.
john
ligtenberg
oh,
yes.
well,
your
honor
i
have
been
counseling
teacher's
cases
for
many
years
and
i've
taught
that
for
a
number
years,
before
it
was
put
in
the
statute
and
save
me
any
further
litigation.
i
think
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments
for
--
to
reply.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
interesting
that
this
letter
was
written
after
the
election,
not
before.
i
don't
think
that
changes
anything,
but
it
does
apparently
have
something
to
do
with
the
--
after
the
board
or
this
teacher.
perhaps
the
letter
as
counsel
said,
was
in
some
respects
illogical,
but
please
note
that
counsel
cited
nothing
in
these
rules
by
which
pickering
might
have
been
warned
that
he
could
get
into
trouble
except
that
rather
a
deceptive
rule
that
letter
should
be
submitted
to
the
public
relations
director
to
avoid
embarrassment
and
other
things.
the
--
throughout
this
case
the
board
has
denied
that
that
was
supposed
to
be
any
kind
of
a
break
on
prepublication.
it
was
only
for
the
purpose
of
getting
accuracy.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
think
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
the
function
of
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
think
the
exact
points
as
stated
by
your
honor.
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
give
the
public
correct
information.
the
first
--
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
and
its
--
the
key
to
it
is
to
allow
open
public
debate
so
that
correct
information
may
be
arrived
at
by
the
public.
for
that
purpose
in
order
to
establish
--
to
permit
and
to
assure
a
debate
by
which
the
truth
may
be
arrived
at
even
false
statements
are
protected.
now
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
yes,
they
are,
knowingly
false
statements
unless
they
are
malicious
and
unless
they're
done
with
the
purpose
of
harming.
now,
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
if
malicious
--
unless
maliciously
made
as
i
understand
but
now
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
well,
as
a
matter
--
in
a
corporate
sense
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
well,
i
think
i
have
to
stand
corrected
on
that
because
that
is
true.
but
in
this
case,
i'm
carried
away
in
this
case
here
by
the
fact
that
nobody
said
that
these
are
knowingly
false
statements.
it
did
say
that
it
was
perhaps
recklessly
made,
but
they
had
nobody
ever
said
that
they
were
knowingly
false
and
counsel
didn't
say
so
here.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
think
that
if
we
cut
the
rule
in
that
frame
then
we
are
getting
into
the
question
of
constantly
having
to
prove
knowingly
and
that
itself
is
the
serious
break
on
open
public
debate.
that
was
the
--
my
answer
to
this
your
honor.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
the
--
that
i
think
in
the
first
place
sounds
very
reasonable.
in
the
second
place,
in
the
new
york
times
case,
the
new
york
times
at
least
corporately
had
all
the
facts
and
the
new
york
times
is
excused
in
the
basis
that
the
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
and
now
of
course
the
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
of
course
you
limit
it
to
your
question
as
i
understand
it
to
the
field
of
employment,
public
employment.
i
think
there
was
a
case
in
the,
the
len
case
i
think
in
which
it
was
said
that
a
debate
involving
statements
of
this
kind
--
in
private
employment
were
protected.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
that
was
a
statutory
test
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
but
i
don't
believe
that
we
could
in
the
first
amendment
situation
relegate
that
entire
matter
to
a
statute.
now,
at
the
same
time
we
do
not
need
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
this
charge
is
not
made.
no
court
found
that
the
statements
made
by
mr.
pickering
were
knowingly
false,
not
even
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
not
the
circuit
court
of
will
county.
none
of
those
courts
found
that
these
statements
are
knowingly
false.
i
think
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
except
that
--
yes,
in
the
first
instance
except
that
i
think
in
first
amendment
cases
the
court
will
tend
to
examine
the
record
for
itself
and
come
to
it's
own
conclusion
in
matters
of
these
kind,
with
that
exception
yes.
now,
if
this
kind
of
criticism
is
present
in
this
case
and
in
the
alaska
case,
is
ground
for
discharge
of
teachers
on
the
theory
of
--
that
they
should
first
exhaust
their
remedies
then
i
think
we're
in
trouble
here
because
the
public
will
only
get
one
side.
now,
the
counsel
kept
arguing
that
if
you
made
the
speech
under
different
context
or
in
different
circumstances
and
the
--
then
it
might
be
different
or
he
said
that
it's
so
hard
to
get
bond
issues
and
tax
referendum
passed
nowadays.
we
have
to
be
very
certain
about
these
things.
now,
it's
precisely
on
that
area
that
public
debate
is
necessary
in
these
situations.
the
test
here
is
the
deploy
information.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
again,
we
understand
here
with
the
fact
that
if
we
read
the
testimony
of
pickering
which
is
in
the
record
here
beginning
with
some
time
after
page
35
or
39
in
appendix
one,
we
certainly
must
say
that
he
made
an
excellent
presentation
to
show
that
he
had
reasonable
grounds
for
what
he
believed
and
what
he
had
written.
now,
this
--
another
thing
is
that
in
illinois,
there
is
no
statute,
rule
or
regulation
which
told
pickering
where
he
would
be
judged
by
any
other
standards
than
--
by
any
other
standards
than
other
citizens.
we
have
i
think
the
right
to
assume
that
in
all
cases,
free
speech
is
a
highly
protected
right
and
that
criticism
of
public
officials
in
their
conduct
by
statements
not
knowingly
false
is
protected.
free
speech
may
be
limited
only
by
standards
expressed
in
clear
and
precise
language.
now,
i
submit
your
honor
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
haven't
--
i'm
not
--
i
can't,
well
recite.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
think
they
would
have
some
relevance
and
i
would
say
of
course
i'm
--
in
my
conviction
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
--
that
they're
wrong,
i
read
them
quite
some
time
ago
and
i
would
say
that
my
conviction
is
around
the
rules
that
i
expressed
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
(voice
overlap)
the
applications
of
the
right
of
free
speech.
there's
a
--
in
cases
of
this
kind,
now
the
woman
who
has
going
around
slandering,
now
--
that
i
would
think
this
is
maybe
else
but
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
know
she
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
ligtenberg
she
didn't
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
proof
there
was
--
or
there
was
any
basis
for
her
claims
or
not.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
this
would
be
--
and
i
would
argue
for
it
certainly
mr.
john
ligtenberg
if
this
phrase
just
as
your
honor
states
that
i
would
hold
--
i
would
claim
so,
yes.
i
would.
mr.
john
ligtenberg
i
would
say
so
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
our
statute
is
about
the
best
interest
of
the
schools
and
the
opinion
of
the
board
is
unconstitutionally
obeyed
because
it
doesn't
tell
us
or
is
give
us
any
standard
if
its
--
when
it's
applied
to
the
free
speech
area.
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
--
