mr.
john
f.
cirricione
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
after
the
two
tax
rate
referendums
failed,
mr.
pickering
came
up
with
a
rather
comprehensive
indictment
not
only
of
the
school
board
but
also
that
the
superintendent.
some
of
the
teachers
who
were
assisting
in
attempting
to
get
the
message
to
the
community
by
writing
letters
to
the
same
paper
and
in
this
indictment
they
also
attacked
the
school's
athletic
program
and
--
per
se
not
just
the
handling
of
it
by
the
board,
but
the
whole
idea
of
having
athletics
within
the
program.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
not
of
the
athletic
program,
but
in
support
of
the
tax
rate
increase.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
no.
no,
his
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
right.
the
indictment
that
mr.
pickering
was
making
of
the
board
is
that
they
were
not
able
to
get
the
message
to
the
tax
payers
clearly
enough
to
pass
the
tax
rate
issues.
that
in
prior
dealings
with
the
public
they
didn't
get
the
message
as
to
the
building
bond
programs
so
that
when
they
came
to
this
issues,
the
public
had
gathered
distrust
and
then
in
formulating
his
premises
to
support
his
argument
that
the
board
no
longer
had
the
trust
of
the
public.
he
used
rather
illogical
approaches.
now
he
categorized
the
initial
failure
of
the
building
program
as
a
breach
of
promise
by
the
board
of
education
because
in
the
initial
program,
the
board
represented
that
there
would
be
no
frills.
the
frills
that
he
had
referenced
to
were
a
football
field,
athletic
field,
auditorium
and
swimming
pools.
now
the
initial
program
that
the
board
had
proposed
to
the
public
was
a
tutor
school,
a
two-year
school
plan.
when
the
voters
voted
this
down,
the
entire
plan
was
scrapped
and
a
new
program
developed
six
or
eight
months
later
that
was
presented
to
the
voters.
this
program
provided
for
a
4-year
school
on
side
of
the
--
the
district
is
divided
by
waterways,
chicago
sanitary
and
ship
canal.
and
the
board
proposed
to
construct
this
west
side
high
school
as
a
four-year
school
because
a
considerable
amount
of
the
population
was
located
west
of
this
waterway.
a
second
school
was
proposed
under
this
bond
issue
to
be
located
on
the
east
side
of
the
river,
but
this
was
to
be
a
two-year
school
so
in
constructing
the
west
side
school,
the
board
did
put
in
its
plans
and
it
was
publicized
that
an
auditorium
and
an
athletic
field
would
be
built
but
no
swimming
pool.
now
mr.
pickering
took
all
of
this
maze
of
activity
spreading
over
the
two-year
period
writing
his
letters
and
says
that
the
board
was
guilty
of
a
breach
of
promise
to
the
taxpayer.
going
on
and
using
language
that
would
tend
to
ridicule
and
make
sarcasm
of
the
board,
he
says,
“the
children
should
have
these
things,”but
promises
are
promises
your
honor.
whose
fault
is
this?
now,
this
is
the
tenor
of
the
letter,
it
goes
on
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
in
what
regard
your
honor?
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
well,
if
you're
going
to
apply
the
sun
time
--
new
york
times
rule,
i
suppose
that
the
board
would
have
to
show
that
the
falsehoods
were
made
in
bad
faith.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
took
the
position
that
we're
not
going
to
apply
the
new
york
times
rule.
we're
going
to
apply
a
standard
that
is
a
little
less
broad,
i
guess
you
might
say
and
restrict
the
teachers
to
a
standard
that
if
they're
called
upon
to
justify
their
statements,
they
must
have
a
reasonable
basis
in
fact
and
in
reporting
these
facts,
they
must
be
reasonably
accurate.
the
word
reasonably
appears
throughout
the
illinois
opinion.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
believe
this
is
the
only
standard
(voice
overlap)
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
oh!
yes.
i
think
the
effect
on
the
public
is
the
same.
if
it's
a
negligent
mistake
or
a
honest
mistake
or
even
a
bad
faith
mistake,
the
misrepresentations
to
the
public
has
the
same
effect.
it
would
further
defeat
our
proposals
to
pass
these
tax
rate
increases.
now,
i
might
say
here
that
all
of
us
here
today
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
before
whom
your
honor?
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
that
--
are
teachers?
because
i
think
a
speech
to
the
teachers
may
have
a
little
higher
privilege
than
making
a
speech
to
the
general
public.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
think
there's
some
of
that
effect,
the
local
law.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
that
--
the
area
of
the
debate
in
the
freedom
of
speech
is
broader,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
wish
i
could
give
you
the
citation
your
honor.
this
is
not
really
involved
in
the
case,
but
i
believe
this
to
be
the
law
and
i
think
it's
fair.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
then
i
think
i
would
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
would
think
that
the
standard
established
by
the
illinois
court
is
the
applicable
standard.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes.
i'll
tell
you
why
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
employer
has
to
be
put
into
a
position
where
they're
going
to
have
to
hire
people,
public
relations
people,
incur
expense
to
correct
the
mistakes
of
a
college
trained,
experienced
teacher,
it
shouldn't
have
to
be.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
well
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
again,
you
have
to
know
the
nature
of
the
relationship
of
employee
and
employer.
i
think
the
higher
in
the
--
hierarchy
of
government,
the
more
loyalty
is
owed
to
the
interest
of
the
employer.
the
president
of
the
united
states
undoubtedly
can
remove
any
member
of
his
cabinet,
even
if
there
were
a
tenure
statute.
if
he
felt
that
the
loyalties
of
this
member
were
detrimental
to
his
interest.
this
is
the
common
law
of
the
employer-employee
relationship.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
a
teacher
criticizing
the
governor?
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
think
he
has
a
privilege
that
is
equal
to
the
general
pubic
to
do
that.
the
governor
does
not
hire
the
teacher.
the
board
of
education
of
district
205
does
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes,
yes
and
i
think
the
federal
civil
service
system
adopts
this
position.
and
in
--
as
in
--
as
recent
as
1965,
this
court
has
denied
certiorari
in
the
cambridge
case
and
in
1962
the
houston
case.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
--
that's
the
way
i
interpret
it.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes,
i
think
the
publication
reaches
far
more
people
within
the
district.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
think
under
the
illinois
standard
he
probably
would
lose
his
job
and
a
--
even
better
your
honor
if
the
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
you
say,
before
teachers
or
parents?
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
thought
you
said
before
parents,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
alright.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
no.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
number
one,
i
think
in
debate
many
things
are
said
hastily
without
research.
but
if
preparing
a
written
document
to
be
submitted
to
a
newspaper
for
publication,
the
author
of
that
letter
has
ample
time
to
research
his
facts
and
determine
the
correctness
of
those
facts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case
the
school
board
had
a
policy
which
requested
the
teachers,
it
wasn't
a
mandatory
direction,
which
required
her,
not
required
but
directed
the
teachers
to
submit
their
publications
that
were
to
be
placed
in
a
newspaper
to
the
building
coordinator
prior
to
publication
for
the
purposes
of
accuracy.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
don't
believe
the
wording
is
mandatory
your
honor
i
think
it's
more
of
a
direction.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
it
says
that
before
releasing
a
publication,
a
teacher
should
submit
in
triplicate
the
proposed
publication
to
the
building
coordinator
of
the
school
district
for
the
purposes
of
accuracy.
that's
the
substance
of
it.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
that
the
word
is
should
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
not
a
basis
for
discharge.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
no,
no,
we're
not
contending
that.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
mean,
it
just
--
it
--
i
think
it
indicates
the
importance
in
an
--
in
a
passing
a
bond
issue
or
a
tax
referendum
of
getting
the
facts
clearly
before
the
public.
we
have
great
difficulty
passing
these
bond
issues.
i
believe
the
illinois
system
in
requiring
us
to
do,
this
is
so
archaic
that
maybe
that's
the
statute
that
ought
to
be
attacked
here
today
instead
of
the
dismissal
statute.
you're
asking
people
in
--
today
to
vote
themselves
to
raise
in
taxes.
this
is
most
difficult
and
it's
important
in
getting
the
message
to
the
public
that
the
facts
and
details
that
you
are
setting
out
to
them
is
accurate.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
--
not
per
se
your
honor.
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
one,
that
he
is
a
college
trained
man.
number
two,
that
he
has
been
with
the
district
for
five
years,
number
three
that
he
attended
most
of
the
meetings
for
the
two
years
last
--
passed
before
writing
his
letter,
that
the
books
and
records
of
the
school
district
are
available.
then
for
him
to
sit
down
and
write
the
letter
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
written,
just
cannot
be
justified.
i
just
feel
there's
no
excuse
for
writing
this
sort
of
a
letter
and
expect
to
escape
the
consequences
under
this
--
the
new
york
times
rule
because
of
the
employer-employee
relationship.
the
illinois
court,
majority
felt
this
way
even
justice
shafer
in
his
dissent
had
some
severe
criticism
of
the
judgment,
lack
of
good
judgment,
poor
taste
in
which
the
letter
was
written,
but
he
felt
that
the
new
york
times
rule
should
be
applied.
he
also
felt
that
because
of
the
vagueness
of
the
standard
of
best
interest
of
schools
that
at
least
in
reference
to
first
amendment
rights,
the
dismissal
statute
should
be
more
specific.
now
he
cited
no
cases.
actually
the
point
wasn't
--
it
was
not
raised
in
the
complaint
for
administrative
review,
it
was
argued
in
the
brief
and
argument
in
the
illinois
court
and
of
course
it's
reasserted
here
before
this
court.
we
feel
that
while
it's
coached
in
broad
language
the
relationship
between
teacher
and
the
board
and
the
various
members
of
the
public
could
lead
to
so
many
different
factual
situations
that
of
a
necessity,
it
must
be
coached
in
broad
language.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
the
congress
recognizes
this
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
well,
except
that
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
because,
i
think
the
courts
would
hold
that
a
truthful
statement
is
justified.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes.
not
--
i
would
say
justified.
if
he
makes
a
charge,
there's
a
basis
in
fact,
a
reasonable
basis
in
fact
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
--
to
support
the
charge.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
we
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
truth
plus
justification
your
honor.
i
--
sometimes
you
could
make
a
truthful
statement
that
could
be
more
damaging
than
telling
it,
not
lie.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
the
operation
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
--
of
inefficient
school
system
to
provide
our
high
school
students
with
an
adequate
quality,
secondary
education.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
just
think
that
the
courts
would
not
sustain
a
dismissal
of
a
teacher
where
the
statements
are
truthful
and
are
justified
in
fact
or
have
a
reasonable
justification
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
can
look
at
this
in
the
abstract.
i
think
we
have
to
confine
it
to
particular
factual
situations.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
some
of
the
statements
were
found
to
be
true
by
justice
shafer?
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
--
right
now
i
can't
visualize
a
situation
where
that
might
occur
but
this
could
be
very
true.
the
cramridge
(ph)
case
where
the
public
employee,
federal
public
employee
wrote
letters
to
fellow
employees,
wife
stating
that
the
husband
or
her
husband
was
having
an
affair
in
the
office.
civil
service
commission
said
we
don't
care
what
the
truth
or
false
would
be
in
that
letter
is.
we
wanted
to
know
how
this
is
going
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
the
federal
service
and
they
wouldn't
let
her
show
the
truth
or
falsity
of
that
letter.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
no,
no
your
honor
it
was
made.
the
vagueness
of
the
illinois
statute
was
not
raised
in
the
complaint
for
administrative
review
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
--
it's
made
even
now,
and
it's
argued
now.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes
sir,
all
the
way.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
that's
a
good
question
your
honor.
i
hesitate
to
speculate
on
it.
i
--
they
may
take
action
on
it,
but
i
doubt
if
the
courts
would
ever
sustain
it.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
the
teacher
might
be
dismissed
and
the
courts
might
sustain
it
and
in
--
at
least
in
illinois.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
approximately
35
miles
southwest
of
the
city
of
chicago
your
honor.
so
a
highly
rapidly
growing
area,
we
have
many,
many
problems.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
it's
near
the
city
of
joliet
which
is
the
home
of
stateville
penitentiary.
i
think
that's
our
greatest
claim
of
the
fame
there.
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
covered
every
point
i
wanted
to
raise
by
your
questions.
if
there's
anything
else,
i
would
just
sit
down.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
after
the
two
tax
rate
referendums
failed,
mr.
pickering
came
up
with
a
rather
comprehensive
indictment
not
only
of
the
school
board
but
also
that
the
superintendent.
some
of
the
teachers
who
were
assisting
in
attempting
to
get
the
message
to
the
community
by
writing
letters
to
the
same
paper
and
in
this
indictment
they
also
attacked
the
school's
athletic
program
and
--
per
se
not
just
the
handling
of
it
by
the
board,
but
the
whole
idea
of
having
athletics
within
the
program.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
not
of
the
athletic
program,
but
in
support
of
the
tax
rate
increase.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
no.
no,
his
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
right.
the
indictment
that
mr.
pickering
was
making
of
the
board
is
that
they
were
not
able
to
get
the
message
to
the
tax
payers
clearly
enough
to
pass
the
tax
rate
issues.
that
in
prior
dealings
with
the
public
they
didn't
get
the
message
as
to
the
building
bond
programs
so
that
when
they
came
to
this
issues,
the
public
had
gathered
distrust
and
then
in
formulating
his
premises
to
support
his
argument
that
the
board
no
longer
had
the
trust
of
the
public.
he
used
rather
illogical
approaches.
now
he
categorized
the
initial
failure
of
the
building
program
as
a
breach
of
promise
by
the
board
of
education
because
in
the
initial
program,
the
board
represented
that
there
would
be
no
frills.
the
frills
that
he
had
referenced
to
were
a
football
field,
athletic
field,
auditorium
and
swimming
pools.
now
the
initial
program
that
the
board
had
proposed
to
the
public
was
a
tutor
school,
a
two-year
school
plan.
when
the
voters
voted
this
down,
the
entire
plan
was
scrapped
and
a
new
program
developed
six
or
eight
months
later
that
was
presented
to
the
voters.
this
program
provided
for
a
4-year
school
on
side
of
the
--
the
district
is
divided
by
waterways,
chicago
sanitary
and
ship
canal.
and
the
board
proposed
to
construct
this
west
side
high
school
as
a
four-year
school
because
a
considerable
amount
of
the
population
was
located
west
of
this
waterway.
a
second
school
was
proposed
under
this
bond
issue
to
be
located
on
the
east
side
of
the
river,
but
this
was
to
be
a
two-year
school
so
in
constructing
the
west
side
school,
the
board
did
put
in
its
plans
and
it
was
publicized
that
an
auditorium
and
an
athletic
field
would
be
built
but
no
swimming
pool.
now
mr.
pickering
took
all
of
this
maze
of
activity
spreading
over
the
two-year
period
writing
his
letters
and
says
that
the
board
was
guilty
of
a
breach
of
promise
to
the
taxpayer.
going
on
and
using
language
that
would
tend
to
ridicule
and
make
sarcasm
of
the
board,
he
says,
“the
children
should
have
these
things,”but
promises
are
promises
your
honor.
whose
fault
is
this?
now,
this
is
the
tenor
of
the
letter,
it
goes
on
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
in
what
regard
your
honor?
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
well,
if
you're
going
to
apply
the
sun
time
--
new
york
times
rule,
i
suppose
that
the
board
would
have
to
show
that
the
falsehoods
were
made
in
bad
faith.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
took
the
position
that
we're
not
going
to
apply
the
new
york
times
rule.
we're
going
to
apply
a
standard
that
is
a
little
less
broad,
i
guess
you
might
say
and
restrict
the
teachers
to
a
standard
that
if
they're
called
upon
to
justify
their
statements,
they
must
have
a
reasonable
basis
in
fact
and
in
reporting
these
facts,
they
must
be
reasonably
accurate.
the
word
reasonably
appears
throughout
the
illinois
opinion.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
believe
this
is
the
only
standard
(voice
overlap)
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
oh!
yes.
i
think
the
effect
on
the
public
is
the
same.
if
it's
a
negligent
mistake
or
a
honest
mistake
or
even
a
bad
faith
mistake,
the
misrepresentations
to
the
public
has
the
same
effect.
it
would
further
defeat
our
proposals
to
pass
these
tax
rate
increases.
now,
i
might
say
here
that
all
of
us
here
today
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
before
whom
your
honor?
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
that
--
are
teachers?
because
i
think
a
speech
to
the
teachers
may
have
a
little
higher
privilege
than
making
a
speech
to
the
general
public.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
think
there's
some
of
that
effect,
the
local
law.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
that
--
the
area
of
the
debate
in
the
freedom
of
speech
is
broader,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
wish
i
could
give
you
the
citation
your
honor.
this
is
not
really
involved
in
the
case,
but
i
believe
this
to
be
the
law
and
i
think
it's
fair.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
then
i
think
i
would
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
would
think
that
the
standard
established
by
the
illinois
court
is
the
applicable
standard.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes.
i'll
tell
you
why
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
employer
has
to
be
put
into
a
position
where
they're
going
to
have
to
hire
people,
public
relations
people,
incur
expense
to
correct
the
mistakes
of
a
college
trained,
experienced
teacher,
it
shouldn't
have
to
be.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
well
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
again,
you
have
to
know
the
nature
of
the
relationship
of
employee
and
employer.
i
think
the
higher
in
the
--
hierarchy
of
government,
the
more
loyalty
is
owed
to
the
interest
of
the
employer.
the
president
of
the
united
states
undoubtedly
can
remove
any
member
of
his
cabinet,
even
if
there
were
a
tenure
statute.
if
he
felt
that
the
loyalties
of
this
member
were
detrimental
to
his
interest.
this
is
the
common
law
of
the
employer-employee
relationship.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
a
teacher
criticizing
the
governor?
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
think
he
has
a
privilege
that
is
equal
to
the
general
pubic
to
do
that.
the
governor
does
not
hire
the
teacher.
the
board
of
education
of
district
205
does
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes,
yes
and
i
think
the
federal
civil
service
system
adopts
this
position.
and
in
--
as
in
--
as
recent
as
1965,
this
court
has
denied
certiorari
in
the
cambridge
case
and
in
1962
the
houston
case.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
--
that's
the
way
i
interpret
it.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes,
i
think
the
publication
reaches
far
more
people
within
the
district.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
think
under
the
illinois
standard
he
probably
would
lose
his
job
and
a
--
even
better
your
honor
if
the
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
you
say,
before
teachers
or
parents?
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
thought
you
said
before
parents,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
alright.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
no.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
number
one,
i
think
in
debate
many
things
are
said
hastily
without
research.
but
if
preparing
a
written
document
to
be
submitted
to
a
newspaper
for
publication,
the
author
of
that
letter
has
ample
time
to
research
his
facts
and
determine
the
correctness
of
those
facts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case
the
school
board
had
a
policy
which
requested
the
teachers,
it
wasn't
a
mandatory
direction,
which
required
her,
not
required
but
directed
the
teachers
to
submit
their
publications
that
were
to
be
placed
in
a
newspaper
to
the
building
coordinator
prior
to
publication
for
the
purposes
of
accuracy.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
don't
believe
the
wording
is
mandatory
your
honor
i
think
it's
more
of
a
direction.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
it
says
that
before
releasing
a
publication,
a
teacher
should
submit
in
triplicate
the
proposed
publication
to
the
building
coordinator
of
the
school
district
for
the
purposes
of
accuracy.
that's
the
substance
of
it.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
that
the
word
is
should
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
not
a
basis
for
discharge.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
no,
no,
we're
not
contending
that.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
mean,
it
just
--
it
--
i
think
it
indicates
the
importance
in
an
--
in
a
passing
a
bond
issue
or
a
tax
referendum
of
getting
the
facts
clearly
before
the
public.
we
have
great
difficulty
passing
these
bond
issues.
i
believe
the
illinois
system
in
requiring
us
to
do,
this
is
so
archaic
that
maybe
that's
the
statute
that
ought
to
be
attacked
here
today
instead
of
the
dismissal
statute.
you're
asking
people
in
--
today
to
vote
themselves
to
raise
in
taxes.
this
is
most
difficult
and
it's
important
in
getting
the
message
to
the
public
that
the
facts
and
details
that
you
are
setting
out
to
them
is
accurate.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
--
not
per
se
your
honor.
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
one,
that
he
is
a
college
trained
man.
number
two,
that
he
has
been
with
the
district
for
five
years,
number
three
that
he
attended
most
of
the
meetings
for
the
two
years
last
--
passed
before
writing
his
letter,
that
the
books
and
records
of
the
school
district
are
available.
then
for
him
to
sit
down
and
write
the
letter
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
written,
just
cannot
be
justified.
i
just
feel
there's
no
excuse
for
writing
this
sort
of
a
letter
and
expect
to
escape
the
consequences
under
this
--
the
new
york
times
rule
because
of
the
employer-employee
relationship.
the
illinois
court,
majority
felt
this
way
even
justice
shafer
in
his
dissent
had
some
severe
criticism
of
the
judgment,
lack
of
good
judgment,
poor
taste
in
which
the
letter
was
written,
but
he
felt
that
the
new
york
times
rule
should
be
applied.
he
also
felt
that
because
of
the
vagueness
of
the
standard
of
best
interest
of
schools
that
at
least
in
reference
to
first
amendment
rights,
the
dismissal
statute
should
be
more
specific.
now
he
cited
no
cases.
actually
the
point
wasn't
--
it
was
not
raised
in
the
complaint
for
administrative
review,
it
was
argued
in
the
brief
and
argument
in
the
illinois
court
and
of
course
it's
reasserted
here
before
this
court.
we
feel
that
while
it's
coached
in
broad
language
the
relationship
between
teacher
and
the
board
and
the
various
members
of
the
public
could
lead
to
so
many
different
factual
situations
that
of
a
necessity,
it
must
be
coached
in
broad
language.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
the
congress
recognizes
this
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
well,
except
that
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
because,
i
think
the
courts
would
hold
that
a
truthful
statement
is
justified.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes.
not
--
i
would
say
justified.
if
he
makes
a
charge,
there's
a
basis
in
fact,
a
reasonable
basis
in
fact
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
--
to
support
the
charge.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
we
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
truth
plus
justification
your
honor.
i
--
sometimes
you
could
make
a
truthful
statement
that
could
be
more
damaging
than
telling
it,
not
lie.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
the
operation
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
--
of
inefficient
school
system
to
provide
our
high
school
students
with
an
adequate
quality,
secondary
education.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
just
think
that
the
courts
would
not
sustain
a
dismissal
of
a
teacher
where
the
statements
are
truthful
and
are
justified
in
fact
or
have
a
reasonable
justification
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
can
look
at
this
in
the
abstract.
i
think
we
have
to
confine
it
to
particular
factual
situations.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
some
of
the
statements
were
found
to
be
true
by
justice
shafer?
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
i
--
right
now
i
can't
visualize
a
situation
where
that
might
occur
but
this
could
be
very
true.
the
cramridge
(ph)
case
where
the
public
employee,
federal
public
employee
wrote
letters
to
fellow
employees,
wife
stating
that
the
husband
or
her
husband
was
having
an
affair
in
the
office.
civil
service
commission
said
we
don't
care
what
the
truth
or
false
would
be
in
that
letter
is.
we
wanted
to
know
how
this
is
going
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
the
federal
service
and
they
wouldn't
let
her
show
the
truth
or
falsity
of
that
letter.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
no,
no
your
honor
it
was
made.
the
vagueness
of
the
illinois
statute
was
not
raised
in
the
complaint
for
administrative
review
--
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
--
it's
made
even
now,
and
it's
argued
now.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes
sir,
all
the
way.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
that's
a
good
question
your
honor.
i
hesitate
to
speculate
on
it.
i
--
they
may
take
action
on
it,
but
i
doubt
if
the
courts
would
ever
sustain
it.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
the
teacher
might
be
dismissed
and
the
courts
might
sustain
it
and
in
--
at
least
in
illinois.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
yes.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
approximately
35
miles
southwest
of
the
city
of
chicago
your
honor.
so
a
highly
rapidly
growing
area,
we
have
many,
many
problems.
mr.
john
f.
cirricione
it's
near
the
city
of
joliet
which
is
the
home
of
stateville
penitentiary.
i
think
that's
our
greatest
claim
of
the
fame
there.
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
covered
every
point
i
wanted
to
raise
by
your
questions.
if
there's
anything
else,
i
would
just
sit
down.
