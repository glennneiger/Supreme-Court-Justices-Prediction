mr.
richard
m.
roberts
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
several
results
that
this
court
could
reach
in
this
case.
the
government
submits
and
agrees
verily
that
this
is
not
a
proper
cost
of
administration
entitled
to
a
class
1
priority.
the
purpose
of
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
is
to
rehabilitate
a
distressed
organization.
it
allows
as
cost
of
administration
those
expenses
that
are
necessary
to
rehabilitate
the
corporate
--
either
a
corporation
or
an
individual.
chapter
xi
proceedings
are
separate
and
distinct
from
chapter
x
reorganizations.
for
instance,
in
chapter
x,
section
64
priorities
do
not
apply.
also
by
statute
in
chapter
x
reorganizations,
congress
has
made
the
equity
receivership
rules
applicable.
it
says
the
court
shall
sit
and
have
the
powers
of
a
receiver
in
equity.
and
that
i
think
is
why
you
find
that
in
some
aspects
in
bankruptcy,
they
refer
to
the
receivership
cases.
in
fact,
the
case
cited
by
collier
for
his
proposition
that
negligence
are
allowable
as
priority
claims
in
cost
of
administration
is
a
railroad
receivership
case.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
a
chapter
x
case
in
this
--
i
really
do
not
know,
mr.
justice
white
what
would
happen
in
a
chapter
x
reorganization
proceeding.
there
are
several.
there
is
no
tri-parties
schedule.
in
the
equity
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
--
railroad
receiverships,
however,
mr.
justice
white,
they
rank
the
priorities
and
there's
cost
to
administration.
if
you
read
the
railroad
cases
that
had
been
cited,
they
refer
their
bond
holders
who
are
contending
that
they
come
ahead
of
certain
classes
of
creditors.
in
those
cases
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
railroad
reorganization
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
they're
not
referred
to,
however,
your
honor,
as
cost
of
administration.
if
you
read
the
cases,
they
list
their
cost
of
administration
and
then
they
come
down
and
generally
surround
the
fourth
or
fifth
class;
that
they
refer
to
tort
claims
are
allowed
ahead
of
bond
holders
of
the
corporation.
they
do
not
refer
to
them
specifically
as
cost
of
administration
is.
i
read
those
cases.
they
rank
them
much
in
the
same
way
as
section
64
and
chapter
xi
rank
certain
classes
of
creditors.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
chapter
x,
yes
then
he
cites
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
and
i
think
--
as
we
point
out,
we
believe
that
some
tort
claims
could
be
allowable
in
this
type
of
proceeding
where
they
are
necessary,
where
they
are
covered
--
could
be
covered
by
a
liability
insurance,
for
instance
in
a
cab
operation.
surely
the
city
or
municipality
where
the
cab
company
is
operating
requires
liability
insurance.
i
do
not
believe
that
a
trustee
could
ignore
that
requirement
and
i
don't
think
the
insurance
company
could
defend
on
the
ground
for
the
trustee
is
not
liable
for
torts.
i
think
that
the
trustee's
insurance
would
cover
in
those
instances.
and
i
believe
that
in
this
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
would
think
the
performance
bond
could
be
looked
to.
in
fact,
there
is
one
company
here
who
is
suing
the
trustee
and
i
assume
they
are
looking
to
his
performance
bond
as
one
of
the
means
of
recovering.
i
think
also
that
they
would
look
to
the
bankrupt.
now,
in
this
instance,
absent
--
the
negligence
claims,
as
i
total
the
claims,
an
absence
--
tremendous
administrative
expenses,
which
are
not
as
yet
--
have
not
as
yet
been
allowed.
there
will
be
a
sum
remaining
in
this
bankruptcy.
if
you
total
the
creditors,
they
are
less
in
total
amount
than
their
limits
as
we
understand
that
it
will
be
recovered
under
the
fire
insurance
so
that
there
would
be
an
amount
that
would
go
back
to
the
bankrupt
if
he
were
discharged;
if
there
were
no
other
claim.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
as
i
understand,
it's
just
the
proceeds
to
the
insurance.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
now,
we
believe
that
this
court
in
nicholas
has
lead
away
to
the
--
a
way
that
the
court
claimant
here
could
have
recovered
or
could
have
at
least
presented
his
claim
if
he
had
met
the
requirements
of
63,
section
63
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
and
that
is
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no,
it
doesn't
deal
with
that
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
do
violence
to
the
bankruptcy
act
to
interpret
that
there
are
the
three
separate
periods,
which
is
the
periods,
free
bankruptcy,
there
is
the
chapter
xi
arrangement
period
and
then
there's
this
great
bankruptcy
period.
and
if
you
do
that,
then
a
tort
claim
would
--
during
the
chapter
xi
reorganization
would
come
in
as
a
general
creditor.
and
we
feel
that
that
is
the
equitable
result
to
reach
in
this
type
of
situation
that
there
he
shares
with
the
other
general
creditors.
it
is
merely
happen
--
instance
that
one
tort
claimant
would
be
three-bankruptcy
and
another
one,
chapter
xi
reorg
--
arrangement
proceeding,
tort
claimant.
in
fact,
in
many
cases,
mr.
justice
white
point
out
it
is
a
debtor
in
possession
who
is
operating
the
business
and
it's
the
same
person
operating
the
business
who
is
--
who
operated
three
chapter
xi
arrangements.
and
we
feel
that
in
no
circumstances
where
there
is
a
chapter
xi
that
it
would
no
violence
to
the
statute.
to
read
63
as
being
applicable
and
that
the
bankrupt
includes
the
period
pre
straight
bankruptcy.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
they
didn't
sue
in
time
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
preclude
them
completely,
your
honor.
it
might
rank
them
below
the
other
general
creditors
who've
had
then
diligent
and
who
have
sued.
well,
i
submit
that
it's
no
different
than
a
tort
claimant
who
might
have
had
the
same
thing
happen
three
days
prearrangement
in
any
circumstances.
there
are
some
creditors
who
are
not
going
to
get
paid
and
will
not
get
paid
in
full.
that
is
the
purpose
of
an
arrangement,
so
that
a
distressed
business
when
it
is
technically
insolvent
can
arrange
its
affair
so
that
it
may
survive
in
the
business
world.
and
it's
the
intent
of
congress
that
that
type
of
business
should
survive.
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
chapter
xi
arrangement
proceeding
that
they
have
a
way
of
arranging
their
businesses.
a
creditors
get
together
--
you
know,
i'm
sure
and
arrange
what
they
would
take
on
their
claims.
now,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
a
recovery.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cases
in
bankruptcy
involving
a
landlord
which
are
discussed
in
the
connor
case
in
this
court
cited
in
our
brief,
where
the
landlord
had
no
recovery
whatsoever,
this
is
the
instance
--
for
instance
where
the
premises
are
leased
to
a
business
for
a
long
period
of
time,
that
business
goes
bankrupt.
the
trustee
can
reject
the
lease
and
that's
an
action
of
the
trustee
in
rejecting
a
lease
not
the
bankrupt.
now,
prior
to
an
amendment
to
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
landlord
had
to
look
as
this
court
said
to
the
empty
shell,
the
corporation
for
any
recovery,
there
was
no
recovery
whatsoever.
congress
then
allowed,
taking
that
that
was
an
equitable
to
allow
him
no
recovery,
then
amended
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
to
allow
a
three-month
period
of
rent
to
the
landlord.
this
court
upheld
that
section
and
said
there
was
no
constitutional
restriction
of
that
type
on
the
lease;
that
the
landlord
was
not
entitled
to
damages
for
the
full
term
of
the
lease
and
we
submit
that
there's
no
problem
here
in
this
respect.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
believe
that
it
would
have
been
settled
as
other
claims
of
the
bankrupt
are
settled,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
in
a
--
rather
--
other,
oh
it
is
a
bankrupt
in
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
--
in
the
arrangement
proceeding.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
my
answer
to
that
is
no,
it's
not
an
expense
of
administration,
your
honor.
it
would
be
looked
on
under
our
view
in
this
way,
he
could
sue
the
trustee
and
then
if
the
business
then
goes
into
straight
bankruptcy,
he
would
be
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
understand
that.
but
if
he
does,
he
would
come
under
63
but
by
not
--
either
him
not
putting
it
on
the
straight
bankruptcy
or
other
creditors
not
putting
the
bankrupt
into
straight
bankruptcy.
our
position
is
that
he
would
then
share,
he
would
be
one
of
the
creditors
who
will
be
dealt
with
in
the
arrangement
proceedings.
now,
whether
he
accepts
the
proceedings
or
not,
as
i
read
the
arrangement,
chapter
xi
arrangement,
the
court
may
approve
a
proceeding
if
a
majority
of
the
creditors
approve
it.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
and
there's
--
the
trustee
has
been
discharged
there.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
why
i
think
of
the
plan
--
if
everything
has
worked
out,
as
i
understand
chapter
xi
proceedings,
if
everything
is
worked
out,
business
is
turned
back
to
the
debtor
and
he
operates
normally,
it's
not
by
trustee.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
if
the
remedy
is
there,
whether
it's
recoverable
or
not
will
depend
on
the
amount
of
money
available.
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
as
the
rests
of
the
debts,
yes.
it
would
then
be
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
correct.
we
say
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
i
think
its
provable
if
--
and
then
if
he
depends
whether
if
its
provable
in
a
straight
bankruptcy
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
they
had
started
their
suit
as
63
requires
prior
to
the
straight
bankruptcy
being
filed.
i
don't
believe
that
a
trustee
can
operate
a
business
and
not
have
claims
against
him
provable.
i
don't
believe
that
act
should
be
read
that
way.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it's
provable
in
bankruptcy
but
you
have
to
meet
certain
conditions
to
be
provable
in
bankruptcy
and
they
have
to
meet
those
conditions.
if
they
meet
those
conditions,
we
submit
under
our
argument
that
they
would
be
provable.
and
we
feel
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
this
case,
my
theory
is
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
if
as
to
which
remedy
is
sue
the
trustee
and
then
when
there
is
an
overages,
there
will
be
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it
will
share
in
that.
now,
counsel
for
the
bank,
for
the
claimant
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
there'll
be
--
there's
a
sum
of
money
available.
if
i
read
that
the
claims
have
been
totaled
correctly,
and
i
believe
that
they
have.
and
i
do
not
believe
the
cost
of
administration
although
there
are
litigation
expenses
i
have
no
idea
what
the
court
is
going
to
allow
as
a
cost
of
administration.
but
assume
that
the
cost
of
administration
is
not
great
enough
to
eat
up
what's
left,
there
will
be
something
here
for
these
claimants.
now,
yesterday
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
sure
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
the
reason
it
would
be
--
it
would
survive
bankruptcy
where
it's
not
proved.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
any
claim
that's
not
provable
is
not
discharged.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
this
--
well,
this
court
has
passed
on
this
question
on
several
railroad
cases
where
the
bankrupt
--
after
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
after
the
trustee,
and
equity
receivership
there.
it
would've
--
property
was
given
back
to
the
owner
and
the
claims
against
the
trustee
for
them
allowable
against
the
property
although
it
was
the
negligence
of
the
trustee.
they're
texas
and
pacific
railway
company,
the
johnson
at
151
u.s.,
81,
and
another
texas
in
pacific
railway
versus
bloom
at
164
u.s.
636.
now,
i
believe
that
in
that
instance
and
in
the
instance
that
was
resided
yesterday
where
goldmine
is
found
and
there's
$10,000,000
in
that
goldmine,
i
can't
believe
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
allow
the
claim
to
be
presented
against
the
bankrupt.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
personal
liability,
i
think
that
would
depend
on
the
negligence,
your
honor,
and
that
has
not
been
litigated
here
as
to
what
the
negligence
were.
the
allegations
of
negligence,
i
doubt
very
seriously,
that
they
would
warrant
a
personal
liability
of
the
trustee.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
he
said
the
bond,
if
i
understood,
he
said
that
the
bond
would
be
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
your
honor,
i
did
not
understand
his
argument
to
be
that
the
receiver
here
would
be
personally
liable
for
these
acts.
i
don't'
think
you
would
have
a
receiver
to
qualify
under
those
circumstances.
i
think
people
would
shy
away
for
the
receivership.
if
that's
the
outcome
of
this
case,
that
it's
--
he
is
to
be
personally
liable,
just
like
i
think
that
if
these
are
allowed
as
administration
expenses,
many
attorneys
are
going
to
hesitate
to
tell
other
claimants
or
other
would
be
claimants
then
suppliers
and
whatnot
to
do
business
in
a
chapter
xi
arrangement,
which
is
really
the
purpose
of
administration
expenses
or
allowing
them
as
administration
expenses
as
to
encourage
them
to
do
business
with
the
bankrupt
or
the
distressed
business.
and
if
anyone
who
is
a
lawyer
in
private
practice
was
approached
by
a
supplier,
was
advised,
“should
i
extend
credit
to
the
trustee?”
he's
going
to
have
to
consider
then
what
are
the
possible
limits
of
the
damage
claim
if
there
may
be
and
he'd
have
to
consider
the
type
of
business
and
anything
else
because
here,
the
people
who
would
extend
their
credit
and
who
have
attempted
to
assist
in
rehabilitating
the
bankrupt
are
going
to
have
to
share
pro
rata
if
these
are
administration
expenses.
and
they
would
be
penalized.
and
i
think
that
this
third
circuit
of
the
lower
court
here
were
correct
in
denying
these
claims
as
priority
claims.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
although
i
believe
that
if
he
had
presented
his
claim
as
a
creditor
in
the
arrangement
proceeding,
that
he
would
be
bound
by
that
proceeding.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
he's
just
a
creditor.
it
would
not
then
--
i
--
you've
correctly
summarized
our
position.
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
just
tell
a
moment
to
reply
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
thank
you
sir.
actually,
justice
fortas,
we
did
present
our
claim
during
the
arrangement
proceeding.
it
was
not
until
after
these
claims
were
presented.
not
--
it
was
not
until
may,
this
fire
occurred
in
january;
that
the
company
went
into
bankruptcy
and
we
considered
that
by
presenting
this
claim,
we
were
doing
the
equivalent,
starting
a
suit.
now,
i
would
like
to
lie
to
rest
the
contention
that
we
have
a
right,
first
of
all,
against
the
bankrupt.
i
do
not
sincerely
believe
we
could
possibly
have
a
claim
because
for
six
weeks,
he
had
been
out
of
control.
he
had
no
control
whatever
over
what
was
done
in
that
building.
this
was
an
engineer
who
was
hired
by
the
receiver
and
i
do
not
see
how
we
could
hold
the
bankrupt
responsible.
now,
our
claim
was,
as
i
say
presented
before
the
bankruptcy
occurred.
it
has
been
expunged
both
as
a
general
claim
and
as
an
administrative
expense
and
we
have
--
we
are
now
out
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
unless
the
judgment
is
reversed.
we
just
simply
had
no
standing
whatever.
now,
as
far
as
63
(a)
(7)
is
concerned,
that
appears
at
page
24
of
our
brief,
this
is
the
brief
for
petition
and
it
says,
“debts
of
the
bankrupt
may
be
proved
and
allowed
against
this
estate
which
are
founded
upon
the
following
things.”
now,
if
i
am
correct
and
i
don't
see
how
i
can
be
wrong
about
the
--
whether
this
is
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt,
if
i
am
correct,
then
certainly,
we
have
no
claim
under
the
section
63
because
this
covers
only
“debts
of
the
bankrupt”.
now
the
only
other
place
we
have
to
go
is
cost
and
expenses
of
administration.
there
is
no
other
place.
for
claims
against
the
receiver
which
arise
during
the
course
of
the
arrangement
or
during
the
course
of
bankruptcy,
and
well
i
must
confess
that
this
action
was
started
by
my
brother,
i
didn't
start
this
myself,
and
when
i
first
heard
that
he
had
started
a
claim,
this
was
expenses
of
administration,
i
had
the
same
reaction
that
some
of
your
honors
have
had
to
it
that
a
$3,500,000
doesn't
sound
like
an
expense
of
administration.
but
the
more
i
have
lived
with
this
thing,
i
can't
ask
your
honors,
to
spend
the
amount
of
time
thinking
about
that
i
have.
but
i
am
so
sure
that
this
can't
be
anything
else.
there's
no
other
place
to
go.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well
your
honor,
that
is
the
law
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
i
think
that
that
is
their
contention,
sir,
yes
but
this
is
--
this
has
been
the
law
of
some
states.
it
was
for
example,
the
law
of
new
york
when
vass
against
conron
brothers
was
decided.
but
it
is
not
as
i
understand
the
federal
law.
this
court
as
--
long
ago
as
i
think
141
u.s.
held
that
a
receiver
cannot
be
personally
liable.
it
was
a
rather
old
fashion
than
rather
a
devious
method.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
we
have
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
we
have
cited
a
case
at
the
end
of
our
--
i
think
it's
in
our
reply
brief,
which
holds
that
the
fact
that
you
got
a
judgment
in
a
separate
action
--
law,
establishes
only
the
amount
of
the
damages
but
also
that
you
have
a
claim
against
the
tortfeasor
but
unless
--
or
if
--
or
some
other
type
of
claim.
but
unless
the
claim
which
gave
rise
to
the
judgment
is
itself
provable,
the
judgment
is
not
provable
by
just
automatically.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
--
we
take
the
position
that
we
have
done
the
equivalent
of
suing
by
presenting
this
claim
for
-
--
we
of
course,
we
have
turned
to
the
administrative
expenses
but
it
was
expunged
not
only
for
that
but
under
63
(a)
(7).
now,
the
government
originally
said,
“well,
that's
quite
right”
and
then
now
they
say,
“well,
we
could
have
sued
under
63
(a)
(7)”
and
as
i
hope
i
have
demonstrated
to
your
honors,
i
just
don't
believe
that
we
have
any
such
thing.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
and
as
we
brought
suit,
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
as
long
--
i
have
always
questioned
whether
63
(a)
(7)
would
stand
up
if
somebody
really
wanted
to
give
it
to
give
it
back.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
yes
sir.
it
says
that.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
my
position
exactly,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
exactly
our
positions
here
that
we
--
that
these
people
--
we,
and
everybody
that
--
because
we
represent
now,
this
whole
$3,500,000
in
claims.
if
this
case
falls,
nobody
gets
a
nickel.
this
is
our
position
out
of
this
estate.
there
may
be
--
there's
some
insurance
proceeds.
this
is
the
first
time
i've
heard
that
there
was
policy,
which
i
think
we
would
be
entitled
to.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
the
question,
of
course
--
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
the
insurance
covers
the
trustee.
i
guess
it
does.
but
at
least
--
we
will
sue
the
receiver
on
the
grounds
not
that
he
personally
did
anything
but
that
his
agent
was
negligent.
that
is
our
theory
against
the
receiver.
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
several
results
that
this
court
could
reach
in
this
case.
the
government
submits
and
agrees
verily
that
this
is
not
a
proper
cost
of
administration
entitled
to
a
class
1
priority.
the
purpose
of
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
is
to
rehabilitate
a
distressed
organization.
it
allows
as
cost
of
administration
those
expenses
that
are
necessary
to
rehabilitate
the
corporate
--
either
a
corporation
or
an
individual.
chapter
xi
proceedings
are
separate
and
distinct
from
chapter
x
reorganizations.
for
instance,
in
chapter
x,
section
64
priorities
do
not
apply.
also
by
statute
in
chapter
x
reorganizations,
congress
has
made
the
equity
receivership
rules
applicable.
it
says
the
court
shall
sit
and
have
the
powers
of
a
receiver
in
equity.
and
that
i
think
is
why
you
find
that
in
some
aspects
in
bankruptcy,
they
refer
to
the
receivership
cases.
in
fact,
the
case
cited
by
collier
for
his
proposition
that
negligence
are
allowable
as
priority
claims
in
cost
of
administration
is
a
railroad
receivership
case.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
a
chapter
x
case
in
this
--
i
really
do
not
know,
mr.
justice
white
what
would
happen
in
a
chapter
x
reorganization
proceeding.
there
are
several.
there
is
no
tri-parties
schedule.
in
the
equity
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
--
railroad
receiverships,
however,
mr.
justice
white,
they
rank
the
priorities
and
there's
cost
to
administration.
if
you
read
the
railroad
cases
that
had
been
cited,
they
refer
their
bond
holders
who
are
contending
that
they
come
ahead
of
certain
classes
of
creditors.
in
those
cases
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
railroad
reorganization
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
they're
not
referred
to,
however,
your
honor,
as
cost
of
administration.
if
you
read
the
cases,
they
list
their
cost
of
administration
and
then
they
come
down
and
generally
surround
the
fourth
or
fifth
class;
that
they
refer
to
tort
claims
are
allowed
ahead
of
bond
holders
of
the
corporation.
they
do
not
refer
to
them
specifically
as
cost
of
administration
is.
i
read
those
cases.
they
rank
them
much
in
the
same
way
as
section
64
and
chapter
xi
rank
certain
classes
of
creditors.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
chapter
x,
yes
then
he
cites
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
and
i
think
--
as
we
point
out,
we
believe
that
some
tort
claims
could
be
allowable
in
this
type
of
proceeding
where
they
are
necessary,
where
they
are
covered
--
could
be
covered
by
a
liability
insurance,
for
instance
in
a
cab
operation.
surely
the
city
or
municipality
where
the
cab
company
is
operating
requires
liability
insurance.
i
do
not
believe
that
a
trustee
could
ignore
that
requirement
and
i
don't
think
the
insurance
company
could
defend
on
the
ground
for
the
trustee
is
not
liable
for
torts.
i
think
that
the
trustee's
insurance
would
cover
in
those
instances.
and
i
believe
that
in
this
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
would
think
the
performance
bond
could
be
looked
to.
in
fact,
there
is
one
company
here
who
is
suing
the
trustee
and
i
assume
they
are
looking
to
his
performance
bond
as
one
of
the
means
of
recovering.
i
think
also
that
they
would
look
to
the
bankrupt.
now,
in
this
instance,
absent
--
the
negligence
claims,
as
i
total
the
claims,
an
absence
--
tremendous
administrative
expenses,
which
are
not
as
yet
--
have
not
as
yet
been
allowed.
there
will
be
a
sum
remaining
in
this
bankruptcy.
if
you
total
the
creditors,
they
are
less
in
total
amount
than
their
limits
as
we
understand
that
it
will
be
recovered
under
the
fire
insurance
so
that
there
would
be
an
amount
that
would
go
back
to
the
bankrupt
if
he
were
discharged;
if
there
were
no
other
claim.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
as
i
understand,
it's
just
the
proceeds
to
the
insurance.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
now,
we
believe
that
this
court
in
nicholas
has
lead
away
to
the
--
a
way
that
the
court
claimant
here
could
have
recovered
or
could
have
at
least
presented
his
claim
if
he
had
met
the
requirements
of
63,
section
63
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
and
that
is
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no,
it
doesn't
deal
with
that
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
do
violence
to
the
bankruptcy
act
to
interpret
that
there
are
the
three
separate
periods,
which
is
the
periods,
free
bankruptcy,
there
is
the
chapter
xi
arrangement
period
and
then
there's
this
great
bankruptcy
period.
and
if
you
do
that,
then
a
tort
claim
would
--
during
the
chapter
xi
reorganization
would
come
in
as
a
general
creditor.
and
we
feel
that
that
is
the
equitable
result
to
reach
in
this
type
of
situation
that
there
he
shares
with
the
other
general
creditors.
it
is
merely
happen
--
instance
that
one
tort
claimant
would
be
three-bankruptcy
and
another
one,
chapter
xi
reorg
--
arrangement
proceeding,
tort
claimant.
in
fact,
in
many
cases,
mr.
justice
white
point
out
it
is
a
debtor
in
possession
who
is
operating
the
business
and
it's
the
same
person
operating
the
business
who
is
--
who
operated
three
chapter
xi
arrangements.
and
we
feel
that
in
no
circumstances
where
there
is
a
chapter
xi
that
it
would
no
violence
to
the
statute.
to
read
63
as
being
applicable
and
that
the
bankrupt
includes
the
period
pre
straight
bankruptcy.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
they
didn't
sue
in
time
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
preclude
them
completely,
your
honor.
it
might
rank
them
below
the
other
general
creditors
who've
had
then
diligent
and
who
have
sued.
well,
i
submit
that
it's
no
different
than
a
tort
claimant
who
might
have
had
the
same
thing
happen
three
days
prearrangement
in
any
circumstances.
there
are
some
creditors
who
are
not
going
to
get
paid
and
will
not
get
paid
in
full.
that
is
the
purpose
of
an
arrangement,
so
that
a
distressed
business
when
it
is
technically
insolvent
can
arrange
its
affair
so
that
it
may
survive
in
the
business
world.
and
it's
the
intent
of
congress
that
that
type
of
business
should
survive.
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
chapter
xi
arrangement
proceeding
that
they
have
a
way
of
arranging
their
businesses.
a
creditors
get
together
--
you
know,
i'm
sure
and
arrange
what
they
would
take
on
their
claims.
now,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
a
recovery.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cases
in
bankruptcy
involving
a
landlord
which
are
discussed
in
the
connor
case
in
this
court
cited
in
our
brief,
where
the
landlord
had
no
recovery
whatsoever,
this
is
the
instance
--
for
instance
where
the
premises
are
leased
to
a
business
for
a
long
period
of
time,
that
business
goes
bankrupt.
the
trustee
can
reject
the
lease
and
that's
an
action
of
the
trustee
in
rejecting
a
lease
not
the
bankrupt.
now,
prior
to
an
amendment
to
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
landlord
had
to
look
as
this
court
said
to
the
empty
shell,
the
corporation
for
any
recovery,
there
was
no
recovery
whatsoever.
congress
then
allowed,
taking
that
that
was
an
equitable
to
allow
him
no
recovery,
then
amended
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
to
allow
a
three-month
period
of
rent
to
the
landlord.
this
court
upheld
that
section
and
said
there
was
no
constitutional
restriction
of
that
type
on
the
lease;
that
the
landlord
was
not
entitled
to
damages
for
the
full
term
of
the
lease
and
we
submit
that
there's
no
problem
here
in
this
respect.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
believe
that
it
would
have
been
settled
as
other
claims
of
the
bankrupt
are
settled,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
in
a
--
rather
--
other,
oh
it
is
a
bankrupt
in
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
--
in
the
arrangement
proceeding.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
my
answer
to
that
is
no,
it's
not
an
expense
of
administration,
your
honor.
it
would
be
looked
on
under
our
view
in
this
way,
he
could
sue
the
trustee
and
then
if
the
business
then
goes
into
straight
bankruptcy,
he
would
be
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
understand
that.
but
if
he
does,
he
would
come
under
63
but
by
not
--
either
him
not
putting
it
on
the
straight
bankruptcy
or
other
creditors
not
putting
the
bankrupt
into
straight
bankruptcy.
our
position
is
that
he
would
then
share,
he
would
be
one
of
the
creditors
who
will
be
dealt
with
in
the
arrangement
proceedings.
now,
whether
he
accepts
the
proceedings
or
not,
as
i
read
the
arrangement,
chapter
xi
arrangement,
the
court
may
approve
a
proceeding
if
a
majority
of
the
creditors
approve
it.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
and
there's
--
the
trustee
has
been
discharged
there.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
why
i
think
of
the
plan
--
if
everything
has
worked
out,
as
i
understand
chapter
xi
proceedings,
if
everything
is
worked
out,
business
is
turned
back
to
the
debtor
and
he
operates
normally,
it's
not
by
trustee.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
if
the
remedy
is
there,
whether
it's
recoverable
or
not
will
depend
on
the
amount
of
money
available.
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
as
the
rests
of
the
debts,
yes.
it
would
then
be
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
correct.
we
say
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
i
think
its
provable
if
--
and
then
if
he
depends
whether
if
its
provable
in
a
straight
bankruptcy
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
they
had
started
their
suit
as
63
requires
prior
to
the
straight
bankruptcy
being
filed.
i
don't
believe
that
a
trustee
can
operate
a
business
and
not
have
claims
against
him
provable.
i
don't
believe
that
act
should
be
read
that
way.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it's
provable
in
bankruptcy
but
you
have
to
meet
certain
conditions
to
be
provable
in
bankruptcy
and
they
have
to
meet
those
conditions.
if
they
meet
those
conditions,
we
submit
under
our
argument
that
they
would
be
provable.
and
we
feel
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
this
case,
my
theory
is
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
if
as
to
which
remedy
is
sue
the
trustee
and
then
when
there
is
an
overages,
there
will
be
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it
will
share
in
that.
now,
counsel
for
the
bank,
for
the
claimant
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
there'll
be
--
there's
a
sum
of
money
available.
if
i
read
that
the
claims
have
been
totaled
correctly,
and
i
believe
that
they
have.
and
i
do
not
believe
the
cost
of
administration
although
there
are
litigation
expenses
i
have
no
idea
what
the
court
is
going
to
allow
as
a
cost
of
administration.
but
assume
that
the
cost
of
administration
is
not
great
enough
to
eat
up
what's
left,
there
will
be
something
here
for
these
claimants.
now,
yesterday
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
sure
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
the
reason
it
would
be
--
it
would
survive
bankruptcy
where
it's
not
proved.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
any
claim
that's
not
provable
is
not
discharged.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
this
--
well,
this
court
has
passed
on
this
question
on
several
railroad
cases
where
the
bankrupt
--
after
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
after
the
trustee,
and
equity
receivership
there.
it
would've
--
property
was
given
back
to
the
owner
and
the
claims
against
the
trustee
for
them
allowable
against
the
property
although
it
was
the
negligence
of
the
trustee.
they're
texas
and
pacific
railway
company,
the
johnson
at
151
u.s.,
81,
and
another
texas
in
pacific
railway
versus
bloom
at
164
u.s.
636.
now,
i
believe
that
in
that
instance
and
in
the
instance
that
was
resided
yesterday
where
goldmine
is
found
and
there's
$10,000,000
in
that
goldmine,
i
can't
believe
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
allow
the
claim
to
be
presented
against
the
bankrupt.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
personal
liability,
i
think
that
would
depend
on
the
negligence,
your
honor,
and
that
has
not
been
litigated
here
as
to
what
the
negligence
were.
the
allegations
of
negligence,
i
doubt
very
seriously,
that
they
would
warrant
a
personal
liability
of
the
trustee.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
he
said
the
bond,
if
i
understood,
he
said
that
the
bond
would
be
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
your
honor,
i
did
not
understand
his
argument
to
be
that
the
receiver
here
would
be
personally
liable
for
these
acts.
i
don't'
think
you
would
have
a
receiver
to
qualify
under
those
circumstances.
i
think
people
would
shy
away
for
the
receivership.
if
that's
the
outcome
of
this
case,
that
it's
--
he
is
to
be
personally
liable,
just
like
i
think
that
if
these
are
allowed
as
administration
expenses,
many
attorneys
are
going
to
hesitate
to
tell
other
claimants
or
other
would
be
claimants
then
suppliers
and
whatnot
to
do
business
in
a
chapter
xi
arrangement,
which
is
really
the
purpose
of
administration
expenses
or
allowing
them
as
administration
expenses
as
to
encourage
them
to
do
business
with
the
bankrupt
or
the
distressed
business.
and
if
anyone
who
is
a
lawyer
in
private
practice
was
approached
by
a
supplier,
was
advised,
“should
i
extend
credit
to
the
trustee?”
he's
going
to
have
to
consider
then
what
are
the
possible
limits
of
the
damage
claim
if
there
may
be
and
he'd
have
to
consider
the
type
of
business
and
anything
else
because
here,
the
people
who
would
extend
their
credit
and
who
have
attempted
to
assist
in
rehabilitating
the
bankrupt
are
going
to
have
to
share
pro
rata
if
these
are
administration
expenses.
and
they
would
be
penalized.
and
i
think
that
this
third
circuit
of
the
lower
court
here
were
correct
in
denying
these
claims
as
priority
claims.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
although
i
believe
that
if
he
had
presented
his
claim
as
a
creditor
in
the
arrangement
proceeding,
that
he
would
be
bound
by
that
proceeding.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
he's
just
a
creditor.
it
would
not
then
--
i
--
you've
correctly
summarized
our
position.
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
just
tell
a
moment
to
reply
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
thank
you
sir.
actually,
justice
fortas,
we
did
present
our
claim
during
the
arrangement
proceeding.
it
was
not
until
after
these
claims
were
presented.
not
--
it
was
not
until
may,
this
fire
occurred
in
january;
that
the
company
went
into
bankruptcy
and
we
considered
that
by
presenting
this
claim,
we
were
doing
the
equivalent,
starting
a
suit.
now,
i
would
like
to
lie
to
rest
the
contention
that
we
have
a
right,
first
of
all,
against
the
bankrupt.
i
do
not
sincerely
believe
we
could
possibly
have
a
claim
because
for
six
weeks,
he
had
been
out
of
control.
he
had
no
control
whatever
over
what
was
done
in
that
building.
this
was
an
engineer
who
was
hired
by
the
receiver
and
i
do
not
see
how
we
could
hold
the
bankrupt
responsible.
now,
our
claim
was,
as
i
say
presented
before
the
bankruptcy
occurred.
it
has
been
expunged
both
as
a
general
claim
and
as
an
administrative
expense
and
we
have
--
we
are
now
out
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
unless
the
judgment
is
reversed.
we
just
simply
had
no
standing
whatever.
now,
as
far
as
63
(a)
(7)
is
concerned,
that
appears
at
page
24
of
our
brief,
this
is
the
brief
for
petition
and
it
says,
“debts
of
the
bankrupt
may
be
proved
and
allowed
against
this
estate
which
are
founded
upon
the
following
things.”
now,
if
i
am
correct
and
i
don't
see
how
i
can
be
wrong
about
the
--
whether
this
is
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt,
if
i
am
correct,
then
certainly,
we
have
no
claim
under
the
section
63
because
this
covers
only
“debts
of
the
bankrupt”.
now
the
only
other
place
we
have
to
go
is
cost
and
expenses
of
administration.
there
is
no
other
place.
for
claims
against
the
receiver
which
arise
during
the
course
of
the
arrangement
or
during
the
course
of
bankruptcy,
and
well
i
must
confess
that
this
action
was
started
by
my
brother,
i
didn't
start
this
myself,
and
when
i
first
heard
that
he
had
started
a
claim,
this
was
expenses
of
administration,
i
had
the
same
reaction
that
some
of
your
honors
have
had
to
it
that
a
$3,500,000
doesn't
sound
like
an
expense
of
administration.
but
the
more
i
have
lived
with
this
thing,
i
can't
ask
your
honors,
to
spend
the
amount
of
time
thinking
about
that
i
have.
but
i
am
so
sure
that
this
can't
be
anything
else.
there's
no
other
place
to
go.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well
your
honor,
that
is
the
law
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
i
think
that
that
is
their
contention,
sir,
yes
but
this
is
--
this
has
been
the
law
of
some
states.
it
was
for
example,
the
law
of
new
york
when
vass
against
conron
brothers
was
decided.
but
it
is
not
as
i
understand
the
federal
law.
this
court
as
--
long
ago
as
i
think
141
u.s.
held
that
a
receiver
cannot
be
personally
liable.
it
was
a
rather
old
fashion
than
rather
a
devious
method.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
we
have
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
we
have
cited
a
case
at
the
end
of
our
--
i
think
it's
in
our
reply
brief,
which
holds
that
the
fact
that
you
got
a
judgment
in
a
separate
action
--
law,
establishes
only
the
amount
of
the
damages
but
also
that
you
have
a
claim
against
the
tortfeasor
but
unless
--
or
if
--
or
some
other
type
of
claim.
but
unless
the
claim
which
gave
rise
to
the
judgment
is
itself
provable,
the
judgment
is
not
provable
by
just
automatically.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
--
we
take
the
position
that
we
have
done
the
equivalent
of
suing
by
presenting
this
claim
for
-
--
we
of
course,
we
have
turned
to
the
administrative
expenses
but
it
was
expunged
not
only
for
that
but
under
63
(a)
(7).
now,
the
government
originally
said,
“well,
that's
quite
right”
and
then
now
they
say,
“well,
we
could
have
sued
under
63
(a)
(7)”
and
as
i
hope
i
have
demonstrated
to
your
honors,
i
just
don't
believe
that
we
have
any
such
thing.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
and
as
we
brought
suit,
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
as
long
--
i
have
always
questioned
whether
63
(a)
(7)
would
stand
up
if
somebody
really
wanted
to
give
it
to
give
it
back.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
yes
sir.
it
says
that.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
my
position
exactly,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
exactly
our
positions
here
that
we
--
that
these
people
--
we,
and
everybody
that
--
because
we
represent
now,
this
whole
$3,500,000
in
claims.
if
this
case
falls,
nobody
gets
a
nickel.
this
is
our
position
out
of
this
estate.
there
may
be
--
there's
some
insurance
proceeds.
this
is
the
first
time
i've
heard
that
there
was
policy,
which
i
think
we
would
be
entitled
to.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
the
question,
of
course
--
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
the
insurance
covers
the
trustee.
i
guess
it
does.
but
at
least
--
we
will
sue
the
receiver
on
the
grounds
not
that
he
personally
did
anything
but
that
his
agent
was
negligent.
that
is
our
theory
against
the
receiver.
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
