mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
petition
for
the
review
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
a
bankruptcy
case.
and
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
a
claim
for
damages
arising
out
of
the
negligence
of
the
receiver
while
operating
a
business
during
in
--
a
chapter
xi
proceeding,
what
subsequently
became
a
bankruptcy.
is
an
expense
of
administration
with
the
priority
to
which
such
expenses
are
entitled
or
whatever
it
has
no
standing
whatever.
the
i.j.
knight
realty
corporation
owned
and
operated
an
eight-story
industrial
building
in
philadelphia
known
as
the
fretz
building.
and
on
november
the
16th
1962,
knight
filed
a
petition
for
arrangement
under
chapter
xi
and
the
district
court
for
the
houston
district
appointed
a
receiver
and
authorized
him
to
operate
the
business
which
he
proceeded
to
do.
six
weeks
later,
on
the
first
of
january
1963,
the
fretz
building
was
totally
destroyed
by
a
disastrous
fire
which
has
been
described
as
the
worst
fire
that
philadelphia
ever
had.
and
a
large
number
of
adjoining
structures
were
destroyed
and
damaged
including
a
property
going
to
the
reading
company.
the
receivership
was
subsequently
terminated
and
knight
was
adjudicated
of
bankrupt
and
brown
was
then
elected
trustee.
the
reading
company
and
over
a
hundred
other
property
owners
whose
property
was
destroyed
in
the
fire
filed
claims
as
administrative
expenses
due
the
negligence
of
the
receiver.
and
the
trustee
thereafter
petitioned
the
referee
to
expunge
the
crime
not
only
as
an
expense
of
administration
but
also
as
a
general
unsecured
claim.
the
referee
did
expunge
the
claims,
expunged
the
reading
company
claim
and
he
also
ruled
that
the
reading
claim
should
be
a
test
case
for
all
of
the
hundred
some
odd
other
cases.
there
are
approximately
three
and
a
half
million
dollars
in
claims.
the
assets
--
the
estimate
at
the
time,
the
record
was
prepared,
were
between
$638,045
and
i
believe
that
the
--
that
figure
is
more
nearly
correct.
the
government
is
in
this
case
because
it
has
a
tax
claim
of
some
$245,000
relating
to
the
pre-petitioned
period
and
there
were
other
claims
amounting
to
about
$378,000.
the
district
court
for
the
houston
district
affirmed
the
referee
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court
with
three
judges
dissenting.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
16th
of
october
1962.
and
for
purposes
of
this
case,
it
is
admitted
that
this
fire
was
caused
when
an
engineer
hired
by
the
receiver
accidentally
attached
a
portable
heater
to
high-tension
wires
while
working
on
some
frozen
sprinkler
pipes.
knight
had
been
out
of
possession
as
i
said
for
approximately
six
weeks
so
that
the
bankrupt
could
not
be
held
responsible
for
the
engineer's
negligence.
a
consequent
--
this
is
a
claim
against
the
receiver
as
such
and
has
in
our
view
an
entirely
different
character
from
claims
against
the
bankrupt
which
arose
prior
to
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
now
the
cost
of
expenses
of
administration
are
provided
for
in
section
64a
(1)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
that
act
--
that
section
reads
in
part
as
follows,
debts
which
have
priority,
"the
debts
to
have
priority,
in
advance
of
the
payment
of
dividends
to
creditors,
and
to
be
paid
in
full
out
of
bankrupt
estates,
and
the
order
of
payment,
shall
be
(1)
the
costs
and
expenses
of
administration,
including
the
actual
and
necessary
costs
and
expenses
of
preserving
the
estate
subsequent
to
filing
the
petition."
the
term
"cost
and
expenses"
has
never
been
defined
by
congress
and
consequently,
we
argue
that
the
term
bears
the
meaning
which
had
been
required
over
the
years
in
other
insolvency
proceedings,
mainly
equity
receiverships.
claims
for
torts
committed
in
equity
receiverships
by
agents
of
the
receiver
have
absolutely
uniformly
been
held
to
be
expenses
of
administration
and
to
be
entitled
a
priority.
we've
cited
a
large
number
of
cases
in
our
brief
which
of
course,
i'm
not
going
to
refer
to
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
short
--
read
one
short
quotation
by
my
--
decision
by
this
court,
the
farmers'
loan
and
--
not
but
this
court
--
sorry,
it's
a
lower
court
case,
the
farmers'
loan
and
trust
company
versus
the
northern
pacific.
such
claims
for
injuries
occurring
in
the
receiver's
own
management
are
paid.
it
is
true.
in
preference
to
the
mortgaged
debt
not
for
the
reason
of
their
preferential
nature
nor
because
of
any
superior
equity
in
their
favor
over
claims
for
damages
which
arose
before
the
receiver
was
appointed.
but
because
there
are
liabilities
which
were
incurred
by
the
receiver
in
the
course
of
his
own
operation
of
the
road
and
are
payable
by
him
as
other
expenses
of
management.
now,
all
of
the
text
riders
that
we've
been
able
to
find,
every
single
one
without
exception
says
that
torts
committed
by
a
receiver
in
the
operation
of
the
business
and
i
make
no
distinction
between
equity
receiverships
and
bankruptcy
receiverships,
are
expenses
of
administration.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
no
sir,
as
such
in
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
did
--
i
think
there's
no
question
at
all
about
it.
i
made
no
distinction
at
all
as
long
as
the
tort
is
committed
by
an
agent
of
the
trustee
or
of
the
receiver
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
that
--
the
rules
of
equity
apply,
yes
sir,
i
believe
as
opposed
to
section
64.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
this
case,
sir,
because
i
think
it's
quite
clear
under
64
that
it
should
be
paid,
allows
expenses
of
administration.
collier
said
so
and
it's
interesting
to
me
that
the
government
quotes
collier
repeatedly
as
an
authority
but
it
does
--
but
in
no
place
do
they
quote
this
action,
it
says
that
these
are
payable
as
expenses
of
administration.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
it
makes
it
--
the
general
statement,
sir.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
yes,
can
you
find
that
for
me?
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
it's
in
the
brief,
sir,
yes.
well,
we
contend
to
any
other
result
where
--
would
manifest,
it'd
be
unjust.
chapter
xi
proceeding
contemplates
that
the
debtor
will
be
rehabilitated
and
it
is
of
course
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
creditors
and
of
it's
shareholders
and
we
contend
that
it
would
be
--
since
it's
being
operated
for
their
benefit,
that
to
permit
their
receiver
to
engage
in
business
which
would
benefit
these
general
creditors
and
yet
hold
that
they
are
immune
from
any
liability
for
tort
such
as
this
would
not
only
be
unjust
but
would
be
unconstitutional.
apparently,
everybody
concedes
that
contractual
liabilities
entered
into
by
the
receiver
are
proper
expenses
and
--
but
the
government
now
argues
that
tort
claims
have
no
standing
at
all.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
put
to
the
bond,
sir?
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
size
of
the
bond
but
such
is
not
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
because
it's
not
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
sir,
as
i
see
it.
if
it
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
amount
of
the
claim,
if
this
claim
amounted
to
$5,000
for
example,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
i
don't
think
they
would
even
have
contested
it
but
if
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
sir,
it's
because
--
i
say
that
if
a
tort
claim
is
a
cost
or
an
expense
by
the
administration
and
congress
has
seen
fit
to
give
those
expenses
a
number
one
priority
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
nature
of
the
claim
can
be
determined
or
should
be
determined
at
least
by
the
amount
of
the
tort
claims.
i
don't
think
that
just
because
the
--
receiver
was
so
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
even
know
that
a
bond
that
goes
to
--
into
this
area
isn't
a
bond,
a
fidelity
bond.
i
am
not
a
bankruptcy
expert
at
all
but
as
my
understanding
of
the
bond
is
primarily
a
fidelity
bond
there's
a
question
of
insurance
as
to
whether
he
took
out
insurance
or
not.
in
fact,
i
don't
know
but
obviously
he
did
take
out
very
much.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
should
be
that
that
--
the
question
of
whether
the
receiver
did
or
didn't
take
out
a
sufficient
bond
or
whether
he
was
grossly
negligent
instead
of
slightly
negligent
should
determine
the
issue
of
whether
these
are
properly
allowable
expenses
of
administration
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
you
mean,
the
day
before
bankruptcy
your
honor
or
the
day
before
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
sir,
but
there's
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
if
that's
the
receiver's
faults,
yes.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
perhaps
ought
to
switch
to
the
nicholas
case
which
was
decided
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
where
this
court
held
that
taxes
imposed
during
the
period
while
the
receiver
was
in
--
during
the
arrangement
as
well
as
penalties
were
properly
under
the
section
64a
(1)
expenses
of
administration
whereas
the
taxes
that
had
to
do
with
the
prearrangement
period
were
not.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
the
penalties
done
--
and
i
don't
think
that
the
--
i
think
the
penalties
are
even
more
remote
than
a
tort
claim.
i
think
that
it's
the
accident,
the
thing
that
has
given
all
of
the
?
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
the
penalties
are
for
failure
to
file
in
that
case,
for
a
failure
to
file
returns.
but
i
think
the
nicholas
case
and
as
well
as
the
boteler
case,
upon
which
it
was
based,
make
it
clear
that
there's
an
entirely
different
character
to
claims
that
arise
against
the
receiver
as
such.
the
receiver
is
only
liable
in
his
representative
capacity
and
it's
the
funds
under
his
control
that
are
to
be
charged
with.
he
isn't
liable
personally
and
i
think
that
the
--
all
i
can
say
that
the
fact
that
happened
during
the
receiver's
administration
has
uniformly
been
and
make
it
an
entirely
different
category.
i
have
some
other
cases,
sir.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
i
say
you
don't
make
any
distinction
between
the
claims
of
--
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
government's
argument
that
business
invitee
would
stand
on
a
different
category
from
somebody
who
just
happen
to
own
a
house
across
the
street.
i
say
there
isn't
any
difference.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
has,
of
course,
made
some
concessions
in
its
brief
which
is
contrary
to
what
it
made
before.
and
it
says
that
--
now,
it
says,
been
said
at
the
lower
courts
but
it
now
it
says
that
a
--
if
the
plaintiff
was
a
business
invitee,
he
would
be
entitled
to
share
what
the
--
this
would
be
a
business
expense.
well,
whether
you
didn't
realize
here
that
there's
some
business
invitees
whose
claims
had
been
wiped
out
by
this.
but
more
fundamentally
than
not,
i
know
of
absolutely
no
authority
whatever
for
the
proposition
that
because
a
claimant,
let
us
say,
here
was
--
who
had
at
least
property
on
the
second
floor
at
the
fretz
building,
let
us
say,
the
highest
property
destroyed.
as
oppose
to
a
plaintiff
who
own
a
house
across
the
street
which
was
burned
up
with
all
his
possessions.
that
the
tenant
should
be
paid
in
full
and
the
perfectly
innocent
property
owner
across
the
street
gets
nothing.
i
know
no
authority
for
sure.
i
don't
see
any
justice
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
such
authority
if
there
is,
however,
i
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
case
of
vass
against
conron
brothers
which
has
been
--
could
he
bitterly
attack
by
my
opponents,
is
good
authority
even
if
we
say
that
its
--
that
it
is
dictum.
i
don't
really
believe
that
it
is
ictum
but
in
vass,
the
facts
were
these.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
how
it
happened,
sir?
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
yes.
there
was
an
engineer
who
was
working
on
some
frozen
sprinkler
pipes.
i
think
he
was
trying
to
drain
the
pipes
so
he
could
get
the
sprinkle
system
working
again.
and
in
the
course
of
doing
that,
he
--
it
was
so
cold
that
night,
he
hooked
up
a
heater
to
the
--
i
think
it
was
the
barbs
that
runs
the
elevator
which
had
very
high
voltage.
and
of
course,
it
had
much
more
voltage
for
this
heater
then
he
must
have
gone
away
and
after
there,
it
caught
fire
and
set
fire
to
the
building.
and
with
no
sprinkler
system
and
with
a
high
wind
blowing,
and
it
reached
to
a
building.
it
just
became
an
absolute
holocaust
and
they
couldn't
get
it
out
for
hours
and
hours;
and
it
just
burned
everything
up
in
the
neighborhood.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
--
however,
the
business
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
however,
the
thing
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
the
operation
of
the
business
is
being
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
i.j.
knight
welding
company.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
take
an
example,
suppose
they
discovered
a
goldmine
in
the
ashes
of
this
building
so
that
i.j.
knight
was
worth
10
million
dollars.
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
cent
of
it
if
this
judgment
is
correct.
now,
the
statements
had
been
made.
we
could
have
filed
a
claim
on
the
63a
(7).
that's
not
accurate.
63a
(7)
by
its
terms
is
limited
to
claims
against
the
bankrupt.
this
was
not
and
never
could
be
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt.
and
therefore,
we
could
not
have
brought
suit
in
the
63a
(7).
now,
this
is
being
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
creditors
who'll
be
paid
absolutely
every
penny
if
this
judgment
stands.
i
see
no
justice
at
all
in
letting
them
take
away
$378,000
more
or
less
of
cash
when
the
business
which
is
being
operated
for
their
benefit
is
destroyed
by
the
negligence
of
their
own
representative.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
really
know
what
the
exact
basis
of
--
why
the
various
priorities
changed.
i
know
that
at
one
time,
taxes
for
example,
were
put
number
one
and
later
number
four.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
and
i
don't
--
i
think
in
all
honesty
i
would
have
to
say.
but
i
don't
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
three
and
a
half
million
dollar
fire
in
an
eight
hundred
thousand
dollar
estate
when
they
talk
about
expenses
that
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
you
say
--
connected,
the
continuing
business.
this
was
connected
to
it.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
i
know
that
vass
against
conron
brothers
which
i
was
about
to
refer
to
is
a
case
in
which
the
cold
storage
in
a
refrigerated
plant,
the
plaintiff
had
been
--
the
conron
brothers
had
been
a
tenant
in
the
plant
and
when
the
property
went
into
--
the
bankruptcy
was
adjudicated,
the
trustee,
vass,
confirmed
the
lease
because
he
didn't
try
to
throw
him
out.
he
continued
on
with
it
and
there
was
an
agreement
that
he
would
refrigerate
the
portion
of
the
plant
in
which
conron
brothers
had
their
property
and
he
permitted
that
to
breakdown.
and
the
result
was
that
conron
had
some
damages
and
it
came
up
--
this
is
the
1932
case
as
i
recall.
they
came
up
in
a
motion
to
enjoin
the
prosecution
of
the
estate
actions.
but
at
the
end
of
the
decision,
the
--
judge
hanft
said,
"the
liquidation
of
the
lessee's
resulting
damages
was
as
much
a
part
of
the
usual
administration
in
bankruptcy,
as
that
of
the
pay
of
accountants,
custodians
or
other
assistants
employed
by
the
trustee."
now
they
object
--
they
attacked
this
decision
on
two
grounds.
one
is
that,
in
referring
to
the
supreme
state
court.
there
were
two
counts.
the
first
said
that
vass
booked
the
contract;
the
second
said
he
was
negligent.
and
on
the
second
point,
judge
hand
said,
"that
has
nothing."
so
they
say,
"this
isn't
a
tort
case
at
all.
this
is
a
contract
case."
now
i
say
that
what
he
was
--
what
judge
hanft
was
saying
is
that
as
far
as
allowing
this
claim
in
--
bankruptcy
court
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
that
liability
is
incurred
because
he
broke
the
contract
or
because
he
did
it
negligently.
certainly,
i
don't
think
that
if
the
suit
had
been
brought,
alleging
simply
negligence
and
not
breach
of
contract,
that
there
would
have
been
any
different
result.
now,
i
think
that
this
case
--
they
also
savor
for
a
second
argument
that
this
is
dictum.
it's
a
pretty
cryptic
opinion
i
would
admit
but
i
think
that
the
only
basis
upon
which
judge
hand
could
have
put
this
end
was
that
the
must
have
been
made
that
it
would
have
been
illegal
and
unconstitutional
to
have
refused
to
give
--
permit
this
man
to
pursue
his
suit.
and
therefore,
he
said,
"well,
it's
alright
to
enjoin
because
we're
going
to
allow
it
as
an
expense
of
administration."
now,
does
that
--
i
don't
know
if
that
answers
your
honor's
question.
there
is
one
other
case
that's
directly
on
point
i
think,
in
re
(inaudible)
company,
which
is
a
lower
court
decision
in
which
there
was
a
rigid
patent
claim
which
was
allowed
as
an
expense
of
administration.
but
they
say
that
that
was
an
unjust
enrichment
case
which
i
didn't
--
certainly,
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
opinion.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
whether
that
point
was
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
on
the
same
stand,
i
never
went
there
before
to
read
them.
they
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
there
would've
been
no
particular
reason
to
put
it
in
for
that
--
there
hasn't
been
any
basis
or
so
it
seems
to
me.
well,
but
both
the
trustee
and
the
government
have
tried
to
say
that
the
tort
claims,
there's
something
tainted
about
a
tort
claim
that
just
because
it's
based
on
negligence
as
opposed
to
a
breach
of
contract
or
some
other
theory
of
the
law
that
in
order
to
be
(inaudible),
i
say
to
this
court
that
i
think
that
the
only
reason,
we
have
had
the
difficulty
that
we've
had
up
to
now
is
the
amount
of
the
claims.
just
last
year
where
mr.
justice
douglas
said
that
there's
an
overriding
consideration
that
equitable
principles
governing
the
exercise
of
bankruptcy
jurisdiction,
that's
the
bank
of
america
against
england
case.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
equitable
principles
require
that
the
--
that
this
be
considered
an
expense
of
administration
with
the
priority
which
congress
has
given
to
it
and
that
any
other
decision
is
a
--
unjust
and
i
submit,
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well
--
your
honor,
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
we
would
have
no
remedy.
the
effect
of
this
decision
is
to
say
that
we
have
no
remedy
at
all
because
we
can't
go
after
the
receiver
personally.
we
can't
go
after
the
bankrupt.
there
is
no
proceeding
anywhere.
there
is
no
provision
in
this
bankruptcy
act
anywhere
where
the
payment
of
a
claim
against
the
receiver
except
under
expenses
in
administrations
in
64a
(1).
i'm
talking
now
about
a
tort
of
a
receiver.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
they
say
--
they
say
--
your
honor,
they
said
that
we
had
a
--
we
had
a
claim
under
63a
(7)
but
may
i
point
out
that
the
preamble
of
63
says,
"debts
of
the
bankrupt
may
be
proved
and
allowed
against
his
estate
which
are
founded
upon
a
certain
number
of
things,
number
7,
which
is
this
tort."
now
this
is
as
i
have
said
to
you,
your
honor,
this
was
not
and
could
not
be
a
debt
of
the
bankrupt.
this
was
a
debt
which
was
incurred
by
the
receiver
only.
mr.
thomas
raeburn

your
honor,
section
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
but
your
honor,
we
can't
see
us
a
general
creditor.
section
63
will
not
permit
anybody
who
doesn't
have
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt
to
file
a
general
claim.
we
have
now
a
general
claim.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
it
can't
be,
your
honor.
section
63a
(7),
as
i
just
read.
it
says,
"debts
of
the
bankrupt
may
be
proved."
and
this
--
the
bankrupt
had
been
out
of
control
of
this
building
for
six
weeks.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
one
other
thing
out
where
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
entirely
possible
that
as
much
as
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
more
may
be
returned
to
the
bankrupt.
but
if
this
decision
stands,
we
won't
get
a
penny
of
it.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
a
lawsuit
cannot
automatically
be
proven.
your
honor
is
talking
about
a
common
lawsuit?
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
a
common
law
action
only
establishes
that
the
amount
of
the
damages
and
that
there
was
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt
but
it
may
not
be
proved.
the
--
even
the
judgment
may
not
be
proved
unless
the
claim
which
gave
rise
to
the
cause
of
action
is
itself
provable.
now
i
say
here,
that
we
couldn't
have
sued
the
bankrupt.
we
could
only
have
sued
the
receiver.
now,
if
we
--
suing
the
receiver
does
not
get
us
anywhere
unless
we
can
prove
it
as
either
as
a
preferred
claim
or
as
a
general
claim.
now,
as
i
say,
it
can't
be
a
general
claim,
mr.
justice
black.
it's
just
--
the
bankruptcy
act
doesn't
permit
it
and
the
only
place
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
--
where
a
claim
of
this
sort
against
the
receiver
can
be
proved,
it
is
64a
(1);
there's
no
other
place.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
if
whether
--
there
is
no
difference
on
my
judgment
sir.
however,
i
think
that
we
might
have
gone
after
the
debtor
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
is
the
tort
misfeasance.
well,
i
don't
know.
that's
--
it's
a
nice
question.
the
--
this
court
has
said
that
a
receiver
as
such
is
only
liable
in
his
representative
capacity
and
that
his
actions
--
in
mcnulta
versus
lochridge,
actions
against
the
receiver
or
in
law,
actions
against
the
receivership
for
the
funds
in
the
hands
of
the
receiver.
and
its
contracts,
misfeasances,
negligence
and
liabilities
are
official
and
not
personal
and
judgments
against
him
as
receiver
are
payable
only
from
the
funds
in
his
hands.
now,
28
u.s.c.section
959
it
says
that,
"a
receiver
shall
operate
a
business
--
that
is
a
receiver
in
a
case
before
the
federal
court,
--
shall
operate
the
business
as
though
he
were
person
or
corporation
running
a
business."
and
if
this
decision
is
allowed
to
stand,
this
means
that
they
can
act
as
they
like.
he
can
be
just
as
negligent.
and
if
--
of
course,
it's
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
there's
no
question
about
the
negligence
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
--
this
court
has
held
that
they
--
as
in
mcnulta
versus
lochridge
that
i've
just
read
said,
"such
claims
for
injuries
occurring
on
the
receivers
own
management
or
--
no,
i'm
sorry."
"actions
against
the
receiver
or
no
actions
against
the
receivership
or
the
funds
in
the
hands
of
the
receiver
and
his
contracts,
misfeasances,
negligences
and
liabilities
are
official
and
not
personal,
and
judgment
against
him
as
receiver
are
payable
only
from
the
funds
in
his
hand."
this
is
what
this
court
has
held.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
in
this
case,
sir?
no,
i
don't
read
the
lower
court
same
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
they
--
is
nothing.
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
it
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
no,
sir.
no
claim
survives
bankruptcy.
that
isn't
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt.
it
has
to
be
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt
to
survive
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
we
are
and
that
is
--
this
is
--
we
just
don't
have
any
remedy
after
all
under
this
decision
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
how
much
money
is
in
this
fund?
what's
it
--
unless
the
receiver
is
personally
liable
but
--
well,
if
your
honor
is
going
to
change
--
overrule
this
case,
perhaps.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
they
said
it's
not
--
it's
not
his
personal
responsibility.
that's
what
this
court
held.
i
say
to
the
court
that
under
this
decision,
we
have
no
place
to
go;
that
these
three-and-a-half
million
dollars
in
claims
are
--
going
to
get
not
one
penny
for
my
source--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
there
might
have
been,
sir.
i
honestly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
we
have
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
he
has
three-and-a-half
million
dollars
sir.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
petition
for
the
review
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
a
bankruptcy
case.
and
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
a
claim
for
damages
arising
out
of
the
negligence
of
the
receiver
while
operating
a
business
during
in
--
a
chapter
xi
proceeding,
what
subsequently
became
a
bankruptcy.
is
an
expense
of
administration
with
the
priority
to
which
such
expenses
are
entitled
or
whatever
it
has
no
standing
whatever.
the
i.j.
knight
realty
corporation
owned
and
operated
an
eight-story
industrial
building
in
philadelphia
known
as
the
fretz
building.
and
on
november
the
16th
1962,
knight
filed
a
petition
for
arrangement
under
chapter
xi
and
the
district
court
for
the
houston
district
appointed
a
receiver
and
authorized
him
to
operate
the
business
which
he
proceeded
to
do.
six
weeks
later,
on
the
first
of
january
1963,
the
fretz
building
was
totally
destroyed
by
a
disastrous
fire
which
has
been
described
as
the
worst
fire
that
philadelphia
ever
had.
and
a
large
number
of
adjoining
structures
were
destroyed
and
damaged
including
a
property
going
to
the
reading
company.
the
receivership
was
subsequently
terminated
and
knight
was
adjudicated
of
bankrupt
and
brown
was
then
elected
trustee.
the
reading
company
and
over
a
hundred
other
property
owners
whose
property
was
destroyed
in
the
fire
filed
claims
as
administrative
expenses
due
the
negligence
of
the
receiver.
and
the
trustee
thereafter
petitioned
the
referee
to
expunge
the
crime
not
only
as
an
expense
of
administration
but
also
as
a
general
unsecured
claim.
the
referee
did
expunge
the
claims,
expunged
the
reading
company
claim
and
he
also
ruled
that
the
reading
claim
should
be
a
test
case
for
all
of
the
hundred
some
odd
other
cases.
there
are
approximately
three
and
a
half
million
dollars
in
claims.
the
assets
--
the
estimate
at
the
time,
the
record
was
prepared,
were
between
$638,045
and
i
believe
that
the
--
that
figure
is
more
nearly
correct.
the
government
is
in
this
case
because
it
has
a
tax
claim
of
some
$245,000
relating
to
the
pre-petitioned
period
and
there
were
other
claims
amounting
to
about
$378,000.
the
district
court
for
the
houston
district
affirmed
the
referee
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court
with
three
judges
dissenting.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
16th
of
october
1962.
and
for
purposes
of
this
case,
it
is
admitted
that
this
fire
was
caused
when
an
engineer
hired
by
the
receiver
accidentally
attached
a
portable
heater
to
high-tension
wires
while
working
on
some
frozen
sprinkler
pipes.
knight
had
been
out
of
possession
as
i
said
for
approximately
six
weeks
so
that
the
bankrupt
could
not
be
held
responsible
for
the
engineer's
negligence.
a
consequent
--
this
is
a
claim
against
the
receiver
as
such
and
has
in
our
view
an
entirely
different
character
from
claims
against
the
bankrupt
which
arose
prior
to
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
now
the
cost
of
expenses
of
administration
are
provided
for
in
section
64a
(1)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
that
act
--
that
section
reads
in
part
as
follows,
debts
which
have
priority,
"the
debts
to
have
priority,
in
advance
of
the
payment
of
dividends
to
creditors,
and
to
be
paid
in
full
out
of
bankrupt
estates,
and
the
order
of
payment,
shall
be
(1)
the
costs
and
expenses
of
administration,
including
the
actual
and
necessary
costs
and
expenses
of
preserving
the
estate
subsequent
to
filing
the
petition."
the
term
"cost
and
expenses"
has
never
been
defined
by
congress
and
consequently,
we
argue
that
the
term
bears
the
meaning
which
had
been
required
over
the
years
in
other
insolvency
proceedings,
mainly
equity
receiverships.
claims
for
torts
committed
in
equity
receiverships
by
agents
of
the
receiver
have
absolutely
uniformly
been
held
to
be
expenses
of
administration
and
to
be
entitled
a
priority.
we've
cited
a
large
number
of
cases
in
our
brief
which
of
course,
i'm
not
going
to
refer
to
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
short
--
read
one
short
quotation
by
my
--
decision
by
this
court,
the
farmers'
loan
and
--
not
but
this
court
--
sorry,
it's
a
lower
court
case,
the
farmers'
loan
and
trust
company
versus
the
northern
pacific.
such
claims
for
injuries
occurring
in
the
receiver's
own
management
are
paid.
it
is
true.
in
preference
to
the
mortgaged
debt
not
for
the
reason
of
their
preferential
nature
nor
because
of
any
superior
equity
in
their
favor
over
claims
for
damages
which
arose
before
the
receiver
was
appointed.
but
because
there
are
liabilities
which
were
incurred
by
the
receiver
in
the
course
of
his
own
operation
of
the
road
and
are
payable
by
him
as
other
expenses
of
management.
now,
all
of
the
text
riders
that
we've
been
able
to
find,
every
single
one
without
exception
says
that
torts
committed
by
a
receiver
in
the
operation
of
the
business
and
i
make
no
distinction
between
equity
receiverships
and
bankruptcy
receiverships,
are
expenses
of
administration.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
no
sir,
as
such
in
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
did
--
i
think
there's
no
question
at
all
about
it.
i
made
no
distinction
at
all
as
long
as
the
tort
is
committed
by
an
agent
of
the
trustee
or
of
the
receiver
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
that
--
the
rules
of
equity
apply,
yes
sir,
i
believe
as
opposed
to
section
64.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
this
case,
sir,
because
i
think
it's
quite
clear
under
64
that
it
should
be
paid,
allows
expenses
of
administration.
collier
said
so
and
it's
interesting
to
me
that
the
government
quotes
collier
repeatedly
as
an
authority
but
it
does
--
but
in
no
place
do
they
quote
this
action,
it
says
that
these
are
payable
as
expenses
of
administration.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
it
makes
it
--
the
general
statement,
sir.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
yes,
can
you
find
that
for
me?
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
it's
in
the
brief,
sir,
yes.
well,
we
contend
to
any
other
result
where
--
would
manifest,
it'd
be
unjust.
chapter
xi
proceeding
contemplates
that
the
debtor
will
be
rehabilitated
and
it
is
of
course
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
creditors
and
of
it's
shareholders
and
we
contend
that
it
would
be
--
since
it's
being
operated
for
their
benefit,
that
to
permit
their
receiver
to
engage
in
business
which
would
benefit
these
general
creditors
and
yet
hold
that
they
are
immune
from
any
liability
for
tort
such
as
this
would
not
only
be
unjust
but
would
be
unconstitutional.
apparently,
everybody
concedes
that
contractual
liabilities
entered
into
by
the
receiver
are
proper
expenses
and
--
but
the
government
now
argues
that
tort
claims
have
no
standing
at
all.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
put
to
the
bond,
sir?
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
size
of
the
bond
but
such
is
not
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
because
it's
not
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
sir,
as
i
see
it.
if
it
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
amount
of
the
claim,
if
this
claim
amounted
to
$5,000
for
example,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
i
don't
think
they
would
even
have
contested
it
but
if
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
sir,
it's
because
--
i
say
that
if
a
tort
claim
is
a
cost
or
an
expense
by
the
administration
and
congress
has
seen
fit
to
give
those
expenses
a
number
one
priority
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
nature
of
the
claim
can
be
determined
or
should
be
determined
at
least
by
the
amount
of
the
tort
claims.
i
don't
think
that
just
because
the
--
receiver
was
so
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
even
know
that
a
bond
that
goes
to
--
into
this
area
isn't
a
bond,
a
fidelity
bond.
i
am
not
a
bankruptcy
expert
at
all
but
as
my
understanding
of
the
bond
is
primarily
a
fidelity
bond
there's
a
question
of
insurance
as
to
whether
he
took
out
insurance
or
not.
in
fact,
i
don't
know
but
obviously
he
did
take
out
very
much.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
should
be
that
that
--
the
question
of
whether
the
receiver
did
or
didn't
take
out
a
sufficient
bond
or
whether
he
was
grossly
negligent
instead
of
slightly
negligent
should
determine
the
issue
of
whether
these
are
properly
allowable
expenses
of
administration
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
you
mean,
the
day
before
bankruptcy
your
honor
or
the
day
before
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
sir,
but
there's
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
if
that's
the
receiver's
faults,
yes.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
perhaps
ought
to
switch
to
the
nicholas
case
which
was
decided
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
where
this
court
held
that
taxes
imposed
during
the
period
while
the
receiver
was
in
--
during
the
arrangement
as
well
as
penalties
were
properly
under
the
section
64a
(1)
expenses
of
administration
whereas
the
taxes
that
had
to
do
with
the
prearrangement
period
were
not.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
the
penalties
done
--
and
i
don't
think
that
the
--
i
think
the
penalties
are
even
more
remote
than
a
tort
claim.
i
think
that
it's
the
accident,
the
thing
that
has
given
all
of
the
?
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
the
penalties
are
for
failure
to
file
in
that
case,
for
a
failure
to
file
returns.
but
i
think
the
nicholas
case
and
as
well
as
the
boteler
case,
upon
which
it
was
based,
make
it
clear
that
there's
an
entirely
different
character
to
claims
that
arise
against
the
receiver
as
such.
the
receiver
is
only
liable
in
his
representative
capacity
and
it's
the
funds
under
his
control
that
are
to
be
charged
with.
he
isn't
liable
personally
and
i
think
that
the
--
all
i
can
say
that
the
fact
that
happened
during
the
receiver's
administration
has
uniformly
been
and
make
it
an
entirely
different
category.
i
have
some
other
cases,
sir.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
i
say
you
don't
make
any
distinction
between
the
claims
of
--
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
government's
argument
that
business
invitee
would
stand
on
a
different
category
from
somebody
who
just
happen
to
own
a
house
across
the
street.
i
say
there
isn't
any
difference.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
has,
of
course,
made
some
concessions
in
its
brief
which
is
contrary
to
what
it
made
before.
and
it
says
that
--
now,
it
says,
been
said
at
the
lower
courts
but
it
now
it
says
that
a
--
if
the
plaintiff
was
a
business
invitee,
he
would
be
entitled
to
share
what
the
--
this
would
be
a
business
expense.
well,
whether
you
didn't
realize
here
that
there's
some
business
invitees
whose
claims
had
been
wiped
out
by
this.
but
more
fundamentally
than
not,
i
know
of
absolutely
no
authority
whatever
for
the
proposition
that
because
a
claimant,
let
us
say,
here
was
--
who
had
at
least
property
on
the
second
floor
at
the
fretz
building,
let
us
say,
the
highest
property
destroyed.
as
oppose
to
a
plaintiff
who
own
a
house
across
the
street
which
was
burned
up
with
all
his
possessions.
that
the
tenant
should
be
paid
in
full
and
the
perfectly
innocent
property
owner
across
the
street
gets
nothing.
i
know
no
authority
for
sure.
i
don't
see
any
justice
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
such
authority
if
there
is,
however,
i
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
case
of
vass
against
conron
brothers
which
has
been
--
could
he
bitterly
attack
by
my
opponents,
is
good
authority
even
if
we
say
that
its
--
that
it
is
dictum.
i
don't
really
believe
that
it
is
ictum
but
in
vass,
the
facts
were
these.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
how
it
happened,
sir?
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
yes.
there
was
an
engineer
who
was
working
on
some
frozen
sprinkler
pipes.
i
think
he
was
trying
to
drain
the
pipes
so
he
could
get
the
sprinkle
system
working
again.
and
in
the
course
of
doing
that,
he
--
it
was
so
cold
that
night,
he
hooked
up
a
heater
to
the
--
i
think
it
was
the
barbs
that
runs
the
elevator
which
had
very
high
voltage.
and
of
course,
it
had
much
more
voltage
for
this
heater
then
he
must
have
gone
away
and
after
there,
it
caught
fire
and
set
fire
to
the
building.
and
with
no
sprinkler
system
and
with
a
high
wind
blowing,
and
it
reached
to
a
building.
it
just
became
an
absolute
holocaust
and
they
couldn't
get
it
out
for
hours
and
hours;
and
it
just
burned
everything
up
in
the
neighborhood.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
--
however,
the
business
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
however,
the
thing
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
the
operation
of
the
business
is
being
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
i.j.
knight
welding
company.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
take
an
example,
suppose
they
discovered
a
goldmine
in
the
ashes
of
this
building
so
that
i.j.
knight
was
worth
10
million
dollars.
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
cent
of
it
if
this
judgment
is
correct.
now,
the
statements
had
been
made.
we
could
have
filed
a
claim
on
the
63a
(7).
that's
not
accurate.
63a
(7)
by
its
terms
is
limited
to
claims
against
the
bankrupt.
this
was
not
and
never
could
be
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt.
and
therefore,
we
could
not
have
brought
suit
in
the
63a
(7).
now,
this
is
being
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
creditors
who'll
be
paid
absolutely
every
penny
if
this
judgment
stands.
i
see
no
justice
at
all
in
letting
them
take
away
$378,000
more
or
less
of
cash
when
the
business
which
is
being
operated
for
their
benefit
is
destroyed
by
the
negligence
of
their
own
representative.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
really
know
what
the
exact
basis
of
--
why
the
various
priorities
changed.
i
know
that
at
one
time,
taxes
for
example,
were
put
number
one
and
later
number
four.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
and
i
don't
--
i
think
in
all
honesty
i
would
have
to
say.
but
i
don't
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
three
and
a
half
million
dollar
fire
in
an
eight
hundred
thousand
dollar
estate
when
they
talk
about
expenses
that
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
you
say
--
connected,
the
continuing
business.
this
was
connected
to
it.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
i
know
that
vass
against
conron
brothers
which
i
was
about
to
refer
to
is
a
case
in
which
the
cold
storage
in
a
refrigerated
plant,
the
plaintiff
had
been
--
the
conron
brothers
had
been
a
tenant
in
the
plant
and
when
the
property
went
into
--
the
bankruptcy
was
adjudicated,
the
trustee,
vass,
confirmed
the
lease
because
he
didn't
try
to
throw
him
out.
he
continued
on
with
it
and
there
was
an
agreement
that
he
would
refrigerate
the
portion
of
the
plant
in
which
conron
brothers
had
their
property
and
he
permitted
that
to
breakdown.
and
the
result
was
that
conron
had
some
damages
and
it
came
up
--
this
is
the
1932
case
as
i
recall.
they
came
up
in
a
motion
to
enjoin
the
prosecution
of
the
estate
actions.
but
at
the
end
of
the
decision,
the
--
judge
hanft
said,
"the
liquidation
of
the
lessee's
resulting
damages
was
as
much
a
part
of
the
usual
administration
in
bankruptcy,
as
that
of
the
pay
of
accountants,
custodians
or
other
assistants
employed
by
the
trustee."
now
they
object
--
they
attacked
this
decision
on
two
grounds.
one
is
that,
in
referring
to
the
supreme
state
court.
there
were
two
counts.
the
first
said
that
vass
booked
the
contract;
the
second
said
he
was
negligent.
and
on
the
second
point,
judge
hand
said,
"that
has
nothing."
so
they
say,
"this
isn't
a
tort
case
at
all.
this
is
a
contract
case."
now
i
say
that
what
he
was
--
what
judge
hanft
was
saying
is
that
as
far
as
allowing
this
claim
in
--
bankruptcy
court
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
that
liability
is
incurred
because
he
broke
the
contract
or
because
he
did
it
negligently.
certainly,
i
don't
think
that
if
the
suit
had
been
brought,
alleging
simply
negligence
and
not
breach
of
contract,
that
there
would
have
been
any
different
result.
now,
i
think
that
this
case
--
they
also
savor
for
a
second
argument
that
this
is
dictum.
it's
a
pretty
cryptic
opinion
i
would
admit
but
i
think
that
the
only
basis
upon
which
judge
hand
could
have
put
this
end
was
that
the
must
have
been
made
that
it
would
have
been
illegal
and
unconstitutional
to
have
refused
to
give
--
permit
this
man
to
pursue
his
suit.
and
therefore,
he
said,
"well,
it's
alright
to
enjoin
because
we're
going
to
allow
it
as
an
expense
of
administration."
now,
does
that
--
i
don't
know
if
that
answers
your
honor's
question.
there
is
one
other
case
that's
directly
on
point
i
think,
in
re
(inaudible)
company,
which
is
a
lower
court
decision
in
which
there
was
a
rigid
patent
claim
which
was
allowed
as
an
expense
of
administration.
but
they
say
that
that
was
an
unjust
enrichment
case
which
i
didn't
--
certainly,
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
opinion.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
whether
that
point
was
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
on
the
same
stand,
i
never
went
there
before
to
read
them.
they
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
there
would've
been
no
particular
reason
to
put
it
in
for
that
--
there
hasn't
been
any
basis
or
so
it
seems
to
me.
well,
but
both
the
trustee
and
the
government
have
tried
to
say
that
the
tort
claims,
there's
something
tainted
about
a
tort
claim
that
just
because
it's
based
on
negligence
as
opposed
to
a
breach
of
contract
or
some
other
theory
of
the
law
that
in
order
to
be
(inaudible),
i
say
to
this
court
that
i
think
that
the
only
reason,
we
have
had
the
difficulty
that
we've
had
up
to
now
is
the
amount
of
the
claims.
just
last
year
where
mr.
justice
douglas
said
that
there's
an
overriding
consideration
that
equitable
principles
governing
the
exercise
of
bankruptcy
jurisdiction,
that's
the
bank
of
america
against
england
case.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
equitable
principles
require
that
the
--
that
this
be
considered
an
expense
of
administration
with
the
priority
which
congress
has
given
to
it
and
that
any
other
decision
is
a
--
unjust
and
i
submit,
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well
--
your
honor,
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
we
would
have
no
remedy.
the
effect
of
this
decision
is
to
say
that
we
have
no
remedy
at
all
because
we
can't
go
after
the
receiver
personally.
we
can't
go
after
the
bankrupt.
there
is
no
proceeding
anywhere.
there
is
no
provision
in
this
bankruptcy
act
anywhere
where
the
payment
of
a
claim
against
the
receiver
except
under
expenses
in
administrations
in
64a
(1).
i'm
talking
now
about
a
tort
of
a
receiver.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
they
say
--
they
say
--
your
honor,
they
said
that
we
had
a
--
we
had
a
claim
under
63a
(7)
but
may
i
point
out
that
the
preamble
of
63
says,
"debts
of
the
bankrupt
may
be
proved
and
allowed
against
his
estate
which
are
founded
upon
a
certain
number
of
things,
number
7,
which
is
this
tort."
now
this
is
as
i
have
said
to
you,
your
honor,
this
was
not
and
could
not
be
a
debt
of
the
bankrupt.
this
was
a
debt
which
was
incurred
by
the
receiver
only.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
section
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
but
your
honor,
we
can't
see
us
a
general
creditor.
section
63
will
not
permit
anybody
who
doesn't
have
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt
to
file
a
general
claim.
we
have
now
a
general
claim.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
it
can't
be,
your
honor.
section
63a
(7),
as
i
just
read.
it
says,
"debts
of
the
bankrupt
may
be
proved."
and
this
--
the
bankrupt
had
been
out
of
control
of
this
building
for
six
weeks.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
one
other
thing
out
where
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
entirely
possible
that
as
much
as
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
more
may
be
returned
to
the
bankrupt.
but
if
this
decision
stands,
we
won't
get
a
penny
of
it.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
honor,
a
lawsuit
cannot
automatically
be
proven.
your
honor
is
talking
about
a
common
lawsuit?
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
a
common
law
action
only
establishes
that
the
amount
of
the
damages
and
that
there
was
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt
but
it
may
not
be
proved.
the
--
even
the
judgment
may
not
be
proved
unless
the
claim
which
gave
rise
to
the
cause
of
action
is
itself
provable.
now
i
say
here,
that
we
couldn't
have
sued
the
bankrupt.
we
could
only
have
sued
the
receiver.
now,
if
we
--
suing
the
receiver
does
not
get
us
anywhere
unless
we
can
prove
it
as
either
as
a
preferred
claim
or
as
a
general
claim.
now,
as
i
say,
it
can't
be
a
general
claim,
mr.
justice
black.
it's
just
--
the
bankruptcy
act
doesn't
permit
it
and
the
only
place
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
--
where
a
claim
of
this
sort
against
the
receiver
can
be
proved,
it
is
64a
(1);
there's
no
other
place.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
if
whether
--
there
is
no
difference
on
my
judgment
sir.
however,
i
think
that
we
might
have
gone
after
the
debtor
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
is
the
tort
misfeasance.
well,
i
don't
know.
that's
--
it's
a
nice
question.
the
--
this
court
has
said
that
a
receiver
as
such
is
only
liable
in
his
representative
capacity
and
that
his
actions
--
in
mcnulta
versus
lochridge,
actions
against
the
receiver
or
in
law,
actions
against
the
receivership
for
the
funds
in
the
hands
of
the
receiver.
and
its
contracts,
misfeasances,
negligence
and
liabilities
are
official
and
not
personal
and
judgments
against
him
as
receiver
are
payable
only
from
the
funds
in
his
hands.
now,
28
u.s.c.section
959
it
says
that,
"a
receiver
shall
operate
a
business
--
that
is
a
receiver
in
a
case
before
the
federal
court,
--
shall
operate
the
business
as
though
he
were
person
or
corporation
running
a
business."
and
if
this
decision
is
allowed
to
stand,
this
means
that
they
can
act
as
they
like.
he
can
be
just
as
negligent.
and
if
--
of
course,
it's
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
there's
no
question
about
the
negligence
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
your
--
this
court
has
held
that
they
--
as
in
mcnulta
versus
lochridge
that
i've
just
read
said,
"such
claims
for
injuries
occurring
on
the
receivers
own
management
or
--
no,
i'm
sorry."
"actions
against
the
receiver
or
no
actions
against
the
receivership
or
the
funds
in
the
hands
of
the
receiver
and
his
contracts,
misfeasances,
negligences
and
liabilities
are
official
and
not
personal,
and
judgment
against
him
as
receiver
are
payable
only
from
the
funds
in
his
hand."
this
is
what
this
court
has
held.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
in
this
case,
sir?
no,
i
don't
read
the
lower
court
same
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
they
--
is
nothing.
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
it
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
no,
sir.
no
claim
survives
bankruptcy.
that
isn't
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt.
it
has
to
be
a
claim
against
the
bankrupt
to
survive
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
we
are
and
that
is
--
this
is
--
we
just
don't
have
any
remedy
after
all
under
this
decision
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
how
much
money
is
in
this
fund?
what's
it
--
unless
the
receiver
is
personally
liable
but
--
well,
if
your
honor
is
going
to
change
--
overrule
this
case,
perhaps.
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
they
said
it's
not
--
it's
not
his
personal
responsibility.
that's
what
this
court
held.
i
say
to
the
court
that
under
this
decision,
we
have
no
place
to
go;
that
these
three-and-a-half
million
dollars
in
claims
are
--
going
to
get
not
one
penny
for
my
source--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
there
might
have
been,
sir.
i
honestly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
we
have
--
mr.
thomas
raeburn
white,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
he
has
three-and-a-half
million
dollars
sir.
