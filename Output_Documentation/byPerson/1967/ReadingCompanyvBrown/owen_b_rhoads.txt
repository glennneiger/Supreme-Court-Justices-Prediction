mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
enter
two
questions
which
were
asked
by
mr.
white
yesterday,
by
members
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
black
asked
how
the
fire
started.
on
the
record,
this
is
a
fire
of
undetermined
origin.
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
we
of
course
have
admitted
negligence
of
the
receiver
but
it's
a
fire
of
undetermined
origin.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
whether
and
about
the
availability
of
the
bond.
the
bond
is
a
performance
bond.
it
is
available,
of
course.
its
amount
doesn't
meet
the
enormous
claims
here.
this
matter
would
be
here
no
matter
what
the
amount,
i
believe,
because
we
feel
so
strongly
that
this
claim,
an
unliquidated
claim
for
property
damages,
arising
from
a
negligence
a
receiver
during
a
chapter
xi
proceeding
is
not
entitled
to
the
first
status
priority
which
claimants
seek.
as
your
honors
have
said
in
recent
cases,
very
recent
cases,
where
a
priority
is
sought,
the
burden
on
the
claimant
is
a
very
heavy
one.
and
may
i
quote
your
honor's
words
in
the
case
of
nathanson
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
which
this
court
said
the
theme
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
equality
of
distribution.
and
if
one
claimant
is
to
be
preferred
over
others,
the
purpose
should
be
clear
from
the
statute.
we
submit
that
there's
no
such
clarity
here.
the
act
is
unim
--
is
unambiguous.
if
claimant
is
to
succeed,
he
must
concisely
and
convincingly
bring
the
claim
within
section
64,
subsection
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
that
act
provides
that
cost
and
expenses
of
administration,
including
the
actual
and
necessary
cost
and
expenses
of
preserving
the
estate
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition,
are
entitled
a
first
priority.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
expenses
of
carrying
on
that
business,
your
honor,
most
certainly
are
cost
and
expenses
of
administration,
provided
they
are
necessary
and
this
necessary
is
based
on
the
definition
and
narrow
wording
of
the
statute
and
there
can
be
no
question.
if
the
costs
are
necessary
such
as
are
closely
and
approximately
related
to
the
carrying
on
the
business,
costs
which
can
be
reasonably
anticipated.
they
are
cost
of
administrations
entitled
of
first
priority.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
would
be
dealt
with
under
section
77
on
the
railroad
reorganization
sections
which
in
--
which
codify
the
equitable
principle.
they
are
not
applicable
to
either
chapter
xi
or
the
liquidating
bankruptcy
proceedings.
congress
has
of
--
has
provided
for
a
different
set
of
rules
applicable
to
situations
involving
railroads
as
the
acts
so
clearly
shows
in
section
77
(n).
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
it's
necessary
to
carry
on
the
business,
your
honor,
it
is
a
cost
and
expense
of
administration.
but
there
is
nothing
necessary
about
negligence
in
the
use
of
the
word
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
your
honor
please,
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
that
the
cost
of
repairs,
cost
which
go
directly
to
either
developing,
preserving
or
liquidating
in
a
estate
are
cost
and
--
as
an
expense
of
administration.
but
uncontemplated,
negligent
results
--
expenses,
which
result
from
such
things
cannot
be
considered
necessary.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
necessity
and
negligence
are
emphatetical
in
the
language.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
therefore.
and
i
think
that
practice
will
show
that
the
payment
of
the
insurance
premium
such
as
to
establish
the
estate
here
are
reasonable
cost
and
necessary
cost.
this
is,
they
contemplate
the
carrying
on
of
a
business.
it's
the
reasonableness
not
the
failure
to
act
as
a
reasonable
man
which
comes
into
this
definition
of
actual
and
necessary.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
to
me
the
act
is
unambiguous
because
you
must
read
section
64
subsection
(a)
(1)
in
the
light
of
the
definition
section
and
it
is
cost
and
expenses
of
administration
are
defined
in
this
act.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
this
is
a
very
interesting
--
intellectual
--
my
point
of
view,
under
the
act
expressly
worded,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
think
a
more
strict
view
of
the
act
than
the
government
does.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
think
that
it
is
possible
that
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
and
tripping
--
coming
in
your
dry
cleaning
establishment
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
coming
in
and
tripping
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
continuing
developing
aspect?
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
this
is
very
interesting.
this
is
very
close.
i
disagree
on
the
act
as
it
a
--
as
it
pre
--
readilly
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
think
this
should
be
for
congress.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no
claim.
my
position
is
a
very
strict
one
and
it
would
be
that
no
claim.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
knight
really
leased
--
it
was
an
industrial
building
of
8-storey
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
a
cost
of
repair?
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
would
say
that
this
is
not
a
cost
and
expense
of
administration
as
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
as
provided
for
in
the
act.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
necessary
expenses.
you
cannot
read
this
act.
the
administrative
expenses
cannot
be
read
separate
from
the
word
“necessary”.
in
64(a)
(1),
you
have
the
words
“cost
and
expenses
of
administration”,
including
the
“actual
and
necessary
cost”
preserving
the
estate
subsequent
to
filing
the
petition.
now,
obviously,
these
are
not,
this
claim
is
not
within
the
“including
the
actual
and
necessary
cost
of
filing
subsequent
to
the
petition.”
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no
question
of
the
cost
of
that
would
be
an
expense.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no,
because
again
you're
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
it
would
--
if
--
i
mean
it
might
well
have
been
but
we
are
not
concerned
with
a
chapter
x
proceeding
here
because
--
that
you
have
a
different
set
of
rules,
a
greater
adoption
or
adaptation
into
the
procedures
provided
by
congress
of
looser
roles.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes,
your
honor.
they
--
there
are
specific
sections
of
the
act
which
incorporate
all
of
the
liquidating
bankruptcy
provisions
in
the
chapter
xi
proceedings
and
say
that
chapter
xi
proceedings
are
governed
by
that
section
of
the
procedures
as
established
by
the
act
and
by
no
others
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
with
chapter
xi.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
and
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
in
the
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it's
correct.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
in
a
very
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no,
but
the
preservation
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
elements
of
both
are
the
same.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes,
your
honor.
at
times
it
is
the
debtor
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
who's
in
possession
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
so
in
this
case.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
to
read
the
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
receiver
is
the
trust
--
that
the
trustee
here
was
the
receiver.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
correct.
and
it
is
a
--
it
is
--
your
chapter
xi
is
a
rehabilitation
proceeding
but
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
it
is
--
but
it
is
not
always
the
debtor
in
possession.
it
is
a
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
aim
was
to
rehabilitate
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
and
to
operate
the
business
just
as
in
liquidating
bankruptcies
quite
often
there's
a
period
of
considerable
length
of
operating
the
business
and
attempt
to
preserve
and
to
secure
the
maximum
equitable
distribution
upon
general
creditors
of
the
greatest
asset
possible.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
reading
company
has
--
i
submit,
your
honor,
two
remedies.
the
bond,
as
suggested
by
mr.
chief
justice
which
is
of
course
in
amount
is
inadequate.
it
also
has
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
think
it's
a
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
don't
think
there's
any
question.
it's
a
performance
bond.
now
it
may
be
that
courts
shouldn't
require
larger
bonds
than
they
had.
but
it's
a
performance
bond
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
would
--
your
honor,
i
must
say
i
have
not
read
the
terms
of
that
bond
carefully
not
to
say
with
certainty.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
but
i
assume
it
is.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
there's
no
question,
this
is
part
of
the
administration
but
it's
not
every
cost
and
expense
in
the
administration
which
is
entitled
to
the
first
priority.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
plenary
suit.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
mr.
white,
my
opponent
already
has
a
plenary
suit,
which
is
referred
to
in
one
of
my
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
witness.
against
the
i.j.
knight
--
the
receiver,
i.j.
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it's
against
francis
shunk
brown
as
receiver.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
personal
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
the
liability.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
those
are
the
only
two
remedies
that
i
can
think
of.
i
think
that
it's
the
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
--
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
were
an
estate
of
the
company
which
survived
liquidation
as
in
mr.
white's
suggestion
yesterday
of
discovering
the
$10,500,000
goldmine,
there's
no
question
that
the
receiver
standing
in
the
position
of
the
debtor
that
that
estate
would
be
liable
and
the
reading
company
with
its
three
million
five
would
come
out
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
more
than
that.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
this
is
a
claim
which
isn't
discharged
by
bankruptcy.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
and
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it's
a
claim
against
the
estate
because
the
receiver
in
being
sued
stands
in
the
position
of
the
bankrupt
under
the
act.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
he
has
no
priority
claim
for
where
it
say
“negligence”
claim
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
under
the
act.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
not
having
occur
under
the
act,
not
had
the
--
tort,
not
having
occurred
prior
to
the
filing
of
petition
and
no
suit
having
been,
as
the
act
requires,
filed
and
pending
prior
to
the
filing
of
this,
he
does
not
serve,
he
does
not
come
in
as
a
general
creditor.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
he
comes
in
as
a
claim,
undischarged
in
bankruptcy
because
it
is
one
not
provable
under
the
act
and
would
be
on
the
same
position
as
any
negligent
--
judgment
creditor
against
an
insolvent
individual
whether
there
had
been
no
bankruptcy.
this
is
a
statutory
proceeding
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
the
--
there
must
be
a
convincing
establishment
of
a
right
to
this
priority.
and
if
you
take
the
words
of
this
act,
that
the
words
of
this
act
as
i
have
attempted
to
indicate
if
the
only
words
that
this
can
--
claim
can
be
possibly
be
hang
on
are
cost
and
expenses
of
administration.
now,
cost
and
expenses
of
administration
are
defined
by
section
62
subsection
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
the
act
uses
the
words
“the
costs
of
administering
this
section
of
the
act”.
it
uses
the
word,
“the
cost
of
administering
the
estate”
and
it
defines
them
as
the
actual
and
necessary
cost
incurred
by
officers
other
than
referee
in
the
administration
of
estates.
the
word
“necessary”
is
again
emphasized.
it
cannot
be
ignored
and
as
i
have
said
in
my
opinion,
there
is
no
necessity
in
negligence
and
necessary
and
negligence
or
antithetical
words.
an
unliquidated
tort
claim
such
as
this
has
no
place
in
as
a
first
priority.
this
is
shown
not
only
by
the
strict
wording
of
the
act
but
is
also
shown
by
congress'
consideration
of
negligence
claims
here
--
of
tort
claims
in
amendments
of
the
act
and
on
occasions
when
it
has
considered
amending
the
act.
this
has
occurred
twice.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
there
would
have
if
the
negligence
which
we've
admitted
been
established
in
claims,
they
would
have
recovered
out
of
the
rehabilitated
business.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
and
probably
the
public
liability
policy.
the
receivers
and
trustees
take
public
liability
policies
out
and
it
is
to
this
sort
of
reasonable,
actual,
necessary
expense
that
these
claims
look.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
liability?
yes.
mr.
marx,
who
is
my
co-counsel
here
advised
me
there's
a
public
liability
policy
but
obviously
not
adequate
enough
for
anything
like
this.
and
if
your
honor
pleases,
congress
has
considered
whether
tort
negative
claims
based
on
negligence
should
be
even
allowed
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
in
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
1933,
congress
considered
and
codified
under
the
railroad
reorganization
section
of
the
act,
giving
a
right
to
and
giving
a
--
in
this
case,
giving
a
priority
to
claims
for
personal
injuries,
to
employees
of
a
railroad
corporation,
claims
of
personal
representatives
of
deceased
employees
of
railroad
corporations.
this
by
section
77
(n)
gives
a
priority
to
these
two
tort
claims
in
railroad
reorganization.
but
note
well,
no
priority
is
given
to
property
damage
claims
based
on
negligence
and
no
mention
is
made
of
property
damage
claims
based
on
negligence.
congress
was
considering
torts
at
that
time.
now
again,
a
year
later,
congress
considered
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
so
i
believe,
your
honor;
in
my
reading
of
the
section,
yes.
this
is
a
case
based
of
course
on
the
continued
operation
of
the
railroad.
this
is
a
rehabilitation
proceeding.
if
your
honors,
please,
a
year
later
in
1934,
congress
provided
by
section
63,
subsection
(a)
(7)
that
claims
in
negligence
where
the
suit
had
been
pending
prior,
have
been
instituted
and
pending,
prior
to
the
institution
of
the
petition,
were
provable
claims
and
those
are
the
only
negligence
claim
which
are
provable
claims
in
a
liquidating
bankruptcy
and
it
is
only
by
section
62
subsection
(a)
(1)
that
cost
and
expense
of
administration
are
provable.
and
that
section
limits
those
provable
costs
and
expenses
to
actual
and
necessary
ones.
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
history
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
is
to
preserve
an
estate
for
liquidation
and
the
wording
of
the
act,
i
submit
all,
on
all
three
grounds,
show
that
this
claim
does
--
is
not
a
claim
which
convincingly
can
be
established
as
a
priority
claim
and
to
grant
it
would
frustrate
the
policy
which
congress
has
established.
it
may
be
wrong
philosophically
but
it
is
a
policy
established
by
congress
in
the
wording
of
this
act
and
allows
and
makes
no
provision
for
claims
such
as
this.
to
grant
it
would
frustrate
the
act
completely.
thank
you,
your
honors.

owen

may
answer
your
honor,
in
--
the
city
has
condemned
the
land.
the
proceeds
of
that
will
be
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
part
of
the
estate.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
enter
two
questions
which
were
asked
by
mr.
white
yesterday,
by
members
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
black
asked
how
the
fire
started.
on
the
record,
this
is
a
fire
of
undetermined
origin.
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
we
of
course
have
admitted
negligence
of
the
receiver
but
it's
a
fire
of
undetermined
origin.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
whether
and
about
the
availability
of
the
bond.
the
bond
is
a
performance
bond.
it
is
available,
of
course.
its
amount
doesn't
meet
the
enormous
claims
here.
this
matter
would
be
here
no
matter
what
the
amount,
i
believe,
because
we
feel
so
strongly
that
this
claim,
an
unliquidated
claim
for
property
damages,
arising
from
a
negligence
a
receiver
during
a
chapter
xi
proceeding
is
not
entitled
to
the
first
status
priority
which
claimants
seek.
as
your
honors
have
said
in
recent
cases,
very
recent
cases,
where
a
priority
is
sought,
the
burden
on
the
claimant
is
a
very
heavy
one.
and
may
i
quote
your
honor's
words
in
the
case
of
nathanson
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
which
this
court
said
the
theme
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
equality
of
distribution.
and
if
one
claimant
is
to
be
preferred
over
others,
the
purpose
should
be
clear
from
the
statute.
we
submit
that
there's
no
such
clarity
here.
the
act
is
unim
--
is
unambiguous.
if
claimant
is
to
succeed,
he
must
concisely
and
convincingly
bring
the
claim
within
section
64,
subsection
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
that
act
provides
that
cost
and
expenses
of
administration,
including
the
actual
and
necessary
cost
and
expenses
of
preserving
the
estate
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition,
are
entitled
a
first
priority.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
expenses
of
carrying
on
that
business,
your
honor,
most
certainly
are
cost
and
expenses
of
administration,
provided
they
are
necessary
and
this
necessary
is
based
on
the
definition
and
narrow
wording
of
the
statute
and
there
can
be
no
question.
if
the
costs
are
necessary
such
as
are
closely
and
approximately
related
to
the
carrying
on
the
business,
costs
which
can
be
reasonably
anticipated.
they
are
cost
of
administrations
entitled
of
first
priority.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
would
be
dealt
with
under
section
77
on
the
railroad
reorganization
sections
which
in
--
which
codify
the
equitable
principle.
they
are
not
applicable
to
either
chapter
xi
or
the
liquidating
bankruptcy
proceedings.
congress
has
of
--
has
provided
for
a
different
set
of
rules
applicable
to
situations
involving
railroads
as
the
acts
so
clearly
shows
in
section
77
(n).
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
it's
necessary
to
carry
on
the
business,
your
honor,
it
is
a
cost
and
expense
of
administration.
but
there
is
nothing
necessary
about
negligence
in
the
use
of
the
word
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
your
honor
please,
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
that
the
cost
of
repairs,
cost
which
go
directly
to
either
developing,
preserving
or
liquidating
in
a
estate
are
cost
and
--
as
an
expense
of
administration.
but
uncontemplated,
negligent
results
--
expenses,
which
result
from
such
things
cannot
be
considered
necessary.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
necessity
and
negligence
are
emphatetical
in
the
language.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
therefore.
and
i
think
that
practice
will
show
that
the
payment
of
the
insurance
premium
such
as
to
establish
the
estate
here
are
reasonable
cost
and
necessary
cost.
this
is,
they
contemplate
the
carrying
on
of
a
business.
it's
the
reasonableness
not
the
failure
to
act
as
a
reasonable
man
which
comes
into
this
definition
of
actual
and
necessary.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
to
me
the
act
is
unambiguous
because
you
must
read
section
64
subsection
(a)
(1)
in
the
light
of
the
definition
section
and
it
is
cost
and
expenses
of
administration
are
defined
in
this
act.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
this
is
a
very
interesting
--
intellectual
--
my
point
of
view,
under
the
act
expressly
worded,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
think
a
more
strict
view
of
the
act
than
the
government
does.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
think
that
it
is
possible
that
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
and
tripping
--
coming
in
your
dry
cleaning
establishment
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
coming
in
and
tripping
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
continuing
developing
aspect?
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
this
is
very
interesting.
this
is
very
close.
i
disagree
on
the
act
as
it
a
--
as
it
pre
--
readilly
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
think
this
should
be
for
congress.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no
claim.
my
position
is
a
very
strict
one
and
it
would
be
that
no
claim.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
knight
really
leased
--
it
was
an
industrial
building
of
8-storey
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
a
cost
of
repair?
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
would
say
that
this
is
not
a
cost
and
expense
of
administration
as
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
as
provided
for
in
the
act.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
necessary
expenses.
you
cannot
read
this
act.
the
administrative
expenses
cannot
be
read
separate
from
the
word
“necessary”.
in
64(a)
(1),
you
have
the
words
“cost
and
expenses
of
administration”,
including
the
“actual
and
necessary
cost”
preserving
the
estate
subsequent
to
filing
the
petition.
now,
obviously,
these
are
not,
this
claim
is
not
within
the
“including
the
actual
and
necessary
cost
of
filing
subsequent
to
the
petition.”
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no
question
of
the
cost
of
that
would
be
an
expense.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no,
because
again
you're
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
it
would
--
if
--
i
mean
it
might
well
have
been
but
we
are
not
concerned
with
a
chapter
x
proceeding
here
because
--
that
you
have
a
different
set
of
rules,
a
greater
adoption
or
adaptation
into
the
procedures
provided
by
congress
of
looser
roles.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes,
your
honor.
they
--
there
are
specific
sections
of
the
act
which
incorporate
all
of
the
liquidating
bankruptcy
provisions
in
the
chapter
xi
proceedings
and
say
that
chapter
xi
proceedings
are
governed
by
that
section
of
the
procedures
as
established
by
the
act
and
by
no
others
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
with
chapter
xi.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
and
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
in
the
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it's
correct.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
in
a
very
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no,
but
the
preservation
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
elements
of
both
are
the
same.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes,
your
honor.
at
times
it
is
the
debtor
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
who's
in
possession
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
so
in
this
case.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
to
read
the
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
receiver
is
the
trust
--
that
the
trustee
here
was
the
receiver.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
correct.
and
it
is
a
--
it
is
--
your
chapter
xi
is
a
rehabilitation
proceeding
but
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
it
is
--
but
it
is
not
always
the
debtor
in
possession.
it
is
a
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
aim
was
to
rehabilitate
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
and
to
operate
the
business
just
as
in
liquidating
bankruptcies
quite
often
there's
a
period
of
considerable
length
of
operating
the
business
and
attempt
to
preserve
and
to
secure
the
maximum
equitable
distribution
upon
general
creditors
of
the
greatest
asset
possible.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
reading
company
has
--
i
submit,
your
honor,
two
remedies.
the
bond,
as
suggested
by
mr.
chief
justice
which
is
of
course
in
amount
is
inadequate.
it
also
has
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
think
it's
a
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
don't
think
there's
any
question.
it's
a
performance
bond.
now
it
may
be
that
courts
shouldn't
require
larger
bonds
than
they
had.
but
it's
a
performance
bond
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
would
--
your
honor,
i
must
say
i
have
not
read
the
terms
of
that
bond
carefully
not
to
say
with
certainty.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
but
i
assume
it
is.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
there's
no
question,
this
is
part
of
the
administration
but
it's
not
every
cost
and
expense
in
the
administration
which
is
entitled
to
the
first
priority.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
plenary
suit.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
mr.
white,
my
opponent
already
has
a
plenary
suit,
which
is
referred
to
in
one
of
my
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
witness.
against
the
i.j.
knight
--
the
receiver,
i.j.
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it's
against
francis
shunk
brown
as
receiver.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
personal
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
the
liability.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
those
are
the
only
two
remedies
that
i
can
think
of.
i
think
that
it's
the
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
--
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
were
an
estate
of
the
company
which
survived
liquidation
as
in
mr.
white's
suggestion
yesterday
of
discovering
the
$10,500,000
goldmine,
there's
no
question
that
the
receiver
standing
in
the
position
of
the
debtor
that
that
estate
would
be
liable
and
the
reading
company
with
its
three
million
five
would
come
out
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
more
than
that.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
this
is
a
claim
which
isn't
discharged
by
bankruptcy.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
and
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it's
a
claim
against
the
estate
because
the
receiver
in
being
sued
stands
in
the
position
of
the
bankrupt
under
the
act.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
he
has
no
priority
claim
for
where
it
say
“negligence”
claim
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
under
the
act.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
not
having
occur
under
the
act,
not
had
the
--
tort,
not
having
occurred
prior
to
the
filing
of
petition
and
no
suit
having
been,
as
the
act
requires,
filed
and
pending
prior
to
the
filing
of
this,
he
does
not
serve,
he
does
not
come
in
as
a
general
creditor.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
he
comes
in
as
a
claim,
undischarged
in
bankruptcy
because
it
is
one
not
provable
under
the
act
and
would
be
on
the
same
position
as
any
negligent
--
judgment
creditor
against
an
insolvent
individual
whether
there
had
been
no
bankruptcy.
this
is
a
statutory
proceeding
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
the
--
there
must
be
a
convincing
establishment
of
a
right
to
this
priority.
and
if
you
take
the
words
of
this
act,
that
the
words
of
this
act
as
i
have
attempted
to
indicate
if
the
only
words
that
this
can
--
claim
can
be
possibly
be
hang
on
are
cost
and
expenses
of
administration.
now,
cost
and
expenses
of
administration
are
defined
by
section
62
subsection
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
the
act
uses
the
words
“the
costs
of
administering
this
section
of
the
act”.
it
uses
the
word,
“the
cost
of
administering
the
estate”
and
it
defines
them
as
the
actual
and
necessary
cost
incurred
by
officers
other
than
referee
in
the
administration
of
estates.
the
word
“necessary”
is
again
emphasized.
it
cannot
be
ignored
and
as
i
have
said
in
my
opinion,
there
is
no
necessity
in
negligence
and
necessary
and
negligence
or
antithetical
words.
an
unliquidated
tort
claim
such
as
this
has
no
place
in
as
a
first
priority.
this
is
shown
not
only
by
the
strict
wording
of
the
act
but
is
also
shown
by
congress'
consideration
of
negligence
claims
here
--
of
tort
claims
in
amendments
of
the
act
and
on
occasions
when
it
has
considered
amending
the
act.
this
has
occurred
twice.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
there
would
have
if
the
negligence
which
we've
admitted
been
established
in
claims,
they
would
have
recovered
out
of
the
rehabilitated
business.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
and
probably
the
public
liability
policy.
the
receivers
and
trustees
take
public
liability
policies
out
and
it
is
to
this
sort
of
reasonable,
actual,
necessary
expense
that
these
claims
look.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
liability?
yes.
mr.
marx,
who
is
my
co-counsel
here
advised
me
there's
a
public
liability
policy
but
obviously
not
adequate
enough
for
anything
like
this.
and
if
your
honor
pleases,
congress
has
considered
whether
tort
negative
claims
based
on
negligence
should
be
even
allowed
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
in
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
1933,
congress
considered
and
codified
under
the
railroad
reorganization
section
of
the
act,
giving
a
right
to
and
giving
a
--
in
this
case,
giving
a
priority
to
claims
for
personal
injuries,
to
employees
of
a
railroad
corporation,
claims
of
personal
representatives
of
deceased
employees
of
railroad
corporations.
this
by
section
77
(n)
gives
a
priority
to
these
two
tort
claims
in
railroad
reorganization.
but
note
well,
no
priority
is
given
to
property
damage
claims
based
on
negligence
and
no
mention
is
made
of
property
damage
claims
based
on
negligence.
congress
was
considering
torts
at
that
time.
now
again,
a
year
later,
congress
considered
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
so
i
believe,
your
honor;
in
my
reading
of
the
section,
yes.
this
is
a
case
based
of
course
on
the
continued
operation
of
the
railroad.
this
is
a
rehabilitation
proceeding.
if
your
honors,
please,
a
year
later
in
1934,
congress
provided
by
section
63,
subsection
(a)
(7)
that
claims
in
negligence
where
the
suit
had
been
pending
prior,
have
been
instituted
and
pending,
prior
to
the
institution
of
the
petition,
were
provable
claims
and
those
are
the
only
negligence
claim
which
are
provable
claims
in
a
liquidating
bankruptcy
and
it
is
only
by
section
62
subsection
(a)
(1)
that
cost
and
expense
of
administration
are
provable.
and
that
section
limits
those
provable
costs
and
expenses
to
actual
and
necessary
ones.
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
history
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
is
to
preserve
an
estate
for
liquidation
and
the
wording
of
the
act,
i
submit
all,
on
all
three
grounds,
show
that
this
claim
does
--
is
not
a
claim
which
convincingly
can
be
established
as
a
priority
claim
and
to
grant
it
would
frustrate
the
policy
which
congress
has
established.
it
may
be
wrong
philosophically
but
it
is
a
policy
established
by
congress
in
