justice
potter
stewart
the
government
does
disagree
with
you
on
that
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
general
creditor
under
63a
(7).
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that's
the
reason
--
the
main
reason
for
that
is
that
you
didn't
file
a
lawsuit,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
which
is
under
63a
(7)
--
a
common
law
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
has
to
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
it's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
it
has
been
a
debtor,
it
have
possession
instead
of
a
receiver
under
chapter
xi?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
nothing
--
had
nothing,
it's
a
claim
that
survives
bankruptcy.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yes,
you've
--
so
you
say
it's
not
a
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
government
in
its
brief,
as
i
read
it,
seems
to
concede
that
some
torts
might
be
cost
of
administration.
in
your
answer
to
justice
black,
did
i
detect
to
your
agreement
with
that
and
otherwise
let's
assume
that
this
is
not
a
railroad
which
is
covered
by
different
statute
but
a
dry
cleaning
establishment
and
one
of
its
trucks
doing
a
chapter
xi
interval,
one
of
its
trucks
delivering
clean
clothes
to
the
customers
that
negligently
struck
somebody.
would
that
be
--
would
that
kind
of
a
tort
be
in
your
view
under
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
not
be.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
customer
coming
in
to
the
store
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
no
tort
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
no
claims
and
negligence
of
any
kind?
justice
potter
stewart
performance
bond
too?
justice
potter
stewart
performance
bond
too
with
the
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
even
so
in
this
particular
case
the
reading
company
couldn't
get
a
benefit
of
that
because
they
didn't
sue
in
time,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
even
in
your
argument
as
to
--
under
63
(a)
(7)
since
the
suite
was
not
filed
in
time
here,
this
petitioner,
the
reading
company,
it
can't
take
advantage
of
that
and
so
in
this
case,
what
is
your
theory?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
which
remedy,
do
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
will

and
this
will
--
justice
potter
stewart
after
discharge,
you
mean
after
discharge
there
will
be
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
--
because
there'll
be
something
which
--
to
which
it
is
entitled,
why?
because
they
have
claims
that
survived
bankruptcy
not
having
been
provable
in
bankruptcy?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
that.
but
this

this
of

was
not
