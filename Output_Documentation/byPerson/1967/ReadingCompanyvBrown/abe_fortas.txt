justice

i
suppose
that
really
the
question
is
whether
the
category

narrowly
construed

those
things
that
are
necessary
to
unable
the
business
to
continue

during

act

i

you
can
--
you
can
fit
most
everything
in
there
that
has
been
covered
by
the
cases
including
the
payment
of
taxes.
and
on
that
theory,
i
suppose
your

argues
that
the

of
a

claim
has
nothing
whatever
to

with

perhaps
seems
to

the

justice

i

what
you're

is
to

yes,

it
is
--

let

what's

you
said
they're

justice

against

justice

personal

justice

fortas
and
if
he
--
and
if
the

has
to

and
mr.

has
to

here,
he
has
no
recourse
over
against
the

of
the

does
he?
justice

fortas
well
if
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
that's
just
to
ring
around
the
rose,
he
had
in
that,
not
clear
if
that's
a
correct
theory
because
what
you're
saying
now
--
the
following,
as
i
understand
it,
there's
a
fire
caused
by
the
negligence
of
the
receiver.
the
receiver
can
be
sued
on
his
personal
capacity.
the
receiver
then
has
recourse
over
against
the
bankrupt
estate.
now
if
that
is
so,
then
in
that
effect
of
this
is
that
the
bankrupt
estate
for
whatever
it
may
be,
whatever
may
be
in
that
estate
is
liable
to
the
persons
suffering
from
tort.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
you
are
saying,
it's
a
claim
against
the
estate
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
not
just
a
claim
against
the
receiver?
justice
abe
fortas
now
what
you're
saying
is
that
it's
a
--
it
is
not
entitled.
it's
a
claim,
which
is
not
entitled
to
--
oh,
it
can't
be
that
either.
suppose
a
receiver
had
judgments
obtained
against
the
receiver
while
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
is
still
pending
then
the
receiver
has
a
claim
over
against
the

you've
tell
me
for
--
to
be
made
whole,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
suppose
the
bankruptcy
is
still
pending,
he
has
at
least
a
general
claim
against

does
he
have
a
priority
claim
as
the

of
the

justice

fortas
or
does
--
where
does

rank?
justice

fortas
does
this
claim
rank
along

justice

fortas
and
how
does
he
come
in?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't'
believe
that
the

has
personal

even
after
he's

justice
abe
fortas
because
i
got
the
--
presume
that
the
preceding
counsel
took
the
opposite
view.
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
he
went
further
than
that
and
said
that
there
would
be
personal
liability
on
the
part
of
the
receiver
and
i
gather
that,
perhaps
wrong,
that
his
position
was
that
--
to
me
personal
liability
on
the
part
of
the
receiver
even
if
there
were
no
willfulness
that
it's
just
straight
negligence.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
but
let
me
see
if
i
correctly
understand
your
position.
your
position
is
that
chapter
xi
proceeding
is
pending,
if
the
litigation
has
started
on
a
tort
claim
prior
to
bankruptcy,
the
chapter
xi
merging
into
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
then
by
virtue
of
63
(a),
that's
provable,
right?
that's
point
one.
justice
abe
fortas
point
2,
if
chapter
xi
and
it
goes
on
to
the
end,
an
arrangement
among
creditors,
without
any
bankruptcy
proceeding
then
hopefully
the
tort
claim
will
be
settled
out
whether
or
not
a
suit
has
been
filed
just
by
an
informal
arrangements
among
claimants,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
if
it
is
not
settled
out,
this
is
third
possibility,
in
the
chapter
xi
proceeding.
and
if
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
does
not
merge
into
a
bankruptcy
or
the
next,
if
the
litigation
has
not
begun
before
bankruptcy,
then
the
claim
survives
against
the
company
as
it
immerges
from
the
chapter
xi
or
straight
bankruptcy
proceedings.
in
that
event,
until
your
position
is
and
until
--
at
least
until
the
trustee
is
discharged,
a
suit
may
be
brought
against
the
trustee.
recovery
may
--
do
you
think
be
had
on
his
bond?
that
liability
of
the
trustee
may
be
established
than
that
may
--
a
claim
may
thereby
be
asserted
against
the
bankrupt
estate?
have
i
summarized
that
correctly
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
wouldn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
he's
just
a
claimant.
in
my
case,
he
had
introduced
his
tort
claim,
the
judgment.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
about
the
other
theory
that's
been
discussed
here
this
morning,
that
this
is
to
say
that
this
is
a
tort
committed
by
the
trustee,
receiver
trustee,
that
an
action
may
be
brought
against
him
and
that
the
recovery
and
it
went
to
--
his
liability
is
established,
there
--
recovery
can
be
had
and
he
has
a
claim
over
against
the
estate.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
what
you
understand
of
defense
just
in
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
are
two
things
here.
one,
that
is
to
be
personally
liable
and
then
a
variant
of
that
suggested
by
counsel
for
the
government
that
he
could
be
sued
and
that
a
liability
would
be
--
would
then
be
after
judgment
was
obtained
against
the
trustee,
a
liability
will
then
be
the
liability
of
the
estate.
justice
abe
fortas
i
must
confess,
i'm
a
little
confused
as
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
precise
meaning
of
these
two
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
the
tort
had
at
this
part,
it
had
occurred
three
days
before
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
and
no
question
with
that
--
it
would
have
been
a
tort
that
would
not
--
there
would've
been
a
claim
not
provable
in
chapter
xi
or
subsequent
bankruptcy.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
unless
you
have
brought
suit
before
the
petition
was
filed.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
but
that
was
--
that's
what
statute
said,
didn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
so
that
the
schemes
of
statutes
are
arguable
as
such
you
draw
a
line,
you
erect
a
chinese
wall
at
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
insofar
as
tort
claims
are
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
now
here,
you
have
a
tort
that
occurred
during
the
period
of
the
administration
under
chapter
xi
and
you
are
saying
that
the
--
that
does
not
--
that
tort
claim
does
not
survive.
that's
not
a
claim
against
the
debtor
as
the
debtor
emerges
from
chapter
xi
or
from
the
subsequent
bankruptcy
proceeding.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
also
you
have
no
claim
against
the
trustee
personally?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
unless
you
have
a
claim
against
the
assets,
against
the
bankrupt
or
the
debtor
under
chapter
xi
that
you
have
no
recourse
whatsoever?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
really
the
question
is
whether
the
category
of
administrative
expense
ought
to
be
narrowly

those
things
that
are
necessary
to
unable
the
business
to

can

you
can
fit
most
everything
in
there
that
has
been
covered
by
the
cases
including
the
payment
of
taxes.
and
on
that
theory,
i

your

argues
that
the

have
brought
suit
before
the
petition
was
filed.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
but
that
was
--
that's
what
statute
said,
didn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
so
that
the
schemes
of
statutes
are
arguable
as
such
you
draw
a
line,
you
erect
a
chinese
wall
at
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
insofar
as
tort
claims
are
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
now
here,
you
have
a
tort
that
occurred
during
the
period
of
the
administration
under
chapter
xi
and
you
are
saying
that
the
--
that
does
not
--
that
tort
claim
does
not
survive.
that's
not
a
claim
against
the
debtor
as
the
debtor
emerges
from
chapter
xi
or
from
the
subsequent
bankruptcy
proceeding.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
also
you
have
no
claim
against
the
trustee
personally?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
unless
you
have
a
claim
against
the
assets,
against
the
bankrupt
or
the
debtor
under
chapter
xi
that
you
have
no
recourse
whatsoever?
