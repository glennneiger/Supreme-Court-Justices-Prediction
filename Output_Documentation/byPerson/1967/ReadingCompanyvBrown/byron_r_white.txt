justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
find
any
--
put
any
significance
in
the
fact
that
this
is
chapter
xi
rather
than
straight
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
same
result
should
occur
if
the
trustee
in
bankrupt
--
straight
bankruptcy
had
taken
possession
of
this
building
and
then
invert
down
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although
i
suppose
you
would
concede
it's
much
clearer
in
the
chapter
x
than
this
would
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think
the
difference
between
the
rule
under
chapter
x
and
the
rule
under
xi
which
uses
64
is
--
a
difference
in
the
context
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
collier
really
said
--
say
it
on
the
facts
somewhere
to
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
citation
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
alright.
it's
in
your
brief
and
i
have
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
gather
that
if
the
building
had
burned
the
day
before
bankruptcy
why
--
your
--
this
would
just
been
a
general
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
day
before
the
arrangement
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
now
could
it
--
you
say
if
it
burns
the
day
after
however,
the
day
after
the
petitioners
filed
and
a
receiver
has
pointed
that
it
does
become
an
administration
expense.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
receiver
really
has
to
change
anything
in
the
24
hours,
it's
the
same
building,
it's
the
same
situation,
why
and
what
is
the
--
what
has
the
adjoining
owner's
building
has
damaged
to
done
--
to
further
the
goals
of
the
receivership?
i
grant
you
that
most
administration
expenses
are
given
priority
for
a
given
priority
for
reason.
and
what
reason
that
normally
underlies
priority
for
administration
expenses
does
indicate
priority
for
this
kind
of
a
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
taxes
represents
service
from
--
represent
payment
for
governmental
services.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
penalties
were
supported
by
the
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
tort
claims
stand
on
the
same
example
in
the
--
all
torts
of
receivers
stand
on
exactly
the
same
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
distinct
--
between
one
tort
or
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
vital
authority
on
this
whole
principle?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
very
little.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
provision
that
says
64
is
applicable
says
that
insofar
as
consistent
with
--
and
insofar
is
not
inconsistent
with
this
chapter.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
difference
between
the
aims
of
chapter
xi
and
the
aims
of
bankruptcy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
must
--
there's
nothing
that
--
there's
no
way
to
rehabilitate
anything
straight
bankruptcy
and
there
certainly
is
in
chapter
xi.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
and
normally
you
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
but
normally
you
don't
continue
a
business
and
with
--
and
you
don't
run
a
business
in
bankruptcy.
you
liquidate
a
business.
you
--
and
in
xi,
the
whole
idea
is
to
keep
the
business
going
and
use
this
--
the
debtor
in
possession.
and
the
--
so
the
whole
object
is
to
continue
the
business
and
to
operate
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
times
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
always
is
in
xi.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
during
the
xi
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
say
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
get
a
petition
under
chapter
xi
approved?
i
mean,
you
have
to
allege
--
that
makes
some
allegations,
don't
you,
that
you
want
to
extend
and
pay
off
some
of
your
debts
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
agree,
not
always,
no,
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
agree
not
always
but
there
were
--
certainly,
there
was
a
receiver
here,
a
trustee
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
but
the
aim
was
to
rehabilitate
this
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
operate
the
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
a
suit
against
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
that's
an
easy
--
and
to
attempt
to
pass
personal
liability
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
there
are
those
the
only
two
remedies
that
you
can
think
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
chapter
xi
proceeding
had
succeeded
and
if
the
--
if
there
hadn't
been
a
petition
filed
in
ordinary
bankruptcy,
i
suppose
that
this
--
there
could
been
a
suit
against
the
debtor,
against
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
insurance
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mister,
you
--
would
you
hazard
against
us
to
what
would
happen
to
this
claim
in
a
chapter
x
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
claims
are
--
tort
claims
are
connected
with
operating
a
business
aren't
normally
cost
of
administration
of
some
kind
or
in
--
or
in
--
but
or
rather
in
railroad
reorganizations.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
thought
only
in
chapter
x.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
collier
seems
to
think
that
tort
claims
are
payable
as
a
cost
of
administration
in
chapter
x.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
and
the
--
if
they
are,
it's
because
they
are
necessary
incidence
to
the
running
of
the
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
problem
with
that,
mr.
roberts
is,
isn't
it
that
63
talks
exclusively
about
claims
against
the
bankrupt?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
nicholas
doesn't
deal
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
roberts,
what
would
you
say
if
this
had
been
a
small
fire
and
the
damage
is
$12,000
to
a
--
$10,000
to
adjoining
property
and
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
just
continued
on
and
that
--
what
would've
happened
to
that
$10,000
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it's
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
say
the
other
debts
of
the
debtor
had
been
extended
for
five
years
and
the
person
who
is
damaged,
$10,000
worth
by
the
operation
of
the
building
by
the
trustee
wants
immediate
payment.
they
say
this
is
an
expense
of
administration
which
must
be
paid
along
with
other
expenses
of
administration.
that
means
now
not
five
years
from
now.
and
the
question
is,
is
it
an
expense
of
administration
under
chapter
xi
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
never
does,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
the
arrangement's
already
been
approved
and
the
--
in
my
example,
he
filed
the
plan,
it's
being
carried
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
--
you
think
the
tort
claim
though
is
at
--
that
$10,000
tort
claim
is
recoverable
somehow
from
the
debtor
or
from
the
trustee
in
a
chapter
xi
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
the
--
well,
its
recoverable,
as
it's
recoverable
as
the
rest
of
the
debts.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
get
--
you
just
--
your
argument
is
that
it
just
doesn't
get
priority?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
provable
in
a
chapter
xi.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
it
is
provable
--
if
its
provable
in
chapter
xi
--
that
claim
is
provable
in
chapter
xi
had
there
been
no
bankruptcy?
i
don't
see
why
it
isn't
for
that
very
reason,
wholly
aside
from
63
(a)
(7)
provable
in
bankruptcy.
if
bankruptcy
ensued?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
find
any
--
put
any
significance
in
the
fact
that
this
is
chapter

straight
bankruptcy?
