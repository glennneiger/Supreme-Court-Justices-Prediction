etc.
mr.
white,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
it
be
unconstitutional
if
the
claimant
of
this
kind
was
put
to
the
bond
of
the
receiver
for
good
administration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
if
they
--
if
there's
a
bond,
they
puts
up
a
bond
to
guarantee
against
maladministration
and
why
would
it
be
unconstitutional
if
the
claimants
were
left
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
don't
know
either
but
what
if
things
of
these
magnitude
are
to
be
charged
against
the
whole
estate
so
was
to
wipeout
all
of
the
legitimate
claimants
against
the
bankrupt,
why
would
it
be
unconstitutional
to
leave
the
claimants
for
maladministration
up
to
the
bond
that's
put
up
for
good
administration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
give
them
all
the
money
and
leave
the
--
all
the
creditors
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
take
it
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
statutory
interpretation
but
i
would
ask
you
what
the
unconstitutionality
of
it
would
be
if
they
are
left
only
to
the
bond
rather
than
to
assets
of
the
estate.
you
said
it
would
be
grossly
unconstitutional
and
i'm
just
asking
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
of
the
brief
show
that
learned
hand
case
as
to
whether
that
was
argued
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
you
thought
it
must
be
--
it
must
have
been
argued
and
i
wondered
what's
your
basis
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
