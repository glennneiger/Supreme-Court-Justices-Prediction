chief
justice
earl
warren
number
20,
federal
trade
commission
petitioner
versus
flotill
products
incorporated
et
al.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
your
position
this
simple
mr.
shapiro
that
either
--
that
the
federal
trade
commission
either
must
act
by
a
full
membership
or
it
can
act
by
a
quorum,
which
would
be
a
majority
and
if
it
can
act
by
a
quorum,
it
can
act
by
a
majority
of
the
quorum?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question?
is
there
any
other
federal
agency
that
under
statute
like
the
federal
trade
commission
acts
as
you
suggest,
they
should
be
entitled
to
act
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
mr.
shapiro
name
some
other
agencies
that
were
set
up
in
a
different
way?
didn't
he
say
that
the
rule
was
just
the
opposite
so
far
as
congress
congressional
acts
that
was
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
the
practical
difference
in
the
result
between
this
situation
and
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
courts
of
appeals
where
we
have
nine
members
in
most
power
and
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
and
they
sit
in
panels
of
three
and
majority
of
the
panels
can
give
final
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
very
seldom
gets
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
simon,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
mr.
simon?
suppose
that
back
they
were
still
only
four
members
on
the
commission,
would
the
four
members
have
a
right
to
grant
for
rehearing
or
deny
the
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
a
different
thing,
but
if
they
all
may
have
one
vacancy
at
that
time,
it
would
be
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
remember
you
said
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
when
the
reorganization
act
was
passed
in
relevance
to
your
appearing
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
of
those
cases
were
the
panel
of
three
which
unanimous
whether
appealing
to
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shapiro,
before
you
head
into
your
argument,
may
i
ask
you
this?
in
view
of
the
fact
that
congress
has
passed
this
reorganization
act
that
gives
you
the
right
to
set
up
panels,
but
with
the
right
that
reviewed
by
the
entire
commission,
why
do
you
not
accept
that
congressional
approval
of
this
saying
and
do
it
in
the
way
congress
apparently
intended
to
be
done
rather
than
the
short
circuit,
they
act
and
do
it
your
way,
that
denies
someone
a
hearing
before
the
whole
commission?
is
that
a
fair
question
to
ask?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
mr.
simon
was
saying
that
there
had
been
27
cases
that
had
gone
to
judgment
where
you
have
had
only
three
to
sit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
adopted
the
reorganization
plan
that
would
necessarily
mean
that
you
would
have
to
have
panels
of
three
always,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
still
use
it
only
when
you
wanted
to
or
where
you
needed
to,
could
not
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
why
you
would
not
want
that
flexibility,
why
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
it
mean
that
they
want
to
delegate
it
to
three
members,
but
they
do
not
want
to
take
on
the
burden
of
review
of
their
actions?
