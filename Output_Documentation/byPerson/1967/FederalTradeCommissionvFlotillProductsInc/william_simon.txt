mr.
william
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
simple
question
of
statutory
construction
and
that
is
whether
the
congress
authorized
the
federal
trade
commission
to
decide
adjudicatory
matters
with
the
concurrence
of
less
than
a
majority
of
its
members.
now
while
the
court
may
not
--
need
not
go
beyond
this
question
of
statutory
construction,
we
urge
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
administration
of
justice
for
reaching
a
different
conclusion.
the
facts
of
this
case
illustrate
the
need
for
the
rule
which
we
advocate.
in
1958,
a
complaint
was
filed
against
flotill,
charging
them
with
the
violation
of
the
brokerage
provision
of
the
robinson-patman.
this
section
makes
it
illegal
for
a
seller
to
grant
or
a
buyer
to
receive
a
discount
in
lieu
of
brokerage.
precisely
the
same
standard,
precisely
the
same
liability
is
fixed
for
the
seller
and
the
buyer.
two
issues
were
raised;
one
with
respect
to
field
brokers
and
one
with
respect
to
advertising
or
promotional
allowances
made
in
1955
to
a
single
customer,
the
nash-finch
company.
when
the
case
came
before
the
commission
for
decision,
there
were
three
separate
opinions.
no
commissioner
concurred
in
the
opinion
of
any
other
commissioner.
chairman
dickson
and
commissioner
elmon
dismissed
the
field
broker
charge,
commissioner
mcintyre
dissented.
chairman
dickson
and
commissioner
mcintyre
held
as
liable
on
the
nash-finch
payments,
commissioner
elmon
dissented.
commissioner
riley
who
was
qualified
to
act
in
every
respect
did
not
participate
and
may
i
say
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
quite
frequent
for
commissioners
who
have
not
heard
oral
argument
to
participate
in
the
decisions.
now
subsequently,
the
very
same
issue
involving
the
very
same
transaction
came
before
the
federal
trade
commission
in
a
proceeding
against
nash-finch,
who
had
received
this
illegal
brokerage.
the
same
witnesses
were
called
in
the
nash-finch
case,
the
same
documents
were
offered
in
evidence,
i
might
add
humbly
even
the
same
lawyers
represented
both
the
litigants,
but
in
the
nash-finch
case,
by
a
vote
of
four-to-nothing,
the
complaint
was
dismissed.
commissioner
mcintyre,
who
had
been
the
one
holding
guilty
all
the
time
in
the
flotill
case
did
not
participate
and
the
commission's
action
in
the
nash-finch
case
was
foretold
by
its
action
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
empire
mills
case.
the
second
circuit
had
handed
down
a
decision
which
basically
followed
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case,
in
a
case
pending
before
the
second
circuit.
on
rehearing,
the
court
of
appeals
asked
the
commission
to
file
an
amicus
curiae
brief.
the
commission
did
so
and
four
commissioners,
with
commissioner
mcintyre
dissenting,
adopted
in
that
amicus
brief
what
is
substantially
the
view
of
commissioner
elmon
in
this
case
and
therefore
commissioner
elmon's
minority
view
here
became
the
majority
view
of
the
commission
and
when
nash-finch
came
before
it
that
case
was
dismissed.
now,
i
turn
to
the
face
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
language
in
the
statute,
none
whatever
which
justifies
a
decision
by
less
than
a
majority
of
the
commissioners.
first,
congress
provided
for
this
quasi-judicial
body
of
five
members
and
it
said
that
no
two
of
their
term
should
expire
in
the
same
year.
this
was
obviously
designed
to
promote
continuity.
then
it
said,
they
could
be
removed
only
for
cause
and
in
the
humphrey's,
this
court
held
that
the
president
could
not
remove
a
commissioner
except
for
a
good
cause.
third,
the
congress
provided
that
no
more
than
three
of
the
members
of
the
commission
should
be
of
the
same
political
party,
obviously
to
achieve
a
bi-partisan
agency
and
yet
if
the
commission's
view
is
sustained
here,
the
president
can
appoint
three
members
of
his
own
party
and
let
the
other
two
vacancies
be
unfilled
permanently
and
the
three
members
of
his
party
could
constitute
the
commission
and
destroy
the
congressional
bi-partisan
purpose.
fourth
the
act
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
but
not
when
there
are
two
vacancies,
i
was
just
about
to
say
the
same
justice
stewart
but
statute
then
says
that
a
vacancy,
both
in
the
singular,
a'
and
vacancy'
in
the
singular,
shall
not
impair
the
ability
of
commission
to
act.
the
commission
today
asked
you
to
interpret
that
language
to
say
that
two
vacancies
shall
not
impair
their
ability
to
act.
and
finally,
whenever
the
congress
has
intended
that
less
than
a
majority
of
the
members
of
a
agency
be
authorized
to
act,
it
has
known
the
words
to
use
to
do
so,
both
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
the
congress
has
expressly
provided
that
the
agency
may
act
by
panels
of
three.
and
in
the
atomic
energy
commission
act
as
well
as
in
the
renegotiation
board
act,
congress
provided
for
five-man
bodies
and
then
provided
for
a
three-man
quorum
and
then
provided
that
a
majority
of
the
three-man
quorum
could
act
for
the
agency.
none
such
language
is
contained
in
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
mr.
william
simon
of
course,
he
contends
it
because
they
had
provided
for
a
quorum
provision
in
some
agencies
that
you
must
assume
they
intended
to
do
it
for
the
agencies
they
didn't.
i
draw
the
opposite
congressional
intend
sir
i
say
when
congress
did
it
here,
there
and
there,
we
must
assume
they
deliberately
did
not
intended
to
do
it
here.
mr.
shapiro
says
if
they
did
it
here,
there
and
there,
you
must
assume
they
also
intended
to
do
it
where
they
didn't
do
it.
our
argument
is
you
cannot
imply
congressional
intent
when
congress
has
not
done
it.
mr.
william
simon
the
quorum
provision
has
been
on
the
rules
mr.
justice
fortas
for
since
1950,
over
50
years
but
so
far
as
we
know
--
mr.
william
simon
50,
for
over
50
years,
but
so
far
as
we
know,
the
first
case
in
which
the
commission
ever
acted
by
two-to-one
vote
occurred
in
1963.
mr.
william
simon
not
at
all
sir.
as
mr.
shapiro
said
earlier
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
have
conceded
throughout
that
the
three-man
quorum
rule
is
wholly
valid
and
when
three
commissioners
are
unanimous
in
their
decision
it
would
be
irrelevant
what
the
other
two
did.
mr.
william
simon
what
congress
provided
for
was
a
five-man
commission;
three
of
them
may
be
republicans,
three
of
them
may
be
democrats
and
certainly
they
can
decide
cases
by
a
three-to-two
vote.
if
there
are
three
affirmative
votes
for
any
position,
the
statutory
requirement
has
been
met
and
we
do
not
question
at
all
the
right
of
the
commission
to
act
by
three-to-nothing,
three-to-one,
or
three-to-two,
so
long
as
there
are
three
votes
for
the
action
to
take.
mr.
william
simon
no
sir.
mr.
william
simon
may
i
say
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
are
three
instances
to
that.
first,
this
court
is
different
than
any
other
court,
because
it
is
a
branch
of
the
government,
independent
of
a
congress
and
the
executive,
so
there
is
a
limitation
on
even
the
rules
that
congress
can
provide
for
deliberations
by
this
court.
mr.
william
simon
well,
i
would
not
want
to
argue
the
case,
if
this
court
had
adopted
a
rule
for
a
quorum
of
five,
but
the
court
is
an
independent
branch
of
our
government.
secondly
the
validity
of
the
quorum
rule
cannot
be
confused
with
the
power
of
the
commission
to
act
by
a
vote
of
three.
for
example,
if
the
commission
had
adopted
a
quorum
rule
saying
that
two
commissioners
are
a
quorum,
i
would
be
here
urging
that
that
rule
was
invalid
or
if
they
had
said
one
commissioner
was
a
quorum,
i
would
urge
that
rule
is
invalid.
so
it
is
not
that
we
say
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
adopt
any
quorum
rule
it
chooses,
but
we
concede
in
a
five-member
body,
all
you
need
is
three
affirmative
votes
to
take
any
action
and
if
you
assume
the
other
two
votes
would
be
contrary,
it
would
still
be
a
three-to-two
decision.
mr.
william
simon
no
sir,
if
six
is
a
quorum
then
a
majority
of
the
quorum
would
be
four,
but
congress
did
not
provide
mr.
justice
brennan
for
a
quorum
of
three
of
the
commission.
mr.
shapiro
gains
comfort
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir
and
the
distinction
i
make
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
i
do
not
agree
that
the
commission
has
authority
to
establish
a
quorum
rule
of
its
own.
for
example,
i
do
not
agree
they
could
establish
a
quorum
rule
that
two
was
a
quorum
or
that
one
was
a
quorum.
mr.
william
simon
but
i
concede
mr.
justice
white
that
a
decision
by
three
members
of
the
commission
is
the
majority
of
the
whole
body.
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
but
one
may
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
before
the
full
court
of
appeals?
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
that
may
be
and
we
filed
mr.
chief
justice
a
petition
for
rehearing
here
properly
and
we
asked
in
our
petition
for
rehearing
that
commissioner
riley
who
was
a
member
of
the
commission
sit
and
we
said,
even
though
he
did
not
hear
the
argument,
we
would
like
to
have
him
sit
and
we
asked
them
to
wait
until
the
vacancy
was
filled
and
let
that
commissioner
fill
the
vacancy.
the
commission
could
have
denied
our
petition
for
rehearing
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
merit
to
it,
just
as
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
may
do
so,
but
they
denied
it
on
the
ground
that
the
two-to-one
decision
was
a
valid
binding
decision
from
which
there
was
no
recourse.
and
they
relied
on
two
cases,
which
i
think
illustrate
the
view
they
take.
the
two
cases
were
frischer
versus
bakelite,
which
involved
the
tariff
commission
and
the
drath
case,
which
involved
the
federal
trade
commission.
frischer
versus
bakelite
holds
that
governmental
bodies
like
city
council,
zoning
boards,
that
sort
of
entity
may
act
by
a
board
of
a
majority
of
a
quorum,
but
the
judicial
bodies,
bodies
exercising
judicial
functions
require
a
majority
of
the
whole.
and
in
our
brief,
we
extensively
cite
the
common
law,
which
frischer
versus
bakelite
relies
on
and
it
two
as
to
the
same
effect
that
where
judicial
functions
are
at
issue
a
majority
of
the
whole
body
is
required
unless
the
statute
creating
it
or
the
constitution
provides
otherwise.
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
did
not
reverse
this
order.
they
didn't
set
it
aside.
they
merely
sent
it
back
to
the
commission
to
have
the
full
five
members
of
the
commission
decide
what
should
be
the
decision
in
this
case.
then
i
would
like
to
talk
a
minute
if
i
may
about
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
but
of
course
if
they
granted
it
and
then
they
split
two-to-two,
they
would
have
a
problem.
mr.
william
simon
the
statute
says
in
just
so
many
words
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
vacancy
--
mr.
william
simon
--
shall
not
impair
their
ability
to
act.
to
me,
the
strongest
question
here,
the
strongest
fact
in
this
case
is
the
reorganization
act
of
1961.
the
commission
relies
heavily
on
it,
but
i
think
it
is
conclusive
against
them.
in
the
reorganization
act
of
1961,
president
kennedy
provided
in
the
act
and
congress
provided
when
it
adopted
it
that
the
federal
trade
commission
could
create
panels
of
less
than
the
full
commission
to
decide
cases.
the
commission
has
never
done
so.
congress
had
said
in
the
reorganization
act,
you
can
do
this,
if
you
pass
a
rule
or
regulation,
they
have
never
done
it.
but
it
is
equally
clear
and
they
expressly
concede
this
at
page
25
of
their
brief
that
if
they
had
done
it,
we
would
be
entitled
to
review
by
the
full
commission.
and
if
we
had
been
entitled
to
review
by
the
full
commission,
what
the
full
commission
did
in
nash-finch
would
certainly
indicate
that
our
case
would
have
been
dismissed.
now
as
i
said
earlier,
the
first
case
of
the
two-to-one
decision
was
in
1963,
at
least
the
first
case
that
either
we
or
commission
counsel
are
aware
of.
mr.
william
simon
that
is
the
other
side
of
the
same
coin
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
simon
well,
if
i
may
state
it
differently,
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
we
want
a
hearing
before
the
full
commission.
we
want
a
hearing
before
the
full
commission
and
we
asked
for
it.
mr.
william
simon
but
that
the
reorganization
act
provides
that
they
may
enact
a
rule
with
this
effect.
they
have
never
enacted
any
such
rule.
mr.
william
simon
after
the
fact,
this
suggestion
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir
but
they
never
claimed
--
mr.
william
simon
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
reorganization
act
was
never
mentioned
in
this
case
until
on
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
commission
did
not
purport
to
be
acting
under
the
reorganization
act
when
it
decided
the
case
and
when
we
petitioned
for
review,
which
we
would
have
had
the
right
to
under
the
reorganization
act,
they
denied
it
on
the
ground
that
two-to-one
decision
was
binding
and
we
had
no
right
to
go
beyond.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
first
--
mr.
william
simon
it
was
passed
in
1961
and
this
order
was
in
1964.
from
the
first
two-to-one
decision
that
we
are
aware
of,
there
have
been
30
cases
decided
by
the
commission
by
vote
of
three
members.
in
17
of
those
cases,
the
three
commissioners
were
unanimous,
there
was
no
division.
in
13
of
them,
the
vote
was
two-to-one.
of
those
13
cases,
12
of
them
were
taken
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
indicating
i
submit
that
the
businessmen
were
unwilling
to
accept
the
commission's
two-to-one
decisions.
of
the
12
cases
that
went
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
one
of
them
was
a
commission
refusal
to
review
a
prior
three-to-one
decision,
so
that
12
of
them
involved
the
problem
we
have
here.
of
those
cases,
four
of
them
are
still
pending
in
the
courts;
two
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
two
in
this
court,
this
case
and
the
pureleter
case.
there
had
been
seven
of
those
cases,
which
have
been
finally
decided
and
the
commission
was
reversed
in
six
out
of
the
seven
cases,
so
that
if
this
court
were
to
sustain
the
view
that
we
urge,
there
are
only
some
two
or
three
cases
that
would
have
to
be
reheard
by
the
commission,
virtually
all
the
rest
of
them
have
already
been
reversed
by
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
william
simon
i
cannot
answer
that
question
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
was
much
fewer
percentage
than
where
they
were
two-to-one.
it
is
in
an
appendix
to
the
commission's
brief.
i
have
not
taken
the
time
to
compile,
and
i
am
sorry
sir.
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
commission
argues
here
for
administrative
practicality.
they
say
they
would
like
to
have
five
commissioners
sit,
but
it
is
not
always
feasible
and
so
they
ask
this
court
to
substitute
convenience
for
justice.
but
the
fact
is
that
there
has
only
been
one
double
vacancy
in
the
last
45
years
and
that
occurred
more
than
30
years
ago
for
six
weeks
during
july
and
august
when
this
commission
is
not
active
in
any
event.
they
argue
that
if
only
three
commissioners
hear
that
argument,
they
can't
know
whether
they
will
be
unanimous
and
the
argument
might
turn
out
to
be
a
waste.
but
the
fact
is
that
this
is
equally
true
where
four
commissioners
hear
the
argument
because
they
might
turn
out
to
be
divided
two-to-two.
if
the
federal
trade
commission
wants
to
decide
cases
by
a
two-to-one
vote,
we
respectfully
submit
that
their
course
is
to
enact
a
rule
under
the
reorganization
act
of
1961
providing
for
such
a
practice
and
this
would
give
the
losing
litigant
the
opportunity
for
review
by
the
full
commission.
this
is
all
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
in
this
case.
this
is
all
that
flotill
asks
and
there
can
be
no
prejudice
to
the
public
interest
for
having
the
full
commission
decide
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
william
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
simple
question
of
statutory
construction
and
that
is
whether
the
congress
authorized
the
federal
trade
commission
to
decide
adjudicatory
matters
with
the
concurrence
of
less
than
a
majority
of
its
members.
now
while
the
court
may
not
--
need
not
go
beyond
this
question
of
statutory
construction,
we
urge
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
administration
of
justice
for
reaching
a
different
conclusion.
the
facts
of
this
case
illustrate
the
need
for
the
rule
which
we
advocate.
in
1958,
a
complaint
was
filed
against
flotill,
charging
them
with
the
violation
of
the
brokerage
provision
of
the
robinson-patman.
this
section
makes
it
illegal
for
a
seller
to
grant
or
a
buyer
to
receive
a
discount
in
lieu
of
brokerage.
precisely
the
same
standard,
precisely
the
same
liability
is
fixed
for
the
seller
and
the
buyer.
two
issues
were
raised;
one
with
respect
to
field
brokers
and
one
with
respect
to
advertising
or
promotional
allowances
made
in
1955
to
a
single
customer,
the
nash-finch
company.
when
the
case
came
before
the
commission
for
decision,
there
were
three
separate
opinions.
no
commissioner
concurred
in
the
opinion
of
any
other
commissioner.
chairman
dickson
and
commissioner
elmon
dismissed
the
field
broker
charge,
commissioner
mcintyre
dissented.
chairman
dickson
and
commissioner
mcintyre
held
as
liable
on
the
nash-finch
payments,
commissioner
elmon
dissented.
commissioner
riley
who
was
qualified
to
act
in
every
respect
did
not
participate
and
may
i
say
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
quite
frequent
for
commissioners
who
have
not
heard
oral
argument
to
participate
in
the
decisions.
now
subsequently,
the
very
same
issue
involving
the
very
same
transaction
came
before
the
federal
trade
commission
in
a
proceeding
against
nash-finch,
who
had
received
this
illegal
brokerage.
the
same
witnesses
were
called
in
the
nash-finch
case,
the
same
documents
were
offered
in
evidence,
i
might
add
humbly
even
the
same
lawyers
represented
both
the
litigants,
but
in
the
nash-finch
case,
by
a
vote
of
four-to-nothing,
the
complaint
was
dismissed.
commissioner
mcintyre,
who
had
been
the
one
holding
guilty
all
the
time
in
the
flotill
case
did
not
participate
and
the
commission's
action
in
the
nash-finch
case
was
foretold
by
its
action
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
empire
mills
case.
the
second
circuit
had
handed
down
a
decision
which
basically
followed
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case,
in
a
case
pending
before
the
second
circuit.
on
rehearing,
the
court
of
appeals
asked
the
commission
to
file
an
amicus
curiae
brief.
the
commission
did
so
and
four
commissioners,
with
commissioner
mcintyre
dissenting,
adopted
in
that
amicus
brief
what
is
substantially
the
view
of
commissioner
elmon
in
this
case
and
therefore
commissioner
elmon's
minority
view
here
became
the
majority
view
of
the
commission
and
when
nash-finch
came
before
it
that
case
was
dismissed.
now,
i
turn
to
the
face
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
language
in
the
statute,
none
whatever
which
justifies
a
decision
by
less
than
a
majority
of
the
commissioners.
first,
congress
provided
for
this
quasi-judicial
body
of
five
members
and
it
said
that
no
two
of
their
term
should
expire
in
the
same
year.
this
was
obviously
designed
to
promote
continuity.
then
it
said,
they
could
be
removed
only
for
cause
and
in
the
humphrey's,
this
court
held
that
the
president
could
not
remove
a
commissioner
except
for
a
good
cause.
third,
the
congress
provided
that
no
more
than
three
of
the
members
of
the
commission
should
be
of
the
same
political
party,
obviously
to
achieve
a
bi-partisan
agency
and
yet
if
the
commission's
view
is
sustained
here,
the
president
can
appoint
three
members
of
his
own
party
and
let
the
other
two
vacancies
be
unfilled
permanently
and
the
three
members
of
his
party
could
constitute
the
commission
and
destroy
the
congressional
bi-partisan
purpose.
fourth
the
act
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
but
not
when
there
are
two
vacancies,
i
was
just
about
to
say
the
same
justice
stewart
but
statute
then
says
that
a
vacancy,
both
in
the
singular,
a'
and
vacancy'
in
the
singular,
shall
not
impair
the
ability
of
commission
to
act.
the
commission
today
asked
you
to
interpret
that
language
to
say
that
two
vacancies
shall
not
impair
their
ability
to
act.
and
finally,
whenever
the
congress
has
intended
that
less
than
a
majority
of
the
members
of
a
agency
be
authorized
to
act,
it
has
known
the
words
to
use
to
do
so,
both
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
the
congress
has
expressly
provided
that
the
agency
may
act
by
panels
of
three.
and
in
the
atomic
energy
commission
act
as
well
as
in
the
renegotiation
board
act,
congress
provided
for
five-man
bodies
and
then
provided
for
a
three-man
quorum
and
then
provided
that
a
majority
of
the
three-man
quorum
could
act
for
the
agency.
none
such
language
is
contained
in
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
mr.
william
simon
of
course,
he
contends
it
because
they
had
provided
for
a
quorum
provision
in
some
agencies
that
you
must
assume
they
intended
to
do
it
for
the
agencies
they
didn't.
i
draw
the
opposite
congressional
intend
sir
i
say
when
congress
did
it
here,
there
and
there,
we
must
assume
they
deliberately
did
not
intended
to
do
it
here.
mr.
shapiro
says
if
they
did
it
here,
there
and
there,
you
must
assume
they
also
intended
to
do
it
where
they
didn't
do
it.
our
argument
is
you
cannot
imply
congressional
intent
when
congress
has
not
done
it.
mr.
william
simon
the
quorum
provision
has
been
on
the
rules
mr.
justice
fortas
for
since
1950,
over
50
years
but
so
far
as
we
know
--
mr.
william
simon
50,
for
over
50
years,
but
so
far
as
we
know,
the
first
case
in
which
the
commission
ever
acted
by
two-to-one
vote
occurred
in
1963.
mr.
william
simon
not
at
all
sir.
as
mr.
shapiro
said
earlier
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
have
conceded
throughout
that
the
three-man
quorum
rule
is
wholly
valid
and
when
three
commissioners
are
unanimous
in
their
decision
it
would
be
irrelevant
what
the
other
two
did.
mr.
william
simon
what
congress
provided
for
was
a
five-man
commission;
three
of
them
may
be
republicans,
three
of
them
may
be
democrats
and
certainly
they
can
decide
cases
by
a
three-to-two
vote.
if
there
are
three
affirmative
votes
for
any
position,
the
statutory
requirement
has
been
met
and
we
do
not
question
at
all
the
right
of
the
commission
to
act
by
three-to-nothing,
three-to-one,
or
three-to-two,
so
long
as
there
are
three
votes
for
the
action
to
take.
mr.
william
simon
no
sir.
mr.
william
simon
may
i
say
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
are
three
instances
to
that.
first,
this
court
is
different
than
any
other
court,
because
it
is
a
branch
of
the
government,
independent
of
a
congress
and
the
executive,
so
there
is
a
limitation
on
even
the
rules
that
congress
can
provide
for
deliberations
by
this
court.
mr.
william
simon
well,
i
would
not
want
to
argue
the
case,
if
this
court
had
adopted
a
rule
for
a
quorum
of
five,
but
the
court
is
an
independent
branch
of
our
government.
secondly
the
validity
of
the
quorum
rule
cannot
be
confused
with
the
power
of
the
commission
to
act
by
a
vote
of
three.
for
example,
if
the
commission
had
adopted
a
quorum
rule
saying
that
two
commissioners
are
a
quorum,
i
would
be
here
urging
that
that
rule
was
invalid
or
if
they
had
said
one
commissioner
was
a
quorum,
i
would
urge
that
rule
is
invalid.
so
it
is
not
that
we
say
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
adopt
any
quorum
rule
it
chooses,
but
we
concede
in
a
five-member
body,
all
you
need
is
three
affirmative
votes
to
take
any
action
and
if
you
assume
the
other
two
votes
would
be
contrary,
it
would
still
be
a
three-to-two
decision.
mr.
william
simon
no
sir,
if
six
is
a
quorum
then
a
majority
of
the
quorum
would
be
four,
but
congress
did
not
provide
mr.
justice
brennan
for
a
quorum
of
three
of
the
commission.
mr.
shapiro
gains
comfort
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir
and
the
distinction
i
make
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
i
do
not
agree
that
the
commission
has
authority
to
establish
a
quorum
rule
of
its
own.
for
example,
i
do
not
agree
they
could
establish
a
quorum
rule
that
two
was
a
quorum
or
that
one
was
a
quorum.
mr.
william
simon
but
i
concede
mr.
justice
white
that
a
decision
by
three
members
of
the
commission
is
the
majority
of
the
whole
body.
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
but
one
may
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
before
the
full
court
of
appeals?
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
that
may
be
and
we
filed
mr.
chief
justice
a
petition
for
rehearing
here
properly
and
we
asked
in
our
petition
for
rehearing
that
commissioner
riley
who
was
a
member
of
the
commission
sit
and
we
said,
even
though
he
did
not
hear
the
argument,
we
would
like
to
have
him
sit
and
we
asked
them
to
wait
until
the
vacancy
was
filled
and
let
that
commissioner
fill
the
vacancy.
the
commission
could
have
denied
our
petition
for
rehearing
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
merit
to
it,
just
as
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
may
do
so,
but
they
denied
it
on
the
ground
that
the
two-to-one
decision
was
a
valid
binding
decision
from
which
there
was
no
recourse.
and
they
relied
on
two
cases,
which
i
think
illustrate
the
view
they
take.
the
two
cases
were
frischer
versus
bakelite,
which
involved
the
tariff
commission
and
the
drath
case,
which
involved
the
federal
trade
commission.
frischer
versus
bakelite
holds
that
governmental
bodies
like
city
council,
zoning
boards,
that
sort
of
entity
may
act
by
a
board
of
a
majority
of
a
quorum,
but
the
judicial
bodies,
bodies
exercising
judicial
functions
require
a
majority
of
the
whole.
and
in
our
brief,
we
extensively
cite
the
common
law,
which
frischer
versus
bakelite
relies
on
and
it
two
as
to
the
same
effect
that
where
judicial
functions
are
at
issue
a
majority
of
the
whole
body
is
required
unless
the
statute
creating
it
or
the
constitution
provides
otherwise.
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
did
not
reverse
this
order.
they
didn't
set
it
aside.
they
merely
sent
it
back
to
the
commission
to
have
the
full
five
members
of
the
commission
decide
what
should
be
the
decision
in
this
case.
then
i
would
like
to
talk
a
minute
if
i
may
about
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
but
of
course
if
they
granted
it
and
then
they
split
two-to-two,
they
would
have
a
problem.
mr.
william
simon
the
statute
says
in
just
so
many
words
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
vacancy
--
mr.
william
simon
--
shall
not
impair
their
ability
to
act.
to
me,
the
strongest
question
here,
the
strongest
fact
in
this
case
is
the
reorganization
act
of
1961.
the
commission
relies
heavily
on
it,
but
i
think
it
is
conclusive
against
them.
in
the
reorganization
act
of
1961,
president
kennedy
provided
in
the
act
and
congress
provided
when
it
adopted
it
that
the
federal
trade
commission
could
create
panels
of
less
than
the
full
commission
to
decide
cases.
the
commission
has
never
done
so.
congress
had
said
in
the
reorganization
act,
you
can
do
this,
if
you
pass
a
rule
or
regulation,
they
have
never
done
it.
but
it
is
equally
clear
and
they
expressly
concede
this
at
page
25
of
their
brief
that
if
they
had
done
it,
we
would
be
entitled
to
review
by
the
full
commission.
and
if
we
had
been
entitled
to
review
by
the
full
commission,
what
the
full
commission
did
in
nash-finch
would
certainly
indicate
that
our
case
would
have
been
dismissed.
now
as
i
said
earlier,
the
first
case
of
the
two-to-one
decision
was
in
1963,
at
least
the
first
case
that
either
we
or
commission
counsel
are
aware
of.
mr.
william
simon
that
is
the
other
side
of
the
same
coin
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
simon
well,
if
i
may
state
it
differently,
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
we
want
a
hearing
before
the
full
commission.
we
want
a
hearing
before
the
full
commission
and
we
asked
for
it.
mr.
william
simon
but
that
the
reorganization
act
provides
that
they
may
enact
a
rule
with
this
effect.
they
have
never
enacted
any
such
rule.
mr.
william
simon
after
the
fact,
this
suggestion
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir
but
they
never
claimed
--
mr.
william
simon
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
reorganization
act
was
never
mentioned
in
this
case
until
on
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
commission
did
not
purport
to
be
acting
under
the
reorganization
act
when
it
decided
the
case
and
when
we
petitioned
for
review,
which
we
would
have
had
the
right
to
under
the
reorganization
act,
they
denied
it
on
the
ground
that
two-to-one
decision
was
binding
and
we
had
no
right
to
go
beyond.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
first
--
mr.
william
simon
it
was
passed
in
1961
and
this
order
was
in
1964.
from
the
first
two-to-one
decision
that
we
are
aware
of,
there
have
been
30
cases
decided
by
the
commission
by
vote
of
three
members.
in
17
of
those
cases,
the
three
commissioners
were
unanimous,
there
was
no
division.
in
13
of
them,
the
vote
was
two-to-one.
of
those
13
cases,
12
of
them
were
taken
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
indicating
i
submit
that
the
businessmen
were
unwilling
to
accept
the
commission's
two-to-one
decisions.
of
the
12
cases
that
went
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
one
of
them
was
a
commission
refusal
to
review
a
prior
three-to-one
decision,
so
that
12
of
them
involved
the
problem
we
have
here.
of
those
cases,
four
of
them
are
still
pending
in
the
courts;
two
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
two
in
this
court,
this
case
and
the
pureleter
case.
there
had
been
seven
of
those
cases,
which
have
been
finally
decided
and
the
commission
was
reversed
in
six
out
of
the
seven
cases,
so
that
if
this
court
were
to
sustain
the
view
that
we
urge,
there
are
only
some
two
or
three
cases
that
would
have
to
be
reheard
by
the
commission,
virtually
all
the
rest
of
them
have
already
been
reversed
by
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
william
simon
i
cannot
answer
that
question
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
was
much
fewer
percentage
than
where
they
were
two-to-one.
it
is
in
an
appendix
to
the
commission's
brief.
i
have
not
taken
the
time
to
compile,
and
i
am
sorry
sir.
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
commission
argues
here
for
administrative
practicality.
they
say
they
would
like
to
have
five
commissioners
sit,
but
it
is
not
always
feasible
and
so
they
ask
this
court
to
substitute
convenience
for
justice.
but
the
fact
is
that
there
has
only
been
one
double
vacancy
in
the
last
45
years
and
that
occurred
more
than
30
years
ago
for
six
weeks
during
july
and
august
when
this
commission
is
not
active
in
any
event.
they
argue
that
if
only
three
commissioners
hear
that
argument,
they
can't
know
whether
they
will
be
unanimous
and
the
argument
might
turn
out
to
be
a
waste.
but
the
fact
is
that
this
is
equally
true
where
four
commissioners
hear
the
argument
because
they
might
turn
out
to
be
divided
two-to-two.
if
the
federal
trade
commission
wants
to
decide
cases
by
a
two-to-one
vote,
we
respectfully
submit
that
their
course
is
to
enact
a
rule
under
the
reorganization
act
of
1961
providing
for
such
a
practice
and
this
would
give
the
losing
litigant
the
opportunity
for
review
by
the
full
commission.
this
is
all
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
in
this
case.
this
is
all
that
flotill
asks
and
there
can
be
no
prejudice
to
the
public
interest
for
having
the
full
commission
decide
this
case.
thank
you.
