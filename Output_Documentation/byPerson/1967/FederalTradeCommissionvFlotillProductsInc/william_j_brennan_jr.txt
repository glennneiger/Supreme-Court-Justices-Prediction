justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
this
suggests
that
[inaudible]
this
is
a
decision
that
reaches
far
beyond
this
federal
trade
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example,
as
you
know,
there
is
a
provision
that
permits
this
court
to
sit
in
quorum
of
six.
we
have
had
decisions
where
six
of
us
sat
down,
that
were
four-to-two.
now,
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
we
have
no
authority
to
run
through
a
four-to-two
decision
by
reason
of
anything
you
have
said
in
the
opinion
of
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
simon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
seems
mr.
simon
that
is
that
you
do
not
make
it
requisite
that
the
statutory
authority
for
a
three
member
quorum,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
long
as
they
well
now
if
it's
immaterial
then
i
put
the
question
to
you
i
put
to
mr.
shapiro.
the
statutory
authority
for
this
court
to
sit
with
quorum
of
six,
but
nothing
was
ever
said
about
that
a
majority,
there
is
nothing
in
our
statute,
which
says
that
the
majority
of
the
six
may
decide
for
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
perhaps
congress
could
not
even
have
said
our
quorum
shall
be
six
and
we
might
think
that
a
quorum
of
five
would
do
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
like
to
suggest
the
logic
of
that
seems
to
be
that
any
decision
by
which
by
a
quorum
of
this
court
is
six
would
require
five
votes,
then
to
decision
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
i
do
not
follow,
congress
had
first
time
provided
and
i
thought
that
was
going
to
be
the
distinction,
you
just
answer
mr.
justice
fortas
that
you
are
not
quarreling
with
the
quorum
of
three
rule
as
such,
it
is
only
the
decision
of
a
majority
of
the
quorum
that
you
challenge?
