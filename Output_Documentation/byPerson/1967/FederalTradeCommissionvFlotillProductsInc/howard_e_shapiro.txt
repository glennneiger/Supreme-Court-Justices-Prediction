mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
majority
of
a
quorum
of
the
federal
trade
commission
may
issue
a
valid
cease-and-desist
order
under
section
1
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
the
commission
is
composed
of
five
commissioners.
since
its
inception,
its
rules
have
provided
that
a
majority
of
the
commission
that
is
three
commissioners
constitute
a
quorum
for
the
transaction
of
business.
a
three-judge
division
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
a
three-member
quorum
could
not
act
when
divided
two-to-one.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
was
divided
two-to-one
and
the
commission
petitioned
for
rehearing
en
banc.
the
court
of
appeals
adhered
to
its
ruling
that
a
single
dissent
would
bar
valid
action.
it
divided
itself
on
this
issue
five-to-four.
the
commission
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
because
it
believes
that
the
ruling
below
will
severely
impair
its
ability
to
function
when
only
three
of
its
five
members
are
available
to
participate
in
a
decision.
now,
an
order
issued
by
divided
two-to-one
quorum
of
the
commission
is
an
order
issued
by
a
minority
of
the
total
number
of
commissioners
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
taking
note
of
this
concluded
that
this
is
not
what
congress
had
intended.
it
relied
on
two
factors.
first,
the
statute
makes
no
express
provision
for
action
by
a
three
member
quorum
and
second,
the
commission
must
have
a
politically
balanced
makeup,
at
least
the
statute
says
that
not
more
than
three
of
the
five
commissioners
shall
be
members
of
the
same
political
party.
so
in
effect,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
commission
could
act
by
a
three-member
quorum,
but
the
three
member
quorum
would
have
to
be
unanimous.
a
dissent
by
the
three
member
quorum
would
constitute
a
veto.
the
commission
proceeding
involved
charges
that
the
respondent
flotill
products,
a
west
coast
canner
and
food
processor
made
payments
in
lieu
of
brokerage,
illegal
under
section
2(c)
and
payments
of
promotional
allowances
illegal
under
section
2(d)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
there
were
cross
appeals
from
a
hearing
examiner?s
decision
by
the
respondent
and
by
the
commission?s
complaint
counsel
and
these
cross
appeals
were
argued
to
a
full
five
member
panel
of
the
commission.
but
while
the
case
was
under
submission,
two
of
the
commissioners
resigned,
leaving
only
three
commissioners
who
had
heard
the
oral
argument
sitting.
a
fourth
commissioner
was
appointed
prior
to
the
decision
by
the
commission,
but
he
declined
to
participate
on
the
ground
that
he
had
not
heard
oral
argument.
the
three
remaining
commissioners
were
chairman
dickson,
commissioner
mcintyre,
and
commissioner
elmon.
they
agreed
with
commissioner
elmon
concurring
in
the
result
that
the
charges
of
illegal
promotional
allowances
had
been
established.
now
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
enforced
this
part
of
the
order,
so
that
aspect
of
the
case
if
out.
when
it
did
that,
it
also
of
course
recognized
that
the
commission
may
act
by
a
valid
three-member
quorum.
now
the
commissioners
disagreed
as
to
the
illegal
brokerage
charges.
there
were
three
elements
in
this
charge
of
illegal
brokerage.
as
to
one
of
them,
all
three
commissioners
were
agreed
that
the
charge
should
be
dismissed
and
they
dismissed
that
aspect
of
the
charge
on
the
merits.
as
to
a
second,
commissioner
dickson
and
commissioner
elmon
were
agreed
that
they
should
be
dismissed,
but
commissioner
mcintyre
dissented,
so
those
aspects
of
the
charges
were
dismissed.
now,
the
third
aspect
of
these
brokerage
charges
involved
the
respondent
flotill
and
they
concerned
some
charges,
some
illegal
brokerage
it
was
alleged,
paid
to
the
nash-finch
company.
commissioners
dickson
and
mcintyre
agreed
that
the
nash-finch
charges
had
been
sustained,
and
commissioner
elmon
dissented.
so
what
we
had
was
a
situation
in
which
one
of
the
illegal
brokerage
charges
was
unanimously
dismissed
by
the
three
member
panel.
one
was
dismissed
two-to-one
and
the
nash-finch
charges
were
sustained
two-to-one.
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
portion
of
the
order
relating
to
the
payments
in
lieu
of
brokerage
to
nash-finch
and
that
is
the
issue
that's
before
this
court.
and
the
practical
question
is
what
the
commission
is
to
do
when
there
are
only
three
commissioners
who
can
participate
in
a
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondent
here
concede
that
the
commission
may
consider
a
case
when
only
three
members
participate.
indeed
the
respondent
at
page
18
of
its
brief
says
that
the
problem
that
we
have
here
does
not
arise
from
the
commission's
three
commissioner
quorum
or
which
it
had
since
1916,
rather
what
respondent
objects
to
is
to
the
corollary
to
that
rule
and
the
corollary
is
of
course
that
when
a
deliberative
body
is
permitted
to
act
by
a
quorum
consisting
of
less
than
its
total
membership,
the
decision
of
a
majority
of
that
quorum
is
dispositive.
as
applied
to
administrative
agencies,
we
think
that
this
rule
has
been
expressed
in
holding
or
dictum
many
times.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
as
applied
to
administrative
agencies
your
honor.
we
think
the
general
rule
that
majority
of
a
quorum
may
take
valid
dispositive
action
has
been
sustained
either
in
holding
or
recognized
in
dictum
many
times
by
the
lower
courts
and
this
appears
to
be
the
only
decision
to
the
contrary
by
a
federal
court.
now,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
quorum
rule
and
its
corollary
that
a
majority
of
a
quorum
control
is
regarded
by
the
commission
as
a
rule
of
necessarily
not
a
rule
of
preferred
practice.
there
are
situations
in
which
five
commissioners
are
not
available
to
participate
in
a
decision.
they
can
cease
to
occur
on
the
commission
as
they
did
here,
a
commissioner
may
be
ill;
a
commissioner
may
be
disqualified
as
this
happened
in
a
number
of
recent
cases
and
when
that
happens,
then
a
quorum
which
consists
of
a
bare
majority
may
be
all
that
is
available
to
act.
well,
that
is
the
justification
really
for
the
rule
which
the
commission
has
adopted.
now
?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
the
commission
always
sits
with
five
members
if
they
are
available
except
when
it
uses
its
powers
under
reorganization
plan
number
4
of
1961.
it
has
delegated
some
of
its
powers
to
a
single
commissioner
to
dispose
of
motions
and
requests
and
interlocutory
appeals
from
hearing
examiner.
the
single
commissioner's
action
however
is
reviewable
by
the
full
commission
on
a
vote
by
a
minority
of
the
commission
to
take
up
the
single
commissioner's
action.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
would
be
your
honor,
although
i
must
state
that
the
commission
has
not
purported
to
use
that
power
in
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
believe
that
it
would
ordinarily
be
three
if
the
commission
were
to
use
the
power
to
delegate
to
a
panel.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
would
be
subject
to
review.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
it
is
correct
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
the
minimum
majority
which
constitutes
a
quorum
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
commission
would
not
need
specific
authority.
now,
they
might
want
to
sit
in
a
smaller
division
than
three,
they
might
want
to
sit
as
two.
it's
conceivable
as
they
have,
they
might
want
to
grant
fuller
power
to
a
single
commissioner,
but
of
course
all
these
would
be
subjected
to
the
powers
under
the
reorganization
plan.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
the
court
had
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
would
be
a
difference
because
in
the
situation
under
the
reorganization
plan,
of
course
the
action
by
the
panel
would
be
subject
to
review
by
the
full
commission,
provided
of
course
there
was
a
qualified
full
commission
to
sit.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
the
plans
will
provide
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
it
is
correct
your
honor.
in
other
word,
eligible
i
should
explain
refers
to
the
commissioners
who
heard
the
oral
argument,
who
were
still
sitting
on
the
commission.
commissioner
riley
was
appointed
during
the
interim
between
the
time
the
case
was
argued
and
the
time
the
case
was
decided.
since
he
had
not
heard
oral
argument,
he
decided
that
he
should
not
participate
in
the
decision.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
it
is
a
very
usual
practice
your
honor.
now,
what
we
have
got
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondent
say
the
commission
can
sit
when
it
has
to
with
just
three
members,
but
those
three
members
have
to
be
unanimous.
now
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
ordinary
rule
applicable
to
the
liberty
of
bodies.
in
most
instances,
congress
has
expressly
provided
by
statute
that
a
majority
of
the
deliberative
body
constitutes
a
quorum
and
the
corollary
to
the
rule
follows
automatically
that
a
majority
of
a
quorum
can
take
dispositive
action.
now,
when
congress
has
intended
to
depart
from
the
ordinary
rule,
it
has
done
so
expressly.
it
made
expressed
provision
in
the
court
of
claims
for
example,
when
that
was
a
five
member
court
that
three
members
of
that
court
would
have
to
concur
in
a
decision
for
a
valid
decision
to
issue.
it
made
a
similar
provision
in
1909
for
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
both
of
these
are
courts
where
statutes
adopted
prior
to
the
federal
trade
commission
act
of
1940
and
a
similar
provision
now
appears
for
one
administrative
agency
only,
the
federal
maritime
commission,
which
also
must
as
a
result
of
a
1961
reorganization
plan,
make
its
decisions
with
the
concurrence
of
three
members.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
full
scope
of
the
decision
isn't
completely
clear
to
me
your
honor,
because
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
say
that
where
there
is
a
provision
in
the
statute
which
says
that
the
agency
may
act
by
a
quorum
consisting
of
a
majority,
then
it
would
be
as
a
corollary
of
that
alright
for
a
majority
of
the
quorum
to
take
dispositive
action,
but
the
federal
trade
commission
statute
as
i
said
earlier
has
no
express
provision
for
a
majority
of
the
quorum.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
your
honor,
we
would
not.
i
think
the
respondent
would
explain
that
you
have
an
express
statute
and
that
makes
the
difference
between
this
court
and
the
federal
trade
commission
which
had
no
express
statute.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
it
does,
subject
to
review
by
the
full
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
it
can
sit
in
panels
under
the
reorganization
plan.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
essence
of
the
commission
provision.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
it
is
your
honor
and
we
think
this
is
a
perfectly
practical
sensible
rule.
it
applies
to
every
other
administrative
agency.
now,
there
are
some
justifications
were
given
for
the
result
that
was
reached
by
the
court.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
like
the
federal
trade
commission
does
not
have
any
statute
and
express
provision
stating
that
a
majority
shall
constitute
a
quorum.
nevertheless,
the
commission
since
its
beginning
days,
some
two
years
after
it
was
organized
has
held
that
it
can
act
by
a
quorum
consisting
of
majority
of
its
five
member
membership
and
that
a
majority
of
the
quorum
it
can
take
dispositive
action.
now
the
sec
statute
actually
is
a
good
illustration
of
congress'
recognition
of
the
propriety
of
this
course
of
conduct
the
ftc
has
followed
since
it
was
created.
the
original
securities
exchange
act
of
1933
was
to
have
been
administered
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
and
in
1934,
congress
set
up
an
independent
agency
and
transferred
those
functions
to
the
new
securities
and
exchange
commission.
well,
that
provided
in
the
statute
that
the
new
commission
was
to
begin
its
functions
as
soon
as
a
majority
of
the
commissioners
were
qualified,
so
that
it
apparently
contemplated
that
as
soon
as
there
were
three
commissioners
on
the
five
member
sec,
they
could
take
action
by
majority
of
a
quorum.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
one
of
the
justifications
for
its
rule
was
that
the
commission
is
a
politically
balanced
agency
that
is
that
not
more
than
three
members
of
the
commission
may
be
of
the
same
political
party,
but
this
is
true
for
all
of
the
great
regulatory
agencies
and
they
all
have
the
same
general
approach
to
this
question
of
quorum.
they
have
a
provision
that
permits
them
to
act
by
a
majority
of
quorum.
i
think
a
second
answer
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
is
that
the
regulatory
commissions
are
not
supposed
to
be
voting
according
to
partisan
viewpoint.
they
perform
quasi-legislative
and
quasi-judicial
functions.
and
as
the
court,
this
court
said
in
humphrey's
executor,
the
commission
is
to
be
non-partisan
and
the
members
of
the
commission
and
the
very
nature
of
their
duties
have
to
act
with
impartiality.
for
this
reason,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
emphasis
on
the
political
makeup
of
the
commission
is
somewhat
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
has
happened
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
points
up
the
exact
situation,
certainly
the
issues
that
come
before
the
federal
trade
commission,
don't
follow
partisan
line.
even
if
some
tiny
weight
were
given
to
this
political
balance
element,
i
suggest
the
unanimity
rule
is
more
disruptive
than
the
two-to-one
rule,
because
with
the
unanimity
rule,
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
thus
as
to
give
to
the
dissenting
member
a
veto
over
valid
action
by
the
commission,
which
he
wouldn't
have
in
the
full
commission.
if
two
members
of
the
commission
dissent,
the
decision
goes
into
effect
nonetheless.
here
is
a
situation
where
one
member
dissents,
no
action
can
be
taken
at
all
and
then
there
is
some
practical
considerations
that
come
with
this.
the
commission
can't
know
in
advance
of
course
when
two
members
are
disqualified
and
three
members
are
sitting
whether
the
three
will
agree,
so
this
would
mean
that
the
cases
have
to
be
reheard
and
if
a
valid
or
qualified
--
another
qualified
member
couldn't
be
found
to
break
the
deadlock
there
might
be
no
valid
action
at
all.
now,
the
respondent
argues
that
the
case,
the
commission
should
act
by
an
absolute
majority
for
a
judicial
body.
i
think
the
short
answer
to
that
is
it
is
not.
it
is
a
quasi-judicial
and
quasi-legislative
agency.
it
does
not
have
the
attributes
or
powers
of
the
court,
it
never
has
had
them.
this
court
said
as
much
in
federal
trade
commission
against
the
eastman
kodak
many
years
ago.
there
are
some
other
practical
considerations
that
are
advanced
in
support
of
the
rule
by
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
two-to-one
decisions
are
inherently
unstable,
because
they
may
be
overruled
later
by
the
full
commission
or
they
may
be
overturned
in
appeals
by
the
courts.
well,
this
objection
really
goes
to
an
institutional
problem
that
all
deliberative
bodies
are
faced
with,
the
close
decision.
the
principles
underlying
a
three-to-two
decision
may
be
modified
because
of
a
subsequent
change
in
the
commission's
membership
or
because
the
commissioner
has
changed
his
thinking
or
because
he
has
been
persuaded
by
dissent
and
as
far
as
the
possibility
of
cases
being
changed
in
the
courts
of
appeals
are
concerned
any
decision
that
is
supported
by
a
well-reasoned
dissent
invites
resort
to
the
courts
by
the
losing
party.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
what
it
comes
down
to
is
that
two-to-one
decisions
are
invalid.
there
were
times
when
the
commission
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
act
at
all.
if
the
commission
can
act
with
a
two-to-one
decision,
there
may
be
some
disadvantages
on
occasion
because
after
all
we
are
dealing
with
the
situation
in
which
you
are
faced
with
some
imperfection
in
the
administrative
process,
because
a
full
commission
isn't
available,
but
you
have
to
balance
the
consequences
of
permitting
a
veto
on
the
one
hand
against
the
effective
performance
of
the
commission's
duty
on
the
other.
now
in
the
absence
of
some
of
congressional
expressions
to
contrary,
i
think
that
the
general
rule
that
ordinarily
applies
to
deliberative
bodies
applies
to
the
federal
trade
commission
just
as
it
applies
to
all
the
other
administrative
agencies.
for
these
reasons,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
erred
that
its
rule
would
simply
serve
either
to
bar
action
by
the
commission
in
some
cases
or
to
deter
the
expression
of
dissenting
views
and
that
neither
of
these
possibilities,
which
server
the
purposes
underlying
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
i
think
i
have
been
trying
to
answer
it
[laughter]
as
fairly
as
i
can.
the
reorganization
plan
when
is
intended
to
give
the
commission
more
flexibility
in
carrying
out
its
functions,
it
was
not
intended
to
correct
any
oversight
about
the
nature
of
quorums
in
the
commission.
now
the
commission
here
hasn't
purported
to
act
under
the
reorganization
plan
because
it
did
not
have
available
a
full
--
well,
because
it
has
never
felt
it
necessary
for
it
to
sit
in
panels
of
two
or
one
or
three,
simply
as
a
matter
of
general
practice.
what
it
has
done
is
to
adopt
--
is
to
adhere
to
its
rule
now
some
50
years
old
that
when
it
can't
sit
except
with
the
fair
majority,
then
it
will
go
on
and
carry
on
its
business.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
have
been
i
think
30
cases,
where
only
three
have
sat
because
of
vacancies
on
the
commission
and
disqualifications.
it
was
not
a
choice
of
the
full
commission
to
sit
with
only
three,
it
was
a
necessity
that
they
felt
they
had.
they
had
to
sit
with
three
because
they
just
were
not
the
other
members
available.
of
the
30
cases,
17
resulted
in
unanimous
decisions
by
the
three
members
and
13
they
were
dissents,
they
were
two-to-one
decisions.
the
reorganization
plan
does
not
is
not
the
basis
for
the
commission's
action
here
and
it
did
not
purport
to
act
on
reorganization
plan.
we
refer
to
it
because
it
does
indicate
that
less
than
a
full
commission
can
take
valid
action.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
don't
believe
the
full
text
is
set
out,
your
honor,
but
it
is
in
section
1(b)
i
think
of
the
reorganization
plan
and
it
provides
that
the
commission
may
delegate
its
authority
to
perform
any
of
its
function
directly
to
a
division
or
panel
or
any
employee
provided
that
if
--
i
think
it
is
provided
that
a
final
action
is
taken
disposing
of
a
case.
now,
this
is
rough
paraphrase.
the
commission
on
a
vote
of
a
minority
of
its
membership
may
call
that
final
action
up
for
review.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it's
a
discretion,
it
is
a
vote
in
the
--
in
order
to
have
it
reviewed,
it
would
take
a
vote
of
two
members
of
the
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
point.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
any
two
members
who
are
qualified
to
sit
and
that's
the
real
problem
that
you
may
have
a
case
in
which
for
some
reason,
while
you
may
have
a
case
in
which
there
are
only
four
members
available.
of
the
four,
one
of
them
may
feel
he
is
disqualified,
or
should
not
participate
for
some
reason.
if
he
does,
you
have
only
got
three
members
left
on
the
commission
who
can
then
consider
the
question
of
reviewing
what
the
panel
of
the
commission
did.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
under
the
reorganization
plan
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
would
really
be
a
question
of
straight
rehearing
by
the
three,
trying
to
decide
whether
they
should
grant
a
rehearing
in
that
discretion.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
likely
you
have
to
change
your
mind
would
be
so
much
more.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
it
would
not
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
plan,
it
was
designed
to
give
flexibility
to
the
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
partly
it's
a
matter
of
the
five
members
agreeing
as
to
how
they
want
to
delegate
their
functions
i
think.
they
have
delegated
the
functions
in
part
as
i
mentioned
to
you
for
purposes
for
interlocutory
appeals
and
the
like
but
that
is
as
far
as
they
feel
they
should
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
the
case
your
honor.
the
action
by
three
members
is
not
a
delegation,
this
is
really
just
the
quorum
rule
on
how
they
are
going
to
carry
on
their
business
when
there
are
not
enough
available.
well,
i
see,
my
time
is
up.
i
believe
that
it
arguably
could
follow
the
time
for
appealing
many
decisions
has
to
come
final.
we
are
really
concerned
with
the
impact
of
the
decision
on
the
commission's
general
operations.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
majority
of
a
quorum
of
the
federal
trade
commission
may
issue
a
valid
cease-and-desist
order
under
section
1
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
the
commission
is
composed
of
five
commissioners.
since
its
inception,
its
rules
have
provided
that
a
majority
of
the
commission
that
is
three
commissioners
constitute
a
quorum
for
the
transaction
of
business.
a
three-judge
division
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
a
three-member
quorum
could
not
act
when
divided
two-to-one.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
was
divided
two-to-one
and
the
commission
petitioned
for
rehearing
en
banc.
the
court
of
appeals
adhered
to
its
ruling
that
a
single
dissent
would
bar
valid
action.
it
divided
itself
on
this
issue
five-to-four.
the
commission
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
because
it
believes
that
the
ruling
below
will
severely
impair
its
ability
to
function
when
only
three
of
its
five
members
are
available
to
participate
in
a
decision.
now,
an
order
issued
by
divided
two-to-one
quorum
of
the
commission
is
an
order
issued
by
a
minority
of
the
total
number
of
commissioners
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
taking
note
of
this
concluded
that
this
is
not
what
congress
had
intended.
it
relied
on
two
factors.
first,
the
statute
makes
no
express
provision
for
action
by
a
three
member
quorum
and
second,
the
commission
must
have
a
politically
balanced
makeup,
at
least
the
statute
says
that
not
more
than
three
of
the
five
commissioners
shall
be
members
of
the
same
political
party.
so
in
effect,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
commission
could
act
by
a
three-member
quorum,
but
the
three
member
quorum
would
have
to
be
unanimous.
a
dissent
by
the
three
member
quorum
would
constitute
a
veto.
the
commission
proceeding
involved
charges
that
the
respondent
flotill
products,
a
west
coast
canner
and
food
processor
made
payments
in
lieu
of
brokerage,
illegal
under
section
2(c)
and
payments
of
promotional
allowances
illegal
under
section
2(d)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
there
were
cross
appeals
from
a
hearing
examiner?s
decision
by
the
respondent
and
by
the
commission?s
complaint
counsel
and
these
cross
appeals
were
argued
to
a
full
five
member
panel
of
the
commission.
but
while
the
case
was
under
submission,
two
of
the
commissioners
resigned,
leaving
only
three
commissioners
who
had
heard
the
oral
argument
sitting.
a
fourth
commissioner
was
appointed
prior
to
the
decision
by
the
commission,
but
he
declined
to
participate
on
the
ground
that
he
had
not
heard
oral
argument.
the
three
remaining
commissioners
were
chairman
dickson,
commissioner
mcintyre,
and
commissioner
elmon.
they
agreed
with
commissioner
elmon
concurring
in
the
result
that
the
charges
of
illegal
promotional
allowances
had
been
established.
now
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
enforced
this
part
of
the
order,
so
that
aspect
of
the
case
if
out.
when
it
did
that,
it
also
of
course
recognized
that
the
commission
may
act
by
a
valid
three-member
quorum.
now
the
commissioners
disagreed
as
to
the
illegal
brokerage
charges.
there
were
three
elements
in
this
charge
of
illegal
brokerage.
as
to
one
of
them,
all
three
commissioners
were
agreed
that
the
charge
should
be
dismissed
and
they
dismissed
that
aspect
of
the
charge
on
the
merits.
as
to
a
second,
commissioner
dickson
and
commissioner
elmon
were
agreed
that
they
should
be
dismissed,
but
commissioner
mcintyre
dissented,
so
those
aspects
of
the
charges
were
dismissed.
now,
the
third
aspect
of
these
brokerage
charges
involved
the
respondent
flotill
and
they
concerned
some
charges,
some
illegal
brokerage
it
was
alleged,
paid
to
the
nash-finch
company.
commissioners
dickson
and
mcintyre
agreed
that
the
nash-finch
charges
had
been
sustained,
and
commissioner
elmon
dissented.
so
what
we
had
was
a
situation
in
which
one
of
the
illegal
brokerage
charges
was
unanimously
dismissed
by
the
three
member
panel.
one
was
dismissed
two-to-one
and
the
nash-finch
charges
were
sustained
two-to-one.
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
portion
of
the
order
relating
to
the
payments
in
lieu
of
brokerage
to
nash-finch
and
that
is
the
issue
that's
before
this
court.
and
the
practical
question
is
what
the
commission
is
to
do
when
there
are
only
three
commissioners
who
can
participate
in
a
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondent
here
concede
that
the
commission
may
consider
a
case
when
only
three
members
participate.
indeed
the
respondent
at
page
18
of
its
brief
says
that
the
problem
that
we
have
here
does
not
arise
from
the
commission's
three
commissioner
quorum
or
which
it
had
since
1916,
rather
what
respondent
objects
to
is
to
the
corollary
to
that
rule
and
the
corollary
is
of
course
that
when
a
deliberative
body
is
permitted
to
act
by
a
quorum
consisting
of
less
than
its
total
membership,
the
decision
of
a
majority
of
that
quorum
is
dispositive.
as
applied
to
administrative
agencies,
we
think
that
this
rule
has
been
expressed
in
holding
or
dictum
many
times.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
as
applied
to
administrative
agencies
your
honor.
we
think
the
general
rule
that
majority
of
a
quorum
may
take
valid
dispositive
action
has
been
sustained
either
in
holding
or
recognized
in
dictum
many
times
by
the
lower
courts
and
this
appears
to
be
the
only
decision
to
the
contrary
by
a
federal
court.
now,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
quorum
rule
and
its
corollary
that
a
majority
of
a
quorum
control
is
regarded
by
the
commission
as
a
rule
of
necessarily
not
a
rule
of
preferred
practice.
there
are
situations
in
which
five
commissioners
are
not
available
to
participate
in
a
decision.
they
can
cease
to
occur
on
the
commission
as
they
did
here,
a
commissioner
may
be
ill;
a
commissioner
may
be
disqualified
as
this
happened
in
a
number
of
recent
cases
and
when
that
happens,
then
a
quorum
which
consists
of
a
bare
majority
may
be
all
that
is
available
to
act.
well,
that
is
the
justification
really
for
the
rule
which
the
commission
has
adopted.
now
?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
the
commission
always
sits
with
five
members
if
they
are
available
except
when
it
uses
its
powers
under
reorganization
plan
number
4
of
1961.
it
has
delegated
some
of
its
powers
to
a
single
commissioner
to
dispose
of
motions
and
requests
and
interlocutory
appeals
from
hearing
examiner.
the
single
commissioner's
action
however
is
reviewable
by
the
full
commission
on
a
vote
by
a
minority
of
the
commission
to
take
up
the
single
commissioner's
action.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
would
be
your
honor,
although
i
must
state
that
the
commission
has
not
purported
to
use
that
power
in
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
believe
that
it
would
ordinarily
be
three
if
the
commission
were
to
use
the
power
to
delegate
to
a
panel.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
would
be
subject
to
review.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
it
is
correct
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
the
minimum
majority
which
constitutes
a
quorum
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
commission
would
not
need
specific
authority.
now,
they
might
want
to
sit
in
a
smaller
division
than
three,
they
might
want
to
sit
as
two.
it's
conceivable
as
they
have,
they
might
want
to
grant
fuller
power
to
a
single
commissioner,
but
of
course
all
these
would
be
subjected
to
the
powers
under
the
reorganization
plan.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
the
court
had
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
would
be
a
difference
because
in
the
situation
under
the
reorganization
plan,
of
course
the
action
by
the
panel
would
be
subject
to
review
by
the
full
commission,
provided
of
course
there
was
a
qualified
full
commission
to
sit.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
the
plans
will
provide
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
it
is
correct
your
honor.
in
other
word,
eligible
i
should
explain
refers
to
the
commissioners
who
heard
the
oral
argument,
who
were
still
sitting
on
the
commission.
commissioner
riley
was
appointed
during
the
interim
between
the
time
the
case
was
argued
and
the
time
the
case
was
decided.
since
he
had
not
heard
oral
argument,
he
decided
that
he
should
not
participate
in
the
decision.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
it
is
a
very
usual
practice
your
honor.
now,
what
we
have
got
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondent
say
the
commission
can
sit
when
it
has
to
with
just
three
members,
but
those
three
members
have
to
be
unanimous.
now
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
ordinary
rule
applicable
to
the
liberty
of
bodies.
in
most
instances,
congress
has
expressly
provided
by
statute
that
a
majority
of
the
deliberative
body
constitutes
a
quorum
and
the
corollary
to
the
rule
follows
automatically
that
a
majority
of
a
quorum
can
take
dispositive
action.
now,
when
congress
has
intended
to
depart
from
the
ordinary
rule,
it
has
done
so
expressly.
it
made
expressed
provision
in
the
court
of
claims
for
example,
when
that
was
a
five
member
court
that
three
members
of
that
court
would
have
to
concur
in
a
decision
for
a
valid
decision
to
issue.
it
made
a
similar
provision
in
1909
for
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
both
of
these
are
courts
where
statutes
adopted
prior
to
the
federal
trade
commission
act
of
1940
and
a
similar
provision
now
appears
for
one
administrative
agency
only,
the
federal
maritime
commission,
which
also
must
as
a
result
of
a
1961
reorganization
plan,
make
its
decisions
with
the
concurrence
of
three
members.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
full
scope
of
the
decision
isn't
completely
clear
to
me
your
honor,
because
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
say
that
where
there
is
a
provision
in
the
statute
which
says
that
the
agency
may
act
by
a
quorum
consisting
of
a
majority,
then
it
would
be
as
a
corollary
of
that
alright
for
a
majority
of
the
quorum
to
take
dispositive
action,
but
the
federal
trade
commission
statute
as
i
said
earlier
has
no
express
provision
for
a
majority
of
the
quorum.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
your
honor,
we
would
not.
i
think
the
respondent
would
explain
that
you
have
an
express
statute
and
that
makes
the
difference
between
this
court
and
the
federal
trade
commission
which
had
no
express
statute.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
it
does,
subject
to
review
by
the
full
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
it
can
sit
in
panels
under
the
reorganization
plan.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
essence
of
the
commission
provision.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
it
is
your
honor
and
we
think
this
is
a
perfectly
practical
sensible
rule.
it
applies
to
every
other
administrative
agency.
now,
there
are
some
justifications
were
given
for
the
result
that
was
reached
by
the
court.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
like
the
federal
trade
commission
does
not
have
any
statute
and
express
provision
stating
that
a
majority
shall
constitute
a
quorum.
nevertheless,
the
commission
since
its
beginning
days,
some
two
years
after
it
was
organized
has
held
that
it
can
act
by
a
quorum
consisting
of
majority
of
its
five
member
membership
and
that
a
majority
of
the
quorum
it
can
take
dispositive
action.
now
the
sec
statute
actually
is
a
good
illustration
of
congress'
recognition
of
the
propriety
of
this
course
of
conduct
the
ftc
has
followed
since
it
was
created.
the
original
securities
exchange
act
of
1933
was
to
have
been
administered
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
and
in
1934,
congress
set
up
an
independent
agency
and
transferred
those
functions
to
the
new
securities
and
exchange
commission.
well,
that
provided
in
the
statute
that
the
new
commission
was
to
begin
its
functions
as
soon
as
a
majority
of
the
commissioners
were
qualified,
so
that
it
apparently
contemplated
that
as
soon
as
there
were
three
commissioners
on
the
five
member
sec,
they
could
take
action
by
majority
of
a
quorum.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
one
of
the
justifications
for
its
rule
was
that
the
commission
is
a
politically
balanced
agency
that
is
that
not
more
than
three
members
of
the
commission
may
be
of
the
same
political
party,
but
this
is
true
for
all
of
the
great
regulatory
agencies
and
they
all
have
the
same
general
approach
to
this
question
of
quorum.
they
have
a
provision
that
permits
them
to
act
by
a
majority
of
quorum.
i
think
a
second
answer
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
is
that
the
regulatory
commissions
are
not
supposed
to
be
voting
according
to
partisan
viewpoint.
they
perform
quasi-legislative
and
quasi-judicial
functions.
and
as
the
court,
this
court
said
in
humphrey's
executor,
the
commission
is
to
be
non-partisan
and
the
members
of
the
commission
and
the
very
nature
of
their
duties
have
to
act
with
impartiality.
for
this
reason,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
emphasis
on
the
political
makeup
of
the
commission
is
somewhat
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
has
happened
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
points
up
the
exact
situation,
certainly
the
issues
that
come
before
the
federal
trade
commission,
don't
follow
partisan
line.
even
if
some
tiny
weight
were
given
to
this
political
balance
element,
i
suggest
the
unanimity
rule
is
more
disruptive
than
the
two-to-one
rule,
because
with
the
unanimity
rule,
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
thus
as
to
give
to
the
dissenting
member
a
veto
over
valid
action
by
the
commission,
which
he
wouldn't
have
in
the
full
commission.
if
two
members
of
the
commission
dissent,
the
decision
goes
into
effect
nonetheless.
here
is
a
situation
where
one
member
dissents,
no
action
can
be
taken
at
all
and
then
there
is
some
practical
considerations
that
come
with
this.
the
commission
can't
know
in
advance
of
course
when
two
members
are
disqualified
and
three
members
are
sitting
whether
the
three
will
agree,
so
this
would
mean
that
the
cases
have
to
be
reheard
and
if
a
valid
or
qualified
--
another
qualified
member
couldn't
be
found
to
break
the
deadlock
there
might
be
no
valid
action
at
all.
now,
the
respondent
argues
that
the
case,
the
commission
should
act
by
an
absolute
majority
for
a
judicial
body.
i
think
the
short
answer
to
that
is
it
is
not.
it
is
a
quasi-judicial
and
quasi-legislative
agency.
it
does
not
have
the
attributes
or
powers
of
the
court,
it
never
has
had
them.
this
court
said
as
much
in
federal
trade
commission
against
the
eastman
kodak
many
years
ago.
there
are
some
other
practical
considerations
that
are
advanced
in
support
of
the
rule
by
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
two-to-one
decisions
are
inherently
unstable,
because
they
may
be
overruled
later
by
the
full
commission
or
they
may
be
overturned
in
appeals
by
the
courts.
well,
this
objection
really
goes
to
an
institutional
problem
that
all
deliberative
bodies
are
faced
with,
the
close
decision.
the
principles
underlying
a
three-to-two
decision
may
be
modified
because
of
a
subsequent
change
in
the
commission's
membership
or
because
the
commissioner
has
changed
his
thinking
or
because
he
has
been
persuaded
by
dissent
and
as
far
as
the
possibility
of
cases
being
changed
in
the
courts
of
appeals
are
concerned
any
decision
that
is
supported
by
a
well-reasoned
dissent
invites
resort
to
the
courts
by
the
losing
party.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
what
it
comes
down
to
is
that
two-to-one
decisions
are
invalid.
there
were
times
when
the
commission
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
act
at
all.
if
the
commission
can
act
with
a
two-to-one
decision,
there
may
be
some
disadvantages
on
occasion
because
after
all
we
are
dealing
with
the
situation
in
which
you
are
faced
with
some
imperfection
in
the
administrative
process,
because
a
full
commission
isn't
available,
but
you
have
to
balance
the
consequences
of
permitting
a
veto
on
the
one
hand
against
the
effective
performance
of
the
commission's
duty
on
the
other.
now
in
the
absence
of
some
of
congressional
expressions
to
contrary,
i
think
that
the
general
rule
that
ordinarily
applies
to
deliberative
bodies
applies
to
the
federal
trade
commission
just
as
it
applies
to
all
the
other
administrative
agencies.
for
these
reasons,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
erred
that
its
rule
would
simply
serve
either
to
bar
action
by
the
commission
in
some
cases
or
to
deter
the
expression
of
dissenting
views
and
that
neither
of
these
possibilities,
which
server
the
purposes
underlying
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
i
think
i
have
been
trying
to
answer
it
[laughter]
as
fairly
as
i
can.
the
reorganization
plan
when
is
intended
to
give
the
commission
more
flexibility
in
carrying
out
its
functions,
it
was
not
intended
to
correct
any
oversight
about
the
nature
of
quorums
in
the
commission.
now
the
commission
here
hasn't
purported
to
act
under
the
reorganization
plan
because
it
did
not
have
available
a
full
--
well,
because
it
has
never
felt
it
necessary
for
it
to
sit
in
panels
of
two
or
one
or
three,
simply
as
a
matter
of
general
practice.
what
it
has
done
is
to
adopt
--
is
to
adhere
to
its
rule
now
some
50
years
old
that
when
it
can't
sit
except
with
the
fair
majority,
then
it
will
go
on
and
carry
on
its
business.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
have
been
i
think
30
cases,
where
only
three
have
sat
because
of
vacancies
on
the
commission
and
disqualifications.
it
was
not
a
choice
of
the
full
commission
to
sit
with
only
three,
it
was
a
necessity
that
they
felt
they
had.
they
had
to
sit
with
three
because
they
just
were
not
the
other
members
available.
of
the
30
cases,
17
resulted
in
unanimous
decisions
by
the
three
members
and
13
they
were
dissents,
they
were
two-to-one
decisions.
the
reorganization
plan
does
not
is
not
the
basis
for
the
commission's
action
here
and
it
did
not
purport
to
act
on
reorganization
plan.
we
refer
to
it
because
it
does
indicate
that
less
than
a
full
commission
can
take
valid
action.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
don't
believe
the
full
text
is
set
out,
your
honor,
but
it
is
in
section
1(b)
i
think
of
the
reorganization
plan
and
it
provides
that
the
commission
may
delegate
its
authority
to
perform
any
of
its
function
directly
to
a
division
or
panel
or
any
employee
provided
that
if
--
i
think
it
is
provided
that
a
final
action
is
taken
disposing
of
a
case.
now,
this
is
rough
paraphrase.
the
commission
on
a
vote
of
a
minority
of
its
membership
may
call
that
final
action
up
for
review.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it's
a
discretion,
it
is
a
vote
in
the
--
in
order
to
have
it
reviewed,
it
would
take
a
vote
of
two
members
of
the
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
point.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
any
two
members
who
are
qualified
to
sit
and
that's
the
real
problem
that
you
may
have
a
case
in
which
for
some
reason,
while
you
may
have
a
case
in
which
there
are
only
four
members
available.
of
the
four,
one
of
them
may
feel
he
is
disqualified,
or
should
not
participate
for
some
reason.
if
he
does,
you
have
only
got
three
members
left
on
the
commission
who
can
then
consider
the
question
of
reviewing
what
the
panel
of
the
commission
did.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
under
the
reorganization
plan
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
would
really
be
a
question
of
straight
rehearing
by
the
three,
trying
to
decide
whether
they
should
grant
a
rehearing
in
that
discretion.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
likely
you
have
to
change
your
mind
would
be
so
much
more.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
it
would
not
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
plan,
it
was
designed
to
give
flexibility
to
the
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
partly
it's
a
matter
of
the
five
members
agreeing
as
to
how
they
want
to
delegate
their
functions
i
think.
they
have
delegated
the
functions
in
part
as
i
mentioned
to
you
for
purposes
for
interlocutory
appeals
and
the
like
but
that
is
as
far
as
they
feel
they
should
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
the
case
your
honor.
the
action
by
three
members
is
not
a
delegation,
this
is
really
just
the
quorum
rule
on
how
they
are
going
to
carry
on
their
business
when
there
are
not
enough
available.
well,
i
see,
my
time
is
up.
i
believe
that
it
arguably
could
follow
the
time
for
appealing
many
decisions
has
to
come
final.
we
are
really
concerned
with
the
impact
of
the
decision
on
the
commission's
general
operations.
thank
you.
