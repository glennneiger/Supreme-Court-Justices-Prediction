justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
call
a
division
of
the
commission?
i
see
that
the
reorganization
plan
also
provides
more
delegating
through
a
division.
is
this
comparable
to
the
authority,
say
in
the
icc
by
statute
to
delegate
through
a
camera?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
but
it
certainly
seems
that
this
plan
would
contemplate
forbidding
the
commission
to
delegate
to
a
panel
but
in
that
event
i
suppose
the
panel
would
be
at
least
three,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
it
would
be
subject
to
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
are
saying
that
we
can
do
that
--
we
can
sit
as
three
members
no
matter
what
and
without
using
our
power
under
the
reorganization
plan,
which
should
require
a
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
never
needed
the
authority
to
sit
as
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
the
reorganization
act
does
permit
the
?
make
them
sit
in
a
panel?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that
would
not
be
the
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
three
was
a
quorum?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
argument
--
well,
in
this
argument
however,
the
point
you
should
be
making
up
here
is
that
commission
erred
in
not
granting
a
petition
for
rehearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
what
you
are
arguing
here,
that
they
should
have
granted
your
petition
for
rehearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
could
argue
that
this
is
the
actual
commission
having
a
hearing
for
three
and
have
refusing
the
petition
for
rehearing
is
that,
is
the
commission
designating
a
panel
to
overhearing,
is
that
going
to
effective
whether
they
pass
a
rule
or
not,
they
nevertheless
are
purporting
to
have
a
hearing
and
as
you
said
--
justice
byron
r.
white
for
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
before
the
fact,
they
said
it's
three,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
added
ripped
out
an
order
and
said
with
respect
to
reorganization
act
we
hereby
say
that
three
officers
are
going
to
sit.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
provision
in
the
reorganization
plan
from
the
rehearing
by
the
full
commission,
is
that
set
up
in
your
brief
anywhere
the
actual
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
such
a
cases
that
it
has
no
right
to
have
a
rehearing,
commission
has
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
there
you
got
in
your
brief,
say
it
would
be
subject
to
review
by
the
full
agency
upon
the
vote
of
a
majority
of
the
agency
less
one
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
so
any
two
members?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
not
under
the
reorganization
plan,
but
this
has
to
be
let
us
assume
that
commission
did
exercise
its
power
under
the
reorganization
plan
to
hear
en
banc,
set
the
panel
for
three
for
the
vote
of
two
and
then
there
were
two
vacancies.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
that,
you
can
never
have
a
rehearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
if
two
people
holding
one
way
by
it
would
not
be
about
to
have
a
rehearing.
justice
byron
r.

what
would
you
call
a
division
of
the
commission?
i
