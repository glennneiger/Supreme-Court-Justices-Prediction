justice
abe
fortas
on
the
other
hand,
you
might
have
a
different
issue
if
this
were
a
case
where
the
commission
has
just
decided
pursuant
to
the
reorganization
plan
or
otherwise
that
it
would
best
plan
on
commission
authority
in
a
panel
of
three.
here
i
take
it
that
there
is
no
suggestion
that
this
was
a
deliberate
voluntary
decision
of
the
commission,
but
rather
that
this
panel
which
is
consisted
of
the
only
qualified
members
of
the
commission
at
the
time
the
hearing
was
held?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
you
agree
or
don't
you
that
may
be
a
substantial
difference
between
the
two
cases
that
i
put
to
you?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
if
the
commission
decided
to
acquire
qualified
members
in
a
particular
case,
commission
then
ordered
that
hearing
will
be
held
before
three
of
them
and
i
should
think
that
in
all
probability
they
would
have
to
provide
for
an
appeal
to
the
full
commission
under
the
reorganization
plan?
justice
abe
fortas
if
they
did
not
do
so
provide
for
that
appeal
on
these
circumstances,
you
might
have
a
case.
it
is
quite
different
from
what
the
present
case
appears
to
be.
as
i
understand
it
in
the
present
case,
this
was
a
commission
composed
of
all
of
the
eligible
members
at
that
time?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
is
quite
customary,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
long
has
this
quorum
provision
been
on
the
ftc
rules?
justice
abe
fortas
since
19-what?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
know,
i
understand
that
but
your
argument
up
to
this
time
sounded
to
me
as
if
you
were
arguing
against
the
three-man
quorum,
that
you
said
that
some
wicked
president
may
come
along
in
appoint
three-man
by
the
commission
of
his
own
party
and
they
would
function
as
a
commission
and
he
won't
appoint
any
minority
members
and
summarily
it
seemed
to
me
you
are
arguing
against
the
three-man
quorum?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
had
three
republicans
and
all
three
of
them
agreed,
there
would
still
be
a
decision
by
the
three
republicans
