mr.
craig
spangenberg
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
this
case
comes
before
you
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
you
will
review
an
order
of
disbarring
petitioner,
john
ruffalo
jr.
in
that
court.
that
order
was
in
turn
based
upon
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
that
action
being
not
here
for
review.
ohio
had
suspended
ruffalo
on
two
charges.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
one
charge
justified
disbarment
from
its
roles.
the
district
court
had
earlier
reviewed,
the
ohio
disbarment
had
found
that
neither
charge
justified
the
striking
of
ruffalo
from
the
rules,
but
after
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
the
district
court
entered
a
second
order
saying
that
although
still
convinced
that
he
was
right,
he
would
bow
to
the
judgment
of
his
superior
court.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
no,
suspension,
mr.
justice.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
in
words,
no
lawyer
who
has
ever
been
suspended
in
ohio
has
ever
been
reinstated
as
you
may
know.
but
technically,
after
two
years,
he
can
apply
for
readmission.
he
can
take
the
bar
again
if
he
is
given
the
right
to,
by
the
supreme
court.
it
is
not
total
disbarment
for
life.
there
is
a
right
to
reapply.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
after
two
years.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
that's
right.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
there
is
one
pending
now
where
there
are
some
speculation
he
may
be,
and
so
it
will
be
unique.
but
the
case
involves
chiefly
one
michael
orlando.
he
was
a
nightshift
inspector,
a
car
inspector
for
the
b.&
o.
railroad.
he
bled
the
air
from
the
break
systems
of
incoming
cars.
i
make
this
point
as
to
his
non-trust,
non-confidential,
non-secret
position
because
he
has
been
described
in
other
opinions
as
an
espionage
agent,
as
secret
agent
planted
in
the
shops.
i
do
want
to
make
it
clear
that
in
the
sense
of
espionage,
he
had
no
access
to
anything
worth
extracting
from
company
files.
he
was
an
investigator.
he
had
general
knowledge
of
railroad
and
useful
to
ruffalo
and
the
ability
to
talk
to
railroad
men
in
railroader's
language
which
his
useful
to
any
lawyer
who
has
a
railroad
case.
in
the
ohio
practice,
charges
are
tried
first
before
a
panel
of
three
lawyers.
their
record
and
findings
are
reviewed
by
a
board
of
17.
their
decision
is
reviewed
in
turn
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
which
says
it
has
final
authority
to
say
what
the
facts
are
and
what
should
be
done.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
they
appoint
the
board
of
commissioners,
that's
the
17.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
the
panel
comes
from
the
board.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
i
don't
know
the
length
of
the
term.
it's
a
long
term.
they
are
not
appointed
for
the
case.
they
are
a
standing
board.
the
original
charges
had
been
developed
against
ruffalo
by
detectives
of
the
american
association
of
railroads
presented
to
the
local
bar
association,
which
invoked
the
hearings.
before
the
panel
of
three
conducting
the
primary
hearing,
there
were
two
charges
that
had
to
do
with
ruffalo.
one,
that
ruffalo
through
--
through
two
charges
that
had
to
do
with
orlando,
one,
that
ruffalo,
through
orlando,
had
solicited
the
claim
of
a
sam
cotellesse
against
the
p&le
railroad,
that
was
charge
four.
charge
five,
that
ruffalo
had
attempted
to
solicit
through
orlando
the
claim
of
one
quinn
against
the
b.&
o.
both
charges
were
dismissed
by
the
panel
at
the
first
level
for
one
of
any
evidence.
during
the
hearing
on
those
charges
which
were
unsupported
and
later
to
be
dismissed,
ruffalo,
the
respondent,
was
himself
called
for
cross-examination
under
ohio
practice
and
testified
before
the
panel,
defending
himself
on
the
charge
of
solicitation
through
orlando.
he
said
that
orlando
was
only
an
investigator
who
gave
ruffalo
expert
advice
on
general
railroading
practices,
who
located
witnesses,
sometimes
interviewed
them,
sometimes
--
and
often
drove
witnesses
to
courts
so
they
would
be
available
to
testify.
orlando
investigated
all
of
ruffalo's
railroad
cases,
some
of
them
were
against
the
b
&
o.
no
evidence
was
ever
developed
to
any
greater
extent
as
to
just
what
orlando
did.
for
example,
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
ever
investigated
a
case
in
the
yard
in
which
he
worked,
certainly,
no
evidence
that
he
ever
investigated
at
night
when
he
should
have
been
on
duty
on
his
own
railroad.
ruffalo
said
he
paid
him
piece
work,
$25.00
a
day
and
expenses
and
the
mathematic
shows
that
he
averages
10
days
a
month
or
thereabout
which
is
consistent
with
orlando's
own
testimony.
orlando
was
called,
he
testified
to
the
same
extent.
after
these
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
no,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
except
that
it
shows
that
orlando
was
a
former
client
of
ruffalo's
and
had
worked
for
ruffalo
as
an
investigator
for
many
years,
not
only
in
railroad
cases.
he
also
did
some
work
in
trucking
cases.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
he
had
said
that
generally
(voice
overlap).
if
there's
intellectual
curiosity
about
orlando,
he
had
worked
for
john's
father
before
him,
john
ruffalo,
sr.
was
a
well-known
railroad
lawyer.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
if
i
not
mistaken.
and
then
after
ruffalo,
sr.died,
orlando
continued
to
work
for
john,
jr.
and
had
work
for
him
since
1953.
that
is
in
the
record.
that
was
after
this
testimony
came
in
that
the
panel
added
the
charge,
in
these
words
that
ruffalo
did
conspire
with
orlando
and
paid
orlando
moneys
for
preparing
lawsuits
against
the
b.&
o.,
the
employer
of
orlando,
well
knowing
that
the
practice
was
deceptive
and
was
morally
and
legally
wrong
as
respects
orlando
toward
his
employer.
i
note
here
they
didn't
say
it
was
wrong
for
ruffalo
to
prepare
his
case
as
well.
they
said
it
was
wrong
for
orlando
toward
orlando's
employer
and
therefore
wrong
for
ruffalo
to
use
orlando
when
orlando
was
doing
something
that
is
disloyal
to
his
employer.
at
the
time
the
charge
was
added,
the
examiner
said
that
the
only
evidence
he
was
depending
upon
is
that
from
ruffalo's
own
lips
to
you,
gentlemen,
and
then
that
from
orlando
saying,
“we
don't
have
anything
else
to
support
it”.
however,
they
did
give
ruffalo
time
to
answer
the
charge
based
on
what
he
had
already
said
in
which
was
a
fairly
meaningless
procedure
since
there
was
nothing
to
add
or
take
away
from
it.
now,
i
realized
that
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
the
panel
said
that
was
wrong.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
said
that
a
man
who
would
hire
an
employee
and
investigated
to
work
against
the
interest
of
his
general
employer
was
not
morally
fit
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
ohio.
the
court
of
--
the
district
court
said,
“no”.
they
thought
it
was
a
proper
practice.
the
court
of
appeals,
said
that
if
we
--
the
profession
of
high-minded
man
must
rely
upon
planting
secret
agents
in
the
shops
of
those
we
call
to
account,
we
cannot
hope
to
enjoy
public
respect
and
they
would
not
find
it
unreasonable
for
ohio
to
say
that
this
would
justify
disbarment.
this
is
the
one
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
ruffalo
should
be
disbarred
from
the
court
of
appeals.
so
far
as
our
position
in
this
court
is
concerned,
i
realized
that
you
said
in
theard
that
the
state
court
finding
brought
title
deeds
of
high
respect.
but
i
realize
also
that
in
selling,
you
said
that
you
had
a
duty
not
to
disbar
unless
constrained
to
do
so
by
principles
of
right
and
justice.
we
all
recognized
that
to
a
trial
lawyer
of
the
law
is
his
life.
if
you
take
that
from
him,
you
have
taken
a
great
deal.
but
our
position
generally
is
that
even
a
lawyer
is
entitled
to
due
process
when
he
is
brought
up
on
charges,
and
chiefly,
that
he
ought
to
have
the
right
to
know
in
advance
that
what
he
is
doing
will
be
called
to
account
before
some
reviewing
court.
i
would
think
also
that
this
court
would
look
to
the
right
of
the
client,
the
right
of
the
public
to
have
his
case
well-prepared.
here,
i
realized
that
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“present
rules
of
discovery
will
do
all
you
need
to
do.”
i'm
afraid
the
court
of
appeals'
judges
who
wrote
that
have
never
been
down
on
the
battleground
trying
cases.
you
can't
have
discovery
on
the
federal
practice
until
you
file
the
petition,
you
can't
file
the
petition
unless
you
have
some
idea
what
the
accident
was
about,
and
indeed,
discovery
presupposes
that
we
both
investigate.
the
defendant
then
asked
me
what
i
have
found
out,
i
asked
him
what
he
has
found
out.
to
give
discovery
to
the
defendant,
i
must
do
some
preparation.
as
a
practical
matter
too,
it
helps
when
you
prepare
an
interrogatory
to
know
what
the
information
is
you're
trying
to
seek,
and
i
would
think
that
a
blind
reliance
on
no
preparation
at
all,
with
the
simply
list
of
interrogatories
after
you
filed
a
lawsuit
on
which
you
don't
know
whether
you
ought
to
believe
or
not,
does
not
really
serve
the
client
well.
our
canon
of
ethics
would
deny
to
railroad
employees,
in
the
sixth
circuit
at
least,
effective
legal
assistance
can
hardly
be
justified
unless
it
really
involves
some
basic
immorality.
but
let's
take
a
simple
example,
your
honors.
suppose
a
widow
calls
me,
i
do
some
railroad
work,
not
a
great
deal,
but
some,
says
her
husband
has
been
killed
on
the
railroad.
she
has
no
real
knowledge
what
happens.
she's
heard
some
rumors,
in
those
cases
and
they
have
happened.
it's
commonplace
to
call
a
former
client
who
you
know
works
on
the
railroad
and
ask
him
if
he
will
come
in
and
tell
you
what
he
knows,
what
has
he
heard,
and
what
area
of
the
yard
did
it
happen,
what
track,
what
generally
is
the
story
around
the
yard
as
to
how
the
accident
happened.
and
these
men
generally
are
willing
to
come
in
but
always
with
a
caveat.
i'll
have
to
mark
off
if
i
do,
“will
you
pay
me
for
my
time?”
well,
of
course,
you'll
pay
him
for
his
time.
in
the
same
way
in
an
admiralty
case
who
will
pay
a
seaman
first
time
to
come
in
and
tell
us
what
is
the
layout
of
the
boat.
what
kind
of
tackle?
what
kind
of
equipment
was
involved
in
the
accident?
and
lawyers
do
pay
money
to
employees
of
corporate
defendant
for
information
necessary
to
get
some
knowledge
of
the
case
and
to
lead
them
into
further
exploration.
but
the
simple
act
of
like
paying
an
employee
of
say
the
river
terminal
railroad,
to
come
in
and
tell
what
he
has
heard,
would
now
be
condemned
by
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
because
there
is
no
question
but
that
it
is
a
payment
of
money
to
a
general
employee
for
information
helpful
in
preparing
a
case
against
that
railroad.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
i
am
presupposing
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
i'm
giving
you
the
same
example
and
that
the
widow
said
her
husband
was
called
on
the
river
terminal.
the
only
one
who'll
know
about
that
is
a
river
terminal
employee
and
which
i'm
quite
likely
to
find
one
and
ask
him
to
come
in
and
tell
me
about
it
and
pay
him
the
first
time.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
i
think
he
would
do
better
to
call
a
b.&
o.
man
than
a
pennsy
man
if
he
wants
to
know
what
the
track
layout
was,
where
the
latter
goes,
what
the
rip
track
--
where
the
rip
track
located
and
so
forth.
a
yard
layout
should
do
get
from
a
man
who
works
in
the
yard
or
who
has
worked
in
the
yard.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
apparently
so,
they
made
a
good
deal
of
the
point
of
the
statute,
section
60
of
fela
that
makes
it
illegal
to
try,
for
the
railroad
to
try
and
keep
its
employees
from
giving
information
as
written
in
terms
of
voluntarily
furnishing
information.
so
they
said
that
although
orlando,
as
an
employee,
could
voluntarily
give
the
information
he
couldn't
be
paid
for
giving
the
information
to
ruffalo.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
it's
all
they
said.
you'll
find
that
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio's
opinion
where
that
point
was
raised.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
your
honor.
they
said
they
can,
they
can
take
money
for
it
or
be
paid
for
doing
it.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
no.
no
the
court
of
appeals
simply
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
pardon?
mr.
craig
spangenberg
please
do
not
be
misled,
mr.
justice.
the
district
court
said
that
he
could
see
nothing
wrong
with
it
and
that
ruffalo's
right
to
practice
in
the
federal
district
court
would
be
upheld.
that's
where
fela
cases
are
generally
tried.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
they
may
be.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
you
could
do
that.
in
which
case,
mr.
ruffalo
would
be
reinstated
to
practice
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
there
is
no
doubt
from
the
opinion
in
the
district
court
that
he
would
welcome
this
opportunity
to
say
to
reinstate
ruffalo
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
the
power
of
this
court
to
review
the
circuit
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
to
review
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
strikes
a
lawyer
from
its
roles,
in
the
sense
that
you
do
have
power
of
review
as
part
of
your
general
supervisory
power
of
that
court.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
no,
i
do
not
suggest
--
i
think
that
you
could
if
you
chose
to.
i
think
you
would
not
choose
to.
i
think
you
would
review
the
record
as
it
is
in
the
same
way
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
merely
reviewed
the
ohio
findings.
you
are
entitled
to
review
that
ohio
findings
and
say
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
well,
i
do
not
want
to
yield
the
point
completely,
mr.
justice,
but
i
would
say
that
if
this
court
wrote
an
opinion
saying
that
in
its
opinion,
his
conduct
is
not
shameful,
does
not
show
bad
moral
character,
that
it
will
certainly
lead
the
district
court
to
follow
the
superior
court
that
is
superior
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
the
district
court
now
feels
constrained
to
follow.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
he
is,
your
honor.
you
may
consider
this
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
i
have
waived
notice
in
my
brief
and
in
the
petition
for
writ,
i've
said
that
you
may
consider
this
as
your
own
hearing
on
whether
you
will
disbar
mr.
ruffalo
out
of
this
court.
i
certainly
do
not
ask
you
to
hold
a
separate
hearing
on
the
matter
that
you
will
consider
here
thoroughly
on
the
same
record.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
there
is
certainly
a
due
process
question
here,
your
honor,
and
that
there
is
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
well,
i
thought
he
was
addressing
to
whether
you
could
now
go
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
i
am
not
sure
that
you
can,
perhaps
you
can.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
i
would
like
to
come
to
that,
your
honor,
and
state
that
in
ohio,
misconduct
is
a
defined
offense,
defined
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
in
all
judgments.
i
say
that
he
was
denied
due
process
in
ohio.
he
was
disbarred
in
complete
contradiction
of
every
fundamental
concept
of
due
process.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
well,
your
honors,
you
have
said
in
theard
and
in
selling
that
you
would
review
the
state
court
proceedings
to
see
whether
or
not
the
respondent
received
due
process
in
the
state
court.
this
against
the
argument
generally
made
its
unseemly
to
the
federal
court
to
retain
on
its
roles,
a
lawyer
who
has
been
disbarred
by
the
state.
it
is
rather
more
unseemly
to
strike
him
from
your
roles
if
he
was
disbarred
from
the
state
in
complete
contravention
of
our
fundamental
notions
of
due
process
because
you
are
a
constitutional
court.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes.
i
say
also
that
--
i
would
hope
this
court
would
reverse
at
least
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
said
that
due
process
does
not
require
bar
associations
to
fashion
that
canon
of
ethics,
to
define
the
impermissible
conduct
in
advance.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was,
our
profession
is
not
summarily
and
ethically
naïve
as
to
need
advanced
definition
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
the
impermissible
behavior.
to
me,
this
is
a
critical
point.i
think
lawyers
do
need
advanced
definition
from
some
source.
it
may
be
that
the
wrong
is
so
universally
recognized
that
you
need
not
spell
it
out,
but
for
a
course
of
conduct
that
has
been
followed
by
lawyers
from
time
in
memorial,
i
think
you
do
need
advance
definition
when
you're
going
to
say,
from
now
on
this
is
improper
and
we
will
disbar
a
man
who
did
it
before
we
ever
said
it
was
improper.
to
say
that
you
cannot
pay
for
information
is
to
say
that
every
district
attorney
in
the
united
states
should
be
disbarred,
i
would
assume,
if
he
uses
the
information
that
comes
from
a
paid
informer
who
actually
breaches
someone's
trust
which
isn't
much
go
as
much
deeper
than
this
business
of
using
a
simple
yard
laborer
as
an
investigator.
and
note,
ohio
had
said
that
misconduct,
as
a
defined
offense,
consists
of
a
violation
of
the
canon
of
professional
ethics.
there
are
47
of
those
who
any
lawyer
could
read
through
the
47
and
know
generally
what
he
could
do
and
what
he
could
not
do.
but
if
they
say
this
is
misconduct,
and
then
they
do,
misconduct
is
defined
as
the
term
as
used
herein,
says
ohio,
as
a
violation
of
the
canons
of
professional
ethics.
no
one
has
been
able
to
find
anywhere
in
all
of
the
47
canons
where
this
kind
of
views
of
an
investigator
violates
anything
or
even
comes
close
to
violating
a
canon
of
ethics.
now
this
was
the
argument
i
made
in
the
court
of
appeals,
saying
it
is
not
wrong
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
due
process
doesn't
require
the
bar
association
to
fashion
a
canon
of
ethics
in
advance
on
this
ground
that
our
lawyers
are
just
not
ethically
naïve.
i
quote
the
court
exactly
in
language
that
i've
said
in
my
brief.
i
thought
it
was
rather
prim,
if
a
lawyer
can
read
all
of
draco's
legal
ethics,
which
is
the
leading
text,
read
all
the
canons
and
read
every
decision
in
the
united
states
and
find
no
word
anywhere
that
hiring
a
man
like
orlando
is
wrong,
then
on
what
--
how
does
due
process
get
satisfied?
how
do
you
reconcile
this
with
lanzetta,
with
connolly,
with
giaccio,
with
bouie
where
you've
said
in
every
kind
of
proceeding,
where
there
is
to
be
some
criminal
or
quasi-criminal
penalty,
an
advanced
definition
is
needed.
and
particularly,
when
you
give
an
advanced
definition,
this
is
your
decision
in
bouie
of
course,
if
you
give
an
advanced
definition
as
ohio
has
saying,
it's
a
violation
of
a
canon
of
ethics,
how
can
you
then
say
you
have
satisfied
due
process
when
retroactively
you
expend
and
say
any
kind
of
conduct
that
we
deem
to
show
who
are
moral
character
will
be
enough
to
justify
disbarment
even
though
it
doesn't
violate
the
canon
of
ethics?
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
in
answer
to
the
question
that
was
put,
i
would
refer
you
simply
to
appendix
volume
i,
page
21(a).
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
the
question
about
the
part
of
the
--
of
mr.
brownlee
in
the
inception
of
the
charges
that's
covered
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
it
is
based
on
record
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
you
have
never
filed
a
motion
to
show
cause,
your
honor.
and
the
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
would
waive
motion
to
show
cause.
i
think
under
your
rules,
you
should
file
one.
i
have
said
we
will
treat
our
own
petition
as
a
response
to
the
motion
to
show
cause
which
you
have
not
filed.
and
as
your
disposition
on
the
appeal,
i
think
whatever
you
say
about
his
conduct,
you
may
say
for
yourselves.
we
do
not
ask
for
a
separate
hearing
or
a
separate
motion
to
show
cause
from
this
court.
the
matter
is
now
before
you
and
his
admission
to
the
bar
of
this
court
is
in
review
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
with
or
without,
we
are
content
to
rest
on
this
record
and
the
facts
that
it
shows
as
to
what
he
did
and
what
he
did
not
do.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
if
the
majority
of
this
court
feels,
that
that
shows
he
has
character
unworthy
of
a
lawyer,
then
disbar
him
here
too,
and
let
the
bar
of
the
country
know
that
how
far
we
can
go
in
representing
our
client.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
this
case
comes
before
you
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
you
will
review
an
order
of
disbarring
petitioner,
john
ruffalo
jr.
in
that
court.
that
order
was
in
turn
based
upon
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
that
action
being
not
here
for
review.
ohio
had
suspended
ruffalo
on
two
charges.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
one
charge
justified
disbarment
from
its
roles.
the
district
court
had
earlier
reviewed,
the
ohio
disbarment
had
found
that
neither
charge
justified
the
striking
of
ruffalo
from
the
rules,
but
after
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
the
district
court
entered
a
second
order
saying
that
although
still
convinced
that
he
was
right,
he
would
bow
to
the
judgment
of
his
superior
court.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
no,
suspension,
mr.
justice.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
in
words,
no
lawyer
who
has
ever
been
suspended
in
ohio
has
ever
been
reinstated
as
you
may
know.
but
technically,
after
two
years,
he
can
apply
for
readmission.
he
can
take
the
bar
again
if
he
is
given
the
right
to,
by
the
supreme
court.
it
is
not
total
disbarment
for
life.
there
is
a
right
to
reapply.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
after
two
years.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
that's
right.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
there
is
one
pending
now
where
there
are
some
speculation
he
may
be,
and
so
it
will
be
unique.
but
the
case
involves
chiefly
one
michael
orlando.
he
was
a
nightshift
inspector,
a
car
inspector
for
the
b.&
o.
railroad.
he
bled
the
air
from
the
break
systems
of
incoming
cars.
i
make
this
point
as
to
his
non-trust,
non-confidential,
non-secret
position
because
he
has
been
described
in
other
opinions
as
an
espionage
agent,
as
secret
agent
planted
in
the
shops.
i
do
want
to
make
it
clear
that
in
the
sense
of
espionage,
he
had
no
access
to
anything
worth
extracting
from
company
files.
he
was
an
investigator.
he
had
general
knowledge
of
railroad
and
useful
to
ruffalo
and
the
ability
to
talk
to
railroad
men
in
railroader's
language
which
his
useful
to
any
lawyer
who
has
a
railroad
case.
in
the
ohio
practice,
charges
are
tried
first
before
a
panel
of
three
lawyers.
their
record
and
findings
are
reviewed
by
a
board
of
17.
their
decision
is
reviewed
in
turn
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
which
says
it
has
final
authority
to
say
what
the
facts
are
and
what
should
be
done.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
they
appoint
the
board
of
commissioners,
that's
the
17.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
the
panel
comes
from
the
board.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
i
don't
know
the
length
of
the
term.
it's
a
long
term.
they
are
not
appointed
for
the
case.
they
are
a
standing
board.
the
original
charges
had
been
developed
against
ruffalo
by
detectives
of
the
american
association
of
railroads
presented
to
the
local
bar
association,
which
invoked
the
hearings.
before
the
panel
of
three
conducting
the
primary
hearing,
there
were
two
charges
that
had
to
do
with
ruffalo.
one,
that
ruffalo
through
--
through
two
charges
that
had
to
do
with
orlando,
one,
that
ruffalo,
through
orlando,
had
solicited
the
claim
of
a
sam
cotellesse
against
the
p&le
railroad,
that
was
charge
four.
charge
five,
that
ruffalo
had
attempted
to
solicit
through
orlando
the
claim
of
one
quinn
against
the
b.&
o.
both
charges
were
dismissed
by
the
panel
at
the
first
level
for
one
of
any
evidence.
during
the
hearing
on
those
charges
which
were
unsupported
and
later
to
be
dismissed,
ruffalo,
the
respondent,
was
himself
called
for
cross-examination
under
ohio
practice
and
testified
before
the
panel,
defending
himself
on
the
charge
of
solicitation
through
orlando.
he
said
that
orlando
was
only
an
investigator
who
gave
ruffalo
expert
advice
on
general
railroading
practices,
who
located
witnesses,
sometimes
interviewed
them,
sometimes
--
and
often
drove
witnesses
to
courts
so
they
would
be
available
to
testify.
orlando
investigated
all
of
ruffalo's
railroad
cases,
some
of
them
were
against
the
b
&
o.
no
evidence
was
ever
developed
to
any
greater
extent
as
to
just
what
orlando
did.
for
example,
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
ever
investigated
a
case
in
the
yard
in
which
he
worked,
certainly,
no
evidence
that
he
ever
investigated
at
night
when
he
should
have
been
on
duty
on
his
own
railroad.
ruffalo
said
he
paid
him
piece
work,
$25.00
a
day
and
expenses
and
the
mathematic
shows
that
he
averages
10
days
a
month
or
thereabout
which
is
consistent
with
orlando's
own
testimony.
orlando
was
called,
he
testified
to
the
same
extent.
after
these
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
no,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
except
that
it
shows
that
orlando
was
a
former
client
of
ruffalo's
and
had
worked
for
ruffalo
as
an
investigator
for
many
years,
not
only
in
railroad
cases.
he
also
did
some
work
in
trucking
cases.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
he
had
said
that
generally
(voice
overlap).
if
there's
intellectual
curiosity
about
orlando,
he
had
worked
for
john's
father
before
him,
john
ruffalo,
sr.
was
a
well-known
railroad
lawyer.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
if
i
not
mistaken.
and
then
after
ruffalo,
sr.died,
orlando
continued
to
work
for
john,
jr.
and
had
work
for
him
since
1953.
that
is
in
the
record.
that
was
after
this
testimony
came
in
that
the
panel
added
the
charge,
in
these
words
that
ruffalo
did
conspire
with
orlando
and
paid
orlando
moneys
for
preparing
lawsuits
against
the
b.&
o.,
the
employer
of
orlando,
well
knowing
that
the
practice
was
deceptive
and
was
morally
and
legally
wrong
as
respects
orlando
toward
his
employer.
i
note
here
they
didn't
say
it
was
wrong
for
ruffalo
to
prepare
his
case
as
well.
they
said
it
was
wrong
for
orlando
toward
orlando's
employer
and
therefore
wrong
for
ruffalo
to
use
orlando
when
orlando
was
doing
something
that
is
disloyal
to
his
employer.
at
the
time
the
charge
was
added,
the
examiner
said
that
the
only
evidence
he
was
depending
upon
is
that
from
ruffalo's
own
lips
to
you,
gentlemen,
and
then
that
from
orlando
saying,
“we
don't
have
anything
else
to
support
it”.
however,
they
did
give
ruffalo
time
to
answer
the
charge
based
on
what
he
had
already
said
in
which
was
a
fairly
meaningless
procedure
since
there
was
nothing
to
add
or
take
away
from
it.
now,
i
realized
that
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
the
panel
said
that
was
wrong.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
said
that
a
man
who
would
hire
an
employee
and
investigated
to
work
against
the
interest
of
his
general
employer
was
not
morally
fit
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
ohio.
the
court
of
--
the
district
court
said,
“no”.
they
thought
it
was
a
proper
practice.
the
court
of
appeals,
said
that
if
we
--
the
profession
of
high-minded
man
must
rely
upon
planting
secret
agents
in
the
shops
of
those
we
call
to
account,
we
cannot
hope
to
enjoy
public
respect
and
they
would
not
find
it
unreasonable
for
ohio
to
say
that
this
would
justify
disbarment.
this
is
the
one
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
ruffalo
should
be
disbarred
from
the
court
of
appeals.
so
far
as
our
position
in
this
court
is
concerned,
i
realized
that
you
said
in
theard
that
the
state
court
finding
brought
title
deeds
of
high
respect.
but
i
realize
also
that
in
selling,
you
said
that
you
had
a
duty
not
to
disbar
unless
constrained
to
do
so
by
principles
of
right
and
justice.
we
all
recognized
that
to
a
trial
lawyer
of
the
law
is
his
life.
if
you
take
that
from
him,
you
have
taken
a
great
deal.
but
our
position
generally
is
that
even
a
lawyer
is
entitled
to
due
process
when
he
is
brought
up
on
charges,
and
chiefly,
that
he
ought
to
have
the
right
to
know
in
advance
that
what
he
is
doing
will
be
called
to
account
before
some
reviewing
court.
i
would
think
also
that
this
court
would
look
to
the
right
of
the
client,
the
right
of
the
public
to
have
his
case
well-prepared.
here,
i
realized
that
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“present
rules
of
discovery
will
do
all
you
need
to
do.”
i'm
afraid
the
court
of
appeals'
judges
who
wrote
that
have
never
been
down
on
the
battleground
trying
cases.
you
can't
have
discovery
on
the
federal
practice
until
you
file
the
petition,
you
can't
file
the
petition
unless
you
have
some
idea
what
the
accident
was
about,
and
indeed,
discovery
presupposes
that
we
both
investigate.
the
defendant
then
asked
me
what
i
have
found
out,
i
asked
him
what
he
has
found
out.
to
give
discovery
to
the
defendant,
i
must
do
some
preparation.
as
a
practical
matter
too,
it
helps
when
you
prepare
an
interrogatory
to
know
what
the
information
is
you're
trying
to
seek,
and
i
would
think
that
a
blind
reliance
on
no
preparation
at
all,
with
the
simply
list
of
interrogatories
after
you
filed
a
lawsuit
on
which
you
don't
know
whether
you
ought
to
believe
or
not,
does
not
really
serve
the
client
well.
our
canon
of
ethics
would
deny
to
railroad
employees,
in
the
sixth
circuit
at
least,
effective
legal
assistance
can
hardly
be
justified
unless
it
really
involves
some
basic
immorality.
but
let's
take
a
simple
example,
your
honors.
suppose
a
widow
calls
me,
i
do
some
railroad
work,
not
a
great
deal,
but
some,
says
her
husband
has
been
killed
on
the
railroad.
she
has
no
real
knowledge
what
happens.
she's
heard
some
rumors,
in
those
cases
and
they
have
happened.
it's
commonplace
to
call
a
former
client
who
you
know
works
on
the
railroad
and
ask
him
if
he
will
come
in
and
tell
you
what
he
knows,
what
has
he
heard,
and
what
area
of
the
yard
did
it
happen,
what
track,
what
generally
is
the
story
around
the
yard
as
to
how
the
accident
happened.
and
these
men
generally
are
willing
to
come
in
but
always
with
a
caveat.
i'll
have
to
mark
off
if
i
do,
“will
you
pay
me
for
my
time?”
well,
of
course,
you'll
pay
him
for
his
time.
in
the
same
way
in
an
admiralty
case
who
will
pay
a
seaman
first
time
to
come
in
and
tell
us
what
is
the
layout
of
the
boat.
what
kind
of
tackle?
what
kind
of
equipment
was
involved
in
the
accident?
and
lawyers
do
pay
money
to
employees
of
corporate
defendant
for
information
necessary
to
get
some
knowledge
of
the
case
and
to
lead
them
into
further
exploration.
but
the
simple
act
of
like
paying
an
employee
of
say
the
river
terminal
railroad,
to
come
in
and
tell
what
he
has
heard,
would
now
be
condemned
by
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
because
there
is
no
question
but
that
it
is
a
payment
of
money
to
a
general
employee
for
information
helpful
in
preparing
a
case
against
that
railroad.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
i
am
presupposing
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
i'm
giving
you
the
same
example
and
that
the
widow
said
her
husband
was
called
on
the
river
terminal.
the
only
one
who'll
know
about
that
is
a
river
terminal
employee
and
which
i'm
quite
likely
to
find
one
and
ask
him
to
come
in
and
tell
me
about
it
and
pay
him
the
first
time.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
i
think
he
would
do
better
to
call
a
b.&
o.
man
than
a
pennsy
man
if
he
wants
to
know
what
the
track
layout
was,
where
the
latter
goes,
what
the
rip
track
--
where
the
rip
track
located
and
so
forth.
a
yard
layout
should
do
get
from
a
man
who
works
in
the
yard
or
who
has
worked
in
the
yard.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
apparently
so,
they
made
a
good
deal
of
the
point
of
the
statute,
section
60
of
fela
that
makes
it
illegal
to
try,
for
the
railroad
to
try
and
keep
its
employees
from
giving
information
as
written
in
terms
of
voluntarily
furnishing
information.
so
they
said
that
although
orlando,
as
an
employee,
could
voluntarily
give
the
information
he
couldn't
be
paid
for
giving
the
information
to
ruffalo.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
it's
all
they
said.
you'll
find
that
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio's
opinion
where
that
point
was
raised.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
your
honor.
they
said
they
can,
they
can
take
money
for
it
or
be
paid
for
doing
it.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
no.
no
the
court
of
appeals
simply
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
pardon?
mr.
craig
spangenberg
please
do
not
be
misled,
mr.
justice.
the
district
court
said
that
he
could
see
nothing
wrong
with
it
and
that
ruffalo's
right
to
practice
in
the
federal
district
court
would
be
upheld.
that's
where
fela
cases
are
generally
tried.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
they
may
be.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
you
could
do
that.
in
which
case,
mr.
ruffalo
would
be
reinstated
to
practice
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
there
is
no
doubt
from
the
opinion
in
the
district
court
that
he
would
welcome
this
opportunity
to
say
to
reinstate
ruffalo
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
the
power
of
this
court
to
review
the
circuit
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
to
review
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
strikes
a
lawyer
from
its
roles,
in
the
sense
that
you
do
have
power
of
review
as
part
of
your
general
supervisory
power
of
that
court.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
no,
i
do
not
suggest
--
i
think
that
you
could
if
you
chose
to.
i
think
you
would
not
choose
to.
i
think
you
would
review
the
record
as
it
is
in
the
same
way
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
merely
reviewed
the
ohio
findings.
you
are
entitled
to
review
that
ohio
findings
and
say
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
well,
i
do
not
want
to
yield
the
point
completely,
mr.
justice,
but
i
would
say
that
if
this
court
wrote
an
opinion
saying
that
in
its
opinion,
his
conduct
is
not
shameful,
does
not
show
bad
moral
character,
that
it
will
certainly
lead
the
district
court
to
follow
the
superior
court
that
is
superior
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
the
district
court
now
feels
constrained
to
follow.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes,
he
is,
your
honor.
you
may
consider
this
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
i
have
waived
notice
in
my
brief
and
in
the
petition
for
writ,
i've
said
that
you
may
consider
this
as
your
own
hearing
on
whether
you
will
disbar
mr.
ruffalo
out
of
this
court.
i
certainly
do
not
ask
you
to
hold
a
separate
hearing
on
the
matter
that
you
will
consider
here
thoroughly
on
the
same
record.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
there
is
certainly
a
due
process
question
here,
your
honor,
and
that
there
is
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
well,
i
thought
he
was
addressing
to
whether
you
could
now
go
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
i
am
not
sure
that
you
can,
perhaps
you
can.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
i
would
like
to
come
to
that,
your
honor,
and
state
that
in
ohio,
misconduct
is
a
defined
offense,
defined
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
in
all
judgments.
i
say
that
he
was
denied
due
process
in
ohio.
he
was
disbarred
in
complete
contradiction
of
every
fundamental
concept
of
due
process.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
well,
your
honors,
you
have
said
in
theard
and
in
selling
that
you
would
review
the
state
court
proceedings
to
see
whether
or
not
the
respondent
received
due
process
in
the
state
court.
this
against
the
argument
generally
made
its
unseemly
to
the
federal
court
to
retain
on
its
roles,
a
lawyer
who
has
been
disbarred
by
the
state.
it
is
rather
more
unseemly
to
strike
him
from
your
roles
if
he
was
disbarred
from
the
state
in
complete
contravention
of
our
fundamental
notions
of
due
process
because
you
are
a
constitutional
court.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
yes.
i
say
also
that
--
i
would
hope
this
court
would
reverse
at
least
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
said
that
due
process
does
not
require
bar
associations
to
fashion
that
canon
of
ethics,
to
define
the
impermissible
conduct
in
advance.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was,
our
profession
is
not
summarily
and
ethically
naïve
as
to
need
advanced
definition
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
the
impermissible
behavior.
to
me,
this
is
a
critical
point.i
think
lawyers
do
need
advanced
definition
from
some
source.
it
may
be
that
the
wrong
is
so
universally
recognized
that
you
need
not
spell
it
out,
but
for
a
course
of
conduct
that
has
been
followed
by
lawyers
from
time
in
memorial,
i
think
you
do
need
advance
definition
when
you're
going
to
say,
from
now
on
this
is
improper
and
we
will
disbar
a
man
who
did
it
before
we
ever
said
it
was
improper.
to
say
that
you
cannot
pay
for
information
is
to
say
that
every
district
attorney
in
the
united
states
should
be
disbarred,
i
would
assume,
if
he
uses
the
information
that
comes
from
a
paid
informer
who
actually
breaches
someone's
trust
which
isn't
much
go
as
much
deeper
than
this
business
of
using
a
simple
yard
laborer
as
an
investigator.
and
note,
ohio
had
said
that
misconduct,
as
a
defined
offense,
consists
of
a
violation
of
the
canon
of
professional
ethics.
there
are
47
of
those
who
any
lawyer
could
read
through
the
47
and
know
generally
what
he
could
do
and
what
he
could
not
do.
but
if
they
say
this
is
misconduct,
and
then
they
do,
misconduct
is
defined
as
the
term
as
used
herein,
says
ohio,
as
a
violation
of
the
canons
of
professional
ethics.
no
one
has
been
able
to
find
anywhere
in
all
of
the
47
canons
where
this
kind
of
views
of
an
investigator
violates
anything
or
even
comes
close
to
violating
a
canon
of
ethics.
now
this
was
the
argument
i
made
in
the
court
of
appeals,
saying
it
is
not
wrong
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
due
process
doesn't
require
the
bar
association
to
fashion
a
canon
of
ethics
in
advance
on
this
ground
that
our
lawyers
are
just
not
ethically
naïve.
i
quote
the
court
exactly
in
language
that
i've
said
in
my
brief.
i
thought
it
was
rather
prim,
if
a
lawyer
can
read
all
of
draco's
legal
ethics,
which
is
the
leading
text,
read
all
the
canons
and
read
every
decision
in
the
united
states
and
find
no
word
anywhere
that
hiring
a
man
like
orlando
is
wrong,
then
on
what
--
how
does
due
process
get
satisfied?
how
do
you
reconcile
this
with
lanzetta,
with
connolly,
with
giaccio,
with
bouie
where
you've
said
in
every
kind
of
proceeding,
where
there
is
to
be
some
criminal
or
quasi-criminal
penalty,
an
advanced
definition
is
needed.
and
particularly,
when
you
give
an
advanced
definition,
this
is
your
decision
in
bouie
of
course,
if
you
give
an
advanced
definition
as
ohio
has
saying,
it's
a
violation
of
a
canon
of
ethics,
how
can
you
then
say
you
have
satisfied
due
process
when
retroactively
you
expend
and
say
any
kind
of
conduct
that
we
deem
to
show
who
are
moral
character
will
be
enough
to
justify
disbarment
even
though
it
doesn't
violate
the
canon
of
ethics?
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
in
answer
to
the
question
that
was
put,
i
would
refer
you
simply
to
appendix
volume
i,
page
21(a).
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
the
question
about
the
part
of
the
--
of
mr.
brownlee
in
the
inception
of
the
charges
that's
covered
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
it
is
based
on
record
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
you
have
never
filed
a
motion
to
show
cause,
your
honor.
and
the
--
mr.
craig
spangenberg
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
would
waive
motion
to
show
cause.
i
think
under
your
rules,
you
should
file
one.
i
have
said
we
will
treat
our
own
petition
as
a
response
to
the
motion
to
show
cause
which
you
have
not
filed.
and
as
your
disposition
on
the
appeal,
i
think
whatever
you
say
about
his
conduct,
you
may
say
for
yourselves.
we
do
not
ask
for
a
separate
hearing
or
a
separate
motion
to
show
cause
from
this
court.
the
matter
is
now
before
you
and
his
admission
to
the
bar
of
this
court
is
in
review
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
with
or
without,
we
are
content
to
rest
on
this
record
and
the
facts
that
it
shows
as
to
what
he
did
and
what
he
did
not
do.
mr.
craig
spangenberg
if
the
majority
of
this
court
feels,
that
that
shows
he
has
character
unworthy
of
a
lawyer,
then
disbar
him
here
too,
and
let
the
bar
of
the
country
know
that
how
far
we
can
go
in
representing
our
client.
