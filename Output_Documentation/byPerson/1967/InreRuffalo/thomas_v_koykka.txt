mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
may
it
please
the
court.
we
should
have
in
mind
what
it
is
that
john
ruffalo
was
disbarred
for.
i
can
give
that
to
the
court
most
clearly
by
quoting
to
you
what
it
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
said.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
one
who
hires
an
experienced
lawyer,
and
here
was
a
lawyer
john
ruffalo
who
had
18
years
of
experience
at
the
bar
practicing
in
youngstown,
ohio,
to
act
as
an
undercover
agent
to
obtain
evidence
and
information
for
use
in
suits
against
his
own
employer
does
not
exhibit
the
fair
character
and
the
integrity
which
must
be
the
mark
of
a
lawyer.
the
court
said,
“we
do
not
believe
we
should
say
to
today's
society
of
whom
we
ask
that
our
profession
be
held
in
high
regard
that
we
do
not
have
the
ability
to
represent
our
clients
except
through
planting
secret
agents
in
the
shops
of
those
we
call
to
account
in
the
courts.
if
this
kind
of
espionage
is
--
has
become
a
way
of
life
in
some
of
today's
business,
more
is
expected
of
a
lawyer,
then
that
they
conform
to
the
minimal
standards
of
the
marketplace.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
i
walked
to
turn
to
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
may
i
first,
before
i
answer
it,
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
disbarred
this
man
because
he
was
dishonest.
i
want
to
return
to
that
later.
i'll
now
return
to
your
question,
mr.
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
because
he
was
dishonest
and
that
point,
i
want
to
develop
later
but
first,
i
want
to
answer
the
question
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
the
dishonesty
was
enlisting
an
employee
in
the
very
camp
of
the
party
he
was
suing
to
develop
evidence
against
that
party.
no
one
is
saying
to
this
lawyer
that
he
may
not
fully
investigate
cases.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
to
this
lawyer
is
that
a
lawyer
does
not
go
into
the
camp
of
the
party
he
is
suing
and
then
list
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
your
honor,
that
--
the
united
states
did
not
quite
do
that.
in
the
hoffa
case,
if
the
evidence
had
been
presented
here,
that
in
the
hoffa
case,
the
evidence
obtained
by
the
secret
agent
was
used
in
the
test
fleet
case.
i
think
you
would
have
had
an
entirely
different
question.
but
the
court
itself
made
the
distinction
in
the
hoffa
case
that
there,
the
evidence
that
was
obtained
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
true,
but
may
i
say
to
that,
that
different
policy
considerations
to
begin
with
come
into
play
there
and
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
criminal
elements
who
do
not
regard
and
have
no
respect
for
the
law.
now,
to
apply
that
same
analogy
here,
no
one
is
saying
to
mr.
ruffalo,
that
he
may
not
employ
an
undercover
agent
if
he
wishes
to.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
but
the
court
permitted
the
use
in
the
hoffa
case
of
that
evidence
which
was
obtained
by
the
undercover
agent.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
not
in
the
--
not
in
the
test
fleet
case.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
it
was
not
used
in
that.
that
was
the
case
which
was
on
trial
and
it
was
not
used
in
that
case
and
that
was
the
distinction
that
the
court
made
in
that
case.
that
it
was
evidence
that
was
used
to
convict
for
the
attempted
jury
tampering.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
defendants
were
hoffa
and
the
others
but
it
was
not
in
the
test
flee
case
that
the
evidence
was
used.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
this
testimony
was
used
against
the
b.&
o.,
yes
but
there
is
a
difference,
we
submit
to
your
honors,
in
a
situation
that
arises
in
a
civil
case
and
one
that
arises
in
a
criminal
case,
i
think
different
standards
are
applicable,
and
i
say
to
your
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
first
is
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
criminal
problem
with
an
element
which
does
not
respect
the
law.
that
is
point
number
one
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
true
but
we
are
not
saying
to
this
man
that
he
may
not
use
an
undercover
agent,
and
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
say
that.
it
said,
“you
may
not
subvert
the
employee
of
the
party
you
were
suing
to
that
purpose”.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
undercover
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
when
the
charges
originally
were
laid
against
mr.
hoffa,
the
charge
of
hiring
the
undercover
agent
was
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
orlando
was
–-
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
it
is.
mr.
orlando
was
the
undercover
agent.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
is
the
testimony
of
mr.
ruffalo
and
mr.
orlando.
i
must
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
he
was
--
let
me
go
back
to
say
that
this
was
not
a
charge
originally
made.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
he
did
but
it
wasn't
the
thing
on
(voice
overlap)
was
disbarred.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i'm
not
referring
to
that.
but
when
the
charge
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
basis
for
calling
him
an
undercover
agent
that
initially,
when
the
charges
were
brought,
there
was
no
charge
that
he
had
hired
mr.
orlando
to
investigate
cases.
the
charge
was
that
orlando
was
soliciting
lawsuits
for
him
two
charges
of
that
and
so
the
relationship
between
orlando
and
ruffalo
was
a
matter
of
critical
concern
to
the
commission.
now,
mr.
ruffalo
came
in
and
said
that,
“no,
he
is
not
soliciting
cases
for
me,”
but
testified
that
he
was
doing
something
much
worst.
he
was
in
my
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
those
charges
were,
but
there
were
other
charges
of
solicitation
that
were
sustained
by
the
commissioners
but
not
sustained
in
the
state
court.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
right.
no
such
finding
here.
but
in
explain
--
in
defending
against
that
charge,
mr.
ruffalo
testified
defense
that
we
believed
demonstrated
much
more
serious
conduct
that
ruffalo
was
investigating
cases
against
his
own
employer
and
the
commissioner
said,
“what
records
--”
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
am
trying
to,
but
i
have
to
give
your
honors,
the
background.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that's
right.
the
baltimore
&
ohio
was
the
defendant.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
it
isn't.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
he
was
asked
to
produce
his
records
to
show
this
relationship
and
he
said,
“i
don't
have
any
records."
“why?”
“i
destroyed
them,”
and
he
said
that,
“i
paid
my
other
investigators
by
check.
i
paid
mr.
ruffalo
in
cash.”
why?
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
he
is
disbarred
for
that
very
thing
for
hiring
secretly
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
has
this
to
do
with
it,
that
he
then
was
asked
why
and
he
said,
“and
this
is
what
makes
him
an
undercover
agent.”
he
said,
“we
didn't”
--
this
is
mr.
ruffalo,
“we
didn't
want
it
to
be
known
in
case
any
question
came
out
about
it
that
orlando
was
working
for
me.
we
kept
it
that
way
for
the
particular
fact
that
he
was
working
for
the
b.&
o.
railroad
and
we
didn't
want
to
get
him
involved,”
and
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
say,
is
evidenced
that
makes
him
an
undercover
agent
and
it
was
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
could
have
been
but
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
is
--
it
does
not
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
does
not
lessen
the
lawyer's
obligation
not
to
get
a
layman
into
that
kind
of
position.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i
did
not
say
that,
your
honor.
that
was
mr.
spangenberg
who
made
that
argument.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i
do
not
agree
with
it.
i
say
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
would
not
be
wrong
but
that
is
not
what
was
done
here.
here
was
a
long
course
of
employment
of
this
man,
orlando?
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
how
long?
initially,
when
the
charge
was
laid,
when
this
information
came
before
the
panel,
the
charge
was
that
you
did
this
from
1953
until
1961
and
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
and
to
that
question,
i
would
give
the
same
answer
as
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
that
if
there
was
a
wrong
on
the
part
of
this
lawyer,
as
we
believe
there
was,
it
cannot
be
excused
by
any
conduct
that
may
have
been
engaged
in
that
was
improper
by
anybody
else.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
they
were
investigating
on
the
business
of
soliciting
and
not
--
it
never
apparently
occurred
to
them
that
he
was
actually
investigating
cases
against
the
railroad
because
that
fact
never
appeared
until
mr.
ruffalo
said,
“that
is
my
defense
to
the
charge
of
solicitation.”
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
then
the
charge
was
amended
and
the
panel
made
perfectly
clear
that
he
could
have
whatever
time
he
needed
to
answer
that
charge
and
indeed
the
hearings
did
not
close
until
eight
months
later.
mr.
ruffalo's
defense
to
that
charge
was
that
it's
all
right
for
a
lawyer
to
do
that
kind
of
thing
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
permissible
of
a
lawyer.
we
say
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
i
don't
know,
and
the
record
does
not
show.but
it
does
show
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
he
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
investigated
all
the
railroad
cases.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
don't
know.
the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
that
was
disclosed
to
the
other
railroads
or
not,
so
i
am
unable
to
answer.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
oh!
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
so
long
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
subject
to
one
possible
condition.
i
think
that
it
is
wrongful
conduct
on
the
part
of
a
lawyer
to
hire
even
orlando
as
an
employee
of
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad
to
investigate
other
railroads
unless
that
is
disclosed
to
orlando's
own
employer,
that's
the
only
reservation
i
would
put
up.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no.
no,
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
record
does
not
show
the
number
he
investigated
but
it
was
admitted
by
mr.
ruffalo
frankly
that
he
did
investigate
baltimore
&
ohio
claims.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
there
are
at
least
three
that
are
mentioned
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
against
the
b.&
o.,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
record
does
not
show.
and
may
i
say,
with
respect
to
that
--
the
point
suggested
by
that
question
in
the
argument
made
by
mr.
spangenberg
that
it
seems
to
us
not
to
be
an
answer
to
say
that
this
lawyer
or
that
mike
orlando
did
not
investigate
in
any
area
where
--
which
involves
his
own
work
nor
is
it
an
answer
to
say
that
he
did
not
filch
record
from
the
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad
and
that
he
had
no
access,
that
we
say
is
beside
the
point
as
mr.
judge
edwards
who
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“the
employment
of
a
--
in
dealing
with
that
specific
argument
made
there
that
his
work
involved
no
supervisory
responsibilities.”
judge
edwards
gave
this
answer
and
i
submit
that
it
is
the
answer
this
court
ought
to
accept,
“i
cannot
avoid
concluding
that
orlando's
access
to
the
b.&
o.
property
and
personnel
would
be
of
potential
value
to
respondent
and
that
it
would
sometimes
be
impossible,
probably
even
for
orlando
to
know
when
he
was
working
for
the
railroad
and
when
he
was
investigating
for
respondent.”
now,
i
started
to
say
that
this
relationship
started
in
1953
and
when
the
charge
was
first
made,
mr.
ruffalo
said,
“i
want
you
to
amend
that
charge.”
he
had
been
subjected
to
discipline
in
the
ohio
courts
for
misconduct
in
1957
and
he
said,
this
charge
should
begin
from
1957
and
go
on
forward
and
whether
the
commission
could
have
gone
earlier
than
that,
it's
not
a
matter
of
concern
here
because
the
commission
exceeded
to
that
request
and
the
charge
was
amended,
the
charge
that
this
relationship
and
the
investigating
cases
against
his
own
employer
started
in
1957
and
continued
until
midyear
in
1961.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
of
course,
he
may.
that
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
you
--
if
that
is
what
he
is
doing,
i
think
the
lawyer
has
a
right
to
do
that
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
line
is
hiring
an
employee
as
a
regular
course
of
conduct.
and
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
for
him
to
say,
“i
want
you
to
investigate
this
case
against
the
railroad
for
me
in
this
one
instance.”
i
think
that
would
be
wrong
but
that
isn't
this
case.
but
if
he
merely
says,
“there
has
been
an
accident
on
the
railroad.
i
want
you
to
tell
me
whatever
you
know
about
it”.
that
would
be
perfectly
proper.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
if
it
were
in
the
one
case,
i
think
that
no
lawyer
would
be
disbarred
for
that.
but
when
he
embarks
on
the
course
of
conduct
that
this
lawyer
did,
then
i
say
that
he
has
violated
what
is
expected
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
he
has
--
well,
when
he
does
it
over
a
period
from
'57
to
'61.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
there
are
at
least
three
that
are
mentioned.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
there
was
no
inquiry
as
to
how
many
cases
there
were.
the
inquiries
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
--
well,
i
didn't
ask
him
because
i
wasn't
there
but
he
was
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
would
say
obviously,
they
did
not
inquire
into
that
because
in
their
view
to
hire
a
man
to
do
that
kind
of
thing,
not
go
to
him
casually
to
say,
“tell
me
about
this
accident.”
that
it
--
the
panel
believed
and
i
believe
is
incompatible
with
the
conduct
of
a
lawyer.
it
is
in
--
oh!
may
i
say,
this
continued
until
midyear
1961,
july,
when
the
baltimore
&
ohio
fired
orlando,
his
services
for
mr.
ruffalo
also
terminated
at
the
same
time.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
railroad
adjustment
board
does
not
so
view
this
practice
in
the
very
case
that
they
cite.
what
the
board
did
was
to
say
that
a
railroad
employee
may
tell
whatever
he
knows
about
an
accident
but
that,
in
that
case,
the
firing
was
proper
because
the
employee
there
took
a
stranger
onto
the
railroad
premises
and
took
a
picture
of
a
structure
that
was
involved
in
a
suit.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
he
took
a
picture
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
its
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
only
difference
is
that
there
--
was
in
the
form
of
the
information
that
was
brought
back
rather
than
by
word
of
mouth,
there
it
was
brought
back
by
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
but
what
the
board
said
in
that
very
case,
it
said
only
that
he
has
a
right
to
tell
what
he
knows
about
an
accident,
period.
and
i
say
that
cannot
be
read
to
justify
this.
next,
the
only
case
that
i
know
of
where
the
railroad
adjustment
board
held
that
an
employee
was
improperly
fired
was
a
case
where
also
the
employee
took
the
stranger
onto
the
premises,
took
a
photograph
of
a
spiral
stairway,
permitted
the
stranger
to
take
the
photograph
of
a
stairway
which
was
a
subject
of
a
lawsuit.
after
all,
that
could
be
a
more
truthful
representation
on
what
was
there
on
the
photograph
and
the
employee
said
now,
“i
wasn't
warned
and
there
was
nothing
in
this
employment
contract
that
said
i
couldn't
do
this
kind
of
thing,”
and
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
said,
“you
shouldn't
have
been
fired.”
the
court
--
district
court
reversed
that
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
or
held
that
it
was
properly
reversed
saying
in
an
opinion
mr.
judge
gilliam
said,
“what
could
he
have
done
that
would
have
been
more
detrimental
to
his
employer,
than
assuming
the
employ
--
than
assisting
the
employer's
adversary
in
litigation”
and
that
is
exactly
what
ruffalo
did
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
so
far
as
i
--
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
been
no
like
case.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
state
that
has
a
law
to
that
effect
but
i
can
give
you
a
case
that
isn't
cited
in
the
briefs
but
decided
in
rhode
island
where
the
lawyer
employed,
first
an
investigator
in
a
divorce
case
to
investigate
the
--
on
behalf
of
the
wife,
and
then
after
that
service
had
terminated,
the
lawyer
on
the
other
side,
after
a
appreciable
distance
of
time
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i
would
not
accept
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
say
that
this
lawyer
violated
the
first
duty
that
the
lawyer
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
because
i
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
and
i
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
first
statute
of
westminster
enacted
in
1275
that
says,
“that
any
sergeant
or
lawyer
who
engages
in
deception
against
not
only
the
court
but
against
the
party.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
if,
your
honor,
please,
that
statute
of
westminster
has
come
down
to
us
into
our
present
code
of
ethics,
the
canons.
canon
41
says
that
the
lawyer
owes
a
duty
not
only
to
his
client.
he
owes
a
duty
to
the
court
and
he
owes
a
duty
to
the
other
party
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
in
my
view,
there
is
a
clear
statement
in
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
--
in
the
canons.
in
canon
41
that
said
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
canon
41
plus
the
oath
that
i
heard
lawyers
take
this
morning
that
he
will
conduct
himself,
demean
himself
uprightly
and
according
to
law.
indeed
the
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
only
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
do,
your
honor.
most
sincerely,
i
do.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
think
it
is
wrong
because
of
what
i
read,
for
example,
in
the
rule
of
this
court,
“the
only
standard
this
court
lays
down
for
disbarment
is
conduct
unbecoming
a
member
of
the
profession.”
i
think
that
the
standards
that
are
established
for
the
legal
profession
by
this
court
in
its
rule,
the
same
rule
is
enjoined
upon
the
courts
of
appeal
in
the
new
rules
that
is
going
into
effect
and
by
the
decisions
of
our
own
supreme
court
where
our
court
has
held
that
any
lawyer
brings
disbarment
or
discipline
upon
himself
for
--
for
conduct
which
brings
discredit
upon
himself
or
the
courts.
now
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
think
this
lawyer
was
accorded
due
process
and
i
say
that
if
he
had
read
the
literature
on
discipline,
he
would
have
found
that
there
are
many
cases
the
country
over
where
lawyers
have
been
disciplined
even
though
there
was
no
canon
that
in
so
many
words
said
that
conduct.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
because
a
lawyer
is
expected
to
adhere
to
high
standards,
the
standards
so
high.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
they
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
against
his
own
employer
and
that,
your
honors,
we
say
is
conduct
unworthy
of
a
lawyer.
with
that,
we
submit
the
case
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
don't
like
you
getting
to
the
division
on
the
court
on
that
subjective
question
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
but
i
think
there
is.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
in
that,
as
i
read
that
opinion,
there
was
not
an
employment
of
a
person
in
the
employ
of
the
other
party.
i
did
not
understand
that
the
person
was
an
employee
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
he
was
an
officer
of
the
teamsters
union
but
i
don't
believe
that
he
was
an
employee
of
mr.
hoffa
was
the
president?
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
think
that
wrong
is
in
suborning
the
employee
of
the
party
you
are
suing.
now,
if
the
government
did
in
that
case
suborn
an
employee
of
mr.
hoffa
and
i
did
not
so
understand.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
suborn
to
corrupt
him
from
his
duty
to
his
employer.
the
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
against
his
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
he
was
suborned
from
his
duty
to
his
employer,
the
b.&
o.
the
first
duty
of
an
employee
is
loyalty
to
his
employer
and
this
court
has
so
held
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
burton
involving
the
pickets
at
the
television
station.
the
first
duty
of
the
employee
is
the
duty
of
loyalty
and
that
is
what
was
corrupted
here.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
is
the
same
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
is
the
same
kind
of
duty
as
we
impose
upon
a
trustee,
for
example,
where
we
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
we
say
that
we
will
not
permit
you
to
get
into
that
situation
where
you
may
breach
your
duty
of
loyalty.
we
will
not
permit
it
and
we
will
not
permit
a
lawyer
to
let
a
layman
get
into
that
position.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
have
no
complaint
with
that
statement.
i
say,
when
a
lawyer
goes
and
hires
a
person
to
do
that
kind
of
thing,
then
he
had
violated
his
oath
of
office.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
think
there
is
all
that
difference
in
the
world,
your
honor.
there,
you
are
asking
the
employee
to
come
and
tell
you
about
the
specific
facts
of
an
accident.
that
he
may
do.
but
i
do
say
that
the
lawyer
has
no
right
to
hire
that
employee
to
do
that
kind
of
work.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
don't
think
the
matter
of
payment
is
particularly
relevant.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
but
the
fact
that
he
enters
upon
a
course
of
conduct
and
that
a
lawyer
suborns
that
obligation
of
loyalty
and
says,
“you,
you
go
and
investigate
things
against
your
own
employer.”
that
is
the
thing
that
is
wrong
and
i
submit
that
the
conduct
of
a
lawyer's
--
if
that
is
to
be
accepted
as
a
standard
of
conduct
for
lawyers,
then
it
seems
to
me
discipline
at
the
bar
is
gone
if
there
must
be
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
statement
is
made
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
cannot
answer
it
from
the
record.i
am
told
that
the
president
have
actually
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
am
told,
outside
the
record,
that
his
firm
was
counsel
for
the
b.&
o.
but
i
understand
that
the
information
came
to
him
because
he
was
president
of
the
bar
association.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
don't
know
that
he
--
i
don't
know
that
that
he
did
participate
in
the
consideration
but
accepting
to
turned
it
over
to
the
appropriate
grievance
committee
of
the
association.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
--
i
see
that
if
the
lawyer
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i
do
not
but
if
the
lawyer
undertook
to
do
that,
then
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
my
answer
is
the
same,
your
honor.
i
say
that
if
the
lawyer,
however,
had
anything
to
do
with
developing
that
then
he
has
departed
from
what
i
hope
will
continue
to
be
the
high
standard
--
a
standard
so
high
for
lawyers
that
when
he
jumps
down
from
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
would
be
perfectly
content
to
have
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
may
it
please
the
court.
we
should
have
in
mind
what
it
is
that
john
ruffalo
was
disbarred
for.
i
can
give
that
to
the
court
most
clearly
by
quoting
to
you
what
it
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
said.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
one
who
hires
an
experienced
lawyer,
and
here
was
a
lawyer
john
ruffalo
who
had
18
years
of
experience
at
the
bar
practicing
in
youngstown,
ohio,
to
act
as
an
undercover
agent
to
obtain
evidence
and
information
for
use
in
suits
against
his
own
employer
does
not
exhibit
the
fair
character
and
the
integrity
which
must
be
the
mark
of
a
lawyer.
the
court
said,
“we
do
not
believe
we
should
say
to
today's
society
of
whom
we
ask
that
our
profession
be
held
in
high
regard
that
we
do
not
have
the
ability
to
represent
our
clients
except
through
planting
secret
agents
in
the
shops
of
those
we
call
to
account
in
the
courts.
if
this
kind
of
espionage
is
--
has
become
a
way
of
life
in
some
of
today's
business,
more
is
expected
of
a
lawyer,
then
that
they
conform
to
the
minimal
standards
of
the
marketplace.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
i
walked
to
turn
to
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
may
i
first,
before
i
answer
it,
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
disbarred
this
man
because
he
was
dishonest.
i
want
to
return
to
that
later.
i'll
now
return
to
your
question,
mr.
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
because
he
was
dishonest
and
that
point,
i
want
to
develop
later
but
first,
i
want
to
answer
the
question
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
the
dishonesty
was
enlisting
an
employee
in
the
very
camp
of
the
party
he
was
suing
to
develop
evidence
against
that
party.
no
one
is
saying
to
this
lawyer
that
he
may
not
fully
investigate
cases.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
to
this
lawyer
is
that
a
lawyer
does
not
go
into
the
camp
of
the
party
he
is
suing
and
then
list
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
your
honor,
that
--
the
united
states
did
not
quite
do
that.
in
the
hoffa
case,
if
the
evidence
had
been
presented
here,
that
in
the
hoffa
case,
the
evidence
obtained
by
the
secret
agent
was
used
in
the
test
fleet
case.
i
think
you
would
have
had
an
entirely
different
question.
but
the
court
itself
made
the
distinction
in
the
hoffa
case
that
there,
the
evidence
that
was
obtained
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
true,
but
may
i
say
to
that,
that
different
policy
considerations
to
begin
with
come
into
play
there
and
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
criminal
elements
who
do
not
regard
and
have
no
respect
for
the
law.
now,
to
apply
that
same
analogy
here,
no
one
is
saying
to
mr.
ruffalo,
that
he
may
not
employ
an
undercover
agent
if
he
wishes
to.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
but
the
court
permitted
the
use
in
the
hoffa
case
of
that
evidence
which
was
obtained
by
the
undercover
agent.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
not
in
the
--
not
in
the
test
fleet
case.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
it
was
not
used
in
that.
that
was
the
case
which
was
on
trial
and
it
was
not
used
in
that
case
and
that
was
the
distinction
that
the
court
made
in
that
case.
that
it
was
evidence
that
was
used
to
convict
for
the
attempted
jury
tampering.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
defendants
were
hoffa
and
the
others
but
it
was
not
in
the
test
flee
case
that
the
evidence
was
used.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
this
testimony
was
used
against
the
b.&
o.,
yes
but
there
is
a
difference,
we
submit
to
your
honors,
in
a
situation
that
arises
in
a
civil
case
and
one
that
arises
in
a
criminal
case,
i
think
different
standards
are
applicable,
and
i
say
to
your
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
first
is
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
criminal
problem
with
an
element
which
does
not
respect
the
law.
that
is
point
number
one
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
true
but
we
are
not
saying
to
this
man
that
he
may
not
use
an
undercover
agent,
and
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
say
that.
it
said,
“you
may
not
subvert
the
employee
of
the
party
you
were
suing
to
that
purpose”.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
undercover
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
when
the
charges
originally
were
laid
against
mr.
hoffa,
the
charge
of
hiring
the
undercover
agent
was
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
orlando
was
–-
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
it
is.
mr.
orlando
was
the
undercover
agent.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
is
the
testimony
of
mr.
ruffalo
and
mr.
orlando.
i
must
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
he
was
--
let
me
go
back
to
say
that
this
was
not
a
charge
originally
made.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
he
did
but
it
wasn't
the
thing
on
(voice
overlap)
was
disbarred.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i'm
not
referring
to
that.
but
when
the
charge
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
basis
for
calling
him
an
undercover
agent
that
initially,
when
the
charges
were
brought,
there
was
no
charge
that
he
had
hired
mr.
orlando
to
investigate
cases.
the
charge
was
that
orlando
was
soliciting
lawsuits
for
him
two
charges
of
that
and
so
the
relationship
between
orlando
and
ruffalo
was
a
matter
of
critical
concern
to
the
commission.
now,
mr.
ruffalo
came
in
and
said
that,
“no,
he
is
not
soliciting
cases
for
me,”
but
testified
that
he
was
doing
something
much
worst.
he
was
in
my
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
those
charges
were,
but
there
were
other
charges
of
solicitation
that
were
sustained
by
the
commissioners
but
not
sustained
in
the
state
court.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
right.
no
such
finding
here.
but
in
explain
--
in
defending
against
that
charge,
mr.
ruffalo
testified
defense
that
we
believed
demonstrated
much
more
serious
conduct
that
ruffalo
was
investigating
cases
against
his
own
employer
and
the
commissioner
said,
“what
records
--”
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
am
trying
to,
but
i
have
to
give
your
honors,
the
background.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that's
right.
the
baltimore
&
ohio
was
the
defendant.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
it
isn't.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
he
was
asked
to
produce
his
records
to
show
this
relationship
and
he
said,
“i
don't
have
any
records."
“why?”
“i
destroyed
them,”
and
he
said
that,
“i
paid
my
other
investigators
by
check.
i
paid
mr.
ruffalo
in
cash.”
why?
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
he
is
disbarred
for
that
very
thing
for
hiring
secretly
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
has
this
to
do
with
it,
that
he
then
was
asked
why
and
he
said,
“and
this
is
what
makes
him
an
undercover
agent.”
he
said,
“we
didn't”
--
this
is
mr.
ruffalo,
“we
didn't
want
it
to
be
known
in
case
any
question
came
out
about
it
that
orlando
was
working
for
me.
we
kept
it
that
way
for
the
particular
fact
that
he
was
working
for
the
b.&
o.
railroad
and
we
didn't
want
to
get
him
involved,”
and
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
say,
is
evidenced
that
makes
him
an
undercover
agent
and
it
was
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
could
have
been
but
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
is
--
it
does
not
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
does
not
lessen
the
lawyer's
obligation
not
to
get
a
layman
into
that
kind
of
position.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i
did
not
say
that,
your
honor.
that
was
mr.
spangenberg
who
made
that
argument.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i
do
not
agree
with
it.
i
say
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
would
not
be
wrong
but
that
is
not
what
was
done
here.
here
was
a
long
course
of
employment
of
this
man,
orlando?
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
how
long?
initially,
when
the
charge
was
laid,
when
this
information
came
before
the
panel,
the
charge
was
that
you
did
this
from
1953
until
1961
and
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
and
to
that
question,
i
would
give
the
same
answer
as
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
that
if
there
was
a
wrong
on
the
part
of
this
lawyer,
as
we
believe
there
was,
it
cannot
be
excused
by
any
conduct
that
may
have
been
engaged
in
that
was
improper
by
anybody
else.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
they
were
investigating
on
the
business
of
soliciting
and
not
--
it
never
apparently
occurred
to
them
that
he
was
actually
investigating
cases
against
the
railroad
because
that
fact
never
appeared
until
mr.
ruffalo
said,
“that
is
my
defense
to
the
charge
of
solicitation.”
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
then
the
charge
was
amended
and
the
panel
made
perfectly
clear
that
he
could
have
whatever
time
he
needed
to
answer
that
charge
and
indeed
the
hearings
did
not
close
until
eight
months
later.
mr.
ruffalo's
defense
to
that
charge
was
that
it's
all
right
for
a
lawyer
to
do
that
kind
of
thing
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
permissible
of
a
lawyer.
we
say
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
i
don't
know,
and
the
record
does
not
show.but
it
does
show
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
he
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
investigated
all
the
railroad
cases.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
don't
know.
the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
that
was
disclosed
to
the
other
railroads
or
not,
so
i
am
unable
to
answer.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
oh!
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
so
long
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
subject
to
one
possible
condition.
i
think
that
it
is
wrongful
conduct
on
the
part
of
a
lawyer
to
hire
even
orlando
as
an
employee
of
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad
to
investigate
other
railroads
unless
that
is
disclosed
to
orlando's
own
employer,
that's
the
only
reservation
i
would
put
up.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no.
no,
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
record
does
not
show
the
number
he
investigated
but
it
was
admitted
by
mr.
ruffalo
frankly
that
he
did
investigate
baltimore
&
ohio
claims.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
there
are
at
least
three
that
are
mentioned
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
against
the
b.&
o.,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
record
does
not
show.
and
may
i
say,
with
respect
to
that
--
the
point
suggested
by
that
question
in
the
argument
made
by
mr.
spangenberg
that
it
seems
to
us
not
to
be
an
answer
to
say
that
this
lawyer
or
that
mike
orlando
did
not
investigate
in
any
area
where
--
which
involves
his
own
work
nor
is
it
an
answer
to
say
that
he
did
not
filch
record
from
the
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad
and
that
he
had
no
access,
that
we
say
is
beside
the
point
as
mr.
judge
edwards
who
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“the
employment
of
a
--
in
dealing
with
that
specific
argument
made
there
that
his
work
involved
no
supervisory
responsibilities.”
judge
edwards
gave
this
answer
and
i
submit
that
it
is
the
answer
this
court
ought
to
accept,
“i
cannot
avoid
concluding
that
orlando's
access
to
the
b.&
o.
property
and
personnel
would
be
of
potential
value
to
respondent
and
that
it
would
sometimes
be
impossible,
probably
even
for
orlando
to
know
when
he
was
working
for
the
railroad
and
when
he
was
investigating
for
respondent.”
now,
i
started
to
say
that
this
relationship
started
in
1953
and
when
the
charge
was
first
made,
mr.
ruffalo
said,
“i
want
you
to
amend
that
charge.”
he
had
been
subjected
to
discipline
in
the
ohio
courts
for
misconduct
in
1957
and
he
said,
this
charge
should
begin
from
1957
and
go
on
forward
and
whether
the
commission
could
have
gone
earlier
than
that,
it's
not
a
matter
of
concern
here
because
the
commission
exceeded
to
that
request
and
the
charge
was
amended,
the
charge
that
this
relationship
and
the
investigating
cases
against
his
own
employer
started
in
1957
and
continued
until
midyear
in
1961.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
of
course,
he
may.
that
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
you
--
if
that
is
what
he
is
doing,
i
think
the
lawyer
has
a
right
to
do
that
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
line
is
hiring
an
employee
as
a
regular
course
of
conduct.
and
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
for
him
to
say,
“i
want
you
to
investigate
this
case
against
the
railroad
for
me
in
this
one
instance.”
i
think
that
would
be
wrong
but
that
isn't
this
case.
but
if
he
merely
says,
“there
has
been
an
accident
on
the
railroad.
i
want
you
to
tell
me
whatever
you
know
about
it”.
that
would
be
perfectly
proper.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
if
it
were
in
the
one
case,
i
think
that
no
lawyer
would
be
disbarred
for
that.
but
when
he
embarks
on
the
course
of
conduct
that
this
lawyer
did,
then
i
say
that
he
has
violated
what
is
expected
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
he
has
--
well,
when
he
does
it
over
a
period
from
'57
to
'61.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
there
are
at
least
three
that
are
mentioned.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
there
was
no
inquiry
as
to
how
many
cases
there
were.
the
inquiries
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
--
well,
i
didn't
ask
him
because
i
wasn't
there
but
he
was
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
would
say
obviously,
they
did
not
inquire
into
that
because
in
their
view
to
hire
a
man
to
do
that
kind
of
thing,
not
go
to
him
casually
to
say,
“tell
me
about
this
accident.”
that
it
--
the
panel
believed
and
i
believe
is
incompatible
with
the
conduct
of
a
lawyer.
it
is
in
--
oh!
may
i
say,
this
continued
until
midyear
1961,
july,
when
the
baltimore
&
ohio
fired
orlando,
his
services
for
mr.
ruffalo
also
terminated
at
the
same
time.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
railroad
adjustment
board
does
not
so
view
this
practice
in
the
very
case
that
they
cite.
what
the
board
did
was
to
say
that
a
railroad
employee
may
tell
whatever
he
knows
about
an
accident
but
that,
in
that
case,
the
firing
was
proper
because
the
employee
there
took
a
stranger
onto
the
railroad
premises
and
took
a
picture
of
a
structure
that
was
involved
in
a
suit.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
he
took
a
picture
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
its
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
only
difference
is
that
there
--
was
in
the
form
of
the
information
that
was
brought
back
rather
than
by
word
of
mouth,
there
it
was
brought
back
by
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
but
what
the
board
said
in
that
very
case,
it
said
only
that
he
has
a
right
to
tell
what
he
knows
about
an
accident,
period.
and
i
say
that
cannot
be
read
to
justify
this.
next,
the
only
case
that
i
know
of
where
the
railroad
adjustment
board
held
that
an
employee
was
improperly
fired
was
a
case
where
also
the
employee
took
the
stranger
onto
the
premises,
took
a
photograph
of
a
spiral
stairway,
permitted
the
stranger
to
take
the
photograph
of
a
stairway
which
was
a
subject
of
a
lawsuit.
after
all,
that
could
be
a
more
truthful
representation
on
what
was
there
on
the
photograph
and
the
employee
said
now,
“i
wasn't
warned
and
there
was
nothing
in
this
employment
contract
that
said
i
couldn't
do
this
kind
of
thing,”
and
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
said,
“you
shouldn't
have
been
fired.”
the
court
--
district
court
reversed
that
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
or
held
that
it
was
properly
reversed
saying
in
an
opinion
mr.
judge
gilliam
said,
“what
could
he
have
done
that
would
have
been
more
detrimental
to
his
employer,
than
assuming
the
employ
--
than
assisting
the
employer's
adversary
in
litigation”
and
that
is
exactly
what
ruffalo
did
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
so
far
as
i
--
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
been
no
like
case.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
state
that
has
a
law
to
that
effect
but
i
can
give
you
a
case
that
isn't
cited
in
the
briefs
but
decided
in
rhode
island
where
the
lawyer
employed,
first
an
investigator
in
a
divorce
case
to
investigate
the
--
on
behalf
of
the
wife,
and
then
after
that
service
had
terminated,
the
lawyer
on
the
other
side,
after
a
appreciable
distance
of
time
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i
would
not
accept
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
say
that
this
lawyer
violated
the
first
duty
that
the
lawyer
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
because
i
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
and
i
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
first
statute
of
westminster
enacted
in
1275
that
says,
“that
any
sergeant
or
lawyer
who
engages
in
deception
against
not
only
the
court
but
against
the
party.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
if,
your
honor,
please,
that
statute
of
westminster
has
come
down
to
us
into
our
present
code
of
ethics,
the
canons.
canon
41
says
that
the
lawyer
owes
a
duty
not
only
to
his
client.
he
owes
a
duty
to
the
court
and
he
owes
a
duty
to
the
other
party
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
in
my
view,
there
is
a
clear
statement
in
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
--
in
the
canons.
in
canon
41
that
said
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
canon
41
plus
the
oath
that
i
heard
lawyers
take
this
morning
that
he
will
conduct
himself,
demean
himself
uprightly
and
according
to
law.
indeed
the
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
the
only
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
do,
your
honor.
most
sincerely,
i
do.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
think
it
is
wrong
because
of
what
i
read,
for
example,
in
the
rule
of
this
court,
“the
only
standard
this
court
lays
down
for
disbarment
is
conduct
unbecoming
a
member
of
the
profession.”
i
think
that
the
standards
that
are
established
for
the
legal
profession
by
this
court
in
its
rule,
the
same
rule
is
enjoined
upon
the
courts
of
appeal
in
the
new
rules
that
is
going
into
effect
and
by
the
decisions
of
our
own
supreme
court
where
our
court
has
held
that
any
lawyer
brings
disbarment
or
discipline
upon
himself
for
--
for
conduct
which
brings
discredit
upon
himself
or
the
courts.
now
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
think
this
lawyer
was
accorded
due
process
and
i
say
that
if
he
had
read
the
literature
on
discipline,
he
would
have
found
that
there
are
many
cases
the
country
over
where
lawyers
have
been
disciplined
even
though
there
was
no
canon
that
in
so
many
words
said
that
conduct.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
because
a
lawyer
is
expected
to
adhere
to
high
standards,
the
standards
so
high.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
they
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
against
his
own
employer
and
that,
your
honors,
we
say
is
conduct
unworthy
of
a
lawyer.
with
that,
we
submit
the
case
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
don't
like
you
getting
to
the
division
on
the
court
on
that
subjective
question
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
but
i
think
there
is.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
in
that,
as
i
read
that
opinion,
there
was
not
an
employment
of
a
person
in
the
employ
of
the
other
party.
i
did
not
understand
that
the
person
was
an
employee
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
he
was
an
officer
of
the
teamsters
union
but
i
don't
believe
that
he
was
an
employee
of
mr.
hoffa
was
the
president?
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
think
that
wrong
is
in
suborning
the
employee
of
the
party
you
are
suing.
now,
if
the
government
did
in
that
case
suborn
an
employee
of
mr.
hoffa
and
i
did
not
so
understand.
mr.
thomas

against
his
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
he
was
suborned
from
his
duty
to
his
employer,
the
b.&
o.
the
first
duty
of
an
employee
is
loyalty
to
his
employer
and
this
court
has
so
held
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
burton
involving
the
pickets
at
the
television
station.
the
first
duty
of
the
employee
is
the
duty
of
loyalty
and
that
is
what
was
corrupted
here.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
is
the
same
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
is
the
same
kind
of
duty
as
we
impose
upon
a
trustee,
for
example,
where
we
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
we
say
that
we
will
not
permit
you
to
get
into
that
situation
where
you
may
breach
your
duty
of
loyalty.
we
will
not
permit
it
and
we
will
not
permit
a
lawyer
to
let
a
layman
get
into
that
position.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
have
no
complaint
with
that
statement.
i
say,
when
a
lawyer
goes
and
hires
a
person
to
do
that
kind
of
thing,
then
he
had
violated
his
oath
of
office.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
think
there
is
all
that
difference
in
the
world,
your
honor.
there,
you
are
asking
the
employee
to
come
and
tell
you
about
the
specific
facts
of
an
accident.
that
he
may
do.
but
i
do
say
that
the
lawyer
has
no
right
to
hire
that
employee
to
do
that
kind
of
work.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
don't
think
the
matter
of
payment
is
particularly
relevant.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
but
the
fact
that
he
enters
upon
a
course
of
conduct
and
that
a
lawyer
suborns
that
obligation
of
loyalty
and
says,
“you,
you
go
and
investigate
things
against
your
own
employer.”
that
is
the
thing
that
is
wrong
and
i
submit
that
the
conduct
of
a
lawyer's
--
if
that
is
to
be
accepted
as
a
standard
of
conduct
for
lawyers,
then
it
seems
to
me
discipline
at
the
bar
is
gone
if
there
must
be
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
statement
is
made
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
cannot
answer
it
from
the
record.i
am
told
that
the
president
have
actually
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
am
told,
outside
the
record,
that
his
firm
was
counsel
for
the
b.&
o.
but
i
understand
that
the
information
came
to
him
because
he
was
president
of
the
bar
association.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
don't
know
that
he
--
i
don't
know
that
that
he
did
participate
in
the
consideration
but
accepting
to
turned
it
over
to
the
appropriate
grievance
committee
of
the
association.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
--
i
see
that
if
the
lawyer
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
i
do
not
but
if
the
lawyer
undertook
to
do
that,
then
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
my
answer
is
the
same,
your
honor.
i
say
that
if
the
lawyer,
however,
had
anything
to
do
with
developing
that
then
he
has
departed
from
what
i
hope
will
continue
to
be
the
high
standard
--
a
standard
so
high
for
lawyers
that
when
he
jumps
down
from
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
would
be
perfectly
content
to
have
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
thank
you,
your
honors.
