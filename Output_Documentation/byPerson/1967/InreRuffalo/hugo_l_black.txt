one
or

questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
law
passed
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
ohio
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
ever
been
any
attempt
to
get
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
ever
held
before
that
a
man
could
be
disbarred
on
this
showing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
asking
if
there's
been
any
like
it.
what
i'm
asking
you
is
have
they
ever
done
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
ever
disbarred
a
man
on
a
showing
like
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
have
you
investigated
other
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
states
have
a
law
that
makes
this
a
cause
for
disbarment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
don't
think
that's
like
this
case,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
you
have
is,
you
keep
saying
he
violated
something
and
he
did
something
wrong.
what
you
have
is
a
situation
in
which
the
policy-making
body
of
your
state
has
never
outlawed
it,
your
court
has
never
outlawed
it.
the
bar
association
has
never
outlawed
it
and
nobody
else
has
ever
outlawed
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh!
where
could
you
say
it's
outlawed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
because
you
think
it's
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
because
you
think
it's
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
law
book
do
you
have
that
says
it's
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
citing
the
statute
of
westminster
in
order
to
justify
disbarring
a
man
in
1968
in
ohio
which
has
no
law
against
what
he
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
any
man
ought
to
be
disbarred
or
any
man
ought
to
be
prosecuted
and
convicted
of
a
crime
where
there
has
been
no
clear
legal
statement
made
in
advance
that
that
is
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you're
relying
on,
canon

that's
right.
but
isn't
he
entitled
to
know
what
the
law
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
don't
claim
that
anybody
could
have
known
this
was
against
the
law
in
ohio,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
because
you
think
it's
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
home
owner
could
have
his
home
taken
away
from
him
by
statement
that
he
had
done
something
which
the
law
did
not
forbid?
justice
hugo
l.
black

i
do
not.
we
are

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
due
process
to
protect
his
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
his
lifeblood
in
the
law
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other

he
had
been
disciplined

was
against

in
a
lawyer
hiring
somebody
to
do
get
some
evidence
for
him,

disbarred
for
that?
