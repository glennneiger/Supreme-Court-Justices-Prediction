mr.
koykka,
you've
got
now
--
you've
got
two
justices
that
would
like
for
you
to
explain
what
do
you
mean
by
undercover,
there
are
two
of
us
who
now
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
(voice
overlap)
undercover
agent
--
and
you
said
that
orlando
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
was
an
undercover
agent.
is
that
your
language?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
there
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
was
an
undercover
agent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
it
was
a
secret.
that
it
was
a
secret
that
he
was
representing
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
simply
that
he
didn't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
orlando
didn't
want
to
get
fired?
couldn't
that
be
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
illegal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
illegal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
kind
of
a
position
is
it?
is
--
could
orlando
--
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
it
would
be
all
right
if
orlando
had
volunteered
to
do
this
and
have
done
it
for
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
assume
that
you
agree
with
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
if
an
employee
of
a
railroad
comes
into
a
lawyer's
office
and
says,
“i'm
willing
to
give
you
information.
not
confidential
but
i'm
willing
to
give
you
information
as
to
how
an
airbrake
works,”
would
that
be
wrong
to
the
lawyer
to
take
that
information?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
had
the
association
of
the
railroad
had
been
investigating
orlando?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is,
that
if
the
association
of
railroads
had
been
investigating
orlando
and
ruffalo,
let's
say
five
or
more
years,
well
at
least
during
that
period,
orlando
wouldn't
have
been
a
“secret”
agent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
you
amended
the
charges?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
duty,
the
level
of
duty
of
loyalty
of
a
man
that
checks
airbrakes
on
cars
in
b.&
o.
railroad?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
be
his
loyalty
be
to
a
good
workman
like
job
on
an
airbrake,
period?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
position.
thank
you.
