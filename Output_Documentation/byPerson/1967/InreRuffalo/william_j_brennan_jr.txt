justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
that
at
the
ground
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
spangenberg?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
that
there's
nothing
--
no
matter
what
the
outcome
of
this
case,
even
favorable
to
your
client
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
the
outcome
of
this
case
is
in
favor
of
your
client,
this
is
not
going
to
help
him,
is
it?
the
disbarment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
they
may
be
brought
also
in
the
state
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
point
is,
the
only
point
i'm
making
is,
i
don't
quite
see
the
relevance
or
the
bases
upon
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
acted
here.
if
we
agree
with
you
that
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
we
might
reverse
here
even
though
we
might
think
that
the
ohio's
supreme
court's
basis
was
supportable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what's
the
basis
--
to
what
power
of
review
are
you
appealing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
on
what
grounds,
supervisory
power
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
the
general
power
of
the
court,
to
supervise
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
is
the
--
then
on
the
merits
of
any
disbarment
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
your
suggestion
is
that
we
may
what?
reconsider
the
record
de
novo
and
to
say
they
are
or
not
wrong
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
something
of
--
a
rather
large
autonomous
discretion,
isn't
there,
in
matters
of
disbarment
in
the
courts
that
have
that
function?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
mr.
ruffalo
member
of
this
bar?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
if
we
affirm
here,
we
then
have
to
contemplate
proceedings
to
disbar
him
here,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose,
you
mean
in
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
reached
its
conclusion
based
upon
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
did,
are
you
arguing
that
because
he
was
denied
due
process
as
you
submit
in
the
state
proceeding,
then
necessarily,
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
have
relied
upon
the
state
judgment
in
any
respect,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kokkka,
what's
the
reference
to
undercover
and
secret
--
what
is
the
evidence
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right,
now
why
is
that
undercover
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
so
far,
your
whole
emphasis
is
that
he
was
investigating
cases
which
were
mr.
ruffalo's
office
and
which
his
employer
was
the
defendant.
that's
what
you
told
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
all
there
is
to
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
he
also
an
--
in
your
submission,
was
orlando
an
undercover
agent
as
against
all
the
other
railroads
for
whom
he
investigated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
it
show
that
he
did
the
same
kind
of
work?
i
understood
from
mr.
spangenberg
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
investigated
all
the
railroads.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
against
all
railroads,
yes.
was
he
an
undercover
agent
as
to
those
other
railroads?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
times
does
he
have
to
do
it,
the
course
of
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
many
cases
against
the
b.&
o.
does
this
record
show
orlando
helped
investigate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
suborn
in
the
sense
of
having
him
falsify
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
are
you
using
suborn?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
--
all
as
i
understood
that
that's
involved
here
is
that
orlando
investigated
the
facts
regarding
cases
against
b.&
o.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right!
is
there
any
suggestion
that
he
falsified
anything
he
found?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
i
don't
know
that
suborn
is
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
koykka,
may
i
ask
you
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
statement
under
your
adversaries'
brief
accurate?
“a
very
few
former
discreditable
clients
may
claim
some
impropriety
which
the
american
association
of
railroads
then
turned
over
to
the
president
of
the
mahoning
county
bar
association,
who
was
also
the
defense
counsel
in
the
youngstown
area
for
the
b.&
o.
railroad.
the
mahoning
county
bar
association
then
filed
a
charge
against
the
petitioner,”
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
he
the
original
counsel
of
the
b.&
o.
railroad
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
didn't
think
that
his
relationship
with
the
b.&
o.
required
him
to
disqualify
himself
from
the
consideration
of
the
matter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
a
concession
too,
mr.
spangenberg
if
we
sustain
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
taken
to
disbar
him,
you
concede
that
that
also
would
be
sufficient
ground
to
disbar
him
in
this
court?
