then
so
far
as
the
relationship
between
employer
and
employee
is
concerned,
would
it
made
any
difference
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
if
there
are
no
money
in
past
hence?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
payment
makes
it
involuntary?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
they
are
concerned,
an
employee
of
a
company
is
certainly
free
to
volunteer
information
to
an
attorney
who
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
suing
the
railroad
on
account
of
injuries
to
a
fellow
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
talking
of
--
are
you
saying
that
the
due
process
question
is
involved
in
the
ohio
judgment
or
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
should
you
confine
your
argument
to
due
process
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
he
actually
transported
witnesses
to
the
court
during
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

do
that,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that's
the
trouble
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
you
were
not
referring
to
orlando.
i
would
suppose
you
would
before
you
call
him
in
an
undercover
agent.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
going
to
draw
a
line
then
between
the
continuous
course
of
dealing
with
an
employee
because
i
don't
suppose
you
would
deny
that
a
lawyer
in
investigating
his
client's
case
may
call
on
fellow
employees
and
a
fellow
employee
may
give
him
as
much
information
as
he
has
about
the
accident.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let's
assume
–-
let's
assume
that
that
lawyer
constantly
goes
to
a
particular
foreman,
a
yard
foreman
where
almost
these
accidents
occur,
the
yard
foreman
readily
and
voluntarily
gives
in
all
the
information
he
had.
a
lawyer
must
be
able
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
line
you
draw?
justice
byron
r.
white
should
we
say
the
yard
foreman
--
if
the
yard
foreman
says
to
him,
“sorry,
i
don't
know
anything
about
that,”
and
the
lawyer
said,
“well,
could
you
please
find
out
about
it
for
me
and
tell
me
whom
i
may
talk
to.”
and
that
yard
foreman
investigates
and
calls
him
up
the
next
night
and
says,
“the
fellows
who
really
know
about
this
are
john
and
jack
and
they
tell
me
this,”
and
that's
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
you
disagree
with
the
other
side
of
saying
that
the
railroad
adjustment
board
views
this
practice
as
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
firing.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
different
too,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
different
from
just
getting
information
from
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
investigation,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
railroad
adjustment
board
cases
that
sustain
firings
on
facts
like
these?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
so
far
as
the
relationship
between
employer
and
employee
is
concerned,
would
it
made
any
difference
to
the
supreme
court
of
