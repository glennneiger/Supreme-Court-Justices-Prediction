justice

fortas
but
isn't
there
a
narrow
point
here
which
is
--
that
is
alleged
in
a
way
as
i
understand
it,
that
orlando
for
a
pay
advised
mr.
ruffalo
with
respect
to
cases
against
orlando's
employer.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
raises
a
real
problem,
doesn't
it,
whether
or
not
it's
grounds
for
disbarment
that
does
ordinary
practicing
lawyers
mind,
that
would
raise
a
real
problem,
wouldn't
it,
mr.
spangenberg?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
think
it's
all
right
for
lawyer,
i
don't
want
to
personally
any
of
these
questions,
would
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
for
a
lawyer
having
a
case
against
the
b.&
o.
railroad
who
calls
some
employee
of
the
b.&
o.
for
advice
or
assistance?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
but
weren't
those
charges
of
solicitation
dismissed?
justice
abe
fortas
all
right
but
however
that
may
be,
as
the
matter
now
stands,
there
is
no
finding
that
any
--
before
us,
that
orlando
or
anybody
else
are
not
authorized
to
do
so,
not
properly
authorized
to
do
so
solicited
business
for
ruffalo,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
was
the
evidence
of
dishonesty?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
a
lawyer
would
have
to
disclose
to
the
other
railroads
that
he
had
an
outside
investigator
and
give
him
the
name?
justice
abe
fortas
wait,
just
a
minute.
you're
not
suggesting
that
there
was
anything
improper
about
employing
orlando
for
purposes
of
investigating
railroads,
other
than
accidents
on
railroads
other
than
b.&
o.?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
quite
a
doctrine.
do
the
courts
below
adopt
that
doctrine?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
--
in
how
many
instances
according
to
the
record
did
orlando
investigate
claims
against
the
b.&
o.,
his
employer?
justice
abe
fortas
the
records
didn't
show
there
was
one
or
a
hundred.
justice
abe
fortas
against
the
b.&
o.?
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
those
relate
to
the
area
of
mr.
orlando's
own
employment
for
the
b.&
o.'s?
does
the
record
show?
justice
abe
fortas
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
your
time
has
expired
but
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
to
explore
the
perimeter
of
this
doctrine
that
you're
stating.
suppose
a
lawyer's
client
--
suppose
a
lawyer
works
for
an
industrial
company
in
ohio
and
the
president
of
the
company
comes
to
him
and
says,
“you
know,
we
have
some
litigation
against
company
x
and
i
paid
a
thousand
dollars
to
one
of
the
employees
of
company
x
that
came
to
us.
he
came
to
us
voluntarily
on
his
own
initiative
and
he
gave
us
some
information
that's
useful
in
that
litigation
and
the
lawyer
proceeds
to
use
that
information
in
the
litigation.
would
the
doctrine
that
you
are
here
stating
extend
to
disbarment
of
that
lawyer?
in
other
words,
the
lawyer
knowingly
uses
in
litigation
information
that
has
been
supplied
at
the
initiative
of
an
employee
of
the
adversary
in
litigation
and
for
which
that
employee
has
been
paid.
justice
abe
fortas
you
dont
think
the
lawyer
would
be
subject
to
disbarment?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
a
lawyer
uses
it
with
full
knowledge
and
the
illustration
i
gave
--
if
the
lawyer
uses
that
information
with
full
knowledge
of
how
it's
been
obtained,
your
answer's
the
same?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice

you
wouldn't
like
to
see
that
high
standard
elevated
a
little
higher
in
the

i
put.
