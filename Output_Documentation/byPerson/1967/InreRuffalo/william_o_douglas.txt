justice
william
o.
douglas
counsel,
that's
what
the
united
states
did
in
the
hoffa
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
wasn't
talking
about
that.
i'm
just
talking
about
the
situation,
the
practice
at
present.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
if
we
have
a
constitutional
question,
i
wouldn't
think
it
would
turn
whether
the
man
is
a
rascal,
or
a
crook,
a
churchman,
or
a
fine
and
outstanding
citizen,
because
all
the
constitution
says,
“any
person.”
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
he
was
--
i
understood
he
was
not
an
employee
of
hoffa
but
the
evidence
was
not
used
to
convict
hoffa.
it
was
used
to
convict
the
person
who
sought
to
influence
the
jury.
it
was
not
used
in
the
prosecution
of
the
criminal
case
against
hoffa.
it's
an
entirely
different
situation,
if
your
honor,
please.
