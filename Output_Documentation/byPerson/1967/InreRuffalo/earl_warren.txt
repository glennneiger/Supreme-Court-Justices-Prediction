did
i
understand
that
you
say
that
never
in

have
they
reinstated
a
man
who
was
suspended

years.
chief

what
was
their
decision
on

issue?
chief

earl

there
is
no
due
process
question
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
not
questioning.
what
i
understood
you
to
answer
justice
brennan,
that
it
was
just
our
supervisory
power
that
was
involved.
chief

but
there
is
a
due

question
here?
chief

mr.
koykka?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
was
the
dishonesty
this
one
that
you're
making
a
point
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
an
employee
of
hoffa.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
this
--
the
testimony
of
this
employee
of
the
teamsters
union
was
not
used
in
the
hoffa
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
criminal
case
against
hoffa?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
were
the
defendants?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
about
if
it's
used
against
hoffa
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
this
testimony
was
used
against
the
b.&
o.?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
difference
in
ethics
is
there
between
the
criminal
and
the
civil
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
were
charged,
who
were
not
necessarily
guilty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
seven
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
you
ask
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
--
why
didn't
those
who
were
prosecuting
asked
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
koykka,
you
made
this
an
important
issue
in
your
case,
the
fact
that
this
lawyer
had
failed
to
use
a
customary
practice
in
paying
this
employee
that
he
paid
the
others
by
check
and
he
paid
this
one
in
cash
so
that
other
people
would
know
it.
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
the
employment
by
the
government
of
partin
in
the
hoffa
case
where
they
use
every
kind
of
circumvention
they
could
think
of
to
prevent
anybody
from
knowing
that
public
funds
were
expended
for
this
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
you
don't
have
to
get
the
division
just
to
answer
my
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
partin
an
employee
of
the
teamsters
union
of
which
mr.
hoffa
was
the
president?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
if
he
had
been
that
the
government
would
have
been
guilty
of
the
same
kind
of
misconduct
and
immorality
that
occurred
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
do
at
this
language
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
where
it
says,
“on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
of
the
right
of
an
employee
when
off
duty
to
assist
an
injured
employee
or
his
representative
in
any
manner
including
the
gathering
of
evidence
and
so
long
as
it
is
limited
to
the
development
of
truth,
it
cannot
be
regarded
as
disloyalty
nor
afford
just
grounds
for
discharge.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
get
any
authority
for
saying
there
is
a
difference
between
doing
this
specifically
on
one
hand
and
paying
him
for
his
time
when
he's
off
duty
on
the
other?
chief
