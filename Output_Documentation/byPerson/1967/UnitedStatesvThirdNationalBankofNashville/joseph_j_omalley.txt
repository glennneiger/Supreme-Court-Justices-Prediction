mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
convenience
and
needs
feature
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
but
first,
i
would
like
to
note
that
a
new
element
has
been
introduced
into
that
act
by
the
argument
of
the
department
of
justice,
the
question
of
the
alternative
purchaser.
there
is
first
of
all,
a
recognition
in
the
bank
merger
act
by
its
very
terms
that
two
sound
banks
in
substantial
competition
with
each
other
can
be
merged
out
of
exists
--
merged
into
one,
if
the
convenience
and
needs
of
a
community
clearly
outweigh
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
that
merger.
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
clearly
demonstrates
that
congress
felt
that
a
floundering
bank
or
a
stagnant
bank
such
as
we
had
in
the
national
bank
and
trust
company
was
covered
by
the
act,
without
question.
certainly
the
failing
bank
was
not
the
intend
of
congress
because
section
6
of
the
act
provides
that
the
agency
may
merge
out
the
failing
bank
without
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general,
without
an
advisory
report,
and
as
far
as
prosecution
for
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
upon
the
consummation
of
such
merger
which
can
be
immediate.
so
that
the
convenience
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
it's
on
page
38
of
the
appellant's
brief.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
starting
with
the
last
sentence
on
page
37,
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
now
the
conclusion
of
that
sentence
in
regard
to
7
(a),
the
next
paragraph,
and
it
states
that
the
action
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws
arising
out
of
a
merger
transaction,
shall
be
commenced
prior
to
the
earliest
time
under
paragraph
6,
at
which
a
merger
transaction
approved
under
paragraph
5
might
be
consummated.
so
that
there
is
no
time
between
the
approval
and
the
time
it
might
be
consummated.
so
this
--
the
failing
bank,
the
statement
carried
in
section
6
and
section
7,
it's
not
applicable,
section
5
is
not
applicable
in
any
sense
of
the
word
for
the
failing
bank
so
two
sound
can
banks
can
merge.
now
the
banking
agencies
have
considered
convenience
and
needs
in
three
different
areas
in
the
chartering
of
new
banks
and
the
approval
of
branches
to
existing
banks,
and
then
the
mergers
or
consolidations
of
the
existing
banks.
the
convenience
and
needs
has
never
been
defined
by
statute
and
to
my
knowledge
never
by
a
case
settled
by
this
court.
so
we
have
to
look
to
those
statutes
that
a
bank
regulatory
agency
considers
preferably
in
this
case
in
the
charter
with
the
new
bank
because
they
are
similar
to
those
used
in
the
approval
of
the
merger.
first,
is
the
new
bank
needed
by
the
community.
will
it
be
a
sound
bank?
do
the
proposers
of
this
bank
have
a
good
management
team?
will
they
be
able
to
serve
the
community
in
the
primary
function
of
a
bank
particularly
a
commercial
bank
or
it
would
be
able
to
lend
money
in
a
way
that
it's
going
to
benefit
the
economy
of
the
community,
without
money
by
supporting
marketing
capital
to
industries,
create
jobs,
expand
plans,
and
in
otherwise
contribute
to
the
betterment
of
the
people
whom
that
bank
serves.
this
is
the
one
fact
and
now
another
factor
in
convenience
and
needs
is
competition.
is
there
enough
competition
in
a
town
or
in
area
among
banks,
or
among
other
financial
institution
if
that
maybe
the
case?
would
the
addition
of
a
new
competitive
entity
injure
the
existing
competition?
and
in
a
merger,
where
the
removal
of
a
competitive
entity
help
competition
which
can
be
done
and
the
record
in
this
case
is
uncontradicted.
the
competition
among
banks
and
financial
institutions
in
nashville
has
been
greater
since
this
merger
than
before
the
merger.
even
the
appellant's
own
witness,
an
economist,
testified
that
this
was
a
probable
consequence
of
this
particular
merger.
i
think
we
might
best
apply
the
convenience
and
needs
test
to
this
particular
merger
by
asking
ourselves
some
questions.
first,
the
sole
of
the
trust
company
was
exposed
during
the
course
of
this
trial
by
the
introduction
of
examiner
reports,
it's
our
confidential,
unfortunately,
the
bank
was
out
of
existence
at
the
time
the
trial
took
place
or
it
probably
would
have
destroyed
the
public
confidence
in
the
bank
anyway.
by
the
introduction
of
these
examiner's
reports,
the
internal
weaknesses
of
the
bank,
the
poor
condition
of
its
own
portfolio,
the
deficiencies
in
its
management,
the
default
and
its
service
to
the
community,
and
its
acquiescence,
indeed
of
violations
of
the
law
in
the
administration
of
trust,
things
that
were
formally
only
known
to
the
bank
law
officers
and
to
the
examining
agency,
which
is
not
a
contour
of
the
currency
of
the
ftic
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
public
and
this
is
known
in
national
tennessee,
because
it
received
great
covers
in
that
city.
so
i
consider
the
bank
in
that
condition
where
everyone
knowing
what
it
is,
if
the
status
quo
were
returned,
as
an
employee
now
who
worked
for
third
national
bank,
would
you
want
to
go
to
the
national
bank
and
trust
company,
at
a
salary
which
is
lowest
in
the
city
and
below
the
poverty
level
which
is
cut
if
government
recognizes
in
its
economic
opportunity
programs.
every
employee
of
national
bank
and
trust
receives
an
increase
in
salary
subsequent
to
the
merger
with
third
national
bank.
there
are
long-term
division
heads.
there's
no
promotional
opportunity,
no
assurance
of
a
pension.
there
is
no
funded
pension
plan
and
this
is
a
regulatory
problem
for
40%
of
our
nation's
banks
have
no
fund
of
pension
plans.
as
an
officer,
you
have
not
given
any
responsibilities
by
this
bank.
while
officer
kirby
primm,
who
was
acknowledge
by
both,
i
should
say
the
three
sides
in
this
particular
case,
who
was
acknowledge
as
being
the
outstanding
business
development
officer
had
its
salary
increase
only
45%
in
10
years.
and
upon
leaving
this
bank
to
go
to
the
largest
bank
in
town,
had
an
increase
immediately
60%,
showing
how
far
out
of
scale,
the
officer's
salary
of
this
bank
were.
as
mr.
henry
stated,
it
had
been
18
years
since
the
department
head
have
been
changed
and
no
college
graduates
were
hired.
there
was
just
no
opportunity
for
advancement
at
all,
and
the
officer
salaries
again
where
the
law
is
entailed.
moreover
they
did
not
have
the
tools
to
go
out
and
get
business.
their
new
business
development
officer
testified
that
they
did
because
of
their
lack
of
automation,
their
lack
of
a
computer,
things
of
that
sort,
lack
of
branches.
they
were
not
able
to
go
out
and
service
the
industries
in
the
national
area.
and
that
includes
a
lot
of
comings
around
national,
and
there
was
no
leadership
in
the
bank.
as
a
depositor,
knowing
the
condition
of
this
bank,
would
you
entrust
the
sum
of
money
of
your
own
over
and
above
the
amount
ensured
by
the
ftic
to
the
management
of
this
type
of
individual
who
had
this
bank?
as
a
businessman,
needing
the
financial
expertise
of
a
bank,
would
you
entrust
your
business
and
financial
requirements
to
a
bank
that
had
no
loan
officer
competent
to
handle
the
--
or
supervise
either
the
making
or
the
employment
of
funds
or
the
collection
of
funds?
they're
unable
to
service
a
$500,000
credit
from
an
admittedly
credit
worthy
mortgage
broker
in
nashville,
and
had
to
go
out
to
the
larger
bank
in
town
to
get
the
assistance
to
do
it.
this
bank
was
just
not
competing
in
the
commercial
field
at
all
and
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
it
was.
as
a
community
leader,
the
recreation
of
this
bank
would
result
in
the
removal,
assuming
that
law
policies
to
be
the
same
as
they
were
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
would
result
in
the
removal
of
$30
million
of
commercial
funds
available
to
the
industries
of
that
area.
and
these
days
of
tight
money
that
is
a
substantial
sum
because
in
seasonal
90-day
loan
that
comes
out
the
$52
million
a
year
available
to
meet
the
needs,
recurring
needs
of
other
industry.
but
as
a
regulatory
agency,
that
this
court
receiving
as
a
regulatory
agency
ask
yourself
all
these
questions,
would
you
charter
a
bank
under
your
obligation
to
consider
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
if
upon
the
day
that
bank
was
created,
$1
of
an
every
$8
that
it
had
let
out,
over
above
those
real
estate
mortgages
that
it
had,
was
classified
as
a
loss
or
a
potential
loss
item
by
the
bank
examiners?
would
--
as
i
mentioned
before,
you
charter
a
bank
which
was
going
to
pay
his
employees
such
low
salaries,
now
we'd
have
to
consider
the
danger
of
the
calcations
because
low
bank
salaries
are
admittedly
one
of
the
causes
of
embezzlement?
would
you
charter
a
bank
when
the
proposers
had
nobody
capable
of
commercial
lending
or
supervising
a
loan?
would
you
charter
a
bank
that
had
no
credit
files
or
whatsoever
and
had
no
plans
for
any?
would
you
charter
a
bank
that
had
$8
million
or
was
going
to
have
$8
million
in
loans
and
keep
all
of
the
ledgers
and
entities?
would
you
charter
a
bank
which
would
have
on
the
day
of
its
inception,
a
trust
department
which
was
permitting
the
deception
of
the
public,
by
allowing
principles
of
an
association
to
speculate
the
perpetual
care
funds
on
which
maintained
other
non-conforming
trust?
or
if
you
are
chartering
a
bank,
would
you
charter
one
that
plan
to
maintain
its
records
which
were
needed
currently?
in
cigar
boxes,
packing
boxes,
and
the
like,
the
pictures
of
these
are
in
the
record
of
page
1205
and
several
pages
thereafter.
that
is
what
we
would
have
if
we
chartered
this
bank
today
and
if
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
could
certainly
not
be
served
by
chartering
such
an
institution
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
these
reports
mr.
chief
justice
were
made
in
1960,
1961,
1962,
and
1963.
they
showed
a
constantly
or
continuously
deteriorating
position
of
the
bank.
they
classified
loans
doubled
between
1961
and
1962.
and
although,
it
improved
very
slightly
in
1963,
the
examiner
did
note
that
many
of
the
classified
loans
have
been
replaced
with
other
classified
loans.
and
the
trust
department
was
criticized
the
violations
that
i
referred
to,
was
criticized
for
a
period
of
at
least
those
four
years
and
for
years
before
that
according
to
the
reports
although
i
don't
honestly
know
how
long
the
situation
did
exist.
i
might
point
out
that
in
serving
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community,
third
national
bank
subsequent
to
the
merger,
has
replaced
all
the
speculative
assets
in
the
trust
department
with
solid
assets
more
prudent
adherence
to
prudence
manual.
third
national
bank
has
gotten
rid
of
all
of
the
classified
loans,
you
know,
by
putting
their
expertise
to
work
on
them,
getting
collateralized
and
repaid
or
by
charging
off
immediately
upon
the
assumption
of
this
bank
of
$121,000
as
lawsuits.
third
national
bank
also
has
introduced
a
continuous
trust
audit
because
the
national
bank
and
trust
company
despite
its
reputation
as
a
good
trust
company,
had
absolutely
no
audit
of
trust
assets
and
whatsoever.
it
did
not
have
a
continuous
audit
of
its
commercial
department
despite
the
fact
that
every
national
bank
in
that
region,
with
the
same
amount
of
deposits
is
subject
to
continuous
audit.
that's
uncontradicted
testimony
again
to
the
record.
so
we
submit
that
if
you
wouldn't
charter
a
bank
like
that
to
meet
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community,
it
is
not
reasonable
that
the
rule
of
reason
is
to
prevail
in
bank
merger
cases.
it's
not
reasonable
to
state
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
law
to
remove
all
of
these
problems
and
to
have
a
good
sound,
aggressive,
and
progressive
bank
take
over
the
human
resources
and
the
material
resources,
and
to
employ
them
in
the
central
side.
the
third
national
bank
--
the
national
bank
and
trust
company
was
the
only
mortgage
lending
bank
in
nashville.
they
had
about
40%
of
its
portfolio
in
long-term
mortgage.
upon
taking
it
over,
the
third
national
bank,
put
that
mortgage
paper,
sold
that
mortgage
paper,
and
that
money
is
available
for
commercial
lending.
and
if
the
record
is
replete
on
one
thing,
it's
the
need
and
the
central-south
for
commercial
lending.
it
is
a
capital
deficit
of
area,
experienced
in
one
of
the
most
rapid
industrial
growths
in
the
country.
it
sorely
needs
investment
capital
and
working
capital.
and
the
third
national
bank
has
utilized
the
national
bank
and
trust
company
resources,
and
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
primary
factors
in
assessing
convenience
and
needs
certainly
by
regulatory
agency.
the
convenience
and
needs
could
narrow
us
down
to
whether
a
bank
is
going
to
do
a
good
job
or
to
deposit
his
money
with
which
it
has
been
entrusted.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes,
i
do
that
right
now
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
we
believe
that
the
legislative
record
in
this
case
at
least
insofar
as
it
was
made
by
the
supporters
of
this
legislation,
rather
than
its
opponents.
and
the
opponents
of
this
legislation
are
clearly
led
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
mr.
patman.
the
supporters
of
this
legislation
and
the
court
incidentally
the
three-judge
court
in
the
us
v.
crocker-anglo
case,
another
bank
merger
case,
after
an
extensive
study
of
the
legislative
history,
arrived
at
this
conclusion
in
its
opinion
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
supporters
of
this
legislation
indicated
that
there
was
another
antitrust
standard.
now
the
question
is,
how
does
the
court
arrive
at
this?
there's
one
difference
between
the
language
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
language
of
the
bank
merger
act
and
that's
the
absence
of
the
phrase
“line
of
commerce”.
now
obviously
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
a
product
market,
but
the
legislative
history
has
explained
in
our
brief
at
more
length,
between
pages
40
and
52,
show
that
the
ashley-ottinger
proposal
intended
that
competition
the
banks
received
from
all
institutions
be
considered
in
assessing
the
competitive
effect
of
a
merger.
this
court,
incidentally
the
house
report
on
the
bill
which
finally
became
law,
also
used
the
phrase
“competition
among
financial
institutions”
and
senator
robertson
in
floor
debate,
and
in
extension
of
remarks,
indicated
that
the
meaning
of
this
was
that
competition
from
all
financial
institutions
was
to
be
considered.
now
we
can
get
the
statistics
and
they
are
contained
in
this
record
to
show
that
it
cuts
the
percentages
down
to
about
half
if
we
introduced
all
the
dollars
deposited
or
lent
by
other
commercial
institutions
or
financial
institutions
of
nashville.
but
it's
almost
impossible
to
get
a
--
in
an
accurate
statistical
measure
if
we
consider
the
competition
from
all
various
financial
institutions.
if
no
defense
was
entered,
and
i
think
the
houston
case
would
hold
this,
it
should
be
my
interpretation
of
it,
if
no
defense
were
entered,
and
obviously
the
standard
of
section
7
and
the
standard
set
down
by
this
court
in
philadelphia,
that
the
line
of
commerce
was
commercial
banking
would
be
a
valid
one,
but
once
the
affirmative
defense
of
the
bank
merger
act,
the
entire
defense
of
the
bank
merger
act
comes
into
play,
and
other
financial
institutions
might
be
considered.
i
believe
it's
a
congress
trying
to
say,
“let's
consider
not
merely
a
pure
statistical
concept
of
competition,
but
let's
consider
the
realities
of
competition
in
any
given
market.
this
bank,
under
that,
you
can
blend
really
as
mr.
henry
suggested,
rather
than
try
to
get
part
of
a
scale
over
here
and
part
of
a
scale
over
here,
and
put
so
much
weight
here
and
balance
it
off,
i
think
you
can
blend
the
two.
the
realities
of
competition
in
the
marketplace
where
it
occurs
and
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
public
which
to
a
certain
degree
have
to
be
under
related.
a
bank
cannot
be
a
competitor
if
it
has
no
competitive
ability
no
matter
what
the
statistics
might
be.
so
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
can
balance
both
sides
of
the
equation
without
the
necessity
of
making
a
formal
balance.
so
it
can
just
consider
the
overall
picture
and
ask
itself
a
question
is
competition
really
hurt
here?
i
submit
that
except
for
statistics
your
honor,
there
has
been
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
to
show
that
competition
was
adversely
affected
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
the
two
major
bank
presidents
who
testified
as
to
the
elimination
of
competition
or
the
aggressiveness
of
competition,
both
had
sizable
corresponding
balances
from
the
trust
company
sitting
in
their
banks.
the
largest
bank
in
town
had
$2.5
million
of
trust
company
funds
at
its
disposable
at
all
times.
and
it
was
made
clear
by
other
witnesses
that
what
they
are
talking
about
meeting
them
in
competition,
is
that
they
would
go
around
and
talk
to
these
accounts
in
case
their
relationship
between
the
largest
bank
in
town
and
the
trust
company
ever
broke
up,
the
largest
bank
would
still
be
friendly
with
the
account.
but
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
in
nashville,
a
correspondent,
large
correspondent
does
not
compete
with
the
smaller
bank.
they're
helpful.
both
bank
presidents
testified
that
they're
helpful.
they
send
accounts
to
the
national
bank
and
trust
company
just
to
give
it
a
hand.
so
this
was
not
a
commercial
area.
national
area
as
i
said,
is
highly
industrialized
and
growing.
the
acme
boot
company,
the
world's
largest
maker
of
boots
started
in
that
community
or
the
communities
around
it,
it
has
grown
over
the
years
and
its
needs
have
met
by
third
national
bank.
the
president
of
that
company
although
probably
aware
of
the
existence
of
national
bank
and
trust
company
did
not
know
that
it
was
a
commercial
bank.
it
was
just
not
considered
a
commercial
bank
in
that
community
in
any
sense
of
the
world.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
convenience
and
needs
feature
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
but
first,
i
would
like
to
note
that
a
new
element
has
been
introduced
into
that
act
by
the
argument
of
the
department
of
justice,
the
question
of
the
alternative
purchaser.
there
is
first
of
all,
a
recognition
in
the
bank
merger
act
by
its
very
terms
that
two
sound
banks
in
substantial
competition
with
each
other
can
be
merged
out
of
exists
--
merged
into
one,
if
the
convenience
and
needs
of
a
community
clearly
outweigh
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
that
merger.
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
clearly
demonstrates
that
congress
felt
that
a
floundering
bank
or
a
stagnant
bank
such
as
we
had
in
the
national
bank
and
trust
company
was
covered
by
the
act,
without
question.
certainly
the
failing
bank
was
not
the
intend
of
congress
because
section
6
of
the
act
provides
that
the
agency
may
merge
out
the
failing
bank
without
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general,
without
an
advisory
report,
and
as
far
as
prosecution
for
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
upon
the
consummation
of
such
merger
which
can
be
immediate.
so
that
the
convenience
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
it's
on
page
38
of
the
appellant's
brief.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
starting
with
the
last
sentence
on
page
37,
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
now
the
conclusion
of
that
sentence
in
regard
to
7
(a),
the
next
paragraph,
and
it
states
that
the
action
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws
arising
out
of
a
merger
transaction,
shall
be
commenced
prior
to
the
earliest
time
under
paragraph
6,
at
which
a
merger
transaction
approved
under
paragraph
5
might
be
consummated.
so
that
there
is
no
time
between
the
approval
and
the
time
it
might
be
consummated.
so
this
--
the
failing
bank,
the
statement
carried
in
section
6
and
section
7,
it's
not
applicable,
section
5
is
not
applicable
in
any
sense
of
the
word
for
the
failing
bank
so
two
sound
can
banks
can
merge.
now
the
banking
agencies
have
considered
convenience
and
needs
in
three
different
areas
in
the
chartering
of
new
banks
and
the
approval
of
branches
to
existing
banks,
and
then
the
mergers
or
consolidations
of
the
existing
banks.
the
convenience
and
needs
has
never
been
defined
by
statute
and
to
my
knowledge
never
by
a
case
settled
by
this
court.
so
we
have
to
look
to
those
statutes
that
a
bank
regulatory
agency
considers
preferably
in
this
case
in
the
charter
with
the
new
bank
because
they
are
similar
to
those
used
in
the
approval
of
the
merger.
first,
is
the
new
bank
needed
by
the
community.
will
it
be
a
sound
bank?
do
the
proposers
of
this
bank
have
a
good
management
team?
will
they
be
able
to
serve
the
community
in
the
primary
function
of
a
bank
particularly
a
commercial
bank
or
it
would
be
able
to
lend
money
in
a
way
that
it's
going
to
benefit
the
economy
of
the
community,
without
money
by
supporting
marketing
capital
to
industries,
create
jobs,
expand
plans,
and
in
otherwise
contribute
to
the
betterment
of
the
people
whom
that
bank
serves.
this
is
the
one
fact
and
now
another
factor
in
convenience
and
needs
is
competition.
is
there
enough
competition
in
a
town
or
in
area
among
banks,
or
among
other
financial
institution
if
that
maybe
the
case?
would
the
addition
of
a
new
competitive
entity
injure
the
existing
competition?
and
in
a
merger,
where
the
removal
of
a
competitive
entity
help
competition
which
can
be
done
and
the
record
in
this
case
is
uncontradicted.
the
competition
among
banks
and
financial
institutions
in
nashville
has
been
greater
since
this
merger
than
before
the
merger.
even
the
appellant's
own
witness,
an
economist,
testified
that
this
was
a
probable
consequence
of
this
particular
merger.
i
think
we
might
best
apply
the
convenience
and
needs
test
to
this
particular
merger
by
asking
ourselves
some
questions.
first,
the
sole
of
the
trust
company
was
exposed
during
the
course
of
this
trial
by
the
introduction
of
examiner
reports,
it's
our
confidential,
unfortunately,
the
bank
was
out
of
existence
at
the
time
the
trial
took
place
or
it
probably
would
have
destroyed
the
public
confidence
in
the
bank
anyway.
by
the
introduction
of
these
examiner's
reports,
the
internal
weaknesses
of
the
bank,
the
poor
condition
of
its
own
portfolio,
the
deficiencies
in
its
management,
the
default
and
its
service
to
the
community,
and
its
acquiescence,
indeed
of
violations
of
the
law
in
the
administration
of
trust,
things
that
were
formally
only
known
to
the
bank
law
officers
and
to
the
examining
agency,
which
is
not
a
contour
of
the
currency
of
the
ftic
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
public
and
this
is
known
in
national
tennessee,
because
it
received
great
covers
in
that
city.
so
i
consider
the
bank
in
that
condition
where
everyone
knowing
what
it
is,
if
the
status
quo
were
returned,
as
an
employee
now
who
worked
for
third
national
bank,
would
you
want
to
go
to
the
national
bank
and
trust
company,
at
a
salary
which
is
lowest
in
the
city
and
below
the
poverty
level
which
is
cut
if
government
recognizes
in
its
economic
opportunity
programs.
every
employee
of
national
bank
and
trust
receives
an
increase
in
salary
subsequent
to
the
merger
with
third
national
bank.
there
are
long-term
division
heads.
there's
no
promotional
opportunity,
no
assurance
of
a
pension.
there
is
no
funded
pension
plan
and
this
is
a
regulatory
problem
for
40%
of
our
nation's
banks
have
no
fund
of
pension
plans.
as
an
officer,
you
have
not
given
any
responsibilities
by
this
bank.
while
officer
kirby
primm,
who
was
acknowledge
by
both,
i
should
say
the
three
sides
in
this
particular
case,
who
was
acknowledge
as
being
the
outstanding
business
development
officer
had
its
salary
increase
only
45%
in
10
years.
and
upon
leaving
this
bank
to
go
to
the
largest
bank
in
town,
had
an
increase
immediately
60%,
showing
how
far
out
of
scale,
the
officer's
salary
of
this
bank
were.
as
mr.
henry
stated,
it
had
been
18
years
since
the
department
head
have
been
changed
and
no
college
graduates
were
hired.
there
was
just
no
opportunity
for
advancement
at
all,
and
the
officer
salaries
again
where
the
law
is
entailed.
moreover
they
did
not
have
the
tools
to
go
out
and
get
business.
their
new
business
development
officer
testified
that
they
did
because
of
their
lack
of
automation,
their
lack
of
a
computer,
things
of
that
sort,
lack
of
branches.
they
were
not
able
to
go
out
and
service
the
industries
in
the
national
area.
and
that
includes
a
lot
of
comings
around
national,
and
there
was
no
leadership
in
the
bank.
as
a
depositor,
knowing
the
condition
of
this
bank,
would
you
entrust
the
sum
of
money
of
your
own
over
and
above
the
amount
ensured
by
the
ftic
to
the
management
of
this
type
of
individual
who
had
this
bank?
as
a
businessman,
needing
the
financial
expertise
of
a
bank,
would
you
entrust
your
business
and
financial
requirements
to
a
bank
that
had
no
loan
officer
competent
to
handle
the
--
or
supervise
either
the
making
or
the
employment
of
funds
or
the
collection
of
funds?
they're
unable
to
service
a
$500,000
credit
from
an
admittedly
credit
worthy
mortgage
broker
in
nashville,
and
had
to
go
out
to
the
larger
bank
in
town
to
get
the
assistance
to
do
it.
this
bank
was
just
not
competing
in
the
commercial
field
at
all
and
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
it
was.
as
a
community
leader,
the
recreation
of
this
bank
would
result
in
the
removal,
assuming
that
law
policies
to
be
the
same
as
they
were
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
would
result
in
the
removal
of
$30
million
of
commercial
funds
available
to
the
industries
of
that
area.
and
these
days
of
tight
money
that
is
a
substantial
sum
because
in
seasonal
90-day
loan
that
comes
out
the
$52
million
a
year
available
to
meet
the
needs,
recurring
needs
of
other
industry.
but
as
a
regulatory
agency,
that
this
court
receiving
as
a
regulatory
agency
ask
yourself
all
these
questions,
would
you
charter
a
bank
under
your
obligation
to
consider
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
if
upon
the
day
that
bank
was
created,
$1
of
an
every
$8
that
it
had
let
out,
over
above
those
real
estate
mortgages
that
it
had,
was
classified
as
a
loss
or
a
potential
loss
item
by
the
bank
examiners?
would
--
as
i
mentioned
before,
you
charter
a
bank
which
was
going
to
pay
his
employees
such
low
salaries,
now
we'd
have
to
consider
the
danger
of
the
calcations
because
low
bank
salaries
are
admittedly
one
of
the
causes
of
embezzlement?
would
you
charter
a
bank
when
the
proposers
had
nobody
capable
of
commercial
lending
or
supervising
a
loan?
would
you
charter
a
bank
that
had
no
credit
files
or
whatsoever
and
had
no
plans
for
any?
would
you
charter
a
bank
that
had
$8
million
or
was
going
to
have
$8
million
in
loans
and
keep
all
of
the
ledgers
and
entities?
would
you
charter
a
bank
which
would
have
on
the
day
of
its
inception,
a
trust
department
which
was
permitting
the
deception
of
the
public,
by
allowing
principles
of
an
association
to
speculate
the
perpetual
care
funds
on
which
maintained
other
non-conforming
trust?
or
if
you
are
chartering
a
bank,
would
you
charter
one
that
plan
to
maintain
its
records
which
were
needed
currently?
in
cigar
boxes,
packing
boxes,
and
the
like,
the
pictures
of
these
are
in
the
record
of
page
1205
and
several
pages
thereafter.
that
is
what
we
would
have
if
we
chartered
this
bank
today
and
if
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
could
certainly
not
be
served
by
chartering
such
an
institution
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
these
reports
mr.
chief
justice
were
made
in
1960,
1961,
1962,
and
1963.
they
showed
a
constantly
or
continuously
deteriorating
position
of
the
bank.
they
classified
loans
doubled
between
1961
and
1962.
and
although,
it
improved
very
slightly
in
1963,
the
examiner
did
note
that
many
of
the
classified
loans
have
been
replaced
with
other
classified
loans.
and
the
trust
department
was
criticized
the
violations
that
i
referred
to,
was
criticized
for
a
period
of
at
least
those
four
years
and
for
years
before
that
according
to
the
reports
although
i
don't
honestly
know
how
long
the
situation
did
exist.
i
might
point
out
that
in
serving
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community,
third
national
bank
subsequent
to
the
merger,
has
replaced
all
the
speculative
assets
in
the
trust
department
with
solid
assets
more
prudent
adherence
to
prudence
manual.
third
national
bank
has
gotten
rid
of
all
of
the
classified
loans,
you
know,
by
putting
their
expertise
to
work
on
them,
getting
collateralized
and
repaid
or
by
charging
off
immediately
upon
the
assumption
of
this
bank
of
$121,000
as
lawsuits.
third
national
bank
also
has
introduced
a
continuous
trust
audit
because
the
national
bank
and
trust
company
despite
its
reputation
as
a
good
trust
company,
had
absolutely
no
audit
of
trust
assets
and
whatsoever.
it
did
not
have
a
continuous
audit
of
its
commercial
department
despite
the
fact
that
every
national
bank
in
that
region,
with
the
same
amount
of
deposits
is
subject
to
continuous
audit.
that's
uncontradicted
testimony
again
to
the
record.
so
we
submit
that
if
you
wouldn't
charter
a
bank
like
that
to
meet
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community,
it
is
not
reasonable
that
the
rule
of
reason
is
to
prevail
in
bank
merger
cases.
it's
not
reasonable
to
state
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
law
to
remove
all
of
these
problems
and
to
have
a
good
sound,
aggressive,
and
progressive
bank
take
over
the
human
resources
and
the
material
resources,
and
to
employ
them
in
the
central
side.
the
third
national
bank
--
the
national
bank
and
trust
company
was
the
only
mortgage
lending
bank
in
nashville.
they
had
about
40%
of
its
portfolio
in
long-term
mortgage.
upon
taking
it
over,
the
third
national
bank,
put
that
mortgage
paper,
sold
that
mortgage
paper,
and
that
money
is
available
for
commercial
lending.
and
if
the
record
is
replete
on
one
thing,
it's
the
need
and
the
central-south
for
commercial
lending.
it
is
a
capital
deficit
of
area,
experienced
in
one
of
the
most
rapid
industrial
growths
in
the
country.
it
sorely
needs
investment
capital
and
working
capital.
and
the
third
national
bank
has
utilized
the
national
bank
and
trust
company
resources,
and
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
primary
factors
in
assessing
convenience
and
needs
certainly
by
regulatory
agency.
the
convenience
and
needs
could
narrow
us
down
to
whether
a
bank
is
going
to
do
a
good
job
or
to
deposit
his
money
with
which
it
has
been
entrusted.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes,
i
do
that
right
now
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
we
believe
that
the
legislative
record
in
this
case
at
least
insofar
as
it
was
made
by
the
supporters
of
this
legislation,
rather
than
its
opponents.
and
the
opponents
of
this
legislation
are
clearly
led
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
mr.
patman.
the
supporters
of
this
legislation
and
the
court
incidentally
the
three-judge
court
in
the
us
v.
crocker-anglo
case,
another
bank
merger
case,
after
an
extensive
study
of
the
legislative
history,
arrived
at
this
conclusion
in
its
opinion
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
supporters
of
this
legislation
indicated
that
there
was
another
antitrust
standard.
now
the
question
is,
how
does
the
court
arrive
at
this?
there's
one
difference
between
the
language
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
language
of
the
bank
merger
act
and
that's
the
absence
of
the
phrase
“line
of
commerce”.
now
obviously
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
a
product
market,
but
the
legislative
history
has
explained
in
our
brief
at
more
length,
between
pages
40
and
52,
show
that
the
ashley-ottinger
proposal
intended
that
competition
the
banks
received
from
all
institutions
be
considered
in
assessing
the
competitive
effect
of
a
merger.
this
court,
incidentally
the
house
report
on
the
bill
which
finally
became
law,
also
used
the
phrase
“competition
among
financial
institutions”
and
senator
robertson
in
floor
debate,
and
in
extension
of
remarks,
indicated
that
the
meaning
of
this
was
that
competition
from
all
financial
institutions
was
to
be
considered.
now
we
can
get
the
statistics
and
they
are
contained
in
this
record
to
show
that
it
cuts
the
percentages
down
to
about
half
if
we
introduced
all
the
dollars
deposited
or
lent
by
other
commercial
institutions
or
financial
institutions
of
nashville.
but
it's
almost
impossible
to
get
a
--
in
an
accurate
statistical
measure
if
we
consider
the
competition
from
all
various
financial
institutions.
if
no
defense
was
entered,
and
i
think
the
houston
case
would
hold
this,
it
should
be
my
interpretation
of
it,
if
no
defense
were
entered,
and
obviously
the
standard
of
section
7
and
the
standard
set
down
by
this
court
in
philadelphia,
that
the
line
of
commerce
was
commercial
banking
would
be
a
valid
one,
but
once
the
affirmative
defense
of
the
bank
merger
act,
the
entire
defense
of
the
bank
merger
act
comes
into
play,
and
other
financial
institutions
might
be
considered.
i
believe
it's
a
congress
trying
to
say,
“let's
consider
not
merely
a
pure
statistical
concept
of
competition,
but
let's
consider
the
realities
of
competition
in
any
given
market.
this
bank,
under
that,
you
can
blend
really
as
mr.
henry
suggested,
rather
than
try
to
get
part
of
a
scale
over
here
and
part
of
a
scale
over
here,
and
put
so
much
weight
here
and
balance
it
off,
i
think
you
can
blend
the
two.
the
realities
of
competition
in
the
marketplace
where
it
occurs
and
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
public
which
to
a
certain
degree
have
to
be
under
related.
a
bank
cannot
be
a
competitor
if
it
has
no
competitive
ability
no
matter
what
the
statistics
might
be.
so
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
can
balance
both
sides
of
the
equation
without
the
necessity
of
making
a
formal
balance.
so
it
can
just
consider
the
overall
picture
and
ask
itself
a
question
is
competition
really
hurt
here?
i
submit
that
except
for
statistics
your
honor,
there
has
been
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
to
show
that
competition
was
adversely
affected
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
the
two
major
bank
presidents
who
testified
as
to
the
elimination
of
competition
or
the
aggressiveness
of
competition,
both
had
sizable
corresponding
balances
from
the
trust
company
sitting
in
their
banks.
the
largest
bank
in
town
had
$2.5
million
of
trust
company
funds
at
its
disposable
at
all
times.
and
it
was
made
clear
by
other
witnesses
that
what
they
are
talking
about
meeting
them
in
competition,
is
that
they
would
go
around
and
talk
to
these
accounts
in
case
their
relationship
between
the
largest
bank
in
town
and
the
trust
company
ever
broke
up,
the
largest
bank
would
still
be
friendly
with
the
account.
but
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
in
nashville,
a
correspondent,
large
correspondent
does
not
compete
with
the
smaller
bank.
they're
helpful.
both
bank
presidents
testified
that
they're
helpful.
they
send
accounts
to
the
national
bank
and
trust
company
just
to
give
it
a
hand.
so
this
was
not
a
commercial
area.
national
area
as
i
said,
is
highly
industrialized
and
growing.
the
acme
boot
company,
the
world's
largest
maker
of
boots
started
in
that
community
or
the
communities
around
it,
it
has
grown
over
the
years
and
its
needs
have
met
by
third
national
bank.
the
president
of
that
company
although
probably
aware
of
the
existence
of
national
bank
and
trust
company
did
not
know
that
it
was
a
commercial
bank.
it
was
just
not
considered
a
commercial
bank
in
that
community
in
any
sense
of
the
world.
