[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
has
addressed
himself
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
–
you
think
that
the
public
convenience
and
needs
cannot
outweigh
the
anticompetitive
effects
as
long
as
there
is
a
way
of
solving
the
problems
sort
of
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
this
is
really
a
refinement
of
the
public
convenience
and
needs
of
the
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
is
the
statutory
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
do
you
think
the
convenience
and
needs
--
do
you
think
part
of
the
needs
should
be
measured
by
the
anticompetitive
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
way
you
put
it
i
would
think
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
could
easily
outweigh
the
anticompetitive
effects
even
if,
even
if
there
were
some
ways
shorter
during
the
next
problems
and
if
that's
true,
then
why
you're
asking
for
another
statutory
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
it's
part
of
the
judgment
of
needs.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
so
you
got
to
do
one
way
or
the
other
i
would
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
but
the
statute
says
that
convenience
and
need
outweigh
the
anticompetitive
effect,
then
the
merger
should
be
approved.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
clearly
outweigh
and
that
i
wouldn't
think
that
the
debate
is
clearly
outweigh
even
if
the
bank
problems
could
be
solve
in
other
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
you
suggest
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
henry,
i
think
that
you're
talk
about
this
bank
and
how
about
a
shape
and
things
like
that
really
goes
to
this
county
beyond
a
competitive
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
somebody
had
come
along
here
and
offered
the
owners
of
this
bank
a
cash
price
equal
to
the
market
value
of
the
stock
that
they
–
i
guess
to
merge
they
got
a
stock
–-
justice
byron
r.
white
--
equal
to
that
market
value
the
stock
that
i'm
going
to
give
to
this
merger.
some
owners
come
along
with
this
--
says,
i'm
a
banker,
anybody
who
could
start
out
with
$50
million
worth
of
asset,
is
going
to
have
and
it
should
be
a
successful
banker.
plenty
of
money
has
been
loaned.
i
can
make
a
profit.
i
want
to
buy
it,
cash
price.
what
would
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
owners
of
the
5%
bank.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
any
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
--
merger?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
got
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
and
here's
a
fellow
who
wants
to
merge.
he's
the
owner
and
certainly
there
was
a
merger
took
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
say
at
that
point
another
person
came
and
come
along
and
say,
“i
want
to
buy
this
bank.
i
want
to
stay
in
the
bank
with
this
business.
i
can
fix
this
bank
up
and
i
got
the
management,
here
it
is.”
and
there
was
no
question
then
that
what
the
bank
would
be
preserved,
as
the
bank
and
the
institution.
it
wouldn't
go
broke.
it
wouldn't
go
out
of
business.
it
would
stay
as
a
competitive
bank.
what
would
you
say
then

in
this
case?
