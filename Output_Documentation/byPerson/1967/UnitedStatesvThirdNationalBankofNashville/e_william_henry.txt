mr.
e.
william
henry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
the
time
that
i'm
going
to
use
for
the
appellees
is
to
cover
what
i
think
are
the
two
most
important
factors
in
this
case.
first
a
very
brief
review
of
the
facts
because
what
the
government
is
essentially
saying
is
that
this
court
should
conduct
still
another
de
novo
review
of
those
facts
to
go
behind
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
secondly
in
perhaps
more
importantly
those
facts
were
at
the
heart
of
the
district
court's
opinion
that
trust
company
had
indeed
reached
a
point
of
eminent
deterioration
and
that
it
was
a
stagnant
and
declining
institution,
and
that
its
elimination
as
a
statistical
competitive
unit
under
these
circumstances
was
entirely
lost.
mr.
e.
william
henry
well,
i
would
take
one
more
and
that
will
be
the
what
we
think
is
what
i
think
is
the
government's
principle
contention
and
that
is,
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
in
effect
simply
codified
the
failing
company
doctrine
which
was
already
the
state
of
the
law
and
nothing
more.
my
colleague,
mr.
o'malley
will
discuss
some
of
the
legislative
history
on
the
line
of
commerce.
he
will
discuss
the
meaning
of
convenience
and
needs
and
some
i
think
of
some
of
the
also
some
of
the
factual
elements
of
the
case.
the
trust
company
was
in
1956,
changed
its
name
to
national
bank
and
trust
company
to
reflect
its
banking
activities
that
it
was
just
embarking
on
at
that
time.
through
the
efforts
of
three
men,
with
mr.
hill
hackworth,
and
kirby
primm
who
was
in
charge
of
their
new
business
at
that
time,
they
did
indeed
make
considerable
strides
and
show
considerable
profits
for
the
first
four
years
of
their
operation
from
1956
to
1960.
at
this
time
and
in
the
four
years
preceding
the
merger,
they
began
to
go
down
hill.
their
share
of
the
market
in
the
national
area,
declined
over
15%.
and
in
1964,
they
had
only
4.8%
of
the
market,
which
of
course
was
in
sharp
contrast
not
only
to
the
growth
of
the
community
but
to
the
performance
of
the
other
banks
in
the
area.
so
their
relative
position
in
the
market,
the
client
considerably.
the
ipc
deposits
mentioned
by
mr.
friedman,
which
are
generally
regarded
to
be
as
the
most
effective
statistical
index
of
a
bank's
performance,
the
client
absolutely
and
it
was
the
only
bank
in
the
county
to
show
an
actual
dollar
decrease
in
these
four
years.
it
was
the
only
bank
in
the
county
who
can
do
that.
in
1962,
some
two
years
prior
to
the
merger,
trust
company's
loan
portfolio
had
deteriorated
seriously.
it's
ratio
of
classified
loans
to
capital
structure
exceeded
20%.
20%
is
normally
the
benchmark
and
only
used
by
the
regulatory
authorities
to
indicate
that
corrective
action
is
required.
trust
company's
ratio
is
27%.
the
ratio
of
its
classified
loans
to
all
loans
was
five
times
the
tennessee
average
and
this
had
nearly
tripled
in
the
two
years
preceding
the
merger.
mr.
e.
william
henry
loans,
it's
about
which
is
some
doubt
and
generally
are
uncollectible
and
therefore
frozen,
and
not
able
to
be
reinvested
in
the
community
to
businesses
that
needed
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
the
bank
examiners.
it's
loan
loss
ratio
that
is
the
loans
on
which
they
actually
showed
a
loss
was
three
times,
it
was
6.9%
which
was
considerably
high,
i
beg
your
pardon
5.6%
which
was
considerably
high
was
three
times,
for
example,
third
national's,
the
acquiring
bank
here
which
was
an
active,
aggressive,
successful
bank.
it
had
–
trust
company
had
more
classified
loans
by
dollar
volume
than
did
third
national,
although
third
national's
total
loans
was
more
than
eight
times
trust
company's.
the
classified
loans
at
trust
company
were
145%
of
its
reserve
for
bad
debts
in
spite
of
the
fact
of
trust
the
company's
history
over
the
years
of
having
a
rather
bad
debt
history
and
in
therefore
it
had
a
rather
high
reserve
for
bad
debts.
now
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed
and
the
district
court
found
that
commercial
lending
is
the
heart
of
the
commercial
banking
business.
it
also
shows
the
trust
company
did
very
little
of
this.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
had
between
$40
to
$50
million
in
assets,
it
had
roughly
only
$12
million
actively
engaged
in
commercial
lending
in
the
community.
the
trust
company
kept
no
credit
files.
it
had
no
credit
specialists.
the
testimony
indicated
that
if
a
man
came
in
for
a
loan,
and
the
particular
officer
that
had
handled
that
loan
was
out
to
lunch
or
on
vacation,
the
man
cannot
be
served
because
the
information
with
respect
to
his
loan
was
carried
around
in
the
officer's
head.
the
trust
company
had
the
lowest
loan
to
asset
ratio
in
the
county,
the
lowest
asset
ratio
loan
to
asset
ratio
in
the
county,
it
was
lower
even
than
the
smaller
banks
to
which
mr.
friedman
referred
to
that
were
only
1/4
or
1/5
trust
company's
size.
i
think
the
clearest
stack
in
the
record
was
trust
company's
serious
problems
with
respect
to
its
management.
the
evidence
indicated
that
four
of
the
directors
were
over
75,
nine
were
over
65.
of
its
department
head,
two-thirds
were
65
or
older
and
i
hasten
to
add
these
were
not
the
mature
men
who
had
risen
to
the
top
of
a
profession
but
these
were
men
who
had
in
fact
been
passed
over
and
were
not
contributing.
in
the
department
heads,
there
had
not
been
a
single
change
in
the
bank
for
over
18
years.
new
departments
were
created
when
it
became
engaged
in
banking,
but
those
department
heads
had
never
been
changed
and
the
other
had
not
been
changed
for
18
years.
the
average
salary
level
of
all
employees
in
the
bank
was
the
lowest
of
the
banks
in
the
county.
the
average
salary
of
all
employees
was
lower
even
than
the
smaller
banks
in
the
county.
i
assume
these
are
the
salaries
that
the
government's
expert
referred
to
as
what
he
considered
to
be
adequate.
80%
of
the
officers
in
trust
company's
banking
department
were
not
college
graduates.
our
side
of
the
trust
department,
there
was
only
one
man,
one
officer
under
40,
who
was
a
college
graduate.
and
in
the
entire
banking
department
of
the
trust
company,
they
had
not
hired
a
college
graduate
in
the
five
years
preceding
the
merger.
they
had
only
one
branch
in
the
county
that
had
over
50
banking
officers.
again,
the
smaller
banks
in
the
county
had
passed
it
by
in
this
respect.
there
was
one
bank,
the
record
showed,
that
was
much
smaller
than
trust
company
and
had
more
branch
offices.
trust
company
had
no
corresponding
banking
system.
and
thus
was
unable
to
provide
any
correspondent
banking
services
for
the
rural
banks
in
the
area,
nor
provide
the
contacts
to
its
own
customers
that
a
correspondent
banking
system
involves.
its
bookkeeping
and
its
accounting
procedures
were
obsolete
and
inadequate.
its
mortgage
ledgers
representing
over
40%
of
trust
company's
loans
were
kept
with
pen
and
ink.
it
had
no
computer.
it
used
no
computer
service
company
and
thus
it
was
unable
to
handle
any
payroll
account
that
involved
ibm
or
other
computer
cards.
it
did
not
have
a
continuous
audit
program.
it
lacked
any
continuous
system
of
auditing
the
various
receipts
and
disbursements
and
not
unexpectedly
this
led
to
a
discovery
after
the
merger
of
a
major
defalcation,
over
$50,000
that
had
taken
place
prior
to
the
merger.
the
controls
over
its
trust
department
were
breaking
down.
the
ftic
examiner
found
that
the
improvements
that
they
had
previously
recommended
had
not
been
carried
out.
little
control
had
been
exercised
over
the
trust
officers
and
that
certain
of
the
members
of
the
trust
department
had
acquiesced
in
violations
of
law
in
the
use
of
trust
funds.
and
the
ftic's
rating
of
the
bank
for
the
two
years
preceding
the
merger,
had
been
reduced
below
satisfactory
to
fair.
the
trust
department,
of
which
it
was
so
found,
had
never
had
a
rating
above
fair.
now
these
problems
that
i
have
just
enumerated
occurred
prior
to
mr.
weaver's
purchase.
what
happened
after
mr.
weaver's
purchase?
well
mr.
hackworth
on
whom
mr.
weaver
was
counting
to
run
the
bank,
indicated
an
expression
–
to
a
desire
to
retire
because
of
ill
health
and
that
ill
health
subsequently
caused
his
death.
mr.
primm,
who
had
been
in-charge
of
the
new
business,
was
taken
away
by
the
largest
bank
in
the
county
first
american
and
took
a
considerable
amount
of
business
with
him.
the
control
of
the
currency
noted,
in
which
–
and
his
findings
are
part
of
the
record
in
approving
the
merger,
that
within
60
days
after
the
sale,
that
is
between
the
time
the
bank
--
the
trust
company
was
sold
to
mr.
weaver's
group
and
the
time
in
which
they
turned
around
and
sold
it,
the
assets
of
trust
company
had
gone
down
from
$45.4
million
to
$39.6
million
or
a
decrease
in
that
short
period
of
almost
13%.
and
finally,
though
trust
company
was
showing
a
profit
as
it's
been
pointed
out,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
that
even
that
profit
picture
was
distorted
and
it
was
unhealthy
and
the
testimony
showed
that
these
profits
had
been
squeezed
out
of
badly
needed
revenues
for
operating
expenses.
and
there
was
a
list
of
expenses
that
was
not
only
needed
but
which
the
acquiring
bank,
third
national
put
into
effect,
actually
extended
to
indicate
that
almost
the
entire
pre-tax
profits
were
necessary
to
put
trust
company
on
its
feet
as
annually
recurring
expenses,
in
addition
to
whatever
capital
expenditure
would
be
necessary.
the
largest
capital
expenditure
for
example,
was
the
one
that
was
actually
put
into
effect
and
to
create
the
funded
pension
plan
that
was
almost
half
a
million
dollars,
it
was
$400,000
plus.
now
i
would
like
to
get
to
what
we
consider
is
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
and
that
is,
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
new
law
had
its
primary
emphasis
placed
upon
creating
one
uniform
standards
for
use
by
courts
and
banking
authority
agencies
alike
in
judging
bank
mergers
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
congress
was
primarily
emphasizing
the
needs
for
courts
to
examine
the
so-called
banking
factors,
nevertheless
insofar
as
its
substantive
provision
are
concerned,
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
simply
did
no
more
than
codify
the
already
existing
failing
company
doctrine
that
was
in
antitrust
law
with
perhaps
slightly
expended
contours.
but
again,
their
position
indicates
that
in
spite
of
the
enormous
study
and
effort
that
went
into
this
new
law,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it's
considered
by
some
to
be
a
major
piece
of
legislation
for
the
89th
congress,
it
did
no
more
than
it
was
simply
codify
the
failing
company
doctrine
on
the
point.
mr.
e.
william
henry
well
i
agree,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
position
that
they
take
however
is
more
clearly
pointed
out
in
the
briefs
and
i
think
perhaps
they
stayed
away
from
it
in
oral
argument.
but
i
think
they
–
for
example,
in
attorney
general's
katzenbach's
letter
of
january
1966,
objecting
to
the
provisions
of
the
ashley-ottinger
proposal
which
was
in
effect,
and
active
into
the
bank
merger
law.
the
attorney
general
took
the
position
that
convenience
and
needs
should
be
considered
only
in
the
context
of
the
effect
on
competition,
and
the
likelihood
of
insolvency.
these
were
the
two
factors
that
the
attorney
general
said
should
be
considered
and
that
convenience
and
needs
should
be
considered
only
in
that
context.
now
in
the
reply
of
brief
of
the
government
at
page
16,
this
is
their
essential
position
at
the
bottom
of
page
16,
and
they
say
that
there
is
no
indication
that
the
bank,
trust
company,
was
inherently
unsound
that
it
was
facing
imminent
or
insoluble
financial
difficulties
or
dangers,
or
that
its
solvency
was
in
any
way
threatened.
in
short,
national
bank
was
not
a
floundering
bank.
that's
the
essence
of
their
position
it
seems
to
me
to
equate
a
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
well
i
don't
think
that
changed
their
basic
problem.
even
if
it
does,
i
think,
mr.
friedman's
colloquy
with
you
indicates
that
if
a
bank
does
have
alternative
methods
of
solving
its
very
serious
problems,
one
cannot
–
it's
not
even
necessary
to
inquire
into
the
service
to
convenience
and
needs.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
their
position
is
based
on
not
only
on
equating
the
floundering
or
stagnant
bank
with
the
failing
bank,
but
in
equating
the
banking
industry
with
every
other
industry.
and
considering
that
the
problems
associated
with
the
elimination
of
the
competitive
unit
in
the
banking
field
is
similar
to
the
elimination
of
a
company
in
any
other
field.
and
i
think
this
simply
misunderstands
the
responsibility
of
a
bank
not
only
to
serve
the
community,
but
to
get
its
assets
employed
in
a
fashion
that
may
not
produce
the
greatest
profits.
i
think
they
misunderstand
that
even
if
the
bank
has
been
demonstrated
to
meet
the
convenience
and
needs
test
then
somehow,
the
fact
that
mr.
weaver
showed
the
profit
on
it,
or
the
fact
that
he
listened
to
the
truth
as
explained
to
him
by
mr.
fleming,
that
somehow
his
profits
outweigh
the
public
interest
in
the
elimination
of
this
stagnant
institution.
mr.
e.
william
henry
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
think
it
reflects
on
that
certainly,
but
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
yes.
mr.
e.
william
henry
if
the
record
had
shown
that
this
had
been
offered
to
mr.
weaver's
group?
mr.
e.
william
henry
originally.
mr.
e.
william
henry
well
i
don't
get
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
e.
william
henry
that's
what
happened
in
effect,
is
it
not
that
the
weaver
group
came
along
which
was
not
in
the
banking
business
and
bought
the
bank
from
mr.
hill.
there
was
no
–
at
$350
of
share.
you
see
there
was
no
exchange
of
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
no,
that
was
the
first
purchase.
mr.
weaver
came
along
and
purchased
the
bank
from
mr.
hill
in
effect,
the
man
who
owned
the
grocery
channel
and
because
mr.
hill
needed
money
for
his
grocery,
and
he
paid
$350
of
share
cash
for
it.
mr.
e.
william
henry
then
he
subsequently
sold
out
to
the
third
national
bank.
mr.
e.
william
henry
after
the
original
process,
correct.
mr.
e.
william
henry
well
the
first
thing
i
would
point
out
of
course,
that
it
is
not
the
case
here
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
other
offer,
other
than
from
a
competitive
bank
in
the
county.
the
only
offers
that
mr.
weaver
received
were
from
two
competitive
banks.
now.
mr.
e.
william
henry
he
testified
that
he
although
the
problems
of
the
bank
had
been
indicated
to
him
originally,
he
did
not
understand
their
depth
and
their
scope
and
the
expense
of
a
corrective
measure.
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
whether
he
actively
sought
offers
or
whether
the
commerce
union
bank
and
the
third
national
first
approached
him.
i
think
the
later,
that
he
was
approached
originally
by
others
interested
in
it,
two
competitive
banks
in
the
county
approached
him.
mr.
e.
william
henry
for
merger.
mr.
e.
william
henry
that's
right.
that's
right,
they
wanted
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
he
was
approached
and
the
competitive
banks
approached
him,
i
think
as
early
as
one
month
after
his
acquisition.
the
merger
occurred
two
months
after
his
acquisition.
so
getting
back
to
your
question,
the
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
even
if
it
what
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
that's
certainly
a
large
part
of
our
contention,
yes.
because
we
think
that
the
question
of
the
stagnant
or
declining
institution
as
conceived
by
congress
was
aimed
primarily
at
increasing
this
--
the
banking
service
to
the
community,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
eliminated
as
a
competitive
unit
and
that
therefore
might
have
had
the
by
statistical
analysis
and
the
competitive
effects.
mr.
e.
william
henry
i
think
there
is
other
clear
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
the
proposition
that
it
met
the
needs
service,
that
it
brought
to
community
convenience
and
needs
clearly
outweighed
any
competitive
effects.
mr.
o'malley
is
going
to
discuss
what
those
banking
factors
are.
i
would
like
to
add
though
in
response
to
your
question
this
thought.
one
has
to
look
at
the
banking
business
as
it
operates
and
as
it
serves
the
public.
again,
in
looking
around
for
ultimate
purchasers,
how
far
does
the
owner
of
the
bank
have
to
go?
does
he
have
to
advertise
in
the
paper?
does
he
in
effect,
have
to
put
it
on
the
auction
block
and
sell
it
to
the
highest
bidder
other
than
a
competitive
bank?
to
what
extent
is
confidentiality
required
in
discussing
the
sale
of
the
bank
particularly
if
a
bank
has
problems?
how
far
and
how
long
should
mr.
weaver
have
looked
around?
the
record
shows
that
he
had
talked
to
some
13
prominent
people
both
inside
and
outside
of
national
to
see
if
he
could
--
to
see
if
they
had
any
suggestions
as
to
the
solution
to
this
bank's
problems.
he
found
none.
mr.
e.
william
henry
no
sir,
he
was
asking
them
what
in
effect
how
he
could
dissolve
the
problems
of
this
bank?
were
they
insoluble?
how
long
would
it
take
to
solve
them?
what
was
going
to
happen
to
the
bank
while
he
took
his
time
in
looking
around
for
new
management?
there
was
a
meeting
personnel
recruiter
who
testified
in
the
case
that
if
mr.
weaver
had
come
to
him
and
asked
him
to
find
a
management
team
for
him,
he
would
not
have
undertaken
the
job
because
he
did
not
feel
that
it
could
be
accomplished,
or
that
if
it
could
be
accomplished,
it
would
have
taken
years
and
the
doing.
so
what
we
are
saying
essentially
is
that
the
weaver
group
nor
indeed
any
purchaser
is
not
required
to
--
or
certainly
it
is
a
matter
of
judgment
as
to
how
long
he
is
required
to
conduct
this
inquiry.
how
far
he
is
to
go
in
revealing
the
problems
of
the
bank,
and
the
degree
to
which
he
must
look
around
for
other
purchasers.
mr.
e.
william
henry
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
william
henry
no,
i
did
not
say
declining
earnings.
i
say
the
declining
relative
position
in
the
market.
mr.
e.
william
henry
it
had
never
--
yes.
it
had
shown
a
continuing
increase
in
profits.
the
evidence
indicated
however
had
it
made
the
necessary
expenditures
to
overcome
the
problems
that
i
outlined.
for
example
it
cost
$51,000
annually
recurring
in
addition
to
an
$80,000
initial
investment
to
establish
one
branch.
they
had
only
one,
if
they
had
built
three
branches
or
four
branches,
they
would
have
shown
no
profit
or
whatsoever,
nor
have
they
had
any
money
leftover
for
capital
expenditures,
nor
if
they
need
to
pay
capital
dividends.
now
the
government
made
--
the
government
after
the
time
of
the
trial
in
its
brief
indicated
that
the
court
was
required
to
consider
the
effect
on
the
competition
of
--
and
on
the
public
interest
of
an
acquisition
by
competitive
bank
in
davidson
county.
they
indicated
that
the
law
requires
that
alternate
purchasers
be
considered
and
that
this
record
showed
that
there
was
an
alternate
purchaser
namely
the
commerce
union
bank,
that
was
a
smaller
bank,
and
that
therefore,
the
district
court
erred
because
it
did
not
consider
this
as
an
alternative
less
anticompetitive
solution
to
the
merger.
now
i
think
again,
this
indicates
the
deficiencies
of
the
rationale
of
the
government.
they
found
that
the
state,
that
this
merger
itself
would
have
been
anticompetitive,
would
have
combine
26%
of
the
banking
assets
in
the
community,
would
have
combined
35%
of
the
banking
offices
in
the
community,
and
would
have
resulted
in
exactly
the
same
degree
of
concentration
in
the
market,
in
the
top
three
banks
that
resulted
from
this
merger.
and
yet
they
say,
that's
a
less
anticompetitive
solution
and
vitiates
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
that
this
merger
was
lawful.
to
windup
my
part,
i
would
like
to
comment
just
briefly
on
the
trial
judge's
opinion
in
that
respect.
the
government
for
much
of
its
brief,
indicates
that
the
trial
judge's
reference
to
the
columbia
steel
case
in
effect
fatally
undermined
his
judgment
here.
i
think
he
had
two
problems
with
that.
first
of
all,
he
simply
indicated
that
he
felt
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
was
analogous
to
the
rule
of
reason.
that
in
weighing,
convenience
and
needs
against
anticompetitive
effects,
this
required
a
balancing
of
other
than
the
usual
section
7
considerations
although
he
realized
that
section
7
considerations
were
also
involved.
secondly,
he
considered
and
weighed
every
factual
matter
that
this
court
has
thought
under
its
section
7
considerations
pertained
to
mergers.
and
he
stated
in
his
opinion,
that
under
those,
what
he
called
pre-1966
standards,
the
government
had
established
an
arguable
case.
we
think
this
indicates
that
his
reference
was
left
to
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
not
simply
that
the
methods
by
which
anticompetitive
effects
would
be
considered
under
section
7
had
been
changed
and
as
indicated,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
case
was
decided
prior
to
this
court's
decision
of
houston.
mr.
e.
william
henry
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
one
or
two
points
before
i
close.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
appellee
banks,
the
floundering
bank
question
in
its
elimination
as
a
competitive
unit,
can
have
considerations
that
pertain
both
to
the
anticompetitive
effects
question
and
the
convenience
and
needs
question.
but
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
while
the
problems
with
respect
to
the
anticompetitive
effects
are
rather
apparent
when
we
are
dealing
with
this
stagnant
institution
because
in
many
respects
it
will
not
be
competing
effectively,
the
court
should
not
overlook
the
very
important
thrust
of
the
legislative
debated
of
the
law
itself.
it
seemed
to
emphasize
in
addition
to
the
competitive
questions
that
surround
the
elimination
or
the
operation
of
a
stagnant
institution.
the
manner,
the
fact
that
such
an
institution
also
very
often
fails
to
provide
certain
banking
services
to
the
community
even
though
it
maybe
rendering
some
competition
which
would
be
eliminated
by
the
merger.
so
one
has
to
look
at
both
sides
of
that
question,
both
sides
of
what
the
government
refers
to
as
the
equation
when
we're
talking
about
a
stagnant
institution.
also,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
do
feel
that
this
record
indicates
quite
clearly
that
there
are
--
that
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
was
met
by
this
merger
in
increasing
and
bringing
better
service
to
the
community
totally
apart
from
the
anticompetitive
considerations
involved.
now
the
reason
i
said
that
i
thought
that
the
government's
equation
or
analysis
of
this
law,
in
effect
was
limited
pretty
much
to
the
failing
company
doctrine
is
because,
as
emphasized
rather
heavily
in
their
original
brief,
they
seem
to
say
that
community
needs
and
services
are
some
new
and
important
kind
of
service
not
being
rendered
by
any
bank
in
the
community.
and
i
don't
know
what
they
are
talking
about
on
air
pollution,
or
traffic
safety,
or
what,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
consider
banking
services
when
you
are
considering
convenience
and
needs.
but
if
you
read
out
of
it
almost
as
they
do,
the
convenience
and
needs
question,
then
you
get
over
to
the
anticompetitive
side,
and
then
you
limit
yourself
to
that.
and
then
they
say,
“we're
back
to
the
failing
company
doctrine
in
the
look
for
alternative
purchases,
etcetera.”
so
i
think
in
this
case,
we
had
the
elimination
of
a
bank
as
a
competitive
unit.
that
not
only
was
failing
to
render
the
kind
of
services
that
it
should
and
therefore
was
failing
to
compete
as
effectively
as
it
should,
but
also
from
a
convenience
and
needs
point
of
view,
was
failing
to
render
to
the
public
apart
from
competitive
considerations,
the
kind
of
service
that
the
public
in
nashville
was
entitled
to
receive
from
each
banking
unit
and
the
customers
of
that
banking
unit
some
10,000
strong
were
not
receiving
those
services.
mr.
e.
william
henry
well,
i
think
it
is
a
--
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe
that
what
the
government
urges
should
be
done,
can
be
done.
they
are
urging
some
sort
of
a
conceptual
pigeonholing
of
the
various
factors.
mr.
e.
william
henry
and
i
think
what
the
court
--
what
this
court
should
look
at
is
--
what
it
looked
at
in
the
seaboard
air
line
railroad
company
versus
united
states
court
when
they
were
under
evaluation,
the
icc's
approval
of
a
merger.
and
there
they
found
that
the
failure
of
the
icc
to
find
the
section
7
violation
was
not
necessary
as
long
as
all
the
factual
matters
involved
in
the
anticompetitive
effects
question
were
examined,
and
the
impact
on
competition
was
examined.
i
think
that
is
the
question
that
this
court
should
look
at
and
not
simply
a
reference
to
a
case
that
stands
for
the
rule
of
reason.
so
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
to
--
that
this
court
should
examine
whether
the
district
court
looked
at
all
of
those
factors.
if
it
did,
its
opinion
should
be
affirmed.
if
it
found
that
it
didn't,
that
it
failed
to
look
at
all
those
factors,
i
assume
that
he
should
be
required
to
reexamine
those
factors
under
the
appropriate
standard.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
william
henry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
the
time
that
i'm
going
to
use
for
the
appellees
is
to
cover
what
i
think
are
the
two
most
important
factors
in
this
case.
first
a
very
brief
review
of
the
facts
because
what
the
government
is
essentially
saying
is
that
this
court
should
conduct
still
another
de
novo
review
of
those
facts
to
go
behind
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
secondly
in
perhaps
more
importantly
those
facts
were
at
the
heart
of
the
district
court's
opinion
that
trust
company
had
indeed
reached
a
point
of
eminent
deterioration
and
that
it
was
a
stagnant
and
declining
institution,
and
that
its
elimination
as
a
statistical
competitive
unit
under
these
circumstances
was
entirely
lost.
mr.
e.
william
henry
well,
i
would
take
one
more
and
that
will
be
the
what
we
think
is
what
i
think
is
the
government's
principle
contention
and
that
is,
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
in
effect
simply
codified
the
failing
company
doctrine
which
was
already
the
state
of
the
law
and
nothing
more.
my
colleague,
mr.
o'malley
will
discuss
some
of
the
legislative
history
on
the
line
of
commerce.
he
will
discuss
the
meaning
of
convenience
and
needs
and
some
i
think
of
some
of
the
also
some
of
the
factual
elements
of
the
case.
the
trust
company
was
in
1956,
changed
its
name
to
national
bank
and
trust
company
to
reflect
its
banking
activities
that
it
was
just
embarking
on
at
that
time.
through
the
efforts
of
three
men,
with
mr.
hill
hackworth,
and
kirby
primm
who
was
in
charge
of
their
new
business
at
that
time,
they
did
indeed
make
considerable
strides
and
show
considerable
profits
for
the
first
four
years
of
their
operation
from
1956
to
1960.
at
this
time
and
in
the
four
years
preceding
the
merger,
they
began
to
go
down
hill.
their
share
of
the
market
in
the
national
area,
declined
over
15%.
and
in
1964,
they
had
only
4.8%
of
the
market,
which
of
course
was
in
sharp
contrast
not
only
to
the
growth
of
the
community
but
to
the
performance
of
the
other
banks
in
the
area.
so
their
relative
position
in
the
market,
the
client
considerably.
the
ipc
deposits
mentioned
by
mr.
friedman,
which
are
generally
regarded
to
be
as
the
most
effective
statistical
index
of
a
bank's
performance,
the
client
absolutely
and
it
was
the
only
bank
in
the
county
to
show
an
actual
dollar
decrease
in
these
four
years.
it
was
the
only
bank
in
the
county
who
can
do
that.
in
1962,
some
two
years
prior
to
the
merger,
trust
company's
loan
portfolio
had
deteriorated
seriously.
it's
ratio
of
classified
loans
to
capital
structure
exceeded
20%.
20%
is
normally
the
benchmark
and
only
used
by
the
regulatory
authorities
to
indicate
that
corrective
action
is
required.
trust
company's
ratio
is
27%.
the
ratio
of
its
classified
loans
to
all
loans
was
five
times
the
tennessee
average
and
this
had
nearly
tripled
in
the
two
years
preceding
the
merger.
mr.
e.
william
henry
loans,
it's
about
which
is
some
doubt
and
generally
are
uncollectible
and
therefore
frozen,
and
not
able
to
be
reinvested
in
the
community
to
businesses
that
needed
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
the
bank
examiners.
it's
loan
loss
ratio
that
is
the
loans
on
which
they
actually
showed
a
loss
was
three
times,
it
was
6.9%
which
was
considerably
high,
i
beg
your
pardon
5.6%
which
was
considerably
high
was
three
times,
for
example,
third
national's,
the
acquiring
bank
here
which
was
an
active,
aggressive,
successful
bank.
it
had
–
trust
company
had
more
classified
loans
by
dollar
volume
than
did
third
national,
although
third
national's
total
loans
was
more
than
eight
times
trust
company's.
the
classified
loans
at
trust
company
were
145%
of
its
reserve
for
bad
debts
in
spite
of
the
fact
of
trust
the
company's
history
over
the
years
of
having
a
rather
bad
debt
history
and
in
therefore
it
had
a
rather
high
reserve
for
bad
debts.
now
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed
and
the
district
court
found
that
commercial
lending
is
the
heart
of
the
commercial
banking
business.
it
also
shows
the
trust
company
did
very
little
of
this.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
had
between
$40
to
$50
million
in
assets,
it
had
roughly
only
$12
million
actively
engaged
in
commercial
lending
in
the
community.
the
trust
company
kept
no
credit
files.
it
had
no
credit
specialists.
the
testimony
indicated
that
if
a
man
came
in
for
a
loan,
and
the
particular
officer
that
had
handled
that
loan
was
out
to
lunch
or
on
vacation,
the
man
cannot
be
served
because
the
information
with
respect
to
his
loan
was
carried
around
in
the
officer's
head.
the
trust
company
had
the
lowest
loan
to
asset
ratio
in
the
county,
the
lowest
asset
ratio
loan
to
asset
ratio
in
the
county,
it
was
lower
even
than
the
smaller
banks
to
which
mr.
friedman
referred
to
that
were
only
1/4
or
1/5
trust
company's
size.
i
think
the
clearest
stack
in
the
record
was
trust
company's
serious
problems
with
respect
to
its
management.
the
evidence
indicated
that
four
of
the
directors
were
over
75,
nine
were
over
65.
of
its
department
head,
two-thirds
were
65
or
older
and
i
hasten
to
add
these
were
not
the
mature
men
who
had
risen
to
the
top
of
a
profession
but
these
were
men
who
had
in
fact
been
passed
over
and
were
not
contributing.
in
the
department
heads,
there
had
not
been
a
single
change
in
the
bank
for
over
18
years.
new
departments
were
created
when
it
became
engaged
in
banking,
but
those
department
heads
had
never
been
changed
and
the
other
had
not
been
changed
for
18
years.
the
average
salary
level
of
all
employees
in
the
bank
was
the
lowest
of
the
banks
in
the
county.
the
average
salary
of
all
employees
was
lower
even
than
the
smaller
banks
in
the
county.
i
assume
these
are
the
salaries
that
the
government's
expert
referred
to
as
what
he
considered
to
be
adequate.
80%
of
the
officers
in
trust
company's
banking
department
were
not
college
graduates.
our
side
of
the
trust
department,
there
was
only
one
man,
one
officer
under
40,
who
was
a
college
graduate.
and
in
the
entire
banking
department
of
the
trust
company,
they
had
not
hired
a
college
graduate
in
the
five
years
preceding
the
merger.
they
had
only
one
branch
in
the
county
that
had
over
50
banking
officers.
again,
the
smaller
banks
in
the
county
had
passed
it
by
in
this
respect.
there
was
one
bank,
the
record
showed,
that
was
much
smaller
than
trust
company
and
had
more
branch
offices.
trust
company
had
no
corresponding
banking
system.
and
thus
was
unable
to
provide
any
correspondent
banking
services
for
the
rural
banks
in
the
area,
nor
provide
the
contacts
to
its
own
customers
that
a
correspondent
banking
system
involves.
its
bookkeeping
and
its
accounting
procedures
were
obsolete
and
inadequate.
its
mortgage
ledgers
representing
over
40%
of
trust
company's
loans
were
kept
with
pen
and
ink.
it
had
no
computer.
it
used
no
computer
service
company
and
thus
it
was
unable
to
handle
any
payroll
account
that
involved
ibm
or
other
computer
cards.
it
did
not
have
a
continuous
audit
program.
it
lacked
any
continuous
system
of
auditing
the
various
receipts
and
disbursements
and
not
unexpectedly
this
led
to
a
discovery
after
the
merger
of
a
major
defalcation,
over
$50,000
that
had
taken
place
prior
to
the
merger.
the
controls
over
its
trust
department
were
breaking
down.
the
ftic
examiner
found
that
the
improvements
that
they
had
previously
recommended
had
not
been
carried
out.
little
control
had
been
exercised
over
the
trust
officers
and
that
certain
of
the
members
of
the
trust
department
had
acquiesced
in
violations
of
law
in
the
use
of
trust
funds.
and
the
ftic's
rating
of
the
bank
for
the
two
years
preceding
the
merger,
had
been
reduced
below
satisfactory
to
fair.
the
trust
department,
of
which
it
was
so
found,
had
never
had
a
rating
above
fair.
now
these
problems
that
i
have
just
enumerated
occurred
prior
to
mr.
weaver's
purchase.
what
happened
after
mr.
weaver's
purchase?
well
mr.
hackworth
on
whom
mr.
weaver
was
counting
to
run
the
bank,
indicated
an
expression
–
to
a
desire
to
retire
because
of
ill
health
and
that
ill
health
subsequently
caused
his
death.
mr.
primm,
who
had
been
in-charge
of
the
new
business,
was
taken
away
by
the
largest
bank
in
the
county
first
american
and
took
a
considerable
amount
of
business
with
him.
the
control
of
the
currency
noted,
in
which
–
and
his
findings
are
part
of
the
record
in
approving
the
merger,
that
within
60
days
after
the
sale,
that
is
between
the
time
the
bank
--
the
trust
company
was
sold
to
mr.
weaver's
group
and
the
time
in
which
they
turned
around
and
sold
it,
the
assets
of
trust
company
had
gone
down
from
$45.4
million
to
$39.6
million
or
a
decrease
in
that
short
period
of
almost
13%.
and
finally,
though
trust
company
was
showing
a
profit
as
it's
been
pointed
out,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
that
even
that
profit
picture
was
distorted
and
it
was
unhealthy
and
the
testimony
showed
that
these
profits
had
been
squeezed
out
of
badly
needed
revenues
for
operating
expenses.
and
there
was
a
list
of
expenses
that
was
not
only
needed
but
which
the
acquiring
bank,
third
national
put
into
effect,
actually
extended
to
indicate
that
almost
the
entire
pre-tax
profits
were
necessary
to
put
trust
company
on
its
feet
as
annually
recurring
expenses,
in
addition
to
whatever
capital
expenditure
would
be
necessary.
the
largest
capital
expenditure
for
example,
was
the
one
that
was
actually
put
into
effect
and
to
create
the
funded
pension
plan
that
was
almost
half
a
million
dollars,
it
was
$400,000
plus.
now
i
would
like
to
get
to
what
we
consider
is
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
and
that
is,
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
new
law
had
its
primary
emphasis
placed
upon
creating
one
uniform
standards
for
use
by
courts
and
banking
authority
agencies
alike
in
judging
bank
mergers
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
congress
was
primarily
emphasizing
the
needs
for
courts
to
examine
the
so-called
banking
factors,
nevertheless
insofar
as
its
substantive
provision
are
concerned,
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
simply
did
no
more
than
codify
the
already
existing
failing
company
doctrine
that
was
in
antitrust
law
with
perhaps
slightly
expended
contours.
but
again,
their
position
indicates
that
in
spite
of
the
enormous
study
and
effort
that
went
into
this
new
law,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it's
considered
by
some
to
be
a
major
piece
of
legislation
for
the
89th
congress,
it
did
no
more
than
it
was
simply
codify
the
failing
company
doctrine
on
the
point.
mr.
e.
william
henry
well
i
agree,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
position
that
they
take
however
is
more
clearly
pointed
out
in
the
briefs
and
i
think
perhaps
they
stayed
away
from
it
in
oral
argument.
but
i
think
they
–
for
example,
in
attorney
general's
katzenbach's
letter
of
january
1966,
objecting
to
the
provisions
of
the
ashley-ottinger
proposal
which
was
in
effect,
and
active
into
the
bank
merger
law.
the
attorney
general
took
the
position
that
convenience
and
needs
should
be
considered
only
in
the
context
of
the
effect
on
competition,
and
the
likelihood
of
insolvency.
these
were
the
two
factors
that
the
attorney
general
said
should
be
considered
and
that
convenience
and
needs
should
be
considered
only
in
that
context.
now
in
the
reply
of
brief
of
the
government
at
page
16,
this
is
their
essential
position
at
the
bottom
of
page
16,
and
they
say
that
there
is
no
indication
that
the
bank,
trust
company,
was
inherently
unsound
that
it
was
facing
imminent
or
insoluble
financial
difficulties
or
dangers,
or
that
its
solvency
was
in
any
way
threatened.
in
short,
national
bank
was
not
a
floundering
bank.
that's
the
essence
of
their
position
it
seems
to
me
to
equate
a
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
well
i
don't
think
that
changed
their
basic
problem.
even
if
it
does,
i
think,
mr.
friedman's
colloquy
with
you
indicates
that
if
a
bank
does
have
alternative
methods
of
solving
its
very
serious
problems,
one
cannot
–
it's
not
even
necessary
to
inquire
into
the
service
to
convenience
and
needs.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
their
position
is
based
on
not
only
on
equating
the
floundering
or
stagnant
bank
with
the
failing
bank,
but
in
equating
the
banking
industry
with
every
other
industry.
and
considering
that
the
problems
associated
with
the
elimination
of
the
competitive
unit
in
the
banking
field
is
similar
to
the
elimination
of
a
company
in
any
other
field.
and
i
think
this
simply
misunderstands
the
responsibility
of
a
bank
not
only
to
serve
the
community,
but
to
get
its
assets
employed
in
a
fashion
that
may
not
produce
the
greatest
profits.
i
think
they
misunderstand
that
even
if
the
bank
has
been
demonstrated
to
meet
the
convenience
and
needs
test
then
somehow,
the
fact
that
mr.
weaver
showed
the
profit
on
it,
or
the
fact
that
he
listened
to
the
truth
as
explained
to
him
by
mr.
fleming,
that
somehow
his
profits
outweigh
the
public
interest
in
the
elimination
of
this
stagnant
institution.
mr.
e.
william
henry
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
think
it
reflects
on
that
certainly,
but
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
yes.
mr.
e.
william
henry
if
the
record
had
shown
that
this
had
been
offered
to
mr.
weaver's
group?
mr.
e.
william
henry
originally.
mr.
e.
william
henry
well
i
don't
get
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
e.
william
henry
that's
what
happened
in
effect,
is
it
not
that
the
weaver
group
came
along
which
was
not
in
the
banking
business
and
bought
the
bank
from
mr.
hill.
there
was
no
–
at
$350
of
share.
you
see
there
was
no
exchange
of
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
no,
that
was
the
first
purchase.
mr.
weaver
came
along
and
purchased
the
bank
from
mr.
hill
in
effect,
the
man
who
owned
the
grocery
channel
and
because
mr.
hill
needed
money
for
his
grocery,
and
he
paid
$350
of
share
cash
for
it.
mr.
e.
william
henry
then
he
subsequently
sold
out
to
the
third
national
bank.
mr.
e.
william
henry
after
the
original
process,
correct.
mr.
e.
william
henry
well
the
first
thing
i
would
point
out
of
course,
that
it
is
not
the
case
here
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
other
offer,
other
than
from
a
competitive
bank
in
the
county.
the
only
offers
that
mr.
weaver
received
were
from
two
competitive
banks.
now.
mr.
e.
william
henry
he
testified
that
he
although
the
problems
of
the
bank
had
been
indicated
to
him
originally,
he
did
not
understand
their
depth
and
their
scope
and
the
expense
of
a
corrective
measure.
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
whether
he
actively
sought
offers
or
whether
the
commerce
union
bank
and
the
third
national
first
approached
him.
i
think
the
later,
that
he
was
approached
originally
by
others
interested
in
it,
two
competitive
banks
in
the
county
approached
him.
mr.
e.
william
henry
for
merger.
mr.
e.
william
henry
that's
right.
that's
right,
they
wanted
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
he
was
approached
and
the
competitive
banks
approached
him,
i
think
as
early
as
one
month
after
his
acquisition.
the
merger
occurred
two
months
after
his
acquisition.
so
getting
back
to
your
question,
the
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
even
if
it
what
--
mr.
e.
william
henry
that's
certainly
a
large
part
of
our
contention,
yes.
because
we
think
that
the
question
of
the
stagnant
or
declining
institution
as
conceived
by
congress
was
aimed
primarily
at
increasing
this
--
the
banking
service
to
the
community,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
eliminated
as
a
competitive
unit
and
that
therefore
might
have
had
the
by
statistical
analysis
and
the
competitive
effects.
mr.
e.
william
henry
i
think
there
is
other
clear
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
the
proposition
that
it
met
the
needs
service,
that
it
brought
to
community
convenience
and
needs
clearly
outweighed
any
competitive
effects.
mr.
o'malley
is
going
to
discuss
what
those
banking
factors
are.
i
would
like
to
add
though
in
response
to
your
question
this
thought.
one
has
to
look
at
the
banking
business
as
it
operates
and
as
it
serves
the
public.
again,
in
looking
around
for
ultimate
purchasers,
how
far
does
the
owner
of
the
bank
have
to
go?
does
he
have
to
advertise
in
the
paper?
does
he
in
effect,
have
to
put
it
on
the
auction
block
and
sell
it
to
the
highest
bidder
other
than
a
competitive
bank?
to
what
extent
is
confidentiality
required
in
discussing
the
sale
of
the
bank
particularly
if
a
bank
has
problems?
how
far
and
how
long
should
mr.
weaver
have
looked
around?
the
record
shows
that
he
had
talked
to
some
13
prominent
people
both
inside
and
outside
of
national
to
see
if
he
could
--
to
see
if
they
had
any
suggestions
as
to
the
solution
to
this
bank's
problems.
he
found
none.
mr.
e.
william
henry
no
sir,
he
was
asking
them
what
in
effect
how
he
could
dissolve
the
problems
of
this
bank?
were
they
insoluble?
how
long
would
it
take
to
solve
them?
what
was
going
to
happen
to
the
bank
while
he
took
his
time
in
looking
around
for
new
management?
there
was
a
meeting
personnel
recruiter
who
testified
in
the
case
that
if
mr.
weaver
had
come
to
him
and
asked
him
to
find
a
management
team
for
him,
he
would
not
have
undertaken
the
job
because
he
did
not
feel
that
it
could
be
accomplished,
or
that
if
it
could
be
accomplished,
it
would
have
taken
years
and
the
doing.
so
what
we
are
saying
essentially
is
that
the
weaver
group
nor
indeed
any
purchaser
is
not
required
to
--
or
certainly
it
is
a
matter
of
judgment
as
to
how
long
he
is
required
to
conduct
this
inquiry.
how
far
he
is
to
go
in
revealing
the
problems
of
the
bank,
and
the
degree
to
which
he
must
look
around
for
other
purchasers.
mr.
e.
william
henry
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
william
henry
no,
i
did
not
say
declining
earnings.
i
say
the
declining
relative
position
in
the
market.
mr.
e.
william
henry
it
had
never
--
yes.
it
had
shown
a
continuing
increase
in
profits.
the
evidence
indicated
however
had
it
made
the
necessary
expenditures
to
overcome
the
problems
that
i
outlined.
for
example
it
cost
$51,000
annually
recurring
in
addition
to
an
$80,000
initial
investment
to
establish
one
branch.
they
had
only
one,
if
they
had
built
three
branches
or
four
branches,
they
would
have
shown
no
profit
or
whatsoever,
nor
have
they
had
any
money
leftover
for
capital
expenditures,
nor
if
they
need
to
pay
capital
dividends.
now
the
government
made
--
the
government
after
the
time
of
the
trial
in
its
brief
indicated
that
the
court
was
required
to
consider
the
effect
on
the
competition
of
--
and
on
the
public
interest
of
an
acquisition
by
competitive
bank
in
davidson
county.
they
indicated
that
the
law
requires
that
alternate
purchasers
be
considered
and
that
this
record
showed
that
there
was
an
alternate
purchaser
namely
the
commerce
union
bank,
that
was
a
smaller
bank,
and
that
therefore,
the
district
court
erred
because
it
did
not
consider
this
as
an
alternative
less
anticompetitive
solution
to
the
merger.
now
i
think
again,
this
indicates
the
deficiencies
of
the
rationale
of
the
government.
they
found
that
the
state,
that
this
merger
itself
would
have
been
anticompetitive,
would
have
combine
26%
of
the
banking
assets
in
the
community,
would
have
combined
35%
of
the
banking
offices
in
the
community,
and
would
have
resulted
in
exactly
the
same
degree
of
concentration
in
the
market,
in
the
top
three
banks
that
resulted
from
this
merger.
and
yet
they
say,
that's
a
less
anticompetitive
solution
and
vitiates
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
that
this
merger
was
lawful.
to
windup
my
part,
i
would
like
to
comment
just
briefly
on
the
trial
judge's
opinion
in
that
respect.
the
government
for
much
of
its
brief,
indicates
that
the
trial
judge's
reference
to
the
columbia
steel
case
in
effect
fatally
undermined
his
judgment
here.
i
think
he
had
two
problems
with
that.
first
of
all,
he
simply
indicated
that
he
felt
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
was
analogous
to
the
rule
of
reason.
that
in
weighing,
convenience
and
needs
against
anticompetitive
effects,
this
required
a
balancing
of
other
than
the
usual
section
7
considerations
although
he
realized
that
section
7
considerations
were
also
involved.
secondly,
he
considered
and
weighed
every
factual
matter
that
this
court
has
thought
under
its
section
7
considerations
pertained
to
mergers.
and
he
stated
in
his
opinion,
that
under
those,
what
he
called
pre-1966
standards,
the
government
had
established
an
arguable
case.
we
think
this
indicates
that
his
reference
was
left
to
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
not
simply
that
the
methods
by
which
anticompetitive
effects
would
be
considered
under
section
7
had
been
changed
and
as
indicated,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
case
was
decided
prior
to
this
court's
decision
of
houston.
mr.
e.
william
henry
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
one
or
two
points
before
i
close.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
appellee
banks,
the
floundering
bank
question
in
its
elimination
as
a
competitive
unit,
can
have
considerations
that
pertain
both
to
the
anticompetitive
effects
question
and
the
convenience
and
needs
question.
but
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
while
the
problems
with
respect
to
the
anticompetitive
effects
are
rather
apparent
when
we
are
dealing
with
this
stagnant
institution
because
in
many
respects
it
will
not
be
competing
effectively,
the
court
should
not
overlook
the
very
important
thrust
of
the
legislative
debated
of
the
law
itself.
it
seemed
to
emphasize
in
addition
to
the
competitive
questions
that
surround
the
elimination
or
the
operation
of
a
stagnant
institution.
the
manner,
the
fact
that
such
an
institution
also
very
often
fails
to
provide
certain
banking
services
to
the
community
even
though
it
maybe
rendering
some
competition
which
would
be
eliminated
by
the
merger.
so
one
has
to
look
at
both
sides
of
that
question,
both
sides
of
what
the
government
refers
to
as
the
equation
when
we're
talking
about
a
stagnant
institution.
also,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
do
feel
that
this
record
indicates
quite
clearly
that
there
are
--
that
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
was
met
by
this
merger
in
increasing
and
bringing
better
service
to
the
community
totally
apart
from
the
anticompetitive
considerations
involved.
now
the
reason
i
said
that
i
thought
that
the
government's
equation
or
analysis
of
this
law,
in
effect
was
limited
pretty
much
to
the
failing
company
doctrine
is
because,
as
emphasized
rather
heavily
in
their
original
brief,
they
seem
to
say
that
community
needs
and
services
are
some
new
and
important
kind
of
service
not
being
rendered
by
any
bank
in
the
community.
and
i
don't
know
what
they
are
talking
about
on
air
pollution,
or
traffic
safety,
or
what,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
consider
banking
services
when
you
are
considering
convenience
and
needs.
but
if
you
read
out
of
it
almost
as
they
do,
the
convenience
and
needs
question,
then
you
get
over
to
the
anticompetitive
side,
and
then
you
limit
yourself
to
that.
and
then
they
say,
“we're
back
to
the
failing
company
doctrine
in
the
look
for
alternative
purchases,
etcetera.”
so
i
think
in
this
case,
we
had
the
elimination
of
a
bank
as
a
competitive
unit.
that
not
only
was
failing
to
render
the
kind
of
services
that
it
should
and
therefore
was
failing
to
compete
as
effectively
as
it
should,
but
also
from
a
convenience
and
needs
point
of
view,
was
failing
to
render
to
the
public
apart
from
competitive
considerations,
the
kind
of
service
that
the
public
in
nashville
was
entitled
to
receive
from
each
banking
unit
and
the
customers
of
that
banking
unit
some
10,000
strong
were
not
receiving
those
services.
mr.
e.
william
henry
well,
i
think
it
is
a
--
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe
that
what
the
government
urges
should
be
done,
can
be
done.
they
are
urging
some
sort
of
a
conceptual
pigeonholing
of
the
various
factors.
mr.
e.
william
henry
and
i
think
what
the
court
--
what
this
court
should
look
at
is
--
what
it
looked
at
in
the
seaboard
air
line
railroad
company
versus
united
states
court
when
they
were
under
evaluation,
the
icc's
approval
of
a
merger.
and
there
they
found
that
the
failure
of
the
icc
to
find
the
section
7
violation
was
not
necessary
as
long
as
all
the
factual
matters
involved
in
the
anticompetitive
effects
question
were
examined,
and
the
impact
on
competition
was
examined.
i
think
that
is
the
question
that
this
court
should
look
at
and
not
simply
a
reference
to
a
case
that
stands
for
the
rule
of
reason.
so
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
to
--
that
this
court
should
examine
whether
the
district
court
looked
at
all
of
those
factors.
if
it
did,
its
opinion
should
be
affirmed.
if
it
found
that
it
didn't,
that
it
failed
to
look
at
all
those
factors,
i
assume
that
he
should
be
required
to
reexamine
those
factors
under
the
appropriate
standard.
thank
you.
