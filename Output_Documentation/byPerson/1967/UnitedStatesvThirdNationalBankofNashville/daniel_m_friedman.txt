mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
individual
employees
did
not
have
a
vested
interest
in
the
plan
and
apparently
this
was
considered
a
serious
problem
to
the
bank
and
finally,
this
bank,
unlike
the
larger
banks,
did
not
have
any
automated
equipment
or
even
semi-automated
equipment.
it
did
not
have
a
computer.
despite
these
problems,
the
weaver
and
his
group
decided
to
go
ahead
and
to
buy
controlling
interest
of
the
bank
which
they
did
for
a
price
at
about
$3,780,000.
they
paid
$350
a
share
for
this
stock
and
apparently,
the
price
they
paid
reflected
some
of
the
problems
of
the
bank
because
a
financial
study
that
was
prepared
for
the
bank
at
the
time
of
this
acquisition,
start
to
pay
it
for
mr.
hill,
indicated
that
this
stock
was
being
purchased
at
15
½
times
earnings
whereas,
stocks
of
other
banks
in
the
south
eastern
united
states
were
being
sold
at
18
½
times
earnings.
and
at
the
trial
weaver
explained
that
the
stocks
of
the
banks
that
were
priced
at
a
substantially
higher
earnings
multiple
were
not
comparable
and
the
reason
he
explained
that,
it's
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
502
of
the
record
was
he
said,
speaking
to
mr.
weinbaum,
our
trial
counsel,
these
banks
that
are
being
compared,
mr.
weinbaum,
most
of
them
are
fully
automated.
they
have
funded
pension
plans.
they
have
an
adequate
branching
system.
their
headquarters
and
their
branches
are
modernized,
you
simply
can't
compare
on
that
basis.
now,
mr.
weaver
testified
that
his
group
originally
bought
the
stock
as
an
investment
and
that
that
no
intention
of
selling
the
bank
or
merging
it.
but
he
said
that
after
they
had
looked
into
the
problems
of
the
bank
a
little
more,
they
decided
they
were
even
worst
than
they
had
anticipated.
he
said
they
smoked
to
a
lot
of
people
they
knew
in
the
banking
field
for
advice,
how
to
solve
the
problems
of
this
bank,
but
they
would
tell
that
the
problems
were
very,
very
difficult
and
that
would
be
almost
impossible
they
were
told
to
find
a
replacement
for
mr.
hackworth,
the
president
of
the
bank.
they
also
said
they
discovered
it
would
cost
more
than
they
had
anticipated
to
fund
the
pension
plan,
the
locations
for
branches
were
very
difficult
to
find
and
they
were
very
expensive
and
so
the
result
of
these
discoveries,
they
started
serious
discussion
with
a
mr.
fleming,
the
president
of
third
national
bank
who
made
the
purchase.
at
the
bottom
of
page
515
of
the
record,
mr.
weaver
explained
the
role
mr.
fleming
played
in
persuading
him
to
make
the
sale
and
this
is
what
he
said.
he
said
mr.
fleming
is
a
great
salesman
and
he
sold
beyond
the
idea
and
my
associates
that
the
problems,
the
great
problems
of
this
bank
could
best
be
solved
through
a
merger
with
the
third
national
bank
and
that
the
best
interest
of
a
stockholders,
the
employees,
the
officers,
and
the
national
community
would
be
best
served
through
a
merger.
and
the
same
thought
was
repeated
page
535
when
he
was
asked,
“would
you
say
that
mr.
fleming
more
than
any
other
single
person
illuminated
the
problems
of
the
trust
company
for
you”
and
mr.
weaver
replied,
“yes,
i
would
say
that
he
did.
he
certainly
very
forcefully
brought
to
our
attention
the
problems”
and
then
he
added
of
course,
you
must
remember
that
we
have
already
discovered
many
of
these
problems
when
we
started
our
study
in
depth.
two
months,
after
that
mr.
weaver
group
purchased
the
bank
for
$350
of
share,
it
sold
it
to
the
third
national
in
exchange
for
stock
of
the
third
national
which
then
had
a
value
of
between
$405
or
to
$420
a
share
or
roughly
a
profit
of
between
$600
and
$760,000
on
the
investment
of
three
and
three
quarter
million
dollars.
now
interestingly
enough,
this
was
not
the
first
time
since
he
had
purchased
the
stock
that
mr.
weaver
had
discussed
the
possibility
of
a
merger.
about
two
weeks
after
he
purchased
the
stock,
he
had
the
discussions
with
the
president
of
the
commerce
union
bank
which
was
the
third
largest
bank
in
nashville
that
was
also
interested
in
buying
the
stock.
now
weaver
testified
that
he
was
at
that
point
not
particularly
interested
in
selling
because
he
had
purchased
the
stock
for
investment
that
they
had
discussed
the
possible
exchange
of
commerce
union
and
nashville
bank
stock
and
the
commerce
union
had
offered
them
only
10
shares
for
one
which
was
worth
just
about
$360
a
share
and
he
wasn’t
interested.
the
president
of
commerce
union
on
the
other
hand
testified
that
negotiations
terminated
because
they
couldn’t'
get
together
on
price
that
they
were
talking
about
10
to
one,
and
mr.
weaver
is
talking
about
13
to
one
and
roughly
$100
more.
after
the
approval
of
the
merger
by
the
boards
of
directors
of
the
two
banks,
it
was
submitted
as
the
same
required
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960
to
the
controller
of
the
currency
for
his
approval,
his
approval
was
necessary
before
a
merger
could
be
consummated.
and
as
the
statute
required
the
controller
sought
of
use
of
the
two
other
banking
agencies
and
of
the
department
of
justice.
that
is
the
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
system
and
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company.
all
three
of
these
agencies
advised
the
control
of
that
in
their
view
the
merger
would
have
significant
anticompetitive
consequences.
the
controller
nevertheless
approved
the
merger
and
the
government
within
a
week
filed
a
suit
and
sought
a
preliminary
injunction
to
stay
the
merger,
pending
the
completion
of
the
trial.
after
hearing
the
district
court
denied
the
injunction
on
the
18th
of
august
1964,
the
merger
took
place
the
same
day.
before
the
case
came
to
trial,
however,
the
congress
passed
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
which
in
terms
applied
to
this
case
because
it
was
a
case
that
was
pending
at
that
time
and
under
that
statute
as
it
permits
the
control
of
the
currency
intervened
in
the
district
court
in
opposition
to
the
government's
case
and
he
is
appearing
before
this
court
today,
supporting
the
position
of
the
appellee
banks.
after
a
lengthy
trial,
the
district
court
held
for
the
defendants
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
court
ruled
that
under
the
1966
bank
merger
act,
the
standards
for
determining
the
anticompetitive
effect
of
a
merger,
are
not
those
that
traditionally
have
been
applied
in
section
7
of
merger
cases,
but
rather
that
the
standards
were
those
that
this
court
had
applied
in
1948
in
the
columbia
steel
decision,
a
section
1
case
involving
a
corporate
acquisition.
and
that
case
by
the
way
significantly
we
think
in
this
court's
lexington
bank
decision
about
three
years
ago,
this
court
stated
the
case
was
to
be
confined
to
its
own
special
facts.
the
district
court
also
indicated
that
in
deciding
the
competitive
impact,
it
was
appropriately
considered
not
only
competitive
factors
but
also
the
so-called
banking
factors
which
are
a
matter
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
convenience
and
needs
defense.
and
the
court
concluded
at
pages
7
--
97
and
98
in
its
opinion,
that
he
said
although
the
plaintiff
has
established
an
arguable
case
for
condemnation
of
the
merger
under
the
pre
1966
standards
of
the
lexington
philadelphia
and
other
cases.
treating
davidson
county
is
the
relevant
geographic
market
and
commercial
banking
as
the
services
or
products
market,
the
merger
is
not
violated
of
the
new
antitrust
standards
of
the
1966
amendment.
and
then
as
i've
indicated,
the
court
went
on
and
made
findings
of
its
own
that
at
any
event,
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
this
merger
clearly
will
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
now,
we
think
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
wrong
in
its
view
that
in
the
1966
bank
merger
act,
congress
intended
to
change
the
substantive
standards
for
determining
the
anticompetitive
effect
of
a
bank
merger?
in
its
houston
bank
opinion
last
term,
although
in
a
somewhat
different
context,
this
court
stated
that
congress
intended
that
a
defense
or
justification
be
available.
once
that
it
had
been
determined,
that
a
transaction
would
have
anticompetitive
effects
as
judged
by
the
standards
and
normally
applied
in
antitrust
cases.
the
language
which
congress
used
in
this
section
with
the
one
exception
that
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute
that
it
does
not
contain
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce,
is
identical
to
the
language
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
that
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it
was
mr.
justice.
the
language
is
that
the
effect
of
which
is
effective
in
any
section
of
the
country
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
and
it
seemed
that
when
you're
dealing
with
a
statute
involving
mergers,
like
this
one
is
specialized
type
of
merger,
and
where
congress
has
inserted
a
special
defense,
it
requires
a
very
clear
showing
that
with
congress
use
the
identical
language
in
the
clayton
act,
it
really
intended
a
different
standard.
not
only
is
there
no
such
evidence
in
the
legislative
history,
but
as
we
developed
in
the
reply
brief
we
have
filed,
the
sponsors
of
this
legislation
indicated
that
they
did
intend
the
standards
to
be
applied
in
determining
competitive
effect
to
be
those
traditionally
applied
under
the
sherman
and
clayton
act.
for
example
the
congressman
patman
who
was
responsible
of
the
bill
that
was
finally
enacted
and
whose
statement
is
in
this
court,
“relied
on
heavily
on
the
houston
bank
case
stated
that
the
competitive
standard
to
be
applied
is
clearly
that
of
the
sherman
and
the
clayton
act.
because
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
what
congress
did
in
this
statute
was
to
provide
that
you
determine
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
a
bank
merger
the
same
as
you'd
always
determined
anticompetitive
effects,
but
then
provided
a
limited
exception,
there
were
certain
situations
where
the
anticompetitive
effects
if
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
in
need
of
the
community
to
be
served
would
suffice
to
validate
an
otherwise
anticompetitive
merger.
and
that
is
it
seems
to
me
in
this
all
setting
a
part
of
the
balancing
factor
that
consideration
of
special
factors
applicable
to
banking
play
their
part,
but
only
there.
they
do
not
play
their
part
in
determining
competitive
injury
in
the
sense
that
a
different
standard
is
to
be
used
where
a
determining
competitive
injury
for
banks.
now
the
controller
makes
another
argument.
the
controller
argues
that
because
in
this
statute
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce
do
not
appear
whereas
they
do
appear
in
the
clayton
act,
this
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
in
bank
merger
cases
henceforth
the
relevant
product
line
was
to
be
something
broader
than
commercial
banking
which
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
was
irrelevant
product
market,
it
was
intended
to
encompass
all
financial
institutions
that
is
savings
and
loan
associations,
insurance
companies,
credit
unions,
any
groups
that
make
financing
available
to
the
community.
the
district
court
rejected
these
arguments,
saying
that
he
couldn't
be
assumed
that
congress
would
have
made
such
a
significant
change
by
mere
omission
and
he
also
said
there
was
no
really
significant
legislative
history
to
support
the
contention.
we
fully
agree
with
that.
we
again
have
discussed
in
our
reply
brief
that
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
establishes
that
by
not
using
the
words
in
this
case,
congress
intended
to
change
the
standard
for
determining
the
appropriate
product
market,
a
standard
which
this
court
has
twice
upheld
is
properly
permits
the
treatment
of
commercial
banking
as
the
relevant
line
of
commerce.
in
addition,
the
point
i
previously
made
that
there
is
no
showing
of
any
intend
on
the
part
of
congress
to
change
the
substantive
standards
also
applies
here
because
the
determination
of
the
relevant
product
market
we
think
is
an
integral
element
of
determining
competitive
effect.
now
we
think
that
under
the
proper
standard
for
determining
anticompetitive
effect
that
the
effect
of
this
merger
clearly
was
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
as
i've
indicated,
the
national
banking
market
in
davidson
county
was
highly
concentrated.
three
of
the
banks
had
93%
of
the
market.
the
merger
increased
concentration
to
98%
and
none
of
the
remaining
banks
had
more
than
1%
of
the
market.
now
this
court's
decision
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
recognized
that
a
merger
would
result
within
a
combination
controlling
30%
of
the
market
threatens
undue
concentration.
and
the
court's
opinion
also
pointed
out
that
if
concentration
is
already
great,
the
importance
of
preventing
even
slight
increases
in
concentration
and
so
preserving
the
possibility
or
eventual
decontrol
is
correspondingly
great
and
we
think
that
is
precisely
this
case,
highly
concentrated
a
further
substantial
indicate
increase
in
control.
and
moreover
this
merger
eliminated
the
only
middle-sized
bank
in
the
community.
what
you
have
after
this
merger
is
three
very
large
banks
and
four
very
small
banks.
the
middle-sized
bank,
the
one
that
seem
to
us
is
the
most
powerful
source
of
some
possible
ability
of
deconcentration
has
been
eliminated.
now
the
district
court
found
in
this
case,
and
the
appellee
has
vigorously
argued,
that
national
bank
was
not
a
meaningful
or
substantial
competitor
in
the
national
community.
the
argument
was
that
because
it
wasn't
as
modern,
and
as
efficient,
and
as
effective
as
some
of
the
other
banks,
there
was
not
a
meaningful
competitive.
this
argument,
we
think
rests
on
a
mistaken
notion,
of
kind
of
competition,
section
7
is
designed
to
protect.
and
if
you
have
a
bank
like
this
that
was
have
been
growing,
that
has
a
substantial
share
of
the
market,
we
think
it
is
definitely
a
significant
competitor
whose
elimination
poses
the
kind
of
competitive
threat
that
section
7
was
designed
to
reach
even
though
it
may
not
have
used
the
most
modern
merchandising
methods,
the
most
up
to
date
business
techniques.
admittedly
this
fact
may
not
have
been
the
most
efficient
competitor
in
the
market,
it
didn't
have
any
significant
number
of
branches,
it
was
not
aggressive
--
as
aggressive
as
some
of
the
others
in
competing
from
the
business,
but
nevertheless
we
think
it
was
and
the
record
shows
a
significant
competitor
in
this
market.
the
presidents
of
the
two
other
largest
banks
that
is
other
than
third
national,
who
presumably
are
in
as
good
a
position
as
anyone
to
know
what
kind
of
a
competitive
this
bank
is
testified
that
national
bank
was
a
vigorous
and
effective
competitor.
now
because
of
its
much
smaller
size,
and
national
bank
was
only
perhaps
seven
third,
eight
is
large
as
these
big
banks,
because
of
its
smaller
size,
it
naturally
tended
to
the
medium
size
and
smaller
accounts,
and
to
the
medium-sized
and
smaller
businesses
in
the
community.
the
president
of
the
third
largest
bank,
commerce
union
testified
that
they
had
encountered
nashville
bank
in
soliciting
these
smaller
and
medium-sized
accounts,
and
that
will
indeed
meet
them,
we
found
that
the
competition
was
very
aggressive
and
we
knew
that
they
were
there.
they
said
that
they
have
hackworth
joined
the
bank
in
1956
as
they
said;
they
became
quite
aggressive
in
direct
consumer
loan
business.
the
president
of
the
largest
bank,
first
america,
also
gave
similar
testimony.
he
said
that
in
late
1963
and
1964,
his
chief
rivals
in
nashville
were
the
two
other
large
banks
and
nashville
trust,
that
in
recent
years,
competition
between
his
bank
and
national
trust
for
demand
deposits
was
very
keen,
and
that
national
bank
was
a
major
competitive
therefore
and
he
said
that
in
1963
and
1964
just
before
the
merger,
national
bank
was
that
he
described
it
a
major
competitor
for
the
smaller
industrial
and
commercial
loan.
another
indication
as
to
the
role
national
bank
played
in
this
market
and
as
to
the
competitive
injury
that
resulted
from
its
elimination
was
that
this
bank
provided
its
customers
with
certain
advantages
not
furnished
by
the
other
banks.
for
example,
national
bank
had
lower
service
charges
on
its
checking
accounts
than
did
--
the
other
large
banks.
that's
shown
by
an
exhibit
at
page
1180
of
the
record
in
volume
3,
the
district
court
said
this
was
insignificant
because
it
said
the
amount
of
deposits
to
which
these
lower
service
charges
applied
were
only
4%
of
national
bank's
demand
deposits.
well
that's
true
and
the
reason
that
it's
true
is
because
these
lowered
charges
on
checking
accounts
are
only
significant
on
small
accounts
when
you
have
a
huge
account
with
thousands
of
checks,
they
don't
charge
you
so
much
for
check.
they
work
something
t
it,
is
precisely
in
dealing
with
the
smaller
depositor
who
had
$300
or
$500
in
deposit
that
the
lower
service
charge
on
the
checks
was
significant.
the
record
also
shows
that
there
were
at
least
two
small
businessmen
who
were
able
to
get
loans
from
the
nashville
bank
after
they
had
been
turned
down
by
one
of
the
large
banks.
and
one
of
these
witnesses,
a
man
named
dole,
when
it
was
asked
the
effect
of
a
merger
on
small
borrower
such
as
himself,
explained
very
cautiously
why
he
thought
a
merger
like
this
had
a
bad
effect.
he
said,
i
think
the
page
862,
top
of
the
page,
i
think
the
more
outlets
you
have,
the
more
opportunities
to
seek
or
search
for
a
loan,
the
better
opportunities
you
have
got.
so
to
sum
up
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
we
think
nashville
bank
was
a
significant
factor
in
the
market
and
that
its
elimination
by
a
merger,
which
significantly
increased
concentration
in
the
market,
the
effect
of
this
maybe
substantial
to
lessen
competition
as
this
phrase
has
been
defined
in
the
cases
under
section
7.
now,
we
also
think
that
the
district
court's
error
in
determining
competitive
effect,
necessarily
in
fact
that
its
other
determination
that
any
anticompetitive
effects
were
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
the
statute
permits
an
anticompetitive
merger
to
be
approved
only
if
these
community
benefits
clearly
outweigh,
not
outweighed,
clearly
outweigh
the
anticompetitive
effect
and
we
don't
see
how
that
determination
can
possibly
be
made
in
a
vacuum
without
first
determining
precisely
how
significant
the
anticompetitive
effects
are.
now
the
banks
attempt
to
justify
the
lower
court's
decision
on
the
theory
that
whether
or
not,
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
assessment
of
anticompetitive
consequences
in
any
event
it
was
clearly
correct
in
concluding
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
outweighed,
i
am
sorry,
that
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
outweighed
the
anticompetitive
effect.
but
this
it
seems
to
us,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
statute
under
which
the
all
setting
community
benefits
is
an
alternative
ground
for
upholding
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
this
is
a
different
kind
of
a
statute.
there
is
basically
three
elements
under
this
statute.
first
you
determine
anticompetitive
effects;
if
there
are
no
anticompetitive
effects,
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry,
the
merger
is
permissible.
second
if
you
determine
there
are
anticompetitive
effects,
you
then
ascertain
what
the
effect
of
the
merger
is
and
the
public
and
meaning,
the
public
interest
of
the
community
in
convenience
in
necessity
term.
and
then
after
you
made
that
assessment,
then
you
must
balance
the
two
to
see
whether
the
community
benefits
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest,
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest,
the
anticompetitive
effects
that
have
been
found
and
it
seems
to
us
you
can't
possibly
make
a
reasoned
and
careful
judgment
on
the
later
question
where
it
does
clearly
outweigh
unless
you
have
given
fair
weight
to
the
anticompetitive
effects.
now
we
think
however
that
over
and
beyond
this,
the
district
court's
determination
on
convenience
of
the
needs
of
the
community
as
subject
to
a
further
flow,
the
failure
of
the
district
court
to
recognize
that
the
problems
of
the
nashville
bank
could
be
solved
by
some
step
short
of
an
anticompetitive
merger.
the
banks
argue
that
that
is
not
a
relevant
inquiry
under
this
statute.
they
suggest
that
it's
a
very
simple
inquiry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
did,
mr.
justice.
we
have
again
in
our
reply
brief
set
forth
in
a
footnote
precisely
what
we
said
on
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
district
court
addressed
itself
only
in
one
footnote.
it
didn't
discuss
it
in
its
opinion
because
in
its
opinion,
the
court
did
not
reach
these
things.
the
court
did
make
one
finding
saying
that
because
of
the
age
of
various
of
these
individuals
and
some
other
problems,
it
was
virtually
impossible
that
the
problems
of
the
bank
could
be
solved
by
anything
other
than
a
merger
and
we
of
course,
do
challenge
that
finding.
now
the
banks
argue
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
reach
this
issue
because
they
say,
all
you
have
to
do
is
all
that
statute
says
is,
is
you
look
to
see
the
anticompetitive
effects.
you
look
in
the
all
say
community
benefits,
and
then
you
make
a
determination
whether
the
community
benefits
outweigh
the
anticompetitive
effect
and
if
you
found
that
it
does,
that's
the
end
of
it.
but
of
course,
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
statute
says
that
these
community
benefits
must
clearly
outweigh
in
the
public
interest
the
anticompetitive
effect.
reverting
for
a
moment
again
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
houston
bank
case,
this
court
recognized
that
under
this
statute
antitrust
standards
would
have
been
the
norm
and
anticompetitive
bank
mergers
the
exception
and
we
don't
think
that
in
the
light
of
this
congress
ever
intended
to
permit
a
bank
merger
that
was
anticompetitive
to
be
approved
if
there
was
some
other
way
of
solving
the
bank's
problems,
that
is
another
way
of
accomplishing
the
needs
and
convenience
of
the
community
that
would
not
pose
this
anticompetitive
effects.
so
this
it
seems
does
brings
us
to
the
question
of
whether
the
bank's
problems
were
exceptional,
that
only
a
merger
could
solve
them
and
that
requires
consideration
of
two
things;
first
the
problems,
and
secondly,
the
steps
that
the
weaver
group
he
took
an
attempt
to
solve
them.
everyone
agrees
that
the
primary
problem
of
this
bank
was
management
that
mr.
hackworth
was
getting
old.
there
was
necessary
to
find
a
replacement
for
him
as
well
as
some
others.
mr.
weaver
testified
that
their
solution
to
this
problem
was
they
went
around
and
talked
to
a
number
of
people
they
knew
in
the
banking
business.
they
had
a
lot
of
contacts
and
they
said
they
spoke
to
a
lot
of
people
in
the
banking
business,
and
they
spoke
to
them
at
length,
and
these
people
told
them,
the
problem
was
inside
of
it.
they
did
not
attempt
to
hire
a
management
recruiting
firm
to
see
if
they
could
find
at
president
because
as
he
explained
it,
all
they
relied
primarily,
as
he
described
it,
all
of
the
connections
they
had.
the
government
introduced
as
a
rebuttal
witness,
a
man
named
mills
who
is
from
specialized
in
bank
personnel
recruitment.
he
testified
that
he
had
at
that
time
between
a
150
and
200
existing
bank
presidents
who
were
interested
in
making
a
change.
he
also
had
a
150
to
180
top
executive
officers
who
were
interested
in
making
the
change
that
he
had
placed
over
the
past
five
years,
an
average
of
better
than
five
bank
presidents
and
12
vice
presidents
that
he
had
a
large
number
of
increase
every
year
from
banks
seeking
top
executive
officers.
and
now
these
men
that
were
available,
he
testified
about
20%
where
either
southerners
or
would
be
willing
to
work
in
the
set.
and
at
page
909
of
the
record,
he
made
it
this
very
significant
statement
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
he
said,
“it's
been
my
experience
over
these
30
years
and
10
years
from
the
employer's
side
that
any
bank
which
sincerely
wants
and
needs
executive
management,
and
is
wiling
to
pay
adequate
compensation
for
it,
will
have
no
trouble
in
finding
it.
we
can
supply
bankers
to
any
section
of
the
country.
”
and
then
a
few
lines
down
and
does
the
question
–
and
does
the
opinion
you
have
just
expressed
still
apply
having
considered
the
facts
of
this
case,”
the
answer,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
witness
a
man
named
mr.
mills.
unfortunately
mr.
chief
justice,
we
did
not
cite
his
testimony
in
our
brief.
he
was
a
rebuttal
witness
who
testified,
he
specializes
in
bank
personnel
recruitment.
he
also
of
course,
testified
that
he
had
not
been
approached
to
find
any
officers
for
the
nashville
bank
nor
did
to
any
people
in
the
weaver
group
approached
non-bankers
in
the
community
to
see
whether
they
might
be
interested,
other
business
people,
whether
they
might
be
interested
in
joining
the
bank
although,
the
man
whom
everyone
thinks
was
responsible
for
the
growth
of
the
bank,
mr.
hackworth,
prior
to
joining
the
bank
had
been
the
president
of
the
railroad.
now
we
think
this
is
similar.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
the
other
problems
of
this
bank
was
so
insurmountable
that
only
a
merger
would
solve
them.
concededly
the
bank
had
problems
and
undoubtedly
would
have
cost
some
money
to
solve
it.
they
may
have
to
increase
some
of
the
salaries
that
they
were
paying
and
they
may
have
had
to
reinvest
in
the
business,
some
of
the
substantial
earnings
of
this
bank
although
i
might
mention
in
passing
of
course,
that
to
whatever
extent,
additional
capital
was
reinvested
in
the
bank
and
improvements
presumably,
it
will
be
subsequently
reflected
in
greater
earnings.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that
they're
going
up
mr.
chief
justice
--
this
is
after
taxes,
they've
gone
up
from
$99,000
in
1959
to
$368,000
after
taxes
the
year
before
the
merger.
the
before
tax
earnings
i
think
was
something
like
$480,000
to
$500,000
--
$565,000
in
the
last
year
before
the
merger.
the
net
operating
income
of
the
bank
had
increased
in
every
year
from
1959
to
1963.
the
district
court
and
its
findings,
findings
55
to
64,
pages
118
to
121
of
the
records,
details
in
great
minutia,
the
increase
the
bank
had
enjoyed
in
the
various
indicia
of
banking
operations.
they've
found
that
in
respect
of
many
of
these
functions,
nashville
bank
had
a
greater
rate
of
growth
than
any
other
bank
in
the
country.
and
even
after
1959,
when
the
bank
allegedly
had
reached
the
plateau,
it
was
still
increasing
at
a
significant
rate
although
not
spectacularly
as
before.
for
example,
between
june
1959
and
june
1963,
four
years
before
the
merger,
the
banks
total
assets
and
the
bank's
total
deposits
increased
to
total
of
40%,
roughly
10%
a
year.
and
its
total
loans
in
the
same
period
increased
about
26%
a
year
roughly
6
1/2
%
a
year.
and
we
think
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
stagnant,
this
is
not
a
stagnating
or
floundering
bank.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
institution
that
congress
intended
under
the
bank
merger
act
that
an
anticompetitive
merger
could
be
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
rely
on
two
things,
mr.
justice,
i
would
say.
first,
we
rely
on
the
language,
the
use
of
the
words
clearly
outweigh
in
the
public
interest.
we
think
these
are
broad
phrases
which
do
require
it
and
secondly,
we
rely
on
the
basic
theme
of
the
act.
the
basic
theme
of
the
act
that
anticompetitive
mergers
are
to
be
permitted
only
in
a
limited
exception
where
it's
clearly
outweighed
by
the
community
needs
an
interest,
convenience
and
interest.
and
we
think
that
under
that
kind
of
statute,
that
it
is
not
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
where
there
is
another
method
of
solving
the
bank's
problems
does
not
pose
the
anticompetitive
difference
that
a
merger
does.
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
would
put
it
this
way
if
i
may,
mr.
justice.
we
do
think
that
this
court
should
lay
down
the
rule
that
a
merger
that
has
anticompetitive
effects
cannot
be
justified
if
in
fact
it
appears
from
the
record
that
there
are
alternative
methods
for
solving
its
problems.
now
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice,
the
extent
to
which
they
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
would
think,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
because
the
statute
says
that
the
anticompetitive
merger
is
bad
unless
it
is
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
public.
now,
whenever
people
buy
a
new
business,
they
expect
a
period
of
uncertainties
and
changes.
the
weaver
group
was
well
aware
that
this
bank
had
problems
when
it
ported
in
this.
i've
indicated
the
price
they
paid
apparently
reflected
these
problems.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
--
let
me
put
it
if
i
may
approach
the
question
a
little
differently.
i
think
that
there
are
two
ways
the
problems
of
the
bank
like
this
might
be
solved.
one
way
is
to
make
the
bank
itself
to
make
various
internal
changes.
another
way
would
be
to
sell
the
bank
out
in
a
situation
where
there
was
no
anticompetitive
effect.
that
is
for
example,
the
sale
of
the
bank
by
the
hill
and
hackworth
interest
to
the
weaver
group
on
its
face
had
no
anticompetitive.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
would
think
they
should
be
some
showing
on
the
applied
that
they
at
least
have
attempted,
at
least
have
attempted
to
see
if
there
was
anyone
else
who
was
interested
in
it.
let
me
–
if
i
may
put
the
case
a
little
differently,
if
all
we
show
is
anticompetative
effects
and
there
was
an
offer,
there
was
an
offer
and
immediately
it
was
accepted
an
attractive
offer,
i
doubt,
i
think
that's
enough
for
us
to
prevail.
they
have
to
show
something
more
than
that.
and
in
this
case,
what
we
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
have
to,
mr.
justice,
i
mean
they
have
to
make
reasonable
efforts
to
see
if
there
are
not
some
ways
show
of
a
merger
that
could
solve
this
bank's
problems.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely,
mr.
justice,
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
we
think
this
is
implicit
in
the
standard
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest.
there's
two
phrases;
clearly
outweighed
and
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
statutory
test
is
set
forth
at
page
37
of
our
brief
that
a
proposed
anticompetitive
merger
is
illegal
unless
it
finds
and
that's
either
the
court
or
an
agency
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
proposed
transaction
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
think
the
convenience
and
need
of
the
so-called
banking
factors,
but
we
think
that
even
though
after
you
evaluate
what
the
benefits
to
the
community
are
in
determining
whether
these
benefits
clearly
outweigh
in
the
public
interest,
the
anticompetitive
effect,
you
have
to
look
and
see
whether
there's
some
other
method
of
accomplishing
the
same
result
that
would
not
have
these
anticompetitive
effects.
in
other
words,
you
start
with
the
anticompetitive
effects,
then
they
come
in
and
show
that
this
particular
merger
may
have
certain
significance
in
helping
community
needs.
then
you
look
at
these
community
needs
and
you
say,
“well
now,
do
these
benefits
to
the
community
clearly
outweigh
the
injury
and
maybe
if
this
was
the
--
if
the
problems
were
serious
and
this
was
the
only
way
you
could
solve
the
problems,
and
they
had
attempted
to
solve
them
else
where
you
couldn't
you
have
said
yes,
yes
we
do
think
that
in
this
situation,
the
benefits
to
the
community
do
clearly
outweigh.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice,
we
do
think
that
if
you
have
community
needs
even
though
there
is
community
convenience
and
needs,
if
in
fact,
there
was
no
need
to
resort
a
merger,
to
accomplish
this
community
needs
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i'm
reluctant
to
say
so
because
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
it's
part
of
the
community
need,
mr.
justice.
i
think
it's
involved
in
balancing
the
one
against
the
other
because
the
legislative
history
does
reflect
that
in
community
need
and
convenience,
congress
intended
these
banking
considerations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
says
that
they
clearly
outweigh.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may,
come
to
one
last
thing
about
this
whole
transaction,
which
is
that
the
sale
that
was
made
by
the
weaver
group
to
the
fleming
people
was
made
at
a
substantial
profit.
they
tested
--
mr.
weaver
testified
that
mr.
fleming
sold
them
on
the
idea
that
the
best
way
to
solve
the
problems
of
this
bank
was
by
a
sale
and
mr.
fleming
made
him
a
written
offer
that
as
far
as
the
weaver
group
is
concerned,
whatever
its
ultimate
validity
might
be,
seem
to
him
to
be
a
proposition
on
which
he
couldn't
lose
because
the
written
offer
which
is
plaintiff's
exhibit
478
at
page
951
of
the
record
provided
after
the
exchange
of
stock
that
in
the
event
the
controller
were
to
turn
down
this
merger,
or
in
the
event
that
justice
department
ultimately
prevailed
in
a
lawsuit
attacking
the
merger,
a
firm
named
third
national
company,
there
was
an
affiliate
of
the
third
national
bank
that
handled
its
real
estate
mortgage
business
would
purchase
this
stock
from
the
weaver
group
for
$420
a
share.
so
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
they
had
the
perfect
deal.
they
would
get
their
$420
in
cash
if
the
merger
terminated
otherwise
they
get
the
stock
of
first
national
and
under
these
circumstances
it
seems
just
it's
no
wonder
that
the
weaver
group
at
that
point
didn't
make
any
further
efforts
to
try
to
solve
the
bank's
problems.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
in
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
respond
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
put
to
mr.
henry,
and
also
asked
for
my
comments.
as
i
understand
the
question
is
this,
if
this
court
should
disagree
with
us,
that
there's
a
balancing
equation
involved
and
that
the
basic
determination
is
to
be
made
in
one
step
in
effect,
if
the
court
were
to
so
view
it,
should
this
court
itself
undertake
to
decide
that
issue
or
should
it
rather
remand
it
to
the
district
court
to
make
that
determination
as
an
issue.
as
i
understand
that,
it
is
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan.
and
our
answer
would
be
that
the
case
is
here
and
we
would
agree
that
the
court
of
course,
could
remand
it
to
the
district
court
but
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court,
now
that
the
case
is
here
to
dispose
of
that
issue.
of
course,
as
i
think
i
have
attempted
to
make
clear
that
we
don't
think
this
is
just
one
ball
of
twine
here.
we
think
that
there
are
separate
elements
that
it
would
be
taken
into
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
we
would
urge
this
court
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
case.
we
hope
that
you
would
agree
with
us.
now
i'd
like
to
refer
briefly
to
the
point
that
has
been
made
about
these
classified
loans.
mr.
henry
suggested
that
a
loan
that
is
classified,
it
is
one
that
is
generally
uncollectable
and
somehow
the
fact
that
the
bank
has
a
substantial
significant
amount
of
classified
loans
is
a
very
great
danger
zone.
the
three
different
categories
of
classified
loans.
there's
one
called
substandard,
there's
another
one
called
doubtful
and
as
the
third
one,
that
is
called
loss
and
all
of
substandard
means,
is
that
it
has
more
than
the
normal
risk
involved.
a
substandard
loan
is
not
necessary
alone
that
portends
any
serious
doubt
as
to
its
ultimate
collectibility
and
the
substandard
loans
in
the
portfolio
of
the
first
--
of
the
nashville
bank
were
primarily
--
i'm
sorry,
the
classified
loans
were
primarily
substandard.
it's
nothing
novel
for
a
bank
to
have
classified
loans.
indeed
a
man,
a
witness
named
robson
who
was
the
regional
administrator
of
the
national
bank,
testified
at
page
840
of
the
record
that
third
national
itself
had
quite
a
volume
of
classified
loans
as
did
other
banks.
now,
i'd
next
like
to
turn
to
question
that's
been
repeatedly
urged
upon
here
that
the
government
somehow
is
trying
to
equate
the
convenience
and
needs
test
of
a
failing
company
doctrine.
that's
just
not
so
we
do
not
contend
that
this
is
limited
to
failing
companies.
as
mr.
o'malley
has
pointed
out
under
the
statute
if
a
bank
is
in
serious
difficulties,
the
bank
is
in
serious
difficulties
under
the
statute
itself,
the
controller
may
authorize
a
merger
and
commit
a
merger
to
be
consummated
without
a
waiting
for
the
reports
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
other
banking
agencies.
the
standard
we
have
suggested
for
the
kind
of
situation
which
congress
did
intend,
this
defense
to
be
applicable
is
set
down
at
the
bottom
of
page
8
at
the
top
of
page
9
of
our
reply
brief,
we
said,
congress
intended
principle
concern
of
congress
was
to
permit
mergers
involving
so-called
floundering
banks,
that
is
those
which
although
not
yet
in
failing
condition,
had
sufficiently
serious
problems
to
cause
great
concern
as
to
their
future
unless
the
deficiencies
were
corrected.
now
what
has
to
be
done
in
dealing
with
the
problems
of
a
bank
that
is
in
difficulties?
how
extensive
the
inquiry
has
to
be?
what
the
people
have
to
do
depends
necessarily
on
how
serious
the
problems
are.
there
maybe
situations
where
a
relatively
brief
inquiry
will
make
it
clear
to
the
people
that
there
is
no
solution
to
the
problems.
we
don't
think
that's
this
case
however.
in
this
case
basically,
what
is
shown
by
this
record
is
a
bank
that
admittedly
had
problems,
problems
however
that
flowed
primarily
from
the
management,
the
old
management
in
fact.
mr.
o'malley
says,
this
bank
wasn't
really
competing,
what
mr.
o'malley
means
when
he
suggest
that
this
bank
isn't
competing
is,
he
means
this
bank
was
not
competing
as
vigorously
as
effectively
as
the
banking
authorities
would
like
to
see
a
bank
compete.
the
standard
of
convenience
and
needs
to
the
community,
we
suggest
is
not
what
mr.
o'malley
suggested
whether
the
bank
is
making
the
best
possible
use
of
the
depositor's
money.
that's
not
the
standard.
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
to
start
with
it,
means
something
less
obviously
than
a
failing
bank.
we
concede
that.
we
think
it's
a
bank
which
because
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
something
more
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
something
less
serious
let
me
put
it
that
way.
i
think
what
congress
meant
was
that
a
bank
in
the
search
where
the
situation
was,
that
the
bank's
internal
problems
were
such
that
unless
something
was
done
about
it
to
direct
these
problems
fairly
soon,
it
would
tend
to
go
downhill
and
it
will
ultimately
might
even
turn
into
a
failing
bank.
but
it
seems
to
us
the
mere
fact
that
the
bank
is
not
operating
most
efficiently,
the
mere
fact
that
the
bank
does
not
have
the
most
modern
methods,
the
fact
that
it
may
not
have
a
computer,
that
it
doesn't
have
branches,
that
in
our
view
is
not
enough
to
turn
it
into
a
floundering
bank.
we
don't
think
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will
--
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
and
i'd
like
to
refer
you
to
the
house
committee
report
on
this
bill
which
has
a
section
at
the
top
page
3
of
the
report
about
40%
of
that
page
is
dealing
with
the
floundering
bank
and
that
indicates
that
that
was
–
that
was.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
would
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
discussion?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
i
believe
that's
cited
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
cited.
we
have
not
quoted.
we
have
in
our
brief
stated
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
concern
of
the
congress
was
with
the
floundering
banks.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
that's
we
think
the
purpose
for
legislation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
let
me
say
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
perhaps
i
did
overstated.
and
i
think
it's
the
primary
concern.
i'd
be
reluctant
to
say
that
there
might
be
a
situation
perhaps,
although
i
find
it
difficult
to
conceive
where
something
other
than
a
floundering
bank
would
be
permitted.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
if
i
may
change
a
little
mr.
justice,
i
mean
i
don't
know
that
calling
it
a
floundering
bank
necessarily
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
end
--
it's
the
word
i
use
because
it's
in
the
committee.
but
i
do
suggest
in
the
committee
report,
i
do
suggest
this
that,
when
you
have
anticompetitive
effects
and
the
attempt
is
now
made
to
justify
the
merger,
you
cannot
justify
the
merger
unless
it
appears
that
the
problems
of
this
bank
are
sufficiently
serious
that
unless
something
is
done
by
way
of
merger,
the
bank
is
in
for
a
rough
time
of
it
that
it's
going
to
have
serious
difficulty.
it's
not
it
seems
just
it's
not
enough,
it's
not
enough
under
this
statute
to
say
that
because
the
bank
is
not
the
most
effective
competitor
in
the
community,
that
is
not
enough
to
justify
an
anticompetitive
merger.
and
certainly,
you
cannot
justify
an
anticompetitive
merger
if
there's
some
alternative
methods
for
solving
the
bank's
problems
that
does
not
entail
that
reduction
of
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
would
disagree
with
that
mr.
justice.
if
i
may
suggest
that
the
evidence
there
rely
on
is
in
colloquy
and
debate
in
the
congress
in
which
they
talk
about
the
problem
of
a
little
community
with
two
banks
and
one
of
them
being
absorbed
or
a
community
with
free
banks
and
two
of
them
being
--
but
these
are
all
cases
in
the
hypothetical.
it
seems
to
us
assumed
that
these
are
one
of
the
banks,
the
bank
that's
being
absorbed
is
not
doing
its
job
properly.
it's
in
trouble.
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
this
defense
is
intended
to
sanction
a
merger
where
all
that
you're
saying
is
you
have
some
banks
and
one
bank
in
the
community
isn't
competing
as
vigorously
as
it
might.
it's
not
loaning
out
as
much
of
its
money
to
the
commercial
communities,
got
too
much
of
its
money
tied
up
in
real
estate.
we
don't
think
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
to
which
this
defense
was
intended
to
be
applicable.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
the
floundering
bank?
you
mean
the
language
on
the
floundering
bank?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it's
about
15
lines.
i'd
be
happy
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
says.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it's
quoted.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that
it
includes
the
entire
quotation
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
individual
employees
did
not
have
a
vested
interest
in
the
plan
and
apparently
this
was
considered
a
serious
problem
to
the
bank
and
finally,
this
bank,
unlike
the
larger
banks,
did
not
have
any
automated
equipment
or
even
semi-automated
equipment.
it
did
not
have
a
computer.
despite
these
problems,
the
weaver
and
his
group
decided
to
go
ahead
and
to
buy
controlling
interest
of
the
bank
which
they
did
for
a
price
at
about
$3,780,000.
they
paid
$350
a
share
for
this
stock
and
apparently,
the
price
they
paid
reflected
some
of
the
problems
of
the
bank
because
a
financial
study
that
was
prepared
for
the
bank
at
the
time
of
this
acquisition,
start
to
pay
it
for
mr.
hill,
indicated
that
this
stock
was
being
purchased
at
15
½
times
earnings
whereas,
stocks
of
other
banks
in
the
south
eastern
united
states
were
being
sold
at
18
½
times
earnings.
and
at
the
trial
weaver
explained
that
the
stocks
of
the
banks
that
were
priced
at
a
substantially
higher
earnings
multiple
were
not
comparable
and
the
reason
he
explained
that,
it's
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
502
of
the
record
was
he
said,
speaking
to
mr.
weinbaum,
our
trial
counsel,
these
banks
that
are
being
compared,
mr.
weinbaum,
most
of
them
are
fully
automated.
they
have
funded
pension
plans.
they
have
an
adequate
branching
system.
their
headquarters
and
their
branches
are
modernized,
you
simply
can't
compare
on
that
basis.
now,
mr.
weaver
testified
that
his
group
originally
bought
the
stock
as
an
investment
and
that
that
no
intention
of
selling
the
bank
or
merging
it.
but
he
said
that
after
they
had
looked
into
the
problems
of
the
bank
a
little
more,
they
decided
they
were
even
worst
than
they
had
anticipated.
he
said
they
smoked
to
a
lot
of
people
they
knew
in
the
banking
field
for
advice,
how
to
solve
the
problems
of
this
bank,
but
they
would
tell
that
the
problems
were
very,
very
difficult
and
that
would
be
almost
impossible
they
were
told
to
find
a
replacement
for
mr.
hackworth,
the
president
of
the
bank.
they
also
said
they
discovered
it
would
cost
more
than
they
had
anticipated
to
fund
the
pension
plan,
the
locations
for
branches
were
very
difficult
to
find
and
they
were
very
expensive
and
so
the
result
of
these
discoveries,
they
started
serious
discussion
with
a
mr.
fleming,
the
president
of
third
national
bank
who
made
the
purchase.
at
the
bottom
of
page
515
of
the
record,
mr.
weaver
explained
the
role
mr.
fleming
played
in
persuading
him
to
make
the
sale
and
this
is
what
he
said.
he
said
mr.
fleming
is
a
great
salesman
and
he
sold
beyond
the
idea
and
my
associates
that
the
problems,
the
great
problems
of
this
bank
could
best
be
solved
through
a
merger
with
the
third
national
bank
and
that
the
best
interest
of
a
stockholders,
the
employees,
the
officers,
and
the
national
community
would
be
best
served
through
a
merger.
and
the
same
thought
was
repeated
page
535
when
he
was
asked,
“would
you
say
that
mr.
fleming
more
than
any
other
single
person
illuminated
the
problems
of
the
trust
company
for
you”
and
mr.
weaver
replied,
“yes,
i
would
say
that
he
did.
he
certainly
very
forcefully
brought
to
our
attention
the
problems”
and
then
he
added
of
course,
you
must
remember
that
we
have
already
discovered
many
of
these
problems
when
we
started
our
study
in
depth.
two
months,
after
that
mr.
weaver
group
purchased
the
bank
for
$350
of
share,
it
sold
it
to
the
third
national
in
exchange
for
stock
of
the
third
national
which
then
had
a
value
of
between
$405
or
to
$420
a
share
or
roughly
a
profit
of
between
$600
and
$760,000
on
the
investment
of
three
and
three
quarter
million
dollars.
now
interestingly
enough,
this
was
not
the
first
time
since
he
had
purchased
the
stock
that
mr.
weaver
had
discussed
the
possibility
of
a
merger.
about
two
weeks
after
he
purchased
the
stock,
he
had
the
discussions
with
the
president
of
the
commerce
union
bank
which
was
the
third
largest
bank
in
nashville
that
was
also
interested
in
buying
the
stock.
now
weaver
testified
that
he
was
at
that
point
not
particularly
interested
in
selling
because
he
had
purchased
the
stock
for
investment
that
they
had
discussed
the
possible
exchange
of
commerce
union
and
nashville
bank
stock
and
the
commerce
union
had
offered
them
only
10
shares
for
one
which
was
worth
just
about
$360
a
share
and
he
wasn’t
interested.
the
president
of
commerce
union
on
the
other
hand
testified
that
negotiations
terminated
because
they
couldn’t'
get
together
on
price
that
they
were
talking
about
10
to
one,
and
mr.
weaver
is
talking
about
13
to
one
and
roughly
$100
more.
after
the
approval
of
the
merger
by
the
boards
of
directors
of
the
two
banks,
it
was
submitted
as
the
same
required
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960
to
the
controller
of
the
currency
for
his
approval,
his
approval
was
necessary
before
a
merger
could
be
consummated.
and
as
the
statute
required
the
controller
sought
of
use
of
the
two
other
banking
agencies
and
of
the
department
of
justice.
that
is
the
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
system
and
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company.
all
three
of
these
agencies
advised
the
control
of
that
in
their
view
the
merger
would
have
significant
anticompetitive
consequences.
the
controller
nevertheless
approved
the
merger
and
the
government
within
a
week
filed
a
suit
and
sought
a
preliminary
injunction
to
stay
the
merger,
pending
the
completion
of
the
trial.
after
hearing
the
district
court
denied
the
injunction
on
the
18th
of
august
1964,
the
merger
took
place
the
same
day.
before
the
case
came
to
trial,
however,
the
congress
passed
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
which
in
terms
applied
to
this
case
because
it
was
a
case
that
was
pending
at
that
time
and
under
that
statute
as
it
permits
the
control
of
the
currency
intervened
in
the
district
court
in
opposition
to
the
government's
case
and
he
is
appearing
before
this
court
today,
supporting
the
position
of
the
appellee
banks.
after
a
lengthy
trial,
the
district
court
held
for
the
defendants
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
court
ruled
that
under
the
1966
bank
merger
act,
the
standards
for
determining
the
anticompetitive
effect
of
a
merger,
are
not
those
that
traditionally
have
been
applied
in
section
7
of
merger
cases,
but
rather
that
the
standards
were
those
that
this
court
had
applied
in
1948
in
the
columbia
steel
decision,
a
section
1
case
involving
a
corporate
acquisition.
and
that
case
by
the
way
significantly
we
think
in
this
court's
lexington
bank
decision
about
three
years
ago,
this
court
stated
the
case
was
to
be
confined
to
its
own
special
facts.
the
district
court
also
indicated
that
in
deciding
the
competitive
impact,
it
was
appropriately
considered
not
only
competitive
factors
but
also
the
so-called
banking
factors
which
are
a
matter
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
convenience
and
needs
defense.
and
the
court
concluded
at
pages
7
--
97
and
98
in
its
opinion,
that
he
said
although
the
plaintiff
has
established
an
arguable
case
for
condemnation
of
the
merger
under
the
pre
1966
standards
of
the
lexington
philadelphia
and
other
cases.
treating
davidson
county
is
the
relevant
geographic
market
and
commercial
banking
as
the
services
or
products
market,
the
merger
is
not
violated
of
the
new
antitrust
standards
of
the
1966
amendment.
and
then
as
i've
indicated,
the
court
went
on
and
made
findings
of
its
own
that
at
any
event,
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
this
merger
clearly
will
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
now,
we
think
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
wrong
in
its
view
that
in
the
1966
bank
merger
act,
congress
intended
to
change
the
substantive
standards
for
determining
the
anticompetitive
effect
of
a
bank
merger?
in
its
houston
bank
opinion
last
term,
although
in
a
somewhat
different
context,
this
court
stated
that
congress
intended
that
a
defense
or
justification
be
available.
once
that
it
had
been
determined,
that
a
transaction
would
have
anticompetitive
effects
as
judged
by
the
standards
and
normally
applied
in
antitrust
cases.
the
language
which
congress
used
in
this
section
with
the
one
exception
that
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute
that
it
does
not
contain
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce,
is
identical
to
the
language
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
that
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it
was
mr.
justice.
the
language
is
that
the
effect
of
which
is
effective
in
any
section
of
the
country
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
and
it
seemed
that
when
you're
dealing
with
a
statute
involving
mergers,
like
this
one
is
specialized
type
of
merger,
and
where
congress
has
inserted
a
special
defense,
it
requires
a
very
clear
showing
that
with
congress
use
the
identical
language
in
the
clayton
act,
it
really
intended
a
different
standard.
not
only
is
there
no
such
evidence
in
the
legislative
history,
but
as
we
developed
in
the
reply
brief
we
have
filed,
the
sponsors
of
this
legislation
indicated
that
they
did
intend
the
standards
to
be
applied
in
determining
competitive
effect
to
be
those
traditionally
applied
under
the
sherman
and
clayton
act.
for
example
the
congressman
patman
who
was
responsible
of
the
bill
that
was
finally
enacted
and
whose
statement
is
in
this
court,
“relied
on
heavily
on
the
houston
bank
case
stated
that
the
competitive
standard
to
be
applied
is
clearly
that
of
the
sherman
and
the
clayton
act.
because
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
what
congress
did
in
this
statute
was
to
provide
that
you
determine
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
a
bank
merger
the
same
as
you'd
always
determined
anticompetitive
effects,
but
then
provided
a
limited
exception,
there
were
certain
situations
where
the
anticompetitive
effects
if
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
in
need
of
the
community
to
be
served
would
suffice
to
validate
an
otherwise
anticompetitive
merger.
and
that
is
it
seems
to
me
in
this
all
setting
a
part
of
the
balancing
factor
that
consideration
of
special
factors
applicable
to
banking
play
their
part,
but
only
there.
they
do
not
play
their
part
in
determining
competitive
injury
in
the
sense
that
a
different
standard
is
to
be
used
where
a
determining
competitive
injury
for
banks.
now
the
controller
makes
another
argument.
the
controller
argues
that
because
in
this
statute
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce
do
not
appear
whereas
they
do
appear
in
the
clayton
act,
this
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
in
bank
merger
cases
henceforth
the
relevant
product
line
was
to
be
something
broader
than
commercial
banking
which
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
was
irrelevant
product
market,
it
was
intended
to
encompass
all
financial
institutions
that
is
savings
and
loan
associations,
insurance
companies,
credit
unions,
any
groups
that
make
financing
available
to
the
community.
the
district
court
rejected
these
arguments,
saying
that
he
couldn't
be
assumed
that
congress
would
have
made
such
a
significant
change
by
mere
omission
and
he
also
said
there
was
no
really
significant
legislative
history
to
support
the
contention.
we
fully
agree
with
that.
we
again
have
discussed
in
our
reply
brief
that
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
establishes
that
by
not
using
the
words
in
this
case,
congress
intended
to
change
the
standard
for
determining
the
appropriate
product
market,
a
standard
which
this
court
has
twice
upheld
is
properly
permits
the
treatment
of
commercial
banking
as
the
relevant
line
of
commerce.
in
addition,
the
point
i
previously
made
that
there
is
no
showing
of
any
intend
on
the
part
of
congress
to
change
the
substantive
standards
also
applies
here
because
the
determination
of
the
relevant
product
market
we
think
is
an
integral
element
of
determining
competitive
effect.
now
we
think
that
under
the
proper
standard
for
determining
anticompetitive
effect
that
the
effect
of
this
merger
clearly
was
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
as
i've
indicated,
the
national
banking
market
in
davidson
county
was
highly
concentrated.
three
of
the
banks
had
93%
of
the
market.
the
merger
increased
concentration
to
98%
and
none
of
the
remaining
banks
had
more
than
1%
of
the
market.
now
this
court's
decision
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
recognized
that
a
merger
would
result
within
a
combination
controlling
30%
of
the
market
threatens
undue
concentration.
and
the
court's
opinion
also
pointed
out
that
if
concentration
is
already
great,
the
importance
of
preventing
even
slight
increases
in
concentration
and
so
preserving
the
possibility
or
eventual
decontrol
is
correspondingly
great
and
we
think
that
is
precisely
this
case,
highly
concentrated
a
further
substantial
indicate
increase
in
control.
and
moreover
this
merger
eliminated
the
only
middle-sized
bank
in
the
community.
what
you
have
after
this
merger
is
three
very
large
banks
and
four
very
small
banks.
the
middle-sized
bank,
the
one
that
seem
to
us
is
the
most
powerful
source
of
some
possible
ability
of
deconcentration
has
been
eliminated.
now
the
district
court
found
in
this
case,
and
the
appellee
has
vigorously
argued,
that
national
bank
was
not
a
meaningful
or
substantial
competitor
in
the
national
community.
the
argument
was
that
because
it
wasn't
as
modern,
and
as
efficient,
and
as
effective
as
some
of
the
other
banks,
there
was
not
a
meaningful
competitive.
this
argument,
we
think
rests
on
a
mistaken
notion,
of
kind
of
competition,
section
7
is
designed
to
protect.
and
if
you
have
a
bank
like
this
that
was
have
been
growing,
that
has
a
substantial
share
of
the
market,
we
think
it
is
definitely
a
significant
competitor
whose
elimination
poses
the
kind
of
competitive
threat
that
section
7
was
designed
to
reach
even
though
it
may
not
have
used
the
most
modern
merchandising
methods,
the
most
up
to
date
business
techniques.
admittedly
this
fact
may
not
have
been
the
most
efficient
competitor
in
the
market,
it
didn't
have
any
significant
number
of
branches,
it
was
not
aggressive
--
as
aggressive
as
some
of
the
others
in
competing
from
the
business,
but
nevertheless
we
think
it
was
and
the
record
shows
a
significant
competitor
in
this
market.
the
presidents
of
the
two
other
largest
banks
that
is
other
than
third
national,
who
presumably
are
in
as
good
a
position
as
anyone
to
know
what
kind
of
a
competitive
this
bank
is
testified
that
national
bank
was
a
vigorous
and
effective
competitor.
now
because
of
its
much
smaller
size,
and
national
bank
was
only
perhaps
seven
third,
eight
is
large
as
these
big
banks,
because
of
its
smaller
size,
it
naturally
tended
to
the
medium
size
and
smaller
accounts,
and
to
the
medium-sized
and
smaller
businesses
in
the
community.
the
president
of
the
third
largest
bank,
commerce
union
testified
that
they
had
encountered
nashville
bank
in
soliciting
these
smaller
and
medium-sized
accounts,
and
that
will
indeed
meet
them,
we
found
that
the
competition
was
very
aggressive
and
we
knew
that
they
were
there.
they
said
that
they
have
hackworth
joined
the
bank
in
1956
as
they
said;
they
became
quite
aggressive
in
direct
consumer
loan
business.
the
president
of
the
largest
bank,
first
america,
also
gave
similar
testimony.
he
said
that
in
late
1963
and
1964,
his
chief
rivals
in
nashville
were
the
two
other
large
banks
and
nashville
trust,
that
in
recent
years,
competition
between
his
bank
and
national
trust
for
demand
deposits
was
very
keen,
and
that
national
bank
was
a
major
competitive
therefore
and
he
said
that
in
1963
and
1964
just
before
the
merger,
national
bank
was
that
he
described
it
a
major
competitor
for
the
smaller
industrial
and
commercial
loan.
another
indication
as
to
the
role
national
bank
played
in
this
market
and
as
to
the
competitive
injury
that
resulted
from
its
elimination
was
that
this
bank
provided
its
customers
with
certain
advantages
not
furnished
by
the
other
banks.
for
example,
national
bank
had
lower
service
charges
on
its
checking
accounts
than
did
--
the
other
large
banks.
that's
shown
by
an
exhibit
at
page
1180
of
the
record
in
volume
3,
the
district
court
said
this
was
insignificant
because
it
said
the
amount
of
deposits
to
which
these
lower
service
charges
applied
were
only
4%
of
national
bank's
demand
deposits.
well
that's
true
and
the
reason
that
it's
true
is
because
these
lowered
charges
on
checking
accounts
are
only
significant
on
small
accounts
when
you
have
a
huge
account
with
thousands
of
checks,
they
don't
charge
you
so
much
for
check.
they
work
something
t
it,
is
precisely
in
dealing
with
the
smaller
depositor
who
had
$300
or
$500
in
deposit
that
the
lower
service
charge
on
the
checks
was
significant.
the
record
also
shows
that
there
were
at
least
two
small
businessmen
who
were
able
to
get
loans
from
the
nashville
bank
after
they
had
been
turned
down
by
one
of
the
large
banks.
and
one
of
these
witnesses,
a
man
named
dole,
when
it
was
asked
the
effect
of
a
merger
on
small
borrower
such
as
himself,
explained
very
cautiously
why
he
thought
a
merger
like
this
had
a
bad
effect.
he
said,
i
think
the
page
862,
top
of
the
page,
i
think
the
more
outlets
you
have,
the
more
opportunities
to
seek
or
search
for
a
loan,
the
better
opportunities
you
have
got.
so
to
sum
up
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
we
think
nashville
bank
was
a
significant
factor
in
the
market
and
that
its
elimination
by
a
merger,
which
significantly
increased
concentration
in
the
market,
the
effect
of
this
maybe
substantial
to
lessen
competition
as
this
phrase
has
been
defined
in
the
cases
under
section
7.
now,
we
also
think
that
the
district
court's
error
in
determining
competitive
effect,
necessarily
in
fact
that
its
other
determination
that
any
anticompetitive
effects
were
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
the
statute
permits
an
anticompetitive
merger
to
be
approved
only
if
these
community
benefits
clearly
outweigh,
not
outweighed,
clearly
outweigh
the
anticompetitive
effect
and
we
don't
see
how
that
determination
can
possibly
be
made
in
a
vacuum
without
first
determining
precisely
how
significant
the
anticompetitive
effects
are.
now
the
banks
attempt
to
justify
the
lower
court's
decision
on
the
theory
that
whether
or
not,
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
assessment
of
anticompetitive
consequences
in
any
event
it
was
clearly
correct
in
concluding
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
outweighed,
i
am
sorry,
that
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
outweighed
the
anticompetitive
effect.
but
this
it
seems
to
us,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
statute
under
which
the
all
setting
community
benefits
is
an
alternative
ground
for
upholding
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
this
is
a
different
kind
of
a
statute.
there
is
basically
three
elements
under
this
statute.
first
you
determine
anticompetitive
effects;
if
there
are
no
anticompetitive
effects,
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry,
the
merger
is
permissible.
second
if
you
determine
there
are
anticompetitive
effects,
you
then
ascertain
what
the
effect
of
the
merger
is
and
the
public
and
meaning,
the
public
interest
of
the
community
in
convenience
in
necessity
term.
and
then
after
you
made
that
assessment,
then
you
must
balance
the
two
to
see
whether
the
community
benefits
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest,
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest,
the
anticompetitive
effects
that
have
been
found
and
it
seems
to
us
you
can't
possibly
make
a
reasoned
and
careful
judgment
on
the
later
question
where
it
does
clearly
outweigh
unless
you
have
given
fair
weight
to
the
anticompetitive
effects.
now
we
think
however
that
over
and
beyond
this,
the
district
court's
determination
on
convenience
of
the
needs
of
the
community
as
subject
to
a
further
flow,
the
failure
of
the
district
court
to
recognize
that
the
problems
of
the
nashville
bank
could
be
solved
by
some
step
short
of
an
anticompetitive
merger.
the
banks
argue
that
that
is
not
a
relevant
inquiry
under
this
statute.
they
suggest
that
it's
a
very
simple
inquiry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
did,
mr.
justice.
we
have
again
in
our
reply
brief
set
forth
in
a
footnote
precisely
what
we
said
on
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
district
court
addressed
itself
only
in
one
footnote.
it
didn't
discuss
it
in
its
opinion
because
in
its
opinion,
the
court
did
not
reach
these
things.
the
court
did
make
one
finding
saying
that
because
of
the
age
of
various
of
these
individuals
and
some
other
problems,
it
was
virtually
impossible
that
the
problems
of
the
bank
could
be
solved
by
anything
other
than
a
merger
and
we
of
course,
do
challenge
that
finding.
now
the
banks
argue
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
reach
this
issue
because
they
say,
all
you
have
to
do
is
all
that
statute
says
is,
is
you
look
to
see
the
anticompetitive
effects.
you
look
in
the
all
say
community
benefits,
and
then
you
make
a
determination
whether
the
community
benefits
outweigh
the
anticompetitive
effect
and
if
you
found
that
it
does,
that's
the
end
of
it.
but
of
course,
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
statute
says
that
these
community
benefits
must
clearly
outweigh
in
the
public
interest
the
anticompetitive
effect.
reverting
for
a
moment
again
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
houston
bank
case,
this
court
recognized
that
under
this
statute
antitrust
standards
would
have
been
the
norm
and
anticompetitive
bank
mergers
the
exception
and
we
don't
think
that
in
the
light
of
this
congress
ever
intended
to
permit
a
bank
merger
that
was
anticompetitive
to
be
approved
if
there
was
some
other
way
of
solving
the
bank's
problems,
that
is
another
way
of
accomplishing
the
needs
and
convenience
of
the
community
that
would
not
pose
this
anticompetitive
effects.
so
this
it
seems
does
brings
us
to
the
question
of
whether
the
bank's
problems
were
exceptional,
that
only
a
merger
could
solve
them
and
that
requires
consideration
of
two
things;
first
the
problems,
and
secondly,
the
steps
that
the
weaver
group
he
took
an
attempt
to
solve
them.
everyone
agrees
that
the
primary
problem
of
this
bank
was
management
that
mr.
hackworth
was
getting
old.
there
was
necessary
to
find
a
replacement
for
him
as
well
as
some
others.
mr.
weaver
testified
that
their
solution
to
this
problem
was
they
went
around
and
talked
to
a
number
of
people
they
knew
in
the
banking
business.
they
had
a
lot
of
contacts
and
they
said
they
spoke
to
a
lot
of
people
in
the
banking
business,
and
they
spoke
to
them
at
length,
and
these
people
told
them,
the
problem
was
inside
of
it.
they
did
not
attempt
to
hire
a
management
recruiting
firm
to
see
if
they
could
find
at
president
because
as
he
explained
it,
all
they
relied
primarily,
as
he
described
it,
all
of
the
connections
they
had.
the
government
introduced
as
a
rebuttal
witness,
a
man
named
mills
who
is
from
specialized
in
bank
personnel
recruitment.
he
testified
that
he
had
at
that
time
between
a
150
and
200
existing
bank
presidents
who
were
interested
in
making
a
change.
he
also
had
a
150
to
180
top
executive
officers
who
were
interested
in
making
the
change
that
he
had
placed
over
the
past
five
years,
an
average
of
better
than
five
bank
presidents
and
12
vice
presidents
that
he
had
a
large
number
of
increase
every
year
from
banks
seeking
top
executive
officers.
and
now
these
men
that
were
available,
he
testified
about
20%
where
either
southerners
or
would
be
willing
to
work
in
the
set.
and
at
page
909
of
the
record,
he
made
it
this
very
significant
statement
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
he
said,
“it's
been
my
experience
over
these
30
years
and
10
years
from
the
employer's
side
that
any
bank
which
sincerely
wants
and
needs
executive
management,
and
is
wiling
to
pay
adequate
compensation
for
it,
will
have
no
trouble
in
finding
it.
we
can
supply
bankers
to
any
section
of
the
country.
”
and
then
a
few
lines
down
and
does
the
question
–
and
does
the
opinion
you
have
just
expressed
still
apply
having
considered
the
facts
of
this
case,”
the
answer,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
witness
a
man
named
mr.
mills.
unfortunately
mr.
chief
justice,
we
did
not
cite
his
testimony
in
our
brief.
he
was
a
rebuttal
witness
who
testified,
he
specializes
in
bank
personnel
recruitment.
he
also
of
course,
testified
that
he
had
not
been
approached
to
find
any
officers
for
the
nashville
bank
nor
did
to
any
people
in
the
weaver
group
approached
non-bankers
in
the
community
to
see
whether
they
might
be
interested,
other
business
people,
whether
they
might
be
interested
in
joining
the
bank
although,
the
man
whom
everyone
thinks
was
responsible
for
the
growth
of
the
bank,
mr.
hackworth,
prior
to
joining
the
bank
had
been
the
president
of
the
railroad.
now
we
think
this
is
similar.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
the
other
problems
of
this
bank
was
so
insurmountable
that
only
a
merger
would
solve
them.
concededly
the
bank
had
problems
and
undoubtedly
would
have
cost
some
money
to
solve
it.
they
may
have
to
increase
some
of
the
salaries
that
they
were
paying
and
they
may
have
had
to
reinvest
in
the
business,
some
of
the
substantial
earnings
of
this
bank
although
i
might
mention
in
passing
of
course,
that
to
whatever
extent,
additional
capital
was
reinvested
in
the
bank
and
improvements
presumably,
it
will
be
subsequently
reflected
in
greater
earnings.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that
they're
going
up
mr.
chief
justice
--
this
is
after
taxes,
they've
gone
up
from
$99,000
in
1959
to
$368,000
after
taxes
the
year
before
the
merger.
the
before
tax
earnings
i
think
was
something
like
$480,000
to
$500,000
--
$565,000
in
the
last
year
before
the
merger.
the
net
operating
income
of
the
bank
had
increased
in
every
year
from
1959
to
1963.
the
district
court
and
its
findings,
findings
55
to
64,
pages
118
to
121
of
the
records,
details
in
great
minutia,
the
increase
the
bank
had
enjoyed
in
the
various
indicia
of
banking
operations.
they've
found
that
in
respect
of
many
of
these
functions,
nashville
bank
had
a
greater
rate
of
growth
than
any
other
bank
in
the
country.
and
even
after
1959,
when
the
bank
allegedly
had
reached
the
plateau,
it
was
still
increasing
at
a
significant
rate
although
not
spectacularly
as
before.
for
example,
between
june
1959
and
june
1963,
four
years
before
the
merger,
the
banks
total
assets
and
the
bank's
total
deposits
increased
to
total
of
40%,
roughly
10%
a
year.
and
its
total
loans
in
the
same
period
increased
about
26%
a
year
roughly
6
1/2
%
a
year.
and
we
think
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
stagnant,
this
is
not
a
stagnating
or
floundering
bank.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
institution
that
congress
intended
under
the
bank
merger
act
that
an
anticompetitive
merger
could
be
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
rely
on
two
things,
mr.
justice,
i
would
say.
first,
we
rely
on
the
language,
the
use
of
the
words
clearly
outweigh
in
the
public
interest.
we
think
these
are
broad
phrases
which
do
require
it
and
secondly,
we
rely
on
the
basic
theme
of
the
act.
the
basic
theme
of
the
act
that
anticompetitive
mergers
are
to
be
permitted
only
in
a
limited
exception
where
it's
clearly
outweighed
by
the
community
needs
an
interest,
convenience
and
interest.
and
we
think
that
under
that
kind
of
statute,
that
it
is
not
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
where
there
is
another
method
of
solving
the
bank's
problems
does
not
pose
the
anticompetitive
difference
that
a
merger
does.
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
would
put
it
this
way
if
i
may,
mr.
justice.
we
do
think
that
this
court
should
lay
down
the
rule
that
a
merger
that
has
anticompetitive
effects
cannot
be
justified
if
in
fact
it
appears
from
the
record
that
there
are
alternative
methods
for
solving
its
problems.
now
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice,
the
extent
to
which
they
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
would
think,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
because
the
statute
says
that
the
anticompetitive
merger
is
bad
unless
it
is
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
public.
now,
whenever
people
buy
a
new
business,
they
expect
a
period
of
uncertainties
and
changes.
the
weaver
group
was
well
aware
that
this
bank
had
problems
when
it
ported
in
this.
i've
indicated
the
price
they
paid
apparently
reflected
these
problems.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
--
let
me
put
it
if
i
may
approach
the
question
a
little
differently.
i
think
that
there
are
two
ways
the
problems
of
the
bank
like
this
might
be
solved.
one
way
is
to
make
the
bank
itself
to
make
various
internal
changes.
another
way
would
be
to
sell
the
bank
out
in
a
situation
where
there
was
no
anticompetitive
effect.
that
is
for
example,
the
sale
of
the
bank
by
the
hill
and
hackworth
interest
to
the
weaver
group
on
its
face
had
no
anticompetitive.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
would
think
they
should
be
some
showing
on
the
applied
that
they
at
least
have
attempted,
at
least
have
attempted
to
see
if
there
was
anyone
else
who
was
interested
in
it.
let
me
–
if
i
may
put
the
case
a
little
differently,
if
all
we
show
is
anticompetative
effects
and
there
was
an
offer,
there
was
an
offer
and
immediately
it
was
accepted
an
attractive
offer,
i
doubt,
i
think
that's
enough
for
us
to
prevail.
they
have
to
show
something
more
than
that.
and
in
this
case,
what
we
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
have
to,
mr.
justice,
i
mean
they
have
to
make
reasonable
efforts
to
see
if
there
are
not
some
ways
show
of
a
merger
that
could
solve
this
bank's
problems.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely,
mr.
justice,
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
we
think
this
is
implicit
in
the
standard
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest.
there's
two
phrases;
clearly
outweighed
and
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
statutory
test
is
set
forth
at
page
37
of
our
brief
that
a
proposed
anticompetitive
merger
is
illegal
unless
it
finds
and
that's
either
the
court
or
an
agency
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
proposed
transaction
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
think
the
convenience
and
need
of
the
so-called
banking
factors,
but
we
think
that
even
though
after
you
evaluate
what
the
benefits
to
the
community
are
in
determining
whether
these
benefits
clearly
outweigh
in
the
public
interest,
the
anticompetitive
effect,
you
have
to
look
and
see
whether
there's
some
other
method
of
accomplishing
the
same
result
that
would
not
have
these
anticompetitive
effects.
in
other
words,
you
start
with
the
anticompetitive
effects,
then
they
come
in
and
show
that
this
particular
merger
may
have
certain
significance
in
helping
community
needs.
then
you
look
at
these
community
needs
and
you
say,
“well
now,
do
these
benefits
to
the
community
clearly
outweigh
the
injury
and
maybe
if
this
was
the
--
if
the
problems
were
serious
and
this
was
the
only
way
you
could
solve
the
problems,
and
they
had
attempted
to
solve
them
else
where
you
couldn't
you
have
said
yes,
yes
we
do
think
that
in
this
situation,
the
benefits
to
the
community
do
clearly
outweigh.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice,
we
do
think
that
if
you
have
community
needs
even
though
there
is
community
convenience
and
needs,
if
in
fact,
there
was
no
need
to
resort
a
merger,
to
accomplish
this
community
needs
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i'm
reluctant
to
say
so
because
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
it's
part
of
the
community
need,
mr.
justice.
i
think
it's
involved
in
balancing
the
one
against
the
other
because
the
legislative
history
does
reflect
that
in
community
need
and
convenience,
congress
intended
these
banking
considerations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
says
that
they
clearly
outweigh.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may,
come
to
one
last
thing
about
this
whole
transaction,
which
is
that
the
sale
that
was
made
by
the
weaver
group
to
the
fleming
people
was
made
at
a
substantial
profit.
they
tested
--
mr.
weaver
testified
that
mr.
fleming
sold
them
on
the
idea
that
the
best
way
to
solve
the
problems
of
this
bank
was
by
a
sale
and
mr.
fleming
made
him
a
written
offer
that
as
far
as
the
weaver
group
is
concerned,
whatever
its
ultimate
validity
might
be,
seem
to
him
to
be
a
proposition
on
which
he
couldn't
lose
because
the
written
offer
which
is
plaintiff's
exhibit
478
at
page
951
of
the
record
provided
after
the
exchange
of
stock
that
in
the
event
the
controller
were
to
turn
down
this
merger,
or
in
the
event
that
justice
department
ultimately
prevailed
in
a
lawsuit
attacking
the
merger,
a
firm
named
third
national
company,
there
was
an
affiliate
of
the
third
national
bank
that
handled
its
real
estate
mortgage
business
would
purchase
this
stock
from
the
weaver
group
for
$420
a
share.
so
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
they
had
the
perfect
deal.
they
would
get
their
$420
in
cash
if
the
merger
terminated
otherwise
they
get
the
stock
of
first
national
and
under
these
circumstances
it
seems
just
it's
no
wonder
that
the
weaver
group
at
that
point
didn't
make
any
further
efforts
to
try
to
solve
the
bank's
problems.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
in
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
respond
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
put
to
mr.
henry,
and
also
asked
for
my
comments.
as
i
understand
the
question
is
this,
if
this
court
should
disagree
with
us,
that
there's
a
balancing
equation
involved
and
that
the
basic
determination
is
to
be
made
in
one
step
in
effect,
if
the
court
were
to
so
view
it,
should
this
court
itself
undertake
to
decide
that
issue
or
should
it
rather
remand
it
to
the
district
court
to
make
that
determination
as
an
issue.
as
i
understand
that,
it
is
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan.
and
our
answer
would
be
that
the
case
is
here
and
we
would
agree
that
the
court
of
course,
could
remand
it
to
the
district
court
but
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court,
now
that
the
case
is
here
to
dispose
of
that
issue.
of
course,
as
i
think
i
have
attempted
to
make
clear
that
we
don't
think
this
is
just
one
ball
of
twine
here.
we
think
that
there
are
separate
elements
that
it
would
be
taken
into
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
we
would
urge
this
court
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
case.
we
hope
that
you
would
agree
with
us.
now
i'd
like
to
refer
briefly
to
the
point
that
has
been
made
about
these
classified
loans.
mr.
henry
suggested
that
a
loan
that
is
classified,
it
is
one
that
is
generally
uncollectable
and
somehow
the
fact
that
the
bank
has
a
substantial
significant
amount
of
classified
loans
is
a
very
great
danger
zone.
the
three
different
categories
of
classified
loans.
there's
one
called
substandard,
there's
another
one
called
doubtful
and
as
the
third
one,
that
is
called
loss
and
all
of
substandard
means,
is
that
it
has
more
than
the
normal
risk
involved.
a
substandard
loan
is
not
necessary
alone
that
portends
any
serious
doubt
as
to
its
ultimate
collectibility
and
the
substandard
loans
in
the
portfolio
of
the
first
--
of
the
nashville
bank
were
primarily
--
i'm
sorry,
the
classified
loans
were
primarily
substandard.
it's
nothing
novel
for
a
bank
to
have
classified
loans.
indeed
a
man,
a
witness
named
robson
who
was
the
regional
administrator
of
the
national
bank,
testified
at
page
840
of
the
record
that
third
national
itself
had
quite
a
volume
of
classified
loans
as
did
other
banks.
now,
i'd
next
like
to
turn
to
question
that's
been
repeatedly
urged
upon
here
that
the
government
somehow
is
trying
to
equate
the
convenience
and
needs
test
of
a
failing
company
doctrine.
that's
just
not
so
we
do
not
contend
that
this
is
limited
to
failing
companies.
as
mr.
o'malley
has
pointed
out
under
the
statute
if
a
bank
is
in
serious
difficulties,
the
bank
is
in
serious
difficulties
under
the
statute
itself,
the
controller
may
authorize
a
merger
and
commit
a
merger
to
be
consummated
without
a
waiting
for
the
reports
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
other
banking
agencies.
the
standard
we
have
suggested
for
the
kind
of
situation
which
congress
did
intend,
this
defense
to
be
applicable
is
set
down
at
the
bottom
of
page
8
at
the
top
of
page
9
of
our
reply
brief,
we
said,
congress
intended
principle
concern
of
congress
was
to
permit
mergers
involving
so-called
floundering
banks,
that
is
those
which
although
not
yet
in
failing
condition,
had
sufficiently
serious
problems
to
cause
great
concern
as
to
their
future
unless
the
deficiencies
were
corrected.
now
what
has
to
be
done
in
dealing
with
the
problems
of
a
bank
that
is
in
difficulties?
how
extensive
the
inquiry
has
to
be?
what
the
people
have
to
do
depends
necessarily
on
how
serious
the
problems
are.
there
maybe
situations
where
a
relatively
brief
inquiry
will
make
it
clear
to
the
people
that
there
is
no
solution
to
the
problems.
we
don't
think
that's
this
case
however.
in
this
case
basically,
what
is
shown
by
this
record
is
a
bank
that
admittedly
had
problems,
problems
however
that
flowed
primarily
from
the
management,
the
old
management
in
fact.
mr.
o'malley
says,
this
bank
wasn't
really
competing,
what
mr.
o'malley
means
when
he
suggest
that
this
bank
isn't
competing
is,
he
means
this
bank
was
not
competing
as
vigorously
as
effectively
as
the
banking
authorities
would
like
to
see
a
bank
compete.
the
standard
of
convenience
and
needs
to
the
community,
we
suggest
is
not
what
mr.
o'malley
suggested
whether
the
bank
is
making
the
best
possible
use
of
the
depositor's
money.
that's
not
the
standard.
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
to
start
with
it,
means
something
less
obviously
than
a
failing
bank.
we
concede
that.
we
think
it's
a
bank
which
because
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
something
more
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
something
less
serious
let
me
put
it
that
way.
i
think
what
congress
meant
was
that
a
bank
in
the
search
where
the
situation
was,
that
the
bank's
internal
problems
were
such
that
unless
something
was
done
about
it
to
direct
these
problems
fairly
soon,
it
would
tend
to
go
downhill
and
it
will
ultimately
might
even
turn
into
a
failing
bank.
but
it
seems
to
us
the
mere
fact
that
the
bank
is
not
operating
most
efficiently,
the
mere
fact
that
the
bank
does
not
have
the
most
modern
methods,
the
fact
that
it
may
not
have
a
computer,
that
it
doesn't
have
branches,
that
in
our
view
is
not
enough
to
turn
it
into
a
floundering
bank.
we
don't
think
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will
--
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
and
i'd
like
to
refer
you
to
the
house
committee
report
on
this
bill
which
has
a
section
at
the
top
page
3
of
the
report
about
40%
of
that
page
is
dealing
with
the
floundering
bank
and
that
indicates
that
that
was
–
that
was.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
would
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
discussion?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
i
believe
that's
cited
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
cited.
we
have
not
quoted.
we
have
in
our
brief
stated
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
concern
of
the
congress
was
with
the
floundering
banks.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
that's
we
think
the
purpose
for
legislation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
let
me
say
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
perhaps
i
did
overstated.
and
i
think
it's
the
primary
concern.
i'd
be
reluctant
to
say
that
there
might
be
a
situation
perhaps,
although
i
find
it
difficult
to
conceive
where
something
other
than
a
floundering
bank
would
be
permitted.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
if
i
may
change
a
little
mr.
justice,
i
mean
i
don't
know
that
calling
it
a
floundering
bank
necessarily
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
end
--
it's
the
word
i
use
because
it's
in
the
committee.
but
i
do
suggest
in
the
committee
report,
i
do
suggest
this
that,
when
you
have
anticompetitive
effects
and
the
attempt
is
now
made
to
justify
the
merger,
you
cannot
justify
the
merger
unless
it
appears
that
the
problems
of
this
bank
are
sufficiently
serious
that
unless
something
is
done
by
way
of
merger,
the
bank
is
in
for
a
rough
time
of
it
that
it's
going
to
have
serious
difficulty.
it's
not
it
seems
just
it's
not
enough,
it's
not
enough
under
this
statute
to
say
that
because
the
bank
is
not
the
most
effective
competitor
in
the
community,
that
is
not
enough
to
justify
an
anticompetitive
merger.
and
certainly,
you
cannot
justify
an
anticompetitive
merger
if
there's
some
alternative
methods
for
solving
the
bank's
problems
that
does
not
entail
that
reduction
of
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
would
disagree
with
that
mr.
justice.
if
i
may
suggest
that
the
evidence
there
rely
on
is
in
colloquy
and
debate
in
the
congress
in
which
they
talk
about
the
problem
of
a
little
community
with
two
banks
and
one
of
them
being
absorbed
or
a
community
with
free
banks
and
two
of
them
being
--
but
these
are
all
cases
in
the
hypothetical.
it
seems
to
us
assumed
that
these
are
one
of
the
banks,
the
bank
that's
being
absorbed
is
not
doing
its
job
properly.
it's
in
trouble.
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
this
defense
is
intended
to
sanction
a
merger
where
all
that
you're
saying
is
you
have
some
banks
and
one
bank
in
the
community
isn't
competing
as
vigorously
as
it
might.
it's
not
loaning
out
as
much
of
its
money
to
the
commercial
communities,
got
too
much
of
its
money
tied
up
in
real
estate.
we
don't
think
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
to
which
this
defense
was
intended
to
be
applicable.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
the
floundering
bank?
you
mean
the
language
on
the
floundering
bank?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it's
about
15
lines.
i'd
be
happy
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
says.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it's
quoted.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that
it
includes
the
entire
quotation
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
