justice
abe
fortas
mr.
jenner,
i
suppose
there
is
a
difference
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
between
now
considering
whether
that
was
an
error
to
excuse
a
venire
--
a
prospective
juror
because
he
was
excused
on
the
basis
of
this
statute.
and
there's
difference
between
that
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand,
our
considering
whether
the
illinois
jury
system
is
constitutionally
defective
because
it
includes
this
statute
and
because
in
the
particular
case,
jury
is
--
juror
--
perspective
jurors
were
excused
pursuant
to
the
statute.
in
other
words,
you're
not
asking
us
to
set
aside
the
conviction
here
on
the
grounds
that
some
jurors
were
excluded
for
a
cause.
some
prospective
were
excluded
for
cause
because
of
conscientious
scruples.
you're
asking
us
rather
to
set
aside
the
conviction
because
the
illinois
statutory
scheme
for
the
selection
of
jurors
as
applied
in
this
particular
case
is
a
violation
of
federal
constitution.
and
those
are
different,
are
they
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
know.
have
we
ever
reversed
a
conviction
on
the
grounds
of
improper
disqualification
of
a
prospective
juror?
to
me,
that
presents
some
difficulties
in
terms
of
the
functions
of
this
court,
whereas
consideration
of
the
total
illinois
scheme
for
the
selection
of
jurors
may
fall
with
them
in
an
accepted
known
pattern,
but
i
don't
know
that
--
i
don't
know
that
whereby
this
court
has
ever
reversed
a
conviction
because
of
the
disqualification
of
a
prospective
juror
on
improper
grounds.
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
the
negro
exclusion
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
exactly.
justice
abe
fortas
as
distinguished
from
a
systematic
--
from
a
scheme
of
exclusion
of
a
particular
class.
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
for
me,
mr.
jenner,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
perplexing
problem
may
be
stated
this
way.
the
statute
requires
a
jury
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
they
would
recommend
the
death
penalty,
or
as
to
whether
the
death
penalty
would
be
imposed.
and
juror
statute
--
then
the
statute
says
that
if
a
juror
says
that
he
a
conscientious
or
a
religious
scruple
against
the
death
penalty,
he
will
be
excused
because
the
theory
i
suppose
that
might
be
advanced
in
defense
of
that
is
if
a
person
has
a
religious
or
conscientious
scruple
in
general
against
the
death
penalty,
he
cannot
faithfully
carry
out
his
statutory
duty,
which
is
to
make
a
judgment
in
the
particular
case
as
to
whether
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case
weren't
the
imposition
of
it.
now,
that's
the
perplexing
problem
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
suggesting
that
maybe
some
of
these
jurors,
despite
their
deeply
held
principle,
might
be
able
to
rise
above
the
principle
in
the
particular
case.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
this
statute
said
that
all
quakers
may
be
challenged
for
cause,
would
that
be
--
would
that
run
the
file
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
abe
fortas
don't
know
of
quakers
subscribed
to
--
i
don't
know
if
quakers
have
scruples
against
capital
punishment?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
part
of
their
religion,
their
faith
or
whatever?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
it
were
part
of
their
faith
and
when
this
--
suppose
the
record
showed
that
we're
at
with
your
present
illinois
statute,
that
one
that
is
in
issue
in
this
case,
and
suppose
the
record
showed
that
all
quakers
were
people
who
had
religious
scruples
against
capital
punishment,
doesn't
that
get
you
in
to
one
of
these
misleading
syllogistic
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
results
which
would
throw
your
case
for
a
loss?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
said
--
you
say
all
persons
--
all
persons
who
have
religious
scruples,
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment.
all
quakers
in
my
assumption
have
religious
scruples
against
capital
punishment
therefore,
etcetera.
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
the
claim
is
that
the
general
statutory
scheme
here
is
such
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
select
a
jury
from
the
citizenry
of
the
community
on
the
basis
of
the
individual
qualification
or
lack
of
qualification
for
the
purposes
of
this
particular
case,
and
what
you
have
done
here
is
to
set
forth
an
arbitrary
that
is
to
say
a
definitional
exclusion
in
terms
of
the
definition
of
a
class.
and
that
--
that's
point
one
in
the
argument
as
i
see
it.
the
point
two
in
the
argument
would
have
to
be
i
suppose
that
the
exclusion
of
this
particular
class
is
a
relevant
material
on
the
question
of
fair
trial
and
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
a
jury
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that's
an
issue
between
--
if
i
understand
it,
that's
the
issue
between
you
and
your
adversary
that
is
mr.
jenner
who
says
that
the
statute
is
not
a
statute
disqualifying
persons
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
discharge
their
function
properly
in
this
particular
case
but
that
the
statute
is
a
disqualification
in
terms
of
a
general
philosophical
scruple.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
once
you
--
a
person
says,
“i
have
a
conscientious
scruple
against
something,”
that
means
that
--
that
that
--
yeah,
that
that
also
covers
the
particular
inquiry.
that
that
would
mean
that
he
has
a
conscientious
scruple
which
would
not
enable
him
to
--
not
permit
him
to
bring
in
a
death
penalty
in
a
particular
case.
