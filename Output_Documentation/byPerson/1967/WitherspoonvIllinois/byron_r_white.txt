justice

white
not
a
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
some
cases
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did
come
up
in
this
recent
fourth
circuit
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
--
i
thought
you
were
with
--
have
argued
or
will
argue
that
this
practice
in
illinois
will
--
does
have
this
consequence.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
never
had
--
they
never
actually
had
their
subjects
arrange
this
juror
--
these
jurors
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
the
group.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
coming
out
with
the
--
with
the
verdict.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
any
of
these
assigners
testified
at
the
trial
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
seem
to
be
relying
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
seem
to
be
relying
on
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
gather
your
argument
was
therefore
would
certainly
cover
the
--
all
of
the
cases
even
where
the
death
penalty
was
not
imposed.
i
mean,
it
would
have
to
reach
those
because
in
those
cases,
if
the
death
penalty
could
have
been
imposed
and
the
jury
was
death
qualified
scruple
people
who
admitted
why
even
the
death
penalty
isn't
imposed
--
wasn't
imposed,
do
they
--
a
fair
segment
of
the
community
has
been
excluded
from
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
say
that
--
if
you
say
that
it
only
affected
the
imposition
of
the
penalty
that
was
your
basics,
but
does
that
would
be
important
to
your
argument
here.
you're
purporting
argument
has
been
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
have
representation
of
all
segments
of
the
community
in
determining
his
guilt
or
innocence,
and
that
disqualification
of
jurors
excludes
a
segment
of
the
community
from
the
jury,
which
makes
it
an
unfair
jury.
that's
been
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
don't
see
how
you
can
help
but
apply
it
to
the
case
where
--
where
the
death
penalty
has
not
been
imposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
thought
you
concede
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
under
a
case
where
when
you're
picking
the
jury,
the
possibility
is
that
the
death
penalty
might
be
imposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
disqualify
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
any
concern
--
you
say
--
you
started
out
your
argument
by
saying
that
the
case
law
--
the
case
law
in
the
illinois
didn't
say
that
all
he
had
to
have
was
conscientious
scruples,
that
the
case
law
was
the
standard,
was
that
he
would
not
hold
--
he
would
not
impose
the
death
penalty
in
these
circumstances
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
either
some
cases
which
define
what
kind
of
a
conscientious
objection
he
must
have
in
order
to
be
excused
for
good?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what's
the
--
have
the
illinois
cases
defined
what
the
challenge
for
cause
is
in
this
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
say
in
this
case?
what
did
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
standard
did
the
trial
judge
think
he
was
applying
in
excusing
47?
i
think
that
you're
suggesting
that
because
he
questioned
the
six
in
this
manner
and
only
excused
them
after
they
said
in
under
no
circumstances
that
he
--
that
was
the
standard
he
was
applying
across
the
board
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
the
standard
problem
applied
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
some
cases
on
that?
justice

it
