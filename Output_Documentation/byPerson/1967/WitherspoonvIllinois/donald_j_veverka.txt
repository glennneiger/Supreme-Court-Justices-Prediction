mr.
donald
j.
veverka
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
people,
i
will
take
22-and-a-half
minutes.
in
the
weight
of
my
rather
limited
time,
i
would
address
myself
to
the
questions
asked
as
opposed
to
going
through
the
said
argument.
now,
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
illinois
law
as
it
exists
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
not
a
direct
holding
in
the
hatz
(ph)
case,
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
if
the
jurors
states
that
“i
am
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty”
that
under
illinois
law,
that
person
should
be
disqualified
for
cause.
in
regard
to
mr.
jenner's
argument
that
the
statute
allowed
a
person
to
be
excused
for
cause
in
the
basis
of
mere
opposition,
again,
i
would
say
that
there
has
never
been
a
case
law
in
illinois.
there
is
no
reported
case
in
illinois
which
says
that
a
person
can
be
excused
really
because
he
is
opposed.
i
don't
think
that
the
practices
employed
in
this
record
shows
that
anyone
was
excused
for
mere
opposition
alone.
in
that
respect,
i
would
point
out
that
when
the
first
juror,
first
prospective
juror
was
examined,
the
question
was
asked,
“do
you
have
any
conscientious
or
religious
scruples
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
a
proper
case?”
and
he
said,
“i
don't
understand
the
question.”
so
the
court
and
the
assistant
states
attorney,
mr.
kissane,
then
went
on
and
they
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
submit
evidence.
you,
you'll
be
instructed
the
rules
of
law.
if
it
is
your
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
other
individuals,
would
you
return
a
death
verdict?”
and
he
said
no.
and
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
something
about
“under
no
circumstances
would
you
oppose
a
death
penalty?”
and
again,
the
juror
said
no.
and
the
court
then
said,
“well,
what
you
mean
is
you
have
conscientious
religious
scruples
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.”
and
he
said,
“yes,
sir.”
now,
it's
true
that
the
trial
court
did
not
go
through
that,
go
through
each
of
the
perspective
jurors
with
that
particular
particularity.
but
periodically
throughout
the
course
of
the
examination
in
regard
with
the
six
prospective
jurors,
either
the
ones
who
were
excused,
he
did
question
them
specifically
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
impose
a
death
penalty.
in
each
one
of
these
six
cases,
the
juror
made
it
clear
that
under
no
circumstance
would
he
in
fact
impose
a
death
penalty.
at
one
point,
one
of
the
jurors
said,
“i
have
conscientious
religious
scruples
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty”
and
yet,
the
judge
persisted
in
his
questioning
when
it
turned
out
that
it
was
a
matter
of
a
conscience
where
she
said
that
she
was
really
reluctant
to
serve
on
the
jury.
the
judge
in
fact
tendered
her
to
the
attorneys
for
examination.
and
there
was
only
--
after
she
stated
the
--
she
didn't
feel
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
right,
your
honor.
and
basically,
it's
his
contention
that
it's
a
systematic
exclusion.
it's
our
contention
that
this
--
it's
our
contention
that
when
the
prospective
juror
states,
“i
have
a
conscientious
religious
scruple
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
a
proper
case,”
that
indicates
and
it
already
has
indicated
under
illinois
law
and
under
federal
law
and
under
most
--
under
the
law
of
most
other
jurisdictions
that
when
he
states
that,
he
indicates
a
belief
which
will
interfere
with
his
returning
of
verdict
and
the
law
and
the
evidence
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
in
the
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i
would
say
this.
in
the
context
of
the
questioning
where
periodically
the
jurors
were
questioned
and
the
other
jurors
were
instructed
to
listen,
i
think
that
the
trial
court
made
it
clear
that
in
fact,
he
was
concerned
with
people
who
would
not
impose
a
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances.
now
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that's
true.
but
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
if
this
prospective
juror
states
that
“i
would
not
return
to
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances”,
that
that
clearly
shows
and
actual
bias.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
when
he
says
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
when
he
says,
“i
would
not
impose
a
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances,”
that
indicates
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
right.
okay,
in
regard
to
the
other
prospective
jurors
who
did
not
--
were
not
examined
with
this
degree
of
particularity,
i'd
say
that
he
has
indicated
to
the
court
that
there
might
be
a
disposition
to
lean
for
the
defense.
now,
lacking
any
further
questioning,
and
there
was
in
one
--
at
one
point
the
defense
counsel
said,
“let
state
inquire”
even
after
he
had
moved
--
even
after
the
prosecutor
had
moved
to
excuse
the
juror,
the
defense
counsel
said
“let
state
proceed”
and
then
there
was
further
questioning.
i
say
simply
that
when
a
juror
indicates
this,
lacking
any
indication
or
any
objection
on
the
part
of
the
defense
counsel
that
that
juror
has
indicated
that
he
has
some
predisposition
in
the
case
and
that
the
excusing
of
those
jurors
on
that
basis
is
not
unreasonable.
now
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
yes,
justice
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no
juror
can
sit
down
on
a
capital
case
with
who
has
conscientious
scruples
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty?
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that's
--
that's
close
to
it.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
say
that
--
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
it
would
--
that
it
might
very
well
be,
but
i
don't
think
that
we
have
that
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
the
case
law
in
illinois
--
there
were
no
case
in
illinois
has
ever
held
that
mere
opposition
in
and
of
itself,
aside
from
the
question
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
your
honor.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
logan
case
which
was
an
1892
year
--
a
case
decided
in
1892
by
this
court,
that
was
exactly
the
question
that
was
asked,
“have
you
any
conscientious
scruples
in
regard
to
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
for
crime?”
and
14
jurors,
prospective
jurors
were
excused
there.
and
this
court
held
that
a
prospective
juror
who
had
conscientious
scruples
on
any
subject
had
indicated
that
he
could
not
be
impartial.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
specifically
defining
what
is
a
conscientious
scruple?
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
in
the
hobbs
case,
they
cited
part
and
a
couple
of
the
other
federal
cases
with
approval,
and
i
think
that
in
those
cases,
it's
clear
that
when
you
talk
about
a
conscientious
or
religious
scruple,
you're
talking
about
more
than
just
a
mere
opposition.
you're
talking
about
a
--
an
opinion.
it
would
seriously
interfere
with
the
juror's
ability
to
render
a
fair
verdict.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
--
in
regard
to
this,
it
said
merely
that
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
act
in
excusing
these
individuals.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecutor
felt
that
by
answering
yes
to
that
question,
the
juror
was
indicating
that
he
was
so
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
that
the
probability
was
great
that
he
would
not
impose
it
under
any
circumstances.
i
would
also
point
out
in
that
respect
that
on
two
other
occasions,
the
defense
counsel
was
the
one
who
benefited.
there
was
one
gentleman
whose
brother's
son-in-law
was
a
policeman
and
he
was
asked
if
he
could
be
fair
and
impartial.
he
said
he
thought
he
could.
and
the,
defense
counsel
said,
“are
you
absolutely
positive?”
and
he
said,
“possibly,
it
might
affect
me”
and
the
trial
court
granted
the
defense's
motion
to
excuse
for
cause.
there
was
another
woman
whose
husband
was
a
policeman
and
in
that
case,
she
said
--
she
was
asked,
“do
you
have
any
leanings
one
way
or
the
other?”
and
the
defense
moved
to
excuse
the
woman
and
the
trial
court
granted
the
defense's
motion
to
excuse
that
woman.
and
what
he
said
was,
“i'm
going
to
grant
the
excuse
for
cause.
you
might
have
some
leanings
one
way
or
the
other.”
what
we're
saying
simply
is
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
the
juror
states
that
he
could
be
fair
and
impartial
on
the
facts
of
that
particular
case,
i
think
that
there's
a
big
chance
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
stop
the
juror.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no.
no,
your
honor.
but
our
contention
is
simply
this,
that
when
the
juror
asked
--
answered
affirmatively
to
that
question,
he
was
indicating
sufficient
intensity
of
bias
in
the
case
to
be
excused
and
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
excuse
him
under
those
circumstances.
the
trial
court
on
numerous
occasions
indicated
that
what
he
was
trying
to
do
is
get
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
with
no
leanings
one
way
or
the
other
way.
he
excused
not
only
these
individuals
but
also
a
couple
of
individuals
on
the
defense's
motion
simply
because
it
was
attempting
to
get
a
jury
which
had
no
predisposition.
and
again,
we
think
that
when
a
jury
answers
affirmatively
to
that
question
that
he
in
fact
has
indicated
that
he
cannot
be
absolute
fair
--
absolutely
fair
and
impartial
to
both
sides
and
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
excuse
them.
i
think
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
not
less
than
14
years.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
there
was
a
statute
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
mr.
witherspoon
was
tried.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
because
i
think
we'd
go
much
broader
than
that
the
entire
theory
of
american
justice
has
always
been
that
if
a
person
indicates
that
he
cannot
be
fair
and
impartial
that
you
excuse
him.
if
a
prospective
juror
in
illinois
states
that
he
thinks
a
policeman
would
be
a
more
credible
witness
than
say
another
individual
that
he
indicates
that
he
doesn't
believe
in
insanity
defense,
he's
excused.
now,
we
think
that
if
a
person
indicates
a
bias
in
some
way
that
he
should
be
excused.
we
think
that
if
a
person
says
that
he
would
not
return
the
death
penalty
verdict
under
any
circumstances
that
this
is
not
a
fair
and
impartial
juror.
we
feel
that
the
question
is
carried
over
sufficiently
enough
and
that
the
very
definition
of
a
conscientious
scruple
has
always
been
in
illinois
and
in
other
jurisdictions
that
this
indicates
an
opinion
of
sufficient
intensity
so
that
it
interfere
with
the
person's
ability
to
weigh
the
possibilities
and
to
reach
at
a
decision.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
i
would
--
again,
there
were
six
that
i
don't
think
that
we
would
quarrel
with
at
all.
i
think
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
okay.
i
think
going
beyond
that,
i
think
that
we
can
--
i
think
that
there
were
certainly
another
group
of
individuals
who
have
heard
this
question
and
it
was
clear
to
them
that
this
is
exactly
what
--
what
the
judge
was
concerned
with,
a
person
who
would
not
under
any
circumstances
impose
a
death
penalty.
now,
again,
i
think
that
even
if
in
fact
a
--
if
a
juror
says,
“i
have
a
conscientious
religious
scruple,”
even
if
he
does
not
fully
understand
--
he
does
not
fully
understand
that
this
means
that
--
it
should
mean
that
he
will
not
under
any
circumstances
impose
the
death
penalty.
we
say
simply
that
it
is
yet
not
unreasonable
and
that
if
in
fact
some
of
those
jurors
were
excused
for
cause
or
perhaps
shouldn't
have
been
that
it
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation.
and
i
think
that
it
ties
in
with
the
point
that
justice
fortas
made
that
it
might
very
well
be
two,
we
remember
that
the
trial
took
place
in
1960.
i
think
the
trial
court's
clearly
indicated
that
he
was
trying
to
come
up
with
12
individuals
who
had
not
feelings
one
way
or
the
other
way,
and
i
think
that's
clearly
did
it
for
both
the
prosecution
and
the
defense.
and
going
in,
they
are
the
two
basic
points,
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
systematic
exclusion
which
is
unreasonable,
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
said
that
a
systematic
exclusion
is
unconstitutional,
that
it
is
always
in
its
opinions,
if
not
explicitly,
implicitly
made
it
clear
that
the
mere
exclusion
of
a
group
of
individuals
is
not
unconstitutional
per
se.
at
every
state,
and
i
think
this
is
directly
involved
in
this
case,
every
state
has
numerous
exemptions.
now,
i
think
that
perhaps
a
fireman
or
a
minister
or
something
like
that,
one
individual
minister
or
one
individual
fireman
or
the
like
might
not
necessarily
be
of
such
--
be
of
such
import
that
perhaps
the
public
good
would
be
hiring
the
fewer
to
be
called
for
jury
duty.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
classification
and
determine
whether
or
not
it's
reasonable.
when
you
have
an
exclusion
of
individuals
that
is
reasonable
on
its
face,
i
think
that
if
in
fact
one
or
two
or
a
small
number
of
those
individuals
are
not
in
fact
--
if
perhaps
the
exclusion
of
a
few
of
these
individuals
is
not
warranted,
i
think
nevertheless,
we
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation.
the
cross-section
of
the
community
concept,
which
mr.
jenner
discusses
has
never
had
any
independent
constitutional
right.
it's
always
been
tied
in
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
an
arbitrary
systematic
exclusion.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
it
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
understand
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
understand,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
the
classification
of
quakers
in
and
of
themselves
i
think
very
well
they
might
be
unconstitutional.
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
we've
said
here.
i
think
what
we
said
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
well,
i
think
that's
the
unreasonable
step
though,
assuming
that
all
quakers
do
in
fact
have
conscientious
religious
scruples.
i
would
simply
point
out
that
setting
up
this
criteria
of
those
having
conscientious
religious
scruples,
we
were
in
fact
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
logan
case
where
they
said
that
a
person
who
has
conscientious
religious
scruples
cannot
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror.
now,
i
would
indi
--
i
would
admit
that
if
in
fact
defense
counsel
had
made
any
attempt
at
any
point
and
said,
“we
object
to
the
execution
--
exclusion
of
that
individual,”
he
might
nevertheless
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror.
i
admit
that
if
he
had
made
an
attempt
to
show
bias
questioning
that
in
fact
any
one
of
those
jurors
could
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror
and
if
he
was
either
not
permitted
to
do
so
or
if
in
fact
he
was
able
to
show
that
these
persons
who
were
excluded
could
in
fact
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror,
then
i
think
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
but
the
definition
is
it
was
set
up
and
was
defined
by
the
law
was
in
effect
that
of
those
individuals
who
could
not
be
fair
and
impartial.
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
any
objection
or
any
argument
made
that
the
statute
said
that
all
jurors
who
could
not
be
fair
and
impartial
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
but
that
--
it
completely
ignores
the
word
scruple
as
it
has
been
defined
for
a
hundred
years,
including
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
we
say
that
an
affirmative
answer
--
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
when
a
person
answers
affirmatively
to
that
question
that
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
set
up
and
if
lacking
any
additional
question
that
that
is
not
an
unreasonable
action
taken
by
the
trial
court.
and
that
if
on
a
few
occasions,
if
a
person's
views
were
not
absolutely
strong
enough
to
exclude
or
which
would
provide
sufficient
grounds
for
excluding
that
person
that
that
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
would
point
out
that
five
of
the
12
jurors
who
were
actually
tendered
were
tendered
by
the
defense
and
not
by
the
prosecution.
so
what
that
indicates
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
was
--
that
was
not
the
practice
followed
in
all
of
them.
initially,
three
out
of
the
first
12
jurors
were
interrogated
at
some
length.
it
wasn't
as
perfunctory
as
the
defense
counsel
would
make
this
court
believe.
there
was
extended
questioning
of
three
of
the
first
11
jurors.
after
that,
it
might
have
been
perhaps
a
little
more
perfunctory,
but
again,
i
would
point
out
that
five
of
the
12
jurors
that
were
tendered
were
tendered
by
the
defense,
which
means
that
they
had
the
opportunity
to
examine
this
panel.
they
found
those
five
jurors
satisfactory
and
they
tendered
them
to
the
prosecution.
so
these
were
the
ones
who
were
examined
by
them.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--t
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
at
one
point
where
the
prosecution
moved
to
exclude
a
juror
for
cause
and
the
grounds
--
on
the
grounds
of
conscientious
religious
scruples,
what
occurred
was
that
the
judge
asked,
“do
you
have
any
conscientious
religious
scruples
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
a
proper
case?”
the
juror
said
yes
and
the
prosecution
said
excused
for
cause.
the
defense
counsel
said
let
the
state
inquire.
i
think
the
prosecution
was
inquiring
and
there
was
further
questioning.
so
there
certainly
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
defense
counsel
from
asking
questions
or
from
asking
--
objecting,
asking
the
prosecution
to
further
clarify
it.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
they
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
on
occasion,
in
fact
it
was
explored
and
we
have
--
we
have
an
additional
problem
here
i
think
that
at
least
in
one
case
in
illinois
and
another
case
from
some
other
jurisdiction,
which
i
read,
the
claim
was
raised
that
in
fact,
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
by
the
fact
that
there
have
been
extended
questioning
of
the
prospective
jurors
on
the
question
of
their
views
as
to
the
death
penalty.
the
claim
was
that
the
trial
was
slanted
in
this
way
and
that
death
penalty
was
unduly
prejudiced.
again,
we
would
simply
say
that
after
the
extended
questioning
of
the
first
few
jurors
where
they
indicated
that
under
no
circumstances
would
they
impose
a
death
penalty
that
perhaps
on
occasion
that
although
the
questioning
was
not
sufficient,
lacking
any
request
for
--
any
request
for
clarification
or
the
like
that
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
action
which
was
taken.
i
think
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
we
think
it's
not
only
that,
your
honor.
your
honor
phrased
it
very
succinctly.
i
think
it's
not
only
that.
i
think
it's
broader
than
that.
i
think
it
goes
as
to
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
have
any
particular
provision
nullified
by
having
jurors
on
the
panel
who
have
a
fixed
bias
in
some
way.
we
feel
that
the
results,
if
the
contentions
are
accepted,
i
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
serious
reappraisal
over
unanimous
verdicts.
we
think
that
the
only
alternative
to
this
argument
is
a
complete
system
of
bifurcated
trials
with
two
juries,
one
sitting
on
the
question
of
guilt
and
one
sitting
on
the
question
of
punishment.
we
think
that
there
is
no
alternative
in
capital
cases
if
in
fact
the
petitioner's
contentions
are
accepted.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
very
--
that
is
the
effect
of
it,
your
honor.
that
is.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
in
so
far
as
those
--
i
believe
there
are
two
jurors
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
understand
your
question
and
i
would
reply
this.
i
would
say
that
it's
--
we
think
clearly
reasonable
to
excuse
a
juror
who
has
an
actual
bias.
now,
we
think
that
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
also
the
instances
of
implied
bias.
for
example,
in
the
erwin
case
decided
by
this
court
where
the
court
said
in
effect
even
though
the
jurors
said
they
could
be
fair
and
impartial,
in
fact
since
they
read
the
newspaper
accounts
and
the
like,
we
think
that
the
possibility
of
their
being
biased
and
therefore,
we're
going
to
reverse
the
conviction.
now,
we
would
say
that
whether
or
not
a
person's
views
are
strong
enough
to
justify
his
excuse
has
always
been
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
trial
court.
we
say
that
it's
not
entirely
unreasonable
for
a
trial
court
to
examine
a
jury
and
if
he
says,
“i
am
opposed
to
the
death
penalty”
if
absent
other
features,
we
do
not
think
that
this
is
entirely
unreasonable.
but
again,
i
would
point
out
that
in
this
case,
we
had
two
jurors
which
might
be
interpreted
that
way
and
to
the
best
of
my
analogy,
there's
never
been
a
practice
in
illinois,
no
case
has
ever
said
that
mere
opposition
is
sufficient.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
now
the
statute
merely
provides
for
cause.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
understand
it's
being
argued
by
amicus
rather.
in
the
answer
to
your
question,
i
would
say
that
if
the
statute
said
that
mere
opposition
is
sufficient,
i
think
i
would
have
to
concede
that
that
would
probably
be
unconstitutional.
if
in
any
one
individual
case
the
question
came
up
where
one
or
two
jurors
or
perhaps
five
jurors
said
“i
am
opposed
to
the
death
penalty”
and
if
there
was
nothing
other
than
that,
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
but
i
agree
with
you
that
if
the
statute
read
that
way
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
--
it
might
be
a
violation
of
state
law,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
we're
excused
from
mere
opposition
of
the
death
penalty?
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
record
in
this
case
and
i
--
the
law
has
always
been
that
the
conscientious
scruple
differ
immensely
from
mere
opposition.
that
is
always
--
that's
been
the
federal
law
and
from
my
reading
of
the
illinois
law,
that
is
the
illinois
law,
that
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
two.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
again,
there
were
again
two
instances
where
--
i
don't
want
to
avoid
your
question.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
--
i'd
say
that
the
excusing
of
two
jurors
under
this
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
per
se.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i'd
say,
your
honor,
that
it
would
have
to
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
i
think
a
much
greater
number
of
jurors
would
have
to
be
excused
than
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
would
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
would
point
out,
your
honor,
that
that
has
occurred
in
some
of
the
cases,
i
believe
puff
and
the
boyd
cases.
that's
exactly
what
happened
where
a
juror
said,
“i
believe
that
someone
who
is
convicted
of
this
crime
should
be
punished
with
a
death
penalty.”
i
--
in
the
recent
speck
case
where
eight
nurses
were
murdered,
one
juror
said,
“i
would
consider
only
the
first
and
third
verdicts”
and
meaning
that
he
would
consider
only
death
and
he
was
excused
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
quarrel
area
but
i
don't
think
that's
unreasonable.
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
couldn't
know
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
which
method,
your
honor?
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
there
are
44
jurisdictions
presently
which
have
same
or
similar
statutes
which
provide
that
a
juror
can
be
excused
for
conscientious
scruples.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
there
are
presently
41
jurisdictions.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
they're
set
forth
in
the
appendix,
i
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
many
of
them
do
say
that,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
well,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
not
specifically
a
statutory
thing.
this
is
a
common
law
thing.
long
before
the
statutes
were
passed,
the
courts
have
been
holding
back.
the
first
case
in
illinois
was
in
1852.
and
that
long
prior
to
the
time
that
many
of
these
statutes
were
passed,
the
courts
of
the
various
jurisdictions
had
been
holding
that
such
is
the
case.
i'm
cutting
in
to
the
states
attorney's
time,
i
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
people,
i
will
take
22-and-a-half
minutes.
in
the
weight
of
my
rather
limited
time,
i
would
address
myself
to
the
questions
asked
as
opposed
to
going
through
the
said
argument.
now,
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
illinois
law
as
it
exists
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
not
a
direct
holding
in
the
hatz
(ph)
case,
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
if
the
jurors
states
that
“i
am
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty”
that
under
illinois
law,
that
person
should
be
disqualified
for
cause.
in
regard
to
mr.
jenner's
argument
that
the
statute
allowed
a
person
to
be
excused
for
cause
in
the
basis
of
mere
opposition,
again,
i
would
say
that
there
has
never
been
a
case
law
in
illinois.
there
is
no
reported
case
in
illinois
which
says
that
a
person
can
be
excused
really
because
he
is
opposed.
i
don't
think
that
the
practices
employed
in
this
record
shows
that
anyone
was
excused
for
mere
opposition
alone.
in
that
respect,
i
would
point
out
that
when
the
first
juror,
first
prospective
juror
was
examined,
the
question
was
asked,
“do
you
have
any
conscientious
or
religious
scruples
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
a
proper
case?”
and
he
said,
“i
don't
understand
the
question.”
so
the
court
and
the
assistant
states
attorney,
mr.
kissane,
then
went
on
and
they
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
submit
evidence.
you,
you'll
be
instructed
the
rules
of
law.
if
it
is
your
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
other
individuals,
would
you
return
a
death
verdict?”
and
he
said
no.
and
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
something
about
“under
no
circumstances
would
you
oppose
a
death
penalty?”
and
again,
the
juror
said
no.
and
the
court
then
said,
“well,
what
you
mean
is
you
have
conscientious
religious
scruples
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.”
and
he
said,
“yes,
sir.”
now,
it's
true
that
the
trial
court
did
not
go
through
that,
go
through
each
of
the
perspective
jurors
with
that
particular
particularity.
but
periodically
throughout
the
course
of
the
examination
in
regard
with
the
six
prospective
jurors,
either
the
ones
who
were
excused,
he
did
question
them
specifically
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
impose
a
death
penalty.
in
each
one
of
these
six
cases,
the
juror
made
it
clear
that
under
no
circumstance
would
he
in
fact
impose
a
death
penalty.
at
one
point,
one
of
the
jurors
said,
“i
have
conscientious
religious
scruples
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty”
and
yet,
the
judge
persisted
in
his
questioning
when
it
turned
out
that
it
was
a
matter
of
a
conscience
where
she
said
that
she
was
really
reluctant
to
serve
on
the
jury.
the
judge
in
fact
tendered
her
to
the
attorneys
for
examination.
and
there
was
only
--
after
she
stated
the
--
she
didn't
feel
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
right,
your
honor.
and
basically,
it's
his
contention
that
it's
a
systematic
exclusion.
it's
our
contention
that
this
--
it's
our
contention
that
when
the
prospective
juror
states,
“i
have
a
conscientious
religious
scruple
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
a
proper
case,”
that
indicates
and
it
already
has
indicated
under
illinois
law
and
under
federal
law
and
under
most
--
under
the
law
of
most
other
jurisdictions
that
when
he
states
that,
he
indicates
a
belief
which
will
interfere
with
his
returning
of
verdict
and
the
law
and
the
evidence
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
in
the
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i
would
say
this.
in
the
context
of
the
questioning
where
periodically
the
jurors
were
questioned
and
the
other
jurors
were
instructed
to
listen,
i
think
that
the
trial
court
made
it
clear
that
in
fact,
he
was
concerned
with
people
who
would
not
impose
a
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances.
now
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that's
true.
but
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
if
this
prospective
juror
states
that
“i
would
not
return
to
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances”,
that
that
clearly
shows
and
actual
bias.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
when
he
says
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
when
he
says,
“i
would
not
impose
a
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances,”
that
indicates
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
right.
okay,
in
regard
to
the
other
prospective
jurors
who
did
not
--
were
not
examined
with
this
degree
of
particularity,
i'd
say
that
he
has
indicated
to
the
court
that
there
might
be
a
disposition
to
lean
for
the
defense.
now,
lacking
any
further
questioning,
and
there
was
in
one
--
at
one
point
the
defense
counsel
said,
“let
state
inquire”
even
after
he
had
moved
--
even
after
the
prosecutor
had
moved
to
excuse
the
juror,
the
defense
counsel
said
“let
state
proceed”
and
then
there
was
further
questioning.
i
say
simply
that
when
a
juror
indicates
this,
lacking
any
indication
or
any
objection
on
the
part
of
the
defense
counsel
that
that
juror
has
indicated
that
he
has
some
predisposition
in
the
case
and
that
the
excusing
of
those
jurors
on
that
basis
is
not
unreasonable.
now
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
yes,
justice
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no
juror
can
sit
down
on
a
capital
case
with
who
has
conscientious
scruples
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty?
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that's
--
that's
close
to
it.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
say
that
--
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
it
would
--
that
it
might
very
well
be,
but
i
don't
think
that
we
have
that
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
the
case
law
in
illinois
--
there
were
no
case
in
illinois
has
ever
held
that
mere
opposition
in
and
of
itself,
aside
from
the
question
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
your
honor.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
logan
case
which
was
an
1892
year
--
a
case
decided
in
1892
by
this
court,
that
was
exactly
the
question
that
was
asked,
“have
you
any
conscientious
scruples
in
regard
to
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
for
crime?”
and
14
jurors,
prospective
jurors
were
excused
there.
and
this
court
held
that
a
prospective
juror
who
had
conscientious
scruples
on
any
subject
had
indicated
that
he
could
not
be
impartial.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
specifically
defining
what
is
a
conscientious
scruple?
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
in
the
hobbs
case,
they
cited
part
and
a
couple
of
the
other
federal
cases
with
approval,
and
i
think
that
in
those
cases,
it's
clear
that
when
you
talk
about
a
conscientious
or
religious
scruple,
you're
talking
about
more
than
just
a
mere
opposition.
you're
talking
about
a
--
an
opinion.
it
would
seriously
interfere
with
the
juror's
ability
to
render
a
fair
verdict.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
--
in
regard
to
this,
it
said
merely
that
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
act
in
excusing
these
individuals.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecutor
felt
that
by
answering
yes
to
that
question,
the
juror
was
indicating
that
he
was
so
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
that
the
probability
was
great
that
he
would
not
impose
it
under
any
circumstances.
i
would
also
point
out
in
that
respect
that
on
two
other
occasions,
the
defense
counsel
was
the
one
who
benefited.
there
was
one
gentleman
whose
brother's
son-in-law
was
a
policeman
and
he
was
asked
if
he
could
be
fair
and
impartial.
he
said
he
thought
he
could.
and
the,
defense
counsel
said,
“are
you
absolutely
positive?”
and
he
said,
“possibly,
it
might
affect
me”
and
the
trial
court
granted
the
defense's
motion
to
excuse
for
cause.
there
was
another
woman
whose
husband
was
a
policeman
and
in
that
case,
she
said
--
she
was
asked,
“do
you
have
any
leanings
one
way
or
the
other?”
and
the
defense
moved
to
excuse
the
woman
and
the
trial
court
granted
the
defense's
motion
to
excuse
that
woman.
and
what
he
said
was,
“i'm
going
to
grant
the
excuse
for
cause.
you
might
have
some
leanings
one
way
or
the
other.”
what
we're
saying
simply
is
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
the
juror
states
that
he
could
be
fair
and
impartial
on
the
facts
of
that
particular
case,
i
think
that
there's
a
big
chance
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
stop
the
juror.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no.
no,
your
honor.
but
our
contention
is
simply
this,
that
when
the
juror
asked
--
answered
affirmatively
to
that
question,
he
was
indicating
sufficient
intensity
of
bias
in
the
case
to
be
excused
and
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
excuse
him
under
those
circumstances.
the
trial
court
on
numerous
occasions
indicated
that
what
he
was
trying
to
do
is
get
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
with
no
leanings
one
way
or
the
other
way.
he
excused
not
only
these
individuals
but
also
a
couple
of
individuals
on
the
defense's
motion
simply
because
it
was
attempting
to
get
a
jury
which
had
no
predisposition.
and
again,
we
think
that
when
a
jury
answers
affirmatively
to
that
question
that
he
in
fact
has
indicated
that
he
cannot
be
absolute
fair
--
absolutely
fair
and
impartial
to
both
sides
and
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
excuse
them.
i
think
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
not
less
than
14
years.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
there
was
a
statute
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
mr.
witherspoon
was
tried.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
because
i
think
we'd
go
much
broader
than
that
the
entire
theory
of
american
justice
has
always
been
that
if
a
person
indicates
that
he
cannot
be
fair
and
impartial
that
you
excuse
him.
if
a
prospective
juror
in
illinois
states
that
he
thinks
a
policeman
would
be
a
more
credible
witness
than
say
another
individual
that
he
indicates
that
he
doesn't
believe
in
insanity
defense,
he's
excused.
now,
we
think
that
if
a
person
indicates
a
bias
in
some
way
that
he
should
be
excused.
we
think
that
if
a
person
says
that
he
would
not
return
the
death
penalty
verdict
under
any
circumstances
that
this
is
not
a
fair
and
impartial
juror.
we
feel
that
the
question
is
carried
over
sufficiently
enough
and
that
the
very
definition
of
a
conscientious
scruple
has
always
been
in
illinois
and
in
other
jurisdictions
that
this
indicates
an
opinion
of
sufficient
intensity
so
that
it
interfere
with
the
person's
ability
to
weigh
the
possibilities
and
to
reach
at
a
decision.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
i
would
--
again,
there
were
six
that
i
don't
think
that
we
would
quarrel
with
at
all.
i
think
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
okay.
i
think
going
beyond
that,
i
think
that
we
can
--
i
think
that
there
were
certainly
another
group
of
individuals
who
have
heard
this
question
and
it
was
clear
to
them
that
this
is
exactly
what
--
what
the
judge
was
concerned
with,
a
person
who
would
not
under
any
circumstances
impose
a
death
penalty.
now,
again,
i
think
that
even
if
in
fact
a
--
if
a
juror
says,
“i
have
a
conscientious
religious
scruple,”
even
if
he
does
not
fully
understand
--
he
does
not
fully
understand
that
this
means
that
--
it
should
mean
that
he
will
not
under
any
circumstances
impose
the
death
penalty.
we
say
simply
that
it
is
yet
not
unreasonable
and
that
if
in
fact
some
of
those
jurors
were
excused
for
cause
or
perhaps
shouldn't
have
been
that
it
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation.
and
i
think
that
it
ties
in
with
the
point
that
justice
fortas
made
that
it
might
very
well
be
two,
we
remember
that
the
trial
took
place
in
1960.
i
think
the
trial
court's
clearly
indicated
that
he
was
trying
to
come
up
with
12
individuals
who
had
not
feelings
one
way
or
the
other
way,
and
i
think
that's
clearly
did
it
for
both
the
prosecution
and
the
defense.
and
going
in,
they
are
the
two
basic
points,
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
systematic
exclusion
which
is
unreasonable,
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
said
that
a
systematic
exclusion
is
unconstitutional,
that
it
is
always
in
its
opinions,
if
not
explicitly,
implicitly
made
it
clear
that
the
mere
exclusion
of
a
group
of
individuals
is
not
unconstitutional
per
se.
at
every
state,
and
i
think
this
is
directly
involved
in
this
case,
every
state
has
numerous
exemptions.
now,
i
think
that
perhaps
a
fireman
or
a
minister
or
something
like
that,
one
individual
minister
or
one
individual
fireman
or
the
like
might
not
necessarily
be
of
such
--
be
of
such
import
that
perhaps
the
public
good
would
be
hiring
the
fewer
to
be
called
for
jury
duty.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
classification
and
determine
whether
or
not
it's
reasonable.
when
you
have
an
exclusion
of
individuals
that
is
reasonable
on
its
face,
i
think
that
if
in
fact
one
or
two
or
a
small
number
of
those
individuals
are
not
in
fact
--
if
perhaps
the
exclusion
of
a
few
of
these
individuals
is
not
warranted,
i
think
nevertheless,
we
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation.
the
cross-section
of
the
community
concept,
which
mr.
jenner
discusses
has
never
had
any
independent
constitutional
right.
it's
always
been
tied
in
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
an
arbitrary
systematic
exclusion.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
it
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
understand
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
understand,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
the
classification
of
quakers
in
and
of
themselves
i
think
very
well
they
might
be
unconstitutional.
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
we've
said
here.
i
think
what
we
said
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
well,
i
think
that's
the
unreasonable
step
though,
assuming
that
all
quakers
do
in
fact
have
conscientious
religious
scruples.
i
would
simply
point
out
that
setting
up
this
criteria
of
those
having
conscientious
religious
scruples,
we
were
in
fact
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
logan
case
where
they
said
that
a
person
who
has
conscientious
religious
scruples
cannot
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror.
now,
i
would
indi
--
i
would
admit
that
if
in
fact
defense
counsel
had
made
any
attempt
at
any
point
and
said,
“we
object
to
the
execution
--
exclusion
of
that
individual,”
he
might
nevertheless
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror.
i
admit
that
if
he
had
made
an
attempt
to
show
bias
questioning
that
in
fact
any
one
of
those
jurors
could
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror
and
if
he
was
either
not
permitted
to
do
so
or
if
in
fact
he
was
able
to
show
that
these
persons
who
were
excluded
could
in
fact
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror,
then
i
think
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
but
the
definition
is
it
was
set
up
and
was
defined
by
the
law
was
in
effect
that
of
those
individuals
who
could
not
be
fair
and
impartial.
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
any
objection
or
any
argument
made
that
the
statute
said
that
all
jurors
who
could
not
be
fair
and
impartial
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
but
that
--
it
completely
ignores
the
word
scruple
as
it
has
been
defined
for
a
hundred
years,
including
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
we
say
that
an
affirmative
answer
--
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
when
a
person
answers
affirmatively
to
that
question
that
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
set
up
and
if
lacking
any
additional
question
that
that
is
not
an
unreasonable
action
taken
by
the
trial
court.
and
that
if
on
a
few
occasions,
if
a
person's
views
were
not
absolutely
strong
enough
to
exclude
or
which
would
provide
sufficient
grounds
for
excluding
that
person
that
that
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
would
point
out
that
five
of
the
12
jurors
who
were
actually
tendered
were
tendered
by
the
defense
and
not
by
the
prosecution.
so
what
that
indicates
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
was
--
that
was
not
the
practice
followed
in
all
of
them.
initially,
three
out
of
the
first
12
jurors
were
interrogated
at
some
length.
it
wasn't
as
perfunctory
as
the
defense
counsel
would
make
this
court
believe.
there
was
extended
questioning
of
three
of
the
first
11
jurors.
after
that,
it
might
have
been
perhaps
a
little
more
perfunctory,
but
again,
i
would
point
out
that
five
of
the
12
jurors
that
were
tendered
were
tendered
by
the
defense,
which
means
that
they
had
the
opportunity
to
examine
this
panel.
they
found
those
five
jurors
satisfactory
and
they
tendered
them
to
the
prosecution.
so
these
were
the
ones
who
were
examined
by
them.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--t
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
at
one
point
where
the
prosecution
moved
to
exclude
a
juror
for
cause
and
the
grounds
--
on
the
grounds
of
conscientious
religious
scruples,
what
occurred
was
that
the
judge
asked,
“do
you
have
any
conscientious
religious
scruples
against
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
a
proper
case?”
the
juror
said
yes
and
the
prosecution
said
excused
for
cause.
the
defense
counsel
said
let
the
state
inquire.
i
think
the
prosecution
was
inquiring
and
there
was
further
questioning.
so
there
certainly
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
defense
counsel
from
asking
questions
or
from
asking
--
objecting,
asking
the
prosecution
to
further
clarify
it.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
they
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
on
occasion,
in
fact
it
was
explored
and
we
have
--
we
have
an
additional
problem
here
i
think
that
at
least
in
one
case
in
illinois
and
another
case
from
some
other
jurisdiction,
which
i
read,
the
claim
was
raised
that
in
fact,
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
by
the
fact
that
there
have
been
extended
questioning
of
the
prospective
jurors
on
the
question
of
their
views
as
to
the
death
penalty.
the
claim
was
that
the
trial
was
slanted
in
this
way
and
that
death
penalty
was
unduly
prejudiced.
again,
we
would
simply
say
that
after
the
extended
questioning
of
the
first
few
jurors
where
they
indicated
that
under
no
circumstances
would
they
impose
a
death
penalty
that
perhaps
on
occasion
that
although
the
questioning
was
not
sufficient,
lacking
any
request
for
--
any
request
for
clarification
or
the
like
that
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
action
which
was
taken.
i
think
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
we
think
it's
not
only
that,
your
honor.
your
honor
phrased
it
very
succinctly.
i
think
it's
not
only
that.
i
think
it's
broader
than
that.
i
think
it
goes
as
to
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
have
any
particular
provision
nullified
by
having
jurors
on
the
panel
who
have
a
fixed
bias
in
some
way.
we
feel
that
the
results,
if
the
contentions
are
accepted,
i
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
serious
reappraisal
over
unanimous
verdicts.
we
think
that
the
only
alternative
to
this
argument
is
a
complete
system
of
bifurcated
trials
with
two
juries,
one
sitting
on
the
question
of
guilt
and
one
sitting
on
the
question
of
punishment.
we
think
that
there
is
no
alternative
in
capital
cases
if
in
fact
the
petitioner's
contentions
are
accepted.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
very
--
that
is
the
effect
of
it,
your
honor.
that
is.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
in
so
far
as
those
--
i
believe
there
are
two
jurors
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
understand
your
question
and
i
would
reply
this.
i
would
say
that
it's
--
we
think
clearly
reasonable
to
excuse
a
juror
who
has
an
actual
bias.
now,
we
think
that
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
also
the
instances
of
implied
bias.
for
example,
in
the
erwin
case
decided
by
this
court
where
the
court
said
in
effect
even
though
the
jurors
said
they
could
be
fair
and
impartial,
in
fact
since
they
read
the
newspaper
accounts
and
the
like,
we
think
that
the
possibility
of
their
being
biased
and
therefore,
we're
going
to
reverse
the
conviction.
now,
we
would
say
that
whether
or
not
a
person's
views
are
strong
enough
to
justify
his
excuse
has
always
been
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
trial
court.
we
say
that
it's
not
entirely
unreasonable
for
a
trial
court
to
examine
a
jury
and
if
he
says,
“i
am
opposed
to
the
death
penalty”
if
absent
other
features,
we
do
not
think
that
this
is
entirely
unreasonable.
but
again,
i
would
point
out
that
in
this
case,
we
had
two
jurors
which
might
be
interpreted
that
way
and
to
the
best
of
my
analogy,
there's
never
been
a
practice
in
illinois,
no
case
has
ever
said
that
mere
opposition
is
sufficient.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
now
the
statute
merely
provides
for
cause.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
understand
it's
being
argued
by
amicus
rather.
in
the
answer
to
your
question,
i
would
say
that
if
the
statute
said
that
mere
opposition
is
sufficient,
i
think
i
would
have
to
concede
that
that
would
probably
be
unconstitutional.
if
in
any
one
individual
case
the
question
came
up
where
one
or
two
jurors
or
perhaps
five
jurors
said
“i
am
opposed
to
the
death
penalty”
and
if
there
was
nothing
other
than
that,
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
but
i
agree
with
you
that
if
the
statute
read
that
way
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
--
it
might
be
a
violation
of
state
law,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
we're
excused
from
mere
opposition
of
the
death
penalty?
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
record
in
this
case
and
i
--
the
law
has
always
been
that
the
conscientious
scruple
differ
immensely
from
mere
opposition.
that
is
always
--
that's
been
the
federal
law
and
from
my
reading
of
the
illinois
law,
that
is
the
illinois
law,
that
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
two.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
again,
there
were
again
two
instances
where
--
i
don't
want
to
avoid
your
question.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
--
i'd
say
that
the
excusing
of
two
jurors
under
this
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
per
se.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i'd
say,
your
honor,
that
it
would
have
to
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
i
think
a
much
greater
number
of
jurors
would
have
to
be
excused
than
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
would
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
would
point
out,
your
honor,
that
that
has
occurred
in
some
of
the
cases,
i
believe
puff
and
the
boyd
cases.
that's
exactly
what
happened
where
a
juror
said,
“i
believe
that
someone
who
is
convicted
of
this
crime
should
be
punished
with
a
death
penalty.”
i
--
in
the
recent
speck
case
where
eight
nurses
were
murdered,
one
juror
said,
“i
would
consider
only
the
first
and
third
verdicts”
and
meaning
that
he
would
consider
only
death
and
he
was
excused
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
quarrel
area
but
i
don't
think
that's
unreasonable.
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
couldn't
know
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
which
method,
your
honor?
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
there
are
44
jurisdictions
presently
which
have
same
or
similar
statutes
which
provide
that
a
juror
can
be
excused
for
conscientious
scruples.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
there
are
presently
41
jurisdictions.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
they're
set
forth
in
the
appendix,
i
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
many
of
them
do
say
that,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
well,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
not
specifically
a
statutory
thing.
this
is
a
common
law
thing.
long
before
the
statutes
were
passed,
the
courts
have
been
holding
back.
the
first
case
in
illinois
was
in
1852.
and
that
long
prior
to
the
time
that
many
of
these
statutes
were
passed,
the
courts
of
the
various
jurisdictions
had
been
holding
that
such
is
the
case.
i'm
cutting
in
to
the
states
attorney's
time,
i
--
