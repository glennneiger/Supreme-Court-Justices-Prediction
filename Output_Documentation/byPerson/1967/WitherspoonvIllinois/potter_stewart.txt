justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
that.
since
1961
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
jury
required
in
the
recommendation
of
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
permitted
to
but
not
required
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
does
recommend
the
death
penalty
and
that's
not
binding
on
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it
makes
no
recommendation
at
all,
is
the
judge
authorized
to
impose
the
death
penalty?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
really
as
that
much
bearing
on
this
case
but
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
not
in
this
case
or
in
this
record
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
any
views
in
opposition,
you
mean,
any
views
on
one
side
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
could
properly
be
challenged
for
cause
by
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
filed
like
that
in
this
case,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
a
little
concerned
about
professor
zeisel's
most
recent
work
about
the
propriety
of
our
--
considering
that
this
case
--
i
don't
mean
for
one
moment
to
be
--
to
criticize
anybody
for
any
impropriety.
i
don't
mean
it
in
that
sense
at
all,
but
that's
not
in
the
record.
it
was
not
before
any
of
the
courts
earlier.
it's
been
sent
to
our
library
in
the
last
two
or
three
days
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
and
it
hasn't
been
published
anywhere.
in
other
words,
there's
nothing
in
which
we
can
take
judicial
notice.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
there's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
internal
evidence
in
it
that
it
hasn't
been
because
there
are
some
indications
that
before
publication,
changes
may
be
made.
and
i'd
say
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
suggesting
an
impropriety
but
i
just
wondered
whether
or
not
that's
properly
before
us
or
whether
even
we
could
take
judicial
notice
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
accepted
that,
that
would
result
in
the
overturning
of
the
convictions
of
what
have
we
told,
something
like
8500
people
in
the
united
states,
in
the
adversary
more
sentences.
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
aren't
there
many,
many
other
states
with
or
without
statutes
that
have
a
practice
so
similar
as
to
be
necessarily
swept
in
with
some
of
your
doctrine?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
would
be
true
only
if
we
accept
your
suggestion
based
upon
what's
in
the
record
or
upon
judicial
notice,
that
this
is
an
unrepresentative
jury
with
respect
to
guilt
determination.
in
other
words,
i
suppose
if
you
had
all
the
jurors
were
six
feet
tall
would
be
an
unrepresentative
jury
and
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
unrepresentative
of
the
population
of
the
united
states,
it
wouldn't
be
on
representative
of
the
guilt
determination.
it's
--
and
i'm
suggesting
that
this
might
not
be
an
unrepresentative
jury
vis-a-vis
guilt
determination
but
might
be
an
unrepresentative
jury
vis-à-vis
the
function
and
trust
of
this
illinois
jury
of
imposing
--
of
fixing
the
penalty.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
the
--
are
you
suggesting
that
every
one
of
these
47
people
who
were
excused
for
cause
heard
the
interrogation
of
these
few?
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
doesn't
show
that,
does
it?
it
shows
these
96
veniremen
who
came
in
in
separate
parcels.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
gather
that
what
you're
suggesting
to
us
is
that
when
this
brief
question
was
asked,
this
was
because
the
jurors
had
heard
the
more
lengthy
interrogation
of
the
others.
this
was
called
for
and
incorporated
the
whole
interrogation
of
the
others.
well,
that
would
be
all
very
well
if
you
could
show
that
all
47
of
them
had
heard
it,
but
they
didn't.
the
record
shows
they
didn't.
justice
potter
stewart
that
shows
it
to
whom?
to
you
or
to
whom?
that's
the
basic
question,
is
what
does
the
juror
mean
by
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
is
the
--
whether
it
should
be
the
duty
of
the
counsel
to
find
out.
justice
potter
stewart
just
about
what
this
statute
says,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
waives
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
veverka,
that
brings
me
back
to
my
earlier
question.
this
indicates
that
to
whom
--
do
you
assume
that
this
prospective
juror
knows
all
about
those
decisions
in
illinois
saying
that
having
a
conscientious
scruple
against
capital
punishment
means
all
these
things?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is,
what
does
this
mean
to
the
juror?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
there
were
41
others.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
think
there
are
that
many
that
has
death
penalty.
justice
potter
stewart
41
have
the
death
penalty
and
three
more
have
this
kind
of
a
jury
disqualification?
justice
potter
stewart
i
misunderstood
you
there.
i
thought
you
said
that
california
had
quite
a
different
test
from
this
one
here
over
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
have
before
us
particularly
in
our
case
and
our
particularly
state
involving
a
particular
standard
of
exclusion.
and
i
had
understood
you
to
say
that
california's
standard
of
exclusion
is
quite
different.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
that.
since
