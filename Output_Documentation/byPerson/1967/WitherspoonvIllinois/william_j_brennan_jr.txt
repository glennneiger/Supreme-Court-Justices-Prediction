justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
jury
had
to
fix
them
you
said
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
its
options
were
death,
life
or
a
term
of
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
work
the
other
way
mr.
jenner
suppose
he
says
that
i
certainly
agree
with
the
death
penalty
and
think
of
it
to
be
imposed
in
every
murder
case.
is
that
--
if
you
were
to
say
that
would
be
automatically
disqualified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
why
he
wouldn't
be
excused
because
the
other
way.
is
that
by
interpretation
of
that
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
why
you
suggested
that
this
is
a
ground
only
for
peremptory
challenge
under
your
practice
rather
than
for
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
you
read
the
statute,
it
struck
me
as
it
would
fit,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
why
you
suggest
the
defendant
the
situation
that
i'm
about
to
say
it
would
have
to
exercise
a
peremptory
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
mr.
jenner
then
that
you
don't
think
our
agreement
with
you
would
necessarily
require
illinois
to
introduce
a
system
of
bifurcated
trials?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
doesn't
suggest
--
what
you
favor
would
be
bifurcated
trials
in
the
sense
of
a
jury
on
guilt
or
innocence
and
a
different
jury
on
the
punishment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
the
california
system
for
example
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
jury,
yes.
so
in
that
situation,
it
probably
would
be
no
different,
would
it?
i
mean,
this
problem
that
we're
discussing
today,
you'd
still
have
to
choose
the
jury
and
that's
--
it
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
still
here,
if
you're
going
to
use
the
same
jury
for
both
purposes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
be
so
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
be
so,
mr.
jenner,
if
this
turned
only
on
due
process,
that
is
a
practice
which
infected
the
fact-finding
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
happened,
would
this
extend
as
far
as
justice
white's
idea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
i
don't
fully
understand
it.
are
you
taking
a
position
that
the
correct
standard
under
the
illinois
statute
is
that
you
may
challenge
for
cause
only
those
who
say
they
could
not
bring
in
the
death
penalty
in
any
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
is
it
you
say
the
statute
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is
what
do
you
say
the
statute
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
irrespective
of
any
conscientious
scruples
they
may
have
against
death
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
still
haven't
answered
my
question,
with
all
respect.
i
don't
know
what
is
your
position
the
statute
means.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
the
purpose.
tell
me
what
it
means.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
specifically
in
what
case
does
the
statute
permit
a
challenge
for
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
that's
an
equal
protection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
it
might
be
different.
what
if
it
were
only
a
due
process
in
the
sense
of
infecting
the
fact-finding
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
--
and
wasn't
that
distinction
drawn
in
linkletter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
actually,
all
the
courts'
confession
rules
and
gideon
rules,
those
are
all
fully
retroactive,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
why
--
weren't
they
made
so
on
the
ground
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it
doesn't
come
