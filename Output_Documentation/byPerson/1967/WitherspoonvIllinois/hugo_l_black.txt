that

mr.
jenner,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.

why
was
743
repealed?
justice
hugo
l.

so
what
is
this
whole
part?
justice
hugo
l.

i
just
thought
that
--
i
saw
that
the
jury
now
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
except
to
advice.

does
the
defendant's
attorney
have
thought
in
hand
to
question
the
jurors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
could
ask
him
if
he
wants
to
do
it
but
despite
this
thing,
if
they
can
give
a
fair
trial,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
nothing
to
prevent
that,
is
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
what
you're
arguing
is
that
illinois
provides
that
in
certain
cases,
people
must
suffer
the
death
penalty
if
they're
found
guilty
of
the
crime.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
constitution,
federal
constitution
doesn't
compel
illinois
to
nullify
that
right
it
has
to
sentence
to
death
by
starting
out
a
jury
of
12,
all
of
them
say,
“we
entered
this
bar
dedicated
to
being
against
the
death
penalty
and
that
is
our
firm
belief.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference
in
effect
in
our
holding
that
illinois
is
barred
by
the
federal
constitution
in
having
a
death
system,
death
execution,
holding
on
the
other
hand,
the
difference
between
that
and
holding
that
they
must
be
compelled
to
try
their
cases
where
jurors
will
announce
from
the
beginning
they
do
not
believe
in
the
death
sentence
and
will
not
impose
it.
justice
hugo
l.

suppose
you
would
ask
the
jurors

they
were
in

inflicting

penalty

every
man
who's
convicted
of
any
--
of
killing
of

you'd

into

that
was

him

you?
