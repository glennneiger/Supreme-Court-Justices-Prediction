chief

warren
number
1015,
william
c.
witherspoon,
petitioner
versus
illinois
et
al.
i
have
with
mr.
jenner
who
was
to
speak
first.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
i
can
see
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
motion
is
granted.
mr.
jenner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
mr.
jenner
he
merely
says
i'm
opposed
of
the
death
penalty
and
nothing
else,
what
is
the
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jenner,
how
--
how
far
does
your
proposal
carry
us?
would
you
--
what
would
you
say
in
the
situation
where
--
is
your
response
that
he
has
a
conscientious
scruple
that
would
prevent
him
from
brining
in
a
capital
verdict
regardless
of
the
facts
or
the
law
has
given
to
him
by
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
veverka.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
the
--
didn't
the
court
itself
take
over
the
examination
of
a
lot
of
these
jurors
and
then
just
preemptively
excused
them?
i'm
looking
now
at
page
29
of
the
appendix
where
the
judge
says,
“do
you
have
any
conscientious
scruples
against
the
effects
of
the
death
penalty
in
a
proper
case?”
the
juror
says,
“i
think
my
conscience
would
bother
me.”
the
judge,
“you
don't
believe
in
the
death
penalty?”
“no,
i
don't.”
“even
though
it
is
a
state
law?”
“that's
right.”
the
court,
“you
may
stand
aside.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
rather
preemptory
to
me.
the
one
above
it
is
just
about
this
brief.
the
judge
asked
him
if
he
had
any
--
any
scruple,
conscientious
scruples
and
he
said,
“yes,
sir.”
“do
you
say
you
do?”
“yes,
sir.”
“how
long
have
you
entertained
such
views?”
“i
don't
believe
in
it,
sir.”
“you
just
don't
believe
in
it?”
“that's
right.”
“very
well,
you'll
be
excused
in
this
case.”
that's
rather
preemptory
and
it
doesn't
spoil
the
man's
mind
very
much,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
defend
that
portion
of
your
act,
which
says
that
they
may
be
excused
for
cause
if
they
--
if
they're
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
entirely?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
principle.
do
you
oppose
--
do
you
seek
to
sustain
that
portion
of
your
act
which
says
that
they're
entitled
to
--
they
should
be
excused
for
cause
if
they
are
opposed
to
the
death
penalty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
that
some
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
indicate
that
any
modification
of
the
rule,
even
to
the
extent
that
i
proposed
to
you,
was
objectionable
to
them.
is
that
the
position
of
the
state
of
illinois
or
do
you
--
do
you
concede
that
if
a
man
merely
says,
“i'm
opposed
to
the
death
penalty.
i
don't
like
it,”
and
there's
no
further
discussion
of
it,
no
further
exploration
that
the
judge
can
say,
“you're
excused”
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
just
a
few
of
them
--
if
just
a
few
of
them
who
are
--
who
are
treated
that
way,
would
it
be
alright?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
faced
here
with
a
statute
which
says
that
that
is
sufficient
and
you
also
have
some
instances
in
this
case
where
that
was
done.
are
you
defending
that
fate
of
it
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
answer
it
and
i
won't
bother
you
anymore.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
would
you
say
that
had
to
be
excused
with
that
reason
before
it
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they're
not
all
to
that
effect,
are
they?
aren't
--
don't
some
of
them
say
that
--
many
of
them
say
that
they
must
have
conscientious
scruples
which
would
prevent
them
from
bringing
in
a
verdict
of
the
death
in
the
proper
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
you
can't
have
any
broad
generalization
other
than
that,
can
you?
along
the
lines
you
said,
41
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
alright.
alright.
mr.
zagel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
seek
to
sustain
that
portion
of
the
statute
which
says
that
a
man
should
be
excused
if
he's
opposed
of
the
death
penalty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
--
would
you
have
any
--
do
you
have
any
cases
to
support
that
theory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
i
didn't
get
that.
who
said
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who's
brief
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
page
7?
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
repeat
the
question
one
of
the
other
justices
asked
you?
to
this
effect,
how
are
jurors
supposed
to
know
these
things
you're
telling
us
about
now
as
to
the
extent
of
their
conscientious
objections?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
between
a
scruple
and
a
conscientious
scruple?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
every
prospective
juror
should
know
those
distinctions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
all
of
them
were
not
asked
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
granucci.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
you
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
--
that
less
than
a
assurance
on
the
part
of
the
juror
that
he
could
not
bring
in
such
a
verdict,
that
they
should
disqualify
him
for
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
they
do.
now,
what
are
you
trying
to
do?
are
you
trying
to
go
farther
than
california
goes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
that
--
even
though
that
is
not
--
you're
not
concerned
with
that
under
the
california
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
you
may
go
to
that.
you
may
have
a
few
minutes
more
to
take.
chief
justice
earl
warren
take
five
minutes
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
were
to
hold
that
in
this
case,
that
this
statute
cannot
stand
because
it
doesn't
show
that
a
man
cannot
render
a
verdict,
a
capital
verdict,
would
that
--
would
that
do
anything
to
the
75
convictions
you
were
talking
about
in
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
