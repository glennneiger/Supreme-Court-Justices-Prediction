mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
whose
favor
your
honors
granted
certiorari
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
in
this
case
here,
the
petitioner
stands
convicted
by
jury
in
cook
county,
illinois
of
the
murder
of
a
policeman
and
the
fixing
by
that
jury
of
the
penalty
of
death.
the
case
as
i
said
comes
of
the
court
by
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
unanimously
on
writ
of
error
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding
rejected
the
position
of
the
petitioner
which
i
have
the
privilege
of
presenting
to
your
honors
today
and
affirm
the
dismissal
of
the
post-conviction
petition
which
we
filed
myself,
my
partner
mr.
sullivan
and
mr.
solovy
in
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
your
honors,
limited
the
grant
of
certiorari
to
the
following
question,
whether
the
operation
of
the
illinois
statute
providing
that
in
a
murder
case,
the
state
could
challenge
for
a
cause
all
prospective
jurors
who
were
opposed
to
or
had
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment,
deprived
the
petitioner
of
a
jury
which
fairly
represented
a
cross
section
of
the
community
and
interpolating
in
that
scope
of
venireman
were
arbitrarily
and
systematically
disqualified
and
excluded
for
cause.
and
did
this
assure
the
state
of
a
jury
whose
members
were
partial
to
the
prosecution
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
i
interpolate
in
that
only
none
scope
of
venireman
where
judge
qualified
to
serve
all
these
in
violation
of
the
petitioners'
rights
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
out
of
the
sixth
amendment,
to
due
process
and
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
because
in
some
aspects
of
the
issues
or
sub-issues
that
are
raised
here,
the
course
of
these
proceedings
appeal
wise
and
convict
--
post-conviction
wise
will
have
i
respectfully
suggest
that
will
appear
some
vary.
i
will
take
a
minute
or
two
to
indicate
the
post-conviction
course
of
these
proceedings.
the
petitioner
was
indicted
in
october
of
1959.
he
elected
on
his
trial
to
be
tried
by
a
jury.
he
is
an
indigent
that
has
been
indigent
throughout
and
has
been
a
representative
throughout
these
proceedings
by
court
appointed
counsel
several
successively
in
some
respects
having
an
effect
upon
his
ability
to
preside
this
matter
eventually
to
your
honors
in
a
posture
which
would
have
enable
him
possibly
to
avoid
some
of
the
problems
here
particularly
that
of
possible
retroactive
application
of
your
honor's
decision
if
your
honors
hold
--
uphold
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
as
i
say,
he
was
represented
by
a
court
appointed
counsel
on
his
trial.
when
that
trial
was
completed,
that
court
appointed
counsel
withdrew,
new
court
appointed
counsel
at
the
suggestion
of
the
defense
of
prisoner's
committee
of
the
chicago
bar
association
took
--
came
into
the
case
and
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
on
that
appeal,
the
appellant
was
unsuccessful.
the
court
appointed
counsel
again
withdrew.
the
permission
sought
from
this
court,
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
draft
and
prepare
and
submit
to
the
court
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
and
this
court
quite
properly
advised
the
petitioner
that
it
did
not
appoint
counsel
to
prepare
petitions
for
presentations.
the
petitioner
then
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
appoint
counsel
but
by
that
time,
the
period
for
the
filing
of
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
had
expired.
that
counsel,
however,
in
his
behalf
because
of
the
appointment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
continued
in
the
case
and
he
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
that
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
of
failure
to
exhaust
state
court
remedy.
he
then
filed
an
illinois
post-conviction
hearing
proceeding
under
the
illinois
post-conviction
hearing
act
with
the
predecessor
of
the
uniform
act
and
this
was
dismissed
and
a
writ
of
error
was
denied
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
january
1964
with
a
little
memorandum
order
not
in
a
published
opinion.
he
then
applied
for
an
original
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
was
denied.
his
counsel
then
persisting
went
back
to
the
united
states
district
court
to
reinstate
the
habeas
corpus
petition
in
that
court
that
had
there
before
had
been
dismissed
on
the
ground
of
the
state
court
remedies
had
not
been
exhausted.
in
that
proceeding
before
his
entertained
to
partial
that
court
sustained
in
part
the
petition
of
the
petitioner
primarily
and
not
an
issue
before
this
court
that
we
do
refer
to
it
in
a
footnote
on
the
ground
of
a
sentencing
procedure
in
illinois
was
in
another
respect
violation
--
violated
the
constitution
in
that
if
a
petitioner
elect
to
a
defendant
elect
to
be
tried
by
jury
his
penalty
whether
death,
imprisonment
or
otherwise
under
the
statute
was
fixed
by
the
jury
without
the
possibility
of
extenuating
and
mitigating
the
circumstances
being
presented
for
the
jury
whereas
if
he
pleaded
guilty
or
if
he
took
a
trial
before
the
court
those
extenuating
circumstances
were
permissible.
they
presented
to
the
court
in
the
sentencing
procedure.
however,
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit,
that
court
reversed
and
the
directed
the
dismissal
of
the
petition.
at
this
point
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
your
honor,
a
second
habeas
corpus
petition
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
present
counsel
now
appearing
before
your
honors
were
appointed
by
his
honor
judge
parson
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
in
that
case.
upon
examining
the
record,
we
determine
that
the
state
court
remedies
we
sought
might
not
have
been
exhausted
or
we
anticipated
another
motion
to
dismiss
on
that
ground
and
we
filed
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
another
post-conviction
hearing
petition,
stating
in
the
petition
not
only
categorically
but
by
our
points
that
we
embrace
every
possible
post-conviction
procedure
there
might
be
in
illinois
in
this
petition
whether
coram
nobis,
coram
vobis,
habeas
corpus,
the
illinois
statutory
post-conviction
or
whatever
it
might
be,
we
wanted
all
of
it,
so
we
would
avoid
the
technical
--
possible
technical
defenses.
we
raised,
if
your
honors
please,
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
in
that
petition,
the
issue
which
is
now
before
your
honors
and
i
wish
frankly
to
state
that.
that
petition
was
dismissed
after
hearing
and
briefs
very
carefully
considered
and
the
written
error
was
allowed
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
under
our
statute.
that
court
by
a
unanimous
decision
written
for
the
court
by
his
honor
walter
v.
schaefer,
justice
schaefer
rejected
the
issue
what
is
presented
to
your
honors
as
well
as
other
points
which
we
raised
in
the
petition.
we
then
filed
the
petition
here
raising
many
grounds
but
this
one
in
particular
or
at
least
that
your
honors
might
have
felt
with
particular
at
one
you
wanted
to
consider
and
you're
allowed
to
search.
now,
that
is
the
general
background.
under
the
illinois
law
in
effect,
statutory
law
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
petitioner
and
at
the
time
he
elected
to
embrace
his
right
of
trial
by
jury
under
the
illinois
and
federal
constitutions.
if
one
indicted
for
murder,
exercise
his
right
to
trial
by
jury,
the
same
jury
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
also
passes
and
passed
upon
the
question
of
the
penalty
whether
it
would
be
under
the
statute,
death,
life
or
a
term
of
years
not
less
than
14
years
and
this
was
binding
upon
the
court.
presently
since
1961,
a
death
penalty
verdict
is
not
binding
upon
the
court.
if
there's
no
death
penalty
recommended
by
the
jury
the
judge
fixes
the
penalty
at
a
term
for
a
year.
i've
been
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
since
1961.
mr.
albert
e.

jr.
it
is
permitted
to
but
not
required.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
not.
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
not
on
this
particular
case
but
it
might
if
the
court
sustains
our
position
and
the
position
is
applied
generally
throughout
the
country.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
your
honor
and
neither
as
this
statute
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
the
one
that
was
in
effect
of
the
time
of
trial
which
is
of
the
jury
that
is
required
to
or
have
the
option
to
fix
the
penalty
of
death,
life
imprisonment
or
a
term
of
years
not
less
than
14
years
and
that
decision
was
binding
on
the
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
was,
your
honor.
now,
superimposed
as
it
goss
and
we
think
--
an
impermissible
goss
on
these
procedures
where
section
743
of
illinois
criminal
code
dealing
with
the
exercise
of
challenges
in
death
penalty
cases
and
murder
cases.
it
read,
in
trials
for
murder,
it
shall
be
a
cause
for
challenge
of
any
juror
who
shall
on
being
examined
state
that
he
has
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment
for
that
he
is
opposed
to
the
same.
that
your
honors
is
the
complete
statute.
it
is
no
requirement
of
the
statute
that
the
scruple
or
opposition,
the
related
to
guilt
or
innocence
issue
or
that
it
the
court
inquire
to
whether
the
scruple
held
would
affect
the
perspective
jurors
judgment
on
the
issue
of
penalty
that
he
might
fix
--
required
to
fix
under
the
statute
under
which
this
case
was
tried.
the
practice
in
illinois
under
that
statute
gave
the
practice
even
today
which
we
have
just
a
general
cause
statute
is
that
a
mere
response
on
the
part
of
the
venireman
and
prospective
juror
that
he
holds
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment
or
that
he
has
post
the
same
then
and
there
without
further
inquiry
disqualifies
that
perspective.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
if
he
would
go
so
far
under
the
illinois
law
as
to
say
that,
if
your
honor
pleases,
then
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
exercise
a
peremptory
challenge.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
not
a
cause.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
practice
as
your
honor
you'll
find
from
the
appendix
to
our
opening
brief
in
which
the
actual
examination
of
all
the
jurors
here,
it
is
that
if
he
says
that
he
has
opposed
to
the
death
penalty,
he
is
excused
for
cause
if
he
is
challenged
by
the
state.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
don't
have
a
case
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no
i
haven't
but
in
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
i
was
about
to
say
as
your
honor
pleases.
thanks
for
raising
the
matter
that
in
the
fourth
circuit
case,
there
was
one
juror
who
solely
states
again,
he
was
challenged
by
the
defense
and
that
challenge
was
overruled
and
that
it
is
one
of
the
ground
that
that
court
unanimously
holds
that
the
--
that
that
was
a
violation.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no
such
issue
or
fact
in
this
particular
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
cite
that
it
should
be
a
ground
for
challenge
for
a
cause.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
if
your
honor
pleases
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
not.
it
said,
in
trials
for
murder,
it
shall
be
a
cause
for
a
challenge
of
any
juror
who
shall
upon
being
examined
state
that
he
has
conscientious
scruples
against
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
--capital
punishment
or
that
he
has
opposed
of
the
same
and
that
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we
think
the
statute
is
constitutionally
impermissible
because
it
limits
this
right
of
challenge
for
cause
only
to
the
state
and
then
only
on
the
ground
that
he
has
a
conscientious
scruple
against
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
would
have
to
exercise
peremptory
and
i
must
say
in
complete
fairness
that
many
judges
presiding
in
a
criminal
court
of
cook
county
or
the
criminal
division
now
of
cook
county
would
sustain
a
challenge
for
a
cause
or
the
juror
have
so
effects
the
types
of
prejudice
or
view
that
your
honor
have
suggested
that
he
then
should
not
serve
as
a
juror
in
the
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
i
would.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
in
response
to
the
question
put
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
were
an
error
in
a
i
think
minor
respect
but
i
wish
to
correct
the
record.
you
inquired
whether
if
a
venire
even
says
he
will
impose
only
the
death
penalty,
is
that
the
challenge
for
cause?
i
said
that
i
knew
of
no
instance
in
which
the
court
had
refused
or
declined
to
sustain
a
challenge
for
a
cause.
i
said
i
knew
of
no
case
in
illinois
holding
that
it
was
a
ground
for
a
challenge.
there
is
a
case
cited
at
page
6
of
our
brief
as
of
page
5
of
our
opening
brief
in
a
footnote
and
a
decision
--
unanimous
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
interpreting
the
new
statute
which
provides
merely
instead
of
section
731,
we
have
that
the
parties
have
the
right
to
challenge
for
a
cause
when
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
(inaudible)
sustained
that
statute
and
sustained
under
it
the
same
practice
which
was
required
to
be
applied
under
the
statute
which
--
under
which
this
petitioner
was
tried,
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
did
pose,
though
not
at
holding,
we
wonder
whether
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant
would
make
the
same
claim
as
respect
to
scruple
jurors
where
he
faced
with
a
venireman
who
was
of
the
view
that
your
honor
was
the
hub
if
your
honor's
questions.
now,
to
that
extent,
there
is
an
observation
but
no
holding.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
in
response
to
that,
i
would
have
to
preface
by
saying
this
is
a
supposition
on
my
part.
i
do
not
know
in
fact.
it
was
part
of
the
new
criminal
code,
complete
revision
of
the
illinois
criminal
code
that
was
enacted
at
the
1961
session
of
the
legislature
and
in
revising
the
complete
criminal
code,
the
authors
of
that
code,
a
joint
committee
of
the
chicago
and
illinois
state
bar
associations
appointed
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.

mr.

yes,
the
illinois
supreme
court
then,
when
that
issue
came
before
the
court
and
it
was
argued
that
the
generalization
provision
was
intended
by
the
legislature
to
change
practice
there
before

[audio

mr.

in
a
case
tried
before
a
jury.
if
the
jury
doesn't
recommend
death,
then
the
judge
cannot
impose
death.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
mr.
justice
black,
you
posed
a
question
to
me
which
i
responded
in
part
and
the
question
as
i
understood
it
was
what
would
your
position
be
if
a
perspect
--
a
venire
of
respondent
that
he
have
scruples
against
imprisonment
of
a
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
--
punishment
by
imprisonment,
my
response
was
my
position
would
be
the
same.
i
wish
to
add
to
that
or
i
sought
the
liberty
--
i
would
have
sought
the
liberty
of
saying
in
further
response
that
if
whereas
here
no
further
inquiries
were
made
as
to
whether
that
view
or
philosophy
of
this
prospective
juror
is
so
strongly
held
as
to
affect
his
judgment
or
willingness
to
impose
a
verdict
of
guilty,
then
the
difficulty
presented
here
would
still
be
present.
that
is
the
nexus
between
the
view
held
and
the
possible
judgment
of
the
juror
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
they
are
different.
may
i
say
however
that
we
seek
relief
on
both
grounds.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
my
recollection,
i
share
with
your
honor,
on
your
latter
observations
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
that
was
classic
exclusion.
i
thought
that
mr.
justice
fortas
was
confining
his
second
portion
of
his
question
to
the
narrow
question
of
a
case
in
which
this
court
might
have
reversed
because
a
prospective
juror
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
--
was
excluded.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
the
cases
with
which
i'm
familiar
or
at
least
now
i
recall,
i've
read
so
many
in
the
last
several
weeks,
are
all
in
which
this
court
granted
relief
for
all
cases
where
there
were
some
measure
or
systematic
exclusion.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
i
appreciate
your
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
referring
to
that
is
precisely
the
point
to
which
i
made
now,
if
i
have
your
permission
to
turn.
but
before
i
do
that,
because
of
the
systematic
exclusion
claims
made
here,
to
acquaint
your
honors
with
at
least
the
basics
of
the
record
with
respect
to
the
selection
of
the
juror
in
this
case,
jurors
--
the
12
--
all
of
the
12
jurors
in
this
case.
96
veniremen
and
women
were
questioned.
the
practice
in
illinois
is
that
the
state
questions
the
prospective
veniremen
first.
after
examining
a
panel
of
four,
if
acceptable
to
the
state,
the
panel
is
then
tendered
to
the
defense
and
the
defense
questions
of
the
panel
in
either
challenges
for
cause
or
peremptory
challenges
and
eventually
a
panel
is
tendered
back
to
the
state
and
eventually
if
there's
an
agreement
on
the
panel
of
four
and
then
we
proceed
to
the
next
panel
of
four.
now,
here
in
selecting
the
three
panels
of
four
each,
96
prospective
jurors
were
examined,
men
and
women.
47
of
the
96
are
49%
were
excused
for
the
cause
simply
that
they
responded
that
they
had
conscientious
scruples
or
they
were
opposed
to
on
some
modification
in
language
of
their
responses
to
the
death
penalty.
no
inquiry
--
no
inquiry
was
made
as
to
how
strongly
those
views
were
held,
no
inquiry
made
as
to
whether
the
holding
of
the
conscientious
scruples
would
affect
and
to
a
degree
would
affect
the
best
prospective
jurors'
judgment
on
these
fundamental
and
basic
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
nor
was
there
ever
any
inquiry
as
to
whether
that
view
so
held
would
have
an
effect
upon
any
degree
thereof
on
the
question
of
punishment
--
death,
life
or
imprisonment
for
a
term
exceeding
14
years.
the
questions
put,
thought
they
had
variance,
the
question
essentially
was
to
each
juror,
“do
you
have
a
conscientious
or
religious
scruple
against
the
death
penalty?”
sometimes
that
was
added,
or
“are
you
opposed
to…”
or
“do
you
have
an
objection
to
imposition
in
a
proper
case?”
where
a
proper
case
was
never
explained
to
any
of
these
prospective
venire.
that
alone
was
sufficient
ground
for
cause
and
in
each
instance
his
honor
sustained,
the
challenge
for
cause
without
more
inquiry.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
your
honors
please,
the
practice
is
so
set
and
was
so
set
in
illinois
that
the
court
became
impatient
and
he
said
to
mr.
kissane
distinguished
assistant
states
attorney
in
cook
county
was
here
at
the
table.
i
would
go
to
this
juror
and
ask
that
question
first.
let's
get
this
out
of
the
way.
let's
get
all
this
out
of
the
way.
and
at
one
stage
of
the
proceeding,
either
the
court
or
mr.
kissane
at
the
direction
of
the
court
turned
to
the
whole
then
venire
which
happened
to
be
in
the
courtroom
and
said,
“are
there
any
of
you
who
have
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty?”
and
those
who
have
merely
raised
their
hands
without
warrant,
five
of
them
who
just
raised
their
hands,
they
were
excused.
now,
there
were
--
of
these
47
who
were
excused,
there
were
10
men,
9
women,
and
27
which
i
will
have
to
call
neutered.
neuter
because
the
widest
jury
was
selected.
the
number
that
--
veniremen's
number
or
venireladies'
number,
95,
97,
55,
whatever
it
happened
to
be,
the
court
would
say
number
of
ten.
and
either
the
lady
or
gentleman
would
rise
and
the
question
would
be
put
to
the
venireman
without
even
inquiring
as
to
his
or
her
name.
and
if
that
faceless
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
prospective
juror
responded,
“yes,
i
have
conscientious
to
the
scruple”
or
“i'm
opposed
to
the
death
penalty,”
the
judge
said
to
them,
“step
aside.”
that
was
a
typical
word,
to
step
aside.
but
if
they
respond
that
they
didn't,
then
he
said,
“go
into
the
box”
and
then
the
further
questioning
went
on.
so
you
have
27
who
are
identified
by
a
mere
number
here.
now,
only
five
responded
that
they
could
not
impose
the
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances.
the
others'
responses
you'll
notice
in
the
appendix,
both
to
our
opening
brief
and
supplemental
appendix
by
--
in
the
brief
of
the
state
are
the
very
expressions
of
this
reluctance
or
view
with
respect
to
death
penalty
or
opposition
to
death
penalty.
but
there
were
no
direct
inquiries
as
to
the
effect
which
might
--
these
views
held
might
have
upon
either
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
or
on
the
extent
or
nature
or
character
of
the
punishment
to
be
imposed
by
the
jury.
now,
because
of
that
systematic
practice
then
obtaining
and
still
obtaining
in
illinois
that
all
who
express
any
view,
and
i
say
any
because
the
degree
is
a
number
in
the
inquiry
into
the
degree,
of
position
opposed
to
or
conscientious
scruple
against
the
death
penalty
automatically
excuse.
now,
we
say
that
because
there
is
no
rational
relationship
between
the
sustaining
for
cause,
under
that
situation
and
the
issue
of
the
view
of
that
juror,
a
prospective
juror
on
the
issue
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
or
on
issue
of
punishment
that
that
was
then
an
arbitrary
exclusion
resulting
in,
if
your
honors
please,
the
state
in
illinois
tendering
to
the
defense
and
to
the
defendant
despite
the
provision
of
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
the
united
states
that
it
should
be
entitled
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
and
equal
protection
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
he
is
permitted,
the
defendant
and
his
counsel,
to
examine
only
veniremen
who
are
tendered
after
the
state
has
excluded
from
this
cross-section
of
the
community,
all
those
who
hold
any
views
--
any
views
regardless
of
the
degree
on
the
issue
of
the
death
penalty.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
the
fact
here,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
would
have
to
be
a
view
--
at
least,
do
you
have
a
conscientious
scruple
against
the
death
penalty.
it
has
to
go
that
far.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
is
the
problem
and
i
share
with
you
your
observations.
i
wish
to
say
on
that
subject,
if
your
honors
please,
that
it
amounts
to
this,
that
the
state
legislature
has
assumed
without
any
proof,
without
any
inquiry
being
made
of
prospective
jurors,
the
statute
excludes
that
possibility.
that
the
mere
expression
of
opposition
to
the
death
penalty,
the
mere
expression
of
it
regardless
of
degree
to
which
it
is
held
excuses
the
juror
for
a
cause
and
deprives
the
defendant
of
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community
from
which
to
select
a
jury.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
pleases,
and
the
studies
that
are
reported
in
the
briefs
precisely
sustain
that
position
that
jurors,
though
expressing
conscientious
scruples
or
opposition,
whether
that
may
be
to
the
death
penalty,
do
and
have
and
will
assess
the
death
penalty
in
what
they
call
proper
cases,
strong
facts,
whatever
they
might
be.
and
the
percentages
of
those
are
reported
in
professor
han
zeisel's
study,
a
copy
of
which
has
been
lodged
in
the
library
and
there
are
several
copies
that
the
librarian
of
this
court
recently
completed,
other
studies
of
mr.
--
professor
cross
and
professor
wilson,
professor
goldberg
that
these
people
in
proper
cases
do
render
guilty
verdicts
and
do
impose
death
penalty.
as
professor
zeizel,
the
author
with
professor
harry
kalven
jr.
of
the
university
of
chicago
at
the
america
jury
reports
--
in
the
report
now
lodged
with
the
librarian
of
this
court,
about
one-half
--
one-half
of
all
scruple
people
will
vote
to
impose
the
death
penalty
in
what
they
would
regard
as
appropriate
case
and
they
would
be
aggravated
cases.
that's
at
page
7
to
10
of
his
completed
report.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
that
--
that
people
who
are
unscruple
may
not
impose
the
death
penalty.
there's
a
variance
in
all
groups.
well
the
difference,
if
your
honor
pleases,
is
that
if
you
exclude
from
the
venire,
those
who
have
let
us
say
the
more
humane
viewpoint,
then
you
do
not
have
the
viewpoint
expressed
in
the
deliberations
in
the
jury
room
and
you
do
not
have
brought
to
bear
on
the
--
in
what
we
regard
as
a
typical
and
constitutional
american
jury,
a
representative
of
the
democratic
process.
that
in
the
jury
room,
they
would
be
represented
of
all
views,
men
and
women
and
negro
because
i'm
much
a
negro
for
this
reason
that
these
studies
reveal
that
the
negro,
men
and
women,
share
to
a
higher
percentage
scruples
against
death
penalty
than
do
men
and
women
who
are
white,
so
that
this
process
has
resulted
in
illinois.
in
the
exclusion
of
a
greater
percentage
of
negroes
in
death
penalty
cases
than
of
whites,
it
results
in
the
exclusion
of
a
greater
percentage
of
women
from
these
juries
in
which
the
death
penalty
is
asked
than
is
the
average.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
would
say
as
to
that
in
response
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
a
view
--
we
need
not
go
any
further
in
respect
to
this
case.
if
a
prospective
venireman's
sole
response
that
he
would
be
--
that
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
render
the
verdict
as
you
have
indicated
that
that
would
not
be
a
ground
here
on
this
case
for
relief.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
i
would
agree.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no.
i
would
share
the
practice
that
now
prevails
that
the
inquiries
to
such
a
venire
must
bring
up
the
fact
that
the
newspaper
readings
have
so
influenced
him
that
he
could
not
render
a
fair
and
impartial
judgment.
that
is
--
he
is
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
he
should
be
excused
for
cause.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
until
you
go
further
and
examine
that
juror
as
to
the
degree
to
which
his
views
are
held,
to
see
whether
they
would
affect
to
the
extent
of
a
challenge
for
cause,
his
impartiality
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
his
impartiality
on
the
issue
of
penalty,
you
don't
know
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
and
if
your
honor
will
note
when
you
look
at
the
appendix
to
the
opening
brief,
as
well
to
the
appendix
of
the
state
briefs,
the
presiding
judge
in
this
case,
one
of
our
fine
judges
is
now
deceased,
he
occasionally
turn
to
these
prospective
veniremen
and
he
said,
“you
aren't
advancing
that,
are
you,
just
to
get
out
of
jury
service?”
and
they
all
responded
that
they
were
not
those
to
whom
that
question
was
put.
that
is
a
point
that
i
wish
also
to
emphasize,
that
when
a
jury
says
--
juror
--
prospective
juror
merely
says
“i
have
conscientious
scruples”
and
you
don't
go
beyond
that
to
inquire
as
to
how
strongly
those
views
are
held,
you
just
don't
know
whether
the
jury
can
get
through
or
can
give
a
fair
and
impartial
judgment
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
on
the
issue
of
penalty.
and
in
the
recent
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred,
judge
harrison
winter
in
writing
for
the
unanimous
court
there
stated,
we
conclude
that
petitioner
is
entitled
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
because
his
constitutional
rights
were
violate
by
the
manner
in
which
the
jury,
to
determine
this
criminal
responsibility
was
selected
and
particularly
because
the
prosecutor
as
here,
your
honors,
was
allowed
successfully
to
challenge
prospective
jurors
for
a
cause
who
expressed
sentiments
against
capital
punishment
and
thus
to
disqualify
a
substantial
segment
of
the
panel
without
additional
determination
being
made
that
their
objections
to
capital
punishment
would
preclude
them
from
rendering
a
fair
verdict
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
we
confine
our
consideration
therefore
to
that
issue
and
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
a
denial
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
not
necessarily
if
your
honor
pleases,
but
my
judgment
would
be
and
if
i
may
utter
an
observation
on
the
subject
that
in
my
personal
view
that
the
essential
solution
here
of
these
troublesome
problems
is
a
bifurcated
jury.
so
that
the
jury
to
hold
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
presented
maybe
as
free
as
possible
from
the
troublesome
problem
of
what
is
going
to
be
the
penalty
that
will
be
inflicted
and
particularly
whether
the
death
penalty
will
be
inflicted.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
my
personal
view.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that's
that
same
jury.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
but
if,
if
your
honor
pleases,
in
selecting
a
jury
on
the
bifurcated
practice,
if
you
still
permit
a
challenge
for
cause
because
a
juror,
a
prospective
juror
had
scruples
with
respect
to
the
death
penalty,
the
same
problem
that
are
presented
here
are
a
possible
violation
of
the
constitution
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
my
--
my
personal
view.
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
of
course
in
this
particular
case.
now,
as
pointed
out
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
where
you
have
this
existing
practice
applicable
in
case
after
case
after
case,
necessarily
there
is
a
systematic
exclusion
of
a
cross-section
--
a
substantial
segment
and
significant
segment
of
the
community
which
is
a
defendant
is
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
having
jurors
from
that
segment
of
the
community
or
at
least
having
a
consideration
on
whether
they
are
reasonably
impartial,
at
least
not
up
to
the
point
of
being
challenged
for
cause
to
sit
in
judgment
on
his
case
and
bring
their
views
to
the
community.
now,
the
studies
indicated
this
further,
which
the
court
need
not
go
that
far
insofar
as
this
petitioner
is
concerned
to
give
the
petitioner
relief.
that
this
excluded
group,
in
addition
to
the
factors
i've
indicated,
that
it
is
composed
more
of
negro
men
and
women
who
are
more
of
whom
wholly
the
view
against
scruples
or
against
death
penalty
and
more
women
than
men,
but
also
the
mix
of
that
group
indicates
that
the
aggressive
or
authoritarian
or
alter-conservative
type
of
person
is
a
person
who
most
readily
entertains
and
holds
to
the
view
that
the
death
penalty
is
a
proper
punishment
in
murder
cases.
the
--
as
professor
zeisel
reports,
these
people
from
his
studies
are
more
likely
on
a
ratio
of
24
to
1,
24
to
1,
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
the
first
ballot
than
those
who
hold
scruples
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
don't
know
enough
about
it
--
about
its
publication.
i
had
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
--
so
i
don't
know.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
your
honors,
we'll
find
in
the
earlier
reports
by
professor
goldberg
and
by
professor
cross
and
by
professor
wilson,
the
statistics
reported
by
professor
zeisel
are
likewise
reported
in
those
earlier
reports,
so
this
is
amended
without
the
preciseness
of
those
of
professor
zeisel's.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
way
to
cite
this,
do
this
sort
of
thing
as
was
the
practice
in
connection
with
professor
zeisel
and
professor
kalven's
american
jury
project
work
is
either
to
submit
to
a
sample
group
a
state
of
--
statement
of
facts
or
to
reproduce
by
way
of
video
--
recording
tape
or
video
tape
a
trial.
and
then
after
the
subject
has
either
listened
to
or
read
or
looked
at
this
picturization,
then
he
assess
or
she
assess
what
he
or
she
would
have
voted
in
the
event
he
or
she
was
a
juror.
previous
inquiry
hasn't
been
made
of
the
particular
person
as
to
whether
he
or
she
did
or
did
not
hold
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
they
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
they
were
not
in
fact
jurors.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
interplay
of
the
12
juror
--
12
actual
jurors
at
discussing
the
facts
of
the
case
and
determining
how
they
would
reach
the
unanimous
verdict
or
to
reach
one
is
not
present
in
these
--
in
this
sort
of
studies.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
because
we
didn't
reach
that
part
and
we
need
not
reach
it,
if
your
honor
pleases.
the
basic
rule
or
proposition
we're
submitting
to
the
court
here
is
that
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
only
if
the
court
passes
on
to
the
second
phase
of
the
case.
we
take
the
position
that
standing
alone
the
systematic
exclusion
of
a
segment
of
the
community
from
the
jury
venire
panel
from
which
the
jury
is
selected,
itself
as
being
arbitrary
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
and
a
denial
to
the
defendant
an
opportunity
for
having
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
not,
if
your
honor
pleases.
i
think
not.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
because
in
many
of
the
jurisdictions,
you
will
note
in
the
appendix
to
the
briefs
that
the
conscientious
scruple
viewpoint
of
a
particular
prospective
juror
is
keyed
in
with
or
related
to
the
issue
of
judgment
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
or
on
the
--
and
on
the
question
of
the
extent
and
nature
of
the
punishment,
unlike
the
illinois
statute.
so
that
your
honors
can
shape
your
--
the
relief
in
the
case,
according
to
the
--
at
least
in
this
particular
case,
the
limited
and
narrow
question
that
is
presented
here.
there
are
only
five
states
cited
in
the
brief,
arizona,
illinois,
texas,
and
two
other
names
of
which
i
can't
think
of,
who
have
a
statute
such
as
was
in
effect
at
the
time
--
in
illinois
at
the
time
in
this
case
was
decided
or
repracticed
such
as
it
was
under
effect
or
still
no
effect
in
illinois,
that
the
mere
response
of
the
holding
of
the
conscientious
scruple
is
in
and
of
itself
sufficient
challenge
for
a
cause.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
it
must
be
fairly
said
that
your
honor
is
correct,
that
there
are
some
others.
i
do
not
have
them
particularly
in
mind,
but
there
are
some
others.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
would
have
to
concede,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
this
is
why
logically
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
would
not
necessarily
be
so.
if
predicated
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
would
have
my
doubts.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
but
we're
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
where
the
death
penalty
was
asked,
well
not
imposed
by
the
jury.
the
jury
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
forced
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
if,
your
honor
and
mr.
justice
white,
that
is
forcibly
presented
and
argued
by
john
frank
in
his
amicus
curiae
brief
in
the
madden
case,
the
case
is
pending
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
others
of
the
amicus
briefs.
if
the
jury
is
infected,
i
must
say
if
it
is
infected
in
the
sense
that
i
have
indicated
to
the
court,
then
if
a
substantial
segment
of
the
community
is
excised
from
the
jury
panel
from
which
the
petit
jury
is
to
be
selected,
then
there
has
been
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
of
due
process.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
personally,
i
am
disturbed
with
any
exclusion,
if
there's
an
exclusion
that's
difficult
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
jury
with
which
you
finally
wound
up
was
impartial
or
not.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
whose
favor
your
honors
granted
certiorari
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
in
this
case
here,
the
petitioner
stands
convicted
by
jury
in
cook
county,
illinois
of
the
murder
of
a
policeman
and
the
fixing
by
that
jury
of
the
penalty
of
death.
the
case
as
i
said
comes
of
the
court
by
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
unanimously
on
writ
of
error
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding
rejected
the
position
of
the
petitioner
which
i
have
the
privilege
of
presenting
to
your
honors
today
and
affirm
the
dismissal
of
the
post-conviction
petition
which
we
filed
myself,
my
partner
mr.
sullivan
and
mr.
solovy
in
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
your
honors,
limited
the
grant
of
certiorari
to
the
following
question,
whether
the
operation
of
the
illinois
statute
providing
that
in
a
murder
case,
the
state
could
challenge
for
a
cause
all
prospective
jurors
who
were
opposed
to
or
had
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment,
deprived
the
petitioner
of
a
jury
which
fairly
represented
a
cross
section
of
the
community
and
interpolating
in
that
scope
of
venireman
were
arbitrarily
and
systematically
disqualified
and
excluded
for
cause.
and
did
this
assure
the
state
of
a
jury
whose
members
were
partial
to
the
prosecution
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
i
interpolate
in
that
only
none
scope
of
venireman
where
judge
qualified
to
serve
all
these
in
violation
of
the
petitioners'
rights
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
out
of
the
sixth
amendment,
to
due
process
and
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
because
in
some
aspects
of
the
issues
or
sub-issues
that
are
raised
here,
the
course
of
these
proceedings
appeal
wise
and
convict
--
post-conviction
wise
will
have
i
respectfully
suggest
that
will
appear
some
vary.
i
will
take
a
minute
or
two
to
indicate
the
post-conviction
course
of
these
proceedings.
the
petitioner
was
indicted
in
october
of
1959.
he
elected
on
his
trial
to
be
tried
by
a
jury.
he
is
an
indigent
that
has
been
indigent
throughout
and
has
been
a
representative
throughout
these
proceedings
by
court
appointed
counsel
several
successively
in
some
respects
having
an
effect
upon
his
ability
to
preside
this
matter
eventually
to
your
honors
in
a
posture
which
would
have
enable
him
possibly
to
avoid
some
of
the
problems
here
particularly
that
of
possible
retroactive
application
of
your
honor's
decision
if
your
honors
hold
--
uphold
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
as
i
say,
he
was
represented
by
a
court
appointed
counsel
on
his
trial.
when
that
trial
was
completed,
that
court
appointed
counsel
withdrew,
new
court
appointed
counsel
at
the
suggestion
of
the
defense
of
prisoner's
committee
of
the
chicago
bar
association
took
--
came
into
the
case
and
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
on
that
appeal,
the
appellant
was
unsuccessful.
the
court
appointed
counsel
again
withdrew.
the
permission
sought
from
this
court,
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
draft
and
prepare
and
submit
to
the
court
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
and
this
court
quite
properly
advised
the
petitioner
that
it
did
not
appoint
counsel
to
prepare
petitions
for
presentations.
the
petitioner
then
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
appoint
counsel
but
by
that
time,
the
period
for
the
filing
of
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
had
expired.
that
counsel,
however,
in
his
behalf
because
of
the
appointment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
continued
in
the
case
and
he
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
that
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
of
failure
to
exhaust
state
court
remedy.
he
then
filed
an
illinois
post-conviction
hearing
proceeding
under
the
illinois
post-conviction
hearing
act
with
the
predecessor
of
the
uniform
act
and
this
was
dismissed
and
a
writ
of
error
was
denied
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
january
1964
with
a
little
memorandum
order
not
in
a
published
opinion.
he
then
applied
for
an
original
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
was
denied.
his
counsel
then
persisting
went
back
to
the
united
states
district
court
to
reinstate
the
habeas
corpus
petition
in
that
court
that
had
there
before
had
been
dismissed
on
the
ground
of
the
state
court
remedies
had
not
been
exhausted.
in
that
proceeding
before
his
entertained
to
partial
that
court
sustained
in
part
the
petition
of
the
petitioner
primarily
and
not
an
issue
before
this
court
that
we
do
refer
to
it
in
a
footnote
on
the
ground
of
a
sentencing
procedure
in
illinois
was
in
another
respect
violation
--
violated
the
constitution
in
that
if
a
petitioner
elect
to
a
defendant
elect
to
be
tried
by
jury
his
penalty
whether
death,
imprisonment
or
otherwise
under
the
statute
was
fixed
by
the
jury
without
the
possibility
of
extenuating
and
mitigating
the
circumstances
being
presented
for
the
jury
whereas
if
he
pleaded
guilty
or
if
he
took
a
trial
before
the
court
those
extenuating
circumstances
were
permissible.
they
presented
to
the
court
in
the
sentencing
procedure.
however,
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit,
that
court
reversed
and
the
directed
the
dismissal
of
the
petition.
at
this
point
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
your
honor,
a
second
habeas
corpus
petition
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
present
counsel
now
appearing
before
your
honors
were
appointed
by
his
honor
judge
parson
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
in
that
case.
upon
examining
the
record,
we
determine
that
the
state
court
remedies
we
sought
might
not
have
been
exhausted
or
we
anticipated
another
motion
to
dismiss
on
that
ground
and
we
filed
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
another
post-conviction
hearing
petition,
stating
in
the
petition
not
only
categorically
but
by
our
points
that
we
embrace
every
possible
post-conviction
procedure
there
might
be
in
illinois
in
this
petition
whether
coram
nobis,
coram
vobis,
habeas
corpus,
the
illinois
statutory
post-conviction
or
whatever
it
might
be,
we
wanted
all
of
it,
so
we
would
avoid
the
technical
--
possible
technical
defenses.
we
raised,
if
your
honors
please,
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
in
that
petition,
the
issue
which
is
now
before
your
honors
and
i
wish
frankly
to
state
that.
that
petition
was
dismissed
after
hearing
and
briefs
very
carefully
considered
and
the
written
error
was
allowed
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
under
our
statute.
that
court
by
a
unanimous
decision
written
for
the
court
by
his
honor
walter
v.
schaefer,
justice
schaefer
rejected
the
issue
what
is
presented
to
your
honors
as
well
as
other
points
which
we
raised
in
the
petition.
we
then
filed
the
petition
here
raising
many
grounds
but
this
one
in
particular
or
at
least
that
your
honors
might
have
felt
with
particular
at
one
you
wanted
to
consider
and
you're
allowed
to
search.
now,
that
is
the
general
background.
under
the
illinois
law
in
effect,
statutory
law
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
petitioner
and
at
the
time
he
elected
to
embrace
his
right
of
trial
by
jury
under
the
illinois
and
federal
constitutions.
if
one
indicted
for
murder,
exercise
his
right
to
trial
by
jury,
the
same
jury
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
also
passes
and
passed
upon
the
question
of
the
penalty
whether
it
would
be
under
the
statute,
death,
life
or
a
term
of
years
not
less
than
14
years
and
this
was
binding
upon
the
court.
presently
since
1961,
a
death
penalty
verdict
is
not
binding
upon
the
court.
if
there's
no
death
penalty
recommended
by
the
jury
the
judge
fixes
the
penalty
at
a
term
for
a
year.
i've
been

mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
since
1961.
mr.
albert
e.

jr.
it
is
permitted
to
but
not
required.
mr.
albert
e.

jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
not.
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
not
on
this
particular
case
but
it
might
if
the
court
sustains
our
position
and
the
position
is
applied
generally
throughout
the
country.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
your
honor
and
neither
as
this
statute
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
the
one
that
was
in
effect
of
the
time
of
trial
which
is
of
the
jury
that
is
required
to
or
have
the
option
to
fix
the
penalty
of
death,
life
imprisonment
or
a
term
of
years
not
less
than
14
years
and
that
decision
was
binding
on
the
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
was,
your
honor.
now,
superimposed
as
it
goss
and
we
think
--
an
impermissible
goss
on
these
procedures
where
section
743
of
illinois
criminal
code
dealing
with
the
exercise
of
challenges
in
death
penalty
cases

murder
cases.
it
read,
in
trials
for
murder,
it
shall
be
a
cause
for

of
any
juror
who
shall
on
being
examined
state
that
he
has
conscientious
scruples
against

punishment
for
that
he
is
opposed
to
the
same.
that
your
honors
is
the
complete
statute.
it
is
no
requirement
of
the
statute
that
the
scruple
or
opposition,
the
related
to
guilt
or
innocence
issue
or
that
it
the
court
inquire
to
whether
the
scruple
held
would
affect
the
perspective
jurors
judgment
on
the
issue
of
penalty
that
he
might
fix
--
required
to
fix
under
the
statute
under
which
this
case
was
tried.
the
practice
in
illinois
under
that
statute
gave
the
practice
even
today
which
we
have
just
a
general
cause
statute
is
that
a
mere
response
on
the
part
of
the
venireman
and
prospective
juror
that
he
holds
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment
or
that
he
has
post
the
same
then
and
there
without
further
inquiry
disqualifies
that
perspective.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
if
he
would
go
so
far
under
the
illinois
law
as
to
say
that,
if
your
honor
pleases,
then
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
exercise
a
peremptory
challenge.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
not
a
cause.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
practice
as
your
honor
you'll
find
from
the
appendix
to
our
opening
brief
in
which
the
actual
examination
of
all
the
jurors
here,
it
is
that
if
he
says
that
he
has
opposed
to
the
death
penalty,
he
is
excused
for
cause
if
he
is
challenged
by
the
state.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
don't
have
a
case
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no
i
haven't
but
in
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
i
was
about
to
say
as
your
honor
pleases.
thanks
for
raising
the
matter
that
in
the
fourth
circuit
case,
there
was
one
juror
who
solely
states
again,
he
was
challenged
by
the
defense
and
that
challenge
was
overruled
and
that
it
is
one
of
the
ground
that
that
court
unanimously
holds
that
the
--
that
that
was
a
violation.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no
such
issue
or
fact
in
this
particular
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
cite
that
it
should
be
a
ground
for
challenge
for
a
cause.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
if
your
honor
pleases
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
not.
it
said,
in
trials
for
murder,
it
shall
be
a
cause
for
a
challenge
of
any
juror
who
shall
upon
being
examined
state
that
he
has
conscientious
scruples
against
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
--capital
punishment
or
that
he
has
opposed
of
the
same
and
that
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we
think
the
statute
is
constitutionally
impermissible
because
it
limits
this
right
of
challenge
for
cause
only
to
the
state
and
then
only
on
the
ground
that
he
has
a
conscientious
scruple
against
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
would
have
to
exercise
peremptory
and
i
must
say
in
complete
fairness
that
many
judges
presiding
in
a
criminal
court
of
cook
county
or
the
criminal
division
now
of
cook
county
would
sustain
a
challenge
for
a
cause
or
the
juror
have
so
effects
the
types
of
prejudice
or
view
that
your
honor
have
suggested
that
he
then
should
not
serve
as
a
juror
in
the
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
i
would.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
in
response
to
the
question
put
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
were
an
error
in
a
i
think
minor
respect
but
i
wish
to
correct
the
record.
you
inquired
whether
if
a
venire
even
says
he
will
impose
only
the
death
penalty,
is
that
the
challenge
for
cause?
i
said
that
i
knew
of
no
instance
in
which
the
court
had
refused
or
declined
to
sustain
a
challenge
for
a
cause.
i
said
i
knew
of
no
case
in
illinois
holding
that
it
was
a
ground
for
a
challenge.
there
is
a
case
cited
at
page
6
of
our
brief
as
of
page
5
of
our
opening
brief
in
a
footnote
and
a
decision
--
unanimous
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
interpreting
the
new
statute
which
provides
merely
instead
of
section
731,
we
have
that
the
parties
have
the
right
to
challenge
for
a
cause
when
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
(inaudible)
sustained
that
statute
and
sustained
under
it
the
same
practice
which
was
required
to
be
applied
under
the
statute
which
--
under
which
this
petitioner
was
tried,
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
did
pose,
though
not
at
holding,
we
wonder
whether
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant
would
make
the
same
claim
as
respect
to
scruple
jurors
where
he
faced
with
a
venireman
who
was
of
the
view
that
your
honor
was
the
hub
if
your
honor's
questions.
now,
to
that
extent,
there
is
an
observation
but
no
holding.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
in
response
to
that,
i
would
have
to
preface
by
saying
this
is
a
supposition
on
my
part.
i
do
not
know
in
fact.
it
was
part
of
the
new
criminal
code,
complete
revision
of
the
illinois
criminal
code
that
was
enacted
at
the
1961
session
of
the
legislature
and
in
revising
the
complete
criminal
code,
the
authors
of
that
code,
a
joint
committee
of
the
chicago
and
illinois
state
bar
associations
appointed
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.

mr.

jr.
yes,
the
illinois
supreme
court
then,
when
that
issue
came
before
the
court
and
it
was
argued
that
the
generalization
provision
was
intended
by
the
legislature
to
change

there
before

mr.

in
a
case
tried
before
a
jury.
if
the
jury
doesn't
recommend
death,
then
the
judge
cannot
impose
death.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
mr.
justice
black,
you
posed
a
question
to
me
which
i
responded
in
part
and
the
question
as
i
understood
it
was
what
would
your
position
be
if
a
perspect
--
a
venire
of
respondent
that
he
have
scruples
against
imprisonment
of
a
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
--
punishment
by
imprisonment,
my
response
was
my
position
would
be
the
same.
i
wish
to
add
to
that
or
i
sought
the
liberty
--
i
would
have
sought
the
liberty
of
saying
in
further
response
that
if
whereas
here
no
further
inquiries
were
made
as
to
whether
that
view
or
philosophy
of
this
prospective
juror
is
so
strongly
held
as
to
affect
his
judgment
or
willingness
to
impose
a
verdict
of
guilty,
then
the
difficulty
presented
here
would
still
be
present.
that
is
the
nexus
between
the
view
held
and
the
possible
judgment
of
the
juror
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
they
are
different.
may
i
say
however
that
we
seek
relief
on
both
grounds.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
my
recollection,
i
share
with
your
honor,
on
your
latter
observations
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
that
was
classic
exclusion.
i
thought
that
mr.
justice
fortas
was
confining
his
second
portion
of
his
question
to
the
narrow
question
of
a
case
in
which
this
court
might
have
reversed
because
a
prospective
juror
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
--
was
excluded.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
the
cases
with
which
i'm
familiar
or
at
least
now
i
recall,
i've
read
so
many
in
the
last
several
weeks,
are
all
in
which
this
court
granted
relief
for
all
cases
where
there
were
some
measure
or
systematic
exclusion.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
i
appreciate
your
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
referring
to
that
is
precisely
the
point
to
which
i
made
now,
if
i
have
your
permission
to
turn.
but
before
i
do
that,
because
of
the
systematic
exclusion
claims
made
here,
to
acquaint
your
honors
with
at
least
the
basics
of
the
record
with
respect
to
the
selection
of
the
juror
in
this
case,
jurors
--
the
12
--
all
of
the
12
jurors
in
this
case.
96
veniremen
and
women
were
questioned.
the
practice
in
illinois
is
that
the
state
questions
the
prospective
veniremen
first.
after
examining
a
panel
of
four,
if
acceptable
to
the
state,
the
panel
is
then
tendered
to
the
defense
and
the
defense
questions
of
the
panel
in
either
challenges
for
cause
or
peremptory
challenges
and
eventually
a
panel
is
tendered
back
to
the
state
and
eventually
if
there's
an
agreement
on
the
panel
of
four
and
then
we
proceed
to
the
next
panel
of
four.
now,
here
in
selecting
the
three
panels
of
four
each,
96
prospective
jurors
were
examined,
men
and
women.
47
of
the
96
are
49%
were
excused
for
the
cause
simply
that
they
responded
that
they
had
conscientious
scruples
or
they
were
opposed
to
on
some
modification
in
language
of
their
responses
to
the
death
penalty.
no
inquiry
--
no
inquiry
was
made
as
to
how
strongly
those
views
were
held,
no
inquiry
made
as
to
whether
the
holding
of
the
conscientious
scruples
would
affect
and
to
a
degree
would
affect
the
best
prospective
jurors'
judgment
on
these
fundamental
and
basic
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
nor
was
there
ever
any
inquiry
as
to
whether
that
view
so
held
would
have
an
effect
upon
any
degree
thereof
on
the
question
of
punishment
--
death,
life
or
imprisonment
for
a
term
exceeding
14
years.
the
questions
put,
thought
they
had
variance,
the
question
essentially
was
to
each
juror,
“do
you
have
a
conscientious
or
religious
scruple
against
the
death
penalty?”
sometimes
that
was
added,
or
“are
you
opposed
to…”
or
“do
you
have
an
objection
to
imposition
in
a
proper
case?”
where
a
proper
case
was
never
explained
to
any
of
these
prospective
venire.
that
alone
was
sufficient
ground
for
cause
and
in
each
instance
his
honor
sustained,
the
challenge
for
cause
without
more
inquiry.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
your
honors
please,
the
practice
is
so
set
and
was
so
set
in
illinois
that
the
court
became
impatient
and
he
said
to
mr.
kissane
distinguished
assistant
states
attorney
in
cook
county
was
here
at
the
table.
i
would
go
to
this
juror
and
ask
that
question
first.
let's
get
this
out
of
the
way.
let's
get
all
this
out
of
the
way.
and
at
one
stage
of
the
proceeding,
either
the
court
or
mr.
kissane
at
the
direction
of
the
court
turned
to
the
whole
then
venire
which
happened
to
be
in
the
courtroom
and
said,
“are
there
any
of
you
who
have
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty?”
and
those
who
have
merely
raised
their
hands
without
warrant,
five
of
them
who
just
raised
their
hands,
they
were
excused.
now,
there
were
--
of
these
47
who
were
excused,
there
were
10
men,
9
women,
and
27
which
i
will
have
to
call
neutered.
neuter
because
the
widest
jury
was
selected.
the
number
that
--
veniremen's
number
or
venireladies'
number,
95,
97,
55,
whatever
it
happened
to
be,
the
court
would
say
number
of
ten.
and
either
the
lady
or
gentleman
would
rise
and
the
question
would
be
put
to
the
venireman
without
even
inquiring
as
to
his
or
her
name.
and
if
that
faceless
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
prospective
juror
responded,
“yes,
i
have
conscientious
to
the
scruple”
or
“i'm
opposed
to
the
death
penalty,”
the
judge
said
to
them,
“step
aside.”
that
was
a
typical
word,
to
step
aside.
but
if
they
respond
that
they
didn't,
then
he
said,
“go
into
the
box”
and
then
the
further
questioning
went
on.
so
you
have
27
who
are
identified
by
a
mere
number
here.
now,
only
five
responded
that
they
could
not
impose
the
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances.
the
others'
responses
you'll
notice
in
the
appendix,
both
to
our
opening
brief
and
supplemental
appendix
by
--
in
the
brief
of
the
state
are
the
very
expressions
of
this
reluctance
or
view
with
respect
to
death
penalty
or
opposition
to
death
penalty.
but
there
were
no
direct
inquiries
as
to
the
effect
which
might
--
these
views
held
might
have
upon
either
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
or
on
the
extent
or
nature
or
character
of
the
punishment
to
be
imposed
by
the
jury.
now,
because
of
that
systematic
practice
then
obtaining
and
still
obtaining
in
illinois
that
all
who
express
any
view,
and
i
say
any
because
the
degree
is
a
number
in
the
inquiry
into
the
degree,
of
position
opposed
to
or
conscientious
scruple
against
the
death
penalty
automatically
excuse.
now,
we
say
that
because
there
is
no
rational
relationship
between
the
sustaining
for
cause,
under
that
situation
and
the
issue
of
the
view
of
that
juror,
a
prospective
juror
on
the
issue
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
or
on
issue
of
punishment
that
that
was
then
an
arbitrary
exclusion
resulting
in,
if
your
honors
please,
the
state
in
illinois
tendering
to
the
defense
and
to
the
defendant
despite
the
provision
of
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
the
united
states
that
it
should
be
entitled
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
and
equal
protection
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
he
is
permitted,
the
defendant
and
his
counsel,
to
examine
only
veniremen
who
are
tendered
after
the
state
has
excluded
from
this
cross-section
of
the
community,
all
those
who
hold
any
views
--
any
views
regardless
of
the
degree
on
the
issue
of
the
death
penalty.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
the
fact
here,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
would
have
to
be
a
view
--
at
least,
do
you
have
a
conscientious
scruple
against
the
death
penalty.
it
has
to
go
that
far.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
is
the
problem
and
i
share
with
you
your
observations.
i
wish
to
say
on
that
subject,
if
your
honors
please,
that
it
amounts
to
this,
that
the
state
legislature
has
assumed
without
any
proof,
without
any
inquiry
being
made
of
prospective
jurors,
the
statute
excludes
that
possibility.
that
the
mere
expression
of
opposition
to
the
death
penalty,
the
mere
expression
of
it
regardless
of
degree
to
which
it
is
held
excuses
the
juror
for
a
cause
and
deprives
the
defendant
of
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community
from
which
to
select
a
jury.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
pleases,
and
the
studies
that
are
reported
in
the
briefs
precisely
sustain
that
position
that
jurors,
though
expressing
conscientious
scruples
or
opposition,
whether
that
may
be
to
the
death
penalty,
do
and
have
and
will
assess
the
death
penalty
in
what
they
call
proper
cases,
strong
facts,
whatever
they
might
be.
and
the
percentages
of
those
are
reported
in
professor
han
zeisel's
study,
a
copy
of
which
has
been
lodged
in
the
library
and
there
are
several
copies
that
the
librarian
of
this
court
recently
completed,
other
studies
of
mr.
--
professor
cross
and
professor
wilson,
professor
goldberg
that
these
people
in
proper
cases
do
render
guilty
verdicts
and
do
impose
death
penalty.
as
professor
zeizel,
the
author
with
professor
harry
kalven
jr.
of
the
university
of
chicago
at
the
america
jury
reports
--
in
the
report
now
lodged
with
the
librarian
of
this
court,
about
one-half
--
one-half
of
all
scruple
people
will
vote
to
impose
the
death
penalty
in
what
they
would
regard
as
appropriate
case
and
they
would
be
aggravated
cases.
that's
at
page
7
to
10
of
his
completed
report.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
that
--
that
people
who
are
unscruple
may
not
impose
the
death
penalty.
there's
a
variance
in
all
groups.
well
the
difference,
if
your
honor
pleases,
is
that
if
you
exclude
from
the
venire,
those
who
have
let
us
say
the
more
humane
viewpoint,
then
you
do
not
have
the
viewpoint
expressed
in
the
deliberations
in
the
jury
room
and
you
do
not
have
brought
to
bear
on
the
--
in
what
we
regard
as
a
typical
and
constitutional
american
jury,
a
representative
of
the
democratic
process.
that
in
the
jury
room,
they
would
be
represented
of
all
views,
men
and
women
and
negro
because
i'm
much
a
negro
for
this
reason
that
these
studies
reveal
that
the
negro,
men
and
women,
share
to
a
higher
percentage
scruples
against
death
penalty
than
do
men
and
women
who
are
white,
so
that
this
process
has
resulted
in
illinois.
in
the
exclusion
of
a
greater
percentage
of
negroes
in
death
penalty
cases
than
of
whites,
it
results
in
the
exclusion
of
a
greater
percentage
of
women
from
these
juries
in
which
the
death
penalty
is
asked
than
is
the
average.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
would
say
as
to
that
in
response
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
a
view
--
we
need
not
go
any
further
in
respect
to
this
case.
if
a
prospective
venireman's
sole
response
that
he
would
be
--
that
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
render
the
verdict
as
you
have
indicated
that
that
would
not
be
a
ground
here
on
this
case
for
relief.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
i
would
agree.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no.
i
would
share
the
practice
that
now
prevails
that
the
inquiries
to
such
a
venire
must
bring
up
the
fact
that
the
newspaper
readings
have
so
influenced
him
that
he
could
not
render
a
fair
and
impartial
judgment.
that
is
--
he
is
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
he
should
be
excused
for
cause.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
until
you
go
further
and
examine
that
juror
as
to
the
degree
to
which
his
views
are
held,
to
see
whether
they
would
affect
to
the
extent
of
a
challenge
for
cause,
his
impartiality
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
his
impartiality
on
the
issue
of
penalty,
you
don't
know
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
and
if
your
honor
will
note
when
you
look
at
the
appendix
to
the
opening
brief,
as
well
to
the
appendix
of
the
state
briefs,
the
presiding
judge
in
this
case,
one
of
our
fine
judges
is
now
deceased,
he
occasionally
turn
to
these
prospective
veniremen
and
he
said,
“you
aren't
advancing
that,
are
you,
just
to
get
out
of
jury
service?”
and
they
all
responded
that
they
were
not
those
to
whom
that
question
was
put.
that
is
a
point
that
i
wish
also
to
emphasize,
that
when
a
jury
says
--
juror
--
prospective
juror
merely
says
“i
have
conscientious
scruples”
and
you
don't
go
beyond
that
to
inquire
as
to
how
strongly
those
views
are
held,
you
just
don't
know
whether
the
jury
can
get
through
or
can
give
a
fair
and
impartial
judgment
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
on
the
issue
of
penalty.
and
in
the
recent
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred,
judge
harrison
winter
in
writing
for
the
unanimous
court
there
stated,
we
conclude
that
petitioner
is
entitled
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
because
his
constitutional
rights
were
violate
by
the
manner
in
which
the
jury,
to
determine
this
criminal
responsibility
was
selected
and
particularly
because
the
prosecutor
as
here,
your
honors,
was
allowed
successfully
to
challenge
prospective
jurors
for
a
cause
who
expressed
sentiments
against
capital
punishment
and
thus
to
disqualify
a
substantial
segment
of
the
panel
without
additional
determination
being
made
that
their
objections
to
capital
punishment
would
preclude
them
from
rendering
a
fair
verdict
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
we
confine
our
consideration
therefore
to
that
issue
and
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
a
denial
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
not
necessarily
if
your
honor
pleases,
but
my
judgment
would
be
and
if
i
may
utter
an
observation
on
the
subject
that
in
my
personal
view
that
the
essential
solution
here
of
these
troublesome
problems
is
a
bifurcated
jury.
so
that
the
jury
to
hold
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
presented
maybe
as
free
as
possible
from
the
troublesome
problem
of
what
is
going
to
be
the
penalty
that
will
be
inflicted
and
particularly
whether
the
death
penalty
will
be
inflicted.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
my
personal
view.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that's
that
same
jury.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
but
if,
if
your
honor
pleases,
in
selecting
a
jury
on
the
bifurcated
practice,
if
you
still
permit
a
challenge
for
cause
because
a
juror,
a
prospective
juror
had
scruples
with
respect
to
the
death
penalty,
the
same
problem
that
are
presented
here
are
a
possible
violation
of
the
constitution
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
my
--
my
personal
view.
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
of
course
in
this
particular
case.
now,
as
pointed
out
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
where
you
have
this
existing
practice
applicable
in
case
after
case
after
case,
necessarily
there
is
a
systematic
exclusion
of
a
cross-section
--
a
substantial
segment
and
significant
segment
of
the
community
which
is
a
defendant
is
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
having
jurors
from
that
segment
of
the
community
or
at
least
having
a
consideration
on
whether
they
are
reasonably
impartial,
at
least
not
up
to
the
point
of
being
challenged
for
cause
to
sit
in
judgment
on
his
case
and
bring
their
views
to
the
community.
now,
the
studies
indicated
this
further,
which
the
court
need
not
go
that
far
insofar
as
this
petitioner
is
concerned
to
give
the
petitioner
relief.
that
this
excluded
group,
in
addition
to
the
factors
i've
indicated,
that
it
is
composed
more
of
negro
men
and
women
who
are
more
of
whom
wholly
the
view
against
scruples
or
against
death
penalty
and
more
women
than
men,
but
also
the
mix
of
that
group
indicates
that
the
aggressive
or
authoritarian
or
alter-conservative
type
of
person
is
a
person
who
most
readily
entertains
and
holds
to
the
view
that
the
death
penalty
is
a
proper
punishment
in
murder
cases.
the
--
as
professor
zeisel
reports,
these
people
from
his
studies
are
more
likely
on
a
ratio
of
24
to
1,
24
to
1,
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
the
first
ballot
than
those
who
hold
scruples
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
don't
know
enough
about
it
--
about
its
publication.
i
had
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
--
so
i
don't
know.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
your
honors,
we'll
find
in
the
earlier
reports
by
professor
goldberg
and
by
professor
cross
and
by
professor
wilson,
the
statistics
reported
by
professor
zeisel
are
likewise
reported
in
those
earlier
reports,
so
this
is
amended
without
the
preciseness
of
those
of
professor
zeisel's.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
way
to
cite
this,
do
this
sort
of
thing
as
was
the
practice
in
connection
with
professor
zeisel
and
professor
kalven's
american
jury
project
work
is
either
to
submit
to
a
sample
group
a
state
of
--
statement
of
facts
or
to
reproduce
by
way
of
video
--
recording
tape
or
video
tape
a
trial.
and
then
after
the
subject
has
either
listened
to
or
read
or
looked
at
this
picturization,
then
he
assess
or
she
assess
what
he
or
she
would
have
voted
in
the
event
he
or
she
was
a
juror.
previous
inquiry
hasn't
been
made
of
the
particular
person
as
to
whether
he
or
she
did
or
did
not
hold
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
they
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
they
were
not
in
fact
jurors.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
interplay
of
the
12
juror
--
12
actual
jurors
at
discussing
the
facts
of
the
case
and
determining
how
they
would
reach
the
unanimous
verdict
or
to
reach
one
is
not
present
in
these
--
in
this
sort
of
studies.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
because
we
didn't
reach
that
part
and
we
need
not
reach
it,
if
your
honor
pleases.
the
basic
rule
or
proposition
we're
submitting
to
the
court
here
is
that
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
only
if
the
court
passes
on
to
the
second
phase
of
the
case.
we
take
the
position
that
standing
alone
the
systematic
exclusion
of
a
segment
of
the
community
from
the
jury
venire
panel
from
which
the
jury
is
selected,
itself
as
being
arbitrary
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
and
a
denial
to
the
defendant
an
opportunity
for
having
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
not,
if
your
honor
pleases.
i
think
not.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
because
in
many
of
the
jurisdictions,
you
will
note
in
the
appendix
to
the
briefs
that
the
conscientious
scruple
viewpoint
of
a
particular
prospective
juror
is
keyed
in
with
or
related
to
the
issue
of
judgment
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
or
on
the
--
and
on
the
question
of
the
extent
and
nature
of
the
punishment,
unlike
the
illinois
statute.
so
that
your
honors
can
shape
your
--
the
relief
in
the
case,
according
to
the
--
at
least
in
this
particular
case,
the
limited
and
narrow
question
that
is
presented
here.
there
are
only
five
states
cited
in
the
brief,
arizona,
illinois,
texas,
and
two
other
names
of
which
i
can't
think
of,
who
have
a
statute
such
as
was
in
effect
at
the
time
--
in
illinois
at
the
time
in
this
case
was
decided
or
repracticed
such
as
it
was
under
effect
or
still
no
effect
in
illinois,
that
the
mere
response
of
the
holding
of
the
conscientious
scruple
is
in
and
of
itself
sufficient
challenge
for
a
cause.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
it
must
be
fairly
said
that
your
honor
is
correct,
that
there
are
some
others.
i
do
not
have
them
particularly
in
mind,
but
there
are
some
others.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
would
have
to
concede,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
this
is
why
logically
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
would
not
necessarily
be
so.
if
predicated
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
would
have
my
doubts.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
but
we're
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
where
the
death
penalty
was
asked,
well
not
imposed
by
the
jury.
the
jury
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
forced
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
if,
your
honor
and
mr.
justice
white,
that
is
forcibly
presented
and
argued
by
john
frank
in
his
amicus
curiae
brief
in
the
madden
case,
the
case
is
pending
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
others
of
the
amicus
briefs.
if
the
jury
is
infected,
i
must
say
if
it
is
infected
in
the
sense
that
i
have
indicated
to
the
court,
then
if
a
substantial
segment
of
the
community
is
excised
from
the
jury
panel
from
which
the
petit
jury
is
to
be
selected,
then
there
has
been
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
of
due
process.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
personally,
i
am
disturbed
with
any
exclusion,
if
there's
an
exclusion
that's
difficult
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
jury
with
which
you
finally
wound
up
was
impartial
or
not.
thank
you,
your
honors.
