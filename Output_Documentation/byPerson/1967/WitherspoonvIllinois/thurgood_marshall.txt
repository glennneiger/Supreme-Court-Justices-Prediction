justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
urge
upon
us
of
which
you
reject
the
usual
rule
when
somebody
has
read
about
the
crime
in
a
newspaper
that
is
questioned
as
to
whether
he'd
made
up
his
mind,
then
he
convinces
the
court
that
while
he
had
made
up
his
mind,
he
can
give
a
fair
verdict,
would
you
go
that
far?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
would
do
the
same
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
here,
when
he
first
says,
“i
have
conscientious
scruples,”
you
question
him
and
you
might
reject
him,
but
you
wouldn't
automatically
reject
him.
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
might
just
be
illegal
escape
in
jury
service.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
jenner,
how
could
anybody
to
find
out
how
--
how
can
i
find
out
how
i
would
vote
if
i
were
on
the
jury
in
a
murder
case?
if
i
was
never
on
the
jury,
how
could
i
ever
find
out
how
i
would
have
voted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
not
correct
that
we
--
mr.
jenner
is
not
arguing
about
these
six.
he's
arguing
about
the
40
some.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
to
the
contrary,
couldn't
it
mean
that
he,
like
some
other
people,
believe
the
10th
commandment,
thou
shall
not
kill,
and
no
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
the
average
juror
knows
what
the
exact
meaning
of
“a
proper
case”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
veverka,
could
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
the
statute
passed
by
the
state
of
illinois
would
say
that
no
juror
is
qualified
to
sit
on
the
capital
case
who
has
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment.
would
you
think
that
would
be
valid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
uh-huh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
in
illinois,
is
it
common
practice
to
have
jurors
directly
related
to
policemen
in
criminal
cases?
you
mean
that's
not
a
cause
in
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
use
relatives
of
the
prosecutors,
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
is
right
about
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
one
moment.
mr.
jenner
said
that
the
prosecute
against
four
witness
--
four
jurors
and
he
asked
them
about
conscientious
scruples,
they
said
yes,
under
those
circumstances
the
defense
counsel
can
ask
him
anything,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
this
--
you
bring
four
jurors
in,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
prospective
jurors.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
asked
them
do
they
have
conscientious
scruples
and
they
said
yes.
the
judge
says
goodbye.
the
defense
counsel
can't
do
anything
at
that
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
guess
i'll
have
to
read
the
writing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
a
hypothetical
case,
if
41
did,
how
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
uh-huh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
discretionary
with
the
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
usually
done
in
cases
where
you've
got
a
clear-cut
statute
like
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
zagel,
i
suppose
the
practice
in
illinois
would
be
that
when
you
get
a
jury
for
a
capital
case,
the
clerk
of
the
jury
says,
“all
of
you
who
have
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment
are
excused.”
would
that
be
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
96
people
come
into
the
courtroom
and
the
judge
says,
“all
of
you
who
have
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment
are
excused,”
is
that
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
hadn't
been
approved
by
this
court,
has
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
i
assume
that
some
of
the
jurors
do
not
know
what
a
proper
case
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there
is
a
possibility
--
there's
a
two-pronged
possibility
of
a
juror
and
a
judge
at
the
prosecute
--
the
defense
counsel
being
on
a
different
understanding
based
on
the
lack
of
communication,
one
as
to
what
is
a
conscientious
scruple
and
two,
what
is
a
proper
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
suppose
the
juror
ends
up
and
says,
“i
think
that
if
there
is
a
proper
case,
i
could
put
my
conscientious
scruples
aside.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
be
qualified?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so,
these
41,
you
don't
know
how
many
of
them
might
have
gone
to
that
point
if
they
had
been
questioned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
would
have
no
objections
of
the
defense
counsel
going
into
as
far
as
he
wanted
in
the
hope
of
getting
this
out
of
the
way.
that
would
be
alright
with
you?
justice
thurgood
