mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
allude
first
of
all
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
marshall
to
the
effect
of
whether
a
defense
lawyer
can
intervene
during
the
course
of
the
voir
dire.
i
might
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
illinois
law
to
prevent
this.
it
has
been
done.
it
has
been
done
in
cases
i've
tried
myself.
if
they
challenge
for
cause,
if
a
lawyer
feels
that
a
challenge
for
cause
has
not
been
sufficiently
established,
he
may
ask
the
court
the
relief
to
ask
questions.
it
was
not
done
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
do
not
think
that
it's
discretionary
with
the
court.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
would
say
this,
that
i
--
i
think
--
well,
i
think
i
have
to
emphasize
the
point
that
mr.
veverka
made
toward
the
end.
it's
really
i
think
misleading
to
regard
this
as
a
--
particularly
as
a
statutory
provision.
first
of
all,
the
challenge
for
cause
of
one
who
had
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty
existed
prior
to
the
time
of
the
statute
and
was
created
in
a
case
called
gates
versus
people
on
14
illinois
and
after
the
statute
was
eliminated
from
the
statute
books,
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
law
was
the
same.
second
of
all,
the
clear
provision
of
the
statute
is
that
anyone
who
is
opposed
of
capital
punishment
shall
be
excluded
but
i
know
of
no
single
record
that
a
petitioner
is
brought
forth
on
in
which
a
states
attorney
or
a
court
asked
the
question
of
any
prospective
jury
man,
“are
you
opposed
to
capital
punishment?”
the
question
has
always
been
whether
there
are
conscientious
or
religious
scruples
and
i
think
that
the
statute
was
a
surplusage
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
first
footnote
to
the
respondent
wood's
brief,
we
set
out
the
law
of
--
all
of
the
states
have
considered
this
and
we
point
out
that
even
in
most
of
those
states
where
statutes
have
been
passed,
the
challenge
for
cause
originally
arose
at
the
time
of
the
law
and
we
point
out
further
that
the
interpretations
of
these
statutes
has
been
such
that
one
could
no
longer
i
think
arguably
state
that
this
is
a
matter
of
statutory
law.
particularly,
i
point
out
that
many
of
the
statutes
set
by
the
petitioner
say
personally
of
such
scruples
which
will
preclude
him
from
returning
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
that
most
typical
of
this
is
california
and
the
western
states
have
similar
statutes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
very
much
doubt
that
that
would
be
alright.i
think
one
needs
the
intervention
of
the
court.
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
that
has
been
done
and
it
has
been
approved
in
the
state
of
illinois.
however,
it
was
not
done
in
this
case.
each
juror
was
asked
individually.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
it
has
only
been
approved
in
the
state
of
illinois
but
the
better
practice
and
the
practice
followed
in
this
case
has
been
to
qualify
each
juror
individually
and
i
would
ask
as
--
that
you
notice
mr.
veverka
has
previously
noted
the
instance
in
which
a
judge
was
somewhat
reluctant
to
accept
the
juror's
--
for
original
assurance
that
there
was
a
conscientious
scruple.
it
was
only
after
the
juror
insists
--
insisted
that
the
juror
was
taken
off.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
don't
seek
to
sustain
that
portion
of
the
statute.
i
don't
think
that
portion
of
the
statute
was
applied
in
this
case,
and
i
dare
say
that
if
i
conceded
that
it
was
per
se
unconstitutional,
that
a
single
illinois
case
would
be
reversed
as
a
result
of
it.
the
overwhelming
practice
in
illinois
has
just
been
on
the
basis
of
conscientious
scruples
and
mere
opposition
is
not
sufficient
under
illinois
law
regardless
of
what
the
statute
has
said.
that
is
the
practice
in
our
law.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
--
in
footnote
4,
the
respondent
woods
brief,
i
put
in
every
case
that
i
could
find
in
illinois
that
dealt
with
conscientious
scruples
with
the
disqualification
for
cause
and
all
of
--
none
of
them
has
dealt
specifically
with
the
problem
which
is
in
itself
and
indication
of
the
fact
that
trial
courts
do
not
ask
the
question,
“are
you
opposed?”
every
one
of
those
cases
dealt
with
disqualification
of
jurors
on
the
grounds
that
they
had
religious
or
conscientious
scruples
against
the
infliction
of
capital
punishment.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
that
was
the
standard
the
trial
judge
was
applying
with
this
limitation.
i
think
the
comments
of
the
trial
judge
is
on
the
six
jurors
or
five
jurors
to
which
in
his
previous
reference
indicated
that
the
trial
judge
understood
that
standard
to
mean
a
conscientious
scruple
that
would
have
a
substantial
influence
on
the
verdict.
i
might
further
add
in
connection
with
this
question
of
the
voir
dire
in
illinois.
it
is
true
that
all
of
these
jurors
came
in
a
group
of
three
--
in
three
large
groups
and
it's
impossible
to
tell
exactly
when
they
came
in
because
when
the
trial
judge
brought
them
up
for
their
preliminary
instruction,
he
made
a
statement
somewhat
to
the
effect
of
bringing
those
jurors
who
have
come
in
up
to
the
front
so
you
don't
know
when
they
came
in.
but
i
do
point
out
that
in
addition
to
the
comments
of
the
judge
indicating
that
he
was
only
interested
in
those
cases
where
a
person
would
not
inflict
the
death
penalty
in
any
case,
i
might
add
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
judge
said
that
on
--
on
a
few
occasions,
on
four
or
five
occasions.
the
reference
to
it
can
be
found
in
the
petitioner's
appendix
and
he
refers
to
it
specifically
on
page
7
of
his
brief
and
makes
references
to
the
appropriate
--
a
portion
of
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
petitioner's
brief,
mr.
witherspoon's
brief.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
page
7,
he
makes
reference
in
the
third
paragraph
on
that
page
to
the
situations
where
the
trial
judge
did
make
it
clear
that
that's
what
he
was
seeking.
i
would
also
point
out
that
each
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
i
am
not
saying
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
am
saying
that
the
practice
in
illinois
--
and
i
think
it
is
a
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
say
the
statute
is
directed
to
the
securing
of
jurors
who
are
willing
under
the
law
and
evidence
to
return
a
death
penalty
verdict
if
justified.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
the
statute
makes
the
assumption,
not
unjustified
assumption,
that
the
persons
with
such
conscientious
and
religious
scruples
will
have
a
great
difficulty
in
returning
such
a
verdict.
and
i
might
add,
and
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
our
position
is
the
statute
is
designed
--
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
statute
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
statute
permits
a
challenge
for
cause
when
a
man
expresses
conscientious
or
religious
scruples
against
inflicting
the
death
penalty.
and
you
say
that
that's
perfectly
constitutional?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
say
that
that
is
perfectly
constitutional.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
it
is
--
it
is
perfectly
constitutional
without
more
and
i
point
out
two
things
in
this
connection.
first,
it's
interesting
that
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
the
turberville
case,
when
faced
with
a
record
where
the
trial
judge
excluded
on
the
basis
of
mere
opposition,
i
held
that
that
was
improper
though
not
reversible
error.
and
then,
when
it
sought
to
define
--
the
court
sought
to
define
what
was
meant
by
challenge
for
cause
in
these
cases,
it
specifically
alluded
to
the
phrase
conscientious
scruple
and
said
that
this
means
more
than
mere
opposition.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
in
this
connection
--
i
should
note
that
there
was
a
question
asked
as
to
whether
or
what
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
about
this
point.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
nothing
about
this.
this
issue,
this
question
of
insufficient
basis
for
the
challenge
for
cause
is
being
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
and
i
might
add
that
it
was
not
raised
even
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
that
there
was
no
attempt
by
a
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
level
to
ask
any
additional
question
in
connection
with
the
disqualification
for
cause.
and
furthermore,
he
made
no
objection
to
any
of
the
disqualification
for
cause.
and
i
might
add
that
the
court
never
denied
any
challenge
for
cause
made
by
defense
counsel
in
this
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
--
i
think
they'll
know
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
i
do
not
think
it
is
an
unfair
or
irrational
assumption
to
make
that
conscientious
scruple
possesses
for
the
juror
the
same
common
meaning
it
possesses
for
the
rest
of
us.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
--
i
think
a
scruple
might
be
sufficient.
sometimes
a
question
in
illinois
is
phrased
as
a
conscientious
or
religious
objection.
i
think
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
sometimes
it's
referred
to
as
a
conscientious
or
religious
objection.
i
think
scruple
is
meant
to
embody
this
idea
of
some
overwriting
moral
principle
or
belief
to
which
the
man
adheres.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
it
is
a
reasonable
assumption
to
say
that
a
prospective
juror
will
either
know
what
it
means
or
will
do
what
mr.
salazar
did
and
ask
what
the
question
meant.
and
furthermore,
and
this
is
something
that
i
was
not
noted
by
mr.
veverka's
and
relied
upon
my
brief.
those
jurors
who
said
they
did
not
have
conscientious
scruples
were
questioned
further
and
this
i
think
was
heard
by
every
venireman
because
it
was
quite
frequent.
it
was
a
question
by
mr.
kissane
to
the
effect
of
if
after
all
the
deliberations
they
were
to
return
to
the
jury
room
and
all
of
them
were
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
as
charged
and
that
they
all
were
convinced
that
this
was
a
proper
case
for
the
death
penalty,
would
they
sign
the
verdict?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
not
all
of
them
were
asked
that
but
i
cannot
believe
that
you
could
reasonably
say
that
not
every
one
of
them
heard
that,
and
i
think
that
in
itself
it
strongly
clarifies
the
meaning
of
the
question.
and
i
might
add,
alluding
to
mr.
veverka's
point
that
the
state
is
between
--
or
say
it's
under
a
sword
here.
a
contention
has
been
made
several
times
in
illinois
and
i
think
it's
made
obliquely
in
the
course
of
petitioner's
brief
that
by
asking
this
second
question,
we
indoctrinate
the
jurors.
we're
put
in
a
position
where
if
we
ask
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty,
they'll
say,
“well,
you're
not
very
clear
on
your
challenge
for
cause,
the
foundation
of
your
challenge
for
cause.”
but
if
you
ask
the
juror
will
he
return
the
death
verdict,
they'll
say
whether
you're
orienting
the
juror
to
the
returning
of
the
death
verdict,
you're
indoctrinating
it.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
possible
that
some
of
the
jurors
may
not
be
aware
of
what
a
proper
case
is.
that
is
to
say
they
may
not
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
primarily
determine
what
a
proper
case
is.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
that
possibility,
although
i
would
state
again
that
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
juror
like
mr.
salazar
did
to
ask
what
is
meant
by
a
proper
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
if
a
juror
were
to
state
that
he
could
return
a
death
verdict
in
a
proper
case,
then
he
would
be
qualified.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
he
would
be
qualified.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
would
say
this.
if
you're
talking
about
knowing
in
the
sense
of
the
absolute
certainty,
no,
i
don't
know.
if
you're
talking
about
knowing
in
the
sense
of
a
reasonable
belief
that
they
did
know,
i
think
i
can't
have
that
reasonable
belief.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
within
--
within
limits.
i
should
point
out
that
there's
a
little
tension
between
what's
being
advocated
today
and
what's
advocated
in
some
other
cases.
in
the
north
carolina
case
in
particular,
what
the
court
complained
about
was
really
a
double
standard.
they
said
that
when
a
man
said
he
had
a
fixed
opinion
as
the
guilt
based
on
newspapers,
the
judge
would
cross-question
him
very
closely
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
were
--
would
be
influenced
by
it.
whereas
as
soon
as
a
man
said
he
had
a
scruple
or
didn't
favor
or
didn't
believe
in
capital
punishment,
then
he
would
knock
him
off
the
jury.
i
would
point
out
that
the
new
procedure,
at
least
the
recommended
one,
the
aba
recommends
it,
is
that
when
a
man
says
he's
got
a
newspaper
opinion,
you
really
shouldn't
cross-question
him
so
closely.
that
it's
--
if
you
can
conceivably
get
a
jury
by
taking
these
people
off
the
jury,
you
should
do
so.
that
was
their
recommendation
where
--
wherever
feasible.
and
i
think
that
the
fourth
circuit
was
right
about
the
double
standard
but
i'd
point
out
in
illinois,
particularly
in
the
speck
case
to
which
counsel
previously
alluded,
a
very
loose
standard
of
challenge
for
cause
was
applied
when
the
defense
asked
for
one.
a
man
expressed
an
opinion
if
he
had
been
acquainted
with
certain
facts
that
everyone
agreed
were
prejudicial.
then
in
those
circumstances,
he
would
be
excused
and
properly
so.
and
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
footnote
of
our
brief
where
we
referred
to
a
recent
federal
civil
rights
prosecution,
a
man
was
asked
--
were
read
the
oath
of
the
ku
klux
clan
and
asked
if
they
believe
and
subscribed
to
the
principles
of
the
clan
oath.
and
if
they
did,
they
said
they
did,
they
were
excused
for
cause.
that
was
rather
in
contrast
to
the
attorney
general
of
alabama's
experience,
richmond
flowers,
when
he
tried
wilkins,
collie
leroy
wilkins
for
the
murder
of
mrs.
liuzzo.
but
in
the
federal
case,
they
did
not
ask
each
and
every
juror
will
these
--
and
in
fact,
i
don't
believe
they
asked
any
juror
will
these
beliefs
affect
you.
and
now,
it
is
possible
that
somebody
who
subscribed
for
the
clan
oath
can
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror
in
a
civil
rights
trial.
theoretically,
it's
possible
but
not
very,
and
i
would
state
that
that
same
basis
for
cause
was
laid
in
this
case.
when
a
man
states
it
is
a
matter
of
his
individual
belief
that
he
has
a
conscientious
or
religious
scruple
against
the
death
penalty,
i
think
that
that
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
cause,
unless
he
wants
to
take
the
whole
law
back
to
the
days
where
you
just
cross-question
everybody
to
try
to
make
incompetent
jurors,
and
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
do
it
in
the
publicity
cases
today.
and
i
would
point
out
that
marshall
versus
united
states
360
u.s.
no
inquiry
was
made.
this
court
just
reversed
on
the
grounds
of
exposure
of
jurors
to
certain
information.
and
i
think
the
same
issue
presents
itself
in
the
civil
rights
case.
i
don't
think
we're
to
use
the
phrase
used
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
from
the
murchison
case
in
his
reply
brief
that
--
in
re
murchison
349
u.s.
133,
the
statement
is
“but
our
system
of
law
has
always
endeavored
to
prevent
even
the
probability
of
unfairness,
thereto”
or
thereto
as
in
publicity
cases,
it
was
the
defendant
who
was
complaining.
i
don't
think
the
standard
of
fairness
of
juries
and
the
threshold
of
disqualification
should
be
any
different
in
the
case
of
a
state
which
is
asking
for
a
fair
trial.
now,
i
have
other
matters
but
i
think
they're
sufficiently
covered
in
my
brief
and
i
would
like
to
have
the
california
attorney
general
speak
for
the
few
minutes
that
are
remaining
in
a
point
which
only
he
has
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
there
are
cases
where
they
could
have
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
evidence
was
just
--
it
could
not
have
justified
a
manslaughter
verdict.
it
was
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
if
they're
--
under
illinois
law,
if
an
instruction
is
submitted,
which
is
not
justified
by
the
evidence
and
a
verdict
of
guilty
returns,
the
illinois
supreme
court
will
set
aside
the
verdict
period
and
reverse
the
case
outright,
there
be
no
remand.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
even
though
it's
in
favor
of
--
even
though
it's
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
if
involuntary
manslaughter
instructions
are
erroneously
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
facts
showed
murder
or
nothing,
the
jury
returns
with
a
verdict
of
guilty.
that
verdict
is
not
good
in
illinois.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
allude
first
of
all
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
marshall
to
the
effect
of
whether
a
defense
lawyer
can
intervene
during
the
course
of
the
voir
dire.
i
might
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
illinois
law
to
prevent
this.
it
has
been
done.
it
has
been
done
in
cases
i've
tried
myself.
if
they
challenge
for
cause,
if
a
lawyer
feels
that
a
challenge
for
cause
has
not
been
sufficiently
established,
he
may
ask
the
court
the
relief
to
ask
questions.
it
was
not
done
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
do
not
think
that
it's
discretionary
with
the
court.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
would
say
this,
that
i
--
i
think
--
well,
i
think
i
have
to
emphasize
the
point
that
mr.
veverka
made
toward
the
end.
it's
really
i
think
misleading
to
regard
this
as
a
--
particularly
as
a
statutory
provision.
first
of
all,
the
challenge
for
cause
of
one
who
had
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty
existed
prior
to
the
time
of
the
statute
and
was
created
in
a
case
called
gates
versus
people
on
14
illinois
and
after
the
statute
was
eliminated
from
the
statute
books,
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
law
was
the
same.
second
of
all,
the
clear
provision
of
the
statute
is
that
anyone
who
is
opposed
of
capital
punishment
shall
be
excluded
but
i
know
of
no
single
record
that
a
petitioner
is
brought
forth
on
in
which
a
states
attorney
or
a
court
asked
the
question
of
any
prospective
jury
man,
“are
you
opposed
to
capital
punishment?”
the
question
has
always
been
whether
there
are
conscientious
or
religious
scruples
and
i
think
that
the
statute
was
a
surplusage
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
first
footnote
to
the
respondent
wood's
brief,
we
set
out
the
law
of
--
all
of
the
states
have
considered
this
and
we
point
out
that
even
in
most
of
those
states
where
statutes
have
been
passed,
the
challenge
for
cause
originally
arose
at
the
time
of
the
law
and
we
point
out
further
that
the
interpretations
of
these
statutes
has
been
such
that
one
could
no
longer
i
think
arguably
state
that
this
is
a
matter
of
statutory
law.
particularly,
i
point
out
that
many
of
the
statutes
set
by
the
petitioner
say
personally
of
such
scruples
which
will
preclude
him
from
returning
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
that
most
typical
of
this
is
california
and
the
western
states
have
similar
statutes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
very
much
doubt
that
that
would
be
alright.i
think
one
needs
the
intervention
of
the
court.
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
that
has
been
done
and
it
has
been
approved
in
the
state
of
illinois.
however,
it
was
not
done
in
this
case.
each
juror
was
asked
individually.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
it
has
only
been
approved
in
the
state
of
illinois
but
the
better
practice
and
the
practice
followed
in
this
case
has
been
to
qualify
each
juror
individually
and
i
would
ask
as
--
that
you
notice
mr.
veverka
has
previously
noted
the
instance
in
which
a
judge
was
somewhat
reluctant
to
accept
the
juror's
--
for
original
assurance
that
there
was
a
conscientious
scruple.
it
was
only
after
the
juror
insists
--
insisted
that
the
juror
was
taken
off.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
don't
seek
to
sustain
that
portion
of
the
statute.
i
don't
think
that
portion
of
the
statute
was
applied
in
this
case,
and
i
dare
say
that
if
i
conceded
that
it
was
per
se
unconstitutional,
that
a
single
illinois
case
would
be
reversed
as
a
result
of
it.
the
overwhelming
practice
in
illinois
has
just
been
on
the
basis
of
conscientious
scruples
and
mere
opposition
is
not
sufficient
under
illinois
law
regardless
of
what
the
statute
has
said.
that
is
the
practice
in
our
law.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
--
in
footnote
4,
the
respondent
woods
brief,
i
put
in
every
case
that
i
could
find
in
illinois
that
dealt
with
conscientious
scruples
with
the
disqualification
for
cause
and
all
of
--
none
of
them
has
dealt
specifically
with
the
problem
which
is
in
itself
and
indication
of
the
fact
that
trial
courts
do
not
ask
the
question,
“are
you
opposed?”
every
one
of
those
cases
dealt
with
disqualification
of
jurors
on
the
grounds
that
they
had
religious
or
conscientious
scruples
against
the
infliction
of
capital
punishment.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
that
was
the
standard
the
trial
judge
was
applying
with
this
limitation.
i
think
the
comments
of
the
trial
judge
is
on
the
six
jurors
or
five
jurors
to
which
in
his
previous
reference
indicated
that
the
trial
judge
understood
that
standard
to
mean
a
conscientious
scruple
that
would
have
a
substantial
influence
on
the
verdict.
i
might
further
add
in
connection
with
this
question
of
the
voir
dire
in
illinois.
it
is
true
that
all
of
these
jurors
came
in
a
group
of
three
--
in
three
large
groups
and
it's
impossible
to
tell
exactly
when
they
came
in
because
when
the
trial
judge
brought
them
up
for
their
preliminary
instruction,
he
made
a
statement
somewhat
to
the
effect
of
bringing
those
jurors
who
have
come
in
up
to
the
front
so
you
don't
know
when
they
came
in.
but
i
do
point
out
that
in
addition
to
the
comments
of
the
judge
indicating
that
he
was
only
interested
in
those
cases
where
a
person
would
not
inflict
the
death
penalty
in
any
case,
i
might
add
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
judge
said
that
on
--
on
a
few
occasions,
on
four
or
five
occasions.
the
reference
to
it
can
be
found
in
the
petitioner's
appendix
and
he
refers
to
it
specifically
on
page
7
of
his
brief
and
makes
references
to
the
appropriate
--
a
portion
of
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
petitioner's
brief,
mr.
witherspoon's
brief.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
page
7,
he
makes
reference
in
the
third
paragraph
on
that
page
to
the
situations
where
the
trial
judge
did
make
it
clear
that
that's
what
he
was
seeking.
i
would
also
point
out
that
each
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
i
am
not
saying
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
am
saying
that
the
practice
in
illinois
--
and
i
think
it
is
a
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
say
the
statute
is
directed
to
the
securing
of
jurors
who
are
willing
under
the
law
and
evidence
to
return
a
death
penalty
verdict
if
justified.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
the
statute
makes
the
assumption,
not
unjustified
assumption,
that
the
persons
with
such
conscientious
and
religious
scruples
will
have
a
great
difficulty
in
returning
such
a
verdict.
and
i
might
add,
and
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
our
position
is
the
statute
is
designed
--
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
statute
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
statute
permits
a
challenge
for
cause
when
a
man
expresses
conscientious
or
religious
scruples
against
inflicting
the
death
penalty.
and
you
say
that
that's
perfectly
constitutional?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
say
that
that
is
perfectly
constitutional.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
it
is
--
it
is
perfectly
constitutional
without
more
and
i
point
out
two
things
in
this
connection.
first,
it's
interesting
that
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
the
turberville
case,
when
faced
with
a
record
where
the
trial
judge
excluded
on
the
basis
of
mere
opposition,
i
held
that
that
was
improper
though
not
reversible
error.
and
then,
when
it
sought
to
define
--
the
court
sought
to
define
what
was
meant
by
challenge
for
cause
in
these
cases,
it
specifically
alluded
to
the
phrase
conscientious
scruple
and
said
that
this
means
more
than
mere
opposition.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
in
this
connection
--
i
should
note
that
there
was
a
question
asked
as
to
whether
or
what
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
about
this
point.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
nothing
about
this.
this
issue,
this
question
of
insufficient
basis
for
the
challenge
for
cause
is
being
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
and
i
might
add
that
it
was
not
raised
even
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
that
there
was
no
attempt
by
a
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
level
to
ask
any
additional
question
in
connection
with
the
disqualification
for
cause.
and
furthermore,
he
made
no
objection
to
any
of
the
disqualification
for
cause.
and
i
might
add
that
the
court
never
denied
any
challenge
for
cause
made
by
defense
counsel
in
this
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
--
i
think
they'll
know
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
i
do
not
think
it
is
an
unfair
or
irrational
assumption
to
make
that
conscientious
scruple
possesses
for
the
juror
the
same
common
meaning
it
possesses
for
the
rest
of
us.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
--
i
think
a
scruple
might
be
sufficient.
sometimes
a
question
in
illinois
is
phrased
as
a
conscientious
or
religious
objection.
i
think
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
sometimes
it's
referred
to
as
a
conscientious
or
religious
objection.
i
think
scruple
is
meant
to
embody
this
idea
of
some
overwriting
moral
principle
or
belief
to
which
the
man
adheres.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
it
is
a
reasonable
assumption
to
say
that
a
prospective
juror
will
either
know
what
it
means
or
will
do
what
mr.
salazar
did
and
ask
what
the
question
meant.
and
furthermore,
and
this
is
something
that
i
was
not
noted
by
mr.
veverka's
and
relied
upon
my
brief.
those
jurors
who
said
they
did
not
have
conscientious
scruples
were
questioned
further
and
this
i
think
was
heard
by
every
venireman
because
it
was
quite
frequent.
it
was
a
question
by
mr.
kissane
to
the
effect
of
if
after
all
the
deliberations
they
were
to
return
to
the
jury
room
and
all
of
them
were
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
as
charged
and
that
they
all
were
convinced
that
this
was
a
proper
case
for
the
death
penalty,
would
they
sign
the
verdict?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
not
all
of
them
were
asked
that
but
i
cannot
believe
that
you
could
reasonably
say
that
not
every
one
of
them
heard
that,
and
i
think
that
in
itself
it
strongly
clarifies
the
meaning
of
the
question.
and
i
might
add,
alluding
to
mr.
veverka's
point
that
the
state
is
between
--
or
say
it's
under
a
sword
here.
a
contention
has
been
made
several
times
in
illinois
and
i
think
it's
made
obliquely
in
the
course
of
petitioner's
brief
that
by
asking
this
second
question,
we
indoctrinate
the
jurors.
we're
put
in
a
position
where
if
we
ask
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty,
they'll
say,
“well,
you're
not
very
clear
on
your
challenge
for
cause,
the
foundation
of
your
challenge
for
cause.”
but
if
you
ask
the
juror
will
he
return
the
death
verdict,
they'll
say
whether
you're
orienting
the
juror
to
the
returning
of
the
death
verdict,
you're
indoctrinating
it.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
possible
that
some
of
the
jurors
may
not
be
aware
of
what
a
proper
case
is.
that
is
to
say
they
may
not
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
primarily
determine
what
a
proper
case
is.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
that
possibility,
although
i
would
state
again
that
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
juror
like
mr.
salazar
did
to
ask
what
is
meant
by
a
proper
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
if
a
juror
were
to
state
that
he
could
return
a
death
verdict
in
a
proper
case,
then
he
would
be
qualified.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
he
would
be
qualified.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
would
say
this.
if
you're
talking
about
knowing
in
the
sense
of
the
absolute
certainty,
no,
i
don't
know.
if
you're
talking
about
knowing
in
the
sense
of
a
reasonable
belief
that
they
did
know,
i
think
i
can't
have
that
reasonable
belief.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
within
--
within
limits.
i
should
point
out
that
there's
a
little
tension
between
what's
being
advocated
today
and
what's
advocated
in
some
other
cases.
in
the
north
carolina
case
in
particular,
what
the
court
complained
about
was
really
a
double
standard.
they
said
that
when
a
man
said
he
had
a
fixed
opinion
as
the
guilt
based
on
newspapers,
the
judge
would
cross-question
him
very
closely
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
were
--
would
be
influenced
by
it.
whereas
as
soon
as
a
man
said
he
had
a
scruple
or
didn't
favor
or
didn't
believe
in
capital
punishment,
then
he
would
knock
him
off
the
jury.
i
would
point
out
that
the
new
procedure,
at
least
the
recommended
one,
the
aba
recommends
it,
is
that
when
a
man
says
he's
got
a
newspaper
opinion,
you
really
shouldn't
cross-question
him
so
closely.
that
it's
--
if
you
can
conceivably
get
a
jury
by
taking
these
people
off
the
jury,
you
should
do
so.
that
was
their
recommendation
where
--
wherever
feasible.
and
i
think
that
the
fourth
circuit
was
right
about
the
double
standard
but
i'd
point
out
in
illinois,
particularly
in
the
speck
case
to
which
counsel
previously
alluded,
a
very
loose
standard
of
challenge
for
cause
was
applied
when
the
defense
asked
for
one.
a
man
expressed
an
opinion
if
he
had
been
acquainted
with
certain
facts
that
everyone
agreed
were
prejudicial.
then
in
those
circumstances,
he
would
be
excused
and
properly
so.
and
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
footnote
of
our
brief
where
we
referred
to
a
recent
federal
civil
rights
prosecution,
a
man
was
asked
--
were
read
the
oath
of
the
ku
klux
clan
and
asked
if
they
believe
and
subscribed
to
the
principles
of
the
clan
oath.
and
if
they
did,
they
said
they
did,
they
were
excused
for
cause.
that
was
rather
in
contrast
to
the
attorney
general
of
alabama's
experience,
richmond
flowers,
when
he
tried
wilkins,
collie
leroy
wilkins
for
the
murder
of
mrs.
liuzzo.
but
in
the
federal
case,
they
did
not
ask
each
and
every
juror
will
these
--
and
in
fact,
i
don't
believe
they
asked
any
juror
will
these
beliefs
affect
you.
and
now,
it
is
possible
that
somebody
who
subscribed
for
the
clan
oath
can
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror
in
a
civil
rights
trial.
theoretically,
it's
possible
but
not
very,
and
i
would
state
that
that
same
basis
for
cause
was
laid
in
this
case.
when
a
man
states
it
is
a
matter
of
his
individual
belief
that
he
has
a
conscientious
or
religious
scruple
against
the
death
penalty,
i
think
that
that
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
cause,
unless
he
wants
to
take
the
whole
law
back
to
the
days
where
you
just
cross-question
everybody
to
try
to
make
incompetent
jurors,
and
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
do
it
in
the
publicity
cases
today.
and
i
would
point
out
that
marshall
versus
united
states
360
u.s.
no
inquiry
was
made.
this
court
just
reversed
on
the
grounds
of
exposure
of
jurors
to
certain
information.
and
i
think
the
same
issue
presents
itself
in
the
civil
rights
case.
i
don't
think
we're
to
use
the
phrase
used
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
from
the
murchison
case
in
his
reply
brief
that
--
in
re
murchison
349
u.s.
133,
the
statement
is
“but
our
system
of
law
has
always
endeavored
to
prevent
even
the
probability
of
unfairness,
thereto”
or
thereto
as
in
publicity
cases,
it
was
the
defendant
who
was
complaining.
i
don't
think
the
standard
of
fairness
of
juries
and
the
threshold
of
disqualification
should
be
any
different
in
the
case
of
a
state
which
is
asking
for
a
fair
trial.
now,
i
have
other
matters
but
i
think
they're
sufficiently
covered
in
my
brief
and
i
would
like
to
have
the
california
attorney
general
speak
for
the
few
minutes
that
are
remaining
in
a
point
which
only
he
has
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
there
are
cases
where
they
could
have
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
evidence
was
just
--
it
could
not
have
justified
a
manslaughter
verdict.
it
was
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
if
they're
--
under
illinois
law,
if
an
instruction
is
submitted,
which
is
not
justified
by
the
evidence
and
a
verdict
of
guilty
returns,
the
illinois
supreme
court
will
set
aside
the
verdict
period
and
reverse
the
case
outright,
there
be
no
remand.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
even
though
it's
in
favor
of
--
even
though
it's
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
if
involuntary
manslaughter
instructions
are
erroneously
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
facts
showed
murder
or
nothing,
the
jury
returns
with
a
verdict
of
guilty.
that
verdict
is
not
good
in
illinois.
