mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
remaining
few
minutes,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
subject
of
retroactivity
of
any
new
rule
to
be
announced
by
this
court,
but
i
would
like
to
emphatically
state
that
we
are
firmly
convinced
that
there
is
no
constitutional
infirmity
in
exclusive
--
in
excluding
for
cause.
in
the
case
of
actual
bias,
those
jurors
are
unable
to
return
a
death
penalty
in
a
capital
case.and
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
we
also
believe
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
california
goes
no
further.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
we
think
on
behalf
of
the
23
states
that
have
joined
us,
we
should
state
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
hold
that
implied
bias,
namely
opposition
or
scruple
as
a
ground
from
which
a
conclusion
may
reasonably
draw
that
the
juror
would
be
unable
to
fairly
consider
the
issue
of
penalty.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
quite
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
thank
you.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
thank
you.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
in
four
recent
decisions,
linkletter,
tehan,
johnson
and
stovall
on
this
court
announced
a
proposition
that
newly
announced
constitutional
rules
need
not
be
given
retrospective
application.
considerations
which
determined
the
retroactivity
or
non-retroactivity
of
these
decisions
are
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
rule,
the
reliance
on
the
old
rules,
and
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
talking
about
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
any
new
rule
here
announced,
i
think
from
the
questions
asked
from
the
bench
and
from
the
direction
of
the
argument,
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
grounds
of
making
jury
selection
less
exclusive.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
an
equal
protection.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
if
it
infected
the
fact
finding
process,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
might
be
taken
into
account
but
it
wouldn't
be
determinative.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
but
it
was
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
however,
there
were
some
other
rules
which
were
made
non-retroactive
which
also
went
to
the
fact-finding
process,
namely
the
recent
stovall
case.
that's
the
one
that
comes
most
readily
to
mind
in
the
line
up
case.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
the
stovall
involved
a
case
where
there
had
been
confrontation
in
the
absence
of
counsel
and
there
was
some
concern
that
--
of
improper
suggestion
and
some
concern
about
unfairness
of
the
trial.
but
the
court
felt
that
this
had
to
be
weighed
against
the
other
considerations
as
well,
namely
the
reliance
on
the
former
rules
and
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
we
think
that
here
should
be
taken
into
account
the
fact
that
regardless
of
what
was
done
with
exclusion,
both
sides
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
had
the
opportunity
to
challenge
for
cause
biased
jurors
and
have
the
opportunity
to
exercise
preemptory
and
therefore
have
an
opportunity
for
a
fair
jury.
now,
as
far
as
reliance,
i
think
logan
versus
the
united
states
certainly
justified
reliance
by
the
states.
and
if
not
logan,
then
the
basic
fundamental
concept
of
our
jurisprudence
that
one
who
is
biased
should
not
sit
as
a
trier
of
fact,
that
one
who
has
a
fixed
opinion
in
a
case
should
not
serve
as
a
juror
in
that
case.
now,
discussing
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice,
we
have
75
men
under
sentence
of
death
in
california,
at
least
70
of
them
have
standing
to
raise
the
scrupled
juror
claim.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
rule
the
court
is
going
to
announce,
but
if
the
court
were
going
to
accept
the
theory
of
the
amicus
on
the
side
of
the
petitioners,
then
it
would
be
error
to
exclude
for
cause,
even
those
who
are
actually
biased.
in
fact,
amicus
are
making
that
argument
in
california
right
now.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
california's
standard
of
exclusion,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
more
restricted.
our
questions,
our
voir
dire
is
primed
in
terms
of,
could
you
return
a
verdict.
and
if
the
venire
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
have
a
bifurcated
trial.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
jurors
are
examined
in
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
they
are
asked,
“could
you
return
a
death
penalty?”
in
other
words,
they
are
asked
first
whether
they
could
--
whether
they
could
return
a
verdict
of
death
if
they
thought
it
was
proper.
i
respect
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it
might
not,
your
honor.
it
might
not.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
--
if
you
were
to
hold
only
in
the
terms
of
your
question,
it
would
not.
however,
it
wouldn't
probably
result
in
collateral
attack
throughout
the
country
on
what
we
conservatively
estimated
as
8500
convictions.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
thank
you,
your
honor.
