justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
about
what
your
statute
provides.
justice
william
o.
douglas
section
743?
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
read
your
statute,
which
is
3
--
section
360
i
guess,
is
it
not?
the
jury,
after
finding
the
person
guilty
of
murder,
can
fix
the
punishment
at
death,
life
imprisonment
or
term
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
not
less
than
14
years.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
what
i
thought,
yeah.
so
under
that
statute,
you're
picking
jurors
that
would
--
why
could
you
pick
jurors
who
would
cover
that
whole
spectrum,
those
who
are
against
life
imprisonment
--
those
who
are
against
life
imprisonment,
those
who
are
against
capital
punishment,
because
that's
within
the
permissible
range
of
punishment
provided
by
the
state.
justice
william
o.
douglas
can
i
ask
one
question
with
the
illinois
law?
could
this
jury
in
this
case
come
back
with
a
--
under
this
indictment
for
the
verdict
of
voluntary
manslaughter
or
manslaughter?
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
not
in
this
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
the
court
--
illinois
court
have
set
it
aside
in
panel
to
a
new
jury
or
what?
justice
william
o.
douglas
even
though
it's
in
favor
of
the
lifetime
penalty.
justice
william
o.
douglas
just
on
the
--
we're
talking
now
about
your
procedure
for
determining
for
the
penalty
or
guilt.
