mr.
william
e.
kelly
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
patricia
waldron
the
executrix
of
the
estate
of
her
late
husband
gerald
b.
waldron,
who
is
the
original
plaintiff
in
this
action.
for
the
purposes
of
simplicity
the
parties
on
this
appeal
continue
to
refer
to
mr.
waldron
as
the
petitioner
or
the
plaintiff.
a
word
of
background;
in
1951
iran
nationalized
its
oil
resources.
up
until
this
time
and
for
many
years
the
anglo-iranian
oil
company,
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
action,
now
known
as
british
petroleum
had
operated
the
iranian
oil
industry
under
a
long
term
concession.
the
act
of
nationalization
in
effect
kicked
the
british
out.
the
british
retaliated
and
in
this
case
when
i
refer
to
the
british,
i
refer
to
the
british
government
as
well
because
british
petroleum
is
51%
owned
by
the
british
government,
retaliated
by
a
boycott
on
iranian
oil.
the
other
defendants
in
this
action
who
are
the
international
major
oil
companies
respected
this
boycott
with
the
result
that
the
iranians
from
the
spring
of
1951,
indeed
throughout
the
entire
period
of
time
we
refer
to
were
unable
to
sell
any
oil
in
the
world
markets.
in
1952
plaintiff
who
conceitedly
did
not
have
any
experience
in
the
oil
business
up
to
that
time
nonetheless
obtained
a
contract
from
the
iranian
government
allowing
him
to
purchase
an
enormous
amount
of
oil,
50
million
metric
tons
of
oil
at
significant
discounts
below
the
posted
persian
gulf
prices.
thereafter
he
attempted
to
sell
this
oil
in
the
united
states
approaching
over
50
independent
oil
companies
and
he
was
unable
to
sell
a
single
drop
of
that
oil.
one
of
the
companies
he
approached
was
the
respondent
cities
service
and
it
is
that
particular
aspect
of
the
case
that
is
before
the
court
today.
his
contract
expired
in
the
summer,
1953.
the
action
itself
was
commenced
on
june
11,
1956.
it
is
of
course
an
action,
treble
damage
anti-trust
action,
a
private
antitrust
action.
almost
immediately
the
defendants
claiming
one
case
at
least
that
they
never
heard
of
plaintiff
obtained
a
stay
of
plaintiff’s
discovery
in
order
to
permit
them
to
depose
him
and
to
frame
answers
in
response
to
the
complaint.
that
stay
which
was
obtained
in
early
july
1956
has
been
enforced
throughout
the
entire
ligation,
11
years.
it
in
enforced
today
but
plaintiff
has
been
under
that
state
for
the
entire
period
of
this
litigation.
he
has
had
no
opportunity
to
conduct
any
general
discovery
whatever.
in
1960
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
the
stay
itself
was
obtained
i
believe
it
was
july
3,
1956,
an
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
stay
of
any
discovery
on
his
part,
preventing
him
from
taking
any
general
discovery.
i
will
return
to
this
point
in
a
moment
your
honor.
i
just
want
to
lay
out
the
overall
action
and
the
appeal.
in
1960
while
the
plaintiff
was
still
under
this
stay
and
after
the
plaintiff
had
been
deposed
cities
moved
for
summary
judgment.
this
motion
was
adjourned
several
times
to
allow
plaintiff
to
conduct
limited
discovery
of
cities
service.
the
motion
was
finally
granted
in
1965.
appeal
followed
to
the
circuit
court
and
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court.
we
make
three
points
on
this
appeal.
first
of
all
that
it
was
error
for
the
district
court
to
limit
plaintiff's
discovery
throughout
the
entire
course
of
this
litigation
and
particularly
when
he
was
forced
to
oppose
a
summary
judgment
by
cities
service,
that
is
point
one
of
our
brief.
point
two
of
our
brief
is
that
in
opposing
this
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
burden
of
showing
treble
issues
of
the
fact
was
placed
on
the
plaintiff.
it
should
have
been
placed
on
the
defendant,
who
in
his
papers
utterly
failed
to
negate
the
allegations
of
conspiracy
and
it
is
that
we
claim
as
the
second
error,
that
is
point
two
of
our
brief.
point
three
of
our
brief
is
even
on
the
limited
facts
that
we
have
been
able
to
gather
in
the
course
of
the
11
years,
we
nonetheless
believe
we
make
out
a
case
for
the
jury
on
the
conspiracy
issue
against
all
defendants.
now
let
me
go
back
and
give
some
of
the
background
facts.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes
the
plaintiff
was
boycotted
completely
from
selling
his
oil
that
he
had
under
this
contract
in
the
united
states
and
i'll
develop
that
point,
i
am
just
coming
to
that
point
factually
right
now.
time
will
not
permit
us
to
discuss
all
of
the
incidents,
but
there
are
two
that
i
think
bear
reputation.
as
i
said
before
when
he
obtained
this
contract
in
may
of
1952,
plaintiff
immediately
got
together
with
a
number
of
other
people,
4
or
5
in
number
and
approached
over
50
independent
american
oil
companies
and
asked
them,
would
they
be
interested
in
purchasing
oil
that
he
had
under
the
contract
from
the
iranian
government.
universally
without
exception,
all
refused
to
deal
with
him
when
they
heard
where
the
oil
was
was
coming
from.
in
good
deal
we've
citied
in
our
four
or
five
specific
examples
one
went
even
so
far
of
putting
a
letter
saying
that
the
threat
of
retaliation
by
the
majors
is
too
great.
now
one
of
the
background
facts
is
important.
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
and
i
am
sure
it
probably
understands
it
anyways
that
99%
of
the
world's
oil
production
is
under
the
control
of
the
six
or
seven
defendants
in
this
action.
the
international
major
oil
companies,
all
other
independent
oil
companies
have
to
purchase
their
oil
from
these
defendants.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
all
of
the
defendants,
oh
yes,
except
one
gulf,
there
has
been
a
settlement,
gulf
has
dropped
out
of
the
case,
it's
now
in
the
position
of
a
co-conspirator.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no,
just
cities,
who
have
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
1960
and
just
that
branch
of
the
case
is
now
before
the
court.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
it
waits.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
just
against
cities
for
the
moment.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
cities
in
the
facts
that
i'm
beginning
to
state
aren't
disputed
by
cities,
i
am
coming
to
the
peculiar
role
of
cities
in
this
particular
matter
in
a
moment
otherwise
the
overall
conspiracy
is
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
this
motion
and
then
we
have
to
deal
with
cities
as
a
particular
exception
i
began
to
point
that
out
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
i
think
i
had
just
reached
the
point
where
i
said
that
none
of
the
independent
oil
companies
would
even
take
this
oil
because
they
were
afraid
of
losing
the
supply
that
they
would
obtain
from
the
major
oil
companies.
one
particular
example
of
how
the
cartel,
if
you
would
please,
touched
the
plaintiff
was
in
the
spring
of
1952,
plaintiff
was
required
to
obtain
a
letter
of
credit
under
his
contract
to
purchase
oil
from
the
iranian
government.
he
went
to
the
chase
national
bank
now
known
as
the
chase
manhattan
bank.
he
was
on
the
verge
of
receiving
a
letter
of
credit
when
a
telephone
call
came
into
the
branch
manager
telling
him
we
can't
do
it.
chase
is
unable
to
do
it
because
it
has
preferred
customers
in
the
oil
business.
branch
manager
very
excited
and
went
downtown
met
the
chase
vice
president
and
this
chase
vice
president
told
him
that
one
of
the
preferred
depositors
or
customers
of
the
chase
bank
was
a
major
oil
company,
the
gulf
oil
company.
colonel
drake
had
issued
instructions,
colonel
drake
being
the
chairman
of
the
board
not
to
give
plaintiff
a
letter
of
credit.
this
is
the
way,
this
is
the
background
fact,
i
don't
think
it's
too
important
but
it
gives
you
an
example
i
think
of
how
this
thing
works.
now
coming
to
cities;
cities
was
not
a
major
international
oil
company
in
1952.
it
was
a
deficit
oil
company.
it
had
to
purchase
oil
from
the
majors.
it
had
purchase
one
half
of
its
daily
requirement
from
the
majors.
one
of
plaintiff's
associates
had
been
a
former
employee
of
cities
service.
he
suggested
that
they
go
to
cities
service
to
see
if
they
would
be
interested
in
plaintiff's
contract
to
purchase
iranian
oil.
they
went
into
see
plaintiff
--
they
went
into
cities,
and
cities
was
vitally
interested
in
this.
there
was
meeting
between
plaintiff's
associates
and
several
of
this
cities
executive
officers.
plaintiff
was
asked,
could
he
go
to
iran
where
he
had
been
to
obtain
this
contract
originally
where
he
met
the
high
officials
of
the
iranian
government
including
premier
mossadegh,
could
you
obtain
an
invitation
to
w.
alton
jones,
the
president
of
cities
service
inviting
mr.
jones
to
iran?
he
said
he
could,
he'd
try
it,
went
back
to
iran,
obtained
the
invitation,
brought
it
back
and
delivered
it
to
the
cities
service's
officers.
jones
was
delighted
at
this
point.
immediately,
he
moved
the
cities
service
executive
personnel
to
see
what
could
be
developed
with
this
opportunity.
a
working
party
was
formed
consisting
of
three
experts
in
the
production,
refining
and
distribution
areas
and
they
together
with
jones
and
plaintiff
and
plaintiff's
associates
left
for
iran
where
there
was
a
three
or
four
week
inspection
of
the
iranian
oil
facilities.
one
of
the
things
that
was
prepared
by
one
of
the
executives
of
cities
service
was
a
draft
report,
a
secret
report
laying
out
how
cities
could
use
this
opportunity
to
ensure
a
long-term
supply
of
oil
and
they
made
no
bones
about
it
this
time,
this
was
a
tremendous
opportunity
for
them
at
this
point.
they
went
to
iran.
now
this
received
a
considerable
amount
of
publicity
back
in
1952.
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
remembers
it
or
not,
i
vaguely
do
myself.
when
they
got
to
iran
there
were
rumors
of
this,
that
the
plant,
the
abadan
refinery
had
been
sabotaged.
they
went
around
and
they
looked
at
it.
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
inspection
tour
and
they
found
that
everything
was
all
right,
there
was
no
particular
problems
at
all.
the
opportunity
was
there,
there
were
no
obstacles
in
the
way.
they
met
with
premier
mossadegh.
jones
had
an
oral
conversation
with
him,
outlined
his
findings,
promised
to
give
mossadegh
a
written
report
upon
on
his
return
to
the
united
states,
and
with
this
they
came
back
to
the
united
states.
now
there's
one
incident
that
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
kuwait
oil
is
in
this
case
and
we
will
hear
a
little
bit
about
it
later.
kuwait
is
a
concession,
kuwait
concession
is
operated,
it's
little
bit
below
iran
on
the
persian
gulf
is
operated
by
british
petroleum
and
gulf
jointly.
in
the
middle
of
these
negotiations
in
iran,
unknown
to
plaintiff,
jones
secretly
went
down
to
kuwait.
what
happened
there,
we
don't
know,
we
don't
have
any
idea.
in
1960,
this
is
very
important
because
it
was
expressly
denied
by
cities
that
jones
had
gone
to
kuwait,
the
very
time
this
motion
was
made,
i'll
comeback
and
explain
the
significance
of
that
in
a
moment
because
jones'
affidavit
was
never,
never
submitted
on
the
summary
judgment
motion
that
is
this
that
what
we
say,
this
is
manner
we
say
that
cities
never
negated
the
conspiracy
in
this
case,
the
allegations
of
conspiracy.
jones
returned
to
the
united
states.
on
the
way
to
and
from
the
united
states,
he
met
with
the
gentleman
named
sandberg
in
holland.
now,
we
don't
know
sabdberg's
role
in
this
case
either
except
watson,
cities
executive
vice
president
believed
him
to
have
a
connection
with
royal
dutch
shell
one
of
the
co-conspirators
in
this
case.
we
don't
know
whether
he
has
that
connection
or
not,
an
affidavit
has
been
submitted
by
mr.
sandberg
in
which
he
denies
any
such
connection.
what
is
known
is
that
sandberg
is
the
head
of
one
of
the
leading
private
banking
houses
in
holland,
pierson
&
heldering.
the
affidavit
that's
submitted
by
sandberg
doesn't
say
what
jones
discussed
for
five
days
on
his
way
to
iran
or
in
the
trip
back.
again,
we
say
this
is
most
significant,
we
don't
know
what
occurred.
the
promised
report
to
mossadegh
was
prepared
by
cities
personnel.
however,
at
this
time
there
began
to
be
an
outcry
against
cities
activities
in
iran.
the
american
petroleum
institute
convention
in
november
1957,
excuse
me,
not
1957,
1952,
jones
went
to
that
convention
bearing
in
mind
that
he's
a
deficit
oil
company.
we
have
in
the
record
what
occurred
an
admission
by
one
of
the
cities'
personnel
to
plaintiff
and
the
quote
is
in
the
record.
“boys,
we
really
got
into
hot
water
over
this
one.
the
big
boys
said
that
they
wish
jones
well
in
his
iranian
oil
venture
and
hoped
he
get
a
lot
of
oil
and
hoped
that
he
got
it
right
away,
because
he
wasn't
going
to
get
any
more
from
them.”
now,
at
this
point
jones
immediately
change
his
direction,
no
longer
is
he
interested
in
plaintiffs
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
well,
that's
a
quote
in
the
deposition.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
of
the
plaintiff
your
honor,
at
page
4034
of
the
plaintiff's
deposition
which
is
some
6000
pages
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no,
it
was
the
statement
by
plaintiff,
two
plaintiffs
by
one
of
the
cities
executive
officers,
a
fellow
named
wetzel
(ph).
mr.
william
e.
kelly
he
died
before
we
ever
to
got
a
chance
to
take
his
deposition
that's
one
of
the
points
we
make
throughout
this
case.
four
or
five
people
have
died
cities'
officers
that
we
have
never
been
able
to
depose,
including
jones,
i'll
come
to
that.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
can't
hear
you.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
my
client's
testimony
occurred
before
mr.
wetzel's
death.
mr.
wetzel
died
in
january
of
1960
as
i
recall.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
well
i
think
cities
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
think
the
point
is
your
honor
when
i
come
to
this
your
honor
and
this
motion
cities
concedes
all
these
facts
except
one
thing
and
that
is
that
sandberg
incident
that
i
just
referred
to,
none
of
these
are
disputed.
after
jones
returned
to
the
united
states
and
after
these
threats,
changed
direction
immediately
and
at
this
point
plaintiff
entree
to
iran
were
dropped.
jones
immediately
began
to
follow-up
another
deal
that
had
been
pending
with
kuwait
oil,
with
gulf
for
the
purchase
of
kuwait
oil.
this
contract
was
finally
executed
in
january
1953,
i'll
come
to
that
again
in
a
moment.
at
the
same
time
jones
began
to
take
the
position
that
the
only
honorable
solution
to
the
iranian
situation
was
to
compromise
with
the
british
and
he
wrote
such
a
letter
to
incoming
secretary
of
state,
dulles
and
incoming
secretary
of
state
brownell
(ph),
he
had
kept
the
united
states
government
informed
what
his
activities
were
during
his
period
going
down
to
washington,
meeting
with
president
truman
before
he
went
to
iran.
now
the
focus
was
entirely
different.
now
it
was
compromised
with
the
british
government,
compromise
with
british
petroleum.
the
promised
report
to
mossadegh
which
we
have
is
an
exhibit
in
this
record
was
never
sent,
it
was
never
sent,
although
we
don't
know
why
because
there
was
one
very
significant
recommendation
in
that
report,
two
recommendations.
one
significant
recommendation
was
that
the
iranians
like
the
mexicans
in
1938
could
begin
to
develop
their
own
oil
markets
that
would
take
them
much,
much
longer
but
there
was
no
obstacles
to
that
approach.
this
report
was
never
sent
so
far
as
we
know.
plaintiff's
contract
expired
in
june
of
1963
as
i
indicated
before
without
him
selling
any
oil
whatsoever.
the
action
was
brought
in
1956.
the
stay
of
discovery
immediately
imposed
and
plaintiff's
depositions
begin
some
60
some,
some
62
or
63
deposition
sessions
were
held
between
1956
and
the
end
of
1958
at
which
time
the
plaintiff
moved
in
the
district
court
for
an
order
terminating
his
deposition
compelling
the
defendants
to
answer.
they
now
knew
enough
about
plaintiff
to
surely
submit
answers
to
the
complaint.
a
motion
was
assigned
and
came
on
to
be
heard
regularly,
the
regular
course
of
the
motion
by
judge
herlands
who
later
was
assigned
to
the
case
for
all
purposes.
judge
herlands
not
denied
the
motion,
but
he
then
increased
the
term
of
the
stay
upon
plaintiff
by
now
giving
defendants,
although
they
hadn't
ask
for
it
at
all,
the
opportunity
to
depose
all
of
plaintiff's
associates
and
send
a
schedule
of
a
174
days
to
complete
the
deposition,
the
cumulative
depositions
of
plaintiff's
associates
and
in
addition
asked
everybody
how
many
more
days
they
needed
to
depose
the
plaintiff.
i
think
the
total
came
to
60
some
odd
sessions.
now
the
entire
schedule
was
filled.
plaintiff
was
in
fact
only
deposed
for
30
some
odd
sessions
more.
the
witnesses'
depositions
i
believe
consumed
some
50
to
60
days,
60
deposition
days.
in
any
event,
the
plaintiff's
deposition
ended
finally
in
i
believe
it
was
january
or
february
of
1960.
cities
immediately
moved
for
summary
judgment.
plaintiff
is
still
under
the
stay
that
i
referred
to.
the
motion
is
an
interesting
one
because
cities
took
the
position
at
this
time
that
since
plaintiff
had
admitted
in
his
testimony,
that
the
two
items,
that
he
saw
in
the
newspapers
in
1954
and
which
caused
him
to
think,
he
had
particularly
no
idea
about
this
before,
an
announcement
of
the
purchase
of
oil
by
cities
from
gulf,
which
had
begun
in
1952,
and
the
fact
that
the
cities
had
gone
into
the
iranian
consortium,
which
was
the
ultimate
solution
to
the
case,
the
ultimate
solution
of
the
iranian
situation.
these
two
events
are
what
caused
the
cities,
they
were
reason
that
caused
plaintiff,
they
were
the
reasons
why
plaintiff
brought
this
action.
cities
therefore
focused
just
on
these
two
issues
in
attempt
to
disprove
them
as
if
they
were
essential
question
in
the
case.
a
motion
came
on
to
be
heard.
mr.
hill's
affidavit
was
the
only
affidavit
submitted
by
cities.
he
was
an
attorney
working
with
cities
and
had
been
the
chief
negotiator
on
the
contract
with
gulf
and
in
connection
with
cities'
opportunities
to
participate
in
the
consortium
situation.
jones'
affidavit
was
never
submitted.
the
motion
came
on.
we
argued
that
it
should
be
denied
because
it
was
impossibly
premature.
we
couldn't
begin
to
oppose
it.
we
haven't
had
deposition
of
jones,
a
key
figure.
we
have
pointed
out
previously
in
1958
that
we
were
losing
time
that
we
ought
to
be
permitted
to
examine
these
witnesses.
we
listed
a
whole
series
of
people
we
wished
to
depose
in
opposition
to
the
motion.
instead,
we
were
told
to
oppose
the
motion
on
the
merits,
and
we
attempted
to
do
so,
emphasizing
however
that
we
wanted
discovery
throughout.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
there
was
a
rule
of
priority
when
the
case
came
on
in
1956.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
if
the
defendants
served
their
notices
first,
they
had
priority
to
complete
the
deposition.
that
rule
has
since
been
changed.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
that's
right.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
it
was
a
rule
that
would
be
considered
to
apply.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
wouldn't
say
so,
but
it's
a
case
on
itself
because
it's
a
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes,
yes
there
was
a
rule
in
effect
it
since
has
been
changed
and
now
there
is
no
priority
as
such
there
can
be
concurrent
discovery,
which
is
of
course
what
we
are
asking
for.
it
wasn't
so
much
that
we
were
protesting
against
our
deposition
be
taking,
which
i
didn't,
but
we
wanted
to
take
the
deposition
of
the
defendants.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
none
as
such,
except
what
i
am
coming
to
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
we
were
giving,
we
were
given
the
right
to
depose
hill
immediately
after
the
conclusion
of
this
first
hearing
on
summary
judgment.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
we
haven't
had
any
to
this
day
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
none.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
now
we
are
coming
to
the
discovery,
the
limited
discovery
we
had
in
connection
with
the
cities
service
motion,
and
of
course
we
asked
that
we
should
have
general
discovery
of
all
defendants,
because
evidence
of
this
conspiracy
could
be
anywhere
on
the
defendants'
files.
we
were
given
the
deposition
of
hill
despite
the
fact
that
we
wanted
jones.
jones'
affidavit
had
been
withheld.
our
position
was
we
had
dealt
with
jones,
we
didn't
know
hill.
i
don't
think
the
plaintiff
had
even
met
hill
except
possibly
once
casually
while
he
was
at
cities
service.
this
deposition
was
taken
and
completed.
it
revealed
very
little
because
hill
didn't
know
anything
to
speak
of.
he
knew
about
the
details
of
the
contract
and
then
in
one
significant
case,
he
didn't
even
know
that
there
had
been
a
most
favored
nation's
letter
obtained
by
direct
dealing
between
jones
and
drake
of
cities
service.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
reply.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
thank
you,
your
honor.
my
opponent
made
the
point
that
we
didn't
ask
for
jones.
i
read
from
the
affidavits
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
1961,
the
motion
first
came
on,
at
this
point
plaintiff
cannot
name
all
the
witnesses
that
would
have
to
be
examined
concerning
the
above
transactions,
but
again
for
the
court's
convenience,
plaintiff
can
list
those
within
the
top
management
with
whom
he
dealt
and
logically
should
have
the
answers,
they
are
as
follows,
the
first
one
w.
alton
jones,
president
and
director
of
cities
service,
the
man
for
whom
the
invitation
was
obtained
from
premier
mossadegh
and
who
headed
the
team
that
went
to
iran.
at
the
oral
argument
of
the
motion,
my
late
partner
said,
“i
think
the
obvious
place
to
begin
is
with
cities
service
with
the
personnel
with
whom
all
these
dealings
were
had,”
and
then
skipping
down
on
page
118
of
volume
iii,
“the
place
to
begin
is
with
w.
alton
jones,”
that
is
in
may
of
1960,
three
years
before
jones
died.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
we
were
under
a
stay,
your
honor,
this
was
the
proceeding
which
we
asked,
give
us
jones.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
a
stay,
we
couldn't
serve
anything.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no,
this
was
an
application
of
the
rule
56(f),
we
had
to
make
our
application
under
rule
56
(f).
mr.
william
e.
kelly
that's
a
supporting
affidavit
to
a
motion,
that
submits
this
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
am
reading
from
it,
“and
submits
this
affidavit
pursuant
to
rule
56(f)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
in
opposition
to
the
defendant's
cities
service
motion
for
summary
judgment,”
the
very
first
affidavit
submitted
on
this
proceeding.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
a
whole
series
of
other
peoples'
depositions
as
well.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
where
is
it
in
the
record,
we
have
a
page
reference
to
it
in
our
briefs.
it's
not
in
the
printed
portion
of
the
record,
not
as
such
we
just
have
the
opinions,
but
what
i
just
read
when
we
were
arguing
this
point
before
judge
herlands
is
in
the
printed
record,
volume
iii,
page
118,
the
first
argument
may
9,
1960,
“the
place
to
begin
is
with
w.
alton
jones.”
we
made
the
point
early.
we
made
it
often.
we
asked
for
general
discovery
on
four
separate
occasions.
now
my
opponent
has
made
the
point.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
the
first
one
in
may
in
december
of
1958
when
the
motion,
when
the
deposition
of
plaintiff
had
gone
on
for
some
66
occasions,
we
came
in
and
said
allow
us
to
terminate
our
deposition
and
to
go
forward
with
the
depositions
of
the
plaintiff.
that
was
before
any
summary
judgment
motion
had
been
made
at
all
at
that
point.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
1958
we
asked
for
the
termination
of
the
plaintiff's
deposition,
the
filing
of
answers
and
to
allow
us
to
go
forward
and
conduct
our
own
general
discovery.
now--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
in
connection
with
rule
56(f)
our
position
is
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
say
it
is,
and
i
was
coming
to
that
point
your
honor.
when
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
made
on
the
merits,
rule
56(f)'s
discovery
is
coterminous
with
general
discovery
under
the
earlier
sections
of
the
rule,
it
has
to
be,
there
is
no
limit.
now,
there
maybe
occasions
where
somebody
moves
for
summary
judgment
on
the
special
provision,
a
release
or
something
of
that
sort,
that
of
necessity,
a
rule
56
discovery
need
not
to
as
extensive
as
the
general
discovery
provisions.
but
where
as
in
the
present
case,
cities
moves
to
summary
judgment
on
the
merits
we
say
rule
56(f)
gives
us
the
right
to
general
discovery
of
the
entire
issues
of
the
case.
now
the
next
point
is
throughout
we've
had
one
theory.
we
have
never
changed
theories.
we
have
never
abandoned
theories
from
the
very
first
we
have
said,
we
have
an
antitrust
conspiracy
case.
we
preserved
our
position
throughout.
we
have
never
abandoned
anything.
the
problem
is
throughout
this
matter
the
evidence
rests
in
the
hands
of
the
defendants,
where
else
are
we
going
to
get
this
evidence?
we
know
a
little
bit
here,
a
little
bit
there,
pieces
of
evidence
here
and
there,
but
we
cannot
know
all
the
details
of
this
conspiracy
and
it
is
this
point
that
i
think
is
essential
to
this
court.
one
reference
to
a
case,
the
paula
(ph)
case,
i
am
sorry--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
oh,
i
am
sorry.
thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
hope
i'd
get
the
permission
--
i
hope
i
would
get
the
opportunity
to
conduct
discovery
of
all
the
defendants
in
the
case
before
motions
come
on.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes,
we
haven't
had,
we
have
not
had
general
discovery
of
cities
service,
we
haven't
had
the
opportunity
to
develop
this
on
the
record.
the
first
person
we
got
was
hill.
hill
was
a
technician,
an
attorney.
he
knew
nothing,
he
knew
nothing
of
iranian
venture.
he
knew
nothing
about
jones'
activities.
we
then
were
given
after
another
application
limited
discovery
of
three
surviving
cities
personnel,
watson,
heston
and
fran.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no,
we
wanted
them
of
course,
but
we
wanted
jones
long
before
he
died,
these
were
the
survivors
that
we
were
given
the
right
to
examine
and
under
the
most
restrictive
discovery
order
i've
ever
seen
in
the
district
court
anywhere,
it's
set
forth
in
the
provisions
of
our
brief.
it
has
time
limitations.
we
weren't
even
permitted
to
inquire
into
the
api
convention
where
these
threats
were
made.
the
time
limit
was
november
1
in
the
order
of
the
district
court.
this
occurred
on
november
7.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
we
can
obtain
complete
discovery
of
cities
files
to
find
out
what
jones
did
when
he
went
to
kuwait.
what
jones
said
in
response
to
the
threats
at
the
api
convention?
what
jones
said
to
sandberg
when
he
went
to
holland?
we
can
obtain
it
from
all
sources
including
the
defendant's
files.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
jones
was
apparently
an
individual
who
kept
things
to
himself,
that's
right.
now
what
we
find
out
from
the
record
i
don't
know,
but
the
point
is
cities
service
having
withheld
jones
from
the
very
outset,
and
he
never
submitted
his
motion,
his
death
should
not
be
visited
on
us.
we
should
have
the
opportunity
to
find
this
information,
these
facts,
anywhere
we
can
find
them
under
the
limits
of
general
discovery,
by
withholding
jones
his
affidavit
at
the
outset,
denying
our
motion
to
get
jones'
testimony
three
years
before
he
died,
we
never
had
the
opportunity
to
get
what
we
have
should
have
gotten.
now
cities
should
not
be
permitted
to
obtain
summary
judgment
simply
because
it's
going
to
be
hard
or
difficult
for
us
to
find
this
evidence.
i
can
see
it
will
be
hard
and
difficult,
we'll
take
that
chance,
we'd
like
to
have
that
opportunity.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes,
i
was
coming
to
paula
case,
i
think
paula
case
makes
it
quite
clear
that
summary
judgment
i
think
all
of
the
bench
was
in
agreement
on
this
point
that
you
can't
decide
complex
summary
antitrust
cases
until
everybody
has
an
adequate
discovery.
the
dissenting
opinion,
assumes
and
says
at
three
or
four
different
place,
a
plaintiff
has
had
discovery
of
all
the
people
he
needs
in
this
particular
situation
and
it
was
a
split
in
the
opinion
on
the
facts
of
the
case
whether
it
was
or
wasn't
appropriate
for
summary
judgment,
but
in
that
case
it
was
assumed,
as
it
is
in
almost
any
case
that
i've
ever
seen
that
there
ought
to
be
complete
discovery
by
the
plaintiff
under
the
rules
before
you
bring
on
a
summary
judgment
motion.
we've
asked
for
that,
we
asked
for
a
five,
six
seven
times
denied
all
the
time.
we've
given
restricted
discovery
of
people
that
we
would
take
in
due
course,
but
not
the
people
we
wanted
throughout
this
point,
throughout
the
litigation.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes
mr.
justice
white
my
associate
hands
me
a
record
reference
to
mr.
lane's
affidavit
in
1960
it's
in
the
record
of
page
11449.
now
coming
back
to
where
we
got
started
on
this
point
i
have
a
moment
or
two,
the
first
opinion
in
this
case
indicates
the
district
court's
attitude
towards
our
case.
at
the
very
outset
before
we
had
any
discovery
at
all,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
made
and
this
opinion
is
rendered.
the
opinion
is
the
opinion
that
put
us
upon
this
course
of
narrow
limited
tortuous
discovery.
that
makes
the
point
in
complete
contrast
you
read
this
opinion
paragraph
5
of
it,
with
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
hickman
v.
taylor
and
you
wonder
they
just
don't
square.
there
is
no
attempt,
extensive
discovery
is
not
to
be
given.
“such
proceedings
will
be
closely
regulated.
adjust
and
workable
balance
will
be
maintained
between
the
parties.
the
usual
federal
rule
permitting
fishing
expeditions
will
be
curtailed.”
now
we
are
not
on
any
fishing
expedition
here.
we
simply
wanted
general
discovery
under
the
rules
of
the
people
we
wanted.
we
didn't
want
them
selected
by
the
defendant
as
they
were.
we
didn't
want
the
witnesses
who
subsequently
died
throughout
these
proceeding
suppressed
from
us
and
kept
from
us,
we
wanted
a
general
discovery
and
we've
never,
never
had
it
in
the
entire
time
throughout
this
litigation.
thank
you
i
am
sorry
i
don't
have
more
time.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
patricia
waldron
the
executrix
of
the
estate
of
her
late
husband
gerald
b.
waldron,
who
is
the
original
plaintiff
in
this
action.
for
the
purposes
of
simplicity
the
parties
on
this
appeal
continue
to
refer
to
mr.
waldron
as
the
petitioner
or
the
plaintiff.
a
word
of
background;
in
1951
iran
nationalized
its
oil
resources.
up
until
this
time
and
for
many
years
the
anglo-iranian
oil
company,
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
action,
now
known
as
british
petroleum
had
operated
the
iranian
oil
industry
under
a
long
term
concession.
the
act
of
nationalization
in
effect
kicked
the
british
out.
the
british
retaliated
and
in
this
case
when
i
refer
to
the
british,
i
refer
to
the
british
government
as
well
because
british
petroleum
is
51%
owned
by
the
british
government,
retaliated
by
a
boycott
on
iranian
oil.
the
other
defendants
in
this
action
who
are
the
international
major
oil
companies
respected
this
boycott
with
the
result
that
the
iranians
from
the
spring
of
1951,
indeed
throughout
the
entire
period
of
time
we
refer
to
were
unable
to
sell
any
oil
in
the
world
markets.
in
1952
plaintiff
who
conceitedly
did
not
have
any
experience
in
the
oil
business
up
to
that
time
nonetheless
obtained
a
contract
from
the
iranian
government
allowing
him
to
purchase
an
enormous
amount
of
oil,
50
million
metric
tons
of
oil
at
significant
discounts
below
the
posted
persian
gulf
prices.
thereafter
he
attempted
to
sell
this
oil
in
the
united
states
approaching
over
50
independent
oil
companies
and
he
was
unable
to
sell
a
single
drop
of
that
oil.
one
of
the
companies
he
approached
was
the
respondent
cities
service
and
it
is
that
particular
aspect
of
the
case
that
is
before
the
court
today.
his
contract
expired
in
the
summer,
1953.
the
action
itself
was
commenced
on
june
11,
1956.
it
is
of
course
an
action,
treble
damage
anti-trust
action,
a
private
antitrust
action.
almost
immediately
the
defendants
claiming
one
case
at
least
that
they
never
heard
of
plaintiff
obtained
a
stay
of
plaintiff’s
discovery
in
order
to
permit
them
to
depose
him
and
to
frame
answers
in
response
to
the
complaint.
that
stay
which
was
obtained
in
early
july
1956
has
been
enforced
throughout
the
entire
ligation,
11
years.
it
in
enforced
today
but
plaintiff
has
been
under
that
state
for
the
entire
period
of
this
litigation.
he
has
had
no
opportunity
to
conduct
any
general
discovery
whatever.
in
1960
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
the
stay
itself
was
obtained
i
believe
it
was
july
3,
1956,
an
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
stay
of
any
discovery
on
his
part,
preventing
him
from
taking
any
general
discovery.
i
will
return
to
this
point
in
a
moment
your
honor.
i
just
want
to
lay
out
the
overall
action
and
the
appeal.
in
1960
while
the
plaintiff
was
still
under
this
stay
and
after
the
plaintiff
had
been
deposed
cities
moved
for
summary
judgment.
this
motion
was
adjourned
several
times
to
allow
plaintiff
to
conduct
limited
discovery
of
cities
service.
the
motion
was
finally
granted
in
1965.
appeal
followed
to
the
circuit
court
and
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court.
we
make
three
points
on
this
appeal.
first
of
all
that
it
was
error
for
the
district
court
to
limit
plaintiff's
discovery
throughout
the
entire
course
of
this
litigation
and
particularly
when
he
was
forced
to
oppose
a
summary
judgment
by
cities
service,
that
is
point
one
of
our
brief.
point
two
of
our
brief
is
that
in
opposing
this
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
burden
of
showing
treble
issues
of
the
fact
was
placed
on
the
plaintiff.
it
should
have
been
placed
on
the
defendant,
who
in
his
papers
utterly
failed
to
negate
the
allegations
of
conspiracy
and
it
is
that
we
claim
as
the
second
error,
that
is
point
two
of
our
brief.
point
three
of
our
brief
is
even
on
the
limited
facts
that
we
have
been
able
to
gather
in
the
course
of
the
11
years,
we
nonetheless
believe
we
make
out
a
case
for
the
jury
on
the
conspiracy
issue
against
all
defendants.
now
let
me
go
back
and
give
some
of
the
background
facts.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes
the
plaintiff
was
boycotted
completely
from
selling
his
oil
that
he
had
under
this
contract
in
the
united
states
and
i'll
develop
that
point,
i
am
just
coming
to
that
point
factually
right
now.
time
will
not
permit
us
to
discuss
all
of
the
incidents,
but
there
are
two
that
i
think
bear
reputation.
as
i
said
before
when
he
obtained
this
contract
in
may
of
1952,
plaintiff
immediately
got
together
with
a
number
of
other
people,
4
or
5
in
number
and
approached
over
50
independent
american
oil
companies
and
asked
them,
would
they
be
interested
in
purchasing
oil
that
he
had
under
the
contract
from
the
iranian
government.
universally
without
exception,
all
refused
to
deal
with
him
when
they
heard
where
the
oil
was
was
coming
from.
in
good
deal
we've
citied
in
our
four
or
five
specific
examples
one
went
even
so
far
of
putting
a
letter
saying
that
the
threat
of
retaliation
by
the
majors
is
too
great.
now
one
of
the
background
facts
is
important.
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
and
i
am
sure
it
probably
understands
it
anyways
that
99%
of
the
world's
oil
production
is
under
the
control
of
the
six
or
seven
defendants
in
this
action.
the
international
major
oil
companies,
all
other
independent
oil
companies
have
to
purchase
their
oil
from
these
defendants.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
all
of
the
defendants,
oh
yes,
except
one
gulf,
there
has
been
a
settlement,
gulf
has
dropped
out
of
the
case,
it's
now
in
the
position
of
a
co-conspirator.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no,
just
cities,
who
have
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
1960
and
just
that
branch
of
the
case
is
now
before
the
court.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
it
waits.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
just
against
cities
for
the
moment.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
cities
in
the
facts
that
i'm
beginning
to
state
aren't
disputed
by
cities,
i
am
coming
to
the
peculiar
role
of
cities
in
this
particular
matter
in
a
moment
otherwise
the
overall
conspiracy
is
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
this
motion
and
then
we
have
to
deal
with
cities
as
a
particular
exception
i
began
to
point
that
out
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
i
think
i
had
just
reached
the
point
where
i
said
that
none
of
the
independent
oil
companies
would
even
take
this
oil
because
they
were
afraid
of
losing
the
supply
that
they
would
obtain
from
the
major
oil
companies.
one
particular
example
of
how
the
cartel,
if
you
would
please,
touched
the
plaintiff
was
in
the
spring
of
1952,
plaintiff
was
required
to
obtain
a
letter
of
credit
under
his
contract
to
purchase
oil
from
the
iranian
government.
he
went
to
the
chase
national
bank
now
known
as
the
chase
manhattan
bank.
he
was
on
the
verge
of
receiving
a
letter
of
credit
when
a
telephone
call
came
into
the
branch
manager
telling
him
we
can't
do
it.
chase
is
unable
to
do
it
because
it
has
preferred
customers
in
the
oil
business.
branch
manager
very
excited
and
went
downtown
met
the
chase
vice
president
and
this
chase
vice
president
told
him
that
one
of
the
preferred
depositors
or
customers
of
the
chase
bank
was
a
major
oil
company,
the
gulf
oil
company.
colonel
drake
had
issued
instructions,
colonel
drake
being
the
chairman
of
the
board
not
to
give
plaintiff
a
letter
of
credit.
this
is
the
way,
this
is
the
background
fact,
i
don't
think
it's
too
important
but
it
gives
you
an
example
i
think
of
how
this
thing
works.
now
coming
to
cities;
cities
was
not
a
major
international
oil
company
in
1952.
it
was
a
deficit
oil
company.
it
had
to
purchase
oil
from
the
majors.
it
had
purchase
one
half
of
its
daily
requirement
from
the
majors.
one
of
plaintiff's
associates
had
been
a
former
employee
of
cities
service.
he
suggested
that
they
go
to
cities
service
to
see
if
they
would
be
interested
in
plaintiff's
contract
to
purchase
iranian
oil.
they
went
into
see
plaintiff
--
they
went
into
cities,
and
cities
was
vitally
interested
in
this.
there
was
meeting
between
plaintiff's
associates
and
several
of
this
cities
executive
officers.
plaintiff
was
asked,
could
he
go
to
iran
where
he
had
been
to
obtain
this
contract
originally
where
he
met
the
high
officials
of
the
iranian
government
including
premier
mossadegh,
could
you
obtain
an
invitation
to
w.
alton
jones,
the
president
of
cities
service
inviting
mr.
jones
to
iran?
he
said
he
could,
he'd
try
it,
went
back
to
iran,
obtained
the
invitation,
brought
it
back
and
delivered
it
to
the
cities
service's
officers.
jones
was
delighted
at
this
point.
immediately,
he
moved
the
cities
service
executive
personnel
to
see
what
could
be
developed
with
this
opportunity.
a
working
party
was
formed
consisting
of
three
experts
in
the
production,
refining
and
distribution
areas
and
they
together
with
jones
and
plaintiff
and
plaintiff's
associates
left
for
iran
where
there
was
a
three
or
four
week
inspection
of
the
iranian
oil
facilities.
one
of
the
things
that
was
prepared
by
one
of
the
executives
of
cities
service
was
a
draft
report,
a
secret
report
laying
out
how
cities
could
use
this
opportunity
to
ensure
a
long-term
supply
of
oil
and
they
made
no
bones
about
it
this
time,
this
was
a
tremendous
opportunity
for
them
at
this
point.
they
went
to
iran.
now
this
received
a
considerable
amount
of
publicity
back
in
1952.
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
remembers
it
or
not,
i
vaguely
do
myself.
when
they
got
to
iran
there
were
rumors
of
this,
that
the
plant,
the
abadan
refinery
had
been
sabotaged.
they
went
around
and
they
looked
at
it.
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
inspection
tour
and
they
found
that
everything
was
all
right,
there
was
no
particular
problems
at
all.
the
opportunity
was
there,
there
were
no
obstacles
in
the
way.
they
met
with
premier
mossadegh.
jones
had
an
oral
conversation
with
him,
outlined
his
findings,
promised
to
give
mossadegh
a
written
report
upon
on
his
return
to
the
united
states,
and
with
this
they
came
back
to
the
united
states.
now
there's
one
incident
that
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
kuwait
oil
is
in
this
case
and
we
will
hear
a
little
bit
about
it
later.
kuwait
is
a
concession,
kuwait
concession
is
operated,
it's
little
bit
below
iran
on
the
persian
gulf
is
operated
by
british
petroleum
and
gulf
jointly.
in
the
middle
of
these
negotiations
in
iran,
unknown
to
plaintiff,
jones
secretly
went
down
to
kuwait.
what
happened
there,
we
don't
know,
we
don't
have
any
idea.
in
1960,
this
is
very
important
because
it
was
expressly
denied
by
cities
that
jones
had
gone
to
kuwait,
the
very
time
this
motion
was
made,
i'll
comeback
and
explain
the
significance
of
that
in
a
moment
because
jones'
affidavit
was
never,
never
submitted
on
the
summary
judgment
motion
that
is
this
that
what
we
say,
this
is
manner
we
say
that
cities
never
negated
the
conspiracy
in
this
case,
the
allegations
of
conspiracy.
jones
returned
to
the
united
states.
on
the
way
to
and
from
the
united
states,
he
met
with
the
gentleman
named
sandberg
in
holland.
now,
we
don't
know
sabdberg's
role
in
this
case
either
except
watson,
cities
executive
vice
president
believed
him
to
have
a
connection
with
royal
dutch
shell
one
of
the
co-conspirators
in
this
case.
we
don't
know
whether
he
has
that
connection
or
not,
an
affidavit
has
been
submitted
by
mr.
sandberg
in
which
he
denies
any
such
connection.
what
is
known
is
that
sandberg
is
the
head
of
one
of
the
leading
private
banking
houses
in
holland,
pierson
&
heldering.
the
affidavit
that's
submitted
by
sandberg
doesn't
say
what
jones
discussed
for
five
days
on
his
way
to
iran
or
in
the
trip
back.
again,
we
say
this
is
most
significant,
we
don't
know
what
occurred.
the
promised
report
to
mossadegh
was
prepared
by
cities
personnel.
however,
at
this
time
there
began
to
be
an
outcry
against
cities
activities
in
iran.
the
american
petroleum
institute
convention
in
november
1957,
excuse
me,
not
1957,
1952,
jones
went
to
that
convention
bearing
in
mind
that
he's
a
deficit
oil
company.
we
have
in
the
record
what
occurred
an
admission
by
one
of
the
cities'
personnel
to
plaintiff
and
the
quote
is
in
the
record.
“boys,
we
really
got
into
hot
water
over
this
one.
the
big
boys
said
that
they
wish
jones
well
in
his
iranian
oil
venture
and
hoped
he
get
a
lot
of
oil
and
hoped
that
he
got
it
right
away,
because
he
wasn't
going
to
get
any
more
from
them.”
now,
at
this
point
jones
immediately
change
his
direction,
no
longer
is
he
interested
in
plaintiffs
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
well,
that's
a
quote
in
the
deposition.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
of
the
plaintiff
your
honor,
at
page
4034
of
the
plaintiff's
deposition
which
is
some
6000
pages
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no,
it
was
the
statement
by
plaintiff,
two
plaintiffs
by
one
of
the
cities
executive
officers,
a
fellow
named
wetzel
(ph).
mr.
william
e.
kelly
he
died
before
we
ever
to
got
a
chance
to
take
his
deposition
that's
one
of
the
points
we
make
throughout
this
case.
four
or
five
people
have
died
cities'
officers
that
we
have
never
been
able
to
depose,
including
jones,
i'll
come
to
that.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
can't
hear
you.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
my
client's
testimony
occurred
before
mr.
wetzel's
death.
mr.
wetzel
died
in
january
of
1960
as
i
recall.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
well
i
think
cities
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
think
the
point
is
your
honor
when
i
come
to
this
your
honor
and
this
motion
cities
concedes
all
these
facts
except
one
thing
and
that
is
that
sandberg
incident
that
i
just
referred
to,
none
of
these
are
disputed.
after
jones
returned
to
the
united
states
and
after
these
threats,
changed
direction
immediately
and
at
this
point
plaintiff
entree
to
iran
were
dropped.
jones
immediately
began
to
follow-up
another
deal
that
had
been
pending
with
kuwait
oil,
with
gulf
for
the
purchase
of
kuwait
oil.
this
contract
was
finally
executed
in
january
1953,
i'll
come
to
that
again
in
a
moment.
at
the
same
time
jones
began
to
take
the
position
that
the
only
honorable
solution
to
the
iranian
situation
was
to
compromise
with
the
british
and
he
wrote
such
a
letter
to
incoming
secretary
of
state,
dulles
and
incoming
secretary
of
state
brownell
(ph),
he
had
kept
the
united
states
government
informed
what
his
activities
were
during
his
period
going
down
to
washington,
meeting
with
president
truman
before
he
went
to
iran.
now
the
focus
was
entirely
different.
now
it
was
compromised
with
the
british
government,
compromise
with
british
petroleum.
the
promised
report
to
mossadegh
which
we
have
is
an
exhibit
in
this
record
was
never
sent,
it
was
never
sent,
although
we
don't
know
why
because
there
was
one
very
significant
recommendation
in
that
report,
two
recommendations.
one
significant
recommendation
was
that
the
iranians
like
the
mexicans
in
1938
could
begin
to
develop
their
own
oil
markets
that
would
take
them
much,
much
longer
but
there
was
no
obstacles
to
that
approach.
this
report
was
never
sent
so
far
as
we
know.
plaintiff's
contract
expired
in
june
of
1963
as
i
indicated
before
without
him
selling
any
oil
whatsoever.
the
action
was
brought
in
1956.
the
stay
of
discovery
immediately
imposed
and
plaintiff's
depositions
begin
some
60
some,
some
62
or
63
deposition
sessions
were
held
between
1956
and
the
end
of
1958
at
which
time
the
plaintiff
moved
in
the
district
court
for
an
order
terminating
his
deposition
compelling
the
defendants
to
answer.
they
now
knew
enough
about
plaintiff
to
surely
submit
answers
to
the
complaint.
a
motion
was
assigned
and
came
on
to
be
heard
regularly,
the
regular
course
of
the
motion
by
judge
herlands
who
later
was
assigned
to
the
case
for
all
purposes.
judge
herlands
not
denied
the
motion,
but
he
then
increased
the
term
of
the
stay
upon
plaintiff
by
now
giving
defendants,
although
they
hadn't
ask
for
it
at
all,
the
opportunity
to
depose
all
of
plaintiff's
associates
and
send
a
schedule
of
a
174
days
to
complete
the
deposition,
the
cumulative
depositions
of
plaintiff's
associates
and
in
addition
asked
everybody
how
many
more
days
they
needed
to
depose
the
plaintiff.
i
think
the
total
came
to
60
some
odd
sessions.
now
the
entire
schedule
was
filled.
plaintiff
was
in
fact
only
deposed
for
30
some
odd
sessions
more.
the
witnesses'
depositions
i
believe
consumed
some
50
to
60
days,
60
deposition
days.
in
any
event,
the
plaintiff's
deposition
ended
finally
in
i
believe
it
was
january
or
february
of
1960.
cities
immediately
moved
for
summary
judgment.
plaintiff
is
still
under
the
stay
that
i
referred
to.
the
motion
is
an
interesting
one
because
cities
took
the
position
at
this
time
that
since
plaintiff
had
admitted
in
his
testimony,
that
the
two
items,
that
he
saw
in
the
newspapers
in
1954
and
which
caused
him
to
think,
he
had
particularly
no
idea
about
this
before,
an
announcement
of
the
purchase
of
oil
by
cities
from
gulf,
which
had
begun
in
1952,
and
the
fact
that
the
cities
had
gone
into
the
iranian
consortium,
which
was
the
ultimate
solution
to
the
case,
the
ultimate
solution
of
the
iranian
situation.
these
two
events
are
what
caused
the
cities,
they
were
reason
that
caused
plaintiff,
they
were
the
reasons
why
plaintiff
brought
this
action.
cities
therefore
focused
just
on
these
two
issues
in
attempt
to
disprove
them
as
if
they
were
essential
question
in
the
case.
a
motion
came
on
to
be
heard.
mr.
hill's
affidavit
was
the
only
affidavit
submitted
by
cities.
he
was
an
attorney
working
with
cities
and
had
been
the
chief
negotiator
on
the
contract
with
gulf
and
in
connection
with
cities'
opportunities
to
participate
in
the
consortium
situation.
jones'
affidavit
was
never
submitted.
the
motion
came
on.
we
argued
that
it
should
be
denied
because
it
was
impossibly
premature.
we
couldn't
begin
to
oppose
it.
we
haven't
had
deposition
of
jones,
a
key
figure.
we
have
pointed
out
previously
in
1958
that
we
were
losing
time
that
we
ought
to
be
permitted
to
examine
these
witnesses.
we
listed
a
whole
series
of
people
we
wished
to
depose
in
opposition
to
the
motion.
instead,
we
were
told
to
oppose
the
motion
on
the
merits,
and
we
attempted
to
do
so,
emphasizing
however
that
we
wanted
discovery
throughout.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
there
was
a
rule
of
priority
when
the
case
came
on
in
1956.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
if
the
defendants
served
their
notices
first,
they
had
priority
to
complete
the
deposition.
that
rule
has
since
been
changed.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
that's
right.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
it
was
a
rule
that
would
be
considered
to
apply.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
wouldn't
say
so,
but
it's
a
case
on
itself
because
it's
a
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes,
yes
there
was
a
rule
in
effect
it
since
has
been
changed
and
now
there
is
no
priority
as
such
there
can
be
concurrent
discovery,
which
is
of
course
what
we
are
asking
for.
it
wasn't
so
much
that
we
were
protesting
against
our
deposition
be
taking,
which
i
didn't,
but
we
wanted
to
take
the
deposition
of
the
defendants.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
none
as
such,
except
what
i
am
coming
to
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
we
were
giving,
we
were
given
the
right
to
depose
hill
immediately
after
the
conclusion
of
this
first
hearing
on
summary
judgment.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
we
haven't
had
any
to
this
day
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
none.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
now
we
are
coming
to
the
discovery,
the
limited
discovery
we
had
in
connection
with
the
cities
service
motion,
and
of
course
we
asked
that
we
should
have
general
discovery
of
all
defendants,
because
evidence
of
this
conspiracy
could
be
anywhere
on
the
defendants'
files.
we
were
given
the
deposition
of
hill
despite
the
fact
that
we
wanted
jones.
jones'
affidavit
had
been
withheld.
our
position
was
we
had
dealt
with
jones,
we
didn't
know
hill.
i
don't
think
the
plaintiff
had
even
met
hill
except
possibly
once
casually
while
he
was
at
cities
service.
this
deposition
was
taken
and
completed.
it
revealed
very
little
because
hill
didn't
know
anything
to
speak
of.
he
knew
about
the
details
of
the
contract
and
then
in
one
significant
case,
he
didn't
even
know
that
there
had
been
a
most
favored
nation's
letter
obtained
by
direct
dealing
between
jones
and
drake
of
cities
service.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
reply.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
thank
you,
your
honor.
my
opponent
made
the
point
that
we
didn't
ask
for
jones.
i
read
from
the
affidavits
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
1961,
the
motion
first
came
on,
at
this
point
plaintiff
cannot
name
all
the
witnesses
that
would
have
to
be
examined
concerning
the
above
transactions,
but
again
for
the
court's
convenience,
plaintiff
can
list
those
within
the
top
management
with
whom
he
dealt
and
logically
should
have
the
answers,
they
are
as
follows,
the
first
one
w.
alton
jones,
president
and
director
of
cities
service,
the
man
for
whom
the
invitation
was
obtained
from
premier
mossadegh
and
who
headed
the
team
that
went
to
iran.
at
the
oral
argument
of
the
motion,
my
late
partner
said,
“i
think
the
obvious
place
to
begin
is
with
cities
service
with
the
personnel
with
whom
all
these
dealings
were
had,”
and
then
skipping
down
on
page
118
of
volume
iii,
“the
place
to
begin
is
with
w.
alton
jones,”
that
is
in
may
of
1960,
three
years
before
jones
died.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
we
were
under
a
stay,
your
honor,
this
was
the
proceeding
which
we
asked,
give
us
jones.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
a
stay,
we
couldn't
serve
anything.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no,
this
was
an
application
of
the
rule
56(f),
we
had
to
make
our
application
under
rule
56
(f).
mr.
william
e.
kelly
that's
a
supporting
affidavit
to
a
motion,
that
submits
this
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
am
reading
from
it,
“and
submits
this
affidavit
pursuant
to
rule
56(f)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
in
opposition
to
the
defendant's
cities
service
motion
for
summary
judgment,”
the
very
first
affidavit
submitted
on
this
proceeding.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
a
whole
series
of
other
peoples'
depositions
as
well.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
where
is
it
in
the
record,
we
have
a
page
reference
to
it
in
our
briefs.
it's
not
in
the
printed
portion
of
the
record,
not
as
such
we
just
have
the
opinions,
but
what
i
just
read
when
we
were
arguing
this
point
before
judge
herlands
is
in
the
printed
record,
volume
iii,
page
118,
the
first
argument
may
9,
1960,
“the
place
to
begin
is
with
w.
alton
jones.”
we
made
the
point
early.
we
made
it
often.
we
asked
for
general
discovery
on
four
separate
occasions.
now
my
opponent
has
made
the
point.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
the
first
one
in
may
in
december
of
1958
when
the
motion,
when
the
deposition
of
plaintiff
had
gone
on
for
some
66
occasions,
we
came
in
and
said
allow
us
to
terminate
our
deposition
and
to
go
forward
with
the
depositions
of
the
plaintiff.
that
was
before
any
summary
judgment
motion
had
been
made
at
all
at
that
point.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
1958
we
asked
for
the
termination
of
the
plaintiff's
deposition,
the
filing
of
answers
and
to
allow
us
to
go
forward
and
conduct
our
own
general
discovery.
now--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
in
connection
with
rule
56(f)
our
position
is
--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
say
it
is,
and
i
was
coming
to
that
point
your
honor.
when
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
made
on
the
merits,
rule
56(f)'s
discovery
is
coterminous
with
general
discovery
under
the
earlier
sections
of
the
rule,
it
has
to
be,
there
is
no
limit.
now,
there
maybe
occasions
where
somebody
moves
for
summary
judgment
on
the
special
provision,
a
release
or
something
of
that
sort,
that
of
necessity,
a
rule
56
discovery
need
not
to
as
extensive
as
the
general
discovery
provisions.
but
where
as
in
the
present
case,
cities
moves
to
summary
judgment
on
the
merits
we
say
rule
56(f)
gives
us
the
right
to
general
discovery
of
the
entire
issues
of
the
case.
now
the
next
point
is
throughout
we've
had
one
theory.
we
have
never
changed
theories.
we
have
never
abandoned
theories
from
the
very
first
we
have
said,
we
have
an
antitrust
conspiracy
case.
we
preserved
our
position
throughout.
we
have
never
abandoned
anything.
the
problem
is
throughout
this
matter
the
evidence
rests
in
the
hands
of
the
defendants,
where
else
are
we
going
to
get
this
evidence?
we
know
a
little
bit
here,
a
little
bit
there,
pieces
of
evidence
here
and
there,
but
we
cannot
know
all
the
details
of
this
conspiracy
and
it
is
this
point
that
i
think
is
essential
to
this
court.
one
reference
to
a
case,
the
paula
(ph)
case,
i
am
sorry--
mr.
william
e.
kelly
oh,
i
am
sorry.
thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
i
hope
i'd
get
the
permission
--
i
hope
i
would
get
the
opportunity
to
conduct
discovery
of
all
the
defendants
in
the
case
before
motions
come
on.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes,
we
haven't
had,
we
have
not
had
general
discovery
of
cities
service,
we
haven't
had
the
opportunity
to
develop
this
on
the
record.
the
first
person
we
got
was
hill.
hill
was
a
technician,
an
attorney.
he
knew
nothing,
he
knew
nothing
of
iranian
venture.
he
knew
nothing
about
jones'
activities.
we
then
were
given
after
another
application
limited
discovery
of
three
surviving
cities
personnel,
watson,
heston
and
fran.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
no,
we
wanted
them
of
course,
but
we
wanted
jones
long
before
he
died,
these
were
the
survivors
that
we
were
given
the
right
to
examine
and
under
the
most
restrictive
discovery
order
i've
ever
seen
in
the
district
court
anywhere,
it's
set
forth
in
the
provisions
of
our
brief.
it
has
time
limitations.
we
weren't
even
permitted
to
inquire
into
the
api
convention
where
these
threats
were
made.
the
time
limit
was
november
1
in
the
order
of
the
district
court.
this
occurred
on
november
7.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
we
can
obtain
complete
discovery
of
cities
files
to
find
out
what
jones
did
when
he
went
to
kuwait.
what
jones
said
in
response
to
the
threats
at
the
api
convention?
what
jones
said
to
sandberg
when
he
went
to
holland?
we
can
obtain
it
from
all
sources
including
the
defendant's
files.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
jones
was
apparently
an
individual
who
kept
things
to
himself,
that's
right.
now
what
we
find
out
from
the
record
i
don't
know,
but
the
point
is
cities
service
having
withheld
jones
from
the
very
outset,
and
he
never
submitted
his
motion,
his
death
should
not
be
visited
on
us.
we
should
have
the
opportunity
to
find
this
information,
these
facts,
anywhere
we
can
find
them
under
the
limits
of
general
discovery,
by
withholding
jones
his
affidavit
at
the
outset,
denying
our
motion
to
get
jones'
testimony
three
years
before
he
died,
we
never
had
the
opportunity
to
get
what
we
have
should
have
gotten.
now
cities
should
not
be
permitted
to
obtain
summary
judgment
simply
because
it's
going
to
be
hard
or
difficult
for
us
to
find
this
evidence.
i
can
see
it
will
be
hard
and
difficult,
we'll
take
that
chance,
we'd
like
to
have
that
opportunity.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes,
i
was
coming
to
paula
case,
i
think
paula
case
makes
it
quite
clear
that
summary
judgment
i
think
all
of
the
bench
was
in
agreement
on
this
point
that
you
can't
decide
complex
summary
antitrust
cases
until
everybody
has
an
adequate
discovery.
the
dissenting
opinion,
assumes
and
says
at
three
or
four
different
place,
a
plaintiff
has
had
discovery
of
all
the
people
he
needs
in
this
particular
situation
and
it
was
a
split
in
the
opinion
on
the
facts
of
the
case
whether
it
was
or
wasn't
appropriate
for
summary
judgment,
but
in
that
case
it
was
assumed,
as
it
is
in
almost
any
case
that
i've
ever
seen
that
there
ought
to
be
complete
discovery
by
the
plaintiff
under
the
rules
before
you
bring
on
a
summary
judgment
motion.
we've
asked
for
that,
we
asked
for
a
five,
six
seven
times
denied
all
the
time.
we've
given
restricted
discovery
of
people
that
we
would
take
in
due
course,
but
not
the
people
we
wanted
throughout
this
point,
throughout
the
litigation.
mr.
william
e.
kelly
yes
mr.
justice
white
my
associate
hands
me
a
record
reference
to
mr.
lane's
affidavit
in
1960
it's
in
the
record
of
page
11449.
now
coming
back
to
where
we
got
started
on
this
point
i
have
a
moment
or
two,
the
first
opinion
in
this
case
indicates
the
district
court's
attitude
towards
our
case.
at
the
very
outset
before
we
had
any
discovery
at
all,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
made
and
this
opinion
is
rendered.
the
opinion
is
the
opinion
that
put
us
upon
this
course
of
narrow
limited
tortuous
discovery.
that
makes
the
point
in
complete
contrast
you
read
this
opinion
paragraph
5
of
it,
with
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
hickman
v.
taylor
and
you
wonder
they
just
don't
square.
there
is
no
attempt,
extensive
discovery
is
not
to
be
given.
“such
proceedings
will
be
closely
regulated.
adjust
and
workable
balance
will
be
maintained
between
the
parties.
the
usual
federal
rule
permitting
fishing
expeditions
will
be
curtailed.”
now
we
are
not
on
any
fishing
expedition
here.
we
simply
wanted
general
discovery
under
the
rules
of
the
people
we
wanted.
we
didn't
want
them
selected
by
the
defendant
as
they
were.
we
didn't
want
the
witnesses
who
subsequently
died
throughout
these
proceeding
suppressed
from
us
and
kept
from
us,
we
wanted
a
general
discovery
and
we've
never,
never
had
it
in
the
entire
time
throughout
this
litigation.
thank
you
i
am
sorry
i
don't
have
more
time.
