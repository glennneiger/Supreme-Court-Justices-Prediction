mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
that
i've
just
heard
argued
is
somewhat
different
from
the
case
to
which
i
have
spent
about
11
years
of
my
life.
the
plaintiff
had
been
represented
until
this
argument
by
the
late
mr.
samuel
lane,
who
is
a
very
able,
very
resourceful
lawyer,
in
addition
if
i
maybe
allowed
to
say
a
very
gallant
gentleman.
he
has
been
lost
at
sea
and
on
one
have
seen
him
for
sometime,
i
assume
his
death
is
now
presumed.
so
i
shall
assume
that
those
departures
from
what
happened
from
the
story
of
this
case
to
which
my
learned
friend
has
just
treated
this
court
are
the
result
of
a
lack
of
familiarity,
he
not
having
participated
in
the
many,
many
hearings,
the
many,
many
debates,
the
many,
many
briefs
that
have
been
exchanged,
that
i
shall
narrate
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
but
unless
the
force
of
what
i
want
to
say
be
forgotten
i
should
like
to
address
myself
before
i
make
my
organized
argument
to
a
few
propositions
which
mr.
kelly
has
adverted
to
before
the
effect
of
them
is
forgotten.
number
one,
you
were
told
that
the
plaintiff
has
been
stayed
to
this
moment
from
proceeding
with
his
side
of
the
case
procuring
an
answer,
or
taking
depositions,
or
doing
anything
of
the
kind.
it
is
not
so.
four
years
after
the
case
began
in
1960,
i
stated
orally
to
judge
herlands,
the
trial
judge
who
presided,
that
i
wanted
to
go
ahead
with
the
case
that
apparently
my
learned
adversary
then
preferred
not
to
move
it
along,
and
that
i
thought
the
reason
he
didn't
want
to
move
it
along,
was
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
united
states
government
to
try
a
oil
case
which
it
had
started
and
hoped
that
(a)
the
government
might
give
him
the
proof
which
he
needed
or
(b)
he
might
have
the
judgment
which
would
dispense
with
the
proof.
but
the
government
never
went
ahead
with
that
case,
incidentally
cities
service
was
not
a
party
to
that
case.
now
i
did
not
expect
in
1960
that
in
1967
i
would
again
have
to
tell
a
court
that
my
learned
friend
does
not
want
to
proceed
with
his
case.
he
could
have
had
his
answers
for
five
years.
he
could
have
had
his
depositions
for
years.
volume
iv
of
the
transcript
of
this
record,
which
is
available
to
the
court
is
the
monument
to
these
self-inflicted
delays,
which
my
learned
friend
has
suffered
from.
incidentally,
i
should
say
to
this
court
that
as
far
as
cities
service
is
concerned,
we
did
not
make
the
motion,
which
called
for
the
deposition
to
which
mr.
justice
fortas
has
addressed
himself.
it
is
true
that
a
number
of
the
other
defendants
who
are
still
in
the
case
did
tell
judge
weinfeld
who
presided
on
that
application
that
they
had
never
heard
of
this
plaintiff
and
that
was
a
fact.
he
had
never
been
in
the
oil
business
before.
he
was
food
broker
in
denver.
cities
service
had
heard
and
had
dealt
with
this
plaintiff,
consequently
we
were
in
no
position
to
make
any
such
declaration,
but
the
other
defendants
made
the
motion
and
did
persuade
a
very
careful
judge
to
allow
them
to
examine
first
before
they
were
required
to
answer.
in
the
formulation
of
that
decision
i
suspect
that
the
--
then
prevailing
rule
that
he
who
first
moved
shall
have
priority
played
a
part,
but
was
by
no
means
the
only
consideration,
which
moved
the
learned
judge
in
making
that
decision.
now
another
thing
that
was
referred
to
and
i
want
to
mention
before
i
get
into
my
argument
is
that
the
judges
below
that
is
both
judge
herlands
who
heard
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
unanimously
affirmed
his
judgment
had
imposed
upon
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
the
petitioner,
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
he
did
have
an
issue,
whereas
he
says
the
burden
should
have
be
been
upon
me
to
demonstrate
that
he
had
no
issue.
my
learned
friend
is
in
error.
i
remember
as
vividly
as
i
now
stand
that
before
judge
herlands
i
was
obliged
to
demonstrate
his
lack
of
an
issue
to
the
point
where
i
was
asked
to
demonstrate
the
elimination
of
every
possible
hypothesis
of
complicity
in
this
conspiracy.
that
was
the
test
which
judge
herlands
imposed
upon
me,
that
was
the
test
which
he
said,
“i
lived
up
to
when
i
succeeded
in
procuring
the
summary
judgment.”
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
i
will
try
to
give
you
that
in
a
minute.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
i
didn't
make
a
note
of
it
and
maybe
my
colleague
will
find
a
few
and
i
will
furnish
it.
i
do
not
want
to
pretend
to
a
capacity
which
i
--
like
this
case
has
been
in
progress
now
for
a
11
years
and
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
able
to
remember
the
exact
succession
of
events,
but
i'll
do
my
best.
the
record
reference
is
given
at
page
82
of
my
brief
and
it
occurs
at
transcript
volume
three,
page
97
and
98.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
well
of
course
i
do
not,
that's
been
the
law
as
long
as
i
can
remember
the
rule
of
summary
judgment.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
certainly
i'll
go
--
i
want
to
make
this
point.
i
have
not
discovered
expect
for
this
frivolous
suggestion
that
the
second
circuit
notorious
for
its
restricted
view
of
summary
judgment
has
misplead
that
burden.
except
for
that
frivolous
suggestion
there
is
no
question
of
law
here.
we're
all
in
agreement
as
to
what
the
rules
relating
to
summary
judgment
are
and
as
far
as
i
can
understand
the
only
argument
that
my
learned
friend
may
properly
advanced
to
you
is
that
in
this
case
the
district
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
misvalued
the
information
at
their
disposal
in
deciding
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
plaintiff
had
not
demonstrated
the
existence
of
a
genuine
issue.
my
learned
friend
said
in
the
course
of
his
opening
remarks
that
he
wants
us
to
assume
for
purposes
of
this
motion
that
all
of
the
other
defendants
are
guilty
of
a
conspiracy.
well,
i
must
part
company
with
him
and
i
hope
this
court
will.
i
hope
that
we
will
not
argue
this
motion
on
the
assumption
that
all
of
the
other
defendants
are
guilty
of
a
conspiracy.
suffice
it,
i
should
think
to
my
adversary's
case
is
that
there
is
a
pending
case
before
the
district
court
now
un-disposed
off,
indeed
unanswered
in
which
he
asserts
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
on
behalf
of
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
other
defendants,
and
that
matter
is
at
issue.
that
is
per
se
or
at
least
is
in
controversy.
it
has
not
yet
to
put
at
issue
because
no
answer
has
yet
been
demanded
by
my
learned
friend
from
the
other
defendants.
today
i
in
my
brief
i
suggested
that
there
were
three
times
at
which
plaintiff
changed
course
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
at
three
different
stages
the
plaintiff
adopted
three
theories
of
conspiracy
here.
today
for
the
first
time
i
heard
a
fourth
and
today
the
fourth
one
was
that
cities
service
joined
the
conspiracy
at
some
industry
association
meeting
in
november
of
1952.
i'll
simply
say
to
your
honor
that
this
is
the
first
time
in
all
these
many
years
that
this
motion
has
been
pending
and
the
motion
was
made
in
1960,
seven
years
ago
and
this
is
the
first
time
de
novo
that
i
hear
suggest
that
the
conspiracy
was
joined
in
november
of
1952.
the
question
was
asked
as
to
whether
the
rumor
or
the
statement
that
was
attributed
to
mr
wetzel
was
denied.
we
had
no
opportunity
mr.
justice
fortas
or
an
occasion
at
which
we
could
have
done
that.
we
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
depose
mr.
wetzel
but
he
died
as
have
a
number
of
other
persons
connected
with
case
before
his
turn
arrived.
but
it
is
not
true
that
jones
began
to
take
a
different
position
after
that
meeting
because
the
position
that
is
attributed
to
jones
is
one
that
he
consistently
maintains
throughout
as
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found.
now
let
me
go
on
to
the
regular
portion
of
my
argument.
the
action
as
you
heard
was
instituted
against
seven
companies,
one
of
them
cities
service
moved
for
summary
judgment.
it
was
granted
by
judge
herlands.
the
others
also
moved
for
summary
judgment,
that
you
have
not
yet
been
told.
later
in
the
proceeding,
the
six
other
defendants
likewise
made
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
in
the
same
decision
which
he
looked
with
favor,
but
did
not
finally
grant
upon
cities
service
motion
judge
herlands
denied
the
motion
of
all
of
the
other
defendants,
so
that
the
action
against
them
is
still
in
effect
and
it
was
the
granting
of
the
motion
in
favor
of
cities
service
which
was
unanimously
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
both
courts
agreeing
specifically
on
this
proposition,
that
there
was
no
issue
to
be
tried,
no
genuine
issue.
but
i
think
it
is
interesting
if
you
will
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
district
court,
that
they
went
beyond
that.
they
not
only
said
that
the
plaintiff
had
not
demonstrated
the
existence
of
a
genuine
issue,
which
they
did
so,
but
they
also
said
that
it
appears
plain
that
cities
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
conspiracy.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
no,
and
they
were
co-defendants
in
the
same
action.
but
they,
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
whereas
our
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted.
i
will
develop
it
a
little
bit
and
you
will
see
very
conspicuously
why
that
differentiation
was
made.
i
assume
that
the
legitimate
errors
of
which
my
learned
friend
may
complain
here
is
two.
first
that
the
respondent
has
not
in
fact
satisfied
the
requirements
of
the
rule
which
must
be
met
before
summary
judgment
may
be
granted;
and
second
that
the
trial
court
abused
its
discretion
in
limiting
its
deposition,
its
examinations
of
the
plaintiff
under
rule
56(f).
now
i
should
like
to
take
a
moment
to
emphasize
that.
56(f)
is
a
subdivision
of
the
summary
judgment
rule
which
provides
that
if
it
appears
that
the
person
to
whom
the
motion
is
addressed,
is
unable
to
furnish
the
necessary
affidavits
to
resist
the
motion
for
some
good
and
valid
reason,
the
court
may
authorize
him
to
take
the
deposition
with
respect
to
those
matters
that
he
says
he
wants
to
establish.
that
of
course
is
an
entirely
different
section
of
the
rule
from
that
which
provides
for
general
discovery,
26
fd
2nd.
now
i
would
like
to
emphasize
here
that
contrary
to
what
my
learned
friend
has
said
and
contrary
to
what
he
says
in
his
brief,
the
motion
he
made
before
the
district
court
was
for
examination
under
56(f)
and
not
for
the
general
right
of
examination.
indeed
i
give
you
the
record
reference
to
that
is
transcript
volume
three,
page
81.
he
said
he
wanted
an
opportunity
under
rule
56(f)
to
conduct
discovery
proceedings
and
when
the
judge
herlands
rendered
his
decision
he
said
with
respect
to
the
motion
under
rule
56(f)
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
its
opinion
it
addressed
itself
to
56(f),
but
i
go
further
and
again
i
must
assume
that
in
this
vast
record
of
thousands
of
pages
mr.
kelly
has
not
been
able
to
familiarize
himself
with
all
of
it.
in
the
oral
argument
judge
herlands
addressed
himself
to
counsel
and
said,
“i
call
your
attention
to
fact
that
56(f)
is
more
restrictive
in
scope
than
the
general
discovery
proceedings
under
26
and
so
forth.
do
you
realize
that?”
mr.
lane
said,
“yes,
i
realize
it
and
i
accept
it.”
now
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
both
possible
errors
to
which
mr.
kelly
has
adverted,
a
few
preliminaries.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
well,
there's
no
question
that
he
utilized
it
to
its
full
extent.
he
had
several
opportunities
to
examine
under
56(f)
as
the
court
of
appeals
says
ample
opportunities,
but
i'm
simply
saying
that
down
below
with
respect
to
my
motion
for
summary
judgment
he
never
asked
for
a
more
generalized
examination,
so
that
i
don't
see
how
i
can
be
now
subjected
to
the
argument
the
he
hasn't
had
it.
he
never
asked
for
it
as
far
as
my
motion
was
concerned.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
well
there
came
a
point
--
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
this
motion
was
made,
it
was
held
in
abeyance
until
he
could
examine
mr.
hill
for
reasons,
which
will
appear
in
a
moment.
he
then
examined
mr.
hill
and
he
produced
nothing
and
we
went
back
to
the
judge
several
years
later
and
we
said
he's
come
up
still
with
nothing.
he
said
well
--
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
oh,
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
you
allow
me?
the
judge
said
to
him,
“start
with
hill,”
and
i'll
tell
you
why
in
a
moment,
but
just
let
me
answer
mr.
justice
fortas'
question.
then
he
came
back
with
a
new
theory
and
that
new
theory,
a
new
hypothesis
of
conspiracy
justified
a
broader
examination.
whereupon
judge
herlands
said
to
him,
“i'll
allow
you
to
examine
every
living
person
who
participated
in
the
iranian
adventure.
you
can
examine
mr.
watson,
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
company,
mr.
fried
and
mr.
heskin
and
by
that
time
jones
was
dead
and
i'll
tell
you
how
that
came
about.
so
that
he
had
every
examination.
when
he
finished
with
those
he
still
produced
nothing
and
he
came
back
and
he
said
well
let
me
have
a
broad
examination
in
brooks
and
the
judge
said,
“no,
you
had
your
chance,”
and
that
was
the
story.
now
jones,
mr.
justice
brennan,
when
this
case
was
presented
to
the
district
court,
it
came
up
in
the
following
manner
and
i
think
it
is
of
the
utmost
gravity
that
we
get
–
important
that
we
understand.
the
plaintiff
in
his
complaint
segregated
cities
service
from
all
of
the
other
defendants.
he
said
that
the
other
defendants
engaged
in
a
cartel,
but
that
cities
was
not
a
member
of
it,
in
so
many
words.
he
said
that
the
other
defendants
had
conspired
to
monopolize
the
iranian
oil,
but
that
cities
was
not
a
member
of
it.
he
said
that
the
other
defendants
had
conspired
to
boycott
his
oil,
but
that
cities
was
not
a
member
of
it.
he
said
that
the
others
had
conspired
to
prevent
his
access
to
the
money
market,
but
that
cities
was
not
a
member
of
it.
he
said
cities
joined
the
conspiracy
and
i
quote
his
words
from
memory,
“by
these
acts,”
and
what
were
these
acts?
these
acts
he
said
were
that
he
had
learned
later,
mind
you
these
events
occurred
in
1952;
he
brought
his
complaints
in
1956.
he
said
he
discovered
in
1954
that
in
1952
gulf
and
british
petroleum
had
conspired
to
bribe
cities
service
with
a
contract
to
buy
oil
from
kuwait.
he
said
when
you
learn
that,
he
said
by
these
acts
it
joined
the
conspiracy,
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
it
was
thereafter
rewarded
for
joining
the
conspiracy
by
being
allowed
to
participate
in
a
consortium
which
was
established
in
1955.
so
when
i
proceeded
to
examine
the
plaintiff,
and
i
would
solicit
your
attention
to
that,
i
examined
him
precisely
and
i
asked
him
this
question.
are
you
saying
that
except
for
these
two
events
kuwait
and
consortium,
you
have
no
fault
to
find
cities
service?
he
said
that
is
right.
i
went
further,
i
said
would
have
made
them
defendants
but
for
these
two
things?
he
said,
i
never
would
have
made
them
defendants,
and
he
had
good
reason
for
saying
so,
why?
because
cities
service
treated
him
with
the
utmost
consideration
although
he
was
utterly
unknown
in
the
oil
business.
he
testified
that
his
only
contact
with
the
oil
business
was
an
occasional
visit
to
the
corner
pump
to
buy
10
gallons
of
gas
for
his
car.
although
he
was
a
man
who
had
never
earned
as
much
as
$10,000
a
year,
he
was
trying
to
enter
a
multi-million
dollar
business,
although
he
had
never
seen
a
tanker,
he
was
looking
for
a
fleet
of
several
hundred
tankers,
you
can
imagine.
nevertheless,
cities
service
embraced
him
and
with
him
went
to
iran
and
they
made
a
thorough
investigation
and
when
he
got
through
and
the
whole
thing
blew
up
and
nothing
came
of
it,
he
came
back
and
he
said
i
spent
some
time
and
some
money
on
this,
won't
you
reimburse
me
and
they
reimbursed
him,
and
he
was
very
happy
and
their
relations
were
of
the
most
amicable.
but
he
later
said
that
he
discovered
this
kuwait
and
consortium
deal,
he
said
that's
why
he
named
them
as
defendants.
shall
we
examine
him
of
that
and
having
established,
we
then
came
into
court
with
documentation
of
monumental
magnitude
to
demonstrate
that
he
was
wrong
about
his
basis
of
his
belief,
that
the
kuwait
contract
had
been
started
in
1948,
had
been
negotiated,
it
was
a
very
elaborate
operation
that
involved
the
building
of
many
tankers,
it
involved
the
building
and
assignment
of
a
refinery
and
before
mr.
waldron
had
ever
set
foot
in
cities
service
office,
the
contract
between
gulf
and
cities
service
for
gulf
--
kuwait
oil
had
been
fully
approved,
but
only
the
signature
remained
open.
that
was
our
proof
and
we
also
demonstrated
that
as
far
as
the
consortium
was
concerned
far
from
being
invited
into
the
consortium,
cities
service
fought
like
a
tiger
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
participate.
it
finally
got
a
minuscule
invitation
of
forty
five
hundredths
of
a
percent,
and
they
said
we
won't
take
it,
it's
too
small
to
bother.
so
having
demonstrated
that
we
made
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
almost
there,
but
here
was
a
man
who
says
the
only
reason
i
made
you
a
defendant
is
because
i
think
you
were
bribed
by
kuwait
and
rewarded
by
consortium,
here
is
the
proof
that
it
isn't
so.
well
our
learned
adversaries
did
their
best
to
try
to
demolish
what
we
did,
but
they
failed.
so
much
so,
that
after
that
argument
we
never
heard
another
word
about
kuwait
or
consortium
until
we
got
here
into
this
court,
as
if
this
was
a
trial
de
novo.
indeed
--
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
well,
the
reason
we
didn't
tender
jones
in
the
first
instance
was
because
jones
was
irrelevant
to
that
discovery
since
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kuwait
or
the
consortium
operation,
with
that
--
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
oh
hill
was
in-charge
of
it.
he
was
the
executive
who
had
negotiated
the
entire
kuwait
operation.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
in
1962.
he
was
killed
in
an
airplane
accident
and
--
so
at
the
time
that
this
deposition
was
ordered
of
hill,
hill
was
the
logical
man,
indeed
they
asked
him.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
this
was
in
1961.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
1962
yes.
in
1961,
and
then
mr.
judge
herlands
said
to
my
adversary,
“start
with
hill.
if
it
then
develops
that
you
need
somebody
else,
i'll
allow
you.”
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
no,
no,
no,
no.
he
didn't
ask
–
he
suggested
that
he
wanted
to
examine.
now
by
the
time
hill's
examination
was
taken
jones
was
dead.
the
reason
that
hill's
examination
was
delayed
was
because
my
learned
friend
just
didn't
move
it
along,
he
took
a
year
before
he
reached
us.
i
think
20
days
of
examination.
25
days
examination
was
taken
during
that
whole
year
while
we
waited
clamoring
for
an
opportunity
to
have
him
examine
hill
so
that
we
could
go
along,
and
as
i
told
judge
herlands,
i
wanted
to
resign
from
this
very
expensive
club
in
which
i
was
a
compelled
member,
it
was
very
expensive
for
cities
service
to
participate
in
this
controversy.
well
my
time
is
running
very
fast.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
so
we
come
to
the
point
where
the
kuwait
and
consortium
deal
was
destroyed
and
demolished
and
so
much
so
that
judge
herlands
made
a
finding.
he
said,
“i
am
convinced
to
a
certainty
that
neither
kuwait
nor
consortium
had
anything
to
do
with
the
conduct
of
cities
service
in
this
case.”
thereupon
permissibly
they
came
up
with
a
new
hypothesis.
they
said
it
wasn't
kuwait,
consortium,
it
was
something
different.
they
said
–-
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
gone.
they
came
in
and
said
this
conspiracy
really
happened
on
september
25,
1952,
pinpointed
it
just
like
that,
where
the
dart
on
the
date.
on
that
date
waldron
and
jones
said
goodbye
to
each
other
in
paris
on
their
way
back
from
iraq
and
said
mr.
lane,
at
that
moment
of
time
jones
joined
the
conspiracy
and
how
does
he
measure
that?
he
says,
they
were
going
one
way
and
then
he
turned
a
180
degrees
around
and
went
the
other.
what
was
the
other
way?
he
says
until
then
they
were
interested
in
taking
over
the
management
of
the
iranian
industry,
on
that
day
he
decided
he
wasn't
going
to
do
it.
well
a
lot
of
water
went
over
the
dam
after
that
time
until
we
come
to
a
later
date
and
mr.
lane
files
an
affidavit
under
oath
in
which
he
says,
“i
have
found
out
that
i
was
wrong.”
you
will
find
a
citation
to
the
record
where
he
said
it
on
page
54
of
my
brief.
he
said,
“it
does
not
happen
to
be
the
fact
however
that
cities
lost
interest
in
iranian
oil,”
and
he
negates
his
180
degree
turnaround.
and
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
you
see
that
they
too
find
that
it
was
a
misapprehension
on
our
learned
friend's
part
when
he
thought
that
was.
indeed
after
september
25,
jones
did
a
hundred
different
things
to
continue
his
interest
in
iranian
oil.
so
much
so
that
he
went
out
and
hired
john
w.
davis
to
write
an
opinion
to
establish
the
proposition
that
the
british
were
wrong
and
that
the
iranians
were
right.
he
kept
that
opinion
and
he
sent
it
to
the
incoming
attorney
general
mr.
brownell
and
to
the
incoming
secretary
of
state
mr.
dulles
and
he
said
this
is
what
i
believe
the
law
to
be,
but
he
also
said
having
been
in
the
ramp
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
can't
overnight
take
a
market
which
had
existed
in
the
eastern
hemisphere
and
suddenly
convert
it
and
make
it
available
for
the
western
hemisphere.
he
didn't
know
how
to
do
that,
and
he
says
you
can't
take
an
industry
of
that
size
requiring
500
tankers
to
move
and
suddenly
overnight
build
a
fleet
of
that
kind
in
order
to
shift
that
market
into
the
western
hemisphere
and
other
reasons
why
it
couldn't
be
done.
he
said
why
he
couldn't
operate
the
plant
because
it
was
built
by
the
british
and
they
are
the
only
ones
who
control
the
replacement
and
repair
parts
for
it.
well
there
upon
they
said
other
things
and
just
to
briefly
use
up
my
few
moments,
we
then
submitted
an
affidavit
and
in
which
i
listed
every
blessed
fact
that
have
been
stated
by
the
plaintiff
and
demonstrated
to
a
qed
but
they
didn't
have
an
issue.
then
it
was
under
the
pressure
of
that
that
mr.
lane
wrote
in
his
brief
what
i
quote
on
page,
top
of
page
of
54
and
which
appears
at
volume
2,
page
460
of
the
transcript.
he
said,
“i
don't
claim
--
plaintiff
doesn't
claim
that
jones
was
acting
on
behalf
of
the
conspiracy
when
he
went
to
iran,
that
was
in
august
of
1952,
or
when
he
held
his
tehran
conference,
or
when
he
wrote
his
conclusions
to
his
draft
report,”
and
that
he
says
occurred
on
october
31,
1952.
so
that
we
have
mr.
lane's
admission
in
the
most
formal
manner
that
you
could
present
it
in
the
court,
that
down
to
october
31,
1952,
jones
had
not
yet
joined
the
conspiracy.
now
my
learned
friend
in
his
reply
brief
charges
me,
he
says
that
i
have
read
that
language
out
of
context.
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
you
read
it,
you
will
find
that
i
did
not
read
it
out
of
context,
but
i'll
go
further.
i
made
that
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
mr.
lane
was
there
and
mr.
lane
never
said
that
i
spoke
anything
out
of
context
with
respect
to
that.
he
did
not
say
i
misunderstood
him.
this
was
an
admission
that
down
to
that
time
there
were
no
conspiracy.
the
next
date
of
significance
is
1955,
that's
the
date
when
the
consortium
is
put
together,
but
we
have
it
in
this
record
that
in
1954
the
representative
of
cities
service
went
down
to
washington
and
pleaded
and
argued
against
the
so
called
conspiracy.
they
told
herbert
c.
hoover,
then
the
assistant
or
under
secretary
of
state
that
the
consortium
idea
was
antithetical
to
non
monopolistic
practices
in
the
oil
industry
and
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
create
it
and
that
what
they
ought
to
do
is
open
it
wide
open
and
they
fought
for
that,
certainly
none
anti-conspiratorial
conflict.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
as
i
said
the
secretary
of
state
appointed
price
waterhouse,
a
company
to
examine
applicants
into
the
consortium
and
cities
was
one
of
the
applicants
and
they
came
out
with
a
report
and
said
they
were
qualified
to
enter
it,
but
they
were
entitled
to
forty
five
hundreds
a
percent
of
1%
of
the
supply,
and
the
cities
service
said
they
wouldn't
be
bothered
with
that.
they
turned
that
over
to
richfield
oil
company
and
i
think
richfield
did
it.
the
majors
that
we
talk
about
here
got
30%
of
the
total
consortium
allotment
under
that
consortium
arrangement.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
cities
service
at
that
time
is
a
minority
stock
holder
of
richfield,
that
is
true.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
never
joined
and
has
never
been
a
member
of
it.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
cities
service
has
not
richfield.
richfield
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
split
off
from
cities
service
and
joined
with
atlantic
oil.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
that
was
another
case
in
california.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
well
i
just
haven't
got
the
fact.
now
i
don't
know
whether
i
mentioned
the
fact
but
i
should
mention
the
fact,
we
had
nine
arguments
before
judge
herlands
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
in
order
but
in
the
second
circuit
at
least
we
regard
him
as
one
of
the
most
painstaking
judges.
he
denied
me
the
motion
on
the
first
argument.
he
said
because
of
the
highly
restricted
policy
in
the
second
circuit,
and
he
later
said
on
the
record,
i
should
have
granted
it
then.
indeed
he
said
i
should
have
perhaps
stricken
the
complaint
because
once
the
basis
for
the
allegation
evaporated
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
really
should
have
withdrawn
his
signature
to
the
complaint
under
the
rule
of
11.
but
he
said
as
a
matter
of
policy
not
of
logic
he
said
so,
i
allow
them
to
have
some
examination.
when
he
used
the
power
under
the
56(d)
to
interrogate
counsel,
counsel
told
him
that
he
thought
he
was
entitled
to
have
an
antitrust
case
based
on
suspicion
alone.
he
said
he
thought
that's
the
way
antitrust
cases
should
be
initiated
on
suspicion
and
he
thought,
that
once
he
was
able
to
utter
the
words,
did
cities
service
join
the
conspiracy,
that
was
that.
i
want
to
take
the
last
minute
or
two
i
have
to
refer
to
one
thing
about
which
i
feel
very
badly.
as
reference
made
in
this
brief
the
conversations
between
jones
and
a
man
named
sandberg
in
amsterdam.
the
facts
are,
the
record
shows
that
sandberg
a
very
large
and
substantial
stockholder
of
cities
service,
a
resident
of
amsterdam
was
jones'
host
on
the
way
from
new
york
to
iran,
he
stopped
off
in
amsterdam
and
did
all
on
the
way
back
and
the
following
occurred.
at
the
ebt,
examination
before
trial
of
mr.
watson
then
the
chairman
of
the
board
or
the
retired
chairman
of
the
board.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
mr.
--
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
said
to
mr.
watson,
i
have
just
discovered
that
sandberg
is
a
member
of
the
finance
committee
of
shell
oil
and
then,
and
this
was
off
the
record
before
we
met,
and
it
is
now
in
our
affidavit.
then
he
begins
his
questioning,
he
says,
“did
you
know
that
sandberg
was
a
member
of
the
shell
oil
finance
committee?”
he
says,
“i
know
it
now.
i
don't
know
when
i
learned
it
first,”
he
is
a
man
then
in
his
early
70s.
we
then
investigated
the
matter
and
found
that
there
was
utterly
no
basis
for
to
sandberg
file
his
affidavit
that
we
never
had
anything
to
do
with
shell.
we
told
that
to
mr.
lane.
mr.
lane
says
i
am
going
to
investigate.
this
was
in
november
1964,
three
years
ago.
there
hasn't
been
one
scintilla
since
then
to
contradict
what
we
said,
but
i
find
it
referred
to
in
this
brief
and
to
that
i
would
like
to
take
exception.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
that
i've
just
heard
argued
is
somewhat
different
from
the
case
to
which
i
have
spent
about
11
years
of
my
life.
the
plaintiff
had
been
represented
until
this
argument
by
the
late
mr.
samuel
lane,
who
is
a
very
able,
very
resourceful
lawyer,
in
addition
if
i
maybe
allowed
to
say
a
very
gallant
gentleman.
he
has
been
lost
at
sea
and
on
one
have
seen
him
for
sometime,
i
assume
his
death
is
now
presumed.
so
i
shall
assume
that
those
departures
from
what
happened
from
the
story
of
this
case
to
which
my
learned
friend
has
just
treated
this
court
are
the
result
of
a
lack
of
familiarity,
he
not
having
participated
in
the
many,
many
hearings,
the
many,
many
debates,
the
many,
many
briefs
that
have
been
exchanged,
that
i
shall
narrate
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
but
unless
the
force
of
what
i
want
to
say
be
forgotten
i
should
like
to
address
myself
before
i
make
my
organized
argument
to
a
few
propositions
which
mr.
kelly
has
adverted
to
before
the
effect
of
them
is
forgotten.
number
one,
you
were
told
that
the
plaintiff
has
been
stayed
to
this
moment
from
proceeding
with
his
side
of
the
case
procuring
an
answer,
or
taking
depositions,
or
doing
anything
of
the
kind.
it
is
not
so.
four
years
after
the
case
began
in
1960,
i
stated
orally
to
judge
herlands,
the
trial
judge
who
presided,
that
i
wanted
to
go
ahead
with
the
case
that
apparently
my
learned
adversary
then
preferred
not
to
move
it
along,
and
that
i
thought
the
reason
he
didn't
want
to
move
it
along,
was
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
united
states
government
to
try
a
oil
case
which
it
had
started
and
hoped
that
(a)
the
government
might
give
him
the
proof
which
he
needed
or
(b)
he
might
have
the
judgment
which
would
dispense
with
the
proof.
but
the
government
never
went
ahead
with
that
case,
incidentally
cities
service
was
not
a
party
to
that
case.
now
i
did
not
expect
in
1960
that
in
1967
i
would
again
have
to
tell
a
court
that
my
learned
friend
does
not
want
to
proceed
with
his
case.
he
could
have
had
his
answers
for
five
years.
he
could
have
had
his
depositions
for
years.
volume
iv
of
the
transcript
of
this
record,
which
is
available
to
the
court
is
the
monument
to
these
self-inflicted
delays,
which
my
learned
friend
has
suffered
from.
incidentally,
i
should
say
to
this
court
that
as
far
as
cities
service
is
concerned,
we
did
not
make
the
motion,
which
called
for
the
deposition
to
which
mr.
justice
fortas
has
addressed
himself.
it
is
true
that
a
number
of
the
other
defendants
who
are
still
in
the
case
did
tell
judge
weinfeld
who
presided
on
that
application
that
they
had
never
heard
of
this
plaintiff
and
that
was
a
fact.
he
had
never
been
in
the
oil
business
before.
he
was
food
broker
in
denver.
cities
service
had
heard
and
had
dealt
with
this
plaintiff,
consequently
we
were
in
no
position
to
make
any
such
declaration,
but
the
other
defendants
made
the
motion
and
did
persuade
a
very
careful
judge
to
allow
them
to
examine
first
before
they
were
required
to
answer.
in
the
formulation
of
that
decision
i
suspect
that
the
--
then
prevailing
rule
that
he
who
first
moved
shall
have
priority
played
a
part,
but
was
by
no
means
the
only
consideration,
which
moved
the
learned
judge
in
making
that
decision.
now
another
thing
that
was
referred
to
and
i
want
to
mention
before
i
get
into
my
argument
is
that
the
judges
below
that
is
both
judge
herlands
who
heard
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
unanimously
affirmed
his
judgment
had
imposed
upon
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
the
petitioner,
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
he
did
have
an
issue,
whereas
he
says
the
burden
should
have
be
been
upon
me
to
demonstrate
that
he
had
no
issue.
my
learned
friend
is
in
error.
i
remember
as
vividly
as
i
now
stand
that
before
judge
herlands
i
was
obliged
to
demonstrate
his
lack
of
an
issue
to
the
point
where
i
was
asked
to
demonstrate
the
elimination
of
every
possible
hypothesis
of
complicity
in
this
conspiracy.
that
was
the
test
which
judge
herlands
imposed
upon
me,
that
was
the
test
which
he
said,
“i
lived
up
to
when
i
succeeded
in
procuring
the
summary
judgment.”
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
i
will
try
to
give
you
that
in
a
minute.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
i
didn't
make
a
note
of
it
and
maybe
my
colleague
will
find
a
few
and
i
will
furnish
it.
i
do
not
want
to
pretend
to
a
capacity
which
i
--
like
this
case
has
been
in
progress
now
for
a
11
years
and
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
able
to
remember
the
exact
succession
of
events,
but
i'll
do
my
best.
the
record
reference
is
given
at
page
82
of
my
brief
and
it
occurs
at
transcript
volume
three,
page
97
and
98.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
well
of
course
i
do
not,
that's
been
the
law
as
long
as
i
can
remember
the
rule
of
summary
judgment.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
certainly
i'll
go
--
i
want
to
make
this
point.
i
have
not
discovered
expect
for
this
frivolous
suggestion
that
the
second
circuit
notorious
for
its
restricted
view
of
summary
judgment
has
misplead
that
burden.
except
for
that
frivolous
suggestion
there
is
no
question
of
law
here.
we're
all
in
agreement
as
to
what
the
rules
relating
to
summary
judgment
are
and
as
far
as
i
can
understand
the
only
argument
that
my
learned
friend
may
properly
advanced
to
you
is
that
in
this
case
the
district
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
misvalued
the
information
at
their
disposal
in
deciding
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
plaintiff
had
not
demonstrated
the
existence
of
a
genuine
issue.
my
learned
friend
said
in
the
course
of
his
opening
remarks
that
he
wants
us
to
assume
for
purposes
of
this
motion
that
all
of
the
other
defendants
are
guilty
of
a
conspiracy.
well,
i
must
part
company
with
him
and
i
hope
this
court
will.
i
hope
that
we
will
not
argue
this
motion
on
the
assumption
that
all
of
the
other
defendants
are
guilty
of
a
conspiracy.
suffice
it,
i
should
think
to
my
adversary's
case
is
that
there
is
a
pending
case
before
the
district
court
now
un-disposed
off,
indeed
unanswered
in
which
he
asserts
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
on
behalf
of
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
other
defendants,
and
that
matter
is
at
issue.
that
is
per
se
or
at
least
is
in
controversy.
it
has
not
yet
to
put
at
issue
because
no
answer
has
yet
been
demanded
by
my
learned
friend
from
the
other
defendants.
today
i
in
my
brief
i
suggested
that
there
were
three
times
at
which
plaintiff
changed
course
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
at
three
different
stages
the
plaintiff
adopted
three
theories
of
conspiracy
here.
today
for
the
first
time
i
heard
a
fourth
and
today
the
fourth
one
was
that
cities
service
joined
the
conspiracy
at
some
industry
association
meeting
in
november
of
1952.
i'll
simply
say
to
your
honor
that
this
is
the
first
time
in
all
these
many
years
that
this
motion
has
been
pending
and
the
motion
was
made
in
1960,
seven
years
ago
and
this
is
the
first
time
de
novo
that
i
hear
suggest
that
the
conspiracy
was
joined
in
november
of
1952.
the
question
was
asked
as
to
whether
the
rumor
or
the
statement
that
was
attributed
to
mr
wetzel
was
denied.
we
had
no
opportunity
mr.
justice
fortas
or
an
occasion
at
which
we
could
have
done
that.
we
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
depose
mr.
wetzel
but
he
died
as
have
a
number
of
other
persons
connected
with
case
before
his
turn
arrived.
but
it
is
not
true
that
jones
began
to
take
a
different
position
after
that
meeting
because
the
position
that
is
attributed
to
jones
is
one
that
he
consistently
maintains
throughout
as
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found.
now
let
me
go
on
to
the
regular
portion
of
my
argument.
the
action
as
you
heard
was
instituted
against
seven
companies,
one
of
them
cities
service
moved
for
summary
judgment.
it
was
granted
by
judge
herlands.
the
others
also
moved
for
summary
judgment,
that
you
have
not
yet
been
told.
later
in
the
proceeding,
the
six
other
defendants
likewise
made
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
in
the
same
decision
which
he
looked
with
favor,
but
did
not
finally
grant
upon
cities
service
motion
judge
herlands
denied
the
motion
of
all
of
the
other
defendants,
so
that
the
action
against
them
is
still
in
effect
and
it
was
the
granting
of
the
motion
in
favor
of
cities
service
which
was
unanimously
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
both
courts
agreeing
specifically
on
this
proposition,
that
there
was
no
issue
to
be
tried,
no
genuine
issue.
but
i
think
it
is
interesting
if
you
will
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
district
court,
that
they
went
beyond
that.
they
not
only
said
that
the
plaintiff
had
not
demonstrated
the
existence
of
a
genuine
issue,
which
they
did
so,
but
they
also
said
that
it
appears
plain
that
cities
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
conspiracy.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
no,
and
they
were
co-defendants
in
the
same
action.
but
they,
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
whereas
our
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted.
i
will
develop
it
a
little
bit
and
you
will
see
very
conspicuously
why
that
differentiation
was
made.
i
assume
that
the
legitimate
errors
of
which
my
learned
friend
may
complain
here
is
two.
first
that
the
respondent
has
not
in
fact
satisfied
the
requirements
of
the
rule
which
must
be
met
before
summary
judgment
may
be
granted;
and
second
that
the
trial
court
abused
its
discretion
in
limiting
its
deposition,
its
examinations
of
the
plaintiff
under
rule
56(f).
now
i
should
like
to
take
a
moment
to
emphasize
that.
56(f)
is
a
subdivision
of
the
summary
judgment
rule
which
provides
that
if
it
appears
that
the
person
to
whom
the
motion
is
addressed,
is
unable
to
furnish
the
necessary
affidavits
to
resist
the
motion
for
some
good
and
valid
reason,
the
court
may
authorize
him
to
take
the
deposition
with
respect
to
those
matters
that
he
says
he
wants
to
establish.
that
of
course
is
an
entirely
different
section
of
the
rule
from
that
which
provides
for
general
discovery,
26
fd
2nd.
now
i
would
like
to
emphasize
here
that
contrary
to
what
my
learned
friend
has
said
and
contrary
to
what
he
says
in
his
brief,
the
motion
he
made
before
the
district
court
was
for
examination
under
56(f)
and
not
for
the
general
right
of
examination.
indeed
i
give
you
the
record
reference
to
that
is
transcript
volume
three,
page
81.
he
said
he
wanted
an
opportunity
under
rule
56(f)
to
conduct
discovery
proceedings
and
when
the
judge
herlands
rendered
his
decision
he
said
with
respect
to
the
motion
under
rule
56(f)
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
its
opinion
it
addressed
itself
to
56(f),
but
i
go
further
and
again
i
must
assume
that
in
this
vast
record
of
thousands
of
pages
mr.
kelly
has
not
been
able
to
familiarize
himself
with
all
of
it.
in
the
oral
argument
judge
herlands
addressed
himself
to
counsel
and
said,
“i
call
your
attention
to
fact
that
56(f)
is
more
restrictive
in
scope
than
the
general
discovery
proceedings
under
26
and
so
forth.
do
you
realize
that?”
mr.
lane
said,
“yes,
i
realize
it
and
i
accept
it.”
now
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
both
possible
errors
to
which
mr.
kelly
has
adverted,
a
few
preliminaries.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
well,
there's
no
question
that
he
utilized
it
to
its
full
extent.
he
had
several
opportunities
to
examine
under
56(f)
as
the
court
of
appeals
says
ample
opportunities,
but
i'm
simply
saying
that
down
below
with
respect
to
my
motion
for
summary
judgment
he
never
asked
for
a
more
generalized
examination,
so
that
i
don't
see
how
i
can
be
now
subjected
to
the
argument
the
he
hasn't
had
it.
he
never
asked
for
it
as
far
as
my
motion
was
concerned.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
well
there
came
a
point
--
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
this
motion
was
made,
it
was
held
in
abeyance
until
he
could
examine
mr.
hill
for
reasons,
which
will
appear
in
a
moment.
he
then
examined
mr.
hill
and
he
produced
nothing
and
we
went
back
to
the
judge
several
years
later
and
we
said
he's
come
up
still
with
nothing.
he
said
well
--
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
oh,
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
you
allow
me?
the
judge
said
to
him,
“start
with
hill,”
and
i'll
tell
you
why
in
a
moment,
but
just
let
me
answer
mr.
justice
fortas'
question.
then
he
came
back
with
a
new
theory
and
that
new
theory,
a
new
hypothesis
of
conspiracy
justified
a
broader
examination.
whereupon
judge
herlands
said
to
him,
“i'll
allow
you
to
examine
every
living
person
who
participated
in
the
iranian
adventure.
you
can
examine
mr.
watson,
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
company,
mr.
fried
and
mr.
heskin
and
by
that
time
jones
was
dead
and
i'll
tell
you
how
that
came
about.
so
that
he
had
every
examination.
when
he
finished
with
those
he
still
produced
nothing
and
he
came
back
and
he
said
well
let
me
have
a
broad
examination
in
brooks
and
the
judge
said,
“no,
you
had
your
chance,”
and
that
was
the
story.
now
jones,
mr.
justice
brennan,
when
this
case
was
presented
to
the
district
court,
it
came
up
in
the
following
manner
and
i
think
it
is
of
the
utmost
gravity
that
we
get
–
important
that
we
understand.
the
plaintiff
in
his
complaint
segregated
cities
service
from
all
of
the
other
defendants.
he
said
that
the
other
defendants
engaged
in
a
cartel,
but
that
cities
was
not
a
member
of
it,
in
so
many
words.
he
said
that
the
other
defendants
had
conspired
to
monopolize
the
iranian
oil,
but
that
cities
was
not
a
member
of
it.
he
said
that
the
other
defendants
had
conspired
to
boycott
his
oil,
but
that
cities
was
not
a
member
of
it.
he
said
that
the
others
had
conspired
to
prevent
his
access
to
the
money
market,
but
that
cities
was
not
a
member
of
it.
he
said
cities
joined
the
conspiracy
and
i
quote
his
words
from
memory,
“by
these
acts,”
and
what
were
these
acts?
these
acts
he
said
were
that
he
had
learned
later,
mind
you
these
events
occurred
in
1952;
he
brought
his
complaints
in
1956.
he
said
he
discovered
in
1954
that
in
1952
gulf
and
british
petroleum
had
conspired
to
bribe
cities
service
with
a
contract
to
buy
oil
from
kuwait.
he
said
when
you
learn
that,
he
said
by
these
acts
it
joined
the
conspiracy,
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
it
was
thereafter
rewarded
for
joining
the
conspiracy
by
being
allowed
to
participate
in
a
consortium
which
was
established
in
1955.
so
when
i
proceeded
to
examine
the
plaintiff,
and
i
would
solicit
your
attention
to
that,
i
examined
him
precisely
and
i
asked
him
this
question.
are
you
saying
that
except
for
these
two
events
kuwait
and
consortium,
you
have
no
fault
to
find
cities
service?
he
said
that
is
right.
i
went
further,
i
said
would
have
made
them
defendants
but
for
these
two
things?
he
said,
i
never
would
have
made
them
defendants,
and
he
had
good
reason
for
saying
so,
why?
because
cities
service
treated
him
with
the
utmost
consideration
although
he
was
utterly
unknown
in
the
oil
business.
he
testified
that
his
only
contact
with
the
oil
business
was
an
occasional
visit
to
the
corner
pump
to
buy
10
gallons
of
gas
for
his
car.
although
he
was
a
man
who
had
never
earned
as
much
as
$10,000
a
year,
he
was
trying
to
enter
a
multi-million
dollar
business,
although
he
had
never
seen
a
tanker,
he
was
looking
for
a
fleet
of
several
hundred
tankers,
you
can
imagine.
nevertheless,
cities
service
embraced
him
and
with
him
went
to
iran
and
they
made
a
thorough
investigation
and
when
he
got
through
and
the
whole
thing
blew
up
and
nothing
came
of
it,
he
came
back
and
he
said
i
spent
some
time
and
some
money
on
this,
won't
you
reimburse
me
and
they
reimbursed
him,
and
he
was
very
happy
and
their
relations
were
of
the
most
amicable.
but
he
later
said
that
he
discovered
this
kuwait
and
consortium
deal,
he
said
that's
why
he
named
them
as
defendants.
shall
we
examine
him
of
that
and
having
established,
we
then
came
into
court
with
documentation
of
monumental
magnitude
to
demonstrate
that
he
was
wrong
about
his
basis
of
his
belief,
that
the
kuwait
contract
had
been
started
in
1948,
had
been
negotiated,
it
was
a
very
elaborate
operation
that
involved
the
building
of
many
tankers,
it
involved
the
building
and
assignment
of
a
refinery
and
before
mr.
waldron
had
ever
set
foot
in
cities
service
office,
the
contract
between
gulf
and
cities
service
for
gulf
--
kuwait
oil
had
been
fully
approved,
but
only
the
signature
remained
open.
that
was
our
proof
and
we
also
demonstrated
that
as
far
as
the
consortium
was
concerned
far
from
being
invited
into
the
consortium,
cities
service
fought
like
a
tiger
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
participate.
it
finally
got
a
minuscule
invitation
of
forty
five
hundredths
of
a
percent,
and
they
said
we
won't
take
it,
it's
too
small
to
bother.
so
having
demonstrated
that
we
made
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
almost
there,
but
here
was
a
man
who
says
the
only
reason
i
made
you
a
defendant
is
because
i
think
you
were
bribed
by
kuwait
and
rewarded
by
consortium,
here
is
the
proof
that
it
isn't
so.
well
our
learned
adversaries
did
their
best
to
try
to
demolish
what
we
did,
but
they
failed.
so
much
so,
that
after
that
argument
we
never
heard
another
word
about
kuwait
or
consortium
until
we
got
here
into
this
court,
as
if
this
was
a
trial
de
novo.
indeed
--
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
well,
the
reason
we
didn't
tender
jones
in
the
first
instance
was
because
jones
was
irrelevant
to
that
discovery
since
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kuwait
or
the
consortium
operation,
with
that
--
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
oh
hill
was
in-charge
of
it.
he
was
the
executive
who
had
negotiated
the
entire
kuwait
operation.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
in
1962.
he
was
killed
in
an
airplane
accident
and
--
so
at
the
time
that
this
deposition
was
ordered
of
hill,
hill
was
the
logical
man,
indeed
they
asked
him.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
this
was
in
1961.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
1962
yes.
in
1961,
and
then
mr.
judge
herlands
said
to
my
adversary,
“start
with
hill.
if
it
then
develops
that
you
need
somebody
else,
i'll
allow
you.”
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
no,
no,
no,
no.
he
didn't
ask
–
he
suggested
that
he
wanted
to
examine.
now
by
the
time
hill's
examination
was
taken
jones
was
dead.
the
reason
that
hill's
examination
was
delayed
was
because
my
learned
friend
just
didn't
move
it
along,
he
took
a
year
before
he
reached
us.
i
think
20
days
of
examination.
25
days
examination
was
taken
during
that
whole
year
while
we
waited
clamoring
for
an
opportunity
to
have
him
examine
hill
so
that
we
could
go
along,
and
as
i
told
judge
herlands,
i
wanted
to
resign
from
this
very
expensive
club
in
which
i
was
a
compelled
member,
it
was
very
expensive
for
cities
service
to
participate
in
this
controversy.
well
my
time
is
running
very
fast.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
so
we
come
to
the
point
where
the
kuwait
and
consortium
deal
was
destroyed
and
demolished
and
so
much
so
that
judge
herlands
made
a
finding.
he
said,
“i
am
convinced
to
a
certainty
that
neither
kuwait
nor
consortium
had
anything
to
do
with
the
conduct
of
cities
service
in
this
case.”
thereupon
permissibly
they
came
up
with
a
new
hypothesis.
they
said
it
wasn't
kuwait,
consortium,
it
was
something
different.
they
said
–-
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
gone.
they
came
in
and
said
this
conspiracy
really
happened
on
september
25,
1952,
pinpointed
it
just
like
that,
where
the
dart
on
the
date.
on
that
date
waldron
and
jones
said
goodbye
to
each
other
in
paris
on
their
way
back
from
iraq
and
said
mr.
lane,
at
that
moment
of
time
jones
joined
the
conspiracy
and
how
does
he
measure
that?
he
says,
they
were
going
one
way
and
then
he
turned
a
180
degrees
around
and
went
the
other.
what
was
the
other
way?
he
says
until
then
they
were
interested
in
taking
over
the
management
of
the
iranian
industry,
on
that
day
he
decided
he
wasn't
going
to
do
it.
well
a
lot
of
water
went
over
the
dam
after
that
time
until
we
come
to
a
later
date
and
mr.
lane
files
an
affidavit
under
oath
in
which
he
says,
“i
have
found
out
that
i
was
wrong.”
you
will
find
a
citation
to
the
record
where
he
said
it
on
page
54
of
my
brief.
he
said,
“it
does
not
happen
to
be
the
fact
however
that
cities
lost
interest
in
iranian
oil,”
and
he
negates
his
180
degree
turnaround.
and
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
you
see
that
they
too
find
that
it
was
a
misapprehension
on
our
learned
friend's
part
when
he
thought
that
was.
indeed
after
september
25,
jones
did
a
hundred
different
things
to
continue
his
interest
in
iranian
oil.
so
much
so
that
he
went
out
and
hired
john
w.
davis
to
write
an
opinion
to
establish
the
proposition
that
the
british
were
wrong
and
that
the
iranians
were
right.
he
kept
that
opinion
and
he
sent
it
to
the
incoming
attorney
general
mr.
brownell
and
to
the
incoming
secretary
of
state
mr.
dulles
and
he
said
this
is
what
i
believe
the
law
to
be,
but
he
also
said
having
been
in
the
ramp
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
can't
overnight
take
a
market
which
had
existed
in
the
eastern
hemisphere
and
suddenly
convert
it
and
make
it
available
for
the
western
hemisphere.
he
didn't
know
how
to
do
that,
and
he
says
you
can't
take
an
industry
of
that
size
requiring
500
tankers
to
move
and
suddenly
overnight
build
a
fleet
of
that
kind
in
order
to
shift
that
market
into
the
western
hemisphere
and
other
reasons
why
it
couldn't
be
done.
he
said
why
he
couldn't
operate
the
plant
because
it
was
built
by
the
british
and
they
are
the
only
ones
who
control
the
replacement
and
repair
parts
for
it.
well
there
upon
they
said
other
things
and
just
to
briefly
use
up
my
few
moments,
we
then
submitted
an
affidavit
and
in
which
i
listed
every
blessed
fact
that
have
been
stated
by
the
plaintiff
and
demonstrated
to
a
qed
but
they
didn't
have
an
issue.
then
it
was
under
the
pressure
of
that
that
mr.
lane
wrote
in
his
brief
what
i
quote
on
page,
top
of
page
of
54
and
which
appears
at
volume
2,
page
460
of
the
transcript.
he
said,
“i
don't
claim
--
plaintiff
doesn't
claim
that
jones
was
acting
on
behalf
of
the
conspiracy
when
he
went
to
iran,
that
was
in
august
of
1952,
or
when
he
held
his
tehran
conference,
or
when
he
wrote
his
conclusions
to
his
draft
report,”
and
that
he
says
occurred
on
october
31,
1952.
so
that
we
have
mr.
lane's
admission
in
the
most
formal
manner
that
you
could
present
it
in
the
court,
that
down
to
october
31,
1952,
jones
had
not
yet
joined
the
conspiracy.
now
my
learned
friend
in
his
reply
brief
charges
me,
he
says
that
i
have
read
that
language
out
of
context.
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
you
read
it,
you
will
find
that
i
did
not
read
it
out
of
context,
but
i'll
go
further.
i
made
that
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
mr.
lane
was
there
and
mr.
lane
never
said
that
i
spoke
anything
out
of
context
with
respect
to
that.
he
did
not
say
i
misunderstood
him.
this
was
an
admission
that
down
to
that
time
there
were
no
conspiracy.
the
next
date
of
significance
is
1955,
that's
the
date
when
the
consortium
is
put
together,
but
we
have
it
in
this
record
that
in
1954
the
representative
of
cities
service
went
down
to
washington
and
pleaded
and
argued
against
the
so
called
conspiracy.
they
told
herbert
c.
hoover,
then
the
assistant
or
under
secretary
of
state
that
the
consortium
idea
was
antithetical
to
non
monopolistic
practices
in
the
oil
industry
and
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
create
it
and
that
what
they
ought
to
do
is
open
it
wide
open
and
they
fought
for
that,
certainly
none
anti-conspiratorial
conflict.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
as
i
said
the
secretary
of
state
appointed
price
waterhouse,
a
company
to
examine
applicants
into
the
consortium
and
cities
was
one
of
the
applicants
and
they
came
out
with
a
report
and
said
they
were
qualified
to
enter
it,
but
they
were
entitled
to
forty
five
hundreds
a
percent
of
1%
of
the
supply,
and
the
cities
service
said
they
wouldn't
be
bothered
with
that.
they
turned
that
over
to
richfield
oil
company
and
i
think
richfield
did
it.
the
majors
that
we
talk
about
here
got
30%
of
the
total
consortium
allotment
under
that
consortium
arrangement.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
cities
service
at
that
time
is
a
minority
stock
holder
of
richfield,
that
is
true.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
never
joined
and
has
never
been
a
member
of
it.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
cities
service
has
not
richfield.
richfield
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
split
off
from
cities
service
and
joined
with
atlantic
oil.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
that
was
another
case
in
california.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
well
i
just
haven't
got
the
fact.
now
i
don't
know
whether
i
mentioned
the
fact
but
i
should
mention
the
fact,
we
had
nine
arguments
before
judge
herlands
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
in
order
but
in
the
second
circuit
at
least
we
regard
him
as
one
of
the
most
painstaking
judges.
he
denied
me
the
motion
on
the
first
argument.
he
said
because
of
the
highly
restricted
policy
in
the
second
circuit,
and
he
later
said
on
the
record,
i
should
have
granted
it
then.
indeed
he
said
i
should
have
perhaps
stricken
the
complaint
because
once
the
basis
for
the
allegation
evaporated
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
really
should
have
withdrawn
his
signature
to
the
complaint
under
the
rule
of
11.
but
he
said
as
a
matter
of
policy
not
of
logic
he
said
so,
i
allow
them
to
have
some
examination.
when
he
used
the
power
under
the
56(d)
to
interrogate
counsel,
counsel
told
him
that
he
thought
he
was
entitled
to
have
an
antitrust
case
based
on
suspicion
alone.
he
said
he
thought
that's
the
way
antitrust
cases
should
be
initiated
on
suspicion
and
he
thought,
that
once
he
was
able
to
utter
the
words,
did
cities
service
join
the
conspiracy,
that
was
that.
i
want
to
take
the
last
minute
or
two
i
have
to
refer
to
one
thing
about
which
i
feel
very
badly.
as
reference
made
in
this
brief
the
conversations
between
jones
and
a
man
named
sandberg
in
amsterdam.
the
facts
are,
the
record
shows
that
sandberg
a
very
large
and
substantial
stockholder
of
cities
service,
a
resident
of
amsterdam
was
jones'
host
on
the
way
from
new
york
to
iran,
he
stopped
off
in
amsterdam
and
did
all
on
the
way
back
and
the
following
occurred.
at
the
ebt,
examination
before
trial
of
mr.
watson
then
the
chairman
of
the
board
or
the
retired
chairman
of
the
board.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
mr.
--
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
said
to
mr.
watson,
i
have
just
discovered
that
sandberg
is
a
member
of
the
finance
committee
of
shell
oil
and
then,
and
this
was
off
the
record
before
we
met,
and
it
is
now
in
our
affidavit.
then
he
begins
his
questioning,
he
says,
“did
you
know
that
sandberg
was
a
member
of
the
shell
oil
finance
committee?”
he
says,
“i
know
it
now.
i
don't
know
when
i
learned
it
first,”
he
is
a
man
then
in
his
early
70s.
we
then
investigated
the
matter
and
found
that
there
was
utterly
no
basis
for
to
sandberg
file
his
affidavit
that
we
never
had
anything
to
do
with
shell.
we
told
that
to
mr.
lane.
mr.
lane
says
i
am
going
to
investigate.
this
was
in
november
1964,
three
years
ago.
there
hasn't
been
one
scintilla
since
then
to
contradict
what
we
said,
but
i
find
it
referred
to
in
this
brief
and
to
that
i
would
like
to
take
exception.
