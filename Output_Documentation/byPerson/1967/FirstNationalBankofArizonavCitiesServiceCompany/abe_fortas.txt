justice
abe
fortas
are
they
still
in
the
action?
justice
abe
fortas
are
they
all
respondents
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
happened
to
the
rest
of
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
the
rest
of
the
case
is
pending
and
this
--
so
what
you
have
to
do,
am
i
correct
in
assuming
on
what
you
have
to
do
here
is
to
make
a
case
for
relief
that
you
seek
against
cities
service
itself.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
on
what
point
it
appears
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
of
whom?
justice
abe
fortas
the
plaintiff
overheard
this
or?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
--
was
mr.
wetzel
ever
called
as
witness?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
contraverted?
justice
abe
fortas
by
cities
service
in
any
way?
justice
abe
fortas
or
is
that
you
want
us
to
take
that
as
incontrverted
statement
to
this
point
in
the
litigation?
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
the
cities
service
employee
presumably
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
if
that
a
cities
service
employee
has
said
that
the
major
oil
company
said
to
cities
service,
said
to
mr.
jones
of
cities
service
you
get
the
iranian
oil
first,
if
you
don't
let
them
get
any
from
us?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
there
some
general
rule
in
new
york
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
with
respect
to
taking
depositions
as
between
the
plaintiff
and
defendant?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
was
that
rule?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
it,
but
that
was
a
rule
and
that
was
a
rule
that
governed
this
case
and
it
said
if
the
defendant
serves
notice
first
then
the
defendant
goes
into
completion.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
was
a
rule
that
was
invoked
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
your
fact,
and
i
understand
your
fact
and--
justice
abe
fortas
--the
application
here
and,
so
that
there
wasn't
any
special
rule
devised
just
for
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
your
position
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
sorry,
but
i
think
we
haven't
had
--
because
of
the
change
in
order
of
the
cases
and
then
the
time
we
spend
on
these
briefs,
did
you
take
any
--
did
you
have
any
pretrial
discovery
at
all,
did
the
plaintiff
have
any
pretrial
discovery
at
all?
justice
abe
fortas
well
as
of
the
time
that
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed
by
the
defendant,
did
you
have,
you
had
no
pretrial
discovery?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
that
what's
you're
going
to
tell
us
about
now?
justice
abe
fortas
judge
rifkind
i
take
it
you
don't
quarrel
with
the
proposition
on
law,
that's
the
first
of
the
rules
for
summary
judgment
has
a
burden
of
showing
that
are
no
material
issues
of
fact?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
of
course,
what
you're
saying
is
that
was
satisfied
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
beg
your
pardon
judge
rifkind.
i
don't
quite
understand
the
end
of
that
last
point.
is
mr.
kelly's
point
that
the
–
his
access
to
depositions
was
cut
off
prematurely
and
is
your
answer
to
it
that
he
willed
only
under
rule
56(f)
and
that
he
exhausted
the
deposition
taking
the
process
under
56(f)?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
order
added
at
any
time
that
terminated
his
opportunity
to
take
additional
depositions
under
56(f)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
did
they
ever
join
it?
justice
abe
fortas
cities
service
has
not
acquired
richfield,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
ever
notice
his
deposition?
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
a
stay?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
move
that
you
would
be
allowed
to
examine
him,
is
anything--?
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
anything
beyond
those
statements?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
didn't
sound
like
an
application
to
me,
it
sounded
like
statement
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
make
an
application
that
you
be
allowed
to
examine
jones?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
one
of
the
things
to
which
you
referred?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
your
position
is
that's
an
application
for
leave
to
take
jones'
deposition,
i
understand
your
position,
but
it
sounded
like
to
me.
