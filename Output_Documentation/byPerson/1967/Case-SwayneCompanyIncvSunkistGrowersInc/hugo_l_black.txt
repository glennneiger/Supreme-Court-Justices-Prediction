logic

what
you

is
that
congress

justice

maybe
something

justice

may
i
ask
you
whether,
is
there's
any
difference
between
you
and
your
brother,
with
reference
to
the
point
he
stressed
most
vigorously,
that
is
that
your
clients
are
not
growers
and
that
they
do
constitute

do
business
on
15%
of
the
oranges
grown.
justice

but
are
they
growers
at

justice

well
it
does

the
issue
is
kind
of
presented

is
it
not
that

whether
the

cooperative
associating
can
be
composed

justice

you
don't
want
the
grower
to
be
in
the

predicament
as
the
citizen
here,
if
we
got
to
move
to
another
congressional
district,
it's
a
different
problem.
justice
hugo

let
us
say
that
in
your
collision
with
chief
justice,
it's
been
rather
to
me
before
you
constantly
said
that
that
is
not
the
case
now.
those
are
not
the
facts
now.
but
isn't
one
of
the
objects

the
anti

act

prevent
the

that
they

that
if
it
be
proved
that
the
ownership
or
whatever
the
relationship
is,
a
15%
of
those
who
are
non-growers
might
tend
to
do
what
the
chief
apprehends,
would
that
not
be
a
reason
for
stopping

that's
saying

it
