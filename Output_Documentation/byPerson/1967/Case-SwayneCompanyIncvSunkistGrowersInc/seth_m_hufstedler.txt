mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
permission
this
morning
i
should
first
of
all
like
to
talk
about
a
matter
of
two
terminology
and
then
perhaps
briefly
review
the
sunkist
system
and
its
units
before
we
go
forward
with
some
of
the
more
complicated
questions
of
the
membership
within
the
system.
i
was
interested
to
note
in
mr.
henderson's
opening
remarks
that
he
referred
to
the
petitioner
herein
as
a
small
packer
and
the
sunkist
as
the
dominant
combination
marketing
citrus
fruit.
i
suppose
we
could
easily
get
into
a
battle
of
adjectives
and
i
think
if
we
have
to
fight
about
dominative,
sunkist
could
probably
do
very
well
in
that
battle,
because
we
represent
the
small
grower
who
has
a
backyard
full
of
citrus
trees,
who
has
two
or
three
acres
as
well
as
the
larger
growers
who
are
large
enough
to
pack
their
own
fruit
in
their
own
packing
houses.
but
we
do
not
feel
this
is
basically
a
question
of
who
is
bigger
than
whom
or
who
is
smaller
than
whom.
we
believe
we
are
dealing
here
as
the
court
indicated
in
the
winckler
case
with
a
question
of
substance.
what
is
the
economic
effect
of
this
membership
that
the
petitioner
complains
about
and
is
there
something
proscribed
about
that
membership
or
about
the
effect
it
has
in
the
capper-volstead
act?
i
think
one
other
question
of
terminology
should
be
examined.
mr.
henderson
pointed
out
that
although
the
stipulation
which
both
parties
signed
described
these
associations
as
agency
associations
he
doesn't
now
like
that
term.
he
wants
to
call
them
commercial
packing
houses
and
of
course
he
may
define
his
terms
in
any
sense
he
prefers
here.
but
to
me
and
to
the
orange
industry
the
term
commercial
packing
house
means
something
different
and
i
think
it
points
out
precisely
what
this
litigation
is
about.
a
commercial
packing
house
to
me
means
an
individual
business
enterprise
which
buys
up
fruit.
generally
speaking
that
enterprise
will
go
out
to
the
farmer,
he
will
look
at
his
growth
and
he
will
by
the
fruit
on
the
tree,
often
perhaps
in
advance
as
a
hedge
against
a
free
use
or
something
of
that
sort
and
the
packer
then
owns
that
fruit,
it's
his
and
he
may
now
speculate
on
the
market.
he
can
hope
to
hold
it
at
a
time
when
the
market
will
bring
a
higher
price
for
that
fruit
and
whatever
price
he
gets
for
that
fruit
is
his.
he
no
longer
owes
the
grower
a
cent,
other
than
purchase
price
that
he
buys.
now
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
middleman
which
the
capper-volstead
act
was
aimed
at.
the
man
who
had
money
in
his
pocket,
who
could
go
out
and
buy
the
farmer's
product
and
then
he
could
speculate
on
what
he
could
make
on
that
product.
that's
the
flouring
mills
that
have
been
referred
to
in
the
legislative
history
mr.
henderson
talks
about
and
that
to
us
is
a
commercial
packing
house.
stipulation
here
is
crystal
clear.
there
is
no
commercial
packing
house
in
the
sunkist
system
in
that
sense.
the
stipulation
points
out
on
pages
36
and
37
of
the
record
that
all
of
the
economic
benefit
of
the
sunkist
system
returns
to
the
grower,
through
these
agency
associations.
the
agency
association
has
no
gain
or
loss
because
of
the
increased
price
if
any
or
the
lesser
price
if
any,
because
of
marketing
to
the
sunkist
system.
he
has
a
fixed
contract
for
a
fixed
return.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
does
indeed
make
a
profit.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct
your
honor,
that's
correct.
now
that
profit
is
a
profit
which
it
makes
at
a
fixed
fee
which
is
specified
in
it's
contract.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it's
a
contract
with
each
grower
your
honor.
the
--
each
agency
association
maintains
a
contract
with
an
individual
grower,
so
there
are
only
two
parties
to
the
contract.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
generally
speaking.
there
are
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
generally
not.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
we
talk
briefly
about
the
sunkist
system,
but
before
departing
from
this
point,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
when
i
refer
to
a
commercial
packing
house,
i
am
talking
about
a
packing
house
which
buys
the
fruit
and
thereafter
owns
it
and
receives
all
the
benefit
of
the
sale.
the
agency
associations
as
we
refer
to
them
are
a
distinct
kind
of
operation
and
they
are
packing
fruit
where
the
returns
of
the
proceeds
go
back
to
the
grower.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
there
is
a
very
substantial
dispute
with
respect
to
who
our
parties
are
and
who
in
the
real
sense
are
the
members
of
the
sunkist
system.
i
do
not
dispute
the
fact
and
it
is
stipulated
that
the
persons
who
own
the
agency
houses
which
amount
to
about
15%
of
the
fruit
in
the
sunkist
system,
are
not
necessarily
growers.
the
stipulation
says
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
stipulation
says
specifically
some
of
them
have
been,
some
of
them
are
not.
in
other
words
there
are
some
agency
houses
within
the
system.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
a
little
of
both
your
honor
and
let
me
read
the
stipulation.
the
stipulation
with
respect
to
these
two
matters,
which
both
of
these
last
questions
are
addressed
to
appears
at
page
35
of
the
record
and
it
says
first
that
agency
associations
constitute
14.9%
by
number
and
12.9%
by
volume
of
the
associations
within
the
system.
now
more
specifically
about
13%
of
the
oranges
which
are
marketed
through
sunkist
come
into
the
system
through
an
agency
association.
if
you
count
the
number
of
packing
houses,
roughly
a
120
in
the
system,
well
about
15%
of
them
are
agency
associations.
more
specifically
with
respect
to
fruit
growing
mr.
justice
black,
that
provides
about
four
pages
--
about
six
lines
from
the
bottom.
some
have
been
fruit
growers
and
some
have
not
been
fruit
growers.
we
do
not
here
claim
that
all
of
the
agency
associations
are
fruit
growers,
but
some
of
them
certainly
have
been.
now
that's
not
a
point
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
we
may
have
in
the
form
in
which
we
have
them
in
sunkist,
an
agency
association
as
a
corporate
member
of
sunkist
growers
incorporated,
which
is
not
a
grower
of
the
fruit.
now
you
will
note
that
i
draw
the
distinction
between
the
member
of
the
sunkist
system
as
a
whole
and
the
technical
membership
as
a
corporate
member
of
sunkist
growers
incorporated.
these
are
different
unities
in
my
view
and
i'll
come
to
that
point
in
a
moment,
but
that's
only
one
of
the
many
unities
and
structures
in
sunkist
grower
system
as
a
whole.
let's
take
a
look
at
the
system,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
a
little
bit
more
about
how
sunkist
operates
and
what
these
various
structures
do.
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
facts
i'm
now
going
to
discuss
on
what
the
plaintiff
says
as
it's
critical
issue
are
actually
quite
different
for
the
two
halves
of
this
lawsuit,
because
as
i
understand
the
plaintiff's
position
is
a
very
simple
one.
the
agency
association
is
a
member
of
sunkist
growers,
therefore
per
se,
that
terminates
the
question
on
exemption.
that
wasn't
true
as
a
fact,
when
this
lawsuit
was
filed
and
is
not
true
for
about
half
of
the
period
covered
by
the
lawsuit.
the
complaint
was
filed
in
this
lawsuit
on
april
15,
1958,
seeking
damages
for
three
years.
a
supplemental
complaint
was
filed
in
june
1962
adding
almost
an
additional
four
years
to
january
1962.
so
we
cover
a
period
of
little
less
than
seven
years.
on
october
31,
1958
various
changes
were
made
in
the
sunkist
structure.
so
for
a
period
now
about
three
and
a
half
years
to
start
with,
we
have
a
different
fact
situation,
from
the
second
period
of
a
little
less
than
three
and
a
half
years.
now
let
me
tell
you
first
about
the
first
half
of
this
lawsuit
and
then
what
the
changes
were
for
the
second
half
of
the
lawsuit.
as
you
now
know,
sunkist
is
basically
a
pyramidal
structure,
it's
built
on
a
principle
of
representation.
we
have
at
the
base
as
the
record
says
some
12,000
growers,
actually
the
number
of
growers
in
california
are
decreasing;
subdivisions,
increased
property
taxes
are
cutting
down
the
production
of
oranges.
but
nevertheless
the
growers
at
the
base
and
the
grower
on
an
individual
non-cooperative
basis
produces
his
own
fruit
up
to
the
point
of
picking.
generally
speaking
the
sunkist
system
or
the
packing
house
has
nothing
to
do
with
raising
the
fruit.
they
have
research
assistants.
they
may
do
--
provide
some
assistance
with
respect
to
problems
of
growing,
but
that's
an
individual
problem
for
the
grower.
when
he
brings
his
fruit
to
the
point
where
it's
ready
to
picked,
generally
the
packing
house
picks
it.
now
it
may
on
occasion
not
be
picked
by
the
packing
house,
but
it
is
then
brought
to
a
packing
house.
at
the
packing
house
the
physical
handing
of
the
fresh
fruit
for
marketing
takes
place.
now
bear
in
mind
this
lawsuit
is
for
product
fruit
and
therefore
i
mentioned
fresh
fruit
only
in
passing
because
it
does
tie
into
the
structure
of
sunkist.
but
the
packing
house
function
is
a
function
dealing
with
fresh
fruit
primarily.
there
the
fruit
is
sorted,
it's
washed,
it's
graded,
it's
packed
and
when
it's
sold
it's
shipped
directly
from
the
packing
house
to
the
ultimate
purchaser,
it
doesn't
go
to
any
other
sunkist
facility.
when
however
a
decision
is
made
that
the
fruit
is
to
be
product
grouped,
for
whatever
reason,
it
probably
is
already
at
the
packing
house,
it
may
still
be
at
the
farm.
but
when
that
decision
is
made,
the
fruit
is
moved
directly
to
the
processing
facilities
of
sunkist
and
it
may
never
go
to
the
packing
house
or
it
may
be
there
only
briefly
and
go
to
sunkist.
and
it
is
at
the
processing
facilities
of
sunkist
known
generally
as
exchange
orange,
where
the
fruit
is
juiced,
it's
processed
into
either
concentrated
juice
or
however
it's
sold.
it
maybe
sold
as
chilled
juice,
it
maybe
sold
into
various
peeled
products,
it
maybe
sold
peeled
products
as
fertilizer
or
various
pharmaceuticals,
whatever
product
is
built
from
it.
when
product
fruit
--
the
product
that
is
then
made
or
perhaps
i
should
go
back
a
step,
the
determination
as
to
whether
that
fruit
will
be
sold
perhaps
a
whole
fruit
to
a
processor
or
will
be
processed
into
a
particular
product
is
made
by
sunkist,
it's
not
made
by
the
packing
house.
sunkist
also
makes
the
determination
where
it
will
be
sold,
when
it
will
sold,
what
the
price
will
be,
and
who
the
purchaser
is.
as
you
can
appreciate
the
fruit
from
mini
growers
is
pooled
in
this
kind
of
a
process
and
therefore
an
accounting
is
kept
on
the
quality
of
the
fruit
which
comes
in,
the
percentage
of
solids
that
the
fruit
has,
so
the
grower
can
be
fairly
paid
and
when
sunkist
has
a
return,
the
return
is
paid
back
first
to
the
packing
house
on
product
fruit.
the
packing
house
in
turn
under
the
agreement
determines
which
of
its
growers
brought
that
fruit
into
sunkist.
the
packing
house
deducts
its
fixed
fee
and
its
costs
and
returns
the
net
proceeds
of
operation
back
to
the
grower.
now
in
terms
of
the
formal
organization
of
sunkist,
the
grower
signs
the
contract,
which
is
attached
as
exhibit
b
to
the
stipulation,
if
he
is
dealing
with
an
agency
association.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
handling
of
the
fruits
is
identical.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
is
identical
with
one
exception.
so
far
as
the
operating
funds
are
concerned,
sunkist
operates
on
the
basis
of
revolving
funds,
so
that
from
product
fruit
an
amount
not
to
exceed
$0.50
a
tonne
is
withheld
as
a
revolving
fund.
as
it's
paid
in,
it's
paid
back
out
to
the
people
who
first
had
that
deduction
made
and
that
means
in
effect
that
a
growers
gets
back
all
of
his
money
now
except
this
assessment
and
about
six
or
seven
years
later
he
gets
back
that
small
amount
which
operates
as
sunkist's
operating
capital.
now
that
applies
uniformly
across
the
board.
if
however
the
grower
is
dealing
through
a
cooperative
association
and
you
are
aware
i
am
sure
that
about
80%
of
the
sunkist
fruit
comes
in
through
cooperatives,
the
cooperative
will
also
have
a
similar
arrangement
for
paying
its
capital
costs,
so
that
it
generally
will
have
either
a
capital
contribution
or
a
revolving
fund.
when
the
fund
is
paid
back
from
sunkist
to
a
cooperative,
it
will
deduct
its
capital
charge
and
then
return
the
proceeds
after
its
costs,
return
its
proceeds
to
the
grower.
when
the
funds
come
back
to
the
agency
association,
instead
of
deducting
the
capital
fund
it
deducts
its
charges.
in
other
words,
to
put
the
situation
i
think
simply
in
effect
the
grower
and
the
agency
association
is
running
the
facilities
and
paying
a
rental
today
for
the
services
he
gets.
the
grower
who
uses
a
cooperative
does
it
on
an
amortizing
basis
where
he
participates
in
a
revolving
fund
and
must
maintain
a
part
of
the
capital
to
maintain
those
facilities
and
the
end
result
of
this
for
the
grower
you
can
see
is
a
substantial
advantage.
it
means
the
growers
has
two
choices
instead
of
one.
instead
of
getting
into
a
cooperative
where
he
must
commit
his
capital
to
maintain
the
packing
house
facilities,
he
may
pay
it
on
a
current
basis,
a
rental
type
basis.
instead
of
my
building
the
house,
i'll
have
you
build
it
and
i'll
pay
you
so
much
a
year
out
of
the
fruit
that
goes
through
it.
now
of
course
as
you
also
aware
both
the
contract
here
which
is
set
up
as
between
the
grower
and
the
agency
association
and
each
of
the
units
in
the
sunkist
have
the
right
every
year
to
terminate
that
relationship.
so
that
if
the
grower
doesn't
like
the
amount
that
he
is
having
to
pay
to
this
agency
association
he
can
terminate
it
at
the
end
of
any
year
in
addition
to
the
escape
clause
which
was
mentioned
few
moments
ago
and
this
serves
a
very
healthy
purpose
within
the
system.
as
i've
indicated
we
have
the
order
of
the
120
packing
houses.
if
you've
ever
driven
through
the
oranges
growers,
orange
district
of
southern
california
and
gone
into
a
little
town
such
as
redlands
or
san
bernardino
or
orange
and
gone
down
by
the
railroad
track,
you'll
see
lined
up
one
after
the
other
orange
packing
houses,
agency
house,
a
cooperative,
a
cooperative,
an
agency
house,
and
if
you
are
a
grower
you
can
walk
into
any
one
of
those
and
sign
them
up
for
next
year
and
if
you
don't
like
the
fees
in
one
house
and
you
don't
like
the
way
you
are
getting
paid
you
have
a
good
healthy
competition
between
them
or
if
you
think
an
agency
--
if
you
think
the
cooperative
can
serve
you
better,
you
can
walk
next
door
and
have
your
fruit
delivered
to
a
cooperative.
after
you
get
your
fruit
on
a
truck,
it's
only
a
question
of
30
or
40
minutes
on
a
good
highway
to
dozens
of
packing
houses
within
your
area.
so
we
have
a
healthy
competition
between
the
packing
houses
that
means
an
additional
service
and
benefit
to
grower.
now
let
me
go
back
to
the
formal
organization
of
sunkist.
we
know
now
how
they
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
not
entirely
your
honor.
sunkist
serves
an
area
up
into
the
san
joaquin
valley.
as
you
know
the
large
orange
growing
areas
are
centered
between
say
redlands
and
down
into
orange
county,
but
there
are
oranges
into
san
diego,
there
are
citrus
product
--
there
is
citrus
production
in
the
coachella
valley
and
there
are
now
large
new
growers
being
planted
in
the
san
joaquin
valley,
largely
navels
for
the
fresh
fruit
market,
however
navels
don't
process
very
well
and
there
are
packing
houses
in
that
area.
so
you
are
quite
correct
your
honor
there
is
a
concentration
in
southern
california,
but
there
are
outlying
areas
and
there
are
i
believe
eight
or
nine
houses
in
arizona.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes,
your
honor.
now
let's
go
back
to
the
formal
structure.
we
know
now
that
the
growers
are
in
the
packing
houses
and
one
of
these
three
kinds
of
relations,
an
agency
association,
a
cooperative
or
they
may
have
their
own
packing
house
which
they've
built.
they
are
then
organized
into
district
exchanges.
historically
the
stipulation
points
out
how
the
district
exchanges
grew
as
the
first
unit
of
development
to
bring
them
together
in
their
market.
the
associations
are
members
of
the
district
exchanges.
they
are
non-profit
cooperative
membership
associations.
the
packing
houses
elect
the
representatives
to
the
district
exchanges.
looking
now
at
the
first
half
of
this
lawsuit.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
district
exchange
during
the
first
half
of
the
lawsuit
your
honor,
each
nominated
a
person
who
became
the
member
of
sunkist
growers
incorporated
and
who
served
on
the
board
of
directors.
now
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question
a
few
moments
ago,
sunkist
is
in
fact
run
by
a
board
of
directors.
sunkist
is
a
corporation.
it's
a
nonprofit
membership
corporation.
its
members
and
its
board
of
directors
were
identical
in
the
first
half
of
this
lawsuit,
approximately
17
individuals
each
nominated
by
a
district
exchange.
they
determine
the
policy
of
sunkist
and
equally
important
they
hire
the
principal
employees,
the
economists
who
are
necessary
for
examination
of
the
market,
the
statisticians
or
the
general
manager
right
on
down
the
line.
so
sunkist
is
operated
in
effect
by
that
board
of
directors.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
growers
have
never
been
called
members
of
sunkist.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
still
they
are
not.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
your
honor,
during
the
first
half
of
the
lawsuit,
the
only
members
were
approximately
17
individuals.
now
bear
in
mind
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
you
honor.
now
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
articles
of
by
laws
and
in
some
of
the
passages
there
are
indications
that
maybe
the
member
was
really
the
district
exchange,
but
the
individuals
are
called
the
members.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
quite
possibly
they
were
not.
this
was
the
initial
position
which
the
petitioners
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
now
i
think
perhaps
now
is
the
time
to
answer
that
question
directly
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
certainly.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
cooperatives
are
members
of
the
district
association--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
that's
correct.
all
120
packing
houses
approximately
each
are
members
of
agencies.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct
or
whether
an
individual
grower
who
has
his
own
packing
house.
now
let's
go
back
to
this
question
which
justice
fortas
has
asked
because
this
is
--
it
seems
to
me
precisely
the
problem
we
are
dealing
with
here.
what
is
a
member
that
we
are
talking
about,
what's
the
critical
sense
of
member
in
this
litigation?
i
haven't
been
talking
about
members
of
the
sunkist
system
or
the
member
of
the
cooperative
at
all
in
my
sense
of
the
word
and
yet
i
think
what
i
have
said
the
impression
you
have
is
yes
we
are
talking
about
the
same
members.
i
am
talking
about
a
corporate
structure.
sunkist
growers
incorporated
is
a
nonprofit
corporation.
for
its
purposes
and
its
by
laws
its
corporate
members
are
designated
to
certain
people
and
they
come
through
a
representative
system.
they
do
and
they
did
during
half
of
the
lawsuit.
now
i
don't
think
when
we
talk
about
the
capper-volstead
cooperative
or
the
capper-volstead
qualification
we're
necessarily
talking
about
that
member
at
all,
who
we
call
a
member
in
our
bylaws
as
a
matter
of
corporate
technical
structure
of
the
organization.
when
we
talk
about
the
sunkist
system
as
a
whole
now,
this
court
has
already
said
in
winckler
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
unified
organization
the
sunkist
system.
now
let's
set
apart
for
a
moment
the
sunkist
system
over
here
as
a
whole
and
sunkist
growers
incorporated,
a
nonprofit
corporation
which
sits
at
the
apex
of
that
pyramidal
structure,
who
are
the
members
of
the
sunkist
system?
well
i
would
suggest
to
you
members
of
the
sunkist
system
are
those
people
who
have
its
beneficial
interest.
it
obviously,
if
i
am
permitted
to
get
a
substantial
portion
of
the
profit
that
this
entire
marketing
system
is
making,
i
can't
escape
the
consequences
of
that
by
not
calling
myself
a
member.
conversely
if
i
don't
call
myself
a
member
certainly
i
am
one
of
the
people
who
is
a
member.
and
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
in
looking
at
this
pyramidal
structure
now,
for
purposes
of
capper-volstead
the
people
who
have
the
benefit
of
this
system
are
the
growers,
because
they
receive
every
cent
that
the
sunkist
system
has
expect
for
costs
with
the
one
qualification
of
the
area
we
have
talked
about,
they
pay
a
rental
and
fixed
fee
to
the
agency
association,
but
that's
not
a
participation
in
the
variables
from
marketing,
that's
a
negotiated
fee
for
the
their
services.
and
so
every
cent
of
their
operation
filters
back
down
to
the
grower
and
therefore
i
would
suggest
to
you
when
we
talk
about
the
capper-volstead
act,
that
we're
talking
about
the
grower
as
the
member,
even
though
we
do
not
issue
a
membership
certificate
to
him
and
even
though
the
man
who
holds
a
membership
certificate
in
the
corporation,
sunkist
growers
incorporated,
may
now
be
an
agency
association.
now
that
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
your
honor
and
let
me
cite
to
you
the
language
of
capper-volstead
act
specifically.
it
says,
the
first
sentence,
the
50
word
sentence
mr.
henderson
has
talked
about
says
that
farmers
may
act
together
in
associations
and
it
then
says
corporate
or
otherwise,
now
corporate
obviously
requires
stock,
corporate
or
otherwise,
with
or
without
capital
stock
and
that's
broad
authorizing
language.
they
can
act
in
corporations
or
not
and
they
can
have
stock
or
not.
now
the
qualifications
down
below
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
sir,
its
quite
a
bit
your
honor,
quite
a
bit.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
there
are
two
clauses
that
follow
that
which
we
believe
are
critical
to
the
capper-volstead
act.
the
second
sentence
says,
such
associations
may
have
marketing
agencies
in
common.
now
the
marketing
agencies
obviously
are
someone
outside
the
grower
realm
who
they
may
employ
to
market
their
fruit.
going
on,
and
such
associations
and
their
members
may
make
the
necessary
contracts
and
agreements
to
affect
such
purposes,
so
that
they
also
have
the
power
to
contend
and
may
i
point
out
the
first
time
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
will
your
honor.
that's
followed
by
a
colon,
provided
however,
that
associations
are
operated
for
the
mutual
benefit
of
the
members
thereof
as
such
producers.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
as
such
producers
and
conform
to
one
or
both
of
the
following
requirements.
and
then
you
remember
there
are
two
alternate
requirements,
either
no
member
is
allowed
more
than
one
vote
because
of
the
amount
of
stock
he
has
or
membership
capital
he
has
contributed
or
the
association
doesn't
pay
dividends
in
excess
of
8%.
and
then
in
any
case
the
following,
which
is
the
last
requirement,
that
the
association
shall
not
deal
in
the
products
of
non-members
to
an
amount
greater
in
value
than
such
as
are
handled
for
its
members.
now
that's
the
complete
statute.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
then
are
handled
for
its
members.
the
last
clause
is
important
mr.
justice
black
because
it
says
that
the
association
may
have
non
member
fruit
and
sometime
ago
mr.
justice
black
asked
--
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
mr.
henderson,
what
would
happen
if
we
simply
excluded
all
of
the
agency
associations,
wouldn't
we
reach
the
result
just
by
marketing
their
fruit?
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
the
result
here
is
one
that
can
clearly
be
reached
under
the
non-membership
fruit.
let's
suppose
we
said
alright
agency
associations
go
out,
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
them,
but
we'll
market
your
fruit
for
you
and
we'll
call
you
non-members,
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
association
but
we
will
market
your
fruit
for
you.
this
paragraph
says
that
we
can
market
fruit
in
as
large
an
amount
as
we
already
are
marketing
by
acquiring
it
from
non-members
and
this
is
dealing
only
with
14
or
15%
or
actually
13%
of
the
fruit
in
the
system.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
could
we
agree
with
the
outsider
that
he
wouldn't?
i
would
think
not
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
attempt
to
do
it.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
that
would
be
inappropriate,
but
let
me
suggest
the
answer
to
it.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
would
say
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
would
say
you'd
have
to
divide
up
your
groups
of
members
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well
i'm
going
to
try
to
answer
that
but
i
think
you
can't
answer
it
until
you
tell
me
who
the
member
is,
who
is
applying.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
if
we're
taking
the
identical
packer
i
would
say
yes,
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
and
the
reason,
there
is
no
question
that
we
could
market
all
of
these
fruit
and
that
we
could
--
whether
he
is
himself
a
grower
or
not,
we
could
tie
him
to
the
identical
contract
we
have
now.
the
reason
being
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
i
believe
we
could
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
subject
to
the
qualification
that
you
haven't
permitted
me
to
state
yet,
which
i
now
will
state.
and
that
is,
that,
that
agency
with
whom
we
are
dealing,
returns
all
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
to
his
growers,
i
think
as
long
as
the
growers
receive
that
benefit,
we
can
make
the
arrangement
until
all
of
the
growers
producing
that
product
are
involved
in
the
system.
now
that's
the
key.
if
this
man
is
what
mr.
henderson
calls
a
commercial
packing
house,
so
that
he
goes
out
and
buys
his
own
fruit,
no,
i
don't
think
we
can
make
that
kind
of
an
arrangement
with
him,
i
certainly
would
not
suggest
it.
we're
obviously
not
dealing
with
that
situation
here.
but
the
capper-volstead
act
says
that
associations
of
growers
may
have
marketing
agencies
in
common
and
i
don't
think
you
would
argue
with
the
proposition
that
we
can
have
cooperative
a,
which
has
a
marketing
agent
and
we
have
cooperative
b
which
has
a
marketing
agent
and
those
two
marketing
agents
in
common
can
represent
the
associations,
because
the
statute
says
we
can
have
associations
in
common.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
your
honor
i
would
say
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
would
say
that
provision
with
respect
to
no
member
having
one
vote
illustrates
just
the
opposite,
that
it
does
contemplate
non-grower
members
and
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
or
let
me
put
it
this
way.
perhaps
we
are
going
to
draw
a
distinction
here
and
it
maybe
appropriate
between
members
and
stockholders.
but
it
is
apparent
that
first
of
all
the
senate
particularly
looked
carefully
at
the
raisin
growers
association
and
they
found
first
of
all
that
the
raisin
growers
had
non-grower
stockholders.
there
are
about
2,400
grower
stockholders
there
were
about
800
non-grower
stockholders.
so
roughly
about
a
quarter
of
the
stockholders
were
non-growers.
they
also
had
in
their
bylaws
however
that
they
could
not
pay
dividends
more
than
8%,
that's
apparently
where
this
came
from.
so
they
contemplated
that
here
was
an
association
with
non-grower
stockholders
who
could
participate
in
both
their
stock
but
that
they
were
limited
to
an
8%
return
on
their
capital.
now
i
think
the
key
also
maybe
found
in
the
phrase,
which
talks
about
what
we
believe
to
be
the
fundamental
test
of
capper-volstead,
and
that
is
provided
however
this
is
the
test
to
our
way
of
thinking
of
the
validity
of
capper-volstead
qualification,
provided
however
that
such
associations
are
operated
for
the
mutual
benefit
of
the
members
thereof
as
such
producers.
now
why
would
the
qualification
as
such
producers
be
necessary?
if
those
members
didn't
have
some
standing,
some
status
other
than
as
a
producer,
the
producers,
the
non-producers
are
limited
now
with
respect
to
that
next
requirement,
to
the
extent
of
their
capital
requirement
they
can
get
only
8%
on
their
investments.
but
they're
shareholders,
they
can
participate,
they
have
a
membership
status
in
effect,
but
they're
limited
to
an
8%
return
and
thereafter
all
of
the
benefit
of
the
operation
must
go
to
the
grower
himself
and
that's
the
principle
which
we
seek
to
live
up
to,
that's
the
principle
which
i
think
the
stipulation
clearly
shows
that
we
have
lived
up
to
in
sunkist.
we
operate
for
the
grower
and
we
return
our
benefits
to
the
grower
regardless
of
how
this
fruit
comes
into
the
system
and
we
treat
every
grower
on
an
equivalent
basis.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
contract
with
the
agency
association
your
honor
is
a
negotiated
contract.
the
grower
sits
down
and
negotiates
with
the
agency
association
on
what
he
will
charge.
if
the
grower
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
think
there
is
no
organization
that
bargains
with
it
your
honor.
i
think
it's
an
individual
bargaining
by
the
farmers
themselves
with
respect
to
costs.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
but
bear
in
mind,
this
agency
association
must
be
competitive
with
its
nearby
agency
association
and
most
give
the
same
sort
of
return
that
the
cooperatives
give.
now
frankly,
one
of
the
facts
that
agency
associations
are
able
to
compete
with
cooperatives
is
you
have
businessman
running
them
and
they're
willing
to
devote
the
12
or
18
or
20
hours
a
day
to
run
that
business
and
run
it
efficiently
and
therefore
they
can
run
as
efficiently
as
a
cooperative
organization.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
partly
correct
and
partly
wrong
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
no,
you're
quite
correct
that
they're
determining
what
their
price
will
be
with
their
farmer,
but
the
negotiation
between
the
individual
farmer
and
the
agency
association
involves
only
those
two.
now,
it
is
true,
sunkist
itself,
the
corporation
board
up
here
that
has
the
board
of
directors
running
it
has
the
right
to
call
those
contracts
in
and
review
them
and
if
they
don't
like
what's
going
on
they
can
terminate
them.
now
they
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
he
hasn't
your
honor,
not
at
all,
and
i
wouldn't
suggest
he
is.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct.
as
your
honor
well
knows
with
the
citrus
growers
in
california
and
elsewhere,
they
know
what's
going
on
in
the
business.
there
are
several
packing
houses
which
they
can
select
and
they
talk
to
the
man
next
door
who
has
two
acres.
they
can't
talk
the
agency
association
to
cutting
its
price
in
half.
but
he
can
go
to
the
agency,
a
house
next
door
or
the
cooperative
next
door
to
that
if
he
doesn't
get
a
good
price.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
would
be
a
terrible
situation
if
it
occurred
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
would
be
a
terrible
situation
that
if
it
occurred.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
first
of
all,
it
isn't
the
situation
we're
aware
of
that
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
all
right.
now
secondly
could
it
occur?
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
farmer
has
his
choice
with
respect
to
that.
the
farmer
selects
how
he's
going
to
participate
in
the
sunkist
system.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
you're
assuming
that
that's
what
the
farmer
wants,
because
it'll
only
get
that
way
if
the
farmer
wants
it
your
honor.
if
the
farmer
wants
to
say
to
the
packing
house,
you
take
all
of
my
fruit
and
market
it,
do
anything
you
want
to
do,
i
don't
want
to
see
it
again,
he
is
entitled
to
do
that
under
capper-volstead
isn't
he?
now
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
can't
answer
that
specifically
your
honor
to
say
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes,
today
as
i
stand
here,
sunkist
has
approximately
9,000
members
and
the
record
below
shows
that
we
were
handling
about
67%
of
the
product
fruit.
now,
our
membership
has
gone
down
since
that
time
and
the
product
production
has
gone
down,
but
that
will
give
you
some
general
idea
of
the
number
of
other
producers.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
particularly
in
southern
california
as
i've
said
we're
picking
up
a
few
in
the
central
valley
now,
but
let
me
go
back
to
this
question
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i'm
sorry
i
–
[laughter]
sunkist
has
9,000
growers.
we
always
consider
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
does
your
honor,
i
must
agree
that
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
sunkist
has
approximately
a
119
today.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
first
of
all
most
of
them
are
cooperative
associations.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
of
growers,
so
we'll
exclude
those
for
the
moment.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
those
are
about
80%.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
about
80%
are
cooperatives.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
we
take
out
another
roughly
5%
because
those
are
growers
who
have
their
own
packing
houses.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct
your
honor
and
they
petitioner
here
concedes,
that
sunkist
so
held,
i
mean,
that
winckler
so
held
in
their
brief.
now,
we
come
back
then
to
the
remaining
15%
by
number
approximately
which
are
agency
associations
as
we
have
descried.
our
last
review,
some
of
them
are
cooperation,
some
of
them
are
partnerships,
some
of
them
are
individual
proprietorships,
our
last
review
show
that
either
the
association
itself
or
the
stockholders
who
were
in
the
association
were
fruit
growers
except
two
or
three
situations.
but
we
still
had
as
of
the
time
we
last
looked,
at
least
one
perhaps
two,
perhaps
three,
of
these
agency
associations
who
were
not
growers.
but
let
me
suggest
that
that
is
the
fallacy
of
this
kind
of
a
test.
if
all
we're
looking
for
is
a
grower,
isn't
it
really
a
senseless
act
for
us
to
say
that
these
19%
of
these
agency
associations,
go
out
and
buy
yourself
a
couple
of
acres
of
oranges,
that
is
not
the
answer
to
our
problem.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
have
the
packing
house
have
a
acres
of
oranges
and
say
this
is
a
technical
statute,
you
got
to
be
a
grower,
now
you
are
grower
and
the
slate
is
clean,
that
isn't
our
problem.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
suppose
thought
we'd
have
to
draw
the
line
some
place,
wouldn't
we?
he
does
become
a
grower
at
some
point.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
but
let
me
come
back
to
our
central
issue,
my
time
is
running
short
and
i'll
try
to
make
two
or
three
points
rather
quickly.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
would
not
change
my
position
at
all
your
honor
so
long
as
all
the
economic
benefits
were
returning
to
the
grower.
so
long
as
the
middle
men
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
your
honor
it
wouldn't
and
let
me
put
what
seems
to
me
to
be
a
clear
example.
the
winckler
case
has
already
said
that
a
100%
of
the
--
all
of
these
growers
could
organize
into
one
association.
let's
avoid
the
membership
problem,
because
it's
that
label
that
follows
it
and
let's
suppose
we
organize
a
single
cooperative
with
12,000
growers
or
however
many
there
are,
as
the
members
and
the
cooperative
markets
the
fruit,
is
there
any
question
that
that
cooperative
now
having
a
100%
of
the
fruit
could
contract
with
all
of
the
packing
house
agencies
to
do
exactly
what
they
are
doing
now?
to
bring
the
fruit
in
from
the
grove,
to
wash
it,
to
pack
it,
to
ship
it
and
is
there
any
question
if
they
wanted
to,
those
growers
and
their
cooperative
could
say,
not
only
do
we
want
you
to
do
that
we
want
you
to
be
our
marketing
agent.
capper-volstead
says
they
can
have
a
marketing
agent.
now
essentially
every
function
that
the
agency
association
performs
is
a
clear
cooperative
legitimate
cooperative
activity.
certainly
the
washing,
packing,
sorting,
shipping,
that's
a
legitimate
activity.
the
farmers
can
hire
someone
to
do
that,
what
about
the
marketing?
well
to
the
extent
that
they
participate
in
the
marketing
that's
a
legitimate
activity.
now
if
we
could
have
those
associations
as
our
marketing
agent
and
have
them
do
everything
then
mr.
chief
justice
is
it
not
appropriate
to
say
to
those
agency
associations,
i
as
a
farmer
want
you
to
represent
me
in
this
sunkist
system,
you
are
my
representative
and
is
he
not
doing
a
great
deal
less
than
marketing
the
fruit.
now
what
are
these
terrible
things
that
these
members
in
sunkist
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes,
that
might
very
well
be
--
i
am
not,
i
am
not
sure
whether
that's
right
or
not,
but
let
me
suggest
that
is
not
the
fact
here.
we
were
talking
about
that
a
few
moments
ago
when
we
got
off
on
to
another
subject.
the
grower
selects
the
agency
association
to
represent
him,
other
growers
select
the
cooperatives.
if
i
as
a
grower
don't
want
the
agency
association
representing
me,
i
can
join
a
cooperative
and
i
can
participate
that
way
in
the
sunkist
system.
the
eventual
board
of
sunkist
is
made
up
off
those
person
elected
by
the
district
exchanges.
now
throughout
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well
there
are
now
17
or
18
your
honor,
there
is
one
association
in
process
as
a
district
exchange.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
they
are
associations
of
packing
houses
that's
correct.
now
it
is
true
that
the
agency
associations
has
a
vote
along
with
the
other
packing
houses
in
that
system
which
elects
the
representatives
to
the
district
exchange
and
then
by
further
representation
the
district
exchanges
elect
the
board
of
sunkist.
but
to
extent
that
they
are
participating
is
only
in
the
sense
that
they
are
actually
selecting
the
governing
body
of
sunkist
which
will
make
the
determinations.
now
that
body
therefore
represents
all
of
the
people
down
this
representative
structure.
a
very
small
portion
of
the
growers
of
which
have
come
through
representative
houses,
because
they
selected
them
as
their
representative.
the
contract
between
the
farmer
and
the
agency
association
is
a
competitive
contract,
it's
on
the
market,
if
he
isn't
meeting
the
competition
the
grower
won't
sign
up
with
him.
so
the
value
and
of
his
cost,
and
of
his
service
is
protected
by
the
competition
between
the
parties.
sunkist
does
not
purport
from
the
governing
board
to
tell
him
what
he
can
or
cannot
charge,
at
the
same
time
sunkist
has
the
right
to
and
does
review
these
contracts
from
time
to
time,
if
they
find
them
unfair
they
can
terminate
the
membership
of
that
individual.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
the
representatives
of
the
board.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
very
indirectly
your
honor
yes,
yes,
now
three
steps
removed
you
understand.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
think
if
they
favor
their
own
they
would
be
out
on
their
area
your
honor,
because
the
growers
control
this
organization
and
let
me
you
why.
you
are
talking
only
about
a
maximum
of
what
12.9%
of
the
fruit,
15%
by
number,
so
you
are
talking
about
15%
of
the
vote.
now
how
many
constituencies
are
dominated
by
15%
of
the
vote,
how
many
congressmen
are
elected
by
15%
of
their
vote?
the
other
85%
is
also
voting.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
oh
that's
right.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct,
i
didn't
tell
you
that
and
here
is
the
reason.
if
i
decide
i
want
to
elect
a
congressmen
for
me,
then
i
can
certainly
select
him
for
me,
but
i'm
bound
by
what
he
does,
if
i
don't
like
him
i'll
go
over
and
get
into
another
district
and
elect
another
congressmen.
that
packing
house
is
a
representative
because
i
personally
selected
him
as
a
grower.
if
i
don't
want
him
to
represent
me
i'm
not
going
to
sign
my
contract
with
him,
i'll
sign
it
with
someone
else.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
must
confess
that
it's
a
little
easier
for
them
to
switch
than
it
is
for
me
to
switch
a
congressman
your
honor.
but
to
come
back
to
this
basic
point
the
agency
associations
are
there
because
the
farmer
wants
him
to
be
the
representative
your
honor.
if
the
farmer
didn't
want
him
to
be
the
representative
he
wouldn't
be
there
and
so
the
ultimate
choice
in
every
case
rests
with
the
farmer.
the
farmer
could
select
him
to
market
the
fruit
entirely,
if
he
wanted
to
do
so.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
your
honor
it
really
isn't
here.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
in
any
large
organization
it's
difficult
for
me
as
a
citizen
to
control
what
my
congressman
does,
much
less
what
the
president
does.
when
we
have
8,000
growers
i
suppose
it's
pretty
hard
for
one
of
them
to
do
it.
but
there
just
can't
be
any
question
that
the
voting
power
and
the
authority
in
the
sunkist
system
rests
with
the
grower,
he
makes
the
choice.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
know
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
don't
know
of
any
your
honor
it's
possible
to
have
them
but
i
know
of
no
challenge
to
either
the
sunkist
system
or
to
cooperative
generally
on
this
basis.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
that
could
very
well
have
been
but
i
know
of
none
and
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
certainly
a
valid
point
your
honor
certainly
we
must
look
to
the
effects
of
any
decision
on
cooperative
generally
and
on
the
economy
generally
yes.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor,
i
think
that's
correct
and
that's
why
i
would
suggest
that
i
think
in
application
of
what
capper-volstead
is
and
does
would
not
prohibit,
but
the
chief
justice
has
asked
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
now
let
me
point
out
that
there
are
the
restrictions
i
think
which
protect
the
society
generally.
capper-volstead
to
my
way
of
thinking
does
basically
two
things.
it
permits
the
farmers
to
get
together
in
a
very
liberal
fashion
to
market
their
fruit.
it
lays
down
a
test
and
that
is
it
must
be
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
producers.
now
that's
the
test
that's
within
capper-volstead
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
we
meet
that
organizational
test
as
the
bill
itself
said
if
the
farmers
in
good
faith
are
cooperatively
marketing
their
fruit
that
they
are
qualified
to
do
so.
now
mr.
justice
black
clearly
laid
down
the
additional
requirements
which
should
be
mentioned
here
because
it's
important
in
this
particular
area
where
you
have
just
questioning
me.
in
maryland
and
virginia
this
court
said
that
you
may
have
capper-volstead
organization
duly
qualified,
but
it
still
may
violate
the
antitrust
act
if
it
does
certain
things.
now
what's
the
test?
well,
there
are
two
key
phrases
there,
which
i
think
very
clearly
lay
out
what
the
basic
problem
is
here.
the
key
test
was
this.
are
the
acts
which
the
cooperative
has
engaged
in
legitimate
cooperative
activities
or
are
there
predatory
trade
practices?
now
to
the
extent
that
we
attempt
to
corral
all
of
the
packing
house
facilities
and
prevent
somebody
else
from
using
them,
if
that
constitutes
a
predatory
trade
practice
as
it's
probably
would
and
the
manner
in
which
the
question
was
stated
to
me,
the
cooperative
is
liable
for
the
damage
it
causes.
now
let's
note
the
difference.
there
is
a
still
a
capper-volstead
cooperative.
it
still
maybe
organized
appropriately,
but
it
has
monetary
civil
and
criminal
liability
for
violation
of
antitrust
statutes.
now
when
mr.
henderson
points
out
that
he
claims
here
that
we
monopolize
the
oranges
in
some
way
to
do
him
harm,
that's
not
our
question
here
today.
our
question
today
is
are
we
qualified?
we
are
going
back
and
we
are
perfectly
happy
and
willing
to
live
by
that
maryland
and
virginia
standard.
if
we
have
engaged
in
predatory
trade
practices
we
expect
to
pay
for
it
and
that's
the
issue
we
are
going
to
try
when
we
go
to
the
district
court.
that's
not
our
question
here
today,
but
in
terms
of
application
of
the
qualification
isn't
our
real
question
under
the
terms
of
capper-volstead,
are
we
as
a
groups
of
farmers
collectively
acting
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmer?
if
we're
acting
in
good
faith
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmer
we
are
qualified.
now
we'll
go
back
and
try
the
antitrust
problem
is
when
we
go
back
to
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
if
mr.
henderson
will
stipulate
that's
out
of
the
case
your
honor
i'll
be
most
happy
to
accept
that.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
only
to
the
extent
of
the
organization
itself
your
honor.
let's
talk
about
what
capper-volstead
qualification
means
is
as
i
understand
it.
if
we
are
qualified
it
means
that
our
organization
per
se
does
not
constitute
a
combination
and
violation
of
the
antitrust
statutes.
it
does
not
mean
that
any
of
our
conduct
with
respect
to
anyone
else
is
exempted
in
any
way.
it's
simply
that
the
arrangement
itself
is
not
a
combination.
now
if
we
have
conspired
with
anyone
outside
of
the
sunkist
organization
then
obviously
the
qualification
wouldn't
cover,
but
with
respect
to
the
units
of
the
sunkist
system,
yes
i
would
take
it
that
we're
qualified,
a
claim
cannot
be
made
that
there
is
an
illegal
conspiracy
under
section
1
with
an
agency
association.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
we
are
not
even
arguing
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
trial
court
matter,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
this.
our
contract
with
the
agency
association
is
not
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
statute.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
if
we
had
no
exemption
we
still
will
argue
that
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
restraint
that's
correct
your
honor
with
or
without
it,
but
certainly
we
don't
get
the
benefit
of
capper-volstead
if
we
are
not
qualified.
and
i
think
as
a
second
area
which
might
or
might
not
be
in
question
and
that
is
if
we
have
lost
our
exemption
entirely
are
the
farmers
themselves
in
the
cooperatives
entitled
to
contract
with
each
other.
we
think
the
capper-volstead
act
would
permit
them
to
do
so
but
conceivably
if
the
whole
system
is
invalidated
we
then
have
to
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no,
but
it
would
then
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
the
dealing
is
between
the
cooperatives
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--
were
qualified
under
capper-volstead.
we
would
then
might
have
to
fall
back
on
section
6
of
the
clayton
act
or
general
antitrust
law.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well
this
case
might
very
well
have
to
decide
when
we
go
back
in
the
trial
court,
what
kind
of
conduct
among
the
elements
of
sunkist
is
invalid
if
they
do
not
have
the
qualification.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
not
necessarily.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
that's
not
quite
our
position,
it's
almost.
our
position
is
that
they
organic
structure
per
se
is
not
any
improper
combination.
we
still
could
engage
in
predatory
trade
practices
i
suppose.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
i
think
you
stated
it
correctly
as
long
as
we
can
find
all
of
the
effect
to
the
matter
inside
the
association.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
would
say
that
there
could
be
no
conspiracy
between
them
as
separate
parties,
yes.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
permission
this
morning
i
should
first
of
all
like
to
talk
about
a
matter
of
two
terminology
and
then
perhaps
briefly
review
the
sunkist
system
and
its
units
before
we
go
forward
with
some
of
the
more
complicated
questions
of
the
membership
within
the
system.
i
was
interested
to
note
in
mr.
henderson's
opening
remarks
that
he
referred
to
the
petitioner
herein
as
a
small
packer
and
the
sunkist
as
the
dominant
combination
marketing
citrus
fruit.
i
suppose
we
could
easily
get
into
a
battle
of
adjectives
and
i
think
if
we
have
to
fight
about
dominative,
sunkist
could
probably
do
very
well
in
that
battle,
because
we
represent
the
small
grower
who
has
a
backyard
full
of
citrus
trees,
who
has
two
or
three
acres
as
well
as
the
larger
growers
who
are
large
enough
to
pack
their
own
fruit
in
their
own
packing
houses.
but
we
do
not
feel
this
is
basically
a
question
of
who
is
bigger
than
whom
or
who
is
smaller
than
whom.
we
believe
we
are
dealing
here
as
the
court
indicated
in
the
winckler
case
with
a
question
of
substance.
what
is
the
economic
effect
of
this
membership
that
the
petitioner
complains
about
and
is
there
something
proscribed
about
that
membership
or
about
the
effect
it
has
in
the
capper-volstead
act?
i
think
one
other
question
of
terminology
should
be
examined.
mr.
henderson
pointed
out
that
although
the
stipulation
which
both
parties
signed
described
these
associations
as
agency
associations
he
doesn't
now
like
that
term.
he
wants
to
call
them
commercial
packing
houses
and
of
course
he
may
define
his
terms
in
any
sense
he
prefers
here.
but
to
me
and
to
the
orange
industry
the
term
commercial
packing
house
means
something
different
and
i
think
it
points
out
precisely
what
this
litigation
is
about.
a
commercial
packing
house
to
me
means
an
individual
business
enterprise
which
buys
up
fruit.
generally
speaking
that
enterprise
will
go
out
to
the
farmer,
he
will
look
at
his
growth
and
he
will
by
the
fruit
on
the
tree,
often
perhaps
in
advance
as
a
hedge
against
a
free
use
or
something
of
that
sort
and
the
packer
then
owns
that
fruit,
it's
his
and
he
may
now
speculate
on
the
market.
he
can
hope
to
hold
it
at
a
time
when
the
market
will
bring
a
higher
price
for
that
fruit
and
whatever
price
he
gets
for
that
fruit
is
his.
he
no
longer
owes
the
grower
a
cent,
other
than
purchase
price
that
he
buys.
now
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
middleman
which
the
capper-volstead
act
was
aimed
at.
the
man
who
had
money
in
his
pocket,
who
could
go
out
and
buy
the
farmer's
product
and
then
he
could
speculate
on
what
he
could
make
on
that
product.
that's
the
flouring
mills
that
have
been
referred
to
in
the
legislative
history
mr.
henderson
talks
about
and
that
to
us
is
a
commercial
packing
house.
stipulation
here
is
crystal
clear.
there
is
no
commercial
packing
house
in
the
sunkist
system
in
that
sense.
the
stipulation
points
out
on
pages
36
and
37
of
the
record
that
all
of
the
economic
benefit
of
the
sunkist
system
returns
to
the
grower,
through
these
agency
associations.
the
agency
association
has
no
gain
or
loss
because
of
the
increased
price
if
any
or
the
lesser
price
if
any,
because
of
marketing
to
the
sunkist
system.
he
has
a
fixed
contract
for
a
fixed
return.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
does
indeed
make
a
profit.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct
your
honor,
that's
correct.
now
that
profit
is
a
profit
which
it
makes
at
a
fixed
fee
which
is
specified
in
it's
contract.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it's
a
contract
with
each
grower
your
honor.
the
--
each
agency
association
maintains
a
contract
with
an
individual
grower,
so
there
are
only
two
parties
to
the
contract.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
generally
speaking.
there
are
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
generally
not.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
we
talk
briefly
about
the
sunkist
system,
but
before
departing
from
this
point,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
when
i
refer
to
a
commercial
packing
house,
i
am
talking
about
a
packing
house
which
buys
the
fruit
and
thereafter
owns
it
and
receives
all
the
benefit
of
the
sale.
the
agency
associations
as
we
refer
to
them
are
a
distinct
kind
of
operation
and
they
are
packing
fruit
where
the
returns
of
the
proceeds
go
back
to
the
grower.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
there
is
a
very
substantial
dispute
with
respect
to
who
our
parties
are
and
who
in
the
real
sense
are
the
members
of
the
sunkist
system.
i
do
not
dispute
the
fact
and
it
is
stipulated
that
the
persons
who
own
the
agency
houses
which
amount
to
about
15%
of
the
fruit
in
the
sunkist
system,
are
not
necessarily
growers.
the
stipulation
says
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
stipulation
says
specifically
some
of
them
have
been,
some
of
them
are
not.
in
other
words
there
are
some
agency
houses
within
the
system.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
a
little
of
both
your
honor
and
let
me
read
the
stipulation.
the
stipulation
with
respect
to
these
two
matters,
which
both
of
these
last
questions
are
addressed
to
appears
at
page
35
of
the
record
and
it
says
first
that
agency
associations
constitute
14.9%
by
number
and
12.9%
by
volume
of
the
associations
within
the
system.
now
more
specifically
about
13%
of
the
oranges
which
are
marketed
through
sunkist
come
into
the
system
through
an
agency
association.
if
you
count
the
number
of
packing
houses,
roughly
a
120
in
the
system,
well
about
15%
of
them
are
agency
associations.
more
specifically
with
respect
to
fruit
growing
mr.
justice
black,
that
provides
about
four
pages
--
about
six
lines
from
the
bottom.
some
have
been
fruit
growers
and
some
have
not
been
fruit
growers.
we
do
not
here
claim
that
all
of
the
agency
associations
are
fruit
growers,
but
some
of
them
certainly
have
been.
now
that's
not
a
point
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
we
may
have
in
the
form
in
which
we
have
them
in
sunkist,
an
agency
association
as
a
corporate
member
of
sunkist
growers
incorporated,
which
is
not
a
grower
of
the
fruit.
now
you
will
note
that
i
draw
the
distinction
between
the
member
of
the
sunkist
system
as
a
whole
and
the
technical
membership
as
a
corporate
member
of
sunkist
growers
incorporated.
these
are
different
unities
in
my
view
and
i'll
come
to
that
point
in
a
moment,
but
that's
only
one
of
the
many
unities
and
structures
in
sunkist
grower
system
as
a
whole.
let's
take
a
look
at
the
system,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
a
little
bit
more
about
how
sunkist
operates
and
what
these
various
structures
do.
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
facts
i'm
now
going
to
discuss
on
what
the
plaintiff
says
as
it's
critical
issue
are
actually
quite
different
for
the
two
halves
of
this
lawsuit,
because
as
i
understand
the
plaintiff's
position
is
a
very
simple
one.
the
agency
association
is
a
member
of
sunkist
growers,
therefore
per
se,
that
terminates
the
question
on
exemption.
that
wasn't
true
as
a
fact,
when
this
lawsuit
was
filed
and
is
not
true
for
about
half
of
the
period
covered
by
the
lawsuit.
the
complaint
was
filed
in
this
lawsuit
on
april
15,
1958,
seeking
damages
for
three
years.
a
supplemental
complaint
was
filed
in
june
1962
adding
almost
an
additional
four
years
to
january
1962.
so
we
cover
a
period
of
little
less
than
seven
years.
on
october
31,
1958
various
changes
were
made
in
the
sunkist
structure.
so
for
a
period
now
about
three
and
a
half
years
to
start
with,
we
have
a
different
fact
situation,
from
the
second
period
of
a
little
less
than
three
and
a
half
years.
now
let
me
tell
you
first
about
the
first
half
of
this
lawsuit
and
then
what
the
changes
were
for
the
second
half
of
the
lawsuit.
as
you
now
know,
sunkist
is
basically
a
pyramidal
structure,
it's
built
on
a
principle
of
representation.
we
have
at
the
base
as
the
record
says
some
12,000
growers,
actually
the
number
of
growers
in
california
are
decreasing;
subdivisions,
increased
property
taxes
are
cutting
down
the
production
of
oranges.
but
nevertheless
the
growers
at
the
base
and
the
grower
on
an
individual
non-cooperative
basis
produces
his
own
fruit
up
to
the
point
of
picking.
generally
speaking
the
sunkist
system
or
the
packing
house
has
nothing
to
do
with
raising
the
fruit.
they
have
research
assistants.
they
may
do
--
provide
some
assistance
with
respect
to
problems
of
growing,
but
that's
an
individual
problem
for
the
grower.
when
he
brings
his
fruit
to
the
point
where
it's
ready
to
picked,
generally
the
packing
house
picks
it.
now
it
may
on
occasion
not
be
picked
by
the
packing
house,
but
it
is
then
brought
to
a
packing
house.
at
the
packing
house
the
physical
handing
of
the
fresh
fruit
for
marketing
takes
place.
now
bear
in
mind
this
lawsuit
is
for
product
fruit
and
therefore
i
mentioned
fresh
fruit
only
in
passing
because
it
does
tie
into
the
structure
of
sunkist.
but
the
packing
house
function
is
a
function
dealing
with
fresh
fruit
primarily.
there
the
fruit
is
sorted,
it's
washed,
it's
graded,
it's
packed
and
when
it's
sold
it's
shipped
directly
from
the
packing
house
to
the
ultimate
purchaser,
it
doesn't
go
to
any
other
sunkist
facility.
when
however
a
decision
is
made
that
the
fruit
is
to
be
product
grouped,
for
whatever
reason,
it
probably
is
already
at
the
packing
house,
it
may
still
be
at
the
farm.
but
when
that
decision
is
made,
the
fruit
is
moved
directly
to
the
processing
facilities
of
sunkist
and
it
may
never
go
to
the
packing
house
or
it
may
be
there
only
briefly
and
go
to
sunkist.
and
it
is
at
the
processing
facilities
of
sunkist
known
generally
as
exchange
orange,
where
the
fruit
is
juiced,
it's
processed
into
either
concentrated
juice
or
however
it's
sold.
it
maybe
sold
as
chilled
juice,
it
maybe
sold
into
various
peeled
products,
it
maybe
sold
peeled
products
as
fertilizer
or
various
pharmaceuticals,
whatever
product
is
built
from
it.
when
product
fruit
--
the
product
that
is
then
made
or
perhaps
i
should
go
back
a
step,
the
determination
as
to
whether
that
fruit
will
be
sold
perhaps
a
whole
fruit
to
a
processor
or
will
be
processed
into
a
particular
product
is
made
by
sunkist,
it's
not
made
by
the
packing
house.
sunkist
also
makes
the
determination
where
it
will
be
sold,
when
it
will
sold,
what
the
price
will
be,
and
who
the
purchaser
is.
as
you
can
appreciate
the
fruit
from
mini
growers
is
pooled
in
this
kind
of
a
process
and
therefore
an
accounting
is
kept
on
the
quality
of
the
fruit
which
comes
in,
the
percentage
of
solids
that
the
fruit
has,
so
the
grower
can
be
fairly
paid
and
when
sunkist
has
a
return,
the
return
is
paid
back
first
to
the
packing
house
on
product
fruit.
the
packing
house
in
turn
under
the
agreement
determines
which
of
its
growers
brought
that
fruit
into
sunkist.
the
packing
house
deducts
its
fixed
fee
and
its
costs
and
returns
the
net
proceeds
of
operation
back
to
the
grower.
now
in
terms
of
the
formal
organization
of
sunkist,
the
grower
signs
the
contract,
which
is
attached
as
exhibit
b
to
the
stipulation,
if
he
is
dealing
with
an
agency
association.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
handling
of
the
fruits
is
identical.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
is
identical
with
one
exception.
so
far
as
the
operating
funds
are
concerned,
sunkist
operates
on
the
basis
of
revolving
funds,
so
that
from
product
fruit
an
amount
not
to
exceed
$0.50
a
tonne
is
withheld
as
a
revolving
fund.
as
it's
paid
in,
it's
paid
back
out
to
the
people
who
first
had
that
deduction
made
and
that
means
in
effect
that
a
growers
gets
back
all
of
his
money
now
except
this
assessment
and
about
six
or
seven
years
later
he
gets
back
that
small
amount
which
operates
as
sunkist's
operating
capital.
now
that
applies
uniformly
across
the
board.
if
however
the
grower
is
dealing
through
a
cooperative
association
and
you
are
aware
i
am
sure
that
about
80%
of
the
sunkist
fruit
comes
in
through
cooperatives,
the
cooperative
will
also
have
a
similar
arrangement
for
paying
its
capital
costs,
so
that
it
generally
will
have
either
a
capital
contribution
or
a
revolving
fund.
when
the
fund
is
paid
back
from
sunkist
to
a
cooperative,
it
will
deduct
its
capital
charge
and
then
return
the
proceeds
after
its
costs,
return
its
proceeds
to
the
grower.
when
the
funds
come
back
to
the
agency
association,
instead
of
deducting
the
capital
fund
it
deducts
its
charges.
in
other
words,
to
put
the
situation
i
think
simply
in
effect
the
grower
and
the
agency
association
is
running
the
facilities
and
paying
a
rental
today
for
the
services
he
gets.
the
grower
who
uses
a
cooperative
does
it
on
an
amortizing
basis
where
he
participates
in
a
revolving
fund
and
must
maintain
a
part
of
the
capital
to
maintain
those
facilities
and
the
end
result
of
this
for
the
grower
you
can
see
is
a
substantial
advantage.
it
means
the
growers
has
two
choices
instead
of
one.
instead
of
getting
into
a
cooperative
where
he
must
commit
his
capital
to
maintain
the
packing
house
facilities,
he
may
pay
it
on
a
current
basis,
a
rental
type
basis.
instead
of
my
building
the
house,
i'll
have
you
build
it
and
i'll
pay
you
so
much
a
year
out
of
the
fruit
that
goes
through
it.
now
of
course
as
you
also
aware
both
the
contract
here
which
is
set
up
as
between
the
grower
and
the
agency
association
and
each
of
the
units
in
the
sunkist
have
the
right
every
year
to
terminate
that
relationship.
so
that
if
the
grower
doesn't
like
the
amount
that
he
is
having
to
pay
to
this
agency
association
he
can
terminate
it
at
the
end
of
any
year
in
addition
to
the
escape
clause
which
was
mentioned
few
moments
ago
and
this
serves
a
very
healthy
purpose
within
the
system.
as
i've
indicated
we
have
the
order
of
the
120
packing
houses.
if
you've
ever
driven
through
the
oranges
growers,
orange
district
of
southern
california
and
gone
into
a
little
town
such
as
redlands
or
san
bernardino
or
orange
and
gone
down
by
the
railroad
track,
you'll
see
lined
up
one
after
the
other
orange
packing
houses,
agency
house,
a
cooperative,
a
cooperative,
an
agency
house,
and
if
you
are
a
grower
you
can
walk
into
any
one
of
those
and
sign
them
up
for
next
year
and
if
you
don't
like
the
fees
in
one
house
and
you
don't
like
the
way
you
are
getting
paid
you
have
a
good
healthy
competition
between
them
or
if
you
think
an
agency
--
if
you
think
the
cooperative
can
serve
you
better,
you
can
walk
next
door
and
have
your
fruit
delivered
to
a
cooperative.
after
you
get
your
fruit
on
a
truck,
it's
only
a
question
of
30
or
40
minutes
on
a
good
highway
to
dozens
of
packing
houses
within
your
area.
so
we
have
a
healthy
competition
between
the
packing
houses
that
means
an
additional
service
and
benefit
to
grower.
now
let
me
go
back
to
the
formal
organization
of
sunkist.
we
know
now
how
they
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
not
entirely
your
honor.
sunkist
serves
an
area
up
into
the
san
joaquin
valley.
as
you
know
the
large
orange
growing
areas
are
centered
between
say
redlands
and
down
into
orange
county,
but
there
are
oranges
into
san
diego,
there
are
citrus
product
--
there
is
citrus
production
in
the
coachella
valley
and
there
are
now
large
new
growers
being
planted
in
the
san
joaquin
valley,
largely
navels
for
the
fresh
fruit
market,
however
navels
don't
process
very
well
and
there
are
packing
houses
in
that
area.
so
you
are
quite
correct
your
honor
there
is
a
concentration
in
southern
california,
but
there
are
outlying
areas
and
there
are
i
believe
eight
or
nine
houses
in
arizona.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes,
your
honor.
now
let's
go
back
to
the
formal
structure.
we
know
now
that
the
growers
are
in
the
packing
houses
and
one
of
these
three
kinds
of
relations,
an
agency
association,
a
cooperative
or
they
may
have
their
own
packing
house
which
they've
built.
they
are
then
organized
into
district
exchanges.
historically
the
stipulation
points
out
how
the
district
exchanges
grew
as
the
first
unit
of
development
to
bring
them
together
in
their
market.
the
associations
are
members
of
the
district
exchanges.
they
are
non-profit
cooperative
membership
associations.
the
packing
houses
elect
the
representatives
to
the
district
exchanges.
looking
now
at
the
first
half
of
this
lawsuit.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
district
exchange
during
the
first
half
of
the
lawsuit
your
honor,
each
nominated
a
person
who
became
the
member
of
sunkist
growers
incorporated
and
who
served
on
the
board
of
directors.
now
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question
a
few
moments
ago,
sunkist
is
in
fact
run
by
a
board
of
directors.
sunkist
is
a
corporation.
it's
a
nonprofit
membership
corporation.
its
members
and
its
board
of
directors
were
identical
in
the
first
half
of
this
lawsuit,
approximately
17
individuals
each
nominated
by
a
district
exchange.
they
determine
the
policy
of
sunkist
and
equally
important
they
hire
the
principal
employees,
the
economists
who
are
necessary
for
examination
of
the
market,
the
statisticians
or
the
general
manager
right
on
down
the
line.
so
sunkist
is
operated
in
effect
by
that
board
of
directors.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
growers
have
never
been
called
members
of
sunkist.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
still
they
are
not.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
your
honor,
during
the
first
half
of
the
lawsuit,
the
only
members
were
approximately
17
individuals.
now
bear
in
mind
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
you
honor.
now
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
articles
of
by
laws
and
in
some
of
the
passages
there
are
indications
that
maybe
the
member
was
really
the
district
exchange,
but
the
individuals
are
called
the
members.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
quite
possibly
they
were
not.
this
was
the
initial
position
which
the
petitioners
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
now
i
think
perhaps
now
is
the
time
to
answer
that
question
directly
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
certainly.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
cooperatives
are
members
of
the
district
association--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
that's
correct.
all
120
packing
houses
approximately
each
are
members
of
agencies.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct
or
whether
an
individual
grower
who
has
his
own
packing
house.
now
let's
go
back
to
this
question
which
justice
fortas
has
asked
because
this
is
--
it
seems
to
me
precisely
the
problem
we
are
dealing
with
here.
what
is
a
member
that
we
are
talking
about,
what's
the
critical
sense
of
member
in
this
litigation?
i
haven't
been
talking
about
members
of
the
sunkist
system
or
the
member
of
the
cooperative
at
all
in
my
sense
of
the
word
and
yet
i
think
what
i
have
said
the
impression
you
have
is
yes
we
are
talking
about
the
same
members.
i
am
talking
about
a
corporate
structure.
sunkist
growers
incorporated
is
a
nonprofit
corporation.
for
its
purposes
and
its
by
laws
its
corporate
members
are
designated
to
certain
people
and
they
come
through
a
representative
system.
they
do
and
they
did
during
half
of
the
lawsuit.
now
i
don't
think
when
we
talk
about
the
capper-volstead
cooperative
or
the
capper-volstead
qualification
we're
necessarily
talking
about
that
member
at
all,
who
we
call
a
member
in
our
bylaws
as
a
matter
of
corporate
technical
structure
of
the
organization.
when
we
talk
about
the
sunkist
system
as
a
whole
now,
this
court
has
already
said
in
winckler
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
unified
organization
the
sunkist
system.
now
let's
set
apart
for
a
moment
the
sunkist
system
over
here
as
a
whole
and
sunkist
growers
incorporated,
a
nonprofit
corporation
which
sits
at
the
apex
of
that
pyramidal
structure,
who
are
the
members
of
the
sunkist
system?
well
i
would
suggest
to
you
members
of
the
sunkist
system
are
those
people
who
have
its
beneficial
interest.
it
obviously,
if
i
am
permitted
to
get
a
substantial
portion
of
the
profit
that
this
entire
marketing
system
is
making,
i
can't
escape
the
consequences
of
that
by
not
calling
myself
a
member.
conversely
if
i
don't
call
myself
a
member
certainly
i
am
one
of
the
people
who
is
a
member.
and
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
in
looking
at
this
pyramidal
structure
now,
for
purposes
of
capper-volstead
the
people
who
have
the
benefit
of
this
system
are
the
growers,
because
they
receive
every
cent
that
the
sunkist
system
has
expect
for
costs
with
the
one
qualification
of
the
area
we
have
talked
about,
they
pay
a
rental
and
fixed
fee
to
the
agency
association,
but
that's
not
a
participation
in
the
variables
from
marketing,
that's
a
negotiated
fee
for
the
their
services.
and
so
every
cent
of
their
operation
filters
back
down
to
the
grower
and
therefore
i
would
suggest
to
you
when
we
talk
about
the
capper-volstead
act,
that
we're
talking
about
the
grower
as
the
member,
even
though
we
do
not
issue
a
membership
certificate
to
him
and
even
though
the
man
who
holds
a
membership
certificate
in
the
corporation,
sunkist
growers
incorporated,
may
now
be
an
agency
association.
now
that
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
your
honor
and
let
me
cite
to
you
the
language
of
capper-volstead
act
specifically.
it
says,
the
first
sentence,
the
50
word
sentence
mr.
henderson
has
talked
about
says
that
farmers
may
act
together
in
associations
and
it
then
says
corporate
or
otherwise,
now
corporate
obviously
requires
stock,
corporate
or
otherwise,
with
or
without
capital
stock
and
that's
broad
authorizing
language.
they
can
act
in
corporations
or
not
and
they
can
have
stock
or
not.
now
the
qualifications
down
below
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
sir,
its
quite
a
bit
your
honor,
quite
a
bit.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
there
are
two
clauses
that
follow
that
which
we
believe
are
critical
to
the
capper-volstead
act.
the
second
sentence
says,
such
associations
may
have
marketing
agencies
in
common.
now
the
marketing
agencies
obviously
are
someone
outside
the
grower
realm
who
they
may
employ
to
market
their
fruit.
going
on,
and
such
associations
and
their
members
may
make
the
necessary
contracts
and
agreements
to
affect
such
purposes,
so
that
they
also
have
the
power
to
contend
and
may
i
point
out
the
first
time
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
will
your
honor.
that's
followed
by
a
colon,
provided
however,
that
associations
are
operated
for
the
mutual
benefit
of
the
members
thereof
as
such
producers.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
as
such
producers
and
conform
to
one
or
both
of
the
following
requirements.
and
then
you
remember
there
are
two
alternate
requirements,
either
no
member
is
allowed
more
than
one
vote
because
of
the
amount
of
stock
he
has
or
membership
capital
he
has
contributed
or
the
association
doesn't
pay
dividends
in
excess
of
8%.
and
then
in
any
case
the
following,
which
is
the
last
requirement,
that
the
association
shall
not
deal
in
the
products
of
non-members
to
an
amount
greater
in
value
than
such
as
are
handled
for
its
members.
now
that's
the
complete
statute.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
then
are
handled
for
its
members.
the
last
clause
is
important
mr.
justice
black
because
it
says
that
the
association
may
have
non
member
fruit
and
sometime
ago
mr.
justice
black
asked
--
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
mr.
henderson,
what
would
happen
if
we
simply
excluded
all
of
the
agency
associations,
wouldn't
we
reach
the
result
just
by
marketing
their
fruit?
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
the
result
here
is
one
that
can
clearly
be
reached
under
the
non-membership
fruit.
let's
suppose
we
said
alright
agency
associations
go
out,
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
them,
but
we'll
market
your
fruit
for
you
and
we'll
call
you
non-members,
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
association
but
we
will
market
your
fruit
for
you.
this
paragraph
says
that
we
can
market
fruit
in
as
large
an
amount
as
we
already
are
marketing
by
acquiring
it
from
non-members
and
this
is
dealing
only
with
14
or
15%
or
actually
13%
of
the
fruit
in
the
system.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
could
we
agree
with
the
outsider
that
he
wouldn't?
i
would
think
not
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
attempt
to
do
it.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
that
would
be
inappropriate,
but
let
me
suggest
the
answer
to
it.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
would
say
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
would
say
you'd
have
to
divide
up
your
groups
of
members
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well
i'm
going
to
try
to
answer
that
but
i
think
you
can't
answer
it
until
you
tell
me
who
the
member
is,
who
is
applying.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
if
we're
taking
the
identical
packer
i
would
say
yes,
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
and
the
reason,
there
is
no
question
that
we
could
market
all
of
these
fruit
and
that
we
could
--
whether
he
is
himself
a
grower
or
not,
we
could
tie
him
to
the
identical
contract
we
have
now.
the
reason
being
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
i
believe
we
could
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
subject
to
the
qualification
that
you
haven't
permitted
me
to
state
yet,
which
i
now
will
state.
and
that
is,
that,
that
agency
with
whom
we
are
dealing,
returns
all
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
to
his
growers,
i
think
as
long
as
the
growers
receive
that
benefit,
we
can
make
the
arrangement
until
all
of
the
growers
producing
that
product
are
involved
in
the
system.
now
that's
the
key.
if
this
man
is
what
mr.
henderson
calls
a
commercial
packing
house,
so
that
he
goes
out
and
buys
his
own
fruit,
no,
i
don't
think
we
can
make
that
kind
of
an
arrangement
with
him,
i
certainly
would
not
suggest
it.
we're
obviously
not
dealing
with
that
situation
here.
but
the
capper-volstead
act
says
that
associations
of
growers
may
have
marketing
agencies
in
common
and
i
don't
think
you
would
argue
with
the
proposition
that
we
can
have
cooperative
a,
which
has
a
marketing
agent
and
we
have
cooperative
b
which
has
a
marketing
agent
and
those
two
marketing
agents
in
common
can
represent
the
associations,
because
the
statute
says
we
can
have
associations
in
common.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
your
honor
i
would
say
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
would
say
that
provision
with
respect
to
no
member
having
one
vote
illustrates
just
the
opposite,
that
it
does
contemplate
non-grower
members
and
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
or
let
me
put
it
this
way.
perhaps
we
are
going
to
draw
a
distinction
here
and
it
maybe
appropriate
between
members
and
stockholders.
but
it
is
apparent
that
first
of
all
the
senate
particularly
looked
carefully
at
the
raisin
growers
association
and
they
found
first
of
all
that
the
raisin
growers
had
non-grower
stockholders.
there
are
about
2,400
grower
stockholders
there
were
about
800
non-grower
stockholders.
so
roughly
about
a
quarter
of
the
stockholders
were
non-growers.
they
also
had
in
their
bylaws
however
that
they
could
not
pay
dividends
more
than
8%,
that's
apparently
where
this
came
from.
so
they
contemplated
that
here
was
an
association
with
non-grower
stockholders
who
could
participate
in
both
their
stock
but
that
they
were
limited
to
an
8%
return
on
their
capital.
now
i
think
the
key
also
maybe
found
in
the
phrase,
which
talks
about
what
we
believe
to
be
the
fundamental
test
of
capper-volstead,
and
that
is
provided
however
this
is
the
test
to
our
way
of
thinking
of
the
validity
of
capper-volstead
qualification,
provided
however
that
such
associations
are
operated
for
the
mutual
benefit
of
the
members
thereof
as
such
producers.
now
why
would
the
qualification
as
such
producers
be
necessary?
if
those
members
didn't
have
some
standing,
some
status
other
than
as
a
producer,
the
producers,
the
non-producers
are
limited
now
with
respect
to
that
next
requirement,
to
the
extent
of
their
capital
requirement
they
can
get
only
8%
on
their
investments.
but
they're
shareholders,
they
can
participate,
they
have
a
membership
status
in
effect,
but
they're
limited
to
an
8%
return
and
thereafter
all
of
the
benefit
of
the
operation
must
go
to
the
grower
himself
and
that's
the
principle
which
we
seek
to
live
up
to,
that's
the
principle
which
i
think
the
stipulation
clearly
shows
that
we
have
lived
up
to
in
sunkist.
we
operate
for
the
grower
and
we
return
our
benefits
to
the
grower
regardless
of
how
this
fruit
comes
into
the
system
and
we
treat
every
grower
on
an
equivalent
basis.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
contract
with
the
agency
association
your
honor
is
a
negotiated
contract.
the
grower
sits
down
and
negotiates
with
the
agency
association
on
what
he
will
charge.
if
the
grower
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
think
there
is
no
organization
that
bargains
with
it
your
honor.
i
think
it's
an
individual
bargaining
by
the
farmers
themselves
with
respect
to
costs.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
but
bear
in
mind,
this
agency
association
must
be
competitive
with
its
nearby
agency
association
and
most
give
the
same
sort
of
return
that
the
cooperatives
give.
now
frankly,
one
of
the
facts
that
agency
associations
are
able
to
compete
with
cooperatives
is
you
have
businessman
running
them
and
they're
willing
to
devote
the
12
or
18
or
20
hours
a
day
to
run
that
business
and
run
it
efficiently
and
therefore
they
can
run
as
efficiently
as
a
cooperative
organization.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
partly
correct
and
partly
wrong
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
no,
you're
quite
correct
that
they're
determining
what
their
price
will
be
with
their
farmer,
but
the
negotiation
between
the
individual
farmer
and
the
agency
association
involves
only
those
two.
now,
it
is
true,
sunkist
itself,
the
corporation
board
up
here
that
has
the
board
of
directors
running
it
has
the
right
to
call
those
contracts
in
and
review
them
and
if
they
don't
like
what's
going
on
they
can
terminate
them.
now
they
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
he
hasn't
your
honor,
not
at
all,
and
i
wouldn't
suggest
he
is.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct.
as
your
honor
well
knows
with
the
citrus
growers
in
california
and
elsewhere,
they
know
what's
going
on
in
the
business.
there
are
several
packing
houses
which
they
can
select
and
they
talk
to
the
man
next
door
who
has
two
acres.
they
can't
talk
the
agency
association
to
cutting
its
price
in
half.
but
he
can
go
to
the
agency,
a
house
next
door
or
the
cooperative
next
door
to
that
if
he
doesn't
get
a
good
price.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
would
be
a
terrible
situation
if
it
occurred
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
would
be
a
terrible
situation
that
if
it
occurred.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
first
of
all,
it
isn't
the
situation
we're
aware
of
that
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
all
right.
now
secondly
could
it
occur?
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
farmer
has
his
choice
with
respect
to
that.
the
farmer
selects
how
he's
going
to
participate
in
the
sunkist
system.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
you're
assuming
that
that's
what
the
farmer
wants,
because
it'll
only
get
that
way
if
the
farmer
wants
it
your
honor.
if
the
farmer
wants
to
say
to
the
packing
house,
you
take
all
of
my
fruit
and
market
it,
do
anything
you
want
to
do,
i
don't
want
to
see
it
again,
he
is
entitled
to
do
that
under
capper-volstead
isn't
he?
now
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
can't
answer
that
specifically
your
honor
to
say
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes,
today
as
i
stand
here,
sunkist
has
approximately
9,000
members
and
the
record
below
shows
that
we
were
handling
about
67%
of
the
product
fruit.
now,
our
membership
has
gone
down
since
that
time
and
the
product
production
has
gone
down,
but
that
will
give
you
some
general
idea
of
the
number
of
other
producers.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
particularly
in
southern
california
as
i've
said
we're
picking
up
a
few
in
the
central
valley
now,
but
let
me
go
back
to
this
question
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i'm
sorry
i
–
[laughter]
sunkist
has
9,000
growers.
we
always
consider
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
does
your
honor,
i
must
agree
that
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
sunkist
has
approximately
a
119
today.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
first
of
all
most
of
them
are
cooperative
associations.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
of
growers,
so
we'll
exclude
those
for
the
moment.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
those
are
about
80%.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
about
80%
are
cooperatives.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
we
take
out
another
roughly
5%
because
those
are
growers
who
have
their
own
packing
houses.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct
your
honor
and
they
petitioner
here
concedes,
that
sunkist
so
held,
i
mean,
that
winckler
so
held
in
their
brief.
now,
we
come
back
then
to
the
remaining
15%
by
number
approximately
which
are
agency
associations
as
we
have
descried.
our
last
review,
some
of
them
are
cooperation,
some
of
them
are
partnerships,
some
of
them
are
individual
proprietorships,
our
last
review
show
that
either
the
association
itself
or
the
stockholders
who
were
in
the
association
were
fruit
growers
except
two
or
three
situations.
but
we
still
had
as
of
the
time
we
last
looked,
at
least
one
perhaps
two,
perhaps
three,
of
these
agency
associations
who
were
not
growers.
but
let
me
suggest
that
that
is
the
fallacy
of
this
kind
of
a
test.
if
all
we're
looking
for
is
a
grower,
isn't
it
really
a
senseless
act
for
us
to
say
that
these
19%
of
these
agency
associations,
go
out
and
buy
yourself
a
couple
of
acres
of
oranges,
that
is
not
the
answer
to
our
problem.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
have
the
packing
house
have
a
acres
of
oranges
and
say
this
is
a
technical
statute,
you
got
to
be
a
grower,
now
you
are
grower
and
the
slate
is
clean,
that
isn't
our
problem.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
suppose
thought
we'd
have
to
draw
the
line
some
place,
wouldn't
we?
he
does
become
a
grower
at
some
point.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
but
let
me
come
back
to
our
central
issue,
my
time
is
running
short
and
i'll
try
to
make
two
or
three
points
rather
quickly.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
would
not
change
my
position
at
all
your
honor
so
long
as
all
the
economic
benefits
were
returning
to
the
grower.
so
long
as
the
middle
men
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
your
honor
it
wouldn't
and
let
me
put
what
seems
to
me
to
be
a
clear
example.
the
winckler
case
has
already
said
that
a
100%
of
the
--
all
of
these
growers
could
organize
into
one
association.
let's
avoid
the
membership
problem,
because
it's
that
label
that
follows
it
and
let's
suppose
we
organize
a
single
cooperative
with
12,000
growers
or
however
many
there
are,
as
the
members
and
the
cooperative
markets
the
fruit,
is
there
any
question
that
that
cooperative
now
having
a
100%
of
the
fruit
could
contract
with
all
of
the
packing
house
agencies
to
do
exactly
what
they
are
doing
now?
to
bring
the
fruit
in
from
the
grove,
to
wash
it,
to
pack
it,
to
ship
it
and
is
there
any
question
if
they
wanted
to,
those
growers
and
their
cooperative
could
say,
not
only
do
we
want
you
to
do
that
we
want
you
to
be
our
marketing
agent.
capper-volstead
says
they
can
have
a
marketing
agent.
now
essentially
every
function
that
the
agency
association
performs
is
a
clear
cooperative
legitimate
cooperative
activity.
certainly
the
washing,
packing,
sorting,
shipping,
that's
a
legitimate
activity.
the
farmers
can
hire
someone
to
do
that,
what
about
the
marketing?
well
to
the
extent
that
they
participate
in
the
marketing
that's
a
legitimate
activity.
now
if
we
could
have
those
associations
as
our
marketing
agent
and
have
them
do
everything
then
mr.
chief
justice
is
it
not
appropriate
to
say
to
those
agency
associations,
i
as
a
farmer
want
you
to
represent
me
in
this
sunkist
system,
you
are
my
representative
and
is
he
not
doing
a
great
deal
less
than
marketing
the
fruit.
now
what
are
these
terrible
things
that
these
members
in
sunkist
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes,
that
might
very
well
be
--
i
am
not,
i
am
not
sure
whether
that's
right
or
not,
but
let
me
suggest
that
is
not
the
fact
here.
we
were
talking
about
that
a
few
moments
ago
when
we
got
off
on
to
another
subject.
the
grower
selects
the
agency
association
to
represent
him,
other
growers
select
the
cooperatives.
if
i
as
a
grower
don't
want
the
agency
association
representing
me,
i
can
join
a
cooperative
and
i
can
participate
that
way
in
the
sunkist
system.
the
eventual
board
of
sunkist
is
made
up
off
those
person
elected
by
the
district
exchanges.
now
throughout
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well
there
are
now
17
or
18
your
honor,
there
is
one
association
in
process
as
a
district
exchange.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
they
are
associations
of
packing
houses
that's
correct.
now
it
is
true
that
the
agency
associations
has
a
vote
along
with
the
other
packing
houses
in
that
system
which
elects
the
representatives
to
the
district
exchange
and
then
by
further
representation
the
district
exchanges
elect
the
board
of
sunkist.
but
to
extent
that
they
are
participating
is
only
in
the
sense
that
they
are
actually
selecting
the
governing
body
of
sunkist
which
will
make
the
determinations.
now
that
body
therefore
represents
all
of
the
people
down
this
representative
structure.
a
very
small
portion
of
the
growers
of
which
have
come
through
representative
houses,
because
they
selected
them
as
their
representative.
the
contract
between
the
farmer
and
the
agency
association
is
a
competitive
contract,
it's
on
the
market,
if
he
isn't
meeting
the
competition
the
grower
won't
sign
up
with
him.
so
the
value
and
of
his
cost,
and
of
his
service
is
protected
by
the
competition
between
the
parties.
sunkist
does
not
purport
from
the
governing
board
to
tell
him
what
he
can
or
cannot
charge,
at
the
same
time
sunkist
has
the
right
to
and
does
review
these
contracts
from
time
to
time,
if
they
find
them
unfair
they
can
terminate
the
membership
of
that
individual.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
the
representatives
of
the
board.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
very
indirectly
your
honor
yes,
yes,
now
three
steps
removed
you
understand.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
think
if
they
favor
their
own
they
would
be
out
on
their
area
your
honor,
because
the
growers
control
this
organization
and
let
me
you
why.
you
are
talking
only
about
a
maximum
of
what
12.9%
of
the
fruit,
15%
by
number,
so
you
are
talking
about
15%
of
the
vote.
now
how
many
constituencies
are
dominated
by
15%
of
the
vote,
how
many
congressmen
are
elected
by
15%
of
their
vote?
the
other
85%
is
also
voting.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
oh
that's
right.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct,
i
didn't
tell
you
that
and
here
is
the
reason.
if
i
decide
i
want
to
elect
a
congressmen
for
me,
then
i
can
certainly
select
him
for
me,
but
i'm
bound
by
what
he
does,
if
i
don't
like
him
i'll
go
over
and
get
into
another
district
and
elect
another
congressmen.
that
packing
house
is
a
representative
because
i
personally
selected
him
as
a
grower.
if
i
don't
want
him
to
represent
me
i'm
not
going
to
sign
my
contract
with
him,
i'll
sign
it
with
someone
else.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
must
confess
that
it's
a
little
easier
for
them
to
switch
than
it
is
for
me
to
switch
a
congressman
your
honor.
but
to
come
back
to
this
basic
point
the
agency
associations
are
there
because
the
farmer
wants
him
to
be
the
representative
your
honor.
if
the
farmer
didn't
want
him
to
be
the
representative
he
wouldn't
be
there
and
so
the
ultimate
choice
in
every
case
rests
with
the
farmer.
the
farmer
could
select
him
to
market
the
fruit
entirely,
if
he
wanted
to
do
so.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
your
honor
it
really
isn't
here.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
in
any
large
organization
it's
difficult
for
me
as
a
citizen
to
control
what
my
congressman
does,
much
less
what
the
president
does.
when
we
have
8,000
growers
i
suppose
it's
pretty
hard
for
one
of
them
to
do
it.
but
there
just
can't
be
any
question
that
the
voting
power
and
the
authority
in
the
sunkist
system
rests
with
the
grower,
he
makes
the
choice.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
know
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
don't
know
of
any
your
honor
it's
possible
to
have
them
but
i
know
of
no
challenge
to
either
the
sunkist
system
or
to
cooperative
generally
on
this
basis.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
that
could
very
well
have
been
but
i
know
of
none
and
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
certainly
a
valid
point
your
honor
certainly
we
must
look
to
the
effects
of
any
decision
on
cooperative
generally
and
on
the
economy
generally
yes.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor,
i
think
that's
correct
and
that's
why
i
would
suggest
that
i
think
in
application
of
what
capper-volstead
is
and
does
would
not
prohibit,
but
the
chief
justice
has
asked
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
yes
now
let
me
point
out
that
there
are
the
restrictions
i
think
which
protect
the
society
generally.
capper-volstead
to
my
way
of
thinking
does
basically
two
things.
it
permits
the
farmers
to
get
together
in
a
very
liberal
fashion
to
market
their
fruit.
it
lays
down
a
test
and
that
is
it
must
be
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
producers.
now
that's
the
test
that's
within
capper-volstead
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
we
meet
that
organizational
test
as
the
bill
itself
said
if
the
farmers
in
good
faith
are
cooperatively
marketing
their
fruit
that
they
are
qualified
to
do
so.
now
mr.
justice
black
clearly
laid
down
the
additional
requirements
which
should
be
mentioned
here
because
it's
important
in
this
particular
area
where
you
have
just
questioning
me.
in
maryland
and
virginia
this
court
said
that
you
may
have
capper-volstead
organization
duly
qualified,
but
it
still
may
violate
the
antitrust
act
if
it
does
certain
things.
now
what's
the
test?
well,
there
are
two
key
phrases
there,
which
i
think
very
clearly
lay
out
what
the
basic
problem
is
here.
the
key
test
was
this.
are
the
acts
which
the
cooperative
has
engaged
in
legitimate
cooperative
activities
or
are
there
predatory
trade
practices?
now
to
the
extent
that
we
attempt
to
corral
all
of
the
packing
house
facilities
and
prevent
somebody
else
from
using
them,
if
that
constitutes
a
predatory
trade
practice
as
it's
probably
would
and
the
manner
in
which
the
question
was
stated
to
me,
the
cooperative
is
liable
for
the
damage
it
causes.
now
let's
note
the
difference.
there
is
a
still
a
capper-volstead
cooperative.
it
still
maybe
organized
appropriately,
but
it
has
monetary
civil
and
criminal
liability
for
violation
of
antitrust
statutes.
now
when
mr.
henderson
points
out
that
he
claims
here
that
we
monopolize
the
oranges
in
some
way
to
do
him
harm,
that's
not
our
question
here
today.
our
question
today
is
are
we
qualified?
we
are
going
back
and
we
are
perfectly
happy
and
willing
to
live
by
that
maryland
and
virginia
standard.
if
we
have
engaged
in
predatory
trade
practices
we
expect
to
pay
for
it
and
that's
the
issue
we
are
going
to
try
when
we
go
to
the
district
court.
that's
not
our
question
here
today,
but
in
terms
of
application
of
the
qualification
isn't
our
real
question
under
the
terms
of
capper-volstead,
are
we
as
a
groups
of
farmers
collectively
acting
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmer?
if
we're
acting
in
good
faith
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmer
we
are
qualified.
now
we'll
go
back
and
try
the
antitrust
problem
is
when
we
go
back
to
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
if
mr.
henderson
will
stipulate
that's
out
of
the
case
your
honor
i'll
be
most
happy
to
accept
that.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
only
to
the
extent
of
the
organization
itself
your
honor.
let's
talk
about
what
capper-volstead
qualification
means
is
as
i
understand
it.
if
we
are
qualified
it
means
that
our
organization
per
se
does
not
constitute
a
combination
and
violation
of
the
antitrust
statutes.
it
does
not
mean
that
any
of
our
conduct
with
respect
to
anyone
else
is
exempted
in
any
way.
it's
simply
that
the
arrangement
itself
is
not
a
combination.
now
if
we
have
conspired
with
anyone
outside
of
the
sunkist
organization
then
obviously
the
qualification
wouldn't
cover,
but
with
respect
to
the
units
of
the
sunkist
system,
yes
i
would
take
it
that
we're
qualified,
a
claim
cannot
be
made
that
there
is
an
illegal
conspiracy
under
section
1
with
an
agency
association.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
we
are
not
even
arguing
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
trial
court
matter,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
this.
our
contract
with
the
agency
association
is
not
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
statute.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
if
we
had
no
exemption
we
still
will
argue
that
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
restraint
that's
correct
your
honor
with
or
without
it,
but
certainly
we
don't
get
the
benefit
of
capper-volstead
if
we
are
not
qualified.
and
i
think
as
a
second
area
which
might
or
might
not
be
in
question
and
that
is
if
we
have
lost
our
exemption
entirely
are
the
farmers
themselves
in
the
cooperatives
entitled
to
contract
with
each
other.
we
think
the
capper-volstead
act
would
permit
them
to
do
so
but
conceivably
if
the
whole
system
is
invalidated
we
then
have
to
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no,
but
it
would
then
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
the
dealing
is
between
the
cooperatives
--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--
were
qualified
under
capper-volstead.
we
would
then
might
have
to
fall
back
on
section
6
of
the
clayton
act
or
general
antitrust
law.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well
this
case
might
very
well
have
to
decide
when
we
go
back
in
the
trial
court,
what
kind
of
conduct
among
the
elements
of
sunkist
is
invalid
if
they
do
not
have
the
qualification.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
not
necessarily.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
that's
not
quite
our
position,
it's
almost.
our
position
is
that
they
organic
structure
per
se
is
not
any
improper
combination.
we
still
could
engage
in
predatory
trade
practices
i
suppose.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no
i
think
you
stated
it
correctly
as
long
as
we
can
find
all
of
the
effect
to
the
matter
inside
the
association.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
would
say
that
there
could
be
no
conspiracy
between
them
as
separate
parties,
yes.
thank
you
your
honor.
