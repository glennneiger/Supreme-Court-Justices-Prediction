mr.
william
h.
henderson
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
treble
damage
action
for
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
case-swayne
company,
a
small
factory
of
food
products,
including
orange,
juice
brought
the
action
against
sunkist
growers
inc.,
the
dominant
citrus
fruit
combination
of
california
and
arizona.
the
district
court
directed
a
verdict
against
case-swayne.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
case-swayne
had
made
a
prime
facie
case
for
the
jury
on
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
but
the
courtroom,
one
judge
dissenting
that
sunkist
had
complied
with
section
1
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
this
is
the
only
issue,
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
concerned
with.
we
invite
the
court's
attention
to
judge
walter
ely
dissenting
opinion
on
this
issue
at
page
185
of
the
record
because
this
opinion
states
case-swayne's
position
on
that
issue.
your
honors,
the
single
question
before
this
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
the
interpretation
of
a
single
sentence
from
section
1
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
this
is
the
first
sentence
of
the
section
and
it
contains
only
50
words.
now,
in
substance
it
provides
members
of
capper-volstead
association
must
be
engaged
in
the
production
of
agricultural
products
as
farmers
or
as
specifically
pertaining
to
this
case
as
fruit
growers.
nothing
could
appear
clear
than
this
language
and
we
submit
at
least
in
this
case
the
language
means
what
it
says.
for
the
intent
of
congress
was
that
only
actual
farmers,
actual
growers,
the
people
who
till
the
soil
could
organize
a
capper-volstead
association.
in
our
opening
brief,
we
quote
from
the
legislative
history.
this
history
explicitly
shows
congress
intended
that
only
actual
farmers,
the
people
who
grow
the
crop
could
form
a
capper-volstead
association.
i
call
your
honor's
attention
particularly
to
the
colloquy
between
senator's
cummins,
kellogg,
and
townsend
quoted
on
pages
9
and
10
of
our
opening
brief.
these
senators
wanted
to
make
certain
that
the
specific
language
of
section
1
which
is
under
consideration
in
this
writ
would
not
permit
the
middle
man
such
as
flour
mills
and
packers
who
in
a
broad
sentence
are
engaged
in
the
production
of
agricultural
products
to
organize
co-operations
and
fix
the
prices
of
their
products.
indeed
the
history
shows
further,
it
shows
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
permit
farmers
to
organize
and
market
their
products
through
an
association
so
that
they
would
not
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
middleman.
the
acts
legislated
history
is
crowded
with
preferences
showing
this
intent.
we
have
found
no
legislative
history
indicated
any
intent
to
the
congress
contrary
and
some
case
has
referred
this
to
them.
now
here,
let's
look
at
the
stipulation.
the
stipulation
is
very
specific,
it
clearly
shows
the
inclusion
of
the
middleman
in
sunkist
membership.
approximately
15%
of
sunkist
members
are
not
farmers,
they
are
not
growers,
they
are
not
capper-volstead
associations
but
normally
private
corporations.
now,
in
the
capper-volstead
stipulation
these
members
are
denominated
agencies,
associations
and
that
is
not
a
correct
denomination.
they
are
not
associations.
they
are
commercial
packing
houses
and
if
your
honors
with
bear
with
me,
i'm
going
to
try
to
use
that
term
because
that's
what
they
are,
commercial
packing
houses.
they
perform
a
traditional
middleman
function
in
the
citrus
fruit
industry.
they
pick,
they
wash,
pack
and
market
the
citrus
fruit
of
growers.
now
the
packing
house
is
not
an
invention
of
sunkist.
they
didn't
invent
the
packing
house
and
they're
assisting
before
that
sunkist
system
was
established
packing
houses
were
commercial
ventures
and
during
the
period
of
this
action
some
16
to
18
of
these
commercial
packing
houses
marketed
their
byproduct
fruit
through
the
morgan
ward
company.
so
your
honors
when
sunkist
admitted
these
commercial
packing
houses
to
the
extent
of
15%
of
its
total
membership,
sunkist
greatly
increased
its
control
of
oranges
in
the
relevant
market.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
all,
no.
your
honor
that
would
include
oranges
and
lemons
or
any
citrus
fruit.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
how
many
were
engaged
in
processing
oranges?
mr.
william
h.
henderson
15
of
the
15%
engaged
in
process
--
well,
they
were
all
engaged
in
processing
the
oranges
but
they
processed
other
fruits
likewise
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas,
my
associates
have
advised
me
that
i
did
not
precisely
answer
your
last
question
to
me.
at
times
i
do
not
hear
as
well
as
i
did
20
years
ago.
so
please
bear
with
me.
your
honor
asked
me
whether
the
commercial
packing
houses,
which
constitute
approximately
15%
of
sunkist
membership,
all
handle
oranges
and
canned
and
freeze
them.
now
they
do
all
handle
oranges
and
in
the
year
1957,
1958
for
example
this
amounted
to
$15
million
worth
of
oranges,
but
they
do
not
freeze
or
can
oranges.
this
is
done
by
the
processing
division
of
sunkist.
here
is
what
the
packing
houses
do.
they
purchase
the
oranges
from
the
growers
under
a
cost
plus
contract
which
i
will
go
into;
they
pick,
wash,
grade
and
then
market
the
fruit
through
sunkist
as
a
sunkist
member.
now
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
turn
briefly
to
discuss
some
of
the
answers
sunkist
does
raise
to
our
conventions.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes
i
have
that
as
one
of
the
points,
i
will
address
the
court.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
normally
private
corporations.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
profit
making
corporations.
they
have
stipulated
they
are
not
associations
organized
under
the
capper-volstead
act.
now
your
honors
i
have
read
and
reread
sunkist
brief.
i
haven't
found
a
single
sentence,
not
a
single
word
that
bases
up
to
this
fact.
the
language
in
section
1
of
the
act
before
this
court
explicitly
provides
only
actual
farmers;
growers
may
form
a
capper-volstead
association.
i
have
not
found
a
single
word,
not
a
single
sentence
showing
that
congress
did
not
mean
that
when
they
enacted
the
act.
now
i
have
found
pages
of
argument
as
to
what
congress
intended
when
it
passed
the
general
agricultural
marketing
act,
the
sherman
act
and
the
farm
laborers
exemption
and
appropriation
acts
and
i
have
read
sunkist
story
of
the
california
association
raisin
company
problem
with
the
federal
trade
commission,
but
i
don't
think
that
as
of
any
consequence,
but
i
am
going
to
refer
one
moment
to
the
california
raisin
corporation.
sunkist
contention
to
abbreviate
seemed
to
be
that
a
capper-volstead
association
may
have
non-grower
investors
who
may
receive
dividends
not
to
exceed
8%.
well
let
us
assume
this
is
correct,
the
legislative
history
is
entirely
clear.
well
that
isn't
the
question
we
have
to
contend
with
and
now
you
are
not
going
to
contend
the
questions
not
before
the
court.
sunkist
is
not
a
capital
stock
corporation
and
there
is
no
legislative
history
supporting
the
view
that
middlemen,
packers,
commercial
packing
houses
could
comprise
the
membership
of
a
capper-volstead
association.
now
i
do
notice
sunkist
cites
one
reference
to
the
affect
that
this
california
raisin
association
may
have
been
contemplated
by
the
act.
it
may
impact
that
a
capper-volstead
association,
well
that
was
the
capital
stock
association
could
have
commercial
investors,
but
it
was
clear
that
the
membership
had
to
be
packers
as
such.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
had
to
be
growers
or
associations
of
growers
which
id
to
be
the
same
thing.
for
example
i
am
going
to
read
one
quote
from
the
legislative
history
of
hr
13931,
which
is
a
history
they
quote
--
they
re-quote
one
referenced
to
it.
now
it's
the
65th
congress
predecessor
bill
of
1920.
senator
lenroot
of
wisconsin:
“i
think
that
under
this
measure
there
might
be
various
kinds
of
organizations
and
that
they
could
all
combine
into
one
new
organization.
i
do
not
believe
however
that
under
the
terms
of
the
bill
an
organization
of
wheat
farmers
could
combine
with
an
organization
of
cotton
growers
and
the
association
of
wheat
growers,
sell
cotton
or
deal
with
it
in
any
way.
”
senator
king:
“but
could
they
combine
with
the
millers
or
the
warehouse
men?
”
senator
lenroot,
who
was
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill:
“certainly
not,
a
miller
would
not
be
within
the
terms
of
the
proposed
law
at
all
nor
would
a
warehouse
be.
”
now
your
honor,
sunkist
contends
that
the
issue
presented
by
this
writ
or
decided
by
the
court
in
sunkist
growers
inc.
versus
winckler
&
smith
citrus
products
company.
this
was
sunkist's
primary
contention
in
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals.
for
example
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
asked
sun,
stated
he
says,
i
am
not
going
into
the
issue,
that's
the
capper-volstead
issue
that
was
decided
by
the
court
in
the
winckler
case
and
he
asked
sunkist
counsel,
don't
you
think
that's
correct
and
the
counsel
replied
and
i
quote,
“we
believe
the
court
is
absolutely
correct.
”
our
position
on
this
is
simply
this.
the
issue
before
this
court
was
not
disposed
off
in
the
winckler
case.
winckler
conceded
that
that
sunkist
was
a
capper-volstead
association.
on
the
other
hand,
we
challenge
the
wholeness
of
the
majority
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
sunkist
was
a
capper-volstead
association.
next
contention;
sunkist
argues
that
membership
of
its
non-growers,
that
is
its
commercial
packing
houses
has
no
legal
or
economic
significance.
this
seems
to
have
emerged
as
the
principal
contention
before
this
court.
the
main
theme
is
stated
at
page
55
of
the
sunkist
brief.
it
argues,
a
membership
certificate
is
of
the
minimus
importance
without
economic
significance.
in
other
words,
they
say
that
membership
in
congress
--
in
sunkist
is
just
a
scrap
of
paper.
we
do
not
agree.
our
position
is
that
permitting
non-growers,
middlemen,
packers,
commercial
packing
houses
to
organize
a
capper-volstead
association
is
not
of
the
minimus
importance
and
it
is
not
without
great
economic
significance.
in
this
case
alone,
for
example
sunkist
non-grower
membership
of
commercial
packing
houses
furnished
approximately
13%
of
sunkist
citrus
fruit.
in
the
year
1957,
1958
this
13%
amounted
to
over
$15
million
of
oranges
alone
controlled
by
sunkist,
not
counting
the
lemons
and
the
grape
fruit
and
for
the
same
year
it
amounted
to
over
$23
million
of
sunkist
total
sales.
your
honors
thus
these
non-grower
commercial
packing
houses
very
appreciably
strengthen
sunkist
monopoly
power.
they
very
appreciably
enabled
sunkist
to
wrongly
use
monopoly
power
and
attempt
to
monopolize
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
it
would
hardly
need
mentioning
that
members
of
a
membership
association
control
the
association,
its
management
and
the
packing
houses
are
the
most
important
members
of
sunkist.
only
the
packing
houses
which
include
these
commercial
packing
houses
have
proprietary
rights
and
interests
in
sunkist.
congress
deliberately
chose
language
that
would
preclude
the
middlemen,
flour
mills,
packers,
commercial
packing
houses
from
organizing
capper-volstead
association.
may
i
ask
your
honors,
if
15%
could
become
members
of
a
cooperative
why
not
50%,
why
not
a
100%.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
board
of
the
directors
is
the
governing
body
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
packers
are
represented
on
the
board
of
directors
through
the
agency
of
the
district
exchange.
the
district
exchange
represents
the
packing
houses
that
the
board
is
controlled
by
the
volume
of
fruit
from
the
packing
houses
only
the
packing
houses
contribute
fruit.
the
district
exchange
is
a
conduit
of
information
as
described.
they
do
not
grow
fruit.
they
communicate
between
sunkist
and
the
packing
houses,
but
basically
the
ownership
in
the
corporation
is
restricted
to
the
packing
houses
and
the
packing
houses
through
the
district
exchange
and
depending
upon
the
volume
of
fruit
select
the
governing
body
of
sunkist
directors.
so
in
other
words,
we
submit
that
a
holding
by
this
court
that
non-growers
such
as
commercial
packing
houses
may
combine
in
cooperatives
and
fix
the
price
of
their
products
or
services
would
open
the
door
to
price
fixing
by
packers,
commercial
packing
houses
or
anyone
who
in
a
broad
sense
produces
an
agricultural
product,
but
does
not
grow
it
and
the
act
and
the
congressional
history
states,
the
members
must
be
growers
or
i
will
say
capper-volstead
association
of
grower
which
i
deem
would
be
the
same
thing.
now
sunkist
argues
that
despite
the
provisions
of
the
contract
under
which
sunkist
non-grower
members
obtained
the
growers
fruit,
the
tile
to
the
fruit
does
not
pass
to
the
commercial
packing
houses.
this
is
the
argument
been
picked
up
in
the
majority
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
this
is
the
point
justice
fortas
have
interested.
now
here
what
the
majority
decisions
states.
he
asked
this
question;
does
the
fact
that
the
so
called
agency
associations
constitute
a
class
of
membership
prevents
sunkist
from
being
a
person
engaged
in
the
production
of
an
agricultural
product
under
section
1
of
the
act?
now
that
question
is
confusing
because
sunkist
has
never
contended
that
sunkist
was
a
producer
of
agricultural
product.
the
contention
that
has
been
that
sunkist
is
capper-volstead
association
that
markets
the
fruit
of
its
members.
then
the
majority
decision
posed
the
preamble
to
that
part
of
the
capper-volstead
relation
which
providing
that
the
exhibit
b
to
the
stipulation
is
a
typical
contract
under
which
sunkist
non-grower
members
acquire
a
growers
fruit.
now
this
preamble
states
that
these
commercial
packing
houses
or
costs
and
a
fixed
fee
furnish
their
services
on
an
independent
contract
basis
unrelated
to
their
returns
from
the
fruit.
this
preamble
is
but
one
way
of
stating
that
these
commercial
packing
houses
will
not
gamble
their
profits
or
as
a
assured
as
with
the
commercial
enterprise
profits
that
provided
the
war
materials
under
cost
plus
contracts
in
world
war
ii.
the
important
points
on
this
are
first;
the
growers
under
this
cost
plus
contract
have
no
control
over
the
costs
of
these
commercial
packing
houses.
second;
the
growers
have
no
control
over
these
commercial
packing
houses
when
they
as
sunkist
members
control
sunkist
management
and
its
policies.
sunkist
argues
title
doesn't
pass
and
i
think
that's
an
idle
argument
because
the
title
passes
at
some
point.
the
contract
specifically
provides
that
it
does
pass
and
they
sell
it,
but
it
passes
at
least
when
it
has
reached
the
supermarket
or
when
the
fruit
have
may
reached
your
honors
at
your
breakfast
table.
the
point
is
they
are
non-growers,
they
are
middlemen
and
they
purchase
their
fruit
or
acquire
it
from
commercial
packing
houses
and
they
have
no
voice
in
fixing
the
cost
of
these
commercial
packing
houses
and
they
have
no
voice
in
the
management
of
sunkist.
sunkist
also
argues
that
capper-volstead
association
could
legally
enter
into
a
contract
such
as
exhibit
b
with
non-grower.
a
grower
or
a
cooperative
could
have
entered
into
this
contract,
perhaps
he
could.
a
capper-volstead
association
no
doubt
and
may
does
enter
in
many
types
of
contracts
with
packers,
packing
houses,
painters,
plumbers,
lawyers,
knowing
the
people,
but
that's
not
the
issue
your
honor.
the
issue
on
this
writ
of
certiorari
is
who
may
comprise
the
membership
of
a
capper-volstead
association,
not
who
may
a
duly
organized
capper-volstead
association
contract
with.
your
honor
another
argument
sunkist
argues
that
it
has
done
a
good
job
for
the
california
citrus
food
industry
that
seems
a
theme
that
pervades
entire
brief.
now
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
the
first
to
admit
that
it
--
sunkist
has
done
a
splendid
job.
for
sunkist,
one
such
job
was
the
elimination
of
other
manufactures
of
orange
product
such
as
general
fruits
corporation,
highland
stanford
corporation.
treesweet
had
to
build
a
plant
in
florida
to
supply
its
demand
for
a
single
strength
juice
in
california,
but
we
also
admit
such
a
fine
job
is
not
compatible
with
the
sherman
act.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
well
yes,
i
am
glad
answer
question.
the
practical
effect
would
be
this.
to
the
extent
of
oranges
i
think
i
said
$13
million
these
would
be
independent
and
may
--
these
oranges
would
have
or
might
have
been
available
to
the
processors.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
sunkist
can
buy
their
oranges
from
packing
houses,
yes,
but
when
they
make
the
members
of
it
then
they
have
a
restrictive
agreement
that
they
cannot
sell
to
anyone
else
and
therefore
you
have
--
have
your
packing
houses
that
this
that
they
are
not
available,
the
oranges
they
control,
they
were
not
available
to
process
that.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
no,
because
for
this
reason,
when
they
made
them
members,
they
do
three
things.
they
eliminate
that
fruit
from
the
availability
to
others.
i
mean
they
can't
bid,
the
members
agree
that
they
supply
all
this
fruit
to
sunkist.
next
when
they
make
the
members,
they
dilute
the
memberships
with
middleman,
those
members
are
the
only
ones,
those
members,
the
councilors,
they
sit
with
the
packers
and
form
the
policy,
and
they
are
commercial
packing
houses.
second,
the
grower
has
no
control
over
the
cost
of
these
commercial
packing
houses,
they
fix
their
own
costs.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
they
can
negotiate
it,
but
it
isn't
cost
driven,
yes,
but
when
they
make
the
members
they
increase
sunkist
control
of
oranges,
i
mean
they
tie
them
up.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
section
was
--
what
your
honor?
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
section
1
trial
was
dismissed
by
a
pretrial
order
in
the
same
order
that
the
court
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes,
in
other
words,
when
we
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
i
think
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yeah,
the
allegation
we
think
it
was
true.
there
were
three
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
no,
we
didn't
dismiss,
the
pretrial
order
of
the
court
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
before
trial
of
the
court
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
court
ordered
it
out.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
no,
on
a
pretrial
order,
when
the
court
decided
that
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
well,
there
was
one
previous
attempt;
first
we
alleged
a
conspiracy
between
sunkist
exchange
orange
and
exchange
lemon.
then
the
court
ruled
that
the
capper-volstead
issue
was
in
favor
of
sunkist.
so
they
said
upon
that
basis,
we
--
the
court
ordered
the
case
combined
to
simply
a
such
motion
section
2
case
mr.
william
h.
henderson
then
the
court
later
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
then
the
court
later,
after
trial
directed
a
verdict
under
the
section
2
charge.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
under
yes
--
as
per
section
1.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
court
said
yes,
it
said
it
could
do
anything
it
wanted
to
do,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
correct
and
it
was
a
nonmember,
they
had
no
exemptions,
there
were
many
things
the
court
could
not
do
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
well,
what
sunkist
could
do?
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
court
rule
exempt.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yeah,
it
says,
the
court
of
appeals
said
even
with
the
exemption
we
had
a
section
2
case.
now,
the
importance
of
the
membership
is
that
this,
that
this
membership
permits
non-packers,
commercial
enterprisers,
the
middleman
to
be
part
of
the
organization
and
it
ties
up
the
fruit
to
that
extent
because
the
agreements
under
which
they
obtained
their
fruit
are
restricted
tie-in
agreement,
you
have
to
give
us
all
your
fruit,
your
product
fruit,
we're
concerned
the
product
fruit,
but
if
you
don't
give
us
your
--
all
your
fruit,
including
your
product
fruit
you
can't
use
the
sunkist
label.
so
that
works
when
they
tied
up
say
$13
million
of
fruit
by
restricted
tie-in
agreements,
they
enhanced
their
control
of
the
california,
arizona
market
of
oranges
to
that
extent.
they
were
able
to
more
effectively
exercise
wrongful
use
of
monopoly
power
and
they
were
more
effectively
able
to
attempt
to
monopolize
under
the
antitrust
laws.
in
other
words,
these
contracts
with
the
members
which
are
in
the
bylaws
of
the
organization,
say
the
packing
house,
the
packing
house
is
the
member
that's
the
only
member
that
sunkist
gets
it's
fruit
from,
but
the
packing
house
goes
out
and
ties
up
contracts
with
non-growers
and
they're
restrictive
contracts
with
growers,
they
tie
them
up
with
growers
and
they
are
restrictive
contracts.
they
have
to
turnover
all
their
fruit.
so
therefore
they
as
a
member
and
these
commercial
packing
houses
were
members
to
the
extent
of
$13
million
of
orange
juice
tied
up
that
much
fruit.
and
that
enabled
them
to
that
extent
to
enlarge
their
control
over
the
oranges
grown
in
california
and
arizona
and
to
that
extent
enable
them
to
attempt
to
monopolize
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes,
and
it
also
provides
that
they
get
paid
$2.50
a
case,
but
the
point
is
your
honor
the
actual
members
of
sunkist
are
the
packing
houses,
that's
who
sunkist
gets
the
oranges
from,
that's
how
oranges
are
marketed
through
packing
house.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes,
well
the
point
on
that
is
your
honor,
that
the
packing
house
agreed
that
all
the
fruit
it
can
tie
up
with
a
turnover
to
the
sunkist
for
marketing.
now
it
enters
into
these
contracts
with
the
growers.
there
is
an
escape
clause
or
a
penalty
that
as
much
as
it
as
it
is
tied
up,
but
it
does
go
--
it
does
go
to
the
packing
house
and
through
their
restrictive
agreement
it
does
go
to
sunkist.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
articles
of
association
do
provide
that
that's
their
duty
is
tie
up
fruit
of
the
growers.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
and
i
suppose
they
did
to
the
best
way
they
could
and
that
this
is
the
difficult
part.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes.
it
goes
back
to
say
that
these
--
what
it
emphasis
the
fact
that
these
commercial
packing
houses
they
are
not
controlled
by
their
cooperative,
they
are
looking
out
for
themselves,
they
are
middlemen
and
they
say
we
want
cost
plus
and
then
if
you
are
going
to
take
some
of
the
fruit
away
from
it
whether
you
got
to
pay
us
a
penalty,
but
the
point
is,
under
the
articles
of
association
that
you
are
obligated
that
is
the
packing
house
members
to
tie
up
the
fruit
of
the
growers.
now
this
the
best
perhaps
they
could
tie
up
with
a
commercial
packing
houses.
but
they
--
and
they
do
tie
them
up
except
for
--
except
when
your
honor
they
pay
him
penalty
of
$250
a
ton.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
per
ton
all
the
fruit
used
for
processing
yes.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes,
yeah,
that's
correct.
that's
the
processing
fruit
the
processors
use.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
i
think
that
it
can
be
composed
of
15%
commercial
packing
houses
could
be
composed
of
100%.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yeah.
i
see
no
reason.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
correct.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes.
now
the
legislative
history
and
this
colloquy
between
senator
cummings
and
townsend
and
i
referred
to
this,
they
referred
specifically
to
this
section
and
they
said,
do
you
mean
--
does
that
mean
that
someone
who
in
a
broad
sense
in
producers
of
agriculture
product
like
a
packing
house
or
a
packer
like
my
clients
need
to
produce
some
agriculture
products
or
is
it
restricted
to
farmers
or
actually
who
grow
it,
want
to
grow
the
crop
and
they
said
it
is
restricted
to
farmers
and
i
went
through
that
list
of
legislative
history
and
i
find
very
clearly
that,
that
was
intent
for
the
man
who
tills
the
soil,
the
farmer
who
grows
the
crops,
they
only
could
combine.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
well
had
that
not
been
the
purpose
it
would
have
permitted
packers
to
fix
prices.
it
would
have
permitted
any
man
to
fix
prices.
it
--
the
reason
was
to
protect
the
farmer.
there
wouldn't
be
any
other
reason.
that
was
clear,
the
reason
was
to
let
these
farmers
fix
their
prices
through
a
cooperative.
now
when
i
say
a
farmer
and
the
grower
i
will
concede
that
if
it
is
a
farmer
organization
that
is
the
capper-volstead
association,
it
can
be
a
member
because
basically
then
it
is
a
grower.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
i
didn't
get
the
first
part,
what
was
it
what?
mr.
william
h.
henderson
i
would
have
serious
questions
on
that
because
that's
a
question
we
don't
have
to
answer
because
perhaps
a
corporation
may
be
a
grower
but
these
corporations,
these
packing
houses
were
normally,
mostly
corporations
and
they
did
not
grow
fruit.
so
i
don't
answer
the
question.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes
there
are
about
four
some
odd
percent
who
grow
fruit
and
operate
their
own
packing
houses
and
they
also
are
sunkist
members.
they
supply
about
4%.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
no
we
do
not
take
that
because
we
do
--
i
felt
we
do
not
have
to
because
the
corporations
we
are
involved
with
do
not
grow
fruit
and
therefore
we
don't
have
to
argue
about
the
ones
that
do
grow.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
no
i
am
talking
about
15%
are
normally
corporations,
they
do
not
grow
fruit,
they
are
stipulated
to
be
non-cooperatives.
now
there
are
4%
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
in
addition.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
that
are
corporations
that
do
grow
fruit
and
operate
packing
houses.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that
additional
3
to
4%.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
only
going
to
take
up
to
few
points.
first
the
stipulation
so
that
we
shall
be
clear
just
what
we
are
speaking
about.
there
were
some
questions
of
whether
we
were
talking
about
non-growers.
now
i
want
to
refer
your
honors
to
page
35
of
the
record.
three
corporate
growers
were
not
concerned
with
the
ones
that
corporation
that
grow
fruit.
they
constitute
for
0.975
by
number
and
for
0.72
by
volume,
but
we
are
concerned
with
item
4,
what
are
called
agency
associations
and
we
call
them
commercial
packing
houses
and
the
stipulation
is
clear
on
that,
they
are
non-growers.
for
example,
agency
associations
constitute
14.91%
by
number
and
49%
by
volume
of
all
associations
in
the
sunkist
system.
the
agency
association
is
normally
a
private
corporation.
such
agency
associations
do
not
qualify
nor
do
they
claim
to
be
cooperative
associations
acting
under
section
1
of
capper-volstead
act.
the
agency
association
furnishes
these
facilities
on
the
independent
contract
basis
and
relate
it
to
net
returns.
a
contract
between
such
an
agency
association
and
it's
growers
which
maybe
deemed
typical
of
such
associations
is
attached
here
to
as
exhibit
b.
further
showing
they're
not
growers,
this
court
may
refer
in
page
41
where
it
defines
the
different
functions,
on
the
second
whole
paragraph
with
regard
to
the
physical
handling
of
fruit,
the
growers
cares
for
the
fruit,
cares
for
the
trees
and
brings
the
citrus
fruit
to
the
point
where
it
is
ready
to
be
picked.
the
packing
house
association
then
normally
sends
its
specialized
crews
into
the
groves
to
pick
the
fruit
and
it
is
stipulated
that
they
obtain
their
fruit
under
exhibit
b
to
the
contract
now,
and
that
provide
the
sale
of
the
fruit.
now,
i'm
also
going
to
mention
mr.
hufstedler's
argument
that
for
the
first
half
of
the
lawsuit
the
member
--
these
commercial
associations
or
these
packing
houses,
all
members
were
not
members.
well,
this
lawsuit
commenced
may
15,
1958.
on
october
3,
the
october
1,
1958
then
all
packing
house
members
became
direct
denominated
members
of
sunkist.
and
may
i
refer
the
court
to
page
3
of
our
brief.
only
the
packing
house
members
have
property
rights
and
interests
in
sunkist.
now,
as
to
the
district
exchange,
they
only
representative,
the
packing
houses
and
that
is
stipulated
here.
even
before
they
were
direct
members,
they
were
indirect
members
through
the
packing
--
through
the
district
exchange.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yeah.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes,
correct.
in
other
words
before
october
31
they
were
represented
to
the
district
exchange
which
has
stipulated
to
its
one
of
the
conduits
of
communication
and
representation
between
the
packing
house
association
and
sunkist.
so
before
that
time
they
were
indirect
members.
after
october
1,
1958
and
during
most
of
the
period
of
this
suit
they
became
direct
members
and
they
are
the
only
packing
house
members
that
have
property
rights
and
interests
in
sunkist.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
not
that
i
know
of.
our
discovery
--
this
--
all
i
know
is
up
to
this
--
we
stipulated
that
up
till
1962
during
the
period
encompassed
so
far
that's
how
it
remained.
they
are
all
members,
they're
denominated
members,
they
still
are
the
only
members
who
have
interest
before
that,
realistically
they
were
the
only
members
who
had
interests
in
sunkist.
now,
the
next
argument
is
that
the
growers
receive
all
the
benefits.
well
that
isn't
true.
when
the
packing
house
is
the
capper-volstead
association
then
the
growers
are
in
practical
affect
sunkist
members.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that,
we
think
the
court
implied
that
in
the
winckler
case.
but
when
the
packing
house
is
an
agency
association
or
more
accurately
a
commercial
packing
house
it's
neither
a
grower,
neither
an
association
growers,
it
is
not
in
any
realistic
theory
a
sunkist
member
and
the
grower
does
not
receive
the
benefits
of
cooperative
marketing.
first,
a
grower
is
marketing
his
fruit
through
a
middleman
or
he
--
or
for
his
fruit
he
receives
the
net
returns
from
the
fruit
less
the
cost
of
the
commercial
packing
house
and
he
has
no
control
over
the
cost
of
this
commercial
packing
house.
and
then
there's
a
fixed
fee
per
case
of
fruit,
it's
the
cost
plus
contract,
the
type
of
contract
which
was
so
popular
in
world
war
ii.
second,
the
agency
association
over
which
the
grower
which
belongs
to
it
has
no
control,
that
association
is
the
member
that
sits
in
the
sunkist
meetings.
he
is
the
member
who
controls
sunkist
in
the
final
analysis
and
he
determines
the
policy
that
is
all
the
packing,
whether
it's
the
benevolent
or
whether
it's
predatory.
now,
your
honor
in
conclusion,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
provisos.
we
are
concerned
with
the
first
sentence
of
the
first
section.
the
first
sentence
says
who
may
be
a
member
of
a
capper-volstead
association
and
the
history
is
clear
that
is
the
farmer.
it
is
stipulated
that
these
agency
associations
are
not
cooperative
so
that
they
do
not
comply
with
provisos
one,
two
or
three,
we
don't
have
to
argue
that
because
they
stipulate,
they
don't
comply.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
this
was
the
intent
of
congress
and
this
court's
decision
in
milk
producers
association
versus
united
states
stated
this
to
be
the
intent
of
congress
and
your
honor
in
the
gordon
(ph)
case
this
court
stated
the
persons
to
whom
the
capper-volstead
act
applies
are
defined
in
section
1
as
producers
of
agricultural
products.
in
the
milk
producers
case,
the
court
said
that
congress
intended
actual
farmers
that
was
the
intent
to
take
advantage
of
this
act.
now
under
that
situation
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
it's
settled
law.
it
is
not
a
judicial
function
to
rewrite
the
language
of
a
statute
clearly,
ambiguity
and
permit
non-growers,
commercial
packing
houses
to
organize
capper-volstead
association,
that
is
our
contention
that
it's
only
for
farmers.
well,
we
believe
this
language
means
what
it
says
and
it
applies
all
associations,
even
sunkist,
thank
you.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
treble
damage
action
for
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
case-swayne
company,
a
small
factory
of
food
products,
including
orange,
juice
brought
the
action
against
sunkist
growers
inc.,
the
dominant
citrus
fruit
combination
of
california
and
arizona.
the
district
court
directed
a
verdict
against
case-swayne.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
case-swayne
had
made
a
prime
facie
case
for
the
jury
on
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
but
the
courtroom,
one
judge
dissenting
that
sunkist
had
complied
with
section
1
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
this
is
the
only
issue,
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
concerned
with.
we
invite
the
court's
attention
to
judge
walter
ely
dissenting
opinion
on
this
issue
at
page
185
of
the
record
because
this
opinion
states
case-swayne's
position
on
that
issue.
your
honors,
the
single
question
before
this
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
the
interpretation
of
a
single
sentence
from
section
1
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
this
is
the
first
sentence
of
the
section
and
it
contains
only
50
words.
now,
in
substance
it
provides
members
of
capper-volstead
association
must
be
engaged
in
the
production
of
agricultural
products
as
farmers
or
as
specifically
pertaining
to
this
case
as
fruit
growers.
nothing
could
appear
clear
than
this
language
and
we
submit
at
least
in
this
case
the
language
means
what
it
says.
for
the
intent
of
congress
was
that
only
actual
farmers,
actual
growers,
the
people
who
till
the
soil
could
organize
a
capper-volstead
association.
in
our
opening
brief,
we
quote
from
the
legislative
history.
this
history
explicitly
shows
congress
intended
that
only
actual
farmers,
the
people
who
grow
the
crop
could
form
a
capper-volstead
association.
i
call
your
honor's
attention
particularly
to
the
colloquy
between
senator's
cummins,
kellogg,
and
townsend
quoted
on
pages
9
and
10
of
our
opening
brief.
these
senators
wanted
to
make
certain
that
the
specific
language
of
section
1
which
is
under
consideration
in
this
writ
would
not
permit
the
middle
man
such
as
flour
mills
and
packers
who
in
a
broad
sentence
are
engaged
in
the
production
of
agricultural
products
to
organize
co-operations
and
fix
the
prices
of
their
products.
indeed
the
history
shows
further,
it
shows
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
permit
farmers
to
organize
and
market
their
products
through
an
association
so
that
they
would
not
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
middleman.
the
acts
legislated
history
is
crowded
with
preferences
showing
this
intent.
we
have
found
no
legislative
history
indicated
any
intent
to
the
congress
contrary
and
some
case
has
referred
this
to
them.
now
here,
let's
look
at
the
stipulation.
the
stipulation
is
very
specific,
it
clearly
shows
the
inclusion
of
the
middleman
in
sunkist
membership.
approximately
15%
of
sunkist
members
are
not
farmers,
they
are
not
growers,
they
are
not
capper-volstead
associations
but
normally
private
corporations.
now,
in
the
capper-volstead
stipulation
these
members
are
denominated
agencies,
associations
and
that
is
not
a
correct
denomination.
they
are
not
associations.
they
are
commercial
packing
houses
and
if
your
honors
with
bear
with
me,
i'm
going
to
try
to
use
that
term
because
that's
what
they
are,
commercial
packing
houses.
they
perform
a
traditional
middleman
function
in
the
citrus
fruit
industry.
they
pick,
they
wash,
pack
and
market
the
citrus
fruit
of
growers.
now
the
packing
house
is
not
an
invention
of
sunkist.
they
didn't
invent
the
packing
house
and
they're
assisting
before
that
sunkist
system
was
established
packing
houses
were
commercial
ventures
and
during
the
period
of
this
action
some
16
to
18
of
these
commercial
packing
houses
marketed
their
byproduct
fruit
through
the
morgan
ward
company.
so
your
honors
when
sunkist
admitted
these
commercial
packing
houses
to
the
extent
of
15%
of
its
total
membership,
sunkist
greatly
increased
its
control
of
oranges
in
the
relevant
market.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
all,
no.
your
honor
that
would
include
oranges
and
lemons
or
any
citrus
fruit.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
how
many
were
engaged
in
processing
oranges?
mr.
william
h.
henderson
15
of
the
15%
engaged
in
process
--
well,
they
were
all
engaged
in
processing
the
oranges
but
they
processed
other
fruits
likewise
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas,
my
associates
have
advised
me
that
i
did
not
precisely
answer
your
last
question
to
me.
at
times
i
do
not
hear
as
well
as
i
did
20
years
ago.
so
please
bear
with
me.
your
honor
asked
me
whether
the
commercial
packing
houses,
which
constitute
approximately
15%
of
sunkist
membership,
all
handle
oranges
and
canned
and
freeze
them.
now
they
do
all
handle
oranges
and
in
the
year
1957,
1958
for
example
this
amounted
to
$15
million
worth
of
oranges,
but
they
do
not
freeze
or
can
oranges.
this
is
done
by
the
processing
division
of
sunkist.
here
is
what
the
packing
houses
do.
they
purchase
the
oranges
from
the
growers
under
a
cost
plus
contract
which
i
will
go
into;
they
pick,
wash,
grade
and
then
market
the
fruit
through
sunkist
as
a
sunkist
member.
now
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
turn
briefly
to
discuss
some
of
the
answers
sunkist
does
raise
to
our
conventions.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes
i
have
that
as
one
of
the
points,
i
will
address
the
court.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
normally
private
corporations.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
profit
making
corporations.
they
have
stipulated
they
are
not
associations
organized
under
the
capper-volstead
act.
now
your
honors
i
have
read
and
reread
sunkist
brief.
i
haven't
found
a
single
sentence,
not
a
single
word
that
bases
up
to
this
fact.
the
language
in
section
1
of
the
act
before
this
court
explicitly
provides
only
actual
farmers;
growers
may
form
a
capper-volstead
association.
i
have
not
found
a
single
word,
not
a
single
sentence
showing
that
congress
did
not
mean
that
when
they
enacted
the
act.
now
i
have
found
pages
of
argument
as
to
what
congress
intended
when
it
passed
the
general
agricultural
marketing
act,
the
sherman
act
and
the
farm
laborers
exemption
and
appropriation
acts
and
i
have
read
sunkist
story
of
the
california
association
raisin
company
problem
with
the
federal
trade
commission,
but
i
don't
think
that
as
of
any
consequence,
but
i
am
going
to
refer
one
moment
to
the
california
raisin
corporation.
sunkist
contention
to
abbreviate
seemed
to
be
that
a
capper-volstead
association
may
have
non-grower
investors
who
may
receive
dividends
not
to
exceed
8%.
well
let
us
assume
this
is
correct,
the
legislative
history
is
entirely
clear.
well
that
isn't
the
question
we
have
to
contend
with
and
now
you
are
not
going
to
contend
the
questions
not
before
the
court.
sunkist
is
not
a
capital
stock
corporation
and
there
is
no
legislative
history
supporting
the
view
that
middlemen,
packers,
commercial
packing
houses
could
comprise
the
membership
of
a
capper-volstead
association.
now
i
do
notice
sunkist
cites
one
reference
to
the
affect
that
this
california
raisin
association
may
have
been
contemplated
by
the
act.
it
may
impact
that
a
capper-volstead
association,
well
that
was
the
capital
stock
association
could
have
commercial
investors,
but
it
was
clear
that
the
membership
had
to
be
packers
as
such.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
had
to
be
growers
or
associations
of
growers
which
id
to
be
the
same
thing.
for
example
i
am
going
to
read
one
quote
from
the
legislative
history
of
hr
13931,
which
is
a
history
they
quote
--
they
re-quote
one
referenced
to
it.
now
it's
the
65th
congress
predecessor
bill
of
1920.
senator
lenroot
of
wisconsin:
“i
think
that
under
this
measure
there
might
be
various
kinds
of
organizations
and
that
they
could
all
combine
into
one
new
organization.
i
do
not
believe
however
that
under
the
terms
of
the
bill
an
organization
of
wheat
farmers
could
combine
with
an
organization
of
cotton
growers
and
the
association
of
wheat
growers,
sell
cotton
or
deal
with
it
in
any
way.
”
senator
king:
“but
could
they
combine
with
the
millers
or
the
warehouse
men?
”
senator
lenroot,
who
was
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill:
“certainly
not,
a
miller
would
not
be
within
the
terms
of
the
proposed
law
at
all
nor
would
a
warehouse
be.
”
now
your
honor,
sunkist
contends
that
the
issue
presented
by
this
writ
or
decided
by
the
court
in
sunkist
growers
inc.
versus
winckler
&
smith
citrus
products
company.
this
was
sunkist's
primary
contention
in
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals.
for
example
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
asked
sun,
stated
he
says,
i
am
not
going
into
the
issue,
that's
the
capper-volstead
issue
that
was
decided
by
the
court
in
the
winckler
case
and
he
asked
sunkist
counsel,
don't
you
think
that's
correct
and
the
counsel
replied
and
i
quote,
“we
believe
the
court
is
absolutely
correct.
”
our
position
on
this
is
simply
this.
the
issue
before
this
court
was
not
disposed
off
in
the
winckler
case.
winckler
conceded
that
that
sunkist
was
a
capper-volstead
association.
on
the
other
hand,
we
challenge
the
wholeness
of
the
majority
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
sunkist
was
a
capper-volstead
association.
next
contention;
sunkist
argues
that
membership
of
its
non-growers,
that
is
its
commercial
packing
houses
has
no
legal
or
economic
significance.
this
seems
to
have
emerged
as
the
principal
contention
before
this
court.
the
main
theme
is
stated
at
page
55
of
the
sunkist
brief.
it
argues,
a
membership
certificate
is
of
the
minimus
importance
without
economic
significance.
in
other
words,
they
say
that
membership
in
congress
--
in
sunkist
is
just
a
scrap
of
paper.
we
do
not
agree.
our
position
is
that
permitting
non-growers,
middlemen,
packers,
commercial
packing
houses
to
organize
a
capper-volstead
association
is
not
of
the
minimus
importance
and
it
is
not
without
great
economic
significance.
in
this
case
alone,
for
example
sunkist
non-grower
membership
of
commercial
packing
houses
furnished
approximately
13%
of
sunkist
citrus
fruit.
in
the
year
1957,
1958
this
13%
amounted
to
over
$15
million
of
oranges
alone
controlled
by
sunkist,
not
counting
the
lemons
and
the
grape
fruit
and
for
the
same
year
it
amounted
to
over
$23
million
of
sunkist
total
sales.
your
honors
thus
these
non-grower
commercial
packing
houses
very
appreciably
strengthen
sunkist
monopoly
power.
they
very
appreciably
enabled
sunkist
to
wrongly
use
monopoly
power
and
attempt
to
monopolize
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
it
would
hardly
need
mentioning
that
members
of
a
membership
association
control
the
association,
its
management
and
the
packing
houses
are
the
most
important
members
of
sunkist.
only
the
packing
houses
which
include
these
commercial
packing
houses
have
proprietary
rights
and
interests
in
sunkist.
congress
deliberately
chose
language
that
would
preclude
the
middlemen,
flour
mills,
packers,
commercial
packing
houses
from
organizing
capper-volstead
association.
may
i
ask
your
honors,
if
15%
could
become
members
of
a
cooperative
why
not
50%,
why
not
a
100%.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
board
of
the
directors
is
the
governing
body
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
packers
are
represented
on
the
board
of
directors
through
the
agency
of
the
district
exchange.
the
district
exchange
represents
the
packing
houses
that
the
board
is
controlled
by
the
volume
of
fruit
from
the
packing
houses
only
the
packing
houses
contribute
fruit.
the
district
exchange
is
a
conduit
of
information
as
described.
they
do
not
grow
fruit.
they
communicate
between
sunkist
and
the
packing
houses,
but
basically
the
ownership
in
the
corporation
is
restricted
to
the
packing
houses
and
the
packing
houses
through
the
district
exchange
and
depending
upon
the
volume
of
fruit
select
the
governing
body
of
sunkist
directors.
so
in
other
words,
we
submit
that
a
holding
by
this
court
that
non-growers
such
as
commercial
packing
houses
may
combine
in
cooperatives
and
fix
the
price
of
their
products
or
services
would
open
the
door
to
price
fixing
by
packers,
commercial
packing
houses
or
anyone
who
in
a
broad
sense
produces
an
agricultural
product,
but
does
not
grow
it
and
the
act
and
the
congressional
history
states,
the
members
must
be
growers
or
i
will
say
capper-volstead
association
of
grower
which
i
deem
would
be
the
same
thing.
now
sunkist
argues
that
despite
the
provisions
of
the
contract
under
which
sunkist
non-grower
members
obtained
the
growers
fruit,
the
tile
to
the
fruit
does
not
pass
to
the
commercial
packing
houses.
this
is
the
argument
been
picked
up
in
the
majority
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
this
is
the
point
justice
fortas
have
interested.
now
here
what
the
majority
decisions
states.
he
asked
this
question;
does
the
fact
that
the
so
called
agency
associations
constitute
a
class
of
membership
prevents
sunkist
from
being
a
person
engaged
in
the
production
of
an
agricultural
product
under
section
1
of
the
act?
now
that
question
is
confusing
because
sunkist
has
never
contended
that
sunkist
was
a
producer
of
agricultural
product.
the
contention
that
has
been
that
sunkist
is
capper-volstead
association
that
markets
the
fruit
of
its
members.
then
the
majority
decision
posed
the
preamble
to
that
part
of
the
capper-volstead
relation
which
providing
that
the
exhibit
b
to
the
stipulation
is
a
typical
contract
under
which
sunkist
non-grower
members
acquire
a
growers
fruit.
now
this
preamble
states
that
these
commercial
packing
houses
or
costs
and
a
fixed
fee
furnish
their
services
on
an
independent
contract
basis
unrelated
to
their
returns
from
the
fruit.
this
preamble
is
but
one
way
of
stating
that
these
commercial
packing
houses
will
not
gamble
their
profits
or
as
a
assured
as
with
the
commercial
enterprise
profits
that
provided
the
war
materials
under
cost
plus
contracts
in
world
war
ii.
the
important
points
on
this
are
first;
the
growers
under
this
cost
plus
contract
have
no
control
over
the
costs
of
these
commercial
packing
houses.
second;
the
growers
have
no
control
over
these
commercial
packing
houses
when
they
as
sunkist
members
control
sunkist
management
and
its
policies.
sunkist
argues
title
doesn't
pass
and
i
think
that's
an
idle
argument
because
the
title
passes
at
some
point.
the
contract
specifically
provides
that
it
does
pass
and
they
sell
it,
but
it
passes
at
least
when
it
has
reached
the
supermarket
or
when
the
fruit
have
may
reached
your
honors
at
your
breakfast
table.
the
point
is
they
are
non-growers,
they
are
middlemen
and
they
purchase
their
fruit
or
acquire
it
from
commercial
packing
houses
and
they
have
no
voice
in
fixing
the
cost
of
these
commercial
packing
houses
and
they
have
no
voice
in
the
management
of
sunkist.
sunkist
also
argues
that
capper-volstead
association
could
legally
enter
into
a
contract
such
as
exhibit
b
with
non-grower.
a
grower
or
a
cooperative
could
have
entered
into
this
contract,
perhaps
he
could.
a
capper-volstead
association
no
doubt
and
may
does
enter
in
many
types
of
contracts
with
packers,
packing
houses,
painters,
plumbers,
lawyers,
knowing
the
people,
but
that's
not
the
issue
your
honor.
the
issue
on
this
writ
of
certiorari
is
who
may
comprise
the
membership
of
a
capper-volstead
association,
not
who
may
a
duly
organized
capper-volstead
association
contract
with.
your
honor
another
argument
sunkist
argues
that
it
has
done
a
good
job
for
the
california
citrus
food
industry
that
seems
a
theme
that
pervades
entire
brief.
now
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
the
first
to
admit
that
it
--
sunkist
has
done
a
splendid
job.
for
sunkist,
one
such
job
was
the
elimination
of
other
manufactures
of
orange
product
such
as
general
fruits
corporation,
highland
stanford
corporation.
treesweet
had
to
build
a
plant
in
florida
to
supply
its
demand
for
a
single
strength
juice
in
california,
but
we
also
admit
such
a
fine
job
is
not
compatible
with
the
sherman
act.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
well
yes,
i
am
glad
answer
question.
the
practical
effect
would
be
this.
to
the
extent
of
oranges
i
think
i
said
$13
million
these
would
be
independent
and
may
--
these
oranges
would
have
or
might
have
been
available
to
the
processors.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
sunkist
can
buy
their
oranges
from
packing
houses,
yes,
but
when
they
make
the
members
of
it
then
they
have
a
restrictive
agreement
that
they
cannot
sell
to
anyone
else
and
therefore
you
have
--
have
your
packing
houses
that
this
that
they
are
not
available,
the
oranges
they
control,
they
were
not
available
to
process
that.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
no,
because
for
this
reason,
when
they
made
them
members,
they
do
three
things.
they
eliminate
that
fruit
from
the
availability
to
others.
i
mean
they
can't
bid,
the
members
agree
that
they
supply
all
this
fruit
to
sunkist.
next
when
they
make
the
members,
they
dilute
the
memberships
with
middleman,
those
members
are
the
only
ones,
those
members,
the
councilors,
they
sit
with
the
packers
and
form
the
policy,
and
they
are
commercial
packing
houses.
second,
the
grower
has
no
control
over
the
cost
of
these
commercial
packing
houses,
they
fix
their
own
costs.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
they
can
negotiate
it,
but
it
isn't
cost
driven,
yes,
but
when
they
make
the
members
they
increase
sunkist
control
of
oranges,
i
mean
they
tie
them
up.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
section
was
--
what
your
honor?
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
section
1
trial
was
dismissed
by
a
pretrial
order
in
the
same
order
that
the
court
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes,
in
other
words,
when
we
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
i
think
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yeah,
the
allegation
we
think
it
was
true.
there
were
three
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
no,
we
didn't
dismiss,
the
pretrial
order
of
the
court
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
before
trial
of
the
court
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
court
ordered
it
out.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
no,
on
a
pretrial
order,
when
the
court
decided
that
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
well,
there
was
one
previous
attempt;
first
we
alleged
a
conspiracy
between
sunkist
exchange
orange
and
exchange
lemon.
then
the
court
ruled
that
the
capper-volstead
issue
was
in
favor
of
sunkist.
so
they
said
upon
that
basis,
we
--
the
court
ordered
the
case
combined
to
simply
a
such
motion
section
2
case
mr.
william
h.
henderson
then
the
court
later
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
then
the
court
later,
after
trial
directed
a
verdict
under
the
section
2
charge.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
under
yes
--
as
per
section
1.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
court
said
yes,
it
said
it
could
do
anything
it
wanted
to
do,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
correct
and
it
was
a
nonmember,
they
had
no
exemptions,
there
were
many
things
the
court
could
not
do
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
well,
what
sunkist
could
do?
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
court
rule
exempt.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yeah,
it
says,
the
court
of
appeals
said
even
with
the
exemption
we
had
a
section
2
case.
now,
the
importance
of
the
membership
is
that
this,
that
this
membership
permits
non-packers,
commercial
enterprisers,
the
middleman
to
be
part
of
the
organization
and
it
ties
up
the
fruit
to
that
extent
because
the
agreements
under
which
they
obtained
their
fruit
are
restricted
tie-in
agreement,
you
have
to
give
us
all
your
fruit,
your
product
fruit,
we're
concerned
the
product
fruit,
but
if
you
don't
give
us
your
--
all
your
fruit,
including
your
product
fruit
you
can't
use
the
sunkist
label.
so
that
works
when
they
tied
up
say
$13
million
of
fruit
by
restricted
tie-in
agreements,
they
enhanced
their
control
of
the
california,
arizona
market
of
oranges
to
that
extent.
they
were
able
to
more
effectively
exercise
wrongful
use
of
monopoly
power
and
they
were
more
effectively
able
to
attempt
to
monopolize
under
the
antitrust
laws.
in
other
words,
these
contracts
with
the
members
which
are
in
the
bylaws
of
the
organization,
say
the
packing
house,
the
packing
house
is
the
member
that's
the
only
member
that
sunkist
gets
it's
fruit
from,
but
the
packing
house
goes
out
and
ties
up
contracts
with
non-growers
and
they're
restrictive
contracts
with
growers,
they
tie
them
up
with
growers
and
they
are
restrictive
contracts.
they
have
to
turnover
all
their
fruit.
so
therefore
they
as
a
member
and
these
commercial
packing
houses
were
members
to
the
extent
of
$13
million
of
orange
juice
tied
up
that
much
fruit.
and
that
enabled
them
to
that
extent
to
enlarge
their
control
over
the
oranges
grown
in
california
and
arizona
and
to
that
extent
enable
them
to
attempt
to
monopolize
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes,
and
it
also
provides
that
they
get
paid
$2.50
a
case,
but
the
point
is
your
honor
the
actual
members
of
sunkist
are
the
packing
houses,
that's
who
sunkist
gets
the
oranges
from,
that's
how
oranges
are
marketed
through
packing
house.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes,
well
the
point
on
that
is
your
honor,
that
the
packing
house
agreed
that
all
the
fruit
it
can
tie
up
with
a
turnover
to
the
sunkist
for
marketing.
now
it
enters
into
these
contracts
with
the
growers.
there
is
an
escape
clause
or
a
penalty
that
as
much
as
it
as
it
is
tied
up,
but
it
does
go
--
it
does
go
to
the
packing
house
and
through
their
restrictive
agreement
it
does
go
to
sunkist.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
the
articles
of
association
do
provide
that
that's
their
duty
is
tie
up
fruit
of
the
growers.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
and
i
suppose
they
did
to
the
best
way
they
could
and
that
this
is
the
difficult
part.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes.
it
goes
back
to
say
that
these
--
what
it
emphasis
the
fact
that
these
commercial
packing
houses
they
are
not
controlled
by
their
cooperative,
they
are
looking
out
for
themselves,
they
are
middlemen
and
they
say
we
want
cost
plus
and
then
if
you
are
going
to
take
some
of
the
fruit
away
from
it
whether
you
got
to
pay
us
a
penalty,
but
the
point
is,
under
the
articles
of
association
that
you
are
obligated
that
is
the
packing
house
members
to
tie
up
the
fruit
of
the
growers.
now
this
the
best
perhaps
they
could
tie
up
with
a
commercial
packing
houses.
but
they
--
and
they
do
tie
them
up
except
for
--
except
when
your
honor
they
pay
him
penalty
of
$250
a
ton.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
per
ton
all
the
fruit
used
for
processing
yes.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes,
yeah,
that's
correct.
that's
the
processing
fruit
the
processors
use.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
i
think
that
it
can
be
composed
of
15%
commercial
packing
houses
could
be
composed
of
100%.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yeah.
i
see
no
reason.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
correct.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes.
now
the
legislative
history
and
this
colloquy
between
senator
cummings
and
townsend
and
i
referred
to
this,
they
referred
specifically
to
this
section
and
they
said,
do
you
mean
--
does
that
mean
that
someone
who
in
a
broad
sense
in
producers
of
agriculture
product
like
a
packing
house
or
a
packer
like
my
clients
need
to
produce
some
agriculture
products
or
is
it
restricted
to
farmers
or
actually
who
grow
it,
want
to
grow
the
crop
and
they
said
it
is
restricted
to
farmers
and
i
went
through
that
list
of
legislative
history
and
i
find
very
clearly
that,
that
was
intent
for
the
man
who
tills
the
soil,
the
farmer
who
grows
the
crops,
they
only
could
combine.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
well
had
that
not
been
the
purpose
it
would
have
permitted
packers
to
fix
prices.
it
would
have
permitted
any
man
to
fix
prices.
it
--
the
reason
was
to
protect
the
farmer.
there
wouldn't
be
any
other
reason.
that
was
clear,
the
reason
was
to
let
these
farmers
fix
their
prices
through
a
cooperative.
now
when
i
say
a
farmer
and
the
grower
i
will
concede
that
if
it
is
a
farmer
organization
that
is
the
capper-volstead
association,
it
can
be
a
member
because
basically
then
it
is
a
grower.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
i
didn't
get
the
first
part,
what
was
it
what?
mr.
william
h.
henderson
i
would
have
serious
questions
on
that
because
that's
a
question
we
don't
have
to
answer
because
perhaps
a
corporation
may
be
a
grower
but
these
corporations,
these
packing
houses
were
normally,
mostly
corporations
and
they
did
not
grow
fruit.
so
i
don't
answer
the
question.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes
there
are
about
four
some
odd
percent
who
grow
fruit
and
operate
their
own
packing
houses
and
they
also
are
sunkist
members.
they
supply
about
4%.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
no
we
do
not
take
that
because
we
do
--
i
felt
we
do
not
have
to
because
the
corporations
we
are
involved
with
do
not
grow
fruit
and
therefore
we
don't
have
to
argue
about
the
ones
that
do
grow.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
no
i
am
talking
about
15%
are
normally
corporations,
they
do
not
grow
fruit,
they
are
stipulated
to
be
non-cooperatives.
now
there
are
4%
--
mr.
william
h.
henderson
in
addition.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
that
are
corporations
that
do
grow
fruit
and
operate
packing
houses.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that
additional
3
to
4%.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
only
going
to
take
up
to
few
points.
first
the
stipulation
so
that
we
shall
be
clear
just
what
we
are
speaking
about.
there
were
some
questions
of
whether
we
were
talking
about
non-growers.
now
i
want
to
refer
your
honors
to
page
35
of
the
record.
three
corporate
growers
were
not
concerned
with
the
ones
that
corporation
that
grow
fruit.
they
constitute
for
0.975
by
number
and
for
0.72
by
volume,
but
we
are
concerned
with
item
4,
what
are
called
agency
associations
and
we
call
them
commercial
packing
houses
and
the
stipulation
is
clear
on
that,
they
are
non-growers.
for
example,
agency
associations
constitute
14.91%
by
number
and
49%
by
volume
of
all
associations
in
the
sunkist
system.
the
agency
association
is
normally
a
private
corporation.
such
agency
associations
do
not
qualify
nor
do
they
claim
to
be
cooperative
associations
acting
under
section
1
of
capper-volstead
act.
the
agency
association
furnishes
these
facilities
on
the
independent
contract
basis
and
relate
it
to
net
returns.
a
contract
between
such
an
agency
association
and
it's
growers
which
maybe
deemed
typical
of
such
associations
is
attached
here
to
as
exhibit
b.
further
showing
they're
not
growers,
this
court
may
refer
in
page
41
where
it
defines
the
different
functions,
on
the
second
whole
paragraph
with
regard
to
the
physical
handling
of
fruit,
the
growers
cares
for
the
fruit,
cares
for
the
trees
and
brings
the
citrus
fruit
to
the
point
where
it
is
ready
to
be
picked.
the
packing
house
association
then
normally
sends
its
specialized
crews
into
the
groves
to
pick
the
fruit
and
it
is
stipulated
that
they
obtain
their
fruit
under
exhibit
b
to
the
contract
now,
and
that
provide
the
sale
of
the
fruit.
now,
i'm
also
going
to
mention
mr.
hufstedler's
argument
that
for
the
first
half
of
the
lawsuit
the
member
--
these
commercial
associations
or
these
packing
houses,
all
members
were
not
members.
well,
this
lawsuit
commenced
may
15,
1958.
on
october
3,
the
october
1,
1958
then
all
packing
house
members
became
direct
denominated
members
of
sunkist.
and
may
i
refer
the
court
to
page
3
of
our
brief.
only
the
packing
house
members
have
property
rights
and
interests
in
sunkist.
now,
as
to
the
district
exchange,
they
only
representative,
the
packing
houses
and
that
is
stipulated
here.
even
before
they
were
direct
members,
they
were
indirect
members
through
the
packing
--
through
the
district
exchange.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yeah.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
yes,
correct.
in
other
words
before
october
31
they
were
represented
to
the
district
exchange
which
has
stipulated
to
its
one
of
the
conduits
of
communication
and
representation
between
the
packing
house
association
and
sunkist.
so
before
that
time
they
were
indirect
members.
after
october
1,
1958
and
during
most
of
the
period
of
this
suit
they
became
direct
members
and
they
are
the
only
packing
house
members
that
have
property
rights
and
interests
in
sunkist.
mr.
william
h.
henderson
not
that
i
know
of.
our
discovery
--
this
--
all
i
know
is
up
to
this
--
we
stipulated
that
up
till
1962
during
the
period
encompassed
so
far
that's
how
it
remained.
they
are
all
members,
they're
denominated
members,
they
still
are
the
only
members
who
have
interest
before
that,
realistically
they
were
the
only
members
who
had
interests
in
sunkist.
now,
the
next
argument
is
that
the
growers
receive
all
the
benefits.
well
that
isn't
true.
when
the
packing
house
is
the
capper-volstead
association
then
the
growers
are
in
practical
affect
sunkist
members.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that,
we
think
the
court
implied
that
in
the
winckler
case.
but
when
the
packing
house
is
an
agency
association
or
more
accurately
a
commercial
packing
house
it's
neither
a
grower,
neither
an
association
growers,
it
is
not
in
any
realistic
theory
a
sunkist
member
and
the
grower
does
not
receive
the
benefits
of
cooperative
marketing.
first,
a
grower
is
marketing
his
fruit
through
a
middleman
or
he
--
or
for
his
fruit
he
receives
the
net
returns
from
the
fruit
less
the
cost
of
the
commercial
packing
house
and
he
has
no
control
over
the
cost
of
this
commercial
packing
house.
and
then
there's
a
fixed
fee
per
case
of
fruit,
it's
the
cost
plus
contract,
the
type
of
contract
which
was
so
popular
in
world
war
ii.
second,
the
agency
association
over
which
the
grower
which
belongs
to
it
has
no
control,
that
association
is
the
member
that
sits
in
the
sunkist
meetings.
he
is
the
member
who
controls
sunkist
in
the
final
analysis
and
he
determines
the
policy
that
is
all
the
packing,
whether
it's
the
benevolent
or
whether
it's
predatory.
now,
your
honor
in
conclusion,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
provisos.
we
are
concerned
with
the
first
sentence
of
the
first
section.
the
first
sentence
says
who
may
be
a
member
of
a
capper-volstead
association
and
the
history
is
clear
that
is
the
farmer.
it
is
stipulated
that
these
agency
associations
are
not
cooperative
so
that
they
do
not
comply
with
provisos
one,
two
or
three,
we
don't
have
to
argue
that
because
they
stipulate,
they
don't
comply.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
this
was
the
intent
of
congress
and
this
court's
decision
in
milk
producers
association
versus
united
states
stated
this
to
be
the
intent
of
congress
and
your
honor
in
the
gordon
(ph)
case
this
court
stated
the
persons
to
whom
the
capper-volstead
act
applies
are
defined
in
section
1
as
producers
of
agricultural
products.
in
the
milk
producers
case,
the
court
said
that
congress
intended
actual
farmers
that
was
the
intent
to
take
advantage
of
this
act.
now
under
that
situation
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
it's
settled
law.
it
is
not
a
judicial
function
to
rewrite
the
language
of
a
statute
clearly,
ambiguity
and
permit
non-growers,
commercial
packing
houses
to
organize
capper-volstead
association,
that
is
our
contention
that
it's
only
for
farmers.
well,
we
believe
this
language
means
what
it
says
and
it
applies
all
associations,
even
sunkist,
thank
you.
