chief
justice

number
66,
case-swayne
company
incorporated,
petitioner
versus
sunkist
growers
incorporated.
mr.
henderson,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
to
be
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
follow
that
brief
now,
did
it?
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
if
it
wasn't
for
the
exemption
you
would
have
justiciable
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
m.
hufstedler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you,
the
whole
territory
that
sunkist
serves
is
compact
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
in
arizona?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
the
district
exchange
has
what
relation
to
sunkist?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
this
be
oversimplifying
to
say
that
the
entire
--
under
the
capper-volstead
act
that
the
entire
membership
of
the
organization
could
be
corporations
for
profit
on
the
same
basis
that
these
packing
concerns
are
and
that
there
were
no
growers
in
it
at
all.
but
still
according
to
the
method
of
organization
the
present
time,
the
profits
all
went
to
growers,
do
you
think
that
could
be
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
there
some
language
right
after
that
that
might
bear
upon
its
construction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
read
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
read
the
rest
of
the
language,
so
that
connects
that
all
up
so
we
won't
have
to
detach?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
such
producers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hufstedler,
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
what
control
have
the
growers
themselves
in
your
sunkist
system
for
determining
what
the
cost
and
fixed
fee
are
to
be
in
this
relationship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
organization
bargains
with
the
agency?
chief
justice
earl
warren
being
a
two
and
three
acre
farmer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understood
it
the
organization
that
determines
the
policies
for
sunkist
is
composed
of
these
agencies
and
they
are
the
ones
who
would
govern
i
presume
in
determining
whether
they
were
being
given
a
fair
price
or
were
being
charged
to
fair
price
by
the
agencies
for
the
services
they
performed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
haven't
you
got
the
agencies
setting
in
two
positions,
they're
on
these
negotiations,
they're
affecting
the
price
for
themselves
as
agencies
and
then
they
are
determining
whether
that's
a
fair
price
on
behalf
of
the
growers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
is
it
a
man
who
has
two
acres
or
three
acres
of
oranges
as
lot
of
them
do,
going
to
be
able
to
bargain
with
a
lot
of
these
big
packing
houses
as
to
how
much
they
will
charge
for
processing
his
fruit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
you
said
he
must
do
it
individually.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
maybe
two
answers
to
that
one
of
them
i
see
that
he
is
in
the
community
where
there's
only
one
packing
house
and
you
yourself
said
a
little
while
ago
that
in
some
parts
of
california
and
arizona
that
would
probably
be
true,
but
we
don't
take
--
maybe
we
shouldn't
the
concentrated
area
like
orange
county
and
san
bernardino
county
where
there
are
so
many
of
them.
but
the
other
answer
might
be
this,
i
wonder
if
it
is
that
15%
of
these
packing
houses
are
now
in
sunkist.
suppose
that
sunkist
incorporated
50%
more
of
the
packing
houses
into
it's
agency
or
organization
having
65%
of
all
oranges
in
the
district.
and
by
that
time
the
packing
houses
were
in
a
clearly
dominant
position
in
the
industry
and
suppose
they
chose
to
raise
the
cost
of
processing
to
the
grower
and
the
growers
didn't
like
it,
but
they
couldn't
do
anything
about
it.
wouldn't
that
tend
towards
monopoly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
why
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it
isn't
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
there's
only
--
if
it
gets
to
a
dominant
position
what
choice
has
he
got?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
orange
growers
are
there
in
southern
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
must
have
some
idea.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
because
the
orange
growers
going
out
of
the
existence
or
housing
i
suppose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
growers,
are
there
any
growers
in
that
119?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
would
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
are
the
4%
of
the
growers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
80%?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
would
like
to
know
one
thing
more
before
you
get
to
that.
about
15%
of
these
packing
houses
now
are
in
sunkist.
suppose
the
figured
were
just
reverse
85%
of
them
were
in
the
sunkist
and
the
other
15%
out,
would
that
change
your
position
any
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
situation
--
i
mean
with
the
organizational
system
just
as
it
is,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
argument
if
the
figures
were
reversed
and
85%
of
the
product
were
agency
and
agency
controlled
and
15%
without?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
to
answer
that,
couldn't
they
say
well
--
but
you
wouldn't
have
rights
through
our
board
of
directors
to
determine
the
policy
of
the
organization
and
at
the
same
time
have
the
right
as
a
packing
house
to
fix
your
price
for
dealing
with
us
at
any
level
which
you
wish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
houses?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
are
association
of
packing
houses?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean
unfair?
who
reviews
it,
the
board
of
directors?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah
and
those
are
the
packing
houses
themselves,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
are
passing
upon
how
much
they
are
going
to
get
for
their
services
as
packing
houses
and
on
the
other
hand
between
the
right
of
the
grower
to
get
the
profits
that
result
of
this
system
which
you
speak
of,
what
interest
do
you
think
they
would
favor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
you
just
told
me
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
are
85%
of
these
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
the
other
15%.
