justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
go
head.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
owns
the
packing
houses?
justice
byron
r.
white
profit
making
corporations?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
really
the
point,
as
long
as
they
were
doing
something
with
these
people
inside
as
members
which
they
could
do
by
contract
with
outsiders?
isn't
that
justice
fortas
[voice
overlap]
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference?
you
may
still
have
a
completely
other
rather
sterile
argument
on
at
least
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
certainly
have
control
in
the
sense
that
their
cost
gets
too
high,
they're
not
going
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
have
you
--
could
you
just
clear
me
up
for
a
moment
because
i
think
it's
relevant
what
we're
talking
about,
was
the
section
1
charge
in
this
case
dismiss
the
during
the
trial
or
before
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
section
1
charge
dismissed
before
trial
or
during
trial
or
after
evidence
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
dismissed
--
is
it
dismissed
on
the
assumption
that
that
no
matter
what
is
alleged
about
the
dealings
with
this
member,
this
capper-volstead
association
is
exempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
do
we
take
--
in
assessing
this
do
we
take
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
as
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
charge
was
dismissed,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
got
--
there's
certainly
a
whole
series
of
allegations,
there's
complaint
which
were
dismiss
before
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean,
it
was
dismissed
before
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
[voice
overlap]
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
any
event
the
court
must
have
said
that
without
having
a
trial
on
these
issues,
even
assuming
everything
you
say
is
true
in
this
complaint,
i
nevertheless
dismiss
it
because
this
association
is
exempt
under
section
1
of
sherman
act
charge,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
alright
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
as
far
as
the
section
1
charge
is
concerned
the
court
rule
that
no
matter
what
was
alleged
in
the
complaint,
and
no
matter
what
your
fruit
might
be
under
section
1
that
the
association
was
exempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
you're
saying
that
anything
--
that
the
association
could
do
anything
they
wanted
to
inside
the
association
as
long
as
that
profit
making
entity
was
a
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
might
be
some
things
that
if
it
was
a
nonmember,
it
obviously
couldn't
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
you
about
what
difference
does
it
make,
if
what
they're
doing
with
this
packer
as
a
member,
they
could
do
with
that
packer
as
a
nonmember
and
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
what
if
some
of
the
things
that
you
alleged
they
were
doing
as
a
member,
they
could
not
do
if
the
packer
was
a
nonmember
and
at
least
the
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
the
court
ruled
that
that
no
matter
what,
no
matter
what
is
alleged
about
the
dealings
with
that
member
packer,
that
the
association
is
exempt
under
section
1
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
make
a
profit?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
inherits
the
benefit
of
his
shareholders?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
15%?
i
thought
--
as
i
understood
it,
it
was
15%
of
the
membership?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
could
you
agree
would
they
accept
an
outsider
that
you
wouldn't
sell
to
anybody
else
in
any
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
agree
--
but
he
may
ask
you
to
agree
not
to
sell
any
oranges
to
anybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
you
say
that
if
he
wasn't
--
that
if
he
was
--
if
this
independent
suddenly
was
made
a
member,
do
you
think
he
could
do
either
one
of
those
two
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
he
became
a
member?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
what
i
just
asked
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
member
is
the
one
we
would
just,
that
you
ask
those
other
--
those
other
questions
about,
the
independent
factor
outside
you
said
we
could
make
these
same
arrangements
with
this
particular
member
who
suddenly
becomes
a
non-member?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
because
you
also,
if
you
became
a
non-member,
could
you
also
say
to
him,
don't
you
deal
with
anybody
else.
could
he
say
to
you
don't
you
deal
with
anybody
else,
could
you
both
agree
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
he's
an
outsider?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
growers?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
80%
is
covered
by
winckler?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that
this
can
be,
sunkist
can
be
an
association
of
cooperative?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
only
problem
you're
going
to
try
are
those
which
arise
under
section
2,
as
far
as
i
can
see
section
1
is
out
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what
the
part
of
the
deal
decided
that,
isn't
--
that
sunkist
was
immune
by
reason
of
capper-volstead
for
any
liability
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
explain
then
what
is
it
that,
what
practices
there
are
that
you
want
shielded
by
an
exemption
and
what
difference,
you
apparently
are
arguing
to
some
extent
you
start
violating
the
anti
trust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
you
have
an
exemption
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
only
concerns
sunkist,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
sunkist
were
held
unqualified
it
wouldn't
mean
that
the
underlying
cooperatives
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
question
might
be
raised
but
it
wouldn't
be
decided
by
the
sunkist
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
what
you
--
i
take
at
your
position
is
it
if
sunkist
is
qualified
that
there
are
no
transactions
among
the
members
of
sunkist
or
any
of
its
subsidiary
organizations
which
would
violation
of
the
anti
trust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
an
organization
you
are
exempt
under
anti
trust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
inside
the
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
still
concede
that
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
there
is
nothing
you
could
do
to
each
other
inside
the
association
without
dealing
with
outsider,
that
would
violate
the
anti
trust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
when
the
packing
house
became
a
member
as
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
all
they
did.
they
just
become
a
member.
it
still
retained
it's
same
corporate
structure,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
just
a
separate
corporation
which
was
members
of
sunkist?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
has
something
else
happened
since
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
go
head.
justice
byron

who
