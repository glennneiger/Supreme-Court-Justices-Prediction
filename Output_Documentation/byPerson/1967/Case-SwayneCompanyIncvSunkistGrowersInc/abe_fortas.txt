justice
abe
fortas
for
all
of
those
15%
minced
and
processing
oranges?
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
of
them
are
engaged
processing
oranges?
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
15%
yeah.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
now
representing
to
us
that
all
of
the
15%
were
engaged
in
the
packing
or
canning
or
freezing
of
oranges?
justice
abe
fortas
i
assume
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
assume
that
you
will
address
yourself
at
some
point
to
the
question
of
whether
they
are
mere
agents
or
they
are
growers?
justice
abe
fortas
well
suppose,
suppose
the
commercial
packing
houses
are
eliminated
as
members
of
sunkist,
what
practical
effect
would
that
have,
perhaps
i
shouldn't
ask
you
that
question?
justice
abe
fortas
or
couldn't
sunkist
buy
them,
buy
the
oranges
anyway
from
the
packing
houses
or
make
a
contract
with
the
packing
houses
by
which
the
packing
houses
would
agree
to
sell
to
sunkist
all
of
their
oranges
that
they
process
for
the
growers?
would
there
be
anything
wrong
with
that
under
capper-volstead?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
important,
not
even
sure
not
relevant
but
i
notice
article
4
of
the
exhibit
b,
the
agreement
between
the
grower
and
the
packing
house
and
that
does
provide
that
mechanism
by
which
the
grower
might
be
able
to
sell
his
crop
in
bulk
that
they
grow,
if
he
can
get
a
higher
price
for
it.
i
notice
that
it
says
if
the
packing
house
agrees
that
the
price
is
higher
than
you
are
likely
to
get
from
the
packing
house
operation,
but
in
any
event
the
theory
that
at
least
the
contract
would
make
it
possible
for
your
client
to
outbid
the
packing
the
house
for
the
fruit
of
grower,
of
growers.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
understand
that,
but
the
problem
of
your
complaint
is
that
the
arrangement
is
not
merely
technical
and
vulnerable,
but
then
it
also,
i
shouldn't
say
the
government,
you
complaint
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
saying
that
you
are
making
to
us
not
merely
a
technical
point,
but
a
point
that
has
some
functional
substance?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
thought
you
are
perhaps
inadvertently
over
stated,
didn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
thought
you
had
perhaps
inadvertently
overstated
the
extent
to
which
the
grower
is
tied
into
the
packing
house
contract,
there
is
an
escape
clause
for
what
its
worth?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
fact
there
is
in
an
escape
clause.
justice
abe
fortas
now
wait
a
minute
the
penalty
is
$2.50
not
per
box
but
per
ton?
justice
abe
fortas
$2.50
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
it's
a
large
corporate
farm
and
suppose
that
it
also
holds
and
operates
packing
house,
will
that
in
your
judgment
disqualify
from
membership
in
capper-volstead
in
the
association?
justice
abe
fortas
it
is
a
large
corporate
operation
that
actually
grows
oranges
or
whatever
and
suppose
that
also
owns
and
operates
a
packing
house.
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
any
of
them
that
do
grow
fruit?
justice
abe
fortas
well
is
it
your
submission
that
those
operations
which
grow
fruit
and
also
operate
packing
houses
are
not
qualified
for
membership?
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
that
mean,
does
that
mean
that
you
are
talking
about
a
11%?
justice
abe
fortas
in
addition.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
description
apply
equally
to
the
cooperative
packing
houses
and
to
the
agency
association?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
distribution
of
proceeds?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
that
during
the
first
half
of
the
period
covered
by
this
lawsuit
the
only
members
of
sunkist
were
the
exchanges,
district
exchanges?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
growers
were
not
themselves
were
not
members?
justice
abe
fortas
and
still
they
are
not.
justice
abe
fortas
they
are
only
members
of
sunkist
via
the
district
exchanges
and
the
agencies,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
individuals
were
--
the
individual
nominated
by
the
district
exchanges
--
justice
abe
fortas
were
the
members?
justice
abe
fortas
and
those
--
some
of
those
members
i
suppose
were
not
themselves
growers?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
[inaudible]
anticipate,
but
i
assume
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
doesn't
the
section
1
of
the
act
contemplates
that
the
growers
would
be
the
members
and
isn't
that
the
purpose
of
defining
that
no
member
should
have
more
than
one
vote?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
of
--?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
sunkist
has
9,000
members.
justice
abe
fortas
it
gets
to
the
heart
of
our
problem
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
they
have
9,000
members
and
it's
very
different
when
you
say
that
9,000
growers
just
in
terms
of
the
statute,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
for
the
price,
i
am
talking
about
the
statute.
now,
how
many
members
has
sunkist
got,
members?
justice
abe
fortas
119
members?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
service
about
9,000
growers.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
it's
essential
to
define
growers
that
way
that
is
say,
that
is
to
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
growers,
that
if
you
are
going
to
--
that
any
definition
of
growers
would
have
to
admit
into
that
select
company?
justice
abe
fortas
who
owns
a
couple
of
acres
even
though
he
may
have
an
investment
of
$100
million
in
packing
plant
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
the
law
from
the
--
is
a
classical
phrase.
justice
abe
fortas
well
isn't
that
something
like
saying
that
the
farmer
has
a
great
deal
of
control
over
[inaudible]
of
california
packing
corporation,
the
price
he
gets
because
if
he
didn't,
they
don't
pay
him
what
he
thinks
he
is
entailed
to,
you
sell
it
to
somebody
else,
it's
about
what
your
are
saying.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
difficulty
here
is
that
sunkist
has
a
sort
of
vast
market
powers?
justice
abe
fortas
yeah
may
i
address
a
moment
and
ask
you
whether
there
have
been
attempts
in
the
congress
to
obtain
legislative
clarification
to
this
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
when
it
comes
to
[inaudible]
of
the
congress
from
time
to
time?
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
not
talk
about
cooperatives,
i
am
talking
about
[inaudible]
congress
in
some
years
to
clarify
this
problem
of
what

membership
requirements
of
the
capper-volstead

justice
