justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
different
from
putting
it
in.
i
mean,
you
want
to
change
what
you...
what
you
allege,
that...
that
it's
mandated
by
the
government
to
simply
the
government,
although
it
had
authority
to
eliminate,
did
not
do
so?
if...
you
know,
that's
a
different...
different
assertion.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
assume
it's
the
latter
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
cases
came
from
the
days
when
we
were
also
quite
willing
to
imply
federal
causes
of
action
in
statutes
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
government,
you
know,
10b-5
and
things
of
that
sort.
i
thought
we
had
put
all
of
that
behind
us.
you
want
us
to
go
back
to
that
bygone
age.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
sort
of
queer
terminology
anyway.
congress
has
already
decided
that
there
should
be
federal
jurisdiction.
it
would
seem
very
strange
for
congress
to
say
this
strengthens
the
case
for
federal...
what
do
you
mean
the
case
for
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
prescribe
federal
jurisdiction.
i...
you
know,
i'm
not
a
fan
of
legislative
history,
but
i...
i
don't
find
that
particular
piece
very
much
against
you.
in
fact,
it
may
be
just...
just
the
opposite.
it
may
be...
it's
lawyers'
language,
you
know.
we
don't
know
whether
there's
federal
jurisdiction
or
not,
but
this
will
make
a
better
case
for...
you
know,
for
the
other
side.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but...
but...
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
sloppy
way
to
put
it,
don't
you
think?
maybe
what
congress
should
have
said,
although
congress
doesn't
always
speak
precisely,
is
that
any...
any
state
law
which
contradicts
a
provision
of
the
contract
on
these
particular
subjects
is
preempted.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i'll
put
it
differently.
all
state
laws
relating
to
subjects
that
are
covered
in
the
contract
are
preempted.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
there's
a
dispute
in
the...
in
the
lawsuit
about
whether
a
particular
benefit
to
which
one
party
was
entitled
under
the
contract
has
been
waived.
okay?
that's
the
issue.
is
that
issue
to
be
decided
by
federal
law
or
by
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the...
i'm
talking
about
the
claim,
the
claim
made
by
an
individual
against
the
carrier.
and...
and
it
is
asserted
that
this
claim
should
have
been
made
sooner.
it
has
been
waived
by
not
having
been
brought
forward
sooner.
okay?
that's...
that's
the
hypothetical.
do...
do
you
think
that
that...
that
is
governed
by
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
waiver
occurred
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
text...
the
text
only...
only
says,
shall...
which
relate
to
the
nature,
provision,
or
extent
of
coverage
or
benefits.
extent
of
coverage
or
benefits.
i
don't
know
that
that
relates
to
any
of
them.
it
relates
to
whether
the
benefit
that
was
covered
has
been
waived.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
speak
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
you're
not
saying
that...
that
federal
law
is...
is
pervasive
here,
that
it
covers
the...
the
entire...
the
entire
suit
between
the
claimant
and
the
insurer.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
in
that
respect,
doesn't
it
differ
from
erisa?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
gong
to
make
a
lot
of
trouble
for
us.
we're
going
to
have
to
sort
out
which
of
these
things
are
covered
by
state
law
and
which
aren't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
wrote
boyle
and
what
i
thought
i
was
saying
was
that
the
common--
[laughter]
--was
that
the
common
law,
federal
common
law
precluded,
preempted
any
state
law
which
contradicted
this
contract.
now,
you
can...
you
can
put
that
in
a
sloppy
fashion
by
saying
that
the
contract
preempted
state
law,
but
it
wasn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
we
thought
it
was
the
contract
that
preempted
state
law.
it
was
federal
common
law
which
said
that
the
contract...
that
any
provision
in
state
law
which
contradicts
the
contract
is
preempted
by
federal
common
law.
and
you
can
read
this
statute
the
same
way.
it's
a
sloppy
way
of
putting
it,
but
what
it
means
is
federal
law
preempts
any
state
provision
that
is
contrary
to
a
provision
of
the
contract--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which...
which
is
certainly
constitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
isn't
always
precise,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
uniform
in
both
alaska
and
new
york,
they
are
subject
to
the...
to
the
blue
cross
waiver
of
attorney's
fees
or
not.
they're
being
treated
uniformly.
i
don't
see
that
that's
disuniform.
what
is
disuniform,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
you
have
an
employee
who
wins
a
judgment
in
alaska
and
he
gets
to
keep
all
his
money
because
alaska
law
says
the
reimbursement
provision
is...
is
invalid,
and
then
you
have
a
federal
employee
in
texas
who...
who
gets
a...
wins
the
same
tort
lawsuit,
and
he
has
to
turn
over
to
blue
cross
all
the...
the
portion
of
his
recovery
that
would
cover
the
outlay
that
blue
cross
has
made.
that's
disuniformity.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government...
the
government
as
amicus?
the
government
as
amicus.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
could
say
the
same
about...
about
any
recovery,
that
a
certain
percentage
in
taxes
will
go
to
the
federal
treasury
i...
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
guess
you
can
be...
depending
upon
how
detailed
the
opm
contract
is,
you
can
be
consistent
with
that
contract
and
still
have
an
enormous
amount
of
variation
from
one
to
another.
it
depends
entirely
upon
whether
the
opm
contract
is
entirely
comprehensive.
if
it
covers
every
jot
and
tittle,
then
i
guess
you
can't
be
consistent
with
it
and
different.
but
if
it's...
if
it's
sort
of
bare
bones,
you...
you
could
be
consistent
with
that
and
have
a
lot
of
variation,
couldn't
you?
