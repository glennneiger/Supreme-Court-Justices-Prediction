mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
empire's
complaint
in
this
case
raises
a
federal
claim.
as
a
result,
it
arises
under
federal
law.
this
case
involves
fringe
benefits
for
federal
employees
provided
by
the
federal
government.
the
case
involves
enforcement
of
a
federal
government
contract.
the
same
contract
is
rooted
in
a
federal
statute,
and
the
money
collected
here
will
go
to
the
federal
treasury.
nonetheless,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
case
belonged
in
state
court
to
be
governed
by
state
law.
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
in
particular,
this
case
concerns
the
reimbursement
of
health
benefits
by
a
federal
employee
to
his
federal
government
health
benefit
plan,
which
is
known
as
the
service
benefit
plan.
that
plan
is
governed
federal
employees
health
benefits
act,
fehba,
and
is
established
through
a
federal
government
contract.
in
this
case,
empire
paid
approximately
$157,000
in
benefits
for
certain
injuries
suffered
by
joseph
mcveigh,
but
the
plan
conditioned
the
payment
of
those
benefits
on
reimbursement
in
the
event
that
a
recovery
was
made
from
a
third
party.
those
terms
are
part
of
the
government
contract,
the
reimbursement
terms.
thereafter--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--under
the
statute...
justice
ginsburg,
under
the
statute,
the
office
of
personnel
management
is
charged
with
selecting
the
benefits
and
exclusions
for
this
particular
program
and
for
this
particular
plan.
the
statutory
section
is
8902(d).
and
those
terms
are...
opm
has
the
final
authority
over
those
terms
and
those
terms
are
placed
in
a
statement
of
benefits
which
the...
which
this
statute
also
says
shall
become
part
of
the
contract
and
are
attached
and
incorporated
into
the
contract.
so
the
final
authority
over
the
benefits
and
the
exclusions--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--well,
it's...
our
obligations
are
through
the
contract,
and
our
only
obligations
here
are
the
ones
in
the
contract.
and
that
contract...
that
provision
is
in
the
contract.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
we
were...
we
were
mandated
to
enforce
that
provision.
if
the
government
wanted
that
provision
out,
it
had
the
final
authority
to
take
it
out,
and
it
would
only
have
been
included
if,
as
a
matter
of
authorization,
opm
wanted
it
in
there.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
the...
i
think
it
makes
no
difference.
the
fact
of
the
reality
is
that
it's
in
the
contract.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
the
reality
is
that
the...
these
reimbursement
terms
are
in
all
the
contracts
essentially
of
the
fehba
carriers,
and
as
a
result,
i
think
it
can
be
assumed
that
it's
the
policy
of
the
government
that
they
should
be
in
here.
and
the
result
of
them
is
that
they
save
the
government
money.
so
it
does
make
good
government
policy
to
have
these
provisions
in...
in
the
contracts
to
begin
with.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
i
think
the
court's
decision
in
jackson
transit
sets
up
the
framework
for
that,
and
that
is,
that
congress
did
assume
there
would
be
a
contract
cause
of
action,
but--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--it
has
not
been
applied
again
since
then,
but
we
would
say
it's
settled
law
as
a
result.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
well,
it's
four
or
five
cases
that
jackson
transit
was
built
on,
for
instance,
the
machinists
case
v.
central
airlines,
which
came
out
of
the
1960's.
in
those
cases,
for
instance,
they...
the
principle
is
simple
and
it's
a
strong
one,
and
that
is
that
congress
assumes
that
a...
when
it
calls
for
the
creation
of
a...
a
contract
in
a
statute,
that
it
will
be
enforceable
just
as
with
ordinary
contracts.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
the...
the
court
in
jackson
transit
specifically
differentiated
between
congress
assuming
there
was
a
contract
cause
of
action
whenever
it
calls
for
the
creation
of
a
contract
and
separately
implying
a
cause
of
action.
that's
different
because
that...
that
has
to...
in
doing
that,
the
court
has
to
create
a
cause
of
action
in
the
first
place,
but
congress
is
assumed
to
want
contracts
to
be
enforceable
when
it
calls
for
the
creation
of
the
contracts
in
a
federal
statute.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
no.
we're
talking
about
the
contract
between
us
and
the
government
because
it's
that
contract
that
contains
the
reimbursement
terms,
and
when
the
enrollee
enrolls
in
the
federal
program,
he
or
she
takes
on
the
obligation
of
complying
with
all
the
terms
of
the
government
contract.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
because
the...
the
underlying
terms
are
part
of
the
government
contract
and--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--the
subcontract?
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
i
would
not
say
it's
a
contract
with
the
government,
and
that's
not
our
situation.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
it's
not
a
government
contract.
the
government
contract
is
the
contract
between
the
party
with
the
government,
and
that's
what
we
have
here
and
that's
what
we're
seeking
to
enforce.
but
i
would
point
out
that
cases
like
jackson
transit
and
the
central
airlines
case...
the
case...
the
party
suing
wasn't
really
suing
on
the
contract
even.
it
was...
the
case
emanated
from
the
contract,
and
as
a
result,
the
court,
nonetheless,
held
it
arose
under
federal...
federal
law.
in
this
case,
the...
the
case
is
directly
on
the
contract
itself.
so
it's
a
much
closer
connection
to
the
government
terms.
under
the--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--justice
ginsburg,
every
other
type
of
claim
under
this
program
is
in
federal
court
already,
denials
of
benefits
cases,
disputes
between
the
carrier
and
the
united
states.
only
a
sliver
of
lawsuits,
these
reimbursement
suits,
are...
are
left.
and
it
would
be
anomalous
to...
for
congress
to
have
wanted
those
to
be
in
state
court.
but
even
aside
from
that,
a
federal
forum
offers
the--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--the
reality
is
that
a
straightforward
federal
lawsuit
and
a
federal
rule
that
these...
these
reimbursement
provisions
are
straightforwardly
enforceable
through
federal
claims
means
that
they
will...
the
reimbursement
will
be
collected
efficiently
and
correctly.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
conceivably,
but
the
federal
question
statute
allows
us
to
raise
federal
claims
in
federal
court,
and
through
it,
congress
has
determined
that
if
the
case
turns
on
federal
law,
that
the
federal
forum
is
an
appropriate
forum
for
that.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
no,
because
in
many
states...
many
states
don't
allow
reimbursement
altogether.
they
have
anti
subrogation
policies
as
well,
and
the
reality
is,
is
that
what--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--yes,
and
we've
fought
many
battles
on
those
fronts
in
the
state
courts.
and
the
reality
is
that
the
federal
forum
with
its
familiarity
with
federal
law,
its
solicitude
towards
federal
law
is
the
appropriate
forum
in
these
cases,
more
so
than
the
state
court.
and
what
may
seem
like
an
efficient--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--well,
no
conflict
is
required,
for
instance,
under
the
jackson
transit
analysis.
the
analysis
is,
is
this
a
pervasively
federal
regime
to
start
with,
and
if
so,
it's
a
federal
claim
whether
there's
a
conflict
or
not.
and
so
a
conflict
is
really
unnecessary.
but
the
other
point
is
that
with
the--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--your
honor,
there
is
no...
there's
no
requirement
in
the
preemption
provision
either
for
a
conflict.
i
mean,
congress
went
back
to
the...
to
the
drafting
table
in
1998
and
said,
we
want
state
law
to
be
preempted
whether
or
not
there's
a
conflict
in
this
particular
situation.
so--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--well,
first
of
all,
there
have...
there
was
no
dispute
whatsoever
that
these
types
of
cases
could
be
brought
in
federal
court
in
1998.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
yes,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--there
had
been
no
dispute
about
whether
reimbursement
claims
could
be
brought
in
federal
court.
the
courts...
the
courts
were
in
agreement
on
that.
what
there
was
a
dispute
about
was
whether
denials
of
benefits
cases
could
be
removed
from
state
court
to
federal
court.
and
what
congress
did
was
it
followed
the
erisa
model
and
changed
the
preemption
provision
because
the
preemption
provision
was
what
had
been
giving
the
courts
problems
about
the
removal
issue.
and
so
congress
did,
i
think,
what
the
courts
told
it
to
do,
was
get
rid
of
some
language
in
the
preemption
provision
that
is
hampering
federal
jurisdiction.
congress
did
that
and
created
federal
jurisdiction.
nonetheless,
now
we
come
up
with
a
new
dispute
that
had
never
been
a
problem
before--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--i
don't
think--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--i
think
congress
enacted
the
statute
in
1995
against
the
backdrop
of...
of
settled
law
that
federal
programs
are
typically
litigated
in
federal
court.
what
happened,
though,
was
that
the
states
started...
started
enacting
provisions
in
the
area
and
congress
went
to
work
in
1978
and
enacted
a
preemption
provision
to
reemphasize
what
i...
what
it
believed
in
the
first
instance.
then
in
1998,
after
courts
continued
even
to
interpret
the
preemption
provision
narrowly,
they
went
back
to
the...
they
went
back
to
the...
to
the
statute
and
they
strengthened
it
even
further
to
make
it
absolutely
clear.
so
i
think
what
we
have
is
a--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--but
the
provision
doesn't
read
simply
that
state
laws
defining
benefits
shall
be
preempted.
it
reads
state
laws
relating
to
the
extent
of
coverage
or
the
nature
or
provision
of
coverage,
benefits,
or
payments
with
respect
to
benefits.
and
so
it
covers
a
broad
array
of
things
other
than
simply
mandated
benefit
statutes.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
well,
i
believe
there
are
many
other
statutes
in
the
benefits
area
involving
the
federal
government
from
long
term
care
to
miliary
benefits
which
have
a
similar
preemption
provision.
i
think
it--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--it
said
that
originally,
and
the
courts
interpreted
that
to
so
narrowly
that
congress
took
that
out.
it
took
the
contradiction
part
out.
there
was
an
inconsistency
requirement
in
the
statute.
congress
took
it
out
specifically
to
knock
out
even
supplementary
or--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--and
i
would
say
that
that's...
that
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
provision,
i
think
intended
something
on
those
lines.
the
provision
is,
in
fact,
the
result
of
several
different
amendments
and
it
reads
the
way
it
does
as
a
result
of
the
amendments.
and
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
it
is,
your
honor,
under
the
grable
case
that
the
court
issued
last
year.
a
state
law
claim
that
turns
on
the
construction
of
federal
law,
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law,
is
removable
to
federal
court
and
arises
under
federal
law
in
the
first
place.
i
wanted
to
address
justice
souter's
question
of
whether
opm
does
approve
the
contract.
there's
no
individual
contract...
excuse
me...
between
blue
cross
and
any
individual
enrollee.
the
statement
of
benefits
is
part
of
the
government
contract.
it
is
attached
at
appendix
a
and
the
terms
of
the
contract,
the
master
contract,
specifically
say
that
in
sections
2.2
and
2.5,
that
the
benefits
shall
be...
and...
and
reimbursement
terms
as
well...
shall
be
consistent
with
and
incorporated
by
the
statement
of
benefits,
which
is
attached.
and
so
it
is
part
of
the
contract.
there's
no
separate
contract
here.
it's
one--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--the
same
brochure.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
they...
by
enrolling,
they
bind
themselves
to
the
contract.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
absolutely.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
under
state
law,
and
it
should
not.
and
we
are...
it
is
a
uniform
system
across
the
country,
and
the...
the
carrier
is
bound
to
apply
those
terms,
particularly
the
reimbursement
terms,
consistently
and
ethically
across
the
country.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
section
4.1
of
the
contract
says
that.
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
well--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--in
the
first
instance,
our
claim
is
an
enforcement
claim
for
the
contract.
the
contract
itself
and
the
common
law
that
surrounds
it
are...
are
federal
law,
and
as
a
result,
we--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--well,
but
there
are,
for
instance,
seven
states
that
wouldn't
allow
us
to
bring
the
cause
of
action
in
the
first
place,
and
that's
why
we
need
to
go
back
to
the
question
of
whether
the
claim
itself
is
federal
in
nature.
and
under
the
jackson
transit
or
clearfield
trust
analogies,
the
law
at
the
start,
the
cause
of
action,
the
claim
itself
is
federal
in
nature,
and
you
don't
need
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
vessel
of
a
state
law
claim--
mr.
anthony
f.
shelley
--well,
the
contract
itself
is
federal
law.
it...
it
is
a...
it
is
tantamount
to
a
regulation
that
the
government
has
selected
the
terms
of,
and
as
a
result,
it
should
be
treated
as
federal
law.
and...
and
cases,
franchise
tax
board,
on
which...
on
which
grable
relies
and
the
earlier
cases...
we...
we
would
say
those
reach
a
similar
result.
one
other
point
i
wanted
to
address
was
this
issue
of
whether
this
attorney's
fees
question
is
different
in
the
master
contract
or
the
statement
of
benefits.
it's
not.
the
master
contract
addresses
the
question
of
whether
we
can
deduct
our
own
attorney's
fees
from
the
recovery
before
we
give
the
money
to
the
federal
treasury.
the
statement
of
benefits
governs
the
question
of
whether
we...
we
will
deduct
for
attorney's
fees
when
we
collect
the
claim
from
the
subscriber.
