mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
an
action
to
enforce
the
terms
of
a
fehba
contract
is
a
federal
action
because
the
rights
and
duties
in
fehba
contracts
are
federal
in
nature
under
the
jackson
transit
inquiry.
the
federal
nature
of
the
rights
and
duties
comes
both
from
the
context
in
which
fehba
operates
and
also
from
the
terms
of
the
express
preemption
provision.
briefly--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
guess
that
seems
like
an
unlikely
outcome,
given
that
under
the
express
terms
of
the
preemption
provision,
it's
clear
that
the
contract
terms
are
matters
of
federal
law
in
the
sense
that
federal
law
dictates
that
they
govern
over
state
law.
and
if
we
know
that
federal
law
provides
a
substantive
rule
of
decision
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
the
contract,
it
seems
anomalous
to
impute
to
congress
the
intention
that
those
federal
rights
and
duties
should
be
litigated
solely
in
a
state
court
action.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
they
didn't
do
that,
but
i
think
as
jackson
transit
explains,
it's...
it's
different
in
the
contract
context
than
in
your
standard
implied
cause
of
action
context
for
the
following
reason.
when
congress
specifically
contemplates
the
construction
of
contracts,
as
it
did
in
fehba,
it
clearly
contemplates
that
those
contracts
will
be
enforceable
somewhere.
so
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for
breach.
the
only
question
is
whether
that
cause
of
action
sounds
in
state
law
or
instead
in
federal
law.
and
on
that
question,
when
congress
prescribes,
as
it
did
in
the
preemption
provision,
that
the
rights
and
duties
are
matters
of
federal
law,
it
seems
most
likely
that
congress
intended
there
would
be
a
federal
cause
of
action
that
could
be
brought
in
federal
court
to
litigate
those
terms.
and
that's
what
congress
did
in
the
terms
of
the
preemption
provision.
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
this
is
part
and
parcel
of
benefits,
justice
ginsburg,
because
you're
right
that
when...
and
when
an
employee
asks
for
benefits,
you'd
expect
that
issue
to
be
litigated
in
federal
court.
but
this
is
a
condition
on
benefits.
that's
how
the
reimbursement
obligation
is
framed
in
the
contract.
it's
that
if
you
get
benefits
from
the
federal
government
and
then
later
on
get
the
same
benefits
from
a
third
party,
a
condition
on
the
government
benefits
is
at
that
point
you
have
to
reimburse
the
federal
treasury.
so
i
don't
think
one
can
easily
draw
a
distinction
between
benefits
qua
benefits
and
benefits
that
are
at...
at
one
point
issued
to
the
employee
but
then
are
subsequently
returned
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
reimbursement
obligation.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
do
you
mean
in
an
underlying
tort
action
or--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
in
the
underlying
tort
action,
that
generally
would
be
governed
by
state
law.
now,
on
the
question
of
whether
a
benefit
is
something
that
the
individual
is
entitled
to
or,
conversely,
whether
the
benefit
is
obligated
to...
whether
the
individual
is
obligated
to--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
not
sure--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i...
i
think
that...
that
when
it's
a
claim
for
benefits,
it
probably
would
be
governed
by
federal
law.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
but
even--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
it
depends
on
whether
the
contract
speaks
to
the
issue.
now,
insofar
as
the
contract--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--insofar--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--insofar
as
the
contract
doesn't
speak
to
an
issue,
there
obviously
would
be
a
stronger
argument
for
the
operation
of
state
law.
but
that's
not--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--not
necessarily.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it...
it
differs
from
erisa
in
the
following
sense,
that
in
erisa,
erisa
sets
forth
a
cause
of
action.
and
so
the
court
has
concluded
that
that
cause
of
action
is
exclusive
of
state
court
causes
of
action.
and
we're
not
taking
that
position
here.
we...
we
don't
say
that
the
federal
action
is
the
only
action...
excuse
me...
that's
available.
state
court
actions
for
breach
of
contract
might
also
be
available.
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
going
to
be
a...
a
terribly
difficult
inquiry
because
of
the
precision
with
which
the
terms
of
the
preemption
provision
speaks.
and
it's
certainly
not
difficult
with
respect
to
the
reimbursement
obligation
because
it
fits--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
has,
but
in
terms
of...
in
terms
of
the
relate
to
requirement,
that's
true,
and
i
think
the
court
would
apply
exactly
the
same
standards
that
it
applies
in
erisa.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't.
i
think--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
boyle
somewhat
stands
for
the
same
proposition
in
this--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
boyle
at
least
establishes
that
the
terms
of
a
contract
preempted
state
law
because
it
was
a
procurement
contract
and
the
idea
was
that
by
complying
with
the
terms
of
the
procurement
contract,
the
contractor
asserted
essentially
a
federally
compelled
defense
to
the
state
court
action.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
know
that
there
are
other
statutes,
but
what
this
particular...
particular
provision
indicates
is
that
congress
thought
it
was
very
important
that
fehba
contracts
would
control
over
state
law,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
constitutional
limitation
on
congress'
ability
to
do
that.
after
all--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that...
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--absolutely
that's
constitutional,
and
that's...
that's
what
i
mean
to
be
saying
because
it's
federal
law--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
they're
not.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
on
which
particular--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there's...
there's
variation,
sure.
now,
on...
on--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
there's...
it
depends
on
what
you're
talking
about.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
statute
doesn't
give
a
great
deal
of
specific--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--direction
on
the
terminology.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
gives
some,
but
it's
only
bare
bones,
justice
breyer.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
but
i
think
that's
important
because
what...
what
congress
has
done
is
essentially
to
leave
it
to
opm
to
negotiate
the
terms
of
these
contracts.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
those--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
contracts
between
the
individual
and
the
carrier
are
dictated
by
opm
in
some
sense
because
opm
negotiates
the
terms
that
bind
the
individual.
the
contract
that
you
and
i
enter
into
when
we
sign
on
for
health
insurance
is
a
part
of
the...
of
the
program,
if
you
will,
that's
negotiated
by
opm
with
the
carrier.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right
in
negotiating
with
the
carrier,
and
a
statement
of
benefits
is
essentially
the
program.
it
tells
you
what
benefits
you're
entitled
to
and
it
tells
you
what
obligations
you're
encumbered
by
when
you
take
on
those
benefits.
and
one
of
the
obligations
that
you're
encumbered
by
under
the
clear
terms
of
this
contract
is
the
obligation
to
reimburse
the
carrier
in
the
event--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that
you
receive
benefits
and
then
subsequently
receive
benefits
from
a
third
party.
and
one
thing
that
i
don't
want
to
lose
sight
of
is
that
ultimately
this
concerns
money
that
will
be
reimbursed
to
the
federal
treasury.
and
so
the
fact
that
this
case
happens
to
involve
litigation
between
two
private
parties
shouldn't
obscure
the
strength
of
the
government's
interest
in
the
area,
given
that
federal
funds
are
involved.
