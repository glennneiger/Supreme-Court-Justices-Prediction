justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying
that
there
is
a
uniformity
between
a
master
contract
between
the
united
states
and
blue
cross
on
the
one
hand,
and
blue
cross
and
the
subscriber
on
the
other
hand.
but
doesn't
the
united
states
approve
the
latter
contract?
in
other
words,
doesn't
it...
well,
i
forget
the
initials...
opm
or
whatever
it
is.
doesn't
it
have
a...
a
requirement
of
approval
going
to
the
terms
of
the
contract
between
empire
and...
and
the
employee
before
that
contract
goes
into
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that...
isn't
that
crucial,
though,
in
your
answer
to
justice
breyer?
because
if
the
united
states...
if
opm
approves
the
empire
employee
contract,
maybe
you
can
say,
well,
gee,
there's
something
strange
going
on
at
opm
if
they
don't
require
exactly
the
same
terms
in
the
contract
with
the
employee
that
they...
that
they
require
in
their
master
contract
with...
with
empire.
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
having
uniformity
in
which
the...
in
the...
in
the
interpretation
and
application
of
contracts,
which
they
do
approve,
between
empire,
other
blue
cross
blue
shield
entities,
and
their
employees.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
united
states
is
treated
the
same
in
relation
to
all
federal
employees.
i
mean,
there's...
there's
an
interest
in
uniformity
for
fairness
among
employees,
and
there's
an
interest
in
the
united
states
in
having
the
same
expectation,
in
this
case
a
reimbursement
expectation,
no
matter
where
the
employee
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
your...
your
answer
to...
to
justice
scalia...
i'm
sorry...
just
did
not
register.
i
don't
understand--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
do
they
take
money
in
new
york
that
you
haven't
gotten
from
the
other
side?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't...
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
that...
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
money,
every
penny
collected,
minus
any
service
fee,
is
going
to
go
into
the
federal
treasury.
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
whether
it's
collected
or
not
may...
indeed,
may
vary
depending
on
whether
state
law
or
federal
law
applies.
and
if
federal
law
applies,
then
you
have
the
jurisdictional
consequence.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
presumably
it
didn't
do
that
because
the
preemption
provision
does
not
rely
upon
conflict.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
doesn't
apply
to
reimbursement
provisions,
you
say,
but
it
does
apply
to
benefits.
and...
and
the
value
of
a
benefit
is
going
to
vary
from
the...
the
policy
limit
to
zero
depending,
in
a
case
like
this,
on
whether
a
third
party
payment
has
to
be
given
to
the
government
with...
with...
isn't...
isn't
that
a
question
of
benefit?
justice
david
h.
souter
will
you
quote
the
language
that
you're
referring
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
don't
want
to
take
up
too--
justice
david
h.
souter
--my...
my
concern
simply
is
that
you've
made
a
conclusory
statement
that
elsewhere
there's
a
definition
that
doesn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and...
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--after
the
argument,
just
give
me
a
cite
so
i
know
exactly
what
you're...
you're
getting
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr....
mr.
stock,
we
have
one
loose
end.
i
think
we
do.
both
justice
breyer
and
i
have...
have
asked
the
question
whether
opm
has
to
approve
of
the
terms
of
the
contract
between
blue
cross
and...
and
the...
the
insured.
is...
does
opm
have
to
approve?
justice
david
h.
souter
assuming
the
consistency
term,
that
supports
an
argument
that
the
government
has
an
interest
in...
in
uniformity
of...
of
interpretation,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if...
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if,
in
fact,
there
were
consistently
only
in
this
remote
sense
so
that
the
interests
which
are
meant
to
be
protected
in
the...
in
the
opm
blue
cross
contract
aren't
being
protected
at
the
next
level,
then
opm
could
bring
an
action
against...
against
blue
cross
saying
it's
not
consistent
enough,
couldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
