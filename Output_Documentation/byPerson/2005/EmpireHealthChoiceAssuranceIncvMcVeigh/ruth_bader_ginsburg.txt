justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
go
back
and
because
the...
the
parties
seem
to
have
different
views
about
it?
i
think
you
said
it
was
required
by
opm
to
have
this
reimbursement
term,
and
the
other
side
said
that
there
was
no
requirement
from
the
government
agency
that
you
include
the
reimbursement
term.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that...
all
that
says
is
that
opm
looked
at
these
terms
and
it
thought
they
were
okay.
it's
not...
it
doesn't
show
that
opm
required
these...
this
as
a
condition
for
empire
to
serve
as
the
insurer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
speaks
about
a
federal
forum.
and
if
you
look
at
this
entire
picture,
you're
seeking
reimbursement,
and
you're
seeking
reimbursement
based
on
a
tort
recovery.
and
why
wouldn't
the
most
sensible,
the
most
natural
thing
for
a
legislature,
if
they
thought
about
it,
be
to
say,
well,
that
claim
for
reimbursement
ought
to
come
in
on
the
coattails
of
the
tort
claim?
you
don't
need
to
make
a
whole
separate
federal
case
out...
out
of
it.
why
would
congress
want
these
claims
to
be
subject
to
a
separate
federal
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
because
there's
an
anterior
lawsuit
and
everything
rides
on
that
state
court
suit.
there
wouldn't
be
any
recovery
from
which
you
could
claim
reimbursement
were
it
not
for
that
state
court
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
have
any
such
problem
here.
there's
no
conflict
between
the
new
york
law...
you
certainly
could
have
gone
into
that
lawsuit
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
could
see
if
this
were...
what
we
were
talking
about
everything
is...
the
insurance
of
a
federal
employee
and
questions
about
coverage,
questions
about
benefits,
all
of
that
between
the
employee
and
the
carrier.
but
this
comes
up
because
we
have
a
third
party
who
enters
the
picture
in
an
estate
law
claim.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
just
say,
well,
everything
is...
this
whole
thing
is...
is
all
a
federal
contract.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the...
the
purpose
of
the
preemption
provision
in
this
statute
was
related
to
benefits
and
coverage.
some
states
have
mandatory
coverage
for
this
or
that.
the
case
that
was
mentioned
is
the
chiropractor.
and
the...
in
the
federal
scheme,
the
federal
administrator
didn't
want
to
be
saddled
with
whatever
the
particular
packages
that
the
states
had.
so
the
coverage
and
the
benefits...
those
were
to
be
determined
on
the
federal
level,
and
you
weren't
supposed
to
be
saddled
with
whatever
the
state
thought
would
be
good
to
have
in
the
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
you...
you
might
follow
along
with
that
perfectly
well
if
you're
talking
about
the
beneficiary,
the
federal
employee,
saying
i'm
entitled
to
a
certain
coverage
or
i'm
entitled
to
certain
benefits.
you
would
expect
that
suit
to
be
in
federal
court.
but
why
would
you
expect
what
piece
of
the
tort
recovery
the
carrier
will
get
to
be
in
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
do
you
answer
the
question
that
i
think
justice
breyer
was...
was
getting
at,
that
it's...
it's
a...
the...
what's
in
it
for
the
carrier?
nothing.
as...
if...
if
every
penny
that
the
carrier
collects
is
going
to
go
into
the
u.s.
treasury,
then
why
does
the
carrier
care?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
empire
healthchoice
assurance
v.
mcveigh,
no.
05-200.
the
federal
employee
health
benefits
act
of
1959,
which
i
will
refer
to
as
fehba,
as
its
name
conveys,
establishes
a
health-insurance
program
for
federal
employees.
the
act
authorizes
the
office
of
personal
management,
opm,
to
contract
with
private
carriers
to
offer
federal
employees
an
array
of
healthcare
plans.
the
most
heavily
enrolled
plan
for
which
opm
has
contracted
is
the
blue
cross
blue
shield
service
benefit
plan,
administered
by
local
blue
cross
blue
shield
companies.
this
case
concerns
the
proper
forum
for
reimbursement
claims,
claims
that
arise
when
a
planned
beneficiary
injured
in
an
accident
whose
medical
bills
have
been
paid
by
the
carrier
recovers
damages
unaided
by
the
carrier
in
a
state-court
tort
action
against
a
third
party
alleged
to
have
caused
the
accident.
fehba
contains
a
preemption
clause
under
which
terms
of
healthcare
plans
displace
state
law
on
issues
relating
to
coverage
or
benefits.
the
act
contains
no
provision
on
the
subrogation
or
reimbursement
rights
of
carrier.
annually
renewed
contracts
between
opm
and
the
blue
cross
blue
shield
association,
however,
have
obligated
the
carrier
to
make
a
reasonable
effort
to
recoup
amounts
paid
for
medical
care.
the
instant
case
originated
when
the
administrator
of
a
plan
beneficiary’s
estate
pursued
tort
litigation
in
state
court
against
parties
alleged
to
have
caused
the
beneficiary’s
injuries.
the
carrier
had
notice
of
the
state-court
action,
but
took
no
part
in
it.
when
the
tort
action
terminated
in
a
settlement,
the
carrier
filed
suit
against
the
insured
worker
in
federal
court,
seeking
reimbursement
of
the
full
amount
the
carrier
had
paid
for
the
worker’s
medical
care.
the
question
presented:
does
28
u.s.c.
§1331
authorizing
jurisdiction
over
civil
actions
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
state
encompass
the
carrier’s
action.
in
accord
with
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit,
we
hold
that
§1331
does
not
cover
the
carrier’s
suit
for
reimbursement.
fehba
itself
provides
for
federal-court
jurisdiction
only
when
a
planned
beneficiary
disputes
the
denial
of
coverage
or
benefits.
even
though
the
act
makes
no
express
provision
for
federal-court
jurisdiction
over
reimbursement
suits
brought
by
carriers
against
planned
beneficiaries,
the
carrier
here
urges
that
its
suit
belongs
in
federal
court;
that
is,
so
the
carrier
maintains,
because
the
entire
scheme
is
pervasively
federal.
the
master
contract
with
blue
cross
is
negotiated
with
a
government
agency,
opm,
benefits
are
paid
from
a
fund
maintained
in
the
u.s.
treasury,
and
reimbursements
are
returned
to
that
fund.
on
the
other
hand,
the
personal-injury
suit
that
generated
the
settlement
out
of
which
the
carrier
seeks
reimbursement
has
no
federal
element
to
it.
suits
of
that
character
are
governed
by
state
law.
the
carrier
here
is
essentially
seeking
a
portion
of
the
recovery
gained
in
the
state-court
litigation,
and
such
wrap-up
claims
are
normally
pursued
in
the
court
in
which
the
personal-injury
action
is
launched.
a
carrier’s
commencement
of
a
separate
federal
case
to
reach
the
proceeds
of
the
settlement
can
be
costly
for
the
injured
worker,
and
we
are
reluctant
to
attribute
to
congress
a
purpose
unexpressed
in
fehba’s
text
to
place
such
suits
in
federal
court.
we
do
not
read
fehba’s
preemption
clause
to
open
the
federal-court
door
to
a
carrier’s
reimbursement
claim.
for
one
thing,
that
clause
has
a
peculiar
feature:
it
makes
contract
terms
in
the
blue
cross
plan
preempted.
ordinarily,
federal
preemption
provisions
make
federal
laws,
not
termed
in
a
contract
with
a
private
carrier,
preemptive.
that
unusual
feature
inclines
us
to
read
the
clause
modestly.
congress
no
doubt
could
expressly
provide
that
reimbursement
claims
of
the
kind
here
involved
warrant
the
exercise
of
federal-court
jurisdiction;
but
for
reasons
spelled
out
at
length
in
the
court’s
opinion,
we
conclude
that
the
presentations
made
in
this
case
fall
short
of
demonstrating
that
a
federal
forum
is
available
to
the
carrier
here.
federal
courts
should
await
a
clear
signal
from
congress
before
treating
a
carrier’s
suit
for
a
share
in
a
worker’s
personal-injury
judgment
or
settlement
as
a
case
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit;
the
chief
justice
and
justices
stevens,
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined
this
opinion;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
joined
by
justices
kennedy,
souter
and
alito.
