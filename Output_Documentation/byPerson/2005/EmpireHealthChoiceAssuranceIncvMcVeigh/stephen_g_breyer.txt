justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
significant
variation
among
the
different
carriers
as
to
the
terms
of
the
contracts
they
use
in
different
places
for
federal
employees?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
this
program.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
lot
or
a
little?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
a
statute.
the
statute
has
fairly
close
detail
as
to
what
the
contracts
must
contain.
it
gives
authority
to
omb
or...
to
write
regs.
and
they
have
written
regs
that
have
very
detailed
provisions
as
to
what
the
contracts
must
contain,
and
then
there
is
the
contract
with
the
individual
carried...
when
the...
when
the
carrier
is
implementing
these
rules,
regulations,
and
statutes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
gives
some.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
gives
some.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
know,
but
i'm
trying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--insofar
as
the
individual
carriers
write
contracts
with
their
covered
employees,
i.e.,
me
and
you
and
other
people,
and
there's
a
lot
of
variation,
i
would
say
there's
a
lot
of
private
going
on.
but
insofar
as
those
contracts
are
dictated
by
what
opm
says,
then
it
looks
more
to
me
like
a
regular
federal
program.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
trying
to
get
a
handle
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
when
i
sign
a
contract,
or
anyone
who's
a
federal
employee,
it's
opm
who
effectively
sets
those
terms?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
quite
possible
no
one
in
congress
thought
about
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
common.
so
if
it
is
common,
why
is
it
that
we
would
not
use
the
same
approach
that
the
court
used
in
clearfield
trust,
in
kimbell
foods,
and
really
look
to
the
nature
of
the
contract?
whereas
here,
the
rights
at
stake
are
really
those
of
the
united
states
in
that
they
are
going
to
get
the
money.
we
have
a
statute.
we
have
all
those
things
i
just
listed.
it
covers
only
federal
employees.
should...
there
are
strong
interests
in
uniformity
throughout
the
nation,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
so
what
is
the
difference
between
this
case,
other
than
a
technical
difference?
i
concede
that
one.
the
title
is
not
united
states.
it's
blue
cross
blue
shield
or
whatever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
empire,
et
cetera.
but
aside
from
that,
why
is
it
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
obvious
reason
for
uniformity
would
be
you
are
a
federal
employee,
whether
you're
in
alaska
or
whether
you're
in
virginia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
unreasonable
to
think
congress
would
want
the
rights
of
those
different
federal
employees
to
differ
just
because
of
where
they
live.
and
so
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
curious--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i...
i
wasn't
thinking
of
that
kind
of
uniformity.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
thinking
of
the
contract...
the
contracts
that
the
carriers
enter
into
with
the
individual
federal
employees
in
different
places.
and
i'm
trying
to
get
an
idea
of
whether
those
contracts
all
read
the
same
or
they
don't.
and
so
far,
you
have
found
one
example
of
where
they
read
differently.
some
contracts
apparently
say
when
you
reimburse
us,
you
can
subtract
attorney's
fees,
and
others
say
when
you
reimburse
us
maybe
you
can
subtract
attorney's
fees,
depending
on
how
we
feel
about
it.
and
i
grant
you
that
is
a
difference.
and
i
am
curious,
as
was
justice
souter,
as
to
whether
you
have
to
get
opm
approval
for
that
difference
or
whether
opm
can
tell
you,
knock
it
off,
we
want
the
same.
and
also
i'd
like
other
examples.
what
i'm
trying
to
do,
to
be
clear
about
it,
is
i'm
trying
to
see
how
similar
this
is
to
the
instance
of
the
federal
employee
checks,
which
this
court
many,
many
years
ago
said,
when
you
pay
your
federal
employees
and
you
write
a
check,
it's
federal
law
that's
going
to
govern
the
interpretation
of
the
endorsement.
i
want
to
see
how
similar
it
is
and
how
different.
i
have
two
differences.
one
is
the
name
on
this
case
is
empire,
not
united
states,
and
the
second
difference
is
the
one
you
just
mentioned
about
may
rather
than
must.
now,
are
there
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
would
have
thought
the
issue
is
whether
federal
law
governs
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
they
come
to
federal
court.
so
what
is
clearly...
maybe
i...
maybe
you've...
i
don't
think
you've
said
this.
we
know
this.
if
the
united
states
issues
checks
to
all
of
its
employees
throughout
the
country
and
then
it
seeks
to
recover
from
one
of
the
drawees
or
one
of
the
people
who
endorsed
the
check
on
the
ground
it
was
fraudulent,
we
know
that
it
is
federal
law
that
must
govern
those
checks.
right?
from
clearfield.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
is
the
difference
in
this
case?
in
this
case,
we
have
a
private
administrator
of
this
federal...
of
this...
of
this
federal
program.
there
are
federal
employees
throughout
the
country.
they
are
supposed
to
receive
uniform...
reasonably
uniform
health
insurance,
and
the
private
administrator
wants
to
obtain
money
that
it
thinks
it's
entitled
to
to
put
into
the
federal
treasury.
now,
aside
from
the
name,
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
that's...
that's
what
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
in
my
mind
how
close
this
is
to
the
federal
government
running
a
uniform
program.
i
mean,
everybody
agrees
federal
law
governs
questions
involving
the
rights
of
the
united
states--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--arising
under
nationwide
federal
programs.
and
here,
we
have
not
the
united
states.
we
have
empire.
and
so
how
close
is
empire
to
being
simply
an
instrument
of
the
united
states
in
this
respect,
and
how
close
is
it
to
being
really
an
independent
company
that
sets
up
its
own
insurance
contracts?
that's
what
i'm
trying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
quite
good.
what
are
you
reading
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
you
reading
from
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
everybody
in
the
entire
united
states
gets
the
same
piece
of
paper.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
identical.
there
is
no
difference
between
every
individual's
contract,
every
federal
employee's...
i
guess
it's
a
contract
with
the
federal
employee.
isn't
it?
i
mean,
he's
bound
by
it
you
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
i
am...
in
alaska,
virginia,
everywhere,
they
get
the
same
piece
of
paper.
they
enroll
and
then
they're
bound
by
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
question
here
is
whether
that
should
get
different
interpretations
possibly
in
different
places.
