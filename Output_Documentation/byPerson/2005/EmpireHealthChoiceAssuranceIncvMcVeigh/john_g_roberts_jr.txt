chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
05-200,
empire
healthchoice
assurance
v.
mcveigh.
mr.
shelley.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
this
is
a
fairly
indirect
way
of
establishing
a
federal
cause
of
action.
i
mean,
it...
it's
a
preemption
provision.
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
congress
thought
there
was
no
need
for
a
federal
cause
of
action?
because
it's
a
contract
action.
state
courts
handle
those
every
day,
and
they
assumed
they'd
be
handled
by
a
state
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
noticed
you
referred
in
your
brief
to
the
jackson
transit
line
of
authority.
do
you
know
how
many
times
jackson
transit
has
been
cited
in
the
last
20
years
by
this
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
been
cited.
i
think
it's
never
been
applied
and
it's
not
been
cited
once
in
20
years.
so
what's
the
line
of
authority?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
not
talking
about
the
contract
between
you
and
the
federal
government.
we're
talking
about
some
other
agreement
between
you
and
an
individual
employee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
may
give
rise
to
a
separate
agreement,
a
related
agreement,
if
you
will,
between
you
and
the
employee.
but
it's
not...
it's
not
a...
you're
not
the
government.
the
employee
is
not
the
government,
at
least
not
for
these
purposes.
so
why
is
it
a
government
contract?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
government
says...
congress
says,
we
think
opm
should
have
a
recreation
center
for
its
employees
and
it
should
have
all
these
things,
and
then
opm
enters
into
a
contract
with
a
company
that
runs
recreation
centers...
okay...
that's
a
contract
with
the
government.
and
then
that
entity
enters
into
a
contract
with
somebody
else
to
supply
the
basketball
hoops.
would
you
say
that
that
last
contract
is
a
government
contract?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
the
provision...
even
if
at
some
point
congress
said,
and
besides,
you
know,
the
basketball
hoops
should
be...
you
know,
made
in
america
as
opposed
to
somewhere
else
and,
you
know,
specifies
the
terms
of
the
subcontract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you...
following
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
question,
could
you
intervene
asserting
rights
of
subrogation
in
the
underlying
tort
suit
that
your
covered
beneficiary
brought
in
state
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
it
be
more
efficient
for
you
to
intervene
in
the
pending
state
suit
and
get
it
all
resolved
at
once
rather
than
waiting
until
your
beneficiary
gets
a
recovery
and
then
starting
a
whole
other
federal
suit
over
this
somewhat
subsidiary
subrogation
point?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
at
that
point,
you'd
be
able
to
assert
your
argument
under
the
federal
preemption
provision
that
says,
in
my
view
somewhat
surprisingly,
that
these
contract
terms
preempt
state
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
have
been
a
good
time
for
them
to
say
we
want
a
federal...
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
these
causes
of
actions
if
that's
what
they
had
in
mind,
but
they
didn't
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
there
sure
was.
for
those
who
like
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
the
house
report
said
that...
again,
it's
very
curious
language.
it
said,
this
change
will
help
strengthen
the
case
in
favor
of
federal
jurisdiction,
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
since
when
is
congress
trying
to
strengthen...
they
either
decide
it's
going
to
be
federal
jurisdiction
or
not.
they
don't
try
to
make
arguments.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
there
any
comparable
situation
where
a
contract
between
two
private
parties
has
the
effect
of
preempting
state
law?
suppose
all
you
have
to
do
in
our
service
benefit
plan
is
agree
with
your
beneficiaries
that
in
the
case
of
subrogation,
you're
entitled
to,
you
know,
10
times
actual
damages,
if
they
don't
pay
up
right
away
or
something
like
that.
and...
and
that
would
override
all
sorts
of
state
law.
you
could
specify
you're
entitled
to
interest
at
20
percent
and
that
would
preempt
state
usury
laws?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
there...
isn't
that
a
big
leap?
i
mean,
even
if
we
agree
with
you
that
there
are
federal
rights
and
duties,
is
it
irrational
for
congress
to
determine,
since
they
arise
in
a
normal
breach
of
contract
action,
we're
going
to
assume
they're
going
to
be
brought
in
state
court?
the
cause
of
action
is
for
breach
contract
that
every
state
recognizes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
wouldn't
it
have
been
the
easiest
thing
for
congress
to
say,
as
it
does
countless
times
when
it
creates
federal
rights,
that
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
enforce
these
rights?
and
they
didn't
do
that
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
erisa
has
a
very
clear
preemption
provision
too,
and
that's
generated
a
fair
amount
of
work
for
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
srinivasan.
mr.
stock.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
suppose
that
the
preemption
provision
would
apply
equally
if
this
were
brought
in
state
court
or
federal
court.
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but...
but
the
preemption
provision,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
empire,
would
ensure
uniformity.
in
other
words,
if
the
contract
terms
preempt
state
law,
then
any
impediment
to
recovery
by
empire
that
varies
from
state
to
state
would
be
overridden.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
understand
that.
but
to
the
extent
people
are
concerned
about
disuniformity
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
federal
recovery,
the
preemption
provision
is
going
to
apply
whether
this
action
is
in
state
court
or
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
only
question
that
we're
considering
today
is
whether
or
not
federal
question
jurisdiction
exists
to
authorize
bringing
this
suit
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they've
already
said
that.
i
mean,
there
would
be
federal
jurisdiction
there
because
the
federal
government
would
be
a
party
to
the
case.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
stock.
mr.
shelley,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
wonder
if
you
could
focus
on
one
question
for
me.
if
you
have
a
state
law
cause
of
action
and
the
law
to
be
applied
to
some
aspects
of
that
cause
of
action
is
federal
law,
is
that
sufficient
to
establish
federal
question
jurisdiction
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the...
the
grable
case
said,
though,
that
the
federal
question
had
to
be
a
necessary
element
of
the
state
law
cause
of
action.
that's
not
always
the
case
in
these
cases,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
only...
the...
the
federal
question
comes
up
only
on
issues
of
preemption.
they
may
or
may
not
be
presented
in
a
particular
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
kind
of...
that
begs
the...
that's
not
the
question
i
asked
and
it
sort
of
begs
the
question.
i
mean,
you
have
the
state
law
cause
of
action
to
enforce
your
contract
claim,
and
if
there's
some
state
law
that's
asserted
against
you
that's
inconsistent
with
the
contract,
then
you
have
the
federal
question
issue.
but
that's
the
only
federal
question
i
see
in
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
hypothetical
that
i
started
with
was
assuming
you
have
a
state
law
claim,
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
so
do
you
have
any
authority
other
than
grable
for
the
proposition
that
a
state
law
cause
of
action
which...
in
which
the
law
to
apply
may
or
may
not
turn
on
federal
law
in
particular
aspects
presents
a
federal
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
shelley.
the
case
is
submitted.
