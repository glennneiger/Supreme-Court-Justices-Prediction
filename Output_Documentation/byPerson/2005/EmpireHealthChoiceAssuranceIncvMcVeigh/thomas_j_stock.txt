mr.
thomas
j.
stock
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
i
must
confess
that
i
continue
to
be
perplexed
by
the
claim
that
congress
intended
reimbursement
claims
of
this
type
to
be
handled
and...
and
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
federal
courts
when
that
same
congress,
in
enacting
the
fehba
statute,
did
not
provide
for
that
cause
of
action
or
that
right
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
it...
it--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--no.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
because,
your
honor,
in
the
first
instance,
number
one,
uniformity
really
is
not
a...
a
legitimate
claim
in
this...
in
this
instance
by
blue
cross
and
blue
shield.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
because--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
it...
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
the
way
blue
cross
has
written
this
reimbursement
provision,
they
will
differ.
the
reimbursement
provision,
which...
by
the
way,
to
start
with,
the
reimbursement
provision
that
is
in
the
blue
cross
blue...
blue
cross
blue
shield
contract
with
the
employees
is
different
than
the
reimbursement
provisions
which
are
described
in
the
contract
between
opm
and
blue
cross
blue
shield.
it
is
markedly
different
in
several
ways,
the
first
way
being
that,
with
respect
to
procurement
costs
and
the
issue
of
this
$157,000,
who
pays
to
obtain
that.
in
the
opm
blue
cross
blue
shield
contract,
it
provides
for
attorney's
fees
and
disbursements
to
be
paid
by
the
government
and
the...
and
the
claim...
the
reimbursement
claim
could
be
reduced
by
that.
in
the
blue
cross
blue
shield
version
of
that
between
blue
cross
blue
shield
and
the...
the
litigant
here,
that
provision
is
changed.
and
this
is
why
i
say
they
then
undercut
their
own
claim
for
uniformity.
they
basically
say
that
we'll
allow
you
attorney's
fees
if
we
feel
like
it
in
a
particular
case.
that's
not
a
uniformity
provision.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
i'm
not
sure
what
the
mechanics
are
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
well,
i
think
when
we're
talking
about
uniformity,
your
honor,
because
this
is
a
statute
designed
to
benefit
federal
employees,
that
we're
talking
about
uniformity
in
the
context
of
all
federal
employees
are
treated
the
same.
the
provision
that
blue
cross
blue--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--that's
correct.
but
in...
in
terms
of
uniformity,
the
provision
that
blue
cross...
several
provisions
that
blue
cross
blue
shield
has
added
to
this
reimbursement
clause
undercut
the
uniformity
aspect
of
it.
and
when
you
say
in
a
particular
case,
we'll
decide,
well,
the
fellow
from
alaska...
we'll
give
him
his
attorney's
fees
and
disbursements,
but
the
fellow
from
new
york,
we
won't
give
it
to,
you
undercut
any...
any--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--the...
the
uniformity
which
we're
seeking,
relative
to
these
benefits,
and
the...
and
the
argument
as
to
uniformity
i
would
submit
to
you,
at
least
as
to
how
we
treat
the
federal
employees,
is
illusory
in
this
case
because
no
matter
how
this
court
decides
in
this
particular
case,
whether
there's
federal
jurisdiction
here
or
not,
the
employees
are
being
treated
differently
state
to
state
based
upon
the
provision
that
blue
cross
blue
shield
has
enacted.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
well,
it
was
incomplete,
your
honor,
because
i...
i
had
turned
around
to
answer
the
chief
justice.
the...
the
way
they
have
this
set
up
with
the
right
of
reimbursement
and
the...
and
the
kickers
that
blue
cross
blue
shield
puts
in
the
statement
of
benefits
creates
a
situation.
they...
they
add
that
these
rights
of
reimbursement
apply
no
matter
how
the
cause
of
action
for
damages
is
delineated,
in
other
words,
whether
it's
seeking
damages
for
medical
benefits
or
damages
for
pain
and
suffering.
and
what
blue
cross
blue
shield
has
introduced
is
that...
that
kicker.
and...
and
what
that
does,
in
effect,
from
state
to
state
is
change
the
outcome
for
the
employee
because,
for
instance,
in
new
york
where
we
have
a
collateral
source
rule
by
statute
that
says,
you
may
not
prove
medical
damages
in
a
personal
injury
case
for
which
you've
collected
insurance.
so,
for
instance,
in
denise
mcveigh's
case,
i
can't
prove
her
medical
bills.
yet,
blue
cross
blue
shield
is
going
to
come
in
and
pick
denise
finn's
pocket
on
her
claim
for
pain
and
suffering
for
the
$157,000
in
medical
bills
that
they
say
they've
paid.
whereas,
if
i
go
across
the
river...
and
i
don't
know
the
law
in
new
jersey,
but
assuming
that
new
jersey
uses
the
older
rule
where,
if
i
had
the
good
sense
to
buy
myself
medical
insurance
and
i
collected
medical
insurance
for
the
benefits
that
were...
if
i
collect
the
medical
payments
for
the
medical
bills,
i
can
still
go
into
court
and
prove
those
medical
bills
as
against
the
tortfeasor.
in
that
particular
instance,
blue
cross
blue
shield
comes
in
and
it
takes
money
at
least
that
i've
gotten
from
the
other
side
as
opposed
to
in
new
york
where
they
take
money
that
i
haven't
gotten
from
the
other
side.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
absolutely.
they're
looking
to
assert
a
claim.
i
don't
have
a
claim
for
medical
benefits
in
the
underlying
court--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
i
have
to
concede
that
that's
true,
and
if
that
is
the
uniformity
that
we
seek
and
the
only--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--i'm
sure
they
do.
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
i
assure
you,
your
honor,
that
denise
finn
doesn't.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
there
are
differences
in
my
understanding,
your
honor,
from
state
to
state
between
the
different
blue
cross
entities.
i
couldn't
tell
you
what
exactly
those
differences
are,
but
my
understanding
is
that
these
blue
cross
policies
vary
from
state
to
state.
do
they
vary...
i...
i
think,
your
honor,
although
it
supports
my
contention,
that
you
may
have
misunderstood
what
i
said
about
the...
the
difference
between
the
reimbursement
clauses,
honestly.
what
i...
what
i
indicated
was
the...
the
reimbursement
clause
that
is
in
the
opm/blue
cross
contract
is
different
from
what
blue
cross
then
enters
into
with
its
members.
that
differs.
i
was
not
asserting
that
it
differs
from
state
to
state.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
effect
of
that
differs
from
state
to
state
certainly.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
it
does--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--it...
it
would
be
in
error,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
the...
at
the...
at
the
very
essence
of
that,
i
don't
believe
that
a
contract
can
preempt
state
law.
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states
can
preempt
state
law.
if
somehow
you
can
bootstrap
a
contract
into
that
by
some
theory,
i
suppose
you
could
argue
that
it...
that
it--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--it...
it
would
not,
your
honor,
in
this
instance
because
the...
the
operation
of
that
statute
does
not
affect
their
right
to
reimbursement
under
their
contract
provision.
it
affects
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
would
ever--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--the...
the
situation
with
the...
the
term
of
new
york
law
that
i
am...
that
i
had
indicated
would
occur
during
a
trial
of
the
case
and
in
terms
of
my
cause
of
action.
it
would
not
affect
blue
cross'
lawsuit
against
my
client.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
yes,
they
wouldn't
be
a
party
to
that
suit
at
that
time,
though,
your
honor,
in...
in
terms
of
raising
that
issue.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
right,
but
that
wouldn't
affect...
that
wouldn't
override
the
net...
the
net
effect
on
the...
on
the
person.
the...
the
real
world
effect
on
denise
finn
and
other
people
like
her
would
still
be
different.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
and
if
the
only...
if
the
only
interest
in
uniformity
we
have,
again,
is
whether
the...
whether
the
federal
government
gets
its...
its
money
back,
then...
you
know,
then
the
uniformity
argument
may
fly.
but
if
we're
also
interested
in
the...
in
the
uniformity
argument
in
the
manner
in
which
federal
employees
are
treated
and
in
the
manner
in
which
ladies
who...
such
as
denise
finn
are
treated,
then
uniformity
is...
is
out
the
window
under
these...
under
this--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--and
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
it
clearly
does
not
because
this
case,
involving
blue
cross
suing
denise
finn
for
these
benefits
involves
not
issues
of
the
construction
or
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute,
but
issue...
the
issues
involved
in
our
case
are
whether
they're
entitled
to
collect
the
money
that
they
paid
three
times
to
the
same
doctor
for
the
same
service
on
the
same
day.
they
paid
a
particular
dr.
brown
$17,500
for
the
same
service
on
three
occasions.
in
addition,
our
dispute
involves
whether
or
not
some
of
the
benefits
that
they
claim
they
paid
and
which
were
medically
a
result
of
this
accident
were
in
fact
or
whether
they
were
taking
other
benefits
they
paid
and
trying
to
be
a
little
cute
and
collect
those
under
saxony.
those
are
the
issues.
those
issues--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--well,
yes,
but--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--yes,
your
honor,
which--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--the
difference
is,
is
in
the
instance
of
clearfield
trust,
you
had
the
government
involved
in
a
dispute
over
their
own
commercial
paper
that
they
issued
and
a
uniquely
federal
interest
and
a
uniquely
federal
item.
here,
these...
federal
employees
aren't
the
only
employees
in
america
who
get
health
benefits,
and
they
are...
these
disputes
that
arise
under
this
statute
are
most
frequently
not
of
the...
not
seeking
to
answer
the
grand
questions.
they're
most
frequently
involved
in
dealing
with
issues
such
as
we
have
here.
whether
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
missed
the
first--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--i
don't
know
that
i
would,
but
i
think
the
caveat
to
that
is
if
the
federal
government
were
running
it
themselves,
pursuant
to
a
different
statute
than
we
have
here,
the
first
thing
i
think
i
would
look
at
is
what
jurisdiction
or
what
the
congress
had
to
say
about
where
they
wanted
cases
arising
from
that.
it
may
well
be--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--yes,
your
honor.
but
they're
not
a
party
to
this
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
interestingly
enough,
the
government
has
told
us
that.
and
what
they
told
us...
and
it's
at
page
4
of...
and
in
a
footnote
number
3
from
the
amicus
curiae's
briefs
from
cruz.
and
the
government
has
told
us
in
cruz's
pending
certiorari
petition
that
that...
blue
cross
blue
shield
carriers
do
not
perform
outsourced
government
tasks,
are
not
agents
of
the
government,
and
do
not
act
on
behalf
of
opm.
rather,
they
function
as
independent
economic
entities
that
offer
and
run
their
own
health
insurance
plans,
performing
a
role
that
is
not
governmental
in
nature.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
we're
reading
from
the
footnote
number
3
of
the
amicus
curiae's
brief
at...
at
page
4.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
no,
no.
the...
the
amicus
from
the...
representing
cruz.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
and
their...
but
it
is--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--their
statement
in
their...
in
the...
this
is
the
government's
statement.
this
is
the
department
of
justice's
concession
that
blue
cross
has
sole
authority
over
reimbursement
decisions,
and
that
is
their
language.
that's
the
way
they
describe--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--that's
true.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
well,
we
can
also
say...
we
can
also
say
that
irrespective
of
whether
the
federal
courts
collect
it
or
the
state
courts
collect
it,
it's
still
going
to
end
up
in
the
federal
treasury,
and
that
these
are--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--the
problem
in
this
case,
in
terms
of
asserting
arising
under
jurisdiction,
is...
and...
and
in
terms
of
boyle
also,
is
that
the...
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
point
out
any
difference
in
how
it
would
occur.
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
pointed
out
by
the
petitioner
as
to
how
the
law
would
differ--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--the
preemption
provision
doesn't
apply
to
reimbursement
provisions
either,
your
honor.
it
applies
to--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
and
with
all
due
respect,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
words
used
in
one
place
in
the
statute
should
mean
the
same
thing
as
in
other
places
in
the
statute.
coverage
and
benefits,
as
it's
defined
in
this
statute,
does
not
include
reimbursement
claims,
and
to
stretch
that
preemption
clause--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--if
i
can
find
it,
your
honor,
sure.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
yes,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i'm
flipping
around.
i
have
it
here.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
there
is.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
and
it's--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--no
problem,
your
honor.
the...
the
punch
line
to
it
is
or
to
paraphrase
it,
you
know,
benefits
are
described
as
payments
for
medical...
medical
payments
for
this,
that
kind
of
thing.
but
there
is
a
very
specific
description
of
what
benefits
means
in
the
plan.
it
doesn't
include
reimbursement.
and
i...
and
i
think
it
really
stretches
it
to
include
reimbursement
as
a...
under
that
benefit
setting.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
being
a
cynic,
i'm
not
so
sure
of
that,
judge.
but...
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
so
sure
of
that
because
early
on
in
the...
in
blue
cross
blue
shield's
summary
of
the
facts,
they
indicate
that
blue
cross'
fees
in
the
matter
are
determined
based
upon
performance.
i
don't
know
what
performance
means,
but
i
suspect
it
has
something
to
do
with
how
much
money
ultimately
ends
up
being
spent.
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
relevant
to
the
inquiry
that
we're
involved
in.
the
fact
that...
that
all
of
the
money
may
ultimately
got
to
the
government,
though,
i
don't
think
changes
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
should
confer
subject
matter
jurisdiction
upon
the
district
courts
in
this
case.
there...
the...
the
issues
here
can
be
resolved
in
the
state
courts
and
more
efficiently
than
in
the
federal
courts.
and
certainly
i
think
that
the
federal
courts
would
not
look
forward
to
an
influx
of
cases
dealing
with
issues
in...
in
essentially
personal
injury
issues
involving
whether
or
not
particular
doctors
were
paid
properly,
whether
or
not
particular
payments
need
to
be
made
in
connection
with
and
are
reimbursable
to
the
government,
or
the
types
of
issues
that
we
have
here.
and
to
be
perfectly
honest,
most
of
the
cases
are
not
of
the
magnitude
of
this
one
where
we're
talking
about
$150,000.
most
of
the
cases
involve
$5,500
and
$6,500
and
things
like
that.
the
government--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
to
this
claim?
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
our
defense
on
the
merits
to
this
claim,
were
we
to
get
there,
is
that
the
government
has
paid
the
same
doctor
$17,500
three
times
for
the
same
service,
and
that
denise
finn
should
not
be
required
to
reimburse
blue
cross
blue
shield
when
they
have
incompetently,
in
effect,
paid
out
more
money
than
they
should
have.
the
second
defense
involves
the
fact
that
some
of
the
benefits
which
blue
cross
blue
shield
is
seeking
reimbursement
for
are
not
connected
to
the
accident
that
injured
mr.
mcveigh.
they're
part
of
his
normal
health
care
type
of
services
which
wouldn't
fall
under
the
reimbursement
claim.
those
claims
are...
are
not
the
type
of
things
that
i
think
that
the
federal
district
courts
want
to
deal
with.
this
case--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--no,
absolutely
not.
but--
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
--i
don't
believe
they
do,
your
honor.
i
think
the
terms
of
opm
and
blue
cross'
contract
provide
that
blue
cross
will
enter
into
a...
a
contract
with
the...
with
the
policyholders
that
is
consistent
with
its
contract
with
opm.
but
i
don't...
i
don't
believe...
and...
and
honestly,
i...
i
did
not
look
before
we...
we
talked
about
this.
i
don't
believe
it
requires
their
approval.
they
don't
get
a
copy
of
the
contract
and
read
it
over.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
only
if
the...
if
in
uniformity
of
interpretation
of
the
contract?
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
i
think
the
government
has
an
interest
in
uniformity
of
the
manner
in
which
the...
the
employees
are
ultimately
treated,
and
i
think
when
we
talk
about
uniformity,
that
that's
what
we
ought
be
talking
about.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
yes,
absolutely.
and...
and
my
understanding
is
that...
is
for
that
reason
that
opm
does
not
review
the
contracts
and
approve
the
contract
language
of
blue
cross
blue
shield.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
but
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
it
could.
mr.
thomas
j.
stock
it
could.
but
in
this
particular
instance,
the
contract
provisions
that
blue
cross
are...
and
blue
shield
are
seeking
to
enforce,
as
regards
reimbursement,
are
markedly
different.
i
mean,
it's...
it's
not
a
small
variation.
it's
a
very
substantial
manner
in
terms
of,
first,
the
procurement
costs
and,
second,
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
a
cause
of
action
blue
cross
blue
shield
can
take
the
money
from.
but
that's
an...
an
incidental.
that
goes
to
the
heart
of...
of
the
matter.
if
there's
no
other
questions,
your
honors,
thank
you.
