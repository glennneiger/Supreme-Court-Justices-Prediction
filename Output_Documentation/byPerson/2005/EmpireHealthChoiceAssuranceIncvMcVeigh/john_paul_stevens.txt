do
you
think
there's
any
constitutional
difficulty
with
the
preemption
provision
in
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
make
a
contract
preempt
state
law.
is
there
any
precedent
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
boyle
for
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
think
boyle
went
that
far.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask
this?
because
i
think
your
example
overlooks
the
fact
that
at
least
your
opponent
claims
that
the
blue
cross
contract
provision
would
preempt
the
new
york
law
that
denies
your
client
recovery
for
health
benefits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that
would
be
their
answer
to
your
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
we...
if
we
think
congress
can
provide
that
a
contract
provision
would
preempt
a
state
law,
it
seems
to
me
the
example
you've
given
is
the
precise
example
that
that
statute
was
intended
to
cover.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if...
if
it
does,
it
would
eliminate
the
lack
of
uniformity
on
which
you
rely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
affects
the
amount
that
your
client
can
recover.
and
they
would
say
that
they...
because
it
assumes
an
absence
of...
it
assumes
a
payment
by
the
carrier,
and
under...
i...
i
think
they
would
take
the
position
that
they
have,
in
fact,
the...
they
have
not,
in
fact,
paid
that
insurance
cost.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
stating
it
very
well,
but
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no.
but
the
defendant
would
say,
we
don't
have
to
pay
those
damages
because
they're
covered
by
insurance.
and
the
response
would
be,
well,
they're
not...
they...
they
are
only
covered
by
insurance
if
they
can
be
reimbursed.
i
don't
want
to
take
up
too
much
of
your
time
on
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
this
is
a
claim
for
$150,000
out
of
a
settlement
of
$3
million
or
$4
million.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
your
defense
on
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
