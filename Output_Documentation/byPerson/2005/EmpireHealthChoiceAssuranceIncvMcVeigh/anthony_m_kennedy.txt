m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought...
i
thought
it
defined
a
duty.
i...
i
agree
with
justice
stevens.
i...
i've
never
seen
it...
are
there
other
statutes
where
the
contracting
parties
can
decide
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
oust
federal
law...
or
state
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
there's
uniformity
because
the
government
wins
in
both
cases.

[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that's
the
kind
of
uniformity
the
government
loves.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
you're
not
foreclosed
from
making
your
defense
or
your
claim
in
the
federal
court.
