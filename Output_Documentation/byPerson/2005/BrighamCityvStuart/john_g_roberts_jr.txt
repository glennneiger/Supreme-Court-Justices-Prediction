chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
brigham
city,
utah
v.
stuart.
mr.
gray.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
much...
you've
been
focusing
on
the
violence
because
of
the
punch
being
thrown,
but
i
gather
they
were
called
originally
because
of
concern
about
the
noise
and
disturbance
of
the
peace
and
all
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
sufficient
basis
for
them
to
have
gone
into
the
back
yard
and
proceed
from
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're
just
shouting.
there
are
five
people
in
the
house
shouting.
it's
3:00
in
the
morning
or
whatever.
is
that...
is
that
enough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
yelling
so
loudly
you
can't
hear
police
knock
at
the
door
at
3:00
in
the
morning
suggest
that
violence
is
at
least
imminent
or
may
well
be
associated
with
what
they're
hearing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
any
kind
of
assault.
i
gather
it's
an
assault
if
you're
just
sort
of
a
couple
of
guys
pushing
each
other
back
and
forth.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
mcnulty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
there
were
no
punch
in
this
case,
would
they
have
had
a
sufficient
basis?
3:00
in
the
morning,
loud
shouting.
can
they
conclude,
based
on
their
experience,
that's
likely
to
escalate
into
violence
and
enter
on
that
basis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
counsel,
let's
suppose
you
have
a
police
officer
who
knows
there's
evidence
in
this
house,
but
he
doesn't
have
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant.
and
he
also
knows
that
the
family
is
going
to
be
reenacting
the
murder
scene
from
some
movie
as
part
of
the
family
reunion.
and
so
he's
there
just
at
the
time
where
the...
in
the
scene
the
one
guy
says,
and
now
i'm
going
to
kill
you
with
this
knife,
and
he
says,
ah,
and
he
goes
in.
now,
subjectively
we
know
that
he
has
no
basis
for
fearing
violence,
but
a
reasonable
officer
on
the
scene,
hearing
somebody
say
i'm
going
to
kill
you
with
this
knife,
would
have
a
basis
for
entering.
so
under
your
test,
is
that
entry
permissible
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
really.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no.
he
knows.
he
heard
this
is
what
they
do
at
the
family
reunion.
they
always
reenact
this.
[laughter]
so
he
knows
that
there's
no...
well,
but
that's
the
difference
here
between
looking
at
the
subjective
motivation
or
what
an
objective,
you
know,
officer
would
understand.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
studebaker,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
still
didn't
stop.
i...
i
read
somewhere
in
the
facts
that
only
gradually,
as
each
participant
in
the
melee
became
aware
of
his
presence,
did
they
sort
of
stop.
it
wasn't
that
as
soon
as
he
entered,
everything
quieted
down
immediately.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
actual
evidence
that
was
suppressed?
and
to
what
extent
is
that
evidence
that
wasn't
available
just
from
looking
in
through
the
door?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
couldn't
they
have
gotten
all...
wouldn't
he
have
been
able
to
testify
to
all
of
that
without
even
entering
the
home?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
not
by
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gray,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
have...
you
have
two
questions
presented.
the
second
is
whether
this
was
sufficiently...
sufficiently
exigent
to
fall
under
the
exigent
circumstances.
but
the
first
was
whether
the
test
should
turn
on
the
officer's
subjective
motivation.
i
haven't
heard
much
about
that
this
morning.
how
is
that
presented
on
these
facts?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
in
05-502
brigham
city
versus
stuart.
at
about
3
o’
clock
in
the
morning,
four
brigham
city
utah
police
officers
responded
to
a
call
regarding
a
loud
party
at
a
residence.
when
they
arrived
at
the
house,
they
heard
shouting
from
inside
coming
from
the
back
of
the
house.
they
proceeded
down
the
driveway
to
investigate.
from
the
backyard,
they
could
see
into
the
home’s
kitchen
through
a
screen
door
and
windows.
there
was
an
altercation
taking
place.
four
adults
were
trying
to
restrain
a
juvenile.
the
juvenile
broke
free
and
punched
one
of
the
adults
in
the
face.
the
victim
went
to
spit
blood
into
a
sink
while
the
other
adults
continued
trying
to
subdue
the
juvenile.
one
of
the
officers
opened
the
screen
door
and
yelled
in
‘police’,
but
the
ruckus
from
the
fight
was
too
loud,
nobody
heard
him.
so
he
stepped
into
the
kitchen
and
again
cried
out.
as
people
gradually
became
aware
that
the
police
were
on
the
scene,
the
altercation
subsided.
the
officers
then
arrested
several
of
the
adults
for
disorderly
conduct,
intoxication
and
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor.
the
trial
court
excluded
all
evidence
obtained
after
the
officers
entered
the
home
on
the
ground
that
the
officer’s
entry
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
utah
also
concluded
that
the
officer’s
entry
was
improper.
the
court
said
that
the
injury
caused
by
the
juvenile’s
punch
was
not
serious
enough
to
allow
the
officers
to
enter.
this
is
because,
the
court
said,
it
could
not
have
led
a
reasonable
officer
to
believe
that
an
unconscious,
semiconscious,
or
missing
person
feared
injured
or
dead
was
in
the
home;
we
granted
review.
the
fourth
amendment
generally
prohibits
officers
from
entering
a
private
home
without
a
warrant;
but
there
are
certain
exceptions.
for
example,
officers
may
enter
without
a
warrant
to
fight
a
fire
or
when
they
are
in
pursuit
of
a
fleeing
felon.
if
the
situation
confronting
officers
is
serious
enough
to
make
immediate
entry
reasonable,
the
fourth
amendment
will
allow
it.
one
such
situation
is
the
need
to
protect
life
or
avoid
imminent
serious
injury.
the
defendants
in
this
case
don’t
dispute
this,
but
make
two
arguments
why
the
officers
still
could
not
enter.
first,
they
claimed
that
the
officers
here
were
more
interested
in
making
arrests
than
in
quelling
violence.
they
want
us
to
consider
the
officers’
subjective
motivation
for
entering
the
home.
our
cases
reject
this
approach.
an
action
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
long
as
the
circumstances,
viewed
objectively
justify
the
action.
the
defendants
also
argue
that
their
conduct
was
not
serious
enough
to
justify
the
officers’
entry.
we
think
however,
that
the
officers
had
an
objectively
reasonable
basis
for
believing
both
that
the
injured
adult
might
need
help,
and
that
the
violence
in
the
kitchen
was
just
beginning.
the
fourth
amendment
did
not
require
the
officers
to
wait
until
another
blow
rendered
someone
unconscious
or
semiconscious
or
worse
before
entering.
police
officer
is
not
like
a
boxing
referee
who
only
steps
in
to
stop
a
fight
when
it
becomes
too
one-sided.
the
way
the
officers
entered
the
home
was
also
reasonable.
after
witnessing
the
punch,
one
of
the
officers
opened
the
screen
door
and
yelled
in
‘police’.
when
nobody
heard
him,
he
stepped
into
the
kitchen
and
announced
himself
again.
given
the
noise
and
violence
in
the
kitchen,
there
was
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment’s
‘knock-and-announce’
rule.
for
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk,
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
utah.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
