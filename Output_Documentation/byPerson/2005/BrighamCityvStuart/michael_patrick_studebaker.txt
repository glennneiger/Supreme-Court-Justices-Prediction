mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
there's
two
bases
or
two
exceptions
which
would
allow
somebody
to
enter
into
somebody's
home,
which
are
before
the
court
today,
one
being
the
emergency
aid
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement,
the
other
one
being
exigent
circumstances
requirements
for
the
warrant.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
neither
one
of
those
situations
apply.
under
exigent
circumstances,
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
to
enter,
and
there
has
to
be
a
warrant
to
enter.
and
if
neither
one
of
those...
actually
under
exigent
circumstances,
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
and
there
has
to
be
the
requirement
that
there
be
imminent
danger
basically
to
evidence
or
to
the
person.
and
there's
not
exigent
circumstances,
and
the
officers
have
an
obligation
to
obtain
a
warrant
based
upon
probable
cause
to
enter
the
home.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
your
honor,
the...
what
happened
was
that
the
utah
courts
found
that
the
probable
cause
was
there
for
the
emergency
aid
exception,
but
i
believe
under
the
exigent
circumstances
requirement...
or
the
exception,
that
probable
cause
was
not
there
to
get
out...
or
actually
to
get
into
the
home
on
the
situations.
but
even
if
probable
cause
is
conceded,
the
fact
is
that
the
facts
of
the
case
don't
rise
to
the
level
of
requiring
such
as
immediate
entry
into
a
home
to
bypass
the
warrant
requirement.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
correct,
your
honor.
they
would
actually
have
to
go
out
and
get
a
warrant
to
enter
the
home.
there's
not
an
exigent
circumstances
under
the
facts
that
you
presented
which
would
require
them
to
enter
the
home
and
bypass
the
warrant
requirement.
it's
not
severe
enough
under
those
facts.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
justice
alito,
what
the
officer
is
required
to
do
is
to
weigh
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
make
a
decision
based
upon
the
totality
of
what
they
see.
and
unfortunately,
these
situations
are
always
fact
intensive
based
upon
what's
seen
on
the
scene.
and
in
the
case
presented
here
before
the
court,
none
of
those
facts
are
presented
that...
that
would
actually
weigh
and
that
was
going
to
escalate
into
that
type
of
situation.
the
officers
actually
had
personal,
firsthand
knowledge
of
the
events
that
were
happening.
they
stood
outside
the
home.
they
watched
the
event
transpire
through
the
window.
the
exigency
was
over
when
the
officer
entered
the
home.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
except
for
the
fact,
your
honor,
i
mean,
the...
the
situation
we
have
is
that
is...
it
would
depend
on
whether
it's
an
ongoing
situation
or
not.
and
in
the
facts
presented
here,
it
wasn't
an
ongoing
situation.
it
ended
and
then
the
officer--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--it...
shortly
after
the
smacking
in
the
face
by
the
juvenile,
your
honor,
the
officer
entered
the
home,
and
by
his
testimony,
it
abated
right
after
he
entered
the
home.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
it
had
not
stopped.
no,
it
had
not,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
your
honor,
what
makes
that
opinion
wrong,
based
upon
the
facts
that
were
presented,
is
the
fact
that
the...
there
was
no
warrant
achieved
in
the
situation.
if
the
officer
is
entering
under
exigent
circumstances--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--that
may
be
what
he
thought,
not
the
officer--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
what's
wrong
with
the
opinion,
your
honor,
is
it
still
requires
a
warrant
under
the
situation.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
your
honor,
the...
if
they're
going
to
enter
the
home,
there
has
to
be,
obviously,
a
serious
situation
that's
going
to
arise.
and
so
with
the...
the
presentation
which
you
presented,
it's
not
serious
enough
to
require
the
sidestepping
of
a
warrant
in
the
situation.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
yes.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
justice
scalia,
and
you
asked
whether
i
thought
it
was
reasonable
or
not,
and
i
would
say
it's
not.
the...
the...
to
bypass
that
warrant
requirement,
to
enter
the
home
under
an
exigent
circumstances,
which
is
what
they
were
there
for,
it's
got
to
be
more
serious
than
a...
a
loud
party,
the
situation.
and
ironically,
the...
the
testimony
of
the
officer,
which
i
guess
there
was
a
dispute
about
whether
that
was
there
or
not
because
it's
not
specifically
in
the
findings
that
the
trial
judge
made
or
the
two
appellate
courts
ruled
on...
but
if
the
officer
entered
the
home
and
shortly
after
that,
i
mean,
he
opened
the
door,
according
to
his
testimony,
and
announced,
basically
raised
his
voice,
and
they
heard
him,
why
cannot
he
have
done
that
outside
the
home?
and
that's
the
situation.
this
wasn't
a
serious
enough
situation
that
he
couldn't
have
made
the
effort
to
make
his
presence
known
outside.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
and,
justice
scalia,
he
also
had
to
raise
his
voice,
and
our
contention--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--yes,
your
honor,
he
would
have
to
get
a
warrant.
and...
and
the
requirement--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--it's
my
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
your
honor,
i
believe
mincey
itself
requires
the...
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
be
evaluated,
and
further--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--mincey
v.
arizona.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
yes.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
no,
it
was
not
involving
a
party
or
noise.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
correct.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
correct,
and--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--and...
and
to
answer
the
court's
question,
there
is
nothing
that
i'm
aware
of
where
this
court
has
come
out
and
said
that
a
party
is--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--correct.
and
so
we--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--i
don't
believe
there's
anything
that
specifically
says
that,
your
honor.
no.
but
there
are
cases
out
there
that
say
that
under
the
exigent
circumstances,
it's
got
to
be
a
serious
situation,
and
the
question
then
becomes
is...
is
the
situation...
is
the
party...
is
the
loud
noise
complaint
serious
enough
to
warrant
entering
into
the
home.
and
no,
we
would
say
it's
not,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
rise
to
that
level,
especially
considering
the
fact
that
the
exigency
that
the
officers
relied
upon,
the
smack...
and
it
was
over.
the
situation
was
already
under
control.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
not
completely,
justice
souter.
but
we
do
have
a
situation
where
only
he
broke
free
from
one
of
the
adults,
not
three
of
the
adults.
he
was
still
under
control
in
this
situation.
and
he
had
gotten
his
hand
free
and
smacked
one
of
the
other
adults,
the
one
who
was
the
victim
in
this
situation.
so
the
officers...
unlike
some
situations
where
they're
called
out
and
they
wander
on
a
situation,
the
officers
in
this
case
had
personal
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on.
they
stood
outside
the
home
and
watched
the
event
transpire.
and
so
they
really
need
to
wait
and
observe
what's
going
to
happen
and
wait
till
the
last
second
before
they
need
to
go
in.
in
this
situation,
there
was
nothing
that
would
demonstrate
in
the
facts
that
it
was
going
to
escalate
at
all.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
they
should
have
knocked.
they
should
have
made
that
effort
first.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
reason
the...
the
trial
court
and...
is
concerned
about
the
knocking
issue
is
it's,
if
you
will,
the
baseline
requirement
under
the
fourth
amendment,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
was
to
make
their
presence
known
by
knocking.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter.
i
didn't
catch
the
first
a
part.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
that
is
what
the
trial
court--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--i
do,
your
honor,
and
i
know
that
that's
a...
a
complicated
issue,
but
it's
still
a
requirement.
but
further,
the
court...
the
trial
court--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--well,
even
if
there
is,
your
honor,
the
trial
court
did
not
just
say
that...
there...
he...
the
evidence
was
gone
because
of
the
failure
to
knock.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
exigencies,
as
well
as
the
appellate
courts,
didn't
rise
to
the
level
which
would
require
entry
into
the
home.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
i...
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
this
is
why.
under,
i
believe,
wilson
v.--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--your
honor,
first,
it
wouldn't
have
taken
any
effort
at
all
to
follow
through
on
this,
and
even
though
this
court
has
ruled
that,
you
know,
there
is
mandatory
knock
and
announce...
or
requirement,
with
some
exceptions,
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
one
of
those
exceptions.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
correct.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
yes.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
because,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
it's
one
of
the...
the
threshold
requirements
to
protect
somebody
when
they're
inside
their
home
is
to
make
that
effort.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
that
was
the
finding
of
the
court,
your
honor,
the
trial
court,
that
it
was
futile.
but,
again,
when
an
officer
is
placed
in
that
situation
to
say
that
if
an
officer
can
decide
whether
something
is
futile
or
not,
that
could
actually...
then
that
exception,
if
we're
not
careful,
absorb
that
rule.
so
i--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--correct,
and
that
is--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--personally?
yes.
legally?
no.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
i
mean,
i
am
not
going
to
try...
but,
again,
this
court...
the...
the
courts
below
did
say
that
that
exigent
circumstances
didn't
rise
to
the
level--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
your
honor,
if
i
look
at
paragraph
5
of
the
joint
appendix...
or
i'm
sorry...
of
the...
of
the
order,
it
says,
at
that
point
in
time
the
court
finds
no
exigent--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
in
the
petition
for
cert
filed
by
the
state
of
utah,
and
it
would
be
appendix
page
47.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
your
honor,
and
again,
this
isn't
the,
maybe,
best
worded
order
that
the
city
has
prepared
in
this
case
when
they...
when
the...
it
was
actually
the
city
that
prepared
this,
petitioners.
when
i
look
at
it,
i
look
at
two
different
sentences
there.
there
was
no
exigent
circumstances,
and
further,
what
he
should
have
done
was
knock.
but
further,
the
two
appellate
courts
that
heard
this
matter
before,
did
rule
on
the
exigent
circumstances
because
that's
what
the
petitioners
in
this
court
had
brought
before
the
appellate
courts,
and
they
found
that
in
both
the
utah
court
of
appeals
and
the
utah
supreme
court,
that
the
exigent
circumstances
weren't
sufficient
enough.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
your
honor--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--your
honor,
under
the
situation,
he's
got
to
make
his
presence
known.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
and--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--and--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--and
once
he
raised
his
voice,
though,
your
honor,
and...
and
made
himself
a
little
bit
more
vocal,
then
they
noticed
him
there.
and
the--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--chief
justice,
like
you
say,
once
they
made
their
presence
known,
it
dissipated.
the...
the
position
would
be
if
they
can
make
their
presence
known
inside
the
home,
they
can
make
their
presence
known
outside
the
home
and
still
protect
that
sanctity
of
the
home
that
we're
trying
to
insure
that
people
are
protected
in
within
their
home.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
that's
what
the...
the
lower
courts
have
found
to
be
true.
but
justice...
correctly,
justice
ginsburg,
they
found
it
to
be
true
that
the
exigent
circumstances
were
not
met
under
these
facts.
it
wasn't
serious
enough
to
enter
the
home
without
the
warrant,
and
i
think
that's
the
pivot
point.
where
is
that
line
on
the
exigent
circumstances?
and
our
position
would
be
that
that
line...
that
it's
got
to
be
serious,
it's
got
to
be
imminent,
it's
got
to
be
an
ongoing
situation,
something
where
somebody
is
either
going
to
get
seriously
injured,
evidence
is
going
to
be
destroyed,
somebody
is
going
to
flee.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
based
upon
the
officer's
testimony
at
the
suppression
hearing,
your
honor,
it
would
be
that
they
did
not
have
a
serious
intention
to
harm
him
is
the
fact
that,
one,
there
was
nothing
showing
that
they
were
actually
doing
anything
more
than
restraining
him,
that
juvenile.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
they
were
beating
on
him,
that
they
were
molesting
him,
or
you
know--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--i
would
say
that
they
would,
justice
alito,
and
this
is
why.
you
know,
all
that
they
were
saying
was
they
were
trying
to
get
the...
the
juvenile
to
calm
down.
they
were
trying
to
get
him
to
settle
down.
this
was
a
situation
where
the
officer
testified
that...
at
the
suppression
hearing,
that
there
was
alcohol
involved,
that
there
was
a
minor.
those
types
of
situations
don't
demonstrate
the
fact
that
this
was
an
ongoing
violent
situation.
again...
and
then
further,
the
officers
were
called
out
for
a
party.
they
weren't
called
out
for
a
fight
in
progress
or...
or
some
type
of
physical
altercation.
they
were
called
out
because
somebody
had
a
loud
disturbance
going
on.
and
those
facts
in
my
mind's
eye
don't
rise
to
the
level
and
would
show
the
officer...
especially
when
the
officer
is
standing
outside
the
home
watching
this
event,
that
there's
nothing
that...
that
would
rise
to
the
level
of
entering
the
home
under
the
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
justice
ginsburg,
i
was
not
the
trial
counsel
below
or
at
the
appellate
court,
so
i
cannot
determine
what
his
matter
was
or
what...
what
his
basis
was
for
that
decision.
and
it...
then
it
would
appear
that
you're
correct
in
the
fact
that
the
utah
supreme
court
is
concerned
upon
that
issue.
but
the
fact
is
that
it
seems
to
have
been
briefed
under
the
fourth
amendment,
has
come
up
under
the
fourth
amendment
issues,
and
so
that's
what
we're...
we're
looking
at.
and
even
though
a
state,
obviously,
can
give
more
protections
to
its
citizens
under
a
state
constitution,
the
fourth
amendment
is
still
a...
if
you
will,
a
baseline
requirement,
and
it
still
applies
to
federal
criminal
courts.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
your
honor,
the
proceedings
have
been
dismissed
against
my
clients.
that
is
correct.
and
to
answer
the
court's
question,
the
charges
that
they
were
facing
was
intoxication...
no.
i'm
sorry.
disorderly
conduct,
intoxication,
and
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
worst
case
scenario,
your
honor,
they
could
be
charged
with
up
to
6
months
in
the
county
jail,
each
one
consecutive
to
each
other.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
mr.
chief
justice,
the
evidence
was...
that
was
suppressed
was
everything
that
the
officer
or
officers
saw
once
they
entered
the
home
and/or
heard
once
they
entered
the
home,
basically
anything
that
they
obtained
once
they
entered
the
home.
the
answer
to
your
honor's--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--they
could
have,
your
honor.
however,
they...
they
did
not.
the
prosecutor
at
the
time
didn't
proceed
under
that
issue.
i'm
not
aware
of
why
he
did,
but
we
have,
though,
is
obviously
that...
that
may
have
happened.
and
as
the
court
addressed
previously,
there
may
have
been
then
an
issue
related
to
the
curtilage
which
would
have
had
to
have
been
addressed
or
discussed.
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
it
could
have,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
know
why
it
did
not
except
for
the
fact
that
it
could
have
been
built
into
the
curtilage--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
not
at
all.
but--
mr.
michael
patrick
studebaker
--no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
what
we
have,
your
honors,
is
a
situation
where
under
the
exigent
circumstances,
it
did
not
rise
to
the
level
which
would
require
the...
the
officers
to
enter
the
home
without
getting
a
warrant.
and
in
the
alternative,
if
they
look
at
emergency
aid,
to
enter
the
home
under
the
emergency
aid
doctrine,
which
would
be
the
equivalent
in
our
opinion
to
a
special
needs
assessment,
then
we
have
to
look
at
probable
cause.
we
have
to
look
at
their
intent
to
enter
because
there's
no
probable
cause
to
enter
if
they're
performing
that
caretaking
role
to
protect
people.
obviously,
the
ultimate
concern
in...
in
any
type
of
situation
is
somebody's
sanctity
of
their
home.
it
becomes
a
weighing
situation
where
trial
courts
are...
are
being
charged
to
weigh
the
evidence,
weigh
the
credibility
of
the
people
who
testify,
and
then
also
take
into
account
the
constitutional
protections
which
the
parties
are
awarded.
and
we
believe
that
based
upon
the
facts
and
the
evidence
that
were...
was
presented,
that
the
three
different
utah
courts
that
heard
this
matter
were
appropriate
in
their...
in
their
suppression
decisions.
thank
you.
