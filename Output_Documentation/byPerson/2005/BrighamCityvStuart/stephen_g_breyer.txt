justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
you?
is
there
any
case
or
anything
that
says
you
don't
look
at
the
whole
circumstance
to
decide
if
it
was
reasonable
to
enter?
i
mean,
suppose
i
just
wrote
an
opinion,
for
a
hypothetical's
sake,
that
says,
look,
there
was
so
much
noise
at
3:00
in
the
morning
nobody
could
even
hear
a
knock
and
he
looks
in
the
window,
sees
one
of
the...
a
kid
there
being
held,
who's
obviously
been
drinking
under
age.
he
takes
a
swing
at
somebody
else
and
pokes
him
in
the
nose
and
blood
starts
to
run
or...
and
under
those
circumstances,
of
course,
it
was
reasonable
to
go
in.
end
of
the
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean...
you
mean
the
noise
stopped?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
question
is
whether
he
could
go
into
the
house,
and
are
you
saying
that
before
he
went
into
the
house,
all
the
noise
stopped?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
my
question...
i'm
interested
in
the
law
of
it.
why
can't
i...
what's...
what...
the...
the
constitution
says
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
forbids
an
unreasonable
entry,
search.
so
this
doesn't
seem
unreasonable.
a
policeman
isn't
a
lawyer.
he
just
has
to
do
what's
reasonable
in
the
circumstance.
it's
a
huge...
well,
i
would
be
repeating
myself.
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
in
the
law
makes
that
opinion
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
are
two
reasons
why
he
didn't
want
to
go
get
a
warrant.
it
would
take
about
half
an
hour,
at
which
time
all
the
neighbors
are
awake,
and
they
have
to
lose
an
hour
of
sleep.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
underage
drinking
will
continue
for
another
half
an
hour
or
an
hour.
and
in
addition
to
that,
somebody
else
might
get
poked
in
the
nose.
so
those
are
the
reasons
why...
or
worse.
so
those
are
the
reasons
why
he
thought
it
was
reasonable
to
go
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
are
the
reasons
why
it
was
reasonable
to
go
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what's
wrong
with
that
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
suppose
i
were
to
say
at
the
end
of
that
it
doesn't
require
a
warrant
because
it
was
not
unreasonable
objectively
to
go
in
under
those
circumstances.
what
i'm
looking
for
you
to
do
is
to
tell
me
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
say
that
in
a
case
somewhere,
or
is
that
just
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
what
does
it
say
in
a
case
because
i...
i
agree,
at
3:00
in
the
morning,
it
might
not
appear
to
many
people
to
be
unreasonable
when
the
party
is
so
loud
that
no
one
can
sleep,
that
they
have
to
take
an
extra
hour
or
half
an
hour
or
40
minutes
to
just
tell
the
people
inside
the
house,
knock
it
off.
now,
is
there
a
case
somewhere
that
says...
i
guess,
we
could
take
a
poll
or
something,
but
is
there
a
case
that
casts
some
light
on
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
that
involving
a...
is
that
in
this
court?
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
was
that
involving
a
party
or
noise,
or
what
was
it
involving?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
wouldn't
want
this
to
be
the
party
case.
this
also
involves
violence
and
it
also
involves
underage
drinking
and
all
three
are
there
together.
but
i
guess
a
policeman,
where
he
sees
or
hears
or
knows
a
crime
is
going
on,
can
take
steps
to
try
to
stop
it
so
that
it
doesn't
have
to
continue.
and
is
there
any
case
that
says
it
depends
on
how
serious
a
crime?
is
there
a
case
that
says
if
it's
a
sort
of
minor
crime,
like
a
disturbance
of
the
peace,
you
have
to
permit
it
to
continue,
but
if
it's
a
major
crime
like
homicide,
you
don't
have
to?
