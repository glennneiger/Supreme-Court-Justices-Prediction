when
you
speak
about
a
violent
situation,
would
that
be
limited...
would
that
apply
here
just
because
a
punch
was
thrown,
or
would
it
be
enough
that
the
officers
saw
some
men
restraining
the
young
man,
or
would
it
be
enough
if
there
were
violent
words
being
exchanged?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let's
say
they...
they
see
a
fight
going
on.
what
kind
of
calculation
do
you
think
has
to
go
on
in
the
mind
of
the
officer?
they
have
to
think,
well,
let
me
look
at
these
people.
do
they
look
like
they're...
they're
strong
enough
to
really
hurt
each
other?
how
likely
is
it
that
they're
going
to
grab
some
object
that's
lying
around,
a
knife,
a
baseball
bat,
or
something,
and...
and
escalate
the
violence?
what...
what
sort
of
thought
process
do
you
think
a
reasonable
officer
is
supposed
to
go
through
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
was
there
anything
in
the
facts
that
a
reasonable
officer
would
know
from
looking
in
the
window
to
suggest
that
these...
the
adults
were
not...
did
not
have
the
intention
of
inflicting
some
sort
of
serious
injury
on
this
young
man
that
they
were
restraining?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
had...
did
they
have
any
reason
to
know
why
they
were
holding
him?
