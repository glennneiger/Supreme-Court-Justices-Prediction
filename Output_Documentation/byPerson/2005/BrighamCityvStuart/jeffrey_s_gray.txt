mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
cases
involving
safety
exigencies,
an
officer's
actions
should
be
judged
against
a
single
objective
standard
of
reasonableness,
that
is,
whether
the
facts
and
circumstances
known
to
the
officers
at
the
time
of
entry
would
warrant
a
reasonable
person
in
believing
that
immediate
intervention
is
needed
to
preserve
the
peace
and
protect
others
from
harm.
when
officers
have
reason
to
believe
that
violence
is
imminent
or
ongoing,
they
meet
that
standard.
in
this
case,
the
brigham
city
officers
responded
to
a
complaint
at
3:00
a.m.
and,
upon
arriving,
witnessed
a
violent
and
tumultuous
struggle
between
four
adults
and
a
teenager.
the
officers...
when
the
juvenile
threw
a
punch
is
when
the
officers
acted
and
thereby
prevented
injury.
this
is
exactly
what
we
would
expect
officers
to
do.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes,
it
was
justified.
at
that
time
what
they
heard
from
the
curb
side
and
then
from
the
front
was
the
same
kind
of
violence
going
on.
they
heard
that
from...
from
the
time
they
arrived
all
the
way.
they...
they
heard
the
thumping,
the
shouting,
someone
saying,
get
off
me,
stop,
stop.
and
so
what
these
officers
were
doing,
in
the
course
of
that,
is
investigating
that...
that,
and
it
led
them
to
the
back
yard.
now--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--no.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
and
again,
that
was--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--it's
our
position
that
they
could
have,
though
that's
a
much
closer
case.
in
this
case,
the
officers
acted
in
a
very
guarded
manner.
i
mean,
they...
they
proceeded
and
they
investigated
step
by
step
and,
in
fact,
did
not
enter
until
a
punch
was
thrown
and
there
was--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
the
reason
is
where
there's
a
violent
situation,
things
can
change
in
seconds.
i
mean,
it
can
turn
deadly
in
seconds.
they
don't
have
time.
even
though
a
telephonic
warrant
would
certainly
be
a
more
speedy
process
of
getting
a
warrant,
it's
not
speedy
enough
where
punches
are
being
thrown.
i
mean,
it
can
turn
deadly,
one
blow
could
give
someone
a
concussion
or
even
rupture
a
spleen.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
no.
in
fact,
precisely
for
that
reason,
the
officers
would
not
need
a
telephonic
warrant
in
that
situation
no
more
than
they
would
need
a
telephonic
warrant
in
this
situation.
time
is
of
the
essence.
violence--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--well,
that...
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--that...
that
would
be
assuming...
that
would
be
assuming
that
you
could
take
someone
who
is
threatening
in
that
manner
at
his
word.
i
don't
think
that's
something
the
officers
could...
could
afford
to
do.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
that
i...
i
do
not
know.
i
assume
so.
they
have
procedures
in
place,
but
that
i
do
not
know.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
with...
with
violent
words,
generally
not,
though
if
it's
accompanied
with
a
show
of
immediate
force
or
violence,
then
yes,
in
that
situation.
in
this
situation,
i
believe
that
officers
could
have
entered
prior
to
the
punch
being
thrown.
what
they
witnessed
is...
is
this
violent
struggle
between
four
adults
and
a
teenager.
they
had
no
idea
whether
or
not
they
were
trying
to
molest
the...
the
teenager
or
whether
the
teenager
was
an
intruder
or
what
happened.
but
they
could
tell
that
it
was
violent.
they
knew
that
alcohol
was
involved
based
on
the
circumstances
as
they
approached.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
that
minors
were
involved?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
they
knew
that
minors--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--they
knew
that
minors
were
in
the
back
yard.
they...
they
witnessed
the
two
juveniles.
they
did
not
know
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--no.
they
saw
that
from
the
driveway,
through
the...
the
slit...
slit...
slats
in
the
fence.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
well--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--probably
not,
certainly
not
where
the
state
is...
where
the
state
offers
as...
as
the
proffered
justification
safety,
it
would
not
be
enough.
that
would
be
a
different
justification
for
their
actions.
certainly
where
they're
disturbing
the
neighbors,
we
would
argue
that
the
expectation
of
privacy
had
diminished
in
that
home
because
of
that
disturbance.
but
again,
where
the
state...
or
where
the
city
is
offering
as
a
justification
safety,
that
would
not
be
sufficient
to
go
in.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
they...
they
could
have,
though
the
evidence
was
that...
and
the
trial
court
found
that
it
was
so
loud
and
tumultuous
that
nobody
would
have
heard
it
or
probably
would
not
have
heard
it.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
absolutely.
all
that
i
am
maintaining
is
that
they
would
not
be
justified
under
a
safety
exigency
to
go
in.
certainly
to...
as
far
as
disturbing
the
peace,
then
yes,
but
not
where
the
proffered
justification
is
safety.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
no.
spanking
of
a
child
would
not.
there's
no
indication
under
most
circumstances
of
an
intent
to
injure
or
abuse.
now,
of
course,
if
there
are
circumstances
that
would
suggest
abuse,
then
officers
could
go
in.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
it
certainly
approaches
that,
but
again,
what
we
would
maintain
is
there
probably
has
to
be
more
than
simple
shouting.
if...
if
it's
accompanied
by
threats
or
a
show
of
force
or
violence,
then
certainly
they
could
go
in.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--well,
it's
a
crime
ongoing,
in
progress.
so
there
certainly
could
be
made
an
argument.
now,
whether
or
not
there's
an
exigency,
i
think
that's
doubtful
because
police
could
secure
the
scene
and
secure
a
warrant
and
then
execute
that
warrant.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes,
and
certainly
where
officers
have
reason
to
believe
that
there's
an
ongoing
assault,
officers
can
enter.
now,
one
of
the
problems
with
the
utah
supreme
court's
holding
in
this
case--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--well,
this
court
in
welsh
indicated
that
minor
offenses...
you
couldn't
rely
on
the
exigent
circumstances
exception,
or
at
least
it
is
what
it
suggested.
but
certainly
an
assault,
under
utah
law,
is
a
class
b
misdemeanor,
punishable
by
up
to
6
months
in
jail,
and
that's
certainly
of
sufficient
gravity
to
justify
officers
entering.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
well,
under
utah
law,
an
assault
is
defined
as
unlawful
force
or
violence
so
as
to...
with
an
intent
to
do
bodily
injury.
now,
pushing...
there's
not
that
there.
now,
one
of
the
chief
problems
or
primary
problems
with
the
utah
court's
decision
in
this
case
is
it
creates
a
complicated
and
confusing
bifurcated
standard
that
forces
officers
unrealistically
to
choose
between
roles,
to
choose
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
enter
and
act
as
caretakers
or
enter
and
act
as
law
enforcement
officials.
well,
the
reality...
first
of
all,
it's...
it's
very
difficult
for
officers
to
try
to
make
those
kind
of
judgments
in
the
heat
of
the
moment,
and
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
a...
the
kind
of
case
where
that
would
be
impossible
to
achieve
because
officers
in
this
case
are
acting
clearly
under
both
roles.
they're
stopping
crime
and
they
are
also
protecting
others
from
harm.
we
want
officers
to
rescue
people
from
harm
when
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
to
do
it,
not
wait
until
you
have
to
call
an
emt.
that's
what
mincey
provides.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
no,
they
did
not,
and...
and
the
utah
supreme
court
recognized
that.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
just
a
matter
of
clarification
initially.
disorderly
conduct
is
a
class
c
misdemeanor,
punishable
by
up
to
90
days
in
jail
under
the...
how
it
was
charged
here.
also
intoxication
is
a
class
c
misdemeanor,
and
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor
is
a
class
b
misdemeanor,
punishable
by
up
to
6
months
in
jail.
so
that's...
that's
what...
but
the
officers...
and
again,
this
case
isn't
about
what
they
were
ultimately
charged
with.
it's
whether
or
not
they
had
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
that
immediate
intervention
was
necessary.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
not
the
intoxication.
the
intoxication
has
to
be--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--the...
the
juveniles.
but
the
defendants
in
this
case
were
the
adults
inside
the
home.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
we
anticipated
that
comment
actually.
[laughter]
and--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
--normally...
normally
intoxication...
we
think
of
it
as...
as
public
intoxication,
and...
and
that's
where
it's
usually
prosecuted
and
where
we
find
it.
but
intoxication
that
can
become
an
offense
where
it
disturbs
others
outside
of
the
home,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
well,
the
court
created
two
different
tests.
the
utah
court
created
two
different
tests.
and
under
the
one
test,
it
examined
whether
or
not
the
officers
were
primarily
motivated
by
a
desire
to
arrest
or
search
for
evidence.
now,
the
court,
the
utah
supreme
court,
concluded
that
they
did...
that
they
were...
their
motives
were
primarily
law
enforcement
motives
because
they
did
not
render
aid.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
an
officer's
subjective
motives
play
no
part
in
the
objective
reasonableness
test,
and
it
should
not
do
so
here.
justice
ginsburg,
you
indicated
that
there
was
no...
no
suggestion
of
domestic
violence.
the
utah
supreme
court
actually
acknowledged
that
where
violence
is
seen
in
a
home
between
adults
and,
for
example,
a
younger
person,
that
there
would
be
reason
to
believe
that
domestic
violence
is
possibly
present.
and
that's
what...
now,
the
court
refused
to
look
at
that
because
there
was
no
finding
that
the
inhabitants
or
the...
those
involved
were
actually
cohabitants.
of
course,
this
court
has
never
required
that
officers
have
a
certainty
of
the
situation,
only
a
reasonable
belief,
and
they
clearly
have
that.
and
in
any
event,
whether
or
not
it's
domestic
violence
or
some
other
type
of
violence,
it's
something
that
i
believe
this
court
in
mincey
recognized,
that
officers
can
and...
and
probably
should...
maybe
they
didn't
go
far,
but
it
would
be
our
position
that
officers
should
intervene
in
the
face
of
violence,
and
that's
what
the
officers
did
here.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
gray
the
initial
response
was
clearly
to
the
noise,
but
once
the
officers
arrived,
it
became
apparent
that
there
was
violence
ongoing
in
the
house
and
that's
how
the
officers
proceeded.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
utah
supreme
court.
thank
you.
