justice
antonin
scalia
what
were
they
doing
in
the
yard
anyway?
this
sort
of
occurred
to
me.
they
couldn't
have
seen
that
until
they
went
into
the
fenced
back
yard
violating
the
curtilage
of
the
property.
how...
was
that
justified?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
any
less
required
to...
to
go
into
the
curtilage
than
is
required
to
go
into
the
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it's
the
same
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
that
even
if
he
didn't
see
him
throw
the
punch
and...
and
draw
blood,
they
could
have
gone
in
just
because
they
heard
somebody
say,
stop,
stop,
get
off
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't...
you
don't
really
mean
that
if
they
saw
somebody
inside
with
a
gun
and
they
heard
him
saying,
i'm
going
to
shoot
you
in
2
minutes,
since
they
could
have
gotten
a
telephone
warrant,
they
would
have
to
had
to
get
a
telephone
warrant?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you...
you
don't
want
the...
the
telephone
warrant
requirement
to...
to
up
the
ante
on...
on
what
it
takes
to...
for
the
police
to
go
in
without
a
warrant,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wouldn't
be
of
the
essence
if
you
know
you
have
2
minutes.
i'm
going
to
kill
you
in
2
minutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
really
want
the
policeman
to
say
i
got
2
minutes,
you
know,
dial
in
and
get
a
warrant?
that's
ridiculous.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
there
was
a
front
door,
which
they
approached
first.
as
i
recall,
they
left
one
of
the
officers
in
the
front.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
could
have
banged
on
the
front
door.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there,
in
addition
to
the
safety
rationale
which
you're...
justification,
which
you're
arguing
here...
is
there
a
justification
to
go
in
to
stop
an
ongoing
felony
whether
safety
is
involved
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is
that
a
separate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
you
see
a
guy
turning
out
counterfeit
dollar
bills,
$100
bills,
and
can
you
go
in
right
away
if
you
see
him
doing
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
but
if
that's
the
case,
you
have
a
much
easier
argument.
wasn't
there
an
assault
here?
there
was
clearly
an
assault.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
thing
leads
to
another.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no.
you...
you
don't
want
to
say
that.
the
noise
alone
wouldn't
justify
going
in
without
knocking
as
would
the...
a
scene
of
a
violent
event
occurring.
certainly
you'd
have
to
knock
on
the
door.
now,
if
they
didn't
hear
you
and
the
only
way
to
get
their
attention
to
stop
the
noise
is
to
go
in,
fine,
but
wouldn't
you
have
to
knock
on
the
door
real
hard
before
you
went
in
to
stop
the
noise?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
appropriate.
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
so.
i
mean...
people--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
good
way
to
put
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
i...
i
don't
think
we
look
to
whether
he
knew
that
this
was
a
family
reenactment.
i
think
we
look
to
the
facts
that
he
had...
that
had
come
to
his
attention
which
caused
him
to
believe
that
this
was
a
family
reenactment.
i
mean,
you
know,
if
he
had
read
it
in
a
newspaper
or
something
else.
the
facts
are...
are
what
matter
and
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
studebaker,
i'm
not
sure
that
even
the
noise
wasn't
enough
to
justify
what
the
police
did
here.
as...
as
i
recall,
they...
before
they
went
in,
they...
they
heard
all
this
noise
and
they
saw
the
punch.
they
pushed
open
the
screen
door
and
announced
that
they
were
the
police.
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
only
went
in
when
nobody
heard
them.
then
they
shouted
even
louder,
police.
i'm
not
sure
that...
that
just
the
noise
wouldn't
be
enough
to
allow
that.
if
you
can't
hear
the
policeman
from
the
door,
who's
coming
to
check
about
a
3:00
a.m.
noisy
party,
you
don't
hear
his
knock
on
the
door,
can
the
policeman
not
open
the
door
and
shout,
police?
is
that
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
and
then
if
you
don't
hear
that,
can
he
take
two
steps
into
the
house?
he's...
he's
not
looking
under
the
carpets.
he's
not
looking
in
the
desk
drawers.
he's
just
shouting
police
so
that
he
can
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
people
there
the
fact
that
there's
been
a
complaint
from
the
neighbors
and
you
have
to
knock
off
the
noise.
i...
i
would
think
that's
perfectly
reasonable.
never
mind
the
punch
in
the
nose.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
hear
him
when
he...
when
he
just
opened
the
screen
door.
he
had
to
step
in
a
few
more...
a
few
more
steps.
then
they
finally
heard
him.
that's
his...
the
way
i
understand
these
facts.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
he
had
to
raise
his
voice.
i
mean,
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
going.
it
just
seems
to
me
so
unreasonable,
when
a
policeman
comes
to
tell
people
they're
making
too
much
noise
and
the
neighbors
have
complained,
that
he
can't
do
the
minimum
that's
necessary
to
get
their
attention
so
he
can
tell
them
that.
he
has
to
go
get
a
warrant
to
tell
them
that
the
neighbors
are
complaining
about
too
much
noise?
that
just
seems
absurd.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
screaming,
police,
enough?
i
mean,
as
i
understand
the
facts,
he
first
opened
the
screen
door.
now,
is...
is
that
an
entry?
he
didn't
go
in.
i
assume
the
screen
door
opens
out.
most
screen
doors
open
out.
he
opened
the
screen
door
and
shouted,
police.
now,
that...
that
doesn't
count?
he
has
to
knock
on
the
screen
door
instead,
even
though
they're
more
likely
to
hear
him
if
he
opens
the
screen
door
and
yells,
police?
why
doesn't
that
meet
the
requirement?
i...
this...
why
is
the
trial
court
obsessed
with
knocking?
[laughter]
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
maybe...
maybe
you're
taking
our
announce
and
a
knock...
knock
and
announce
requirement
too...
too
seriously
or
too
literally.
i
mean,
if
a
police
officer
comes
up
and
the
door
is
open,
what
does
he
have
to
do?
lean
over
and
knock
on
the
side
of
the
door?
can't
he
shout,
hello,
police?
don't
you
think
that
satisfies
a
knock
and
announce
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
think
you
got
to
knock
even
when
the
door
is
open.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
and
he
did
that
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
stood
at
the
door.
he
opened
the
screen
door
and
said,
police--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
he
thought
would
be
more
effective
than
knocking
on...
on
the...
you
know,
the...
the
edge
of
a
screen
door,
which
doesn't
make
a
very
good
knock.
[laughter]
