one
thing
that
was
left
out
of
the
succession
of
acts...
utah
provides
for
telephone
warrants,
and
there
was
no
attempt
to
do
that.
once
they
checked
to...
to
determine
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
enter,
they
could
have
called
for
a
warrant,
but
they
didn't.
is
there
a
reason
why
they
didn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
the
police
instructed...
the
city
police
instructed
about
when
the
telephone
warrant
procedure
is
appropriate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
connection
with
the
answer
you
just
gave,
it
doesn't
matter
then?
if
it's
an
ongoing
crime,
they
can
go
in?
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony?
it
doesn't
matter
how
grave
the
crime
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
wasn't...
this
wasn't
a
domestic
violence
case.
it
wasn't
anybody
inside
calling
the
police
and
crying,
danger,
rescue
me.
it
was
an
outsider
who
complained
about
the
noise.
so
i
am
wondering
why
you
are
emphasizing
the
prevent
somebody
from
being
hurt
instead
of
they're
disturbing
the
peace
and
the
police
have
a
right
to
protect
the
neighborhood.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
an
easier
argument
to
make.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
probable
cause
was
conceded,
and
i
thought
that
the
utah
courts
didn't
question
that
there
was
probable
cause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't...
you
can't
attribute
what
you
just
said
to
the
trial
court,
and
you
emphasize
the
trial
court's
findings.
the
trial
court
said
about
what
went
wrong
what
the
police
should
have
done,
as
required
under
the
fourth
amendment,
was
knock
on
the
door.
the
evidence
is
there
was
a
loud,
tumultuous
thing
going
on
and
that
the
occupants
probably
would
not
have
heard
him.
but
under
the
fourth
amendment,
he
has
an
obligation
to
at
least
attempt
before
entering.
now,
that's
a
statement
that
what
went
wrong
was
they
didn't
knock
even
though
it
was
likely
a
futile
act.
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law,
that
what
the
police
didn't
do
that
they
should
have
done
was
knock?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
the...
where
did
the
trial
court
say
that
in
the
findings
of
facts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
looking
at
the
findings
of
facts.
they're
in
the
petition
appendix
at
page
46
and
47.
i
don't
see
anything
that
has
been
specifically
identified
by
the
finder
of
fact
as
inadequate,
other
than
the
failure
to
knock.
where...
where
does
the...
where
does
the
court
say
it
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
exigent
circumstances?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
what
it
says
right
after
that
to
explain
is
it
would
have
been
sufficient.
what
he...
what
he
should
have
done
was
knock,
and
that
would
have
supplied
all
that
was
necessary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
seemed
to
be
agreement
that
they
couldn't
have
made
their
presence
known
because
the
noise
inside
was
so
loud
that
they
would
not
have
been
heard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
utah
supreme
court
seemed
to
be
puzzled
by
your
failure
to
raise
the
utah
protection
against
the...
the
counterpart
to
the
fourth
amendment.
they
seemed
to
suggest
that
their
own
constitution
afforded
greater
protection
to
the
privacy
of
the
home.
was
there
a
reason
why
you
argued
only
the
u.s.
constitution
and
not
the
state
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
point
was
simply
that
this
was
not
a
911
call
from
a
distressed
spouse.
this
was
a
neighbor
saying
they're
keeping
me
up
at
night,
so
that
the...
the
police
response
was
to
the
noise,
not
to
the
violence.
