justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
if
the
noise
is
the
cause
of
their
being
there
and
if
the
noise
is
so
loud
at
3:00
in
the
morning
that
it's
still
continuing
and
nobody
can
hear
the
knock
on
the
door...
they
knock
on
the
door
several
times
and
shout...
would
they
not
have
the
right
to
go
in
then
to
quell
the
noise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
the
safety
and
the...
safety
and
the
danger
of
harm,
how
serious
does
the
harm
have
to
be?
and
i
use
the
word
harm
as
defining
the...
the
threshold
for
this
kind
of
entry.
what
if
a
father
was
spanking
is
child,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
this
one
question,
if
i
may,
if
you
have...
did
the
other
side
preserve
the
right
to
challenge
this
entry
under
the
utah
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why?
what
if
they're
just
so
loud
that
it's
perfectly
obvious
they're
keeping...
getting...
the
neighbors
are
awake
and
disturbed
by
it.
does
it
have
to
be
a
threat
of
violence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
it
doesn't
matter
what's
being
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
determine
what
is
necessary
to
prevent
harm,
but
what
if
it's
not
necessary
to
prevent
harm,
just
necessary
to
prevent
noise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
the
harm
inquiry
in
this
case
is,
you
know,
sort
of
superfluous.
we
don't
even
have
to
look
at
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
we've
got
a
case
in
which
knocking
on
the...
the
noise
is
so
loud
nobody
can
hear
the
knock.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
did
knock
on
the
door,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask?
i
don't
think
the
charges
are
in
the
record.
at
least
i
missed
them.
they
were
charged
with...
what
are
the
charges
and
how...
what
were
the
penalty
for
what
the
defendants
were
exposed
to?
there's
been
no
trial.
they...
they
suppressed
the
evidence.
i
suppose
the
proceedings
were
dismissed,
were
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
the
penalties
for
those
charges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
major
matter
we're
resolving
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
among
the
evidence
they
did
have
was
that
two...
two
teenagers
were
drinking
beer
in
the
back
yard.
so
they
pretty
clear...
the
alcohol...
they
could
have
gotten
that
in
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
wasn't
kind
of
constructed
as
a
test
case,
by
any
chance,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think
the
evidence
that
was
available
without
going
in
the
house
would
have
supported
all
those
charges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
two
teenagers
in
the
back
yard
were
intoxicated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
they
charge
that
the
adults
were
intoxicated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
a
serious
crime
in
utah
i
guess.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what's
your
response?
[laughter]
