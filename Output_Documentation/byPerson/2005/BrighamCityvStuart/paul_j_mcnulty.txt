mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
police
officers
to
stand
by
and
be
a
spectator
to
escalating
violence
in
the
home
when
such
an
officer
has
an
objectively
reasonable
basis
to
believe,
given
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
that
prompt
action
is
necessary
to
prevent
imminent
harm.
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
these
facts,
the
government
suggests
they
would.
the...
under
the
fourth
amendment,
a
police
officer
may
enter
a
residence--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--well,
it
would
depend
on...
if...
if
words
are
going
to
be
the
key--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--well,
that's
correct.
it
depends
upon,
of
course,
what
those
words
are.
it's
really
a
combination
of
the
words
and
the
context
of
the
words.
here
you
have--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--correct,
your
honor.
that's...
that's--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--well,
your
honor,
if
there's
a
loud
noise
alone,
certainly
the
neighborhood
shouldn't
have
to
be
a
hostage
to
that
noise,
and
the
police
officers
may
be
acting
reasonably
to
do
what
is
necessary
to
end
that
noise.
but
it's
going
to--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--but
the...
what's
being
said
may
determine...
may
determine...
whether
or
not
entry
is
necessary
to
respond
to
an
imminent
threat
where
a
prompt
response
is
critical.
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
then
it
may
still
be
reasonable.
it
may
still
be
reasonable,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
i
agree,
your
honor.
it
may
be
that
the...
the
noise
alone
could
justify
the
circumstance.
certainly
we
wouldn't
want
a
test
that
excluded
words
only--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--justice
scalia,
in
most
cases
a
knock
on
the
door
would...
would
be
appropriate
thing
to
do.
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
well,
it
may
very
well
be
necessary
depending
upon
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
that's
why
a
knock
on
the
door
may
not
always
be
the
right
thing
to
do.
in
some
cases
it
could
be
a
futile
gesture.
in
this
case,
the
police
announced
themselves
and
were
not
heard
because
of
that
tumultuous--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--they
entered
and
announced
their
presence,
and
they
were
not
heard
when
they
did
that.
so
the
knock
is...
is
normally
the
appropriate
course,
but
in
certain
circumstances,
the
knock
may
either
be
futile,
it
could
be
dangerous,
depending
upon
what
was
happening,
and
it
certainly
could
waste
some
time
if
it
was
a
dire
emergency.
the...
under
the
fourth
amendment,
a
police
officer
may
enter
a
residence
without
a
warrant
when
a
reasonable
officer
could
conclude,
given
again
all
the
circumstances,
that
an
impending
threat
to
life
or
safety
justifies
immediate
intervention
and
the
scope
of
the
intrusion
is
reasonable
in
relation
to
the
nature
of
the
emergency.
whether
the
officer
was
subjectively
motivated
to
enforce
the
law
or
render
aid
has
no
relevance
in
a
constitutional
inquiry.
volatile
situations
involving
violence
in
the
home
can
escalate
in...
in
seconds,
and
the
on
the
scene,
split
second
judgment
about
exactly
when
the
police
officers
should
intervene
is
precisely
what
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
has
long
addressed
and
resolves
the
balance
of
the
fourth
amendment
values.
and
this
court's
recent
decision
in
georgia
v.
randolph
contains
a
clear
expression
of
concern
for
the
need
for
the
police
to
take
prompt
action
to
prevent
harm
in
domestic
violence
cases.
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--it
is,
justice
ginsburg,
to
look
at
the...
the
threat
to
the
quiet
of
the
community
as
one
aspect
of
this.
but
the
case
contains
even
more.
the
case
contains
a
punch
that
did
some
harm
to
another
person
in
a
kitchen
setting
where
there
is
a
strong
possibility
of
escalating
violence.
it's
the
additional
facts
of
that
violence
that
was
a
potential
there,
added
to
the
noise
and
the
evidence
of
underage
drinking,
that
made
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
objectively
reasonable
for
the
officers
to--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--permissible,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
because
there
the
officer
is
unaware
of
the
fact
based
upon
the...
as
i
understood
the
facts
presented,
unaware
of
the
fact
that
that
is
not--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--if
the
officer
has
specific
information--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--a
fact
knowing
that
this
is
not
truly
an
imminent
threat
or
necessary
to
prompt
a
quick
response,
then
that
would
be
a
fact
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
wouldn't
justify.
but,
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--the...
the
officer
knows--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--well,
if...
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
the
question.
would
you
please
repeat
it?
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
right.
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
what
makes
it
difficult
at
times
is
that
you
often
have
two
officers.
one
may
know
something,
another
may
not
know
it.
and
that's
why
objective
information
is--
mr.
paul
j.
mcnulty
--thank
you,
justice
scalia.
that's...
i
agree
that
that
is
going
to...
even
what
the
officer
believes
he
knows
may
be
subject
to
error,
and
therefore,
the
objective
test
pulls
us
out
of
this
question
of
knowing
the
officer's
mind
and
allows
us
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
what
really
was
occurring
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
reasonable
officer
would
be
able
to
enter
constitutionally
under
those
circumstances.
and
here
again
is
the...
a
situation
where
there
was
mounting
evidence,
and
the
court
in
utah
wanted
to
make
the
motivation
of
the
officer
a
significant
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
officer
could
enter.
specifically,
the
court
looked
to
the
motive
or
intent
of
the
officer
to
render
aid
as
one
way
to
analyze
the
situation.
and
the
government
argued
that
those
distinctions...
or
the
distinction
between
rendering
aid
or
entering
for
a
law
enforcement
purpose
is
really
a...
an
unnecessary
distinction
because
the
officer,
as
the
counsel
for
the
state
has
argued,
is
acting
in
a
split
second
situation,
seeking...
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
