justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
they
know
that
minors
were
involved?
the
record
doesn't
show
that,
at
least
in
the
preliminary
direct
exam
of
the
officers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
i
mean,
they
knew
that
once
they
got
into
the
back
yard.
did
they
know
before
they
got
into
the
back
yard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
did
they
just
know
that
minors
stay
up
late
at
night?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
after
they
went
into
the
back
yard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
could
see
that
they
were
minors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
just
because
it's
loud?
suppose
they
were
just
singing
and
laughing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
has
to
be
some
indication
of
the
likelihood
of
escalation
into
violence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
it
does
matter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
necessary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
it
involved...
it
involved
a
homicide,
but
there,
the
search
in
question
took
place
after
the
premises...
after
the
entry,
after
the
premises
were
secured.
the
entry
was
never
in
question
in
mincey.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
in
question
was
the
search
after
the
premises
had
been
secured.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
see
how
that
helps
you
because
here,
in
the
course
of
securing
the...
the
premises,
they
had
all...
all
the
evidence
they
needed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
mincey
doesn't
help.
