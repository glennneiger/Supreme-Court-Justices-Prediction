justice
david
h.
souter
so
what...
what
you're
saying
is
they've
got
to
have
a
reasonable
ground
to
take
the
first
step.
that
may
not
be
a
reasonable
ground
to
have
taken
the
second
step
right
then
and
there,
but
it's
the
same
reasonableness
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
if...
if
the...
if
the
complaint
were...
were
simply
a
complaint
of
noise,
and
they
got
to
the...
the
gate,
the
back
fence,
and
they
could
hear
all
the
racket
inside
and
there
didn't
seem
to
be
any
practical
way
to
get
people
to
come
to
the
fence
to
talk
to
them,
wouldn't
they
have
had
the
right
to
go
through
the
gate
and
at
least
go
up
to
the
door
and
bang
on
the
door?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they
could
have
gotten
through
the
curtilage.
they
could
at
least
have
gotten
to
the
back
door
based
entirely
on
noise.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
the
objective...
the...
the
objective
officer
always
knows
at
least
as
much
as
the
officers
actually
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't...
isn't
that
your
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
i...
i
thought
you
were
getting
to
the
point
of
saying
that
on
the
objective
test
that
you
urge,
the
officer...
the
objective
police
officer
who
sets
the
standard
is
deemed
to
know
at
least
as
much
as
the
officer
on
the
scene
actually
knows.
in
other
words,
we
don't
exclude
information--
justice
david
h.
souter
--from
our
objective
test
when
the
officer
actually
has
that
information.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may...
may
i
just
get
back
to
your
general
statement?
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
they
arrived
on
the
scene
and,
you
know,
a
really
wild
party
was
going
on
at
3:00
a.m.,
they
knock
at
the
door,
nobody
answers
the
door,
they
can't
hear
it
for
all
the
screaming
and
the
music
and
so
on,
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
police
could
not
go
in
to...
to
quiet
things
down?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
was...
it
was
over
until
somebody
threw
the
next
punch.
they
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
the
next.
the
kid
broke
away
from
the
four
people
who
were
trying
to
restrain
him
once.
presumably
he
might
be
able
to
do
it
again.
maybe
one
of
the
four
who
were
restraining
him
might
come
up
with
the
idea
that
the
best
way
to
stop
him
from
throwing
another
punch
was
to
throw
one
at
him.
the...
the
police
cannot
make...
it
seems
to
me
on
the
facts
in...
in
this
record,
could...
could
not
reasonably
draw
the
assumption
that
there
was
no
risk
of
further
violence.
am
i
going
wrong
somewhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
as
i
understand
the...
the
trial
court,
he
accepted
the
probability
that
the
knock
would
be
futile,
and
yet
he
thought
as
a
formality
it
was
nonetheless
required.
a,
do
you
understand
the
trial
court
to
have
taken
that
position?
and
b,
if
it
did,
do
you
believe
that
is
correct
as
a
statement
of
fourth
amendment
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
did...
do
you
understand
the
trial
court
to
have
taken
the
position
that
even
though
the
knock
would
probably
have
been
futile,
the
police
were
required
to...
to
make
it
anyway,
to
knock
anyway?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
do
you
understand
that
to
be
a
fourth
amendment
requirement,
i.e.,
no
futility
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
there
be
no
futility
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that...
that
may
be
on
your
argument
that
noise
is
never
sufficient
to
dispense
with
a
warrant
requirement.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in...
in
the
reasonableness
analysis
that
the
trial
court
was
going
through,
the
trial
court
was
saying
even
if
it
would
probably
be
futile,
it
is
not
a
reasonable
entry
without
a
knock.
and...
and
i
take
it
you...
you
accept
that
and
you
think
the
trial
court
was
correct,
that
there
is
no
futility
exception.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
should
we
require
a...
a
futile
act
in
the
name
of
reasonableness?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
one
is
denying
that.
i
mean,
we've
had
a
knock
and
announcement
requirement
for
900
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
question
is
do
you
have
to
knock
and
announce
when,
on
the
facts
before
you,
it
is
apparent
that
nobody
will
hear
the
knock
and
it
will
just
be
a
wasted
gesture.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
standard
of
the
fourth
amendment
a
reasonableness
standard,
and
isn't
there
something
bizarre
about
saying
reasonableness
requires
a
totally
futile
gesture?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
that's
why
courts
review
these
things.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
the
court
says,
yes,
based
on
the
evidence
before
me,
it
would
have
been
futile,
do
you
think
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
requires
the
court
and
ultimately
the
officer
to
demand
the
knock
anyway?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
