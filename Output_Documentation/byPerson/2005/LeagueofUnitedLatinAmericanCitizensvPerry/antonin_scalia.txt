justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
no
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
not
even
to
prevent
retrogression,
which
would
violate
section
5.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
was
done
for
political
reasons,
not
racial
reasons.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what...
what
is
your
proposal?
what...
what
is...
what
is
a
state
to
do
if...
assuming
there
is
a
political
motivation
in
drawing
its
districts,
perfectly
valid
political
motivation
let's
assume,
and
the
result
of
that
redrawing
is
that
it
would
eliminate
a
majority
minority
district,
what...
what
is
the
state
supposed
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely,
that's
not
what
makes
it
bad.
even
if
they
created
a
compact
district
but
with
the...
with
the
intent
of
creating
a
majority
minority
district,
that
would
be
a
district
created
for
a
racial
reason.
the
mere
fact
that
this
one
happens
to
be
not
compact
doesn't
eliminate
the
motivation,
and...
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
avoid
that
motivation
unless
you're
going
to
abandon
the...
the
prohibition
against
regression.
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
that's
a
surprise.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
which...
but
it's
a
perfectly
constitutional
basis
to
alter
the
map
because
we
don't
think
it
allocates
the
seats
in
the
fashion
that
our
political
power
enables
us
to...
to
provide
for.
legislatures
redraw
the
maps
all
the
time
for
political
reasons.
i
mean,
to
say
that
this
is,
you
know,
something
horrible
is
ridiculous.
you
acknowledge
that
political
motivation
is
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
even...
even
when
the
map
is
so...
you...
you
acknowledge
that
the
map
that
came
out,
after
this...
this
realignment
of
districts,
had
less
of
a
divergence
between
the
voting
strength
of
the
republican
party
and
the
number
of
republican
seats
than
had
existed
under
the
previous
allocation
by
the
democrats.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
saying
less.
less.
it...
there's
less
of
a
divergence
under
the
new
map
than
there
was
under
the
old
one.
the
only
difference
is
this
divergence
is
in
favor
of
the
majority.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
what
percentage
did
they
have?
i...
i
thought
that...
you
say
that
they
should
have
gotten
20
districts,
and
how
many
districts
did
the
plan
give
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
that's
what
they
should
have
had,
given...
given
the
voting
in
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any...
any
authority
either
in
the
text
of
the
constitution
or
in
a...
a
case
for
the
proposition
that
the
only
reason
a
legislature
can
reapportion
its
districts
is
because
there's
been
a
census?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
your
position
when
you
said
middecade
redistricting
is
bad
because
your...
your
position
is
the
only
reason
is
the
census
is...
has...
has
caused
there
to
be
less
than...
than
one
man/one
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
little...
even
if
it's
done
by
the
court.
i
like
the
way
you
slipped
that
in.
i
mean,
even
if
you
had
a
general
rule
that
you
cannot
redistrict
except
after
a
decennial
census,
surely
there
ought
to
be
an
exception
unless...
which...
which
would
read,
unless
the
districting
you're
living
under
was
never
decreed
by
the
legislature,
but
was
decreed
by
a
court.
and
that
was
the
situation
here.
surely,
that's
a
good
reason,
even
if
you
adopted
your
general
proposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'd
say
that's
a
shame
for
the
democratic
process.
i...
i
don't
like
the
idea
that...
that
there
are
a
lot
of
districts
out
there
that
have
never
been
drawn
by
the
people,
which
is
what
the
constitution
envisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
does
this
go
to
motive
or
result?
i
mean,
what
if
i'm...
i'm
stupid
and
i
think
there's
the
correlation
and
i
remove
it
for
that
reason?
i'm
not
removing
them
for
racial
reasons.
i'm
removing
them
because
i
want
to
remove
democrats.
and
you're
saying
that
if
i
have
made
a
mistake
about
how
solidly
they
vote
democratic,
that
turns
my
validly
non-racial
decision
into
a
racial
decision?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
assuming--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they're
removing
them
because
they're
democrats,
but
i'm
wrong
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
that
the
county
was
92
percent
latino
or
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
can
you...
how
can
you
possibly
take
out
any
substantial
number
of
democrats
without
taking
out
latinos?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
my
point
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
of
course,
you
want
them
to
use
race
to
manipulate
outcomes.
it's
just
sometimes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
was
going
to
say
i...
if
i
were
gerrymandering,
i
would
absolutely
want
to
leave
majority
other
party
districts
in
which
the
people
from
the
other
party
were
voting
for
a
candidate
from
my
party
with
some
regularity.
i'd
want
to
do
that.
that's
exactly
what
i'd
want
a
gerrymander
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
a...
a
minority
who
was
a
majority.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
justice
stevens
is
suggesting
that
as
a
standard.
he's
suggesting
it
as
a
disqualifier.
if
it's
not
as
compact,
it's
no
good,
but
if
it
is
as
compact,
he's...
i...
i
don't
think
he's
suggesting
it's
okay.
so
we
still
don't
have
a
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
safe
harbor
from
an
unknown
standard.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you're
carved
out
of
a
couple
of
preceding
districts,
which
is
the
preceding
district?
i
mean,
isn't...
isn't
that
a
problem
with
that
test?
