mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
texas
legislature
passed
a
new
congressional
districting
map
in
2003
for
only
one
reason,
maximizing
the
number
of
republicans
who
would
represent
the
state
of
texas
in
congress.
even
though
the
existing
lawful
map
already
had
20
of
32
districts
which
strongly
favored
the
republicans,
lawmakers
went
to
extraordinary
lengths
to
lock
in
control
of
22
districts,
moving
around
8
million
people
into
new
districts,
abandoning
concerns
about
compactness,
wherever
necessary,
and
most
importantly,
segregating
the
population
by
race
and
by
politics
into
32
districts
which
are
extremely
noncompetitive.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
which
we're
relying
on
here,
was
that
it
was
purely
for
discrimination
based
on
partisanship
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
race.
now,
they
started
out
by
trying
to
engineer
the
defeat
in
the...
in
the
legislative
process,
engineer
the
defeat
of
the
six
democratic
congressmen
who
had
managed
to
be
elected
in
republican
leaning
districts
because
they
were
moderate
to
conservative
and
they
were,
as
the
district
court
put
it,
able
to
appeal
to
voters
to
split
their
tickets
and
vote
for
them
in
2002.
by
the
end
of
the
legislative
process,
they
went
further
and
decided
to
take
the
risk
of
eliminating
one
of
only
four
districts
in
the
state
in
which
african
americans
had
an
opportunity
to
elect
candidates
of
their
choice
and
also
to
eliminate
one
of
the
hispanic
opportunity
districts
in
south
texas.
now,
in
the
latter
case,
they
did
try
to
replace
that
with
another
hispanic
opportunity
district,
but
that
was
the
one
that
we've
called
the
land
bridge
district,
district
25,
which
spans
300
miles,
linking
up
urban
concentrations
of
latinos
in
austin
and
in
mcallen
down
on
the
mexican
border.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
we--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
the
retrogression
problem
was
created
by
the
fact
that
they
had
gotten
rid
of
a
much
more
natural...
naturally
occurring--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--exactly,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
argument
that
was
made
and
rejected
expressly
by
this
court
in
bush
v.
vera,
that
we
had
to
make
an
ugly
minority
district
rather
than
a
compact
minority
district
because
if
we
did
it
the
other
way,
a
nearby
incumbent
would
lose
his
seat.
that
was
precisely
the
argument
that
was
made
there,
that
it
was
really
incumbency
protection,
and
we
had
to
make
it
this
ugly
district
to
send
that
excessive
racial
message
in
order
to
protect
other
nearby
incumbents,
an
argument
which
is
mirrored
here
exactly
and...
and
as
to
which
i
notice
the...
the
state
of
texas
offers
no
response.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
the
state
has
to
stay
within
the
constitutional
confines
of
the
shaw
v.
reno
doctrine
which
would
require
it
not
to
go
so
far
in
the
pursuit
of
its
political
agenda
that
it
creates
a
district...
has
to...
has
to
create
a
minority
opportunity
district
somewhere
that
would
otherwise
violate
shaw.
now--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--district.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
don't
think
that
it
makes
a
constitutional
difference
under
this
court's
cases
whether
or
not
the
reason
they
decided
to
place
the
district
there
and
give
it
that
configuration
was
because
they
had
a
political
agenda
somewhere
else.
the...
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they...
they
were
deliberately
trying
to
create
an
hispanic
majority
district
there,
and
to
do
it,
they
had
to
go
all
the
way
up
to
austin
and
grab
300,000
latinos
and
link
them
up
with--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--our
point,
your
honor,
is
that
in
this
situation,
doing
it
this
way,
the...
the
motivation
predominates
over
the
other
legitimate
districting
criteria,
which
i
think
under
bush
and
under--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
the...
the
racial
motivation
to
create
a
district...
to...
to
reach
out
as
far
as
they
did
to
capture--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--our
submission
is
that
they
cannot,
your
honor.
now,
if
i
could
turn
to
the
partisanship
issue,
our--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--sure.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
they
can't
say
we
have
to
create
it
in
a
noncompact
way
where
the
race
predominates
over
the
other
values
because
we
have
a
political
agenda
of
protecting
some
other
incumbent
in
a
nonminority
district.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
question
of
what
you
mean
by
the
word
predominance.
and
i
as
understand
the
court's
cases,
there
are
times
when
the
shape
and
the
extra
efforts
that
are
made
to...
to
kind
of
gather
up
minority
voters
as,
for
example,
in
miller
v.
johnson
where
we
had
a
very
similar
district,
where
race
is
said
to
predominate
in
a
different
sense
than
it
does
when
you
simply
are
creating
a
minority
district
to
avoid
retrogression
or
to...
to
stay
in
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act.
clearly,
the
voting
rights
act
requires
you
to
create
minority
districts.
it
should
require
that
it
makes
sense
that
people
make
efforts
to
do
that.
we're
not
saying
you
shouldn't
do
any
of
those
things.
we're
just
saying
in
this
instance,
under
this
court's
cases,
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
use
your
political
agenda
to
allow
you
and
justify
you
to
do
it
in
a
different
way
which
sends
this
extra
message
of
excessive
racial
consideration.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think,
your
honor,
you
certainly
can--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--you
certainly
can
intentionally
create
a
minority
district
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
i
don't
know
how
you
could
comply
with
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
if
you
don't
do
that
in
situations
where,
under
the
gingles
criteria,
that's
what
you're
supposed
to
do.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
i
actually
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
you're
right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
right,
but...
but
our
challenge
under
the
equal
protection
clause--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it's
a
little
hard
to
keep
all
the
different
arguments
straight,
but
yes.
our
argument
is
based
on
intent
there,
yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
the
argument
is
that
the
intent
went
too
far
because
they
had
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
i
think
there
are
situations
in
which
you
have
a
political
motive
overarching
the
entire
map,
and
that...
but
at
the
same
time,
that
pushes
you
to
do
some
things
which
could
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
terms
of
racial
conduct.
and
that's
what
this...
that's
what
our
argument
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
we
don't
think
it's
a
defense
in
this
instance.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
if
i
understand
the
question,
i...
if
the
question
is
is
it
permissible
to
have--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
certainly
not.
now,
we
have
a...
an
argument
about
that
too,
which
has
to
do
with
the
district
in
the
dallas
fort
worth
area,
and
i
think
the
political
defense
there
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
now,
if...
if
i
could,
i
think
that
the
whole
map...
the
decision
to
redraw
the
whole
map
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
for
a
wholly
different
reason,
which
was
that
it
was
wholly
lacking
in
any
rational,
legitimate
public
purpose.
at
the
time,
there
was
a
lawful
map
in
place
that
had
the
right
number
of
districts,
and
the
district
court
found
as
fact
that
the
only
reason
that
this
law
was
even
considered,
let
alone
passed,
was
to
help
one
political
party
gain
more
seats
in
the
congress
at
the
expense
of
the
other.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it
was
the
first
one
done
by
the
legislature
because
they
violated
the
constitutional
intentionally
when
they
had
an
obligation
to...
to
draw
a
map
2
years
earlier.
our
submission
is
that
the
existence
of
some
power
that
the
legislature
may
have
to...
to
alter
the
remedial
map...
and
they
may
well
have
that
power.
we
don't...
we
don't
question
that...
doesn't
justify
the
map.
they
still
have
to,
in
exercising
that
power,
point
to
some
constitutional
basis
for
which
they're
acting.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
we--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--we
acknowledge
that
we
tolerate
political
motivation
in
the
context
of
map
drawing
when
there's
other
legitimate
public
purposes
being
served,
which
is
to
say
at
the
beginning
of
the
decade
when
they
have
to
redraw
the
map
anyway.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
but
our
position
is
when
it's
purely
for
partisan
motivation,
which
is...
only
occurs
in
mid
decade--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that...
that
is
not,
we
believe,
a
justification
for
two
reasons,
your
honor.
this
notion
that
you
can
have
compensatory
gerrymandering
and
that
that
can
be
your
justification...
i
think
it's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
because
all
it
amounts
to
is
another
way
of
saying
we
like...
we
don't
like
the
partisan
composition
of
a
delegation
that
the
people
voted
for
and
we're
going
to
change
it.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
as
the
district
court
found...
and
this
is
on
page
85
of
our
jurisdictional
statement
appendix...
it
wasn't
that
there
was
bias
in
the
map
that
the
court
drew.
it
was
that
there
were
20
of
32
districts
that
strongly
favored
the
republicans
in
the
court
drawn
map.
it
just
so
happened
that
the
voters
in
those
districts,
in
six
of
those
republican
leaning
districts,
happened
to
like
voting
for
moderate
to
conservative
democrats
who
they
were
comfortable
with.
now,
if
you
tell
me...
i...
i
find
difficulty...
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
how
anyone
could
say
the
legislature
can,
as
a
matter
of...
use
the
machinery
of
government
to
decide
that
those
voters
should
not
have
that
opportunity
to
do
that
again,
that
that
was
a
mistake.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
my...
my
answers
to
that
are
twofold.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
court
should
hold
that...
if
that's
the
only
justification,
you
ought
to
wait
until
you
have
other
public
purposes
for
redrawing
the
lines.
but
even
if
that
were...
even
if
the
court
is
going
allow
that
kind
of
justification
for
middecade
redistricting,
it
shouldn't
allow
it
here
because
it
was
just
factually
untrue,
as
the
district
court
found.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
the
court--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
it's
a
dangerous
thing
to
do,
to
say
to
the
legislatures
of
the
country
you
can't
redistrict
for
partisan
gain,
but
if
you
can
recouch
it
as
partisan
compensation,
that's
okay.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
if
a
map
is
illegal,
your
honor,
then...
then
certainly
it
is
within
the
power
of...
of
the
legislature
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
have,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
my
response
is...
is...
factual
response
is
that
by
the
time
we
got
to
2002,
the
district
court's
drawn
map
had
20
of
32
districts,
which
voted
overwhelmingly
republican
for
every
other
office,
in
the
range
of
60
to
70
percent,
so
that
whatever
bias
was
introduced
into
the
map
in
1991,
if
there
was
one,
had
been
eradicated
because
all
of
these
democrats
in
those
districts
had
become
more
republican.
and
so
the
map
was
not
biased.
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
lines.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
you
look
to
the
court's
finding
on
page
85
which
said
that
20
of
32
districts
favored
the
republicans.
and
you
look
at
the
expert
reports
filed
by
both
sides
at
the
trial
that
preceded
that
finding,
and
the
experts
for
both
sides
said
that
the
court
drawn
map
was
a
prorepublican
map
that
favored
the
republicans
or,
at
minimum,
was
fair,
and
that
with
the
kind
of
voting
patterns
that
existed
in
texas
at
the
time,
one
would
expect
the
republicans
to
carry
20
districts
in
most
of
the
elections.
now,
they
also
said...
and...
and
this
is
a
reason
why
the
state
didn't
actually
put
their
expert
on
the
stand...
that
the
map
that
the
legislature
had
drawn
instead
was
wildly
biased
in
favor
of
the
republicans
in
that
at
52
percent
of
the
vote,
they
would
still
get
22
districts,
and
at
50
percent
of
the
vote,
they'd
still
get
20
districts.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
plan
gave
them
20
districts
in
which
they
had
a
strong
republican
majority.
now,
what
that
means
is
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
say
they...
that
given
that
opportunity
to
have
20
districts
elect
congressmen,
that's...
that's
all
that
anybody
could
reasonably
ask
for.
that's
the
only
kind
of
justification
that
i
can
even
imagine
justifying
purely
partisan
redistricting
in
middecade.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
large
majority
of
the
members
of
congress
who
went
to
washington
after
the
2002
election
were
elected
by
republicans
in
republican
districts.
that's
what
the
facts
are.
now,
they
say,
well,
vestiges
of
the
past
gerrymander
are
still
around,
but
what
does
that
mean?
the
fact
is
the
districts
are
by
now
overwhelmingly
republican
in
the
large
majority
of
cases.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
our...
our
position
is
slightly
different.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
there
may
be
cases
where
you
could
do
middecade
redistricting
for
neutral,
legitimate
public
purposes.
i
submit
they'll
be
quite
rare
in...
in
practice,
but
there
certainly
could
be.
our
position
is
you
can't
redraw
the
lines
purely
for
partisan
gain,
and
the
case
i
would
point
to
that
i
think
most
strongly
speaks
to
that
is
cox
v.
larios.
in
that
case,
the
district
court
found
that
population
deviations,
sufficiently
small
that
they
weren't
even
usually
requiring
justifications,
didn't
pass
the
rational
basis
test
because
the
only
explanation
you
could
offer
for
those
deviations
was
that
they
were
systematically
attempting
to
help
the
democrats
at
the
expense
of
the
republicans.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that...
that
might
be
a
concern,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the...
the
historical
practice
supports
it
because
the
fact
is
that
while
there's
been
a
fair
amount
of
partisan
redistricting,
whatever
one
wants
to
call
it,
in
the
last
several
decades,
there
have
been
precious
few,
if
any,
examples
of
anybody
trying
to
convene
the
legislature
before
the
next
census
to
try
to
fix
it.
it
is
extraordinarily
rare.
and
the
reason
for
it
is
we...
there's
a
general
tradition
we've
established
in
this
country
that
whatever
happens
when
those
lines
get
drawn,
even
if
it's
done
by
a
court,
you
leave
it
alone
until
the
next
time--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the...
the
reason
i...
i
slipped
it
in
is
that
in
my
description
of
what
i
think
is
the
current
tradition,
your
honor,
is
we
went
and
looked
and
found
how
many
court
drawn
congressional
district
maps
have
there
been
in
this
country
in
the
last
40
years,
and
how
many
times
were
they
redrawn
by
the
legislature.
and
the
answer
is
that
if
you
go
back
between
1970
and
2000,
there
were
36
of
them,
and
only
two
of
them
were
redrawn
in
very
small,
technical
ways,
one
in
hawaii
where
they
only
have
two
districts
and
then
the
one
in
texas,
which
was
changed
in
dallas.
it's
not--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
the
other
thing
i
think
about
this...
this
argument
about
that
we
have
this...
this
need
to
have
a
legislative
plan
is
you
invite
an
abuse
of
a
different
kind.
if
you...
if
you
say
to
the
legislature,
you
can
sit
on
your
hands
at
the
time
when
you
have
an
undisputed
constitutional
obligation
to
redraw
the
lines
at
the
beginning
of...
of
the
decade,
as
long...
and
you'll
know
that
what
that
will
do
is
it
will
give
you
the
right
to
come
along
anytime
you
feel
like
it
when
you
get
your
political
ducks--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
absolutely
what
happened
here,
your
honor.
they
didn't
make
any
serious
efforts
to
redo
it.
the
only
person--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
reality
is...
and
the
record...
there
was
discussion
of
this
at
trial
by
senator
ratliffe...
there
was
not
very
serious
effort
to
do
this
at
the
time.
the
only
person
who
can
call
a
special
session...
and
it
does
take
special
sessions
in
texas
to
get
these
lines
drawn
historically...
is
the
governor.
he
declined
to
call
any
special
sessions
when
they...
when
they
had
a
divided
legislature.
of
course,
2
years
later,
when
they
had
unilateral
control
of
the
whole
legislature,
we
were
calling
special
sessions
like
mad
to
get
the
job
done.
so--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
there
was
some
language
to
that
effect.
if
you
go
back,
though,
and
read
the
opinion
that
the...
the
judges
wrote
in...
in
2001
when
they
actually
were
describing
in
meticulous
detail
their
process
of
drawing
the
map,
he
specifically
said
then
that
they
didn't
follow
the
old
lines,
that
they
used
neutral
criteria
like
compactness
and
following
political
subdivisions,
and
that
they...
this
was
not
an
effort
to...
to
come
up
with
a
map
that
matched
the
old
map.
the
only
thing
that
i
think
really
fairly
can
be
said
about
the
court
drawn
map
is
it
did
give
a
separate
district
to
all
of
the
incumbents,
which
is
what
you'd
expect
a
court
to
do.
they're
not
going
to
sit
around
and
decide
mutual
incumbents
ought
to
have
to
run
against
each
other.
and
so
it
did
have
that
effect,
i
think,
of
allowing
some
incumbency
advantage
to
continue
on.
but
it
is...
it
is
not
true
that
the...
that
the
court
tried
to
keep
some
pattern
in
the
map
beyond
that.
the
court
specifically
said
otherwise
in
2001
when
it
drew
the
map,
and
then
it
said
in--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but,
your
honor,
the
facts
are
that
it
wasn't
slanted.
the
facts
are
the
experts
both
testified
from
both
sides
at
the
trial
that
the
map
was
fair
to
both
parties
and
that
it
contained
20
republican
districts.
and
that's
what
the
court
found
too
in
2004.
then
we
have
an
appeal
and
we
go
back
down
on
remand,
and
suddenly
we're
starting
to
hear
about
vestiges
of
gerrymanders.
but
the
court
didn't
withdraw
its
finding
of
fact
that
there
were
20
republican
districts
in
its
own
map.
that's
true.
i
mean,
look
at
the
way
the
votes
were
cast
in
2002.
there
were
20
republican
districts
in
the
map.
the
six
districts
that
these
democrats
represented
who
they...
who
they...
the
moderate
democrats
that
they
were
targeting...
the
average
vote
for
statewide
office
in
that
district
was
something
like
65
percent...
55
to
65
percent
for
the
republican
candidate.
i...
i
looked,
for
example,
yesterday
at
the...
there
was
an
election
for
the
attorney
general
in
texas
in
2002.
it
was
an
open
seat,
two...
two
nonincumbents
running
against
each
other,
two
people
from
austin.
and
the
average
vote
for
the
republican
attorney
general
candidate,
mr.
cruz's
boss,
in
that
election
in
those
six
districts
was
62
percent
for
him
and
38
percent
for
the...
the
democrat.
so
these
were
not
democratic
districts.
this
was
not
a
gerrymander
in
any
rational
use
of
the
word.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
seems
to
me
that
one
is
not
saying
that
it's
legitimate
in
1991.
one
is
saying
that
in
redistricting,
which
is
a
messy
process,
we
tolerate
a
lot
of
mixed
motives.
we
tolerate
some
consideration
of
race.
we...
we
ask
for
some
consideration
of
race.
we
tolerate
some
consideration
of
politics.
but
that
is
dramatically
different
under
the
rational
basis
test
from
a
law
that
is
passed
solely
for
political
reasons
because
it
doesn't
have
the
other
kinds
of
interests
that
are
being
promoted
and
protected
in...
at
the
beginning
of
the
decade.
and
so
there's
a
drastic
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
under
the
rational
basis
analysis
between
a
law
which
serves
a
lot
of
purposes,
some
governmental
and
public,
some
of
them
private,
and...
and
not
legitimate
bases
for
governmental
action.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
the...
the
fact
here
is
that
the
only
reason
they
decided
to
change
was
for
partisanship.
that's
what
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
the
other
legal
requirements
of...
of
the
map
that
are...
give
you
the...
the
legitimate
bases
for
redrawing
the
lines
at
the
beginning
of
the
decade
were
already
satisfied
because
such
a
map
already
existed.
and
as
this
court
said
in...
in
growe,
the...
the
court
drawn
map,
in
some
sense,
changes
the
status
quo.
you
have
to
say
what
are
the
additional
governmental
interests
that
are...
that
exist
and
justify
going
through
this
process
again
and
changing
that
map,
which
already
is
fully
lawful,
has
been
affirmed
by
this...
this
court
as
lawful.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it's...
it's
not
a
basis
that
can
justify
public
conduct,
state
action.
if...
if
it
was,
then
it
would
be
perfectly
okay,
i
suppose,
to
have
government
subsidies
for
some
parties
and
not
for
others,
or
to
have...
let
some
people
use
public
facilities
and
not
others.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
question
i
think
you
need
to
pose
is
what
is
the
justification
for
doing
anything,
not...
not
for
any
particular
line--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
if...
if
the...
i
was
trying
to
get
to
the
answer.
i
really
was.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
if
you
can...
if
they
can
legitimately
and...
and
plausibly
say,
we
are...
we...
we
decided
to
redraw
the
old
map
because
it
was
so
departed...
it's
so
departed
from
these
important
principles
and
values
like
compactness
and
respect
for
subdivision...
so
if
that's
our
reason--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
so,
your
honor.
if
all
they're
saying
is
we...
we
didn't
go
as
crazy
as
we
could
have,
but
the
only
reason
we
did
anything
is
because
we
want
more
seats,
but
we
could
have
done
even
worse,
that
seems
to
me
not
a...
not
a
justification
for
action,
but
merely
a...
a
decision
not
to...
to
be
more
political
than
purely
political.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
our...
our
submission
is
it
makes
a
difference
when
it's
pure
rather
than
merely
one
of
the
many
things
that
is
going
on.
if
i
could
take
a
few
minutes
just
to
talk
about
our
section
2
argument
with
respect
to
the
african
american--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--sure.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
we
have
plaintiffs
in
every
district,
i
think,
on
the
whole
map,
certainly
any
district
that
would
raise
a
concern
under--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes,
your
honor,
but...
but
i
think
that
there...
there
was
a...
in
the
complaint
there's
allegations
about
where
each
of
these
people
live,
and
i
think
that...
that
we
were
very
careful
to
make
sure
anything
we
were
talking
about
specifically,
such
as,
for
example,
district
24
in
dallas,
we
had...
we
had
plaintiffs.
the...
the
list
is
quite
long.
so
there
is
standing,
i
think,
for
all
of
those
arguments.
now,
on...
on
district
24,
our
submission
is
that
under
section
2,
there
ought
to
be
protection
for
districts
where
the
minority
group
does
not
have
an
absolute
majority
but
where
the
evidence
shows
that
it
can
effectively
elect
a
candidate
of
its
choice
in...
in
concert
with
a...
a
predictable
group
of
anglo
or
sometimes
hispanic
crossover
voters,
and
that
we
think
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
was
such
a
district
because
the
african
americans
in
every
case
were
a
large
majority
of
the
voters
in
the
democratic
primary
and
the
democratic
nominee,
in
virtually
every
case,
is
elected
in
this
district
regardless
of
what...
what
race
that
person
may
be.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
citizen
voting
age
population
is
26
percent,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
not
our...
our
test,
your
honor.
our
test
is
they...
they
have
to
control
the
election,
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
would
work
because
i
think
the
way
we...
we
view
what
you
have...
you...
the
group
has
to
be
able
to
decide
who's
going
to
be
on
the
ballot,
and
then
you
want
to
see
whether
there's
enough
crossover
voting
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if...
if
that
group
gets
to
decide
who--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
if
that
group
has...
has
picked
who
gets
on
the
ballot
and
their
choice
always
wins
the
general
election,
i
think
that's
not
an
influence
district.
that's...
that's--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
limiting
principles
that
apply
here
that...
that
suggest
we're
not
just
coming
in
here
and
asking
for
the
voting
rights
act
to
become
the...
the
prodemocratic
act--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--and...
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the...
the...
first
of
all,
there
are
not
that
many
districts
in
which
african
americans
control
the
democratic
primary
and
then
have
predictable
ability
to
see
that
person
elected
in...
in
the
general
election.
where
that
is
the
truth,
they
then
have
representation
of
the
kind
that
i
think
is
valuable
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
now,
of
course,
there
are
going
to
be
limits.
one
of
them
is
de
grandy.
they...
they
only
have
rights
up
to
a
proportional
level
of
their
proportion
of
the
population.
and
by
not
respecting...
not
protecting
this
kind
of
district,
what
you
do
is,
in
fact,
condemn
the
people,
the
african
americans
in
texas,
to
less
than
proportional
representation
because
there
is
no
other
way
to
give
them
a
district
in
which
they
have
any
possibility
of...
of
participation
in
the
process
and
electing
a
candidate
of
their
choice.
this
is
the
only
place
in
texas
where
it
can
be
done.
they're...
they
are
more
than
an
eighth
of
the
population,
citizen
voting
age
population,
and
they're
only
getting
3
districts
out
of
32
because
the
state
of
texas
chose
to
eliminate
this
district.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i...
i
perhaps
more
faith
in
the
ability
of
courts
to
predict
the
future
than...
than
that
brief
does,
but...
but
i
certainly
can
imagine
a
rule
where
the
court
says,
we're
going
to
require
that
there
be
experience,
not
simply
predictions
by
experts,
in
order
to
create
a
district
below
the
majority
level.
that
would
be
an
administrable
rule
which
would
give...
at
least
give
some
protection
in
situations
of
the
kind
that
we...
we
face
here.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
i
understand
the
state's
argument,
it
is
that
the
rational,
legitimate
governmental
purpose
that
was
served
in
passing
a
new
map
in
2003
was
to
eliminate
an
anti-majoritarian
map
drawn
by
the
federal
district
court
in
2001.
i
submit
to
you
that's
an
odd
use
of
the
word
in
a
couple
of
different
senses.
first
of
all,
as
the
experts
for
both
sides
found
and
as
the
court
itself
found,
that...
the
court-drawn
map
was
not
unfair
or
biased
in
any
way.
it
did
not
in
any
way
maldistribute
voters
in
a
way
that...
that
hurt...
hurt
republicans'
chances
to
elect
members
of
congress.
so
when
mr.
cruz
says
that
the
problem
with
the
old
map
was
that
a
minority
of
voters
were
controlling
the
delegation,
that
is
factually
untrue.
what
happened
was
that
republican
districts
chose
to
elect
moderate
to
conservative
members
of
congress
who
happened
to
be
affiliated
with
the
democratic
party
rather
than
the
republican
party,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
democrats
were
controlling
the
delegation.
the
anti-majoritarian
name
is
odd
in
another
way
because
the
map
that
replaced
it,
of
course,
is
terribly
anti-majoritarian,
as
the
experts
for
both
sides
agreed.
it
totally
flunks
any...
any
kind
of
standard
analysis
about
bias
in
the
map
to
the
point
where
it
locks
in
22
to
10
regardless,
essentially,
of
how
anybody
votes
in
the
state
of
texas,
and
it's
going
to
produce
majorities
that
are
going
to
average
about...
margins
of
victory
that
are
about
40
percent
in...
for
the
rest
of
the
decade,
even
if
the
democrats
gain
votes
over
time.
now,
it's
a
dangerous
road
we're
going
down,
i
submit
to
you,
if
we
start
authorizing
this
kind
of
partisan
festival
every
couple
of
years
adjusting
the
lines.
now,
we've
had
three
states
redo
their
congressional
districts
already
in
this
decade,
and
if
this
court
were
to
uphold
this
one,
i
think
we'll
start
seeing
lots
and
lots
of
other
ones
tit
for
tat
around
the
country.
there's
another
particular
aspect
of
this
that
i
think
is
potentially
dangerous,
which
is
as
you
get
further
into
the
decade,
the
census
numbers
get
older
and
older
and
more
and
more
out-of-date.
and
what
the
line-drawers
then
do
is
they've
got
the
census
numbers
over
here,
they
know
where
the
real
people
are
over
here,
and
they
can
exploit
that
differential
using
the
old
census
numbers.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
you're
going
to
say
there's
a
legitimate
public
purpose
for
redrawing
the
lines
through
the
decade,
we
ought
to
require
the
states
to
come
up
with
fresh
numbers.
the
population...
one
person/one
vote
requirements
are
so
incredibly
strict
in
the
congressional
area.
simply
to
sort
of
assume
that
these
people
can
use
the
old
numbers
when
they're
redrawing
the
lines
5
years
after
the
census
seems...
seems
mistaken
to
me
and
it
does
invite
terrible
abuse.
there...
and
there
are
mechanisms
for
getting
new
census
numbers
if
the
states
really
feel
it's
important
to
do
so.
let
me
then
turn,
if
i
might,
quickly
to
respond,
i
think,
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
what
the
record
shows
about
the
intent
for
taking
the...
the
african
american
community
in
fort
worth
and
sending
it
up
to
oklahoma,
so
to
speak.
that
intent
is
set
forth
in
pages
87
to
88
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix
where
the
map-drawer
himself...
his
testimony
is
quoted,
and
he
explained
that
we
had
to
find
a
republican
district
in
the...
in
the
neighborhood
that
we
could...
we
could
tack
them
onto
that
could
sort...
that
could,
quote,
handle
that
particular
component
of
the
current
county
population,
which
is
to
say
a
district
sufficiently
republican
that
they
would
be
completely
disempowered
for
the
rest
of
the
decade.
now,
there
was...
there
was
a
comment
from
mr.
cruz
about
how
the
district
24
was
created
for
a
anglo...
anglo
democrat
to
win.
the
district
that...
that
was
talked
about
in
the
testimony
was
the
district
drawn
in
1991.
what
mr.
cruz
didn't
point
out
was
that
in
1996,
that
district
was
completely
changed
by
a
federal
district
court
in
bush
v.
vera.
the
old
district
went
way
down
into
the
southeast
into
the
countryside.
the
new
district,
which
is
the
one
you
see
in
the
maps
before
you,
was
drawn
by
the
federal
district
court.
it
wasn't
drawn
by
anybody
seeking
to
uphold
any
anglo
democrats'
opportunities.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
frost
continued
to
run
in
that
district,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that's
a
different
federal
district
court.
i
was
talking
about
the...
the
bush
v.
vera
court
was
the
one
that
redrew
it,
your
honor,
not
the...
not
the
one
that's
in
2001.
thank
you,
your
honor.
