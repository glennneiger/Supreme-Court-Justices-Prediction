justice
david
h.
souter
now,
with
respect
to
section
2,
what
is...
what
is
your
position
on
the
relationship
between
the
predominant
political
motivation
and
the
existence
and
nonexistence
of
a
section
2
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
put
it
another
way.
if...
if
you
otherwise
demonstrate
a
section
2
violation,
is
the
political
motivation
a
defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
are
you
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
smith,
may...
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on...
on
one
problem
that
i
have
with
your
position
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the...
with
the
fact
that
there
was
a...
a
judicial
redrawing
in
the
first
place
here?
if
i
understand
your
argument,
you're
saying
that
a...
a
districting
that
takes
place
prior
to
the
report
of
a
new
decennial
census,
which
is
done
for
purely
political
reasons,
maximizing
political
advantage,
is
invalid
for
that
reason,
i
guess
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
yet,
i
take
it
it's
also
your
position
that
if
the
districting
is
done
in
response
to
the
new
decennial
figures
so
that
there's
a
need
to
do
something
to
conform
to
one
person/one
vote,
that
there
is
nothing
illegitimate
about
political
motivation,
at
least
up
to
some
point--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in...
in
drawing
the
lines
at
that
time.
how
can
we
in
principle
say
that
the
motivation
which
is
legitimate
in
1991
is
somehow
constitutionally
illegitimate
and
dispositive
in
1995?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
answer,
both
to
the
justice
kennedy
and...
and
to
me,
ultimately
comes
down,
i
guess,
to
saying
that
political
partisanship
alone,
undiluted,
unadulterated
by
any
other
motivations,
is
per
se
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let's...
let's
assume
that
the...
that
the
partisans
who
do
the
mid
term
redistricting
candidly
say,
we
are
doing
this
for
partisan
reasons,
but
we
recognize
limits
on
what
we
can
do.
and
the
limits
are
the
traditional
ones,
compactness,
et
cetera.
let
us
assume
that
there
is,
in
fact,
evidence
of
a
good
faith
effort
at
least
to
conform
to
those
districting
principles.
under
those
circumstances,
is
the
midterm
redistricting
equally
illegitimate?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
how
about
the
question
that
i
posed?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i'm...
in
a
way,
i'm
making
it
easy
for
you.
i'm
saying,
look,
they're...
they're
saying
we
think
we
can
get
a
better
deal
for
our
party,
but
we
are
respecting
these
districting
principles.
equally
illegitimate?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
difficulty
i
have
with
that
is
that
it
is...
it
is
impossible...
i
think
you
would
agree.
it
is
impossible...
and
may,
indeed...
let's
assume
undesirable...
to
take
partisanship
out
of
a
political
process.
and...
and
if
partisanship
pure
and
simple,
even
though
subject
to
the
discipline
of
districting
principles,
is...
is
illegitimate,
then
i
don't
see
why
that
does
not
imply
the
illegitimacy
of
any
districting
at
any
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
would
be
at...
least
your
criterion,
whether
we
accept
it
or
not,
would...
would
be
more
administrable
if
we're
dealing
with
the
elimination
of
a
district
than
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
question
of
creating
one.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
naac
brief
does
that
there
really
should
be
distinct
criteria,
depending
on
whether
you're
asking
to
create
something
new
or
preserve
something
which
has
been
in
place?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
it...
is
it
wrong
under
the
equal
protection
clause
or
is
it
wrong
under
section
2?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
on
justice...
justice
scalia's
hypothesis,
there
is
no
intention
to
remove
latinos
as
latinos.
and
maybe
the
answer
to
that
is
if
you're
removing
latinos,
it
does
not
matter
whether
your
motivation
is
invidious
or
not.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
your
position.
but
it...
if
that's
not
your
position,
then
i
think
there's
got
to
be
a
difference
between
the...
the
equal
protection
clause
analysis
and
the
section
2
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that
because
there
were
no
other
democrats
who
could
have
been
identified
and
taken
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't...
isn't
one
answer
that
we
were
doing
it,
number
one,
because
we
wanted
to
protect
the
incumbent
and
we
also
had
to
use
race
to
avoid
a
section
5
problem
and
a
section
2
claim?
you've
got
to
use
race
for
those
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
could
have
used
that
reasoning
to
create
a
district
in
the
first
place,
but
you
cannot
use
that
reasoning
to
create
an
offset
district
in
the
second
place
at
the
same
time
that
you're
trying
to
protect
an
incumbent.
i
think
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
would
be
implausible
as
a
section
2/section
5
justification,
regardless
of
when
you're
doing
it.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
in...
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in...
in
contrast
to
that,
however,
you
could
not
make
that
argument
or...
or
that
response
with
respect
to...
to
district
24,
the
district
in
which
the...
the
black
vote
was...
was
cracked.
and
in
response
to
earlier
questions
from
justice
stevens,
you...
you
mentioned
there
were
a
number
of
motivations
for
dividing
it
up
the
way
it
did,
and...
and
yet,
as
you
also
acknowledge,
those
differing
motivations
don't
answer
a...
a
section
2
argument.
what
is
your
answer
to
the
section
2
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
following
georgia
and
ashcroft,
isn't...
isn't
that
a
possibility
that
we
should
consider
as
a
satisfaction
of
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
the...
you
know,
the
first
of...
of
the
gingles
factors?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it...
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
georgia
and
ashcroft
to
say
that
for...
for
much
the
same
reason,
states
have
less
flexibility
in
cracking
influence
districts
once
they
have
been
established.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
do
you
say
to
ms.
perales'
argument
that
the...
the
numbers
are
just
too
precise
to
have
been
reflective
of
anything
but
a
racial
motivation,
and
that,
therefore,
the...
the
district
court's
finding
was
clearly
erroneous?
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
they
equally
precise
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
misspoke.
okay.
