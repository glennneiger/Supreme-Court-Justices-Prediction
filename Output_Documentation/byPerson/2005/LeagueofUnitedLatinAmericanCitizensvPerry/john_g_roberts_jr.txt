chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
05-204,
league
of
united
latin
american
citizens
v.
perry,
and
the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your...
your
statement
that
it
was
for
one
reason
only
means
it
wasn't
for
any
discriminatory
reason
on
the
grounds
of
race
or
ethnicity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which...
which
motivation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how...
how
does
that
make
any
sense
to
say
that
what
you're
objecting
to
is
the
consideration
of
race
in
one
situation,
but
if
it's
compact
and
the
predominant
motive
was
the
consideration
of
race,
that
doesn't
bother
you?
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
back
door
way
to
get
into
a
more
extensive
judicial
review
of
the
compactness
and
based
on
racial
considerations
that
are,
under
your
view,
the
predominant
factor
in
each
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
can
take
race
into
account
if
it's
compact
as
a
predominant
motive.
you
can't
take
race
into
account
if
it's
not
compact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
a
dominant
motive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
it
correct,
though,
that
a
result
is...
focus
on
results
is
not
sufficient
if
the
challenge
is
an
equal
protection
one
and
not
a
section
2
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
district
25.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
asked
earlier
that
your...
your
statement
that
all
of
this
was
done
with
a
political
motive...
i
wondered
how
that
satisfied
the
equal
protection
requirement,
not
the
section
2
requirement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
counsel,
just
take
it
in...
in
an
abstract
way.
if
you
think
that
the
prior
system
has
been
gerrymandered
by
the
party
in
power,
are
you
saying
that
when
that
shift
in
power
in
the
statewide
offices
changes,
that
the
new
party
in
power
cannot
redress
the
gerrymandering
of
its
predecessor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let
me
give
you
another
parallel.
let's
suppose
that
districts
have
been
gerrymandered
for
racially
discriminatory
purposes
for
years.
can
you
take
race
into
account
in
drawing
new
districts
to
remedy
that
racial
discrimination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
now,
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
that
the
reason
these
lines
were
not
redrawn
at
the
beginning
of
the
decade,
because
the
majority
party
sat
on
its
hands?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
was
the
percentage
of
the
african
american
voters
in
the
district
as
a
whole?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
you
had
a
situation
where
it's
40
percent
one
group,
40
percent
another
group,
and
20
percent
where
the
20
percent
controlled
who
was
elected
by
siding
with
one
group
or
the
other
group,
then
you
would
say
that
that
was
an
influence
district
for
that
small...
the
smallest
group
in
the
district?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
ms.
perales.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
that
undermine
the
assumption
that
there's...
they're
voting
as
a
bloc?
30
percent
of
the
group
is
voting
for
one
candidate.
is
that
sufficient
to
establish
a
voting
bloc?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i...
can
i...
i
don't
understand...
i
think
your
argument
is
at
cross
purposes.
i
mean,
the
one
point...
and
you're
making
the
point
that
the
democrats
do
not
vote
overwhelmingly
for
the
democratic
candidate.
they
voted
as
much
as
30
percent
for
bonilla.
but
the
voting
rights
act
is
concerned
with
whether
or
not
a
group
voting
ethnically
as
a
bloc
can
vote
for
candidates
of
its
choice.
well,
if
they're
30/70,
it's
not...
it's
hard
to
think
of
them
as
having
a
clear
candidate
of
choice.
so
what
does
it
matter
whether
they're
in
or
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
the
percentage
goes
up,
the
percentage
goes
down.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
depends
on
who's
running
against
him.
at
the
low
point,
there
was
a
popular
hispanic
candidate
running
against
him
in
some
of
those
elections.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
predicate
for
coverage
under
the
voting
rights
act
that
a
particular
group
is
being
denied
the
opportunity
to
elect
a
candidate
of
its
choice
doesn't
even
come
into
play
if
you're
right
that
the...
the
vote
is
split
over
time,
depending
on
the
circumstances
in
a
particular
election.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then...
well,
but
then...
and
this
is
why
i
say
it's
an
argument
at
cross
purposes.
if
you're
right
about
that,
then
the
assumption
that
the
hispanic
voters
are
going
to
be
voting
democratic
is
not
one
that
was
unfounded,
which
i
thought
was
your...
your
first
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
just
the
state
that's
saying
it,
though.
you
have
a
district
court
finding
that
ethnicity
was
not
the
predominant
factor,
that
politics
was
the
predominant
factor.
maybe...
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
maybe
they
were
right,
maybe
they
were
wrong,
but
the
point
was
that
it
was
being
done
for
political
purposes
not
for
ethnic
purposes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that...
and
what
relevance
does
that
have?
what
provision
of
the
constitution
prevents
you
from
leaving
a
majority
of
one
group
in
a
district
to
create
the
impression
that
the
district
supports
a
particular
candidate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
passed
for,
to
avoid
creating
the
impression
that
a
particular
group
supports
a
particular
candidate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
how
many...
what
percentage
would
they
have
shifted
from
making
it
look
like
a
hispanic
opportunity
district
with
about
51
percent
to
when
it
would
actually
be
one?
what
percentage
does
it
shift
from
being
looking
like
one
to
being
one,
both
above
a
majority?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what's
the
number?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
your
number?
it
has
to...
anything
short
of
63,
it's
just
looking
like
it?
i
mean,
really,
you're
asking
us
to
draw
a
very
fine
line
between
a...
in
each
case
a
majority
hispanic
voting
age
district,
but
in
one
case,
it's
a
constitutional
violation
and
in
the
other
case,
it's...
it's
required
by
the
voting
rights
act.
so
what
is
the
magic
number
between
51
and
63?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
the
number?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
this
district
were
drawn
with
60
percent,
you
would
say
that's
just
to
make
it
look
like
a
hispanic
district?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
so
what's
the
number?
it's...
it's
somewhat
more
than
51
percent
because
you're
saying
that's
a
constitutional
violation,
and
i
want
to
know
how
many
more
it
takes
before
it
becomes
what's
required
under
the
voting
rights
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
the
number.
if
you're
asking
us
to
rule
on
a
constitutional
violation,
i'm
asking
to
find
out
what
the
number
is
that
changes
it
from
a
political
nuance
to
a
hispanic
opportunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
it
have
been
better--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--would
it
have
been
better
in
your
view
if
they
had
excluded
more
hispanics
so
it
didn't
look
like
a
hispanic
opportunity
district?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and...
and
that
would
have
been
preferable.
it
would
have
been
preferable
to
you
if
it
was,
say,
45
percent
hispanic
rather
than
50.8,
or
whatever
it
was.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
may
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
perales.
mr.
cruz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
do
we
look
at
to
determine
that?
i
know
what
we
said
in
de
grandy,
but
i
mean
how...
i
mean,
you
talk
about
the
south
and
west
texas.
i
mean,
on
the
other
hand,
23
and
25
are
actually
not
that
close
together.
so
how
do
we
know
that
we
should
be
looking
at
all
the
way
from
el
paso
to
the
gulf,
as
opposed
to
a
narrower
area?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
didn't
understand
ms.
perales'
argument
to
concern
section...
district
25
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
why
was
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
a...
a
section
5
argument
with
respect
to
district
25
as
opposed
to
a
section
2
argument
involving
district
23?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
permissible
for
a
legislature
concerned
with
section
5
to
take
race
and
ethnicity
in
account...
into
account
in
drawing
a
district?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
can
i
move
you
south
and
west
again,
back
to
district
23?
how
do
we
tell...
as
redrawn,
it
had
what?
50.8
percent.
and
i
gather
that
that's
not
considered
a
hispanic
opportunity
district
because
of
lower
voting
turnout,
registration,
participation?
how
do
we
tell
when
something
is
being
done
to
make
it
look
like
a
hispanic
district
and,
instead,
when
it's
being
done
for
the
opportunity
of
providing
a
hispanic
opportunity
district
if
voter
turnout
and
registration
are
increased?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
jump
in
whenever
you
want.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
talking
about
district
25.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
they
have...
why
did
have
just
50.3
percent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're
doing
that
to
make
it
look
like
whoever
was
elected
had
hispanic
support
in
that
district?
is
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
cruz.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not...
not
including
23.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
say
they
drew,
you
mean
gi
forum
proposal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
smith,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
was
the...
who
was
the...
the
candidate
in
that
district
after
the
district
court
plan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
didn't
the
district
court
say
one
of
its
criteria
was
preserving
incumbency?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
justice
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
in
