mr.
r.
ted
cruz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
issue
in
resolving
these
various
challenges
to
mid-decade
redistricting
is
determining
which
institution
is
constitutionally
vested
with
the
primary
responsibility
for
redistricting.
elected
legislatures
or
federal
courts.
in
texas,
for
the
first
time
in
12
years,
the
legislature
acted
to
adopt
a
congressional
redistricting
map.
that
map,
in
turn,
replaced
one
of
the
most
profoundly
anti-majoritarian
congressional
maps
in
the
country
with
a
map
that
reflects
the
demonstrated
preferences--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
legislature
replaced
the
court-ordered
map,
but
the
court
found
as
a
factual
matter
that
the
court-ordered
map,
in
the
court's
words,
quote,
perpetuated
the
1991
democratic
party
gerrymander,
and
that
was
the
court
characterizing
its
own
map
with
the
same
judges.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
the
court's
map,
under
the--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--yes.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
yes,
we
do.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
district
court
found
that
it
had
blunted
some
of
the
most
egregious
lines,
but
under
the
district
court's
map,
28
of
28
incumbents
were
reelected.
so
the
identical
outcome
was
yielded.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that...
that
is
correct,
and
then
the
district
court--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it...
it
depends.
the
districts
were
drawn
such
that
the
democrats
who
were
running
were
incumbency.
and
the
reality
of
congressional
elections
is
that
incumbency
is
a
tremendous
advantage,
and
in
the
face
of
incumbency--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--and
that's
exactly
right.
these
districts
were
drawn
to
protect
incumbents.
it
is
notable
that
if
one
looks
on
a
national
level,
the
2001
map
drawn
by
the
court
led
to
the
most
anti-majoritarian
results
of
any
of
the
50
states
in
the
union.
there
were
only
two
other
states
with
more
than
five
members
of
congress
that
saw
a
minority
of
voters
electing
a
majority
of
the
delegation,
and
those
were
illinois
and
tennessee.
in
each
of
those,
49
percent
in
illinois
elected
one
extra
seat
to
congress;
in
tennessee,
48
percent.
in
texas,
by
contrast,
45
percent
of
the
two-party
vote
and
41
percent
of
the
overall
state
vote
elected
not
just
a
one-seat
majority,
but
a
two-seat
majority.
so
on
any
national
level,
the
prior
map
was
the
most
profoundly
anti-majoritarian.
now,
this
court
resolved
in...
in
vieth
that
majoritarianism
is
not
a
constitutional
mandate,
but
that
being
said,
as
mr.
smith
characterized
in
vieth,
he
characterized
the
fundamental
principle
of
democracy...
and
this
is
mr.
smith's
characterization...
is
the
principle
that
a
majority
can
elect
a
majority
of
the
delegation.
and
as
this
court
concluded
in
gaffney
v.
cummings,
achieving
political
fairness,
achieving
a
rough
sense
of
proportionality,
such
that
a
majority
can
elect
a
majority
of
the
delegation,
is
not
only
legitimate,
it
is
salutary.
it
is--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
breyer,
under
the
standard
articulated
in
your
opinion
in
vieth,
in
our
judgment
the
result
would
be
a
straightforward
affirmance
here
because
the
map
that
was
adopted
is
precisely
what
was
advocated
in
vieth
of
a
majority
of
the
population
electing
a
majority
of
the
delegation.
that
being
said,
the
question
here
is
not
whether
that
is
required.
indeed,
it
is
ironic.
in
1992
the
republicans
in
texas
brought
a
political
gerrymandering
challenge
to
the
predecessor
map
here,
and
that
map
was
rejected...
that
challenge
was
rejected
under
bandemer,
and
the
district
court
in
1992
told
the
republican
plaintiffs...
said
even
though
this
may
be
tilted
against
you,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
you,
over
the
ensuing
decade,
from
running
candidates,
from
building
support,
and
from
eventually
taking
control
by
electing
your
candidates
to
the
machinery
of
government
and
adopting
a
map
you
deem
fair.
that...
those
words
of
the
district
court
prove
prescient
because
that
is
precisely
what
happened
over
the
ensuing
decade,
and
it
is
equally
true
today.
there
is
nothing
in
texas
to
prevent
the
democratic
party
from
doing
the
exact
same
thing
over
the
ensuing
decade
if
they
can
command
a
majority
of
votes
at
the
polls.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
of
course,
it
does
not,
and
there
are
a
variety
of
district-specific
attacks.
the
plaintiffs
have
framed
their
partisan
gerrymandering
attack
as
one
that
focuses
on
the
map
as
a
whole.
and...
and
the--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
the
vieth
decision,
justice
kennedy's
concurrence
was
the
controlling
concurrence,
and
it
set
out
a
standard
for
subsequent
partisan
gerrymandering
cases
that
litigants
should
find
a,
quote,
substantive
definition
of
fairness
in
districting
that
commands
general
assent.
rather
than
attempt
to
meet
that
challenge,
the
plaintiffs
have
refused
to
discuss
effects
at
all,
and
that's
not
by
accident
because
any
assessment
of
effects
would
yield
that
the
current
plan
is
more
fair
than
the
predecessor.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
legislature
made
a
policy
judgment,
and
under
the
decision--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--there
were
a
host
of--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--there
were
a
host
of
judgments
about
the
multiple
districts
that
district
24
was
broken
into,
and
the
district
court
found,
for
example,
that
representative
grusendorf
wanted
the
city
of
arlington
contained
in
one
single
district.
there
were
a
whole
host
of
specific
motivations
about
the
surrounding
districts
that
were
drawn.
indeed,
the
district
court
said
on
remand
that
appellants'
argument
ignores,
as
it
must,
the
reality
that
the
lines
are
infused
with
the
myriad
mixtures
of
local
politics
and
accommodations,
often
inconsistent
with
overall
objectives
of
partisan
gains.
that
was
the
district
court's
finding
on
remand,
that
there
are
a
host
of
decisions
here
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
partisan
gain,
that
have
to
do
with
drawing
a
map
that
are
the
constitutional
responsibility
of
a
legislature
in
drawing
a
redistricting
map.
appellants
frame
their
basic
challenge
on
partisan
gerrymandering
because
they
cannot
look
at
effects,
because
any
examination
of
substantive
effects
yields
the
conclusion
that
the
current
map
is
much
more
fair
than
the
prior.
they
disavow
any
examination
of
effects.
instead,
they
frame
it
as
solely
partisan
intent,
which
has
never
been
the
standard
under
this
court's
precedents.
but
even
under
that
standard,
they
base
it
on
a
simple
syllogism
that
is
found
nowhere
in
the
court's
precedents,
a
syllogism
that
says
because
there
was
an
extant
legal
map
in
place,
the
redistricting
was
unnecessary.
and
so
anytime
there
is
a
court
map,
it
is
unnecessary
redistricting.
the
problem
is
appellants
raise
a
false
dichotomy
because
every
legislative
redistricting
is
voluntary.
whether
it
is
texas
in
2003
or
pennsylvania
in
2001,
the
legislatures
face
a
binary
choice.
they
can
act
and
adopt
their
legislative
policy
preferences,
or
they
can
not
act,
in
which
case
they
know
with
an
absolute
certainty
that
a
court-drawn
map
will
govern
the
election
that
follows.
in
pennsylvania,
to
be
sure,
it
was
a
map
that
would
be
drawn
subsequently,
but
the
decision
is
the
same.
does
the
legislature
act
to
embody
its
preferences
or
does
it
allow
a
court-drawn
map
to
govern
the
elections
in
the
states?
and
i
would
note
the
consequence
of
the
rule
that
appellants
are
urging
is
that
it
would
create
an
enormous
incentive
for
the
minority
party
in
every
state
to
attempt
to
deadlock
the
system,
to
shut
down
at
the
beginning
of
the
decade
any
effort
to
adopt
a
map
because
if
they're
able
to
deadlock
the
system,
if
they
are
able,
as
happened
in
texas,
to
flee
the
state
and
no
map
passes,
the
consequence
of
that...
they
would
know
for
certain
under
appellants'
rule...
is
a
court
will
draw
the
map.
and
under
the
upham
standard,
the
court
map
will
reflect
the
preexisting
policy
judgments
of
the
predecessor
legislature.
so
any
minority
party
has
an
incentive.
if
they
can
stop
it
from
happening
at
the
beginning
of
the
decade,
they
have
an
incentive
to
seek
a
better
map.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
indeed,
yes.
that...
that
is
predicated
upon
a
preference
for
a
decade
ago
rather
than
what
would
be
adopted
now.
the
framers
chose
political
checks
for
the
problem
of
partisan
gerrymandering.
they
assigned
principal
responsibility
to
elected
state
legislatures
whom
they
certainly
knew
would
care
a
great
deal
about
politics,
and
they
assigned
supervisory
authority
to
another
elected
legislature,
congress.
the
appellants
point
to
a
host
of
perceived
policy
problems
about
the
specter
of
seriatim
redistricting
of
legislatures
coming
back
every
2
years
and
tweaking
the
line
here
and
tweaking
the
line
there.
to
the
extent
that
is
a
problem,
congress
is
the
institution
constitutionally
authorized
to
address
it,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
there
is
a
looming
threat
of
seriatim
redistricting.
it
didn't
happen
here.
it
was
the
first
time
in
12
years
the
legislature
had
acted.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
as
the
hypothetical
is...
is
asked,
the
answer
would
be
no.
but...
but
the
difficulty
is
if
the
motivation...
if
there's
a
violation
of
section
2,
a
political
motivation
does
not
excuse
it.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
court
has
concluded
before--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--right,
right,
that...
that
a...
a
section
2
violation
in
one
area
cannot
be
corrected
with
a
discrete
change
in
a
different
area.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
however,
in
de
grandy,
the
court
also
said
that
the
assessment
is
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
the
region
under-assessed.
and
in
the
totality
of
circumstances,
the
district
court
made
factual
findings
against
the
plaintiffs
that
they
cannot
demonstrate
were
clearly
erroneous.
indeed,
that...
that
is
the
problem
with
all
of
the
district-specific
claims
that
all
of
the
sets
of
plaintiffs
have
brought
is
that
this
was
tried
in
a
full
trial.
the
district
court
took
testimony,
made
credibility
determinations--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--if
they
are
wholly
different
areas--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
court
has
concluded
no.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
if
they
are--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that's
correct.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
they
are
not
that
relatively
close
together,
but...
but
that
is
because
this
region
of
texas
is...
is
vast
and...
and
relatively
lightly
populated.
and
so
district
23,
for
example,
runs
800
miles
in
length
because
you've
got
miles
and
miles
of...
of
desert
land
and
open
ranch
land
with
very
low
population.
the
way
the
court
did
it
in
de
grandy,
which
is
also
the
way
the
court
should
do
so
here,
is
to
look
at
what
the
parties
agreed
to
and
how
they
litigated
the
case.
in
this
case,
everyone
litigated
the
district
23
section
2
claim
with
a
focus
on
south
and
west
texas.
indeed,
what
speaks
volumes
is
that
if
one
examines
the
demonstration
map
that
the
gi
forum
appellants
introduced,
which
is
at
their...
their
appendix
to
their
jurisdictional
statement,
page
241,
that
map
only
covered
south
and
west
texas.
they
proposed
no
districts
for
the
rest
of
the
state.
they
were
focused--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
did
not,
and...
and,
indeed,
she
has
never
joined
in
the
racial
gerrymandering
claim
that
has
been
brought
by
the...
by
the
jackson
plaintiffs.
her
claim
has
focused
on...
as...
as
it
concerns
racial
gerrymandering,
not
that
the
legislature
did
too
much
of
it,
but...
but
in
a
sense
that
it
should
have
done
more.
it
should
have
been
more
aggressive
in
seeking
to
create
majority
minority
districts.
and...
and
the
district
court
has
factual
findings
that
rule
against
those
claims.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
there
are
multiple
reasons,
justice
breyer.
as
an
initial
matter,
the
district
court
found
on
page
131a
of
the
jackson
appendix
to
their
jurisdictional
statement
that
cd
23
was
not
an
effective
minority
opportunity
district.
so
that's
a
direct
finding
that
the...
that
the
old
cd
23
was
not
an
effective
minority
opportunity
district.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
because
the...
the
data
demonstrated
that
a
majority
of
hispanic
voters
were
not
able
to
elect
their
candidate
of
choice.
although
congressman
bonilla
consistently
commanded
a
significant
percentage
of
hispanic
votes,
he
did
not
command
a
majority,
and
the
candidate
for
whom
a
majority
voted
did
not
prevail
in
the
congressional
election.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
what
the
legislature
did...
the
legislature's
express
intention
was
to
shore
up
congressman
bonilla's
electoral
chances,
and...
and
it
was
explicitly
because
congressman
bonilla
is
a
valued
member
of
the
delegation
and
the
legislature
made
a
judgment
that
they
wanted
to
increase
his
margin
of
victory.
one--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we
did
not--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we
did
not
place
our
principal
emphasis,
with
respect
to
25,
on
the
voting
rights
act's
concerns
potentially
raised
by
the
alterations
in
23.
that
was
a
motivation,
but
it's
not
our
principal
motivation.
our
principal
argument
on
25
is
that
there
are
a
series
of
factual
findings
the
district
court
made
that
are
not
clearly
erroneous
and,
indeed,
we
would
submit,
are...
are
completely
supported
by
the
record
to--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
legislature
was
certainly
concerned
about
section
5,
and
with
respect
to
the
adjustment
in...
in
district
23,
it
was
possible
that
the
department
of
justice
might
deem
the
alteration
of
district
23
to
be
something
that
would
be
retrogressive
and,
accordingly,
having
a
district
that
was...
a
performing
hispanic
opportunity
district
would
increase
the
chances
of
preclearance.
so...
so
that
was
a
factor
in
the
consideration,
was
a
desire
to
comply
with
section
5
and
also
to
comply
with
section
2,
although
section
5
was
the...
the
principal
focus
of
the
legislative
discussion.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
this
court
has
never
squarely
resolved
that.
this
court
has
assumed
in
the
racial
gerrymandering
cases,
assumed
without
deciding,
that
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act
is
a
compelling
interest.
and
the...
the
districts
that
have
struck
down
have
been
struck
down
as
not
being
narrowly
tailored.
although
we
advance
that
argument,
we
don't
have
to
prevail
on
that
argument
for
district
25
to
survive
the
racial
gerrymandering
claim.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
except
the
district
court
found
as
a
factual
matter
that
what
happened
in
district
23
was
wholly
political.
it
was
not
racial,
so
that
the
voters
were
not
removed
because
of
race.
they
were
removed
because
of
politics.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the...
the
legislature
was
aware
of...
as
this
court
has
said,
the
legislature
will
always
be
aware
of
the
racial
composition
of
a
district.
but
the
legislature
specifically...
for
example,
unlike
bush
v.
vera,
there
are
no
bloc-level
cuts
based
on
race.
indeed,
in
district
23,
what
the
legislature
did,
by
and
large,
is
go
straight
down
interstate
35
which
cuts
right
in
the
middle
of
webb
county.
now,
if
one
considers
webb
county,
there...
there
are
two
halves
of
it.
there
is
the
half
that
moved
into
new
district
28.
now,
those
voters
presumably
cannot
complain
about
being
disenfranchised
in
that.
at
least
the
hispanic
voters
there
are
now
in
a
unquestionably
performing
hispanic
opportunity
district
that
elects
an
hispanic
democrat
to
congress.
the
remaining
voters
in
webb
county...
in
2004,
congressman
bonilla
carried
a
majority
of
webb
county,
and
so
it
is
difficult
to
see
who
is
being
disenfranchised,
given
that
both
halves
of
webb
county
are
electing
a
congressman
for
whom
a
majority
of
their
voters
are
voting.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
as
you
know,
justice
souter,
purpose
under
the
'82
amendment
is
irrelevant
to
section
2.
it
is
an
effects-only
test,
and...
and
the
district
court
had
a
series
of
factual
findings,
most
of
which
appellants
did
not
even
challenge
until
their
reply
brief,
each
of
which
is
independently
sufficient
to
defeat
their
claim.
the...
the
district
court
found
against
them
on
all
three
prongs
of
gingles,
and
those
findings
were
fully
supported
by
the
record.
as
an
initial
matter,
the
appellants
attempted
to
frame
this
as
debating
the
legal
question
over
whether
50
percent
is
an
absolute
barrier.
the
district
court
concluded
that
it
needn't
resolve
that
question
because
the
facts
here
presented
no
opportunity
to
determine
if
there
might
be
some
tolerable
deviation
below
50
percent.
in
this
case,
african
american
voters
in
old
district
24
comprise
less
than
22
percent
of
the
voting
age
population.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
in
our
judgment,
georgia
against
ashcroft
expanded
the
flexibility
for
states
to
determine
how
to
comply
with
the
voting
rights
act.
georgia
against
ashcroft
obviously
was
a
section
5
case,
and
it
determined
that
in
considering
retrogression,
that
opportunity
districts
and
influence
districts
should
both
be
considered.
it
surely
did
not
mean
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
now
for
any
plaintiff
to
argue
that
any
conceivable
influence
district
must
be
drawn.
that
goes
entirely
against
the
central
theme
of
georgia
against
ashcroft,
which
is
that
states
have
flexibility
in
choosing
a
representational
model
for
voters
in
that
state.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
might
perhaps
be
true
if
the
plaintiffs
could
demonstrate
the
other
gingles
prongs,
but
on
the
second
and
third
prong,
the
district
court
found
that
african
american
voter
cohesion
was
far
from
clear
and
there
was
absolutely
no
cohesion
between
african
americans
and
hispanics
in
district
24.
indeed,
they
voted
in
an
almost
completely
polar
manner
in
democratic
primaries.
and
third,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
not
anglo
bloc
voting.
and
so
all
three
of
the
prongs...
what
the
district
court
found
as
a
factual
matter
is
that
district
24
functioned
as
an
anglo
democratic
district.
and
indeed,
this
case
is
unusual
in
that
there
were
some
extraordinary
direct
testimony
that
the
way
district
24
operates
is
not
accidental,
that
in
1991,
it
was
explicitly
drawn
by
anglo
democrats
for
the
specific
purpose
of
electing
anglo
democrats
and
only
anglo
democrats.
and
that
was
testimony
not
from
a
state
witness
but
from
congresswoman
eddie
bernice
johnson,
a
democratic
african
american
incumbent
from
the
adjoining
district
who
was
in
the
state
legislature
in
1991,
and
she
said
the
african
american
population
there
was
deliberately
split
up
to
create
a
district
that
would
be...
elect
white
democrats.
that
direct
testimony
is
extraordinary
and
it
shows
that
what
the
data
demonstrate,
which
is
that
white
democrats
control
the
district...
and
that's
what
the
district
court
found
as
a
factual
matter...
is
not
an
accident.
it
was
precisely
the
intended
effect
of
the
map-drawers.
indeed,
if
one
looks
to
the
three
races
that
the
appellants'
experts
examined
that
were
african
american
versus
anglo
in
the
primaries,
of
those
three
races,
an
african
american
candidate
of
choice
who
was
black
prevailed
in
only
one.
of
the
20
races
appellants'
experts
examined,
of
those
20,
only
one
black
candidate
prevailed,
and
that
case,
the
district
court
found,
was
aberrational
because
that
candidate
was
ron
kirk.
he
was
a
former
mayor
of
the
city
of
dallas.
he
was
a
very
popular,
local
politician
with
a
strong
friends
and
neighbors
effect.
if
you
take
that
aberrational
case
out,
the
two
other
cases
appellants'
experts
looked
to
both
showed
that
the
african
american
candidate,
one
of
whom
was
supported
by
76
percent
of
african
american
voters,
lost.
and
indeed,
what
happened
was
the
anglos
and
the
hispanics
voted
in
virtual
unison
against
the
african
american
candidate.
that
data...
if
one
looks
to
the
endogenous
races,
there
had
never
been
an
african
american
opponent
to
martin
frost,
or
the
exogenous
races,
those
three
we
talked
about...
the
data
demonstrate
quite
persuasively
that
african
americans
were
drawn
into
a
district
where
they
did
not
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
elect
their
candidate
of
choice
because
they
lacked
the
ability
to
elect
a
black
candidate.
now,
they
could
choose
to
do
otherwise,
but
in
this
district,
they
could
not
choose
to
elect
a
black
candidate.
and
that
was
the
district
court's
finding
and
that's
what
the
data
demonstrated.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
district
court
made
a
finding
that
the
reason
district
23
was
altered
was
to
increase
the
chances
of
congressman
bonilla
prevailing.
and
in
particular,
if
one
looks
to
webb
county,
which
is
the
county
that
was
split,
webb
county
centers
on
the
city
of
laredo.
and
in
2002...
the
race
that
the
gi
forum
appellants
focus
on
principally...
the
candidate
that
ran
against
congressman
bonilla
was
henry
cuellar,
a
popular,
local
politician
from
laredo,
and
he
had
a
very
strong
following
in
laredo.
and
as
a
consequence,
mr.
cuellar
did
very
well
in
that
election,
came
within
slightly
under
4
points
of
beating
mr.
bonilla
and
mr.
bonilla's
percentage
of
the...
of
the
latino
vote
dropped
to
its
lowest
historic
point.
that,
as
the
district
court
found,
was
also
aberrational
because
of
mr.
cuellar's
very
strong
local
support,
and
the
clearest
evidence
of
that
is
under
the
new
map,
when
half
of
webb
county
was
placed
in
the
adjoining
district,
district
28,
mr.
cuellar
ran
against
the
incumbent
democratic
congressman,
ciro
rodriguez,
and
beat
him
in
the
primary,
which
demonstrates
that
his
success
was
because
the...
the
voters
in
laredo
are
supporters
of
mr.
cuellar
and,
accordingly,
voted
for
him
against
either
opponent,
henry
bonilla
or
mr.
rodriguez.
and
so,
when
the
legislature
was
determining
which
section
of
voters
to
remove
for
political
reasons,
the
region
that
voted
heavily
against
mr.
bonilla
in
the
preceding
election,
laredo,
webb
county,
was
a
natural
place
to
move
voters
who
had
in
the
last
election
demonstrated
they
would
vote
for
his
opponent.
under
any
assessment
of
23,
the
prior
map
had
five
districts
that
were
indisputably
hispanic
opportunity
districts,
plus
district
23
that
elected
congressman
bonilla,
an
hispanic
republican.
the
current
map
has
six
districts
that
are
indisputably
hispanic
opportunity
districts,
plus
district
23
which
elects
henry
bonilla.
so
the
result
is
the
same
in
district
23,
and
there
is
an
additional
hispanic
opportunity
district
in
district
25.
if
i
may
turn
to
district
25
and
return
to
justice
kennedy's
questions
earlier
about
racial
gerrymandering
with
respect
to
that
district.
the
first
indicium
this
court
has
looked
to
in
racial
gerrymandering
case...
cases
is
unusual
or
bizarre
shape,
and
on
that
indicium,
this
district
does
not
fall
anywhere
near
the
districts
this
court
has
struck
down
as
racial
gerrymanders.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but
those
counties
have
to
be
placed
in
some
district.
and...
and
so
the
appellants
call
a
series
of
seven
whole
contiguous
counties
a
land
bridge,
but
those
are
very
sparsely
populated
counties.
in
whatever
district
they're
in,
they're
going
to
have
to
connect
with
a
population
zone.
and
what
the
district
court
found
as
a
factual
matter
is
that
the
elongated
nature...
the
relatively
elongated
nature
of
district
25
was
a
function
of
the
geography
and
the
fact
that
you
have
population
along
the
border
and
then
you
have
a
large
space
of
relatively
low
population,
and
then
you
have
to
get
back
up
to
population.
so
texas
historically
has
run
north-south
districts
to
get
enough
population
to
form
a
congressional
district
under
this
court's
one
person/one
vote
precedents.
district
25,
if
one
examines...
the
district
court
expressly
found
that
the
plaintiffs
failed
to
prove
purposeful
discrimination.
the
state
defendants
introduced
at
trial
a
cromartie
analysis
that
was
precisely
drawn
from
this
court's
first
cromartie
decision,
hunt
v.
cromartie,
and
it's
found
on
pages
331
and
332
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
what
that
analysis
did
is
precisely
what
this
court
found
in
cromartie
i
was
sufficient
on
summary
judgment
to
defeat
a
claim
of
racial
gerrymandering.
it
assessed
the
lines
in
travis
county,
the
northern
part
of
district
25,
and
it
asked
are
the
cuts
the
legislature
made
driven
by
politics
or
driven
by
race.
and
so
what
the
state's
expert
did
is
drew
a
map
that
would
be
based
on
race
that
would
maximize
the
hispanics
in
district
25
on
the
northern
end
of
travis
county.
he
then
compared
that
map
to
the
map
that
the
legislature
had
drawn
and
said
what
are
the
differences
between
what
it
would
look
like
if
the
legislature
was
attempting
to
maximize
race
as
compared
to
what
it
would
look
like
if
it
was
attempting
to
maximize
party.
and
what
the
state's
expert
found
is
there
was
on
the
order
of
a
1
percent
differential
which
is
you're
talking
between
24
and
25
percent.
so
it
was
about
4
percent
differential
of
fewer
hispanics
in
the
state's
map
and
more
democrats
in
the
state's
map.
and
so
what
the
state's
expert
found
is
precisely
along
the
lines
as
the
evidence
in
cromartie
i
that
the
legislature
had
drawn
the
map
looking
for
democrats
rather
than
looking
for
hispanics.
in
addition,
if
one
examines
the
two
numerical
measures
of
compactness,
smallest
circle
and
perimeter
to
area,
smallest
circle
this
map
measured
8.5,
which
is
smaller
than
north
carolina's
reconfigured
district
12
upheld
in
cromartie,
which
was
8.6
its
perimeter-to-area
score,
9.5,
is
terribly
low.
as
a...
as
a
means
of
comparison,
districts
18,
29,
and
30
that
this
court
struck
down
in
vera
had
perimeter-to-area
scores
of
106,
144,
and
69,
as
compared
to
district
25's
score
of
9.5.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
could
be
a
salutary
policy
goal,
and...
and
congress
could
certainly
enact
that.
but
i...
i
see
no...
no
source
in
the
constitution
placing
that
requirement
upon
states
particularly--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--at
an
extreme
level,
lack
of
compactness
can
indicate
something
was
going
on.
if
one
looks
at
the
districts
this
court
has
struck
down,
if
you
look
at
bush
v.
vera...
and
we
have
in
the
joint
appendix
the
silhouettes
of
those
districts
that
were...
you
know,
had
fingers
going
out
in
every
direction.
there's
plainly
something
questionable
going
on.
these
districts
are
nothing
like
that.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the...
the
new
map--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the...
the
new
map
was
somewhat
less
compact
than
the
prior
map,
but
it
does--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
lack
of
compactness
does
not...
no
one
has
brought
a
racial
gerrymandering
claim
with
respect
to
districts
other
than
25
and,
to
some
extent,
23,
although
the
23
challenge
is
not
a
typical
racial
gerrymandering
claim.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
understand
that,
although
a
majority
of
the
court
in
vieth
concluded
that
in
order
for
a
political
gerrymandering
claim
to
succeed,
that
there
must
be
a
substantive
standard
for
fairness
to
measure
the
map
against
some
baseline.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
the
court
had
before
it...
appellants
urged
in
vieth
compactness,
principles
of
cracking,
principles
of
packing.
one
of
the
dissenting
justices
advocated
that
standard,
and
yet,
a
majority
of
the
court...
the
plurality
explicitly
rejected
it.
and
justice
kennedy's
concurrence
explicitly
rejected
the
standards
discussed
in
the
dissents,
including
a
standard
looking
to
compactness.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
under
any
standard
that
looks
to
the
substantive
lines
on
the
map,
anything
that...
and
we
have
spent
hours
racking
our
brains
trying
to
think
of
a
standard
for
litigation
purposes
that
would
yield
the
old
map
being
more
fair
than
the
new
one.
we're
not
aware
of
any
coherent
standard
that
looks
to
substance.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
that...
that
question
actually
was
litigated
in
this
case,
the
first
time
in
2001,
as
part
of
the
litigation
over
how
to
draw
the
new
map.
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
presented
to
the
district
court
was
that
the
old
map
was
no
longer
consistent
with
how
texas
voters
were
voting.
and
the
district
court
concluded
that
under
the
upham
case,
it
lacked
the
authority
to
take
that
into
account
and
to
change
the
demonstrated
policy
preferences
of
the
last
legislative
map.
and
that's
why,
on
remand
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
although
it
didn't
intend
to
work
partisan
bias,
that
that
was
the
effect
of
its
map.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
in
this
case,
the
district
court
was
presented
with
maps
that
would
be
more
fair
on...
on
pretty
much
any
measure
of
partisanship,
and
what
the
district
court
concluded
is
it
didn't
have
the
ability...
that
making
that
judgment
was
a
political
judgment,
and
it
was
the
legislature's
job
to
do
it.
and
so
it
drew
in
the
districts
it
was
required
to
draw
because
texas
had
two
new
districts.
it
drew
in
what
it
believed
the
voting
rights
act
required,
and
beyond
that,
it
made
as
few
changes
as
possible.
and
so
the
district
court
recognized
that
the
consequence
of
that
map-drawing
technique
is
whatever
partisan
bias
was
there
before
is
reflected
in
its
own
map
that
just
neutrally
carries
over
the
preexisting
bias.
and
that's
why
the
district
court
found
it
was
perpetuating
the
prior
bias,
not
because
it
intended
to
do
so,
but
because
it
was
consciously
restraining
itself
from
doing
anything
to
alter
the
partisan
composition
other
than
to
carry
over
what
was
already
there.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
breyer,
that's...
that's
exactly
correct--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well,
although
we
would
submit
this
district
is
reasonably
compact.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
breyer,
you're
correct
that
if
the
court
concludes
this
district
is
not
reasonably
compact,
then
under
its
precedents,
it
wouldn't
be
a
narrowly
tailored
way
to
satisfy
a
voting
rights
violation,
but--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well,
the
district
court's
finding
was
that
texas
geography
and
population
dispersion
limit
the
availability
of
district
compactness
in
southern
and
western
regions
of
the
state,
and
that
was
at
the
jackson
jurisdictional
statement,
page
154a.
so
that's...
there's...
there's
a
challenge
in
texas
because
you've
got
these--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--25,
yes.
yes,
we're
talking
about
25.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
25
has
seven
whole
counties
and
only
two
county
splits,
which
is
unusual.
most
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
struck
down
what
it's
perceived
to
be
racial
gerrymanders
have
been
a
number
of
county
splits.
in
this
case,
the
county
splits...
those
were
mandated
to...
because
we
have
achieve
perfect
equipopulosity,
so
we
had
to
get
exactly,
within
one
person,
precise
lines.
but
within...
in
between
the
two,
they
are
whole
contiguous
counties
that
are
longstanding
geographic
units.
the
testimony
is
clear
that
the...
the
legislature
made
no
effort
to
avoid
anglo
voters.
it's
not
like
they
snaked
around.
and
even
the
lean
of
it
is
a
simple
fact
that
the
gulf
of
mexico
leans
like
this,
and
it
follows
the
geographic
boundaries
of
the
state,
so
that
if
one
examines
this
district
next
to
the
other
districts,
it
follows
historic
lines
that
have
been
used
in
texas.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
one
could
certainly
compare
the
preceding
district,
and
with
respect
to
the
preceding
district,
the
differential
is...
is
not
great.
it
is
somewhat
more
compact.
but
there
were
other
policy
agendas
the
district
court--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that...
that
is
a
certainly
a
challenge.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
you
know,
if
you
compare,
for
example,
district
25's
perimeter-to-area
score
is
9.6.
you
know,
if...
if
one
looks
at,
for
example,
the
plan
1385
submitted
by
gi
forum,
that
has
one
plan,
district...
one
district,
district
28,
with
a
higher
perimeter-to-area
score
of...
of
10.0.
and
indeed,
the
district
court
found
as
a
factual
matter
that
the
demonstration
plan
submitted
by
the
gi
forum
appellants
was...
was
less
compact
and
critically
would
not
perform.
going
back
to
the
section
2
question
about
district
23,
the
district
court
found
that
one
district
in
the
demonstration
plan,
district
28,
had
only
a
bare
majority
of
citizen
voting
population,
50.3
percent,
and
there
was
undisputed
testimony
that
for
a
district
to
perform
in
this
region,
it
had
to
have--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--because
the
hispanic
population
is
dispersed
enough
that
one
can't...
one
can't
draw--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we
did
not
ascribe
motives
to
them.
they...
they
drew
it
to
demonstrate
that...
that
you
could
draw
a
district
with
a
bare
majority
citizen
voting
population,
although
their
experts
also
testified
that
a
bare
majority
will
not
elect
in
this
region
because
of
lower
voter...
voter
turnouts.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
correct,
but
with
respect
to
the
question
of
racial
gerrymandering,
this
court's
question
is,
is
race
the
predominant
motivation?
there's
a
direct
factual
finding
by
the
district
court
that
it
was
not.
indeed,
the
district
court
said
that
the...
that
the
measures
of
compactness,
examined
in
relationship
to
the
geography
and
population,
reflect
the
sheer
size
and
population
distribution
of
this
area,
rather
than
a
calculated
stretch
to
find
voters
of
a
particular
ethnic
makeup.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it
is
a
function
of
the
population
in
south
and
west
texas.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the...
it
is
not
accidental
in
the
sense
that
the
legislature
was
unaware,
and
as
this
court
has
said,
whenever
a
legislature
is
districting,
it
is
aware
of
the...
the
racial
distribution.
but
it
was
drawing
an
additional
district
there,
and
the
district
court
found
that
in
drawing
those
lines,
it
did
not
reach
out
to
segregate
voters
on
either
side
based
on
race,
that
that
was
not
its
intent
and
that
was
not
the
effect
of
what
it
in
fact
drew.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
that...
that
concerns
district
23,
and...
and--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--no.
district
25
is...
has
a...
a
large
majority
on
hispanic
voting
age
population
and
also
citizen
voting
age
population.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
with
respect
to
district
23,
there's
an
unusual
aspect
to
the
gi
forum
appellants'
arguments
in
that
it's
unlike
a
typical
racial
gerrymandering
claim
where
they
say
you're...
you're
seeking
to
draw
lines
based
on
race.
she's
arguing
they
should
have
been
more
aggressive
drawing
lines
on...
based
on
race,
which
is...
which
is
not
an
argument
that
sounds
in
the
shaw
line
of
cases.
what
the
district
court
found
is
that
it
was
purely
a
political
motivation
that
drew
that
decision,
and
if
one
is
looking
to
the
voting
rights
act,
under
any
assessment,
the
district
is
performing
identically
as
it
did
before.
and
on
the
totality
of
circumstances,
either
based
on
the
region,
in
which
case
their
argument...
argument
is
one
for
maximization...
they
have
six
of
seven
districts.
they're
arguing
they're
entitled
to
seven
of
seven
districts...
or
on
a
statewide
basis,
the
district
court
found
totality
of
the
circumstances
was
met.
with
respect
to
district
24,
the
findings...
the...
two
of
the
three
findings,
with
respect
to
anglo
bloc
voting
and
cohesion,
the
appellants
have
made
no
attempt
to
get
around
other
than
in
their
reply
brief,
they
have...
have
briefly
challenged
them.
but
it
was
their
own
expert
who
provided
the
information
that
the
district
court
found
credible,
that
there
was
no
cohesion,
that
african
americans
couldn't
elect
their
candidate
of
choice.
and
it
is
undisputed
that
in
new
district
9,
african
americans
can
elect
their
candidate
of
choice.
and
so
from
a
statewide...
from
a
totality
of
circumstances
perspective,
the
ability
to
elect
a
candidate
of
choice
for
african
americans
in
the
state
is
higher
under
this
map
than
it
was
in
the
preceding
map.
in
sum,
the
basic
question
here
is
whether
courts
or
legislatures
are
the
principal
decision-makers.
if
appellants'
proffered
rule
is
adopted,
it
removes
the
safety
valve
that
the
constitution
provided.
it
is
rarely
employed
because
it
is
rare
that
one
finds
a
plan
so
out
of
step
with
the
demonstrated
preferences
of
voters
for
a
decade.
we
are
aware
of
no
other
plan
that
allowed
a
minority
of
voters
who
never
crossed
the
44
percent
threshold
to
control
the
majority
of
the
delegation.
we're
aware
of
no
other
map
in
the
country.
and
so
if
there
is
a
standard
that
this
is
impermissible,
that
consequence
would
either
elevate
courts
above
legislatures,
contrary
to
the
constitutional
text
and
to
4
decades
of
this
court's
precedents,
or
that
looks
to
substance,
it
would
call
into
question
the
districts
and
a
hosts
of
other
districts
because
on
any
objective
measure,
the
districts
in
texas
are
fair
as
a
partisan
matter,
compared
to
the
other
states,
compared
to
the
predecessor
map,
compared
to
any
metric
that
one
applies.
indeed,
the
social
scientists
say,
based
on
the
seats/votes
curve,
that
given
that
republican
voters
are
currently
voting
at
roughly
60
percent
for
republican
candidates,
one
would
expect
a
higher
percentage
of
republican
candidates
elected
than...
than
what
this
map
is
yielding.
and
so
on
any
coherent
measure
of
a
substantive
measure
of
fairness,
this
map
should
survive.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
