justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
your
reason
was
that
in
bush
v.
vera,
the
court
said,
of
course,
they
can
use
race
to
prevent
retrogression.
of
course,
they
can,
but
if
they
do,
they
have
to
create
a
compact
majority
minority
district,
not
an
elongated
majority--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the...
that's
the
argument.
i
have
to
go
back
and
look
at
bush
v.
vera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
that's...
but
now,
in
fairness,
i
think
to
the
red
brief
argument...
you've
read
the
red
briefs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
they
are
filled
with
factual
information
that
in
their
opinion
shows
that
previously
the
democrats
had
gerrymandered
this
much
worse,
and
that
what...
this
was
an
effort
to
create
a
balance.
that's
what
their
view
is.
now,
i
want
to
know
really
precisely
what
is
your
response
to
that
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
do
i
look
to
in
the
record
to
verify
what
you
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
answer?
i
mean,
you've
read
the
briefs.
the
obvious
reply
to
that
is
there
are
many,
many
districts
in
the
united
states
where
african
american
voters
have
a
big
influence
on
the
democratic
primary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
lot.
and
there
are
a
lot
where
the
democrat
wins.
so
if
your
principle
is
accepted,
says
the
other
side,
that
means
that
any
district
that's
drawn
here
to
favor
the
democrats
can't
be
changed,
but
all
the
ones
that
favor
the
republicans
can
be
changed.
now,
if
that
argument
is
right,
it's
hard
for
me
to
accept,
but
that's
a
neutral
principle
of
constitutional
law.
so
i
want
to
see
what...
what
your
response
is
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
obviously
you're
not.
that's
why
i
would
like--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
to
say
what
specifically
the
answer
to
that
argument
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
i...
i
wrote
an
opinion,
as
you
know,
where
i
was
agreeing
with
you
on
that,
and
i
wonder
if...
if
then
the
thing
to
do
would
be
to
say,
yes,
indeed,
a
legislature
can
redraw
a
map
to
prevent
a
minority
of
the
voters
electing
a
majority
of
the
congressional
delegation.
but
when
they
do
that,
there
has
to
be
some
reasonable
assurance
that
it
works
the
same
way
for
both
parties.
i
mean
as
a
standard.
i
thought
my
standard
worked
before.
i
guess
there
wasn't
that
much
agreement,
but...
but--
[laughter]
--from
the
point
of
view
of...
of
taking
that
standard,
which
you
agree
with,
i'm
glad
to
say,
apparently,
and
modifying
it
to
be
sure
it
works
out
the
same
way
for
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
a...
i'd
like
you
to
elaborate
a
little
because,
as
i
understood
your
claim,
particularly
in
response
to
justice
stevens,
you
agree
that
if
23
violated
section
2,
they
can't
make
up
for
it
somewhere
else.
you
agree
they
can't
make
up
for
it
particularly
when
their
only
way
is
for
political
reasons.
but
your
argument
is
they
never
violated...
that
23
as
redrawn
didn't
violate
section
2.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
that
it
didn't
violate
section
2,
i
want
to
know,
is
what?
because
you
have
the
three
preconditions
which
seem
to
be
met,
and
then
you
have
some
kind
of...
it
doesn't
violate
section
2
from
de
grandy
if,
despite
the
preconditions,
there
is
some
kind
of
overall
proportionality.
but
all
that
is
rather
unclear
in
my
mind,
and
i
want
to
know
what
your
view
of
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
district
24.
i
take
it...
it's
a
long
walking
stick
is
what
it
looks
like.
and
the...
i
take
it
you're
saying
when
i
go
back
to
the
record
here,
i'll
discover
a
finding
that
the
district
court
made.
they
said
this
was
not
an
effort
to
use
race
to
district.
is
that
right?
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
you
think
that
is
because,
although
it's
not
a
circle,
it's
not
absolutely
terrible.
that...
that
is
a
supporter
of
the
ultimate
conclusion
they
did
not
use
race.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then...
then
if
i...
if
i...
so
i
have
to
go
back,
look
at
the
record,
and
see
what
it
says.
now,
suppose
i
came
to
a
different
conclusion.
then
you
might
still
win
on
this
point
if
the
rationale
for
using
race
to
district
was
because
we
want
to
avoid
a
section
2
violation.
and
there,
you
would
lose,
however,
because
you
can't
use
that
rationale
unless,
according
to
bush
v.
vera,
the
district
that
you
draw
is,
in
their
words,
reasonably
compact.
so,
again,
you'd
have
to
say
that
this
district
that
looks
like
a
walking
stick
is
reasonably
compact
for
that
other
purpose.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
so
i
understand
that.
but...
but
if...
if
i...
you
have
two
bites
at
this
apple
with
your
reasonably
compactness.
one,
you
want
to
say
it
wasn't...
you
think
this
proves
it
wasn't
to
use
race
in
the
first
place,
but
if
i'm
wrong
on
that,
it's
still
a
legitimate
use
of
race
because
it's
a
reasonably
compact
effort
to
conform
with
section
2.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
there
anything
i
can
look
to
to
decide
what
reasonably
compact
means
in
that
second--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
25.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the...
either
it
is
reasonably
compact
or
it
isn't.
if
it
is
reasonably
compact,
we
never
get
into
bush
v.
vera,
whatever,
the
vera
case
in
the
first
place.
and
if
it
isn't,
you
can't
get
out
of
it
by
saying
it's
an
effort
to
cure
a
section
2
violation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
possible
it
violates
section
2,
the
following?
we
look
at
the
map
as
it's
drawn.
we
ask
the
question,
is
there
a
way
to
redraw
this
map
so
that,
say,
the
minority
group
has
a
more
significant
influence
for
their
bloc
voting,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
gingles.
answer:
of
course,
there
is.
it's
the
old
way.
and
you
say,
well,
why
didn't
you
do
it
the
old
way?
well,
the
only
reason
you
didn't
do
it
the
old
way
was
pure
politics
and
that
that
isn't
a
sufficient
justification.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
thinking
of
district
23.
