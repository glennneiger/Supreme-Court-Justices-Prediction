ms.
nina
perales
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
begin
by
arguing
that
texas
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
by
making
excessive
use
of
race
in
its
changes
to
district
23.
after
removing
100,000
latinos
from
district
23,
the
state
used
race
to
craft
a
razor-thin
latino
majority.
abandoning
political
data,
the
state
used
census
block
redistricting
to
achieve
50.9
percent
latino
voting
age
population.
ms.
nina
perales
in
district
23,
your
honor.
thus,
the
state
used
race,
as
we
contend,
not
only
to
protect
an
incumbent,
but
to
give
the
false
impression
of
latino
support
for
that
incumbent.
ms.
nina
perales
yes,
justice
kennedy,
we
do
attack
that
finding
as
clearly
erroneous.
this
case
is
really
the
flip
side
of
easley
v.
cromartie
because
in
this
case
latino
voters
supported
republican
and
democratic
candidates.
as
the
state
asserts
vigorously,
latino
voters
voted
significantly
and
substantially--
ms.
nina
perales
--yes,
justice
stevens.
the...
the
test
under
section
2
is
results,
and
that
goes--
ms.
nina
perales
--yes,
and
we
argue
in
our
brief
exactly
that.
but
we
hope
today
to
focus
in
oral
argument
at
least
first
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
violation,
which
is
the
intentional
use
of
race
both
as
intentional
vote
dilution,
as
well
as
the
analytically
distinct
claim
under
shaw
v.
miller.
with
respect
to
the
question
whether
latino
voters
voted
with
such
a
high
correlation...
and
that's
the
phrase
used
from
easley
v.
cromartie...
whether
there
was
such
a
high
correlation
between
latino
voters
and
democratic
voters,
particularly
in
district
23,
to
justify
removing
them
because
of
their
race
and
then
saying
that
they
were
democrats,
that
nexus
simply
doesn't
exist
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
besides
the
state's
arguments
and...
and
the
many
assertions
that
it
makes
with
respect
to
latino
voting
support
for
republican
candidates
and
especially
congressman
bonilla,
we
also
have
latino
voting
for
bonilla
that
rises
and
falls.
if
latinos
were
close
adherents
to
the
democratic
ticket,
you
wouldn't
see
fluctuating
support
for
congressman
bonilla.
you
would
see
low
and
steady
support
if
latinos
were
democratic
voters.
instead,
we
see
something
very
different,
which
is
congressman
bonilla
gaining
support
in
the
latino
community
within
his
district
up
until
1996
where
the
peak
is
30
percent
latino
support
and
then
a
steady
decline
over
a
series
of
elections,
ending
in
2002
with
only
8
percent,
as
the
district
court
found,
latino
support
for
congressman
bonilla.
this
is
not--
ms.
nina
perales
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
under
section
2's
question
with
respect
to
racially
polarized
voting,
we
would
contend
that
voting
as
a
bloc
70
percent
or
subsequently
higher
than
70
percent
to
90-92
percent
is
enough
under
section
2
to
satisfy
the
test
whether
latinos
are
voting
cohesively.
congressman
bonilla
has
never
been
able
to
garner
a
majority
of
latino
support,
not
more
than
30
percent.
but
with
respect
to
a
somewhat
different
question,
which
is
whether
partisanship
and
race
correlate
so
highly
in
district
23,
that
you
can
remove
latinos
and
in
the
hopes
of
being
able
to
take
the
democratic
index
down,
we
say
that
that
kind
of
voting
is
not
tight
enough.
in
easley
v.
cromartie,
of
course,
the
court
found
that
african
american
voters
voted
95
to
97
percent
for
democratic
candidates
across
elections.
ms.
nina
perales
this
court
made
clear
in
bush
v.
vera
that
the
state
may
not
make
exactly
the
kind
of
assumption,
justice
scalia,
that
you
described.
the...
the
court
held
in
bush
v.
vera
that
you
cannot
use
race
as
a
proxy
for
partisanship.
you
cannot
make
that
assumption.
so
if
the
state--
ms.
nina
perales
--in
this
case,
we
contend
that
the
state
removed
latino
voters
from
district
23
because
they
were
latino
and
that--
ms.
nina
perales
--that
if
the
state--
ms.
nina
perales
--then
it
is
still
wrong
to
take
out
100,000
latinos
using
that
assumption.
i
mean,
the...
the
act
that
was
done
was
to
slice
through
the
most
latino
county
in
the
united
states,
95
percent
latino.
the
people
were
not
removed
anywhere
else.
clearly,
the
state
removed
latinos
from
this
district
and
then
said,
well,
we
did
it
because
we
were
aiming
for
democrats.
ms.
nina
perales
it's
wrong
under
both,
we
would
argue
in
our
brief.
ms.
nina
perales
we
contend
that
in
this
case
the
removal
is
invidious
because
it
was
latinos
that
were
identified
and
taken
out
and
then...
for
incumbency
protection,
similar
to
what--
ms.
nina
perales
--there's
no
testimony
that
the
state
considered
ever
taking
out
anybody
else
but
the
people
in
webb
county.
ms.
nina
perales
yes,
justice
scalia.
ms.
nina
perales
that's
exactly
our
point,
that
the
state
removed--
ms.
nina
perales
--moving
to
what
i...
the
point--
ms.
nina
perales
--i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
what
had
happened
by
2002
was
something
very,
very
different.
after
1996,
when
mr.
bonilla
garnered
the
high
of
30
percent
among
latino
voters,
not...
not
in
his
district
but
among
that
group--
ms.
nina
perales
--yes.
ms.
nina
perales
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
this
is
bloc
voting
at
rates
of
70
percent
or
higher,
and
after
1996,
that
70
percent
bloc
went
to
80
percent
and
then
it
went
to
90
percent.
and
as
the
voters
became
increasingly
disenchanted,
i
suppose,
with
the
incumbent,
that
decline
was
steady.
it
didn't
fluctuate
up
and
down.
it
was
going
down
and
it
went
down
even
farther.
mr.
bonilla
was
always
opposed
by
a
latino
candidate
in
each
of
his
general
elections
that
he's
had
since
he's
been
elected.
so
that
hasn't
really
been
a
factor
for
the
voters.
but
as
they
became
more
cohesive
and
they
reached
55
percent
of
the...
the
registration
in
the
district,
they
were
poised
to
elect
their
candidate
of
choice.
ms.
nina
perales
we
would
contend,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
voting
against
congressman
bonilla
doesn't
make
you
a
democrat.
and
it,
in
fact,
highlights
that
the
state
was
seeking
voters,
latino
voters,
who
had
withdrawn
their
support
for
congressman
bonilla
as
opposed
to
just
seeking
democrats
because
you
can
vote
against
congressman
bonilla
and
still
vote
republican
in
other
races,
as
latinos
did.
and
you
could
have
been
a
former
supporter
of
congressman
bonilla.
it
doesn't
make
you
a
democrat
in
that
sense
that
race
and
partisanship
are
completely
interchangeable
so
that
the
state
can
scoop
in
and
grab
100,000
people
of
the
same
race
and
then
say
later,
well,
we
were
taking
out
democrats.
ms.
nina
perales
we
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
end
goal
was
political
in
the
sense
of
incumbency
protection,
but
a
state
may
not
use
race
as
the
means
to
the
end
of
protecting
an
incumbent.
what
happened
here
was
that
the
only
group
of
voters
who
had
shifted
their
support
away
from
congressman
bonilla
were
latino.
democrats
had
never
voted
for
congressman
bonilla.
the
problem
inside
this
district
was
not
a
problem
of
democratic
voters.
it
was
latino
voters
who
had
supported
him
and
withdrawn.
ms.
nina
perales
it
should
turn
on
the
candidate
of
choice--
ms.
nina
perales
--well,
district
23
was
created
by
the
balderas
court
pursuant
to
a
finding
under
section
2.
so
it
was
a
remedial
district
under
section
2
when
it
was
created
in
2001.
and
in
2002,
when
it
was
used
as
a
remedial
district,
it...
it
elected
a
latino-preferred
candidate
in
13
out
of
15
elections,
according
to
the
state's
expert,
and
came
very
close
to
unseating
congressman
bonilla.
the
state's
response
was
essentially
to
punish
latino
voters
for
voting
against
congressman
bonilla
by
slicing
them
out
of
the
district.
so
the
state
used
race
to
achieve
its
end
of...
of
incumbency
protection.
ms.
nina
perales
because
the
group
of
voters
who
had
withdrawn
their
support
were
latino
voters.
the
district
court
discusses
the...
the
interrelationship
of
these
phenomenon
in
its
opinion
at
jurisdictional
statement
appendix
128
when
it
says,
the
state
acted
to
shore
up
the
incumbency
of
congressman
bonilla,
and
the
next
sentence
is,
his
support
among
latino
voters
had
dropped
to
8
percent.
it
was,
in
fact,
the...
the
voting
behavior
of
latinos
as
opposed
to
anybody
else
who
had
caused
the
incumbency
crisis,
and
it
was
latinos
as
latinos
who
were
removed
from
the
district.
at
the
same
time,
however,
the
redistricters
sat
down
and
figured
out
exactly
how
many
latinos
they
wanted
to
leave
inside
this
district
to
achieve
a
bare,
razor-thin
latino
voting
age
majority
population,
and
that
was
done
to
give
the
impression
of
latino
support
for
the
incumbent.
the
chief
redistricter--
ms.
nina
perales
--the
fourteenth
amendment,
mr.
chief
justice--
ms.
nina
perales
--this
court
has
held
that
race
may
not
be
used
for
its
own
sake
in
redistricting,
and
here
race
was
used
most
gratuitously
and
cynically
to
make
sure
that
the
state
could
say
a
majority
of
latinos
in
district
23
support
congressman
bonilla.
the
chief
redistricter
in
the
house,
representative
phil
king,
testified...
and
this
is
express
motivation...
that
they
sought
to
maintain
a
50
percent
latino
voting
age
majority
in
the
district
while
making
it
safer
for
congressman
bonilla,
which
involved
pulling
100,000
latinos
out.
similarly--
ms.
nina
perales
--oh,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but...
but
quite
a
distance.
the...
as
the
balderas
court--
ms.
nina
perales
--the
voting
age
population
for
district
23,
as
created
by
the
balderas
court,
your
honor,
was
a
great
deal
higher.
it
was
63
percent,
and
that
was
what
was
able
to
give
the
55
percent
voter
registration--
ms.
nina
perales
--we
would
argue
that
race
cannot
be
used
for
its
own
sake,
that
if
you're
going
to
put
people
together
into
a
latino
majority
district,
it
should
be
to
meet
a
purpose,
for
example,
to
create
an
opportunity
district
under
the
voting
rights
act.
ms.
nina
perales
that
would
be...
well,
depending
on
how
many
people
it
takes
in
that
particular
district
to
elect
a
candidate
of
choice.
in
this
case
it
was
63
percent.
it
might
be
a
different
number
for
a
different
district.
but
your--
ms.
nina
perales
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
nina
perales
maybe
i
can
answer
the
question
by
going
around
to
the
court's
finding,
which
was
that
district
23
was
created
not
as
a
latino
opportunity
district,
that
it
would
not
operate
to
offer
the
opportunity
to
elect
a
latino
for
a
candidate.
and
the...
and
the
district
court
found
this
on
page
145-146
of
our
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
and
in
that
same
paragraph,
they
said,
but
it
has
a
political
nuance
that
congressman
bonilla
will
be
elected
from
a
latino
majority
district.
ms.
nina
perales
that
number
would
be
the
number
that
shows
latinos
have
the
opportunity
to
elect
their
candidate
of
choice.
it
will
be
a
different
number
for
each
district,
but
it
would
always
be
in
the
evidence
of
the
case
because
the
analysis
is
done
on
different
districts.
here,
all
of
the
experts
agreed
that
district
23
had
been
created
so
that
it
would
not
elect
a
latino
candidate
of
choice,
but
that
the
state
testified
that
it
wanted
to
keep
it
voting
age
majority,
that
they
did
so
because
they
wanted
henry
bonilla
to
run
from
a
latino
majority
district.
the
state
abandoned
traditional
redistricting
criteria
to
do
so,
redistricting
at
the
bloc
level
and
splitting
6
election
precincts
out
of
51
in
webb
county,
which
is
wholly
unnecessary
even
to
equalize
population
in
either
district.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
state--
ms.
nina
perales
--to
have
done
that.
ms.
nina
perales
well,
the
state
certainly
could
have
moved
webb
county
whole
out
of
the
district.
it
depends
on
how
they
would
have
done
the
overall--
ms.
nina
perales
--mr.
chief
justice,
it...
it
just
doesn't
hang
on
a
particular
number.
it...
it
turns
on
whether
or
not
the
district
is
an
opportunity
district,
and
if
it
isn't
an
opportunity
district,
why
is
the
state
sitting
down
and
using
race
for
its
own
sake
to
be
able
to
say
we
got
50.9
percent
latino
voting
age
population?
we
managed
to
zigzag
that
boundary
through
the
streets
and...
and
through
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
of
laredo
so
that
we
could
say
it
was
a
latino
majority
district.
ms.
nina
perales
well,
under
section
5,
the
state
went
ahead
and
created
district
25
as
the
offset
because
it
seemed
fairly
clear
that
district
23
had
been
dismantled
to
such
a
degree
it
was
no
longer
going
to
be
able
to
be
used
for
section
5
purposes.
similarly,
under
section
2,
the
state
saw
that
it
was
terribly
vulnerable
and
so
again
tried
to
make
an
offset
district
which
caused
its
own
problems.
so
the
use
of
race
here
to
achieve
the
50.9
percent
voting
age
majority
was
not
to
satisfy
the
voting
rights
act,
either
section
5
or
section
2.
ms.
nina
perales
to
create
a
district
with
50.9
percent
voting
age
population
here
in
this
part
of
the
state,
it
would
be
obvious
that
you
weren't
going
to
yield
an
opportunity
district.
ms.
nina
perales
yes.
ms.
nina
perales
yes,
most
certainly.
this
case
represents
an
egregious
use
of
race
in
redistricting.
without
the
equal
protection
clause
to
protect
minority
voters,
states
will
have
free
rein
to
use
race
to
manipulate
not
only
electoral
outcomes,
as
it
did
here,
but
also
the
complexion
of
a
district
in
order
to
be
able
to
express
some
kind
of
symbolic--
ms.
nina
perales
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
serve
a
compelling
state
interest,
to
comply
with
the
voting
rights
act,
yes,
justice
scalia,
it
is
appropriate.
it
was
not
appropriate
here.
