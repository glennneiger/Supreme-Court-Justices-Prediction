justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask?
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
the...
the
questioning.
doesn't
everyone
agree
that
the
predominant
motive
in
all
the
districts
was
political?
you
agree
to
that,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
agree
that
that
necessarily
makes
it
valid,
that
that's
necessarily
a
defense
to
section
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
the
problem
with
section...
with
district
23,
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act,
is
not
the
motivation.
it's
the
results
that
have
changed.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
under
the
district
court's
opinion
is
whether
the
political
motive
was
an
adequate
defense
to
what
would
otherwise
be
a
violation
of
section
2.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do
that,
may
i
just
ask
one
short
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you've
mainly
attacked
the
plan
as
a
whole
in
your
briefs.
and
i'm
wondering.
i
often
look
at
particular
districts,
as
you
may
know.
are
there
residents
of
districts
23,
district
24
that
are
plaintiffs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
not
identified
easily--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
just
with
one...
one
question
on
district
23?
regardless
of
what
the
intent
of
the
parties
was,
i'm
just
wondering
why
is
the
district
court's
finding
on
intent
relevant
to
the
section
2
issue
when
the
test
under
section
2
is
results?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
even
if
the
intent
was
primarily
political,
it
would
still
violate
section
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask,
general
cruz,
are
you
talking
about
replacing
the
court-ordered
map
or
the
preceding
democrat
gerrymandered
map?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
don't
think
it
really
perpetuated
the
same
degree
of
gerrymandering
that
was
present
in
the
earlier
map,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
did?
do
you
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
court-ordered
map
is
just
as
bad
as
the
democratic
map?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
your
opponent
correct
in
saying
that
in
six
of
those
districts,
the
democrat
won
even
though
the
district
was
majority
republican?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
sound
like
a
gerrymander?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
assume
you're
correct
that
as
a
whole
the
plan
is
well-justified
and
makes
gains
and
so
forth.
does
that
necessarily
mean
that
every
district
within
the...
the
plan
is
immune
from
constitutional
attack?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the...
the
next
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is
that
if
it
is
possible
there
can
be
a
single-district
challenge,
what
is
the
justification
for
the...
the
cracking
of
district
24,
which
was
a
majority
democratic
district
before,
into
five
different
districts,
none
of
which
would
elect
a
democrat.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it...
is
it
defended
by
anything
other
than
political
motivation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
in
district
24.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
cruz,
could
i
ask
you
another
district-specific
question?
because
i
want
to
get
it
on
the
table
and
let
you
explain
it
to
me.
focusing
on
district
23
for
a
moment,
assuming
for
the
moment...
and
i...
i
know
you
probably
disagree
with
this
but...
that
the
results
of
the
redrawing
of
district
23
violated
section
2,
would
you
say
that
it
would
be
a
defense
to
that
violation
that
the
motivation
was
actually
non-racial
but
purely
political?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
a
defense.
and
the
second
question
for
me
is
that
if
there
were
a
violation
in
district
23
of
section
2,
could
it
be
cured
by
creating
a
district...
the
district
farther
to
the
east.
i
forget
the
number.
25
i
guess
it
was.
would
that
be
a
cure
in
your...
in
your
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
given
what
the
court
said
in
shaw
ii.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
for
the
fact
the
district
court
really
didn't
find
a
violation
in
section
2.
they
didn't
quite,
as
i'm
suggesting,
say,
well,
given
a
violation
on
section
2,
can
we
cure
it
and
have
a
defense
by
what
we
do
in...
in
district
25.
and
i
don't
think
de
grandy
is
an
answer
to
that,
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
whether
you
said
yes
or
no
on
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
argument...
the
question
then
would
be
whether
district
25
is
a
wholly
different
area
from
district
23.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
that
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
decision
to
reshape
the
district?
why
did
they
do
it
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
cruz,
if
you've
finished
your
answer...
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
you,
but
that
makes...
reminds
me
of
a
question
i
wanted
to
answer
you
because...
ask
you,
rather,
because
you
make
a
very
persuasive
argument
in
your
brief,
which
i
found
very
helpful,
that
the...
a
state
should
be
able
to
correct
a
prior
gerrymander
by...
for...
with
political
motivations.
i
would
like
you
to
comment
on
this
suggestion.
supposing
we
said
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
do
that
with
one
caveat,
that
any
new
district
has
to
be
more
compact...
no
more...
no
less
compact
than
its
predecessor,
wouldn't
that
avoid
all
sorts
of
problems?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have...
we
have
quite
a
history,
as
you
just
identified
in
your
response
to
justice
kennedy,
of
being
concerned
about
particularly
grotesque
shapes,
and
that's
why
they
developed
these
tests
of
compactness
for
use
in
this
very
litigation.
and
the
fact
that
the
lawyers
have
come
up
with
this
approach
to
it
makes
me
think
maybe
it
does
have
some
relevance
to
the
whole
problem
we're
trying
to
confront.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
i...
when
i
was
thinking
about
this
problem,
i
looked
at
district
24.
the
thing
that
was
interesting
to
me
is
that
most
of
the
neutral
justifications
that
you
describe...
and
they're
certainly
in
the...
in
the
five
new
districts
that
replaced
it,
but
in
the
key
part
of
the
population
that
was
moved,
it
becomes
much
less
compact
than
it
was
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
it
seems
to
me
quite
significant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
its
particularly...
particular
reference
to
the
targeted
group
that
was
moved
out
of
the
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
suggesting
the
challenge
to
24
should
be
a
political
gerrymandering
challenge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
the
standard
i'm
suggesting.
right.
that's
exactly
the
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
was
suggesting
that
would
be
a
safe
harbor,
and...
and
it
would
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--general
cruz,
why
wouldn't
it
be
a...
at
least
a
helpful
guide
to
what
is
reasonably
compact
to
compare
with
the
preceding
districts?
now,
that
fits
24
but
not
necessarily
25
i
understand.
wouldn't
that
make...
make
sense
if
the
reasonable
compactness
is...
is
one
of
the
tests?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
if
you
have
a
plaintiff
suing,
it
would
be
the
one
he
lives
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
agree
with
general
cruz,
that
if
the
results
of
the
20...
section...
district
23
violated
section
2,
it
would
not
be
a
defense
that
was
politically
motivated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
you
also
agree
with
the
second
question
i
asked
as
to
whether
if
it
were
a
violation...
i
understand
you
don't
think
it
was...
it
would
not
be
a
defense
that
they
were
able
to
create
a
district...
a
hispanic
district
in
another
part
of
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
based
on
the
premise
that
section...
that
district
25
and
district
23
are
in
the
same
part
of
the
state?
