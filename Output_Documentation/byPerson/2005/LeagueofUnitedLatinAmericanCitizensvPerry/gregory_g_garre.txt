mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states'
participation
in
this
case
is
addressed
to
the
voting
rights
act
issues,
and
our
position
is
that
the
district
court
properly
concluded
that
the
2003
plan
does
not
unlawfully
dilute
minority
voting
strength
in
either
the
dallas/fort
worth
area
or
the
south
and
west
region
of
the
state.
the
district
court
based
that
conclusion
on
factual
findings
that
are
entitled
to
great
respect
on
appeal
and
that
preclude
appellants'
section
2
claims
under
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i...
i
think
that's
right,
justice
stevens,
insofar
as--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that's
true
in
the
context
that
the
court
said
it
in
the
shaw
ii
case,
but
we
don't
think
that
the
principle
of
shaw
ii
would
apply
to
the
section
2
claim
in
the
south
and
west
part
of
texas
in
this
case.
and
that's
because
in
shaw
ii,
the
court
found
a
violation
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
and
considered
the
question
as
to
whether
a
creation
of
a
district
in
a
completely
different
part
of
the
state,
the
middle
of
the
state
with
no
connection,
would
remedy
the
section
2
violation,
and
the
court
said
no.
this
case
deals
with
a
section
2
claim
which
is
addressed
to
a
particular
region
of
the
state,
a
region
that's
marked
by
its
high
concentration
of
hispanic
citizen
voting
age
population,
as
well
as
common
geography
and
other
factors.
and
we
know
that
the
claim
is
addressed
to
that
particular
region
of
the
state
because
that...
that
region
is
the
focus
of
the
plaintiffs'
demonstration
plan.
mr.
cruz
referred
to
it.
it's
at
page
241
of
the
gi
forum
jurisdictional
statement.
that's
the
plan
that
they
claim
they're
entitled
to
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act,
and
it's
addressed
to
the
entire
part
of
the
state.
so
in
that
situation
where
you've
got
a
claim
where
you
have
a...
a
voting
rights
act
section
2
claim
addressed
to
a
particular
region
of
the
state,
we
don't
think
that
the
shaw
ii
principle
would
come
into
play.
here,
we
don't
think
there's
any
section
2
violation
with
respect
to
the
elimination
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
not
just
the
same
part
of
the
state,
but
a
part
of
the
state
that
falls
within
the
section
2...
within
the
focus
of
the
plaintiffs'
section
2
claim,
and
a
part
of
the
state
that's
marked
by
its
high
concentration
of
minority
citizen
voting
age
population.
in...
in
the
de
grandy
case,
this
court
confronted
a
very
similar
problem
where
you
had
one
part
of
the
state,
the
miami-dade
area
of
florida,
which
had
a
high
concentration
of
hispanic
citizen
voting
age
population,
and
the
state
was
drawing
various
districts
in
that
part
of
the
state.
and
the
court
looked
to
those
districts
and
considered
whether
there
was
a
proportional
representation
of
the
minority
group
in
that
area
and...
and
found
that,
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
there
was,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
violation
of
section
2.
here,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
district
court
found
that
the
citizen
voting
age
population
in
the
south
and
west
part
of
the
state
was
58
percent,
and
that
under
the
state's
plan,
hispanics
enjoyed
85
percent
majority
minority
districts
in
that
area,
which
is
to
say,
six
of
the
seven
districts
under
the
state's
plans
were
districts
in
which
hispanics
enjoyed
a
majority
of
the
citizen
voting
age
population.
the
decision
within
that
area
of
where
to
draw
district
lines
is
a
decision
that
section
2
and
this
court's
precedents
leave
up
to
the
states.
and,
in
fact,
in
the
de
grandy
case,
this
court
in...
in
particular
considered
the
situation
where
a
district
line
ran
through
a
minority
neighborhood
and
split
up
that
neighborhood.
the
court
discussed
it
on
page
1015
of
its
decision.
and
it
said
that
the
fact
that
the
district
line
went
through
that
neighborhood
and
had
an
effect
on
minority
voters,
in
terms
of
which
district
they
went
into,
didn't
in
itself
establish
a
section
2
violation.
and
we
think
the
same
principle
would
apply
here,
where
the
fact
that
the
district
lines
separating
district
23
and
28
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
near
laredo
splits
a
hispanic
neighborhood,
which
is,
after
all,
not...
not
surprising
given
that
the
large
percentage
of
the
population
in
that
part
of
the
state
is
hispanic,
doesn't
in
itself
establish
a
section
2
violation.
the
plaintiffs'
section
2
claim
in
that
part
of
the
state
really
sounds
very
much
in
a
section
5
retrogression
or
dismantling
claim,
and
this
court
made
clear
in
the
holder
v.
hall
case
that
retrogression
principles
of
section
5
are
not
applicable
in
section
2
cases.
and
we
certainly
think
that
that
principle
holds
here
and
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
don't
know
of
a--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--specific
case
that
has
addressed
that
concern.
i
suppose
it
would
go
perhaps
to
the
cohesiveness
analysis
under
the
gingles
factors.
i
mean,
what...
what
is
clear
under
this
court's
cases
and
the
text
of
section
2(b)
is
that
the
court
has
to
take
into
account
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
the
area,
not
just
the
rough
proportion...
the
existence
of
proportionality
between
the
hispanic
population
and
the
number
of
districts
in
which
they
enjoy
a
majority,
but
all
the
circumstances
that
could
bear
on
the
region.
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
conducted
that
analysis
and
it
found,
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
that
there
was
an...
that
there
was
not
a
section
2
violation
in
the
south
and
west
region
of
the
state.
and
we
certainly
think
that
that
finding
is
entitled
to
respect
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
that
this
court
applies
in
reviewing
findings...
ultimate
findings
of
vote
dilution.
the
court
has...
has
said
repeatedly
that
it
will
not
disturb
such
a
factual
finding
unless
it
is
left
with
the
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
made,
and
we
don't
think
the
record
in
this
case
would
support
such
a
conclusion
with
respect
to
either
the
section
2
claim
in
the
south
and
west
or
the
section
2
claim
in
the
dallas/fort
worth
area.
as
we
have
explained
in
our
brief,
that
claim...
and
i'm
now
turning
to
the
dallas/fort
worth
claim...
fails
because
of
the
district
court's
finding
that
african
american
voters
in
old
congressional
district
24
lacked
the
ability
to
elect
candidates
of
choice
in
that
district
in
the
sense
that
they
would
be
unable,
in
a
contested
election,
to
put
their
candidate,
the
african
american
candidate,
into
office.
that
finding
too
is
supported
by
ample
record
evidence
and
we
think
could
not
be
set
aside
under
the
standard
that
this
court
applies.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
don't
think
that
would
bear
on
the
typical
section
2
analysis
that
this
court
would
apply.
the...
the
plaintiffs
bear
the
burden
of
coming
in
in
a
section
2
case,
which
is,
after
all,
a
claim
that
the
state
is
forced
to
draw
a
district
in
a
particular
way,
to
show
the
demonstration
district
in
which
the
three
gingles
factors
can
be
met.
and
this
case
is
a
little
bit
unusual
in
that
instead
of
coming
up
with
a...
a
new
district,
they've
just
pointed
to
the
old
district,
which
in
itself
is...
is
similar
to
more
of
a
section
5
claim.
but
with
respect
to
that
district,
the
district
court
failed...
failed
to...
the
district
court
found
that
plaintiffs
failed
to
meet
the
first
gingles
precondition,
which
is
that
they
could
not
show
in
that
district
that
they
had
the
ability
to
elect
the
candidate
of
their
choice
because
african
americans
were
22
percent
of
the
population
in
that
district,
the
third
largest
racial
group,
and
because
other
evidence,
including
the
past
elections
in
that
district
and
direct
testimony
of
politicians
with
intimate
familiarity
of
that
district,
supported
the
logical
conclusion
that
a
group
that
comprises
only
22
percent
of
the
electorate--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
with
respect
to
district
23,
again
i...
i
think
the...
the
framework
for
the
plaintiffs'
challenge
to
section
23
is
the
south
and
west
region
of
the
state
in
a
claim
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
seventh...
a
seventh
effective
majority
district
in
that
part
of
the
state.
the
state's
plan,
2003
plan,
gives
them
six
majority
minority
districts.
the
plaintiffs,
gi
forum--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
including
23.
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
claim
that
they're
entitled
to
a
seventh
majority
minority
district.
the
district
court
rejected
that
claim
because
it
found
that
they
had
failed
to
show
that
the
seventh
district
that
they
drew
would
be
an
effective
district
because
it
only
had
50.3
percent
citizen
voting
age
population--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
gi
forum
drew.
that's
right.
and
again,
that's
at
page
241
of
the
gi
forum
jurisdictional
statement.
it
found
that
that
district
was
not
effective
because
it
only
had
a
50.3
percent
citizen
voting
age
population,
and
the
district
court
found,
based
on
the
testimony
that
showed
that
hispanics
have
a
comparatively
low
turnout
rate
in
elections,
that
a
50.3
percentage
wouldn't
do
the
trick
to
give
them
the
potential
to
elect.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you.
