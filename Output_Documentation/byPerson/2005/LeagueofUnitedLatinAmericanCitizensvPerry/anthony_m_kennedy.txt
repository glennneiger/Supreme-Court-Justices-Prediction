justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what's
the...
i'm...
as
justice
scalia,
i'm
interested
in
the
section
25
problem.
the
briefs--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--for
your
cocounsel
don't
talk
much
about
it,
and
it's...
it's
a
problem
for
me.
justice
scalia's
point
was
let's
assume...
and
i
have
some
doubt
about
it.
let's
assume
that
there's
a
valid
reason
for
redoing
section
23.
that
means
you
need
another
district
to
avoid
retrogression.
what
is...
what
is
your
position
as
to
district
25
on
that
assumption,
based
on
that
assumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
the...
can
the
state
by
its
action
with
one
district,
i.e.,
23,
in
effect
bootstrap
itself
in
a
position
where
it's
entitled
to
use
race
where...
in
a...
in
a
predominant
and
i...
i
think
insulting
way
and...
and
then
have
a
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you
don't
think
that's
a
defense.
it
seems
to
me
the
state
creates
the
very
problem
that
it
claims
that
it
must
use
race
to
settle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
let's
get
back
to
the...
to
the
principle
without
just
talking
about
these...
these
fact
findings.
it...
it
seems
to
me
very
odd
for
you
to
be
telling
us
that
partisan
gerrymandering
is...
is
improper
when
that's
the
sole
or
substantial,
predominant
motivation,
but
then
saying
that
we
can't
correct
it
when
it's
happened.
let's
assume
that
the
1990
legislative
plan
was
one
that
was
done
with...
without
a
wholly
partisan
intent,
but
over
the
years,
it...
it
now
freezes
in
the
democrats
or
party
x
to
having
a
much
greater
advantage
than
the
general
registration
would
give
it.
and
if
it
leaves
it
in
for
a
particularly
partisan
purpose,
why...
why
can't
it
be
redone?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
don't
understand
that
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
say
that
middecennial
districting
is
suspect
or
subject
to
some
special
rules,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you're...
you're
taking
away
a
very
important
deterrent
that
works
on
legislatures
when
they
do
decennial
districting.
if
you
know
as
a
legislature,
when
you
do
a
decennial
districting,
that
your
program
is
going
to
be
presumptively
valid
or
not
subject
to
partisan
gerrymandering,
then...
then
you're...
then
you're
liable
to
overreach.
and
it...
it
seems
to
me
very
dangerous
for
this
court
to
take
away
that
control
mechanism
that
exists
so
that
legislatures
know
that
there's
a
possibility
that
if
they
overreach,
they
can
be
corrected.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
not...
we're
not
trying
the
court
for
a
bad
intent.
we're
looking
at
the
effect
of
what
it's
done,
and
if
the
effect
of
what
it's
done
is
to
leave
in
place
something
that's
slanted
based
on...
on
statewide
registration
in
favor
of
the
democrats,
then...
then,
it
seems
to
me,
there's...
there's
a
ground
for
the
new
legislature
to
act.
and...
and
one...
one
reason
legislatures
may
not
have
redrawn
plans
often
is
because
they
always
protect
incumbents.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
making
the
assumption
that
a
mid
decennial
districting
is
not
interested
in
compactness,
it's
not
interested
in
counties,
it's
not
interested
in
keeping
a
university
within
one...
within
one
district.
that's...
that's
just
simply
not
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
if...
if
your...
if
your
test
is
that
section
2
ought
to
be
opened
up
to
any
racial
group
that
could
influence
an...
an
election,
i
don't
see
the
limits
on
your
principle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
suppose
there's
a
primary
where
it
works
that
they
can
get
on
the
ballot.
suppose
we're
looking
at
the
general
election.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
accept
the
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
23.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
focus
for
a
minute
just
on
the...
what
we
can
call
the
removal,
the
drawing
of
the
lines
to
exclude
some
latino
voters.
just
focus
on
that,
not
the
later
justification.
the
district
court
found
that
this
was
for
political
reasons,
not
racial
reasons,
even
though
it
was
a
largely
racial
group
that
was
removed.
do
you
attack
that
finding
as
clearly
erroneous?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
that
was
because
it
was
deliberate
in
that
case,
and
that's
not
the
hypothetical
that
justice
scalia
has
posed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
the
hypothetical
that
was
posed
to
you
by
the
justice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i...
as
i
understood
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can...
can
the
state
use
race
as
the
means
to
an
end
of
electing
a
new
candidate
that
the
race
wants?
and
what
should
be
the
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
it
sounds
like
you're
going
to
say
race
cannot
be
used
as
this
basis,
but
how
can
race
be
used
not
to
protect
an
incumbent
but
to
allow
the
group
to
choose
the
representative
of
its
choice
and
then
reelect
him
every
year?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
in
your
view,
that
justification
allows
the
creation
of
district
25,
which
has,
as
far
as
latino
population,
people
of
quite
different
economic
backgrounds
and
so
forth,
you
know,
the...
the
two-ended...
the
district
on
the
two
ends.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that...
that
to
me
was...
was
not
discussed
much
in
your
brief,
but
it's
a
serious
shaw
violation.
and...
and
the
two
are
really
linked,
23
and
25,
in
this
respect
because
it
was
by
virtue
of
what
it
did
in
23,
that
the
state
claims
a
right
to
do
what
it
did
in
25.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
as
to
23,
do
you
want
this
court
to
say
that
it's
constitutionally
permissible
to
take
away
a
number
of
minority
voters
from
the
district,
but
leave
just
enough
so
that
it
looks
like
a
minority?
is
that
a
permissible
use
of
race?
it...
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
affront
and
an
insult.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
the
additional
finding
is
that
50
percent
were
kept
to
make
it...
to
make
it
look
good.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
the
reason
the
lines
are
straight
is
nobody
is
there.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
justice
stevens--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
compactness
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let...
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
you
have
a
court
that's
required
to
redistrict,
and
the
court
has
two
experts.
expert
number
one
says,
here
is
a
plan.
it's
totally
partisan
in
its
orientation,
but
it
balances
the
democratic
and
the
republican
registration.
it
gives
them
exactly
proportional
representation.
plan
number
two
gives
minimal
consideration
to
this,
but
it's
compact.
it
takes
into
account
geography,
communities
of
interest,
and
so
forth.
would
the
district
court
be
in
error
if
it
adopted
the
first
plan?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
my
hypothetical
is
designed
to
suggest
that
partisanship,
political
lines
should
be
certainly
a
secondary
consideration
to
a
valid
principled
scheme
and
that
perhaps
in
the
hypothetical
case,
you
could
reverse
a
district
court
for
abuse
of
discretion
in...
in
overemphasizing
political
considerations.
and
then
if
that's
true,
it
means
that
there
is
some
standard
lurking
out
there
indicating
that
political
considerations
should
be
of
at
least
secondary
importance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
25...
the...
the
latino
makeup
of
25
is
accidental?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
accidental.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
cases
that...
that
we've
issued
from
this
court
that
address
what
happens
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
economic
circumstances
and
many
other
circumstances
of
the
two
latino
populations
are
very
different?
the
border
hispanics
and
the
hispanics
in
austin
have
very...
very
little
in
common
other
than...
than
the
latino
background.
are
there...
are
there
cases
that
address
whether
or
not
these
populations
can
be
combined
in...
in
order
to
satisfy
the...
the
voting
rights
act
requirements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
we
talked
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
these
are
consolidated
cases
that
come
to
us
on
appeal
on
the
appellants’
challenge,
a
congressional
redistricting
map
that
the
texas
legislature
enacted
in
2003.
that
2003
legislative
plan
replaced
a
2001
map.
the
2001
map
had
been
drawn
by
the
united
states
district
court
in
earlier
litigation.
as
the
court
has
organized
the
cases,
we
address
three
main
issues
that
are
presented
on
the
appeals:
as
to
some
of
the
issues
there
is
a
judgment
on
the
court,
as
to
other
…
of
the
court,
as
to
other
issues
there
is
an
opinion
for
the
court,
and
i’ll
proceed
through
those
three
in
order.
first,
the
appellants
contend
that
the
new
plan
is
an
unconstitutional
statewide
political
gerrymander.
they
attack
the
congressional
districting
statewide.
second,
they
argue
that
the
plan’s
elimination
of
congressional
district
24
dilutes
the
voting
rights
act
--
the
voting
rights
of
african-americans
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
section
2
prohibits
district
lines
being
drawn
in
a
manner
that
dilutes
the
votes
of
the
minority
group,
so
long
as
that
group
can
satisfy
the
criteria
known
as
the
gingles
factors
or,
you
know,
jurisprudence.
the
third
claim
is
also
a
section
2
claim.
there,
the
appellants
challenge
the
plan’s
alteration
to
district
23
as
an
unlawful
dilution
of
the
voting
rights
of
latinos
in
that
district.
the
district
court
ruled
against
the
appellants
on
all
of
these
three
claims.
first,
as
to
the
statewide
gerrymandering,
two
terms
ago
in
a
case
named
vieth
versus
jubelirer,
five
members
of
this
court
agreed
that
such
a
claim
presents
a
controversy
capable
of
judicial
resolution.
we
do
not
revisit
that
question,
but
we
do
conclude
that
the
appellant’s
statewide
partisan
gerrymandering
claims
must
fail
in
this
case.
the
appellants
argue
this
case
is
different
than
vieth
and
point
to
the
mid-decade
character
of
the
plan’s
enactment.
they
assert
the
plan
was
solely
motivated
by
partisan
objectives
that
serve
no
legitimate
purpose
and
burdened
one
political
group.
neither
the
constitution
nor
federal
statutes
indicate
that
it
is
inherently
suspect
for
a
legislature
to
replace
a
court-ordered
plan
with
one
of
its
own,
and
the
fact
of
a
mid-decade
redistricting
alone
is
no
sure
indication
of
an
unlawful
political
gerrymandering.
at
the
very
end
of
this
claim,
the
appellants
contend
that
the
2003
plan
violates
the
constitution’s
one
person/one
vote
requirement,
and
this
argument,
which
depends
entirely
on
reasoning
that
mirrors
the
attack
on
the
mid-decade
redistricting,
similarly
fails.
the
challenge
to
the
statewide
redistricting
as
an
unconstitutional
gerrymandering
therefore
is
rejected.
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
the
chief
justice,
joined
by
justice
alito,
concur
in
the
judgment;
justice
scalia,
joined
by
justice
thomas,
would
dismiss
these
claims
as
nonjusticiable;
justices
stevens,
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer
join
the
portion
of
the
judgment
declining
to
revisit
justiciability.
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
join
in
rejecting
the
appellant’s
one
person/one
vote
claim;
and
justice
stevens
in
a
separate
opinion,
joined
by
justice
breyer,
would
have
found
a
statewide
unconstitutional
partisan
gerrymandering.
so
the
second
claim
refers
to
district
24.
the
appellant’s
contend
that
the
new
plan’s
elimination
of
former
district
24
violates
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
they
argue
that
because
african-american
voters
control
this
dallas
district,
its
elimination
unlawfully
dilutes
their
voting
rights.
prior
to
the
2003
plan,
district
24
voters
had
elected
an
anglo
democrat
by
the
name
of
martin
frost
in
every
election
since
1978.
even
if
african-americans
in
the
old
district
24
can
state
a
vote-dilution
claim
with
only
25%
of
the
voting
population,
they
cannot
surmount
the
district
court’s
rejection
of
their
questionable
evidence
about
their
ability
to
elect
an
african-american
candidate
of
their
choice.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
alito
join
my
opinion
on
this
point;
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
rely
on
their
position,
stated
in
an
earlier
case
of
holder
v.
hall,
concur
in
the
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
does
not
apply
to
challenges
such
as
these;
in
a
separate
opinion
joined
by
justice
ginsburg,
justice
souter
would
have
held
that
a
minority
group
comprising
less
than
50%
of
a
district’s
voting
population
can
state
a
section
2
vote-dilution
claim;
justice
souter
also
concluded
that
congressman
frost’s
support
in
the
african-american
community
showed
he
was
their
candidate
of
choice,
and
for
these
reasons
he
would
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remand
for
further
proceedings;
justice
stevens
would
have
found
the
elimination
of
district
24
to
be
an
unconstitutional
partisan
gerrymandering.
so
the
judgment
of
the
court
on
this
issue
is
that
the
challenge
to
the
drawing
of
the
lines
for
the
new
district
24
is
rejected.
that
brings
us
to
district
23.
in
order
to
protect
a
republican
incumbent
who
was
losing
support
from
latino
voters,
the
effect
of
the
new
plan
on
district
23
was
to
bring
in
more
republican
voting
anglos
while
reducing
the
number
of
latinos.
these
changes,
of
course,
required
an
adjustment
elsewhere.
this
resulted
in
the
new
district
25,
a
long,
thin
strip
of
land
stretching
from
austin
to
the
mexican
border.
the
new
district
23
is
not
a
latino-opportunity
district,
and
appellants
contend
this
change
violates
section
2.
this
part
of
the
case
is
disposed
of
by
an
opinion
of
the
court,
written
by
me
and
joined
by
justices
stevens,
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer.
unlike
in
former
district
24,
the
gingles
requirements
for
stating
a
threshold
claim
under
section
2
are
satisfied
for
old
district
23.
there
is
no
dispute
that
old
district
23’s
latinos
are
politically
cohesive
and
that
voting
in
the
district
was
racially
polarized.
the
group
of
latino
voters
in
old
district
23
is
also
sufficiently
large
and
geographically
compact
to
constitute
a
majority
in
a
single-member
district.
the
creation
of
a
new
district
25,
we
hold,
does
not
offset
this
loss.
the
district
court
found
that
new
district
25
would
consistently
elect
a
latino
candidate
of
choice,
but
in
our
view
that
does
not
suffice.
the
district
court
did
not
appreciate
that
creating
a
noncompact
district
fails
to
compensate
for
dismantling
a
compact-opportunity
district.
having
found
the
threshold
considerations
for
section
2
claim
satisfied,
we
look
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
after
doing
so,
we
conclude
that
the
elimination
of
the
opportunity
district
violates
section
2.
the
chief
justice,
joined
by
justice
alito,
would
have
found
no
section
2
violation
with
respect
to
section
23;
he
would
have
concluded
that
new
district
25
was
an
effective
minority-opportunity
district
and
that,
even
if
it
were
not,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
weighed
against
finding
a
section
2
violation;
justices
scalia
and
thomas
concur
in
that
dissenting
position,
again
for
the
reasons
that
they
stated
in
holder
versus
hall.
in
summary,
because
the
2003
plan
violates
section
2,
the
court
does
not
address
the
claim
that
use
of

violates

protection
under

amendment
clause.
the
court
also
does
not
address
the
claim
of
equal-protection
violation
in
the
drawing
of
district
25;
justice
scalia,
in
an
opinion
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
thomas
and
alito,
would
have
concluded
the
texas
had
a
strong
basis
for
believing
that
new
district
25
was
necessary
to
comply
with
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
he
has
concluded
that
because
compliance
with
section
5
is
a
compelling
state
interest,
the
district
popularly
rejected
the
race-based
equal-protection
challenge
to
district
25.
in
summary,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
affirmed
in
part,
reversed
in
part
and
vacated
in

and
the
cases
are

opinion.
