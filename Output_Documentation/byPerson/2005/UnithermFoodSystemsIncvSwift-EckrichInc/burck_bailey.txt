mr.
burck
bailey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1947,
this
court
stated,
in
cone
versus
west
virginia
pulp
&
paper
company,
330
u.s.
at
216,
quote,
"determination
of
whether
a
new
trial
should
be
granted,
or
a
judgment
entered
under
rule
50(b),
calls
for
the
judgment
in
the
first
instance
of
the
judge
who
saw
and
heard
the
witnesses
and
has
the
feel
of
the
case,
which
no
appellate
printed
transcript
can
impart.
"
that
language
was
repeated
verbatim
the
following
year
in
globe
liquor
versus
san
roman.
and,
in
the
year
after
that,
both
cone
and
globe
liquor
were
cited
for
the
same
proposition
in
fountain
versus
filson.
and,
in
1952,
in
johnson
versus
new
york
railway,
this
court
again
reiterated
the
requirement...
is
the
word
the
court
used...
of
submitting
a
post
verdict
motion,
or
jnov,
to
preserve
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
for
appellate
review.
mr.
burck
bailey
no,
your
honor.
there
was
a
motion
for
a
remittitur--
mr.
burck
bailey
--of
damages.
mr.
burck
bailey
not
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
argument,
your
honor.
and
that...
this
court
spoke
to
that
in
footnote
9
of
the
weisgram
opinion.
but
a
rule
59
motion
contesting
the
weight
of
the
evidence
would
have
been
appropriate.
no
such
motion
was
filed.
eight
of
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
in
the
absence
of
a
post
verdict
rule
50(b)
motion,
the
appellate
court
cannot
review
for
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
and
that
language
is
in
black
letter
law
in
the
standard
treatises
on
federal
practice,
in
moore's
and
in
wright
&
miller,
that
it
is
absolutely
required.
here--
mr.
burck
bailey
--several
of
them
do--
mr.
burck
bailey
--your
honor.
some
do
not,
but
most,
i
think
it
would
be
accurate
to
say,
do.
and,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
those
cases
are
mistakenly
decided,
because
the
court's
ruling
on
a
50(a)
motion...
that
is,
a
pre
verdict
motion...
is
always
interlocutory.
i
mean,
indeed,
the
trial
court
is
encouraged
to
deny
that
motion,
pending
the
jury
verdict,
because
if
the
jury
comes
back,
obviously,
with
a
defendant's
verdict,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
and
if
the
court,
on
the
other
hand,
grants
it,
and
the
appellate
court
concludes
that
there
was
a
jury
question,
then
it
has
to
go
back
for
a
whole
new
trial.
so--
mr.
burck
bailey
--yes.
mr.
burck
bailey
your--
mr.
burck
bailey
--yes.
your
honor,
i
think
my
answer
to
that
is,
not
infrequently
holes
in
the
plaintiff's
case
are
filled
when
the
defendant's
case
is
put
on.
that
happens,
as
i
say,
rather
frequently,
through
cross
examination
and...
and
it's
just
extremely
iffy
to
say
that
won't
occur.
and,
in
any
event,
your
honor,
it
raises
the
specter
of
this
problem
that
we've
just
talked
about,
that
that
long
trial
that
you...
that
you
envisioned
in
your
hypothetical
would
have
to...
if
the
appellate
court
finds
that
there
is
a
jury
question
there--
mr.
burck
bailey
--has
to
try
it
all
over
again.
not
a...
not
a
very
good
consequence.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
would,
your
honor.
that's
not
authorized.
there's
no
way
to
ask
for
a
new
trial
in
a
50(a)
motion.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
provide
for
that.
the
trial
is
still
going
on.
by
definition,
you
can't
seek
a
new
trial
until
the
trial
is--
mr.
burck
bailey
--concluded.
mr.
burck
bailey
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
you
can
never
ask
for...
move
for
a
new
trial
for...
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
is
against...
the
weight--
mr.
burck
bailey
--of
the
evidence--
mr.
burck
bailey
--well,
your
honor,
i...
my
response
to
that
is
that
these
matters,
pursuant
to
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
cone
and
johnson
and
other
cases,
simply
mandates
that
the
trial
court
be
asked
to
pass
in
the
first
instance
on
this
issue
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
your
honor,
the...
if
i
may,
the
standard
of
review
is
radically
different.
i
mean,
if
motion
for
a
jnov
is
asked
for
and
granted/denied,
the
review
is
de
novo.
the
issue
about
a
new
trial,
under
59,
is
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
that's
certainly
what
the
tenth
circuit
jurisprudence
provides,
your
honor.
and
the
federal
circuit
adopted
that.
mr.
burck
bailey
and
we
think
that
that's
totally
at
odds
with
this
court's
rule
in
cone
and
johnson,
that
it
is
out
of
step
with
the
law
in
eight
federal
circuits,
that
it
simply
is
illogical
to
say,
someone
who
never
asked
for
a
new
trial...
your
honor,
if
they
had...
if
conagra
had
sought
a
new
trial
on
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
federal
circuit,
presumably,
the
federal
circuit
said,
"you
didn't
ask
for
that
below.
"
"it's
gone.
"
it's
waived.
what's
your
next
argument?
"by
not
asking,
they
say,
in
effect.
"
since
you
didn't
ask
for
it,
that's
what
we're
going
to
give
you.
"and
that
simply
is,
your
honor--
"
mr.
burck
bailey
--and,
your
honor,
i...
my
response
is
simply
that
those
are
two
very
different
motions
and
call
for
two
very
different
standards
of
review,
and
it
cannot,
i
respectfully
submit,
logically
be
administered,
when
there's
been
no
request
for
a
new
trial.
there's
no
authority
to
request
a
new
trial
in
a
50(a)
motion.
it
leads
to
the
kind
of
confusion
that,
i
submit--
mr.
burck
bailey
--there...
your
honor,
they
had
moved
for
a
new
trial
in
those
cases.
that
is,
the
defendant
moved
for
a
new
trial.
and
that...
and
this
court--
mr.
burck
bailey
--it
was
reverse.
mr.
burck
bailey
of
the
appellate
court--
mr.
burck
bailey
--of
the
eighth
circuit.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
it
was...
this
court
simply
reversed,
in
cone
and
johnson.
those
cases
went
back
for
retrial.
yes.
mr.
burck
bailey
at
the
trial
or
the
appellate
level,
either
one--
mr.
burck
bailey
--your
honor?
yes.
well,
one
would...
i
quite
agree.
mr.
burck
bailey
but--
mr.
burck
bailey
--but
the--
mr.
burck
bailey
--yes,
your
honor.
and
the
response
i
have
to
make
is
that
the
reviewing
court
would
determine
the
issue
of
new
trial
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
not
on
a
de
novo
review
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
burck
bailey
they...
very
different
grounds
most...
most
commonly,
your
honor.
that
is,
you
can...
there
can
be
completely
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
jury
winner's
verdict--
mr.
burck
bailey
--but
the
court
can
still--
mr.
burck
bailey
--grant
a
new
trial.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
not
insufficient
evidence,
but
the--
mr.
burck
bailey
--the
verdict
is
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
that
is
the
distinction
that
this
court
pointed
out
in
footnote
9
of
weisgram,
that
if
you're
talking
about
the
weight
of
the
evidence...
the
verdict
is
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence;
very
subjective
proposition,
but
that
it
is...
then
you
proceed
under
rule
59.
mr.
burck
bailey
well,
you
can--
mr.
burck
bailey
--i--
mr.
burck
bailey
--your
honor,
i
think
it
shows
respect
to
the
trial
judge
to
require
that
the
trial
judge
be
required,
in
the
first
instance,
to
review
this
evidence
that
the
trial
judge
saw,
heard,
and
has
the
same
opportunity,
as
this
court
has
observed
in
cases
going
back
over
a
century,
to
see,
just
like
the
jurors
saw,
and
provides
a
perspective
on
it
that
is
available
to
the
trial
judge,
alone.
mr.
burck
bailey
your
honors,
if--
mr.
burck
bailey
--i
may,
i'd--
mr.
burck
bailey
--yes,
your
honor.
but
circumventing
the
application
to
the
trial
judge--
mr.
burck
bailey
--in
the
first
instance--
mr.
burck
bailey
--that's
exactly
what
they
said,
your
honor.
and
we
say
they
had
no
authority
to
do
that.
in
the
absence
of
taking
it
in
the
first
instance
before
the
trial
court--
mr.
burck
bailey
--that's--
mr.
burck
bailey
--that's
certainly--
mr.
burck
bailey
--i
may
have
missed,
your
honor--
mr.
burck
bailey
--yes.
mr.
burck
bailey
your
honor,
i
know
of
no
case
where
an
appellate
court
would
do
such
a
thing
when
there's
no
motion
of
any
kind
that's
ever
been
made
contesting
the--
mr.
burck
bailey
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
burck
bailey
i
quite
agree,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
burck
bailey
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
burck
bailey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
burck
bailey
no,
your
honor.
mr.
burck
bailey
the
result
conagra
contends
for
here,
may
it
please
the
court,
leads
to
some
really
bad
results.
it
requires
the
rejection
of
longstanding
precedent
by
this
court.
it
overrules
the
jurisprudence
of
eight
circuits.
it
offends
the
special
competency
of
the
trial
court.
it
deprives
the
appellate
court
of
the
trial
court's
evaluation,
an
impartial
evaluation
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
so
the
appellate
court
is
left
to
sift
through
the
record,
an
entire
record,
searching
for
points
that
have
never
been
joined
below.
and
it
creates
confusion,
subjectivity,
and
differing
legal
standards
nationwide.
thank
you.
