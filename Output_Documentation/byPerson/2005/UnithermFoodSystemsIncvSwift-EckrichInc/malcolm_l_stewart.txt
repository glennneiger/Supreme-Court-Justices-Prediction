mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
a
well
established
principle
of
federal
appellate
practice
that
the
litigant
must
adequately
preserve
a
claim
in
the
trial
court
in
order
to
raise
it
on
appeal.
the
disputed
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
claim
of
insufficient
evidence
is
adequately
preserved
for
appeal
through
the
filing
of
a
pre
verdict
rule
50(a)
motion
or
whether
a
renewed
post
verdict
motion
under
rule
50(b)
must
be
filed,
as
well.
the
text
of
rule
50,
the
practical
considerations
that
underlie
contemporaneous
objection
rules,
and
this
court's
decisions
construing
rule
50
all
indicate
that
a
post
verdict
motion
is
necessary
for
adequate
preservation
of
the
claim.
i
think
it
may
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
often
is.
it
can
be
made--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that's
a
very
typical
practice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
have
to
be
made
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff
case,
but
it
can
be
made
at
any
time
after
the
opposing
party
has
had
an
adequate
opportunity
to
be
heard.
and
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
is
requesting
the
same
sort
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--relief,
but
it...
different
considerations
would
affect
the
trial
judge's
decision
whether
to
grant
the
motion.
and
i
think...
in
a
sense,
this
goes
to
justice
kennedy's
question...
that
is,
one
of
the
reasons
that,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
motion
that's
filed
at
the
conclusion
of
all
the
evidence,
that
these
motions
are
almost
uniformly
not
granted,
the
case
is
almost
always
submitted
to
the
jury,
because
the
thought
is,
very
little
is
lost
by
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury,
because
the
suit
has
been
tried
already,
and
there
may
be
substantial
gains
in
efficiency
from
pursuing
that
course.
i
think
if
a
motion
was
made
at
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
and
the
judge
thought
it
clearly
had
merit
and
thought
that
a
substantial
savings
in
cost
and
time
would
ensue
from
granting
the
motion,
the
trial
judge
could
take
that
into
account
in
deciding
whether
the
motion
should
be
granted
or
not.
but
i
think...
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
text
of
rule
50.
and
it's
reprinted,
among
other
places,
at
page
57(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition.
and
in...
at
the
beginning
of
rule
50(a)(1),
it
says,
"if,
during
a
trial
by
jury,
a
party
has
been
fully
heard
on
an
issue
and
there
is
no
legally
sufficient
evidentiary
basis
for
a
reasonable
jury
to
find
for
that
party
on
that
issue,
the
court
may
determine
the
issue
against
that
party.
"
again,
the
word
"may"
is
permissive.
so,
while
the
judge
may
take
into
account
potential
savings
in
time
and
expense,
the
judge
is
never
required
to
grant
a
rule
50(a)
motion,
even
if
the
judge
is
firmly
persuaded
that
the
evidence
on
the
other
side
is
insufficient.
and
then,
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
the
first
sentence
of
rule
50(b)
says,
"if,
for
any
reason,
the
court
does
not
grant
a
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
made
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence,
the
court
is
considered
to
have
submitted
the
action
to
the
jury,
subject
to
the
court's
later
deciding
the
legal
questions
raised
by
the
motion.
"
and
the
significance
of
that
sentence
is
that
it
says,
"no
matter
what
stated
rationale
the
district
court
gives.
"
--whether
the
district
court
simply
says,
"i'm
reserving
the
motion",
or
says,
"i'm
denying
it,
because
the
evidence
is,
in
my
view,
clearly
sufficient...
whatever
stated
rationale
the
court
gives,
the
action
will
be
treated
as
a
reservation
of
the
legal
questions.
"
and
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
allow
appeal
of
a
sufficiency
claim
without
a
renewed
post
verdict
motion
is
that
in
order
attain
reversal
on
appeal,
regardless
of
whether
the
remedy
is
entry
of
judgment
or
a
new
trial,
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
be
able
to
point
to
an
erroneous
ruling
by
the
district
court.
and
the
reservation
of
a
ruling
on
the
50(a)
motion,
by
its
nature,
can't
be
erroneous.
that
is,
the
judge
is
specifically
authorized
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
don't
believe
that
that's
the
case.
that
is,
at
this
point,
the
rule
has
been
amended
so
that
the
time
for
filing
a
post
verdict
motion
is
10
days
after
entry
of
judgment,
rather
than
10
days
after
verdict,
as
it
used
to
be.
but
this
court
said,
in
johnson,
that,
in
the
absence
of
a
renewed
verdict
post...
a
renewed
motion
post
verdict,
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
may
order
entry
of
judgment
in
the
favor
of
the
verdict
loser.
and
i
think
that
the
text
of
rule
50(b)
bears
that
out.
if
you
look
farther
down
that
paragraph,
on
page
58(a),
the
rule
says,
"submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
is
to
be
treated...
or
considered
to
be
a
reservation
of
the
legal
question.
"
and
then
it
said,
"the
movant
may
renew
the
request.
"
and
then
that
sentence
says,
"in
ruling
on
a
renewed
motion,
the
court
may,
if
a
verdict
was
returned,
allow
the
judgment
to
stand
or
grant
a
new
trail
or
order
entry
of
judgment.
"
and
i
think
that
phrase,
"in
ruling
on
a
new...
renewed
motion.
"
is
significant,
because
the
only
express
authority
that
the
district
court
has,
post
verdict,
to
grant
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
is
that
the
court
may
do
so
in
ruling
on
a
renewed
motion.
the
rule
doesn't
contemplate
a
situation--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
and
the
judge
could
do
that,
either
pre
or
post
verdict.
that
is,
pre
verdict,
the
judge
could
say,
"i
think
your
motion
may
very
well
have
merit,
but,
in
the
interest
of
overall
efficiency,
i'm
going
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury.
"
"but,
in
the
event
that
the
jury
comes
back
against
you,
i
would
encourage
you
to
renew
that
motion.
"
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
judge
encouraging
the
litigant
to
file
something
like
that,
or
signaling
that
the
judge
has
doubts
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
but
the
rule
makes
the
renewed
post
verdict
motion
a
prerequisite
to
entry
of
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
post
verdict.
and
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--he
should.
and,
indeed,
this
court,
in...
as
early
as
montgomery
ward,
have
said
that
was
the
better
practice,
and
that
requirement
has
since
been
codified
in
what
is
now
rule
50(c),
which
says
that
if
the
court
grants
the
motion
for
judgment
as...
the
renewed
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
there
is
also
an
alternative
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
judge
should
rule
on
that,
as
well,
and
should
basically
say,
"in
the
event
that
my
ruling
on
the
jnov...
or
the
jmol--
"
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yeah,
"shall".
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
so,
"in
the
event
that
my
ruling
on
the
sufficiency
question
is
reversed
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
will
know
how
i
would
have
ruled
on
the
new
trial
motion,
and
the
processing
of
the
case
can
be
expedited.
"
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
but
the
court...
this
court,
in
montgomery
ward,
noted
that
there
may
be
inefficiencies
if
the
district
court
rules
on
the
jnov
motion,
but
doesn't
rule
on
the
conditional
motion
for
new
trial,
because
if
the
jnov...
if
the
ruling
on
the
jnov
motion
is
reversed
on
appeal,
then
there's
a
need
for
remand
for
further
proceedings,
and
it's
inefficient.
but
to
return
to
the
point
about
taking
an
appeal
from
a
rule
50(a)
motion,
i
think
it
would
put
a
district
court
in
an
untenable
position
to
say,
"you
can
reserve
ruling
on
the
50(a)
motion,
even
if
you
think
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
"
and,
indeed,
it's
usually
the
better
practice
to
do
so,
but,
if
you
do
that,
and
the
jury
comes
back
against
the
movant,
the
movant
can
take
an
immediate
appeal,
and
you
can
be
reversed
on
the
ground
that
your
ruling
on
the
rule
50(a)
motion
was
erroneous.
there's
simply
no...
by
its...
by
the
terms
of
the
rule
itself,
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury,
in
the
face
of
a
rule
50(a)
motion,
is
considered
to
be
a
reservation
of
the
sufficiency
question.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
conceivably
you
could
have
read
the
rule
that
way
at
the
time
of
johnson,
but
first
we
have
this
court's
decision
in
johnson,
which
says
the
submission
of
a
post
verdict
rule
50(b)
motion
is
an
essential
prerequisite
even
for
the
district
court
to
act
on
the
motion.
and,
therefore,
if
the
motion
is
not
renewed,
the
district
court
is
entitled
to
treat
it
as
abandoned.
and,
second,
the
rule,
in
its
current
form,
limits
the
authority
of
the
district
court
to
enter
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
post
verdict
to
the
situation
where
the
court
is
ruling
on
a
renewed
motion.
the
rule
doesn't
contemplate
a
situation
in
which
the
motion
is
not
renewed
and
yet
the
district
court
purports
to
rule
on
the
50(a)
motion
that
was
left
hanging
by
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
we
would
say,
for
some
of
the
same
reasons
that
mr.
bailey
has
identified,
that
plain
error
review
would
be
inappropriate,
because
in
order
to
have
plain
error,
there
has
to
be
error.
and
if
the
gravamen
of
the
appeal
is
that
denial
of
the
pre
verdict
rule
50(a)
motion
was
plain
error,
it
can't
be
right,
because
the
pre
verdict...
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
is
treated,
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
reservation
of
the
legal
questions,
and
it
can't
be
plain
error
to
reserve
those
questions
for
later
decisions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
that
was...
that
was
the
fact--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--in
johnson,
that
the
district
court
expressly
reserved
its
ruling,
and
the
court,
nevertheless,
held
renewal
as
essential.
