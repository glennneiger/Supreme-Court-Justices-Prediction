and
that
determination
of
what
was
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
typically
left
to
the
trial
judge,
rather
than
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--somewhat
novel
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
reviewing
a
trial
judge
on
the
basis
of
what
it
thought
the
weight
of
the
evidence
was.
it's
one
thing
to
say,
"if
he's
denied
or
granted
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
that
basis,
we'll
look
for
abuse
of
discretion.
"
but
for
the
appellate
court
to
do
that
de
novo
and
assess
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
it
seems,
to
me,
quite
unusual.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
grant
a
new
trial,
it
must
say
one
of
two
things.
it
must
say
either,
number
one,
"there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
but
the
conclusion
of
that
determination
ought
to
be...
and,
therefore,
you
know,
the
case
is
over.
"
but
to
say
that
and
then
say,
"and,
therefore,
we
give
a
new
trial.
"
it
seems
very
strange.
or
else,
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
say,
you
know,
"the
weight
of
the
evidence
was
not
in
the
plaintiff's
favor.
"
and
if
it
says
that,
it's
making
the
kind
of
a
determination
that
i
find
unusual
for
a
court
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
they
could
make
the
same...
if...
i
mean,
if
that
follows,
they
should
be
able
to
do
the
same
thing
when
there
has
been
no
motion
made,
neither
before
nor
after,
right?
they
could
say,
"well,
there's
no
motion
made.
"
"we
really
have
no
authority
to
reverse
this
judgment.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
"but"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
"we
certainly
think
there
was
not
enough
evidence,
and,
therefore,
we
grant
a
new
trial.
"
does
any
court
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
no
motion
has
been
made--
justice
antonin
scalia
--neither
before
the
verdict
nor
after
the
verdict,
does
any
appellate
court
say,
"since
no
motion
was
made,
we
have...
we
have
no
power
to
reverse
the
judgment
here,
but
our
examination
of
the
case
indicates
that
there
was
really
not
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury.
"
"and,
therefore,
we
will
do
the
lesser
thing
and
grant
a
new
trial?
"
does
any
court
of...
appellate
court
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
usual
practice
with
regard
to
the
pre
verdict
motions?
are...
is
the
initial
one
made
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
then
renewed
at
the...
at
the
end
of
all
of
the
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they're
really
different
things
to
be
reviewed
at
those
two
times.
i
mean,
at
the
end
of
all
the
evidence,
there
may
be
some
matter
that
the
defendant
inadvertently
puts
in
that
makes
up
the
deficiency
in
the
plaintiff's
case.
so,
it's
really
a
different
motion,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
i
don't
know
that
you
have
to
read
it
that
way.
i
mean,
you
can
say
that
the...
when
the...
when
the
rule
says
that
it...
that
it
is
deemed
to
have
been
reserved,
it
also
implies
that
the
question
that
was
reserved
is
implicitly
resolved
when
the
court
does
not...
does,
later,
not
act.
it's
an
implicit
denial.
why
can't
you
read
the
rule
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understood.
sorry.
just...
i'm
not
sure
i
understood.
did
you
say
that
even
when
it's
reserved,
the
judge
cannot
go
back
to
the
reserved
motion
and
grant
it
unless
the
motion
is
renewed?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
as
much
of
the
record
as
the
other
side
wanted
to
produce.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
even
sure
your
argument
is
so
strong
on
the
text,
frankly.
i
don't
know
why
50(b)
says...
it
sets
forth
what
can
be
done
when
the
renewed
motion
is
made.
you
can,
if
a
verdict
was
returned,
allow
it
to
stand,
order
a
new
trial,
direct
entry
of
judgment.
if
no
verdict
was
returned,
order
a
new
trial,
direct...
why
does
the
rule
only
say,
"in
ruling
on
a
renewed
motion,
the
court
may?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
say,
"in
ruling
on
a
renewed
motion
or
in
acting
upon
the
motion
previously
reserved.
"
comma,
"the
court
may"?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
where
does
it
get
the
power
to
do
these
things,
in
ruling
on
a
motion
previously
reserved,
if
it's
not
set
forth
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
only
remedy
available
after
the
motion
has
been
reserved,
after--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
court
has
declined
to
rule
on
it
once.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
it
order
a
new
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
he
get
that
power,
under
(a)?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless--
justice
antonin
scalia
--ah.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well,
then
it
shouldn't
have
been
set
forth
in
(b).
you
didn't
have
to
say
it.
you
could
have
just
said,
you
know,
"allow"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
a
judge
grant
a
new
trial
on
a
50(a)
motion?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
on
the
answer...
with
the
answer
to
the
last
question
i
asked?
can...
on
a
50(a)
motion,
can
a
judge
grant
a
new
trial
instead
of
granting
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't.
