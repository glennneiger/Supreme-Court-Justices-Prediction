justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
issue
that's
before
us
now,
i
can
understand
why,
if
the,
what
we
used
to
call,
jnov
is
not
requested
after
the
jury
verdict,
the
appellate
court
could
not
then
enter
judgment...
direct
the
entry
of
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
i
don't
see
why
it
couldn't
say,
just
as
we
would
be
reluctant
to
affirm
a
decision
when
there
was
no
claim
for
relief,
so,
if
there's
insufficient
evidence,
we
can
remand
for
a
new
trial.
but
you
would
say
that
that
is
not
possible
either.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
haven't
asked
for
it,
but
the
appellate
court
said,
"we
don't
want
to
affirm
a
judgment
when
there
was
insufficient
evidence,
so
we
are
going
to.
"
--there
was...
the
judge
was
tipped
off
by
the...
by
the
directed
verdict
motion,
that
the...
who
turned
out
to
be...
the
one
who
turned
out
to
be
the
verdict
loser
thinks
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
that's
enough
at
least
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
grant
a
new
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i'm
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--talking
about
"against
the
weight",
because
a
trial
judge
would
rarely
be...
if
it...
if
a
trial
judge
said,
"it's
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
"
it
would
go
back
for
a
new
trial,
and
you
couldn't
raise
that
issue,
at
least
not
til
you
go
through
the
whole
second
trial.
but
why
isn't
it
like...
i
think
there
are
decisions
that
said
there
was
a
judgment,
but
the
court
of
appeals
determines
there
was
never
a
claim
for
relief
to
begin
with,
even
though
a
motion
wasn't
made
to
that
effect.
the
idea
of
a
court
affirming
a
judgment
that
is
without
sufficient
legal
basis
is
troubling.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
it...
but
it
was
asked
by
the...
by
the
pre
verdict
motion.
what...
the
only
thing
that
wasn't
done
is,
it...
the
request
wasn't
repeated
after
the
verdict.
i
can
see
your
point
if
there
had
never
been
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
at
the
close
of
all
of
the
evidence.
but
there
was
that.
and
so,
all
that
we're
missing
is
a
repetition
of
the
same
words
after
the
jury
comes
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's...
the
new
trial
comes
in,
by
the
courts
that
have
said
this,
only...
they'd
say,
"we
would
direct
the
entry
of
judgment
for
the
verdict
loser,
but
we're
powerless
to
do
that.
"
and
that
is
all
wrapped
up
in
the
seventh
amendment.
so,
the
next
best
thing
is,
we
grant
a
new
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
couldn't
one
regard
a
new
trial
as,
sort
of,
subsumed
under
the
request
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law?
that
is,
that's
the
larger
thing,
but
at
least
a
new
trial.
don't
let...
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
says,
"don't
let
this
verdict
stand".
so,
one
could
say,
"we
won't
give
you
a
judgment,
but
we
will
order
a
new
trial.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
your
response
to
me
about
vastly
different
standards
of
review.
i
would
think
it
would
be
harder
for
a
verdict
loser
to
get
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
than
to
get
a
new
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
suggesting--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
one
is
kind
of
a
lesser
included.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
don't
think
any
appellate
court
has
claimed
that
authority.
we're
talking
about
a
new
trial
in
lieu
of
j...
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
the...
one
of
the
whole
rationales
in
cone
and
globe
and
all
of
the
others
was...
saying
you
should
make
the
post
verdict
motion...
is
that
then
the
trial
judge
would
have
the
option.
the
trial
judge
might
think,
"well,
technically,
you
deserve
jmol,
but
maybe
there
was
a
witness
who
was
out
to
sea,
so
i
want
to
exercise
my
discretion
to
grant
a
new
trial.
"
those
two
are
closely
linked.
i
mean,
lawyers
usually,
as
a...
just
a
matter
of...
just
automatically
ask
for
jnov
or,
in
the
alternative,
a
new
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
fact,
that's
not
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said.
they
have
all
said,
"we
would
grant
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
we're
powerless
to
do
that
under
this
case...
court's
case
law.
"
"we
think
the
evidence
is
insufficient,
not
that
it's
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
"
"we
think
it's
insufficient.
"
"if
we
had
the
power
to
do
it,
we
would
direct
the
entry
of
judgment.
"
"we
can't
do
that,
so
we
do
the
next
best
thing.
"
but
in
all
of
the...
including
the
tenth
circuit,
whose
law
is
relevant
here...
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying,
"we
think
the
judgment...
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
that
judgment.
"
"and
if
we
had
the
power,
we
would
instruct
the
entry
of
judgment.
"
"we
don't
have
that
power.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a...
it's
a
conditional
ruling
on
the
new
trial
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
if
it
were
a
ruling
on
the
new
trial
motion,
you
would
never
get
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
stop
you
with
that
point?
because
one
of
the
things
that
unitherm
said
about
that
argument...
which,
as
you
prefaced,
is
not
before
us...
is,
the
court
of
appeals
was
looking
to
a
truncated
record
to
see
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
that,
in
fact,
the
record
was
much
larger
than
the
piece
of
it
that
the
federal
circuit
examined,
so
that
the
federal
circuit,
when
it
says
there
was
no
evidence,
was
looking
to
the
appendix
that
was
before
us,
but
that
was
not
the
whole
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
under
this
federal
circuit's
own
law,
it
could
not
be,
because
there
had
not
been
the
post
verdict
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
federal
circuit
is
borrowing
tenth
circuit's
law
for
this
purpose,
but
the
tenth
circuit's
law,
as
i
understand
it,
has...
is
the
position
that
was
just
presented
to
us
by
mr.
stewart.
that
is,
if
you
don't
make
what
used
to
be
called
the
jnov,
even
if
you
made
the
directed
verdict,
you
can't
raise
the
sufficiency
on
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
federal
circuit's
own
rule?
it...
it
was,
i
thought,
pretty
clear
what
it
told
us
in
that
footnote,
that
if
we
were
ruling...
making
the
ruling...
the
federal
circuit
law
is,
if
you
don't
make
the
50(b)
motion,
you
cannot
get
a
reversal
on
appeal
for
insufficient
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
borrow--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
tenth
circuit
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
that's...
in
respect
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
the...
unitherm
could
have
thought,
"well,
the
federal
circuit
is
not
going
to
deal
with
sufficiency;
therefore,
i
don't
have
to
beef
up--
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"#
what
i
put
in
the
appendix.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
looking
at
the
motion
that
you
made,
which
was
not
in
the
first
instance
for
a
new
trial;
it
was
for
a
remittitur.
this
is
on
page
34(a)
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
you
made
a
motion,
in
the
alternative,
for
a
new
trail
on
antitrust
damages,
not
liability.
so,
i
was
really
struck
by
the
statement
in
your
brief
that
you
had,
indeed,
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
you
made
it
a
motion
for
a
remittitur
and,
in
the
alternative,
a
new
trial,
limited
to
damages.
you
said
nothing
about
a
new
trial
on
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
new
trial
on
damages...
that's
all
you
asked
for...
not
a
new
trial
on
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was...
the
new
trial
request
had
to
do
with
liability--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--whether
it
was
for
newly
discovered
evidence
or
something
else.
but
you...
your
motion
was
limited
to
damages.
and
i
really
don't
think
that
you
can
get
where
you
want
to
go
from
a
motion
that
is
limited
to
damages,
when
you
didn't
need
to.
you
could
have
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
whole
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
principal
point
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
enter...
direct
the
entry
of
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
if
a
50(b)
motion
had
not
been
made.
that's
what
those
three
cases--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--invoke.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
it
can't...
it
can't
be...
it
would
be
interlocutory
at
that
stage.
it
couldn't
be
raised
until
final
judgment
is
entered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
don't
go
up
on
appeal
with
a
final
judgment
rule,
a
firm
final
judgment
rule,
as
there
is
in
the
federal
system,
from
the
denial
or
refusal
to
act
on
a
50(a)
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
trial
isn't
over.
there
is
no
judgment.
you
can't
appeal
til
you
have
a
final
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
is,
you
know...
i
mean,
this
truly
is
a
case
where
a
page
of
history
is
worth
much
more
than
logic.
the
reason
for
that
somewhat
strange
language
is,
at
common
law,
it
was
thought,
once
the
jury
came
in
with
a
verdict,
that
was
it,
the
judge
had
no
power
to
overturn
it,
because
of
the
seventh
amendment's
reexamination
clause,
"no
fact
tried
by
a
jury,
shall
be
otherwise
re
examined
in
any
court
of
the
united
states,
than
according
to
the
rules
of
common
law.
"
and
the
rule
of
common
law
that
is
embodied
in
this
somewhat
strange
language
in
rule
50
is
that
there
could
be
a
reserved
question
so
that
after
the
jury
comes
in
with
the
verdict,
the
judge
would
be
deciding
the
pre
verdict
question
by
this
post
verdict
motion.
i
mean,
there's...
none
of
this
is
in
doubt,
where
this
language
in
50
comes
from.
it
comes
from
a
need
to
adjust
to
the
reexamination
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
get
it
out
of
that
language,
because
that
language
is
there
for
the
specific
purposes
of
allowing
a
judge,
after
their
verdict,
to
enter
judgment
nov.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
doesn't
enter
judgment
to
trigger
the
50(b)
motion.
the
50(b)
motion
is
made
in
between
the
verdict
and
the
entry
of
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
don't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
don't
follow
that,
because
you...
you
know,
i'm
sure,
that
it's
almost
routine
that...
yes,
you
have
the
10
days,
the
extra
10
days,
under
the
rules...
but
isn't
it
almost
routine,
at
a
trial,
that
the
verdict
loser
will
say,
"judge,
please
give
me
jnov,
or,
if
not,
a
new
trial?
"
they
don't
wait
til
after
the
judgment
is
made...
entered.
they
could.
but
it's
just...
well,
in
the
trials
i've
seen,
it's
almost
by
rote
that
lawyers
who
lose,
where
the
jury
comes
in
for
the
other
side,
will
renew
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
motion
and
ask,
in
the
alternative,
for
a
new
trial.
isn't
that
the
common
practice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
not
a
question
of
what
is
required
or
what
is
permissive,
but
isn't
it
to
the
lawyer's
advantage,
to
the
client's
advantage,
to
say
to
the
judge,
sooner
rather
than
later,
"don't
enter
judgment.
"
"give
me...
give
me
judgment
nov
or
at
least
a
new
trial?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sent
back
to...
for
a
new
trial
because
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
a
new
trial,
or
sent
back
to
the
trial
court
for
that
court
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
that
court's
discretion,
whether
to
order--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
new
trial?
the
latter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
not...
but,
here,
you're
asking
us
to
affirm
something
that
a
court
of
appeals
did.
