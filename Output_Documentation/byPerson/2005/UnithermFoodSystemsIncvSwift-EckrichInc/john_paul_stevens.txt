do
any
of
those
circuits
allow
an
exception
for
plain
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
refresh
my
recollection?
in
the
cases
you
cited
at
the
outset
of
your
argument,
where
the
judgments
were
reversed,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking,
in
those
cases,
there
was,
in
fact,
a
new
trial
afterwards?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
judgment
of
this
court
was
simply
reverse,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
were--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
trial
court
could
do
that,
pursuant
to
rule
59(d),
couldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say,
the
trial
court
could
have
done
that
pursuant
to
rule
59(d)
without
a
motion
being
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
stewart,
just
let
me
clear
up
one
thing
of
confusion.
is
it
not
true
that
if
the
district
judge
denies
the
motion
before
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury,
within
10
days
after
the
jury
verdict,
if
no
further
motion
is
made,
he
would
still...
the
judge
would
still
have
authority
to
change
his
mind
and
grant
the
motion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you're
saying
that
if
the
judge
wants
to
do
what
i...
what
i
hypothesized,
the
judge
should
say
to
the
losing
party,
"renew
your
motion,
and
i'll
grant
it.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
the...
the
antitrust
standing
issue
is
not
the
same
as
the
relevant
market
issue
that
was
decided,
is
it?
