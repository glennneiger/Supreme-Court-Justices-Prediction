justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it
doesn't
say
it...
it
is
deemed
to
continue
to
be
pending.
the
issue
is
deemed
to
be
reserved.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
a
very
different
issue.
in
other
words,
it's
not
waived
and
over
with
at
that
point,
but
it
says
nothing
whatsoever,
in
express
terms,
about
pending
motions.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
the
issue
is
reserved.
the
motion
has
been
ruled
upon.
the
judge
says,
"no,
i'm
not
going
to
grant
this
motion
before
submitting
the
issue
to
the
jury.
"
that's
the
end
of
the
motion.
the
issue
isn't
over
with,
because
it
can
be
raised
again
after
the
verdict.
isn't
that
what
the
rule
provides?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
let's
assume
it's
extremely
apparent.
isn't...
and
assume,
just
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
we
have
a
simple
case,
not
a
complex
case,
so
it's
easy
to
see
that,
in
fact,
the
evidence
falls
short.
it's
still
the
case
that
this
court
has
discouraged,
or
has
certainly...
has
either
discouraged
the
granting
of
motions
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
or
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence...
in
any
event,
has
put
its
imprimatur
on
denying
those
motions,
subject
to
renewal
after
verdict.
how
can
we
possibly
find
that
there
is
plain
error
when
a
court
does
exactly
what
we
have
encouraged
them
to
do
in
order
not
to
waste
a
lot
of
trial
time
and
jury
time?
how
could
we
ever
find
there
is
plain
error,
except
with
respect
to
the
renewed
motion
after
the
verdict?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
we
have
said,
"don't
grant
it".
justice
david
h.
souter
and
we
have
said,
"don't
grant
it".
justice
david
h.
souter
it
could
do
that
even
after
it
had
ruled
upon
it
and
had
denied
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
will...
i
will
grant
you
that,
were
it
not
for
our
cases,
textually,
the
argument
you
make
is
possible.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
make
that
argument
without
our
overruling
a
lot
of
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--rule
doesn't
deem
it
to
have
been
deferred.
a
judge
may,
in
fact,
not
rule
on
it,
although
he
does
not
grant
it.
but
the
rule
does
not
say
that
the
motion
is
deemed
to
be
deferred.
the
rule
talks
about
the
issue
being
reserved,
which
is
a
different
thing.
and
the
issue
may
be
reserved
whether
the
judge
rules
on
the
motion
or
simply
says,
"i
will
take
it
under
advisement
and
you
can
renew
it
after
the
verdict
if
you
want
to.
"
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
it's
still
the
case
that
the
rule
does
not
deem
the...
this
rule
does
not
deem,
in...
terms,
the
ruling
on
the
pre
verdict
motion
to
have
been
deferred.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
asking
you
about
what
this
rule
says.
did
i
just
get
the
rule
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--want
to
answer
the
question,
just
say
so.
