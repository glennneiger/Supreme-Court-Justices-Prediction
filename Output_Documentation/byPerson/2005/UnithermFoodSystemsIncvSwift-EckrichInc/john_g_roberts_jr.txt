we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
unitherm
food
systems
versus
swift
eckrich.
mr.
bailey.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
go
to
different
things,
don't
they?
i
mean,
if
you...
you
get
a
new
trial
when
there
are...
you
know,
evidence
is
admitted
that
shouldn't
have
been
admitted,
or
something
like
that.
i
mean,
they're...
they're,
sort
of,
different
grounds.
they're
not
overlapping,
are
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--this
is
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--right.
i
mean...
i'm
not
sure.
i
mean,
is
it
a...
is
insufficient
evidence
a
typical
ground
for
asking
for
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
bailey.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
plain
error
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
schroeder.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
if
they
had
been
on--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
they
had
been
on
notice
that
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
going
to
be
an
issue,
they
might
have
put
more
in
the
record
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why...
it's...
why
is
that
a
lesser
remedy?
it's
just
different.
i
mean,
remittitur
is
a
lesser
remedy,
too,
but
you
don't
say,
"well,
if
you've
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and
then
that
falls
by
the
wayside,
you...
the
court
can
do
remittitur.
"
the
approach
seems
to
be,
"something's
wrong
here,
and
we
have
to
do
something,
so
what
is
it
that
we
can
do?
"
and
you
look
around,
"well,
maybe
we
can
give
them
a
new
trial,
or
maybe
we
can
have
a
remittitur.
"
but
there
are
different
motions
for
all
these
different
things,
and,
if
they
haven't
been
made,
they
seem
to
be
off
the
board.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
problem
there
is
still
the
same.
whatever
it
is
that
gave
rise
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
a
sanction...
the
misconduct
by
counsel...
you're
still
addressing
that
same
problem.
but
a
new
trial
addresses
different
issues
than
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
remittitur
addresses
different
issues
than
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
an
extreme
case,
because
there's
insufficient
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--not
going
to
be
plain
error
in
every
insufficient
evidence
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
bailey,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bailey.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
in
no.
