justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
petitioner
unitherm
sells
a
process
for
browning
precooked
meats.
respondent
conagra
has
a
patent
pertaining
to
that
process
and
sought
to
enforce
its
patent
against
unitherm.
in
response,
unitherm
filed
suit
in
federal
court,
where
it
sought
a
declaration
that
conagra’s
patent
was
invalid
and
alleged
that
conagra
had
violated
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
by
attempting
to
enforce
a
patent
that
was
obtained
by
committing
fraud
on
the
patent
and
trademark
office.
the
district
court
determined
that
conagra’s
patent
was
invalid
and
permitted
unitherm’s
sherman-act
claim
to
proceed
to
trial.
prior
to
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury,
conagra
moved
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
50(a)
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
contending
that
unitherm
had
failed
to
present
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
its
claim.
the
district
court
denied
that
motion
and
submitted
the
case
to
the
jury.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
unitherm,
and
conagra
neither
renewed
its
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
pursuant
to
rule
50(b)
nor
moved
for
a
new
trial
on
antitrust
liability
pursuant
to
rule
59.
on
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit,
conagra
sought
to
pursue
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
claim
it
had
raised
in
its
rule
50(a)
motion.
though
the
federal
circuit
has
concluded
that
a
party’s
failure
to
renew
its
challenge
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
pursuant
to
rule
50(b)
forecloses
appellate
consideration
of
such
challenges,
it
was
bound
by
circuit
precedent
to
apply
the
law
of
the
10th
circuit
to
this
issue.
under
10th
circuit
law,
the
court
of
appeals
may
consider
challenges
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
even
when
a
party
has
failed
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
rule
50.
if
the
court
of
appeals
finds
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
the
verdict,
the
court
of
appeals
may
order
a
new
trial,
although
it
may
not
grant
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
again,
that's
under
10th
circuit
precedence.
in
accordance
with
this
practice,
the
federal
circuit
determined
that
unitherm’s
evidence
was
insufficient
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
we
granted
cert.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
rule
50(b)
sets
forth
the
procedural
requirements
for
renewing
insufficiency-of-the-
evidence
challenge
after
the
jury
verdict
and
the
entry
of
judgment.
it
provides,
in
relevant
part,
that
a,
“movant
may
renew
its
request
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
by
filing
a
motion
no
later
than
10
days
after
entry
of
judgment,
and
may
alternatively
request
a
new
trial
or
join
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
under
rule
59”.
this
court
has
addressed
the
implications
of
a
party’s
failure
to
file
a
post-verdict
motion
under
rule
50(b)
on
several
occasions.
in
cone
versus
west
virginia
pulp
&
paper,
this
court
concluded
that,
in
the
absence
of
a
rule
50(b)
motion,
“an
appellate
court
is
without
power
to
direct
the
district
court
to
enter
judgment
contrary
to
the
one
it
had
permitted
to
stand”.
in
support
to
this
conclusion,
this
court
observed
that
a
post-verdict
50(b)
motion
is
necessary,
because
determination
of
whether
a
new
trial
should
be
granted
or
a
judgment
entered
under
rule
50(b)
calls
for
the
judgment
in
the
first
instance
of
the
district
court.
moreover,
in
johnson
versus
new
york,
this
court
held
that
the,
“requirement
of
a
timely
application
for
judgment
after
verdict
is
not
an
idle
motion,
because
it
is
an
essential
part
of
the
rule
firmly
grounded
in
the
principles
of
fairness”.
the
only
difference
between
these
authorities
and
the
case
before
us
today
is
that
instead
of
directing
the
district
court
to
enter
judgment,
the
federal
circuit
directed
the
district
court
to
conduct
a
new
trial;
but
this
distinction
is
immaterial.
this
court’s
observations
about
the
necessity
of
a
post-verdict
motion
under
rule
50(b)
and
the
benefits
of
the
district
court’s
input
at
that
stage
apply
with
equal
force
whether
a
party
is
seeking
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
or
simply
a
new
trial.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
because
respondent
failed
to
renew
its
pre-verdict
motion
as
specified
in
rule
50(b),
there
was
no
basis
for
review
of
respondent’s
sufficiency-of-the-evidence
challenge
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
kennedy
joins.
