just
while
i
have
you,
i'm...
just
while
i
have
you
here...
it's
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--probably,
directly
relevant
to
this
case.
on
that
one
point,
when
i
was
in
practice,
it
used
to
irritate
me
sometimes
that
the
judge
should
grant
the
motion
and
then
he'd
just
sit
on
it.
but
i
see
the
wisdom
for
the
rule
now,
and
the
judge
reserving
it,
in
the
event
the
jury
comes
out
the
right...
the,
quote,
"right
way",
anyway.
what
if
there's
a
very
long
trial?
what
if,
after
the
plaintiff
rests,
there's
a
good
grounds
for
granting
the
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
judge
doesn't
do
it,
and
then
there's
a
3-month
trial?
do
the
judges
ever
take
that
into
account?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
three
more
months
for
the
defense
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me,
if
we
adopt
your
position,
what
should
a
trial
court
do
if
he,
alternatively,
would
grant
a
new
trial?
should
he
go
ahead
and
make
that
determination?
he
grants
judgment
nov.
and
then
he
really
is
thinking,
"well,
i
would
have
granted
a
new
trial.
"
should
he
go
ahead
and
cover
himself
against
reversal
by
granting
the
new
trial
in
the
alternative,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--"shall".
it
does
say
"shall".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says
"shall".
thank
you.
