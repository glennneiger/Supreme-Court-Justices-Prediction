mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
getting
to
some
of
these
questions
that
have
been
discussed
this
morning,
i
think
it's
helpful
to
ground
ourselves
a
little
bit
in
the
fundamental
decision
made
by
the
federal
circuit
that
is
not
within
this
court's
grant
of
certiorari,
and,
therefore,
is
the
foundation
from
which
we
proceed.
and,
rather
succinctly,
the
federal
circuit
said,
"unitherm
never
presented
any
evidence
that
could
possibly
support
critical
factual
elements
of
its
claim.
"
"in
particular,
unitherm
failed
to
present
any
facts
that
could
allow
a
reasonable
jury
to
accept
either
its
proposed
market
definition
or
its
demonstration
of
antitrust
injury.
"
building
on
that
foundation,
unitherm
wants
a
judgment
entered
in
its
favor
for
$19
million
for
the
injury
that
they
have
never
proven.
and,
to
get
there,
they
have
to
accomplish
each
of
three
things.
first--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--your
honor,
in
the
federal
circuit,
each
party
had
the...
had
the
ability
to
put
any
part
of
the
record,
or
the
entire
record,
before
the
court,
and,
under
the
federal
circuit's
own
rule,
they
were
also
entitled
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
record,
whether
it
was
in
the
appendix
or
not.
so,
the
entire
record--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--was--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--when
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
federal
circuit,
your
honor,
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
presented
as
an
issue
at
that
time.
and
so,
that
was--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
that--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
your
honor,
going
to
the
federal
circuit,
of
course,
the
meaning
of
rule
50
was
in
dispute.
and
it
was
certainly,
at
that
point,
conagra's
position
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient...
was
insufficient,
and
that
was
the
issue
before--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--the
court.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
that
is
the
federal
circuit
rule
in
patent
infringement
cases.
it
was
not
the
rule
that
the
federal
circuit
would
apply
in
this
case,
because
the
federal
circuit
would
apply--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--apply
the
rule
of--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--certainly,
they
did
have
to
deal
with
that,
your
honor,
because
one
of
the
grounds
for
appeal
was
that
there
as
no
antitrust
standing.
so,
this
issue
was
before
the
federal
circuit,
no
matter
how
you
view
the
question.
but
i
think
in
addition
to
that,
certainly
everyone
knew,
when
this
case
went
to
the
federal
circuit,
that
it
was
conagra's
position
that
tenth
circuit
law
applied,
and
that
the
evidence
should
be
reviewed
for
its
sufficiency--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--no,
it's
not,
but
it
certainly
is
the
same
with
respect
to
antitrust
injury,
and
the
federal
circuit
found
there
was
no
evidence
of
antitrust
injury.
so,
there,
the
entire
record
should
have
been
before
the
federal
circuit.
and,
in
fact,
it
was.
and
so,
when
they
made
the
determination
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
antitrust
injury,
they
did
that
in
the
presence
of
a
full
record
on
that
issue.
there
was
no
way
that
anyone
could
have
thought
that
that
issue
was
not
before
the--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
we
have
to
assume
they
covered
their
bases,
your
honor,
yes.
now,
let
me
talk
a
little
bit
about
some
of
these
issues
that
have
come
up.
first,
with
respect
to
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
there
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
under
rule
59,
filed
in
this
case.
the
grounds
for
that
motion
were
not
sufficiency
of
the
evidence;
but,
under
rule
59,
when
a
motion
is
made
for
a
new
trial,
on
any
grounds,
it
is
before
the
district
court
on
all
grounds.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
merely
pointing
out
that,
under
rule
59,
once
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
made,
all
issues
relating
to
a
new
trial
are
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
certainly
would
refer
the
court
to
the
cone
case,
which
i
think
is
very
similar
to
this
case,
procedurally.
in
cone,
there
was
a
rule
59
motion.
there
was
no
rule
50(b)...
excuse
me,
a
rule
50(a)
motion,
no
rule
50(b)
motion.
there
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
grounds
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
nevertheless,
in
the
cone
case,
the
court
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings,
and
the...
and
the
court
below
considered
the
question.
and,
in
the
end...
the
published
opinions
indicate,
that
case
went
back
to
the
fourth
circuit,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--in
the
end--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
if
there
were
no
proof
of
damages,
the
whole
antitrust
claim
would
fail.
but
i
would
also
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
when
a
motion
is
made
under
rule
50(a)
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
certainly
permits
the
district
court
to
grant
a
new
trial,
because
it's
a
lesser
remedy.
and
we
see
situations
all
the
time--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
certainly,
your
honor...
let's
take
another
example.
suppose
a
litigant
asks,
as
sanctions,
that
the
case
be
dismissed.
well,
the
district
court
certainly
could
say,
"well,
you
have
a
point,
sanctions
are
in
order.
"
"but
i'm
not
going
to
dismiss
the
case,
i'm
going
to
give
you
something
else.
"
there
are
many
situations
like
that,
where
a
particular
remedy--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
the
principal
point
of
the
trilogy
that
when
a
motion
is
made
for
entry
of
judgment
based
on
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
that
raises
the
question
of
whether
there
ought
to
be
a
new
trial.
that
was
the
principal
point
discussed
in
the
trilogy,
that
you
really
can't
have
one
without
the
other.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
that's--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
the
trilogy
stands
for
that
proposition.
but
in
all
three
cases
of
the
trilogy,
even
though
there
was
no
rule
50(b)
motion,
those
cases
were
all
remanded.
in
no
case
was
the
verdict
winner
who
had
insufficient
evidence
allowed
to
prevail.
they
just
remanded
the
cases.
so,
the
solicitor
general
relies
on
stare
decisis,
but
he's
asking
the
court
to
do
something
radically
different
from
what
happened
in
any
of
those
cases
of
the
trilogy.
they're
asking
that
judgment
be
entered
for
the
party
that
failed
to--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--it's
not
clear
from
the
record,
i
don't
believe,
as
to
all
of
the
cases,
your
honor,
but
certainly
it
is
clear
in
the
first
case,
the
cone
case,
that
there
was
a
motion--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--for
a
new
trial,
but
it
was
based
on
different
grounds.
it
was
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
when
you
say
"that",
your
honor,
you
mean
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
new
trial
or
with
respect--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--the--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--yes,
your
honor.
i'm
glad
you
raised
that
point,
because
it
is
the
fundamental
point
of
the
case.
rule
50(a)
provides
that
a
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
can
be
made,
and
specifically
says
that
the
judge
can
grant
that
motion.
and
then
the
rule
goes
on
to
say
that
that
motion
is
deemed
to
continue
to
be
pending.
there
is
nothing
in
rule--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
oh,
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
paraphrased
the
rule.
but
the
point
is
that
the
motion
is
still
pending.
in--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--that's
certainly
not
the
way
i
would
read
it,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
if
the
court...
if
the
rule
says
that
the
rule
50(a)
motion
can
be
granted;
conversely,
it
can
be
denied.
if
it
can
be
granted
or
denied,
those
decisions
are
appealable
under
section
2106,
which
is
the
general
provision
that
orders
of
the
court
can
be
appealed.
i
do
not
see
anything
in
rule
50
that
says
that
denial
of
the
50(a)
motion
is
not
appealable.
what
rule
50(b)
does
is--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
a
most
peculiar
rule.
entering
judgment
in
a
case
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
and
important
things
that
a
court
does.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--that's
certainly
correct,
your
honor,
there
can
be
no
appeal
without
a
final
judgment.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
an
interpretation
of
rule
50,
as
a
whole,
which
says
to
the
trial
court
judge
that
a
judgment
should
be
entered
without
resolving
the
question
of
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence,
and
then
take
that
up
later,
under
rule
50(b),
isn't
a
very
good
way
to
proceed.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
yes,
that's
all
correct,
your
honor.
but
if
there
were
no
provision
of
the
rule
that
reserved
decision
under
50(a),
i
would
still
say
that
the
denial
of
the
50(a)
motion
should
be
appealable
when
the
judgment
is
entered,
because
the...
all
of
the
prior
orders
of
the
court
merge
into
that
judgment
when
it's
entered.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
yes,
your
honor.
it
certainly
is
there
for
that
purpose.
but
the
rule
doesn't
mandate
that
the
court...
that
the
case
proceed
by
that
route.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
once
the
50(a)
motion
is
made
and
denied,
the
stage
is
set
for
an
appeal
pursuant
to
section
2106.
the
rule
50(b)
route
is
merely
there
to
allow
a
litigant,
who
does
not
believe
that
the
issue
has
been
fully
heard,
briefed,
considered
by
the
court,
to
raise
the
issue
again,
but
not
to
put
us
in
the
position
where,
in
the
normal
course,
the
judge
follows
the
usual
procedure
of
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury,
because
the
jury
may
resolve
the
problem
by
deciding
the
case
in
favor
of
the
party
that
should
win
on
the
evidence,
but
then,
at
that
point,
the
judge
merely
has
to
enter...
has
to
enter
judgment
in
order
to
trigger
the
50(b)
motion.
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
good
way
to
proceed,
and
i
don't
believe
that's
what's
contemplated
by
the
rule.
and,
in
fact,
it
is
a
common
practice
among--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
your
honor,
the
rule
says
that
it
can
be
made
up
to
10
days--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--after
the
entry
of
judgment.
so,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
district
court,
if
the
court
ever
wants
to
get
to
the
end,
wants
to
put
a
time
limit
on
this,
the
only
way
to
do
it
is
to
enter
judgment.
that
forces
the
moving
party
to
get
a
50(b)
motion--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--on
account
of
the
defendant.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well,
i
think
it's
a
common
practice
in
those
circuits
which
have
indicated
that
a
50(b)
motion
is
required
to
preserve
all
rights
to
appellate
review.
whether
or
not
it
is
the
common
practice
in
other
circuits
where
that
is
not
required,
i'm
not
sure.
certainly--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
your
honor,
this
case
may
be
a
little
different
from
some,
in
that
the
precise
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
federal
circuit,
the
failure
of
proof,
was
something
that
was
identified
very
early
in
the
case.
and
it
was
presented
numerous
times
to
the
district
court
by
a
way
of
a
summary
judgment
motion,
by
way
of
the
pretrial
briefs.
and
the
issue
had
not
changed.
and,
in
fact,
when
the
50(a)
motion
was
made,
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
the
court
may
have
noticed
that
it
was
made
in
a
rather
peculiar
way,
an
attorney
attempting
to
persuade
the
court
that
that
motion
should
be
granted
wouldn't
begin
the
motion
by
saying,
"for
the
record".
but
that's
what
happened
here.
it
was
known,
at
that
point,
that
the
judge
had
made
up
her
mind
as
to
this
issue,
and
wasn't
going
to
change
it,
and,
in
fact,
declined,
on
several
occasions,
to
even
listen
to
argument
on
the
point.
so,
the
filing
of
a
50(b)
motion
would
seem
to
be
contrary
to
the
generally
accepted
practice
that
attorneys
are
not--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--there
are
several
things
that
we
would
fall
back
on,
your
honor.
when
you
say
"fall
back",
i
assume
that
that
means
if
the
court
were
not
to
follow
the
precedent
of
the
trilogy--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--on
the
meaning
of--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--the
trilogy.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
okay.
under
those
circumstances,
there
were
two
questions.
one
is,
of
course,
plain
error,
and
the
other
is
retroactivity.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
no,
your
honor.
we
have
found
no
case,
either
way--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--on
that.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
it's...
there's
no
precedent
that--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
your
honor,
there
was
another
claim
in
this
case
on
which
unitherm
did
recover,
which
is
not
before
this
court,
which
was
a
claim
for--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--sure.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well,
there's
not--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
in
determining
plain
error,
it's
necessary
to
put
it
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
that
very
issue
had
been
raised
repeatedly
and
had,
in
fact,
been
ruled
on
by
the
court
in
denying
the
summary
judgment
motion.
so,
we
weren't
dealing
with
someone
who
was
naive
in
this
respect.
we
were
dealing
with
someone
who
had
faced
this
precise
issue,
and
the
very
closely
related
issue
of
antitrust
standing,
which
focuses
on
antitrust
injury.
so,
we
got
to
this
point
in
the
trial.
we
had
a
great
deal
of
history--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
certainly
the
plain
error
argument
is
always,
in
a
sense,
available,
your
honor.
but
i
do
think
this
is
an
extreme
case,
and
i
think
that's
reflected
by
what
the
federal
circuit
said,
that
i
read
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument.
but
that's
extremely
strong.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
it's
an
extreme
case
for
a
number
of
reasons,
and
that's
certainly
one
of
them.
there
isn't
just
insufficient--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--evidence,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--no,
but
in...
this
is
a...
an...
a
case
in
which
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
extremely
apparent.
these
parties--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
your
honor,
certainly
where
the
motion
has
been
made
and
has,
in
fact,
been
briefed,
and
has
been
considered
by
the
court,
and
where
you
have
a
situation
in
which--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well,
your
honor,
i
guess
we'd
go
back
to
the
proposition
that...
i
believe
that
the
district
court
could
grant
the
50(a)
motion
later;
it
did
not
have
to
wait
for
50(b)
motion.
and,
in
fact,
it
is
a
very
common
practice--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
certainly
in
situations
where
the
court
simply
enters
judgment
and
doesn't
deny
the
motion
first,
that
would
be
true--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--would
be
true.
but--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--even
here--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
your
honor,
i...
when
it
comes
to
"overruling
a
lot
of
law",
i
think
that
the
fundamental
fact
here
is
that,
in
the
trilogy,
the
case
was
always
sent
back
for
a
new
trial.
never
was
judgment
entered
in
favor
of
the
party
that
had
failed
to
prove
its
case.
so--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--that's
correct.
sent
back--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--to
the
district--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--court.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well,
the...
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
district
court.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
affirm
that
and
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court,
as
a
federal
circuit
ruled.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--i--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--if
you
look
at
50(a),
your
honor,
it
specifically
says
that
the
50(a)
motion
can
be
granted.
now,
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
a
view
of
the
rule
that
says
that
the
only
remedies
available
are
set
forth
in
section
(b)
and
triggered
by
the
renewal
of
the
motion.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
if
the
motion
is
reserved,
and
the
court
has
declined
to
rule
on
it,
then
the...
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
follows
that
the
court
can
grant
that
motion.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
well,
it
can
also
enter
judgment,
which
constitutes
another
denial--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--yes.
most
certainly.
because--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--it
is
a--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--it
is
a
lesser
remedy--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--than
the
one
requested,
that
was--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
rule
50(a)
doesn't
literally
say
that
the
motion
can
be
denied.
it
simply
says
that
it
can
be
granted.
but
i
think
we
have
to
infer
from
that,
that
it
can
be
denied.
and
i
would
equally
infer
that
a
lesser
remedy
is
possible
once
the
50(a)
motion
is
made.
but
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
read
the
rule
as
saying
that
the
only
way
these
remedies
are
available
is
through
a
50(b)
motion,
because
that's
inconsistent
with
the
provision
that
the
motion
can
be
granted
under
50(a).
the...
it,
further,
seems
to
me
that
if
the...
if
the
motion
is...
if
decision
on
the
motion
is
deemed
to
be
had...
to
have
been
deferred,
then
that
motion
is
still
before
the
court,
even
if
the
court
has
denied
it.
and
the
court
can
grant
it
later
on--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--instead
of
interjecting--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
i
would
have
stopped
sooner,
your
honor.
i
would
have
said,
"i
will
take
it
under
advisement.
"
that
is
really
the
essence
of
the
rule,
that
the
court
has
this
under
advisement.
and
it
is
a
very
common--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
certainly
a
common
practice
that,
while
the--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
ruling
on
that
motion--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--had
been
inferred--
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
--no,
i'm...
i'm
very
pleased
to
answer
the
question,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
rule
permits
the
judge
to
decide
the
50(a)
motion
at
any
time
prior
to
entering
judgment.
and
the
judge
can
change
his
or
her
mind
on
that
at
any
time,
because
the
issue
is
still
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
schroeder
thank
you,
your
honor.
