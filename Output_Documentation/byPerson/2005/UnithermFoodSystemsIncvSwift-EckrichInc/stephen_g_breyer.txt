g.

so
far,
you're
halfway
into
your
argument.
i
thought
the
basic
question
here
was,
first,
whether
a
court
of
appeals,
or
anybody,
can
grant
a
j...
what
used
to
be
called
the
jnov
without
your
making
its...
whatever
it's
called
now...
and
without
somebody
making
a
motion.
and
from
your
not
opposing
that,
i
guess
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
of
course
not.
of
course
you
have
to
make
a
motion.
you
have
to
make
a
motion
for
everything.
the
judge
is
not
a
genius.
he
can't...
is
not
a
mindreader.
and
if
you
don't
make
a
motion,
you
lose.
okay?
now,
is
there
any
argument
against
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i...
i
mean,
i
thought...
there
are
two
parts
to
this.
question
one
is,
can
you
possibly
get
a
judgment...
what
used
to
be
called
a
jnov
or
a
jmol
or
whatever...
from
the
court
of
appeals,
when
you
didn't
make
a
motion
for
it,
after
the
jury
came
in,
in
the
district
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
say,
"of
course
you
have
to
make
a
motion.
"
and,
so
far,
i've
heard
no
response
whatsoever
to
what
i'd
think
is
a
fairly
basic
question
in
this
case.
and
i'm
assuming:
of
course
you
have
to
make
a
motion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
even
if
there
were,
how
could
this
kind
of
error
ever
be
plain?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
ever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
there's
no
evidence
at
all.
you
have
a
patent,
and
a
patent
is
a
monopoly.
and
so,
what...
obviously,
it
monopolizes
a
market,
it
monopolizes
the
market
of
a
patent.
and
you'd
have
to
be
a
genius
in
antitrust
law
to
know
something's
wrong
with
that
argument.
and
so,
how
could
it
all
be
plain?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
were
saying
that
the
mistake
was
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
that
there
was
injury
of
an
antitrust
kind,
and
that
there
was
a
market.
so,
i'm
saying
a
person
who
knows
a
little,
but
not
a
lot,
of
antitrust
law
would
think,
"obviously,
there's
a
market
here.
"
"there's
the
market
covered
by
the
patent.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
obviously,
there's
injury,
because
a
patent
allows
you
to
raise
the
price.
end
of
the
matter.
now,
that's
naive,
but
somebody
who
doesn't
know
antitrust
law
thoroughly
couldn't
possibly
think
that
there
is
plain
error
here.
what's
the
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
worried
about,
to
put
all
my
cards
on
the
table...
if
we
were
to
say
there
is
even
a
possibility
of
plain
error
in
this
case,
the
plain
error
exception
in
the
rules
would
become
a
monster,
wherein
complex
cases,
people
who
hadn't
made
the
proper
motions
would
all
be
arguing
plain
error
just
as
if
they
had.
