chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
04-1528,
randall
v.
sorrell,
and
the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
bopp.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
with
respect
to
the
contribution
limits,
what...
what
makes
this
case
different
from
the...
the
shrink
pac
case
from
a
few
years
ago?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
it...
you
think
it's
the
dollar
amounts
that
are
involved?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
sorrell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel,
you...
you
say
in
your
brief...
i'm
reading
from
page
13...
that
the
record
convincingly
shows
that
the
ties
among
donor
groups
and
elected
officials
often
determine
the
positions
officials
take.
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
an
official
who
took
a
position
because
of
the
ties
to
donor
groups?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
position
is
that
that
official's
official
positions
were
determined
by
the
donor
groups,
as
you
say
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
brief
says
determined.
and
did...
did
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
it
should
say
influenced
rather
than
determined.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
many
prosecutions
for
political
corruption
have
you
brought?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
that
political
corruption
in
vermont
is
a
serious
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
you
describe
your
state
as
a
clean
state
politically
or
as
a
corrupt
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
they
can...
and
presumably
they
act
accordingly
at
the
polls.
if
they
think
someone
has
been
bought,
i
assume
they
don't
reelect
the
person.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is...
is
an
affidavit
from
the
candidate
enough
credible
evidence
in
your
view?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
wright.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--when
you
look
at
the...
the
record,
vermont
would
be
the
last
place
that
you'd
be
worried
about
it.
the
political
culture,
as
we
just
heard,
is
that
it's
easy
to
go
door
to
door,
and
that's
what
the
vermonters
expect.
and
it
doesn't
take
an
arms
race
to
get
on
your
feet
and
go
door
to
door.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
real
dilemma
on
the
respondents'
side
of
the
case
between
justifying
low
limits
by
saying
you
don't
really
need
money
to
run
effectively
and
at
the
same
time
suggesting
that
there's
a
serious
problem
with
too
much
money.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you...
how
do
you
police
that,
though?
because
an
incumbent
can...
has
so
many
opportunities
to
go
before
the
public
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be
categorized
as
campaigning
but
as
part
of
his
or
her
official
duties,
while
everything
a
challenger
does
is
going
to
be
credited
against
his
account.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
may
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bopp,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
announcement
in
04-1528,
randall
versus
sorrell,
and
the
consolidated
cases.
