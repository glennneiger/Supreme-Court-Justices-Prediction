justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
he's
thinking
in...
he
sometimes
thinks
in
the
past.
he's--
[laughter]
he's
translated
it
into
1974
or
'72
real
dollars.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
$200.
the
same
question
or
$201.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
have
the
same
question
justice
scalia
had.
i
mean,
the...
the
question
is
you...
you
have
limits
here
of
$100
per
election.
it's
$200
per
cycle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
a
house.
$300
for
the
senate,
$400
for
a
candidate
for
statewide
office,
including
the
governor.
that's
$200
for
an
election
for
governor.
you
throw
in
contributions
in
kind.
you
say
that
the
political
parties
themselves
cannot
give
more
than
that
$200
for
an
election
for
the
governor.
if
we
translated
those
into
1974
dollars,
they're
just
the
numbers
justice
scalia
mentioned,
and
i
would
like
to
know
why
are
they...
why
does
not
give
incumbents
a
tremendous
advantage,
that
if
you
have
the
incumbent
plus
a
newspaper,
it's
hopeless,
that
there's
no
way
of
spending
as
a
challenger.
in
other
words,
why
aren't
these
limits
far
too
low?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
going
to
help
to
say
incumbents
had
a
bigger
advantage
before.
that
is,
the
question
is,
what
we're
interested
in
is...
at
least
what
i've
written
that
i'm
interested
in,
is
at
what
point
do
these
become
so
low
that
they
really,
as
a
significant
matter,
shut
off
the
possibility
of
a
challenge.
and
from
that
point
of
view,
your
numbers,
which
do
not
tell
me
the
expenditures
in
a
competitive
district,
and
your
numbers,
which
do
not
explain
all
the
problems
that
judge
winter
had
with
these
things,
do
not
help.
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
the
expenditure.
i'm
talking
about
the
contribution
limits.
i
and
my
friends
have
the
following
thought.
we
don't
know
who
the
candidates
for
state
rep
are,
but
we
want
a
republican
slate
or
we
want
a
democratic
slate.
so
we
get
all
our
$5
together,
give
them
to
the
democratic
party
or
the
republican
party
in
vermont,
and
lo
and
behold,
that
party
cannot
give
more
than
$100
in
an
election
to
a
state
rep,
et
cetera.
now,
to
the...
to
the
ear,
that
sounds
as
if
a
challenger
or
a
slate
of
challengers
or
a
party
that
wants
to
challenge
is
going
to
have
a
really
tough
time.
so
i
want
you
to
explain
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
can
i
ask
a
technical
question
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just...
is...
is
it
the
case
or
not
the
case
that
if
i
contribute
my
car
to
drive
the
candidate
for
governor,
let's
say,
between
burlington
and
montpelier,
and
i
buy
the
gas,
does
that
count
against
the
limit?
yes
or
no.
i'm
a
volunteer
and
i
buy
gas
and
drive
him
back
and
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
he
drives.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
there.
i
lent
him
the
car.
[laughter]
okay.
i
got
the
idea.
if
he
does...
if
i
do,
it's
not.
what
about
i
have
a
coffee...
coffee.
i
wanted
to
get
the
line.
i
see
it.
coffee.
i
want
to
have
coffee
and
donuts,
free
donuts
because...
and
coffee
for
people
to
come
in.
is
that
counted
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
it's
$200.
coffee
and
donuts
are
expensive.
[laughter]
okay?
count
it
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
donuts
and
coffee.
in
other
words,
it
counts
as
long
as
it's
over
$100.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
$100.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
counts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
your
question...
the...
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--wasn't
it
the
state
auditor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
know,
but
didn't
we
have
in
front
of
us
a
limit,
which
i
wrote
was
rather
border,
that
involved
a
state
auditor
campaign?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
so,
in
shrink
missouri.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
not
quite
the
same
political
volatility
perhaps,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
have
a
different
question
i'd
like
to
ask
you
which
i
haven't
heard
addressed
yet.
on
the
expenditure
limits,
there
is
a
case,
buckley
v.
valeo,
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
expenditure
limits
are
not
constitutional.
now,
whether
i
agree
with
that
or
don't
agree
with
that,
am
i
not
bound
by
that?
and
insofar
as
you
try
to
distinguish
it,
you've
read
what
judge
winter
said
about
your
efforts
to
distinguish
it.
and
therefore,
i'd
like
to
hear
why
you
think
i'm
not
bound
by
a
past
precedent
in
an
important
matter,
with
which
i
may
or
may
not
have
agreed
at
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
going
to
announce
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
this
case,
which
is
that
vermont's
campaign-finance
law
violates
the
first
amendment.
there
are
six
people
who
think
that
conclusion,
but
they
think
it
for
quite
different
reasons,
and
so
i
am
announcing
an
opinion,
in
which
the
chief
justice
joins
in
whole
and
justice
alito
joins
in
part.
now,
there
are
two
parts
to
this
law.
the
first
part
has
to
do
with
expenditure
limits.
it
tells
the
governor,
“you
can’t
spend
more
than
$300,000,”
and
the
limits
go
down
so
that
for
a
state
rep
it
is
$2,000.
so
the
first
part
is
expenditure
limits;
and
the
second
part
is
contribution
limits
--
that
is
on
individual
and
party
contributions
to
a
candidate
--
and
those
limits
vary
from
$400
for
an
individual
or
a
party
for
a
particular
candidate
for
governor
down
to
$200
for
a
state
rep.
well,
i
overstate,
because
in
fact
those
limits
are
not
$400;
they
are
for
two
elections,
the
primary
and
the
final,
so
really
it
is
closer
to
$200,
depending
on
how
you
allocate
it
for
governor,
and
$100
for
state
rep.
and
those
limits
apply
also
to
political
parties
if
they
want
to
give
some
money
to
the
candidate,
and
they
also
apply
to
contributions
in
kind.
well,
we
first
have
to
consider
the
expenditure
limits,
and
on
the
expenditure
limits
--
but,
remember,
i
am
speaking
just
for
the
chief
justice
and
myself
--
we
think
there
was
a
case,
buckley
versus
valeo,
a
very
well-known
case,
and
that
case
said
that
expenditure
limits
violate
the
first
amendment,
but
contribution
limits
do
not.
well,
we
are
considering
expenditure
limits,
and
in
our
view
this
vermont
statute
on
the
expenditure-limit
side
is
unconstitutional
because
of
stare
decisis,
and
we
elaborate
that
a
bit
in
the
opinion
and
we
see
no
good
reason
for
departing
from
stare
decisis
in
respect
to
expenditure
limits.
then
the
parties
have
argued
another
point
in
respect
to
expenditure
limits.
that
point
is
that,
well,
what
they
did
not
think
of
in
buckley
v.
valeo
is
once
you
have
contribution
limits,
it
takes
a
lot
more
time
for
a
candidate
to
raise
money,
and
that
is
a
problem;
but
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
problem
they
did
not
think
of;
that
is,
at
the
time
of
buckley
v.
valeo,
that
was
pointed
out
to
the
court,
and
also
we
think
it
is
fairly
obvious
that
once
you
have
low
contribution
limits,
a
candidate
will
have
to
spend
more
time
to
raise
an
equivalent
amount
of
money.
so
we
do
not
really
see
anything
new
there.
and
in
that
part
of
the
opinion,
i
am
joined
by
both
the
chief
justice
and
justice
alito.
now,
we
turn
to
the
contribution
limits.
now,
contribution
limits
are
difficult,
and
the
reason
they
are
difficult
under
buckley
v.
valeo
and
our
cases
is
the
following:
with
a
contribution
limit,
it
is
not
the
case
the
lower
the
better,
in
our
view.
the
reason
it
is
not
the
case
the
lower
the
better
is
because
what
you
are
trying
to
do
is
produce
a
fair
electoral
contest
and
to
sort
of
ward
off
various
things
that
might
impede
the
fairness
of
that
contest.
well,
no
limits
at
all,
in
the
judgment
of
the
legislature,
would
impede
that
because
of
corruption
or
appearance
of
corruption;
but
if
you
get
too
low,
you
can
give
the
incumbent
a
major
advantage,
because
the
incumbent
has
name
recognition,
the
incumbent
is
well-known
to
the
press.
and
therefore
it
is
not
the
case,
in
our
view,
the
lower
the
better.
rather,
if
you
really
see
first
amendment
interests
on
both
sides
of
this
equation,
there
must
be
a
lower
limit
somewhere.
does
this
vermont
statute
go
below
the
lower
limit?
well,
we
think
that
--
and
here,
i
am
joined
by
the
chief
and
justice
alito
throughout
--
we
think
that
the
legislature
has
a
lot
of
leeway
in
defining
those
lower
limits,
but
at
some
point
they
go
too
far.
we
have
looked
at
this
closely.
why
closely?
because
on
its
face,
the
limit
in
front
of
us,
say,
$200
or
$100,
depending
on
how
you
count
it,
that
would
be
way,
way,
way
lower
than
the
limit
in
buckley
ever
was.
that
limit
was
$1,000
in
the
early
1970s
for
a
congressional
seat.
$1,000
in
1970,
if
you
translate
the
limits
here
back
to
the
limits
in
buckley,
i.e.,
you
adjust
for
inflation,
you
get
about
$56.
and
so
this
is
about
5%
of
what
they
were
in
buckley.
that,
it
is
the
lowest
in
the
nation
if
you
look
at
it
all
in
total,
all
in
total,
and
certainly
the
lowest
we
have
considered.
lowest
in
the
nation
is
arguable,
but
lowest
we
have
considered
is
not
arguable.
so
we
have
looked
at
it
carefully.
and
here,
basically,
is
what
we
found.
first,
the
record
suggests,
though
it
does
not
conclusively
prove,
that
the
low
contribution
limits
of
$200
or
$400
will
significantly
restrict
the
amount
of
funding
available
for
challengers
to
run
competitive
campaigns.
there
were
petitioner’s
experts
in
the
trial
court,
and
they
tried
to
show
that
there
would
be
a
dramatic
lessening,
particularly
in
the
amounts
that
parties
could
give
to
the
candidates;
the
amounts
might
be
cut
that
they
would
have
by
a
third
to
a
half
or
more.
on
the
other
side,
what
they
did
was
try
not
to
refute
the
competitive
campaigns,
but
to
look
at
average
contributions
to
average
campaigns,
funding
in
average
campaigns.
but
the
point
here
is
competitive
campaigns,
because
the
problem
here
is
insulating
the
incumbent
from
a
competitive
challenge.
and
so
we
are
concerned
about
that,
and
that
counts
as
a
factor
against
the
constitutionality
of
the
contribution
limits.
then
turn
to
the
limitation
on
political
parties.
well,
here,
unlike
any
other
statute
we
have
considered,
the
amount
that
a
political
party
can
give
to
a
candidate
from
that
party
is
the
same
as
the
amount
of
an
individual;
it
is
not
some
multiple
of
that.
now,
we
know
that
there
is
a
problem
of
circumventing
individual
limits
by
giving
to
parties;
but
this
statute
pays
no
attention
to
what
is
on
the
other
side.
well,
what
is
on
the
other
side?
well,
these
limits
are
so
low
that,
for
example,
if
the
democratic
party
or
the
republican
party
decides
that
it
would
like
to
have
a
couple
of
meet
the
candidate
for
governor,
meet
our
candidate
for
governor,
coffee
and
doughnuts,
coffee
and
bagels
maybe
they
could
do
it
once
or
twice;
but,
i
mean,
even
in
vermont
--
i
know
vermont
is
a
terrific
state
--
but
i
suspect
that
coffee
and
doughnuts
or
coffee
and
bagels
is
going
to
eat
up,
if
you
have
100
and
200
people
in
that
room,
that
$200
to
$400
pretty
quickly,
and
then
the
party
will
not
be
able
to
pay
for
an
event
to
meet
the
candidate,
let
alone
postage
or
other
things.
but
i’ll
put
that
to
the
side,
because
maybe
they
can
figure
a
way
around
that.
more
importantly
is
this:
suppose
we
have
6,000
people
in
the
state
of
vermont
out
of
a
population
of,
let’s
say,
360,000.
suppose
we
have
6,000
who
reason
as
follows:
i
do
not
know
who
should
be
in
the
state
legislature,
but
i
do
know
one
thing.
i
would
like
a
democrat.
i
would
like
the
democrats
to
control
that
state
legislature.
so
what
i
am
going
to
do
--
the
same
with
republicans
on
the
other
side
--
i
am
going
to
give
$1,
$1
to
the
democratic
party,
1.
that
is
not
an
enormous
amount.
but
with
that
dollar,
i
want
them
to
put
it
in
the
key
races,
so
we
can
have
our
party
controlling
the
legislature.
and
now
suppose
that
the
party
discovers
there
are
three
key
races
where
challenges
really
matter.
could
it
put
that
$6,000
in
those
three
key
races?
no.
2,000
in
each?
it
would
be
limited
to
$200
or
$300.
now,
who
have
you
hurt
there?
you
have
hurt
the
6,000
people,
each
of
whom
wanted
to
give
$1
to
make
certain
that
its
party
controlled
the
state
legislature.
now,
we
are
not
saying
that
there
should
be
circumvention
of
individual
limits;
but
we
think
interests
like
that,
the
state
has
to
pay
some
attention
to
it,
which
it
did
not
here.
and
there
are
more
problems.
the
problem
of
contributions
in
kind
is
a
serious
one.
when
you
have
very
low
limits
and
you
have
volunteers
and
those
volunteers
want
to
drive
a
candidate
around
the
state
use
their
own
gasoline
or
maybe
use
their
own
stamps
or
maybe
use
their
own
postage,
these
low
limits
eat
up
that
postage
amount
or
the
dollar
for
coffee
and
so
forth
pretty
quickly,
and
the
consequence
of
that
is
the
risk
of
campaign
violation;
and
the
risk
of
campaign
violation
is
a
risk
of
very
bad
publicity,
even
if
it
is
a
minor
violation.
so
put
those
together
and
add
one
other
thing:
that
it
is
not
indexed
for
inflation.
so
that
means
that
even
if
we
are
wrong,
eventually
we
would
be
right.
further,
we
could
not
find
any
special
justification
for
this.
so
putting
together
the
very
low
limits
for
the
individual
gifts,
the
same
limits
being
on
the
political
parties,
the
problem
of
contributions
in
kind,
the
fact
that
it
is
not
indexed
for
inflation
and
the
possibility
that
we
could
not
find
any
possibility
of
special
justification,
putting
those
five
things
together,
we
think
that
this
statute
is
lower
than
the
constitutional
bound.
it
is
too
low
on
the
low
side;
therefore,
it
violates
the
first
amendment.
well,
as
i
said,
that
is
just
justice
alito
and
myself
…
and
the
chief
justice.
i
don’t
want
to
forget
that.
all
right.
now,
the
other
opinions,
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
