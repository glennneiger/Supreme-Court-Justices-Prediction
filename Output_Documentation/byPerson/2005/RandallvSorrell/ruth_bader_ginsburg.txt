ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bopp,
would
you
clarify
a
procedural
point?
as
i
understand
it,
on
the
expenditure
issue,
there
is
no
final
decision
that
has
gone
back
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
may...
the
district
court
might...
may
well
find
that
nothing
passes
constitutional
muster
in
the
end.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
arguing
now
then
that
there
may
be
no
limits
on
expenditures?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
were
lower
limits,
mr.
bopp,
and
i
think
that's
what
justice
souter
was
asking
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
were
the
thousand
dollars,
but
i
think
it
went
down
as
low
as
$250
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there...
there
was
a
court
that
subsequently
considered
the
rest
and
upheld
the
contribution--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
bopp,
may
i
ask
you?
you
keep...
the
way
you're
discussing
this
case,
one
would
think
that
the
trial
court
found
there
was
an
evidentiary
insufficiency,
but
i
thought,
at
least
on
the
contributions
part,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
evidence
sufficed
to
justify
those
limits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you...
can
you
point
to
the
place
in
the
district
court
opinion
that
you're
referring
to?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
testimony
or
evidence
on
the
other
side
of
the
point
that
judge
winter
makes?
that
is,
you
have
someone
running
in
a
primary
and
then
faces
an
incumbent
in
the
general
election,
but
there's
nothing
left
in
the
till
because
it
was
a
hard
fought
primary.
that...
the
advantage
to
the
incumbent
in
that
situation
was
a
large
concern
to
at
least
some
of
the
judges
on
the
second
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
on
the
contributions,
is
it?
