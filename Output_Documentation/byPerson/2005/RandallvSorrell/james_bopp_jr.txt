mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
as
this
court
made
clear
recently
in
republican
party
of
minnesota
v.
white,
since
political
candidates
are
the
ones
who
take
office,
it
is
imperative
that
they
be
allowed
freely
to
express
themselves
on
matters
of
current
public
importance.
as
a
result,
this
court
has
never
allowed
the
government
to
prohibit
candidates
from
communicating
relevant
information
to
voters
during
an
election.
vermont,
however,
has
adopted
low
expenditure
and
contribution
limits
for
the
opposite
purpose,
reducing
overall
candidate
campaign
spending,
and
these
limits
would
have
that
effect.
this
is
fundamentally
incompatible
with
any
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment
and
is
not
justified
by
any
truly
compelling
governmental
interest.
as
a
result,
they
are
unconstitutional.
now,
vermont's
expenditure
limits
are
an
unprecedented,
direct
restraint
on
candidate
speech.
once
these
low
expenditure
limits
are
exhausted,
a
candidate
may
not
drive
to
the
village
green
to
address
a
rally,
may
not
return
the
phone
call
from
a
reporter
at
the
local
newspaper,
and
may
not
call
a
neighbor
to
urge
her
to
get
out
to
vote.
this
court
has
never
allowed
the
government
to
prohibit
candidates
from
communicating
this
sort
of
relevant
information
during
a
campaign.
further,
this
court
has
long
held
that
more
speech
is
better
than
less
speech.
as
long
as
contribution
limits
are
available
to
address
any
realistic
concerns
about
corruption,
the
public
will
benefit
from
candidates'
being
allowed
to
spend
all
that
they
can
lawfully
raise
in
their
campaign.
now,
the
record
is
clear
in
this
case
that
the
expenditure
limits
will
deprive
candidates
of
substantial
resources.
the
district
court
erroneously
looked
at
average
spending
over
the
last
three
elections
and
found
that
in
all
but
one
category,
that
is,
senate
candidates
running
in
single
member
districts,
that
the
average
spending
for
all
candidates
in
those
campaigns
were
below
the
limits
set
by
the
expenditure
limits
in
vermont.
however,
in
buckley,
the
last
case
for...
where
this
court
considered
candidate
expenditure
limits,
the
court
looked
at
the
number
of
races
affected,
not
the
average
spending
in
all
races.
and
in
buckley,
the
court
looked
at
the
expenditures
in
u.s.
senate
races
and
found
that
in
previous
election,
that
26
percent
were
over
the
mandatory
expenditure
limits
considered
in
buckley,
and
in
the
house,
3
percent
of
the
races
had
spending
greater
than
the...
these
limits.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
there
were...
that
is
correct,
that
there
is
a
remand.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
they
could
potentially,
yes.
however,
the...
the
second
circuit
did...
did
make
decisions
of
law.
they
found
that
these
two
interests
that
the
state
is
alleging,
that
is,
in
preventing
corruption
and
in
conserving
incumbent
time,
were
together
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
and
we...
we
allege
that
they
are
not
and
that
on
this
record,
this
court
can
determine
that
they
are
not...
they
are
not
together
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
the...
this
court
has
now
considered,
including
this
case,
a
dozen
times
in
which
the
government
has
sought
to
limit
expenditures,
either
of
candidates
or
pac's
or
political
parties,
and
despite
the
work
of
the
most
brilliant
lawyers
in
the
united
states,
they
have
not
come
up
with
any
compelling
governmental
interest
that
this
court
has
accepted.
and
we
believe
that
this
record
demonstrates
that
these
claimed
interests
either
are
not
compelling
or
are
not
proven.
now--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
we...
we
are
asserting
that
that
is
not
a
compelling
interest
in
and
of
itself,
and
this
court
should
reject
it.
i...
i
just
don't
see--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
and
in
addition...
well,
the...
the
point
about
it
not
being
a
compelling
interest
i
think
is
an
analytical
point
that
doesn't
have
to
be...
that
doesn't
rest
on
this...
strictly
on
this
record.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
if
it
were
a
compelling
interest,
there's
no
record
here
that
is
a
problem
in
vermont.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
i
don't
see
how
it
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
to
limit
challengers
to
only
fund
raise
to
the
extent
that
an
incumbent
finds
comfortable
or
convenient.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
it
is
a
self
justifying
statute
by
imposing
the
lowest
contribution
limits
in...
in
the
nation,
adjusted
for
inflation
for
1974
dollars,
when
the
$1,000
limit
was
approved.
this
is
a
contribution
limit
of
$50
for
an--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it's
not
a
matter
of
just
access.
it
has
to
be
a
matter
of
privileged
access
that
this
court
found
in
the--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
if
it...
if
it's
privileged--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--indeed,
and
in
fact,
the...
there
are
other
less
restrictive
ways
of...
of
dealing
with
this.
for...
for
instance,
vermont
prohibits
contributions
from
lobbyists
during
the
session.
other
legislatures
have
imposed
a
prohibition
on
incumbents
from
raising
any
money
during
the
time
the
legislative
session...
the
legislature
is
in
session.
so
there
are
ways
of
dealing
with
the
question
of
access
that
are
not
the
blunderbuss
approach
here.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
that.
but
certainly
the
press
and
opponents
often,
you
know,
point
to
examples
where
they
believe
that
their
challenger
is
under
too
much
of
an
influence
of
a
particular
entity,
and
the
voters,
you
know,
in
certain
circumstances
take
that
into
account
in
their
voting.
and
furthermore,
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
general
cynicism
about
politicians
and
government
that
has
existed
since
the
first
colonists
came
to
our
country
and
continues
today.
in
fact,
our
governmental
system
is
established
on
the
proposition
that
we
need
to
limit
the...
the
government,
and
we
need
to
have
checks
and
balances
because
we
don't
want
free
rein
by
politicians
because
we
are
concerned
about
their
exercise
of
power.
but
if
this
is
enough--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
because
there
have
been
legal
findings
by
the
second
circuit
that
we
believe
are
erroneous.
the...
the
first,
as
i
mentioned
previously,
is
that...
that
we
do
not
believe
that
the...
preserving
incumbents'
time
through
expenditure
limits
can
ever
be
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
to
limit
what
challengers
can
spend...
raise
and
spend
in
their
own
election.
i
mean,
this
interest...
the
expenditure
limits
don't
apply
just
to
incumbents
who...
if
there
is
a
concern
about--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--i
have
a...
a
very
difficult
time
justifying
expenditure
limits.
i
know
there's
a
debate
on
this
court
on
whether
or
not
there
are
per
se
situations
under
the
first
amendment.
if
there
was
ever
a
candidate
for
a
per
se
first
amendment
ban
on
a
law,
surely
it
would
be
this
type
of
case.
in
other
words,
we
are
talking
about
speech
that
is
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment,
and
secondly,
we
are
talking
about
candidate
speech.
candidates
are
the
ones
that
go
into
office.
they
are
the
ones
that
are
going
to
be
exercising
governmental
power.
these
low
expenditure
and
contribution
limits
would
have
the
effect
of
making
candidates
a
bit
player
in
their
own
election
so
that
the
voters--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
several
things.
first
is
there
was
actually
a
paucity
of
evidence
in
the
shrink
pac
case.
there
was
only
an
allegation
of
one
pac
that
wanted
to
give
one
contribution
to
one
candidate,
and
this
court
said
that,
you
know,
you
didn't
need
a
lot
of
evidence
to
combat
such
a
weak...
weak
claim.
so
secondly
is
the
novelty
and
plausibility
of
a...
adjusted
for
per
election
in
1974
dollars
of
a
$50
contribution
limit,
that
that
would
actually
give
rise
to
realistic
concern
about
actual
and
perceived
corruption.
so,
again,
in
shrink
pac--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
one
of
the
decisions
that
the
court
has
to
make
under
your
jurisprudence
is
that...
that
contribution
limits
can
only
eliminate
large
contributions
that
give
rise
to
this
realistic
perception
or
actuality
of
corruption.
so
it
is...
whether
it's
large
or
not
and
giving
rise
to
that
concern
because
of
the
size,
that
is
an
integral
part
of
the
shrink
analysis.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
it
depends
on
how
you...
you
compute
it.
the--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--the...
well,
certainly
what
the...
what
the
evidence
was
in
shrink
was
it
was
a
$1,075
limit,
again
adjusted
for
inflation,
was
about
$375
adjusted
for
inflation
compared
to
the
buckley
limits,
and
because
of
the
paucity
of
evidence
and
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
really
novel
to
say
that
a
$1,000
limit
could
give
rise
to
corruption
because--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
well,
the...
the
contribution
limits
that
this
court
considered
was
the
$1,075--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes,
there
was.
the
eighth
circuit
did
so
and
the...
the
lowest
limit
there
was
$275
per
election,
which
would
be
$500
for...
for
the...
the
entire
election
cycle.
and
the...
and...
but
really
that...
that
was
on
a...
a
record
that
this
court
found
to
be,
frankly,
inadequate
to...
to
raise
any
serious
questions
about
the...
whether
the
amounts
concerned
gave
rise
to
a
realistic
threat
of
corruption.
and
the
record
here
demonstrates
that...
that
the...
that
the
only
time
really
there
is
a
actuality
or
perception
of
corruption
in
vermont
is
when
they...
is
when
we're
talking
about
amounts
in
excess
of
$1,000.
that
was
the
prior
limit.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no.
and,
you
know,
we
had
a
10-day
trial.
we
had
numerous
witnesses
here.
the...
shrink
had
been
decided.
i
mean,
there
was...
everything
was
before
the
court
to
consider
the...
the
matter.
and
so,
you
know,
they
had
their
chance
at...
at
proof.
and...
and
in
the
numerous
witnesses,
they
made
their
best
case.
they
could
not
identify
one
single
politician
in
vermont
that
was...
that
anyone
would...
would
claim
was
corrupted
in
any
way
by
a
contribution...
by
contributions
under
$1,000.
they
could
not
name
one
single
incumbent
politician
in
vermont
that
neglected
any
specific
duty
that
he
or
she
had.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
if--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well...
well,
they
at
least
have
to
give,
you
know,
realistic
circumstances.
they
gave
a
few
circumstances--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
the...
the
responsibility
that
shrink
imposes
is
to...
to
demonstrate
both
actual
and
perceived
corruption
at
that
the--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--if
it's
just
anecdotal,
no.
it
has
to
be--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
the...
if
it's
isolated
examples
that
are
unconnected
to
any
perception
of
corruption
at
that
level,
then
it
would
not
be
adequate
on...
on
its...
on
its...
by
itself.
now,
of
course,
in
shrink,
the
court
cited
to
both
actual
and
perceived
evidence
of
corruption
at
the
level
that
the...
you
were
considering
that
limit.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
this
court
has
never
approved
restrictions
on
fundamental
first
amendment
values
based
purely
upon
speculation
or
concern
about
something
that's
happening
some
other
place.
in
other
words,
these
are
real
limits
on
people
in
vermont,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
approve
the
lowest
contribution
limits
in
the
nation
and
these
very
low
expenditure
limits,
the
state
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
vermont
is
the
most
corrupt
state
in
the
nation.
and
they're
far
from
it.
in
fact,
the
opposite--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--nor
corruptible.
the...
the
evidence
is
quite
clear.
even
in
the
few
examples
that
they
cite
to
like
the
tobacco
industry
passing
out
$40
checks
after
a...
a
vote
defeating
a
bill.
of
course,
that's
still
legal
under
this...
this
act.
but,
you
know,
even
pointing
out
that
they...
that
the
person
who
talked
about
that
example
made
it
clear
that
he
didn't
believe
anybody
was...
was
influenced
by
post
contributions
after
a
vote
regarding
a
matter
that's
not
even
prohibited
by
this...
by
this
act.
so
it
was...
it
was
a
lot
of
testimony
about
how
truly
clean
vermont
is,
not
the
most
corrupt,
where
people...
politicians
would
be
tempted
at
these
quite
low
limits
to,
you
know,
sell
their
honor
and...
and
personal,
you
know...
and
their...
and
affect
their
own,
you
know,
personal
character
and
reputation.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
the
key
would
be
if
it's
mandated,
voluntary--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--if
it
was
mandated,
yes,
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
oh,
yes.
well,
there
would
be
a
prohibition
in
that
case
if
i
understand
your--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--on...
on
contributions,
and
there
would
be
also
a...
a
mandatory
expenditure
limit
because
you
could
only
spend
what
the
government
gave
you.
so
that
would
have
all
those
features.
now,
if
it
was,
of
course,
voluntary,
it
would
solve
the...
the
two
problems
that...
that
the
state
talks
about
because
if
you
have
a
voluntary
public
funding
system...
and
this
is,
again,
why
remand
is...
is
inappropriate.
you
don't
need
to
go
back
and...
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
legislature
considered
providing
adequate
public
funds.
i
mean,
it's
whether
that
alternative
exists.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
there
would
be
an
absolute
prohibition,
and
this
court
in...
in
beaumont
reserved
that
question
of
whether
or
not
an
absolute
prohibition...
and...
and
then
in
mcconnell,
you
struck
down
the
absolute
prohibition
on
minors'
contributing
to
campaigns.
so,
yes,
there
would
be
a
absolute
prohibition
on
any
way
for
any
individual
to
associate
with
a
campaign
through
a
contribution.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and...
and
in
the
record
below,
plaintiff
donald
brunelle
said
that
he
was
prepared
to
spend
considerable
sums
in
support
of
his
state
senate
election,
which...
and
considerable
sums
above
the
expenditure
limits
that
were
before...
that
were
adopted
by
vermont.
so
the...
the
question
is
an
independent--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
nor...
nor
on
fund
raising
using
up
your
time
because
all
a
wealthy
person
has
to
do
is
write
a
check.
and...
and,
of
course,
in
vermont,
they
even
have
an
exception
for
not
only
just
the
wealthy...
wealthy
candidate,
but
the
wealthy
family.
so,
you
know--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
to
a
third
degree
of
consanguinity,
people
who
are
related
to
you
to
that
degree
are
not
subject
to
the
contribution
limit.
so,
you
know,
it's
hard
to
justify
vermont's
scheme
if
you're
concerned
about
the
influence
of
the
wealthy
because
they're
giving
the
wealthy
carte
blanche
to
fund
their
own
campaigns,
even
under
these
limits.
so
a
wealthy
person
who
runs
for
governor...
he
has
no
fund
raising
costs.
so...
and...
and
he
can
get
contributions
from
others
that
are
related
by
blood,
but
not
by
marriage,
interestingly,
to...
to
him.
so
the
public
funding
or
the
expenditures
by...
by
the
wealthy
neither
give
rise
to...
and
both
solve...
either
don't
give
rise
or
solve
the
problems
that
they
claim.
so
there's...
there's...
you
don't
need
a
remand
to
consider
that...
that
question,
and
that
is
one
of
the
questions
that
the
second
circuit
has
asked
that...
that
the
matter
be
remanded
for.
now,
in
addition,
the
expenditure
and
contribution
limits
here
are
not
going
to
allow
even
effective
campaigns.
we
have
considerable
evidence
in
the
record
that
to
run
an
effective
campaign
for
governor
in
vermont,
it
takes
$600,000
to
$800,000;
for
the
senate--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--they
did,
but
erroneously,
and
i...
we
believe
that
you
have
a
responsibility
to
do
an
independent
examination
of
the
record.
for
instance,
there
was
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
these
amounts
were,
quote,
suspiciously
large.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
record
and
you
look
at
the
six
individuals--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--the
contribution
limits...
amounts
over
the
contribution
limits
for--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--i
am
sorry.
i
do
not
have
that
in
front
of
me.
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
amounts
prohibited
under
the
contribution
limits
by
vermont
were,
quote,
suspiciously
large,
and
then
they
cited
six
different
witnesses.
we
have
reviewed
each...
in
our
reply,
each
one
of
those
witnesses,
and
it
is
simply
not
true
that
any
of
them
said
that
it
was
suspiciously
large,
that
is,
that
if
there
was
any
relationship
between
contributions
between
the
old
limits
of
$1,000
per
election
and
these
new,
much...
much
lower
limits,
if
there
was
any...
any
witness
related
contributions
of
that
size
to
any
threat
of
corruption.
in
fact,
in
the
examples
that
are
given,
they
disclaim
that
there
was
any...
that
anybody
was
bought
or
influenced
in
any
way
by
the
contributions
that
were
made.
now,
the...
in
terms
of
an
effective
campaign,
of
course,
under
shrink
if
a
expenditure...
if
a
contribution
limit
amounts
to
an
expenditure
limit...
and
the
court
commented
on
this.
this
court
commented
on
this
in...
in
citizens
against
rent
control
v.
berkeley.
if
a
contribution
limit
acts
as
an
expenditure
limit,
then
it
can...
it
will
be
also
be
struck
down
if
the
candidates
cannot
mount
effective
campaigns.
and
here
we
have
demonstrated
in
the
record
what
an
effective
campaign
amounts
to,
and
the
amounts
even
for
the
house
district
of
$2,000
would
be
simply
used
up
by
1
brochure,
100
yard
signs,
and
1
postcard
mailing.
all
of
these
have
been
valued
in
the
record,
and
that
would
amount
to
$1,500
to
$2,000,
almost
the
entire
amount
allowed,
not
allowing
even
one
mailing
to
all
voters
in...
in
that
house
district.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
thank
you.
the
one
example
that
they
keep
going
back
to
regarding
the
president
of
the
senate
tells
the
breadth
of
this
challenge.
as
long
as
vermont
allows
periodic
elections,
incumbents
are
going
to
consider
the
effect
that
their
votes
have
on
future
elections.
and...
and
while
it
makes
it
more
scandalous
to
say
we
will
lose
the
food
manufacturers'
money,
what
they
are
concerned
about
is
losing
the
food
manufacturers'
support.
so
as...
if
this
the
definition
of
corruption,
it
is
sufficient
now
to...
for
the
state
of
vermont
to
abolish
elections
generally.
now,
secondly,
as
to
the
effect
on
challengers,
the
record
demonstrates
that
challengers...
and
there's
expert
testimony
to
the
fact
that
challengers
are
more
frequently
challenged
in
primaries
than
are
incumbents,
and
the
randall
brief
on
pages
16
and
17
point
out
the
testimony
of
people
who
have
been
subject
to
a
primary
and
demonstrates
that
they
are
not
able
to
mount
an
effective
campaign
in
the
general.
furthermore,
the
expenditure
limits
have
the
perverse
result
of
depriving
challengers
of
more
money
than
incumbents,
probably
making
them
attractive
to
incumbents.
in
the
senate,
for
instance,
incumbents
would
be
deprived
of
20
percent
of
their
total
resources,
while
challengers
would
be
deprived
of
36
percent
of
their
total
resources.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
it
comes
about
because
challengers
frequently
in
vermont
actually
spend
more
than
do
incumbents.
i...
i
know
that...
that
the
general
perception
is
the
opposite,
but
the
general
perception
is
not
true
in
vermont.
and...
and
that
points
to
the...
the
fact
that
the
way
this
law
is
constructed
strongly
suggests
that
is...
it
is
seeking
to
favor
incumbents.
furthermore,
we
had
expert
witness
testimony
on
the
effect
of
contribution
limits
on
competitive
races.
the...
we
had...
mr.
mcneil
testified
in
examining
the
competitive
races
in
the
1998
election
that
the
vast
majority
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
would
not
be
able
to
mount
an
effective
campaign
with
the
available
resources
that
would
have
been
available
after
imposing
the
contribution
limits.
and,
of
course,
these
were
in
the
amounts
of
28
percent
in
the
senate,
22
percent
in
the
house,
which
is
way
beyond
the
5.1
percent
that
this
court
in
buckley
thought
that
could
be
made
up
by
the
imposition
of
a
$1,000
limit.
i
mean,
this...
this
law
is
so
constructed
that
it
would
make
it
virtually
impossible
for,
for
instance,
countywide
candidates
in
chittenden
county,
a
county
of
150,000,
the
largest
county
in
vermont...
they
would
be
limited
to
$4,000
for
the
primary
and
the
general
election.
that's
3
cents
for
each
person
in
chittenden
county.
and,
of
course,
this
is
an
important
county.
senator
leahy
came
from
that
county
as
state's
attorney
and
became
the
united
states
senator.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
the
rebuttable
presumption,
actually
the...
the
statute
answers
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
presumption
disappears.
if
you
look
at
2809,
subsection
(e),
the
last
sentence
says,
the
findings
and
determination
of
the
court...
and
this
is
in
this
court
proceeding
by
your
opponent
that
is
trying
to
claim
that
this
spending
over
here
is
actually
yours...
that
the
findings
and
the
determination
of
the
court
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
in
any
proceeding
brought
for
violation
of
the
chapter.
so
it
doesn't
go
away.
the
rebuttable
presumption
never
goes
away.
and,
in
fact,
each
person...
each
candidate
and
each
independent
spender
can
look
at
the
rebuttable
presumption
requirement
and
say,
i
have
to
file
a
report
and
that
governs
my
report.
thank
you.
