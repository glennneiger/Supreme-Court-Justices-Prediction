justice
john
paul
stevens
may
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
bopp?
this...
in...
following
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
inquiry,
is
it
your
view
that
there
is
no
set
of
facts,
no
matter
how
scandalous
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
watergate
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
could
ever
justify
an
expenditure
limit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
why...
why
would
it
be
inappropriate
to
have
further
hearings
in
this
case
to
see
whether
they're...
they
could
be
justified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand.
i'm
just
curious
to
know
what
sort
of...
what
sort
of
evidence
could
ever
support
an...
an
expenditure
limit
in
your
view,
if...
if
any.
