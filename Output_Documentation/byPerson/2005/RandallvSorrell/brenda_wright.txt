ms.
brenda
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
to
return
to
a
question
that
justice
kennedy
asked
earlier
about
why,
if
there
are
examples
of
corruption
that
the
public
becomes
aware
of,
why
the
public
doesn't
respond
simply
by
voting
the
individual
out
of
office.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
some
of
the
most
serious
examples
of
corruption
on
this
record
or
of
the
undue
influence
achieved
by
monetary
concerns
were
not
examples
that
ever
became
public
except
in
the
course
of
the
trial
of
this
case
when
we
had
witnesses
come
forward
to
testify
about
some
of
their
own
personal
experiences
in
the
legislature.
by
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
of
candidates
becoming
unduly
beholden
to
the
interests
that
can
provide
the
greatest
sums
for
their
campaigns,
those
kinds
of
incidents
are
not
going
to
typically
be
a
matter
of
discussion--
ms.
brenda
wright
--but
the--
ms.
brenda
wright
--two
points
on
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
problem
of
holding
candidates
accountable
in
that
manner
is
greatly
exacerbated
when
you
have
a
system
of
unlimited
spending
in
which
all
of
the
candidates
involved
feel
compelled
to
go
out
and
raise
as
much
as
they
can
in
order
to
forestall
the
possibility
of
being
outspent.
then
when
a
voter
says,
well,
why
are
you
doing
this,
the
candidate
has
a
ready
made
answer.
if
i
don't
do
this...
you
know,
maybe
i'd
rather
not,
but
if
i
don't,
i'm
going
to
be
bested
in
the
fund
raising
arms
race.
and
voters
reluctantly
have
come
to--
ms.
brenda
wright
--understand
that
that's--
ms.
brenda
wright
--well,
but--
ms.
brenda
wright
--what
we
do
have
is
candidates...
even
though
it
is
possible
to
run
effective
campaigns
in
vermont
for
lower
amounts,
candidates
nevertheless
go
out
and
raise
often
much
more
than
what
they
need.
here's
an
example
from
the
record.
we
had
senate
candidate
vincent
illuzzi.
in
1998,
he
raised
$39,000,
almost
$40,000,
for
his
senate
campaign.
his
challenger
was
able
to
raise
almost
nothing.
he
only
spent
$30,000
worth
of
that.
candidates
don't
need
$39,000
or
$30,000
to
run
an
effective
senate
campaign,
but
an
incumbent
that
builds
a
war
chest
has
the
ability
to
deter
serious
challenges.
ms.
brenda
wright
yes,
your
honor.
the...
we
believe
the
record
strongly
shows
that.
for
example,
there
was
a
mayoral
election
in
burlington
run
under
these
limits
during
the
time
that
the
case
was--
ms.
brenda
wright
--yes.
ms.
brenda
wright
yes,
your
honor,
because
this
burlington
mayor's
race,
as
an
example,
was
one
in
which
there
was
no
limit
on...
on
spending,
and
both
candidates
were
able
to
raise
amounts
either
similar
to
what
they
had
raised
in
the
past
or
at
least
amounts
that
met
the
campaign
budget
that
they
had
sought
to...
to
follow.
i
think
in
looking
at
the
level
of
the
contribution
limits,
it's
important
again
to
understand
the
scale
of
politics
in
vermont.
if
we
want
to
compare
them
to
missouri,
a
$2,000
limit
for
a
gubernatorial
race
in
missouri
was
approved
by
this
court,
and
in
missouri
you
had
an
election
in
2000
where
each
candidate
was
spending
$8
million
or
$9
million
in
a
gubernatorial
race.
i
mean,
that
compares
very
directly
if
you--
ms.
brenda
wright
--did
the
same
ratio
for
vermont.
pardon
me?
ms.
brenda
wright
not
the
$8
million
or
$9
million.
ms.
brenda
wright
in
missouri?
ms.
brenda
wright
it
may
have
been
the
state
auditor,
but
it
also
the--
ms.
brenda
wright
--no,
but
the--
ms.
brenda
wright
--yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
expenditure
limits
can
be
upheld
without
overruling
buckley
v.
valeo,
and
that's
for
several
reasons.
first,
buckley
created
a
rule
of
exacting
scrutiny
that
applies
to
expenditure
limits.
that
is
not
a
rule
of
automatic
invalidation.
and
very
importantly,
when
buckley
declared
that
the
interest
in
deterring
corruption
and
its
appearance
was
not
adequate
to
support
the
expenditure
limits,
that
was
on
a
record
in
which
neither
spending
nor
contributions
had
been
subject
to
meaningful
limits
prior
to
the
time
of
feca
and
the
amendments
that
the
court
was
considering.
there
simply
was
no
record
to
show
the
court
of
how
contribution
limits
alone
would
really
work
to
address
the
problem
of
corruption
and
the
appearance
of...
of
corruption
and
encouraging
public
confidence
in
government.
now--
ms.
brenda
wright
--your
honor,
i
think
that's
certainly
why
buckley
applied
exacting
scrutiny.
but
i
think
what
vermont
understood
is
that
political
spending
has
inescapably
a
dual
character.
yes,
campaign
spending
enables
many
forms
of
speech,
but
it
also
has
another
side
because
higher
and
higher
levels
of
campaign
spending
result
in
candidates
who
are
beholden
to
the
constituencies
that
can
provide
the
greatest
amounts
of
funds
for
their
campaigns.
and
what
you
end
up
with,
the
consequence,
is
legislators
who
say,
you
know,
i've
lost
the
drug
money
and
i
can't
afford
to
lose
the
food
manufacturer
money--
ms.
brenda
wright
--so
i'm
not
going
to--
ms.
brenda
wright
--well--
ms.
brenda
wright
--because
the...
the
interests
that
vermont
is
seeking
to
serve
are
fundamental
to
the
core
functions
of
government,
preserving
the
quality
of
representative
government,
preserving
the
integrity
of
government,
assuring
the
public
that
its
officeholders
can
act
in
the
best
interests
of
the
public
and
make
decisions
on
the
merits,
not
simply
based
on
their
need
for
campaign
cash.
and
this
question
of
accountability
that's
so
important
is
tied
to
the
ability
to
say,
i've...
i've
met
my
spending
limits,
i've
raised
all
that
i
need
to...
to
raise.
if
somebody
comes
to
me
with
contributions
from
a
source
that
i
don't
feel
comfortable
taking,
i
can
turn
that
down
without
suffering
a
tremendous
competitive
disadvantage.
i
think
one
of
the
other
key
features
of
the
expenditure
limits
that
vermont
seeks
to
impose
here
is
that
they
will
do
so
much
to
encourage
competitive
campaigns.
we
had
a
record
in
vermont
that
showed
that
for
the
previous
nine
election
cycles
before
the
act
was
enacted,
only
one
incumbent
had
been
defeated
for
a
statewide
office.
in
the
meantime,
in
the
city
of
albuquerque
where
they
had
spending
limits
for
25
years,
every
challenger
who
came
out
to
challenge
an
incumbent
mayor
was
successful.
no
one
can
say
on
that
record
that
spending
limits
would
do
anything
but
to
enhance
competition.
in
the...
one
of
the
other
interests
that
i
would
like
to
turn
to,
before
we
close,
is
vermont's
interest
in
protecting
the
time
of
officeholders
from
the
burdens
and
distractions
of
fund
raising.
we
had
a
record
in
which
seasoned
politicians
in
vermont
were
saying
that
candidates
for
office,
even
in
vermont,
were
spending
as
much
time
begging
for
funds
as
they
do
campaigning.
we
had
a
record
in
which
a
senator
reported
leaving
the
floor
of
the
senate
during
a
floor
debate
to
take
a
call
from
a
donor.
ms.
brenda
wright
well,
your--
ms.
brenda
wright
--yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
under
almost
any
system,
incumbents
are
going
to
still
have
advantages
and
no
campaign
finance
system
can
fully
address
that.
but
we
believe
that
if
the
challenger
now
has
the
ability
to
outspend
the
incumbent
and
the
incumbent
doesn't
have
that
additional
advantage
of
being
able
to
outspend
the
challenger,
as
is
most
often
the
case,
then
competition
can
only
be
enhanced.
