justice

or
at
least
where...
where
the
limitation...
you
make
a
big
point
of
this
in
your
brief
as...
as
i...
as
i
recall.
at
least
where
the
reason
the
candidate
would
have
to
spend
so
much
time
is
the
very
small
contribution
limit
established
by
the
same
statute.
it's...
it's
rather
like
the...
the
murderer
asking
for
mercy
because
he's
an
orphan,
having
killed
his
parents.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we...
we
didn't
send
it
back
so
that
more
of
a
record
could
be
made,
did
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you
know.
you
expect
them
to
name
names?
i
mean,
here--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
really,
that...
that's...
that's
a
lot
to
ask.
justice
antonin
scalia
only...
only
the
most
corruptible.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
would
also
prevent
the
candidate
himself
from
expending
his
entire
fortune,
if
he
wishes,
in
informing
people
of
why
he
should
be
elected--
justice
antonin
scalia
--think
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
raises
no
possibility
of
corruption.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
they
have
an
exception
for
the
wealthy
family.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what...
what
amounts
were
suspiciously
large?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
extent
that
vermont
legislators
can
be
bought
off
by
$51?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
sad.
[laughter]
but
that's
the
limit
you've
placed
on...
on
contributions.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the...
you
know,
if...
if
you
accept
more
than
$51,
you're...
you're
likely
to
have
your
vote
determined
by
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why...
why
the
$50
limit?
it
certainly
isn't
based
on
the
corruption--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
shows
that
on
average.
it
doesn't
show
that
in
the
competitive
races,
which
is
where
the...
where
the
shoe
pinches.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
what
i
said.
your
figures
show
that
the
average
spending
is
below,
but
that's
not
what's
significant.
what's
significant
is
what
justice
breyer
posed,
where...
where
there
is
a
contested
race
and...
and
some
new
candidate
wants
to
unseat
somebody
who's
been
in
there
for
years.
that's...
that's
where
the
shoe
pinches.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
have
a
primary?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
another
feature
of...
of
this
scheme
that
i
find
quite
puzzling.
you
get
the
same
expenditure
limit
for
the
election
cycle
whether
you
go
through
a
primary
or
not.
what
an
advantage
that
is
for
the
incumbent.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
burden
is
on
the
candidate
to
establish
that...
that
somebody's
expenditure
is
independent
and
shouldn't
be
counted
against
his
expenditure
limit.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
presumption,
which
means
the
burden,
to
go
forward
and
show
the
opposite,
is
on
him.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
money
that
he
spends
in
overcoming
that
presumption
is
charged
against
his
expenditure.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
side
says
the
opposite.
i'll
ask
them
whether
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
thereafter,
all
the...
all
the
candidate
has
to
say
is
in
an
affidavit,
no,
it
wasn't
coordinated,
and
then
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
show
that
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
the
opposing
candidate
or
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i...
i
thought
that
the
point
was
that
the
public
mistrusts
their
representatives
because
of
large
donations,
and
i
thought
the
point
being
made
was,
well,
if
that's
the
case
and
the
public
sees
that
this
fellow
has
gotten
a
$10,000
donation,
the
public
will
say
this...
this
fellow
is
in
that...
is
in
that
corporation's
or
that
person's
pocket.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
won't
vote
for
that
person.
you...
you
don't
have
to
show
that...
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
candidate,
that...
that
he
voted
for
the
bill
because
he
got
$10,000.
the
mere
fact
that
it's
on
the
public
record
that
he
got
$10,000,
if...
if
what
you
say
is
correct,
that...
that
people
are
worried
about,
the...
the
corruptive
effect
of
such
donations,
people
should
logically
vote
against
that
candidate
who
accepts
so
much
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought...
i
thought
what
that
case
said
and
what
many
of
our
other
cases
say,
with
regard
to
expenditures
in
particular,
is
that
you're
not
talking
about
money
here.
you're
talking
about
speech.
so
long
as
all
that
money
is
going
to
campaigning,
you're
talking
about
speech.
and
when
you
say
you
don't
need
any
more
speech
than
this,
that's
a
very
odd
thing
for...
for
a...
a
united
states
government
to
say.
enough
speech.
you
don't
need
any
more
than
this.
and
that's
the
reason
the
expenditure
limits,
as
opposed
to
contribution
limits,
were
regarded
quite
differently
in
buckley
and
i
think
should
still
be
regarded
differently
today.
you're
constraining
speech.
it's
not
money
you're
constraining.
contribution
limits,
you're
constraining
money,
but
when
you
say
you
can't
expend
more
than
this
on
your
campaign,
you're
saying,
no,
no,
no,
this
is
enough
speech.
we're
going
to...
we,
the
state,
are
going
to
tell
you
how
much
you
should
campaign.
that's
very
unusual
in...
in
american
democracy.
justice
antonin
scalia
limit
the
contributions.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
solves
that
problem.
limit
the
contributions.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
want
to
limit
expenditures,
even
if
it's
the
person's
own
money.
no
possibility
of
corruption.
you're
saying,
no,
this
is
enough
speech.
we
don't
want
to
hear
any
more
from
you.
we,
the
state,
will
tell
you
how
much
campaigning
is
enough.
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
how
that
comes.
how
does
that
come
about?
