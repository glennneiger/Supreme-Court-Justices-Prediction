mr.
william
h.
sorrell
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
justice
kennedy,
you
raised
the
issue
of
whether
money
buys
access.
it
clearly
does.
our
governor
admitted
that
in
a
state
of
the
state
address.
but
we
also
had
testimony
at
trial
from
a
former
statewide
officeholder
that
money,
of
course,
buys
access,
but
on
the
bad
days,
it
buys
influence.
and
we
had
the
president--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--of
the
senate--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--the...
there
was
testimony
that
the
president
of
the
senate
said
to
another
senator
who
was
testifying
at
trial,
we've
lost
the
drug
money.
i'm
not
willing
to
lose
the
food
manufacturer
money,
so
i'm
not
going
to
sign
this
bill.
that
same
president
of
the
senate
testified
in
a
legislative
hearing...
i...
he
admitted
that
he
makes
decisions
in
performing
his
legislative
duties
because
of
that
whole
lot
of
money
that
he
had
collected
in
the
year
before.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
influenced
and--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--have
an
influence
and
we
would
suggest
an
undue
influence
in
some
cases.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
we
didn't
have
anyone,
as
justice
scalia
asked,
who
stood
up
and
admitted
to
having
taken
bribes.
we
did
have
the
senator,
who
was
the
chair
of
the
senate
finance
committee,
who
said
that
she's
not
in
favor
of
tax
credits,
but
she
had
a
donor
to
her
campaign
who
had
given
$500
in
one
campaign
cycle
and
$1,000
in
another
cycle,
and
she
allowed
a
tax
credit
to
go
through
her
taxing
committee,
even
though
substantively
she
didn't
like
tax
credits.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
we
have
not
had
any
of
legislators
or
statewide
officers
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
it
is
a
serious
problem.
over
70
percent
of
vermonters
at...
there
was
testimony
at
trial
from
an
expert
that
over
70
percent
of
vermonters
believed
that
corporate
interests
and
wealthy
individuals
have
an
undue
influence
on
politics
in
the
state,
and
i
think
73
percent
believe
that
the
average
citizen--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--we
have
a
real
problem
in
vermont.
we
haven't
had
a
governor
go
to
prison.
we
haven't
had
legislators
tearfully
apologizing
for
having
taken
bribes,
facing
an
indictment
the
next
day.
but
we
have
got
a
problem
in
vermont.
in
over
65
hearings
before
our
legislature
and
then
through
a
10-day
trial,
we
established
that
as
the
trial
court
said,
the
threat
of
corruption
in
vermont
is
far
from
illusory.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
there's
nothing
in
the
record--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--i...
no.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
no,
i...
we
don't
suggest...
we
don't
suggest
that.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
i
don't
know
what
$50
limit
you
are
talking--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--oh,
it's--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--it's
the
math.
the
reality
is
that
these
contribution
limits
that
we
had...
we
had
examples
under
the
old
contribution
limits.
even
petitioner
randall
admitted
that
in
vermont,
a
$1,000
contribution...
if
you
receive
a
$1,000
contribution
in
vermont...
this
is
one
of
the
petitioners...
then
vermonters
think
that
you've
been
bought.
and
that's
the
reality--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--the
buckley
court
thought
that
disclosure
obligations
and
contribution
limits
alone
would
be...
would
suffice
to
address
corruption
and--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--for
a
house
race,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
incumbents
had
a
much
more
of
an
advantage
in
the
pre
act
64
world.
they
could
raise
more
money
and
spend
more
money
than--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--vermont
has
the--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--vermont
has
the
second
lowest
gubernatorial
spending
in
the
country.
in
the
record
it
shows
that
in
the
largest
urban
area
in
the
state,
in
the
burlington
area,
you
can
buy
three
30-second
tv
ads
in
prime
time
on
tier
one
cable
for
$45.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
the
extensive
record
below
shows
that
with
these
contribution
limits,
attacking
the
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
corruption
issue,
the
candidates
can
amass
the
resources
necessary
to
run
effective
campaigns
at
all
levels.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
the...
the
reality
is
that...
that
in
virtually
all
classes
of
races,
other
than
the
single
member
senate
races,
that
average
spending
was
below
these
expenditure
limits,
and
these
include
contested
cases
with
primaries,
without.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
and,
justice
scalia,
under
our
law,
the
challenger
can
spend
more
than
the
incumbent
because
the
incumbent
has
a
lid
not...
of
85
percent
or
90
percent
of
the
expenditure
limit,
depending
on
whether
it's
a
legislative
race
or
a...
or
a
statewide
race.
but
the...
the
issue
here
is
you're
going
to
have
some...
some
outliers.
but
we
have
core
constitutional
interests
in
trying
to
enhance
the
integrity
of
our
campaigns.
we
have
this
problem.
the
legislature
reached
a
balance
here.
it
looked
at
what...
how
much
you
would
need
to
run
effective
campaigns.
it
set--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--we
have
the
second
lowest...
smallest
legislative
districts
in
the
country,
4,000
citizens
per
single
member
legislative
district.
sure,
that's
what
it
costs
to
take
out
an
ad
in
the
free
press,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
house
candidates,
legislative
candidates,
take
out
those
size
ads
in...
in
the
burlington
free
press.
the
record
is
otherwise.
the
record
reflects
that
it's
primarily
door
to
door
campaigning
for
legislative
races.
if
you're
taking
out
an
ad,
it's
in...
it's
a
flyer
in
one
of
the...
the
weekly
papers.
petitioner
donald
brunelle
admitted
that
he
ran
a
competitive
race
for
the
house,
spending
$1,000,
that
included
yard
signs,
a
mailing
to
his
constituents,
and
flyer
advertisements
in...
in
the
newspaper.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
i
don't
know
whether
he
had
a
primary
or
not.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
the...
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that
those
who
have
a
primary
might
actually
get
a
bump
over
others
who
are
not
challenged.
but
as
the
district
court
pointed
out,
in
vermont
what
makes
vermont
different
is
that
our
primary
is
late.
it's
the
second
tuesday
in
september,
and
so
it's
less
than
8
weeks
from
the
general
election.
it's
not
like
having
a
primary
in
the
spring.
and
as
the
legislature
during
those
65
hearings
considered
the
campaigning,
they
considered
all
kinds
of
campaigns,
including
contested
primaries
and
not,
and
again,
average
spending
in
these
campaigns
was,
with
minor
exception
of
the
single
member
senate
districts,
of
which
there
are
three...
that
average
spending
was
below
these
expenditure
limits.
so
in
the
average
campaign,
you
could
actually
spend
more
than...
than
on
average
is
being
spent.
and
the
issue,
when
you've
got
competing
constitutional
interests,
is
whether
we
address
our
problems
of
corruption,
appearance
of
corruption.
we
try
to
free
up
candidates'
and
public
officials'
time
from
fund
raising.
we
try
to
create
competitive
elections
and
bring
more
citizens
into
the
process
voting,
grassroots
campaigning,
and
standing
for
election.
we
want
more
people
to
run.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
we
don't
have
that
evidence
in
the
record.
what
we
have
is
that
we...
the
experts
looked
at
total
spending,
which
would
include
primary
spending
and
general
election
spending,
and
our
figures
went
from
that.
and
our
expert,
by
the
way,
considered
all
races,
even
those
for
which
campaign
finance
reports
were
not
filed,
meaning
that
the
candidate
hadn't
raised
or
expended
more
than
$500,
and
assumed
$500
in
spending
in
each
one
of
those...
each
one
of
those
races.
so
our
average
spending
figures
actually
might
be
a
little
higher
than...
than
reality.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
and
that
might
be
an
issue
that
on
remand...
and
this
case
is
being
remanded
on
a
couple
of
issues
that
aren't
even
before
this
court.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
no,
it's
not
on
the
contributions,
but
it
is
going
back
to
the
court
on
issues
of
transfers
of
money
from
national
parties
to
state
parties
and
on
whether
related
or
coordinated
expenditures
are,
indeed,
allowed
to
be
an
expenditure.
so
the
case
is
going
back
to
the
trial
court
on
those
bases
anyway.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
i--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--that
has
not
been
a
problem
that
was
reflected
in
the
record
either
before
the
legislature
or
at
trial.
this
is
a
facial
challenge
for
the
law,
and
you
know,
that
situation
of
a
primary
candidate
who,
for
whatever
reason,
felt
that
he
or
she
needed
to
expend
up
to
close
to
the
expenditure
limit...
it
wouldn't
be
very
prudent,
but
that
could
be
an
issue.
but,
you
know,
we
do
not
control
independent
expenditures
under
our
law,
and
we
certainly
don't
limit
volunteer
services.
there's
a
tremendous
amount
of
campaigning
that
can
go
on
between
a
primary
and
a
general
election
even
with
a
limited
amount
of
funds
available.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
no.
there
is
a
presumption
under
our
law--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--well,
but
it
could
be
on
the...
on
the
party
because--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--no,
justice
scalia.
the
secretary
of
state
reached
a...
issued
an
opinion
that
we...
our
office
agrees
with,
that
expenditures
on
attorneys
for,
you
know,
ballot
access
questions
and
the
like
are
not
in
furtherance
of
the
candidacy
and
would
not
apply
against
the
expenditure--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--but
the...
the
secretary
of
state's
public
opinion
that
we,
the
enforcement
authority,
agree
with
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
the...
the...
under
vermont
law,
a
presumption
such...
such
as
this
is
not
a
burden...
creates
no
burden
of
persuasion,
nor
does
it
change
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
well,
if
you...
if
some
entity
that
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
show,
in
fact,
that
it
was
a
related
or
coordinated
expenditure
has
the
party
on
the
one
hand
and
the
candidate
on
the
other
saying,
we
did
not
coordinate
here,
i
didn't
ask
for
it,
i
didn't
approve
it,
and
then
where
is
the
evidence?
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
yes.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
well,
credible
evidence,
yes.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
yes.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
if
the
state
is
the
party
that's
trying
to
prove
that
it
was,
in
fact,
a
coordinated
expenditure,
under
the
law...
it
would
typically
be
a
opposing
candidate
who
tries
to--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--so
justice
brandeis
said
that
there's
room
under
our
system
for
a
courageous
state
to
experiment.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
yes.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
yes,
you
drive.
then
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
well,
but
it's
your
car,
you're
there.
no.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
as
long
as
it's
under
$100.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
we
don't...
our
coffee
is
not
that
expensive,
but--
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
--yes.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
no.
over
$100
counts.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
under
$100,
it
does
not.
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
william
h.
sorrell
thank
you.
