justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
to
get
back
to
justice
souter's
questions,
could
you
answer
it
this
way?
let's
assume
that
some
members
of
the
court
simply
accepted
the
proposition
that
money
buys
access.
and...
and
i
don't
think
maybe
we
can
take
judicial
of
that,
but
i...
i
think
that's
a
common
sense
conclusion
that
we
can
reach.
and
you
tend
to
fight
this
in
your
brief
to
say
that
this
doesn't
happen.
i
tend
to
doubt
that.
i
tend
to
think
money
does
buy
access.
what...
if...
if
we
or
i
were
to
conclude
that,
what
would
follow?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
let's
say
it's
privileged
access.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
isn't
the
answer
that
the...
that
this
is
up
to
the
voters.
the
voters
can
see
what's
going
on
and
throw
the
legislator
out
if
they
choose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it...
it
is
true
that
all
the
polls
say
that
there's
public
disaffection
and
cynicism.
does
that
translate
into
action
to
defeat
incumbents
who
take
particularly
large
sums
of
money?
is
there...
is
there
statistical
evidence
to
show
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
three
legislators
had
been
corrupted,
venal,
criminal
corruption,
actually
taking
no
wink
wink,
nod
nod,
a
specific
agreement
to
vote
for
money.
so
what?
does
that
change
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
that
had
been
demonstrated
in...
in
a
particular
state.
does
that
mean,
in
your
view,
that
a
state
can
have
strict
contribution
limits
and
support?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
it's
true.
it's...
it's
done.
there
have
been
criminal
convictions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
if...
if
you...
if
you
concede
and...
and
you
tend,
at
least,
to
back
away
from
the
proposition
that
the
case
i
put
would
be
an
inadequate
ground
or
an
adequate
ground
for
legislative
limits,
then
i
suppose
you
can
say
the
state
has
the
power
to
prevent
this
from
happening
to
begin
with.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in...
in
any...
or
in
many
campaigns,
the...
the
issues
take
shape
during
the
process
of
the
campaign,
and
there
are
historical
events,
national
events
that
suddenly
occur
that
people
want
to
comment
on.
and
i...
i
just
don't
see
that
there's
any
capacity
for
adjusting
so
that
the
public
can
know
how
candidates
are
facing
issues
that
are
beginning
to
emerge
that
the
public
has
a
vital
interest
in.
my
understanding
was
that
a
quarter
page
ad
in
the
burlington
newspaper
was,
i
think,
$1,400.
now,
it's...
it's
gratifying
to
know
that
vermonters
are
splurging
on
cable
television,
but
it...
it--
[laughter]
--it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
highly
restrictive
rule
insofar
as
having
the
campaign
be
able
to
address
the
issues
that
the
voters
say
that
they've
become
interested
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
the
vermont
courts
could
construe
it
more
narrowly
at
some
later
point.
i
would
hate
to
rest
the
opinion
on
that.
