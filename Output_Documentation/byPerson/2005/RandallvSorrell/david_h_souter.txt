justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
when...
when
you
make
that
point,
that
on
this
record
the...
the
claimed
interests
are
not
compelling
or
not
proven,
would
you
have
us
leave
the
door
open
for
a
greater
degree
of
proof?
for
example,
take
the...
the
problem
of
candidate
time.
the
lower
the
donation
limits
are,
the...
the
more
donations
there
have
got
to
be,
and...
and
there's...
there's
plenty
of
comment,
particularly
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs,
on
the
amount
of
time
that
political
candidates
generally
spend
scrounging
around
for
money.
if
we
decided
the
case
your
way,
would
the
door
be
left
open
for
a
more
impressive
and
compelling
record
on
this
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
also
say,
on
this
record.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i...
i
take
it
your
point
then
on
the
combined
corruption/competition
for
money
problem
is
that
there
isn't
any
record
that
would
support
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
you're
saying
this
combination
cannot
be
a
compelling
interest
as
a
matter
of
law,
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
it...
it
was
pointed
out
in...
in
one
of
the
briefs...
and
i...
i
didn't
go
back
and
check
it
myself,
but
i'd
like
your
comment.
it
was
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
the
limits
in
vermont
were
substantially
close
to
or
even...
even
higher
than
the...
than
the
limits
in
the
missouri
scheme,
out
of
which
the
shrink
litigation
grew.
do
you
know
whether
that
is
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
always...
it
always
does,
yes.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
take
the
whole
schedule
in
missouri.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bopp,
toward
the
end
of
your
brief,
you...
you
make
the
argument
that
if
we
accepted
the
state's
position
in
this
case,
we
implicitly
would
have
accepted
the
position
that
totally...
totally
publicly
funded
elections
would
be
constitutional.
and...
and
i...
i
realize
your...
your
concern
there
was
with
expenditure
limits,
obviously,
not
contribution
limits.
you
didn't
come
out
and
say
it,
but
i...
i
assume
your
position
is
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional
per
se.
a
totally
publicly
funded
scheme
would
be
unconstitutional
per
se.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
its
unconstitutionality
would
rest
on
the
limitation
on
expenditure,
in
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
yes,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on...
on
your
view,
if...
if
there
were
a...
a
mandatory
publicly
funded
scheme
and
the...
the
limits
on
expenditure
were
very
high...
it
was
a
very
generous
scheme.
they
gave
them
lots
of
money...
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
because
there
would
be...
i...
i
take
it
on
your
view,
because
there
would
be
an
elimination
of
any
way
to
participate
by
contributing.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
sorrell,
would
you
go
back
to
the...
your
comment
on...
on
average
expenditures?
do
we
know
from
the
record
how
many
of
the...
how
many
of
the
contests,
on
the
basis
of
which
the
average
was
calculated,
were
contests
in
which
there
was
a...
a
contested
primary?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
going
back
on
the
expenditure
limit.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
the
problem,
i
mean,
i
was
getting
at
and
justice
ginsburg
is
getting
at,
judge
winter
got
at
it.
the...
the
problem
is...
is
the...
the
total
limitation
on
an
election
cycle,
including
the
primary,
when
the
primary
involves
a
challenge
so
that
the
challenger
has
an
uphill
fight
presumably
to
start
with
in
the
primary.
and
if
he's
going
to
maintain
an
effective
uphill
fight
in
the
primary
and
he's
lucky
enough
to
win,
he's
going
to
get
to
the
general
election
and
he's
going
to
be
broke.
that's...
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
problem
that
we're
concerned
with.
justice
david
h.
souter
may...
may
i
ask--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
you
know,
i
looked
at
your...
the...
the
references
in
your
brief
for
that
proposition,
and
i
did
not
see
them
borne
out.
you
referred
to
a...
a
footnote
in
the
district
court
opinion
which,
in
turn,
refers
to
the
remark
of
a
sponsor
of
the
amendment
that...
that
resulted
in
the
presumption
being
in
the
law.
and
the
only
thing
that
was
attributed
to
the
sponsor
was
that
the
presumption
should
be
regarded
as
rebuttable.
the...
the
footnote
in
the
statement
did
not
indicate
that
the
presumption
was
a
disappearing
presumption,
once
the
other
side
went
forward
with
any
evidence.
so
i
don't
see,
based
on
your...
your
citations,
that
the
presumption
goes
away
simply
by...
by
one
party
going
forward
with
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
point
is
what
if
we
don't
have
that
simple
of
a
situation.
let...
let
me
ask
you
this.
maybe
we
can
short
circuit
this.
i
mean,
do
you
represent
as
an...
as
a
statement
of
vermont
law
that
this
court
should
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
presumption
is
a
disappearing
presumption,
once
evidence
is
offered
against
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
