justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
you...
do
you
contend
it's
always
applied
first
to
the
medical
damages?
in
other
words,
supposing
there
was...
instead
of
the
$750,000
settlement,
it
had
been
$100,000
here.
$75,000
was
medical,
and
they
had
a
lot
of
substantial
other
claims,
pain,
suffering,
loss
of
earnings,
and
so
forth.
would
you
always
get
your
full
amount
if...
if
the
amount
of
the
settlement
is
over
the
amount
of
the
medical
expense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that's
the
equitable
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
might
be
because...
it
might
be
because
there's
contributory
negligence,
all
sorts
of
things.
they
might
have
compromised
at
20
cents
on
the
dollar
across
the
board.
why
should
you
get
100
cents
when
the...
when
the
rest
of
the
recovery
only
gets
20...
20
cents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
equitable
in
your
view?
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that's
the
equitable
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
some
do,
but
some
do
not
i
think.
