justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
this?
if
the...
if
the
day
before
the
settlement
was
consummated,
the
plan
had
gone
into
court
and
had
said
the...
the
beneficiaries
plan
to
settle
the
case
and
they've
indicated
that
they're
not
going
to
give
us
any
of
the
settlement
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
we
want
an
injunction
preventing
their
distribution
to
anyone
but...
but
us,
if
the...
if
the
judge
believed
that
and
believed
that
under
the
contract,
the
plan
was
entitled
to
reimbursement,
could
the
judge
have
enjoined
the...
the
distribution
of
the
funds
to
the...
you
know,
to
the
extent
of
the
plan's
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
could
enforce
the
injunction.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that...
that
was...
that
was
an
ex
post
remedy
and
there
were
no
identifiable
funds.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
an
ex
ante
injunction
and
the
funds
are
identifiable.
and
you
are
telling
me
that,
in
fact,
all
the...
all
the
equity
court
could
have
said
was,
don't
pay
yourself?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
could
not
have
said,
give
the
$75,000,
or
whatever
it
is,
to
the
plan?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
we
get
down
to
clever
attempts,
aren't
we
at
the
clever
attempt
point
when...
when
you
say
that
they
can
enjoin
the
distribution
to
anybody
else,
including
themselves,
but
they
can't
tell
them
to
pay
the
money
to...
to
greatwest?
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
point
at
which
we
get
to
silliness?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you...
in
any
case,
i
don't
want
to
prolong
this
unduly.
you're
saying
that
there
would
have
been
some
equitable
claim
and
some
equitable
remedy
with
respect
to
the
$75,000
that...
that
a...
a
court
could
have
taken
cognizance
of
the
day
before
the
settlement.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i'm...
i'm
just
trying
to
characterize
your
answer
to
me.
you
said,
yes,
that
would
be
an
injunction
and
it
would
be
an
injunction
typical
of
what
courts
of
equity
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't...
isn't
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
the
equity
court
would
not
enforce
any
injunction
or
any
mandatory
order,
or
whatever
the
relief
was,
if
it
involved
double
recovery?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
did
you
attempt
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
did...
did
you
respond
to
the
summary
judgment
by
saying,
you
know,
there
are
reasons
why
they
should...
specific
reasons
why
they
shouldn't
get
the
full
75?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
were
denied
a
hearing
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
that
may
be
a...
a
reason
for
you
to
appeal
on
the
merits,
but
i
don't
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
the...
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
as...
as
awarding
equitable
relief.
maybe
it
did
a
poor
job
in
deciding
what
was
equitable.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it...
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
power
to
award
an
equitable
remedy.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
would
have
nothing
to
say
if
they
hadn't
invoked
the
contract.
they've
got
to
invoke
the
contract.
the
question
is,
are
they
asking
for
equitable
relief?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
without
a
contract,
they
could
have
gone
in
and
said,
we'd
like
$75,000?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
are
you
suggesting
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
would
have
been
different
if
they
had
gone...
if
the...
if
the
plan
had
gone
in
and
said,
we
don't
care
anything
about
our
contract,
we're
just
relying
on
equitable
principles
of
subrogation?
in
that
case,
are
you
suggesting
the
court
would
have
had
equitable
jurisdiction,
whereas
when
they
went
in
and
said,
we
happen
to
have
a
contractual
right
to
this,
the
court
doesn't
have
equitable
jurisdiction?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
that's
implicit
in
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
why...
why
isn't
the
answer
to
your
argument
the...
the
historical
answer
that
courts
of
equity
frequently
provided
remedies
and
supplementary
remedies
when
remedies
at
law
were
not
fully
adequate?
and
they
were
still
equitable
remedies.
they
were
still
typically
equitable,
and
that's
what
is
being
requested
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
that
the
answer
to
your...
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
justice
breyer's
question
is
the
eggs
have
gotten
scrambled.
that's
the...
that's
the
hypothesis.
are
you
saying
or
are
you
going
to
say
you
can't
unscramble
the
eggs
consistently
with...
with
the
limitation
to
equitable
remedies,
or
are
you
going
to
say
you
can
unscramble
the
eggs?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
what
i
meant
by
scrambled
eggs.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
justice
breyer's
hypothetical?
is
the...
is
the
court
under
erisa
incapable
of
dealing
with
that
situation,
or
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
under
that...
under
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
a
court,
consistently
with
erisa,
could
give
an
equitable
remedy?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
apply
simply
as
a
matter
of...
of
contract
construction
in
determining
what
the
contract
was
that...
that
would
be
looked
to
for
determining
what
equitable
remedy
would
be
available.
