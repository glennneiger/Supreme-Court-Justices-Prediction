mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this...
this
case
is
an
action
for
appropriate
equitable
relief
under
this
court's
decision
in
greatwest.
first,
it
seeks
a
specifically
identifiable
fund,
which
is
the
money
that
petitioners
got
from
their
tort
settlement.
second,
that
fund
can
be
traced
to
petitioners.
it's
sitting
now
in
an
investment
account,
and
they've
committed
to
holding
it
there.
third,
the
fund
belongs
in
good
conscience
to
the
plan
because
the
plan
provided
that
the
fund...
that
that
fund,
quote,
must
be
used
to
reimburse
the
plan,
quote,
for
benefits
paid.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
with
respect.
in
barnes
against
alexander
and
in
the
whole
line
of
cases
that
we
cite,
the
court
has
made
quite
clear
that
parties
can
commit
contractually
that
a
particular
fund
that
will
come
into
existence
in
the
future
should
be
used
for
a
certain
purpose,
and
that
will
be
equitably
enforced.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
that's
right.
and
if
you're
enforcing
a
contract
and
you're
seeking
normal
contractual
damages
of
various
sorts,
you
definitely
do
that
legally
and
not
equitably.
but
equity
always
enforced
contracts.
they
would
enforce
its
equitable
liens
that
were
created
by
contract.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
walker
against
brown,
which
was
not
an
attorney's
fees
case...
by
the
way,
on...
in
barnes
against
alexander,
which
was
an
attorney's
fees
case,
nowhere
in
the
decision
does
the
court
rely
at
all
on
the
fact
that
this
had
anything
to
do
with
any
special
rule
that
applies
to
attorney's
fees.
but
that,
in
turn,
relied
on
the
prior
case
of
walker
against
brown
in
which...
just
involved
an
equitable
lien
that
was
created
by
contract
and
that
a
party
was
trying
to
enforce.
and
the
court
quoted
pomeroy's
treatise.
now,
walker
was
decided
in
1897.
pomeroy's
treatise
on
equity,
quote,
every
express
executory
agreement
in
writing,
whereby
the
contracting
party
sufficiently
indicates
an
intention
to
make
some
particular
property,
real
or
personal,
or
fund
therein
described
or
identified
as
a
security
or
a
debt,
creates
an
equitable
lien
upon
the
property
so
described.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
in
general,
i
think
that
the
terms
of
the
plan,
both
under
erisa
law
and
under
these
traditional
equitable
principles
that
we've
talked
about
or
i
mentioned
just
now,
that
the
plan
would
likely
be
entitled
to
get...
get
up
to
the
amount
of
the
medical
expenses--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
it
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
is
the
case
that
in
extreme
cases,
for
example,
the
beneficiary
has
collected
the
medical
benefits,
does
have
some
leverage
over
the
plan,
and
in
fact,
the
plan...
and...
and
can
say,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
bring
the
claim,
i'm
not
going
to,
you
know,
do
what
i
can
to
collect
the
money
unless
we
come
to
some
kind
of
agreement.
and
in
fact,
the
plan
in
this
case
provides...
that
says,
the
company's
share
of
recovery
will
not
be
reduced
because
your...
you
have
not
received
the
full
damages
claimed,
unless
the
company
agrees
in
writing
to
a
reduction.
and
they
leave
it
open
there...
the
inappropriate
cases...
for
the
cases
to
negotiate
that.
but
there
was
no
bar
in
equity
for
an
equitable
court
to
enforce
an
equitable
lien
that
arose
out
of
a
contract
where
it
satisfied
the...
the
standards
for
an
equitable
lien.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
first
of
all,
make
whole
i
think
is
best...
there
are
a
variety
of
make
whole
rules.
in
addition
to
those
that
mr.
coleman
mentioned,
there's
a
rule
where
you
prorate
the
settlement
in
certain
ways
so
that
you
get
some
proportion.
but
the
basic
make
whole
rule,
as
has
been
described
by
the
courts
of
appeals,
is
a
default
rule
and
that
is
where
you're
just
relying
on
a
pure
subrogation
clause
or
you
don't
mention
it
at
all
in
a
particular
insurance
document,
then
some
courts
have
said
you
apply
some
kind
of
make
whole
rule
or
some
other
allocation
rule
to
figure
out
how
much
of
the
tort
recovery
goes
to
the
insurer.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
where
you...
where
the
parties
have
specified.
even
in
other...
in
insurance
law
generally,
where
the
parties
have
specified
in
the
insurance
contract
how
that's
supposed
to
work,
then
the
courts
will
enforce
that.
and
there's
nothing
unusual
in
courts
of
equity
taking
a
look
at
the
agreement
that
was
reached
between
a...
the
parties,
presumably
supported
by
consideration,
in
deciding
what
kind
of
relief
to
grant.
that
was
a
traditional
function
that
equity
served.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think,
first
of
all,
the...
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
there's
a
cause
of
action.
those...
that
question
really
goes
to
the
amount
of
money
that
gets
recovered
in
the
cause
of
action,
and
actually
the...
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
doesn't
squarely
present
that.
but
insofar
as
where
you're
going
on
to
that
further...
because
this
case
can
be
just
answered
by
saying,
yes,
there's
a
cause
of
action
under
502(a)(3).
now,
insofar
as
the
court
goes
further
into
the
make
whole
doctrine,
i
think
generally
courts
should...
courts
have
recognized
that
under
erisa
what
they're
supposed
to
do
is
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
court
has
recognized
that...
that
federal
courts,
especially
in
an
unusual
circumstance
like
that...
but
federal
courts
do
have
the
obligation
under
erisa
to
determine
a
common
law
of
rights
and
obligations
under
erisa
plans.
and
there
are
doctrines
like
unconscionability
and
other
doctrines
that
may
be
applied
in
particular
cases
where
some
plan
is
just
taking
advantage
of
another
party,
where--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
it
would
still
be
an
equitable
claim
because
the
question
still
is
are
you
enforcing
the
terms
of
the
plan,
and...
and
the
equitable
lien
cases
make
quite
clear
that
that
court
in
equity
will
enforce
that
so
long
as
a
particular...
so
long
as
a
particular
fund,
even
if
it
has
not
yet
come
into
existence,
is
what's
been
specified.
in
fact,
the
cases
that
are
cited
by
petitioners'
counsel
to
the
contrary,
starting
with
the
trist
case,
was
a
case
that
was
specifically
disapproved
in
barnes
against
alexander
as
resting
on
other
grounds.
that
was
a
case
where
the...
there
was
a
contingent
fee
for
lobbying
congress
and
there
was
a
statute
that
forbade
it.
there
were
two
other
grounds
that
the
court
decided
the
case,
and
then
justice
holmes
in
the
barnes
case
went
on
to
say...
well,
insofar
as
the
question
is
open,
he
gave
the
answer,
which
is
the
question
as
to
whether
there's
an
equitable
lien
is
determined
by
what
the
contract
says.
as
far
as
the
make
whole
doctrine,
another
point
about
the
make
whole
doctrine
that's
worth
keeping
in
mind
is
that
insofar
as
some
states
have
applied
it,
as
a
matter
of
their
insurance
law
and
have
said,
well,
an
insurance
company
is
not
allowed
under
our
state's
law
to
contract
out
of
the
make
whole
doctrine
which
we...
under
our
state's
law
is
the
default
rule.
insofar
as
a
state
has
said
that,
that
would
apply
equally
to
erisa
plans
under
the
insurance
savings
clause
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
i
think
that
it
would.
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
and
if
the
insurance
contract
departed
from
what
the
state's
law
was,
the
state's
law
would
govern
it
under
erisa's
insurance
savings
clause.
but
where
you
have
an...
and
so
the...
the
case
with
erisa
plans
is
not
really
any
different
than
it
is
outside
erisa.
insofar
as
a
state
under
its
insurance
law
decides
to
establish
a
make
whole
doctrine
or
an
allocation
rule
of
some
sort
or
a
default
rule,
it
can
do
that,
and
that
can
be
applied
to
insured
erisa
plans.
but
as
to
uninsured
erisa
plans,
it
wouldn't
be
applied.
and
that...
this
court
established
that
in
its
decision
in
fmc
against
holliday.
this
case
really
actually
arises...
it
was
really...
it
was
at
the
intersection
of
two
distinct
doctrines
that...
two
distinct
lines
of
cases
that
both
support
equitable
relief
in
a
case
like
that.
one
is
the...
those
that
i've
spoken
about
already,
which
is
the
equitable
lien
cases.
the
other
is
the
line
of
subrogation
cases
that
mr.
coleman
spoke
about.
and
from
the
very
earliest
times,
it
was
recognized
in
subrogation
cases
that
that
gave
the
insurer
not
only
a
right
to
advance
the
insured's
claim,
but
where
the
insured
advanced
the
claim
and
got
a
recovery,
he
holds
it
as
a
trustee
for
the
insurer.
and
that
was
recognized
from
the
early...
from
the
mid-18th
century
cases
that
mr.
coleman
cited
in
his
brief.
it
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
comegys...
the
comegys
case,
written
by
justice
story
in
the
1820's,
and
it's
been
a
consistent
rule.
and
this
is
an
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan
because
it
arises
directly
at
the
confluence
of
those
two
lines
of
equitable
cases.
thank
you.
