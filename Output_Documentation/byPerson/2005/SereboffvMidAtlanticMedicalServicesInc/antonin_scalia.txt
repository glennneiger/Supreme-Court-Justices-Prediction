justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stris,
i'd...
i'd
like
to
know
what...
what
you
make
of
our
opinion
in
barnes
v.
alexander.
it's
an
old
case
but
it
involved
a
situation
similar
to
this,
namely,
a
contingent
fee
arrangement
with
a
lawyer,
and
the
client
received
all
the
money,
without
giving
the
lawyer
his
contingent
fee.
we
reasoned
in
our
opinion
that,
quote,
the
contract
for
a
contingent
fee
out
of
a
fund
awarded
constituted
a
lien
upon
the
fund
and
that,
quote,
it
is
one
of
the
familiar
rules
in
equity
that
a
contract
to
convey
a
specific
object,
even
before
it
is
acquired,
will
make
the
contractor
a
trustee
as
soon
as
he
gets
title
to
the
thing.
why
doesn't
that
absolutely
resolve
the
present
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we...
but,
you
know,
our
opinions
haven't
said
only
certain
kinds
of
equitable
relief,
only
restitutionary
equitable
relief.
we've
simply
said
whether
equitable
relief
would
normally
be
available.
and
now
you're...
you're
trying
to
rewrite
our
cases
to
say
that
only
certain
types
of
equitable
relief
are...
are
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
if,
indeed,
it
does...
it
does
occupy
a
lot
of
the
field,
so
be
it.
that's
the
way
congress
wrote
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
i
don't
understand
what
difference
that
makes.
i
mean,
in
both
cases
there
was
a
commitment
to
pay
the
contingent
fee.
it
was
a
promise.
and
when
the
money
was
collected,
the
court
said,
we're
going
to
enforce
an
equitable
lien
upon
your
recovery
in
order
to
comply
with
the
promise.
justice
antonin
scalia
take
it.
it's
a
good
one.
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
isn't
that
what
occurred
here?
what...
what's
the
essential
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
i
mean,
once
you
get
out
of
the
contract
terms
and
are
trying
to
make
your
case
on
the
basis
of
subrogation,
you
do
have
to
show
that...
that
part
of
the
recovery
was...
was
for
the...
for
the
medical
expenses.
and
has
that
been
shown?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
have
piqued
my
curiosity
and...
and
didn't
satisfy
it.
you
say
there
are
variations
on
make
whole.
what...
you
were
about
the
describe
the
variations.
what
are
the
variations?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fact
that
your
equitable
claim,
you
know,
traces
itself
to
a
contract
certainly
doesn't...
doesn't
cause
it
to
cease
to
be
an
equitable
claim.
i
mean,
the
classic
equitable
claim
is
somebody
declaring
a
trust
in
exchange
for
some
money,
and
he
declares
a
trust.
equity
will
enforce
that
trust,
but
the
trust
is
based
on
a
contractual
commitment.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
should
think
your
response
is
that
congress
provided
for
only
equitable
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
that
that's
the...
that's
the
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
said
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
you
might
try
to
get
erisa
amended.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
presumably
such
a
weak...
such
a
weak
claim
would
not
be
brought
because
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there's
nothing
at
the
end
of
it.
