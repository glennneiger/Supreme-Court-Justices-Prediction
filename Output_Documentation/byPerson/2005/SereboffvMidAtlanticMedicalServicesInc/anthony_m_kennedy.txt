i
don't
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i...
i
still
don't
understand.
if
i'm
the...
the
trial
judge
and
you
ask...
and
i'm
asked
to
enter
an
injunction,
i
enter
an
injunction
knowing
that
in
the
end
it's
going
to
be
to
no
purpose?
i
have
to...
i
have
to
be
enforcing
some
ultimate
injury
of...
of
which
the
plaintiff
has
standing
to
assert.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that's
why
i
don't
understand
your
questions.
i
would
think
you'd
say
no
injunction
because,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
amounts
to
nothing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
cite
us
to
something
for
the...
can
you
cite
something
to
that
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
your
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
california
allow
you
to
intervene
when
it
has
a
no
subrogation
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
how
are
you
going
to
prevent
the
funds
from
being
commingled
or
being
assigned
immediately
to
a
trust?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
not
sure
how
you
can
avoid
also
the
trustee
being
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
would
happen
if
this
case
were
a
weak
case
on...
on
liability
and
it
was
settled
for
$60,000?
what
would
happen
to
your
tracing
theory
then?
