mr.
peter
k.
stris
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
question
presented
today
is
whether
a
claim
for
contractual
reimbursement
is
cognizable
under
section
502(a)(3)
of
erisa.
in
this
case,
mamsi,
the
fiduciary
of
an
erisa
plan,
seeks
monetary
reimbursement
from
the
sereboffs,
two
beneficiaries
of
the
plan.
mamsi
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
its
money
claim
is
governed
exclusively
by
the
terms
of
its
contract
with
the
sereboffs.
this
contract
expressly
disclaims
and
replaces
most
equitable
principles.
at
its
core,
mamsi's
claim
is
nothing
more
than
a
request
for
money
damages.
this
claim
is
not
cognizable
under
erisa
because
mamsi
is
not
entitled
to
any
relief
that
was
typically
available
at
equity.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
what
i
would
say,
justice
souter,
is
that
an
injunction
to...
merely
to
prohibit
distribution
would
be
equitable
relief.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean,
however,
that
once
that
injunction
issued,
the
plan
could
enforce
the
terms
of
the
contract
under
erisa.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
it
could
enforce
the
injunction
provided
that...
that
the
injunction
was
not
a
mandatory
injunction.
this
court
in
greatwest
clearly
held
that
a
mandatory
injunction
under
502(a)(3),
saying
pay
us
this
money
that's
due
under
the
contract,
is
not--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--well--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i...
i
would
say
two
things,
justice
souter.
the
first
is
that,
respectfully,
i
don't
think
greatwest
made
the
distinction
that
a
mandatory
injunction
was
impermissible
because
it
was
ex
post.
i
think
greatwest
squarely
held
that
a
mandatory
injunction
is
just
a
clever
attempt
by
lawyers
to
enforce
a
contract
for
legal
damages.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
true,
your
honor,
because
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
mamsi
or
an
erisa
plan
doesn't
have
alternative
remedies.
of
course,
there...
that...
that
should...
that
consideration
should
be
irrelevant
because
either
the
claim
is
legal
or
equitable,
and
there
are
many
claims
that
beneficiaries
have
for
the
violation
of
a
plan
term
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--oh,
to
be
clear,
your
honor,
i
will
suggest
a
few
remedies
that
i
think
might
be
available
here.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that's
extremely
important
because
we
would
suggest--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that's
a
fair
point,
justice
kennedy,
but
that
doesn't--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--see,
i
don't
think
that's
true,
though,
because
there's
a
distinction
i'd
like
to
draw
between
having
a
remedy
under
502(a)(3)
of
erisa
and
having
a
remedy
at
all.
we
would
suggest
that
the
plan
can
intervene
in
the
state
court
suit.
we
would
suggest
that
the
plan
could
write
a
letter
to
the
tortfeasor
notifying
the
tortfeasor
that
it
has
a
subrogation
right,
and
if
the
tortfeasor
entered
into
a
release,
it
wouldn't
be
viable.
so
there
may
be
good
reason
for
the
federal
court
to
enter
the
injunction
that
you
suggested,
mr.
chief
justice,
merely
to
prevent
the
dissipation
of
the
funds
because
the
funds
might
need
to
be
preserved
for
a
separate
purpose.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that
does
not
resolve
the
present
case,
justice
scalia,
because
the...
mamsi's
interpretation
of
the
barnes
line
of
cases,
the
equitable
lien
by
assignment
cases,
would
entirely
negate
the
limitation
that
congress
put
into
502(a)(3).
and...
and
if
you'd
permit
me
to
explain
why.
a
remedy
of
an
equitable
lien
by
assignment,
as
we
explained
in
our
opening
brief,
is
not
a
restitutionary
remedy.
no
unjust
enrichment
need
be
proved.
no
tracing
need
be
proved.
it's
purely
a
contractual
remedy.
now,
as
a
result,
courts
of
equity
historically
developed
this
remedy
to
give
priority
to
one
creditor
over
another
if
there
was
a
present
intent
on
the
part
of
the
promisor
to
pledge
that
specific
property
as
security.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
don't--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--yes,
that's
fair,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
i
would...
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to...
to
page
211
of
the
greatwest
opinion,
note
1,
where
the
court
wrote
that
any
equitable
remedy
under
502(a)(3)
must...
and
i
quote...
be
deemed
to
contain
the
limitations
upon
its
availability
that
equity
typically
imposes.
and
my
only
point--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--my
only--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that...
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
and...
and
it...
it
proves
my
point
more
than
refutes
it,
and
here's
why.
greatwest
had
no...
this
court
in
greatwest
had
no
occasion
to
explain
when
something
was
traceable
or
when
it
belonged
in
good
conscience
to
the
plan.
it
merely
said
that
you
look
to
history
for
those
requirements.
and
this
is
why,
justice
scalia,
i
distinguish
between
equitable
restitution
and
an
equitable
lien
by
assignment.
they
were
both
typically
available
in
equity
as
narrow
exceptions
to
getting
money
for
breach
of
contract.
i
concede
that.
but
they
had
very
different
requirements,
neither
of
which
can
be
met
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
okay.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
you
don't
need
to
say
it.
i
know.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
the
answer
is
it
depends
and--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--it
depends,
and
that...
and
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--and
that
is
my
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question.
it...
it
depends
on
whether
the...
what
the
court
believed
the
intent
of
the
great
grandson
was
at
the
time
the
promise
was
made.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
then
to
be
clear,
your
honor,
that
would
not
be
enforceable
as
an
equitable
lien
by
assignment,
and
it's
important--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that's
correct.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
we...
we
cite
a...
we
cite
a
series
of
cases
in
our
reply
brief,
pages
12
and
13,
that
all
stand
for
this
principle.
and
it's
important
to
understand
why.
the
reason
why
is
equitable
lien
by
assignment
historically
only
occurred
in
cases
where
there
was...
for
the
most
part,
99
percent
of
the
times,
occurred
in
cases
where
there
was
insolvency.
so
the
fight
was
between
different
creditors.
and
the
question
was,
was
there
an
intent
to
merely
just
pay
this
debt
as
a
promise,
in
which
case
we
don't
give
priority
of...
of
the
ring
to
this
one
creditor,
or
was
there
the
intent
to
pledge
this
particular
piece
of
property
as
security,
in
which
case
we
will
give
it
as
priority?
and
i'd
like
to
take
a
step
back
because
i'm
concerned
that
this
comes
across
as
a
hypertechnical
argument,
but
it's
really
not
because
if
we
start
with
the
background
principle
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--if
there
were
no--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--if--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--the
answer
is
still
no.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
but...
but
i
would
add
to
that
there...
there
are
very
few
cases
in
that
area
because
in
that
area
the
person
would
usually
sue
at
law
for
money
damages.
if
they--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--yes.
that's
fair.
and
the
cases
that
do
arise,
arise
because
the
person
wants
that
specific
piece
of
property.
and
at
equity,
it
would
not
be
recoverable.
it
would
only
be
a
claim
for
money
damages
at
law.
now,
to
take
this--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--certainly,
your
honor,
and...
and
as
we
note
in
our...
in
our
reply
brief,
many
courts
over
the
years
have
described
barnes,
wylie,
and
the
other
attorney's
fees
cases
cited
by
mamsi
in
this
case
as...
as
very
narrow
exceptions
to
the
strict
rule
at
equity
because
in
attorney's
fees
cases,
it
was
the
attorney's
efforts
that
created
the
fund.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
rely
on
that
exception.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
to
be
clear,
your
honor,
we
don't
rely
on
the
distinction,
but
we
do
think
the
distinction
adds
some
persuasive
force,
and
here's
why.
my
understanding
is
that
these
courts
viewed
the
barnes
line
of
cases
as
a
hybrid
line
of
cases.
they're
willing
to
relax
slightly
the
very
strict
rules
at
equity
because
they
think
there's
an
element
of
unjust
enrichment.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
in
candor,
your
honor,
i
was
attempting
to
suggest
that
and
clearly
i
didn't
say
it
as
artfully.
but
that...
that
is...
that
is
what
i
meant--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--about
the--
[laughter]
i
will
take
it.
and
it
bleeds
very
nicely
into
what
i
was
about
to
say,
which
is
to
take
a
step
back
as
to
why
this
isn't
a
hypertechnical
argument.
it's
important
to
start
with
the
background
principle
that
502(a)(3)
doesn't
include
legal
relief,
and
this
is...
this
is
significant.
if
we
look
at
502(g),
there's
a
very
narrow
provision
for
plans
to
enforce
terms
that
require
certain
employers
to
make
contributions
to
plans,
and
in
502(g)
congress
said,
well,
in
this
case
you
can
seek
liquidated
damages
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan.
you
can
seek
legal
relief.
in
fact,
it
uses
the
phrase,
legal
and
equitable
relief.
so
when
we
sit
here
today
and
look
at
502(a)(3),
it's
very
easy,
particularly
on
the
facts
of
an
individual
case,
to
say,
hey,
you
know,
legal
relief
should
be
available
here.
but
congress
made
the
decision
only
to
allow
equitable
relief.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
is
arbitrary,
your
honor,
and
i
would
suggest
that
there's
two
reasons
why
they
did
that.
the
first
is
that
as
a
backdrop
rule
they
believed
that
it's
not
a
good
policy
to
have
fiduciaries
suing
participants
and
beneficiaries
for
money,
and
when
they
thought
that
there
was
a
good
reason
like
502(g),
they
expressly
enumerated
it.
the
second
reason
i
think
that
they...
they
did
this
is
because
the
only
times
when
it
might
make
sense
to
recover
money
for
the
violation
of
a
plan
term,
for
the
most
part,
fall
within...
under
the
rubric
of
unjust
enrichment.
and
i
believe
that
congress,
rightfully
so,
thought
that
there
were
sufficient
nonerisa
remedies
whereby
a
plan
could
assert
truly
equitable
unjust
enrichment
claims.
so
there
was
no
need
to
provide
that
remedy
in
the
civil
enforcement
provisions
of
erisa.
so
if
we
look
at
that
as
the
backdrop
rule
and
apply
it
to
barnes
and
that
line
of
cases,
i
would
suggest
that
mamsi's
reading
of
the
barnes
line
of
cases
is
very
dangerous.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i...
i
wasn't
suggesting
that
they
had
15th
and
16th
century
cases
in
mind.
certainly
not.
i
was
relying
on
those
cases
because
greatwest
mandates
that
that's
what
we
do.
but
i
do
believe
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--okay.
well,
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
why
we
believe
this
is
a...
a
legal
claim
and
not
an
equitable
claim.
if
we
look
at
the
particular
plan
provision
here,
it
allows
mamsi
to
totally
avoid
proving
any
double
recovery.
and
let
me...
let
me
give
an
example,
your
honor.
there
are
36
states
that
have
limited
the
collateral
source
rule.
under
the
mamsi
plan
here,
if
a
particular
plaintiff
recovered
money
in
a
personal
injury
suit,
it
clearly
could
not
recover
all,
in
some
of
the
states,
part
in
other
states,
of
its
advanced
medical
expenses
because
they
came
from
a
collateral
source.
nonetheless,
under
the
plan,
as
mamsi
has
written
it,
they
can
recover
their
full
amount,
and
there's
nothing
equitable
in
allowing
a
boiler
plate
provision
to
authorize
the
plan
to
get
contract
damages.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
i...
i
don't
know
how
simple
that
answer
is,
your
honor,
but
i
would...
i
would
take
it,
as
justice
scalia
said
a
moment
ago.
and
if
this
court
believes
that
mamsi
could
state
that
sort
of
equitable
claim,
we
would
be
very
comfortable
with
a
remand
in
this
case
to
weigh
the
equitable
factors
at
issue.
that
didn't
occur
here,
though,
because
mamsi
argued
that
the
contractual
terms
govern.
the
court
agreed.
and
so
as
a
result,
the
disclaimer
of
the
made
whole
doctrine,
the
requirement
that
mamsi
established
double
recovery--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that's
correct.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
right.
and...
and
i
would
suggest
that
at
equity,
whether
we
look
at
it
historically
or
even
in
a
modern
sense,
a
subrogation
based
claim
or
an
equitable
claim
would
require
mamsi
demonstrating
that
some
of
the
settlement
it
received
constituted
a
payment
for
medical
expenses.
and
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that's
true,
and...
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
that
occurred
and
you
applied
equitable
principles,
the
insurer
could
argue,
i
think
rightfully
so,
that
the
insurer
impaired
its
subrogation
rights.
that
would
be
an
equitable
claim.
the
point
i'm
making,
your
honor,
is
that
none
of
this
occurred
here
because
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
at
the
district
court
level
where
mamsi
went
in
and
said
all
that
matters
are
the
contract
terms.
we
don't
have
to
look
at
whether
the
sereboffs
were
made
whole.
we
don't
have
to
look
at
whether
there
was
double
recovery.
we
can't
consider
our
diligence
in
refusing--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--$750,000,
your
honor.
and...
and
i
would
suggest
that
we
never
had
an
opportunity
to
introduce
any
facts.
it--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--we
did
not,
but--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--yes.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
we...
yes.
i
mean--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i...
i
don't--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
don't
think
that's
true,
your
honor,
because
mamsi
didn't
move
for
summary
judgment
on
an
equitable
theory.
they
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
a
contractual
theory.
and
page
8
of
their
summary
judgment
motion
is...
is
particularly
clear
on
this.
it
makes
clear
that
the
contract
creates,
governs,
and
is
the
end
all
and
be
all
of
their
rights.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
don't
think
they
have
to
invoke
the
contract,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--not
under
502(a)(3),
but
certainly
under
other
principles.
equitable
principles
of
subrogation,
as
mamsi
repeatedly
describes
in
their
brief,
is
a
doctrine
that
is
governed
by
equity.
it's
created
wholly
apart
of
a
contract.
and
we
cite
numerous
cases
for
the
proposition
that
you
can
limit
by
contract--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that
is
a
very
difficult
question,
your
honor,
and
i
would--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--it
is
an
important
question,
and
i
would
answer
it
this
way.
i
would
say
that
that
hypothetical
presents
a
much
closer
question.
if
the
contract
merely
had
a
subrogation
provision
that
said
we
are
subrogated
and
the
plan
went
in
and
tried
to
enforce
that
provision
by
employing
equitable
principles,
seeking
equitable
remedies,
that
would
be
a
closer
question.
that
might
be
permissible
under
502(a)(3).
that's
not
what
occurred
here.
i
think
it
probably
wouldn't
be
permissible
because,
although
it
would
seek
an
equitable
remedy,
it
wouldn't
be
an
equitable
remedy
to--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--oh,
the
essential
difference
is
that
there
are
various
equitable
principles
that
were
categorically
applied
to
subrogation
claims,
including
reimbursement
versions
of
subrogation
claims.
and
they
could
not
be
disclaimed
or
overridden
by
contract.
the
burden
of
the
insurer
was
to
establish
that
there
was
a
double
recovery.
that's
part
of
the
claim.
the
burden
of
the
insurer
was
to
show
that
the
defendant,
the
insured,
was
made
whole.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
right,
but
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
would
be
that
if
it's
a
lie,
meaning
if
they
did
get
damages
for
medical
expenses,
you
couldn't
overcome
it
merely
by
saying
you
didn't
seek
them.
and
if
it's
true,
meaning
in
the...
in
the
tort
action
the
plaintiff
didn't
actually
seek
those
damages,
then
there
would
be
an
equitable
theory
called
impairment
of
a
subrogation
right
that
could
be
asserted.
but
this
is
significant.
this
isn't...
this
isn't
historical
minutia.
this
is
significant
because
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
whether
the
claim
is
equitable
or
really
just
a
dressed
up
claim
to
say,
hey,
you
breached
this
contract
provision
because
when
you
define
in
the
contract...
and
this
goes
to
your
jurisdictional
question,
justice
souter.
when
you
define
in
the
contract
the
very
contours
of
reimbursement,
all
you're
doing
is
mandating
contract
damages.
and
here,
it's
worse
than
that.
mamsi
expressly
disclaimed
the
make
whole
doctrine.
they
did
it
in
the
plan.
they...
in
their
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
they
cited
in
re
paris,
which
is
a
fourth
circuit
case
that
governs,
and
you
can
do
that.
and
even
before
this
court,
they
have...
their
footnotes
19
and
20
of
their...
of
their
brief...
they're
not...
they're
continuing
to
rely
on
their
ability
to
do
that
in
their
contract.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
would
say
two
things,
and
then
i
would...
if...
if
i'm
permitted,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
first,
i
would
say
that
that's
not
what's
being
requested
here,
and
if
mamsi
could
state
that
claim,
then
a
remand
is
required
so
they
can
proceed
on
that
theory.
the
second
thing
i
would
say,
though,
is
that
that
notion
runs
square
up
against
greatwest
because
greatwest
said
it
had
to
be
a
claim
that
was
traditionally
available
in
equity,
not
something
that
an
equity
court
would
have
jurisdiction
over
because
of
the
cleanup
doctrine,
not
something
that
could
come
into
an
equity
court
for
another
reason,
but
a
remedy
that
was
traditionally
equitable.
and
when
you're
looking
at
something
like
a
constructive
trust,
mamsi
is
correct
to
point
out
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
there's
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
a
constructive
trust
historically
was
an
equitable
remedy
that
was
available
in
an
equity
court
even
if
there
was
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
but
that
doesn't
win
the
day
for
mamsi.
they
still
have
to
prove
that
they
meet
the
requirements,
the
tracing
requirements,
which
don't
exist
here
in
this
breach
of
contract
case,
and
that's
why
that
remedy
is
not
available.
so,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
my
limited
time,
i'd
like
to
make
three
very
brief
points.
the
first
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
why
these
claims
are
never
permissible
under
502(a)(3).
and
i
think
it
comes
out
of
a...
a
concession
that
mr.
coleman
made
in
his
argument.
he
answered
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice...
and
you
said
that
they
would
have
had
this
equitable
right
without
any
plan
provision.
but,
hey,
they
put
the
plan
provision
in
because
that's
what
section
502(a)(3)
requires.
you
can
only
get
equitable
relief
to
remedy
the
violation
of
a
plan.
that's
why
these
claims
are
never
authorized
under
502(a)(3)
because
they're
not
really
to...
to
enforce
or
remedy
the
violation
of
a
plan
term.
more
importantly,
though,
that's
not
what
happened
here
because
in
this
contract
they
disclaimed
the
very
equitable
principles.
and
that
brings
me
to
my
second
point,
which
is
that
even
if
the
answer
to
the
question
we
presented
in
our
cert
petition
is
sometimes,
the
question
is
still
presented.
the
answer
to
the
question
could
be
that,
as
you
put
it,
justice
souter,
jurisdictionally
sometimes
these
claims
for
reimbursement
are
authorized,
and
the
sometimes
is
when
the
contract
doesn't
disclaim
equitable
principles
because
if
the
party
relies
on
the
contract
and
fails
to
establish
the
equitable
principles
that
make
the
remedy
equitable,
then
it's
nothing
more
than
a
breach
of
contract
damages
case.
and
mr.
coleman's
answer
was
very
interesting.
he
tried
to...
to
sort
of
squirm
out
of
that
by
suggesting
that,
no,
it's
equitable
because
this
was
a
preallocation
of
how
the
money
would
be
distributed.
well,
where
i'm
sitting,
that
looks
an
awful
like
a
liquidated
damages
provision
for
a
breach
of
contract.
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
a
liquidated
damages
provision,
but
this
court
has
squarely
held
that
that's
legal
relief
when
it's
for
a
breach
of
contract.
it's
prohibited
by
section
502(a)(3).
and
that
brings
me
to
my
final
point,
which
is
this.
just
because
the
source
of
the
claim
is
the
contract
doesn't
mean
that
there
can
never
be
an
equitable
remedy.
we
never
take
this
position,
justice
scalia.
but
what
it
does
mean
is
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
fit
within
one
of
the
narrow
exceptions
at
equity
for
an
equitable
remedy
if
they're
seeking
money
for
a
violation
of
a
plan
term.
and
i'll
close
by
saying
that
this
theory
of
lien
by
assignment
is
very
dangerous
because
it
is
not
restitution.
it
does
not
require
tracing.
plans
could
write
terms
in
that
say,
if
you
breach
this
provision
of
the
contract,
we
are
entitled
to
specific
funds
out
of
any
bank
account
that
you
may
have
in
the
bank
at
the
time
that
you
breach
the
contract.
under
their
theory
of
the
barnes
line
of
cases,
that
would
be
equitable
lien
by
assignment.
that
clearly
bars
legal
relief.
thank
you.
