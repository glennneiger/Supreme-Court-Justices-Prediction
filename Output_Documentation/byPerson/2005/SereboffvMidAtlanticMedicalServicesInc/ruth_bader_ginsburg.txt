justice
ruth
bader

well,
what
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
if
you're...
if
you're
using
greatwest,
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
relevant
point
made
in
greatwest
was
that
the
plan
could
seek
restitution
in
equity
where
money
identified
as
belonging
in
good
conscience
to
the
plan
could
clearly
be
traced
to
particular
funds
in...
in
the
defendant's
possession.
the
problem
in
greatwest
was
the
money
had
already
been
dissipated.
it
had
been
set
aside.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you...
do
you
not
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
no
compensatory
damages,
no
punitive
damages?
do
you
really
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
distinction
that
you
are
now
drawing
in
the
ring
case
based
on
15th
and
16th
century
english
precedent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
greatwest
also
said
money.
it
said
money,
identified
as
belonging
in
good
conscience
to
the
plan.
and
why
doesn't
it
belong
in
good
conscience
to
the
plan
when
the
beneficiary
has
promised
that,
if
it
gets
a
tort
recovery,
it
will
reimburse
the
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
is
the
double
recovery
that
you're
talking
about?
the
plan
has
paid
out
to
the
care
providers
the
benefits
in
full.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
now
it
wants
to
get
back
its
benefits
in
full.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
plaintiff
could
so...
in
the
tort
litigation,
if
that's
what
it
is,
the
plaintiff
could
say,
i
don't
want
any
medical
damages.
give
me
everything
for
pain
and
suffering.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
but
they
look
at
the
medical
expenses
were
something
like
$75,000
and
the
settlement
was...
what
was
it?
$750,000.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
the...
how
does
the
insurer
show
that
if
the
parties
could
just
say...
the
plaintiff
can
say,
i
am
the
master
of
my
complaint.
i
am
not
seeking
damages
for
medical
expenses.
i
just
want
damages
for
lost
earnings,
pain
and
suffering.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well...
well,
why
should
you
be
if...
if
an...
if
this...
if
you
prevail
in
this
case
and
then
every
other
personal
injury
lawyer
will
make
sure
that
that
recovery
goes
into
a
trust
for
the
care
of
the
accident
victims,
never
goes
into
their
own
investment
account.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
if
the
recovery
is
set
up
in
such
a
way
that
it
never
goes
into
the
personal
account
of
the
accident
victims
and,
instead,
just
what
happened
in
greatwest,
isn't
that
what
every
personal
injury
lawyer
will
do
if
you
prevail
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
even
if
you
had
an
early
neutral
evaluator
who
said
this
entire
claim
with
pain
and
suffering,
the
medical,
it's...
all
together
it's
$100,000.
there
was
some
contributory
negligence.
so
i
think
$80,000
would
be
right.
there
would
still
be
no
prorating--
