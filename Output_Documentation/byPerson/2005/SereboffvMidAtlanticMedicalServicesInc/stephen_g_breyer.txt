justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
in
the
18th
century...
i'm
not
an
expert
in
this.
you're
more
of
one.
but
suppose
you
had
an
absolute
classical
trust.
it's
the...
it's
a
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
fifth
grandchild
of
the
duke
of
hamilton.
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
the
trustee.
and
this
trustee,
going
to
the
fifth
grandchild
one
day,
lends
him
1,000
pounds,
and
he
takes
his
security.
the
grandchild
says,
4
years
from
now
my
great,
great
aunt
margaret
is
likely
to
die
and
she's
going
to
leave
me
my
ring...
her
ring.
and
the...
the
trustee
says,
fine.
when
you
get
the
ring,
give
it
to
me
and
that's
repayment.
yes,
okay,
done.
now,
the
great,
great
grandchild
being
a
bit
of
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
he
keeps
the
ring.
[laughter]
all
right.
my
question
is
could
the
trustee
go
to
the
equity
court
and
say,
there
it
is.
it's
in
his
pocket.
equity
court,
i'd
like
you
to
order
that
ring
to
be
given
to
the
trust.
can
that
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
depends.
they
couldn't
get
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it
depend
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
great
grandson's
intent
was
to
get
the
money
as
fast
as
he
could,
and,
in
fact,
he
thinks...
when
he'll
get
the
ring,
he
thinks
he'll
give
it
back
to
the
trust
but...
at
least...
yes.
that's
what
he
thinks.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
a
court
of
equity
could
not
have
taken
the
ring?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
like...
what
it
is
it?
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
15th
century
or
the
16th?
is
there...
is
there
a
case?
there
must
have
been
cases
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
there
are
no
other
creditors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
other
creditor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
he
goes...
there's
nobody.
all
there
is
is
the
ring.
nobody
else
makes
any
claim
to
it
whatsoever.
now
can
the...
can
the
trustee
get
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
he
has
no
money.
all
he
has
is
the
ring
in
his
pocket.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
just
said...
your
brother
said,
well...
because
i
simplified
that
to
the
ring,
and
he
says,
well,
if
in
fact
you
had
a
subrogation
right
or
some
other
absolutely
clear
contractual
right
to
get
repaid
from
the
ring,
you
know,
which
is
a
physical
thing,
you
couldn't...
stronger
than
your
case...
you
couldn't
get
it
in
equity.
if
i
really
knew
about
the
18th
century
cases,
i
would
realize
that,
and
it's
only
my
ignorance
that
and
my
dissent
that
prevents
me
from
understanding
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine.
then
where
do
i
look?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if...
if
you
understand
as
i...
that
four
people
on
the
court
took
a
broader
view
that
congress
didn't
want
to
get
into
this
matter,
and
restitution
is
restitution,
whatever
it
means
now;
that
five
took
the
historical
view.
now,
if
we're
in
the
historical
view,
which
we
are,
that
was
the
majority.
at
that
point,
i
want
to
know
how
you
think
this
case
should
come
out.
what
words
should
be
written
there
if
i'm
thinking
of
the
next
case?
and
after
you
win
this
case,
if
you
do,
the
next
case
will
simply
be
precisely
the
same
as
yours,
but
the
lawyers,
having
acted
5
minutes
quickly...
more
quickly,
will
mix
up
all
the
funds.
now
it's
commingled
and
all
we
have
is
exactly
the
same
with
every
future
case
that
you
have,
and
now
the
pension
fund
can't
get
a
penny
back
of
the
money
that
it
loaned
that
it
should
get
back
in
good
conscience.
no
doubt
about
it.
a
promise,
good
conscience,
and
they
can't
get
a
penny.
now,
you
have
the
interest
in
telling
me
what
words
this
court
should
write,
other
than
overrule
greatwestern,
that
will
prevent
that
result
from
coming
about.
i
would
like
to
know
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
other
words,
you
don't
care
about
these
other--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i
was
actually
interested
in
what
your
response
was
because
i
thought
you
have
an
interest
in
not
losing
your
recovery
in
all
those
other
cases.
