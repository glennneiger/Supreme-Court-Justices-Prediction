mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
subrogation
based
claims
have
always
been
fundamentally
equitable
in
nature
and
fit
comfortably
within
the
prescriptive
limits
of
section
502(a)(3).
the
court
should
reject
petitioners'
attempt
to
make
these
kind
of
subrogation
based
reimbursement
provisions
universally
unenforceable
in
erisa
plans.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it
has
been,
your
honor.
and...
and
let
me
make
clear
what
the
plan
says.
the
plan,
i
think,
does
three
things.
the
plan
memorializes
our
right
to
subrogation,
a...
a
right
that
has
existed
in
equity
in
modern
times
and
ancient
times
throughout
the
history
of
equity.
second--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
believe
that
he
does
cite
cases
disallowing
it
under
circumstances
anywhere
close
to
this.
he
did
cite
in
his
brief
trist
and
other
cases
from
his
reply
brief
that
this
court
in
barnes
expressly
disapproved.
and
so
in
suggesting
that...
that
there
is
not
somehow
an
equitable
right
that
attaches
to
this
type
of
a
plan
language,
we
think
that
on
that
additional
ground
that
fails.
this
type
of
a
claim
is
a
fundamentally
equitable
claim.
when
we
pay
over
the
medical
expenses,
we
obtain
a
right
in
equity
to
receive
an
amount
up
to
that
which
we
have
provided
to
the
petitioner.
our
plan
reflects
that
language.
our
plan
also
goes
on
to
say
that
it
contains
a
commitment
that
we
will
look
only
to
the
recovery,
to
the
fund
that
is
received
from
a
third
party
by
settlement
or
judgment.
we
think
that
that
fits
clearly
within
the
language
of
barnes,
that
we
are
committing
ourselves
to
a
recovery
that
will
look
only
to
the
funds
recovered.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
disagree
with
his
response.
i
think
the
ring
clearly
would
have
been
recoverable
in
equity
and
i...
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
reasonable
question
about
that.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
for
the...
for
the
ring
proposition?
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
do
think
the
barnes
line
of
cases
that
include
with
it
walker
v.
brown
and...
and
other
cases
fully
stand
for
that
type
of
a
proposition,
that...
that
if
you
have
committed
to
something
that...
that
requires
the
return
and
recovery
of
a
specific
item
or
fund,
that
is
it.
i
think
that
type
of
thing
would
also
fall
clearly
within
the
realm
of
specific
performance,
which
is
a
known
exception
to
contract
based
claims
that
fall
clearly
within...
within
the
realm
of
equity.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
because
the
right
to
subrogation
exists
independent
of
the
contract.
this
court
has
said
that
numerous
times.
we've
cited
cases
in
our
brief
going
back
into
the
1800's.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
because
of
the
specific
requirements
of
erisa
litigation.
502(a)(3)
doesn't
say
that
you
can
bring
any
claim
in
equity.
it
says
that
we
can
bring
a
claim
seeking
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
remedy
a
violation
of
the
plan
or
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan.
so
there
is
a
necessary
joining
of
equity
and
the
terms
of
the
plan
when
you
bring--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--we
believe
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
already
resolved
that
question,
and
that
is
that...
first
of
all,
there
are...
there
are
variations
on
make
whole.
theirs
is
only
one.
their
view
of
it
is
only
one,
which
is
the...
the
most--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
distinguish
between
the
two,
your
honor.
and
ultimately
the
reason
for
it
is,
is
that
a
third
part
of
the
plan
language
is
that
it
contains
essentially
a
preagreed
allocation.
that's
all
that
it
does.
it
says
because
of
the
risk
of
manipulation
in
these
settlements
where
the
insured
will
settle
a
third
party
claim
and
say,
okay,
it's
a
million
dollars,
but
let's
write
$10,000
in
for
medicals
and
the
rest
will
be
pain
and
suffering
because
we
don't
want
to
have
to
pay
back
on
subrogation,
so
it
is
well
established,
both
within
and
outside
the
erisa
context,
in
these
types
of
situations,
that
the
subrogation
language
will
contain
an
allocation
so
that
when
you
get
the
money
coming
back,
it
is
applied
first
to
the
medical
damages.
that
is...
that
is
all
that
it
is.
it
is...
it
is
not
something
that
exists
outside.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
we
would
be
entitled
to
it
under
the...
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
obviously,
in...
in
doing
these
things,
there's
a
practical
side
on...
on
the
business
side
when
they
work
these
things
out.
but
the
reason
that
claim
would
settled
for
$100,000
again
speaks
to
the
strength
of
their
claim
for
other
kinds
of
damages.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
again,
it's...
it's
because
of
the
nature
of
the
allocation.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it
is
because--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--yes.
courts
in
equity
in...
in...
modern
courts
in
equity
in...
in
analyzing
these
types
of...
of
claims
have
permitted
these
types
of
allocation--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
think
that's
an
accurate
statement
outside
of
the
erisa
context,
justice
stevens,
that
there
are
courts
that
enforce
one
form
of
make
whole
that
might
not.
but
there
are
many
states
that
do
enforce
a--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--there
are
variations
that...
the...
the
most
stringent
is
petitioners'
rule,
which
is
we
have
to
be
made
whole
for
everything
that
we
wanted
to
claim,
pain
and
suffering.
we
thought
our
claim
was
$1
million
and
we
didn't
settle
for
$1
million,
and
therefore,
we're
not
made
whole.
there
is...
there
is
another
version
that
is
less
restrictive
than
that,
but
as
long
as
there
is
a
showing
that
medical
expenses
have
been
paid,
you
get
a
return
of
medical
expenses.
there
are
another
version...
there's
another
version
that
is
enforced
in
many
states,
including
virginia
and
california
and
i...
some
others
i
believe,
in
which
essentially
the
make
whole
runs
the
other
way
towards
the
insurer,
that...
that
you
have
basically
a
first
dollar
type
to
ensure
that
the
medical
expenses
are
paid
first.
there
are...
there
are
a
variety
of
things,
but
within
the
erisa
context,
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
addressed
this
has
said
that
when
you
put
these
kinds
of
terms
into
the
plan...
and
they
are
very
common...
we're
not
going
to
adopt
from
various
states
equitable
rules
that
will
contradict
the
terms
of
the
plan
and
that
will--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
the...
the
plan
contains
an
allocation
agreement
that
is
part
of...
the
allocation
agreement
is
enforceable.
every
court
of
appeals
that
has...
has
ruled
on
this
issue
has
said
that
they
are,
that
they
are
not
going
to
adopt
state
rules
that
contradict
plan
terms
because
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
erisa
and
in
making
plan
sponsors
the...
the
governors
of
plan
design.
so
we
didn't
want
that
type
of
thing
to
happen.
every
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
that.
but
that...
that--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
believe...
i
believe
that
is
correct.
we
believe
that
it
runs
the
other
way,
that
our
plan
language
simply
reflects
an
age
old,
historical
subrogation
right
that
has
existed
in
equity
and
that
has
been
slightly
modified.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i'll
try
to
get
most
of
that
in
order.
first
of
all,
the
court
did...
has
ruled.
it's
an
issue
of
statutory
interpretation,
and
the
court
has
not
usually
gone
back
on
it.
we're
very
comfortable
with
mertens.
we're
comfortable
with
greatwest.
we
think--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
your
honor,
we
are
very
comfortable
within
the
law
that
this
court
has
set
out.
we
believe
that
the
court
has
gotten
it
right.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
your
honor,
that
presumes
that...
that
we
don't
have
things
that
we
can
do
along
the
way
before
it
comes
into
the
attorney's
hands.
this
is
a
very
interactive
process.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
justice
breyer's
example
is
one
specifically
related
to
commingling.
commingling
itself
does
not,
in
fact,
bar--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--but
if...
if
you
go
out
and,
you
know,
give
out
dollar
bills
on
the
street
till
it's
all
gone...
we
accept
that
there
are
limits
to
our
recovery.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the...
the
commingling
situation
is
one
in
which
the
courts
would
look
to
see
if
the
person
is
still
essentially
in
possession
of
the
funds
as
the
court
stated
in
greatwest.
we
think
under
that
circumstance
it
would
be.
i
can
envision
circumstances--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--yes,
absolutely.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
then,
justice
ginsburg,
we
would
test
the
language
at
the
end
of
greatwest
and
we
would
have
to
go
after
a
different
defendant.
and
we
would...
we
would
have
to
test
our
luck
under
that
type
of
situation,
go
after
the
person
in
possession
or
control
of
the
funds,
and
we
would
be
able
to
do
that.
and
we
believe
that
courts
would...
would
allow
that
and
would
enforce
our
equitable
rights
in
that
type
of
a
situation.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
there,
i
believe
there's
a
strong
argument
that
california
might
not
have
permitted
us
to
intervene
at
all.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
there
are--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i...
i
think
that
our
remedy
is
under
(a)(3),
your
honor,
and
that
we
would...
we
would
try
to
act
under
(a)(3)
in
terms
of
enforcing
our
equitable
rights
that
exist.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i'm
sure
you'll
wish
us
luck
with
that,
justice
scalia.
but
i
think
that
our
rights
are
sufficiently
secure
under
erisa
as
it
is
now
written
and
under
the
jurisprudence
that
this
court
has
set
forward.
we
believe
that
our
plan
sufficiently
captures
the
essence
of
the
age
old
equitable
subrogation
right,
that
in
seeking
to
enforce
that
plan,
we
both
capture
those
subrogation
based
rights,
but
our
plan
also
commits
to
seek
funds
solely
from
a
fund,
a
res,
that
will
come
into
existence
as
a
result
of
the
third
party
litigation--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--we
have
a
right
that
exists
in
equity
independent
of
the
plan,
but
(a)(3)
does
have
that
language
that
you
seek
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan.
that
part
of
it
might
be
missing
if
we
were
just
out
relying
solely
on
what
exists
in
equity,
separate
from
the
plan.
that
is
why
the
plan
memorializes
these
rights.
it
was
congress'
intent
that
we
write
the
terms
into
the
plan
so
that
people
can
be
given
notice
of
what
is
there
and
they
can
accept
it.
they
can
understand
what
is
in
the
plan.
and
as
long
as
our
plan
is
consistent
with...
and
we
believe
it
is...
in
seeking
what
is
appropriate
equitable
relief,
then
we
think
that
the
courts
have
authority
to
hear
these
claims.
and
really,
there's
a
lot
that's
been
discussed
here,
but
the
question
that
has
been
presented
to
the
court
is
really
only
does
(a)(3)
authorize
these
types
of
claims.
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
yes,
and
in
asserting
that
a
court
should
have
enforced
or
should
have
looked
at
various
equitable
defenses,
we
think
that's
merely
a
concession
that
our
claim
is
equitable
in
nature
and
that
in
asserting
these
various
defenses,
that...
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
unanimously
thus
far
rejected,
the
court
does
not
need
to
look
at
it.
those
courts
have
correctly
decided
all
of
those
issues
in...
in
evaluating
the...
the
balancing
of
congress'
intent
in
enacting
erisa
and
putting
these
kinds
of
terms
into
play,
allowing
plan
sponsors
to
have
a
lot
of
deference
and
leeway
over
how
plans
are
designed
and
then
enforcing
them
under
(a)(3)
in
seeking
equitable
relief.
and
we
believe
that
the
fourth
circuit
properly
evaluated
that
and
that
the
court's
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
