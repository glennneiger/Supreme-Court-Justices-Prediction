chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
sereboff
v.
mid
atlantic
medical
services.
mr.
stris.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
an
injunction
pending
litigation?
is
that
the
idea
just
until
you
resolve
whatever
claim
it
is
they
have
to...
to
the
money,
determine
it.
it
may
be
a
legal
claim,
an
equitable
claim,
but
until
you
sort
it
out,
you
can
get
an
injunction
to
prevent
them
from
dissipating
the...
the
claimed
funds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
get
back
to
the...
the
barnes
case
that
justice
scalia
asked
you
about?
is
it
a
possible
distinction
of
that
case
that
that
involved
a
contingent
fee
arrangement,
and
in
other
words,
the
lawyer's
labors
generated
the...
the
asset,
while
in
this
case,
the
claim
depends
upon
the...
the
contractual
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
may
not...
you
may
not
rely
on
the
distinction,
but
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
might
have
been
that
the
lawyer
had
an
equitable
claim
apart
from
the
contractual
provisions
so
that
when
you
enforce
the
contractual
provisions,
justice
holmes
would
have
thought
of
it
in
equitable
terms,
while
here,
there's
no
equitable
claim
apart
from
the
particular
provisions
of
the
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
why
is
that?
i
mean,
we
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
these
old
english
cases.
why...
why
did
congress...
it
seems
an
arbitrary
line.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stris.
mr.
coleman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
i
can
just
stop
you
there.
your...
your
friend
on
the
other
side
cites
the
many
common
law
cases
not
allowing
subrogation
in
this
sort
of
situation,
or
if
it
does
allow
it,
subject
to
the
make
whole
doctrine.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
instead
of
looking
for
an
equitable
counterpart,
this
is
an
action
for
money
you
think
is
owing
to
you
under
a
contract.
why
isn't
that
a
classic
form
of
legal
relief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
did
you
cite
the
contract
in
your
complaint?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
equity...
if
the
equitable
subrogation
claim
were
subject
to
the
make
whole
doctrine
or...
or
these
other
equitable
doctrines,
and
your
contractual
claim
is
not,
which
relief
are
you
entitled
to?
the...
the
one
subject
to
the
equitable
doctrines
or
the
relief
that's
specified
in
your
contract?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your
claim
subject
to
the
equitable
doctrines
or
subject
to
the
legal
contractual
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
it
seems
to
me
you...
you
must
be
biting
your...
your
tongue
here.
there's
an
easy
answer
to
justice
stevens
and
to
justice
scalia,
and
it's
that
we
get
all
the
money
first
because
that's
what
the
contract
says.
but
you
can't
give
that
answer
because
then
it
starts
to
look
like
a
legal
claim.
instead,
you
get
mired
in
all
these
obscure
equitable
doctrines
because
you're...
when
there's
a
simple
answer
there
in
black
and
white,
but
it's
in
the
contract.
and
as
soon
as
you
say
that,
it
starts
to
sound
legal
rather
than
equitable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
theory
is
that
your
argument
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
you
did
not
have
this
provision
in
your
contract.
it's
an
equitable
claim.
it's
an
age
old
subrogation
right.
you
just
sue
in
equity
saying,
look,
i
paid
the
medical
expenses,
i'm
entitled
to
it.
you
don't
need
the
contractual
provision
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
this...
to
go
to
your
first
point,
how
is
this
specifically
identifiable?
no
court
has
said
that
there's
this...
you
only
want
the
medical
expenses,
and
no
court
has
said
there's
this
much
for
medical
expenses.
you
have
to
figure
out
how
much
of
the
recovery
is
allocable
to
medical
expenses.
in
fact,
already
did
that.
they
cut
out
some
percentage
for
attorney's
fees.
it's
far
removed
from
the
traditional
sort
of
res
that
we
deal
with
in
equity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we...
how
enforced?
i
mean,
if
you're
enforcing
a
contract,
you
do
that
legally
not
equitably.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
these
claims
subject
to
the
qualifications
that
go
along
with
the
equitable
lien,
the
make
whole,
whatever
the
applicable
rules
are?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
wouldn't
apply
here
because
you're
relying
on
the
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
the
plan
said...
you
know,
this
is
an
insurance
company.
they
don't
like
litigation...
we
are
subrogated
to
double
whatever
the
medical
expenses
are
that
we
contributed?
that's
our
recovery.
it's
an
equitable
claim,
but
it's
going
to
be
enforced
according
to
the
terms
of
the
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
would
still
call
that
an
equitable
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
stris,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stris.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
also
have
the
opinion
in
no.
05-260,
sereboff
versus
mid
atlantic
medical
services.
marlene
sereboff’s
employer
sponsors
a
health-insurance
plan
administered
by
mid
atlantic
medical
services.
mrs.
sereboff
and
her
husband
are
covered
beneficiaries
under
this
plan.
so
when
they
were
involved
in
a
car
accident
and
suffered
injuries,
the
plan
paid
their
medical
expenses.
the
sereboffs
later
sued
in
state
court
other
people
who
were
involved
in
the
accident
and
eventually
received
a
substantial
settlement.
mid
atlantic,
the
insurance-plan
administrator,
then
sued
the
sereboffs
in
federal
court,
relying
on
a
provision
in
the
insurance
plan
that
required
beneficiaries
to
reimburse
the
plan
for
medical
payments
whenever
the
beneficiaries
recovered
for
their
injuries
from
a
third
party.
the
sereboffs
opposed
mid
atlantic’s
claim,
but
agreed
to
set
aside
in
an
investment
account
a
portion
of
the
state
court’s
settlement
equal
to
the
medical
bills
that
mid
atlantic
had
paid
until
the
courts
determined
whether
mid
atlantic
was
entitled
to
recover.
now,
whether
mid
atlantic
can
get
back
what
it
paid
the
sereboffs
turns
on
the
interpretation
of
the
employee
retirement
and
income
security
act,
or
erisa.
a
provision
of
that
law
allows
parties
like
mid
atlantic
to
bring
actions
in
federal
court
for,
“equitable
relief
to
enforce
the
terms
of
a
plan”.
now,
that
provision
could
be
called
the
legal
historians
relief
act,
because
it
requires
courts
to
harken
back
to
the
time
of
the
so-called
divided
bench,
when
courts
sat
either
as
a
court
of
equity
or
a
court
of
law,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
suit.
we
have
to
sort
through
the
old
cases
and
determine
whether
mid
atlantic’s
suit,
had
it
been
brought
during
the
time
of
the
divided
bench,
would
have
been
brought
in
equity
or
at
law,
because
erisa
allows
suits
only
for
equitable
relief.
the
sereboffs
argue
that
mid
atlantic
is
just
seeking
damages
for
breach
of
contract,
an
action
that
would
have
been
brought
on
the
law
side
of
the
divided
bench.
like
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
we
disagree.
mid
atlantic
is
claiming
entitlement
to
a
specific
fund
over
which
it
has
an
equitable
claim,
that
portion
of
the
sereboffs’
settlement
recovery
set
aside
owing
to
mid
atlantic
under
the
terms
of
the
insurance
plan.
mid
atlantic
has
an
equitable
lien
on
that
specific
fund
and,
in
the
days
of
the
divided
bench,
could
have
enforced
that
claim
on
the
equity
side
of
the
court.
it
may
therefore
proceed
today
under
erisa.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
