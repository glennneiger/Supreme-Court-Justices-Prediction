let's
examine
them.
what
if
it
definitely
goes
so
far
as
to
allow
no
other
use
of
this
natural
law
that
it's
discovered?
it
definitely
goes
that
far,
isn't
definiteness
fully
satisfied?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
could
see
how
that
broad
interpretation
would
raise
perhaps
for
the...
clearly
raise
for
the
first
time
the
section
101
issue.
but,
so
that
should
have
been
clear
to
you
by
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
decision
came
out,
right?
but
did
you,
in
your
petition
here,
rely
on
101?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
never
mentioned
101,
though,
did
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
we
do
what
the
solicitor
general
proposed,
that
is,
since
we
don't
know
for
sure,
at
least
i
don't
know
for
sure,
i'm
not
enough
of
a
scientist,
whether
in
fact
the
section
112
determination,
as
made
by
the
federal
court,
excludes
all
other
possible
use
of
this
natural
phenomenon.
since
i
don't
know
that
for
sure,
why
shouldn't
i
tell
the
federal
circuit,
you
know,
your
definition
of
correlate
raises
this
issue
and
you
should
resolve
whether
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
other
possible
usefulness
for
this,
no
substantial
usefulness?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
made
by
man
here?
i
mean,
if
you're
talking
about
the
type
of
assay
that
your
client
developed,
which
was
involved
in
other
claims,
not
in
13,
they
might
say,
yeah,
that
was
made
by
man.
but
here,
what
13
involves
is
simply
discovery
of
the
natural
principle
that
when
one,
when
there
is
the
presence
of
one
substance
in
a
human
being,
there
is
a
deficiency
of
two
other
ones.
that's
just
a
natural
principle.
what's
made
by
man
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
way
found
elsewhere
if
indeed
the
federal
circuit
had
determined
the
second
step,
you
know,
step
1,
do
the
assay,
step
2,
correlate.
if
the
federal
circuit
had
said,
oh,
that
requires
your
using
a
scale
to
see
how
much
of
one
there
is
and
how
little
of
the
other,
but
this
federal
circuit
says,
all
correlate
means
is
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
when
one
substance
is
high,
the
other
two
are
going
to
be
low.
that's
all
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
please
don't
get
off
it...
because
this
is
my
biggest
problem
with
the
case.
i
agree
that
what
you've
said
is
simply
a
statement
of
the
natural
phenomenon,
that
when
the
one
substance
is
high,
the
other
two
are
low.
and
simply
to
be
aware
of
that
natural
phenomenon
is
all
that
correlation
consists
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
life
isn't
a
fountain?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
weren't
112
and
101
combined
at
that
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
disagree
with
that?
