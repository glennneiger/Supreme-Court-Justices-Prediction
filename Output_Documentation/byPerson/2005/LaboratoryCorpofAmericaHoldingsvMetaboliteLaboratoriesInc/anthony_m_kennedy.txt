is
that
second
point...
is
that
second
point
definiteness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
definiteness
describe
this
second
aspect
that
you've
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
part
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
indefinite
because
we
don't
know
where
our
thoughts
will
take
us?
suppose
there
a
patent
which
requires
looking
at
the
clouds
in
the
sky
for
10
minutes.
i
mean,
that's
maybe
absurd,
but
it's
certainly
definite.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
in
the
appendix
begins
discussion
of
claim
13
about
page
16a.
are
there
some,
one
or
two
sentences
there
or
a
paragraph
that
you
can
tell
me
is
completely
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
you're
asking
us
to
reverse
this
court
of
appeals
decision
and
i'm
looking,
and
particularly
with
reference
to
claim
13,
the
one
we're
talking
about,
i
assume,
and
i'm
looking
through
pages,
say,
16
and
21
to
find
something
that's
absolutely
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
me
to
tell
the
court
of
appeals,
well,
you
can't
do
this.
but
where
is
it
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
can't
point
me
to
any
particular
sentence
that
would
say
that's
absolutely
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
where
does
it
say
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
see
my
point?
i'm
not
sure
what
it
is
you
want
me
to
say
went
wrong,
other
than
the
fact
that
this
patent
is,
should
never
have
been
granted
to
begin
with
but
that
wasn't
raised.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there
is
some
likelihood
or
possibility
of
this
that
we
should
assess,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
imprudent
for
us
to
discuss
it
here
when
it
hasn't
been
discussed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
urging
on
us
something
like
plain
error,
is
about
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
agree
or
you
submit
that
you
can
have
a
definite
description
of
something
that's
unpatentable
because
it's
too
broad?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
but,
but...
well,
let's
assume
that
there
is
a
claim
that
includes
something
that
should
not
be
patentable,
because
it's
too
broad
or
it
involves
the
scientific
phenomena,
the
mechanics
of
the
universe.
can
a
patent
still
be
definite
if
it
includes
that
sort
of
unpatentable
claim?
