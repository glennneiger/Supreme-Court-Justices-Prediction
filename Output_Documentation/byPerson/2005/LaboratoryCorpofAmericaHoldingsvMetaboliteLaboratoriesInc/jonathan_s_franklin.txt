mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
patent
claim
at
issue
in
this
case
was
held
to
be
infringed
whenever
any
doctor
looks
at
a
homocysteine
test
result
and
reflexively
thinks
about
a
basic
natural
correlation.
the
result
has
been
multimillion
dollar
damages
and
an
injunction
prohibiting
a
testing
company
from
conducting
important
homocysteine
tests
by
any
method
and
for
any
reason
whatsoever.
as
broadly
construed
by
the
federal
circuit,
this
claim
is
invalid
as
a
matter
of
law
for
two
closely
related
reasons.
it
contravenes
both
of
this
court's
settled
proscription
against
effectively
patenting
laws
of
nature
or
natural
phenomena
as
well
as
the
requirement
that
a
patent
must
fully
and
clearly
describe,
disclose
and
enable
an
actual
invention
and
must
not
sweep
so
far
as
to
encompass
more
than
what
was
actually
invented.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
the
second
point
is
definiteness,
it's
enablement.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
it
describes
part
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
there
is
definiteness,
there
is
enablement,
there
is
written
description.
we
think
all
of
those
are
contravened
here.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--definiteness
would
still
require
that
you
distinctly
claim
an
invention
here
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that's
absent
in
this
case.
but
even
moving
beyond
that,
your
honor--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
your
honor,
if
it
is
definite,
then
it
is
certainly
not
enabling
of
an
actual
invention.
and
here
the
morse
case,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs,
comes
into
play.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
samuel
morse
was
entitled
to
patent
his
innovative
telegraph
but
he
couldn't
go
further
to
effectively
patent
the
law
of
nature
or
natural
phenomenon
associated
with
it
and
thereby
monopolize
all
manner
of
devices
and
processes
that
he
did
not
invent
and
did
not
enable
or
describe.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
but
it
was
not
just
definiteness,
your
honor.
it
was
section
112.
but
let
me
get
to
the
morse
case
because
as
we
have
explained
in
our
reply
brief
and,
in
fact,
in
our
opening
brief,
the
morse
case
was
in
fact
decided
under
what
is
now
section
112.
the
court
cited
and
quoted
the
relevant
statute
which
has
not
changed
in
any
material
respect
today.
the
court
made
clear
that
the
problem
in
that
case,
at
page
120
of
the
opinion,
was
that
morse
claims
what
he
has
not
described
in
the
manner
required
by
law.
and
what
we
have
here
is
the
same
situation.
we
have
these
patentees
who
are
indisputably
entitled
to
patent
their
innovative
method
for
measuring
homocysteine.
and
labcorp
continues
to
use
that
method
sometimes
and
we
pay
royalties
whenever
we
use
that
method.
but
what
they
couldn't
do
is
what
samuel
morse
tried
to
do
and
push
the
envelope,
and
try
to
effectively
patent
the
natural
phenomenon
associated
with
all
homocysteine
tests
and
thereby
gain
a
monopoly
over
just
not
the
one
that
they
invented,
not
just
those
that
are
in
the
prior
art,
which
itself
would
be
impermissible,
but
even
yet
to
be
invented
assays.
and
here
is
the
nub
of
this
case.
labcorp
has
sought
to
use
but
has
been
penalized
for
using
and
is
prevented
from
using
a
more
efficient
and
cost
effective
method
for
assaying
homocysteine
than
the
one
that
these
patentees
invented.
the
method
that
labcorp
seeks
to
use,
which
is
the
abbott
method,
reduces
the
processing
time
for
homocysteine
tests
down
from
what
was
up
to
18
hours
under
the
patentee's
method
down
to
a
manner
of
minutes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
actually,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
and,
i
just
don't
know
whether
it's
patented
but
it
is
certainly
not
covered
by
their
claims
1
through
12,
which
have
never
been...
well,
the
district
court
found
that
those
claims
didn't
apply
here,
and
that's
not
an
issue.
the
abbott
method
is
different.
it's
an
immunoassay.
it
is
not
the
same
kind
of
mass
spectometry
gas
chromatograph
method
that
they
have
described.
it's
much
more
efficient,
it's
much
more
cost
effective
and
the
reason
obviously
that
labcorp
wants
to
use
that
method
is
to
more
effectively
serve
patients
and
their
doctors
and
to
meet
the
burgeoning
demand
for
homocysteine
tests.
but
because
these
patentees
have
effectively
claimed
the
patent
on
the
natural
correlation
that's
associated
with
all
homocysteine
tests,
they
have
prevented
labcorp
from
using
what
the
patent
laws
would
seek
to
encourage,
that
is,
a
more
cost
effective,
innovative,
different
method,
the
kind
of
thing...
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
morse.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
in
the
federal
circuit's--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
i
think
what--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i
think
where
it's
wrong,
your
honor,
is
that
it
proceeds
from
an
assumption
that
is
wrong
in
itself
and
that
is--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i
think
that
the
argument
in...
the
federal
circuit's
decision
is
wrong
in
its
enablement
discussion,
it's
wrong
in
its
written
description
discussion.
i
mean,
just
to
take
one,
the
written
description
posits
that
this
is
a
valid
written
description
because
the
inventors,
as
the
federal
circuit
says
in
its
opinion,
possessed
the
correlating
step.
and
i
think
what's
wrong
about
that,
your
honor,
is
that
nobody
can
possess
the
correlation.
and
that's
the
nub
of
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i'm
sorry,
that
is
at
page...
i
believe
it's
at
17
of
the
appendix.
let
me
just
make
sure
i've
got
the
right...
that
was
where
the
court
talks
about--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
i
think
it
was
raised,
your
honor.
the
validity
issue
was
raised
in
the
district
court,
it
was
raised
on
appeal.
the
district
court
had
construed
the
patent
as
requiring...
and
part
of
the
district
court's
claim
construction
addressed
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
one
could
patent
a
law
of
nature
or
effectively
patent
a
scientific
idea.
the
district
court
said
this
patent
must
require
something
more,
and
that
is
at
joint
appendix
page
60.
it
must
require
something
more
than
simple
existence
of
the
relationship
between
homocysteine
and
vitamin
deficiencies.
and
one
of
the
places
that
the
federal
circuit
did
get
it
wrong,
your
honor,
was
in
abandoning
that
limitation
that
the
district
court
had
imposed
on
the
patent.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
absolutely,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
what
we're
arguing.
and
that's
where
the
federal
circuit
got
it
wrong.
and
we
did
in
fact
urge
the
court--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
we
did
say
that.
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
diehr,
which--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
it
was
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
it
was
also
in,
with
the
premise
of
everything
that
we
argued,
because
the
district
court
had
already...
and
again,
i
point
the
court
to
joint
appendix
page
60.
the
district
court
had
already
held
that
it
had
to
mean...
the
patent
had
to
mean
something
more
than
the
simple
relationship,
the
simple
existence
of
the
relationship
between
elevated
homocysteine
and
vitamin
deficiencies.
and
the
premise
of
the
entire
federal
circuit
argument
and,
in
fact,
to
the
arguments
below
was
that
we
don't
know
what
that
anything
is,
because
the
patent
doesn't
tell
you.
the
federal
circuit
blew
past
that,
your
honor,
and
what
the
federal
circuit
said,
which
makes
the
issue
front
and
center
now,
is
the
federal
circuit
said,
and
this
is
at
18a.
"the
correlating
step
is
a
simple
conclusion
that
a
cobalamin/folate
deficiency
exists
vel
non
based
on
the
assaying
step.
"
and
what
that
means
is
now,
as
a
result
of
the
federal
circuit's
decision,
unlike
the
district
court's
decision,
we
now
know
that
every
homocysteine
test
automatically
infringes
because
every
doctor
will
reflexively
look
at
it
and
think
about
the
phenomenon
associated
with
it.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
we
don't
know
and
that's
why
it
wasn't
adequate.
that's
why
we
had
always
argued
under
indefiniteness
and
under
enablement,
under
the
written
description.
we
had
no
idea.
the
patent
doesn't
tell
you.
we
suggested
one
way.
that
wasn't...
the
federal
circuit
didn't
agree
with
us.
the
problem
with
the
district
court's...
we
agreed
with
the
district
court's
claim
construction.
that
far,
we
did.
but
then
there
was
nothing
more
even
adduced
at
trial,
and
this
was
the
argument
we
consistently
made.
the
federal
circuit
then
abandoned
what
the
district
court
did
and
then
we
here
have
at
front
and
center--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
it
did,
but
the
claim
construction
is
the
part
of
what
i'm
talking
about.
at
page
60,
i'll
just
read
what
the
district
court
said.
"correlating
is
a
verb
and
must
mean
more
than
the
simple
existence
of
a
relationship
between
a
high
level
homocysteine
and
deficiency
in
cobalamin
or
folate.
"
the
federal
circuit's
opinion
is
contrary
to
that,
your
honor,
and
that's
where
this
whole
issue
gets
put
front
and
center
now.
and
what
we
have
here
under
the
federal
circuit's
extraordinarily
broad
construction
is
we
have
nothing
more
than
the
reflexive
mental
recognition
of
a
natural
correlation
preceded
by
the
inherent
and
generic
step
of
somehow
ascertaining
the
input
for
that
correlation.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
we
relied,
your
honor,
on
all
of,
many,
many
cases
interpreting
that
provision
and
others
under
the
law
of
nature--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--we
didn't
but
just
as
an
example,
your
honor.
the
court's
invitation
or,
to
the
solicitor
general
didn't
mention
101,
but
everybody
knew
what
the
court
was
talking
about.
and
let
me
just...
the
petition
couldn't
have
raised...
the
petition
squarely
raised
the
issue.
on
page
18,
we
cited
diamond
versus
diehr,
benson,
funk
brothers,
mackay
radio
and
the
le
roy
case
from
1852.
on
page
26,
we
cited,
quoted,
relied
on
funk
brothers
and
mackay
radio
again.
page
27
refers
back
to
the
authorities
at
page
18
of
the
petition.
page
28
states
that
under
the
federal
circuit's
holding,
anyone
who
claims
to
be
the
first
to
discover
scientific
correlation
could
patent
it
simply
by
drafting
the
vague
test
plus
correlate
claim.
this
issue
was
presented
in
the
petition.
it
is
within
the
question
presented.
and,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
issue
is
easy
to
resolve
given
the
federal
circuit's
broad
construction.
under
that
construction,
again,
there
is
nothing
more
than
the
recognition
of
the
natural
phenomenon
preceded
by
what
is
the
inherent
step
in
any
natural
correlation
of
ascertaining
the
input.
and
as
we
have
said
without
contradiction
in
the
opening
brief,
if
this
patent
is
valid,
then
anyone
can
gain
a
patent
over
a
scientific
correlation
by
doing
this
kind
of
artful
drafting.
einstein
could
have
patented
e=mc2
which
this
court
has
stated
on
more
than
one
occasion
could
not
be
patented
simply
by
doing
a
test
plus
correlate.
to
take
another
hypothetical
that
was
stated
in
the
opening
brief
without
contradiction,
if
i
discover
tomorrow
a
new
correlation
between
having
a
certain
kind
of
blood
type
and
a
medical
condition
that
heretofore
people
do
not
know
about,
i
could
run
down
to
the
patent
office,
patent
that
correlation
and
the
effect
of
that
would
be
to
monopolize
all
blood
typing,
no
matter
whether
it's
done
through
methods
in
the
prior
art
or
methods
yet
to
be
developed.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
they
don't
mention
all...
the
number
but
i
don't
think
it
would
call
into
question
a
huge
swath
of
patents.
it
would
call
into
question
patents
that
are
like
this
one,
obviously,
things
that
are
simply
test
plus
correlate.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no.
you
would
have
to
do
an
exhaustive
search.
there
are
some
and
i
believe
that
some
of
the
ones
that
the
respondents
cite,
some
of
the
claims...
and
let's
distinguish
between
patents
and
claims
here,
because
it
might
invalidate
some
claims
in
some
patents,
which
is
not
unusual
because
patent
drafters
often
push
the
envelope.
the
patentors
in
this
case,
they
have
indisputably
unchallenged
and
valid
patent
claims
for
a
method
of
measuring
homocysteine,
but
they
went
further
in
claim
13.
and
to
the
extent
there
are
other
patents
that
might
have
those
kind
of
claims,
yes.
but
to
the
extent
we're
talking
about
the
broader
swath
of
patents
dealing
with
things
like
genes,
no.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i
think,
well,
it
was,
again,
it
was
pressed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
again,
what
we're
talking
about
is
deciding
this
case
on
its
facts
and
obviously
to
the
extent
there
are
other
patents
that
are
just
like
this
one,
and
the
court
has
addressed
this
in
the
context
of
flook
and
diehr
and
has
distinguished
between
those
patents
which
facially
looked
rather
similar
but
the
court
was
able
to
draw
the
distinctions.
the
federal
circuit
can
draw
the
distinctions.
but
if
it
is
a
patent
that
is
simply
like
this
one,
which
claims
nothing
more
than
a
natural
correlation
preceded
by
the
inherent
step
of
ascertaining
the
input,
no
court,
to
my
knowledge,
has
ever
upheld
such
a
patent
before
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no,
i
think
that
we're
urging
the
court
to
examine
the
case
that
it
has
before
it,
look
at
the
patent
and
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
go
further
than
this
patent.
look
at
this
patent,
look
at
the
federal
circuit's
construction
and
that's
something
that
we
will
take
as
a
given
for
purposes
of
today's
proceeding.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i'm...
excuse
me,
justice.
and
again,
i
wanted,
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
alito,
you
do
need
to
distinguish
between
patents
and
claims.
and
claim
13
is
the
only
claim
that's
been
asserted
here.
it's
the
only
claim
that's
being
challenged.
and
let
me
just--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--quite
simply,
your
honor,
it's
because
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
that
issue
and
didn't
need
to
reach
it
in
any
of
its
prior
cases
save
one
and
that's
the
benson
case
where
that
issue
came
up
really
in
one
sentence
of
the
opinion.
in
the
morse
case,
in
the
funk
brothers
case,
in
the
flook
case,
all
of
those
patents
had...
were
limited
to
a
particular
use.
just
take
morse's
patent
which
was
limited
to
just
conveying
information
at
a
distance
through
electromagnetism.
that
was
actually
one
very
small
sliver
of
what
you
can
do
with
electromagnetism.
it's
that,
very,
very
small.
and
the
court
said,
no,
it
doesn't
matter.
where
what
you
have
is
effectively
the
patent
on
the
correlation,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
can
limit
it
to
one
use
or
many
uses.
so
if
the
court...
so
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
get
into
that.
in
diehr,
the
court
made
that
explicit
that
a
field
of
use...
limiting
a
patent
to
a
field
of
use
is
not
going
to
save
that
patent
from
invalidity.
now,
if
the
court
does
examine
the
issue,
it
ought
to
do
it
the
way
it
did
it
in
benson
just
by
looking
at
the
broad
sweep
here.
and
how
i
would
use
it,
your
honor,
would
be
to
say
that
in
addition
to
all
of
the
other
problems
that
this
patent,
as
construed
by
the
federal
circuit,
has,
it
also
has
an
extraordinarily
broad
pre
emptive
sweep.
it
applies
to
any
homocysteine
test,
no
matter
how
it's
done,
no
matter
what
reason
it's
done,
no
matter
if
it's
in
the
prior
art,
no
matter
if
i
invent
it
tomorrow.
it
applies
to
any
act
of
even
looking
at
the
test.
and
here
it's
not
just
doctors.
if
anyone
in
the
audience
today
learns
about
this
correlation
because
of
this
argument,
if
they're
listening
carefully,
and
then
they
go
to
their
doctor
and
ask
for
a
test,
they
will,
number
one,
be
inducing
infringement;
number
two,
if
they
look
at
the
test
result,
now
being
armed
with
what
we
have
given
them,
which
is
the
scientific
knowledge
that
the
correlation
exists,
they
will
infringe.
and
there
was
testimony
in
trial
to
that
effect.
so
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
get
into
the
inquiry.
and
i
don't
think
the
patent
office
really
wants
to
get
into
that
inquiry
either,
to
have
to
look
at
each
patent
application
to
determine
not
just
based
on
what's
in
it
whether
it's
valid
but
whether
there
are
other
uses
not
even
invented
yet
that
might
not
be
covered.
that's
not,
i
submit,
what
the
patent
office
would
like
to
do.
if
i
might
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
hopefully
i
won't,
i
won't
have
to
use
all
that.
just
a
few
points,
your
honors.
there
was
a
suggestion
made
that
it
matters
what
purpose
these
tests
were
undertaken
for.
that
is
not
true.
we
had
argued
extensively
that
it
did
matter,
that
in
fact
the
doctors
were
using
this
for
not
detecting
vitamin
deficiencies
but
for
detecting
heart
disease.
that
was
not...
we
were
not
successful
on
that.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
any
doctor
on
pain
of
malpractice
will
necessarily
perform
the
correlating
every
time
that
doctor
looks
at
a
test
result.
so
it
doesn't
matter
why
the
doctor
does
that.
second,
morse
was
clearly
a
case
decided
under
what
is
now
section
112.
i
think
mr.
hungar
admitted
that.
the
language
of
the
case
makes
that
clear.
it
quotes
the
relevant
statute,
and
all
of
this
is
in
our
reply
brief,
and
it
concludes
that
the
patent
in
that
case
was
overbroad
because
it
didn't,
it
contravened
what
is
now
section
112
and
that
is
how
we
argued--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--they
were.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no,
i
don't.
he
is
correct
on
that.
but
look
at
the
case
and
how
it
was
decided.
it
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
what
is
now
section
112.
we
have
cited
numerous
cases
in
the
lower
courts
that
have
interpreted
it
that
way.
and
i
believe
mr.
hungar
admitted
that
too.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i
think
the
explanation
is
that
we
cited
all
of
the
cases...
for
example,
mackay
radio
is
a
case
we
cited
that
doesn't
itself
cite
101.
the
court
itself
never
cited
101
in
these
cases
until
1972.
it
was
a
judicially
created
exception
for
laws
of
nature
and
natural
phenomena.
and
of
course
to
the
extent
it
is
applicable
here,
it
is
applicable
either
on
its
own,
but
also
in
connection
with
and
as
a
natural
predicate
to
the
112
inquiry.
and
there
i
think
the
analogy
to
morse
is
quite
striking.
and
what...
in
morse,
the
court
said
that
he
could
not
monopolize
all
devices
and
processes
used
to
transmit
the
characters
at
a
distance
through
the
natural
phenomenon
of
electromagnetism.
here
what
these
patent
cases
are
seeking
to
do
is
to
monopolize
all
homocysteine
tests
that
are
used
to,
as
they
say,
detect
vitamin
deficiencies
through
the
natural
correlation
that
they
recite.
morse
couldn't
do
that
because
it
wasn't
limited
to
the
one
device
that
he
actually
invented.
here
they
cannot
do
it
because
it's
not
limited
to
the
one
homocysteine
assay
that
they
in
fact
invented,
that
we
use
and
that
we
pay
royalties
on
every
time
we
use.
finally,
i
think
that
the
primary
gatekeepers
here
on
these
kinds
of
things
is
the
patent
&
trademark
office.
i
think
they're
trying
their
best,
but
what
i
heard
from
their
representative
today
is
that
they're
not
prepared
to
do
anything
about
these
kinds
of
patents
unless
this
court
gives
them
further
guidance.
we
are
only
asking
that
the
court
give
them
further
guidance
on
this
patent
and
to
say
that
a
patent
that
claims
nothing
more
than
a
natural
correlation
preceded
by
the
inherent
and
generic
step
of
measuring
the
input
for
that
correlation
is
invalid
and
the
judgment
that
is
based
upon
it
should
also
be
reversed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
