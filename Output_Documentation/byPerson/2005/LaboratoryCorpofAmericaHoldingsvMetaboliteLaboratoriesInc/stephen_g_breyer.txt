justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
you
told
the...
you
said,
judge,
if
you
in
fact
hold
that
this
claim
13
satisfies
section
112
and
is
sufficiently
precise
and
specific
and
concise,
if
you
hold
that,
then
the
claim
would
violate
morse?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
argued
that
specifically?
and
so
your
problem...
i
guess
that
you
said
that.
i
mean,
you
quote
it
in
your
supplementary
brief
on
page
6.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
the
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
it
said.
it
didn't
say
morse.
it
said
diehr.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
dier
incorporates
morse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
complaint
about
the
paragraph
on
17a
is
that
it
did
not
deal
with
that
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
imagine
they'll
say
that
simply
mentioning
it
in
an
oral
argument
is
not
enough
to
get
us
to
think
seriously
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
understand
the
definiteness
doctrine.
i
mean,
all
these
things
in
1854
i
guess
weren't
so
clear.
but
i
think
the
precise
claim
in
samuel
morse's
case
was
the
use
of
the
motive
power
of
the
electric
current
for
making
or
printing
intelligible
characters.
that
sounds
absolutely
definite.
anyone
can
understand
it.
i
thought
the
problem
there
was
that
although
anyone
can
understand
it,
you
can't
claim
something
as
broad
as
that.
you
must
intend
to
claim
something
narrower.
and
insofar
as
it's
narrower,
it
isn't
precise.
so
insofar
as
it's
broad,
it's
too
broad,
but
definite.
and
insofar
as
it's
narrow,
it's
not
there,
but
indefinite.
okay?
precisely
the
claim
that
they
raised
before
the
federal
circuit
and
precisely
the
claim...
with
appropriate
citations,
and
precisely
the
claim
in
respect
to
which
the
federal
circuit
said
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.
and
we
here
apply
the
correlation
to
any
homocysteine
test,
anyone
here,
anyone
in
the
future,
anyone
that
any
mind
might
impend.
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
apply
electricity
to
all
methods
of
putting
down
letters
with
electricity.
i
apply
the
correlation
to
all
methods
of
creating
a
homocysteine
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
going
beyond
it.
i
just
thought
that
line
between
definiteness
and
101,
112,
101
is
not
quite
so
clear
as
i
would
have
thought,
because
it
sounds
to
me
relying
on
the
1854
case
of
samuel
f.
b.
morse,
they're
making
the
same
kind
of
argument
and,
indeed,
you
translated
morse
as
a
definiteness
112
argument,
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that's
the
kind
of
argument
they're
making.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
what
do
you
say
in
response
to
my
question
to
the
solicitor
general?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
they
thought
it
was
obvious,
that
they
thought
that
obviously
the
problem
here
with
this
particular
claim
is
that
it
doesn't
say
specifically
which
tests
this
principle
is
meant
to
apply
to.
so
it
isn't
definite
enough.
it
never
occurred
to
anyone
that
if
you
tried
to
apply
it
to
every
test,
it
was
somehow
a
valid
patent,
so
they
made
it
in
the
definitive
context.
because
for
154
years,
it's
been
clear
that
you
can't
take
a
principle
of
nature
like
electricity
and
simply
make
a
claim
for
all
uses
of
electricity
to
create
letters.
that's
their
analogy.
and
they
thought
by
referring
to
the
cases
and
by
referring
to
the
failure
to
point
out
definitely
what
the
tests
were
this
applied
to,
it
violated
112
because
otherwise,
it
wouldn't
be
a
valid
patent,
which
everyone
in
the
patent
field
would
know.
that's
at
least,
i
think,
what
they're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
onto
something,
to
me,
that
is
absolutely
fundamental.
you
have
millions
of
doctors
and
scientists
and
computer
people
who
are
working
extremely
hard
to
think
of
useful
ideas
and
if
you
don't
give
them
an
incentive,
they
may
think
of
less.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they're
all
useful.
at
the
same
time,
if
you
patent
all
of
their
ideas,
including
very
useful
mini
micro
principle
ideas,
you
will
establish
monopolies
throughout
this
country
beyond
belief
and
it
will
be
difficult
for
people,
without
paying
vast
amounts
of
money,
to
use
their
useful
ideas.
so
what
principle
do
we
use
to
separate
the
scientific
idea
which
can't
be
patented
from
the
process
which
can
be?
i
thought
that
the
claim
was
settled
by
morse,
flook
and
diehr.
now
would
it
make
sense...
you
can
answer
any
part
of
this
question
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
make
sense
to
send
this
back
and
say,
look,
at
least
address
their
argument?
you
can
answer
any
part
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
does
that
fall
within
it?
i
mean,
i
can't
resist
pointing,
as
one
of
these
briefs
did,
the
phrase
that
anything
under
the
sun
that
is
made
by
man
comes
from
a
committee
report
that
said
something
different.
it
said
a
person
may
have
invented
a
machine
or
a
manufacture,
which
may
include
anything
under
the
sun
that
is
made
by
man.
so
referring
to
that
doesn't
help
solve
the
problem
where
we're
not
talking
about
a
machine
or
a
manufacture.
rather
we
are
talking
about
what
has
to
be
done
in
order
to
make
an
abstract
idea
fall
within
the
patent
act.
now,
sometimes
you
can
make
that
happen
by
connecting
it
with
some
physical
things
in
the
world
and
sometimes
you
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
have
a
clear
statement
other
than
diehr,
flook,
morse,
which
draws
that
line
properly,
let
me
know.
