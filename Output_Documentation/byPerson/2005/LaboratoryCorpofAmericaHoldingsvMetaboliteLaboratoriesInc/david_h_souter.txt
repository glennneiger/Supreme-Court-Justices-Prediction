justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
arguing
now,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
reason
you
win
on
definiteness
is
that
it
sweeps
in
even
as
yet
uninvented
processes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
does
so
by
means,
in
effect,
of
erecting
this
umbrella
of
a
natural
fact
which
is
intended
to
cover
every
process
that
might
be
relevant
to
establishing
that
natural
fact.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
you're
saying
we
cannot...
no
court
can
decide
definiteness
in
this
situation
without
hitting
the
patentable
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
i
think
you've
hit
what
is
the
problem
for
us.
when
you
use
the
word
assay,
you
assume
that
that
is
excluding
certain
processes.
and
that's
not
clear
to
me.
would
you
explain
that
in
greater
detail?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
an
assay
was
in
effect
synonymous
with
any
process
that
gets
the
relevant
data
and
you're
using
it
in
a
more...
i
think,
in
answering
justice
breyer's
question,
you
were
using
it
in
a
narrower
sense.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
that
was
the
point
of
your
argument,
that
there
are
assays
and
then
there
are
other
methods.
did
i
misunderstand
you?
