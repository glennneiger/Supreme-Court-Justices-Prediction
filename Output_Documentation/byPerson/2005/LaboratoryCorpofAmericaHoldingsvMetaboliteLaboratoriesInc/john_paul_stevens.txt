justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
franklin,
whenever
you're
ready,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
this
patent,
you
really
mean
just
claim
13,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may,
mr.
franklin.
i
think
mr.
hungar
is
next.
mr.
estrada.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
too
hungry,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
hungar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
about
its
validity
under
101?
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me.
but
i
didn't
ask
you
what
you
said
in
your
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
patent...
talking
about
step
1,
you
can
use
any
assay
method
you
want.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
patented.
but
the
correlation,
step
2,
that
any
time
you
ask
a
doctor
to
tell
us
what
you
think
the
results
of
the
test
mean,
that
that's
an
infringement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
possible
that
that
can
be
patentable,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
just
go
to
the
doctor
and
ask
for
advice
and
he
says,
yes,
i've
looked
at
the
results;
you've
got
a
vitamin
b
deficiency
or
whatever
it
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he's
committed
infringement
under
this
patent
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
raise
the...
just
do
you
think
that
that
patent
is
valid?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
ask
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
all
that.
i'm
just
really
interested
in
your
view
of
the
patent.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there
is
a
101
problem
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
do
have
a
fairly
long
discussion
by
the
lower
court
on
the
infringement
issue.
in
order
to
find
infringement,
they
had
to
construe
correlation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
estrada,
it's
your
turn
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt.
as
i
understand
it,
the
alleged
infringers
don't
use
the
same
novel
process
that
you
use
in
your
assay,
in
other
words,
step
1.
they
do
not
use
the
step
1
in
claim
13,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
it's
not
abbott.
just
say
i
come
up
with
a
novel
method
that's
not
covered
by
the
patent
that
i
can
get
the
assay
results.
and
so
a
doctor
says,
would
you
test
the
blood
under
your
unpatented,
novel
method
and
tell
me
what
the
results
are?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
do
that
and
then
the
doctor
looks
at
it
and
says
i
think
you've
got
a
vitamin
b
deficiency,
has
he
infringed
your
patent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
ordered
for
the
purpose
of
letting
the
doctor
know
exactly
what
the
assay
would
be.
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
hasn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
a
doctor
asked
me
to
perform
under
my,
my
own
method,
step
1,
which
i
do
it
and
i
give
him
the
results
and
then
he
tells
the
patient,
i
think
you've
got
a
vitamin
b
deficiency,
in
that
case,
he
has
infringed,
if
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
agree
with
me,
do
you
not,
that
step
2
by
itself
would
not
be
patentable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point
is
that
even
though
step
2
is
performed
as
the
second
step
of
step
1
which
is
also
not
patentable,
you
get
together
for
the
patent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
case
be
different
if
they
quoted
section
101
in
their
appendix?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
wainwright
against
sykes
was
even
decided
before
aedpa
was
passed,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
franklin,
i
think
you
have
about
four
and
a
half
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
want
to
take
up
your
time
on
rebuttal
but
i
have
to
ask
you,
do
you
have
an
explanation
for
not
quoting
section
101
in
your
papers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
also
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
no.
04-607,
laboratory
corporation
of
america
versus
metabolite
laboratories,
inc.
the
petition
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
the
chief
justice
did
not
participate
in
the
case.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
souter
and
i
have
joined.
