mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
oh,
sorry.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
was
a
hard
fought
jury
trial
in
which
the
jury
rejected
everything
labcorp
had
to
sell.
that
judgment
should
be
affirmed
for
three
reasons.
the
first
is
labcorp
never
asked
the
trial
judge
or
the
federal
circuit
to
declare
this
patent
invalid
under
section
101,
which
is
an
affirmative
defense
they
had
to
plead
in
the
answer
and
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
second,
they're
simply
wrong
on
the
merits
of
the
101
case
under
this
court's
cases.
and
third,
you
can
search
their
brief
in
vain
for
a
workable
test
for
patentable
subject
matter
that
would
invalidate
this
patent
and
not
wreak
complete
havoc
to
the
patent
world
by
calling
into
question
numerous
diagnostic
tests
in
medicine
and
otherwise,
pharmaceuticals
and
other
inventions.
let
me
deal
briefly
with
the
waiver
question
because
we
don't
get
a
sur
reply
brief
and
there
is
a
lot
in
the
reply
brief
that
i
wish
i
could
deal
with
at
length.
but
i
think
i
will
say
that
it
is
a
collection
of
cropped
quotes
and
very
inventive
characterizations
of
the
record.
i
will
give
you
just
two
examples.
at
the
bottom
of
page
9,
they're
trying
to
get
out
of
their
unitherm
problem,
never
having
this
raised
in
the
answer
or
in
the
rule
50.
and
the
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
discusses
the
rule
50
and
states
or
at
least
suggests
that
this
argument
in
terms
was
raised
before
the
trial
court,
concluding
with
the
sentence,
"respondents
themselves
understood
labcorp
to
have
thereby
presented
subject
matter
patentability.
"
they
cite
to
our
brief
on
jmol.
i
have
that
here.
this
is
what
we
said.
"the
quick
answer
to
labcorp's
mental
steps
theme
is
that
labcorp
never
pled
it
in
the
defense.
"
"labcorp.
"
"pled
invalidity
on
the
basis
of
102,
103,
112
on
the
grounds
that
the
patent
was
anticipated,
obvious,
indefinite,
non
enabled
and
procured
by
inequitable
conduct.
"
"but
the
so
called
mental
steps
doctrine
goes
instead
to
the
question
whether
patent
covers
statutory
subject
matter.
"
"that
is
governed
exclusively
by
section
1,
101.
"
"labcorp
has
never
mentioned
that
section
and
has
never
pled
the
patent
is
invalid
for
covering
non
statutory
subject
matter
even,
in
its
present
jmol
motion.
"
footnote:
labcorp
failed
to
assert
invalidity
on
the
basis
of
non
statutory
subject
matter
in
any
of
its
five
answers
or
counterclaims
or
in
any
of
its
interrogatory
responses.
none
of
its
experts,
including
its
patent
law
expert,
made
any
such
assertion
in
any
reports
or
testimony.
that
gets
translated
in
the
reply
brief
as
we
understood
this
issue
was
in
front
of
the
courts.
now,
we
made
that
point
in
our
papers.
there
was
no
response
saying,
no,
wait,
district
judge,
this
isn't
the
case.
rule
on
section
101.
not
a
word.
we
had
the
same
exchange
in
the
federal
circuit
and,
once
again,
we
pointed
out
this
was
101,
had
been
waived
six
ways
from
sunday.
not
a
response
telling
the
federal
circuit,
this
isn't
the
case,
please
rule.
and
this
is
important
because
you're
being
asked
to
tell
trial
court
and
three
courts
of
appeals
judges
that
they
committed
reversible
error
for
failing
to
address
a
question
that
nobody
ever
asked
them.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
which
question,
justice
breyer?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think
it
is
wrong
in
the
facts
and
under
law.
if
it
was
obvious
all
along
this
is
an
affirmative
defense
under
section
282
of
the
patent
code,
that
must
be
pleaded.
one
certainly
can't
be
excused
for
failing
to
plead
something
that,
dare
i
say,
is
obvious.
but
let's
deal
with
the
morse
case.
mr.
franklin
said
it's
the
same
statute
at
the
time.
actually,
that
is
not
so.
at
the
time
morse
was
decided,
section
112
and
101
were
both
together
in
section
6
of
the
1836
patent
act.
in
1870,
congress
broke
that
off.
that's
important
because
in
diehr,
this
court
considered
a
similar
issue
with
respect
to
the
novelty
requirement
and
concluded
that
once
congress
consciously
wrote
the
novelty
requirement
out
of
section
101,
it
was
inappropriate
to
inject,
you
know,
the
novelty
considerations
into
section
101.
the
second
answer
to
the
morse
question,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
test
for
definiteness
is
not
is
this
definite
in
the
abstract,
but
is
it
really
too
broad
in
relation
to
the
inventive
contribution
as
disclosed
in
the
specifications.
and
the
contrast
here
that
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
is
between
morse
in
1854
and
alexander
graham
bell,
claim
5
of
that
patent.
just
to
set
it
up,
in
the
morse
case,
claim
8,
it
had
been
known
for
many
years
that
it
was
possible
to
transmit
using
the
electromagnetic
current
but
nobody
knew
how.
and
in
fact,
this
court's
ruling
on
page
107
says
this
was
known
by
men
of
science
everywhere.
and
the
problem
was
that
morse
discovered
one
particular
way
to
transmit
characters
at
a
distance
and
tried
to
patent
everything
that
everybody
might
ever
discover
using
whatever
means
to
print
at
a
distance.
alexander
graham
bell
is
a
good
contrast.
claim
5.
it
was
also
known
that
you
could
use
the
electronic
current
to
transmit
voice.
people
had
tried
and
tried
and
tried
and,
in
fact,
there
was
somebody
in
germany
who
successfully
transmitted
music
but
no
words.
this
is
all
in...
in
the
court's
opinion.
now,
graham
bell
discovered
that
the
key
was
to
use
continuous
undulations
in
current.
continuous
undulations,
not
discontinuous
undulations.
and
had
a
patent
claim,
claim
5,
which
was
very
broad.
all
users
of
continuous
undulations
to
transmit
voice
or
sound.
the
court
said
that's
absolutely
right,
because
he
was
not
trying
to
claim
beyond
his
inventive
contribution
to
the
art.
now,
drs.
stabler
and
allen
in
this
case
discovered
something
very
important
which
is
all
of
the
medical
tests
that
existed
in
the
art
as
late
as
the
1880s...
the
1980s
were
wrong.
people
were
horribly
misdiagnosed.
and
there
was
a
test
that
existed
but
nobody
used.
this
is
what
the
record
was.
the
test
for
existing
homocysteine
was
almost
never
used,
as
dr.
allen
testified
to
this.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record.
this
is
why
we
have
jury
trials.
and
what
happened
was
this
test
was
solely
for
attempting
to
diagnose
inherited
enzyme
defects.
this
is
rare.
nobody
used
it.
there
was
not
a
market
for
it.
as
a
result
of
the
discovery,
the
medical
community
came
around
and
concluded
that
everything
they
were
doing
was
wrong
and
the
new
test
combining
the
knowledge
that
it
was
possible
to
assay
for
homocysteine...
and
by
the
way,
the
assaying
means
only
measuring...
total
homocysteine
with
the
discovery
of
the
correlation
could
be
put
together,
as
diehr
allows,
to
come
up
with
a
better
diagnostic
test.
and
at
the
time,
obviously,
and
this
is,
again,
in
the
trial
testimony,
no
market
for
this.
nobody
wanted
to
do
it.
everybody
was
just
delighted
with
the
existing
tests.
and
so
dr.
allen
and
dr.
stabler
had
to
set
up
their
own
lab
to
do
it.
it
was
after
the
medical
community
came
around
that
all
of
the
lab
companies
became
interested
in
doing
this
commercially.
and
i
go
into
this
level
of
detail
because
i
think
it
is
in
part
needed
to
answer
the
point
made
by
the
solicitor
general.
in
a
world
in
which
there
was
no
commercial
use
for
the
existing
prior
art
because
it
was
used
rarely,
and
a
market
develops
solely
as
a
result
of
people
using
the
test
to
practice
the
invention,
i
think
it's
analytically
incorrect
to
say
that
we're
trying
to
monopolize
the
existing
prior
art.
what
has
happened
is
commercial
laboratory
companies
like
labcorp
are
selling
the
test
to
practice
our
invention.
it
was
open
to
them
to
say--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--our...
yes
and
no.
i
think
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
question,
justice
stevens,
because
it
is
true
that
the
abbott
method--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--all
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
if
the
test
was
not
ordered
for
the
purpose
of
diagnosing--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
unless--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--there
was
a
purpose
for
diagnosing
the
deficiency,
i
would
say
no.
and
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
engaging
what
our
arguments
have
been
all
along,
we
made
clear
in
our
brief,
and
nobody
ever
responded,
at
page
38,
that
claim
13
is
only
infringed
when
the
assaying
and
the
correlating
steps
are
both
performed
sequentially
for
the
purpose
of
diagnosing
vitamin
b
deficiency.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
if
he
did
it
for
the
purposes
of
trying
to
determine
whether
you
had
a
vitamin
deficiency.
now,
if
he
did
it
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
determine,
as
in
the
prior
art,
whether
you
had
an
inherited
enzyme
condition,
that
would
not
be
infringing.
and
this
point
was
addressed,
obviously
somewhat
indirectly
because
it
was
never
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
by
the
federal
circuit
at
page
9
a
and
10
a
where
the
federal
circuit
explained
the
correlating
step
was
included
as
a
limit
for
the
intended
use
of
the
test
as
a
means
to
distinguish
the
intended
use
for
this
test
from
the
prior
art.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
correct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
all
right.
let
me--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
three
answers.
number
one,
under
the
patent
laws,
everybody...
anybody
who
makes,
uses
or
sells
the
invention
is
potentially
liable
as
an
infringer.
number
two,
congress
knows
this
and
it
knows
that
the
people
who
might
be
liable
as
infringers
are
doctors.
it
passed
in
1996
section
287
c
of
the
patent
law
that
gives
doctors
a
defense
to
infringement
for
certain
things
they
do
in
their
offices,
not
this
one.
so
congress
is
perfectly
aware
of
all
of
the
policy
issues
being
raised
and
has
chosen
to
give
an
answer
only
so
far.
the
third
is
it
is
a
fundamental
misconception
to
treat
the
case
as
though,
even
if
the
section
101
issue
is
in
front
of
the
court...
and
it
isn't...
whether
the
issue
is
whether
section
101
means
that
something
is
actually
patentable
as
opposed
to
what
diehr
said,
which
is,
is
it
possibly
patentable.
this
is
subject
matter
patentability.
is
the
mouth
of
the
funnel,
not
the
end
of
the
funnel,
and
all
of
the
outlandish
hypotheticals
that
we
have
to
deal
about
how
this
could
be
patented
don't
really
deal
with
the
reality
of
the
patent
code,
which
is
this
is
the
intake
funnel.
we
have
doctrines
of
obviousness,
anticipation,
112,
many
other
things,
all
of
which
were
raised
at
trial
and
the
jury
rejected
in
this
case.
but
the
reason
why
there
may
be
some
superficial
appeal
to
the
outlandish
hypotheticals,
justice
breyer,
is
because
there
is
an
effort
to
confuse
the
issue
that
they're
trying
to
smuggle
belatedly
into
the
case,
101,
as
though
it
dealt
with
whether
something
is
actually
patentable
as
opposed
to
potentially
patentable.
and
on
the
latter
question,
whether
something
is
potentially
patentable,
we
have
the
extremely
broad
language
of
section
101
coupled
by
this
court's
cases,
in
chakrabarty
and
diehr,
which
said
that
what
congress
intended
is
for
anything
under
the
sun
made
by
man
to
be
potentially
patentable.
and
if
there
is
some
more
precise
policy
issue
why
a
particular
invention
ought
not
to
be
patentable,
it
is
found
in
section
102,
103,
112,
other
parts
of
the
patent
code,
on
which
they
lost
in
front
of
the
jury.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
the...
we
don't
contend
that
the
second
step
of
the
correlation
is
independently
patentable
even
though
the
argument
is
framed
as
a...
argument.
what
we
contend
is
patentable
and
what's
allowed
by
diehr
is
the
inventive
spark
of
putting
together
the
discovery
of
the
correlation
with
a
way
found
elsewhere
to
measure
these
important
bodily
chemicals
to
produce
a
diagnostic
test.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
that's
unfair
to
the
federal
circuit
on
two
points.
number
one,
it
was
very
clear
to
the
federal
circuit,
and
in
fact
i
think
they
said
that,
i
can't
put
my
hand
on
the
page,
where
they
said,
there
is
no
issue
here
about
step
number
one.
all
that
people
are
fighting
about
is
the
correlating
step
and
what
it
means.
and
the
problem
that
labcorp
had
in
the
federal
circuit
with
respect
to
the
correlating
step,
which
is
a
question
they
tried
to
bring
up
and
was
cert
denied,
is
that
they
proposed
in
the
district
court
the
definition
that
was
used
by
the
federal
circuit,
which
is
a
mutual
or
reciprocal
relationship
between
an
elevated
level
and
the
vitamin.
and
so
having
proposed
that,
it
actually
makes
sense
as
a
diagnostic
test,
as
the
federal
circuit
pointed
out
with
the
example
of
the
pregnancy
test.
now,
justice
scalia,
you
asked
a
question
earlier--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
it
is
true
but
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
being
aware
of
a
natural
phenomenon
or
of
a
correlation
leads
you
inevitably
to
an
inventive
diagnostic
test.
there
is
a
correlation
between
being
told
and
between
height
and
weight.
if
i
tell
you
that
somebody's
coming
to
visit
you
who
is
250
pounds,
that
person
is
probably
not
a
five
year
old.
but
that
gets
me
nowhere
in
terms
of
turning
that
into
useful
knowledge
that
would
be
patentable.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
do
agree
with
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
true.
and
if
you
look
at
the
diehr
case,
it's
a
perfect
example
because
diehr
had
more
steps
but
it
was
absolutely
true
in
diehr
that
every
single
step,
including
the
mathematical
equation,
was
part
of
the
prior
art.
and
this
court
said
that's
potentially
patentable
because
you
have
found
a
way
to
put
all
these
disparate
things
together
in
a
way
that
makes
them
potentially
useful.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
but
justice
breyer--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
the
telephone
cases,
bell
and
diehr,
are
cases
that
absolutely
show
that
under
this
court's
cases,
this
is
patentable
subject
matter.
again,
we're
talking
about
the
mouth
of
the
funnel,
not
the
end
of
the
funnel.
but
let
me
point
something
else,
justice
breyer,
which
is
it
came
from
a
committee
report
that
has
already
been
incorporated
in
this
court's
cases
in
chakrabarty
and
in
diehr
as
exemplary
of
congress'
determination
to
have
the
mouth
of
the
funnel
be
very
wide.
and
if
there
are
problems
with
something
being
ultimately
patentable,
they
are
because
there
is
some
other
requirement
of
the
patent
law
that...
that...
that
should
be
looked
at.
one
of
the
other
points
on
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked,
because
i
think
it
is
important
on
whether
this
question
is
before
the
court,
is
that
the
rules
of
this
court,
rule
14-1-f
mandated
that
the
petition
shall
contain,
quote,
the
status
involved
in
the
case
set
out
verbatim.
and
you
can
pick
up
the
cert
petition
and
indeed
there
is
an
appendix
which
is
at
the
very
last
page
of
the
petition,
and
you
can
look
at
it
and
it
says,
pertinent
statutory
provisions.
there
are
two
statutes,
section
112
and
section
271.
you
can
pick
up
their
blue
brief
and
do
the
same
with
the
back
flap,
and
we
would
have
the
fishes
and
the
loaves.
now
they
have
three
statutes,
101,
112
and
271.
there
is
no
way
to
construe
their
question
3
as
having
been
intended
all
along
to
encompass
a
very
separate
affirmative
defense
that
they
never
put
in
front
of
the
trial
court
or
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
different,
justice
stevens,
because
then
their
argument
that
this
was
encompassed
within
one
of
the
questions
in
the
petition
might
have
some
surface
plausibility.
but
it
doesn't.
let
me
just
go
back
and
link
that
point
with
another
aspect
of
our
legal
system,
which
is
you
see
cases
of
forfeiture
and
waiver
all
the
time.
this
term
in
unitherm
and
in
arbaugh,
you
have
already
said
twice
that
parties
should
be
held
responsible
for
their
procedural
defaults.
you
do
that
in
other
areas
of
the
law.
and
the
one
that
came
to
mind,
to
my
mind
as
i
was
thinking
about
this
case,
justice
stevens,
is
going
all
the
way
back
to
wainwright
versus
sykes,
because
you
have
cases
every
year
involving
habeas
corpus,
where
wainwright
versus
sykes
says
we
have
to
be
careful
about
sandbagging,
and
we're
going
to
presume
that
an
indigent
defendant
on
trial
for
his
life
in
a
rural
county
someplace
with
a
lawyer
two
years
out
of
law
school,
who
can't
find
the
courthouse,
consciously
chose
to
save
the
federal
claims
so
that
he
could
assert
later,
have
it
in
his
back
pocket:
we're
going
to
have
a
rule
of
forfeiture
for
sandbagging.
empirically,
one
may
well
wonder
whether
that
is
empirically
likely
to
be
true
in
a
great
number
of
cases.
but
we
don't
have
to
wonder
in
this
case
because
every
well
advised
corporate
defendant,
if
i
am
their
lawyer,
i
will
advise
them
to
hold
this
in
the
back
pocket
and
to
have
a
second
trip
to
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
because
in
the
rules
in
affirmative
defense,
rule
8
says
you
have
to
plead
it
and
the
statute
says
you
have
to
prove
it.
and
it
went
all
the
way
up
the
ladder.
and
if
you
tell
them
that
they
get
to
start
all
over
again,
what
you
will
have
is
every
well
advised
corporate
defendant
will
be
advised
by
counsel,
like
me
and
by
mr.
franklin,
that
the
way
to
do
is
to
tire
the
inventor
out,
have
a
trial
and
then
we
can
start
all
over
again.
and
that's
no
way
to
run
a
legal
system,
especially
when
they're
coming
with
the
most
important
questions
of
patent
law
to
this
court
with
incredibly
far
reaching
implications
and
the
best
that
they
can
say
to
the
court
about
why
you
shouldn't
worry
about
the
consequences
is,
as
they
say
in
the
closing
pages
of
the
reply
brief,
rule
for
us
and
every
other
case
will
have
to
be
considered
on
its
own
merits.
which
i
guess
is
true
as
far
as
it
goes
but
it's
about
as
helpful
as
telling
the
patent
office
and
the
lower
courts
that
life
is
a
fountain.
and
you
know,
this
court
does
not
sit
to
issue--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
didn't
say
it
wasn't.
i
just
said
that
the
expression
of
that
thought
is
not
helpful.
and
insofar
as
this
court
sits
to
advise
the
lower
courts
and
the
government
and
the
patents
office
and
the
investing
community
who
could
swing
billions
of
dollars
on
the
basis
of
an
issue
that
was
never
litigated
in
the
lower
courts,
i
frankly
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
it
would
be
irresponsible
for
the
court
to
reach
out
and
deal
with
a
question
for
which
there
was
never
an
adequate
factual
predicate.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
exactly.
and
congress
actually
implemented
that
in
aedpa.
and
so
my
basic
point,
justice
stevens,
is
if
that
the
legal
system
takes
the
procedural
regularity
of
our
courts
seriously
enough
to
enforce
them
in
what
would
seem
to
some
people
to
be
pretty
compelling
circumstances
of
life
and
death,
there
is
little
claim
on
the
legal
system
for
a
well
heeled
corporate
defendant
who
has
been
adjudged
to
be
a
willful
infringer
by
a
jury
to
come
to
this
court
and
asked
to
be
put
in
the
starting
gate
again.
there
is
no
way
that...
again,
that
is
no
way
to
deal
with
the
legal
system.
i
have
nothing
further,
justice
stevens.
