justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
the
issue
there
what
is
patentable?
i
mean
this
case
in
the
district
court
was
under
this
definiteness
idea,
112.
101
deals
with
what's
patentable.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you,
this
case
was
presented
as
a
definiteness
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
abbott
test...
that's
patented
and
you're
paying
royalties
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
but
you
don't
think
the
district
court
got
it
right,
either.
you
said
the
district
court
required
something
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
something
more
and
why
wasn't
that
adequate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
the
district
court
did
is
it
got,
it
tried
this
case
and
it
got
a
rather
large
jury
verdict.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
don't
understand
how
you're
setting
off
the
district
court
from
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
court
of
appeals,
whatever
it
said,
it
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
