mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
claim
13
satisfies
the
written
description,
enablement
and
definiteness
requirements
of
section
112
of
the
patent
act.
the
patent
specification
sets
forth
the
scope
and
nature
of
the
claimed
invention
in
terms
readily
understandable
by
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
and
it
enables
such
persons
to
practice
the
claimed
invention.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
that
obviously
assumes
the
conclusion,
your
honor.
but
with
respect
to
the
definiteness
requirement,
the
challenge
seems
to
be
that
because
the
first
step
of
claim
13
is
not
limited
to
a
particular
type
of
assay
but
instead
claims
all
assays,
that
that
somehow
renders
it
indefinite,
and
that
argument
is
simply
incorrect
as
this
court
has
recognized
for
over
a
hundred
years.
in
the
cochrane
against
deener
case,
for
example,
the
court
addressed
that
question
where
a
process
claim
was
not
limited
to
a
particular
method
of
performing
a
particular
step
of
the
process,
and
the
court
said,
"a
process
may
be
patentable
irrespective
of
the
particular
form
of
the
instrumentalities
used.
"
and
the
court
reiterated
that
principle
in
the
diehr
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it
can
be.
it
might
or
might
not
be
depending
on
the
circumstances.
the
morse
case
is
an
example
where
it
was
both
indefinite
and
invalid
because
trying
to
claim
a
principle
of
nature,
in
effect.
but
by
the
same
token
you
can
easily
have,
and
in
fact
you
have
here,
a
claim
where
it's
definite
in
that
persons
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
understand
the
scope
of
the
claims.
they
know
what
is
and
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
patent,
which
is,
in
this
case,
a
question
entirely
separate
from
the
question
whether,
as
construed
by
the
court
and
as
understood
by
the
person
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art,
it's
valid,
under
section
101,
that
is,
under
the
scope
of
patentable
subject
matter.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief,
we
don't
think
that
that
question
is
properly
before
the
court
but
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor.
but
that
if
the
court
were
to
reach
that
question,
we
think
that
while
it's
unclear
because
the
issue
wasn't
litigated,
there
appears
to
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
invalidity
under
benson,
this
court's
decision
in
benson,
because,
given
what
we
currently
know,
it
appears
that
the
claim
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
preempts
all
substantial
practical
applications
of
the
correlation.
but
because
that
issue
wasn't
litigated
below,
if
the
court
were
to
reach
it,
it
should
remand--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
how
the
court
of
appeals
construed
it,
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
is
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
again,
your
honor,
we--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--as
we
indicated--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
raises
a
potentially
serious
pre
emption
problem
and
it
also
raises
the
anticipation
problem,
that
is,
the
section
102
argument
which
is
not
before
the
court
but
if
it
were
litigated--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
we
think
it
has
validity
problems
under
section
102
and
also
under
the
pre
emption,...
potentially
under
the
pre
emption
doctrine.
we
haven't
addressed
the
other
issues
that
petitioner
seeks
to
put
before
the
court
involving
diehr
and
flook,
both
because...
well,
actually
for
four
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
wasn't
pressed
or
passed
upon
below,
it
wasn't...
it's
not
fairly
included
within
the
question
presented,
which
construed
at
its
most
broad,
broadly,
includes
only
the
monopolization
issue--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor.
and
as
i've
said,
we've
identified
two
areas
in
which
we
think
there
are
potentially
problems
if
they
were
in
front
of
the
court.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
preemption
issue
is
a
101
problem,
your
honor.
we
haven't
addressed...
as
i
said,
we
have
not
taken
a
position
on
the
broader
section
101
issues
and
we
would
urge
the
court
not
to
do
so
as
well,
in
a
case
in
which
it
wasn't
presented
below,
the
court
doesn't
have
the
benefit
of
the
lower
court's
assessment
of
that
question.
and
given
that
that
question
implicates
substantial
reliance
interests
and--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
the
court
didn't
grant
certiorari
on
that
question.
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
i
may
have
misspoken
before
but
i
think
it's
probably
most
accurate
to
read
the
morse
case
as
dealing
with
a
written
specification
problem,
that
is,
the
specification
in
claim
8,
the
one
your
honor
is
referring
to,
didn't
tell
anything
about
the
method
by
which
the
principle
of
nature,
electromagnetism,
would
be
used.
all
it
did
is
describe
a
result,
and
it
purported
to
claim
any,
any
method
involving
any
number
of
steps
that
any
inventor
might
ever
invent
in
the
future,
even
if
those
steps
had
nothing
to
do
with...
if
there
was
not
a
single
overlapping
step
between
that
new
process
and
morse's
process.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
the
difference
is
between
claiming
a...
claiming
all
methods
of
achieving
a
particular
result
and
claiming
one
process
for
achieving
that
particular
result
and
then
as
one
claiming
any
means
of
doing
one
particular
step.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
again,
your
honor,
if
it
is
true
that
all
methods
of
employing
the
assay...
excuse
me,
all
methods
of
employing
the
correlation
are
preempted
by
this
patent
claim,
then
it
would
be
invalid
under
section
101.
but
to
the
extent
the
argument
is
an
attempt
to
go
beyond
that
issue,
we
submit
morse
doesn't
support
it
and
indeed
this
court's
decision's
in--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
is
more
properly
understood
as
a
specification
problem
because,
as
you
say,
anyone
can
understand
the
scope
of
that
claim.
it's
just
that
it
was
not
sufficiently
described
because
he
was
purporting
to
claim
any
process
even
if
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
process
he
had
invented,
and
that's
not
what's
happening
here.
they
claim
a
particular
step,
that
is,
do
an
assay,
as
opposed
to
some
other
method,
and
they
claim
any
method
of
doing
that
assay
within
step
1
of
the
overall
claim
but
they
aren't
saying...
first
sense
of
the
analogy
would
be
if
they
had
claimed
we've
just
devised
one
particular
method
of
determining
whether
someone
has
a
vitamin
deficiency
and
we
therefore
claim
all
other
methods
of
determining
whether
someone
has
a
vitamin
deficiency.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
again,
we
don't
know--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i
think
that,
as
understood
by
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art,
we...
it
may
be.
we
don't
know
because
the
issue
wasn't
litigated.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
no.
certainly
it's
conceivable
that
there
are
other
methods
and
indeed
the
patent
claim...
the
patent
specification
refers
to...
or
suggests
the
possibility
of
assaying
tissue
as
opposed
to
fluid.
the
claim
is
limited
to
fluid.
i
thank
the
court.
