the
district
court
heard
that,
though,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
didn't
believe
it.
right?
and
did
not
believe
it.
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
blood
was...
was
not
a
result
of
the
spill.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
is
that
a
conclusion
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
what
part
it
put
it
in.
the
district
court
did
not
believe
that
the
blood
on
the
trousers
was
a
consequence
of
the
spill
and
that...
and
that,
therefore,
blood
was
identified
on
the
inside
of
his
trousers
that
was
the
blood
of
the
victim.
that's
what
the
district
court
believed,
having
heard
the
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
that
point...
on
that
one
point,
do
you
contend
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
that
one
point
of
the
blood,
of
whether,
indeed,
his
blood
was
on...
or
the
victim's
blood
was
on
the
inside
of
his
trousers?
on
that
one
point,
do
you
claim
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your...
what's
your
second
point?
because
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
basis
solely
of
the
testimony
of...
of
this
expert.
justice
antonin
scalia
including
the
contrary
testimony
that
said
if
it
had
been
the
result
of
a
spill,
it
would
not
have
been
splattered
all
over,
as
it
was
here.
some
of
it
wouldn't
have
been
on
the
inside
of
the
trousers.
some
of
it
wouldn't
have
been
mixed
with
mud.
despite
all
of
that,
you...
you
can
say
that
the
district
court's
finding,
which
i
consider
a
finding
of
fact,
was
clearly
erroneous.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i...
i
agree
that
all
of
this
stuff
would...
would
have
made
a
better
case
for
the
defendant
here.
but
once
the
case
has
been
tried
and
both
sides
have
put
on
all
the
evidence
they
have,
we
have
a...
a
much
different
test,
and...
and
that
is
whether
any
reasonable
juror
could
have
found
him
guilty.
that's
a
very
heavy
burden,
whether
any
reasonable
jury
could
have
found
guilt.
i
agree
it
would
have
been
a
much
closer
case,
but...
but
the
burden
you...
you
have
before
us
here
is
to
establish
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
possibly
have
found
him
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
on...
just
on
the
blood
thing
alone,
i...
i
find
that
a
hard
burden
to
bear.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
also
contained
the
testimony
of
an
expert
who
said
that
if
the
tube
spilled
in
that
way,
it
would
not
have
created
the
kind
of
spatterings
that...
that
were
incriminating
in
this
case.
even
if
there
was
some
spill,
it
would
not
have
produced
the
kind
of
spattering.
so,
you
know,
i
call
that
a
draw.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
would
be
an
important
point
if,
in
fact,
it
conclusively
established
that
the
blood
was
not
the
blood
of
the
victim,
but
i
don't
think
it
does
conclusively
establish
that,
and
if
it
doesn't,
the...
the
less
than
perfect
performance
of
counsel
is...
is
no
basis
for
setting
aside
the
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and...
and
the
point
of
controversy
is
whether
a
spill
of...
of
the...
of
the
blood
in...
in
the
course
of
transport
could
have
produced
this...
this
kind
of...
of
spattering,
including
a
spattering
on
the
inside
of...
of
the
trousers
near
the
button.
it...
it
seems
to
me
unlikely,
and...
and
i
am
unable
to
say
that
no
reasonable
jury...
juror
could
not
think
it
unlikely.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
much
more
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
surely
he's
supposed
to
make
factual
determinations.
we...
i...
i
don't
want
to
make
factual
determinations
on
all
these
questions.
that's...
that's
not
our
system
of
law.
those
factual
determinations
are
made
by
the
trial
judge.
and
here,
i
agree
with
you
that
we
don't
have
to
accept
his
judgment
as
to
what
a
reasonable
juror
would
have
done,
but
i
do
think
that
we
have
to
accept
his
factual
findings
as
accurate
unless
they're
clearly
erroneous.
and
here,
he
made
the
factual
finding
that
that
blood
was
there
before
the
transport.
and
i...
i
think
i'm
bound
by
that
unless
you
can
show
that
it
is
clearly
erroneous,
which
i
don't
think
you
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
the...
the
injuries
on
the
body
are
simply
not
consonant
with...
with
that
manner
of
her...
of
her
death.
a
police
officer
testified
not
only
to
a
head
injury,
but
to
blood
coming
out
of
the
nose
and
ears,
scratches
and
bruises
on
her
throat
and
legs,
scratches
on
her
face.
that
simply
is
not
consonant
with
one
whack
on
the
head.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
schlup
shouldn't...
shouldn't
have
expressed
it
that
way
then.
schlup
must
have...
must
have
made
a
big
mistake
when
it
said
no
reasonable
juror
could.
it
should
have
expressed
it
differently
and
said
a
reasonable
juror
would
not...
would
not
have
found,
but
they
didn't
say
that.
it
said
no
reasonable
juror.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
more
precisely,
what
would
all
reasonable
jurors
have
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
reasonable
jurors.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
agent
bigbee.
i'm
getting
confused.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
district
court
heard
all
of
this,
didn't
it,
all
this
evidence,
and...
and
didn't
the
district
court
make
a
factual
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we...
we
can
call
in
these
witnesses
ourselves,
i
suppose,
and
hear
them
all
again,
but
we
usually
accept
the
factual
findings
of
the
trier
of
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
smith,
could...
could
you
go
on
to
some
of
the
other
elements
that
are
contested
here?
in
particular,
i'm
interested
in...
in
mr.
muncey's
confession.
what...
what
do
you...
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
breyer
has
not
heard
these
witnesses
and
hasn't
had
the
opportunity
to
know
whether...
whether,
for
example,
these...
this
testimony
about
the
confession
was
credible
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
hearer
of...
at
the
trial
did
have
that
opportunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
evidence
of
rape
besides...
besides
the
semen.
the
semen
wasn't
the
only
evidence
of
rape,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
were
scratches
on
the
thighs.
