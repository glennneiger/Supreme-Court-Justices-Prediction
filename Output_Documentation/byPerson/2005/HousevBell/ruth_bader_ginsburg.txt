said
blood
of
the
victim.
you
don't
contest
that
this
was
the
blood
of
the
victim.
the
question
is
at
what
point
did
it
get
transferred
to
the
jeans.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
no
question
about
it
being
someone
else's
blood.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
will
you
also
cover,
because
your
time
is
short,
if
you
get
through
the
gateway
on
your
actual
innocence
contention,
what
are
your
constitutional
claims
that
lie
behind
it?
because
i
don't
think
much
was
said
about
in
the
briefs.
what
is
it
that
you
would...
you
would
say
if
you
got
through
the
gate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
smith,
would...
could
you
focusing
on
this,
what's
called
a
finding,
although
the
district
judge
himself
puts
it
under
conclusions
of
law,
just...
the
court
concludes
that
the
spillage
occurred
after
the
fbi
crime
laboratory
received
and
tested
the
evidence.
what
is
the
basis,
the
specific
basis,
for
that
conclusion,
that
it
occurred
after
the
fbi
tested
the
evidence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
then
there
was
also
the
evidence
that
was
not
disputed,
that
it
was
a
dry
day
and
that
there
was
no
mud
at
all
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
it
was
agreed
that
there...
that
the
site
where
the
body
was
found,
that
that
was
dry,
that
that
was
dry
ground.
i
thought
there
was
no
dispute
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
she
did
testify
that
there
was
a
car
out
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
rest
of
the
story
doesn't...
doesn't
put
the
defendant
house
at
the
time
of
the
crime
in
a
car.
he's
walking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
happened
at
the
same
time,
didn't
they?
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
child
testified
to
what
she
heard,
and
i
thought
she
heard
a
car
and
someone
in
a
low
voice,
and
then
her
mother
left
with
that
someone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
at
the
sentencing
stage?
justice
kennedy
brought
it
up.
the...
the
prosecutor
didn't
emphasize
unduly
the
semen
at
the...
at
the
guilt
stage
but,
boy,
made
a
big
deal
out
of
it
at
the
sentencing
stage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
was
it
in
the...
in
the
joint
appendix?
i
thought
it
was
more
than
kidnapping.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
said
nothing
about
the
semen--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--at
the...
at
the
sentencing
stage?
