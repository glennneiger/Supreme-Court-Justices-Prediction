chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
house
v.
bell.
mr.
kissinger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the...
so
the...
we
would
have
to
be
finding
in
this
case,
if
we
ruled
in
your
favor,
that
we
think
the
trial
judge
is
unreasonable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
could
i
step...
step
back
a
little
bit
to
get...
to
get
back
to
the
standard
of
review?
because
i
think
it's
an
unusual
one.
you
started
out
by
talking
about
what
the
first
jury
knew
and
didn't
know,
but
we
are
in
no
sense
reviewing
that
jury
determination.
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
are
supposed
to
look
at
all
of
the
evidence,
the
new
evidence
and
the
old
evidence,
and
determine
simply
whether
or
not
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
any
juror
to
vote
to
convict
on
the
basis
of
all
of
that
evidence.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
in
other
words,
no
reasonable
juror...
no...
no
juror
could
reasonably
vote
to
convict.
in
other
words,
if
we
look
at
this
evidence
and
think
that...
and
again,
we're
not
reviewing
the
prior
jury's
evidence.
if
we
look
at
this
and
say,
maybe
a
jury
would
come
out
10
to
2
in
favor
of
acquittal,
if
we
think
that
would
be
reasonable,
then
you
lose.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
my
hypothetical
there
are
two
reasonable
jurors
who
vote
to
convict.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kissinger.
ms.
smith,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
bigbee...
bigbee
was
explaining
what
he
meant
when
he
wrote
inc.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
was
different
than
what
dr.
blake
said
it
meant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
get
back
to
this...
the
standard
of
review
question?
because
it
goes
directly
to
this
point.
even
if
you
think
that
the
argument
based
on
the
semen
is
not
harmless
error,
in
other
words,
that
the
prior
jury
may
well
have
convicted
based
on
that,
we're
not
reviewing
that
jury's
determination.
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
should
be
looking
at
the
case
with
the
semen
evidence
showing
what
we
know
it
to
show,
regardless
of
whether
we
think
the
prior
jury
was
misled
by
the
admission
of
that
evidence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kissinger,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
page
282
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
says
inconclusive
is
what
the
inc
stands
for.
dr.
blake
testified
it
is
incomplete
penetration,
which
i
haven't
the
foggiest
idea
what
that
means.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
