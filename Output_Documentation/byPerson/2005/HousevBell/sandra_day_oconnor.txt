the

of
the
podium
a
little
so

can
hear
you?

not
much.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was

there
was
no
such

at
the

justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
years
ago
was
this
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor

you
going
to
mention
any
of
the
other,
or
are
we
going
to
just
deal
with
the
blood
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
did
the
jury
hear
about
