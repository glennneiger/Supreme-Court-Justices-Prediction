justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did
it
rest
on?
what...
what
is
the
district
court's
conclusion?
the
court
concludes
that
the
spillage
occurred
after
the
fbi
crime
lab
received
and
tested
the
evidence.
what
does
that
rest
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
any
reasonable
juror
would
have
had
to
have
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
you're
saying
yes,
any
reasonable
juror
would
have
had
to
have
a
reasonable
doubt
irrespective
of
what
the
trial
judge
found.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
mentioned...
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg,
you
didn't
mention...
and
perhaps
it
was
inadvertent.
if
not,
i
want
to
know
why
not.
i
thought
if
you
get
through
the
gate,
what
you're
going
to
say
is
the
state
should
have
given
us
evidence
that
they
had
that
showed
that
mr.
muncey
had
sexual
relations
with
his
wife
the
morning
of
the
killing,
and
therefore,
the
semen
that
they
found
didn't
necessarily
belong
to
your
client,
but
rather
belonged
to
him.
as
it
turned
out,
it
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
going
to
make
that
brady
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
any
reasonable
juror
would
have
to
have
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
was...
how
was
that?
i
thought
you'd
go
on
to
say
how
that...
how
was
it?
i...
i
read
that
dr.
blake
said
this.
he
said,
look,
i...
there...
there
are
tiny
little
specks
of
blood
on
the
jeans
and
we
test
them.
they
were
tested.
and
they
show
that
a
certain
enzyme
deteriorated
to
degree
x,
and
that's
true
of
the
test
tube
blood
as
well.
both
deteriorated
to
degree
x.
but
if
you
take
fresh
blood
and
splatter
it,
there
will
be
no
deterioration.
so
conclusion,
the
blood
on
the
jeans
came
from
the
test
tube.
now,
you
say
that
was
discredited,
but
i
didn't
read
anywhere
anything
that
discredited
it.
what
was
the
discrediting
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
meant
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
incomplete,
and
what
did
the
fbi
man
say
it
was?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he...
he
says
it
meant
incomplete.
and
what
do
you...
what
did...
what
did
dr.
bigbee
say
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now...
i...
dr.
blake,
you
just
said,
said
that
the
word
inc
meant
incomplete.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
say
dr.
bigbee
discredited
that
by
saying,
no,
it
didn't
mean
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
meant
something
else.
what
is
the
something
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
now,
all
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't
know
how
much.
now,
i
have
on
page
119,
which
they
cite,
of
the
transcript
mr.
pruden
is
talking
to
mr....
dr.
blake.
would
your
opinion
change,
doctor,
if
the,
quote,
inc
notation
meant
inconclusive
rather
than
incomplete
penetration?
answer,
same
difference.
question,
so
your
opinion
would
not
change?
answer,
that
is
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
would
have
been
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
you
if,
in
fact,
you
think
that
this
is
not
true
that
enzyme
gl706bx,
contrary
to
what
dr.
blake
said,
had
not
deteriorated
in
the
blood
spot,
do
a
test.
find
out
if
it's
deteriorated
or
not.
can't...
can't
that
be
done?
i
mean,
dr.
blake
in
this
part
is
reading
his
own
report.
his
own
report
says
the
enzyme
deteriorated
in
the
spots
on
the
jeans,
and
i
see
nothing
here
that
says
to
the
contrary.
but
if
that
weren't
true,
the
blood
is
right
there,
and
if
it
weren't
true
that
it
had
deteriorated,
i
would
have
expected
testimony,
at
the
least,
saying
no,
dr.
blake,
you
are
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
blood
did
not
deteriorate.
the
enzyme
did
not
deteriorate.
but
there
is
no
such
testimony.
instead,
you
seem
to
be
relying
on
the
difference
between
the
word
incomplete
and
inclusive,
a
difference
that
dr.
blake
says
is
inclusive
or
incomplete.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
the
answer
to
my
question?
because
i
do
think
it
turns
on
this.
a
lot
does.
the
trial
judge
sat
there
and
said
this
is
very
important.
dr.
blake
is
quoting
from
something
called
part
5,
which
i
thought
was
his
report.
and
then
the
trial
judge
says,
where
did
you
get
that
idea?
where
did
you
get
that
idea,
that
the...
that
the
enzyme
wasn't
there
in...
in
the
jeans'
blood?
where
did
you
get
it?
and
he
says
i
got
it
from
the
fbi
report,
i
think.
he's
not
certain
because
he's
remembering
his
own
conclusion.
he
isn't
quite
sure
where
he
got
it
from.
and
now
it
turns
out
that
the
inc
when
they...
it
said
inc,
which
he
thought
meant
there
isn't
much
enzyme
there.
and
then
they
say,
well,
maybe
it
meant
inclusive.
and
he
says,
that
wouldn't
matter
because
i
guess
i
took
it
to
mean
that
too
would
show
there
wasn't
much
enzyme
there.
both
would
come
to
the
same
thing.
and
now,
if
i'm
sitting
there
and
thinking,
i'm
thinking,
well,
either
there
is
or
there
isn't
this
enzyme
in
the...
in
the
blood
that's
right
there.
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
prove.
and
if
somebody
is
going
to
dispute
it,
the
state
will
come
back
and
say,
no,
no,
the
enzyme
is
there.
but
they
didn't.
so
i
read
the
testimony
and
i
read
the
fact
that
you
didn't
dispute
it
with
any
evidence
that's
saying,
yes,
the
enzyme
is
not
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
did?
where
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
doesn't
mean
it
isn't
present
isn't
quite
the
same
thing,
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
another
blood
question
because
i...
the...
you
make
a
point
of
the...
the
sheriff
having
said,
well,
i...
i
saw
blood
on
the
jeans.
so
i
looked
at
the
pictures
and
the
pictures
seem
to
have
little
tiny
bits
of
blood,
while
a
lot
of
mud.
so
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
no
reasonable
person
could
think
that
that
testimony
really
shows
that
the...
that
there
was...
there
was
blood
from
the...
from
the
victim
on
his
jeans.
now,
am
i
right
about
that?
you're
going
to
think
i'm
wrong,
and
i
want
to
hear
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
you
have?
it's
so
tiny.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
overall,
if...
looking
at
this...
and
that's
why
i
think
the
question
about
the
weight
to
give
to
the
fact
finding
is
important.
you
think...
you
have
a
theory
under
which
he
could
have
done
it,
and
it's
certainly
possible
in
my
opinion.
but
also
you
think,
my
goodness,
if
he
did
it,
going
and
this
luring
of
the
woman
to
the
creek...
you
know,
there's
nothing
else
in
the
record
that
suggests
he
would
plot
in
that
way
to
do
this.
nothing.
the
husband
is
away
at
the
time
from
the
dance.
he
could
have
done
it.
they
are
fighting.
they
could
have
done
it.
and
if
the
luring
theory
correct,
the
motive
was
sexual,
but
the
sexual
physical
evidence
is
from
the
husband,
not
from
him.
so
the
jury
is
brought
into
this
on
a
theory
that
there
is
a
sexual
attack
and
the
one...
by
the
defendant,
and
the
one
thing
that
seems
disproved
pretty
much
is
that.
and
now
we
have
two
experts,
dr.
blake
and
dr.
bigbee.
and
reading
a
page,
which
i
hadn't
read
thoroughly
until
you
pointed
it
out,
i'd
say
they
might
disagree.
they
might
disagree.
and
it's
just
not
conclusive.
so
if
you're
sitting
there,
do
you
have
to
have
a
reasonable
doubt
when
there's
such
strong
evidence
for
both
people?
and...
and
the
part
that's
bothering
me...
i...
i
see
what
that
district
judge
said
on
that
one
point,
which
he
may
have
thought
was
peripheral
but
it
turns
out
to
be
quite
important
about
when
the
blood
spilled.
but
if
you
look
to
the
underlying
thing
and
i
think,
well,
maybe
you're
right,
but
maybe
you're
not
right.
and
so
how
do...
how
do
i...
how
do
i
do
this?
what's
the...
what's
the
weighing?
i
sit
there
and
think,
my
goodness,
i
don't
know
who
committed
this
crime
if
i'd
been
on
that
jury.
and
could...
could
a
person
sitting
there
reasonably
come
to
a
conclusion,
my
goodness,
i
know?
