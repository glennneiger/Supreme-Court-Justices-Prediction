justice
david
h.
souter
well,
didn't...
you...
you
have
accepted
justice
scalia's
formulation,
but
my
understanding
is
that
schlup
did
not
say
no
reasonable
juror
could.
schlup
said
no
reasonable
juror
would
have.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean,
it's
would,
not
could.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
would
imply
a
sufficiency
of
evidence
possibility
of
analyzing
it,
but
the
would
language
excludes
a
sufficiency
of
evidence.
the...
the
would
formulation
says,
in
effect,
what
would
the
reasonable
juror
actually
have
done.
is
that
your
understanding?
i
mean,
is
that
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
wasn't
the
district
court
incorrect
in
that?
because
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
evidence
from
one
of
the
two
witnesses
who
put
in
the
confession
evidence
that
she
had
gone
to
the
sheriff's
department
to...
to
tell
them
about
the
confession
and
had
simply
gotten
a
runaround
and
finally
left.
so
as
i
understand
it,
the...
the
record
would
not
support
the
finding
that...
that
the...
the
sources
of
evidence
simply
kept
silent
for
over
a
decade.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
there
any
reason
not...
did
the...
did
the
district
court
explain
that
it
was
rejecting
that
element
of
the
witnesses'
testimonies?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know,
but
without
getting
to
that
point,
it
sounds
as
though
the
district
court
simply
made
a
mistake,
just
forgot
i
suppose,
the
evidence
that
the
witness
didn't
wait
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
finding
of...
of
incredibility
was
the
decade
or
more
of
silence.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the...
tell...
help
me
out
here.
as...
as
has
been
explored
earlier,
the
confession
referred
to...
to
some
of
the
injuries
on
the
body,
but
not
to
all
of
them.
were
there...
were
there
other
disparities
between
the
confession
and...
and
the...
and
other
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that...
that
says
if
the...
it
seems
to
me
you're
simply
saying
there
would
be
sufficient
evidence
to
go
the
one
way
rather
than
the
other.
and...
and
you
may
well
be
right
about
that,
but
that
certainly
is
not
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
may
i
interrupt
you?
what...
what
about...
i
want
to
just
follow
up
on
something
that
justice
breyer
alluded
to
and
that
is
the
significance
of
the
dna
evidence.
and
i
have
tended
to...
to
think
that
a
reasonable
juror
would
look
at
it
this
way,
but
if
i'm
wrong,
i...
i
want
you
to
comment
on
it.
one
of
the...
i...
i
assume,
to
begin
with,
that
any
reasonable
juror
would
have
found
this
evidence,
the
evidence
of
the
semen
stains,
extremely
significant
because
not
only
did
the
state
argue
rape
as
a...
as
a
motive,
possible
motive,
but
there
was
a
specific
finding
of
an
aggravated
circumstance
that
the
murder
occurred
in
the
course
of
kidnapping
and
rape.
i
don't
know
of
any
evidence
that
would
suggest
an...
an
independent
kidnapping
crime
without
the
rape
element
under,
you
know,
the
circumstances
of...
of
this
crime.
so
i'm...
i...
i
assume
that
the
reasonable
juror,
having
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that
aggravating
circumstance
is
true,
found
that
a
rape
was
being
committed.
if
that
juror
had
heard
the
dna
evidence,
that
juror
would
have
said
the
only
positive
evidence
that
a
rape
was
committed
here
would
be
evidence
that
pointed
to
the
husband,
not
in
fact
to...
to
the
defendant
house.
and
if...
if
a
juror
had
heard
that
evidence,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
any
reasonable
juror
would
have
concluded
that
that
aggravating
circumstance
was
found,
and
i
suppose
that
would
play
a...
a
significant
role
in...
in
the
ultimate
conclusion.
now,
you
have
argued
that
the
fact
that
the
dna
evidence
shows
that
it
was
the
husband's
fluids,
not
house's,
doesn't
conclusively
prove
that
house
didn't
rape
her,
and
of
course,
you're
right.
but
my
understanding
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
from
which
one
would
reasonably
infer
that
house
did
this.
now,
what
is...
what
is
your
comment
on
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
