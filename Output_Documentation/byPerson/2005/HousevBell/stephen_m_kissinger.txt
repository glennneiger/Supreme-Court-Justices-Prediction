mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
the
jurors
which--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--is
that
better,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
one
more
sound
check.
does
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--thank
you.
the
jurors
who
convicted
mr.
house
of
first
degree
murder
heard
that
semen
stains
on
the
victim's
clothing
matched
mr.
house.
they
didn't
hear
the
dna
evidence
which
showed
that
not
to
be
the
case.
the
jurors
heard--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
the
trial,
your
honor,
was
approximately
20
years
ago.
the
jurors
who
convicted
mr.
house
heard
that
bloodstains
on
mr.
house's
blue
jeans
matched
the
blood
belonging
to
the
victim.
they
didn't
hear
the
assistant
chief
medical
examiner
for
the
state
of
tennessee
testify
that
the
source
of
those
bloodstains
was
a
sample
taken
during
ms.
muncey's
autopsy,
nor
did
they
hear--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
justice
scalia,
the
court
made
a
conclusion
that
the
blood
which
had
spilt
from
the
tube
had
spilt
after...
after
the
blood
had
been
tested.
it
did
not,
however,
make
a
factual
finding.
it
made
a
conclusion
of
law
regarding
that,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
it
is,
your
honor.
if
the
court
were
to
look
at
the
district
court
order,
the
district
court
order
was
divided
into
two
distinct
parts.
the
first
part--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--your
honor,
what
the
district...
what
the
district
court
concluded
as
a
matter
of
law
was
that
it...
that
notwithstanding
dr.
blake's
testimony
regarding
the
source
of
the
blood
found
on
mr.
house's
jeans,
that
that
did
not
eliminate
the...
eliminate
the
testimony
of
agent
scott
who
said
that
he
saw
blood
on
the
jeans
when
he
first...
excuse
me.
let
me
rephrase
that
because
it's
actually
a
critical
matter.
he
saw
what
he
thought
appeared
to
be
bloodstains
on
the
jeans
when
he
first
picked
them
up.
what
the
district
court
did
in
that
instance
was
exactly
the
error
that
mr.
house
has
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
court,
which
is
in
the
face
of
evidence
of
innocence,
the
district
court,
simply
because
it
found
some
contrary
evidence
in
the
record,
found
that
mr.
house
had
failed
to
make
his
showing.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--justice
scalia,
we
actually
make
two
claims
regarding
that.
first,
that
that
was
a
conclusion
of
law
entitled
to...
entitled
to
de
novo
review.
second,
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--second,
justice
scalia,
if
indeed
it
was
a
finding
of
fact,
yes,
that
finding
of
fact
was
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
your
honor,
on
the
basis
of
the
entirety
of
the
record,
which
is
what
this
court
instructed
the
district
court
to
examine
when
it
conducts
the
schlup
inquiry.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
your
honor,
including
not
only
that
testimony,
but
the
testimony
of
the
same
expert
who
made
the
statements
which
the
court
just
cited,
who
said
that
she
was
unable...
that
she
was
excluding
merely
the
direct
spillage,
the
pouring
of
blood
onto
the
jeans,
and
conceded
in
her
testimony
that
the
transfer
stains
which
she
observed,
the
type
of
stains
which
she
observed
could,
in
fact,
have
been...
that
she
had
no
opinion
as
to
the
cause
of
those,
only
that
it
was
the
result
of
one
object
wiping
against
another
object.
also,
in
light
of
the
testimony
regarding--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--justice
scalia--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--justice
scalia,
there...
there
are
two
things
which
come
into
the...
into
the
court's
analysis.
first
is
the
court
is
correct.
the
burden
is
quite
high,
and
it's...
it's
high
for
a
reason.
it's
justifiably
high.
we
don't
shrink
from
that
burden,
your
honor.
what
we
say
is
that
along
with
that
burden,
the
court
also
requires
that
the
entirety
of
the
evidence
be
reviewed.
if
the
entirety
of
the
evidence
is
reviewed
and
the
effect
of
the
entirety
of
the
evidence
on
a
properly
instructed,
reasonable
juror...
that's
the
nature
of
the...
the
determination...
what
effect
will
that
have?
when
we
look
at
the
facts
in
this
case,
when
we
look
at
the
blood
evidence
in
this
case,
yes,
we
don't
deny
that
there
is
evidence
which
could
support
conviction.
however,
that
is
not
the
test
in
schlup.
schlup
specifically
rejected
that
inquiry.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
your
honor,
quite
frankly,
we
can't
determine
that...
that
statement
rests
on
anything.
the
undisputed
evidence
in
the
record
consists
of
a
photograph
of
the
blood
samples
at
the
time
they
were
received
by
the
defense
expert.
the
box
was
opened.
a
photograph
was
taken.
the
photograph
shows
clearly
that
one
entire
tube
of
blood
is
missing
and
the
second
tube
of
blood
has
leaked
within
the
packaging.
but
the
record
also
contains
the
testimony
of
the
tbi
agent
who
transported
the
blood
from
the
fbi
to
the
defense
expert
who
said
he
observed
no
blood
that
leaked
other
than
the...
other
than
what
was
inside
the
container.
it
also
contains
the
testimony
of
the
fbi
agent
who
tested
the
blood
at
the
fbi
who
said
two
things.
one,
i
used
no...
no
more
than
one
quarter
of
a
tube
of
blood
and
that
no
blood
spilt
while
the
tube
was
in
the
possession
of
the
fbi.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
your
honor,
two...
two
things
to...
two
things
to
point
out
there.
first
is
that
that
eliminates
only
one
possible
hypothesis
and
that
is
the
hypothesis
that
blood
was
directly
spilt
onto...
onto
the...
onto
the
jeans.
i
think
the
example
that
the
expert
gave
was
these
are
not
stains,
for
example,
the
pouring
of
a...
like
coffee...
pouring
coffee
onto
the
lap
of
your
jeans
or
something
like
that.
these
are
simply
transfers,
one
bloody
object
wiped
against
another.
so
while
she
gave
a
hypothesis
of
guilt...
and
again,
your
honor,
it
comes
to
the
could
and
would
distinction.
if
it...
that
could
be
considered
evidence
of
guilt,
what
would
a...
but,
however,
that's
not
the
inquiry.
the
inquiry
is
what
would
a
reasonable
juror
who
heard
that
on
one
side,
that
it
didn't
spill
directly,
but
on
the
other
side,
heard
the
evidence
that
we
began...
that
i
began
to
discuss
with
justice
breyer,
which
is
the
evidence
of
the
tbi
agent,
the
photographic
evidence,
the
evidence
of
the
fbi
agent,
the
evidence
that
the
styrofoam
box
was
opened
during
transit
to
the
fbi
and
that
objects
were
removed
from
it
during
transit.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
justice
kennedy,
in
terms
of
the...
the
size
of...
of
the
bloodstains,
it
was
significant
to
the
extent
that
it
bears
upon
the
probative
value
of
the
testimony
of
charles
scott
when
he
says...
when
he
said
he
saw
what
he
thought
might
be
stains.
as
a
simple
matter
of
fact,
this...
the
jeans
were
stained
with
a
number
of
substances,
not
just
blood,
and
a
number
of
witnesses,
including
the
trial
prosecutor
himself,
described
the
bloodstains
as
actually
so
small
that
they
were
difficult
to
detect
by
the
human
eye.
the
second
part
of
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
yes.
that
evidence
was
available.
and
our
position
is
that
it...
that
goes
actually
to
the
substance
of
our
constitutional
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
trial
counsel
had
in
his
possession...
or
his
expert
certainly
had
in
his
possession
the
photograph
that
showed
an
entire
tube
of
blood
missing.
therefore,
he
had
evidence
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
blood.
trial
counsel
was
actually
concerned
about
this
blood.
he
filed
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
this
blood
evidence.
here's
trial
counsel
with
evidence
that
blood
is
missing.
he
knows
it's
a
critical
issue
in
the
case
and
he
failed
to
go
out
and
hire
someone
like
the
assistant
chief
medical
examiner
for
the
state
of
tennessee
who
came
into
federal
court
and
testified
as
to
the...
that
the
source
of
this
blood
was,
in
fact,
that
empty
tube.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
your
honor,
two
matters
on
that.
again,
the
proof
of
innocence
does
not
have
to
be
absolute.
this
court
stated
in
schlup
that
the
fact
that
there
is
still
some
evidence
of
guilt
or
that
there
still
exists
even
substantial
evidence
of
guilt
does
not
prevent
a
defendant
from
passing
through
the
schlup
gateway.
the
second
matter
and
one
which
i
think
is
important
is
that
as
a
matter
of
tennessee
law,
a
circumstantial
evidence
case
requires
not
only
that
the
prosecution
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
that
it
eliminate
all
reasonable
hypotheses
of
innocence.
so
even
if
a
jury
could
conclude
that
the
blood
came
during...
that
the
blood
got
on
the
jeans
during
the
course
of
the
crime,
it
would
also
have
to
be
able...
it
would
also
have
to
be
probable
that
the
same
jury
would
also
conclude
that
it
was
an
impossibility
for
mr.
blake...
dr.
blake's
testimony
to
be
correct.
so,
in
fact,
it's
dr.
blake's
testimony
which
has
to
be
impossible
to...
to
accept
in
order
for
a
jury
to
find...
a
reasonable
juror
to
find--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
question
has
been,
from
the
beginning
of
this
case,
when
the
blood
came
to
get
on
mr.
house's
jeans.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
justice
scalia,
i...
i
would
disagree
with...
with
the
court's
analysis
there.
i...
i
think
what...
what
the
issue
here
is
more
whether,
given
the
testimony
of
dr.
blake,
given
the
corroborating
evidence
that
supports
dr.
blake's
testimony,
would
a
reasonable
juror
have
doubts
or
would
any
reasonable
juror
have
a...
retain
a
reasonable...
excuse
me--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--let
me
rephrase
that,
justice
scalia.
the
question
is,
given
the
tennessee
jury
instruction--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--yes,
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
your
honor,
that's
actually
not
correct
either.
schlup
specifically
says
that
the
function
of
the
district
judge
in
a
schlup
hearing
is
not
to
make
an
independent
judgment
on
the
evidence
in
front
of
him,
but
to
make
a
probabilistic
determination
of
the
effect
of
the
evidence
on
a
reasonable
juror.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
your
honor,
first,
we...
we
believe
we
have...
have
shown
that
it's
clearly
erroneous.
second,
even
viewing
the
blood
evidence
separately,
even
saying,
well,
mr.
house
has
put
up
some
evidence
of...
some
evidence
of
innocence
regarding
this
blood
evidence,
but
not
enough
to
really
sway
me
regarding
that,
that
evidence
itself
has
to
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
entire
record.
and
in
light
of
the
entire
record,
that
blood
evidence,
standing
alone
in
its
even
somewhat
compromised
state,
no
reasonable
juror
would
be
able
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
mr.
house
was
guilty
because
the
remaining
evidence
of
his
innocence
is
also
very
substantial.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
justice
o'connor,
we...
we
would
like
to
move
on
to...
to
some
of
the
other
evidence
because
it...
it
is
substantial.
and
we've
set...
we've
set
out
a
lot
of
that
evidence
beginning
at
page
6
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
justice
ginsburg,
as...
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
we
believe
that
we
have
numerous
instances
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
first,
counsel's
failure
to...
upon
knowing
of
the
importance
of
the
blood
evidence,
which
he
clearly
did
because
he
raised...
raised
the
issue
himself,
upon
knowing
of
the
photograph
showing
the
missing
blood,
he
failed
to
go
forward
and
basically
do
what
we
did
in
federal
court,
which
was
hire
an
expert
to
look
at
the
results
of
the
fbi
testing
and
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
viable
defense...
a
viable
defense
strategy
available
there,
which
he
did
not.
also,
if
we
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
where
trial
counsel
also
pointed
toward
hubert
muncey,
jr.
as
the
actual
perpetrator
of
this
crime.
he
actually
called
the
sister
of
the
victim
to
say
that
his
sister
was
afraid
of
mr.
muncey
and
that
she
had
plans
to
leave
him.
when
we
look
at
what
was
available
to
trial
counsel
there,
we
see
five
witnesses,
many
of
whom
were
friends
of
mr.
muncey,
who
presented
evidence
that
showed
that
on
the
night
of
ms.
muncey's
murder,
mr.
muncey
and
ms.
muncey
had
a
fight
at
the
c&c
recreation
center,
that
ms.
muncey
went
home,
that
mr.
muncey
followed
her
there,
that
he
confessed
that
when
he
returned
home,
he
was
angry
and
drunk,
that
they
began
to
argue
again,
that
he
struck
her
in
the
head,
that
she
fell,
that
he
checked
her
lifeless
body
and
found
she
was
dead,
and
that
he
hid
her
body
in
the
bushes.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
justice
scalia,
there...
there
are
two
issues
there.
in
fact,
the...
the
pathologist's
testimony
and...
and
the
law
enforcement
officer's
testimony
is
consistent
to
the
extent
that
the
injuries
which
mr.
muncey
described
inflicting
were,
in
fact,
inflicted
upon
the
victim.
there
were
those
injuries.
the
point...
the
fact
that
there
were
additional
injuries
to
the
victim...
to
the
victim
assumes
that
somehow
mr.
muncey's
independent,
short
confession,
because,
remember,
when
he
started
to
confess...
after
he
makes
this
confession,
he's
rushed
out
of
the
home
and
told
that
they
don't
want
to
hear
anything.
this
isn't
a
situation
of
like
a
law
enforcement...
a
confession
made
to
law
enforcement
where
once
obtaining
evidence
of
guilt,
law
enforcement
pursues
and
tries
to
get
as
many
of
the
details
out
of
it.
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
be...
it's
significant
or
it
would
be
significant
to
any
reasonable
juror
that
mr.
muncey
did
not
describe
every
single
injury
that
he
inflicted
on
ms.
muncey
that
night.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
we...
we
are
going
to
also
make
the
brady
claim.
in
addition,
your
honor,
if
indeed
that
evidence
was
available
to
trial
counsel,
who
did
talk
to
mr.
muncey,
who
was
able
to
interview
mr.
muncey,
and
failed
to
ask
mr.
muncey
whether
he
had
had
sexual
relationships
with
his
wife,
even
though
trial
counsel
attempted
ineffectively
at
trial
to...
to
show
that...
that
that
semen
belonged
to
mr.
muncey.
so
it's
one
of
those
situations,
justice
breyer,
where
there
is
either
brady
for
the
state's
failure
to
turn
it
over,
or
if
it
was
available,
it's
another
instance
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
that
is
correct,
justice
roberts.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
your
honor,
what
schlup
says
is
that
we
are
to
step
back
and
see
whether
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
no...
that
any
reasonable
juror
would
vote
to
convict.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
would
have...
would
have...
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
chief
justice
roberts,
i--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--chief
justice
roberts,
the
danger
in
that
hypothetical
is
that
we
are
approaching
an
area
where
the
definition
of
the
reasonable
juror
becomes
something
subjective.
the
definition
of
a
reasonable
juror
is
not
a
subjective
inquiry.
in
fact,
it's
a...
it's
an
objective
inquiry.
so
to
that
extent,
i
would
have
to
disagree
with...
with
your
analysis
or
your...
or
your
hypothetical,
which
is
that
maybe
there
might
be
two
jurors
out
there
who
would
listen
to
this
evidence
and
vote
to
convict
mr.
house.
i
don't
think
that's
a
correct
statement--
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
court
in...
i
believe
the
court
in
schlup
took
the
word
reasonable
to
encompass
the
point
which
i
have
just
made.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
and
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
it...
it
is
would.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
that
is,
justice
souter.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
what
would
any
reasonable
juror,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
i
believe
the
language
is
any.
well,
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
very
quickly.
dr.
blake's
testimony
was
not,
in
fact,
discredited.
counsel
for
respondent
says
that...
places
great
significance
on...
on
dr.
blake's
interpretation
of
the
initials
inc
as
standing
for
incomplete
penetration,
and
that...
correctly
that
should
have
been
construed
as
inconclusive.
counsel
fails
to
acknowledge
the
record...
record

of
the
district
court,
volume
6,
page
906.
agent
bigbee
himself
uses
the
term
inc
to
mean...
or
incomplete,
just
as
dr.
blake
did.
so
in
addition
to
dr.
blake
saying,
yes,
i
meant
the
same
thing
as
justice
breyer
observed,
justice
bigbee
himself
uses
the
term
inc
to
mean
incomplete.
mr.
stephen
m.
kissinger
and
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
trial,
he
used...
he
said
that
inc
stands
for
incomplete,
and
then
agent
bigbee
at
trial
proceeded
to
use
incomplete
and
inconclusive
interchangeably
just
as
dr.
blake
did.
in
addition,
when...
concerning
dr.
blake's
testimony,
we
have
to
remember
that
we
still
have
the
missing
tube
of
blood,
and
the
blood
on
the
jeans
is
more
consistent
with
blood
coming
from
the
degraded
blood
sample
than
it
is
from
blood
which
came...
got
on
the
jeans
during
the
time
of
the
offense.
the
other
thing,
which
i
think
is
an
important
matter
to...
to
keep
in...
keep
in
mind
regarding
dr.
blake's
testimony
and
dr.
bigbee's,
is
that
dr.
blake
and
agent
bigbee
both
agree
on
the
basic
science
that
blood
enzymes
deteriorate
according
the
various
environmental
factors
and
that
as
they
deteriorate,
they
become
less
detectable.
in
terms
of
the...
the
implicit
credibility
findings,
which
respondent
relies
upon,
the
district
court
during
its
opinion
demonstrated
that
it
know...
it
knew
how
to
make
credibility
findings.
in
fact,
it
made
two
specific
credibility
findings
in
this
case
when
it
found
mr.
house's
testimony
to
be
incredible
and
the
testimony
of
lora
muncey
to
be
credible.
as
far
as
the...
the
suggestion
that,
yes,
there
was...
the
crime
scene
was
wet,
that
that...
that
there
was
water
at...
or
there's
a
possibility
of
mud
at
the
crime
scene,
not
only
is
this
contradicted
by
the
absence
of
the
mud...
of
mud
on
the
victim's
clothing,
but
also
the
drizzling
which
counsel
described
occurred
on
the
day
following
the
murder,
not
before
it
happened,
not
at
the
time
the
murder
was
occurring,
but
on
the
day
following
the
murder.
so,
in
fact,
there
was...
the
murder
scene
was
dry,
just
as
petitioner
has
informed
the
court.
as
far
as
the
daughter
not
hearing
any
sign
of
a
struggle,
the
daughter's
testimony
was
that
she
did
not
hear
any
sign
of
a
struggle
when
she
got
up
immediately
after
her
mother
left
the
home.
the
testimony
at
the
evidentiary
hearing,
unrebutted
and
unimpeached,
was
that
at
that
point
in
time
when
she
was
hearing
nothing,
her
mother
was,
in
fact,
at
the
c&c
recreation
center
involved
in
a
fight
with
hubert
muncey,
jr.
in
fact,
that
testimony
goes
to
mr.
house's
innocence
because
at
the
time
she
hears
nothing,
she
hears
no
sign
of
a
struggle,
is
the
very
time
that
the
state
of
tennessee
contended
that
mr.
house
was
out
murdering
carolyn
muncey,
and
yet
the
daughter
who
was
outside
of
the
home
within
50
yards
of
where
this
murder
occurred
heard
absolutely
nothing.
justice
scalia
asked
was
there,
in
fact,
other
evidence
of...
of
rape.
wasn't
there,
in
fact,
bruises
found
on
her
thighs?
on
cross
examination,
the
pathologist
testified,
admitted
on
cross
examination,
that
the
scratches
on
ms.
muncey's
thighs
were
more
likely
attributable
to
her
being
dragged
through
the
brush
and
her
body
being
hidden
which,
incidentally,
is
an
act
which
mr.
muncey
confessed
to
doing.
in
addition,
as
i
stated
before,
the
evidence
has
to
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
entirety
of
the
evidence
of
the
record.
it
isn't
just
the
blood
evidence.
it
isn't
just
the
semen
evidence.
it
isn't
even
just
the
confession.
it's
also
the
fact
that
the
same
witness
who
puts
mr.
muncey...
or
who
mr.
house
even
leaving
the
donna
turner
home
on
the
night
of
the
murder
puts
mr.
house
leaving
the
home
at
a...
thank
you,
your
honor.
