ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
evidence
presented
in
the
district
court
fails
to
raise
sufficient
doubt
about
mr.
house's
guilt
to
justify
review
of
his
procedurally
defaulted
claims
because
reasonable
jurors
would
not
ignore
the
fact
that
mr.
house's
jeans
were
stained
with
the
blood
of
carolyn
muncey.
that
is
a
fact
that
has
not
been
undermined
by
any
of
the
evidence
presented
in
the
federal
habeas
proceeding.
the
enzymatic
degradation
theory
of
dr.
blake
was
so
thoroughly
discredited
in
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing
that
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
any
reasonable
juror,
viewing
all
the
evidence,
would
be
convinced
by
it,
let
alone
that
everyone
would
vote
to
acquit
in
light
of
it.
in
fact,
the
petitioner's
evidence
of
innocence
was
disputed
in
nearly
every
respect
and
sorely--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that
was
specifically
discredited
by
the...
by
the
testimony
of
agent
bigbee.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
dr.
blake's
specific
opinion
was
that
his
interpretation
of
the
enzyme
marker
study,
specifically
the
glo1
enzyme
on
the
jeans
and
on
the
vial--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--showed
inc...
inc--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--which
he
took
to
mean
incomplete
penetrance.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
agent
bigbee
specifically
disputed
not
only
the
literal
interpretation
of
that,
in
that
it
doesn't
mean
incomplete
penetrance.
in
fact,
agent
bigbee
did
not
know
what
that
even
meant
in
the
area
of
serology,
but
he...
he
disagreed
with
the
meaning
that
dr.
blake
ascribed
to
that...
to
that
definition...
to
that
notation.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
which
dr.
blake
concluded
that--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--agent
bigbee
testified...
or
dr.
blake
testified
that
the
inc
meant
that
the
enzyme
was
not
present,
that
it
had
dropped
out.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
dr.
blake
said
it
was
not
present.
it
had
dropped
out.
agent--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that's
correct.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
agent
bigbee
testified
that
inc
means--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--inclusive--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--which
means
that
the
enzyme
is
present--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--but
that
he
could
not
subtype
it.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
but
the...
the
dispute
goes
beyond
the
literal
interpretation
of
the
inc.
it
goes
to
the
meaning
ascribed
to
it.
and
agent
bigbee
disagreed
that
dr.
blake...
with
dr.
blake's
conclusion
that
the
inc
indicated
that
the
enzyme
had
dropped
out
of
the
sample.
he
said
it
was
present.
it
could
not
be
typed.
agent
bigbee
also
disagreed
with
dr.
blake's
overarching
theory
that
there
was
equal
deterioration
in
the
vials...
in
the
blood
in
the
vials
and
the
blood
on
the
pants.
in
fact,
agent
bigbee
went
through
step
by
step--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
that--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--dr.
blake
was
not
reading
his
own
report.
dr.
blake
performed
no
independent
analysis.
dr.
blake
was
reading
agent
bigbee's
report.
agent
bigbee
was
explaining
to
the
district
court
the
meaning
of
the
notations
that
he
included
in
his
report.
but
the...
but
the
dispute
goes
beyond
just
experts.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
report
at
issue
was
a
report
prepared
pretrial
by
agent
bigbee
when
he
did
the...
the
initial
enzyme
analysis.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
not
only
did
the
district
court
note--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
district
court
specifically
found
as
a
fact
that
the
blood
spill--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i
think
that
that
conclusion
implicitly
includes
a
finding
that
agent
bigbee
was...
was
credible
and
dr.
blake
was
not
credible.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
there
were
additional--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--dr.
blake's
background
is...
is
that
he
was
a
forensic
pathologist.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
he
was
often
employed
by
the
state.
he
had
a
history
of...
of
being
employed
by
the
state.
at
this
time,
he
was
not
a
state
agent,
your
honor.
he
was
not...
had
not
worked
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
on
this
case.
he
did
not
perform
the
autopsy.
he
did
not
view
the
body.
he
did
not
perform
the
enzyme
marker
study
in
this
case.
he
simply
came
in
and
reviewed
results
and
photographs
that
had
been
conducted
and
taken
by...
by
individuals
previously.
he
had
no
direct
responsibility
in
this
case
aside
from--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--he
was
not
a
credible
witness,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
agent
bigbee
specifically
testified
that
the
enzyme
was
there.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
he
specifically
testified
on
page
282
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
specifically
said,
that
doesn't
mean
it
wasn't
present.
he
also
pointed
out
glo
should
have
been
present--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--and
said
it
wasn't.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
agent
bigbee
specifically
testified
that
the
enzyme
was
present.
it
could
not
be
typed
to
any
degree
of
certainty.
so
he
simply
called
it
inconclusive
but
that
it
was
present.
if
it
had
not
been
present,
he
would
have
marked
n/a,
meaning
no
activity,
which
was
also
included
in
the
report
in
a
separate
location.
but
i
think
it
goes
beyond--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
specific
basis
identified
explicitly
in
the
opinion
was
that
special
agent
scott,
when
he
removed
the...
the
blue
jeans
from
the
hamper
in
donna
turner's
trailer,
saw
what
appeared
to
be
bloodstains
on
the
jeans.
that
blood
ultimately
ended
up
testing
as...
as
positive
for
blood
and,
in
fact,
carolyn
muncey's
blood
so
that...
so
that
the
stains
were
observed
when
they
were
removed
from
the
hamper.
he
also
noted
that
agent
bigbee
testified
when
he
received
the
blood
at
the...
the
fbi
laboratory,
there
was
no
evidence
of
contamination.
agent
bigbee
testified
to
the
fbi
protocols
and
said
that
if
there
had
been
any
evidence
of
contamination
or
spillage,
the
evidence
would
have
been
returned
without
testing.
so
he
looked
specifically
at
that.
he
also
looked
and
specifically
pointed
out
a
significant...
the
testimony
of
paulette
sutton,
who
indicated...
who
was
the
blood
spatter
expert.
she
indicated
that
some
of
the
bloodstains
were
mixed
with
mud,
and
to
her
that
indicated
that
there
had
not
been
some
accidental
spillage
in...
in
an
evidence
container,
that
the
mud
and
the
blood
would
have...
were...
were
combined
to
the
extent
that
they
would
have
to
get
on
the
jeans
at
or
near
the
same
time.
so
those...
those
things--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
evidence
is
undisputed
that
it
was
a
dry
day.
if
you
look
at
the
autopsy
report
that's
in...
that's
in
evidence
in...
in
the
trial
record,
it
specifically
says
that
it
was
drizzling
that
day,
that
the
temperature
was
between
80
and
90
degrees
and
it
was
drizzling.
mr.
house
showed
up
with
blood
all
over
his
jeans.
he
got
the
blood
somewhere.
i
don't...
nothing
is...
i
don't
think
it's
entirely
clear
that...
that
the
conditions
were
dry.
his...
his
jeans
were
clearly
muddy--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--and
it
showed
up.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i'm
not
sure
that...
that
it's
clear
where
mr.
house
got
the
mud
on
his
jeans.
he
was...
he
traveled
some
distance
from
the
site
of
the
body
and...
and
to
his
home.
he
could
have
gotten
muddy
en
route.
i...
i
can't
explain
how
he
got
the
blood
on
his
jeans.
i
know
he
showed
up
with
muddy
jeans.
he
got
mud
on
his
jeans
at
some
point,
and
those...
and
the
mud
and
the
blood
were...
were
intermingled.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
got
on
there
at
the
same
time.
i'm
also
not
sure
that
the
mud
that
paulette
sutton
saw
was...
was
created
by
a
combination
of
mud
and
water.
it
could
have
been
perspiration.
it
could
have
been
any
other
type
of...
of
fluid.
it
could
have
been
blood
creating
the
mud.
so
it's...
that
is...
that's
very
ambiguous,
and...
and
i
think
that
the
fact...
the
significance
of
the
testimony
is
that
it...
it
did
not
indicate
an
accidental
spillage
after
the
fact
of
the
blood
onto
the
jeans.
and
i
think
that
was...
that
was
the
point
that
the
district
court
took
from
that.
he
wasn't
trying
to...
to
recreate
the
exact
sequence
of
events
in
the
crime.
he
was
simply
trying
to
pinpoint
at
what
point
the
blood
spilled
because
there's
no
question
the
blood
spilled.
the...
the
photograph
shows
it
spilled.
the
photograph
shows
that
the...
that
the
tops
had
come
off.
but
the...
the
photograph
also
shows--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i
think
there
was
testimony
that...
that
the
appearance
of
it
seemed
to
be
inadequate.
there
was
no
specific
quantification
of
the
blood,
and...
and
no
one...
no
one
attempted
to
do
that.
it's
not
clear
whether
some
of
the
blood
leaked
out
of
the
container
and
maybe
wasn't
contained
within
it.
there
were...
there
were
pieces
of
gauze
that
had
blood
soaked
in
it.
there
was
also
a
dispute
about
the
size
of
the
vials.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
i
think
what's
important
is
the
point
of
the
spillage.
if...
if
the
blood
spilled
after
it
left
the
fbi
lab...
and
that
was
a
specific
finding
made
by
the
district
court,
and
that
finding
is
clearly
supported
by
the
record.
what
happened
to
the
blood,
where
it
spilled
after
the
fact...
and
we
know
that
it
did
spill...
really
is...
is
beside
the
point
because--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--well,
i
do
think
you're
wrong,
your
honor,
because
i...
i
think
that
if
you
look
in
the
record,
there
are
at
least
four
witnesses
who
indicated
that
they
saw
the
blood.
one
was
special
agent
scott.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
well,
your
honor,
the...
the
photographs
that
you
have
are
photographs
that
are
taken
after
portions
of
the
jeans
have
been
cut
out
and
sent
for
testing.
you're
not
seeing
everything
that...
that
the
agent
saw.
special
agent
scott
saw
what
he
believed
to
be
blood.
he
couldn't...
he
didn't
know
it
was
blood,
but...
but
he
suspected
it
was
blood.
he
identified
in...
in
the
habeas
proceeding
the
areas
that
he
believed
it
to
be
blood,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
blood.
jerry
morissey,
who
was
the
defense
serologist
and...
and,
incidentally,
just
to...
that
reminds
me
of...
of
a
comment
made
by
my
colleague
in
his
argument
about
defense
counsel's
deficiency
in
not...
in
not
hiring
a
serologic
expert.
he
had
a
serologic
expert.
jerry
morissey
testified,
was
a
serologist,
and
testified
that
he
received
the
jeans
after
the
fbi
tested
it.
he
was
unable
to
duplicate
the
result,
but
as
part
of
his
testimony,
he
said
that
he
observed
some
bloodstains,
what
he
thought
to
be
bloodstains,
around
the
fbi
cuttings,
and
he
attempted
to
do
additional
testing
on
those
bloodstains.
so
he
saw
the
stains.
agent
bigbee
testified
that
he
observed
the
stains.
he
didn't
say
that
some
were
big
or
some
were
small.
he
said
that
he
observed
them.
as
well,
paulette
sutton
in
the
federal
habeas
proceeding
said
that
she
saw
the
stains.
she
said
she
couldn't
tell
upon
observation
that
it
was
blood,
but
it
was
dark
and
she
suspected
it
was
blood.
it
was
suspicious.
so
we
have
at
least
four
witnesses
who
say
they
saw
this
blood.
this
wasn't
microscopic.
this
was
something
that...
that
witnesses...
and
incidentally,
paulette
sutton's
observation
was
borne
out
because
she
did
presumptive
testing.
so
the
things
that...
the
spots
that
she
suspected
were
blood
in
fact
turned
out
to
be
blood.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
i...
i
think
of
all
the
evidence
presented
below,
i
think
that
the
confession
evidence
is...
is
perhaps
the
least
reliable
in
terms
of...
of
the
schlup
analysis.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
the
jury
was
never
informed
of
muncey's
confession
because
the--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
fact
of
muncey's
confession
didn't
come
up
until
13-14
years
after
the
trial
had
already
been
concluded.
and...
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
district
court,
in...
in
examining
their
testimony,
found
what
was
significant
in
his--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--well,
that's
what
the
witness
testified
to,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
the
district
court
did
not
specifically
address
that
element
of
the
witnesses'
testimony.
the
court
found
that
it...
specifically
that
it
was
not
impressed
with
the
testimony
of
a
witness
who
waits.
and...
and
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
regardless
of
whether
the
witness
waited
or
not,
the
court
examined
the
credibility
of
the
testimony
and
found
that
it
wasn't
credible.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that
was
one
of
the
reasons,
but
the
primary
reason
that
the...
that
the
confession
itself
was
inconsistent
with
the
other
evidence,
and
that
was
what
the
court
specifically
pointed
to
in
his
opinion.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
there
were
several
disparities,
your
honor.
the
confession
indicates
that
there
was
apparently
an
extensive
argument
at
home.
the
testimony
of
the
daughter
both
at
trial
and
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
was
that
there
was
no
such
argument.
she
heard
no
argument.
and
the
court,
incidentally,
found
her
testimony
to
be
very
credible.
he
observed
her
demeanor
and...
and
found
her
testimony
to
be
credible.
so
that's
inconsistent.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that's
correct.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
the...
the
testimony
at
trial
was
ambiguous
about
the...
about
the
car.
the
witness
identified
two
separate
incidents.
she
heard
a
car
and
she
heard
someone
inquire
as
to
mr.
muncey's
whereabouts,
and
then
she
also
heard
an
individual
come
and
tell
her...
her
mother
that
her
father
had
been
in
a
wreck
down
by
the
creek
and
heard
her
mother
leave
sobbing.
those
are
two
distinct
incidents.
and
lora
muncey
testified
that
she
did
not
know
whether
she
had
gone
back
to
sleep.
she
never
could
identify
or...
or
define
the
specific
length
of
time
between
the
two.
but
logically
those
are
two
separate
incidents.
it
doesn't
make
sense
for
someone
to
come
and
ask
where
mr.
muncey
is
and
then
to
say,
well,
he's
down
by
the
creek.
he
just
had
a
wreck.
so
it...
it
seems
that
just
logically
those
are
two
separate
incidents,
and
there's
nothing
in
the...
in
the
testimony
to
indicate
that...
that
they're
same.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
no,
your
honor.
the--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
she
heard
a
car
and
someone
inquire
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
her
father,
and
she
heard
her
mother
answer.
and
then
there
was
a
period
of
time
where
she
said
she
wasn't
sure
whether
she
went
back
to
sleep
or
not,
and
then
she
heard
a
person
with
a
low
voice
come
in
and
inform
her
mother
that
she...
that...
that
her
father,
hubert
muncey,
jr.,
had
been
in
a
wreck
down
by
the
creek.
she
heard
her
mother
sob
and
leave
with
the
individual
who
had
relayed
that
information.
those
are
two
distinct
incidents.
but
beyond
that...
the...
the
court,
incidentally,
found
her
testimony
to
be
very
credible,
found
that
her
testimony
did
not
support
this...
this
theory
of
some
sort
of
confrontation
in
the
house.
in
addition,
the
court
also
heard
the
live
testimony
of
hubert
muncey,
jr.
himself,
explaining
his
whereabouts,
explaining...
and
actually
denying
ever
having
made
the
statement.
and...
and
the
court
balanced
that.
as
well,
dennis
wallace,
who
testified
at
the
evidentiary
hearing...
he
investigated
a
missing
person's
report.
he
was
in
the
home.
he
saw
no
evidence
of
any
sort
of
struggle
in
the
home.
so
all
of
these
things
balanced
against
this...
this
confession,
which
has
absolutely
no
corroborative
support
in
the
record,
the
court
found
that
the
testimony
simply
wasn't
credible.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
there
was
a...
a
wound
to
the
victim's
left
forehead.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
the
confession
was
that
mr.
muncey
hit
her
and
she
fell
and
hit
her
head.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
it...
it
could
be
consistent
with
the
confession.
it
was...
it
was
very
sketchy.
there...
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
two
pathologists
in
the
habeas
as
to
whether
or
not
that...
that
wound
could
have
been
sustained
by...
by
falling
and
hitting
her
head
on
the
table
and
actually
could
have
created
the...
the
damage
in...
in
the
brain.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
well,
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question
is
if
you
are
at
that
mental
state
where
you
are
saying
maybe
this
evidence
is
right,
maybe
that...
that
evidence
is
right,
maybe
i
can
go
one
way
or
another,
then
i
think
the
respondent
prevails
in
this
case--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i
think
it
goes
beyond
just
having
sufficient
evidence
to
convict,
your
honor.
i
think
you
also
look
at
these
credibility
determinations
and
you
look
at
the
probabilistic
result
of
a
reasonable
juror.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
the
district
court
heard
both
of
the...
both
of
the
sisters
regarding
the
confession.
the
district
court
heard
hubert
muncey,
jr.
regarding
the
alleged
confession.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
my
comment...
sorry.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
my
comment
on
the
dna
evidence
is
that
the
dna
evidence
did
nothing
more
than
confirm
what
the
jury
was...
already
knew
was
very
likely,
which
was
that
the
donor
of
the
semen
was
the
husband.
the
jury
at
trial
was
informed
that
the
husband...
and
it
went
through
several
pages.
in
the
joint
appendix,
it
goes
all
the
way
from
page
56
to
66
where
we're
exploring
that
the
semen
could
have
been
deposited
by
the
husband
or
by
mr.
house.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
there
was--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--one
of
three,
and...
and
that
was--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--it
was
at...
it
was
an
aggravating
circumstance
of
sentencing,
that...
that
the
murder
was
perpetrated
in
the...
in
the
attempt...
in...
in
the
perpetration
or
attempt
to
perpetrate
kidnapping
or
rape
or
attempted
rape.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
the
motive
is...
is
well
supported
by
the
circumstances.
and
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
prosecutor's
argument--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--no,
sir,
it
wasn't.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
there
was--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
prosecutor
argued
at
trial
on
the
motive
question,
why
else
would
someone
lure
a
woman
out
of
her
home
with
a
lie
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
her
night
clothes
and
take
her
out
into
the
woods,
if
not
to
have
some
sort
of--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
state
put
in
the
semen
evidence,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
the
state
put
in
the
semen
evidence
because
it
was...
it
was
not
inconsistent
with
mr.
house
and
that
there
was
other
evidence
in
the
record
that
was
not...
all
of
the...
all
this...
this
physical
evidence
was
consistent
with
mr.
house,
just
as
the
semen
was.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
you're
looking
at
how...
how
a
reasonable
juror
would
view
the
case
if
it
knew--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
if...
if
the...
if
a
reasonable
jury
knew
that
the
semen
belonged
to
mr....
belonged
to
mr.
muncey
and
not
mr.
house,
the
result
would
be
exactly
the
same
because
carolyn
muncey's
blood
was
all
over
mr.
house's
pants.
that
is
an
indisputable
fact.
and
all
of
this--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
i
disagree
that...
that
they
made
a
big
deal.
they
made
a
big
deal
of
the
kidnapping
at
the
sentencing
phase.
that
was...
that
was
of
significance.
the...
what
the
prosecutor
did--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
the...
the
sentencing
phase
argument
is
not
contained
in...
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
closing
argument
from
the
guilt
phase
is
contained
in...
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
it's
certainly
in
the...
in
the
transcripts
before
the
court.
what...
what
the
prosecutor
focused
on
at
sentencing
was...
was
the
kidnapping
and
also
was
the
malice
and...
and
i'm
sorry...
the...
specifically
the
kidnapping--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--at
the
sentencing
phase,
the
prosecutor
said
that
the
evidence
would
have
been
consistent
with
sexual
molestation,
i
think
was
the
word
that
he
used.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
