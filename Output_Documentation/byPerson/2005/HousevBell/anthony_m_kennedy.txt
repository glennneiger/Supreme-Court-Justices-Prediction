is

isn't
there
also
evidence
that
the

in

to
account
for
all
of
the

it

also,
it

me
if

justice
anthony

the
petitioner,
paul
gregory
house,
was
convicted
of
murder
in
a
tennessee
state
court
and
sentenced
to
death.
now,
some
20
years
after
the
crime,
he
seeks
access
to
federal
court
to
pursue
habeas-corpus
relief,
based
on
alleged
constitutional
defects
in
his
trial.
his
claims
are
procedurally
barred
under
tennessee
law.
as
a
general
rule,
that
bar
would
prevent
a
federal
habeas
court
from
hearing
them.
we
have
recognized
an
exception
to
that
general
rule.
the
court,
in
schlup
versus
delo,
decided
in
1995,
held
that
in
certain
exceptional
cases,
a
compelling
claim
of
actual
innocence
may
provide
a
gateway
for
federal
habeas
review,
even
if
those
claims
are
procedurally
defaulted.
the
standard
set
forth
in
schlup
requires
that
in
light
of
new
evidence
not
presented
at
trial,
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
no
reasonable
juror
would
have
found
the
petitioner
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
house
argues
he
falls
within
this
exception.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
tennessee
heard
evidence
regarding
house's
claim
and
held
that
he
had
not
satisfied
the
schlup
standard.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
6th
circuit,
sitting
en
banc,
affirmed
by
a
divided
vote.
we
now
reverse.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
complex.
the
trial
and
the
habeas
proceedings
have
left
a
lengthy
record.
in
brief,
the
evidence
at
trial
pointing
to
petitioner
house's
guilt
was
as
follows:
first,
tests
found
that
semen
bearing
traces
of
house's
blood
types
were
on
the
victim's
clothing.
in
addition,
blood
consistent
with
the
victim's
was
found
in
small
stains
on
house's
jeans.
house,
who
was
on
parole
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
falsely
informed
authorities
that
he
had
not
left
his
girlfriend's
home
on
the
night
of
the
crime.
in
fact,
he
had
left
the
home
and
had
returned
hot
and
short
of
breath,
missing
his
shirt
and
shoes.
house
was
spotted
the
following
day
near
where
the
victim's
body
was
found
just
up
the
road
from
the
victim's
home;
and
the
victim's
daughter,
then
ten
years
old,
recalled
hearing
a
deep
voice
call
out
to
her
mother,
the
victim,
on
the
night
of
the
crime,
and
petitioner
house
has
a
deep
voice.
despite
this
evidence,
three
revelations
lead
us
to
conclude,
although
the
issue
is
close,
that
more
likely
than
not,
no
reasonable
juror
apprised
of
the
full
record
would
find
house
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
first.
dna
testing
has
established
that
the
semen
found
on
the
victim
could
not
have
come
from
house;
it
came
instead
from
the
victim's
husband.
the
state
points
out
that
motive
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
we
think
the
evidence
nevertheless
is
significant.
from
beginning
to
end,
the
cases
about
who
committed
the
crime,
when
identity
is
in
question,
motive
is
key.
while
the
evidence
at
trial
suggested
a
sexual-assault
motive
for
the
crime,
a
jury
acting
without
that
assumption
would
find
it
necessary
to
establish
some
different
motive
or,
if
the
same
motive,
an
intent
far
more
speculative.
the
second
consideration
supporting
reasonable
doubt
relates
to
the
blood
found
on
house's
jeans.
although
house
does
not
dispute
at
this
stage
that
the
blood
is
the
victim's,
he
suggests
it
could
have
gotten
on
his
jeans
through
spillage
from
blood
samples
collected
during
the
victim's
autopsy.
although
the
jury
did
not
learn
of
these
facts,
significant
quantities
of
blood,
in
fact,
spilled
from
the
samples.
now,
the
opinion
discusses
at
great
length
the
possible
significance
of
this
evidentiary
disarray,
and
we
conclude
that
the
dispute
likely
would
have
prevented
reasonable
jurors
from
placing
significant
reliance
on
the
blood
evidence
finally.
in
the
habeas
proceedings,
house
presented
troubling
evidence
that
the
victim's
husband
and
not
house
could
have
been
the
murderer.
in
particular,
two
witnesses
testified
that
they
heard
the
husband
confess
to
the
crime;
another
witness
recalled
witnessing
a
fight
between
the
husband
and
the
victim
around
the
time
of
the
crime;
a
fourth
witness
claimed
the
husband
visited
her
the
day
after
the
crime
and
attempted
to
create
a
false
alibi;
and
other
witnesses
described
a
history
of
domestic
abuse.
this
is
not
a
case
of
conclusive
exoneration;
yet,
the
central
forensic
proof
connecting
house
to
the
crime
has
been
called
in
question,
and
house
has
put
forward
substantial
evidence
pointing
to
a
different
suspect.
accordingly,
we
conclude,
although
the
issue
again
is
close,
that
this
is
the
rare
case
where,
had
the
jury
heard
all
of
the
conflicting
evidence,
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
no
reasonable
juror
viewing
the
record
as
a
whole
would
lack
reasonable
doubt.
at
the
same
time,
we
reject
house's
claim
that
he
has
established
a
freestanding
innocence
claim
under
our
opinion
in
herrera
versus
collins,
decided
in
1993.
in
sum,
house
has
satisfied
the
gateway
standard
set
forth
in
the
schlup
decision.
he
may
proceed
on
remand
with
the
procedurally
defaulted
constitutional
claims.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded.
the
opinion
for
the
court
is
joined
by
justices
stevens,
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer;
the
chief
justice
has
written
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
in
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
join;
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
