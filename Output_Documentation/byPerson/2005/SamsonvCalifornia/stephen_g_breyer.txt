why--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why,
if
we're
going
to
catch
some
additional
people,
is
that
not
sufficient?
that
is,
why
is
it
unreasonable,
say,
not
for
law
professors,
but
business
school
professors,
management
consultants,
to
say,
"you
have
a
lot
of
prisoners
in
california,
hundreds
of
thousands...
i
don't
know,
maybe
more
than
100,000...
and
we'll
tell
the
legislature
that
they
can
cut
the
terms,
save
money,
release
them
early,
but
we
want
to
have
management
checks.
"
"and
the
management
checks
are,
you
might
be
searched
at
any
time.
"
"and
we
catch
a
few.
"
"and
that's
helpful.
"
now,
if
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--state
decides
that,
what's
unreasonable
about
it?
"they're"--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"#
letting
the
people
out
earlier
than
they
otherwise
would--
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--says
the
legislature.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
on
the
other
side?
the
other
side--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is,
you'd
rather
not
have
policemen
search
you,
but
your
alternative
is
going
to
be
in
jail.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
of
course,
that's
how
it
happens
when
he's
in
prison.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
reason
that
people,
i
think,
are
saying
that
is
because
they
have
a
lot
of
prisoners,
they're
trying
to
create
a
category
of
people
who
don't
have
to
stay
in
prison,
where
they
have
no
rights.
and
the
real
question
is,
can
california,
in
trying
to
create
this
interim
category,
reduce
the
fourth
amendment
right
in
the
way
you
describe?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
they
can't
do
it,
but
the
justification
is
not
that
there
is
something
bad
about
this
particular
individual
or
he's
in
some
kind
of
limbo.
the
reason
is
that
there's
a
policy
tending
towards
release,
which
california
has
decided
they
want
to
introduce
this
as
a
condition.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
so,
what...
and
the
question
is,
what's
unreasonable
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
do
you
achieve
by
this
system
that
you
have
that
you
couldn't
achieve
by
a
system
that
more
carefully
worked
out
the
rules
and
conditions
of
a
random
search?
i
mean,
rules,
so
that
you
avoid
the
totally
discretionary
element.
and
if
you
want
to
have
management
consultants,
as
i
was
imagining,
have
'em.
they're
not
just
going
to
tell
you,
"go
and
ask
anybody
to
search
anytime
he
wants.
"
they'll
have
a
system
worked
out.
so,
why
not
at
least
require
you
to
think
it
through
that
much?
and,
otherwise,
it
is
unreasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
reasonableness
here
would
be
unreasonable,
unless
there
are
some
checks.
we're
talking
about
suspicionless
searches.
and
you
could
have
checks.
but
what
about
saying...
why
is
it
reasonable
to
do
it
without
any
rule
based
controls
on
the
behavior
of
the
police?
that's
the
question.
