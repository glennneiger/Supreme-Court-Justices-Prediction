what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
do
you
make
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
was
going
to
say,
what
do
you
make
of
the
pragmatic
argument
that
seems
to
cut
all
of
your
objections?
the
pragmatic
argument
is
both
in
favor
of
complete
discretion
and
of
suspicionless
search,
that
the
in
terrorem
effect
of
knowing
that
these
searches
can
occur
at
any
moment,
in
fact,
discourages
recidivism.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
apart
from--
justice
david
h.
souter
--apart
from
the
lack
of
popularity
of
the
state's
view,
do--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
we
have...
do
we
have
any
empirical
evidence
that
bears
on
the
in
terrorem
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
realize
that.
but,
beyond
that,
do
we
have
any
empirical
evidence,
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
answer
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
don't
have
any
empirical
evidence,
one
way
or
the
other,
apart
from
the
fact
that
california
stands
out
in
its
system.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
know
it,
but
i've
said,
about
three
times,
that
i
want
to
get
beyond
the
peculiar
position
of
california
to
any
other
empirical
evidence
that
cuts
for
you
or
against
you.
and
i
take
it
there
really
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
the
officer
says,
"i'm
searching
to
see
whether
the
person
has
any
evidence
of
crime
on
him.
"
for
example,
whether
he
has
any
drugs
on
him.
law
enforcement
purpose,
supervisory,
i
suppose.
they
want
to
know
whether
their...
whether
their
parolees
are
committing
offenses.
and
yet,
that
reason
would
apply
to
everyone
virtually
all
the
time.
so,
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
limitation
at
all.
what...
am
i...
am
i
missing
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
does
the
limitation
work?
the
guy
is
on
1st
street,
and
an
officer
says,
you
know,
"i
recognize
this
person
is
a
parolee,
and
i
have
a
law
enforcement
objective.
"
"is
the
person
committing
a
crime?
"
"is
the...
is
the
person
a
recidivist?
"
"is
the
person
violating
parole?
"
so,
he
searches
him.
the
person
gets
to
2nd
street,
another
officer
does
the
same
thing.
three
hours
later,
a
third
officer
does
the
same
thing.
in
each
case,
it
seems
to
me,
their
justification
would
not
fall
afoul
of
the
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
harassment
standard.
it's
not
coordinated.
they
have
a...
both
a
parole
and
a
law
enforcement
objective.
why
is
there
any
limitation,
then,
on
the
right
to
search?
justice
david
h.
souter
uh
huh.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
no,
but
let's
get
behind
the
rhetoric.
is
there
any
reason
my
hypothetical
could
not,
in
fact,
turn
out
to
be
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
apart
from
the
unlikelihood
of
all
those
police
officers
out
there.
but,
leaving
that
aside,
is
there...
is
there
any
reason,
in
the
standard,
that
my
hypothetical
could
not
be
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
mean,
let's
assume
the
police
are
telling
the
truth,
and
the
judge
says,
"sure".
so,
there
is
no
limitation.
and
it
sounds
to
me,
then,
as
though
about
the
only
limitation
that
would
be
enforceable
would
be
the
limitation
against
harassment.
if
one
officer
did
it
every
15
minutes
to
the
same
person,
or
if
there
were
a
departmental
systematic
policy
saying,
you
know,
"get
so
and
so",
that
i
can
understand
as
being
a
limitation.
but
i
don't
see
any
other
limit.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
do
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
agree
that
there
is
not
any
practical
limitation,
other
than
the
harassment
limitation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe
it
is.
but
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
is
that,
in
practical
terms,
the
only
limitation?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume...
let's
assume
that
the
cavity
search
is
demanded
at
the
bus
station,
and
the
officer
says,
"we
know
that
drugs
get
transported
by
people
who
ingest
them
in
the
balloons,
and
they
get
on
buses
and
they
travel
back
and
forth
from
city
a
to
city
b..
"
any
reason
that
that
would
run
afoul
of
arbitrary
and
capricious?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
i'm
telling
you
is,
he's
at
a
bus
station.
the
facts
are
that
a
lot
of
people
who
travel
on
buses
are
drug
couriers.
this
person
is
a
parolee.
would
that
run
afoul
of
the...
of
any
arbitrary
and
capricious
limitation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
sure,
but
the
officer
says,
"all
right.
"
"i'm
taking
you
down
to
the
station
for
a
cavity
search.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're...
i'm
asking
you
to
be
the
finder
of
fact
for
me.
this
is
the
officer's
explanation.
this
is
the
factual...
set
of
factual
premises
on
which
he
acts.
has
he
violated
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
limitation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
thought
the
assumption
of
your
answer
to
my
question
a
moment
ago
was
that
there
was
no
such
limitation,
so
far
as
california
is
concerned.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
sure.
but
we...
the
manner,
in
this
case,
is,
they
take
him
down
to
the
station,
so
that
they're
not
going
through
this
in
the
middle
of
a
crowded
bus
terminal.
but
the
point
of
the
question
was,
any
parolee
at
a
bus
terminal
could
be
subjected
to
this
demand
for
search,
and
i
thought
your
answer
was,
yes,
he
could
be.
and
now,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
you're
saying,
"well,
there
may
be
some
limitation.
"
so,
which
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
what
interest
does
it
serve
not
to
have
some
rules,
manuals,
regulations
that
help
make
sure
it
really
is
random,
or
help
make
sure
it
isn't
harassing,
or
help
make
sure
that
it's
serving
the
very
ends
that
you
hope
to
serve
with
the
suspicionless
searches?
justice
david
h.
souter
do--
justice
david
h.
souter
--even
apart
from
the...
what...
the
lack
of
evidence
for
any
change
since
the
reyes
decision,
do
we
have
any
empirical
evidence,
perhaps
involving
a
control
group,
about
the
likelihood
of
the...
this
liberal
search
policy
in
reducing
recidivism?
