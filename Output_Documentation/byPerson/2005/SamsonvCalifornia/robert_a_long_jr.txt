mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
search
in
this
case
was
not
based
on
individualized
suspicion,
and
no
other
adequate
safeguards
limited
the
police
officer's
discretion
to
search
petitioner.
for
this
reason,
the
search,
which
would
not
be
permitted
by
virtually
any
other
state
or
by
the
federal
government,
was
unreasonable.
the
court
has
reaffirmed
many
times
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
permit
the
individual
officer
in
the
field
to
exercise
unconstrained
discretion
to
search.
the
court
has
said
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
primarily
directed
at
the
evil...
it
was
primarily
directed
at
the
evil
of
general
warrants
and
writs
of
assistance,
and
the
evil
of
general
warrants
and
writs
of
assistance
was
that
they
gave
individual
officers
blanket
authority
to
search
where
they
pleased
and
placed
the
liberty
of
every
man
in
the
hands
of
every
petty
officer.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
a
parolee
has
conditional
liberty.
but,
at
the
time
of
this
search,
mr.
samson
was
on
parole,
there
was
no
suspicion
of
any
wrongdoing--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--oh,
well,
the
court
held,
in
the
scott
case,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
apply
at
parole
revocation
hearings.
so,
if
there
is
an
unreasonable
search
of
a
parolee
that
violates
the
fourth
amendment,
the
evidence
could
not
be
admitted
at
a
criminal
trial,
but
it
could
be
admitted
at
a
parole
revocation--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
understand
your
question.
in
california,
justice
ginsburg,
a
nonviolent
drug
offense,
the
possession
of
a
small
amount
of
an
illegal
substance,
is
not
a
basis
for
revocation
of
parole.
it
is
not
possible
to
revoke
parole
in
california
for
this
offense.
so,
parole
revocation
would
not
have
been
a
possibility
here.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
this,
of
course,
was
a
police
officer,
not
a
parole
officer.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
but
if--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--all
right.
i
think
if
a
parole
officer
said,
"you
must
consent
to
this
search--
"
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--"#
this
particular
search"--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
"and,
if
you
don't,
i'll
revoke
your.
"
--i
mean,
the
consent
is
not,
in
this
case,
first.
i
mean,
california
has
said,
the
supreme
court
has
said,
parole,
in
the
parole
search
condition,
is
imposed
as
a
matter
of
law.
your
hypothetical
poses
a
question
of,
could
there
be
knowing
and
voluntary
consent
to
a
search
if
the
consequence
of
refusing
is
revocation
of
parole?
i
would
argue,
in
that
situation,
that
the
consequences
of
refusal
are
so
dire
that,
effectively,
the
parolee
would
have
no
real
choice
but
to
consent.
so,
it
would
be,
in
a
sense,
a
coerced
consent.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
mean--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
have
two
answers
to
that,
justice
scalia.
i
mean,
first,
in
california,
you
finish
your
prison
sentence,
and
then
parole
is
a
separate
period
that
happens.
the
california
supreme
court
said,
in
people
v.
guzman
and
other
cases,
parole
is
not
a
part
of
the
sentence--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--in
california.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
it's...
in
california,
every
inmate
gets
parole.
it's
a
matter
of
law.
it's
not
a
privilege...
in
morrissey
against
brewer.
the
court...
in
other
cases,
the
court
rejected
the
rights
privilege
distinction
anyway.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
in
section
3067.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
but
it
is...
it
is
also
a...
section
3000
of
the
california
penal
code
says
every
prisoner
gets
parole.
it
is
imposed
on
the
prisoner
as--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--a
matter
of
law.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
california
supreme
court
has
held,
in
people
v.
reyes,
and
in
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
that,
in
california,
parole
is
not
a
matter
of
choice,
it
is
imposed
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
it's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that
is
what
the
california
supreme
court
has
said.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
what
the
statutes
say
is--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that...
the
statutes
say
that
parole
is
a...
is
a
transitional
period,
and
that
every
inmate
should
undergo
a
period
of
parole.
but
coming
back
to
your
earlier
question,
the
court
has
said
that
the
condition
of
a
parolee
is
very
different
from
the
condition
of
a
prisoner.
the
court
said
that
in
morrissey
against
brewer.
and
the
court
said,
in
griffin,
as
to
probationers,
that
while
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
probationers...
and
so,
parolees,
too,
we
concede...
are
reduced,
there
are...
the
state
can
go
too
far.
and
if
the
state
exceeds--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
permissible
limits,
it's
a
violation.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
there
are
many
rights
that
are
sacrificed.
what
the
court
has
said
about
the
fourth
amendment
rights
is,
because
parolees
have
conditional
liberty,
they
will
have
a
reduced,
but
not
eliminated,
fourth
amendment
protection--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that
would
be--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that
would
be
different
in
several
respects,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
there
would
not
be
discretion.
you
wouldn't
have
the
individual
officer--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
i
want
to
be
clear,
we
are
not...
we're
arguing
there
is
a
broad
spectrum
of
searches
that
states
can
undertake
of
parolees,
and
i'm,
by
no
means,
arguing
today
that
all
of
them,
or
even
most
of
them,
are
unconstitutional.
this
is
a--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
you
know,
that
would
be
much
narrower,
because
it
would
simply
be
a
drug
test.
i
think
it
would
have
the
problems
of...
the
officer
would
have
complete
discretion.
if
it
were
like
the
california--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think,
because
that's
a
much
narrower
test,
that
that
could
pass
muster
if...
but
i
would
think
there
really
ought
to
be
some
guidance
to
the
officer.
i
think
our
ultimate
submission
today
is--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--this
is
so--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--if
it
were...
if
it
were
tied
to
the
crime
that
the
parolee
has
committed,
you
know,
that
would
give
it
some
limitation.
this
is
a
completely
unlimited
search,
for
anything,
any
crime.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
in
all--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
in--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
in
this
court's
suspicionless
search
cases,
you
can
have
a
random
test
where
you
draw
names
at
random.
there's
some
other
process
that
doesn't
leave
it
up
to
each
individual
officer
to
decide
who
gets
the
drug
test
or
which
car
to
stop
to
check
the
driver's
license
and
registration.
what
the
court
has
consistently
held
as
really
at
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
this
notion
of
the
individual
officer
in
the
field
has
complete
discretion
to
decide,
"do
i
search
this
person?
"
"do
i
not?
"
"what's
the
scope
of
the
search?
"
"what
do--
"
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--"#
i
search
for"?
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
think--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
it's
a
very
different
set
of
circumstances
if
we
have
a
parole
officer.
this
court
has
said,
at
least
twice,
in
griffin
and
in
scott,
that
a
parole
officer
has
a
different
function.
they
are
not
in
an
adversarial,
or
a
purely
adversarial,
relationship.
they
often
think
of
the
parolee
or
the
probationer
as
a
client.
they're
trying
to
see
that
the
person
succeeds.
in
some
sense,
the
parole
officer
fails
when
the
parolee
goes
back
to
prison.
the
parole...
the
parole
officer
can
act
on
their
entire
knowledge
and
experience
with
the
client,
or
the
parolee.
so,
all
of
that
makes
a
difference.
and
the
court
has
noted
that
several
times.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
the...
as
i
understand
the
court's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--holding--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--as
i
understand
the
court's
holding
in
hudson
against
palmer,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
in
a
prison
cell.
and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
way
this
court
has
analyzed
the
fourth
amendment
issues.
it's
a
different
situation.
it
is
conditional
liberty.
it's
the...
that
sort
of
active
grace
theory,
or
right,
privilege,
distinction,
or
greater
power
includes
the
lesser,
all
those
arguments
have
been
rejected,
in--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--morrissey
against
brewer,
and
gagnon--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--against
scarpelli.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
have
a
pragmatic
argument,
and
then
i
have
an
argument
just
based
on
the
fourth
amendment.
pragmatically,
no
other
state,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
and
not
the
federal
government,
authorizes
this
kind
of
search;
that
is,
blanket
suspicionless
discretionary
searches
by
police
officers.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
so--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the...
well,
the
empirical
evidence
is
that
all
the
other
states
don't
seem
to
be
having
a
harder
time--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--with
recidivism.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
the
california...
i
think
that's
a
pretty
powerful
demonstration,
but
we
do
have,
beyond
that,
empirically,
california
was
with
all
the
other
states
until
the
people
against
reyes
decision.
now
they've
moved
to
suspicionless
searches.
they
seem
to
have
about
the
same
rate
of
recidivism--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--as
they--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--did
before.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i...
i'm...
think
i'm
offering
you
evidence
that
counts
as
empirical
in
my
mind,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--apparently
it's
not--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
there...
we
have
a
footnote.
there
is
a
brief
submitted
by
a
stanford
law
professor,
and
we
have
at
least
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
there
is
some
social
science
research
that
suggests
that
this
more
intensive
supervision
is
really
not
effective,
if
you
look
at
broad
numbers.
i
mean,
i
think
you
will
catch
some
additional
people.
i
mean,
it
happened
in
this
case.
but
if
you
step
back
and
look
at
the
overall
effects,
it's
not...
it's
not
particularly
helpful--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--because--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--because,
justice
breyer,
it
has
to
be
a
balancing
analysis,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
mean,
the
other
side
is
a
search
condition
that
says
you
have...
you
could
be
searched
at
any
time,
any
place,
by
any
police
officer
for
evidence
of
any
crime,
is
a
breathtakingly
broad
invasion
of
privacy.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
but
he
has
come
out
of
prison.
the
state
has
seen
fit
to
release
him
on
parole
into
society.
he
has
conditional
liberty.
and
the
court--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it
is
a
very
serious
problem.
we
don't
want
to
minimize
it.
i
mean,
it
is
a
fact
that
many...
many
parolees...
and
this
is
true
especially
in
california...
end
up
being
returned
for
technical
violations,
like
not
showing
up
to
meetings
with
parole
officers.
some
of
the
offenses
are
not
as
serious
as
others.
but
it
is
a
very
serious
problem.
we
recognize
that.
but
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
the
gravity
of
the
problem
cannot
justify
any
means.
there
has
to
be
a
balancing
of
the
invasion
of
privacy
against
the
state's
need
to
undertake
this.
and
coming
back
to
my
second
answer
to
the
question
you
asked
several
minutes
ago,
justice
scalia,
i
mean,
ultimately
this
search
is
a...
it's
a
general
warrant.
it's
a
writ
of
assistance.
it's
limited
to
parolees,
but
if
the
court
is
going
to
stand
by
what
it
has
said
in
griffin
and
other
cases,
that
their
parolees
and
probationers
have
some
modicum
of
fourth
amendment
rights...
reduced,
we
recognize
that...
this
is...
this
is
the
core
of
what
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--framers
of--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
fourth
amendment
prohibited.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that
is
their
answer
to
my
argument,
and
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
"arbitrary,
capricious,
and
harassing.
"
that's
the
california
supreme
court's
standard.
so,
of
course,
they
get
to
define
it.
and
they
have
not
defined
it
the
way
this
court
perhaps
would
define
"arbitrary".
it's
not
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
harassing
if
it
has
a
permissible
law
enforcement
purpose.
so,
as
long
as
the
officer
says,
"well,
i
don't
have
any
reason
to
think
there's
evidence
of
any
crime
here,
but
that's
what
i'm
looking
for.
"
"perhaps
there's
evidence
of
crime--
"
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that's
enough.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
i
take
it
the
fourth
amendment
itself
would
prohibit
that
sort
of
thing.
but
it...
you
couldn't...
you
couldn't
justify
a
general
warrant
by
saying,
"well,
yes,
the
officer
can
search
anybody,
without
any
suspicion,
and
he
can
choose.
"
but
it...
you
know,
the
search
can't
happen
too
often,
or
it
can't
last
too
long.
that
would
not
be...
and
you...
and
you...
similarly,
it
would
not
be
an
answer
to
say,
"well,
as
long
as
he's
looking
for
evidence
of
crime.
"
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
mean,
my
argument
is
that
what
is
left
of
the
fourth
amendment
under
the
california
approach
is
not
the
core.
it's
the
far
periphery.
there
has
never
been
a
case...
and
we
were
able
to
find
over
a
hundred,
and
perhaps
over
200;
it
depends
on
how
you
count...
of
cases
where
parolees
or
probationers
have
said,
"you
know,
this
search
was
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
harassing.
"
it
is
always
rejected,
for
the
same
reason
it
was
in
this
case.
the
court
says,
"well"--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--it--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
it
cuts
in
the
direction
that
it
is
an
empty,
vacuous
standard.
it's
a
standard--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that's
always--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and...
but
it's...
it
had...
there
has
never
been
a
case
in
which
a
court
has
rejected
a
parolee
search
as
unreasonable
in
time,
place,
or
manner.
and
you
could--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--as--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--we
said--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--at...
we
found
over
a
hundred
cases
in
which
it's
been
challenged
in
the
california
courts.
and
it--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
mean,
if
you
think
about
it,
if
the
search
is,
say,
at
night,
the
argument
is
going
to
be...
well,
if
we
said
we'd
not...
"never
going
to
search
you
at
night.
"
then
you
would
commit
crimes
at
night.
we
had
a
very
extreme
case
in
our
brief
about
body
cavity
searches.
and
they
said,
"well,
that...
of
course,
that.
"
--you
know,
the
suggestion
was,
"of
course,
that
would
be
too
extreme.
"
but
you
could
see
an
argument
if
parolees
and
probationers
knew
that
that
was
off
limits,
that...
you
know,
that
would
become
a--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--no.
let--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--no.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
let
me
be--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
am
not
aware
of
any
actual
case.
we
posited
that.
we
said...
you
know,
because
you
don't
need
to
know
anything
about
the
parolee,
except
he's
on
parole,
and
you
can
search
for
evidence
of
any
crime.
you
don't
need
any
suspicion
that...
so,
you
could
have
somebody,
a
sort
of
white
collar
criminal,
or
you'd
check
someone
who's
written
a
bad
check.
and
if
you
say,
"well,
i
think
perhaps
you're
involved
in
drugs.
"
"maybe
you're
one
of
these
balloon
swallowers.
"
--you
don't
need
any
actual
reason
to
think
that's
happening,
you
can
simply
say,
"i
want
to
investigate
that".
and
the
way...
you
have
to
investigate
by
x
rays
or
something
else
quite
intrusive.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--they
might,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but
our
principal
submission,
justice
scalia...
i
mean,
if
california
said,
"we
have
a
terrible
problem
with
crime
in
california;
and,
therefore,
we're
authorizing
every
police
officer
to
search
every
person
anytime,
anywhere,
for
any
crime.
"
that
would
be,
i
would
submit,
the
clearest
sort
of
fourth
amendment
violation
you
could
imagine.
it
would
be
a
general
warrant
or
a
writ
of
assistance.
it
couldn't
possibly
be
justified
by
saying,
"well,
if
it
gets
too
extreme,
if
it
gets
into
body
cavity
searches,
we
won't
allow
it.
"
we
are
talking
about
parolees,
yes.
their
fourth
amendment
rights
are
reduced,
yes.
we
recognize
that.
but
saying
that
this
sort
of
absolutely
unguided
discretion--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--there's
no
sort
of--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--they--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
what's
unreasonable
about
it
is
that
it
goes
so
far
in
the
direction
of
eliminating
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
people
who
are
not
prisoners...
they
are...
they
have
conditional
liberty...
that
it
is
simply
not
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment.
and
on
the
empirical
side,
california
is
an
outlier.
all
the
other
states--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
the
federal
government--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i...
one
of
the
things
we
wanted
to
make...
i
think
there
are
many
things
that
states
can
do.
they
could
certainly--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--there's
the
possibility
of--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--there's
the
possibility
of
individual
determinations,
based
on
the
individual
circumstances.
if
you
went--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--category
by--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--right.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
this
could
be
much
narrower.
and,
in
my
view,
it
would
become
a
much
closer
constitutional
question
if
it
were
limited
to
certain
crimes
where
the
legislature
or
the
state
made
a
finding
that
there's
a
particular
need
to
have--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--suspicionless--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
perhaps
convicted
terrorists.
you
know,
that...
and
it...
that's
very
different
from
what
we
have
here,
because--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i...
you
know,
we...
i
think
you
would
have
to
see
the
facts
of
that
case,
but
if
they
made
a
finding
that,
"because
of
the
nature
of
drug
offenses,
we
need
suspicionless
searches
rather
than
simply
reasonable
suspicion,
and
we
need
police
officers,
not
parole
officers.
"
--and
there
could
be
other
regulations.
the
federal
regulations,
we
think,
are
a
model,
really.
they
have
lots
of
limitations
on--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
and
i...
i
think
they
can
have
tighter
controls,
your
honor.
they
can...
they
can
have...
they
could
have...
they
could
make
this
a
special
condition
of
parole--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--rather
than
a
general
condition--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--of
parole.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
mean--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--this
court
has
said,
generally,
that
what
the
court
has
found
to
be
reasonable
for
one
state
is
reasonable
for
all.
and
when
a
practice
is
not
well
established...
and
here,
it's
far
from
well
established;
california's
virtually
unique...
the
court
has
taken
that
into
account
for--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
they
might...
halfway
houses,
as
i
understand
it,
justice
ginsburg,
are
largely
now
a
thing
of
the
past.
but
if
the
idea
is
you
would
actually
be
in
a
custody
situation
at
night,
perhaps
in
lockdown,
then
perhaps
hudson
against
palmer
would
come
into
play--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--which--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
so,
your
hypothetical
is,
could
there
be
suspicionless
searches
by--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--police
officers--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--at
work?
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--it's
a...
it's
a
harder
case.
again,
our
bottom
line
is,
there
would
need
to
be
some
limitations
on
that
individual
officer's
discretion.
that's
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
in
answer
to
justice
alito's
question,
this
search
is
unconstitutional,
because
the
officer
was
completely
at
liberty...
he
had
complete
discretion
to
decide
whether
to
search.
and
it
would
not
be
acceptable
if
california
said,
"you
can
search
anybody
on
the
street.
"
if
the
answer
was,
"well,
it
wasn't
a
particularly
invasive
search.
"
granted,
parolees
have
far
less
fourth
amendment
rights
than
others,
but
this
is
so
much
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
is
what
the
framers
wrote
the
fourth
amendment
to
stop,
these
general
warrants
and
writs
of
assistance.
one--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--consent--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
and
we're
not
asking
you
to
look
into
the
mind
of
the
officer.
it's...
california's
system,
it's
quite
clear...
they
admitted
it
here...
leaves
it
up
to...
the
officer
can
have
any
reason
for
doing
the
search.
it's
arbitrary,
in
the
sense
this
court
would
use,
but
not
california.
on
consent,
very
quickly,
footnote
16
of
our
reply
brief,
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
repeatedly
that...
including
very
recently,
since
this
section
3067...
that
parole
is
not
a
matter
of
consent;
it
is
imposed
on
you.
this
is
a
question
of
state
law.
perhaps
this
court
would
read
the
state
law
differently.
but,
as
the
court
said
in
griffin,
the
state
supreme
court
is
the
last
word
on
the
questions
of
state
law.
as
to
abuses,
there
are
a
number.
one
that
i'll
just
mention,
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
that
it's
perfectly
okay...
if
the
officer
knows
somebody
in
the
house
is
on
parole
or
probation,
they
can
use
that
as
a
lever
to
go
in
and
search
to
try
to
find
evidence
about
somebody
else
who's
in
the
house.
that
is
permissible
under
the
california
standard.
but
the
bottom
line
here
is
that
this
type
of
search
regime
is
at
the
core
of
the
prohibition
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
what
the
framers
wrote
the
fourth
amendment
to
prohibit.
so,
if
parolees
have
any
fourth
amendment
rights,
other
than,
you
know,
an
essentially
useless
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
that's
never
going
to
work,
the
fourth
amendment
has
to
prohibit
this
search.
there
are
many
other
things
the
states
can
do.
they
have
many
options.
this
is
at
the
endpoint
on
the
spectrum.
thank
you.
