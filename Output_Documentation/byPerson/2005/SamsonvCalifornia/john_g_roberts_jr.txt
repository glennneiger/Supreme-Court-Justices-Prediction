chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
samson
versus
california.
mr.
long.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
long--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--their
condition
is
very
different,
in
a
broad
range
of
areas.
they...
you
give
up
first
amendment
rights.
for
example,
it's
typical
to
have
a
condition
of
parole
that
you
don't
consort
with
known
criminals
or
gang
members.
you...
often
it
says
you
must
refrain
from
alcohol.
sometimes
they
say
you
can't
go
near
particular
places,
if
they
think
that's
going
to
tempt
you
to
return
to
a
life
of
crime.
those
are
all
first
amendment
rights
that
are
sacrificed
while
you're
on
parole.
why
is
this
any
different?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
a
drug...
what
if
you're
convicted
of
a
drug
offense,
you're
on
parole,
and
one
of
the
conditions
is,
every
week
you
have
to
go
in
for
a
drug
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--do
you...
is
that
acceptable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
would
be
a
fourth
amendment
right
that
you
would
be
giving
up--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
you
would
otherwise
have
if
you
weren't
on
parole.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's...
i
mean,
the
point--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
justice
stevens's
question
highlights
the
point
that
you
criticize
about,
the
randomness
of
it
is
often
a
critical
element.
i
suppose
it
makes
much
more
sense
to
say
you're
subject
to
a
random
drug
test
than
that
you
have
to
come
in
at
a
scheduled
time,
when
you...
presumably,
you
could
refrain
from
using
drugs
prior
to
the
test.
and,
to
some
extent,
it's
the
same,
even
if
you're
not
talking
about
a
drug
test.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
search
is
only
going
to
be
effective
if
it's
not
announced
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--scheduled.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--california--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
california
supreme
court
said
that
the
fourth
amendment
applied
to
these
searches,
but
it
only
protected
in
a
limited
way,
along
the
same
lines
as
we
said
in
griffin.
and
the
standard
they
applied
was,
it
protected
against
arbitrary
or
harassing
or
capricious
searches--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--which
seems
to
go
to
your
argument,
which
is
centered
around
the
unbridled
discretion
of
the
officer.
and
the
california
supreme
court
is
saying
it's
not
unbridled.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--fine.
but
it
turns
out
he
stops
the
guy
every
hour
of
the
day,
then
he
has
a
pretty
strong
case
that
this
is
for
harassment,
and
it's
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--for
the
special
law
enforcement--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--need
that
accompanies
releasing
parolees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
your
point
was
that
this
is
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
they're
taking
away
all
of
the
protection
and
leaving
it
to
the
unbridled
discretion.
and
that
turns
out
to
be
not
the
case.
under
the
law
that
authorizes
the
procedure,
the
california
supreme
court
interpretation
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
provides
protection
against
harassment
or
arbitrary
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--capricious
searches.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
which
way
do
you
think
that
cuts?
there's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--never
been
a
case
of
a
harassing
search
of
a
parolee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
that's
what...
or
200
cases
in
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
niver,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that?
doesn't
that
kind
of
beg
the
question?
i
mean,
if
we
say
he's
got
the
normal
fourth
amendment
rights,
his...
i
mean,
the
expectation
of
privacy
analysis
seems
to
me
to
be
totally
circular.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
he
doesn't
have
an
expectation
of
privacy,
so
it's
not
protected.
well,
if
we
say
he
does
have
a...
if
we
say
it
is
protected,
then
he
does
have
an
expectation
of
privacy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
knights
involved
a
situation
where
reasonable
suspicion
was
required,
so
it
addressed
the
problem
that
mr.
long
has
of
unbridled
discretion.
you
still
had
to
have
an
articulable
reasonable
suspicion
with
respect
to
the
individual.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why...
and
why
was
his
expectation
of
privacy
severely
diminished?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
of
the
very
practice
that's
being
challenged
here
today,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
he
saw
something...
you...
he
signed
something
that
said,
"you're
subject
to
searches".
well,
that's
what
is
at
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's...
i
guess
i've
said
it
before,
he's...
it's
begging
the
question
to
say,
"you
can
do
this,
because
he
has
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy.
"
how
far
do
you
push
this?
can
you
have
parolees
come
in
and
take
a
lie
detector
test
every
week?
do
they
have...
do
they
have
diminished
expectation
with
respect
to
their
fifth
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
that
a
yes,
you
can
have
them--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
can.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--does
it
depend...
i
mean,
what
if
he's
on
parole
for
transporting
drugs
in
balloons
from
bus
stations?
does
that
make
a
difference
+/?
as
opposed
to,
he's
on
parole
for
tax
fraud.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
niver.
mr.
marcus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
have--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
decide--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--could
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--waive
your...
could
you
waive--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
eighth
amendment
rights?
you
know,
if
your
parole's
revoked,
you're
going
to
go
back
into
a
very
cruel
and
unusual
prison,
not
the
one
you
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
marcus.
mr.
long,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
