well--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it's
the
case--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
this
program
would
allow
some
searches
that
are...
that
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
but
that
this
particular
search
would
not?
how
closely
can
we
focus
just
on
what
happened
here,
or
do
we
have
to
consider
all
the...
all
the
types
of
searches
and
the
circumstances
of
searches
that
the
california
program
might
permit?
