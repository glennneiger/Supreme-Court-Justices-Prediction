justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeal
of
california,
1st
appellate
district.
california
law
provides
that
every
prisoner
eligible
for
release
on
state
parole,
“shall
agree
in
writing
to
be
subject
to
search
or
seizure
by
a
parole
officer
or
other
peace
officer
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night,
with
or
without
a
search
warrant
and
with
or
without
cause”.
the
california
court
of
appeal
determined
that
a
suspicionless
search
of
a
parolee
under
this
law
is
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
long
as
it
is
not
arbitrary,
capricious
or
harassing.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
of
appeal.
we
considered
a
similar
search
condition
in
united
states
versus
knight
in
2001.
there,
california
required
a
probationer
to,
“submit
his
person,
property,
place
of
residence,
vehicle,
personal
effects
to
search
any
time,
with
or
without
a
search
warrant,
warrant
of
arrest
or
reasonable
cause
by
any
probation
officer
or
law
enforcement
officer”.
knight’s
apartment
was
searched
based
upon
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminality
and
his
status
as
a
probationer.
consistent
with
our
general
fourth
amendment
approach,
we
balanced
the
degree
to
which
the
search
intruded
upon
his
privacy
interests
and
the
degree
to
which
it
was
needed
for
the
promotion
of
legitimate
governmental
interests.
we
determined
that
knight’s
probationary
status
and
his
assent
to
the
clearly
set
out
probation
search
condition
significantly
diminished
his
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
we
determined
that
the
state,
on
the
other
hand,
had
significant
interests
in
combating
recidivism
and
promoting
the
reintegration
of
probationers
into
society.
accordingly,
we
held
that
the
search
of
knight’s
apartment
was
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
because
the
search
at
issue
in
knight
was
predicated
on
both
reasonable
suspicion
and
probation
status,
we
did
not
reach
the
question
whether
the
search
would
have
been
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
had
it
been
solely
predicated
upon
the
condition
of
probation.
we
reach
that
question
today,
although
in
the
context
of
a
parolee
search.
on
the
continuum
of
state-imposed
punishments,
parolees
have
fewer
expectations
of
privacy
than
probationers,
because
parole
is
more
akin
to
imprisonment
than
probation
is
to
imprisonment.
in
light
of
samson’s
parole
status
and
the
unambiguous
terms
of
the
parole
search
condition
to
which
he
agreed,
we
conclude
that
he
has
a
severely
diminished
expectation
of
privacy.
california’s
interests,
on
the
other
hand,
are
substantial.
california
paroles
a
significant
number
of
prisoners,
and
that
population
has
an
extremely
high
recidivism
rate
that
demonstrates
the
need
for
intensive
supervision.
a
requirement
that
searches
be
based
on
individualized
suspicion
would
undermine
the
state’s
ability
to
effectively
supervise
parolees
and
protect
the
public
from
criminal
acts
by
re-offenders
that
would
have
both
incentive
and
opportunity
to
conceal
criminality
under
a
suspicion-based
system.
balancing
the
parolee’s
significantly
diminished
expectation
of
privacy
with
california’s
substantial
interests,
we
hold
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
a
police
officer
from
conducting
a
suspicionless
search
of
a
parolee.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
souter
and
breyer
join.
