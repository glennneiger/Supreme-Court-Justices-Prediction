mr.
ronald
e.
niver
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it...
may
it
please
the
court--
alarmed
by
the
state
rate
of
recidivism
and
revocation
of
the
more
than
100,000
parolees,
california
enacted
a
statute
which
authorized
the
search
of
a
parolee
based
solely
on
his
status
as
a
parolee.
we
submit
that
such
a
search
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
as
this
court
held
recently
in
united
states
versus
knights,
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
search
we
balance
the
state's
need
to
search
against
the
privacy
interest
affected.
here,
the
need
is
overwhelming,
and
the
privacy
interest
is
dramatically
reduced.
turning
first
to
petitioner's
expectation
of
privacy,
it
is
greatly
diminished.
even
if
it
exists,
it
is
far
less
than
that
enjoyed
by
the
average
law
abiding
citizen.
no
one
outside
the
confines
of
a
prison
has
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
than
a
parolee.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
that's
what
the--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--well,
this
court
spoke
to
that
in
knights
and
said,
unanimously
that
the...
in
knights,
it
was
a
probation
condition,
but
i
think
that
it...
obviously,
the
same
analysis
applies
here...
that
the
imposition
or
acceptance
of
a...
of
a
search
condition
by
a
parolee
or
a
probationer
results
in
the
severely
diminished
expectation
of
privacy
enjoyed
by
the
parolee
or
probationer.
and
this
court
said
that
unanimously
in
knights.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
the
threshold
question
was
whether
he
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
at
all,
or
to
the...
the
extent
of
that
expectation
of
privacy.
and
the
court,
in
knights,
before
it
discussed
the
balance,
had
to
identify
the
factors
in
the
balance.
in
terms
of
the
probationer's
interest
in
that
case,
by
virtue
of
the
search
condition,
this
court
said
that
his
interest
in...
his
expectation
of
privacy
was
severely
diminished,
and
left
open--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--because
of
the
parole's...
excuse
me...
the
probation
search
that
was
imposed
upon
him
by
virtue
of
the--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--well,
yes.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
with
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
rights,
if
they
are
not
in
custody,
then...
or
even
if
they
are...
i
don't
think
that
that
would
necessarily...
the...
any
expectation
of
privacy
would
preclude
the
imposition
of
a
lie
detector
test,
no.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
yes.
but
in
this
case,
the--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--well,
of
course,
that
would
not
be
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
it
would
be
a
different--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--that
failing...
well,
in
terms
of
the
lack
of
a
precedent
from
this
court,
you
know,
at
this
point
we
can
only
speculate,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
person
can
be
required
to
submit
to
a
drug
test
by
virtue
of
the
status
as
a
parolee
or
probationer,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
an
extravagant
step
to
say
that
they
could
be
required
to
submit
to
an--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--suspicionless
search?
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
where
we're
back
to--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--yes.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
if
he's
on
parole,
your
honor,
if
he's...
look,
this
applies
to
parolees
in
california
who
have
been
convicted
of
felonies,
served
time
in
prison,
and
have
been--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--released
on
parole.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
on
parole,
or
not
on--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--if
the
person
is
on
parole,
the
answer--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--oh--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--he's
no
longer
on
parole?
than
the
entire
balance
changes.
the
reduction
of
the
expectation
of
privacy--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--my
answer
to
that
is,
it
would
not
be
valid,
your
honor,
because
a
person,
having
served
his
time
on
parole,
the
state's
overwhelming
interest
in
supervision
has
ended.
the
state
has
determined
that
that
person,
having
successfully
completed
his
period
of
parole--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--yes,
but
this
is
not...
yes,
your
honor,
but
this
is
really
not
about
punishment,
this
is
about
supervision.
and
if
a
parolee
has
successfully
completed
this
parole,
has
been
discharged
from
parole,
then
the
balance--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--not...
a
person
who
is
no
longer
on
parole,
there
is
no
longer
the
overwhelming
state
interest
in
supervision.
the
balance
changes.
our
position
would
be
that
that
would
not
be
a
permissible
search.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
well,
that's...
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
the
ex
parolee,
no
longer
on
parole,
is
no
longer
in
custody
of
the...
of
the
california
department
of
corrections,
there
is
no
longer
an
overwhelming
need
to
supervise
the
person,
who,
having
successfully
completed
parole,
is
presumptively
not
the
threat
to
society
that
he
was
that
he...
when
he
was
a
parolee.
the
balance
changes,
and
such
a
condition...
that
is
to
say
a
suspicionless
search
of
an
ex
parolee...
i
think
would
offend
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
well,
we
have
disputed
petitioner's
position
that
this
is
a
search,
although
suspicionless,
that
it
is...
that
discretion
is
not
circumscribed
is
our
position.
and
it
is,
because--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--yes.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
in...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
in
practice,
the...
a
search...
a
parole
search
may
not
be
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
conducted
solely
for
the
purpose
of
harassing--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--no,
they
are
not
told
that
they
may
search
any
parolee,
your
honor.
rather,
they
are
told
that
the
search
must
be
to
rehabilitate,
reform,
or
have
some
other
law
enforcement
purpose.
and
they--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--it
does
apply...
it
is
a
limitation.
it
is
not
a
limitation
that
would
protect
the
expectation
of
privacy
of
a
nonparole--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--if
these
are,
as
i
understand
your
honor's
hypothetical,
three
independent
searches--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--to
the
extent
that
that
could
happen,
and
i
suppose
it
could,
the...
again,
the
limitation
is
that
it
be,
as
your
honor
states,
for
a
valid
law
enforcement
purpose,
and
it
would
require--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--there
is
no--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--well,
your
honor,
no,
there
is
no
reason,
but
it
would...
it
requires
more
than
testimony
by
the
officers.
if
the
officers
at...
each
testified
that
they
conducted
the
search,
they're...
also
requires
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
that
the
searches
were,
in
fact,
for
a
valid
law
enforcement
purpose.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
well,
the
limitation
is,
as
your
honor
states,
if
it's
a...
for
a
valid
law
enforcement
purpose
or
to
promote
rehabilitation
or--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--recommend--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--but--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--i...
well,
that
harassment
limitation
is
sufficient
to
protect
the
residuum
of
an
expectation--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--of--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--it
is
a...
but
it...
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
protection.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
i
think
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
search.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
there's
an--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--overarching
principle
here,
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
the
search
be
reasonable,
in
terms
of
manner
and
scope.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
that
applies
equally
to
a
suspicionless
search
as
it
would
to
a
search
based
on
individual
suspicion.
to
that
extent,
it's
really
not
an
issue
that
arises
from
the
fact
that
this
is
suspicionless.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
or
an--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--or
a
needlessly
intrusive
search,
as
has
been
just
described,
or--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
search.
again,
your
honor--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--it
would,
for
example,
if
it
were
done
in
public
view.
if
the
officer
didn't,
then--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--again,
the
office...
if
the
officer
did
it
under
those
circumstances,
it's
for
the
finder
of
fact
to
decide
whether
it
was
done
for
a
legitimate
purpose
or--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--if,
in
fact,
it
was
for
the
purpose
that
you
state,
a
legitimate
law
enforcement
purpose,
and
he
has
been
removed
from
public
view,
and
it's
reasonable,
in
terms
of
manner
and
intensity,
then
it
would
be
permissible.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
that
would
depend,
your
honor,
on
the
prison,
the
prison
regs,
the
state.
i
can't
answer
that
question--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--in--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--no,
there
is
a
limitation,
in
terms
of
manner
and
scope.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
that
if
the
search
is
a...
for
a
valid
law
enforcement
purpose,
and
it
is
reasonable
in
scope
and
manner,
then
it
is
a
permissible
parolee
search,
in
california.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
it
certainly
might,
your
honor.
and,
again,
that
would
be...
that...
an
additional
bit
of
evidence
to
present...
to
be
presented
to
the
suppression
court
to
determine
whether
the
scope
of
the
search
was
reasonable.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
it's
necessarily
determined
on
the...
any
search
has
to
be
decided...
the
reasonableness
of
any
search
has
to
be
decided
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
okay.
and
the
answer
is,
in
terms
of
the
competing
interests,
the
lowered
expectations--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--if
a
state
wishes
to
adopt
such
rules,
those
would...
may
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment.
the
question
is
not,
what
could
be
done?
the
question
is,
what
was
done?
the
question
is
whether
california's
rule,
which
permits
parolee
searches
that...
with
the...
absolute
prohibition
of
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
harassing
suits,
and
which
must
be
conducted
under
the
fourth
amendment,
in
terms...
reasonable,
in
terms
of
time,
place,
manner,
and
scope...
the
question
is
whether
that
system,
the
california
scheme,
is
constitutional
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and
here,
the
system
was
designed
to
address
an
overwhelming
problem
that
the
court,
this
court,
has
well
defined.
the...
over
100,000
parolees
are
on
the
street
at
any
given
time.
almost
90,000
of
them
will
be
revoked
in
any
given
period.
they...
the
california
parolees
require
intense
supervision.
the
statute,
3067,
was
enacted
to
permit
that
kind
of
intense
supervision.
and
the
protection
afforded
to
the
parolee,
in
terms
of
a
requirement
of
a
proper
purpose--
