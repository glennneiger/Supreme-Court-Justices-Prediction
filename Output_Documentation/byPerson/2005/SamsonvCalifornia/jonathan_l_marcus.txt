mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
concerned
about
the
threat
that
parolees
pose
to
public
safety,
the
california
legislature,
in
1996,
authorized
both
police
and
parole
officers
to
search
them
without
individualized
suspicion.
whether
evaluated
under
the
special
needs
doctrine
applied
in
griffin,
or
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
approach
applied
in
knights,
the
search
of
petitioner
in
this
case,
pursuant
to
his
search
condition,
was
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
no,
we
do
embrace
it.
we...
but
we
briefed--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--the--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--it--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--we--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--we--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--right.
it--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
primarily...
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first,
your
honor,
the
california
supreme
court
has
not
had
a
chance
to
interpret
3067(a),
you
know,
after
the
reyes
decision.
they
weren't
interpreting
it
there.
and
so,
they
haven't
had
a
chance
to
revisit
their
ruling
that,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
it's
not...
there's
no
consent
when
it
comes
to
a
parolee.
and
that's...
so,
we
thought
maybe
that
would
be
a
reason
this
court,
prudentially,
wouldn't
want
to
reach
that
issue.
and,
secondly,
the...
while
the
joint
appendix
contains
a
portion
of
the
agreement
that
the
petitioner
signed,
it
doesn't
contain
the
whole
content
of
the
agreement.
the
appellate
record
doesn't
contain
the
whole
content
of
the
agreement.
so,
we
didn't--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
i
think--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--we--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--right,
we
think
all--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--we
think
all
three
arguments
are
strong.
i
don't
think...
one
isn't
necessarily
stronger
than
the
other.
and...
but...
and
this
court...
but
if
the
court...
i
mean,
the
court
certainly,
at
a
minimum,
can
look
at
the
statutes
under
california
law,
and
can
certainly
conclude
from
the
statutes
that
if
a...
if
some...
if
an
inmate
doesn't
sign
the
papers,
he
stays
in
prison
until
his
sentence
basically
terminates.
and
then...
and
then,
at
that
point,
when
he's
released,
this...
another
provision,
section
3060.5,
kicks
in,
and
his
parole...
his
parole
is
revoked.
and
he
eventually
will...
he
ultimately
will
serve
his
whole
term
of
parole
in
prison,
so
that
the
court
can
see
by
the
statutes
that
it
is,
effectively,
a
choice,
statutorily,
that
he...
someone
who
does
not
want
to
be
on
parole
does
not
have...
does
not
have
to
sign
the
condition,
and
will
never
go
on
parole.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
i
think
it's
fairly
clear,
your
honor,
under...
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
if
you...
if
you
look
at
a
combination
of
section
3067(b),
and
then...
which--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--right.
and
then--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--and
if
you
look
at--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--3067(b),
and
then
you
also
look
at...
3067(a)
and
(b),
and
then
you
look
at
section
3060.5,
which
provides
for
revocation
if
the...
if
the
inmate
is...
or
the
parolee
is
unwilling
to--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--sign
the--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--agreement.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
you
know,
again,
if
you
think
that--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--there--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--there--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--there
undoubtedly
are
adverse
consequences
to
not
signing
the
agreement.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
but--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--but--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
the
test
would
be
whether
it's...
whether
it's
reasonably
the
consent...
what
they're
asking
you
to
agree
to
is
reasonably
related
to
the
purposes
of
punishment.
and,
in
this
case,
the...
you
know,
the
supervision
of
the
parolee,
rehabilitation,
protection
of
public
safety.
and
so,
we
think
the
consent
argument
works
very
well
here.
but,
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
also
address
our
arguments
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
special
needs.
faced
with
a
serious
recidivism
problem,
california
has
made
the
reasonable
judgment
that
subjecting
parolees
to
suspicionless
searches
is
necessary
to
protect
public
safety
and
to
promote
rehabilitation.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
but--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
i...
no,
i
mean,
i
think
typically
this
court
applies
a
very,
sort
of,
narrowly
tailored
approach
to
fourth
amendment
questions,
and
focuses
narrowly
on
the
context
in
which
the
search
was
conducted.
in
this
case,
for
example,
you
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
a
search
of
a
home
was
constitutional.
this...
i
mean,
the
question
here
is
whether
a
search
of
the
petitioner
on
a
public
street
was
constitutional.
and
the
court
does
typically
limit
its
fourth
amendment
cases
to
the
facts
presented.
so...
but,
at
the
same
time,
in
analyzing
that,
i
think
you
do
have
to
consider
what
the
fourth
amendment
standard
is.
and
we
believe
the
fourth
amendment
does
impose...
the
fourth
amendment
itself
imposes
restrictions
on
the
discretion
of
police
officers
and
parole
officers
that
are
meaningful,
that...
as
the
reyes
court
said,
there
are
restrictions
on
the
timing,
the
frequency,
the
duration,
and
the
oppressiveness
of
the
search.
so,
police
officers
and
parole
officers
are
on
notice
that
courts
will
review
suspicionless
searches
very
carefully.
they're
on
notice
that
there
are
limits
to
what
they
can
do.
and
they're--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--on
notice
that--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--if
a
search
is--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--if
there
were
no...
no,
we...
no,
we
think
there
are...
the
fourth
amendment
imposes
restrictions...
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions...
on
the
suspicionless
searches.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
and
so,
that--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--i...
that's
correct.
i
don't...
i
mean,
i--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--i
think
you
just--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--right.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
right.
and--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--i
think,
in
determining
that,
you
would...
in
determining
it
and
looking
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
you
would...
you
would
apply
a
fourth
amendment
standard
to
determine
whether
this
search
was
objectively
reasonable.
and
you
would
look
at
factors
like
the
time,
place,
frequency,
and
manner
to
determine
whether
a
search
was,
in
fact,
reasonable--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--and
objective--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--objective--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--that's
correct.
and
it's
to
see
whether
it's
objective...
whether
the
search
in
this
case
was
objectively
related
to
the
purposes
of
supervision,
to
protect
public
safety,
and
to
promote
rehabilitation.
that,
we
think,
is
the
test
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and
while
petitioner
points
out
that
there
are
a
hundred
cases
out
there
where
the
standard,
you
know,
hasn't
been
used
to
throw
out
a
search,
at
the
same
time,
he
hasn't
pointed
to
any
cases
where
a
prosecution
has
been
based
on
an
abusive
search
that
this
standard
has
been
too
toothless
to
throw
out.
and
we
think
that's
significant,
given
that
this
type
of
condition
has
been
in
place
for
over
20
years
for
probationers,
since
the
bravo
decision
in
1987.
and
the
parole
condition
has
been
in
place
since
1996,
when
the
legislature
authorized
this
and
made
a
considered
decision
to
switch
from
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard
to
a
suspicionless
standard
for
parolees.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
we
don't
have
this
program.
there
are...
i
mean,
district
courts
have
the
authority
to
impose
a
suspicionless
search
condition.
and
some
have.
i
think
the
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
here
is
that
this
is
a...
the
court
has
traditionally
given
a
lot
of
deference
to
states
in
dealing
with
convicted
felons
in
their
criminal
justice
system,
in
making
sentencing
determinations,
reasonable
sentencing
determinations,
as
this
court
emphasized
in
the
ewing
decision.
and
so,
california
clearly
has
a
big
problem
on
their
hands.
the
recidivism
rates
are
demonstrated,
they're
in
the
record.
the...
california
was
responding
to
those
high
recidivism
rates.
they
were
also
responding
to
some
high
profile
crimes
involving
parolees.
and
the...
and,
on
top
of
that,
we
do
have
a
brief
that's
submitted
by
21
states
who
say
that
they
do
need
this
authority
to
effectively
supervise
parolees.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
but--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
i...
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
if
the
studies
have
been...
statistics
have
been,
sort
of,
documented
up
to
this...
to
this
date,
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
draw
conclusions
from
those
statistics,
because,
of
course,
this
gives...
this
provision
gives
the
california
parole
and
police
officers
more
authority
to
conduct
searches;
and
so,
there's...
to
the
extent
it's
increasing
the
detection
of
crime,
and
so
more
people
are
actually
being,
you
know,
put
back
in
prison
on
a
parole
violation
or
a
criminal
violation,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
that
it's...
this
isn't,
you
know,
being
successful
in
reducing
recidivism,
because
there's--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--i
mean,
there's
that
side
to
it,
too.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
may
i
answer
the
question,
your
honor?
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
i
think,
you
know,
traditionally
this
court
has
been
very
deferential
to
state
decisions
on...
you
know,
on
efficacy,
on
whether
a
particular
program
is
going
to
be
efficacious...
i
mean,
cases
like
martinez
fuerte
and
the
sitz
decision
involving
checkpoints
for
drunk
driving...
in
a
court.
even
with,
you
know,
very
strong,
you
know,
low
efficacy
rates...
in,
you
know,
a
program
that's
showing
very
low
efficacy
rates,
the
court
said
that
these
are
judgment
that...
judgments
that
the
states
need
to
make,
and
they
ought
to
be
given
a
lot
of
deference,
even
if,
you
know,
their...
you
know,
the
numbers,
you
know,
of...
don't
show,
by
clear
and
convincing
proof,
that
the
problem
isn't
being
ameliorated.
