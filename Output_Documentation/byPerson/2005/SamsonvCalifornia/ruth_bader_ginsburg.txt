mr.
long--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with
respect
to
liberty,
as
it...
it's
not
disputed,
is
it,
that
your
client
could
have
had
his
parole
revoked
even
though
the
search
was
suspicionless?
so,
we're
talking
about
the
difference
between
revocation
of
parole,
on
the
one
hand,
and
a
separate
criminal
offense.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
evidence
seized
could
be
introduced,
could
be
a
basis
to
revoke
parole.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
the...
what
the...
the
consequence
here
is
whether--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he
will
have
his
parole
revoked--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--or
he
will
have
a
separate
criminal
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
relying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
the
difference
between...
you
said
"officer
in
the
field".
would
this
be
okay
if
it
had
been
his
parole
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
parole
officer
was
walking
along
the
street,
saw
this
guy,
and
said,
"i'm
going
to
search
you".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
if
it...
if
it...
if
it...
it
doesn't
go
to
the
suspicionless
character
of
the
search,
but
it
does
say
it
has
to
be
reasonable
in
time,
place,
or
manner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
maybe
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--officers
are
reasonable
in
time,
place--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--or
manner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
times
has
it
been
challenged--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
drug
offenders,
given
the
high
rate
of
recidivism?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
you
were
in
a
halfway
house,
and
the
state
says,
"we're
creating
a
status.
"
"one
is,
you're
a
prisoner.
"
"another
is,
you're
a
halfway
house.
"
"another
is,
on
your...
parole.
"
"but
we
want
to
subject
you
to
suspicionless
searches
at...
in
all
three
stages...
prison,
halfway
house,
parole.
"
could
they
do
it
for
the
halfway
house?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
person
goes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--out
to
work,
comes
back
at
the
end
of
the
day,
and
is
checked
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah,
while
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--while
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
person
who
is
in
this
semi
custody
state,
he's
going
to
work,
and,
while
he's
at
his
workplace,
the
police
officer
shows
up
and
says,
"i'm
going
to
pat
you
down,
and
then
i'm
going
to--
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"#
see
if
you
have
drugs.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
niver--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
are
there
manuals...
are
there
any...
here
is
the
cop
on
the
beat.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
sees
someone
that
he
knows
is
a
parolee.
is
there
any
instruction
that
he's
been
given
so
that
his
discretion
can
be
guided
instead
of
rudderless?
in
practice
in
california,
are
all--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
what
is
the
practice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
about
what
instruction,
what
training,
if
you
know,
are
officers
given?
or
are
they
given
no
training,
just
the
law
that
says,
"you
can
search
any
parolee"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious?
you
told
us
harassing
would
be
the
repeated
searches
by
the
same
officer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
all
this
is
on
a
case...
would
be
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
there
are
no
going
in
guides
for
the
officer
on
the
street.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
long
seemed
to
have...
tell
us
something
different
about
that.
it's...
they
had...
they
must
go
out.
he
seemed
to
say
they
didn't
have
the
choice
of
staying
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
really--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
really
isn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's...
this
is
not
like
you
sign
an
agreement
and
you're...
you
can
do
it
or
you
can
not
do
it.
i
mean,
this
is
a
real
hobson's
choice,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
can't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--negotiate,
"i
don't"--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--"#
want
this
part".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
recidivism
rate
gone
down
in
the
years
since
the
reyes
decision,
since
this
is
suspicionless
search,
as
opposed
to
reasonable
suspicion?
