paul

what
would
you
say
about
a
condition
that
you
must...
not
a
regular
drug
test...
you
just
have
to
submit
yourself
to
a
drug
test
whenever
a
police
officer
asks
you
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
valid?
that's
what
i
was
asking
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
question?
part
of
your
appeal
of
your
case
is,
you
talk
about
the
corporate
offender
or
tax
dodger,
something
like
that.
it
seems
quite
unreasonable,
i
agree
with
you.
but
what
if
you
defined
the
class
much
more
narrowly
and
limit
it
to
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
violent
crimes
of
a
very
serious
nature
and
so
forth,
and
said,
as
to
those,
they
can
have
the
totally
suspicionless
search?
would
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--be
possible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
wonder
whether--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whether
you
think
they
could
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
i'm--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
want
to
see
if
there
is
a
way
that
the
class
could
be
defined
narrowly,
because
i
want
to
ask
the
other
side
if
they
would
allow
the
search
for
any
ex
felon,
for
example.
you
could
write
it
in
a
way
that
seemed
obviously
too
broad.
but
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
a
narrower
class--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
you
think
would
be
acceptable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
you
were
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--terrorist,
for
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
limit
it
to
terrorists,
convicted
terrorists.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
the
offense
he
had
committed
was
tax
evasion
or
price
fixing
or
speeding?
would
the...
would
a
person
on
parole
for
any
one
of
those
offenses
have...
be
subject
to
the
same
risk
of
a
suspicionless
search?
and
would
it
be
justified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--applying
this
statute
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
price
fixer,
tax
evader,
speeder.
do
you
think
it's
justified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it's
to
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--applied
to
the
tax
offender
and
so
forth,
how
about
just
applying
it
to
all
ex
felons?
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
just
the
very
fact
that
there's...
they're
an
ex
felon.
and
let
the
person
know,
at
the
time
of
his
discharge
from
prison,
that,
"this
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
state
is
going
to
exact
from
you
as
punishment
for
your
crime.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
saying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he's
not
on
parole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
hypothesizing
a
case
in
which
the
law
will
destroy
the
expectation
of
privacy,
because
it
will
provide
that
all
ex
felons
are
subject
to
search.
so,
they
would
know,
the
same
as
a
parolee
now
knows,
he's
subject
to
search.
would
that
be
valid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
so
you
don't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--rely
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
fact
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
then
we're
not
relying
on
the
elimination
of
the
expectation
of
privacy,
because,
under
my
hypothetical
statute,
the
ex
felon
would
know
he's
subject
to
it.
so,
it
has
to
be
something
other
than
the
absence
of
an
expectation
of
privacy.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
have
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
following--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--up
on
justice--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--alito's
thought,
supposing
there
were
no
restrictions
whatsoever,
but
this
particular
search
didn't
seem
very
offensive.
would
you
still
defend
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
was
assumed
california--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--didn't
say
if
they
had
protection
against
harassment
and
so
forth.
suppose
they
just
said,
"cart
blanche,
you
can
search
any
parolee
at
any
time,
any
place.
"
and
then
you'd
ask
whether
this
search
was
reasonable.
would--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so,
it
would
uphold
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no
matter
now
unreasonable
the
california
statute
might
be
in
other
applications.
