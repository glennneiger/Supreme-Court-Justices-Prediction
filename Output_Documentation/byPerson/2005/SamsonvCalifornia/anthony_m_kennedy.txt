well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
suppose,
can
pursue
her
own
line
of
questioning,
but
let
me
ask
you
this,
because
i...
her
question
suggests
this,
to
me
at
least.
suppose
the
parole
officer
said,
"now,
look,
i'm
going
to
search
you.
"
"if
you
don't
consent,
then
i'm
going
to
revoke
your
parole.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i...
my
question
was
a
parole
officer,
and
i'll
get
to
police
officer
next.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
you
see
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--person
on
the
street,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
that
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
that
a
burglar
could
be
searched
for
burglar
tools--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
not
for
drugs?
and
the
drug
addict
can
be
searched
for
drugs,
and
not
burglar
tools?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
not
the
consent--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--not
the
consent
approach,
i
take
it.
i
didn't
get
an
opportunity
to
ask
the
counsel
who
argued
just
previously.
seemed
to
me
that
he
argued
consent
when
he
answered
justice
stevens's
question
about
the
tax
evader.
but
he
argued
the
overwhelming
practical
needs
when
he
argued
the
rest
of
the
case.
and
i
thought
i
saw
some
tension
in
the
argument
there.
and
i
take
it
the
government
does
not
embrace
the
consent
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--put
it
in
number--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
put
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
number
three?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
in
your
view,
if
the
consent
was
straightforward
in
the
documents,
would
that
be
the
strongest
argument
or
the
weakest
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
take
you'll
win
on
any--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--argument--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
can
take.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
government...
is
the
government
of
the
united
states
somewhat
behind
the
state
of
california?
it's
not
efficient
in...
as
efficient
as
california
in
supervising
its
parolees?
because
you
don't
have
this
rule.
