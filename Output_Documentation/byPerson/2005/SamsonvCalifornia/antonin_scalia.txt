justice
antonin
scalia
why
are
they
dire?
i
mean,
he's
just
back
in
the
situation
he
would
have
been
in,
did
he
not
comply
with
the
conditions
of
his
parole.
i
don't
see
that
that's
dire.
he
has
a
choice.
he
can
stay
in
prison
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
suffer
the
reduction
of
privacy
there,
which
is
much,
much
greater
than
being
subjected
to...
i
mean,
he...
he
cannot
even
go
to
the
toilet
in
privacy.
or
he
can
go
out
on
parole,
subject
to
the
condition
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--be
searched.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
it's
also
clear
from
the
california
statute
that
it
is
not
a
right,
that
it's
a
privilege,
that
you
get
the
privilege
of
parole
in
exchange...
in
exchange
for
agreeing
to
the
conditions,
one
of
which
is
that
you
can
be
searched.
justice
antonin
scalia
california
statute
says
it's
a
privilege,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--prisoner...
oh,
i
thought
that
he
can
turn
it
down,
and
that
some
prisoners
do,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
they
decide
that
they
don't
want
to
be
subjected
to
searches.
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
and
you
mean
people
are
put
out
on
the
street
when...
kicking
and
screaming
when
they
say,
"no,
i
want
to
stay
in
jail.
"
"i
don't
want
to
be--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
"#
searched.
"
"i
would
rather
stay
in
jail?
"
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
are
dragged
out--
justice
antonin
scalia
--into
the
street.
is
that
what
happens?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
he's
in
prison,
is
there
any
problem
about
the
prison
guards
intruding
upon
his
privacy,
willy
nilly,
whenever
they
choose?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
walking--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
his
cell,
which
is
always
opened,
and
checking
in
on
him
to
see
what's...
what
he's
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
he's
better
off
on
parole
than...
well,
at
least
no
worse
off
on
parole
than
he
would
be
when
he
was
in
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
are--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
me.
no,
go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is
a
breathtakingly
high
probability
that
he
is
committing
a
crime.
the
statistics
cited
in
the
government's
brief
say
that
in
an
april
2001
report
prepared
by
the
california
criminal
justice
statistics
center,
68
percent
of
adult
parolees
are
returned
to
prison...
68
percent;
55
percent,
for
a
parole
violation;
and
13
percent
for
the
commission
of
a
new
felony
offense.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
a
breathtaking
statistic
like
that
may
call
for
breathtaking--
justice
antonin
scalia
--measures
to
try
to
police
the
matter
closely.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
there
was
a
case
in
which,
without
any
special
reason,
they
did--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
cavity--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
california
supreme
court
may...
might
well
hold
that
it's
arbitrary
to
conduct
such
an
extreme
search
as
a
body
cavity
search,
or
to...
i
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
decide
to
search
the
person
when
he's
in
the
men's
room
or
something.
i
mean,
there
are--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
are
a
lot
of
limitations
that
the
california
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
put
on
it,
within
the
context
of
harassment
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
long,
is
it...
is
it
fair
to
compare
california
to
other
states?
the
assumption
would
have
to
be
that
other
states
grant
parole
as
liberally
as
california
does.
maybe
california
has
made
the
decision,
"we
have
too
many
people
in
prison.
"
"we're
going
to
let
a
lot
of
them
out,
but
we're
going
to
keep
them
on
a
very
tight
leash.
"
why
shouldn't
it
be
able
to
do
that
+/?
to
have
tighter
controls,
but
let
out
many
more
people
on
parole,
which
is...
which
is
exactly
what
i
think
they're
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
my
only--
justice
antonin
scalia
--point
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
fact
that
other
states
aren't
as
tight
doesn't
prove
anything,
because
other
states--
justice
antonin
scalia
--may
not
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--be
trying
to
do
the
same
thing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
empty
their
prisons--
justice
antonin
scalia
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
right?
i
mean,
even
in
prison,
i...
what...
i'm
not
sure
you
could
even
do
that
if
they
were
still
in
prison.
can
you
subject
people
in
prison--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
no,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
chief
justice
was
trying
to
get
out
of
the
fourth
amendment
into
the
fifth.
justice
antonin
scalia
most--
justice
antonin
scalia
--most
states--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
let
felons
vote.
i
mean,
that's
a
punishment
that
they
impose
after
they're
out
of
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principal
difference,
mr.
niver,
is
that
when
he's
on
parole,
it's
in
lieu
of
being
in
jail.
if
that's
not
the
difference,
you
don't
persuade
me.
he
has
voluntarily
accepted
the
parole
in
exchange
for
his
getting
out
of
jail.
and
he'd
be
in
worse
condition
if
he
were
in
jail.
that's
what,
seems
to
me,
makes
the
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
that
maybe
cavity
searches
would
not...
would
not
be
allowed
without
some
special
reason
for
them.
and
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be
harassment.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
you
couldn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
couldn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--conduct
cavity
searches
without
some
special
reason,
even
in
prison.
wouldn't
that
be...
isn't
there
some
remnant
of
a
fourth
amendment
right
in
prison
that
you
cannot
subject,
you
know,
the
whole
cellblock
to
cavity
searches?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
he
said
he
was
unaware
of
anybody
who
was
dragged
out
kicking
and
screaming,
if
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--recall
his
answer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
asking
you,
i
think,
justice
alito's
question,
"do
we
have
to
get
into
that?
"
so
long
as
this
one's
okay,
why
do...
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
whether
there
might
be
some
other
ones
that
aren't
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
normally
don't
look
into
the
mind
of
the
officer
to
decide
whether
his
action
was
okay
or
not.
