justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say...
so
now
it's
essentially
redundant.
now
that
1331
has
no
jurisdictional
amount,
no
amount
in
controversy,
the
jurisdictional
provision
in
title
vii
is
just
going
over
the
same
territory.
it
doesn't
add
or
detract.
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
not
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
which
is
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
you
call
this?
would
you
call
15
or
more
employees
an
element
of
your
claim
that
you
must
prove?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
there
could
be
an
affirmative
defense
and
you're
not
claiming
the
latter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're...
you're
accepting
that
it
is
your
burden
rather
than
the
employer's
to
show
that
the
employer
had
fewer
than
15
employees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it...
you...
you
told
us
of
your
extensive
experience.
how
does
the
numerosity
requirement
usually
come
up?
you've
accepted
that
it's
an
element
of
your
claim
rather
than
an
affirmative
defense
the
defendant
must
plead
and
prove.
so
how
does
it
ordinarily
come
up?
does
it...
because
defendant
answers
and
asserts
that
it
has
fewer
than
15
employees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
joseffer,
maybe
you
can
raise
the
podium
a
bit
so
the
microphone
works
better.
the
other
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
about
the
eeoc
having
typed
the
question
jurisdictional
for
administrative
processing
purposes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
question
was
whether
the
truck
drivers
counted
as
employees
because
if
they
did,
they'd
have
enough?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no...
there
was
no
allegation
that
the
plaintiff
was
employed
by
your
client?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
the
complaint
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
it,
in
fact,
come
up
in
that
posture
in
the
case?
it
has
already
been
mentioned
that
the
word
jurisdiction
has
many,
too
many
uses.
did
it...
did
the
question
come
up
in
the
indian
tribe
cases
as
it
did
here
after
the
case
was
fully
tried
and
after
there
was
a
jury
verdict
for
the
plaintiff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when...
if...
if
it's
brought
up
promptly,
it
really
doesn't
matter,
does
it,
whether
you
label
it
12(b)(1)
jurisdiction
or
12(b)(6),
failure
to
state
a
claim?
it
goes
out
either
way.
when
it
is
consequential
is
when
you
bring
it
up,
as
you
did
here,
after
you
lose
on...
at
the
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
go
back
to
zipes?
in
zipes,
the
court
was
faced
with
the...
the
word
jurisdictional
had
been
appended
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
that
was
true
of
the
way
the
eeoc
spoke
of
the
rigid
time
limit,
that
it
was
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
and
then
the
court
explained
in
zipes
that
a
strict
time
line
doesn't
mean
that
it's
jurisdictional.
you
can
have
a
rule
that's
rigid,
but
it
doesn't
determine
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
that's
what
zipes
tried
to
explain.
the
court
in
zipes
was
faced
with
a
number
of
cases
that
had
used
that
term
to
describe
the
time
in
which
you
must
bring
the
action,
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
now
we
know
it's...
eeoc
has
changed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why...
now
that
we
do
have
zipes,
why
should
the
number
of
employees
be
treated
any
differently
than
that
rigid
time
line
in...
in
zipes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
a
pendant
jurisdiction
case.
wasn't
aldinger--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
you
just
used
an
interesting
word
because
there
are
litigants
who
can
claim
complete
immunity
from
liability,
but
that
immunity,
whether
it's
absolute
or
qualified,
doesn't
go
to
the
court's
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it
has
to
be
raised
in
those
cases
as
a
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
leave
it
to
the
states
that
often
do
cover
smaller
shops.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
certainly
matters
for
plaintiffs
in
this
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
certainly
matters
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view
too.
in
many
of
these
cases,
it's
not
clear
whether
the
number
15
has
been...
as
in
this
case,
you
have
delivery
drivers.
you
have
owners
whose
wives
are
employed
in
the
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
from
the...
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
defendant
who
thinks
i'm
going
to
fight
this
case
on
the
merits,
but
if
i
lose,
i
still
have
this
ace
up
my
sleeve.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
sounds
like
a
good
reason
why
a
court
should
think
long
and
hard
about
categorizing
this
as
a
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
would
be
simultaneous.
the
jury...
the
jury
would
have
that
question.
didn't
i
understand
the
attorney
for
the
united
states
to
say
this
is
typical
of
what
juries
decide,
was
this
person
an
independent
contractor
or
an
employee?
justice
ginsburg
justice

the

no.
04-944,
arbaugh
versus
y
&
h
corporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
distinction
between
sometimes
confused
concepts,
federal-court
subject-matter
jurisdiction
and
the
essential
ingredients
of
a
federal
claim
for
relief.
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
makes
it
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
discriminate,
among
other
grounds,
on
the
basis
of
sex.
to
spare
very
small
businesses
from
liability,
congress
confined
the
definition
of
“employer”
to
those
having
15
or
more
employees.
the
question
presented:
does
this
numerical
qualification
affect
federal-court
subject-matter
jurisdiction
or
instead
delineate
a
substantive
ingredient
of
a
title
vii
claim
for
relief?
the
question
arises
in
this
context.
jennifer
arbaugh
brought
a
title
vii
action
in
federal
court
against
her
former
employer,
y
&
h
corporation,
charging
sexual
harassment.
a
jury
trial
yielded
a
$40,000
verdict
for
arbaugh.
two
weeks
after
the
trial
court
entered
judgment
on
the
jury’s
verdict,
y
&
h
moved
to
dismiss
the
entire
action
for
want
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
for
the
first
time
in
the
litigation,
y
&
h
asserted
that
it
had
fewer
than
15
employees
and,
therefore,
was
not
amenable
to
suit
under
title
vii.
a
trial
judge
found
it
a
close
question,
but
determined
that
y
&
h’s
employees
numbered
below
15.
she
thought
it
unfair
and
a
waste
of
judicial
resource
to
dismiss
a
fully
tried
suit.
nevertheless,
she
considered
herself
bound
to
do
so,
because
she
believed
that
the
15-or-more-employee
requirement
was
jurisdictional.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
5th
circuit
affirmed
the
dismissal.
we
reject
the
lower
court’s
categorization
of
the
employee-numerosity
requirement.
if
congress
clearly
provides
that
a
threshold
limitation
on
a
statute
scope
shall
count
as
jurisdictional,
that
designation
will
control,
and
courts
and
litigants
will
not
be
left
to
wrestle
with
the
issue.
but
when
congress
does
not
write
a
statutory
limitation
on
coverage
as
jurisdictional,
courts
should
treat
the
restriction
as
nonjurisdictional.
applying
that
bright
line
to
this
case,
we
hold
that
the
threshold
number
of
employees
for
application
of
title
vii
is
an
element
of
plaintiff’s
claim
for
relief,
not
a
jurisdictional
matter.
title
vii
defines
the
term
“employer”
in
a
provision
that
does
not
speak
in
jurisdictional
terms,
nor
does
that
definitional
provision
reference
title
vii’s
own
jurisdictional
prescription,
or
28
u.s.c
§1331,
which
gives
federal
courts
subject-matter
jurisdiction
over
all
civil
actions
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
including
title
vii.
because
the
employee-numerosity
requirement
as
we
hold
today
relates
to
the
substantive
adequacy
of
arbaugh’s
title
vii
claim,
y
&
h
could
not
raise
the
issue
defensively
after
it
had
failed
to
assert
any
objection
on
this
ground
prior
to
the
close
of
trial
on
the
merits.
the
decision
reversing
the
5th
circuit
judgment
is
unanimous;
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
