mr.
brett
john
prendergast
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
i
have
to
start
off
by
disagreeing
with
my
learned
colleagues
on
at
least
three
areas.
first
of
all,
mr.
schwartz
indicated
that
the
plaintiff
pled
that
the
defendant
y
&
h
was
an
employer
in
this
matter.
that
is
inaccurate.
what
the
defendant
actually
pled
and
which
became
the
subject
of
the
subsequent
post
trial
motions
was
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction,
and
when
the
matter
of
the
number
of
employees
was
raised,
that
was
the
pleading...
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
plaintiff
raised
to
say
this
issue
has
been
waived.
there
was
no
specific
pleading
in
the
complaint
that
said
that
y
&
h
qualified
for
the
definition
of
an
employer
under
title
vii.
there
was
no
pleading
that
y
&
h
had
15
or
more
employees
for
the
20
or
more
weeks
that
were
necessary.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
there
was
an
allegation,
your
honor,
that
the
plaintiff
was
employed
by
the
company,
but
there
was
no
allegation
that
y
&
h
was
an
employer
as
the
term
is
defined
in
title
vii.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
i
don't
recall,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
the
word
employer
was
used.
i
think
it
was
clearly
stated
that...
and...
and
there's
no
doubt
ms.
arbaugh
was,
in
fact,
employed
by
y
&
h.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
i'm...
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
in
the
record,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
there
was
an
allegation,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--right.
and...
and
naturally,
though,
your
honor,
that
was
denied.
the...
the
admission
that
the
plaintiff
relied
upon
in
the
post
trial
motions
was
the
allegation
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
under
title
vii,
under
the
relevant
provision.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
that
was
admitted.
the
jurisdiction
was
admitted,
and...
and
in
the
post
trial
motions,
that
was
the
issue
that
the
plaintiff
hung
their
hat
on
to
come
back
and
say
this
issue
is...
is
established
and
stipulated.
there
was
clearly
no
admission
that
the--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--well,
there
was...
but--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--justice
breyer,
if
an
employer...
and...
and
i
disagree
with
the
position
that
it's...
i...
i
think
it
is
an
element
of
the
merits
in
addition
to
being
an
element
of
jurisdiction.
but
if
a
plaintiff
has
that
as
part
of
their
burden
of
proof,
then
the
plaintiff
naturally
has
to
introduce
evidence--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--no,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--and
which
we
maintain
that
it
is
jurisdictional.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
there
is,
in
fact,
any
waiver
because--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--no,
your
honor,
we
didn't
raise
it
in
the
appeal,
the
reason
being
that
while
the
matter
was
still
pending
in
the
trial
court,
in
addition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
jurisdiction,
which
was
granted,
there
was
a
motion
of
renewed
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
which
included
the
plaintiff's
failure
to
maintain
their
burden
of
proof.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
that
was
dismissed
as
moot
because
of
the
jurisdictional
issue,
your
honor.
so
whether
or
not
that
is
raised
or
not...
i
agree
with
you.
it's
not
before
this
court
today,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
that
can
be
decided
by
this
court
either.
it's
a
matter,
if
this
court
should
decide
that
it
is
a
merits
issue,
that
goes
back
to
the
trial
court
on
remand.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
i
think
the
other
aspects...
and
clearly,
this
has
not
been
the
subject
of
great
research...
would
be
the
other
ones
that
designate
the
scope
or
the
coverage
of
the
act,
for
example,
especially
as
it
relates
to
employer.
at
least
three
circuit...
and
in
addition
to
excluding
small
companies
as
employers,
the
act
also
includes
as...
excludes
as
employers
private
membership
clubs,
the
government,
the
united
states,
agencies
of
the
united
states,
wholly
owned
corporations
of
the
united
states,
and
also
indian
tribes.
at
least
three
circuit
courts
have
held
that
indian
tribes
and
their
status
is
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that's
the
fifth
circuit
in
thomas
v.
choctaw,
the
tenth
circuit
in
duke
v.
absentee
shawnee
tribe,
and
the
ninth
circuit
in--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
i
don't
think
they
got
into
that
matter,
justice
stevens.
instead,
what
they
simply
decided
was
whether
or
not
the...
the
employer
was
an
indian
tribe.
there
was
a
question
concerning
some
of
the
structures
and
just
the
business
organizations
that
the
indian
tribes
were
using
and--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--yes,
your
honor,
because
the...
the
cases
did
clearly
hold
that
the
matter
of...
as
an
indian
tribe
was
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
as
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
it
is
completely
established
law
that
that
may
not
be
waived.
it
may
be
raised
at
any
time.
so--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--no,
your
honor.
those
were
cases
where
there
were
motions
to
dismiss
based
upon
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
i...
i
think
the
effect
could
be
different
when
you
raise
it.
i
think
there
can
also
be
a
difference
in
effect
in
how
it
will
be
treated,
even
if
it
was
promptly
raised.
i
think,
for
example,
on
a
12(b)(1)
motion,
i
don't
believe
the...
the
court
is
obligated
to
accept
all
the
plaintiff's
pleadings.
it's
allowed
to
look
outside
the
pleadings
to
actually
determine
the
jurisdiction.
whereas,
in
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
if
the
plaintiff
says
it's
an
indian
tribe,
it's
an
indian
tribe.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
yes.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
no,
your
honor.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
i
think
the
distinction
is
similar
to
an
aldinger/kenosha
type
distinction.
and
i
think
the
question
goes
back
to
it
requires
an
interpretation
of
whether
or
not
congress
wanted
to
give
the
lower
federal
courts
the
type
of
jurisdiction
being
discussed.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
and...
and--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--and...
and--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--well,
how--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--how...
how
do
you
know--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--justice
scalia,
the
way
you
know
is
because
you
look
at
the
logical
deductions
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
congressional
statutes,
as
this
court
suggested
in
aldinger.
and
with
respect
to
the
other
definitions,
i
cannot
speak
categorically
with
respect
to
those
other
definitions
because
that's
not
the
matter
before
this
court.
i
can't
suggest
to
this
court
a
wholesale
general
policy
of
these
definitions
are
jurisdictional
and
these
definitions
are
not
jurisdictional.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
justice
o'connor,
i
would
say
the...
the
consequences
of
not
affirming
are
even
more
severe.
congress,
in
1964,
made
a
clear
decision
that
it
wanted
small
businesses
not
to
be
burdened
with--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--but
one--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--one...
one
of
the...
one
of
the
concerns,
i
believe,
that
congress
did
have
with
respect
to
small
employers
was
the
fact
that
in
terms
of
small
employers,
you
are
dealing
with
less
sophisticated
litigants,
less
sophisticated
litigants
with
less
access
to
legal
resources
that
bigger
companies
have.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
no,
your
honor.
i
handled
this
matter
all
in
post
trial.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
i
think--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--i
think
that
would
be
contrary,
however,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
the
previous
holdings
of
this
court
where
they
say
you
do
look
to
the
logical
deductions--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--that
you
look
to
all
the
statutes.
for
example,
petitioner
makes
note
of
zipes,
but
if...
if
the
jurisdictional
statute
is
going
to
be
the
be
all
and
end
all
of...
of
the
analysis
and
the
discussion,
then
zipes
would
have
merely
looked
and
said,
oh,
well,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
in
the
jurisdictional
provision.
end
of
discussion.
but
zipes
didn't
do
that.
zipes
said
we
need
to
look
at
the...
the
jurisdictional
statute,
the
way
it's
structured.
we
need
to
look
at
congressional
intent
and
the
legislative
history,
how
they
referred
to
this
matter.
we
need
to
look
at
our
prior
cases
how
we
referred
to
this
matter.
so
i
think
to
say
just,
okay,
let's
look
at
the
jurisdictional
statute...
one,
i
think
there
are
two
problems
with
it.
one--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
but
zipes
also
dealt
with
a
legislative
history
where
they
referred
to
it
as
a
statute
of
limitations
period.
zipes
also
said,
okay,
we
have
other
cases
where
we
have
used
the
term
jurisdictional,
but
more
often
than
not,
we've
referred
to
this
as
a
limitations
period.
zipes
looked
at
the
whole
context
and
said,
yes,
we're
not
going
to
be
held
by
a
few
random,
maybe
casual
or
careless
uses
of
the
term
jurisdictional,
but
we
are
going
to
look
at
the
whole
thing.
here,
the
legislative
history
has
traditionally
referred
to
this
as
a
jurisdictional
provision.
the
'72
amendments,
which
increase...
decrease
the
number
of
employees
necessary
from
25
to
15,
referred
to
it
as
an
expansion
of
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
had
the
matter
come
up
before
it
always
in
jurisdictional
terms.
this
court
has
referred
to
this.
eeoc
has
referred
to
it
as
jurisdictional.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
seeing
the
errors
of
their
ways,
i
guess.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
your
honor,
i
think
the
reason
that
the
number
of
employees
should
be
different...
treated
differently
is
because
we
go
back
to
the
aldinger
question,
and
the
aldinger
question
is
this
court
has
to
decide
did
congress
want
to
give
this
type
of
jurisdiction
to
the
lower
federal
courts.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
aldinger
dealt
with
a
pendant
party
issue,
yes,
your
honor.
kenosha,
however,
dealt
with...
as
the
chief
justice
has
indicated,
kenosha
dealt
with
a
definition
that
excluded
counties
from
section
1983
and
that
was
found
to
be
implicitly
brought
into
the...
the
jurisdictional
grant
for
civil
rights
actions.
so
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
something
is
or
is
not
in
the
jurisdictional
statute
cannot
be
determinative
because
ultimately
you
do
need
to
go
back
to
the
question
of
did
congress
want
to
give
this
type
of
jurisdiction
to
the
lower
federal
courts.
my
question
would
be
why
would
congress
seek
to
give
this
type
of
jurisdiction
to
the
lower
federal
courts
for
a
whole
category
of
cases
where,
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
hishon,
it
has
granted
these
businesses
complete
immunity
from
title
vii?
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
true,
justice
ginsburg.
the
difference,
however,
between
the
immunity
in
those
cases
and
the
type
of
immunity
here
that
the
court
talked
about
in
hishon...
immunity
for
a
police
officer
in
a
civil
rights
case
with
qualified
immunity
will
depend
upon
a
police
officer's
particular
actions
in
that
particular
case.
the
police
officer,
in
general,
can
be
sued
under
section
1983.
the
immunity
that's
present
here,
with
respect
to
small
employers,
has
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
actions
of
that
employer.
an
employer
who
employs
12
people
at
most
can
engage
in
the
most
egregious
employment
discrimination
and
harassment
possible,
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
said,
as
a
policy
matter,
on
balance
we
would
rather
accept
that
kind
of
awful
conduct
because
we
don't
want
to
impose
these
burdens
on
small
businesses.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
yes,
your
honor,
or
leave
it
to
the
states
and
let
the
states
do
it.
but
we
don't
want
the
federal
government
to
be
intruding
into
the
operations...
into
the
culture
of
these
small
businesses,
and
that
i
believe
is
the
difference
between
the
immunity
that
you
mentioned,
the
qualified
or
prosecutorial
type
immunity,
which
depends
upon
actions,
and
this
immunity
here
which
depends
upon
simply
the
status
of
the
defendant,
the
whole
class--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--the
absolute
immunity,
justice
souter,
that
i'm
most
familiar
with
would
be
prosecutorial
immunity.
i
think
there
can
still
be
exceptions
for
prosecutorial
immunity.
i
think
a
prosecutor,
depending
upon
the
type
of
actions
he's
engaged
in,
can
still
be
subject
to
liability.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
it
certainly...
yes,
your
honor,
i
will
concede
it's
a
different
kind
of
inquiry.
but
i...
i
do
think,
though,
here
the
categorical
exclusion
of
small
businesses
is
a
clear
indication
of
congressional
intent
of
what
congress
wanted
to
have
happen.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
another...
well,
your
honor,
i'll
offer
another
distinction
then.
the
other
distinction
is
prosecutorial
immunity
and
qualified
immunity,
for
that
matter,
are
court
created
entities--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--court
created
defenses.
and
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
this
court
nor
any
other
court
has
the
power
to
define
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that
is
congress'
purview
and
power.
only
congress
can
limit
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
define
the
court's
jurisdiction
for
the
lower
federal
courts.
here,
congress
has
spoken
with
respect
to
small
businesses.
it's
a
different
matter,
i
would
suggest,
with
respect
to
prosecutors,
which
is
an
immunity
that
is...
is
a
product
of
common
law
and...
and
a
judicial
creation.
i
would
also
want
to
point
out
that...
another
thing.
the
solicitor
general
indicated
that
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the...
the
liability
section,
he
implied
that
it
just
imposes
the
employer
definition
into
the...
all
the
other
causes
of
action.
in
fact,
it
does
not.
it
says,
it...
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
an
employer
to,
and
then
it
defines
what
is
unlawful.
so
i
think
there
again
it's
indicating
a
difference
between
other
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
and
the
employer
relationship
and
the
employer
existence
under
title
vii.
ultimately,
what
this
boils
down
to
is
whether
or
not
small
businesses
are
going
to
continue
to
receive
the
protection
that
congress
has
indicated
that
it
wanted
them
to
have.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
i
think
they
would
be
offered
some
level
of
protection,
justice
souter,
through
summary
judgment.
the
problem
is
summary
judgment
offers
its
own
unique
hurdles
to
a
defendant.
and
again,
it's
a
difference--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--it's...
it's
a
different
standard
as
well,
your
honor,
because
under
summary
judgment,
a
plaintiff
has
it
within
their
capability...
have
to
view
all
the
inferences
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff,
and...
and
the
small
business
could
end
up
being
dragged
into
the
litigation
further
and
further
than
i
think
congress
intended.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
your
honor,
actually
i...
i
would
not
have
viewed
it
as
outside
of
congress'
contemplation
or
intent
because
congress...
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
part
of
legislative
history.
congress
in
1990
enacted
the
ada,
and
they
adopted
the
employer
definition
from
title
vii.
and
at
the
time
that
congress
adopted
title
vii's
employer
definition
for
the
ada,
all
but
one
circuit
court
had
decided
that
this
was
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
if
you
decide
something
is
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
you
take
with
it
the
unfairness.
and
i'm
not
going
to
contend
that
it's
not
sometimes
unfair
to
parties,
some
of
the
consequences
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
but
you
take
that
with
it
when
you
decide
that
it's
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
congress
in
1990
adopted
for
the
ada
the
title
vii
definition.
so
it's
implied
that
they
understood
what
was
going
on.
in
1991,
they...
they
had
the
civil
rights
act
and
amended
and
provided
for
jury
trials
in
these
types
of
matters.
and
again,
congress
was
aware
of
the
state
of
the
law.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
and
congress
did
not--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--seek
a
change.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
and...
and,
justice
souter,
i
understand
that
point.
however,
i...
i
tend
to
believe
that
this
is,
after
all,
an
aberration
case.
petitioner
has
suggested
and
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
that
businesses
may
tend
to
sandbag
this
issue.
i
simply
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
realistic
danger
at
all.
in
this
case,
quite
frankly,
the
matter
was
overlooked,
and
that's
how
we
ended
up
here.
but
in
most
cases,
these
small
businesses
are
not
going
to
be
looking
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
and
go
through
a
whole
trial
and
then
say,
oh,
well,
i
had
my
shot
at
it.
let
me
see.
if...
if
it
doesn't
work
out
now,
i'll
get
out
as
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
most
cases,
small
businesses
are
going
to
say,
make
this
case
go
away
from
me
as
fast
as
you
can.
and
so
i
don't
think
that
that's
really
much
of
a
danger
to
suggest
that
this
is
a
pattern
that's
going
to
be
repeated,
especially
after
a
decision
from
this
court.
if
this
court,
as
we
believe
that
it
should,
comes
down
and
holds
that
this
is
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
i
think
parties
will
raise
the
matter
and
get
it
disposed
of.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
i
think--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--i...
i
believe
that
the...
the
case
law
has
uniformly
held
that
you
look
at
the
time
of
the
discrimination
to
determine
the
number
of
employees.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
even
if
it's
a
question
of
jurisdiction,
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
do
think
ultimately,
though,
it
does
matter
because
it
does
become
a
matter...
it
doesn't
matter
for
the
plaintiff.
it
doesn't
matter
for
the
plaintiff
whether
or
not
it's
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
or
a
matter
of
the
merits
because
the
bottom
line
is
they're
going
to
lose
in
either
event.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
in
this
particular--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--and,
your
honor,
and
i
would
urge
that
those
kind
of
matters
that
need
to
be
addressed
are
best
addressed
by
the
court
as
opposed
to
by
a
jury.
i
think
to
the
matter
of
determining
whether
or
not
someone
is
a...
is
an
independent
contractor--
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
--i
just...
your
honor,
i
simply
do
not
believe
a
defendant
would
generally
do
that
because,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
the
problem
with
that
is
if
i'm
representing
the
defendant,
all
right,
and
i'm
going
to
defend
my
case
on
the
merits
and
i
know
i
got
this
15
employee
question
here,
i
go
to
trial,
let's
suppose
i
win.
i
win
at
trial
in
federal
court.
subject
matter
jurisdiction
can
be
raised
by
the
plaintiff.
now,
after
i've
won
at
trial,
the
plaintiff
stands
up
and
says,
oh,
this
court
didn't
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
get
a
do
over.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
your
honor,
but
again,
i...
i
simply
don't
believe
that
that's
going
to
be
a
problem
that's
going
to
come
up.
i
think
the
importance
of...
of
categorizing
this
as
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
to
avoid...
among
other
things,
is
adding
another
complicating
factor
to
a
jury
trial
because,
if
you
make
this
a
matter
of
the
merits
now...
counsel
for
petitioner
describes
in
his
brief
extended
hearings
to
determine
the
number
of
employees.
we're
now...
if
you
make
it
part...
just
a
part
of
the
merits,
now
before
you
can
get
to
the
actual
issue
of
discrimination,
a
jury
is
going
to
have
to
sit
through
and
try
to
decide
how
many
employees
there
were.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
your
honor,
i...
i
heard
that
argument
as
well.
all
i
can
say
is
given
the
number
of
factors
that
are
laid
out
under,
for
example,
the
fifth
circuit
law
to
determine
whether
or
not
somebody
is
an
independent
contractor
or
an
employee,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
more
like
the
function
of
a
judge
than
a
jury
because
it's
a
matter
of
balancing
of
the
relevant
factors.
mr.
brett
john
prendergast
thank
you.
