well,
but
what's
the
rule
that
you
suggest
we
look
to
in
deciding
whether
a
provision
is
jurisdictional?
because,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
in
1983
cases
where
the
question
is
whether
the
defendant
is
a
person,
we've
held
that
is
jurisdictional.
so
what
is
the
rule
in
telling
us
when
we
should
treat
something
as
jurisdictional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
more
than.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
establish
that
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
it's
your
burden
to
prove
it,
how
can
it
be
waived
by
the
defendant?
i
don't
understand
your
theory.
justice
sandra

o'connor
was
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
the
practical
consequences
of
affirming
here
are
severe
in
terms
of
handling
these
cases.
and
we've
pointed
out
in
some
recent
cases
of
ours
that
we've
been
a
little
sloppy
in
the
past
in
using
the
word
jurisdiction.
so
it
looks
to
me
like
there
are
many
indicators
that
would
point
to
not
treating
the
15
employee
requirement
as
one
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it's
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant
to
raise
some
objection.
who
knows
better
than
the
employer
how
many
employees
the
employer
has
had?
i
mean,
it's
totally
within
your
capacity
to
say,
wait
a
minute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we
didn't
have
15.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
you
representing
this
employer
at
the
time?
