justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
practical
consequence
of
the
one
or
the
other?
number
one,
if
you
don't
raise
it
below,
you
can
still
raise
it
on
appeal
if
it's
jurisdictional.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
number
two,
the...
if
it's
a
jurisdictional
question,
it
would
be
decided
by
the...
by
the
judge
rather
than
by
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
always
the
case.
i
mean,
why...
you
know,
if
those
disadvantages...
those
disadvantages
will
always
exist.
so
why
would
congress
ever
make
something
jurisdictional
rather
than
simply
making
it
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action?
you
understand
what
i'm
saying?
i
mean,
that's
always
a
consequence.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet,
you...
you
felt
that
some
things
are
jurisdictional.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
you...
you
pleaded...
you
pleaded
that...
that
the
defendant
was...
was
an
employer
under
the
act.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
the
definition
of
employer
that
says
he
has
to
have
more
than...
more
than
15
employees.
so,
in
effect,
you...
in
making
your
complaint,
you...
you
at
least
implied
and
maybe
said
that
this
person
is
an
employer
under
the
act.
so
it
seems
to
me
at
that
point
the...
the
burden
shifts
to
the
other
side
to
say...
the
burden
of
going
forward
of
saying
no,
this
person
isn't
an
employer
under
the
act,
and
if
they
say
nothing,
then
they've
accepted
what...
what
your
complaint
on
its
face
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
knew
you
would.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it...
does
it
have
to
be
resolved
preliminarily?
why
can't
you
leave
the
jurisdictional
question
to
be
decided
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
with
all
the
other
questions?
is
there
some
rule
of
law
that
says
that
a
jurisdictional
question
must
be
confronted
before
the
trial
and
before
the
merits?
indeed,
most
jurisdictional
questions
are
reexamined
as
the
trial
proceeds.
that
is,
you
know,
initially
the
court
will
say,
yes,
there
appears
to
be
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
pleading.
then
if
there's
a
motion
to
dismiss,
yes,
there...
there
appears
to
be
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavits.
but
then
if
the
trial
proceeds
and
it
turns
out
that,
in
fact,
there
isn't
jurisdiction,
the
court
dismisses.
so
why
couldn't
this
jurisdictional
question
always
be
handled
that
way?
just...
just
leave
it
to
be
resolved
during
the
trial.
it
wouldn't
slow
anything
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
this
is
a
third
consequence
of
the
jurisdictional
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
issue
is
jurisdictional,
all
the
pendant
state
claims
don't
belong
there
and
they've
got
to
be
chucked
out;
whereas,
if
it
just
goes
to
the
merits,
the
pendant
claims
are
properly
before
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
important
consequence.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
prendergast--
justice
antonin
scalia
--my
problem
with...
with
your...
your
contention
is
that
i
don't
know
how
it
is
that
you...
that
you
intuit
that
this
one
definition
is
jurisdictional.
i
mean,
the
definition...
the...
the
15
employee
limit
is...
is
part
of
the
definition
of
employer
in
section
701.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
13
other
definitions
in
section
1701.
for
example,
it
defines
on
the
basis
of
sex.
now,
if...
if
you
contest
whether
a
particular
remark
or
a
particular
practice
of
the
employer
was...
fell
within
that
definition,
was
on
the
basis
of
sex
or
not,
would
you
say
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
will
you
challenge...
well,
why
are
you
challenging
jurisdiction
when
you're...
when
you're
saying
the...
the
definition
of...
of
employer
has
not
been
met,
but
you
are
not
challenging
jurisdiction
when
you
say
the
definition
of
on
the
basis
of
sex
has
not
been
met.
why...
why
pick
on
one
rather
than
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i...
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that's
what
it
comes
down
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
how
do
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
both
definitions
in
section
701--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
does
one
of
them
express
one
thing
and
another
not
express--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
other
words,
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
helps
your
case.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think...
do
you
think
it's
possible
that...
that
indian
tribes
could
be
jurisdictional
but
an
employer
couldn't?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
two
the
questions
are
quite
different.
an
indian
tribe
is
always
an
indian
tribe.
right?
and
you're...
you're
excluding...
just
as
a
prosecutor
is
always
a
prosecutor.
you're
excluding
a
whole
category
of
people.
but
you're...
you're
not
excluding
a
category
of
employers
here,
are
you?
because
it's
a...
it's
a
factual
question,
whether
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
offense,
the
particular
company
was
employing
more
than
15
people.
it
isn't
that
this
company
forever
has
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're...
you're
not
arguing
for
the
indian
tribes
here.
