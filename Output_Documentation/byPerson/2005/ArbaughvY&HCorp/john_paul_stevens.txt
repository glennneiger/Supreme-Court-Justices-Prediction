justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
hold
that
the
plaintiff
must
allege
the
employer
is
not
an
indian
tribe?

justice
john
paul
stevens
over

[laughter]
i
say
in...
in
those
case
that
you
just
cited,
did
they
hold
that
the
plaintiff
must
allege
that
the
employer
is
not
an
indian
tribe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
interpret
those
cases
as,
in
fact,
holding
that
if
there
was
a
trial
and
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
against
what
turns
out
later
to
be
an
indian
tribe,
that
after
the
case
is
taken
up
on
appeal,
the
indian
tribe
can
have
the
judgment
set
aside?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
the
practice
of
law
has
returned
to
normal
in
new
orleans?
