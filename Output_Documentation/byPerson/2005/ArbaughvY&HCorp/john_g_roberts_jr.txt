chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
arbaugh
v.
y
&
h
corporation.
mr.
joseffer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
schwartz.
excuse
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
argument,
though,
that
when
you're
talking
about
a
threshold
question
like
coverage,
who
the
statute
covers,
that
it's
quite
different
from
the
cause
of
action
cases,
many
of
which
you
rely
on
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
more
a
question
of...
of
whether
or
not
the...
there's
been
a
violation
of
title
vii.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
number
of
employee
issue
is
whether
you're
covered
at
all,
whether
you
have
to
conform
your
conduct
to
that
law.
your
question...
your...
your
case
of
whether
someone
has
been
discharged
or
not
just
goes
to
whether
there's
been
a
violation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
city
of...
in
city
of
kenosha,
of
course,
the
court
went
beyond
the
jurisdictional
grant
and
it
said
that
the
definition
of
the
term
person
in
1983
raised
a
jurisdictional
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but...
but
maybe...
but
that
doesn't
sound
like
a
reasonable
agreement.
all
you...
so
you
file
one
sentence
saying
this
person
violated
title
vii.
are
you
impliedly
including
all
of
the
allegations
of
what
constitutes
a
violation
of
title
vii
because
if
you
didn't
allege
every
particular
element,
it
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
title
vii?
that's
not
how
pleading
works.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
true
in
a
lot
of
areas.
i
think
of
admiralty.
if
there's
an
issue
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
that
questions
whether
an
injury
is
caused
by
a
vessel
in
navigable
water,
you
often
have
extended
litigation
over
that
jurisdictional
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
schwartz.
now
mr.
joseffer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
interpreted
section...
the
use
of
the
word
person
in
section
1983.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
city
of
kenosha
was
just
kind
of
a
silly
waste
of
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
1331
was
applicable
there
as
well.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
what
have
juries
been
determining?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
the...
that's
the
consequence
of
a
determination
that
it's
jurisdictional
in
any
case.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
if
you
had
a
case
where
you
didn't
dispute
that
the
issue
was
jurisdictional
and
there
had
been
a
jury
trial
on
the
pendant
state
law
claims,
we'd
still
have
to
throw
that
out.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
joseffer.
mr.
prendergast,
we'll
now
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
other
aspects
of
title
vii
do
you
think
are
jurisdictional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's...
what's
wrong
with
the
rule?
we're
not
dealing
with
article
iii
here.
what's
wrong
with
the
rule
that
if
congress
doesn't
put
it
in
the
jurisdictional
section,
it's
not
jurisdictional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
make
the
future
cases
a
lot
easier
to
decide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--does
it
make
a
difference
on
the...
the...
does
the
categorization
make
a
difference
on
the
relative
time
of
the
inquiry
for
the
15
employees?
you
have
16
employees
when
the
discrimination
takes
place.
by
the
time
the
lawsuit
is
filed,
you've
only
got
14.
does
it
matter
whether
that's
called
jurisdiction
or
going
to
the
merits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even...
even
if
it's
a
question
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
prendergast.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
schwartz,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
