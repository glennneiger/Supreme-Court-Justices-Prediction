mr.
daryl
joseffer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
justice
o'connor,
we
think
the
rule
here,
because
it's
a
question
of
congressional
intent,
is
simply
how
to
best
interpret
the
relevant
statutes.
here,
congress
twice
unambiguously
conferred
jurisdiction
over
all
title
vii
claims,
at
least
twice,
first
in
section
1331
and
again
in
a
title
vii
jurisdictional
provision
which
confers
jurisdiction
over
all
claims
brought
under
title
vii.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
sorry.
is
that
better?
thank
you.
as
i
was
saying,
the
question
is...
is...
because
it's
a
question
of
congressional
intent,
we
think
normal
rules
of
construction
apply.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
about
whether
the
title
vii
subject
matter
jurisdictional
provision
is
now
redundant
in
light
of
the
reduction
of
the
amount
in
controversy
from
section
1331.
technically
we
think
the
answer
is
yes,
but
it
still
has
great
interpretive
value
because
it
shows
that
when
congress
meant
to
address
the
jurisdictional
question
in
title
vii,
it
expressly
said
so
and
it
did
so
by
conferring
jurisdiction
over
all
title
vii
claims.
the
definition
of
employer,
which
is
the
relevant
issue
here,
does
not
itself
speak
in
jurisdictional
terms
and
does
not
modify
in
any
way
title
vii's
broad
jurisdictional
provision.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
well,
as
the
court
has
remarked
on
multiple
occasions,
the
word
jurisdiction
is
a
word
of
many,
many
meanings,
and
the
eeoc
has
never
said
that
it's
a
question
of
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
it
was...
until
about
5
or
6
years
ago,
eeoc
in
an
administrative
context
used
the
word
jurisdiction
to
refer
to
the
definition
of
employer,
statutes
of
limitations,
and
a
variety
of
other
matters
that
are
clearly
not
subject
matter
jurisdictional.
but
after
this
court
held
in
zipes
that
another
provision
of
title
vii
is
not
one
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
eeoc
realized
that
its
administrative
use
of
the
broad
term
jurisdiction
was
confusing.
so
5
or
6
years
ago,
eeoc
amended
its
compliance
manual
and
no
longer
refers
to
any
of
these
questions
as
jurisdictional.
but
i
guess
the
key
point
is
it
never
said
it
was
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
about
whether
a
threshold
question
of
coverage
could
be
considered
different
than
another
element
of
the
cause
of
action.
i
think
the
important
thing
here
is
that
the
place
where
congress
used
the
term
person
is
in
setting
forth
what
conduct
is
unlawful.
title
vii
says
that
it
shall
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
a
person
to
discriminate
in
various
ways.
so
the
way
the
definition
is
irrelevant
is
in
setting
forth
the
scope
of
unlawful
conduct
which
is
a
quintessential
merits
or
cause
of
action
inquiry
as
opposed
to
a
jurisdictional
one.
the
city
of
kenosha
is
different
because,
as
petitioner's
counsel
recognized,
that
interpreted
not
section
1331
but
section
1343
which--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--interpreted
the
word
person
in
section
1983
not
to
apply
to
municipal
corporations,
but
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
inquiry,
it
said
that
the...
that
1343
did
not
confer
jurisdiction.
in
mt.
healthy
several
years
later,
the
court
held
that
although
section
1343
was
narrowly
limited
to
actions
that
are
authorized
by
law,
which
connoted
somewhat
of
a
merits
inquiry,
section
1331's
jurisdictional
provision
is
not
so
limited
and
is
not
limited
by
the
definition
of
person,
which
is
what
the
court
held
in
section
1331.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--at
the
time
section
1331
had
the
amount
in
controversy
requirement,
and
i
think
that's
why
now
that
section
1331
no
longer
has
the
amount
in
controversy
requirement,
this
court's
section
1343
cases
have
more
or
less
petered
out
because
plaintiffs
can
now
just
go
under
section
1331.
and
justice
scalia,
you
asked
about
the...
the
practical
consequences.
i
agree
there
are
three
practical
consequences,
and
from
that
perspective,
it
makes
little
sense
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
thought
that
this
requirement
should
be
jurisdictional.
the
first
is
whether
the
issue
can
be
raised
at
any
point
in
the
litigation.
the
second
is
who
decides
the
issue,
and
the
third
is
whether,
after
dismissal
of
the
federal
claims,
the
state
law
claims
must
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
and
given
that
this
is
just
one
of
many
facts
that
arises
in
determining
whether
a
plaintiff
can
state
a
valid
title
vii
claim,
it's
hard
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
thought
that
this
is
the
one
fact
that
should
be
raised
at
the
end
of
the
case
instead
of
at
the
outset
where
it
can
be
adjudicated
in
an
orderly
manner
with
all
of
the
other
facts.
also,
common
law
juries
have
been
deciding
for
centuries
whether
a
worker
is
an
employee
or
an
independent
contractor
for
purposes
of
agency
and
tort
law.
and
since
that
is
the
ultimate
dispute
here,
it
seems
remarkable
to
think
that
that's
the
one
fact
that
congress
would
say
should
not
go
to
a
jury.
and
similarly--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
the
question
as
to
whether
there
are
15
employees
here--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--turns
on
whether
some
workers
are
independent
contractors
or
employees.
and
for
agency
law
purposes,
which
becomes
relevant
in
tort
law
in
terms
of
vicarious
liability,
the
question
whether
someone
is
an
employee
or
an
independent
contractor
is
a...
is
a
longstanding
jury
question.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
if
the...
if
the...
if
those...
if
the
delivery
drivers
were
workers...
were
employees,
there's
no
question
there
were
15
employees.
so
the
question
was
whether
some
workers
count
as
employees
and
whether
a
worker
is
an
employee
or
an
independent
contractor
is...
is
a
longstanding
question
for
a
jury
when
there's
a
disputed
issue
of...
of
fact.
and
then
the
third
consequence...
i
mean,
here,
there...
the
jury
rendered
a
verdict
on
the
state
law
claims,
found
in
favor
of
respondent
on
one,
petitioner
on
the
other.
and
it
seems
highly
unlikely
that
congress
would
think
that
that
jury
verdict
should
be
vacated
and
the
case
retried
in
state
court
because
the
defendant
has
14
instead
of
15
employees.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
that's
correct,
and
there...
there
are
circumstances--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes,
but
i
think
that's
one
reason
that
congress
does
not
ordinarily
make
jurisdiction
turn
on
those
types
of
facts.
in
the
admiralty
concept...
context
that
you
recognized,
it's
necessary
to
distinguish
between
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
general
federal
question
jurisdiction.
so
congress
had
to
distinguish
in
some
way,
and
the
way
it
did
was
by
saying,
well,
is
the
alleged
injury
caused
by
a
vessel
in
navigable
waters
or
elsewhere.
but
ordinarily
when...
a
distinction
does
not
have
to
be
drawn
like
that.
in
section
1343,
it
was
the
same
because
congress
didn't
want
that
to
be
conflated
with
section
1331
at
the
time.
when
jurisdiction
does
not
necessarily
turn
on
contextual
factors,
congress
ordinarily
just
lets
the
broad
jurisdictional
ground
of
section
1331
be
a
clear,
simple
threshold
inquiry
so
parties
can
determine
they're
in
the
right
court,
and
then
the
case
can
be
proceeded...
can
be
litigated
on
the
merits
from
there.
justice
kennedy
asked
whether
a
court
could
raise
the
issue
on
its
own,
even
assuming
that
it's
a
merits
issue.
and
i
think
the
answer
is
that
although
the
defendant
waived
the
issue
here
and
therefore
has
no
right
to
insist
that
it
be
raised,
most
waiver
doctrines
are
discretionary,
and
therefore,
courts
retain
some
inherent
discretion
to
overlook
waivers
in
some
circumstances.
that
discretion
would
be
greater
at
the
outset
of
a
case
where
a
federal
court
decided
it
should
not
be
deciding
a
case
than
it
would
be
once
a
jury
had
already
decided
a
case,
which
is
what
happened
here.
finally,
respondent
relies
on
a
number
of
this
court's
title
vii
decisions
for
the
proposition
that
this
requirement
is
one
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
basic
point
is
that
this
court
has
never
opined
in
dicta
or
in
holding
on
whether
this
requirement
is
one
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
the
court's
only
title
vii
subject
matter
jurisdiction
case
is
zipes
which
held
that
a
requirement
was
not
jurisdictional
because
it
was
not...
did
not
textually
modify
title
vii's
broad
jurisdictional
provision
and
in
light
of
other
relevant
canons
of
construction.
and
for
precisely
the
same
reasons,
the
definition
of
employer
does
not
textually
modify
the
definitional
provision
and
therefore
it
does
not
limit
the
court's
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
this
claim
either
up
or
down
based
on
its
merits.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
