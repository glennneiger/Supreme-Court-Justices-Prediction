justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
an
allegation
that
the
company,
petitioner,
or
whatever
it
was...
that
they
violated
the
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
guess
that...
they
must
have
thought
that
there
were
15
or
more
employees
because
otherwise
you
wouldn't
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
that
denied?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
denied
it.
then
they
presented
evidence,
and
their
evidence
was
a,
b,
c,
d,
e.
and
i
guess
then
you
presented
some
contrary
evidence,
and
you
didn't
present
any
evidence
that
he
wasn't
an
employer.
so
i
guess
the
odds
are
he
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
the
odds
are
he
was,
they
win
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
guess
maybe
you
could
have
appealed
on
that
point.
so
did
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
guess
it's
waived
unless
it's
jurisdictional.
so
we're
back
to
the
jurisdictional
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
never
heard
of
a
point
on
the
merits
that
if
you...
you
think
you're
right.
it's
right
on
the
merits,
the
element
of
the
offense.
you
don't
think
they
proved
it,
but
unfortunately,
you
don't
raise
that
in
the
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
did
you
win
or
lose
on
that?
