justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
first
sentence,
but
not
in
the
venue
part.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
what...
how
does
the
waiver
work?
suppose
the
judge
pre
verdict
says,
you
know,
i'm
concerned
that
there
are
less
than
15
employees.
can
the
plaintiff
say,
oh,
well,
now,
your
honor,
you
can't
get
into
that?
they
waived
that.
they
didn't
raise
it.
i
mean,
how
does
that
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
the
judge
just
has
to
watch
the
case
sail
over
the
waterfall
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
in
my
case
nobody
mentions
it
but
the
judge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
and
the...
and
the
judge
calls
it
sua
sponte
to
the
attention
of
the
parties.
