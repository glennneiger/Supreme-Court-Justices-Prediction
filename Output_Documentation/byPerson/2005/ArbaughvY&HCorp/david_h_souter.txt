justice
david
h.
souter
in
your
pleadings,
did
you
say
he's
an
employer?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
you
use
the
term
employer?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
the
word
employer
used
in
the
pleadings?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i'm
just
asking
the
really
formal
question.
was
the
word
employer
used
to
refer
to
your
client
at
any
point
in
the
pleadings?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that...
that
argument
doesn't
apply
to
absolute
immunity
cases,
and
yet
in
absolute
immunity
cases,
once
again,
it's
clear
there's
jurisdiction.
there's
simply
immunity.
the
immunity
doesn't
depend
on
any
particular
facts.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
have
to
determine
whether
he's
acting
as
a
prosecutor.
sure.
we
have
to
determine
whether
the
president
was
acting
in
a
presidential
capacity,
but
that's
not
the
kind
of
fact
inquiry
that
you
were
talking
about
with
respect
to
the
qualified
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
i
don't
see
why
the
same
argument
can't
be
made
with
respect
to
prosecutors.
it
is
clear
that
if...
if
an
individual
is
acting
in
a
prosecutorial
capacity
and
enjoys
the
appointment
as
a
prosecutor,
that
at
least
the...
the
system...
we're
not
necessarily
talking
about
congress
here.
the
system
says
there...
there
should
be,
as
a
categorical
matter,
an...
an
immunity
from
prosecution.
and
yet,
that
does
not
go
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
essentially
the
exact
argument
that
you're
making
here,
and
i
don't
see
why
it
should
be
any
more
sound
here
than
it
would
be
in
the
absolute
immunity
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
can't
get
they
get
the
protections
through
summary
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
among
other
things,
you...
you've
got
to
do
it
up
front.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if...
if
we're
worried
about
dragging
people
into
litigation,
i
presume
congress
didn't
intend,
as
a...
as
a
general
matter,
to
allow
the...
the
situation
that
we've
got
here.
one
party
has
been
dragged
through
a
piece
of
litigation
and,
having
lost,
has
decided
it
wants
to
take
another
shot
at
getting
out
of
the
case.
surely
you
can't
say
that
was
within
the
contemplation
of
congress'
intent.
justice
david
h.
souter
my...
my
point--
justice
david
h.
souter
--my
point
is
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--my
point
is
not
that
congress
in
some
specific
sense,
when
it
establishes
a
jurisdictional
requirement,
does
not
intend
the
occasional
costs
that
the
system
has
to
bear
by
virtue
of
treating
that
requirement
as
jurisdictional.
my
point
simply
is
that
if
we
are
in...
in
a
situation
in
which
it
is
not
clear
whether
it's
jurisdictional
or
not,
the
issue
can
be
raised,
in
effect,
up
front
effectively
through
summary
judgment,
and
in
the
alternative,
can
be
treated...
and...
as...
as
an
ineffective
fact
element,
and
in
the
alternative,
can
be
left,
in
effect,
forever
to
be
raised
as
a
jurisdictional
element.
the
fact
that
it
can
be
treated
effectively
up
front
is
one
reason
to
think
that
congress
would
probably
have
wanted
that
fact
issue
to
be
regarded
not
as
jurisdictional
but
as
elemental
so
that
it
can
be
gotten
out
of
the
way
and
the
parties
are
not
going
to
go
through
entire
trials
only
to
have
the
whole
thing
upset
by
a
belated
jurisdictional
argument.
that's
my
only
point.
