mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
mr.
schwartz.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
a
federal
court
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
brought
under
title
vii
regardless
of
whether
an
employer
has
15
employees.
this
is
so
because
when
congress
enacted
title
vii,
it
included
a
specific
jurisdictional
grant
and
that
grant
provides
that
jurisdiction
will
exist
in
the
federal
courts
over
all
claims
brought
under
the
act.
this
specific
grant
of
jurisdiction
is
consistent
with
the
more
general
grant
of
jurisdiction
contained
in
28
u.s.c.
1331
wherein
federal
question
jurisdiction
exists
over
all
claims
that
arise
under
a
federal
law.
title
vii
is
a
federal
law.
the
fifth
circuit
erred
when
it...
when
it
determined
that
the
employer
numerosity
issue
went
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
indeed,
when
title
vii
was
passed,
congress
actually
expanded
jurisdiction,
the
federal
question
issue
of
title
vii,
because
at
that
time
28
u.s.c.
1331
had
a
$10,000
amount
in
controversy
requirement
that
congress
did
away
with
because
the
jurisdictional
grant
contained
within
title
vii
made
no
mention
of
the
$10,000
requirement.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
i
would
agree
with
that.
indeed,
the
question--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--not
in
the
venue
part
and...
and
certainly...
because
it
does
apply
to
which
district
court
a
case
should
be
brought.
i
would
say
it...
it's
redundant
to
the
extent
of
conferring
jurisdiction
to
a
federal
court,
but
not
on
the
venue
provision--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--right.
it's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
well,
we're
talking
here
about
a
question
of
whether
or
not
coverage
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
it's
our
position
that
once
you
go
beyond
the
text
and
you
start
evaluating
the
various
aspects
of
title
vii,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
are
going
down
a...
a
slippery
slope.
an
example
would
be
a
case
perhaps
where
a...
in
fact,
a
case
that
i'm
currently
involved
in
where
a
plaintiff
is
alleging
that
they
were
discharged
discriminatorily.
and
the
reality
is
from
the
employer's
perspective,
that
that
person
was
never
terminated.
they're
still
an
active
employee.
that
is
an
essential
issue
of
a
cause
of
action.
the
coverage
of
title
vii--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
believe
that
the
analogy
applies
because
it
still
goes
to
whether
or
not
you
start
reading
the
act
beyond
the
jurisdictional
grant.
it's
unnecessary
to
go
beyond
the
jurisdictional
grant
because--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--well,
i...
i
would
not
necessarily
agree
that
that
goes
beyond
the
jurisdictional
grant
because
the
jurisdictional
grant
of...
contained
in
1334...
1343
requires
that...
that
jurisdiction
apply
against
a
person
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
and
that's
an
example
which
congress
has
done
many
times
of
putting
qualifiers
within
a
jurisdictional
grant.
an
example
of...
of
that
we...
we
attached
60
such
statutes
to
our
appendix
in
our
reply
brief,
but
a
specific
example,
which
i
think
is
applicable
here,
is
the
uniformed
service
employee
reemployment
rights
act
wherein
congress
put
in
that
the
act
would
only
apply
jurisdictionally,
subject
matter
jurisdictionally,
against
employers.
and
then
there's
a
subsequent
definition
of
employer
further
on
in...
in
the
statute
which
is
missing
here
because
title--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
that's
correct
as
well.
and
i
would
go
further
that
the
practical
problem
is
what
happened
in
our
case
where
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
trial...
in...
in
the
case
until
after
a
trial
on
the
merits
and
after
the
jury
returned
the
verdict,
and
we
wasted
a
lot
of
time.
it...
it
could
have
been
brought
up
beforehand
as
a...
a
substantive
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
a
12(b)(6)
motion
if
the
pleadings
resolved
the
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
well,
i...
i
think
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--well,
i...
i
think
if
i'm...
if
i'm
an
attorney
representing
a
plaintiff
and
i
want
to
make
an
evaluation
of
whether
or
not
i
have
a
claim,
i
want
to
first
evaluate
do
i
pass
a
jurisdictional
threshold.
if
a
come...
a
person
comes
into
my
office
and
says,
look,
this
happened
to
me,
i
want
to
bring
a
cause
of
action,
and
i
know
that
they
employ
less
than
15
people,
then
i'm
not
going
to
waste
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
well,
the
rule
that
has
existed
for
some
time
now,
going
back
to
bell
v.
hood,
is
a...
a
fair
way
to
look
at
this.
if
a
statute,
a
federal
law,
creates
a
cause
of
action,
then
a
cause...
a
cause
of
action
lies
absent
congress
expressly
limiting
or
qualifying
an...
a
jurisdictional
element
within
its
grant
contained
within
that
law,
which
is...
which
is
missing
completely
in
title
vii.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
it
could
be
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
more
than
15,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
yes.
that...
that's
the
plaintiff's
burden
just
like
it's
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
prove
that
they
were
terminated--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--we
did
not
plead
it
with
particularity.
we
pled
that
the
employer
sexually
harassed
the
plaintiff,
and
then
thereafter
in
the
pretrial
order,
it
was
not
raised
as
a
contested
issue
of
fact.
and
i
believe
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine
would
control
in
that
instance
because
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--if
it's...
if
it
doesn't
go
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--then
i
would
say
that
it
is
waived,
if
it's
been
answered--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--well,
let's
talk
about
two
different
examples.
if
we
have
pled
with
particularity
that
the
employer
has
15
or
more
employees
and
is
subject
to
title
vii
for
liability
purposes
and
the
defendant
in
their
answer
admits
that
fact,
then
that
becomes
a...
a
admission--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--all
right.
so
we
have
alleged
in
our
lawsuit
that
the
employer
terminated
or
sexually
harassed
the
plaintiff
and
the...
there
is
not...
it's
not
particularly
pled.
is
that
the
hypothetical,
justice
kennedy?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
i
would
think
that
if
the
judge
in
a...
in
a
federal
cause
of
action
was
troubled
by
any
element
of
the
claim,
based
upon
his
or
her
own
review
of
the
factual
setting,
it's
conceivable
that...
that
the
court
then
could
entertain
motions
on
that
particular
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
no.
and...
and
i
can...
i
can
tell
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
probably
handled
500
causes
of
action
for
discrimination
cases,
and
i've
never
seen
anybody
plead
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
somebody
has
15
employees.
it's
just
not
done.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
and...
and
it
was
admitted
and
then
it
was
never
challenged
thereafter
until
after
the
verdict.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
i
can
give
you
one
real
world
example,
justice
ginsburg.
i
represented
a
defendant
in
a
case
that
didn't
employ
15
people,
and
when
i
attempted
to
convince
the
plaintiff...
plaintiff's
lawyer
of
that
fact
after
the
litigation
commenced
and
they
weren't
willing
to...
to
go
ahead
and
voluntarily
dismiss,
i
simply
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
attaching
affidavit
material,
including
payroll
records.
and
then
once
the
plaintiff's
attorney
reviewed
that,
they
voluntarily
gave
up
and
the
case
was
dismissed.
that
would
be
the
way
it
would
normally
play
out,
provided
it's
not
held
to
be
an
issue
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
another
reason
why
this
should
not
be
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
goes
to
the
practical
elements
of
the
way
this
would
progress
in
litigation
and
title
vii's
admonition,
which
is
a
rare
admonition
in
legislation,
that
title
vii
cases
be
heard
in
an...
in
an
expedited
way.
in
enacting
that
particular
language,
it
appears
to
me
that
congress
was
acknowledging
that
this
is
a
very
important
law.
we're
trying
to
remediate
a
terrible
wrong,
that
is,
employment
discrimination.
so
we
don't
want
these
cases
to
languish.
it's
almost
as
though
it's
being
processed
like
a
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
injunction
proceeding,
that
this
is
a
case
that
should
move
very
quickly.
and
many
courts,
like
the
one
across
the
river
in
virginia
that
are
known
as
so
called
rocket
dockets,
process
these
cases
on
a
very
fast
track.
i
know
that...
that
court
does
it.
other
courts
that
i
practice
in
do
it
as
well
where
it
is
not
uncommon
that
from
the
pleading
that
a
trial
is
dead
is
as
quickly
as
6
months
thereafter.
if
this
was
to
be
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
we
had
to
initially
litigate
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
person
is
an
employer
and
putting
aside
all
other
issues
in
the
case,
it
would
invariably
result
in
a
dragged
out
process.
in
our
case,
as
we...
as
we
noted--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--and...
and
in
those
cases,
the
jurisdictional
grant
in
the
jones
act
does
include
elements
of
jurisdiction.
so
it's...
it's
required.
but
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
that
the
jones
act
has
the
same
type
of
language,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
title
vii
has,
requiring
that
these
cases
be
heard
expeditiously.
so--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
--there...
there's
a
few
problems
with
that.
one
is
that
it
is
not
uncommon
in
title
vii
cases
that
there
are
supplemental
state
claims
brought
in
the
cause
of
action,
and
so
we
would
have
a
situation
where
there
would
be
a
lot
of
wasted
effort
on
the
pending
claim
if,
at
some
point,
justice
scalia,
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
case
was
dismissed
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that
was
the
situation
in
our
case
where
we
had
a
pending
tort
claim
for
battery,
and
we
also
had
a
pending
claim
under
the
ancillary
louisiana
discrimination
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
in
addition,
the
court's
recent
opinions
addressing
subject
matter
jurisdiction
have
all
gone
back,
it
seems
to
me,
to
this
question
of
what
does
the
text
say.
the...
the
issue
of
not
conflating
the
use
of
the
word
jurisdiction,
which
has
been
referenced
in
a
number
of
the
court's
opinions,
steel
company,
kontrick,
eberhart,
scarborough,
all
point
to
the
fact
that
where
the
text
is
clear,
as
it
is
in
this
case,
and
there
is
no
ambiguity,
then
subject
matter
jurisdiction
lies
if
a
claim
is
brought
under
a
federal
act.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
if
there
are
no
additional
questions,
i...
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
as...
well,
my...
i
leave
that
to
other
people.
[laughter]
but
the...
i
could...
in
answer
to
that
question,
i
can
see
an
interesting
scenario
where
a
plaintiff
working
for
a
casino
on
an
indian
tribe,
there
might
be
a
question
of
who
the
actual
employer
is.
and...
and
that
could
come
up
and
that
would
certainly
involve
some
litigation.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
schwartz
no.
it's...
it's
a
struggle
somewhat
for
jury
pools.
the
state
court
in
particular,
because
it
only
covers
orleans
parish,
is...
is
really
struggling
with
pulling
in
jurors.
the
federal
courts
have
a
larger
number
of
parishes
to
draw
from.
i'm
actually
still
living
in
atlanta.
