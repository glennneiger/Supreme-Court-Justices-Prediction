mr.
gregory
c.
link
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
washington
supreme
court
correctly
held
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
and
state
law.
the
error
in
this
case,
as
in
blakely
cases
generally,
could
not
be
subjected
to
harmless
error
analysis.
i
think
it's
important
to
clarify
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and...
and
as
recognized
by
the
washington
supreme
court
in
its
decision
in
recuenco,
the
deadly
weapon
enhancement
and
the
firearm
enhancement
are,
in
fact,
lesser
and
greater
offenses
of
one
another.
we
know
that
based
on...
on
what...
what
action
the
court
took
on
remand.
it
didn't
dismiss
the...
the
enhancement
altogether.
it
said
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done
on
remand
was
imposition
of
the
lesser
enhancement.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
under
washington
law...
it's
important
to
understand
that
under
washington
law,
a
handgun
is...
is
a
deadly
weapon
per
se,
but
that
handgun
is
only
a
firearm
if
the
state
establishes
the
additional
fact
that
it
has
the
capacity
to
fire,
which
is...
which
is
why
the
statute,
the
deadly
weapon
statute,
and
the
definition
of
deadly
weapon
in...
in
the
statutory
provision
specifically
includes
handgun,
revolvers,
and
other
guns.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
the
definition
statue
of...
of
deadly
weapon
doesn't.
it's--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--it's
a
separate
provision
on
the
enhancement...
or
excuse
me...
as
to
the
length
of
the
enhancement
that
would
be
imposed
does.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
i
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
washington
law,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
and
again,
i
think
it
turns
on
the
fact
that
there's
this
additional
factor,
additional
element,
of
capacity
to
fire
that
differentiates
a
handgun
from
a
firearm.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
there
was
no
evidence,
i
think,
to
suggest
that
it
did.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
under
washington
law,
a
defendant
gets
a
lesser
included
instruction
so
long
as
the
evidence,
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
him,
would
support
the
fact
that
the
lesser
was...
was
included.
now,
it
can't
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
state...
or
whether
the
jury
simply
disbelieves
the
state's
proof,
but
it
can...
when
looking
at
the...
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
defendant,
look
at
holes
in
the
state's
evidence,
such
as
the
fact
that
there
is
no
evidence
before
this
jury
about
this
gun's
capacity
to
fire.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
as
a
matter
of
washington
law
and
as
of
the
fact
that
this
is,
indeed,
an
element
of
a
greater
offense,
there
is
a
requirement
on
the
state
to
come
forward
with
additional
proof
of
the
capacity
to
fire.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
there
is
not.
it's
the
statutory
language
of
the
deadly
weapon
enhancement
itself.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
the
fact
that
the
deadly
weapon
enhancement
can
apply
specifically
to
a
handgun
regardless
of
the
manner
in
which
it's
used.
for
instance,
it...
a...
a
handgun
that
does
not
have
the
capacity
to
fire
could
be
used
to...
to
strike
an
individual,
and
in
that
context
would
be
a
deadly
weapon
regardless
of
whether
it
was
likely
to
cause
a
serious
bodily
harm.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
again,
if
we
compare
the
definition
of
a
deadly
weapon
under
washington
law
with
the
definition
of
a
firearm
under
washington
law,
a
handgun
is
by
definition
a
deadly
weapon.
but
a
handgun
is
not
by
definition
a
firearm.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
it
would
seem
that
the...
the
same
definition
of
firearm
would
apply.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
no.
again,
i
believe
that
he...
he
asks...
an
individual
could
ask
for
an
instruction
in
that
case
and
still
maintain
that
the
state
hasn't
met
the
proof
of...
of
establishing
even
the
lesser.
and
there's
nothing
tactically
contradictory
about
doing
so.
if...
if
one...
if
an
attorney
can
convince
the
court
to...
to
allow
the
jury
to
consider
a
lesser,
and
then
still
challenge
that...
the
proof
of
that
lesser--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--if
the
firearm...
if
looking
at
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
state,
he
may
not
have
been
entitled
under
the...
the
factual
prong
that...
that
the
washington
courts
use
on
lesser
and
greater
offenses.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
i
think
that
if
the
parties
litigate
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
an
assault
with...
with
a
firearm,
as
opposed
to
litigate
the
offense
of
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon,
and
then
there's
merely
an
omission
from
the
elements,
i
think
that's
a
different
case.
but
i
don't--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--i
think
it's
a
materially--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--i
think
that
scenario
would
be
closer
to
neder,
but
i
think
that's
a
different
scenario
than
what
we
have
here.
and
i
think
the
reason
why
it's
different
here
is
because
the
jury
returned...
under
washington
law,
returned
a
complete
verdict.
there
is
no...
there
was
no
error
in
either
the
verdict
or
in
the
jury
instructions
as
a--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--in
that
scenario,
if
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
as...
as
perhaps
it
was
in
neder,
one
might
assume
that
the
error
is
uncontroverted.
but--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--because
i
think
unlike
neder
this
case
involves
a
jury...
or
excuse
me...
the...
a...
the
wrong
entity
has
determined
the
defendant's
guilt
not
on
the
crime
at
issue--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--because
in
a
scenario
where
the
jury
has
been
properly
instructed
and
has
returned
a
complete
verdict--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--i
think
that
scenario
is
closer
to
neder
than
it
is
to
this
case.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
i
think
it
matters
because
in
a
scenario
like
this,
as
opposed
to
either
neder
or...
or
the
hypothetical,
the
only
offense
that
has
ever
been
litigated
to
the
parties...
or
by
the
parties
to
the
jury
was
the
lesser
offense.
the
parties
understood
that
only
the
lesser
offense
was
at
issue,
and
we
know
that
because
in
response
to
mr.
recuenco's
motion
to
vacate,
the
state
told
the
judge
you
aren't
required
to
give
the
firearm
instruction
because
that's
not
an
element
of
either
the
substantive
charge
or
the
enhancement.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
because,
again,
i
go
back
to
washington
law.
and
the
fact
that
handgun
is
alleged
in
the
information
does
not
establish
that
it's
a
firearm
because
a
handgun--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--it
is.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
that
may
be,
but
as
a
matter
of
washington
law,
that's
not
the
case.
and
it
may
defy
common
sense,
but
that's
what
it
does.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
if,
in
fact,
the
allegation
of
handgun
is
sufficient
to
bring
it
in
the
context
of
neder,
then
there...
there
was
no
error
at
all.
there
would
not
have
been
a
blakely
violation
in
this
case.
and
the
wrong...
the
state
was
wrong
all
along
to
concede
that
there
was
because
apprendi
doesn't
just
involve...
doesn't
just
say
that
sentencing
elements
are
the
equivalent
of
elements
in
the
traditional
sense.
it
says
they're
the
equivalent
of
elements
of
a
greater
offense.
and
the
state
concedes
and
the
washington
supreme
court
has
found
that,
in
fact,
there
was
a
blakely
violation
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
that's
because
the
judge,
as
opposed
the
jury--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--decided
mr.
recuenco's
guilt
on
a
greater
offense.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
so...
so
as
a
matter
of
washington
law,
mr.
recuenco's
jury
was
properly
charged
and
properly
returned
a
verdict
on
the
only
offense
litigated
and
that
was
the
lesser
offense
of
assault
two
with
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
what
i
mean
by
saying
it
wasn't
litigated
is
that
it
was
the
understanding
of
the
parties
at
trial
that
the
firearm
element
was
not
at
issue
because
that
had
not
been
charged,
that
that
was
not
the
charge
in
front
of
the
jury.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
again,
i
could
point
to
the...
the
prosecutor's
response
in
the
motion
to
vacate.
i
can
point
to
the
court's
judgment
and
sentence,
which
i
don't
have
the
cite
for
right
off
the...
my
head,
but
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
on
that
form,
as
is
common
in
washington,
there
are
two
boxes
for
the
court
to
check.
one
says
that
a
verdict
regarding
a
deadly
weapon...
or
excuse
me...
that
a
firearm
other
than
a
deadly
weapon
was
returned.
the
other
says
that
a...
a...
excuse
me.
one
says
that
a
verdict
form
for
finding
that
the
person
was
armed
with
a
firearm
was
returned.
the
other
says
that
it
was
merely
the
verdict
form
for
being
armed
with
a
deadly
weapon
other
than
the
firearm.
the
trial--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--i
think
it's...
it
would
be
equally
inconsistent
with
the
state's
current
position
if
we
look
at
ja
35
where
the
prosecutor's
response
was
we
didn't
need
that
instruction
because
firearm
was
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
well,
it's
interesting
because
post
recuenco,
after
the
washington
supreme
court's
ruling
in
this
case,
yes,
that
would
be
an
error
because
after
the
washington
supreme
court's
decision
in
this
case,
what
they
said
is
that--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--as
a
matter
of
constitutional
error,
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would
have
been.
but
as...
but
under
washington
law,
it
was
a
verdict
they
couldn't...
as
we
know
from
recuenco
now,
it's
a
verdict
they
couldn't
have
returned.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
under
washington
law,
when
a
court...
as
i
think
is
common
under
federal
law,
whenever
a
court
interprets
a
statute,
determines
what
it
means,
that
is
what
the
statute
has
always
mean...
means,
and...
and
that
is
what
that
statute
will
mean
in
the
future
until
such
time
as
the
legislature
amends
it.
as
of
this
date,
while
the...
the
legislature
has
amended
the
statutes
at
issue
in
hughes,
it
has
done
nothing
with
respect
to
this
statute.
so,
as
it
stands
now,
based
on
the
recognition
of
the
washington
supreme
court
that
at
the
time
of
the
entry
of
that
decision,
there
was
no
provision
to
submit
that
question
to
a
jury
in
mr.
recuenco's
case.
there
was
also
no
provision
to
submit
it
to
a
jury
in
another
case
because
prior
to
recuenco,
the
only
means
by
which
the
firearm
enhancement
could
be
obtained
was
pursuant
to
the
decisions
in
meggyesy,
rai,
and
olney.
and
that
was
the
very
manner
that
was
used
here,
and
that
was
the
very
procedure
that
the
washington
supreme
court
found
violative
of
blakely.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
well,
that's
an
interesting
twist
under
washington
law
because
deadly
weapon
is...
is
actually
two
elements
of
assault
two.
under
the
substantive
offense,
it's
a
component
of...
of
assault,
and
also
an
element
of
the...
but
to
allege
a
firearm,
it
is
possible
that
the
substantive
offense
could
have
been
elevated
to
assault
one.
it's
also
possible
that
it
could
have
simply
been
an
assault
two
with
a
firearm
enhancement.
so--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--no.
and...
and
i
think
this
illustrates
a
point.
under
washington
law,
the
state
could
charge
assault
three
with
a
firearm
enhancement
in...
in
a
case
in
which
a
person
used
a
gun.
there's
nothing
under
washington
law
that
requires
the
prosecutor
to
charge
the
greatest
offense.
there's
nothing
under
federal
constitutional
law
that
even
if
that
greater
offense
is
charged,
that
the
jury
must
return
a
verdict
on
that
greater
offense.
in
fact,
the
jury,
as
the
circuit
breaker
in
the
system,
has
always...
always
has
the
right,
regardless
of
the
strength
of
the
evidence
and
regardless
of...
of
what
the
trial
court
view
as
the
correctness
of
the
charge,
to
return
the
verdict
on
the
lesser.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
i
think
this
court's
jurisprudence
on...
on
questions
of...
of
lenity
and
interpreting
jury
verdicts
would
allow
a
jury
to
return
a
verdict
that...
that
isn't
necessarily
supported
by
the
evidence.
it's
the
understanding
that
it's
their--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--i
don't
think
this
court
requires
that
the
jury...
but
i
think
what...
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
i
guess,
is
that
it
requires...
not
requires.
it...
it
imposes
deference
on
the
trial
courts
that
they
cannot
second
guess
the
jury,
that
because
the
jury
is
always
free
to
return
a
verdict
on
the
lesser
offense,
there
simply
cannot
be
a
situation
in
which
the
trial
court,
based
on
its
own
assessment
of
the
facts,
gets
to
enter
the
greater.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
i
think
in
neder...
neder
is
a
different
case
and
for
a
number
of
reasons.
unlike
neder,
there
has
never
been
a
claim
that
there's
any
incorrectness
in
either
the
verdict
in
the
charge
or
in
the
jury
instructions.
in
fact,
mr.
recuenco
from
the
outset
had
no
reason
to
suggest
that
there
was
anything
wrong
because
the
state
was
free
to
charge
him
with
the
lesser
offense,
and
they
did.
there
would
be
no
motive
on
his
part
to
say,
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
think
i'm
really
guilty
of
a
greater
offense.
please
ask
the
state
to
amend
its
information.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
it's
assault
in
the
second
degree
with
the
additional
deadly
weapon
enhancement.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
again,
had--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--i
think
if
the
information
and...
and
the
instructions
were
read
in
that
manner,
the
state
was
wrong
to
concede
that
there
was
blakely
error
here
at
all
because,
if
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
handgun
is
automatically
a
firearm,
there
would
have
been
no
blakely
violation
at
all.
but
that's
not
the
case.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
i'm
not
sure
i
can
answer
right...
i
believe
the
instruction
mentioned
handgun.
the
instruction--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--no,
it
did
not.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
but
again,
if...
if
under
washington
law,
a
handgun
were
automatically
a
firearm,
the
instruction
wasn't
erroneous
at
all.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
but
the
instructions
for
use
of
the
special
verdict
form
would
not
have
been.
and...
and
it's
because
of
that...
that
quirk
in
washington
law...
and
the
state
offered
us
some
suggestion
of
why
that
quirk
exists.
the
deadly
weapon
provisions
have
been
a
part
of
the
washington
sentencing
scheme
since
its
enactment
in
the
mid-'80's.
it
was
only
about
10
years
later
that
the
additional
enhancements
for
firearm
were
added,
and...
and
they
were
enacted
by...
by
a
citizens
initiative.
and
there's
very
little
reference
between
the
two
of
them.
but
they
still
exist
together
because
there's
nothing
that
suggests,
again,
that
the
state
couldn't
allege
the
lesser
offense
even
where
a
handgun
is...
is
involved
because
it
is
the
difference
between
a
handgun
with
nothing
more
and
a
handgun
that
has
the
capacity
to
fire.
and
it's
that
additional
component
of
capacity
to
fire
that
truly
creates
the
greater
and
lesser
offense
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
capacity
to
fire
does
not
mean
per
se
operability.
it...
it
means
that
this
instrument
has
the
capacity
to
fire
whether
or
not--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--an...
an
unloaded
gun
could
be
a
firearm
so
long
as
it
has
the
capacity
to
fire.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
the...
the
citation
to
what
is
now--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--.310
is...
is
the
definition
of
deadly
weapon.
the
other
one...
excuse
me....125--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--that
includes
both
the
firearm...
the
additional
time
for
firearm
enhancement,
as
well
as
the
time
for
the
deadly
weapon
enhancement.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
it...
it
cites
both,
depending
on
what
subsection
it's
citing.
so
it
doesn't
necessarily
identify
one
as
opposed
to
the
other.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
it
is
in
that...
that
statute,
yes.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
as
is
consistent
with
washington
law,
it's
read
to
the
jury
at...
at
the
outset,
but
it...
it
would
be
inconsistent,
i
think,
with
practice
in
washington
to
have
actually
submitted
the...
the
information
to
the
jury.
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
the
wrong
entity
has
determined
a
person's
guilt,
despite
the
jury's
complete
verdict
on
a
lesser
offense,
the
application
of
harmless
error
simply
eviscerates
what
blakely
sought
to
draw
as
the
limits...
or
excuse
me...
as
the...
as
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
jury's
right.
and
in
fact,
it...
it's
the
equivalent
of
a
second
sixth
amendment
violation
because
in
each
instance,
the
jury's
complete
verdict
on
the
lesser
offense
is
being
set
aside.
in
the
first
instance,
it's
based
on
the
trial
court's
review
of...
of
the
strength
of
the
evidence,
and
in
the
second
instance,
it's
based
on
the...
the
appellate
court's
review
of
the
strength
of
the
record
to
support
not
the
jury's
verdict,
but
instead
the
trial
court's
assessment
of
the
proper
charge.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
it
assumes,
i
think,
that...
that
the...
it
assumes
the
correctness
of
the
judge's...
of
the
trial
court's
assessment
of
the
facts
rather
than
simply
accept
the...
the
jury's
verdict
for
what
it
was
because,
again,
as
a
matter
of
washington
law,
mr.
recuenco
could
be
found
guilty
of
assault
two
with
a
deadly
weapon
even
if
he
used
what
appeared
to
be
a
handgun,
absent
some
proof
of
capacity.
and
again,
as
a
matter
of...
of
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence,
even
had
the
state
put
together
evidence
establishing
the
capacity
of
the
instrument
to
fire,
the
jury
would
have
been
free
to
return
a
verdict
on
the
lesser
offense
of
deadly
weapon,
even
if
it
were
to
contradict
washington
law
on
that
point.
the
jury
would--
mr.
gregory
c.
link
--but...
but,
again,
in
neder,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
the
offense
that
was
litigated
to
it
and
based
on
the
parties'
understanding
of
what
offense
was
at
issue.
in
this
case,
that
doesn't
happen.
and,
again,
it's
illustrated
by
the
prosecutor's
response
to
mr.
recuenco's
motion
to
vacate,
and
it's
illustrated
by
the
court's
judgment
and
sentence,
which
is
at
page
14
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
it
specifically
finds
that
the
only
verdict...
and...
and
again,
doesn't
question
the
verdict...
that
the
only
verdict
returned
was
deadly
weapon
other
than
a
firearm.
it
doesn't
assume
that
the
jury
found
that
it
was
the
firearm
verdict.
it
doesn't
make
that
assumption.
it
recognizes
that
verdict
for
what
it
was.
based
on
then
existing
washington
law,
which
recuenco
overturned,
it
concluded
it
had
to
impose
the
firearm
enhancement.
so
there's
no
suggestion
by
either
of
the
parties
or
the
trial
court
or
the
washington
supreme
court,
for
that
matter,
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
jury
returning
a
verdict
of
deadly
weapon
because,
as
a
matter
of
washington
law
and
as
recognized
by
each
of
those...
those
entities,
the
jury...
the
jury
could
do
that,
and
they
did.
refusing
to
apply
harmless
error
in
this
case
doesn't
require
a
single
retrial
of
a
single
individual.
unlike
the
normal
case,
unlike
neder
itself,
in...
in
those
cases,
had
harmless
error
not
applied,
the
defendants
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
that's
not
true
after
blakely.
at
best,
what
would
happen
is...
is
defendants
would
be
remanded
back
to...
to
the
various
trial
courts
for
the
reentry
of
the
sentence
that's
supported
by
the...
the
jury's
verdict.
there
will
be
no
need
to
conduct
new
trials.
there
will
be
no
need
to
do
anything,
other
than
that
simple
ministerial
act.
there
simply
is
no
prudential
reason.
there
won't
be
the
flood
of...
of
retrials
or...
or
the
prison
doors
thrown
open
for...
for
people
to
walk
free
with
no
convictions.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
as
it
exists
now
and
based
on
the
washington
supreme
court's
decision
in
hughes
and
recuenco,
those
individuals
sentenced
before
the
washington
legislature
amended
the
act
would
simply
be
entitled
to
have
their
cases
remanded
back
for
entry
of
a
conviction
based
on
the
jury's
verdict.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
i...
i
certainly
don't.
mr.
gregory
c.
link
and
both
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy
and
as
a
matter
of
washington
law,
i
don't
think
that...
that
would...
could
occur.
the
washington
supreme
court
correctly
held
that
harmless
error
analysis
could
not
apply
where
the
trial
court
has
set
aside
the
jury's
complete
verdict
on
a
lesser
offense
in
favor
of
a
judgment
on
the
greater,
both
as
a
matter
of
state
and
federal
law.
and
mr.
recuenco
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
that
decision.
