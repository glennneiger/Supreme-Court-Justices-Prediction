was
deadly
weapon
still
an
enhancement
at
that
point,
or
was
deadly
weapon
part
of
the
definition
of
a
new
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
you
could...
it
could
be
argued
that
it
not
only
didn't
encompass
the
firearm
finding,
but
it
excluded
the
firearm
finding.
if,
as
you
tell
us,
there
are
two
categories,
one
being
deadly
weapon,
which
does
not
include
firearm,
and
the
other
being
firearm,
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
jury
verdict
positively
contradicted?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
find
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
does
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what...
what
you
meant
by
a
facial
unconstitutional...
facially
unconstitutional
problem.
you
mean
a
federal
court
would
enjoin
the
criminal
prosecution
because
it's
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
we
wouldn't
say
that,
would
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
neither
can
i.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that...
that's
not
really
an
adequate
answer,
that
it
would
facially
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
it
be
lesser
included
when,
as
we've
heard,
firearm
does...
i'm
sorry...
deadly
weapon
does
not
include
firearm?
if
deadly
weapon
included
firearm,
then
certainly...
i'm
sorry...
deadly
weapon
would...
would...
could
be
a
lesser
included
offense
somehow.
but
the
two
are
exclusive
categories,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
it
has
the
capacity--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
whisman,
can
i...
can
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
which
i
think
puts
in
starker
form
what
the...
what
your
colleague
here
says
this
case
involves?
suppose
that...
that
you
have
a
statute,
a
murder
statute,
which
applies
the
murder
of
a
single
individual,
but...
but
you
have
another
statute
with
a
death
penalty
called
aggravated
murder.
and
it's
a
different
crime
and
it...
it
requires
the...
the
killing
of
more
than
one
person
in...
in
the
same...
in
the
same
event.
let's
assume
a
trial
in
which
somebody
came
into
a
bank
with
a
machine
gun.
only
one
person
came
in,
and
five
people
were
killed.
but
the
prosecution
only
brought
a
prosecution
for
simple
murder.
okay?
and
the
jury
comes
back
with
a
verdict
for...
for
simple
murder.
certainly
a
judge
would
not
be
able
to
say,
well,
no
jury
could
possibly
have
found
simple
murder
here
without
also
thinking
that
this
person
was
guilty
of...
of
this
greater
offense
of...
of
aggravated
murder
and,
therefore,
i'm
going
to
enter
a
judgment
of
aggravated
murder.
that's
what
the...
the
defense
says
happened
here,
that
there
was
just
a
verdict
of...
of
the
lesser
offense.
that's
all
the
jury
found.
it
could
have
found
more
and
maybe...
maybe
in
finding
that,
it...
it
must
have
thought
that
the
greater
offense
also
existed,
but
it
never
came
in
with
a
verdict
for
the
greater
offense.
now,
tell
me
why
what
happened
here
is
different
from...
from
the
hypothetical.
