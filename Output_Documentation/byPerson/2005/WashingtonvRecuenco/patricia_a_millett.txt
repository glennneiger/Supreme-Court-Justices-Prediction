ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
neder,
this
court
held
that
the
failure
to
submit
an
element
to
a
jury...
an
element
of
a
crime
to
a
jury
is
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis
because
it
is
a
nonstructural
trial
error.
in
apprendi
and
blakely,
this
court
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
jury
recognizes
no
distinction
between
elements
that
set
a
maximum
punishment,
sentencing
elements,
and
elements
of
the
underlying
offense.
for
that
reason,
the
failure
to
submit
an
element
that
sets
the
sentence
to
the
maximum
sentence
available
should
be
subject
to
exact
same
harmless
error
analysis
that
was
applied
in
neder.
the
exact
same
constitutional
value
and
constitutional
right
is
at
stake.
the
exact
same
analysis
of
the
effects
of
the
error
will
be
applied
by
the
court,
and
the
same
sort
of
discrete
error
in
time
that
you
had
in
neder.
there's
no
functional
distinction
between
neder.
in
addition,
in
schriro
v.
summerlin,
this
court
held
that
the
failure
to
submit
a
sentencing
element
to
a
jury
is
not
the
type
of
error
that
calls
into
question
the
fairness,
accuracy,
or
reliability
of
the
underlying
proceeding.
in
cotton,
this
court
held
that
that
same
type
of
error
does
not
impugn
the
integrity,
public
reputation,
or
fairness
of
judicial
proceedings.
and
in
mitchell--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
true,
justice
stevens,
that
there
will
be
times...
i
don't
think
this
is
one
of
those
cases,
but
there
will
be--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
it
will
depend
on
whether
the
evidence
was
disputed
before
the
judge
in
a...
in
a...
in
the
federal
system
would
have
been
sentencing
hearing.
and
remember,
sometimes--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--exactly.
exactly,
justice
scalia.
there's
not
only...
there
may
be
disputed
evidence,
but
the
standard
may
be
different.
it's
not
clear
whether
it
was
here,
but
at
least
as
to
some
factors.
it's
clearly
not
enough
that
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
judge's
determination.
the
question
would
be
whether
there's
any...
a
jury
could
have
found
any
doubt
or
when
it's
clear
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
the
same.
but
i
do
think
in
a
case
like
this,
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
it's...
this
case
illustrates
that
these
things
are
not
categorically
or
necessarily
unamenable
to
harmless
error
review.
and
in
fact,
what
would
happen
in
cases
like
this
and
a
lot
in
the
federal
system,
where
you
have
undisputed,
uncontested
facts...
and
we
know
that
because
they
had
the
incentive
to
contest
them
at
a
sentencing
proceeding.
and
so
to
hold
that
automatic
reversal
is
required
would
mean
it
would
go
back
for
a
retrial
that
would
have
nothing
to
do...
nothing
to
do
with
the
element
that
was
not
decided
by
the
jury.
that
would
be
undisputed.
there's
not
going
to
be
any
contest
back
here
that
the
firearm,
the
semi
automatic
that
was
handed
to
the
jury
loaded
and
passed
around
to
the
jury,
was
a
firearm.
it
would
just
be
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
to
contest
things
that
were
decided
properly
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
the
jury,
consistent
with
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
it's
not,
justice
souter.
first
of
all,
the
hughes
opinion
on
which
they
rely
is
crystal
clear
that
the
only
thing
the
court
found
was
that
there
was
no
procedure
to
re
empanel
a
jury
on
remand.
and
i
point
the
court
to
page
208...
that's
a
p.
3d
citation
and
149
in
the
washington
reporter
citation...
where
the
court
specifically
said,
we
are
only
talking
about
remand
and
not
deciding
whether
these
things
could
ever
be
submitted
to
a
jury
in
the
first
instance.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
that's
right,
but
even
if
it
weren't,
if...
if
you
had
some
state
that
decided
not
to
fix
its
law,
in
light
of
apprendi
and
blakely,
i
expect
that
what
would
happen
is
defendants
would
bring
sort
of...
there
would
be
a
facial
constitutionality
problem
with
any
attempt
to
prosecute
under
that.
and
that
may
be
the
way
to
deal
with
it.
there's
no
question
of
willfulness
here.
this
is
decided
at
a
time
when,
in
good
faith,
pre
apprendi
even...
this
isn't
even
the
apprendi/blakely
window...
that
it
was
acceptable
to
have
this
sort
of
two
tier
proceedings
much
like
we
are
used
to
in
sort
of
a
death
penalty
context.
and
there's...
there's
been
no...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
can't
imagine
the
federal
court
would
intervene
in
an
ongoing
state
proceeding.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
state
courts
are
perfectly
capable
of...
of
applying
and
we
assume
that
they
would
apply
and
adhere
to
constitutional
law
from
this
court.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
my
understanding
was
that
the
washington
law...
washington
legislature
didn't
amend
its
law
to
say
that
this
could
be
submitted
to
a
jury.
and
then
every
defendant
at
the
outset
of
the
case,
would
say
you
need
to,
you
know,
strike
the
indictment,
dismiss
this
charge--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
i
think
there
would
be
a
way...
i'm...
i'm
confident
there
would
be
a
way
to
deal
with
it.
and
i
don't
think
the
way
to
deal
with
it
is
to
assume
that
that's
a
reason
to
make
harmless
error
not
available
to
these
types
of
errors
across
the
board.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
they
would,
and
i
think
that's
not
a
fair
assumption
and
it's
certainly
not
the
way
to
decide
whether
harmless
error
analysis
should
apply.
i
mean,
blakely
has
been
on
the
books
for
a
couple
of
years.
neder
has
been
out
there
for
7
years,
and
we
haven't
seen
people
deliberately
trying
to
get
around
people's
sixth
amendment
rights.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
that's
required
by
washington
law.
the
jury--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
the...
it's
assault
in
the
second
degree
which
requires...
itself
requires
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
so
it
wouldn't
even
be
assault
in
the
second
degree
under
washington
law
without
the
jury
finding
a
deadly
weapon.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there
had...
there
had
to
be
a
deadly
weapon
to
have
assault
in
the
second
degree,
and
then...
and
i
may
not
get
all
the
nuances
of
washington
law,
but
then
the
jury
had
to
have
the
sentencing
enhancement,
had
to
make
a
separate
finding
that
the
defendant
was
armed
with
a
deadly
weapon
at
the
time.
i'm
not
sure,
again,
if
it's
essentially
redundant
in
second
degree
assault
cases
or
not.
it's
a
little
confusing.
but
the...
the
law
required
that
you
find
a
deadly
weapon
but
it
wasn't
which
deadly
weapon.
it
was
just
a
baseline
eligibility,
and
then
it
was
up
to
the
court
to
decide
which
deadly
weapon
which
would
then
dictate
the
sentence.
and
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
clear
is
there's
been
some
argument
that
this
case
is
different
from
neder
because
you
have
a
completed
defense.
that
is
no
different
at
all.
you
had
a
completed
verdict
for
a
non
offense
in
neder,
and
the
distinction
between
a
judge
making
findings
that
make
a
verdict
that
support
a
non
offense
into
offense
is
not
one
that
makes
a
structural
difference.
and
in
carella
v.
california,
rose
v.
clark,
you
had
elements
that
stood
on
the
fault
line
between
lesser
included
offenses
and
greater
included
offenses.
now,
they
weren't
missing...
they
weren't
technically
missing
elements,
but
they
were
elements
that
were
subject
to
mandatory
presumptions
by
the
jury.
and
yet,
this
court
said
that
they're
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis.
now,
obviously,
the
type
of
the
element
is
going
to
affect
the
government's
ability
to
prevail
under
harmless
error
analysis,
and
there
may
well
be
times
when
the
government
will
not
succeed
in
that
process,
especially
as
you
get
elements
that
are
more
central
to,
you
know,
the...
the
crime
and...
and
traditional
elements
like
the
intent
issues
that
were
at
issue
in
both
carella
and
in
rose
v.
clark.
the
other
point
i
wanted...
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the
fact
that
the
jury
verdict
form
here
came
back
consistent
with...
with
the...
or
the
jury
verdict
form
in
neder
came
back
with
the
completed
crime
shouldn't
make
a
difference.
the
change
in
the...
that
jury
verdict
only
came
back
because
of
a
second
mistake.
the
jury
was
wrongly
and
mistakenly
told
that
if
it
found
elements
a,
b,
and
c,
it
would...
it
would
establish
a...
a
completed
crime.
the
fact
that
in
this
case
you
don't
have
that
second
error
isn't
again
a
difference
that
makes
one
error
structural
and
the
other
nonstructural.
the
important
thing
is
that
the
right
is
the
same.
the
cost...
the
right
to
the
same,
the
ability
of
courts
to
analyze
this
error
is
the
same.
and
on
the
other
hand,
a
rule
of
automatic
reversal
will
impose
an
enormous
cost
on
victims
and
the
public.
thank
you.
