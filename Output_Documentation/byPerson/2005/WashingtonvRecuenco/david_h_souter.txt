justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
the
deadly
weapon...
the
definition
of
deadly
weapon...
that
that
could
include
a
revolver
or
a
pistol.
you...
you
seem
to
be
describing
now
deadly
weapon.
that's
one
thing,
and
that
excludes
guns.
and
then
firearm,
a
discrete
category.
but
i
thought
that
deadly
weapon
includes
at
least
pistols
and
revolvers.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
didn't
the
deadly
weapon...
definition
of
deadly
weapon
include
firearms?
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--now,
did
you
have
to
prove
that
because,
as...
as
i
have
assumed,
the
charge
included
the
statement
that
he
had
used
a
handgun?
was
that
the
term
used?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
do
we
do
about
the
problem
that
is
raised
by...
by
counsel
on
the
other
side,
that
washington
law
is
such...
or
at
least
at
the
time
the
briefs
were
written,
washington
law
is
such,
as
they
understand
it,
that
the...
that
the
issue
could
never
properly
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury,
and...
and
therefore,
if...
if
washington
courts
are
going
to
follow
washington
law,
in
every
case
in
which
a
firearm
is
an
issue,
the
case
is
going
to
be
handled
exactly
like
this?
it's
not...
the
firearm
issue
is
not
going
to
the
jury.
the
firearm
determination
will
be
made
by
the
judge.
if
the
state
of
washington
decides
not
to
amend
its
law,
we
would
have
a
situation
in
which,
in
effect,
apprendi
is
read
out
of
the...
the
constitutional
law
simply
by
state
procedure.
and
in
every
case,
the...
the
response
would
have
to
be
harmless
error
analysis
on
your
theory.
that
is
a
pretty
neat
way
to
undercut
apprendi.
is
that
not
a
good
reason
to
say
we
shouldn't
have
harmless
error
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're...
i'm
sorry.
you're
saying
their
argument
is
wrong,
in
effect,
as
a...
as
a
statement
of
washington
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
a
motion
in
limine
kind
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there...
there
is
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
find
that
it
was
a
real
gun,
and
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
to
the
contrary,
that
is
competent
evidence
for
the
jury
to
use
in
concluding
that
it
would
function
like
a
real
gun.
it's
not...
they
didn't
have
to
put
in
further
technical
evidence.
an
issue
might
have
been
raised.
i
mean,
your...
the...
the
defendant
might
have
come
up
and...
and
presented
evidence
to
the
effect
that
it
was
only
a
starter
pistol,
in
which
case,
okay,
there
would
be
a
real
issue.
but
in
the
absence
of
any
reason
to
doubt
that
the
handgun
was
what
it
purported
to
be,
there
would
be
no
reason
to...
there
would
be
no
requirement
of
further
evidence
about
functionality,
would
there
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's...
what's
your
authority?
i
mean,
that
doesn't
seem...
as
a
matter
of
factual
common
sense,
that
doesn't
seem
required.
is...
is
there
a
washington
case
that
requires
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
exactly
in
the
language
is
it
that
you
hang
your
hat
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
no...
no
question.
but
if
there...
but
if
there
is
no
reason
to
question
its
apparent
functionality,
i
mean,
you
know,
it's
a
handgun.
it
looks
like
a
handgun.
somebody
is
holding
it
like
a
handgun...
there...
there
is
no
reason,
it
seems
to
me,
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
based
on
the
statute
to
doubt
that
it
would
be
functional.
and
therefore,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
proof
would
be
competent
that
it
was
a
functioning
handgun
in
the
absence
of
any
question
raised.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
it's
also
the
case,
as
i
understand
it,
and
as
counsel
on
the
other
side
confirmed
a
few
moments
ago,
that
the
charge
specifically
specified
that
a
handgun
had
been
used.
so
this
is
not
a
case,
as
i
think
you
were
suggesting,
in
which
there
has
never
been
a
charge
of
the
offense
plus
the
enhancement
they
now
claim.
the...
the
problem
was
in
the
jury
verdict,
not
in
the
charge,
not
in
notice
to
the
defendant.
and
if
that's
the
case,
why
isn't
it
just
like
neder?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
a...
a
firearm,
as
i
understand
it,
is
defined
to
include
a
pistol
or
a
revolver.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
isn't
the
natural
reading
of...
or
understanding
of
the
word
handgun
that
it's
a
pistol
or
a
revolver?
i
mean,
isn't
that
what
people
would
normally
take
it
to
mean?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you're
asking
for
a...
you're
asking
for
a
federal
constitutional
ruling,
and
right
now,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you're
arguing
that
you
ought
to
win
because
if
you
don't
win,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
we
would
be
condoning
a
verdict
for
an
offense
that
was
never
charged.
but
if,
in
fact,
handgun
is
properly
read,
properly
understood
to
mean
a
pistol
or
a
revolver,
and
that's
what
a
firearm...
that's...
that's
what
a
firearm
is...
is
defined
to
include
under
washington
law,
then
in
fact
the
offense
has
been
charged.
the
enhancement
has
been
charged.
and
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
it
seems
to
me
that
ought
to
be
enough
to
bring
it
within
neder
regardless
of
what
the
quirks
of
washington
law
may
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
because
it...
it
didn't
go
to
the
jury.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
you
say
it's
not
litigated,
do
you
mean
simply
that
nobody,
none
of
the
witnesses,
none
of
the
counsel
in
argument,
disputed
that
a
handgun
was
there?
in
other
words,
it
was
just
one
of
those
things
everybody
understood.
is
that
what
you
mean
when
you
say
it
wasn't
litigated?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
what
do
you...
what
do
you
base
that
statement
on?
in
other
words,
i...
i
think
you're
now
arguing
that
the
understanding
was
that
although
it
looked
as
though
the...
the
most
serious
enhancement
had
been
charged,
the
understanding
of
the
parties
was
that
it
had
not
been.
if
that's
your
argument,
what
is
your
basis
for
saying
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
we
accept...
going
back
to
our
earlier
exchange,
if
we
accept
the
proposition
that
charging
that
he
used
a
handgun
was
sufficient
to
charge
a
firearm,
then
the
charge
against
him
was
assault
in
the
second
degree
with
the
maximum
enhancement
for
use
of
a
firearm.
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
and
i
may
disagree
on...
on
how
to
read...
how
to
understand
firearm,
but
if
you
read
it
the
way
i
just
suggested,
then
the
charge
was
assault
two
with
the
maximum
enhancement.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
the...
i
thought
the
reason
they
conceded
the
blakely
violation
was
that
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury,
the
instruction
only
went
to
deadly
weapon
and
the
instruction
did
not
specifically
refer
to
firearm.
i
thought
that's
why
they...
they
stipulated
that
there
was
a
blakely
error.
as
a
matter
of
the
fact
about
the
instruction,
is...
is
my
description
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
and
it
didn't...
it
didn't
use
the...
let's
put
it
this
way.
it
didn't
use
the
word
firearm.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
why
they
conceded
a
blakely
error.
