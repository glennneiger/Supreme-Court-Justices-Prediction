chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
washington
v.
recuenco.
mr.
whisman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
jury
given
a
copy
of
the
information?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
assumption
of
the
hypothetical
is,
i
take
it,
that
the
washington
state
judges
would
deliberately
violate
our
holding
of
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
in
imposing
the
enhancement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
mr.
link.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
asked
for
an
instruction
on
the
lesser
offense
of
aiming
a
firearm.
under
that
provision
of
washington
law,
does
the
firearm
have
to
be
operable
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
ask
for
an
instruction
assuming
that
the
firearm
at
issue
in
this
case
was
operable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
the
firearm
were
not
operable,
you
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
a
jury
instruction
on
the
lesser
offense
of
aiming
a
firearm.
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what
your
trial
counsel
said
was
that
the...
i'm
quoting
from
the
joint
appendix,
page
30...
the
allegation
and
the
basis
on
which
this
case
was
tried
was
under
the
theory
of
firearm.
it
seems
inconsistent
with
your
representation
that
nobody
had
an
idea
that
they
were
trying
this
under
the
theory
of
a
firearm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
millett
tells
us
that
that
only
applies
on
remand
under...
under
the
hughes
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't...
isn't
that
true
in
neder
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
special
verdict
form
still
was.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
do
you
know
if
the
information
went
to
the
jury
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
other
way
of
looking
at
it
is
it's
based
on
trying
to
understand
what
the
jury
meant
when
it
said
deadly
weapon
when
the
only
evidence
of
a
deadly
weapon
they
were
presented
was
a
firearm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
in
neder,
even
if
the
jury
had
been
asked
to
rule
on
materiality,
it
could
have
decided
not
to
rule
according
to
the
evidence.
the
same
argument
applies
in
neder.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
whisman,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
those
are
the
sort
of
considerations
that
can
be
taken
into
account
under
harmless
error
analysis.
right?
the
absence
of
notice,
the
prejudice.
i
would
have
put
on
this
evidence
if
i
had
known
i
was
accused
of
using
a
handgun.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
