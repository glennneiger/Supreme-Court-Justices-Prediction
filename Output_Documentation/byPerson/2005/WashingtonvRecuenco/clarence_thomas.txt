justice
clarence
thomas
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
no,
05-83,
washington
versus
recuenco.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
respondent
was
convicted
of
assault
in
the
second
degree,
based
on
the
jury’s
finding
that
he
assaulted
his
wife
with
a
deadly
weapon.
the
trial
court
then
applied
a
three-year
firearm
enhancement
to
respondent’s
sentence,
based
on
the
court’s
own
factual
finding
that
the
deadly
weapon
at
issue
was
a
firearm.
on
direct
appeal
to
the
washington
supreme
court,
the
state
conceded
that
this
enhancement
to
respondent’s
sentence
was
imposed
in
violation
of
our
decision
in
blakely
versus
washington,
but
argued
that
the
error
was
harmless.
the
washington
supreme
court
disagreed,
holding
that
blakely
errors
are
structural
in
nature
and,
thus,
can
never
be
harmless
and
vacated
respondent’s
sentence.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
most
constitutional
errors
are
subject
to
harmless-error
analysis.
an
error
is
structural
and
requires
automatic
reversal
only
when
it,
“necessarily
renders
a
criminal
trial
fundamentally
unfair
or
an
unreliable
vehicle
for
determining
guilt
or
innocence”.
in
neder
versus
united
states,
we
determined
that
a
trial
court’s
failure
to
require
a
jury
to
find
an
element
of
an
offense
was
not
structural
error.
this
case
is
controlled
by
neder.
the
only
difference
between
neder
and
this
case
is
that
in
neder
the
jury
failed
to
find
an
element
of
the
offense,
while
in
the
present
case
the
jury
failed
to
find
a
sentencing
factor.
in
apprendi
versus
new
jersey
we
recognized
that,
“any
possible
distinction
between
an
element
of
an
offense
and
a
sentencing
factor
was
unknown
to
the
practice
of
criminal
indictment,
trial
by
jury
and
judgment
by
jury
as
it
existed
during
the
year
surrounding
our
nation’s
founding”.
accordingly,
failure
to
prove
a
sentencing
factor
to
a
jury,
like
failure
to
prove
an
element
of
an
offense
to
a
jury,
is
not
structural
error.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
