justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on...
on
that
point,
i
have...
i
have
one
question.
at
page
3a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
washington
supreme
court's
opinion
is
set
forth,
and
in
the
course
of
that
opinion,
it
says,
to
the
contrary,
when
defense
counsel
argued
the
definition
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
prosecutor
explicitly
stated
that
the
method
under
which
the
state
is
alleging
and
the
jury
found
assault
was
committed
was
by
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
in
the
crime
charged
in
the
enhancement,
the
state
alleged
there
is
no
element
of
a
firearm.
the
element
is
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
i
don't...
this
was
at
the
sentencing
proceeding,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
because
i
couldn't
find
it
in
the
sentencing
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
sound
as
if
he
thinks
there
was...
the
prosecutor
thought
there
was
no
error.
a
deadly
weapon
is
a
deadly
weapon,
and
then--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
would
it
be
either
proper
or
required
by
the
washington
trial
court
to
tell
the
jury,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
the
charge
is
assault?
there
is
also
a
possibility
of
a
sentence
enhancement.
it's
a
1-year
enhancement
if
it's
a
deadly
weapon.
it's
a
3-year
enhancement
if
it's
a
firearm
and
a
pistol
is
a
firearm.
would
the
judge
err
if
he
did
that?
or
another
way
of
putting
the
same
question,
would
it
be
proper
for
the
judge
to
leave
out
the
1-year
deadly
weapon
instruction
and
just
instruct
you
can...
you
must
determine
whether
it's
an
assault
and
you
must
determine
whether
there's
a
3-year
enhancement
for
the
use
of
a
firearm?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
my
hypothetical
is
he
says
it's
a
3-year
enhancement
if
the
deadly
weapon
is
a
firearm.
that's...
what
i'm
asking
is,
in
effect,
under
washington
law,
is
it
error
if
the
judge
allows
the
definition
of
deadly
weapon
also
to
go
to
the
jury
so
they
can
find
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you're
saying
the
instruction
here
was
proper.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
in
this
case
that
the
court
did
have
the
obligation
to
submit
a
special
verdict
form
indicating
that
the
defendant...
asking
whether
the
defendant
was
armed
with
a
deadly
weapon?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
as
a
matter...
a
constitutional
matter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the...
suppose
the
judge
didn't
ask
about
deadly
weapon
at
all,
just...
just
asked
whether
there's
an
assault.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you...
so...
so
there
had
to
be
an
instruction
that
there
was
an
assault
in
the
second
degree?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
statute
does
say
deadly
weapon
other
than
a
firearm.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
enhancement
section
does.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
in
this
case
you'd
be
entitled
to
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
was
there
any
evidence
that
it
didn't
have
the
capacity
to
fire?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
not
entitled
to...
you're
not
entitled
to
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
for
which
there's
no
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
error
in
this
case
based
on
the
evidence
presented
and
the
way
the...
the
case
was
argued...
would
it
have
been
error
for
the
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
that
if
they
found
that
there
was
a
firearm
involved,
they
should
make
a...
they
could
make
a...
a
finding
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
as
a
constitutional
matter,
would
it
have
been
error
for
the
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
in
this
case,
based
on
this
evidence,
that
they
could
return
a
verdict
that
a
firearm
was
used
as
part
of
the
assault?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
regardless
of
the
strength
of
the
evidence.
how
about
no
evidence
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
requires
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
charging
document,
where
it
says
that
he
was
armed
with
a
deadly
weapon,
to
wit,
a
handgun,
and
then
it
cites
the
washington
statutes,
those
citations
include
the
3-year
enhancement
provision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
cites
rcw
9.994a.125
and
9.94a.310.
is
one
of...
is
one
of
those
the
3-year
enhancement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
9.94a.125.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
includes
the
3
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
does
include
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
take
it
washington
wouldn't
have
the
option...
suppose
that
you
prevail.
washington
doesn't
have
the
option
to
give
him
a
whole
new
trial,
do
they,
because
there's
been
double
jeopardy,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
i'm
saying,
you
don't
concede,
do
you,
that
washington
would
have
the
option
to
retry
him
to
try
to
obtain
the
3-year
enhancement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
under
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
aggravated
murder
is...
is
in
the
charging
documents,
but
the
judge
doesn't
say
aggravated
murder
when
he
submits
it
to
the
jury.
