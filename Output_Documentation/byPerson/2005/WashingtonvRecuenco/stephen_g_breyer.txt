justice
stephen
g.
breyer
take
justice
alito's
case,
and
nobody
litigated
it
because
nobody
doubted
that
it
was
a
loaded
gun.
now,
what's
the
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so...
so,
therefore,
it's
harmless.
so,
therefore,
we
use
harmless
error
analysis.
so
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
quite...
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
there
is
the
difference
that
in
the
alito
case
as
amended,
it
all
happened
before
the
jury
got
its
verdict.
in
our
case,
it
happened
after
the
jury
reached
a
verdict.
now,
absolutely
true.
and
my
question,
of
course,
is
why
does
that
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
it
was
improperly
instructed.
the
judge
forgot
to
give
this
instruction
about
the
nature
of
the
firearm.
i
take
it...
at
least
my
case...
the
judge
forgets
to
instruct
about
the
firearm.
he
just
forgets.
all
right?
and
then
the
jury
goes
out.
it
comes
back
and
the
lawyer
says,
judge,
i
handed
you
the
instruction.
why
didn't
you
give
it?
he
says,
oh,
my
god,
i
forgot.
now,
does
harmless
error
apply
to
that
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
want
to
know
why
that
matters
because
the
only
thing
i've
tried
to
create
the
hypothetical
to
matter
is
the
one
thing
happens
before
the
jury
goes
out,
and
the
other
happens
after.
and
why
does
that
matter?
