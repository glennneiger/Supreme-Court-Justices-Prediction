justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you...
could
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
have
it
in
mind
correctly.
is
it
correct
that
the
firearm
has
to
be
an
operable
firearm?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is...
just
again,
i'm
not
trying
to
find
out
the
answer
to
what
happened
here,
but
just
as
a
matter
of
what
the
law
provides.
is
it
conceivable
that
a...
a
gun
which
was
not
operable
could
nevertheless
be
a
deadly
weapon
because
it
can
be
used
as
a
club?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
millett,
can
i
ask
you
this
one
question?
would
there
ever
be
a
case
where
it
was
not
harmless
error
when
the
judge
makes
the
finding?
isn't
it...
wouldn't
it
be
reasonable
for
the
appellate
court
to
assume,
well,
if
the
judge
made
the
finding,
it's
probably
supported
by
the
evidence
and
presumably
the
jury
would
have
come
out
the
same
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
might
be
a
rare
case,
but
in
about
95
percent
of
the
cases,
wouldn't
it
be
true
that
the
fact
the
judge
made
the
finding
is
pretty
good
evidence
that
the
jury
would
have
made
the
same
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
link,
will
you
just...
maybe
i...
i
should
know
this,
but
the
information
charges
an
assault
in
the
second
degree
using
a
deadly
weapon.
if
they
had
charged
use
of
a
firearm
rather
than
a
deadly
weapon,
what
would
the
crime
have
been?
would
that
also
have
been
assault
in
the
second
degree?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
firearm
enhancement
itself
would
not
covert
it
from
second
degree
to
first
degree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one
other
thing?
capacity
to
fire
doesn't
mean
it
had
to
be
loaded,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
an
unloaded
gun
could
be
a
firearm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
we'd
have
justice
scalia's
case
if
this
information
left
out
the
words,
to
wit,
a
handgun.
