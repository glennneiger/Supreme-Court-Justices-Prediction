i
thought
that
that
could
apply
in
a
case
where
the
deadly
weapon
was
a
gun.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
explain
again
why
it
was
irrelevant
whether
the
gun
was
operable
or
not?
justice
ruth
bader

but
to
be
a
real
gun,
it
has
to
be
operable.
justice

but
all
that
the
jury
found
was
deadly
weapon
because
that's
all
they
were
asked
to
find.
justice
ruth
bader

the

they
charged
the
main
thing?
they
charged
me
with
deadly
weapon,
and
they
asked
the
jury
to
find
deadly
weapon.
