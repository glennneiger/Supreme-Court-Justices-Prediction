justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let's
say
a
new
case
comes
up
tomorrow
and
the
person
is
charged
in
an
information
with
assault
in
the
second
degree,
and
it's
clearly
alleged
in
the
information
that
a
firearm
was
used.
but
then
when
the
case
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
judge
just
forgets
to
charge
on
the
firearm
factor
or
element.
would
that...
could
that
be
harmless
error?
is
that
any
different
from
the
case
that's
before
us?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
it's
a
different...
is
it
a
materially
different
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
just
like
neder,
or
is
it
different
from
neder?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
keep
saying
a
lesser
offense
and
a
greater
offense,
but
under
washington
law,
there's
just
one
offense.
isn't
that
right?
it's
second...
it's
assault
in
the
second
degree.
