mr.
james
m.
whisman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
when
a
judge,
rather
than
a
jury,
decides
a
fact
that
increases
the
defendant's
punishment
above
the
applicable
standard
range,
the
sixth
amendment's
jury
trial
right
is
violated.
this
is
true
regardless
of
whether
the
fact
is
called
an
element
or
whether
it
is
called
a
sentencing
factor
because
elements
and
sentencing
factors
are
functionally
equivalent
under
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
it
follows
that
the
same
harmless
error
rule
that
applies
to
missing
or
misdescribed
elements
should
also
apply
to
missing
or
misdescribed
sentencing
enhancements.
in
a
series
of
washington
decisions,
the
washington
supreme
court
has
held
that
harmless
error
analysis
may
never
be
conducted
as
to
a
missing
or
misdescribed
sentencing
enhancement
simply
because
it
is
called
a
sentencing
enhancement.
this
rule
of
absolute
prohibition
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
should
be
corrected.
before
i
go
on,
however,
to
explain
the
legal
basis
and
the
flaws
in
the
legal
reasoning
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court,
i
would
like
to
take
a
brief
moment
to
address
a
few
state
law
issues
that
have
been
raised
by
the
respondent's
brief.
the
first
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
at
all
in
washington
we
can,
at
present,
seek
deadly
weapon
enhancements
or,
more
specifically,
firearm
enhancements.
it
was
alleged
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
we
cannot,
and
i'd
just
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
authority
in
washington
for
that
proposition.
and
so
asking
this
court
to
simply
affirm
the...
the
firearm
enhancement
that
was
originally
imposed
in
this
case
does
not
constitute
imposing
a
sentence
that
would
any
way
be
inconsistent
with
washington
law.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
in
the...
in
a
subsequent
or
nearly
subsequent
breath,
the
prosecutor
then
asked
for
the
enhancement,
the
36-month
enhancement,
that
applies
for
firearms.
i
think
what
you're
seeing
there
is
that
the
prosecutor
was
responding
to
the...
to
defense
counsel's
use
of
the
term
element.
and
in...
in
the
year
2000,
before
apprendi,
before
blakely,
we
never
would
have
used
that
term
as
applied
to
a
sentencing
enhancement.
we
just
didn't
think
of
it
that
way.
now,
we
have
since
changed
our
thinking,
obviously,
after
apprendi.
but
i
think
if
you...
on
the...
on
the
overall
point,
if
you
look
at
defense
counsel's
comments
beginning
with
the
comments
pretrial,
where
he
notes
that
i
can
see
no
relevance
to...
to
the
admission
of
a
different
gun.
then
he
comments,
ms.
recuenco
was
threatened
with
a
380
automatic
with
a
clip.
regarding
the
charge
in
particular,
counsel
at
ja,
page
30
says,
the
allegation
and
the
basis
on
which
this
case
was
tried
was
under
a
theory
of
firearm.
at
ja
37,
counsel
said,
the
firearm
is
an
element
of
this
offense
as
it
has
been
pleaded
and
argued
to
the
jury
and
evidently,
perhaps,
obviously
proven
to
the
jury.
so--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--that's
right.
and...
and
i
think,
your
honor,
that
stems
from
the...
from
the
way
the
statutes
are
structured.
beginning
many,
many
years
ago,
in
washington
we
had
what
we
called
a
deadly
weapon
enhancement.
so
there
was
no
distinction
made
between
any
kind
of
weapon.
in
1995,
the
law
changed.
there
was
a
distinction
made
as
to
firearms.
the...
the
penalty
was
increased
as
to
firearms.
and
so
beginning
that
time,
there
was
a
material
distinction
depending
on
the
weapon
that
was
used.
but
i
think
that--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--deadly
weapon
was
still
called
an
enhancement,
your
honor,
under
the
statute.
and
so
the
statute
defined
deadly
weapon
very
generally,
and
then
in
the
punishment
section,
the
punishment
provisions,
which
specifically
were
formerly
under
section
310
of
the
sentencing
reform
act...
now
it's
been
renumbered
to
be
533.
under
that
provision...
you
have
two
provisions,
one
which
provides
the
punishment
for
deadly...
for
firearms,
and
under
this...
for
this
case,
that
would
be
3
years.
and
then
as
to
the
rest,
it
says
if
someone
was
armed
with
a
deadly
weapon
other
than
a
firearm,
you
have
a
lesser
penalty.
so
as
i
say,
i
think
that
for
a
long
time
we
have
treated...
in
washington,
we've
treated
all
of
these
things
as
deadly
weapons,
but
recognized
that
if
it
was
a
firearm,
the
penalty
was
greater
than
if
it
were
something
other
than
a
firearm.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
a
firearm
includes
pistols
and
revolvers
because
a
firearm
is
something...
anything
from
which
a
projectile
is
fired.
so--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--that's
the
way
it
was
defined
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
it
was...
it
was...
the...
the
jury
instructions
went
to
the
jury
to
find
deadly
weapon
as
a
firearm.
and
over
and
over,
the
court
reiterated,
especially
in
the
instructions
conference,
that
the...
there's
no
question
but
that
the
only
weapon
here
is
a
firearm,
and
so
they
used
the
simplified
version
of
the
instructions.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
no.
our...
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
it
cannot,
that
if...
you
either
have
a
firearm
or
you
have
no
enhancement
whatsoever.
if...
the
only
way
that
a...
that
a
gun
could
be
a...
it's...
it's
because
of
the
language,
other
than
a
firearm.
so,
in
other
words,
you
have
either
a
firearm
and
a
3-year
enhancement,
or
you
have,
as
i
say,
no...
no
weapon
enhancement
at
all.
so,
in
other
words--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--we
believe
that's
exactly
what
the
court
did
in
this
case,
your
honor,
by...
by
instructing
the
jury
that
deadly
weapon
is
firearm.
in
washington,
we
never
tell
the
jury--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--well,
there...
there
are
two
parts
to
the
answer.
let
me
answer
that
one
first.
there...
our
position
is
there
is
no
lesser
included
offense
of
a
firearm
that's
still
a
deadly
weapon.
and
if
you
look
at
state
v.
olney,
o
l
n
e
y,
that
was
one
of
the
cases
reversed
in
the
recuenco
case,
you'll
see
that...
that
they
explain
why
that's
the
case.
in
other
words,
it's
either
a
firearm
or
there's
no
enhancement
whatsoever.
the...
the
other
part
of
the
question
i
wanted
to
just
clarify
is
that
in
washington,
we
would
not
be
telling
the
jury
the
length
of
time
that...
that
the
defendant
would
face--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--i'm
saying
that
the
instructions
that
went
to
the
jury,
correct,
were...
were
proper.
what
was
improper
in
this
case
is
that
the
special
verdict
form
did
not
sufficiently
or
specifically
enough
preserve
the
jury's
verdict
so
that,
in
other
words,
when
the
jury
passed
on
this
case
and
returned
a
verdict
form
that
said
deadly
weapon,
that
did
not
expressly
encompass
the
firearm.
and
so...
and
that
was...
that
was
the...
the
mistake
that
was
made
in
this
case.
we
should
have
submitted
a
verdict
form
to
the
jury
that
would...
that
would
let
a
jury
expressly
describe
what
the
verdict
was.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
that
portion
of
the
washington
law,
your
honor,
isn't...
isn't
crystal
clear,
but
what
i
can
say
is
that
that's
not
in
this
case
because
trial
counsel
at...
at
trial
on
more
than
one
occasion
specifically
said
it
was
irrelevant
to
this
case.
what
we
have
to
prove
is
that
the
firearm
was
a
real
gun,
and--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--in
that
circumstance,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
but...
but
obviously,
as
counsel...
on
page
ja
31
and
at
ja
38,
counsel
very
specifically
said
the
state
tries
to
say
that
a
nonworking
firearm
can
also
be
the
basis
for
this
offense,
and
certainly
it
can
be.
and
then
at...
at
page
38,
they
say,
obviously,
the
question
of
whether
it
actually
worked
or
not
would
be
irrelevant
under
the
law.
so
the...
strictly
speaking,
the
question
of
operability
wasn't
before
the
jury.
we
did
have
to
prove
that
it
was
real.
and,
of
course,
there
was
never
any
dispute
about
that.
the
defendant's...
by
the
defendant's
own
testimony,
for
example,
in
the...
in
the
transcript
at
page
677...
that
would
be
volume
8,
on
1/24/2000,
page
677...
the
defendant
spoke
at
some
length
about
the
fact
that
he
was
worried
about
his
children
getting
a
hold
of
this
gun.
there
were
significant
safety
concerns.
at
page
680,
he
talked
about
how
he
locks
it
up
all
the
time.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
operability,
your
honor,
is...
is...
there
were
a
series
of
cases
that...
that
arose
in
washington
having
to
do
with...
with
a
gun
that
was
basically
a
real
gun,
but
that
there
was
technically
wrong
with
it.
and
those
series
of
cases
discussed
how
soon
it
could
be
rendered
operable
to
make
it
still
constitute
a
real
gun.
but
i
think
that's
really
kind
of
an
esoteric
area
of
the
law.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
well,
that's
what
the...
what
the
cases
have
said
is
that
it
only
has
to
be
ready...
could
be
made
ready
to...
to
fire
in
a
short
amount
of
time,
yes.
as
i
say,
that's
simply
not
in
this
case
because
counsel
conceded
this
gun...
that
operability
wasn't
an
issue
here.
all
we
had
to
prove
was
that
it
was
a
real
gun.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
the
charging
document
said
the
defendant
was
armed
with
a
deadly
weapon,
which
establishes
the
general
category,
and
then,
to
wit,
a
handgun.
as
i
say,
there...
there
was
no
issue
either...
either
pretrial
or
throughout
the
course
of
the
trial
that
counsel
knew
precisely
what
he
was
facing.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
that's
right.
they
only
used
the
terms,
deadly
weapon,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
in
the
washington
state
supreme
court,
we
conceded
that,
technically
speaking,
the
jury's
verdict
didn't
encompass
the
firearm
finding.
the
express
verdict
didn't
encompass
the
firearm
finding.
but
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case,
it's
our...
our
view
that
that
error,
even
though
it
could
be
an
error,
is
harmless.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
i
think,
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
if
you
imagine
a
situation,
as
justice
kennedy
was
posing,
where
the
jury
was
presented
with
two
options
and
they
were
going
to
choose
one
or
the
other,
you
might
be
able
to
make
that
argument.
but
here,
the
jury
was
presented
only
with
the
definition
saying
deadly
weapon
is
a
firearm,
whether
loaded
or
not.
and
under
those
circumstances
and
under
the
circumstances
where
the
only
weapon
associated
with
this
assault
is
a
firearm,
the
only
thing
that
they
could
have
premised
their
decision
on
was
the
firearm.
so,
as
i
say,
it's
not
as
though
they
were
choosing
either
or.
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
you
might
have
had
that
situation.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
they
are
ordinarily
read
a
copy
of
the
information,
your
honor,
at
the
start
of
the
case.
i
don't
recall
that
being
transcribed
in
the...
in
the
transcript
as...
as
the
court
has
it.
that
is
the
ordinary
course
of
proceedings.
in...
in
the
respondent's
brief,
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
time
spent
on
distinguishing
this
case
or...
or
trying
to
analogize
this
case
actually
to
charging
defects.
as
i've
indicated
already
for
the
past
few
minutes,
i
believe
that
this
case
simply
doesn't
present
that
issue
because
it
was
readily
apparent
that
this
defendant
was
fully
advised
of
what
he
was
facing.
now,
if
there
were
other
defects...
if
there
were
true
defects
in
the
charging
document
or
if
the
defendant
was
surprised
by
the
sentence
that
the
judge
ultimately
imposed,
then
we
would
have
to
analyze,
separately
analyze,
whether
or
not
the
charging
was
sufficient.
and
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
under
washington
law,
that
is
a
separate
analysis,
a
separate
analysis--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--correct.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
and...
and
i
think
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor,
again
we
have
to
step
back
to
the
year
2000
and...
pre
apprendi,
et
cetera.
at
that
time,
there
were
a
series
of
cases,
meggyesy,
olney
and
rai,
r
a
i,
that...
that
are
overturned,
quite
frankly,
by
the
recuenco
opinion,
where
the
appellate
courts
had
quite
expressly
said
that
it
was
sufficient
to
submit
the
deadly
weapon
verdict
form
in
that
form
to
a
jury
where
it's
clear
that
the
only
weapon
at
issue
was
a
firearm.
in
each
one
of
those
cases,
that
was
what
was
done.
and
in
fact,
in
at
least
one
of
them,
the
victim
was
shot,
so
there
couldn't
be
any
question.
so
there
was...
there
was
a
well
established
practice
in
washington
law
at
the
time
of
proving
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
it's
true
that
the
more
thorough
practice,
the
more
precise
practice
would
have
been
to
submit
a
verdict
form
that
said
firearm,
but
that
wasn't
done
in
this
case,
but
it
wasn't
done,
i
believe,
pursuant
to
those
cases.
unless
the
court
has
any
additional
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
i
think
the
key
difference
is
the
charging
part
of
your
hypothetical.
your
hypothetical
assumes
this
defendant
was
never
put
on
notice
that
he
was
facing
aggravated
murder,
and
if
that
were
true,
then
under
your
cases
and
under...
under
our
washington
law,
we
would
analyze
that
as
a
failure
of
notice.
the...
and
it
could
have
any
number
of
implications
for
a
defendant,
including
the
evidence
that
they
marshal
at
trial,
but
also
including
perhaps
his
interest
in
negotiating
a
plea
agreement
if
a
defendant
doesn't
know
that
he's
facing
aggravated
murder
at
the
end.
so--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--then
i
think
that
is
susceptible
to
harmless
error
analysis,
your
honor.
and
it
would
be...
there
would
be
an
open
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
of
course,
it
is
harmless,
but
then
i
think
that
we're
back
to
the
neder
situation.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
you
would
be
closer
to
justice
scalia's
case,
justice
stevens,
yes.
although
under
washington
law,
we
analyze
the
charging
document
and
the
sufficiency
of
it
and
ask
whether
or
not
it
was...
the
words
used
sufficiently
apprised
the
defendant.
but
i
think
the
defendant
would
have
a
stronger
argument
for
the
fact
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
facing
if
you
had
that
hypothetical.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
they
can
be
a
component
of
the
harmless
error
analysis.
ordinarily
in
washington,
we
would
handle
that
as
a
charging
document
challenge.
in
other
words,
the
defendant
would
say
i
was
never
charged
with
this
crime
and
therefore
i
didn't
marshal
my
evidence,
et
cetera.
it's
a
due
process
violation.
either
way,
i
don't
think
that
the...
the
conviction
stands
much
chance
of
surviving.
i
did
want
to
answer,
first,
a
question
that
had
been
raised
by
pointing
the
court
to
ja
18
where
the
defendant
says,
my
proposed
instruction
makes
clear
that
the
deadly
weapon
in
question
is
the
firearm,
that...
not
that
some
other
kind
of
weapon
might
have
been
deadly.
so
i
think
that
focuses
the
issue
appropriately.
i
also
wanted
to
point
out
that
justice
alito's
hypothetical
is
really
the
state
v.
williams
case
that
we
cited
at
page
14
in
our
reply
brief
where
the
defendant
was
expressly
charged
firearm
and
the
victim
was
shot
during
the
course
of
the
crime.
and
the
issue
didn't
go...
the...
the
same
verdict
form
as
we
have
here...
in
other
words,
it
said
only
deadly
weapon...
was
given
to
the
jury,
and
the
washington
court
of
appeals,
feeling
itself
bound
by
recuenco,
reversed
that
finding.
so
i
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
washington
supreme
court
is
unduly
broad
and
should
be
overturned.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
thank
you,
your
honor.
