suppose...
suppose
the
company
gets
a
competitive
advantage
by
engaging
in
the
sort
of
activity
that's
would
be
traditionally
be
associated
with
organized
crime,
let's
say,
extortion
or
labor
offenses.
would
your
causation
argument
be
any
different
in
that
situation
if
a
competitor
filed
a
civil
rico
action?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

is
there...
is
there
any
limit
on
the
number
of
competitors
who
would
have
standing?
you
mentioned
cigarette
taxes.
suppose
one
newsstand
in
new
york
city
is
not
collecting
the
cigarette
tax.
does
that
mean
that
everybody
else
who's
selling
cigarettes
in
new
york
would
be
able
to
bring
a
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
where
would
the
line
be
drawn?
