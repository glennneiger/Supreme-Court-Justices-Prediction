well,
why...
why
is
that
true?
let's
assume
that
they
could
establish
that
there
was
a
purpose
and
an
intent
to
adopt
this...
this
tax
evasion
scheme
and
that
the
whole
object
was
to
undermine
and...
and
injure
the
competitor,
and
they
show
that
this
scheme
began
to
work
and
that
their
reputation
as
a
lower
cost
competitor
was...
was
well
established.
why...
why
isn't
that
enough?

anza
versus

steel
supply
corporation.
justice
anthony

in
this
case,
two
steel
supply
companies,
ideal
steel
supply
and
national
steel
supply,
compete
with
each
other
in
the
new
york
city
area.
they
each
operate
one
store
in
queens
and
they
each
operate
one
store
in
the
bronx,
and
the
competing
stores
are
nearby
each
other.
ideal
sued
national
and
national’s
owners.
ideal
claimed
that
national
and
its
owners,
joseph
and
vincent
anza,
failed
to
charge
cash-paying
customers
for
new
york
sales
tax
and
that
they
then
failed
to
report
the
cash
sales
to
the
state
tax
authorities.
ideal
says
that
these
actions
gave
national
a
competitive
advantage
in
attracting
customers.
ideal
sued,
alleging
a
violation
of
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act,
commonly
known
as
rico.
it
claimed
that
the
anzas
violated
section
1962(c)
of
the
act
by
conducting
national’s
affairs
through
a
pattern
of
defrauding
the
state
of
new
york.
it
also
claimed
the
anzas
and
national
violated
1962(a)
of
the
act
by
investing
the
proceeds
of
their
scheme
in
the
establishment
of
national’s
bronx
store.
national
and
the
anzas
moved
to
dismiss
ideal’s
complaint,
and
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
granted
the
motion.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit
reversed,
concluding
that
ideal
could
maintain
these
claims.
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals’
judgments
with
respect
to
ideal’s
claim
based
on
section
1962(c).
in
holmes
versus
securities
investors
protection
corporation,
this
court
held
that
a
plaintiff
may
sue
for
a
rico
violation
only
if
the
violation
was
the
proximate
cause
of
the
plaintiff’s
injury.
now,
critical
to
the
proximate-cause
analysis
is
the
directness
of
the
relationship
between
the
asserted
violation
and
the
claimed
harm.
in
this
case,
ideal’s
theory
is
that
joseph
and
vinson
anza
harmed
it
by
defrauding
the
new
york
tax
authority
and
then
used
the
proceeds
of
their
fraudulent
activities
to
offer
lower
prices
and
thereby
attract
some
of
ideal’s
customers.
the
direct
victim
of
this
conduct,
though,
was
the
state
of
new
york,
not
ideal.
ideal
asserts
it
suffered
its
own
harms
when
the
anzas
failed
to
charge
customers
for
the
applicable
sales
tax.
but
the
cause
of
these
harms
is
a
set
of
actions,
offering
lower
prices
entirely
distinct
from
the
alleged
rico
violations,
which
involved
defrauding
the
state.
ideal’s
claim
thus
could
not
satisfy
the
requirement
of
proximate
causation.
this
result
is
confirmed
by
considering
how
the
directness
requirement
works.
one
aspect
of
it
is
designed
to
recognize
the
difficulty
that
can
arise
when
a
court
attempts
to
ascertain
damages
caused
by
some
remote
action.
here,
national
could
have
lowered
its
prices
for
any
number
of
reasons
unconnected
to
the
asserted
tax
frauds.
likewise,
the
fact
that
a
company
commits
tax
fraud
does
not
mean
that
company
will
lower
its
prices.
the
additional
cash
could
go
anywhere,
from
asset
acquisition
to
research
and
development
to
dividend
payouts.
there
is,
in
addition,
a
second
discontinuity
between
the
rico
violation
and
the
asserted
injury.
ideal’s
lost
sales
could
have
resulted
from
factors
other
than
the
petitioners’
alleged
tax
frauds.
businesses
lose
and
gain
customers
for
many
reasons;
it
would
require
a
complex
assessment
to
determine
what
portion
of
ideal’s
lost
sales
were
the
product
of
national’s
decreased
prices.
undertaking
such
inquiries
is
inconsistent
with
our
opinion
in
holmes.
the
requirement
of
a
direct
causal
connection
is
especially
warranted
where
the
immediate
victims
of
an
alleged
rico
violation
can
be
expected
to
vindicate
the
laws
by
pursuing
their
own
claims,
and
here
ideal
accuses
the
anzas
of
defrauding
the
state
of
new
york
out
of
a
substantial
sum
of
money.
if
those
allegations
are
true,
the
state
of
new
york
can
be
expected
to
pursue
appropriate
remedies.
in
sum,
we
hold
that
ideal’s
claim
based
on
section
1962(c)
does
not
meet
the
requirement
of
proximate
causation
discussed
in
holmes.
ideal
also
asserts
a
claim
based
on
a
violation
of
section
1962(a)
dealing
with
the
investment
of
racketeering
proceeds.
national
and
the
anzas
say
the
proximate-cause
analysis
should
function
identically
for
purposes
of
ideal’s
1962
claim
and
its
section
1962(a)
claim.
the
proximate-cause
inquiry,
however,
requires
careful
consideration
of
the
relationship
between
the
injury
asserted
and
the
injurious
conduct
alleged.
because
section
1962(c)
and
section
1962(a)
articulate
distinct
prohibitions,
it
is
at
least
debatable
whether
ideal’s
two
claims
should
be
analyzed
in
an
identical
fashion
for
proximate-cause
purposes.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
ideal
adequately
pleaded
its
section
1962(a)
claim,
but
the
court
did
not
addressed
proximate
causation.
we
decline
to
consider
the
claim
without
the
benefit
of
the
court
of
appeals’
analysis,
particularly
when
the
parties
devoted
nearly
all
of
their
attention
in
this
court
to
the
section
1962(c)
claim.
we
therefore
vacate
the
court
of
appeals’
judgment
with
respect
to
ideal’s
section
1962(a)
claim;
justice
scalia
has
issued
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
issued
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part;
justice
breyer
has
issued
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
