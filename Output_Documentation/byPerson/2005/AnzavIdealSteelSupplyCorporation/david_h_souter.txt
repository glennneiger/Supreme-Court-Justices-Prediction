justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
there
something
different
here?
because
in...
in
holmes,
the...
the
party
that
was
claiming
the...
sort
of
the
ultimate
damage
was
damaged
because
other
people
up
the
line
were
damaged,
the...
the
shareholders
and
then
the
broker
dealers
and
so
on.
there
was
a
kind
of
a
direct
line
of...
of
causation.
but
the
people
who
were
claiming
were
at
the
tail
end
of
it.
here,
the
causation
between
the...
or
the...
or
the
cause
of
the
harm
to...
to
the
clients
on...
on
the
other
side
was...
was
direct.
it
was
direct
competition
harm.
so
we
are
in
a
different
situation
from
holmes.
in
other
words,
they...
they
weren't...
the...
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
not
injured
simply
because
new
york
lost
some
money.
they
were
injured
in...
in
their
own
right
by...
by
the
competition
between
them
and
your
client.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
they
suffered
the
harm
because
the
firm
suffered
the
harm.
there
was...
there
was...
there's
a
word
there.
there
was...
there
was
a
victim
in...
in
the
direct
line
of
causation,
if
you
will,
between
them
and...
and
the...
and
the
offending
rico
party.
here,
there's...
there's
nobody
in
between
the
two
of
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may...
may
i
ask
you
to
focus
this
way,
just
going
one
step
further
than
the
hypo
you've
got?
let's
assume
that
the...
that
the
defendant
engages
in
extortion
against
a
and
makes
a
lot
of
money
doing
it.
as
a
result
of
that,
in...
in
dealing
with
b,
the
defendant,
in
fact,
can...
can
offer...
offer
goods
for
sale
to
b's
customers
at
a
lower
price
simply
because
he's
getting
all
this
income
from
the
extortion.
in
that
case,
wouldn't
your
analysis
be
the
same
as
your
analysis
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
if
that's
the
case,
then...
if...
if
the
relationship
between
the
parties
is
the
same,
then
the
presence
of
violence
or
nonviolence
has
nothing
to
do
with
your...
your
position.
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't...
isn't
the
problem
with
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
and...
and
a
problem
which...
which
is
bothering
you
with
your
case
this?
we're
talking
here
about
two
different
lines
of
causation?
and
each
of
them,
to
some
degree,
contributes
to
the
ultimate
result
which
you
claim,
which
is
a
loss
of
business
and...
and
business
harm.
one
line
of
causation
is...
is
competitive.
it's
price
competition.
they
charge
less.
they
lure
the
customers
away.
the
other
line
of
competition
is
fraud
on
the
state
of
new
york
which
makes
it
easier
for
them
to
engage
in
price
competition.
so
far
as
the
fraud
on
the
state
of
new
york
is
concerned,
its
effect
on
your
client's
business
is
indirect.
in
other
words,
they
can
defraud
new
york
without
hurting
your
client.
they
might
simply
have
pocketed
all
they
money
they
saved,
but
the...
the
only
way
that
the
fraud
on
new
york
hurts
your
client
is
that
it
puts
them
in
a
better
position
to
engage
in
the
second
line
of
causation
that
hurts
your
client
and
that
is
direct
price
competition.
if
you
accept
the
fact
that
there
are
two
different
lines
of
causation
here,
don't
we
have
to
say,
under
the
holmes
direct
analysis,
that
so
far
as
the
fraud
on
new
york,
which
is
the
rico
violation,
the
consequence
is
an
indirect
one,
the
consequence
to
your
client,
but
so
far
as
the
price
competition
is
concerned,
the
consequence
is
a
direct
one,
but
price
competition
isn't
a
rico
violation,
which
leaves
us
saying,
so
far
as
the
rico
violation
is
concerned,
it's
indirect?
now,
if...
if
i
have
gone
astray,
tell
me
where.
