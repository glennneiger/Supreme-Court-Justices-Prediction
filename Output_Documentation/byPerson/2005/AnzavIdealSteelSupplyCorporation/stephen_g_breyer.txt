justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
rather
surprised
at
your
answers
because
i
was
thinking
you
want
to
draw
a
rather
clear
line
between
where
fraud
is
at
issue,
and
only
fraud.
proximate
cause,
case
a,
the
fraud
does
nothing
but
lowers
the
costs
of
the
firm;
case
b,
the
fraud
is
something
that
directly
is
aimed
to
raise
the
cost
of
a
particular
specified
competitor.
i
see
a
clear
difference
between
those
two
cases,
but
you
apparently
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it's
not
nebulous.
it's
absolutely
clear.
in
the
one
hand,
you
are
targeting
a
particular
defendant
to
raise...
a
particular
competitor
to
raise
his
costs.
in
the
other
hand,
you
are
taking
an
action
that
simply
lowers
your
own
and,
therefore,
equally
will
hurt
any
competitor,
whether
there's
one
or
a
million.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
if
you
had
my
test,
you'd
win
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
don't
want
to
give
you
a
win--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on...
on
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
if
that's
so,
then
go
back
for
a
minute,
please,
to
justice
souter's
question.
it
doesn't
concern
violence.
i'm...
certainly
if
violence
is
involved
or
a
direct
action
against
an
employee
or
the
competitor
himself,
then
i'll
assume
you'd
win.
but
the
line
i
think
that
he
drew
very
clearly
and
i
think
justice
stevens
picked
up
on,
as
i
heard
it,
is
a...
a
fraud
where
the
person
defrauded
is
not
the
competitor
and
the
only
effect
of
the
fraud
is
to
lower
the
cost
of
the
person
who
is
doing
the
fraud.
now,
if
that's
so,
you
either
draw
justice
souter's
line
or
you
don't.
if
you
do
draw
justice
souter's
line,
then
you
stay
out
of
the
thicket.
if
you
don't,
you'll
have
all
the
problems
that
were
mentioned,
that
there
is
no
way
to
distinguish
between
one
person,
two
persons,
100
people.
there
is
no
way
to
know
whether
the
lower
cost
of
the
defrauding
person
did
or
did
not
lead
to
the
shift
of
sales.
there
is
no
way
to
know,
indeed,
whether
it's
a
rent,
in
which
case
prices
didn't
fall,
or
whether
it's
actually
some
kind
of
ability
of
the
competitor...
of
the
defrauding
person
to
take
over
the
market.
all
those
things
that
are
issue
in
antitrust
cases
and
totally
unsolvable
are
suddenly
imported
into
rico,
where
if
you
really
want
to
bring
a
case,
bring
an
antitrust
case,
and
at
least
people
know
how
to
face
it
there.
that's...
that's
the...
that's
the
kind
of
claim...
that's
the
kind
of
problem
that
i
think
you're
facing,
and
i'd
like
you
to
have
the
chance
to
respond
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
does
that
mean?
then
that
means
you
have
like
the
family
vendetta
exception
to
the
rico--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
i
mean,
you
see
the
point.
the
point
is
i
don't
see
how
it's
administrable
in
a
law,
particularly
in
an
economic
context--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
people
who
are
interested
in
making
money
are
prepared
to
say,
look,
we
want
to
make
the
money.
we'd
like
to
get
rid
all
our
competitors,
and
then
we
start
distinguishing
between
they'd
like
to
get
rid
of
all
of
them.
no,
only
five.
no,
one.
and
does
that
make
a
difference
in
whether
you
can
bring
a
case
or
not?
i
frankly
don't
see--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
it
would
come
from
would
be
it
would
be
an
alternative
way
of
getting
to,
say,
justice
souter's
test,
and
it
couldn't...
i
agree
with
you...
depend
upon
whether
these
are
within
the
realm
of
people
who
are
relying.
but
suppose
you
had
a
fraud
where
nobody
had
relied.
you
see,
it
was
really
a
failed
fraud,
and
you
can
get
that
under
federal
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
suppose
you
have
a
fraud
where
the
only
party
that
had
relied
was
the
government,
in
which
case
you
don't
need
them
for
civil
rico.
and
the
strong
argument,
i
think,
would
be
where
that's
the
case,
cut
it
off
because
of
all
the
indirect
problems
that
holmes
goes
into.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
accepting
it.
i'm
just
trying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
put
it
in
what
i
think
of
as
a
strong
form.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
place
where
it
comes
from
is
the
idea
that
if,
in
fact,
you
have
these
monetary
crimes,
white
collar
kinds
of
crimes,
money
is
at
issue,
and
no
one
is
hurt.
you
can
proceed
against
a
person
under
federal
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
no
one
is
hurt.
you
catch
it
in
the
bud,
for
example,
where
no
one
is
hurt.
you
don't
want
the
possible
class
of
plaintiffs
to
spread
out
into
every
competitor,
into
competitors'
suppliers.
it's
a
way
of
cutting
off
the
potential
class
to
people
who
are
closer
to
any
possible
injury
where,
for
example,
there
really
wasn't
any
injury
at
all.
so,
i
mean,
that's
the
kind
of
argument
being
made
for
it,
not
that
you
find
the
word
reliance
somewhere
in
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
just
tried
to
say
where...
where
it
was.
it's
a...
it's
a
way
of...
with
proximate
cause,
and
that's
how
i
think
you
have
to
deal
with
it.
you
have
a
case
where
there
was
reliance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
you'd
have
to
say
is
why
that's
good
enough.
