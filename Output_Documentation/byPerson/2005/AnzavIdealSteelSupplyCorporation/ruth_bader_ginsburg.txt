mr.
frederick,
you...
you
started
by
saying
how
difficult
this
would
be
to
prove,
but
could
the
plaintiff
piggyback
on
new
york?
if
new
york
was
the
defrauded
party
and
taxes
are
owed
to
the
state,
has
the
state
had
no
proceeding
in
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
complaint
has
since
been
amended
to
assert
a
federal
income
tax
shortfall?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
impediment
to
new
york
suing?
this
would
be
kind
of
strange.
new
york
has
its
tax
scheme.
it
has
penalties
for
failure
to
pay
tax.
and
then
it
could
go
into
the
federal
court
and
say
rico
is
better
than
our
penalties.
rico
has
treble
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
second
circuit
seemed
to
rely
on
an
earlier
case
that
is
much
featured
in
respondent's
brief,
but
i
don't
recall
your
dealing
with
it.
is
that
commercial
cleaning
case
of
the
knowingly
hiring
undocumented
aliens
and
paying
them
less
than
the
minimum
wage,
which
gave
that
person
a
competitive
edge
over
rivals
who...
who
paid
what
the
law
required?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
for
relaying...
relating
the
position
of
the
united
states...
are
you
relying
on
that
brief
in
the
bank
of
china
case
that
was
filed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--which...
which
was
kind
of
said
in
passing
to
say
that
there
was
no...
that
the...
that
the
court
below
was
right
and
we
shouldn't
take
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
being...
is
there
any
other
case
where
the
defendant
is
charged
with
not
paying
tax
either
to
the
federal
government
or
the
state?
now
you
have
it
both
because
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
said
they
haven't
paid
tax
for
this...
their
income...
federal
income
tax
either.
this
seems
to
be
a
novel
claim,
and
i
don't
know
of
another
where
failure
to
pay
tax
owed
to
a
state
or
the
federal
government
is
the
basis
for
a
rico
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
getting
away
from--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
we
go
back
to
the
question
that
i
was
trying
to
ask
you
before
with
relation
to
the
novelty
of
this
because
it
involves
fraud
on
the...
a
government
that's
a
tax
assessor
and
collector?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
taxing
authorities,
both
state
and
federal,
might
have
some
genuine
concern
with
a
potential
plaintiff's
examining
to
see,
gee,
has
my...
has
my
rival,
my
competitor
cheated
on
his
or
her
tax.
that...
that
could
be
pretty
disruptive
of
the
state
or
the
federal
government
administering
their
tax
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
wasn't
concerned
about
that
problem.
i
was
concerned
about
people
setting
themselves
up
as
private
enforcers
of
tax
liability
as
kind
of
a
surrogate
for
the
government
out
there
detecting
who's
violated
the
tax
laws.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
your
client's
supplier?
if
your
client...
if
ideal
is
selling
less,
then
it's
going
to
buy
less
from
its
supplier.
so
would
the
supplier
also
have
a
rico
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
is
new
york
relying?
i
mean,
they...
somebody...
does...
does
the
state
or
the
federal
taxpayer
rely
on
everybody
who
files
a
return
that
they...
they
filed
it
honestly?
is
that...
that...
i
don't
understand
the
sense
in
which
a
taxing
authority
relies
on
the
return
that's
been
filed.
