mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ideal
steel
asks
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
send
this
case
back
to
trial
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
case
is
ready
to
be
tried.
we
ask
you
to
do
this
for
four
reasons.
first,
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions
in
sedima
in
1985
and
national
organization
for
women
in
1994.
second,
the
second
circuit's
decision
is
entirely
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
holmes
in
1992.
third,
we
submit
that
reliance
is
not
an
element
of
a
civil
rico
claim
based
on
predicate
acts
of
mail
and
wire
fraud.
but
fourth,
if
reliance
is
an
element,
then
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
reliance
by
a
third
party
not
only
suffices
under
rico,
but
sufficed
at
common
law.
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
decision
should
be
affirmed.
the
case
should
go
back
for
trial.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
i
am.
justice
ginsburg,
i
am.
5
months
ago,
as
you
know,
when--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--your
honor,
the...
justice
ginsburg,
the
solicitor
general
filed
its
amicus
brief
here
5
months
ago
when
this
court
had
accepted
the
case
for
review.
in
its
brief,
the
solicitor
general
said
no
fewer
than
seven
times,
not
just
as
a
passing
aside,
that
third
party
reliance,
what
the
solicitor
general
called
reliance
by
someone,
not
only
suffices
under
rico,
but
sufficed
at
common
law.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
position.
here,
we
have
that
reliance
by
a
third
party,
what
the
government
called
someone,
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
yes.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
justice
ginsburg,
as
you
correctly
pointed
out,
ideal's
second
amended
complaint,
which
is
not
before
this
court
in
this
proceeding,
alleged
an
income
tax
scheme.
and...
and
judge
berman
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
permitted
that
amendment.
i
am
not
aware
of
another
case
involving
a
competitor
bringing
a
claim
on
these
set
of
facts.
however,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
on
the
merits,
there
is
a
discrete
set
of
rico
cases
involving
competitors
as
plaintiffs
who
either
allege
misrepresentations
to
third
parties,
whether
customers
or
government
agencies,
bribes,
or
violence
and
threats
of
violence.
i
submit
to
you
that
this
court's
decision
in
national
organization
for
women
in
1994
presents
a
variation
on
the
theme.
you
will
recall
that
in
that
case
the
anti
abortion
protestors,
the
defendants,
engaged
in
violence
or
threats
of
violence
directed
at
customers,
and
the
injury
was
to
the
health
care
clinics,
the
plaintiffs.
and...
and
i
wish
to
say
that...
that
petitioners--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--yes.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
it
was.
petitioners--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--yes.
they
try
to
distinguish
national
organization
for...
for
women
in
two
ways,
justice
scalia.
first,
they
say
that
in
national
organization
for
women,
the
potential
patients,
the
customers,
were
a
constituent
part
of
the...
of
the
health
clinic's
business.
that's
true
here
also.
but
more
important,
they
say
in
their
reply
brief
that
this
court
only
decided
that
case
on
article
iii
standing.
that
is
not
correct.
if
you
look
at
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits
filed
in
that
case
in
september
1993,
both
issues
were
raised,
article
iii
standing
and
rico
standing,
meaning
injury
plus
proximate
cause.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
certainly...
certainly,
justice
scalia,
there
was.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
in
a--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--these
are
inappropriate
financial
inducements.
they
are
offered
a
lesser
price.
it's
a...
it's
a...
it's
an
underbidding--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--justice
souter,
respectfully
i...
i
disagree
that
the
two
parts
of
the...
that
the
two
parts
of
the
sphere
of
the
scheme
can
be
broken
apart
like
that.
it's
one
scheme.
they
have...
the...
the
petitioners
have
to
defraud
the
state
of
new
york.
they
have
to
not
only
mislead
the
state
of
new
york,
but
fend
off
the
state
of
new
york,
which
frees
up
the
cash
which,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
enables
them
to
do
two
things.
first,
it
enables
them
to
offer
lower
prices,
which
does
competitively
injure
my
client.
second,
as
we
allege
in
the
complaint,
in
the
amended
complaint,
they
took
all
those
cash
proceeds
and
they
took
them
to
the
bronx
and
they
opened
up
a
competing
location
where
they
did
not
previously
have
one.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
see
that.
that's
certainly
not
true
in
this
case.
what
i
believe
is
true
in
this
case
is
that
but
for
my
client's
proactive
litigation,
this
never
would
have
come
to
the
taxing
authorities'
attention.
the
taxing
authorities
are
free
to
bring
their
own
case.
in
our
brief
on
the
merits,
in
fact,
we...
we
cited
one
case
where
the
city
of
new
york
suing
a
different
set
of
defendants
over
unpaid
cigarette
taxes.
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
let
us
assume
that
the
state
of
new
york
intervened
in
this
case,
which
is
always
a
possibility...
perhaps
it's
a
bit
late
now...
or
brought
its
own
case.
my
clients
and
the
state
of
new
york
are
chasing
two
different
piles
of
money,
two
separate
measures
of
damages.
in
our
brief
on
the
merits,
we
set
forth
a
hypothetical,
a
$100
cash
transaction,
to
illustrate
that.
my
clients
cannot
recover
the
lost
taxes
that
were
taken
from
the
state
of
new
york.
the
state
of
new
york
cannot
recover
the
lost
profits
that
my
client
suffered.
so
in...
in
the
holmes
sense,
we're
not
dealing
here
with
an
apportionment
problem
because--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--not
as
a
surrogate,
justice
ginsburg.
the...
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
wrongdoers
act
in
a
variety
of
ways.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
yes.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
right.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
if
b
could
pass
through
the
holmes
wicket
of
causation,
justice
stevens--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--the...
the
answer...
the
answer
would
be
yes.
where
i
believe--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--twenty
competitors
becomes
a
bit
more
difficult
to
get--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--to
get
them
all
through
the
holmes--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--analytically
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
if
there
were
20,
i
agree
that
all
should
be...
if
all
suffered
the
exact
same
competitive
injury
and
the
set
of
factors--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--assuming
that
defrauding
the
landlord,
justice
stevens,
involves
predicate
acts
of
mail
and
wire
fraud
or
some
other
variety--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--of...
of
predicate
act--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--yes.
then
the...
the
answer
would
be
yes.
and
if
you
look
at...
if
you
look
at
the
competitor
cases,
what
i
call
the
competitor
cases,
there's
a
very
discrete
body
of
law
we're
talking
about.
they're
cited
in
our
brief.
there's
fewer
than
a
dozen
cases
around
the
country
from
the
circuit
and
district
courts.
and
what
they
show
is
that
there's
only
three
ways
you...
there's
only
several
ways
you
can
do
this.
you
can...
you
can
make
a
misrepresentation
to
a
regulator
or
to
a
customer.
we
have
those
cases.
you
can
bribe
a
customer
or
a
regulator,
or
you
can
engage
in
violence
directed
at
a...
at
a
regulator
or
at
a
customer.
there's
only
three
variations.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
justice
alito,
we...
we
don't
have
those...
those
facts
here.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
i
don't
think
it...
every...
every
competitor
in
the
state
of
new
york
can
sue
because,
as
a
practical
matter,
i...
i
submit
to
you
that
someone
who
lives
in
manhattan
is
probably
not
going
to
go
to
queens
to
buy
their
cigarettes.
there
are
much--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--yes.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
in
that
factual
scenario,
yes.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
yes.
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
the
purpose
of
the
scheme,
the
purpose
of
defrauding
the
state
of
new
york
was
not
just
to
fend
off
the
state
of
new
york,
but
to
free
up
the
cash
to
be
able
to
offer
a
price
discount.
as...
as
the
second
circuit
found,
relying
on
the
commercial
cleaning
case,
which
we
think
is
very
much
on
point,
that
is
the
reason
why
they
did
it.
you
can't
separate
them
apart
like
that.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
they
say
that's
part
of
the
background,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
it's
not
our
position.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
that
is...
that
is
part
of--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--no.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
no.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
justice
scalia--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--the
complaint--
[laughter]
justice
scalia,
the
amended
complaint
alleges
that
my
client,
ideal
steel,
was
the
target,
was
the
intended
victim
of
this
scheme.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
your
honor,
justice
breyer,
they
raised
the
family
feud.
we
explained
it
in
a
footnote.
that's
not
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
justice--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--justice
scalia--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--what
is
alleged
in
the
amended
complaint
is
that
in
the
burroughs
of
queens
and
the
bronx,
these
are
the
only
two
competitors.
only
two.
they
are
head
to
head
competitors.
we
allege
in
the--
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
--theoretically,
yes.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
theoretically.
[laughter]
well,
justice
posner,
in
a
case
we
cited
in
the
footnote,
talks
about
the
concept
of
the
intended
victim
where
you
blow
up...
where
the
defendant
blows
up
the
airplane
to
kill
a
and
he
also
kills
b
who's
sitting
next
to
him
on
the
plane.
that's
the
edc
case.
we
allege
that
the
plane,
so
to
speak,
was
blown
up
here
specifically
to
get
my
client.
that's
the
reason
why
they
used
the
proceeds
to
open
the
competing
location
in
the
bronx.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
when
we
begin
talking
about
suppliers
and
creditors
and
bankers
and
employees,
creditors,
so
to
speak,
they're
one
step
removed.
they
are,
respectfully,
i
believe
in
the
position
of
sipc
in
the
holmes
case.
we...
we
don't
have
to
go
to
that
level
in
this
case.
creditors,
suppliers...
let's
suppose
that
ideal
becomes
insolvent
as
a
result
of
this
scheme.
the
creditors
may
step
forward
and
believe
that
they
have
a
rico
claim
against
the
anzas
and
national.
i
believe
that
they
have
to
pass
through
the
holmes
causation
test,
and
it
would
be
difficult
based
on
the
sipc
analysis.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
yes.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
the
lower
federal
courts
after
holmes
have
used
the
target
concept
and
the
intent
concept
to...
to
inform,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
the
holmes
analysis.
they...
and
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
used
that
as
a
shorthand
to
inform
one
of
the
three
policy
factors
that
this
court
set
forth
in
holmes,
which
i
believe
was
the
third
factor,
which
is
the
proper
plaintiff.
and
the
lower
federal
courts,
in
these
discrete
body
of
cases
involving
competitors,
like
the
second
circuit
in
commercial
cleaning,
have
looked
to
see
whether
the
plaintiff
is
an
intended
victim
of
the
scheme,
a
target,
for
lack
of
a
better
word.
this
is...
let
me...
let
me
speak
about
the
question
of
reliance,
if
i
may.
we
don't
see
how
reliance
is
an
element
of
a
civil
rico
claim.
it
has
no
basis
in
law.
we
can't
just
pull
it
out
of
the
air.
it's
not
in
1964(c).
it's
not
in
1962,
which
is
the
substantive
violation.
it's
not
in
1961,
which
defines
racketeering
activity
and
pattern.
it's
not
in
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
statutes.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
yes.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
that...
yes,
the
solicitor
general
said
that.
we
happen
to
disagree
with
that
part
of
it
because
they
don't
tell
us
where
the
reliance
requirement
comes
from
either.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
correct.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
right.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
i
understand.
here,
we...
we
clearly
allege
and
the
second
circuit
found
sufficient
that
there
was
third
party
reliance,
mainly
reliance
by
the
new
york
department
of
taxation.
that
sufficed
at
common
law.
we
have
new
york
cases
going
back
to
the
time
of
the
civil
war,
the
treatise
writers,
the
restatement,
the
case
from
maine
involving...
that
justice
scalia
mentioned
involving
the
ship
captain.
this
has
been
well
settled
for...
for
many
years.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
the
law
is
it's
either
actual
reliance
or
presumptive
reliance.
the
taxing
authorities
actually
rely
or
they
are
presumed
to
rely
on
the
validity
of
the...
of
the
tax
returns.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that's
what's
alleged
in
our
amended
complaint
and
that
is
what
the
facts
are
in
this
case.
it
is...
and...
and
if
you
look
at
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
bank
of
china,
the
government
cited
this
case
with
approval
as
an
example
of
an
appropriate
use
of
third
party
reliance.
and...
and
i...
i
submit
to
you
that,
while
i
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
reliance
is
an
element
whenever
mail
or
wire...
i
mean,
for
example,
if
the
predicate
acts
here
involved
extortion,
a
hobbs
act
violation,
violence
in
some
form,
we
wouldn't
be
here
talking
about
reliance.
if
it
involved
the
payment
of
a
bribe,
we
wouldn't
be
here
talking
about
reliance.
what
is
it
about
mail
fraud
and
wire
fraud
that
springs
from
the
ground
this
concept
of
reliance?
my
point
is
i
don't
believe
it
has
any
basis
in
law,
and
i
think
this
court
should
say
so.
that's...
that's
why
we're
here
on
the
question
presented.
i
think
that
this
notion
should
be
swept
away
because
it
has
no
basis
in
law.
it's
not
in
the
statute.
and
this
court
has
found
on
several
occasions
that
where
someone
seeks
to
raise
a
requirement,
the
organized
crime
requirement,
the
prior
conviction
requirement,
this
court
has
said
it's
not
in
the
statute.
we
can't
engraft
it
onto
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
under
securities
fraud,
i
believe
that's
different
because
in
this
case
it's
not
a...
when
you're
dealing
with
competitors,
you're
not
dealing
with
face
to
face
misrepresentations.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
at
common
law,
there
was
a
reliance
requirement.
when
the
mail
fraud
statute
was
written
in
1872,
it's
an
amalgamation
of
various
common
law
crimes,
some
of
which
required
reliance,
some
of
which
clearly
did
not.
when
we
bring
the
mail
fraud
statute
into
rico,
it
does
not
bring
with
it
the
baggage
of
a
reliance
requirement.
and...
and
securities
fraud
is
gone
as
a
predicate
act
for
rico.
it's
been
gone
for
11
years.
where
does
the
reliance...
our
point
is
the
reliance
requirement
doesn't
come
from
anywhere.
it...
it's
simply
being
engrafted
onto
the
statute,
and
it
doesn't
belong
there.
that's...
that's
our
position.
it
must
have
some
basis
in
law.
it
doesn't.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
the
case...
the
cases
are
uniform,
including
decisions
from
this
court,
that
a
mail
fraud
case
does
not
require
the
element
of
reliance.
it
doesn't
exist
in
the
statute.
the...
it's
the
same
mail
fraud
statute
that's
a
predicate
act
for...
for
rico
under
section
1961.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
yes.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
but,
justice
breyer,
there
has
to
be
a
place
in
the
law
for
the
three
party
scheme.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
yes.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
p.
roddy
i
think
it
is
good
enough
because
it
is...
it
is
a
sufficient
way
to
show
causation.
it
is
not
necessary.
it's
one
way
to
show
causation.
i
agree
with
you.
third
party
reliance
is
one
way.
that
happens
to
be
the
way
we
will
do
it
here
at
trial,
if
given
the
opportunity.
unless
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you.
