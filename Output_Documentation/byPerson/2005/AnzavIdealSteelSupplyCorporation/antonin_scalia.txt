justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
understand
your
answer
then.
i
mean...
i
mean,
does
the
fact
that...
that
there
was
classic
mob
violence
involved
make
a
difference
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i...
your
answer
didn't...
didn't
tell
me
why.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
violence
or
not.
it
has
to
do
with
directness
or
not.
you're
saying
you
would
apply
the
same
directness
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
i'm
impressed
by
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
the
brief,
in
which
someone
causes
a
person
who
has
a
contract
with
a
third
party
to
believe
that
the
third
party
has
repudiated
the
contract,
and
thereby
gets
that
person
to
give
the
contract
to
himself.
now,
in
that
case,
the
person
defrauded
is
the
other
party
to
the
contract,
not
the...
not
the
third
party.
and
yet,
i
suspect
the
third
party
would...
would
be
direct
enough
to
be...
to
be
within
the
protected
scope,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet,
he's
not
defrauded.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
but
it...
it
at
least
contradicts
your
assertion
that
you
have
to
be
the
defrauded
party.
you
acknowledge
that
sometimes
you
don't
have
to
be
the
defrauded
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
customers,
employees,
and
doctors,
as
i
recall.
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
just
customers.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
that
kind
of
connection
that...
that
your...
your
colleague
was...
was
referring
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
here...
here,
the
intimidation
was...
was
not
directed
to
your
customers.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
a...
that's
a
totally
different
situation.
had...
had
your
customers
been
defrauded,
that
would
be
a...
your
customers,
but
you...
there...
there
was
nothing
directed
specifically
at
the
customers
of
your
store.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
they
were
just
cheating
the
state.
what
was
specifically
directed
at
the
customers
of
your
store?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that's...
that's
good,
not
bad.
i
mean,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roddy,
i
thought
that
the
way
you
got
out
of
this
problem
was
what
your
opponent
has
called
careful
pleading.
i
thought
that...
that
what
you
were
saying
was
that
your
client
was
targeted,
that
other
competitors
were
not
targeted,
that
this
is
something
of
a
family...
both
of
these
companies
are
owned
by
the
same
family
and
there's
some
bad
blood.
is...
is
that
part
of
the
background
of
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
part
of
your
complaint
that...
that
the
business
here
was
going
after
your
client
in
particular.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
other
competitors
might
have
been
hurt,
but...
but
the
whole
purpose
of
it
was
to
get
your
client.
that
is
to
say,
your
client
was
in
some
special
way
a
target.
wasn't
that
part
of
your
complaint?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
abandoning
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if...
if
you're
abandoning
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
you're...
then
you're
in
the
soup--
[laughter]
--with...
with
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
all
the
competitors
are
going
to
be
covered.
but
if
you're
not
abandoning
it,
then...
then...
you
know,
then
maybe
we
can
talk
further.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
or,
in...
in
other
words,
your...
your
targeted
argument
doesn't
really
make
sense
unless
there
is
a
family
vendetta.
i
mean,
i...
i
want
to
make
money.
i
don't
care--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
of
my
competitors
i'm...
i'm
hurting
unless
i
have
some
special
reason
to
get
one...
to
get
one...
one.
now,
i
thought
that
was
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
maybe
it's
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that
is
the
only
basis
on
which
they're
targeted.
so
if
there
had
been
18
competitors
in...
in
the
bronx
and
queens,
then
there
would
have
been
18
targets.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
then
we're
back
in
the
soup.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i...
i
find
that
extraordinary
that...
i
claim
to
have
been
defrauded
by
somebody.
he
makes
a
representation
to
me
about
the
value
of
stock.
i
don't
believe
it.
i
really
think
it's
ridiculous.
of
course,
the
stock
is
not
worth
that.
okay?
i
buy
it
anyway,
and
i
can
sue
even
though
i
didn't
believe
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i'm
just
talking
about
what
the
understood
requirements
of
a
fraud
action
were
at
common
law.
mail
fraud,
any
kind
of
fraud.
surely
there
has
to
be
some
reliance
upon
the
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
do
you
say
mail
fraud
does...
does
not
have
with
it
the
normal
common
law
fraud
requirement
of
reliance?
