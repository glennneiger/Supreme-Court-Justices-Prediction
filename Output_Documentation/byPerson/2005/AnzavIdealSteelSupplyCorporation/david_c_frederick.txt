mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
use
of
alleged
fraud
in
the
underpayment
of
taxes
as
the
predicate
for
a
treble
damages
civil
rico
action.
respondent
ideal
steel
concedes
that
it
was
not
defrauded,
but
it,
nonetheless,
claims
lost
profits
when
national
failed
to
pay
state
sales
taxes
and
thereby
offered
a
lower
overall
price
to
consumers.
our
position
is
that
ideal's
injury
is
too
indirect
as
a
matter
of
law
under
rico.
in
reinstating
ideal's
rico
claims
against
national,
however,
the
second
circuit
committed
two
errors.
first,
it
substituted
a
direct
targeting
test
that
credited
the
plaintiff's
allegations
of
intent
instead
of
applying
this
court's
test
for
proximate
causation
in
the
holmes
case.
and
second,
the
second
circuit
permitted
ideal
to
satisfy
the
reliance
requirement
by
invoking
the
state
of
new
york's
reliance
on
the
truth
of
national's
allegedly
false
tax
returns.
both
errors
transformed
civil
rico
into
a
litigation
weapon
of
great
destructive
force
for
defendants
who
will
be
forced
to
defend,
beyond
the
pleading
stages,
damages
claims
of
the
most
attenuated
and
indirect
character.
with
respect
to
our
first
argument,
proximate
cause,
the
court
below
erred
by
not
applying
this
court's
test
in
holmes
and
also
by
failing
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
fraud
is
a
statutory
violation
that...
for
which
the
plaintiff
needs
to
be
within
the
zone
of
interest.
quite
simply,
because
ideal
was
not
the
defrauded
party,
it
is
not
within
the
zone
of
interest
protected
by
the
fraud
statute.
with
respect
to
the
holmes
factors,
for
three
reasons
the...
ideal
steel
is
unable
to
plead
proximate
cause.
first,
in
holmes,
this
court
made
clear
that
where
there's
an
indirect
plaintiff,
the
claims
are
difficult
to
prove
in
terms
of
ascertaining
what
the
level
of
damages
is.
that
is
particularly
true
in
this
case
because
of
the
highly
attenuated
chain
of
causation
that
allege...
that
ideal
alleges
as
a
factual
matter.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
agree,
justice
souter,
and
here's
why.
in
holmes,
the
customers
were
the
ones
who
were
denied
proximate
cause
in
this
decision...
in...
in
the
court's
decision.
they
stood
in
a
direct
line
from
the
harm
that
was
caused
when
the
companies
were
defrauded
and
the
stock
value
caused
the
brokerage
to
go
down.
it
was
completely
foreseeable
that
customers
that
owned
the
shares
in
those
firms
would
also
suffer
direct
harm.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that...
that's
not
so.
there
is,
and
new
york
is
in
between
them
in
this
respect.
if...
ideal
is
asserting
that
because
the
taxes
had
not
been
charged
and
then
paid
to
the
state
of
new
york,
that
national
gained
a
competitive
advantage.
but
i
think
the
court
has
been
clear
that
the
competitive
harms...
and
this
was
true
in
the
associated
general
contracting
case
in
which
the
court
in
holmes
relied
directly...
is
not
going
to
be
sufficient
when
there
are
multiple
steps
in
the
chain.
here,
as
a
factual
matter,
justice
souter,
they
have
to
be
able
to
link
every
individual
sale
for
which
there
was
not
a
tax
paid,
assert
that
that
person
was
wrongfully
not
charged
a
tax.
under
new
york
law,
under
certain
circumstances,
if
a
contractor
has
a
certificate,
it's
not
appropriate
for
the
vendor
in
this
case
to
charge
the
sales
tax.
and
then
they
have
to
be
able
to
show
that
they
would
have
gotten
the
sale--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
this
court
rejected
a
similar
theory
in
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
context
where
it
held
that
a
specific
intent
to
injure
is
not
sufficient
as
a
pleading
matter.
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
where
an
association
had
a...
an...
a
specific
intent
to
harm
the
unions,
that
that
was
not
sufficient
for
invoking
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
the
same
analysis
applies
here
because
what
ideal
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
use
artful
pleading
as
a
way
to
get
around
the
proximate
cause
requirement
through
their
simple
assertions
that
there
are
no,
in
fact,
other
competitors
within
a
three
state
area
and
that
national
was
targeting
them
for
competitive
harm.
they're
attempting
to
evade
the
normal
requirements
for
proximate
cause
that
look
to
whether
or
not
the
direct
injury
is
suffered
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
as
the
briefs
indicate...
and
we're
somewhat
outside
the
record.
as
the
case
some
to
this
court,
it's
on
the
pleadings.
but
the
footnotes
in
the
brief
give
a
little
bit
of
a
flavor
of
what
has
happened
since
then,
and
there
are
audit
proceedings
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
commenced.
it
has
not
commenced
any
kind
of
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
against
national,
nor
has
it
brought
a
rico
action
against
national.
but
there
are
discussions
with
the
state
at
the
level
of
the
auditors
as
to
whether
or
not
any
back
tax
is
owed
and,
if
so,
in
what
amount.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
there
are
in
excess
of
500,000
corporate
income
tax
statements
that
are
issued
by
the
irs
for
underpayment
each
year
and
in
excess
of
6
million
unemployment
underpayment
notices
sent
out.
and
under
ideal's
theory,
each
of
those
would
be
a
predicate
act
for
a
rico
case,
asserting
treble
damages
where
one
competitor
could
use
the
in
terrorem
effect
of
a
rico
claim
simply
because
of
an
underpayment
of
tax
notice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
have
to
assume
that
for
purposes
of
this
pleading
except
insofar
as
it
acknowledges
whether
or
not
a
legal
requirement
is
satisfied,
and
i
think
that
the
cases
of
this
court
and
certainly
the
commentators
have
been
clear
the
court
does
not
need
to
assume
a
fact
for
purposes
of
a
legal
conclusion.
as
the...
as
the
footnotes
indicate,
that
has
not
been
borne
out
by
discovery,
and
there
are,
in
fact,
multiple
competitors.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what
the
second
circuit
held
was
that
if
the
plaintiff
pleads
that
they
were
a
direct
target...
and
here,
other
competitors
in
the
market
like
colonial,
alimar,
friedel,
and
easton
steel,
could
plead
exactly
the
same
thing
that
they,
in
fact,
were
the
direct
target.
and
under
the
second
circuit's
test,
that
would
be
sufficient
to
override
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
proceed
the
parties
into
protracted
discovery.
and
what
the
court
in
associated
general
contracting
and
in
holmes
made
clear
was
that
the
courts
were
not
designed
to
be
the
forums
for
this
kind
of
long,
arduous
fact
finding
mission
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
indirect
injuries
should
be
compensable
with
treble
damages
under
the
rico
statute.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice,
the
way
we
get
to
the
proximate
cause
requirement
through
holmes
is
through
1964(c)'s
use
of
by
reason
of
a
violation
of
1962.
we
submit
that
the
proximate
cause
inquiry
is
the
same
whether
it's
a
62(a)
violation
or
a
62(c)
violation.
and
in
fact,
ideal
has
not
advanced
really
any
argument
to
the
contrary.
they
sued
under
1962(a)
in
order
to
get
a
deeper
pocket,
national,
which
they
would
not
be
able
to
get
under
1962(c).
corporations
are
not
persons.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they...
that's
not
their
allegation,
though,
in
this
sense.
the
theory
that
your
hypothesis
is
postulating
is
a
money
laundering
predicate
act,
but
they
don't
assert
money
laundering
as
the
predicate
act.
they
assert
fraud.
and
it's
exactly
the
same
conduct,
the
alleged
underpayment
of
taxes
that
is
fraudulently
sent
to
the
state
of
new
york,
and
through
that,
an
indirect
injury.
so
their
theory
under
(a)
and
under
(c)
of
section
1962
factually
is
exactly
the
same.
the
only
reason
that
they
brought
in
an
(a)
claim
is,
as
i
pointed
out,
to
get
at
the
pocket
with
suing
national
as
a
corporate
defendant.
but
i
would
point
out
here,
in
further
answer
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
the
state
of
new
york,
under
the
holmes
test,
is
the
proper
plaintiff
for
purposes
of
vindicating
the
law's
purposes,
which
after
all,
is
to
negate
the
activity
of
fraud.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
are
cases
that
have
so
held,
and
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
pasquantino,
which
holds
that
the
tax
revenue
from
a
governmental
entity
can
be
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fraud
statutes,
would
support
a
general
notion
that
a
state
could,
in
fact,
if
it
believed
that
that
was
necessary
to
vindicate
the
law's
purposes
would
be
appropriate.
of
course,
here,
the
state
of
new
york
has
got
to
get
to
that
level
through
a
very
long
series
of
steps,
and
it
hasn't
even
approached,
you
know,
the
initial
steps
in
terms
of
even
bringing
the
civil
claims
against
national.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that,
justice
ginsburg,
may
give
rise
to
certain
legal
remedies
and
certain
harms,
but
we
submit
would
be
too
indirect
for
a
rico
treble
damages
claim.
there
certainly
could
be
an
unfair
competition
claim
under
state
law,
perhaps
a
tortious
interference
with
business
advantage.
but
the
purpose
of
rico
is
not
to
federalize
unfair
competition
law.
and
this
point,
we
submit
is
very
important
because
they
could
not
bring
a
fraud
claim
under
state
law.
it's
not
in
their
complaint,
but--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
could,
justice
alito,
in
this
way.
congress
has
certainly
announced,
through
a
variety
of
statutes,
a
congressional
policy
of
trying
to
deter
and
to
minimize
the
use
of
violence
and
force
against
individuals.
and
the
hobbs
act
is
quite
broadly
worded
in
the
context
of
robbery
and
extortion,
certainly.
the
question,
though,
of
whether
or
not
an
indirectly
sustained
injury...
in
your
hypothetical,
something
like
competitive
advantage...
would
be
sustainable...
i
think
would
be
looked
at
through
the
holmes
inquiry
whether
or
not
the
damages
that
are
asserted
are
too
attenuated
to
be
readily
ascertained.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
can--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
if...
depending
on
the
exact
facts
of
how
the
violence
was
done,
whether
or
not
the
injury
that
is
sustained
is
direct
within
the
holmes
factors--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct,
although
there
is...
justice
scalia,
i
don't
want...
i
don't
think
that
it
should
be
foreclosed
that
as
your
opinion
in
holmes
and
as
footnote
20
of
the
majority
opinion
in
holmes
pointed
out,
how
those
proximate
cause
factors
get
analyzed
with
the
different
predicate
acts
may
vary
slightly,
but
we
think--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
it
would
because
there
is
a
better
defendant
a
which
got
extorted
for
purpose
of
vindicating
the
extortion--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it...
it
does
in
this
extent.
i
can't
think
of
a
hypothetical,
off
the
top
of
my
head
or
after
some
consideration,
of
where
the
violence
would
have
been
such
that
there
would
have
been
a
less
indirect
injury
than
the
one
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
souter.
but
i
would
not
want
to
foreclose
the
possibility,
as
this
court
did
not
foreclose
in
footnote
20
of
the
holmes
opinion,
that
there
could
be
such
a
case.
it's
not
necessary
for
us
to
prevail
here
because
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
predicate
acts
are
very
close
to
the
securities
fraud
that
this
court
considered
in
the
holmes
case.
i
would
acknowledge
that
in
the
extortion
and
robbery
and
other
carjacking
and
violence
type
acts,
there
could
be
congressional
policies
that
would
be
taken
into
account.
and
certainly
the
legislative
history
of
rico
points
to
a
concern
that
persons
would
be
using
violence
in
a
way
that
would
cause
harms.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
go
there
in
order
to
rule
in
our
favor
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
is
starting
to
get
more
indirect,
but
i
think
that
that
probably
would
be
sufficient
to
show
injury
because
the
state
of
new
york
is
not
suffering
any
kind
of
property
loss
or
any
other
kind
of
harm
other
than
honest
services.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i...
i
don't
think
that
that
hypothetical
in
any
substantive
way
is
different
from
the
second
one,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
i...
i
think...
i
think
that
the...
the
question
of
how
government
behaves,
for
purposes
of
its
discharge
of
public
responsibilities,
you
know,
is
treated
through
a
lens
that
goes
to
whether
or
not
the
law
can
be
properly
vindicated
there.
and
i
assume
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
various
laws
that
can
be
enforced
in
a
way--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--not
under...
well,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
by
the
competitor
under
rico
because,
again,
those
damages
are
too
indirect.
that's
not
very
different
from
the
associated
general
contracting
case
where
there
were...
there
was
thought
to
be
coercion
on
the
part
of
the
association
against
the
labor
unions,
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
insufficient
for
proximate
cause.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
think,
justice
breyer,
it
depends
on
how
the
fraud
plays
out,
and...
and
i
would
acknowledge
that
this
is
a...
a
somewhat
nebulous
area
when
you--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
difficulty,
justice
breyer,
as...
as
that
series
of
hypotheticals
plays
out
in
the
real
world
is
that
defendants
who
have
to
defend
against
actions
are
forced
to
deal
with
the
truth
of
pleadings
for
purposes
of
12(b)(6).
and
as
happened
in
this
case,
where
the
plaintiff
can,
through
artful
pleading,
you
know,
navigate
through
these
series
of
proximate
cause
issues,
can
plead
facts
that
courts
have
to
be
assuming
as
true,
reach
a
legal
conclusion
that
there
is,
in
fact,
proximate
cause--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--but,
justice
breyer,
i
guess
my
point
is
that
i
think
that
there...
with
all
candor
to
the
court,
there
are
some
difficulties
in
handling
that
as
a
pleading
matter.
and
yes,
i'll
accept
the
win
if
that's
how
that's
the
court
wants
to
read
the
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but--
[laughter]
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but...
but
i
would
submit
that
the
rule
as
articulated
is
one
that
would
have
some
administration
issues.
i
think
it
is
certainly
an
easier
case
where
there
is
a
broad
spread
competitive
harm
as
a
result
of
a
lowering
of
a
particular
competitor's
costs
or
a
particular
defendant's
costs
and
one
where
there
is
a
fraud
that
is
specifically
directed
at
a
piece
of
property
for
which--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
plaintiff
asserts
a
claim.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
under
the
holmes
test,
that
becomes
much
easier
to
ascertain
because
you
know
where
the
damages
are.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
apportioning
damages
among
multiple
plaintiffs,
and
there
may
not
be
a
better
plaintiff.
so
i
think
if
you
applied
the
holmes
factors
in
this
test
here
and
to
the
example
that
you
gave,
the
answer
is
a
fairly
straightforward
one.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
second
point
of
proximate
cause
that
we
have
raised,
it's
that
as
a
matter
of
zone
of
interest
standing,
because
ideal
is
not
the
defrauded
party,
they
fall
outside
the
zone
of
interests
protected
by
the
fraud
statutes.
it's
been
well
accepted
at
common
law
and
through
this
court's
incorporation
of
common
law
principles
as
a
means
of
interpreting
the
rico
statute,
that
the
predicate
act
should
be
viewed
in
terms
of
who
is
designed
to
be
protected.
here,
because
of
the
allegations
of
fraud
against
the
state
of
new
york,
the
state
of
new
york
is
within
the
zone
of
interest
that
the...
of
the
fraud
provisions.
ideal
is
not.
ideal
falls
outside
the
zone,
and
under
the
way
that
some
courts
have
viewed
proximate
cause
analysis,
that
would
be
sufficient.
the
second
large
point
that
i
came
here
to
argue
today
was
that
reliance
was
improperly
analyzed
by
the
court
below.
at
common
law,
reliance
is
a
necessary
element
of
fraud.
ideal,
for
similar
reasons
to
the
zone
of
interest
analysis,
is
not
the
party
that
relied
on
any
misrepresentations
by
my
client,
national
and
the
anzas.
and
therefore,
it
cannot
assert
a
fraud
claim
because
of
that
absence
of
reliance.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
do,
justice
scalia,
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
but
common
law
cases
have
carved
out
a
very
narrow
exception
where
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
defrauded
party
and
the
entity
that
is
injured.
usually
it's
an
agency
relationship.
sometimes
it's
a
trustee
or
fiduciary
relationship,
but
that
is
a
very
narrow
exception
that
would
fall
within
your
hypothetical
and
would
fall
outside
this
case
because
ideal
cannot
plead
or
prove
any
reliance
whatsoever
on
the
misrepresentations--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--our
briefs
make
that
concession
clear,
i
think,
justice
scalia.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'd
like
to
return
to
justice
souter's
hypothetical
because
i
think
that
the
point
of
price
competition
fits
squarely
within
the
holmes
case.
if
you
were
to
take
the
fact
of
bankruptcy,
the
mere
going
bankrupt
of
the
brokers
in
that
case,
the...
the
effect
of
that
on
the
customers
who
are
attempting
to
bootstrap
in
the
securities
fraud
fits
perfectly
here
because
the
fraud
here
against
the
state
of
new
york
enables
national
allegedly
to
engage
in
price
competition.
but
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
hypothetical,
price
competition
is
not
a
rico
violation.
and
using
1964(c)'s
by
reason
of,
the
injury
has
to
be
by
the
rico
violation.
simply
lowering
prices
or
making
their
goods
more
economically
affordable
does
not
cause...
is
not
a
rico
violation.
the...
the
rico
violation,
if
there
is
one
here,
is
in
the
fraudulent
underpayment
of
taxes
to
the
state
of
new
york.
the
sg's
brief
in
the
bank
of
china
case
does,
we
acknowledge,
make
the
suggestion
about
possible
third
party
reliance,
but
it
does
not
cite
any
decision
of
this
court.
it
cites
two
court
of
appeals
cases,
one
of
which
is
the
decision
below,
which
we
argue
was
wrongly
decided.
the
point
that
the
sg,
i
think,
was
making
was
acknowledging
that
there
are
these
circumstances,
and
i
would
advert
to
my
earlier
colloquy
with
justice
scalia
in
which
there
are
limited
circumstances
in
which
a
third
party
can
invoke
the
reliance.
but
that
is
ordinarily
done
through
a
relationship
among
the
parties.
the
breadth
of
the
respondent's
position
here
should
not
go
uncommented
upon.
rico
is
not
an
unfair
competition
statute.
yet,
the
answers
to
the
hypotheticals
about
how
many
competitors
would
be
able
to
bring
and
whether
or
not
they
were
directly
targeted
and
the
cigarette
hypothetical
all
point
to
the
fact
that,
at
bottom,
their
theory
is
that
any
action
on
the
part
of
a
defendant
that
leads
to
an
indirect
ability
to
engage
in
price
competition
would
give
rise
to
a
rico
claim.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
there
are
literally
millions...
just
on
taxes
alone,
millions...
of
submissions
by
corporations
that
could
be
used
by
competitors
if
the
direct
targeting
test
is
accepted
by
this
court
as
the
predicate
for
a
rico
claim.
we
submit
that
the
floodgates
should
not
be
opened
in
that
way,
particularly
given
the
fact
that
the
difficulties
of
proving
harm
and
damages
are
especially
present
here
and
that
antitrust
cases
should
not
be
shoehorned
under
the
rico
statute.
that
is
not
what
congress
intended.
finally,
with
respect
to
reliance,
this
court
in
beck
v.
prupis
held
that
civil
conspiracy
principles
should
be
imported
into
the
understanding
of
what
a
civil
action
under
rico
should
be
permitted.
and
the
common
law
is
well
settled
that
reliance
is
an
element
that
is
appropriate
for
it
to
be
imported
into
the
mail
fraud
predicate
act
here
because
the
damages
have
to
be
shown
by
some
type
of
relationship
between
the
defrauded
party
and
the
defendant.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
