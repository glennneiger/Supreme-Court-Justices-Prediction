justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
this
is
a
little
more
focused
than
that,
i
think.
there's
only
one
competitor
here,
isn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
it's
fair
to
interpret
the
second
circuit
as
having,
in
effect,
held
that
every
competitor
of
anybody
who
cheats
on
his
taxes
has
a
rico
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this?
i
assume
you
would
agree
that
if
the
defendant
had...
had
hired
a
thug
to
go
out
and
beat
up
his
competitor,
the
competitor
would
have
a
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if
the
defendant
bribed
a...
an
official
of
the
new
york
revenue
department
to
impose
unnecessarily
high
taxes
on
the
competitor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if
they...
what
if
they
somehow
or
other
fraudulently
persuaded
the
revenue
agents
of
the
state
to
impose
higher
taxes
and
penalties
on
the
competitor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
there
would
be
recovery
in
that
scenario.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
we've
got
a
license
inspector
or
somebody
every
monday
night
to
go
out
and...
and
inspect
very
heavily
the
competitor
and
cause
all
sorts
of
nuisance
values
and
so
forth.
but
he's
a
state
official,
induced
to
do
that
by
some
kind
of
bribery
or
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
would
there
be
a
cause
of
action
there
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you
are
claiming
a
different
amount
of
damages,
entirely
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'd
like
to
ask
you
supposing
there
were
two
competitors
in
the
market
instead
of
just
the
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
they
did
it
just
to
get
at...
at
the
competitor
a
and
didn't
care
about
b,
but
b
suffered
exactly
the
same
harm,
would
b
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
has
exactly
the
same
causation
as
a,
but
he
just
didn't
happen
to
be
a
target
in
the...
in
the
mind
of
the
defendant.
would
he--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
it'd
be
true
if
there
were
20
competitors
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
imagine
the
damages
would
be
less,
but
why
would
it
be
any
different
analytically?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
change
it
one
other
way.
say,
instead
of
defrauding
new
york,
they
defrauded
the
landlord
and...
and
got
a
rent
free
office
space,
and
that
cut
down
their
costs.
would
the
competitors
have
a
cause
of
action
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
it
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
sending
out
thugs
to
beat
them
up
or
something
like
that.
