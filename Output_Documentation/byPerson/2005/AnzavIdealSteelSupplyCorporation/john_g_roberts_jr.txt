chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
04-433,
anza
v.
ideal
steel
supply
corporation.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
frederick,
i
understand
how
your
arguments
work
under
section
1962(c),
but
how...
how
do
they
work
under
1962(a)?
it
seems
that
that
gets
around
many
of
the
causation
and
reliance
arguments
that
you
make.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
62(a)
gets
to
the
reinvestment
of
the
illicit
proceeds
in
a...
in
an
enterprise,
and
here
you
have
the
opening
of
the
facility
right
next...
not
right
next
door...
nearby
the
other
facility.
and
it
seems
to
me
all
they
have
to
show
is
that
the
proceeds
used
for
that
were
illicitly
procured.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
the
reason
justice
breyer's
test
is
a
little
more
administrable
than
you're
willing
to
admit
is
that
it's
not
a
question
of
motive.
you're
not
asking
why
they
did
it.
you're
asking
where
the
predicate
act
is
directed,
and
if
the
predicate
act
is
directed
to
lowering
the...
the
firm's
taxes
so
that
it
can
compete
more
aggressively,
that's
one
thing.
if
the...
the
predicate
act
is
directed
to,
you
know,
blowing
up
the
other
firm's
warehouse
or...
or,
you
know,
something
like
that,
it's
a
different
matter
altogether.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
roddy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
they're
tax
free
they
might.
[laughter]
i
mean,
that's
the
whole
point
is
that
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
fraud
gives
him
a
competitive
advantage
not
just
over
the,
you
know...
his...
his
brother
in
law's
company
that
he's
trying
to
get
at,
but
over
everybody
who's
in
the
business.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're'...
they're
one
more
step
removed.
i
don't
know
if
they're
one
step
removed.
i
mean,
if
there
were
no
allegations
of
motive
or
family
feud
or
targeting
and
all
we
know
is
that
there
are
two
competitors
there
and
the
one
underpaid
its
taxes,
is
your
case
still
viable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
depend
on
motive
or
targeting
or
anything
at
all.
it
just
depends
on
the
fortuity
of
there
being
two
competitors
in
a
particular
area.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you've
cited
the
solicitor
general's
brief--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--earlier.
the
solicitor
general
says
it's
inherent
in
the
concept
of
proximate
cause.
in
the
absence
of
reliance,
you
don't
have
proximate
cause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
the
case
is
submitted.
