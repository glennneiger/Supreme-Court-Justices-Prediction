mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
my
time
today,
i'd
like
to
focus
on
two
basic
issues.
the
first
is
that
this
case
does
not
approach
the
outer
limit
of
due
process
set
by
this
court
in
chambers.
as
the
trial
court
found
in
three
specific
instances,
there
is
no
evidence
to
corroborate
these
confessions.
and
the
confession
evidence
itself
in
chambers
was
far
stronger
than
the
confession
evidence
in
this
case.
second,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
the
nature
of
the
supreme
court
of
carolina's
opinion
and
to
remind
the
court
that
it's
reviewing
the
judgment
primarily,
not
the
opinion.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
petitioner's
argument
is
essentially
criticizing
the
opinion
for
the
absence
of
a
word,
the
absence
of
the
word
automatically,
and
that
the
opinion
would
look
very
different
if
it
said
where
there's
strong
evidence
of
guilt,
the
defendant's
third
party
guilt
evidence
doesn't
automatically
raise
a
reasonable
inference
of
innocence.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
we...
we
believe
that
the
raise
a
reasonable
inference
of
innocence
standard,
as
the
counsel
for
south
carolina
said,
does
not
necessarily
require
that
it
be
the
only
inference--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--and
i
think
your
formulation
is
actually
a
fair
one.
does
it
raise
some--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--the
second
one,
does
it
raise
some
reasonable
possibility
of
innocence.
in
other
words,
if
you
believe
this
evidence--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--does
it
raise
a
reasonable
possibility
of
innocence,
not...
not
that
it's
the
most
likely
or
the
only
possibility
from
that
evidence.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
south
carolina
supreme
court's
opinion
carefully,
in
light
of
the...
the
supreme
court's
decisions
in
gregory
and
gay,
you
see
that
in
fact
what
the
court
was
doing
was
simply
saying
this
case
is
like
gay.
there's
strong
evidence.
we're
going
to
look
at
the
evidence
on
both
sides.
and
there's
a...
there
is
certainly
language
in
the
opinion
that
makes
it
sound
like
an
automatic
or
categorical
rule,
but
in
fact,
they
did
go
on
to
look
at
the
defendant's
evidence.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
the
trial
court
certainly
looked
at
the
defendant's
evidence.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that...
that
any
of
the
nine
states
collected
in
our
appendix
whose
standard
is
does
the
evidence
raise
a
reasonable
inference
of
innocence
look
at
those
sorts
of
questions.
in
addition,
we
collected,
i
believe,
four
cases
in
our
brief,
in
addition
to
the
california
court
of
appeal
and
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion
in
cabrera.
there's
the
kansas
v.
adams
case
which
very
clearly
looks
at
the
state
evidence.
in
that
case,
the
issue
was
the
defendant
was
on
trial
for
shaking
his
baby
to
death,
and
the
medical
evidence
of
the
prosecution
showed
that
the
death
took
place
within
a
certain
time
period.
the
defendant
wanted
to
introduce
evidence
that
his
wife--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
i
think
its
reasoning
stands
on
its
own,
your
honor.
but
in
addition
to
that
case,
you
have
these
other
three
published
cases,
and
we
stand
by
the
description
of
them
in
our
argument.
kansas
v.
adams
was
a
case
where
the
court
said
the
issue...
the
state's
evidence
shows
this
baby
died
within
a
certain
time
period,
and
although
the
wife
had
a
history
of
violence
against
the
child,
the
court
said
it's
not
getting
in
because
it's...
there's
no
evidence
that
she
had
access
to
the
child
during
the
relevant
time
period.
that's
a
very
clear
example.
there
are
other
examples.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
i...
i
think
it
would
be
within
the...
the
trial
court's
discretion
to
exclude
it.
i
certainly
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
violate
the
due
process--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--it's
not
our
position,
your
honor,
that...
that
the
trial
court
can
make
credibility
determinations,
but--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--i...
i
think,
though...
i...
i
suppose
that
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
specific
evidence
at
issue.
if
you
look
at
the
evidence--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
i...
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
trial
judge
found
that...
that
there
simply
wasn't
a
dispute
about
that,
that...
that
the...
that
there
wasn't
enough.
and
so
it
was
fine
to
look
at
the
state's
case.
and
i
would
urge
the
court--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and...
and
we
would...
we
would
simply
urge
the
court
not
to
adopt
a
categorical
rule
that
it's
inappropriate
to
look
at
the
state's
case.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
yes,
and...
and--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--and
that's
why--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--and
that's
why
i
would
emphasize
the
trial
court's
findings
in
this
case.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
it's
very
clear.
this
is
at
pages
136
and
137
of
the
joint
appendix,
page
140
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
again
at
pages
252
and
253
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
trial
court
said
there
is
nothing
to
corroborate
these
confessions.
now,
contrast
chambers--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--possibly--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--possibly
that
evidence
would
be
sufficient
to
support
an
indictment,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
sufficient
to
support
a
conviction.
and
i
also
think
that
it's...
it's...
we're
talking
about
the
outer
limits
of
due
process
here.
if
you
look
at
the
evidence
in
chambers,
the
corroboration
evidence
there
was
extensive.
there
was
a
witness
who
said
i
saw
the
third
party
shoot
the
victim.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
no.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
right,
your
honor,
and...
and
that...
that
might
present
a
different
case.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
but...
but
that
evidence--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--i'm
saying,
your
honor,
that
the
evidence
here
clearly
isn't
strong
enough
to
meet
the
standard
for
due
process,
quite
apart
from
whether
it's
enough
to
support
an
indictment
or
a
conviction.
and
if
you
compare
it
with
the
evidence
in
chambers,
that's
very
clear
where
there
was
eyewitness
testimony
of
the
shooting
itself.
there
was
eyewitness
testimony
that
the
third
party
was
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
with
the
gun
in
his
hand.
there
was...
there
was
testimony
from
the
gun
dealer
that
he
sold
the
person
the
type
of
crime
at
issue...
the
type
of
gun
at
issue
both
before
and
after
the
offense.
the
confession
itself,
in
contrast
to
the
evidence
here,
was
a
sworn
statement.
there
was
not
even
any
dispute
as
to
whether
the...
the
confession
was
made.
the
only
dispute
was
whether
the
evidence
of
the
confession
was
true.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
no,
i...
if
i
may
answer.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
it
was
part
of
the
hearsay
analysis,
but
it's
a
narrower
ground
that's...
that's
fully
supportable
by
the
record
for
affirmance
because
it
distinguishes
the
evidence
in
chambers.
