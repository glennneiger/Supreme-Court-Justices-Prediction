chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
holmes
v.
south
carolina.
mr.
blume.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
where...
where
in
the
record
is
the
testimony
of
the
fbi
agents
that
you
were
referring
to?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where...
where
do
you
think
it
says
you
have
to
overcome
the
prosecution's
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a...
it's
a
factor
that's
considered
in
weighing
the
admissibility
and
relevance
of
the
third
party
guilt.
they
don't...
you
don't
have
to
prove
and
rebut
and
overcome,
as
you've
said
a
couple
of
times,
the
prosecution's
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
say
you
don't
object
to
the...
the
gregory
standard,
and
the
gregory
standard
is
the
one
justice
souter
just
quoted,
raise
a
reasonable
inference
as
to
his
own
innocence.
now,
how
can
you
tell
whether
it
raises
a
reasonable
inference
in
a
vacuum
without
regard
to
the
evidence
on
the
other
side?
if
the
evidence
on
the
other
side
is...
i
understand
you
dispute
it
in
this
case,
but
let's
say
unobjectionable
dna
evidence
that
your
client
was
the
person
there,
and
his
third
party
guilt
evidence
is
it
wasn't
me.
how
can
you
tell
whether
that
creates
a
reasonable
inference
or
not
without
looking
at
what's
on
the
other
side?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
not
at
all.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
evidence
has
to
be...
the
admissibility
of
evidence
has
to
be
assessed
in
light
of
the
circumstances.
if
your
claim
of
innocence
is,
as
it
may
be
in
this
case,
that
the
dna
evidence
doesn't
show
what
you
think
it
shows,
fine,
that
evidence
comes
in.
if
the
evidence
you're
trying
to
get
in
is
somebody
in
the
jailhouse
said
he
heard
that
somebody
else
did
it,
and
the...
and
you
don't
challenge
the
dna
evidence
that
places
your
client
there,
then
maybe
that
doesn't
create
a
reasonable
inference,
while
it
might
in
a
different
case,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
prosecution's
evidence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
the...
that's
the
problem.
that's
why
this
is
a
special
category
of
evidence.
it's
not
any
evidence.
it's
third
party
guilt
evidence
because
that's
evidence
that
any
defendant
could
try
to
introduce
in
any
case.
in
any
case,
the
defendant
can
say
somebody
else
did
it
and
compile
whatever
kind
of
evidence
he
can
get,
whether
it's
jailhouse
informants
or...
or
whatever,
where
the
person
who
did
it
was
often
somebody
who's
just
recently
died
and...
and
is
not
there
to
present
an
alibi
of
his
own.
in
every
case
the
defendant
can
come
up
with
this
evidence,
and
so
you
have
a
special
rule
that's
designed
to
deal
with
that.
and
all,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
state
court
decision
is
saying,
when
you
look
at
the
prosecution's
case,
is
if...
if
the
prosecution's
case
makes
that
an...
unreasonable
under
the
gregory
test
that
you
agree
with,
the
reasonable
inference,
if
it's
unreasonable
to
suggest
that
somebody
else
did
it,
doesn't
mean
that
you're
guilty.
you
may
have
all
sorts
of
other
claims
that
you
can
make,
but
you
just
don't
get
to
present
that
type
of
evidence
because
of
the
susceptibility
of
prejudice
and
the
susceptibility
of
fraud
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
mean
on...
in
your
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
say
in...
you
cited
us
to
footnote
8
in
the
court's
opinion,
and
it
says
that
your
claims
do
not
eliminate
the
fact
that
99.99
percent
of
the
population,
other
than
your
client
and
the
victim,
were
excluded
as
contributors
to
the
dna
evidence
that
was
found.
do
you...
is...
is
the
court
wrong
in
saying
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
blume.
mr.
zelenka.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
zelenka.
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
johnson.
mr.
blume,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
your...
your
case
hinge
upon
your
challenge
to
the
dna
evidence?
in
other
words,
if
you
don't
have
the
suggestion
that
the
dna
evidence
was
manipulated,
would
you
agree
that
in
that
case
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
could
be
kept
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
would
it
be...
i
mean,
if
it
meets
the
standard
for
harmless,
it
suggests
that
it
didn't
make
a
difference,
would
not
have
been
likely
to
make
a
difference
with
the
jury,
and
therefore
it
could
have
been
excluded
in
the
first
instance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
exactly
what
the
rule
is
designed
to
prevent?
in
other
words,
you
have
no
challenge
to
the
dna
evidence,
and
yet
you
bring
up
some
third
party
guilt
evidence.
and
your
suggestion
just
now
is,
well,
the
jury
might
think
maybe
there's
not
that
much
to
the
dna
evidence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
it
gets
them
off
on
a
detour
and
distracts
their
attention
from
the
evidence
that
is
before
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
