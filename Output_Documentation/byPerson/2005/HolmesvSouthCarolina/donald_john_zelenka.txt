mr.
donald
john
zelenka
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
constitution
guarantees
criminal
defendants
under
the
due
process
clause,
compulsory
process,
and
confrontation
clauses
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
present
a
defense.
a
defendant's
right
to
present
relevant
evidence
is
not
unlimited,
however,
but
is
rather
subject
to
reasonable
restrictions.
state
courts
as
rulemakers
have
broad
latitude
to
establish
rules
excluding
evidence
so
long
as
they
are
not
arbitrary
or
disproportionate.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
it
was
merely
an
application
of
the
original
opinion
that
relied
upon
the
straight...
state
v.
gregory,
that
in
fact
it
must
raise
a
reasonable
inference
as
to
the
defendant's
innocence.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
think
that...
that
language
was
basically
a
review
determination
as
to
what
exactly
happened.
i
don't
think
that
the
court--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--no,
i
don't
disagree
with
the
fact
that,
in
fact,
that
is
what
the
supreme
court
said
in
its
analysis,
looking
at
the
particular
evidence
in
this
case,
that
he
was
unable
to
overcome
that.
but
i
think
state
v.
gregory
didn't
require
that
to
be
the
ultimate
threshold
that
it
had
to
meet,
rather
that
it
raise
a
reasonable
inference
as
to
his
innocence.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it's
raising
a
possibility.
i
don't
know
what
level
of
possibility
it
is
other
than
a
reasonable
inference
level,
which
is
a
level
which...
which
means
that
it's
subject
to
some
belief.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
reads
certainly
like
a
universal
proposition,
but
i
think
it
is
merely
an
application
of
what
happened
in
state
v.
gregory
and
state
v.
gay
when
they
were
presented
at
that
time
in
those
situations
with
what
they
determined
to
be
strong
evidence
of
forensic
guilt--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--i
would
agree
that
would
be
a
strange
proposition
because
it
suggests
that
they
would
ignore
the
merits
of...
of
the
proffered
evidence
itself.
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
think
that's--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--absolutely.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
doesn't--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
and
i
think
we
also
have
to
remember
that
the...
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
was
viewing
this
simply
as
a
matter
of
state
common
law.
they
weren't
looking
at
it
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i...
i
think
we
can
look
at
a
much
narrower
approach
that
also
evolves
out
of
this
particular
judgment
as
determined
by
the
trial
court.
there
was
essentially
a...
a
lack
of
persuasive
assurances
of
trustworthiness
in
the
statements
that
were,
in
fact,
given.
they
lacked
corroboration,
the
particular
statements
that
were
alleged
to
have
been
given
by
jimmy
mccaw
white,
in
ways
similar
to
situations
where
evidence
should
not
be
deemed
relevantly
admissible
because
of
that
lack
of
reliability
and
trustworthiness.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
it
didn't
say
that.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
trial
judge
said
that.
the
trial
judge
said
it
lacked
the
type
of
corroboration.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
he
was...
he...
he
did
that
also,
but
ultimately
he
blended
both
concepts
together
and
said
both
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law
and
as
a
matter
of
evidentiary
law
in
the...
the
final
conclusion
at
the
end
of
the
state's
case,
when
he
made
the
ultimate
determination--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that
it
would
be
inadmissible.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
they
didn't
specifically
address
that.
they
went
to
their
ultimate
determination
viewing
the
evidence.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it...
they
said
that
the
evidence
existed,
that
the
statements--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--there
was
some
evidence--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that
allowed
for--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that
allowed
for
a
jury
to
make
the
determination.
that
information
was
there.
but
also,
it's...
the
judge
found
that
there
wasn't
other
evidence
other
than
the
statement
that
clearly
pointed
to
the
defendant...
excuse
me...
that
clearly
pointed...
pointed
to
jimmy
mccaw
white--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--as
being
guilty
of
the
crime.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
think
they
would
have
still
held
the
third
party
evidence
inadmissible
because
of
the
lack
of
corroboration.
it
lacked
that
requirement
of
reliability
to
get
over--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--and
they
gave
that
immediately
after
they
had
issued
their
prior
opinion
in...
in
state
v.
gay
where
they
looked
at
a
case
where,
again,
they
found
overwhelming
forensic
evidence
of
guilt
as
defeating
the
probative
value
of
the
defendant's
presentation.
and
trial
counsel--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--no,
i...
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
and...
and
we've
cited
in
our
brief
kansas
v.
adams.
we...
we
do
not
analyze
those
cases
to
make
a
determination
as
to
what
the
trial
judges
and
the
other
state
courts
did
not
look
at.
we
think
it's
implicit,
in
fact,
in
most
situations,
that
you
have
to
consider
to
some
extent
the
state's
evidence
to
determine
the
reliability
of
the
nature
of
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
which
comes
in.
you
have
to
have--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--some
understanding
of
that
evidence.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
think
there
is
something
special
about
third
party
guilt.
alibi
is
merely
the
defendant
saying
i
didn't
do
it
and
i
wasn't
there
when
the
crime
was
done.
i
think
in
third
party
guilt
evidence
you're
diverting
the
case
off
in
another
direction
that
requires
some
special
attention
by
the
courts,
and
i
think
most
states
recognize
it
requires
special
attention
by
the
court
because
it's
hitting
on
a
collateral
issue
requiring
the
state
to
prove
or,
to
some
extent,
disprove
that
another
individual
did
it,
an
individual
that
might
not
be
subject
to
notice
requirements,
an
individual
that
might
not
even
be
alive.
we
look
at...
you
can
look
at
the...
this
court's
decision
in
donnelly
v.
the
united
states,
a
1911
decision,
that
recognized
there's
something
different
about
third
party
guilt
potential
evidence
because
of
the
inherent
unreliability
which
may
exist
in
the
manner
and
the
way
it
was
presented.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
they
can.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no.
i
think...
i
think
this
court
excluded
it
on
the
basis
of
reliability
determinations,
whether
in
fact
there
was
sufficient
corroboration
for
what
the
individual
was
saying
in
the
statement.
the
trial
judge
found
that
the
information
that
was
purported
to
be
said
by
jimmy
mccaw
white
was
something
that
was
generally
known
within
the
community
as
a
whole.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
think
they
could
evaluate
the
evidence
in
the
manner
that
it...
that
it
was
presented
to
them
to
get
an
indicia
as
to
whether
there
is
any
reasonable
reliability
to
the
third
party
guilt
evidence.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
well,
i
think
that
type
of
evaluation,
we
believe,
necessarily
needs
to
be
done
to
make
a
determination
to
the...
to
the
probative
value
or
the
prejudicial
value
to
the
presentation
of
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
of...
of
the
defendant,
that
all
those
matters
need
to
be
looked
at
as
to
whether,
in
fact,
it
should
come
in.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
if
there
was
just
the
palm
print--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--no.
i
don't
think
that's
the
test,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
they
were
doing
in
this
case.
they
were
making
that...
viewing
that
information
to
determine
whether
the
presentation
was
reliable
that
was
being
presented,
whether
there
was
some
substance
actually
to
what
was
being
given,
and
whether
leaving
that
information
out
would
have
deprived
him
of
a
meaningful
right
to
present
relevant
evidence
in
his
defense.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the...
the...
it's...
it's
evidence
for
the
defense,
but
it's
evidence
for
the
defense
that
lacked
the
sense
of
reliability.
and
it
lacked--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--he...
he--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--it's
some
evidence
for
the
defense,
but
the
problem
is
it
lacked
corroboration.
it
wasn't
given
in
a
timely
manner.
if
you
contrast
that
to
the
situation
which
occurred
in
chambers
v.
mississippi,
there
was
an
entire
information
that
the
chambers
situation
had
independent
of
the
third
party
statement
which
supported
and
showed
that
that
information
did
have
persuasive
assurances
of
reliability.
that
was
lacking
in
this
particular
case.
i
see
my
time
is
about
up,
but
i
would--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--no.
he
specifically
found,
i
believe,
from
my
reading--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that
it
didn't
meet
the
gregory
standard.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
actually
gay
was...
two
things.
gay
was
not
the
standard
when
the
trial
judge
made
the
pretrial
hearing.
gay
was...
was
the
standard
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried,
and
the
trial
judge
was
addressing
that
standard
and
he
found
that
gay
was
not
satisfied
because
he
didn't
believe
that
there
was
evidence
which
clearly
pointed
to
the
defendant...
excuse
me...
to
the
third
party
as
being
guilty
of
the
particular
crime.
he
made
that--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--other
than
that
information
in
the
confession,
which
he
had
also
found
previously
lacked
appropriate
corroboration
at
the
trial...
pretrial
hearing
as
evidenced
within
his
written
order.
i
would
also
like
to
preserve
the
ability
to
argue
harmless
error,
as
we've
done
in
our
case
to
some
extent.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court's
opinion
was
a
harmless
error
analysis,
but
more
importantly,
in
addition,
that...
that
we
do
not
believe
and
continue
to
assert
that
the
matter
wasn't
properly
preserved
before
this
court
based
upon
the
manner
and
only
the
manner
that
it
was
raised
before
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
the
direct
appeal
briefs.
