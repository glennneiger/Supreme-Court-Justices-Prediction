justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
is
it
your
argument
that
the
state's
evidence
can't
be
considered
at
all,
or
that
it
can't
be
given
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
weight?
and
if
it's
the
latter,
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
the
state
doesn't
go
that
far.
if
it
doesn't
require
the
defendant
to
persuade
the
judge
of
the
defendant's
likely
innocence,
then
there's
no
constitutional
violation.
if
the...
if
the
rule
of
state
law
simply
requires
a
consideration
of
the
strength
of
the
prosecution
evidence
in
relation
to
the
defense
evidence,
that's...
that's
all
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
where
is
the
line?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
if
it's...
if
the
rule
is
that
the
defendant
has
to
raise
a
reasonable
inference
of
innocence
and
you
take
into
account
the
strength
of
a
prosecution's
case
in
making
that
determination,
you
don't
just
accept
the
defense
evidence
and...
and
see
whether...
how...
how
strong
an
inference
of
innocence
it
would
raise
if
it's
believed.
i
mean,
where
is
the
line?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that
would
be
unconstitutional
as
well.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
makes
it
sound
like
it
can't
be
considered
at
all.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
there
wasn't
much
evidence
against
him
other
than
the
forensic
evidence.
isn't
that
right?
there's
just
some
people
who
saw
him
nearby.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
jury
must
have
found
that
forensic
evidence
to
be
very
convincing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can...
can
a
trial
judge
exclude
defense
evidence
based
on
credibility
determinations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that...
but
isn't
that
what
happened
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
could...
how
could
court
conclude
that
the
state's
evidence
was
strong
without
making...
without
finding,
in
effect,
that
the
state's
forensic
witnesses
were
credible?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
just
take,
for
example,
the...
the
palm
print.
the
chief
mobley
said
he
found
it
in...
in
the
apartment,
and
that
would
be
very
strong
evidence,
if
in
fact
that
was
the
case.
but
his
credibility
was
contested.
so
how
can
you
conclude
that
the
palm
print
is
strong
evidence
for
the
prosecution
without
implicitly
making
a
determination,
a
credibility
determination?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
then
the
court
is
making--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
court
is
excluding
defense
evidence
based
on
a
finding
that
a
prosecution
witness
is
credible.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
on
the
other
side,
if
westbrook
is
credible,
isn't
that
strong
evidence
for
the
defense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--it
be
credible
that
white
confessed
to
him--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--then
wouldn't
that
be
strong
evidence
for
the
defense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
at
petitioner’s
south
carolina
trial
for
the
murder
of
86-year-old
mary
stewart,
the
prosecution
relied
heavily
on
forensic
evidence
that
strongly
supported
petitioner’s
guilt.
petitioner
attempted
to
undermine
the
forensic
evidence,
and
he
introduced
evidence
that
another
man
had
attacked
stewart.
the
trial
court
excluded
petitioner’s
third-party
guilt
evidence,
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
affirmed.
citing
both
its
decisions
in
gregory
and
gay,
it
held
that
where
there
is
strong
forensic
evidence
of
the
defendant’s
guilt,
proffered
evidence
about
a
third-party’s
alleged
guilt
does
not
raise
a
reasonable
inference
as
to
the
defendant’s
own
innocence.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
the
constitution
guarantees
criminal
defendants
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
present
a
complete
defense;
that’s
from
crane
vs.
kentucky.
this
right
is
abridged
by
evidence
rules
that
are
arbitrary
or
disproportionate
to
the
purposes
they
are
designed
to
serve.
but
well-established
evidence
rules
permit
trial
judges
to
exclude
evidence
if
its
probative
value
is
outweighed
by
unfair
prejudice,
confusion
of
the
issues
or
potential
to
mislead
the
jury.
an
example
of
this
is
found
in
rules
regulating
the
admission
of
third-party
guilt,
rules
which
are
widely
accepted
and
not
challenged
here.
in
gregory,
the
state
supreme
court
adopted
and
applied
a
rule
intended
to
be
of
this
type.
in
gay
and
this
case,
however,
the
court
radically
changed
and
extended
the
gregory
rule.
under
this
new
rule,
the
trial
judge
does
not
focus
on
the
probative
value
or
the
potential
adverse
effects
of
the
third-party
guilt
evidence;
instead,
if
the
prosecution’s
case
is
strong
enough,
the
third-party
guilt
evidence
is
excluded,
even
if
independently
it
would
have
great
probative
value
and
would
not
pose
an
undue
risk
of
harassment,
prejudice
or
confusion.
this
rule
seems
to
call
for
little,
if
any,
examination
of
the
creditability
of
the
prosecution’s
witnesses
or
the
reliability
of
its
evidence,
and
by
evaluating
the
strength
of
only
one
party’s
evidence,
no
logical
conclusion
can
be
reached
regarding
the
strength
of
contrary
evidence
offered
to
rebut
or
cast
doubt.
the
rule
is
arbitrary
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
rationally
serve
the
end
that
other
third-party
guilt
rules
were
designed
to
further,
and
the
state
has
not
identified
any
other
legitimate
end
served
by
the
rule.
the
rule
thus
violates
a
criminal
defendant’s
right
to
have
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
present
a
complete
defense.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
