justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
everything
in
this
case
were
the
same.
everything
is
identical
except
what
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
state
supreme
court
holds
is
that
we
think
under
rule
403,
which
happens
to
be
the
rule
in
our
state,
the
probative
value
doesn't
warrant
admissibility
in
light
of
the
risk
of
prejudice.
but
everything
else
is
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
in
your
opinion
is
that
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
they'll
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
they
want
to
build
it
out,
is
they'll
say,
look,
there...
there
is
dna
evidence
here.
it's
absolutely
conclusive,
and
all
that
the
light...
the...
the
only
doubt
of
the...
the
defense
has
cast
on
it
is
they
found
that
there
was
some
opportunity
that
the
police
could
have
tampered
with
it.
that's
true
of
60
percent
or
so
of
all
chain
of
custody
cases,
and
that
is
not
sufficient
to
overcome
what
it
shows.
and
therefore,
it's
not
worth
the
jury's
time
and
it'll
prove
very
confusing
to
the
jury.
now,
why
would
that
ruling
under
403
be
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
now,
that's
what
i
want
you
to
get
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
key
points
that
suggest
that
what
i
just
said
is
not
a
fair
characterization
or
a
correct
characterization
are?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
point
is
that
we're
quibbling
with
the
language.
certainly
the
language
can't
be
right.
i
mean,
gregory
is
quoting
america...
am.
jur.
it's
totally
right.
and
i
don't...
in
my
opinion.
i
don't
see
how
there's
a
problem.
it's
simply
a
way
to
prevent
the
defendant
from
confusing
the
jury
with
evidence
that's
not...
doesn't
have
high
probative
value.
that's...
so
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
don't
agree
with
that
necessarily,
but
i'm
taking
that
as
a
premise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
he
describes
this,
the
writer
of
the
opinion,
and
if
i
hadn't
been
guilty
of
this
sin
myself,
i
couldn't
criticize
others,
but
he
uses
language
that's
absolute.
he
says,
where
there
is
strong
evidence
of
an
appellant's
guilt,
especially
where
there's
strong
forensic
evidence,
the
proffered
evidence
about
a
third
party's
alleged
guilt
does
not
raise
a
reasonable
inference
as
to
the
appellant's
own
innocence.
i
took
that
to
mean
doesn't
tend
to
show
that
the
appellant
is
innocent.
and
you
do
have
to
have
when
faced
with
guilt.
it's
not
relevant
if
it
doesn't
tend
to
show
he's
innocent.
so
that
wasn't
the
problem.
the
problem
is
that
this
sentence
is
wrong.
you
could
have
incredibly
strong
evidence
that
this
person
is
guilty
and
it
could
be
incredibly
strong
evidence
that
the
other
person
did
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
it
should
come
right
in.
so
what
should
have
been
there
is
the
word
automatically,
the
word
doesn't
automatically
show,
but
the
word
isn't
there.
it
doesn't
say
automatic.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
goes
on
to
write
as
if
it
isn't
that
automatic.
and
he
then
favors
you
because
he
says
the
standards
set
out
in
gregory
and
gay,
as
if
they
aren't
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
language
says
they
are
different.
so
what
do
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
do
we
do?
we
get
the...
we
read
the
opinion
literally,
and
moreover,
that's
why
i
asked
it.
if
you
look
into
the
evidence,
it
looks...
you
know,
maybe
it's
closer
than
you
might
think.
and
if
we
start
looking
at
the
evidence
in
every
case
in
the
united
states,
it's
going
to
be
a
problem
for
everybody.
but...
but...
so
what
do
we
do?
that's
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
i
do
in
this
case?
i'm
totally
with
you
if
i
read
american
jurisprudence
and
others
as
saying
the
following.
judge,
there's
a
particular
kind
of
evidence
that
really
has
a
tendency
to
mislead
the
jury,
that's
that
somebody
else
did
it
because
they
start
trying
the
other
person
in
their
minds.
so
if
you
have
a
strong
case
that
this
guy
did
it,
don't
let
them
even
introduce
that
evidence
unless
you
have
some
reason
to
think
it's
really
going
to
show
this
guy
didn't
do
it.
that's
what
it's
saying,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
that
gets
us
through
gregory.
and
the
difficulty
here
is
that
the
court
went
on
to
say
something
that
couldn't
possibly
be
true,
which
is
if
you
have
a
strong
case
against
this
guy,
never
admit
this
other
thing.
that
couldn't
be
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
now
what
do
i
do
with
that
particularly?
because
the
other
side
has
said,
by
the
way,
this
is
that
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
trial
court's
findings...
i
read
them
the
way
justice
thomas
did.
