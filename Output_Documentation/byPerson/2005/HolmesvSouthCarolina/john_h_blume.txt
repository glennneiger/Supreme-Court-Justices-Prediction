mr.
john
h.
blume
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
in
this
case,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
took
the
second
of
two
recent
steps
that
dramatically
curtail
a
defendant's
ability
to
create
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
his
innocence
by
presenting
evidence
that
another
individual
committed
the
crime.
the
first
step
came
in
2001
when,
in
state
v.
gay,
the
court
held
that
the
admissibility
of
third
party
guilt
evidence
was
dependent
on
the
strength
of
the
prosecution's
case.
the
second
step,
which
occurred
in
mr.
holmes'
case,
holds
that
third
party
guilt
evidence
is
inadmissible
whenever
the
prosecution
has
presented
strong
forensic
evidence
of
the
defendant's
guilt.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
justice
scalia,
i
am.
it's
not
necessary
for
a
ruling
in
our
favor
in
this
case.
it's
not
contingent
here
because
at
a
minimum,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
rule
here
in
describing
it,
they
said
in
state
v.
gay
we
held
that
in
cases
where
there
is
strong
evidence
of
guilt,
including
strong
forensic
evidence,
evidence
that
a
third
party
committed
the
crime
is
not
admissible.
that
is
a
categorical
rule
of
exclusion
no
matter
how
you
cut
it.
but
even
if
you
deemed
that
there
is
some
discretion
left
in
the
system,
it
is
still
unconstitutional
because
what
the
south
carolina
system
requires
is
a
reasoning
backwards,
that
the
admissibility
of
evidence
of
the
defendant's
innocence
is
conditioned
on
the
judge's
assessment
of
the
likelihood
of
the
defendant's
guilt.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
that
it
is
possible
that
under
some
circumstances
not
the
strength
of
the
state's
case
but
the
evidence
as
a
whole
may
shed
some
light
on
whether
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
is
relevant.
for
example,
if
the
uncontested
evidence
is
the
crime
occurred
on
tuesday,
january
3rd,
and
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
shows
that
the
third
party
was
in
acapulco
on
january
3rd
and
had
no
possibility
to
be
there,
that's
not
a
strength
issue.
that
is
relevance.
but
when
the
touchstone
for
admissibility
is
whether
the
defense
evidence
overcomes
the
prosecution's
case...
and
in
the
south
carolina
rule
for...
just
to
be
clear,
it's
not
even
considered
that
you
consider
the
evidence
of
guilt.
the
defense
evidence
of
third
party
guilt
has
to
overcome
the
prosecution's
forensic
evidence.
mr.
john
h.
blume
if
the
south
carolina--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--just
to
make
sure
i
understand
it,
if
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
this
case
on
these
facts
had
said
this
was
a
403.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no.
i
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--under
this
court's
decision
in
olden
v.
kentucky
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
evidentiary
rulings,
based
on
the
strength
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
can
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
deprive
a
defendant
of--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--defense.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
that
ruling
in
this
case
would
be
unconstitutional
because
it
would
be
a
mischaracterization
of
what
mr.
holmes'
evidence
was.
mr.
john
h.
blume
challenging
the
dna
evidence.
that
is
not
the...
the
state
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
but--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--that
the
evidence
in
this
case...
that
even
the
fbi
agents
who
testified
for
the
government
admitted
the
dna
could
have
been
placed
through
the
incompetent
handling
of
the
evidence
by
officer
mobley,
that
without
gloves
and
with
all
the
evidence
in
his
possession,
he
inventoried
the
items,
including
mr.
holmes'
clothing
and
the
victim's
clothing,
stuck
his
hands
in
the
bag,
determined
what
was
in
there
without
washing
them
or
gloves,
stuck
his
hand
in
another
bag,
determined
what
was
in
there.
and
even
they
admitted
that
due
to
the
very
small
amount
of
dna
that
was
recovered,
that
officer
mobley's
actions
could
have
been
the
source
of
the
dna
on
the
clothing.
in
addition
to
that,
there
were
a
number
of
other
suspicious
activities,
including
officer
mobley
locked
everyone
else
out
before
he
inventoried,
processed
the
scene.
and
then
there
were
problems
with
contamination
there.
and
then
at
the
bottom...
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
defense
presented
a
dna
expert,
the
only
non
forensic
scientist,
but
the
most
qualified
scientist
in
the
case
from
the
new
york
university
medical
school,
and
he
said,
look,
this
dna
doesn't
mean
anything.
there
are
things
that
science
cannot
explain.
there
are
dye
globs
here
which
should
not
be
present.
there's
also
a
spike
that
does
not
belong
to
mr.
holmes
or--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it's...
it's
in
the
joint
appendix.
the...
the
agent
which
admitted
this
was
agent
baechtel.
i
think
it's
actually
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
249,
but
i'm
not
positive
of
that,
and
counsel
will
look
for
it.
but
there
was
also
their
defense
expert
who
said
that
the
bottom
line
results
were
unreliable.
so
at
the--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
find
that
surprising
at
all,
given
the
facts
of
this
case.
it's,
you
know,
seek
and
ye
shall
find,
or
don't
seek
and
ye
shall
not
find.
in
this
case,
they
took
none
of
jimmy
white's
clothing
to
test
to
see
if
there
was
any
incriminating
dna
on
that.
they
didn't
take
his
shoes,
even
though
they
had
the
shoe
print.
this
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
dna
pointed
to
a
single
perpetrator.
there
were
no
vaginal
swabs
or
rectal
swabs
which
contained
any
information
of
any
value
whatsoever.
and
by
the
time
they
finally
got
around
to
doing
the
dna
testing
in
1996,
numerous
items
of
clothing,
including
several
items
belonging
to
the
victim,
had
disappeared
and
no
one
could
explain
where
they
had
went.
so
the
fact
that
they
didn't
find
jimmy
white's
dna
on
bobby
holmes'
clothing
i
think
is
of
no
significance
whatsoever.
the
main...
one
of
the
main
thrusts
of
the
defense
case
here
was
because
of
the
incompetence
or
the
malfeasance
of
the
police
officers
in
this
case,
that
the
evidence
against
holmes
was
unreliable.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
i
would
say,
justice
scalia,
that
that's
the
way
the
49
other
states
do
it.
south
carolina
is
the
only
state
which
has
a
rule
which
requires
a
defendant
to
overcome
the
prosecution's
case.
and
in
south
carolina,
not
only
do
you
have
to
overcome
the
prosecution's
case,
the
only
thing
that
counts
is
the
prosecution's
evidence.
they
completely
dismiss--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--in
the
holmes
opinion.
mr.
john
h.
blume
the...
the
holding
in
mr.
holmes'
case
is
holmes
simply
cannot
overcome
the
forensic
evidence
against
him.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
there
has
not
been
a...
a
decision
since
then.
but
i
think
if
you
read
the
sentence
before
that
in
the
opinion
where
it
says...
they
describe
the
gregory
rule,
which
was
the
old
rule,
with
which
we
have
no
quarrel.
the
rules
are
similar
to
that
in
other
jurisdictions.
it
says,
further,
we
held
in
state
v.
gay
that
in
cases
where
there
is
strong
evidence
of
guilt,
especially
forensic
evidence,
evidence
of
third
party
guilt
simply
is
not
admissible.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
i...
i
think
because,
one,
if
you
do
that,
you
could
supplant...
you...
you
have
made
the
judge
the
jury,
and
the
defendant,
in
order
to
present
evidence
of
his
innocence,
have
to...
has
to
win
a
trial
before
the
trial...
before
the
judge.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i...
first
of
all,
there
is
no
other
state
that
does
it
that
way.
no
state
considers
that.
they
look
at
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
on
its
own
terms
and
consider
does
it
raise
a
reasonable
inference.
and
even
in
your
hypothetical,
the--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--403--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--there...
there
is,
and
i
think
the
south
carolina
rule
is
a
categorical
rule
based
on
the
description.
i
think
it
also
requires
a
defendant
to
overcome,
and
it
does
so
in
an
unfair
way.
footnote
8
in
the
opinion
makes
clear
that
in
establishing
whether
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
overcomes
the
state's
evidence,
you
look
only
at
the
state's
evidence,
and
the
defendant's
counter
forensic
evidence
is
deemed
irrelevant.
so
you
have
to
overcome
it
with
a
stacked
deck.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
that
you
cannot...
that
as
a
general
matter,
a
state
cannot
require
a
defendant
to
persuade
a
judge
of
his
likely
innocence
before
he
can
present
evidence
to
the
jury
that
he's
innocent.
that
is...
that
is
putting
the
judge
in
the
role
of
the
jury,
and
that's
what
the
south--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
it
depends
what
consideration
means.
consideration,
for
example,
in
terms
of
is
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
relevant
in
some
way,
that
is
not
constitutionally
objectionable.
but
when
you
have
a
weighing
procedure
like
south
carolina
does
and
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
of
innocence
depends
on
a
judge's
assessment
of
the
credibility
of
the
defendant's
case
and
the
prosecution's
case,
that
is
what
juries
do.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
that
would
be...
because
that
is
implicitly
weighed.
your
hypothetical
to
me
is
implicitly
weighed,
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
that's
unconstitutional.
all
these
cases
where
you
indicate,
well,
you
know,
what
if
it's
conclusively...
that
the
evidence
is
conclusive
and
the
defendant
didn't
contest
the
dna,
should
it
be
let
in--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--that...
well,
only
for
relevance
and
possibly
for
some
403's
because
that's
looking
at
the
403
part.
but
in
that--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
that
that
is
problematic.
and...
but
the...
the
point
i
think
is
no
other
state
does
it.
now,
they
would...
if
it
didn't
pass
the
laugh
test,
it
wouldn't
pass
the
laugh
test
on
its
own
terms.
if
you
read
the
cases
of
exclusion,
it's
where
the
defendant
wanted
to
present
evidence
that
some
dude
named
duke
that
nobody
can
find
had
a
motive
to
kill
the
person.
and
the
courts
say,
well,
no,
you
can't
do
that.
or
the...
someone
is
on
trial
and
they
want
to
prove
that
the...
for
killing
a
man's
wife,
and
they
want
to
show,
well,
the
husband
had
$1
million
in
life
insurance
policies.
and
courts
said,
no,
you
can't
do
that.
if
all
you've
got
is
motive,
if
all
you've
got
is
propensity,
if
all
you've
got
is
opportunity,
that's
not
in
this...
they're...
in
all
the
other
49
states,
they're
looking
at
it
on
their
own
terms.
nothing
this
court
will
do
in
mr.
holmes'
case
will
disturb
the
law
in
the
other
49
jurisdictions.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
but
you're
not
considering
how
strong
the
government's
case
is
and
conditioning
admissibility--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i'm
sorry.
i...
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that.
i
was
sort
of
just
describing
how
other
states
do
it
and
the
relevance.
then
they
also...
many
of
them
have...
they
articulate
it
different
ways,
but
it's
basically
relevance
with
a
403
type
of
exclusion,
that
if
the
evidence
doesn't
meet
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
on
its
own
terms,
doesn't
meet
a
certain
quantum,
back...
does
it
get
over
the
laugh
test,
then
it's
not
admissible.
other
states
do
it
and
they
say,
well,
it's
got
to
create
a
reasonable
inference
of
innocence.
that's
fine.
or
it
must
create
a
reasonable
likelihood
about
the
defendant's
guilt.
that's
fine
too.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
well,
i
do
for
the
following
reason.
the...
that
case
may
make
it
an
easy
call,
but
it's
still
the
jury's
call,
just
for
the
same
reason
that
a
judge
couldn't,
in
a
very
strong
case
like
that,
say,
i'm
not
allowing
the
defendant's
alibi
witnesses
to
testify.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
chief
justice
roberts,
i
submit
that
that
is,
one,
not
correct
factually.
i
mean,
i
think
if
anything,
it's
more
like--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
it's
not...
it's
certainly
not
true
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
even
as
a
general
proposition,
i
think
defendants
are
more
likely
to
get
alibi
witnesses
to
lie
for
them
than
other
people.
but
we
still
allow
the
jury,
the
ultimate
lie
detector,
to
make
that
decision.
and
if
you
read
the
hundreds
of
criminal
appeals
that
come
out
each
year,
this
is
not
a
big
problem.
it
doesn't
come
up
a
lot,
and
the
law
in
the
49
other
jurisdictions
seems
to
handle
it.
south
carolina
is
the
state--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
if
you
go
through
the
cases,
even
in
the
amicus
brief,
filed
by
the
state
of
kansas,
they
were
able
to
come
up
with
two
decisions
one,
an
unreported
decision
from
the
d.c.
circuit;
and
the
other,
an
intermediate
decision
by
the
california
court
of
appeal,
which
took
into
account
the
strength
of
the
state's
case.
if
you
read
all
the
other
cases
from
all
the
other
states
or
you
read
the
articulation
of
the
rules,
it
doesn't
do
that.
so
a
judgment
in
mr.
holmes'
favor
will
leave
the
law
of
those
states
intact.
but
even
if--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
it's...
it's
not--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--that's
not
the
way
the
decisions,
if
you
read
them
and
read
the
evidence,
that
they
work.
but
it's...
i
mean,
it...
it
does...
if
the
judge
weighs
and
conditions
the
admissibility
of
evidence
of
innocence
on
the
ability
to
overcome...
and
that's
the
south
carolina
rule,
overcome
the
prosecution's
case
and
overcome
it
with
a
stacked
deck
where
any
of
the
defendant's
counter
evidence
is
irrelevant,
it's
impossible.
a
defendant
could
never
overcome
it.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
you
don't
have
to...
you
can't
consider
it
the
way
south
carolina
is.
but
i
think
it
would
have
the...
the
place...
the
strength
of
the
government's
case
has
some
bearing.
or
the
government's
case
may
have
some
bearing...
not
the
strength
of
it...
on
whether
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
is
relevant
to
some,
you
know,
issue
in
the
trial.
but
it
also
would
have
some
significance
on
the
back
end
if
a
judge
excluded
it
in
determining
whether
any
error
was
harmless
or
not.
and
that's
traditionally
the
place
on
appeal
where
you
consider
the
strength
of
the
government's
case.
there's
no
other
category
of
evidence
in
our
system
where
we
take
into
account
the
overall
strength
of
the
case
to
admit
it.
if
that
were
true,
then
why
don't
we
allow
judges
to
direct
verdicts?
why
don't
we
allow
judges
to
exclude
a
defendant's
testimony?
look,
the
government's
evidence
is
strong.
the
dna
evidence
here
is
overwhelming.
anything
this
defendant
says,
when
he
gets
up
there,
is
going
to
be
a
lie.
i'm
not
allowing
it.
we
don't
do
that.
juries
in
our
system
make
credibility
determinations
and
that's
what
the
rule,
which
requires
you
to...
where
you
have
to
weigh
the
defendant's
evidence
against
the
government's
evidence,
usurps
the
function
of
the
jury.
finally,
in
this
case
the...
there
is
a
contention
that
the
error
was
harmless,
and
i
wanted
to
briefly
respond
to
that.
now...
and
then
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
save
the
remainder
of...
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
but
there
are
three
principal
reasons
the
error
in
this
case
was
harmless.
first...
and
part
of
this
i've
already
discussed
with
justice--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i'm
sorry.
was
not
harmless.
and
the
first
one
i've
discussed
with
justice
breyer
in
response
to
your
questions
previously,
that
i
think
any
fair
review
of
the
record
here
is
that
the
forensic
evidence
was
a
jump
ball.
now...
and
while
we
do
not
contest
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
convict,
it
certainly
was
not
overwhelming
and
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
entertained
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
mr.
holmes'
guilt
based
solely
on
the
evidence
at
trial.
mr.
john
h.
blume
there
wasn't
even...
yes,
there
was
some
evidence
that
he
was
within
a
mile--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--or
so
at
the
time.
there
was
much
stronger
evidence
that
mr.
white
was
in
the
area
where
the
crime
occurred,
near
where
the
crime
occurred.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
they
found
him
guilty
based
on
it,
yes.
but,
of
course,
that
can't
be
the
touchstone
of
whether
the
error
was
prejudicial.
the
state
has
the
burden
of
demonstrating
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
exclusion
of
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
could
not
have
contributed
to
the
verdict.
in
this
case,
the
forensic
evidence
was,
i
submit,
a
jump
ball.
the
defense
had--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--the
court
is
right,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
citing
one
expert's
opinion.
it
is
wrong
in
that
it
ignores
that
even
that
agent
admitted
that
the
dna
could
have
been
produced
through
the
contamination
of
officer
mobley,
through
his...
through
the
bags.
so
that
could
explain
the
results.
and
it
also
ignores
the
fact...
the
footnote
does...
that
a
defense
expert,
dr.
peter
d'eustachio
said
that
that's
not
a
fair
and
accurate
representation.
in
my
opinion,
in
my
expert
opinion,
there...
you
cannot
do
any
dna
calculations
on
this.
these
charts
are
completely
unreliable.
so
that's
all
it
is,
and
it's...
it
has,
i
think,
no
significance
here
in
light
of
the
evidence
as
a
whole.
it's
a
factually
inaccurate
statement
of
the
record
as
a
whole.
but
in
addition
to
the
evidence,
the
most...
a
very
significant
factor
in
determining
whether
this
error
was
harmless
or
not
is
having
succeeded
in
convincing
the
trial
judge
to
exclude
the
evidence,
the
prosecutor
in
his
closing
argument
said,
look,
they've
indicated
that
this
evidence
was
planted.
they've
indicated
this
evidence
was
contaminated.
if
bobby
holmes
didn't
do
it,
who
is...
where
is
the
raping,
murdering
thing
that
did?
so
he
took
complete
and
unfair
advantage
of
the
absence
of
evidence
in
the
trial
court's
ruling
in
securing
the
conviction
here.
and
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
other
occasions,
in
satterwhite
and
clemons,
that
a
prosecutor's
argument
is
an
important
factor
in
determining
whether
error
was
harmless.
and
finally--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--you
did
not.
i
mean,
we
do
believe
it
was
an
independent
constitutional
error,
but
even
apart
from
that,
it's
still
a
factor
in
gauging
harmlessness.
this
court
has
said
that
on
a
number
of
occasions,
that
what
is
in
the
argument
is
a
factor
in
harmless
error.
and
then
finally,
excluding...
not
allowing
the
evidence
deprived
mr.
holmes
of
presenting
an
alternative
counter
theory.
you
can
see
a
jury
saying,
well,
you
know,
we've
heard
all
this.
this
is
a
bunch
of
contesting
evidence,
but
almost
asking
the
questions
the
prosecutor
did,
which
certainly
they
would
have
asked
after
it
was,
well,
you're
right.
we
didn't
hear
any
evidence
of
that.
bobby
holmes
had
a
powerful
counter
story.
he
should
have
been
allowed
to
tell
it.
the
south
carolina
rule
is
unconstitutional.
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
john
h.
blume
may
it
please
the
court--
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
found,
if
you
want
to
go...
he
found
there
was
sufficient
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
find
that
jimmy
white
was
in
the
area
at
the
time.
the
trial
judge...
that's
on
joint
appendix
page
134.
on
135,
he
also
found
there
was
sufficient
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
believe
that
jimmy
white
confessed
to
being
the
perpetrator,
and
there
was
sufficient
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
conclude
that
jimmy
white
had
in
the
past
committed
acts
against
women.
and
then
he
made
the
mistake
of
fact
and
a
mistake
of
law.
he
treated
white
as
unavailable
and
therefore
he
excluded
the
statement
made.
that
was
wrong.
white
was
available.
under
south
carolina
law,
he
should
have
been
able
to
have
been
called.
he
could
have
been
impeached,
and
the
prior...
these
statements
would
come
in
as
substantive
evidence.
it
was
also
wrong,
even
as
the
statement
gets
penal
interest.
the
only
corroboration
is
was
the
statement
made,
not
is
it
true.
that's
the...
and
in
that
case,
he
found
the
statements
were
made.
and
that's
why
the
state
supreme
court
did
not
embrace
or
rely
upon
what
the
trial
court
did
because
it
was
clearly
wrong.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no.
i...
i
think
it
might
be
harmless
at
that
point.
any
error
ensuing
might
be
harmless.
but
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
inferentially
and
directly
says,
you
know,
this
dna
isn't
all
it's
cracked
up
to
be.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no.
i
just
think
it
might
be
that
it
was
then...
the
error
might
not
have
been
prejudicial
in
the
context
of
the
record
as
a
whole.
but
a
jury
could
still,
looking
at
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
say,
well,
you
know,
this
dna
isn't
all
it's
cracked
up
to
be.
there's
nothing
sacrosanct
about
dna
or
forensic
evidence.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--and
the
jury
might
be
absolutely
right
about
that,
and
it's
their
determination
to
make.
it
might
be
that
they
don't
challenge
the
dna
evidence
because
the
trial
judge
didn't
give
them
funds
to
do
it.
in
this
case
they
did
it
because
a
washington,
d.c.
law
firm
essentially
was
able
to
provide
funds
for
them
to
really
look
at
and
challenge
the
inadequacies
in
this
evidence.
it's
that...
the
problem
is
that
even
if
you
don't
read
the
opinion
like
we
do...
and
we
think
it's
the
only
fair
reading...
there's
no
question
that
the
south
carolina
rule
requires
you
to
overcome
it
and
it
stacks
the
deck.
thank
you.
