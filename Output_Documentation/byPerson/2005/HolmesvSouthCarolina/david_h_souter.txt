justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
with
respect,
i...
isn't
the...
the
term
that
they
use...
and
i
was
going
to
ask
essentially
the
same
question.
the
term
that
the
court
uses
is
raise
a
reasonable
inference
of
his
innocence.
and
i
will...
i
will
grant
you
this.
when
i
read
that,
it
said...
i
thought
to
myself
it
sounds
as
though
they
are
saying
he
must
present
evidence
or
make
a
showing,
a
preliminary
showing,
that
it
is
more
probable
than
not
that
he
is
innocent
despite
the
state's
evidence.
but
they
never
spell
that
out,
and
is
it
spelled
out
anywhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the...
what
if
the
court
says,
we
will
weigh
it
to
the
extent
of
determining
whether,
in
light
of
the
state's
case,
the
proffered
evidence,
if
accepted,
would
pass
the
laugh
test?
that's
weighing.
is...
is
that...
is
that
legitimate?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
does
go...
somehow
that
goes
beyond
mere
relevance.
you
can't
say
that
the...
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
the
existence
of
the
million
dollars
in
life
insurance
is
irrelevant.
it's
just
that
it
doesn't
prove
much
unless
it
can
be
combined
with
certain
other
kinds
of
evidence.
and
when
you
say
you've
got
a
standard
that
looks
into
that,
then
you
have
crossed
the
line
from
mere
relevance
to
probative
force,
haven't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i...
i
grant
you
that.
but
to
say
that
the
only
test
is
relevance
seems
to
be
too
strong.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
zelenka,
do
you...
do
you
agree
with
the
characterization
that
your
brother
has
given,
largely
by
way
of
quotation
from
the
opinion
in
this
case,
that
the
rule
of
admissibility
that...
that
the...
that
the
court
followed
in...
or
that
the
supreme
court
approved
in
this
case
would
have
required
the
defendant
to
show
to
a
degree
of
probability,
in
light
of
all
the
evidence,
including
the
forensic
evidence,
that
he
was
innocent
as
a
condition
of...
of
admitting
the
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
well,
what
do
you...
i
mean,
your...
your
brother's
strongest
point
is
this
statement,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
365
of
the
joint
appendix
where
the...
where
the
opinion
is
set
out,
at...
at
the
top
of
the
page,
the
second
sentence.
he
simply
cannot
overcome
the
forensic
evidence
against
him
to
raise
a
reasonable
inference
of
his
own
innocence.
what
could
that
mean
other
than
a
probability
that
he
is
innocent
in
light
of
all
the
evidence,
including
the
forensic
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
what
does
it
mean?
i
mean,
i've
given
you
a
suggestion
as
to
what
it
seems
to
mean
on
a
straightforward
reading,
and...
and
i
take
it
you
disagree
with
that.
but
can
you
explain
how
it
could
mean
something
else?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's...
it's
true.
when
they...
on
the...
on
the
previous
page,
the
bottom
of
364,
they...
they
cite...
they
first
quote
gregory
and
then
they
cite
gay
and
they
characterize,
i
guess,
the
two
together
as...
well,
they
say,
in
gay,
we
held
that
where
there
is
strong
evidence
of
an
appellant's
guilt,
especially
where
there
is
strong
forensic
evidence,
the
proffered
evidence
about
a
third
party's
guilt
does
not
raise
a
reasonable
inference
as
to
the
appellant's
own
innocence.
it
doesn't
use
the
word
overcome
which
it
uses
on
the
other
page.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
without
the
word
overcome,
what...
what
can
reasonable
inference
of
innocence
mean,
considered
in
light
of
the
other
evidence
in
the
case,
if
it
doesn't
mean
something
like
a
probability
of...
of
innocence?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
trial
judge
also
kept
it
out,
didn't
he,
because
he
believed
there
was...
there
was
no
penal
interest
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
then
you
get
to
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
then
you
get
to
the...
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
and
they
don't
keep
it
out
on...
on
grounds
of...
of
threshold
reliability.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
and
i...
i
take
it
what
you
will
do,
in
the
course
of
your
second
point,
is
tell
us
the
answer
to
this
question,
that
if
we
do
not
accept
the
overcome
by
reasonable
inference
formulation
that
is
here,
what
would
be
an
acceptable
formulation
because
i
think
that's
what
you...
you
say
you're
getting
to.
but
that
would
be
very
helpful
to
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
one
of
the
problems
is
i
don't
know
what
it
requires.
on...
on
the...
on
the
second
page
of
the
opinion
that
i
quoted,
it
is
used
with
the
word
overcome,
which
certainly
suggests
that
it
is
supposed
to
raise
a
probability
of
innocence
in
light
of
all
the
evidence.
sometimes
it
is
used
without
overcome,
as
it
was
earlier
in
the
opinion.
i
don't
know
what
they
mean
by
inference.
do
they
mean
evidence
from
which
one
might
reasonably
conclude,
from
which
one...
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
concluding?
i
just
don't
know
what
the
terms
mean.
so
i
hope
you'll
give
us
a
suggested
formulation
with...
with
terms
that...
that
are
defined
that...
that
you
and
the
states
that
you
represent
would...
would
think
was
an
acceptable
and
constitutional
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
included
several.
which...
which
one--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
