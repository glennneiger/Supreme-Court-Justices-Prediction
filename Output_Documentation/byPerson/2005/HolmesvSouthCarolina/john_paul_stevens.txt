justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing...
i've
written
a
fair
number
of
opinions
involving
criminal
cases
where
i've
had
to
say
that
we
take
all
the
inferences
favorable
to
the
prosecution,
and
based
on
that
rule,
we
find
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
the
jury's
verdict.
how
we
would
have
decided
it
is
not
before
us.
we
accept
the
jury's
verdict.
what
if
the...
on
the
merits
of
the
underlying
crimes,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
had
written
that
kind
of
an
opinion
rather
than
there's
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt?
do
you
think
they
would
have
held
the
third
party
evidence
admissible
or
inadmissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
odd
that
they
didn't
say
that.
their...
the
reasons
they
gave
were
that
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
overwhelming.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
he
did,
he
would
be
making
a
credibility
determination,
wouldn't
he?
he
would
be
deciding
an
issue
that
normally
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
example
that
justice
kennedy
gave
you
was
such
a
determination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
surely,
you're
not
arguing
the
third
party
evidence
can
only
come
in
if
it's
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
you're
not
arguing
that
standard,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
did
say
it
wouldn't
be
enough
to
convict.
