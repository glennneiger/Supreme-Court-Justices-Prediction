justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
suppose
that
in
a
purely
discretionary
system...
i...
i
can't
quite
think
of
the
hypothetical...
the
strength
of
the
prosecution's
case
may
bear
on
the
assessment
of
relevance
and
materiality
as
to
the
evidence
the
defense
wants
to
introduce.
if...
if
the
evidence
of
identification
is...
is
quite
clear...
is
quite
clear...
and
then
there's
some
witness
of
marginal
credibility
that
says
he
was
in
another
city,
i
think
that
may
affect
the
trial
court's
balance.
i...
i
take
the
thrust
of
your
point,
that
the
strength
of
the
case
makes
it
more
important
to
introduce
the
third
party
evidence,
not...
not
less.
i...
i
take
that
point.
but
just
as...
as
an
absolute
rule,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
strength
of
the
case
is
always
irrelevant.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm...
i'm
just
not
sure
that's
the
case.
we're
asking
about
403.
in
order
to
completely
exclude
and
prescind,
in
justice
scalia's
word,
that
the...
the
nature
of
the
prosecution's
case
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now...
now,
if
you
want
to
say
there's
a
more
wooden
rule
and
a...
and
a
more
iron
rule
here
that
was
prejudicial,
i
think
that's
something
else.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
guess
my...
my
point...
maybe
it's
some
of
my
colleagues'
point...
is
that
really
the
strength
of
the
government's
case
is
subsumed
within
the
general
calculus
of
whether
or
not
this
would
cause
a
delay
of...
of
time,
whether
it
would
get
into
extraneous
issues,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
way
of
phrasing
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
quite
apart
from
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statement
is
questionable
as
an
empirical
matter.
why
is
it
that
forensic
evidence
somehow
should
be
used
to
exclude
third
party
guilt
evidence
as...
as
a
universal
proposition?
maybe
in
some
cases
yes,
maybe
in
some...
but
this
is
a
universal
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
i
were
the
trial
court,
in
a
subsequent
case
in
south
carolina,
i
would...
i
would
have
to
read
this
instruction
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
as
saying
i
simply
could
not
admit
this
evidence
when
there's
forensic
evidence.
and
that's
a
very
strange
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
had
been
evidence
that
the
time
of
death
testimony
had
been
contrived,
planted,
fabricated.
then
what?
or
suppose
that
was
the
allegation
of
the
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
is
a
dispute
here
as
to
the
forensic
evidence.
the
suggestion
is
it's
planted.
