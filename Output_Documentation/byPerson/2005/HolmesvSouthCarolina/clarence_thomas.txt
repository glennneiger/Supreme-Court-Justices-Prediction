justice
clarence
thomas
counsel,
before
you
change
subjects,
isn't
it
more
accurate
that
the
trial
court
actually
found
that
the
evidence
met
the
gregory
standard?
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
he
says--
justice
clarence
thomas
--well,
he
says
at
first
blush,
the
above
arguably
rises
to
the
gregory
standard.
however,
the
engine
that
drives
the
train
in
this
gregory
analysis
is
the
confession
by
jimmy
mccaw
white.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that
that,
of
course,
can't
be
introduced
because
it's
hearsay.
so
it...
it
seems
as
though
he
says
that
if
it
is
to
be
believed
what
jimmy
white
says,
it
meets
the
gregory
standard.
so
i
don't
quite
understand
where
gay,
which
is
subsequent
to...
to
this
case...
where
gay
comes
in
because
it
didn't
seem
to
be
the
standard
that
the
trial
court
applied.
