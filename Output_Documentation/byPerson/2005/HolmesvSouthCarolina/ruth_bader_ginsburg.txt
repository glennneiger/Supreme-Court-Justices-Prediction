what
about...
what
about
the
dna...
the
exclusion
of
the
alleged
perpetrator,
of
white?
there...
there
was
no
trace
of
white's
dna.
and
that
was
an
fbi
officer
who
testified
to
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
question
on
which
we
didn't
grant
cert.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
use--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--could...
could
you
use
the
same
rule
with
respect
to
alibi
evidence?
this
trial
judge
would
say
this
evidence
for
the
prosecution
is
so
strong,
i'm
not
going
to
let
any
alibi
evidence
in.
is
there...
is
there
anything
special
about
third
party
guilt?
couldn't...
couldn't
you
use...
use
it
for
other
defenses?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we...
can
we
just
back
up
to
cabrera?
the
d.c.
circuit
did
not
publish
that
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
unless
the
rule
has
changed,
it
didn't
have...
it
didn't
have
any
precedential
effect...
those
opinions
that
they
did
not
put
in
the
federal
reports.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
that,
could
a
prosecutor
have
gotten
this
case...
gotten
an
indictment
against
white
on
the
basis
that
he
had
four
witnesses
who
put
him
in
the
proximity
of
the
crime,
four
who
said
that
they
heard
him
confess?
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence,
could
white
have
been
indicted
for
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
also
throw
in
one
more
thing,
the
victim's
description
of
the
assailant.
so
if...
if
white
could
have
been
indicted
for
this
crime
and...
and
yet
the
jury
is
not
allowed
to
hear
that
evidence,
that
sounds
passing
strange
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
said
it
was
enough
to
indict
and
that
very
same
evidence
is
put
before
the
jury,
but
it
wouldn't
be
enough
to
convict?
