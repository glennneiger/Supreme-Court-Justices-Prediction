justice
antonin
scalia
now,
there's
some
dispute
as
to
whether
that...
that
is
really
what...
what
it
held.
and
there's
a
big
difference.
if...
if
you
just
say
whenever
you...
whenever
the
prosecution
has
a
strong
case,
you
can't
introduce
other
guilt,
or
whether
all
that
the
court
is
saying
is
that
one
of
the
elements
that
you
consider
in
determining
whether
to
admit
this...
this
third
party
is
not
just...
it's
the
comparative
weakness
of
the
third
party
case.
you
don't
blind
yourself
to...
to
the
strength
of
the
prosecution's
case.
will
you
say
it
was
bad
even
if
it
was
the
latter
that
the
court
was...
was
referring
to?
are
you
saying
you
cannot
consider
the
strength
of
the
prosecution's
case
at
all
in
determining
whether
to
allow
in
third
party
guilt
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
blume,
i...
i
know
you're
more
concerned
about...
about
what
result
you
get
in
this
case
and...
and
whether
your
client
gets
another
trial
or
not.
i
am
more
concerned
about...
about
the
rule
of
law
that
we're
going
to
apply
in
the
case
which
will
affect
a
whole
lot
of
other
trials,
and
i...
i
frankly
think
we're
playing
with
fire.
i...
i
worry
about
criminal
trials
turning
into
circuses
in
which...
in...
in
which
the
police
are
put
on
trial,
which
is
part
of
what
is
happening
here
and
what
has
happened
in...
in
a
famous
recent
american
case.
i
worry
that...
that
that
will
be
the...
the
result
if...
if
we
take
your
suggestion,
which
is
to
prescind
from
any
consideration
of
the
strength
of
the
prosecution's
case
and
simply
look
at
the...
at
the
alleged
third
party
guilt
evidence
on
its
own
without...
without
any
consideration
of
its
relative...
its
relative
strength.
just...
you
want
us
to
do
it
just
absolutely.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think...
you
think
there's
no
difference
where
really
very
questionable
evidence
about
some
third
party's
guilt
is...
is
produced
in
a
case
where...
where
the
state's
case
barely
makes
it
over
the...
over
the
line
to
get
to
the
jury
and
you
think
it's...
it's
the
same
call
where
that
barely
questionable
third
party
evidence
is...
is
put
in
in
opposition
to
a
state's
case
that
is...
is
watertight...
i
mean,
you
know,
forensic
evidence,
all
sorts
of
proof.
you...
you
think
the
two
have
to
be
treated
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
other
side
agree
with
that?
i...
i'd
be
surprised
if
that
were
the
law
in
the
other
49
jurisdictions,
that
the
judges
just
blind
themselves
to
the...
to
the
prosecution's
case
when
they
make
these
calls.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
authority
for...
for
the...
for
opposition
that
every
other
jurisdiction
does
it
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
arguing
about
that.
i...
i
don't
think
anybody
has
asked
you
that
question.
the
question
is
whether
you
can
consider
it
at
all,
and...
and
you
say
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
not
harmless
you
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
what
the
court
said,
though.
the
court
didn't...
did...
whatever
the
court
said,
it
clearly
did
not
say
just
looking
at
the
third
party
guilt
evidence
by
itself,
it's
not...
it's
not
trustworthy.
whatever
else
it
said,
it
didn't
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
yes.
now,
you
say
that's
true.
now,
it
may
well
have
been
true,
but
that...
we're...
we're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
as
i
recall,
the
trial
court
did
say
that
this
was
pretty
persuasive
evidence
but
for
the
fact
that
you
had
to
exclude
some
of
it
because
that
there
was
no
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
didn't
he
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
said
more
than
that.
i
think
he
said
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
friend
will
tell
us
what
he
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
zelenka,
do
you
agree
that
all
49
other
states
do
not
look
at
the...
at
the
weight
of
the
prosecution's
case
when
making
this
decision?
justice
antonin
scalia
excluding
the
confession.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
anybody
else
looked
at
the
evidence
on
both
sides?
justice
antonin
scalia
other
states
i
mean.
other
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wasn't
it
in
the
baby
shaking
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
there
no
credibility
determination
made
in
the
baby
shaking
case
you
just
described?
didn't...
didn't
you
have
to
conclude
that
the
evidence
concerning
the
time
of
death
was...
was
credible,
was
accurate?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
johnson,
your...
your
citation
of
the...
of
the
portion
of
the...
of
the
trial
court
opinion,
which
says
that
there
was
no
corroboration
of
the...
of
the
confession,
that
was
not
stated
to...
to
say,
and
therefore,
the
confessions
were
weak
evidence.
that
point
was
made
in
order
to
say,
therefore,
the
confession
cannot
be
admitted
because
the...
the
rule
was
it's
hearsay,
but
hearsay
that's
corroborated
can
be
admitted.
so
i
think
you're
misdescribing
the--
