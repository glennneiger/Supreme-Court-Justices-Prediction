do
you
have
any
idea
how
often
this...
this
sort
of
situation
comes
up
where
there's
an
alleged
violation
of
the
act
and
then
a
denial
by
the
district
court
of
a
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
mean--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
the
judge,
when
he
finally
found
the
defendant
competent,
had
said
expressly,
and
i...
i
made
this
determination
in
my
mind
shortly
after
the
hearing
and
the...
the
briefs
that
were
submitted
at
that
time,
but
now
i'm
putting
it
on
the
record,
that
wouldn't
be
sufficient?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
does
the
act
say
that,
that
there
has
to
be
a
finding
at
the
time?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
but
there's
no
provision,
is
there,
that
says
that
the
finding
under
(b)(4),
that
there
has
to
even
be
a
finding
under
(b)(4),
much
less
when
the
finding
has
to
be
made?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit,
and
it
concerns
the
operation
of
the
speedy
trial
act
of
1974.
the
act
generally
requires
a
federal
criminal
trial
to
begin
within
70
days
after
a
defendant
is
charged
or
makes
an
initial
appearance;
but
the
act
recognizes
that
there
are
various
reasons
for
greater
delay
in
particular
cases,
and
it
provides
a
detailed
list
of
specific
circumstances
where
delay
is
not
counted
towards
the
70-day
speedy-trial
clock.
if
the
clock
runs
out
and
the
defendant
moves
before
trial
begins
and
before
entering
a
guilty
plea,
the
district
court
must
dismiss
the
charges,
though
it
may
do
so
with
or
without
prejudice.
the
petitioner
here,
jacob
zedner,
was
indicted
for
his
attempts
to
open
accounts
using
counterfeit
united
states
bonds.
initially,
the
district
court
granted
two
so-called
ends-of-justice
continuances.
the
act
provides
that
delay
may
be
excluded
from
the
speedy
trial
act
if
the
ends
of
justice
outweigh
the
defendant’s
and
the
public’s
interest
in
a
speedy
trial;
but
the
act
requires
the
judge
to
make
on-the-record
findings
to
that
effect.
when
petitioner
asked
for
a
third
continuance,
the
district
court
started
to
worry
about
scheduling;
so
the
district
court
asked
petitioner
to
simply
waive
the
application
of
the
act
for
all
time,
and
the
district
court
produced
a
preprinted
form
for
him
to
sign;
petitioner
agreed.
at
the
next
status
conference
in
january
of
1997,
petitioner
asked
for
another
continuance.
the
court
granted
it,
but
didn’t
say
anything
about
the
speedy
trial
act.
that
continuance
lasted
91
days,
until
petitioner
came
back
to
court
in
may
of
1997.
a
few
years
later,
petitioner
argued
that
the
91-day
continuance
in
1997
was
not
excludable
from
the
speedy-trial
clock,
so
the
case
should
be
dismissed.
the
district
court
disagreed,
and
the
case
went
to
trial,
where
petitioner
was
convicted.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
91-day
delay
was
excludable
under
the
act.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
conclude
that
it
was
not
excludable;
so
we
reverse
the
2nd
circuit.
the
case
must
be
dismissed,
though
it
will
up
to
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance
to
decide
whether
dismissal
should
be
with
or
without
prejudice.
first,
we
think
that
prospective
waivers
of
the
act
like
the
one
here
are
completely
at
odds
with
the
structure
and
the
purpose
of
the
act.
the
act
lays
out
in
great
detail
many
categories
of
excludable
delay;
but
waiver
by
the
defendant
is
not
among
them,
and
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
protect
not
just
the
defendant’s
interest
in
a
speedy
trial,
but
to
protect
the
public’s
interest,
as
well,
because
the
public
has
an
interest
in
the
prompt
administration
of
criminal
justice,
an
interest
that
busy
courts’
prosecutors
and
defense
counsel
may
not
always
attend
to.
allowing
a
defendant
to
opt
out
of
the
act
would
prevent
the
act
from
serving
the
public’s
interest,
so
petitioner’s
waiver
was
ineffective.
the
government
has
other
arguments
for
why
the
delay
was
excludable,
but
none
of
them
persuades
us.
the
government
invokes
the
doctrine
of
judicial
estoppel,
which
generally
prevents
a
party
from
gaining
an
unfair
benefit
by
changing
its
position
on
an
issue
during
the
course
of
litigation.
we
will
not
apply
that
doctrine
under
the
circumstances
here,
principally
because
it
would
swallow
up
the
act’s
no-waiver
policy.
the
government
also
suggests
that
the
91
days
in
question
could
have
been
excluded
under
an
ends-of-justice
continuance.
the
trouble
with
that
argument
is
that
the
act
explicitly
says
that
no
period
of
delay
resulting
from
an
ends-of-justice
continuance
is
excludable
unless
the
court
sets
forth
on
the
record
its
reasons
for
making
its
findings.
at
the
very
least,
that
finding
has
to
be
on
the
record
by
the
time
the
court
rules
on
a
defendant’s
motion
to
dismiss.
that
was
not
the
case
here.
nor
can
that
failure
be
regarded
as
harmless.
the
act’s
provisions
regarding
this
are
detailed,
procedurally
strict
and
unambiguous.
regarding
failure
to
comply
with
the
act
in
this
way
is
harmless
would
undermine
the
system
congress
has
set
up.
the
decision
is
unanimous
except
that
justice
scalia
does
not
join
part
3(a)(2)
and
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
in
the
judgment.
