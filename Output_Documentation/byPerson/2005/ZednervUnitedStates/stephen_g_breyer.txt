justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
on...
on
that
one,
the...
the
second
circuit
said
that
he
was
incompetent,
and
you
could
have
excluded
the
time
on
(4)
because
(4)
allows
you
to
exclude
time
when
he's
incompetent.
and
if,
in
fact,
the
district
judge
is
sitting
there
thinking
he's
incompetent,
then
the
failure
is
simply
a
failure
to
write
down
his
reason
why
it's
excluded.
i
guess
there's
uncertainty
here
as
to
what
the
reason
was
the
district
judge
excluded
that
time,
and
it's
a
little
bit
hypothetical
for
the
reason
that
justice
ginsburg
mentioned.
but
if
you
were
to
lose
on
the
first
point,
then
i
guess
on
this
point,
the
thing
to
do
would
be
to
send
it
back
and
determine
whether,
in
fact,
the
judge
intended
to
exclude
on
the
ground
of
competency,
in
which
case
his
failure
was
simply
a
failure
to
note
down
his
reason,
which
is
not
required
by
the
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
my
act
must
read
differently.
my
act
says
in
(4),
any
period
of
delay
resulting
from
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
mentally
incompetent.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
30
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
why,
see,
i
guess
on
this
point,
we'd
have
to
send
it
back
because
if,
in
fact,
the
judge
had
determined
in
his
mind
within
the
30-day
period
that
the
person
was
incompetent
or
he
was
incompetent
in
fact,
then
that
could
have
been
his
reason.
i'm
not
sure
what
to
do
about
this
point
in
any
case,
and
i
understand
that
you
think
he
wasn't
incompetent,
or
at
least
it
hadn't
been
so
found.
the
second
circuit
seemed
to
think
he
was
incompetent
because
that
was
their
basis.
so
i
guess
if
he
was,
it's
excluded,
and
if
he
wasn't,
it
isn't
excluded.
and
i
don't
know.
the
second
circuit
said
he
was.
so
maybe
you
should
have
another
chance
to
argue
this
before
the
second
circuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
view
is
that
we
should
say
that
the
second
circuit's
statement
that
the
defendant
could
not
have
been
tried
because,
at
that
time,
he
was
incompetent,
that
we
should
simply
say
that's
false,
that
the
second
circuit
is
wrong
to
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
know
how...
how
do
we
know
that
the
judge
didn't
set
forth
orally
his
reasons
for
finding
that
the
ends
of
justice
outweigh
the
interest,
et
cetera?
is
that
in
the
record
what
he
actually
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
i
don't
know
that
you'd
have
to
use
the
exact
words,
the
ends
of
justice
served.
you
know,
you
don't
have
to...
i'd
like
to
read
what
he
actually
said,
and
where...
where
is
that?
it's
not
on
page
192,
which
is
somebody's
opinion.
but
rather,
if
i
want
to
read
the
words,
where
do
i
look?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
you
could
say
then
that
it's
the
government
that
has
the
right.
it's
the
government
that
has
the
right,
and
the
government
should
have
objected.
i
mean,
the
problem,
of
course,
is
obvious,
that
it's
a
little
hard
on
the
district
judges
that
people
come
in
and
both
sides
tell
them
what
you
have
to
have
here
is
a
waiver.
are
you
sure
you
won't
raise
this
against
me
later?
i'm
positive.
i
swear.
you
mean
you
absolutely
swear
a
thousand
times
that
no
matter
what
i
do
and
have
delay,
you
will
never
raise
this
as
an
error
and
it's
fine?
yes.
okay?
so
he
says,
okay,
fine,
done.
you
win.
then
he
raises
it
as
an
error.
that's
rather...
called
sandbagging
the
judge.
and
obviously,
one
would
look
to...
or
i
would
look
to
ways
to
avoid
that,
but
you're
telling
me
i
can't
avoid
it,
and
that's
what
congress
wanted
and
so
be
it.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
it
not
correct?
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
here.
i'm
saying
that
in
your...
if
i
adopt
your
position
in
this
case,
i
would
have
to
have
the
same
position,
i
would
think,
in
the
most
egregious
cases.
wouldn't
i?
because
the
only
reason
i'd
adopt
it
here
is
because
congress
wanted
it
no
matter
what.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
you're...
then
am
i
right
in
characterizing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe.
i
mean,
judges
are
very
busy.
not
all
the
prosecutors
get
the
word.
it's
very
hard
to
ask
district
judges
to
raise
something
on
their
own
in
the
face
of
lawyers
who
are
telling
them
the
opposite.
so
you
say,
oh,
they'll
all
know.
i've
noticed
there
are
a
lot
of
opinions
we
write
that
they
don't
know
about--
[laughter]
--until,
say,
the
lawyers
point
them
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
pretty
hard
to
read
those
pages
as
if
they
were
anything
other
than
what
they
seemed
to
be
on
their
face,
that
he
didn't
worry
about
the
speedy
trial
act
because
he
thought
that
it
had
been
waived.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
that,
that
the...
if
you
agree
that
the
defendant
can't
waive
it,
well,
the
reason
that
he
got
the
continuance
is
because
he
waived
it,
otherwise
there
would
have
been
something
else
done
and...
or
at
least
might
have
been.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
ask
the
judge.
you
say,
judge,
2
months
ago
the
defendant
came
to
you
and
said,
i
waive
the
speedy
trial
act.
now
the
defendant
says,
judge,
i
now
would
like
a
month's
continuance.
the
judge
says,
i'll
give
it
to
you.
the
opposing
counsel
says
why.
he
says,
because
he
waived
it.
now,
you're
telling
me
that,
one,
he
cannot
waive
it,
but
two,
even
though
the
judge
said
i
did
it
because
he
waived
it,
that
still
itself
is
okay.
we
go
ahead
and
let
him
exclude
it
because
the
judge
might
have
done
something
differently.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
possible
you
could
argue,
looking
at
the
record,
that
the
judge
should
have
tried
it...
should
have
excluded
it
on
a
different
basis.
he
should
have
excluded
it
on
the
basis
of
the
interests
of
justice,
et
cetera
required.
so
what
the
judge
said,
just
to
make
it
clear,
is
i'm
not
even
thinking
about
this
different
basis,
though
i
might.
i'm
doing
it
just
because
he
waived
it.
and
now
you're
telling
me,
i
take
it,
he
can't
waive
it,
but
nonetheless,
the
error
is
harmless
because
he
waived
it,
or
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
harmless.
you're
saying
it's
a
procedural
error.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
don't
say
the
judge
is
right
because
he
waived
it.
we're
saying
he's
right
because
the
judge
made
a
procedural
error.
i'm
having
a
hard
time
following
that.
