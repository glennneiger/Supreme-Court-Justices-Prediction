mr.
daryl
joseffer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
on
the
first
of
the
time
periods,
it
might
help
if
i
could
start
by
laying
out
three
basic
principles.
the
first
is
that
a
defendant
may
not
opt
out
of
the
act
by
waiver.
the
second
is
that
a...
a
defendant
is,
nonetheless,
precluded
from
challenging
the
grant
of
a
continuance
that
he
requested
if
the
continuance
satisfies
the
substantive
ends
of
justice
standards
of
the
act
and
the
defendant's
waiver
or
other
litigation
conduct
induced
the
court
to
commit
the
procedural
error
of
not
recording
an
ends
of
justice
finding
in
the
record.
and
the
third
related
point,
although
it's
not
presented
here,
is
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
recognized
that
if
a
defendant
requests
an
ends
of
justice
continuance
and
the
court
in
a
procedurally
regular
manner
grants
the
ends
of
justice
continuance,
the
defendant
cannot
later
be
heard
to
contend
that
there
was...
the
ends
of
justice
were
not
really
satisfied
even
though
he
had
told
the
court
that
they
were.
we
think
the
reasons
for
those
three
rules
stems
from
the
reason
that
defendants
cannot
opt
out
of
the
act
in
the
first
place.
although
the
act
does
not
contain
an
express
anti
waiver
or
anti
estoppel
provision,
it
does
manifest
an
intent
to
bind
defendants
to
its
requirements
in
order
to
protect
the
public
interest
in
a
speedy
trial.
if
a
defendant
could
opt
out
of
the
act
altogether
and
thereby
obtain
delays
that
are
not
authorized
by
the
act,
that
would
thwart
the
public
interest
in
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
guess
there...
there
are
couple
things
there.
one
is
that
we
are
not...
we...
we
are
not
here
relying
on
the
waiver
for
all
time.
our
point,
instead,
here
is
that
when
defendant
requested
the
continuance
at
issue
here,
it
was
the
defendant
that
said,
your
honor,
i...
i
need
a
continuance
and
i
waive
my
rights
so
you
should
give
me
the
continuance
and
then
also
said
he
needed
additional
preparation
time.
the
court
then...
and
this...
this
is
at
j.a.
from
about
page
81
to
85.
the
court
then
said,
well,
why
do
you
need
the
time?
and
the
court
discussed
with
him
for
a
while
why
he
really
needed
additional
preparation
time,
reminded
counsel
that,
notwithstanding
the
waiver,
this
was
a
criminal
case
and
criminal
cases
do
need
to
be
tried,
and
ended
up
balancing
the
defendant's
desire
for
preparation
against
the
need
for
a
speedy
trial
by
granting
a
much
shorter
continuance
than
requested.
and
that
is
actually
an
entirely
appropriate
ends
of
justice
balancing,
ends
of
justice
reasoning.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
think
you're
absolutely
right
that
the
court
was
not,
at
that
point,
thinking
in
terms
of
applying
the
speedy
trial
act.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
no.
our...
i
mean,
we
think
there
are
two
related
points.
one
is
that
a
genuine
opt
out
of
the
waiver
and
a
general
opt
out
of
the
act,
an
attempt
to
obtain
time
that's
not
excludable
under
the
act
is
not
permissible
because
that
would
thwart
the
public
interest
in
a
speedy
trial.
but
where
the
error
is
a
purely
procedural
one,
a
failing
to
record
findings
in
the
record
regarding
a
continuance
that
is
permitted
under
the
substantive
standards
of
the
act,
then
holding
the
defendant
to
the
waiver,
under
a
theory
of
either
waiver
or
estoppel...
in
our
view
it
doesn't
matter
which--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--complex
defendants
can
make
for
complex
cases.
[laughter]
and
this
is,
i
think,
the
ultimate
example
of
that.
but
in
addition,
it's
important
to
remember
that
at
the
end
of
this
90-day
period
that
was
granted,
defense
counsel
withdrew
on
the
ground
that
his
client
was
still
insisting
that
he
present
the
frivolous
defense
that...
that
the
bonds
were
genuine.
and
before
withdrawing
and
telling
the
court
that,
the...
the
defense
counsel
had
a
very
serious
to
his
client
and
the
court
to
continue
to
investigate
what
his
client
was
saying
was
the
defense
and
to
continue
to
try
to
work
with
his
client
and
try
to
come
up
with
a
plausible
defense
strategy.
now,
it
didn't
work
and
counsel
had
to
withdraw,
but
i
don't
think
he
can
be
faulted
for
trying.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no.
the
government...
i
mean,
on
the
one
hand,
the
government
did
not
seek
these
delays,
did
not
encourage
the
waiver,
did
not
rely
on
the
waiver
at
the...
at
the
relevant
times.
however,
at
the
time...
i
mean--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right,
and
at
the
time
of...
of
this...
this
was
about
10
years
ago
now...
the
second
circuit
recently
held
that
waiver
is
not
ordinarily
appropriate,
but
sometimes
is.
and
so
everyone
in
the
bar,
i
mean,
has
been
acting
under
some...
some
confusion,
we
think,
that...
that
frankly,
to
some
extent,
persists
to
this
day.
we
think
that
the
best
way
to
clarify
matters
going
forward
is...
is
a
combination
of
the
two
things
i
mentioned
earlier,
to
say,
first,
defendants
cannot
opt
out
of
the
act
by
waiver,
to
just
try
to
discourage
waivers.
but
to
say
that
mistakes
will
happen
and
that
when
a...
a
continuance...
when
a
court
grants
a
specific
continuance
that
is
authorized
under
the
substantive
standards
of
the
act,
that
at
that
point
in
time,
the
defendant's
waiver
or
other
conduct
that
induces
a
court
not
to
make
the
findings
prevents
the
defendant
from
trying
to
seize
on
a
purely
procedural
violation
on
appeal
because
at
that
point...
remember,
the...
the
reason
for...
for
a...
a
partial
anti
waiver
rule
here
is
not
that
there's
a
specific
anti
waiver
or
anti
estoppel
provision
in
the
act.
it's
that
congress
has,
on
the
whole,
manifested
an
intent
to
protect
the
public
interest
in
a
speedy
trial.
but
if
the
time
is
excludable
under
the
substantive
standards
of
the
act,
a
purely
procedural
error
does
not
diminish
the
public's
interest
in
a
speedy
trial
because
the--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--we
think
that,
legally
speaking,
all
that
matters
is
that
the
court
could
have,
and
that
once--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--in...
in
some
instances,
it
may
add
to
an
additional
degree
of
complexity,
although
i'll
say
that
whatever
that
might
be,
it's
still
less
than
the
complexity
of
retrying
the
case.
and
also,
i
think
more
often
than
not,
on
the
face
of
the
record...
i
mean,
these...
these
determinations
can
be
made.
here,
for
example...
i
mean,
if...
if
a
court
grants
a
continuance
for
any
reason,
it's
going
to
ask
the
reasons
why.
here,
the
court
questioned
counsel
as
to
whether
he
really
needed
more
time,
explained
his
basic
reasoning
for
doing
so.
and
so
when...
when
it's
apparent
on
the
record
that
a
continuance
could
have
been
granted,
that's
certainly
a
much
less
complex--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
you
would
need
more
on
the
record
there
because
if
the
record
was
limited
to
what
you
just
said,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
basis
for--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--at
this...
at
this
point
we're
not
at
the
harmlessness
point
yet.
this
would
be--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right,
and--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
anytime
you're
talking
about
a
waiver
or
estoppel
theory,
the
premise
is
that
there...
there
may
well
have
been
underlying
error,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
defendant
is
precluded.
and
here,
there's
no
question
there
was
an
underlying
error
because
the
findings
were
not
required...
were
not
reported
in
the
act.
but
the
act
does...
again,
does
not
contain
an
express
anti
waiver
provision,
and
the
speedy
trial
interests,
which
are
the
reason
for
reading,
to
some
extent,
an
anti
waiver
provision,
are...
are
not
diminished
when
the
court
have
properly
excluded
the
time
from
the
act.
and
to
the
contrary,
speedy
trial
interests
would
be
harmed
in
that
manner
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
gives
defendants
every
reason
to
delay
in
hopes
of
manufacturing
a
speedy
trial
violation.
second,
waiver
and
estoppel
are
generally
important
to
the
efficient
and
orderly
conduct
of
litigation,
and
if
you
take
those...
that
out,
what
you
will
get
is
less
efficient
litigation
and
more
delays,
which
congress
recognized
when,
as
part
of
the
speedy
trial
act,
it
required
the
courts
to
develop
management
plans
for
the
efficient
handling
of
cases.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no.
our...
our
view
is
that,
i
mean,
like
anytime
the
waiver
or
estoppel
is
at
issue,
one
could
say
that
that's
being
read
into
the
statute,
but
the
point,
as
this
court
has
explained
in
hillen
and...
and
mezzanatto,
is
that
those
are
background
principles
of
law
that
presumptively
apply.
our
view
is
this.
a
court
should
make
the
finding,
but
a...
a
defendant
may
not
challenge
the
finding
if
a
few
conditions
are
satisfied.
first,
the
defendant
was
the
one
requesting
the
continuance
and
benefitting
from
it.
second,
the
finding
could
have
been
made
on
the
record
in
the
case,
and
third,
the
defendant
is
responsible
in
some
way
for
inducing
the
court
not
to
make
the
finding.
it
could
be
by
a
waiver
or
it
could
be
the
defendant's...
or
it
could
be
the
court
saying,
i've
decided
it's
appropriate
to
make
an
ends
of
justice
finding.
now,
let
me
record
this
in
the
record,
and
defense
counsel
saying,
your
honor,
please
don't
bother.
it's
late.
we've
got
four
more
things
to
do.
we
don't
need
the
findings.
in
that
circumstance
as
well,
it's
not
a
waiver,
but
defense
counsel
would
have...
the
defendant
at
that
point
should
not
be
heard
to
complain
about
the
absence
of
a--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
i
mean,
there
are
two
concerns.
one
is,
as
you
said,
the...
the
cost
of
having
to
deal
with
a
brand
new
jury
trial
after
you've
already
done
a
fair
one.
the
second
is
that...
i
mean,
in
this
case,
the
trial
was
3
years
ago.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
oh,
i...
well,
if
dismissal
was
required
in
this
case,
i
think
dismissal
would
be
without
prejudice
as
opposed
to
with
prejudice
and
therefore--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--if
there
had
not
already
been...
oh.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
this
is
pretrial.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
oh,
there's
already
been
a
trial.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
okay.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
see.
it's
dismissed
before
trial.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
i
understand.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
sorry.
i
understand.
yes,
if...
if
pretrial
the
district
court
dismisses,
then
the
government
ordinarily
can
reindict
for...
if
the
court
dismisses
without
prejudice,
the
government
ordinarily
could
reindict
very
quickly,
and
the
cost
to
the
system
would
not
be
great.
the
real
cost
to
the
system
comes
in
when
the
district
court
does
not
dismiss
and
holds
the
trial
because
then
the
trial
has
been
held
and
then
by
the
time
you
get
back
down
to
the
trial
court...
i
mean,
in
this
case,
it'll
probably
be
4
years.
and
at
that
point,
sometimes
you
can
do
a
retrial,
but
sometimes
memories
fade,
witnesses
are
lost,
other
sources
of
proof
are
lost.
and
as
a
result,
you
end
up
with...
with
fairly...
you
can
end
up
with
very
severe
consequences
in
situations
where
the
first
trial
is
held.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no.
there's
a...
the
judicial
code
contains
a...
a
provision
that
generally
contains
a
6-month
grace
period
for
limitations
following
dismissal
by
a
court.
so
we
would
have...
i
mean,
by
now
the
limitations
period
would
have
run,
but
we
would
have
6
months
to...
to
reindict.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
i
think
that
when
a...
when
a
litigant
expressly
waives
his
rights
under
an
act,
that
the
very
natural
effect
of
that
is
to
make
the
court
think
he
does
not
have
to
follow
that
act
and
that
would
include
the
findings
requirement.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no.
it
was
the...
i
mean,
in
context,
there
were
two...
at
the
earlier
status
conference
that
does
not
relate
to
this
hearing,
but
at
the
earlier
status
conference,
it
was
defendant
who
said,
your
honor,
i
want
a
continuance
and
i
want
to
waive
my
rights.
in
response
to
defendant's
invocation
of
a
waiver,
the
court
said,
well,
if
you're
going
to
waive,
you
have
to
waive
for
all
time,
because
the
court
was
concerned
the
defendant
would
selectively
waive
until
it
was
inconvenient
for
the
court
to
try
the
case.
we
don't
defend
the
court's
response
to
that,
but
the
point
is
that
even
then
it
was
the
defendant
who
raised
waiver
first.
and
then
at
this
status
conference
regarding
this
particular
continuance,
it
was...
defendant
was
the
only
one
talking
about
waiver.
defendant
said...
defendant
initially
raised
it
and
said
i...
i
waive
my
rights,
then
came
back
to
it
again.
i
waive
my
rights,
just
give
me
the
continuance.
and
the
court
said...
i
mean,
the
court
did
say
that,
well,
if
you've
already
waived,
you
don't
have
to
again.
but
he
then
said
that,
notwithstanding
the
waiver,
he
couldn't
give
the
defendant
an
open
ended
amount
of
time
because
this
is
a
criminal
trial.
so
it
was
defendant
who
was...
who
was
pressing
this
at
all
times.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
think
that
happens
with
some
regularity.
there's
quite
a
lot
of
court
of
appeals
case
law
in
which
defendants
are
protesting
speedy
trial
violations.
i
mean,
actually
quite
a
lot.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
yes.
in
the...
in
the
court
of...
the
answer
your
first
question,
in
the
court
of
appeals...
we
referred
to
our
argument
as
one
of
waiver
rather
than
estoppel,
in
part
because
that's
what
the
second
circuit
had
in...
in
the
past
referred
to
it
as
being.
and
yes,
in
substance,
we
were...
we...
we
raised...
i
mean,
we
were
raising
a
similar
waiver
argument
below
as
the
one
that
we
are
now.
we
don't
think
it
matters
greatly
whether
one
calls
it
waiver
or
estoppel,
except
that
we
do
think
that
estoppel
is
the...
is
the...
the
preferable
way
of
looking
at
because
we're...
as...
as
has
been
pointed
out,
we're
talking
here
not
just
about
a
waiver,
but
also
about
a
situation
where
a
defendant
requests
relief--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes.
i
mean,
here
the...
the
defendant
is
affirmatively
requesting
relief
on
the
basis
of
one...
one
position
and
is
now
seeking
dismissal
based
on
the
fact
that
his
first
position
was
accepted
and
received
that
relief.
and
that's
a
situation
in
which
judicial
estoppel
is...
is,
frankly,
tailor
made
for,
and
i
think
the
fact
that
judicial
estoppel
prevents
that
very
situation
helps
to
underscore
the...
that
if...
if
congress
really
wanted
to--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
i
think
the...
i
mean,
i...
i
agree
that...
i
mean,
whether
it's
waiver
or
it's
estoppel,
if
congress
manifests
an
affirmative
intent
to
displace
those
doctrines,
they
don't
apply.
and
it
doesn't
matter
which...
which
one
you're
under.
but
the...
the
affirmative
intent
that
congress
manifested
here,
notwithstanding...
i
mean,
remember,
there's
no
express
anti
waiver
or
anti
estoppel
provision,
but
the
affirmative
intent
is
to
protect
the
public's
interest
in
a
speedy
trial.
and
that...
that
intent
is
entirely
protected
when
a
delay
could
be...
is
permitted
by
the
substantive
standards
of
the
act,
and
the
only
error
is
a
procedural
one
that
the
defendant
helped
to
induce
the
court
to
commit.
and
i
mentioned...
in
that
circumstance,
there's
not
only
no
delay
that
was
not
contemplated
by
congress.
but
as
i
mentioned
before
there
are
three
reasons
that
permitting
a
defendant
to
seek
dismissal
in
that
circumstance
would
actually
harm
speedy
trial
rights.
first,
the
incentive
for
defendants
to
delay.
second,
the
inefficiency,
and
the
third
is
that,
remember,
one
of
the
main
reasons,
if
not
the
main
reason,
that
congress
wanted
speedy
trials
was
that
it
was
concerned
that
defendants
out
on
bail
were
committing
crimes.
and
congress'
concern
with
crime
prevention
is
not
served
in
the
least
by
letting
a
defendant
seek
dismissal
of
an
indictment
based
on
a
purely
procedural
error
that
he
helped
to
cause.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
the
question
then
would
be
harmless
error
analysis.
i
mean,
we
agree
the
statute
requires
the
finding
to
be
made.
it
was
not
made.
therefore,
there
was
an
error.
and
it's
the
defendant
inducing
the
court
to--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no.
if...
if
one
moved
beyond
the
inducement
and
into
harmless
error,
the
question
would
be...
would
be
that
there
here
the...
the
error...
i
think
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
error
here
would
be
the
failure...
would...
would
be
the
clerical
one,
the
error
to
record
findings
in
the
act.
and
i
think...
and
we
would
agree
that
the
act...
pointing
to
the
second
question
now.
but
the
act
does
expressly
say
that
if
a
defendant
is
not
tried
within
70
relevant
days,
the
indictment
shall
be
dismissed.
and
that
suggests
that
harmless
error
analysis
would
not
be
appropriate
to
the
question
whether
71
or
81
days
of
delay
is
appropriate
because
congress
said
70
is
70.
but
when
the
error
is
not
that,
but
the
error
is
failing
to
record
something
in
the
record,
that's
a
distinct
type
of
error
that's
not
covered
by
the
mandatory
dismissal
provision.
and
it
could
be
considered
harmless,
especially
in
circumstances
where
the
record
reflects--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
i...
i
agree
that...
that
section
(h)(8)
is
different
from
the
incompetency
exclusion,
for
example,
which
i'll
turn
to
in
a
minute,
in
that
does
tie
the...
the
findings
to
the
excludability.
and
that
makes
the...
the
harmless
error
argument
that
we
have
on
that
issue,
obviously,
more
difficult
than
on
the...
the
incompetency
issue.
but
it's
still...
i
think
it
ultimately
comes
down
to
how
you...
how
you
view
the
error.
is
the
error
not
trying
someone
within
70
days,
or
is
the
error
not
recording
a
finding
in
the
record?
and
if...
if
you
focus
on...
on
the
findings
aspect--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right,
and
then...
but
the...
but
the...
i
mean,
ordinarily
that...
just
not
complying
with
the
act
generally
is
harmless,
and
the
question
would
be
is...
is
that...
because,
remember,
the...
the
only
thing
that's
subject
to
mandatory
dismissal
is
not
trying
someone
within
70
relevant
days.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
and
then,
i
mean,
if
that's
the
way
it's
viewed,
then
on
the
first
time
period,
the
(h)(8),
then
we
would
stand
on
our...
stand
on
either
of
the...
the
waiver
and
estoppel
argument
or
also
on
the
possibility
that
another
middle
ground
would
be
if
what
we're
missing
is
a
finding
in
the
record,
the
other
option
would
be
to
remand
for
the
court
to
clarify
the
record.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
and
obviously,
ordinarily
courts
would
not
be
doing
that.
it's
a
very
inefficient
thing
to
do
in
the
ordinary
course.
but
here,
where
the
transcript
does
reflect
the
court
actually
considered,
on
the
one
hand,
the
defendant's
need
for
additional
time
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
interest
in
trying...
trying
criminal
cases
sooner
rather
than
later
and
balanced
them
by
granting
a--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--it
does
seem
more
reasonable.
but--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--at...
at
the
time,
i
mean,
there
was...
there
was...
especially
this
was
10
years
ago.
there
was,
in
some
sense
still
is,
quite
a
lot
of
confusion
in
the
bar
on
these
issues
because
there's
no
express
anti
waiver
provision.
there's
an
end,
and
as
i
said,
the...
the
second
circuit
in
gambino
had
held
waiver
is
not
ordinarily
appropriate,
but
had
not
said
it
was
never
appropriate.
so
there
was
some
confusion.
but
what...
what
the
government
never
did
was
to
encourage
a
waiver
or
to
encourage
any
of
these
delays
either.
now,
in
this...
i...
to
some
extent
in
the
second
question
presented
and
talking
about
the...
the
remand
and
the
harmlessness.
on
the
second
question
presented,
the
first
question
is
whether
the
incompetency
exclusion
applies
in
the
first
place.
in
our
view,
it's
a
very
simple
exclusion.
if...
if
delay
results
from
the
defendant's
incompetency,
the
time
is
excluded,
and
if
the
defendant
is
incompetent,
delay
results
from
that
because
a
person
cannot
be
tried
when
he
is
incompetent.
because
we
have
a
finding
here
the
defendant
was
incompetent
during
the
relevant
period
of
time,
the
exclusion
applies.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
the...
the
act
has
a
lengthy
series
of
these
resulting
from
exclusions,
and
with
the
exception
of
(h)(8),
which
is
unusual
in
terms
of
the
ends
of
justice
finding,
these
operate
automatically
as
this
court
said
in
henderson.
it's...
it's
an
objective
standard.
if...
if
the
defendant
could
not
have
been
tried
then,
then
the
delay
resulted,
at
least
as
a
concurrent
cause,
from
that.
and
there's...
and
it's...
it's
very
important
to
understand
too
that
in
the
context
of
especially
the...
the
exclusion
for
when
pretrial
motions
are
pending,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
unanimously
held
that
a
more
complicated
causation
analysis
not
only
is
not
required
but
would
throw
a
wrench
into
the
practical
application
of
the
act
because
what
happens,
for
example,
is
someone
files
a
pretrial
motion
and
the
parties
assume
that
the...
the
clock
is
turned
off
then
for
at
least
some
time.
but
a
defendant
later
argues
that,
well,
the
same
delay
would
have
resulted
anyway
because,
say,
the
judge
was
on
vacation
or
the
judge
was
planning
on
recusing
himself
and
reassigning
the
case.
and
at
that
point,
the
courts
have
recognized
that
you
don't
look
to
try
to
figure
out
which
of
several
potential
causes
is...
is
the
relevant
one.
they're
all
potential
objective
concurrent
causes,
and
any
other
approach
would
make
it
very
difficult
to
administer
the
act.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i...
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
presume
that
an
article
iii
judge
would
have
a
defendant
imprisoned
and
committed
if
he
was
not
actually
incompetent.
but
you
are
right
that
the
incompetency
exclusion
is...
is,
along
with
the
unavailability
of
the
defendant
or
witness
exclusions,
are
somewhat
unusual
in
that
you
could
discover,
after
the
fact,
that
they
applied.
but
the
reason
is
that
if...
if
you
had
tried
to
try
him
sooner,
you
would
have
discovered
the
same
thing.
he
actually
was
incompetent.
the
witness
actually
was
unavailable.
and
from
a
speedy
trial
act
perspective,
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
the
speedy
trial
clock
ran
because
you
didn't
try
a
defendant
when
he
was
legally
unable
to
be
tried.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
we
haven't
relied
on
that
because
that
would
have
been
the...
that...
that's
an
appropriate
basis
for
an
ends
of
justice
continuance,
but
no
continuance
was
ever
sought
or
granted
for
the
relevant
period.
so
we...
although
that
is
true
that
an
ends
of
justice
continuance
might
have
been
granted
for
that
reason,
there
was
no
continuance
of
any
kind
granted
during
that
period.
so
we're
relying
solely
on
the
plain
language
of
the
incompetency
exclusion.
if
you
think
about
it--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no.
we...
we...
no.
with
respect
to
the
first
time
period,
we're
relying
on
the
specific
waiver
that
was
tendered
in
connection
with
that
actual
continuance.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
oh,
the
defendant
was
incompetent
the
whole
time?
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no.
there
was...
actually
earlier
on
in
the
case,
there
was...
there
were
three
competency
hearings.
the
first
one,
he
was
held
competent,
and
that...
that
was
earlier
on
in
the
proceedings.
the
finding
of
incompetency
in
the
record
here
is
the
defendant
found
the
defendant
incompetent
at
the
end
of
the
relevant
period
based
entirely
on
evidence
and
argument
presented
at
the
beginning
of
the
relevant
period.
so
when
the...
when
the
court
held
the
defendant
must
be
incompetent
based
on
that
evidence,
he
was
saying
the
defendant...
necessarily
was
saying
the
defendant
must
have
been
incompetent
during
the
entire
relevant
period
based
on
the
evidence
from
the
beginning
of
the
period.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no.
i'm
sorry.
it
is
(h)(4).
(h)(1)(a)
deals
with
proceedings
regarding
the
defendant's
incompetency.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
and
that
applies
whether
the
defendant
is
competent
or
not.
we're
relying
on
(h)(4)
which
applies
when
the
defendant
was
incompetent.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
i'm
happy
to
move
to
that
as
well,
but
before
that,
i
mean,
it
is...
there
can
be
concurrent
causes
and
there
can
be
objective
concurrent
causes.
and
the
defendant
could
not
have
been
tried
during
the
relevant
time
period,
and
therefore,
objectively
speaking,
that
was...
i
mean,
if
the...
if
the
court
had
tried
to
try
him--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--during
the
relevant
time
period,
he
couldn't.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
i
think
congress...
you're
right
that
it's
based
in
part
on
the
principle
that,
look,
of
course,
he
couldn't
have
been
tried
then.
but,
you
know,
congress
also
made
that
relevant
whether
there's
a
violation
at
all.
just
to
simplify
things,
let's
take
that
off
the
table.
if
the
defendant
is
incompetent,
there
certainly
couldn't
be
a
constitutional
speedy
trial
act
violation.
let's
just
take
it
off
the
table
for...
for
the
act
purposes
as
well.
the
argument
has
been
made
that--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--if
i
could
answer
the
question.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
the...
the
fact--
[laughter]
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i...
i...
i'll
try
to
give
a
cleverly
disguised
answer.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
the...
the
fact
existed
all
along.
i
mean,
the...
the
fact
doesn't
come
into
existence
once
it's
found.
the
finding
reflects
the
fact
that
the
fact
of
an
incompetency
had
existed
during
the
entire
relevant
period.
