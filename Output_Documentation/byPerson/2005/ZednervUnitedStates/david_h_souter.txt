justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't...
isn't
the
difference
that
in
the
latter
period,
the
court
took
no
action,
and
there
is
a
mandate
on
the
court
to
act?
with
respect
to
this
earlier
period,
the
court
did
act.
incidentally,
it
did
exactly
what
the
defendant
wanted
it
to
do,
but
it
acted
so
that
the
only...
the
only
reason
for
arguing
error
here
is,
in
effect,
a
clerical
reason.
he
didn't
say
the
magic
words
or
make
the
magic
conclusion.
if,
in
fact,
that's
because
he
couldn't
have
made
it,
no
question.
you...
you
got
a
violation
of
the
statute.
but
if
he
could
have
made
it
and...
and
simply
didn't
say
the
magic
words,
you're
in
a
very
different
position
here
from
what
you
are
in...
in
the
case
of...
of
the
failure
to
act
on
the...
on
the
competency
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
it's
a
failure
to
speak
rather
than
a
failure
to
act.
in...
in
the
latter
case,
no
action.
in
this
case,
action,
in
fact,
action
as
more...
it's
as
requested.
but
a
failure
to
speak
contemporaneously
with
the
action,
that's
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
don't...
we
don't
know.
i
mean,
on
the
face
of
the
record,
we
don't
know
whether
he
weighed
or
whether
he
didn't
weigh.
in
the
second
case,
we
know
that
he
didn't
act,
and...
and
action
is
what
he's
got
to...
to
accomplish.
but
whether
he
weighed
or
not,
we
don't
know.
he
just
didn't
say
whether
he
weighed.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i...
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it's...
it
requires...
in
order
for
us
to
conclude
that
that's
the
only
way
it
can
be
taken
account...
into
account,
we...
we'd
have
to
conclude
that...
that
rule
52
was,
in
effect,
partially
repealed
and
made
inapplicable
implicitly
here
without
any
reference
to
it.
and
that's...
that
kind
of,
let's
say,
implicit
modification
of...
of
one
of
the
rules
is,
as
a
matter
of
normal
interpretation,
disfavored.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
always
some
sanction
for
error,
and
the
point
of
the
harmless
error
rule
is
to
determine
whether
that
specific
sanction
should
be
applied.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
there
something
more
than
a
waiver
here?
i
mean,
waiver
is
a
very
broad
term.
i
mean,
it
would
cover
a
situation,
for
example,
in
which
the
government
asked
for
time
and
the
defendant
said,
okay,
i
waive.
in...
in
this
case,
there's...
there's
an
affirmative
act
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
he's
not
merely
waiving.
he
is
affirmatively
asking
for
action
on
the
part
of
the
court,
and
subject
i
guess
to
cutting
down
the
period
somewhat,
he
got
what
he
asked
for.
this
is
something
more
than
waiver.
this
is,
in
fact,
a...
a
grant
of
specific
relief
requested
by
him,
and
he
now
wants
to
turn
the
tables
based
on
receiving
exactly
what
he
asked
for.
that's
more
than
waiver.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
hasn't
my
brother
cleverly
changed
my
hypothetical?
because
i
was--
[laughter]
--i
was
not
talking
about
the
perpetual
waiver.
i
was
talking
about
the
waiver
for
whatever
number
of
days
he
actually
took
in...
in
that
case,
which
was
what?
90
days?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
could
have
come
from
my
chambers.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you...
you
made
an
argument
a
moment
ago
which
included
the
point
that
he
asked
for
this
particular
relief
and
represented
what
he
needed
to
do
if
he
got
the
relief,
the
continuance.
you...
you
came
right
up
within
a
step
of...
of
making
a
judicial
estoppel
claim,
although
you
did
not
use
those
terms.
i
have
two
questions.
did
the
government
raise
at
least
the...
the
theory
of
judicial
estoppel
in
the
litigation
before
it
reached
this
point?
and
the
second
question
is,
even
if
the
government
did
not
raise
that
term,
asked
for...
for
estoppel
to
be
applied
in
those
terms,
did
the
government
make
the
same
argument
that
you
have
just
made
which
emphasizes
the
fact
that
he
asked
for
it
and
he
represented
the
reasons
for...
for
needing
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
the
difference
between
acquiescence
and...
and
potentially
sandbagging.
justice
david
h.
souter
am...
am
i
correct
that
the...
the
particular
provision
that
you
think
is
relevant
here
is...
is
(h)(1)(a)
on
page
4
of
the...
the
appendix
in
the
blue
brief?
justice
david
h.
souter
i've...
i've
got
it.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
do
you
make
of
the
language,
any
period
of
delay
resulting
from
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
mentally
incompetent?
i
mean,
the
claim
here
is
that...
that
the...
that
the
delay
did
not
result
from
that
fact,
but
simply
from
the
failure
of...
of
the
judge
to
make
that
determination
so
that
what
you're
really
doing
is
making
a
harmless
error
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
isn't
that
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
that
a
harmless
error
analysis
rather
than
a...
a
subsection
(4)
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
i
guess
my
only
point
is
that
(4)
does
not
say
any
period
during
which
the
defendant
is
mentally
incompetent.
it
says
any
period
of
delay
resulting
from
the
fact
that
he
was
mentally
incompetent,
and
this
did
not
result
from
that
fact
until
at
the
end
of
the
period
the
judge
says,
oh,
i
find
him
incompetent,
so
that
any
period
after
that
would
be
the
result
of
the
fact
that
he
was
incompetent.
but
the...
the
delay
up
to
that
point
was
attributable
solely
to
the
judge's
failure
to
make
a
determination.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
was...
it
was
cleverly
disguised,
but
it
really
was
a
question.
[laughter]
