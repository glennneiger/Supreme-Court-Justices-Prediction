justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about,
mr.
zas,
that
the
court
thought
it
was
home
free
on
the
speedy
trial
act?
after
all,
it
had
gotten
a
waiver
for
all
time.
isn't
that
why
the
165
days?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who...
who
could
complain?
because
in...
in
all
of
these
instances,
it
was
the
defendant
who
sought
the
enlarged
time.
in
fact,
even
though
the
judge
had
given...
gotten
this
all
purpose
waiver,
he
didn't
give
defense
counsel
as
much
time
as
defense
counsel
asked
for
to...
to
investigate
the
genuineness
of
the
bond.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
long
as
they're
not
in
jail
pending
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this...
this
was
a
judge
who
apparently
was
doing
this
as
a...
a
matter
of
standard
practice.
he
had
a
form
that
he
whipped
out.
it
must
be
a
very
old
form.
it
looked
like
it
was
typed
on
a
regular
typewriter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
can
we
say
it's
purely
procedural
with
respect
to
the
first
time?
i
mean,
the
reason
that
was
given
is
i
have
to...
i
need
this
time
to
find
out
if
these
really
peculiar
looking
bonds
are
genuine.
now,
the...
the
second
circuit
said...
and
i
don't
understand
why
they
said
this...
this
is
a
complex
case
so
that
continuance
is
warranted.
was
this
a
complex
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this...
is
there
a
statute
of
limitations
problem
in...
in
these
cases
if
their
dismissal
is
without
prejudice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
in
this
case,
the
judge
told
the
defendant
i've
got
a
solution
to
this.
here's
my
form.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
is
that...
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
judge,
of
course,
would
clarify
it
and
say
ends
of
justice,
if
we
took
your
remand
solution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case,
that...
that
all
purpose
waiver
that
the
judge
and
not
for
the
first
time
proposed
is...
is
what
caused
all
this.
and...
and
my
question
that
i
had
is
knowing
that
this
was
the
judge's
practice...
and
indeed,
he
had
written
about
it...
did
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
try
to
do
something
to
say,
look,
the
act
doesn't
permit
that
kind
of
thing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you...
are
you
relying
to
any
extent
on
something
that
i
think
you
brought
up?
he
also
could
not
have
been
tried
because
the
prosecutor
was
having
a
difficult
pregnancy
and
she
was
on
extended
leave,
which
was
occurring
in
this
period?
