chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
zedner
v.
united
states.
mr.
zas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
he
make
an
ends
of
justice
finding
for
all
time?
could
he
start
at
the
beginning,
any
continuance
i
grant
is
granted
after
my
weighing
the
different
factors
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
it's
in
the
ends
of
justice?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
joseffer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the...
the
argument
you're
making
is
really
one
of
invited
error,
and
i'm
not
sure
it
even
applies
on
these
facts.
i
mean,
the...
the
defense
lawyer
didn't,
as
you
hypothesized
in
one
of
your
answers,
say
something
to
the
effect
of
don't
worry,
you
don't
need
to
make
any
findings
of
the
ends
of
justice
or
anything
like
that.
he
just
said
i'm
waiving
my
speedy
trial
rights,
and
that
may
mean
he's
not
gong
to
argue,
you
know,
that
the
ends
of
justice
don't
justify
it
or
whatever.
he's
just
saying
i
don't
have
any
objection.
maybe
he
assumed
that
the
judge
would
go
on
and
say,
okay,
i'm
making
the
findings
required
by
subsection
8(a).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
do
you...
why
do
you
put
that
in
a
separate
category?
it's
kind
of
unusual
for
congress
to
put
that
type
of
a
requirement
in
the
statute.
they
could
have
normally...
i
suspect
they
normally
would
write
it.
you
know,
you...
you...
they're
excludable
only
if
the
court
finds
in
the
interest
of
justice.
but
they
went
further
and
they
said
if
the
court
sets
forth
orally
or
in
writing
in
the
record
of
the
case.
i
mean,
they
set
it
forth
as
a
separate
requirement.
i
don't
know
that
we
can
give
it
sort
of
a
second
class
status.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
say
the
error
is
not
complying
with
the
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
that...
pardon?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
incompetency
exclusion,
we
still
have
to
reach
the
waiver
for
all
time
question.
correct?
you
don't
argue
that
the
incompetency
goes
back
that
far,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
not
suggesting
he
was
incompetent
during
that
period
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it
was
a
question,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
zas,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
goes
back
some
way
because
he's
looking
at
reports
from
those
earlier
times.
it's
not
only
effective
as
of
the
date
he
makes
the
finding.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
in
05-5992,
zedner
versus
united
states.
