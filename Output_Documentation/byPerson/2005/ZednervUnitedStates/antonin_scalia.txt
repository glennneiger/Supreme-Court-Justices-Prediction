justice
antonin
scalia
the
delay...
the
delay
was
not
because
we
can't
try
this
man
because
he's
incompetent,
and
until
he's
rendered
competent,
we...
we
have
to
stay
proceedings.
that
wasn't
the
basis
at
all.
it
was
just
i
haven't
made
up
my
mind
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what
is
specifically
precluded
by
the
requirement
that...
that
you
act
within
30
days,
and...
and
all
the
rest
of
the
time,
the
clock
is
running.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
it's...
it's
not
harmless
error
if
they
didn't
make
the
finding
but...
but
could
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
think
he
needed
it.
he
had
a
perpetual
waiver.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
zas,
are
you
going
to
talk
about
estoppel?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can.
did
he
ask
for
a
perpetual
waiver?
i
thought
the
way
the
colloquy
went,
the
judge
said,
no,
you
know,
i
can't
give
you
a
waiver
unless
you'll...
unless
you'll
make
it
a
perpetual
waiver.
and
then
he
said,
okay,
i'll
make
it
a
perpetual
waiver.
wasn't...
wasn't
the...
the
initiative
for
the
perpetual
waiver
from...
from
the
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
gothic
print,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
are
you
hypothesizing?
that
the
court
actually
made
this
finding
in
its
mind
but
just
didn't
express
it?
or
are
you
hypothesizing
that
the
court
could
have
made
it
but
didn't
make
it,
never
even
went
through
the
mental
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
have
made
it.
so...
so
we're
going
to...
why
can't
life
be
simple?
we're
going
to
have
to
have
trials
all
the
time
as
to
whether,
in
this
hypothetical
situation,
this
finding
could
have
been
made.
i
mean,
you
know,
this
creates
subsidiary
litigation
that
we
really
don't
need.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
you
know,
congress
could
have...
could
have
written
it
the
way...
the
way
you're
proposing
it.
congress
could
have
said,
you
know,
when
there...
when...
when
there
is
good
cause
for
the
continuance,
the
clock
won't
run.
it
didn't
say
that.
it...
it
said
the
judge
has
to
make
a
finding.
i
mean,
don't
we
have
to
give
that
some
effect?
you're
saying
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
he
makes
the
finding
or
not.
so
long
as
there
was
good
cause
so
that
a
finding
could
have
been
made,
that
will
be
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
except...
except
where
there's
a
public
policy
against
what
you
want
to
estop
him
into
doing.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
for
the
same
reason
that
you
don't
allow
a
waiver,
you
shouldn't
allow
an
estoppel.
there's
a
public
policy
against
it.
the...
the
congress
wanted
these
things
tried
promptly,
and...
and
whether
he
merely
waives
or...
or
goes
further
and
affirmatively
causes
the
court
to
do
something
which
it
shouldn't
have
done,
you're
just
as
much
violating
the
policy
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
what
you
say
is
true,
i
don't
know
why
it
makes
any
difference
that
the
defendant
led
the
court
into
it.
if
you...
if
you
believe
that
this
is
just
a
procedural
nicety
that
was
not
complied
with,
why
shouldn't
you
do
the
same
thing
when...
when
the
court
fails
to
make
the
finding
but
could
have
made
the
finding
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
the
one
that
led
him
into
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
within
70
relevant
days
counted
as
the
statute
requires
them
to
be
counted,
which
includes
the
requirement
of
this
finding
set
forth
in
the
record
before
you
can
stop
the
clock
running
for...
you
know,
for
some
period.
i
don't
think
that
that's...
i
don't
think
that's
very
complicated.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
was
not
known
at
the
time
that
he
was
incompetent.
and...
and
therefore,
that
could
not
have
been
the
reason
that
he
was
not
being
tried.
the
reason
he
was
not
being
tried
was
that
the...
that
there
was
pending
before
the
judge
the
inquiry
into
whether
he
was
competent.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
don't
know
the
answer
of
whether
the
clock
is
running
until
the
finding
is
made.
if
the...
if
the
judge
finds
that...
that
he's
not
incompetent,
well,
too
bad.
you
know,
the
speedy
trial
act
requires
dismissal.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
judge
finds
that
he
is
incompetent
to
be
tried,
there
hasn't
been
a
violation
of
the
act.
i
mean,
it's
a
very
strange
situation.
and
it
also,
as...
as
the...
the
other
points
out,
it...
it
puts
considerable
pressure
on
the
judge
when...
when
he
is
in
violation
of
the
speedy
trial
act,
to
find
that
the
individual
is
incompetent
because,
otherwise,
there
has
to
be
a
dismissal.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't...
isn't
that
so?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
you
can
be...
i'm
sorry.
