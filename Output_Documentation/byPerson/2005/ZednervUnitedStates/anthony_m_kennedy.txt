justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
not
quite
through
your
answer
yet,
but
is
there
also
a
requirement
that
the
competency
determination
be
made
within
30
days?
or
am
i...
am
i
in
error
on
that
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that...
but
that's
different,
i
take
it,
from
the
judge's
delay
in
making
the
finding
of
competency.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
the
trial...
the
speedy
trial
act
doesn't
say
if
the
judge
is
thinking
about
something,
it
requires
him
to
make
an
order.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
that.
or
could
he
vacate
submission
because
he
wants
new
evidence
or
something?
could
you
vacate
submission
of
the...
of
the
first
competency
hearing
in
order
to
take
new
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
we've
been
talking
about
the
competency
period.
i
take
it
the
first
period
was
one
of
just
repeated
requests
for
extensions.
that's
january
'97
until
may
'97.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
this...
that's
the
first
of
the
two
periods
that's
involved
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
if
it
makes
any
difference
to
the
case.
do
you...
do
you
think
the
court
could
have
made
findings
that
would
have
been
justified?
i
mean,
it
takes
a
while
to
find
an
expert
to
say
that
a
bond
is
genuine
when
it
spells
united
with
o,
but--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there...
are
there
cases
in
which
the
judge's
findings...
let's
assume
that
he
made
the
findings...
are
set
aside
for
abuse
of
discretion
on...
on
review
for
a
violation
of
the
speedy
trial
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
what
is
the
date
of
the
speedy
trial
act?
1975?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
was
widely
publicized
among
the
judiciary
then.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
as
we've
indicated,
the...
the
judge
was
the
one
that
opted
out
of
the
act
by
this
regular
practice
of
requiring
the
perpetual
waiver,
or
whatever
we
call
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
government
at
any
point
tell
the...
tell
the
court,
your
honor,
we
think
the
act
requires
you
to
make
a
specific
finding
and
we
request
you
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because,
i
mean,
you're...
you're
coming
in
and
saying,
oh,
well,
he
waived,
but
certainly
the
government
could...
could
have
asked
the...
asked
the
district
court
to
make
the
necessary
findings.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
government
is
equally
remiss
for
not
pointing
out
the
obligations
of
the
court
under
the
act.
let...
let
me
ask
you
this.
probably
you
can
respond
to
that
as
well.
one
of
the
problems
with
reindicting...
i
mean,
how...
how
is
the
government
hurt
if
it
can
reindict?
i
recognize
that
it's
costly
to
the
system,
et
cetera.
but
is
there
any
real
prejudice
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
i'm...
i'm
supposing
that
after
this
rule,
there
would
be
no
trial
because
there
would
be...
if...
if
you
don't
prevail,
there
wouldn't
be
a
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
asking
are
there...
are
there
severe
costs
with
that
when
there's
been
no
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's...
there's
no
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
action
is
dismissed
for
a
speedy
trial
act
violation
because
the
petition
of
the
petitioner
here
is
accepted
by
this
court
and
the
government
just
reindicts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
hypothesizing
that
there
hasn't
been.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
case
is
dismissed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there
is
a
reindictment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
costly
is
that
to
the
system
other
than
getting
the
grand
jury
together?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
harmless
error
because
he...
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
substantial?
what...
how
does
the
harmless
error
work?
