mr.
edward
scott
zas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
speedy
trial
act
protects
the
public,
as
well
as
the
personal
interests
of
defendants,
by
mandating
the
prompt
disposition
of
federal
criminal
prosecutions.
in
this
case,
the
government
and
the
district
court
failed
to
comply
with
the
clear
requirements
of
the
act.
as
relevant
here,
the
act
provides
that
the
trial
of
a
defendant
who
pleads
not
guilty
and
who
is
released
on
bail
shall
commence
within
70
days
after
the
indictment.
the
act,
however,
is
not
as
inflexible
as
it
sounds.
the
act
permits
numerous
categories
of
delay
to
be
excluded
from
the
70-day
limit.
the
act
also
provides
an
enforcement
mechanism.
if
more
than
70
nonexcludable
days
elapse
between
the
indictment
and
the
trial,
the
indictment
shall
be
dismissed.
this
case
concerns
two
periods
of
delay,
that
each
exceed
the
70-day
time
limit,
and
i'd
like
to
focus
initially
on
the
longer
period
of
delay.
this
is
the
delay
that
took
place
between
2000
and
2001,
after
a
competency
proceeding
was
taken
under
advisement.
just
to
put
this
delay
in
context,
a
competency
hearing
was
held
on
july
10,
2000.
the
judge
solicited
post
hearing
briefs.
the
matter
was
taken
under
advisement
on
august
23rd,
and
in
our
papers,
we
asked
the
judge
to
find
petitioner
competent
and
to
set
the
matter
for
trial
as
soon
as
possible.
we
noted
that
at
that
point
the
case
was
already
more
than
4
years
old.
we
offered
to
waive
a
jury
and
proceed
to
a
bench
trial
immediately.
and
at
that
point,
the
case
sat
idle
for
the
next
195
days.
now,
the
act
excludes
only
the
first
30
days
of
that
period.
that's
section
3161(h)(1)(j).
for
reasons
that
have
never
been
explained,
the
court
sat
on
the
proceeding.
when
7
months
went
by,
we
filed
a
motion.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
that
may
be,
justice
ginsburg,
but...
but
as
of
our
filing
after
the
competency
proceeding,
we
asked
for
a
trial
as
soon
as
possible.
so
putting
aside
whether
the
waiver
had
any
validity
at
all,
which
i'll
get
to
shortly,
the
waiver
had
no
effect
when
we
came
in
and
asked
for
a
trial.
otherwise,
defendants
would
have
no
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
have
several
responses
for
that.
the
court
only
made
a
finding
that
mr.
zedner
was
incompetent
on
march
21,
2001.
prior
to
that
time,
the
competency
issue
was
under
advisement.
it
couldn't
be
that
mr.
zedner's
incompetency,
if
it
existed
before
the
finding,
is
what
prevented
the
court
from
declaring
him
incompetent.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
your
honor
is...
is
exactly
right.
any
proceeding
under
section
3161(h)(1)(j)
is
excluded
but
only
for
30
days
once
it's
taken
under
advisement.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
that's
right,
your
honor.
yes.
on...
justice
breyer,
on
your
reading,
a...
a
court
could
sit
indefinitely
with
the
competency
proceeding
under
advisement.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
your
honor,
i'm...
i'm
just
trying
to
envision
what
that
remand
would
look
like.
if
the
court
were...
if
the...
if
the
case
were
to
go
back
to
the
second
circuit
and
then
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
finding
that
this
delay
resulted
from
mr.
zedner's
incompetency,
that
finding
would
be
clearly
erroneous.
there
is
no...
there
is
no
basis--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--that's
right,
your
honor,
and
the
act--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
no,
your
honor.
it...
it
says
that
the
court
has
decide
the
matter
within
30
days
or
the
clock
will
start
running.
now,
the
court,
in
a
particularly
difficult
or
novel
question,
could...
could
enter
an
order
of
ends
of
justice
exclusion
and
exclude
perhaps
an
additional
period
of
time.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
that
matter
would...
would
be
back
to
a...
a
situation
in
which
there
are
examinations
or
hearings
or
argument
or
post
hearing
brief,
and...
and
the
judge
can
take
as
long
as
the
judge
wants
there.
but
once
the
court
has
the
matter
under
advisement,
the
court
only
has
30
days.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
well,
not
quite,
your
honor.
the
question...
the
question
is
did
more
than
70
nonexcludable
days
elapse
during
this
period
or
not.
once
the
finding
was
made
in
march,
that's
when
mr.
zedner
was
incompetent.
no
further
findings
was
necessary...
were
necessary,
and
the
time
is
then
automatically
excluded.
the
time
prior
counts
toward
the
70-day
period
whether
or
not
he
was
in
some
metaphysical
sense
incompetent
before
then.
the
question
is
not
whether
he
could
have
been
tried
or
not
in
that
period.
the
question
is
did
more
than
70
days
elapse.
and
if
the
judge
had
decided
this
matter
sooner,
mr.
zedner
would
have
been...
received
the
treatment
he
ultimately
got
much
sooner,
and
the
trial
would
have
occurred
much
sooner.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
speedy
trial
act.
now,
the
government
has
abandoned
the
second
circuit's
holding
to
the
effect
that
harmless
error
analysis
applies
to
a
violation
of
the
70-day
limit.
that's
a
wise
position
for
the
government
take...
to
take,
given
this
court's
holding
in
bozeman
which
interpreted
essentially
the
same
language.
the
court
there
held
that
where
the
statute
says
the
indictment
shall
be
dismissed,
there's
no
room
for
harmless
error
analysis.
that's
the
remedy
that
congress
chose.
so
in
this
case
on
the...
on
the...
this
period
of
delay
we're
talking
about,
more
than
70
days
elapsed,
and
the
remedy
must
be
dismissal.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
that's
correct.
this
was...
this
was
a...
an
adjournment
that
was
requested
by
mr.
zedner's
first
lawyer
for
the
stated
purpose
of
investigating
whether
the
onited
states
bond,
supposedly
issued
by
the
ministry
of
finance
of
usa,
was
genuine.
the
court,
having
already
obtained
a
purported
waiver
of
a
speedy
trial
for
all
time,
granted
the
continuance,
but
made
no
order
of
excludable
delay,
as
it
had
done
previously,
made
no--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--it
could
take
for
all
time,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
close
question
as
to
whether
that
could
survive
appellate
review.
that
may
well
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
find,
after
having
let
the
matter...
delayed
the
matter
already
10
months,
to
grant
another
3
months
for
that
purpose.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
that
is
a
standard
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
generally
applied.
i
can't
recall
a
case
where
the
court
actually
reversed
an
ends
of
justice
finding.
there
may
well
be
one
based
on
a
legal
error
where
it
was
some
obvious
ground
that...
that
is
not
a
basis
for
an
adjournment
such
as--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
you're
right.
certainly
the
petitioner
and
his
counsel
at
the
time
requested
this
adjournment.
they
did
get
the
full
adjournment
they
requested,
but
the
judge
said
that
that
would
be
the
last
adjournment
and
that
the
matter
would
be
set
for
trial
then.
but
whether
that
time
is
excludable
or
not
is
answered
by
the
statute.
the
ends
of
justice
provision
recognizes
that
defendants
or
prosecutors
and
judges
on
their
own
motion
would
seek
or
grant
continuances,
but
that's
not
enough
under
the
statute.
the
statute
is...
although
it's
flexible,
is
rigorous.
the
court
must
make
a
finding
that
the
ends
of
justice
outweigh
the
public's
and
the
defendant's
interest
in
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
that's
right,
your
honor.
it's
not
harmless
for
the
same
reason
the
later
period
is
not
harmless
because
the
statute
says
that
if
the
defendant
is
not
brought
to
trial
within
the
time
limits,
the
indictment
shall
be
dismissed.
and
it
makes
very
clear
that
in
the
absence
of
an
ends
of
justice
finding,
the
time
is
not
excludable.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
justice
souter,
i
would...
i
would
not
characterize
this
as
a
clerical
error.
congress
considered
this
provision
the
heart
of...
of
a
scheme.
this
was
where--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--well,
i
would
disagree,
again
with
the
characterization
that
it's
just
a
failure
to
speak.
the
act
requires
a
careful
weighing
of
the
public's
interest,
the
ends
of
justice,
the
defendant's
interest.
so
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
speaking.
this
is--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--that's
right,
and
the
court
also
didn't
make
the
finding--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--or
state
the
reasons
that
the
statute
specifically
requires.
and
the
question
for
the
court
is
what
flows
from
that
failure.
and
the
answer
is
given
in
the
sanctions
provision.
it
says
that
if
more
than
70-nonexcluded
days
elapse,
the
indictment
shall
be
dismissed.
now,
that
provision
itself
builds
in
flexibility
to
take
into
account
exactly
what
your
honor
is
talking
about.
a
judge
may
dismiss
without
prejudice
to
reprosecution
depending
on
various
factors,
including
whether
it
was
just
an
oversight,
a
failure
to
recite
words.
so
that's
where--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--that's
where
this...
this
distinction
that
you're
drawing
can
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
principle...
well
accepted
principle
that
the
more
specific
provision
will
govern
over
the
general
governs
here.
so
the
remedy
provision,
the
sanctions
provision
here
says
that
the
indictment
shall
be
dismissed
whether
it's
71
days
that
elapsed
or
200
days
or
5
years.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
yes,
but
there's
not
always
a...
an
express
command
from
congress
as
to
what
the
remedy
should
be.
once
congress
says
the
indictment
shall
be
dismissed,
there's
no
room
for
a
court
to
say
that
the
indictment
shall
not
be
dismissed
unless
there's
some
harm
shown.
so
this
specific
provision
trumps
the
more
general
provisions
of
rule
52(a).
mr.
edward
scott
zas
well,
you
only--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--your
honor,
this...
the
only
place
you
will
find
the
words
here
are
the
transcript
of
the
status
conference
on
january
31,
1997.
that's
the
joint
appendix
beginning
at
page
80,
and
you
will
not
find
a
finding
regarding
the
ends
of
justice.
you
will
not
find
mention
of
the...
the
public
interest
or
any
of
the
other
balancing
factors
in
the
act--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--that's
correct.
this
judge
stopped
complying
with
the
act
on
november
8th,
1996
because
the
court
ruled
that
the
waiver
for
all
time
was
valid.
that
was
a...
an
injudicious
finding,
to
say
the
least.
5
minutes
worth
of
legal
research
would
have
shown
that
all
the
courts
of
appeals
at
the
time
had
already
held
that
the
waivers
were
invalid.
so
the
court
didn't
do
a
balancing,
didn't
think
it
was
doing
a
balancing.
the
court
has
a
colloquy
in
which
it
appropriately
expressed
skepticism
about
the
need
for
this
delay,
and
the
court
does,
in
effect,
what
congress
was
concerned
about.
it
indulged
defense
counsel
and
said,
well,
if
you
don't
care
enough,
i
don't
care
enough.
take
3
more
months.
that's
basically
what
happened.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
yes,
your
honor.
the...
the
government,
for
the
first
time,
here
in
this
court
has
unveiled
a
new
doctrine
that
hadn't
been
in
the
case
before.
it's
no
longer
relying
on
either
the
waiver
for
all
time
or
the
sort
of
mini
waiver
for
the...
the
january
delay.
but
it
argues
that
petitioner
is
estopped
from
challenging
the
90-day
delay
in
1997.
there
are
several
problems
with
the
government's
argument,
but
the
most
obvious
one
is
that
the
only
conduct
that
the
government
cites
to
trigger
the
estoppel
is
the
waiver.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
well,
your
honor,
i
can't
disagree
with
what
you've
said,
but...
but
the--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
yes.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
i
think...
i
think
there
are
two
different
waivers
that--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--that
are
before
the
court.
so,
justice
souter,
your
question
is
about
not
the
waiver
for
all
time,
but
the
more
limited
action
in
requesting
and
obtaining
the
continuance.
now,
ordinarily
without
a
statute
like
this,
the
defendant
getting
what
he
wants
would
amount
to
a
waiver
and
the
defendant
could
complain.
for
example,
an
evidentiary
ruling.
if...
if
the
defendant
wants
to
allow...
he
doesn't
object
to
evidence
coming
in,
that's
it.
he
can't
later
argue
that
it
should
not
have
come
in.
the
problem
here
is
that
the
statute...
that
congress
knew
that
this
kind
of
thing
would
happen.
defendants
would
want
delay.
defendants
would
be
quite
happy
to
put
off
their
trial
for
as
long
as
they
could.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
that's
right.
if
they're
out
in
the
community,
congress
wanted
those
people
to
be
tried.
and
so
the
ends
of
justice
provision
specifically
says
that
a
request
for
a
continuance
granted
by
the
court
is
not
enough
to
exclude
time.
there
has
to
be
both
a
finding
and
a
statement
of
reasons
in
the
record
to
support
the
finding
before
the
time
will
be
excluded.
justice
breyer--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--well,
it's...
it's
partially
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
well,
it's
not
correct
because
i
would...
i
would
disagree
with
the
characterization,
if
that's
what
your
honor
is
doing,
of...
of
anything
that
happened
here
as
being
sandbagging.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
yes.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
yes,
that...
that
is--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--well,
that...
that
is
what
the...
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
but
your
honor
shouldn't...
shouldn't
tarry
too
long
about
the
consequences
because
if
this
court
holds,
as
we
ask
the
court
to
hold,
that
waivers
are
no
good...
waivers
have
to
be
treated
essentially
as
a
request
for
a
continuance...
this
problem
goes
away.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
well,
your
honor,
the
alternative,
if
you
go
sort
of
the
government's
route
here,
is
to
essentially
perpetuate
the
confusion
that
brought
us
here
in
the
first
place.
the
government
essentially
argues,
well,
you
can't
waive,
but
sometimes
you
can
waive.
we're
not
quite...
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
exactly
when
you
can
waive.
that's
going
to
put
district
judges
in
a...
in
a
worse
position,
in
a
more
confused
position.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
that...
that's
right,
your
honor.
this
form
was...
was
preprinted
or
pretyped.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
and
as
we
point
out
in
the
reply
brief,
the
judge
had
taken
a
strong
legal
position
20
years
earlier
that
the
requirements
of
the
act
could
be
waived.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
i
think
president
ford
signed
it
on
january
3rd--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--yes,
yes.
yes,
and
you
know,
this
is
not
a
new
statute.
judges
are
used
to...
to
complying
with
it.
prosecutors
are
used
to
doing
it.
frankly,
i've
never
seen
a
waiver
for
all
time
before.
it's
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
will
happen
and
it
should
never
happen
again.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there...
there
is
a
circuit
split
on...
on
whether
you
can...
whether
a
court
can
grant
an
open
ended
continuance.
i
think
your...
your
honor's
ends
of
justice
continuance
would
amount
to
a
waiver
or
a
suspension
of
the
act.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
pick
up
on
questions
that
both
you
and
justice
scalia
asked
regarding
the...
the
language
of
the
statute.
one
of
the
court's
bedrock
principles
is
that
judges
are
not
free
to
rewrite
the
statute
that
congress
has
enacted.
this
statute
and
the
whole
statutory
scheme
here
speaks
very
clearly
and
very
precisely,
and
it
would
be
unwise,
even
if
permitted,
for
the
court
to
start
tinkering
with
it
because
the
whole
system
will
start
to
unravel
if
the...
if
the
requirement
of
express
findings
and
reasons
turns
into
a
could
have/would
have/should
have
contest,
in
which
case
trial
judges
will
take
the
act
less
seriously
knowing
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
make
the
findings
for
them.
and
it
will
make
the
court
of
appeals'
job
harder
because
they'll
be
guessing
after
the
fact
what
discretionary
decision
the
trial
judge
would
have
made.
this
statute...
the
ends
of
justice
provision
is
very
clear.
the
government
has
cited
no
ambiguity,
and
it
controls.
because
the
findings
were
not
made,
whether
they
could
have
been
made
or
should
have
been
made
or
would
have
been
made,
they
weren't
made,
and
therefore,
the
time
ran
and
dismissal
is
required.
now,
the
government
proceeds
under
the
false
assumption
that
but
for
the
waiver,
the
judge
would
have
granted
this
continuance
on
january
31,
1997.
there's
absolutely
no
support
for
that
in
the
record.
even
before
this
occasion,
on
november
8th,
1996,
which
was
the
prior
court
appearance,
the
court
said
you're
not
getting
another
adjournment
unless
you
waive
for
all
time.
so
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
at
this
later
date
the
court
was
about
to
say,
well,
forget
the
waiver,
okay,
i'll
give
you
3
months.
it's...
it's
the
waiver
that
is
providing
the
basis
for
the
exclusion.
the
judge,
if
pushed,
would
have
said,
no,
we're
going
to
trial
soon.
no
waiver,
no
more
time.
so
it's
a
false
assumption.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
second
period
again.
the
government
again
assumes
that
when
the
judge
found
mr.
zedner
incompetent
in
march
of
2001,
that
that
is
a
retroactive
determination
that
he
was
incompetent
from
july,
august,
september,
october,
november,
et
cetera.
and
as
the
court
is
aware--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--well,
the...
the
finding
is
effective
from
that
point
forward.
that
has
to
be
the
case
because,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it's
important
for
the
parties
to
know,
as
matters
are
unfolding,
what
the
speedy
trial
clock
is.
that
way
the
government
knows
to
push
the
cases
that
are
approaching
the
70-day
limit
to
trial.
people
can't
know
that
answer
if
everyone
is
waiting
to
find
out
what
the
outcome
of
a
pending
motion
is.
and
the
defendant,
in
fact,
couldn't
move
for
dismissal
under
the
act
until
the...
the
judge
said
after
1
or
2
years,
i
find
the
defendant
incompetent.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
no,
your
honor.
if
the
judge
had
said,
i
knew
this
all
along
back
when
i
heard
the
evidence
that
this
defendant
was
incompetent,
that
would
be
an
even
more
egregious
violation.
the
court
is
not
supposed
to
sit
and
just
let
the
defendant
sit
out
on
the
streets
for
month
after
month
after
month
when...
when
the
defendant
is
incompetent.
the
court
is
supposed
to
make
a...
a
prompt
finding.
mr.
edward
scott
zas
well,
the
court
said...
the
act
says
it
in...
in
section
(h)(1)(j).
that's
the...
the...
in
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief
on
page
5.
the
act
excludes
time
while
the
proceeding
is...
is
going
on
for
examinations
and
hearings,
et
cetera,
but
at
the
end,
it
excludes
only
delay
reasonably
attributable
to
any
period
not
to
exceed
30
days
during
which
any
proceeding
concerning
the
defendant
is
actually
under
advisement
by
the
court.
so...
so
if
the--
mr.
edward
scott
zas
--if
i
may
answer
the
question,
your
honor.
well,
the
only
finding
that
the
court
has
to
make
under
(b)(4)
is
that
the
defendant
is
incompetent.
that
automatically
will
exclude
the
time
going
forward
until
the
defendant
is
restored
to
competency.
