justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
merits,
i
think
that
their
claim
is...
take
company
a
and
company
b.
both
are
located
in
toledo,
both
hire
a
certain
number
of
people,
have
a
certain
payroll,
have
a
certain
amount
of
property,
and
have
a
certain
amount
of
business.
identical.
and
they're
charged
a
tax.
and
now,
what...
company
b,
when
it's
thinking
of
building
a
new
plant
or
make
new
investment
in
machinery,
if
it
goes
to
wisconsin,
it
will
discover
it
pays
less
taxes
on
all
those
things
that
were
already
in
ohio.
and,
therefore,
the
people
who
sell
land
or
machinery
in
wisconsin
are
discovering
it
isn't
being
bought,
because
that
old
tax,
which
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
new
investment,
is
now
less
because
of
the
new
investment.
so,
that
hurts
businesses
in
wisconsin.
as
i
understand
it,
that's
their
claim.
and
if
i've
got
it
wrong,
i'm
sure
you'll
correct
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
i'm
probably
wrong.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
that...
that
is
true,
and
then
the
effect
of
that
is
that
firms
that
now
do
business
in
ohio
won't
build
their
new
facility
in
wisconsin,
because
they
like
the
lower
tax
bill
in
ohio.
and
that
hurts
businesses
and
others
in
wisconsin.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
were
saying
they
have
no
harm?
i
think
they're
pointing
to
that
harm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
the
harm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
think...
well,
they
can
tell
me.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
found
any
other
instance
in
which...
any
case...
there
was
a
absolute
lack
of
standing,
prudential
standing,
but
the
court
waived
that,
because
it
was
prudential
and
not
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--dog
license...
dog
license
costs
$10,
but
you
have
to
pay
20
if
you
invest
next
time
in
wisconsin.
[laughter]
by
the
way,
we're
not
going
to
do
it
that
way,
we're
just
going
to
say
you
pay
half.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
but,
you
see...
but
my
point
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--separate
tax
in
ohio,
and
we're
going
to
double
it,
though,
if
your
next
investment
is
in
some--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--other
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
now,
all
we
do
is,
we
say,
"we're
not
going
to
double
it.
"
"you're
going
to
pay
the
same.
"
"but
everybody
invests
here,
pays
half.
"
