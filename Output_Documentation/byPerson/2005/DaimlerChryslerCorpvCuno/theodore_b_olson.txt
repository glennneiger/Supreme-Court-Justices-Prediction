mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
respondents
dispute
the
wisdom,
efficacy,
and
constitutionality
of
ohio's
franchise
tax
system,
but
they
face
two
insurmountable
obstacles
in
this
court.
first,
they
cannot
demonstrate
any
actual,
concrete,
and
direct
injury
as
a
result
of
ohio's
investment
tax
credit
to
satisfy
the
irreducible
minimum
requirement
for
standing
in
this
court.
secondly,
the
facial
dormant
commerce
clause
challenge
that
they
bring
is
without
merit.
ohio
imposes
no
burdens
or
tariffs
on
interstate
commerce.
its
investment
incentive
program
is
available
on
equal
terms
to
in
state,
out
of
state,
local,
or
interstate
businesses.
it
is
nondiscriminatory,
and
it
stimulates,
rather
than
impedes,
commerce.
respondents
are
not
injured
when
a
business
with
which
they
do
not
compete
receives
a
reduction
in
their
taxes
as
a
result
of
a
tax
credit.
respondents
pay
no
higher
taxes
for
products.
they
suffer
no
coercion
because
of
a
tax
credit
that
is
given
to
others.
their
tax
burden
is
not
increased
by
ohio's
investment
tax
credit,
nor
will
it
be
lessened
if
it
is
eliminated.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
not
sure,
justice
ginsburg.
in
some
of
this
court's
dormant
commerce
clause
cases,
competitors,
who
are
arguably
injured
because
they
are
paying
a
higher
tax
against
the...
compared
to
the
company
that's
receiving
the
benefit...
in
a
couple
of
cases,
this
court
has
recognized
customers
of
companies
that
are
paying
higher
products,
and,
therefore,
potentially
higher
prices,
for
the
products
that
they
purchase.
and,
in
one
or
two
cases,
states
have
been
recognized
for
purposes
of
standing.
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
we
don't
think
that
at
all.
as
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what...
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
strongest
statement
is
in
the
valley
forge
case,
at
page
489,
where
the
court
said,
"if
respondents
have
no...
the
argument
that
if
respondents
have
no
standing
to
sue,
no
one
would
have
standing,
is
not
a
reason
to
find
standing.
"
this
would
convert
"standing"
into
a
requirement
that
must
observed
only
when
satisfied.
but
the
fact
is
that
under
any
standard
articulated
by
this
court
in
its
article
iii
cases,
the
respondents
here
do
not
have
standing.
the
effect
of
the
tax
is
very
"uncertain,
hypothetical,
or
speculative.
"
to
use
the
words
of
this
court,
with
respect
to
them.
they
cannot
demonstrate
that
they
are
affected
by
it.
and
as--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
nonetheless,
the
court
made
that
distinction
in
the
flast
case
with
respect
to
the
establishment
clause,
and,
specifically,
the
spending
and
taxing
powers
exercised
by
congress.
and
the
court
determined,
in
that
case,
that
the
establishment
clause
was
a
specific
limitation
on
spending
authority.
the
court
has
been
very
careful,
and
many
justices
of
this
court,
individually,
have
said
that
that
distinction
in
that
case
will
not
be
extended
beyond
the
establishment
clause,
in
the
context
of
spending,
in
connection
with
a
religious
conviction,
or
the
establishment
of
a
religion.
the
court
has
indicated,
frequently,
i
think,
that
that
is
not
going
to
be
extended.
at
any
rate,
it
wouldn't
be
extended...
the
logic
of
flast
wouldn't
be
applicable
here
anyway.
this
is
not
an
application
of
the
spending
power
by
congress
or
the
taxing
power
by
congress.
this
is
the
commerce
clause,
which
is
a
permissive
grant
of
authority
to
congress,
and,
at
most,
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
a
limitation
on
the
states.
these
respondents
are
not
remotely
close
to
what
this
court
has
said
are
the
irreducible
minimums.
even
if
they--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
believed,
at
the
time,
that
there
was
standing
with
respect
to
the
property
taxes...
the
municipal
taxpayers,
with
respect
to
the
property
taxes.
that
was
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--basis
for
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
court
has
never
treated
article
iii
standing
that
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
has
said,
"a
standing
is
not
dispensed
in
gross.
"
--that
was
the
lewis
versus
casey
case...
that
standing
has
to
looked
at...
be
looked
at
individually
with
respect
to
the
claim.
furthermore,
this...
there
was
not
an
identical
nucleus
of
facts.
i
mean,
it
is
a...
the
property
tax
exemption
was
issued
pursuant
to
a
contract
between
the
company
here,
daimlerchrysler,
and
the
city
of
toledo.
the
state
tax--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
did
not,
and
do
not.
now,
i...
there
may
be
arguments
that
might
be
made,
that
are
not
before
this
court,
with
respect
to
the
whole
idea
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
with
respect
to
the
municipal
taxpayers
and
the...
and
whether
there
would
be
standing
to
challenge
the
property
tax
exemption.
that's
not
an
issue
that
has
been
briefed
here.
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
but
that
would
require
a
rather
significant
change
in
the
court's
article
iii
standing
jurisprudence.
it
would,
furthermore,
allow
the
tail
to
wag
the
dog,
the
exception
to
swallow
the
rule.
if
anybody
could
bring
any
kind
of
a
case
at
all,
then
all
manner
of
cases
of...
with...
for
which
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
at
all
could
be
along
with
them.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
the...
there's
a
separate
entity,
called
kim's
auto.
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
entity
no
longer
has
standing.
there
are
still
property
taxpayers,
but
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
cause--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
absolutely
correct.
but
the
chief
justice
was
asking
me
about
the
municipal
property
taxpayers
with
respect
to
the
claim
concerning
the
property
tax
exemption.
those
plaintiffs...
respondents
are
still
in
the
case.
that's
not
kim's
auto.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
there
are...
there
are
still
property
tax...
some
of
the
respondents
that
are
still
in
the
case
are
property
taxpayers.
kim's
auto--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--wasn't
the
only
one.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
with
respect
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
fairness,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
there
are
other
respondents
who
claim
to
be
property
taxpayers
in
the
city
of
toledo,
aside
from
kim's
auto.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
they
are...
they
are
complaining
about
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--property
tax--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
we're
saying...
we...
the
property...
under
this
court's
jurisprudence,
municipal
taxpayers
have
been
permitted,
under
some
circumstances,
to
challenge
municipal
actions,
irrespective
of
the
imminent
domain
proceeding.
so,
there
is
that
separate
issue
that's
in
the
case.
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
spend
a
moment
or
two
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
because
it
is
a
very
important
issue.
nearly
every
state
in
the
united
states
has
some
sort
of
incentive
program.
this...
with
respect
to
the
location
of
businesses
or
the
drawing
of
businesses
within
the
state,
which
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
we
believe
that
the
case
was
properly
removed,
and,
therefore,
there's
not
counsel
fees
with
respect
to
the
removal
statute;
that
the
proper
resolution
would
be
to
vacate
the
sixth
circuit
decision
and
then
remand
to
the
district
court
for
a
dismissal
because
of
lack
of
standing,
or
the
court...
this
court
hasn't
resolved
whether
it
would
be
a
dismissal
or
a
remand
to
the...
to
the
state
court.
we
don't
believe
that
there
would
be
standing
under
state
court
taxpayer
or
state...
ohio
jurisprudence,
either.
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
article
iii
standing
that
we're
talking
about,
not
prudential
considerations
of
standing,
as
the
court
made
very
clear
in
valley
forge,
where
a
taxpayer
seeks
to
employ
a
federal
court
to
air
grievances
about
the
conduct
of
government
or
the
allocation
of
power
in
the
federal
system.
the
iii
is
not
met.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
municipal
taxpayer
standing,
the
court
would
have
to
determine
that
that
did
exist,
something
that
has
not
happened
before,
and
then
would
piggyback
onto
that
claim
a
challenge
to
a
separate
tax
by
a
separate
government
under
a
separate
claim
arising
out
of
a
separate
transaction.
the
deal
between
daimlerchrysler
and
toledo
was
separate
from
the
tax
granted
by
the
investment
tax
credit
under
the
state's
system.
respondents
state,
in
the
first
page
of
their
brief,
that,
because
all
of
these
states
do
these
things,
these
investment
tax
credits
have
only
minimal
effect
on
business
transactions.
that's
the
first
page
of
their
brief.
that's
harmful
to
their
standing,
that's
harmful
to
their
commerce
clause
challenge.
ohio
only
taxes
in
activity.
it
uses
a
constitutionally
appropriate
apportionment
formula
to
determine
how
much
of
the
interstate
business's
activity
is
attributable
to
ohio,
and
only
taxes
that.
so
that
if
there
is
a
benefit
given
because
someone
comes
to
the
state
and
builds
a
plant
there,
it
may
result,
actually,
in
increased
taxes
in
ohio,
because
the
plant
will
raise
the
proportion
of
business
being
done
in
ohio.
but
what
ohio
does
not
do
is...
what
this
court
has
held
unconstitutional...
is,
tax
the
out
of
state
activity,
or
burden
the
out
of
state
activity,
or
make
interstate
commerce
itself
more
burdensome.
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
questions,
justices
have
pointed
out
in
questions,
this
same
issue
could
be
raised
with
respect
to
the
state
of
nevada.
there's
no
franchise
tax
in
the
state
of
nevada,
and
same
with
other
states.
some
states
offer
accelerated
permitting
requirements
or
relaxed
environmental
rules
or
different
educate...
employment
standards,
all
matters
of
state
regulation.
this
court
has
said
that
competition
between
states
for
commerce
lies
at
the
heart
of
a
free
trade
society.
that
is
what's
going
on
here.
states
are
competing
with
appropriate
permissive
incentives
to
do
business
within
the
state.
this
is,
as
this
court
said,
a
laudable
purpose
for
state
activity.
what
the
respondents
would
do
would
nationalize
state
tax
systems.
you
couldn't
have
a
more
beneficial
tax
system
in
massachusetts
than
in
ohio,
because
that
would
provide
some
sort
of
a
burden,
under
the
respondent's
theory.
the
same
with
other
regulations
by
states
of
business.
we
would
have
a
system
where
this
court
would
be
deciding...
all
states
would
have
to
have
uniform
taxation,
uniform
systems
of
regulations,
the
very
antithesis
of
federalism.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
now,
what
i
would--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
you
have
your
dog
in
wisconsin,
you
may
pay
whatever--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--wisconsin--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
would
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
would
be
something
this
court
would
be
severely
concerned
with.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
again,
that's...
and
i
think
that
goes
to
justice
souter's
point,
that
there's
a
relationship
between
the
tax
system
and
the
investment.
we
should
end
on
the
point
that
every...
virtually
every
state
has
this
kind
of
system,
not
just
because
of
competition
with
states,
but
to
find
the
right
location,
a
depressed
area
within
a
state.
and
this
is
important
with
respect
to
businesses
in
the
united
states
competing
with
foreign
countries.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
don't
believe
that
the
dormant
commerce
clause
stands
the...
stands
for
the
proposition
that
these
regulations
should
be
nationalized.
