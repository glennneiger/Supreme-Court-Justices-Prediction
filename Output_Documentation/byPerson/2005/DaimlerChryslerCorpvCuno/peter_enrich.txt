mr.
peter
enrich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
question
of
standing,
and
then
turn
to
the
commerce
clause
merits.
let
me
begin
at
the
point
where
petitioners
and
respondents
agree
on
the
question
of
standing.
the
original
lawsuit
brought
by
respondents
in
the
ohio
state
court
raised
two
claims,
one
challenging
the
investment
tax
credit
that's
before
this
court
today,
the
other
challenging
the
property
tax
exemption.
the
point
on
which
petitioners
and
respondents
agree
is
that
respondents
do
have
standing,
in
their
status
as
municipal
taxpayers,
to
bring
their
challenge
to
the
property
tax
exemption.
and,
indeed,
the
district
court
agreed
and
found
that
there
was
standing,
in
the
district
court's
judgment,
to
reach
both
parts
of
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
respondents'
municipal
taxpayer
standing.
mr.
peter
enrich
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
two
reasons
why
we
believe
that
there
is
such
a
basis.
first,
there
are
cases...
one
case
in
this
court,
in
flast
v.
cohen,
where
the
court
has
found
that
standing
to
raise
one
claim
extended,
as
well,
to
raise,
in
that
case,
a
free
exercise
claim.
there
are
a
number
of
such
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
wright
and
miller
has
recognized
a
concept
of
what
they
refer
to
as
"ancillary
standing"
on
that
basis.
but
the
second
point
that
we
think
is
perhaps
more
important
is,
once
there
is
one
claim
in
the
case
that
satisfies
the
article
iii
"case
and
controversy"
requirement,
then
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
here.
the
question
that
then
faces
this
court
is,
how
far
should
it
reach
in
addressing
the
other
claims
which
are
part
of
that
very
same
case
or
controversy?
mr.
peter
enrich
that
is
true,
your
honor.
and
in
at
least
some
of
the
circuit
court
cases,
they
have
reached
a
second
claim
where
the...
where
a
different
part
of
the
same
transaction
was
being
attacked.
the
sierra
club
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
is
one
good
example
of
that.
in
the
present
case,
the
two
issues
that
we
challenge
both
arise
out
of
the
very
same
transaction,
out
of
a
deal
that
was
entered
into
between
the
city
of
toledo
and
daimlerchrysler--
mr.
peter
enrich
--no,
this
court
has
not
ever
had
to
address
the
question
of
municipal
taxpayer
standing,
except
in
establishment
clause
contexts.
mr.
peter
enrich
mr.
chief
justice,
you
would
at
least
have
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
municipal
taxpayer
standing
was...
satisfied
the
article
iii
requirements
under
your
standing
doctrines.
if
you
found
that
it
satisfied
the
article
iii
requirements,
then
that
would
suffice
to
bring
this
case
or
controversy
past
the
article
iii
threshold--
mr.
peter
enrich
--bring
us
to
prudential
threshold.
mr.
peter
enrich
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
we
would
suggest
that,
in
keeping
with
the
consistent
holdings
of
every
circuit
court
that
has
addressed
this
topic,
it
would
make
sense
for
this
court
to
acknowledge
municipal
taxpayer
standing,
or,
at
the
very
least,
to
acknowledge
that
the
obstacles,
any
obstacles
to
municipal
taxpayer
standing,
are
prudential
obstacles,
rather
than
article
iii
obstacles.
there
are
actually
other
reasons
why
we
believe
the
article
iii
barrier
is
crossed.
we
believe
that
this
case...
that,
as
judge
posner
wrote
in
a
recent
opinion
that
we
referenced
in
a
letter
to
the
court...
it
came
out
after
our
brief
was
filed...
in
his
analysis
of
the
taxpayer
standing
cases,
he
concluded
that
the
court's
burden
on
taxpayer
standing
was
based
on
prudential,
not
on
constitutional
grounds.
we
believe
his
analysis
is
correct.
once
this
becomes
a
question
of
the
prudential
standards,
we
believe
that
the
very
particular
factual
history
of
this
case
provides
ample
reason
for
the
court
to
find
that
there
should
be
standing
in
this
particular
case
to
reach
the
investment
tax
credit
claim.
respondents
brought
this
case
in
the
ohio
state
courts
largely
out
of
a
recognition
that
the
standards
for
standing
were
different
in
the
state
and
federal
courts
in
this
area.
in
fact,
if
petitioners
felt
that
we
didn't
have
standing
in
ohio,
perhaps
the
wisest
strategy
for
them
would
have
been
to
oppose
standing
there.
but,
instead,
they
chose
to
remove
the
case
to
the
federal
court.
and
there,
we
requested
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
state
courts,
because
we
identified
to
the
district
court
the
risk,
that
if
the
federal
court
kept
the
case,
we
might
find
ourselves,
years
later,
before
a
higher
court
that
might
say,
"but
you
don't
have
standing",
and
require
us
to
go
back
and
begin
all
over
in
the
state
courts.
petitioners,
at
that
time,
argued
that,
in
fact,
we
did
have
standing.
and
the
district
court
so
held.
and
then
petitioners
have
not
again
raised
the
question
of
standing
until
before
this
court.
mr.
peter
enrich
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
peter
enrich
in
craig
v.
boren,
this
is
exactly
what
the...
this
court
did.
there,
the
one
plaintiff
who
provided
standing
for
a
sex
discrimination
claim
no
longer
had
standing
by
the
time
the
case
was
adjudicated.
the
plaintiff
who
ultimately
had
standing
to
keep
the
case
going
was
one
who,
although
she
suffered
an
actual
injury,
was
not...
was
asserting
third
party
rights,
and
so,
did
not
satisfy
prudential
standing
requirements.
mr.
peter
enrich
i
actually--
mr.
peter
enrich
--don't
believe
that--
mr.
peter
enrich
--they
did
use
that
concept
in
craig.
i
think
that's
a
concept
that
has
come
into
this
court's
jurisprudence
more
frequently
in
later
days--
mr.
peter
enrich
--justice
ginsburg,
the
premise
behind
our
argument
is
that
the
article
iii
hurdle
is
cleared
on
other
grounds,
on
grounds
that
i've
already
discussed
and
we
can
certainly
reiterate.
the
question
then
becomes...
on
prudential
grounds.
and
that
is
the
issue
that
was
presented
in
craig,
that
she
had
a
direct
injury,
but
she
was
in...
she
did
not
satisfy
the
prudential
standards
because
she
was
asserting
third
party
rights.
and
what
this
court
there
held
was,
because
the
parties
had
adjudicated
the
issue
below
without
objecting
about
standing,
that
the
court
would
proceed
to
the
merits.
mr.
peter
enrich
yes,
your
honor,
that...
and,
similarly,
we
believe
that
there
was
standing,
and
still
is
standing,
for
the
plaintiffs
to
be
in
this
court
on
article
iii
grounds
because
of
the
continuing
pendency
of
our
challenge
to
the
property
tax
exemption
as
municipal
taxpayers.
we--
mr.
peter
enrich
--no,
justice
scalia,
in
a
footnote
in
flast,
the
court
specifically
says,
"having
now
decided
that
there's
establishment
clause
standing,
we
can
also
reach
the
free
exercise
question
without
discussing
whether
there
would
be--
"
mr.
peter
enrich
--"#
independent
standing"--
mr.
peter
enrich
--"#
for
that"--
mr.
peter
enrich
--it
is,
indeed,
your
honor.
we
acknowledge
that,
although,
again,
as
i
say,
in
some
of
the
lower
court
cases
there
have
been
challenges
where
the
claim
that
the
plaintiffs
did
not
have
standing
with
regard
to
was
challenging
a
different
outcome
in
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence.
the
specific
example
was
a
challenge
to
an
environmental
impact
statement,
where
the
plaintiffs
had
standing
to
challenge
certain
elements,
but
did
not
have
standing
to
challenge
the
potential...
the
failure
of
this
impact
statement
to
consider
impacts
on
indigenous
tribes.
and
the
district...
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that
they
did
have
standing,
based
on
their
other
standing
claims,
to
reach
that
claim,
as
well.
if
i
can
turn,
your
honors,
to
the
merits,
if
ohio
were
to
impose
an
income
tax
on
those
corporations
which
did
their
manufacturing
outside
of
the
state
of
ohio,
but
not
to
impose
that
tax
on
those
businesses
which
did
their
manufacturing
inside
of
ohio,
there's
no
question
that
such
attacks
would
violate
the
commerce
clause
by
facially
discriminating
in
favor
of
in
state
business
activity.
it
would
be
a
tariff,
by
any
other
name.
mr.
peter
enrich
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
any
tax
measure
gives
an...
which
encourages
businesses
to
locate
in
the
jurisdiction,
poses
a
commerce
clause
problem.
a
commerce
clause--
mr.
peter
enrich
--problem--
mr.
peter
enrich
--a
commerce
clause
problem,
your
honor,
is
posed
only
when
the
provision
provides
a
benefit
which
is
specifically
distinguished
and
provided
to
in
state
activity
but
not
provided--
mr.
peter
enrich
--to
out
of
state--
mr.
peter
enrich
--activity.
mr.
peter
enrich
but,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
the
only
ones
who
are
getting
the
lower
effective
tax
rate
are
those
who
locate
their
manufacturing
activity
in
the
state.
mr.
peter
enrich
they--
mr.
peter
enrich
--well,
i'm...
in
the
case
of
a
lower
income
tax
rate,
your
honor...
it's
a
different
situation
for
the
lower
property
tax
rate,
but
take
the
lower
income
tax
rate
first...
the
lower
income
tax
rate
will
reduce
the
tax
burden
on
all
businesses,
wherever
their
manufacturing
capacity
is
located,
who
have
a
taxable
business
presence
in
ohio.
there
is
no
discrimination
based
on
where
they
locate
any
activity.
if
they
locate
new
activity
in
ohio,
more
of
their
income
will
be
subjected
to
that
lower
rate
of
tax,
but
that
is
not
discriminating
between
two
businesses,
based
on
where
they
locate
their
activity.
mr.
peter
enrich
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
the
way
that
corporate
income
taxes
work,
they
look
at
a
tax...
an
apportioned
share
of
the
worldwide
income
of
the
business.
mr.
peter
enrich
yes.
if
you're
not
doing
business
in
the
state,
then
you
will
not
pay
any
tax.
mr.
peter
enrich
if--
mr.
peter
enrich
--well,
your
honor,
a
business
that
doesn't
have
a
business
presence
in
the
state
of
ohio
will
not
pay
any
ohio
tax.
it
is
not
subject
to
any
burden.
it
is
not
discriminated
against
in
any
way.
that's
the
same
situation
for
the
property
tax.
mr.
peter
enrich
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
peter
enrich
--discrimination--
mr.
peter
enrich
--yes,
your
honor.
the
discrimination
here
is
not
between
those
businesses
which
are
not
present
at
all
in
ohio
and
those
which
are
doing
their
manufacturing
in
ohio,
the
discrimination
is
between
those
who
are
doing
business
in
ohio,
but
not
locating
their
new
manufacturing
activity
in
ohio,
and
those
who
do
business
in
ohio,
but
do
locate
their
new
manufacturing
activity.
this
is
the
same
situation
that
the
court
has
confronted
over
and
over
again.
in
boston
stock,
the
discrimination
only
affected
those
purchasers
or
sellers
of
stock
where
the
transactions
had
sufficient
nexus
with
new
york
to
be
subject
to
new
york's
tax.
the
problem
was
that,
of
that
universe
of
transactions,
the
ones
where
the
sale
was
made
on
a
new
york
exchange
were
subjected
to
a
lower
rate
of
tax
than
the
ones
that
were
transacted
on
an
out
of
state
exchange.
mr.
peter
enrich
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
disclose
what
the
political
context
was
in
ohio
at
the
time
that--
mr.
peter
enrich
--that
this
was
enacted.
mr.
peter
enrich
justice
scalia,
our
objection--
mr.
peter
enrich
--our
objection
is
that
when
states
use
discriminatory
tax
measures
as
a
way
to
provide
tax
benefits
to
those
businesses
that
locate
in
the
jurisdiction,
that
it
leads
to
a
competition
between
the
states
that
ends
up
hurting
taxpayers,
like
respondents
here,
by
reducing
the
ability
of
the
states
to
generate
tax
revenues
from
business.
mr.
peter
enrich
this
court
has--
mr.
peter
enrich
--your
honor--
mr.
peter
enrich
--your
honor,
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
exactly
the
situation
in
many
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
previously
struck
down
as
facially
discriminatory
tax
provisions.
in
bacchus
imports,
anyone
could
move
to
hawaii
and
produce
pineapple
wine
and
receive
the
benefit
of
the
tax
exemption.
in
boston
stock,
anyone
could
make
their
transactions
on
the
new
york
exchanges,
rather
than
an
out
of
state
exchange,
and
get
the
benefit
of
the
lower
rate.
what
this
court
has
consistently
said
is,
when
the
benefit
that
is
given
is...
takes
the
form
of
a
credit,
an
exemption,
a
reduction
in
a
tax
which
applies
to
out
of
state
businesses,
transactions,
and
activities,
that
that
constitutes
the
kind
of
discrimination--
mr.
peter
enrich
--that
the
commerce
clause
forbids.
mr.
peter
enrich
yes.
and--
mr.
peter
enrich
--yes,
your
honor,
there
is
a
very
precise
parallel
here.
the
corporate
income
tax
imposed
by
ohio
applies
to
any
business
that
transacts
business
in
ohio,
whether
or
not
it
has
manufacturing
presence.
mr.
peter
enrich
yes.
mr.
peter
enrich
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
as
this
court
has
suggested,
as
far
back
as
hughes
v.
alexandria
scrap,
when
the
state
is
essentially
acting
as
a
participant
in
the
market,
deploying
its
own
resources--
mr.
peter
enrich
--well,
in
terms
of
its
economic
effect,
it
would,
your
honor,
but
this
court,
in
cases
like
camps
newfoundland,
has
recognized
a
significant
distinction
between
cash
subsidies,
on
the
one
hand,
and
tax
benefits,
on
the
other,
largely
because
the
tax
that
is
reduced
is
a
tax
which
does
involve
an
exercise
of
what
this
court
has
called
"a
primeval
governmental
activity",
and
constitutes
a
kind
of
regulation
which
brings
it
within
the
scope
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause;
whereas,
in...
ordinarily,
a
direct
subsidy
paid
out
of
the
general
funds
of
the
state
does
not
involve
any
such
regulatory
impact
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
peter
enrich
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there's
a
wide,
wide
continuum.
at
the
one
end,
there
is
the
standard...
the
pure
tariff.
on
the
other
end,
there
is
providing
training
for
workers
or
infrastructure
for
a
plant.
this
court
has
clearly
recognized
that
tariffs
are
unconstitutional.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
providing
training
or
infrastructure
would
be.
all
of
those
have
the
same
economic
effect.
mr.
peter
enrich
yes.
mr.
peter
enrich
that--
mr.
peter
enrich
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
peter
enrich
--what
we're
suggesting
is
that
a
measure
which
has
the
identical
effect,
and
is
structured
very
much
like
a
provision
which
applies
a
tax
to
those
businesses
who
engage
in
out
of
state
activity,
while
excusing
from
tax
those
businesses
that
engage
in
in
state
activity,
is
a
tariff,
by
another
name.
and
this
provision,
as--
mr.
peter
enrich
--yes,
your
honor.
and,
in
that
respect,
this
is
no
different
than,
for
instance,
the
westinghouse
electric
case,
which
granted...
which
struck
down
a
grant
of
a
credit
against
a
corporate
income
tax
that
was
available
to
any
business
that
chose
to
locate
some
of
its
export
activity
in
the
state
of
new
york.
again--
mr.
peter
enrich
--it
was--
mr.
peter
enrich
--it
was
exactly--
mr.
peter
enrich
--the
same
tax
as
the
tax
in
question
here,
your
honor.
it
was
a
corporate
income
tax
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
the
ordinary
three
factors
that
ohio
uses,
on
the
basis
of
where
the
company's
sales
are
located,
where
the
company's
payroll
is
located,
where
the
company's
property
is
located.
the
two
taxes,
in
westinghouse
and
here,
were
identical.
there
were
some
small
differences
in
exactly
the
way
that
the
credit
was
structured,
but
the
underlying
taxes
were,
in
all
respects,
identical.
the
problem
that
the
court
recognized
in
westinghouse
is
that
by
giving
a
credit
that
was
restricted
to
a
particular
kind
of
in
state
activity,
and
not
to
its
out
of
state
counterpart,
the
state
was
effectively
providing
a
benefit
to
in
state
business
and
a
burden
on
out
of
state
business
that
constituted
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
tariff,
and
the
court
struck
it
down.
now--
mr.
peter
enrich
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
they
would
be.
again,
a
homesteader
who
buys
a
property
in
another
state
is
not
going
to
owe
any
tax
to--
mr.
peter
enrich
--ohio.
mr.
peter
enrich
but--
mr.
peter
enrich
--your
honor,
we
would
suggest
that
the
question
is
whether
the
tax
scheme
in
question
in
the
state
whose
provision
is
being
challenged
imposes
differential
burdens
on
two
different
entities
based
on
where
they
locate
some
activity.
in
the
case
of
the
homestead
exemption,
the
state
offering
the
homestead
exemption
is
not
saying,
"we'll
tax
you
if
you
locate
outside
the
state.
"
perhaps
some
other
state
is
taxing
them.
but,
again,
this
court
has
repeatedly
avoided
judging
the
legitimacy
of
one
state's
tax
by
the
question
of
what
other
states
did.
mr.
peter
enrich
your
honor,
maybe
i'm
not
understanding
your
example.
are
you
imagining
that
the
state
that's
offering
the
homestead
exemption
was
imposing
a
tax
on
the
property
located
outside
the
state?
mr.
peter
enrich
okay.
so,
that
is
a
provision
that,
i
think,
does
raise
at
least--
mr.
peter
enrich
--some
questions.
it's
one
where
i
think
there
are
strong
justifications
outside
of
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce
that
very
well
might
provide
ample
justification
for
it.
it
raises...
and
the
question
on
which
we
have
asked
this
court
to
grant
cert
about
the
property
tax
exemption
raises
precisely
the
question
of
what
sorts
of
conditions
on
a
property
tax
exemption
do,
and
what
sorts
do
not,
constitute
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
i
would
suggest
that
there
would
be
ample
opportunity
to
distinguish
something
like
the
homestead
provision,
which
is
directed
at
a
quite
different
purpose
than
encouraging
in
state
economic
activity
from--
mr.
peter
enrich
--i
would
suggest
that
the
commerce
clause
is
much
more
concerned
with
efforts
to
relocate
businesses
than
with
efforts
to
protect
individuals
from
burdens
of
local
property
taxation.
mr.
peter
enrich
that
is
true,
your
honor.
we
would
suggest
that
that
raises
a
very
different
set
of
questions
from
the
facially
discriminatory
distinction
between
out
of
state
businesses
who
are
subjected
to
the
tax,
in
the
case
of
the
ohio
investment
tax
credit,
and
in
state
businesses,
which
are
excused
from
paying
that
same
tax,
which
is,
again,
exactly
what
a
tariff
does,
your
honor.
