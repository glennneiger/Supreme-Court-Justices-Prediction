mr.
douglas
r.
cole
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
they
have
standing
in
state
court,
either.
ohio
has
a
taxpayer
standing
doctrine
much
like
the
federal
taxpayer
standing
doctrine.
they
would
need
to
show
some
unique
harm
separable
to
them.
i
believe
the
language
is
that
they
would
have
to
show
that
they
contribute
to
a
special
fund.
and
that's
out
of
a
case
called
masterson,
in
ohio.
there
is
a
separate
sheward
case
that
the
respondents
cite
in,
i
believe,
footnote
5
of
their
brief.
we
don't
believe
that
this
falls
within
the
sheward
exception
to
standing,
in
ohio.
there's
a
certain
exception
that
allows
certain
cases
of
great
public
importance
to
go
directly
to
the
supreme
court,
but
we
do
not
believe
that--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--this
would
fall
within
that.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--yes.
and
i
wanted
to
respond
a
little
bit
to
justice
scalia's
point.
i
think
what
they're
trying
to
claim
is,
because
they
have
municipal
taxpayer
standing
to
challenge
the
property
tax
exemption,
that
that
somehow
allows
them,
then,
to
sweep
in
their
challenge
to
the
investment
tax
credit,
as
well.
we
don't
dispute
that
they
have
municipal
taxpayer
standing
to
challenge
the
property
tax
exemption.
we
do,
however,
dispute
whether
or
not
that
gives
them
standing
to
also
challenge
the
itc.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
the
property
tax
exemption
is
a
state
tax
program,
your
honor,
but
it
requires
action
by
local
city
leaders--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--to--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--it--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--it--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--in
a
sense,
that's
right,
your
honor.
this
court
has
noted
that
the
relationship
between
a
municipal
citizen
and
a
municipal
corporation
is
akin
to
between
a
shareholder
and
a
corporation,
generally,
and
that,
in
some
instances,
that
will
allow
the
municipal
citizens
to
challenge
the
actions
of
their
municipal
leaders,
in
a
sense.
this
property
tax
exemption
involves
that
type
of
action.
it
would,
in
a
sense,
be
a
challenge
to
that,
and,
i
think,
cognizable
under
the
court's
municipal
taxpayer--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--your
honor,
when
looked
at
from
a
numerical
basis,
i
agree
that
the
distinction
might
not
seem
to
carry
a
lot
of
weight.
the
court,
however,
has
not
looked
at
it
in
terms
of
numbers,
it
has
looked
at
it
in
terms
of
the,
quote,
"special
relationship"
that
arises
between
a
municipal
citizen
and
a...
and
a
corporation.
and
presumably
that
special
relationship
exists
independent
of
the
size
of
the
municipality.
but,
in
any
event,
whether
or
not
they
have
municipal
taxpayer
standing
to
challenge
the
property
tax
exemption,
there's
no
way
to
somehow
grow
that
into
standing
to
challenge
the
separate
enactment
by
the
ohio
general
assembly.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
it
wouldn't,
your
honor,
although--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i
think
it
puts
a
point
on
the
problem
with,
in
a
sense,
trying
to
grow
standing.
you
asked,
would
it
redress?
and
i
guess
the
question
is,
redress
what?
i
mean,
they
don't
have
any
separate
harm
associated
with
the
investment
tax
credit
that's
constitutionality
cognizable.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but,
still,
there
needs
to
be
some
way
to
grow
the
municipal
taxpayer
standing
into--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--standing
to--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--right.
exactly,
your
honor.
and
my
only
suggestion
was
that,
even
if
there
is
municipal
taxpayer
standing
to
challenge
a
property
tax
exemption,
which
we've
conceded
below,
that
doesn't
somehow
confer
standing
to
challenge
of
separate
enactment
by
ohio's
general
assembly.
respondents,
in
their
brief,
talk
about
this
notion
of
ancillary
standing,
but
that...
the
case
they
cited...
and
they...
principally,
they
talk
about
the
flast
case,
where,
in
addition
to
considering
the
establishment
clause
challenge,
the
court
also,
in
a
footnote,
mentioned
the
free
exercise
challenge
and
the
question
of
whether
there
would
be
separate
standing
for
that.
but
there,
in
the
flast
case,
it
was
a
situation
where
they
were
using
two
theories
to
attack
the
same
legislative
enactment.
here,
they're
trying
to
attack
a
statute
which
they
haven't
shown
causes
them
any
harm.
and
so,
the
case
is...
the
challenge
that
they
are
bringing
is,
in
a
sense,
an
abstract
challenge.
it
isn't
one
that's
in
a...
in
a
form
that's
judicially
cognizable.
that's
why
this
ancillary
standing
theory,
which
would
represent
a
dramatic
expansion
of
the
court's
article
iii
jurisprudence,
would
not
be
a
sound
constitutional
interpretation.
it
would
allow
the
court
to
interject
itself
into
disputes
where
there's
no
injury
to
any...
no
concrete
injury
to
any
specifically
identified
plaintiff.
article
iii's
case
for
a
controversy
requirement
is
supposed
to
ensure
that
when
the
court
takes
action,
it
takes
action
in
the
context
of
a
particular
concrete
harm,
and
it
can
do
its
legal
analysis
against
the
backdrop
of
this
plaintiff
who's
been
harmed
in
this
manner.
these
plaintiffs
can't
meet
that.
they
haven't
shown
any
harm
to
themselves,
any
judicially
cognizable
harm,
under
article
iii.
if
i
could,
for
a
moment,
your
honors,
i'd
also
like
to
turn
to
the
merits,
briefly,
of
the
respondents'
claim.
we
believe
respondents'
claim
also
fails
on
the
merits
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
ohio
provides
a
benefit
for
those
who
invest
in
the
state;
but
respondents
have
not,
and
cannot,
identify
any
burden
that
the
itc
places
on
interstate
commerce.
absent
that
burden,
their
dormant
commerce
clause
claim
fails.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
i
don't
think
that...
that's
not
the
way
that
i
understand
their--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--claim,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i
understand
their
claim...
i
understand
their
claim
more
to
be
that
two
identically
situated
businesses,
if...
both
have
the
same
tax
bill...
one
builds
a
new
facility
in
ohio,
one
builds
a
new
facility
in
wisconsin.
the
one
who
builds
the
new
facility
in
ohio
is
going
to
have
a
lower
tax
bill
than
the
one
who
builds
the
new
facility
in
wisconsin.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
your--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
your
honor,
first,
i'd
note
that's
not
a
harm
that
they
face,
of
course,
going
back
to--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--standing
issue,
but--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--yes.
but--
[laughter]
--separately,
your
honor,
i
think
what...
in
this
court's
dormant
commerce
clause
jurisprudence,
when
the
court
has
talked
about
"burden",
in
the
past,
the
court
has
talked
about
the
situation
where
activity
out
of
state
is
somehow
assessed
a
tax.
that
is,
the
tax
in
state
a
goes
up
as
a
result
of
activities
in
state
b.
the
westinghouse
case
is
a
perfect
example.
there,
there
was
a
new
york
tax
that
increased
for
each
export
transaction
that
occurred
outside
the
state.
in
a
sense,
new
york
was
exporting
the
tax
burden
to
activities
that
existed
in
some
other
state.
and
that's
the
sense
in
which
the
court
has
used
the
word
"burden"
in
its
past
cases,
not
this
more
amorphous
sense
that
plaintiffs...
or
respondents
are
pushing
here.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
there's
no
limit
on
where
the
taxpayer
purchases
the
equipment
they
install
in
the
state.
there's
no
limit...
no
effect
on
where
the
goods
from
the
factory
go.
there's
no
limit
on
who
you
can
hire
to
work
in
the
factory,
or
where
they
come
from.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
credit
is
available
independent
of
whether
you
already
have
a
presence
in
ohio,
whether
you've
never
had
a
presence
in
ohio,
whether
you've
never
even
paid
taxes
in
ohio
before.
certainly,
if
you
invested
in
the
state,
you're
now
going
to
have
a
corporate
franchise
tax
bill,
and
the
credit
would
be
useful
to
you
at
that
point.
but
you
could
have
had
no
preexisting
relationship
with
the
state
at
all,
as
a
taxpayer,
and
still
take
advantage
of
this
tax
credit.
it's
equally
available
to
all
comers.
the
only
question
is,
what
do
you
do
in
the
state
of
ohio?
do
you
invest
money
in
the
state
of
ohio?
and
the
credit
turns
on
the
amount
of
that
activity
in
ohio.
if
daimlerchrysler
establishes
a
new
plant
in
missouri
or
montana
or
california,
it,
in
no
way,
impacts
the
credit
that
they
receive
in
ohio.
they're
not
deprived
of
that
credit.
it
doesn't
become
of
a...
of
a
lower
value
because
of
their
decision
to
invest
elsewhere.
and
so,
under
this
court's--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--interestingly,
your
honor,
it--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i
would...
i
would
hope
not,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think
the
sense
is
that
it
increases
investment
in
ohio.
and
that's
what
this
court
has
called
a
"laudable
goal"
of
state
economic
policy,
is
to
try
to
increase
investment
within
the
state
to
benefit
the
citizens
of
the
state.
certainly,
that's--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
responses
to
that.
first,
to
the
extent
this
spurs
investment
that
otherwise
would
not
have
taken
place
anywhere
else,
of
course
that's
just
positive
sum.
that's
new
economic
development
that
wouldn't
have
occurred,
but
for
this
incentive,
or
incentives
like
it.
of
course,
at
some
level
there's
going
to
be
competition
for
where
these
manufacturing
facilities
are
located.
but,
again,
this
court
has
noted
that
competition
among
the
states
for
their
share...
or
their
fair
share
of
interstate
commerce
is
not,
in
and
of
itself,
a
commerce
clause
problem.
the
question
is
only
when
that
competition
becomes
discriminatory
in
some
way.
and
what
the
court
has
meant
by
"discriminatory"
is,
does
it
somehow
tax
your
decision
to
be
somewhere
else?
when
you
decide
to
be
in
missouri,
does
that
increase
your
ohio
tax
bill
over
what
it
would
otherwise
be?
camps
newfound,
perfect
example.
you
decide
that
you're
going
to
serve
an
interstate
clientele,
your
tax
bill
goes
up
above
what
it
would
be
if
you
didn't
serve
an
interstate
clientele.
and
ohio's
tax
credit
doesn't
have
that
characteristic
that
the
court
has
found
so
troubling.
in
fact,
looking
back
through
the
court's
cases,
over
and
over
again
this
notion
of
burden
comes
up,
and...
whereby,
"burden",
it
means
"imposing
taxes
on
the
business
of
other
state.
"
all
the
way
back
to
guy
versus
baltimore,
"you
can't
build
up
your
commerce
by
means
of
an...
unequal
and
oppressive
burdens
upon
the
industry
and
business
of
other
states.
"
so,
certainly
if
ohio
were
attempting
to
tax
daimlerchrysler,
or
treat
daimlerchrysler
worse
because
it
had
put
a
plant
in
missouri,
that
would
create
a
dormant
commerce
clause
question.
but
here,
there's
simply
nothing
like
that.
in
fact,
respondents'
theory
would
dramatically
expand
this
court's
dormant
commerce
clause
jurisprudence,
and
would
strike
down
a
whole
swath
of
state
laws
that
have
engendered
substantial
investment
backed
expectation
at
this
point.
billions
of
dollars
have
been
invested
by
thousands
of
companies
in
reliance
on
various
forms
of
locational
credits,
whether
it
be
job
incentive
credits,
whether
it
be
investment
tax
credits,
whether
it
be
environmental
cleanup
credits.
all
of
those
credits
would
be
at
risk
under
the
theory
that
plaintiffs
espouse.
your
honors,
this
court
has
more
than
once
noted
that
the
commerce
clause
demands
that
the
states
must
sink
or
swim
together,
but
it
has
never
suggested
that
the
states
must
be
indifferent
between
those
two
options.
frankly,
your
honor,
the
states
would
prefer
to
swim.
itcs
like
ohio's
help
the
states
keep
their
economies
afloat.
respondents
disagree
with
this,
as
a
policy
matter,
but
that
debate
belongs
in
ohio's
statehouse,
not
here.
the
itc
is
not
protectionist,
and
it
imposes
no
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
and,
thus,
it
does
not
violate
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
ohio
respectfully
urges
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
below
or,
in
the
alternative,
to
vacate
the
decision
for
lack
of
standing.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
your
honor,
i
don't
actually
think
it
would
be
any
different,
in
the
sense
that
neither
one
of
those
two
would
violate
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
of
course,
this
court
has
noted,
in
various
cases,
albeit
in
dicta,
that
subsidies
ordinarily
do
not
run
afoul
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
i
think
this
tax
credit
ends
up
having
the
same
economic
impact.
and,
for
all
the
reasons
i
stated
about
a
lack
of
burden,
even
if
some
tax
credits
that
might
be
like
subsidies
could
create
a
dormant
commerce
clause
problem,
this
tax
credit
does
not.
it
imposes
no
burden
on
out
of
state
activities.
thank
you.
