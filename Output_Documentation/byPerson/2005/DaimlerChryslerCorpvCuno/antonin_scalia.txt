justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
there
has
to
be
somebody
who
can
challenge
it,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
our
opinions
say
that,
don't
they,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
necessarily
true
that
there
has
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
any
case,
it's
clear
that
that...
that
that
entity
no
longer
has
standing,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
don't...
i
mean,
i
thought
the
assumption
here
is
that
they
don't
have
standing.
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
former
standing
of
kim's
auto
cannot
allow
this
suit
to
proceed,
under
any
theory--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
have
to
have
standing
during
the
entire--
justice
antonin
scalia
--process--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
the
only
person
who
could
give
them
standing,
even
by
this
associational
theory,
is
gone.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
are
not
property
taxpayers
who
have
standing
under
any...
under
the
argument
that
you've
just
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
property
tax
individual
who
had
standing
was
somebody
whose
land
had
been
condemned.
none
of
these
other
people
in
it
have
had
their
land
condemned--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
whose
land
has
been
condemned.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
say
that
a
property
taxowner,
simply
by
being...
simply
by
being
subject
to
the
property
tax,
does
not
have
standing.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
also
a
redressability
problem,
too,
isn't
there?
i
mean,
assuming
they
could,
is
there
any...
would
action
against
the
assembly
eliminate
their
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
credit's
available
to
out
of
state
companies.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
could
i
ask
about
the
ancillary
doctrine?
you
say
the
case
you
cite
to
establish
it
is
flast
versus
cohen.
was
the
doctrine
discussed
in
flast
versus
cohen,
or
are
you
relying
simply
on
the
fact
that
flast
versus
cohen
involved
both
an
establishment
clause
and
a
free
exercise
challenge,
and
the
court
only
discussed
the
establishment
clause
challenge?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
had
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--recollected
that
footnote.
i
will...
i
will
find
it.
i
don't
read
footnotes,
normally.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
fact
that
a
state
has
a
lower
income
tax
or
a
lower
property
tax
than
any
other
state
in
the
union?
does
that
violate
the
commerce
clause
because
it
induces
businesses
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
only
one
who
gets
the
advantage
of
the
lower...
the
lower
income
tax
rate
and
the
lower
property
tax
rate
is
someone
who
is
located
in
the
state.
it's
exactly
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
told
you,
you
have
to
locate...
you'd
have
to
locate
in
the
low
tax
state
to
get
advantage
of
the
low...
of
the
low
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
likewise,
a
business
that
does
not
locate
in
ohio
is
not
subject
to
the...
to
the
higher
ohio
tax,
which
has
been
reduced
for
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
they're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they're
exempt
from
it
entirely,
which
is
even
better,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
legislation
that
established
this
tax
benefit...
was
it
controversial?
were
there
those
who
opposed
it
as
a
giveaway
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
have...
i
will
take
judicial
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
such
proposals
are
sometimes
politically
controversial.
isn't
that
the
place
to
fight
out
this
thing?
isn't
your
basic
objection
here
that
you
don't
agree
that
a
state
should
give
tax
credits
to
business,
and
that's
something
that,
you
know,
is
in
the
political
arena,
and
let
the
people
fight
it
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
that
be
an
issue
that
a
court
should
decide?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
they're...
what
our
opinions
hold
are
that
there
are
some
matters
of
producing
the
same
result
as
a
cash
subsidy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
are
no
good,
but
there
are
other
matters
that
are
perfectly
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
has
the
same
effect
as
a
cash
subsidy
is
not
a
problem,
as
far
as
the
commerce
clause
is
concerned.
and
what
you're
arguing
here
is,
the
mere
fact
that
it
has
that
effect
of
favoring
businesses
that
choose
to
locate
in
ohio
is
what
makes
it
bad,
not
the
fact
that
it's
relieving,
from
a
tax
that
applies
to
both
in
state
and
out
of
state
businesses,
only
in
state
business.
that's...
that
was
the
hawaii
case,
and
all
the
other
cases
you
cite.
but
what...
your
argument
here
is
that
the
mere
fact
of
providing
a
subsidy
violates
the
commerce
clause.
and
i
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--any
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
tax
did
apply
to
out
of
state
businesses--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
they
got
no
reduction--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
lot
of
money
in
building
homes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
believe
in
harmonization,
mr.
olson?
