justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
who
would
have...
who
would
have
standing?
i
understand
your
argument
that
ohio
taxpayers
don't,
but
are
there
people
who
would
have
standing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
i
had
asked
you
the
question,
because
i
wanted
to
know
whether
this
case
was
distinguishable
from
flast
in
that
regard,
although
i
recognize
your
quotation
from
valley
forge.
that...
flast
seemed
to
be
a
case
that
fit
that
description,
that
there
was
no
one
who
would
have
a
better
claim
for
injury,
in
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
i
don't
mean
to
deflect
you
from
getting
on
to
the
merits,
but
there
was
one
point
in
your
brief
that
was
of
concern
to
me.
that
is,
you
said
that
you
questioned
whether,
assuming
we
accept
your
argument
on
standing,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
return
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
instructions
that
it
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
and
with
the
counsel
fees
that
1447
entitle
one
to.
and
you
said
that
would
not
be
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
because
it's
a
local...
it's
a
toledo
city
property
tax,
is
that
the
distinction
you're
making?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
would
be
challenging
the
local
action--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--rather
than
the
state--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--action,
and
that's
how
you
distinguish
the
municipal
taxpayer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
some...
at
least
it's
arguable
that
there's
federal
municipal
taxpayer
standing.
and
certainly
some
states
have
said
that
there
is.
and
that...
and
whatever
ohio
might
or
might
do
is
not
relevant
to
this
proceeding.
we
don't
know
that.
i'm...
you've
given
your
opinion
on
what
it
would
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
the
piggybacking
question.
that's
quite
different.
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
isn't...
the
tax
credit
doesn't
give
them...
require
them
to
buy,
in
state.
i
mean,
the
purchase...
whatever
they
equip
the
plant
with
can
come
from
vendors
and
manufacturers,
out
of
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
any
authority
at
all
for
saying
you
can
piggyback
the
basic
case
or
controversy
requirement?
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
to
say
you
can
hook
a
nondiverse
claim,
but
it's
a
claim;
it's
a
case
or
controversy.
i'm...
i
don't
know
of
any
authority
that
says
that
you
can...
you
can
take
a
matter
that
is
not
a
constitutional
case
or
controversy
and
latch
it
onto
something
that
does
qualify.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it
was
pointed
out
that,
in
flast,
at
least,
you
were
dealing
with
the
same
spending
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government.
here,
you
have
apples
and
oranges.
the
property
tax
is
quite
discrete
from
the
investment
tax
credit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
problem
in
craig,
with
the
name
plaintiff,
is,
it
wasn't
a
class
action,
an
18-year-old
sent
to
turn
21
in
the
fullness
of
time.
but
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
about
the
beer
seller
whose
standing
saved
the
case,
at
least
in
the
view
of
the
majority
of
this
court.
she
had
a
real
pocketbook
injury.
she
was
not
able
to
sell
her
beer
to
the
thirsty
boys.
so--
[laughter]
--i
don't
understand
why
that's
an
example
of
a
loose
standing
connection.
i
mean,
she
surely
had
an...
a
pocketbook
injury.
true,
she
was
complaining
about
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
the
fraternity
brothers,
but
that
she
had
an
injury,
in
fact,
there
was
no
doubt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
lack
of
standing
below.
the
problem
was
that
the...
craig
turned
21
while
the
case
was
pending
in
this
court.
there
was
standing
below.
he
was
18
when
the
litigation
started.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
they
were
attacking
the
same
thing.
so,
your
case
is
different,
at
least
to
that
extent,
that
you
have
two
discrete
taxes.
