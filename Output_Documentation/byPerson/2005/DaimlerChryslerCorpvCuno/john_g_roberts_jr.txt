chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
04-1704,
chrysler
versus...
daimlerchrysler
versus
cuno,
and
04-1724,
wilkins
versus
cuno.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
claims
that
are
before
us.
but
there
was
standing
below
for
the
municipal
taxpayers
with
respect
to
their
challenge
to
the
property
taxes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
why
isn't...
these...
why
aren't
the
present
claims
brought
under...
you
know,
within
the
same
nucleus
of
operative
facts,
the
same
sort
of
supplemental
jurisdiction
that
allows
the
federal
court
to
consider
purely
state
law
claims
if
they
have
jurisdiction
of
another
related
federal
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
just
to
get...
i
mean,
you
don't
dispute
the
standing
of
the
municipal
taxpayers
on
the
property
tax
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it's
an
article
iii
issue,
i
think
that's
always
before
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
was
thinking
if
your...
if
the
argument
is
that
the
claims
that
you're
concerned
about
today
can
be
piggybacked
onto
the
other
ones,
then
we
do
have
to
consider
whether
there's
a
pig
to
piggyback
them
onto.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cole.
do
they
have
standing
in
state
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
what
about
the
municipal
taxpayers
on
the
property
tax
claim
that
we
were
talking
about
earlier?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
they
have
standing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
a
tax...
just...
so,
a
taxpayer
in
wyoming
can't
challenge
a
state
tax,
because
his
claim
is
too
diffuse,
but
a
resident
in
new
york
city
can
challenge
the
city
tax,
because
it's
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
would
be
of
higher
value
if
they
invest
it
in
ohio.
i
mean,
that's
all--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--presumably,
the
ohio
legislators
were
not
doing
this
irrationally.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that...
in
some
sense,
at
the
expense
of
the
citizens
in
other
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cole.
mr.
enrich.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--can
i
back
you
up
just
a
bit
before
we
talk
about
piggybacking?
this
court
hasn't
held
that
municipal
taxpayers
have
standing
in
this
sort
of
situation,
have
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
if
you
want
us
to
piggyback,
we...
and
if
it
is
an
article
iii
question...
we
would
have
to
decide
that
issue
before
we
can
decide
whether
we
can
piggyback
your
current
claims
onto
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
you
agree
that
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
you
agree
that
the
municipal
taxpayer
standing
on
the
property
tax
question
is
an
open
issue
before
this
court.
we
have
not
had
a
holding
on
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
all
the...
but
all
you're
saying...
but
you
have
to
do
business
in
the
state
with
the
lower
income
tax
rate
to
get
the
advantage
of
the
lower
rate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--would
seem
to
present
the
same
commerce
clause
problem
that
you're
posing
for
us
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
some
states...
counsel,
some
states
have
homestead
exemptions
to
property
taxes
for
people
when
they're
buying
homes
in
the
state.
that...
those
would
be
invalid
under
your
theory?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
person
may
have
another
piece
of
property
in
the...
in
the
other
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
he's
not
getting
the
benefit
of
this,
because
his
homestead...
he
lives
somewhere
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they're
two
identical
cases
of
property,
and
they'll
say...
one
say,
"you're
going
to
be
taxed
at
a
lower
rate
if
that's
where
you're
living,
if
that's
your
homestead;
but
if
you
have
to
live
outside
the
state,
you're
going
to
get
taxed
at
a
higher
rate.
"
it
would
seem
to
me
very
similar
to
what
you're
challenging
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
imposing
tax
on
property
in
the
state
at
a
higher
rate
if
it's
not
the
person's
homestead;
in
other
words,
if
they
don't
live
in
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
the
same
purpose.
there's
some
place...
they
want
people
to
move
in...
into
the
district
here,
for
example,
just
like
ohio
wants
businesses
to
move
in.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
olson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
in
04-1704,
daimler
chrysler
corporation
versus
cuno.
this
case
began
when
the
city
of
toledo
and
state
of
ohio
offered
daimler
chrysler
local
and
state
tax
benefits
to
encourage
it
to
expand
its
jeep
operation
in
toledo.
toledo
residents
who
pay
local
and
state
taxes
claimed
that
the
tax
breaks
violated
the
commerce
clause.
the
6th
circuit
agreed
that
some
of
the
tax
benefits
violated
the
commerce
clause,
and
we
granted
review
to
consider
whether
they
did.
the
constitution,
however,
requires
that
federal
courts
decide
questions
of
law
only
when
they
are
presented
in
a
concrete
case.
before
we
decide
the
commerce
clause
question
that
has
divided
the
parties,
we
have
to
make
sure
it
arises
in
a
proper
case
or
controversy,
as
the
constitution
requires.
among
other
things,
this
means
that
we
have
to
determine
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
actually
been
injured
by
the
conduct
that
they
are
complaining
about.
if
a
person
did
not
have
to
show
a
concrete
injury
of
some
sort
before
gaining
access
to
federal
court,
then
anyone
could
challenge
any
government
action
or
decision
in
federal
court,
simply
because
they
disagreed
with
it.
that
would
give
the
courts
a
very
different
role
in
our
system
than
the
role
intended
by
the
framers.
the
plaintiffs
here
claim
injury
because
the
tax
breaks
given
to
daimler
chrysler
might
result
in
a
decrease
in
the
amount
of
money
flowing
into
the
treasuries
of
ohio
and
toledo.
in
response
to
this
possible
decrease,
the
state
and
the
city
might
decide
to
increase
the
taxes
that
the
plaintiffs
pay.
“might”
here
is
not
enough
to
show
the
sort
of
injury
that
the
constitution
requires.
we
cannot
simply
assume
that
the
tax
breaks
will
deplete
the
treasuries
and
that,
if
they
do,
the
officials
responsible
for
deciding
what
to
do
about
that
would
choose
to
make
up
a
short
fall
from
the
plaintiffs’
pockets.
we
have
long
held
that
federal
taxpayers
do
not
get
to
challenge
the
legality
of
actions
by
the
federal
government,
simply
because
they
are
federal
taxpayers.
the
same
rule
applies
to
state
taxpayers
attempting
to
challenge
state
government
actions
in
federal
court.
we
have
recognized
one
exception
to
the
rule
against
taxpayers
being
able
to
sue,
simply
because
they
are
taxpayers.
we
have
allowed
federal
taxpayers
to
challenge
congressional
actions
under
the
establishment
clause,
when
their
only
claimed
injury
is
as
a
taxpayer.
but
that
is
because
of
the
special
nature
of
the
establishment
clause,
interpreted
to
directly
prohibit
the
government
from
taking
money
from
citizens
to
be
put
to
improper
religious
use.
the
commerce
clause
does
not
have
that
feature,
so
plaintiffs
cannot
establish
injury
by
likening
their
claim
to
an
establishment
clause
claim.
in
a
ruling
that
we
don’t
review
today,
the
district
court
held
that
plaintiffs
were
injured
by
exemptions
from
municipal
taxes
that
the
city
gave
to
daimler
chrysler.
the
plaintiffs
claim
that
this
injury
is
enough
to
support
their
challenge
to
the
state
tax
credit,
because
both
tax
breaks,
the
state
and
the
local,
were
part
of
the
same
package.
for
this
claim,
they
rely
on
this
court’s
decision
in
mineworkers
versus
gibbs.
but
gibbs
held
only
that
a
federal
court
can
hear
state
law
claims
that
may
be
viewed
as
part
of
he
same
case,
because
they
are
closely
related
to
a
federal
law
claim.
gibbs
did
not
say
that
any
claim
closely
related
to
a
federal
law
claim
may
be
heard
in
federal
court.
if
gibbs
meant
that,
federal
courts
could
hear
all
sorts
of
questions
that
the
constitution
would
otherwise
prohibit
them
from
hearing
in
a
particular
proceeding,
simply
because
they
were
factually
related
to
a
claim
that
the
constitution
permits
them
to
hear.
since
marbury
versus
madison,
we
have
understood
our
power
to
construe
the
constitution
to
be
grounded
in
our
responsibility
to
decide
particular
cases
raising
constitutional
questions.
plaintiffs
here
have
not
established
that
the
commerce
clause
issue
they
want
us
to
decide
is
presented
in
a
concrete
case,
as
the
constitution
requires.
we
therefore
cannot
decide
it,
and
the
6th
circuit
should
not
have
decided
it,
either.
for
the
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
in
part
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
dismissal
of
the
plaintiffs’
challenge
to
the
state
tax
credit.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
