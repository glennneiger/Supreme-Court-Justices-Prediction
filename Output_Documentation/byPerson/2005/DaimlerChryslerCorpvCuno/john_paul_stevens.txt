may
i
ask
this
question?
would
the
case
be
any
different
if,
instead
of
a
tax
credit,
they
offered
a
cash
subsidy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
adversary?
suppose,
instead
of
a
tax
credit,
they
said,
"we'll
pay
for
the
construction
cost
of
a
building,
or
we'll
give
you
a
piece
of
real
estate,
in
order
to
get
you
to
come
in.
"
"part
of
big
redevelopment

"#
program,
we
would
give
you
this
parcel
of
real
estate.
"
would
that
also
be
subject
to
the
same
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
they
wouldn't
be
acting...
other
than
the
one
transaction,
"we'll
give
you
one
particular
benefit
in
this
new
development
progress...
project,
with
no
further
participation
as
a
market
participant
or
anything
like
that.
"
that
would...
it
seems
to
me
that
would
fit
right
into
your
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
terms
of
discrimination
and
economic
impact,
they
really
are
the
same,
right?
