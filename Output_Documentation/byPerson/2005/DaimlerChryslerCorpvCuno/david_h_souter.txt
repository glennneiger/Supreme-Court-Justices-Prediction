what's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what's
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
the
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
the
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
the
tax
example.
i
mean,
the
taxes
are
apportioned.
the
part
of
the
tax...
or
the
business
that
would
be
taxable
in
the
state
gets
taxed
at
a
lower
rate.
businesses
say,
"gee,
let's
do
more
business
in
ohio
and
pay
less
taxes.
"
in
this
case,
they're
getting,
effectively,
taxed
at
a
lower
rate,
because
they
make
an
investment
in
ohio.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
what
you
call--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
you
call
discrimination
is
any
differential.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
effective
tax
differential
is
a
quid
pro
quo
for
an
investment.
and,
basically,
your
argument
boils
down
to
saying
that
there's
discrimination
whenever
the
state
offers
a
quid
pro
quo
for
an
advantage
and
somebody
decides
not
to
take
advantage
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
discrimination.
that
is
simply
the
effect
of
a
free
choice,
and
any
business
is
free
to
make
that
choice.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
could...
i
could
see
your
argument,
if,
for
example,
in
the
tax
exchange
case,
there
was
not
taxation
being
made
of
the
out
of
state
transactions.
but
that
was
the
case
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
tax.
and
there
is...
there's
no
such
parallel
here.
justice
david
h.

except
the
criterion
is
not
mere
in
state
activity.
the
criterion
is
a
particular
in
state
activity,
an
investment,
as
to
which
the
credit
is
a
quid
pro
quo.
and
the
opportunity
to
make
that
investment
is
open
to
every
business,
presently
in
state,
presently
out
of
state,
no
matter
where
domiciled.
