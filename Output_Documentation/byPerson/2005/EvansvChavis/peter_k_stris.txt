mr.
peter
k.
stris
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
light
of
justice
breyer's
questions,
i
feel
compelled
to
begin
with
a
brief
explanation
of
why
this
case
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
saffold.
and,
although
it
wasn't
my
initial
intention
to
speak
plainly,
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
the
problem
is
not
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case,
but,
rather,
california's
timeliness
standards.
and
the
problem
that's
presented
by
this
case
is
one
of
federal
line
drawing.
and
it
presents
serious
federalism,
comity,
and
fairness
concerns.
and
if
we
could
step
back
from
the
facts
of
this
case
for
a
moment...
and
i
will
discuss
them...
i
think
it...
i
hope,
at
least,
it
will
become
clear
that
the
ninth
circuit,
in
light
of
what
it's
dealing
with
in
california,
adopted
the
only
sensible
rule.
so,
the
place
to
begin
in
answering
some
of
your
questions,
justice
breyer,
is
with
california's
timeliness
standards.
and
to
give
some
background,
i
would
start
with
the
principle
that
was
articulated
in
the
warden's
brief
and
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
articulated,
which
is
that
california
does
enforce
its
timeliness
standards.
it's
usually
done
by...
in
the
summary
denial
context,
by
citing
to
in
re
swain
or
in
re
robbins--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--oh,
i--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--apologize.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
what
i
had
said
is
that
california
does
enforce
it's--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--timeliness
standards.
and
the
way
they
customarily
do
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--okay.
the
standards
are
that
a
prisoner
must
file
within
a
reasonable
time.
and
that
requires
a
two
part
inquiry,
justice
o'connor.
the
first
part
is,
was
there
substantial
delay?
it's
determined
based
upon
a
set
standard,
when
the
delay
begins.
but
california's
never
articulated
any
standards
for
what
period
of
time
constitutes
"substantial".
that's
the
first
problem.
it's
essentially
an
ad
hoc
determination
that's
made
by
individual
california
courts.
and
that's
why
former
justice
brown
described
that
as
"an
abstraction",
and
former
justice
moss
described
it
as
"vague
and
indeterminate
at
its
very
core.
"
but
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
is
dealing
with
when
it
reviews
these
cases.
so,
to
put
it
context
for
a
moment,
the
way
the
state
courts
do
enforce
this
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
to
be
practical,
is,
the
state
supreme
court
often
summarily
dismisses
cases
on
procedural
bars,
including
timeliness.
and,
to
give
you
some
statistics
from
the
warden's
brief,
in
2004
there
were
1,223
unexplained
summary
denials...
in
other
words,
just
denied...
and
there
were
1,174
denials
with
a
citation
to
a
case.
and
this
is
significant,
because
this
means
that,
in
about
half
of
the
cases
in
2004
that
went
to
the
california
supreme
court,
they
enforced
one
of
their
procedural
bars,
and,
in
many
of
them,
it
was
timeliness.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i'm
not
sure...
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--question,
justice
scalia.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
oh.
what
i...
what
i
was
suggesting
is
that
there
were
1,174
cases
that
were
procedural
bar
cases,
where
it
said--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that's
correct.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
it
would
say,
"denied,
in
re
swain",
meaning
denied
for
being
untimely.
as
opposed,
justice
scalia,
to
the
1,223
cases
that
were
unexplained.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that's
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
okay.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
okay.
well,
as
to
the
first
question,
the
explanation
that
you
just
provided
clearly
requires
the
federal
courts,
when
there's
some
indication
from
the
state
court
that
it
might
have
been
untimely,
to
look
into
it.
and
that
was
the
very
problem
with
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
that
case.
it
said
"on
the
merits
and
for
lack
of
diligence.
"
so,
to
presume
that
that
was
just
on
the
merits,
that's
flatly
wrong.
you'd
need
to
do
some
further
investigation.
in
light
of
the
context
of
what's
happening
in
california,
however,
when
the
state
court
says
nothing,
there
has
to
be
some
process
by
which
the
federal
court
can
make
a
decision
as
to
what
that
means,
because
if,
in
fact,
in
that
case
it
was
denied
no
the
merits
and
the
state
court
thought
it
was
timely,
it
would
be
extremely
invasive
for
the
federal
court
to
rereview
the
case,
potentially
come
to
a
different
conclusion,
and,
we
would
suggest,
dramatically
alter
the
landscape
of
how
prisoners
exhaust
their
remedies
in
california,
because
now
you're
developing
a
federal
body
of
law
that
may
be
very
different
in
deciding
what's
substantial
and
what's
reasonable
than
california
did.
and
so,
what
the
ninth
circuit,
i
believe,
did
in
this
case
was
look
to
context
and
come
up
with
the
presumption
that
was
most
reasonable
in
light
of
what's
going
on.
so,
the
first
thing
that
is
relevant,
from
a--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--the--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--the
answer...
pardon
me--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--the
answer,
i
would
suggest,
justice
scalia,
requires
looking
to
california
practice.
and
where
i
would
start
is
with
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
in
re
sanders.
and
in
in
re
sanders,
the
court
made
clear
that
after
the
supreme
court
adopted
their
policies
in
1989
regarding
certain
presumptions
in
capital
cases,
and
after
the
seminal
in
re
clark
case
in
1993,
which
asserted...
rather,
articulated
california's
timeliness
standards,
most
petitions...
and
these
are
the
california
supreme
court's
words...
"most
petitions
are
timely
filed".
so,
with
that
backdrop
and
the
fact
that
half
of
the
california
supreme
court's
cases
are
being
denied
with
a
case
citation,
it's
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
unexplained
denials
are
not
necessarily
untimely.
now,
i
would
add
to
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--it's
certainly
the
case,
justice
scalia,
that
the
presumptions
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
could
permit
cases
that
even
the
california
state
courts
would
consider
to
be
untimely--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--well,
that's
the--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
can't
really
answer
that,
and
that's
at
the
heart
of--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--well,
the
reason
i
would
suggest
that...
and
answering
that
is
not
necessarily
appropriate
or
helpful
in
resolving
the
question...
is
because
of
the
series
of
cases
that
we
quoted
in
footnote
15
of
our
brief.
in
certain
instances,
the
california
courts
have
found
3
and
a
half
years,
1
and
a
half
years,
2
years
to
be
reasonable.
now,
that
doesn't
mean--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--in
one
instance,
it
was
because
of
attorney
abandonment.
in
other
cases,
it
was
because
the
prisoner
was
indigent.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
oh,
i
think
it
would
apply
to
our
case,
as
well.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
in
our
case,
the
first
15
months--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--after
that,
our
client
was
effectively
on
lockdown
and
had
no
access
whatsoever
to
the
library.
now,
this
presents
the
burden
problem
with
doing
any
sort
of
independent
determination.
the
attorney
general
suggested,
in
the
district
court,
that
there
was
a
paging
system
in
place
whereby
prisoners
who
are
on
lockdown
could
get
access
to
the
library.
there
was
never
any
suggestion
in
the
district
court
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general
that
the
lockdown
didn't
exist.
and
the
attorney
general,
and
not
my
client,
would
have
access
to
those
records.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
wouldn't
call
it
an
affidavit,
but
it
was...
he
filed
an
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
and--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--yes.
i...
well,
i...
he
didn't
talk
about
not
having
access
to
the
library.
it's
implicit,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that
he
had
had...
had
access
to
nothing.
in
other
words,
he
didn't
say,
"i
didn't
have
access"--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--well,
it
would
be
on
the
joint
appendix,
pages
38
and
39,
where
he
describes
the
lockdown.
and,
you
know,
i
haven't
looked
at
it
recently,
but
my
understanding
is
that
he
was
suggesting
that
he
had
had
access
to
nothing,
including
the
prison
library.
and
the
attorney
general
suggests
that
there
was
a
paging
system,
but
the
documentary
evidence
that
the
attorney
general
puts
into
the
record,
which
is
on
pages
68...
67...
no,
pardon
me,
88
through
96...
is
a
prison
manual
that's
dated
2000.
now,
it
says
it's
amended.
but
my
client
takes
the
position
that
this
wasn't
in
the
place
at
his
prison
at
that
time,
and
that
would
require
a--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--evidentiary
hearing--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--to
determine--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--of
course.
but--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--the
burden--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--pardon
me.
the
burden
on
him
would
be
in
the
context
of
an
evidentiary
hearing,
which
never
took
place.
the
district
court
in
this
case
didn't
reach
that
issue,
because
they
found
that
statutory
tolling--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--wasn't
available.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
but
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--but
that
illustrates
the
very--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
and
that
illustrates
the
very
problem
with
this
case,
which
is
that
in
cases
where
there
is
90
days,
2
months,
4
months,
the
very
difficult
questions
that
a
federal
court
would
normally
look
to
state
law,
if
it
was
determinant,
to
apply,
california
is
giving
no
guidance.
and
our
case
falls
within
that
once
you
look
to
the
particular
explanations
that
our
client
put
forward.
and
so,
we
would
suggest
that
if
there
is
a
concern
on
the
part
of
the
court
about
certain
cases
getting
through
and
essentially
allowing
prisoners
to
abuse
the
writ,
that
this
court
will
use
its
equitable
discretion
to
look
at
individual
cases
and
to
decide,
"hey,
is
this
a
situation
where
the
behavior
is
dilatory?
"
"is
this
a
situation
where
the
behavior
is
abusive?
"
and
that
would
restrict
the
number
of
cases
where
federal
courts
would
need
to
engage
in
a
factual
inquiry.
the
alternative
is
adopting
a
presumption,
that
the
attorney
general
suggested,
that
the
california
courts
have
flatly
rejected.
that
presumption
has
been
adopted...
has
been
imported
from
the
direct
appeal
context.
it
has
no
significance
in
california
habeas
law.
in
the
direct
appeal
context,
prisoners
have
the
right
to
counsel.
in
the
habeas
context,
they
don't,
except
in
capital
cases.
and,
unsurprisingly...
pardon
me...
unsurprisingly,
the
california
supreme
court
has
adopted
a
presumption
of
90
days,
in
the
capital
context.
so,
in
the...
in
the
noncapital
cases,
like
my
client's,
where
individuals
have
no
incentive
to
delay...
my
client
has
been
up
for
parole
twice
already,
he
has
no
incentive
to
delay
the
habeas
process...
and
where
people
like
mr.
chavis
think
that
they're,
in
good
faith,
complying...
and
it's
not
just
an
issue
of
excuse...
and
this
goes
back
to
a...
to
a
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked
earlier...
there
are
specific
policy
reasons
why
the
state
of
california
has
adopted
the
standard
that
it
has.
they've
articulated--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--it
presumes
that
if
it's
within
90
days,
it's
timely.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
and
then
you
engage
in
the
inquiry.
but
that's
significant,
justice
stevens,
because
these
individuals
are
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
no,
they
do
not.
and
they've
flatly
rejected
that
and
found
cases
where
there's...
several
years'
delay,
even
in
the
capital
context,
to
be
reasonable.
but--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
there
is
not.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
no,
that's
not
true.
the--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--the--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that's
correct.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
the
burden
shifts
the
prisoner
to
produce
some
evidence.
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--in
the
noncapital
context.
and
it's
very...
it's
very
different,
because
the
california
state
courts
are
articulating
particularly...
particular
policy
reasons
for
noncapital
prisoners
to
delay.
one
that
they're
articulated
is
a
desire
to
avoid
the
piecemeal
presentation
of
claims.
and
this
is
particular
to
california's
original
writ
system.
you
can
have
a
functional
appeal,
but,
because
it's
also
an
original
writ,
you...
if
you
have
an
additional
claim
that's
legitimate,
you
need
to
add
it
in
that
claim.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
and--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--if
it
were
the
case...
and
there's
no
evidence
on
the
record
to
suggest
this...
that
a
substantial
number
of
cases
were
going
to
start
coming
through
california
with
massive
delays,
and
this
court
was
going
to
be
forced
to
provide
statutory
tolling,
that
would
be
a
problem.
but
there's
no
evidence
to
suggest
that.
and
that
ties
back
to--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--if
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--started
happening?
mr.
peter
k.
stris
if
that
started
happening,
i
think
you,
in
this
court,
would
do
nothing.
i
think
that
congress
would
see
what
was
going
on,
and
they'd
amend
the
statute,
because
that's
clearly
not
what
they
intended.
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
don't
think
they
would
do
that,
justice
ginsburg.
but
there's
a
proposal
that
i'm
aware
of,
already,
to
change
the
specific
language
of
2244(d)(2),
and
it
was
made
by
a
congressman
in
california.
it
doesn't
suggest
changing
it
for
california;
it
suggests
changing
the
language.
but
that
hasn't
happened.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
believe
it
replaces
the
word
"pending"
with
some
replacement.
and
so,
it
essentially
changes
the
tolling
provision
to
account
for
this
problem.
but
that
hasn't
happened
yet.
right
now,
we
have
a
congressional
statute
that,
on
its
face,
does
not
require
the
federal
courts--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--well,
i
think
the
problem
with
that
sort
of
rule,
justice
breyer,
is
that
it
risks
error,
because
california's
standard
is
to
indeterminate,
and
at
very
little...
it
gets
very
little
benefit.
because
there's...
there
is
no
real
harm...
there's
no
real
harm
to
the
federal
interest
here
just
because
we
have
a
conclusive
presumption.
the
very
nature
of
a
conclusive
presumption
is
that
sometimes
there
will
be
cases
that
don't
fit
the
presumption.
but,
on
this
record,
and
on
anything
i've
seen
from
my
review
of
california
procedure,
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
a...
the
federal
interest
in
avoiding
substantial
delays
is
compromised
by
the
specific
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted.
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted
a--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
would
say
two
things
about
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
thing
is,
i
would
strongly
resist
your
characterization
that
the
state
court
is
saying
nothing.
i
think
that,
in
most
cases,
they
are
saying
something,
and
that,
in
the
cases
that
involve
postcard
denials,
many
of
them,
the
court
is
saying
that
they're
timely,
and,
in
others,
those
are
the
hard
questions.
so,
i
would
restrict
your
characterization
to
the
fact
that
california
is
not
saying
something
in
some
cases.
now,
because
the
federal
statute
necessarily
imports
a
state
standard,
that's
the
very
problem
with
the
statute.
i
can
conceive
of
many
instances
where--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
if
you
took
that
to
its
logical
conclusion,
then,
when
state
courts
made
errors...
they
didn't
see
that
a
case
was
properly
filed,
they
just
missed
it...
the
federal
court
would
go
in
and
review.
or
in
a
case
where
they
did
claim
the
reverse,
the
federal
court
could
say,
"no,
there
was
clear
error.
"
but
this
court
has
rejected
that
in
saffold.
it's
rejected
it
in
pace.
and...
because
that
is
informed
by
the
very
view
that
the
tolling
provision
was
included
to
encourage
one
round
of
state
exhaustion
free
of
federal
interference.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
i
would
be
lying,
justice
breyer,
if
i
didn't
say
that
i
haven't
thought
about
that.
and
the
problem
is
that
the
rule
announced
in
saffold
isn't
the
right
rule.
it's
trying
to
deal
with
a
problem
that's
been
created
by
the
california
state
courts.
and
so,
the
solution
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted...
that's
our
proposal.
we
essentially
think
that
it
has
a
minimal
harm
to
federal
interests,
because
maybe
certain
cases
will
get
in
that
congress
didn't
intend,
but
if
you
don't
adopt
it,
there's
no
alternative.
you
can't
certify
the
question.
in
california,
you
can't
certify
to
the
court
of
appeal.
you
can't
certify
from
a
district
court.
so,
if
the
california
state
courts
aren't
going
to
change,
it's
not
incumbent
upon
this
court
to
read
the
statute
differently
than
the
proper
interpretation.
and
i
concede
the
arguments
that
were
made
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
saffold
are
very
interesting,
and
they
don't
compel,
in
my
opinion,
a
different
interpretation
of
the
statute;
they
recognize
the
difficulty
that
the
statute
presents.
and
it
presents
that
difficulty
because
it
does
incorporate,
in
some
measure,
a
state
standard,
and
because
there's
one
state
out
there,
california,
that's
doing
something
that's
very
difficult
to
deal
with.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
a
problem,
because,
like
i
said
before,
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
have
no...
i've
seen
no
specific
evidence
to
be
able
to
answer
that
with
any
citation,
but
my
understanding,
justice
stevens,
is
that
that
makes
sense,
because
it's
the
last
process
that
the
prisoner
is
going
to
be
able
to
engage
in,
then
they'll
have
to
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
it
is...
it
is
necessary,
in
my
opinion.
i
don't
know
if
the
state...
if
this
court
has
ever--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--decided
that.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
but
once
you
start
from
the
premise
that
these
are
functional
appeals,
which
they
are,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
read
aedpa
any
other
way.
i
mean,
aedpa
says
that
if
there's
an
available
method
to
challenge
and...
a
petition,
whether
it
be
by
review
or
original
writ,
to
the
california
supreme
court
would
be
available.
so,
you
could
be
sure
that
if
prisoners--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--didn't
file--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--yes.
if
they
didn't
file,
they'd
get
kicked
out
of
federal
court.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
would
say
two
things
about
that.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
i
don't
believe
they
ignored
it,
justice
scalia.
and
if
you
look
at
the
welch
case
that
you're
referring
to,
on
en
banc
rehearing
the
en
banc
panel
reached
a
very
different
result.
they
didn't
reach
the
issue
of
timeliness,
for
the
reasons
i
described,
but
they
determined
that
that
was
not
a
functional
appeal,
because--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--the
claim--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--the
en
banc--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--decision
occurred
after
your--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--case.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
don't
agree
with
that
characterization,
justice
scalia.
i
believe
that
case
was
included
to
illustrate
that
this
court
thought
that
was
probably
too
long,
and
that
not
looking
at
all
to
what's
happening
in
the
california
system
risks
that.
i
don't
think
anything
was
at
least
necessary
to
the
holding
in
saffold--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--because
it--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that
is
true.
and
in
the
context
of
a
case
like
saffold,
where
there's
a
reference
to
lack
of
diligence,
that
risk
is
too
great.
i'm
not
going
to
get
up
here
and
suggest
that
there's
no
risk
to
a
conclusive
presumption
that
some
cases
are
going
to
make
it
into
federal
court
that
congress
didn't
intend.
but
it's
a
balancing
that's
inherent
in
the
notion
of
federalism.
there
is
a
risk
that,
by
not
reviewing
clear
statements
by
the
california
state
court,
that
cases
get
in
that
shouldn't.
a
case
could
not
have
been
properly
filed,
and
the
state
court
didn't
find
it.
but,
in
saffold
and
in
pace,
this
court
announced
the
principle
that
once
the
state
court
decides,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
and
i
guess,
in
summation,
what
i
suggest
is
that
atmospherically
this
case
presents
a
difficult
problem.
the
ninth
circuit
is
involved.
there
is
a
five
four
decision
in
saffold.
we
recognize
those
things.
however,
there
is
no
easy
solution.
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted
a
rule
that
balances
the
very
interest
in
federalism
that
the
tolling
provision
was
intended
to
preserve,
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
some
corresponding
federal
interest
is
compromised.
and,
in
fact,
if
the
federal
courts
are
required
to
review
these
cases,
they'll
be
required
to
do
it
in
60
days,
in
70
days,
in
80
days,
and,
if
they
make
a
mistake,
and
they
find
a
case
to
be
untimely
that
the
california
court
didn't,
will
deprive
first
federal
habeas,
one
congress
didn't
intend.
that's
fundamentally
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
aedpa.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
thank
you.
