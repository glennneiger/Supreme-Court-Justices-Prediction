well,
may--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i...
no,
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
we--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
we
decided
it...
it
was
at
least
appropriate
to
give
a
hint,
aren't
we
in
a
little
bit
better
position
than
you
suggested,
in
the
light
of
carey?
because
in...
is...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought,
in
carey,
the
state
order
was
not
merely
that
it
was
on
the
merits,
but
that
it
was
on
the
merits
and
it
was
untimely.
in
other
words,
it
said
a
and
b.
and
we
said,
you
know,
"that's
ambiguous",
to
start
with,
and
then
we
went
on
and
said,
"you
know,
sometimes
"merits"
don't
mean
merits.
"
but
if
the
state
were
to
revise
its
procedure
and
say,
"we're
either
going
to
say
a
or
we're
going
to
say
b,
and
that's
our
reason.
"
and
they
said,
"it's
on
the
merits"
or
"it's
untimely",
wouldn't
it
make
sense
for
us,
even
in
the
light
of
carey,
to
say,
"okay,
we'll
accept
that
as
the...
as
the
state's
reason?
"
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--see
why.
if
they're
going
to
follow
something
like
a
prima
facie
60
day
rule,
and
it's...
it's
on
day
65,
all
they've
got
to
say
is,
"it's
untimely".
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
would--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
would...
it
would
be
fair,
but
to
call
it
a
finding
of
california
state
law
is
a...
would
be
a
bit
of
a
stretch,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
you...
you've
made
a
perfectly
good
argument
that
it
would
be
a
sensible
rule
for
california--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
adopt,
would
not
be
sensible
for
us
to
adopt.
but
i'd
have
a
hard
time
saying
that
i
could
justify
it
as
a
statement
of
current
california
law,
and
i'm--
justice
david
h.
souter
--am
i
missing
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
you're
back
to
the
presumption.
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
we're
going
to
go
further
and
say,
"oh,
well,
we
find
that
that's
what
the
state
law
is,
unless
they
tell
us
differently.
"
that's
where
i'm
having
trouble.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
we--
justice
david
h.
souter
--know
what
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
know
what
it
is.
there's
a
state
statute
of
limitations.
it
says--
justice
david
h.
souter
--3
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
here.
