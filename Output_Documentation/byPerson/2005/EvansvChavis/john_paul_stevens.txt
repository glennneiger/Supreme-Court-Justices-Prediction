justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
a
rather
probably
sort
of
stupid
question?
but
i
gather
there
are
a
large
number
of
these
cases
disposed
of
by
a
postcard.
would
there
be
anything
wrong
if
the
california
supreme
court
said,
"we're
going
to
have
two
postcards.
"
"one
says
that
the
delay
was
unreasonable,
denied.
"
--and
the
other
says
there's
nothing
to
the
merits
denied...
used
two
postcards...
wouldn't
that
solve
all
the
problems?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
could
adopt
a
60
day
rule,
or
a
90
day
rule,
and
then
just,
when
they
decided
to
not
follow
the
rule,
they'd
put
a
check
on...
say,
"well,
we
did
look
at
the
merits
in
this
case.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
must
say,
i
don't
quite
follow
the...
why
couldn't
they
simply
say
it's
untimely?
wouldn't
that...
that
it...
there
was...
it
was
not
pending
during
this
period,
because
it...
3
years
elapsed,
and
that's
unreasonable.
wouldn't
that
end
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
whether--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
was
a
reasonable
time
to
file
is
a
state
law
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--doesn't
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--california
supreme
court
sometimes
decide
that
the
time
between
the
intermediate
court's
decision
and
the
filing
in
the
california
supreme
court...
don't
they
ask
whether
that
was
reasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
they
only
relate
it
back
to
the
day
of
the
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
that,
if
you
had
a
case
in
which
the
attorney
general
raised
the...
say,
this
case,
and
yet...
and
say
california
supreme
court
wrote
an
opinion
in
which
it
said,
"now,
3
years
has
gone
by,
but
the
prisoner
has
given
us
a
very
elaborate
explanation.
"
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
"and
we
find
that
explanation
sufficient;
therefore,
we
conclude
that,
even
though
it
was
3
years,
it
was
a
reasonable
time;
and,
therefore,
we're
going
to
address
the
merits.
"
"and
we
now
address
the
merits
and
say
you
lose.
"
now,
in
that
case,
would
it
be
pending,
for
our
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
think
our
opinion
the
last
time
around
suggested
that
possibility
would
certify
into
the
california--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--supreme
court,
and
that
was
not
done.
was
any
other
effort
made
that
you
can
tell
us
about?
maybe
you
should,
off
the
record,
but
to
try
and
get
the
guidance
of
the
california
supreme
court
on
the...
on
the
state
law
problem
here?
has
anybody
suggested
to
the
court
they
might
adopt
a
rule
or
a
different
practice
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt?
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
get
one
thing
straight.
the
90-day
presumption
in
capital
cases,
that
is
that
if
it's
within
90
days,
it's
reasonable.
does
it
also
presume
that
it's
a...
more
than
90
days,
it's
unreasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand.
but
do
they
adopt
the
converse?
if
it's
more
than
90
days,
is
it
presumed
to
be
untimely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
could
see
how
they
could
overcome
a
presumption
that
way,
but
there's
not
even
a
presumption
that
over
90
days
is
unreasonable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
two
questions
about
california?
is
the
problem
we're
discussing,
with
these
long
delays,
primarily
in
the
application
the
third
range,
the
application
of
the
california
supreme
court,
as
opposed
to
lower
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
the
condition,
that
there
is
the
long
delay,
that
primarily
occurs
in
the...
in
the
application
of
state
supreme
court?
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
my
second
question
is,
have
we
decided,
or
is
it
a
matter
of
common
practice
in
california,
that
the
application
to
the
california
supreme
court
is
necessary
in
order
to
complete
the
exhaustion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we've
held
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
cases
where
there's
direct
review,
but
this
is
a
different
sort
of
animal
that
you
have
in
california.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--required.
