justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
how
this
came
about.
i
mean...
i
mean,
i'm
asking
both
sides
the
same
question.
it'll
sound
very
favorable
to
you,
but
if
you
answer
it
just
yes,
because
it's
favorable
to
you,
i
might
learn,
later,
i
was
wrong,
and
you
won't
have
had
a
chance
to
answer.
so,
i
want
your
honest
opinion
on
this.
i
don't
know
how
this
happened.
and
i
don't
know...
did
you
ask
for
en
banc?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
don't
know
how
the
california
court
could
have
read
the
opinion...
which,
of
course,
i
wrote
for
the
court,
so
maybe
i
am
reading
things
into
it
that
weren't
there...
but
i
don't
know
how
any
judge
could
read
that
opinion
we
wrote
and
come
to
this
conclusion.
i
thought
that
it
said,
you
know,
on...
that
there
are
three
issues...
what's
the
word
"pending"?
does
the
word
"pending"
apply
to
the
time
period
between
when
the
lower
court
decides
a
case
and
you
appeal?
that's
typically
20
days
or
30
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
those
20
days
or
30
days
counted
in
the
tolling
period?
i
thought
part
one
clearly
said
the
answer
is
yes.
then
we
looked
at
california,
and
they
don't
have
the
words
20
days>
["]
or
30
days>
["].
they
say
"reasonable
time".
and
then
we
said,
"still
applies,
because
20
or
30
days.
"
they
don't
have
a
radically
different
rule;
it's
a
similar
rule.
then
we
come
to
part
three,
and
it
says,
45
days>
["].
there's...
oh,
4
and
a
half
months,
wasn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
isn't
just
20
or
30
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
is
it
timely?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
there,
i
thought
the
court
said...
i
mean,
i
was
reading
it...
say,
"well,
it's
hard
to
say,
because
there
might
have
been
excuses
for
the
delay.
"
what
about
the
words
that
were
written
there,
"on
the
merits"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that
had
nothing
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
with
the
case.
the
lack
of
diligence
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
aspect
of
the
case.
but,
what
about
the
words
"on
the
merits"?
and
there,
what
i
think
the
court
wrote
is
that
the
fact
that
it
says
"on
the
merits"
doesn't
prove
it...
what...
it
doesn't
prove
that
it
was
timely.
why?
and
then
i
listed
a
bunch
of
reasons.
there
are
reasons.
sometimes
courts
say
"on
the
merits",
even
though
it's
delayed.
all
right?
they
say
"on
the
merits".
or
because
they
want
to
tell
the
prisoner
or...
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why,
all
of
which
are
listed.
so,
we
send
it
back
to
see
whether
this
4-and-a-half-month
delay,
given
the
excuses,
was
still
timely.
we...
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
now
get
a
case
where
it's
3
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
court
says,
"it's
timely,
because
they
used
the
word'on
the
merits.
"
"'.
"
but
i
thought...
i
said,
in
the
opinion,
i
thought
the
court
adopted
that
the
words
"on
the
merits"
do
not
decide
the
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
do
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
in
those
circumstances?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
did--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
ask
for
rehearing
en
banc?
because
any
judge,
including
me,
can
make
a
mistake.
what
did
you
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
didn't
ask
for
a
hearing
en
banc.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why,
when
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--get
a
fair...
because
any
judge
can
make
a
mistake--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
don't
you
just
go
and
ask
the
ninth
circuit
to
say,
"look,
this
is
not...
read
the
opinion,
read
what
they
said.
"
"correct
it.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
worse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
representing
the
attorney
general
of
california,
and
you
have
a
lot
of
litigation
in
the
ninth
circuit.
it's...
i
mean,
the
other
side's
going
to
answer
on
the
merits,
if
they
can.
and
they're
in
an
awkward
position
here,
i
understand.
but
i
need
to
know
what
to...
what
do
you
think
we
should
do?
i
mean,
here,
we
write
an
opinion,
and
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
seems
to
perhaps,
inadvertently
or
not...
and
the
reason
i
turn
to
you
is,
judges
are
busy,
they
have
huge
dockets--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and,
often,
unless
it's
very
clearly
pointed
out
by
the
lawyers,
or
the
lawyers
take
action,
you
get...
waste
everybody's
time
and
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
other
words,
he
delays,
after
he
gets
the
library
access,
for
an
extra
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is
there
any
excuse
they're
making
for
that?
because
if
you
don't
tell
me,
they're--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--going
to
tell
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would?
i
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
was--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--an
open--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--question,
frankly.
i
mean,
i
can't
imagine
california
would
do
this,
but
i
guess
if
california
did
say
that,
"the
period
of
time
between
the
time
you
lost
in
the
district
court
and
the
time
you
filed,
in
every
other
state,
is
30
days,
but,
in
california,
it's
a
reasonable
time.
"
"and
what
we
mean
by
a
3
years,
without
any
excuses.
"
--i
guess,
then,
maybe
the
dissent
in
carey
v.
saffold
would
have
been
right
in
respect
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
have
said
that
that
isn't
pending
under
federal
law,
whether
california
says
it
or
not.
so,
the
role
of
the
federal
law
versus
the
state
law,
i
thought
we
left
open.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
can't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--defer
to
something--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--under
this
statute,
where
congress
wrote
the
word
"pending".
and
i
wouldn't
have
thought
they
did
have
in
mind
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--state
that
says,
"it's
pending,
even
though
you
have
no
excuse
and
didn't
file
anything
for
3
years,
your
appeal.
"
now,
i
haven't
heard
that
fully
briefed
and
so
forth,
so
i
hesitate
to
express
a
final
conclusion
on
it.
but
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--since
it's
never
going
to
come
up,
i
don't
think,
i
don't
know
i
have
to
have
a
final
conclusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that's
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
many
cases
are
there
on
habeas
in
california
every
year,
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
mean
about.
just
give
me
the
rough
ballpark.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
the...
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
there
are
25...
so
there
are
several
thousand
cases
every
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
thousands.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so,
i
don't
know
what
i'm
doing
with
california
procedure
when
i
pass
a...
pass
a
law,
is
what
it
would
be.
write
a
rule,
write
a
presumption.
i
have
no
idea
what
i'm
doing
there.
they've
worked
out
a
system.
but
i
don't...
why
doesn't
it
work
just
to
say
to
the
lower
courts,
"do
your
job"?
what
we
said...
and
maybe
it
wasn't
expressed
clearly...
maybe...
"courts,
look,
it
says
"reasonable
time"?
"
"now,
reasonable
time,
in
every
other
state
is
30
days,
sometimes
20
days.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"sometimes
the
most,
60
days.
"
"so,
look
and
see
if
it
was
filed
within
a
reasonable
time.
"
"that's
all.
"
"and
if
california
passes...
some
specific
thing
says
something
special
about
it,
of
course,
pay
attention
to
that.
"
what's
wrong
with
that?
they
just
would
do
it
like
they
do
any
other
thing
of
deciding
what
happens
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
that
is
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
now,
maybe
i'm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
the
difficulty
of
looking
to
that,
which
may
be
a
good
difficulty...
i
mean,
that
is
a
serious
problem,
but
i
thought
what
we
wrote
in
the
case...
see,
there
are
two
problems
here.
first,
which
was
bothering
me,
had
to
do
with
our
court's
relation
to
the
ninth
circuit,
which
may
be
simple
and...
as
far
as
legally
is
concerned...
but
i'm
not
sure
about
it.
the
other,
which
is
much
more
interesting,
is
what
you're
talking
about.
all
right,
now,
on
the
first
one,
i
read
the
words.
it
says
the
words
"on
the
merits".
the
ninth
circuit
thought
those
three
words
meant
that
the
california
supreme
court
could
not
have
considered
the
petition
too
late,
for,
after
all,
it
decided
it
on
the
merits,
just
as
with
the
cite.
now,
whether
these
words
are
right
or
wrong
that
follow,
that's
what
we
wrote.
the
next
words
were,
"there
are
many
plausible
answers
to
this
question.
"
sometimes,
a
court
addresses
the
merits
of
a
claim
that
it
thought
was
presented
in
an
untimely
way.
why?
because
they
don't
present
any
difficulty,
and
the
timeliness
issue
does,
or
because
it
wants
to
give
the
reviewing
court
alternative
grounds
for
decision,
or
maybe
it
just
wants
to
show
the
prisoner
we
thought
about
the
claim
on
the
merits.
he,
after
all,
doesn't
have
a
lawyer.
he
gets
a
postcard.
that
helps
him.
so,
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons.
and
it
says,
"conclusion".
given
the
variety
of
reasons
why
they
might
have
put
the
words
"on
the
merits",
the
fact
that
they
are
there,
those
words
cannot,
by
themselves,
show
that
the
petition
was
timely.
so,
then
i
read
what
they
wrote.
what
they
wrote
is,
"when
the
california
court
denies
a
habeas
petition
without
comment
or
citation,
we
have
long
treated
the
denial
as
a
decision
on
the
merits.
"
okay?
and
then
it
cites
a
pre
carey
case.
"therefore,
the
summary
denial
was
on
the
merits,
and
the
petition
was
not
dismissed
as
untimely.
"
citing
two
pre
carey
cases.
now,
i
don't
see
how,
since
i
just
said
the
words
"on
the
merits
do
not
end
the
issue.
"
--here,
the
words
weren't
even
there,
but
they
say,
"we're
treating
it
as
if
they
were,
and
that
ends
the
issue.
"
so,
what
do
we
do
about
that?
then
the
next
question,
once
i
figure
that
one
out,
is,
what
do
we
do
about
the
issue
you're
raising,
which
is
quite
important
and
interesting
and
so
forth?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
could
work
with
that.
now,
that's,
sort
of,
helpful,
because
if
they
say
"most
are
timely
filed",
then
the
next
question
would
be,
"all
right,
what
period
of
time
is
it?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you'd
have
to
get
some
professor
to
go
through
these
cases,
and
they
could...
they
could
figure
out
how
long
it
is.
what
do
you
think
it
is,
from
your
experience?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
i
mean,
is
it
more
like
a
month,
or
is
it
more
like
3
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
there's
a
special
reason.
in
your
case,
is
there
really
a
year
that
isn't
explained
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
forget
that.
the
library,
i'll
give
you.
what's
the
rest?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
well,
did
your...
did
your
client
file
an
affidavit
or
something
saying
he
didn't
have
access
to
the
library
during
the
whole
period
of
3
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
says,
during
the
year
after
they
said,
"we'll
change
your
job
so
you
can
get
access
to
the
library.
"
that
he
didn't
have
access
to
the
library?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right,
so
what's
his
reason
for
saying
that,
"last
year,
i
was
not
able
to
file
a
petition
in
california
supreme
court?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
does
it
say?
what
does
he
say?
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
next
thing,
what
he
actually
says
here,
is
that
the
c
facility
where
he
was
confined
was
put
into
lockdown
clearly
into
february
1997.
and
this
is
all
after
he
got
access.
then
it
remained
quiet
and
lockdown
free
until
august
11th,
1997.
so,
that
seems
six
months,
on
the
most
generous
interpretation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
he's
not
in
lockdown,
and
he
has
access
to
the
library.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
about
six
months.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
here
we
have
180
days...
180
days,
twice
90...
with
no
excuse
at
all
presented.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
this?
you
might
lose
under
this,
but
it...
see,
so
you
say...
look,
in
every
other
state,
the
time
for
appealing
from
an
appeals
court
to
the
state
supreme
court,
asking
them,
is
20
days,
normally,
or
sometimes
30.
so,
if
the
ninth
circuit
gets
a
case
in
which
it
was
longer
than
30
days,
then,
irrespective
of
whether
they
say
"on
the
merits",
whether
they
cite
a
case,
whether
they
don't
say
anything
and
just
have
a
postcard,
what
the
ninth
circuit
should
assume
that
they've
done
is
consider
it
untimely,
in
the
absence
of
the
kind
of
excuse
that
the
california
courts
might
accept
as
an
excuse.
so,
then
they'll
look
into
that.
and
if
california,
in
the
future,
wants
something
different...
which
i'd
be
surprised...
they
will
say
that
their
system
means
that
a
3
year
delay,
or
whatever
it
is,
is
actually
timely.
but,
in
the
absence
of
some
reason
to
think
that,
why
not
use
the
words,
which
would
give
you
a
chance
to
go
back,
and
you
could
say,
"this
is
not
a
case
of
total
lack
of
excuse.
"
"there
is
excuse
of
the
kind
that
california
would
accept.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
we
decided...
i'd
like
you
to
suggest
something
to...
from
putting
yourself
in
the...
in
an
imaginary
position.
carey
versus
saffold
did
have
a
dissent.
and
four
justices
joined
it.
and
let's
imagine
that,
when
i
read
the
dissent,
i
see
the...
and
then
i
look
at
this
case...
i
see
imaginary
words
on
the
top
of
the
dissent,
which
are,
"we
told
you
so".
[laughter]
and...
now,
therefore,
think
not
of
if
you
were
arguing
carey
v.
saffold
afresh,
but
think
of
the
words
that
are
actually
written
there.
and
now
think
of
what
happened
here.
and
now
propose
something,
please,
that
will,
in
fact,
deal
with
the
problem
that
this
case
seems
to
present.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
180
days
from
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
you
file--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
reply
brief
in
the
lower
court.
maybe
the
judge
will
take
4
months
to
decide
it.
what's
the
relation?
i
don't
understand
that.
or
maybe
it'll
take--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--2
days--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
decide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
what
would
the
theory
be?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
a
judge...
you
file
it.
on
day...
what...
you
file
it
on
april
1st,
and
then
the
judge
decides
it
in
august.
or
september.
and
now
it's
only
3
days
before
the
6
months...
you
have
to
file
your
appeal,
like,
in
3
days.
that
wouldn't
make
sense.
and
the
congress
would
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
can't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--file
an--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--appeal
before...
oh,
maybe
you
can
in
california.
you're
going
to
file
the
appeal
before
the
lower
court
decides
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even...
or
even
before
they
get
a
lower
court
decision.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't,
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
don't,
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
often--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you,
as
the
attorney
general,
what
period
of
time
after
the
district
courts
made
a
decision,
and
now...
they've
now
filed
their
claim
in
the
court
of
appeals...
how
long
is
it
before
you
say
it's
untimely?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
known
as
aedpa,
says
a
state
prisoner
who
wants
to
file
a
federal
habeas-corpus
petition
has
to
do
so
within
a
year
of
the
time
that
his
state
conviction
became
final.
now,
that
year
can
be
tolled,
you
can
add
days
and
you
are
supposed
to
add
days
for
the
period
during
which
the
petitioner’s
state
habeas
petitions
were
pending.
well,
what’s
“pending”?
in
a
case
called
carey
v.
saffold,
we
said,
well,
pending
time
includes
the
time
between
the
lower
court
deciding,
no,
you
lose,
and
the
petitioner
filing
an
appeal.
that
is
usually
a
few
days,
30
days,
60
days;
states
set
time
limits
as
to
how
long
before
you
have
to
file
that
notice
of
appeal.
and
in
carey
v.
saffold,
we
said
three
things.
we
said
that
time
does
count;
that
is
part
of
the
time
it’s
pending,
those
30
or
60
days
during
which
you’re
just
trying
to
decide
whether
to
appeal.
and
the
second
thing
we
said
--
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
california.
now,
california
is
a
little
difficult
in
this
respect,
as
it
does
not
say
30
days;
it
does
not
say
you
have
to
file
in
60
days.
it
says
you
have
to
file
within
a
reasonable
time.
but
we
said
despite
the
use
of
those
words
“reasonable
time”,
we
think
california
is
about
the
same
as
the
rest
of
the
states,
so
that
time
counts
as
long
as
your
file
within
a
reasonable
time.
you
have
to
be
timely.
and
then
the
third
thing
we
said
is,
well,
federal
judges,
when
you
look
to
see
if
it
is
timely,
sometimes
the
petitioner
files
very
late,
and
the
california
courts
consider
the
matter
and
they
say
denied
on
the
merits;
but
the
fact
that
they
use
the
word
“on
the
merits”
does
not
show
it
was
timely,
because
sometimes
court
to
do
say
“denied
on
the
merits,”
though
it
was
not
timely,
either;
and
they
want
to
show
the
petitioner,
for
example,
he
just
didn’t
lose
on
a
technicality.
all
right,
that
is
what
we
held
in
carey
v.
saffold.
now,
in
this
case,
the
9th
circuit
had
a
petition,
it
was
delayed
and
so
forth,
and
they
had
to
decide
was
this
year
period
as
extended
by
the
pending
time,
did
it
count,
and
it
all
turned
on
the
period
of
time
between
the
lower
court
deciding,
petitioner,
you
lose,
and
his
filling
what
was,
in
effect,
a
notice
of
appeal.
well,
that
turned
out
to
be
three
years.
so
the
9th
circuit
said,
well,
it
is
three
years;
but
that
is
timely,
that
is
within
a
reasonable
time.
and
the
reason
that
they
gave
was,
they
said,
well,
when
the
california
court
finally
denied
the
petition,
it
just
said
“denied”;
but
we
think
it’s
just
saying
“denied”
means
they
denied
it
on
the
merits,
and
if
they
denied
it
on
the
merits,
it
must
have
been
timely.
well,
california
said
that
is
contrary
to
your
case
of
carey
v.
saffold,
and
after
looking
at
it
carefully,
we
think
it
is
contrary
to
the
case
of
carey
v.
saffold;
and
so
we
reverse
the
9th
circuit.
also,
we’ve
looked
out
the
period
of
time
there
and
we’ve
looked
at
the
record,
and
we
do
not
see
any
way
in
which
a
court
consistent
with
saffold
could
say
this
was
timely.
those
are
the
reasons
we
reversed
the
9th
circuit,
and
justice
stevens
has
filled
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
