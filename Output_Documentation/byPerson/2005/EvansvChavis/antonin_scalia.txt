scalia
isn't
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--worse
than
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
well
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
case
is
different,
actually,
from
the
one
that
justice
breyer
put,
because,
in
this
case,
the
california
supreme
court
didn't
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--"#
on
the
merits".
it
said
nothing
at
all.
it
just
disposed
of
it.
so,
the
question
presented
is
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
whether...
not
whether
it
can
be,
nonetheless,
timely
when
they
say
"on
the
merits",
but
whether
it
can
be,
nonetheless,
timely
when
they
don't
say
anything
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
it's
an
a
fortiori
case,
in
other
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
our
current
law,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
would
it?
because
even
if
they
sent
the
"on
the
merits"
postcard,
carey
versus
saffold
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
this
case,
in
order
to
determine
it
was
untimely,
they
would
have
presumably
had
to
have
gone
into
the
factual
analysis
of
whether
the
prison
was
on
lockdown,
whether
he
delayed
for
a
year
after
getting
the
materials,
and
all
of
that
stuff.
so,
it's
a
lot
easier
for
them,
when
the
merits
of
it
seem
to
them
absolutely
clear,
to
simply
deny
it
on
the
merits
and
not
reach
the
"timely"
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
"timely"
question
is
still
before
federal
courts.
that's
what
we
said
in
carey
versus
saffold.
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--although
they
can
avoid
it,
we
can't.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
phrase
it
as
a
presumption?
why
not
phrase
it,
"we
determine
california
law
to
be,
unless
we
hear
otherwise,
having
examined
what
it
does
in
other
situations,
that
60
days
is
timely?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
same
thing.
but
i
wouldn't
call
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
presumption.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
then
the...
you
know,
the
incarcerated
individual
can
come
forward
with
excuses
and
say
that,
"california
would
make
an
exception
to
the
60
day
rule
for
this.
"
and
we're
back
where
we
were.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
"reasonable
time"
the
issue,
or
is
it
what
california
would
consider
a
"reasonable
time"?
i
mean,
that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--making
up,
for
ourselves,
what's
a
reasonable
time.
if
california
says
a
year
is
a
reasonable
time,
that
would
be
the
reasonable
time
at
issue,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
california
supreme
court
says,
"despite
all
of
these,
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
we
think
a
year
is
a
reasonable
time--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
know,
but
if
they
said
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
would
be
binding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
us,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
a
case
that
was
a
procedural
bar
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
could
summarily
deny
and
cite
a
case
that
showed
you
were
denying
on
the
merits.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
they
cited
a
procedural
bar
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
the
most
reasonable
presumption?
why
isn't
the
most
reasonable
presumption
that
the
california
court
denies,
for
untimeliness,
wherever
that
issue
is
absolutely
clear--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
where
that
issue
is
not
absolutely
clear,
and
the...
and
the
merits
issue
is
absolutely
clear,
it
just...
it
just
denies?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
want
to
say
"denied
on
the
merits",
because
that
would
suggest
that
it
was
timely.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
it...
51
percent.
i
mean,
among
those
that
you
don't
know
whether
it
was
the
merits
or
not,
there
could
be
a
lot
of
ones
where
the
timeliness
is
simply
not
decided
upon.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
burden--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
that
one
is
on
him.
i
mean,
if
you
say
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
come
up
with
a...
you
know,
showing
that
there
was
such
a
system,
they
came
up
with
it.
and
you
say,
"the
system
may
have
been
amended.
"
well,
if
it
has
been
amended,
there
the
burden
is
on
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
isn't.
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
mean
if
you
go
in
and
you
say,
90
days,
and
you
bring
in
no
evidence
whatever
of
any
excuse
for
being
over
90
days,
you're
telling
me
that
california
supreme
court
would
accept
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
it
is
a
presumption--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
if
it's
over
90
days,
unless
you
have
a
reason,
it's
untimely.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
one
aspect
of
saffold
that
you
haven't
addressed.
we
not
only
said
what
we
said
about
they're
saying
ca9
case
from
2001.
and
we
cited
that
as
an
example
of
how
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
quote,
"risks
the
tolling
of
the
federal
limitations
period
even
when
it
is
highly
likely
that
the
prisoner
failed
to
seek
timely
review
in
the
state
appellate
courts.
"
close
quote.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
the
ninth
circuit
here
simply
have
ignored
that
criticism
of
exactly
what
they
did
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
didn't
cite
the
en
banc
decision.
we
cited
the
panel
decision--
justice
antonin
scalia
--didn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
after.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
point
is,
we
criticized
the
panel
decision
in
welch,
which
did
exactly
what
this
panel
did
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
cited--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
for
the
proposition
that
it...
as
an
example
of
how
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
quote,
"risks
the
tolling
of
the
federal
limitations
period
even
when
it
is
highly
likely
that
the

failed
to

review
in
the
state
appellate

"
that's
what
we
cited.
