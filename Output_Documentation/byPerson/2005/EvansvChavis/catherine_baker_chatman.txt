ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
court
below
was
wrong,
for
three
reasons.
it
adopted
a
rule
that
frustrates
congress's
intent
to
protect
federal
courts
from
hearing
stale
claims
and
to
respect
the
finality
of
state
court
convictions.
it
does
so
by
improperly
and
arbitrarily
adopting
a
conclusive
presumption
that
misunderstands
or
ignores
state
law
and
practice.
and
it
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
carey
versus
saffold.
if
the
federal
courts,
on
the
other
hand,
complete
their
analysis
of
the
federal
question
of
tolling
the
aedpa
statute
of
limitations
by
deciding
whether
a
state
petition
was
timely
before
granting
tolling,
it
can
properly
dismiss
more
federal
petitions
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds
and
can
avoid
litigating
stale
claims
on
the
merits.
any
difficulties
in
doing
so
can
be
ameliorated
by
the
limited
nature
of
the
state
law
inquiry
and
adoption
of
a
60-day
presumption
of
timeliness.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
the
60
days?
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
well,
justice
ginsburg,
when
california
does
look
to
timeliness
in
proceeding
from
one
lower
court
to
a
higher
court,
then
we
see
that
it
contemplates
that
a...
that
a
litigant
will
proceed
in
60
days
or
less,
because...
and
the
reason
we
have
to
turn
to
analogies
is
because
nothing
in
california
law
requires
the
appellate
courts
in
state
habeas
to
look
to
that
particular
period
of
time
between
the
lower
court
decision
and
proceeding
to
that
court,
because
they're
courts
of
original
jurisdiction.
so,
they
look
at
how
long
the
prisoner
proceeded
from
conviction
to
their
court,
as
a
whole.
but
the
reason
that
we
need
to
figure
out
this
period
is
because
this
court,
in
carey
versus
saffold,
has
said
that
our
system
functions
enough
like
an
appellate
system
to
bring
those
periods
into
the
tolling
provision.
so,
when--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--we
look--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--up
to
this
point,
they
have
not
done
so.
and
i
think
that
is
because,
as
i
said,
they
are
looking
at
the
time
from
conviction.
how
long
did
it
take
the
prisoner
to
get
to
their
court
with
their
claims?
and
how...
and
how
long
they
take
properly
proceeding
up
the
ladder
through
the
courts
is
just
one
factor
that
they
look
at.
and
they--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--i'm
sorry,
how
the
3
year
delay
happened?
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
correct.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
and
there
was
an
equitable--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--tolling
question.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
right.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
yes.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
justice--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
justice
breyer,
i
could
not
agree--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--with
you
more.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
no,
we
did
not.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
the--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--this
is
not
the
first
time
that
we
have
tried
to
take
that
approach
with
the
ninth
circuit
on
this
issue.
they...
on
remand,
in
saffold
versus
carey,
they
made
the
same
mistake,
and
the
rehearing
has
got
us
nowhere...
asking
for
a
rehearing.
and
so,
we
felt
that
in
order
to
get
this
clarified
as
soon
as
possible,
it
seems
futile
to
ask
for
rehearing
when
on
the...
when
we
had
not
been
successful
before.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
this
is,
by
the
way--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
but--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--and
the
ninth
circuit
is
treating
it
as
if
it
were
the
same
sort
of
decision
that
was
before
this
court
in
carey
versus
saffold.
it
is
a
decision
on
the
merits.
and
they
are
reading
that
as
excluding
any
other
possible
grounds
that
might
have
existed
for
the
denial
in
that
case.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
yes.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
to
instruct
the
federal
courts
that,
when
they're
undertaking
this
inquiry
of
whether
an
application
is
pending
during
the
interval,
a
federal
question
that
has
a
state
law
component,
then
they
must
apply
the
state
law
to
figure
out
if
it's
timely.
and,
you
know,
as
this
court
said
in
carey
the...
versus
saffold...
it's
a
matter
of
whether
it's
timely;
it's
not
a
matter
of
the
basis
of
the
state
court
decision.
and
in
the
context
of
california,
i
think
the
answer
is
to
adopt
a
presumption
of
60
days,
because
that
is
the
most
analogous--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
this
is
an
easy
decision
for
the
federal
court,
even
on
these
facts.
okay,
this
petitioner
has
taken
longer
than
60
days,
and
he's
offered
an
explanation.
but
if
you
look
at
his
explanation,
on
its
face,
it's
completely
inadequate
to
account
for
a
3-year
delay,
because
he
doesn't
take
action
to
get...
to
get
library
access
for
an
entire
year
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
denying
his
application
is
issued.
then
he
spends
3
months,
quite
correctly,
going
through
the
administrative
procedures
of
the
prison
to
get
a
job
change.
and
he
does,
in
fact,
get
a
job
change
3
months
later...
about
3
months
later.
then,
he
waits
still
more
than
another
year
before
he
files
his
petition
in
the
california
supreme
court
presenting
essentially
the
same
claims,
same
facts,
same
law.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
yes,
he
does.
now,
he--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--later
on--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--later
on,
once
he
gets
to
federal
court--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--he
offers
the
explanation
that
the
prison
was
on
lockdowns.
there
are
several
problems
with
that
assertion;
the
first
being,
it
wasn't
presented
to
the
state
court,
so
it's...
it
cannot
cure
his
state
untimeliness.
the
second
being
that
he
doesn't
offer
specific
dates
or
explain
how
it
prevented
him
from
filing
his
petition.
and
the
third
problem
is
that
state
prisons
provide
procedures
during
lockdowns
to
get
library
materials
to
prisoners.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
the
problem
with
that
is...
certainly,
it
would
solve
things,
but
the
problem
with
that
is,
it
would
require
the...
require
the
california
courts
to
make
both
of
those
determinations
in
every
case.
and,
as
it
is
now,
they
use
a
procedure
much
like--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--they
could
do
that--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--correct.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
that's
true.
and
that
is
why
i
say
they
would
have
to
make
both
determinations,
because--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--that's
true,
but
we
are...
we
are
engaging
here
in
trying
to
tell
the
california
state
courts
how
to
dispose
of
these
cases,
which
i
am
really
not
sure
is
an
appropriate
thing
for
us
to
do.
they're--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--using
a--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--procedure--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--if
they
were
to
do
that.
but
i
don't
anticipate
the
state
courts
adopting
that
practice,
because
it
would
double
their
work.
they
would
have
to
make
both
decisions,
merits
and
untimeliness.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
it--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--but
the--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--and
that--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--i
agree.
and
they--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--and
that...
and
that
is
the
way
the
state
courts
are
approaching
these
cases.
they,
for
the
most
part,
will
look
first
for
a
prima
facie
case,
and
in...
much
like
the
federal
courts
do
in
federal
habeas
under
rule
4,
where
they
scream
for
frivolous
petitions
that
can
be
dismissed
outright
without
asking
for
a
response
from
the
warden
or
instituting
briefing,
then
they
can
deny
those
summarily.
and
the
reason
why
they
cannot
justify
timeliness
is
because
then
the
ninth
circuit
will
interpret
that
as
not
reaching
the
merits,
and
we
will
have
a
problem
of
deference.
so,
if
they
were
to
decide
one
explicitly,
they'd
have
to
decide
the
other,
the
way
things
stand
now.
and
i--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--as
a--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--it
would,
but
it's
not
a
state
law
question.
they
don't...
whether
it's
pending
during
that
period
is
not
a--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--state
law--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--question,
because--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--whether
he
took
a
reasonable
time
from
the
lower...
from
time
of
conviction
to
their
court
is
the
only
state
law
question--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--because
of
the--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--original--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--i
have--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--i
have
only
seen
one
case
in
california
where
they
specifically
addressed
that
particular
interval
because
the
attorney
general
raised
it,
and
that's
the
moss...
in
re
moss,
which
is
cited
in
the
red
brief.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
yes,
because
the
state
court
found
it
timely,
and
that
would
be--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--that
would
be--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--the
end
of--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--the
matter.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
if--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--i
think
this
court,
in
carey
versus
saffold,
and
in
pace
versus
diguglielmo,
has
stressed
the
importance
of
deferring
to
state
law
determinations--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--state
court--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--determinations.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
well,
it's--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--i
don't
think
so.
but
it's
pending...
it's
pending
while...
if
it's
timely
under
state
law.
and
if
the
state
court
has
already
spoken
to
state
law,
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
question
left
for
the
federal
court.
i
think...
i
think
they
say,
"okay,
this
was
timely,
and,
therefore,
pending
during
the
interval.
"
but--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--no,
it
does--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--not,
but--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--where
that
comes
from
is,
if
you
look
to
the
closest
analogous
state
procedures...
say,
direct
appeal
from
a
conviction...
then
you're
allowed
60
days
to
go
to
the
next...
to
the
appellate
court.
similarly,
if
the
state
appeals
the
grant
of
habeas
relief...
the
state,
unlike
the
defendant,
can
appeal...
then
the
state
gets
60
days.
so,
when
california
thinks...
when
california
quantifies
the
concept
of
reasonableness
in
the
appellate
context,
they
do
so
in
terms
of
60
days
or
less.
and
i
say
"or
less",
because
state
habeas
is
actually
supposed
to
be
a
quicker
process
than
the
appellate
process.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
california's
not
going
to
do
that,
because
it's
not
a
state
law
question.
it's
just
not
a
state
law
question.
but
it's...
i
think
it's
acceptable
for
a
federal
court
to
adopt
a
presumption
to
assist
them
in
deciding
a
state
law
issue,
much--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--the
way.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
the
value
of
a
60-day
presumption
is
that
it
saves
the
federal
court
from
having
to
look
at
the
state
law
time...
of
the
timeliness
in
that
particular
case
and--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--it
ought--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--well,
that's
true.
but
if
it...
but
if
he
files
within
60
days,
there's
no
need
to
look
further
or
consider
his
argument
regarding
timeliness.
and
the
other
value
in
the
60-day--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
fair.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
well,
that
would
be
fair,
and
it
would
accomplish
the
other
thing
that
i
offered
the
60
day
presumption
to
accomplish,
is
to
offer
a
sort
of
safe
harbor
where
the
petitioner
knows
that
he
gets
tolling
for
60
days,
and
need
not
file
a
protective
petition.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
so,
it
alleviates
that
problem.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
well--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--well,
justice
souter,
i
think
it
works
very
well
as
a
presumption
adopted
by
the
federal
courts
for
ease
of
administrability
and,
you
know,
at
the
same
time,
reflecting
state
law.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
but
the--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--right.
but--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--but
the
one
thing--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--well,
it's
not
very
different
from
when
the
federal
courts
adopt
a
state
statute
of
limitations--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--for
a
federal--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--cause
of
action.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
well--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--by
analogy,
you
know
that
the
period
of
time
for
seeking
direct
appeal
is
60
days.
so,
it
is...
it's
deciding
something
by
analogy,
in
much
the
same
way
the
federal
courts
do
for
a
federal
cause
of
action
that
has
no
statute
of
limitations.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
oh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
i
would...
there
are
about
8,000,
i
would
say.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
no.
in
the
supreme
court,
i
would
say
it
is
more
like
about
2500.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
thousands.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
thousands.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
that
is...
that
is
exactly
what
i
would
ask
this
court
to
do.
exactly...
is
to...
federal
courts
take
on
this
federal
question
of
tolling
and
complete
the
analysis
by
applying
state
law
to
find
out
if
these
petitions
were
timely
filed
in
merit
tolling.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
it--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--i
don't
think
it
would
be,
in
light
of--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--in
light
of
the
analogous
state
law
that
you
only
get
60
days
to--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--appeal,
but--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--but
they--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--haven't
said
so.
the...
of
course,
you--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--if
they
said
so--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--if
they
had--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--if
they
said
so,
then
we'd
have
state
law,
and
we
would
have
to
apply
that.
but
we
don't.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
of...
certainly
it
is.
certainly
it
is.
but,
at
the
end
of
the
analysis,
there
is
a
little
bit
of
state
law
analysis.
it
has
to
be
timely
under
state
law.
and
if
california
supreme
court
tells
us
more
about
what's
timely
under
their
reasonableness
standard,
then
i
think
you
would
have
to
take
that
into
account.
but
the
concept
of
reasonableness
and
due
diligence
that
are
employed
in
states...
in
california's
timeliness
standards,
i
don't
think
"reasonableness"
and
"due
diligence"
mean
anything
different
at
the
federal
courthouse
in
sacramento
than
they
do
at
the
state
court
of
appeal
five
blocks
away,
or
in
this
court.
it's...
these
are
common
terms
that
are
used
in
the
law
all
the
time.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
your
honor,
yes,
we
have
suggested
that.
the
california
supreme
court...
and,
as
you
said,
this
is
not
within
the
record...
the
california...
but,
if
i
may,
the
california
supreme
court
has
declined
to
adopt
a
rule.
they
think
it's
a
political
question
that
has
to
be
decided
by
the
legislature.
and
the
legislature,
to
date,
has
not
adopted
a
rule
or...
not
a
rule,
a
statute
of
limitations
for
these
cases.
and
i
have
to
say
that,
if
they
undertook
that,
then
there
would
be
certain
costs
to
doing
that,
as
well.
you
know,
we
would...
we
would...
we
would
ease
this
issue,
but
we
would
confront
the
cost
of
considerable
litigation,
i
would
imagine,
if
we
adopted
a
new
statute
for
collateral
relief
in
california.
so,
there's
a
cost
to
doing
that,
that
might
outweigh
the
benefits
of--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--clarifying
this
issue.
if
i
may
reserve
my
time?
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
thank
you.
of
course
there's
a
federal
interest
at
stake
here.
it's
the
federal
interest
in
the
federal
courts
not
having
to
deal
with
stale
habeas
claims
in
federal
court.
one
thing
i'd
like
to
address
is
the
capital
case
presumption,
which
is
now...
excuse
me...
180
days.
it's
been
changed
from
90
days.
that
presumption
is
for...
from
the
filing
of
the
reply
brief
to
filing
an
initial
petition
in
california
court.
that
is,
your
first
habeas
petition.
they...
you
only
get
presumed
timely
for
180
days.
here,
we're
talking
about
noncapital
cases
going
just
from...
taking
claims,
that
have
already
been
presented
in
one
petition,
to
the
next
level.
so,
in
those--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--from
the
filing
of
the...
the
final
due
date
of
the
filing
of
the
reply
brief--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--in
the
direct
appeal.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
i--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--i
think--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--i
think
they...
i
think
they
date
it
from
the
filing
of
the
reply
brief
because--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--because
they
like
to
see
these
claims
presented
along
with
the
appeal
to
be...
so
that
they
can
possibly
bring
them
together
and
decide
habeas
claims
in
light
of
the
record
on
appeal.
so,
i
think
that's
why
they
date
it
from
filing
of
the
reply
briefs.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
well,
you're
not...
you're
generally
not
supposed
to
be
waiting.
i
mean,
you
were
talking
about
claims
such
as--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--ineffective--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--assistance--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--well,
if
we're
talking
about
capital
cases
here,
they
are...
they
are
filing
their
appeals
directly
in
the
california
supreme
court;
similarly,
with
their
habeas
petitions.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
there
would
be
no
lower
court
decision.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
no.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
no,
no,
no.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
no,
they
go--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--straight
to
california
supreme
court.
which
brings
up
one
point,
which
is
that
the
problem
that
we're
looking
at
here
in
deciding
timeliness
will
not
arise
in
capital
cases.
we
will
not
have
that
problem,
because
capital
cases
go
straight
to
the
california
supreme
court.
there
are
not
going
to
be
intervals
between
the
courts
to
deal
with.
so,
that
simplifies,
i
think,
the
problem
a
little
bit.
the
other
thing
i'd
like
to
address
is
the
argument
that
a
state
court
is
saying
something
with
these
summary
orders.
i
strongly
disagree
with
that.
they
are
absolutely
saying
nothing.
this
court
said
in
ylst
that
the
essence
of
an
unexplained
order
is
that
it
says
nothing.
it
does
not
say,
"this
is
a
timely
petition".
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
that
is...
in
the
california
supreme
court,
you
will
find
that
sometimes,
that
they
will
indicate
untimeliness
by
a
case
citation;
hardly
ever
in
the
lower
appellate
court.
and
i
would
also
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
delay
being
a
problem
going
from
the
lower
appellate
court
to
the
california
supreme
court.
we
see
it
at
both
levels.
and
i
would
also
disagree
that
this
shouldn't
be
a
problem
because
these
petitioners
have
no
incentive
to
delay.
that
may
be
the
case,
that
they
don't
have
an
incentive
to
delay,
but
they
do,
in
fact,
sleep
on
their
rights,
as--
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
--chavis
did.
ms.
catherine
baker
chatman
we
would...
we
would
say
anything
over
60
days.
yes,
your
honor.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
