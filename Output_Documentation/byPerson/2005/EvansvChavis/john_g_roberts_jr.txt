we'll
hear
argument
next
in
evans
versus
chavis.
ms.
chatman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
might--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
was
just
going
to
say,
it
might
matter
if
they
had
another
postcard
that
said
it's
untimely,
and
they
didn't
send
that.
that
would
be
a
whole
different
situation,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--good
would
the...
what
good
would
the
presumption
do
if
it's
just
a
presumption?
presumably,
if
it's
a
presumption,
the
prisoner
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--going
to
say,
"well,
here's
why
you
shouldn't
follow
the
presumption
in
my
case.
"
just
as,
if
it
looks
like
he's
waited
a
long
time,
he's
going
to
say,
"well,
here's
why
that
delay
was
reasonable.
"
i
don't
know
that
the
presumption
you're
proposing
serves
much
of
a
purpose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--not
if
the
prisoner
says,
"here's
why
you
shouldn't
follow
the
presumption.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
you
have
to
apply
that?
it's
a
federal
question
whether
the
claim
is
pending
or
not
during
that
whole
period,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stris.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
can
you...
how
can
you
say
that?
we
do
have
a
federal
rule
and
a
limitation,
and
(d)(2)
is
an
exception
for
time
that
it's
pending
before
the
state
courts.
and
if
the
state
courts
aren't
going
to
bother
to
tell
us
whether
something's
timely
or
not,
or
pending,
giving
them
a
blank
check
does
undermine
the
federal
interest
behind
the
1
year
limitation
period.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
do
you
think
the
federal
statute
necessarily
imports
a
state
standard?
it
says
that
the
state
postconviction
proceeding
must
be
pending.
and
california
presents
an
unusual
situation,
but
we
interpret
that
pending
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
it's
not
a
state
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--mr.
stris.
ms.
chatman,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
ones
that
would
cite
a
case
that
threw
out
the
petition
because
it
was
untimely...
and
we
were
told
there
were
over
a
thousand
of
those
every
year...
that
would
be
saying
something,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
chatman.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
in
evans
versus
chavis.
