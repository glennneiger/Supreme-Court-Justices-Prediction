justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
you
want
us
to
apply
a
presumption
that
a
petition
is
timely
if
it's
filed
within
60
days.
but
california
doesn't
apply
such
a
presumption,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--where
do
we
get
that?
i
mean,
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
shouldn't
we
leave
it
to
california
to
adopt
such
a
presumption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
are
those
standards,
please?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
once
it's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
federal
habeas
context,
the
aedpa
law
suggests
there's
a
great
premium
paid...
at
stake
for
promptly
resolving
these
things.
what
do
we
do
about
that?
this
is
in
the
federal
court
system
now.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
would
we
do
in
that
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--open
to
the
federal
courts.
