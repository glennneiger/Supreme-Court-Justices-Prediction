justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
said...
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
you
said
that
there
was
nothing,
i
think,
as
you
put
it,
in
the
exiting
of
the
water
that
was
significantly
different
that...
or
that
we
could
peg
as
significantly
different.
but
that
seems
to
me
to
be
at
odds
with
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
the
barrel,
because
the
exiting
of
the
water
from
the
barrel
and
the
exiting
of
the
water
from
the
dam
are
exactly
the
same.
and
if
one
is
a
discharge,
i
don't
see
why
the
other
isn't
a
discharge.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
it
isn't
the
exiting
that
you're
getting
at.
and
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
it
seems
to
me...
and
i
don't
want
to
make
a
joke,
but
i
think
you're
on
to
something
when
you
talk
about
the
exiting,
because
the
word
"discharge",
as
we
commonly
use
it,
is
a
word
that
describes
how
you
get
rid
of
something.
and
how
you
get
rid
of
something,
it
seems
to
me,
is
exactly
the
same,
whether
you're
pouring
the
barrel
over
the
bank
or
whether
pouring
the
barrel,
as
it
were,
through
the
turbine
after
impounding
it,
it
is
the...
everybody's
been
quoting
dictionary
definitions...
it's
the
"flowing
out".
the
flowing
out
is
the
same
with
the
barrel
as
it
is
with
the
dam.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
seems
to
me
where
i
have
trouble
with
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
as
i
understand
it,
in
some
or
all
of
these
dams,
at
the
point
of
discharge,
there
isn't
any
river
down
there.
it's
dry.
it's...
the
bed,
in
effect,
has
been
deprived
of
the
river
by
the
impoundment,
so
that
you're
not
simply,
as
it
were,
taking,
you
know,
one
spoonful
out
here
and
dropping
it
into
a
river...
putting
the
spoonful
back
into
a
river
that's
flowing
there,
because
it
isn't
flowing
there,
as
a
result
of
your
dam.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
the
answer
to
your
question
that
a
great
number
of
those
usages
that
you
refer
to
are
uses
that
refer
to
the
discharge
of
pollutants?
and
there
is
a
good...
there
are
good
reasons
in
the
statute...
and
we
have
recognized
them...
to
say
that
when
you
discharge
a
pollutant,
you
are
adding
something
that
wasn't
there
before?
but
when
the
statute,
in
this
case,
is
using
"discharge"
without
a
reference
to
"pollutant",
it
makes
perfectly
good
linguistic
sense
to
construe
it
just
as
the
court
has
done.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
it's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--"#
reinforcing",
and
maybe
it's
"changing".
i
mean,
you're
characterizing
it
one
way.
we
start
with
a
different
canon
of
meaning,
and
that
is
that
we
look
to
the
words
around
which,
in
connection
with
which,
the
word
is
used.
in
here,
it's
being
used
without
certain
modifiers
or
descriptive
conditions.
in
other
cases,
it
is
being
used
with
them.
and
that's
a
good
reason
to
think
that
probably
the
word
is
intended
to
mean
something
different
in
those
situations.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your
argument,
i
thought,
was
simply
this,
that
it
uses
"discharge"
in,
you
know,
x
number...
i
forget
how
many
you
had...
and
it's
perfectly
clear
that
in
most
of
those
instances
it
requires
an
addition;
and,
therefore,
it
should
be
construed
as
requiring
it
here.
my
point
was
that
in
a
great
many
of
those
instances,
the
statute
is
not
merely
using
the
word
in
isolation;
it's
using
it
in
connection
with
a
couple
of
other
words,
like
"discharge
a
pollutant".
and
it,
therefore,
number
one,
makes
sense
to
construe
"discharge
of
a
pollutant"
differently
from
"discharge".
that's
the...
that's
the
only
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
point
is,
you
can't
simply
argue
from
the
fact
that
the
word
occurs
somehow
x
number
of
times
to
the
conclusion
that
it
has
to
mean
the
same
thing
every
time
it's
used.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
that
isn't
what
they
mean.
i
mean,
for
example,
if
somebody
puts
a
stick
in
the
middle
of
the
river,
no
one...
no
one
is
claiming
that
the
water
that
flows
around
the
stick
is
being
discharged.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot...
i
don't
know
whether
anyone
wants
to
put
a
stick
in
the
river,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there
are
things
you
can
do
that
clearly
would
not
activate
the
corps'
interpretation
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
agree
that
if
the...
if
somebody
with
property
on
each
side
wanted
to
build
a
dam...
i'm
sorry,
wanted
to
build
a
bridge
to
connect
his
property,
and
he
needed
to
put
a
post
in
the
middle
of
the
river
to
support
the
bridge,
that
there
would
be
no
discharge
of
water
occasioned
by
putting
the
post
in
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
why,
if...
you
may
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't...
didn't
that
case
involved
the...
a
violation
there...
involve
the
addition
of
a
pollutant?
and
there
was
no
addition
of
a
pollutant,
because
the
water
was
equally
polluted
on
each
side.
wasn't
that
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
i
take
it
your
ultimate
answer
is,
no,
a
state
could
not,
in
effect,
eliminate
hydropower
from--
justice
david
h.
souter
--development.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
interested...
i'm
asking
for
an
answer
to
my
question.
i
take
it,
based
on
your
further
answer
to
justice
alito,
that
your
answer
to
the
first
question
is,
no,
a
state
could
not,
in
effect,
eliminate
all
hydropower
from...
development
from
its
rivers.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
don't
think
there
would
be
any
conflict
with
the
ferc
scheme
if
you
did
that?
you
don't
think
there
would
be
any
conflict
between
the
federal
policy
embodied
in
the
power
act
and
in
the
state
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
miccosukee
was
concerned
not
with
molecules,
but
with
chemical
composition.
the
chemical
composition
was
the
same
in
this
body
and
in
that
body,
and,
in
that
sense,
there
was
no
addition--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine.
s.
d.
warren
operates
several
hydropower
dams
on
the
presumpscot
river
in
maine
to
generate
electricity
for
its
paper
mill.
under
the
federal
power
act,
warren
needs
a
federal
license
to
operate
its
dams,
and
it
sought
to
renew
its
licenses
in
1999.
section
401
of
the
clean
water
act
requires
that
anyone
who
seeks
a
federal
license
to
conduct
any
activity
which
may
result
in
any
discharge
into
the
navigable
waters
shall
provide
certification
from
the
state
in
which
the
discharge
originates,
assuring
that,
among
other
things,
state
water-quality
standards
are
met.
warren
was
granted
its
licenses,
but
subject
to
its
compliance
with
certain
restrictions
mandated
by
the
state.
warren
claims
that
because
its
dams
do
not
add
anything
to
the
river,
they
do
not
result
in
any
discharge
into
it
and
so
do
not
trigger
the
need
for
any
such
certification
from
maine.
the
maine
board
of
environmental
protection
thought
otherwise,
and
warren
brought
this
suit
in
the
state
courts
to
challenge
that
agency’s
decision.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
concluded
that
warren
did
need
to
obtain
a
state
certification
under
section
401
of
the
clean
water
act.
we
granted
certiorari,
and
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
affirm.
the
key
word
in
this
dispute
is
“discharge”,
a
term
that
the
clean
water
act
does
not
define.
the
act
tells
us
that
“discharge”,
when
used
without
qualification,
includes
a
discharge
of
“a
pollutant
and
a
discharge
of
pollutants”;
but
“discharge”
when
used
alone
is
presumably
broader
than
these
included
examples,
and
since
the
broader
term
is
not
defined
by
the
statute,
we
construe
it
in
accordance
with
its
plain
meaning,
which
in
the
context
of
water
means
“flowing
out
or
issuing
out”.
operating
a
dam
obviously
may
cause
a
discharge
of
this
sort.
warren’s
arguments
failed
to
persuade
us
that
“discharge”
should
be
read
differently
from
the
ordinary
way,
invoking
the
statutory
canon
noscitur
a
sociis,
which
reminds
us
that
a
word
is
known
by
the
company
it
keeps.
warren
argues
that
because
the
word
“discharge”
keeps
company
with
the
phrase
“discharge
of
a
pollutant”,
a
phrase
defined
to
require
an
addition
of
something,
then
“discharge”
pure
and
simple
should
also
be
read
to
require
an
addition.
but
we
think
the
statutory
canon
is
out
of
place
here.
noscitur
a
sociis
is
useful
when
several
items
in
a
list
share
a
common
attribute.
but
here,
warren
seeks
to
extrapolate
a
common
feature
from
what
amounts
to
a
list
of
one,
the
word
“discharge
and
other
pollutant”
and
its
plural
variant.
this
defies
general
usage;
giving
one
example
does
not
convert
express
inclusion
into
restrictive
equation.
further,
we
do
no
think
warren’s
interpretation
is
compelled
by
our
prior
decision
in
the
case
of
south
florida
water
management
district
versus
miccosukee
tribe.
miccosukee
addressed
a
different
section
of
the
clean
water
act,
and
it
was
concerned
only
with
whether
an
addition
had
been
made
as
required
by
the
definition
of
the
phrase
“discharge
of
a
pollutant”.
the
fact
that
something
had
to
be
added
to
the
water
in
miccosukee
under
section
402
of
the
act
does
not
answer
the
present
question
of
what
constitutes
a
discharge
into
water
under
section
401.
warren’s
reliance
on
legislative
history
is
also
misplaced,
as
it
actually
underscores
the
fact
that
congress
distinguished
the
term
“discharge”
and
the
term
“discharge
of
pollutants”
deliberately
in
order
to
use
them
in
separate
places
and
to
separate
ends.
finally,
we
note
that
warren
admits
its
dams
create
changes
in
the
river’s
movement
and
flow
that
may
alter
oxygen
levels
and
be
harmful
to
fish
and
eels.
changes
like
this
fall
within
a
state’s
legitimate
legislative
business,
and
congress
passed
the
clean
water
act
intending
to
preserve
the
rights
of
the
states
to
reduce
pollution
within
their
boundaries.
we
thus
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
maine
court
and
find
that
because
a
dam
raises
a
potential
for
a
discharge,
section
401
of
the
clean
water
act
is
triggered,
and
state
certification
is
required.
