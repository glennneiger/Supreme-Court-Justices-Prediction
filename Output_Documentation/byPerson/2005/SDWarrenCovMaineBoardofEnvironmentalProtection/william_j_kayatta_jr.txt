mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it...
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
presumpscot
river
is
a
single
body
of
water,
as
that
term
was
used
in
last
year's
miccosukee
decision.
warren's
position
is
that
the
flowing
of
that
single
body
of
water
through
warren's
five
dams
is
not
a
discharge
into
that
same
single
body
of
water.
in
arguing
that
certification
under
section
401
of
the
clean
water
act
is,
therefore,
not
required,
we
are
not
maintaining
that
the
state
either
has,
or
should
have,
no
voice
on
matters
of
water
quality
in
connection
with
the
relicensing
of
these
dams.
in
1986,
congress
took
care
to
ensure
states
a
forceful,
but
not
controlling,
voice
on
environmental
issues,
including
water
quality
issues,
in
all
hydropower
relicensing
proceedings.
congress
was
very
specific
about
its
intent
in
1986,
and
it
intended
to
give
states
a
strong
voice,
but
not
a
veto.
so,
we
feel
the
case...
that
the
states
clearly
have
that
voice.
now--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes,
that
would
be
a
discharge
into
the
river.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
there
is...
we
draw
a
distinction...
and
i'm
referring
just
to
discharge,
i'm
not
addressing
the
issue
that
the
court
could
get
to
in
another
case
of
whether
you
actually
need
a
discharge
of
a
pollutant,
as
to
just
a
discharge
into
the
river...
we
draw
a
distinction
between
actually
removing
something
entirely
from
the
river,
exercising
control
over
it.
your
hypothetical,
mr.
chief
justice,
had
it
for
5
years.
in
that
situation,
one
could
say
that
there
may
be
a
discharge
into
the
river
when
an
activity
is
proposed
to
pour
that
back
into
the
river.
in
a...
in
the
dams...
the
dams,
the
water
continuously
flows
down.
the
water
never
leaves
the
single
body
of
water
called
the
presumpscot.
and
that's
the
distinction
that
we
would
draw.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
the
dams
slow
down
the
water
as
it
comes
down
the
presumpscot.
and
because
the
dams
slow
down
the
water,
then
the
river
widens
in
an
area
called
an
impoundment
area.
but
the...
there
is
a
continuous
motion
leaving
the
dam
in
the
same
amount
of
water
that
comes
into
the
area
above
the
dam.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
distinction
we
would
draw
would
be
when
the
exercise
over
the
water,
and
the
separation
of
the
water
from
the
river,
reach
the
point
where
it
could
be
said
that
we're
no
longer
dealing
with
one
unitary
body
of
water,
as
that
term
is
defined
in
miccosukee.
if
we--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes.
the...
there
is...
there
is
no
dispute
that
when
one
changes
the
movement
of
water
and
its
flow,
then
characteristics
of
the
water
can
change.
for
example,
in
the
impoundment
area
you
can
have
not
a
change,
overall,
of
temperature,
but
a
stratification
of
warmer
water
going
to
the
top,
colder
water
going
to
the
bottom.
similarly,
you
can
have
changes
in
other
aspects
of
the
water.
all
of
those
have
been
classified
by
the
epa
as
nonpoint
source
pollution.
and
it
is
undisputed
that
401
does
not
cover
nonpoint
source
solution...
pollution.
so--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--the
water,
as
it
comes
into
the
dam
and
in
the
impoundment
area,
there
is
a...
there
are
findings,
that
we
are
not
here
challenging,
that
that
water
changes
as
it
comes
into
the
impoundment
area.
the
discharge
of
that
water...
that
water
then
flows
through
the
dam
on
its
way
down
the
river.
there
is
nothing...
there
is
no
nexus
between
the
water
exiting
the
dam
and
any
of
the
changes
that
your
honor
has
pointed
to.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
we're
saying
that
the
river
flows
continuously
down.
it
changes
at
various
points
as
it
goes
down
a
river.
as
it
goes
through
rapids,
a
river
changes.
the
nature
of
a
river
changes
as
it
goes
over
rapids.
as
it
comes--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--no.
the
character
of
the
water--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--the
water...
take
the...
mr.
chief
justice's
barrel
of
water
that
has
not
been
removed
from
the
river...
it
comes
down
the
river.
it
changes
as
it
goes
down
the
river.
it
is
potentially
changed
in
the
impoundment
area.
it
then
flows
through
the
dam.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
the
same
water
that
went
into
the
dam--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--it's
the
same
water
that
went
into
the
dam
as
comes
out
of
the
dam.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
than
it
was
further--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--up
the
river.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes,
you
are.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
the
difference,
we
would
say,
is
that,
in
the
barrel
hypothetical,
the
water
has
been...
the
water
that
is
put
into
the
river
from
the
barrel
that
has
been
in
someone's
garage
for
5
years--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--well,
we--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--the
difference--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes,
justice
souter.
the
difference
is
the
"discharge
into".
to
have
something
"discharge
into
the
river",
you
need
something
different
than
the
river
to
go
into
the
river.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
but
the...
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
the
river
is
divided
into
two
different
things,
then
you
can
start
to
talk
about
a
discharge
of
one
thing
into
the
other.
but
miccosukee
makes
clear
that
the
structure
of
a
dam
does
not
keep
us
from
viewing
this
as
a
single
body
of
water
which
flows
through
a
dam.
it
does
not
flow
"into
the
navigable
waters";
the
navigable
waters
themselves
flow
through
the
dam.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes.
and,
again,
we
don't
dispute
that
there
are
nonpoint
source
changes
in
the
water
as
it
flows
down
the
river,
before
it
goes
through
the
dam.
the
water
that
then
goes
in
and
emits--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes.
the...
it
is
the
impoundment
that
changes
the
nature
of
the
water.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
the
release
simply
continues
the
flow
of
that
water,
albeit
however
it
has
been
changed
by
mechanisms
other
than
discharges
into
the
river.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
the
consistent
position
of
the
epa
all
along
has
been
that
401
requires
a
discharge
from
a
point
source
before
it
applies.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
no.
epa
is
claiming
that
the
discharge
from
a
point
source
occurs
as
the
water
exits
the
dam--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--not
in
the--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--impoundment.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
the...
401
is
a
triggering,
or
a
threshold
determination,
as
set
forth
in
one
of
this
court's
prior
decisions,
that
gives
the
state
not
just
a
voice,
but
essentially
a
mandatory
veto
over
a
very
broad
area.
the
question
in
this
case
is,
have
we
triggered...
have
we
stepped
over
that
threshold?
the
point
that
there
is
no
disagreement
between
the
parties
on
is
that
to
step
over
that
threshold,
to
trigger
401,
one
has
to
have
a
discharge
into
the
navigable
waters--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--no,
their
position
is
precisely
that
the
water
is
running
into
the
water.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes.
let
me
refer
to
the
purpose.
there's...
as
is
always
the
case,
there
are
general
pronouncements
about
purpose.
and
the
respondents
have
taken
those
general
pronouncements
to
basically
say,
"anything
that
allows
the
states
greater
control
or
improvement
over
water
quality
is
the
direction
in
which
the
statute
should
be
interpreted,
to
achieve
that
general
purpose.
"
however,
we
know
that,
notwithstanding
the
general
purposes,
that
congress,
when
it
turned
to
approve
specific
words
in
401,
did
not
simply
say
"anything
that
affects
water
quality".
it
divided
a
line.
and
that
line,
for
example,
means
that
federal
permits
for
grazing,
or
federal
permits
for
logging
roads,
do
not
trigger
401;
and
they
do
not
trigger
it,
because
there
is
no
discharge
from
a
point
source.
so,
we
know
a
line
has
been
drawn
by
congress
in
pursuit
of
its
purpose,
as
compared
to
other
goals
that
congress
has
in
mind.
the
question
is,
where
was
that
line
drawn?
we
think
you
look
to
the
statute
to
see
where
that
was
drawn,
and
it
was
"discharge
into
the
navigable
waters".
otherwise,
what
we're
left
with
is,
we're
left
with
trying
to,
sort
of,
almost
metaphysically
think
of
the
water
discharge...
the
same
water
discharging
into
the
same
water
in
order
to
reach
a
conclusion
that
the
real
way
you
should
read
the
statute
is
just
as
if
it
says,
"if
one
does
anything
at
all
to
the
water,
you
need
to
get
certification.
"
and
we
don't
think
it
says
that.
it
would--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--the--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
actually,
the
record
here
would
indicate
that
that...
that
could
happen
with
some
eels,
not
salmon.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
so,
your
point
is
well
taken,
justice
stevens.
the
fish
that,
as
the
water
flows
through
the
dam,
may
be
killed
by
coming
in
contact
with,
and
getting
hit
by,
the
turbine,
are
not
discharged
into
the
water;
they're
in
the
water
as
it
goes
into
the
dam,
they're
killed
as
it
goes
through
the
dam,
they
remain
in
the
water.
the
dam
discharges
nothing.
it
puts
nothing--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--into
the
river.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
think
that--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--exactly.
and
we
would--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--i
think
they
could...
i'm
not
sure
they
could
word
it
that
way,
but
they
could
effectively...
ferc
could
effectively
do
it.
in
effect,
congress
has
told
ferc
that
in
a...
in
a
federal...
in
a
ferc
proceedings,
it
not
only
has
to
listen
to
the
state,
but
it
has
to
give
considerable
consideration
to
the
state's
arguments.
and
it
has
to--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--that's
correct.
and
it's
a
very
substantial
issue,
because
essentially
what
ferc
proceedings
are...
under
the
hydropower
sections
of
ferc,
essentially
what
they
are
is
environmental
proceedings,
where
there's
a
determination
made
about
water
quality
issues
that
are
then
balanced
off
against
energy
issues.
if
the...
under
prior
interpretations,
the
401
powers
have
become
quite
robust.
if
we
now
take
the
threshold
of
ferc
proceedings
essentially
will
be
a
mail
office,
where
they
receive
the
conditions
from
the
state
and
have
no
choice
but
to
file
them...
follow
them.
our
position
is
that
congress
intended
to
leave
some
room--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--that's
correct.
it
would
have
a
uniform
national
energy
and
environmental
policy,
in
that
respect.
and
we
believe
that...
congress,
in
'86,
clearly
thought
that's
what
we
had.
that's
the...
it
would
make
no
sense,
in
congress
in
'86,
to
order
ferc
to
give
weight
to
what
the
states
say
in
these
situations
if
what
we're
now
told
is,
"congress
was
wasting
time,
because
the
states
already
had
a
mandatory
veto
on
all
of
these
issue...
issues
in
every
single
situation
with
respect
to
every
single
hydropower
licensing--
"
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--"#
proceeding".
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
there
was
some
concern
prior
to
'86
by
congress
that
ferc
was
doing
just
that.
and
that's
why
congress
told,
in
1986,
long
after
the
statute
was
passed,
that
ferc
has
to
make
specific
findings
if
it
disagrees
with
the
state.
additionally,
congress
gave
to
the
department
of
interior,
under
section
18,
certain
powers
to
dictate
to
ferc,
for
example,
fish
passages.
ferc
has
no
choice
on
those.
so,
congress...
this
reference
to
cooperative
federalism
clearly
was
in
congress's
mind,
but
it
wasn't
a
cooperative
federalism
in
which,
on
all
issues
in
all
proceedings,
all
the
state
needed
to
do
is
tell
ferc
what
to
do.
but
they--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--it
doesn't...
congress
did
not
order,
in
1986,
ferc
to
always
comply
in
all
situations--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--well,
epa
has
some
authority
with
respect
to
any
state
water
quality
standards
that
are
less
stringent
than
epo's...
epa's
own
requirements.
it's
not
clear
that
epa,
under
the
act,
has
the
ability
to
go
beyond
that.
moreover,
it's...
if--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--if
this
decision
is--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
if
this
decision
is
affirmed,
then
you
will
have
precisely
held--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
i
don't
know,
justice
breyer,
about
the
wording
posed
in
your
hypothetical,
so
i
can't
answer
the
wording.
i
can
say
this,
that
effectively
the
states
can
do
precisely
that
by
simply
saying,
"we
want
the
river
water
quality
to
be
like
x,
and
x
is
inconsistent
with
there
being
any
dam
at
all
on
the
river.
"
so,
indeed,
if
this
decision
is
affirmed,
it
truly
does
mean
that
states
can
entirely
dictate
everything
having
to
do
with
any
environmental
aspects
of
dams,
including
to
the
point
of
requiring
that
the
dams
not
operate;
and
ferc
can
do
nothing
about
it.
we
do...
we
do
not
see
how
that
would
leave
any
sense
of
cooperative
federalism,
and
it
would
tell
congress,
"in
1986,
you
were
just
entirely
wasting
your
time,
because
you
had
already,
in
'72,
given
them
the
power
to
control
everything.
"
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
ferc
has
sort
of
been
all
over
the
place.
they're
sort
of
the
odd
man
out,
because
it's
their
jurisdiction
that's
being
taken
away;
and
yet
we're
talking
about
a
clean
water
act
case
where
epa
is
the
agency
defined
with
that
act.
ferc
has
argued
to
the
courts,
on
several
occasions,
that
401
needs
to
be
limited
to
discharge
of
pollutants.
ferc,
at
one
point,
the
first
several
dam
proceedings
that
came
up,
it
didn't
even
require
certifications
at
all.
it
then
promulgated
certification
requirements
that
said,
"either
get
a
certification
or
otherwise
comply
with
the
law.
"
and
then,
in
the
interim
period,
it
is
simply...
as
we've
been
affected,
simply
said,
"go
get
your
certifications".
it
then
tried
to
say,
"but
we
can
do
something
about
it
if
we
don't
like
them.
"
and
the
circuit
courts,
at
least
one,
has
said,
"no,
you
can't".
and
when
401
applies,
as
this
court
found
in
public
utility
districts
versus
jefferson,
it
is
a
robust
power.
it
is
an
awesome
power
that
is
given
to
the
states
under
401.
and
to...
giving
that
power
greatly
cabined
in
ferc's
authority
to
now
extend
that
power
automatically
to
any
conduct
that
in
any
way
"touches
on
the
water"
by
turning
"touches
on
the
water"
or
"moving
the
water"
into
"discharge
into
the
water"...
effectively
wipes
out
that
balance
entirely.
i
would
note,
too,
that
we
don't
even...
we
can
answer
all
of
this
without
even
getting
into
those
by
going
back
to
the
statute.
we
have
a
statute
here
that
uses
the
word
421
occasions
in
37
different
sections
of
the
statute.
with
the
exception
of
the
section
that
deals
with
the
discharge
of
employees...
not
into
the
river...
and
the
discharge--
[laughter]
--and
the
discharge
of
board
duties,
in
every
single
one
of
those
instances,
as
you
thumb
through
the
statute,
congress
is
always
clearly
talking
about
"putting
something
into
the
water".
there
is
no
doubt.
on
the
one
occasion
in
the
statute--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--well,
the
water
slows
down,
meanders
around,
as
it
would
in
an
eddy,
and
continues
on
through
the
dam,
down
the
river.
if
you
take
a
water
molecule,
it
comes
down,
goes
through
and
out.
if...
unless
you
get--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
the...
i
would
say,
in
an
ordinary
dictionary
definition,
if
you
stand
below
the
hoover
dam
and
look
up
at
it,
you
would
say,
"water
is
emitting
from
the
dam.
"
"water
is
discharging
from
the
dam.
"
in
an
ordinary
dictionary
definition.
i
would
agree
with
that.
what
i'm
saying,
though,
is
that
if
you
keep
in
mind
that
it's
not
a
reservoir
emitting
into
a
river,
but
it's
a
single
river
flowing
through
the
dam,
that
water
is
not
"discharging
into"
that
water.
that's
what
we're
saying.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
if
you
have
two
water
bodies,
then
you
could
have
one
discharging
into
the
other.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
in
miccosukee,
the
court
actually
go
into
that
and
set
forth...
in
fact,
remanded
the
case
to
decide
whether
the
aquifer
was
one
water
body
or
two.
if
you
look
at
that
remand,
it's
absolutely
clear
that
this
water
body,
under
any
standard
discussed
in
that
opinion,
would
be
a
single
water
body.
and
the
united
states
agrees
with
us
on
that.
the
united
states
agrees
we're
talking
about
a
single
water
body
here.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
and
i
could--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
if
one
thinks
of
upstream
waters
and
downstream
waters,
it...
our
view
is
that
upstream
waters
simply
become
downstream
waters
as
they
flow
through
the
dam.
one
doesn't
discharge
into
another.
i
would...
i
would
concede
that
very
bright
people
working
very
hard
with
virtually
any
words
in
the
english
language
can
find
some
way
to
reach
a
point
to
say
that
perhaps
something
fits
something.
but,
at
some
point...
at
some
point,
i
think
we
need
to
ask,
is...
if
congress
uses
the
same
word
throughout
the
statute
to
always
mean
putting
something
into
water,
then
how
do
we
get
to
the
conclusion
that
what
that
really
means
is
doing
anything
to
the
water
is
always...
because--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--the--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--well
it
makes...
it
is
linguistically
logical
to
say
that
we're,
therefore,
going
to
assume
that
a
pollutant
is
not
needed
here.
but
when
congress
has
replaced
the
"discharge
of
a
pollutant"
with
a
"discharge
into",
it
seems
to
me
congress
has
actually
moved
in
the
other
direction
of
reinforcing
that
we're
talking
about--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--putting
something
into
the
water.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
i
would...
i
would
hesitate,
justice
souter,
to
go
from
taking
a
specific
word,
like
"discharge",
and,
therefore,
saying
that
it
meant
something
that
is
both
more
general
and
much
more
easily
set.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
i
agree
with
you.
and
my
point
is,
i
am
including
instances
not
just
in
which
"pollutant"
is
used.
a
whole
variety.
and,
in
every
single
one
of
those,
its
common...
and
i
would
submit
that
the
word
itself,
when
you
use
the
word
"into",
naturally
suggests...
in
fact,
why
would
someone
use
the
phrase
"discharge
into
the
navigable
waters"
if
what
they
really
meant
was,
"if
you
do
anything
to
the
navigable
waters
at
all,
you've
got
to
get
a
permit?
"
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
i...
this
logic,
i
think,
would
probably
include
virtually
anything
you
do
to
the
water,
because
it
would
separate
the
water,
the
water
going
around
the
stick.
one
would
then
say
the
dictionary
definition
means
it's
then
discharging
back
into
itself
on
the
other
side
of
the
stick.
there
would
be,
perhaps,
no
water
quality
concerns,
but
401
doesn't
say
"water
quality
concerns";
it
says
"discharge
into".
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
under
the
government's
interpretation,
there
would
be.
there
would
be
a
discharge
into
the
navigable
waters
in
that
situation.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
because
the
post...
to
put...
well,
in
the
first
place,
putting
the
post
in
might,
itself,
be
a...
what
we
could
concede
to
be
a
discharge.
in
the
second
case,
though,
is
that
we
understand
that
you
would
be
exercising
control
over
the
flow
and
direction
of
that
water,
it
would
separate
the
river
into
two
portions...
of
course,
small.
but
if
we're
pursuing
this
line
of
logic
that
the
government
has
to
its
final
extent,
it
would
then
discharge
back
into
itself
on
the
other
side
of
that
post.
