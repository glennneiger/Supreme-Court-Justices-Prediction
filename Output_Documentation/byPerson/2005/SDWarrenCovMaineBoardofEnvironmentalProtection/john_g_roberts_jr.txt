we'll
hear
argument
next
in
s.
d.
warren
company
versus
maine
board
of
environmental
protection.
mr.
kayatta.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kayatta,
if
i
took
a
drum
of
water
out
of
the
river
and
put
it
in
the
garage
next
to
the
river
for
5
years,
and,
5
years
later,
came
out
and
poured
that
drum
of
water
back
into
the
river,
is
that
a
discharge
into
the
river?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
it
different
here,
where
you
have
the
dam
restraining
the
waters
for
a
certain
period,
and
then
it's
being
released
later,
at
a
subsequent
time?
why--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--isn't
that
also
a
discharge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
it's
retained
in
a...
what...
an
impoundment
pool,
or
whatever,
behind--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so,
you
think
it's
a
different
case
if
it's
not
a
continuous
motion;
in
other
words,
that
the
water
is
released...
you
know,
it's
released
on
the
weekends,
but,
during
the
week,
it
has
to
build
up
in
the...
you
would
draw
a
distinction
and
say
there's
a
discharge,
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
don't
dispute
that
ferc
could
impose
the
same
conditions
that
maine
has
imposed
in
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
ferc
authority.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
they
even
impose
something
in
the
condition
to
your
hydroelectric
power
license
saying,
"you
must
comply
with
state
water
quality
standards?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
you're
concerned
about
conditions...
i
mean,
as
a
practical
matter,
in
terms
of
how
the
result
in
this
case
would
change
things,
it's
a
question
of
whether
ferc
has
to
more
or
less
accept
what
the
state
does,
or
whether
ferc
simply
considers
and
decides
whether
it
wants
to
impose
those
conditions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
rather
be
regulated
more
aggressively
by
ferc
than
by
the
maine
board
of
environmental
protection.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
ferc--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--as
a
regulator,
tend
to
give
greater
priority
to
power
considerations,
as
opposed
to
local
environmental
concerns?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
don't
understand,
linguistically,
why
this
isn't
"putting
something
into
the
water",
to
the
extent
the
dam
holds
back
and
restrains
the
water,
then
it
"puts
back
into
the
water"
the
water
that
it
had
held
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
here's...
i'm
thinking
of
the
hoover
dam,
and
it's
got
these
huge,
you
know,
discharge
points.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
every
now
and
then
they
let
the
water
come
out.
isn't
that
a
discharge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
rowe?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
there
a
discharge
if
you
have
a
simple
waterwheel
in
the
river?
is
that
a
discharge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
so
it's
a
old
hydroelectric
plant,
it
uses
a
simple
waterwheel.
i
mean,
is
that...
does
that
fit
your
definition
of
a
"discharge"?
in
other
words,
it
restrains
the
water
temporarily.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
then
it
releases
it
again
as
it
passes
by
the
wheel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
if
you
put
a
waterwheel
in
a
flowing
river,
under
your
definition,
that's
a
discharge
into
the
navigable
water.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
doesn't...
but
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
that
doesn't
matter
to
your
analysis.
it's
the
one
post,
right?
i
mean,
if
you
have
just
sort
of
a
foot
indentation
on
either
side,
would...
the
flows,
in...
under
your
view,
suddenly
becomes
a
discharge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we're
trying
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--define--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--a
statutory
term
that's
going
to
apply
in
a
wide
variety
of
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then...
but
your
focus...
in
response
to
my
question
about
what
would
constitute
release,
you
focused
on
the
fact
of
impoundment,
a
restriction
of
the
flow.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
ladle
analogy
that
the
court
has
made
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
is...
refutes
that,
because
if
it's
hold...
you're
holding
it
up
in
the
ladle,
that's
like
an
impoundment.
you've
separated
it,
to
that
extent,
from
the
other
body,
and
the
court
said,
when
you
pour
it
back
in,
that's
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
not
a
discharge
of
a
pollutant--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
there
was
no
dispute
that
there
were
pollutants,
so
it
must
mean
it
wasn't
a
discharge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
don't...
you
don't
value
it
as
much
as
ferc
does,
though,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
isn't
one
way
to
look
at
this...
i
mean,
the
concern
is
that
your
constituents
probably
have
a
higher
priority
and
a
greater
concern
with
the
environmental
consequences
of
generating
power,
while
ferc's
priority
is
to
make
sure
that
we
have
sufficient
power.
and
you're
likely
to
weigh
these
competing
uses
in
very
different
ways.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
general
rowe.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--surprised,
in
a
case
involving
a
ferc
license
condition,
that
no
one
from
ferc
signed
on
to
your
brief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
it's
a
case
involving
a
ferc
license,
and
ferc
isn't
there,
i
think
it
says
a
great
deal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
know
what
ferc's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--do
you
know
what
ferc's
position
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure
of
that,
and
it
involves
a
reconciliation
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--competing
positions.
is
there
anything
that
ferc
has
issued
that
is
illuminating
with
respect
to
their
view?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
a
state
could
adopt
water
quality
standards
that
would,
in
effect,
preclude
hydroelectric
power
in
the
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
they
do--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
statewide?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
saying,
"it
is
of
utmost
importance
to
us
to
provide
habitat
for
spawning
salmon,
whatever,
dams
interfere
with
that
in
a
way
we
find
objectionable,
so
we're
going
to
go
a
different
direction,
as
a
matter
of
power
policy
for
the
state
of
whatever,
and
not
allow
hydroelectric
power.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
in
04-1527,
s.
d.
warren
company
versus
maine
board
of
environmental
protection.
