but
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
saying
the
changes
occur
in
the
river,
above
the
dam;
and,
therefore,
what's
let...
what's
let
back
into
the
river
below
the
dam
is
the
same
river,
unchanged.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
not
the
release.
you
contest
that
the
release
makes
any
change.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say,
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
doesn't
seem
to
me
normal
usage.
i
don't
think
it...
you
know,
if
you
see
a
rapids
in
a
river,
it
would
be
strange
to
say
the
rapids
of
the
colorado
"discharge"
into
the
colorado.
you're
usually
talking
about
a
different
body
of
water.
you
could
say
the
green
river
discharges
into
the
colorado.
likewise,
a
waterfall,
you
wouldn't
say,
you
know,
"the
waterfall
on
this
river
discharges
into
the
river.
"
it's
part
of
the
river.
but
if
it
were
a
waterfall
that
brought
a
tributary
into
the
river,
you
would
then
say
that,
you
know,
"the
waterfall
discharges
into
the
colorado.
"
or
whatever
river
it
enters
at
that
point.
it
seems
to
me
very
strange
to
talk
about
a
river
discharging
into
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
issue
is
not
whether
there
is
a
discharge,
as
i
see
it.
the
issue
is
whether
there's
a
"discharge
into
the
river".
and
one
does
not
usually
speak
of
the
"river
discharging
into
itself".
that...
it's
the
"into"
that's
the
crucial
part.
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
from
miccosukee,
if
i'm
saying
it
right
+/?
yes,
miccosukee--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
we
had,
you
know,
a
pumping
of
water
from
one
polluted
body
into
another,
and
it
was
held...
we
held
that
that
was
not
a
discharge?
justice
antonin
scalia
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
crucial--
justice
antonin
scalia
--word
was
"discharge".
the
reason
we
held
"it
was
not
covered"
is
not
because
there
was
no
pollutant.
it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
pollutant.
but
we
held
there
was
no
discharge.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
there
was
no
"discharge
of
a
pollutant".
there
were
pollutants
in...
on
both
sides.
that...
i
think
that
was
conceded
in
the
case.
the
reason
the
case
came
out
the
way
it
did
was
that
we
held
there
was
no
"discharge
of
a
pollutant".
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
it
conceded
that
there
was
a
pollutant...
that
a
pollutant
was
involved
in
that
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
what
must
have
been
the
difference
was
that
there
was
no
discharge.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
discharge
of
anything.
it
was
clear
that
if
there
was
a...
if
there
was
a
discharge,
it
was
a
discharge
of
a
pollutant.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
only
if
you
assume
that
letting
out
the
same
water
into
the
same
river
is
pollution.
it
seems
to
me
you're
begging
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
there
were
a
discharge
of
something
into
the
river,
you'd
be
able
to
move
against
it.
but
the
question
here
is
whether
there's
any
discharge
into
the
river
when
you
stop
the
river
and
then
let
the
same
river
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
maximums
or
minimums?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
expect
that
they're
minimums.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
any
significant
obstruction
in
the
river
amounts
to
a...
creates
a
discharge.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
if
it's
a
small
enough
stream,
i
suppose
just
swimming
in
it
or
lying
sideways
so
you
impede
the
flow,
you
are
causing
a
discharge
into
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
i
find
that
peculiar.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
depends
on
how
big
the
river
is,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
section
402
uses
"discharge"
in
the
same
sense,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is...
it
is
broader.
but
if...
the
discharge
of
a
pollutant
into
the
same
body
of
water
does
not
constitute
the
addition
of
a
pollution...
of
a
pollutant.
it
obviously
is
the
addition
of
a
pollutant.
the
only
reason
you
could
say
that
taking
it
from
one...
pumping
it
from
one
polluted
body
to
another
is
not
a
discharge
of
a
pollutant,
which
is
what
we
said
in
miccosukee,
the
only
basis
for
saying
that
is
that
there
has
been
no
discharge.
there's
obviously
been
an
addition
of
a
pollutant
to
the...
to
the
other
body
of
water.
the
only
thing
you
can
say
is,
there
hasn't
been
a
discharge.
it's...
because
it's
the
same
body
of
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
if,
in
miccosukee,
liquid
of
the
same
composition
had
been
taken
from
another
body
of
water,
and
from...
not
the
body
of
water
that
was
adjacent
and
which
we
held
was
the
same
body
of
water...
with
the
same
composition,
and
that
had
been
added,
do
you
think
miccosukee
would
have
come
out
the
same
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
that
you
could
take
pollutants
from
a
different
body
of
water
and
add
it
to
an
already
polluted
stream?
i
thought
that
was
clear
that
that's
not
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
if
it
was
one
body
of
water,
it
was
okay,
and
if
it
was
two
bodies
of
water,
it
was
bad,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
add
pollutants
to
the
other
body
whether
it
comes
from
the
adjacent
body
or
whether
it
comes
from
some
distant
body.
the
only
reason
that
the
pumping
from
the
adjacent
body
did
not
qualify
is...
not
because
there
no
addition
of
pollutants.
there
would
be
an
addition
of
pollutions
from
a
distant
lake,
and
you...
we'd
be
able
to
hold
a
person
liable.
the
only
reason
there
was
no
addition
here
was
that
there
was...
there
was
an
addition
here,
but
there
was
no
discharge,
because
it
was
the
same
body
of
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
you
have
here.
