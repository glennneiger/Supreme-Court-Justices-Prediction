paul
stevens
now,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
one
point
fully.
but
the
character
of
the
water
is
different
above
the
dam
and
below
the
dam.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
agreed
that
there
was
a
different...
a
different
oxygen
content
in
the
water.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it's
the
same
water,
with
a
slightly
different
chemical
composition,
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
with
a
slightly
different
chemical
composition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
i
say
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
counsel,
i
keep
thinking
of
this
example,
and
i
want
you
to
comment
on
it.
out
west,
of
course,
there
are
a
lot
of
dams
where
there
are
salmon
in
the...
in
the
river,
going
down,
and
a
lot
of
salmon
get
killed
if
they
go
through
the...
through
the
dam,
so
that
the
water
before
the
dam
has
live
salmon,
and
the
water
after
the
dam
has
dead
salmon.
and
say
that
happened
in
maine.
would
that
be
a
discharge
if
that
happened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
were
live
fish--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--above
the
dam,
and
they
all...
they
get
killed
going
through
the
dam,
and
they
were
dead
when
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--came
out,
would
that
be
a
discharge
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
would
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--even
in
that
case,
that
would
not
be
a
statutory
discharge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
rowe,
may
i
ask
this
question?
in
the
miccosukee
case,
we
sent
the
case
back,
as
you
remember,
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
were
one
body
of
water
or
two
bodies
of
water.
in
your
view,
are
there
one
or
two
bodies
of
water...
it
would
be
five
bodies
of
water...
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--concede
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
