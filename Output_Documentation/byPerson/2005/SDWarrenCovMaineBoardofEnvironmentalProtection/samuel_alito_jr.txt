justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
has
ferc
said
that
this
is
a
problem,
that
the
states
are
interfering?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that,
let's
say,
the
missouri
river
discharges
into
the
mississippi?
is
that
consistent
with
ordinary
usage?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
they're
two
water
bodies,
only
because
people
gave
them
two
different
names.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
statute
doesn't
say
"discharge
from
one
water
body
into
another
water
body.
"
it
says
"discharge
into
the
navigable
waters".
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
the
portion
of
the
river
below
the
dam
is
a
navigable
water,
why
is
there
not
a
pouring
forth
of
the
water
into
the
navigable
waters
below
the
dam?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you,
as
justice
breyer's
question
to
your
adversary
suggested,
adopt
water
quality
standards
that
would
make
any
hydroelectric
power
impossible,
in
name?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that's
something
that
congress
intended
when
they
adopted
this,
to
allow
a
state
to
rule
out
hydroelectric
power?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
have
a
facility
that
produces
adverse
environmental
effects
in
one
state,
but
produces
power
for
a
number
of
adjoining
states.
why
does
it
make
sense
for
the
state
in
which
the
facility
is
located
to
do
the
balancing
of
the
environmental
and
the
power
considerations
in
that
situation?
