well,
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
this
is
an
important
point
for
me,
and
i
wasn't
quite
clear
what
the
briefs
told
me
about
it.
my
understanding
was
that
there
is
an
argument
that
when
the
water
stays
in
the
reservoir,
the
impoundment
area,
that
there's
a
stratification,
and
the
oxygen
components
at
different
levels
change,
so
that
when
the
water
goes
back
into
the
dam,
it's
qualitatively
different.
it's
the
same
water,
in
a
sense,
but
it's
also
qualitatively
different
in
its
oxygen
and
other
characteristics.
and
that
sounded
to
me
like
a
discharge.
justice

so,
if--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so,
if
it
were
established
in
this
case
that
the
water
is
qualitatively
changed
in
a
significant
degree
because
of
its
oxygen
component,
that
would
be
irrelevant
to
the
question
you're
asking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
what's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so,
what's
the
definition...
what's
the
general
definition
that
you're
giving
us
that
describes
this
result
you've
given?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
is
a
discharge,
because
a
"discharge"
means
what?
