justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
true,
but...
so,
you
said
it's
conceded
in
this
case?
i
thought,
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
you
said
something
that...
i
was
surprised,
if
it's
conceded.
i
thought
it
wasn't
conceded...
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
the
states
have
water
quality
standards.
those
water
quality
standards
may
or
may
not
have
something
to
do
with
point
source
discharges.
they
don't
have
to.
they
want
water
to
be
good
enough
for
recreation.
they
want
water
without
algae
so
there
are
more
fish.
they
have
a
lot
of
things.
and
this
statute
seems
to
say
the
f...
what
used
to
be
the
fpc.
i...
is
it
now
ferc?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay...
used
to
be
the
federal
power
commission...
tells
them,
"you
have
to
get
approval
to
build
your
dam.
"
"and
we're
not
going
to
give
you
approval
unless
you
comply
with
state
water
quality
standards.
"
this
seems
to
me
to
go
back
into
ancient
history,
like
1920.
and
of
course
you
have
to
comply.
and
so,
isn't
the
purpose
of...
is
there
agreement
that
it
only
concerns
point
discharges,
or
does
it
concern
water
quality
standards?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words...
discharge
from
a
point
source,
what
is...
well,
then
epa
concedes
you
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
problem?
so,
they're
saying,
as
i
thought
was
true
since
1920,
that
you're
going
to
get
your
dam
only
if
you
comply
with
state
standards,
including
standards
about
fish,
algae,
junk
in
the
water,
all
kinds
of
things
that
might
be
put
there
by
the
dam.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
and
they're
saying,
"of
course
there
is
a
discharge.
"
"the
discharge
is
a
discharge
of
water.
"
okay?
the
water
runs
into
it.
now,
that's
enough
for
you
to
have
to
comply
with
the
state
standards
before
the
f...
ferc
is
going
to
give
you
a
license.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
have
you
got
anything...
i've
heard
you
argue
about
the
word
"discharge";
and
you
say
"discharge"
doesn't
mean
"discharge
of
water",
it
means
something
else.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
logical
argument.
is
there
any
other
argument
that
you'd
have,
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
for
the
objective?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
say...
it
says
they
have
to
comply
with
state
water
quality
standards,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
thought...
it
says
that
you
have
to
get
your
permit.
you
have
to
be
compliant
with
state
water
quality
standards.
now,
suppose
a
state
has
a
nutty
water
quality
standard.
doesn't
epa
have
some
authority
there
to
make
sure
that
a
water
quality
standard
of
a
state,
under
the
clean
water
act,
is...
makes
sense?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
if
a
state
were
to
say,
"our
water
quality
standard
is
the
following.
"
"we
never
build
a
dam
in
our
state,
no
matter
what.
"
okay?
now,
there's
no
authority
in
the
epa
to
set
that
aside
as
it
not
being
a
proper
clean
water
act
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
to
be
just
a
clean
water
act
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
an
expert
on
the
clean
water
act.
is
that
a
proper
clean
water
act
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
this
decision...
i'm
not
asking
you
about
this
decision.
i'm
asking
you
if
a
state,
under
the
clean
water
act,
were
to
say,
"we
have
the
following
clean"...
now
you
understand
what
i'm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
epa,
or
anyone
else,
have
authority
to
say,
"that
isn't
a
proper
clean
water
act
standard,
however
good
you
may
think
it
is?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
think
the
question...
maybe
it
just...
i
don't
understand,
totally,
how
the
clean
water
act
works,
but
i
thought
that
what
we're
talking
in
this
statute
is
a
state
rule
that's
called
the
state
clean
water
act
rule.
it's
a
creature
of
the
clean
water
act,
isn't
it?
a
water
quality
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and,
therefore,
a
state,
i
would
think,
that
had
some
totally
bizarre
clean
water
act
standard
might
find
that
it
had
a
standard
that
didn't
fit
within
the
scope
of
the
clean
water
act.
and,
therefore,
it
wasn't
going
to
be
enforced
here.
is
that
right,
or
not
right?
maybe
the
federal
government
will
explain
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
for
the
few
of
us
who
think
the
dictionary
doesn't
answer
the
case,
is
it
possible
you
could
say
a
word
about
why
congress
would,
or
would
not,
have
wanted,
in
effect,
to
incorporate
all
state
water
quality
standards
into
a
permission
to
build
a
dam?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
also
to
protect
fish?
