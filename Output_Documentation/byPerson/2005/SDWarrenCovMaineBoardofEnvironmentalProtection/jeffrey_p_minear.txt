mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
united
states
submits
that
the
operation
of
petitioner's
hydropower
facilities
results
in
a
discharge
into
the
navigable
waters
within
the
meaning
of
section
401
of
the
clean
water
act.
section
401
uses
the
term
"discharge"
in
its
ordinary
sense
to
mean
a
"flowing
out"
or
"issuing
out".
the
facilities
at
issue
in
this
case,
which
divert
water,
impound
it,
and
then
release
it,
produce
a
flowing
or
issuing
out
of
that
water
into
the
navigable
presumpscot
river.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
because
it
uses
the
term
"discharge
of
a
pollutant",
which
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--which
is
defined,
under
the
clean
water
act,
as
a
statutory
term
of
art,
to
mean
the
addition
of
a
pollution...
of
a
pollutant
from
a
point
source.
on
the
other
hand,
the
clean
water
act
interprets
or
defines
"discharge"
to
include
the
"discharge
of
a
pollutant".
so,
it's
clear
that
the
term
"discharge"
is
broader
than
the
term
"discharge
of
a
pollutant",
and
does
not
include
the
requirement
of
an
addition.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
because,
in
miccosukee,
it
addressed
the
specific
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
an
addition.
and,
in
the
much
quoted
soup
ladle
example,
what
it
was
talking
about,
in
that
instance,
was
taking
a
ladle
of
soup,
removing
it
from
the
pot,
and
adding
it
back.
the
pouring
back
of
the
soup
into
the
pot
is
a
discharge,
it's
a
flowing
or
issuing
out.
it's
not
an
addition,
because
nothing
is
being
added
to
the
soup.
now,
in
this
case,
we're
using
the
term
"discharge",
not
"addition".
and
there
is,
obviously,
a
flowing
or
issuing
out
from
the
dam.
anyone
who
goes
and
observes
a
dam,
and
sees
the
water
leaving
the
dam,
will
say
that's
a
"discharge".
that's
common
parlance.
it's
been
repeated
numerous
times
in
this
court's
own
decisions
in
describing
dam
operations.
furthermore--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
there
was
no
transmission.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
i
think,
justice
souter,
you
are
right
in
focusing
on
the
exiting
from
the
dam
and
why
discharges
are
important
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
i
think
it
would
have
come
out
the
same
way.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
if
we
look
to
the
miccosukee
opinion,
at
541
u.s.
109
to
110,
it
discusses
this
issue.
one
of
the
issues
there
is,
are
there
two
bodies
of
water
or
one
body
of
water?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
the
court...
that
question
was
left
unresolved
in
miccosukee.
that's
what's
being
tried
in
florida
right
now.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
but
in...
at
page
109,
what
this
court
said...
it
talked
about
the
s-9
pump,
which
was
central
there,
because
it
was
moving
the
body...
that
the...
the
water.
it
was
transmitting
it.
and
it
was...
talked
about
pumping
the
water
from
one
part
of
the
water
body
to
the
other.
that's
a
discharge,
even
though
it's
the
same
water
body.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
with--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--with
respect--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
you
have--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
exactly
backwards
with
what
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
in
miccosukee,
and
it
explains
why
our...
we
took
that
position.
and
the
court
upheld
our
position
in
miccosukee.
and
we're
taking
the
different
position
here.
because
here
we're
talking
about
a
discharge,
not
an
addition.
the
dictionary
definition
of
"discharge"
nowhere
speaks
of
"addition".
petitioners
have
not
pointed
to
any
dictionary
definition
that
speaks
in
terms
of
an
addition.
it
talks
about
a
flowing
or
issuing
out.
what
it
connotes
is
that
the
water
has,
in
some
sense,
been
contained
or
confined,
to
some
degree.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
its
issue
was--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
your
honor,
as
people
in
the
office
are
familiar
with,
in
the
sg's
office,
the
names
in
the
brief
tell
very
little
about
who
has
participated
in
the
discussions
and
the
writing
of
the
brief.
the
rapanos
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
your
honor,
this
is
primarily
a
case
about
the
clean
water
act.
i
would
point
to
the
rapanos
case,
immediately
before.
the
corps'
name
is
not
on
the
brief,
and
epa's
name
is
not
on
the
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
so,
we
can't
draw--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
certainly--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--do.
they
join
in
the
consensus
position
of
the
united
states.
this
brief
has
been
coordinated
not
only
with
epa
and
ferc,
but
also
the
department
of
the
interior
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers.
this
is
the
position
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
what's
illuminating
is
their
consistent
position,
since
1970,
when
this
provision
was
first
enacted
into
law,
in
the
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970,
2
years
before
the
clean
water
act
amendments.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it's
certainly
possible,
on
an
individual
river.
imagine
if
a
state
had
a
river
that
is
designated
as
a
wilderness
area
or
a
wild
and
scenic
river,
and
determined
it
did
not--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--want
to
have
hydropower.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if
they
did
it
statewide,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--if
they
did
it
statewide,
it
would
raise
a
question
of
whether
or
not
that
action
is
preempted
under
the
federal
power
act,
not
under
the
clean
water
act.
and
that
would...
that's
obviously
not
the
issue
here.
maine,
as
you
have
heard,
supports
hydropower
production.
the
question
here
is
reconciling
the
competing
roles
of
the
hydropower
company,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
state
and
federal
governments,
which,
in
the
spirit
of
cooperative
federalism,
work
together
on
these
matters.
we
are
very
supportive
of
the
states'
approach
of
reviewing
discharges
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
the
creation
of
pollution,
and
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
a
violation
of
their
water
quality
standards.
this
is
a
part
of...
an
important
role
that
the
state
has
under
the
clean
water
act,
that
congress
gave
to
the
state,
and
to
which
we
defend.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
one
of
the
things
that's
been
talked
about
here
is
the
oddity,
supposed
oddity,
of
a
water
discharging
into
itself.
and
that's
not
odd
at
all.
one
often
talks
about,
for
instance,
the
fresh
water
above
the
dam
being
discharged
into
the
fresh
waters
below.
that's...
there's
nothing
unusual
about
this,
because
we're
talking
about
the
characteristic
of
the
water
that
might
be
shared
by
the
water
that's
upstream
and
contained
in
the
dam
and
is
also
a
characteristic
of
the
water
below.
now,
under
section
401,
the
upstream
characteristic
doesn't
matter,
because
it's...
it
refers
to
"any
discharge",
and
it
says
"into
the
navigable
waters".
"into"
is
significant,
because
"any
discharge"
is
"out
of
something".
and
so,
it
can
also
be
"into
something".
and
by
stating
"into
navigable
waters,
congress
indicated
what
it
was
concerned
about,
which
was
that
discharges
that
go
into
the
navigable
waters
can
cause
pollution,
and,
therefore,
ought
to
be
reviewed
by
the
state
to
make
sure
the
water
quality
standards
are
being
met.
"
there's
nothing
unusual
in
this
at
all.
it
simply
indicates
that
congress
was
not
concerned
about
discharges
that
go
elsewhere;
for
instance,
into
a
municipal
water
system
or
onto
irrigated
land.
what
we
have
here--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
reason
why,
it
was
because
congress
gave
the
states
primary
authority
under
the
clean
water
act
to
deal
with
pollution.
discharges
from
confinements,
from
confined
water,
creates
pollution,
even
in
the
absence
of
pollutants,
by
the
stratification,
the
deprivation
of
oxygen,
and
the
like.
and
congress
recognized
that
where
there's
a
discharge,
there's
likely
to
be
a
pollution
problem,
and
that
pollution
problem
will
be
manifested
downstream.
and
it,
therefore,
makes
sense
for
the
state
to
be
able
to
review
and
determine
whether
or
not
its
water
quality
standards
will
be
met.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
it
includes
the
protection
of
fish.
and,
in
fact,
one
of
the
things
that
this
permit
does,
in
this
particular
case,
this
condition,
is,
it
ensures
that
there
is,
in
fact,
water
in
the
bypass
reaches.
in
the
absence
of
the
conditions
that
the
state
imposed
here,
there
would
be
no
water
at
all
in
the
bypass
reaches.
now,
it's
true
that
ferc
itself
can
impose
conditions
to
meet
these
requirements--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--may
i
answer
that
question--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor?
the
clean
water
act
provides
for
exactly
this
problem.
it
does
address
the
problem
of
interstate
pollution.
i
believe
that
this
court's
case
in
arkansas
versus
oklahoma
deals
with
that
type
of
issue.
it
provides
for
a
reconciliation,
with
epa
playing
an
important
role
in
those
interstate
concerns.
thank
you,
your
honor.
