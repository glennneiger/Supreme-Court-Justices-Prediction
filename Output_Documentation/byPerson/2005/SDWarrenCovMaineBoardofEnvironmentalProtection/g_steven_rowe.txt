mr.
g.
steven
rowe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
flow
of
water
through
petitioner's
dams
into
the
presumpscot
river
is
a
discharge,
under
section
401(a)
of
the
clean
water
act.
this
finding
is
supported
by
the
plain
text
of
section
401(a),
the
purpose,
the
history,
and
the
structure
of
the
clean
water
act,
in
more
than
30
years
of
administrative
practice
and
agency
interpretation.
under
the
clean
water
act,
congress--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--requires--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
for
401
to
apply
there
must
be
a
federally
licensed
activity.
in
that
case--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
yes,
your
honor.
it--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--it
could,
your
honor.
it
could
discharge.
it
depends
on
the
actual
circumstances.
obviously,
under
the
doctrine
of
de
minimis
non
curat
lex,
it
may
not
pose
any
problems,
and
it
wouldn't
be
an
issue.
but
certainly
to
the
extent
that
it
used
the
water
and
then
it
discharged
the
water,
there
was
emitting
out
or
flowing
out.
if
you
put
a
fishnet
in
the
river,
there
would
be
no
discharge.
justice
souter's
example
of
a
simple...
a
post,
probably
no
discharge.
but
if
you
put
a
hundred
foot...
a
post
100
foot
in
diameter
into
a
200-foot-wide
river,
then
you
may
have
a
discharge.
so,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
but,
remember,
401
does
require
it
to
be
a
federally
licensed
project.
the
point
i
was
going
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that,
under
the
clean
water
act,
congress
requires
states
to
adopt
clean
water
standards--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--water
quality
standards.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
justice
scalia,
it's
not
strange
at
all.
it's
not...
it's
discharging
from
the
activity
into
the
river.
the
water
goes
into
the
activity.
the
activity,
in
this
case,
is
a...
an
impoundment.
there
are
five
impoundments.
these
dams
create
impoundments.
one's
197
acres--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--in
size.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
your
honor,
my
point
is,
that's
not
the
case
we
have.
we're
talking
about
a
hydroelectric
dam
here.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
but--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--but--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
yes.
in
that
case,
your
honor,
i've
said
it
could
cause
a
discharge...
if
the
flow
was
interrupted,
the
flow
regimen
of
the
river,
to
such
an
extent
that
it...
that
it
increased,
substantially,
the
flow
on
one
side,
and
that
was
a
federally
licensed
activity,
then
401
would
apply.
it
would
be
a
discharge
from
the
activity.
now,
i'm...
again,
i'm
using
the
de
minimis
rule
here.
but
what
we
have
here,
your
honors,
is
the
dam,
we
have
the
water
being
diverted
into
a
power
canal,
then
dropping
down
onto
the
top
of
the
turbines.
the
turbines
are
using
the
water,
they're
taking
the
energy
from
the
water
to
turn
the
turbine,
and
then
the
water
is
being
released.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
it's
being
discharged.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
justice--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--kennedy--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--it
means
a
flowing
or
issuing
out.
it's
the...
it
is
the
dictionary
definition.
mr.
kayatta
mentioned
the
hoover
dam.
it
is
that.
that's
what
it
is.
it's
the--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--ordinary
definition.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
well,
your
honor,
miccosukee--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--your
honor,
the...
in
miccosukee,
that
was
a
section
402
case.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
it
dealt
with
discharge
of
a
pollutant.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
and
this--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--court
held--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--no,
your
honor,
you
held
that
there
was
"no
discharge
of
a
pollutant".
you
held
that
it
was--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--but
there...
your
honor...
your
honor,
in
that
case,
it
required
a
discharge
of
a
pollutant
from
a
point
source.
the
definition
of
401
is
much
broader.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
your...
yes,
your
honor,
but
the--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--there
was
"no
discharge
of
a
pollutant",
your
honor.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
your
honor,
in...
with
all
due
respect,
in
that
case...
and,
in
that
case,
you
joined
justice
thomas
in
saying,
"the
term
"discharge"
is
not
defined
in
the
clean
water
act,
but
its
plain
and
ordinary
meaning
suggests
a
flowing
or
issuing
out,
or
something
that
is
emitted.
"
in
the
case
we
have
here,
something
is
admitted.
it
is
water.
it
is
emitted
from
a
facility.
we
have
a
federally
licensed
facility.
and
out
of
the
turbines
comes
water,
and
it
flows
into
the
river.
miccosukee
was
a
402
case,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect.
and,
in
another
point,
i--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--that's--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
the
pollutant
was
already
in
the
water
when
it...
when
it
entered...
the
water
from
the
pipe.
and
the
point
that
justice
ginsburg's
mentioned,
the
quote,
is,
if
one
takes
a
ladle
of
soup
from
a
pot,
lifts
it
up
above
the
pot
and
pours
it
back
into
the
pot,
one
has
not
added
soup
or
anything
else
to
the
pot.
section
401,
the
word
"discharge"
in
that
section
does
not
require
an
addition
of
anything.
it
can
be--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--it
wasn't--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--no,
mr.
chief--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
didn't
say
that
there
was
no
discharge;
the
court
said
that
there
was
no
addition
of
soup
or
anything
else
into
the
pot.
the
point
is,
there
was
not
the
addition
of
a
pollutant.
and
you
do
not
need
the
addition
of
a
pollutant
to
find
a
discharge,
under
section
401.
i
just
want
to
remind
the
court
that
section
401
came
from
section
21(b)
of
the
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970.
that
was
the
old
section
401.
it
said,
"anytime
that
there's
a
licensed
activity
that's
going
to
create
a
discharge
from
a
facility
into
navigable
waters,
then
the
states
are
to
enforce
their
water
quality
standards.
"
congress
requires
states
to
adopt
water
quality
standards,
according
to
section
303.
and
we
have.
all
states
have.
and
those
water
quality
standards
are
consistent.
we
have
designated
uses,
water
quality
criteria,
and
an
antidegradation
policy.
the
court
should
know
that,
as
part
of
our
designated
uses,
hydropower
is
one
of
those.
the
state
values
hydropower.
we
understand
the
importance
of
it.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
most--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--your
honor,
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
you
heard...
your
honor,
you
heard
earlier--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--well,
your
honor,
you
heard
earlier
about
the...
1986,
the
electric
consumers
protection
act.
that
did
require
ferc
to
give
equal
consideration
to
the
protection
of
the
environment
with
respect
to
the
production
of...
hydropower
production.
but
the
states
have
a
responsibility
given
to
them
by
congress.
the
states
have
the
primary
responsibility
for
the
prevention,
for
the
reduction,
and
for
the
elimination
of
pollution.
the
way
we
enforce
that
is
through
our
water
quality
standards.
and
so,
the
only
way
we
can
enforce
those
standards
with
respect
to
federally
licensed
facilities
is
section
401.
and
if
you
should
take
that
from
us,
it
will
create
a
gaping
hole
in
the
clean
water
act.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
your
honor--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--the--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--your
honor,
the
"pollution",
as
defined
in
the
clean
water
act,
is
the
alteration
of
the
physical,
chemical,
and
biological
integrity
of
the
water.
that's
the
pollution.
the
reason
401
exists,
and
the
reason
"discharge"
is
used
broadly,
and
it's
the
trigger
for
the
section
to
work,
is
because
you
look
at
the
impacts
of
that
activity
on
the
environment.
you
look
at
the
physical
integrity...
has
it
been
altered
+/?
the
chemical
integrity,
the
biological
integrity.
we
look
at
things
like
the
impact
on
aquatic
ecosystems,
the
thermal
stratification
in
the
impoundment
areas,
whether
there
is
lower
dissolved
oxygen.
and
certainly
we
look
at
the
fish
migration
issues.
has
there
been
blockage?
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
your
honor,
we
could.
we
have
a
number
of
classes
of
rivers.
with
respect
to
one
class,
that
is
not
a
designated
use.
with
respect
to
all
the
others,
hydropower
is
the
designated
use.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
justice
alito,
congress
did
not
give
the
states
unbounded
authority.
indeed,
in
section
401(d),
there
is
a
restriction.
it
restricts
the
conditions
to
those
necessary
to
assure
that
the
applicant
will
comply
with
conditions
in
our
water
quality
standards.
and
if...
i
mean,
ferc
does
incorporate
those
standards
into
the
license,
but
the
applicant
can
redress
that
in
court,
as
this
one
has.
so,
we...
i
want
to
mention,
again,
that
states
care
about
hydropower.
we
care
about
fish
migration.
we
care
about
recreation
activities.
we
care
about
all
of
these
things,
and
they're
all
incorporated
into
our
water
quality
standards.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
well,
your--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--your
honor,
in
our
state
it's
a
designated
use--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--on
most
of
our
rivers.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
your...
justice
souter,
a
state...
a
state
could
do
that
if
it
changed
the
designated
uses
for
its
rivers.
but
in
the
state
of
maine,
as
in
45
states--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--well,
your
honor,
again,
i
want
to...
under
the
clean
water
act,
the
states
have
primary
responsibility
for
the
reduction
and
for
the
elimination
and--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--prevention
of
pollution.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
well,
your
honor,
i'm
sure
the
federal
government
will
also
address
this
question,
but
the
parameters
of
the
water
quality
standards
are
addressed
in
section
303
of
the
clean
water
act.
and
there
are
parameters
in
there.
and
the
states'
clean
water...
or
water
quality
standards
must
conform
to
those
standards.
we
submit
our
clean...
our
water
quality
standards--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--your
honor,
it's
simply
categories
in
there.
we
submit--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--we...
well,
they
are
minimums,
your
honor.
we
submit
these
to
the
epa.
the
epa
approves
the
state
water
quality
standards,
and
then
those
standards
are
how
we
evaluate
these
federally
licensed
activities
as
to
whether
they're
in
compliance
or
not.
and
they
determine
the
certification,
whether
it's
issued,
and
if
it's
issued,
with
what
conditions.
if
a
state...
if
a
state's
rivers
were
not
conducive
to
hydropower...
the
question
you
asked,
your
honor
was...
justice
souter...
could
a
state
prevent
hydropower
from
occurring?
again,
we
have,
with
respect
to
a
few
rivers
in
the
state
of
maine;
but
most
of
the
rivers,
it
is
a
designated
use,
because
states,
like
the
federal
government,
value
hydropower.
there
is
no
air
pollution.
it's
a
clean
source
of
energy.
we
value
it.
and,
indeed,
the
antidegradation
policies
that
are
part
of
our
water
quality
standards
require
us
to
look
at
the
impact
on
petitioner's
dams,
the
power
output
that's
going
to
be...
going
to...
is
going
to
result
from
these
various
conditions
that
we
impose
as
a
part
of
our
certification.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
there's
one
body
of
water,
your
honor...
justice
stevens.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
and
that's
the--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--that's
the--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--presumpscot
river.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
all
the
water
is
waters
of
the
united
states,
navigable
waters,
but
the
water
is
being
discharged
from
the
facility
into
the
navigable
waters.
you...
your
honor
has
mentioned
a
storage
dam.
a
storage
dam
creates
an
impoundment.
in
fact,
one
of
these
dams
has
a
50-foot-high
wall
that
holds
the
water
back,
almost
200
acres
of
water.
at
times,
there
is
water
that
goes
over
the
top
of
the
dam.
that
is,
indeed,
a
discharge.
it
is
caused
by
the
activity.
it
results
from
the
activity.
it's
not
the
free
flowing
water.
and
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
i
think,
justice
scalia,
your
question
was...
that's
not
a
discharge.
that's
the
natural
flow
of
water.
what's
happening
here
is,
the
flow
is
being
altered.
because
of
the
impoundment,
because
of
the
diversion,
the
flow
is
being
altered.
and
in
the
case
at
hand
here,
you're
actually
taking
a
turbine,
the
water
drops
down
into
the
turbine,
turns
the
turbine
blades
or
fans,
it
absorbs
the
water
of
its
power,
and
then
the
water
is
released,
discharged,
into
the
tailrace
channel,
into
the
natural
river.
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
no,
i'd...
no,
your--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--that...
justice
scalia,
that's
not
what
i
said.
the
question
was
asked
about
a
post,
like
a
bridge,
the
pilings
for
a
bridge.
in
certain
cases,
depending
on
the
size,
it
might
result
in
a
discharge.
i'm
not
saying
every...
a
stick
in
the
river
is,
certainly
not
a
swimmer.
we
have
a
de
minimis
rule.
we're
not
saying
that.
it
needs
to
be--
mr.
g.
steven
rowe
--well,
i'm...
if
it's
navigable
waters,
and
you
have
a
huge
post
that's
holding
up
a
bridge,
there
could
be
a...
there...
and
it's
federally
licensed...
there
could
be
a
discharge
resulting
from
that.
i
mean,
i...
that
is
what
a
person
would
say,
"there
is
a
discharge",
because
suddenly
you
see...
where
water
was
naturally
flowing,
you
see
a
diversion,
in
an
impoundment,
of
sorts,
moving
the
water
over.
but
what
we
have
here
is
not
that
case.
what
we
have
here
is
an
impoundment.
we
have
the
water
being
diverted
into
a
narrow
channel,
dropping
down
onto
these
turbines,
being
used,
and
then
being
discharged
into
the
river.
the
word
1970,
under
the
21(b),
was
given
a
broad
definition.
402
and
404
came
later,
in
1972,
as
part
of
the
clean
water
act.
in
those,
we're
dealing
with
discrete
conveyances
of
pollutants,
402.
and
404
was
dredge
or
fill
discharge.
and
those
were
deemed
necessary.
but
they're
consumed
in
401.
in
other
words,
if
you
get
a
402,
if
you
need
a
40...
a
402
application,
certification,
you
also
will
need
a
401.
401
deals
with
the
effects
of
pollution,
the
effects
of
the
activity
on
the
environment.
i
thank
your
honors
very
much.
and
i
just
want
to
remind
the
court
that
the
state
very
much
values
the
power...
the
importance
of
hydropower.
we
value
the...
our
responsibility,
as
given
to
us
by
congress
under
the
clean
water
act,
to
be
the
primary
enforcer
of
our
