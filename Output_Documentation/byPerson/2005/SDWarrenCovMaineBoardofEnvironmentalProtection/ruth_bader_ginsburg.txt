assumed
that...
the
soup
ladle
example
from
the
second
circuit;
you
took
out
the
ladle,
you
held
it
up,
and
you
put
the
same
thing
back.
but
if
i
understand
what
happens
as
a
result
of
the
impoundment
of
the
water
and
then
its
release,
what
comes
out
is
quite
different
from
what
was
put
in.
it's
kind
of
like
you
had
a
pot
boiling
with
vegetables,
and
then
you
put
it
through
a
food
processor,
and
then
what
you
got
out
would
be
quite
different
from
what
went
into
the
food
processor.

i
thought
the
descriptions
that
we
had
was,
it
is
a
result
of
the
impoundment
and
the
subsequent
release
that
the
water
emerges
in
this
unnatural
state,
in
this
striated
state
that
justice
kennedy
was
referring
to.
