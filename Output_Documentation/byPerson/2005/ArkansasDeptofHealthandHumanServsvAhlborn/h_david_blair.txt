mr.
h.
david
blair
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
problem
here,
of
course,
is
one
where
the
funds,
the
proceeds,
to
resolve
a
claim
are
less
than
the
damages
of
all
parties,
including
the
medical
bills
that
have
been
paid
by
the
state.
now,
the
court
is
correct
that
not
only
under
the
federal
statute
did
the
state
have
the
option
of
pursuing
an
independent
cause
of
action,
there
is
a
state
statute
that
provides
that
very
thing,
our
code
20-77-301.
and
in
fact,
that
statute,
in
effect,
allows
a
splitting
of
the
common
law
cause
of
action
for
personal
injury,
which
otherwise
would
be
prohibited.
but--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--she
would
not
have
a
disincentive
to
cooperate.
she
might
not
have
an
incentive
to
cooperate
because
they're
bringing
their
own
lawsuit.
mr.
h.
david
blair
correct.
mr.
h.
david
blair
that...
that
is
correct.
had
the--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--correct.
mr.
h.
david
blair
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
that
the
duty
to
cooperate
necessarily
included
the
duty
to
include
the
state
in
the
loop
in
the
settlement
process.
mr.
h.
david
blair
that
is--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--the
dismissal,
of
course,
followed
the
settlement.
what
the
complaint
is,
is
that
they
were
not
consulted
about
the
settlement
process.
and
it
would
have
been
of
no
benefit
had
they
been
consulted
about
the
settlement
process.
the
defendants
were
only
going
to
pay
a
certain
amount
of
money.
had
the
state
shown
up
at
the
settlement
hearing
if...
or
the
conference,
if
there
was
such
a
thing,
no
doubt
it
would
have
taken
the
position
that
it
takes
here,
that
it's
entitled
to
be
paid
in
full.
mr.
h.
david
blair
that's
correct,
your
honor.
had--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--well,
first
of
all,
the...
the
remedy
that
the
petitioner
here
proposes
is
one
that
congress
has
not
proposed,
for
openers.
and
secondly,
the
petitioner
acknowledges
at
page
33
of
their
brief
that
they
had
no
veto
power
over
the
settlement.
the
settlement
was
a
matter
for--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--correct.
according
to
their
version,
they're
taking--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--because
they're...
they're
taking
money
beyond
the
claim
for
medical
expense,
your
honor,
because
the
claim
for
medical
expense
is
not
measured
by
the
amount
of
the
medical
expenses
in
terms
of
its
value.
it
is
measured
by
the
various
factors
that
affect
the
value
of
a
claim,
of
which
the
payout
is
only
one
of
the
factors.
had
they
appeared
at
the
settlement
proceeding,
had
we
had--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--no,
your
honor.
the...
it
was
actually
not
a
proceeding,
and
i'd
have
to
go
outside
of
the
record
to
say
this,
but
if
the
case
was
settled,
as
most
cases
are,
by
exchange
of
telephone
calls
and
whether--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--i
do
not...
strictly
speaking,
no,
they
were
not
entitled
to
notice
because
the...
the
intervention
was
secondary
to
the
plaintiff's
claim.
that
is,
they
did
not
intervene
and
assert
the
independent
cause
of
action
that
the
statute
gave
them.
they
intervened
and
claimed
a
lien
upon
the
settlement's
recovery.
so
since
their
lien,
whatever
amount
that
lien
is,
was
derivative
of
the
plaintiff's
claim,
i
do
not
agree
that
they
had
to
be
notified
of
the...
that
the
case
had
been
settled
and
an
order
of
dismissal
was
entered.
mr.
h.
david
blair
yes,
there...
there
is...
there
is
a
general
provision
in
arkansas
law
that...
that
the
medicaid
recipients
assign
their
claim
to
notify
the
state
of
any
potential
liable
parties,
the
date
of
the
occurrence,
the
kind
of
injury
they
sustained,
the
information
that
would
enable
the
state
to
pursue
its
claim
should
it
decide
to
do
so.
and
in
this
instance,
the
state
decided
to
do
it
by
asserting
a
lien
upon
the...
the
common
law
action
asserted
in
the
state
court.
now,
if
the...
if
the
state
had
brought
an
independent
action
and
asserted
its...
its
right
to
recover,
rather
than
riding
in
the
wake
of
the
plaintiffs,
then
the
state
would
have
been
in
control
of
that
claim
and
been
in
control
of
settlement
and
whether
it
was
dismissed
or
not,
but--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
david
blair
the...
actually...
actually
there
was
never
a
formal
complaint
and
intervention
filed.
there
was
a
motion
for
leave
to
intervene.
it
was
never
followed
up
on.
again,
i'm
getting
outside
the
record
when
i
say
that.
mr.
h.
david
blair
it...
it
is
the
same
percentage
that
the
total
medicals
bore
to
what
we
agreed
was
a
fair
valuation
of
the
claim
or
what
we
agreed
there
would
be
evidence
to
support.
mr.
h.
david
blair
in
other
words,
the
state...
after
this
dispute
broke
out,
the
respondent
and
the
petitioner
reached
an
agreement
as
to
the
probable
value
of
the
claim,
absent
any
considerations
of
liability
or
financial
responsibility.
and,
of
course,
the
amount
of
the
medical
expenses
was
a
liquidated
sum,
and
that
made
it
real
easy
to
result
in
a
fraction.
and
the
$35,000
is
that
fraction
times
the
state's
payout.
mr.
h.
david
blair
correct.
mr.
h.
david
blair
your
honor--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--your
honor
has
put
his
finger
exactly
upon
the
problem
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
tremendous
question
of
liability.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
a
high
nuisance
value
settlement,
as
lawyers
refer
to
it.
mr.
h.
david
blair
the
claim
was...
the
$3
million
claim
was
not
the
amount
claimed
in
the
original
lawsuit,
which
never
got
to
the
point
of
a
claim
being
made.
it
was
for
damages
in
excess
of
diversity
limits,
the...
for
diversity
of
citizenship
limits.
there
was
not
a
$10
million
lawsuit
or
a
$20
million
lawsuit
or
an
$8
million
lawsuit.
the
$3
million
figure--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--no.
only...
the
only
requirement
is
that
there
be
an
allegation
that
it's
in
excess
of
diversity...
the
diversity
amount.
mr.
h.
david
blair
by
negotiation
with
the
respondents,
your
honor,
by...
by
looking
at
the...
the
damages,
the
physical
damages,
the
loss
of
earnings,
impairment
of
earning
capacity,
all
of
those
things.
and...
and
however
it's
phrased,
we
essentially
agreed
that
that
was
a
fair
value,
and
if
their
claim
is
limited
to
the
medical
expense
component,
they're
entitled
to
$35,000.
mr.
h.
david
blair
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
represented
by
the
terms
of
the
stipulation
entered
before
the
district
court,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
david
blair
yes.
mr.
h.
david
blair
the...
the
numbers
are
in
the
stipulation.
mr.
h.
david
blair
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
david
blair
there
was
no
agreement
with
the
respondent
and
the
tortfeasor
about
allocation
whatsoever.
the
idea
that
we
unilaterally
came
up
with
a
number
is...
is
not
correct.
it
was
a
lump
sum
amount,
and
when
the
state...
the
petitioner
and
respondents
couldn't
reach
an
agreement,
ultimately,
in
order
to
obviate
the
necessity
for
putting
on
evidence
of
damages
before
the
district
court,
so
the
court
would
have
a
factual
basis
to
make
this
allocation,
we
entered
into
a
stipulation.
and
that's
where
we
got
to
the
number
that
we
got
to.
mr.
h.
david
blair
has
a
duty
to
cooperate
with
the
assignee
to
the
extent
that
it
does
not
impair
the
assignor's
interest,
that
is--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--in...
in
this
particular
instance,
i
think
it
was
fulfilled
because
settlement
negotiations
resulted
in
$550,000
that
the
petitioners,
in
all
likelihood,
would
have
never
received--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--i
think
the
duty
to...
to
notify
the
assignee
would
be
true
insofar
as
proceeding
against
the
third
party
is
concerned.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
notification
to
the
assignee
would
serve
any
purpose
in
maximizing
the
total
recovery,
there
probably
is
a
duty,
but
notice
to
the
assignee
here
would
have
been
absolutely
of
no
value
insofar
as
the
common
interests
against
the
defendants
were
concerned.
mr.
h.
david
blair
in
retrospect,
your
honor,
they
would
have
been
plastered
with
notices.
mr.
h.
david
blair
as
a
practical
matter,
yes,
it
would...
it
would--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--it...
it
would
be
a
logistical
problem,
your
honor,
of--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--but...
but
the
certified
letter
saying
that
i'm
going
to
stipulate
with...
i'm
going
to
enter
into
settlement
negotiations
with
xyz
corporation,
would
not
really
have
served
any
purpose
unless
they
were
to
be
included
in
every
step
of
the
way,
because
these
settlement
negotiations
sometimes
extend
over
months
and
years
and...
and
some
of
they
seem
like
they
go
forever.
and
to
have
the...
the
state
at
the
injured
plaintiff's
side
throughout
all
of
that
step
would
be
a
logistical
problem.
and...
and
in
any
event,
it...
the
plaintiff
is
in
control
of
the
litigation.
the
state
has
no
right
to
say,
you
go
to
trial
or
you
don't
go
to
trial.
we
don't
agree
that
you're
getting
enough.
if...
if
you
go...
if
you
settle
at
this
figure,
we're
going
to
be
cut
short.
mr.
h.
david
blair
the...
the
insurance
company
potentially
would
have
double
liability
under
arkansas
law
if...
if
the
claim
is
settled
and
they
know
the
subrogation
claim
and--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--and
if
it's...
but
that's
this
unnamed
defendant's
particular
problem.
mr.
h.
david
blair
i...
i
cannot
comment
on
that,
your
honor,
since
that
has
not
been
the...
the
case--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--that...
that
may
be
the
result,
your
honor.
i...
i
cannot
foresee
all
of
the
ramifications
either
if
we
prevail
or
don't
prevail.
mr.
h.
david
blair
right.
and...
and
perhaps
if
we
prevail
and
the
state
elects
to
pursue
its
own
remedy
on
its
own,
we'll
have
another
round
of
litigation.
mr.
h.
david
blair
we
ultimately
rely
upon
the
text
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
irrespective
of
all
of
the
policy
or
the
political
arguments
that
have
been
made
to
the
court.
we
believe
and
have
maintained
throughout
that
the
text
of
the
statute
requires--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--first,
i
think
there's
no
question
that
heidi
ahlborn
owned
the
chose
in
action
because
under
arkansas
law
her
claim
was
complete
by
the
time
the
glass
and
the
metal
stopped
falling
to
the
highway.
secondly,
as
to
the
who
owned
the
proceeds
depends
upon
the
extent
to
which
the
state
was
allowed
to
take
an
assignment.
if
the
state
was
allowed
to
take
an
assignment
from
something
other
than
the
claim
for
medical
expenses,
then
they
owned
the
proceeds.
our
contention
is
that
the
state
was
only
allowed
to
take
an
assignment
under
the
language
of
the
statute
for
the
claim
for
medical
expenses,
and
in
that
case--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--yes.
mr.
h.
david
blair
the
federal
statute--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--we
lose
under
the
state
statute.
no
question.
mr.
h.
david
blair
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
david
blair
because
the
federal
question
involved
the
preemption
issue
as
to
whether
the
state
statute
had
been
preempted
by
the
anti
lien
statute.
mr.
h.
david
blair
correct.
that
is,
the...
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
action
we
believe
was
a
federal--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--a
federal
defense
does
not
support
the
federal
jurisdiction,
but
the
declaratory
judgment
act
gives
jurisdiction
over
federal
questions.
mr.
h.
david
blair
the
claim
that
was...
that
we
were
bringing
was
under
federal
law
in
that
we
were
claiming
the
arkansas
statute
was
invalid
by
reason
of
the
anti
lien
statute,
and
we
believed
that
that
presented
a
question
of
federal
law
and
therefore
brought
it--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--in
district
court.
which
hadn't
been
raised,
your
honor,
and
i'm
having
to
wing
it.
but
that's--
[laughter]
mr.
h.
david
blair
that's
correct.
that
was
our...
our
claim
before
the
district
court
that
ultimately
wound
up
in
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
h.
david
blair
i
believe
that
it
is
both.
i
think
that
the
assignment
provisions
limit
the
permissible
assignment
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
by
reason
of
the
anti
lien
statute.
mr.
h.
david
blair
other
than
its
language
as
to
what
it's
for.
mr.
h.
david
blair
yes.
mr.
h.
david
blair
payments...
the
right
to
payments
for
medical
care,
which
we
believe
is
the
language
of
limitation
in
that
the
state
is...
in
effect,
is
seeking
an
assignment
of
the
entire
cause
of
action
not
just
that
that
is
related
to
the
right
to
payment
for
medical
care,
which
is
simply
a
component
of
the
claim
that
may
have
5
cents
on
the
dollar
value
or
100
cents,
depending
on
what
the
facts
of
the
case
are.
mr.
h.
david
blair
in
the
absence
of
the
anti
lien
statute.
mr.
h.
david
blair
in
the
absence
of
the
anti
lien
statute,
the
state
statute
would
be,
in
my
opinion...
the
state
would
be
allowed
to
take
a
greater
lien
than
provided
by
federal
law.
but...
and
a
lien
statute
is
there,
and
we
say
that
that
is
the
stopping
point.
the
federal
anti
lien
statute
gives
protection
to
the
recipient's
property
as
to
which
these
assignment
statutes
are
an
implied
exception,
but
the
exception
must
be
limited
by
the--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--i...
i--
mr.
h.
david
blair
--i
say...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
say
that
that
is
a
fiction
because
what
it
attaches
to
is
the
cause
of
action
that
existed
instantly
at
the
time
of
the
injury,
and
so
say,
no,
you
don't
own
that
because
it
was
assigned
to
us.
well,
we
had
to
have
something
to
assign,
otherwise
assignment
was
meaningless.
we...
in...
in
summation,
as
i
see
the
white
light
is
on,
we
believe
that
this
case...
and
it
is
respondent's
position
that
these
three
statutes
that
we
have
been
discussing
here
are
plain
and
unambiguous
and
that
the
case
should
be
resolved
upon
the
basis
of
the
statutory
language.
and
we...
it
is
further
respondent's
position
that
if
the
case
is
resolved
on
the
basis
of
the
statutory
language,
the
eighth
circuit
reached
a
very
correct
analysis
of
the
language
and
the
results
that
that
takes
place.
there
is
no
ambiguity,
and
under
the
first
step
of
the
chevron
case,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction
within
the
terms
of
the
statutes
which,
read
together,
are
unambiguous
and
plain.
they
get
an
assignment
for
the
claim
for
medical
care
services.
the
anti
lien
statute
shields
the
rest.
thank
you
very
much.
