justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
dismissed
on
the
basis
that
they...
they
don't
have
a
cause
of
action
because
they've
assigned
it?
justice
antonin

ms.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--ms.
millett,
you've
been
trying
to
tell
us
the
difficulties
that
the
state
would
have
in
bringing
suit
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
they?
i
see
your
white
light
is
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
like
to
hear
what
they
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
incentive
does
she
have
to
cooperate
in
that
later
action?
and
isn't
it
the
fact
that
she
would
have
a
disincentive
to
cooperate
if
she's
going
to
have
to
reimburse
the
insurance
companies
for
any
additional
compensation
that
they
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it...
but...
but
don't
some
of
the
insurance
policies
require
that
if
the
insurance
company,
which
has
settled
the
first
claim,
ends
up
paying...
paying
additional
money,
that
that...
that
that
amount
of
money
would
be
the...
the
responsibility
of
the...
of
the
claimant?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
a
disincentive
on
her
part.
she
doesn't
want
the
insurance
company
to
lose
any
more
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
very
strange
system
for
the
federal
government
to
set
up
and
to...
to...
i
mean,
to...
to
subsidize...
to
reward
the
failure
of
the...
of
the
medicaid
benefit...
beneficiary
to
cooperate.
there's
a
statutory
responsibility
for
her
to
cooperate,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
she
didn't
do
that
here
because
she
just
went
ahead
and
settled
without...
without
giving
the
state
notice.
justice
antonin
scalia
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
state
is
a
party
to
the
proceeding,
and
she
goes
ahead
and
get
the
proceeding
dismissed
without
even
telling
the
state,
and
that...
that
isn't
included
in
the...
the
responsibility
to
cooperate?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
complaint...
the...
the
intervention
by
the
state
claimed
only
a
lien?
is
that
what
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--document
claimed?
intervention--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
the...
the
other
thing
that
you're...
you're
dividing
that
against
is
not
liquidated.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
nobody...
i
mean,
the...
where
there's
room
for...
for
compromise
is
certainly
in
the
pain
and
suffering
part
of
a
settlement,
not
in
the
medicals.
i
mean,
the
medicals
are
a
given
in
any
settlement
i've
ever
heard
of.
there
it
is,
black
on
white.
this
is
how
much
was
paid.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
compromise.
unless
there's
a...
you
know,
a
compromise
on
whether
there's
liability
or
not,
but...
but
whether,
if
there
is
liability,
this
amount
is
owing,
that's...
that's
a
given
for
the
medicals.
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't...
wouldn't
the
insurance
company
have
to
worry
about
the
same
problem?
that
is
to
say,
even
if
it's
not
your
problem
by
reason
of
our
coming
out
the
way
you
would
like
us
to,
wouldn't
it
remain
a
problem
for
the
insurance
company
so
they
could
not
enter
into
any
settlement
until
they
knew
that
the
state
would
go
along
with...
with
the
division
between
medicals
and...
and
other
damages?
that...
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
doesn't
it
become
a
problem
for
the
insurance
company
to
somehow
bring
in
the
state
in
the
process
of
the
settlement?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
once...
once
the...
once
the...
the
foolish
insurance
company
figures
out
that
that
is
what
is
going
to
happen,
future
settlements
will
be
very
difficult
i
would
gather.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
argument
is
if
it
is
six
in
one,
half...
half
a
dozen
in
the
other,
we
should
do
it
your
way
because
that's
what
the
text
of
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
the
federal
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
the
state
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
statute
clearly
goes
beyond
that
and
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i
assume
the
state...
the
state
tries
to
get
around
that
by
saying
it
never...
never
became
the
property
of
your
client,
that
by
reason
of
the
assignment
provision,
all
choses
in
action
automatically
vest
in
the
state,
causes
of
action
arising
out
of
transactions
in
which
there's
a
claim
for
medicaid
compensation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say...
you
say
they
can't
do
that
because,
at
the
time
the
accident
occurs,
you
don't
even
know
that
there's
going
to
be
a
claim--
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
really
didn't
understand
that
argument.
does
the
state
deduct
from
its
medicaid
funds
the
amount
that
it
pays
lawyers
to
conduct
medicaid
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
it
doesn't
matter
as
far
as
the
medicaid
funds
are
concerned.
it
comes
out
of
general
state
revenues.
right?
