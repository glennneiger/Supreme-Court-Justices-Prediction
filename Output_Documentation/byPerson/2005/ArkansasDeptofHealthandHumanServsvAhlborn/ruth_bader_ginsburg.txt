justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're...
you're
talking
without
reference
to
the
statute,
and
as
i
read
the
statute,
the
phrase
that
keeps
reappearing
is
payments
made
by
a
third
party
for
health
care
items
or
services.
so
she
has
to
turn
over
from
her
recovery
what
she
got
for
health
care,
but
we
know
that
her
tort
claim
consisted
of
a
lot
more.
so
if
the
federal
statute
says
she
has
to
turn
over
what
she
received
from
the
third
party
for
health
care
services,
well,
she
did
that,
and
you
agreed
that
that
would
be
a
fair
allocation.
so
i
don't
see
how
you
get
from
her
the...
a
much
larger
share
than
what
she
got
for
health
care.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
state...
the
state
could
sue
in
the
first
instance.
in
fact,
if
you
just
read
the
text
of
the
statute,
it
seems
like
the
state
is
the
one
envisioned
to
be
suing
for
reimbursement
of
the
medical
expenses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
state
was
in
this
case.
the
state
intervened.
so
it
was
party
to
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
when
it...
it
found
out
about
the
dismissal,
why
didn't
it
go
right
into
the
arkansas
court
and
say,
you
forgot
about
us?
we
were
a
party
to
this
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
they
be
fighting
the
same
anti
lien
provision?
they
would
be...
wouldn't
they
be
saying
we
have
a
claim
for
all
of
the
medical
expenses?
and
no
other
party...
the
injury
victim
didn't
have
authority
from
us
to
compromise
our
claim.
it's
for
us
to
compromise
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did...
did
they
have
notice
of
the
settlement
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were...
and
they
were
intervened
in
this
lawsuit.
weren't
they
entitled
to
have
notice
that
there
was
a
settlement
and
that
the
case
was
going
to
be
dismissed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
plaintiff
had...
had
no
obligation
to
notify
the
state?
there
was
some
mention
of
a...
of
a
obligation
to
cooperate.
is
there
any
statutory
obligation
under...
i
don't
see
it
in
the
medicaid
statute,
but
under
arkansas
law
for...
for
the
medicaid
recipient
to
cooperate
with
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
still
have
a
declaration
that
the
arkansas
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
conflicted
with
the
federal
statute?
