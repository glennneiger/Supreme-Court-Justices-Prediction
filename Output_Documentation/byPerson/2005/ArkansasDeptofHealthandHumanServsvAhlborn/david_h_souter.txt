justice
david
h.
souter
why
didn't
arkansas--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
why
don't
we
just
send
you
back
to
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
why
are
we
going
through
this...
this
proceeding
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i...
i
realize
that.
but
at...
at
the
end
of
the
day,
you
want
your
money,
and...
and
i
don't
see
why
you
can't
get
your
money
simply
by
going
back
into
the
state
court.
maybe...
maybe
lapse
of
time
bars
you
at
this
point.
but
presumably
you
could
have
avoided
all
of
this
by
simply
saying,
we
didn't
agree
to
the
settlement.
we're
still
here.
we
want
our...
the...
the
remainder
of
our
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wouldn't
it
have
been
easier
to
do
that
than
come
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
her
response
to
that
argument,
look,
i've...
i've
assigned
you
my
rights?
there's
no
question
about
that.
i'm
also
willing
to
give
you
whatever
the
amount
is
that
they
allocated.
if...
if
you
want
the
difference,
you've
got
the
assignment.
go
ahead
and
sue
for
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
that
would
be
consistent
with
the...
with
the
statute.
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
but
i...
i'm
not
saying
that
it...
it
does.
the
state
can
do
nothing
if
it
wants
to.
but
the
statute
that
you
just
quoted
requires
her
to
assign
to
the
state
her
right
to
recover
for...
for
her
medical
expenses.
she
says,
i
have
done
that.
in
fact,
i've
done
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
under
arkansas
law.
you've
got
your
assignment.
number
two,
i'm
giving
you
the
portion
of
the
recovery
that
i
got
with
respect
to
medical
payments.
you
can
have
it.
now,
there's
a
difference
between
what
you
paid
and
what
i
got
attributable
to
medical
payments,
an
amount,
by
the
way,
which
you
stipulated
was
correct.
so
if
you
want
the
difference,
sue
for
it.
go
ahead.
it's
fine
with
me.
why
isn't
that
the
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're...
you're
basing
your
argument
on
this
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
let
me
come
back
to
my
question.
this
statute
simply
says
that
she
will
assign
her
rights
to
recover
for
the
medicals.
she
has
done
that.
she
has
also
given
you
the
portion
of
the
settlement
which
she
and
you
agree
is
attributable
to
the
medicals.
why
isn't
the
statute
satisfied
if
she
simply
says,
you've
got
your
assignment?
if
you
want
the
difference
between
what
i've
given
you
and
your
out
of
pocket
expense,
sue.
you
have
the
assignment.
you
have
the
right.
go
ahead
and
sue
for
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
an
entirely
different
argument.
the
question
is
what
does
the
statute
require
her
to
do
and
entitle
you
to
do.
and
i
don't
see
why,
under
the
statute,
the
statute
is
not
satisfied
if
you
simply
sue
for
the
difference
under...
under
your
assignment
of
her
rights.
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
the
assignment
allow
you
to
bring
a
lawsuit?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
you
bring
it?
i
mean,
the
answer
to
the...
to
the
statutory
point,
it
seems
to
me,
is
you've
got
your
assignment.
if
you're
not
whole
yet,
sue.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what?
you
can
sue
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it
her
incentive
to
reduce
recovery?
she
may
not
be
getting
anything
more,
but
why
does
she
have
incentive
to
reduce
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
thought
she
and
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
insofar
as
the
suit
against
the
defendant
is
concerned,
she's
not...
she
does
not
have
an
interest
in
minimizing.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
suppose
if
the
insurance
company
heard
from
the
state
that
the
state
continued
to...
would
continue
to
pursue
its
claim,
in
the
absence
either
of
a
more
generous
assignment
or
a
more
generous
settlement,
there
might
not
have
been
a
settlement.
justice
david
h.
souter
roughly
speaking...
i...
i'm...
there
may
be
a
few
dollars
and
cents
that...
that
aren't
accounted
for
here.
but
roughly
speaking,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
amount
that...
that
you
and...
and,
for
that
matter,
the
state
attribute
to
the
medicals
out
of
the
total
settlement
is
the
same
proportion
that
the
claim
for
medicals
bore
to
the
total
original
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
in
a
case
like
this,
then
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
someone
like
your
client
to
make
a
claim
not
of
$3
million
but
of
$6
million.
then
if
you
settle
for
exactly
the
same
amount
of
money
you
settled
for
here,
the
percentage
of
the
medicals...
the
amount
attributed
to
medicals
would
be
exactly
one
half
of
what
it
is
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
the
original
state
lawsuit,
did
you
have
to
state
an
addendum?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
did...
then...
then
tell
me
again
where
we
got
the
$3
million
figure.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is...
is
that
in...
is
that
in
writing,
along
with
the
allocation--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
i
mean,
is
that
part
of
the
stipulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
nothing
in
the
assignment
provision
as
such
that
limits
it,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
said...
i'm
looking
at
1396k(a)(1)(a),
which
refers
to
assign
to
the
state
any
rights
to
payment
for
medical
care
from
any
third
party.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
limitation
in
that.
