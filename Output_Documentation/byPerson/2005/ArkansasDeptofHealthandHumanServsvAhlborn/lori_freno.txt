ms.
lori
freno
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
parties
agree
that
medicaid
paid
over
$215,000
to
cover
the
costs
of
medical
care
provided
to
ms.
ahlborn
that
resulted
from
an
auto
accident
that
she
was
involved
in.
the
parties
also
agree
that
the
petitioner,
the
arkansas
department
of
health
and
human
services,
may
place
a
lien
on
some
portion
of
the
third
party
settlement
proceeds
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
they
disagree,
however,
as
to
what
extent
that
lien
may
reach
into
the
third
party
settlement
proceeds
in
this
case.
the
respondent,
without
notifying
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
finalized
a
settlement
with
the
remaining
tortfeasor
accepting
$550,000
as
a
compromised
settlement
for
a
claim
that
she
had
originally
valued
at
over
$3
million.
ms.
lori
freno
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
arkansas
did
intervene
in
the
lawsuit.
ms.
lori
freno
well,
your
honor,
after...
at
the
point
that
arkansas
learned
about
the
settlement,
the
case
had
already
been
dismissed
out
of
state
court
with
prejudice,
and
the
respondent
notified
the
department
that
if
it
would
not
accept...
it
would
not
compromise
its
medicaid
claim,
that
they
would
be
filing
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
federal
court
to
resolve
the
anti
lien
question.
and
that
is
how
we
ended
up
in
federal
court.
ms.
lori
freno
they...
it
did
not
get
notice
of
the
dismissal.
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
we
do
not
know
what
happened,
but
we
did
not
get
notice
of
the
dismissal
until
after
the
case
was
dismissed.
ms.
lori
freno
arguably
arkansas
could
have
attempted
to
get
the
case
reopened
in
state
court,
but
the
petitioner...
i'm
sorry...
the
respondent
in
this
case
selected
the
federal
forum
to
resolve
the
issue.
ms.
lori
freno
well,
your
honor--
ms.
lori
freno
--i'm
not
familiar
with
the
terms
of
the
settlement
agreement,
but
i
would
assume
that
if
arkansas
would
have
sued
the
defendant
for
the
remainder,
that
there
would
have
been
an
indemnification
clause
in
the
settlement
agreement,
which
means
that
the
money
would
have
ended
up
coming
right
out
of
ms.
ahlborn's
pocket
in
any
event.
ms.
lori
freno
your
honor--
ms.
lori
freno
--that
is
exactly
what
happened.
they
did
settle
the
claim
out
from
under
the
department.
ms.
lori
freno
we
don't...
well,
we
don't
know
how
that
can
be.
we
don't
know
why
the...
we
do
not
know
why
the
state
court
dismissed
the
action.
ms.
lori
freno
as
a
matter
of
arkansas
law,
a
claim
should
not
be
dismissed
until
all
parties
are...
the
rights
of
all
parties
are
determined.
ms.
lori
freno
i'm
sorry?
ms.
lori
freno
well,
if...
in
fact,
there
is
an
arkansas
statute
that
if
monies
that
belong
to
the
department
are
distributed
in
a...
in
a
manner
that
is
inconsistent,
you
know,
with
the
interests
of
the
department,
that
it
can
pursue
either
the
medicaid
recipient,
her
guardian,
her
attorney,
or
anyone
else
for
that
money.
ms.
lori
freno
because--
ms.
lori
freno
--the
reason
we're
going
through
the
proceeding
here,
your
honor,
is
because
the
issue
of
the
anti
lien
provision
was
raised.
that
was
not
raised
in
state
court.
it
was
brought
in
federal
court
as
a
part
of
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
ms.
lori
freno
your
honor,
we
could
have
proceeded
in
state
court
if
we
wished.
the
state,
of
course,
has
limited
resources,
and
we
learned
that
the--
ms.
lori
freno
--we
never
expected
to
get,
frankly,
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
but
we
did
understand
that
we
would
be--
ms.
lori
freno
--before
the
federal
district...
i'm
sorry?
ms.
lori
freno
yes.
ms.
lori
freno
oh,
i
thought
you
meant
at
the
time
that
the
state
court
case
was
dismissed.
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
the
question.
ms.
lori
freno
yes.
ms.
lori
freno
your
honor,
the
third
party
liability
provisions
of
federal
medicaid
law
is
what
governs
this
case,
and
those
statutes
require
that
the
states
seek...
seek
reimbursement
from
liable
third
parties
for
medical
costs
for
the
full
amount
of
that
liability.
now,
as
a...
a
condition
of
ms.
ahlborn's
eligibility...
or
as
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
medicaid,
ms.
ahlborn
had
to
assign
to
the
state
her
right
to
payment
for
medical
costs...
her
right
to
payment
for
medical
costs.
consequently,
when
she
assigned
that
right
to
the
state,
it
was
synonymous
with
what
the
state
itself
had
to
do,
which
was
seek
full
reimbursement
from
liable
third
parties
to
the
extent
of
the
third
parties'
legal
liability.
ms.
lori
freno
yes,
she
could,
your
honor,
and
in
fact,
that
is
what
the
majority--
ms.
lori
freno
--yes,
your
honor.
and
that
is
what
the
majority
of
the
medicaid
recipients
in
our
state
choose
to
do.
they
prefer
to
pursue
the
action
on
their
own
and
in
the
end
just
reimburse
the
medicaid
program.
ms.
lori
freno
well,
they...
she
is
basically...
a
recipient
is
pursuing
the
cause
of
action
with
the...
the
approval
of
the
state.
and
also,
in
the
third
party
liability
provisions,
it's
important
to
recognize
that
they
provide...
they
include
a
duty
of
cooperation
that
the
recipient
has
to
cooperate
with
the
state
in
seeking
full
medicaid
reimbursement.
so
the
third...
the
federal
third
party
liability
provisions
basically
consider
the
recipient
and
the
state
to
be
a
team,
a
team
that
is
out
to
get
full
reimbursement.
ms.
lori
freno
your
honor,
what
the
statute
requires...
this
is
in
the
petitioners'
brief
on
pages
2
and
3...
at
42
u.s.c.
1396k(a)(1)(a),
which
is
the
section
that
talks
about
the
scope
of
the
assignment,
she
has
to
assign
her
rights
to
payment
for
medical
care,
not
payments
that
she
actually
receives
for
medical
care.
and
what
are
her
rights
to
payment
for
medical
care?
if
we
would
take
this
out
of
the
medicaid
context
and
put
it
in
a
standard
tort
context,
someone
who's
injured
by
a
third
party
has
a
right
to
receive
all
the
money
that
she
is
out
due
to
the
fact
that
she
was
injured
by
the
third
party.
ms.
lori
freno
there
is
nothing,
though,
in
the--
ms.
lori
freno
--the
third
party
liability
provisions
do
not
require
the
state
to
ever
seek
reimbursement
through
the
direct--
ms.
lori
freno
--ms....
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
stipulation,
your
honor,
the
parties
have
always
agreed
that
medicaid
paid
over
$214,000--
ms.
lori
freno
--for
ms.
ahlborn's
damages.
the
state
is
in
no
way
trying
to
take
anything
from
the
third
party
settlement
proceeds
that
represents...
that
represents
payment
for
anything
other
than
what
is
necessary
to
reimburse
the
state
for
that
amount
of
money.
ms.
lori
freno
yes.
ms.
lori
freno
because
she
assigned,
your
honor,
her
right
to
recover...
or
her
right
for
payments
from
third
parties,
she
no
longer
has
the
right
to
compromise
the
state's
claim.
ms....
the
respondent
does
not
have--
ms.
lori
freno
--there's...
under
the
statute,
her
assignment...
she
has
a
duty
of
cooperation,
first
of
all,
to
cooperate
with
the
state
in
receiving
these
recoveries.
the
assignment
allows
her
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
it
does
not
require
her
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
primarily
the
obligation
is
on
the
state
to
sue--
ms.
lori
freno
--yes,
the
assignment
allows--
ms.
lori
freno
--but
she...
she
opted
to
bring
the...
she
opted
to
bring
the
lawsuit
on
her
own.
and
the
point
i
was
making
earlier--
ms.
lori
freno
--we
could
sue,
but
the
state
has
limited
resources.
every
penny--
ms.
lori
freno
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
encompassed
within
state
law.
ms.
lori
freno
in
that
situation,
then
the...
the
case
would
just
have
to
go
forward
to
litigation.
and
yes,
the
state,
if
it
wished
to
pursue--
ms.
lori
freno
--would
you
repeat
that?
i'm
sorry.
ms.
lori
freno
the...
the
medicaid
recipient
can
never
compromise
the
claim
of
the
state.
ms.
lori
freno
pardon
me?
ms.
lori
freno
well,
she...
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
she
can...
she
can
compromise
her
own
claim.
she
cannot
compromise
the
state's.
if
she
wants--
ms.
lori
freno
--no.
state
law
cannot
go,
your
honor,
beyond
federal
law,
and
federal
law
allows
the
state
to
receive
full
reimbursement
to
the
extent
of
the
third
party's
liability.
ms.
lori
freno
i'm
sorry.
would
you
repeat
that?
ms.
lori
freno
yes.
ms.
lori
freno
if
medicaid...
medicaid
law
does
require
full
reimbursement.
but
if
this
court
determined
that
medicaid
law
did
not
require
full
reimbursement
from...
to
the
extent
of
a
third
party's
liability,
well,
then
there
would
not
be
an
anti
lien...
there
would
not
be
an
anti
lien
provision
question.
but
federal
law
does
require
the
state
to
seek
full
reimbursement
to
the
extent
of
the
third
party's
liability.
ms.
lori
freno
no,
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
arkansas
law
must
stay
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
law.
arkansas
law
cannot
require
a
recipient
to
assign--
ms.
lori
freno
--that
would
be
correct.
ms.
lori
freno
it
would
be
because
of
the
anti
lien
provision.
but
because
she
assigned
to
payment
for
medical
care,
that...
the
anti
lien
provision
doesn't
operate
with
regard
to
that
amount
of
money
that
is
recovered
from
a
third
party
in
a...
in
a
third
party
settlement.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
lori
freno
thank
you.
ms.
lori
freno
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
default
rule,
that
rule
being
that
unless
the
state
is
invited
into
the
negotiations,
that
liability...
the
extent
of
the
liability
of
the
third
party
can
be
considered
to
be
100...
the
full
amount
that
medicaid
had
to
pay...
that
is
a
very
important
rule.
and
it
makes
sense
because
money
that
has
to
be
spent...
there
was
a
suggestion
of
post
settlement
hearings
to
determine
what
portion
of
the
money
is
for...
for
medical
costs
and
what
is
for
something
else.
such
hearings
would
be
incredibly
expensive,
horribly
inconvenient.
the
state
would
have
to,
you
know,
burden...
shoulder
this
burden,
and
this
is
money
that
could
be
going
into
the
medicaid
program.
every
dollar
that's
recovered
from
liable
third
parties
is
put
back
into
the
medicaid
program,
and
if
the
state
has
to
keep
hiring
more
lawyers
and
has
to
have
administrative
hearings
or
proceeding
in
judiciary
proceedings
to
determine
what
part
of
a
settlement
constitutes
a
payment,
then
that...
that
is
just
a
very
inefficient
use
of...
of
very
limited
federal...
or
state
funds.
i
heard
a
comment
in
mr.
blair's
argument
that
arkansas
law...
i
think
it
was--
ms.
lori
freno
--no,
it
does
not,
and
it--
ms.
lori
freno
--it
comes
out
of
general
state
revenues,
but
the
amount
of
general
state
revenues
that
are
there
are
what
is
available
to
put
back
into
the
medicaid
fund.
also,
arkansas
law
does
not
require
an
assignment
of
a
cause
of
action.
arkansas
law
is
very
clear
on
that
point,
and
that's
set
forth
in
20-77-301,
which
is
at...
in...
at
the
cert
petition
appendix
at
page
38.
it
specifically
states
that
any
action
taken
by
the
state
cannot
be
a
bar
to
any
action
brought
on
behalf
of
the
recipient.
ms.
lori
freno
thank
you.
