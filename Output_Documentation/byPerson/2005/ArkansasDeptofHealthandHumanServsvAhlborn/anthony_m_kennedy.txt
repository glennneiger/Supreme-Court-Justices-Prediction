justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me?
it's
my...
excuse
me.
my
understanding
was
that
arkansas
had
intervened
in
the
suit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
after
the
settlement,
i
take
it
arkansas
would...
still
would
have
had
the
right
to...
to
pursue
its
claim
in
the
litigation,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
can
they
do
that
with...
with
a
party?
i
mean,
the...
and
the
reason...
the
reason
i
ask
is
it
seems
to
me
that
you
still
have
the
cause
of
action
left.
maybe
that
would
be
my
next
question.
suppose
there's
a
settlement
and
you
don't
get,
in
the
settlement,
even
earmarks,
medical
specialists,
plus
general
damages,
and
you're...
you're
unsatisfied.
don't
you
still
have
the
right
under
arkansas
law...
or
do
you...
to
pursue
the
tortfeasor
for
the
balance
that's
owed
to
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we're
asking
how
that
can
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
asking
you
as
a
matter
of
arkansas
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
this
question
so
far
as
the
rights
of
the
assignee
and
the
assignor.
suppose
it's
a
very
weak
case
and
the
litigant
says
i
want
to
settle
for
20
cents
on
the
dollar.
are
you
saying
that
there's
some
kind
of
duty
to
notify
the
state
and...
and
to
consult
with
the
state
before
this
is
done?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
suppose
the...
the
state
says,
well,
we...
we
don't...
we
don't
agree
with
you.
then...
then
what
happens?
then
they're
at
loggerheads
and
you
go
to
justice
souter's
position
i
suppose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would...
would
it...
if...
suppose
in
the
instance
i
put
they...
the...
the
state
has...
has
an
objection,
but
the
settlement
is
made,
nonetheless,
for
20
cents
on
the
dollar.
do
you
still
think
you
have
the
right
to
receive
100
percent
of
your
payment
from
the
proceeds
in
the
case
that
i
put?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume
that
it's
a
very
weak
case.
they
settle
for
20
cents
on
the
dollar.
do
you
have
the
right,
as
you
understand
the
law,
to
insist
that
you
receive
100
percent
of
your
payments
from
the
gross
settlement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
answer
is
yes,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
answer
is
yes,
i
take
it.
in
the
case
i
put,
the
answer
is
you
would
think
that
you're
entitled
to
100
percent
of
your
payments.
so
that
eats
into
her
general
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
why
does
there
have
to
be
enough
money
in
the...
take...
take
the...
the
case
that
we...
we
put
to
your
cocounsel.
suppose
it's
a
settlement
for
20
cents
on
the
dollar.
does
the...
does
the
state
have
an
absolute
right
to
get
reimbursement
for
100
percent
by
invading
the
general
damages
portion
of
the
settlement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
in
my...
can
you
answer
the...
the
question?
you
have
the
problem.
they
settle
for
20
cents
on
the
dollar.
does
the
state
in
that
case
have
an
absolute
right
to
a
lien
or
a
claim
or
to
a
demand
for
the...
for
the
proceeds
in...
for
the
balance
of
the
80...
for
the
80
percent
balance
of
the
medical
costs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
is...
that
is
as
between
the
state
and
the
third
party
tortfeasor,
not
between
the
state
and...
and
the
medicare
recipient,
i
should
think.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
if
your
rule
is
just
one
that
you
have
to
pay
the
100
percent
if
there's
non
cooperation
and
a
non
notice,
that's
one
thing.
but
the
briefs,
it
seems
to
me,
indicate
that
you
have
an
absolute
right
to
100
percent.
and
those
are
two
very
different
propositions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
know
in
the
case
of
a
jury.
but
our
question
is
what
happens
if
there's
a
settlement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
state
was
involved
but
disagreed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
state...
suppose
the
state
is
involved
in
the
negotiations
and
they
disagree.
the...
the
parties
in
good
faith
say,
we've
got
to
settle
this
for
20
percent.
the
state
said,
oh,
your
case
is
much
better
than
that.
please
don't
settle.
then
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
has
notice.
it's
involved,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
under
arkansas
law
that
the
injured
party
as
an
assignor
has
a
duty
to
cooperate
with
the
assignee
in
pursuing
the
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
duty
fulfilled
by...
by
entering
settlement
negotiations
and
not
even
notifying
the
assignee?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
there's
no
duty
to
notify
the
assignee
if
you
think
you
might
get
a
pretty
good
result
for
yourself.
i
don't
understand
that
as
much
of...
much
of
a
duty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
certainly
would
have
avoided
about
20
minutes
of
questions
in
this
court.
[laughter]
