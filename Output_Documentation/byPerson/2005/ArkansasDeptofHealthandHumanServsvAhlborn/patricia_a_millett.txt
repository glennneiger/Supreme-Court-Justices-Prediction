ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
excuse
me.
the
problem
in
this
case...
and
it's
a
common
one...
is
when
private
parties,
beneficiaries,
sue
first
and
run
the
well
dry.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
settlement
includes
the
payment
for
medical
care
that
she
was
entitled
to
and
the
one
she
assigned
to
the
state.
that
is
not
in
dispute.
the
question
is
the
amount,
and
the
amount
is
very
much
in
dispute.
the...
the
position
of
the
beneficiary
is
that
the
amount
that
is
medical
payment
is
the
amount
that
we
unilaterally
decide
is
the
share
of
medical
payments
in
the
settlement.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
there
are
two
options.
one
would,
of
course,
be
to
have
an
agreement
on
resolution
of
the
medical
claim,
which
would
require
notice
and
involvement
of
the
state.
the
state
could
act
here.
the
other
option
is
if
they're
at
loggerheads,
for
it
to
be
clear
up
front
amongst
all
the
parties
that
the...
the
settlement
isn't
resolving
all
the
third
party
liability.
it...
the...
the
question
of
liability
for
medical
care,
or
at
least
the
state's
claim
for
medical
care...
sometimes
they
have
their
own...
is
still
open,
and
there
has
to
be
enough
money
left
in
the
well.
there
were
two
insurance
policies
here
that
were
paid
at
their
caps.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
the
state
has...
and
the
medicaid
statute
is
quite
clear.
they
have
an
entitlement
to
payments
for
medical
care,
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
not
straight
out,
but
what
they...
they
have
the
right
to
make
their
own
decision
and
compromise
their
own
claim.
the
beneficiary
may
think
it's
20
cents
on
the
dollar.
the
state
may
think...
the
state
can
consider
two
things
and
two
things
only.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
not
when...
not...
not
when
the
settlement,
as
here,
involves
the
complete
claim.
there's
never
been
a
claim
by
the
beneficiaries
here
that
there's
something
left
under
state
law
to
do
or
something
left
in
the
well
to
go
get
on
the
part
of
the
state.
but
let...
if
i...
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
why
these
suits
against
the...
or
a
state
could
decide...
and
the
anti
lien
decision
does
not
compel
the
state
to
decide
otherwise.
a
state,
with
its
discretion
under
medicaid,
could
decide
that
pursuing
third
parties
is
not
viable.
this
is
not
an
ordinary
assignment.
this
is
an
assignment
with
strong
duties
of
cooperation
required
on
the
part
of
the
beneficiary.
now,
what
does
the
lawsuit
look
like
when
the
state
goes,
after
the
settlement,
against
the
third
party
tortfeasor
here?
the
state
has
no
control
of
evidence.
it
has
a
pile
of
bills,
none
of
the
relevant
evidence.
at
the
point
of
this
lawsuit,
the
beneficiary's
interests
are
adverse
to
the
state's.
they're
not
in
a
cooperative
mode.
they're
interested
in--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--two
answers,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
a
lot
of
times,
the
plaintiffs
have
already
started
these
lawsuits
of
these
claims
long
before...
when
the
state
has
just
started
getting
up
the
process
of
paying
the
medical
bills.
and
car
accidents
and
stuff
can
get
taken
care
of
pretty
quickly.
and
the...
the
second
point
is,
is
that
the
state...
the
state
may...
needs
the
help
of
the
beneficiary
to
bring
the
suit.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
they...
they
could
have,
and
they'd
be...
they'd
be
fighting
the
same
anti
lien
issue
there
that
they
ended
up
fighting
in
federal
court.
but
there's
one
other
thing
too.
keep
in
mind
these
third
party
liability
provisions--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
right.
they
would
say
that,
and...
and
the...
and
where...
where
the
parties
came
at
loggerheads
here
was...
their
position
is
medical
claim
is
in
here.
it's
in
this
pot.
that's
not
in
dispute.
it's
in
here.
how
much
do
you
get?
do
you
get
the
amount
that
we
unilaterally
designate,
or
can
the
state
have
a
default
rule
that
says
when
you
cut
us
out
and
we
no
longer
have
a
means
of
litigating
in
cooperation
with
you
to
make
a
reasoned
judgment
as
to
what
the
fair
medical
payment
is
in
this
settlement,
can
we
insist
upon
100
percent?
otherwise,
there's
two
things
happening.
the...
the
beneficiary
should
not
be
better
off
for
having
cut
the
state
out
of
the
process,
but
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
our
position
is
the
100
percent
claim...
the
default...
as
a
default
rule,
when
the
state
has
been
cut
out
and
cannot
make
the
reasoned
judgment
that
the
medicaid
statute
charges
the
state
with
making
on
these
claims,
that's
a
100
percent
rule.
quite...
our
position,
quite
straightforwardly,
is
if
the
state
was
involved
or
if
there
was
a
jury
finding
of
50/50,
you
know,
comparative
negligence,
then
the
medicaid
claim
gets
cut
in
half
because
it...
the...
the
state
can
consider
two
things,
extent
of
liability
and
cost--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it's...
no.
and...
and
if
there's
a
settlement
in
which
the
state
is
not
involved
but
the
medical
bill
is
compromised...
so
it's
not
out
there
to
be
recovered...
the
medical
bill--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
depends
on
whether
the
state
was
involved
in
making
that
judgment.
if
the
state
was
cut
out
of
making
that
judgment,
the
state
can
choose
to
have
a
default
rule.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i'm
sorry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
the
state...
the
state
should
be
entitled
to
a
100
percent
rule
because...
for
two
reasons.
one,
there
is
no
way
post
hoc...
or
no...
a
state
can
decide
there's
no
reliable
way
post
hoc
to
figure
out
how
much
of
this
truly
was
a
payment
for
medical
care.
i
mean,
stop
and
think.
medical--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
no.
what
was
stipulated...
and
i
think
you
have
to
read
the
stipulation
very
carefully.
there
is
no
stipulation
in
there
that
the
state
agrees
that
$35,000
is
an
accurate
assessment
of
medical
liability.
the
stipulation
says--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no.
the...
the
difference
is
it's
who
makes
the
compromise
decision.
and
the
stipulation
is...
from
the
beneficiary's
view,
they
obviously
made
a
compromise
decision.
they
did
an
across
the
board
sort
of
mathematical
reduction
of
this
claim,
and
they
didn't
sort
of
stop
and
think
about
what's
more
easily
proven,
medical
claims
or
pain
and
suffering.
what's
more
easily
documented.
they
didn't
do...
it's
just
a
mathematical
reduction.
the
state
never
said
that's
accurate.
the
state
said,
if
you
win,
your
statutory
construction
argument,
which
is
the
amount
that
you
unilaterally
designate
as
medical
care,
is
what
we're
stuck
with.
and
if
we
try
to
take
more,
it
violates
the
anti
lien
provision.
that's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
then
at
that
point,
what
should
happen
is
there
can
be
a...
the...
the
beneficiary
can
go
ahead
and
resolve
her
other
claims.
but
everybody
has
to
be
on
notice.
those
third
parties,
in
particular,
have
to
be
on
notice
that
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
game.
you
still...
this
does
not--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--cover
medical
payments.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
the
first
one,
obviously,...
there's
three.
the
first
one
is
evidence
control.
the
state
has
a
pile
of
bills
but
no
evidence
about
liability.
now,
beforehand,
if
they're
involved,
their...
their
interests
and
the
beneficiary's
are
aligned
to
maximize
recovery.
after
the
fact,
the
state
is
going
to
go
in,
either
at
a
post
hoc
hearing
with
the
beneficiary
or
try
to
sue
some
third
party,
and
the
beneficiary
is
going
to
say,
oh,
i
fell
asleep
at
the
wheel,
i
was
on
my
cell
phone,
i
had
preexisting
conditions,
because
her
incentive
is
now
to
reduce
your
recovery.
this
is
the
exact
opposite
of
the
duty
of
cooperation
that
federal
and
state
law
envisioned
for
this
process.
the
second--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--because
at
this...
if...
if
we're
in
a
post
hoc
hearing
to
sort
of
allocate
the
settlement,
she
wants
to
keep...
have
as
much
of
it
put
into
the
pain
and
suffering
and
lost
wages
pile
and
as
little
in
the
medical
liability
pile
because
she
doesn't
go
home
with
that.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
then
if...
i'm
sorry.
there's
two...
there's
two
different
post
hearings
you
could
have.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
one
would
be
a
fight
with
her.
the
other
one
would
be
they
go
in
to
sue
the
defendants.
now,
at
this
point,
she's
not
necessarily
adverse,
but
she
has
no
interest
to
help.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
she
may
if
there's
an
indemnity
agreement,
which
means
if
they
have
to
pay
to
us,
they
will...
i'm
sorry.
can
i
finish?
that
if...
if
the
defendants
have
to
pay
more
to
us,
then
they
will
get
to
go
after
her.
and
that's
the
concern.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
thank
you.
