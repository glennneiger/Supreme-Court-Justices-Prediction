chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
04-1506,
arkansas
department
of
health
and
human
services
v.
ahlborn.
ms.
freno.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
were
the
petitioner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
were...
you
were
the
petitioner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you're
filing
a
petition,
you
have
to
have
some
expectation
that
you
might
end
up
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
you're...
you're
entitled
to
100
percent
under
arkansas
law,
but...
and
i
take
it,
that
would
be
without
regard
to
what
the
federal
law
required.
the
arkansas
law
can
go
beyond...
just
looking
at
the
assignment
provision,
beyond
what
the
federal
law
requires
you
do
as
a
condition
of
participation
in
medicaid.
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that...
in
other
words,
you're
saying
we
don't
even
have
to
reach
the
anti
lien
provision
question.
if
we
think
the
medicaid
condition
only
goes
to
the
extent
payments
for
medical
care,
then
you
would
lose
without
regard
to
the
anti
lien
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
arkansas
law,
as
you
understand
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--requires
a...
a
full...
full
assignment
of
any
expenses
the
state...
or
full
recovery
of
any
expenses
the
state
has
incurred.
it's
not...
it's
a
debate
whether
medicaid
law
requires
that.
and
what
you're
saying
is
if
we
think
the
medicaid
law
does
not
require
it,
you
would
lose
without
regard
to
any
consideration
of
the
anti
lien
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
one
of
the
issues,
and
i'm
trying
to
understand.
the
respondent's
position
is
that
the
arkansas
law
goes
beyond
what
the
medicaid
assignment
provisions
require.
and
i
want
your
position
on
whether
or
not,
if
that's
right,
again
without
regard
to
the
anti
lien
provision,
that
you
would
lose.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can...
arkansas
can
go
beyond
what
the
medicaid
law
requires
for
reimbursement,
if
it
wants.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
if
we
read
the
medicaid
statute
to
require
something
less
than
what
your
position
is
here,
then
you
lose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
that's
without
regard
to
the
anti
lien
provision,
or
is
it
because
of
the
anti
lien
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
blair.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
federal
statute
provides
you,
you
think,
with
a
defense
to
the
state
law
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why...
why
was
there
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so...
so
your
view
of
jurisdiction
depends
upon
the
federal
defense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that...
and
which
of
our
cases
say
that
a
federal
defense
supports
federal
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
allows
you
to
come
into
court
if
the
claim
that
would
have
been
brought
against
you
would
have
been
brought
in
federal
court,
and
the
claim
that
would
have
been
brought
against
you
would
have
been
under
arkansas
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sounds
like
a
defense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
still
sounds
like
a
defense
to
me,
counsel,
and
i
think
it
may
make
a
difference
if
your
argument
relies
on
the
anti
lien
provision
as
a
defense
or
perhaps
relies
on
the...
the
assignment
provisions
in
the
medicaid
statute.
that's
why
i'm
just
trying
to
focus
on
whether
it's
the
assignment
provisions
that
limit
what
arkansas
can
do
as
a
matter
of
its
own
law,
or
if
it's
the
anti
lien
provision
as
a
defense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
reason
that
the
federal
law
would
have
to
act
as
a
limitation
on
the
state
law?
in
other
words,
if
we
read
the...
the
federal
law
your
way,
is
there
any
reason
it
would
frustrate
the
federal
purposes
for
the
state
to
say,
well,
we
want
to
get
all
of
the
medical
expenses?
we
don't
just
want
to
get
the
proportionate
share
of
the
recovery.
that...
that's
enough
for
the
feds,
but
we
are
also
out
state
money
and
we
want
that
state
money.
they
can
go
further,
can't
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
absence
of
the
anti
lien.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
blair.
ms.
freno,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
freno.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
steven
says
the
opinion
in
04-1506,
arkansas
department
of
health
and
human
services
versus
ahlborn.
