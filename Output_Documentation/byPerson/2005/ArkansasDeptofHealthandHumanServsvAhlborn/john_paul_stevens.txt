justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
arkansas
was
a
party
to
the
case,
it
didn't
get
notice
of
the
dismissal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
you
have
a
claim
for
incompetent
counsel
representing
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
wondering
you...
if
you
have
a
claim
against
counsel
for
being
incompetent
in
letting
a
settlement
be
made
without
notice
to
the...
to
you.
it
seems
to
me
hard
to...
hard
to
understand
how
this
could
happen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
could
she...
after
that
assignment,
could
she
bring
a
suit
in
her
own
right
to
do
that,
to
recover
the
medical
costs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
she's
assigned
the
cause
of
action
to
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
clarifying
question?
if
it's
50/50
because
of
a
jury
verdict
of
comparative
negligence,
then
you
only
get
half
the
money.
if
it's
50/50
because
of
a
settlement,
believing
they
only
have
a
50
percent
chance
of
recovery,
what...
what
is
your
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
the
state
should
sue
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
here
the
state
should
therefore
sue,
if
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here
it's
stipulated
i
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
it's
a
compromise.
just
as
my
other
example
of
a
50/50
chance
of
winning
the
lawsuit,
you
compromise
for
50
percent.
i
don't
see
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
contention
that
the
medical
was
under
valued
in
the
settlement
or...
i
thought
it
was
understood
that
it
was
the
same
proportion
of
the
settlement.
i
mean,
if
you
discounted
everything
by
50
percent,
medical
was
discounted
by
the
same
percentage
as
everything
else.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
there's
some...
i...
i
wasn't
clear
on
whether
the
state
had
stipulated
that
this
is
what
you
agreed
with
the
other
side
or
that
this
is
a
fair
calculation
of
the
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
respect
to
the
text
of
the
statute
and
whether
the
anti
lien
provision
applies,
i'd
be
interested
in
your
view,
as
a
matter
of
arkansas
law,
as
to
who
owned
the
chose
in
action
first
and,
secondly,
who
owned
the
proceeds
of
the
settlement
recovery
after
the
assignment
had
taken
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit.
we
granted
review
to
decide
whether
a
state
can,
consistent
with
federal
medicaid
law,
assert
a
lien
on
a
medicaid
recipient’s
tort
settlement
in
an
amount
exceeding
the
portion
of
the
settlement
that
represents
payments
for
medical
care.
heidi
ahlborn
was
severely
injured
in
a
car
accident
in
1996.
because
she
was
unable
to
pay
all
of
her
medical
costs,
arkansas,
through
its
federally
subsidized
medicaid
program,
paid
roughly
$215,000.00
of
medical
expenses
on
her
behalf.
meanwhile,
ahlborn
sued
the
individuals
allegedly
responsible
for
her
injuries.
arkansas
intervened
in
that
suit
to
assert
a
lien
on
any
settlement,
but
did
not
actually
participate
in
settlement
negotiations
that
ultimately
took
place.
she
received
an
unallocated
settlement
in
the
amount
of
$550,000.00.
although
arkansas
stipulated
that
only
about
$35,000.00
of
that
settlement
represented
payments
for
medical
care,
it
nonetheless
asserts
that
it’s
entitled
to
full
reimbursement
in
the
amount
of
about
$215,000.00
for
all
costs
it
paid
on
ahlborn’s
behalf
under
the
medicaid
system.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
8th
circuit’s
ruling
that
arkansas
is
entitled
only
to
the
portion
of
ahlborn’s
settlement
that
represents
payments
for
medical
care,
that
is,
$35,000.00.
under
the
federal
medicaid
provisions,
a
state
can
--
indeed,
it
must
--
require
a
medicaid
recipient
to
assign
her
rights
to
recovery
from
third
parties
of,
quote,
“payments
for
medical
care,”
unquote;
but
the
federal
statute
neither
requires
nor
authorizes
assignment
of
rights
to
payment
for
other
items
of
damage
and,
in
fact,
the
federal
and
anti-lien
statute
affirmatively
prohibits
arkansas’s
placement
of
a
lien
on
property
of
the
recipient
that
does
not
constitute
third-party
payments
for
medical
care.
such
property
includes
the
part
of
ahlborn’s
settlement
that
represents
nonmedical
damages.
to
the
extent
arkansas
statutorily
inviolates
the
federal
anti-lien
provision,
it
cannot
be
enforced.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
