justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
understand--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
but
that's
not
at
issue.
that
is,
i
think
the
question
is,
why
is
it
that
this
statute
doesn't
simply
provide
the
following
route?
party
a
and
party
b
enter
into
a
settlement,
and
they
say
$10,000
is
for
medical
and
$90,000
is
for
pain
and
suffering.
you,
arkansas,
are
out
$50,000.
well,
fine.
you're
in
the
case
anyway.
sue
the
defendant
for
the
remaining
$40,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
have
no
idea
about
that.
i'm
interested
in
this
nest
of
statutes,
and
the
question
i
think
that
i
would
have
is
why
doesn't
the
statute
propose
the
route
for
a
state
in
your...
in
your
position
that
i
just
said.
if
they
have
a
good
faith
settlement
and
they
think
that
$10,000
of
this
good
faith
settlement
is
attributable
to
the
medical
expense
and
you
are
out
$40,000...
$50,000,
you
can
sue
the
other
party.
and
if
you're
in
the
case,
you
just
proceed
with
the
suit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
can't
settle
your
claim
out
from
under
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
want
to
go
back
to
the
federal
statutes
and
the
state
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
this
discussion
just
suggest
what
the
answer
is
to
the
legal
question
raised?
the
answer
is,
of
course,
you
cannot
get
a
hold
of
this
money
in
the
hands
of
the
victim.
the
money
in
the
hands
of
the
accident
victim
is
not
your
money.
it
is
not
medical
expense
money.
it
was
stipulated
that
it
is
not.
that
doesn't
leave
you
without
a
remedy.
the
remedy
is
to
go
against
the
causer
of
the
accident
and
get
the
extra
money
that
you
think
is
entitled
to
you.
the
statutes
say
that
literally,
and
why
not
just
follow
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
why...
why
then
is
it
unreasonable
for
the
state
to
take
this
position,
the
one
that
the
government
took?
they
said,
of
course,
we,
the
governments
of
state
and
federal
have
only
the
right
to
attach
the
portion
of
that
settlement
that
is
representative
of
the
medical
expenditure.
and
where
we're
in
on
the
deal,
you'll
all
agree
what
that
portion
is,
or
there
won't
be
a
settlement
and
we'll
proceed
to
trial.
but
where
we're
cut
out
of
the
deal...
and
we
shouldn't
be
because
there's
a
duty
to
cooperate...
we
will
assume
in
that
instance
that
it...
every
penny
of
that
medical
expense
is
included
in
the
amount
that
was
settled
for.
and
they
say,
given
the
statutes,
that's
a
reasonable
way
of
enforcing
their
federal
obligation
to
recover
the
money.
now,
whether
we
agree
or
disagree
with
it
as
a
matter
of
policy,
what
is
wrong
with
their
saying
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
choose
to
interpret
the
words
this
way
and
implement
the
statute
that
way
and
we
have
every
right
to
do
it?
why
don't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
all
consistent,
of
course,
with
their
position.
they
say
congress
delegated
to
us
the
authority
to
interpret
the
words
this
way.
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
words.
we
don't
deny
that
you
can
settle
for
what
you
want.
all
we're
saying
is,
where
we're
cut
out,
that
that
pile
of
money
is
deemed
by
us
to
include
every
penny
of
medical
expense,
and
therefore
we
get
it
because
we're
not
taking
money
that
isn't
medical
expense.
we
are
taking
money
that
does
represent
medical
expense
according
to
our
deeming
rules.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what's
legally
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose,
though,
that
were
the
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
given
your
experience...
say,
think
of
the
generality
of
cases
like
this
one...
would
it
be
difficult
for
you,
representing
the
victims,
if
the
rule
were
that
these
statutes
give
the
government
the
authority
that
they
want
here,
as
i
understand
it...
the
federal
government...
which
is
to
say
you
have
an
obligation
to
notify
the
state
of
the
presence
of
settlement
negotiations.
now,
once
you've
done
that,
you've
given
them
an
opportunity
to
participate.
if
they
have
that
opportunity,
thereafter
they
cannot
attach
more
than
what
are
the
real
medical
expenses,
which
could
be
a
matter
for
argument
in
a
settlement
like
this.
but
if
you
don't
give
them
that
opportunity,
they
have
the
right
to
presume
that
that
settlement,
which
they
knew
nothing
about,
contains
the
full
amount.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
what
are
the
practicalities
of
that?
why
would
it
hurt
the
lawyers
representing
victims?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
just
require
a
letter,
certified.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
it's...
it's
relevant.
and
i'm
trying
to
think
through
the
practicalities
of
it,
which
you're
more
familiar
with.
suppose
that
you
win
this.
if
you
win
this,
then
the
defendant's
insurance
companies
know
that
they're
subject
to
further
liability
for
the
medicals
in
every
case.
and
why
won't
they
sit
there
and
tell
you
at
this
settlement,
hey,
we're
not
going
to
enter
into
this
unless
you
get
the
state
involved
so
they
sign
off
on
it
too?
we're
not
going
to
just
compromise
some
of
our
liability.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it
sounds
as
if
we're
going
to
get
to
the
same
place,
that
if...
if
you
prevail,
probably
the
insurance
companies
will
want
the
state
to
be
involved
or
they
haven't
limited
their
liability,
and
if
you
lose,
then
we
would
have
said
that
you
have
to
get
the...
the
state
involved.
