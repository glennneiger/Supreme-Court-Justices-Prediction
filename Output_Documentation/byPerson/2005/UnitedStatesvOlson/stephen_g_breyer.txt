justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
that
might
have...
you
might
have
won
if
they
had
said,
"we're
going
to
look
to
see
what
the
law
is
in
arizona
governing
a
private
person
who
performs
a
similar
kind
of
inspection.
"
"and
we
decide
that
it's
the
same.
"
you
would
have
won
that,
i
guess.
but
you
didn't,
because
they
didn't.
that
isn't
what
they
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is,
we're
not
looking
to
the
law
governing
private
persons,
we
are
just
looking
at
law
governing
municipalities,
and
they're...
it
seems
to
me
they
are
pretty
clearly
wrong
about
that,
unless
you
give
me
a
reason
why
they're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
good
question.
suppose
you
really
had
a
person
who...
there's
just
no
comparable
private
person
in
like
circumstances.
i
can't
even
imagine
what
that
could
be.
maybe
you
could
imagine.
but
i
was
trying
to
think
of
some
secret
research
on
turning
people
invisible
or
something
for
military
purposes.
i
mean,
i...
it's
just
hard...
i
mean,
hard
here,
obviously.
there
is
such
a
person.
there
are
private
mine
inspectors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
there
are
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah,
but
louie,
according
to
the
sg,
says,
"we
say
here
that
this
person
is
not
liable...
the
government
is
not
liable,
because,
in
washington,
washington
would
not
make
a
municipality
liable.
"
while
adding
that
the
law
of
washington
is
that
a
municipality
is
liable
only
if
a
private
person
in
washington
is
liable.
so,
i
wouldn't
think
louie
is
very
good
authority
that
the
ninth
circuit
thought
it
was
for
the
proposition
that
you
look
not
to
the
private
person,
but
you
look
to
only
the
municipality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--reading
from
their
brief.
what
they
say
is,
the
court
stressed
that
the
equivalence
is
important.
the
equivalence
of
what?
under
washington
law,
state
and
municipal
government
entities
are
liable
only
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
person.
and
they
cite
page
825.
and
they
stress
this
equivalence,
because
a
finding
of
immunity
for
state
employees
under
state
law
does
not
determine
the
scope
of
the
u.s.
liabilities.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
anyway,
if
louie
helps
something
other
than
that,
it's
wrong,
too,
isn't
it?
because
what
the
statute
says
is,
it's
a
question
of
looking
to
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--private
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
actually
a
rather
interesting
question
i
don't
really
know
the
answer
to.
the
idea
is
that
you
can't
find
an
analogous
private
person.
we
might
have
to
write
something
about
that.
you
could
say...
you...
there
always
is
an
analogous
private
person.
it's
impossible
to
think
of
an
example.
the
other
extreme,
you
have
the
ninth
circuit,
which
could...
which
says
as
long
as
the
government
was
involved
in
regulation,
there
is
no
analogous
private
person,
because
private
people
don't
regulate.
i
would
think
that
was
almost
certainly
wrong.
but
what
is
the
right
way
to
go
about
it?
are
there
such
people,
or
aren't
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
that's
exactly
what's
concerning
me,
and
i
don't
quite
see
my
way
to
an
answer.
suppose
we
do
send
it
back
because
we
think
just
what
you
said
wasn't
so
is
so,
they
have
to
now
into
this.
they'll
have
to
go
into
it.
should
we
suggest,
"look,
you
try
harder
to
find
a
private
analogy,
because
there's
almost
always
a
private
analogy.
"
every
government
official
has
some
similarities
to
private
people,
and
some
differences.
so,
we
could
emphasize
that,
or
we
could
suggest,
"no,
actually,
there
are
quite
a
few
differences.
"
i
don't
have
much
of
a
feeling
for
which
way
to
go
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that's
not...
that's
not
what
i've
been
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
to
expose
everything
i
was...
perhaps
the
better
thing
is
to
say,
"there's
always
a
private
analogy",
or
try
very
hard,
because
if
you
really
found
an
instance
there
was
no
private
analogy
to,
maybe
there
would
be
no
recovery,
because
the
statute
simply
speaks
about
private
party.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
this
is
a
statute
designed
to
give
people
recovery--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--when
people
commit
torts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
it
does,
but
that...
would
we
end
up
there,
because
of
the
way
the
statute's
written?
you
avoid
the
whole
matter
if
you
say,
"look
for
the
closest
private
person,
no
matter
what.
"
and
maybe
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
subject
of
this
case
is
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
it’s
an
act
that,
by
waiving
sovereign
immunity,
permits
an
injured
person
to
bring
tort
suits
against
the
united
states.
it
says
that
those
tort
suits
can
be
brought,
“under
circumstances
where
the
united
states,
if
a
private
person,
would
be
liable
under
state
law”.
okay?
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
arizona
mineworkers,
who
say
that
the
negligence
of
federal
mine
inspectors
helped
bring
about
the
mine
accident
that
seriously
injured
them.
we
are
now
reviewing
a
decision
of
the
9th
circuit
on
this
matter,
which
held
two
things:
first,
it
said
mine
inspection
is
a,
“unique
governmental
function”,
a
function
for
which
there
is
no
private-person
analogy;
second,
it
said
that
the
mineworkers’
lawsuit
can
go
forward
against
the
united
states
anyway,
because,
it
said,
under
similar
circumstances
a,
“state
or
municipal
entity”
would
be
liable
under
arizona
state
law.
in
our
view,
the
9th
circuit’s
two
holdings
both
depart
from
well-established
law.
first,
the
act
says
the
united
states
can
be
held
liable
if
a
private
person
would,
in
similar
circumstances,
be
liable
under
state
law;
it
doesn’t
say
if
a
state
or
municipal
entity,
under
similar
circumstances,
would
be
held
liable
under
state
law.
and
in
1955,
a
case
in
this
court
called
indian
towing
company,
the
court
said
the
words
mean
what
they
say:
it’s
tort
law
governing
private
people,
not
tort
law
governing
state
or
municipal
entities
that
has
to
determine
liability
under
the
act,
and
we
found
no
authority
to
the
contrary,
either
in
this
court
or
any
other
lower
court
outside
the
9th
circuit.
the
second,
the
9th
circuit
held
there
are
no
private-person
analogies
to
the
federal
mine
inspection;
but
indian
towing
said
the
opposite.
that
case
involved
a
claim
that
the
coast
guard
was
negligent
in
failing
to
inspect
a
lighthouse.
the
court
said
that
there
is
a
private
person
to
a
lighthouse.
the
private
person
is
the
person
who
undertakes
a
good-samaritan
obligation.
so
if
there
are
private-person
analogies
for
lighthouses,
we
think
there
must
be
private-person
analogies
for
mine
inspections,
private
inspections.
indeed,
the
government
concedes
as
much,
and
lower
courts
outside
the
9th
circuit
all
have
consistently
found
private-person
analogies
in
similar
circumstances.
we
consequently
vacate
the
9th
circuit
decision,
and
we
remand
the
case
for
further
consideration.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
