i
really
don't
understand
the...
are
you
sure
that
a
failure
to
execute
a
statute
does
not
come
within
the
language,
"an
act
or
omission",
in
the
execution
of
the
statute?
i
would
think
a
total
failure
to
execute
is
an
omission
in
the
execution
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
if
you
executed
90
percent
and
omit
10
percent
of
what
you're
supposed
to
do,
it
comes
within
that
language,
but
if
you
don't
execute
at
all,
it
doesn't?
that
seems
to
me
most
unlikely.
i
mean
it
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
accepted,
it
seemed
to
me,
the
premise
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--justice
souter's
question,
which
is
that
(a)...
2680(a)
only
applies
to
a
failed
execution.
there
has
to
be
at
least
an
attempted
execution.
i'm
not
sure
that's
true.
it
says
"an
act
or
omission"
in
the
execution.
and
i
think
a
total...
i
just
don't
do
the
thing
at
all.
i
think
that's
an
omission
in
the
execution.
justice
antonin
scalia
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
wouldn't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
goes
to
the
remand
question
raised--
justice
antonin
scalia
--earlier.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
go
to
whether
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cotter,
i
don't...
i
don't
see,
in
the
opinion,
any
indication
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
doing
what
you...
what
you
assert
it
was
trying
to
do...
namely,
to
predict
what
future
california
law...
locked
deep
in
the
bosom
of
the
california
supreme
court,
but
not
yet
disclosed
to
the
public...
will
hold.
it
didn't
proceed
that
way
at
all.
it
says,
generally,
the
united
states
can
be
held
liable
only
when
liability
was
attached
to
a
private
actor,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
however,
the
united
states
may
be
liable,
quoting
from
one
of
the
ninth
circuit's
earlier
cases,
for
the
performance
of
some
activities
that
private
persons
do
not
perform
when
a
state
or
municipal
entity
would
be
held
liable
under
the
law
where
the
activity
occurred.
i
don't
see
they
are
saying,
"we
are
trying
to
predict
what
california
would
do
in
a
private
situation.
"
they
have
set
forth
a
rule
that,
where
there's
no
cause
of
action
against
a
private
person,
we
look
to
whether
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
under...
against
a
state
or
subdivision
of
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
long
ago
was
that...
was
louie
decided?
justice
antonin
scalia
twenty
years
ago.
and
washington
still
has
not
yet
made
this
prediction
come
true,
i
gather.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
not
extended
its
government
tort
claims
act
to
private
citizens.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
saying
the
prediction
that
louie
made
had
not
yet
come
true.
there
is
still
no
washington
decision
that
has
done
what
louie
said
it
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
be
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
didn't
try
to
do
that.
it
made
no
effort
to
do
that.
it
just
said...
it
just
said
the
united
states
may
be
liable
when
a
state
or
municipal
entity
would
be
held
liable.
it
made
no
effort
to
figure
out
what
washington
would
do
with
a
private
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
was
your
response
to
the
motion
to
dismiss?
the
government
said
that
you
didn't
raise,
in
response
to
the
motion
to
dismiss,
any
assertion
that
private
individuals
would
be
liable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
state
law
in
this...
in
this
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i...
that's
how
i
understood
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
your
response?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
that?
you
said
that,
"and
we
have
a...
we
have
asserted
all
the
elements
of
good
samaritan?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
saying
that
there
is
no
private
party
analog
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
as
saying
you
lose
under
what
we
consider
to
be
the
proper
private
party
analog...
namely,
good
samaritan.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
the
court
of
appeals
hasn't
done.
