mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
last
point
made
by
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general,
which
is
the
daggett
case.
and
i
address
that
merely
to
highlight
that
this
is
a
state
law.
it...
the
daggett
case
did
not
hold,
as
the
solicitor
general
maintains,
that
under
arizona
law
there
would
be
no
duty
under
the
restatement
sections
323
or
324.
in
fact,
what
the
court
says
in
remanding
the
case
because
they
found
a
duty
under
the
county
regulations,
is,
"we
assume,
without
deciding,
that
there
is
a
claim
under
324
and...
323
and
324,
and
note
simply
that
there
are
no
allegations
in
the
plaintiff's
complaint
that
would
satisfy
those
issues.
"
so,
they
simply
say,
because
there's
additional
litigation
coming,
they
were
giving
heads
up
to
the
party
that
he
needs
to
amend
the
complain
to
assert
the
good
samaritan
elements.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
your
honor,
mr.
olson
did
collect,
under
the
state
workers'
compensation
statute,
from
the
mine
operator,
that
is
correct,
as
did
mr.
vargas.
and,
in
fact,
the
state
of
arizona
was
sued...
the
state
mine
inspector...
alleging
that
they
were
negligent,
and
that
case
was
resolved.
that...
a
point
of
interest
in
that
case
is
that
in
that
case,
the
state...
because
arizona
is
a
pure
comparative
negligence
state...
alleged
that
the
federal
mine
inspector
was
partially
at
fault
and
that,
therefore,
mr.
olson
and
mr.
vargas'
damages
should
be
reduced,
just
as,
in
our
case,
if
we
had
proceeded
beyond
the
motion
to
dismiss
phase,
we
could
have
anticipated,
as
is
common,
that
the
federal
government
would
have
identified
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
mine
operator
to
be
non
parties
at
fault,
as
well,
so
that
those
individuals...
the
negligence
of
those
individuals
would
reduce
the
plaintiff's
damages
against
the
federal
government.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
that
is
correct.
in
the
interest
of
candor,
i
have
to
tell
your
honor
that
we
sued
the
parent
company
to
the
mine
operator,
which
is
grupo
mexico,
in
an
attempt
to
assert
a
claim,
and
that
case
was
resolved
only
by
some...
by
making
some
concessions
on
the
workers'
compensation
lien
issues
that
the
workers'
compensation
carrier
had
back
against
the
claimants
for
their
recovery
from
the
state
of
arizona.
i
hope
that's
clear.
but,
generally,
workers'
compensation
carriers
have
a
right
to
get
repaid
if
there's
some
private
settlement,
and
concessions
were
made
on
this
right,
because
of
the...
suing
the
parent
company,
and
that
case
was
never
resolved
on
the
merits.
to
begin,
your
honor,
this
came
to
the
ninth
circuit
from
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
that
has
significance
to
this...
to
this
question,
because
the
plaintiffs
were
not
able
to
develop
the
factual
record
which
goes
to
the
issues
of
whether
or
not
there
would
be
liability
under
the
state
law...
the
good
samaritan
law
or
under...
issues
about
assumption
of
duty
under
state
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
it--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--it
does--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--well,
in
a
roundabout
way,
it
does,
justice
scalia,
because
what
happened
was,
the
ninth
circuit
was
faced
with
the
task,
under
the
federal
tort
claim
act,
of
deciding
whether...
if
the
federal
government...
the
federal
mine
inspectors,
if
you
would...
were
private
people
under
like
circumstances,
would
they
be
liable?
so,
the
ninth
circuit
was
essentially
asked
a
hypothetical
question
by
the
federal
tort
claim,
and
it
was
asked
to
resolve
that
question
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
which
the
standard
is,
of
course,
that
we
can
set...
we
can
prove
no
facts
which
would...
which
would
establish
a
cause
of
action.
and
what
the
court
really
did,
because
the
court
applied
a
body
of
law...
the
ninth
circuit...
that
began
with
the
louie
doctrine...
is,
the
court
looked
at
arizona
mine
inspector
law
as
a
predictor
to
what
arizona
private
person
law
would
be.
and
from
justice
roberts'
questions
about
police
officers,
in
the
louie
case,
the
state
of
washington,
like
the
state
of
arizona,
had
waived
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--well,
your
honor,
what...
our
position
is
that,
although
they
applied
the
law
of
municipalities
and
the
state,
what
they
were
really
doing
is
applying
the
louie
doctrine,
which
says
that
when
you
cannot
identify
a
private
actor,
then
the
best
evidence
of
what
the
state's
law
is,
with
respect
to
the
actions
of
a
party
in
the
same
circumstances,
is
to
look
at
the
state
liability,
and
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--well,
actually,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
private
mine
inspectors,
but
if
we
want
to
take
that
thought--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--if
the
private
mine
inspector
had
the...
assumed
the
same
duties,
so
it's
under
like
circumstances,
that
the
federal
mine
inspector
had
here,
which
was
to
inspect
the
mine
in
its
entirety
four
times
per
year
and
to
respond
to
all
safety
related
complaints
and
determine
whether
they
present
imminent
hazards,
and
to
remove
the
miners
from
the
area...
if
those
are
the
characteristics
of
the
private
individual
under
like
circumstances,
then
i
concede
that
would
be
a
better
predictor
of
state...
and
if
we
knew
what
arizona
would
decide
in
that
context,
i--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--justice
scalia,
i
concede
that
the
court
has
accurately
characterized
the
opinion.
if
i
remember
the
cases
cited
by
the
opinion,
they're
concrete
tie
and
hines,
which
lead
directly
back
to
the
louie
opinion,
which
was
the
decided
at
the
behest
of
the
government,
because,
in
louie,
there
was
a
law
enforcement
operator
who...
a
law
enforcement
official
who
failed
to
stop
a
drunk
driver,
and
they
said,
"there
is"...
the
government
said,
"there
is
no
private
person
here.
"
and,
therefore,
if
you
look
to
washington
state
law,
which
does
not
impose
liability
in
these
circumstances,
you
get
a
good
idea
of
what
washington
law
would
rule
if
there
were
a
private
person.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
about
20
years
ago.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
you
mean
it
has
not
ruled
on--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--the
subject?
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
i
think...
i
think
that
the
federal
tort
claim
act
does
not
apply
to
private
citizens
in
washington.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
would
not
do.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
louie
predicted
that
there
would
be
no
liability.
and,
in
fact,
i
think
that
that
remains
the
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
if
i
understand
your
honor's--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--point--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--and,
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
equivalence
factor
in
louie
is
present
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
we--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--the
respondents
concede
that
the
question
is
"private
person
under
like
circumstances".
we
concede
that
point.
our
point
is
simply
that,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
ninth
circuit
was
faced
with
trying
to
decide
what
would
arizona
law
be
with
a
private
person
under
like
circumstances?
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
well,
justice
roberts,
our
contention
is
that
the
genesis
of
the
doctrine
that
they
applied,
and
that
the
fifth
circuit
applies,
and
that
the
d.c.
circuit
applies,
is
to
predict
state
law,
that
its
purpose
is
not
to
expand
liability
where
state
law
doesn't
exist.
in
fact,
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
it
acknowledges
that
private
person
is
the
test.
but
then
it
says
that
when
we
cannot
find
a
private
person,
this
is
what
we
do.
we
go
look
to
the
state
law.
and
the
crider
case
says,
basically,
that
when
you
do
that...
from
the
fifth
circuit...
what
you're
doing
is
looking
at
the
legal
principles
that
are...
you're
looking
at
a
factual
situation
that
best
articulates
the
state
law
legal
principles--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--well,
that
issue
was
actually
raised
in
the
hatchel
case,
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
where
the...
there
was
a
highspeed
chase
and
the
officer
caused
a
collision,
and
what
happened
was,
the
government
argued
that
you
can't
apply
the
standard
applicable
defined
duty
of
the
government,
but
you
can
apply
the
government...
or
the
d.c.
regulations
as
to
standard
of
care.
and
the
d.c.
circuit
found,
no,
it
would
follow
louie
and
crider,
and
say
that
the
best
predictor
of
the
state
law,
when
you
can't
find
an
analogous
private
person,
is
the
liability
statutes
that
concern
the
law
enforcement,
but,
following
indian
towing,
it
would
not
apply
the
gross
negligence
standard
that
the
d.c.
circuithad
adopted
that
concerned
the
officers.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
well,
your
honor,
what
i
would
say
in
this
case
is,
the
absolute
wrong
way
to
go
about
it
is
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
because,
unfortunately,
the
record
wasn't
developed,
which
may,
in
fact,
speak
to
issues
that
may,
in
fact,
address
arizona
law
on
good
samaritan,
for
instance...
the
issue
of
whether,
under
arizona
law,
a
duty
was
assumed,
the
issue
of
whether
reliance
exists.
and
i
have
to
correct
the
solicitor
general.
the
reliance
does
not
merely
come
from
the
injured
party.
the
restatement
section,
section
three...
or
the
restatement
section
324
says
reliance
is
from
the
other
for
the
injured
party.
so,
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--well,
if
i
may
answer
with
a
hypothetical,
your
honor,
because
we
did
not
get
to
develop
the
record,
what
happened
in
this
case
is,
the
mine
method
changed.
they
went
from
taking
the
floor
to
the
taking
the
back.
and
they
ripped
out
the
ground
support.
so,
people
were
working
under
unsupported
ground.
we,
because
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss,
never
got
the
opportunity
to
take
the
mine
operator
and
said,
"why
on
earth"...
the
deposition
of
the
mine
operator...
"did
you
think
you
could
do
this?
"
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
"why
on
earth
did"--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--oh--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--justice
scalia,
i
did
not
understand
the
government
to
be
saying
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--and
it
is
not
true,
if
that
was--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--what
they
said.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
our
response
was
that
the
law...
first,
our
response
was
that,
under
the
motion
to
dismiss,
our
factual
allegations
in
the
complaint
have
to
be
accepted,
and
we
alleged
all
the
elements
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine,
and
all
the
elements
of
the
uniquely
governmental--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
and
what
happened
was,
frankly,
judge
browning
dismissed,
relying,
i
think,
on
the...
more
on
the
discretionary
function
exception,
and
then
the
myers
case,
out
of
the
sixth
circuit,
saying,
as
a
matter
of
law,
this...
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
msha
is
not
an
assumption
of
duty
by
the
government.
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
court
is
inclined
to
address
that
issue
or
not,
but
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
on
that
issue,
the
federal
tort
claim
act
makes
the
issue
of
whether
the
government's
liable
a
question
of
state
law.
the
question
is,
as
we
have
conceded,
whether
the
mine
inspector
would
be
liable
if
he
were
a
private
person,
and...
which
i
think
goes
to
the
prior
question
about,
"what
if
there
is
no"--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
court
is--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--if
the
court--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--if
the
court
is
convinced
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
not
try
to
predict
what
private
law
would...
that...
what
private
law
in
arizona
would
be,
if
the
federal
mine
inspector
was
a
private
citizen,
then
we
would
concede
that
that's
not
the
law.
but
we
believe
that
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
following
those
cases...
the
louie
case,
the
crider
case,
and
all
of
the
cases
that
were--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--your
honor,
if
you
do
decide
to
remand...
which
if
the
issue
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
or
assumption
of
duty
under
arizona
law
is
going
to
be
addressed,
we
recommend
that
there
is
a
remand...
we
would
urge
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
first...
the
first
rule
is
to
instruct
the
ninth
circuit
that
these
are
badly...
these
are
cases
that
are
badly
decided
on
motions
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
because
the
arizona
law
on
when
someone
cites
a...
adopts
a
duty...
the
daggett
case
or
the
papastathis
case...
are
all
fact
intensive.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
and--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--with
all
due
respect,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--sure.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
it's
a...
it's
a
statute
where...
with
a
broad
waiver
intended.
but
i
actually
think
if
the...
if
the
rule
were
"if
there's
no
private
analogy,
there's
no
recovery.
"
it
sort
of
reverses
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
i
concede
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
my
best
analogy
here
is
a
private
mine
inspector
who
has
the
same
duties
as
a
federal
mine
inspector,
which,
in
this
case,
who...
you
could
say
someone
who
contracted--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--well,
earlier,
the
suggestion
was
made,
"what
happens
if
the
government"...
i
thought
the
suggestion
was,
"what
if
the
government
outsources
mine
inspections?
"
"what
if,
instead
of--
"
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--the
arizona
state
mine
inspector.
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--well,
my
second
best
analog,
i
guess,
would
be
a
workers'
comp
carrier,
an
insurer,
or--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--i
believe
we
can
rely--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--i--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary,
if
the
court
doesn't
want
to
address
whether
the
government
always
needs
to...
or
the
courts
always
need
to
find
a
private
person.
the
good--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--sure.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
well,
in
the
restatement,
section
324,
under
"assumption
of
a
duty",
gives
an
example.
and
the
example
is,
if
a
private
company
hires
a
scaffolding
inspector,
and
the
scaffolding
inspector
does
a
negligent
inspection,
and
a
worker
falls
and
is
injured,
the
worker
has
a
claim
against
the
scaffolding
inspector.
and
then,
under
the
reliance
component
is--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--i
believe--
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
--i
think
that
that's
true,
your
honor,
although
i'd
like
to
read
a
quote
from
papastathis,
which
is...
the
court
relied
on.
the
quote
is
just
this,
"numerous
cases
have
held
that
once
a
party
gratuitously
agrees
to
inspect
and
the
third
party
is
subsequently
injured,
that
party
can
be
held
liable
for
its
negligent
inspection.
"
there
is
a
host
of
arizona
case
law
on
assumed
duties.
and
the
case
i
would
refer
to
is
martinez
versus
state,
which
is
simply
a
case
where
a
road
washes
out,
and
the
government
reroutes
the
road
for
a...
for
a
period
of
time
across
a
private
land,
and,
for
a
period
of
time,
grades
it,
and
then
stops
grading
it.
and,
in
that
circumstance,
the
government
was
held
liable
simply
for
having,
for
that
period
of
the
time,
assumed
a
duty.
and
there
wasn't
an
analysis
in
the
martinez
case
of
whether
or
not
the
elements
of
section
324(a)
were
met
or
not.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
or
whether
there
are
alternative
theories
of
liability
available
under
arizona
state
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
yes.
and
the
ninth
circuit
simply
didn't
reach
that
issue.
mr.
thomas
g.
cotter
it
went
off
primarily
under
discretionary
function,
but
then
in
addressing
the
arizona...
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
under
arizona,
it
relied
on
the
myers
case,
which
is
a
case
in
which...
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
when
you
have
the
case...
or
safety
inspections
like
the
federal...
like
msha,
that
court
would
adopt
a
actor,
slash,
monitor
dichotomy
so
that
there
could
never
be
an
assumption
of
duty
under...
because
the
government
was
only
in
a
monitor
function.
and,
to
the
extent
that
that's
at
issue,
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
question,
under
state
law,
of
whether
the
government
had
assumed
the
duty.
and
if
not
under
state
law,
it
would
be
a
question
under
the
federal
tort
claim
of
whether
an...
there
is
an
exception
that
has
been
met.
and
there
is
no
exception.
i
think
that
this
court,
in
berkovitz,
said
that
regulatory
conduct
can
be
actionable
under
the
federal
tort
claim
if
it...
the
discretion
isn't
met...
or
the
discretionary
exception
isn't
met.
and
in
this
case
there
was
an
absolute
obligation
to
make
these
inspections
and
an
absolute
failure
to
do
so.
your
honor,
if
there
are...
or
the
court...
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to--
