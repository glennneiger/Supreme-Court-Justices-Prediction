justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say
that
it
may
be
relevant,
are
you
thinking
of
2680(a)?
because
2680(a)
says,
you
know,
if
you
exercise
due
care,
any
act
that
you
take
in
the...
in...
well,
let's
use
the
exact
language...
"any
act
or
omission
in
the
execution
of
a
statute
or
regulation
will
not
be
a
ground
of
liability.
"
with...
at
least
leaving
open
the
door
that
any
failure
to
take
steps
that
would
have
been
reasonable
in
executing
it
might
be.
is
that
why
you
answered
justice
stevens
as
you
did?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
let
me--
justice
david
h.
souter
--ask
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--look,
i
don't
have
to
cross
reference--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
to
justice
stevens.
justice
david
h.
souter
give
me
an
example
of
the...
of
the
function
of
2680(a).
when
would
there
be
liability,
but
for
that
provision?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
could...
i
could--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
could
understand
that
if
they...
it
would
be
an
easier
question
for
me
if
the
statute
said,
"even
if
you
violate
the
statute,
if
you
otherwise
use
reasonable
care,
no
liability.
"
but
here,
it
talks
about
reasonable
care
when
you
are...
when
you
are,
in
the
statutory
phrase,
in
the
execution
of
the
statute,
which
suggests
to
me
you're
not
violating
the
statute,
you're
not
violating
any
standard.
so,
what
function
does
it
serve?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
it's
really--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
validity
is
the...
is
the
nub
of
the
provision.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
the
federal...
i...
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
she's
saying
"execution"
is
not
synonymous
with
"performance",
which
may
well
be
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
had
assumed
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you've--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you've
still
answered
my
question.
i
mean,
you're...
you
have
said,
"assuming
that
the
individual
is
executing
the
statute,
there
is
no
deficiency
in
the
performance
of
executing
the
statute.
"
"there
is
still
this
function.
"
and
i
think
i
understand
your
answer.
but,
i
mean,
i
think
justice
scalia's
point
is
correct,
it
may
apply
in
cases
in
which
you
are
purporting
to
act
under
the
statute,
but
you
omit
actions
that
you
should
take.
in
other
words,
your
performance
is
deficient.
and
there,
the
answer
is
easier,
because
it
says
as
long
as
you're
exercising
due
care,
no
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
does.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
who's
your...
what's
your
best
analog?
justice
david
h.
souter
whom
does
he
work
for?
do
mines
hire
these
people,
or
does
he
work
for
the
liability
carrier,
which
i
would
have
expected?
i
mean,
if
we're
going
to
make
the
kind
of
suggestion
that
justice
breyer
says
maybe
we
ought
to
make,
we
ought
to
have
something
in
mind.
and
is
it...
is
it
the...
is
it
an
inspector
who
works
for
the
liability
carrier
who
would
be
the
closest
analog
in
your
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
this...
that's
all
hypothetical.
you're
litigating
this
case.
you
must
have
something
in
mind.
whom
do
you
have
in
mind
as
your
best
analog?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
your
second
best
analog?
[laughter]
