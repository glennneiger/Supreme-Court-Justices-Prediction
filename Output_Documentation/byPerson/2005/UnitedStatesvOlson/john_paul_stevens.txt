justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
what
would
you
do
if
arizona
had
a
statute
that
said
that
any
company
that
contracts
privately
to
do
mine
inspections
must
obey
the
standards
in
the
federal
guidelines?
what
would
the
standard
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
i
think
you're
probably
right--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
you
can't
just
make
a
federal...
implied
federal
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
standards,
from
what
we
know.
but
then
i
was
wondering,
what
if
the
arizona
statute
said
that's
what
the
private
firm
should
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
assuming
they
just
did
it
independently.
they
said,
"we
want
a
regulation
on
the
private
mine
inspectors,
and
let's
just
adopt
the...
a
standard
that
shall,
in
all
respects,
be
the
same
as
the
federal
standard.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view...
even
though
the
federal
standard
would
not
be
controlling,
in
your
view,
if
you
applied
a
general
reasonable
person
test,
would
the
federal
standards
be
admissible
so
that
the
plaintiff
could
argue
that
there
was
a
failure
here
which
is
evidence
of
negligence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
maynard,
may
i
interrupt
and
just
ask
this?
do
we
have
to
decide
what
the
arizona
rule
is
in
order
to
decide
the
main
question
presented...
namely,
whether
the
analogy
to
arizona
public
officials
is
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
you're
not
discussing
a
state
law
issue
that
has
not
been
decided
by
either
court
below
or
really
fully
argued
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
