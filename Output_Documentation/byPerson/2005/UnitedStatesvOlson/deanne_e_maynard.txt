ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
federal
tort
claims
act
waived
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
for
the
torts
of
federal
employees
when
private
persons
in
like
circumstances
would
be
liable.
but
instead
of
applying
private
person
principles
of
liability,
the
ninth
circuit
looked
to
the
state
and
governmental
entity
principles
of
liability.
it
concluded
that
the
united
states
could
be
liable
here,
because
arizona
has
decided
to
hold
its
governmental
entities
liable
when
state
employees
are
negligent.
that
decision
is
wrong,
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
is
contrary
to
the
plain
text
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
federal
tort
claims
act
makes
clear
that
the
liability
of
the
united
states
is
to
be
judged
by
the
principles
of
private
person
liability
in
the
place
where
the
tort
occurred.
in
section
1346(b)(1),
the
federal
tort
claims
act
allows
jurisdiction
and
waives
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
under
circumstances
where
the
united
states,
if
a
private
person,
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
as
long
as
arizona
applied
that
principle
of
liability
to
private
persons
in
arizona.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
justice
kennedy.
so,
it
will
depend
on
what
the
particular
state's
law
is.
here,
the
only
private
person
law
that
was
argued
below
was
the
good
samaritan
doctrine,
and...
as
a
possible
analogy
to
the
conduct
of
the
mine
inspectors
here.
but
it
might--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
those
cases,
as
we
know,
do
present,
often,
special
circumstances
not
present
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy.
but
the
answer
to
the
question
that's
presented
here
is
the
same.
you
still
would
look
to
whether
or
not
there
is
private...
a
private
person
analog.
and,
if
there
is,
then
you
would
look
to
the
liability
of
private
persons
in
that
circumstance.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
you
do.
for
example,
if
someone
brought
a
trespass
action
against
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer
for
entering
upon
their
land,
you
would
apply
the
same
state
law
as
it
relates
to
trespass
claims
against
private
persons.
those
claims
may,
for
example,
have
a
defense
of
lawful
authority
to
enter.
when
looking
at
whether
or
not
a
police
officer
had...
a
federal
officer
had
lawful
authority
to
enter,
one
might
then
look
to
federal
law
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
officer
had
authority
to
enter,
but
you
would
still
be
applying
the
principles
of
private
person
liability.
if
one
concluded
that
there
was
no
private
person
analog,
then
the
only
answer
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
would
be
that
the
united
states
cannot
be
liable.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
think
it's
often
rare
that
there
is
no
private
person
analog,
given
this
court's
decision
in
indian
towing,
which
stresses--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
one
should
look
to
a
private
person
in
like
circumstances.
i
think
this
court,
in
feres,
although
that
decision
has
been...
has
been
limited...
did
determine
that
there
was,
in
that
situation,
no
private
party
analog--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--to
the
extent
you're
suggesting
that
we
just
look
to
general
theories
of
tort
law,
i
think
that
would
be
incorrect.
the...
because
the
tort
claims
act...
the
language
of
the
tort
claims
act
makes
the
united
states
liable
only
where
a
private
party
in
like
circumstances
would
be
liable.
and
in
indian
towing,
this
court
defines
"in
like
circumstances"
as
looking
to
the
same
character
of
conduct
of
the...
of
the
person.
so,
you
would
have
to
find
a
private
person
who's
engaged
in
the
same
character
of
conduct,
and
then
ask
the
question,
what
principles
of
liability
does
the
state
apply
to
those
persons?
here,
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
may
be
the
closest
private
person
analog.
in
that
situation,
however,
when
one
goes
to
apply
the
defense,
it's
just
as
one
would
if
talking
about
a
private
security
guard.
one
would
ask
the
questions
whether
the
guard
had
the
requisite
authority.
and
the
state
would
look
to
what
that
guard's
authority
was.
and
often
states
would
look...
if
the
guard
happened
to
be
a
federal
officer,
would
look
to
federal
law.
and
that
can
be
appropriate,
i
think,
for...
under,
potentially,
three
different...
for,
potentially,
three
different
reasons.
one,
the
language
of
the
defense
in
2680(a),
which
provides
the
united
states
with
a
defense
to
liability
in
circumstances
where...
with
you...
you're
carrying
out
a
federal
statute
or
regulation.
it...
another
source
of
authority
might
be
the
state
law
principles
simply
look
to
what
the
authority
of
the
person
doing
the
conduct
is,
and
then
you
would
look
to
federal
law
for
the
source
of
that
authority.
and
that
could
be
right,
under
this
court's
suggestion
in
muniz,
that
federal
regulations...
once
an
actionable
duty
is
established
under
state
tort
principles,
one
can
look
to
federal
regulations
to
determine
whether
or
not...
what
the
applicable
standard
of--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--care
was.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
think
this
court
suggested,
in
muniz,
that
perhaps
there
could
be
private
persons
operating
prisons,
or
one
would
look--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--in
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--you
may
be
right,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
the
important
point
to
take
away
from
muniz
is
that
the
court
stressed
that,
whatever
the
measure
of
the
united
states'
liability
would
be
for
the
claims
at
issue
in
that
case,
it
could
not
be
the
state
law
as
it
related
to
governmental
entities;
that
one
would
have
to,
as
the
text
requires,
look
to
state
law
as
it
relates
to
private
persons.
the
point
that
i--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--for
purposes
of
obtaining
immunity,
we
were
arguing
that...
which
i
think
is
a
different
argument
than
we're
making
here
today...
we
were
arguing
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
not
meant
to
waive
our
sovereign
immunity
at
all
with
respect
to
certain
types
of
governmental
activities.
but
that's
not
the
argument
that
we're
making
today.
today,
we
are
arguing
simply
that
one
must,
as
the
court
held
in
indian
towing
and
rayonier,
one
should
look
to
the...
to
the...
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
that
that
must
be
the
measure
of
our
liability.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
presents
a
difficult
question,
justice
stevens,
as
i'm
sure
you
know.
[laughter]
and
that
would,
obviously,
be
a
harder
case
than
the
one
that
we
have
here,
and...
which
i
would
like
to--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--address
how
you
apply
it
here.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if
a
state
statute
looked
to
federal
law
as
the
source...
i
think
one
has
to
be
careful
when
one
talks
about
"negligence
per
se"
type
principles,
which
is
what
you're
suggesting...
some
states
look
to
statutes
and
regulations
solely
to
establish
a
standard
of
care
once
a
separate
duty
has
been
established.
and
some
states,
as
respondents
claim
arizona
does,
look
to
establish
both
duty
and
a
standard
of
care.
but,
putting
that
aside,
if...
to
respond
directly
to
your
question...
if
a
state
adopted
a
federal
statute
and
used
it
to
apply
to
private
persons,
you
would
be
most
of
the
way
home
in
getting
federal
tort
claims
act...
at
least
the
creation
of
potential
liability
against
the
united
states.
however,
i
think
in
that
instance,
there
would
still
be
a
question
as
to
the
intent
of
congress,
in
the
federal
statute
itself
that
was
used,
as
to
whether
congress
intended
to
foreclose
any
private
action,
any
private
enforcement,
such
that
the
states...
if
the
state
has
misinterpreted,
in
other
words,
a
federal
law,
that
presents,
i
think,
a
federal
question.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
they're
just
simply
borrowing
it,
and
don't
feel
compelled
to
borrow
it,
and
are,
indeed,
applying
it
to
private
persons
who
perform
safety
inspections,
then
the
united
states
could
potentially
be
liable
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
as
i
mentioned
here,
though,
that
is
definitely
not
this
case,
because--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
i
have
several
answers
to
that
question,
justice
kennedy.
first,
your
use
of
"standards"
there
appears
not
to
be
one
to
create
an
actual
duty
in
the
first
instance,
which
is
really
the
question
before
this
court.
is
there
any
duty
between
the
united
states
and
the
private
miners?
secondly--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
realize
you
were
still
operating--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--under
justice--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--stevens'
hypothetical.
if
arizona
has
created
an
actionable
tort
duty
that
it
imposed...
that
it's
willing
to
impose
upon
its
private
citizens
who
perform
safety
inspections,
to
all
persons
who
work
at
places
where
they
perform
safety
inspections,
that
would
be
a
different
case.
then
that
would
be
applying
the
law
as
it
relates
to
private
persons
in
like
circumstances.
here,
though,
it's
clear
from
the
cases
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
including
easter
and
papastathis,
that
arizona...
when
private
parties
perform
safety
inspections
on
the
property
of
another,
arizona
applies
its
good
samaritan
doctrine.
that
is
not...
in
order
to
determine,
at
the
outset,
whether
there's
any
actionable
duty
between
the
inspectors
and
the
injured
party.
that's
the
step
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
engage
in
here.
the
ninth
circuit,
instead,
decided--
okay.
so,
the...
and
the
reason
that
you
can't,
in
this
case,
follow
justice
stevens'
reasoning
is
because
the
only
provisions
of
law
to
which
the
respondents
point
to
set
the
negligence
per
se
principles
are
policy
manuals
and
procedures
of
the
coal...
federal
mine
act
that
apply
only
to
federal
employees.
so,
they
point
to
no
case
or
law
where
these
provisions,
upon
which
they
rely,
would
impose
either
a
duty
or
a
standard
of
care
upon
private
persons
in
arizona.
now,
in
that...
to
distinguish
it...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
in
many
states,
one
would
look
to
federal
standards
for
setting
the
standard
of
care.
and
we
think
that
it
could
be
relevant
here
what
the...
but
you
must
get
over
the
duty
hurdle.
and
that,
respondents
cannot
do
by
looking
to
state
and
governmental
entity
liability.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
just
to
take
your
question,
and
then
maybe
clarify
what
you
mean
by
what--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
can--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
can...
i
can
answer
it
the
26--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--good.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
okay.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
i
think...
obviously,
you
don't
get
to
2680(a)
unless
you've
gotten
through
the
first
part
and
established--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
there's
some
actionable
duty
on
private
persons
in
like
circumstances
and
that
we
might
be
liable.
if
you
do
get
over
that
hurdle...
say,
for
example,
the
state
standard
of
care
with...
in
relation
to
private
parties
is
higher
than
that
required
by
federal
statute...
imagine
a
federal
regulation
that
requires
va
doctors
to--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--take
care
of
their
patients
once
a
day.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
it
can
serve
functions
in
other
instances;
for
example,
if
someone
alleges
that
you
were
following
the
statute,
but
the
statute
was
invalid.
but
i
think
in
terms
of
a...
because
it
goes
on
to
say
whether
or
not
the...
the
regulation--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--is
valid.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor.
i
was
just
saying
it
has
that
other
function.
i
think,
here,
the
short
answer
to
your
question
is,
if
this...
if,
when
you're
talking
about
the...
what's
an
appropriate
standard
of
care
once
one's
established
an
actionable
duty...
if
the
state
law,
as
it
relates
to
private
persons,
set
a
more
stringent
standard
of
care
than
the
federal
regulation,
for
example,
and
the
federal
employee
were
complying
with
the
standard
of
care
set
forth
in
the
federal
regulation--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--this
could
potentially
provide
a
defense,
even
though,
once
you
went
through
the
first
part
of
the
statute--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i'm
not
sure
i--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
must
be
missing
the
thread
of
the
question
somewhere.
i
was
just--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
was
trying
to
make
just--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--a
simple,
modest
point
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--we
may
still
have
a
defense
in--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
situation.
i
think--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that's
correct.
it's
an
important
point--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
i
think
that,
in
fact,
would
be
an
application
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine,
justice
ginsburg.
in
other
words,
i
think
you're
referring
to
the
first
part
of
the...
we
have
an...
we
believe
we
have
an
argument.
and
the
daggett
case,
which
we
cite,
addresses
whether...
i
think
this
is
an
open
question
in
arizona
law
under
their
interpretation
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine...
whether
someone
in
the
position
of
the
united
states
here
is...
has
undertaken
to
render
services
to
another.
because
that's
the
argument
to
which
you're
referring,
i
believe.
and
we
think
there
is
an
argument
that
we
are
not
rendering
services
to
another.
but
that
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
the
good
samaritan
doctrine...
that
is
an
application
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine.
in
other
words,
courts,
when
they...
these
are
all
factors
that
take
into
account
whether
someone
will
have
a
duty,
pursuant
to
the
good
samaritan
doctrine...
one
of
the
factors
is
that
you
must
have
undertaken
to
render
services
to
another.
another
factor,
which
we
think
is
also
relevant
here,
is
whether
or
not
the
injured
party
justifiably
and
detrimentally
relied.
and
we
don't
think...
you
know,
they
have
asked
you
to
decide
this
question...
we
think
this
is
more
appropriate
a
question
for
remand,
but
the
united
states
does
not
believe
that
the
respondents
can
make
out
either
of
those
elements
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine,
and
that
the
united
states,
therefore,
cannot
ultimately
be
liable
only...
under
the
only
available
private
person
analogy.
but
the
important
point
is,
you...
that
is
an
application
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
in
our
view,
it's
the
only
private
person
law
that
respondents
argued
to
the
ninth
circuit.
respondents
have
submitted
a
new
argument
to
this
court
contending
that
governmental
entity
law
and
private
party
law
in
arizona
is
equivalent
in
this
situation.
but
that
is
wrong.
it
is
clear
that
the
state
of
arizona,
as
a
public
policy
matter,
has
decided
to
create
broader,
actionable
tort
duties
on
its
own
governmental
employees,
and
to
expose
itself
and
open
its
own
coffers
to...
when...
to
claims
when
its
employees
have
injured
its
citizens.
but
that
is
not
the
same
law
that
they
apply
to
private
persons,
and
we
know
that
from
the
daggett
case,
which
we
discuss...
i
believe
it's
on
page
6
of
our
reply
brief.
in
the
daggett
case,
that
was
a
case
involving
an
inspection
by
a
county
of
a
swimming
recreation
area,
pursuant
to
mandatory
state
and
county
regulations
that
required
such
inspections.
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
there
held
that
there
was
a
duty
by
the
county
to
a
person
who
had...
who
dove
into
the
swimming
pool
and
was
injured
as
a
result
of
hitting
the
bottom,
that
there
was
an
actionable
duty
running
against
the
county
there
as
a
matter
of
the
state
of
arizona's
decision
to
create
tort
duty
when
its
employees
and
governmental
entities
violate
mandatory
obligations
or
perform
them
negligently.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
not
necessarily,
justice
stevens.
we
think
it's
perfectly
clear,
from
the
text
of
the
statute
and
the
language
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
that
what
they
did
is
improper.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
it
has
not...
the...
whether
or
not
there's
an
equivalency,
whether
or
not
private
persons
are
liable
in
the
same
instances
as
state
and
governmental
entities,
was
not
argued
by
the
respondents
below.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
and,
therefore,
it
was
not
decided.
we
do
not
think...
it
is
a
question
of
state
law,
but
we
think
the
answer
is
very
clear,
because
respondent...
the
only
thing
respondents
point
to
here
to
assert
that
there
is
an
equivalent
are
cases
making
state
and
county
and
governmental
entities
liable.
they
point
to
nothing,
as
they
concede,
cases
involving
private
persons.
so,
there...
if...
we
don't
think
the
court
should
remand,
which
would
be
an
invitation
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
essentially
do,
under
another
guise,
what
it
has
already
done,
which
is
essentially
apply
governmental
entity
liability
to
the
united
states,
in
contradiction
to
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--texas
statute.
if
i
can
finish
my
daggett
answer,
though,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that'll
make
clear
why
the
two
are
distinct
and
why
it
isn't
a
difficult
question
of
arizona
law.
the
daggett
court
went
on
to
decide
that
the
county,
although
it
had
a
duty
to
the
injured
party
pursuant
to
governmental
entity
law,
similar
to
what
the
ninth
circuit
applied
to
us
here,
there
would
be
no
actionable
duty
if
one
applied
the
good
samaritan
doctrine.
it
found
that
none
of
the
second
three
prongs
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
were
met,
and
it
also
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
someone
in
the
position
of
the
county
would
even
be
rendering
services
into
another
sufficient
to
meet
that
part
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine.
so,
we
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the
two
are
not
the
same.
the...
so,
we
would
ask
that
the
court
not
remand,
and
leave
that
question
open,
justice
stevens.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
do
not
know
whether
they
were
actually
sued.
there
are...
their...
i
do
believe
their
liability,
though,
is
that
workers'
comp
is
an
exclusive
remedy
here.
and,
although
it's
not
in
the
record
in
this
case,
the
state
of
arizona
was
also
sued,
and,
according
to
news
reports,
settled
for
substantial
sums
with
both
of
the
respondents.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may
just
start
where
he
ended.
just
to
be
clear,
justice
scalia,
the
point
that
i
was
making
is,
the
only
private
person
law
to
which
respondents
pointed
below
was
that
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine.
that...
whether
or
not
respondents
can
make
out
a
claim
under
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
would
require
meeting
all
of
the
elements
of
that
doctrine.
that
would
be
primarily
a
state
law
question,
but
we
do
think
there's
an
ingredient
of
a
federal
question
there,
especially,
for
example,
in
deciding
whether
or
not
they
reasonably
and
detrimentally
relied.
other
courts
of
appeals,
including
the
sixth
circuit,
in
myers
and
raymer,
have
said
that
the
language
of
the
mine
act
is
relevant
to
whether
or
not
a
party
can
simply
rely
on
the
very...
just
the
bare
existence
of
the
msha...
of
msha's
existence
and
its
inspections,
and
held
that,
given
the
language
in
the
mine
act
that
expressly
leaves
the
safety
of
the
mine
to
the...
primarily
to
the
mine
operators
through
the
assistance
of
the
miners,
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
rely.
here,
it...
this
was
completely
appropriately
decided
by
the
district
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
because
they
came
forward
with
affidavits
that
say
nothing
more
than
that
they
relied
upon
the
existence
of
the
msha
scheme.
and
that,
under
arizona's
good
samaritan
law
in...
taking
into
account
the
federal
scheme,
is
insufficient,
because
it
is
insufficient
under
arizona
law.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
this
is
a
12(b)(1)
and
a
12(b)(6)
motion
to
dismiss,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
it's
also
a
jurisdictional
issue,
so
it
is
possible.
they
came
forward
with
these
reliance
affidavits,
and
i
think
it's
significant
how
little
they
say.
the
reliance
affidavits
would
obviously
not
require
any
discovery
on
their
part
to
indicate
what
their
actions
were,
in
terms
of--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--upon
which
they
were
relying.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
think
that's...
that's
one
of
our
arguments,
that
they
can't
meet
the
good
samaritan
law--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--oh,
no,
your
honor,
they
argued
that
before
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
that.
but,
tellingly,
i
think,
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
the
court
of
appeals...
and
i
think
your
question
has
suggested...
it
seems
that
they
think
there
is
no
liability
there.
the
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
was
that
there
is
no
private
party
analog.
justice
breyer,
if
there
is
no
private
party
analog,
if
you
conclude
that
this
type
of
regulatory
activity
has
no
private
party
analog,
the
only
appropriate
answer
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
that
the
united
states
cannot
be
liable.
you
cannot--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--we
think
that
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
affords
an...
under
this
court's
interpretation,
in
indian
towing,
of
the
"like
circumstances"
doctrine,
we
think
one
could
look
to
the
good
samaritan
principles,
under
which
we
think
we
would
prevail.
if
i
may,
justice
ginsburg,
return--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--we
believe
that
once...
i'm
not
sure
i
get
the
vein
of
your
question,
but
i'll...
the...
if
there
is
no
private
party
analog,
so
there's
no
private
person
in
like
circumstances,
the
united
states
cannot
be
held
liable.
if
there
is
a
private
party
in
like
circumstances,
one
then
must
apply
that
law
to
the
facts
and
the
claims
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
united
states
is
liable.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
the
district
court
did
here,
your
honor,
and
held
that
we
weren't
liable.
if
the
court's
going
to
decide
this
on
the
record,
we
think
the
court
can
decide
on
this
record
that
there
could
not
be
good
samaritan
law
under
arizona
law.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
was...
i
think
it's
fairly
encompassed.
the...
it...
the
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
the
court
applied...
should
have
looked
to
private
person
law.
i
think
if
you
say
yes,
you
could
look
to
that
law
and
conclude
on
this
record
that
there
can't
be
liability.
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
may
turn
back
to
your
point
about
muniz,
i
think
you're
correct
that
they
didn't
specifically...
the
court
in
that
case
didn't
specifically
suggest
what
the
private
analog
might
be
on
remand,
although
it
did
suggest
perhaps
it
would
be
personal
injury
law
as
it
relates
to
private
persons
in
like
circumstances.
but
i
think
the
important
point
in
muniz
on
that
point
is
akin
to
what
i
was
just
making
to
justice
scalia,
which
is
that
the
court
said
there
is
consent
to
sue
here,
so
the
prisoners
may
sue.
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
be
able
to
ultimately
make
out
a
claim
under
private
person
law
is
a
different
question.
so,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
not
a
guarantee
of
monetary
compensation
from
the
united
states.
and
one
cannot
do
what
the
ninth
circuit
did,
which
is
to
keep
looking
for
possible
analogies
in...
under
which
the
result
would
be
that
the
united
states
is
held
liable.
sometimes,
just
like
with
private
party
analogs,
just
like
with
private
safety
inspectors,
the
answer
will
be
the
private
party
can't
be
held
liable
under
the
applicable
private
person
law.
and
in...
the
private
person
law
in
arizona,
i
think
it's
clear,
is
the
good--
i'm
sorry.
time
is
up.
