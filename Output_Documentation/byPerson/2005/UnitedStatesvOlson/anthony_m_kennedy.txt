justice
anthony
m.

do
i
understand
that
you
would
accept
the
rule
that
if
arizona
held
a
private
inspector
liable
to
third
persons
for
their
injuries,
then
the
government
of
the
united
states
would
be
liable?
it's
not
quite
the
good
samaritan...
not
quite
the
good
samaritan
type,
but
you
would
accept
that
as
the
proper
measure
of
your
liability
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yeah.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
gets
ahead
of
the
argument
just
a
little
bit,
but
you
had
a
footnote
about
police
officers.
you
have
a
park
ranger,
federal
employer.
is
the
analog
there
that
we
look
to...
what
the
duties
of
a
private
security
guard
would
be...
what
do
you
do
with
those
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
even
with
the
police
officer,
i
have
to
find
a
private
analog.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
quite
a
foreseeable
possibility.
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
private
safety
inspectors
in
arizona...
i'm
not
sure,
but
if
there
are,
i
assume
that
what
they
do
is,
when
they
go
into
a
particular
industrial
area,
they
look
at
the
safety
standards
for
that
industry,
including
federal
and
state
regulations.
so,
if
you
have
a
mine
inspector,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
his
liability
might
very
well
be
measured
by
whether
or
not
he's
inspected
the
mine
in
accordance
to
federal
safety
standards.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
thought
we
said,
at
the
outset...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
if
arizona
imposes
liability
on
private
safety
inspectors
for
injuries
to
third
persons,
then
the
united
states
would
be
liable
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
just
a
background
question.
i'm
curious,
was
asarco
sued
here,
or...
and
is
its
liability
capped
by
workmen's
comp
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
can
remand
for
that.
what's
here
is,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
there's
liability
based
on
what
the
liability
of
a
state
agent
would
be,
and
that's
just
not
the
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
we
have
to
give
some
instructions
as
to
how
the...
as
to
whether
or
not
the
ninth
circuit
is
right
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
why
you're
here.
