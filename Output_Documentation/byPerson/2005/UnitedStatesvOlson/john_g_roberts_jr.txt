chief

john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
now
hear
argument,
united
states
v.
olson.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
that's
kind
of
a
$64,000
question
here.
give
me
an
example
where
you
think
there's
no
private
person
analog.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
there
always
a
private...
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
tort
law...
isn't
there
always
a
private
analog,
which
is,
you
know,
exercising
reasonable
care
under
the
circumstances
toward
people
to
whom
you
owe
some
duty,
and
you
just
apply
that
general
principle?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
all
right,
so
if
it's
a
police
officer
stopping
somebody
on
a
highway,
it's
the
same
as
a
private
security
guard
stopping
somebody
at
a...
you
know,
the
driveway
at
a
plant
or
something.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
maynard.
mr.
cotter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the...
in
the
face
of
a
district
court
opinion
that
applied
the
good
samaritan
statute
and
threw
the
case
out
because
no
allegation
could
be
made
to
come
within
the
good
samaritan
statute.
so,
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
they're
doing
something
quite
different
from
what
you're
suggesting.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but,
doesn't
that
approach...
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
because
you're
only
looking
at
half
of
the
equation.
presumably,
if
you
have
a
special
set
of
principles
for
governmental
actors,
they
include
immunities
and
defenses
and
all
that.
and
you
just
want
the
benefit
of
the
liability,
but
you
don't
want,
i
take
it,
the
immunities
and
defenses
that
go
along
with
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
make
it
a
contract
case?
if
you're
talking
about
the
party
who's
contracted
with,
say,
a
private
inspector...
i
mean,
i
have
a
contract,
somebody
comes
and
inspects
the
house
for
termites,
and
i
assume,
if
they
don't
do
a
good
job
and
the
house
is
damaged,
they're
liable.
but
that's
under
contract,
and
this
is
a
question
of
tort
liability.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
only...
presumably,
only
if
they
meet
the
requirements
of
the
good
samaritan
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which...
they
would
have
to
show
that
there
was
an
increase
in
the
risk
of
harm,
which
i
think
it
would
not
be
true
in
your
hypothetical,
or
that
there
was
a
duty
owed
to
the
third
party...
the
scaffolding
inspector
is
presumably
hired
by
the
contractor,
not
by
the
employees...
or
there
was
reliance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
we're
just
debating
now
whether
or
not
you've
satisfied
the
requirements
of
the
good
samaritan
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
you
argue...
i
mean,
you
lost
in
the
district
court
on
the
good
samaritan
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
your
appeal,
did
you
argue
that
that
was
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cotter.
ms.
maynard,
you
have
five
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
consider
affidavits
on
a
motion
to
dismiss?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
argument
do
you
have
to
avoid
a
remand
for
consideration
of
liability
under
the
good
samaritan
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
didn't
have
a
chance
to
argue
that
before
the
court
of
appeals,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
think
there
is
a
private
party
analog.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
didn't
bring
cert
on
that
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
maynard.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
in
no.
