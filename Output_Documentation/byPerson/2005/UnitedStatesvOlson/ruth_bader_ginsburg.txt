can
you
back--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--up
in
muniz
a
little
bit?
because
that
was
a
prison
administration.
and
so,
what
is
the
private
party
analog
to
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
recall--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
in
the
decision.
the
phrase
from
the
tort
claims
act
about
"as
a
private
party"
was
repeated,
but
i
don't
remember
any
discussion
of
what
that
private
party
would
be,
in
muniz.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
in
those
days
the
government
was
arguing
it
should
be
like
state
officials.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
an
argument
that
was
made
in
your
brief,
and
i
didn't
fully
grasp
the
thrust
of
it,
in
the...
that
is,
you
said
that
the
mine
safety
and
health
administration
has
a
duty
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
but
not
to
the
mine
operator
and
not
to
the
miner.
if
that
were
true,
then
would
there
be...
you
wouldn't
even
get
to
the
good
samaritan
doctrine,
would
you,
if
the
only
duty
is
to
the
secretary
of
labor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
sure
that
the
good
samaritan
is
the...
is
necessarily
what
the
arizona
law
would
be...
what
the
analog
would
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
justice
kennedy
just
brought
up?
did
this...
did
mr.
olson
collect,
under
the
state
workers'
compensation
statute,
from
the
mine
operators?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
but
the
mine
operator...
the
compensation
act
is
the
exclusive
remedy
under
arizona
law,
so
the...
nobody
could
get
anything
more
from
the
mine
operator.
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
aren't
there,
in
all
kinds
of
situations,
private
inspectors?
one
of
them
that
was
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
i
think,
is
an
elevator
operator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
elevator
operation
inspector.
so,
there's
lots
of
private
inspectors.
there
may
not
be
private
mine
inspectors.
i
don't
know
about
that.
but
this
would
be
inspector
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
the
district
court
went
off
on
discretionary
function?
