justice
ruth
bader

so
was...
there's
a
section
in
the
back
of...
i
think
it's
160(c)...
that
says
if
it's
an
unrelated
transaction,
then...
so,
it
would
be
a
permissive
counterclaim
if
we
had
ordinary
civil
proceedings.
then
there
can
be
a
setoff
to
the
extent
of
the
claim
that's
being
made
against
the
bankrupt
estate.
there
can't
be
any
affirmative
recovery,
as
there
could
be
with
a
permissive...
with
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
but
you're
saying
that
that
section
is
unconstitutional...
160(c)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we're
talking
just
about
vmi,
not
about
the
other
schools,
then
you...
if
this
claim
is
unrelated,
so
that
it
would
be
a
permissive
counterclaim,
then
you
would
say
not
even
against
vmi
could
you
have
the
setoff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
shouldn't
a
setoff
be
a
defense,
even
if
it's
unrelated?
i
mean,
there
were
such
things
in...
at
common
law,
were
there
not,
that
you
could
set
off
an
unrelated
debt?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
meant
a
setoff--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--only--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so,
you're
not...
i
thought
your
position
was,
vmi,
okay.
if
they
filed
a
claim,
then
they're
open
to
affirmative
recovery
if
it's
a
compulsory
counterclaim;
offset,
if
it's
a
permissive
counterclaim.
but
i
thought
you
said,
as
to
the
three
other
schools,
no
waiver.
there's
not...
no
way
you
can
lump
them
in.
i
thought
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in...
i
don't
follow
that,
because
i
thought
the
theory
of
the
cases
were
that
you
can
waive
something
by
conduct.
and
so,
when
you
ask
a
court
for
relief
against
a
party,
then
it's
reasonable
to
say,
"if
you're
coming
in
and
asking
the
court
to
give
you
something,
then
it's
only
fair
that
your
adversary
should
be
able
to--
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--let
me
ask
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
lose
on
the
abrogation
notion,
and
the
court
holds
that
there
is
no
authority
in
congress
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity,
still
the
bankruptcy
code
codifies
what
is,
across
the
board,
the
law.
that
is,
if
you
come
to
a
court
and
say,
"give
me
x
against
d",
that
d
should
be
able
to
come
back
and
say,
"either
i
want
full
relief
because
it's
a
compulsory
type
counterclaim.
"
"i
have
to
bring
it
here.
"
"i
can't
bring
it
separately.
"
"or
at
least
a
setoff.
"
i
mean,
that
was
understood,
that
a
party
over
whom
the
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
otherwise,
is
amendable
to
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
the
extent
of
a
counterclaim
or
a
setoff.
so,
i
don't
see
why
(b)
and
(c)
are
not
discrete
from
(a).
(b)
and
(c)
are
implementing
the
idea
of
a
setoff.
you
come
to
court
for
a
claim,
you
are
deemed
to
have
waived
any
jurisdictional
objection
to
the
counterclaim
or
the
setoff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
hood
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
congress
could
abrogate--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--through
the
bankruptcy
clause.
the...
what...
and
then
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
we
didn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--address
that
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
question
you've
presented,
mr.
thro,
but
it
was
the
same
question
that
was
presented
to
us
in
hood.
and
in
hood,
we
decided
that
we
were
not
going
to
answer
the
question
presented,
we
were
going
to
decide
the
case
on
a
lesser
ground.
so,
the
court,
certainly
if
our
venture
in
hood
was
proper,
here,
too,
we
could
decide
the
case
on
some
other
ground
than
the
one
you
presented
in
your
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
that
would
be
a
ground
to
allow
them
to
present
it
below.
they
had
a
total
winner--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
that
hands
below.
