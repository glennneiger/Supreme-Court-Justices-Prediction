justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
don't
we
say
that
that's
the
exercise
of
the
sovereign
power
of
commerce,
just...
of
congress,
just
like
you
said?
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
mean,
it
seems
that
that
answer
is
just
conclusory,
that
it's
an
exercise
of
the
sovereign
power
of
congress,
okay.
that's
just...
that's
just
a
conclusion.
that's
not
a
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
the
waiver
argument
that's
made
is
properly
before
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
may
be
right
about
that,
but,
while
i've
got
you
here,
let's
assume
just
one
state
entity,
not
multiple
state
entities.
and
the
state
has
received
a
preferential
transfer
of
$2,000.
it
still
has
an
outstanding
claim...
a
different
claim
against
the
same
bankrupt
for
$1,000.
and
it
goes
in
to
enforce
its
claim
for
$1,000.
could
we
hold,
consistently
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
that
that
is
a
waiver?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
different
claim.
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--one,
the
state
received
$2,000
worth
of
taxes,
but
it...
still
have
its
$1,000
contract
claim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'd
like
to
get
away
from
in
rem
and
back
to
the
waiver
aspect
that's
being
argued
here.
let's
assume
that
there
is
an
offset
obligation
that
the
state
has
to
comply
with,
that
there's
been
a
preference
and
it
has
another
claim,
and
with
just
one
entity.
if
that's
true,
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
unfair
to
say
that
the
state
can
proceed
on
multiple
fronts
with
different
entities
and
fractionate
its
immunity
so
that
if
there
are
more
than
three
entities...
or
if
there
are
three
or
four
entities,
each
one
is
judged
separately
as
to
the
offset
obligation.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
state
entity
is
subject
to
offset,
then
all
of
them
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
otherwise,
the
state
immunity,
it
seems
to
me,
can
be...
can
be
fractionated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought,
with
respect
to
justice
ginsburg's
colloquy...
and
my
own,
earlier...
that
we
said
that
there
is
an
offset
obligation,
even
if
they're
different
claims.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
now...
and
now
i
want
to
extrapolate
from
that
to
multiple
entities,
each
of
which
asserts
its
own
immunity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
take
your
time.
we're
interested--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
it's
the
same
question.
but
let's
say
that
the
court
thinks
there
might
be
merit
to
the
argument
of
waiver,
that
the
state
entity
comes
in
asking
to
be
treated
as
a
creditor,
and
its
preference
is
then
before
the
bankruptcy
court.
how
is
that
issue
preserved
in
the
question
you
raise?
you
say,
maybe
the
congress
used
article
1
to
abrogate
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
just
seems
to...
seem
to
me
to
be
part
of
the
question
presented.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
asked...
you
framed
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
no,
you...
you're
right.
you're
right.
you're
exactly
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
proof
of
claim
in
vmi
was
$43,000,
and
the
preference
was
$25,000.
