bankruptcy
clause
presumably
does
not
allow
congress
to
set
up
the
bankruptcy
law
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
amount
to
a
taking
of
property
without
just
compensation,
right?
wouldn't
allow
another
constitution
to
be
violated.
so
the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
constitutional
protection
of
states'
sovereign
immunity
can
be
taken
away
by
the
bankruptcy
clause;
whereas,
other
provisions
clearly
can,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say...
to
say
that
the
state
can't
be
sued
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
the
state
can
sue,
is
it?
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can
prevent
the
state
from
suing,
even
though
you
can't
sue
the
state.
there's
no
incompatibility,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
a...
the
intangible
of
a
contract
claim
is
part
of
the
estate,
too,
right?
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but,
i
mean,
you
could
be...
there's
no
less
reason
to
say
that
that's
part
of
the
res
than
there
is
to
say
that
the
preferential
transfer
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
could
have
a
contract
action
that...
in
which
the
state
promises
to
turn
over
a
particular
parcel
of
land
that
it
owns,
or
even,
for
that
matter,
a
gold
bar
that
is
on
somebody's...
some
state
functionary's
desk.
and
i
guess
you
could
have
a
suit
for
that
gold
bar
or
for
the
piece
of
property.
and
i
guess
you
could
call
that
an
in
rem
action,
if
you
wanted
to.
but
it
wouldn't
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
rescission
action
in
which
the
private
party
has
conveyed
property
to
the
state,
and
the
state
doesn't
pay,
and
the
private
party
seeks
to
rescind
the
action
and
to
receive
back
the
property
that
it
turned
over,
which
is
real
estate
or
a
gold
bar?
could
that
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
be
a...
characterized
as
an
in
rem
action?
he's
seeking
back
the
property
he
gave
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
against
the
entire
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--including
any
money
owed
to
the
other...
to
the
other
state
institutions.
you
acknowledged
that
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--offset
could
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--applied
not
just
against
the
college
here,
but
against
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--other
entities.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
saying
that
much
of
the
language
of
(b)
is
ineffective
and
superfluous?
(b)
certainly
tries
to
limit
it.
it
says
"has
waived
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
a
claim
against
such
governmental
unit
that
is
property
of
the
estate
and
that
arose
out
of
the
same
transaction.
"
you're
just
saying
all
of
that
is
ineffective,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
what
context
would
it
be
effective?
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
again,
i
still
don't
see
how
you
distinguish
(b)
when
you
say
"(b)
doesn't
apply
here,
it
may
apply
in
other
cases.
"
if
it
doesn't
apply
here,
why
would
it
apply
in
other
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
you
are
appealing
to
this
broader
principle,
that
you
either
waive
all
of
sovereign
immunity
or
you
waive
none
of
it
at
all,
and
you
can't
just
restrict
it
to
the
particular
claim,
which
is
what
(b)
says,
i
don't
know
why,
in
any
case,
that
wouldn't
be
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
happy
halloween.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
were,
but
you're
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--trying
to
get
rid
of
that,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
explain
to
me
again
why
it's
okay
that
your
waiver
argument
below
was
only
directed
to
the
claims
against
vmi?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not...
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
to
that.
you
made
a
much
narrower
argument
there
than
you're
making
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't...
you
didn't
assert
that
all
the
sovereign
immunity
for
the
entire
state
and
all
of
its
institutions
had
been
waived
simply
because
of
the
claim
by
vmi.
you
didn't
make
that
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
which
said
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
why
didn't
you
make
the
argument?
i
mean,
if
hood
said,
when
you
make
a
partial...
or
one
institution...
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
hood
said
that
a
waiver
by
one
institution
waives
for
the
whole
state.
is
that...
is
that
what
hood
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you're
making
a
separate
waiver
argument,
apart
from
the
abrogation
argument,
i
don't
see
why
you
would
not
make
that
waiver
argument
as
broadly
as
possible.
it's
a
separate
argument
from
the
abrogation
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
making
it
as
a
separate
argument
here.
but
here,
you're
making
it
as
to
all
claims
against
all
state
institutions;
whereas,
below
you
made
it
only
as
to
the
claims
against
vmi.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
couldn't
decide
it
in
your
favor,
on
some
alternative
ground,
though,
could
we?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that
distinguishes
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
difference
between
this
and
hood.
