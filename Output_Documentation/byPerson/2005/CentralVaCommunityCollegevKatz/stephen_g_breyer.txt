justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tell
me,
if
you're...
if
you're
right...
let's
suppose
you're
right.
i'm
over
here.
that's--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
right.
so,
it's
hard
to
figure
out,
because
the
direction...
you
can't
tell
by
the
sound.
i
don't
know
if
there's
a
modern
system
that
would
help
with
that,
but...
you're
right.
suppose
that
the
state...
suppose
you're
right.
what
i'd
worry
about...
and
i'd
like
your
response
to
this...
is
that
in
bankruptcies,
or
weak
firms...
a
lot
of
firms
are
weak,
and
they
owe
a
lot
of
money
to
the
states.
so,
the
states
figure
this
out
after
a
while.
it
takes
a
few
years
to
seep
through,
but
once
they
see
what
they
can
do,
they
say,
"here's
what
we'll
do.
"
"settle
your
claims
against
the
state,
which
happen
to
be
pretty
good,
for
50
cents
on
the
dollar.
"
"give
us
the
money.
"
"and
you're...
we're
out
of
it.
"
so,
they
settle
it.
a
month
later,
phhht,
bankrupt.
now,
two
things
have
happened.
the
states
got
50
cents
on
the
dollar,
every
other
creditor
gets
5
cents
on
the
dollar,
because
they
were
a
month
ahead
of
it.
the
second
thing
that
happened
is,
the
creditor...
the
firm
lost
the
chance
to
come
in
and
be
rehabilitated.
so,
the
result
of
this
is
two
bad
things,
bankruptcy's
law's
basic
purpose,
to
treat
creditors
fairly,
bankruptcy
law's
basic
purpose,
to
give
firms
a
chance
to
rehabilitate,
are
both
seriously
undermined.
so,
given
the
bankruptcy
clause
in
the
constitution,
how
is
it
possible
to
say
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
prevent
those
two
very,
very
seriously
harmful
results...
harmful
in
terms
of
the
basic
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
not
a
tort
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
there
is
not
a
contract
clause.
and
there
is
a
bankruptcy
clause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
(b)
and
(c)...
tell
if
i'm
right
about
this...
but
suppose
an
individual
bankruptcy,
and
sometime
prior
to
the
bankruptcy
the
individual
got
into
an
automobile
accident
and
ran
into
a
state
building
and
wrecked
it.
all
right?
now,
i
take
it
that,
in
a
state
that
hasn't
waived
sovereign
immunity,
that
individual,
were
he
not
bankrupt,
might
not
be
able
to
bring
a
lawsuit
for
his
damages
caused
by
a
claim
that
the
wall
was
too
high
or
something.
each
is
claiming
the
other
is
negligent.
i
guess
the
person
wouldn't
be
able
to
file.
and
the
fact
that
he's
bankrupt,
he
couldn't,
either.
okay.
now,
in
(b),
i
guess
it's
saying
that
if
the
state
happens
to
come
in,
after
he's
gone
bankrupt,
and
brought
his
negligent
suit
against
him,
he
can
respond.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if,
in
fact,
you
were
to
lose
on
(a),
i
guess
the
whole
section
would
fall,
because
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
anymore,
and
we'd
just
wipe
out
the
whole
thing,
(a),
(b),
and
(c).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
then
the
case
really
turns
on
the
extent
to
which
the
government
can...
sorry,
the
extent
to
which
congress
can
waive
sovereign
immunity,
as
they
seem
to
have
waived
it
in
(a),
whether
the
constitution
permits
them
to
do
what
they
did
in
(a).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
win
on
that,
you
win.
and
if
you
lose
on
that,
the
whole
section
106
would
probably
fall.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure,
because
if
you
lose
on
the
whole
thing...
suppose
you
were
to
say
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
to
do
anything
there.
i
just
wonder
if
(b)
and
(c)
would
survive,
because
they
may
have
had
something
else
in
mind.
but
maybe
that's
too
complicated
to
go
into
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no,
he's...
so,
i'm
wrong.
what
i
said
is
wrong.
the
answer
has
to
be
that...
we're
only
talking
about
(a)
at
the
moment.
and
what
congress
tried
to
do
in
(a)
is
abrogate
sovereign
immunity
insofar
as
it
is
constitutional
to
do
so.
so,
then,
you
say,
if
you
lose
on
it,
it's
unconstitutional
for
it
to
do
so
here,
but
it
could...
it
is
constitutional
for
it
to
do
so
insofar
as
there
is
this
situation
that
the
state
brings
a
case
against
the
estate,
and
you
can
do
an
offset,
et
cetera.
but
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
(b)
and
(c).
it
would
have
to
do
with
reading
that
into
(a),
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
light
bulb
went
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
would
not?
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
have
some
of
those.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
trying
to
get
those
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
okay.
