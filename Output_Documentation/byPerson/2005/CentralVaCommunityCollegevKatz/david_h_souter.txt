what
if
the--
justice
david
h.

--go--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
thro,
i...
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
if
the...
if
the
preference
in
a
case
like
this,
that
had
been
given
to
the
state,
were
not
a
bank
transfer,
a
check,
but
were
some
tangible
object,
like
a
gold
bar,
that
there
would
be
in
rem
jurisdiction
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
get
the
gold
bar
back
as
a...
even
though
its
function
is
that
of
a
preferential
transfer?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's...
with
respect
to...
i
mean,
you
can
say
that
of
any
claim
that
is
valued
in
dollars.
but,
i
mean,
your...
you
know,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
your
position
that
there
is
no
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
the
contract
action
and
the
preferential
transfer.
and
my
point
was,
some
transfers
might
be
satisfied...
might
be
sought
in
what,
at
least
in
the
traditional
classification,
would
be
an
in
rem,
rather
than
an
in
personam,
action.
would
your
answer
be
any
different
if
the...
if
the
gold
bar
were
simply
sitting
on
the...
on
the
desk
of
some
state
purchasing
agent,
as
opposed
to
deposited
in
the...
in
the
state
treasury
or
sold
by
the
state
for
the
monetary
value?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
effect,
you're
saying
there
are
some
in
rem
exceptions,
but
not
all
in
rem
actions
are
exceptions.
and
this
would
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
because--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
we
normally
deal
with
that
as
specific
performance
of
the
contract,
and
what...
you
know
it's
in
rem,
in
the
sense
that
we're
talking
about
an
object,
but
that's
not
what
we
mean,
traditionally,
by
"in
rem
jurisdiction",
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
you
sue...
in
effect,
you
sue
the
race,
rather
than--
justice
david
h.
souter
--than
the
person.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
the...
in
a...
in
a
specific
performance
contract
action,
you
sue
the
person.
justice
david
h.
souter
assuming
that's
so,
for
sovereign
immunity
purposes,
why
should
it
make
a
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
i
mean,
this
is
a
tougher
case,
but
if
sovereign
immunity
is
the
issue,
why
does
it
make
any
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
theory
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
believe
me,
i...
i
mean,
i...
as
you
know,
i'm
not
a
big
fan
of
sovereign
immunity
in
these
circumstances,
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
to
get
around
it,
based
on
the
fact
that
there
is
no
alternative
remedy
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
then,
basically,
you're
making
the
argument
from
the
uniformity
phrase...
uniform
bankruptcy
laws.
that's
essentially
your
argument.
and
you're
saying,
in
the...
in
this
case,
that
that
trumps
the
sovereign
immunity,
and
that
gets
you
out
of
seminole
tribe.
