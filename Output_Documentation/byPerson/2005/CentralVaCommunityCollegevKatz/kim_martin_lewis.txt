ms.
kim
martin
lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the...
if
the
states
are
permitted
to
opt
out
of
the
collective
bankruptcy
process,
and
they're
permitted
to
disregard
federal
preference
statutes
with
impunity,
it
will
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
bankruptcy
process.
states
are
large
creditors.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
your
honor,
in
the
florida
prepaid
case,
there
was
an
alternative
state
remedy.
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
could
sue
the
state
of
florida...
i'm
sorry...
yes,
could
sue
the
state
of
florida
in
that
particular
case.
in
this
case,
they
can't
do
that.
there
is
a...
an
estate
representative,
who
has
one
option,
and
that
option,
to
preserve
the
collective
benefit
of
the
estate,
is
to
sue
the
estate...
or
to
sue
the
state
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
for...
well--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--i
do
believe
that
it
makes
a
difference
that
there
is
no
alternative
remedy.
however,
in
this
case,
i
don't
think--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--i'm
not
sure
that
it
has
anything
to
do,
directly,
with
the
theory
of
sovereign
immunity,
but--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--well,
justice
souter,
the
thing
that
i
think
is
very
troubling
in
this
case
is
that
there's
a
very
basic
bankruptcy
policy,
and
that
basic
bankruptcy
policy
on
preferences
is
equality
of
distribution
and
to
prevent
of
abusive
debt
collection
practices
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
i
believe
that
it...
i
believe
that
it
does,
your
honor.
but
i...
i'm
not
sure
the
court
even
has
to
reach
the
uniformity
argument
in
this
case,
because
the
fact
that
virginia
military
institute,
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
waived
its
sovereign
immunity.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
justice
o'connor,
the...
vmi
waived
the
only
sovereign
immunity
that
existed,
which
was
the
commonwealth
of
virginia's
sovereign
immunity.
and,
as
a
result...
all
of
the
agencies
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
served
as
unitary
creditors...
and
so,
when
vmi
waived
the
only
sovereign
immunity
that
existed,
there
was
nothing
left
to
waive.
and,
at
that
point,
the
recoveries
of
the
estate...
which
were
recoveries
against
other
agencies,
not
only
vmi...
were...
the
respondent
was
permitted
to
bring
those
actions.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
chief
justice,
it's
not
under
106(b)
or
106(c),
because
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity...
106(a)
provides
that,
with
respect
to
preference
claims--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--that--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
106(b)
or
106(c)
limits
the
waiver
in
this
case,
because,
again,
the
sovereign
immunity
that
was
waived
was
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
and
so,
the
claims
that
were
asserted
in
that
action,
the
preference
actions
that
are
served
against
vmi
and
the
other
institutions,
are
preserved,
because
we
can--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--i'm
saying
that,
in
this
context,
it
isn't...
it
isn't
effective,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
the...
106(b)
was
intended
for
claims
that
didn't...
that
did
not
arise
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
106(a)
claims,
which
was
the
abrogation
of
sovereign
immunity,
are
claims
that
arise
under
the
code.
106(b)
and
106(c),
there
is
no
sovereign
immunity
to
waive.
so,
106(b)
and
106(c)
were
designed
for
the
contract
claims
that
justice
scalia
referred
to
earlier
in
the
petitioner's
argument.
and
then
we
looked
to
the
federal...
this
court's
jurisprudence
with
respect
to
what
constitutes
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
we
would
most
naturally
look
at
the
lapides
case,
in
which...
in
which
a
state
came
into
this...
removed
a
case
from
state
to
federal
court,
and
the
court
said
it
didn't
matter
the
type
of
claim
that
was
being
asserted,
or
that
there
was
affirmative
recovery
that
was
being
asserted,
but,
in
fact,
they
constituted
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
the
state
certainly
can't
say,
here,
that
they
didn't
know
the
filing
of
a
proof
of
claim
would
constitute
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
because
back
in
1947,
in
the
gardner
versus
new
jersey
case,
this
court
acknowledged
that
filing
a
proof
of
claim
constituted
a
waiver.
and
there
are
ways
that
a
state
could
avoid
this.
they
could
have
a
process
by
which
they
had
to
go
through...
whether
it
be
the
attorney
general's
office,
or
whomever...
that
in
order
to
file
a
proof
of
claim,
they
had
to
first
go
somewhere
to
get
authority
to
do
that.
and
that
most
naturally
happens
with
corporations,
because,
as
this
court
is
aware
in
the
granfinanciera
case,
if
you...
if
you
assert
a
proof
of
claim,
you
waive
your
jury
trial
right.
and
that
is
a
large
issue
for
corporations--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--i'm
sorry,
can
you--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--i
don't
think
106(b)
applies
with
respect
to
the
preference
claims,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
the...
in...
106(b)
and
106(c)
specifies
the
conduct
by
which
a
sovereign
must...
must
engage
in,
in
order
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
in
a
noncore
matter,
in
those
matters
not
set
forth
in
section
106--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
that
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity
is
not
absolute,
that
a
sovereign
can
waive
that
sovereign
immunity.
and
it
did,
in
gardner
versus
new
jersey.
and,
again,
this
court
looked
at
that
in
the
lapides
case.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
your
honor--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--justice
scalia,
again,
it's
because
we
do
not
believe
106(b)
governs
here,
because
it
deals
with
claims
that
are
not
abrogated
under
106(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
bankruptcy
is
different
in
other
contexts.
and
i
think
that
it's
very
important
to
talk
about
bankruptcy
differently.
this
court
has
looked
at,
in...
just
last
term,
in
the
hood
case,
which
was
the
debtor's
discharge.
and
the
court
said
that
that
constituted
in
rem
authority.
this
court,
in
perez
versus
campbell,
said
that
somebody
cannot
be
denied
a
driver's
license
simply
because
they
failed
to
play
a
discharged
obligation.
the
court,
in
the
irving
trust
case,
said
that
a
state
is
required
to
satisfy
the
procedure
of
bankruptcy
if
they
want
to
participate
in
the
claims
process.
in
van
huffel
and
straton,
this
court
said
that
a
bankruptcy
estate
is
permitted
to
sell
property
free
and
clear
of
the
state's
tax
liens.
in
whiting
pools,
this
court
said
the
irs,
who
seized
property
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy
on
behalf
of
a...
of
a
lien,
had
to
return
that
in
its
in
rem
jurisdiction.
and
i
believe
it
was
justice
o'connor
who
asked
the
question
of
petitioner
with
respect
to,
how
would
this
affect
the
automatic
stay?
and
how
i've
thought
of
that
is,
sometimes
the
automatic
stay,
there
may
be
an
effect
with
respect
to
monetary
relief,
and
there
may
be
an
effect
as
far
as
an
injunctive
relief.
for
example,
if
there
was
a
judgment
that
a
state
had,
prior
to
bankruptcy,
against
the
estate,
and
then
sought
to
enforce
the
judgment,
executed
on
the
debtor's
bank
accounts
post
petition,
debtor
didn't
know
about
it,
because,
in
a...
in
a
debtor's
reorganization,
the
first
month
of
the
debtor's
bankruptcy,
you
can't...
you're
not
following
everything
that's
happening
in
the
case.
there
is
an
execution
on
the
bank
account,
the
money
is
taken
into
the
state's
coffers.
does
that
mean
that
the
state
is
bound
by
the
automatic
stay,
or
is
the
state
not
bound
by
the
automatic
stay?
it
was
money
that
was
transferred
from
one...
from
the
estate
to
the
state.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
was...
it
was
a--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--right,
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
i
believe
106
would
fall,
but,
if
106
falls,
doesn't
mean
that
respondent
would
lose,
as
far
as
the
waiver
argument,
because--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
(b)
and
(c),
as
pointed
out
by
another
one
of
the
justices,
may
be
a
limitation
on
the
general
concept
of
common
law
waiver.
so,
to
the
extent
that
106
would
be...
this
court
were
to
rule
(b)
that
would...
unconstitutional,
you
would
look
to
the
general
common
law
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
would
be
the
gardner
versus
new
jersey
case
and
the
lapides
case.
the--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--we
believe,
obviously,
congress
had
the
right
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--that's
correct.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
that's
correct.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
well,
your
honor,
i
believe,
because
this
court
has
recognized,
in
gardner
versus
new
jersey,
that
if
a
state
files
a
proof
of
claim,
it
constitutes
a
waiver,
that
the
state
had
to
have
to
been
informed,
it
had
to
know
that
the
actual
conduct
of
filing
a
proof
of
claim
would
have
a
consequence
of
a
waiver.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
all--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--that's
correct--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--your
honor.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
that's
correct.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
well,
your
honor,
106(a)
certainly
didn't
exist
back
in
gardner
versus
new
jersey
in
1947
either.
and
i
think
that
the...
the
fact
that...
if
sovereign
immunity
exists,
sovereign
immunity
can
be
waived.
i'm
not
sure--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--i
believe
that's
correct--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--justice
breyer.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
i
understand
that
argument,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
believe
when
congress
enacted
106(a),
(b),
and
(c),
that
they
enacted
it...
(a),
being
those
actions
which
were
abrogated,
(b)
were
those
actions
that
remained.
and
those
actions
that
remained,
there
were
limitations
to
that
waiver.
because
this
is
not...
there
was
nothing
to
waive
on
sovereign
immunity
on
106(b)
as
to
preference
actions,
for
example.
contract
claims
are
different.
contract
claims
would
have...
are
not
abrogated
under
106(a),
so,
therefore,
the
only
way
they
can
be
waived
is
under
106(b).
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
did
you
ask
how
it's
preserved?
we
raised
the--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--your
honor,
i
think,
to
the
extent
that
this
court
can
avoid
addressing
the
constitution
about
constitutionality
of
a
statute...
and,
in
the
situation
of
waiver,
we
believe
that
it
can...
then
we
believe
that's
the
appropriate
jurisprudence.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
chief
justice,
it
was
raised,
to
the
extent
of
vmi's
sovereign
immunity.
and
the
reason
that
it
was
is,
at
the
time
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed,
as
recognized
by
the
petitioner
in
their
brief,
and
as
recognized
by
the
court,
at
the
bankruptcy
court
level,
the
hood
decision
at
the
sixth
circuit
had
been
a
decision.
and
so,
there
was
no
necessity
for
the
court
to
engage
into
any
other
proceedings,
other
than
to
deal
with
the
hood
decision.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
justice
stevens,
we
did
seek
to
dismiss
the
causative
action
with
respect
to
the
accounts
receivable
and
the
causative
action
that
we--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--they
would
not
be
part
of
the
estate--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--in
a
situation
of...
if
this
adopt...
court
adopted
an
in
rem
theory,
that's
correct.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
any
recoveries
on
behalf
of
state
contract
claims,
account
receivable
as
collections.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
we
do,
your...
justice
breyer.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
no,
we
are
not.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
we
sought
to
dismiss
them.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
that's
correct,
justice--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--scalia.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
it
would
have
been
the
waiver
with
respect
to
just
vmi's
contract
claims.
and,
i
apologize,
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
don't
recall
what
the
value
of
just
the
vmi
contract
claims
would
have
been.
but
that's
what
we
believe
the
waiver
would
have
been
limited
to.
it
would
have
not
included
the
contract
claims
of
central
virginia
community
college,
blue
ridge.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
at
the--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--i--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--at
the
time
of
that
decision,
justice--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--scalia,
the
sixth
circuit
hood
decision
had
already
been
decided,
and,
just
as
it
was
acknowledged
in
the--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--which
said
that
sovereign
immunity
is
waived,
or
abrogated,
for
preference
actions
in...
it
was
actually
across
the
board...
an
abrogation
of
state
sovereign
immunity.
and,
at
that
point,
there
was
notice--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--no.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
that's
correct.
congress
could--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--we--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--at
the
time,
106(a),
in
the
sixth
circuit,
it
was
determined
that
that
was
constitutional.
so,
at
the
time,
the
only
thing
left
for
the
states
to
waive
was
the
contract
actions.
and
the
contract
actions
of
vmi
were
the
only
things
that
could
be
waived
as
part
of
the--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--underlying--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--that's
correct,
chief--
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
--justice.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
that's
correct.
ms.
kim
martin
lewis
in
the
nordic
village
case,
the
trustee
in
that
case
focused
on
the
money
damages.
they
didn't
focus
on
the
portion
of
the
preference
statute
that
says
you
can
get
the
transfer
back,
you
can
get
the
property
back.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
bowen
versus
massachusetts,
just
because
it
is
monetary
relief
doesn't
mean
that
it's
money
damages.
and
that's
how
we
distinguished
the
nordic
village
case,
your
honor.
the...
this
court,
i
believe,
would
be
extending
the
article...
its
jurisprudence
if
it
permitted
the
bankruptcy
estate
not
to
be
able
to
sue
the
states.
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
private
citizen,
indian
tribes,
and
foreign
sovereigns
cannot
be
sued.
but
this
court's
never
recognized
a
federal
entity
cannot
pursue
a
state.
and
this
court...
this
is
a
situation
where
there
is
no
alternative
remedy.
we
aren't
in
a
situation
where
we
have
the
ada,
the
adea,
where
the
eeoc
can
bring
an
action
on
behalf
of
the
government
and
on
behalf
of
the
individuals
to
enforce
a
federal
law.
we
have
no
other
enforcement
in
bankruptcy,
other
than
the
collective
bankruptcy
process,
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
the
bankruptcy
code
assigns
to
the
debtor
in
possession,
or
to
the
trustee,
the
ability
to
collect
on
behalf
of
the
estate.
bankruptcy
is
unique
in
its
very
in
rem
application
and
its
very
narrow
and
specialized
enforcement
of
the
bankruptcy
system.
the
framers
recognized
the
critical
nature
of
binding
the
states
in
a
uniform
scheme.
the
decision
below
ought
to
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
in
rem,
on
the
