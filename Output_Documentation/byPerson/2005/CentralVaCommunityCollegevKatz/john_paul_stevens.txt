justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
may
i
ask,
how
do
you...
how
do
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
you're
bound
by
the
automatic
stay
and
the
discharge?
why
aren't
those
also
an
infringement
of
state
sovereignty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
it
at
least
be
theoretically
possible
to
differentiate
between
setting
aside
a
preference,
on
the
one
hand,
and
just
bringing
a
suit
for
a
tort
or
a
breach
of
contact,
on
the
other?
one
could
treat
the
assets
that
are...
were
transferred
prematurely...
or
hastily,
whatever
you
call
it...
as
part
of
the
estate.
at
least
it's
conceptually
possible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
congress--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--has
drawn
that
very
distinction
hadn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
said
congress
has
drawn
the
distinction
that...
between
the
preferential
claim
and
the
contract
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
theory
of
the
second
is
that
you're
not
augmenting
the
estate,
you're
merely
preserving
the
estate,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
congress
had
thought
it
had
successfully
abrogated,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
provide
for
a
waiver,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
on
another
subject,
just
talking
for
a
minute
about
your
in
rem
theory
of
the
case?
and
i
understand
you
would
contend
that
assets
have
been
subject
to
a
fraudulent
transfer
or
a
preference
should
be
deemed
to
be
part
of
the
estate.
but
is
it
not
true
that
this
case
also
involves
a
claim
on
the
accounts
receivable?
and
do
you
contend
they
also
should
be
treated
as
part
of
the
estate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
because
you
concede,
in
effect,
that
they
would
not
be
part
of
the
estate
if
we
adopted
an
in
rem
theory
that
included
the
preferential
transfers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
that
doesn't
fit
into
your
in
rem
theory,
but
why
wouldn't
you
have
been
able
to
recover
that
on
a
waiver
theory?
if
you...
and
i
understand
your
waiver
argument
is,
you
can
defend
the
judgment
on
the
ground
not...
you
know,
any
ground
to
uphold
the
judgment
is
okay
for
the
respondent.
but
why
wouldn't
you
have
tried
to
defend
that
part
of
your
case
on
the
waiver
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
you
think,
within
the
text
of
the
question
presented,
we
could
decide
whether
the
sovereign
immunity
was
abrogated
by
the
convention
itself,
not
by
congress?
there
is
that
argument
out
there,
you
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
abrogated.
