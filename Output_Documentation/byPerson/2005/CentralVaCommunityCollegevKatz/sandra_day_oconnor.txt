justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
tell
us
how
often
states
are
creditors
in
bankruptcies
around
the
country?
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
if
you're
correct,
how
would
the
result
you
want
affect
all
the
other
creditors
in
these
bankruptcies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
probably,
on
your
theory,
states
can
disregard
the
automatic
stay
that
issues--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
a
bankruptcy--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--commences?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
is
that,
on
your
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
wouldn't
the
sovereign
immunity
extend
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
there
are
situations
where,
notwithstanding
the
sovereign
immunity
of
states,
there
can
be
in
rem
jurisdiction
in
a
court
to
resolve
claims
against
property--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
bind
the
state,
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
bankruptcy
estates
are
one
such
instance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
thro,
doesn't
the
respondent
want
to
dismiss
the
contract
claims
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
so,
why
do
you
insist
that
they
be
adjudicated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
why--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--why
should
we
force
a
plaintiff
below
to
pursue
claims
they
want
to
give
up?
that
just
seems
so
odd
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but,
of
course,
that
doesn't
hold
true
for
the
other
agencies,
necessarily,
unless
you
think
vmi
can
waive
it
for
all
of
them.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
only
a
partial
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
light
bulb
exploded.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
on
your
in
rem
argument,
how
do
you
distinguish
nordic
village's
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
since
justice
stevens
is
not
with
us
this
morning,
i
announce
this
on
his
behalf.
the
case
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
6th
circuit.
we
granted
review
to
decide
further
the
bankruptcy
clause
of
the
constitution
gives
congress
the
power
to
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
the
debtor
here,
wallace's
bookstores,
had
had
dealings
with
a
number
of
virginia
state
agencies
before
going
into
bankruptcy.
once
the
bankruptcy
petition
was
filed,
bernard
katz,
the
court-appointed
liquidating
supervisor,
brought
actions
against
the
state
agencies
to
recover
preferential
money
transfers
made
to
them
by
the
debtor
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy.
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
all
rejected
the
state
agencies’
argument
that
the
eleventh
amendment
rendered
them
immune
from
the
recovery
actions.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
stevens
and
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm.
bankruptcy
involves
the
marshalling
of
the
debtor’s
assets,
the
equitable
distribution
of
that
property
among
creditors
and
the
ultimate
discharge
that
gives
the
debtor
a
fresh
start.
at
its
core,
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
is
in
rem.
as
such,
its
exercise
does
not
implicate
state
sovereign
immunity
to
the
same
degree
as
other
kinds
of
jurisdiction,
even
when
the
state’s
interests
may
be
affected.
the
history
of
the
bankruptcy
clause
and
the
bankruptcy
legislation
enacted
soon
after
its
ratification
reflect
the
framers’
understanding
the
congress
could
authorize
bankruptcy
courts
not
just
to
render
in
rem
adjudications,
but
also
to
issue
compulsory
orders
in
aid
of
those
adjudications.
the
peculiar
nature
of
bankruptcy
jurisdiction,
combined
with
the
history
of
the
bankruptcy
power,
persuades
us
of
the
following:
the
states
agreed
in
the
plan
of
the
convention
not
to
assert
sovereign
immunity
in
proceedings
like
those
at
issue
here,
proceeding
seeking
turnover
of
preferential
transfers.
we
do
not
rest
our
decision
on
any
express
statement
congress
has
made
on
the
subject
of
state
sovereign
immunity;
the
relevant
abrogation
is
the
one
reflected
in
the
plan
of
the
convention,
not
by
statute.
congress
may
at
its
option
either
treat
states
like
other
creditors
insofar
as
concerns
laws
on
the
subject
of
bankruptcies
or
exempt
them
from
operation
of
those
laws.
the
opinion
is
joined
by
me
and
by
justices
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
