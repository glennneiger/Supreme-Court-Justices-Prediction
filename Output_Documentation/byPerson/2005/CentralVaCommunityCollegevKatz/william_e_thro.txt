mr.
william
e.
thro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
involves
a
conflict
between
two
constitutional
values.
on
the
one
hand,
congress
has
the
sovereign
power
to
make
laws
which
apply
to
everyone,
including
the
states.
on
the
other
hand,
the
states
have
sovereign
immunity
from
all
aspects
of
suit.
in
the
past,
this
court
has
reconciled
this
conflict
by
drawing
a
line
between
sovereign
power
and
sovereign
immunity.
states
are
bound
by
federal
law,
but
the
states
are
immune
from
monetary
damages
for
violations
of
those
laws.
in
the
bankruptcy
context,
this
line
means
the
states
are
bound
by
the
discharge
decisions,
but
that
the
states
are
immune
from
the
trustee's
attempts
to
augment
the
estate
through
monetary
judgment.
mr.
william
e.
thro
there
is
some
information
to
that
effect
in
the
amicus
brief
of
ohio
and
every
other
state
of
the
union,
justice
o'connor,
but
my
recollection
is
that
the
states
are
creditors
in
probably
the
majority
of
bankruptcies
around
the
country.
mr.
william
e.
thro
it
would
have
some
impact
on
the
other
creditors,
in
that
you
would
not
be
able
to
augment
the
estate
by
collecting
a
monetary
judgment
from
the
state.
mr.
william
e.
thro
no,
not
at
all--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
thro
no.
under
our...
under
our
theory,
the...
theory,
the
states
are
bound
by
the
automatic
stay.
the
states
are
also
bound
by--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--well,
because--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--the
automatic
stay
is
an
exercise
of
sovereign...
of
the
sovereign
power
of
congress,
just
as
the
discharge
decisions
of
a
bankruptcy
court
are
an
exercise
of
the
sovereign
power
of
congress.
the
states
are
bound
by
the
discharge
decisions.
states
are
also
bound
by
the
automatic
stay.
where
we
draw
the
line
is
where
the
trustee
attempts
to
get
a
monetary
judgment
as
a
means
of
augmenting
the
estate,
which
is
what
is
happening
with
this
case.
mr.
william
e.
thro
the
automatic--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--yes,
your
honor.
the...
this
court's
decisions
have
struck
a
balance
between
respecting
the
need
for
the
states
to
obey
federal
law
and,
at
the
same
time,
respecting
the
constitutional
value
of
the
states'
sovereign
immunity.
what
we
have
here
in...
with
respect
to
the
automatic
stay
and
with
respect
to
the
discharge
decisions,
is
states
being
bound
by
federal
law,
no
different
than
the
states
being
bound
by
the
minimum
wage
law,
for
example.
but
what
we
have
with
respect
to
the
trustee's
attempts
to
augment
the
estate
by
collecting
a
monetary
judgment
against
the
states
is
an
attempt
to
invade
the
state
treasury,
which
this
court's
decisions
clearly
state
is
barred
by
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
william
e.
thro
sorry,
justice
breyer.
mr.
william
e.
thro
your
honor,
the
constitution...
specifically,
the
eleventh
amendment...
confirms
that
the
states
are
not
to
be
treated
like
private
parties.
private
parties
are
not
immune
from
contract
actions;
states
are.
private
parties
are
not
immune
from
torts...
from
tort
actions.
mr.
william
e.
thro
there
is
a
bankruptcy
clause,
your
honor,
and
that
clause
empowers
congress
to
make
bankruptcy
laws
which
apply
throughout
the
entire
nation
and
which
apply
to
the
states.
however,
the
bankruptcy
clause
does
not
authorize
congress
to
abrogate
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
from
suit.
when...
while
abrogation
can
be
accomplished
using
other
provisions,
it
cannot
be
accomplished
using
the
bankruptcy
provision.
mr.
william
e.
thro
yes,
your
honor.
and
this
court
said,
in
seminole
tribe,
that
the
article
1
powers
could
not
be
used
to
take
away,
or
to
abrogate,
the
states'
sovereign
immunity.
now,
obviously,
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
can
be
used
to
do
it,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
congress
used
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
enacting
its
attempt
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
william
e.
thro
i
think
there
is
a
strong
argument
which
can
be
made
that
both
the
automatic
stay
and
the
discharge
decisions
infringe
upon
state
sovereignty.
however,
this
court's
decisions,
dating
back
to
at
least
new
york
versus
irving
trust
in
1933,
have
made
it
clear
that
the
states
are
bound
by
the
provisions
of
the
discharge
orders.
i
think,
also,
the
automatic
stay
is
something
similar
to
the
ex
parte
young
doctrine,
in
terms
of
the
states
being
enjoined
from
doing
something
else.
however--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
thro
no,
there's
not,
your
honor.
what
we
have--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--certain--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--certainly,
this
court's
decisions
indicate
that,
in
some
instances,
there
can
be
in
rem
decisions
which--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--as
this
court
noted
in
hood,
the
bankruptcy
decisions
regarding
the
discharge
are
in
rem
and,
of
course,
are
binding
upon
the
state.
but
what
we
have
here
is
not
an
in
rem
proceeding.
as
this
court
noted
in
nordic
village,
an
action
to
recover
a
preferential
transfer
claim
is
not
an
in
rem
proceeding.
rather,
as
this
court
noted
in
schoenthal
versus
irving
trust
in
1932,
and
granfinanciera
versus
nordberg
in
1989,
actions
to
recover
preferential
transfer
are
much
like
actions
to
recover
a
contract
claim.
that
is,
like
a
contract
claim,
they
do
not
involve
the
core
bankruptcy
proceedings,
but,
rather,
involve
matters
that
are...
or
controversies
that
are
tangential
to
the
core
bankruptcy
proceedings.
they're
nothing
more
than
an
attempt
to
augment
the
state.
and
where
we
would
draw
the
line,
and
where
we
propose
that
this
court
draws...
draw
the
line...
and
a
line
that
we
believe
is
consistent
with
this
court's
previous
decisions...
is
that
the
states
are
bound
by
discharge,
the
states
are
subject
to
the
automatic
stay,
but
the
trustees'
attempts
to
obtain
monetary
judgments,
and
thereby
augment
the
value
of
the
estate,
are
barred
by
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
william
e.
thro
right.
conceptually,
it's
possible.
and
certainly
there
is
an
argument
that
the
bankruptcy
code
says
that
preferential
transfer
is,
in
fact,
property
of
the
state.
with
respect,
however,
to
a
preference
to
a
state,
we
would
say
that
that
particular
reading,
as
applied
to
the
state,
is
unconstitutional.
i
don't
believe
congress
can
make
a
law
which
would
require
the
state
to
divest
money
or
something
to
which
the
state
has
in
its
possession
in
which
the
state
has
a
colorable
claim
of
ownership.
here,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
money
is
in
the
state
treasury.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
recover
a
monetary
judgment
from
the
state.
as
this
court
said
in
schoenfeld
[sic]
and
in
granfinanciera,
this
is
very
much
like
a
contracts
claim.
mr.
william
e.
thro
the
current
bankruptcy
code
does
not
say
that.
in
theory,
i--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
just
as
the
contract
claims
are
barred,
so
are
the
preferential--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--transfer
claims.
mr.
william
e.
thro
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
william
e.
thro
congress
has
drawn
a
distinction
between
preferential
transfer
claims
and
contracts
claims.
however,
this
court
has
noted
that
the
difference
between
an
action
to
recover
a
contract
claim
in
order
to
augment
the
estate
and
an
action
to
recover
a
preferential
transfer
in
order
to
augment
the
estate,
that
there
really
is
no
difference.
both
are--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--i
think...
congress
has
certainly
defined
the
estate
so
that
a
preferential
transfer
is
considered
property.
i'm
not
sure
that
congress
can
do
that
when
the
preferential
transfer
involves
the
estate.
that
strikes
me
as
the
effect
of
congress,
in
effect,
saying
that
property
which
clearly
belongs
to
the
state
no
longer
does.
i
think
that's
probably
an
affront
to
tenth
amendment
federalism
concerns.
but
what
we
do
have
here
is
a
situation
where,
like
in
a
breach
of
contract
claim,
they
are
trying
to
recovery
a
monetary
judgment
in
order
to
augment
the
estate.
it's
our
position
that
that
is
barred
by
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
william
e.
thro
the
respondent
had
asked
the
bankruptcy
court...
after
reading
our
brief,
the
respondent
asked
the
bankruptcy
court
to
dismiss--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
an
attempt
by
the
respondent
to
rewrite
the
question
presented.
neither--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--our
petition--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--it
is
rather
odd,
your
honor,
but
my
read
of
this
court's
rules
are
that
there
is
no
mechanism
for
a
respondent,
the
party
that
won
below,
to,
in
effect,
give
up
its
victory
once
they
get
in
this
court.
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
they
wish
to
drop
the
breach
of
contract
claims.
perhaps
they
feel
that
by
dropping
the
breach
of
contract
claim,
they
somehow
obtain
a
tactical
advantage.
and,
if
that's
the
case,
certainly
this
court
should
not
allow
them
to
rewrite
the
question
presented
in
order
to
obtain
a
tactical
advantage.
but,
in
any
event,
both
the
breach
of
contract
claim
and
the
preferential
transfer
claims
are
attempts
to
augment
the
estate
and
are
barred
by
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
william
e.
thro
no.
the
waiver
argument
is
not
properly
before
you.
it
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
below.
moreover,
it
was,
for
the
most
part,
not
preserved
in
the
court
of
appeals
below.
while
they
did
argue
that
virginia
military
institute
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
all
claims
involving
virginia
military
institute
in
the
sixth
circuit,
they
made
no
such
argument
that
filing
proof
of
claim
constituted
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
the
transactions
involving
the
other
institutions.
mr.
william
e.
thro
i
believe
that
this
court's
decisions
indicate
the
following
position.
when
a
state
files
a
proof
of
claim,
it
exposes
itself
to
the
trustee's
defenses
to
that
claim.
so,
in
other
words,
if
the...
if
the...
if
the
preferential
transfer
was
part
of
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--different
claim.
mr.
william
e.
thro
then
i
believe
that
this
court's
opinions
indicate
that
that
would
not
be
a
waiver
with
respect
to
the
different
transaction
or
occurrence.
certainly,
by
filing
the
proof
of
claim
you
would
expose
yourself
to
the
trustee's
defenses
with
respect
to
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence.
mr.
william
e.
thro
to
the
extent
that
106(c)
goes
beyond
the
rule
announced
in
gardner,
then,
yes,
it
has
constitutional
problems.
but
you
need
not
reach
the
constitutionality
of
106(c).
what
we
were
talking
about
here
is
basically
a
straightforward
application
of
this
court's
precedence
in
a
line
that
you
have
drawn
in
other
contexts.
mr.
william
e.
thro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in...
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
what
effect
happens
when
a
sovereign
entity
initiates
litigation
indicate
that
the
sovereign,
by
initiating
litigation,
certainly
exposes
itself
to
defenses,
but
does
not
expose
itself
to
affirmative
recoveries.
mr.
william
e.
thro
yes,
your
honor.
and
to
the
extent
that
a
setoff
is
a
defense,
it
would
be
permitted.
but
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
hypothetical
that
you
were
talking
about,
a
setoff
which
involved
an
affirmative
recovery
against
the
state.
mr.
william
e.
thro
okay.
mr.
william
e.
thro
then
i
misunderstood
your
hypothetical.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
thro
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i...
although
this
court
has
recognized
certain
in
rem
exceptions
to
sovereign
immunity,
particularly
in
the
admiralty
context,
this
court
has
never
recognized...
said
that
sovereign
immunity
allows
a
federal
court
to
order
the
state
to
return
something
where,
number
one,
it's
in
the
state's
possession,
as
it
would
be
in
your
hypothetical,
and,
number
two,
the
state
has
at
least
a
colorable
claim
of
ownership,
which,
if
i
understood
your
hypothetical
correctly,
the
state
does
have
a
colorable
claim
of
ownership.
but
you
need
not
reach...
deal
with
the
intangible
or
personal
property
issues.
the
only
thing
that
is
at
issue
here
is
a
demand
for
a
monetary
judgment.
mr.
william
e.
thro
as
i
understand
this
court's
decisions
on
this,
if
the...
if
the
property
is
in
the
possession
of
the
state,
and
if
the
state
has
a
colorable
claim
to
ownership,
then
sovereign
immunity
will
bar
the...
a
court--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--a
federal
court
order
to--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--this
court
has
certainly
recognized
certain
in
rem
exceptions,
notably
in
the
treasure
salvors
case,
where
the
state
did
not
have
a
colorable
claim
to
title,
and
also
in
deep
sea
research,
where
the
state
did
not
have
possession
of
the
object.
also,
in
the
whiting
pools
case,
the
federal
government
had
possession
of
a
intangible
asset,
but
it
was
clear
that
the
debtor
still
had
the
ownership
interest,
and
this
court
said
that,
in
that
circumstance,
the
federal
court
would...
could
order
the
return.
mr.
william
e.
thro
right.
it
would
be
a
gross
in...
a
radical
in...
expansion
of
in
rem
jurisdiction.
traditionally--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--in
rem--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--traditionally,
in
rem
jurisdiction
has
a
couple
of
characteristics.
one
is,
it
is...
it
is
everyone
against
the
world.
it
binds--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--right.
mr.
william
e.
thro
and--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--right.
and
a
specific
performance
contract
action,
while
barred
in
federal
court,
would,
of
course,
be
allowed
in
state
court,
to
the
extent
that
virginia
has--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--right.
mr.
william
e.
thro
i
don't
believe
it
could
be
characterized
as
an
in
rem
action,
given
the
traditional
understandings
of
"in
rem".
but,
regardless
of
whether
you
call
it
"in
rem"
or
"in
personam",
sovereign
immunity
would
still
bar
such
a
thing
in
federal
court.
this
court
has
never
said
that
there
is
an
in
rem
exception
to
sovereign
immunity.
to
the
contrary,
you
explicitly
rejected
an
in
rem
exception
to
sovereign
immunity
in
nordic
village,
at
least
where
money
was
concerned.
you
have
allowed
recovery
in
certain
limited
circumstances,
such
as
the
admiralty
cases.
those
do
not
exist
here.
this
is
not
an
in
rem
proceeding.
preferential
transfer
is
not
an
in
rem
proceeding
under
nordic
village.
moreover,
as
this
court's
opinions
in
schoenthal
and
granfinanciera
make
clear,
it's
more...
it's
a
traditional
sort
of
common
law,
similar
to
a
contract
action.
mr.
william
e.
thro
i
believe--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--well,
i
believe
that
this
court's
decisions
in
the
bankruptcy
context
draw
the
line
with
respect
to
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence.
so,
to
the
extent
that
it
arises
out
of
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence,
then
you've
got
that,
sort
of,
partial
or
limited
waiver.
where--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--however,
with--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--there
is
an
offset.
i--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--right.
i
think
the
offset
obligation...
my
understanding
of
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
was
that
the...
was
that
we
were
talking
about
an
offset
that
would
not
be
an
affirmative
recovery,
but
would
merely
be
using
as...
an
offset
as
one
of
the
trustee's
defenses
to
the
claim.
mr.
william
e.
thro
against
the
entire
state.
mr.
william
e.

yes.
mr.
william
e.
thro
yes.
mr.
william

no.
mr.
william

particular...
with
respect
to
that
particular
transaction
or
occurrence,
not
to
the
other
transactions
or
occurrences.

there
is
no
way
that
you
can
lump
in
the
other
three
schools.
with
respect
to
vmi,
by
filing
a
proof
of
claim,
vmi
exposed
itself
to
the
trustee's
defenses.
to
the
extent
that
the
setoff
is
a
defense
for
the
trustee,
then,
of
course,
that
setoff
would
apply
to
vmi.
before
i
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
make
three
points.
first,
seminole
tribe
controls.
congress
may
not
use
its
article
1
bankruptcy
clause
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity.
second,
to
rule
in
favor
of
virginia
does
not
require
any
alterations
in
this
court's
jurisprudence;
however,
to
rule
for
mr.
katz
on
any
theory
requires
certain
fundamental
changes
in
this
court's
jurisprudence.
finally,
regardless
of
context,
sovereign
immunity
bars
monetary
judgment
claims.
states
are
immune
from
contract
actions;
private
parties

states

thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
thro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
congress
may
use
the
article
1
bankruptcy
clause
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity.
in
alden
versus
maine,
this
court
held
that
there
was
a
presumption
that
the
states
had
retained
their
immunity
unless
it
could
be
shown
by
conclusive
evidence
that
the
states
surrendered
their
immunity
in
the
plan
of
convention.
if
congress
can
use
the
article
1
bankruptcy
power
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity,
then
one
would
expect
there
to
be
discussions
to
that
effect
at
the
constitutional
convention,
in
the
federalist
and
antifederalist
writings,
and
in
the
ratifying
conventions.
yet,
as
the
sixth
circuit
conceded
in
its
version
of
hood,
there
is
no
compelling
evidence.
there
is,
at
best,
silence.
silence
cannot
equal
the
compelling
evidence.
therefore,
the
article
1
bankruptcy
power
cannot
be
used
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
william
e.
thro
yes,
you
could,
your
honor.
but
you
should
not
address
any
of
the
alternative
arguments
raised
by
mr.
katz.
mr.
william
e.
thro
well--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--yes,
absolutely,
your
honor--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
the
proper
exercise
of
judicial
restraint
is
to
decide
the
question
presented,
and
only
the
question
presented,
and
do
the
other
grounds
for
perhaps
another
day.
all
of
katz's...
all
of
katz's
novel
arguments
raise
complex
constitutional
issues
and,
quite
frankly,
ask
for
radical
alterations
of
this
court's
jurisprudence.
mr.
william
e.
thro
yes.
within...
i
think,
in
effect,
if
you
were
to
decide...
if
you
decided
that
the
convention
itself
had
intended--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--for
the
states
not
to
have
sovereign
immunity
in
bankruptcy,
then
you
would
conclude
that
the
article
1
bankruptcy
clause
includes
the
abrogation
power.
so,
i
think
it's,
sort
of,
two
sides
of
the
same
question.
returning
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
a
second
reason
for
not
addressing
katz's
arguments
were,
they
were
not
passed
on
below.
as
this
court
noted
in
granfinanciera,
where--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--yes.
yes.
mr.
william
e.
thro
yes,
absolutely.
you...
it...
you
can...
you
should
decide
the
question
presented.
and
if
you
decide
the
question
presented
in
our
favor...
that
is,
that
congress
has...
does
not
have
the
power
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity...
you
would
presumably
remand
to
the
sixth
circuit
for
further
proceedings,
consistent
with
your
opinion.
at
that
time,
katz
could
attempt
to
present
these
other
defenses.
we
would,
of
course,
argue
that
some
of
those
defenses
had
not
been
properly
preserved.
but
it
has
not
been
briefed
below.
mr.
william
e.
thro
thank
you.
