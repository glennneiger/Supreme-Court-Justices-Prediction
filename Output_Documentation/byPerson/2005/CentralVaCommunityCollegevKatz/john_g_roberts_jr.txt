chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
central
virginia
community
college
versus
katz.
mr.
thro.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
lewis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
the
same
problem
in
the
patent
area,
isn't
it?
and
yet,
in
the
florida
prepaid
cases,
we've
enforced
the
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
patent
proceedings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
waiver
argument
is...
is
it
under
106(b)
or
106(c)?
it's
beyond
both
of
those,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
abrogation,
that's
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--a
waiver.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
my
question
would
be,
how
can
you
argue
in
favor
of
waiver
when
you
have
a
statute
with
a
much
more
limited
waiver,
the
limits
in
106(b)
and
106(c),
and
you're
saying,
"well,
they
waived
it
much
more
broadly?
"
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
most
you
can
argue
is
that
there
was
a
waiver
under
106(b)
or
106(c),
but
that
doesn't
get
rid
of
the
whole
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
interpret
the
statute
to
establish
that
congress
intended
the
states
to
waive
their
immunity
with
the
filing
of
the
claim?
i
don't
see
that
anywhere
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
arguing
that
by
filing
the
claim,
the
state
has
waived
all
of
its
immunity,
but
i
don't
see
where
in
the
statute
it
imposes
that
kind
of
waiver
upon
states.
i
see
where
they
abrogate
the
immunity,
but
that's
different
than
saying
that
there's
a
waiver.
is
your
argument
that
just
because
they
abrogated
immunity,
and
it
turned
out
they
didn't...
may
or
may
not
have
that
authority,
they
necessarily
imposed
a
waiver?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
well,
then
where
is
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
this
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought...
you're
not
relying
on
106(b)
and
106(c).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
where
is
the
waiver
of
immunity
on
which
you're
relying?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
have
no
argument
that
congress
imposed
a
waiver.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
do
you...
how
do
you
have
an
informed
waiver
if
the
argument
is
over
the
authority
to
abrogate?
in
other
words,
the
federal
government
is
saying,
under
your
theory,
that
we're
abrogating
your
immunity.
and
the
state's
saying,
"you
don't
have
that
authority".
and
how
do
you
get
an
informed
waiver,
simply
because
the
state
participates
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
on
the
basis
of
the
legal
theory
that
they're
asserting
here
today,
that
congress
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
abrogate
the
immunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that.
but
your
theory,
as
i
read
in
your
brief,
as
an
alternative
argument,
is
that
there
was
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--waiver.
the
state
waived
its
immunity
by
participating
through...
in
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--bankruptcy
proceeding.
how
is
there
an
informed
waiver
if
the
argument
is
over
the
authority
to
abrogate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
all
the...
all
the
statute
does
is
abrogate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
106(a).
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--an
attempt
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--abrogate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
it
turns
out
that
congress
doesn't
have
that
authority,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
the
state
has
made
an
informed
waiver,
when
their
theory
is,
"guess
what?
"
"you
don't
have
that
authority
to
abrogate.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
we're...
i
think
it's
safe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
trick
they
play
on
new
chief
justices
all
the
time.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
even...
yeah,
we're
even
more
in
the
dark
now
than
before.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
to
what
extent
was
this
argument
raised
below,
i
guess
is
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so,
the...
so,
the
long
and
short
of
it
is,
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
you
did
not
make
the
same
waiver
below
that
you're
making
here
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
apologize
for
the
fireworks.
[laughter]
mr.
thro,
you
have
three
and
a
half
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
in
no.
04-885,
central
virginia
community
college
versus
katz;
it
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
