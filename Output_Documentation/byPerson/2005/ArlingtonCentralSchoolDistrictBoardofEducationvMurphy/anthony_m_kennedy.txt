justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
would
have
thought
that
your
answer
would
be
that
the
congress
was
interested
in
finding
out
the
cost
of
this
act,
and
it's
very
clear
that
school
districts
hire
consultants
to
assist
them
in...
in
these
cases,
and
it
wanted
to
know
the
amount
they
were
paying
to
the
consultants.
and
that's
also
why
it
used
the
word
personnel,
which...
which
is
a
word
usually
reserved
for
a
government
agency.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that
you
don't
have
a
further
answer
to
justice
stevens
because
there's
(3)(a)
and
(3)(b).
(3)(a)
talks
about
costs
and
expenses
awarded
to
the
prevailing
party.
(3)(b)
says,
for
the
same
sample
the
number
of
hours
spent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
we
have
said
that
conference
reports
are
more
valuable
than
the
reports
of
a
single
house.
i
think
we
have
said
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
gravamen--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
the
gravamen...
well,
i'll
let
you
finish
your
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
gravamen
of
the
argument...
is
it
that
this
phrase
is
unambiguous?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
casey...
casey
is
very
clear
in
saying
the
judicial
background
against
which
congress
enacted
1988,
talking
about
1988,
mirror
the
statutory
background,
and
it
says
the
judicial
background
was
that
expert
fees
were
quite
different
than
attorneys'
fees.
they
were
not
a
subset
of
attorneys'
fees.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
the
word
consultants
appears
in
subsection
(b)
of
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
specifically
refers
to
the
state
educational
agency
and
local
educational
agency.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
uses
personnel,
which
sounds
to
me
a
very
odd
way
to
talk
about
private
experts
hired
by
an
attorney.
you
don't
talk
about
them
as
personnel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
before
the
magna
carta
you're
asking
for
in
this
case
which
would
establish
a
whole...
a
whole--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--new
profession
of
experts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the...
did
the
final
bill
say
we
adopt
the
findings
of
the
conference
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
other
bills
have
said
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
like
in...
as
in
nofstiker.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
the
school
boards
have
some
consultants
and
experts
in
this
area
other
than
the
teachers?
