justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
gao
study
included
not
just
the...
the
hours
worked
and
the...
the
costs,
however
you
choose
to
define
it,
on
the
part
of
the
parent
challenging
the
school
board
action,
but
it
also
included
those
hours
and
those
costs
expended
by
the
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
it
could
not
possibly
have
been
directed
to
what
items
are
compensable.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
its
face,
it
covers
at
least
half
of
the
items
that
are
not
compensable.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
congress
say
that,
mr.
kuntz?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
language,
by
the
way...
i'm
not
clear.
it
always
cited
to
the
house...
the
house
conferees.
was...
was
this
language
in
the...
in
the
senate
conference
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
don't
really
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
only
half
of
the
congress,
isn't
it?
even
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
if
everybody
in
the
house
agreed
with
that,
which
we
don't
really
know.
what
about
the
president?
when
he
signed
it,
did...
did
he
indicate
any
interpretation?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
have
a
committee
of
one
house
that
said...
that
said
that,
that
thought
it
meant
that
or
would
have
liked
it
to
mean
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
voted
on
when
the...
when
the
conferees
make
changes,
which
they
sometimes
do.
then...
then,
of
course,
they
have
to
be
voted
on.
so
it's
frequent.
it's
frequent
that
they're
voted
on,
but
this
one
apparently...
there
were
no
changes
made
and
it
wasn't
voted
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
breyer
knows
that.
he...
he's
worked
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
even
in...
in
those
benighted
days,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
we
ever
would
use
the
conference
report
when
the
statute
was
not
ambiguous.
i
thought
it
was
always
a
rule
that...
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
past
casey,
casey
didn't
invent
this
as
a
definition.
casey
said
it
has
always
meant
this
in
innumerable
federal
statutes.
casey
was
relying
on
a
longstanding
practice
which
existed
long
before
casey
was...
was
pronounced.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
later
ascribe.
i
mean,
casey
was
relying
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
vladeck,
my...
my
problem
with
the
argument
you're
now
making
is...
is
a
little
more
basic.
assuming,
which
i
think
is
a...
is
a
major
assumption,
that
expenses
refers
to
expert
fees,
i
don't
see
how
it
helps
your
case
that
in
another
part
of
the
statute,
the
statute
says,
fees,
costs,
and
expenses,
whereas
in
the
operative
part
that
we're
talking
about
here,
it
only
refers
to
fees
as
part
of
costs.
how
does
it
help
your
case
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
elsewhere
they
go
out
of
their
way
to
add
and...
and
expenses?
it
seems
to
me
that
hurts
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
where
is
the
authorization?
i
think
that's
what
justice
alito's
question
goes
to.
you
have
to
come
up
with
some
statutory
authorization
to
pay
expert
fees.
now,
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
costs
does
not
authorize
any
costs.
it
just
says
whatever
costs
are
otherwise
authorized,
attorneys'
fees
will
be
part
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
authorization
to
pay
costs,
to
pay
those
costs
that
include
expert
fees?
all...
all
this
section
says
is
they
may
award
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
costs,
and
costs
are
presumably
elsewhere
authorized.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
where
is
the
authorization
to
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
state
that
doesn't
have
a
cost
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
effective
too,
as
though
it
were
written
into
the
statute,
because
one
committee
of
congress
said
so.
that's
effective.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
they
read
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
thing
we
know
for
sure
that
they
voted
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
was
this
legislation
vetoed
by
the
president?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
when
the
president
signed
it,
did...
did
he
also
approve
the
conference
report?
did
he
have
the
conference
report
in
front
of
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
the
statute
in
front
of
him,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
think
he
read
the
conference
report
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
date
in...
i
mean,
so
we
have
two
different
modes
of
interpreting
statutes,
one,
pre-1988
in
which
we
use
legislative
history,
and
one
post-1988
in
which
we
don't
use
legislative
history?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that...
that's
what
you're
suggesting,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
reason
one
does
not
use
legislative
history,
if
one
does
not
use
it,
as
i
don't...
as
i
don't,
is
not
because
congress
doesn't
expect
it
to
be
used,
but
because
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
delegate
to
one
of
its
committees
the
content
of...
of
its
statutes.
the
constitution
provides
that
legislation
will
be
passed
by
two
houses
and
signed
by
the
president,
and
the
problem
with
legislative
history,
for
those
of
us
who
have
a
problem
with
it,
is
this
amounts
to
a
delegation
by
congress.
it's
not
a
matter
of
what
congress
expected.
i
don't
care
what
congress
expected.
it
can't
do
it.
it
can't
leave
it
to
a...
to
a
committee
to...
to
fill
in
the
blanks
in
a
statute.
that's
the
problem,
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
expectations.
