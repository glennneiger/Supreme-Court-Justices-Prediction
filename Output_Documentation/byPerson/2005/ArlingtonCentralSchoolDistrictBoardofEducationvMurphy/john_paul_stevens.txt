john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
right
includes
any
costs
other
than
statutory
costs,
any
expenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
explain
the
reference
to
expenses
on
page
4
of
the
red
brief
which
quotes
from
the...
a
section
of
the
statute
authorizing
a
report
to
be
made,
a
report
authorized
under?
they
shall
include
data
about
the
specific
amount
of
attorneys'
fees,
costs,
and
expenses.
why
do
you
suppose
they
put
the
word
expenses
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
expenses
must
be
something
other
than
attorneys'
fees
or
costs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
the
provision
i
referred
to
refers
to
the
specific
amount
of
attorneys'
fees,
costs,
and
expenses
awarded
to
the
prevailing
party?
so
it's
definitely
referring
to
expenses
incurred
by
the...
by
the
plaintiff.
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
the
word
expenses
should
refer
only
to
expenses
incurred
by
counsel,
which
of
course
would
be
normally
reimbursable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
doubt
that
the
best
evidence
is
the
text
of
the
statute,
but
at
least
the
people
who
drafted
this,
even
if
they
were
not
the
conferees
themselves
but
were
just
staff
members,
they
apparently
thought
the
language
was
subject
to
that
reading.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
would
mean
it
would
be
ambiguous,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
rule
that
you
refer
to
that
you
cannot
look
at
legislative
history...
of
course,
we
always
start
with
the
plain
language.
that's
clear.
but
the
rule
that
you
cannot
look
at
legislative
history
didn't
really
get
any
emphasis
till
after
1987,
and
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1986.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
was
a
joint
explanatory
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
explain
the
title,
joint
explanatory
statement
of
the
committee
of
the
conference?
doesn't
that
speak
for
both
the
house
and
the
senate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
cite
an
example
of
a
conference
report
that
was
voted
on
by
the
congress?
justice
john
paul
stevens
language
in
the
statute
but
not
in
the
conference
report.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
a
conference
report
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
would
you
agree,
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
you
can
look
at
the
conference
report?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
answer
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
is
it
not
ambiguous
if
the
author
of
the
conference
report
read
it
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
at
the
time
they
did
that,
it
was
well
settled
in
cases
of
this
kind
that
the
court
would
look
at
the
conference
report
to
ascertain
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
at
that
time,
in
1986.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
any
case
that
said
you
can't
look
at
the
conference
report
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
best
evidence,
but
not
the
sole
evidence.
