mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
statute
awarding
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
the
costs
to
the
prevailing
parents
provides
a
clear
rule,
imposes
a
certain
obligation.
it
should
not
be
expanded
to
include
fees
for
expert
witnesses.
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
under
longstanding
rules,
statutes
are
construed
by
first
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute.
is
the
meaning
plain?
if
so,
the
inquiry
stops
there.
this
statute
is
unambiguous.
expert
fees
are
not
a
part
of
attorneys'
fees.
expert
fees
are
not
costs.
the
statute
contains
no
reference
to
expert
fees.
they
are
not
shifted
to
the
school
district
when
the
parents
prevail.
it's
our
belief
that
the
lack
of
compensation
for
experts
is
an
intentional
exclusion
and
omission
from
the
statute.
congress
knows
how
to
add
expert
fees
in
a
cost
shifting
statute,
and
that
omission
is
telling
here.
in
that
context,
i
think
it's
important
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
origin
of
the
statute.
it
was
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
smith
against
robinson.
at
the
time
that
smith
against
robinson
was
heard,
the
eha
was
often
grafted
onto
other
causes
of
action
as
a
pleading
device
to...
in
an
attempt
to
ensure
that
attorneys'
fees
flowed
to
the
prevailing
party
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case.
so
cases
were
brought
not
only
under
the...
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act,
but
also
under
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
and
under
1983
as
well
of...
on
the
theory
that
these
were
equal
protection
claims
brought
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
smith
against
robinson,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
the
avenue
that
had
to
be
followed
by
the
parents
was
exclusively
that
of...
of
the
remedy
provided
under
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act.
in
response
to
that
decision
of
the
court,
as
my
opponent
points
out
in
his
brief...
i
think
it
was
19
days
later...
bills
were
introduced
into
congress
to
remedy
what
congress
at
that
point
saw
was
a...
a
lack
of
coverage
for
fees
for
attorneys
for
the
prevailing
parties
in
cases
under
the...
under
the
act.
so
it's
no...
no
great
surprise
that
what
congress
did
in
that
instance
was
to
take
the
language
that
appears
in
section
1988
and,
in
effect,
lift
it
and
put
it
into
the...
into
the
act,
into
what
we
now
call
the
idea.
and
it's
very
clear
that
in
doing
so,
it
limited
the
right
of
recovery
to
attorneys'
fees,
and
that
right
does
not
include
the
expert
fees
advocated
by
the
respondents
here
this
morning.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
well,
it
said
attorneys'
fees,
costs,
and
expenses.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
and
it's
a
direction
to--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--well,
they
could
be
expenses
of
the
attorney.
but
if
they
were
to
be...
be
set
aside
separately,
that's
no
indication
that...
that
congress
intended
that
expenses
of
other
individuals
be
shifted
to
the
cost...
shifted,
rather,
to
the
school
district.
it's
a
direction
to
the
gao
to
acquire
data--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--for
future
reference
by...
by
congress.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
correct.
that's
in...
in
subdivision
(b).
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
there
are
two
subdivisions,
subdivision
(a)
and
subdivision
(b).
subdivision
(a)
says
attorneys'
fees,
costs,
and
expenses...
expenses,
and
in
subdivision
(b),
it
refers
to
consultants.
but
there
isn't
any--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--i...
i
believe
your
honor
is
correct
in
that
it...
it's
a
direction
by
the
gao
to
acquire
data.
and
i
believe
we
argued
that
point
in
our
brief,
just
as
your
honor
has
expressed
it.
we
think
that
that
direction
to
the
gao,
however,
does
not
relate
back
particularly
and...
and
certainly
doesn't
inform
this
court
or
inform
the
statute
that
expert's
fees
are
to
be
included
and
shifted
over
to
the...
to
the
school
district.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
under
this
statute.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
your
honor,
i
think
this
court
has
looked
at
that
issue
in...
in
two
separate
cases,
and
one
of
those
cases
is
crawford
fitting
and
the
other
is--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--well,
it
didn't
involve
this--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--your
honor,
it...
it
could,
but
i--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--but
we
come
back
to
the
historical
derivation
of
how
this
statute
came
into...
into
being,
and
it
did
come
in
in
response
to
smith
against
robinson.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
we
think
that's
a
separate
section.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
your
honor,
i...
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
but
i
think
there
are
expenses
that...
that
the
attorney
bears
in...
in
the
routine
of
a...
of
a...
of
handling
the
client.
those
are
expenses--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
they're
talking
about...
the
same
sample
refers
to
a...
a
designated
number
of
states,
a
representative
number
of
states.
so
the
sample
refers
to
the
states
surveyed,
not
to
those--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
so
much
a
question
of
metaphysics
or
philosophy...
maybe
perhaps
of
philosophy.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
no,
congress
didn't
say
that.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
your
honor,
if
i
might
respond
to
that.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
it's...
it's
a
longstanding
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
congress'
intent
is
best
found
in
the
language
that
congress
actually
puts
into
the
statute.
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
there
were
previous
versions
of
this
act
which
included
experts'
fees
which
did
not
make
its
way
to
the
final
version
approved
by
both
the...
the
senate
and
the
house.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--the
rule
that
we
look
first
to
the...
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
but
that...
in...
in
the
retrospective
view
that
the
court
looked
at
in...
in
the...
the
casey
decision,
it
went
back
and
it
traced
the
origin
of
a
number
of...
of
statutes
and
looked
essentially
to
similar
language,
and
it
found
that
experts'
fees
were
not
a
part
of
attorneys'
fees,
and
it
found
that
experts'
fees
were
not
a
part
of...
of
costs.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes,
your
honor,
and
to
us
that
proves
that
congress
knows
how
to
distinguish
between
experts'
fees
and
attorneys'
fees
when
it
wants
to.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
was.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
it
emanates...
it
emanates
solely
from
the
house
conference
report.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
his...
your
honor,
the...
the
president
hesitancy
was
about
the
retroactive
effect
of
the
statute,
and
he
noted
that
in
his
signing
memorandum,
but
he
didn't
note
any
other
differences.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
isn't
all
that
unusual
that
the
congressional
history
of
a
particular
statute
might
point
one
way
and
the
actual
plain
meaning
point
another
way.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
it...
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
it...
it
does
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
there
was
no
evidence
of
that,
your
honor,
in
our
review.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
i...
i
cannot,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i...
i
responded
as
i
did,
which
is
that
i
know
of
no
evidence.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
i...
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
thank
you,
your
honor.
shifting
the
costs
to
the
school
district
of
experts'
fees
will
also
shift
scarce
public
resources
away
from
the
point
where
it's
most
effective,
at
the
stage
when
the
parent
meets
with
the
iep
team
to
resolve
the
differences.
when
congress
has
revisited
this
statute,
as
it
has
since
1986,
time
and
time
and
again,
it's...
it's
spoken
to
the...
to
the
goal
of
reducing
litigation
and...
and
reducing
the
costs
associated
with
litigation.
if...
if
as
the
respondents
claim,
it's
central
to
the
fulfillment
of
this
statute
that...
that
congress
be
seen
to
have
shifted
the
costs
of
these
so
called
experts
to
the...
to
the
school
district
when...
when
they
fail,
i...
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
reality
is
that
the
school
district
has
no
staff
of
experts
as
the
respondents
intimate.
it
has
no
staff
of
consultants.
what
it
has
are
the
people
who
actually
provide
the
services
to
the
child,
and
when
they
come
to
testify
at
the
hearing,
typically
they're...
they're
scared
or
nervous
because
it's
the
first
time
that
they've
been
at
such
a
hearing.
they're
not
professional
experts.
they're
not
testimonial
experts.
those
are
the
kinds
of
experts
that
the
respondents
are
talking
about
and
asking
this
court
to
see
in
the
statute.
one
needs
to
ask
the
question
if
congress
really
intended
expert
fees
to
be
a
part
of
this
statute,
what
stayed
congress'
hand
from
writing
those
words
into
the
statute?
it's
very
clear
that
congress
knew
how
to
do
that
when
it
became
appropriate,
in
its
judgment,
for
it
to
do
that.
to
sort
of
see
it
here
lurking
in
the
shadows
in...
in
sort
of
the
backwaters
of...
of
the
act
and
to
intimate
from
there
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
has
meaning
that
needs
to
be
expanded
and
enlightened
by
the
congressional
report
doesn't
make
a
lot
of...
of
sense.
if...
if
it's
important,
it
should
have
been
there.
the...
its
absence
is
very,
very
telling.
and--
mr.
raymond
g.
kuntz
--typically
they
do
not,
your
honor.
the
typical
iep
team
meeting
has
the
school
psychologist
perhaps,
has
the...
the
teachers
of
the...
of
the
child.
those...
some
of
those
are
required
members.
it
has
the
parent
of
a
handicapped
child.
it
might
have
the...
the
service
providers
like
the
speech
pathologist.
and
when...
when
it
comes
to
a
trial,
comes
to
a
due
process
hearing,
those
are
the
folks
who
come
and
testify
as
to
what
they
know
about
the
child,
the
test
results
they
have.
there
are
no
typical
consultants
or
testimonial
experts
that
appear
for
the
school
district.
so
the...
the
central
part
of
this
statute,
its...
its
revolution,
where
it
brings
parents
of
children
who
are
disabled
into
contact
with
the...
with
the
school,
has
had
a
wonderful
effect
in
fulfilling
the
promise
of
this
statute.
energizing
the
litigation
aspect
of
this
by
transferring
those
costs
to
the
school
district
will...
will
take
away
and
will
detract
from
the...
the
true
meaning
of
the
statute,
which
was
to
build
a
partnership
between
the
parents
and
the
school
district,
not
to
let
it
dribble
off
into
litigation.
thank
you.
