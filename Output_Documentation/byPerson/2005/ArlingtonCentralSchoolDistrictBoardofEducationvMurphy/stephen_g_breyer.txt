justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
does
it
make
it
possible
to
read...
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
it
doesn't
say
to
do
that,
but
i
guess
you
could
read
it
to
do
that,
couldn't
you?
i
mean,
you
said
the
word
cost
wasn't
ambiguous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
you
might
be
right,
maybe
absolutely,
but
might
you
also
be
wrong?
how
is
it
not
ambiguous?
it
might
cover...
it
might
cover
the
fees
of
consultants.
it
might
be
that
the
argument
you
made
is
right,
but
it
also
mightn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
involved
this
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
i
mean,
we
have
a
statute
and
they're
using
the
word
costs
in
the
statute,
and
whatever
they
used
in
some
other
statute
they
might
have
meant
something
different
in
this
statute.
and
my
question
is
simply
how
do
we
know
they
didn't
by
just
reading
the
word
five
times,
particularly
since,
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
another
part
of
the
statute,
they
do
seem
to
use
the
word
cost
to
include
number
of
hours
spent
by
personnel,
including
consultants,
and
the
expenses
incurred.
i
mean,
can
you
say...
is
there
a
dictionary
that
says
the
word
costs
couldn't
include
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
once
you
say
it
could,
then
possibly
it's
reasonable
to
ask
what
the
congress
members
were
actually
thinking,
and
as
soon
as
we
look
at
what
they
were
actually
thinking,
that's
perfectly
clear.
isn't
it?
because
both
the
conference
report
and
the
senate
report
say
absolutely
clearly
that
they
intended
this
kind
of
expense
to
be
used,
which
is
why
the
gao
went
out
and
did
all
the
studies
to
include
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
true,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
certainly
possible.
i
just
wonder
why
don't
we
look
and
see
what
they
intended,
since
they
told
us.
in
the
conference
report,
they
say
the
conferees
intend
the
phrase,
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
costs,
to
include
reasonable
expenses
and
fees
of
expert
witnesses
and
the
reasonable
cost
of
any
test
or
evaluation
which
is
found
to
be
necessary
for
the
preparation
of
a
parent
or
guardian's
case
in
the
action
or
proceeding.
so
why
are
we
metaphysically
trying
to
guess
what
congress
intended
when
they
told
us
what
they
intended?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is
why
don't
we
just
look
and
see
what
they
intended
since
they
wrote
it
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
read
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
did.
i
thought
that
the
conferees
in
congress
wrote
in
the
conference
report
precisely
what
they
intended.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i'd
like
you
to
respond
to
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
not
correct
it's
just
for
one
house.
it's...
what
i
have
is
the
joint
explanatory
committee,
and
it
says
the
managers,
on
the
part
of
the
house
and
the
senate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
is
there
some
rule...
i
don't
know
what
this
rule
is
you
can't
refer
to
legislative
history.
does
it
say
that
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
and
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
ones
are
voted
on?
i've
not
heard
of
that.
i
mean,
they
might
be,
but
it
used
to
be
that
the...
they
circulate
the
report
to
all
the
members
and
the
members
read
it,
and
if
a
member
disagrees
with
it,
they
note
their
dissent.
maybe
it's
changed.
but
i
guess--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
work
for
a
senator
who,
in
fact,
to
my
experience
asked
me
to
report
on
a
vote
on
such
a
thing.
i
just
wasn't
aware
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
one
thing
here--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
of
course--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
can't
use
red
if
the
statute
says
green.
green
doesn't
include
red.
i
understand
that.
and
that's
why,
in
fact,
i
wondered
if
the
presence
in
this
bill
of
the
gao
section
suggests
in
the
bill
itself
the
possibility
that
the
word
cost
means
something
special.
and
if
that's
so,
then
i
would
think
it
is
ambiguous
enough
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history.
it's
not
like
using
the
word
red
and
arguing
it
includes
green.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
read
the
phrase
from
the
conference
report
as
a
limitation?
that
is,
that...
we're
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
congress
meant
by
the
phrase
costs.
it
says
it
means
includes
reasonable
expense
and
fees
of
expert
witnesses
and
reasonable
costs
of
any
test
or
evaluation
that's
necessary.
so
then
is
that...
have
the
courts
read
that
as
a...
as
a
limitation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
any
opposition?
was
there
any...
is
there
any
history
of
anyone
in
this
senate
or
the
house
either
before
or
after
suggesting
that
they
didn't
want
to
allow
recovery
for
the
expert
fees?
