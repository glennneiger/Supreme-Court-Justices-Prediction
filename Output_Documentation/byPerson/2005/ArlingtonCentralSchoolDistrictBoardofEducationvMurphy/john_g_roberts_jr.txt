chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
in
arlington
central
school
district
board
of
education
v.
murphy.
mr.
kuntz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
sometimes
these
joint
statements
are
actually
voted
on
by
the
congress
as
a
whole.
was
this
one...
was
this
one
voted
on?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
salmons.
you
have
examples
of
conference
reports
being
voted
on,
don't
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
salmons.
mr.
vladeck.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
vladeck,
let
me
just
give
you
a
purely
hypothetical
situation.
let's
suppose
that
the
conferees
can't
agree
whether
expert
fees
should
be
included.
some
think
they
should;
some
think
they
shouldn't.
and
somebody
suggests
a
compromise.
the
compromise
is
we
won't
put
it
in
the
statute,
but
we'll
put
it
in
the
report
and
we'll
let
the
courts
figure
it
out.
what
should
happen
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
if
that's
not
this
case,
what
in
the
world
prevented
the
conferees
from
putting
something
as
important
in
this
context
as
expert
fees,
as
i
understand
it,
probably
more
important
than
attorneys'
fees...
what
prevented
them
from
putting
that
in
the
statute
if
that
clearly
was
their
intent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
going
to
say
it
certainly
had
the
meaning
in
federal...
the
federal
court
context
set
forth
in
section
1920
of
the
judicial
code.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that
set
forth?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
if
you
conclude
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
what
do
you
do
with
the
spending
clause
problem?
we've
said
that
when
you're
imposing
conditions
in
spending
clause
legislation,
you
have
to
do
that
unambiguously.
it's
what
the
court
said
in...
in
pennhurst.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it's
ambiguous,
if
the
availability
of
expert
fees,
which
is
the
big
ticket
item
in
these
things,
not
the
attorneys'
fees,
states
are
not
unambiguously
on
notice
that
they're
accepting
that
liability
when
they
take
the
funds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
even
if
it
is
not
the
big
ticket
item--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
still
has
to
be...
it
still
has
to
be
unambiguously
set
forth
in
spending
clause
legislation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
were
the
earlier
versions
that
included
that
expressly
then
not...
why
didn't
they
make
it
through
to
the
final
version?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
we've
slid
back
from
the
joint
statement
to
the
statement
of
one
member
on
the
floor
now.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
i
could
interrupt
you.
as
i
understood
it,
this
gets
back
to
where
you
started.
your
position
is
that
if
this
same
scenario
had
taken
place
in
1988
as
opposed
to
1986,
that
your
position
would
not
be
the
same.
in
other
words,
you
said...
your
suggestion
was
that
it
was
the
legal
context
at
the
time
in
'86
that
governed
what
congress
thought
the
effectiveness
of
its
statements
in
committee
reports
would
be.
maybe
i'm
ascribing
one
of
the
justice's
views
to
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kuntz,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kuntz.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
in
05-18,
arlington
central
school
district
board
of
education
versus
murphy.
