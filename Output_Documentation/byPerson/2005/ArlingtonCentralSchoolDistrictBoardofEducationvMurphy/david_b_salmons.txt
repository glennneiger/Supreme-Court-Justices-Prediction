mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i...
i
do
not
dispute
the
representations
that
have
been
made
about
that
practice.
but
let
me
begin
by
saying,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
court
should
give
the
attorneys'
fee
provision
of
idea
the
same
construction
it
gave
the
nearly
identical
language
of
section
1988
in
casey
and
hold
that
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
the
cost
does
not
include
expert
fees.
respondent's
sole
argument
is
that
expert
fees
are
included
in
the
statutory
term
costs,
but
as
this
court
made
clear
in
both
casey
and
crawford
fitting,
the
term
costs
in
a
fee
shifting
statute
has
a
well
settled
meaning
and
is
a
reference
and
is
limited
to
those...
that
modest
category
of
costs
that
may
be
awarded
under
28
u.s.c.
1920
and
1821.
now--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no.
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
now,
first
of
all,
just
to
be
clear,
the...
the
fee
provision
that's
at
issue
here
is
identical
to
the
fee
provision
that
was
at
issue
in
casey,
and
it
makes
no
reference
to
expenses.
it
says
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
the
costs.
now,
in
this
separate
section
instructing
the
gao
to
do
a
report--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--it
says
to
look
at
the...
the
awards
in
cases,
the
awards
of
attorneys'
fees,
costs,
and
expenses.
we
don't
think
the
term
expenses
in...
in
that
provision
can
fairly
be
read
to
somehow
dramatically
expand
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
the
costs.
we
think
it's
much
more
naturally
to
read
that
as
just
a
reference,
as
this
court
noted
in
casey,
to
the
common
practice
of
including
out
of
pocket
expenses
of
attorneys
for
things
like
copying
costs
and...
and
necessary
travel
expenses
and
things
like
that
as...
as
also
being
compensable.
and
so
we
don't
think
that
that...
that
term
expenses
does
anything
dramatically
to
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
provision
at
issue
here.
and
as
far
as
subsection
(b)
of
that
provision
related
to
the
gao,
we
think
it's
clear
that
it's
no
longer
referring
to
the
actual
awards
in
cases,
and
is
instructing
the
gao
to
do
a
broader
study
about
the
time
that's
spent
by
attorneys
and
consultants
and
others
on
both
sides
in
these
cases
because
congress
was
very
concerned
about
the
amount
of
litigation
and
the
expense
of
that
litigation
and
the
diversion
of
funds
away
from
the
core
educational
services
of
the
schools.
as
this
court
noted
in
schaffer,
that's
one
of
the
primary
concerns
congress
has
had,
especially
in
the
more
recent
amendments
to
the
act.
and
we
think,
in
fact,
that
the...
the
fact
that
congress
instructed
the
gao
to
study
that
is,
if
anything,
more
consistent
with
the
idea
that
congress
decided
not
to
legislate
on
the
question
of
expert
fees,
but
to
leave
it
for
another
day
after
they've
had
the
benefit
of
that
study
at
a
minimum.
now--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that...
that
is
correct.
during
the
administrative
proceeding
and
in
the...
and
in
the
district
court,
there
was
no
attorney
here.
but...
but
i
think
there's
one
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
about
that
is
that
that's...
congress
expected
that
that
would
be
the
result.
this
is
not
a
statute
where
congress
didn't
think
about
the
role
of
experts.
among
other
things,
section--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--sure.
well,
i
think
the
conference
report
clearly
represents
the
view
of
the
author
of
the
conference
report
with
regard
to
the
meaning
of
the
language.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
what
that
points
to
is
the
perils
of...
of
using
committee
reports
and
statements--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--from
the
legislative
history
when
the
text
is
clear.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
let
me
try
to
explain
why.
first
of
all,
this
court
made
clear
in
casey,
dealing
with
the
exact
same
language,
it
took...
you
know,
that's
at
issue
here--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no.
that's
right.
and
i'm
referring
to
the
statutory
language
here,
that
this
court
considered
this
exact--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
but
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
what
this
court
said--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes.
if
the
court
thinks
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
it's
fair
to
look
at
the
conference
report.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
for,
among
other
reasons,
your
honor...
this
is
what
i
was
trying
to...
trying
to
state
because
this
court
in
casey,
dealing
with
this
exact
same
language,
said
the
following.
it
said
where
the
statute
contains
a
phrase
that
is
unambiguous,
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
the
cost,
that
has
a
clearly
accepted
meaning
in
both
legislative
and
judicial
practices...
again,
this
court
in
casey
tracked
through
the...
the
usage,
the
history
of
the
usage
of
this
language
and
the
way
courts
had
responded
to
this
over
time...
that
when
that's
the
case,
we
do
not
permit
it
to
be
expanded
or
contracted
by
the
statements
of
individual
legislators
or
committees
during
the
course
of
the
enactment
process.
we
think
that
holding
in
casey
is
equally
applicable
here--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--and
it
be
would
wrong
to
look
to
that.
now,
if
the
court
did,
i
think
the
thing
that
the
court
should
take
away
from
it,
if
you're
going
to
look
at
what
congress
intended
here...
and
this
is
undisputably
true.
everyone
agrees
on
this.
the
primary
purpose
of
this
legislation
was
to
respond
to
this
court's
decision
in
smith
v.
robinson.
and
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
smith,
section
1988
had
provided
the
means
by
which
courts
had
awarded
attorneys'
fees
in
cases
under
idea's
predecessor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
smith
foreclosed
those
fees--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--sure.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that...
that
is
certainly
our
first
argument,
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
point
i'm
making
now
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
context
in
which
this
language
was
used,
smith
foreclosed
the
award
of
section
1988
fees.
congress
responded
shortly
thereafter
by...
by
adding
the
precise
language
of
section
1988
to
the
language
in
idea's
predecessor.
now,
however
anomalous
it
would
normally
be
to
give
the
same
language
in
two
different
fee
provisions
different
meanings...
and
it
would
be
quite
anomalous...
to
do
so
here
with
section--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
i
think--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--there
are
plenty
of
cases,
your
honor,
that...
that
point
out--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
the...
that...
that
point
out,
even...
even
i
think
beforehand,
that
the
language
is
the
primary
basis
to
look.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and
that
even
when
it's
unambiguous,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
we
certainly
agree
with
that,
and
i
would
just
add
that
i'm
not
aware
of
any
decision
of
this
court
that
would
suggest
that
the
type
of
statutory
construction
tools
the
court
would
use
would
depend
on
what
was
in
place
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
mean,
this
court
applies
the
rules
that
it
thinks
are
appropriate
at
the
time
it
issues
its
decision.
now--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--two
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
we
don't
think
it's
ambiguous
at
all,
and
we
think
when...
even
if
you
look
at
the
gao
provision,
you
don't
get
the
kind
of
ambiguity
that
would
allow
you
to
otherwise
deviate
from
the...
the
clear
meaning
of
this
language
when
it's...
when
it's
been
consistent
with
statutory
usage
over
time.
as
this
court
noted
in
casey,
more
than
34
statutes
use...
expressly
state
attorneys'
fees
in
addition
to
expert...
expert
fees
in
addition
to
attorneys'
fees,
and
there
would
be
no
point
to
those.
but...
but
moreover,
i
think
the
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
it's
not
just
this
fee
provision.
if
you
want
a
further
indication
of
congress'
intent,
let
me
refer
you
to
some
other
provisions
of
the
statute
itself,
again,
the
language
of
the
statute.
among
other
things,
section
1415(d)(2)
expressly
details
the
content
of
the
notice
that
has
to
be
given
to
the
parents
about
the
procedural
safeguards
in
the
act,
and
it's
very
specific.
it
lists
13
different
things
that
states
have
to
explain
in
full
to
the
parents.
the...
the
12th
and
the
13th
items
on
that
list
are
the
parents'
ability
to
bring
a
civil
action
and
their
right
to
bring,
quote,
attorneys'
fees,
no
mention
whatsoever
of
expert
fees.
thank
you,
your
honors.
