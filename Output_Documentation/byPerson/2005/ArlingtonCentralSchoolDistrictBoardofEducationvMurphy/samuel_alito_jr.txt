as
you--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--under
your
reading
of
1415,
may
a
court
award
to
parents
any
costs
that
they
incur
in
connection
with
the
litigation,
or...
or
would
you
just
add
expert
fees
to
the
attorneys'
fees?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
costs
is
not
a
term...
is
not
a
legal
term
of
art,
if
it
really...
if
it
means
just
the
expenses
that
parents
incur,
why
wouldn't
it
include
things
like
travel
expenses
or
lost
wages
to
attend
the
court
proceeding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
speaking
of
that...
of
that
language,
that
attorneys'
fees
may
be
awarded
as
part
of
costs,
does
that
suggest...
it
doesn't
say
directly
that
costs
may
be
awarded.
does
that
suggest
that
the
attorneys'
fees
are
simply
to
be
regarded
as
another
element
of
costs
that...
that
may
be
awarded
under
the
costs
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
untied
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit.
respondents
prevailed
in
an
action
on
behalf
of
their
son
under
the
individuals
with
disabilities
education
act,
or
idea.
they
then
sought
reimbursement
for
expert
fees.
the
district
court
granted
their
request
in
part,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
noting
two
of
our
decisions,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
a
fee-shifting
provision
will
not
be
read
to
permit
the
recovery
of
expert
fees
without,
“explicit
statutory
authority
indicating
that
congress
intended
for
that
sort
of
fee-shifting”.
ultimately,
though,
the
court
of
appeals
was
persuaded
by
a
conference
committee
report
and
concluded
that
the
idea
authorized
the
award
of
expert
fees.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
our
decision
is
guided
by
the
fact
that
congress
enacted
the
idea
pursuant
to
the
spending
clause.
although
congress
has
broad
power
to
set
the
terms
on
which
it
disperses
federal
money
to
the
states,
those
conditions
must
be
set
out
unambiguously.
the
text
of
the
idea
provides
that,
“in
any
action
or
proceeding
brought
under
this
section,
the
court
in
its
discursion
may
award
reasonable
attorneys’
fees
as
part
of
the
costs
to
the
parents
of
a
child
with
a
disability
who
is
the
prevailing
party”.
while
the
act
provides
for
an
award
of
reasonable
attorneys’
fees,
it
does
not
even
hint
that
acceptance
of
idea
funds
makes
the
state
responsible
for
reimbursing
expert
fees.
other
provisions
of
the
idea
point
in
the
same
direction,
and
apart
from
the
text,
perhaps
the
strongest
support
for
our
interpretation
is
supplied
by
our
decisions
in
the
two
cases
i
mentioned
previously,
crawford
fitting
company
versus
j.
t.
gibbons,
inc.,
and
west
virginia
university
hospitals
v.
casey.
the
reasoning
of
crawford
fitting
strongly
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
term
“costs”
here
is
defined
by
the
categories
of
expenses
enumerated
in
the
cost
statute,
28
usc
section
1920,
which
is
strictly
limited
by
section
1821;
and
in
casey,
we
interpreted
language
in
a
fee-shifting
provision
that
was
virtually
identical
to
the
language
here
and
concluded
that
it
did
not
authorize
the
award
of
expert
fees.
moreover,
the
court
of
appeals’
reliance
on
a
footnote
in
west
virginia
university
hospital
v.
casey,
which
commented
on
the
conference
committee
report,
suggesting
that
the
idea
provision
here
contemplated
reimbursement
for
exert
fees,
is
misplaced.
the
footnote
did
not
state
that
the
conference
committee
report
set
out
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
provision
here,
much
less
that
the
report
was
sufficient,
despite
the
language
of
the
statute
to
provide
the
clear
notice
required.
