justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about...
may
i
just
take
the
question
one
step
further?
i
think
it's
in
a
subsequent
clause
in
that
same
section
requiring
the
gao
report
that
it
refers
to
the...
the...
i
forget
whether...
the
expenses
of
consultants.
why
was
the
word
consultant
in
there?
because
as...
as
i
understand
it,
a
consultant
would
not
be
covered
by
the
costs...
the
general
costs
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
do
you
say
about
expenses?
isn't...
isn't
it
a
fairly
common
practice
for
a...
a
trial
lawyer
to...
to
hire
his
experts
and
pay
them
and
then
bill
the
client
for...
for
whatever
he's
paid
for
the
experts?
i
mean,
if
that
is
the...
this
has
been
a
long
time
since
i've
practiced
law.
so
maybe
that
isn't
the
way
it's
done
anymore.
but
it...
it
certainly
has
been
done
that
way,
and...
and
if
that
is
still
the
practice,
wouldn't
it
sense
for
congress
to
have
assumed
that
expenses
would
include
those
kinds
of
expenses?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
the
gao
reference.
you're
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you...
what
do
you
say
about
the
legislative
history,
which
has
been
so
prominent
in
the
discussion
this
morning?
the
conference
report.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
don't
you
suppose
it
represents
the
view
of
the
house
and
senate
conferees?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i...
i
realize
that,
but
i
mean,
an--
justice
david
h.
souter
--an
argument,
a
perfectly
fair
argument,
can
be
made,
whether...
whether
you
find
it
dispositive
or
not,
that
everything
that
goes
into
a
committee
report
of
one
house
cannot
simply
be
taken
as
a
literal
reflection
of
the
thinking...
the...
the
actual
thinking
of...
of
everybody
on
that
committee,
let
alone
a
whole
house.
but
when
we're
talking
about
a
conference
report
that
has
been
hammered
out
between
two
sets
of
conferees,
i
think
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
conferees
know
exactly
what
is
in
that
report
and
would
take
exception
to
it
if
it
didn't
represent
their
views.
isn't...
isn't
that
a...
a
fair
reason
for
saying
that
whatever
you
may
think
of
reports
in
general,
the
conference
report
probably
has
a...
a
superior
authority?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't...
isn't
it
really
the
point
not
that
it
makes
no
sense,
but
that
it
raises
a
question?
it
creates
the
question,
which...
which
we
have
in
mind
when
we
say
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
and
it
is
in
answering
that
question,
that
you
then
turn
to
the
legislative
history,
which
has
a
pretty
unequivocal
statement
in
your
favor.
isn't...
isn't
that
the...
the
way
to
analyze
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
under
that
reading,
wouldn't...
wouldn't
you
have
a
problem
in
a
state
court?
because
doesn't
this
same
provision
govern
in
a
state
court,
so
that
if
the
state
did
not
have
a
separate
cost
statute,
it
would...
it
would
authorize
nothing.
isn't...
isn't
that
the
problem
you'd
run
into.
