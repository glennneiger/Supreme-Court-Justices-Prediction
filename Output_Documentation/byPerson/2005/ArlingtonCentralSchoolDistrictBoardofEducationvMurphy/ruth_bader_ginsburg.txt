ruth
bader

is
it?
i
thought
the...
there
was
a
reference
to
hours
of
consultants,
but
not
expenses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
also
found
that
there
were
dozens
of
statutes,
i
think...
didn't
justice
scalia
list
in
his
opinion
for...
it
went
on
for
a
couple
of
pages,
including
footnotes?
i
think
it
was
over
30
that
did
mention
experts.
it
mentioned
attorneys'
fees
and
expert
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
salmons,
there's
one
difference,
a
marked
difference,
between
this
statute
and
the
others,
and
that
is,
in...
in
many
of
these
cases,
it
is
the
consultant
that
is
the
primary,
perhaps
exclusive,
aide
to
the
parent.
there's
not
a
case
where
they
have
these
determinations,
a
lawyer
is
in
the
front
line.
even
in
this
very
case,
wasn't
it
true
that
it
was
the
consultant
who
was
the
aide
to
the
parent
and
there
was
no
lawyer
on
the
scene?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
vladeck,
why...
if
that
was
what
congress
had
in
mind,
then
how
do
you
explain
the
multiple
statutes
that
are
listed
in
casey
that
say,
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
witness
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what...
mr.
vladeck,
may
i
stop
you
there?
because
the
parents
are
always
the
plaintiff.
it's
not
the
child.
the
parents
are
representing
the
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
prevailing
party
is
identical
to
parents.
the
parents
are
the
ones
who
prevail.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
testing?
isn't
testing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
vladeck,
you
have...
you
referred
to
the
section
on
gao
reporting--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
an
assist
to
help
you
include
consultant
fees
in...
in
costs.
but
how
do
you
explain
the...
the
provision
in
this
very
statute
that
says
attorneys'
fees
can
be
reduced?
congress
explicitly
provided
that
you
could
reduce
attorneys'
fees...
this
is
in
1415(i)(3)(f)...
and
not
one
word
about
reducing
the
costs
of
testing
fees
or
consulting
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why...
then
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
have
done
that
for
attorneys'
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not...
if
the
parents
make
a
reasonable
effort,
but
they
lose,
it's
not
going
to
be
free.
i
mean,
the...
the
statute
gives
them--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
right
to
oppose
the
school
board's
choice,
and
if
what
you
say
about
making
it
easier
on
parents
of
limited
resources,
they're
told
it's
going
to
be
a
gamble
if
you
lose,
you
don't
get
your
fees.
