mr.
david
c.
vladeck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
murphys'
principal
submission
in
this
case
is
that
the
text
of
idea
authorizes
courts
to
award
prevailing
parents
the
costs
of
the
experts
who
assist
them
in
idea
hearings
which
are
typically
held
before
state
administrative
tribunals
and
in
federal
court.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
thank
you
so
much,
your
honor.
i
think...
i
think
that
if
the
statutory
text
was
clear,
which...
and
i
believe
this
text
is
clear
in
the
other
direction...
i
think
we
would
lose
that
case.
but
that
is
not
this
case,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
why.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
without
being
flippant,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
conferees
thought
they
had
put
it
in
the
statute.
remember,
this
statute
was
passed
back
in
1986
when,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
99th
congress
that
enacted
this
provision,
the
word
cost
did
not
have
the
term
of
art
meaning
that
was
later
ascribed
to
it
in
this
court's
opinion
in
casey.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
congress
thought
it
was
adding...
that
use
of
the
word
cost
and
its
breadth
was
a
way
of...
of
including
the
cost.
and...
and
this
is
important,
your
honor.
the
language--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--your
honor,
at
the
time
casey
was...
at
the
time
this
case
was...
excuse
me...
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted
by
congress,
for
example,
costs
were
routinely
read
to
include
expert
fees
in
title
vii
cases,
for
example.
so
i
don't
disagree
with
your
honor's
point.
i
am
simply
saying
that
the
lens
through
which
this
statute
must
be
judged
is
the
understanding
of
the
99th
congress,
and
every
indication
in
the
legislative
history
here
is
that
congress
used
the
word
cost
for
its
breadth,
not
as
a
term
of
art.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
my
only
explanation,
your
honor,
is
that
the...
the
members
of
congress
who
wrote
this
provision
were
unaware
of
the
difference
this
court
would
later
ascribe
to
those
statutes
in
casey.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
even...
even
conceding
all
of
that,
which
i...
i
think
is...
let
me
take
a
step
back.
even
if
you
reject
that
submission,
the
next
provision
of
the
statute
on
which
we
rely
is
section
4
of
the
handicapped
children's
protection
act,
which
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
as
section
1415(i)(3)(b),
and
if
you
look
at
that
provision,
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
the
word
cost
to
have
a
broader
meaning.
section
4(b)(a)
directs
the
general
accounting
office
to
study--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--i'm
sorry?
that's
page...
excuse
me.
page
4
of
the
red
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that
directs
the
general
accounting
office,
first,
to
study
the
amount
of
attorneys'
fees,
costs,
and
expenses
awarded
to
the
prevailing
party.
in
this
statute,
only
the
parents
could
be
the
awarding...
the
prevailing
party
because,
unlike
1988,
this
statute
is
a
one
way
street
and
provides
only
for
awards
to
parents.
and
secondly,
it
says
that
for...
for
the--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
exactly
my
point,
your
honor.
and...
and--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--right,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
your
honor--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
your
honor,
this
provision,
up
until
the
last
part
which
says,
and
expenses
incurred
by
the
parents,
the...
the
last
clause
of
this
provision
was
added
in
conference.
and
the
conference
report
makes
that
clear
at
page
7.
the
conference
report
makes
it
clear
that
the
house...
the
senate
recedes
to
the
house
bill.
the
gao
study
provision
was
only
in
the
house
bill,
with
an
amendment
expanding
the
data
collection
requirements
of
the
gao
study
to
include
information
recording
the
amount
of
funds
expended
by
local
educational
agencies
and
state
education
agencies
on
civil
actions
and
administrative
proceedings.
that
clause
was
added,
your
honor,
in
conference.
prior
to
the
conference,
the
provision
was
very
much
the
same
as
it
is
today.
so--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--your
honor--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
an
inoperative
part
of
the
statute.
i
believe
that...
that...
this
direction
to
gao
makes
no
sense
if
all
congress
sought
to
authorize
was
attorneys'
fees
and
the
costs
that
are
historically
available
under
section
1920
and
section
1821.
this
provision
makes
no
sense.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i...
it
certainly
can
be
read
that
way.
i
read
it
as
more
of
an
affirmative
statement
by
congress--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
with
all
respect,
let
me
quarrel
with
one
of
the
premises
in
your
question,
which
is
that
the...
the
expenses
for
experts
are,
quote,
a
big
ticket
item.
if
you
look
at
page
28,
footnote
17
of
our
brief,
we've
tried
to
compile
all
of
the
reported
cases
on
the
amount
of
expert
fees
that
are
awarded.
they
tend
to
be
exceedingly
modest,
your
honor.
they
run
from
a
few
hundred
dollars
to
a
few
thousand
dollars.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
your
honor--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--your
honor,
that
is
not
the
case.
the...
the
rule
that
we
seek
to
preserve
has
been
the
way
courts
have
interpreted
this
provision
since
1988.
that's--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--so...
so
these
are
modest.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
right.
and...
and
if
the
court
finds
that
the
legislative
history
adds
the
clarity
that
the
statute
otherwise
needed...
is
needed,
i
do
not
see
why
that
would
not
comply
with
the
spending
clause,
particularly
since,
your
honor,
this
statute
has
been
on
the
book
for
20
years.
there
are
dozens
of
opinions
finding
that
expert
fees
are
compensable.
no
spending
clause
argument
has
ever
been
raised
in
this
kind
of
issue
even
though
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books
for
20
years.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
your
honor,
there
is
a
body
of
law
on
that
issue
that
already
exists
because
courts
have
interpreted
this
provision
since
1986.
by
and
large,
the
costs
that
have
been
awarded
under
the
statute
are
costs
that
are
normally
associated
with
litigation,
copying
costs,
computer
assisted
research
when
there's
a
lawyer
involved.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
the
cost
of
testing
and
evaluation,
which
is...
which
is
a
crucial
component
of
the
statute...
those
costs
have
been
awarded.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
the...
the
way
the
courts
have
addressed
that
issue,
your
honor,
is
they...
they
have
looked
to
the...
the
initial
phrase
of
the
statute,
in
an
action
or
a
proceeding,
and
have
found
those
costs
not
sufficiently
closely
enough
related
to
the
action
or
proceeding
to
justify
an
award.
and
also
courts
have
applied
the
rule
54
reasonableness
standard
in
ordering
costs
under
this
provision,
and
therefore,
expert
costs
have
been
reduced
and
other
costs
have
been
reduced
to
meet
the
general
requirements
of
rule
54.
i
would
like...
i
would
like
to--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--yes,
your
honor,
but
they've
also
imposed
limitations
that
are
generally...
that
generally
constrain
the
awards
of
costs
in
cases.
they
have
not
done
what...
what
i
understood
justice
alito...
his
question
to...
to
get
to,
was
to
use
this
as...
as
a
broad,
open
door.
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
legislative
history,
and
particularly
i'd
like
to
respond
to
justice
scalia's
comment
about
the
conference
report
in
this
case.
this
statute
was
changed
dramatically
in
conference.
it
does
not
reflect
either
the
house
bill
or
the
senate
bill.
if
one
reads
the
conference
report
in
the
joint
explanatory
statement
of
the
committee
of
the
conference,
which
is
three
pages
long,
one
will
see
that
there
were
dramatic
and
substantial
changes
made
because
there
were
substantial
disagreements
between
the
house
and
the
senate,
not
on
the
question
of
reimbursement
of
expert
costs.
that...
that
provision...
that
understanding
was
shared
on
a
bipartisan
basis
in
both
houses.
but
the--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--the...
the
version
that...
that
was
referred
to
earlier,
your
honor,
came
out
of
the
senate
bill.
the
senate
bill
contained
a
number
of
very
controversial
features.
it
was
pared
down,
and
the
word
cost
was
substituted,
as
the
drafter
of
the
language
made
clear
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
before
the
senate
voted
on
its
version
of
the
bill,
and
senator
weicker's
explanation
of
what
the
word
cost
means
could
not
be
clearer,
and
he...
he--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
i'm
happy
for
you
to
rely
on
the
joint
statement,
your
honor.
my
only
point
is,
is
that
the
understanding
in
the
house
report
is
expert
fees
were
included
in
the
house
bill,
which
referred
to
costs
and
expenses.
senator
weicker
explains
precisely
the
question
you
asked,
which
is
what
happened
to
the
senate
bill.
and
senator
weicker's
explanation,
which
was
made
before
the
senate,
immediately
before
the
senate
voted
on
the
bill,
makes
clear
that
expert
costs
are
included.
then,
of
course,
you
have
the
bill
going
to
conference.
there
were
many
changes
in
the
bill,
including
the
language
of
section
1415.
prior
to
the
conference,
it
did
not
say
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
costs.
it
said
attorneys'
fees
in
addition
to
costs.
that
language
was
changed
in
conference
to
accommodate
this
court's
decision
in
marek
v.
chesny,
which
had
to
do
with
the
applicability
of
rule
68.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
don't
believe
that
congress,
when
it
used
the
word
costs,
was
adverting
to
section
1920.
if
that
is
your
question,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
your
honor,
it
says...
it's
part
of
the
cost
to
the
parents.
and
unlike
section
1980,
this
language
is
not,
contrary
to
the
previous
submissions
to
the
court,
identical
to
the
language
in
1988.
it
says
that
a
court
may
award
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
the
costs
to
parents,
and
the--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--your
honor--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--under...
under
that
reading,
no
statute
would
authorize
the...
the
payment
of
costs.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that
is
correct.
let
me
make
one
last--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--i
have
not...
i've
not
looked
at
them
to
see
whether
they
correspond
to
1920,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
all
costs
are
subject
to
the
general
requirement
in
rule
54
of
reasonableness,
and--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--here's
the
reason,
your
honor.
at
least,
here's
the
reason
that...
as
i
understand
it.
much
of
the
litigation
in
idea
cases
takes
out...
takes
place
outside
the
confines
of
federal
court.
most
of
the
litigation
takes
place
in
state
due
process
hearings.
and
what
i
believe
congress
was
interested
in
making
sure
were
the
general
rules,
like
rule
11,
the
general
rules
that
punish
parties
for
engaging
in
vexatious
or
frivolous
litigation
would
have
some
analog
in
these
proceedings.
and
therefore,
what
the
court...
what...
what
congress
did
was
to
authorize
a
federal
court,
in
reviewing
an
application
for
attorneys'
fees
incurred
before
a
state
administered
tribunal,
because
that's
where
the
action
takes
place
in
these
cases,
to...
to
be
able
to
reduce
an
attorneys'
fee
award
if
there
was
misconduct
by
the
parent
or...
or
the
lawyer,
misconduct
in
the
sense
of
trying
to
protract
litigation
or
multiply
proceedings.
and
interestingly,
your
honor,
the...
the
conference
report
addresses
this
issue
and
does
explain...
and
now
i'm
quoting
from
page
6
of
the...
of
the
conference
report,
the
joint
explanation...
that
the
court
shall
accordingly
reduce
the
amount
of
attorneys'
fees
and
related
expenses
otherwise
allowable
if
they
determine
that
this
misconduct
had
taken
place.
so
i
think
that
at
least
in
the
conference
report,
congress
is
signaling
that
if
there
were
other
costs
that
were
incurred
unreasonably
as
a
result
of
lawyers
protracting
or
delaying
a
proceeding,
they
too
would
be
subject
to
the
same
reduction.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
this
is
not
one
committee
of
congress.
this
was...
this...
the
conference
report
was
circulated
to
all
members
of
congress
before
they
voted
on
the
final
bill.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
this
is
the
final
bill
they
voted
on,
and
if
they
turned
the
page--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
though
the
vote
technically,
of
course,
is
a
vote
to
approve
the
conference
report.
that
is
the
final
vote
congress
took
on
this
legislation.
the
vote
was
a
vote
to
approve
the
conference
report,
which
contains
four
pages...
three
pages
of
text
and
three
pages
of
explanation.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
the
procedure
followed
here
was
the
standard
procedure
when
the
conference
report
takes
bills
and
essentially
amalgamates
them
or
redrafts
them--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
do
not
know
that.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i...
he...
my
assumption,
your
honor,
is
he
had
this.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
don't
believe
that.
[laughter]
i'm
not
arguing
that
he
did.
my
assumption,
though,
is
if
he
had
the
statute
before
him,
he
probably
had
this.
the
president--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
and
one
of
the
points
that
i
would
like
to
make...
and
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
language
of
1415...
is
this
statute
is
all...
the
idea
is
a
statute
all
about
protecting
parents
and
children
with
disabilities.
one
provision
of
idea
we
have
not
mentioned,
but
i
think
is
an
important
one,
is
the
general
guarantee
that--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--if...
if
you're...
and...
and
forgive
my...
my
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
exact
history
of
this,
but
if
1988
is
a
date
upon
which
the
court
begins
to
be
reluctant
to
look
at
legislative
history,
i
would
concede
that
my
case
would
be
different
post
1988.
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
congress
that
enacted
this
bill
assumed,
and
rightly
so,
that
this
court
and
reviewing
courts
would
rely
on
legislative
history.
indeed,
when
this
court
issued
its
opinion
in
casey,
footnote
5
of
casey
says
that
this
case
may
be
different
because
of
the
conference
report.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
your
honor--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
court's
role,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
the
faithful
agent
of
congress,
and
if
the...
if
the
expectation
of
members
of
congress
is
that
language
in
committee
reports
will...
will
garner
respect
from
the
court,
it
is
hard
to
then
change
the
rules
on
congress.
the
operative
question
here
is
what--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--your
honor,
my
only
point
is
that
the
congress
that
enacted
this
statute,
the
99th
congress,
thought...
and
this...
this
view
is
expressed
repeatedly
in
the
legislative
history,
and
i
believe
it...
it
is
reflected
in
the
statutory
language
as
well...
that
the
word
costs
here
would
be
given
a
broad
meaning
to
ensure
that
parents
were
made
whole
when
they
have
to
fight
against
school
boards
to
secure
that
which
idea
guarantees
their
child,
which
is
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education.
this
court
has
repeatedly
in
township
of
burlington,
in
tatrow,
in
florence
county
said
that
provisions
of
idea
should
not
be
interpreted
in
ways
that
detract
from
this
fundamental
guarantee.
there
would
be
no
more
clear
detraction
from
that
guarantee
than
requiring
parents
to
bear
the
expense,
which
for
many
of
these
parents
is
enormous,
even
though
chief
justice,
it
may
amount
to
only
a
few
hundred
or
a
few
thousand
dollars,
to
retain
an
expert,
to
do
battle
with
school
boards
who
have
experts
on
staff.
earlier
this
term,
this
court
decided
schaffer
v.
weast.
post
schaffer,
parents
cannot
hope
to
meet
their
burden
of
production,
let
alone
their
burden
of
proof
in
idea
hearings
without
expert
assistance.
to
force
parents
to
bear
those
expenses,
even
when
they
prevail,
will
detract
from
idea's
core
guarantee
that
the...
that
the
education
provided
to
the
child
is
both
appropriate
and
free.
those
provisions
are
in
the
statute
to
avoid
having
parents
being
compelled
to
make
the
hobson's
choice,
a
free
education
that's
inappropriate
or
appropriate
education
that
is
not
free.
this
court
repeatedly
instructs
lower
courts
to
interpret
statutes
consistent
with
the
statutory
context.
i
would
urge
that
in
looking
at
section
1415,
you
take
a
look
at...
at...
there
are
now
eight
sections
of
the
statute
that
reinforce
this
guarantee.
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
statutory
guarantee
more
deeply
embedded
in
an
act
than
the
guarantee
of
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education
than
is
embedded
in
the
idea.
permitting
parents
to
recover
their
expert
costs--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--but...
but--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
they
lose
only
when
the
school
board
is
providing,
in
fact,
an
education
that
is
appropriate.
but
where
the
parent
prevails
because
the
school
board
was
not
providing
a
free
and
appropriate
education,
the
act's
guarantee
would
be
seriously
eroded
unless
parents
can
recover
the
costs
of
their
expert...
of
their
experts.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
