chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
davis
v.
washington.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
about...
what
if
you...
what
if
somebody
runs
out
of
the...
the
house?
there
are
two
people
standing
in
the
yard,
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
the
next
door
neighbor.
she
yells
at
the
next
door
neighbor,
he's
trying
to
kill
me,
and
then
he
comes
out.
is
that
covered
by
your
rule?
it's
not
to
a
law
enforcement
officer.
it's
to
the
next
door
neighbor,
but
the
law
enforcement
officer
overhears
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
was...
i
thought
that
was
to
determine
if
there
were
outstanding
orders
and
warrants
against
the
individual.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
related...
that's
related
to
sending
people
to
prevent
crime
as
opposed
to
gathering
evidence
to
be
used
to
convict.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they're
not
sending
someone...
they're
not
sending
someone
to
apprehend
mr.
davis.
they're
sending
someone
to
prevent
him
from
attacking
his
wife.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not...
that's
not
true
at
all.
i
mean,
if...
if
the...
the
witness
may
be
a
good
witness
and
compelling
on
the
stand,
they
may
have
every
incentive
to
bring
her
in
in
person.
this
is
only
addressed
to
the
situations
where
the
witness
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
testify.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
justice
scalia's
question
raises
the...
the
point.
the
reason
these
witnesses
are
not
there
is
not
because
of
anything
that
the
government
has
done.
it's...
it's
the
concern
they
have
with
a
particular
domestic
abuse
situation.
it's
not
the
government
that
is
keeping
these
witnesses
out.
they're
not
relying
on
the
911
calls
as
a
matter
of
preference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
mr.
whisman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your...
your
position
is
not
that
anything
that
she
says
or
anything
anyone
says
in
a
911
call
is...
is
consistent
with
the
confrontation
clause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
is
your...
what
is
your
test?
we
have
your
friend
saying
any
accusatory
statement
made
to
a
law
enforcement
officer.
what...
what
is
your
proposal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
fisher
tells
us
that's
exactly
what
happens,
that
the
911
operator
goes
through
the
elements
of
the
crime
in
a
very
structured
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
she's...
she's
in
ongoing...
the
operator
is
in
ongoing
contact
with
the
people
she's...
the
operator
has
dispatched.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe.
i
mean,
it's
easy
to
imagine
a
911
call
that
doesn't
fit
your
description.
you
know,
the
person
is
trying
to
get
in
the
door.
the
call
is...
you
know,
this
is
the
fourth
time.
i
keep
calling
and
i've
talked
to
you
about
this.
you
don't
do
anything.
he's
got
to
be
locked
up
so
this
will
stop.
i
mean,
that's
not...
that
sounds
more
like
testimony
than
an
immediate
call
for
help.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben,
you
say
focus
on
the
emergency
nature.
very
little
of
what
took
place
in
the
911
call
is
emergency.
he's
beating
me.
he's
jumping
on
me.
yes.
what's
his
name?
i
mean,
it's
not
like
they'll
send
help
if
his
name
is
joe
but
they
won't
if
it's
mike.
it
doesn't
matter.
which
direction
is
he
running?
that's
not
related
to
the
emergency
nature
of
the...
of
the
call.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
announcement
in
05-5224,
davis
versus
washington,
and
05-5705,
hammon
versus
indiana.
