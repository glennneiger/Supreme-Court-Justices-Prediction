anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
the
fact
that
it's
sole
proof
mean
that
it's
testimonial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
it...
it
adds
to
the
general
appeal
of
your
case
i...
i
suppose,
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
whether
or
not
it's
testimonial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did...
did
she
wait
until
after
the
4
minutes
to
call
the
police,
or
did
she...
she
have
the
police
on
the
way
after
the
first
minute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
she...
she's
just
typed
that
out
on
the
computer
or
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what...
what's
your
position
if
she
says
he
beat
me
2
minutes
ago,
he's
left,
and
he's
running
down
the
block?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose...
suppose
it's
a
thief,
and
she
said
he's
taken
the
diamond
necklace
and
he's
running...
and
he's
running
away.
we
know
he's
not
going
to
come
back.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the...
the
jewelry
store
owner
who
reports
to
the...
the
police
is
fleeing
on
a
911,
that...
that's
not...
that's
not
admissible
under
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what...
what
about
the...
my
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
concerned
about
the
rule
you're
arguing
today
because
it...
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
good
case
for
allowing
the...
the
statements
by
the
jewelry
store
operator.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is
so
that
you
don't
come
back
next
week
and
say,
well,
now
we
want
the
jewelry
store--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we've
got
to...
you
analyze
the
case
now
and
then
we'll
analyze
it
later.
