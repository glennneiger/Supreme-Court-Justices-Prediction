justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
point
the
finger
in
an
affidavit,
and
i
just
send
the
affidavit,
you
know.
i...
i
don't
want
to
get
involved.
i'm
in
a
foreign
country.
i
sign
my
name.
i
even
do
it
under
oath,
and
i
send
it
right
to
the
judge
that's
trying
the
case,
not
to
a
law
enforcement
officer,
to
the
judge.
you
don't
think
the
confrontation
clause
would
cover
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your...
your
thesis
that
it
applies
to
just
accusatory
statements
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
has
to
be
expanded
a
little.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
she
calling
911
for
if
she
didn't
want
help?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
she...
she
wanted
something
from
911.
what
did
she...
what
did
she
want?
did
she
want
the
police
to
come
over
and
arrest
her
husband?
was
that...
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
according
to
your
reading
of
the
cases,
but
you
really
don't
have
a
case
like
this.
you...
you
have
a
case
where,
after
the
fact,
the...
the
victim
went
to
a
constable
or
to
some
other
official
to
report
the
event,
and
perhaps
to
seek
help
against
the
person
who...
but
you
don't
have
anything
where
really,
in
the
course...
in
the
course
of
the
attack
or...
or
while
the
person
is
still
at
least
under
threat,
a...
a
constable
is...
is
called,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
have...
you
could
have
somebody
walking
by...
a
policeman
walking
by
outside.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
victim
shouting,
you
know,
please,
somebody
help
me,
harry
is
beating
me.
you
don't
have
a
case
like
that.
so...
so
i
don't
know
why
we
should
flop
one
side
rather
than
the
other
on
this...
on
this
case
that...
that
doesn't
seem
covered
by...
by
the
old
jurisprudence.
why
should
we
go
your
way
on
it
and
say
that
it...
it
falls
within
the
prohibition
rather
than
say
it
falls
outside
the
prohibition?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that's
not
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
of
the...
because
of
the
confrontation
clause
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
assume
the
defendant
could
summon
that...
that
witness
if...
if
that
witness'
location
was
known.
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
could
find
out
from
the
prosecution
where
that
witness
was,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
we
should
just...
just
suspend
the
confrontation
clause
in
spousal
abuse
cases
instead
of
designing
the
entire
application
of
the
confrontation
clause
everywhere
on
the
basis
of
what
seems
to
be
a
special
problem
in
spousal
abuse
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose
we
could
also
have
said
that
the
sixth
amendment,
like
some
other
amendments,
doesn't
apply
to
state
prosecutions--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
the
confrontation
clause
portion
of
that,
anyway,
which
would
exempt
spousal
abuse
cases,
by
and
large,
until
we...
until
we
enact
a
federal
spousal
abuse
statute,
which...
which
may
well
occur.
it
seems
to
me
there...
there
are
better
ways
to...
to
solve
this
problem
than
to
design
the
whole
confrontation
clause
jurisprudence
on
the
basis
of
what
happens
in
spousal
abuse
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
what
is
his
name?
i
mean,
that's
the
present
tense.
not
what
was
his
name
or
what
will
be
his
name.
what
is
his
name?
you
think
that's
the
present
tense.
so
that
shows
that
this
is
all
seeking
help.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
powerful
is
part
of
the
problem.
this...
this
kind
of
telephone
call
evidence
is
even
more
powerful
than...
than
the
kind
of
a
signed
affidavit
that
used
to
be
banned
because
it
was
testimonial.
i
mean,
to
hear...
to
hear
the
voice
on
the
phone
makes
it,
if
it
is...
if
it
is
impermissible
under
the
confrontation
clause,
it
makes
it
even
a
more
damaging
violation
than
the
kind
of
violation
that...
that
occurred
in...
in
sir
walter
raleigh's
case,
for
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you...
would
you
rather
put
the
woman
on...
if
you
had
a
choice,
would
you
rather
put
the
woman
on
the
stand?
justice
antonin
scalia
rather
than
have
her...
her
voice
on
the
telephone
call--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
she
is...
she
is
in...
in...
supposedly
in
great
fear
of...
of
her
husband
and...
and...
i'm
sure
you'd
rather
have
the
telephone
call.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
prosecutor.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
an
easier
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's...
let's
not
overread
crawford.
crawford
didn't
say
that
the
only
thing
the
confrontation
clause
was
directed
at
was
the
kind
of
abuse
that...
that
occurred
in
the
case
of
sir
walter
raleigh.
it
said
that
that
was
the
principal
abuse
at
which
it
was
directed.
i
doubt
very
much,
unless
you
think
otherwise,
that
if
somebody,
without
provocation
from
the
police,
wrote
up
an
affidavit,
signed
the
affidavit,
and
gave
it
to
the
police,
i
doubt
whether
that
would
have
been
allowed
under
the
confrontation
clause.
do
you
think
it
would
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
test
wouldn't
cover
the
example
i
just
gave.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
that
should
be
admissible
in
a
criminal
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
if
the
person
disappears
afterwards,
is
unavailable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
imagine
that
that
wouldn't
have
been
covered
by
the
confrontation
clause--
justice
antonin
scalia
--such...
such
an
obvious
violation
of
your
right
to
confront
your
accuser,
and
just
because
it
was
presented
to
the
police
without...
without
an
initial
interrogation
by
the
police,
i
don't
think
that
would
have
made
any
difference
at
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
that
that's
the
extreme,
but
you're
urging
us
to...
to
adopt
a
test
that
embraces
only
the
extreme
and
does
not
embrace
the
hypothetical
i
just
gave
you.
and
you...
you
can
accept
that
hypothetical
without
saying
that
you
lose
this
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
test
you're
proposing
is...
is
really
quite
extreme.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
do
we
do
about
the...
about
the
fact,
which
i
don't
think
you...
you
deny
and...
and
the...
the
other
side
points
out
in
both
of
these
cases
that,
in
fact,
police
departments
have
their
responders
to
the
911
number
intentionally
ask
a
series
of
questions
that
gives
them
all
the
information
they
need
to
conduct
a
prosecution?
in
other
words,
they
are
using
911
as
a...
as
a
prosecutorial
device.
justice
antonin
scalia
disappearing.
not
just
not
appearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
husband
had
left
the
house
here,
as
i
understand
it,
when
this...
when
this
call
occurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
she...
she
wanted
the
man
arrested,
but
he
was
no
longer
in
the
house,
was
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
seeking
help?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
seeking
help
means
trying
to
get
somebody
arrested,
trying
to
get
somebody
who
has
harmed
you
arrested.
in
this
case,
he
was
gone
out
of
the
house.
she
had
gone
and
locked
the
door
before
she
came
back
to
the
phone
and
gave
most
of
this
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
in
the...
in
the
jeweler
case,
the
guy
is
running
down
the
street.
what
is
the
jeweler...
is
the
jeweler
really
worried
about
the
guy
turning
around
and
coming
back
to
rob
some
more?
he
wants
the
man
arrested.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's...
it's...
it
may
be
not
a
lot,
but
it's
something.
you
don't
have
anything
to
the
contrary.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
anything
which
shows
that
these
hue
and
cry
reports
were
admitted,
and
there
were
a
lot
of
them.
they...
they
were
done
regularly.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
say
that
a
hue
and
cry
report
is
not
the
same
as
a
woman
being
beaten
and...
and
picking
up
the
phone
while
the
crime
is
progress.
but
i
think
it's
quite
similar
to
the...
the
jewelry
hypothetical
that
justice
kennedy
gave
you
which
you're
unwilling
to
say
is...
is
not
covered
by
the...
is
covered
by
the
confrontation
clause,
and
i
think
it's
quite
similar
to
a
woman,
where
the
husband
has
left
and
she's
locked
the
door
and
she
wants
the
husband
arrested.
i
think
it's
quite
similar
to
that.
but
for
the
telephone,
it's...
it's
someone
who's
been
the
victim
of
a
crime
who
goes
to
a
public
official,
as
soon
as
possible,
and
says,
i've
been...
i've
been
subject
to
a
crime.
i
want
to
report
the
crime
and
have
the
person
arrested.
i
think
it's
very
similar.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
wouldn't
say
that
every
question
asked
in
that
context.
don't
we
have
to
do
it
question
by
question?
i
mean,
what
if
one
of
the
questions
was,
you
know,
has
he
beaten
you
before?
how
many
times
before?
you
know,
are
you
going
to
allow
that
in
too--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
an
excited
utterance?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
me
again.
these
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
respectively.
the
question
before
us
in
both
cases
is
whether
the
admission
of
out-of-court
statements
violated
the
6th
amendment’s
confrontation
clause,
which
states,
“in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him”.
the
facts
of
each
case,
described
in
brief,
are
as
follows.
in
the
first
of
them,
davis,
a
911
operator
received
a
frantic
call
from
michelle
mccottry,
who
was
involved
in
an
ongoing
domestic
disturbance
with
davis,
her
former
boyfriend.
the
operator
asked
mccottry
a
number
of
questions
to
determine
what
was
happening
and
some
questions
about
davis
to
determine
whether
the
dispatched
police
officers
would
be
dealing
with
a
dangerous
felon.
at
some
point
during
the
911
call,
davis
apparently
left
mccottry’s
home.
police
arrived
on
the
scene
within
four
minutes
of
the
call.
the
state
of
washington
charged
davis
with
felony
violation
of
a
domestic
no-contact
order.
at
trial,
only
the
police
who
arrived
on
the
scene
after
davis
had
left
testified.
mccottry
herself
did
not.
but
the
prosecutor
offered
a
recording
of
the
911
call,
which
identified
davis
as
the
assailant
and
which
was
admitted
over
davis’s
confrontation
clause
objection.
the
jury
convicted
him,
the
washington
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
as
did
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
which
held
that
mccottry’s
statements
were
nontestimonial.
in
the
other
case,
hammon,
a
domestic
disturbance
call
lead
police
to
the
home
of
hershel
and
amy
hammon.
they
found
amy
sitting
on
the
front
porch.
she
told
them
that
nothing
was
wrong.
but
they
asked
for
and
received
amy’s
permission
to
enter
the
home.
inside,
they
observed
a
living
room
showing
signs
of
an
altercation,
including
a
broken
heater.
hershel,
amy’s
husband,
was
sitting
alone
in
the
kitchen.
the
officers
asked
him
what
had
happened,
he
told
them
that
he
and
his
wife
had
had
a
disagreement,
but
that
it
never
became
physical.
at
some
point,
amy
came
back
inside
and
went
into
the
living
room.
one
of
the
officers
stayed
with
hershel
in
the
kitchen
while
the
other
went
to
ask
amy
about
the
night’s
events
once
more.
this
time,
she
described
the
altercation
in
some
detail,
saying
that
it
began
over
a
dispute
about
their
daughter,
that
it
evolved
from
being
verbal
to
being
physical,
that
hershel
started
breaking
things,
that
he
threw
her
down,
shoved
her
and
punched
her.
the
state
of
indiana
charged
hershel
…
after
hearing
her
story,
the
officer
asked
her
to
write
it
out
on
a
battery
affidavit,
a
regular
form
that
this
police
department
had,
and
to
sign
that
affidavit,
which
she
did.
the
state
of
indiana
charged
hershel
with
domestic
battery.
amy
did
not
appear
at
the
subsequent
trial.
although
hershel
objected
on
confrontation
clause
grounds,
amy’s
statements
about
the
events
in
question
were
admitted,
both
through
the
testimony
of
the
officer
who
had
questioned
her
and
through
the
battery
affidavit
that
she
had
signed.
hershel
was
convicted.
the
indiana
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
as
did
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
it
concluded
that
although
the
affidavit
was
testimonial
and
had
been
wrongly
admitted,
it
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
officer’s
testimony
about
amy’s
oral
statements
to
him,
on
the
other
hand,
the
indiana
supreme
court
held
were
not
testimonial.
we
granted
certiorari
in
both
cases,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
davis
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
in
hammon.
in
a
2004
case
called
crawford
versus
washington,
we
held
that
the
confrontation
clause
bars
the,
“admission
of
testimonial
statements
of
a
witness
who
did
not
appear
at
trial
unless
he
was
unavailable
to
testify
and
the
defendant
had
had
a
prior
opportunity
for
cross
examination”,
which,
of
course,
did
not
exist
in
either
of
these
cases.
we
hold
today,
as
we
implied
in
crawford,
that
the
confrontation
clause
extends
only
to
statements
that
are
testimonial.
that
is
clear
from
the
text
of
the
clause,
which
requires
confrontation
of
witnesses;
“witnesses”
are
those
who
bear
testimony.
none
of
the
cases
exemplifying
the
confrontation
requirement
at
the
time
of
the
framing
applied
it
to
nontestimonial
hearsay,
such
as
a
victim’s
cries
for
help.
to
be
sure,
most
of
those
early
cases
involved
testimonial
statements
of
the
most
formal
sort,
such
as
sworn
testimony
in
prior
judicial
proceedings
or
formal
dispositions
under
oath,
but
not
all
them
did.
we
do
not
think
it
conceivable
that
the
clause’s
protections
can
be
evaded
by
having
a
policeman
recite
a
defendant’s
unsworn
testimony
rather
than
the
policeman’s
having
a
declarant
sign
a
deposition
to
the
same
substantive
effect.
in
davis,
therefore,
we
must
ask
whether
objectively
considered
the
interrogation
that
took
place
in
the
course
of
the
911
call
produced
testimonial
statements.
we
conclude
that
it
did
not.
911
calls
are
ordinarily
designed
to
describe
current
circumstances
that
require
immediate
police
assistance.
this
case
is
no
different.
mccottry
was
trying
to
obtain
help
to
meet
an
ongoing
emergency;
she
was
not
acting
as
a
witness.
she
was
speaking
in
the
present
tense
about
events
as
they
were
actually
happening,
not
reporting
on
events
that
were
done.
objectively
view,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
911
operator’s
interrogation
was
to
enable
police
assistance
to
meet
the
ongoing
emergency.
in
hammon,
by
contrast,
the
statements
were
testimony.
in
relevant
respects,
they
were
not
much
different
from
those
that
we
held
to
be
testimonial
in
crawford.
there
was
no
ongoing
emergency;
the
police,
quite
properly,
conducted
an
investigation
into
whether,
as
they
suspected,
past
events
of
a
criminal
nature
had
occurred.
such
an
investigation
required
them
to
ask
amy
to
tell
them
what
had
happened
so
that
they
could
decide
whether
to
arrest
hershel,
not
to
end
an
independent
emergency
that
was
in
progress.
objectively
viewed,
the
primary,
if
not
the
sole,
purpose
of
the
interrogation
in
that
case
was
to
investigate
a
possible
crime.
from
the
perspective
of
the
sixth
amendment’s
text
again,
witnesses
in
court
narrate
and
attest
to
the
truth
of
past
events,
which
is
precisely
what
amy
hammon
did.
to
summarize
our
holdings
in
these
cases,
statements
are
nontestimonial
when
made
in
the
course
of
police
interrogation
under
circumstances
objectively
indicating
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
interrogation
is
to
enable
police
assistance
to
meet
an
ongoing
emergency.
they
are
testimonial
when
the
circumstances
objectively
indicate
that
there
is
no
such
ongoing
emergency
and
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
interrogation
is
to
establish
or
prove
past
events
potentially
relevant
to
later
criminal
prosecution.
finally,
we
again
emphasize,
as
we
did
in
crawford,
and
note
that
both
of
the
abused
spouses
in
these
cases
did
not
testify,
which
is
not
an
unusual
phenomenon.
for
that
reason,
we
again
emphasize,
as
we
did
in
crawford,
that
while
the
prosecution
may
not
deprive
a
defendant
of
the
right
to
confrontation,
a
defendant
may
forfeit
that
right;
for
example,
by
procuring
or
coercing
the
absence
of
a
witness.
the
doctrine
of
forfeiture
by
wrongdoing
is
an
established
equitable
principle
necessary
to
allow
courts
to
protect
the
integrity
of
their
proceedings.
on
remand,
the
indiana
courts
may,
if
they
are
asked,
determine
whether
a
claim
of
forfeiture
is
properly
raised
and,
if
so,
whether
it
is
meritorious.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
is
affirmed,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
is
reversed,
and
the
case
in
the
latter
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
davis
and
dissenting
in
hammon.
