counsel,
when
you
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
did
use
the
word
inquisitorial,
and
there's
one
large
difference,
it
seems.
this
is
not
a
magistrate
judge
or
a
police
officer
coming
to
a
person
for
an
interview.
this
is
initiated
by
the
caller,
by
the
victim,
and
it's
initially
a
cry
for
help.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
said
that
the
call
was
initiated
by
the
victim.
it
wasn't
a...
a
police
officer
coming
to
interview
her.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
splitting
up
two
things
that
i
think
go
together.
that
is,
this
is
not
just
a
call.
this
is
a
cry
for
help.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said...
you
said
we
don't
know,
but
you...
that's
slightly
in
conflict
with
what
you
said
earlier.
they
asked
26
questions.
how
long
was
this
telephone
conversation
between
the
911
operator
and
the
victim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
a
simple
cry
for
help
that
doesn't
say
i'm
being
battered
may
not
elicit
an
immediate
response
on
the
part
of
the
police.
this
kind
of
call,
i
need
help
now,
and
the
information
that
comes
with
it
is
likely
to
be
given
priority
attention
as
this
very
call
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there...
is
there...
suppose
the
defendant
procured
the
witness'
absence
by
a
threat.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
the
911
statement
could
come
in.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
are...
those
are
three
neat
legal
categories.
the
practical
reality,
is
it
not
so,
is
that
many
women
in
these
situations
are
scared
to
death
of
what
will
happen
to
them
or
they're
so
insecure
financially
that
they
think
they
have
to
put
up
with
the
battering?
so
your
neat
legal
categories
really
don't
conform
to
what
happens
in
people's
lives
who
are
in
this
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
don't
you
incorporate
what
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested,
that
is,
you
draw
the
line
at
urgent
emergency
statements
that
are
calling
for...
for
immediate
help?
