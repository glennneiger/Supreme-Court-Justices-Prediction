is
it
your
argument
that
any
statement
made
to
law
enforcement
is
testimonial?

that's
what
you
said
in

well,
what
if
the
only
question...
what
if
a
911
caller
says
nothing
more
than,
in
a
very
excited
way,
someone
is
attacking
me,
send
a
police
officer
right
away
to
make
the
person
stop
attacking
me?
is
that
testimonial?
