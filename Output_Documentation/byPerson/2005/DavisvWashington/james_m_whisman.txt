mr.
james
m.
whisman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
in
this
911
call,
the
operator
asked
a
short
series
of
questions,
nearly
all
phrased
in
the
present
tense.
each
question
was
objectively
and
reasonably
necessary
to
respond
to
an
apparent
emergency.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
no,
a
number
of
other
questions,
justice
scalia,
were
answered...
were
asked
in
the
present...
present
tense
too.
and,
in
fact,
the
operator,
shortly
after
asking
the
first
questions,
one
of
the
first
things
that
she
said
was
help
was
on
the
way
and
then
continued
with
a
series
of
questions.
but
as
the
interview
continued,
of
course,
every
single
question
and
every
single
answer
was
captured
on
the
tape
for
a
jury
or
a
judge
to
later
hear.
the
call
ended
after
the
operator
knew
that
ms.
mccottry
had
her
door
locked,
that
davis
had
left,
and
that
the
officer's
arrival
was
imminent.
we
ask...
respectfully
ask
this
court,
under
these
circumstances,
to
hold
that
the
use
of
this
powerful
evidence,
without
live
testimony
from
the
declarant,
was
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
well,
i'd
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
although
i'd...
i'd
first
note
that...
that
i
think
the
if
clause
in
your
honor's
question
is
telling.
and
i
think
if
that...
that
doesn't
necessarily
define
whether
it's
testimonial
or
not.
but
to
address--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and...
and--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--well,
if
i
had
to--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--if
you're
asking
me
which
would
i
choose--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--well,
if
i
had
to
choose,
that
would
be
a
difficult
choice,
obviously,
but
our
plan,
of
course,
was
to--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--our...
our
plan
was
to
do
both,
and
it
wasn't
until
the
eve
of
trial
that
we
learned
that
the
complaining
witness,
ms.
mccottry,
wasn't
going
to
appear.
and
i
think
that
the
circumstances--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--she
was
already
subpoenaed,
your
honor,
and
the
prosecutor
brought
in
the
detective.
the
detective
attempt...
made
numerous
attempts
to
get
a
hold
of
her,
checked
her
last
known
address.
the
person
there
didn't
know
where
she
was.
we
had
one
phone
number
for
her.
she
wasn't
responding
to
the
telephone
calls
pursuant
to
our
calls
to
that
number.
so
we
made
a
number
of
efforts
that
are
documented
in
the
record
to
get
her
to
court,
once
we
learned
that...
that
she
didn't
appear.
now,
at
that
point--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--that's
right,
your
honor.
it's
conceivable
that
you
could
have
statements
made
in
the
course
of
a
911
call
that
wouldn't
be
testimonial.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
our
focus,
your
honor,
is,
as
i
think
this
court
focused
in
crawford
on
whether
or
not
the
government's
practice
resembles
the
inquisitorial
abuses.
in
other
words,
did
you
have...
in
the
modern
sense,
did
you
have
a
structured
police
interrogation
such
that
the
interrogator
or
the
questioner
might
have
in
some
way
shaped
the
witness'
testimony.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
well,
i...
i
think
if
you
listen
to
the
tape
itself,
you'll
conclude
that's
not
the
case.
i
mean,
in
fact,
each
question
that
the...
that
the
operator
asked
was
reasonably
and
objectively
designed
to
facilitate
a
quick
response
and
to
solve
the
emergency
that
was
apparent.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
well,
it
may
not
have,
your
honor,
but
the...
under
the
test
that
we're
proposing,
the...
we're
placing
the
focus
on
situations
like
this,
situations
roughly
analogous...
situations
that
are
distinguishable
from
what
you
had
with
sylvia
crawford.
and
i
think
that
although...
although
our
test
may
not
cover
every
conceivable
hypothetical,
i
think
that,
as
this
court
recognized
in
crawford,
defining
testimonial
was
going
to
be
a...
a
task
that
was
going
to
take
some
time,
and--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--no,
that's
right,
your
honor.
our
test
would
not--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--no,
i
don't.
i
think
it--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--that
should
be
inadmissible,
but
it
should
be
inadmissible
because
of
the
rules
of
hearsay.
and
i
think
in
most
states
in
the
union,
it
would
be
inadmissible.
i
can't
think
of
a
hearsay
example
that
would
permit
it.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
fair
enough.
it's
not
an
excited
utterance.
it's
not
a
present
sense
impression.
i
can't
imagine
a
hearsay
exception
that
would
admit
it,
which
is
really
what
brings
us
back
to
the
core
of
our
theory,
too,
and
that
is
that...
that
under
the
confrontation
clause,
as
defined
in
crawford,
we
now
have
an
absolute
rule
covering
a
finite--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--well--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--and...
and,
your
honor,
it
may
be
that
at
some
point
the
court
expands
the
definition
in...
in
crawford
of
testimonial...
formalized
testimonial
materials
to
include
something
like
that,
but
i
think
that
in
situations
where
you
have
an
encounter
between
police
and
a
citizen
and
statements
result,
then
i
think
it's
fair
to
focus
on
the
interaction
and
whether
or
not
the...
the
person
was
trying
to
shape
the
testimony.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
well,
your
honor,
as
i
say,
the
test
we're
proposing
i
think
would
cover
the
majority
of
cases.
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
posed
was...
is...
is
itself
i
think
somewhat
unusual.
we...
we
do
not
get
statements
of
that
nature.
we
do
not
see
them
being
offered
into
evidence.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
that
if...
if
we
saw
cases
like
that,
if
we
saw
statements
that
were
admitted,
there
may
be
other
ways
under
the
clause
that
the
court
could
interpret
the
confrontation
clause
to
exclude
them.
i'm
not
arguing
for
the
admissibility
of
that
evidence.
quite
frankly,
i've
never
in
my
life
even
seen
a
piece
of
evidence
like
that
offered.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i
don't
believe
it
falls
under
this
narrow
definition
of
the
confrontation
clause
that
you
outlined
in
the
crawford
case.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
we
certainly
don't
have
any
objections
to
the
solicitor
general's
approach,
your
honor,
and...
and
in
fact,
in
some
ways,
because
we're
analyzing
a
case
like
this
that
arose
in
an
emergency
circumstance,
i
think
that
it's
clear
that...
that
statements
that
are
made
in
those
circumstances,
just
by
their
very
nature,
aren't
going
to
be
testimonial.
people
don't
testify
in
an
emergency.
we
chose
not
to
take
that
approach
doctrinally
just
because
we
didn't
think
it
was
as
closely
tied
to
the
approach
the
court
took
in
crawford.
but
i
think
it's
certainly
consistent
with
the
strategy
outlined
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
well,
i
think
that
overstates
the
empirical
evidence,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
training
manual
in
this
case
that
we
attached
to
our
briefing
in
the
supreme
court
and
refer
to
our
briefing,
if
you
look
at
the
way
that
this
interview
was
conducted,
it's
clear
that
these
operators
are
not,
as
a
routine
matter,
using
the
911
process
to
develop
evidence.
in
fact,
in
this
case
you'll
note
that...
that
after
the
short
4-minute
period,
the
operator
didn't
say,
well,
stay
on
the
line
with
me
a
little
bit
more
and
let's
talk
about
the
background
situation
here.
and
she
didn't
do
that
because
her
training,
as
documented
in
the
training
materials
from
the
valley
communications
center,
said
don't
get
caught
up
in
the
background
information
that
led
to
this
event
because
it
can
distract
you
in
getting
the
information
that
needs
to
be
transferred
to
the
police
department
right
away.
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
and
really
the...
the
better
approach
for
a
911
operator.
so
even
though--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--it
sounds
as
though
that
she
dispatched
them
immediately,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--that's
right.
and,
in
fact,
there
are
some
times
when
you
can
hear
all
three
voices
on
the
911
tape,
not
in
this
instance.
but
as
i
said,
almost
immediately
after
the
call
began,
she
said,
help
is
on
the
way,
that's
because
you
can
dispatch
but
still
obtain
information,
for
example,
the
date
of
birth.
and
as
mr.
chief
justice
indicated,
date
of
birth
of
the
defendant
and
name,
et
cetera
are
extremely
important
so
that
in
those
4
minutes
that
it...
coincidentally,
it
was
also
4
minutes
before
the
police
officer
arrived...
they
can
be
determining
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
a
criminal
history.
they
can
determine
whether
or
not,
from
their
records
available
to
them
in
the
police
car,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
a
history
of
assaults
against
police
officers,
whether
or
not
he
has
a...
a
history
of
carrying
weapons,
et
cetera.
so
that's
all
information
that
the
operators
are
trained
to...
to
obtain
and
then
to
transfer
to
the
police
as
soon
as
possible.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
why...
that's
why
ordinarily
the
operator
doesn't
terminate
the
call
until
the
police
have
arrived
on
the
scene.
here
it
appears
that
she
terminated
the
call
somewhat
contemporaneously
with
their
arrival.
she...
she
indicates
that
the
police
are
there
and
they'll
look
around
for
him
quickly
and
then
come
and
check
her.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
as
significant
as
petitioner
suggests.
if
you
look
at
the
record,
in
the
pretrial
testimony
of
officer
jones,
he
asked
ms.
mccottry,
upon
arrival,
repeatedly
did
she
know
who
this
other
person
was,
and
her
answer
was
she
didn't
know
the
person's
last
name.
the
record
isn't
fully
developed
on
that
point,
but
it
sounds
like
that...
that
mike
was
a
friend
of
the
defendant's.
and
we
know
for
sure
that
mike
left
with
the
defendant.
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
infer
he
also
came
with
the
defendant,
but
we
didn't
have
any
particular
contact
or
handle
on
this
person
mike.
and
in
fact,
if
it
was
a
friend
of
the
defendant,
you'd
think
that
the
compulsory
process
clause
would
have
given
the
defendant
some
basis
on
which
to
bring
him
before
the
court.
i
don't
think
that
that
includes
any
of
the...
that...
that
doesn't
somehow
shift
the
burden
on
the
defendant
in
the
same
way
it
might
if
were
to
force
him
to
bring
the
declarant
in.
if
he
knew
mike,
he...
he
certainly
had
the
ability
to
bring
mike
in.
so
i
don't
think
it's
as
significant
as
petitioner
suggests.
your
honor,
i...
i
do
want
to
return
for
just
one
moment
to
this
notion
that
we
don't
want
witnesses
to
testify
and
that
we
are
satisfied
with
proceeding
just
on...
on
the
basis
of
other
pieces
of
evidence.
at
least
in
my
practice
and
at
least
in
our
county,
that's
definitely
not
true.
in
fact,
even
if
we
have
a
recanting
witness
in,
for
example,
the
domestic
violence
abuse
scenario...
situation,
it
is
often
just
as
effective
for
us
to
go
ahead
and
put...
put
the
witness
up
on
the
stand,
let
her
tell
whatever
story
she's
presently
telling,
and
then
play
the
911...
911
tape
also
in
conjunction
with
the
testimony
of
the
officers
who
can
describe
what...
what
condition
she
was
in
when
they
arrived.
and
i
think
when
you
juxtapose
the
911
tape,
even
with
the
recantation
from
the
witness,
frankly
sometimes
the
jurors
find
it
even
more
illuminating
than...
than
if
she
didn't
appear.
so
we
do
not
spend
our
time
trying
to
put
together
cases
purposely
without
the
victim
testifying.
it
just
so
happens
that
sometimes,
at
the
last
minute
like
this
case,
we're
not
able
to
bring
the
person
in.
but
i
think--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--your
honor,
i
do...
i
cannot
answer
in
a
percentage
terms
how
often
this
happens.
but,
you
know,
that
you
have
a
reluctant
witness
in
domestic
violence
cases
is
a...
is
a
not
unusual
occurrence
in
any
event.
but
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--as
i
say,
i'm...
i'm
hard
pressed
to
give
a...
a
percentage
number.
but
it's
not,
as
i
said--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--i
believe
it
has.
mr.
james
m.
whisman
i
can't
say,
no,
your
honor.
i
can't
say.
i
think
it's
maybe
happened
once
to
me,
but--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--well,
i...
i
think
the
other
factor
that
has
to
be
considered,
your
honor,
is
as
soon...
as
soon
as
defendants
realize
that
merely
pressuring
the
victim
into
not
appearing
will
put
an
end
to
the
case,
then
it
gives
the
defendant
the
increased
incentive
to
put
the
pressure
on
the
victim
and
cases
that
otherwise
would
have
pled
won't.
so
i
think
it
will
have--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--yes.
i--
mr.
james
m.
whisman
--thank
you,
your
honor.
