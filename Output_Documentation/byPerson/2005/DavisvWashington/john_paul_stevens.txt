justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
i...
i
guess
in
an
awful
lot
of
these
cases
there's
a
mixed
motive,
protection
and
the
enforcement.
is
it
your
view
that
whenever
there's
a
mixed
motive,
it
becomes
inadmissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
failure
to
inquire
about
mike?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
one
last
question.
how
do
you
think
professor
wigmore
would
have
decided
this
case?
[laughter]
