david
h.
souter
do
you
have
any--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
in
doing
that,
do
you
distinguish,
for
example,
between
the...
the
expectation
that
lies
behind
a
merely
excited
utterance,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
expectation
or
lack
of
expectation
that
would
qualify...
that
would
be
the
case
in
a...
in
a
true
res
gestae
statement
in
the
very
strict
sense?
so
that,
you
know,
if...
if
the
attack
had
occurred
30
minutes
beforehand
and...
and
the
victim
is
saying
on
the
telephone
to
the
police,
adrian
is
trying
to
kill
me,
that
would
be...
that...
that
wouldn't...
would
not
be
admissible,
i
take
it,
on...
on
your
view
under
the
confrontation
clause.
and
yet,
if
in
the
course
of
the
911
call,
adrian
was
battering
the...
the...
you
know,
the
victim
over
the
head
with
something
and
she
blurted
out
the
same
statement,
he's
trying
to
kill
me,
would
the...
would
the
latter
be
admissible
in
your
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--under
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke.
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
answer
to
my
question
is
there
would
be
no
distinction
between
the
merely
excited
utterance
30
seconds
later
and
the
utterance
in
the
course
of
in...
in
my
hypo.
justice
david
h.
souter
did...
did
you
subpoena
her
at
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
how...
how
often
does
this
happen?
in
other
words,
are
we
being
asked
to,
in
effect,
on
your
part
to...
to
recognize
or
to
derive
a
special
rule
for
cases
which,
at
least
numerically,
are
sports?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
i'm
talking
about
the
witness
who
is
not
merely
reluctant,
but
simply
doesn't
show
up
and
you
make
reasonable
efforts
and
you...
and
you
can't
find
the
witness.
how
often
does
that
happen?
justice
david
h.
souter
has
it
happened
to
you
before?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
don't
know
how
many
times.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
we're
not...
i
take
it
we're
not
in
a
position
whereby
if
we
hold
against
you,
we
are,
in
effect,
nullifying
the
possibility
of
enforcing
domestic
violence
laws
by
criminal
process.
