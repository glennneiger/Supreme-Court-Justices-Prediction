mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
a
panic
stricken
call
for
help,
which
can
occur
on
a
911
call,
is
not
a
form
of
bearing
witness
within
the
meaning
of
the
confrontation
clause
that
activates
the
rule
in
crawford.
emergency
statements,
statements
that
are
made
to
911
operators
and
to
officers
at
the
scene
investigating
an
urgent
need
to
protect
a
person's
safety,
do
not
resemble
the
classic
forms
of
testimonial
evidence
that
were
generated
under
the
marian
statutes
and
the
civil
law
practice
that
formed
the
impetus
for
the
confrontation
clause.
in
three
significant
respects,
statements
that
are
made
in
emergency
questioning
differ
from
the
kind
of
testimony
that
prompted
the
rule
in
crawford
and
the
confrontation
right
that
it
rests
on.
first
of
all,
in
the
classic
examples
of
someone
giving
testimony,
which
this
court
noted
means
a
solemn
declaration
or
affirmation
for
the
purpose
of
proving
a
fact,
people
who
are
on
911
calls
or
seeking
help
at
the
scene
of
an...
an
urgent
situation
are
not
making
statements
for
the
purpose
of
providing
evidence
in
a
case.
they
are
making
statements
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
help,
and
that
distinguishes
them
significantly
from
the
kinds
of
subtle
desires
to
shape
and
influence
their
statements
that
occur--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
distinguish
between
those
kinds
of
911
calls
where
someone
is
seeking
protection
from
an
imminent
or
present
threat
to
their
safety
and
a
911
call
that's
making
a
more
generalized
report
of
criminal
activity
or
a
desire
for
safety
and
maybe
speaking
in
a
narrative
form
about
the
past.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
actually,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--actually,
justice
scalia,
i
believe
when
the
call
begins,
the
caller
is
speaking
in
the
present
tense
and
says,
he's
here
jumping
on
me
again.
and
the
911
operator
then
begins
to
elicit
information
to
find
out
what
is
the
level
of
the
threat
to
her
safety
and
what
actions
need
to
be
taken
and
says,
okay,
i've
got
help
started.
help
is
on
the
way.
now,
tell
me
what
his
name
is,
and
she...
the...
the
caller
tells
what
the
name
is
of
the
defendant
and,
at
that
point,
says,
he's
running
now.
and
so,
it's
only
after
critical
information
is
imparted
at
the
beginning
of
the
call
that
the
caller
says
that
he's
leaving.
but
even--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
in
that
situation,
justice
kennedy,
there
is
still
an
imminent
threatened
potential
of
a
recurrence.
the
person
could
come
back.
there's
no
protection
on
the
scene.
the
reason
that
she's
calling
911
and
not
a
friend
or...
or
a
health
care
provider
is
that
she
believes
she
needs
protection
right
then.
and
the...
the
nature
of
an
emergency
is
such
that
it
exerts
a
pressure
both
on
the
person
who
is
seeking
help,
as
well
as
the
official
responder
from
the
government,
to
solve
that
urgent
problem.
any
evidentiary
benefit
that
may
come
from
that
is
really
an
incidental--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that...
that
situation
would
not
fall
within
the
emergency
rule
that
the
government
is
arguing
for
today.
what
we're
arguing
for
is
a
rule
that
deals
when
people's
safety
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i'm
not
saying
that,
justice
kennedy.
i'm
saying
that
the
court
isn't
confronted
in
this
case
with
a
situation
in
which
threats
not
to
the
person
but
to
property
or
the
need
to
obtain
or
try
to
apprehend
a
fleeing
felon
are
present.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
would
submit
that
that
is
not
testimonial
within
the
meaning
of
crawford
for
many
of
the
same
reasons
that...
that
are
present
in
this
case.
but
it
is
a
different
case
from
this.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
urgency
certainly
in...
in
the
jewelry
thief
hypothetical
does
deal
with
apprehending
the
person
who
has
just
stolen
the
goods.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
it
falls
outside
of
the
rule
that
the
government
is
arguing
for
today.
but,
justice
scalia,
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
there
is
a
good--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
we
wouldn't,
depending
on
how
the
court
analyzes
this
case,
argue
for
a
submission
that
that's
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
the
court
needs
to
analyze
today
is
whether
an
emergency
statement
where
somebody
is
seeking
protection
and
there
is
a
threat
of
imminent
recurrence
of
the
very
violence
that
has
triggered
the
call
is
testimony.
and
it's
not
testimony
because
the
sort
of
risks
of
government
shaping
and
the
declarant
focus
on
providing
evidence
for
use
in
a
criminal
case
are
not
present,
and
the
information
has,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
a
unique
probative
value
that's
very
different
from
the
kind
of
submission
of
an
affidavit
or
submitting
to
a
civil
law
deposition
that
prompted
the
confrontation
right.
the
framers
were
thinking
about
things
that
we
all
would
recognize
as
testimony,
being
deposed,
submitting
an
affidavit,
appearing
before
a...
a
magistrate
in
a
pretrial
proceeding,
and
they
used
the
word
witness
in
the
confrontation
clause
not
only
to
refer
to
the
kinds
of
statements
that
were
covered,
but
in
connection
with
knowledge
that
the
same
word
appears
in
the
fifth
amendment
and
in
the
sixth
amendment
compulsory
process
clause,
where
in
all
of
those
contexts,
its
most
natural
application
is
to
the
formal
acquisition
of
evidence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
what's
really
striking,
justice
breyer,
is
that
there
is
no
17th
century
case
law
that
reflects
that.
there's
really
a
virtual,
complete
absence
on
the
other
side
of
this
case
of
an
affirmative
argument
supported
by
decided
cases
that
says
that
evidence
of
that
character
was
even
known
to
the
framers,
let
alone
excluded.
if
you
look
closely
at
their
constable
cases,
which
is
the
closest
cases
that
they...
they
submit,
one
of
them
is
a
report
from
the
old
bailey
online
source
which
contains
transcripts
of
criminal
trials
in...
in
england,
and
one
of
them,
the
radbourne
case,
is
right
around
the
time
of
the
framing,
and
there's
a
little
line
in
the
transcript
where
the
constable
says,
well,
i
bent
down
and
i
asked
the
victim
something
and
then
the
judge
says,
well,
don't
say
that.
there's
no
evidence
that
that
was
regarded
as
a...
a
legal
ruling
under
confrontation
principles.
there's
no
evidence
that
the
framers
were
aware
of
that
radbourne
old
bailey
report,
and
there's
additional
statutory
basis
in
the
treason
statute,
which
was
applicable
there,
which
said
that
all
evidence
had
to
be
given
face
to
face.
so
that's
their
primary
authority.
their
next
authority--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
we
have--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
hue
and
cry
reports,
justice
scalia,
as
i
think
your
earlier
questioning
suggested,
do
not
necessarily
involve
the
kind
of
emergency
situation
what...
that
we
have
here
where
a
person
is
reaching
out
from
an
ongoing
present
criminal
act
against
them
and
seeking
help.
and
the
fact
that
we
have
very
little
evidence
at
all
of
how
17th
century
british
law
handled
this
is
really,
i
think,
persuasive
evidence
that
the
court
should
not
deem
the
confrontation
right
as
a
response
to
some
sort
of
abuses
in
this
area.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
first
of
all,
there
is
evidence
that
the
hue
and
cry
practice
existed.
there
is
not
evidence
about
how
hue
and
cry
reports
were
viewed
as
a
matter
of
evidence
law.
it
is
very
difficult
to
transpose
into
17th
and
18th
century
english
practice
what
we
are
dealing
with
now,
in
part
because
the
system
of
public
prosecutions
that
we
have
today
where
an
official
prosecutor
representing
the
state
carries
the
ball
in
a
criminal
case
did
not
exist.
the
accuser
had
to
appear
in
court
as
the
private
prosecutor.
if
the
accuser
did
not
appear,
there
was
no
prosecution,
and
these
prosecutions
were
simply
dismissed
because
there
was
no
one
official
on
the
scene
to
carry
the
ball.
so
the...
the
speculation
that's
required
requires
a
number
of
inferential
leaps
that
petitioners
have
to
make
in
order
to
draw
an
analogy.
and
at
the
same
time,
there
really
is
an
intuitive
difference
between
the
kinds
of
statements
that
people
make
in
emergencies
and
the
kind
of
core
testimonial
statements
that
we
know
prompted
the
confrontation
right,
the
sir
walter
raleigh
case
involving
affidavits
and
letters,
the
marian
practice
under
which
testimony
was
formally
taken
in
the
calm
of
a
magistrate's
rooming
house
rather
than
in
the
immediate
aftermath
or
time
when
a
crime
was
actually
ongoing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
sense
that
it's
information
that's
needed
to
respond
to
and
resolve
the
imminent
threat
to
this
woman's
safety,
which
would
certainly
occur
if
the
individual
decided
to
come
back
and
finish
what
he'd
started.
and
if
a
law
enforcement
authority
set
up
its
911
calls
so
as
not
to
gather
adequate
information
and
this
individual
had
come
back
and
actually
beaten
or
killed
the
victim,
it
would
certainly
be
regarded
as
an
inadequate
response
to
the
emergency
situation
of
an
ongoing
violent
attack.
and
so
for
that
reason,
the
rule
that
we're
describing
here
for
the
court
would
deal
with
not
only
the
present
emergency
but
also
its
imminent,
threatened
recurrence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
my...
my
view
on
that
is
that
the
kinds
of
statements
that
are
made
in
the
immediate
report
of
a
crime
are
really
in
the
form
of
excited
utterances
that
are
much
different
from
the
kind
of
dispassionate
testimony
that
occurs
after
the
fact
that
prompted
the
confrontation
right.
now,
the
court
could
accept
that
line
and
say
that
jewelry
thief
reports
are
not
testimony
within
the
meaning
of
the
confrontation
clause,
or
it
could
disagree
and
say
that
no,
when
there's
not
the
immediate
threatened,
imminent
potential
for
a
recurrence
of
the
violence,
then
we're
going
to
treat
that
as
closer
to
simply
a
report
of
a
crime
and
treat
it
as
testimonial.
the
court
could
go
either
way
on
that
without
touching
the
core
of
what's
at
issue
today,
which
is
namely
emergency
situations
that
pose
a
threat
to
the
safety
of
the
person
who's
making
the
call
or
who's
encountered
by
a
law
enforcement
officer
on
the
scene
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
an
attack.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
more
that
the...
the
questioning
begins
to
delve
into
a
past
narrative
of
past
criminal
activity,
the
more
there
is
a
reason
to
think
that
it
serves,
in
addition
to
its
protection
purpose,
an
evidentiary
purpose.
i'd
hasten
to
add,
justice
scalia,
that
that
kind
of
information
is
very
important
for
the
officers
to
know
to
gauge
the
seriousness
of
the
threat,
to
get
the
kind
of
idea
of
who
they
are
dealing
with,
and
to
respond
effectively.
so
it
is
reasonably
necessary
for
those
kinds
of
questions
and
that
information
to
be
elicited.
but
i
also
agree
with
your
honor's
suggestion
that
not
everything
that
occurs
in
a
911
call
should
be
regarded
as
per
se
non
testimonial.
not
everything
that
happens
at
the
scene
of
a
crime
should
be
regarded
as
per
se
non
testimonial.
and
naturally,
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
apply
a
certain
degree
of
analysis
to
the
actual
questions
and
answers
that
are
given.
but
if
you
look
at
the
protocol
in
this
case
for
the
911
call,
if
you
look
at
the
kinds
of
questions
that
were
asked
and
the
information
that
was
given,
it
is
all
reasonably
necessary
to
resolve
an
emergency
by
a
person
who
has
really
called
in
a
state
of
extreme
stress.
