mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
michelle
mccottry's
statements
here
were
testimonial
for
the
simple
reason
that
she
knowingly
told
a
governmental
agent
associated
with
law
enforcement
that
someone
had
committed
a
crime.
prosecutions
based
on
such
ex
parte
statements
in
place
of
live
testimony
strike
at
the
very
heart
of
the
evil
the
confrontation
clause
is
designed
to
prevent,
trials
on
the
basis
of
out
of
court
accusations.
indeed,
the
trial
here
really
can't
be
described
as
anything
other
than
inquisitorial
in
nature.
the
sole
proof
that
mr.
davis
was
at
ms.
mccottry's
house
and
assaulted
her
that
day
was
the
4-minute,
tape
recorded
911
police
incident
interview
that
the
state
played
at
mr.
davis'
trial
and
that
it
itself
described
as
ms.
mccottry's
testimony
on
the
day
this
happened.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
answer
one
way
or
another
whether
it's
testimonial.
what
it
does
and
what
i'm
trying
to
do
for
this
court
is,
first,
draw
back
the
lens
for
a
moment
and
look
at
the
kind
of
trial
that
we
end
up
with
when
statements
of
the...
like
fresh
accusations
in
this
case,
are
able
to
be
used
in
place
of
live
testimony.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
let...
let
me
address
that
question
in
two
parts.
the
first
part
you've
mentioned,
justice
ginsburg,
is
whether
it
matters
that
the...
that
the
operator
is
not
a
police
officer,
and
we
submit
no.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
see.
well,
we
don't
believe,
under
the
proper
conception
of
the
confrontation
clause,
it
matters
who
the
accusatory
statement
is
initiated
by.
certainly
we
believe
the
confrontation
clause
should
apply
if
ms.
mccottry
had
simply
walked
out
of
her
house
and
walked
down
the
street
to
the
police
station
and
voluntarily
walked
into
the
sheriff's
office
and
said,
i
want
to
report
what
mr.
davis
just
did.
what
we...
what
we
suggest
here
today
is
there's
no
difference
if
she
simply
calls
on
the
telephone
to
a
911
operator,
which
the
state
itself
in
its
brief
calls
a
conduit
to
the
police,
and
so
when
the...
when
the
police
and
when
the
state
have
set
up
a
system
for
people
to
report
calls
more
expeditiously...
i'm
sorry...
report
crimes
more
expeditiously,
we
don't
think
the
answer
is
any
different.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
there...
in...
in
a
sense,
of
course,
ms.
mccottry
is
seeking
help
at
the
same
time
she's
reporting
a
crime,
but
the...
the
mere
fact
that
the
two
are
intertwined
does
not
take
us
outside
the
confrontation
clause.
of
course,
in
the
indiana
case
that
you're
going
to
hear,
you're
going
to
hear
the
same
thing,
that
the
person
is
asking
for
help
in
the
same
way.
so
when
somebody
makes
a
call,
which
we
might
call
a
mixed
motive
or
a
dual
purpose
call,
the
question
that
we
think
this
court
should
ask
is
whether...
whether
that's
the
kind
of
a
statement,
first
of
all,
that
historically
would
have
been
viewed
as
implicating
the
confrontation
clause.
and
if
you
look
at
the
hue...
the
old
hue
and
cry
practice
that
we've
referred
to
in
our
briefs,
sir
matthew
hale
in
his
treatise
explains
that
when
somebody
went
and
got
the
local
constable,
what
they
were
doing
is
they
were
seeking
help,
first
and
foremost,
to
apprehend
a
felon,
and
more
than
that,
they
were
also
reporting
the
crime
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
you
certainly
don't
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case,
your
honor,
but...
but
we
believe--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--certainly
any
statement
describing
criminal
activity
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
would
be
testimonial.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
purpose
of
the
hearsay
rule,
justice
breyer,
is
to
police
the
reliability
of
out
of
court
statements.
what
this
court
said
in
crawford
is
the
confrontation
clause
is
something
much
different.
it
regulates
the
manner
of
taking
testimony
in
criminal
trials.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
we
believe
the
rule
is,
is
that
any
accusatory
statement
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
or
to
an
agent
of
the
law...
of
law
enforcement--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
history
of
the
confrontation
right,
going
back
even
prior
to
the
framer,
was
to
bring
the
accuser
and
the
accused
face
to
face
so
that
the
accuser
made
his
or
her
accusation
in
the
presence
of
the
accused
and
subject
to
cross
examination.
and
the
very
heart
of
the
confrontation
clause,
which
this
court
has
said
itself
over
and
over
again
is
to
require
the
accuser
to...
to
deliver
the
accusation
in
court,
and
so
accusatory
statements,
those
that
say
he
did
it,
this
is
what
happened,
this
is
what
i
saw,
are
different
than
ordinary
hearsay.
and...
and
i...
to
take
an
example
from...
that
we
talked
about
in
the
crawford
argument,
justice
breyer,
when
somebody
says
pass
the...
pass
the
pewter
urn
from
the
mantle,
that's
where
bob
keeps
the
drugs,
that's
the
kind
of
a
statement
that
is
very
different
than
pointing
the
finger
at
somebody
to
a
law
enforcement
agent.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
absolutely,
justice
scalia,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
does,
and
what
i'm
giving
you
is
a...
a
rule
that
i
think
is
the
kernel,
the
heart
of
the
confrontation
right.
you
don't
have
to
say
much
more
than
that
if
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that
statements
law
enforcement
officer
merely
overhear
may
not
be
testimonial,
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
this
court's
bourjaily
decision,
which
it
cited
with
approval
in
crawford,
is
if
somebody
make...
if
somebody
makes
statements
that
tend
out...
that
turn
out
to
be
incriminating
in
a
criminal
case,
the
mere
fact
that
they're
overheard
by
law
enforcement
officers
or
even
an
undercover
officer
eliciting
the
statement
is
in
a
different
scenario,
mr.
chief
justice,
than
somebody
making
a
statement
to
law
enforcement
or
even...
and
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
hypothetical.
if
the
person
realized
that
a
police
officer
was
standing
there
and
hearing
what
she
was
telling
her
neighbor,
we
may
then
have
a
testimonial
situation.
but
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
not
simply
a
blurting
out
or
a
cry
for
help.
in
fact,
ms.
mccottry
never
asked
for
help.
she
said
she
didn't
need
an
aid
car.
what
we
have
are
a
series
of
26
questions
that
the
911
operator
asked
ms.
mccottry
that
established
every
element
of
the
crime
the
court...
i'm
sorry...
that
the
state
ultimately
proved.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
a
fair
inference,
justice
scalia.
of
course,
we
don't
know
because
she
was
never...
she's
never
herself
submitted
to
cross
examination.
but
there
are
mandatory
arrest
laws
in
the
state
of
washington.
she
had
a
no
contact
order
against
mr.
davis,
both
of
which
a
reasonable
person
would
understand
that
a
call
for
911
would
be
tantamount
to
a
call
for
arrest.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it's
about
4
minutes,
justice
ginsburg.
and
it's
not...
what
we
submit
is...
of
course,
we've
given
you
in
the
joint
appendix
the
structured
protocol
that
the
911
operator
was
following
in
this
case,
and
we
submit
that
it's
not
mere
happenstance
that
the
911
call
was
able
to
establish
every
element
of
the
crime,
right
down
to
mr.
davis'
birth
date
that
the
prosecutor
referred
to
in
her
closing
argument
that
the
911
operator
elicited
from
ms.
mccottry.
and,
indeed,
the
only
question--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
may
be,
and
that
may
be
another
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
a...
of
a--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
want
to
dispute
that
911
operators
in
this
situation,
just
like
responding
officers,
are
gathering
information
for
dual
purposes.
they
may
well
be
trying
to
resolve
an
ongoing
threat
of
a
felon
at
large.
at
the
same
time,
of
course,
all
of
the
information
and
training
manuals
that
we've
provided
to
you
in
the
reply
brief
make
it
clear
that
from
the
initial
contact
with
the
alleged
victim,
they
are
gathering
evidence
all
the
while.
and
in
fact,
the
only
thing
you
can
think
of...
at
least,
i
can't
think
of
a
single
question
that
a
prosecutor
might
have
asked
at
a
trial
that
the
911
operator
didn't
ask
here.
the
only
questions
that
really
immediately
come
to
mind
are
ones
that
might
have
been
asked
in
cross
examination.
for
example--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--to
the
extent
that
the
person
is
saying
someone
is
attacking
me,
that
kernel
may...
may
well
be
testimonial,
justice
alito.
however,
if
somebody
calls
911
and
says,
please
send
help
to
911
main...
or
3312
main
street,
that
may
well
not
be
testimonial.
and
that...
a
mere
cry
for
help...
and
this
goes
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
as
well.
a
simple
cry
for
help
may...
may
not
be
testimonial.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
a
fair
inference,
but
the...
the
priority
attention,
in
terms
of
going
and
apprehending
mr.
davis,
is
exactly
what
triggers
criminal
justice
system
and
exactly
what
makes
the
kind
of
a
statement,
the
one
that
the...
one
that
the
confrontation
clause
should
care
about.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i'm
not
sure
it's
easy
to
separate
one
from
the
other,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
way
that
they
are
doing
that
is
by
arresting
him.
they
have
a
mandatory
arrest
law
in
washington
that
says
that
the
way
that
the
police
must
respond
to
a
call
like
this
is
to
arrest--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
justice
stevens.
it's
our
view
that
you
really
ought
not
be
looking
or
focusing
on
the
police
officer
motive
or
on
the
governmental
agent's
motive
for
the
very
reason
that
you
start
to
get
into
these
knotty
questions
of
what
exactly
were
they
trying
to
accomplish.
and
we
believe
the
better...
a
better
default
than...
if
you
can't
simply
answer
it
by
looking
at
history
and
precedent,
is
to
look
more
towards
the
declarant's
reasonable
expectation.
and
that's
what
this
court
does
in
the
fifth
amendment
when
it--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
latter--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
latter
is
a
very
close
case,
justice
souter.
i
think
you're
right
insofar
as
it...
it
can
be
important
to
distinguish
between
a
modern
day
excited
utterance
and
what
would
have
been
considered
a
res
gestae
type
statement
at
common
law.
certainly
if
you
take
away
the
911
call
from
your
hypothetical
and
she
says,
please
don't
hurt
me,
adrian,
that
may
well
be
the
kind
of
a
statement
that
would
be
inside
the
res
gestae.
once
somebody
picks
up
the
phone
to
call
911,
that,
by
my
reading
of
the
historical
cases,
turns
it
into
a
report
or
a
narrative.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
we
believe
that
as
long
as
it
is
making
a
report
to
a
third
party,
there
ought
not
be
a
distinction.
now,
of
course,
you
don't
have
to
wrestle
with
that
in
this
case
because--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
justice
scalia,
of
course,
we
didn't
have
telephone
technology,
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
for
two
reasons,
justice
scalia.
one
is
we
do
have
the
hue
and
cry
scenario
that
we've
talked
about.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
and
we
think
the
fair--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it's
not
exactly
on
all
fours
with
this
case,
but
we
think
the
fair
inference,
when
you
read
the
treatises
and
the
reasons
why
those
kinds
of
statements
were
kept
out,
is
that
if
they
simply...
if
the
police
or
their
agents
were
able
to
get
the
statement
just
a
little
bit
sooner,
the
answer
would
have
been
the
same.
and
we
do
have
cases,
justice
scalia,
where
people
made
fresh
accusations
or
cry
outs
to
private
parties
to...
to
another...
to
a
witness
who
wasn't
even
associated
with
law
enforcement,
and
we
have
a
whole
section
of
our
brief
pointing
out
that
for
decades
after
the
founding,
even
those
kinds
of
statements
were
kept
out
of
evidence
in
criminal
trials
for
the
reason--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i...
i
think
it's
a
fair
inference,
justice
scalia,
from
reading
the
historical
precedent
and
the
treatises
that
describe
it.
they...
they
describe
these
as,
in...
in
a
sense,
second
class
testimony.
they
say
the
problem
with
statements
like
this,
if
they're
made
even
seconds
after
the
event
in
place,
is
that
they're...
at
that
point
they're
nothing
more
than
a
narrative
and
require
us
to
give
credit
to
a
statement...
and
this
is
the
words
the
treatise
writers
used
to
use...
that
was
not
given
under
the
ordinary
tests
for
determining
the
accuracy
of
testimony.
and
when
they
used
the
word
like
testimony
and
they
talk
about
the
usual
tests
and
the
customary
way
of
testing
out
of
court
statements,
i
think
the
fair
inference
is
they're
referring
to
the
right
to
confrontation.
perhaps
another
way
to
think
about
this
is
to
take
a
step
back
and
say,
what
if
we
decide
that
statements
like
this
are
not
testimonial?
the
practical...
the
practical
impact
of
that
is
not
simply
that
these
statements
won't...
will
come
in,
but
that
prosecutors
and...
prosecutors,
federal
and
state
government,
will
have
no
incentive
whatsoever
to
ever
bring
911
callers
into
court.
it...
it
is...
across
state
hearsay
law
across
the
country,
these
are
deemed
excited
utterances.
so
if
this
court
were
to
say--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
you
got
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
when
you
said
that
if
it's
a
good
witness,
the
prosecutor
will
put
them
on.
the
flip
side
of
that
is
that
if
the
witness
isn't
so
good,
the
prosecutor
would
have
every
incentive
at
least
not
to
put
them
on
the
stand.
why
would
somebody
put
on
a
stand...
put
somebody
on
a
stand
that
doesn't
seem
perhaps
credible
or
maybe
subject
to
impeachment
when
they
have,
in
a
sense,
testimony
in
a
sealed
tape
recorder
already?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
the
defendant--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
defendant
might
be
able
to
do
that.
but,
of
course,
that
would...
treating
the
case
this
way
would
collapse
the
confrontation
right
into
the
compulsory
process
clause.
the
confrontation
right
is
a
right
not
to
be
able
to
bring
witnesses
into
court.
it's
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
your
assumption
may
not
be
entirely
correct.
there's
a...
there's
a
portion
from,
for
example,
the
san
diego
prosecutor's
office
decided,
and
i
believe
in
the
nacdl
brief,
that
says
oftentimes
they
do
prefer
to...
to
leave
the
witness
off
the
stand
because
they
have
a
better
case
just
using
the...
the
excited
utterance
type
statements.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
and
perhaps...
and
this
gets
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
well.
it
helps
maybe
to
separate
these
kinds
of
cases
into
three
categories.
we
first
have
the
category
that
the
prosecution
would
prefer
not
to
put
the
person
on
the
stand.
we
think
there
the
confrontation
clause
ought
to
require
them
to
do
so.
we...
we
next
have
the
category
where
the
defendant,
as
you
say,
procures
the
witness'
absence.
we
don't
dispute
that
in
that
scenario
the
forfeiture
doctrine
kicks
in,
which
this
court
reaffirmed
in
crawford.
we
don't
have
any
forfeiture
question
in
this
case.
and
then
we
have
perhaps
the
gray
area,
where
a
witness
goes
missing
through
no
fault
of
anybody's,
and
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
there
the
confrontation
right
puts
the
onus
onto
the
prosecution.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
want
to
be
insensitive
to...
to
witnesses
in
this
situation.
of
course,
reluctant
witnesses
is
nothing
new,
but...
but
in
domestic
violence,
it's
an
acute
problem.
however,
we
believe
the
proper
way
to
deal
with
that
situation
is
by
this
court
developing
its
forfeiture
doctrine.
the
sixth
amendment
applies
across
the
board
to
all
criminal
cases,
justice
ginsburg,
and
we've
cited,
for
example,
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
about
30
cases
from
the
last
couple
years
that
have
been
handled
in
a
victimless
fashion
like
this
that
are
not
domestic
violence
cases--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
that's
already
what
happens
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
and
under
the
evidence
of
many
states,
that
there
is
a
rule
of
forfeiture
by
wrongdoing.
and
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
not--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
we
have...
justice
breyer,
like
in
lots
of
other
scenarios,
you
have
a
pretrial
hearing,
and
at
that
pretrial
hearing,
of
course,
the
rules
of
evidence
don't
strictly
apply
the
way
they
would
in
the
guilt
phase.
so
in
this
very
case,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
when...
when
on
the
eve
of
trial
ms.
mccottry
is
no
longer
going
to
show
up
for
trial,
the
prosecutor
says,
i
want
to
subpoena
the
jail
records
and
i
want
to
talk
to
the
victim's
advocate
to
find
out
whether
she's
been
intimidated
or
kept
away.
so
the
prosecutor
herself
tells
the
court
how
she's
going
to
look
for
this
evidence.
if
she
had
found
anything,
presumably
she
would
have
presented
it
and
she
could
have
presented
it
that
way.
and
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
of
course,
justice
scalia,
the
sixth
amendment
says
all
criminal
prosecutions--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--and
domestic
violence
cases
are
criminal
prosecutions.
so
we
don't
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right,
but
we--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
a
fair
comment.
and
let...
let
me
say
there
are
two...
there
are
many
ways
that
you
can
do
that,
justice
scalia,
and
two
of
them
were
readily
available
to
the
state
in
this
case.
one
is
even
when
a
witness
goes
missing
or
is
unwilling
to
testify
in
a
hard
case,
there
may
well
be
other
ways
to
prove
the
case.
here,
the
caller
said--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
justice
breyer,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--let
me
give
you
two
ways
this
case,
if...
if
we
assume
the
state's
version
of
the
events
is
correct,
could
have
easily
been
proved.
one
is
that
the
caller
said
that
a
man
named
mike
was
at
her
house
during
the
entire
event.
when
the
police
showed
up
at
her
house
some
5
minutes
later,
they
never
even
got
mike's
last
name.
and,
of
course,
justice
breyer,
the
reason
why
is
because
they
were
probably
thinking
of
the
roberts
framework
and
that
they
wouldn't
need
this
witness,
but
good
old
fashioned
police
work
would
have
presumably
found
a
witness
that
witnessed
the
whole
event
that
they
could
have
put
on
the
stand.
the
second
thing
the
state
could
have
done
in
this
case
is
they
could
have
filed
the
case
in
a
way
that
they
obtained
a
preliminary
hearing.
if
what
the
state
says
is
correct
that
ms.
mccottry
was
cooperating
up
until
the
last
minute,
that's
a
classic
scenario
where,
by
way
of
having
a
preliminary
hearing
and
subjecting
her
to
cross
examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
they
could
have
preserved
her
testimony.
this
court
in
california
against
green
and
roberts
itself
said
that
those
kinds
of
prior
pretrial
cross
examination
scenarios
are
good
enough
to
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause.
and
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
record
and
then
two
things
about
the
emergency
exception
that
we've
been
talking
about.
first,
in
the
record
it's
always
been
accepted
in
this
case
that
mr.
davis
had
left
the
house
when
the
911
call
started.
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
117,
that's
what
the
washington
supreme
court
said,
and
at
page
30
of
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
trial
court,
the
prosecutor
submitted
the
case
that
way
as
well.
now
let
me
address
the
history
here
because
it's
important.
and
justice
scalia
is
exactly
right.
there's
not
a
single
case
historically
where
a
statement
to
a
law
enforcement
agent
accusing
someone
of
a
crime
was
admitted
in
a
criminal
case.
we're
not
aware
of
one.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it...
it
is
what
it
is,
justice
breyer.
the...
the
oldest
case
that
is
in
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
is
white
v.
illinois
in
1992.
so
for
some
500
years
before
that.
and...
and
perhaps
when
we
have
to
draw
an
inference,
we
do
have...
to
a
certain
degree
we
acknowledge
the
dog
that
doesn't
bark.
we
have
evidence
that
was
out
there
and
simply
wasn't
used.
let's
look
at
the
history
of
the
marian
statutes.
and
i'm...
and
i
want
to
refer
the
specifically
to
page
101
of
sir
matthew
hale's
treatise.
he
talks
about
the...
both
the
problem
with
the
hue
and
cry
and
then
the
reason
we
have
the
marian
statutes.
the
reason
we
have
the
marian
statutes
was
because
for
pretrial
bail
and
committal
hearings,
the
courts
were
not
prepared
to
simply
go
on
the
initial
reports.
they
wanted
a
formal
examination
of
the
witness
to
use
at
even
the
pretrial
hearing,
to
detain
the
person
pending
trial.
and
sir
matthew
hale
at
page
101
says
the
problem
with
the
fresh
reports
of
the
hue
and
cry,
is
that...
is
that
they're
not
under
oath.
they
don't...
they
don't
even
answer
all
the
questions
that
we
would
want
answered.
so
what
the
united
states
is
asking
you
to
accept
is
that
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
framers
would
not
have
even
been
prepared
to
allow
at
a
pretrial
bail
hearing...
rather,
they
wanted
to
have
something
more
formal...
they
would
now
accept
to
be
used
in
the
trial
itself.
and
what
we
think
is
that
this
turns
everything
on
its
head.
the
reason
the
marian
statutes
were
abused
is
because,
of
course,
in
continental
europe
that
was
an
accepted
form
of
evidence,
and
so
there
was
some
reason
to
believe
these
formal
statements
could
be
used.
no
one
ever
suggested
that
hue
and
cry
could
be
used.
finally,
let
me
say
a
word
about
police
incentives.
if
you
accept
the
rule
that
the...
that
the
united
states
and...
and
the
state
is
asking
you
to
accept,
think
about
the
incentives
you
put
on
911
operators.
they're
not
supposed
to
ask
too
many
questions.
they're
not
supposed
to
get
too
much
information.
the
same
would
go
for
the
responding
officer.
they
don't
want
to
ask
too
many
questions,
structured
questions,
make
sure
who
did
it,
make
sure
they
have
the
details
because
then
somehow
these
statements
become
testimonial.
what
our
rule
says
is
it
frees
the
911
operator,
it
frees
the
police
officers
to
do
what
they're
supposed
to
do,
which
is
immediately
start
responding
and
both
help
people
and
start
gathering
evidence
from
the
moment
that
a
crime
is
reported.
and
that's
what
we
think
the
confrontation
clause
is
all
about.
it's
not...
it's
about
the
way
the
case
is
proved
at
trial.
the
confrontation
clause...
as
opposed
to
other
emergency
doctrines
this
court
has
in
the
fourth
amendment
area,
for
example,
the
confrontation
clause
has
zero
to
say
about
the
way
police
officers
do
their
jobs
or
the
way
the
911
operators
do
their
jobs.
if
they
go
out
and
collect
structured
affidavits
under
oath,
that
the
911
operator
put
the
caller
under
oath,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
if
the
911
operator
says,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
this
right,
describe
to
me
exactly
what
he
looks
like,
and
tell
me
more
about
him,
that's
what
we
would
want
somebody
to
do.
and
we
shouldn't
put
a
perverse
incentive
for
these
first
responders
that,
all
of
a
sudden,
once
they
start
gathering
useful
information
for
the
criminal
justice
system,
that
some
sort
of
new
rule
triggers.
all
we're
saying
is
that
these
are
the
kinds
of
statements
that
were...
that
the
framers
would
have
cared
about
and
that
they
did
care
about,
and
that
nowadays
if
the
state
or
other
prosecutors
want
to
use
them,
they
should
be
duty
bound
to
bring
the
witness
into
court
as
well
to
submit
the
witness
to
cross
examination.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
this
court
noticed
that
professor
wigmore
had
the
view
that
the
confrontation
clause
applied
only
to
witnesses
that
actually
took
the
stand.
so
he
would
have
thought
the
confrontation
clause
didn't
apply
at
all.
but
he
would
have
acknowledged
to
you...
and
this
is
interesting
from
his
treatise...
that
these
were
testimonial
statements.
he
said
as
soon
as
somebody
starts...
as
soon
as
in
a
criminal
trial
we
use
a
statement
narrating
a
past
event,
it's
testimonial.
however,
professor
wigmore
just
didn't
quite
have
the
confrontation
clause
right.
