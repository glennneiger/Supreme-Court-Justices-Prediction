justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
started
out
by
saying
that
the
purpose
of
the
confrontation
clause
was
to
keep
out
the
accusations
made
out
of
court,
but
i
would
have
thought
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
hearsay
rule.
and
if
that's
the
purpose
of
the
hearsay
rule,
how
does
the
confrontation
clause
differ?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
so
it's
not
the
purpose
of
the
confrontation
clause
to
keep
out
out
of
court
accusations.
only
some,
and
which,
and
what's
the
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
do
believe
that,
but
i
want
to
know
why
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
not
the
hearsay--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--rather
the
confrontation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
would
you
do
that?
how
would
you
do
that
forfeiture?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
would
you
do
that?
i'm
interested
in
that
because
i
thought
it
sounded
good.
then
i
thought
about
it.
i
thought
to
have
forfeiture,
you'd
have
to
show
that
this
defendant,
in
fact,
forced
the
wife
not
to
testify.
it's
a
crime
to
do
that.
so
you'd
have
to
prove
another
crime
against
the
defendant
in
order
to
prove
the
first
crime.
and
i
thought
perhaps
that
doctrine
is
not
very
practical.
you
tell
me
why
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
my
point
is
that
to
prove
the
wrongdoing
would
probably
be
even
harder
than
to
prove
the
original
crime.
all
we
know
is
the
wife
isn't
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
suspect
that
she's
afraid
of
her
husband.
he
may
have
offered
to
cut
off
financial
aid,
said
goodbye,
no
money,
or
he
may
have
done
worse.
i'm
just
saying
you're
telling
us
that
because
the
prosecution
can
prove
that
in
court
and
only
then
will
it
be
able
to
introduce
the
testimony
given
beforehand
by
the
missing
wife.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
true,
but
the
reason
i
thought
spousal
abuse
cases
are
relevant--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
reason
i
thought
they
were
relevant
is
just
what
you're
about
to
address.
they're
evidentiary
of
the
problem
that
exists
when
you
bring
something
within
the
confrontation
clause.
prior
to
crawford,
even
though
it
was
within
the
clause,
if
it
fell
within
a
well
recognized
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule,
it
could
come
in.
so
you
could
bring
in
co
conspirators
before
the
conspiracy
ended.
you
could
bring
in,
for
sure,
excited
utterances.
you
could
bring
in
all
kinds
of
things
that
now,
no
matter
how
reliable,
you
have
to
keep
them
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
that
is
a
problem
that
you
have
to
address
in
respect
to
drawing
a
fairly
narrow
line,
and
i
want
to
know
what
that
narrow
line
is
with
spousal
abuse
and
other
cases
in
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
say
in
that
respect
about
the
blue
brief's
reference
to
17th
century
cases,
the
hue
and
the
cry
where
someone
went
out
and
told
the
sheriff,
help,
i'm
being
beaten
up,
and
that
that
evidence
wasn't
admissible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
rather
than
build
that
into
the
law,
it
might
be
wiser
to
deal
with
justice
kennedy's
case,
in
whatever
system
we
come
up
with,
explaining
it.
so
what
is
your
full
explanation
of
the
diamond
necklace?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be
hearsay.
that
may
all
be
hearsay.
