justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
this
question
about
the
plain
language?
if
the
word
in
1(f)(1)(a)
had
not
been
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
of
sale...
sale
of
security.
"
had
been
"in
connection
with
his
or
her
purchase
or
sale.
"
then
it
would
have
been
covered,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
question
is
whether
we
should
construe
the
word
"the"
to
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
"his
or
her".
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
that's
a
normal
reading
of
the
word,
so
that
you...
when
you
say
a
purchase
or...
it
normally
would
be
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities
by
the
party
that
litigates.
"
and
that
would
be
your
first
take
on
it.
but
then
you
say,
"well,
we
have
cases
out
there
that
construe
it
a
little
more
narrowly.
"
and
this
is
not
somewhat
unusual...
and
i
know
it's
not
totally
unusual...
for
congress
to
preempt
a
state
cause
of
action
that
without...
where
there
is
no
parallel
federal
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
preempts
class
actions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
going
through
that
legislative
history,
did
you
find
any
evidence
that
they
intended
to
preempt
any
state
law
claims
that
were
not...
did
not
have
a
parallel
federal
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
other
than
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
brought
up
the
legislative
history.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you're
an
expert
on
that
subject.
[laughter]
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hungar,
i
just
wonder
if
that's
correct.
is...
am
i
not
right
to
say
that
the
word
"the"
had
been
read
to
mean
"his
or
her",
that
argument
would
not
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you
don't
have
to
have
differing
interpretations
of
"in
connection
with".
you
just
have
to
know
what
the
word
"the"
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
certainly
doesn't
require
the
commission
to
be
a
purchaser
or
seller,
either.
you
know--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
would
be
at...
adjudged
under
a
different
standard,
you're
dead
right.
as
far
as
the
parties
involved,
the...
that's
what
i
was
really
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frederick,
you
mentioned
cutting
off
a
whole
category
of
claims.
and,
earlier,
you
said
they
didn't
want
to
give
a
pass
to
this
kind
of
claim.
but
this
is
not
a
pass,
because
there
are
all
sorts
of
remedies
retained...
derivative
suits,
49-person
actions,
and
so
forth.
and
are
you
aware...
you
mentioned
the
100
years
of
state
precedent...
is
there
any
precedent
in
the
state
law
for
class
actions
for
holder
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
not
a
case
where
we
have
a
100-year
body
of
law
of
class
action
after
class
action
brought
on
state
law
grounds
for
this
type
of
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you're
describing
the
present
importance
of
the...
that.
but
i
don't
think
you've
answered
my
question
about
historic...
as
a
matter
of
history,
we
don't
have
a
history
of
timer
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
frederick,
can
i
ask
sort
of
a
background
question?
ever
since
blue
chip...
it's
been
on
the
books
for
a
long
time...
has
congress
ever
considered
legislation
that
would
expand
the
10(b)(5)
private
remedy
to
include
holder
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not,
either.
i...
just
wondering
if
there
was
some
we
could--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
blue--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
blue
chip
did
not
adopt
the
rationale
of
the
birnbaum
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whether
the
sec
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
blue
chip?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
took
the
position
that
the
seventh
circuit
took
in
eason,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frederick,
i
want
to
be
sure
of
one
question.
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
argument
about
how
the
district
court
has
to
deny
the
right
to
the
sec.
but
the
sec
wouldn't
be
bound
by
the
district
court's
decision,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
sec
could
relitigate
it,
i
would
think.
it
wouldn't
be
bound
by
the
judgment
in
a
private
suit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
surprising
that
the
holder
claims
didn't
respond
to
blue
chip.
i
think
your
argument
would
suggest
they
should
have
responded
to
blue
chip
by
bringing
a
whole
host
of
holder
claims
in
the
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit.
we
granted
review
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
the
2nd
and
7th
circuits
over
the
extent
to
which
the
securities
litigation
uniform
standards
act
of
1998
preempts
plaintiffs
from
bringing
certain
class
actions
under
state
law.
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
a
former
merrill
lynch
broker
who
brought
a
class
action
under
oklahoma
law,
alleging
that
merrill
lynch
had
breached
state-law
duties
that
it
owed
to
its
brokers
by
disseminating
research,
misleading
research
and
thereby
manipulating
stock
prices.
his
complaint
encompassed
what
are
known
as
holder
claims,
claims
that
the
brokers
were
injured
because
they
continued
to
hold
their
stocks
long
beyond
the
point
when,
had
the
truth
been
known,
they
would
have
sold.
these
holder
claims
are
different
from
claims
brought
by
purchasers
or
sellers
alleging
a
particular
transaction
of
purchase
or
sale
was
wrongfully
induced.
the
federal
district
court
dismissed
the
case,
concluding
that
it
was
preempted
by
the
1998
act,
which
provides
that
no
covered
class
action
based
upon
state
law
and
alleging
a
misrepresentation
or
omission
of
a
material
fact
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
covered
security
may
be
maintained
in
any
state
or
federal
court
by
any
private
party.
on
appeal
however,
the
2nd
circuit
reached
a
different
conclusion,
reasoning
that
holder
claims
are
not,
“in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale”,
of
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
1998
act.
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
sec
rule
10b-5
generally
prohibit
fraud
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
ever
since
1946,
federal
courts
have
recognized
a
private
federal
cause
of
action
for
damages
for
violations
of
rule
10b-5,
but
we
have
held
that
only
purchasers
or
sellers
may
invoke
that
remedy.
thus,
respondent
in
this
case
does
not
have
a
federal
remedy
for
his
alleged
injury.
on
the
other
hand,
in
enforcement
actions
initiated
by
the
sec,
we
have
broadly
construed
the
“in
connection
with”
phrase
to
encompass
a
variety
of
situations
in
which
investors
other
than
actual
purchasers
or
sellers
are
the
injured
parties.
the
1998
act
that
we
construe
today
broadly
preempts
a
large
category
of
class
actions
that
are
based
on
state
law
and
allege
fraud
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
the
question
for
decision,
then,
is
whether
the
act
only
preempts
state
law
class
actions
for
which
federal
law
provides
a
remedy,
as
the
2nd
circuit
held,
or
whether,
as
the
7th
circuit
has
held,
it
also
preempts
state-law
class
actions
for
which
there
is
no
federal
remedy.
we
conclude
that
the
broad
interpretation
of
the
“in
connection
with”
phrase
that
we
have
accepted
in
sec
enforcement
actions
is
the
meaning
that
congress
intended
in
the
1998
act.
this
conclusion
is
supported
not
only
by
the
statute’s
text,
but
also
by
the
concerns
that
led
to
its
enactment;
namely,
that
congress
believed
that
lawyers
who
were
bringing
securities
class
actions
in
state
court
were
invoking
their
state
remedies
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
complying
with
an
earlier
federal
statute
that
had
tightened
the
requirements
for
bringing
securities
class
actions
under
federal
law.
our
conclusion
is
consistent
with
the
presumption
that
congress
does
not
cavalierly
preempt
state
law
causes
of
action,
because
the
1998
act
does
not
actually
preempt
any
cause
of
action,
but
rather
merely
denies
plaintiffs
the
right
to
use
the
class-action
device
to
vindicate
a
carefully
defined
category
of
claims.
moreover,
it
is
federal
law
rather
than
state
law
that
has
long
provided
the
principle
basis
for
asserting
class-action
securities-fraud
acclaims.
thus,
this
is
by
no
means
a
case
in
which
a
federal
statute
has
eliminated
a
historically
entrenched
state-law
remedy.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
unanimous
opinion.
justice
alito
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
