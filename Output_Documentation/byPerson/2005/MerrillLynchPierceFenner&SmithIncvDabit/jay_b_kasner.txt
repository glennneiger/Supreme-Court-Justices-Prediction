mr.
jay
b.
kasner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
an
effort
to
limit
state
law
securities
class
actions
which
undermine
the
market
for
nationally
traded
securities,
congress
enacted
slusa,
a
statute
of
broad
preemption.
slusa,
which
is
reprinted
at
page
8(a)
of
petitioner's
blue
brief,
preempts,
subject
to
three
specific
statutory
extensions,
all
state
law
covered
class
actions,
quote,
"by
any
private
party
who
alleges
misrepresentations,
omissions,
or
fraudulent
behavior
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
covered
security.
"
the
second
circuit
erred
in
implying
an
exception,
that
nowhere
appears
in
the
statutory
language,
and
is
wholly
at
odds
with
the
purpose
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute
for
holders
claims,
a
type
of
claim
in
which
a
plaintiff
alleges,
"i
did
not
purchase"
or
"i
did
not
sell,
but
would
have,
had
i
known
the
allegedly
false
information.
"
a
type
of
claim
which
this
court,
in
blue
chip
stamps,
over
30
years
ago,
recognized
as
the
most
vexatious
and
abusive
type
of
securities
class
action
claims.
the
court
below
erred,
for
a
number
of
different
reasons.
first
and
foremost,
it
completely
violated
the
natural
meaning
of
the
statute.
as
i
have
mentioned,
an
examination
of
slusa,
beginning
at
page
8(a),
reflects
that
no
covered
class
action
may
be
maintained,
quote,
"by
any
private
party",
a
clause
that
this
court,
time
and
again,
has
interpreted
as
perhaps
the
broadest
way
of
phrasing
"any
and
all
private
parties"
making
certain
types
of
allegations.
those
allegations
appear
in
(a)
or
(b),
focusing
on
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
covered
security.
now,
congress
could
have...
had
it
intended
to
inject
a
purchase/seller
limitation,
consistent
with
what
the
court
below
concluded,
congress
could
have
phrased
that
language
differently.
as
the
court
is
aware,
in
the
both
the
1933
and
1934
acts,
congress
has
made
express
causes
of
action,
subject
to
an
explicit
purchase
or
seller
requirement.
for
example,
section
11
of
the
'33
act
affords
a
private
right
of
action
to
purchasers
of
securities
in
registered
offerings.
section
12
affords
a
private
right
of
action
to
persons
from
whom
an
offer
or
sale
of
securities.
section
9(e)
of
the
'34
act,
similarly,
affords
a
purchase
or
seller
requirement.
significantly,
slusa
nowhere
speaks
in
terms
of
a
purchase
or
sale.
and
it
could
have.
for
example,
congress
could
have
provided
that
no
covered
class
action
by
any
private
party
alleging
"his
or
her
sale"
of
a
covered
security
is
preempted.
it
could
have
said,
"any
private
party
alleging
a
misrepresentation
or
omission
of
a
material
fact
in
connection
with
the
plaintiff
or
that
party's
purchase
or
sale.
"
it
did
not.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
also
at
odds
with
this
court's
teaching
in
united
states
versus
o'hagan,
which
was
decided
1
year
before
slusa
was
enacted
by
congress.
in
united
states
versus
o'hagan,
this
court
concluded
that
the
so
called
"misappropriation
theory"
stated
a
viable
claim
in
a
criminal
case
brought
by
the
united
states
government.
in
responding
to
an
argument
by
the
defendant
that
no
one
involved
that
had
been
defrauded
purchased
or--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--justice
stevens,
if,
by
"his
or
her",
it's
referencing
"any
private
party",
i
would
agree
with
that.
that
would
be
a
different
case
in--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--in
essence,
justice
stevens--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
that
question
has
been
answered
by
this
court,
on
a
number
of
different
occasions.
again,
in
united
states
versus
o'hagan,
this
court
concluded
that
the
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
"
does
not
mean
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
by
another
party
to
the
securities
transaction.
"
but,
rather,
means
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
by
anyone.
"
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
it
does,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
the
point
being,
your
honor,
whether--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--yes,
your
honor.
in
adjudicatory
proceedings
referenced
in
our
brief,
the
sec
has
unanimously,
and
uniformly,
taken
the
position
that
it
does
not.
in
briefs
to
this
court
in
criminal
prosecutions,
in
civil
prosecutions,
the
government
has
consistently
taken
the
position,
as
it
has
in
this
case,
as
an
amicus,
and
as
it
did
in
the
court
below.
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
we
do
take
the
position
that
this
court
should
defer
to
the
views
of
the
sec
on
that
issue.
what
that
deference
is,
should
it
be
chevron
or
skidmore,
is
not
a
question
your
honor
has
asked.
i'm
happy
to
say
that
we
believe,
vis
a
vis
10(b)(5)--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--well,
your
honor,
i
actually
carefully
studied
yesterday's
opinion,
where
this
court
discussed
the
skidmore
deference,
and,
either
way,
we
think
that
this
is...
the
statute
is
so
clear
that,
deference
or
none,
there
really
is
no
other
way
to
read
the
language
of
the
statute.
as
i
say,
this
court,
in
united
states
versus
o'hagan,
concluded
squarely
that
this
language
does
not
mean
the
purchase
or
sale
of
the
plaintiff's
securities.
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion,
joined
in
by
justice
stevens,
in
the
holmes
case
makes
that
same
point.
significantly,
your
honors,
the
"in
connection
with"
language,
as
a
statutory
matter,
has
consistently
been
construed
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
and
by
this
court,
as
one
of
incredible
breadth.
most
recently,
in
united
states
versus
zandford,
this
court
concluded
that
the
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale.
"
language
means
anything
that
coincides
with
a
securities
transaction.
and
what
is
significant
in
this
case...
it
is
conceded
by
the
respondent
at
page
8
of
his
brief...
that
the
conduct
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
below
is
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
there
really
can
be
no
other
conclusion.
at
myriad
paragraphs
in
the
pleadings,
appearing,
among
others,
at
joint
appendix
53,
paragraph
4;
joint
appendix
53(a),
paragraph
5;
joint
appendix
59
to
60--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
answered
your
honor's
question
in
the
blue
chip
stamp
case,
where
it
specifically
rejected
that
sort
of
an
approach,
and
one
that
was
consistent
with
the
court
below.
what
the
court,
in
blue
chip
stamp...
which,
of
course,
was
a
civil
case
involving
an
alleged
holder's
claim
was
a
class
action...
what
this
court
said,
for
purposes
of
a
civil
proceeding,
is,
"purchase
or
seller
requirement
nowhere
appears
in
the
statutory
language.
"
the
statute
clearly
says
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
"
but,
as
a
statutory
matter,
this
court
concluded,
your
honor,
that
a
violation
of
10(b)(5)
had
been
alleged,
notwithstanding
going
on
to
conclude
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
recover,
as
a
matter
of
the
private
cause
of
action.
so,
we
understand...
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
it...
and
it
is
undisputed
on
this
record...
that
all
parties
agree,
as
the
court
below
concluded,
that
this...
congress
intended
to
impart
10(b)(5)
interpretation
as
a
statutory
matter
into
slusa.
we
also
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that,
were
your
honors
to
conclude
that
somehow
"in
connection
with"
means
something
different
in
a
civil
context,
a
narrower
reading
than
in
the
broader
context,
that
would,
of
course,
violate,
in
our
view,
the
rule
of
lenity
that
is
applied
by
this
court.
it
would
also
mark
what
we
believe
to
be
the
first
time,
insofar
as
we
have
been
able
to
determine...
and
respondent
cites
no
authority
to
the
contrary...
in
which
the
same
provisions
in
a
statute
that
have
civil
and
criminal--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--your
honor,
we...
and
we
have
cited
authority,
including
the
leocal
decision
of
this
court,
last
year,
in
which,
for
statutory
construction
purposes,
where
you
have
a
civil
and
a
criminal
statute
that
has
both
elements
to
it,
the
rule
of
lenity
would
dictate
that
the
narrower
reading
be
the
one
that
is
written.
so,
in
other
words,
if
this
court
were
to
have
concluded,
in
blue
chip...
excuse
me...
in
united
states
versus
o'hagan,
that,
as
a
criminal
matter,
the
"in
connection
with"
language
is
not
tethered
to
the
purchase
or
sale
by
a
particular
party
in
the
case,
that
is
a
broader
reading
than
the
reading
that
the
court
below
adopted
in
a
civil
case.
and
so,
what
we're
urging
is
that
the
rule
of
lenity
would
suggest
that,
if
this
court,
in
u.s.
v.
o'hagan,
took
the
view
that
the
"purchase
or
sale"
requirement
does
not
apply
in
a
criminal
context,
that
should
also
apply
in
a
civil
context,
that
a
narrower
reading
should
not
be
imparted
into
a
civil
context
than
you
would
find
in
a
criminal
context.
we
also--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
other
purpose
to
be
served
by
this
statute
than
to
preempt.
to
the
extent
that
embedded
in
your
honor's
question
is
a
question
with
respect
to
the
so
called
presumption
against
preemption,
we
don't
think
that
those
concerns,
or
the
concerns
to
which
your
honor
just
referred,
apply
in
this
case,
because
the
statute
is
clear;
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
the
language
that
congress
used,
and
hence...
and
it
would
have
made
no
sense,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
congress
to
have--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
agree
with
you
that,
in
terms
of
deciding,
for...
as
a
substantive
matter,
for
purposes
of
10(b)(5),
sec
versus
zandford,
how
far
the
outer
reaches
of
the
"in
connection
with"
language
go
may
well
be
susceptible
of
differences
of
opinion.
there
is
no
difference
of
opinion
to
which
there
can
be
any
disagreement,
in
this
case,
about
the
plain
language
of
the
preemption,
because
the
conduct...
no
matter
what
the
conduct
is
that
is
involved
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
"
one
thing
that
is
totally
crystal
clear,
based
on
this
court's
cases
and
congressional
purpose,
is
that
the
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale.
"
language,
as
used
here,
does
not
restrict
its
application
to
the
purchase
or
sale
by
the
plaintiff
such
that--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--justice
stevens,
one
misimpression
i
believe
that
the
court
below
was
under,
and
i
believe
is
perpetuated
by
respondent
in
his
amici,
this
statute
does
not
preempt
a
state
law
claim.
this
is
not
like
the
cases,
for
example--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--it
preempts
class
actions.
and
it's
significant,
because
congress
made
a
policy
judgment.
originally,
as
originally
introduced
in
the
house,
slusa
would
have
preempted
all
state
law
securities
cases.
all
of
them.
as
the
statute
wound
its
way
through
the
house
and
the
senate,
it...
and
principally
in
response
to
testimony
by
the
sec
commissioner
levitt,
who
went
to
the
hill
three
separate
times
on
this
legislation...
specific
statutory
exemptions
were
put
in.
but
it...
getting
back,
though,
to
the
purpose
behind--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--justice
stevens,
the--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--well,
we
believe
that
the--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--this
inquiry--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--begins
and
ends--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--yes.
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
your...
justice
stevens,
the
only
reference
to
the
purchaser
or
seller
issue
is
one
that
is
referenced
by
the
respondent.
and,
in
that
instance,
a
professor
from
cornell,
professor
painter,
went
to
the
hill,
and
he
said,
"if
you
enact
this
statute,
you
are
going
to
be
closing
off
claims
of
people
who
are
not
purchasers
or
sellers,
because
those
cannot
be
bought
in
the
federal
court.
"
but
back
for
a
moment,
though,
to
the
issue
of
what
is
not
preempted
in
the
policy
behind
this
statute,
there
was
another
component
that
congress
was
seeking
to
remedy
here,
and
that
was
the
so
called
"safe
harbor".
in
1995,
when
congress
enacted
the
private
securities
litigation
reform
act,
one
piece
of
that
was
an
effort
to
encourage
public
companies
to
make
predictive
statements
publicly.
there
had
been
a
rash
of
litigation,
at
the
time,
against
public
companies
whose
predictive
statements
proved
false.
and
so,
congress
said,
"wait
a
minute.
"
"we
will
allow
you
an
insulation
from
liability,
if
your
forward
statements
prove
false,
if
the
plaintiff
cannot
allege
either
that
they
were
made
with
actual
knowledge
or
not
accompanied
by
meaningful
cautionary
language.
"
another
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--yes.
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
yes.
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
justice
souter,
the
definition...
yes.
the
answer
to--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--your
question
is,
yes.
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
the
definition--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--individual
actions,
less
than
50
people,
arbitrations,
public
enforcement.
and,
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
counsel
referred
to
the
findings
in
the
legislation.
and
i
know
this
court
will
go
back
and
review
those.
the...
finding
number
5
does
not
use
the
word
"certain"
anywhere
in
it.
what
finding
number
5
does
say,
however,
"it
is
appropriate
to
enact
national
standards
for
securities
class
action
lawsuits
involving
nationally
traded
securities
while
preserving
the
appropriate
enforcement
powers
of
state
securities
regulators
and
not
changing
the
current
treatment
of
individual
lawsuits.
"
quote/unquote.
justice
breyer
and
justice
ginsburg
asked
questions
that
i
think
illustrate
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
such
an
anomalous
result
by
allowing
holders'
claims
to
proceed
as
nonpreempted.
justice
breyer,
as
a
practical
matter,
you
are
100
percent
right
in
the
premise
of
your
question.
if
this
court
agrees
with...
that
the
court
below
is
correct,
every
single
securities
class
action
that
is
brought
in
federal
court
from
that
day
forward
will
have
a
companion
claim
brought
with
it,
asserted
by
holders.
and
it's
not
simply
holders
in
the
fashion
that
mr.
dabit
appears,
which
is
somebody
who
claims,
"i
would
have
sold,
had
i,
essentially,
known
inside
information.
"
a
proposition
which
judge
friendly
expounded
on
in
the
levine
case
in
the
second
circuit,
but
you
will
also
have
holders...
you
will
also
have
claims
by
people
who
come
to
court,
in
the
state
court,
and
say,
"you
know,
i
would
have
bought
securities
if
you
had
not
issued
such
unduly
pessimistic
projections.
"
just
as
was
the
case
in
the
blue
chip
stamp
case.
and
imagine
the
impact
that
that
result
would
have
on
the
safe
harbor,
which
congress
enacted
with
the
pslra
to
protect
public
companies
in
the
united
states
and
abroad,
encouraging
them
to
make
forward
looking
statements.
if
you
allow
a
result
which
affords
putative
people,
who
would
have
bought
and
would
have
sold,
in
state
court
where
the
safe
harbor
doesn't
apply,
you
will
absolutely
be
gutting
the
statutory
protections
that
congress
was
seeking
to
protect.
i'd
like
to
just
make
one
point
about
the
weinberger
verse...
the
weinberger
v.
kendrick
case
that
is
mentioned.
that
involved
an
approval
of
a
federal
court
class
action
where
state
law
holders'
claims
were
being
released.
in
fact,
the
consideration
that
was
approved
there
was
less,
because
the
claims
were
weaker.
we've
heard
a
lot,
your
honors,
about
why
congress
didn't
mention
holders'
claims
by
name.
the
reason
they
didn't
mention
holders'
claims
by
name
is
that
it
wasn't
until
slusa
was
enacted
and
creative
plaintiff
strike
suit
lawyers
brought
holders'
claims,
in
an
effort
to
avoid
slusa,
that
this
problem
became
exacerbated.
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
plain
and
natural
meaning
of
slusa
picks
up
all
claims
by
any
private
party
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
security.
if
there
are
no--
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
b.
kasner
thank
you.
