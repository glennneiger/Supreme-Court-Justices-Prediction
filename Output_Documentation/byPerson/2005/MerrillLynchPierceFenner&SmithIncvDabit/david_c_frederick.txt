mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
our
position
is
that
slusa
does
not
preempt
class
actions
serving
holder
claims.
congress
incorporated
this
court's
interpretation
of
slusa.
slusa
rechanneled
state
suits
to
federal
court.
it
was
not
designed
to
eliminate
state
remedies
that
could
not
be
pursued
as
federal
10(b)(5)
claims.
that
interpretation
is
the
better
reading
of
the
text,
the
context,
and
the
history
of
slusa's
handling
of
private
securities
actions.
if
i
could
start
with
the
text--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
because
this
court,
in
the
blue
chip
stamps
case,
said
that
it
did
not.
in
footnote
5,
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
enforcement--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--actions,
the
sec
can
bring
enforcement
authority,
pursuant
to
10(b)(5).
and
so,
to
that
extent,
misconduct
that
would
be
connected
to
what,
in
a
private
context,
would
be
deemed
a
holder
claim,
does
fall
within
the
sec's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--jurisdiction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
do,
for
enforcement
purposes;
they
do
not,
for
private
civil
action
purposes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
understand
what
congress
intended.
and
what
congress
intended,
in
slusa,
i
think
is
quite
clear
if
you
start
at
the
beginning
of
the
statute
and
you
just
start
reading
your
way
through
it,
because
what
congress
did
in
slusa
was
attempt
to
stop
a
flight
of
cases
that
had
been
brought
in
federal
court
heretofore,
but
were
migrating
to
state
court,
congress
perceived,
as
a
result
of
the
enactment
of
the
pslra.
section
2
of
slusa...
and
it
is
very
important,
your
honors,
that
you
look
carefully
at
section
2
of
slusa,
because
it
has
five
congressional
findings.
they
are
not
adequately
briefed,
or
even
discussed,
by
the
second
circuit,
but
one
of
them
says
that
the
pslra
sought
to
prevent
abuses.
the
second
one
says,
since
an
enactment
of
that,
congress
perceives
that
a
number
of
securities
class
action
lawsuits
have
shifted
from
federal
to
state
courts.
the
third
one
says,
that
shift
has
prevented
the
act
from
achieving
its
objectives.
the
next
one
says,
state
securities
regulation
is
of
continuing
importance.
the
then,
the
fifth
one
says,
in
order
to
prevent
certain
state
private
securities
class
actions
alleging
fraud
from
being
used
to
frustrate
the
objectives
of
the
pslra,
it
is
appropriate
to
enact
these
national
standards.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
point,
though,
justice
scalia,
is
that
what
congress,
in
the
pslra,
was
doing
was
attempting
to
ratchet
up
the
pleading
requirements
for
federal
law
claims.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
absolutely--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
not
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
it's
important
to
emphasize
this.
what
the
court
addressed
in
the
blue
chip
stamps
case
was
a
very
different
kind
of
case.
it
involved
nonpurchasers.
and
the
court
reasoned
that
it
would
be
speculative
for
somebody
out
there
to
say,
"well,
i
would
have
purchased
the
security,
had
i
known.
"
a
holder
claim,
as
recognized
for
a
century
in
various
state
courts,
involves
a
claim
by
somebody
who
holds
a
security
and
is
induced
by
fraud
not
to
sell
that
security.
the
restatement
set
of
torts,
section
525,
recognizes
that
the
fraud
by
forebearance
of...
to
cause
you
not
to
take
an
action
is
just
as
much
a
fraud
as
one
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
most
circumstance,
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
that,
i
don't
think
is
material.
the
level
of
damages
that
a
holder
sustains
should
not
determine
what
the
elements
of
the
liability
are.
and
what
is
striking
about
the
government
and
merrill
lynch's
position
here
is
that
intentional
fraud
is
going
to
be
given
a
pass
because
of
those
persons
who
are
uniquely
harmed,
because,
for
20
years--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
the
same
kind
of
claim
that
in...
to
get
back
to
justice
scalia's
question...
arises
in
the
purchaser/seller
context.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
measure
of
damages
is
computed
by
when
you
purchase
or
sell,
as
opposed
to
when
you
bought
it,
before
the
fraud
occurred.
i
mean,
wall
street
has
been
telling
investors,
for
two
or
more
decades,
"buy
and
hold.
"
"rest
your
retirement,
hold
your
securities.
"
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
blue
chip--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--stamps
said
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
state
courts,
in
the
weinberger
case
that
we
cite,
they...
they
very
carefully
say
this
was
not
a
state
court
class
action,
but
what
judge
friendly,
in
the
weinberger
case,
addressed
was
a
state
law
holder--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--class
action--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--there
will
be,
in
most
circumstances.
there
are
some
circumstances
where
harms
are
unique
to
holders.
but,
justice
breyer,
can
i
point
out
to
you
that,
in
the
antitrust
context,
there
is,
under
illinois
brick,
a
requirement
that
you
must
be
in
the
direct
chain,
in
a
direct
purchaser,
but
there
are
some
30
states
that
have
allowed
standing
for
people--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
are
indirect
purchasers.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
let
me
address
that
this
way.
what
court...
what...
congress
was
very
clear
in
the
legislative
debates,
was...
it
did
not
want
to
cut
off
meritorious
claims.
it
simply
wanted
to
rechannel
them.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
many
states
doesn't
recognize
holder
claims
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
they
have
the
same
kinds
of
heightened
pleading
requirements
that
were
imposed
under
the
pslra.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
your
concern
should
be,
what
did
congress
intend?
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
eliminate
a
swath
of
class
actions
concerning
a
type
of
claim
that
this
court
had
said
could
not
be
brought
under--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--federal
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
that
that
was...
if
you
read
that
in
context,
i
don't
think
that
it
was
a
statement
by
the
speaker,
in
that
instance,
of
congress's
intent
to
go
beyond
those
claims
that
were
cognizable
under
federal
law,
and
to
cut
off
a
whole
category
of
claims
that
were
unique
to
state
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
we
think
the
weinberger
case
recognized
that
class
actions
could
be
brought,
under
new
york
law.
it
was
a
federal
case--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--but
it
was--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--true.
but,
in
the
'90s,
you
had
a
unique
form
of
fraud
that
was
being
perpetrated
on
wall
street
that
did
affect
holders
in
a
unique
way.
and
we've
highlighted
market
timing
in
our
briefs.
in
that
circumstance,
it
would
be
futile
for
49
holders
to
get
together
and
assert
that
they
had
been
harmed
by
market
timing,
because
the
aggregate
of
their
harm
is
so
small
that
you
really
have
to
look
at
it
in
a
large
context.
john
vogel,
the
head
of
vanguard
for
many
years,
and
one
of
most
respected
mutual
fund
advisors,
says
that
there
are
as
many
as
$5
billion
lost
by
people
who
buy
and
hold,
as
we've
been
taught
to
do
by
wall
street,
but
whose
aggregate
losses
accrete
every
year
by
virtue
of
market
timing.
that
is
a
unique
harm
caused
to
holders,
which,
under
their
theory,
would
not
be
cognizable,
because
it
would
be
preempted,
and
it
would
be
impossible,
as
a
practical
matter,
for
someone
to
get
together
with
48
of
his
or
her
fellow
victims
and
try
to
bring
a
claim
to
redress
that.
there's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no
evidence--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
don't
have
a
history
of
timer
claims,
but
what
we
also
don't
have,
justice
stevens,
is
an
indication
by
congress,
throughout
the
entire
legislative
debate
or
the
conference
reports
or
anything,
where
holder
claims
which
had
been
brought
were
perceived
to
be
a
problem
and
were
perceived
to
be
within
the
ambit
of
what
congress
was
doing.
because,
remember--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
could--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
could
not
be
brought
under
federal
law,
before.
and
i
would
acknowledge
that,
because
of
a
series
of
this
court's
decisions,
it
is
easier
to
prove
a
purchaser/seller
claim,
where
the
facts
warrant
that,
under
10(b)
prior
to
the
pslra
than
it
was
to
prove
a
holder
claim.
judge
friendly,
in
the
weinberger
opinion,
makes
very
clear
that
the
value
to
be
attributed
to
the
class
action
settlement
there
has
to
be
diminished
because
of
the
difficulty
of
proof
of
such
claims.
but
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i'd
like
to
address
the
point
that
the
government
makes
about
how
this
would
supposedly
affect
the
sec's
enforcement
authority--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
that
it's
correct
to
characterize
it
as
more
plaintiff
friendly.
if
you're
in
minnesota,
you
can't
bring
one
of
these
claims,
because
state
law
doesn't
recognize
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
some
states,
you...
where
the
common
law
or
the
state
statutes
recognize
these
claims,
all
that
we're
arguing
is
that
congress
didn't
focus
on
these.
in
the
normal
presumption
against
preemption,
you
don't,
you
know,
cut
through
a
wide
swath
of
claims
where
congress
hasn't
expressed
an
intent
specifically
to
preempt
them.
that's
our
position,
and
particularly
where
the
congressional
findings--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
certainly,
just
as
"breach
of
fiduciary
duty"
and
"breach
of
the
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing.
"
are
state
law
claims,
negligence
is
a
state
law
claim,
all
of
those
give
rise
to
variations,
state
by
state.
but
what
congress
was
getting
at
were
fraud
claims
that
were
federal
law
fraud
claims.
and,
when
it
did
so,
it
was
heightening
the
pleading
requirements
and,
seeing
what
people
were
doing
was
taking
what
were
federal
law
claims
and
migrating
them
to
state
court
under,
ostensibly,
more
lenient
standards--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--he
can't
do
that
under
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--under
the
second
circuit's
test,
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
logic
is
that,
for
the
buyers
of
those
claims,
they
are
meeting
the
federal
standard
of
"in
connection
with"--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--"#
purchase
or
sale".
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
they
are,
because
they're
buying...
the
reason
why
these
people
have...
under
the
second
circuit's
standard,
which
we
think
is
correct,
is
that
you
have
to
have
bought
the
stock
before
the
fraud,
and
you
were
holding
it
throughout
that
period
of
fraud;
and
so,
your
purchase
is
not
"in
connection
with"
the
fraud,
the
misrepresentation.
but
somebody
who
sees
the
prospectus,
who
sees
what
mr.
blodget
was
saying,
which
was
that
there
were
stocks
that
were,
quote,
"a
piece
of
crap",
but
they
were
giving
them
the
highest
buy
recommendation...
those
people
are
making
their
purchase
"in
connection
with"--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--"#
a
fraud".
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think,
also,
one
of
the
second
circuit's
standard,
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i
think
that
the
reason
why
not
is
that
if
the
fraud
is
affecting
the
plaintiff's
decision
to
purchase,
then
that
falls
within
slusa,
and
that
is
preempted,
although
it
allow...
you
are
allowed
to
have
a
federal
remedy
under
that
standard.
you're
rechanneled
to
federal
court.
but
if
you
buy...
to
use
your
hypothetical,
you
buy
in
january,
but
the
fraudulent
misrepresentations
are
not
made
until
may
or
june,
you're
precluded
from
bringing
a
federal
law
claim.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
our
position.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
our
position--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--is
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--is
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
i--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
hypothetical.
i
thought
your
hypothetical
was
that
if
you
bought,
prior
to
the
fraud--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
you
bought--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
connection
with--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--a
fraud--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--then
you
are...
you
are...
you
are
forced
into
federal
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--under
slusa.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
was--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
was
the
decision
that
congress
made.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
this
preemption
provision--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
your--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--your--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
the
second
circuit
said,
which
i
think
is
correct,
is
that...
is
that
your
damages
have
to
be
totally
and
apart
from
the
fraud
as
a
purchaser,
and
that
where--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
reason
why
they
set
this
timeframe
for
holder
claims
is
that
those
kinds
of
claims
that
you're
talking
about,
justice
scalia,
would
be
a
classic
purchaser/seller
type
claim,
and
you
can
bring
that
in
federal
court.
and
that's
the
point
here,
that,
where
you've
got
long
term
holders,
and
you've
got
people
who
purchased
in
the
'80s
or
the
'70s,
and
they're
being
induced
to
hold
for
decades,
and
they
may
want
to
make...
they
may
suffer
their
damages
as
a
result
of
collateral
that
they
want
to
borrow
against...
they
have
no
practical
means
of
recovery--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
the
second
circuit
said,
which
i
think
is
correct,
is
that
that
becomes
a
level
of
line
drawing
that
we
don't
think
congress
did
intend
to
get
into.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
hoops
that
congress
went
to,
and
which
i
have
articulated,
in
the
congressional
findings,
are
that
the
particular
harm
that
congress
was
addressing
in
slusa...
this
was
a
narrow...
you
know,
this
was
a
narrowly
framed
preemption
as
to
federal
law
claims,
because
a...
the
pslra
only
governed
federal
law
claims.
and
if
you
could
not
bring
a
holder
claim
under
federal
law,
because
of
blue
chip
stamps,
you
were
forced
into
state
court.
okay?
so,
when
congress
is
debating
the
evasion
of
the
pslra,
it
is
only
talking
about
federal
law
claims.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
they
cited,
or
that
we
have
found,
to
suggest
that
congress
gave
any
thought
to
preempting
a
class
of
holder
claims.
now,
certainly--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i'm
not
aware
of
legislation,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
what...
what
this
court
did
say,
in
blue
chip
stamps,
was
that,
when
the
birnbaum
decision...
and
it
was
an
interpretation
of
"in
connection
with
purchase
or
sale.
"
by
what
one
justice
on
this
court
described
as
the
"mother
court
of
the
court
appeals.
"
--it
was
chief
judge
swan,
judge
augustus
hand,
and
judge
learned
hand...
and
they
construed
the
words
to
mean
the
plaintiff's
purchase--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--or
sale.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
think
it...
it
did
adopt
the
rule,
though,
as
a
basis
of
the
wording.
and
if
you
look
at
page
733
of
the
court's
opinion,
it
was
adopting
the
rationale,
in
the
sense
that
it
saw
birnbaum
as
a
construction
of
the
language,
and
it
adopted
that.
and
then
in
note
5,
when
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
says,
"it
would
be
odd
to
read
in
connection
with
purchase
or
sell
to
give
a.
"
quote,
"cause
of
action
to
everybody
in
the
world.
"
i
think
it's
clear
that
that
was
suggesting
that
state
law
could
recognize
something
that
this
court
said
was
not
recognized
under
federal
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
this
statute
is
a...
about
private
civil
actions,
and
it
doesn't
affect
the
sec's
enforcement
authority
or
any
action.
in
fact,
the
sec
doesn't
derive
any
greater
power,
or
lesser
power,
as
a
result
of
the
enactment
of
slusa.
it
is
entirely
legislated
against
private
civil
actions.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
so,
the
sec--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--this
is
an
act,
justice
scalia,
where
the
sec's
enforcement
authority
isn't
affected
one
jot.
and
so,
i
think
it
would
be
a
strange
application
of
chevron,
or
even
skidmore,
deference
to
say
that
the
sec
gets
some
special
weight
because
it's
construing
words
in
an
enactment--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
addressed
to
private--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--civil
litigation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
and
it
took
the
position
there
that
"in
connection
with"
did
have
a
broad
construction.
and
that
position
was
rejected.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
the
court,
there,
i
don't
think
was...
it
said
that
it
was
not
in...
giving
any
deference
to
the
sec's
position,
because
it
was
an
implied
private
right
of
action
that
this
court
had
recognized,
and
that
the
lower
courts
had
recognized.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
there
are
class
actions
that
concern
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty,
negligence.
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
are
"in
connection
with
purchase
or
sale.
"
is
going
to
have
a
profound
impact
on
whether
or
not
those
claims
are
also
preempted.
i
can't
spell
out
for
you
what
the
necessary
consequences
are,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
state
law
claims
brought
under
blue
sky
laws
and
other
state
remedies
that
traditionally
have
been
observed
and
brought,
even
as
state
claims,
but,
under
a...
you
know,
the
all
encompassing
parameter
of
advanced
on
the
other
side,
a
decision
that
would
favor
that
could
have
unknown
preemptive
consequences,
which
i
would
submit
would
be
contrary
to
the
normal
way
you
would
put
congress
to
the
test
of
determining,
"did
it
intend
to
preempt
those
claims?
"
before
adopting
a
broad
interpretation
that
would
do
so.
and
if
i
could
point
out--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--one
of
the
strange
things
about
this
case
and
the
sec's
position
is
that
district
courts
are
going
to
be
put
in
the
rather
unusual
position
of
paying
a
rather
high
cost,
because
if
they
are
confronted
with
a
removal
of
a
case
brought
under
state
law,
where
the
defendant
asserts
that
it
is
preempted
under
slusa,
and
the
sec
hasn't
taken
any
action
at
all,
and
has
expressed
no
interest
in
this
particular
area,
the
district
court,
to
determine
preemption,
has
to
intuit
whether
or
not
this
is
within
the
sec's
enforcement
authority.
so,
you
have...
ordinarily,
you
would
have
private
plaintiffs
suing
for
wrongdoing
on
the
same
side
of
the
case
as
the
sec,
as
the
public
enforcer.
but,
here,
you
have
them
at
loggerheads.
and
the
only
way
that
the
district
court
can
properly
figure
that
out,
whether
or
not
the
private
victim
can
get
a
private
remedy,
is
to
cut
back
on
the
sec's
enforcement
authority,
will...
if
you
will...
would
exact
an
awfully
high
cost.
i
would
submit
that
that
kind
of
an
anomaly
is
a
rather
unusual
one,
particularly
where
the
sec
isn't
a
party
in
the
case,
and
it
is
not
being
invited
to
submit
a
brief.
and
yet,
district
courts,
in
order
to
determine
the
preemption
question
here,
are
going
to
have
to
rule
against
the
sec
in
order
to
give
a
private
remedy...
to
recognize
a
private
remedy
under
state
law,
or
to
cut
back
on
a
remedy
under
state
law
by
holding
that
it
is
within
the
sec's
enforcement
jurisdiction.
ultimately,
what
merrill
lynch
here
is
asserting
is
an
immunity
for
a
fraud
that
uniquely
affects
a
certain
class
of
holders
who
do
not
have
a
remedy
under
federal
law.
and
i
would
submit
that,
where
any
party
is
seeking
to
get
an
immunity
from
an
intentional
fraud,
the
party
bears
a
heavy
presumption
that
that
is,
in
fact,
what
congress
intended.
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that,
both
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
findings
that
congress
made
in
the
legislative
history,
congress
did
not
express
an
intent
to
eliminate
holder
class
actions
of
greater
than
49
persons.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
it's
preemption
to
rechannel.
and
that's
the
important
point,
justice
scalia.
the
point
was
not
to
allow
state
law
claims
under
state
court
systems,
but
to
rechannel
those
actions
into
federal
court.
and
if
there
are
a
category
of
victims
of
frauds
who
have
no
federal
remedy,
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
infer
that
congress,
without
saying
so,
left
those
people
without
any
remedy
whatsoever.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
it
depends
on
how
the
courts
would
construe
the
slusa
cases
as
affecting
the
"in
connection
with
purchase
or
sale.
"
in
the
sec
enforcement
authority.
if
you
were
to
accept
the
premise
that
the
court's
zandford
and
o'hagan
decisions
are
binding
on
the
slusa
preemption
language,
anytime
a
court
is
construing--
may
i
finish,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
anytime
a
court
is
construing
that
language,
in
the
slusa
context,
it
would
necessarily
have
a
collateral
impact
on
the
sec's
enforcement
authority
in
10(b).
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
could
certainly
relitigate
it.
but
the
point
of
the
persuasive
authority
of
a
construction
of
"in
connection
with
purchase
or
sale.
"
i
think,
would
have
effects
that
are
inappropriate.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you.
