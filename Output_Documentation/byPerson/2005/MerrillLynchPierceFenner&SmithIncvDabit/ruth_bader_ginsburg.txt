mr.
kasner,
may
i
just
interrupt
those
references
to
ask
you...
one
could
agree
that,
for
sec
enforcement
purposes,
for
prosecutorial
purposes,
the
"in
connection
with"
is
as
broad
as
you
suggest.
but
for
purposes
of
private
actions,
it
isn't
that
broad;
it
is
limited,
as
this
court
said
in
blue
chip
stamps.
it
is
possible
for
the
same
words,
even
in
the
same
statute,
in
difference
contexts,
to
mean
different
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
explain
that
rule
of
lenity?
because,
on
criminal,
it
is
as
broad
as
can
be.
i
didn't
know
that
there
was
a
rule
of
lenity
that
applied
strictly
to
civil
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
claim
that's
made
here,
the
second
claim,
where
the
broker
said,
"we
lost
clients,
so...
as
a
result
of
this
deception...
and
we
want
to
be
compensated
for
that.
"
not
being
about
the
inflated
price
of
the
security--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--just
that
"our
clients
don't
trust
us
anymore,
because
we
gave
them
such
bad
advice.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know,
but
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wanted
to
know
what
the
government's
position
was
on
that
claim.
could
that
be
brought
in
a
state
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
as
a
class
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
deal
with
the
court's...
the
footnote
in
the
blue
chip
stamps...
that
the
court
says...
in
the
federal
court...
"these
10(b)
actions
have
to
be
limited
to
actual
purchasers
and
sellers.
"
but
that
limitation
is
attenuated,
because
deserving
claims
by
nontraders
would
lie
under
state
law,
including
the
very
suit
that
was
involved
in
blue
chip
stamps
and
in
the
second
circuit
case
that
paved
the
way
for
blue
chip?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
get
to
that,
just...
mr.
frederick,
the
logic
of
it...
but...
here,
congress
is
tightening
the
requirements
for
class
actions,
but
then
there
is
this
class,
which...
blue
chip
did
say
there's
a
lot...
room
for
a
lot
of
abuse
in
holder
classes...
would
be
left
to
the
state
courts
for
whatever
strict
or
lenient
rules.
so,
why
would
congress,
with
respect
to
this
category,
want
there
to
be
a
more
plaintiff
friendly
rule
than
the
rule
that
congress
has
just
put
in
place
for
the
purchaser/seller
10(b)
actions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
at
least
in
some
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
you're
admitting
that
an...
that
anomaly
could
be
part
of
the
scene,
that
you'd
have
a
state
that
allows
you
to
sue
for
negligence,
and
doesn't
have
heightened
pleading
requirements
for
holder
claims;
and
so,
those
claims
would
be
treated
more...
in
a
more
plaintiff
friendly
way
than
federal
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
finish...
there's
two
questions
i
would
like
to
ask
him.
one
is...
we
know
about
the
holder
claims.
they
are
saved
for
state
actions.
they're
not
preempted.
what
else
would
fall
in
this
category
that
is
not...
that
slusa
doesn't
affect,
that
can
be
brought
as
class
actions
in
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you--
