in
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in...
suppose
a
person
bought
the
stock
at
price
30
before
any
fraud
took
place,
and
then
he
holds
it,
and
then
the
fraud,
and
then,
subsequently,
the
word
of
the
fraud
gets
out,
the
price
falls
a
lot,
and
he
sells
it.
does
he
have
a
claim,
under
federal...
ordinary...
you
know,
does
he...
can
he
go
into
federal
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then...
i
see
that...
then
what's
worrying
me
is
this,
that...
one
thing
worrying
me
is
that...
let's
take
an
ordinary
buyer
case.
all
right?
and
what
happened
is
that
the...
some
buyers
would
like
to
bring
a
fraud
suit
in
federal
court.
they
have
to
go
to
federal
court
now.
they
can't
go
to
the
state
court.
but
they
have
a
little
brainstorm,
or
the
lawyers
do,
and
they
say,
"well,
in
any
case
where
a
buyer
would
have
a
claim,
and
we
don't
want
to
go
into
federal
court,
there
surely
are
going
to
be
a
class
of
holders
that
would
also
have
the
kind
of
claim
you
say.
"
so,
there
we
are,
same
actions,
all
in
the
state
court,
just
happens
to
have
found
a
different
class
of
claimant.
and
there
always
will
be
such
a
class.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
fine.
and
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
what
i'm
not
facing,
in
the
antitrust
area,
is
what,
it
seems
to
me,
on
your
interpretation
now,
would
be,
congress
passes
a
law,
which
becomes
a
futile
act,
because
what
they're
anxious
is...
to
do
is
to
get
the
cases
in
the
class
actions...
not
all
the
cases...
but
the
class
actions
in
the
federal
court.
and
then,
in
every
single
case,
or
99.9999
percent,
where
we've
kept
this
action
out
of
federal
court,
there's
going
to
be
a
comparable
action,
with
holders
as
the
plaintiff,
in
a
state
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what...
that's
a...
my
concern.
what
do
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
you...
can
you
ease
my
concern
there?
is
there
anything
you
can
say
that
could
ease
my
concern
that
we'll
have
the
same
set,
that
they'll
just
be
in
state
court
with
a
different
class?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
by
the
way,
my
concern
is
not
that
it's
a
"bad
thing",
in
quotes.
my
concern
is
that
it's
hard
for
me
to
think
congress
would
have
done
something
that
wouldn't
have
had
much
effect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
that's
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
why,
in
your
theory...
suppose
you're
right.
i
mean,
you're
right.
i
assume
that.
you
can
have
these
holder
claims.
but
why
couldn't
any
buyer,
who's...
has
to
go
to
federal
court
because
he
has
the
buyer
claim,
just
say,
"i'll
bring
a
holder
claim"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
but
what
i'm
asking
is,
what's
the
logic
of
that?
i
mean,
you're
either
right
or
you're
wrong.
if
congress
didn't
want
to
cut
off
the
holder
claim,
they
didn't.
so,
what's
to
show
that
they
wanted
to
cut
it
off
for
some
people,
but
not
other
people?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
in
this
suit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
this
suit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if
i'm
both--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
bought
it
in
may,
in
reliance
on
this
ridiculous
thing.
"buggy
whips
make
gold".
i
believed
it.
i
bought
buggy
whips.
now...
we're
now
in
december.
and
every
month,
they
kept
repeating
it.
and
my
claim
is,
"yes,
i
know,
i
bought
it
in
may,
in
reliance,
but
i
kept
it
in
july,
because
i
kept
seeing
it
repeated
and
repeated.
"
do
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
a
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
second
circuit,
i
do
not.
but
i
want
to
know
why
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you.
but
that's
the
trouble.
because,
in
order
to
make
the
second
circuit's
argument,
you
have
to
say
the
following,
"congress
couldn't
have
intended
to
allow
people
who
have
a
buyer
claim
to
make
a
totally
separate
holder
claim,
because
that
would
gut
the
statute,
and
they
wouldn't
want
to
engage
in
a
futile
act.
"
but
now
you're
asking
us
to
do
about
the
same
thing,
when
you
talk
about
a
person
who
doesn't
have
the
buyer
claim
and
you're
trying
to
get
us
to
say,
"congress
thought...
congress
thought
an
individual
action
there,
their
own
separate
action
in
the
state
court,
wasn't
good
enough;
it
would
have
wanted
to
preserve
the...
hold
your
claim
for
them.
"
now,
that's
possible,
but
it
requires
me
to
think
congress
is
going
through
quite
a
few
hoops
here.
