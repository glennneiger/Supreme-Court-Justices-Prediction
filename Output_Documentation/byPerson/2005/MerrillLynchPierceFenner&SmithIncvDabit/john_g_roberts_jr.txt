we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
04-1371,
merrill
lynch,
pierce,
fenner
&
smith
versus
dabit.
mr.
kasner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
one
reason
you
might
want
to
adopt
a
narrower
reading,
though,
is,
we're
dealing
here
with
the
preemption
provision.
it's
one
thing
to
say
that,
when
you're
talking
about
the
sec's
enforcement
powers,
you
adopt
a
broad
reading;
but
it's
quite
another
thing,
when
you're
talking
about
displacing
state
law,
that
you
would
necessarily
adopt
the
same
broad
reading.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there's
a
lot
of...
i
think
our
cases
establish
that
a
phrase
like
"in
connection
with"
carries
with
it
a
lot
of
ambiguity.
you
don't
know
exactly
how
rigorous
the
connection
has
to
be.
i
mean,
a
auto
accident
by
a
broker
who's
leaving
his
office...
he
wouldn't
be
in
the
office
if
he
weren't
buying
and
selling
securities.
i
mean,
is
that
auto
accident
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
and
sales
of
securities?
"
no.
and
yet,
you
know,
theoretically
it
could
be.
it's
a...
there's
a
lot
of
ambiguity
in
determining
how
much
breadth
to
give
that
phrase.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kasner.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--think
it
means
"any".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
it
means
"any",
right?
you're
reading
"the"
to
mean
"any".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the--
--but
the
fraud
is
caused...
the
fraud
causes
other
people
to
want
to
buy
the
security.
they
do
so
at
a
higher
price.
it
causes
the
price
to
go
up.
it's
"in
connection
with
a
purchase
or
sale.
"
maybe
not
of
the
holder's
securities.
but
it's
certainly...
the
holder's
claim
wouldn't
exist,
but
for
purchases
and
sales
that
caused
the
price
to
go
up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
your
clients
want
to
do
is
cash
in
on
the
fraud.
they
don't...
their
claim
is
that
they
didn't
get
to
sell
the
stock
at
an
inflated
price
to
somebody
who
didn't
know
about
the
fraud.
that's
the
damages
that
they
want
to
collect.
and
that
seems
to
be
an
odd
claim
to
recognize.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kasner,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
in
04-1371,
merrill
lynch,
pierce,
fenner
&
smith
versus
dabit.
