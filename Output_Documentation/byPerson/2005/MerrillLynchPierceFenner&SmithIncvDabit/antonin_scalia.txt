mr.
kasner,
the...
does
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
have
enforcement
authority
in
this...
in
this
area?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
they
issued
any
rules
or
regulations
on
this...
on
this
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
point
that
you're
arguing,
whether
the
critical
language
means
the
person's
own
sale,
or
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it
your
position
that
we
owe
deference
to
the
interpretation
of
the
sec?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it's
just
skidmore,
forget
about
it.
[laughter]
i
mean,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
always
thought
"the"
meant
"the".
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
"his
or
her"
means
"his
or
her".
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
doesn't
say
that
"all"
are
covered.
the
government
acknowledges
that
there
are
some
actions
that
could
still
be
brought
in
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
so...
it's
so
counterintuitive.
as
the
government
points
out,
these
holder
claims
lend
themselves
to
abuse
much
more
than
do
the
narrow
purchase
and
sale
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
the
government
would
want
to
police
the
one,
and
let
the
other,
you
know,
proliferate,
seems
very
strange
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
because
they...
i
mean,
the
argument
made
by
the
government
"of
course
not,
because
the
only
reason
they're
brought
is
precisely
to
evade
this
congressional
legislation.
"
they
didn't
exist,
before;
and
they've
become
common,
afterwards.
now...
you
know,
i...
you
can
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
that
there
were...
well,
never
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
choose
not
to
complain
about
my
buying,
i
just
choose
to
complain
about
my
holding?
it's
true,
i
was
harmed
because
i
jumped
in.
and
that's
one
harm.
but
it's
an
entirely
separate
harm
that
i
was
induced
to
hold
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
these
continuing
misrepresentations.
why
can't
that
part
of
the
suit
be
brought
in
state
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is?
okay.
so,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
agree--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
agree
that
a
buyer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who...
whose
purchase
is
excluded,
can
nonetheless
sue--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
a
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
no,
no,
no.
you
bought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
reliance--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
fraud--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
buying
claim,
and
i
have
a
holding
claim.
why
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
there
in
the
statute
that
says
the
two
have
to
go
with
each
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
where?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
making--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
buying
claim.
i...
and
there's
nothing
in
my
complaint
about
my
buying
the
stock.
i
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
"#
i
was
induced
to
hold
the
stock
by
these
representations
that
occurred
in
february,
march,
april,
and
may.
"
"i
bought,
in
january,
also
in
reliance
on
fraud,
but
i'm
not
complaining
about
that.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
are--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
a
practical
matter,
my
damages
from
the
holding
may
be
much
greater
than
my
damages
from
the
initial
purchase.
and
you're
saying,
"tough
luck,
charlie.
"
"you
bought
a
month
too
soon...
or
a
month
too
late.
"
"you
should
have
brought...
bought
before
the
fraud.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frederick,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
language
"in
connection
with",
you
know,
whether
it
means
what
blue
chip
meant
or
whether
it
means
what
the
statute
meant,
is
at
least
ambiguous.
and,
if
that's
the
case,
why
shouldn't
we
be
guided
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission's
determination,
under
chevron,
mead,
you
know,
anything
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
we
not
given
any
weight
to
sec
determinations,
as
to
its
interpretation,
where
civil
actions
are
involved?
i'm
surprised
at
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
that
presumption
against
preemption,
where
the
question
is,
does
this
federal
statute,
which
says
nothing
about
preemption,
accidentally
preempt
some
state
law
+/?
that
there,
the
presumption
makes
sense.
but
here,
you
have
a
statute,
the
whole
object
of
which
is
preemption.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
what
you
shouldn't
do
in
that
case
is
just
give
the
language
its
most
reasonable
reading,
with
no
thumb
on
either
side
of
the
scale.
