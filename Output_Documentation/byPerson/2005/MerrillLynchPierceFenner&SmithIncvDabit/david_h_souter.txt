justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt?
because
i'm--
justice
david
h.
souter
--your
time
is
running
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
my
understanding
correct
that,
on
your
reading,
state
class
actions
of
less
than
50
parties
are
also
left
unpreempted?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--individual
actions
and
small
state
class
actions.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
do
you
make
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
then--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
do
you
make
of
the
legislative
history?
i
mean,
your
friend
on
the
other
side
pointed
out
that
there
was
very
clear
testimony
to
the
effect
that
if
the
statute
passed,
with
the
text
that
we're
dealing
with,
that
it
would,
indeed,
cut
out
a
series
of
claims.
