mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
fundamental
flaw
in
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
is
that
it
requires
the
phrase
"in
connection
with"
to
be
given
two
different
and
irreconcilable
interpretations,
depending
on
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff.
nothing
in
the
text
or
history
of
the
securities
laws
justifies
that
implausible
interpretation.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
think
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
the
mr.
kasner
indicated,
that
issue
has
been
dispositively
resolved
by
this
court
and
the
commission
in
concluding
that
the
purchaser/seller
rule
is
not
a
limitation
on
the
scope
of
the
prohibition
in
section
10(b).
and
if
your
interpretation
were
the
one
that
were
adopted,
that
would
not
be
the
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
certainly,
that
would
be
our
submission.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
and,
again--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--if
it--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
right,
it's
"the"...
well,
it's
"the",
in
the
sense
of
"the
activity
of
purchasing
and
selling
securities.
"
yes.
it's...
and
that's
how
this
court
has
interpreted,
in
the
o'hagan
case,
for...
if
that
interpretation...
if
sec
could
bring
an
enforcement
action,
or
the
justice
department
could
bring
a
prosecution,
in
a
case
like
o'hagan,
where
the...
where
the
court
specifically
said
that
the
purchaser
or
seller
was
not
defrauded.
it's
not
that...
it's
not
true
that
section
10(b)
requires
that
the
purchaser
or
seller
be
defrauded.
and
so,
we
submit
that
this
would
be--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
we
certainly
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but,
more
generally,
it
doesn't
require
that
there
be
a
purchaser
or
seller
who's
defrauded,
and
yet
the
purchaser/seller
rule,
for
the
purpose
of
implied
actions,
does
require
that.
justice
stevens,
you
asked
about
whether
there
is
any
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
this
act
to
preempt
class
action
claims
where
there
would
be
no
federal
remedy.
the
answer
to
that
is,
absolutely
yes.
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
knew,
and
expected,
that
claims
that
could
be
brought
under
state
law
as
class
actions,
such
as
aiding
and
abetting
claims
or
negligent
misrepresentation
claims,
claims
that
would
not
satisfy
the
federal--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--scienter
requirements
for...
and,
of
course,
the
claims
that
would
not
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
pslra.
none
of
those
could
be
brought
in
federal
court,
because
they're
barred
by
the
various
provisions
of
federal
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
in
cases
where
the...
where
the
only
claim
is
against
aiders
and
abetters,
those
parties
would
be...
would
be
out
of
court;
or,
likewise,
cases
where
parties
could
not
satisfy
the
scienter
requirement,
those
parties
would
be
out
of
court.
so,
congress
knew
that
it
would
be
foreclosing
remedies
for
certain
categories
of
claims,
and
that
was
part
of
the
point
of
the
act,
as
the
conference
committee
report
makes
clear.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
congress
was--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
the...
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--because
it
was
not--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
commission
addressed
that
question
in
its
amicus
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
took
the
position
that
that
claim
was
not
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities,
because
the
injury
occurs
after
the
fraud
has
been
completed,
and
is...
and
has
to
do
with
the
lost
future
relationship,
rather
than
fraud
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
and
so,
we
didn't
address
that
in
our
brief
here,
obviously,
but
the
commission
took
the
position,
below,
that
that
would
not
be
preempted,
because
it's
not
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
that
was
an
accurate
description
of
the
state
of
the
law,
as
it
existed
at
the
time,
at
least
in
theory,
although,
as
a
practical
matter,
respondents
have
not
been
able
to
point
to
a
single
reported
case
a...
of
a
holder
class
action
in
state
court
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
uniform
standards
act.
so,
while
it
was
true,
as
a
theoretical
matter,
that
such
claims
could
be
brought
under
the
law
of
some
states,
there
are...
there
is
no
history
of
state
class
actions
in
this
area,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
reliance
on
the
assumption
of
nonpreemption
makes
no
sense
here.
securities
class
actions
prior
to
the
pslra
were
brought
in
federal
court,
and
it
was
only
the
pslra
that
resulted
in
cases,
such
as
the
type
of
case
at
issue
here,
being
brought
in
state
courts.
and
congress...
once
it
saw
that
problem,
congress
was
concerned
that
the
requirements
of
the
pslra
were
being
evaded,
and
it
was
also
concerned,
as
the
conference
committee
report
makes
clear,
that,
now
that
these
securities
class
actions
were
being
brought
in
state
court,
there
was
the
potential
danger
of
50
varying
state
standards
being
applied,
as
this
very
case
suggests,
and
congress
acted
to
remedy
both
of
those
problems,
as
the
conference
committee
report
makes
clear,
both
the
risk
of
nonuniformity
in
securities
class
actions
that
are
targeted
by
the
act,
and
the
risk
of
evasion
of
the
pslra.
respondent's
position
would
frustrate
both
of
those
objectives,
because
it
would...
it
would
permit
the
most
abusive
category
of
lawsuits
to
proceed
in
state
court,
and
it
would
permit
such
holder
claims
to
be
brought...
for
instance,
based
on
negligence,
if
state
law
permitted
that;
based
on
conduct
that
would
be
protected
by
the
federal
safe
harbor
for
forward
looking
statements
under
the
pslra.
so,
the
pslra
protections
would
be
frustrated
by
their
interpretation.
so,
the
very
goals
that
congress
explicitly
sought
to
achieve,
stated
in
the...
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
in
the
purposes
section
and
also
in
the
conference
committee
report,
would
be
frustrated.
and,
again,
that
approach
requires
the
court
to
accept
an
inconsistent
interpretation
of
the
text
of
the
"in
connection
with"
requirement,
depending
on
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff,
which
would
be
an
extraordinary
way
to
construe
a
statute,
particularly
when
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
provides
even
a
hint
of
a
suggestion
that
congress
would
have
intended
that
result.
and
with
respect
to
blue
chip,
your
honor,
it's
important
to
remember
what
blue
chip
was
doing.
blue
chip
was
not
a
case
about
the
scope
of
the
10(b)
prohibition.
instead,
it
was
a
case
about
what
to
infer
about
what
congress
would
have
wanted
to
authorize
as
an...
as
a
right
of
action,
if
it
had
addressed
the
question.
and
that's
why
the
blue
chip
court
made
very
clear
that
the
conduct
at
issue
there
involving
injuries
to
holders
can
be
a
violation
of
section
10(b)...
i.e.,
it
can
be
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities...
it's
just
that
they
did
not
think
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
authorize
a
private
right
of
action.
so,
again,
when
we're
talking
about
the
scope
of
the
"in
connection
with"
requirement,
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here,
that
approach
is
the
same
approach
that
should
be
followed
here,
the
same
approach
that
was
in...
followed
in
o'hagan
and
in
zandford,
and
compelled
to
the
conclusion
that,
since
the
conduct
at
issue
here
is
unquestionably
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities.
"
as
this
court
has
construed
that
phrase,
it
is
preempted
by
the
uniform
standards
act.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
