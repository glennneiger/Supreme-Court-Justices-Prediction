and
there
is...
in
fact,
there's
no
immunity.
that's
what
makes
this
different.
suppose
the
bivens
action
had
been
brought
first.
the
officers
would
not
have
been
immune
from
suit.
it's
not
like
an
officer
who
has
qualified
immunity
and
doesn't
depend
upon
the
suit
order.
here,
there
would
have
been
no
immunity
at
all
if
you'd
sued
the
officers
directly
and
not
brought
that
federal
tort
claims
act
suit
first.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
hard
to
accept
that
argument
given
that
if
the
lawyer
had
sued
in
the
reverse
order,
there
would
be
the
same
morale.
all
the
rest
would
follow.
so
here
it's...
it's
a
question
of
the
lawyer
brought
the
wrong
lawsuit
first,
and
the
attack
on
the
morale...
there's
no
difference
if
a
bivens
action
had
been
brought
and
no
other
action.
is
there
any...
why
is
this
morale
changed
by
the
government
having
gotten
the
first
case
dismissed
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
with
no
consideration
of
the
merits
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
harassment
that
this
employee
experienced
in
the...
in
the
ftca
claim
that
was
dismissed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
that...
did
that
involve
the
employee
or
it
was
just
legal
argument
involving
lawyers
representing
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
two
claims
have
been
brought
together?
this
is...
if
an
employee
is
in
an
uncertain
situation,
doesn't
know
if
the
ftca
act
applies,
it
certainly
doesn't
want
to
be
without
any
defendant
for
conduct
of
the
kind
that...
that
this
complaint
charges.
could
such
an
employee
say
i
want
to
bring
my
tort
claims
act
against
the
united
states,
but
i'd
like
to
have
in
that
same
lawsuit,
in
case
the
court
says
it
comes
under
an
exception,
my
bivens
claim?
would
it
be
possible
to
bring
those
suits
together?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm...
i'm
asking--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
the
government
have
a
position
on
that,
whether
you
can
combine
a
suit
against
the
united
states
under
the
tort
claims
act
with
a
suit
against
the
individual
officers
under
bivens.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
want
you
to
go
back
before
we
get
to
a
judgment.
can
such
a
suit
be
brought?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
this
lawyer
have
brought
the
ftca
act
complaint
and
pled
in
the
alternative
the
bivens
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
theory
would
cover
the
case
where
the
ftca
claim
drops
out
because
the
employee
didn't
file
the
administrative
claim
within
the...
what
is
it?
6
months?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
don't
they
have
a
short
span
where
they
have
to
bring
that
administrative
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
suit
is
tossed
out
because
one
of
those
deadlines
was
met.
it
would
follow,
i
think,
under
your
reasoning
that
there
could
be
no
subsequent
bivens
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
not...
there...
there
are
exceptions
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
you
could
have
tolling,
and
there
are
exceptions
to
a
preclusion
doctrine.
so
those
doctrines
aren't
complete
in
the
sense
that
they
are
without
exceptions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
would
at
the
end
of
the
road.
if...
if
you
go
to
the
bivens
claim
and
if
the
plaintiffs
prevail,
you
could
still
appeal
from
that
and
say
that
that
suit
was
barred.
it
should
never
have
gone
forward.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
no
question
that
it
would
be...
it
doesn't
die
if
you
don't
have
an
interlocutory
review.
it's
there
but
you've
wasted
a
lot
of
time
going
through
the
whole
trial
to
find
out
the
answer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
judge
said
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
1292(b)
certification,
but...
but
there's
cohen
against
beneficial
out
there.
why
don't
you
try
that
route?
it
was
the
district
judge
who...
who
mentioned
that
possibility,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
the
district...
the
district
judge
was
aware
of
cohen
against
beneficial,
and
i
think
referred
to
it.
maybe
i'm...
i
don't
remember
correctly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
but
he
mentioned
that
there
was...
he
mentioned
cohen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
perhaps
you
should
go
on
now
to
the
question,
assuming
that
it
is
immediately
appealable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we...
this
case
is
about
the
interpretation
of
2676,
as
we
took
it.
and
before
your
time
runs
out,
if
we
can
get
to
the
nub
of
your
difference,
your
reading
and
the
government's,
you
say
judgment
in
2676
means
judgment
on
the
merits,
and
the
government
says
it
means
any
judgment.
so
to
buy
your
interpretation,
we
would
have
to
put
a
caret
mark
after
judgment
and
put
on
the
merits.
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
bivens
suit
is
pretty
hard
to
prove,
a
lot
harder
than
proving
a
case
of
negligence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
2679(b)(2)
of
the
westfall
act
which
says
the
government
doesn't
get
substituted
for
the
employee
in
a
bivens
claim?
westfall...
the
congress
was...
was
quite
concerned,
it
seems,
with
preserving
an
action
brought
for
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
