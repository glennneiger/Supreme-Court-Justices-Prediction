we'll
hear
argument
first
in
will
v.
hallock.
mr.
hallward
driemeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
in
enacting
section
1291,
congress
specified
that
only
final
decisions
would
be
appealable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what
if
the
first
case
against
the
government
were
dismissed
because
of
a
finding
that
the
employee
was
acting
beyond
the
scope
of
his
authority?
should
that
really
bar
a
subsequent
action
against
the
employee
in
an
individual
capacity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
read
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
read
footnote
5.
you
said
it
didn't.
but
i
don't
see
how
that's
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
zieve.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what...
what's
wrong
with
the
government's
distinction
of
digital
that
here
you
have
a
policy
embodied
in
a
statute
as
opposed
to
a
private
settlement
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it...
is
it...
maybe
this
is
an
incorrect
way
to
look
at
it,
but
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
merits
and
the
interlocutory
review
decision.
i
would
suppose
if
we
agreed
on
the
merits
with
the
government...
in
other
words,
adopted
a
fairly
clear
and
categorical
rule...
the
need
for
an
interlocutory
appeal
would
diminish
because
the
district
courts
would
almost
always
get
it
right.
but
if
we
adopt
a
standard
for
the
application
of
this
bar
that,
you
know,
depends
on
a
lot
of
different
things,
then
the
appellate
court
is
going
to
disagree
with
the
district
court
in
a
greater
number
of
circumstances,
and
maybe
we
should
allow
an
interlocutory
review
of
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
you...
did
you
make
the
argument
or
the
point
that
justice
stevens
articulated
earlier
about
the...
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
not
applying
and
that
including
2676?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
sound
good
or
bad
to
you
now?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the...
as
a
practical
matter,
though,
what
is
the
great
burden
on
the
plaintiffs
in
requiring
them
to
sue
the
individual
defendants
first
if
they're
concerned
about
the
judgment
bar?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
don't...
you
don't
have
to
bring
them
simultaneously.
you
can
bring
the
individual
action
first,
separately.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hallward
driemeier,
you
have
5-and-a-half
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if...
if
they
decided
to
pursue
a
bivens
claims...
a
bivens
claim,
doesn't
the...
the
government
often
undertake
the
representation
of
the
government
employees
in
those
cases?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
in
no.
04-1332,
will
versus
hallock.
