justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
take
it
justice
ginsburg's
point...
and
it's
my
concern
as
well...
is
that
if
the
bivens
action
is
brought
first,
there's
no
protection
of
the
government
against
multiple
actions.
so...
so
the
policy
that
you're
arguing
for
just
is
dependent
on
which
suit
happens
to
be
brought
first.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
not...
that's
not
a
very
strong
policy
interest
to
vindicate
by
expanding
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
depends
on...
it
depends
on...
on
how
the
case
was
resolved.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what...
what
significance
do
you
give
to
the
word
to
complete,
as
to
whether
it's
a
complete
bar?
doesn't
that
indicate
that
the...
the
statute
is...
is
a
bar
to
all...
all
further
actions
after
a
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
the
petitioners
requested
it.
did...
did
you
oppose
that
request
below?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
i...
i
thought...
i
thought
the
district
court
said
i'm
going
to
deny
the
motion
to
certify
because
the
issue
is
clear
in
my
view,
but
if
you
think
you
have
a
collateral
order
doctrine,
then
go
ahead
and
take
your
appeal.
