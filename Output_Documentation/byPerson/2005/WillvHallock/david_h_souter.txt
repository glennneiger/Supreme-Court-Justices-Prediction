david
h.
souter
well,
you
can...
you
can
say
the
same
thing
of...
of
res
judicata,
that
there
is
a
complete
bar.
i
guess
my
concern
here
is
that
this
seems
to
be,
with
respect
to
the
employee,
something
much
closer
to
a
res
judicata
case
than
to
an
immunity
per
se
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
digital
i
remember.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm...
i'm
assuming
that
it's
not
res
judicata
in...
in
the
narrow
sense
of
the
doctrine,
but
it's...
it's
still
a
bar
that
depends
upon
a...
a
prior
judgment.
and
in
that
respect,
it's
sort
of
res
judicata
like.
conversely,
there
is...
there
is
no
immunity
in
the
first
instance
conferred
directly
on
the
employee
as
such.
and
so
that's...
that's
why
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
an
argument
that
this
is
a
lot
closer
to
res
judicata
than
it
is
to
classic
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
a
double
jeopardy
claim
is...
is
a
claim
in
which
there
is
an...
a...
an
immunity
textually
conferred
by
the...
the
constitution,
or
at
least,
we...
we
have
thought
it...
the
guarantee
does
not
make
an
awful
lot
of
practical
sense,
unless
you
read
it
that
way.
you
don't
have
that...
that
situation
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit.
richard
hallock’s
credit-card
information
was
stolen
and
used
to
pay
the
fee
on
a
child-pornography
website.
based
on
this
information,
customs
agents
executed
a
search
warrant
at
his
house
and
seized
various
pieces
of
computer
equipment.
no
criminal
charges
were
brought;
but
the
equipment
was
returned
damaged,
and
all
of
the
stored
data
were
lost.
as
a
result,
the
computer-software
company
that
richard
hallock’s
wife,
susan,
owned
and
operated
from
home
was
forced
out
of
business.
susan
hallock
sued
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
alleging
negligence
by
the
agents
in
making
the
search.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
after
finding
that
the
agents’
behavior
fell
within
an
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
in
the
meantime,
susan
hallock
also
filed
a
so-called
bivens
action
against
the
individual
agents
involved
in
the
search.
after
the
district
court
ruled
for
the
government
in
the
first
suit,
the
agents
sought
to
have
the
bivens
suit
thrown
out
by
invoking
the
judgment
bar
of
the
tort
claims
act.
the
judgment
bar
precludes
action
against
federal
employees
on
the
same
subject
matter
as
a
concluded
prior
suit
brought
against
the
government
under
the
act
itself.
the
district
court
found
that
the
judgment
bar
was
not
applicable,
and
the
2nd
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
judgment
bar
applied,
but
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
vacate
for
want
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
even
though
the
suit
against
the
agents
was
still
pending,
appellate
jurisdiction
was
said
to
exist
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
that
doctrine
permits
appeals
from
a
small
class
of
rulings
that
do
not
conclude
litigation,
but
conclusively
decide
an
issue
separate
from
the
merits
that
would
be
effectively
unreviewable
on
appeal.
examples
of
such
orders
include
those
denying
claims
of
the
absolute
immunity,
qualified
immunity,
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
double
jeopardy.
there
is
a
temptation
to
extrapolate
from
these
examples
to
a
rule
that
collateral
appeal
is
available
whenever
a
party
is
claiming
a
right
to
win
in
advance
of
trial.
but
if
this
temptation
is
not
resisted,
as
we
explained
in
our
earlier
digital-equipment
case,
just
about
every
pretrial
order
could
be
described
as
denying
a
claim
to
avoid
trial,
and
the
general
rule
requiring
one
appeal
at
the
end
of
the
litigation
would
be
reduced
to
tatters.
thus,
we
clarify
today
that
it
is
not
just
the
avoidance
of
trial
that
counts
when
deciding
if
a
preliminary
order
is
immediately
appealable;
for
appealability,
there
has
to
be
something
more.
it
has
to
be
shown
that
the
failure
to
allow
immediate
appeal
would
imperil
a
substantial
public
interest.
there
is
no
such
public
interest
at
stake
here,
simply
because
the
judgment
bar
of
the
tort
claims
act
was
held
to
be
inapplicable.
the
government
likens
this
order
to
one
denying
qualified
immunity,
but
that
is
not
a
good
analogy.
if
susan
hallock
had
brought
her
bivens
action
and
no
other,
the
agents
could
not
possibly
claim
a
right
not
to
stand
trial.
the
judgment
bar,
therefore,
is
more
like
rules
of
claim
preclusion
than
rules
of
immunity,
and
we
have
said
before
that
orders
denying
claim
preclusions
do
not
fit
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
thus,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
appellate
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
and
we
vacate
its
judgment
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
