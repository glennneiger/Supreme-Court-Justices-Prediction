mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
enacting
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
congress
recognized
that
suits
against
federal
employees,
based
upon
their
official
conduct,
constituted
a
very
real
attack
upon
the
morale
of
the
civil
service.
congress
addressed
that
concern
in
two
ways.
first,
it
allowed
plaintiffs
to
sue
the
united
states
directly,
but
secondly
and
importantly,
it
provided
that
a
plaintiff
who
took
up
that
opportunity,
the
judgment
in
the
suit
against
the
united
states
would
constitute
a
complete
bar
to
any
action
against
the
employee.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
this
court
has
adopted
a
practical
rather
than
technical
construction
of
that
statute.
and
the
court
has
recognized
in...
in
numerous
cases
that
claims
of
official
immunity
are...
warrant
immediate
appellate
review
because
they
can
only
be
effectively
vindicated
by
review
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage.
and...
and
that
is
the
kind
of
protection
that
section
2676
provides.
it
establishes
that
the
judgment
in
the
suit
against
the
united
states
shall
be
a
complete
bar
against
any
action
against
the
employee.
so
it's
the
action
itself
that
is
precluded,
and
it
is
precluded
completely.
and
that--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
the...
the
court
recognized
in
the
digital
equipment
case
that
even
a
claim
of
res
judicata
could
correctly
be
characterized
as
a
right
to
be
free
from
suit,
but
it
said
that
that
wasn't
enough.
one
had
to
look
at
the
importance
of
the...
of
the
value
protected,
and
the--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--and...
and
the
court--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i'm
sure
you
do.
and
the
court
has
recognized
in
any
number
of
cases
that
claims
of
official
immunity
are
the
kind
that
present
sufficiently
important
public
interests
to
warrant
an
exception
to
the...
the
otherwise
rule
that
appeals
can
only
be
had
at
the
final
judgment.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
this
is
like
the
other
claims
of
immunity
that
the
court
has
recognized
warrant
collateral
appeal
in
mitchell
v.
forsyth
or
nixon
v.
fitzgerald.
it's
a
kind
of
official--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
right,
your
honor.
we
point
out
any
number
of
ways
in
which
section
2676
confers
an
immunity
on
employees
that
is
broader
than
the
traditional
common
law
rule
of
res
judicata.
for
example,
res
judicata
would
not
bar
a
suit
against
another
party
that
could
not
have
been
joined
in
the
first
suit,
but
by
its
plain
terms,
section
2676
would
bar
such
a
claim.
likewise,
common
law
res
judicata
would
not
bar
a
second
suit
to...
to
recover
a
kind
of
damages
that
were
unavailable
in
the
first,
but
whereas
punitive
damages
are
unavailable
in
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
section
2676
would
plainly
bar
a
second
suit
against
the
employee
to
cover
punitive
damages.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
certainly
there
is
no
categorical
rule
that
claims
in
the
nature
of
claim
preclusion
are
not
eligible
for
immediate
appeal
under
collateral
order.
in
abney
v.
united
states,
for
example,
the
court
upheld
immediate
appeal
of
the
denial
of
a...
of
a
double
jeopardy
claim,
which
likewise
depends
upon
the
existence
of
a
prior
action.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
the
constitution
does
not
use
the
word
immunity,
nor
does
the
westfall
act
use
the
word
immunity.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
like
the
claim
of
double
jeopardy
in
abney,
the
claim
of
immunity
here
depends
upon
the
existence
of
a
prior
litigation,
but
as
in
abney,
the...
the
interests
that
it
protects
are
the
interests
to
be
free
from
the...
the
cost
burdens
distraction
of
litigation.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i'm
not
sure
that--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
it...
it's...
it's
not
entirely
clear
that
the
united
states
would
be
subject
to
a
second
suit.
it...
the...
the
susceptibility
of
the
united
states
to
a
further
suit
would
be
governed
by
collateral--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's...
that's
right.
but...
but
what's
important
here
is
that
the
interest
protected
is
the
interest
of
the
employee
against
the...
the
distraction...
against
the
attack
on
morale.
that
was
the
language
that
the
assistant
attorney
general
used.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
your
honor,
the...
the
statute
protects
against
the...
the
cost
of
repetitive
litigation,
the
harassment
of
the
employee
of
multiple
suits.
these
are
the
exact
same
types
of
interest
that
the
court
has
recognized--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--it...
well,
in
this
particular
ftca
claim,
there...
there
was
no
discovery.
but
as
we
point
out
in...
in
our
brief,
ftca
cases,
even
those
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
the
2680
exceptions,
are
often
resolved
only
after
years
of
litigation,
including
often
trial.
so...
so
the
harassment
is...
is
the
same.
on...
on
respondents'
view,
the
judgment
bar
would
not
kick
in.
for
example,
in
a
case
like
varig
airlines,
where
this
court
upheld
the
government's
assertion
of
the...
the
discretionary
function
exception
only
after
8
years
of
litigation
when
the
case
had
been...
gone
to
the
ninth
circuit
two
times
where
there
had
been
a
trial
and
final
judgment
and--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--it
would
certainly
involve
the
employee.
any
trial
would...
would
inevitably
involve
the
employee
in
discovery,
in...
in
appearing
at
trials
as
a
witness.
the...
the
government
also
is
protected
by
section
2676,
as
the
assistant
attorney
general
said.
the...
the
burden
on
the
government,
because
the
government
is
often
called
upon
to
defend
employees
against
suit...
and...
and
the
government,
having
litigated
once
and
obtained
a
judgment
in
the
first
ftca
suit,
should
not
be
forced
to
expend
all
those
resources
again
in
a
second
suit,
this
time
styled
as
one
against
the
employee.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
yes.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
2676
makes
the...
the
scope
of
its
application
turn
on
whether
there
has
been
a
judgment
and
an
action
under
section
1346(b).
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
your
honor,
the...
that
view
of
the
language,
shall
not
apply,
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions
both
in
united
states
v.
smith
and
in
fdic
v.
meyer.
in
united
states
v.
smith,
for
example,
the
plaintiffs
had
made
exactly
that
argument
with
respect
to
shall
not
apply.
they
said
that...
that
1346
shall
not
apply
to
an
action
that
arises
in
a
foreign
country.
therefore,
section
1346
cannot
provide
the
remedy
to
which
we
are
supposed
to
be
limited.
and
the
court
rejected
precisely
that
argument.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
what
they--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
take
another
example
why...
why
you
couldn't
read
the...
the
shall
not
apply
language
in
that
way.
the
first
exclusivity
provision
of
section
2679(a)
with
respect
to
sue
and
be
sued
agencies...
if
you
said
that
1346(b)
shall
not
apply
to
a
suit
against
the
postal
service
because
the
suits
against
the
postal
service
regarding
miscarriage
of
letters
is
excluded
from
1346(b)
by
that
same
language,
shall
not
apply,
well,
that
would
render
the
postal
service
exception
meaningless
and
you
would
sue
the...
the
postal
service
pursuant
to
its
sue
and
be
sued
authority
instead
of
suing
the
united
states
under
1346(b).
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
the...
the...
2679(a)
says
that
the
authority
of
an
agency
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
its
own
name
shall
not
extend
to
claims
cognizable
under
section
1346(b).
the
argument
might
be
made,
with
respect
to
a
suit
against
the
postal
service
for
miscarriage
of
the
mail,
that...
that
claim
is
not
cognizable
under
section
1346(b)
because
section
2680(b)
says
that
1346(b)
shall
not
apply
to
claims
related
to
the
miscarriage
of
mail.
so
by
the
same
reading
of
shall
not
apply,
one
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that...
that
the
claim
relating
to
the
miscarriage
of
mail
is
not
cognizable
under
1346(b),
and
therefore
you
sue
the...
the
postal
service.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
and...
and
a...
a
claim
with
respect
to
the
miscarriage
of
mail
is
one
that
comes
within
the
exception.
and
so
that
reading
of
shall
not
apply
has
been
rejected
by
the
court
in
smith
v.
united
states,
likewise
is
inconsistent
with
the
court's
decision,
fdic
v.
meyer,
and
would
render
it
simply
ridiculous
with
respect
to
claims
against
the
postal
service.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
right.
and...
and--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--exactly,
and
in
that
sense,
that
reading
of
shall
not
apply
is
simply
inconsistent
with
the
court's
holding
in
united
states
v.
smith.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
think
what
it...
what
it
means
is
that...
what
it...
what
it
has
been
understood
to
mean
is
that
the
united
states'
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
it...
the
united
states
has
not
subjected
itself
to
liability
on
claims
of
the
nature
of
those
exceptions.
and
that's
how
the
court
has
described
it
in
any
number
of
cases,
that
the
exceptions
in
2680
mark
the
limits
of
the
extent
to
which
the
united
states--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
there--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--there
are
any
number
of
things
wrong
in
our
view.
first,
congress
has,
as
your
honor
recognized,
created
an
express
exception
for
bivens
claims
in
2679(b),
but
it
has
created
no
similar
exception
to...
to
2676
even
though
prior
to
passage
of
the
westfall
act,
any
number
of
courts
of
appeals
had
construed
2676
to
apply
to
bivens
claims.
further,
as
respondents
recognize,
2676's
application
at
this
point
is
virtually
limited
because
of
the
westfall
act
to
a
second
case
that
raises
a
bivens
claim.
so
their--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
obviously
that...
that
issue
is
not
presented
here
because
here
we
have
two
separate
litigation--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--but--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
the...
the
consistent
view
of
the
courts
of
appeals
and
district
courts
over
50
years
has
been
that
the
judgment
bar
does
have
some
application
even
when
the
claims
are
litigated
simultaneously.
for
example,
it's
the
universal
rule
among
those
courts
of
appeals
that
have
decided
the
issue
that
if
the
plaintiff
obtains
a
judgment
against
the
united
states,
that
that
judgment
immediately--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--can
it
be
brought?
it
can
be
brought.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it...
it
can
certainly
be
brought
because
the
judgment
bar
only
comes
into
effect
when
there's
been
a
judgment.
so
it
could
be
brought.
but
as
i
was
saying,
the...
the
courts
are
unanimous
in
holding
that
if
both
of
those
claims
were
to
proceed
through
litigation
and
to
trial
and
there
were
to
be
a
judgment
in
the
action
under
the
ftca
against
the
united
states,
that
that
would
immediately
bar
any
recovery
against
the
employee.
and
that's
been
the
view,
again,
for
some
50
years
now.
so--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
in...
in
a
footnote--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--in
our
brief
we
suggest
it
might
not--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--and...
and
in
fact,
in...
in
re
reading
fdic
v.
meyer
in
preparation
for
oral
argument,
footnote
7
of
that
decision
suggests
that
that
would
be
a
judgment
in
an
action
under
1346(b).
fdic
v.
meyer
was
saying
that
it
would,
nonetheless,
be
cognizable
under
1346(b)
because
the
allegation
was
that
they
were
acting
within
the
scope.
so...
so
perhaps
we
should
not
have
conceded
that.
but
it
could
still
be
that
the...
the
judgment
bar
wouldn't
apply.
it
would
be
an
action
in...
under...
a
judgment
in
an
action
under
1346(b),
but
the
judgment
bar
protects
an
employee
of
the
government.
and...
and
that's
a
defined
term
and
it's
defined
in
the
way
that
suggests
the
person
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment,
advancing
the
purposes
of
the
agency.
so
there...
there
might
be
a
reason
why
the
judgment
bar
itself
would
not
apply
to
a
claim
where
the
determination
was
that
the
person
was
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it...
your
honor,
it
would
not,
i
think,
cover
a
claim
that...
where
the
dismissal
was
curable,
where
the
person
could
go
and
exhaust
their
claim.
but
the
test
of
whether--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--they
have...
they
have
2
years
to
bring
the
administrative
claim.
they
have
6
months
to
bring
the
suit
in
court
after
the
administrative
claim
has
been
resolved.
and
the...
the
reason--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
right.
the...
the
statute
makes
the
test
whether
there
has
been
a
judgment
in
an
action
under
1346(b),
and
plainly,
under
any
reading
of
that
language,
it
means
where
there
is
a
judgment
that
finally
resolves
the
liability
of
the
united
states
under
section
1346(b),
there
has
been
a
judgment
in
an
action
under
1346(b).
and
i
don't
think
that
the
language
is
susceptible
to
any
other
reading.
so
if
the
claim,
as
your
honor
suggested,
finally
resolves
whether
the
united
states
could
be
liable
under
section
1346(b),
then
the
judgment
bar
applies.
unless
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i...
i
think
i'm
going
to
borrow
justice
breyer's
response
because
it's...
it's
a
little
clearer
than
the...
than
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
and
that...
by
that
same
logic,
that
would
mean
that
the
provisions
of
2679(b)
would
not
apply
to
the
claim,
and
that
is--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--precisely
the
question
that
was
addressed
in...
in
united
states
v.
smith,
and
the
court
said
that...
that
it
did
apply.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
but
if
2679(b)
did
not
apply,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
substituting
the
united
states
and
having
the
claim
dismissed.
and
that
was
precisely
the
issue
that
was
addressed
in...
in
united
states
v.
smith.
so...
so
plainly
you
cannot
read
it
to
mean
that...
that
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
ftca
are
simply
a
nullity
or
nugatory
with
respect
to
such
a
claim.
that...
that...
rather,
as
your
honor
suggested,
what
it
means
is
that
the
united
states
has
not
waived
its
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
but
in
fdic
v.
meyer,
the
court
was
very
clear
that
the
ftca
is
the
kind
of
case
which
defines
jurisdiction
by
the
scope
of
the
waiver
of
immunity
and
to...
the
claims
to
which
the
united
states
has
rendered
itself
liable.
so...
so
all
of
those
issues
are
interrelated,
and...
and
it
reflects
the
substantive
nature
of
those
exclusions.
it
could
not
be--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--it
is
true
that--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the...
the--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--2679(b)
applies
only
to...
to
state
law
causes
of
action.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
certainly--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--we...
we
believe
that
united
states
v.
smith
was
right,
and
that
shall
not
apply
cannot
have
the
meaning
that
justice
stevens
was
trying
to
attribute
to
it
for
that
reason.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
respondents
concede
that
the
westfall
act
confers
a
form
of
official
immunity.
that
statute,
like
2676,
does
not
use
the
word
immunity.
rather,
it
uses
the
word,
any
action
related
to
the
same
subject
matter
is
precluded.
and
that
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
language
of
2676
that...
that
establishes
a
complete
bar
to
any
action
by
reason
of
the
same
subject
matter.
so
there
is
no
requirement
that
congress
invoked
particular
language
to
create
an
immunity.
the
question
is
what
are
the
underlying
concerns
that
are
protected.
and
the
respondents
have
admitted
that
2676,
like
the
westfall
act,
was
intended
to
protect
employee
morale
against
the
threat
of
personal
liability
when
they
were
acting
for
the
government,
as
well
as
the
distraction
and
cost
of
defending
against
suit.
this
court,
in
fact,
in
gilman--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
i...
i
admit
that
congress--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--congress
addressed
the...
only
part
of...
of
the
problem.
but
as
justice
stevens
recognized,
plaintiffs
would
want
to
sue
the
solvent
defendant,
and
that's
why
the...
making
the
government
itself
subject
to
suit
was
part
of
the
deal.
and...
and
congress
understood
that
plaintiffs
were
going
to
take
up
that
option.
and
that's
why,
up
until
the...
this
court's
adoption
of
bivens,
there
were
virtually
no
decisions
about
2676
because
plaintiffs
just
didn't
try.
this
court
in
gilman,
an
early
case
relating
to
2676,
recognizes
that...
that
the
statutory
provision
was
intended
to
address
precisely
these
types
of
concerns,
morale
of
employees,
the
same
concerns
that
have
led
this
court
and
congress
in
other
contexts
to
recognize
other
forms
of...
of
official
immunity.
and
this
one
is
equally
subject
to
immediate
review.
respondents
suggest,
considering
for
a
moment,
what
congress
would
have
expected
in
1946
when
it
initially
enacted
this,
and...
and
i
think
that
that
is
helpful.
there
is...
it
is
quite
clear
2676
is
explicit,
that
congress
did
not
expect
the
end
of
the
litigation
against
the
united
states
under
the
ftca
to
mark
the
beginning
of
the
litigation
against
the
employee
in
his
personal
suit.
and...
and
respondents
offer
the
example
of
the
postal
carrier
as
one
of
those
quintessential
cases
that
congress
meant
to
address.
but,
of
course,
the
postal
exception
to
the
ftca,
another
exception
in
2680,
2680(b),
would
bar
many
claims
against
the
united
states
relating
to
a
postal
carrier's
misdirection
of
the
mail.
now,
respondents
would
have
the
court
believe
that
if
that
suit
was
brought
against
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
was
found
not
to
be
liable
because
of
that
exception,
that
the
plaintiffs
were
free...
and
congress
intended
that
the
plaintiff
be
free...
to
then
go
sue
the
poor
mail
carrier
himself
personally.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
with
respect
to
section
2676,
bivens
claims
today,
after
the
enactment
of
the
westfall
act,
stand
in
the
same
footing
as
common
law
claims
stood
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
westfall
act.
in
other
words,
prior
to
westfall,
you
could
bring
a
common
law
claim
against
an
employee,
but
if
you
brought
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
the
judgment
in
that
suit
would
bar
the
common
law
claim
against
the
employee.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiff
had
to
make
a
choice.
likewise,
when
congress
enacted
westfall
and
said
you
no
longer
have
a
choice
with
respect
to
common
law
claims,
those
have
to
be
brought
against
the
united
states,
it
left
the
plaintiffs
with
a
choice
with
respect
to
constitutional
claims.
they
could
choose
to
pursue
a
bivens
remedy,
but
if
they
sue
the
united
states
on
those
claims,
the
judgment
and
the
action
under
1346
would
be
a
complete
bar
to
any
action
against
the
employee.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
and
an
additional
concern
of
congress
was
that
the
government
would
be
forced
to
defend
against
the
suit
twice.
in
effect,
the
cost
of
litigation
might
be
borne
by
the
government
in
both
cases.
