justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
can
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
basic
question
that
i
don't
really
think
is
adequately
addressed
in
the
briefs?
you
contend,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
exception
in
2680(c)
covers
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
2680...
the
introductory
language
of
2680
is
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
shall
not
apply
to
such
cases.
and
is
it
not
true
that
2676
is
in
this
chapter,
and
does
it
not,
therefore,
follow
that
2676
does
not
apply
to
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
first
question
is
how
does
2676
apply
if
it's
in
the
chapter
that
2680
says
shall
not
apply
to...
to
things
in
the
exception?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
held
that
the...
the
action
simply
didn't
apply
in...
in
that
case.
there
was
no...
there
was
no
recovery
under
the...
basically
it
held
the
foreign...
foreign
country
exception
precluded
the
statute
from
applying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
is
what
also
happens
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
it
only
says
it
shall
not
apply
if
it
comes
within
the
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
like
to
pursue
the
question
i
asked
you
earlier
because
i
really
didn't
fully
understand
your
answer.
it
seems
to
me,
as
i
read
2680,
it
simply
says
that
if
one
of
the
exceptions
applies,
there's
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
basically.
that's
what...
what
the
scope
of
it
is.
and
therefore,
none
of
the
other
provisions
of...
of
this
chapter
apply,
and
if
none
of
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
apply,
clearly
the
judgment
bar
provision
is
one
of
those.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
follows
that
2679(b)
does
not
apply,
but
you're
just
have...
working
on
a
blank
slate
with
no
provision
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
affecting
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
or
imposing
any
kind
of
judgment
bar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
main
holding
in
smith
was
that
the
foreign
country
exception
applied.
that's
all
they
held
in
smith,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the...
and
the
plaintiff
couldn't...
i
don't
see
how
that
is
at
all
inconsistent
with
what
i'm
suggesting
here.
i
really
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
looking
at
it
very
broadly,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
if
the
united
states
did
not
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
a
particular
category
of
tort
case,
that
a
dismissal
of
such
a
tort
case
should
bar
an...
an
action
by
an
individual
against
an
individual
defendant,
just
looking
at
it
in...
in
a
global
sense.
and
that's
what
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
also
says.
so
i
don't
really
see
any
tension.
i...
maybe
i'm
missing
something
obvious
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
plaintiffs,
generally,
like
to
sue...
sue
solvent
defendants
too
i
think.
[laughter]
