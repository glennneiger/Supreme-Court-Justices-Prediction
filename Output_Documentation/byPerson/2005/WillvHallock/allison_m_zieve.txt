ms.
allison
m.
zieve
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
to
begin
with,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
final
judgment
rule
to
review
the
district
court's
order.
petitioners
do
not
contest
that
they
could
have
been
sued
under
bivens
initially
or
that
the
hallocks
could
have
filed
simultaneous
ftca
claims
and
a
bivens
claim.
petitioners'
argument
is
that
they
cannot
now
be
sued
only
because
the
hallocks
first
filed
a
different
suit
against
the
united
states.
that
situation,
which
hinges
on
the
sequence
of
lawsuits,
does
not
describe
an
immunity
or
a
right
not
to
stand
trial.
petitioners
try
hard
to
paint
the
purpose
of
the
judgment
bar
as
the
same
as
the
purpose
of
qualified
immunity,
avoiding
distraction
and
inhibition
of
federal
employees
from
their
work.
but--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--i
don't
think
complete
bar
means
anything
more
than
bar.
res
judicata
is
a
complete
bar
and
a
statute
of
limitations
is
a
complete
bar.
and
i...
i
think
the
statute
would
mean
the
same
thing
without
that
word.
and
there's--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--that's
right,
but
when...
when
the
bar
applies,
it's...
it's
an
absolute
bar.
i
don't...
i
agree
that
if
the
bar
has
been
triggered,
it
is
a...
it
completely
precludes
any
further
action
on
any
claims,
but
i
don't
think
the
word
complete
gives
us
much
guidance
about
when
the
bar
is
triggered.
and
the
purpose
behind
the
bar
generally
is
not
the
same
as
the
purpose
of
qualified
immunity
because
although
the
ftca,
in
general,
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
ftca
indicates
that
the
act
as
a
whole
was
intended
to
protect
employee
morale
and
distraction
from
employment,
that's
not
the
purpose
behind
the
judgment
bar.
and
the
judgment
bar
would
be
a
poor
vehicle
for
accomplishing
that
purpose
since
it
allows
not
only
a
bivens
suit
as
an
initial
matter
and,
when
it
was
enacted,
allowed...
still
allowed
employees
to
be
sued
for
state
torts,
but
also
would
allow
two
suits,
as
long
as
the
bivens
suit
were
litigated
before.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--i
don't--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
a
couple
things.
first
of
all,
the...
the
bar
to
state
law
tort
suits
is
in
2679(b),
which
was
passed
in
1988,
42
years
after
the
judgment
bar
and
the...
and
the
bulk
of
ftca.
it
was
passed
as
an
express
effort
to
overturn
this
court's
decision
in
westfall,
which
held
that
employees
did
not
have
immunity
from
state
law...
certain
state
law
torts.
and
in
the
findings
that
are
incorporated
into
section
2
of
the
statute,
congress
specifically
called
2679(b)
an
immunity
provision,
and
this
court
has
since
recognized
that,
for
instance,
in
gutierrez
de
martinez.
there
is
no
comparable
legislative
history
indicating
immunity
for...
for...
under
2676.
so
i...
i
don't
think
it's
that
complicated
to
figure
out
now
whether
someone
is
proceeding...
whether
the
claim
arises...
whether
the
claim
to
appealability,
whether
the
defense
arises
under
2679(b)
or
under
the
judgment
bar
because
they
just
really
get
at
very
different
things.
and
the
courts
haven't
shown...
there's
not
a
lot
of
case
law
in
either
direction,
but
the...
the
courts
haven't
exhibited
much
confusion
about
that.
the
other
thing
is
that
when
you're...
when
you're
construing
the
scope
of
the
judgment
bar,
it's
important
to
remember
that
this
was
passed
in
1946,
and
it
was
intended...
at
that
time
some
25
years...
35
years
before
bivens,
what
the...
what
congress
was
getting
at
was
state
law
suits
against
the
employees
versus
state
law
suits
against
the
united
states.
and
the
effort
was
to
shift
the
liability
to
the
united
states.
that
effort
to
shift
liability,
yes,
was
for
morale,
to
protect
employees
from
being
distracted,
but
that...
that
was,
again,
the
purpose
of
the
shift
of
liability,
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
general.
the
only
real
explanation
of
the
judgment
bar
appears
in
the
background
of
where
the
drafters
explained
that
the
bar
is
intended
to...
as
a
bar
to...
bar
to
further
suit
not
only
against
the
government,
as
would
have
been
true
under
the
prior
bill.
this
is
around
page
14
of
my
brief,
the
quote
from...
from
the
1945
report.
not...
a
bar
to
liability
not
only
against
the
government,
as
would
have
been
true
under
the
prior
version,
but
also
against
the
employee.
and
there
was
no
bar
to
suit
in
the
prior
version
of
the
bill.
so
the
drafters'
explanation
could
only
have
been
referring
to
the
normal
operation
of
res
judicata.
and
this
court
has
used
res
judicata
in
digital
as
sort
of
the
quintessential
example
of
a
defense
that
is
not
subject
to
immediate
appeal.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--that's
right
because
defense
is
based
on
the
order
of
suits.
those
are
preclusion
defenses,
and
preclusion
defenses
are
not
immediately
appealable.
and,
you
know,
i
think
this
follows
from
the
court's
decision
in...
in
irwin
that...
that
certain
defenses
that
are
available
to
private
parties
in
litigation
should
also
be
available,
treated
the
same
way,
have
the
same
rules
when
the
government
is
being
sued
like
a
private
party.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the...
digital
explains
that
if
you
have
a
right
not
to
stand
trial
that
is
set
forth
in
a
statute
or
constitutional
provision,
that
the
court
isn't
going
to
second
guess
the
importance
of
that
right.
it's...
it's
unclear
whether
the
importance
prong
of
the
collateral
order
test
should
be
part
of...
part
of
that
effective
reviewability
or
whether
it's
part
of
the
second
prong
about
separate
from
the
merits
of
the
case.
but
in
any
event,
what
digital
doesn't
say
is
just
because
something
is
in
a
statute...
a
right
is
in
a
statute...
it's...
it...
it
is
correct
to
characterize
it
as
a
right
not
to
stand
trial.
to
the
contrary,
digital
cautions
that
so
many
defenses
could
be
called
rights
not
to
stand
trial,
and
so
the
court
will
look...
will
apply
the
test
very
stringently.
statute
of
limitations,
for
instance,
are
in
statutes
and
when
the
statute
has
expired,
you
could
say
that
is
a
statutory
bar
to
a
right
to
stand
trial.
but
statute
of
limitations,
like
the
res
judicata
defense,
are
just
not
appealable
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's
right.
if
there's
no
appellate
court
jurisdiction,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
go
on
to
construe
the
scope
of
the
judgment
bar.
but--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that's
exactly
why
this
defense
is
effectively
reviewable
after
final
judgment
as
opposed
to
now.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's
true
to
this...
just
as
is
true
with
defenses
based
on
statute
of
limitations
or
res
judicata
or,
you
know,
a
whole
host
of
defenses--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--the
district
court
could
have
certified
it
and...
and--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--yes.
the
district
court
denied
that.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
don't
know.
i
don't
remember.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
actually
the
petitioners
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
before
the
1292(b)
motion
had
been
decided
and
then
sought
a
1292(b)
certification.
i
think
they
were
trying
to
protect
themselves
by
doing
it
both
ways--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
i
don't
think
he
expressed
any
view
about
whether
the
case
satisfied
the
cohen
doctrine.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes,
but
he...
he
didn't
think
the
issue
warranted
an
immediate
appeal.
he
made
that
clear
by
denying
the
1292(b)
motion.
and...
and
i
think
that
would
have
been
the...
the
appropriate
way
to
appeal
would
have
been
1292(b),
and
having
been
denied
that
route,
petitioners
should
wait
till
the
end
of
the
case
because,
as
you
say,
this
issue
will
be
effectively
reviewable
at
the
conclusion
of
the
litigation.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
court's
cases
allowing
and
disallowing
collateral
order
appeals
don't
turn
on
the...
the
litigation
efficiencies
that
will
be
obtained
if
the
court
goes
forward,
but
rather
on
whether
the
issue
or
the
defense
that...
that
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
appeal
actually
fits
the
stringent
requirements
of
the
cohen
doctrine.
and
the
court
has,
in
its
more
recent
cases,
cautioned
against
broadening
collateral
order
appeals
and
indicated
that
1292(b)
and
the
rule's
enabling
act
provisions
2092
that
allows
the
court
to
identify
categories
of
cases
that
are
appropriate
for
interlocutory
appeal
as
a
categorical
matter,
but
those
are
the
preferred
ways
to
go
rather
than
stretching
the
final
judgment
rule
really
beyond
the
bounds
of
its
language.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
if
the
court
reaches
the
second
question,
the
res
judicata
foundation
of
the
bar
shows
as
well
why
the
second
circuit's
decision
on
the
substantive
question
should
be
affirmed.
the...
the
text...
the
language
of
the
text
uses
classic
res
judicata
terminology,
judgment
and
bar,
and
the
historical
context
of
the
statute
makes
that
reading
by
far
the
most
reasonable.
the...
when
the
act
was
passed
in...
in
1946,
until
then,
federal
employees
had
been
sued
for
state
law
torts,
the
biggest
category
of
cases
involving
auto
accidents
with
postal
workers.
and
congress
set
about
trying
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
so
that
the
government
could
step
in
to
defend
the
suits
and
be
sued
in
their
place,
which
it
thought
was
fair
and
would
help
morale.
and
so
that
plaintiffs
would
no
longer
have
to
seek
private
bills
in
congress,
which
was
considered
a...
a
burden.
when
the...
when
the...
the
ftca
allows
the
united
states
to
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
employee
for
purposes
of
a
state
law
tort
suit.
and
then
the
judgment
bar
extends
to
the
employee
the
preclusion
benefit
of
that
suit
so
that
the
employee
gets
the
same
res
judicata
effect
that
he
would
have
had
absent
the
shift
of...
of
the
defense
to
the
government.
the...
again,
the...
the
one
clear
explanation
in
the
background
for
why
the
judgment...
what
the
judgment
bar
does
is
that
it...
it
applies
to
the
employee
the
same
bar
that
would
have
applied
to
the
government
under...
under
prior
bills
which,
again,
was
only
the
bar
of
res
judicata.
because
res--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--no,
we
didn't
make
it,
and--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--we
did
make
a
similar
argument
that
2680
states
that
1346(b)
shall
not
apply
and
because
the
judgment
bar
only
applies
to
actions
under
1346(b),
it's
something
of
a
contradiction
to
say
that
an
action
that...
to
which
1346(b)
shall
not
apply
at
the
same
time
an
action
under
1346(b).
as
for
justice
stevens'
broader
argument
that...
that
chapter...
chapter
171,
which
is
the
rest
of
the
ftca,
other
than...
than
1346(b),
shall
not...
shall
not
apply
to
claims
arising
from
the
exceptions,
i
don't
think
that
smith,
which
i
think
was
mr.
hallward
driemeier's
response...
smith
doesn't
really
provide
a
full
answer
to
why
that
argument
might
be
wrong
because
smith
really...
smith
did
say
that
an
action
that...
an
action
to
which
the
chapter
does
not
apply
at
the
same
time
can
be
one
to
which
the
exclusive
remedy
provision
has
been
applied.
but
one
difference
is
the...
the
order
in
which
those
things
happened.
first,
you
would
get
the
2679(b)
exclusive
remedy
provision
invoked
before
the
question
of
whether
2680
applied
would
arise.
and
the
other
point
is
that
smith,
which
construed
the
exclusive
remedy
provision
to
apply
even
if
the
exceptions
would
then
preclude
a
suit
entirely,
was
based
on
the
purpose
of
the
exclusive
remedy
provision.
the
legislative
history's
relatively
clear
statements
that
it
was
intended
to
provide
an
immunity
from
state
law
tort
suits
for
federal
employees
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment
and
looks
to
two
other
provisions
of
2679,
neither
of
which
would
come...
have
any
role
here
or
were
even
adopted
or
enacted
until
42
years
after
the
judgment
bar
was
enacted.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
like
application
of
the
judgment
bar,
one
distinction
would
be
that
it
turns
on
the
order
in
which
things
occur,
and
in--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--but
the
reasoning--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
the
reasoning
of
smith
is
not
based
on
the
language
of
2680.
the
reasoning
of
smith
is
based
on
the
statement
of
legislative
purpose,
the
background
under
which
2679(b)
was
enacted,
and
based
on
2679(b)(2),
which
has...
stating
exceptions,
and
2679(d)(4),
which
has
procedures
for
the
united
states
to
certify
and
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
united
states.
so--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--right.
what
the
court
did
in
smith...
and
i
think
this
applies
to
much
of
the
court's
jurisprudence
to
construing
the--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--right.
smith
held
the
foreign
country
exception
applied
even
though
the
employee
would...
the...
the
plaintiff
would
have
no
remedy.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
i
don't
think
it's
inconsistent.
i
think
one
thing
that's
important
is
that
the
court...
both
in
that
case
and
in
meyer
and
in
gutierrez
de
martinez,
the
court
looked
at
provisions
of
the
ftca
that
are
not
models
of
clarity
and
attempted
to
give
a
sensible
reading,
given
the...
the
purposes
that
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
and
the
context
and
structure
of
the
specific
provisions.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
agree
entirely.
as
the
court
said
in
meyer,
the
jurisdiction
under
the
ftca
is
defined
by
the
scope
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
without
question--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--no,
the
statute
doesn't
say
what
it
means
by
judgment.
and
i...
and
i
don't
think
judgment
has
a
clear
meaning,
and
that's
why
it's
appropriate
to
look
to
the
context
of
the
provision,
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
in
the
provision
to
interpret
the
scope
of
the
bar
and
the
meaning
of...
of
that
word
and
all
the
words
together.
the...
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
shift
suits
from
the
employees
to
the
government,
and
the
background
of
this
specific
provision,
little
as
it
is,
and
the
comparison
in
a
couple
places
to
this
provision
discussing
a
parallel
way
to
the
administrative
settlement
provision...
we
think
the
most
sensible
reading
is
that
congress
was
trying
to
extend
the
preclusion
effect
of
the
suit
against
the
government
so
that
although
the
employee
would
no
longer
be
sued
and
would
get
that
benefit
in
the
first
instance,
if
the
plaintiff
chose
to
go
against
the
government
first,
the
employee
wouldn't
have...
there
would
be
no
second
suit
against
the
employee
for
those
same
state
law
torts
because
in...
in
1946,
the
only
torts
congress
was
considering
were
state
law
torts.
am
i
going
to
sue
the
government
for
negligence
or
my
mail
carrier
for
negligence?
and
to...
both
for
efficiency
reasons,
to
protect
the
government,
which
was
concerned
about...
about
the
burden
on
it
of
having
to
go...
to
litigate
twice,
the
preclusion
effect
would
be
carried
to
the
employee,
so
that
once
there
was
a
resolution
of
the
state
law
torts
against
the
government,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
i
think
the
end
of
the
matter
is
actually
a
phrase
that
the
assistant
attorney
general
uses
in
the
legislative
history.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
in...
in
many
cases,
if
not
most
cases,
an...
a
plaintiff
won't
have
both
remedies
available.
so
it's
only
a...
a
small
universe
of
cases
anyway
in
which
a
plaintiff
would
want
to
sue
in
bivens
and
sue
under
the
ftca.
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
before
discovery,
when
all
you've
done
is
file
your
administrative
claim
to
which,
in
many
cases
as
in
this
one,
the
government
has
never
even
responded,
the
plaintiffs
and
the
lawyers
may
have
no
idea
that
they
actually
have
a
bivens
claim.
in
this
case,
when
they
thought
they
had
one,
they
filed
it.
also,
the
government's
view
in...
in
other
cases
is
not
that
your...
it
doesn't
help
the
plaintiffs
to
sue
simultaneously
because
the
government's
position
in
other
cases
has
been...
and
courts
have
largely
agreed...
that
once
the
judgment
in
the...
on
the
ftca
claim
comes
down,
the
bivens
suit
is
then
precluded,
in
some
cases
even
if
the
judgment
in
the
bivens
suit
has
preceded
the
judgment
in
the
ftca
suit.
so
bringing
them
simultaneously,
while
in
some
cases
might...
might
be
feasible
and
seem
like
a
good
idea,
is
not
necessarily
going
to
protect
the
plaintiffs,
given
the
scope
of
the
government's
arguments.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
bring
the
individual...
bring
suit...
the
bivens
suit
first?
if
the...
if
the
statute
of
limitations
work
out,
you
could
bring
the
bivens
suit
first,
but
again,
you'd
have
to--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--yes.
and
since,
either
way,
you're
only
going
to
get
one
satisfaction
for
your
claim,
it
seems
odd
to
adopt
a
construction
that
encourages
plaintiffs
to
go
first
after
the
employees
when
the
purpose
of
the
ftca
was
try
to
encourage
plaintiffs
to
go
after
the
government
instead.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes.
and...
and
if
the
government
had
responded
in
this
case
to
the
administrative
claim
in...
in
a
timely
manner
or
at
all,
the
plaintiffs
would
have
had
a
better
sense
of
where
they
stood
on
the
ftca
claim
before
they
filed
suit.
i'd
like
to
mention,
although
the
government
has
sort
of
retracted
it,
that
footnote
5
of
their
reply
brief
concedes
that
claims
wholly
outside
the
purview
of
the
ftca,
to
use
their
phrase...
that
judgments
based
on
claims
wholly
outside
the
purview
of
the
ftca
do
not
trigger
the
judgment
bar.
claims
based
on...
claims
that
arise
under
the
exceptions
of
2680
are
surely
outside
the
purview
of
the
fta...
ftca.
the...
the
1945
committee
report,
which
is
the
last
one
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
actually
describes
the
ftca
2680
exceptions
as
excepting
certain
classes
of
torts
from
the
grant
of
the
right
to
sue.
not
only
does
that
make
clear
that
they're
outside
the
purview
of
the
ftca,
but
that
they
are
matters
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
as
this
court
has
explained
in
cases
like
scarborough
and
last
month
in
everhart,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
refers
to
classes
of
cases
that
the
court
has
authority
to
adjudicate.
the
court...
the
district
court
did
not
have
authority
to
adjudicate
the
ftca
claim
filed
by
the
hallocks
because
it
fell
within
an
exception.
for
that
reason,
res
judicata
would
not
apply.
thank
you.
