justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
it's
true,
is
it...
i'm
testing
my
own
understanding
of
this...
that
if,
in
fact,
shall
not
apply
meant
anything
in
that
chapter,
if
you
had
a
state
and
that
state
gave
a
state
law
remedy
for,
say,
detaining
property
or
for
loss
of
mail
or
something,
then
that
state
law
remedy
would
continue
in
existence
because
the
thing
in
the
law
that
sets
aside
that
state
court
remedy
is
a
different
part
of
the
same
chapter--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--namely
2679(b)?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
whole
point
of
the
westfall
act
is
to
get
rid
of
those
state
causes
of
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
language
does
seem
to
say
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
then...
then
to
get
to
the
main
point
here,
if
we
are
going
to
get
to
that,
the
question
that
i
would
have
for
you
is...
is
the
following.
if
we
accept
your
interpretation,
it's
pretty
anomalous.
i
mean,
someone
who
brings
his
bivens
action
first,
of
course,
can
sue
the
individual
employee,
and
you
agree
to
that.
but
if
he
brings
his
bivens
action
second,
because
he
made
a
mistake
and
went
into
the
wrong
court
or
he
brought
the
wrong
action
or
it
was
a
borderline
case,
frankly,
and
he
didn't
know
how
it
would
end
up,
that
person
is
out
of
luck.
now,
there's
nothing
in
this
statute
that
says
that
the
government...
that
the
congress
wanted
to
achieve
that
result.
what
order
you
bring
the
suit
in
shouldn't
really
make
any
difference
here.
the
bivens
action
is
totally
different
from
all
the
other
tort
actions
in
that
respect,
and
it's
listed
separately
in
2679
to
make
clear
that
it
isn't...
it
is
different.
so
why?
i
mean,
why
read
it
your
way?
the
burden
that
reading
it
their
way
would
impose
on
the
government
is
minuscule.
the
number
of
such
suits
is
tiny,
i
would
imagine.
now,
what
is
wrong
with
my
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
lot
of
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
left
out
one
word
that
i
think
is
important
there.
to
test
it
to
see
if
i'm
right
about
this
is
i
thought
2679(b)
was
focusing
in
large
part
upon
state
tort
suits.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
state
tort
suits--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
part.
am
i
right
about
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
therefore,
if
in
fact
we
had
words
mean
what
they
seem
to
mean,
congress
would
have
both
removed
the
state
lawsuits
in
2679(b)
and
reinstated
them
or
set
them
in
the
exceptions.
but
that
would
have
the
statute
defeat
itself,
and
therefore,
that
case
that
you're
citing
came
to
a
correct
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
don't
tell
me
it's
right
if
it's
not
right
is
all
i
want--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that...
that...
see,
that's
what's...
i'm
not
at
all
certain
about
this,
whether
they
have
an
appeal,
whether
they
don't
have
an
appeal.
i'm
testing
it
out.
but
it
seems
to
me
if
we
take
your
position,
we're
going
to
make
things
awfully
complicated.
that
is,
the...
the
basic
idea
here
is
in
the
vast
mine
run
of
employee
suits,
go
sue
the
government,
and
you
can't
sue
the
employee
at
all.
that's
true
of
the
state
actions.
that's
true
of
ordinary
tort
actions.
and
so
ordinarily,
if
you
sued
the...
the
employee,
whether
you
sued
him
first,
second,
or
third,
you're
not
supposed
to
and
he
ought
to
have
an
appeal
right
away
to
get
you
out
of
court.
now,
there
is
an
exception
there
with
the
bivens
because
you
can
bring
your
suit
first
and
then
there's
no
problem.
but
if
we
make
an
exception
in
the
appealability
rule
for
that,
people
are
going
to
get
mixed
up.
it's
a
kind
of
curlicue,
and
even
in
the
bivens
case,
it
has
a
basic
objective
of
trying
to
prevent
people
from
harassing
the
employee
because
the
instances
in
which
you
bring
a
bivens
suit
first,
as
a
practical
matter,
are
probably
small.
now,
what's
the
response
to
that?
i'm
just
nervous
about
making
these
collateral
rules
so
complicated
as
to
whether...
you'd
have
to
do
it
whether
it's
a
bivens
suit
or
some
other
kind
of
suit
under
this,
and
nobody
is
going
to
understand
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
put
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--put
in
the
whole
bag.
say
give
the
employee
his
appeal
because
most
of
the
time
it's
totally
to
help
him
from
being
harassed.
now,
what's
the
answer
to
that?
and
i'm
not...
i'm
putting
it
because
i
want
to
get
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
rule
would
be
this.
it's
such
a
complicated
area.
i'm
sorry.
but
if
a
plaintiff
brings
a
lawsuit,
tort
suit,
against
a
government
employee
and
the
westfall
act
bars
the
lawsuit,
period,
you
can't
sue
him
at
all
because
of...
of
(b).
he
gets
an
immediate
appeal
if
the
district
court
doesn't
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
under
the
westfall
act
you
could
sue
him,
depending
on
the
order,
he
doesn't
get
an
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't...
i
don't
understand.
if
we
were
to
take
that,
wouldn't
we
have
to
overturn
smith?
you
think
not.
you
just
said
not.
but
as
i...
then
as
i
understand
smith,
we
look
to
(b)
and
(b)
says,
plaintiff,
you
cannot
bring
an
action
under
anything.
okay?
you
can't
bring
a
state
tort
law
action.
you
can't
bring
an
action
under
federal
law
against
the
employee,
with
certain
exceptions
where
you
can
like
bivens
and
where
there's
a
specific
statute.
then
we
have
over
here
the
exceptions
section.
and
over
here
in
the
exceptions
section,
it
says
there
is
no
federal
action
for,
among
other
things,
the
case
in
front
of
us
and,
among
other
things,
actions
in
a
foreign
country.
and
so
the
court
says,
one,
this
is
in
a
foreign
country,
so
you
can't
bring
it
under
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
now
we'll
go
look
to
see
whether
this
bar
that
you
can't
bring
it,
period,
applies.
they
say
it
does
apply.
now,
justice
stevens
dissented,
but
he
didn't
dissent
on
that
ground.
and...
and
so...
so
i
don't
see
how
we
could
reach
the
result
with
this
other
exception
without
overturning
smith
because
smith
said
(b)
does
apply.
and
so
if
the
fact
that
it
falls
within
an
exception
means
the
whole
thing
doesn't
apply,
then
they
would
have
held
(b)
doesn't
apply.
but
they
said
(b)
does
apply.
so
how
do
we
get
there
given
smith?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that...
that
would
be
to
overturn
the
reasoning
of
smith.
it
would
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
effect,
they
didn't...
the
court
didn't
consider
this
argument
in
smith.
