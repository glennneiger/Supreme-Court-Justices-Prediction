so
do
i.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
certainly
broader...
it's
certainly
broader
than
res
judicata
anyway,
isn't
it?
because
if
the
government...
suit
against
the
government
is
dismissed
on
jurisdictional
grounds,
what
would
be
res
judicata
is
only
the
jurisdictional
question,
and...
and
this
doesn't...
this
goes
beyond
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
go...
go
through
that
again,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
thing
you
haven't
answered
that
i
think
is
troubling
everybody
is
why
is...
why
is
that...
i
mean,
if
you
could
come
up
with
some
explanation
of
why
that
concern
for
morale
only
arises
after
there
has
been
a...
a
judgment
in
the
suit
against
the
government.
why...
if
that
were
the
concern
and
if
the
government
wanted
total
immunity,
why
wouldn't
they
have
extended
it
to
a...
a
1983
suit
brought
before
the
ftca
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
a
good
reason
for
that.
