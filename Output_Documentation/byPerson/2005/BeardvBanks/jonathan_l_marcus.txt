mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
pennsylvania's
policy
of
prohibiting
its
most
dangerous
and
recalcitrant
prisoners
from
possessing
newspapers,
magazines,
and
photos
as
an
incentive
to
improve
their
behavior
does
not
violate
their
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this...
i
mean,
this
court
has
already
said
that
with
respect
to
eighth
amendment
rights,
the
turner
analysis
does
not
apply.
so
with
respect
to
basic...
basic
necessities,
health
care,
food,
and
water,
the...
the
turner
analysis
doesn't
apply,
and
so
you
could
not
sort
of
create
an
incentive
program
to
take
away
eighth
amendment
rights.
and
under...
with
respect
to
the
rights
that
can
be...
that
can
be
limited
in
order
to
serve
legitimate
penological
interests,
we
think
that...
that
the
turner
approach
would
give
a
lot
of
deference
to
and
a
lot
of
flexibility
to
states
to...
to
use
incentive
programs--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
i...
i
think...
i
mean,
i
think
there
is...
i
don't
think
it's
a
boundless
theory.
i
think
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
program
in
pennsylvania
was...
it's
implemented
as
a
last
resort.
i
mean,
the
prisoners
that
this
regulation
applies
to
are
a
narrow
class
of
40
prisoners
who
have
been
the
most
violent
and
most
disruptive--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--but--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--i...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter.
i
think
there's
still
room
under
the
turner
analysis
to
apply
the
exaggerated
response
test,
and
that's
one
of
the
things
the
turner
analysis
does
when
you
go
through
the
four
factors,
as...
as
the
government
did
and
the
state
has
done
in
its
brief,
that
there
could
be
a
situation
where
you
would
find
that
there's
been
an
exaggerated
response
and
that
their
withdrawal
of
the
first
amendment
right
is
actually
an
exaggerated
response.
for
example,
maybe
if...
if
there
was
just
one
minor
disciplinary
violation
for,
let's
say,
using
obscene
language,
and
then
every...
all
first
amendment
rights
to
communication
were...
were
pulled
out
at
that
point
for
the
remainder
of
the
time--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--there
is
a
reasonableness
limit,
and
we've...
we've--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--no.
this
court--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--that's
right.
no.
i
mean...
no.
this
court
has
drawn...
has
drawn
that
distinction.
the
distinction
this
court
has
drawn
is
that...
that
most
rights
can
be
limited
or
even
totally
prohibited
within
prison,
consistent
with...
with
legitimate
penological
objectives,
deterrence
and
rehabilitation.
the
exceptions
this
court
has
identified
are
for
the
eighth
amendment
and
also
for
access...
you
know,
access
to
the
courts,
that
you
could...
that...
because
that
also
implicates
the
integrity
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
i
think
it
would
be...
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it
would
be
a
rare
case
where
an
incentive
program
like
this
could
be
struck
down
as
a...
you
know,
as
a
facial
matter,
as...
as
this
challenge
is.
i
think
it
would
be
a
rare
case.
but
i
think
you
do...
you
do
still
go
through
all
the...
all
four
factors,
and
you
would
look
at
the
fourth
factor
and
see
that,
in
fact,
pennsylvania
does
give
prisoners
the
opportunity
to
regain
those
privileges
if
they
behave
well.
as
the
state
pointed
out,
at
the
time
the
record
was
made
in
this
case--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
we
do
think
that...
that
the
state
can
go...
can
go
quite
far
with
respect
to
restricting
first
amendment
rights,
but
this
court
still...
i
mean,
under
prong
two,
this
court
does
look
to
alternative
means
to
exercise
the
right.
and
here,
99.9
percent
of
the
prisoners
in
pennsylvania,
do
get
to
possess
newspapers,
magazines,
and
photos.
the
ltsu
prisoners
who
graduate
get
to,
and
on
top
of
that,
while
they're
in
the
ltsu,
the
prisoners
get
to
possess
two
books.
they--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--oh,
not
at
all.
there
are
many...
there
are
many
intermediate
stages.
there
are
restricted
housing
units
and
then
there
are
smu's
and...
and
special
management
units,
and...
and--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--there
are
incentive
programs
within
each
of
those
restricted
units,
and...
and
the
prisoners
that
end
up
at
the
ltsu...
the
vast
majority
of
them
have
already
been
through
the
smu
program
and
haven't
made
it
and
have
failed
that
program.
so
they've
tried
numerous
other
incentives
before
getting
to
this
point.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
right,
and
that
depends
on
their
behavior.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--justice
stevens,
they
get
a
review
after
90
days
and
then
every
30
days
thereafter.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
those
reviews
are
an
empty
gesture.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
the...
the
review
correlates
with
their
behavior,
and
to
the
extent
they
show
a
positive
adjustment
in
their
behavior,
their...
they
graduate
from
level
2
to
level
1
where
they
do
have
access
to
newspapers
and
magazines
and
then
they
can
graduate
all
the
way
out.
and
my
understanding
is
a
number
of
prisoners
have
done
that
within
1
year.
and
with
respect
to
someone
who
never
gets
out,
that
person
might
have
an
as
applied
challenge
if
that
person
could
show
that
his
behavior--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--while
they're
in
the
ltsu?
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
no,
i
don't
think
any
such
study
is
done.
but
again,
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
to
require
the
state
to
offer
evidence.
i
mean,
this
court
has
emphasized
in
turner
that
the
connection
between
the
regulation
and
the
goals
need
merely
be
logical.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
to
defend
under
the
second--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--under
the
second
prong
of
turner
because
under
the
second
prong
of
turner,
you
look
to
alternative
means.
we
might
still
come
in
here
and
defend
that
program,
but
here
they
do
provide
alternative
means
to
read
and
to
see
loved
ones
through
visitation
and
through
correspondence
and
to
have
two...
they
have
two
books
in
their
cell
so
they
can
continue
reading.
so
there...
that...
that
does
factor
into
the
balance,
and
we
think
it...
it's
very
clear
that
pennsylvania's
program
is
reasonable,
and
it
would
just
be
a
more
difficult
case
if
they
totally
prohibited--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--no,
that's...
that's
not
our
position.
we
think
there
is
a
balancing
under
turner,
and
you
do...
you
do
look
at
all
four
factors
of
the
test.
and
we
think
that
pennsylvania's
just
clearly
satisfies
that
test.
and
if
you
applied
this
across
the
board
to
the
general
population,
it
wouldn't.
it
wouldn't
pass
the
test.
but...
but
these
are
the...
these
are
the
worst
of
the
worst
and
they've
gone
through
many
other...
pennsylvania
has
gone
through
countless
other
measures
to
try
to
improve
these
inmates'
behavior,
and
so
i
think
it's
wrong
to
conclude,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
that
this
was
an
exaggerated
response.
thank
you.
