justice
david
h.
souter
now,
on...
on
your
theory
of...
of
behavior
modification,
would
it,
nonetheless,
be...
be
open
to
the
state
to
say,
no,
you
may
not
receive
any
more
legal
materials
and
you
may
not
go
to
the
library
to
look
at
them?
because
that's
something
you
very
much
want
to
do.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
you've
got
to
shape
up
and...
and
get
moved
down
to
a
lesser
level
of
security.
would
that...
i'm
not
saying
that
the
state
is...
is
about
to
do
that,
but
on
your
theory,
could
the
state
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
would...
i
mean,
you
know,
one
of
the
arguments
made
on
the
other
side
is
that
if
you
accept
the
behavior
modification
theory
as
an
adequate
justification,
the
turner
categories
essentially
become
incoherent.
what,
for
example,
would
be
the
alternative
means
in
this
case
if
the
state
said,
we
realize
that
the
people
in...
in...
at
level
2
want
to
see
legal
materials
very,
very
much
because
that
is
a
source
of
hope
for
them,
and
we
want
them
to
have
that
source
of
hope
only
if
they
shape
up
and...
and
get
down
to
a
reduced
level
of
security,
so
we're
going
to
stop
it,
period?
what
would
be
the
alternatives
within
the...
the
turner
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the...
what
if
the
inmate
said,
look,
the...
the
lawyers
who
come
to
see
us
are...
are
great
guys,
but
they're...
they're
overworked.
they
don't
have
time
to
be
thinking
about
novel
legal
theories,
which
we
would
dream
up
perhaps
if
we
could
get
to
legal
times
and
these
periodicals?
so
it's...
it's
not
an
alternative.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're...
you're
saying
there...
there's
a
separate
value
here,
and
that
is
the
value
of
access
to
courts.
and...
and
that
limits
what
can
be
done
for
purposes
of
behavior
modification.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what
about
the
marriage
example?
the...
the
court
has
said,
yes,
you
couldn't...
the...
the
state
can't
prevent
the
inmate
from...
from
getting
married.
i
don't
see
where
the
separate
source
of...
of
value
is
that
would...
that...
that
would
affect
that
analysis.
no
right
of
access
to
court.
the
associational
rights
can
be
abridged
and
so
on.
why,
on
your
analysis,
wouldn't...
wouldn't
the
proper
disposition
of
the
earlier
case
have
been
to
say,
yes,
the
state
can
preclude
marriage
too
because
that's
something
they
very
much
want
and...
and
the
state
can
preclude
that
unless
they
shape
up
and...
and
get
down
to
a...
a
lesser
level
of
security?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
there
just
is
not
a
logical
connection
there
within--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
meaning
of
the...
of
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
would
be
a
logical
connection
for
those
who
want
to
get
married.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're...
you're
saying
it
might
not
makes
sense
as
a
systemic
policy--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
it
isn't
a
big
enough
problem.
but
for...
we're
not
talking
about
a
whole
system
here.
we're
talking
about
40
people
or
less,
and
if
some
of
those
40
people
want
to
get
married,
why
doesn't
it
make
perfect
sense
to
say
no
marriage?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can,
and
on...
on
your
analysis,
why
isn't
that
sufficient?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
how
do
we
get
around
the
marriage
case
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
as
to
these,
the...
the
marriage
could
be
banned,
in
effect,
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't
we...
don't
we
have
the
same
problem
if
we're...
if
we're
dealing
with
first
amendment
interests
that
we
do
when
we're
dealing
with
eighth
amendment
interests?
in
other
words,
if...
if
we
don't
say,
well,
they
get
outside
of
turner
analysis
because
they
require...
by
virtue
of
being
enumerated
rights,
they
require
an
analysis
specific
to
them,
is
the
abridgement
of
the
right
carried
so
far
that
it
is
unreasonable?
if
we
don't
say
that,
then
i
don't
see,
as
your
friends
on
the
other
side
have
argued,
i
don't
see
where
the
logical
stopping
point
is
if
we
accept
the...
the
behavior
modification
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
oh,
i...
i
realize
that.
i
mean,
they're...
they're
making
an
in
extremis
kind
of
argument.
i
understand
that.
but
if...
if
we
accept
an
in
extremis
kind
of
argument
on
the
theory
of
behavior
modification,
then
i
don't
see
why
that
argument
does
not,
for
example,
cover
the
marriage
case,
and
maybe...
maybe
it
should.
i
don't
know
why
that
argument
would
not
allow
for
a
total
deprivation
of
all
communication
outside
of,
let's
say,
access
to
counsel.
and...
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
we
admit
it
or
not,
what's
going
on
here,
whether
we
call
it
turner
analysis
or
not,
is
we're
making
some
kind
of
a
judgment
as
to
whether
they're
carrying
the
deprivation
for
behavior
modification
purposes
in
these
extreme
cases
too
far.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
that's
what...
i'll...
i'll
be
quiet
in
a
second.
[laughter]
if
that's...
if
that's
what
we're
doing,
aren't
we
just
as
much
outside
the
turner
analysis
when
we're
talking
about
the
first
amendment
or
associational
rights
under
the
first
amendment
as
we
are
when
we're
talking
about
the
eighth
amendment?
and
shouldn't
we
say
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
but
at
some
point,
there's
sort
of
a
reasonableness
limit
then
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
consistent--
justice
david
h.
souter
--consistently
with
your
answer,
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
to
say
they
should
give
the
tv
back,
they
should
give
the
magazines
back
because
none
of
those
worked
either.
and
those
are
first
amendment
deprivations
to
some
degree.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
i
mean,
what's...
what's
your
answer
to
my
question?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
point
to
the
chief
justice
was
the
courts
have
to
review
the
efficacy
of
these
moves.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if...
if
there
is
no
efficacy
and
there
is
an
infringement
of
what,
at
least
for
people
on
the
outside,
would
be
a
protected
right,
then
they
have
no
justification
for
taking
those
rights
away.
and
if
that's
going
to
be
the
analysis,
then
on...
on
the
argument
you
just
gave,
they've
got
to
give
the
tv
rights
back,
they've
got
to
give
the
magazine
rights
back,
and
so
on.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
sure
would
like
that,
but--
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
then
why?
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
and
in...
in
your
argument,
in
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
you
were
pointing
out
a
situation
in
which
taking
away
the
tv
didn't
work,
taking
away
the
magazines
didn't
work.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
then
do
they
not,
on
your
theory,
have
to
give
tv
and
magazines
back?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
where
does
your
efficacy
criterion
go?
you're
saying
they
may
make
judgments,
and
apparently
they
may...
may
make
judgments
and
maintain
them
even
if
those
judgments
do
not,
in
fact,
advance
their
interests.
here,
you're
saying
they...
it's
not
going
to
advance
their
interests,
so
they
can't
do
it.
in
these
cases,
you're
saying
they
don't
advance
their
interests,
but
they
can
as
a
matter
of
judgment.
and
i
don't
know
how
to
draw
that
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
may
i
interrupt
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--with
this
question?
aren't
you
really
saying
that
when
the
deprivations
get
beyond
some
point,
some
serious
point,
the
issue
is
not
properly
analyzed
under
turner
and
safley,
can
they
do
one
thing
more?
the
issue
really
becomes
one
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
is
the
totality
that
they
have
taken
away
so
great
that
it
is
cruel
to
maintain
these
people
under
these
circumstances?
is
that
the
argument
you're
really
making?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
know
that
wasn't...
that
wasn't
the
claim
that
you
made,
but
isn't
that
the
argument
that
you're
making?
