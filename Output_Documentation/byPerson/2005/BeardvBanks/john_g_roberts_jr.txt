john
g.
roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
beard
v.
banks.
mr.
rovelli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
a
paperback
version
of
war
and
peace
is
less
dangerous?
it
seems
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
why
i
thought
your
answer
would
have
focused
on
that
rather
than
the
security
concerns,
is
that
you
take
away
what
it
is
they
want
the
most
because
that's
most
likely
to
result
in
them
conforming
their
behavior
so
they
can
get
it
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
rovelli.
mr.
marcus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
i
take
it
somewhere...
you
couldn't
deprive
them
of
food,
if
that
would
get
them
to...
to
conform.
justice
souter
was
asking
about
marriage.
i
mean,
how
do
we
tell
when...
when
you
can
deprive
someone
of
something
they...
to
modify
their
behavior
and
when
it
goes
too
far?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
marcus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
krakoff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
krakoff,
what...
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
have
any
objection
to
terminating
of
television
rights,
for
example.
if
prisoners
have
the
right
to
watch
television,
they
misbehave,
the
penalty
is
no
television.
is
that
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
other
alternatives
would
you
have
the
prison
administrators
rely
on?
you
have
an
incorrigible
prisoner
who's
misbehaving.
he
won't
behave.
they
go
through
every...
he
gets
up
to
level...
level
2.
what...
what
should
they
have
done
instead?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
what
should
they
have
done
instead?
let's
say
he
gets
out
of
the
prison
1
hour
every
other
day.
should
they
have
taken
that
hour
out?
i
mean,
not
out
of
the
prison.
out
of
his
cell.
should
they
have
taken
that
hour
away,
or
what...
what
other
options
do
they
have?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
would
like
you
to
tell
me
what
else
they
should
have
done.
why
is
that
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
none
of
that
worked.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
there's
nothing
else
they
could
have
done,
but
they
shouldn't
have
done
this
because
this
wasn't
going
to
work
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
now
you're
giving...
now
you're
making
their
situation
worse
because
they
tried
to
make
your
client's
situation
better.
i
mean,
yes,
they
could...
maybe
they
could
prohibit
religious
journals
as
well,
but
they...
for
various
reasons,
they
decided
not
to
do
that.
maybe
they
could
have
eliminated
legal
materials
as
well,
but
again,
they
decided
not
to
do
it.
they
take
a
more
circumscribed
approach.
so
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
very
effective
response
to
say,
well,
they
let
religious
materials
in
and
that
can
be
used
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
visitors...
if
there's
a
security
issue
with
visitors
to
the
prisoner,
you're
saying
you
can't
prohibit
visitors
because
if
you
allow
the
lawyers
to
come
in,
because
they're
visitors
too?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
wouldn't
undermine
the
security
rationale
just
because
you
have
some
exceptions
where
there
are
other
countervailing
interests
that
might
outweigh
the
security
concern.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
once
you're
in
that
situation
already,
as
these
prisoners
are,
and
they're
still
not
conforming
their
behavior
to
the
prison
rules,
you
have
a
limited
number
of
options
for
trying
to
get
them
to
do
that,
and
your
response
to
my
first
line
of
questioning
was
that
there's
nothing
else
you
can
think
of
that
they
could
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
response
is
they
should
just
grin
and
bear
it.
they--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
rovelli,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
in
04-1730,
beard
versus
banks.
