mr.
rovelli,
i...
i
forget.
how
big
a
class
of...
of
prisoners
are
we
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
less
than
40?
and
does
the
record
tell
us
how
long
they
have
been
in
level
2?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
any
average
or
any...
is
there...
does
the
record
tell
us
how...
how
long
most
of
them
have
been
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
75
percent
had
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
long...
do
we
know
what
the
average
period
of
incarceration
in
level
2
is?
is
it
a
matter
of
weeks,
or
is
it
a
matter
of
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
trying
to
understand
whether
typically
they're
there
for
a
long
period
of
time
on
the
one
hand,
or
are
they
there
sort
of
on
probation
and
are
periodically
reviewed
and
moved
into
another
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
marcus,
i
was
kind
of
interested
in
your
calling
this
an
incentive
program.
is
there
any...
there
are
no
intermediate
stages.
it's
an
all
or
nothing
incentive,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
mean,
with
respect
to
the
prisoners
in
this
population.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
didn't
understand
that
the...
the
prisoners
in
this
particular
part
of
the
prison
had
any
intermediate
incentive.
they
either
get
out
after
a
year
or
2
or
they
don't.
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
they
either
get
to
a
different
classification.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
scoring.
you've
got
25
points
now,
so
you're
pretty
close
to
your
goal
or
anything
like...
it's
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
like
most
incentive
programs
i've
heard
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
does
the
review
correlate
it
in
any
way
with
these
particular
deprivations?
i
mean,
what
is
the
review...
how
does
the
review
correlate
with
their
inability
to
get
reading
materials?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
evidence
at
all
that
the
amount
of
reading
that
they
do
has
any
correlation
to
their
opportunity
for
getting
better
assignments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
that
there's
any
correlation
whatsoever
between
how
much
these
people...
these
prisoners
read
and
when
they
get
into
the
next
level
of
the
prison.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
legal
issues
would
be
precisely
the
same
if
the
state
denied
totally
any
reading
material
to
the
prisoners.
we
have
the
same
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
be
more
difficult?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understood
your
argument
to,
in
effect,
contend
that
the
behavior
modification
rationale
will
justify
the
program
no
matter
what
the
balancing
process
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
that
the
prison
grapevine
really
doesn't
tell
the
prisoners
about
this
particular
lack
of
access
to
public
materials.
does
the
prison
grapevine
let
them
know
that
they're
going
to
be
in
the
cell
for
23
hours
a
day
and
only
be
out
1
hour
a
day?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
is
generally
known,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
itself
would
be
sufficient
incentive
to
try
and
avoid
this
program,
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
be
able
to
read
the
christian
science
monitor
or
the
new
york
times.
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
the...
what
we're
fighting
about
is
trivial
compared
to
the
very
obvious
deterrent
value
of
23
hours
in
the
same
cell
7
days
a
week,
30
days
a
month,
365
days
a
year.
i
don't
think
i'd
care
about
this
other
stuff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
let
me
just
ask
one...
one
thing
i
am
curious
about.
the
argument...
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
kind
of
a
flow
of
these.
some
of
them
get
out
of
this
system
and
some
stay
a
long
time.
what
does
the
record
tell
us
about
how
often,
if
they
conform
to
the
regular
rules
without
any
violation
for
40
days
or
a
year,
do
they...
do
they
get
out
of
this...
this
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
posing
what
the
rules
say.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether...
you
know,
whether
the
system
is
just
something
we're
talking
about
or
whether
it
really
has
an
effect
on
people's
moving
from
this
classification
to
another
classification.
