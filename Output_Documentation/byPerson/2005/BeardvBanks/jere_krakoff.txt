mr.
jere
krakoff
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
several
of
the
points
that
were
made
by
my
colleague.
first,
i
find
it
interesting
that
and
also
of
some
relevance
in
this
case
that
the
decision
to
deny
access
to
secular
newspapers
and
magazines
that
this
policy
of
withdrawing
access
to
these
materials
is
not
a
policy
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
with
respect
to
its
most
maximum
security
inmates,
those
who
are
housed
in
the
control
units.
i
also
think
it's
important
to
note
that
while
there's
a
90-day
minimum
period
that
these
inmates
have
to
remain
in
the
long
term
segregation
unit
on
level
2
status
where
this...
when
this
policy
applies,
the
policy
also
says
that
as
long
as
an
inmate
is
serving
a
disciplinary
sentence
within
the
prison,
that
he's
not
eligible
for
promotion
to
level
1.
and
the
testimony
from
the
department's
designated
witness,
deputy...
superintendent
dickson,
acknowledged
that
most
of
the
inmates
in
the
unit
are,
indeed,
serving
disciplinary
time.
mr.
jere
krakoff
i
was...
i
was
simply
trying
to
point
out...
the...
the
court
had
asked
how
long
are
inmates
generally
in
the
long
term
segregation
unit,
and...
and
the
point
that
i
made
is
that
it's
not
unusual
for
inmates
to
remain
on
level
2
for
periods
in
excess
of
1
year.
mr.
jere
krakoff
that
is
correct.
our
position
is
that
the
choice
of
what
vehicle
the
institution
wants
to
permit
through
which
inmates
can
gain
access
to
what
is
occurring
outside
of
the
prison
walls
in
political
and
other
public
matters,
that's
the
institution's
choice.
and
the
reason
these
inmates
sued
for
access
to
newspapers
and
magazines
is
because
the
representative
plaintiff,
mr.
banks,
was
allowed
to
receive
his
christian
science
monitor
magazine
because
it
was
religious
in
nature,
but
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
receive
his
christian
science
monitor
newspaper
under...
under
this
policy.
there's
another
very
important--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--okay.
bottom
line
under
my
reading
of
turner
and
safley
is
that
there
has
to
be
first
that
logical
connection
under
the
first
prong.
that's
not
a...
an
imperative--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--well,
what
their...
their
argument
is
essentially
that
this
policy
was
basically
a
decision
by
default,
not
a
decision
that
was
reasoned
by
prison
administrators.
they...
they
essentially
said
virtually
everything
has
been
taken
away
from
these
prisoners.
mr.
jere
krakoff
and
we
have
nothing
left
to
take
away.
mr.
jere
krakoff
it's
wrong
because
there
is
no
logical
connection
to
taking
something
away
under
the
facts
of
this
case
when
taking
away
an
entire
litany
of...
or
a
very
broad
spectrum
of
things
which...
in
the
special
management
units,
where
these
inmates
came
from,
they
had
had
magazines
taken
away
on
their
first
phase
in
the
special
management
units.
they
had
been
offered
the
incentive
of
earning
access
to
magazines,
of
earning
access
to
weekly
visits
with
family
members,
of
earning
access
to
telephone
calls,
in
fact,
of
earning
access
for
release
from
their
cells
the
23
hours
a
day
to
engage
in...
in
small
group
activities
with
other
inmates.
and
most
spectacular
was
they
had
the
opportunity,
while
in
the
special
management
unit,
to
earn
a
3
to
6-month
probationary
period
in
a
general
population
cell
block.
mr.
jere
krakoff
absolutely.
and
my
point
is
if...
if
that
didn't
work,
including
magazines,
which
is
the
equivalent
of...
essentially
of...
of
newspapers,
they
had
no
logical
or--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--my
answer
is
that
you
can't
deprive
an
inmate
of
his
constitutional
right
of
free
speech--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--unless
there's
reason
to
do
so.
mr.
jere
krakoff
what
they've
done
here
is
they've
removed
all
of
the
vehicles
to--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--that's
right.
mr.
jere
krakoff
may
i
answer
it
this
way?
i
know
i'm
supposed
to
say
yes
or
no
and
then--
[laughter]
--to
give
an
explanation.
mr.
jere
krakoff
i'll
say
no.
my
instinct
is
no,
and
i
would
also
say
the--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--i've
been
reading
turner
v.
safley
and
then
more
recently
overton
because
this
is
basic
in
my
practice
to
represent
prisoners.
and
my
reading
of
overton
is
that
you
can't
have
a
policy.
the
prison
officials
cannot
have
a
policy
unless
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
policy
is
going
to
advance
a
legitimate
penological
interest.
mr.
jere
krakoff
i
think--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--i...
i
think
that
an
institution
can
always
make
judgments
about
how
extensive
they
want
to
allow
inmates
to--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--no.
i'm...
i'm
not
saying
they
can't
as
a
matter
of
judgment.
i...
i'm
suggesting
that
they
can
select
among
options...
we're
specifically
speaking
about
access
to
information
outside
the
prison
walls.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
they
can't
eliminate
every
suitable
way
by
which
inmates
can
gain.
and
i
think
the
word
is
of
sufficient
utility...
was
the...
was
the
language
that
was
used
in
overton.
and
i'm
saying
the
bottom
line
is
they
can't
eliminate
all
means
by
which
inmates
can
access
information.
mr.
jere
krakoff
i've
had
other--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--obviously,
this...
this
did
matter
enough
to
the
prisoners
to
commence
a
lawsuit.
i
don't
think
that
the
standard
by
which
a
court...
this
court
or
any
other
federal
court
should
determine
whether
or
not
there's
a
logical
connection
or
a
reasonable
connection
is
whether
or
not
inmates
choose
to
file
suit.
that's
establishing
a
litmus
test--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--but
i
see
a
distinction.
there
are
lots
of
things
that
matters
to
prisoners
and
lots
of
things
that
matter
to
us
in
the
free
world
that
aren't
going
to
change
our
behavior.
there...
there
are
some
things
that
are
important
to
us--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--they
made
the
argument
that
this
is
part
of
an
overarching
deterrent
program.
mr.
jere
krakoff
well,
but
if
you
look...
justice
scalia,
if...
if
one
looks
at
the
record
carefully,
you
see
that
this
policy
which,
by
the
way,
applies
to
40
inmates
in
one
particular
institution
in
a...
in
a
prison
system
that
has
23
adult
institutions
for
men,
that
this
policy
is
essentially
a
classified
policy.
the
policy
itself
says
this
is
not
to
be
a
matter
of
public
dissemination
and
is
only
to
be
given
to
personnel
on
an
as
needed
basis.
the
inmates
who
receive
the
inmate
manual
in
the
long
term
segregation
unit
have
to
sign
for
it.
they
receive
a
number,
and
every
manual
has
to
be
returned.
apart
from
the
prison
grapevine,
which
all
of
us
know
there
is
a
prison
grapevine,
i
submit
that
it's...
it's
not
great
enough
to
tell
inmates
throughout
the
system
that,
in
fact,
if
you
get
into
the
long
term
segregation
unit,
this
very
small
unit,
that
you
may
lose
newspapers
and
magazines.
i
don't
think
it
is
known,
and
i
think
in
order
to
deter,
a
policy
has
to
be
publicized,
as
it
was
in
overton.
michigan
made
it
very
clear
to
the
prisoners,
that
if
they
got
involved
into
drug
violations,
that
their
visits
for
2
years
would
be
suspended.
and
if
i
may--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--well,
i
say
that
in
order
to
make
a
deterrence
argument,
at
least
an
argument
that
makes
sense
to
me,
that
in
order
to
deter
somebody
from
doing
something,
they
have
to
know
about
that
policy
and
they
have
to
know
what
the
consequences
are.
if
there
were
a
secret
policy
in
the
state
of
indiana
that
they,
you
know,
will
execute
persons
committing
first
degree
murder,
any
argument
that
that's
going
to...
that
the
death
penalty
is
going
to
act
as
a
deterrent
i
think--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--yes,
and...
and
i...
i
do
want
to
say...
and
i
don't
know
how
to
say
it
more...
more
clearly...
i
understand
it,
but
i'm
obviously
not
framing
this
in
a
way
that
is
getting
my
point
across.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
because
people...
these
are
the
most
incorrigible,
recalcitrant
inmates
in
the
entire
38,000
inmate
prison
system,
that
that
means
that
they
can
get
anything
that
they
want.
i'm
suggesting
that
when
you
take
away
a
very
significant
right...
and
that
is
the
ability
to
learn
what
is
happening
beyond
the
prison
walls...
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
doing
so.
now,
if
i've
been
reading
turner
and
o'lone
and
overton
incorrectly,
then
i'm
doing
a
disservice
to
my
clients.
mr.
jere
krakoff
security.
mr.
jere
krakoff
exactly.
mr.
jere
krakoff
well,
my...
my...
i
suppose
my
most
straightforward
answer
would
be
that
the
jewish
forward
can
burn
as
quickly
as
the
new
york
times,
that
the
christian
science
monitor--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--i
think
it's
a
realistic...
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
it's
a
realistic
response.
i'm
not
faulting
them.
i
applaud
them
for
doing
what
was
a
reasonable
thing.
mr.
jere
krakoff
right.
mr.
jere
krakoff
well,
there
are
other
things,
justice
ginsburg,
that
are
routinely
permitted
in...
in
the
cells
and,
in
fact,
that
probably
have
to
be
in
the
cells
that
can
be
used.
they're
given...
they're
giving...
given
writing
paper,
and
the
testimony
of
deputy
dickson
was
that
they...
they
fling
feces
with
writing
paper
and
they
fling
feces
quite
a
ways--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--well--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--the...
but
it's
not
only...
it's
not
only
writing
paper.
it's...
and
they
have
to
have
blankets.
the
blankets
are
flammable.
their
clothing
is
flammable.
the
bed
sheets
are
flammable.
mr.
jere
krakoff
no,
i
think
that
would
be
a
specious
argument.
mr.
jere
krakoff
but
if,
in
fact,
their
suggestion
is
that...
if
their
suggestion
is
that
the
inmates
are
less
likely
to
burn
a
bible,
for
example,
and
assuming
they're...
they're
christians
rather
than
somebody
else
who
has
the
bible,
they're
less
likely
to
burn
a...
the
bible
or
some
book
of
scriptures,
that
makes
sense.
but
when
you
suggest
that
they're
less
likely
to
burn
a
legal
newspaper
or
a
religious
newspaper,
that
doesn't
make
sense.
and
i'm
suggesting
this
isn't
a
question
of
equities
that
if
they're
nice
enough
to
permit
these
prisoners
to
read
religious
based
or
legal
based
newspapers
and
magazines,
that
forecloses
the
inmates
from
saying...
does
that
make
a
lot
of
sense?
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
jere
krakoff
right.
mr.
jere
krakoff
i
want
you
to
read
the
entire
brief--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--no.
i...
i
suggest
that
our...
my
brief
might
be
more
coherent
than
i
today.
[laughter]
and
i
think
we
make
out
a
strong
case...
that
we
make
out
a
strong
case
for
why
the
policy
in
question
is
not
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penological
interest.
i
would
suggest,
looking
at
another
aspect,
justice
breyer,
that
there
was
some
comment
about
the
adequacies
of
the...
the
alternatives,
the
other
avenues,
and
that's
an
important
consideration
under
the
second
prong
of...
of
turner.
and
i
think
it's...
it's
strange
to
suggest
that
the
prison
chaplain
who
visits
level
2
inmates
for
religious
purposes
and
that
attorneys,
assuming
that
an
inmate
has
an
attorney,
generally
are
going
to
come
discuss
either
a
section
1983
action
or
a
criminal
case,
and
that
relatives
once
a
month
for
an
hour
are
going
to
discuss
current
events,
and
that
they're
going
to
act
as
kind
of
a
quasi
wire
service
by--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--yes.
mr.
jere
krakoff
they're
actually,
your
honor--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--i
agree
with
that
point,
obviously.
but
every
inmate
in
disciplinary
confinement
stays
in
what
is
referred
to
as...
as
the
restricted
housing
unit,
and
they
all
know--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--well--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--yes.
mr.
jere
krakoff
yes,
but
i
suggest
that...
that
living
in
a
cage
and
exercising
in
a
case
in...
in
seclusion,
that's...
that's
a
prison
within
a
prison.
and
those
things
deter
normal
people,
people
who--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--at
some
point,
the
options
expire.
they
have
taken
so
much
away
from
these
prisoners.
is
that
going
to
then
justify?
say,
well,
we've
taken
everything
else
and
this
is
what
we
have
left.
is
that
the
kind
of
situation
where
deference
is
supposed
to
be
high
because
they're
making...
i
don't
see
that
as
a
real
choice.
they're
doing
what
they
have
available.
mr.
jere
krakoff
my...
my
response
is
that
they
have
taken
so
much
away
from
these
inmates
who
are
the
most
incorrigible,
recalcitrant
inmates
in
the
system.
and
they
say
in
their...
in
their
policy
that
these
inmates
are
either
unwilling
or
incapable
of
charging
their...
changing
their
behavior.
i
submit
that
some
of
these
men
probably
are,
and
i
think
it's
also
interesting
that
they--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--yes.
mr.
jere
krakoff
it
isn't.
that's...
that's
an
option
if
one
reaches
the
point
where
it
truly
is
cruel
and
unusual.
we
didn't
file
an
eighth
amendment
challenge
here
based
upon
the
facts
that
i
knew.
mr.
jere
krakoff
no.
and...
and
i
think
that...
i
know
in
overton
there
was
a
dissent
by
justices
thomas
and
scalia
that
essentially
said
that
that's
what
you
have.
you...
you
have
an
eighth
amendment
argument
if
a
policy
rises
to
that
level,
but
if
a
policy
doesn't
constitute
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
then
you're
out
of
luck.
and
that
kind
of
swallows
up
the
first
amendment
in
my
view
and
the
other...
and
other
amendments
as
well.
now,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
not
that
they've
reached
the
point
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
i'm
suggesting
that
there
comes
a
time
when
you
take
away
so
many
things
from
these
prisoners,
that
you
basically...
yes,
you
may
have
to
give
up
and
you
may
have
to
keep
them
in
segregation.
and
they
do
keep
men
in
segregation...
other
forms...
for
10,
15...
i
represented
a
man
who
had
been
in
segregation
for
30
years.
so
it's
not
as
though
that's
unusual.
they
do
give
up
on
people
in...
in
the
pennsylvania
prison
system
all
of
the
time.
that
would
not
be
unusual.
i
suggest
that
if
we
reach
the
point
where
the
law
says
that
if
you
run
out
of
options,
you
can
do
anything
that
you
want
as
long
as
it
doesn't
rise
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
that
we
may
as
well
forget
about--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--well,
i...
i--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--well,
it...
unless
there
are
other
questions,
i
think
i've
reached--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--the...
the
rules
themselves
say
kind
of
in
a
preamble
that...
that
confinement
is
for
a
minimum
of
90
days,
but
that
often
it's...
it's
longer
than
that--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--well,
there
were...
there
were
10
inmates
in
the
first
2
and
half
years
of
the
operation,
according
to
deputy
dickson,
who
had
moved
out
of...
out
of
the
unit.
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
any
of
these
inmates
ordered
subscriptions
for
newspapers
or
magazines.
so
we
don't
know
whether
that
even
arguably
was
a
factor.
i
think
that
the...
that
the
state
has
acknowledged
that
there
might
be
many
reasons
why
inmates
might
leave
the
long
term
segregation
unit
that
could
be
unrelated
to
the...
the,
quote,
incentive
of
newspapers
and
magazines.
so
we
don't
know
whether
any
of
them
have
left
because
they've
simply
gotten
tired
of
being
in
segregation
for
2
and
a
half
additional
years,
after
flunking
out
of
the
special
management
units,
or
whether
there
were
other...
other
factors.
two...
what...
what
is
concerning
is
that
two
inmates
left
straight
from
the
unit
to
the
streets
because
their
sentences
expired.
and
so
they
were
essentially
people
who...
you
know,
they...
they
could
read
about
the...
an
ancient
war
in
the
bible,
but
they
couldn't
read
about
iraq.
so
they
were
going
to
have...
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
healthy
situation.
that's
not
from
a
constitutional
perspective,--
mr.
jere
krakoff
--but
from
a
practical
perspective.
mr.
jere
krakoff
special
management
unit?
mr.
jere
krakoff
well,
all...
the
various
incentives...
there's
no
possibility
of
earning
access
to
radios
or
televisions
in
the
long
term
segregation
unit.
the
most
there
can
be
would
be
twice
a...
twice
a
month
visits
if
they're
promoted
to
level
1,
as
opposed
to
four
time
a
month
visits
if
they
succeed
in
the
special
management
unit.
there's
no
opportunity
for
out
of
cell
group
activities
while
in
the
long
term
segregation
unit.
they
lose
that
as
an...
that's
not
an
incentive.
that
is
an
incentive
in
the
special
management
unit.
there's
no
probationary
period
where
they
can
be
released
to
a
general
population
cell
block
which,
as
the
court
knows,
a
general
population
cell
block
is...
offers
many
opportunities
that
segregated
cell
blocks
don't.
and
that's
not
available.
mr.
jere
krakoff
thank
you.
