what
is
the
reason
that...
that
the
state
or
the
regulations
allow
paperbacks
from
the
library
and
not
current
events?
i'm
just...
that...
the
rationality
of...
of
that
line
escapes
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
the
concern
is
the
safety
concern,
then
you
would
have
an
equal
concern
with
the
jewish
daily
forward,
which
is
a
newspaper
format,
or...
and
i
don't
know
what
the
watchtower
comes
out
in
these
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does
the...
what
does
the
inmate
have
to
show
in
order
to
go
to
the
law
library?
that
is,
suppose
the
inmate's
position
is
i
want
to
go
there
and
i
want
to
read
law
week
and
legal
times
and
other...
i
want
to
see
what's
new,
what's
breaking
in
the
law
so
that
maybe
i'll
have
something
i
can
put
in
a
petition,
and
that's
why
i
want
to
go
every...
every
chance
i
get
to
the
law
library.
could
such
an
inmate
go
to
the
library?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
would
mean
that
the
inmate
could
go
and
look
at
the
legal
newspapers,
but
not...
not
the
christian
science
monitor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
he
could
get
law
week,
legal
times,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
national
law
journal.
all
of
those
he
could
get.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
there,
there
was
a
genuine
security
concern,
which
i
think
you
pretty
much
said
doesn't
exist
here
when
you
consider
what
they
can
have
in...
in
the
cell.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
apart
from
those
two,
access
to
the
courts
and
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
then
anything
goes
for
this
set
of
incorrigible
prisoners?
they
can
take
away...
the
first
amendment,
in
other
words,
is
out
the
window.
they
have
no
first
amendment
rights
that
the
state
needs
to
respect.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but...
but
for
this...
for
this
group,
while
they're
in
that
situation,
essentially
there's
no
first
amendment
rights.
i
think
that's
what
your...
your
argument.
they
can
regain
them,
but
that's
the
purpose
of
the
behavioral
modification
program.
but
the...
the
only
thing
that
these
prisoners
get
is
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
let's
say
if...
if
the
flaw
is
it
doesn't
deter
other
people
because
they
don't
know
about
it,
then
if
they...
if
they
broadcast
it
all
over
so
everyone
knows
about
it,
then
it's
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
using
that
to
say
that
the
security
concern
doesn't
hold
up
because
of
the
papers
that
they're
allowed
to
have
in
their
cells
can
be
used
similarly
for
fires,
similarly
to
do
other
bad
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
thought
that's
why
you
were
using
that,
just
to
say
that
the...
the
security
concern
is
dubious
because
the
materials
that
they
are
allowed
to
have
in
their
cells
can...
could
achieve
exactly
the
same
end.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
other
than
the
periodical,
newspaper
access
differentiates
this
custody
from
the
next
higher--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
