mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
policy
challenged
in
this
case
applies
to
a
small
class
of
dangerous,
disruptive
inmates,
all
confined
at
level
2
of
the
long
term
segregation
unit,
which
is
the
most
restrictive
custody
in
the
pennsylvania
prison
system.
these
central
facts
inform
every
aspect
of
the
turner
analysis
which
governs
the
outcome
of
this
case.
the
denial
of
periodicals
and
photographs,
with
the
opportunity
to
earn
them
back
by
improved
behavior,
is
logically
connected
both
to
rehabilitation
and
security.
level
2
inmates
have
a...
have
failed
every
attempt
at
rehabilitation.
yet,
nearly
all
of
them
will
be
released
from
prison.
the
goal
at
level
2
is
to
turn
these
inmates
around,
to
improve
their
behavior
enough
that
they
can
be
advanced
safely
to
programs
with
more
opportunities
for
self
improvement.
until
that
happens--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--less
than
40.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
well,
the
duration
of...
of
confinement
at
level
2
varies
widely
from
one
inmate
to
another
because
it
is
affected
by
their
improvement.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
the
record
does
not
tell
us
how
long
most
of
them
have
been
there.
at
the
time
of
the
case
in
the
trial
court,
which
was
2002,
25
percent
of
them
had
been
promoted
to
level
1
or
had
been
released
from
the
long
term
segregation
unit
altogether.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
at
that
time,
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
well,
realistically
it's
in
between.
again,
the...
the
unit
had
only
been
in
operation
for
2
years
at
time
that
the
record
was
made.
so
there's
very
little--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--they're...
they're
moved
when
their
behavior
improves.
the
average
over
a
long
period
of
time
has
been
in
the
range
of
a
year
or
so.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
through
today?
i'm
sorry.
oh,
from
the
time
of
its
inception?
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
until
the
2-year
point.
yes,
there
were.
i
don't
know
exactly
how
many
there
were,
but
there
definitely
were.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
there's
a
wide
variation
of
privilege
grants
and
withdrawals
even
at
the
highest
levels
of
security.
the
aclu's
amicus
brief
points
to
three
other
states
that...
that
have
the
same
program
as
pennsylvania,
and
frankly,
i'm
not
even
sure
as
to
those,
that
it's
identical.
but
the
court
has
recognized
that...
that
these
sorts
of
variations,
particularly
when
we're
talking
about
high
security
prisoners,
are
precisely
what
turner
contemplates.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
i'm
sure
that
it
is.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
well,
there's...
there
is
certainly
a
security
component
to
it.
paperback
books,
small,
compact,
much
more
difficult
to
use
as
weapons,
and
the
experience
of
the
prison
staff
that
operate
this
high
security
unit
is
that
newspapers
and
magazines
are...
have
been
a...
a
frequent
source
of
mischief.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
actually
inmates,
particularly
the
worst
of
the
worst,
are
quite
clever
at
using
newspapers.
a
newspaper
rolled
tightly
with
toothpaste
used
as
an
adhesive
can
be
compacted
into
very
nearly
the
equivalent
of
a
nightstick.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
the
experience
of
prison
officials
is
that,
yes,
it
is,
and...
and
actually
it's
very
common
in
prison
systems
to
distinguish,
for
example,
between
hardback
books
and
paperbacks.
yes,
it's...
these
are
difficult
lines
to
draw,
and
that's
where
the
professional
expertise
of
the
people
who
deal
with
the
problems
every
day
comes
into
play.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
yes.
well,
justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
experience
of
prison
administrators
is
that
prisoners
are
less
likely
to
use
religious
and
legal
materials
for
mischief,
and
as
to
paperbacks
as
well,
they
do
supply
an
alternative
means
of
receiving
information
from
outside
the
prison.
but
again,
if
i...
if
i
allude
frequently
to
the
experience
of
prison
administrators,
it's...
it's
because
that's
what
these...
this
policy
is
guided
by.
newspapers
and
magazines
have
a
high
value
to
inmates.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
yes,
and
that
is...
is
the
primary
purpose
of
the
policy
overall,
and--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--actually--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--inmates
at
level
2
are
not
permitted
to
go
to
the
prison
library.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
they
can
order
books
from
the
library.
they
are
allowed
to
visit
the...
the
mini
law
library
that's
proximate
to
the
unit.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
having--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--there's
definitely
a
security
reason.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
allowing
the...
the
inmate
to
request
to
go
to
the
mini
law
library
for
an
additional
purpose
or
for
a
separate
purpose
to
read
periodicals
puts
increased
demand
on
going
there,
and
moving
these
inmates
is
a...
a
very
demanding
operation.
it
requires
two
officers
and
physical
restraints
and
going
through
layers
of
security.
so
it
puts
increased
demands
on
prison
resources.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
yes.
the
inmate
may
go
to
the
law
library
subject
to
the
limitation
of
one
inmate
at
a
time,
subject
to
the
sign
up
list.
the
inmate
may
get--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--the
christian
science
monitor
is
not
available
to
him
in
the...
in
the
mini
law
library,
and...
and
actually,
if
he
wanted
to
subscribe,
he
could
receive
a...
a
legal
periodical
in
his
cell.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
subject--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--subject
to
the
content
restriction
of
religious
and
legal
materials
that
would
fit
in
one
property
box,
he
may.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
yes.
yes,
justice
souter,
the
state
could,
as
long
as
the
overall
turner
analysis
is
observed.
and,
in
particular,
i
think
that
would
implicate
the
availability...
the
availability
of
alternative
means
of
exercising
the
asserted
right
to
receive
information
from
outside
the
prison.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
the
inmate
would
still
have
unlimited
access
to
counsel
visits
and
can
still
visit
the
mini
law
library
and
do
his
own
legal
research,
even
if
he's
not
allowed
to
subscribe
to
or...
or
keep
legal
materials,
legal
periodicals
in
his
own
cell.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
ultimately
any
prisoner
is...
is
free
to
challenge
the
adequacy
of
his
ability
to
access
the
courts
in
a...
in
an
as
applied
challenge
to
his
own
conditions.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
definitely.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
well,
the
marriage
ban,
justice
souter,
of
course,
is
subject
to
turner
analysis
as
well,
and
i
think
that
where
turner
might
bring
up
short
a
ban
on
marriage
for
these
high
security
inmates
is
in
the...
the
logical
connection
to
the
rehabilitative
purpose
in
that
there
being
so
few
inmates
and
marriage
is
going
to
be
such
an
infrequent
occasion,
it's
hard
to
see
the
marriage
ban
as
influencing
level
2
inmates
generally
to
improve
their
behavior.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
that...
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
that...
that
implicates--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--yes.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
well,
you
could
say
that
about
all...
probably
a
range
of
things
if
you
went
so
far
as
to
query
each
inmate
as
to
what
it
is
that
they
value
most
or
what
it
is
they're
most
interested
in
doing--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--it
would
be
an
interesting
program
and
i
would
defend
it
that
you
could
query
inmates
on
what
is
most
valuable
and
then
deprive
them
of
it
subject
to--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
we
need
to
get
around
the
marriage
case
in
the
sense
that,
particularly
as
to
high
security
inmates,
prison
officials
have
very
wide
discretion
to
fashion
policies
that
serve
the
goals.
and...
and
to
do
it--
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
--it
could
be
banned,
but
i
do
think
that
it
would
be
subject
to
a...
a
pointed
challenge
on
the
logical
connection,
but
in
theory,
it's...
it
is
one
of
the
instruments...
a
privilege
that
could
be
withdrawn
for
behavior
modification
purposes.
this
case
is...
is
exceedingly
similar
to
overton
where
the
court
directly
observed
that
withdrawing
visitation
privileges
is
a
proper
and
even
necessary
technique
to...
to
improve
the
behavior
especially
of
high
security
prisoners
who
have
few
privileges
left...
left
to
lose,
which
is
precisely
the
same
situation
that
we're
presented
with
in
this
case.
turner
too...
i'm
sorry.
overton
as
well
is
instructive
on
the
subject
of
adequate
alternatives.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
i
think
that...
that
in
both
overton
and
this
case,
there
were
both
behavior
modification
and
security
concerns.
and
i'm
not
even
sure
that
their
weight...
they're
weighted
as
between
the
two
altogether
different
between
the
two
cases.
actually
all
of
the
discussion
in
overton
was
in
the
context
of
behavior
modification,
which
is
related
both
to
security
and
to
rehabilitation.
but
the...
the
tenor
of
the
discussion
was
actually,
i
would
say,
more
directed
to
rehabilitation.
the
court
recognized
in
overton,
as
adequate
alternative
means
of
exercising
the
right,
letters
and
phone
calls.
the
inmates
in
this
case
have
the
opportunity
of
unlimited
correspondence,
family,
chaplain,
and
counsel
visits,
and
as...
as
we've
talked
about,
books
from
the
prison
library.
quickly
addressing
the
last
two
turner
factors,
accommodating
the
asserted
right
would
altogether
defeat
the
goals
of
the
policy.
it
would
have,
as
i
alluded
to
when
i
did
speak
of
security,
a
significant
impact
on
guards
and
prison
resources,
and
there
are
no
ready
alternatives.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
very
briefly,
if...
if
i
might
turn
myself
to
just
the
very
first
point
that
mr.
krakoff
made
about
inmates
being
compelled
to
stay
in
the
long
term
segregation
unit
until
they
complete
their
disciplinary
custody.
i
would
draw
your
attention
to
pages
40
and
41
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
show
that...
that
the
unit
manager
has
the
authority
to
set
aside
disciplinary
custody,
and
an
inmate
who
graduates
the
long
term
segregation
unit
gets
all
of
their
disciplinary
custody
set
aside
completely.
so
in
a
sense,
the...
the
disciplinary
custody
aspect
is
another
incentive.
mr.
louis
j.
rovelli
the
principal
means
by
which
other
prisoners
would
know
about
it
is
the
very
effective
prison
grapevine,
although
it
does
appear
in
the...
in
a
chart
that's
appended
to
the
handbook
for
the
special
management
unit,
and
75
percent
of
the
inmates
who
wind
up
at
level
2
come
from
the
special
management
unit.
the
other
thing
i
would
point
out
about
the
effectiveness
of
this
program,
as
opposed
to
the
give
up
on
them
proposition,
is
that
even
at...
even
in
2002,
when
the
program
was
only
2
years
old,
25
percent
of
the
inmates
who
had
been
sent
there
had
graduated.
the
statistics
on
that
are
at
pages
7
and
8
of
our
reply
brief.
finally,
if...
if
the
court
were
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
then
this
case
has
to
be
sent
back
to
trial
and
the
burden
is
put
on
the
prison
system
to
demonstrate
empirically
that
this
regulation
can
achieve
its
goals.
in
a
sense,
i've
just
demonstrated
that
it
has
achieved
its
goals,
but
much
more
importantly,
the
effect
of
that
would
be
to
totally
undermine,
if
not
void,
turner
and
overton.
