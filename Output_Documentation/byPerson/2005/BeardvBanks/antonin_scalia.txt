scalia
can
we
explain
that?
how
does
one
use
a
newspaper
as
a
weapon?
i
mean,
you
know,
maybe
disciplining
a
dog
or
something.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
do...
do
you
concede
that
just
because
a
right
is
enumerated,
it
means
it
cannot
be
entirely
taken
away
in
prison?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
like,
you
know,
try
the
right
to
bear
arms.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
changing
other
people's
behavior?
your...
your
assertion
that
it
does
no
good
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
it
has
not
altered
the
behavior
of
these
people
who
are
in
the
unit.
but
what
about
other
people
who
don't
want
to
get
thrown
in
the
unit?
i
mean,
don't
you
have
to
look
at
the
deterrent
effect?
and...
and
is
it
easy
for
you
to
say
that
the...
that...
that
the
in
terrorem
effect
of
being
deprived
of...
of
literature,
television,
or
whatever
has
not
induced
other
people
to
shape
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
what
kind
of
a
fire
you
can
make
with
the
sunday
new
york
times?
[laughter]
are
you
going
to...
are
you
going
to
compare
that
to
writing
paper
and...
and
to...
to
the
jewish
advocate
or
whatever
it
is?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
reasonable
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
i
could
say
the
same
thing
about
going
to
jail,
i
mean,
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
could
say
whether
i'm
there
23
hours
or
all
or
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
enough
of
an
incentive
that
i...
that
i
don't
want
to
go
to
jail.
there's...
there's
incentives
and
there's
incentives.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rovelli,
do
the
other
prisoners
know
about
this?
i'd
like
you
to
respond
to
the...
to
the
assertion
that
nobody
knows
about
this
anyway,
so
it
doesn't
deter
anybody.
