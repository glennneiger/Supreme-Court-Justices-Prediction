were
there
any
prisoners,
since
the
inception
to
your
program,
that
have
been
in
there
for
the
whole
2
years?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are...
do...
is...
is
pennsylvania
alone
or
nearly
alone
in
imposing
this
rule,
or
is
this
typical
of
the
restraints
imposed
in...
in
this
maximum
restrictive
confinement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
one
of
the
most
severe
restrictions
in
the
nation
with
respect
to
reading
material
and
photographs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
an
as
applied
challenge.
if...
if
a
particular
inmate...
the
terms
of...
the
conditions
of
confinement
are
particularly
harsh
and
he...
he
or
she
has
an
unrealistic
opportunity
to
get
to
a
less
restrictive
confinement,
then...
then
he
can
bring
a
suit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but...
the
whole
rationale
of
your
case...
if
i
were
you
writing
your
brief,
i
would
have
this
problem.
this
really
matters
to
the
inmates,
but
that's
exactly
the
state's
point.
that's
the
reason
it's
taken
away.
it
really
means
something.
and
i...
i
just...
i
just
don't
know
what
to
do
with
that
conundrum.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
heart
of
your
case
and
that
it
surfaces
here
in
the
answers
you've
attempted
to
give.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
whole
basis
of
the
suit
is
that
it
matters
to
the
prisoner,
and
that's
exactly
why
it's
been
taken
away
because
there's
nothing
else
left
that
we
can
do
with
these
prisoners.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
the
state's
position
is
that
it
wants
to
avoid
that
ultimate
deterrent.
it...
it
wants
to
take
away
privileges
for
a
while
to
see
if
he
can
conform.
you're
depriving
the
state
of
the...
of
the
option
to
avoid
the
most
extreme
circumstances
of
forgetting
about
him
altogether
forever.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
your...
your
argument
is...
is
at
cross
ends
with
its
own
purpose.
