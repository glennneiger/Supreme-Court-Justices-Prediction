justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why...
let's
see.
they
go
to
the
prison
library
what?
once
every
couple
of
weeks
or
what?
once
a
week?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one...
one
visit
per
month.
and...
and
how
often
do
they
go
to
the
prison
library?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
ordered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
what
it
says...
that's
what...
it
says,
to
review
legal
materials,
one
at
a
time
may
be
let
out
of
his
cell
and
is
escorted
to
a
mini
law
library
in
hand.
all
right.
why
couldn't
you
have
a...
if
he
wants
to
see
the
newspaper
in
that
mini
law
library,
why
couldn't
there
be
a
copy
there,
only
the
parts
that
are
consistent
with
the
censorship
policy,
just
like
a
news
of
the
day.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
security
reason
or
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
a
security
reason
when
he's
there
in
leg
irons
looking
at
the
books,
the
law
books,
in
the
mini
law
library?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
there
other...
are
there
other
bases?
because
so
far
your
argument
is
they're
so
bad
that
you
might
as
well
give
them
whatever
they
want
because
it
won't
matter.
[laughter]
now,
i'm
parodying
it,
but
you
understand
why
i
don't
think
it's
your
strongest
for
the
reasons
said.
but
are
there
others
which
might
be
a
little...
you
had
other
arguments--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
law.
i
understand
your
argument.
your
argument
that
you
have
made
is,
at
the
very
least,
you
can't
say
that
this
deterrent
effect
is
that
big
a
deal.
i
mean,
now,
there
were
other
reasons
justifying
it.
they
said,
for
example,
if
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
and
they
made
a
big
case
in
this.
it's
on
188
in
the
appendix.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
made
a
major
point.
they
said
that
with
the
newspapers,
they
set
fires,
they
throw
feces.
they
use
them
as
a
spear,
and
then
when
asked,
why
couldn't
you
do
the
same
with
library
books,
or
couldn't
you
do
the
same
with
paperbacks,
they
said,
yes,
it's
possible,
but
it's
less
likely
because
of
the
size
of
the
document.
and
we
don't
have
to
forbid
everything.
we
just
forbid
the
things
that
we
think
are
particularly
likely.
now,
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
what
is
it
that
i
should
read
then
in
respect
to
what's
actually
bothering
me?
in
turner
v.
safley--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
court
says
we
resolve,
when
a
prison
regulation
impinges
on
an
inmate's
constitutional
rights,
which
is
does
here,
the
regulation
is
valid
if
it
is
reasonably
related
to
legitimate
penological
interests.
that
standard
is
necessary
if
prison
administrators
and
not
the
courts
are
to
make
the
difficult
judgments
concerning
institutional
operations.
and
that's
where
i
think
it's
difficult
to
balance
this
case.
if
we
were
to
decide
for
you,
are
we
going
too
far
in
interfering
on
what
the
prison
administrators
should
be
doing,
or
have
they
gone
too
far?
now,
if
i'm
supposed
to
look
at
this
record
and
try
and
make
up
my
mind,
which
i
think
is
about
that
question,
what
do
you
want
me
to
look
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'll
read
the
briefs.
i
have
no
problem
with
the
briefs--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
pennsylvania’s
prison
system
has
a
policy
of
denying
newspapers,
magazines
and
personal
photographs
to
a
small
group
of
about
40
inmates,
who
share
the
fact
that
they
have
particular
problems
of
behavior,
they
flunked
out
of
special
disciplinary
programs
or
in
various
other
ways
they
have
shown
themselves
what
they
characterize
as
”the
worst
of
the
worst”
in
the
prison
system.
now,
a
former
inmate
of
that
program
attacked
the
policy
here
as
unconstitutional,
and
the
state
defended
it,
and
at
the
trial
both
sides
moved
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
state;
the
3rd
circuit
reversed;
now,
we
are
reversing
the
3rd
circuit.
so
we
think
summary
judgment
was
right
in
this
case
for
the
state.
i
am
announcing
the
judgment
of
the
court
here,
and
i’ll
give
the
reasoning
of
four
justices;
only
eight
of
us
are
participating,
justice
alito
is
not.
the
four
justices
are
myself,
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
souter.
in
the
view
of
the
four
of
us,
the
case
turns
on
three
sets
of
legal
requirements:
first,
the
constitution
permits
policies
in
prisons
that
would
otherwise
be
forbidden,
policies
that
affect
free
speech,
confinement
and
so
forth,
provided
that
those
policies
are
reasonable
ones
in
the
circumstances,
and
a
case
called
turner
elaborates
on
that;
second,
when
we
are
looking
at
these
matters,
we
owe
prison
officials
a
degree
of
deference
when
they
exercise
their
professional
judgment,
and
a
case
called
overton
elaborates
on
that;
and,
third,
on
a
summary-judgment
motion,
such
as
we
have
here
in
this
case,
the
defendant
makes
a
motion,
the
prison
makes
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment,
and
they
have
to
show
they're
entitled
to
it,
and
then
it’s
up
to
the
plaintiff,
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
to
point
to
evidence
that
raises
a
triable
issue
of
fact,
and
a
case
called
*2:12
cellitex
elaborates
on
that.
so
we
have
examined
the
record
here,
and
we
conclude
that
the
trial
court
was
right
in
granting
summary
judgment
for
the
prison.
that's
because
the
secretary
attached
a
deposition
to
his
motion
for
summary
judgment
where
a
prison
official
explained
the
policy
and
explained
its
justification.
in
particular,
the
official
explained
that
these
are
the
40
most
corrigible
inmates
in
the
system;
previously,
they
had
been
deprived
of
almost
every
privilege
it’s
possible
to
deprive
them
of,
all
without
success;
and
the
right
to
read
magazines
and
newspapers
and
have
some
personal
photographs
is
almost
all
that's
left.
they
can
escape
the
policy
after
90
days
by
improving
their
behavior.
about
25%
do
that
or
have
done
that
over
the
span
of
2
years
and
so
forth.
now,
in
response
to
the
secretary’s
showing,
the
plaintiff
did
not
offer
to
present
evidence
by
experts
or
by
laypeople
or
even
to
cross-examine
the
prison
officials
further.
rather,
the
plaintiff
offered
to
present
nothing.
he
just
said
it
was
unlawful,
provided
reasons.
so
given
the
deposition,
the
justification
for
the
policy,
the
fact
that
it
applies
to
a
small
group
and
is
potentially
temporary,
in
the
absence
of
any
contrary
evidence,
we
conclude
that
summary
judgment
for
the
prison
is
warranted.
we
are
not
saying
the
policy
is
immune
from
constitutional
attack;
we
just
say
that
the
attack
that
we
are
seeing
is
the
one
contained
in
the
record
before
us,
and
that
attack
could
not
succeed.
we
reverse
the
3rd
circuit’s
determination.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
in
which
justice
scalia
joined;
justice
stevens
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joined;
and
finally,
justice
ginsberg
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
of
her
own;
justice
alito,
as
i
said,
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
