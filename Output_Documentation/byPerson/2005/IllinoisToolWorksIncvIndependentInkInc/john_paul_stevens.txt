do
you
think
there's
a
distinction...
do
you
think
there's
a
distinction
between
components
in
cases
where
there's
a
one
on
one
relationship
between
the
tied
product
and
the
tying
product
and
cases
like
this
which
involve
metering?
do
you
think
there's
a
different
possible
approach
between
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
earlier
point
was
we
know
that
a
whole
lot
of
patents
are
not
all
that
important.
but
is
it
not
fair
to
assume
that
when
a
patent
can
generate
metering
in
this
particular
kind
of
situation,
that
it...
that
it's
a
likelihood
that
it
has
more
power
than
the
average
patent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it's...
if
it
is
true,
as
your
opponent
says...
and
i
don't
know
if
it
is
or
not...
that
you're
able
to
get
twice
the
price
for
the
ink
than
you
otherwise
would
get,
does
that...
is
that
any
evidence
of
market
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
were
what
the
record
reflected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
also
true
that
some...
some
economists
disagree?
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
there's
disagreement
among
economists,
shall
we
take
one
view
over
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask
you
how
far
your
position
extends?
i
think
there's
a
good
argument
that
if
a
patent
is
really
a
good
patent,
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
the
patentee
charges
a
very
high
royalty
or
gets
a...
reduces
the
royalty
and
gets
profits
out
of
the
tied...
tied
product.
in
your
view,
is
the
rule
sound
that
if
it
is
a
monopoly
in
the
tied
product,
that
there
is
an
antitrust
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in...
in
the
tying
product.
excuse
me.
in
the
tying
product.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
that's
all
you're
asking
for--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
i'm
just
wondering
if
it
isn't...
if
it
isn't
the
logical
conclusion
of
your
position
that
it
really
doesn't
matter,
even
if
there
is
a
monopoly
in
the
tying
product.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm...
i'm
asking
sort
of
an
economic
question
rather
than
a
legal
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
your
position
is
all
the
economists
say
this
is
a
lot
of
nonsense,
i
think
maybe
it's
a
lot
of
nonsense
even
if
there's
a
monopoly
in
the
tying
product
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wouldn't
be
a
new
one.
it
would
be
just
following
the
old
ibm
case
and
all
those
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
that's
the
example
they're
saying
it
would
be
following.
it's
not
a
brand
new
idea.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your...
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
is
there
should
be
no
distinction
even
if
there
is
evidence
that
there's
a
long
term
relationship,
a
requirements
relationship,
and
an
increase
in
price.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
that
also
true
even
if
there's
monopoly
power?
that's
what...
i
really
think
it's
a
very
interesting
question
as
to
whether
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
monopolist
who
happens
to
have
a
patent
just
charges
high
prices
for
product
a
or
decides
to
charge
a
little
less
for
product
a
and
make
hay
out
of
product
b.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
understand
it's
not.
i'm
just
kind
of
curious
about
where
we're
going
down...
we're
going
down
a
new
road
in
this
whole
area.
i'm
just
wondering
how...
what
our
destination
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
talking
about
components,
for
example.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
makes
any
difference
whether
general
motors
has
a
monopoly
or
not
when
it
wants
to
sell,
you
know,
two
components
as
part
of
the
same
package.
anyway,
i've
gone
astray
too
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
to
interrupt
to
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
think
your
opponent
would
say
the
district
court
made
a
finding
to
the
contrary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
kind
of
curious
what
your
answer
is
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
question
is
does
the
presumption
make
any
sense
at
all
outside
of
the
requirements
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
remember
the
text
of
section
3,
it
applies
to
other
products
patented
or
unpatented.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
one
of
the
interesting
aspects
of
this
kind
of
discrimination
is
the
victim
of
the
discrimination
is
the
more
powerful
buyer
in
these
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
you
can
do
that
under
modern
computer
technology.
you
couldn't
have
done
it
20
years
ago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
an
antitrust
tying
clause
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
petitioners
own
patents
on
components
of
printing
equipment
that
is
used
to
print
bar
codes
on
a
variety
of
packaging
materials.
licensees
of
their
patented
equipment,
the
tying
product,
are
required
to
buy
specially
designed,
but
unpatented
ink,
the
tied
product,
from
petitioners.
respondent,
a
competing
producer
of
ink,
contends
that
the
tying
arrangement
violates
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
for
petitioners,
because
there
was
no
proof
that
they
possessed
market
power
in
the
tying
product;
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
relying
on
decisions
of
this
court
that
have
held
that
the
fact
that
the
tying
product
is
patented
is
sufficient
to
establish
market
power
for
antitrust
purposes.
it
concluded
that
even
if
the
district
court’s
decision
represented
sound
policy,
it
was
the
duty
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
follow
our
precedents
until
we
choose
to
overrule
them
expressly.
the
principal
case
supporting
the
presumption
that
a
patent
always
establishes
the
market
power
is
the
international
salt
company
against
the
united
states,
a
case
decided
during
the
1947
term.
in
that
case,
the
court
accepted
the
government’s
submission
that
earlier
cases
applying
a
judicially
created
patent-misuse
doctrine
to
tying
arrangements
should
be
applied
in
the
antitrust
context.
the
rule
of
the
international
salt
case
was
enthusiastically
endorsed
not
only
by
the
enforcement
agencies,
but
also
in
later
opinions
stating
the
tying
arrangements
serve
hardly
any
purpose
beyond
the
suppression
of
competition.
over
the
years,
however,
the
rule
was
subjected
to
growing
criticism
by
scholars
and
patent
lawyers
who
pointed
out
that
some
tying
arrangements
actually
benefit
competition,
and
eventually
the
department
of
justice
and
the
federal
trade
commission
adopted
a
policy
statement
disavowing
the
presumption.
of
greatest
significance,
however,
in
1988,
congress
amended
the
patent
code
to
eliminate
the
market-power
presumption
in
patent-misuse
cases.
after
considering
the
congressional
judgment
repudiating
the
patent-law
rule
that
had
provided
the
basis
for
the
decision
in
the
international
salt
case,
we
have
concluded
that
in
antitrust
tying
cases,
as
in
patent-misuse
cases,
market
power
must
be
established
by
proof
rather
than
a
mere
presumption.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
our
judgment
is
unanimous;
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
