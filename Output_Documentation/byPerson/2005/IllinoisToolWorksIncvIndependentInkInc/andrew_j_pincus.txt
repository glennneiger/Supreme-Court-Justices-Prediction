mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
its
opinion
in
jefferson
parish,
the
court
stated
that
the
key
characteristic
of
illegal
tying
is
the
seller's
exploitation
of
its
control
over
the
tying
product
to
force
the
purchase
of
the
tied
product.
the
court
held
that
the
per
se
rule
against
tying
applies
only
if
the
plaintiff
proves
that
the
seller
has...
and
i'm
quoting
from
that
opinion.
the
quote
is
on
page
12
of
our
brief...
the
special
ability,
usually
called
market
power,
to
force
the
purchaser
to
do
something
that
he
would
not
do
in
a
competitive
market.
if
the
court
were
confronted
today
for
the
first
time
with
the
question
whether
the
presence
of
a
patent
on
some
aspect
of
the
tying
product
by
itself
demonstrates
the
existence
of
this
forcing
power,
it's
inconceivable
that
the
court
would
adopt
that
rule.
not
only
is
there
no
empirical
evidence
to
support
it,
there's
no
logical
basis
for
such
a
presumption.
the
focus
of
patent
rights
is
very
different
from
antitrust
market
analysis.
patent
rights
are
tied
to
a
particular
invention.
market
power
is
buyer
centric.
a
buyer
may
be
able
to
choose
from
a
number
of
different
products,
some
patented,
some
not,
to
satisfy
his
or
her
need.
the
existence
of
a
patent
on
one
of
those
devices
does
not
preclude
at
all
the
existence
of
alternatives
that
are
equally
attractive,
maybe
even
more
attractive,
to
the
customer.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
absolutely,
your
honor.
one
of
the...
one
of
the
evils
of
the
presumption
is
that
there's
nothing
that
says
that
the
patent
has
to
be
on
the
entire
product.
the...
the
patent
could
be
on
a
component
of
a
product.
and
in
today's
world,
as
your
honor
says,
television
sets,
cd
devices,
cell
phones,
all
of
those
devices
are
loaded
with
components,
one
of
which
may
happen
to
be
patented.
it
may
not
be
the
one
that
makes
the...
it
may
not
have
to
do
with
anything
that
makes
that
product
attractive
in
the
marketplace,
but
the
presence
of
that
patent
would
be
relied
upon
to
make
the
presumption
applicable.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think...
i
think
the
theory
of
the
application
of
the
presumption
is,
first
of
all,
obviously,
if
the
whole
product
is
patented,
then
the
presumption
would
be
applicable.
but
i
think
there
also
is
an
argument
that
even
if
some
component
is...
is
patented,
that
component,
because
it's
in
that
product,
gives
that
product
market
power
because
the
theory
would
go
the
patent
would
exclude
the
ability
of
other
competitors
in
the
market
to
use
that
component.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
then
i
think
the
argument--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
you
could,
but
i
think
the
question...
the
question
would
be
whether
that
product
as
a
whole
in
the
marketplace,
which
is...
part
of
it
is
made
up
by
this
component.
the
argument
would
be,
if
i'm
a
competitor,
i
can't
duplicate
that
product
because
that
component
is
patented,
and
therefore,
that
product
that
contains
the
patented
component
should
get
the
benefit
of
this
market
power
presumption.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
at
the...
at
the
time
that...
that
the
inventions
are
patented,
it's
not
clear...
many
inventors
don't
know
what
the
market
value
of
their
product
will
be.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--our
system
encourages...
there...
it...
it
certainly
is
possible
there
are
many
patents
that...
that
are...
there
are
many
inventions
that
are
patented
that
don't
have
value
in
the
marketplace.
there
are
some
that
do.
the
problem
with
this--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
but
the
fact--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
there
are...
there
are
two
answers
to
that
question.
first
of
all,
there's
no
empirical
showing
and...
and
no
logical
evidence
that
there...
the
set
of
valuable
patents
is
larger
than
the
set
of
valueless
ones.
and,
in
fact,
it's
probably
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary,
that
the
set
of
valueless
patents
is
quite
considerable.
so
by
creating
a
presumption
and
shifting
the
burden
based
on
something
that's
demonstrably
not
true
doesn't
have
a
logical
basis.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
respondent
has
moved
away
from...
from
the
loew's
assertion
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
patent
shows
uniqueness
sufficient
to...
to
satisfy
the
market
power
test.
and...
and
one
of
the
next
level
presumptions
that
they
propose
is
that
if
the...
if
the
patent
ties
successful
in
the
marketplace
that
shows
market
power.
but
that's
inconsistent
with
this
court's
recognition
in...
in
a
number
of
cases
that
ties
can
be
successful
in
the
marketplace
not
because
they're
backed
by
market
power,
but
because
they
are
attractive
to
consumers
in
a
competitive
market.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
my
second
point,
in
response
to
justice
breyer,
if
i
can
recall
it,
was
that
in
the
component
situation,
which
was
one
of
the
situations
that
we
were
talking
about,
that
the
problem
with
the
component
test,
the
presumptions
are
supposed
to
be
easy
to
apply.
and
if
you
say,
well,
the
entire
device
has
to
be
patented,
then
the
next
case
is
going
to
be
a
case
where
85
percent
of
the
key
ingredients
are
patented,
15
percent
aren't,
and
the
question
will
be,
does
the
presumption
apply?
so
you're...
you're
setting
up
a
presumption
which
is
designed
to...
for
ease
of
application
that
will
become
extremely
difficult
to
apply.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
the...
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it
would
be
extremely
strange
especially
because
there's
the
lack--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't
because
the...
the
economic
literature--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no.
i...
i
think,
a,
it's
not
reasonable
to
assume
that,
your
honor,
and
it's
certainly
not
reasonable
to
assume
it
has
the
level
of
market
power
that
jefferson
parish
required,
which
was
significant
market
power.
the
court
there
held
that
a
30
percent
share
of
the
relevant
market
was
not
enough.
so
we're
talking,
in
the
tying
context,
of
a
very
considerable
market
power
test.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
first
of
all,
that...
that
is
not...
is
not
true.
the
record
reflects
that
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
if
it
were
what
the
record
reflected
and
there
was
a
relevant
market
that
was...
that
was
restricted
to
this
ink,
yes.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
existence
of
a
patent,
even
in
the
requirements
context,
fulfills
that
test
for
the
reason
that
the
economic
literature
is
quite
clear
that
price
discrimination,
which
is
what
their
theory...
their...
their
theory
is
metering
should
be
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
a
presumption
because
price
discrimination
supposedly
signals
market
power.
but
as
we
discuss
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
economic
literature
that
says
that
is
in
fact
not
true,
that
price
discrimination
occurs
in
very
competitive
markets
from
airlines
to
restaurants
to
coupons.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
the
presumption
does
take
one
view
over
another
based
on...
based
on
something
that
was
adopted
at
the
time
there
was
no
analysis.
the
presumption
says
we're
going
to
presume
market
power,
and
as
justice
scalia
said,
we're
going
to
put
the
entire
burden
of
refuting
market
power,
in
this
one
context,
separate
from
all
of
antitrust
analysis,
on
the
defendant.
and
we're
only
going
to
do
it
in
tying.
we're
not
going
to
do
it
in
exclusive...
vertical
exclusive
dealing
arrangements
where
the
product
is
a
tie.
in
that
situation,
which
theoretically
should
be
exactly
the
same,
there's
never
been
a
assumption
that
there
should
be
a
market
power
presumption
when
the
product
that's
the
subject
of
the
exclusive
dealing
arrangement
is
patented.
a
territorial
arrangement.
there's
never
been
an
assertion
that
that's
true.
this...
this
is
a
relic
really
of
the
fact
that
when
the
court
decided
these
patent
tying
cases,
there
was
a
hostility
to
the
expansion
of...
of
intellectual
property
rights
beyond
the
scope
of
the
patent.
that
first
was
reflected
in
patent
misuse
doctrine,
and
then
it
was
carried
over
to
antitrust
doctrine
without
any
analysis
about
whether
the
assertion
that
the
patent
was
unique,
and
therefore
there
were
anticompetitive
effects,
had
anything
to
do
with
the
level
of
anticompetitive
effects
that
the
court
required
to
show
an
illegal
tie.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
the
short
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
antitrust
cases
that
are
filed
that
aren't
successful,
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
just
because
a
plaintiff
files
a
case,
that
it
is
going
to
be
successful.
and,
in
fact,
establishing
a
rule
that
the
filing
of
the
case
meets
an
element
is...
is
a
bit
of
an
interactive
nuisance.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
there
was--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
and
i
think
it's
an
interactive
nuisance.
if
that's
the
rule,
if
i
can
satisfy
the
rule
by
filing
a
lawsuit,
i'm
certainly
encouraged
to
file
a
lawsuit
regardless
of
whether
there's
underlying
really
market
power
or
not
because
i...
no
one
will
ever...
i
won't
have
to
worry
about
it.
the
burden
will
be
shifted
to
my
opponent.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
there
certainly
have
been
lawsuits
that
are
unsuccessful,
but...
but,
your
honor,
one
of
the
problems
with
our
litigation
system
is
many
cases
are
not
tried
to
completion
on
the
merits,
especially
expensive
antitrust
cases.
so
if
a
case--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
right
now
i
would
say
the
presumption
status
is
somewhat
murky.
when
the...
when
the
antitrust
division
in
the
ftc
came
out
with
their
guidelines
and
essentially
disavowed
and
rejected
the
recognition
of
a
presumption
and
the
sixth
circuit
also
rejected
the
existence
of
the
presumption,
there
was
a...
both
a
conflict
among
the
courts
of
appeals
and
certainly
amongst
the
district
courts.
and
also,
you
had
the
federal
regulators
saying
this
presumption
doesn't
make
sense.
that,
i
think,
chilled
to
a
large
extent...
not
completely,
but
to
some
extent...
what
would
otherwise
have
been...
what
would
have
happened
in
the
lower
courts
if
there
had
been
a
full
throated
affirmance
of
the
presumption.
and
i
think
the
issue
now
is
prognosticating
a
bit
what
will
happen
if
the
court
were
to
affirm
the
presumption.
and
i
think
it
is
a
fair
assumption
that
a
presumption
that
says
if
you
file
a
lawsuit
alleging
tying
of
a
product
that
has
a
patent
or
is
patented,
then
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
plus
the
patent
means
that
the
burden
of
market
power
has
shifted,
then
if
i'm
a
competitor
trying
to
put
some
cost
on
my
competitor
in
a
market,
that's
a
pretty
low
cost
thing
to
do
because
all
i
do
is
file
the
lawsuit.
i
get
the
benefit
of
presumption.
they've
got
to
spend
the
money
to
disprove
market
power.
and
the
market
power
element
is
peculiarly
important
in
the
tying
context
because
we're
dealing
here
with
a
per
se
rule,
although
a
somewhat
peculiar
per
se
rule
because
it
has
these
four
prerequisites.
but
the
market
power
one
is
the
critical
one
and
certainly
one
that
the
court
identified--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
there
obviously
is...
a
lot
of
commentators
have
expressed
concern
about
the...
whether
the
per
se
rule
makes
sense.
and...
and
justice
o'connor.
writing
for
four
justices
in
jefferson
parish,
made
exactly
that
point.
but
i
think
whether
or
not
the
per
se
rule
applied,
there's
no
logic
underlying
this
presumption.
and...
and
at
least
as
the
law
stands
now,
the
other
elements
are
their
two
products.
there
are
a
hundred
pages
in
areeda
and
turner--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--with
the
jurisprudence
of
two
products.
so
that's
not
a
test
that's
going
to
be
effective
in
screening
out
unjustified
claims.
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
there's
a
monopoly
in
the
tied
product?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
all
we're
asking
for
is--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--is
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
market
power,
and
if--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no.
if
there
is
a
monopoly
in
the
tying
product,
your
honor,
that's
one
of
the
elements
that
the
court
requires.
that
would
be
satisfied,
and
obviously,
the
existence
of
the
patent
would
be
a
factor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
whether
even
if
there
was
a--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
there
are
some
that
hold
that
view,
your
honor,
but
there
are
some
that
don't.
but
all
agree
that
it
is
critical
to
show
market
power
in
the
tying
product.
if
you
can't
meet
that
test,
there's
really
no
problem.
if
you
can
meet
that
test,
then
there's
a
division.
some
say
there's
a
problem
and
some
say
there's
not.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
as
we
note
in
our
reply
brief,
the...
the
document
that
was
the
basis
of
respondent's
own
damages
study
in
this
case
said
that
the
average
price
charged
by
trident
was
$85.
so
there's
no
proof
of
that.
and
the
district
court
specifically
found,
in
fact,
that
respondent
was
not
relying
on
so
called
direct
evidence
of
market
power
in
this
case,
such
as
supracompetitive
prices.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points.
with
respect
to
respondent's
last
argument
about
affirming
on
the
basis
of
direct
evidence,
that's
an
argument
that
the
district
court
found
to
have
been
waived.
on
page
30a
of
the
joint...
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
court
noted
that
the
plaintiff
prefers
no
direct
evidence
of
market
power,
such
as
supracompetitive
prices.
and
in
fact,
the
price
evidence
that
they
rely
on
here
was
not
even
cited
or
attached
to
the
summary
judgment
motions
on
the
market
power
issue.
respondent's
argument
is
a
little
peculiar.
it...
it
basically
is
because
we
can't
establish
a
procompetitive
justification
for
this
particular
tie,
the
presumption
should
be
upheld.
of
course,
the
issue
in
the
district
court
wasn't
whether
or
not
this
tie
was
procompetitive,
so
we
didn't
introduce
evidence
about
whether
or
not
the
tie
was
procompetitive.
we
introduced
evidence
about
market
power
because
the
issue
was
market
power.
i
think
respondent
is
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse
here
in
that
respect.
and
there
is
no
consensus
of
economists.
and
we
discuss
this
on
pages
11
to
13
of
our
reply
brief,
that
respondent's
syllogism
of
metering
equals
requirements
tie
equals
proof
of
market
power.
each
of
those
three
things
are
wrong.
there
are
procompetitive
justifications
for
metering.
metering
and
price
discrimination
is
not
evidence
of...
of
market
power
of
the
type
that
the
court
required
in
jefferson
parish.
it's
evidence
of
some
modicum
of
market
power,
but
not
enough
market
power

that's
very
clear
from
the
economic
literature.
and
there
are
other
justifications
that
are
advanced.
in
this
case
preservation
of
quality
was
advanced
as
a
justification.
but
that's
why
the
market
power
issue
is
so
important.
it

i'm
sorry.
we
cite
a
number
of
lower
court
decisions
granting
summary
judgment
for
defendants

the
presumption

there

a
record
here
of
this

attempts
to
misuse
this
presumption.
respondent
also
talks
about...
frames
the
presumption
as
patents
used
to
enforce
a
tie,
as
if
the
presumption
required
some
causal
connection
between
the
patent
and
the
tie.
it
doesn't.
all
the
presumption
requires
is
that
the
tying
product
be
patented.
it
doesn't
require
