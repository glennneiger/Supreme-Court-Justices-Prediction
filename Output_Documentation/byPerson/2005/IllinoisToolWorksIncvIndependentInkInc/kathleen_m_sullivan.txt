ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
petitioners
and
the
government
have
fallen
far
short
of
the...
meeting
the
burden
that
would
be
required
to
overrule
a
presumption
that
has
been
in
force
for
nearly
60
years
since
the
international
salt
decision,
a
presumption
that,
as
justice
stevens
acknowledged,
reflected
the
court's
prior
experience
dating
back
to
the
enactment
of
the
clayton
act
in
1914
with
the
use
of
patents
to
enforce
requirements
ties
like
the
one
at
issue
here,
buy
our
printhead
and
you
have
to
buy
our
ink
at
whatever
price
we
set
for
the
life
of
the
product,
even
after
the
patent
has
expired.
it
was
precisely
the
court's
experience
with
a
series
of
patent
cases
in
which
such
requirements
ties
have
been
imposed
that
led
it
to
set
forth
the
presumption
in
international
salt.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes,
it
is,
justice
o'connor.
this
is
absolutely
a
requirements
tie
case.
this
is
a
case
in
which
independent
ink
seeks
to
sell
ink
that
is
required
to
operate
trident's
printheads,
their
piezoelectric
impulse
ink
jet
printheads
used
to
put
carton
coding
directly
onto
cartons.
and
the
requirement
here...
a
requirements
tie
is
that
if
you
buy
our
good
a,
you
need
to
buy
good
b
that's
a
necessary--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--operating
it
in
perpetuity.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
breyer,
this
is
not
jerrold
electronics.
there's
no
indication
that
in
this
case
there
was
any
price
discount
given
on
the
printheads
in
order
to
make
it
up
through
a
supracompetitive
royalty
payment
extracted
from
the
end
users
by
requiring
them
to
pay
three
times
the
market
for
ink.
the
end
users
are
charged
three
times
what
independent
ink
would
sell
them
the
ink
for
directly.
and...
and
the
original
equipment
manufacturers,
the
printers
who
put
the
trident
printhead
into
the
printer
to
sell
to
the
end
users
like
general
mills
and
gallo
wines...
they're
charged
twice
the
price.
so
there
is
a
markup
on
the
ink.
this
is
a
case
in
which
a
supracompetitive
profit
is
being
extracted
as
a
kind
of
royalty
on
the
ink
sales
for
life.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
no.
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
just
remind
us
how
narrow
the
presumption
is
here.
the
presumption
here
attaches
to
one
element
in
a
tying
case.
there
are
still
other
screens.
the
other
screens...
the
plaintiff
still
bears
the
proof
of
showing
that
there
are
two
separate
products.
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
if
two
products
are
bundled
together,
if
the
tie
is
bundling
two
products
together,
there
may
well
be
a
single
product.
if
there's
a
procompetitive
reason
for
a
bundle,
that
will
be
screened
out
by
the
requirement
that
a
tie
involved
tying
product
a
to
product
b.
if
products
a
and
b
are
combined
as
components
in
a
single
product,
the
screen
of
separability
will
operate.
and--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
does
not
entail
a
heavy
burden
on
the
defendant.
what
the
presumption
does
is
simply
presume
from
a
patent
used
to
effect,
as
here,
a
requirements
tie.
and
justice
o'connor,
it's
not
just
a
component
in
the
larger
product.
the
patent
has
to
be
used
through
the
licensing
of
the
patent
to
effect
the
tie.
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
presumption
attaches
to
any
product
that
happens
to
contain
a
patent
in
the
component.
but
when
that
happens,
mr.
chief
justice,
the...
when
the
patent
is
used
through
its
license
to
exact
in
perpetuity...
you
have
to
buy
a
requirement
for
life...
it
is
quite
fair
to
ask
the
defendant
to
come
forward
and
say,
well,
that's
not
so
bad
because
there
are
reasonable
substitutes.
we
just
looked
at
them
when
we
got
our
patent
in
order
to
show
that
it
was
novel.
we
looked
at
what
the
prior
art
was,
and
we've
studied
our
competitors
and
the
printhead
market
closely--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
kennedy,
the
patent
presumption
makes
economic
sense
because,
more
likely
than
not,
a
patent
used
to
effect
a
requirements
tie
will
have
market
power.
justice
breyer
said
at
the
outset
that
a
patent
is
intended
to
confer
market
power.
that's
what
a
patent
is...
is
registered
for.
it's
intended
to
create
legally
enforceable
barriers
to
entry
that
make
it
rivals...
entrance
into
the
market
more
difficult.
that's
what
it's
intended
to
do.
it
doesn't
matter
that
95
percent--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--95
percent
of
patents
are
valueless
according
to
petitioners'
own
statistics,
but
they
won't
arise
in
a
patent
tying
case
because
if
they're
valueless,
they
won't
be
licensed.
and
if
they're
not
licensed,
they
can't
be
used
to
effect
the
tie.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
breyer,
justice
souter
asked
before
to
petitioners'
counsel,
has
there
been
any
evidence
of
frivolous
litigation,
tying
litigation,
brought
where
there
was
a
valueless
patent
to
which
a
tie
to
a
requirement
was...
was
made,
and
petitioners'
counsel
could
name
none.
the
focus
here
has
been
on
the
wrong
pool.
the
arguments
are
about
valueless
patents,
which
there's
no
evidence
they've
been
used
to
tie--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--to
try
to--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--to
make
up
the
money
through
a
requirements
tie
in
perpetuity.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
if
it
takes
off.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
breyer--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
breyer,
that
couldn't
happen
unless
there
was
market
power
in
the
patented
product.
there's
reason...
there's
no
reason
why
a
consumer
would
agree
to
pay
supracompetitive
prices
for
the
requirement--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--not
the
case
here.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
this
returns
us
to
justice
stevens'
question.
can
metering
be
procompetitive?
and
the
petitioners
and
government
have
utterly
failed
to
show
how
metering
could
be
procompetitive
in
a
requirements
tie
case.
the
briefs
of
professor
nalebuff
and
professor
scherer,
the
only
economist
briefs
submitted
in
the
case,
show
how
metering
is
not
necessarily
efficient.
even
if
it
produces...
produces
some
kind
of
gain
to
production,
it
transfers
surplus
from
consumers.
and
in
any
event,
metering...
if...
if
the
goal
here
were
to
try
to
impose
the
royalty
on
the
ink,
if
the
goal
here...
if...
if
trident
really
wanted
to
say
we
want
to
be
efficient
price
discriminators,
we're
charging
less
for
the
printhead...
and
there's
no
evidence
there
was
any
kind
of
discount
on
the
printhead
here.
this
is
not
a
penny
for
the
product.
these
are
$10,000
printheads
that
go
into
$20,000
printers
that
last
for
20
years.
so
this
is
not--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--the
discount
case.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
stevens,
we
believe
the
district
court
erred
in
holding
that
there
was
no--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--direct
evidence
of
market
power
here,
and
we
urge,
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance,
that
there's
ample
direct
evidence
of
market
power
here.
mr.
chief
justice?
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
not
typically
going
to
be
the
case.
this
is
an
unusual
case
in
that
the
direct
evidence
of
market
power
comes
from
defendants'
own
customer
surveys,
which
at
pages
393-394
of
the
joint
appendix
indicate
that
the
customers
here
were
deeply
dissatisfied
with
having
to
pay
supracompetitive
prices
for
ink
when
independent
ink
and
other
independent
providers
were
offering
them
discounted
ink
on
the
market.
the
license
here
precluded
either
the
original
equipment
manufacturers
or
the
end
users
from
buying
that
ink.
the
license
extends
to
customers
of
trident
and
to
their
end
users.
and
the
original
equipment
manufacturers
were
deeply
dissatisfied.
jefferson
parish
says
that
there's
evidence
of
market
power
when
a...
the
producer
in
the
tying
product
market
is
able
to
impose
onerous
conditions
that
it
could
not
impose
in
a
competitive
market--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
it's...
there...
there...
it
would
take
a
far
better
showing
than
the
petitioners
and
the
government
have
made
to
overturn
a
sensible
rule
of
thumb
that
makes
sense
as
a
matter
of
theory
and
makes
sense
of...
as
a
matter
of
practice.
they've
failed
to
indicate
a
single
case
in
which
there's
been
frivolous
litigation
over
a
patent
tie.
the
presumption,
if
it
was
going
to
unleash
this
wave
of
frivolous
litigation
because
the
screen
was
too
low,
you
would
think
that
they
could
name
a
single
case
over
the
last
60
years
in
which
that
occurred.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
well,
in
this
case
that
isn't
so
because
the
petitioner
initiated
the
litigation.
let
us
remember
that
this
case
began
as
a
patent
infringement
action
in
which
trident
came
after
independent
ink
for
patent
infringement
claims,
which
were
dismissed
with
prejudice
by
the
district
court,
found
to
be
unsustainable.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
to
go
back
to
the
direct
evidence
point,
you
asked
before
isn't
market
power
doing
all
the
heavy
lifting.
market
power
can
be
shown
through
expert
evidence,
and
that's
what
the
district
court
erroneously
said
that
we
had
failed
to
provide.
but
it
can
also
be
shown,
as
this
court
has
acknowledged
in
kodak,
as...
and
in
ftc
v.
indiana
dentists,
market
power
can
be
shown
directly.
if
there's
direct
evidence
of
anticompetitive
effects
in
the
tied
product
market...
here,
three
times
the
price
one
wants
to
pay
for
ink
in
order
to
use
the
patented
printhead
for
20
years
and
thereafter...
if
there's
evidence
directly
of
anticompetitive
effect
in
the
tying...
in
the
tied
product
market,
then
there's
no
need
for
that
expert
evidence.
this
happens
to
be
the
rare
case
in
which
the
petitioner
was
cooperative
enough
to
have
taken
customer
surveys
showing
the...
the
dissatisfaction
its
customers
had
over
a
long
period
of
years
with
having
to
pay
supracompetitive
prices
for
ink.
but
that
won't
be
the
general
case.
and
in
other
cases,
the
patent
rule
is
a
sensible
rule
of
thumb...
the
patent
presumption,
not
a
rule,
is
a
sensible
rule
of
thumb
for
capturing
the
wisdom
that
patents
used
to
enforce
requirements
ties
are
more
likely
than
not
to
show
market
power.
that's
what
they're
intended
to
do
through
barriers
to
entry,
and
that's
what
they
have
done.
in
fact,
the
petitioners
and
government
have
been
able...
unable
to
show
a
single
procompetitive
requirements
tie.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
there
could
be
a
sensible
argument
that
you
should
always
presume
requirements
ties
to
indicate
market
power.
that's
not
the
law,
and
we
don't
urge
it
here.
we
think
that
you
capture
the
same
point
if
you
retain
the
presumption,
as
it
was
stated
in
salt,
as
it
was
restated
again
by
this
court
in
jefferson
parish,
as...
by
the
court
in
loew's--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--do
we...
we
argue
that
the
rule
should
continue
to
be,
as
it
has
always
been,
that
when
a
patent
is
used
to
enforce
a
tie
for
a
requirement...
sorry...
when
a
patent
is
used
to
enforce
a
tie,
that's
presumptive
evidence
of
market
power.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
we...
it...
it's
not
the
law
and
we
don't
urge
it
in
any
other
context.
you
need
not
reach,
justice
o'connor,
the
question
of
copyrights
here.
they
are
not
presented.
loew's
was
a
copyright
bundling
case.
this
is
a
patent
requirements
case,
and
that's
all
that's
at
issue.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
breyer,
you
should
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
[laughter]
the
reason
is
that
we've
had
the
patent
presumption
for
60
years.
it
is
not
murky.
it
is
not
the
least
bit
murky.
congress
is
open,
willing,
and...
and
able
to
change
this
court's
rulings--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--they...
they
did
not.
they
did
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
patent
misuse
reform
act
of
1988
eliminated
a
market
power
presumption
as
a
patent
misuse
defense
to
an
infringement
action...
in...
in
a
patent
misuse
defense
to
an
infringement
action.
but
congress
declined
to
remove
the
presumption
from
the
antitrust
laws.
and
while
congressional
inaction
might
not
always
be
a
good
guide
to
what
congress
is
thinking,
here
the
senate
actually
placed
legislation
in
the...
in
the
bill
that
was
sent
to
the
house
to
remove
the
presumption
from
the
antitrust
laws
as
well,
and
the
house
took
it
out
and
the
senate
acquiesced.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
not
at--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--it's
not
inconsistent,
your
honor,
at
all
because
the
patent
misuse
context
lacks
the
other
screens
that
are
present
here,
the
other
screens
that
are
present
here
from
the
other
elements,
and
the
affirmative
defenses,
like
the
business
justification
defense
in
jerrold
electronics,
like
the
business
justification
defense
in
microsoft.
the...
the
other--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
if...
the
narrowness
of
the
presumption
here
is
we're
only
talking
about
patent
cases,
not
copyright
cases.
we're
only
talking
about
one
element
of
four.
the
plaintiffs
still
bears
the
burden
on
substantial
effect
on
commerce,
separate
products,
and
forcing.
there
is
still
affirmative
defenses
available
to
the
plaintiffs--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--no,
no,
not--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
breyer,
with
respect
to
your
concerns
about
stopping
innovation,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
presumption
of
market
power
in
a
patent
tying
case
has
had
the
slightest
adverse
effect
on
the
important
new
technological
developments
you've
described.
to
the
contrary,
patents
have
increased
exponentially
in
the
20
years
since
jefferson
parish
restated
the
presumption
of
market
power
in...
in
a
patent
case.
so
the...
the
fears
about
innovation
have...
the
burden
is
on
the
petitioners
and
the
government
to
show
that
a
60-year-old
rule,
settled
precedent
of
this
court,
in
a
statutory
case
in
which
congress
is
free
to
overrule
it
and
which
it
hasn't--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
ginsburg,
the
presumption
here
arises
in
a
very
special
statutory
context.
the
clayton
act
was
passed
in
1914
in
response
to
a
decision
of
this
court
which
congress
viewed
as
erroneously
upholding
a
patent
tie
just
like
the
one
here.
a.b.
dick
wanted
to
sell
you
its
mimeograph
machine
only
if
you
bought
its
fluid
and
stencil
paper
in
perpetuity
from
a.b.
dick.
it
was
congress'
dissatisfaction
with
permitting
such
a...
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
such
a
patent
requirements
tie
that
led
to
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act.
and
so
the
presumption
of
stare
decisis
with
respect
to
this
court's
rules
to
effectuate
the
anti
tying
goals
of
the
clayton
act
is...
should
be
accorded
more
weight
than
just
ordinary
common
law--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--it
does.
it
does,
indeed,
justice
stevens.
it
eliminated
a
patent
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws.
but
we're
not
suggesting
that
patented
and
unpatented
products
are...
are
different
with
respect
to
the
showing
of
market
power.
both
have
to
be
shown
to
have
market
power
when
they're
used
to
effect
a
tie.
we're
simply
arguing
that
when
the...
when
a
patent
is
used
to
force
the
tie,
it
makes
sense...
it
makes
good
economic
sense
today,
as
it
did
in
1914,
and
in
all
the
cases
that
led
up
to
international
salt...
to
assume
that
it's
only
through
market
power
that
the
patent
is
able
to
effect...
effectuate
the

patents
are
intended
to
confer
market
power.
they
do
in
a
small
set
of
cases.
professor
scherer,
whose
amicus
brief
supports
the
presumption,
has
demonstrated
that
there's
an
innovation
lottery
in
which
only
some
patents
are
successful,
but
those
that
are
successful
are
highly
successful,
highly
valuable.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
scalia,
the...
the
economic
theories
that
focus
on
the
relevant
pool,
which
is
patents
that
have
sufficiently
high
value
to
be
used
to
enforce
a
tie,
is
unanimously
on
our
side
so
that
there's
no
procompetitive
value,
that
there
are
anticompetitive
effects.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
the...
they're
focusing
on
the
wrong
pool.
petitioners
and
the
government
have
cited
a
number
of
economists
who
talk
about
price
discrimination
in
the
abstract.
we're
not
talking
here
about
senior
citizen
discounts
at
the
movies.
we're
talking
about
price
discrimination
with
respect
to
a
tying
market,
in
which,
by
the
way,
the
dangers
of
shrouding
information
to
the
consumer
are
demonstrated
by
this
case.
the...
the
petitioners--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--but
the--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--it--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--most...
the
majority
view
is
that
price
discrimination
does
reflect
market
power,
that
you
can't
discriminate
without
it,
and
that's
reflected
in
judge
posner's
recent
decisions,
for
example.
so
if
they're...
if
they're
using
metering
here
to
price
discriminate,
all
the
more
reason
for
you
to
uphold
the
presumption
here
because
the
metering
is
being
used
to
price
discriminate
the
very
thing
that
shows
there's
market
power.
but
if...
to
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
point
about
whether
metering
can
ever
be
a
good
way
for
the
monopolist
to
take
his
profit
on
the
ink,
rather
than
on
the
printhead,
there's
very
good
reason
to
think
it's
bad,
inefficient,
and
certainly
bad
for
consumers
for
the
monopolist
to
take
his
profit
on
the
ink
rather
than
on
the
printhead
because
the
consumer
can't
make,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
eastman
kodak,
a
good
judgment
at
the
beginning
of
how
much
ink
he's
going
to
need
for
the
life
of
the
product
and
what
it's
going
to
cost.
and
in
this
case,
petitioners
did
everything
possible
to
keep
its...
its
customers
from
knowing
what
the
ink
would
cost
over
its
lifetime.
on
page
396
of
the
appendix,
you'll
see
the
customers
complaining
in
petitioners'
own
survey
that
they
couldn't
get
the
ink
consumption
rates
out
of
trident.
this
is
a
case
in
which,
if
you
shroud
to
the
consumer
the
true
life
cycle
cost
of
using
the
printhead
with
the
ink
need...
needed
to
run
it,
you're
going
to
create
lots
of
inefficiencies
in
the
market.
you're
going
to
create,
first
of
all,
the
inefficiencies
of
enforcing
the
tie.
you're
going
to
create
the
inefficiencies
and
social
costs
of
creating
alternative
routes
when
the
customers
seek
to
go
elsewhere.
think
of
chop
shops
for
auto
parts.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
well,
we
would
argue
that
the
presumption
makes
sense
no
matter
whether
the
patentee
is
a
big
or
a
small
company,
and
the
reason
is,
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
that
the...
the
patentee
will
always
have
better
information
about
the
market
for
the
tying
product.
here,
trident
is
the
expert
in
printheads.
independent
ink,
the
plaintiff,
doesn't
know
about
printheads.
it
knows
about
ink.
for
independent
ink
to
try
to
show
that
there
are
no
reasonable
substitutes
for
the
printhead
is
a
very
arduous
burden
to
place
on
independent
ink,
whereas
it's
a
very
sensible
burden
to
place
on
the
defendant
to
say,
show
us
that
there
are
reasonable,
noninfringing
substitutes
for
your
printhead.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
scalia,
we
argue
simply
that
it's
fair
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
defendant.
remember,
this
is
a
narrow
presumption.
it's
not
a
per
se
invalidity
rule.
it's
just
a
rebuttable
presumption.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
it
is
harder
for
us
to
find
out
what
new
competitors
have
come
into
the
tying
product
market
in
the
meantime,
and
it
is
easier
for
defendants
to
prove
the
affirmative,
that
there
is
a
reasonable
substitute.
of
course,
in
their
own
promotions
and
advertising,
they
said
that
nothing
else
is
as
good
as
their
printer.
but
it's
reasonable
to
ask
them
to
prove
that
there
is
a
reasonable
substitute.
it's
far
harder
to
ask
the
plaintiff
to
prove
that
there's
no
reasonable
substitute
because
we
don't
have
access
to
the
information
about
their
competitors
that
they
could
be
expected
to
keep
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
business
records.
but,
justice
ginsburg,
to
return
to
your
point,
if
there's
any
doubt
about
whether
metering
can
ever
be
efficient,
if
there's
any
doubt
about
whether
there
could
be
a
procompetitive
reason
for
a
requirements
tie,
evidence
that
has
utterly
been
failed
to
be
presented
here,
where
there's
no
economist
brief
on
their
side
and
several
economist
briefs
on
our
side
by
very
distinguished
economists
cited
by
the
other
side,
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that
kind
of
economic
wisdom,
then
indeed
it
should
be
decided
by
congress.
it's
a
matter
of
economic
policy
to
be
decided
by
congress.
congress
has
not
only
failed
to
reform
the
antitrust
laws
in
1988,
when
it
looked
at
a
bill
that
the
senate
had
written
and
the
house
rejected
it,
it's
failed
five
times
since
then
to
reject
this
presumption.
so
there's
nothing
murky
about
the
presumption.
it's
still
the
law.
if
petitioners
really
petitioners
really
believe
they
can
come
forward
with
an
economic
record
they
haven't
come
forward
with
so
far,
congress
is
open
and
able
to
correct
it.
but
when
this
court
has
guided
plaintiffs
and
defendants
for
60
years
with
a
presumption
that
still
makes
good
economic
sense...
and
justice
stevens,
if
there
were
anything
to
the
metering
argument,
why
wouldn't
trident
simply
put
a
counting
chip
in
the
printhead
and
say
we're
going
to
charge
you
a
per
use
fee?
every
time
you
put
a
bar
code
on
a
carton,
you
pay
us
a
royalty.
that
would
be
the
way
to
have
metering
and
to
capture
the
monopoly
profit
through
the
ink
market
without
all
the
inefficiencies
that
come
with
tying
the...
the
sales
of
ink,
keeping
other
rivals
out
of
the
ink
market--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
stevens,
that's
correct.
had...
had
that
technology
existed
in
1984,
maybe
jefferson
parish
might
have
mentioned
it.
but
it's
certainly
the
case
that
today
there's
no
reason
for...
to
get
the
efficiency
gains
from
metering
through
tying
arrangements.
tying
arrangements
are
a
very
inefficient
way
of
getting
the
efficiency
gains
from
metering
when
there
is
this
completely
transparent
alternative.
trident
might
not
want
to
tell
people
what
it's
really
costing
them
to
put
a
bar
code
on
a
carton
because
if
you
tell
the
consumer,
they
might
defect.
but
it...
the...
the
metering
argument
is
satisfied
by
a
transparent
use
of
counting
technology
today.
so
there's
no
procompetitive
reason
here.
this
is
not
a
bundle.
this
is
not
a
case
where,
as
the
concurring
opinion
in
jefferson
parish
suggested,
there
might
be
very
sensible
ways
to
see
efficiencies
in
a
bundle
where
i
buy
two
products
at
the
same
time,
an
air...
a
car
that
comes
with
tires
and
an
air
conditioner.
but
it's
quite
a
different
matter
because
the
cost
savings
from
that
accrue
to
the
consumer.
there
are
efficiencies
that
can
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer
by
bundling
two
products
that
can
be
simultaneously
purchased
and
consumed
together.
but
this
is
a
requirements
tie
case.
there's
no
efficiency
that's
been
demonstrated
in
selling
the
car
but
requiring
you
to
buy
gasoline
from
the
car
manufacturer
for
the
rest
of
the
life
of
the
car,
long
after
any
patents
exist.
and
in
the
absence
of
that
kind
of
evidence,
there's
no
reason
to
overrule
a
sensible
rule
that
does
not
just
date
to
loew's,
as
mr.
hungar
incorrectly
suggested.
it
dates
back
to
salt,
to
1947
for
arguments
in
our...
we've
argued
in
our
brief
that
salt
had
to
depend
on
the
presumption.
and
the
court
was...
with
respect
to
the
petitioners'
argument
that
the
court
didn't
know
what
it
was
doing
when
it
decided
those
cases,
we
respectfully
disagree.
the
court
was
well
aware,
as
it
indicated
2
years
later
in
standard
stations
that
there
might
be
some
substitutes
for
a
patented
product,
and
it
reaffirmed
the...
the
presumption
anyway.
the
presumption
makes
good
economic
sense.
it
makes
good
litigation
sense.
and...
and
as
an
alternative
to
the
argument
that
you
should
affirm
the
federal
circuit
on
the
presumption,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
there's...
there
was
direct
evidence
of
market
power
here,
the
supracompetitive
prices
charged
on
ink
to
both
the
original
equipment
manufacturers
and
the
end
users,
the
customer
dissatisfaction
displayed
in
the
petitioners'
own
customer
surveys
in
the
joint
appendix
at
393.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
the
unusual
case.
it
won't
be
every
case
in
which
a
defendant
is
so
imprudent
as
to
create
a...
a
record
of
its
own
anticompetitive
effects
on
its
tying...
on
its
tied
product
requirements
market.
and
in
the
other
cases,
it
would
be
a...
there's
danger,
justice
breyer,
that...
there's
been
no
harm
to
innovation
shown
here.
the
presumption
has
been
in
effect
for
60
years,
but
there
could
be
grave
danger
to
this
court
lifting
it.
there
may
be
many
meritorious
anticompetition
cases
screened
out
by
that
rule.
so
we
respectfully
urge
you
affirm
the
federal
circuit.
thank
you.
