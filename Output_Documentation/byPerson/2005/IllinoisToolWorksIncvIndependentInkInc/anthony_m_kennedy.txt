anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose...
i
suppose
we
could
say...
i
just
hadn't
thought
of
it.
i...
i
suppose
we...
we
could
say
that
it's
not
a
separate
product.
i
mean,
no...
no...
there's
no
market
for
the...
for
the
small
micro
component
in
the
tv.
you're
selling
a
tv.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
an...
a
very
interesting
question,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
could
handle
that
by
just
saying,
well,
there's
not
a
separate
product.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
the
existence
of
the
loss
of...
of...
the
existence
of
the
lawsuit...
of...
of
the
presumption
is
what
drives
the
lawsuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
that
the...
the
chief...
chief
justice's
question...
and
it...
it's
the
same
question
as
justice
souter
had
and
is
what
concerns
me.
my...
my
understanding...
and
it's
not
an
understanding
based
on
any
experience
litigating
in
this
area...
is
that
when
you
hire
economists,
in
order
to
establish
market
power,
this
is
a
substantial
undertaking.
it's...
it's
a
significant
part
of
litigation
costs.
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
is
an
important
rule
so
that
we...
we
vindicate
the
important
rule
by
putting
the
presumption
on...
on
the
defendant.
but
you
can
say
that
with
many
important
rules
in
many
other
areas.
