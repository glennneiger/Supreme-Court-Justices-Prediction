mr.
pincus,
you...
you
had
a
second
point
you
were
going...
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question.
what
was
your
second
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
the
refutation
of
the
presumption
really
the
same
thing
as
a
demonstration
of
market
power?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
we
usually
leave
the
demonstration
of
market
power
to
the...
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it...
it'd
be
rather
strange
to...
to
have
in
this
one
category
of
cases
the
market
power
has
to
be...
or
lack
of
market
power
has
to
be
demonstrated
by
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
more
often
than
not,
it
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the...
the
only
issue
is
who
has
to
prove
that.
i
mean,
you...
you
could
find
out
who
their
customers
are
in...
in
discovery
and...
and
go
to
their
customers
and
then,
you
know,
show
that
all
of
the
customers
are
dissatisfied
and
wouldn't
buy...
wouldn't
buy
the
machine...
wouldn't
buy
the
ink
were
it
not
that
they
needed
the
machine.
i
mean,
it's
just
a
question
of...
of
who
has
to
prove
it.
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know
how
many
people
paid...
paid
off
the
plaintiff.
we...
you
know,
frivolous
litigation
becomes
evident
only
when
it
proceeds
far
enough
that
it's...
it's
reported.
what...
what
i
assume
would
happen
most
often
is
that
the...
the
person
who
has
the
patent
would
just
say
it's
just
not
worth
the
litigation.
here.
go
away.
we
don't
know
how
much
of
that
there
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
even
sure,
are
we,
ms.
sullivan,
that...
that
you
can
extend,
assuming
that
there
is
market
power
in
the
patent...
we're
not
really
sure
that
you
can
extend
it
through
tying.
i
mean,
there's...
there's
dispute
among
the
economists
even
on
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
probably
say
that
in
every...
in...
in
every
antitrust
case
where...
where
the
defendant
is...
is
alleging
a...
a
monopoly
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff.
it's
almost
always
the
case
that
the
plaintiff
knows...
knows
more
about
his
business
than
the
defendant
does.
it's
not
distinctive
here,
it
seems
to
me.
