mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
presumption
that
patents
confer
market
power
is
counter
factual,
inconsistent
with
this
court's
modern
antitrust
jurisprudence,
out
of
step
with
congressional
action
in
the
patent
area,
contrary
to
the
views
of
leading
antitrust
commentators
and
the
federal
antitrust
enforcement
agencies,
and
unnecessarily
harmful
to
intellectual
property
rights
and
procompetitive
conduct.
for
all
those
reasons,
the
presumption
should
be
rejected.
there's
no
plausible
economic
basis
for
inferring
market
power
from
the
mere
fact
that
a
defendant
has
a
patent
on
a
tying
product.
as
this
court
has
recognized,
many
commercially
viable
products
are
the
subject
of
patents
that
do
not
confer
market
power
because
there
are
reasonable
substitutes.
nor
does
the
combination
of
a
tie
in
a
patent
provide
a
valid
basis
for
presuming
market
power.
the
patent
may
be
entirely
incidental
and
tying
is
ubiquitous
in
fully
competitive
markets.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
strictly
speaking,
it's
not,
your
honor,
because
of
course,
this
is
a
patent
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
and
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
actually
applied
a
presumption
of
economic
power
is
the
loew's
case,
which
was
a
copyright
case.
in
fairness,
however,
loew's
based
the
presumption
that
it
recognized
in
the
copyright
context
entirely
on
the
reasoning
of
the
patent
misuse
cases.
so
a...
a
holding
that
there
is
no
presumption
in
the
patent
context
would
eviscerate
the
underlying
rationale
for
loew's.
indeed,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
congress
in
our
view
has
already
done
that
because,
again,
loew's
expressly
states
that
the
rationale
for
the
presumption
it
adopts
is
that
in
the
patent
misuse
cases,
the
court
has...
at
that
time,
had
rejected
any
attempt
to
extend
the
monopoly.
but
congress,
in
1988
in
the
patent
misuse
reform
act,
overruled
those
cases
and
held
that
there
cannot
be
patent
misuse
in
the
absence
of
an
actual
showing,
based
on
all
the
circumstances,
of
market
power.
so
the
rationale
and
underpinnings
of
loew's
have
been
entirely
repudiated,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
this
court
ought
to
make
it
clear
that
there
is
no
presumption
of
market
power
in
a
tying
case
where
there--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--as
this
court
defined
market
power--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
yes.
the
ability
to
raise
price--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor.
certainly
many
patents
are
valueless,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
why--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
that's...
that's
part
but
not
all.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
patents
can
be
valuable,
but
not
confer
meaningful,
significant
market
power.
what
this
court
said
in
jefferson
parish
is
significant
market
power.
i
mean,
there
can
be
lots
of
circumstances
in
which
a
competitor
has
the
ability
for
some
customers
in
some
circumstances
to
raise
price
to
some
extent,
but
we
wouldn't
consider
that
significant
market
power.
and
patents
can
confer
value
in
other
ways.
for
instance,
in
many
high
tech
industries
in
the
modern
high
tech
environment,
a
patent
library
is
necessary
merely
in
order
to
get
cross
licenses
from
your
competitors
that
would
allow
each
of
you
to
compete.
they're
fully
competitive
markets,
but
without
a
patent
library,
you
can't
get
in
the
door.
and
all
the
competitors
have
their
patent
libraries
and
they
agree
to
cross
licenses
to
avoid
the...
the
inconvenience
and
cost
of
patent
infringement.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that's
wrong
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
the
presumption
recognized
in
loew's,
of
course,
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
requirements
tie.
so,
in
effect,
what
that
brief
is
urging
the
court
to
do
is
not
to
retain
the
loew's
presumption
but,
rather,
to
create
a
new
one.
and
there
is
certainly
not
the
requisite
evidentiary
basis
or
consensus
among--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
your
honor,
those...
those
cases
don't
state
a
presumption
of
market
power.
market
power
wasn't
even
relevant
in
those
days.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it
is
a
brand
new
idea
in
the
sense
that
they
would...
they
would
ask
the
court
to
adopt
a
presumption
of
market
power,
which
the
court
did
not
recognize
in
the
ibm
case
or
any
of
those
cases
because
market
power
was
not
a
part
of
the
analysis
in
those
cases.
it
wasn't
relevant.
it
wasn't
relevant
in
the...
even
in
the
international
salt
case
where
the
court...
where
the
court
later
made
clear
that
the...
the
ability
to
prove
the
absence
of
market
power
was
deemed
irrelevant
by
the
court
in
international
salt.
market
power's
relevance
didn't
even
begin
to
be
recognized--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
an
increase
in
price
is
a
separate
issue
which
might
or
might
not,
depending
on
the
circumstances,
be
probative
of
market
power
in
the...
in
the
tied
product
market
or,
again,
depending
on
the
circumstances,
it
might
be
probative
of
market
power
in
the
tying
market
and
certainly
a
plaintiff
would
be
able
to
rely
on
such
evidence
if
they
could
establish
it.
but
the...
the
fact
of
a
requirements
tie,
standing
alone
together
with
a
patent,
is
not
meaningfully
probative
of
market
power
because
his
thesis
is
that
the
requirements
tie
is
always
used
for
metering,
and
metering
is
evidence
of
price
discrimination,
and
price
discrimination
is
evidence
of
market
power.
but
again,
there's
a
great
deal
of
disagreement
and,
indeed,
the
majority
view
is
that
price
discrimination
is
not
necessarily
or
even
usually
evidence
of
market
power.
in
fact,
price
discrimination
is
common
in
entirely
competitive
markets
such
as
grocery
retailing,
airline
industry,
and
many
other
contexts.
so...
so
the...
the
logic
of
the...
of
the
presumption
he
urges
doesn't
even
hold
together,
and
certainly
there
isn't
the
relevant...
the
requisite
consensus
that
would
justify
the
fashioning
of
a
new
presumption
that
has
never
been
recognized
by
the
court
before.
the
loew's--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--certainly
we
have
not
asked
the
court
to...
to
do
that,
and
that's
not
necessary
to
address
in
this
case.
the...
they're
really
two
separate
issues.
that
is,
is
it...
is
it
rationale
to
presume
market
power
from
the
existence
of
a
patent
is
quite
separate
and
distinct
in
our
view
from
the
question
whether
it's
rationale
to
have
a
per
se
tying
rule
when
there
is
market
power.
they're
completely
distinct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
justice
o'connor
made
persuasive
points
in
her
concurring
opinion
in
jefferson
parish
in
which
she
explained
why,
in
the
view
of
those
justices,
that
the
per
se
rule
does
not
make
a
whole
lot
of
economic
sense.
we
have
not
taken
a
position
on
that
question
in
this
case
because,
in
our
view,
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
that
in
order
to
reverse
the
judgment
below
which...
which
rests
entirely
on
the
presumption.
the
loew's
presumption
is
also,
in
our
view,
undermined
by
this
court's
modern
antitrust
cases,
such
as
jefferson
parish
and
eastman
kodak,
because
the
presumption...
the
fact
that
the
loew's
presumption
recognizes
is
not
market
power
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
term,
as
it
is
understood
and
required
under
eastman
kodak
and
jefferson
parish.
rather,
what
the
loew's
court
said
is
that
uniqueness
suffices
to
establish
the
requisite
economic
power
regardless
of
the
ability
to
control
price.
the
court
specifically
said
on
page
45
of
the
decision
that...
that
ability
to
control
price
need
not
be
shown.
that's
a
different
fact
that...
that
is
being
presumed
in
loew's
than
the
fact
that
is
now
required
as
part
of
the
court's
modern
per
se
tying
jurisprudence,
which
is
actual,
significant
market
power.
so
even
if
the
loew's
presumption
had
any
continuing
force,
which
we
don't
think
it
does,
it
doesn't
presume
the
relevant
fact
under
this
court's
modern
cases.
so
for
that
reason
as
well,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
incorrect.
as
has
been
discussed,
we
think
that
the
presumption
is
not
only
wrong
but
has
deleterious
consequences.
it
essentially
imposes
a
litigation
tax
on
the
ownership
of
intellectual
property
and...
and--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
as
justice
o'connor
explained
in
her
jefferson
parish
concurrence,
there's
significant
force
to
that
argument.
but...
but
again,
it's
not
presented
here
because
there's--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i
think,
as
i
said,
those
are
completely
separate
and...
and
really,
i
would
say,
unrelated
points
because
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
whether...
whether
market
power
is
relevant,
but
rather,
whether
the
plaintiff
should
be
required
to
prove
an
element
of
its
case,
which
is
the
normal
rule
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
apply
in...
in
the
whole
array
of
contexts,
including
in
antitrust
cases
in
every
other
context.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
your
honor.
