justice
ruth
bader

--as
i
understand
the
respondent's
position,
it's
not
the
component.
they're
not
arguing
that.
so
you're
answering
a
hypothetical
case
that
isn't
presented
here.
and
also,
respondent
says
that
we
are
talking
only
about
patents
where
there
is
a
successful
tie.
so
leave
out
all
those
cases
where
i
have
a
patent
and
it's
never
produced
a
penny,
and
somehow
i
can
make
mileage
out
of
that.

there
was
a...
a
point
that
you
were
in
the
process
of
answering.
the...
the
argument
is
made
that
this
tying
product
has
such
clout
that
you
were
able
to
extract
not
twice
but
three
times
the
price
for
the
tied
product.
and
you
were
saying
no
to
even
double
the
price.
justice

but
why
can
congress--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
just
ask
your
point
on
that?
you
are
giving...
your
main
argument
is
there
are
good
reasons
to
retain
this
presumption.
but
then
you
said
even
if
there
aren't,
leave
it
to
congress.
the
court
created
this
rule,
the
market
power
rule,
not
congress.
why,
when
we're
dealing
with
a
court
created
rule,
should
we
say,
well,
the
court
has
had
it
in
play
for
60
years,
so
it's
the
legislature's
job
to
fix
it
up,
instead
of
the
court
correcting
its
own
erroneous
way?
