justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
go
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
pincus,
let
me
go...
ask
you
to
follow
up
on
that
and,
in
effect,
go
back
to...
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
i
will
assume
that
patents
as
such
do
not
give
market
power.
i
will
assume
that
there
are
many
successful
ties
in
which
that
is
also
not
true.
what
is...
is
your
kind
of
short
answer
to
the...
to
the
argument,
which
i
think
justice
ginsburg
was
getting
to,
that
if
it
is,
in
fact,
worth
litigating
in
an
antitrust
case,
that
is
a
pretty
good...
darned
good
reason
to
assume
that
there
is
market
power
and
that
it
is,
of
course,
having
a
discriminatory
price
effect?
what's
the
short
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
going
to
say
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
would
have
thought
the
answer
was
you
could
say
that
in
any
case
in
which
an
antitrust
case
is...
is
brought.
so
essentially
it...
it
gets
to
be
reductionist.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
the
fact--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
does
it
drive
the...
i
mean,
it...
it
drives
the
lawsuit
with
respect
to
one
element.
and...
and
i...
i
guess
one
argument
is
if...
if
we
reaffirm
the
rule
that
you're
challenging,
it
will
invite
more
lawsuits.
they'll
say,
boy,
the
supreme
court
really
means
it
with
this
presumption
now.
has
that,
in
fact,
been
the
case
that
the
presumption,
at
least
as
it
has
been
understood
up
to
this
point,
has
driven
lawsuits
and,
in
fact,
has
driven
lawsuits
that
ultimately
were
unsuccessful
even
though
the
market
power
point
was,
of
course,
satisfied?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
this
is...
this
is
basically
a
practical
question,
and
i...
i'm
trying
to
get
a...
i
guess
because
i'm
not
an
antitrust
lawyer,
i'm
trying
to
get
a
handle
on
how
the
presumption
is
actually
working
in
the
system,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it's
a
success,
we'll
all
be
rich.
now,
he
decides
to
tie
something
to
that.
