justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
would
the
person
want
if
he
thought
that?
i
mean,
why
would
a
person
want
a
patent
if,
in
fact,
he
didn't
think
that
it
gave
him
the
power
to
raise
price
above
what
the
price
would
be
in
its
absence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
see,
you're
talking
about
the
wide...
you...
you
say
there
are
a
lot
of
failed
patents.
the
person
got
it
because
he
thought
it
would,
but
he
shouldn't
have
because
it
actually
made
no
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
might
be.
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
might
be.
there's
a
set
of
valueless
patents.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
respect
to
there
being
a
valueless
patent,
the
owner
would
not
be
able
to
raise
the
price
over
what
it
otherwise
would
be.
and
why
not
then
make
that
a
defense,
that
a
person
could
say,
i
have
a
valueless
patent,
and
he
could
introduce
evidence
to
prove
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it's
the
other
one
that's
the
critical
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
other
one
being
that...
the
attack
on
the
problem
is
there
happens
to
be
instances
where
tying
is
justified
for
procompetitive
reasons,
risk
sharing,
maintaining
product
quality,
probably
jerrold
electronics.
there
are
a
number
of
them.
and
the
real
problem
is
that
the
law
hasn't
admitted
a
defense.
but
where
the
attack
should
be
is
on
the
tied
product,
not
the
tying
product.
what
do
you
think
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
market
power...
you
mean
price...
ability
to
charge
a
price
higher
than
otherwise
would
be
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
you're
defining
it.
as
you're
defining.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
then
you're
talking
about
patents
where
the
person
who
paid
for
the
attorney
went
to
the
patent
office
and
so
forth.
that
was
just
a
mistake.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
are
you
relying
on
that,
the
existence
of
valueless
patents?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
going
beyond
that,
which
patents
are
you
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that,
i
would
think,
would
be
one
of
the
strongest
cases
for
not
having
a
per
se
rule
because
if,
in
fact,
you
have
a
justification,
in
terms
of
sharing
risk
with
a
new
product,
that
would
be
one
of
the
cases
where
you
would
expect
to
find
a
tie.
and...
and
so
i'm
not
really
very
persuaded
by
the
effort
to
draw
a
wedge
between
requirements
and
other
things.
but
what
i
do
find
very
difficult
about
this
case
is...
you
can
see
from
what
i'm
saying...
that
at
the
bottom,
i
think
there
are
cases
where
tying
is
justified.
but
the
way
to
attack
that
would
be
to
say
here,
here,
and
here
it's
justified
and
that
would
have
to
do
with
the
tied
product.
it
would
abolish
the
per
se
rule,
making
it
into
a
semi
per
se
rule.
but
here,
we're
attacking
a
different
thing.
we're
attacking
the
screen,
which
is
a...
the
tying
product.
now
there,
that's
just
a
screen.
and...
and
so
i'm...
i'm
not
certain
whether
attacking
the
screen
and
insisting
on
a
higher
standard
of
proof
is
better
than
nothing
or
whether
you
should
say,
well,
leave
the
screen
alone
and
let's
deal
with
the
tied
product
on
the
merits.
that
i
think
is
what
justice
stevens
was
getting
at
too.
and...
and
i'm...
i'm
not
being
too
clear.
you
understand
where
i'm
coming
from,
and
i...
i
want
you
to
say
what
you
want
about
that.
but
that's
what's
bothering
me
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
this
case
isn't
what's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
isn't
so.
i
mean,
you
could
have
a
patent
that
was
valueless
or
didn't
itself
confer
very
much,
but
the
person
is
trying
to
establish
the
market
for
the
product.
it's
a
component,
and
he
attaches
this
tied
product
as
a
counting
device
knowing
that
if
it's
successful,
everybody
makes
money,
and
if
it's
not
successful,
he
and
everybody
else
lose.
that's...
that's
the
kind
of
justification.
and
that
could
happen
with--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let
me
be
more
specific.
a
person
has
a
patent
on
an
item
in
a
machine.
this
is
a
great
machine.
it's
fabulous.
we've
all
had
friends
who
have
tried
to
get
us
to
invest
in
such
machines.
we
don't
know
what
it
does,
nor
does
anyone.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
tie
something
to
the
great
machine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct,
if
it
takes
off.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
takes
off,
everybody
will
be
rich,
and
if
it
doesn't
take
off,
who
cares.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
could
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
often
does,
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
put
this
machine
in
your
store
for
a
penny.
a
penny.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
the
way,
a
penny
and
you
have
to
buy
marvelous
component.
and
by
the
way,
if
it
takes
off,
you'll
buy
a
lot
of
marvelous
component,
and
if
not,
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
try
this
again,
and
i'm
thinking
of
a
way
of
saying
this
more
clearly.
this
is
my
actual
dilemma.
if
i
decide
this
case
against
you
in
my
view...
and
suppose
it
came
out
that
way...
i
would
be
concerned
lest
there
be
a
lot
of
big
companies
in
the
technology
area
that
have
real
market
power
in
tying
products
and
get
people...
and
they
extend
that
power
through
a
tie
into
a
second
market
and
thereby
insulate
themselves
from
attack.
i
would
be
afraid
of
that
really
happening,
and
everything
gets
mixed
up
in
a
war
of
experts
in
a
technology
area
about
do
we
have
the
power,
don't
we
have
the
power,
who
knows.
if
i
decide
this
case
in
your
favor,
i
would
then
be
afraid
that
particularly
in
the
patent
area,
there
will
be
lots
of
instances
where
new
technology,
uncertain
technology,
uncertain
new
technology,
does
not
get
off
the
ground
because
a
very
easy
way
to
finance
the
risk
through
a
requirements
contract,
for
example,
so
that
we
make
the
money
if
the
product
succeeds,
because
people
buy
the
required
product
at
a
higher
price.
that
will
never
happen.
and
patents
is
an
area
where
new
technology
is
particularly
at
risk.
so
i
see
a
problem
both
ways,
and
i'm
really
not
certain
what
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
once
you
start
that,
then
you're
saying
that...
which
i
thought
was
the...
i
would
have
agreed
with
the
dissent...
the
concurrence
in...
in
jefferson
parish,
but
that's
not
the
law.
and
so
now
what
you're
saying
is,
well,
we
have
to
go
and
really
make
that
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
going
to
give
me...
if
you're
going...
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
no...
i
thought
we
were
just
talking
about
several.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
price
discrimination,
i
gather,
sometimes
good,
sometimes
not.
if
it
pushes
out
sales--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
the
low
side,
it's
good.
if
it
just
extracts
profits
on
the
high
side,
it's
bad.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
i
think
most
economists...
in
fact,
everyone
i've
ever
read
agrees
with
that.
