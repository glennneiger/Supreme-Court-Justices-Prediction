g.
roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
first
in
illinois
tool
works
inc.
v.
independent
ink,
inc.--
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
mr.
hungar,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
government
have...
i'd
like
to
ask
you
the
same
question
justice
stevens
asked
mr.
pincus
about
the
broader
question.
much
of
the
economic
literature
on
which
you
rely
sort
of
sweeps
aside
the
particular
question
today
because
it
rejects
the
notion
of
tying
as
a
problem
in
the
first
place.
but
does
the
government
have
a
position
on
that?
assuming
there's
monopoly
power
in
the
tying
product,
the
government's
position
is
that
that
still
presents
an
antitrust
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
this
is
not
part
of
a
broader
approach
to
get
rid
of
the
tying
issue
altogether,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and...
and
what
is
the
government's
position
on
the
latter
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
ms.
sullivan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
this
in...
as
a
practical
matter,
this
screen
is
really
the
heavy
lifting
in
the
antitrust
cases.
this
is
where
you
need
all
the
economic
studies,
you
have
a
discovery,
the
experts.
this
is
what
costs
a
lot
of
money
and
shifts
a
lot
of
the
litigation
burden
on
the
other
side
if
you
have
a
presumption.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
your...
if
your
arguments
are
right,
isn't
that
going
to
typically
be
the
case?
in
which
case,
why
do
you
need
a
presumption
at
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
conceding
that
the
presumption
makes
no
sense
outside
of
the
requirements
metering
context?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
didn't
they
do
that?
didn't
they
do
that
in
the
patent
misuse
reform
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
isn't
it
logically
inconsistent
for
congress--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
say
that
a
patent
is
insufficient
evidence
of
market
power
in
the
misuse
context
and
then
just
turn
around
and
say,
but
if
you're
having
a
straight
lawsuit
under
antitrust,
it
is
sufficient
as
a
presumption?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
gets
back
to
how
important
you
think
and
how...
whether
it's
true
or
not
that
the
market
power
is
the
heavy
lifting,
as
far
as
all
these
screens
go.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
isn't...
it's
in
fact
easier
for
you
here.
you
can
go
down
to
the
patent
office
and
see
what
they've
distinguished
as...
the
sense
in
which
their
product
is
an
innovation
and
why
it's
not
just
like
the
other
products
that
might
be
available
that
you
could
use.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
sullivan.
mr.
pincus,
you
have
2-and-a-half
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
in
04-1329,
illinois
tool
works
versus
independent
ink.
