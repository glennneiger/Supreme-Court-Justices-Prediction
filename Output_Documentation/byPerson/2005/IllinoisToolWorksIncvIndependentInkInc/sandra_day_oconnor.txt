let
me
ask
you
about
patents
and
tying
products.
are
there
component
parts
that
are
patented
in
today's
complicated
world,
and
do
they...
do
they...
do
the
component
parts
become
part
of
the
tying
product?
i
mean,
how
does
that
work?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
patent
somehow
spread
to
cover
the
larger
product?
i...
i
don't
see
how
it
works.
justice
sandra

mr.
hungar,
is
the
issue
of
the
presumption,
as
it
applies
to
copyright,
part
of
the
question
presented?
and
do
we
have
to
decide
that
issue
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hungar,
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
for
the
respondent
was
submitted
by
a
professor,
i
think,
named
barry
nalebuff--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--which
took
the
view
that
the
court
should,
in
any
event,
retain
the
presumption
where
a
patent
is
being
used
to
impose
a
variable
or
a
requirements
tie.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
that
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
isn't
a
requirements
tie
case,
is
it?
