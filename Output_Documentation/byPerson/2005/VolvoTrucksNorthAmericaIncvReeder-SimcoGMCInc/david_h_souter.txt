yes,
but
there
would
be
sales
if
they
were
selling
from
inventory.
i
mean,
there
would
have
been
a
preceding
sale,
and
the
sale
would
have
been
at
differential
prices,
as
between
two
dealers.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
you're
looking
at--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
you're
looking
at
broad
market
competition,
you
don't
normally
require
them
to
identify
competition
on
a
customer...
on
a
per
customer
basis.
the
only
reason
we
get
into
the
per
customer
basis
is
that
we
have
this
odd...
not
an
odd
situation,
but
the
situation
with
volvo
trucks
that
no
dealer
ever
buys
unless
he's
already
got
a...
got
a
sale
waiting.
but
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
we...
as
long
as
the
market
was
identified,
and
as
long
as
they
were
buying,
we
wouldn't
require
anything
more
to
show
competition,
would
we?
