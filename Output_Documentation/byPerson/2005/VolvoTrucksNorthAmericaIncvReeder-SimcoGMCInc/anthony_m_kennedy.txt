well,
but...
i
mean,
you
say
that,
but
the
title
goes
to
the
dealer.
the
dealer
makes
the
purchase.
aren't
you...
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
and
also
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
if
these
were
automobile
dealers
that
sold
some
inventory,
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
if
you
extrapolate
this...
these
kind
of
facts.
one
dealer
being
discriminated
against,
vis
a
vis
another
dealer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
if
we
can
go
back
to
the
language,
it's
between
different
purchases
of
commodities
of
"like
grade
and
quality".
and
that
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
volvo
trucks,
generically,
must
be
looked
at...
the
policy,
with
reference
to
volvo
trucks,
generically.
suppose
one
dealer
always
got
a
10
percent
discount,
the
other
dealer
always
got
a
20
percent
discount
over
a
period
of
time.
justice

m.

it
has
to
be
purchase
by
purchase
to
determine
like
grade
or
quality?

kennedy
--two
dealers
within
10
miles
of
each
other,
customers
frequently
go
to
both
dealers
to
check
out...
to
get
the
lowest
price.
dealer
a

10
percent
discount
routinely;
dealer
b,
20
percent
discount
routinely.
over
a
period
of
time,
would
there
be
a
violation
of
the
robinson
patman
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
fact--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
almost
have
to
show
that.
but
the
evidence
of
the
head
to
head
competition,
it
seems
to
me,
too
insubstantial
to
support
liability
here.
would
you
agree?
i...
and
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i...
your
opposing
counsel
says
you
almost
concede
that,
right?
