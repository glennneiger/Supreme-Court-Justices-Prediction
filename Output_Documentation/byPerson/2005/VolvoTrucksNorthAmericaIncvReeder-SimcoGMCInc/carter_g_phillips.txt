mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
it
seems
to
me
there
are
three
issues
that
have
been
posed
by
the
way
both
this
case
has
been
argued
by
the
parties
on
the
other
side
and
as
the
questions
have
arisen.
and
the
first
one
is
whether
or
not
there
is
competition
in
this
particular
case.
and
justice
stevens'
question,
it
seems
to
me,
posed
the
issue
about
as
starkly
as
it
can
be,
is
it
not
the
case
that
under
traditional
standards
of
tampa
electric,
this
court's
decision
there,
and
a
host
of
other
cases,
that
we
define
"competition"
by
reference
to
whether
or
not
entities
compete
for
the
same...
with
respect
to
the
same
product
in
the
same
market,
same
region,
and
if
they're...
if
that's
what
you
have
by
way
of
competition,
then
you
look
to
the
next
level,
which
is
to
see,
is
there
price
discrimination,
and
is
there
injury
to
that
competition?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
clearly
did
that
with
the...
with
the
hiland
case.
that
was...
that
was
clear.
but
the
testimony
was
uncontested
on
both
sides.
both
reeder's...
reeder
testified,
"we
compete
against
other
dealers
every
day.
"
and
volvo's
witness
testified--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
other
volvo
dealers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that's
not
the
competition.
that's
the
question
as
whether
there
is
discrimination.
the
question
is,
do
volvo
dealers
compete
against
other
volvo
dealers,
in
the
first
instance?
and
with
respect
to
that,
the
testimony
was
absolutely
clear,
it's
in
the...
witnesses
for
volvo...
are
quoted
in
our
brief
at
page
8...
explicitly
say,
"we
compete,
on
a
daily
basis,
in
the
region
and
the
district,
volvo
dealer
to
volvo
dealer.
"
now,
there's
a
separate
issue--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the...
again,
there
are
lots
of
situations
where
there
are
two
purchasers.
again,
you
go
back
to
the...
to
the
four
specific
transactions
that
were
identified.
for
the
102
sales,
55
percent
of
the
sales
between
1996
and
2000
involve...
i
mean,
1998...
involved
direct
comparison
sales,
where
we
purchased
from
volvo,
and
one
of
our
competitors
200
miles
down
the
road...
and
on
interstate
highways,
200
miles
down
the
road's
the
same
as
next
door...
and
we...
we
purchased
exactly
the
same
product,
and
we
got
a
significantly
lower
concession--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--under
the
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure,
it
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--for
resale.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
anymore
than
anybody's
buying
two
cars
from
two
different
purchasers
in
the...
in
the
classic
inventory
situation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
scalia,
that
was
precisely
the
defense
that
volvo
made
at
trial.
they
put
it
to
the
jury,
"remember,
it
has
to
be
like
kind
and
quality.
"
"we
are
required
to
demonstrate
that
the
truck
that
we
are
getting
a
10
percent
discount
on
and
the
truck
that
they're
getting
a
20
percent
discount
on
is
exactly
the
same
like
kind
and
quality
of
truck.
"
and
that
was
their
defense.
and
our
witness
meticulously...
i'd
commend
the
record
to
you
if
you
want
to
read
it...
but
he
meticulously
examined
each
of
those
trucks
and
showed
that,
systematically,
for
102
sales,
they
sold
the
exact
same
truck
to
a
dealer
down
the
road,
with
a
significantly
better
price
than
the
truck
they
sold
to
us,
in
order
to
implement
the
"volvo
vision"
and
drive
my
client--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--out
of
the
dealership
business.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
he...
but
whatever
that
person's
position
was,
vis
a
vis
its
customer,
doesn't
affect
the
relationship
between
reeder
simco
and
volvo,
and
that
individual
and
volvo.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there,
it
has
to
be
a
level
playing
field.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
precisely
what
robinson
patman
is
about.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the...
it
wouldn't
necessarily,
on
an
episodic
basis.
but
what
you
have
in
this
case
is
substantial
price
discrimination
across
time,
which
this
court
held,
under
morton
salt,
triggers
an
inference
of
competitive
injury.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
putting
aside
the
fact,
your
honor,
that
i
think
that
that's
essentially
a
jury
question...
i
mean,
i
do
think
both
sides
get
to
put
on
the
evidence
that
shows
that
there's
been
discrimination
and
that
there...
and
then
we
know
what
the
market
consequences
will
be.
but
if
you
look
at
plaintiff's
exhibit
104,
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
court
of
appeals
at
577,
and
you
look
down
that
list,
you
will
see
that
they
are...
where
they're
specifically
talking
about
reeder
simco,
and
it
has...
and
it
satisfies
its
28
percent
of
its
overall
objective
in
1999;
and
then
you
go
through
the
testimony
of
reeder
simco's
coowner,
and
he's...
identifies
each
of
the
four
or
five
competing
entities
that
were
the
beneficiaries
of
those...
of
the
price
discrimination
of
those
sales
in
the
102
sales
that
were
the
basis
for
liability;
and
their
percentages
for
their
objectives
during
the
next...
during
1999
are
71
percent,
81
percent,
97
percent,
107
percent,
92
percent...
those
are...
those
are
huge
differentials.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
today,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
be
sure.
but
tomorrow,
when
i
go
to
the
next
dealer
to...
go
to
the
next
purchaser,
the
reason
i
didn't
get
that
sale
was
because
i
didn't
have
enough
capital
to
have
the
same
quality
of
salesperson
in
place
to
make
that
sale.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
can't.
under
the
contract--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
under
state...
arkansas
state
law,
it
can't.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
long
as
it
doesn't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
price--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you're
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
it...
it's
not
just
sales.
it's
always
been
lost
profits,
as
well.
and
if
we
are
paying
more,
we're
losing
money,
vis
a
vis
our
competitors.
and
then
every
day
after
that,
we're
competing
with
our...
one
arm
tied
behind
our
back
because
we
have
less
money.
and
is
there
any
reason
to
doubt
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
true.
but
we
know
from
the
record
that
volvo's
purpose
in
this
enterprise
was
to
eliminate
50
percent
of
its
dealers--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
to
do
so
by
using
price
discrimination.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
no.
to
be
sure,
no--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
course
not.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
there
are...
there
are
two
elements
to
this,
justice
scalia.
you
first
have
to
demonstrate
that
there's
discrimination.
and
the
way
you
demonstrate
anticompetitive
discrimination
is
to
show
that
there
is
a
consistent
pattern.
it
has
to
be
substantial
discrimination
over
a
substantial
period
of
time.
if
we're
trying
to
cut
deals
on
a
daily
basis,
presumably
today
you
got
a
deal
with
a
customer,
and
i'll
give
you
a
10
percent,
and
then
the
chief
justice
got
a
deal
tomorrow,
and
i
may
give
him
12
percent,
but,
2
weeks
down
the
line,
the
situations
will
likely
be
flipped
out.
you're
not
going
to
find,
where
you
have
55
percent
of
your
sales,
102
sales
involving
$250,000-plus
of
sales
differentials
to
be
the
basis
for
the
claim
that
there
is
price
discrimination
in
the
first
instance,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
sure.
we
had
thousands
of
those
examples.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
where
we...
well,
i...
had
agreed
to
buy
it.
we
had
a...
clearly,
there
was
an
understanding.
our
sales
person
thought
that,
"if
i
can
get
this
discount
at
this
rate,
i
can
cut
this
deal.
"
went
to...
went
to
volvo,
asked
for
that
rate,
volvo
said
no.
didn't
get
the
deal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
happened
literally
more
than
a
thousand
times.
the
testimony
on
that
is
rampant.
and
the
reason
we
don't
make
more
of
that,
justice
scalia,
in
this
particular
case,
is
because
the
jury
verdict
is
based
on
actual
sales.
there
is
as
very
clear
fidelity
to
the
two
purchaser
rule
in
the
way
the
jury
verdict
was
rendered
and
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
it.
that
said,
i...
a
lot
of
this
discussion
about,
you
know,
is
that
two
purchaser
rule,
in
its
most
strict
version,
the
right
way
to
interpret
the
robinson
patman
act?
our
view
is,
it's
not.
but
we
don't
have
to
get
there--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--all
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
guess
the
difficulty
i
have,
justice
breyer,
is
understanding
why
you
don't
think
we
are...
what
we
have
here
is
precisely
different
purchasers
of
commodities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
apologize
for
being--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--dense,
justice
breyer.
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
let--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
difficult--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--for
me
to
do
that,
justice
breyer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
i
understand.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
what
you
want
me
to
focus
on.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
fine.
as
long
as
you
accept
that
the
first
class
is
a
distinct
one,
and,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but...
and
it
totally
makes
my
case,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
realize
you
may
disagree
with
me
on
that,
but--
[laughter]
--we'll
start
there.
but
i
just
want
to
be
clear
that
that's
a
completely
separate
analysis.
then,
it
seems
to
me,
what
you...
what
you
have
to
go
back
to
is
the
kind
of
analysis
that
justice
stevens
was
saying,
which
is
that
when
you're
talking
about
different
purchasers
of
commodities,
there
is
no
reason
to
be
so
focused
on
the...
on
the
identical
transaction,
rather
than
recognizing,
particularly
in
the
context
of
a
dealership
arrangement
where
you're...
have
continuous
relationships
between
the...
between
the
seller...
the
manufacturer
and
the
dealer,
where
you
have
this
enormous
disadvantage
to
the
dealer,
who
has
already
sunk,
you
know,
huge
amounts
of
money
into
this
and
is
in...
essentially
at
the
whim
of
what
is
now
a
monopoly
seller...
a
monopsony...
a
monopoly
seller.
and,
under
those
circumstances,
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
say,
"look,
if
i'm
going
to
systematically
keep
getting
20...
10
percent
discounts,
where
my
competitor,
a
hundred
miles
away,
is
always
getting
20
percent
discounts.
"
that's
a
situation
that
this
statute
seems
clearly
aimed
at
dealing
with.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
have
a
5-year
contract
that's
already
in
place,
so,
at
least
for
the
5
years,
i'm
pretty
much
at
the
whim
of
my...
unless
i
want
to
breach
the
contract,
which--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
unfortunately--
[laughter]
--i
didn't
write
that
contract,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
to
make
that
argument
you
essentially
have
to
make
mush
out
of
the
last
half
of
the
robinson
patman
act,
because
it's
not
injury
in
any
line
of
commerce,
which
is
where
i
think
you
would
be
talking
about
interbrand
problems.
it's
problems
with
respect
to
customers
of
either
of
them.
and
it's
quite
clear,
and
it's
been
clear
since
1948
in
justice
black's
opinion
for
the
court
in
morton
salt,
that
this
is
designed
to
recognize
that
when
you
harm
an
intrabrand
competitor,
that
that's
the
kind
of
injury
to
competition
that
this
statute
was
aimed
at.
and
this
court
reaffirmed
that
both
in
the
1980s,
reaffirmed
it
again
in
1990,
in
texaco.
and
it's...
and
notwithstanding
some
effort
to
ask
the
court
to
revisit
morton
salt
at
this
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
principle
ought
to
be
completely
settled
at
this
stage.
if
there's
to
be
any
fix
there,
it
ought
to
be
a
fix
that's
offered
up
by
congress.
to
go
back
to,
then,
your
point,
justice
scalia,
i
told
you,
first,
you
have
this
discrimination
in
price,
you
have
to
show
that
it's
substantial,
lasts
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
you
get
the
morton
salt
inference.
you...
then
we
still
have
to
show,
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
that
we
have
actual
injury
to
our
business
and
property.
and
in
this
context,
it
seems
to
me,
the
evidence
is
absolutely
overwhelming,
because
you
have
a
situation
where,
in
1995,
we
are
next
to
none
dealer
for
volvo.
in
1995,
we're
selling
66
cars,
we're
making
$165,000.
volvo
implements
its
"volvo
vision",
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
drive
my
client
out
of
this
dealership.
it
engages
in
systematic
discrimination,
both
with
respect
to
unquestionable
purchases
on
both
sides
and,
candidly,
more
broadly
than
that.
and
the
effect
of
that,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
is
that
our
sales
go
from
65
to
34
to
18
to
8.
our
gross
profits
dropped
to
$26,327.
you
compare
that
to
the
kind
of
evidence
this
court
looked
at
in
the...
in
the
j.
truett
payne
case,
where
it
wasn't
clear
that
there
was
really
any
discrimination
involved
there,
there
was
no
drop
in
the
market,
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
diversion
of
any
sales.
and,
even
in
that
context,
this
court
was
unwilling
to
say
that
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
holding
that
the
evidence
was
flat
out
inconsistent...
or
inadequate
to
sustain
the
verdict,
was
overturned,
had
to
be
sent
back.
i
submit
to
you,
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
vastly
stronger.
the
jury
reached
the
result
that
it
did.
that
result
was
approved
in
the
face
of
a
jmol--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
affirmed--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--on
appeal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
this
case,
yes,
it
would
have
been.
we
have
evidence
that
they
clearly
didn't.
because
they
have
a
policy
of
trying
to
accomplish
the
same
thing,
and
didn't
achieve
that
in
this
particular
case,
in
at
least
two
instances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
ginsburg.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
we
clearly
aren't
raising
the
state
law
issue
here.
our
argument
here
is
that
the
robinson
patman--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--violation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
also
has
a
different
statute
of
limitations,
justice
ginsburg.
there
are
a
lot
of
differences
between
the
state
law
and
the
federal
claim
that
we're--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
we're
pursuing
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
of
course.
you
require
the
jury
to
make
a
determination
that
it's
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
that
it's
in
a
reasonable
adjustment.
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
jury
instruction
on
whether
or
not
the
comparisons
that
were
made
were
legitimate
in
any
way.
so,
that's...
you
know,
there's
no
question
that
this
court
can
certainly
establish
a
rule
that
says
certain
timeframes
are
either,
per
se,
good
or
bad,
but
that
issue
is
clearly
not
raised
by
the
way
the
jury...
this
jury
was
instructed,
because
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
instruction,
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
disputed
that
these
are
goods
of
like
grade
and
quality,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
i'm
sure
there
are
some
states
that
don't.
i
think
there
are
about
30-some
states
that
do,
as
i
recall.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
if
we
had
gotten
all
of
those
sales
the
first
time
around,
we
would
have
ended
up
with
the
profits
that
would
have
allowed
us
to
make
the
sales--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
what
we're
talking
about
is
essentially
a
jury
question,
were
we
entitled
to
say
these
were
lost
profits,
the
margins
were
reduced,
we
didn't
have
as
much
money?
that
interfered
with
our
ability
to
make
sales
in
the
future
period,
because
you
have
the
complete
before
and
after
documented
history
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
jury
question.
and
the
jury
found
in
our
favor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
hope
not.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that,
by
itself,
wouldn't
count
as
an
injury.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
not
here
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
not
here,
necessarily,
as
an
advocate
for
overturning
morton
salt,
for
obvious
reasons.
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
under
morton
salt
we
clearly
win,
because
we...
we
probably
didn't
need
to
show
as
much
as
we
did,
in
terms
of
the
impact
of
this
particular
discrimination
on
our
ability
to
compete
in
the
future.
i
think
we
were
entitled
to
a
straight
inference
of
that,
in
terms
of
the
substantial...
or
reasonable
possibility
of
injury
in
the
first
instance.
but,
beyond
that,
i...
you
know,
you
could
certainly
hold,
in
this
case,
that
reeder
simco
has
made
more
than
enough
of
a
case
in
order
to
recover
under
the
robinson
patman
act.
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we,
neverthe...
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--one--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
we...
i
mean,
we
don't
rely
on
it.
and
part
of
this...
part
of
the
problem
is
that
it's
not...
that
head
to
head
item
wasn't
part
of
the
jury
instruction.
so,
that...
we...
i
can't
rely
on
it,
in
terms
of
supporting
it.
if
you
ask
me,
outside
of
the
context
of
this
case,
would
i
defend
that
argument?
i
probably
would
try
to
defend
the
argument.
but
it's
obviously
much
tougher
when
you
only
have
one
head
to
head.
it's
completely
different
when
you're
talking
about
102
sales
to
sales
comparisons
over
years,
with
significant
differentials,
that
clearly
caused
the
kind
of
injury
we
have
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honors,
i'd
give
you
back
the
rest
of
my
time.
thank
you.
