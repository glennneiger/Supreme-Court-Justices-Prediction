mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
plaintiff
who
did
not
purchase
goods
for
resale
in
competition
with
a
favored
purchaser
can,
nonetheless,
establish
all
the
elements
of
a
robinson
patman
act
claim
by
picking
and
choosing
from
among
different
aspects
of
unrelated
transactions.
the
position
of
the
united
states
is--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
when
they
purchase
the
goods,
they
are
not
in
competition
with
any
other
volvo
dealer.
by
definition,
they
have
the
sale.
and
so,
if--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
the
point
that
i'm
making.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
in
a
different
sense,
they
may
be
in
competition--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--with
other--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--in
a
different
sense,
yes.
but
the
point
is,
the
price
discrimination
does
not
occur
when
there
is
any
competition.
and,
therefore,
the
requirements
of
the
act
are
not
satisfied.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
the...
they
may
be,
in
other
senses,
and
in...
and
in
seeking
other
customers,
in
a...
in
some
sense,
in
competition
with
other
volvo
dealers.
but,
at
the
point
that
the
price
discrimination
occurs,
they
are
not.
and,
therefore,
even
in
the...
in
the...
in
the...
well,
in
any
of
the
examples
offered
by
the
respondents
in
this
case,
they
don't
show
price
discrimination
between
competing
purchasers,
which
is
what
this
court,
in
the
morton
salt
case
and
in
other
cases,
have
indicated
the
act
was
aimed
at.
and
as
mr.
englert
indicated,
that
is
why,
in
the
70
years
since
the
robinson
patman
act
was
enacted,
we
haven't
seen
cases
like
this,
because
it
is
understood
that
the
act
has
no
application
in
these
circumstances,
and--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
would--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--and
all
the
same
structure
as
this--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--hypothetical?
well,
the
answer
is
no,
but
only
for,
i
think,
one
of
the
several
reasons
why
in
this
case
the
answer
is
no.
that
is,
in
your
hypothetical
they
are,
in
a
sense...
and
i'm
assuming
that
there
might
be
direct
head
to
head
competition,
but
the
offers
are
different...
or
affected
by
the
differing
differentials.
so,
there
is...
there
is
competition
between
the
purchasers,
and
there
is
discrimination
in
offers,
although
not
in
purchases.
so,
there
is
still
the
two
purchaser
requirement
which
is
not
satisfied
in
that
circumstance.
there
is
the...
reeder
is
not
purchasing
in...
assuming
it
loses
the
sale
to
the
other
customer,
it's
not
purchasing
in
competition
with
a
favored
customer,
a
favored
dealer,
because
it's
not
purchasing
at
all.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
i
would
point
out
that
even
if
the
court
is
unwilling
to
go
that
far
in
this
case,
that
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far
to
resolve
this
case
and
to
reverse
the
judgment
below
for
the
other...
because
of
the
other
failings
in
the
plaintiff's
case
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
don't
think
i
would
put
it
that
way.
i
think,
again,
they
don't
compete
at
the
point
at
which
the
price--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--discrimination
occurs.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
right.
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
and
that's--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--right.
other
than...
there
are
the...
the
two
examples
of
what
have
been
called
head
to
head
competition,
in
one
of
which
there
was
clearly
no
price
discrimination,
in
the
other
of
which
our
reading
of
the
record
is
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
not
have
found
that
there
was
price
discrimination.
and
even
if
there
were
price
discrimination,
that
one
instance,
standing
alone,
could
not
support
a
finding
of
a
robinson
patman
act--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--violation.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
because
there--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--because
there's
no
substantial
injury
to
competition.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
mean,
clearly--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
certainly
the
morton
salt
inference
wouldn't
apply,
because
there's
no
distinction--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
this
court's
cases,
and
the
lower
courts',
have
understood
the
act
to
require
a
likelihood
of
a
substantial
injury
to
competition--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but
one
sale
is
not
substantial,
your
honor,
i
would
submit.
and,
moreover,
in
this
case,
of
course,
they
don't
have
that
evidence
of
the
close
dealer
with
whom
they
are
in
repeated
competition
for
the
same
customers
that...
and
so,
i
don't
think
we
have
that
case.
we
don't
have
a
substantial
injury,
even
if
you
assume...
even
if
you
read
the
evidence
the
way
they
do
with
respect
to
the
one
head
to
head
competition.
and
it's
important
to
understand
that
this...
the
two
purchaser
rule
is
not
the
only
flaw
in
the
judgment
below.
the
act
requires
causation.
that
is,
the
price
differential
must
cause
the
injury
to
competition.
here,
it's
not
the
price
differential
that
causes
the
injury,
in
the
sense
that
the
robinson
patman
act
addresses.
the
act
is
addressed
to
the
situation
where
they're
competing
head
to
head,
the
favored
purchaser
has
a
competitive...
a
relative
competitive
advantage
which
allows
them
to
offer
a
lower
price
and,
thereby,
either
get
the
sale
or
reduce
the
profits
of
the
competing
purchaser.
but
that's
simply
not
the
case
here
in
these
sales
to
sales
or
offers
to
sales
competitions.
the
fact
that
some
other
dealer
in
some
other
transaction
with
some
other
customer
got
a
better
price
has
absolutely
no
relevance,
no
significance,
and
no
effect
on
reeder's
ability
to
get
a
sale
or
make
a
profit
in
its
transactions
with
an
unrelated
customer.
so,
there...
the
causation
element
that's
so
crucial
under
the
act
is
absolutely
missing
here.
and,
in
fact,
reeder's
interpretation
would
simply
read
the
injury
requirement
out
of
the
statute.
they
would
say,
"whenever
there
is
a
price
differential,
we've
been
injured,
because
if
we
had
gotten
the
lower
price
instead
of
the
higher
price,
we
would
have
made
more
money.
"
so,
there's
per
se
injury.
the
morton
salt
inference
is
converted
into
an
irrebuttable
presumption--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--contrary--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--and
they're
in
repeated
head
to
head
competition
for
the
same
customers...
one
gets...
they're
getting--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--differential
offers?
is
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
agree
that
that
would
not
be
actionable
under
the
robinson
patman
act.
the
reasons
why...
the
reason,
or
reasons,
why
depend
on
whether
they
are
in
head
to
head
competition
or
not.
if
they're
never
in
head
to
head
competition,
then
they're
never
in
competition--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--and
they
would
fail
to
have--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--they
have
to
prove
at
least
what
morton
salt
said,
which
is
price
differentials
between
competing
purchasers.
and
the
way
the
purchasers
were
competing
in
morton
salt
was
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--they
were
both
competing--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
in
this
market,
they'd
have
to
show
that
they
were
purchasers--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--at--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor,
but
they
haven't
purchased--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--they
haven't
purchased
in
connection
with
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--a
price
discrimination--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
right.
but,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
the
act
clearly
does
not
apply
to
offers.
it
requires
purchases--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--and
it
requires--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--sales.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
they
have
to
prove
that
they
were
in
competition
with
each
other
and
that
competition
was--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--injured
by--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
differential.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor,
because...
it's
not
enough
to
prove
they're
in
competition
with
each
other.
they
have
to
prove
that
they
are
in...
that
the
price
differential
injured,
or
was
likely
to
injure,
substantially,
that
competition.
and
that
is
not
true
if
they
aren't
competing
in
connection
with
the
transactions--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--in
which
the
price
discrimination
occurs.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
may
i
answer?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
if...
i
understood
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
to
address
the
situation
where,
as
in
this
circumstance,
they
are
not
competing
at
the
point
at
which
they
actually
purchase--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
product.
if
it
were
the
traditional
robinson
patman
act
case,
where
they
purchase
for
inventory
and
are
both
trying
to
sell
the
same
goods
to
the
same
customers,
then
yes,
the
problems
that
we've
identified
here
would
not
exist.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you.
