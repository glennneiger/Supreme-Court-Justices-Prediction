justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
not
ask,
isn't
it
true
that
each
of
the
parties
here,
over
a
long
period
of
time,
was
a
purchaser?
i
mean,
the...
reeder
was
a
purchaser,
was
he
not?
they
were
a
dealer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
they
were
a
purchaser.
and
were
not
the
other
people
who
purchased
from
volvo
also
purchasers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
were--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--two
purchasers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
over
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--period
of
time,
you
had
two
purchasers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
discrimination
occurred
over
a
period
of
a
couple
of
years,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--these
are
ordinary
automobile
dealers
who
sold
out
of
inventory,
would
you
agree
that
they
were...
you
had
two
purchasers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
whole
point
of
your
case
is
they're
negotiated
transactions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
just
to
get
it
in
the...
supposing
volvo
had
a
policy
of
granting
everybody
a
20
percent
concession,
and
they
had...
except
reeder...
and
they
always
granted
reeder
just
a
15
percent
concession,
and
the...
you
had
the
same
sales
pattern
you
have
here.
would
there
be
a
violation
of
the
robinson
patman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
prima
facie
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
there--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--were
dozens
and
dozens--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
sales
to
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
depends
on
how...
whether
you
regard
the
purchase
as
on
a
single...
each
single
transaction
as
a
separate
purchase
or
if
you
look
at
a
course
of
dealing
and
say
that,
over
a
period
of
years,
the
favored
dealer
is
one
purchaser
and
the
disfavored
dealer
is
the
other
purchaser.
why
can't
you
look
at
the
pattern
of
dealing
by
automobile
dealers
over
a
period
of
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
literal
language,
wouldn't
it?
if
you
treat
it,
the
purchaser,
as
a...
as...
look
not
at
just
individual
transactions,
but
what
they
do
over
a
period
of
years,
just
like
any
other...
any
ordinary
automobile
dealer.
two
dealers
in
this
market,
one
in
arlington
and
one
in
bethesda,
are
both
purchasers,
even
though
they
may
not
compete
on
the
same
transactions,
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
would
agree,
in
my
hypothetical,
there's
discrimination,
but
you'd
say
there's
no
injury
to
competition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--got
an
expert
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--even
if
you
got
an
expert
to
come
and
say,
"well,
these
two
dealers
are
in
the
same
relevant
market,
and
there's
a
likelihood
that
customers
go
to
the
favored
dealer.
"
that
would
not
be
a
prima
facie--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
can
you
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
the
dealer
didn't
purchase
goods
for
resale
in
competition
with
other
volvo
dealers?
that's
exactly
what
they
do
every
day,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can't
they
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
competition
just
from...
on
a
day
to
day
basis
over
the
years,
over
a
period
of
time,
trying
to
get
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they're
in
the
same
relevant
market,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
assuming
they're
not
in
competition
on
a
continuing
basis,
they're
only
in
competition
for
one
isolated
transaction
after
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--modify
justice
ginsburg's
question
a
little
bit.
supposing,
over
a
period
of
years,
one
dealer
always
got
15
percent
off,
and
the
other
one
always
got
20
percent,
and
there's
testimony
they're
in
the
same
relevant
market,
so
presumably
customers
can
go
to
either
one.
what
more
do
they
have
to
prove
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
the
morton
salt
case,
but
do
the...
i'm
assuming
they're
in
the
same
relevant
market
in
which
customers
patronize
both
of
them
from
time
to
time,
but
they
can't
identify
that
mr.
smith
was
here
on
this
day,
and
the
other
dealer
on
the
same
day,
but
just
an
overlapping
in
the...
in
the
same
competitive
market.
would
that
not
create
a
prima
facie
case?
and
if
not,
how
much
more
would
they
have
to
prove?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they're
both
purchasers.
they're
dealers,
in
my
hypothesis.
each
of
them
buys
a
hundred
cars
a
year,
and
one
of
them
pays
a
higher
price
than
the
other,
and
they're
in
the
same
relevant
market--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
all
purchased--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
the
purpose
of
reselling,
if
they
can
find
customers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
my
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
are
a
hundred
purchases
by
each
of
them
at
different
prices.
what
more
do
they
have
to
prove,
other
than
that
they
were
in
the
same
relevant
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
isn't
the
fact
they're--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
same--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--relevant
market
enough
to
prove
they're
in
competition
with
each
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
let
me
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
did
have
a
contract,
such
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
in
which
the
manufacturer
agreed
that,
at
any
given
point
of
time,
you
will
get
just
as
favorable
a
concession
as
any
other
volvo
dealer
could
get
at
the
same
time.
if
there
were
such
a
contract
in
place,
would
the
evidence
show
that
it
was
breached?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
also
not
disputed
now
that
these
were
goods
of
like
grade
and
quality.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you,
if
you
have
a
minute
left,
is
your
central
point
that
there
was
no
proof
of
damages
or
no
proof
of
injury
to
competition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--need
both,
but
which
is
your
principal
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
principal
argument,
that
there
was
no
injury
to
competition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
thank
you.
