mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
sixty
six
years
elapsed
between
the
passage
of
the
robinson
patman
act
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
in
that
time,
there
is
no
reported
instance
of
a
finding
of
a
violation
by
a
seller
operating
in
an
industry
like
this
one
in
which
a
sale
is
made
to
the
plaintiff
distributor
if,
and
only
if,
it
has
already
secured
a
contract
for
resale
to
a
particular
end
user.
courts
have
long
understood
that
mere
offers
at
different
prices
cannot
violate
the
act,
because
it
requires
two
purchases,
and
that
successful
purchases
in
winner
take
all
bidding
cannot
have
the
requisite
effect
on
competition.
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
would
open
up
new
vistas
for
application
of
the
robinson
patman
act
where
it
has
never
been
applied
before.
this
case--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--very
much
the
opposite,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
i
don't
agree,
with
respect,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
mere
offers,
offering
a
price
to
different
purchasers
is
not
covered
by
the
statutory
language.
with
respect
to
the
sales
to
sales
comparisons,
there
is
not
the
requisite
effect
of
such
discrimination--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--on
competition.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
but
this--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
except
that,
back
in
1947,
this
court,
in
the
bruce's
juices
case,
made
clear,
in
the
early
days
of
the
act,
that
it
takes
two
completed
sales
to
violate
the
act.
no
one
sale
can
violate
the
act.
even
earlier
than
that,
the
third
circuit,
in
the
shaw's
case,
in
1939,
laid
down
that
rule,
and
it's
been
an
accepted
rule
of
robinson
patman
act
jurisprudence
for
that
entire
time.
and
it
is
a
natural
reading
of
the
statute,
and
in
accordance
with
the
general
principle,
that
this
statute
should
be
construed
consistently
with
the
larger
body
of
antitrust
law.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
with
respect
to
the
sales--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--to
sales
transactions--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
with
respect
to
the
sales
to
sales
transactions
in
which
there
were--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--two
purchases--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
but
the
statutory
language
is
the
effect
of
"such
discrimination"
must
be
to
harm
competition
in
one
of
these
justified
instances.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
this
case
was
tried
on
the
basis
of
several
discrete
transaction
comparisons.
it
was
not
tried
on
the
basis
of
any
systematic
study
of
every
offer
to
reeder
and
every
offer
to--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--another--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--sure.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
whole
point
of
the
case
is
the...
is
twofold.
each
transaction
is
one
in
which
there
is
a
purchase
if,
and
only
if,
there
is
already
a
contract
for
resale,
so
that
when
there
is
an
offer
compared
to
a
purchase,
you
don't
have
two
purchases.
and
when
you've
already
got
the
contract
for
resale--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--if
the
requisite
effect
on
competition
is
shown,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
have
to
be
two
sales.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
but
there
would--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
and
that's
the
typical--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--robinson
patman
case.
that's
the
case
in
which
there
is
a
potential
violation.
the
case
in
which
there
is
a
sale
by
the
purchaser
if,
but
only
if...
i'm
sorry,
the
case
in
which
there
is
a
purchase
by
the
purchaser
if,
but
only
if,
it
already
has
the
sale
is
the
case
in
which
it
can't
have
lost
that
sale
in
competition
with
a
favored
dealer
because
of
price
discrimination,
which
is
what
the
statutory
language
requires,
which
is--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--why
the
robinson
patman
act--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it...
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
that's
a
closer
case
to
what's
the...
what
the
statute
was
designed
to
cover
than
this
case,
but,
yes,
that,
too,
would
be
out
of
robinson
patman.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
enough
for
now,
justice
breyer--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
two
different
issues,
justice
breyer.
with
respect
to
the
two
purchase
rule,
if
the
statutory
language
is
ambiguous,
and
if
it
can
be
read
to
say
"purchaser
status
is
enough",
then
i
think
the
principle
stated
in
all
of
this
court's
cases,
that
the
robinson
patman
act--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--should
be
construed--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--and
there's
a
textual--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
textual
answer
to
your
question
is--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
phrase--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
phrase
"the
effect
of
such
competition"
ties--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
the
effect
of
such--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--discrimination.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
i
still
question
whether--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--okay.
i
still
question
whether
the...
under
the
text...
the
effect
of
such
discrimination
was
the
requisite
effect
on--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--competition.
but--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
i
do
want
to
say
that
isn't
enough.
and,
justice
breyer,
first
of
all,
i--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
think
the
statute,
read
as
a
whole,
compels
that
conclusion.
but
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
and
if
there
is
enough
ambiguity
to
admit
of
a
different
conclusion,
then
the
principle
comes
into
play
that
cases
of
ambiguity
in
the
robinson
patman
act
are
construed
to
be
more
consistent
with
the
overall--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
everyone,
including
the
lower
courts
in
this
case,
agrees
that
you
don't
look
at
the
goods
generically.
you
have
to
look
at
their
characteristics
to
determine
like
grade
and
quality.
and
i
would
actually
think
that
the
grade--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
every
robinson
patman
case
there's
ever
been
has
been
purchase
by
purchase
at
the
level
of--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--sale
from
the
manufacturer
to
the
dealer.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
okay.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
a
manufacturer.
i'm
reading
the
statute.
i
have
to
give
a
price
on
a
particular
deal.
i
realize
i
can't
discriminate
in
price
between
different
purchasers
of
like
grade
and
quality,
where
the
effect
of
such
discrimination
may
be
one
of
the
prohibited
effects.
i
say,
"okay,
can
i
give
a
different
price
to
one
dealer
or
to
another?
"
yes,
i
can,
because
it
says
"different
purchasers
of
commodities
of
like
grade
and
quality.
"
it
is
a
specific
instance
of
a
purchase,
a
specific
instance
of
discrimination.
the
very
words
in
the
statute
are
what
judges
have
read
consistently
to
compel
that
result.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
again--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
think
the
answer
is
no,
your
honor,
although
that...
although
that
would
be
a
closer
case--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--than
this
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
this
case
was
tried
on
the
basis
of
the
same
transactions.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
that
would
be
a
closer
case.
but
the...
it
might
fit
the
policy
of
the
act,
but
it's
a
very
poor
fit
with
the
words
of
the
statute.
and--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that
would
be
the
argument
in
favor
of
an
expansive
reading
of
the
language
in
the
hypothetical
example
to
cover
that
case.
but
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
general
policies
of
antitrust
law.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no.
the
effect
of
such
discrimination
has
to
be
to
harm
competition
with
the
favored
purchaser.
and
if
all
transactions
are
hermetically
sealed
from
one
another,
yes,
the
buyer
might
like
a
better
price,
but
it's
not
complaining
about
the
effect
of
such
discrimination
on
competition
with
the
favored
purchaser.
to
put
this
point
in
perspective,
imagine
that
volvo
raised
its
price
to
every
so
called
favored
purchaser--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--in
this
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there's
no
injury
to
competition
that
is
the
effect
of
such--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--competition
with--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--a
favored
purchaser
that
is
the
effect
of
such--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--oh,
if
you
have
that
evidence?
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
there
is
a
likelihood
that,
in
a
pattern,
customers
have
gone
to
the
favored
dealer?
that's...
that
begins
to
come
within
the
statutory
language
in
a
way
this
case
does
not.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
is
no
customer
testimony,
no
evidence
of
diversion
to
any
favored
dealer
in
this
case,
no
evidence
that
reeder
lost
profits
because
of
the
price
given
to
any
favored
dealer,
only
evidence
that
if
reeder
had
gotten
a
price,
it
would
have...
better
price...
it
would
have
made
more
money.
well,
every
dealer--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
main
problem
with
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
is,
it
takes
the
last
phrase
of
the
statute
and
makes
it
no
longer
a
limiting
phrase.
it
essentially
makes
all
price
discrimination
illegal.
and
this
court
said,
in
brooke
group,
and
has
said
in
many
other
cases,
that
it
is
not...
not
all
price
discrimination
is
made
illegal
by
this
statute.
it
does
require
the
requisite
effect
on
competition.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
heart
of
the
theory
of
this
case
came
up
in
colloquy
between
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
phillips.
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
that
reeder
doesn't
lose
a
sale
because
of
the
concession
that
volvo
gives
to
the
other
dealer,
which
makes
this
quite
different
from
every
other
robinson
patman
case.
mr.
phillips'
response
was,
"that's
today,
your
honor.
"
"but
our
future
ability
to
compete
is
impaired.
"
well,
that's
very
similar
to
the
evidence
this
court
referred
to
as
j.
truett
payne.
the
court
didn't
go
all
the
way
and
say
that
that
wasn't
enough
to
give
rise
to
damages
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
but
the...
but
all
nine
justices
agreed
that
such
evidence
was
very
weak.
the
fifth
circuit,
on
remand,
threw
out
the
jury
verdict,
a
case
that
arose
in
the
same
posture
as
this
case.
and
there
is
not...
as
we
said
in
the
reply
brief,
reeder
is
complaining
about
price,
not
price
discrimination.
now,
let
me
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
record.
mr.
phillips
says
the
"volvo
vision"
was
to
get
rid
of
dealers,
and
to
do
so
through
price
discrimination.
that
is
a
leap
of
faith
that
reeder
asked
the
jury
to
make
at
trial,
but
there
is
not
an
iota
of
evidence
connecting
volvo's
interest
in
making
its
dealer
network
smaller
and
more
efficient
to
price
discrimination.
that's
entirely
a
leap
of
faith.
mr.
phillips
says
an
inference
should
be
made.
that's
not
the
kind
of
inference
we
usually
allow
juries
to
draw
in
antitrust
cases
without
some
evidence.
the
evidence
was
actually
that
reeder's
biggest
customer,
new
hi
way,
which
was
82
percent
of
its
business,
was
bought
by
a
memphis
company.
so,
just
to
point
to
reeder's
before
and
after
sales
is
really
terribly
misleading,
in
terms
of
causation
here
between
so
called
discrimination
and
the
decline
in
reeder's
business.
the
so
called
102
sales
are
four
transactions.
there's
one
77-truck
transaction
to
new
hi
way
before
it
was
bought
by
the
memphis
company,
and
25
other
trucks
in
the
other
three
transactions.
they
are
all
cases
in
which
all
reeder
did
was
take
its
own
completed
sales
and
compare
them
to
sales
by
some
other
dealer
in
some
other
state.
reeder
wasn't
competing
for
the
sale
to
that
dealer's
customer.
that
customer
wasn't
competing
for
the
sale
to
reeder's
customer.
so
it
is,
as
justice
ginsburg's
questions
pointed
out,
completely
a
mix
and
match
approach.
and
bill
heck
conceded
that
there
were
times
when
reeder
got
better
concessions
than
other
dealers.
if
you
have
a
company
that
doesn't
engage
in
uniform
pricing,
as
volvo
does
not,
it's
not
going
to
be
hard
for
any
plaintiff,
whether
it's
reeder
or
reeder's
competitor,
to
come
up
with
instances
in
which
it
was
the
so
called
disfavored
dealer
if
it
is
admissible
to
compare
transactions
to
completely
unrelated
transactions,
which
is
what
the
proof
at
trial
in
this
case
was.
thank
you.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
both,
your
honor.
they
need
both.
they
need--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--in
2(a)--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--my
principal
argument
is
under
2(a),
but
if
i
fail
on
that,
i
think
they
fail
under
clayton
act,
section
4,
as
well.
and--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that
was
the
effect
of
such
discrimination,
yes.
