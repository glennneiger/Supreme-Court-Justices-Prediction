well,
and
if
there
was
a
sale
to
the
other
dealer.
you
would
say
that
there
had
to
be
a
sale
to
the
other
dealer.

mr.
englert,
i
thought
you
were
relying
on
the
succeeding
phrase,
where
"either
or
any
of
the
purchases
involved
in
such
discrimination
are
in
commerce.
"
which
seems
to
require
that...
"to
discriminate
in
price
between
different
purchasers
where
either
or
any
of
the
purchases
involved
in
such
discrimination.
"
--i
thought
that's
what
you
were
hanging
your
hat
on,
to
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
discrimination
in
particular
sales.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
evidence
was
there
of
competition
here?
how...
did
you
bring
forward
instances
where
they
both
bid
for
sale
of
special
trucks
to
a
single
repurchaser?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it's
very
hard
to
compare
those
two
sales,
because
they
all
depend
upon
the
special
features
on
the
trucks
that
are
ordered
by
the
particular
individual,
and
also
how...
you
know,
how
much
of
a
hard
bargain
that
individual
is
driving.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
compare
a
sale
to
one...
one
person
with
xyz
features
on
the
truck
with
a
sale
to
a
totally
different
person
with
abc
features
on
the
truck.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
resale--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
a
different
purchaser,
who
may
have
been
in
a
better
position
with
regard
to
the
negotiation
than
any
of
your
customers
were.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
it
unreasonable...
why
does
it
violate
the
principle
of
robinson
patman,
and
why
does
it
destroy
competition,
for
volvo
to
say,
"we'll
make
whatever
discount
it
takes
to
get
the
sale,
and
if
this
dealer
needs
a
20
percent
discount
for
this
sale,
but
this
other
fellow
over
here
only
needs
a
10
percent
discount
to
make
that
sale,
we're
going
to
have
a
differential
discount?
"
why...
i
don't
see
why
that
harms
competition.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
a...
that's
a
broad
robinson
patman
principle
you're
arguing
for,
that
a...
that
a
seller
such
as
volvo
has
to
make
sure
that
each
of
its
distributors
makes
the
same
profit?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
works
its
system
in
such
a
way
that
one
of
them
is
making
less
profit
than
another,
it's
liable?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
instance
where
you
made
an
offer
to
a
buyer
assuming
that
you'd
get
the
kind
of
a
break
that
volvo
gives
to
other
dealers...
all
right
+/?
you
made
that
offer,
and
the
buyer
says,
"yes,
i'll
take
it
at
that
price.
"
--and
then
you
go
to
volvo,
and
they
won't
give
you
that
advantage?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
you
made
the
offer
to
the
buyer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
buyer
had
agreed
to
buy
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
should
have
written
a
better
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
on
a
misinterpretation
of
robinson
patman.

mr.
phillips,
how
many
states
have
these
fair
franchising
laws?
are
there
any
states
that
don't?
