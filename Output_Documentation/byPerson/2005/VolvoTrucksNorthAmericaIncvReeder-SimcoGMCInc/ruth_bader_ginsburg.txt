mr.
englert--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--suppose
you
had
a
case
of
two
volvo
dealers,
and
the
scheme
is,
as
this
one,
specially
ordered
goods
with
competitive
bidding,
but,
over
a
substantial
period
of
time,
one
dealer...
we'll
call
that
dealer
the
"favored
dealer"...
consistently
gets
higher
concessions,
and
the
other
dealer,
who
ends
up
being
the
plaintiff
in
the
case,
consistently,
in
that
same
period,
gets
lower
concessions.
so,
we
don't
have
a
picture
of
what
you
call
"mix
and
match",
but
two
dealers,
one
consistently
getting
higher
concessions,
and
one
consistently
getting
lower,
and,
therefore,
missing
out
on
sales
or
making
sales
at
a
very
low
profit.
that,
too,
would
be
out
of
robinson
patman,
if
i
understand
your
view
of
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
hungar,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
englert
that
even
if
you
had...
you
could...
you
had
a
case
based
on
two
dealers,
one
consistently
gets
higher
concessions,
one
consistently
gets
lower
concessions,
and
they're
in
roughly
the
same
market...
that
even
that
would
not
be
covered
by
robinson
patman?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
not
putting
the
head
to
head
in.
just,
one
of
his
sales
gets
lower
concessions;
one,
higher.
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
the
problem
that
i
have
with
even
accepting
your
theory
is
what
the
other
side
calls
the
"mix
and
match"
quality
of
your
evidence.
that
is,
you
say
here's
reeder,
disfavored,
and
here's
someone
else,
favored.
but
it's
not
consistently
the
same
someone
else.
and,
for
all
we
know,
someone
else
could
make
a
case
saying,
"we
compare
ourselves
with
reeder,
and
we
say,
oh,
there
was
that
sale
7
months
ago,
where
they
got
a
whopping
discount
and
we
got
a
much
smaller
one.
"
you're
not...
you
don't
have
the
same
favored
customer.
you're
picking
from
a
series
of
sales,
and
we
don't
know
how
manipulative
this
proof
is.
and
we
i
mean...
and
we
don't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
did...
you
did
get
a
judgment
on
the...
whatever
it
was...
the
state
franchises
act,
and
that
is
not
being
contested--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
if...
the
question
is
whether
fair
franchising
practices...
were
there
unfair
practices?
you
won
a
verdict
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fairness
in
franchising
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
won
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
won
on
it.
but
the
difference
is
that
that
doesn't
give
you
treble
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--limitations,
one
of
the
aspects
of
this
matches...
that
in
one
case
you
went
back
as
much
as...
there
was
a
7-month
differential.
is
there
a
timeframe,
if
we
adopt
your
theory,
about...
in
which
you
can
engage
in
this
comparison?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case,
calling
for
interpretation
of
a
federal
law,
the
robinson-patman
price
discrimination
act,
involves
specially
ordered
products,
heavy-duty
volvo
trucks,
sold
by
franchised
dealers
through
a
competitive
bidding
process.
in
this
process,
the
retail
customer
states
its
specifications
and
invites
bids,
generally
from
dealers
franchised
by
different
manufacturers.
only
when
a
volvo
dealer’s
bid
proves
successful
does
the
dealer
arrange
to
purchase
the
trucks,
which
volvo
then
builds
to
meet
the
customers’
specifications.
reeder-simco,
an
arkansas
volvo
dealer,
sued
volvo,
alleging
that
reeder’s
sales
and
profits
declined,
because
volvo
offered
other
dealers
price
concessions
more
favorable
than
the
discounts
volvo
offered
to
reeder.
seeking
travel
damages
under
the
robinson-patman
act
and
compensatory
damages
under
the
arkansas
franchise
practices
act,
reeder
prevailed
on
both
federal
and
state
claims
at
trial
and
on
appeal
to
the
8th
circuit.
we
granted
review
on
the
federal
claim
to
resolve
this
question:
may
a
manufacturer
offering
different
wholesale
prices
to
different
dealers
be
held
liable
under
the
robinson-patman
act
absent
the
showing
that
the
manufacturer
discriminated
between
dealers
contemporaneously
competing
to
resell
to
the
same
retail
customer?
state
law
protecting
franchisees
may
provide,
and
in
this
case
has
provided,
a
remedy
for
the
dealer
exposed
to
conduct
of
the
kind
reeder
alleged;
but
the
federal
robinson-patman
act,
we
hold,
does
not
cover
reeder’s
complaint.
the
act
centrally
addresses
price
discrimination
between
purchases
of
products
of
light
grade
and
quality
who
compete
to
resell
those
products.
competition
of
that
character
ordinarily
is
not
involved
when
a
product
subject
to
special
order
is
sold
to
a
customer-specific
competitive
bidding
process.
congress
passed
the
robinson-patman
act
in
1936
to
combat
perceived
harm
to
competition
occasioned
by
powerful
buyers,
rather
than
sellers;
specifically,
congress
responded
to
the
advent
of
large
chain
stores,
enterprises
with
the
clout
to
obtain
lower
prices
for
goods
than
smaller
buyers
could
demand.
reeder
presented
three
principle
categories
of
proof
at
trial:
first,
reeder
compared
concessions
it
received
on
four
occasions
when
it
bid
successfully
against
non-volvo
dealers
and
thus
purchased
volvo
trucks
with
more
favorable
concessions
other
successful
volvo
dealers
received
were
bidding
process
in
which
reeder
did
not
participate;
second,
reeder
compared
concessions
volvo
offered
on
several
occasions
when
reeder
bid
unsuccessfully,
again,
against
non-volvo
dealers
with
more
favorable
concessions
received
by
other
volvo
dealers
who
gained
contracts,
again,
on
which
reeder
did
not
bid;
finally,
reeder
brought
up
two
instances
in
which
reeder
did
bid
against
other
volvo
dealers
for
a
particular
sale.
in
one,
volvo
initially
offered
reeder
and
the
other
dealer
the
same
concession;
volvo
ultimately
granted
a
larger
concession
to
the
other
dealer,
but
only
after
that
dealer
had
won
the
bid.
in
the
second
instance
of
head-to-head
competition
that
reeder
identified,
volvo
increased
reeder’s
initial
discount
to
match
the
discount
offered
to
the
other
competing
volvo
dealer;
neither
dealer
won
the
bid.
mixed
and
matched
selective
comparisons
of
the
manipulable
kind
reeder
presented,
we
hold,
do
not
show
the
injury
to
competition
targeted
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
reeder
did
not
establish
that
it
was
disfavored
vis-à-vis
the
other
volvo
dealers
in
the
uncommon
instances
in
which
they
competed
for
the
same
sale,
let
alone
that
the
alleged
discrimination
was
substantial.
for
the
reasons
just
sketched
and
more
fully
drawn
out
in
the
court’s
opinion,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
