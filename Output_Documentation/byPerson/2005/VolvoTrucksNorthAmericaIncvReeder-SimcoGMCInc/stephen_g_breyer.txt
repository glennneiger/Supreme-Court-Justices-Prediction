justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
you
go
back
to
the
language...
are
you
finished
with
that
answer?
go
ahead
and
finish,
if
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
respect
to
the
language,
how
do
you
read
it?
i
think
it's
ambiguous.
"to
discriminate
in
price
between
different
purchasers
of
commodities.
"
do
you
read
it...
"different
purchaser"...
"to
discriminate
in
price
in
respect
to
that
commodity
that
is
purchased?
"
do
you
read
it
"to
discriminate
in
price
between
different
purchasers
of
commodities...
i.e.,
the
commodity,
the
particular
item...
the
commodity
there
refers
to
the
particular
item
in
respect
to
which
there
is
the
discrimination?
"
how
do
you
want
to
read
it,
literally?
i
just
want
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--literal
reading
of
the
statute
to...
i
agree
with
you,
60
years,
nobody's
questioned
it.
i
agree
with
you,
policy
reasons,
very
strongly
on
your
side.
i
agree
with
you,
at
least
hypothetically,
but
for
the
particular
language.
so,
look
at
the
phrase
and
read
the
language
as
you
want
me
to
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
giving--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--me
a
policy
argument.
i
don't
want
a
policy
argument,
for
the
moment.
i
want
to
know...
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
word
"purchaser"
means
"purchaser
in
respect
to
the
particular
commodity...
this
one
that
is
purchased,
there
has
to
be
a
discrimination
in
price.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
you're
hearing,
i
think,
is,
well,
this
person,
the
dealer,
bought
other
items
in
respect
to
which
there
was
no
discrimination
in
price.
so,
he
is
a
purchaser
of
that
commodity.
you
see,
"commodity"
could
refer
to
the
kind
of
thing...
volvo
trucks...
or
it
could
refer
to
the
particular
thing...
this
truck.
and
i
want
to
know
how
you
read
the
literal
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
i
want--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
textual
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no.
i'm
very--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--sorry.
the
effect
of
such
competition--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--was
conceded
in
this
case,
that
there's
the
effect
on
the
competition.
there
are
two
separate
things.
there
is
the
truck
that
was
purchased
by
the
disfavored
dealer.
in
respect
to
that,
he
wasn't
hurt,
in
the
sense
of
the
statute,
because,
even
though
he
got
a
lower
profit
margin,
that
doesn't
count.
i'm
not
focusing
on
that.
i
am
focusing
upon
the
truck
that
he
did
not
purchase.
the
reason
that
the
disfavored
dealer
did
not
purchase
that
truck
is
that
he
had
a
rival...
maybe
there's
only
one
case
of
it,
but
there's
at
least
one...
he
had
a
rival,
the
favored
dealer,
who
got
the
purchase.
he
got
the
order
from
the
customer,
and
then
ordered
the
truck.
now,
in
that
one,
i
take
it,
the
problem
is
that
there
was
no
purchase
by
the
disfavored
dealer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
what
you're
hearing
is,
"so
what?
"
"he
was
a
dealer
whose
line
of
business
was
to
purchase
volvo
trucks,
and,
therefore,
he
is
a
purchaser
of
a
commodity...
namely,
volvo
trucks.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
was
a
discrimination...
namely,
the
offer
was
discriminatory.
and
there
was
a
harm
to
competition,
in
the...
in
the
robinson
patman
sense...
his
rival
got
the
sale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
i
want
the
textual
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
effect
of
such
discrimination
is
that
his
next
door
rival,
in
effect,
"got
the
sale".
do
you
want
to
say
that
isn't
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
assume
i
don't
agree
with
you
about
that.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you've
put
your
finger
right
on
it.
my
question
is
so
obvious
that
you're
not
giving
me
an
answer.
every
case
for
60
years
has
been
on
your
side
of
it.
those
judges,
though,
were...
must
have
been
reading
some
language.
and
how
did
they
interpret
that
language?
that's
all
i'm
asking
you.
a
very
literal
question.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
policy
or
anything.
and
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
take
the
statute
and
read
the
language
so
that
it
is
possible
for
you
to
win
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
the...
hiland...
is
that
the
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
hiland
dairy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
a...
i
mean,
you
could
go
in...
i
see
that.
but
what...
is
there
any
authority
for
that,
that
just
one...
a
head
to
head
competition,
he
bought
the
truck.
let's...
keep
that
out
of
it,
so
imagine
they
bought
the
truck,
they
resold
it,
and
the
market
structure
is
such
there
probably
is
quite
a
lot
of
competition,
in
fact,
with
other
dealers,
and
they
lost
at
least
one
sale.
that's
not
enough
to
prove
an
injury
to
competition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
authority
for
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different
matter.
that's
a...
what...
i'm
saying,
what
authority
is
there...
have
there
been
cases
in
which
that
was
not
viewed?
after
all,
let's
suppose
the
dealers
are
located
geographically
in
about
the
same
place,
and
it's
logical
to
think
they'd
go
for
the
same
customers.
they
overlap.
their
territories
are
close.
logical
to
think
people
shop
around
for
trucks.
and
we
have
in
the
record
one
item
where
they...
one
instance
in
which
they
found
the
customer,
and
he
said,
"yeah,
i
did...
i
did
go
and
shop
in
both.
"
"i
lost.
"
--the
disfavored
dealer
lost
the
sale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
any
authority?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
say,
"this
is
our
evidence
that
it
is
likely.
"
just
what
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
the
robinson--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
it's
not,
the...
the
reason...
i
thought,
for
about
60
years,
the
words
"different
purchasers
of
commodities",
it
forbids
any
person
to
discriminate
in
price
between
different
purchasers
of
commodities.
now,
you
have
to
refer...
as
soon
as
i
ask
the
question,
or
start
getting
into
the
language,
i
forget
the
statute,
and
it's
so
complicated
that
i'm
giving
you
time
to
think
about
it--
[laughter]
--and
to
think
of
those
words
in
your
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a...
it's
forbidden
to
discriminate
in
price
between
different
purchasers
of
commodities.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
had
always
thought...
and
i
think
the
courts'
decisions
bear
that
out,
or
the
absence
of
decisions...
that
the
words
"discriminate
in
price
between
different
purchasers
of
commodities.
"
meant
you
can't
discriminate
in
price
between
different
purchasers
of
the
item,
or
items,
in
respect
to
which
the
discrimination
of
price
exists.
that's
what
i
thought
it
meant.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
was
the
general
understanding
in
the
antitrust
bar,
that
was
the
general
understanding
of
the
courts.
and
either
it's
not
permissible
to
give
such
an
interpretation...
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
be;
it's
literal...
or
there's
a
good
policy
reason
for
not
doing
it
in
respect
to
the
policy.
and
in
respect
to
the
policy,
what
worries
me
about
the
broader
interpretation
is
suddenly
doing
what
volvo...
forbidding
volvo
from
doing
what
it
probably
wants
to
do
here.
if
it
wants
to
get
rid
of
its
dealers,
it's
because
it
wants
to
compete
better
with
other
brands.
and
that
means
lower
prices
for
consumers,
though
individual
dealers
might
be
hurt.
so,
if
i'm
trying
to
read
that
law
consistent
with
60
years
of
history,
and
the
basic
purposes
of
the
antitrust
law,
i
guess
i
would...
might
favor
your
opponents
in
this.
i'm
exposing
my
entire
line
of
thought.
i'm
trying
to
protect
interbrand
competition,
why...
while,
at
the
same
time,
not
being...
not
being
unfair
to
the
purposes
of
robinson
patman;
and,
therefore,
i'm
reading
this
fairly
literally,
as
it's
been
read.
so,
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
said...
i
said
they...
in...
the
problem
for
you
is
that,
in
respect
to
discrimination
between
the
item,
or
items,
the...
in
respect
to...
the
purchase
of
the
item,
or
items,
in
respect
to
which
the
discrimination
existed.
insofar
as
there
were
items,
or
items,
purchased,
there
is
no
discrimination.
at
least
there
is
no
discrimination
that...
in
terms
of
the
injury
of
the
statute,
creates
that
kind
of
injury.
in
respect
to
instances
where
you
have
a
strong
case
of
the
right
kind
of
injury,
there
was
no
purchase,
defined
as
i
just
defined
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
let
me
deal--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--with
the
latter.
i
will
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
are
some
items
where
your
client
bought
the
truck.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
he
bought
the
truck,
he
got
the
sale,
although
he
earned
less
profit.
put
those
to
the
side.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
focus--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
you
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
focus--
[laughter]
--on
the
items...
let's
focus
on
the
items
where
he
didn't
get
the
sale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
he
didn't
get
the
sale,
there
was
no
purchase
of
the
item,
or
items,
from
the
manufacturer
in
respect
to
which
the
discrimination
existed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay?
now,
it's
that
second
class--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
it's
distinct.
of
course--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
well,
you
have
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
suggest
something
very...
to
me,
quite
interesting,
but
it
would
be
quite
a
departure,
i
think,
from
prior
law
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you
want
to
go
look
at
this,
you
know,
you
say,
all
right,
here's...
we
should
be
realistic
about
it.
we're
going
to
be
realistic.
realistic,
they...
we're
only
now
looking
at
the
cases
where
they
undoubtedly
bought
the
item,
but
the
profit
was
lower.
there's
no
purchaser
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
got
a
lower
profit.
and
i
think,
there,
the
mine
run
of
cases
is
against
you
that
that
counts
as
an
injury.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
yes,
but
it's...
you
know,
it
shows
that
they're
going
to
be
hurt,
that
they
may
be
driven
out
of
business.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
indeed,
the
market
in...
the
dealership
market,
whatever...
if
that's
a
separate
market,
which
it
might
be...
becomes
more
concentrated,
and
the
result
of...
you
know,
i
could
make
a...
tell
a
little
story
there
that
would
be
quite
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
law.
so
we
follow
that
approach
in
this
case
and
say
goodbye
to
morton
salt,
because
morton
salt,
after
all,
was
a
case
that
was
quite
formalistic.
it
didn't
really
look
to
the
injury
to
competition
in
a
market.
it
had
a
formalistic
slogan
that
would,
in
fact,
be
a
proxy
for
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
do
you
think
of
that?
we
follow
your...
we
follow
your
advice,
we
say,
"okay,
we're
going
to
be
very
realistic
in
the
future.
"
"forget
the
presumptions.
"
"and,
court,
look
to
see
whether
competition,
in
the
sense
of
increased
concentration
through
people
going
out
of
business,
will
lead
to
higher
prices
with
the
ordinary
antitrust
proxies
there.
"
what
about
that?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
you...
you
know,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
being
a
little--
