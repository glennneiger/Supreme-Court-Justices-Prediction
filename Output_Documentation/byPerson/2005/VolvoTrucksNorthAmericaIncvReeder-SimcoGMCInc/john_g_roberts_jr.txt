chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
volvo
trucks
north
america
versus
reeder
simco
gmc.
mr.
englert.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
concede,
though,
don't
you,
mr.
englert,
that
the
language
of
the
statute
covers
the
conduct
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
have
a
person
who's
engaged
in
commerce,
who's
discriminating
in
the
price
that
they
offer
to
different
purchasers.
now,
i
know
your
argument
about
the
structure,
but
the
actual
language
does
seem
to
encompass
the
activity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--get
to
your
first
point,
the
statute
talks
about
discrimination
in
price
between
different
purchasers,
and
not
different
actual
purchases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
seem
it's
that
much
of
a
stretch
to
cover
would
be
purchasers,
potential
purchasers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
understand
your
argument
that
there's
no
injury
or
impact
in
competition
for
resale
of
the
trucks.
what's
wrong
with
looking
at
the
statute
as
being
concerned
to
protect
competition
to
be
the
volvo
dealer?
in
other
words,
you
know,
they're
competing...
if
volvo's
restructuring
its
approach,
they're
competing
to
be
the
favored
dealer,
even
though
they
don't
compete
with
other
volvo
dealers
directly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
the...
and
the
main
failing
there
is
that
volvo
trucks
and
reeder
simco
do
not
compete
in
the
same
market
for
sales
of
volvo
trucks.
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
record?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
for
any--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--particular
sales.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
see.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
other
volvo
dealers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
the
volvo
policy
was,
if
you
had
two
dealers
competing
for
the
same
sale,
they
gave
the
same
discount
to
each
dealer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there's
never...
but,
in
those
situations,
there's
never
two
purchases,
there's
always
one...
there's
only
one
completed
purchase.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
was
for
a
resale
to...
that
was
for
resale
to
different
purchasers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
nobody's
buying
two--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--nobody's
buying
two
trucks
from
two
different
purchasers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips,
when
you
lose--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
i
may.
when
you
lose
a
sale,
it's
because
volvo
didn't
give
you
a
big
enough
discount.
it's
not
because
they
gave
another
volvo
dealer
a
bigger
discount.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
sure,
but,
i
mean,
that's...
i
mean,
long
term...
of
course,
volvo
can
terminate
you,
as
a
dealer,
tomorrow.
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
what...
but
it...
under
the
robinson
patman
act,
it
can.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
classic--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--case
that
the
robinson
patman
act
is
directed
to
is
when
you
lose
sales
because
they're
giving
bigger
discounts
to
other
sellers.
and
that's
just
not
the
case
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
volvo's
interest
may
be
in
as...
making
as
much
money
off
of
sales
this
year,
and
they
may
not
be
terribly
concerned
about
whether
you,
as
a
reseller,
are
making
enough
profit
to
last
3
years
or
5
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
not
at
the
whim
of
a
monopoly
seller.
you
mentioned
to
me
just
a
little
while
ago,
you've
got
a
contract
with
them.
you
can
put
in
that
contract
whatever
you
want
about
pricing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
the
policy
argument...
at,
sort
of,
the
level
of
the
forest,
rather
than
the
trees...
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
designed
to
prefer
competition
in
interbrand...
in
the
interbrand
market,
rather
than
intrabrand,
and
that,
therefore,
to
the
extent
there's
ambiguity,
that
supports
an
interpretation
that
allows
the
manufacturer
to
strengthen
his
interbrand
position,
as
opposed
to
protect
the
intrabrand
position?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument
that
focuses
on
the
dealer's
profits,
i
guess,
doesn't
depend
upon
you
losing
those
sales
at
all.
i
mean,
if
you...
you
had
made
all
the
sales,
but
you
still
thought
you
should
have
gotten
a
bigger
discount
that
would
have
allowed
you
to
make
more
money,
you'd
have
the
same
argument,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
you
just
go
back
and
look
again,
7
months
or
a
year
down
the
road,
and
if
somebody
else
was
getting
a
bigger
discount...
if
you
had
gotten
the
bigger
discount,
you
would
have
made
more
money
on
those
sales,
and
then
you
would
have
had
more
capital,
and
you'd
be
able
to
be
a
dealer
for
a
longer
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
englert,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
in
no.
