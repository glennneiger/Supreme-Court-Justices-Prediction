is
that
all
in
judge
bryson's
decision?
i
certainly
didn't
see
it
there.

i
didn't
see
anything
about
irrebuttable
presumption.

one
of
the
problems
with
the
district
court
exercising
equitable
discretion
without
a
close
review
by
the
federal
circuit
is
just
the
thing
that
the
federal
circuit
was
created
to
handle,
that
is,
to
get
a
tremendous
disparity
among
district
judges.
i
don't
know
that
it's
only
in
marshall,
texas
that
you
have
a
tilt
in
one
direction
or
in
the
other.
so
the
federal
circuit
is
put
there
not
to
say
that
the
district
judges
have
no
discretion,
but
to
try
to
rein
it
in
somewhat
so
that
you
won't
have
wide
disparities,
which
you
very
well
might
have
if
you
just
say
discretion
to
the
district
judges
and
very
light
review
on
appeal.

well,
isn't
it
a
concern
that
congress
didn't
provide
for
compulsory
licensing
which
this
seems
to
have
a
very
strong
resemblance
to?
it
says
ebay
wants
to
do
this,
so
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
for
it,
but
the
patentee
can't
stop
them.
it
just
has...
in
effect,
has
to
license
them
to
do
it.
