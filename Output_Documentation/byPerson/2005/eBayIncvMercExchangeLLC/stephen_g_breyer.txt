justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
justice
scalia's
question,
i
was
trying
to
think
of
some,
and
i
was
trying
to
think
the
analogy
might...
you
might
find
some
analogy
in
the
public
utilities
field,
the...
or
a
ferris
wheel
or
something.
what
you
want
is
a
person
who
uses
his
property
not
at
all
himself,
but
licensed
the
public
generally.
and
now
would
a...
would
a
court
issue
an
injunction
there?
and
as
i
think
about
that,
i
don't
realize
i
don't
know
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
what...
i
mean,
that...
that's
what
you're
trying
to
analogize
this
case
to,
i
guess,
is
a
person
who
licenses
others
to
use
his
property
and
never
uses
it
himself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there,
i
don't
know
how
courts
do
normally
act
in
other
areas
of
property
law.
