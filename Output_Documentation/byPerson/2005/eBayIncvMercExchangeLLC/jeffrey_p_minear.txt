mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
united
states
submits
that
the
right
to
a
patent
is
an
important
matter,
but
it
must
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
remedies
as
well.
and
the
united
states
further
submits
the
patentee's
right
to
an
injunction
should
be
covered
by
the
familiar
four
factor
test
this
court
has
applied
in
cases
such
as
weinberger
v.
romero
barcelo.
this
court's
express
endorsement
of
the
four
factor
test
would
provide
disciplined
guidance
and
a
framework
for
the
lower
courts
to
evaluate
whether
or
not
a
patent
should
issue
in
any
particular
case.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
did
not
make
express
reference
to
the
four
factor
test.
nevertheless,
it
did
identify
the
difficulties
with
the...
the
district
court's
decisions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
absolutely
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
not
exactly,
your
honor.
we
think
that
there
is
some
legitimate
confusion
among
the
patent
bar
and
in
the
community
about
whether
or
not
this
test
issues
nearly
automatically
or
not.
certainly
there
are
many
amicus
briefs
on
both
sides.
and
we
think
it's
useful
for
this
court
to
make
clear
that
this
is
an
exercise
of
equitable
discretion.
now,
judge
bryson,
i
think,
was
aware
of
the
four
factor
test.
in
fact,
both
parties
cited
the
four
factor
test
before
the
district
court.
he
was
also
aware
of
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
that's
a
well
established
standard
and
the
parties
cited
that
standard
to
the
federal
circuit
in
the
course
of
briefing
this
case
below.
but
what
we
think
this
court
can
do
is
it
can
provide
guidance
on
how
those
factors
are
applied
in
the
patent
context
in
this
very
important
area.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
correct.
the
judgment
is
correct.
but
we
think
that
there's
some
benefit
to
this
court
explaining
why
that
is
so,
and
i'd
like
to--
