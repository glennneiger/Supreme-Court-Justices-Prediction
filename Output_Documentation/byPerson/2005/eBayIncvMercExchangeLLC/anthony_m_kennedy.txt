m.

well,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i'm...
i
interrupted
you.
but
the...
the
business
process
point
you
give
away
fairly
quickly.
i...
i
thought
that
was
rather
substantial.
the
whole
point
is,
is
that
a
business
process
patent
is...
is
difficult
to
define
and
could
be
very...
it
can
be
very
restrictive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
concern
is
if
you
take
that
away,
i
don't
know
if
you've
got
a
lot
left
for
the...
saying
no
injunction
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
tell
me
how...
how
this
works.
it
seems
to
me
that
an
injunctive
hearing
is...
might
be
the
cheapest,
most
effective
way
to...
to
sort
out
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
violation.
you
call
the
parties
in
and
they
indicate
what...
what
they
propose
to
do,
and
the
judge
says,
well,
this
is
within
it
or
it's
without
it.
it's...
it's
much
cheaper
than
a...
a
new
lawsuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
this
gives
you
the
advantage
of
coming
in
in
advance
saying,
i
want...
i...
i
want
a
ruling
in
advance
that
i'm
not
going
to
violate
the
injunction.
you've
got
a
cheap
lawsuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is...
is
the
troll
the
scary
thing
under
the
bridge,
or
is
it
a
fishing
technique?
i...
i
want--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
is
that
what
the
troll
is?
