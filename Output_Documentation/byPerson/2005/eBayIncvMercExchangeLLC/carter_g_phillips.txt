mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
fundamental
question
that's
posed
in
this
particular
case
is
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
by
adopting
a
rule
that
declares
categorically
that
three
out
of
the
four
traditional
factors
for
deciding
whether
or
not
to
grant
permanent
injunctive
relief
will
be
irrebuttably
presumed
to
be
satisfied
whenever
a
jury
has
found
that
a
patent
is
valid
and
has
been
infringed.
the
rule
in
the
federal
circuit
for
at
least
20
years
has
been
that
if
you
have
validity
and
infringement
decided
by
the
jury,
that
then
there
is
irrebuttable
finding
of...
of
irreparable
injury,
of
inadequate
remedy
at
law,
and
that
the
balance
of
harms
decidedly
favors
the
plaintiff,
and
that
the
only
issue
that
remains
available
to
the
defendant
in
that
circumstance
is
a
heightened
scrutiny
on
the
standard
of
whether
or
not
the...
the
public
interest
commands
that
an
injunction
be
denied
in
a
particular
case.
and
even
in
that
context,
the
federal
circuit's
rule
is
extraordinarily
stringent
because
not
just
any
public
interest
can...
will
satisfy,
but
instead,
it
has
to
be
a
public
interest
that
endangers
the
public
health.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that...
that
is
precise...
i
think
it's
the
only
way
to
read
judge
bryson's
decision,
justice
ginsburg,
where
the
court
says,
at
page
26a,
that
a
permanent
injunction
will
issue
once
infringement
and
validity
have
been
adjudged,
and
then
say,
to
be
sure,
it
will
not
be
so
to
protect
the
public
interest.
and
we
all
know
the
traditional
rule
with
respect
to
the
grant
of
injunctive
relief
is
that
it's
a
four
factor
test.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
point
is
that
if
an
injunction
follows
with
a
finding
of...
of
validity
and
infringement,
then
that
means
that
there
has
to
be...
there
has
to
be
irreparable
injury,
inadequate
remedy
at
law,
and
that
the
balance
of
hardships
has
to
tilt
in...
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
and
then
the
only
issue
that
remains
is
whether
or
not
the
public
interest
justifies
not
granting
an
injunction
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
other
way
to
read
that.
and
if
you
read
it
in
the
context
of
the...
of
the
previous
20
years
of
decisions
from
the
federal
circuit,
it
is
absolutely
clear.
we
don't
have
the
opportunity
to
come
back
as
a
defendant
in
an
infringement
action
and
say,
your
honor,
in
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
this
is
someone
for
whom
money
damages
is
a
completely
adequate
remedy.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
section
283
is
designed
to
be
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
way
the
federal
circuit
has
interpreted
this...
this
scheme.
section
283
says
explicitly...
and
this
is
at
page
1
of
the
blue
brief...
district
courts,
quote,
may...
not
shall...
grant
injunctions
in
accordance
with
principles
of
equity.
and
principles
of
equity,
as
justice
story
said
almost
200
years
ago,
systematically
reject
the
idea
that
you
will
act
on
a
categorical
basis
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
grant
or
withdraw
the
injunctive
relief
in...
in
particular
circumstances.
and
to
the
contrary,
you
have
to
look
at
each
specific
issue.
and
in
that
regard--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
and...
and
congress
already
made
the...
the
balance,
justice
scalia,
with
respect
to
that
because
congress
obviously
identified
the
property
right
as
the
right
to
exclude.
and
then
congress
did
not
confer
upon
the
district
courts
no
discretion
to
act
in...
in
a
situation
where
the
property
right
has
been
violated.
instead,
congress
expressly
adopts
in
283
a
very
broad
grant
of
equitable
discretion.
to
be
sure,
in
the
ordinary
case,
you...
you
very
well
may
have
irreparable
injury
proved,
but
the
question
is,
do
you...
do
you
eliminate
any
inquiry
and
any
specific
facts
of
the
case
and
instead
not
only
presume
it,
which
i
think
is
a
mistake,
although
the
district
court
did
that
and
found
that
in
this
case
the
presumption
was
rebutted,
but
to...
but
to
say
irrebuttably
it's
presumed
that
you
have
irreparable
injury,
irrebuttably
presumed
that
you
don't
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
and
irrebuttably
presume
that
the
balance
of
equities
tilt
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
cannot
be
squared
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
and,
indeed,
on
that
score,
the
united
states
sort
of
magically
ends
up
on
our
side
of
the...
of
the
table
because
the
united
states
says
the
same
thing.
there
is
no
way--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
know
of
any.
i
mean,
i
certainly
wouldn't
categorically
declare
that
you
have
to
i
guess
is
the
way
i
would
respond
to
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
precisely
what
this
case
involves.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
know
that
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
them
like
that,
but
the
one
thing
that...
i
mean,
there
are
two
things
to
think
about
the
property
concept
in
the
statute.
first
of
all,
congress
does
not
declare
that
the
property
interest
here
is
a
real
property
interest,
which
traditionally
has
been
protected
differently.
it's
a
personal
property
interest,
which
is
traditionally
given...
accorded
less
protection
under
this
kind
of
a
scheme.
and
so
there...
and...
and
again,
congress
in
any
event
struck
the
balance.
it
didn't
say,
as
it
could
have,
that
there
is
presumed...
there's
a
presumption
that
we
have
an
injunction.
it
didn't
say,
as
it
could
have,
that
we
shall
have
a...
shall
have
either
a
presumption
or
an
injunction
in
any
particular
case.
and
so
under
the
statutory
scheme
here,
it
seems
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
in
those
cases,
the
irreparable
injury
and
the
inadequacy
of
the
remedy
at
law
will
be...
will
be
easy
to
demonstrate,
as
they
have
been
for
hundreds
of
years.
the...
the
fundamental
difference...
this
is
important
to
have
this
in
mind.
the
federal
circuit
adopted
this
rule
of
law
some
20
years
ago.
that's
before
the
high
tech
boom,
before
the
explosion
in
the
number
of
patents.
and
so
the
opportunity
to
deal
with
these
issues
on
an
individualized
basis
that
might
give
rise
to
some
kinds
of
rules
that
you
could,
in
fact,
apply
to
the
generality
of
cases
based
on
an
experience
has
never
been
there.
we
have
been
dealing
with
an
irrebuttable
presumption
for
20
years
in
a
way
that
has...
has
completely
stultified
the
ability
to
develop
any
of
those
kinds
of
rules.
and
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
at
this
point
is
to
say,
no,
enough
is
enough.
we
need
to
go
back
to
a
time
where
the...
go
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
confer
the
discretion
on
the
district
courts.
and
it's
important
not
just
for
a
case
like
this
one,
but
it...
but
it
distorts
tremendously
the
settlement
value
and
the
process
and
the
relationship
between
the
patent
holder
and
all
of
the
potential
licensees
because
we're
in
a...
in
a
world...
and
i
don't
think
the
court
can
ignore
this
because
it's
in
the
amicus
briefs.
we're
in
a
world
where
if
a
patent
holder
files
a
lawsuit
in
marshall,
texas,
no
patent
has
ever
been
declared
invalid
in
that
jurisdiction,
and
no
patent
has
never
been
found
not
to
infringe.
and
then
you
take
that
finding
automatically
and
you
turn
it
into
an
injunction.
any
person
who
has
been
threatened
under
those
circumstances
and
told
that
we're
going
to
face
a
lawsuit
in
marshall,
texas
is
going
to
have
a
very
different
negotiating
posture
than
in
a
situation
where--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
hope
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
the...
the
market
will
take
care
of
the
problem.
the
question
is
under
what
standards
are
you
going
to
apply.
are
you
going
to
say
that
there
is
no
effective
check
on
the
jury
system,
that
it
goes
automatically
from
a
jury's
finding
to
injunctive
relief,
or
are
you
going
to
implement
it
against
the
backdrop
of
what
congress
specifically
provides,
which
is
that
the
district
courts
should
exercise
equitable
discretion
in
deciding
how
best
to
proceed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but,
justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
problem
with
that
is
that
that's
not
the
scheme
that
congress
created
with
respect
to
the
remedial
aspects
of...
of
the
patent
laws.
i
mean,
it
is
surely
the
case
that
congress
meant,
as...
as
substantive
patent
law
is
generally
enforced
and
implemented,
that
the
federal
circuit
would
play
a
significant
role
in
ensuring
some
kind
of
uniformity,
but
congress
didn't
then
go
the
extra
step
and
say,
and
when
it
comes
time
to
decide
whether
or
not
injunctive
relief
ought
to
be
granted,
that
it
will...
that
we
will
presume
it
or
that
we
will
deal
with
it
in
a
categorical
way.
congress
granted
that
discretion
to
the
district
courts
and
with
good
reason
because
district--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
know
that
i
need
a
wide
ranging
allowance
with
respect
to
this.
what
i
need
is
elimination
of
the
irrebuttable
presumption
that
doesn't
allow
any
consideration
of
whether
money
damages
are
adequate
in
a
particular
case.
and...
and
here,
it's
very
important
to
focus.
the...
the
district
judge
didn't
just
say,
i
woke
up
this
morning
and
i
felt
really
good
about
the
defendant,
and
therefore,
i'm
not
granting
an
injunction.
the
district
court
here
said,
i'm
making
specific
findings
of
fact
with
regard
to
the
adequacy
of
money
damages
to
deal--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
that's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's...
that's
not
precisely
what
he
said,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
he
said
was
that
business
method
patents
stand
on
a
somewhat
different
footing
because
they're
subject--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
probably,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
wouldn't
be,
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
he
did
that
in
the
context
of
analyzing
the
public
interest
consideration
and
he
said
that
didn't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--tilt
in
favor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
should
know
that
actually,
but--
[laughter]
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
i...
i
think
you
can...
it's...
it's
not
fair
to
pick
apart
each
one
of
his
findings
and
say
does
that
finding
enough
or
is
that
finding
enough.
the
truth
is
the
district
court
made
a
series
of
four
findings
that
overlap,
and
one
of
which
was,
obviously,
he
doesn't...
he
doesn't
practice
his
patent.
he
also
doesn't
effectively
license.
he's
willing
to
license
his
patent
to
ebay.
he's
willing
to
license
this
patent
to
anybody
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
candidly,
most
of
the
licensing
arrangements
don't
even
exist,
and
they're...
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i...
i
think
in...
in
a
proper
case...
and
i
don't
think
you
can
do
it
under
the...
under
the
public
interest
analysis.
i
think
you'd
probably
end
up
doing
it
under
the
balance
of
the
hardships.
but
in
any
event...
and...
and
what
you...
you
know,
obviously,
this
case
is...
is
more
complicated
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i...
i
mean,
there's
plenty
left
because
he
doesn't
practice
this
invention.
he
has
no
intention
of
practicing
this
invention
beyond
the
receipt
of
money.
money
damages
are
a
completely
adequate
remedy
under
these
particular
circumstances,
given...
given
especially
the
fact
that
if...
if
the
infringement
continues...
and
remember,
this
is
not
a
situation
where
he
proposes
to
continue
to
infringe.
we
propose
to
work
around
it,
but
if
the
infringement
continues,
we're
then
subject
to
enhanced
damages
and
all
of
the
deterrent
power
that
that
has,
plus
the
possibility,
obviously,
down
the
road
that
the
district
court
could,
on
a
rule
54
motion,
now
come
back
and
say,
well,
no,
now
i've
decided
that
injunctive
relief
is
warranted
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
but
we're
not
asking
for
a
compulsory
license
because
it
is
not
our
intention,
going
forward,
to
infringe
this
patent.
we've
made
it
very
clear
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
recognizes
that
we
not
only
intend
to
but
have,
in
fact,
implemented
a
design
around
or
a
work
around
to
this
particular
patent.
and
that's
what
we
expect
will
happen.
so
we're
not
asking
for
the
right
to
continue
to
infringe
and
the
willingness
to
pay
as
we
go.
our
concern...
and
this
does
go
to
the
business
method
patent
because
it
does
go
to
the...
to
the
uncertainty.
the
problem
we
have
here
is
we
don't
know
where
the
line
is
going
to
be
drawn.
that's
why
the
district
court
said
specifically,
you
know,
there's
going
to
be
unending
litigation
on
this
because
it's
very
difficult
to
define
the
metes
and
bounds
of
this
particular
patent,
and
we're
going
to
have
to
fight
over
that,
so
that
the
traditional
reason
for
injunctive
relief,
which
is
to
bring
peace,
isn't
available
in
this
case.
we're
not
going
to
have
peace
under
these
circumstances.
and
when
you
have
that
situation
and
you
have
the
kind
of
uncertainty,
not
because
of
business
method
patents
generally...
that's...
that's
where
i
was
i
think
probably
giving
up
too
much
immediately.
i
don't
think
the
fact
of
a
business
method
patent
is
per
se
a
problem,
but
i
think
analyzing
the
specific
business
method
patent
and
its
uncertainty
is
a
legitimate
consideration
for
the
district
court
to
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
or
not,
in
a
particular
circumstance,
we
are
better
off
saying,
pay
the
plaintiff
the
money
for
the
past
injury,
let's
see
how
the
work
around
develops,
and
take
it
into
account,
but
without
the
sort
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
of
course,
the
consequences
of
the...
of
the
process
are
significantly
different
because,
obviously,
the
remedies
for...
for
contempt
are
significantly
more
draconian
than...
than
just
a
finding
of
a...
of
a
violation.
but
more...
more
important
than
that,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
and
the
reality
is
the
district
court
already
looked
at
this
and
said
that
it...
it
is
the
district
court's
judgment
that
they're
going
to
require
full
infringement
trials.
i
mean,
that
was
the
finding
it
made
with
respect
to
the
balance
of
hardships.
and...
and
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the...
nor
the
respondent
in
this
case
has...
has
challenged
that
particular
finding.
so
the
reality
is
the
district
court
has
made
the
determination
that
that's
not...
that
process
is
either
not
available
or
not
practical
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case,
which
of
course,
goes
back
to
why
it's
important
to
make
sure
that
you
look
at
each
of
these
cases
on
their
individual
facts
rather
than
across
the
board
on
a...
on
these...
on
an
irrebuttable
presumption
basis.
the...
the
additional
point
that
i
think
it's
important
i
at
least
spend
a
minute
on,
because
the
court
asked
for
us
to
deal
with
continental
paper
bag,
is
that
it
does
seem
to
me
quite
clear
that,
at
least
at
this
stage,
the
parties
are
pretty
much
in
sync,
that...
that
the
court
need
not
revisit
continental
paper
bag.
the
holding
in
that
case
is
actually
almost
a
sort
of
quintessential
situation
where
you
have
two
participants
in
the
market,
one
of
whom
would
like
to
take
advantage
of
a
patent
that
will
improve
that
participant's
ability
to
produce
a
product.
the
patent
holder
is
not
ready
yet
to
develop
that
product
using
that
particular
method
and,
therefore,
sues
to
stop
his
competitor
from
entering
into
that
market.
i
mean,
that's
the
classic
kind
of
situation
where
you
have
a...
you
know,
where
you...
where
you've
got
the
potential
infringer
is
looking
at
what's
going
on
and
making
a
decision
and
copying
it
and
then
trying
to
implement
it.
and
the
court
said,
under
those
circumstances,
you
get
an
injunction.
but
here,
of
course,
we're
dealing
with
a
vastly
different
situation,
as
we...
as
we
point
out
that...
in
our
brief,
where
the...
at
page
9
where
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
not
any
of
ebay's
success
is
attributable
to
anything
in
the
patents
of
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
and
that
nothing
in
the
patents
that
were
put
forward
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
provide
any
basis
on
which
anyone
could
build
a
business
model.
so
this
is,
to
my
mind,
the
antithesis
of
the
situation
in
continental
paper
bag.
but
in
any
event,
the
holding
there
is
clearly
not
implicated
here.
it's
been
codified
by
congress.
there's
no
basis
for
the
court
to
reconsider
it.
to
the
extent
that
there
is...
is
dicta
in
there
that
talks
about
the
right
to
exclude,
justice
scalia,
i
think,
in
general,
the
right
to
exclude
is
one
that
you
do,
in
fact,
enforce
with
injunctive
relief
in
many
cases,
but
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
circuit
should
have
adopted
a
rule
that
says
you...
you
enforce
it
in
every
case
irrebuttably
as
to
three
of
the
four
factors,
and
as
to
the
fourth
factor,
you
don't
go
any
further
than
requiring
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
there's
a...
an
imminent
public
health
crisis.
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
should
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
and,
indeed,
if
there
were
ever
a
case
in
which
the
court
ought
to
uphold
the
district
court
on
a...
under
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
it
is
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the...
because
congress
didn't
dictate
that
he
gets
that
leverage
in
every
situation.
and...
and
it's
quite
possible
that
the...
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
situations.
and
the
solicitor
general's
brief
identifies
four
of
them
in
which
an
inventor,
who
doesn't
plan
to
practice
the
invention,
engages
in...
in
various
kinds
of
licensing
schemes
that
create
all
kinds
of
interrelationships
among
the
way
the
patent
is
going
to
be
developed,
and
i
think
all
of
those
are
perfectly
legitimate
and
could
easily
justify
injunctive
relief
in
precisely
the
kind
of
case
that
you
pose,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
again,
you've
licensed
it
and
there
are
certain
rights
that,
obviously,
arise
out
of
the
licensing.
none
of
these
factors
is
alone,
i
don't
believe,
sufficient
to
say
you
don't
get
injunctive
relief.
but
i
think
what
the
district
court
said,
and
i
think
that
this
is
why
the
court
ought
to
affirm
the
district
court's
under...
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
which
never
been
applied
to
this
case...
what
the
court
should
say
is,
look,
and
where
you
have
no
practicing
of
the
invention
by
the
inventor,
where
you
have
a
complete
willingness
to
license
not
only
to
the
world,
but
also
to
ebay
specifically,
and
where
you've
never
sought
preliminary
injunctive
relief,
under
all
of
those...
and
where...
and
where
there's
serious
question
about
the
lines
to
be
drawn,
there's
no
benefit
to
be
had
by...
in
the
way
of
trying
to
eliminate
the
amount
of
litigation
on
an
ongoing
basis,
under
all
of
those
circumstances,
all
of
which
the
district
court
identified,
then
it's
not
appropriate
to
grant
injunctive
relief.
we'll
allow
enhanced
damages
in
the
interim
and
even
the
potential
down
the
road,
obviously,
of...
of
an
injunction
to
serve
as
enough
of
a
deterrent
to
protect
the
right
to
exclude
that
the
plaintiff
has
under
the
statute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
think...
i
think
i
ought
to
modify
it
slightly
because
it's
not
just
simply
that
you
don't
practice
the
invention.
it's
that
you're
not
in
the
market
itself
because
that's...
that's
the
continental
paper
bag
case.
you
know,
in
continental
paper
bag,
they
don't
want
to...
they
don't
want
to
practice
the
invention
either
because
they
want
to
hold
it
back
in
order
to
be
able
effectively
to
use
it.
if
they
had
wanted
to
license
it,
that
would
have
made
sense
too.
but
this
is
not
a
competitor
in
the
market.
if
they
were
a...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
much
better
claim
to
a
need
to
occupy
space.
that's
what
the
injunction
is
trying
to
say.
this
is
my
space.
i
want
to
occupy
it.
but
if
you
choose
not
to
occupy
it,
it's
not
to
say
that
you
abandon
your
right
to
an
injunction,
but
that
that
ought
to
be
a
legitimate,
individualized
consideration,
among
other
considerations--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
if
you
didn't
license
it...
and
actually
we
have
no
relevant
licenses
here
too...
that
would
be
another
factor
that
ought
to
be...
that
ought
to
count
in
the
mix.
again,
it's
not...
i'm
not
looking
for
a
presumption
the
other
way
and
i'm
not
looking
for
categorical
rules
that
say
that
if
you...
if
you're
a
nonperforming
entity,
that
you
don't
get
a
license,
or
even
if
you're
a
troll,
as
that
term
gets
bandied
around,
that
you're
never
entitled
to
a...
to
an
injunction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
for
my
clients,
it's
been
the
scary
thing
under
the
bridge,
but--
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
believe
that's
the...
i
think
that's
what...
what
it
is,
although
you...
maybe
we
should
think
of
it
more
as
orks,
now
that
we
have
a
new
generation,
but
at
this
point
troll
is
the
word
that
gets...
that
gets
used.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honors.
