chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
ebay
v.
mercexchange.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but...
but
the
exercise
of
discretion
is
channeled
over
time,
as...
as
judges
apply
it
in...
in
similar
cases.
you're
not
suggesting
that
in
a
typical
run
of
the
mine
patent
case,
no
special
considerations,
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
in
those
cases
you
typically
would
grant
an
injunction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
he
said
other
things
too,
and
one
thing
he
said
is,
i
don't
like
business
method
patents
very
much,
and
so
i'm
not
going
to
give
an
injunction
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
that
was
proper
or
improper?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
said
there's
a
growing
concern
over
the
issuance
of
business
method
patents.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
an
appropriate
consideration
to
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
to
grant
an
injunction
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
he
went
on
and
he
said--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--another...
another
consideration
is
that
this
patentee
does
not
practice
its
patents.
but,
i
mean,
isn't
that
just
saying
he's,
you
know,
the...
the
guy
in
the
garage
and
he's
an
inventor
and
the
way
he's
going
to
market
his
discoveries
is
by
getting
some
firm
that
basically
speculates
on
patents.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
he's
denying
that
inventor,
you
know,
the...
what
he'd
give
to
bell
labs...
or
whatever
bell
labs
is
these
days...
that
does
practice
the
inventions--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--why
should
we...
if
i
can
get
back
to
one
of
the
factors.
why
should
we
draw
a
distinction
between
the...
the
sole
inventor
who
needs
a
patent
speculation
firm
to
market
his
discovery
and...
and
somebody
else?
why...
why
should
he
lose
the
leverage
of
the
normal
injunction
and
have
substituted
for
that
a
duel
of
experts
over
what
a
reasonable
royalty
should
be?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i...
maybe
i
don't
understand
what
it
means
to
practice
the
invention.
if...
if
i...
does
that...
if...
if
i
invent
something,
you
know,
a
new...
better
way
to
make
a
car
engine
work
and
i
want
to
sell
that
to
somebody,
that's...
you'd
say
that's
not
practicing
the
invention
because
i
don't
build
cars?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
think
mr....
you
don't
think
judge
bryson
forgot
about
the
four
factor
test,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
and...
and
he
was
just
reflecting
the
reality
that
in
a
typical
case,
this
is
what
happens.
it
seems
to
me
all
you
want
us
to
do
is
edit
his
opinion
and
stick
in
this
formulaic
paragraph
about
there
are
four
factors
and
here
they
are.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
about
one
factor
in
particular?
justice
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
in
05-130,
ebay,
incorporated,
v.
mercexchange.
