justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
petitioners
ebay
and
half.com
operate
internet
websites
that
allow
private
sellers
to
list
goods
that
they
wish
to
sell.
respondent
mercexchange
holds
a
business-method
patent
for
an
electronic
market
designed
to
facilitate
the
sale
of
goods
between
private
individuals.
mercexchange
sought
to
license
its
patent
to
ebay
and
half.com,
but
the
parties
failed
to
reach
an
agreement.
as
a
result,
mercexchange
filed
a
patent-infringement
suit
against
ebay
and
half.com
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
a
jury
found
that
mercexchange’s
patent
was
valid,
that
ebay
and
half.com
had
infringed
that
patent
and
that
an
award
of
damages
was
appropriate.
the
district
court
then
denied
mercexchange’s
motion
for
permanent
injunction
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
reversed,
applying
its
general
rule
that
a
permanent
injunction
should
issue
upon
a
finding
of
patent
infringement
absent
exceptional
circumstances.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
the
appropriateness
of
this
general
rule.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
ordinarily,
a
federal
court
considering
whether
to
award
permanent
injunctive
relief
to
a
prevailing
plaintiff
applies
the
four-factor
test
historically
employed
by
courts
of
equity.
a
plaintiff
must
demonstrate,
one,
that
it
has
suffered
an
irreparable
injury;
two,
that
remedies
available
at
law,
such
as
monetary
damages,
are
inadequate
to
compensate
for
that
injury;
three,
that
considering
the
balance
of
hardships
between
the
plaintiff
and
defendant,
a
remedy
in
equity
is
warranted;
and,
four,
that
the
public
interest
would
not
be
disserved
by
a
permanent
injunction.
the
decision
to
grant
or
deny
permanent
injunctive
relief
is
an
act
of
equitable
discretion
by
the
district
court,
reviewable
on
appeal
for
abuse
of
discretion.
we
conclude
that
these
familiar
principles
apply
with
equal
force
to
disputes
arising
under
the
patent
act.
nothing
in
the
patent
act
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
depart
from
the
long
tradition
of
equity
practice.
to
the
contrary,
the
patent
act
expressly
provides
that
injunctions
may
issue
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
equity.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
below
fairly
applied
these
traditional
equitable
principles
in
deciding
respondent’s
motion
for
a
permanent
injunction.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
so
that
the
district
court
may
apply
that
framework
in
the
first
instance.
in
doing
so,
we
take
no
position
on
whether
permanent
injunctive
relief
should
or
should
not
issue
in
this
particular
case,
or
indeed
in
any
number
of
other
disputes
arising
under
the
patent
act.
we
hold
only
that
the
decision
whether
to
grant
or
deny
injunctive
relief
rests
within
the
equitable
discretion
of
the
district
courts
and
that
such
discretion
must
be
exercised
consistent
with
traditional
principles
of
equity
in
patent
disputes
no
less
than
in
other
cases
governed
by
such
standards.
this
decision
is
unanimous.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
joined
by
justices
scalia
and
ginsberg.
justice
kennedy
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
joined
by
justices
stevens,
souter
and
breyer.
