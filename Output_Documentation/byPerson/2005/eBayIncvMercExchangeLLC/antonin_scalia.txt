justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is
that
so
with...
with
respect
to
someone
else's
use
of...
of
your
property?
it
seems
to
me
very
rare
where...
where
someone
takes
your
property,
that
the
court
wouldn't...
wouldn't
give
you
the
property
back
and...
and
simply
say,
you
know...
i
can
think
of
a
few
extraordinary
examples.
if
somebody
makes
a
statue
out
of
stolen
gold,
you
know,
the...
the
old
classic,
i
guess
you'd
get
the
money
back.
but
ordinarily
we're
talking
about
a
property
right
here,
and...
and
the
property
right
is...
is
explicitly
the
right
to
exclude
others
from...
from
use
of
that.
that's
what
the
patent
right
is.
and
all
he's
asking
for
is
give
me
my
property
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
mean,
that's...
that's
a
problem
with
marshall,
texas,
not
with
the
patent
law.
i
mean,
maybe...
maybe
we
should
remedy
that
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
think
we
should
write...
write
our
patent
law
because
we
have
some
renegade
jurisdictions.
why...
why
isn't
the...
the
free
market
normally
adequate
to
solve
any
problems
you're
talking
about?
everybody
is
in
this
for
the
money.
nobody
is
going
to
hold
off
giving
the
license
beyond
the
point
where...
where
it
makes
financial
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't...
why
can't
we
let
the
market
take
care
of
the
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
maybe
you
exaggerate
the...
the
extent
of
equitable
discretion.
i
mean,
it
wasn't
as
though
it's
just
left
up
to
the
judge,
seems
like
a
good
idea
or
not
a
good
idea.
there
are
a
lot
of
rules
for
when...
when
you
would
give
injunctive
relief
and
not.
and...
and
i...
you
know,
i'm
not
sure
you're
going
to
get
into
the
kind
of
wide
ranging
allowance
that...
that
you
seem
to
be
arguing
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
does
the
fact
that...
that
you're
not
practicing
the
invention
make
a
difference?
i
mean,
why...
why
should
i
be
in
better
shape,
as
far
as
getting
an
injunction
is
concerned,
if
i
produce
an
automobile
engine
and...
and
make
some
undeterminate
profit--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
the
use
of
this
particular
invention
in
the
engine
than
i
would
be
if
i
licensed
it
with
a
royalty
based
upon
the
number
of
sales
of
engines?
i
mean,
they're
both
risking,
you
know,
the
same
future
use
of
the...
of
the
device.
why...
why
does
one
situation
justify
an
injunction
more
than
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
not
occupying
it,
you
mean
including
not
licensing
it
to
somebody
else.
