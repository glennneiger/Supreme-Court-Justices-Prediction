mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
for
two
reasons,
one
of
which
responds
to
a
question
that
the
chief
justice
has,
and
that
is
that
lincoln
property
company
was
not
a
real
party
to
the
controversy.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
was
not
a
real
party
to
the
controversy.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
trial
counsel
named
it,
because
that
was
the
understanding
that
he
had.
it
turned
out,
as
lincoln
proved
on
remand,
that
it
had
abandoned
the
apartment
management
business
in
1991.
and
that's
at
page
239
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
you're
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
because
lincoln
said
that
it
was
the
manager.
lincoln,
in
its
answer,
paragraphs
13,
paragraph
36,
paragraph
5,
said
that
it
was
the
real
party
in
interest,
when,
in
fact,
it
was
not.
and
that's
what's
led
to
the
problem
that
we
find
ourselves
in,
because
when
you
have
a
non
real
party
to
the
controversy,
jurisdiction
is
determined
by
the
salient
jurisdictional--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor,
that
is--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--we
didn't
sue
b.
we
didn't
know
b
existed.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor,
lincoln
represented
to
the
public
and
to
the
court
that
it
was,
in
fact,
the
manager.
discovery
was,
in
fact,
served
that
would
have
adduced
this
information.
this
issue
came
up
in
the
reply
brief,
so
it's
not
addressed
in
our
brief,
but
if
any
of
your
clerks
would
care
to
look
at
the
fourth
circuit's
supplemental
appendix,
it--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--you
read
that
absolutely
correctly.
there--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--are
other--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--there
are...
there
is
other
evidence
on
that
issue,
which
i
believe
is
a
distinct
issue,
but
let
me
address
that
issue.
in
lawyer
prepared
documents
that
were
submitted
specifically
to
rule
26(a)(1)
disclosures
and
the...
and
the
supplemental
interrogatory
answers,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
it
was
lawyers
that
identified
mr.
franzen
as
a
senior
vice
president
and
partner
of
lincoln
property
company,
raising
an
issue--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--on
page
179
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor,
in
lincoln's
supplemental
answers
to
interrogatories,
mr.
franzen
is
identified
in
this
affirmation
as
a
senior
vice
president
and
partner
of
lincoln
property
company.
as
i
said,
there
are
two
issues.
what
is
lincoln's
characterization?
on
the
next
page,
page
181,
in
the
supplemental
initial
disclosures,
mr.
franzen
is
again,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
identified
as
a
partner
of
lincoln
property
company.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
i'm
sorry,
that--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--that
was
joint
appendix,
page
181.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
181,
your
honor.
the
prior
one
was
179.
there
was--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor,
that
evidence
was
also
in
the
record.
the
fourth
circuit
was
not
comfortable
that
mr.
franzen
was
being
entirely
candid
by
not
identifying
which
partnerships,
in
fact,
he
was
involved
in.
and
i
would
note,
your
honor,
that
this
paragraph
does
not
identify
any
entity
that
actually
managed
the
apartment
building.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
correct.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
cite
two
cases,
in
particular,
for
a
real
party
to
the
controversy
defendant,
where
his
citizenship
is
disregarded,
even
though
he's
named
barney
versus
city
of
baltimore,
73
u.s.
580,
and
little
against
giles,
118
u.s.
596.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
that
is
the
issue
that
we
find
in
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
lincoln
property
company
was
a
nominal
defendant.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor,
they
defended
the
case.
and
we'd
submit
that,
on
the
basis
of
barney
and
little,
that
what
one
does...
on
the
basis
of
the
state
highway
commission
case,
when
you
have
someone
who
is
serving
as
a
surrogate
for
another,
you
look
to
the
jurisdictional
characteristics
of
the
other;
otherwise,
he
can,
by
coming
in
to
defend,
obtain
a
federal
forum
to
which
he
is
otherwise
not
entitled.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
it--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor,
it
was
definitely
a
party
to
the
controversy.
we
believe
that
the
point
of
the
"real
party
to
the
controversy"
doctrine
is
that
every
party
doesn't
fall
in
that
category,
and
that
is
what
the
focus--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--understood.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor,
the
facts,
as
you've
stated
them,
i
believe,
are
not
the
facts
in
this
record.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
and
let
me
explain.
it's
certainly
true
that
lincoln
identifies,
at
page
96
of
the
cert
petition
appendix,
a
chart
of
entities
that
are
salient.
the
most
notable
omission
from
the
chart
is
the
relationship
of
any
of
those
entities
to
lincoln.
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
what...
how
attenuated
that
was
or
what
the
relationship
is,
what
indemnities
existed,
or
whether
lincoln
actually
had
an
interest
in
this
outcome.
they
now
rely
on
an
agency
theory.
that
isn't
how
the
case
was
defended.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
well,
let
me
try
to
make
it
less
bizarre,
your
honor.
what
we're
saying
is,
for
example,
if
i
had
a
dispute
with
john
smith,
the
son,
who's
not
diverse,
but
i
accidentally
sue
john
smith,
the
father,
who
is
diverse,
and
he
comes
in...
he
removes,
and
he
comes
in
to
defend,
on
the
merits,
that
he
is
not
a
real
party
to
that
controversy,
and
that
his
citizenship,
under
the
opinions
of
this
court,
would
be
measured
by
that
of
the
son
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
federal
forum
is
appropriate--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--it's
one
thing--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor,
that
cannot
be
the
case,
or
the
"real
party
to
the
controversy"
case
means
that
every
defendant
is
a
real
party.
and
it's
true,
in
this
sense,
that--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor,
it's
certainly
true
that
rule
17
only
deals
with
plaintiffs.
but
in
the
cases
we've
cited,
including
two
i
just
cited
today,
it
applies
to
defendants,
as
well,
because
rule
17
doesn't
confine
the
limits.
in
navarro,
the
court
said
that
it
articulates
the
same
principles,
but
it's
not
completely
congruent
with
the
"real
party
to
the
controversy"
test.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
exactly
right.
and
we're
talking
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
under
the
"real
party
to
the
controversy"
test.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
the
court's
opinion,
in
carden,
identified
"real
party
to
the
controversy"
doctrine
in
a
recent
example.
i
believe
it
was
mentioned
again
in
the
grupo
dataflux
opinion.
the
concept
is
that
the
real
parties
to
the
controversy
must
be
before
the
court.
and
to
respond
to
justice
scalia's--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--correct.
and
in...
it
identified--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--the
language
i'm
referring
to,
in
carden,
was
in
distinguishing
the
dissenting
opinion,
in
saying
that
if,
in
fact,
the
question
were,
which
of
the
parties
before
the
court
should
be
considered,
for
jurisdictional
purposes?
it
would
be
the
real
parties
to
the
controversy.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--we
did
argue,
and
we
do
argue,
that
the
fourth
circuit
could
reasonably
conclude,
on
burden
of
proof
grounds,
that
it
was
not
satisfied
that
the
texas
corporation
was
a
corporate
entity.
but
the
argument
that
i've
been
using--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor,
we're
not
abandoning
the
argument,
only
because
if
you
look
at
the
corporate
entity,
itself,
from
the
joint
appendix,
243,
it
began
as
lincoln
property
number
one.
if
we
then
look
at
the
yellow
brief,
in
the
addendum,
we
have
thousands
of
lincoln
entities.
we
have
no
doubt
there
is
a
corporation
that
is
a
texas
entity.
now,
our
argument
today
is
that
that
entity
could
not
step
in
the
shoes
of
another
potentially
non
diverse
entity
without
at
least
identifying
who
the...
what
the
jurisdictional
characteristics
of
that
entity
were.
agency
was
not
argued.
agency
was
not
argued
below.
lincoln
said
it
was
the
manager.
the
disparate
court
found,
in
three
opinions,
lincoln
was
the
manager.
the
plaintiffs
thought
they
were
suing
the
entity
managing
the
premises.
lincoln
was
not
that
entity.
it
had
abandoned
that
business.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor,
it
was
not
the
plaintiff's
choice.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--there
were
significant
tactical
advantages
to
lincoln,
whatever
its
relationship
with
these
entities,
in
being
in
federal
court.
the
plaintiff
preferred
a
state
court
venue
where
there
was
no
daubert
and
there
was
no
summary
judgment
permissible
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
and
deposition
testimony.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
let
me
attempt
to
articulate
a
proposition,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
when
jurisdiction
is
challenged,
the
party
asserting
jurisdiction,
seeking
the
federal
forum,
has
to
defend
it
by
proving
diversity
of
citizenship,
and
that
means
when
its
"real
party
to
the
controversy"
status
is
challenged,
it
has
to
adduce
sufficient
evidence
that
it
is,
indeed,
the
real
party
to
the
controversy.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
it
is
not
what
happened
here.
and
i
would
submit
to
you
it
is
not
what
happened
here,
because
of
a
lack
of
candor
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
ordinarily,
one
would
expect
the
defendant
to
say,
"not
me".
in
fact,
this
defendant
proceeded
to
litigate--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--they'd--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--and
that--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--by
no
means--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor.
and
that
was...
that
was
a
part
of
your
first
question,
which
i
want
to
respond
to.
anybody
who
is
a
non
real
party
to
the
controversy
finds
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
to
be
able
to
establish
that
it
is
not
the
party.
but
when
it
defends,
by
standing
in
the
shoes
as
a
surrogate
for
another
in
order
to
obtain
a
federal
forum,
the
jurisdictional
characteristics
of
that
party
are
not
germane.
it
is
the
jurisdictional
characteristics
of
the
party
in
whose
shoes
it
stands.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
that
is--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--interrogatory
number
3
in
the
fourth
circuit
supplemental
appendix,
at
page
35,
inquires
about
any
person,
which
is
defined
to
include
any
corporation
affiliate,
that
has
any
knowledge
of
the
tenancy
of
the
plaintiffs.
the
objections
are
not
in
the
record.
again,
this
issue
came
up
in
the
yellow
brief,
but
they
did
not
reply
to
that.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph

mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--of
the
tenancy
of
the--
mr.
gregory

--lease
relationship
of

roches
in
the
westfield
village
apartment--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--yes,
sir.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor,
we
acknowledge
there
is
a
texas
corporation.
we
sued
the
texas--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor,
we
do
not,
in
the
sense
that
we
accept
the
fourth
circuit's
determination
that
the
burden
of
proof
to
clarify
that
entity's
status,
and
the
germane
entity
status--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor,
what
we
say
is
that
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
there
was
insufficient--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--proof
of
that
point.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor,
we
do
not...
we
do
not
walk
away
from
the
fourth
circuit's
conclusion,
so
we...
we
know
there
is
a
texas
corporation.
we
don't
know
that
that
is--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--we
so
alleged,
and
they
said
yes.
so--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--it
is.
but
whether
or
not
that
is
the
entity,
we
can't
be
sure
of,
because--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--yes,
your
honor,
we'll--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--acknowledge
that--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--it
is...
the
burden
of
proof
failure
that
the
fourth
circuit
found
was
that
we
could
not--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--we
don't--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--we
do
not
have
the
answer
to
that
question.
and
that
was
the
fourth
circuit's
conclusion.
we
know
that
eqr
is
a
part
of
that.
and
that's
why...
they
put
in
an
affidavit
that
said
that
eqr
was
the
only
affiliate
of
lincoln
involved
in
the
management--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--and
that's
why
we--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--what
we
think,
your
honor,
is
that
they
did
not
prove
that
that
was
not
the
case,
and
the
burden
of
proof
to
sustain
jurisdiction
was
theirs.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
correct.
we
don't
know--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--who
it
is.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
we
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
that
is
the
burden
of
proof
failure
that
the
fourth
circuit
found.
but
the
real
estate
roundtable
brief,
at
page
11,
identifies
the
fact
that
it's
very
common
to
have
a
special
purpose
entity
that
is
property
specific,
which
gives
further
rise
to
that
inference.
but
it
is
a
failure
of
a
burden
of
proof
that
was
ultimately
found
by
the
fourth
circuit.
and
because
of
the
failure
of
the
burden
of
proof,
we're
not
in
a
position
to
identify
the
party.
had--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--justice
souter,
i
believe,
in
fairness
to
the
fourth
circuit,
on
page
16(a)
of
the
petition
appendix,
they
said
that
they
found
lincoln
to
be
a
nominal
defendant,
not
a
real
party
to
the
controversy.
in
that
case,
the
relevance
of
the
subsidiary
or
other
entity
was
to
determine
the
jurisdictional
characteristics.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
fourth
circuit
found
a
failure
of
the
burden
of
proof,
because
they
could
not
identify,
at
the
time
of
that
hearing,
who
was
the
appropriate
subsidiary
and
what
the
jurisdictional
characteristics
were.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
correct.
there's
no
dispute
that
if
lincoln
were
a
real
party
to
the
controversy,
they
don't
have
to
join
every
other
real
party
to
the
controversy.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
not
quite,
your
honor,
because
there's
still
the
burden
of
proof
issue.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
that
is
correct
only
if
your
honor
makes
that
determination
based
on
matters
that
were
before
the
fourth
circuit.
there
are
a
series
of
affidavits
they
rely
on
that
were
submitted
after
the
fourth
circuit's
determination
which
may
affect
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
lincoln
is
a
real
party
to
the
controversy.
specifically,
in
the
blue
brief,
in
footnote
9,
and
in
the
yellow
brief,
in
footnote
15,
they've
adduced
additional
evidence.
the
fourth
circuit
was
ruling
at
a
point
in
time
as
to
what
the
burden
of
proof
was.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
our
position.
and
the
reason
that's
not
our
position
is
that,
at
the
time
of
removal,
every
defendant
that
is,
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
diverse
has
the
ability
to
remove
in
order
to
defend
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
innocent...
the
innocence
grounds.
but
if
it
then
steps,
instead,
to
defend
the
merits
on
behalf
of
another
in
order
to
invoke
a
federal
forum...
instead
of
saying,
"not
me",
which
it
could
have
done,
but
did
not
do...
had
it
said,
"not
me",
then
the
plaintiff
would
have
known
that
it
should
be
looking
at
other
entities.
in
fact,
it
said
nothing
of
the
sort.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
that
is
the--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--entire
issue.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
and
they
clearly
were
a
party
to
the
controversy.
but
if
they
were
not
the
real
party
to
the
controversy,
they
managed,
perhaps,
to
acquire
a
federal
forum
by
virtue
of
stepping
into
the
shoes
of
the
subsidiaries.
and
that
is
the
argument,
that
if
they
are
not
the
real
party
to
the
controversy
because
they're
litigating
the
merits
on
behalf
of
another,
it's
the
jurisdictional
characteristics
of
the
other
that
are
germane,
and
that's
the
burden
of
proof
failure.
the
"real
party
to
the
controversy"
doctrine
is
not
a
new
doctrine
to
this
court.
it
goes
back
to
at
least
1809,
brown
against
strode.
i
mean,
the...
it
is
a
fundamental
doctrine.
and
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
it
goes
back
as
far,
perhaps,
as
1789,
to
the
assignee
clause
in
the
judiciary
act,
in
section--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--trial...
i
wasn't
trial
counsel,
your
honor.
trial
counsel
did,
in
the
fourth
circuit
supplemental
appendix,
at
pages
35
to
38,
make
inquiries.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
no,
and...
they
did
not...
and
i--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--your
honor,
he
didn't
think
it
was
the
wrong
person.
he
was
being
told
it
was
the
right
person,
and
shouldn't
be
faulted
for
lack
of
diligence
in
accepting
the
representations
that
they
had
the
right
person.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
but,
your
honor,
it
only
turned
out
at
the
end
that,
in
fact,
that
was
not
correct.
and
these
matters
snuck
in
through
discovery,
in
the
course
of--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--discovery
that
was
a
merits
discovery.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
your
honor,
there
was...
there
were
discovery
requests
served.
there
was
not
discovery
forthcoming
on
the
issue
of
affiliates.
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
is
the
reason--
mr.
gregory
p.
joseph
--there
is
no
doubt,
your
honor,
this
is
a
hail
mary
pass,
because
the
court
had
made
clear
what
its
decision
was
going
to
be.
but
hail
mary
passes
connect.
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
real
party
to
the
controversy
was,
in
fact,
litigating.
and
we
believe
that
it
was
not.
and
that...
we
basically
come
to
the
argument
that
limited
jurisdiction
means
the
limits
must
be
respected.
"real
party
to
the
controversy"
doctrine
is
an
established
limit.
there
are
federalism
issues
involved,
and
we
submit
that
the
fourth
circuit's
judgments
should
be
affirmed,
because
we
did
not
have
the
real
party
to
the
controversy.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
