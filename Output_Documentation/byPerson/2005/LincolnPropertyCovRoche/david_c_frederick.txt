mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
is
a
routine
diversity
case
that
went
seriously
awry
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
original
defendants
in...
named
in
the
complaint,
petitioners
state
of
wisconsin
investment
board,
which
i'll
refer
to
as
swib,
and
lincoln
property
company,
are
completely
proper
and
diverse
parties.
swib
owned
the
apartment
complex,
and
lincoln
managed
it
through
agents.
the
fourth
circuit,
nonetheless,
embarked
on
a
search
for
affiliates
of
lincoln
that
it
thought
would
be
more
appropriate
party
defendants,
what
the
court
deemed,
quote,
"real
parties
in
interest".
the
fourth
circuit's
holdings
are
fundamentally
flawed,
in
two
respects.
first,
because
the
named
defendants
are
proper
parties,
the
court
erred
in
holding
that
lincoln
had
not
carried
its
burden
of
proof
by
failing
to
establish
that
some
non
named
putative
defendants
might
possibly
destroy
complete
diversity,
and
that
the
remedy
for
such
a
possibility
was
dismissal
of
the
action
from
federal
court.
second,
the
court
erroneously
engrafted
a,
quote,
"very
close
nexus"
requirement
onto
the
test
for
require...
for
determining
the
citizenship
of
a
limited
partnership.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
issue,
a
number
of
black
letter
legal
principles
govern
a
court's
consideration
of
non
named
parties.
let's
start
with
the
statutory
text.
the
diversity
statute,
at
section
1332(a),
talks
about
civil
actions,
and
a
"civil
action"
is
defined
as
the
naming
of
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant.
a
civil
action
does
not
encompass
those
that
are
not
named
in
the
lawsuit.
that
language
is
tracked
in
the
removal
statute,
section
1441(a),
which
also
speaks
of
civil
actions,
and
in...
mirrored
in
1441(b),
which
says
that
a
defendant
may
remove,
where
it
is
properly
joined
and
served.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is,
justice
souter,
but
what...
my
argument
is
that
that
language,
properly
joined
and
served,
simply
tracks
the
civil
action
requirement
under
the
original
diversity
statute,
as
well
as
the
removal
provision
of
1441(a).
but
what
the
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
and
where
we
think
it
got
off
track,
was
it
took
the...
to...
the
phrase
"parties
in
interest",
and
it...
and
it
took
cases
from
this
court
that
have
used
the
phrase
"real
parties
in
interest"
to
determine
what
are
proper
party
plaintiffs,
and
it
used
that
concept
on
the
defendant's
side
of
the
ledger.
and
none
of
the
cases
from
this
court
talk
about
"real
parties
in
interest"
as
being
defendants.
the
explanation
given
by
the
court
for
doing
it
on
the
plaintiff's
side
is
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
is
not
going
to
be
subjected
to
multiple
suits.
but
there
are
many
purposes--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
phrase
"parties
in
interest"...
we
were
seeking
to
find
out
where
the
court
could
have
applied
that
phraseology
on
the
defendant's
side.
and
the
only
place
that
we
could
find,
in
the
statutes
or
the
rules,
was
in
1441(b)
and
the
explanation
for
removal,
that
we
were
not
a
"proper
party
in
interest".
and
that's
why
we
focused--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--there
are,
justice
ginsburg.
and
the
analysis
goes
to
whether
or
not...
how
far
along
in
the
proceeding
the
litigation
has
occurred
before
the
plaintiff
makes
that
choice.
of
course,
a
plaintiff
can
voluntarily
drop
defendants,
without
any
consequences,
and
the
courts
have
fairly
uniformly
held
that
it...
that
it
is
no
jurisdictional
bar
for
a
plaintiff
to
drop
a
non
diverse
defendant
in
order
to
ensure
that
diversity
would
be
present.
had
this
complaint
been
brought
in
federal
court,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
court
would
have
had
original
jurisdiction,
because,
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
the
two
named
defendants
were
completely
diverse.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
that
position
is
incorrect,
both
as
a
factual
matter
and
as
a
legal
matter.
as
a
factual
matter,
lincoln
is
a
completely
proper
party.
its
name
is
on
the
lease.
it
was
the
employer
of
mr.
roche,
who
was
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
suit.
it
issued
the
mold
policies
that
are
at
issue
in
the
case.
all
of
its
advertising
is
alleged
to
have
been
fraudulent
in
the
original
complaint.
and
it
was
the
director
and
manager
of
the
agents
whose
acts
were
alleged
to
have
been
negligent
here.
there's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no
question--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
mr.
chaney's
testimony
has
to
be
viewed
in
contact...
in
context,
justice
ginsburg.
he
was
not
called
as
a
30(b)(6)
witness
as
a
corporate...
for
a
corporate
form
and
structure.
the
testimony
that
was
being
elicited
was
to
see
whether
lincoln
had
other
entities
and
ownership
of
properties
in
virginia
so
that
they
could
attempt
to
prove
that
there
was
a
problem
that
the
parent
company,
lincoln
property
company,
knew
about.
there
was
a
high
degree
of
imprecision
in
the
deposition
questions,
and
it's
fairly
clear,
i
think,
that
the
lawyer
and
the
witness
did
not
understand
what
each
other
were
talking
about.
yet
in
the
discovery
process,
not
a
single
question
was
presented
that
would
get
at
the
organizational
structure
of
lincoln.
there
was
not
any
attempt
to
get
behind
the
management
documents
between
swib
and
lincoln
property.
it
was
one
very
small
snippet
of
a
deposition
which
has
been
taken
out
of
context
and,
we
would
submit,
blown
out
of
proportion
by
the
respondents
in
their
submissions
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
justice
ginsburg,
as
the
real
estate
roundtable
brief
demonstrates,
and
is
unrebutted,
the
real
estate
industry
operates
through
many
very
complicated
structures
for
perfectly
legitimate
finance
and
tax
related
reasons.
and
mr.
franzen
is
a
partner
in
some
deals,
but
the
testimony
that
was
provided
in
a
declaration...
and
it
is
appended
to
our
reply
brief...
demonstrates
that
mr.
franzen
was
not
a
partner
in
any
deal
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
westfield
village
apartments.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was,
it
erected
a
burden
of
proof
that
said
that
the
defendant
has
to
prove
a
negative,
that
there
is
not
some
affiliate
corporation
out
there
that
is
a
citizen
of
the
commonwealth
that
would
be
existing
to
destroy
diversity.
and
that
type
of
burden,
to
prove
a
negative,
has
never
been
authorized
in
this
court's
cases.
rather,
what
this
court's
cases
have
held
is
that,
as
the
masters
of
their
complaint,
plaintiffs
have
an
opportunity
to
plead
whichever
defendants
they
want
to
try
to
prove
their
allegations
against.
if
they
want
to
try
to
prove
federal
claims,
this
court
has
held
that
that
kind
of
case
can
be
removed.
if
it
wants
to
plead
around
federal
claims,
this
court's
cases
have
said
that
that
would
be
respected,
as
well.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
we
don't
think,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
"real
party
in
interest"
analysis
even
applies
on
the
defendant's
side,
but
it
is...
it
would
not
apply
to
this
extent.
it's
not
for
the
courts,
once
they
have
a
proper
defendant,
to
be
searching
outside
the
record
for
possible
jurisdictional
spoilers
once
jurisdiction
has
been
established.
and
this
court's
cases--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
they
do...
if
there
is
no
proper
defendant,
then
i
think--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
it--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
it
would
be
a
12(b)(6)
motion
to
dismiss,
where
there
is
no
defendant
who
would
liable
to
the
plaintiff.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
was,
it
imposed
an
obligation
on
the
defendants
that,
in
effect,
confuses
the
obligations
that
are
in
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
19,
which
looks
at
whether
there
are
necessary
or
indispensable
parties.
and
what
the
court
did
was,
in
effect,
to
take
an
unnamed
affiliated
entity
to
lincoln
and
treat
it
as
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--functional
equivalent
of
an--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
in
fact,
in
their
answer,
justice
stevens,
they
admitted
that
they
were
the
manager
of
the
apartment,
that
they
had
run
it
through
their
agents.
they
acknowledged
that
it
was
their
policies
that
were
in
effect.
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
basis
that
would
have
survived
rule
11
that
would
have
given
lincoln
property
company
a
basis
on
which
not
to
defend
the
lawsuit.
and
so,
to
that
extent,
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
they
are
a
proper
party
defendant.
we've
always
taken
the
position
that
if
we
are
found
liable,
we
would
pay
a
judgment.
the
issue
is
that
we
don't
think
we're
liable,
because
we
think
that
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
are
completely
baseless.
and
that's
what
the
district
court
found
when
it
held,
on
summary
judgment,
that
there
was
not
a
dispute
of
fact
as
to
the
core
allegations
of
the
complaint.
returning
to
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
about
rule
19,
there
is
a
mechanism
for
the
courts
to
consider
whether
there
are
indispensable
parties.
and
what
the
court
did
here
was
to
take
a
rule
19
kind
of
inquiry...
is
a
non
named
defendant
really
an
indispensable
party,
such
that
dismissal
of
the
action
is
warranted
+/?
and
to
engraft
that
onto
a
jurisdictional
inquiry.
but
the
reason
why
we
have
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
is,
of
course,
to
follow
them.
and
what
the
fourth
circuit
did
here
was,
it
took
that
kind
of
analysis,
but
it
didn't
follow
the
standards
that
the
courts
have
set
out
for
applying
rule
19
properly.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and,
justice
ginsburg,
they
never
sought
to
name
or
join
that
other
possible
defendant.
they
never
brought
a
joinder
motion.
they
never
even
conducted
discovery
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
another
possible
defendant
that
might
be
affiliated.
and
their
theory
of
liability
made
it
unnecessary,
because
their
theory
of
liability
was
that
lincoln
property
company,
the
parent,
is
responsible
for
all
the
acts
of
its
agents.
and
had
they
really
wanted
to
be
in
federal
court,
they
could
have
found
plenty
of
virginia
citizens
that
they
could
have
sued.
they
could
have
sued
the
plumber,
they
could
have
sued
the
installer
of
a...
heating
and
air
conditioning
equipment,
they
could
have
sued
the
general
contractors.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
they
could
have
sued
if
they
were
that
intent
on
staying
in
federal
court.
but,
instead,
they
made
a
tactical
choice
to
sue
the
deepest
pockets.
and
the
deepest
pockets
happened
to
be
out
of
state
citizens
that
have
a
right
under
the
statutes
to
remove
the
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
we
readily
satisfied
that,
both
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
which
identified
lincoln
property
company
as
a
texas
corporation,
and
in
the
remand
notice,
which
identified
its
principal
place
of
business
as
texas.
even
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
problem
calling
it
a
"texas
parent",
because
the
corporation
documents,
which
are
part
of
the
record,
amply
demonstrated
that
lincoln
property
company
is,
in
fact,
a
texas
corporation
and
satisfies
those
requisites
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction
provision.
the...
instead,
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
is
to
erect
a
standardless
forum
that
will
increase
litigation
over
jurisdiction
by
inviting
courts
to
make
inquiry
about
parties
and
entities
that
are
not
named
in
the
lawsuit,
solely
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
are
jurisdictional
spoilers.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
what
the
ninth
circuit,
in
a...
in
an
opinion
by
then
judge
kennedy
that
we
have
cited,
called
simpson...
said
you
respect
the
plaintiff's
allegations.
if
the
plaintiff
wants
to
sue
the
parent,
and
the
parent
is
an
out
of
state
corporation,
the
plaintiff
is
the
master
of
the
complaint.
and,
in
the
simpson
case,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
it
was
completely
proper
to
remain
in
federal
court,
even
though
it
was
obvious
to
all
that
there
was
a
subsidiary
that
was
an
in
state
subsidiary
that,
if
it
had
been
sued,
would
be
non
diverse.
so,
we
think
that's
the
proper
answer,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
if
i
could
turn
to
the
second
issue
that
we
have
prevented...
presented,
that
concerns
how
one
would
treat
eqr,
which
is
the
management
agent
of
lincoln
property
company.
we
read
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
as
engrafting
onto
this
court's
test
in
the
carden
case
an
additional
requirement
that,
in
addition
to
the
citizens
of--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
you
agree
with
us
on
question
one,
justice
ginsburg,
reversal
is
the
appropriate
disposition,
and
the
court
need
not
reach
question
two.
we
would
submit,
however,
that,
because
the
error
is
so
egregious
and
leads
to
the
difficulties
that
have
been
outlined
by
the
real
estate
roundtable
for
nationwide
business
entities,
that
the
court
certainly
ought
to
say
that
this
was
error,
as
well,
or
at
least
to
vacate
that
part
of
the
judgment,
as
well.
and
the
reason
is,
in
the
carden
case,
what
the
court
held
was
that
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
but
you--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--expressed
disapproval
with
this
very
close
nexus
standard
by
which
the
fourth
circuit
attempted
to
engraft
onto
the
normal
citizenship
rules
for
a
limited
partnership
the
notion
that
its
citizenship
could
be
deemed,
if
its
activities
had
a
very
close
nexus
with
the
state...
and
i'm
referring
now
to
the
passage,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
at
pages
16(a)
to
17(a)
of
the
petition
appendix.
there
are
four
page...
four
sentences
on
those
two
pages
that
capture
the
error
of
the
fourth
circuit.
and,
just
below
the
bottom,
it
says...
it
says,
"the
real
party
in
interest
owns
land
and
operates
a
substantial
part
of
its
business
in
virginia,
thus
establishing
a
very
close
nexus
with
the
commonwealth.
"
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
all
of
the
evidence,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
record
was
that
eqr
was
a
delaware
limited
partnership,
where
it
was
registered,
composed
of
a
texas
corporation
as
its
general
partner,
and
a
limited
partner
that
had
two
partners
that
were,
themselves,
texas
corporations.
so,
the
evidence
in
the
record
established
that
eqr,
which
was
the
entity
the
fourth
circuit
was
alluding
to
here,
was,
in
fact,
a
texas
citizen,
and
its
attempt
to
confuse
the
record
by
suggesting
that
there
was
a
way
to
look
at
the
citizenship
of
that
entity
through
its,
quote,
"very
close
nexus
with
the
state.
"
we
submit,
is
also
in
error.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
and
that's
where
we
think
that
the
fourth
circuit
went
off.
i'd
just
like
to
make
one
more
point
before
saving
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
and
that
is
that
if
the
fourth
circuit
was
correct,
swib
is
a
critical
party
here,
which
the
respondents
never
deny.
it
is
the
owner
of
the
apartment
building.
it
is
a
completely
proper
defendant
for
the
acts
of
negligence
in...
and
other
wrongdoings
that
they
allege.
but
they
never
mention
that
party
in
their
brief.
so,
if
the
fourth
circuit
is
correct
that
lincoln,
the
parent,
really
is
nominal
under
this
court's
decisions,
its
citizenship
should
be
completely
disregarded.
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
walden
versus
skinner
in
1879.
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
lincoln
affiliate
at
that
stage
in
the
litigation
is
a
proper
defendant,
but
non
diverse,
the
fourth
circuit
should
have
dismissed
it,
under
horn
versus
lockhart,
which
was
decided
in
1873.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
would
waive,
but
for
the
clarification
of
two
points
in
the
record.
number
one,
we
take
umbrage
at
being
accused
of
a
lack
of
candor
in
this
court.
paragraph
22
of
their
complaint
says,
and
i'll
quote,
"all
the
defendants,
acting
through
lincoln
and/or
their
obligations
as
owners
of
the
property
through
the
lease
and
acting
by
and
through
their
agents,
were
responsible
for
one
or
more
acts
of
common
law
and/or
statutory
negligent
conduct
with
respect
to
roche's
apartment,
including,
but
not
limited
to.
"
a
long
laundry
list.
when
the
parent
is
sued
for
the
acts
of
its
agents,
and
the
parent
comes
forward
and
says,
"we
will
accept
the
responsibility
for
our
agents.
"
there's
no
cause
to
be
accused
of
a
lack
of
candor
simply
because
there's
no
effort
later
to
identify
who
those
agents
are.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
lincoln
had
control.
it
was
acting
through
agents.
that's
undisputed.
but
the
lease
says
lincoln
property
company
is
the
party,
as
agent,
for
the
owner,
swib.
lincoln
property
company
set
the
policies
for
the
mold.
lincoln
property
company
hired
mr.
roche
as
an
employee.
lincoln
property
company
directed
the
actions
of
all
of
the
people
involved
in
this.
and
so,
there's
not...
there's
not
any
basis
on
which
lincoln
property
could
come...
company
could
say,
"we
are
not
responsible".
and
when
this
was--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--put
to
us--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--there
would
be
no
authority
from
this
court
to
so
hold.
and
there...
the
interrogatory
that
he
points
to,
interrogatory
number
3,
reads
as
follows,
"identify
every
person,
other
than
your
attorneys,
who
is
aware
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
mr.
roche's
lease
at
westfield
village
apartments
and
repeat
in
detail
the
substance
of
such
person's
knowledge.
"
now,
from
that
interrogatory,
we
are
supposed
to
infer
that
there
are...
a
question
about
the
citizenship
of
the
affiliated
entities
through
which
lincoln
is
operating.
we
put
forward
all
of
the
names
of
the
people
that
we
could
identify
who
had
some
knowledge
about
this.
but
i
would
submit
to
you
that
a
response,
as
he
is
suggesting
here
in
this
court,
is
not
a
reasonable
one.
finally,
with
respect
to
mr.
franzen,
the
fact
that
his
title
may
say
"partner"
surely
cannot
transform
the
corporation
documents
that
say
that
lincoln
property
company
is
a
corporation
in
the
state
of
texas.
thank
you.
