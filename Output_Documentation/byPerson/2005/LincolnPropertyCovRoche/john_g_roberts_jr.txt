chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
now
hear
argument
in
lincoln
property
v.
roche.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
i
take
it
your
answer
to
justice
souter
is
yes.
in
other
words,
if
the
mistake
that
the
court
made
was
relying
on
1441(b),
it
was
a
similar
mistake
for
you,
in
your
opening
brief,
to
put
such
weight
on
that
language
in
1441(b).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
frederick,
earlier
you
made
the
point
that
lincoln
was
a
proper
"real
party
in
interest".
i
take
it
that's
not
critical
to
your
position.
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
they
weren't
a
real
party
in
interest,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
they...
if
they
don't
have
a
proper
defendant,
they
should
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
presume,
then--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
the
plaintiff
loses,
not
that
you
get
to
have
the
court
find
the
proper
defendant
for
the
plaintiff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what...
i
know
you
contend
that's
not
the
case,
but
let's
say
there
is
a
in
state
subsidiary
that's
completely
responsible
for
all
the
challenged
actions,
and
the
in
state
plaintiff
sues
an...
only
the
out
of
state
parent.
what
happens
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
joseph.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
had
no...
i
mean,
you
had
no
real
reason
to
do
it.
you
had
somebody
there
who
accepted
responsibility,
in
the
sense
that
they
were
willing
to
defend
on
the
merits,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it's
only
because
you
lost
that
you
now
question
whether
or
not
they
should
have
accepted...
you're
saying
they
shouldn't
have
accepted
responsibility,
and
shouldn't
have
defended
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
joseph.
mr.
frederick,
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
in
no.
04-712,
lincoln
property
versus
roche.
