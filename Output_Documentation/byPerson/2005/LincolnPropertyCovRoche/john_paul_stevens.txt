mr.
frederick--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--will
you
just
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
did
the
defendant
ever
take
the
position
in
this
litigation,
in
discovery
or
anywhere
along
the
line,
that
they
sued
their
own
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct,
though,
this
entity
we're
talking
about
is
not
a
party
to
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
joseph,
can
i
ask
you
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
for
a
second?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
filed
a
reply
brief.
there
are
a
lot
of
disputes
about
the
facts.
do
you
concede
that
the
lincoln
property
company
that
you
sued
is
a
texas
corporation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
acknowledge
that
the
corporation
that
you
sued,
lincoln
property
company,
is
a
texas
corporation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understood
them
to
be
arguing,
in
essence,
that
there's
some
other
entity
that
really
is
the
real
party
in
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
dispute,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
lincoln
property
company
is
a
texas
corporation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
you
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--very
simple
"yes"
or
"no"
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
corporation
a
texas
corporation?
the
one
you
sued.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
say
yes,
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
question?
did
you
engage
in
discovery
trying
to
determine
who
the
real
party
in
interest
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
did
he...
did
he
do
a
thorough
job
of
trying
to
find
out
who
the
real
party
in
interest--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--wouldn't
it
be
his
burden,
if
he
thought
it
was
the
wrong
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
if
you
accept
the
representation,
then
they
sued
the
right
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
there
was
a
dispute
about
this,
it
ought
to...
there
ought
to
have
been
extensive
discovery
before
you
got
to
the
court
of
appeals.
