justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
(b)
simply
enacted
a
special
necessary
condition
when
you
had
a
local
defendant.
i
thought
it
was
not
an
eligibility
provision.
i
thought
it
was
a
limitation
provision.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
consistent
with
it,
but
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
say
that
anyone
who
is
properly
joined
and
served,
at
least
in
a
formal
sense,
is,
therefore,
the
only
person
who
may
be
considered
in
a...
in
a
diversity
inquiry.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
it
sounds
to
me...
if
i
understood
your
answer
correctly,
you're
talking
about
cases
in
which
the
named
party
citizenship
is
disregarded.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
the
question
is,
should
an
unnamed
party
citizenship
"be"
regarded?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
he
didn't
come
in
to
defend;
you
pulled
him
in
to
defend.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
problem
that
i
have
with
your
position
is,
i
don't
know
of
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
he
wasn't
ready
to
defend,
that
he
wouldn't
have...
or
it
wasn't
ready
to
defend,
that
it
wouldn't
have
paid
the
judgment,
that
you
could
have...
could
not
have
gotten,
from
the
party
you
named,
all
the
relief
that
you
were
asking
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
so
far
as
the
fourth
circuit...
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
here...
it
sounds
to
me
that
the
fourth
circuit
took
the
following
position,
that
for
purposes
of
determining
diversity,
it
is
not
enough
to
name
a
principal
who
may
be
liable
for
the
acts
of
subsidiaries,
without
naming
the
subsidiary,
or,
if
you
name
a...
i'm
mixing
up
principal
and
corporation--
justice
david
h.
souter
--principal
and...
corporate
parent
and
subsidiary,
or
principal
and
business
agent.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
rule
to
the
effect
that,
for
diversity
purposes,
a
plaintiff
simply
cannot
choose
to
sue
the
parent,
or
to
sue
the
principal.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
where
would
i
be
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
failure
of
the
burden
of
proof
is
apparently
a
function
of
the
fourth
circuit's
assumption
that
if
you
sue
the
parent,
you
have
a
duty
to
negate
the
possibility
of
suing
any
subsidiary;
or
if
you
sue
the
principal,
you
have
an
obligation
to
negate
the
possibility
of
suing
any
agent.
and
i
don't
see
where
that
comes,
except
out
of
the
sky
somewhere.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
everything
turned
on
the
nominal
party
finding.
justice
david
h.
souter
on
the
nominal
party
assumption.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
fourth
circuit
is
wrong
on
nominal
party,
that's
the
end
of
the
case
for
your
side.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
burden
of
proof
issue,
as
you've
just
answered
my
question,
does
not
arise
until
the
fourth
circuit
finds
that
lincoln
is
a
nominal
party.
and
if,
in
fact,
that
conclusion
is
incorrect,
then
there's
no
burden
of
proof
issue
that
has...
or
no
burden
of
proof
that
has
not
been
satisfied.
