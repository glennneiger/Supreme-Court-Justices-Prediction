justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
what
about
cases
where
a
plaintiff
sues
two
defendants...
one
is
diverse,
and
the
other
is
not
diverse...
and
there
is
a
motion
by
the
defendants
to
dismiss
for
want
of
diversity?
the
plaintiff
then
says,
"oh,
but
only
one
of
those
defendants
is
the
"real
party
whatever",
and
i
can
drop
the
other
one,
because
the
other
one
is
not
the
"real
party
in
interest"?
"
now,
that's
a
situation
where
courts,
even
if
this
court
has
never
had
that
problem,
have
said,
"if
the
second
defendant,
the
non
diverse
defendant,
is
a
"real
party",
you
can't
get
rid
of
the
case
that
way,
but
if
it's
not...
if
it's
not,
you
can
keep
the...
just
drop
it
and
keep
the
case
going
against
the
"real
party
in
interest".
"
there
are
such
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ah,
but
the
plaintiff
said,
"this
is
a
complicated
real
estate
business,
and
i
want
to
discover
whether
there
is...
whether
the
'true
defendant'
is
a
virginia
citizen,
as
i
am.
"
so,
on
the
face
of
it,
it
looks
like
there's
complete
diversity,
but,
in
fact,
the
diverse
defendant
is
hiding
the
"real
party".
i
think
that's
the
position
that
the
plaintiff
was
taking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
plaintiff--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
plaintiff
points
to
two
offices
of
the
defendant,
who's...
the
defendant
is
described
by
defendant
as
a
texas
corporation...
but
there
was
one
witness...
chaney,
was
it
+/?
who
said
that
lincoln
is
not
a
corporation.
it
is
a
partnership.
no
corporate
board.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
thought
they
got
closer
with
a
witness
named
franzen,
who
was
a
virginia
resident,
and
who
also
described
lincoln
as
a
partnership,
and
himself
as
a
partner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
plaintiff
certainly
wouldn't
want
to
say
there's
an
indispensable
party
missing,
i
take
it,
because
then
that
would
put
the
plaintiff
out
of
court.
the
plaintiff
is
arguing
that
there's
another
defendant
who
should
be
in
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
because
you
represent
the
removing
defendant,
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
the
removing
defendant
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
proper
diversity
exists?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
would
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
i
don't
know
how
we
even
get
to
the
second
question,
about
partnership.
if
you're
right
that
lincoln
is
a
corporation...
it's
a
texas
corporation,
with
its
principal
place
of
business
in
texas,
end
of
case;
it's
the
only
named
defendant...
so,
how
do
we
get
to
something
about
a
partnership?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
understand
it.
we
wouldn't
vacate
the
judgment
in
part.
if
we
reversed,--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but,
mr.
frederick,
before
that...
you
know,
read
back...
the
court...
the
fourth
circuit
has
said,
"it
appears
that
the
real
and
substantial
party
in
interest
is
this
virginia
subsidiary,
be
it
a
partnership,
be
it
a
corporation.
"
so,
it's...
the
thing
about
nexus
is
not
self
standing.
the
court
is
positing
that
there
is
a
virginia
corporation
or
a
virginia
partnership
in
the
picture,
and
then
says,
"and
given
that,
not
only
is
it...
is
it
a
virginia
entity,
but
it's
got
this
close
nexus
because
of...
it's
operating
substantially
there,
as
well.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
did
you
name
it,
in
the
complaint,
as
the
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you'll
be
left
without...
if
you've
named
the
wrong
defendant,
then
you
have
a
suit
against
no
defendant.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
automatically
dismissed.
you
didn't
substitute
another
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
about
joint
appendix
239
and
275,
both
of
which
say
that
franzen
was
not
a
partner
in
any
entity
responsible
for
managing
the
apartments
in
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
there's
no
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
named
lincoln
as
the
defendant.
and
i'm
looking
at
your
second
amended
complaint,
which
says,
"lincoln",
on
information
and
belief,
"is
a
corporation
with
its
headquarters
in
dallas,
and
it
is
the
developer
and
manager
of
the
property.
"
that's
what
you
alleged
in
your
complaint.
you
allege
that
lincoln
was
the
manager...
lincoln,
whose
texas
corporation
was
the
manager
of
the
property
in
question.
now,
would
you...
you're
saying
that
that
was
wrong,
and
you
should
have
sued
somebody
else,
and
the
court
should
cure
that
for
you?
that's...
it's
really
bizarre.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they...
let
me
stop
you
on
that
17,
and
it's
talking
about
plaintiffs,
that
suits
have
to
be
brought
in
the
name
of
the
real
party
so
that
the
defendant
isn't
in
a
situation
where
he's
sued
one
day
by
plaintiff
a,
and
is
not
home
free
when
plaintiff
b
comes
in
with
the
identical
complaint.
so,
it
was
originally
designed
with,
who
is
the
proper
party,
the
assignee
or
the
assignor?
that's
what
real
party...
that's
what
the
concept
is
familiarly
about.
who
is
the
proper
plaintiff,
not
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
rule
17
is
about
joinder
of
parties;
it's
not
about
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
that's...
it's
something
different.
it's
a...
it's
a
whole
other
animal,
because
"real
party
in
interest",
as
used
in
the
federal
rules,
is
a
device...
is
a
joinder
device,
is
in
the
joinder
rules.
now
you're
saying,
"ah,
but
there's
some
other
real
party
concept
out
there
that
has
to
do
with
jurisdiction.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
carden
was
about
in
a
partnership,
does
every
partner's
citizenship
count?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
wasn't
any
question
that...
that
it
was
the
right
or
the...
that
the
defendant
was
a
wrong
defendant
or
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
we
don't
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--who
that
party
is.
let's
go
back
to
your...
when
you
started
this
case,
you
said
that
you
would,
on
discovery...
this
is
what
you
said
in...
at
the
time
of
your
initial
complaint...
determine
if
there
is
an
additional
defendant,
or
defendant,
who
should
be
named
as
parties.
what
discovery
did
you
pursue
to
find
out
if
there
was
an
additional
defendant,
or
defendants,
who
should
be
named
as
parties?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
joseph,
do
i
take
it
that
the
essence
of
your
position
is
that
a
removing
defendant,
if
that
removing
party
is
a
corporation,
must
disclose
all
affiliates
that
may
have
been
involved
in
the...
in
the
occurrence
that
the
plaintiff
might
have,
but
failed,
to
name
as
a
defendant,
that
a
defendant...
although,
on
the
surface,
there's
complete
diversity,
a
defendant
corporation
must,
in
order
to
remove,
identify
all
subsidiaries
and
affiliates
who
might
have
been
sued,
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
defendant
never
took
the
position,
"not
me".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
defendant
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"#
yes,
we
are
the
responsible
party.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i
also--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--pointed
out
it's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
was
begun
by
tenants
who
found
mold
in
their
apartment
and
moved
out
on
that
account.
the
litigation
sparked
a
controversy
about
the
proper
court
system,
state
or
federal,
to
entertain
the
proceedings.
a
provision
of
the
u.s.
judicial
code
authorizes
the
removal
of
lawsuits
from
state
court
to
federal
court
when
the
action
begun
in
state
court
is
one
that
could
have
been
brought
originally
in
federal
court.
when
federal-court
jurisdiction
is
based
on
the
parties’
diversity
of
citizenship,
removal
is
permissible
only
if
none
of
the
parties
in
interest
properly
joined
and
served
as
defendants
is
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
which
the
action
was
brought.
christophe
and
juanita
roche,
plaintiffs
below,
respondents
here,
are
citizens
of
virginia.
filing
suit
in
state
court,
they
named
only
defendants
who
did
not
share
their
virginia
citizenship,
including
lincoln
property
company,
a
corporation
chartered
and
having
its
principal
place
of
business
in
texas.
joined
by
its
codefendants,
lincoln,
alleged
by
roche,
the
roches
to
be
the
manager
of
the
apartment
complex
in
which
they
lived,
removed
the
case
to
a
federal
district
court,
where
the
defendants
eventually
gained
summary
judgment
in
their
favor.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit
reversed
that
judgment
and
told
the
district
court
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
state
court,
although
recognizing
that
lincoln
is
a
texas
citizen
and
a
proper
party
to
the
action,
the
appellate
court
suspected
that
an
unidentified
virginia
affiliate
of
lincoln
was
the
real
and
substantial
party
in
interest.
if
there
was
such
an
affiliate,
and
if
it
had
been
made
a
defendant,
there
would
be
no
complete
diversity
of
citizenship
between
plaintiffs
and
defendants
and
therefore
no
federal-court
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
lincoln,
the
party
who
invoked
federal-court
jurisdiction
by
removing
the
case,
had
not
shown
that
no
virginia
affiliate
was
involved
in
the
superintendence
of
the
roches’
apartment
and
therefore
had
not
proved
that
diversity
jurisdiction
existed.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
defendants
may
remove
an
action
on
the
basis
of
diversity
of
citizenship
if
there
is
complete
diversity
between
all
named
plaintiffs
and
all
named
defendants
and
no
defendant
is
a
citizen
of
the
forum
state.
each
of
those
requirements
is
met
here.
when
a
plaintiff
names
only
diverse
defendants,
it
is
not
incumbent
on
those
defendants
to
negate
the
existence
of
a
potential
additional
or
substitute
defendant
whose
presence
in
the
action
would
destroy
diversity.
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
warrant
to
impose
such
a
proof
burden
on
lincoln.
congress
is
empowered
to
prescribe
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
has
sometimes
specified
that
a
named
party’s
own
citizenship
does
not
determine
its
diverse
status.
for
cases
of
the
kind
the
roches
have
instituted,
however,
congress
has
provided
simply
and
only
this
instruction:
a
corporation
shall
be
deemed
to
be
a
citizen
of
any
state
by
which
it
has
been
incorporated
and
of
the
state
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
the
jurisdictional
rule
governing
here
is
unambiguous,
and
it
is
not
amenable
to
judicial
enlargement.
because
lincoln
is
a
citizen
of
texas
and
is
not
a
citizen
of
virginia,
this
case
was
properly
removed
to
the
federal
district
court.
the
decision
reversing
the
4th
circuit
judgment
is
unanimous.
