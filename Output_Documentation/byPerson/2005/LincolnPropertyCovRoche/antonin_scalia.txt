justice
antonin
scalia
he's
a
real
party
if
you
sued
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
because
you're
going
to
lose
doesn't
mean
that
he's
not
a
real
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
anybody
you
sue
is
a
real
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
they
said
they
were,
then
it
seems
to
me...
why
don't
you
just
hold
them
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
very
odd
that
they...
they
say,
"we
were",
and
you
say,
"oh,
no,
you
weren't.
"
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
"we
shouldn't
have
sued
you".
why
don't
you
just
take
them
at
their
word
and
sue
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
they
did?
suppose
they
did
say,
"not
me",
and
you
proceeded
with
your
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay?
what
would
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
would
win
the
judgment.
would
they
be
the
real
party
in
that
controversy?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
they
would
be.
because
you
sued
them.
even
if
they're
innocent...
are
you
saying
all
innocent
parties
are
not
parties
to
the
controversy?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
any
knowledge
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
what
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh.
