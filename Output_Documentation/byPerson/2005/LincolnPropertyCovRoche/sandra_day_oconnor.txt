was
what?

well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
joseph,
i--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
thought
we
had
to
decide
whether
an
unnamed
private
party
should
be
considered
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
have
any
case
supporting
that
proposition?
justice

but
it
isn't
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
some
kind
of
roving
inquiry
of
who
would
have
been
a
better
defendant.
it
just
seems
to
me
the
fourth
circuit
rule
is
totally
unworkable
and
unprecedented.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
possibly
overcome
that,
because
the
plaintiff
is
the
master
of
its
complaint,
and
it
can
decide
who
to
sue.
and
lincoln
was
sued
as
a
corporation,
and
i
don't
see
what
business
it
is
of
a
court
to
say,
"oh,
it
should
have
been
somebody
else.
"
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
can
move,
as
a
party
to
the
case,
to
dismiss
somebody
who's
sued
for
some
reason,
but
that
isn't
what
happened
here.
