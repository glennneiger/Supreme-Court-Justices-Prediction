justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
never
heard
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought,
if
you
sue
a,
and
then
it
turns
out
a
doesn't
own
the
building,
well,
then
you've
got
to
sue
b.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
didn't
sue
b.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
too
bad,
that,
unfortunately,
if
you
don't
know
who
owns
the
building,
it's
going
to
be
hard
for
you
to
bring
the
lawsuit.
but
we
had,
i
thought,
like,
pages
and
pages
of
discovery
rules
and...
i've
never
heard,
before,
of
a
lawyer
who
has
a...
you
know,
in
this
kind
of
situation,
can't
find
out
who
owns
a
building
there.
there
are
records,
there
are
all
kinds
of
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
looked
through
the
appendix,
actually.
i
read
the
joint
appendix,
insofar
as
the
opinion
cited
it.
and
it
cited,
in
the
opinion,
several...
five
factors...
and
i
guess
there
are
no
others,
though
you
can
bring
them
out
if
there
were...
that
supported
you.
and
the
only
two
that
seemed
to
say
that
it
had
something
to
do...
that
seemed
to
have
anything
at
all
to
do
with
suggesting
that
there
was
no
diversity...
was
mr.
fred
chaney,
which
said
that
it
was
a
partnership
and
not
a
company.
i
read
that.
that
didn't
seem
to
me
to
be
what
he
said.
and
then
somebody
called
mr.
lebeau,
who
said
that
franzen
is
a
senior
vice
president
and...
a
virginia
resident...
and
partner
in
lincoln
property.
so,
i
looked
up
that,
and
it
was
on,
like,
page
273
and,
i
think,
173
there.
and
they
asked
mr.
lebeau,
and
he
says,
"lincoln
operates
through
many
different
structures,
and
i
don't
know
what
they
were
using
here.
"
am
i
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
did
i
misread
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
it
in
the
appendix?
it
said
that
he...
you
sue
person
x,
and
i
take
it
the
reason
that
you
won
this
case
in
the
fourth
circuit...
which
was
surprising
to
me...
was
that
a
person
called
mr.
franzen,
who
is
a
resident
of
virginia,
was
a
partner
of
the
defendant.
now,
i
would
like...
and,
indeed,
it
was
a
partnership
of
which
he
was
a
partner.
so,
if
a
virginia
resident
is
a
partner
of
the
defendant,
which
is
a
partnership,
then
maybe
you
were
right.
so,
i'm
interested
in
what
is
the
evidence
that
mr.
franzen
was
a
partner
of
the
defendant,
which
is
a
partnership?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
page--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that?
is
that
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
that's
better
than
what
is
in
the
opinion.
what
is
it?
181.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
to
get
the
real
parties
before
the
court,
you
have
to
sue
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
apparently,
you
didn't
sue
the
right
people
until
you
replied
to
me.
then
i
took
your
argument,
because
it
seemed
like
seven
arguments,
mixed
up,
and
i
took
that
argument
to
be
the
following.
i'm...
i,
the
plaintiff,
sued
a
defendant,
who
is
called
the
lincoln
property
company.
now,
i
grant
you,
there
is
some
evidence
that
that
defendant,
the
one
i
sued,
is
a
texas
corporation.
one,
they
showed
us
the
certificate
of
incorporation,
or
they
got
a
sworn
statement.
two,
in
my
complaint,
i
said
that's
what
he
was.
however,
there
is
some
evidence
the
other
way.
on
page
179
and
181,
we
have
a
person
named
mr.
franzen
who
says,
"i
am
a
senior
president,
vice
president,
partner
for
defendant
lincoln
property
company.
"
in
which
case,
if
that's
your
argument,
you're
telling
us...
is
that
your
argument,
that
there
is
some
evidence
the
real
defendant,
whom
i
sued,
is
not
a
corporation,
despite
the
apparent
evidence
to
the
contrary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rather,
it
is
a
partner,
and
mr.
franzen
is
a
partner
in
it.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
make
that
argument
here,
or
are
you
going
to
give
up
on
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'd
like
the...
these
are
very
expensive,
this
litigation.
you're
all
the
way
to
the
supreme
court.
it's
costing
people
a
lot
of
money.
and
if
there
is
a
legal
issue
here,
i'd
like
to
find
out
what
it
is.
i
have
exactly
the
same
question
justice
stevens
had,
which
is
where
i
started.
do
you
agree
that
the
company
you
sued,
called
lincoln
property,
is
a
texas
corporation,
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
that's
out...
fine,
that's
out
of
the
case.
the
next
question
is...
of
course
you
could
sue
a
real
company,
called
lincoln
property
or
jolly
fisherman,
and
it
could
turn
out
that
that
real
company
is
a
front,
that
it
has
no
real
existence,
its...
all
its
papers
and
everything
to
do
with
it
is
signed
by
a
totally
separate
corporation.
are
you
saying
that's
what
happened
here?
and
if
that's
what
happened
here,
which
is
the
real
corporation
and
people
in
interest?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
burden
of
proof
failure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
you,
who
is
the
real
corporation
or
person
in
interest
that
lincoln
property
is
a
kind
of
sham
or
front
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
you
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
getting
there.
i'm
not
arguing
with
you.
i'm
getting
there.
then
you
think
that
whoever
it
is
that
they
are
the
front
for
has...
is
a
virginia
resident.
is
that
what
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
might
be
a
virginia
resident.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
might
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
there
is
a
real
party
there
that
might
be
a
virginia
resident.
and
do
you
have
any
idea
whatsoever
of
what
that
real
party
is
called?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
the
evidence
that
there
is
a
virginia
resident,
in
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
guess
what
he's
saying...
i'm
trying
to
put
the...
as
good
a
light
on
it
as
i
can...
it's
a...
that
if,
in
fact...
if
a
big
real
estate
developer,
which
is
a
corporation...
what
they
do
is,
they
organize
a
lot
of
deals,
and
their
deals
would
take
the
form
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
limited
partnerships,
which
are
owned
buildings
in
various
states.
and
i
think
he's
saying,
"well,
for
diversity
purposes,
we
should
consider
the
citizenship
of
the
parent
corporation
to
be
the
citizenship
of
the
limited
partnership
that
happens
to
have
control
of
the
building
that
we're
complaining
about.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
he
thinks--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
are
responsible,
but
he
thinks
you
ought
to
have
the
citizenship
of
the
intermediate
entities
that
own,
or
manage
directly,
the
building.
