justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
taking
that
point
just
a
bit
further,
your
reply
brief...
the
reply
brief
for...
for
shell
says
that
the
respondent
has
conceded
that
the
pricing
decision
to
sell
at
the
same
price
was
not
made
till
8
months
afterwards.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
quite
a
fair
statement.
that
isn't
inconsistent
with
its
suggestion
that
there
might
have
been
an
agreement
even
before
the
joint
venture
to
have
single
pricing.
they
just
waited
until
8
months
to
do
it.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
your
yellow
brief
correctly
characterized
their
position.
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
the
parties
indifferent
as
to
how
much
of
each
brand
was
sold?
texaco
didn't
care
if
shell
got
90
percent
of
the
sales?
it
just
didn't
care?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
if
they
cared,
doesn't
that
show
that
there
was
still
an
element
of
competition,
but
the
competition
is
suppressed
if
the
price
is
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
more
question
and
then...
how
was
it
decided
how
much
raw
gas
would
be
delivered
to
the
venture
by
the
two
parties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
minear,
you
indicated
that
in
the
first
8
months,
when
there
was
differential
pricing,
you
said
that
was
the
way
to
allocate
profits.
i
thought
they
shared
the
profits
on
some
other
basis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
don't...
i
don't
understand,
mr.
alioto,
if
the
profits
are...
are
not
traceable
to
how
much
of...
of
the
two
products
are
sold,
if
the
profits
aren't
divided
that
way,
why
should
the
two
lines
be
continued
to
be
marketed
independently?
there's
no
other
analog
i
can
think
of
in...
in
the
business
world
for
that.
there...
there's
no
motive
to
make
one
any
cheaper
than
the
other
once
the
profits
are
shared
evenly,
and
that's
the
structure
of
the
venture.
