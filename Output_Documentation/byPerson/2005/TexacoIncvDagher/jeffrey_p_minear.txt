mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
this
case
in...
in
its
ruling
that
a
alleged
agreement
between
two
noncompeting
owners
of
a
joint
venture
respecting
price
is
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
and
this
is
not
a
per
se
violation
for
two
particular
reasons.
first,
the
venture
in
this
case
is
not
a
sham,
but
rather
a
lawful
efficiency
enhancing
integration
of
economic
activity.
and
second,
the
parties
in
this
case
do
not
compete
with
one
another
or
the
joint
venture
in
the
selling
of
the
product.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
as
this
case
comes
to
this
court,
that's
a
necessary
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
determination.
in
the
district
court,
the
parties...
the
respondents
had
argued
that
this
was
a
patently
anticompetitive
joint
venture,
and
the
district
court
rejected
that,
and
it
said
at
page
68
of
the
texaco
petition
appendix
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
find
that
this
joint
venture
is
patently
anticompetitive.
and
it
further
found
that
respondents
did
not
make
a
rule
of
reason
challenge
to
the
legitimacy
of
the
joint
venture.
so
as
the
case
came
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
came
to
it
with
that
ruling,
and
the
court
of
appeals
itself
at
pages
4a
and
5a
of
the
petition
appendix--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
it
wasn't,
but
we
don't
think
that
citizens
publishing
has
a
direct
bearing
on
the
case
here.
this
court's
reasoning
with
regard
to
per
se
analysis
and
joint
ventures
have
evolved
beyond
the
simple
statement
that
was
made
in
citizens
publishing.
instead,
the
court
looks
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
agreement
at
issue
is
plainly
anticompetitive.
and
as
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
such
as
bmi
and
ncaa
have
recognized,
the...
simply
attaching
the
moniker
of
price
fixing
or
pricing
implication
is
not
sufficient
to
answer
the
question,
the
fundamental
question
here,
which
is
is
there
actually
a
fixing
of
prices
between
two
parties
that
are
in
competition.
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
pricing
implication
agreement
that's
alleged
in
this
case
is...
arises
out
of
a
joint
venture
in
which,
by
the
very
nature
of
the
joint
venture
itself,
the
two
participants
no
longer
compete,
and
in
the
absence
of
such
competition,
this
is
much
like
a
merger.
and
in
the
same
way
that
if
the
two
parties
had
merged
their
downstream
operations,
they
would
be
able
to
choose
whatever
prices
that
they
chose.
likewise,
the
same
applies
with
regard
to
the
joint
venture,
and
it's
particularly
true
that
this
cannot
be
subject
to
a
per
se
analysis.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
and
with
regard
to--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct.
and
so
an
agreement
outside
the
joint
venture
to
take...
to
enter
into
anticompetitive
activity
outside
the
joint
venture
is
subject
to
further
analysis.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
decision,
once
the
joint
venture
took
effect,
as
to
how
the
products
would
be
priced,
was
simply
an
allocation
of
the
profits
of
the
joint
venture.
there's
no
actual
competition
between
texaco
and
shell.
that
was
simply
the
formula
for
determining--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor.
but
in...
in
that
regard,
there's
competition
at
the
pump,
but
there's
no
competition...
as
between
those
two
gas
stations,
but
there's
no
competition
between
the
owners
of
the
joint
venture
here,
texaco
and
shell.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
all
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that's
the
factual
dispute
that
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
texaco
and
shell
take
the
position
that
simply
this
is
a
decision
that's
made
by
the
owners
of
equilon
or
equilon
itself--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
there
isn't.
and
in
fact,
that
is
why
this
cannot
be
analyzed
under
the
per
se
rule.
this
is
simply
a
situation
in
which
a
single
company
is
selecting
the
prices
of
its...
of
its--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--respondents'
view
is
that
there
was
an
agreement
that
was
entered
into,
an
alleged
agreement,
at
the
time
of
formation
of
this
entity,
in
which
texaco
and
shell
agreed
to
set
the
texaco
product
and
the
shell
product
at
the
same
price.
and
the
united
states'
response
to
that
is
that
cannot
be
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
that
is
simply...
there...
because
the
parties
are
not
competing
with
one
another,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
or
not
they've
agreed
to
set
it
as
the
same
price
or
different
prices.
it
simply
is
irrelevant
to
the
anticompetitive--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
is
more
the
latter,
your
honor,
that
what
happens
in
these
cases
the
refineries
refine
unbranded
gasoline.
they
send
it
to
distribution
centers,
the
terminals,
and
at
that
point
additives
are
added
and
the
gasoline
then
is
sold
as
either
texaco
or
shell
gasoline.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
that
is
simply
the
choice
that
the
owners--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is...
would
be
the
same
as
if
the
owners
or
the
shareholders
made
a
decision
about
how
two
different
products--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
your
honor,
in
that
situation
there
could
be
an
antitrust
violation,
but
it
would
not
be
a
per
se
violation.
it
would
be
a
rule
of
reason
violation.
and
as
this
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
question
is
whether
is
there...
there
was
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
we
cannot
say
that
this
agreement,
if
it
exists,
was
so
plainly
anticompetitive
that
it
can
be
condemned
without
a
further
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
relationship
here.
i'd
like
to
point
out
also
the
court
of
appeals
erred
further
by
trying
to
limit
the
effects
of
its
per
se
ruling
by
invoking
the
ancillary
restraints
doctrine.
the
ancillary
restraints
doctrine
does
not
apply
here.
it
applies
to
a
situation
that
justice
souter
referred
to
earlier
where
if
the
two
parties
entered
into
a
joint
venture
and
then
the
owners
of
the
joint
venture
agreed
to
some
agreement
outside
of
the
joint
venture...
for
instance,
to...
to
set
the
price
of
their
products
outside
the
joint
venture...
in
that
situation,
under
the
ancillary
restraints
doctrine,
the
question
would
be
is
that
particular
agreement
reasonably
necessary
for...
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
joint
venture.
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
the
agreement
here
goes
to
the
conduct
of
the
venture
itself,
and
even
under
a
rule
of
reason
analysis,
the
inquiry
would
be,
first,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
agreement.
does
it
have
anticompetitive
effects?
and
are
those
anticompetitive
effects
outweighed
by
other
procompetitive
benefits?
that
is
the
type
of
analysis
that
would
be
made
in
this
case
if
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
was
invoked
by
respondents.
they
have
not
done
that
in
this
case,
and
the
same
rule...
the
same
reasoning
applies
with
respect
to
the
quick
look
doctrine.
in
both
of
those
cases,
there
simply
is
not
a
basis
for
finding
a
antitrust
violation,
and
this
court
should
reverse
the
finding
of
the...
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
reinstate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
granting
summary
judgment
to
petitioners.
this
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--if
i
said
that,
i
misspoke.
the
profits
were
shared
based
on
a
ratio
of
the
contributions
of...
of
assets
that
were
devoted
to
the
joint
venture.
what
i
meant
to
say,
rather,
was
it
could
have
been
more
like
a
performance
based
pricing
mechanism,
but
it
does...
it
had
no
bearing
on
the...
the
relative
profits
that
either
firm
would
make.
it
was
simply
a
pricing
decision.
equilon
had
to
price
its
products
at
some
price,
and
so
initially
it
set
it
at
some...
whatever
prices
they
may
have
been.
but
ultimately
the
pricing
decision
is...
simply
does
not
have
anticompetitive
significance
here.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
case...
thank
you,
your
honor.
