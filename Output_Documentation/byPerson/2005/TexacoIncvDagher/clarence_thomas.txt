justice
clarence
thomas
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit.
petitioners
texaco
and
shell
oil
collaborated
in
a
joint
venture
called
equilon
enterprises,
inc.
to
refine
and
sell
gasoline
to
the
western
united
states
and
to
do
so
under
the
original
texaco
and
shell
oil
brand
names.
respondents,
a
class
of
texaco
and
shell
oil
service-station
owners,
alleged
that
petitioners
engaged
in
unlawful
price-fixing
when
equilon
set
a
single
price
for
both
texaco
and
shell
oil-brand
gasoline.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
pricing
practice
was
per
se
illegal
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
not
per
se
illegal
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
for
a
lawful,
economically
integrated
joint
venture
to
set
the
prices
at
which
it
sells
its
products.
under
our
precedents,
per
se
liability
is
reserved
for
those
agreements
that
are
so
plainly
anticompetitive
that
no
elaborate
study
of
the
industry
is
needed
to
establish
their
illegality.
price-fixing
agreements
between
two
or
more
competitors,
known
as
horizontal
price-fixing
agreements,
fall
into
the
category
of
arrangements
that
are
per
se
unlawful.
we
are
not
presented
with
such
an
agreement
here,
however,
because
texaco
and
shell
oil
did
not
compete
with
one
another
in
the
relevant
market.
instead,
they
participated
in
that
market
jointly
through
their
investment
in
equilon.
throughout
equilon’s
existence,
texaco
and
shell
oil
shared
in
the
profits
of
equilon’s
activities
in
their
role
as
investors,
not
competitors.
the
court
of
appeals
erred
when
it
imposed
per
se
liability
by
invoking
the
ancillary
restraints
doctrine.
that
doctrine
governs
the
validity
of
restrictions
imposed
by
illegitimate
joint
venture
or
non-venture
activities.
here,
by
contrast,
the
challenged
business
practice
involves
the
core
activity
of
the
joint
venture
itself;
that
is,
the
pricing
of
the
goods
produced
and
sold
by
equilon.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
