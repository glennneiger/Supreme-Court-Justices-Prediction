mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
a
decision
to
unify
the
prices
charged
for
the
two
branded
gasoline
products
sold
by
a
joint
venture
created
by
shell
and
texaco
could
be
deemed
a
per
se
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
plainly
wrong.
a
joint
venture
has
to
be
able
to
and
is
entitled
to
create
and
set
the
prices
for
the
products
that
it
sells.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
believe
the...
the
short
answer
to
your
question
is...
is
yes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
first
question.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
it
is
undeniable...
and
mr.
minear
can
speak
on
behalf
of
the
ftc
to
this.
i
think
it
is
undisputed
that
the
government
understood
that
this
joint
venture
was
a
consolidation
of
both
the
refining
assets
of
the
two
companies,
as
well
as
the
marketing
functions
of
the
two
companies,
and
that
it
would
own
the
gasoline
and
it
would
decide
how
to
sell
it
and
what
price
to
sell
it
at.
i
don't--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
don't
know
off
the
top
of
my
head,
justice
souter,
whether
there's
a
specific
document
that
says
marketing
includes
pricing.
but
i
don't
think
that
anyone
had
any
doubt
that
this
included
pricing.
and
indeed,
the
respondents,
of
course,
in
bringing
their
challenge,
haven't
framed
this
as
a
challenge
to
the
ability
and
right
of
the
joint
venture
to
set
its
prices.
what
they've
challenged
is
the
subsequent
decision
that
was
made
to
sell
the
texaco
branded
equilon
gasoline
and
the
shell
branded
equilon
gasoline
at
the
same
price.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i...
i
think
that
that's
a...
a
fair
interpretation
of
one
possible
understanding
of
their
brief,
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
think
that
it
matters
for
this
court
in
deciding
this
case
whether
there
was
discussions
by
the
owners
of
the
joint
venture
earlier
than
the
time
of
september
of
1998
whether
they
were
going
to
unify
the
prices
or
not.
the...
the
important
point
for
this
court
is
that
this
was
an
efficiency
enhancing
joint
venture.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
question
that.
and
that
in
an
efficiency
enhancing
joint
venture,
it
is
entitled
to
set
the
prices
of
its
product,
whether
it
decides
to
do
it
8
months
after
the
venture
is
in
operation
or
2
months
before,
as
long
as
what
they're
doing
is
setting
the
prices
of
the
products
of
the
venture
itself.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
what
i
can
say
to
that,
justice
breyer,
is
our
opponents
have
repeatedly
pointed
out
in
their
briefs
deposition
testimony
that
the
parties
refused
to
discuss
price
with
each
other
before
they
had
an
actual
memorandum
of
understanding
out
of
concerns
about
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i'll
have
to
leave
that
for
the
respondents
to
address
for
you.
but
what...
what
the
court
below
pointed
to
was
conversations
that
took
place
in
the
spring
of
1998
about
a
strategic
marketing
initiative.
and
this
is
after
the
formation
of
equilon,
after
equilon
was
operational.
and
at
that
point,
all
you
conceivably
have
at
that
point
with
the
owners
of
equilon
having
left
the
market
is
equilon
subject
to
the
direction
of
its
owners
setting
the
prices
for
its
products,
and
it
could
sell
them
as
shell
gasoline,
it
could
sell
them
as
texaco
gasoline,
it
could
choose
to
sell
them
as
something
else.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i'm
not
sure
what
the
reference
is,
justice
ginsburg.
once
the
joint
venture
existed,
equilon
had
its
own
marketing
strategy,
and
motiva,
the
other
joint
venturer,
had
its
own
marketing
strategy.
the...
the
role
of
the
owners
at
that
point
was
on
a
members
committee,
which...
as
a
typical
board
of
directors
where
the...
each
ceo
of
each
joint
venture
had
to
present
a
business
plan
and
obtain
approval
by
the
owners
of
the...
of
the
joint
ventures
for
the
upcoming
year.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
don't
think
we
could
say
they
didn't
care
because
there
were,
as
part
of
the
joint
venture
agreement,
brand
management
protocols
to
preserve
the
equality
of
the
brands.
but
that
was
the
only
limitation,
and
that's
a
limitation
that
could
be
challenged.
don't
misunderstand
our
position
in
this
case.
that
was
part
of
the
agreement
to
create
the
joint
venture.
that
is
subject
to
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
but
it's
challengeable
on
a
rule
of
reason
inquiry
because
this
is
an
efficiency
enhancing
joint
venture.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
not
in...
not
for...
with
regard
to
equilon
because
why
they
care,
justice
kennedy,
is
that...
that
they
licensed
these
brand
names
to
the
joint
ventures
and
they
maintained
control
of
the
asset
that
they
licensed,
their
name,
because
they
operated
in
other
markets
where
they
weren't
in
competition
with
equilon
and
motiva.
they
did
do
business
in
other
countries
around
the
world,
selling
branded
gasoline,
unbranded
gasoline,
and
other
petroleum
products.
but
as
with
any
licensor,
they
care
that
the...
that
the
good
will
that
they're
licensing
is
not
impaired.
so
like
any
licensor,
they
put
restrictions
on
the
ability
of...
of
the
joint
ventures
to
disparage
those
names
or
to
undermine
those
names.
but
the
decisions
as
to
how
to
market
and
what
to
sell
and
at
what
price
to
sell
was
the
single
entity
equilon
in
the
western
united
states,
and
that's
why
it's
not
covered
by
section
1,
much
less
subject
to
per
se
analysis.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
was
a
decision
made
by
equilon.
equilon
would
purchase
petroleum
on
the
open
market.
it
could
purchase
it
from
shell.
it
could
purchase
it
from
texaco.
it
could
purchase
it
from
british
petroleum.
and
it...
the...
the
petroleum
products
are
bought
on
the
open
market
in
arm's
length
transactions,
sent
to
the
refineries,
and
then
the
managers
of
equilon
or
motiva
would
make
the
decision
as
to
which
petroleum
products
to
make
out
of
that
crude.
what's
important
to
remember
here
is
that
sherman
act
doesn't
apply
to
any
agreement.
under
this
court's
decision
in
copperweld,
it
applies
to
decisions
between
independent
actors,
that
section
1
applies
to
concerted
activity,
not
to
unilateral
activity,
so
that
in
copperweld,
a
parent
could
not
enter
into
a
conspiracy
with
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary.
in
copperweld,
the
court...
the
court
points
out
that
the
officers
of
a
company
may
enter
into
agreements
with
each
other,
but
they
don't
enter
into
agreements
covered
by
section
1.
they're
agreements
within
a
single
entity.
and
what
we
have
here
is
the
same
thing
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
copperweld
in
getting
to
its
decision
in
copperweld,
is
you
have
a
agreement
of
shell
and
texaco,
which
is
plainly
subject
to
section
1,
to
create
this
joint
venture
and
can
be
challenged
on
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
but
once
they
have
that
agreement,
you
now
have
the
directors
of
a
single
entity
determining
what
the
prices
of
its
products
will
be,
and
that
is
not
subject
to
further
section
1--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes,
justice
scalia,
but
i
don't
think
that
anyone
would
ever
do
that
in
a
rule
of
reason
section
1
analysis.
what
they'd
look
at
in
a
rule
of
reason
section
1
analysis
is
whether
the
combined
entity
would
have
the
sufficient
market
power
to
engage
in
supracompetitive
pricing.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
section
1
cases
it
doesn't
ask
whether
the
specific
price
set
is
a
reasonable
price--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
what
i...
what
i
tried
to
say,
justice
breyer...
maybe
i
should
change
my
answer
to
no.
what
i
tried
to
say
is...
is
that
the
facts
at
the...
at...
that
are
involved
in
the
creation
of
the
joint
venture...
all
of
them
can
be
considered
as
part
of
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
but
what
i
tried
to
go
on
to
say
to
justice
scalia
was
no
one
doing
that
rule
of
reason
analysis
would
care
about
what
the
specific
price
is.
that
isn't
what
they
would
look
at.
what--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that's
correct.
and
in
this--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--in
this
particular
case,
the
respondents
made
a
conscious
litigation
choice
in
the
district
court
to
waive
a
rule
of
reason
claim.
and
this
case
proceeded
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
rule
of
reason
challenge
to
the
creation
of
the
joint
venture
as
waived.
the
court
below
didn't
question
that
at
all.
it
accepted
it.
it
accepted
that
there
had
been
a
waiver
of
a
rule
of
reason
challenge,
that
this
efficiency
enhancing
joint
venture
had
substantial
economic
justifications,
and
what
it...
and
the
only...
the
only
rule
of
reason
challenge
that
could
have
been
brought
then
was
waived
by
these
parties.
another
case.
that's
not
this
case.
another
case,
a
rule
of
reason
inquiry
could
be
brought.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
depends
upon
facts
that
you
haven't
stated.
if
the
original
joint
venture
is
a
sham
for
a
horizontal
arrangement--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
i'm
not
sure
at
that
point
that
they've
entered
into
an
agreement
to
share
the
risks
and
loss...
of
profit
and
loss
from
the
assets
that
they're
putting
together.
i
mean,
this
court's
decision
in
maricopa
county
says
that
that's
the
critical
test.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i...
i
can't
say
that
because
you
get
to
ask
the
questions.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it's
a
big
country,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
happen
out
there
and
so
i
can't
assume
that
i
want
you
going
back
to
chambers
thinking
that
it
can't
happen.
i
want
to
answer
it
even
if
it
can
happen--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
don't
think
so.
it's
like
a
law
firm.
it's
like
my
law
firm.
when
i
join
together
with
my
partners,
we
may
agree
in
our
partnership
agreement
that
each
partner
is
going
to
have
some
control
over
what
their
billing
rate
is.
as
long
as
we
have
thrown
our
lot
in
together
and
as
long
as
we're
sharing
the
risks
and
loss
of
that
activity...
that
may
be
a
stupid
thing--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
again,
i
don't
think...
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
very
many
business
persons
getting
together
and
entering
into
such
an
arrangement.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
but
as
long
as--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i...
i
think
the
answer
is...
is
that
if
the...
if
the...
the
joint
venture
itself
was
an
efficiency
creating
joint
venture
that
can
survive
rule
of
reason
scrutiny,
that
business
has
the
right
to
conduct
itself
subject
to
the
restrictions
that
were
put
in
the
original
agreement.
that
agreement
to
reserve
the
power
to
the
parents
would
be
subject
to
challenge
as
part
of
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
whether
they
entered
into
an
agreement
later
or
not,
but
the
challenge
goes
to
the
terms
upon
which
the
venture
is
created,
not
to
the
operational
activities
of
the
venture.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
three
quick
points.
one,
just
to
bring
us
back
to
the
stipulated
facts
of
this
case,
i'd
ask
the
court
to
check
the
joint
appendix,
page
78
to
79,
stipulated
fact
number
62.
the
second
sentence
of
that
stipulation
says,
after
the
formation
of
equilon
and
motiva,
the
pricing
was
consolidated
so
that
one
person
at
equilon
set
prices
for
both
the
shell
and
texaco
brands
in
any
given
equilon
pricing
area,
and
one
person
at
motiva
set
prices
for
both
brands
in
any
given
motiva
pricing
area.
there's
never
been
any
allegation
in
this
case
that
shell
and
texaco
set
the
actual
prices
at
which
this
gasoline
was
sold
at.
the
only
claim
then
that
the
owners
of
the
joint
venture
said
that
the
prices
had
to
be
the
same
between
the
two
branded
names
in
any
given
area.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
8
month
period
that
the
respondents
keep
pointing
to,
the
record
reflects
testimony
that,
as
with
any
consolidation
of
two
businesses
that
have
been
separate
and
are
coming
together,
it
took
them
a
few
months
to
figure
out
how
to
consolidate
and
unify
and
save
the
$800
million
a
year
that
was
the
purpose
of
this
joint
venture
in
consolidating.
no...
no
two
companies,
when
they
create
a
joint
venture
or
merge,
instantaneously
are
able
to
operate
as
if
they
didn't
previously
exist.
it
takes
a
while.
and
the
third
point...
and
this
is
the
point
that
justice
breyer
has
made.
when
this
joint
venture
was
created,
it
eliminated
competition
in
the
united
states
for
branded
gasoline
between
shell
and
texaco.
that's
a
stipulated
fact
in
this
case.
and
when
it
eliminated
competition
between
shell
and
texaco,
there
was
no
further
competition
to
effect.
there
was
no
further
anticompetitive
consequence
that
could
happen
from
the
pricing
of
the
gasoline
of
that
joint
venture.
it's
your
three
counters
in
the
department
store.
and
if
there
is
no
further
anticompetitive
effect
that
can
happen,
there's
no
quick
look
reason
possible,
justice
souter,
for
the
issue
that's
been
challenged
in
this
case.
your
hypothetical
goes
to
the
formation
which
they
waived.
thank
you
very
much.
