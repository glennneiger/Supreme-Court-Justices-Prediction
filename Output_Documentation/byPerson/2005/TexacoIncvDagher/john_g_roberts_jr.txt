chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
in
texaco
inc.
v.
dagher
and
shell
oil
v.
dagher.
mr.
nager.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
respondents
don't
concede
that
the
joint
venture
is
lawful,
though.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
the
citizens
publishing
case,
it
wasn't
a
necessary
predicate
of
the
court's
ruling
there
to
find
that
the
joint
venture
was
unlawful,
was
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
two
parties
obviously
don't
compete
within
the
terms
of
the
joint
venture,
but
they
compete
more
generally.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
couldn't
have
two
companies
say
we're
not
going
to...
we're
going
to
have
a
joint
venture
on
this
corner,
but
in...
you
know,
down
the
block,
we're
going
to
compete,
and
then
it's
all
right
to
set
prices
on
this
corner
but
not
down
the
block.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
alioto.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
they
had
combined
and
if
they
had
agreed
in
the
joint
venture
to
sell
a
new
brand
of
gasoline,
equilon
gasoline,
of
course,
they
would...
the
joint
venture
would
be
free
to
set
the
price
of
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
it's
correct...
if...
if
that's
correct,
what
is
the
difference
if
the
joint
venture
decides
that
it's
going...
they're
going
to
make
more
money
having
two
separate
brands
and
even
though
it's
equilon
gas,
the
people
are
going
to
think
it's
different
because
some
people
have
always
bought
from
texaco
and
others
from
shell?
it's
not
going
to
affect
how
the
profits
are
distributed.
it's
still
going
to
be
the
same
whether
it's
equilon
gas
or
texaco
and
shell.
why
does
the
joint
venture
lose
the
authority
to
set
the
price
of
its
product?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
concede
that
it
would
have
been
perfectly
legal
for
them
to
do
that
if
they
called
all
of
their
gasoline
equilon
gasoline
because
they
owned
all
the
gas
and
the
profits
are
going
to
be
distributed
to
the
owner
the
same
way
whether
they
call
them
texaco
or
shell.
why
is
it
suddenly
different
because
they
put
different
labels
on
the...
keep
different
labels
on
the
gasoline?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
now
you're
backing
away
from
your
concession.
if
you
have
a
lawful
joint
venture
that's
marketing
a
product,
the
joint
venture
has
to
be
able
to
set
the
price
of
the
product.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
no,
if
it's...
if
it's
a
lawful
joint
venture
and
it's
selling
gasoline...
there's
no
retaining
of
prior
brands...
the
joint
venture
sets
the
price.
and
if
the...
and
all
those
people
you
said
suffered
when
equilon
did
this,
those
same
number
of
people
would
have
suffered
if
they're
selling
equilon
gasoline
at
a
price
determined
by
the
joint
venture.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
artificial
hook
that
you're
trying
to
hang
your
case
on,
which
is
they
retained
for
presumably
legitimate
brand
competition
reasons
their
separate
brands,
but
that
was
the
decision
of
the
joint
venture.
and
again,
the
joint
venture
has
to
be
able
to
price
its
product
whether
it's
sold
as
equilon
or
whether
it's
sold
as
texaco
or
shell
under...
under
the
same...
same
joint
venture.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

thank
you,

alioto.
chief

mr.
nager,
you

2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
in
04-805,
texaco
versus
dagher,
and
no.

oil
