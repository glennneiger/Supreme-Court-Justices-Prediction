but,
mr.

justice
john
paul

--mr.
alioto--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
it
not
correct
that
in
the
citizens
publishing
case
the
agreement
itself
was
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
did
they
get
into
the
discussion
of
the
failing
company
doctrine
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
the
government
and
everybody
agrees
that
the
joint
venture
is
perfectly
lawful,
i'm
still
not
quite
sure
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
if
they
can
fix
the
price
of
a
single
brand,
why
can't
they
fix
the
price
of...
of
two
brands
at
the
same
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
that's
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
one
of
the
ironic
things
about
this
aspect
of
the
law.
if
they
just
made
the
agreement
by
themselves
without
forming
the
joint
venture,
it
would
be
illegal
per
se,
but
if
they
restrain
competition
even
more
by
forming
a
joint
venture,
then
it's
perfectly
okay.
but
that's
apparently
what
the
law
provides.
