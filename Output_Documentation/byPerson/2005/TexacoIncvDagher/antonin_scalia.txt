justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
acknowledge
that
the
rule
of
reason
analysis
of
the...
of
the
initial
formation
can
include
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
of
whether
it...
it
would
violate
the...
the
sherman
act
to...
to
have
the
new
entity
price
both
products
the
same?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
you...
you
just
never
get
beyond
step
one.
you
don't
go
any
further
if
there's
no
market
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
don't
really...
who...
who
would
set
the
price
if
it
was
not...
if
it
was
not
the
joint
venture?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
joint
venture
owns
the
gasoline.
okay?
and
it
owns
the
gas
stations,
those
that
aren't
independent
stations.
and
somebody
else
is
going
to
set
the
price
for
the
gas
that
the
joint
venture
owns?
wouldn't
you
need
some
separate
agreement
that
clearly
sets
that
forth?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
board
of
directors.
isn't
it?
isn't
the
members
committee
the
board
of
directors
of...
of
the
joint
venture?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
because
it's
a
joint
venture.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
nature
of
a
joint
venture.
the
board
of
directors
is
composed
of
people
representing
the
various
elements
of
the
joint
venture.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
nothing
subversive
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that's
because
the
joint
venture
did
not
include...
did
not
include
a
merging
of
the
product
as
it
did
here.
here,
the
gasoline
from
both
of
them
was
merged
into
one
gasoline,
which
was
sold
and
the
profit
of
which
was
divided
between
them.
in...
in
citizens
publishing,
each
of
the
newspapers
continued
to
sell
its
own
newspaper
and
to...
and
to
reap
whatever
profit
it
could
make
from
its
own
newspaper.
that's
fundamentally
different
from
here.
there...
there
still
is
competition
between
the
two
newspapers.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
were
competitors.
they
were...
each
one
of
them
sold
its
own
newspaper.
all
they
merged
was...
was
their
publishing
facilities.
and
when
they
agreed
separately
not
to...
to
charge
the
same
price
for
the
newspaper,
that
was
not
part
of
the
joint
venture.
that
was,
indeed,
an
agreement
between
competitors.
there
were
two
separate
newspapers
selling
on
the
basis
of
their
own
distribution
system
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they're
not
able
to
fix
the
price
unless
they
have
market
dominance.
i
mean,
do
you
think
they're
just
competing
with
each
other?
aren't
there
other
companies
selling
gasoline?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
think
that
this...
this
joint
venture
would
have
been
allowed
if...
if
these
two
companies
together
dominated
the
market.
of
course,
it
wouldn't
have
been
allowed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
fix
prices
successfully.
justice
antonin
scalia
fix...
fix
prices
and
not
be
an
idiot
at
the
same
time.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't...
you
don't
want
them
to
present
it
to
a
jury,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
them
to
present
it
to
a
jury.
the
whole
reason
that
you're
here
is
that
you
want
us
to
declare
a
per
se
violation.
you...
you
want
to
put
it
to
a
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
alioto--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who...
who
is
it
that
you
would
have
had
the
price
set
by?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
their
gas.
okay?
they're
marketing
it
through
their
stations.
who...
who
would
have
set
the
price
if...
if
we
said
it's...
it's
bad
for
equilon
to
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
gave
whom
independence?
gave
whom--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
did
give
them
independence.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
gave
their
board
of
directors
independence.
now,
the
board
of
directors
was
composed,
as...
as
boards
of
directors
of
joint
ventures
are,
by
the
parties
to
the
joint
ventures.
justice
antonin
scalia
who...
have
you
answered
my
question?
who
would
you
have
wanted
to
set
the
price
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
think
they
did
say
the
former.
you...
you
make
the
price
decisions.
equilon.
justice
antonin
scalia
your...
your
complaint
is
that
equilon
is
in
reality
a
joint
venture
of...
of
the
two...
the
two
gasoline
companies.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
complaint.
