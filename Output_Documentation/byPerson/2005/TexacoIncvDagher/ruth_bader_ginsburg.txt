then
what
did
it
mean...
i
think
you
said
it
in
your
brief
that
both
brands
were
sold
exclusively
by
equilon
after
the
joint
venture
created...
was
created.
each
venturer
maintains
its
own
marketing
strategy.
what
was
the
marketing
strategy
that
each
venturer,
shell
and
texaco,
separately
maintained?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
citizens...
citizens
publishing
did
not
have
a
joint
venture
that
had
advance
approval
from
the
ftc.
it
had--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i
think
that
makes
a
big
difference.
i
mean,
the
ftc
blessed
this
and
said
it
was
okay.
they
asked
for
certain
adjustments.
those
were
made.
one
of
them
was
not,
that
you
had
to
maintain
a
differential
in
the
price
between
texaco
and
shell.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
ftc,
which
is
the
expert
agency,
said
we
don't
think
this
joint
venture
is
an
antitrust
violation.
don't
we
owe
some
respect
to
that
determination,
which
was
absent
in
citizens
publishing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
a
very
naive
question?
is...
this
is
basically
the
same
commodity,
gasoline.
they
have
different
attitude...
additives,
but
basically
costs
the
same.
facilities
to
produce
it
are
the
same.
why
should
they...
should
there
be
from...
now
that
they're
marketing
this
under
one
joint
venture,
why
should
they
make
a
difference
in
the
price
of
what
is
basically
the
same
commodity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
difference
physically
is
there
other
than
they
have
different
additive...
additives?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
briefs
said
that
the
reason
for
that
price
hike
was
that
there
was
an
explosion
in
a
refinery
in
california
and
outages
in
others
and
that
there
was
a
market
wide
price
increase.
that
was
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
is
the
answer...
in...
in
case
the
court
does
not
agree
with
you,
can
you
then
say,
i
would
like
to
resurrect
rule
of
reason
or
do
you
agree
with
your
adversary
that...
that
that's
out
of
the
case
because
you
forfeited
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ordinary,
routine
rule
of
reason
you
have
waived.
is
that
so?
