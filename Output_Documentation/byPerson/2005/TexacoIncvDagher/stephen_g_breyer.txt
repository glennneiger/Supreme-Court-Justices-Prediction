justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
would
depend.
that's
why...
really
it's
a
question
for
mr.
alioto,
but
i
want
to
know
chapter
and
verse
citations.
pan
am
and
grace
meet
before
they
set
up
panagra.
of
course,
they
talk
about
price.
but
what
do
they
say?
suppose
what
they
say
is
you,
panagra,
have
the
power
to
set
price.
normal.
you,
panagra,
have
the
power
to
set
price
but
never
below
$14
a
ticket.
that
wouldn't
be
normal.
what
are
they
trying
to
do
there?
they're
trying
to
protect
grace.
so
i
think
a
lot
would
depend
on
what
they
said
in
the
preliminary
meeting,
and
of
course,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
is
a
summary
judgment
motion
where,
as
the
other
side
pointed
to
particular
conversations
that
they
made
which
would
say
it's
more
like
the
second
than
the
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
may
be,
but
still
at
some
point
they
discussed
it
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
they
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
a
surprising
concession
to
me.
we...
we
found
a...
a
joint
marketing
company.
all
right?
and
the
whole
point
of
this
is
to
set
single
prices.
and
you're
saying
when
they...
and
the
venture,
let's
say,
is
approved
by
the
ftc,
the
joint
selling
agency.
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
set
a
single
price
to
sell
in
france
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
saying
now
we're
going
to
go
look
at
their
prices
that
they
set
and
decide
if
they're
reasonable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
there
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
right.
i
would
have
thought
there's
no
competition
because
there
are
not
two
independent
decision
makers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
prices
that
end
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
you
could
explain
to
me
how
this
did
work.
the...
the...
my
understanding,
which
might
be
not
correct,
is
we
have
some
facilities
that
refine
gasoline
and
there
are
some
people
who
take
the
gasoline
that
is
refined
and
they
sell
it
to
gas
stations.
now,
those
facilities
and
those
people
now
work
for
one
hierarchy
of
officials
called
equilon.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
somebody
has
to
say
what
price
it's
being
sold
at.
equilon's
gas.
who
decides
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
imagine
there
are
some
human
beings
in
equilon
called
marketers,
and
those
human
beings
in
equilon
who
work
for
equilon
would
say
equilon
will
sell
the
refined
gasoline
to
gas
stations
at
such
and
such
prices.
that's
normally
how
a
company
works.
is
there
something
different
about
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
their
view
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
texaco
product
being
a
product
that
comes
out
of
refineries
that
previously
belonged
to
texaco
or
the
texaco
product
being
gasoline
that
comes
out
of
either
refinery
but
is
sold
to
stations
labeled
texaco,
or
both?
which?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
could
see
how
that
could
be
a
violation
because
it's
possible
that
equilon,
if
left
on
its
own,
would
decide
that
its
best
marketing
strategy
was
sometimes
to
set
a
differential.
but
now
they
can't
do
that
because
the
two
parents
have
agreed
that
they
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
be
rather
like
pan
american
and
grace
saying
that,
panagra,
charge
whatever
price
you
want,
but
above
all,
don't
go
below
$50
because
remember,
we,
grace,
have
some
ships
out
there
and
we
want
people
to
take
the
ships.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
go
back
for
a
second.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
it
clear.
my...
my
belief...
i've
always
thought
that
citizens
publishing
was
a
case
where
the
district
court
said
that
the
formation
of
the
joint
operating
venture...
the
basic
formation,
which
involved
a
stock
acquisition...
violated
section
7.
and
then
they
created
a
decree.
and
the
question
was...
for
the
supreme
court
was
whether
the
district
court
was
right
in
holding
there
was
a
section
7
violation.
now...
now,
maybe
i'm
wrong
on
that.
i'll
go
back
and
look
at
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
so,
if
i'm
right
on
it,
then
what
we're
lacking
from
your
point
of
view
here
is
a
claim
that
this
whole
joint
venture
is
unlawful.
and
i
agree
with
you.
if
you
make
that
claim,
i
don't
think
the
ftc
can
insulate
it,
i
guess,
unless
there's
something
i
don't
know
about,
but
you're
not
making
the
claim
anyway.
so
here,
unlike
citizens
publishing,
we're...
we
have
to
deal
with
this
on
the
assumption
that
the
joint
venture
is
lawful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
how
to
get
out
of
that,
but
maybe
you
can
tell
me
i
can.
but
wait.
now,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
what
precisely
is
your
claim,
given
the
lawfulness
of
the
joint
venture?
one
part
i
see.
one
part
i
see
is
that
the
people
who
are
setting
the
prices
are
the
board
of
directors
of
a
venture
company
who
represent
shell
and
texaco.
now,
that
might
run
up
against
justice
scalia's
objection.
but
i
want
to
sure...
sure
i
have
all
of
them.
that
is,
i
want
to
know
if
there's
some
other
claim
you're
making
here
in
respect
to
an
agreement
between
shell
and
texaco
as
to
equilon's
prices.
and
if
so,
what
is
it
and
where
is
the
reference
in
the
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
7.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
that
might
be.
but
i
don't
want
you
to
forget
the
last
part
of
my
question,
which
for
me
was
the
most
important,
because
i
can
read
citizens
publishing,
but
it's
going
to
be
tough
for
me
to
find
in
the
record
any
claims
that
you
make
that
the
two
companies
have
agreed
as
to
price,
like
the
panagra
example.
that's
why
i
gave
it,
to
put
it
in
your
mind.
so
if
there's
anything
like
this
that
you're
claiming,
i'd
like
to
know,
or
is
your
total
claim
that
the
activity
of
shell
and
texaco
in
setting
the
price
of
equilon
is
to
have
their
representatives
on
the
equilon
board
of
directors
tell
equilon
what
price
to
sell?
or
is
there
something
else?
i
just
need
to
know.
is
it
just
that,
or
is
there
something
else
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
it
the
board
of
directors
that
did
that,
or
was
it
something
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
that...
that
sounds
like
the
complaint
that
you're
making.
we
have
a
problem,
say,
with...
with
the
newspapers
or
whatever
it
is.
it's
awfully
dicey
as
to
whether
they
should
form
this
joint
venture.
it's
going
to
eliminate
a
lot
of
competition.
but
now
what
you're
saying
is,
look,
at
the
very
least,
they
should
structure
it
in
a
way
that
the
independent
pricing
decision
is
made
by
equilon.
don't
structure
the
pricing
decision
so
that
bit
by
bit,
day
by
day
it's
made
out
by
six
people,
half
of
whom
represent
shell,
half
of
whom
represent
texaco.
i
can
see
that
as
an
argument.
this
is
more
restrictive
than
necessary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
get
me
that
far,
and
now
i...
i...
but
i
say
why
isn't
that
a
rule
of
reason
because
you're
really
fighting
the
structure
of
the
venture
they
come
up
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really?
suppose
we
walk
into
a
department
store.
in
the
department
store,
we
see
three
perfume
counters,
and
there
are
three
salesmen,
one
behind
each.
do
they
compete
in
price?
the
answer
is
obvious.
of
course,
not.
of
course--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
three
counters.
they
sell
perfume.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
they
don't
compete.
but
do
we
know
the
department
store
has
to
be
run
that
way?
i
mean,
maybe
some
places
it
isn't.
we
can't
prove
it
has
to
be
run
that
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
think
of
a...
think
of
a
mall.
think
of
a
bunch
of
shops.
maybe
it
doesn't.
maybe
they
could
compete.
the
reason
that...
the
law
says
they
don't
have
to
compete
is
because
the
law
thinks
in
general
it's
a
reasonable
way
to
run
a
department
store
without
forcing
your
sales
people
to
compete.
and
similarly,
a
joint
venture.
you
can't
prove
they
have
to
have
the
price
set
at
a
central
place,
but
the
reason
they
set
it
at
a
central
place,
because
it's
a
joint
venture.
and
that's
seems
to
me
what
the
cases
are
consistent
with.
you
tell
me
which
one
is
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
the
answer
is
no.
you're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that
were
a
real
rule
of
reason
argument,
did
you
waive
the
rule
of
reason
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
just
as
long
as
you
have
a
minute--
[laughter]
--i
take
it
that
their
point
was,
what
you
sort
of
said
there,
that...
that
they
had
agreed...
sorry.
forget
it.
