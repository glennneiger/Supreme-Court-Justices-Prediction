justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
nager,
on...
on
that
point,
i
have
a
factual
question
and
i
figured
i'd
get
it...
excuse
me...
get
it
out
on
the
table
at
the
beginning
so
you'd
know
what
at
least
is
bothering
me.
the
nub...
the
nub
of
your
factual
argument
is,
as
you
just...
just
stated
it,
there's
a
joint
venture
here
and
joint
ventures
price
their
products.
the
factual
question
that
i
have
is
this.
this
is...
or
the
preface
for
it
is
this.
this
is
a
joint
venture
that
has
continued
to
market,
in
effect,
the
same
product
that
the...
that
the
two
companies
marketed
beforehand,
and
it
has
done
so,
ostensibly,
under
the
old
brand
names.
therefore,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
joint
venture
doesn't
necessarily
disclose
that
there
is
a
new
product
as...
as
might
be
the
case
normally
which
you
would
expect
the
joint
venture
to
set
its
own
price
for.
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
joint
venture
is
clearly
going
to
cover
pricing,
the
joint
venture
agreements,
the
documents
that
indicated
the
joint
venture
at
the
beginning,
should
have
mentioned
pricing.
and
yet,
my
understanding
is
that
they
did
not
do
so,
and
in
fact,
the
claim
on
the
other
side,
as
i
recall
the
briefs,
is
that
when
the
government
looked
at
the
joint
venture,
prior
to
its
going
into
effect,
nothing
was
said
about
fixing
prices...
setting
prices.
so
my
question
is,
did
the
joint
venture,
as
indicated
by
documentation,
say
in
any...
so
many
words
that
the
joint
venture
is
going
to
set
prices
for
these
two...
or
for
the...
the...
whatever
it...
whatever
it
sells?
and...
and
number
two,
if...
if
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
should
we
regard
the
joint
venture
as
covering
pricing?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
were
two
questions.
which?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
a
document
that
we
could
look
at
that...
that
says
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
nager,
what
if
you
had
a...
a
crazy
kind
of
joint
venture...
or
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
so
crazy...
in
which
it
was
just
like
this
one?
the
two
companies
said
we're
going
to
form
a
joint
venture
to
market
these
products.
you
know,
we'll
use
one
fleet
of
trucks
and...
and
we'll
have
one
computer
to
determine
who
needs
gas
and
so
on.
but
each
company...
each
of
the...
the
principals
forming
the
venture
retained
the...
the
power
to
determine
the
price
of
the
gasoline
that
is
sold
under
their
brand.
and
then
6
months
later,
the
two
companies
get
together
and
they
decide
to
fix
the
price.
that
decision
would
be
subject
either
to
quick
look
or
per
se
analysis,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
assuming
there...
there
are,
indeed,
efficiencies
to
be
attained
by
it
so
that
it's
not
a
sham.
they
just
retained...
they
said,
look,
we're...
we're
still
using
our
old
brands,
ostensibly,
in
the
market
and
we're
retaining
the
power
to
set
the
price
individually
with
respect
to
the
gas
that
is
sold
under
those
brands.
so
no
sham.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you...
are
you
saying
in
practical
terms
that
my
hypothesis
is...
is
just
a
practical
impossibility?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
but...
no.
[laughter]
beyond...
be
candid.
i
won't
get
mad.
is...
is
that...
is
that
really
your...
your
point
that
i've
come
up
with
a
hypothetical
which
is
just
a
non
real
world
hypothetical?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
assuming
it
can
happen,
in...
in
that
case,
would
the
subsequent
agreement
as
to
price
be
subject
to
per
se
or
a
quick
look
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
there's...
there's
one
part
of
the
lot
that
you
haven't
thrown
in
together,
and
that's
the
pricing
lot.
in...
in
my
example,
your...
your
law
firm
agreement
would
be
each
partner
can
decide
exactly
what
he
wants
to
charge.
if...
if
one
wants
to
charge
$10,000
an
hour
and
another
wants
to
charge
$15
an
hour,
his
choice.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
agree.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
said
we're
going
to
do
it
on
the
hypothesis
that
it's
a
big
country
and
somewhere
out
there
somebody
might
do
this.
if...
if
two
oil
companies
did
it,
quick...
quick
look
or
per
se
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
didn't
we
have
competition
even
within
the
joint
venture
for
a
few
months?
because...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
on
the
facts.
i
thought
for
a
few
months
the...
the
price
differential
was
maintained.
i
think
there
was
a
2
cent
price
differential
or
something
like
that.
and
so
long
as
that
was
maintained,
weren't
they
competing?
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
there
competition
in...
in
the...
in
the
retail
market?
i
mean,
if
i
had
two
stations
in
front
of
me
and
one
was
selling
gas
2
cents
cheaper,
i'd...
i'd
go
to
the
one
that
was
2
cents
lower.
isn't
that
competition?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
that
differential
was
not
reflected
in
what
their
agreement
provided
that
each
could
respectively
take
out
of
the
joint
venture.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't...
isn't
it
expectable?
i
mean...
and
this
is...
i
think
this
is
justice
scalia's...
isn't
it...
isn't
it
expectable
that
if
you
don't
have
an
agreement
that
clearly
says
the
two...
the
two
joint
venturers,
respectively,
retain
the
right
to...
to
price
products
sold
to
the
consumer
under
their
brand
name,
that
in
fact
it
is
the
joint
venture
that
will
price
the
products?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
therefore,
it
is
a
decision
of
the
joint
venture,
not
of
the...
the
two
original
principals.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
mr.
minear--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
that's
true,
but
mr.
minear
had
a
response
to
that,
it
seems
to
me,
a
kind
of
blanket
response,
and
he
said
that's
only
relevant
unless
you
are
dealing
with
pricing
decisions
between
competitors.
and
the
one
thing,
if
i
understood
him
correctly,
that
is
clear
is
that
under
the
undisputed
portions
of
the
joint
venture
agreement,
the
price
at
which
the
products
were
sold,
high,
low,
differential,
no
differential,
did
not
affect
the
distribution
of
profits
as
between
the
two
joint
venturers.
therefore,
they
were
not
competing
with
respect
to
the
pricing,
and
therefore,
the...
your...
in
effect,
your
whole
argument
collapses
because
you
don't
have,
on
any
analysis,
an
agreement
between
two
competitors.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can
understand
your
argument
if
we
were
doing
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
is
that
something
that
can
properly
be
analyzed
on
quick
look
or
per
se?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
mr.
alioto,
your
argument,
i
think,
is
assuming
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
like
the
facts
in
what
i
think
i
called
my...
my
crazy
joint
venture
hypothetical
in
which
the
two
principals
agreed
to
a
joint
venture,
but
they
accept
in
a
clear
and
unequivocal
way
the
pricing
decisions.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
two
things
have
come
out
of
this
argument.
number
one,
you
don't
make
that
assumption,
and
that
assumption
is...
is
not
supported
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
number
two,
mr.
minear
comes
back
and
says
as
long
as
the
division
of
profits
under
the
joint
venture
agreement
does
not
depend
on
these
pricing
decisions,
they
are
not
competitors,
and
therefore
it's
irrelevant
anyway.
doesn't
your
argument
run
against...
crash
against
one
or
the
other
or
both
of
those
answers?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
did
not
change
the
price
for
at
least
8
months.
