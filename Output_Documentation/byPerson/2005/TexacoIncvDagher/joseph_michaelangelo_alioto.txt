mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
justice
souter,
in
answer
to
your
question
whether
or
not
they
advised
that
they
were
going
to
fix
the
prices
when
they
formed
the
venture,
the
answer
is
no.
in
answer
to
your
question
whether
or
not
they
had
any
document
advising
the
government
that
they
intended
to
fix
the
prices,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
shell
and
texaco
fixed
the
price,
if
it
please...
if
it
please
your
honor.
under
the
brand
management--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--yes,
your
honor,
and
at
page
5
of
our
brief,
we
pointed
that
out.
there
were
two
parts
to
it.
under
the
agreement...
and
if
you'll
look
at
page
5
of
our
brief,
we
have
both
of
the
agreements.
and
under
those
agreements...
under
those
agreements,
it
was
necessary
that
the...
i'm
sorry.
at
page
7.
under
those
agreements,
if
the
court
will
look
at
it,
first
of
all,
it
says,
the
company's
business
shall
be
conducted
by
the
ceo
and
other
officers
of
the
company,
subject
to
the
direction
by,
and
in
accordance
with
the
policies,
business
plans,
and
budgets
approved
by
shell
and
texaco...
they
said
the
members...
acting
by
and
through
the
members
committee.
that's
shell
and
texaco.
but
more
importantly--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--if
the
board
of
directors
are
shell
and
texaco
and
if
they
are
the
ones
who
are...
the
next
statement,
your
honor...
the...
they...
they
must...
the
company
must
follow
the
policies,
strategies,
and
standards
established
by
the
members
committee.
the
members
committee
is
shell
and
texaco
and
saudi.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
a
joint--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--the
pricing
didn't--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--the
pricing
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with...
if
it
please
the
court,
the
pricing
didn't
anything
to
do
with
the
joint
venture.
on
page
12--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
no,
your
honor,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
in
citizens
publishing,
that
did
not
exist.
this
court
did
not
abolish
the
joint
venture
there.
what
it
did
was
it
cut
out
the
price
fixing
part
of
it
only.
just
as
the
lower
court
said,
the
joint
venture
there
does
not
depend
upon--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
if
it
please
your
honor,
there
are
many
times
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
the
ftc
does
not
have
the
authority
or
power
to
grant
immunity
from
antitrust
violations.
in--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--yes,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
also
that
you
should
give
some
respect,
too,
to
this
court's
prior
orders
and
this
court's
prior
decisions.
in
citizens
publishing,
the
court
left
alone
the
joint
venture,
and
it
separated
out
the
pricing
and
took
it
out
and
cut
it
out.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
in
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
they
did
not
join
the
gasoline.
the
gasoline
was
separate
and
apart.
they...
that
was
very
important.
they
maintained
them
separate
and
apart.
they
competed
separately
for
at
least
8
months.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
i
believe
that
that's
probably
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
this
court
talked
about
in
bmi
and
the
other
cases.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
the
reason
it
loses
the
authority,
your
honor,
is
that
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
reasonably
necessary
means
so
they...
it
has
to
be
reasonably
necessary
that
they
need
to
price
the
products
in
order
to
make
the
joint
venture
work.
on
page
12,
we
gave
you
the
testimony
where
the
chief
executive
officer
of
texaco
and
others
specifically
said
that
the...
that
the
pricing
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
cost
savings
or
the--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--but,
justice
souter,
citizens
publishing...
they
did
exactly
the
same
thing.
they
pooled
their
profits
under
a...
under
a
formula
that
was
very
similar
to
the
formula
here.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
and
the
same
existed
here,
justice
scalia.
shell
and
texaco
were...
operated
basically
independently
for
at
least
8
months,
and
certainly
before
they
were
major
competitors.
but
look
what
happened
here.
all
of
the
costs
that
were...
all
of
the
cost
savings
in
this
situation...
there
are...
to
show
how...
to
show
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
what
happened,
in
this
case,
the
crude
oil
was
down
to
its
lowest
since
the
depression.
the
costs
were
being
reduced
under
the
so
called
joint
venture
substantially.
plus,
there
was
excess
supply.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
even--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--taking
each
of
the
questions
that
you
asked,
justice
breyer,
first,
citizens
publishing
was
section
1
and
2
and
subsequently--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--section
7.
okay.
second,
in
citizens
publishing,
the
lawfulness
of
the
joint
venture,
like
here,
even
if
you
posit
that
the
joint
venture
is
lawful,
it...
the
pricing
must
be...
must
be
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
those...
those
savings
in
order
to
be
justified.
when
there's
no
connection,
it's
just
a
straight,
naked
restraint,
and
even
if
it
were...
even
if
the
joint
venture
were
lawful
here,
even
if
that
were
so
and
they
had
all
these
cost
savings,
in
the
face
of
all
of
those
lowered
costs
and
the
lowest
crude
oil
and
the
excess
supply,
they
not
only
took
the
price
leader
and
the
price
cutter,
they
brought
them
to
the
same
level,
and
then
they
increased
the
price
another
67
percent
in
major
markets--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--they
want
to
maintain,
first
of
all,
their
independent
identity
just
like
citizens
publishing.
they
want
to
maintain
that.
they
had
a
standstill
agreement
you
can't
merge
these.
they
didn't
want
to
join
them.
they
didn't
want
to
make
a
new
product.
they
didn't
want
to
do
that.
all
they
wanted
to
do
was
fix
the
price
of
gasoline
in
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
there
is
more.
what
the...
okay.
what
they
did
is
when...
is
when
the
members
decided
that
they
wanted
a
new
plan...
this
is
after
6
months
that
they
had
been
operating
their
joint
venture
without
fixing
the
price.
they
then
had
a
program
that
they
submitted
that
they
required
equilon
and
motiva
to
follow.
and
this
was
their
so
called
strategic
price
plan.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
if...
if
you
want
to
say
that
the
members
committee
are
the
board
of
directors,
justice
breyer,
okay.
but
in
fact
and
in
truth,
it
is
the...
it
is
shell
and
texaco,
independently
without
any
conversation
with
the
representatives
of
equilon,
who
are
doing
this.
what
differences
this
from...
from
northern
securities
and...
and
any
of
the
other
cases
in
which
the
board
of
directors,
so
called,
were
the
former
major
competitors...
what
difference
what
form
they
take...
and
they--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--absolutely,
your
honor,
because
first
of
all...
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
citizens
publishing,
it
is
per
se.
secondly,
with
regard
to
quick
look,
look
what
you
have.
first
you
analyze
the...
as
we've
said...
as
you've
said
before
in
your
decisions,
first
you
analyze
the
restraint.
what
is
it?
it's
a
restraint
directly
on
price.
it's
not
covered
up
any
way.
it's
not
something
doing
something
like
less
supply
to
fix
the
price.
it's
directly
at
the
price.
the
second
thing
is,
in
doing
that,
is
this
restraint
necessary,
not
less...
not
much...
essential...
is
it
necessary
to...
to
get
the...
what
you're
saving
on
the
joint
venture?
is
it
necessary
to
promote
the
objectives
of
the
joint
venture?
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
they
are
not
the
same
commodity
because
they
said...
they
were
asked
and
they
said
it
was
different.
they
maintain
the
difference.
they
seem
to
think
that
it's
different.
secondly--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--that's
what
they
say,
your
honor.
secondly,
if
equilon
were
given
the
right
to
do
its
own
pricing,
if
they
had
given
all
of
that
right
to
them,
and
that
they
weren't
the
real
puppeteers,
as
it
were,
that
would...
might
be
a
different
situation.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
of
course.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
they
come...
then,
if
it
please
your
honor,
that
after
i
pointed
out
that
the
restraint
is
directly
on
price,
which
should
be
a
red
flag
to
anyone,
and
also
that
i
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
pricing
and
the
cost,
the
savings,
for
the
joint
venture,
the
last
issue
on
that
is
whether
there's
any
justification.
and
what
justification
is
there?
there's
none.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
justice
souter...
i
believe
a
number
of
answers
to
that,
justice
kennedy.
first
of
all,
this
is
so
temporary.
they've
done
this
for...
they
have
the
right
to
get
out
of
this
in
5
years.
they're
already
out
of
it.
it
doesn't
exist
anymore.
they
could
do
it
mutually
in
5
years.
they
could
do
it
by
themselves
after
5.
they
haven't
done
it
anywhere
else
in
the
world.
all
they're
doing
is
getting
together
and
being
able
to
fix
the
price.
so
it's
so
temporary.
what
difference
does...
really
does
that
make?
but,
in
addition,
it's
the
profit
pooling
that
was
also
illegal,
declared
to
be
illegal
by
this
court
in
its
7
to
1
decision
in
citizens.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
the
court
didn't
like
that
either.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
in
all
due...
in
all--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--in
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
the...
you
do
not
have
to
have
market
power
to
fix
prices.
that's
not
a
criteria.
that
is
certainly
not
a
predicate.
anybody
can
fix
prices.
you
fix
prices.
it's
illegal
per
se.
that's
the
point.
and--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--they
did
it.
[laughter]
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
it
wasn't
silly
for
them
to,
first
of
all,
change
the
differential
that
lasted
for
years,
and
it
wasn't
silly
for
them
to
increase
the
price
by
70
percent
as
soon
as
they
made
the
agreement.
there
was
nothing
silly
about
that.
many
people
suffered
because
of
it.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
if...
if...
in
the
face
of
the
facts
that
we
have
in
the
record...
and
that's
not
a...
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
fact.
let
them
present
it
to
a
jury
if
they
say
that
that's
the
reason.
when
they
have
a
situation
where
the
crude
oil
is
as
low
as
it's
ever
been
since
the
depression,
when
they
say
they've
saved
$850
million
on
their
joint
venture,
and
when
they
say
there's
excess
capacity,
even...
you
don't
need
to
be
adam
smith
to
know
that
the
prices
are
supposed
to
go
down.
and
what
happened
instead?
they
went
up
and
they
went
up
dramatically.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
pardon
me?
pardon
me,
justice?
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
per
se...
per
se
violations
are
put
to
juries
all
the
time,
justice
scalia.
the
question
is
you
have
to
prove
that
that's
what
they
did.
i
agree
with
the
court
in
this
way.
i
agree.
i
don't
think
it...
i
don't
think
it
should
go
to
trial.
i
think
this
court
should
do
as
it
did
in
citizens
publishing
and
make
it
very
plain
to
everybody
that
you're
not
going
to
allow
them
to
use
a
joint
venture
as
a
cover,
even
though
it
is
legal--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--to
go
do
something
unlawful.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
the...
the
joint
venture
was
not
declared
invalid,
justice.
the
joint
venture
was
preserved.
they
were
allowed
to
continue
to
keep
the
presses
together,
to
keep
the
trucks
together,
to...
to
use
the
joint
venture.
as
the
court
said
below
and
as
this
court
said,
the...
the
pricing
didn't
depend...
depend...
i
mean,
the
joint
venture
didn't
dependent
upon
the
pricing.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
they've
used
the
failing
company
doctrine,
your
honor,
both
in
northern
securities
and
in
citizens
publishing,
and
that
was
the...
that
was
the
reason
what...
which
they
gave
initially
to
join,
and
that
was
an
issue.
and
justice
harlan
said,
okay,
that
was
an
issue.
he
thought
that
that
should
be
tried.
but
that
was
not
pertinent
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
pricing,
if
it
is
so
divorced...
i...
i
must
bring...
bring
the
court
back
to
this
statement
by
the
chief
executive
officer.
he
said
that
the
cost
savings
and
all
the
synergies,
the
pricing
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
nothing
he
said.
so
if
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
then
what
are
they
doing
fixing
the
price?
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
let
me
say
it
in
this
way,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
shell
and
texaco,
if
they
got
together
and
they
say,
look
it,
we'll
get
rid
of
both
of
our
gasolines,
let's
just
have
one
gasoline,
and
they
fixed
the
price,
i
think
that
that
would
be
illegal.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
i
thought
what
the--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--but...
but
if
the
court--
[laughter]
if
it...
if
it
please
the
court,
if
equilon...
if
equilon
were
supposed
to
come
up
with
a
new...
with
a
new
product
itself...
i
mean,
the...
the...
your
cases
are
so
clear.
bmi
was
allowed
to
fix
the
price
because
they
came
up
with
a
product
that
nobody
could
do
on
their
own,
and
that
was
one
of
the
basic
reasons.
and
even
so,
the
people
who
made
the
agreement
continued
to
compete
against
the...
the
so
called
product
of
the...
of
the
joint
venture.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
only
if
it
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
joint
venture.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
this
court
has
been
consistently
clear
on
this
topic.
you
cannot
even
think
about
or
touch
price
unless
you
have
some
specific,
necessary
connection
to
the
joint
venture.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
three
sales
persons?
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
well,
this
would
be--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--the
danger...
the
danger,
justice
breyer,
is
this.
is
the
court
going
to
say
that
two
major
competitors
in
a
major
industry,
that
if
they
get
together
from...
for
some
joint
venture,
whatever
it
is,
that
they're
then
allowed
to
fix
the
price?
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
i
don't
think
so.
the
second
one
made
by
counsel
for
the
government
runs
directly
against
citizens
publishing.
that
was
in
the
case,
your
honor.
and
no
one
has
suggested
that
citizens
publishing
be
reversed.
and
the
second
part
is
in
fact
they
did
that.
they
did
act
independently
for
at
least
8
months.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
no.
in
between,
they
didn't...
they
didn't
change
the
price.
they
didn't
get
involved
in
the
price.
then
they
came
up
with
their
program
and
then
they
instructed
the
joint
venture
to
make
the
prices
the
same.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
not
the
joint
venture
doing
that.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
that
would
be--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--if
they
gave
them
independence
and
if
there
were
some
relationship
with
the
joint
venture--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--gave
equilon
and
to
motiva.
if
they
gave
them
independence
to
make
their
own
judgment...
maybe
equilon
would
like
to
make
texaco
a
lower
price.
maybe
it
like
to
make
it
a...
a
discounter.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
no.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
precisely
did
not.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
how
it
is
in
other
situations.
all
i'm
saying
is
when
you
have
these
two
oil
companies
who
are
directing
this
and
pretending
that
the
decisions
are
being
independent,
that
is
not
the
fact
in
this
case.
and
there's
nothing
wrong,
justice
souter,
for
two
of
these
to
read
the
way
they
did
because
they
did
it
in
our
case.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
shell
and
texaco
should
have
done
this.
they
should
have
said,
okay,
we're
making
equilon
for
these...
for
these
cost
savings.
you,
equilon,
can
make
the
price
decisions
if
you
want
to.
or
they
could
say,
you
make
the
gasoline,
give
it
to
us,
like
gm
and
toyota,
and
we
will
separately
price
it
on
our
own.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
they
did
not.
justice...
justice
scalia,
they
did
not.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
my
complaint
is--
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
--my
complaint
is
that
two
gasoline
companies
controlled
the
price
that
they
were
never
able
to
fix
before.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
i...
i
waived
the
rule
of
reason
argument
with
regard
to
showing
market
power
and...
and
impact
on
the
market.
i
chose
ncaa
under
the
footnote...
and
under
footnote
39
of
ncaa.
and
i
chose
price
fixing
per
se
on
the
basis
of
citizens
publishing.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
if
you
do
it,
as
was
noted
in
california
medical,
where
you
have
this
whole
line
from
per
se
to
the
end
on
rule
of
reason,
and
in
between
on
misty
flats,
no
one
is
sure
what
they
are,
but
we
now
know
i
am
getting
rid
of
the
final
one,
the
far
one.
but
i
am
not...
i
am
not
getting
rid
of...
and
i...
and
i
do
not
waive
the
rule
of
reason
based
on
the
so
called
quick
look
doctrine,
as
announced
by
this
court
on
a
number
of
occasions.
and
we
have
satisfied
all
of
those
requirements.
the
restraint
is
on
price
directly.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
yes,
on
impact
of
market.
mr.
joseph
michaelangelo
alioto
if
it
please
the
court,
thank
you,
your
honor.
