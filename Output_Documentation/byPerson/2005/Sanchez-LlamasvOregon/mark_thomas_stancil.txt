mr.
mark
t.
stancil
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mario...
mario
bustillo
was
not
advised
of
his
rights
under
article
36
in
direct
contravention
of
the
treaty.
as
a
result,
he
went
to
trial
for
first
degree
murder,
having
had
no
contact
with
a
consular
officer
from
his
home
country
and
being
completely
unaware
that
he
was
entitled
to
do
so.
the
virginia
courts
improperly
relied
upon
the
result
of
that
violation,
itself
the
product
of
failure
to
comply
with
the
treaty,
to
refuse
to
consider
critical
exculpatory
evidence
that
was
uniquely
in
the
possession
and
available
with
the
assistance
of
the
consular
officers.
that
evidence
would
have
included
official
government
immigration
records,
corroborating
a
key
defense
witness,
and
proving
that
the
alternative
suspect,
a
honduran
national,
known
as
sirena,
fled
to
honduras
the
day
after
the
victim
died.
the
honduran
consulate
also
would
have
provided
sirena's
address
and
attempted
to
interview
him.
indeed,
once
bustillo's
habeas
counsel
located
sirena
in
honduras,
he
obtained
a
surreptitiously
videotaped
confession
in
which
sirena
admitted,
in
chilling
detail,
to
committing
the
crime
and
acknowledged
that
mario
bustillo
had
been
wrongly
convicted.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
not
on
this
record,
your
honor,
but
the
honduran
consulate
has
offered...
has
said
it
would
have
attempted
to
locate
sirena
and
interview
him.
and
acting
with
far
fewer
resources,
before
the
honduran
consulate
was
even
aware
of
this
case,
petitioner's
habeas
counsel
got
this
confession,
the
point
being
it
wasn't
that
hard
to
get,
to
trick
this
person
into
admitting,
yes,
he...
he
committed
the
crime.
and
in
the
confession,
which
is
on
pages
33
to
55
of
the...
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
are
a
number
of...
of
details
in
that
confession
he
could
have
known
no
other
way.
moreover,
the
honduran
consulate
would
have
provided,
and
ultimately
did
provide,
a
photograph
of
sirena.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes.
however,
an
ineffective
assistance
claim...
and
i
should
back
up.
it
was
raised.
the...
the
habeas
court
disposed
of
it
on
two
grounds,
saying
it
was
beyond
the
statute
of
limitations
because
an
ineffective
assistance
claim,
based
on
the
vienna
convention,
did
not
relate
back,
but
also
denied
it
on
the
merits
and
said
it
wouldn't
have
met
the
strickland
standard
anyway.
but
the
ineffective
assistance
claim
is
ineffective
to
address
the
treaty
violation
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
treaty
gives
you
a
right
to
be
notified.
it
protects
the
special
relationship
between
a
consular
officer
and
the
detained
foreign
national,
and
channeling
these
claims
to
ineffective
assistance
doesn't
vindicate
that
separate
federal
right.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
correct.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
it's
not
elevated,
your
honor.
it's
actually
treated
more
like
the
right
it
resembles,
like
a
brady
right,
which
is
not
defaulted
if
you
don't
raise
it...
raise
it
at
trial,
for
three
reasons.
first,
like
a
brady
case,
a
vienna
convention
violation
resulting
in
the
exclusion
of
exculpatory
evidence
is,
by
its
nature,
not
known
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
a
brady
violation
is
a
closer
match
than
a...
for
example,
a
miranda
violation,
for
the
central
reason
that
the
consular
officer
and
the
foreign
national,
working
together,
know
best
whether
to
exercise
those
rights.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
as
an
initial
matter,
it's...
it's
not
perfectly
clear
in
the
record.
he
submitted
an
affidavit
stating
that
he
never
advised
clients
of
vienna
convention
violations,
but
it
does
not
say
on
this
record
that
he
knew
at
the
time
of
trial
about
the
vienna
convention.
but
even
granting
that
he
did,
the
attorney
is
not
in
the
position
to
make
that
decision.
this
case
illustrates
why,
and
this
is
my
second
reason
why
an
ineffective
assistance
claim,
justice
alito,
would
be
insufficient,
which
is
ineffective
assistance
trusts
strategic
decisions
about
whether
to
invoke
a
right
to
the
counsel,
but
the
counsel,
the
lawyer,
is
not...
is
not
in
a
position
to
make
that
decision
for
his
client.
as
this
case
illustrates,
even
assuming
that
the
counsel
knew
about
the
vienna
convention
right,
he
said,
well,
that's
more
trouble
than
it's
worth.
this
case
illustrates
precisely
why
we
don't
leave
those
decisions
with
the
lawyers.
first
and
foremost--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--because
that
cuts
out
an
entire
category
of
treaty
violations
where
it
may
have
been
a
strategic
decision
by
counsel
not
to
raise
it,
but
where
that
decision
is
ultimately
mistaken.
and
as
the
treaty
is
structured--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
i
should
back
up
and...
and
point
to
the
first
reason
why
a
lawyer
isn't
effective
in
making
this
decision
and...
and
first,
state
that
the
lawyer
here
never
told
mario
bustillo
about
the
vienna
convention.
so
it
isn't
that
situation
where
he
consulted
with
his
client
and
elected
not
to
raise
it.
he
didn't
even
tell
his
client.
but
more
fundamentally,
the
lawyer
operates
under
inherent
conflict
of
interest.
the
first
thing
the
consular
officer
does,
when
he
makes
contact
with
a
foreign
national,
is
decide
is
the
lawyer
that
he
has
good
enough.
in
fact,
it's
the
only
form
of
consular
assistance
that's
specified
in
the
text
of
the
treaty.
in
article
36(1)(c),
it
says
to
ensure
that
he
can
obtain
adequate
legal
representation.
so
the
lawyer,
who's
deciding
whether
to
get
the
consulate
involved,
has
to
think
in
the
back
of
his
mind,
well,
is
the
first
word
out
of
this
consular
officer's
mouth
going
to
be,
well,
you
know,
fire
this
guy
and
get
a
new
lawyer.
that's
why
we
don't
trust
those
rights
to
the
lawyer,
and
that's
why
the
treaty
doesn't
trust
those
rights
to
the
lawyer.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i'd...
i'd
like
to
correct
that
very
clearly.
as
soon
as
mr.
bustillo
got
new
counsel
on
direct
appeal--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--he
submitted
a
motion
to
remand
to...
back
to
the
trial
court,
saying
there's
a
vienna
convention
violation--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
it's...
the
virginia
courts
don't
paginate
the
record--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--it's
in
the
record,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
we
would
have--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--getting
back...
is
ineffective
assistance
sufficient?
yes.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
because
relying
on
the
lawyer
to
do
the
duty
of
the
state
does
not
effectuate
the
fundamental
interest
the
treaty
serves,
which
is
establishing
direct
contact
between
the
consular
officer
and
the
lawyer.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
leaving
aside
the
conflict
of
interest
that
the
lawyer
would
suffer
on
two
additional
reasons
why
the...
why
the
lawyer
is
not--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--he
was
retained.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
by
the
defendant's
family.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i'm
not
sure
i--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--is
there
international
authority
required--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--it
does
not.
first
and
foremost,
it
doesn't
vindicate--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
the...
well,
the
icj
has
held
that
you
can't
rely...
that
these
procedural
default
rules
are
not
adequate
to
vindicate
the
treaty
interests.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
in...
in
terms
of
ineffective
assistance?
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
believe
that
actually
would
not
be
the
practice
in
civil
law
countries,
for
example,
where
a
judge
as
the
inquisitor
has
much
more
flexibility
than
he
does
in
an
adversarial
system
when
and
whether
to
consider
evidence
that
may
or
may
not
have
come
in
at
a
certain
time.
but
i'd
like
to
get
back
to,
justice
souter,
your
question,
with
respect
to
two
additional
points
why
the
treaty...
and
i'm
not
saying
this
is
our
rule...
the
treaty
says
the
state
has
to
notify
and...
and
it
doesn't
say
the
lawyer
has
to
notify.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
and
again,
ineffective...
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
doesn't
give
full
effect
because
under
this
court's
cases,
if
it's...
if
it's
in
the
rubric
of
ineffective
assistance,
you
leave
strategic
decisions
to
the
lawyer,
and
so
if--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
in
that
sense,
it's
very
much
like
the
rule
this
court
laid
down
in
federal
cases
in
massaro
where
it...
it
explained
just
the
practical
difficulties
associated
with
requiring
claims
that
need,
for
example,
a
prejudice
record,
and
everybody
believes
that
a
prejudice
showing
would
need
to
be
made
before
you
could
establish
a
violation.
but
here,
we'd
have
to...
we
have
to
go
back
and
we
need
the
tools
of
post
conviction
review
to
establish
prejudice.
and
here,
once
we
got
there...
this
is...
this
is
not
speculation.
this
is
a
lawyer
made
a
strategic
decision,
he
says,
not
to
tell
his
client.
and
then
we
tried
to
raise
an
ineffective
assistance
claim,
and
the
court
said...
in
addition
to
saying
it
was
barred
for
other
reasons,
said
that
doesn't
meet
strickland.
this
is
that
category
of
treaty
violations
that,
if
you
push
these
claims
to
ineffective
assistance,
they
evaporate,
and
that
does
not
get--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--your
honor,
it's
no
more
of
an
exception
than
brady,
which
is
exactly
the
same
situation
where
you
have
a
right
that
you
don't
know
either
the
violation
has
occurred,
because
they
didn't
tell
him
and
his
lawyer
didn't
tell
him,
and
you
don't
know
the
evidence
that
could
have
been
developed.
here,
once
that...
once
that
missing
piece,
that
one
critical
part
of
article
36,
direct
notification
and
contact
with
the
consulate,
once
that
key
is
removed,
everything
else
follows.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
we
believe
it
is,
in
part,
because
this
is
an
affirmative
obligation
on
the
state.
miranda
is
a
rule,
for
example,
that
requires
you
to
say
what
the...
the
rules
of
the
game
are
and
this
is
how
it
works.
this
is
different.
this
is
fundamentally
different.
this
says,
you've
got
to
tell
him
individually
to
go
out...
you've
got
to
tell
him
that
he
has
a
right
to
go
out
and
ask
somebody
for
help,
and
it
gets
him
access
to
resources
that
are
uniquely
within
the
possession
and
control
of
a
consular
officer.
the
government
immigration
records.
the
consular...
the
lawyer
could
not
have
gotten
those
records.
they
were
crucial
to
the
defense.
more
fundamentally,
the
lawyer
didn't
even
know
those
existed
so
even
if
you
would
assume
that
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
could
remedy
violations...
and...
and
we
certainly
believe
this
case
and
a
large
category
of
other
cases
could
never
be
remedied
through
ineffective
assistance
claims
as
a
practical
matter.
even
then,
all
it
does
is
breed
ineffective
assistance
claim
after
ineffective
assistance
claim
because
the
trial
lawyer
doesn't
know
what's
in
the
embassy
file.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
the
case.
in
fact...
and
our
research
has
revealed
that
about
60
ineffective
assistance
claims
based
on
the
vienna
convention
violations...
it's
ambiguous
as
to
whether
there's
one
or
none
where
the
court
has
granted
relief
either
on
prejudice
grounds
or
performance
grounds.
so
litigants
have
tried,
but
that
just
shows
what
a
poor
fit
ineffective
assistance
claims
are.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
we
did
file
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
in
the
state
habeas
petition.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
the...
the
circuit
court...
we
then
tried
to
amend...
habeas
counsel
tried
to
amend
the
petition
to
specify
an
additional...
that
to
include
within
that
ineffective
assistance
claim
the
failure
to
notify.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
first
briefly
address
two
points
on
behalf
of
mr.
sanchez
llamas.
first,
with...
with
respect
to
him,
the
question
is
how
to
give
full
effect
to
the
treaty
in
the
context
of
custodial
interrogation,
and
his
position
is
that
suppression
is
necessary
to
give
full
effect.
and
we
need
look
no
further
than
the
fact
that
the
custodial...
that
the
remedies
that
are
currently
afforded
in
a
context
of
custodial
interrogation
are
ineffective.
and
secondly,
admitting
evidence
encourages
violations,
and
that'sl
been
the...
the
result
that's
been
a
constant
pattern
and
practice
of
violations.
if
i
could
switch
back
to
mr.
bustillo's
case,
and
i'd
like
to
address
what
mr.
garre
just
said,
which
is
that
there's
a
presumption
or
that...
that
treaties
don't
create
individually
enforceable
rights.
every
decision
of
this
court
is
unambiguously
clear.
where
you
have
a
treaty
that
becomes
part
of
the
domestic
law...
here
it
is.
where
that
treaty
creates
rights...
here
the
treaty
says
his
rights.
and
third
and
critically,
where
you
have
a
cause
of
action
to
enforce
those
rights,
it
is
judicially
enforceable
as
a
matter
of
domestic
law.
regardless
of
the
international
dimension
of
the
treaty,
as
a
matter
of
domestic
law,
it
is
enforceable.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
disagree,
your
honor.
if...
if
you
look
at
the
treaty's
text,
it
says,
you
shall
notify
the
person
affected
of
his
rights.
it's
referring
to
the
foreign
national
specifically.
and
twice
more,
article
36(2)
talks
about
the
rights
that
are
created.
these
all
flow
directly
to
the
foreign
national.
he
decides
whether
to
exercise
them.
this
is
a
classic
rights
creating
piece
of...
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a
statute,
but
it's
treated
on
par.
and
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--availability
of
a
cause
of
action.
here--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--the
virginia
habeas
statute
provides
a
cause
of
action
if
you
are
held
in
violation
of
federal
law,
and
in
sanchez
llamas,
the
cause
of
action
is
the
criminal
prosecution.
that's
what
the
court
did
in
rauscher
where
it
allowed
him
to--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--the
cause
of
action,
just
like
1983,
allows--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--that's
not
correct.
just
like
1983
has
to
create
a
cause
of
action
to
vindicate
federal
rights,
here--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--not
automatically,
but
if
you
have
a
statute
that
said
his
rights
and
refers
rights
and
makes
it
his
obligation
and
his
decision
whether
to
invoke
them,
it
would
be
classic
rights
creating.
if
i--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
would...
i
would
compare
the
language
of
article
36(2)
to
any
of
the
rights
cases
this
court
has
decided.
if
i
could,
in
my
remaining
minute,
describe
why...
and
this
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
we
were
talking
about
with
the
procedural
bar.
if
the
question
is,
as
justice
breyer
put
it,
whether
pushing
these
claims
to
ineffective
assistance
is
self
defeating,
we
have
ample
evidence
here
that
it
is.
the
state
says,
well,
it
may
or
may
not
be
ineffective
assistance.
the
state
court
said
it
wasn't
ineffective
assistance.
that's
because
trial
counsel
doesn't
have
unique
experience
and
knowledge
necessary
to
make
these
decisions.
that's
why
the
treaty
expressly
puts
it
in
the
hands
of
the
foreign
national
to
make
these
