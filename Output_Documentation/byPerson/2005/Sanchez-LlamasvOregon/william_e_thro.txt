mr.
william
e.
thro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
vienna
convention
does
not
create
judicially
enforceable
individual
rights.
nevertheless,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
it
does
create
individual
rights,
those
treaty
claims
should
not
be
treated
more
favorably
than
constitutional
claims.
in
virginia,
if
a
criminal
defendant
has
a
miranda
claim
or
a
fourth
amendment
claim
and
fails
to
raise
it
at
trial,
he
may
not
raise
it
on
collateral
review.
the
same
reasoning
should
apply
with
respect
to
any
violation
of
the
vienna
convention.
there's
no
reason
to
elevate
a
treaty
claim
above
a
miranda
claim
or
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
mr.
william
e.
thro
yes,
your
honor.
if...
if
this
court
were
to
announce
a
new
rule
that
the
vienna
convention
confers
individual
rights,
and
if
counsel
failed
to
raise
that
at
trial,
and
if
that
failure
constituted
ineffective
assistance
under
the
standard
articulated
in
strickland
v.
washington,
then
it
would
be
permissible
for
that
criminal
defendant
to
raise
it
in
his
collateral
review.
yes.
and
in
fact,
mr.
bustillo
attempted
to
raise
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
did
raise
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
in
the
state
trial
court.
that
claim
was
denied,
and
for
whatever
reason,
he
chose
not
to
appeal
that
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
mr.
william
e.
thro
yes.
it
was
on
state
collateral
review,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
thro
it...
it
was
raised
in
the...
in
the
state
trial
court,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
thro
but...
but
what
was...
and
the
state
trial
court
chose
to
deny
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
on
a
variety
of
reasons,
and
it
was
chosen...
he
chose
not
to
appeal
that
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
william
e.
thro
appellate
counsel
on
direct
appeal
attempted
to
raise
it.
he
filed
a
motion
requesting
a...
a
remand.
that
motion
was
denied
as...
as
improper.
then
in...
once
the
conviction
had
been
affirmed
by
the
virginia
court
of
appeals,
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
and
review
had
been
denied
by
this
court,
he
went
back
and
filed
a
collateral
review
claiming
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
for,
among
other
things,
failure
to
raise
the
vienna
convention.
the
trial
court
denied
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
and
then
there
was
no...
and
then
the
decision
was
made
not
to
pursue
that...
the
appeal
of
the
denial
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
william
e.
thro
there
were
several
reasons
for
the
denial,
one
of
which
was
statute
of
limitations,
but
the
court
also
noted
that
even
if
it
had
been
made
within
the
statute
of
limitations,
there
was
no
merit
to
it.
the
record
reflects,
your
honor,
that
mr.
bustillo's
retained
trial
counsel
was
fully
aware
of
the
vienna
convention
claim.
in
fact,
he
was
the
son
of
salvadoran
diplomats
and
was
familiar
with
vienna
convention
issues.
he
made
a
strategic
decision
that
it
would
be
better
to...
to
contain
his
client
and
to
contain
the
amount
of
people
talking
to
his
client
and,
therefore,
he
should
not
raise
the
vienna
convention
issue
at
trial.
and
that
is
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
of
retained
counsel,
set
forth
on
pages
318
through
319
of
the
habeas
record
in
the
fairfax
county
circuit
court.
mr.
william
e.
thro
yes,
he...
yes,
he
did,
your
honor,
and
having
grown
up
as
the
son
of
diplomats,
he
was
obviously
familiar
with
diplomats
and
their
behavior
in
social
settings.
and
it
was
feeling
and
his
strategic
view
that
his
client
was
better
off
not
raising
and
not
contacting
the
consulate.
but,
again,
this
goes
back
to
the
basic
point
that
justice
kennedy
raised
earlier.
in
america,
we
give
all
criminal
defendants,
regardless
of
nationality,
a
lawyer
to
represent
them.
we
charge
that
lawyer
with
knowing
their
rights
and
with
vindicating
their
rights,
with
making
the
objections
necessary
to
vindicate
miranda
rights,
with
making
the
necessary
objections
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment.
the
vienna
convention
should
be
no
different.
if
this
treaty
does,
in
fact,
create
judicially
enforceable
individual
rights,
then
the
attorneys
who
are
appointed
or
to
represent
these
people
will
know
about
that
and
will
be
responsible
for
vindicating.
that's
how
we
do
things
in
the
american
system.
mr.
william
e.
thro
no.
no,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--well,
i
will
certainly
attempt
to
do
so.
i...
i
think
the
flaw
in
the
icj's
reasoning
is
failure
to
recognize
that
in
the
united
states
all
criminal
defendants
are...
are
given
an
attorney,
and
that
that
attorney
is
charged
with
providing
constitutionally
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
meaning
being
aware
of
all
of
the
constitutional
rights
and
all
of
the
federal
and
state
statutory,
presumably
federal...
federal
treaty
rights
as
well.
there's
no
doubt
that
no
virginia
official
informed
mr.
bustillo
of
his
opportunity
to
contact
the
consulate,
but
it
is
also
clear
that
his
retained
counsel
knew
of
it
and
chose
not
to
pursue
it.
now,
that
may
or
may
not
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
it
does
not
justify
setting
aside
the
state's
procedural
bars
on
collateral
review,
which
would
apply
for
a
miranda
violation
or
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
i
would
also
note,
your
honor,
that
the
united
states
is
unique
in
the
world
in
having
the
extensive
system
of
collateral
review
for
criminal
convictions.
most
of
the
rest
of
the
world
doesn't
have
a
method
of
collateral
attack.
so
if
the
rest
of
the
world
doesn't
have
to
have
a
method
of
collateral
attack,
it
seems
rather
disingenuous
to
suggest
that
the
united
states
has
to
modify
our
rules
of
collateral
attack
in
order
to
accommodate
the
treaty.
mr.
william
e.
thro
i...
i
don't
think
that...
that
he
is,
your
honor.
however,
the...
a
defense
counsel
would
be,
if
this
court
were
to
announce
a
new
rule...
would
be
charged
with
the
knowledge
and,
therefore,
could
i
think
correct
any
error
that
may
have
been
made
by
the
failure
of
the
local
officials
or
the
national
officials
to
inform
the
criminal
defendant
of
his
opportunity
to
contact
the
consulate.
mr.
william
e.
thro
your...
your
honor,
i
would
refer...
i...
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
the
affidavits
of...
of
the
retained
counsel.
he
made
that
as
a
strategic
judgment.
obviously--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--i--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
we
would
disagree
as
to
whether...
as
to
the
extent
of
the
prejudice.
i
believe
that
his
affidavit
in...
both
with
respect
to
the
vienna
convention
claim
and
his
previous
affidavit
with
respect
to
just
other
varieties
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims,
indicates
that
he
had
some
concern
about
the
credibility
of
some
these
witnesses
who
were
identifying
mr.
sirena.
but
in
any
event,
he
made
that
strategic
judgment.
the
trial
court
said
that
it
was
not
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
for
whatever
reason,
that
judgment
was
not
appealed
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
mr.
william
e.
thro
that's
perhaps
so,
your
honor,
and
that's
one
thing...
thing
that,
whatever
rule
you
craft,
you
need
to
be
very
careful
of
and
that
is
preventing
gamesmanship
on...
on
the
part
of
attorneys
and
criminal
defendants
so
that
these
vienna
convention
claims
are
not
raised
after
the
fact,
which
is
another
reason
to...
to--
mr.
william
e.
thro
--yes,
your
honor,
he
would.
mr.
william
e.
thro
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
would
obviously...
if
this
court
announced
a
new
rule,
then
that
would
perhaps
change
the
thing.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
