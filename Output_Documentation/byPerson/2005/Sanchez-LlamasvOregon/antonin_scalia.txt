justice
antonin
scalia
that
court
is
not
a
common
law
court,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
not
being
a
common
law
court,
it's
not
bound
by
its
own
prior
decisions,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
its
statute
says
that
it...
it
decides
the
particular
case
and
does
not
set
forth
propositions
of
law
that
are
binding
in
future
cases.
if
it's
not
bound
by
its
prior
cases,
i
don't
know
why
we
should
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
remedies
have
other
countries
provided
for...
for
these
rights?
i
mean,
it's...
it's
easy
to
say
the
right
exists.
what...
what
have
other
countries
done
by
way
of
vindicating
these
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
advising
them
of
them
is...
is
really
not
vindicating
them,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's...
but,
you
know,
that's
what
the
other
side
said
the
whole
thing
should
consist
of,
that
it's
a
matter
to
be
enforced
by...
by
state
to
state
protests,
not...
not
by
the
judicial
system
or
the
legal
system
taking
it
upon
itself
to
provide
a
remedy.
what...
what
remedies
have
been
provided
in...
in
other
countries?
you...
you
mentioned
an
exclusion
in
australia?
justice
antonin
scalia
when...
when
was
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
just
a
source
of
authority
but
not
a
source
of
authority
for
suppression.
and
i
find
it
implausible
that
we
signed
a
treaty
which
requires
us
to
suppress
evidence
of
this
sort,
but
allows
the
other
treaty
partners
to
do
whatever
they
like,
not...
not
suppress,
let
it
in,
rely
upon
consular
protests.
is...
is
that
what
this
provision,
you
know,
in
accordance
with
domestic
law,
means,
that...
you
know,
each
man
to
himself?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
give
you
a
warmer
feeling
inside,
but
do
you
think
that
the
foreign
consulate
is...
is
more
likely
to
give
you
good
advice
about
what
you
should
do
under
american
law
than
an
american
lawyer
that
you've
been
provided?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i'm
just
saying
whether
it
makes
any
difference.
i
mean,
you're
talking
about
anything
that...
that
affects
substantive
rights.
he's
been
provided
an
attorney
who
knows
american
law
better,
presumably,
than...
than
a
consular
official.
what...
other
than
the
comfort
of...
of
speaking
to
somebody
from
his
own
country,
what...
what's
the
substantive
harm
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
we
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
we'd
have
to
make
an
8-hour
ruling
in
this
case
anyway
if...
if
we
agree
with
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
what
about...
what
about
countries
that
don't
have
an
extensive
telephone
system,
you
know,
where
you...
you
have
to
send
a
runner
to
notify
the
consul?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it...
it
just
makes
me
think
that...
that
instant
contact
is
not
what
was
envisioned
by
the
treaty.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
come
back
to
the
conflict
of
interest?
was...
was
this
lawyer
a
compensated
lawyer,
or
was
he
a
public
defender?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
retained.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
whom?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
that
australian
case
that
was
mentioned,
i
believe
one
case
where
at
least--
justice
antonin
scalia
--evidence
was
excluded?
that
would
have
been
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
thought
you
said
the
third
condition
was
creation
of
a
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
is
that
in
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
meant
the
statute
has
to
create
a
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the...
the
treaty
has
to
create
a
cause
of
action.
