justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
a
showing
of
prejudice
in
that
case
or
just
automatic
exclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that's
assuming
a
causal
link,
which
is
an
altogether
different
problem.
but
it's
still
not
clear
to
me.
are
you
saying
that
we
should
require
the
states
to
follow
and
the
united
states
government
to
follow
an
exclusionary
rule
because
that's
what
the
treaty
requires
or
because
this
is
the
remedy
that
we
ought
to
devise
in
the
exercise
of
our
supervisory
powers?
and
if
it's
the
latter,
it
seems
to
me
surely
there
must
be
some
causal
linkage
between
the
violation
and
the...
and
the
statement
at...
at
a
minimum.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of
the
things...
and
i...
i
really
have
this
question
for
all
counsel.
if
the
miranda
warning
is
given,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
comprehends
the
relief
that
you
need.
if
the
accused
talks
with
his
attorney,
his
attorney
is
presumed
to
know
the
treaty's...
the
provisions
of
the
convention.
if
he
does
not,
he
proceeds
at
his
risk.
attorneys
have
lots
of
things
they
can
tell
clients,
and
if
you
don't
have
an
attorney,
you
proceed
at
your
risk.
i
just
think
this
is
a
very
important
point
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you...
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
to
say
that
we're
holding
our
attorneys
to
the
same
standard
of
evaluation
as
the
attorneys
in
syria--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and...
and
our
bar
is...
is
not
to
be
trusted
to
have
the
expertise
that's
at
least
equivalent
to
that
of
the
foreign
counsel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
question
is
who
tells
you
about
that
choice,
and
your
attorney
can
tell
you
about
that
choice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
the
honduran
government
offered
to
arrest
and
extradite
that
witness
from
honduras
to
bring
him
back
to
the
united
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
the
same
point
we've
been
covering,
but
all
seem
to
concede
that
the
particular
characteristics
of
a
national
system
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
and
the
distinguishing
feature
of
our
system
is
that
it's
an
adversary
system.
and
you're
asking
us
to
make
an
exception
to
that
system--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--an
exception
to
the
usual
rules
that
prevail
in
that
system,
and
that's
not
consistent
with
what
the
treaty
requires.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
because
in
brady,
as
justice
souter
has
already
pointed
out,
there's
a
factual
piece
of
evidence
that
the
state
has
withheld.
here,
the
lawyer
is
presumed
to
know
the
law.
it's
just
not
an
apt
analogy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us
what
the
state
of
oregon
has
done
in
this
regard--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
other
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
do
you
think
it
should...
you
think
the
police
officer
should
give
it
as
part
of
the
miranda
warnings,
or
what's...
what's
your
conclusion
as
to
how
it
should
be
implemented?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
this
mean
that
the...
the
desk
sergeant
in
the
police
station
or
who?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
it's...
it's
not...
it's
not
required
for
police
interrogators
in
the
station
to
include
this?
they
can...
they
can
wait?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
about
during
the
interrogation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
like
rocket
science.
you've
had
study
groups
and
everything.
well,
you
just
tell
the
policemen
give
them...
give
them
the
advice.
end
of
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
easy.
if
you
are
a
foreign
national,
you...
that's
easy
too.
i
don't...
i
don't
see
why
this
is
so
complicated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
their
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
answer...
your
answer
doesn't
give
me
confidence
that
you're
implementing
the
treaty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
just
as
a
practical
matter,
what
we
have
here,
how...
how
should
the
states
enforce
this
obligation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
they
have
any
obligation
to
inquire
whether
he
is?
and...
and
can
you
be
more
specific?
should
it
happen--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
you
first
give
him
the
miranda
warnings,
or
tell
me
how
you
think
it
should
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
they
have
the
affirmative
obligation
to
ask
him
if
he
is
a
foreign
national?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
you
indicated
that
you
advise
the
states
that
they
do
have
to
advise
him
of
this
right
during
the
booking
process
or
the
interrogation.
