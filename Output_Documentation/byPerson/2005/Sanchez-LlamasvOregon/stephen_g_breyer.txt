justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
they
don't
do
it.
they
don't
do
it.
they
violated
the
treaty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
assume
that.
then
the
question
is
what
is
a
proper
remedy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'll
assume
with
you,
for
the
moment,
that...
that
the
treaty
has
to
be
read
as
saying
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
appropriate
remedy,
but
it
doesn't
say
what
kind.
so
why
isn't
it
an
appropriate
remedy
that
he
was
given
a
lawyer,
if
he
wanted
one,
and
the
lawyer
either
told
him
about
the
right
to
talk
to
the
consul
or
he
didn't.
and
if
he
didn't...
if
he
did,
he
found
out,
and
if
he
didn't
and
it
mattered,
maybe
that
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
so
if
we
have
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
to
take
care
of
the
tough
cases
where
it
really
did
matter,
doesn't
that
suffice
under
the
treaty,
or
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
he's
stuck
without
an
attorney.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
treaty
was
violated.
i
follow
you
that
far,
but
now
you're
talking
about
the
domestic
court's
power
to
do
what
there
is
an
international
obligation
to
do,
which
is
to
create
a
remedy.
i'm
not
sure
why
that
remedy
need
always
be
suppression.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
sometimes
it
could
be
something
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
the
ultimate
question
i
think
is
the
one
justice
alito
asked.
i
think,
as
i
read
the
icj
treaty,
we're
under
a
legal
obligation
in
this
country
to
provide
a
reasonable,
effective
remedy.
and
why
isn't
that
a
reasonably
effect
remedy?
treat
it,
you
know,
like
any
other
problem
where
the
client
should
have
learned
something
and
he
didn't.
if
the
lawyer
is
there,
this
is
obligation.
the
lawyer
tells
him,
and
if
the
lawyer
fails
to
tell
him,
then
that's
ineffective
assistance
in
an
appropriate
circumstance,
or
if
it
isn't,
it
isn't.
but
that's
a
good
remedy.
what's
wrong
with
that?
and
the
other
obligation
is,
counsel,
you
have
to
raise
this
issue
as
soon
as
everybody
learns
about
it,
in
which
case
you
might
be
out
because
i
don't...
he's
certainly
learned
about
it
by
the
time
he
was
on
appeal,
and
as
i
read
your
brief
here,
he
didn't
raise
it
on
appeal
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
said...
when
i
read
that
motion,
which
i'll
do...
so
it's
in
the
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
i
have
it
in
front
of
me
somewhere?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
okay.
now,
in
other
words,
he
did
raise
it.
okay.
if
he
did
raise
it,
then
maybe
he
would
be
entitled
to
this
relief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is...
my
general
question
is,
is
that
approach
sufficient
under
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
say,
in
an
appropriate
case,
i
can't
find
a
rule
for
every
case...
but
that
our
obligation,
as
interpreted
by
the
icj,
is
that
we
have,
as
the
law
of
the
land,
a
treaty
that
says
you
tell
the
person
about
his
vienna
convention
right,
and
if
you
don't,
now
says
the
icj,
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of...
of
effective
remedy.
now,
assuming
that's
the
law
of
the
united
states,
why
isn't
this
approach
an
effective
remedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there...
there
are
rules
on
conflicts
of
interest
too,
you
know.
so
following
our
normal
rules,
is
there
any
country,
is
there
any
international
law,
is
there
anything
in
american
law
that
would
suggest,
in
respect
to
any
kind
of
significant
procedural
failure,
that
the
state
has
to
do
more
than
we're
just
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anywhere.
i...
i
just
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--think
for
our
most
severe
violations,
we
provide
an
approach
that
you
tell
the
lawyer.
the
lawyer
brings
it
up.
if
the
lawyer
doesn't
bring
it
up
and
it's
important
or
there's
a
conflict
of
interest
or
something
terrible
is
going
on,
normally
you'd
say
that's
ineffective
assistance.
and
i
just
wonder
if
that
approach
doesn't
work
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
not
interested
in,
now
at
the
moment,
whether
it
does
or
does
not
work.
i
want
to
know
if
there's
any
country
or
anywhere
else
in
american
law
or
international
law
where
people
have
gone
further
than
that.
and
there
might
be.
i'm
asking
it
seriously.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
a
procedural
default
rule.
i'm
talking
about
the
system
that
was
suggested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
the
procedural
default
rule
would
mean
you
get
procedurally
defaulted
if
you
fail
to
bring
it
up,
but
i
think
you
might
say
if
you
failed
to
bring
it
up
the
first
time
that
the
lawyer
knew
about
it.
and
if
it's
his
fault
for
not
bringing
it
up
or
he
should
have
known
about
it,
then
he's
out...
the
client.
but
if
it's
not,
he's
not
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
there
been
any
courts
that
have
held
the
contrary?
have
there
been
courts
that
said
when
somebody
wasn't
notified
and
they
sought
to
obtain
some
remedy
for
that,
that
even
though
the
treaty
has
been
violated,
you
have
no
remedy
under
our
system?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
are...
which
is
the
best
authority
abroad
for
you
that...
where
they
say,
no,
we're
sorry,
we
give
you
no
remedy,
even
though
we
violated
the
treaty?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
holding?
they...
they
held
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
have
a
lower
court
opinion
in
canada,
and
you...
and
they
have
a
lower
court
opinion
in
australia.
is
it
fair
if
i
come
to
the
conclusion
no
one
has
ever
really
decided
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if...
then
if
that's
fair,
is
it
fair
also
for
us
to
say
that...
that
we
have
to
take
this
treaty,
since
it's
self
executing,
as
if
it
were
written
into
american
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
fair?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
if
that's
fair,
then
suppose
you're
coming...
suppose
the
treaty
had
said...
and
it's
part
of
american
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
didn't
say
this,
but
suppose
it
had.
you
have
to
inform
this
individual,
and
if
you
don't
inform
the
individual,
you
have
to
give
him
a
remedy
so
that
he
is
not
prejudiced
thereby.
now,
if
it
had
said
that
and
the
state
or
the
federal
government
refused
to
give
him
a
remedy
and
it's
part
of
american
law,
wouldn't
we
have
to
say
that
american
law,
federal
law,
treaty
law
requires
you
to
do
that
rather
than
what
you're
doing,
if
it
had
said
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
once
we're
there,
it
seems
to
me
what
we're
arguing
about
is
not
this
metaphysical
thing
about
rights.
we're
arguing
about
what
the
treaty
says.
now,
if
that's
so,
i...
i
think
we're
back
to
where
we
were
in
the
last
case
and
say
does
this
treaty
or
does
it
not,
as
a
matter
of
american
law,
say
that
the
person
is
entitled
to
some
kind
of
remedy.
and
our
problem
there
is
that
the
icj
has
said,
yes,
it
does,
but
it
doesn't
mention
it,
but
it
does
say
that
you
cannot
have
procedural
rights
that
do
not
give
full
effect
to
the
purpose
of...
of
this
section.
so
where
are
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the...
the
thing
i
found
stronger
the
other
way,
which
you
can
answer,
is
that
ordinarily,
i
guess,
since
they
quote
in
one
these
amicus
briefs,
since
at
least
1927
we
consider...
our
state
department...
the
treaties
that
have
obligations
are...
also
require
appropriate
enforcement
remedies,
et
cetera.
and
we
have
avena
and
we
have
lagrand,
and
there
the
icj,
as
i
read
it,
has
said
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
remedy,
being
pretty
vague
about
what
kind
it
is.
all
right.
so
normally
we
follow
the
icj,
if
we
can.
schooner
betsy
and
go
back
forever.
so
why
not?
just
follow
what
they
say,
say
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
remedy.
and
then
we
put
our
minds
to
figuring
out
what
that
kind
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
a
couple--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thinking
of
the
wrong
thing,
but
it
seemed
to
me
i
have
a
couple
of
opinions
here
on
habeas,
state
habeas,
where
they
did
raise
it.
am
i
thinking
of
the
other
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
not
on--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
then
the...
then
the
only
question
really
is
this
thing
that
i
find
metaphysical,
and
maybe
you
can
explain
it.
to
start
talking
about
the
individual
rights
that...
enforceable,
that
sounds
to
me
like
a...
you
know,
a
case
that
arises
under
1983
or
something.
but
i
thought
we
don't
need
that
concept.
we
all
agree
that...
that
this...
this
is
the
law
of
the
united
states.
it's
self
executing.
and
the
only
question
is
whether
the
action
here
violates
a
provision
of
the
treaty,
which
is
the
law
of
the
land.
what
else
is
there?
and...
and
the
only
thing
i
read
that
the
icj
said,
it
said,
by
the
way,
i'll
tell
you
what
kind
of
procedural
rule
you
can't
have.
you
can't
have
a
procedural
rule
that
says
after
you
failed
to
inform
him
of
the
right
and
after
he's
unbelievably
prejudiced,
you
say
he
can't
raise
it
because
he
didn't
raise
it
before
he
could
possibly
have
found
out
about
the
right.
that
would
be
self
defeating.
so
you
can't
have
that
kind
of
a
rule.
now,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
explain
to
me
where
i...
where
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wonder
what
that
means.
suppose
that
the
treaty
provides
that
if
the
individual
sends
a
letter
to
the
counsel,
they
have
to
deliver
it.
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
a
sheriff
somewhere
grabs
the
letter,
keeps
it,
and
the
counsel
sues
him
under
state
property
law.
and
state
property
law,
they
say,
entitles
me,
says
the
counsel,
to
this
letter.
it's
mine.
it
was
sent
to
me.
now,
if
that
happens
to
be
the
interpretation
of
the
judge
in
the
state
of
x
the
sheriff
can
keep
the
letter,
wouldn't
you
say
that
that
property
law
of
the
state
is
invalid
in
light
of
this
provision
of
the
treaty,
which
is
the
law
of
the
united
states
self
executing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
just
would
like
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i've
given
you
the
straight
facts.
the
straight
facts
are
they
sue...
i
don't
have
to
repeat
them.
i
want
to
know
under...
under
my
straight
facts,
wouldn't
you
say
that...
you
got
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
not
saying
a
treaty.
i'm
saying
there's
a
letter
and
wouldn't
it
be
the
case
that
the
judge
would
have
to
say,
here,
mr.
sheriff,
you
take
the
letter
and
you
hand
it
to
the
counsel?
it's
his
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
what
they're
doing
here
is
they're
saying
we
have
a
cause
of
action.
it's
called
habeas
corpus.
and
we're
asking
for
a
rule
of
decision
in
that
cause
of
action,
and
the
rule
of
decision
in
this
cause
of
action,
just
like
mine,
was
in
property.
is
the
decision...
the
rule
of
decision
is
the
rule
written
into
the
treaty,
just
like
in
the
property
case,
and
you
cannot
do
anything
that
contravenes
it
though,
of
course,
you
can
argue
about
the
content
of
that
rule
of
decision.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
imagine
there's
not...
there's
some
little
authority
both
ways.
to
put
it
in
my
perhaps...
i
know
you
disagree
with
this
way
of
thinking
about
it.
but
i'm...
i'm
thinking
about
this
article
36
and
thinking
that
you're
reading
it
as
if
it
said,
inform
the
individual,
but
if
you
don't,
he
can't
do
anything
about
it.
and
the
other
way
is
to
read
the
silence
as
if
it
said,
inform
the
individual,
but
if
you
don't,
he
can
do
something
about
it.
we're
not
saying
what.
okay.
now,
between
those
two
interpretations,
we
have
the
icj
picking
interpretation
two
and
rejecting
interpretation
one
in,
i
grant
you,
a
different
case.
but
i
guess
since
a
lot
of
these
amicus
briefs
tell
us
throughout
history,
a
long
history,
we've
tried
to
follow
icj
interpretations
of
treaties
to
which
we
are
parties.
why...
it's
all
up
to
us,
but
we've
tried
to.
why...
why
should
we
not,
given
the
two
possible
interpretations...
they
choose
one.
why
should
we
not
choose
to
follow
theirs
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
you're
going
back
to
putting
weight
on
the
absence
of
authority.
in
those
contracting
states,
most
of
which
i
guess
are
civil
system
states,
and
in
civil
systems,
you'll
have
magistrates
who
do
take
this
kind
of
thing
into
account,
but
you
won't
find
a
case
on
it.
so...
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
there
authorities
in
these
other
states
to
the
contrary?
i'm
surprised
if
there
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
they,
in
all
those
property
cases,
you
know,
from
like
the
early
part
of
this
republic
where
property
law
was
determined
in
accordance
with...
you
know
all
those
cases
that
are
cited.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
those
treaties
where
the
courts
then
looked
to
the
treaty
to
help
decide
who
owned
what
property,
they
used
it
as
a
rule
of
decision.
do
those
cases...
treaties
all
use
the
word
individually
enforceable
rights?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
this
term
come
from
as
applied
to
a
rule
of
decision?
i
mean,
when
somebody
is
arguing
that
the
treaty
should
apply
a
rule
of
decision
in
a
case
brought
under
some
other
cause
of
action,
what's
the
best
thing
i
could
read?
i'm
not
an
expert.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
the
way
to
think
about
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the,
quote,
individually
enforceable
rights.
