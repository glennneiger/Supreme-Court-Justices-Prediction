justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
did
you
ask
for
any
remedy
in
this
case
other
than
suppression?
this
arose
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
am
i
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that,
mr....
could
your
client's
attorney
have
argued
in
the
virginia
habeas
proceeding
that
his
procedural
default
should
have
been
excused
because
of
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
default?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
but
i
don't
understand
why...
if
a
jurisdiction
in
this
country
has
a
procedural
default
rule
that
can
be
overcome
by
a
showing
of
cause
and
prejudice
with
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
being
cause,
why
isn't
that
a
remedy
that
is
sufficient
to
give
full
effect
to
the
treaty,
which
is
what
the
treaty
requires?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
is
there
a
difference
between
the
rights
that
could
be
asserted
by
the
consul
or
a
consulate
official
and
the
rights
that
could
be
asserted
by
a
criminal
defendant?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
a
consulate
official
knew
that
a
national
of
that
country
was
being
detained
and
wanted
access
to
that
person
and
that
was
being
denied
by...
by
the
state
officials,
there
would
be
no
remedy
in
federal
court?
the
consulate...
the
foreign
country
could
not
obtain...
could
not
get
federal
enforcement
of
that
right
to
get
access?
