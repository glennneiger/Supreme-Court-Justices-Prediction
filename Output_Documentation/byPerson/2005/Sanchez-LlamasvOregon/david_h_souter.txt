justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that...
that...
my
question
was
going
to
be
are...
are
you
suggesting
or
arguing
that
the
remedy
ought
to
be
exclusion
as
a
matter
of
domestic
law
or
as
a
necessary
implication
of...
of
the
treaty?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
would
you
do
in
a
country
that
does
not
apply
an
exclusion
remedy
in...
in
domestic
cases
given
the
provision,
which
i
can't
quote
correctly,
but
you'll
know
what
it
is,
the...
the
provision
that
the
treaty
will...
will
be
administered
in
accordance
with
or
consistently
with,
i
guess
it
is,
domestic
law
so
long
as
full
effect
is
given
to
its
substantive
provisions?
i
would
have
thought
that
that...
that
that
provision
for
administration
in
accordance
with
domestic
law
would
have
a
great
bearing,
if...
if
not
being
dispositive,
on
the
remedy,
so
that
if
i
were
answering
the
question
i...
i
had
asked
you,
i...
i
would
have
said,
well,
it's
probably
a
domestic
law
basis
for...
for
exclusion,
but
not
a
treaty
basis.
so
why
in
those
countries...
getting
back
to...
to
my...
why...
why
in
those
countries
that
do
not
customarily
apply
an
exclusion
remedy
wouldn't
it
be
consistent
with
the
treaty
for
them
to
decline
to
apply
it
given
the
provision
for
administration
consistently
with...
with
domestic
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
the
treaty--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the...
the
treaty
provision
then
governs
only
in
the
sense
that
for
remedy
it
refers
you
to
domestic
law.
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
keep
doing
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's...
it's
a
duty
to
advise
him
of...
of
his
right
to
have
them
notify
the...
the
consulate.
it
is
not
a
duty
to
remain
silent
until
the
consulate
responds.
and
even
if
you
are
correct
that
the
obligation
to...
to
advise
him
and
to
give
the
notice
arises
immediately
upon
the
realization
that
he's
a
foreign
national,
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
treaty
that
requires
them
to
defer
interrogation
until
the...
the
consulate
has
decided
whether
it
wants
to
do
anything
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you...
do
you
say,
going
back
to...
to
the
point
justice
ginsburg
made,
if
the
united
states
follows
a
48
to
72-hour
rule,
is...
is
that
a
violation
of
the
treaty?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we...
we
might
have
to
make
it
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't...
isn't
the
problem
with
your
analogy
that
counsel
do
not
advise
their
clients
about
brady
rights
because,
by
definition
or
in
the
normal
case
by
definition,
counsel
doesn't
know
whether
there's
a
brady
violation.
but
counsel
does
know
or,
it
seems
to
me,
can
properly
be
charged
with
knowing
that
when
he's
representing
a
foreign
national,
the
foreign
national
has
a
vienna
convention
right,
just
as
much
as
the
foreign
national
has
a
miranda
right,
and
he
can
advise
him
of
that.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
brady
analogy
is...
is
not
apt.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
once,
at
least--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the...
the
only
thing
in...
in
the
second
part
of
justice
breyer's
question,
the
only
thing
that
the
lawyer
has
to
be
relied
upon
is
to
get
the
issue
raised
at
the
appropriate
point
in
the
trial
process.
and...
and
so,
at
the
very
least,
what
virginia
is...
is
arguing
here
is
that
he
waived
it
because
no
objection
was
raised
based
upon
a
prior
vienna
convention
failure.
that
is
a
very
conventional
obligation
upon
lawyers.
it...
it's
an
obligation
that
goes
to
miranda.
it's
an
obligation
that
goes
to
any
denial
of
rights
of
which
counsel
could
or
should
be
charged
with
knowing,
and
i
don't
see
why
there
should
be
an
exception
made
to...
to
that
obligation
to
raise
the
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
and
i'm
not...
i'm
not
suggesting
anything
that...
that
affects
that.
yes,
the
state
does
have
to
notify
him,
and
if
he
wants,
the
state
has
to
make
the
phone
call.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
lawyer
should
be
taxed
with
knowing
that
that
is
the
individual's
right.
the
lawyer
should
be
taxed
with
knowing
that
because
it's
the
law
of
the
land.
it's
a
treaty.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
the
obligation
is
upon
the
lawyer
to
say,
well,
did
they...
did
they
tell
you,
did
they
notify
the
consul,
just
as
the
lawyer
would
say,
did
you
get
the
miranda
warnings.
and...
and
if
the
lawyer
does
not
make
that
inquiry
and
does
not
raise
an
objection,
whatever
it
may
be,
if
in
fact
the
individual
didn't
get
his
rights,
then
i
don't
see
why
there
should
be...
there
should
not
be
a
waiver
with
respect
to
the
vienna
convention
objection,
just
as
there
is
a
waiver
with
respect
to
a
miranda
objection
or
a
search
and
seizure
objection
and...
and
other
constitutional
rights.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
after
the
first
ineffective
assistance
claim
is
decided
in
the
client's
favor,
people
are
going
to
wake
up.
i
mean,
you
have
to
admit
at
this
stage
of
the
game...
and
it's
not
your
client's
fault,
but
the...
this
is
a
fairly
rare
bird.
and...
and
if,
in
fact,
it
were
held
to
be...
let's...
let's
assume
that...
that
on...
on
collateral
review,
someone
in
your
client's
position
made
the
following
claim.
number
one,
the
state
didn't
tell
me.
they...
they
failed
in
their
vienna
convention
right.
number
two,
my
lawyer
never
inquired
of
me
or
of
anybody
else
whether
the
state
had
given
me
my...
my
vienna
convention
rights.
and
therefore,
my...
my
lawyer
was
ineffective.
if
on
collateral
review
a
claim
like
that
is
made,
it
is
accepted
and
prejudice
is
found,
i
would
imagine
the
bar
is
going
to
wake
up
fairly
fast
to
what's
going
on.
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
one
factual
question?
and
i...
i
should
know
this.
i
just...
if...
if
i
did
know
it,
i
can't
remember
it
now.
was
any
ineffective
assistance
claim
raised...
i...
i
take
it
there's
no
ineffective
assistance
claim
that
was
ever
raised
on
collateral
review
here
because
you've
never
gotten
to
a
collateral
review
stage.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that...
wasn't...
i'm...
i'm
sorry?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
did
that
on
collateral
review
as
opposed
to
trying
to
supplement
the
direct
appeal?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
all
you've
got
to
do
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
ask
him
what
his
name
is.
why
don't
you
ask
him
whether
he's
an
american
citizen?
if
he
says
no,
say
what
country
are
you
a
citizen
of.
i
mean,
i...
i
don't
see
the
difficulty
of
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
i
mean,
why
does
it
have
to
be
a
distant
goal?
i
mean,
it
seems
easy.
justice
david
h.
souter
does...
does...
would
virginia
allow
the...
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
to
be
raised
on
collateral
review
for
failure
of
counsel
to...
to
advise
the
client
or
take
action
on
the
client's
behalf
under
the
virginia
convention...
the
vienna
convention
during...
during
the...
the
direct
proceedings?
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say
they...
they
contemplate
it,
how
do
they
express
that
contemplation?
i
mean,
are...
are
there
magic
words
that
diplomats
understand
or...
or
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they...
they
provide
expressly
that
these
are
rights
that
may
be
asserted
individually
in
national
courts?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they...
they
go
beyond
the
reference
to
rights
as...
as
in
article
36.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i
would
agree
there,
but
we're
not...
this...
this
isn't
a
case
about
subjecting
them
to
suit.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but...
but
that
is...
that's
not
equivalent
to
saying
that
it's...
it
is
subjecting
the
united
states
to
suit.
