ms.
mary
h.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
counsel
describes
the
rule
that
he
asks
this
court
to
announce
under
article
36
as
revolutionary,
and
i
think
that's
accurate.
it
would
be
revolutionary
for
this
court
to
construe
the
article
36
of
the
vienna
convention
to
grant
an
individual
foreign
national
a
right
to
obtain
a
judicially
created
sanction
against
the
state
for
its
failure
to
provide
the
information
that
it
is
obliged
to...
to
provide
under
article
36.
no
other
signatory's
court
has
construed
the
treaty
to
permit
an
individual
in
a
criminal
proceeding
to
raise
the
kind
of
challenge
that
petitioner
seeks
to
raise
here,
and
certainly
no
other
court
has
suggested
that
exclusion
of
lawfully
obtained
evidence
would
be
the
appropriate
remedy
for
that
violation.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
there
have
been
only
a
handful
of
courts
that
have
dealt
with
the
issue.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
the...
a
canadian
court
has
said
that
the...
that
there
is
no...
no
remedy
for...
in
a
criminal
proceeding
for
that
sort
of
remedy.
and
there
are,
in
fact--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--it
is
a
holding.
it's
a
lower
court
opinion.
it's
not
the--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--i
think
that's
absolutely
fair,
and
what's--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--i
think,
though,
it
is--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--yes,
that
is
fair,
but
i
think
it--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--yes.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
if
it
had
said
that--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--i
would
agree
with
you.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
i
think
the
starting
point
is
with
the
text
and
context
of
the
treaty,
and
beginning
with
the
preamble
that
makes
it
very
clear
that
this
treaty,
like
other
international
treaties,
is
an
international
agreement
concerned
with
the
obligations
of
the
signatories,
not
with
any
particular
granting
of
rights
for
the
individuals
who
may
benefit
from
those
obligations.
and
one
thing
that
the
preamble
makes
very
clear
is
that
matters
not
expressly
regulated
by
the
provisions
of
this
treaty
are
left
to
the
rules
of
customary
international
law.
the
only
remedy
that
is
discussed
as
part
of
the...
the
treaty
negotiation
is
the
optional
protocol
that
would
permit
signatories,
not
individuals,
to
take
a
dispute
under
the
treaty
to
the
international
court
of
justice.
so
there
is
little
evidence
in
the
context
of
the
treaty
and
there
is
evidence
contrary--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--your
honor,
even
following
the
icj
opinion
in
avena
does
not
get
petitioner
the
relief
that
he
seeks
in
this
court
or
that
he
sought
below.
it
does
not
get
you
to
suppression
of
the
statements
that
were
made.
it's...
it's...
there
are
a
couple
of
very
important
things
to
consider
in
the
avena
decision
from
the
icj.
they
discuss
suppression
and
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
they
specifically
reject
mexico's
assertion
that
there's
a
connection
somehow
between
the
provision
of
information
and...
under
the
article
36
and
the
ongoing
criminal
interrogation.
so...
and
they
also
discuss
the...
the
concept
of
without
delay
and
what
that
meant
to...
to
those
who
put
together
the
treaty.
and
it
does
not
mean
immediately.
so
there...
under
the
icj's
reading
of
the
treaty,
there
would
not
be
a
basis
to
suppress
the
statements
that
petitioner
seeks
to
suppress
in
our
court.
i
think--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--there...
there
was
not,
your
honor.
the
only
remedy
that
petitioner
has
sought
in
this
case
is
suppression
of
the
statements.
and
it's
also
important,
i
think,
to
make
the
distinction
between
the
oregon
case
and
the
virginia
case.
in
the
oregon
case,
it's
clear
that
counsel
for
petitioner
knew
about
the
obligations
under
article
36
and
raised
them
in
the
motion
to
suppress.
and
so
there's
no
question
about
the
state's
obligation
to...
to
inform
the
consul
that
the...
that
petitioner
was
being
detained
or
any
concern
with
interference
with
consular
access
and
communication.
the
only
violation
that
we
have
in
the
case
is
that
the
state
failed
to
provide
the
information
that
it
was
obligated
to
provide
under
article
36.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
i
think
that
would
be
one
way
to
ensure
better
compliance
with
our
obligations
under
the
treaty.
the
treaty
requires
competent
authorities
to
provide
the
information
and
doesn't
specify
exactly
who
is
included
and
who
is
not
included
in
that
category.
oregon
and
other
states,
along
with--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--i...
i
was
hearing
the
question,
i
guess,
of
whether
that
would
be
something
that
judges
could
do,
and
i...
and
i
was
responding
to...
to
that
part
of
it.
i
don't
think
that...
that
judges
are
obligated
to
provide
that
as
a
requirement
of
the
treaty.
i
think
it
does
fall
on
the
state
authorities
to
provide
that
information.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
this--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--we
have
done
a
number
of
things.
in
2000,
the
attorney
general
put
together
a
task
force
that
included
consular
officials,
law
enforcement
officials,
jail
managers
and,
working
together,
devised
some
better
education
tools
so
that...
that
there
could
be
more
education
in
terms
of
the...
the
competent
authorities
who
need
to
provide
this
information.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
the
state
department
has
recommended
that
as
soon
as
it
is
known
that
the
individual
is
a
foreign
national,
that
the
information
be
given.
i
think
that
it
is
not--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--we've
actually
worked
with
our
jail
managers
to
develop
a
form
that
could
be
used
as
part
of
the
booking
process
to
provide
the
information.
and
the...
i
mean,
i
think
the
more
we
do
the
education,
probably
the
better
the
compliance
will
be.
but
what's
important
is
that
we're
attempting
to
do
that
not
because
the
treaty
obligates
that
sort
of
immediate
notification
at
the
risk
of
not
being
able
to
use
evidence
obtained
in
a
later
criminal
proceeding.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
it
says
without
delay
that
the
information
should
be
provided,
but
that
phrase,
without
delay,
when
you
look
at
the
prefatory
materials
and
how
the
icj
has
construed
it,
doesn't
mean
immediately.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
and
the
way
the
icj
has
construed
that,
after
reviewing
the
materials,
is
that
the
phrase,
without
delay,
means
the
same
thing
in
the
three
places
that
it's
used
in
the
treaty.
and
so
there
is...
it's
not
an
immediate
requirement.
there
is
some
time
that
can
pass,
and
in
some
countries,
there
may
be
considerable
time.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
it
is
not
required
under
the
treaty
that
the
advice
be
given
prior
to
interrogation.
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
at
some
point
in
a
prolonged
interrogation,
that
right
is...
that
obligation
will
arise.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
well,
and
part
of
the
difficulty
is
it's
not
so
easy
to
give
simply
a
simple
advice
because
it's
not
always
clear
that
someone
is
a
foreign
national,
and
even
if
there's
a
suggestion
that
someone
might
be--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--the
other
difficulty
is
that
for
some
foreign
nationals,
this
is
not...
this
is
not
the
case
where
the
detainee
controls
the
contact
with
consular
officials.
we
have
mandatory
notification
obligations.
so
it's
important
to
establish
what
country
the
individual
is
from,
and
some
individuals
would
prefer
that
the
officials
not
know
what
country
they
are
from.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
and
certainly
we're
hoping
to
move
toward
better
compliance
by
moving
toward
that
goal.
but
the
question
in
this
case--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--and
i
think
it
gets
easier
as
more
cases
like
this
one
certainly
get
the
message
out.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
but
the
question
is
when
there
is
a
violation
and...
and
if
it's
from
lack
of
education
or
lack
of
effort
on
the
state's
part
to
ensure
that
people
understand
the
obligation,
then
does
the
treaty
give
the
individual
the
right
in
a
criminal
proceeding
to
have
that
lawfully
obtained
evidence
kept
out
of
the
proceeding.
and
so
certainly
we
can
make
better
efforts
to
improve
compliance
with
what
is
an
obligation
that
we
have
under
the
treaty,
but
that
doesn't
take
this
court
to
suppressing
the
evidence
in
the
criminal
proceeding,
and
that's
what
petitioner
has
sought
from
the
court.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
i
think
the
question
would
come
down
to
whether
the
judge
falls
in
the
category
of
competent
authorities
under
the
treaty,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
that
would
be
construed,
whether
it
would
be
construed
to
include
the
judge
or
if
it's
primarily
focused
on
the...
the
state
government
officials
who
would
be
involved
in
the...
the
criminal
proceeding.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
thank
you.
