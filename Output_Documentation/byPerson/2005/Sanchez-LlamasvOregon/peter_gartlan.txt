mr.
peter
gartlan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
presents
three
questions.
the
first
is
does
article
36
of
the
vienna
convention
on
consular
relations
confer
rights
to
individuals
such
as
mr.
sanchez
llamas.
the
second
is
can
mr.
sanchez
llamas
enforce
the
right
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution.
and
the
third
is
can
the
right
be
enforced
by
suppression.
the
first
issue
is...
is
a
matter
of
treaty
interpretation,
and
the
language
of
the
article
36
is...
is
plain.
it
confers
three
rights.
article
36(1)
says
that
the
consulate
and
the
individual
can
have
free
communication
between
them.
article
36(1)(b)
gives
to
the
detainee,
the
foreign
national
detainee,
the
right
to
have
his
consulate
notified
of
his
arrest
and
the
right
to
forward
communication
to
the
consulate.
and
it
also
imposes
a
duty
on
the
detaining
authorities
to
inform
the
foreign
national
under...
of
his
rights
under
that
section.
and
it's
critical,
or
at
least
important,
and
telling
to...
to
notice
that
the
detainee
gets
to
control
the
communication.
the
detainee
initiates
and
controls
the
communication
with
the
consulate.
it's
not
the
consulate
contacting
the
detainee
initially.
it's
the
detainee
authorizes
the
contact.
the
secondary
sources...
we...
we
believe
the
text
is
plain,
but
if
the
court
resorts
to
any
secondary
sources,
that
too
will
confirm
the
plain
language
of...
of
the
article.
mr.
peter
gartlan
well,
your
honor,
actually
the
article
36
is...
is
unique
and
different
in
that
the
revolutionary
part
of
this
is
that
the
detainee
did,
for
the
first
time,
have
the
authority
to
have
the
consulate
notified.
typically
most
of
the
notification
statutes,
bilateral
treaties,
multilateral
treaties
require
mandatory
notification,
but
this
is
an
instance
where
the
detainee
gets
to
control.
the
detainee
decides
whether
or
not
the
consulate
is
going
to
be
contacted.
mr.
peter
gartlan
well,
it...
it
could
work
on
the
international
level
as
well.
you
know,
a
state
could
complain
to
another
state,
but
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
this
article,
as
domestic
law
in
the
united
states,
confers
a
personal
right
to
a
foreign
national
detainee
because
a
treaty
in
the
united
states,
a
self
executing
treaty...
and
everybody
agrees
this
is
that...
works
in
two
spheres,
on
two
levels.
one
level
is
the
international
level,
but
by...
through
the
supremacy
clause,
the
treaty
is
also
domestic
law.
and
the
question
is
whether
as
domestic
law
this
treaty
confers
personal
rights
to
individuals
because--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
in
two
cases,
the
icj
has
held
that
this
article
36
does
confer
rights
to
individuals.
there's
the
lagrand
case--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gartlan
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gartlan
at
least
two,
your
honor,
lagrand
and
avena,
and
both
involved
criminal
cases.
mr.
peter
gartlan
many
of
the
treaty
partners
view
it
as
conferring
a
right,
at
least
11
tell
an
arrestee
of
his
rights
under...
under
the
treaty
and--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--that's
beginning
to
happen,
your
honor.
in
australia
and
great
britain,
there...
i
believe
it
has
been--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
gartlan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gartlan
yes,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--in
1969?
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gartlan
that...
that...
excuse
me.
that's
when
the
united
states
ratified
the
treaty,
1969.
mr.
peter
gartlan
typically
i
think
the--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--typically
it
is
a
matter
of
state
to
state
complaints
or
apologies
and--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gartlan
offhand...
i
believe
it's
within
the
last
couple
years.
mr.
peter
gartlan
no,
it's
not
automatic.
typically
in
the
commonwealth
countries,
a
judge
has
a
lot
of
equitable
authority
to
kind
of
balance
some
interests
and
decide
whether
or
not
to
exclude
the...
the
evidence.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
happened
worldwide,
that
it's
pervasive
practice,
but
in...
in
some
sense,
what
other
countries
are
doing
in
their
individual
systems,
it's
nice
to
know
that
it's
not
all
that
controlling
because
the
question,
again,
is
how
does
this
statute
work
as
domestic
law.
mr.
peter
gartlan
it's
a
necessary
implication
or
it's
an
implication
of
the
treaty,
of
section
2
of
article
36.
but--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--it
could
be
appropriate.
the
treaty
was
prepared...
drafted
full
knowing
that
there
are
various
and
myriad
kinds
of
legal
systems
throughout
the
world,
and
it
wasn't
intended
to
say,
here's
the...
here's
the
remedy
because
typically
under
international
law,
the
remedy
is...
is
a
domestic
remedy.
and
this...
this
doesn't...
the
treaty
does
not
say,
thou
shalt
suppress.
mr.
peter
gartlan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gartlan
through
the
supremacy
clause,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gartlan
well,
the
treaty
doesn't
in...
in
its
text
doesn't
say,
thou
shalt
suppress,
but
is...
it
is
a
source
of
authority
because
the
treaty
says
thou
shalt
give
full
effect
to
the
law.
mr.
peter
gartlan
in...
in
many
cases,
yes,
your
honor.
again,
the...
the
drafters
recognized
that
remedies
would
be
local,
and
so
the
question
is
for
our
system,
for
the
united
states
system,
how
does
the
united
states
system...
how
does
it
remedy
breaches.
and
it
depends
upon
the
type
of
the
breach.
in
this
instance,
the
breach
here
involved
statements,
and
so
the
breach
occurred
when
the
authorities
did
not
inform
mr.
sanchez
llamas
of
his
right
to
contact
the
consulate.
mr.
peter
gartlan
yes,
your
honor.
well,
it's
kind
of
a
combination
of
both.
the
treaty
directs
give
effect
to
these
rights.
and
we
are
asking
the
court
to
exercise
its
authority
to
remedy
the
breach
because
suppression
is
a
creature
of
this
court's
authority,
common
law
authority.
mr.
peter
gartlan
yes,
your
honor,
and
then
supply
whatever
remedy
would
be
appropriate.
and
again,
that...
that's
a
call
upon
the
judiciary
to
remedy
treaty
violations,
and...
and
that's
been--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--no,
your
honor,
because
again,
remedies
are
a
question
of
domestic
law,
so
it's
up
to
the
domestic
courts
to
decide
what
would
be
the
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
peter
gartlan
correct,
your
honor.
no
other
remedy
but...
but
suppression.
mr.
peter
gartlan
yes,
your
honor,
and
many
courts
have
held
that...
well,
the
miranda
rights
pretty
much
encompasses
these
rights,
but
they're
different.
these
are
standalone
rights,
and
what's
critical
about
this,
what's
really
important
is
that
for
every
united
states
citizen
who's
arrested...
and
typically
interrogation
is
going
to
follow
quickly
on
the
heels
of
the
arrest...
they're
giving
the
miranda
warnings.
and
essentially
they
have
three
options.
they
can
speak
to
the
police.
they
can
invoke
the
right
to
silence,
or
they
can
invoke
the
right
to
an
attorney.
however,
foreign
nationals
have
a
fourth
option
and
that
fourth
option
is
they
can
have
the
consulate
contacted,
if
they
want.
and
the
consulate
provides
different
kinds
of
information
and
support
for
the
arrestee.
and
it's...
what's
critical
is...
what's
hard
to
see
is
that
because
we're
in
this
country,
we
don't
see
it,
but
if
you're
overseas
and
you've
been
arrested...
let's
say
you're
in
damascus
and
you're
given
a
dime
and
your
options
are
to
call
the
local
attorney
provided
by
your
jailers
or
the
american
consulate.
and
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
most
people
are
going
to
call
the
american
consulate.
why?
it's
because
there's
a
kind
of
a
familiarity.
there's
an
attraction
there.
there's
an
appeal.
there's
security.
you're
dealing
with
the
known.
whereas,
a
local
attorney,
it's
the
unknown,
and
it's
by
the
local
authorities.
mr.
peter
gartlan
well,
you
know,
your
honor,
it's
not
really
the
content
of
the
advice.
the
question
is
at
this
point
what
would
people
do,
and
the
legal
error
here,
what's
wrong,
is
that
the
foreign
national
is
given
the
same
three
options,
but
by
law,
he's
supposed
to
have
a
fourth
option.
mr.
peter
gartlan
well,
but
really
he
hasn't
been
given
an
attorney
yet,
your
honor.
we
have
to
remember
this
is
the
arrest
has
been
made
and
he's
confronted
with
options.
mr.
peter
gartlan
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gartlan
no.
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
if
you're
arrested,
the
next...
you
have
a
choice,
and
you
have
one
of
three
if
you
are
a
national,
but
if
you're
a
foreigner,
you
have
one
of
four.
and
the
question--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--but
this
contemplates
that
the
detaining
authorities
informed
the
person
of...
of
what
their
rights
are
to
contact
the
consulate.
mr.
peter
gartlan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gartlan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gartlan
your
honor,
i'd...
i'd
like
to...
to
move
back
the
discussion
to
there's
no
attorney
yet,
and
the
question
is
what
can
that
person
do.
and...
and
the
error--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--your
honor,
it
needn't--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--yes.
it
depends
on
the
legal
injury
that
flows
from
the
violation.
now,
in
this
instance,
we're
dealing
with
statements
because
again,
to
illustrate
perhaps,
even
a
national,
given
these
three
options...
what
if
the
police
forgot
to
tell
the...
the
person
that
he
has
a
right
to
an
attorney?
now,
he's
given
these
two
options,
and
he...
he
waives
those.
and
that
waiver
is
voluntary,
but
it's
still
invalid
as
a
matter
of
law
because
he
wasn't
given
all
the
options
he's
supposed
to
be
given.
and
that's
the
difference
because
we
don't
know
what
would
have...
typically
you
don't
know
what
would
have
happened
if
somebody
were
given
all
the
options.
that's...
that's
a
problem.
so
now--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--well,
actually
the
language
of
the
article
says
without
delay,
your
honor,
so
that
suggests
that
there's
some
kind
of
promptness
that's...
that's
involved.
mr.
peter
gartlan
and
our
reading
of
the
article
is
that
once
the...
the
police
know
or
have
grounds
to
believe
that
the...
that
the
person
is
probably
a
foreign
national,
then
that
duty
arises
on
the
police
to
give
him
his
rights.
mr.
peter
gartlan
yes,
your
honor,
but
in...
in
this
case,
the...
the
statements
that
we're
seeking
to
suppress,
the
harmful
ones,
occurred
about
8
hours
after
the
initial
arrest.
however--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--yes,
your
honor,
because
our
position
is
that
once
somebody
says,
yes,
i...
i
want
to
speak
with
the
consulate,
it's
like
saying
i
want
to
speak
with
my
attorney
or
i
want
to
invoke
my
right
to
silence.
it's
a
signal
that
this
person
believes
that
they
are
being
overwhelmed
by
the
situation,
that
they
are
no
longer
in
control,
and
they're
trying
to
exercise
some
control.
now,
this
court
doesn't
have
to
make
this
ruling
in
this
case,
but
our
position
would
be
if
somebody
invoked--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--well,
our...
our
position
is
that
if
there's
an
indication
of
a
right
to
have
the
consulate
contacted,
that's
like
a
cry
for
help.
it's
like...
it's
an
alternative
way
of
saying
i
want...
i
can't
deal
with
this
anymore.
i'm...
i'd
like
my
right
to
silence.
and--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--that
would
be
a
problem
for
that
country
and
people
in
that
country.
but
now
we're
dealing
with--
mr.
peter
gartlan
--the
treaty
is
supposed
to
be
applied
in
every
country,
and
there
are
going
to
be
different
results.
the
drafters
recognized
some...
some
countries
have
different
systems,
different
waiting
periods
before
there's
interrogation
or
before
there's
contact.
and
all
this
treaty
does
is
it
puts
the
foreign
national
on
par
with
an
american,
with
the
united
states
citizen.
that
all
intends
to
do.
mr.
peter
gartlan
thank
you,
your
honor.
