chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
two
cases,
sanchez
llamas
v.
oregon
and
bustillo
v.
johnson.
mr.
gartlan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
that
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
those
references
in
the
secondary
sources
and
in
the
document
itself
are
meant
to
make
clear
that
if
the
individual
detainee
does
not
want
contact
with
his
consular
officials,
for
example,
in
a
case
where
he
might
be
seeking
asylum
or
something
like
that,
that
it
was,
as
you
said
earlier,
his
decision
and
not
necessarily
that
there
was
to
be
a
departure
from
the
norm
in
international...
the
international
context
where
treaties
are
between
the
sovereigns
and
don't
confer
enforceable
rights
on
individuals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
so
the...
that's
what
the
different
countries,
the
signatories,
are
supposed
to
provide,
and
if
they
don't,
that's
a
matter
to
be
taken
up
bilaterally
between
the
countries
involved
and
not
necessarily
an
individual
enforceable
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
do
any
of
our
treaty
partners
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
to
violations
of
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
didn't
even
have
it
then,
did
we?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
when
the
convention
came
into
effect?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it
doesn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--why
don't
you
go
ahead?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so...
so
if
the
treaty
doesn't
say
suppress,
what
authority
does
a
federal
court
have
to
direct
a
state
court
to
exclude
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
supremacy
clause
gives
effect
to
the
treaty.
you
just
told
me
the
treaty
doesn't
require
suppression.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gartlan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
stancil.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
miranda
gives
you
the
same,
you
know,
right
to...
to
reach
a
counsel,
a
right
to
remain
silent,
and
yet,
if
your
lawyer
doesn't
raise
a
miranda
violation
in
trial,
it
can
be
waived.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
should
this
be
elevated
to
a
special
status
beyond
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
true
about
the
right
to
remain
silent
or
any
other
rights
that
are
very
much
the
rights
of
the
defendant,
not
the
rights
of
the
counsel,
but
they're
exercised
in
consultation
with
the
counsel,
and
if
they
make
a
determination
not
to
contact
the
consul,
then
that's
a
decision
that
counsel
made,
and
if
it's
ineffective,
there
are
remedies
for
that.
i'm
not
sure
how
it's
different
than
the
right
to
remain
silent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stancil.
ms.
williams.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
state...
you
don't
have
any
problem
with
state
judges
being
enlisted
as
officers
to
execute
federal
treaty
obligations
on
behalf
of
the
state
department
or
someone?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
he
doesn't
have
to
answer
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
williams.
mr.
thro.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
was
a
state
collateral
review?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is...
is
a
defense
counsel
a
competent
authority
under
the
treaty
for
the
purposes
of
notifying
the
accused?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
that's
kind
of
a
tough
position
to
put
the
lawyer
in.
if
he's
not
a
competent
authority
for
notification
purposes
and
he
makes
the
judgment
that,
you
know,
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
do
any
good
to
notify
the
consulate,
wouldn't
he
be
better
advised
not
to
tell
his
client
about
it?
because
if
he
does,
then
it's,
i
guess,
harmless
error
that
the
state
hasn't
notified
him,
and
if
he
doesn't,
it's
kind
of
an
ace
in
the
hole.
you
see
how
the
trial
goes,
and
at
the
end
say,
by
the
way,
the
state
never
notified
my
client.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
like
a
speedy
trial
claim.
right?
i
mean,
if
the
lawyer
knows
he
has
a
right
to
a
trial
within
a
certain
number
of
days,
and
he
doesn't...
it's
not
his
obligation
to
notify
the
state.
he
just
kind
of
watches
the
clock
and
lets
the
clock
run
out,
and
then
he
has
a
claim
based
on
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
thro.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
there
any
countries
that
recognize
individually
enforceable
rights
under
this
convention
overseas
on
behalf
of
american
citizens?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
they
don't...
if
they
can't
ask
him...
i
mean,
i
assume
many
foreign
nationals
are
detained
fairly
close
to
the
border,
and
if
you
start
saying,
well,
my
first
question
is,
are
you
a
citizen
or
not,
you've
got
to
give
miranda
warnings
first
saying
you
don't
have
to
answer
any
question
that
might
incriminate
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
a
catch
22.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stancil,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
refers
to
his
rights,
to
make
it
clear
that
the
consular
office
does
not
have
the
right
to
contact
him
in
the
situations
where
he
would
prefer
not
to
be
contacted
by
his
consul.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
1983
is
a
good
example.
if
you
have
a...
a
treaty
between
a
state
and
the
federal
government,
a
spending
clause
provision,
that
says
you've
got
to
spend
the
money
this
way,
give
certain
rights
to
the
individuals,
we
don't
always
automatically
hold
that
the
individuals
have
enforceable
rights
even
under
1983.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
said
his
rights
in
gonzaga
v.
doe,
which
dealt
with
the
student
privacy
rights
act,
and
we
held...
and
the...
we...
the
court
held
that
that
was...
did
not
give
rise
to
individually
enforceable
rights.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stancil.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinions
in
04-10566,
sanchez-llamas
versus
oregon,
and
05-51,
bustillo
versus
johnson.
these
cases
concern
the
application
of
a
particular
provision
in
an
international
treaty,
namely,
article
36
of
the
vienna
convention
on
consular
relations.
under
article
36,
when
a
national
of
one
country
is
detained
by
authorities
in
another
country,
those
authorities
must
notify
the
detainee’s
consular
officers
if
the
detainee
so
requests.
in
addition,
article
36
requires
authorities
to
inform
a
foreign
national
they
detain
that
he
is
entitled
to
request
consular
notification.
the
convention
states
that
article
36
rights,
“shall
be
exercised
in
conformity
with
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
receiving
state”
--
that
is,
the
place
where
the
foreign
national
is
detained
--
“subject
to
the
proviso,
however,
that
the
said
laws
and
regulations
must
enable
full
effect
to
be
given
for
the
purposes
for
which
the
rights
accorded
under
this
article
are
intended.”
these
cases
concern
how
to
apply
article
36
in
the
context
of
two
separate
criminal
proceedings.
the
first
involves
a
mexican
national
named
moises
sanchez-llamas.
in
december
1999,
sanchez-llamas
was
arrested
in
oregon
after
an
exchange
of
gunfire
with
police.
the
police
gave
him
miranda
warnings
in
both
english
and
spanish,
but
never
told
him
that
he
could
ask
to
have
the
mexican
consulate
informed
of
his
detention.
sanchez-llamas
was
then
questioned
by
police,
made
several
incriminating
statements
and
was
charged
with
attempted
murder
and
other
crimes.
before
trial,
he
asked
the
court
to
exclude
his
statements
to
the
police
on
the
ground
that
the
police
had
failed
to
comply
with
article
36
of
the
vienna
convention.
the
trial
court
denied
the
request,
sanchez-llamas
was
convicted,
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
oregon
state
courts.
the
question
is
whether
the
failure
to
comply
with
article
36
requires
the
suppression
of
the
statements
to
the
police.
we
conclude
that
it
does
not
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
convention
itself
says
nothing
about
suppression;
and
it
would
be
strange
if
it
did,
since
no
other
country
applies
a
rule
like
the
automatic
exclusionary
rule
applied
in
our
courts.
sanchez-llamas
cannot
point
to
a
single
country
in
the
world
that
has
signed
the
convention
that
offers
the
remedy
he
says
the
united
states
must
provide
for
article
36
violations.
sanchez-llamas
nevertheless
argues
that
because
the
purposes
of
article
36
must
be
given
“full
effect”
in
the
words
of
the
treaty,
an
article
36
violation
requires
some
judicial
remedy,
and
under
american,
law,
he
argues,
that
remedy
is
suppression.
we
disagree.
the
exclusionary
rule,
suppression,
is
not
a
remedy
that
we
apply
lightly.
because
the
rule
imposes
considerable
social
costs,
it
should
be
applied
only
where
its
remedial
purposes
are
directly
advanced.
we
have
normally
applied
the
exclusionary
rule
only
for
constitutional
violations.
we
have
ruled,
for
example,
that
the
constitution
requires
the
exclusion
of
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
guarantee
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
requires
the
exclusion
of
confessions
exacted
in
violation
of
due
process.
in
contrast,
the
consular-notification
right
sanchez-llamas
asserts
is
at
best
remotely
connected
to
the
gathering
of
evidence.
article
36
says
nothing
about
searches
or
seizures
or
interrogations.
indeed,
article
36
does
not
guarantee
defendants
any
assistance
at
all.
the
provision
secures
only
a
right
of
foreign
nationals
to
have
their
consulate
informed
of
their
arrest
or
detention.
it
does
not
provide
a
right
to
have
the
consulate
intervene
or
to
have
law-enforcement
authorities
cease
their
investigation
pending
notice
or
intervention.
moreover,
the
purposes
generally
served
by
suppressing
evidence
are
not
implicated
here.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
a
confession
is
less
reliable
because
police
did
not
comply
with
article
36,
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
think
police
gain
an
advantage
in
gathering
evidence
by
ignoring
article
36.
at
the
same
time,
the
interests
sanchez-llamas
says
article
36
serves
are
effectively
protected
by
other
rights.
foreign
nationals
arrested
for
a
crime,
like
anyone
else
in
our
country,
are
entitled
to
the
panoply
of
miranda
rights.
given
the
protections
afforded
by
these
rights,
we
think
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
for
article
36
violations
is
unnecessary.
the
second
case
involves
a
honduran
national,
mario
bustillo.
in
1997,
bustillo
was
arrested
and
charged
with
murdering
a
man
in
springfield,
virginia.
while
in
custody,
bustillo
was
never
told
that
he
could
ask
to
have
the
honduran
consulate
notified
of
his
detention.
he
was
convicted
first-degree
murder,
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed
on
direct
appeal.
he
then
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
state
court.
there,
he
argued
for
the
first
time
that
authorities
had
violated
article
36
of
the
vienna
convention.
bustillo
claimed
that
if
the
honduran
consulate
had
been
notified
of
his
detention,
the
consulate
would
have
helped
him
in
his
defense
of
trial.
virginia
courts
dismissed
bustillo’s
claim,
because
he
had
failed
to
raise
the
issue
during
his
trial
or
on
appeal.
virginia
courts,
like
federal
courts,
apply
a
rule
of
procedural
default.
under
this
rule,
defendants
are
barred
from
raising
claims
in
post-conviction
proceedings
that
they
could
have
raised
at
trial.
the
question
in
bustillo’s
case
is
whether
article
36
claims
may
be
subjected
to
these
rules
of
procedural
default
or
have
to
be
treated
differently.
now,
we
addressed
this
issue
in
a
previous
case,
known
as
breard
against
greene.
there,
we
confronted
a
federal
habeas
petitioner
who
presented
an
article
36
claim
that
he
had
failed
to
raise
in
state
court.
we
held
that
the
requirement
in
the
treaty
that
article
36
be
given,
“full
effect”,
does
not
excuse
the
failure;
it
does
not
trump
the
normal
application
of
the
procedural
default
rule.
we
explained
that
the
usual
rule
is
that
treaties
are
implemented
through
the
procedural
rules
of
domestic
law
and
that
the
language
of
the
convention
itself
makes
clear
that
it
is
to
be
implemented
using
domestic
procedures.
our
domestic
procedures
include
rules
of
procedural
default.
but
bustillo
argues
that
we
should
reconsider
our
decision
in
breard
in
light
of
two
intervening
decisions
by
the
international
court
of
justice,
or
the
icj.
those
decisions
interpreted
the
convention
and
held
that
in
some
circumstances
it
prohibits
the
application
of
procedural-default
rules
to
bar
article
36
claims.
we
are
not
bound
by
the
icj’s
interpretation
of
the
convention.
the
convention
is
a
ratified
treaty,
and
under
our
constitution
such
treaties
are
federal
law,
part
of
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
but
also
under
our
constitution,
the
job
of
determining
federal
law
is
vested
in
the
federal
judiciary,
headed
by,
in
the
constitution’s
words,
“one
supreme
court”,
this
one.
of
course,
the
icj’s
rulings
are
the
decisions
of
an
international
court
regarding
the
meaning
of
an
international
treaty
and,
as
such,
are
entitled,
as
we
said
in
breard,
to
respectful
consideration.
but
even
according
that
consideration
here,
we
must
disagree
with
the
icj
about
the
import
of
article
36.
the
text
of
the
convention
makes
plain
that
article
36
is
to
be
implemented
in
conformity
with
domestic
laws
and
regulations.
among
those
laws
and
regulations
are
procedural-default
rules
which
in
our
system
apply
even
to
claimed
constitutional
violations,
let
alone
claim
violations
of
federal
statutory
rights.
the
icj’s
decisions
to
the
contrary
missed,
we
think,
the
importance
of
procedural
default
rules
in
our
adversary
system.
such
a
system
relies
chiefly
on
the
parties
to
raise
significant
issues
and
present
them
to
the
courts
in
the
appropriate
manner
and
at
the
appropriate
time.
many
of
the
countries
that
are
signatories
to
the
convention
have
inquisitorial,
magistrate-driven
legal
systems.
in
those
systems,
the
failure
to
raise
an
legal
error
can,
in
part,
be
attributed
to
the
investigating
magistrate
and,
thus,
to
the
state
itself.
but
in
our
system,
the
responsibility
for
failing
to
raise
an
issue
generally
rests
with
the
parties.
under
the
icj’s
reading
of
“full
effect”,
article
36
claims
could
trump
not
only
procedural-default
rules,
but
any
number
of
other
rules
requiring
parties
to
present
their
legal
claims
at
the
appropriate
time
and
in
the
appropriate
manner
for
adjudication.
bustillo
argues
article
36
rights
are
different,
because
a
defendant
may
not
even
be
aware
of
them
if
the
authorities
fail
to
inform
him
about
article
36.
but
consider
the
familiar
rights
under
miranda.
if
the
police
fail
to
give
a
defendant
miranda
warnings,
a
defendant
may
equally
say
that
he
was
not
aware
of
his
right,
say,
to
remain
silent
or
his
right
to
an
attorney.
nevertheless,
it
is
well-established
that
miranda
claims,
like
other
constitutional
claims,
are
subject
to
rules
of
procedural
default.
in
effect,
bustillo
asks
that
article
36
rights
be
treated
more
favorably
than
miranda
rights.
we
do
not
think
this
is
what
the
united
states
agreed
to
when
it
signed
the
convention.
we
have
applied
the
same
principles
to
article
36
that
we
would
apply
to
any
other
federal
right,
including
those
enshrined
in
our
constitution.
our
holding
thus
in
no
way
disparages
the
importance
of
the
vienna
convention.
the
relief
the
petitioners
request
is,
by
any

sanchez-llamas
seeks
a
suppression

for
an
asserted
right
with

procedural
rules
that
is

would
apply
to
an
act
of
congress
or
to
the
constitution
itself.
now,
because
neither
sanchez-llamas
nor
bustillo
is
entitled
under
the
convention
to
the
relief
they
see,
we
do
not
have
to
decide
the
question
whether
article
36
rights
are
ever
enforceable
in
court
by
individuals
or
instead
may
be
enforced
only
on
a
country-to-country
basis.
for
reason
stated
more

opinion

this
morning
with

the
judgments

courts
