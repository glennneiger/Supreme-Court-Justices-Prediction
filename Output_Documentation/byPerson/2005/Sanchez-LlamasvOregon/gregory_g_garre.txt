mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
failure
to
inform
a
foreign
national
that
his
consulate
may
be
notified
in
the
event
of
his
arrest
gives
rise
to
a
treaty
violation
between
sovereign
sates,
but
it
does
not
give
rise
to
an
individually
enforceable
right.
that
follows
from
the
text
of
the
vienna
convention
and
its
ratification
history--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
in
that
situation
you
would
have...
you
wouldn't
be
asserting
an
individual
right
under
the
treaty.
you
ultimately--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
could
be
situations--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
straight...
i
think
the
answer
would
be
is
you
would
have
a
treaty
violation
if
you
had
a
state
law
which
prevented
our
nation
from
giving
effect
to
our
obligations
under
the
vienna
convention--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
they
were
asserting
a
cause
of
action
under
state
property
law
and
that
were
the
result,
then
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that
would
be
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but...
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
these...
in
these
two
cases...
one
you
have
on
federal
habeas,
one
you
had
on
direct
appeal...
individuals
are
seeking
to
affirmatively
invoke
rights
that
they
claim
that
they
can
enforce
under
the
vienna
convention,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
vienna
convention
confers
those
individual
rights.
if...
if
i
could
try
to
explain
the...
the...
what
you
referred
to
as
a
metaphysical
question
earlier.
we
agree
that
the
vienna
convention,
as
a
self
executing
treaty,
is
part
of
our
federal
law.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito.
the...
the
treaty
has
an
enforcement
mechanism,
and
that's...
that's
an
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind.
the...
the
signatories
to
this
treaty
permitted
for
a
judicial
enforcement
mechanism.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right,
justice
alito.
the
remedy
would
be
the
traditional
remedy
for
enforcement
of
treaties,
diplomatic
repercussions,
diplomatic
protests,
and
that
happens
all
the
time.
that
happens
in
this
country
where
a...
where
consulates
complain
to
the
united
states
state
department.
it
happens
overseas
where
the
state
department
complains
about
the
treatment
of
american
citizens.
this...
this--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
your
honor,
and
what...
the
petitioners
and
their
amici
here
are
asking
this
court
to
be
the
first
court
to
recognize
an
individually
enforceable
right
under
this
treaty.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there...
there
is
australian
authority
going
directly
to
the
contrary.
it's...
it's
the
r.
v.
abbrederis
case
which
we
cite,
which...
which
recognizes
that
the
article
36
is
individually
enforceable.
the...
the
other
cases
that
are
referred
to
by
some
of
petitioners'
amici
are...
are
addressed
at
length
in
the
criminal
justice
legal
foundation
amicus
brief.
and
they
explain
that
in
those
situations,
there...
first
of
all,
the
cases
are
a
little
bit
vague
as
to
which
provisions
they're
purporting
to
enforce.
but,
second
of
all,
there
are
domestic
statutes
which
we
think
that
the
correct
reading
of
the
cases
is
in
those
cases
they
were
giving
effect
to
the
domestic
statutes.
there's
certainly
no...
no
unambiguous
example
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--because,
to
be
blunt,
the
icj
decision
is
wrong.
this
court
gives
respectful
consideration
to
the
decisions
of
the
icj
and
other
international
tribunals,
but
it's
certainly
not
bound
by
those
decisions.
this
court
should
look
carefully
to
the
text
of
the
treaty
itself,
to
the
ratification
history,
to
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
executive
branch,
and
to
implementing
practice
in
other
states.
at
best,
they...
petitioners
and
their
amici
have
suggested
that
there's
some
ambiguity
in...
in
two
states,
australia
and
great
britain.
there
are
more
than
160
contracting
states
to
this...
to
this
treaty.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
what
you
don't--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
are
authorities
that
we've
cited
where
courts
have
rejected
the
notion
that
article
36
creates
individually
enforceable
rights,
in
canada
and
australia,
and
there's
a
case
in
germany
where
they
refused
to
provide
for
a
suppression
remedy.
so
there
are
authorities
going
the
other
way.
the
manner
in
which
this
treaty
is
implemented
by
the
state
department
overseas
and
by
the
state
department
here
is
to
provide
for
enforcement
through
the
traditional
means.
this
court,
as
long
back
as
the
head
money
cases,
said
that
the
traditional...
treaties
are
compacts
between
states.
the
traditional
means
of
enforcing
those
obligations
is
through
diplomatic
repercussions.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
the
states
should
enforce
it
generally
by
giving
information
to
the
detainee
at
the
point
in
time
when
they
realize...
determine
that
he's
a
foreign
national.
the
state
department
is
engaged
in
extensive--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--generally--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--generally
it
happens
during
the
arrest
process.
if...
if,
during
the
course
of
questioning,
they
determine
that
a
detainee
or
arrestee
is
a
foreign
national,
then
at
that
point
in
time,
generally
they
would
provide
consular
notification.
the
state--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
state
department
advises
law
enforcement
officers
at
the
federal
and
state
and
local
level
that
ordinarily
they
should
make
that
determination.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
many
foreign
nationals
are
reluctant
to
provide
information
about
their
citizenship
because
they
fear
that
that
could
result
in
other
legal
jeopardy.
importantly,
justice
kennedy,
article
36
is
in
no
way
an
interrogation
right.
it
has
no
connection
to
interrogation.
the
international
court
of
justice
in
the
avena
decision,
at
page...
at
paragraph
87,
specifically
made
that
point,
that
this
was
not
related
to
interrogation.
in
many
european
countries,
detainees
who
are
arrested
not
only
can't
have
access
to
consular
officials
during
questioning,
they
don't
even
have
access
to
lawyers
during
questioning.
so...
so
this--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
when
they...
when
they
learn
that
the
person
is
a
foreign
national.
oftentimes,
that
could
happen...
that
could
happen
during
questioning,
although
oftentimes
it
doesn't.
it
could
happen
at
booking.
it
could
happen
later
in
the
process.
that's
what
the
state
department
advises
law
enforcement
officials.
the
state
department
has
engaged
in
extensive
efforts
to
ensure
compliance
with
this
treaty
in
order
to
abide
by
our
international
obligations.
we...
we
have
sent
information
to
state
and
local
law
enforcement
officers
how
to
comply
with
this
treaty.
there
have
been
training
videos.
there
have
been
cards
similar
to
miranda
cards.
more
than
600,000
of
those
cards
have
been
sent
out
to
local
officials,
and...
and
the
initial
indications
that
we've
received
is
that
these
efforts
are
working.
in
fact,
these
indicate...
these
efforts
are...
are
outlined
in
the
hardy
affidavit,
which
is
in
volume
ii
of
the
counter
memorial
and
avena
decision,
which
we've
offered
to
lodge
with
the
court.
but...
but
we...
the
feedback
we've
gotten
is
that
in
some
offices,
they're
being
overwhelmed
by
notifications.
so
the
united
states
is
seeking
to
abide
by
its
treaty
obligations.
those
efforts
are
working.
this--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
the
efforts
that
we
undertake
are
diplomatic
efforts.
we
do
not
go
into
foreign
courts
and
assert
or
suggest
that
american
citizens
should
go
into
foreign
courts
and
assert
a
right
to
individually
enforce
this
treaty
either
through
suppression
or
any
of
the
other
remedies
that
have
been
suggested.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
during
the
1980's
the
united
states
complained
to
mexico
about
the
fact
that
american
citizens
had
not
received
consular
notification,
and
through
the
result
of
those
diplomatic
discourses,
they
negotiated
an...
a
agreement
whereby
american
citizens
were
brought
back
to
the
united
states
for
custody.
but
significantly
there,
the...
the
united
states
didn't
take
the
position
that
those
convictions
were
unlawful
or
could
be
set
aside
under
the
vienna
convention.
they
simply,
through
diplomatic
discourse,
the
traditional
means
of
enforcing
a
treaty,
provided
for
the...
the
transfer
of
these
citizens
back
to
the
united
states
to
serve
out
their
custody.
the...
the
traditional
rule
in
international
law
is
that
treaties
don't
create
individually
enforceable
rights.
many
treaties,
by
their
terms,
do
expressly
contemplate
private
enforcement
in
domestic
courts.
look
at
article
28
of
the
warsaw
convention.
look
at
article
2,
subsection
3
of
the
international
covenant
on
civil
and
political
rights.
these
treaties
do
expressly
contemplate
that
theirs...
their
provisions
will
be
individually
enforceable
in
the
domestic
courts.
it
would
have
been--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
they
refer
to
rights
that
individuals
can
assert
or
should
be
able
to
assert
in
judicial
courts,
in
the
domestic
courts.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
there...
your
honor,
there
are
varying
degrees
of
specificity,
but
yes,
they...
in
some
cases
they
do
provide
for
that
explicitly.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
they...
they
refer
to
domestic
enforcement.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
they
didn't,
your
honor,
but
those
treaties,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
are
dealing
with
commercial
relations,
property
rights,
and...
and
are
almost
entirely
dealing
with
individuals
and
how
they
should
be
treated
in
foreign
states,
are
much
more
amenable
to
a
construction
that
they
create
individually
enforceable
rights.
and
the
vienna
convention,
which
after
all
is
a
convention
about
the
quintessential
matter
of
interstate
relations,
consular
functions
between
states...
we
don't
think
that
that
treaty
can
be
interpreted
to
confer
individually
enforceable
rights.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--read--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
would
suggest
read
the
treaty.
it's...
it's...
we
agree
with
you
that
you
get
back
to
the
treaty
and
you
have
to
make
the
determination
that
the
signatory
states
to
the
treaty
intended
for
private
enforcement
in
domestic
courts.
the
signatory
states
to
this
treaty
provided
for
a
very
limited
judicial
enforcement
mechanism,
only
contracting
states
that
join
the
optional
protocol
and
only
in
the
icj.
it
would
have
been
an
extraordinary
thing
for
those
contracting
states
that
so
carefully
limited
that
remedy
to...
to
subject
themselves
to
suit
in
their
own
courts
to
any
number
of
foreign
nationals
who
went
abroad
into
their
countries.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
what
you...
what
you...
what
they're
asking
you
to
do,
your
honor,
is
to
say
that
this
treaty
is
individually
enforceable
in
our
courts.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
is,
your
honor,
insofar
as
if
you
think
it
in
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
terms.
a
state
may
waive
its
sovereign
immunities
from
some
types
of
claims,
but
not
other
types
of
claims.
and
what
they're
claiming
here
is
that
these
claims
are
enforceable,
and
we
think
that
they
are
incorrect.
