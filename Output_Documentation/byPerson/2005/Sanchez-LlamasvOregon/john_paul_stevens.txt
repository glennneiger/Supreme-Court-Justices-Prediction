well,
it
does
obligate
immediate
notification
to
the
defendant,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
there
are
two
different
without
delay
points,
one,
when
you
tell
the...
the
defendant;
and
secondly,
whether
or
not
he
wants
the
consulate
notified,
and
there's
the
second
delay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
little
while
ago
you
were
asked
about
the
judge
asking
whether
or
not
to
ask
the
defendant
if
the
advice
was
given
him.
and
the
suggestion
was
made
there's
no
duty
on
the
state
judge
to
enforce
a
federal
treaty,
but
if
it's
a
matter
of
federal
law,
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
duty
to...
on
the
judge
to
obey
federal
law
if...
if
it
is
part
of
our
federal
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know,
one
thing
i
find
difficulty
understanding
in
this
case
is
i
just
can't
understand
how
a
lawyer
thought
it
would
be
to
his
client's
advantage
not
to
consul...
not
to
tell
the
consul
because
the
facts
are
quite
persuasive
that
he
really
was
severely
prejudiced
by
the
fact
he
didn't
get
all
the
help
he
could
have
gotten.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how...
how
could
he
make
such
a
judgment?
i
just
don't
understand
it.
you
know--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
the
prejudice
is
just
stark
in...
in
this
case.
it
just
stands
out
and...
and
you
just
wonder
what
was
going
on
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
might
be
likely
if
there
had
been
a
history
of
these
claims
being
successful,
but
none
has
ever
prevailed.
so
i
doubt
if
that
would
be
very...
very
good
to
figure
you
can,
you
know,
save
your...
your
key
argument
that
has
no
precedent
of
winning.
