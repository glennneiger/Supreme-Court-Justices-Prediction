justice

bader

and
at
least
you
have
the
authority
of
the
international
court
of
justice
that
says
this
is
a
right.
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
between
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
times
now
has
the
icj
said
that
this
convention
confers
rights
on
the
individual?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
is
the
view
of
our
treaty
partners
on
that
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
at
the
time
this
treaty
came
into
force.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
at
the
time
the
vienna
convention
came
into
force.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
were
almost
alone
in
having
suppression
as
the
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
think
that
the...
that
the
remedy
that
the
icj
imposed
in
the
case
where
the
united
states
was
before
it
as
a
party,
that
that
would
be
the
appropriate
remedy?
it
was
not
suppression.
it
was
reconsider
this,
taking
account
of
the
failure
to
notify
and
what
might
have
happened
if
notice
had
been
provided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
wasn't
any
word
in
either
of
the
icj
judgments,
if
i
recall
them
correctly,
that
said,
united
states,
you
have
a
suppression
remedy,
so
you
should
suppress.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
do
know,
don't
we,
mr.
gartlan,
that
if
the
treaty
had
been
followed,
it
still
would
have
been
permissible
for
the
police,
having
given
miranda
warnings,
to
commence
interrogation?
the
treaty
does
not
require
that
the
enforcing
officials
in
this
country
immediately
call
the
foreign
consulate.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
promptness.
and
i
think
that
the
united
states
has
told
us
it's
generally
done
here
somewhere
between
24
and
72
hours.
a
suspect
who
has
been
given
miranda
warnings
as
here...
the
conversation
with
the
police,
the
interrogation,
could
begin
before
that
24
hours
or
72
hours
expires.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
this
case,
wasn't
it
true
that
the
trial
counsel
knew
about
the
vienna
convention
right
and,
for
whatever
reason,
thought
his
client
would
not
be
aided
by
talking
to
the
honduran
counsel...
consul.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
problem
at
the
trial
level,
i
think,
is
you
would
be...
you
couldn't
make
it
at
that
stage
because
it's
the
very
lawyer
who's
ineffective.
here,
it
was
raised
by
a
new
counsel
on
appeal,
and
that's
really
the
first
opportunity
it
could
come
up
because
the...
the
lawyer
who
didn't
give
this
advice
certainly
isn't
going
to
say,
in...
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
i
was
ineffective.
so...
and
that's
i
think
the
point
that
the
icj
was
trying
to
make
when
it
said
you
couldn't
use
the
procedural
default
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
other
relief
sought
by
the
petitioner?
there
was
the
suppression
request.
was
there
any
other?
was
there
a
request
of
the
kind
that
the
icj
thought
would
be
appropriate,
which
was,
court,
reconsider
this
and
determine
whether
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
by
the
absence
of
vienna
convention
notice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
question
i
would
like
to
ask
you
about
the
state.
now,
if
everything
worked
ideally,
it
would
be
the
police
officer,
along
with
the
miranda
warnings,
says,
would
you
like
to
call
your
consulate.
you
could
do
that
if
you
wish.
if
it...
if
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
give
this
information
under
the
treaty,
but
many
police
officers
don't
know
anything
about
any
vienna
convention,
do
judges,
federal
judges,
state
judges,
have
an
obligation,
when
they
see
that
an
alien
defendant
is
before
them,
to,
on
the
judge's
own
motion,
ask
the
prosecutor
has
he
been
told
about
the
vienna
convention,
and
if
not,
the
judge
would
have
an
obligation
to
do
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
first
time
it
was
raised
was
on
direct
appeal
by
appellate
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
reason
for
the
denial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
that
counsel
said
that
the...
the
people
at
the
consulate...
they
tend
to
talk
a
lot?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it
worked
the
other
way
around
when
a
young
american
citizen
is
detained
in...
in
a
jail
someplace
abroad,
and
has
the
united
states
ever
then...
what
efforts
have
been
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it
worked
anyplace?
take
mexico,
turkey,
any
country
you'd
like.
