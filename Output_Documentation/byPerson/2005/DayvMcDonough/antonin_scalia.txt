justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
other
side
may
say,
"although
technically
the
statute
of
limitations
applied
here,
taking
all
considerations
into
account
we
think
that
this
prisoner
acted
with
reasonable
promptness,
and
perhaps
the
delay
was
somewhat
attributable
to
the
state.
"
do
you
think
that
that's
a
proper
consideration?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
it
could
be
argued
that
the
federal
government
wants
to
move
them
along
speedily,
whether
or
not
the
state
government
wants
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
that
would
suggest
that
the
state's
voluntary
waiver
of
a
statute
of
limitations
should
not
make
any
difference.
it's
a
federal...
it's
a
federal
interest
involved,
not
a
state
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does...
proceeding
under
15
does
not
do
that;
whereas,
proceeding
this
way
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
wink,
wink?
justice
antonin
scalia
must
there
be
good
reasons
for
the
judge
to
say,
quote,
"i'm
surprised
that
you
haven't
raised
a
statute
of
limitations
defense?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
must
there
be
good
reason
for
that?
and,
if
not,
aren't
you
asking
us
to
waste
our
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
do
it
the
easier
way
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
what's
your
answer
as
to
whether
there
is
any
limitation
on
the
judge
just
suggesting,
"by
the
way,
you
know,
is
there
some
reason
why
you
haven't
pleaded
statute
of
limitations?
"
can
a...
can
a
judge
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what...
when
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you'd
say
it
would
be
okay
if
the
state
didn't
expressly
concede
the
statute
of
limitations
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
what
i
thought
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--position
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so,
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
fallback
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
the
court
"must".
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't
you
think
that's
what
this
court
thought?
and,
if
so,
shouldn't
we
perhaps
send
it
back
to
see
whether,
if
the
court
knew
that
it
had
discretion,
it
would
have
done
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
congress
wanted
to
leave
it
to
the
state
to
waive
the
statute
of
limitations
provision?
how
could
it
have
made
that
clear?
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
that
if
they
made
it
a
statute
of
limitations
provision
instead
of
a
jurisdictional
provision...
i
mean,
they
could
have
said,
you
know,
"no
jurisdiction
if
it's
filed
beyond
a
certain
date,
and
we
mean
it.
"
but
it
put
it
as
a
statute
of
limitation,
which
normally
is
waivable.
and
i
would
think
that
that
is
an
indication
that
congress
thought,
"really,
if
the
state
thinks
that
in
this
particular
case
we
shouldn't
hew
to
the
technicality
of
the
statute
of
limitation,
the
state
ought
to
be
able
to
waive
it.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
always
a
technicality.
what
you're
saying
is,
the
only
time
that
the
state
can
do
that
is
when
the
answer
to
the
statute
of
limitations
is
unclear.
and
i'm
saying
sometimes
the
state
may
say,
"the
answer
is
clear,
but
doggone
it,
this
is
just
too
picky
picky,
too
technical
in
this
particular
case.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
at
least
this
much,
or
am
i
incorrect?
and
it's
important
for
me
to
know
that.
you
acknowledge
at
least
this
much,
that
if
we
read
this
opinion,
as
you
do
not,
to
be
saying
that
the
court
"must"
do
this
so
that
the
court
was
not
really
considering
all
factors
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
we
would
have
to
remand.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
from
what
you
just
said,
i
take
it
that
means
that
even
when
the
state
is
unwilling
to
change
its
mind
and
says,
"no,
we
would
still
prefer
not
to
assert
the
defense.
"
you
would
allow
the
court
to
impose
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
answer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
of
course,
"may"
is...
"may"
is
embraced
within
"must".
if
you
"must",
you
"may".
