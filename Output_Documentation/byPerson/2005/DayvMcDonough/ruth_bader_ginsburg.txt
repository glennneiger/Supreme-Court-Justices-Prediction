it
was
a
computation
error.
this
is
not
a...
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
state
chose
to
waive
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
miscalculated.
isn't
that
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
not...
and
we
didn't
take
cert
to
decide
if
this
claim
was
timely.
we
are
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
untimely.
but...
and
what
are
the
consequences
of
the
state's
failing
to
raise
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
whole
basis
was
the
number
of
days
that
they
calculated,
and
the
magistrate
said,
"oh,
they
miscalculated.
"
"there
were
more
days
involved.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--suppose
the
magistrate
judge
had
said,
"i
notice
this
error
in
accordance
with
eleventh
circuit
law,
so
i
am
going
to
suggest
to
the
state
that
they
amend
their
answer.
"
the
state
certainly
could...
under
rule
15,
if
the
federal
rules
apply,
the
state
could
have
amended
its
answer
and
done
just
what
the
magistrate
judge
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
it
say
"an
obligation",
or
that
the
court
"could"?
it
didn't...
i
didn't
think
it
said
the
court
"must".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is...
i
see...
you're
referring
to
page
4(a)
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
which...
where
is
the
sentence
that
says
it...
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that
that
duty
is
in
connection
with
rule
4.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we
could--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
could...
we
could
agree
with
you
that
there
is
isn't
an
obligation
on
the
federal
judge
to
raise
it,
but
the
question
is,
you
know,
the...
it
could
be
a
"must",
it
can
be
"may
not",
or
it
could
be
"may".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
shouldn't
we
treat
this
as
a
"may"?
the
judge
noticed
the
clerical
error
and
called
it
to
the
party's
attention
by
an
order
to
show
cause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
past
rule
4,
because
an
answer
has
been
ordered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
and
it's
only
when
the
answer
comes
in
that
this
issue
is
spotted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
very
what
standards?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
"leave
shall
be
freely
given".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
would
be
the
prejudice
that
could
be
claimed
by
the
habeas
petitioner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
couldn't
do
this
under
rule
4,
because,
as
you,
i
think,
recognized,
that,
just
from
the
petition,
from
the
habeas
petition,
you
couldn't
tell.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
the
civil
rules
allow
for
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
8(c),
and
there's
12(b),
but
there's
also
15.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
the
height
of
technicality
to
say
that
the
judge
could
suggest,
"now,
state,
i
will
entertain
a
motion
to
amend
the
answer,
under
rule
15.
"
instead
of
saying,
"i'm
issuing
an
order
to
show
cause
why
this
action
is
not
out
of
time.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
those--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--cases...
were
those
cases
of
a
miscalculation
on
the
part
of
the
state?
the
judge's
view
was
that
the
state
had
miscalculated
under
eleventh
amendment...
under
eleventh
circuit
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here,
nothing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--happened.
nothing
happened.
there
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
answer
was
put
in,
and
then
there
were
no
further
proceedings.
nothing
else
went
on
in
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
quite
different...
i
don't
know
any
judge
that
would
allow
a
defendant,
after
the
trial
is
over,
to
raise
the
statute
of
limitations.
but,
up
front,
it's
a
different
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but,
mr.
kise,
the...
mr.
busby
told
us
that
the
reference
was
in
the
following
paragraph,
and
it
is
the
sentence,
"a
federal
court
that
sits
in
collateral
review
of
a
criminal
judgment
of
a
state
court
has
an
obligation
to
enforce
the
federal
statute
of
limitations.
"
that's
the
sentence
that
suggests
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
there
was
an
obligation,
the
district
court,
to
raise
the
statute
of
limitations
on
its
own
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say
it's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--means
it's
"hardly
ever"?
i
mean,
we
do
follow
the
principle
of
party
presentation.
and
judges
are
not
supposed
to
be
intruding
issues
on
their
own,
they
are
supposed
to
follow
the
party's
presentation.
so,
would
this
be...
if
it's
not
"never",
would
it
be
at
least
"hardly
ever",
that
it's
appropriate
for
a
judge
to
interject
an
affirmative
defense
on
his
own
motion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
in
granberry
the
court
gave
the
court
of
appeals
that
discretion,
since
it
hadn't...
the
point
had
been
missed
in
the
district
court,
been
missed
by
everybody,
until
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
would
you
deal
with
that
hypothetical
when
the
eleventh
circuit,
in
all
fairness,
said,
"we
join
the
second,
fourth,
fifth,
and
ninth
circuit,
and
rule
that,
even
though
the
statute
of
limitations
is
an
affirmative
defense,
the
district
court
may
review
the
timeliness
of
the
2254.
"
that's
what...
the
question
that
the
court
thought
it
was
deciding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
generally.
statute
of
limitations,
like
res
judicata,
they
are
8(c)
affirmative
defenses,
and
preclusion
doctrine
is
for
the
party
to
waive
or
not,
just
like
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
don't
think
there's
any
rule
that
says
a
judge
in
the
run
of
the
mine
case
acts
properly
by
interjecting
preclusion
into
a
case
where
no
party
has
raised
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
a
federal
court’s
authority,
unprompted
by
a
party,
to
raise
a
question
concerning
the
timeliness
of
a
petition
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
federal
statute
at
issue
allows
one
year
for
state
prisoners
to
file
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
seeking
federal-court
review
of
the
legality
of
their
imprisonment.
the
time
clock
for
such
petitions
starts
once
the
prisoner’s
state
conviction
becomes
final.
in
this
case,
florida
prisoner
patrick
day
filed
a
petition
for
federal
habeas
relief,
and
the
state
conceded
the
timeliness
of
his
petition.
the
u.s.
magistrate
judge
assigned
to
review
day’s
petition,
however,
noticed
the
state
had
made
a
computation
error.
under
the
controlling
circuit
precedent,
a
correct
calculation
would
have
revealed
the
untimeliness
of
day’s
petition.
the
judge
called
the
calculation
error
to
the
parties’
attention
and
gave
day
an
opportunity
to
show
why
his
petition
should
not
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
meet
the
statutory
deadline.
day
was
unable
to
justify
the
late
filing.
the
u.s.
district
court
therefore
dismissed
day’s
petition,
and
the
dismissal
was
upheld
by
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
11th
circuit,
whose
judgment
we
now
affirm.
the
question
presented
is
one
on
which
courts
of
appeals
have
divided.
may
a
u.s.
trial-court
judge,
acting
on
his
or
her
own
initiative,
raise
an
issue
as
to
the
timeliness
of
a
state
prisoner’s
federal
habeas
corpus
petition?
ordinarily,
a
defending
party,
here
the
state
of
florida,
forfeits
an
objection
to
the
opposing
party’s
pleading
as
untimely
if
the
objection
is
not
asserted
in
the
answer
to
the
opening
pleading
or
in
an
amendment
thereto.
in
day’s
case,
the
state
did
not
intelligently
forego
the
objection.
its
assumption
that
day’s
petition
was
timely
stemmed
from
an
evident
miscalculation.
it
would
have
been
proper,
all
members
of
this
court
agree,
if
the
federal
judge
instead
of
acting
on
his
own
initiative
had
informed
the
state
of
the
computation
error
and
invited
amendment
of
the
state’s
answer
to
allege
the
time
bar.
that
move,
as
the
court’s
majority
sees
it,
is
substantially
equivalent
to
the
path
taken
here.
in
the
opinion
released
today,
we
hold
that
in
the
circumstances
day’s
case
presents
an
apparent
counting
slip
on
the
part
of
the
state.
no
rule,
statute
or
constitutional
provision
commands
the
judge
who
spotted
the
error
to
suppress
that
knowledge.
the
judge,
we
stress,
is
not
obliged
to
check
the
state’s
math
to
uncover
a
miscalculation
and
then
raise
the
timeliness
of
the
prisoner’s
habeas
petition
sua
sponte.
our
opinion
rejects
both
an
inflexible
rule
requiring
dismissal
whenever
the
court
notices
that
the
one-year
clock
has
run
and,
at
the
opposite
pole,
a
rule
treating
the
state’s
failure
initially
to
plead
the
one-year
time
bar
as
an
irretrievable
forfeiture.
we
hold
simply
and
only
that
upon
noticing
a
calculation
error,
a
federal
court
has
discretion
to
ask
and
answer
this
question:
is
the
administration
of
justice
better
served
by
dismissing
the
case
as
time-barred
or
by
reaching
the
merits
of
the
petition?
two
dissenting
opinions
have
been
filed,
one
by
justice
stevens,
in
which
justice
breyer
joins;
the
other
by
justice
scalia,
in
which
justice
thomas
and
justice
breyer
join.
