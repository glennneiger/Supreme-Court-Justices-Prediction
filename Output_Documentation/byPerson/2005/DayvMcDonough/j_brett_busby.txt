mr.
j.
brett
busby
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
state
does
not
dispute
that
it
waived
the
affirmative
defense
of
limitations
by
failing
to
raise
it
in
the
district
court
and
by
conceding
in
its
answer
that
day's
petition
was
timely.
yet,
nearly
a
year
into
the
case,
after
the
parties
had
briefed
the
merits,
the
magistrate
judge
not
only
raised
an
argument
that
the
petition
was
untimely,
he
actually
imposed
the
state's
limitations
defense
and
dismissed
the
case,
despite
the
state's
procedural
default
and
contrary
concession.
that
was
error,
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
violates
the
general
principle
of
the
adversary
system
in
the
civil
rules
that
it's
error
to
impose
a
forfeited
limitations
defense
sua
sponte,
and
the
statutory
text
in
rules
have
confirmed
that
this
principle
applies
to
habeas.
second,
the
state's
concession
of
timeliness
based
on
full
information
was
an
express
binding
waiver,
and
it
was
error
for
the
district
court
to
override
that
concession.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
well,
there
was
a
1-day
miscalculation,
justice
ginsburg,
on
the...
on
the
352
versus
353
days
before
the...
mr.
day
filed
his
state
postconviction
petition.
but
there's
a
legal
dispute
as
to
whether
the
days
after...
between
the
time...
whether
the--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--well,
our
position
is
that
by
expressly
conceding
in
their
petition
that
it
was
timely,
that
that's
an
express
waiver.
i
mean,
they
say
that
they
would
have...
what
they
would
have
had
to
say
was,
"we
know
we
have
a
limitations
defense.
"
"we're
expressly
giving
that
up,
that
the
proper
standard
is
the
intentional
relinquishment
of--
"
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--"#
a
known
right".
mr.
j.
brett
busby
the...
yes,
under
eleventh
circuit
law,
the
magistrate
said
they
should
have
counted
that
additional
time
at
the
end.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
but
this
court
has
said
that
the
standard
for...
the
standard
for
express
waiver
varies,
depending
on
the
right
at
stake.
it's
not
always
intentional
relinquishment
of
a
known
right,
as
it
is
with
some
constitutional
rights.
in
fact,
there
are
several
courts
of
appeals
that
have
said
when
you
plead...
when
you
affirmatively
plead
the
opposite
of
an
affirmative
defense,
as
they
did
here
by
saying
it's
timely,
that
that's
enough
for
an
express
waiver.
and--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--this
court--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--well,
certainly,
your
honor,
they
could
have
moved
to
amend
their
answer.
we
would
have
opposed
it;
and
would,
on
remand,
if
the
issue
were
to
come
up,
on
the
ground
that
they
had
full
information,
and
so
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
to
amend
an
answer.
but
i
agree
with
you
that
that
would
have
been
one
option,
and
that's
the
way
that
the
third
circuit
analyzes
this
issue
in
the
long
case
and
in
the
bendolph
case,
using
the
principles
of
rule
15.
the
fifth...
the
eleventh
circuit
did
not
do
that
here.
it
said
that
there
was
an
obligation
for
the
court
to
impose
the
limitations
defense;
it
did
not
apply
the
rule
15--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--analysis.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
it
did
say,
your
honor,
that
there
was
an
obligation
for
the
court
to
impose
it
to
further
comity,
finality,
and
federalism,
and
that
can
be
found
on
page
5(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
"a
federal
court
that
sits
in
collateral
review
has
an
obligation
to
enforce
the
federal
statute
of
limitations.
"
and,
in
fact,
they
quote
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
rule
4,
saying
the
court
has
the
duty
to
screen
out.
and
they
also
expressly
distinguished
their
precedent
in
esslinger
versus
davis,
which
relied
on
granberry
versus
greer,
to
say
it
was
a
discretionary
analysis.
they
said,
"we're
not
going
to
consider
the
discretionary
issues
raised
in
esslinger
and
granberry
whether
this
dismissal
would
serve
an
important
federal
interest.
"
"we're
just
going
to
say
there's
an
obligation
to
impose
this,
and
that
the
district--
"
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--5(a),
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
the
obligation
is
seven
lines
from
the
bottom,
and
it's
that
last
paragraph,
where
they're
distinguishing
esslinger.
and
the
sentence
of
the
previous
paragraph
is
where
they
say
there's
a
"duty".
mr.
j.
brett
busby
yes,
your
honor,
and
then
they...
they
rely
on
that
duty
to
say
that
there
is
an
obligation,
in
the
next
paragraph,
and
to
distinguishing
essingler
and
say,
"we
don't
have
to
go
through
this
discretionary
analysis,
because
there's
an
obligation.
"
and
so,
our
position
is
that
even--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--well,
we
don't
necessarily
agree,
your
honor,
if...
we
don't
necessarily
agree
that--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--under
rule
4?
mr.
j.
brett
busby
well,
your
honor,
if
you'd
look
at
what
rule--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--uh
huh.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--that
they
must
do
that,
because,
as
this
court
recognized
in
pliler
versus
ford,
it's
almost
never
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
petition--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--that
there's
an--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--open
and
shut--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--okay.
i
would
think
that
even
if
it
were
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
petition,
that
the...
rule
4
has
two
parts.
in
the
first
part
of
it,
the
nonadversary
screening
function,
only
applies
when
the
petitioner
is
plainly
not
entitled
to
relief.
and
i
think
the
better
view
of
that...
of
that
clause
is...
although
there
are
some
arguments
in
our
brief
that
don't
take
this
view...
i...
after
having
given
it
thought,
i
think
the
better
view
of
that
clause
is
that
it
does
not
apply
to
an
affirmative
defense
that's
subject
to
waiver
or
tolling,
that
you
can't
say,
based
on
an
affirmative
defense
that's
subject
to
waiver
or
tolling,
that
someone
is
plainly
not
entitled
to
relief.
you
could
say,
for
example--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--or
it
might
be
tolled,
your
honor.
and
there
are
also
four
different
trigger
dates
in
the
statute
for
when
it
can
first
apply,
that
you
aren't
going
to
be
able
to
tell,
necessarily,
three
of
them
from
the
face
of
the
petition.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
absolutely,
your
honor.
there...
the
statute
of
limitations
in
aedpa
is
designed
to
prevent
delay,
not
to...
as
congress
has
said,
it's
not
a
forfeiture
provision;
it's
designed
to
move
these
complaints
along
speedily,
particularly
in
capital
cases,
of
which
this
is
not
one.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
certainly.
and
their--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--well,
they...
there
is
an
interest
in
judicial
efficiency
that's
at
issue
here,
too,
but
we
submit
that
it's
far
more
inefficient
for
the
court
to
put
limitations
under
this
first
category
of
rule
4
and
say
that
the
court
must,
on
its
own,
look
at
limitations
every
time,
without
assistance
from
the
parties,
than
it
is
to
make
the
state
do
its
job.
i
mean,
they're
the
ones,
as
this--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--court
recognized--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
well,
the
proper
procedure
under
rule
4
is
not
to
call
it
to
the
party's
attention
in
that
way;
it's--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
yes.
that's
correct.
and
i
agree
with
you
that
the
proper
procedure
after
that
would
be
to
bring
the
issue
to
the
party's
attention
and
let
the
state
decide
whether
it
wanted
to
file
a
motion
to
amend
under
rule
15;
and,
if
it
did
so,
there
are
very
clear
standards
that
are
applied,
that
were
not
applied
in
this
case,
to
decide--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--there
are
very
clear
standards,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--yes,
but
there
are
also...
it's
a...
again,
it's
a
discretionary
determination,
and
there
are
prejudice
issues
that
should
be
considered
as
the--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--well,
the
prejudice
in
this
case
is
that
the
standards
of
rule
15
were
not
considered;
but,
in
addition,
there
are...
there
are
well
recognized
decisions,
both
from
this
court
and
from
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
went...
that
says
a
judge
may
deny
leave
to
amend
when
the...
at
the
time
the
concession
is
made.
and
the
answer...
the
state
had
full
information.
and
the
state
admits
here
that
it
had
all
the
information
it
needed
to
make
the
limitations
calculation
attached
to
its
answer,
in
which
it
conceded
timeliness,
and
then...
but
then
waited
a
year,
or
several
months,
to
bring
it
up
later.
and
so,
we
would
argue,
if
this
were
a
rule
15
analysis,
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
allow
the
amendment.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
now,
also--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--well,
that
would
be...
that's
the
respondent's
position,
and
i
think,
in
addition
to
those
considerations,
if
you
disagree
that
this
is
a
forfeiture,
that...
and
you
disagree
that
this
is
an
express
waiver,
and
you
get
to
their
position
that,
you
know,
this
is
a
discretionary
test
and
you
should
just
apply
the
same
rule
15
factors,
i
think
you
need
to
also
apply
a
presumption
against
sua
sponte
consideration.
there's
one
way
to
do
it
under
rule
4,
and
that's
the
most
efficient
way.
it's
also
the
way
that
comports
with
judicial
neutrality
in
the
adversary
system.
and
so,
to
encourage
people--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--ginsburg,
i
misspoke.
i
meant
to
say
rule
15.
but
if...
to
encourage
parties
to
do
this
under
rule
15,
the
court
should
adopt
a
presumption
against
sua
sponte
consideration.
and
this...
in
arizona
versus
california,
which
they
rely
on
heavily,
they
say
that
this
type
of
consideration
should
be
reserved
for
rare
circumstances.
and
we
cite
several
cases
in
our
brief
where
that...
that
also
support
that
proposition.
so,
we
would
submit,
if
you
do
get
to
this
analysis,
justice
alito,
that
there
should
also
be
a
presumption
involved.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
not
necessarily.
i
mean,
there...
but
we
do
submit
that
the
timing
issue
that
we
just
raised,
about
them
having
full
information,
would
certainly
be
something
we'd
argue
to
the
district
court
in
its
discretion.
but
another
thing
you
have
to
consider,
to
your
point,
is
that
limitations
is
something
that's...
that
has
a
subtle
meaning
and
derive...
and
is
directly
addressed
by
civil
rules
8
and
12.
and
this
court,
in
gonzalez
and
mayle,
says
that
when
that
happens,
that's
where
you
start,
with
the
civil
rules.
and
then
you
ask
if
there's
anything
in
the
habeas
statutes
or
rules
that's
inconsistent
with
that
approach,
with
the...
with
the
forfeiture
approach
of
the
civil
rules.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
yes,
i
agree.
and
that
was
not
used
in
this
case.
i...
and
i...
we
agree
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
way
to
raise
this.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
well,
i
don't
agree,
your
honor,
because
there's
a
specific
analysis
that
goes
along
with
rule
15
that
wasn't
applied
here.
but,
in
addition
to
that,
there's
an
efficiency
interest
to
be
served
by
having
the
state
calculate
and
make
the
motion,
rather
than
putting
the
burden
on
the
federal
court
to
do
it.
the
court,
we
submit,
should
make
the
state...
they...
this
court,
in
pliler,
said
the
state's
in
the
best
position
to
make
the
limitations
calculation.
it's
an
error
prone
fact
intensive,
burdensome
calculation,
and
they
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
foist
that
burden
on
the
court.
the
court
should
make
them
do
their
job.
and
so,
our
position
is
that
that's
the
reason
that
it
should
be
done
under
rule
15.
it
also
doesn't
put
the
state
in
the
position
of
being
an
advocate...
excuse
me...
it
doesn't
put
the
court
in
the
position
of
being
an
advocate
for
the
state
and
having
them
say...
having
the
court
directly
across
the
bench
from
the
petitioner,
not
involving
the
state,
saying,
"here
are...
i'm
developing
some
arguments
on
behalf
of
the
state
now
why
this
is
untimely.
"
"what
do
you
have
to
say
about
it?
"
that's--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--well,
proceeding
under
15,
i...
proceeding
under
15,
you
would
say
to
the
state,
"do
you
want
to
make
a
motion
to
amend?
"
mr.
j.
brett
busby
well...
but--
[laughter]
i
mean,
there
is
some
value
in
that,
i
think,
particularly
where
the
state
has
expressly
conceded
timeliness.
i
mean,
the
magistrate
judge
in
this
case,
all
that
he
had
before
him
was
the
express
concession
from
the
state.
he
never...
the
state
never
said
anything
in
the
district
court,
even
after
he
issued
his
notice
to
the
petitioner
to
show
cause
why
it
wasn't
untimely.
so,
the
magistrate
judge,
all
he
had
before
him
was
the
state's
position
that
it
was
timely.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
in
granberry
the
state
raised
the
issue
for
the
first
time
on
appeal,
the
court
did
not.
so,
there,
you
do
have
the
adversary
system
at
work.
in
addition,
granberry
is
different
for
several
other
reasons.
exhaustions
is,
unlike
limitations,
unique
to
habeas
corpus;
it's
not
covered
by
rule
8.
and,
also,
it's
a
common
law
limit
that
this
court
has
developed
on
habeas
relief.
it's
not
a
statutory
affirmative
defense.
and,
as
our
brief
points
out,
congress
has
treated
these
very
differently
when
it
codified
them
in
aedpa.
and
this
applies
not
only
to
exhaustion,
but
nonretroactivity,
abuse
of
the
writ,
and
procedural
default.
i'm
sorry,
procedural
default
was
not
codified.
but
they
other
defenses...
the
other
limits
on
habeas
relief
that
the
petitioner
relies
on
were
codified
very
differently
in
aedpa;
whereas,
for
exhaustion
it
says,
"relief
shall
not
be
granted
unless
you
exhaust.
"
that's
a
substantive
limit
on
relief.
for
limitations,
however,
it
says
when
you're--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
brett
busby
potentially,
yes,
if
you
codify
it
as
a
substantive
limit
on
relief.
whereas,
limitations
is
simply
codified...
it
says,
"a
period
of
limitations
shall
apply.
"
it
doesn't
say,
"relief
shall
not
be
granted
unless
you
file
within
one
year.
"
it
doesn't
even
say,
as
it
does
in
the
capital
context,
for
certain...
for
capital
opt
in
states,
that
it
must
be
filed
by
a
certain
time.
it
just
says
"a
period
of
limitation".
and
that
has
a
settled
meaning
that
goes
along
with
it.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
yes,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--yes.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
well,
i--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--i'm
not--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--one--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--uh
huh.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
certainly.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
and
there
could
be--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--good
reasons
to
amend.
for
example,
the
bendolph
case
that
you
have
before
you,
there
was
an
alteration
in
a
date,
and
the
third
circuit
didn't
ascribe
that
to
any
particular
person,
but,
nonetheless,
the
documents
that
the
state
had
before
it
had
the
wrong
date
on
it
from
which
to
calculate.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
well,
i--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
you're...
if
you
put...
if
you
put
limitations
as
something
that
the
judge
must
raise,
i
think
you're
asking
the
judge
to
waste
his
time
rather
than
leaving
it
to
the
parties
to
raise
it.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
well,
i
would
think
that,
you
know,
it
would
be
evaluated
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
and
i
haven't...
i
haven't
given
much--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--for
a
judge
to--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--invite
the
state
to
amend?
mr.
j.
brett
busby
i
would
say
if...
it
would
be,
in
this
case,
perhaps,
because
of
the
state's
express
concession
to
the
contrary,
and...
so
that
that
might
be
one
circumstance.
but
i
don't
think
this--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--court
needs
to--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--circumscribe--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--that's
a
good
point,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
circumscribe
the
judge's
authority
to
suggest
an
amendment.
i
think
you
could
wrap
it
all
into
the
ruling
and
evaluate
that
for
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
i
would
agree
with
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
well,
because
in
this
case
you
have
an
express
concession.
and
so,
it's
a...
this
court
has
said,
and
other
courts
have
said,
that
when
you
have
an
express
concession,
it's
error
to
override
that
concession
and
impose
the
defense
sua
sponte.
the
court
should,
instead,
assume
that
the
concession
is
valid
and
that
refusal
to
honor
it
is
an
abuse
of
discretion.
you--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--don't
want
to
strip--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--well,
your
honor,
most
of
those
cases
involved
other
issues,
like
exhaustion
and
procedural
default,
where
the
state
later
came
back
and
said,
"we
were
mistaken
that
they
exhausted.
"
or,
"we
were
mistaken
that
they
didn't
procedurally
default
this
claim.
"
so,
it's
a
similar
mistake
claim,
but,
nonetheless,
the
state
affirmatively
pleaded
the
opposite
of
either
exhaustion,
procedural
default,
or
limitations.
and
the
court
held
them
to
that.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
possibly.
but,
again,
i
think
if
you...
if
you
use
the
analysis
of
the
civil
rules
that
applies
here,
by
virtue
of
civil
rule
81
and
habeas
rule
11,
that
it's
error...
our
first
position
is
that
it's
error
to
override
the
forfeiture--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--except
in--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--yes.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
except
in
exceptional--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--circumstances.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
yes.
that's
correct.
and
then
our
second
fallback
position
is
that
even
if
your...
even
if
your
honors
agree
that
the
court
could...
has
discretion
to
override
the
express
waiver,
that
there's
at
least
a
discretionary
analysis
that
has
to
apply
under
civil
rule
15
that's
coupled
with
a
presumption
in...
against
sua
sponte
dismissal
that
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
apply
here.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
i...
they
normally
say
no,
that
that's--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--the...
because
the
case
has
gone
on
down
the
road
on
another
theory,
and
it's
prejudicial
to
the
parties,
and
it
wastes...
it's
a
waste
of
the
court's
judicial
resources
to--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--bring
it
up.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
well--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--well--
mr.
j.
brett
busby
--well,
we
disagree
that
this
was
up
front,
your
honor.
the
answer
in
a...
habeas
corpus
cases,
of
course,
heavily
deals
with
the
merits,
as
it
did
in
this
case.
and
then,
mr.
day
replied.
and,
as
the
state's
amicus
brief
points
out,
that's
all
that
usually
happens
in
most
habeas
corpus
cases.
so,
we
were
near
the
end
of
the
proceeding,
as...
if
you
think
of
the
run
of
the
mine
habeas
corpus
case.
and,
also,
speaking
of
run
of
the
mine
habeas
corpus
cases,
this
is
a
very
rare
instance.
there
are...
there
are
lots
of
procedures
for
courts
to
vindicate
the
interest
that
the
state
describes
in
comity,
finality,
and
federalism,
whether
inviting
a
motion
to...
whether
ordering
the
state
to
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
under
rule
4,
which
we
submit
would
be
the
proper
procedure,
or,
if
the
state
fails
to
raise
it
in
its
answer
in
certain
circumstances,
inviting
them
to
file
a
motion
to
amend
under
rule
15.
that
takes
care
of
these
interests
in
the
run
of
the
mine
case.
there's
no
need
to
vindicate
those
interests
in
this
case
by
creating
an
exception
to
the
rules.
this
court
has
said,
in
lonchar
and
in
carlisle,
that
where
there
are
civil
rules
that
deal
with
the...
and
habeas
rules...
that
deal
with
how
these
things
happen,
the
court
cannot
use
its
inherent
powers
to
circumvent
those
rules.
and
we
submit
that
that's
exactly
what
the
court
did
here.
now,
in
addition,
i'd
like
to
point
the
court
to
new
york
versus
hill,
which
is
not
cited
in
our
briefs,
but
can
be
found
at
528
u.s.
at
114
to
15
and
also
118,
on
this
express
waiver
issue.
and
this
is
a
case
where
the
court
recognized
exactly
the
point
that
we
make
here,
that
not
all...
you
don't
always
have
to
show
intentional
relinquishment
of
a
known
right
for
that
to
be
the
standard
for
waiver.
it
depends
on
the
right
at
issue.
there,
it
was
an
international
agreement
on
detainers
act
case,
and
the
court
held
that
the...
that
the
defendant's
assent
to
delay
waived
the
time
limitation
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
act,
expressly
waived
it.
and
that's
our...
that's
our
position
here,
is
that
the
state's
affirmative
pleading
of
timeliness
is
an
express
waiver.
in
addition,
the
state
could...
certainly
couldn't
prevail,
under
the
brady
versus
u.s.
standard
that
applies
to
plea
agreements,
for
saying
that
its
concession
was
not
knowing.
there's
no...
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
the
state
was
misled.
there's
no
suggestion
that
they
didn't
have
all
the
information
they
needed
to
make
the
calculation.
and
brady
says
that
simply
misapprehending
a
factor...
a
relevant
factor
in
the
analysis
is
not
enough.
and
that's
at
397
u.s.
at
page
757.
in
addition,
the
state
makes
an
argument
about
policies
beyond
the
concerns
of
the
parties,
and
that
the
state...
that
those
should
be
vindicated
in
this
case.
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
has
not
adopted
the
"beyond
the
concerns
of
the
parties.
"
test;
rather,
it's
acknowledged
that
congress
entrusts
even
important
public
policies,
like
comity,
finality,
and
federalism,
to
the
adversary
process;
and,
thus,
their...
and
even
private
rights
that
benefit
society
can
be
waived,
in
christiansburg
garment,
for
example.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
j.
brett
busby
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
"must"
versus
"may"
issue
that
counsel
discussed.
for
the
reasons
i
mentioned,
i
think
the
better
reading
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
is
that
there
was
an
obligation,
and
that
the
most
clear
indication
of
that
is
its
distinction
of
esslinger,
which
expressly
applied
a
granberry
type
analysis.
but,
even
if
the
court
believes
that
the
eleventh
circuit
was
only
saying
"may",
and
that
the
district
court
was
only
saying
"may",
and
recognized
the
that
it
had
discretion...
and
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
magistrate's
opinion
that
cites
to
jackson
that
says,
"we
have
discretion"...
i
would
submit
that
if
you
read
jackson,
it's
a
standardless
discretion.
there
are
no
factors
anywhere
in
jackson
of
the
type
that
this
court
discussed
in
granberry.
it...
and
there's
no
indication
that
the...
that
the
magistrate
judge
considered
any
of
those
factors.
there's
no
indication
that
the
eleventh
circuit
considered
any
of
those
factors.
and
it's
certainly
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
a
court
to
apply
the
wrong
legal
standard
or
fail
to
consider
the
relevant
factors
that
channel
that
discretion.
and
so,
we...
our
position
is
that,
because
the
factors
under
rule
15
and
the
other
factors
in
our
brief
were
not
applied,
that
a
remand,
at
a
minimum,
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
also,
i'd
like
to
speak
to
granberry
and
caspari.
again,
those
involve
exhaustion
and
nonretroactivity.
and
i
submit
that
it's
not
correct
to
characterize
those
two
doctrines
as
affirmative
defenses;
rather,
the
way
that
congress
codified
them
is
on...
as
substantive
limits
on
relief,
unlike
"limitations",
which
it
just
said
"period
of
limitations",
which
the
commonly
accepted
meaning
is
an
"affirmative
defense".
and
so,
that
makes
those
very
different
from
an
affirmative
defense,
in
terms
of
sua
sponte
consideration.
also,
both
"exhaustion"
and
"nonretroactivity"
are
unique
to
habeas.
they're
not
mentioned
anywhere
in
rules
8
and
12.
whereas,
"limitations",
of
course,
is
mentioned
explicitly.
and
so,
our
position
is
that
rule
8
and
12,
not
necessarily
always,
but
at
least
in
all
but
extraordinary
cases,
would
prevent
the
judge
from
raising
this
sua
sponte.
also,
i
would
say
that
the
rules
that
we
rely
on
don't
deprive
the
court
of
sua
sponte
authority,
they
channel
that
authority.
under
rule
4,
they
can
plead
it,
or
the
court
can
make
a
motion
to
dismiss...
ask
the...
order
the
state
to
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
limitations
under
habeas
rule
4.
they
can
plead
it
in
their
answer,
under
habeas
rule
5
and
civil
rules
8
and
12,
or
they
can
amend
their
answer,
under
civil
rule
15.
that's
the
way
the
drafters
of
the
rules
wanted
them
to
do
this.
and
lonchar
and
carlisle
say
they
cannot...
that
a
judge
cannot
use
his
sua
sponte
power
to
circumvent
the
requirements
of
those
rules.
finally,
i'd
like
to
mention
that
civil...
the
statutes
of
limitations
in
civil
cases
also
implicate
broader
social
interests.
and
some
of
them,
we've
discussed
in
our
brief.
and,
even
more
so,
because
there
are
lots
of
protections
in
aedpa
cases
that
don't
apply
in
civil
cases.
there
are
presumptions
of
correctness
and
those
sorts
of
things.
but
courts
in
civil
cases,
nonetheless,
say
that
statutes
of
limitations
can
be
waived.
and
the
result
should
be
no
different
here.
thank
you.
