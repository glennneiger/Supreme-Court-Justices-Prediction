chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
04-1324,
day
versus
mcdonough.
mr.
busby.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
the
other...
because
the
other
side
might
make
a
mistake
and
not
recognize
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
concern
present
in
granberry,
as
well?
and
yet,
the
court
reached
the
opposite
result
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
that
requires
the
court
to
raise
it
sua
sponte,
even
if
it's
not
raised
by
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
that
requires
the
court
to
raise
it
sua
sponte,
even
if
not
raised
by
the
state,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
wouldn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--be
an
abuse
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
wouldn't
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
him
to
suggest
an
amendment
if
he's
got
the
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
amendment
later
on.
and
then
presumably
the
ruling
would
be
reviewed
for
abuse
of
discretion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
why
doesn't
that
same
standard
apply
to
the
decision
of
the
court
to
raise
it
sua
sponte?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kise.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
it...
would
it
always
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
do
this
if
the
state
wanted
to
reach
the
merits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
no
question
of...
put
aside
a
sandbagging
case,
there's
no
question
of
sandbagging,
and
that
the...
the
state
just
wants
to
litigate
on
the
merits
rather
than
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
can
they
have
it...
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
an
express
waiver
case
as
opposed
to
a
forfeiture
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
doesn't
your
position
on
the
underlying
merits
of
the
timeliness
question
create
an
incentive
for
every
habeas
petitioner
to
file
a
cert
petition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
only
get
the
extra
90
days
if
you
actually
file,
under
your
explanation
for
why
this
cert
petition
is...
why
this
habeas
petition
is
untimely.
in
other
words,
if
this
individual
had
filed
a
cert
petition
with
us,
his
petition...
his
habeas
petition
would
be
timely.
and
he's
only
going
to
get
the
extra
period,
as
i
understand
your
position
on
the
timeliness,
if
he
files
a
cert
petition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
they
file
a
cert
petition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
doesn't
that
put
them
in
the
position
of
sometimes
having
to
file
that...
the
habeas
petition
while
the
cert
petition
is
still
pending,
if
they
file
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hallward
driemeier,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
with
respect
to
some--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--of
those,
of
course,
aedpa
specifically
promulgates
new
rules
about
when
they're
waived,
and
not.
and
they...
congress
hasn't
done
that
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
busby,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
in
04-1324,
day
v.
mcdonough.
