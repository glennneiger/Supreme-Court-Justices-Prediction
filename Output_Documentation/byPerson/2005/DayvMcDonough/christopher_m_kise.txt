mr.
christopher
m.
kise
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
district
court's
sua
sponte
action
here
was
consistent
with
aedpa
and
the
habeas
rules.
it
was
consistent
with
this
court's
habeas
jurisprudence.
and
it
was
consistent
with
the
purpose
behind,
and
not
prohibited
by,
federal
rules
8
and
12.
this
case
is
not
about
the
state's
waiver.
and
we
would
agree
that...
with
justice
scalia,
that
the
waiver
is
not
the
beginning
and
end
of
it.
we're
not
conceding
that
the
state,
in
fact,
waived
it
here,
but
we're
saying
that
that's
not
essential
to
the
answer
to
this
question,
because
it's
not
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
analysis.
this
case
is
also
not
about,
as
the
petitioner
alleges
in
the
brief
and
makes
inference
on
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion,
about
obligating
courts
to
act
in
all
circumstances.
this
case
is
about
the
proper
exercise
of
discretion.
and
what
we're
really
asking
this
court
to
do
is
really
three
things
to
acknowledge
again
that
this
authority
exists,
to
say
that
this
is
when
the
court
may
exercise
that
authority
under
the
circumstances
presented
by
this
case,
and
then,
thirdly,
that
this
is
how
the
court
goes
about
exercising
this
authority,
by
providing
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
conducting
an
analysis
of
prejudice.
and--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
your
honor,
respectfully,
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
the
eleventh
circuit
thought.
i
think
that
that
is
an
interpretation
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
language.
however,
i
think
that
where
the
phrase
that
counsel
pointed
to
in
the
opinion...
on
page
5(a),
referencing
4,
that
the
court
has
this
obligation.
i
think
it...
because
it's
in
that
discussion
that
the
court
is
talking
about
the
obligation.
and
i
would
submit
that,
indeed,
under
rule
4,
in
response,
i
believe,
to
justice...
a
point
justice
kennedy
raised,
i
would
say
that,
under
rule
4,
i
think
it
is
obligation.
i
think
what
rule
4
is,
is
a
reflection
of
congress...
excuse
me...
of
the
rule
advising
the
court
that,
"you
must
exercise
this
authority
that
you
already
have
at
this
particular
time.
"
"this
is
the
time
when
you
need
to
be
looking
for
these
things.
"
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
your
honor...
and
i
was
referring
to
that
sentence,
and
perhaps
i
wasn't
clear,
but
i
would...
i
would
say
that
they
are
still
talking
about
rule
4.
but
even
if
they're
not
talking
about
rule
4,
even
if,
in
fact,
this
court
believes
that
the
district...
that
the
circuit
court's
analysis
is
flawed,
then
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
this
court
is
reviewing
judgments,
not
opinions.
and
this
court
could
easily
do
what
it
did
in
gonzalez,
which
is,
even
though
the
analysis
is
not
consistent
with
what
this
court...
i
mean,
frankly,
if
the
court
takes
that
view
with
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
here...
but
you
can
nevertheless
affirm
the
judgment.
because
the
district
court
did,
in
fact,
get
it
right.
the--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--district
court--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--i
would
say,
respectfully,
your
honor,
that
that
is
somewhat
inconsistent,
if
not
entirely
inconsistent,
with
what
this
court
said
in
granberry
and
caspari,
dealing
with
the
same
sort
of
raising
of
affirmative
defenses.
from
that
standpoint,
from
a
procedural
standpoint,
i
would
say
that
granberry
and
caspari
are
procedurally
indistinct,
in
that
this
court
said
that
it
is
appropriate,
in
these
circumstances,
for
the
court
to
look
at
affirmative
defenses.
obviously,
they
have
substantive
differences,
which
my...
which
counsel
has
pointed
out,
but,
from
a
procedural
standpoint,
were
the
petitioner
to
prevail
here,
i
would
think
this
court
needs
to
recede
procedurally
from
granberry
and
caspari--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--because
the
court--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
state's
concession,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
is
not
the
beginning
and
end
of
it,
in
the
first
instance.
secondly,
it--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
and
we
would
agree
that
it
bears
on
the
exercise
of
discretion.
and,
in
a
circumstance
such
as
this
one,
where
the
attachments,
the
record
itself,
indicated
that
there
was
a
discrepancy
between
the
position
the
state
was
taking
and
what
the
record
actually
reflected,
it
was
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
raise
the
issue
and
then
consider
the
interests
of
the
parties.
if
the
district
court
had
been
presented
simply
with
nothing
in
the
record,
just
a
blanket
statement
by
the...
by
florida
that,
"we
concede",
and
there
was
nothing
to
raise
the
question,
then
we
would...
we
would
say
that
it's
not
appropriate
for
the
court
to
simply
pull
issues
out
of
the
sky.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
an
abuse.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
well,
justice--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--i
think
leaving
it
to
rule
15
is
one
way
to
do
it.
and
doing
it
in
these
particular
cases
is
another
way.
giving
the
courts
discretion
to
raise
the--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--respectfully,
your
honor,
i
believe
this
court's
already
done
that,
though,
in
granberry
and
caspari.
i
mean,
that's
what
you've
already
said,
is
that,
under...
that
habeas
is
different.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out,
we're
not
asking
for
a
different
construction
of
rules
8
and
12.
we're
asking
this
court
to
apply
the
same
exception
that
is
applied
in
the
extraordinary
case.
the
petitioner
takes
the
position...
and
petitioner
is
alone
in
this
contention...
that
"ordinarily"
means
"never".
even
the
law
professor
amici
don't
take
position,
and
there
is
not
a
case
that
we
have
been
able
to
locate
in
the
country
that
says
that
"ordinarily"
means
"never",
that--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--the
ordinary
rule--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--yes,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
it
is
"hardly
ever",
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
it's
what
the
court
was
dealing
with
in
granberry
and
caspari,
these
limited
circumstances
where
the
interests
transcend
the
interests
of
just
the
parties
before
the
court
and
where
it
is,
from
the...
from
a
review
of
the
record,
as
district
judges
do
every
day
looking
at
the
record
and
identifying
issues,
and
to
avoid
the
sort
of
conundrum
that's
presented
by
the
petitioner
agreeing
that
the
district
judge
could
simply
look
at
the
state
and,
as
justice
scalia
said,
wink,
wink,
"it's
okay
for
you
to
raise
this
issue
now.
"
to
avoid
the
roundabout
that
is
occasioned
by
that.
if
it
is,
in
fact,
permissible
in
these
circumstances
for
the
district
court
to
raise
the
issue,
then
doing
it
the
way
the
court
did
it
here,
and
the
way
that
was
approved
in
bendolph,
and
the
way
that
we
believe
the
eleventh
circuit
approved
it,
is
entirely
appropriate,
because
it's
consistent
with
what
this
court
said
in
its
habeas
jurisprudence.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
and
i
think
that's
why
it
is
set
up
the
way
it
is,
your
honor,
but
it's
just
that
the
waiver
is
not
the
beginning
and
end
of
it.
for
example,
where
the
state
might
wish
to
waive
the
statute
of
limitations
and
simply
move
to
the
merits
would
be
in
a
situation
where
there
might
be
some
complex
argument
over
equitable
tolling
and
where
the
merits
are
relatively
straightforward.
rather
than
spending
the
court's
time
and
the
resources
involved
and
litigating
over
equitable
tolling,
the
state
might
simply
say,
"we
realize
that
there
is
this
technicality
here,
but
we're
going
to
get
to
the
merits,
because
otherwise
we're
going
to
spend
an
inordinate
amount
of
time
litigating.
"
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
and,
your
honor,
our
test
allows
for
that,
as
well.
it's
up
to
the
district
court
to
decide
whether,
in
that
particular
case,
the
circumstances
require
the
application.
there
is
some
discretion.
i
don't
think
that
the
state
could--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
it
would
depend
on
why
the
state
wanted
to
reach
the
merits.
perhaps
the
state
was
engaging
in
some
sort
of
gaming
of
the
system,
as
petitioner
alleges
could
happen.
if
there
was,
in
fact,
some
actual
sandbagging
going
on,
where
the
state
is
holding
this
issue
in
reserve
as
a
strategic
matter,
and
the
district
court
simply
says,
"no,
we're
not
going
to
allow
that.
"
and
it
would
really
be
the
same
analysis
under
rule
15.
if
the
court
were
to
have
sandbagged,
so
to
speak,
under
rule
15
and
waited
to
file
a
late
amendment,
the
court
would
engage
in
the
same
analysis.
the
court
would
say,
"well,
wait,
do
i
really
want
to
permit
the
state,
now,
to
assert
this?
"
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
it
would
not
always
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
i--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--i
don't
think
that
you
could
say,
in
all
circumstances...
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
all
circumstances.
but
i
do
think
the
district
court
needs
to
factor
in
the
interests
of
the
state
and
the
reasons
why
the
state
is
willing
to
proceed
forward.
and
if
the
state,
for
example,
is,
as
i
believe
an
example
was
given
by
the
court,
that
the
state
is...
believes
that,
"well,
perhaps
it's
appropriate
to
waive
the
statute
here,
or
to
not
rely
on
the
statute
here,
because
of
something
maybe
we
have
done,
or
that
it...
the
petitioner
didn't...
missed
the
deadline
by
a
certain
period
of
time,
and
we
think
that,
in
this
particular
case,
it's
all
right
to
reach
those
merits.
"
so,
i
can't...
i
don't
think
we
should
say
that
it's
always
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
i
think
we
need
to
leave
it
to
district
courts
to
make
that
determination,
just
as
this
court
did
in
granberry
and
caspari.
this
court
gave
district
courts
that
discretion,
because
these
are
the
types
of
cases
where
that
discretion
is
appropriate.
this
court's
already
identified
that,
in
habeas
cases,
we
are
to
treat
rules
8
and
12
as
the
exception
being
applied,
that
these--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
your
honor,
in
fact,
this
court
did
give
the
court
of
appeals
that
discretion,
but
even
more
so
than
we
would
give
the
district
court
that
discretion,
because,
why
should
we
wait
for
the
process
to
get
all
the
way
to
the
court
of
appeals?
if
this
court
is
going
to
say
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
look
at
an
affirmative
defense,
then
certainly,
in
keeping
with
that
reasoning,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
district
court
to
raise
it
before
we've
gone
through
the
entire
process
of
litigation
in
the
district
court
and
then
getting
ourselves
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not,
and
i'll
tell
you
why
i
would
not.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
it's
because,
just
as
in
gonzalez,
the
court
is
not
reviewing
the
opinion.
the
court
is
reviewing
the
judgment.
and
the--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--judgment
is
correct.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i
would
agree
that
the
court
thought
it
was
deciding
discretion,
but
i
was
responding,
i...
to
what
i
thought
was
justice
scalia's
question
about,
what
if
this
court
does
not
agree
with
that?
if
this
court
believes
that
the
eleventh
circuit,
in
fact,
was
applying
an
obligation
rule,
a
mandatory
rule,
then
it
would
require
remand.
and
i...
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is...
is
that
we
would
not,
because
the
district
court
applied
the
appropriate
test.
in
the
first
instance,
i
would
say
that
the
eleventh
circuit
did
not,
in
fact,
apply
that
test,
did
not
believe
that
it
was
obligated
to,
but
if
this
court
were
to
disagree,
as
justice
scalia
has
presented
the
hypothetical,
then
i
would
say
that
the
district
court
did,
in
fact,
apply
the
correct
test.
the
district
court,
as
noted
in...
on
page
8(a)
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
footnote
in
the
magistrate's
report
and
recommendation
cites
jackson,
the
eleventh
circuit
case
which
stands
for
the
discretionary
proposition,
and
indicates
specifically
that
it
is
relying
on
a
discretionary
test.
and
so,
the
district
court
in
this
case,
in
fact,
applied
the
test
that
we
are
advocating,
and
in...
and,
frankly,
got
it
right.
the
district
court
applied
discretion,
raised
the
issue,
provided
a
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
conducted
the
analysis
of
prejudice...
there
was
no
prejudice
in
this
case...
and
ruled,
on
that
basis.
and
that
ruling
was
consistent
with
this
court's
habeas
jurisprudence,
and
it
was
consistent
with
aedpa
and
with
the
habeas
rules.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i
understand
our
position
to
be
that
they
do
not
get
the
90
days,
postconviction.
and
if
that
is
misstated
in
our
brief...
but
i...
certainly
we're
not
attempting
to
encourage
the
filing
of
cert
petitions
by
habeas
petitioners.
and
we
believe
the
statute
provides
for
the
90
days,
postdirect
review,
but
not
after
following
state
postconviction.
once
the
state
postconviction
proceedings
are
no
longer
pending,
meaning
that
they
are
completed
for
state
purposes,
not
including
the
90
days--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--that's
when
they
terminate.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
yes,
your
honor,
it
might.
it
does
present
that
conundrum.
but
that's
what
the
statute
provides.
that
is
the
way
the
statute
has
provided
for
it.
and
we
think
that
interpretation
is
consistent,
because
there
certainly...
as
was
referenced
in
the
first
oral
argument,
there
is
some
expectation
that
the
court
might
grant
certiorari,
but
it's
not
in
the...
the
likely
case.
and
so,
to
suspend
the
congressional
purpose
of
moving
these
cases
through
the
system
on
the
chance
that
the
one
in
a
thousand,
or
perhaps
more
than
one
in
a
thousand,
case
is
granted
certiorari
would
not
be
an
appropriate
process
to
utilize.
and
i
think
the
circuit
courts
bear
that
out.
the
opinions
of
all
but
one
of
the
circuits
bear
that...
bear
that--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--your
honor,
one
circuit...
ten
of
the
circuits
go
in
the
direction
that
we
advocate,
and
abela,
the
sixth
circuit
case
that
is
cited,
i
believe,
by
the
petitioner--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--moves
in
the
other
direction.
and
it
is
only
recently
that
they
have
done
that.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
