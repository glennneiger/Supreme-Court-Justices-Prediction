justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
it
might
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
you'd
already
had
a
hearing
and
took...
and
decided
that
there
was
merit
to
the
plaintiff's
claim,
and
then
decided,
"well,
now
i'm
going
to
just
throw
it
out
on
limitations.
"
might
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
conflict
on
the
circuits
on
that
point?
i
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
