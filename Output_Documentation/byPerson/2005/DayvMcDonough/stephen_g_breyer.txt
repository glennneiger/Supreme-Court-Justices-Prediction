justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
position
is,
it
should
be
like
any
other
civil
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
raise
it
sua
sponte,
we've
said,
in
exceptional
circumstances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
what
they
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they're
not
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
the
judge
could
say,
"you
know,
i'm
surprised
that
you
haven't
raised
statute
of
limitations.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
lawyer
for
the
state
says,
"oh,
my
goodness.
"
"quite
right.
"
"we'd
like
to
amend.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
to
decide--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why,
just
out
of
curiosity...
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
actual
practice
of
a
lot
of
civil
cases,
but
when
somebody...
let's
say
the
defendant
in
an
ordinary
tort
case
forgets
to
put
in
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
the
case
is
all
tried
and
finished.
at
the
very
end,
he
says,
"oh,
my
god".
and
now
he
goes
in
and
asks
to
amend
it
under
rule
15.
do
judges
normally
say,
"fine"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
district
judges
can't
comment
on
the
cases?
and...
they
suddenly
raise
something,
curious
about
something;
and,
lo
and
behold,
it
becomes
the
subject
of
an
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
violation
of...
i
mean,
what
i'm
driving
at
is,
i
don't
really
understand
rule
15
thoroughly,
because
i'm
not
a
trial
lawyer.
and
why
do
we
have
to
decide
every
matter?
why
don't
we
let
the
district
judge
free
to
run
his
trial
and
just
say,
"hey,
we
don't
want
to
proliferate
law.
"
"it's
complicated
enough
already.
"
"let's
leave
it
to
rule
15,
whatever
that
might
be?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
the
other
way
means
we're
now
going
to
have
a
new
area
of
law.
the
new
area
of
law
consists
of
habeas
law
involving
what
is
the
equivalent
of
an
amendment
suggested
by
the
judge
to
bring
up
a
statute.
that
would
be
good,
because
west
would
then
have
five
more
pages,
with
a
new
keynote--
[laughter]
--and
there
would
be
more
for
lawyers
to
look
up.
whereas,
if
you
just
say
rule
15,
it's
finished.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
though,
would
we
have
a
special
rule
in
this
respect
for
habeas
cases?
same
question
i've
had
throughout.
treat
it
like
any
other
civil
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
if
it's
not
a
special
rule,
then
the
answer
to
this
is,
just
say,
"no,
you
don't
have
to
raise
it
sua
sponte.
"
"moreover,
you
cannot
raise
it
sua
sponte,
except
in
exceptional
circumstances.
"
cite
the
three
cases
that
said
that.
and,
as
far
as
you're
suggesting
it
to
people,
you
could
do
it
just
as
much
as
you
do
in
any
other
civil
case,
no
special
rule.
if
they
want
to
move
to
amend,
fine,
end
of
case,
we
did
it
in
a
paragraph.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
same
with
strike
suits.
you
know,
there
are
a
lot
of
class
action
strike
suits
and
so
forth
that
at
least
one
group
of
people
think
are
terrible
and
the
other
group
think
are
great.
so,
you
say,
"well,
we're
going
to
have
a
special
thing
here
for
amendments
in
strike
suits.
"
"have
a
special
amendment
for
some.
"
--you
know,
why
proliferate
law?
