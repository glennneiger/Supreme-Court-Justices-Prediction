are
you--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--are
you
saying
that
the
error
is
simply
that
it
wasn't
done
via
rule
15?
what
if
we
were
to
say
that
the
same
considerations
apply
when
it's
simply
raised
sua
sponte
by
the...
by
the...
by
the
district
court?
what
would
be
your
objection
to
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you
think
it's...
if
it's
done
under
rule
15,
would
the
considerations
necessarily
be
exactly
the
same
in
a
habeas
case
as
in
an
ordinary
civil
case?
