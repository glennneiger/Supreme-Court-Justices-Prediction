mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
there
is
nothing
in
either
the
habeas
rules
or
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
deprives
the
district
court
of
its
authority
sua
sponte
to
recognize
the
untimeliness
of
a
habeas
petition.
to
the
contrary,
to
the
extent
the
rules
speak
to
the
issue
at
all,
they
confirm
that
in
light
of
the
significant
social
cost
of
federal
review
of
state
court
convictions,
the
federal
courts
have
a
unique
responsibility
to
weed
out
unmeritorious
claims
and
to
enforce
the
limitations
on
habeas
review.
rule
4
imposes
an
obligation
on
the
court
to
dismiss
unmeritorious
petitions
without
even
calling
for
an
answer
by
the
state.
now,
rule
4
is
not
applicable
here,
but
the
absence
of
an
obligation
to
note
the
deficiency
sua
sponte
does
not
connote
a
prohibition
on
acting
sua
sponte;
rather,
it
suggests
that
it
lies
in
the
court's
discretion.
that
is
exactly
how
this
court
addressed
similar
question
in
granberry,
where
it
rejected
the
two
extremes...
one,
recognizing
the
limitation
as
jurisdictional,
that
the
court
was
obligated
to
raise
it
sua
sponte,
but
also
rejecting
the
opposite
extreme,
that
the
court
was
prohibited
to
address
an
issue
that
had
not
been
preserved
in
the
district
court.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it's
not
really
a
special
rule
that
we're
advocating.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
the
relevant
analogy
in
the
civil
context
is
not
to
what
a
court
would
do
with
a
statute
of
limitations
defense
in
the
civil
context,
it
is
to
what
would
the
court
do
with
respect
to
an
affirmative
defense
that,
like
the
habeas
limitations,
implicates
broader
social
interests?
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
the
court
recognized...
arizona
v.
california
is
an
example
of
the
broader
social
interests
that
are
implicated
by
the
affirmative
defense
of
res
judicata.
and
the
court
noted,
in
arizona
versus
california,
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
raise
that
defense
sua
sponte.
and,
of
course,
plaut
versus
spendthrift
farm
says
the
same
thing.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
our
point
is
that
it
is
a
matter
for
the
court's
discretion.
and
there
may
well
be
circumstances
where
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
interject
a
timeliness
objection.
for
example,
if
the
case
had
gone
on
for
years,
and
a
trial
had
been
held,
as
your
honor
suggested
in
the
question
earlier,
that
might
well
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
it
would
not...
for
example,
take
the
case
where
the
district
court
had
dismissed,
at
the
outset,
on
the
merits,
and
it
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"you
know,
that
merits
issue
is
a
very
difficult
one.
"
"and,
in
fact,
we
think
we
might
have
to
remand
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
that
issue.
"
"but,
you
know,
this
case
was
untimely
filed.
"
"we
can
dispose
of
it
on
that
basis.
"
"and
we
can
save
all
of
those
judicial
and
party
resources
by
addressing
that
issue
now.
"
we
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
court's
discretion.
here,
as
your
honor
noted
earlier,
this
was
the
first
thing
that
happened
in
the
district
court
after
the
filing
of
the
petition,
the
answer,
and
the
reply.
there
was
no
waste
of
judicial
resources
by
the
fact
that
it
was
raised
sua
sponte
by
the
court
in
the
first
thing
that
the
court
did
after
that
briefing.
there
was
no
prejudice
to
the
petitioner,
because
it
was
omitted
from
the
state's
responsive
pleading.
there
is...
as
the
court
said
in
granberry,
the
failure
to
plead
it
perhaps
waives
the
district...
the
state's
opportunity
to
insist
on
the
defense.
the
state,
because
it
said,
in
its
answer
here,
erroneously,
that
the
petition
was
timely
filed,
or
if
it
had
said
nothing,
would
have
waived
its
opportunity
to
stand
on,
and
insist
on,
that
defense.
but
it
is
not
an
absolute
forfeiture.
it
does
not
bar
the
party
from
suggesting
at
a
later
time,
"we
would
like
to
amend",
or,
in
this
case,
the
court
to
note
it
sua
sponte.
the
court
did,
here,
of
course,
give
the
petitioner
every
opportunity--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--we
believe
that
the
court
is
not
absolutely
limited
by
the
defenses--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--asserted
by--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--yes.
yes.
the
court
is
not
absolutely
limited
by
the
affirmative
defenses
asserted
by
the
state.
for...
and
that
is
perhaps
most
easily
seen
with
respect
to
affirmative
defenses
such
as
failure
to
exhaust,
nonretroactivity.
if
the
court
was
going
to
have
to
assess
a
brand
new
constitutional
claim
that
the
habeas
petitioner--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--was
asserting--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
right.
and
obviously,
as
the
state
suggested,
if
the
state
didn't
want
to
stand
on
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
because,
for
example,
it
was
particularly
messy,
there
was
going
to
be
a
lot
of
litigation
about
equitable
tolling,
it
would
in
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
insist
on
litigating
that
issue.
but
if,
for
example,
the
state
said,
"well,
you
know,
if
we
didn't
stand
on
this
defense,
instead
this
petitioner
would
go
back
to
the
state
court,
and
the
state's
courts
are
going
to
be
very
hospitable
to
this
claim.
"
"we
think
you're
more
likely
to
deny
relief,
so
we'd
rather
have
it
litigated
here.
"
it
would
inappropriate
for
the
state
to
try
to
force
the
federal
court
to
litigate
that
issue
instead
of
the
state
court.
these
are
all
fact
specific,
case
specific
considerations.
and
that's
what
the
court
did
in
granberry.
it
remanded...
after
setting
aside
both
extreme
positions,
it
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
case
specific
application
of
discretion.
as
to
the
question
of
whether
the
eleventh
circuit
here
believed
that
there
was
an
absolute
obligation,
i
think
that
it's
relevant
to
note
that,
although
there
was
one
point
at
which
it
said,
"the
court
was
obligated
to
enforce
the
statute
of
limitations.
"
--and,
of
course,
that's
true
if
the
state
has
preserved
the
defense...
there
were
three
other
points
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
where
it
used
discretionary
or
nonmandatory
language.
for
example,
at
petition
appendix
4(a),
the
court
said
that
the
district
court
"may
dismiss".
at
the
petition
appendix
5(a),
it
said
that
the
state's
failure
to
raise
"does
not
bar"
the
court
from
acting
sua
sponte.
again,
at
petition
appendix
6(a),
the
state's
concession,
quote,
"does
not
compromise
the
authority
of
the
district
court.
"
all
of
those
are
phrased
in
more
permissive
language--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
perhaps
the...
perhaps
the
even
most
clear
indication
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
this
is
its
citation
to
jackson
as
an
application
of
jackson.
and
in
jackson
there
is
no
question,
because
jackson
said,
quote,
"the
district
court
possessed
the
discretion
to
raise
sua
sponte.
"
and
the...
and
the
magistrate
judge,
as
the
state's
counsel,
mentioned...
in
footnote
1
of
its
opinion,
cites
that
same
standard
and
makes
clear
that
it's
raising
this
at
a...
as
a
matter
of
its
discretion.
so,
remand
for
the
exercise
of
discretion
would
be...
serve
no
purpose
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
