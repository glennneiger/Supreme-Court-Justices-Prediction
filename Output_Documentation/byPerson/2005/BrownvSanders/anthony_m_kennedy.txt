well,
i
suppose
the
reason
behind
this
distinction...
and
it's,
in
a
sense,
artificial,
because
we
made
it
up...
i
suppose
the
reason
is
that,
in
the
"weighing"
state,
the
concern
is
that
if
there
is
an
ineligible...
or
an
invalid
factor
in
the
eligibility
determination,
it
carries
over
with
the
degree
of
force
and
weight...
it's
almost...
it's
a
presumption
that
the
jury
is
liable
to
treat
it...
or,
at
least
the
jury
is
liable
to
treat
it
as
such.
and
i
see
that
same
aspect
to
this
case,
when
the
instructions
refers...
you
indicated
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
souter
that
the
instructions
specifically
say
"any
special...
any
special
circumstance
which
has
been
found.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
am
i
right
that
the
special--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
have
one
background
question.
and
maybe
i
missed
something.
number
14,
"where
it
was
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
--taken
alone,
that
would
be
vague.
but
i
thought
that
in
profitt
we
said
that
if
it
were...
if
there
were
a
gloss
given
by
the
courts
in
interpreting
that
standard
so
that
it
was
made
more
specific,
evidenced
in
a
pitiless
attitude,
pitiless
crime,
that
then
it
was
valid.
has
a
federal
court,
or
have
we
said,
that
this
provision
is
unconstitutional?
or
do
we
just
assume
that
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
am
i
missing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
invalid
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
now
we
have
an
extra
layer
of
complexity,
because
something
that's
been
held
unconstitutional
under
state
law
is
said
to
skew
the
weighing,
if
it
is
weighing,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
it
this
case
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
california
made
the
definitive
interpretation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
this
is...
what
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--engert.
i
can
find
it,
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
this
goes
to
a
question,
really,
for
the
respondent.
it
helps...
there
is
a
paradox
here.
to
the
extent
that
a
state
attempts
to
guide
and
to
limit
what
the
jury
can
consider
in
the
selection
phase,
it's
held
to
a
higher
standard.
there
is...
there
is
certainly
a
paradox
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maybe--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so,
in
this...
or,
weren't
there
previous
california
cases...
or,
again,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
where
california
says
the
reasonable
possibility
test
requires
the
defendant
to
establish
that
the
error
was
prejudicial?
i
thought
that
was
the
california
law.
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
not...
it's
prefaced
by
circumstances
of
the
crime.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
state,
and
other
states,
can
determine,
"oh,
the
victim
was
in
fear
for
a
long
time,
or
was
tortured.
"
it
seems
very
odd
that
a
state,
which
is
a
so
called
"nonweighing"
state,
could
allow
all
of
this
same
evidence
to
come
in,
but
california,
which
tries
to
get
some
structure,
is
suddenly
held
to
a
higher
standard.
that's
paradoxical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
it's...
it's
invalid
only
because
it's
too
vague
for
eligibility.
it's
not
invalid
because
it's
too
vague
for
selection.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you...
do
you
defend
that
the
difference
in...
our
distinction
between
balancing
and
nonbalancing...
or,
pardon
me,
"weighing"
and
"nonweighing"
states...
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
indicates
the...
that
you
would
not
be
disconsolate
if
we
jettisoned
the
whole...
the
whole
distinction.
and
isn't
it
true
that
it's
paradoxical
that
a
state
which
tries
to
structure
the
selection
phase
by
giving
specific
factors
as
held
to
a
higher
standard
than
a
state
that
doesn't?
that
seems
to
me
very
odd.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
is
within
the
contours
of
the
constitution
if,
in
a
"nonweighing"
state,
the
same
evidence
could
be
considered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--analysis,
would
you
use,
as
one
factor,
the
circumstance
that
an
eligibility
determination
was
made
by
the
jury,
was
focused
on
by
the
prosecutor,
and
that
that
was
impermissibly
vague?
would
that
be
a
component
of
your
harmless
error
analysis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
we
have
the
rule,
already,
that
if
there
is
an
invalid
eligibility
factor
and
it's
a
"weighing"
state,
that
there's...
that
the
process
is
defective.
would
you
carry
over
that
same
argument
just
as
one
component
of
the
harmless
error
analysis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
the
whole
basis...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
for
the
ninth
circuit's
case
in
your...
ninth
circuit
decision
in
your
favor
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
it
certainly--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
an
accurate
description
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
the
rule
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
was
just
asking
if
we
can
import
the
same
formal
rule
we
now
have
and
reach...
and...
if
we
don't
consider
the
same
things
in
harmless
error
analysis.
