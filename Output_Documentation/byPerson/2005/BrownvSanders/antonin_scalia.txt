it
is,
indeed,
very
complicated,
ms.
kirkland.
and,
i
forget,
which
provision
of
the
constitution
is
it
that
contains
this
complexity?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
the
eighth
amendment
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
are
forbidden.
and
this
is
where
that
comes
from.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did...
what
did
the
california
supreme
court
hold?
did
it
hold
that
considering
the
"heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel.
"
nature
of
the
crime
as
part
of
the
totality
of
the
balancing
was
improper,
or
did
it
hold
that
that
language
is
insufficient
to
form
one
of
the
narrowing
functions
that
the
aggravating
circumstances--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
if
i
think
something
is
"heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel.
"
i
can
use
that
in
the
balancing,
even
though
i
can't
use
it
as
one
of
the
narrowing
factors.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
rivkind,
i
really
don't
understand
what
harm
is
done
here.
i
can
understand
you're
saying
that
there
is
harm
done
when
a
statute
says,
"the
jury
shall
weigh
the
aggravating
circumstances.
"
which
are...
have
been
specified
and
which
are
narrowing
circumstances;
there
are
only
five
named
in
the
statute...
"shall
weigh
the
aggravating
circumstances
found
to
be
true
against
the
mitigating.
"
and
it
turns
out
that
one
of
those
five
aggravating
circumstances
is
unconstitutional.
okay?
then
you
have
the
jury
weighing
something
that
it
shouldn't
have
weighed,
because
that
aggravating
circumstance
was
bad.
i
don't
see
why
any
harm
is
done
where
you
have
a
statute
that
lists
aggravating
factors,
one
of
which
is
"heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel.
"
and
that
is
later
found
invalid
by
the
state
supreme
court.
but
then,
in
the
weighing
process,
the
jury
is
told,
"don't
just
weigh
aggravating
factors,
weigh
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
"
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
jury
that
erroneously
found,
as
one
of
the
aggravating
factors,
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
would
also
have
found
that
"heinousness,
atrociousness,
and
cruelty.
"
to
be
one
of
the
circumstances
to
be
weighed.
so,
what
harm
is
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
so.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming--
justice
antonin
scalia
--assuming
the
district
court
does
the...
the
district
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
does
the
harmless
error
analysis
correctly.
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
never
heard
that
described
as
a
mitigating
factor
before.
i
mean,
it's
certainly
worse
if
you're
a
triggerman,
but
i
don't
know
what
makes
it...
somehow
it's
mitigating
if
you
were
not
the
triggerman.
i
would
say
that
you're
not
guilty
of
something
even
worse.
but
to
call
that
a
factor
of
mitigation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
wants
to
know
whether
you
would
like
to
be
thrown--
justice
antonin
scalia
--into
the
"breyer"
patch.
i
think--
[laughter]
--i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
same
jury.
the
same
jury
that
found
it
atrocious
and
cruel
in
the
guilt
phase
would
find
it
atrocious
and
cruel
in
the
weighing
stage.
i
don't
see--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
what...
the
specificity
you
need
for
the
narrowing
factor
does
not
exist
with
respect
to
mitigating
factors.
we've
said
anything
can
be
a
mitigating
factor.
i
find
it
impossible
to
believe
that
the
california
supreme
court
said
not
only
is
the
phrase
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
too...
you
know,
too
vague
for
the
narrowing
factor,
but,
when
you
get
to
the
weighing
phase,
the
fact
that
the
murderer
sliced
up
his
victim
with
a
thousand
cuts
of
the
knife
cannot
be
taken
into
account
by
the
jury.
that's
unbelievable.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
statute
does
not
say
"the
finding
of
any
special
circumstances
found
to
be
true.
"
it
says
"the
existence
of
any
special
circumstances
found
to
be
true.
"
that's
what
they're...
that's
what
they're
instructed
to
consider.
the
existence.
in
determining
the
penalty,
the
trier
of
fact
take
into
account
the
following,
(a),
it
says,
the
"existence"
of
any
special
circumstances
found
to
be
true;
not
the
"fact"
that
they
were
found
to
be
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
9th
circuit.
the
respondent,
sanders,
was
convicted
of
various
crimes,
including
first-degree
murder.
his
jury
found
four
eligibility
factors
under
california
law,
each
of
which
independently
made
him
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
the
trial
then
moved
to
a
penalty
phase,
at
which
the
jury
was
instructed
to
consider
a
list
of
sentencing
factors,
including
one
which
was
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
of
which
the
defendant
was
convicted
in
the
present
proceedings
and
the
existence
of
any
eligibility
factors.
the
jury
sentenced
sanders
to
death.
on
direct
appeal,
the
california
supreme
court
invalidated
two
of
the
eligibility
factors,
but
nonetheless
affirmed
sanders’
conviction
and
sentence.
sanders
sought
habeas
relief
in
federal
district
court,
arguing
as
relevant
here
that
the
jury’s
consideration
of
invalid
eligibility
factors
rendered
his
death
sentence
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
denied
relief,
but
the
9th
circuit
reversed.
the
9th
circuit
held
that
california
is
what
our
opinions
have
called
a
“weighing
state”
and,
applying
the
rules
we
have
announced
for
such
states,
concluded
that
california
courts
could
uphold
sanders’
death
sentence
only
by
finding
the
jury’s
use
of
the
invalid
eligibility
factors
to
have
been
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
by
independently
reweighing
the
sentencing
factors.
since,
the
9th
circuit
continued,
the
state
courts
had
done
neither
of
these
things,
the
death
sentence
was
unconstitutional.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
9th
circuit.
our
cases
require
states
to
limit
the
class
of
murderers
to
which
the
death
penalty
may
be
applied.
but
this
narrowing
of
the
category
is
usually
accomplished
when
the
trier
of
fact
finds
at
least
one
statutorily
defined
eligibility
factor;
for
example,
the
murder
was
a
multiple
murder,
or
it
involved
torture
of
the
victim.
this
eligibility
factor
can
be
found
at
either
the
guilt
or
the
penalty
phase.
once
the
narrowing
requirement
has
been
satisfied,
however,
the
sentencer
is
then
called
upon
to
determine
whether
a
defendant
thus
found
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
should,
in
fact,
receive
it.
most
states
channel
this
latter
function
by
specifying
the
aggravating
factors
that
are
to
be
weighed
against
mitigating
considerations.
in
some
states,
the
aggravating
factors
are
identical
to
the
eligibility
factors.
the
question
we
confront
in
this
case
is
what
happens
when
the
sentencer
imposes
the
death
penalty
after
finding
eligibility
factors,
one
or
more
of
which,
but
less
than
all
of
which,
is
later
held
to
be
invalid.
to
answer
that
question,
we
have
in
the
past
set
forth
different
rules
for
so-called
“weighing”
and
“non-weighing
states”.
we
identified
as
weighing
states
those
in
which
the
only
aggravating
factors
permitted
to
be
considered
by
the
sentencer
were
the
specified
eligibility
factors.
since
the
eligibility
factors
by
definition
identify
distinct
and
particular
aggravating
features,
if
one
of
them
was
invalid,
the
jury
could
not
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
relative
to
that
factor
as
aggravating
in
some
other
capacity
under
some
other
ruling;
that
is,
the
sentencers’
consideration
of
an
invalid
eligibility
factor
necessarily
skewed
its
balancing
of
aggravators
with
mitigators
and
so
required
reversal
of
the
sentence.
by
contrast,
in
a
non-weighing
state,
a
state
that
permitted
the
sentencer
to
consider
aggravating
factors
different
from
or
in
addition
to
the
eligibility
factors,
this
automatic
skewing
would
not
necessarily
occur.
it
would
never
occur
if
the
aggravating
factors
were
entirely
different
from
the
eligibility
factors,
nor
would
it
occur
if
the
aggravating
factors
added
to
the
eligibility
factors
a
category
that
would
allow
the
very
facts
and
circumstances
relative
to
the
invalidated
eligibility
factor
to
be
weighed
in
aggravation
under
a
different
rubric,
such
as
under
the
rubric
that
existed
here
of
all
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
this
weighing/non-weighing
scheme
is
accurate
as
far
as
it
goes.
but
it
now
seems
to
us
needlessly
complex
and
incapable
of
providing
for
the
full
range
of
possible
variations;
for
example,
the
same
problem
that
gave
rise
to
our
weighing-state
jurisprudence
would
arise
if
it
were
a
sentencing
factor
and
rather
than
an
eligibility
factor
that
was
later
found
to
be
invalid.
the
weighing
process
would
just
as
clearly
have
been
prima
facie
skewed,
and
skewed
for
the
same
basic
reason.
the
sentencer
might
have
given
weight
to
a
statutorily
or
constitutionally
invalid
aggravator.
and
the
prima
facie
skewing
could,
in
appropriate
cases,
be
shown
to
be
illusory
for
the
same
reason
that
separates
weighing
states
from
non-weighing
states;
that
is,
one
of
the
other
aggravating
factors
made
it
entirely
proper
for
the
jury
to
consider
as
aggravating
the
facts
and
circumstances
underlying
the
invalidated
factor.
are
you
with
me
up
to
now?
we
think
it
will
clarify
the
analysis
if
we
are
henceforth
guided
by
the
following
rule:
an
invalidated
sentencing
factor,
whether
it
is
an
eligibility
factor
or
not,
will
render
the
sentence
unconstitutional
by
reason
of
its
adding
an
improper
element
to
the
aggravation
scale
in
the
weighing
process
unless
one
of
the
other
sentencing
factors
enables
the
sentencer
to
give
aggravating
weight
to
the
same
facts
and
circumstances.
turning
now
to
this
case,
in
california,
if
the
jury
finds
the
existence
of
one
of
the
eligibility
factors,
it
is
instructed
to
consider
a
separate
list
of
sentencing
factors,
which
include,
as
i
have
said,
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
of
which
the
defendant
was
convicted.
this
circumstances-of-the-crime
factor
has
the
effect
of
rendering
all
the
specified
factors
nonexclusive,
thus
causing
california
to
be
what
we
used
to
call
a
non-weighing
state.
but
leaving
aside
the
weighing/non-weighing
dichotomy
--
and
of
course,
the
9th
circuit
held
the
opposite,
that
it
was
a
weighing
state
--
but
leaving
aside
the
weighing/non-weighing
dichotomy,
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
admissible
to
establish
the
invalidated
eligibility
factors
were
also
properly
adduced
as
aggravating
factors
bearing
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
crime-sentencing
factor.
they
were
properly
considered,
whether
or
not
they
bore
upon
the
invalidated
factor.
as
a
result,
the
jury’s
consideration
of
those
invalid
eligibility
factors
in
the
weighing
process
gave
rise
to
no
constitutional
violation,
and
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
erred
in
ordering
habeas
relief.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
9th
circuit
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
