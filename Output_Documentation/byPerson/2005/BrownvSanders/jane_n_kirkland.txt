ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
whether
a
capital
sentencing
statute
is
categorized
as
"weighing"
or
"nonweighing"
determines
how
courts
assess
the
impact
of
an
invalid
death
eligibility
factor
on
a
jury's
sentence
selection.
to
decide
whether
a
statute
is
"weighing"
or
"nonweighing",
we
look
to
the
function,
if
any,
of
an
eligibility
factor
in
the
statute's
sentence
selection
process.
in
a
"weighing"
scheme,
as
this
court
first
stated
in
zant,
a
jury
is
specifically
instructed
to
weigh
the
statutory
eligibility
factors,
along
with
any
mitigation,
to
choose
the
sentence.
in
a
"nonweighing"
scheme,
the
eligibility
factors
have
no
role
above
the
role
of
"all
other
sentencing
evidence".
california
is
a
"nonweighing"
state,
for
two
primary
reasons.
first,
the
only
reference
whatsoever
to
11
open
ended
sentencing
factors
is
in
its
sentencing
factor
(a),
but
that
reference
has
no
significance,
because,
under
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
holdings
of
the
california
supreme
court,
factor
(a)
means
the
jury
is
to
consider,
if
it's
relevant,
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
offenses,
including
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
underlie
the
eligibility
factors.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
they're
instructed
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
in
that
sentencing
factor
(a),
there
is
a
reference
to
those
special
circumstances.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
so
that--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--correct.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
but
it's
not
reasonably
likely
that
the
jury
would
have
understood
that
to
mean
that
they
should
accord
any
special
weight
to
the
title
of
special
circumstances,
apart
from
the
overall
umbrella
of
the--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--special
circumstances
that--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--well,
in
"weighing"
states,
the
eligibility
factors
form
the
primary
aggravation
for
the
jury
to
consider
at
sentencing.
in
california,
the
reference
to
the
eligibility
factors
is
that
one
subpart
of
one
of
otherwise
completely
distinguished
from
eligibility
factors--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--sentencing
factors--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--there's
two
differences
between
that.
in
any
of
those
"weighing"
states...
well,
in
mississippi
and
florida,
for
example...
the
eligibility
or
aggravating
factors
are...
are
the
sole
aggravation
at
sentencing,
and--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--that
through--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--well,
they
couldn't
at
the
time
of
clemons
and
stringer.
apparently,
in
the
interim,
in
the
1990s,
as
is
discussed
in
our
brief,
they...
mississippi
changed
the
interpretation
of
its
statute,
so
it
now
has,
sort
of,
an
overarching
circumstances
of
the
crime
aggravation
consideration
in
its
sentencing.
but
that
was
not
the
time
as
of
clemons.
and,
in
the
footnote
in
clemons,
which...
this
court
referred
to
the
statute
of
mississippi...
it
was
clear
that,
at
least
at
the
time
of
clemons,
the
eligibility
factors
were
the
sole
aggravation.
but
the--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--it
depends
how
else
the
aggravating
factors
are,
or
what
kind
of
a
role
the
aggravating
factors
play
now
under
the
mississippi
statute.
if
the
role
is
diminimus,
then
it's
probably
not
a
"weighing"
state.
but
the
"weighing"
states...
in
the
"weighing"
states,
the
eligibility
factors
are
the
lynchpin
of
the
sentencing
decision.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
it's...
that
is
a--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--that's
what
it
says.
it's
a...
it's
a
phrase,
just
as
it's
in
the
california
statute,
that
directs
the
jury,
as
a
sentencing
factor,
to
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
crime
along
with
any
special
circumstances
found
to
be
true.
and
this
court's
made
it
clear,
in
stringer
and
in
other
cases,
that
how
the
state
court
sees
its
statutory
language
ought
to
be
dispositive.
and
california
has
repeatedly
held...
and
we
submit
it's
not
reasonably
likely
a
jury
would
interpret
it
any
other
way...
that
that
means
that
the
jury
is
to
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case,
all
of
those
facts
and
circumstances,
including
those
that
underlie
the
special
circumstances.
that--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--i'd
agree.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
in
california...
well,
first
of
all,
if
this
is
new
jurisprudence
to
you,
or
unfamiliar,
the
critical
difference
is
that
most
states,
and
most
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
uses
the
term
"aggravating
factor"
and
"eligibility
factor"
interchangeably,
because
in
most
states,
and
particularly
in
the
"weighing"
states,
"aggravating
factor"
is
the
eligibility
factor
that
makes
the
defendant
eligible
for
death,
but
it's
also
the
sole,
or
primary,
factor
that
the
jury
is
to
take
into
consideration
on
the
side
militating
in
favor
of
death.
in
california,
we
have
"eligibility
factors",
which
are
the
special
circumstances,
and
those
happen
at
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
and
then
we
have
11
factors
that
are
totally
different
from
the
special
circumstances
or--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--well,
one
part
of
one
of
them.
in
factor
(a),
there
is
one
reference
to
special
circumstances,
and
that's--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--the
way
that
california
has
interpreted
that...
in
fact,
there
is
a
case
that's
cited
in
these
briefs,
people
versus
cain,
and
morris...
which
is
on
our
merits
brief,
in
page
27,
and
in
our
reply
brief,
on
page
6...
where
a
defendant
in
california
argued
that
that
reference
to
"special
circumstances"
ought
to
be
excised
from
the
direction
to
the
jury
of
what
they're
to
consider
at
sentencing.
and
in
rejecting
the
idea
that
that
should
be
excised,
the
california
supreme
court
said,
"an
instruction
not
to
consider
the
special
circumstances
would
defeat
the
manifest
purpose
of
factor
(a)
to
inform
jurors
that
they
should
consider,
as
one
factor,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
involved
in
the
criminal
episode
that's
on
trial.
"
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
all
of
this
jurisprudence
is
based
on
the
eighth
amendment
requirement--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--that
says
that,
"a
valid
death
penalty
statute
must
provide
sufficient
narrowing--
"
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--that's
the
way
the
eighth
amendment
has
been
interpreted
in
its
application
of
cruel
and
unusual--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--that
factor
was
held
invalid,
but
what--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--well,
yes.
"shall"...
as
interpreted
in
california
versus
brown
by
this
court
and
in
the
california
supreme
court
jurisprudence,
"shall"
is
a
directive,
it's
not...
it's
not...
california
does
not
have
a
mandatory
statute.
in
fact,
none
of
these
factors
are
labeled
as
either
aggravating
or
mitigating.
it's
possible--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--no.
but
whether
or
not
a
crime
is
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel
is
part
of...
apart
from
its
labeling
as
a
special
circumstance,
that's
certainly
a
valid
consideration
for
the
jury
to
be
thinking
about
when
it's
engaged
in
its
normative
process
of
choosing
sentencing.
the
only
thing
that's
different
under
the
california
statute...
when
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
as
a
special
circumstance,
is
out
of
the
mix...
is
whether
it
can
be
labeled
and
whether
that
label
has
any
independent
weight.
but
all
of
the
evidence
and
the--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--description
of
the
crime--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
since
that--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--right.
and
that
instruction
specifically
directs
the
jury
to
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
crime;
and
so,
not
only
the
characteristics
of
all
those
facts,
but
it
would
even
be
appropriate
for
the
prosecutor
to
refer
to
the
crime
as
"heinous
and
atrocious".
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
well,
but--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--but
clemons
is
a
"weighing"
state,
where
those--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--aggravating
or
eligibility
factors
are
at
the
core
of
the
sentencing
decision.
and
that's
not
the
case
in
california.
they're...
these
are
not
the--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--the
lynchpin
of
it.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
well,
in
"weighing"
states,
that's
true,
but--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--no.
we
believe
the
brecht
standard
would
not
apply--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--in
this
instance,
and
that's
because
what
happens--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--yes,
that's
the
pre
aedpa
standard,
and--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--because,
in
this...
if
california
were
a
"weighing"
state...
and
therefore,
the
clemons
ruled
applied...
in
the
first
instance,
the
state
court
has
the
opportunity
to
cure
the
error.
and
if
the
error
is
cured
by
reweighing...
appellate
court
reweighing
the
evidence,
or
appellate
court
harmless
error
analysis,
then
there
is
no
error
to
be
assessed
under
the
brecht
standard.
and
when
it
comes
to
the
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus,
the
error
has
been
cured.
and
so,
brecht
does
not
apply.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
do
we--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--assume
that
the
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
special
circumstance
in
this
case
was
invalid?
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
yes,
it...
we
assume
that,
because,
in
this
case,
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
to
be
invalid.
in
profitt...
and
that's
florida
statute--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--it's
invalid
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
so,
the...
california's
holding
on
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
in
its
engert
case,
which
is
cited
in
these
briefs,
predates
this
court's
holding
in
maynard
that
was
invalid
under
the
eighth
amendment.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
yes,
it
can
be
looked
at--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--that
way.
but
the
other
thing
that
i
wanted
to
say
about
your
question
about
profitt
is
that
florida,
like
some
of
the
other
states,
after
maynard
v.
cartwright
declared
that
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
was
an
inappropriate
eligibility
circumstance
under
the
eighth
amendment,
some
states
have
fashioned
either
instructions
or
changes
in
their
law
to
tailor
their
"heinous
circumstance"
to
meet
the
concerns
that
are
expressed
in
profitt.
but
california
has
never
done
that,
because--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--it
held
it
invalid
under
california
law--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--no.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
that
case
is
engert,
which
is--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--it's
in--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--the
engert
case
specifically
held
that
the
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
circumstance
was
only
invalid
as
an
eligibility
determinant,
because
it
failed
to
adequately
narrow.
so,
it
specifically--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--correct.
and
in
the
engert
case
itself,
the
california
supreme
court
indicated
that
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
would
be
a
valid
sentencing
consideration;
it
just
wasn't
a
valid
narrowing
consideration.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
yes.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
in
this
case--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--yeah.
assuming--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--california
is
a
"weighing"
state--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--then
the
first
step
is
for
this
court...
as
the
ninth
circuit
did,
is
to
look
at
whether
california
performed
a
proper
clemons
review,
which
is
that
the
appellate
court
looks
to
see
whether
there
is
a
principled
and
complete
harmless
error
review.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
there
was
no
such
principled
and
complete
review,
because--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--it
could
have,
but
it...
the
court
did
it
in
two
steps,
and
we
believe
it's
because
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
that
it
couldn't
get
to
brecht
unless
it
found
that
california's
attempt
to
cure
the
error
under
clemons
failed.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
yes.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
that's
correct.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
that's
correct,
that
they
not
only
have
to
have
applied
the
appropriate
standards...
that
is,
the
"beyond
a
reasonable
doubt"
standard,
which
is
the
same
as
california's
"reasonable
possibility"
standard...
they
not
only
have
cried...
applied
the
correct
standard,
but
they
have
to
have
done
so
in
a
principled
and
complete
way
so
the
reviewing
court
can
make
sure
that
they've
actually
cured
the
error.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
and--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--well,
we
think
that
their
analysis
of
the
error
was
fairly
complete.
they
refer
to
the
critical
aspect
of
it.
they
talked
about
the
standard
that
should
be
applied.
and
they
made
clear,
as
they
have...
consistent
with
their
holdings,
that
because
all
the
other
evidence
that
related
to
the
burglary,
felony
murder,
special
circumstance,
or
eligibility
factor
and
the
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
eligibility
factor,
since
all
of
that
evidence
was
properly
before
the
jury
and
the
prosecutor,
and
nothing
about
the
arguments
or
the
instructions
emphasized
the
independent
weight
of
those
eligibility
factors
in
the
sentencing,
that,
therefore,
there
was
no
harm.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
we
think
that
the
burden
of
proof
argument
is
illusory
here,
that
the
way
that
these
things
are
analyzed,
just
as
they
were
in
this
very
case,
is
that
it's
the
court
who
performs
the
analysis,
and
there's
no
discussion
of
which
side
has
to
prove
what.
it's
the
court
who
determines
whether...
what
standard's
to
be
applied
and
whether
that
standard
is
met
by
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--of
the
case.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
well,
the
california...
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
that
"reasonable
possibility"
and
"beyond
a
reasonable
doubt"
are
the
same
thing.
and
those
burden
cases
are
in
a
completely
different
context
than
this.
in
this
case,
in
this
kind
of
circumstance,
when
we're
talking
about
capital
case
sentencing,
it's
the
court
who
does
the
analysis.
there's
no
discussion
of
burden,
and
there's--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--no
placement
of
burden.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
no.
in
this
case,
the
court...
there
is
no
discussion
of
burden.
there--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
in
this
instance,
since
burden
didn't
play
any
role
in
this,
that
there
was...
neither
side
had
any
burden.
the
court
itself
performed
the
analysis.
if
the
court
had--
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
--because
the
word
"weigh"
isn't
the
talisman
for
the
process
that
the
jury
goes
through.
1977
law,
which
everybody
agreed
was
a
1978
capital
sentencing
statute,
that
that
changed
this.
but
the
california
supreme
court
made
clear,
in
its
frierson
decision,
that,
as
far
as
california
is
concerned,
the
process...
the
mental
process
that
the
jury
goes
through
under
either
statute
is
the
same,
that
"weigh",
"consider",
"balance",
so
on,
none
has
the
talismanic
thing.
it's
just
a
metaphorical
description
for
the
jury's
normative
evaluation.
so,
the
term
"weigh"
is
not
dispositive.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
no,
it's
the
same
process.
and
in
california,
too,
a
critical
thing
is
that
that
"aggravating
circumstances"
means
the
sentencing
factors
that
militate
in
favor
of
death;
it
doesn't
mean
that
"eligibility
circumstance".
it
refers
to
those
sentencing
factors.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
i'd
like
to
make
three
quick
points
in
rebuttal.
the
first
is
that,
as
to
the
claim...
ms.
rivkind's
claim,
that
she's
reiterated
here,
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
determined
that
the
"special
circumstances"
label
has
some
independent
weight
that
it's
important
for
the
jury
to
consider
at
sentencing...
she's
only
cited
half
of
the
sentence
in
benson
and
hamilton.
the
other
half
rebuts
her
claim.
the
sentence
is,
"although
we
presume
that
the
jurors
followed
their
instructions
and
considered
the
invalid
special
circumstances
finding,
independent
of
the
underlying
facts.
"
--that's
what
she
relies
on...
they
say,
then,
as
they've
said
in
a
number
of
cases,
"we
cannot
conclude
that
they
could
reasonably
have
given
them
any
independent
significant
weight.
"
so,
it's
just
the
point
we're
making.
it's
just
a
label
that
does
not
carry
with
it
any
independent
significant
weight,
because
the
evidence,
the
argument,
the
circumstances
are
all
before
the
jury
in
the
same
way.
the
second
point
is
that,
while
there
may
be
some
doubt
as
to
whether
mr.
sanders
was
the
actual
killer
in
this
case,
there's
no
question
as
to
his
complete
culpability
in
the
crime.
he
was
the
leader.
he
led
cebreros
there.
he
was
the
one
who
incited
the
crime
in
order
to
cover
up
for
a
prior
botched
robbery.

i
don't
think
that's
an
appropriate
consideration
here,
where
it
wasn't
raised,
ever.
the
third
point
is
that
we
wouldn't
be
here,
except
for
the
overlap
in
factor...
sentencing
factor
(a).
that
subclause,
which
the
california
supreme
court
has
repeatedly
held,
means
only
that
the
jury
is
to
consider
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
crime,
including
the
facts
and
circumstances
underlying
the
special
circumstance,
or
eligibility
factor.
if
that
subclause
wasn't
in
there,
our
eligibility
factors
in
the
special
circumstance,
and
our
sentencing
factors,
would
be
completely
mutually
exclusive
and
there
would
be
no
issue
whatsoever.
ms.
jane
n.
kirkland
thank
you.
