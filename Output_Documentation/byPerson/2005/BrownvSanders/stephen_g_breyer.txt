justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
i'm
not...
this
is
a
fairly
complex
area.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
as
i
understand,
at
this
moment...
and
i
hope
you'll
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
in
a
"weighing"
state,
we
look
at
the
aggravating
side,
and
there
seem,
let's
say,
to
be
three
factors
that
you
could
take
into
account
and
weigh
them
against
all
the
mitigation.
i'm
imagining
that.
and
you
might
have
thought,
if
factor
one
turns
out
to
be
invalid,
the
reason
that
that's
a
big
mistake,
because
the
jury
would
have
weighed
something
against
all
that
mitigating
evidence
that
it
shouldn't
have.
and
what's
something?
there
would
be
a
lot
of
evidence
on
it,
so
it
took
it...
evidence
into
account
it
shouldn't
have.
so,
i
might
have
thought
that
was
so.
but
when
i
read
the
cases,
that
isn't
so,
because
i
think
it's...
in
clemons
the
evidence
would
have
come
in
anyway.
so,
if
that
isn't
so,
what
could
be
wrong
with
this
problem
in
the
"weighing"
state?
and
the
answer,
i
guess,
has
to
be
that
the
prosecutor
or
the
state
said,
"jury,
you
look
to
these
three
things.
"
with
a
tone
of
voice
that
really
made
them
important.
and
the
jury
then
weighed
one
and
two
and
three.
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
evidence.
well,
if
that's
the
problem,
california
seems
to
have
that
problem,
because
one
of
the
things
it
says
to
weigh
is,
"weigh
circumstances
of
the
crime".
and
that
means
that's
not
everything.
that's
not
the
history
of
this
defendant.
and
so,
the
problem
that
existed
in
clemons
and
in
stringer
and
in
zant
that
led
to
constitutional
error
seems
to
be
there
in
california's
case,
too.
now,
i
probably
have
made
five
mistakes
in
my
little
recitation
here,
and
i'd
ask
you
to
point
them
out.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
word
"special
circumstances"
is
ambiguous,
because
it
might
refer
to
something
in
the
world,
in
which
case
it's
about
evidence,
or
it
might
refer
to
something
in
the
law,
in
which
case
it's
a
statement
by
a
prosecutor
to
look
at
some
of
this
evidence
and
give
it
some
special
weight.
now,
that
what's
confusing
me
throughout.
as
i
understood
this
area,
to
go
back
to
what
justice
scalia
was
saying...
no,
wait,
just...
i'll
back
up
to
try
to
get
you
to
correct
my
misunderstanding...
zant
is
the
key,
because
zant
says,
"judge,
if
you
have
a
"nonweighing"
state.
"
--that
is,
everything's
relevant
but
the
kitchen
sink...
"the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
made
a
mistake
at
the
eligibility
stage
by
including
something
he
shouldn't
is
beside
the
point.
"
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
then
we
look
at
stringer
and
clemons,
and
they're
making
exceptions
to
zant.
and
they're
making
exceptions
for
"weighing"
states.
so,
even
if
the
evidence
in
all
three
cases
is
identical
and
it
made
no
difference
to
the
evidence...
that
is,
to
what
really
happened
in
the
world...
still,
says
clemons
and
stringer...
still,
you're
not
home
free
yet,
state.
rather,
you
have
to
back
up
and
do
harmless
error
analysis.
so,
the
answer,
i
think,
to
justice
scalia,
if
i
understand
it,
is,
justice
scalia,
you
may
be
right,
maybe
all
this
is
harmless,
but
we
don't
have
before
us
the
product
of
harmless
error
analysis,
because
you
didn't
grant
cert
on
it,
among
other
reasons.
now,
if
i'm
right
so
far,
and
if
we
want
to
straighten
all
this
out,
why
not
go
back
and
say
all
three
cases
are
wrong?
what
you
really
ought
to
do
is
say,
"court,
always
conduct
harmless
error
analysis.
"
"conduct
it
whether
you're
in
"nonweighing",
conduct
it
whether
you're
in
"weighing",
we'll
simplify.
"
now,
what
would
be
so
terrible
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we
would
not
have
this
crossword
puzzle,
which
probably
only
five
people
in
the
united
states
understand,
and
the
worst
thing
that
would
happen
would
be,
you'd
always
conduct
harmless
error
analysis,
and
thus,
if
justice
scalia
is
right
about
it,
you
would
lose,
and
if...
because
it
would
be
harmless...
and
if
he's
wrong
about
it,
you'd
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
and
i
can
imagine,
in
"nonweighing"
state,
a
prosecutor
banging
on
and
on,
at
the
eligibility
stage,
on
factor
x,
and
really
fixing
that
in
the
mind
of
the
jury,
and
it
turns
out
that
factor
x
is
not
an
aggravator.
now,
the
jury
might
have
been
prejudiced.
and
i
can
imagine,
in
a
"weighing"
state
that,
because
the
evidence
is
the
same,
and
because
there
were
so
many
factors
just
like
it,
the
fact
that
they
used
the
wrong
factor
didn't
really
make
any
difference.
so,
it
seems
to
me
the
lineup
between
harm...
real
harm
in
a
case,
and
weighing/nonweighing,
it
doesn't
line
up
terribly
well.
but
you
have
the
experience.
and
that's
why
i'd
like
your
reaction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
i
mean,
a
serious
effort
to
go
back
and
say,
"look,
harmless
error
throughout".
i
mean,
i'm
pushing
the
same
thing
i
said
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
