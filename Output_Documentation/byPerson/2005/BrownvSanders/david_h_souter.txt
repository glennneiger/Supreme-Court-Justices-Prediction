justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
that
that,
at
least,
is
not
the
way
the
jury
was
instructed
in
this
case?
as
i
understand
it,
the...
and
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me,
but
i
looked
when
i
was
going
through
the
briefs...
the
jury
was
instructed
to
consider
the
special
circumstance,
or
stances,
as
such.
they
were
not
instructed
that,
"you
will
simply
consider
the
facts
that
underlay
whatever
conclusion
you
drew
at
the...
at
the
earliest
stage
about
special
circumstances.
"
they
are
instructed
to
consider
special
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
such.
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
calls
them
special
circumstances,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
that
may
be
an
argument
for
the
way
we
have
looked
at
special
circumstances,
is
as
something...
as
factors
that
do
carry
a
special
weight,
but
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
differentiate
the
instruction
to
consider
special
circumstances
here
from
the
instructions
in
law
to
consider
eligibility
factors
in
other
states,
which
we
have
called
"weighing"
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
know
what
you're
saying,
because,
in
california,
you've
got
a
long
list
of
other
things,
and
you're
entirely
right.
but,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
states
that
we
have
classified
as
"weighing"
states,
the
juries
were
not...
were
not
strictly
limited,
on
the
aggravating
side,
to
consider
only
the
special
circumstances
or
the
aggravating
factors,
as
they
have
been
previously
defined;
they
could
consider
other
things.
and
that's
the
case
here.
so,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
draw
a
categorical
distinction
between
california's
situation
and
that
of
states
we've
called
"weighing"
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
thought
in
mississippi
they
could
take
into
consideration
other
facts.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
this
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--don't
we
assume
that
the
court
follows
california
law
on
the...
on
the
burden?
and
isn't
it
clear
that,
under
california
law,
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
there
is
no
discussion
of
burden.
but
when
there
is
no
discussion
of
burden,
isn't
the
reasonable
assumption
for
us
to
make,
as
a
reviewing
court,
the
assumption
that
the
california
supreme
court
followed
its
own
law,
and
its
own
law
is
that
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
aren't
we
in,
sort
of,
the
converse
situation
here?
there
isn't
any
question
about
the
admissibility
of
evidence
that
shouldn't
otherwise
have
come
in.
i
thought
your
argument
here
is,
the
error
proceeds
from
the
fact
that,
by
using
this
label...
by
referring
to
the
circumstance
as
a
"special
circumstance",
having
been
found
at
the
eligibility
stage...
that
circumstance,
and
all
the
evidence
that
might
support
it,
is
given
extra
weight,
and
that's
where
the
thumb
on
the
scale
comes.
isn't
that
your
point
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
what
i
thought
i
was
trying
to
say.
i
mean,
am
i
getting
it
wrong?
because
this
is
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--time
to
correct
me,
if
i
am.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't...
i
want
to
throw
you
a
suggestion...
isn't
the
answer
to
that
problem
that
anything
may
be
considered
as
mitigating
evidence,
but
a
mitigating
factor
is
a
conclusion
that
evidence
has
a
certain
significance,
and
not
everything
may
be
taken
into
consideration
as
a
mitigating
factor?
isn't...
the
problem
that
justice
scalia
raises
addressed
by
distinguishing
between
evidence...
consider
it
all...
and
factors,
a
characterization
of
evidence
which
may
not
necessarily
be
considered.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
i
misspoke.
but,
i
mean,
the
distinction
between
"evidence"
and
"factor"
is
the...
is
the
key,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
that
means
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
was
correct
under
the
law,
wasn't
it?
in
other
words,
"special
circumstance"
means
the
same
thing
when
it's
referred
to...
the
term
means
the
same
thing
when
it's
referred
to
in
the
statute
on
selection
as
it
means
in
the
statute
on
eligibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
