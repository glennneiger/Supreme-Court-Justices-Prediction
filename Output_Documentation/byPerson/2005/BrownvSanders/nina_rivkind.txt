ms.
nina
rivkind
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
observation
that
we
need
to
look
at
what
the
jury
was
instructed,
because
i
think
that
will
clarify
for
the
court
that
california's
1978
law
is,
indeed,
a
"weighing"
statute
under
the
established
law
of
this
court.
in
mr.
sanders'
case,
the
jury
was
instructed
in
the
language
of
section
190.3,
and
this
language
gave
the
jury
a
very
explicit
roadmap
as
to
how
it
was
to
undertake
its
sentence
selection
in
this
case.
section
190.3
assigns
a
specific
role
to
the
aggravating
factors.
it
tells
a
jury
that,
"in
determining
the
penalty,
you
shall
consider,
take
into
account,
and
be
guided
by
the
listed
enumerated
factors.
"
the
special
circumstances,
as
the
questions
from
the
court
have
noted,
are
specifically
included.
factor
(a)
has
two
independent
components,
and
one
is
the
existence
of
any
"special
circumstance"
finding.
as
justice
stevens
noted,
this
could
only
be
considered
aggravating.
it
is,
after
all,
the
reason
that
california
has
said
that
this
case
moved
from
being
an
ordinary
murder
to
being
one
that
was
worthy
of
either
death
or
life
without
parole.
ms.
nina
rivkind
i--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--well,
no,
i
think
it's
not,
and
i
think
it's
very
consistent
with
what
we
see
in
mississippi.
in
california,
factor
(a)
contains
two
independent
components.
one
is
the
"circumstances
of
the
crime",
and
one
is
the
"special
circumstances".
the
california
supreme
court,
both
before
it
affirmed
mr.
sanders'
death
sentence
and
after...
before,
in
a
case,
people
versus
hamilton,
and
after,
in
people
versus
benson...
in
the
context
of
assessing
invalid
special
circumstances,
said
that
it
presumes
the
jury
follows
its
instructions,
and
considers
the
special
circumstances
independently
of
their
underlying
facts.
ms.
nina
rivkind
i
don't
think
that
distinction
holds
up.
and
i
think
that
we
see
that
both
in
clemons
and
in
stringer.
and
this
takes
us
to
a
misunderstanding
of
the
mississippi
statute.
in
mississippi,
the
statute
has
not
changed
since
the
time
of
clemons,
except
for
one
provision,
and
that
is
the
addition
of
another
category
of
capital
murder.
in
mississippi,
death
eligibility
is
decided
by
the
definition
of
97-3-19.
and
the
state
lists,
i
think,
now
nine...
i
think
it
was
eight
at
the
time
of
clemons...
categories
of
capital
murder.
the
defendant
then
goes
to
a
penalty
phase,
and
the
statute
sets
forth
aggravating
circumstances
in
mississippi's
statute,
section
99-19-101.
there
is
a
correlation
between
many...
at
the
time
of
clemons,
all
of
the
categories
of
capital
murder
and
the
aggravating
circumstances,
much
as
there
is
in
louisiana.
however,
there
are
two
additional
aggravating
factors
at
the
sentence
selection
phase,
and
those
are
the
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
aggravator,
which,
in
mississippi,
is
only
a
selection
factor,
and
whether
the
defendant
had
a
prior
conviction.
and
so,
in
this
sense,
we...
the
mississippi
statute
is
very
comparable
to
california.
and
it
goes
further,
because,
in
mississippi...
in
clemons'
case,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
at
24,
and
also
in
stringer's
case,
at
joint
appendix
10...
the
juries
were
instructed,
pursuant
to
the
mississippi
standard
capital
sentencing
instructions...
the
very
first
opening
paragraph
tells
the
juries
that,
"in
determining
penalty,
you
must
objectively
consider
the
detailed
circumstances
of
the
crime.
"
and
i
think
this
instruction
helps
explain
the
court's
footnote
5
in
clemons,
which
i
think
is
very
important
in
terms
of
understanding
why
this
whole
focus
on
circumstances
of
the
crime
is
not
relevant
to
the
distinction
between
"weighing"
and
"nonweighing".
ms.
nina
rivkind
i
think
the
harm
is...
there
is
harm.
i
think
the
fact
that
the
jury
considers
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
in
california,
as
an
aggravating
factor.
it
may
go
to
prejudice.
certainly,
the
nature
of
a
statute
will
inform
a
court's
prejudice
analysis.
but
mr.
sanders
went
into
the
penalty
phase
essentially
with
four
weights
on
death's
side
of
the
scale,
based
solely
on
the
special
circumstances,
and
two
of
those
weights
should
not
have
been
there.
and
his
jury
was
given
a
very--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--i
have
two
responses,
your
honor.
first,
the
rule...
the
distinction
between
"weighing"
and
"nonweighing"
is
not
an
evidentiary
rule.
it
is
a
rule
about
the
statutory
labels
that
a
state
gives
to
the
factors
that
the
jury
puts
on
death's
side
of
the
scale.
even
in
a
"nonweighing"
state,
as
zant
made
clear,
if
an...
where
a
harmless
error
review
need
not
be
done,
because
the
court
has
concluded
there
will
be...
the
aggravating
circumstances
have
an
inconsequential
impact,
because
the
jury
is
not
required
to
consider
them
in
the
selection
decision...
even
there,
if
an
invalid
aggravating
circumstance
permits
the
introduction
of
evidence
that
would
otherwise
have
been
inadmissible,
we
have
error.
and
that's
the
conclusion
that
the--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--my
argument
is
that
the
"special
circumstance"
finding,
itself,
is
the
invalid
aggravating
factor
on
death's
side
of
the
scale.
that
is
what
the
california
supreme
court--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--no.
ms.
nina
rivkind
no,
the...
the
jury
could
consider
the
facts
of
the
crime,
as
in
mississippi.
the
jury
is
told
to
consider
all
the
crime
facts
when
deciding
the
penalty.
and
in
california
the
jury
could
have
considered
the
manner
of
the
killing
and
who
was
killed
and
how
the
crime
proceeded.
the
harm
to
mr.
sanders
was
that
the
jury
was
told
that
it
had
a
process
that
was
mandated
for
reaching
its
decision,
and
that
process
required
the
jury
to
put
two
special
circumstances
on
death's
side
of
the
scale,
that
should
not
have
been
there,
and
then
required
the
jury
to
reach
the
penalty
decision
by
balancing.
ms.
nina
rivkind
i
think
it's
more
than
that,
because
i...
i
think
if...
the
harm
is--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--it
is
more
than
that,
because
we
have
to
think
of
how
the
jury
is
understanding
this.
to
ordinary
citizens
who
are
called
to
stand
in
ultimate
judgment--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--yes.
ms.
nina
rivkind
no.
ms.
nina
rivkind
i
don't
read
bacigalupo
as
saying
that.
bacigalupo
did
not
deal
with
the
question
of
invalid
special
circumstances
being
weighed
at
penalty
selection.
i
think
the
more
appropriate
authority
of
the
california
supreme
court
are
its
hamilton
and
benson
decisions,
wherein,
addressing
exactly
the
situation,
a
claim
that
invalid
special
circumstances
tainted
the
death
sentence,
the
court
said,
specifically,
"we
presume
the
jury
weighs
those
special
circumstances,
apart
from
the--
"
ms.
nina
rivkind
--that
is
correct.
ms.
nina
rivkind
your
honor,
if
i
were
able
to
write
on
a
clean
slate,
that
is
the
rule
i
would
propose.
i
think
that
if
you...
the
whole
idea
of
zant
was
carving
out
an
exception
from
conducting
harmless
error
review,
and
the
court
was
assured
that
because
the
aggravating
circumstance,
which
was
only
a
death
eligibility
factor,
fell
away
at
the
selection
stage,
there
was
really...
it
was...
the
impact
of
that
aggravating
circumstance
was
likely
to
be
inconsequential,
as
the
georgia
supreme
court
found,
and
as
this
court
found
in
zant.
the
simple
approach
would
be
to
apply
harmless
error
review,
no
matter
what
the
structure
of
the
statute--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--i
think...
i--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--and--
[laughter]
and
i--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--your
honor,
i
think
we
first
need
to
distinguish
between
the
lack
of
a
formal
mitigation
case
and
the
absence
of
mitigating
factors.
in
this
case,
in
reviewing
a
different
claim,
the
california
supreme
court...
and
i
refer
the
court
to
joint
appendix
108,
i
believe
is
the
cite...
the
california
supreme
court
found
that
mr.
sanders'
decision
to
refuse
to
take
part
in
the
penalty
phase
did
not
necessarily
make
a
death
sentence
more
likely,
and
it
also
found
that
the
jury
could
have
found
mitigating
factors
from
the
guilt
phase
evidence.
indeed,
the
jury
was
instructed
to
consider
the
evidence
from
all
parts
of
the
trial.
ms.
nina
rivkind
so,
i
think
there
was
a--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--the
main
mitigating
evidence
was
a
powerful
mitigating
factor
which
went
to
the
personal
culpability
of
mr.
sanders,
and
that
was
that
the
prosecutor,
in
his
closing
guilt
phase
argument,
told
the
jury,
"we
don't
know
whether
mr.
sanders
was
the
actual
killer
or
whether
his
codefendant,
mr.
cebreros,
was.
"
and
there
was
evidence
from
the
surviving
victim
that
there
was
a
conversation
between
the
two
assailants,
before
the
surviving
victim
was
struck,
in
which
one
of
the
men
said
he
wanted
to
leave
the
apartment.
and,
again,
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
which
defendant
this
was.
this
court,
in
green
versus
georgia,
has
realized
that
whether
someone
is
an
actual
killer
or
an
accomplice
is
of
critical
importance
in
deciding
between
life
and
death.
that
was
the
main
powerful
mitigating
factor
in
this
case.
and--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--i
think
it
is
mitigating,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
a
question
about
one
of
the
people,
perhaps
the
accomplice,
which
very
well
could
have
been
mr.
sanders,
wanting
to
leave
before
the
murder
occurred
was
basis
enough
to
give
the
jury
pause.
and
if
we
look
at
the
deliberations,
we
realize
that
there
was
a
jury
note,
about
three
quarters
of
the
way
through
its
deliberations,
asking
the
jury
the
consequences
if
it
could
not
reach
a
unanimous--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--you
mean
in
the
trial
court.
ms.
nina
rivkind
no,
in
the...
in
the
ninth
circuit,
residual
doubt
was
argued.
it
is
a
mitigating
factor
in--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--no,
in
the
trial
part,
nothing
was
argued,
because
trial
counsel
acquiesced
to
mr.
sanders'
request
that
there
be
no
penalty
defense.
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
this
is
not
a
case
because
mr.
sanders
wanted
death.
as
his
trial
counsel
told
the
court,
mr.
sanders
insisted
he
was
innocent
and
wanted
to
go
home.
the
trial
court
made
it
very
clear
to
him,
that
wasn't
an
option.
ms.
nina
rivkind
it...
there
was
a
statement
that
he
did
not
want
either
penalty.
ms.
nina
rivkind
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
odd.
i
think
what
that
recognizes
is
that
the
court
has
said,
"while
you
do
not
have
to
give
a...
we
do
not
need
a
guided
discretion
statute.
"
--that,
as
zant
holds,
a
jury
can
have
complete,
absolute
discretion
in
choosing
between
life
and
death...
that
when
a
state
does
regulate
that,
it
must
be
done
within
the
contours
of
the
constitution.
the
essential
wisdom
in
the
distinction
between
"weighing"--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--but
it...
i
don't...
again,
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
evidence,
i
think
it's
a
question
of
what
are
those
factors
that
are
being
put
in...
on...
in
death's
side
of
the
scale,
and
how
are
they
being
balanced--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--in
terms
of
the
rule
of--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--i...
i'd
like
harmless
error
analysis.
i
think...
i
think
that
would
be
a
simpler
approach.
it
would
accommodate
competing
interests,
because
each
state's
statute
would
be
informing
the
prejudice
analysis,
and
you
would
be
looking
at
how
many
different
sentencing
selection
factors
were
before
the
jury.
ms.
nina
rivkind
i--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't...
i
didn't--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--get
the
question.
ms.
nina
rivkind
i
think
if
we
had...
well,
i
first
would
like
to
clarify
something
you
said.
i
think,
under
the
existing
law,
it's
not...
it
is
not
just
eligibility
factors,
the
invalidity
of
eligibility
factors...
that
create...
arbitrarily
skew
the
sentencing,
that,
as
we
see
in
mississippi,
the
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
was
only
a
selection
factor.
so,
i
think
it...
this
focus
on
an
equivalence
or
a
overlap
between
eligibility
and
selection
factors
is
just
not
found
in
the
court's
case
law.
ms.
nina
rivkind
well,
in--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--in
this--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--case,
yes.
the
special
circumstances
that
are
the
invalid
aggravating
factors
were
eligibility
requirements.
but
that
is
not...
as
the
federal
death
penalty
shows,
that
is
not
a
prerequisite
in
the
weighing/nonweighing
distinction.
and
i
think
i
didn't
answer
the
second
part
of
your
question,
but,
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
remember
it--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--about--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--well,
i
think
they
would
be.
i
mean,
the
way
i
would
envision
it
is
that
if
the
jury
weighs
an
invalid
factor...
and
under
sochor,
the
invalidity
does
not
have
to
be
based
on
federal
constitutional
law.
state
law
invalidity
creates
the
same
harm;
you're
arbitrarily
skewing
the
process
toward
death.
ms.
nina
rivkind
if--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--in
sochor.
ms.
nina
rivkind
in
this
case,
it's
invalid
as
to
both,
because
it
serves
both
purposes.
it's...
first,
sees
it
as
an
eligibility
factor,
and
then
the...
the
provision
says...
it
doesn't
say
just
to
consider
special
circumstances
in
some
vague,
undefined
way;
it
specifically
refers
the
jury
back
to
its
findings
at
the
guilt
phase.
section
190.3,
subsection
(a),
says,
"consider
the
existence
of
an...
any
special
circumstances
found
true
at
the
guilt
phase.
"
that's
telling
the
jury,
"your...
the
findings
that
made
the
defendant
get
the
death
penalty--
"
ms.
nina
rivkind
--in--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--no,
i
think
if
it's
invalid
for
one,
it's
invalid
for
the
other.
ms.
nina
rivkind
the
california...
the...
in
engert,
the
question
was
eligibility.
in
this
case,
the
question
was
only
selection.
and
the
california
supreme
court...
the
state
conceded
that
the
"heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
"
circumstance
was
invalid,
and
the
court,
in
this
case,
addressed
its
use
as
a
selection
factor.
ms.
nina
rivkind
well,
the
eighth
amendment,
as
this
court
said
in
tuilaepa,
does
apply
to
the
selection
factors.
it
looks
as...
at
whether
there's
a
commonsense
core
meaning.
ms.
nina
rivkind
yeah,
i'm
confused.
ms.
nina
rivkind
okay.
because
we're--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--okay.
because
we're
talking
about
aggravating
factors.
ms.
nina
rivkind
it's
the
key,
because
the
consideration
of
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
is
not
the
problem
that
we
have.
what
we
have
is
that
the
jury's
told
to
consider
this
fact
or
this
finding
that
the
jury
understands
makes
the
defendant...
because
the
state
has
said
this
is
a
reason
both
to
make
him
death
eligible
and
a
reason
to
impose
death...
creates
a
weight
on
death's
side
of
the
scale.
ms.
nina
rivkind
yes.
ms.
nina
rivkind
well,
i
think
the
prosecutor's
argument
in
this
case
shows
that
they
understood
it
as
the
finding.
the
prosecutor
here
argued...
in
the
precise
language
of
the
special
circumstance,
argued
that
this...
"the
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel
nature
of
this
crime.
"
parroting
the
language
of
the
special
circumstance.
clearly,
the
jury,
i
think--
ms.
nina
rivkind
--yes.
ms.
nina
rivkind
in
this
case,
what
