ms.
kirkland,
assume
for
a
moment...
i
know
you
don't
agree,
but
assume
that
the
court,
or
a
majority
of
it,
were
to
hold
that
california
appears
to
be
a
"weighing"
state.
this
case
arose
before
the
enactment
of
the
federal
law
that
we
call
aedpa.
so,
i
guess
pre
aedpa
law
governs.
and
we
would
then
have
to
consider...
what
+/?
whether
this
is
harmless
error?
but
the
third
question
that
you
raised
was...
apparently
did
not
incorporate
any
consideration
of
the
brecht
standard.
is
that
what
would
be
applied
if
we
had
to
address
the
consequence
here,
of
holding
it
to
be
a
"weighing"
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wasn't
that
the
pre
aedpa
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
why
wouldn't
that
apply?
