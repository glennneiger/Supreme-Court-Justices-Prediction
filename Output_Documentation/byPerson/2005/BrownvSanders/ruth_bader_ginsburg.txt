so,
you
would
say
clemons
should
come
out
the
other
way,
given
the
current
state
of
the
mississippi
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
not
totally
different,
because
one
of
them
is
special
circumstances.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
distinguishes
those
from
circumstances
of
the
crime,
and
then
it...
then
it
says,
"and
special
circumstances".
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
"special
circumstances"
is
a
discrete
factor,
different
from
"circumstances
of
the
crime".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
you
said
that
the
error
was
harmless
under
chapman,
the
higher
standard--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that
the
california
court
so
ruled.
and
if
that
ruling
is
correct,
then
you
would
never
get
to
any
brecht
standard;
the
federal
court
would
have
to
say
california
applied
the
proper
harmless
error
analysis,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the...
so
the
second
question,
once
we
get
past
weighing,
is
whether
california,
in
fact,
did
do
what
chapman
said.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
problem--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--here
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
decision
is
rather
skimpy
once
you
get
to
harmless
error.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was...
the
argument
was
that,
in
california,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
defendant,
instead
of
on
the
prosecutor
for
the
harmless
error
inquiry?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying...
because
this
can
get
pretty
complex...
simply,
that
because
special
circumstances
are
a
discreet
category,
that,
in
effect,
what
went...
what
the
court
is
instructing
is
double
counting
that
factor?
it's
a
factor
in
all
the
circumstances
how
the...
how
the
crime
was
committed
is
a
factor
of
all
circumstances;
and
then,
in
addition,
it
is
a
special
circumstance.
so
it
is,
in
effect,
counted
twice.
is
that
the
essence
of
your
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
the
california
supreme
court
that
has
to
do
the
harmless
error,
in
the
first
instance?
and
here,
this
is
puzzling
about
this
case.
defendant
said,
at
trial,
to
his
lawyer,
"don't
argue
any
mitigators.
"
"i'd
just
as
soon
die
as
spend
my
life
in
prison.
"
so,
no
mitigators
were
argued.
so
then,
even
if
you
have
a
wrong
aggravator,
you
have
other
aggravators
that
are
right,
and
there's
nothing
to
weigh
against
those
correct
aggregators.
so,
what
mitigation
is
there
to
weigh
against
the
valid
aggravators?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
were
those?
i
see
that
sentence.
the
jury--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
what
were
the
mitigating
factors
from
the
evidence
presented
at
the
guilt
phase?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
you're
getting
into
what
has
sometimes
been
called
"residual
doubt".
you
point
out
that
a
juror
asked,
"what
if
it
were
not
unanimous?
"
and
you
also
pointed
out
that
there
was
an
earlier
hung
jury
in
this
case.
but
you
didn't
argue,
below,
that
residual
doubt
counts.
it's
one
thing
to
say,
"if
defendant
argues
it,
the
court
should
take
it
into
account.
"
but
there
was
no
such
argument
made
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
any
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
trial
court,
it
wasn't,
because
that's
when
it
would
count.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't...
wasn't
there
a
statement
that
he
was
indifferent
between
death
and
life
imprisonment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mean
aggravating--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
that
such
residual
doubt
factors
are
appropriately
considered
if
the
defendant
didn't
raise
them?
i
mean,
the
question
of...
that,
yes,
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
maybe
there's
something
that
makes
that
determination
doubtful.
