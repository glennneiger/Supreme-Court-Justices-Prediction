argument
next
in
brown
vs.
sanders.
ms.
kirkland,
proceed,
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
was
confused
by
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
do
you
think
the...
we
should
review
the
california
supreme
court's
harmless
error
analysis,
or
should
we
undertake
a
brecht
analysis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
assuming
you'd...
we'd--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
lose
on
the
first
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
that
that
might
have
collapsed
into
the
brecht
analysis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
kirkland.
ms.
rivkind.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
the...
but
the
evidence
supporting
them
was
perfectly
admissible.
so,
the
jury
could
consider
that
evidence
and
come
to
the
same
conclusion;
it's
just
the
label
that
seems
to
be
giving
you
the
most
concern.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
didn't
the
california
supreme
court
answer
that
in--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--its
bacigalupo--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--decision,
where,
as
i
read
it,
it
says
juries
don't
give
special
circumstances
any
extra
weight
in
considering
all
the
variety
of
factors
listed
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
it's
only
invalid
as
an
eligibility
factor.
it's
not
invalid
as
a
selection
factor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
rivkind.
ms.
kirkland,
you
have
two
and
a
half
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
kirkland.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

case
