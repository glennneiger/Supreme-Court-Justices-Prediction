justice
john
paul
stevens
and
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
california
statute,
if
i
may,
please?
in
subsection
(a)
of
190.3,
it
says
that
the
trier
of
fact
"shall"
take
into
account
any
of
the
following
factors,
if
relevant.
and
one
of
those
is
the
existence
of
any
special
circumstance
found
to
be
true,
pursuant
to
190.1.
and
under
190.1,
one
of
the
special
circumstances
is
number
14,
"heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel.
"
does
that
mean
the
statute
required
in
the
weighing
process...
that
the
jury
take
into
account
that
factor?
and
is
it
not
true
that
factor
was
held
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
they
were...
they
were
directed
to
take
into...
they
"shall"
take
into
account
an
invalid
factor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the...
number
14
clearly
is
not
mitigating.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
of
the
evidence--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
agree,
though,
that,
if
you
had
a
separate
sentencing
jury,
one
that
did
not
have
all
the
evidence,
and
that
jury
was
instructed
that
at
the
guilt
phase
a
determination
has
been...
that
has...
it
has
been
found
that
the
crime
was
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
and
so
forth,
that
that
finding
might
tip
the
scales
in
favor
of
imposing
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
underlying
facts
are
already
before
the
jury,
and
they
can
make
their
own
judgment
about
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
that
concerns
me
about
this
case...
unlike
zant,
most
of
the
cases
in
which
we
have
found
the
label
of
aggravating...
immaterial...
or
findings
like
prior
criminal
histories...
robbery,
or
something
like...
but
whenever
a
pejorative
factor
of
this
kind
has
been
found,
we've
generally
found
it
did
tilt
the
scales
a
little
bit
on
the...
on
the...
in
favor
of
death.
clemons
and
the
other
were
cases
of
this
kind
of
aggravating--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--circumstance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--cases
in
which
we
have
held
a
fact
of...
a
finding
of
the
fact
of
this
kind
was
irrelevant,
was
harmless?
i
think
the
cases
are
all
the
other--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
one
quick
question,
if
you
can
comment...
the
statute
expressly
says,
"they
shall
impose
a
sentence
of
death
if
the
trier
of
fact
concludes
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances.
"
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
why
is
it
not
a
"weighing"
state
when
it
says
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
term
"concluding
that
it
does
outweigh"
is
something
different
from
"weighing".
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in...
would
you
clarify
something?
is
it
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
california
law
that
the...
the
california
court
held,
in
effect,
that
you
may
not
consider
the
fact
that
the
crime
was
heinous
and
atrocious
for
purposes
of
deciding
whether
he's
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
but
you
may
consider
that
fact
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
to
impose
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
what
the
california
court
would
say?
