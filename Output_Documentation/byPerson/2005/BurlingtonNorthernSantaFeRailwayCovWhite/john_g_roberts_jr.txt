chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
burlington
northern
and
santa
fe
railway
company
v.
white.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
has
been
endorsed
by
the
eeoc,
though.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
in...
in
the
absence
of
any
suggestion
that
the
collective
bargaining
process
is
also
infected
with
sex
discrimination,
why
can't
we
rely
on
that
process
to
give
some
basis
to
the
job
descriptions?
in
other
words,
forklift
operator
was
not
a
separate
job
from
rail
yard
employee,
and
if
the
union
wanted
to
make
them
separate
jobs,
they
could
negotiate
that,
but
they
didn't.
so
why...
why
do
we
regard
that
as
a
material
change
when
you're
doing
one
part
of
a
job
as
opposed
to
another
part
of
a
job?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
difference
there
is
that's
an
employer
unilaterally.
we
don't
have
that
here.
the
employer
is
dealing
with
the
union.
if
the
jobs
really
were
that
different,
the
union
would
categorize
them
differently
and
negotiate
for
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
your
approach
require
an
employer
to
keep
shuffling
the
employees
around
so
they
don't
get
a
sort
of
adverse
possession
of
particular
types
of
job
responsibilities?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
suspension,
what...
what
if
she
had
been...
during
the
process
of
investigation,
she
had
been
allowed
to
stay
on
the
job
with
pay?
in
other
words,
the
facts
are
the
same.
it's
just
that
the...
the
sort
of
stay
process
works
the
other
way
and
she's
not
relieved
until
the
end
of
the
company's
investigation.
is
the
initiation
of
that
an
materially
adverse
employment
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
donati.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
she'd
been
operating
the
forklift
for
only
a
week
and
then
she
was
reassigned?
would
that
still
be
discrimination
under
any
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
said
earlier
that
the
act...
one
of
the
protections
against
trivial
charges
was
that
the
act
had
to
be
the
act
of
the
employer.
if
the
employer
sets
up
a
review
system
in
which
the
final
act
of
the
employer
is
the
decision,
why
is
a
preliminary
charge,
initial
suspension,
review...
why
are
those
also
considered
acts
of
the
employer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
that
mean,
it
was
not
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
presumably
you
paid...
the
person
who
did
that
was
paid
wages
pursuant
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
position
is
that
it
would
be
an...
it
would
be
a
covered
employment
action
even
if
none
of
that
were
true,
she
didn't
lose
pay,
she
didn't
lose
benefits,
so
long
as
there
was
the
initiation
of
the
disciplinary
action.
you
regard
that
as
sufficiently
adverse
under
704.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
other
than
eligibility
for
punitive
damages.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what...
what
if
she
operated
the
forklift
usually
3
out
of
5
days,
and
the
other
2
days
was
pulling
up
the
rail
ties
and...
and
the
shift
was
now
she
does...
operates
the
forklift
2
out
of
5
days
and
3
out
of
5
days
she's
pulling
up
rail
ties?
is
that
materially
adverse?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
in
05-259,
burlington
northern
and
santa
fe
railway
versus
white.
