mr.
donald
a.
donati
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
when
burlington
northern
reassigned
ms.
white
from
the
forklift
to
the
track
and
then
removed
her
without
pay
for
37
days
during
christmas,
it,
quote,
discriminated
against
ms.
white
under
any
reasonable
standard,
the
eeoc
standard,
the
plain
language
standard,
or
the
standard
that
the
unanimous
en
banc
court
of
the
sixth
circuit
adopted.
whatever
standard
the
court
applies,
ms.
white
should
prevail,
if
it's
a
reasonable
standard,
other
than
that
of
the...
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
with
respect
to
the
motivation,
if
there...
if
there
was
a
motivation,
a
retaliatory
motivation,
according
to
the
proper
reading
of
704,
it
would
be
because
what
that
aims
at
is
motivation.
and
the
question
was
asked,
and...
and
a
legitimate
question
was
asked.
why
would
congress
make
704(a)
more
expansive
than
703?
well,
if
you
look
at
the
text
of
704(a)
at
the
beginning
of
the
caption,
it
says,
discriminate
in
assisting,
participating,
or
cooperating
with
enforcement.
this...
this
provision,
as
the
dissent
said
in
the
jackson
case
last
term,
in
referring
to
retaliation,
the
dissent
made
this...
made
this
point
about
the
relationship
between
retaliation
and
the
primary
right.
the
dissent
indicated
that
the
primary
right
is
being
protected
by
the
retaliation
provision,
that
without
the
retaliation
provision,
the
primary
right
could
be
impeded,
inhibited,
and
prevented
from
individuals
having
access
to
the
remedial
mechanisms.
it
doesn't
take
much
to
intimidate
an
individual
from
filing
a
claim
of
discrimination
if
they
have
an
economic
interest.
it
takes
much,
much
less
to
intimidate
a
witness
to
come
and
testify
when
they
have
no
basis.
what
704
was
aimed
at
was
allowing
the
law
enforcement
agency
here,
the
eeoc,
to
have
access
to
complaints
about
discrimination
and
witnesses,
allowing
the
courts
to
have
access
to
complaints
and
witnesses
because
without
that
free
access
and
without
704
acting
as
a
guardian
around
the
primary
rights,
the
primary
rights
would
be
eviscerated.
this
is
a
perfect
example
of...
of
a
case
where
that's
the
situation.
you
have
a...
a
woman
here
who
did
exactly
what
this
court
asked
her
to
do
in
ellerth.
she
complained
internally
about
sexual
harassment.
she
was
hired
because
of
her
forklift
responsibilities.
she
was
immediately
put
on
the
forklift.
she
performed
for
90
days
competently
as
a
forklift
operator.
no
complaints
about
what
she
did.
because
she
complained
about
sexual
harassment,
the
jury
found,
and
correctly,
she
was
removed
from
the
forklift.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
no.
until
there
is
some
use
of
official
authority
that
affects
that
individual,
you're
not
discriminating.
that's
a...
that's
a
personal
matter
between
you
and
the
individual.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
if
it's...
if
it's
a
blue
collar
worker
and
it's...
it's
not
part
of
their
responsibility
and
they
sometimes
eat
together
in
the
lunchroom
or
not,
that
would
not
be.
however,
if
it
is
a--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--no--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--there
are
situations
where
it
would
be
broader
than
703.
704
would
be
broader.
an
example.
if
a
ceo
of
a
company
came
up
to
an
african
american
male
and
punched
him
because
he's
black,
that
would
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
hostile
work
environment
under
your
test.
it
wouldn't
alter
that
individual's
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
however,
if
the
ceo
came
up
to
an
individual
who
had
filed
a
charge
of
discrimination...
of
discrimination,
and
said,
i
don't
like
you
filing
charges
of
discrimination,
and
pushed
that
individual,
that
would
have
the
effect
of
impeding
individuals
from
complaining.
and
that's...
that's
a
situation
that's
different
because
congress
anticipated
that...
that
retaliation
is
only
as
varied
as
the
human
imagination.
congress
could
have
easily--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--your
honor--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--there
are
several
things
that
are
built
into
the
statute.
first
is
701(b).
it
has
to
be
an
act
of
the
employer,
and
those
trivial
matters--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--plus,
you
always
have
to
show
causation,
and
many,
many
cases
are
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
summary
judgment,
even
termination
cases
on
the
basis
of
causation.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
your
honor,
both
the
eeoc
test,
as
well
as
our
test,
is
one
based
upon
a
reasonable
person
under
all
of
the
circumstances.
and...
and
the
trial
courts
frequently
say
under
this
set
of--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--under
our
standard,
it
would
be--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--adverse.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
if
it
was...
if
it
was
unfavorable
to
the
plaintiff.
on
the
eeoc
standard,
it
would
be
if
it
deterred
an
individual
from
filing
a
charge.
and,
justice
scalia,
we
have
cited
favorably
the
eeoc
standard.
what
we
were
asked
to
do
here--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--that's
why
we
proposed
one
that's
based
with
what
the
statute
means.
and...
and
the
statute
is
very
clear.
the
plain
language
is
unambiguous.
that's
our
first
test,
which
is
unfavorable
to
the
employee
based
upon
an
objective
standard.
but
if
the
court
felt
it
necessary
to...
to
back
to
a
position
that
was
not
quite
so
expansive,
the
eeoc
standard
is...
is
the
one
that's
most
rational
because
it's
based
in
the
purpose
of
704(a).
mr.
donald
a.
donati
justice
ginsburg,
you're
exactly
correct.
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
issue
about
how
expansive
704
is
here.
you
can
affirm
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
based
upon
the
material
adverse
employment
action
standard
that
they
articulated,
that
was
litigated
below,
that
the
defendant
did
not
object
to,
and
which
we
won
on.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
answer
one
question
related
to
that.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
did
not
cover
the
forklift.
that's
in
the
trial
transcript
on
page
524.
it
was
a
new
position
it
was
not
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining.
so
they--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--it
was
not
a
defined
job
within
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
if
you
look
at
the...
the
job
title,
which
is
part
of
the
joint
appendix,
forklift
is
not
mentioned,
and
it
was
not
part
of
that.
but
to
answer
your
question
specifically
with
respect
to
these
facts,
the...
in
this
case
here,
she
was
discharged.
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
rule
91(b)...
and
that's
found
at
page
54
and
55
of...
i'm
sorry.
55
of
the
joint
appendix.
this
is
the
rule
under
which
she
requested
the,
quote,
investigation.
by
its
very
terms,
it
doesn't
even
apply
until
an
employee
is,
quote,
disciplined
or,
quote,
dismissed.
she
was
dismissed
when
she
was
removed
from
service.
then
she
asked
for
a
hearing
under
subpart
(b),
and
she
was
given
an
investigation.
this
court,
in
its
jurisprudence
dealing
with
statute
of
limitations,
said
in
the
morgan
case
that
an
act
of
discrimination
occurs
when
it
happens.
well,
when
she
was
happened...
when
this
happened,
she
lost
pay,
she
lost
benefits.
she
was
terminated.
even...
even
their
own
witness,
roadmaster
brown,
testified
had
she
not
asked
for
an
appeal,
she
was
terminated.
so
it
was
a
discrete
act
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
well,
under
these
facts,
it
was
sufficiently
adverse
because
she
lost
pay.
now,
in
a...
in
a
theoretical
sense,
if
she
had
not
lost
pay,
that
still
could
be
adverse
under
704(a).
it
depends
upon
the
effect
and
the
motive.
i
don't
think
that
anyone
would
quarrel
under
703
if
an
african
american
was
suspended
without
pay
because
of
race,
that
that
would
be
actionable.
why
would
it
not
be
actionable
in
this
context?
there's
a
difference
between
damages
and
whether
or
not
there's
actionability
under
this
one
little
part
of...
of
the
claim.
perhaps
if
she
was...
was
suspended
for
a
retaliatory
motive
and
5
days
later
she
was
returned,
she
may
have
no
damages,
and...
and
the
claim
might...
but
in
terms
of--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--well,
assuming
that
you
could
get
through
the
hurdles.
and
i
don't
think
punitive
damages
would
necessarily
sound
there.
in
the
kolstad
case,
the
court
indicated
one
factor
to
consider
would
be
how
quickly
the...
the
defendant
corrected
the
situation.
i
mean,
if
you
have
a...
if
there's
a
legitimate
process
that's...
that's
available
and
a
supervisor
who
has
authority
to
suspend
does
that
for
a
retaliatory
motive
and...
and
that
process
corrects
it,
it
may
be
a
factor
in
punitives,
but
it's
not
a
factor
whether
a...
an
act
has
been
taken
because
the
act
is
a
discrete
act.
it
caused
her
to
lose
compensation
and...
and
to
lose
benefits.
so
it
could
affect
the
punitive
damages.
now,
with
respect
to
the...
the
statutory
construction...
well,
let
me
address
the...
the
forklift
issue
just
a...
a
little
bit
further.
if
you
take
the
position
that
the...
the
petitioner
has
here,
ms.
white...
it's
a
jury
finding.
their
witnesses
testified...
went
from
the
most
easy
or
one
of
the
most
easy
positions
to
the
most
difficult
position
because
she
complained
about
sexual
harassment.
that's
the
finding
of
fact.
they
don't
dispute
the
findings
of
fact.
so
if...
if
he's
correct,
tomorrow,
if
his...
his
position
is
affirmed,
they
could
tell
everyone
who
complains
about
sexual
harassment,
that
if
you
do
that,
we're
going
to
transfer
you
to
the
most
difficult
position
in
the
company.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
your
honor,
if...
if
you
look
at...
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
63,
the
trial
judge
actually
instructed
the
court...
instructed
the
jury,
listing
six
factors.
those
six
factors
are
listed
in
a
footnote
in
ellerth,
which
you
cite
favorably
as
what
the
standard
is...
or
what
the
standard
is
for
vicarious
liability.
so
the
court...
the
jury
was
instructed
on
material
adverse
employment
action
standard.
it
was
tried
on
the
material
adverse
employment
action
standard.
i
argued
that
the
forklift
position
was
materially
adverse.
the
defendant,
if
you
look
at
the
transcript
of
the
closing
at
pages
48
and
49,
didn't
even
challenge
that
it
was
adverse.
everybody
that
heard
the
proof,
common
sense
told
you
that
when
you
went
from
a
forklift
running
things
around
to
pulling
out
railroad
ties,
it
was
adverse.
so
to
answer
your
question,
justice
scalia,
we
traveled
all
the
way
up
to
this
court
on
the
material
adverse
employment
action
standard,
and
we
won.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
that's
a
great
question,
and
we--
[laughter]
--and
we...
we
truly
struggled
with
that.
we
found
nothing
in
the
statute,
the
text
of
the
statute
to
say
material.
where
it
uses
adverse,
at...
at
section
703(a)(2),
it
uses
the
term
adverse,
but
it
doesn't
use
it
with
the
term
material.
and--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--i
don't
think
it
does
anything
other
than
that.
it
could
also
be
interpreted
as...
as
this
court
said
in
the...
in
the
wrigley
case
involving
interpretation
of
statutes,
that
there's
a
de
minimis
rule.
it
could...
it
could
also
be
applied
that
way,
that
every...
every
statute...
there's
a...
that...
that
construction
applies
some
de
minimis
level
view.
but
in
terms
of
this
case,
this
was
definitely
material.
i
mean,
it
was
substantial
injury,
substantial
action
to...
to
ms.
white.
but
with
respect
to
the
forklift,
their
witnesses
testified...
and
we
cite
at
pages
2
and
3
of
the
brief...
that
they
considered
it
easier.
the
supervisor,
mr.
brown,
testified
that
the
men
considered
it
easier.
and
it
clearly
was.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
that
probably
would
not...
i
probably
could
not
convince
a
jury
that
that
was
materially
adverse.
but--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--i
acknowledge
and
the
facts...
and
the
sixth
circuit
unanimously
affirmed
that...
that
the
facts
were
there.
and
i
could...
i
could
go
on
for
30
minutes
about
the
facts,
and
they're...
they're
contained
in
the
first--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--yes.
you
know,
i
would
like
to
address
two
things
that
have
been
mixed.
apples
and
oranges
have
been
mixed
here
about
tangible
employment
action,
and
that's
the
standard
this
court
has
adopted.
what
the
court
did
in
ellerth
was
apply
the
rules
of
vicarious
liability
in
a
discrete
set
of...
of
cases,
harassment
cases.
harassment
cases
arise
out
of
the
word
condition.
as
you
indicated,
sexual
harassment
has
to
alter
the
condition,
and
it
has
to
be
severe
or
pervasive.
and
what
the...
the
petitioner
is...
is
saying
is
that
because
of
your
application
of
tangible
employment
action
to
vicarious
liability,
that
you
really
defined
what
constitutes
discrimination.
well,
that's
not
what
the...
the
ruling
was.
you
were
strictly
limited
to
whether
instances
of
vicarious
liability,
when...
when
employers
will
be
found
liable.
at
the
outset,
that
needs
to
be,
i
think,
clarified
that
it
was
not
a
finding
of
what
constitutes
discrimination.
and
with
respect
to
also
the
ellerth
situation,
any
test
that
this
court
adopts
should
not
be
a
per
se
test
where
some
things
are
per
se
legal,
because
when
you
say
that
an
act
of
retaliation
is
per
se
legal,
it
provides
safe
harbor
for
people
to
do
things
to
individuals.
most
employers
are--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--that's--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--that's
correct,
a
very
tough
standard.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
exactly
right.
and
i
find...
and
i
find
myself,
justice
breyer,
here
sort
of
arguing
against
the
standard
that
i
won
under.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
and
i
don't
care
what
standard
it
is.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
i
don't
care
what
the
standard
is
for
this
case.
but
if
you
adopt
a...
a
standard
that
is...
is
broad...
or
you
have
to
adopt
a
national
standard
or...
and
you
don't
have
to
here.
you
don't
have
to
make
these...
make
these
findings.
but
if
you
do
and
you
adopt
a
material
adverse
employment
action
standard,
there
always
needs
to
be
a
provision
that
prevents
per
se
rules
because...
and
in
the
sixth
circuit,
they
talk
about
unique
circumstances.
some
other
circuits
talk
about
unusual
or
exceptional
circumstances
because
if
you...
if
you
black
letter
something,
that
this
is
legal
retaliation,
employers
who
want
to
will
engage
in
that
process.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
justice
scalia,
every
claim
would
not
be
a
jury
trial
because
you're
going
to
have
to
show
the
causation
issues
and
damages
issues.
and--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
i
want--
mr.
donald
a.
donati
--well,
the...
the
rule
that
you
could
apply
that
would
not
have
per
se
rules
and
would
ferret
out
any
kind
of...
of
trivial
matters
would
be
the
eeoc
standard
with
a
de
minimis
rule.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
yes,
your
honor.
under
the
ultimate
employment
action
standard
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the...
the
suspension
would
be
in
question.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
the
court
should
find
that
that's
not
applicable
and
it's
not
appropriate
under
title
vii
and...
and
that
would
be
necessary
for
us
to
prevail,
even
though
the
defendant
did
not
argue
ultimate
employment
action
standard
at
the
trial
level,
didn't
ask
for
such
an
instruction,
didn't
raise
that
issue
until
subsequent
to
the...
this.
but
you're
correct.
we
would
need
the
court
to
say
that
that
does
not
apply.
and
then
one
other
issue
about...
about
bright
line
rules.
i
advise
and
many
lawyers
advise
women
every
day
that
complain
about
sexual
harassment.
and
mr.
phillips
is
absolutely
correct.
there
has
been
a
rise
in
retaliation
claims.
and,
of
course,
it's
complex
what
the
reasons
are,
but
anecdotally
i
can
tell
you
a
lot
of
it
sits
at
the
foot
of
ellerth
because
employers
establish
policies,
they
publish
their
policies,
they
educated
women
and
men
about
those
policies.
people
use
those
policies,
and
women
who
complain
about
sexual
harassment,
such
as
ms.
white,
internally
and
then
are
retaliated
against,
when
they
go
to
the
eeoc,
they
file
a
retaliation
claim.
and
there's
been
an
increase
of
those
claims.
but
if
this
court
applies
a
black
line
rule,
a
per
se
rule,
where
you
say
something
is
legal,
that
you
can
do
what
you
did
to
ms.
white,
then
i'll
have
to
advise
individuals
to
go
to
the
eeoc.
there
might
be
some
retaliation
and
it's
legal.
and
a
woman
placed
in
a
situation
like
that
will
not
complain
about
sexual
harassment.
and
the
protection,
the
guardian
that
rule...
that
704(a)
has
around
the
primary
right
will
be
eliminated,
and
the
primary
right
will
be
adversely
affected
because
women
will
no
longer
complain.
so
whatever
rule
you
apply,
don't
apply
a
black
letter,
per
se
rule
because
you're
going
to
cause
serious
harm
to
the
underlying
primary
rights.
if
there
are
no
more
questions.
mr.
donald
a.
donati
thank
you.
