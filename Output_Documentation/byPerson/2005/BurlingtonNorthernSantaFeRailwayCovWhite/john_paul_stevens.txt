may
i
ask
you
this
hypothetical?
supposing
people
like
to
work
the
forklift,
but
nobody
had
a...
a
right
to
do
it,
but
they
traded
every
day
or
something
like
that,
and
the
company
put
out
a
notice
that
said
anybody
who...
who
files
a
claim
will
not
be
eligible
to
ride
on
the
forklift
ever
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
a
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
anytime
there's
an
advance
notice
that
you
will...
there
will
be
some
kind
of
action
in
response
to
a...
a
claim,
that
would
be
retaliation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
was
not
an
adverse
job
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
did
not
amount
to...
did
not
have
any
economic
effect
on
the
employee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
a
quid
pro
quo
violation
does
not
have
to
be
an
adverse
employment
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
interpretation
requires
you
to
interpret
703
and
704
differently.
