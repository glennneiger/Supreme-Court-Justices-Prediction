justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
answer
would
be
because
congress
is
worried
that
people
won't
complain.
that's
why.
and
there
are
millions
of
ways
of
harassing
people.
they
start
issuing
a
complaint.
you
do
all
kinds
of
things.
you
freeze
them
out.
you...
you
insult
them.
you...
i
mean,
it's
easy
to
think
of
things
that
don't
rise
to
the
level
of
the...
ellerth.
so,
i
mean,
if
i...
maybe
i'm
right,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
if
i'm
right,
why
not
just
take,
say,
the
d.c.
circuit
standard?
they...
they
say
that
you
have
to
show
that
the
employer's
action
would
have
been
material,
which
means
the
action
might
well
have
dissuaded
a
reasonable
worker
from
making
or
supporting
a
charge
of
discrimination.
now,
how
about
that?
that
has
the
virtue
of
allowing
a
person
not
to
be
harassed,
et
cetera,
who
wants
to
make
a
complaint,
and
it
also
allows
the
judge
to
focus
on
the
particular
case
and
see
if
what
the
person
is
doing
is
reasonable.
it
holds
the
complainant
to
a
standard
of
reasonableness,
which
is
common
in
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
fact,
if
it
turns
out
to
be
the
power
lunch
of
all
time
and,
in
fact,
the
person
can't
be
at
the
power
lunch
because
she's
a
woman,
for
example,
and
therefore,
her
future
career
is
likely
to
take
a
real
nose
dive,
why
shouldn't
that
count
as
a
violation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
you
see,
i
can
think
of
a
million
things.
i
can't
think
literally
of
a
million,
but
it
does
seem--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
me
there
are
many,
many
possible
ways
of
really
discouraging
a
worker
from
complaining
that
are
not
quite
as
tangible
as
the
list
under
703.
so
the
d.c.
circuit...
and
i
think
even
the
sg
here,
which
seems
like
a
variation
of
the
d.c.
circuit...
much...
the
standards
seem
much...
not
as
different
as
you
might...
as
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying.
but...
but
they're...
they're
trying
to
be
a
little
vaguer
and
a
bit
broader
than
the
specific
ellerth
language
because
they
recognize
there
are
many
possible
ways
of
seriously
injuring
a
person
with
the
intent
or...
to
stop
them
from
complaining.
that
gives
effect
to
the
language
differences.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
leaves
it
up
to
case
by
case.
it
leaves
it
up
to
the
administrative
agency,
all
in
areas
where
i
frankly
don't
know
one
lunch
from
another.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
one
lunch
from
another
often,
but
the...
the
eeoc
might
and...
and
so
might
a
judge
who
hears
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the
virtue
of
their
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
not...
it's
not...
the...
the
words
of
the
statute
that
i
think
are
relevant
is
it...
is
it...
you
can't
discriminate
with
respect
to
his
compensation,
terms,
conditions,
or
privileges
of
employment.
now,
the
words
i
just
cited
are
present
in
703.
so
that's
the
substantive
offense.
those
words,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
and
others,
are
missing
in
704,
and
that
suggests
that
you
could
have
a
broader
definition
than
those
words
i
just
cited
as
to
what
counts
as
harm
flowing
from
a
discrimination.
that's
the
statutory
argument.
and
then
you
add,
there
could
be
good
reason
for
that.
these
people
typically
are
at
work
and
there
are
lots
of
subtle
forms
of
harm
and
some
not
so
subtle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'd
be
curious.
in
the...
in
the
seventh
circuit,
they
have
a
test,
i
gather,
like
the
d.c.
circuit,
which
you've
characterized
as
broader.
have
there
suddenly
be
a
flow
of
these
claims
towards
the
seventh
circuit?
is
there
any
empirical
data
that
this
concern
that
has
been
brought
up
is
empirically
present
in
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
in
thinking...
i
just
want
to
clarify
this...
that
in
the
circuit
court,
they
applied
a
pretty
tough
standard,
namely,
a
standard
that
sounds
a
lot
like
ellerth,
the
kocsis,
or
whatever
it
is?
tangible
employment
actions,
a
significant
change
in
employment
status,
hiring,
firing,
failing
to
promote,
reassignment
with
significantly
different
responsibilities,
or
a
decision
causing
a
significant
change
in
benefits.
and
that's
basically
what
the
jury
was
instructed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
won
under
the
toughest
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
a
sense,
you
have
nowhere
to
go
but
up.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
care
what
standard--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
section
703
of
the
…
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
--
that’s
the
employment
section
--
forbids
an
employer
from
discriminating
against
an
individual
because
of
race,
religion,
gender
or
national
origin
with
respect
to
“compensation,
terms,
conditions
or
privileges
of
employment”.
then
you
go
to
the
next
section,
which
is
704,
and
the
next
section
forbids
an
employer
from
discriminating
against
an
individual
because
that
individual
has
filed
a
charge
or
assisted
in
an
investigation
of
or
imposed
--
opposed
an
employer’s
discriminatory
behavior.
in
other
words
it
forbids
retaliation
when
you
complain
about
a
title
vii
violation.
now,
in
this
case,
we
consider
704,
the
anti-retaliation
provision,
and
what
we
do
is,
we
are
focusing
on
two
matters
that
the
lower
courts
have
reached
different
conclusions
about:
the
first,
we
ask,
“well,
does
that
anti-retaliation
provision
limit
the
kind
of
retaliation
it
forbids;
two,
retaliation
that
affects
terms
and
conditions
of
an
individual’s
employment;
or
does
it
contain
no
such
limitation,
does
it
go
further?”;
second,
we
ask,
”how
harmful
must
the
forbidden
retaliation
be
in
order
to
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
provision
which
prohibits
it?”
now,
as
to
the
first
question,
we
find
that
the
provision
is
not
limited
to
retaliation;
it
affects
the
terms
and
conditions
of
an
individual’s
employment.
it
goes
farther.
it
forbids
retaliation
that
affects
an
individual
outside
of
his
job,
say,
serious
harassment
in
his
home,
just
is
it
forbids
retaliation
on
the
job,
say,
a
demotion.
the
language
of
the
statute
suggests
this.
that’s
why
i
read
the
text,
because
the
text
that
i
read
that
talks
about
limitations
to
employment
is
in
the
first
part,
the
substantive
provision,
703.
no
language
like
that
is
present
in
the
second
part,
so
why
limit
it?
and
moreover,
common
sense
suggests
the
same
thing.
after
all,
a
threat
to
hurt
a
person
who
files
a
complaint
at
that
individual’s
home
or
to
file
a
false
criminal
charge
against
a
victim
of
discrimination
could
be
just
as
effective
at
stopping
her
from
filling
the
complaint
as
a
threat
to
reduce
her
pay.
so
limiting
the
anti-retaliation
to
employment-related
acts
would
fail
to
fully
achieve
the
provision’s
purpose,
which
is
to
prevent
employers
from
interfering
with
employees’
efforts
to
invoke
title
vii’s
protections.
as
to
the
second
question,
we
hold
that
the
anti-retaliation
provision
protects
an
individual
not
from
all
conceivable
retaliation,
but
from
retaliation
that
produces
a
significant
injury
or
harm.
of
course,
you
want
to
know
what's
meant
by
“significant”.
well,
we
say
what
it
means
is,
we
adopt
the
standard
that’s
been
used
by
the
7th
circuit
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuits.
they
say
and
we
say,
to
show
that
an
injury
or
harm
is
significant,
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
a
reasonable
employee
would
have
found
the
employer’s
retaliatory
action
materially
adverse,
which
in
this
context
means
that
it
well
might
have
dissuaded
a
reasonable
worker
from
making
or
supporting
a
charge
of
discrimination.
we
use
the
term
“material”
to
separate
out,
because
they
are
not
actionable,
trivial
harms.
we
refer
to
the
reactions
of
a
reasonable
person,
because
we
think
the
standard
for
judging
harm
must
be
objective,
as
it
is
in
other
title
vii
context.
we
phrase
the
standard
in
general
terms,
because
the
significance
of
any
given
retaliatory
act
will
often
depend
upon
particular
circumstances;
that
is
to
say,
context
matters.
a
worker’s
schedule
change
may
normally
make
little
difference
to
a
worker;
but
suppose
that
that
worker
is
a
young
mother
with
children,
then
it
could
matter
enormously.
a
supervisor’s
refusal
to
invite
an
employee
to
lunch
is
normally
just
a
petty
slight;
but
to
retaliate
by
excluding
an
employee
from
a
weekly
training
lunch
might
well
dissuade
a
reasonable
employee
from
coming
forward
with
a
discrimination
complaint.
finally,
we
apply
the
standard
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
plaintiff,
the
only
woman
working
as
a
railroad-track
laborer
in
the
railroad's
tennessee
yard
complained
about
sexual
harassment.
subsequently,
she
was
subject
to
a
change
of
duties.
her
duty
was
changed
from
forklift
operator
to
ordinary
track
worker.
then
she
made
some
more
complaints,
and
after
that
she
was
charged
with
insubordination
and
suspended
without
pay
for
37
days.
eventually,
the
railroad
found
her
innocent
of
insubordination
and
gave
her
back
pay.
in
our
view,
the
jury
could
lawfully
find
in
the
circumstance
that
the
reassignment
of
her
job
duties,
and
the
37-day
suspension
without
pay,
even
though
she
later
got
back
pay,
they
still
could
find
that
that
constituted
unlawful
retaliation.
we
explain
all
these
matters
more
fully
in
our
opinion.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
which
found
in
her
favor,
is
affirmed.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
