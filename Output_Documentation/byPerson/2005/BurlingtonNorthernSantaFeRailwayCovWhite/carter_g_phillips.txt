mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
there
is
no
more
vexing
set
of
issues
in
the
employment
discrimination
context
than
arise
out
of
issues
of
retaliation
under
section
704
of
title
vii.
as
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
a
couple
of
the
other
amici
briefs
point
out,
the
number
of...
the
number
of
these
claims
has
increased
by
more
than
100
percent
over
the
course
of
the
last
decade,
more
than
30
percent
of
the
eeoc's
docket
is
now
made
up
of
retaliation
claims,
and
the
cost
of
an
average
contested
retaliation
claim
exceeds
$130,000
per
case.
plainly,
this
is
a
fundamentally
important
question,
and
the
standard
to
be
applied
under
section
704
is
critically
important
to
both
employers
and
employees.
and
the
respondent
has
given
you
truly
a
choice
and
not
a
shadow
in
this
particular
case
because
the
respondent's
analysis
of
section
704,
based
essentially
on
the
language,
any
discrimination,
is
that
everything
that
is
in
any
sense
against
an
employee,
any
act
of
retaliation,
no
matter
how
trivial,
is
nevertheless
a
basis
for
a
section
704
lawsuit.
this
is
a
position
that's
embraced
by
none
of
her
supporting
amici.
it's
a
position
that's
been
embraced
by
no
court
of
appeals
up
until
this
point,
and
it
is
a
position
that
is
utterly
untethered
in
the
relationship
between
section
704
and
its
language
and
section
703,
which
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
antidiscrimination
norms
in
title
vii.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not...
not
that
broad...
no,
not
even
the
eeoc
in
its
most
aggressive
interpretation,
which
obviously
the
united
states
has
rejected
in
this
case,
ever
went
to
the
point
of
saying
any.
and
i'll
give
you
a
good
illustration
of
that
because
in
the
guidelines,
the
commission
always
said
that
in
a
situation
where
there
was
absolutely
no
question
of
retaliation,
charge
filed
against
a
supervisor,
supervisor
disinvites
an
employee
to
lunch,
a
lunch
that's
held
with
all
the
other
employees...
it
has
always
been
the
position
of
the...
of
the
eeoc
that
in
that
circumstance,
that
would
not
be
enough
to
raise
even
a
fact
issue
to
go
to
a
jury
on.
under
the
respondent's
theory
of
this
case,
it
is
clear
to
me
that
being
disinvited
to
a
lunch
would,
in
fact,
be
a
basis
for
a
federal
lawsuit
under
section
704.
so
there
is
no
one,
neither
governmental
nor
nongovernmental,
that
has
embraced
the
extreme
position
that
the
respondent
has
put
forward
under
section
704.
and
indeed,
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand
why
congress
would
ever
have
adopted
a
rule
that
was
more
protective
of
those
against
whom...
against...
where
retaliation
takes
place
as
opposed
to
the
core
of
who
was
protected
by
section
703,
which
is
the
people
who
are
in
the
protected
class
in
the
first
instance.
to
adopt
the
rule,
i
think,
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
would
not
only
increase
the
number
of
claims
another
100
percent,
at
least,
in
the
future,
but
it
seems
to
me
would
render
completely
meaningless
the
observation
of
this
court
in
weber
that
management
prerogatives
are
to
be
left
undisturbed
to
the
greatest
extent
possible.
there
are
no
management
prerogatives
once
an
employee
has
filed
a
complaint
under...
and,
therefore,
is
protected
under
section
704.
at
that
point,
everything
becomes
essentially
a
straitjacket
problem.
i
don't
think
there's
a
rationale
to
support
that
interpretation,
and
so
therefore
the
question
is,
what
is
the
right
standard
under
section
704?
and
here,
it
seems
to
me
the
united
states
and
burlington
northern
are
on
exactly
the
same
page.
we
believe
that
this
court
announced
the
appropriate
standard
under
section
703
in
dealing
with
harassment
cases.
that's
the
ellerth
standard,
and
we
believe
that
the
ellerth
standard
is
the
proper
one
for
defining
a
tangible
employment
action.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
justice
scalia,
this
court
has
also
said
that
that
negative
pregnant
has
never
been
used
as
an
overarching
interpretive
guide.
you
have
to
evaluate
703
and
704
in
tandem,
and
it
seems
much
easier
to
interpret
704
as
simply
using
discrimination
against
as
a
shorthand
for
the
wide
range
of
discriminations
that
are
outlined
in
703.
it
seems
quite
cumbersome,
at
a
minimum,
and
probably
worse
if
congress
were
to
actually
sit
down
and
try
to
rewrite
every
aspect
of
703
in
order
simply
to
say
in
addition
to
the
protected
classes
that
703
protects,
there
is
certain
conduct
under
704
that
we
protect
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
we
protect--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--they
could
have
said
it
that
way,
but
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
congress
still
intended
for
703
and
704
to
be
interpreted
in
pari
materia.
and...
and
again,
you...
you
still
run
into
the
same
problem,
justice
scalia,
as
to
why
is
it
that
congress
would
want
to
protect
more
thoroughly
704
plaintiffs
than
it
would
703
plaintiffs.
and
it
seems
to
me
there's
no--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
would
be...
that
would
be
the
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
will
tell
you,
justice
breyer,
that
the...
at
least
one
of
the
problems
with
that
is
that
the
eeoc's
guidelines
expressly
state
that
that
is
not
a
claim
that's
actionable
under
section
704.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
would
fit
under
the
eeoc's
definition,
although
i
don't
think
it's
an
answer
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
was
talking
the
big
power
lunch.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
not
under
my...
no,
that's
not
necessarily
the
case,
justice
ginsburg.
in
my...
you
know,
there
are
two
standards
under...
under
an
adverse
employment
action.
the
first
one
is
whether
there's
a
tangible
action,
and
that's
the
ellerth
standard.
and
then
there's
always
the
pervasive
and
severe
standard,
so
that
if
you
have...
you
know,
being
routinely
excluded
rises
to
the
level
of
pervasive
or
severe,
that
would
still
be
actionable
under
704
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
that's
actionable
under
703.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and...
and
does
it
on
a
pervasive
basis,
sustained
and
pervasive
basis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
you
probably
have
a
jury
question
at
some
point,
depending
on
how
long
it
went
on
for
because
it
would
become...
it
would
become
a
pervasive
practice.
and
under
those
circumstances,
this
court
has
a
rule
that
allows
that
to
become
a
jury
issue.
but
if
it's
only
once
or
twice,
it
strikes
me
that
that's
not
a
particular
problem.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the...
the
reason
why
that's
not
a
problem
is
that
there
is
no
economic
effect
that
attaches
to
not
working
on
the
forklift
for
a
year
or
for
10
years.
the...
the
proof
in
this
case
is
absolutely
clear.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
was
not
the...
but
the...
but
she
didn't
get
hired
as
a
forklift
operator.
she
was
hired
as
a
track
laborer,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there's...
there's
no
question
that
there's
a
jury
finding
of
retaliation.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
tangible
employment
action.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
souter,
let
me...
in
the
first
place,
it's
not
a
very
practical
hypothetical
because,
one,
when
you...
when
you
define
your
job
positions--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
one,
she
wasn't
typically
picking
up
steel
rails
with
her
bare
hands.
all
of
this
stuff
is
done
mechanically.
she
was
pulling
nails
out
of
rails
periodically.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
precisely
the
way
to
characterize
it.
but
the...
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
still
seems
to
me
that
what
ellerth
tells
you
you
should
look
at
is
primarily
whether
there
is
a...
a
direct
economic
effect.
and
if
there
is
no
direct
economic
effect,
then
what
you
ought
to
be
looking
for
is
whether
or
not
the...
the
conduct
is
severe
or
pervasive,
and...
and
if
it
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--then,
it
seems
to
me,
there's
a
separate
action.
but
that's
not
the
claim
she
brought
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
the
only
criterion.
i
think
that
you
would
have
a
situation...
and
a
lot
of
times
the...
the
economic
effect
will
be
either
immediate
or
potentially
indirect
in
the
sense
of
the
hypothetical
the
commission
uses
in
its
guidelines
where
a
butcher
is
shifted
over
to
be
a
cashier.
and
in
that
situation,
that's
a
fundamentally
different
job
with
a
fundamentally
different
career
path.
and
it
may
not
have
any
economic
effects
in
the
short
run,
but
in
the
long
run,
it
will
have.
and
that
may
be
an
answer
in
part
to
your
question,
justice
souter,
about
just
one
big
job
classification
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
that's
a
quid
pro
quo
violation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
this
court
held
in...
in
ellerth
that
those
kinds
of
quid
pro
quos
are...
are
subject
to
liability.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
because
the
employer...
i
mean,
employers
aren't
going
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--adopt
that
kind
of
a
standard.
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
in
that...
you
know,
in...
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
standard
is
slightly
different
for
quid
pro
quo
violations
than
they
are
for
simply
tangible
employment
actions.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it...
right,
because
the...
there
are...
i
mean,
they
are
all
adverse
employment
actions.
there's
a
tangible
employment
action.
there's
a
quid
pro
quo
action,
and
then
there's
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
i...
i
don't
believe
so
because
i'm...
i'm...
what
i'm
trying
to
do
at
least
is
to
apply
the
ellerth
standard
under
703
for
each
of
the
three
elements
in
the
same
way
that
i'm
trying
to
apply
them
under
704.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
that
if...
if
you
could
certainly
envision
a
circumstance...
and
again,
this
goes
to
the
pervasiveness
of
it.
it's...
it's
a
fundamental,
sort
of
constructive
adjustment
of
your
employment
situation.
terms
and
conditions
is
a
fairly
capacious
term,
justice
scalia,
and
i
could
well
imagine
that
if
you
were
being
systematically
treated
differently
and
differently
from
every
other
employee--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--then
at
some
point
it
becomes
severe
or
pervasive
in
a
way
that...
that,
it
would
seem
to
me,
would
raise
a
jury
trial
issue.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
going
to
lunch
once,
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
going
to
lunch
twice,
i'm
sure
not.
but,
you
know,
if
it
is
a
continuous
process,
at
some
point
it
strikes
me
that
it
would
become
somewhat
problematic.
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
and
that
is
why
it's
important,
and
it
goes
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
if
i
can
go
back
to
that
for
a
second,
because
he
asked
about
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion,
which,
you
know,
of
course,
adopted
the
eeoc's
now
discredited
theory
of
this
case
and,
again,
untethers
703
from
704.
that's
the
problem
with
the
d.c.
circuit's
interpretation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
suspect
you
could.
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
mean,
you
can
ask
mr.
garre
what
his
view
is
with
respect
to
the
waiting
on
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
here.
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
way
the
d.c.
circuit
is
analyzing
this
case
and...
and
the
way
this
court
analyzed
it
ellerth.
and
the
fundamental
difference
is...
i
agree
with
you.
there
are
other
circumstances
that
are
not
tangible
employment
actions
that
are,
nevertheless,
actionable
under
both
703
and
704,
but
those
are...
those
are
taken
care
of
under
the
meritor
standards.
the...
the
assumption
is
that
they
are
both
retaliatory
in
purpose
and
that
they
are
severe
or
pervasive.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
when
you
reach
that
standard,
then
you
create
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
doubt
it
actually,
justice
ginsburg,
because
i
think
typically
mere
inconveniences,
even...
even
significant
inconveniences,
have
traditionally
been
rejected
as
bases
for
taking
an
issue
to
the
jury.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
ginsburg,
every
one
of
these
cases
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
only
reason
it
was
done
is
because
of
retaliation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
lunch
is
in
exactly
the
same
position.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so
that
can't
be
the
standard.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
ginsburg,
if
you
adopt
the
other
approach,
what
you
say
is
that
every
change
in
assignments
within
the
ordinary
course
of
business
is
subject
to
claim
by
a
plaintiff--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
any
situation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--where
he
or
she
thinks
she's
been
retaliated
against.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and...
and
again,
the
problem
with
that
legal
standard,
justice
ginsburg,
is
it
is
not
the
same
one
that
applies
under
section
703,
and
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
reason
to
provide
greater
protections
under
704
to
plaintiffs
than
you
would
have
under
section
703.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
pervasive.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
to
be
sure,
that's
a
possibility...
that's
a
possible
answer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
it
could
be
severe
enough.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
the
question
is,
is
it
severe,
i
think,
to
that
person?
i
think
that
is
the
meritor
standard,
is,
is
it
severe
to
the
individual
plaintiff?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
that's
because
that's
the
tangible
employment
aspect
of
it.
justice
scalia
says
you're
right
about...
well,
i
don't
know
if
he
said
i'm
right
about
the
tangible...
tangible
employment
aspect
of
it.
but
he
says,
you
know,
as
you
recognize,
there
is
a
second
category
of
claims,
and
the
second
category
of
claims
is
the
meritor
standard,
which
i've
been
arguing
for.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it...
it
probably
depends
on
whether
or
not
it
was
the
expectation
of
the...
of
the
employee
that...
that
he
or
she
would
have
a
certain
set
of
hours,
because
an
awful
lot
of
employees
take
a
job
with
the
expectation
that
they'll
work
any
hours.
now,
you
may
get
into
a
particular
pattern
and...
and
even
set
yourself
up
for
that,
but
if...
if
the
expectation
is
that
you
were
going
to
work
potentially
24
hours
and
you
shift
from
one
set
to
another,
that
i
don't
think
is
a
change
in
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
within
the
meaning
of
703.
if
i
could
just
shift
slightly
to
the
suspension,
pending
investigation,
part
of
the
case.
and
there
are
two
parts,
and
it's
important
to
recognize
that
if
the
court
sets
aside
either
one
of
those
claims,
then
we're
entitled
to
a
new
trial
because
the
damages
flow
directly
from
both
and
there
was
no
specific...
there
was
no
special
verdict
in
this
case
to
identify
what...
where
the
damages
come
from.
and
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
suspension,
pending
investigation,
is
that
there
was
simply
no
final
action
taken
by
the
employer
in
this
context
until
15
days
later.
she
was
suspended
for
insubordination
by
her
supervisor.
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
all
she
had
to
do
was
send
in
a
letter.
if
she
didn't
want
to
send
in
a
letter,
the...
the
decision
would
become
final
and
there
would
be
final
action
that's
clearly
subject
to
a
claim
under
section
704.
she
did
send
in
a
letter.
there
was
an
informal
investigation.
the
informal
investigation
concluded
that
there
was
no
basis
for
suspending
her
for
insubordination,
and
she
was
reinstated
with
complete
back
pay.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
except
that
it
was
all...
it
was...
it
was
reinstated.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
official
action.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
then
the
question
still
remains,
justice
scalia,
for
it
to
be
a
tangible
employment
action,
is
it...
is
it
available
to
the
employer
to
cure,
when
the
purpose
of
this
entire
statutory
scheme
is
to
avoid
litigation
and
to
provide
informal
mechanisms
for
protecting
the
rights
of
the
employee.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
ginsburg,
there
still
remains
the
core
question
of
whether
this
is
a
tangible
employment
action.
it's
not
a
long
term
action.
it's
not
an
economic
effect,
and
the
fact
of...
of
anxiety...
that
happens
all
the
time
in
the
work
place.
it's
not
actionable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
she
did
something
about
it,
and
it
was
corrected,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
sure.
and
the
question
is,
can
you
cure
it?
and
that's
the
fundamental
issue
we
ask
you
to
decide.
can
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
begin
by
focusing
on
the
jury
instruction
in
this
case.
the
jury
was
not
instructed
with
the
ellerth
standard.
there's
a
variant
of
the
ellerth
standard,
and
it
was
not
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ellerth
standard.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
in
the
sixth
circuit
there
is
a
unique
circumstances
standard
that
arises
out
of
its
particular
way
of
analyzing
these
issues,
and
under
that
standard,
it
could
be
upheld.
and
that
was
the
same
basis
on
which
the
district
court
at
pet.
app.
118a
upheld
this
particular
verdict.
so
the
question
of
the
right
standard
to
be
applied
and
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
it
under
these
circumstances,
justice
scalia,
is
clearly
presented
in
this
case,
and
it's
an
issue
that
this
court
still
has
to
decide.
second,
with
respect
to
the
suspension,
the...
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
specifically
provides
for
discipline
and
then
15
days.
it's
not
a
final
decision.
there's
nothing
in
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
says
it's
a
decision
of
the
employer.
to
the
contrary,
the
decision
at
the
end
of
the...
of
the
investigation
is
the
decision
of
the
carrier.
and
we
don't
need
a
final
employer
action
standard
in
order
to
prevail
on
this.
what
we
need
is
the
opportunity
to
cure
and
a
reasonable
way
under...
under
section
704,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
held
specifically
in
taylor.
and
then
finally,
with
respect
to
the
observation
about,
you
know,
don't
make
any
per
se
rules,
well,
the
truth
is
there
aren't
going
to
be
any
per
se
rules.
there
will
be
a
lot
of
cases
that
get
dismissed
out
under
a
tangible
employment
action
theory
because
there
aren't
tangible
employment
actions.
but
there
will
always
be
available
the
severe
and...
and
pervasive
standard,
which
is
always
going
to
constrain
any
employer
from...
from
adopting
those
kinds
of
policies.
and
the
point
that
counsel
made
is
that
he
recommends
to
every
one
of
his
employees...
he
probably
should
recommend
two
things.
one,
you
show
up.
you
ought
to
file
a
complaint
about
discrimination
in
the
work
place
because
under
his
approach,
you
will,
therefore,
be
super
protected
under
section
704
in
a
way
you
wouldn't
have
been
by
merely
being
protected
under
703.
that
cannot
possibly
be
what
congress
intended
or
what
is
helpful
for
the
work
place.
the
court
should
reject
that
approach,
should
reject
the
sixth
circuit's
view,
and
remand.
thank
you,
your
honors.
