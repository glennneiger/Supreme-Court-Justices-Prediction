mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
because
title
vii
prohibits
an
employer
from
suspending
an
employee
for
37
days
without
pay
because
of
her
sex
or
from
reassigning
her
from
one
responsibility
that's
material
different...
materially
different
than
another
responsibility
because
of
her
sex,
it
prohibits
an
employer
from
doing
so
because
she
filed
an
eeoc
charge
complaining
about
discrimination.
title
vii's
antiretaliation
provision
creates
an
additional
basis
for
unlawful
discrimination,
but
it
does
not
create
a
different
or
more
expansive
concept
of
discrimination
in
the
statute's
core
prohibitions.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
the
problem
that
justice
souter
identified,
i
believe,
where
an
employer
or
even
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
could
identify
categories
that
had
so
many
different
responsibilities--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--here,
what
we
know
and
what
the
jury
found...
and
this
is
actually...
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind.
this
is
a
jury
finding.
the
jury
was
instructed
properly
on
what
would
constitute
a
material
adverse
employment
action.
the
instruction
is
at
page
63
and
64
of
the
joint
appendix.
one
of
the
conditions
that
a
jury
could
find
an
adverse
action
based
on
was
a
materially
significant
change
in
responsibilities.
the
jury
heard
evidence
on
the
different
types
of
responsibilities
that
the
respondent
performed,
and
it
concluded
that
being
changed,
being
reassigned
after
3
months
of
working
the
forklift,
to
manually
repairing
railroad
track
was
a
materially
significant
change
in
responsibilities.
that's
the
language
that
comes
from
this--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
would
be
ultimately
a
jury
question
in
this
particular
category
of
claims.
as...
if...
if
it
were
the
case
that
employees
typically
worked
the
forklift
and
then
the
next
day
worked
the...
worked
the
track,
then
the
next
day
did
something
else,
then
i
don't
think
a
jury
could
find
that
there
was
a
material...
materially
significant
change
in
responsibilities.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
that...
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
right.
and...
and
if...
if
employees
were
shifted
around
for
one
reason
or
the
other,
then
i
still
think
it
would
be
unlikely
to
be
a
material
change
in
their
responsibilities
when
they
went--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
was
testimony
to
that
effect,
justice
ginsburg.
also,
when...
when
respondent
was
hired,
they
had
just
lost
their
existing
forklift
operator,
someone
who
had
done
that.
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
the
evidence
will
permit
a
court,
if
it
agrees
that
material
adverse
employment
action
is
the
test,
to
overturn
the
jury's
finding
that
the
change
here
was
materially
adverse.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
most
courts
have
held
that
where
you
have
suspension
with
pay,
then
you
don't
have
material
adverse
employment
action.
now,
at
some
level,
if
the
suspension
is
so
long,
6
months,
a
year,
then
effectively
you
could
have
a
different
type
of
material
adverse
action,
but
where
it's
a
2-week
suspension
to
investigate,
that
would
not
be
material
adverse
action.
in
fact,
as...
as
the
afl
cio
amicus
brief
points
out,
i
think,
that's
the
favored
practice
in
the
industry.
now,
we...
we
do
think
that
with
respect
to
the
standard,
that
as
this
court
recognized
in
faragher,
it
makes
good
sense
to
harmonize
discrimination
standards.
and
here,
we
think
that
congress
intended
the
courts
to
harmonize
the
standard
for
section
704,
the
anti
retaliation
provision,
with
the
standard
for
section
03,
the
act's
core
prohibitions.
justice
scalia,
it
does...
the
section
704
does
omit
the
phrase,
terms,
conditions
of
employment,
but
as
we've
explained
in
our
brief,
we
think
it
is
reasonable
to
read
the
discriminate
against
as
a
shorthand
for
the
unlawful
employment
practices
identified
in
section
703.
it's
also
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
congress
knows
how
to
write
a
broader
antiretaliation
statute
when
it
wants
to.
look
at
the
ada,
the
family
medical
leave
act.
these
are
statutes
which,
by
their
terms,
prohibit
employers
from
any
attempt
to
intimidate,
coerce,
threaten,
or
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
rights.
look
at
the
family
medical
leave
act--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--with
respect,
what
i'm
telling
you
is
that
congress
has
determined
in
some
areas
it
may
be
important
to
have
a
broader
provision
protecting
against
intimidation
and
coercion.
i
mean,
if
the
court
interprets
discriminate
against
to
include
all
that
kind
of
conduct,
then
it
renders
those
provisions
redundant.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
does,
justice
ginsburg.
as
the
government
explained
in
its
brief
in
the
robinson
case,
post
employment
references
are
reasonably
viewed
as
a
term,
condition,
or
privilege
of
employment
because
it's
routine
for
employees
to
request
them
and
routine
for
employers
to
provide
them.
now,
if
i
could
address
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
reasonably
likely
to
deter
test
that
you
referred
to,
justice
breyer.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
submission
that
the
statute
should
be
written
in
pari
materia,
then
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
that
is
the
next
best
test
to
adopt.
but...
but
the
court
should...
it
should
be
clear
to
the
court
how
much
broader
that
test
is
than
the
material
adverse
action
test.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
again,
we
think
congress
knows
how
to
write
that
statute,
and
it
does
it
differently.
it
has
a
different
provision.
for
example,
in
the
family
medical
leave
act,
not
only
included
the
coercion
and
intimidation
language,
it
also
said
in
any
manner
discriminate.
we
also
think,
again,
going
to
our
interpretation
of
discriminate
against,
it
makes
sense
to
read
that
for
a...
as
a
shorthand
for
the...
the
unlawful
practices
spelled
out
and
detailed
in
section
703.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
two...
two
points
with
respect
to
that.
first,
no,
i
don't
know
of
empirical
data
in
the
seventh
circuit.
second,
we
know
that
retaliation
charges
are...
are
rising.
they've
more
than
doubled
in
the
past
decade.
and
third,
the
seventh
circuit
test
is
essentially
like
the...
the
test
that
this
court
applies
in
the
first
amendment
context
to
determine
when
there's
retaliation.
this
court
in
the
rutan
case
observed
that
something
as
trivial
as
failing
to
hold
a
birthday
party
for
an
employee
could
satisfy
that
test.
applying
this
test
in
the
lower
courts,
courts
have
held
that
an
officer
not
being
able
to
see
his
police
dog
would
be...
could
go
to
a
jury,
that...
that
a
shunning
conduct
less
than
hostile
work
environment
could
go
to
a
jury,
that
failing
to
hold
employee
feedback
meetings
could
go
to
a
jury--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's...
that's
true.
i
mean,
at
that
point,
we
think
it
would
just
be
a
policy
decision.
again,
we
think
that
congress
made
the
policy
decision
that
the
tests
should
be
harmonized.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
possible.
that
would
be--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
think
that
the
balance
that
congress
struck
in
title
vii
was
from...
between
deterring
all
forms
of
discrimination
and
not...
not
allowing
every
employee
grievance
to
become
a
federal
court
case.
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
repeatedly
not
all
work
place
conduct
that's
offensive
or
even
harassing
violates
title
vii,
and
we
think
that
that
same
compromise
should
inform
the
court's
interpretation
of
section
704
of
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
