okay,
but
if
that
argument
is
sound--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
if
your...
if
your
argument
is
sound,
mr.
phillips,
then...
then
any
employer
is
well
advised
to
define
job
categories
by
having
one
really
nice
job
within
the
category
and
one
really
rotten
job
within
the
category.
and
if
anybody
who's
got
the
nice
job
does
something
like
make
a
title
vii
complaint,
automatically
gets,
in
effect,
reassigned
to
the
rotten
job,
and
your
answer
will
be,
you
know,
there's
no
economic
effect.
they're
getting
the
same
amount
of
money
each
week.
i
mean,
that
would
seem
to
me...
asks
for
an
end
run
around
the
whole
concept
of
retaliation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't...
isn't
there
a
big
difference
between
sitting
on
a
seat
and
running
a
forklift
and...
and
picking
up
steel
rails
with
your
bare
hands?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
but
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
direct
economic
effect
cannot
be
the
only
criterion
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
the
employer--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do...
do
you
think
it
does
anything
more
than
just
eliminate
clearly
de
minimis
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
do...
do
you
think
the...
the
materially
modifier
here
does
anything
other
than
eliminate
obviously
de
minimis
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
employer?
