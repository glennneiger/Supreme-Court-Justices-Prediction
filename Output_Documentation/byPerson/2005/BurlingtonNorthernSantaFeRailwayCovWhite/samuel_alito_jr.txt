alito,
jr.
isn't
a
change
in
the
hours
that
a
person
works
a
change
in
the
terms
and
conditions?
if
change
somebody's
shift
from
the
day
shift
to
the...
to
the
night
shift,
isn't
that
a
change
under
703?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
704
doesn't
incorporate
703
why
would
the...
the
eeoc
test
be
the
next
best
test?
if
congress...
there's
nothing
in
704
that
refers
to
the
eeoc
standard,
is
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
congress
could
have...
could
have
said...
could
have
thought
not
only
do
we
not
want
people
who...
who
file
complaints
not
to
suffer
those
things
that
would
deter
a
reasonable
person
from
filing
a
complaint,
but
we
just
don't
want
them
to
suffer
at
all
for
having
engaged
in
this
protected
activity.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what...
what
basis
would
there
be
for
deciding
that
congress
had
one
policy
objective
as
opposed
to
the
other
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
does...
what
does
material
mean?
