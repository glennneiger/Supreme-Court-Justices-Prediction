they
say
one
lunch,
but
not
if
there's
a
weekly
lunch,
and
the
only
person
who
gets
left
out
is
the
person
who
filed
a
charge
under
title
vii.
that's...
a
one
at
a
time
curiosity
the
eeoc
guidelines
leave
out,
but
if
it's
a
routine
lunch
with
all
the
preferred
employees
and
they
leave
out
the
one
who
filed
the
title
vii
charge,
that
would
fit
within
the
eeoc's
definition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wouldn't
fit
under
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--under
your
definition,
lunch
is
lunch,
and
so
there
would
never
be...
there
couldn't
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
does
it
or
doesn't
it?
the...
the
facts
are
simply
that
the
manager
takes
out
all
the
employees,
except
this
one
that
filed
the
title
vii
charge,
once
a
week.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
it
once
a
week,
and
i'm
not
using
any
adjective
to
characterize
it.
it
just
happens
once
a
week.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let's
get
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
the
seventh
circuit
case
that
posed
the
question
of
same
job,
same
character
of
work,
except
that
the
employee
had
flex
time,
which
enabled
her
to
take
care
of
her
disabled
child
when
she
could
leave
at
3:00,
and
she's
just
changed
to...
same
job
except
it's
got
to
be
9:00
to
5:00.
would
that
fit
within
your
definition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
the
jury
has
made
a
finding
that
the
only
reason
that
was
done
was
in
retaliation
for
her
having
filed
a
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
say
that's
outside--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
would
be
outside
704
if
this
is
done
deliberately
in
retaliation
for
filing
a
complaint.
just
switch
her
from
a
work
routine
that
she
could
easily
manage
and
still
take
care
of
her
family
and
to
one
that
is
impossible
for
her
to
manage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not...
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
every--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
everyone,
but
only
the
ones
that
would,
in
fact,
deter
a
reasonable
person
from
filing
the
charge.
and
that
would
not
be
every
trivial--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that...
this
is
a
peculiar
effect
on
one
person,
but
for
most
people--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--most
people
it
wouldn't
matter.
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you're
changing
your
answer.
you
originally
told
me
that,
no,
that
that
wouldn't
fit
because
it's
the
same
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
didn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
didn't
cure.
i
mean,
it
was
37
days,
right,
that
she
went
without
pay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
just
2
weeks.
and
she
understandably
experienced
much
stress
in
that
time.
she
worried
about
how
she
would
be
able
to
feed
her
children,
could
she
get
them
christmas
presents.
that
was...
there
was
nothing
that
she
got,
when
it
was
determined
that
she
hadn't
been
insubordinate,
that
compensated
her
for
that
stress
and,
indeed,
for
the
medical
expense
that
she
incurred
because
she
had
that
stress.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when...
when
somebody
is
suspended,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
as
tangible
as
it
can
get.
it
gets
registered
officially.
this
person
is
suspended,
and
if
she
doesn't
do
something
about
it,
she's
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--official
action
is...
is
different
from...
the
problem
with
ellerth
was
that
if
there's
nothing
formally
that
had
been
done,
the
employer...
this...
ellerth
was
concerned
with
vicarious
liability,
nothing
official.
there
had
been
none...
the
boss
wouldn't
know
about
it.
but
somebody
who
is
suspended,
that
is
an
official...
that's
a
tangible
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
have
been
impossible
here
because
there
was
no
one
in
that
entire
unit
who
could
operate
a
forklift
except
this
one
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
is
it...
was
it
in
this
category,
this
track
category?
because
it
was
something
new
for
the
employer.
there
hadn't
been
a
forklift
operator.
i
gather
there
had
only
been
one
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
your
test
cover
the
person
who's
a
former
employee
who
complained
under
title
vii,
wants
a
recommendation
letter,
and
isn't
given
one
for
retaliation...
as
retaliation
for
having
complained
under
title
vii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
won
on
the
basis
of
the
standard
that
the
sixth
circuit
used,
which
was
not
your
standard
and
not
the
eeoc
standard.
why
should
this
court
deal
with
anything
other
than
that
the
petitioner's
standard
is
unsatisfactory,
that
at
least
the
sixth
circuit
standard...
why
should
the
court
deal
with
the
universe
of
cases
when
it
has
this
case
before
it,
two
actions,
and
a
unanimous
sixth
circuit
judgment
that
says
these
two
actions
fall
within
704?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
don't
you
want
us
to
exclude
this
ultimate
employment
decision?
i
think
that's
one
thing.
in
order
to
win,
you
have
to
say
what
counts
is
the
suspension
and
not
the
ultimate
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
for
you
to
win
to
preserve
your
sixth
circuit
victory,
that
would
have
to
be
ruled
out.
