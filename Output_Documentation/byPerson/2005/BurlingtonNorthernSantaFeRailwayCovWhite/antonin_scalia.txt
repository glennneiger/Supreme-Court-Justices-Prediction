but
703
has
the
language
and
704
doesn't.
i
mean,
703
has
language
limiting
it
to...
to
employment,
prerogatives
of
employment.
704
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it
wouldn't
have
to
do...
i
mean,
fairly...
you
know,
to
be
fair,
it
wouldn't
have
had
to
say
that.
it
would
have
said
any...
any
act
that
is
discrimination
under
703.
any
act
that
is
discrimination
under
703.
seven
words
it
could
have
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
curiosity.
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
issue
would
be,
i
assume,
how
much
a
reasonable
person
likes
a
free
lunch.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
are
you?
i'm...
i'm
a
little
concerned
that...
that
you're
trying
to
persuade
us
to
interpret
704
the
same
as
703
at
the
expense
of
watering
down
703.
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
concede
that...
that
refusing
to
invite
somebody
to
lunch,
if
it's
more
than...
more
than
a
single
lunch,
could
be
a
violation
of
703.
how
does
that
come
within
the...
with
respect
to
compensation,
terms,
conditions,
or
privileges
of
employment?
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
not
by
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and...
and
going
to
lunch
is
the
conditions
of
employment.
justice
antonin
scalia
privilege.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
you
say
that
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
would
be
covered
by
the
meritor
standard,
if
in
fact
this
woman
couldn't...
couldn't
really
do
the
job
with
this...
with
this
new
time
assignment?
why
wouldn't
it
qualify
as
being
sufficiently
severe
or
persuasive--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
alter
the
conditions
of
the
victim's
employment
and
create
an
abusive
work
environment?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
she
was
docked
in
her
pay
for
2
weeks.
i
mean,
for
some
people,
this
would
be
a
real
hardship,
no
pay
for
2
weeks.
i
mean,
it's...
it's
final
as
far
as
she's
concerned,
for
those
2
weeks.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
they
went
back
later
and...
and
made
up
for
their
mistake.
but...
but
the...
it
seems
to
me
the
issue
is
whether
a
mistake
was
made
that...
that
was
final
action
that
hurt
her.
i
don't
see
why...
it's
certainly
official
action.
i
mean,
you
can't
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
official
just...
just
because
it
was
decreed
by
a...
you
know,
a
track
boss
or
something.
it...
it
was
an
action
of
the
company
because
the
company
cut...
cut
off
her
pay
for
2
weeks.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
that's
his
point.
i
mean,
that's
his
point,
that...
that
the
one
way
to
avoid
the
problem
is
to
keep
shifting
people
around.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
if
that
hurts
you
or
helps
you.
i
mean,
that...
that
eliminates
what
seems
to
me
is
the
strongest
argument
of
the...
of
your
side,
which
is
that
it
makes
no
sense
to
impose
greater
sanctions
upon
somebody
who...
who
files
a
complaint
than
it
does
upon
somebody
who...
who
violates
somebody's
race,
religion,
or
whatever
by...
by
discriminating.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
telling
me
it
does
make
sense,
that
we've
done
it
in
other
areas.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
i'm
a
supervisor,
and
the
employee
files
a
complaint
against
me
as
a
supervisor.
thereafter,
i
am
not
as
friendly
to
that
employee
as
i
used
to
be.
i
don't
smile
and
say,
good
morning,
how
are
you,
as
i
used
to.
all
right?
[laughter]
and
you
wouldn't
expect
me
to.
this
person
has,
you
know,
hauled
me
onto
the
block.
now,
am...
am
i
discriminating
against
that
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not?
i'm
not
treating
her
the
way
i
did
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
sort
of
like
taking
her
to
lunch.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
say
it...
it
has
to
be
part
of
my...
it
doesn't
have
to
relate
to
her
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
you
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
it's
not
the
same
as
703.
but
somehow
you
say
it...
it
has
to.
does
it
have
to
or
not
have
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
worry
about
that,
as...
as
varied
as
the
human
imagination.
juries
can
have
wonderful
imaginations.
i
mean,
that...
that
is
the
problem.
is
it
meant
to
be
this...
this
uncontrolled,
this
uncabined?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
is
your
criterion
that
is
going
to
stop
every
little
thing
from...
from
being
deemed
a
retaliatory
measure,
such
as
not
saying
good
morning
to
this
employee?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
almost
any
act
of
his
subordinates
will
be
deemed
act
of
the...
of
the
employer
where
retaliation
is
concerned,
i'll
bet
you.
what
else
besides
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
give
you
causation.
but
i'm
talking
about
the
triviality...
the
triviality
of
the
action
in
question.
is
there
no
test
that
eliminates
a
trivial
action
from
the
aggrieved
employee
who...
who
wants
to
litigate?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
reasonable
person
would
what...
would
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
reasonable
person
would
consider
it
to
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
adverse.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
eeoc
standard
any
more
based
in
the
text
of
the
statute
than...
than
the
standard
proposed
by
your
adversary
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose...
suppose
i
disagree
with
you
as
to
the
standard,
that
is,
i
think
704
and
703
both
require
something
related
to
the
employment.
would...
what
would
the
outcome
be?
would...
would
the
case
have
to
go
back
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
under
that
standard?
what
standard
did
the
jury
find--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that
isn't
the
test,
i
mean,
whether
you
can
convince
a
jury.
i
think
you...
you
have
to
acknowledge
that...
that
before
we...
we
say
that
these
trial
instructions
were
adequate
to...
to
give
you
your
victory,
we...
we
have
to
find
that
at
least
a
reasonable
jury
could
conclude
under
section
703
that...
that
both
of
these...
both
of
these
adverse
actions
qualified
as
discrimination
under
703,
if...
if
we're
going
to
use
that
test.
right?
you
acknowledge
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
that...
that
is
at
least
what...
what's
before
us
here,
that
if...
if
we
go
the
703
equals
704
route,
we
would
have
to
conclude,
in
order
to
affirm
here,
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
find.
this
jury
did,
but
we'd
have
to
find
that
that's
reasonable.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
the
other
argument
is
that
if
you
don't
do
it,
there's
no
way
to...
to
get
a
case
dismissed
before
it
goes
to
a
jury.
you're
saying
every
claim
is
going
to
be
a
jury
trial.
i
mean,
that...
you
know,
come
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
triviality
issue
would
be
out
of
the
case.
no
matter
how
trivial,
it
goes
to
a
jury.
that's...
that's
what
you
want
us
to
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
we
have
to
have
some
per
se
rules.
