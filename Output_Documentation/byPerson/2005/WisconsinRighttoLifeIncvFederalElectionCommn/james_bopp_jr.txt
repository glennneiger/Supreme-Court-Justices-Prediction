mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
thank
you,
and
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
involves
the
fundamental
first
amendment
question
of
whether
the
government
can
shield
lawmakers
from
grassroots
lobbying
about
upcoming
votes
in
congress
through
campaign
finance
laws.
this
court
has
distinguished
the
regulation
of
corporate
electioneering
from
efforts
to
influence
law
making,
finding
sufficiently
compelling
governmental
interests
in
regulating
electioneering,
but
not
grassroots
lobbying.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
there...
there
is
a
few
specifics
about
the...
about
our
ad
that...
that
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
of.
first,
it
was
not...
the
call
to
action
at
the
end
of
the
ad
was
not
just
call
them
up
and
tell
them
what
you
think.
the
call
to
action
was
to
call
the
senators
and
ask
them
to
oppose
the
filibuster.
so
it
was
specific.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
and
then
it
refers
to
a
web
site,
[befairdotorg,]
which
contained
prominently
on
the
first
page
the
phone
numbers
and
addresses
and
all
contact
information
for
these
two
senators.
the
decision
was
made
by
the
speaker
here
that
it
would
be
more
likely
that
the
recipient
of
the
ad
would
remember
the
phrase,
[befairdotorg,]
and
seek
the
information
on
that
web
site
than
to
have
a...
you
know,
a...
a
phone
number
that
is
just
simply
more
difficult
to...
to
remember.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
it...
it
doesn't,
the
one
that
you
mentioned,
because
it
was
just
call
them
up
and--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
it--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--no.
in
your
previous
case,
there
were
certainly
genuine
issue
ads.
this
court
recognized
that
it...
that
there
were
genuine
issue
ads
that
were
not
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
an
election.
i
believe
that
these
ads
are
at
the
very
core
of
what
a
genuine
issue
ad
is.
it
involves
a...
a
pending
legislative
issue,
and
the
only
reference
to
the
senator...
and
it
was
both
senators,
not
just
the
one
up
for
election...
was
to
contact
them
about...
about
how...
whether
to
support
or
oppose
that
specific
initiative.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
that...
that
part
of
the
opinion
needs
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
footnote,
which
is
attached
to
those
very
words,
which
said
in
footnote
88
that
the
interests
that
support
regulation
of
electioneering
may
not
apply
to
genuine
grassroots
lobbying
and
distinguished
the
mcconnell
case
from
bellotti
and
mcintyre.
so
we
do
have
to
recognize
that
there's
two
things
going
on
here.
there...
there
is
an
election,
but
also
congress
is
in
session.
the
government
is
engaging
in
its
law
making
function.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
of
course,
the
final
point
is...
is
in
the
record,
that...
that
is,
it
was...
the...
it
was
supposed
to
come
to
a
head
in
november
and
then
it
did
not.
it
was
abandoned.
but
the...
but
the
point
is
you
cannot...
i
don't
think
that
the
government
can
condition--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well...
well,
the...
the
filibuster
issue,
as
it
related
to
that
session
of
congress,
it
was
thought
that
it
was
going
to
come
to
a
head
in...
in
october...
excuse
me...
but
it...
but
as
a...
but
it
did
not.
so
that
is
the
reason
why
it
was...
it
would
not
have
been
run
after
november.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
each
organization
has
to
make
an
assessment
with
respect
to
the
different
issues
that
they
want
to
be
lobbying
on
and
the...
their
pressing
nature.
and--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well...
well,
it
was
in
the...
in
the
next
session
of
congress
and
has
been
an...
an
issue.
but
each...
a
lobby
organization
makes
a
decision
about
the
priorities
that
they
have
and
whether
or
not
their
lobbying
effort
will
most
likely
affect
legislative
action.
so--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
the--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
yes,
and
in
fact
these
radio
and
television
ads
were
continuing
up
until
the
blackout
period
and
it
was
the
blackout
period
that
triggered
the
case.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no.
i'm
asking
you
to
give
meaning
to
the
holding
of
this
court
that
there
were
genuine
issue
ads
that
were
broadcast
during
that
period
of
time.
the
government
conceded
7
percent,
asked
you
to
do
a
broadrick
analysis
upholding
the
statute
on
its
face,
reserving
as
applied
challenges
to
genuine
issue
ads
in
subsequent
cases.
that
is
what
this
case
is
about.
and
the
difference
here
is
that
as
judge
leon...
the
record
of
the
case...
in
judge
leon's
opinion,
he
went
for
a
number
of
pages
explaining
what
genuine
issue
ads
in
his
view
were,
and
what...
and
he
said
that
if
the
ad
discusses
a
current
legislative
issue
and
refers
to
the
member
of
congress
in
calling
on
him
or
her
to
take
a
particular
action
on
that
issue,
that
constitutes
a
genuine
issue
ad.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
these
people
are
law
making.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
i'm
sorry.
i
was
interrupted.
i
wasn't
able
to
get
to
that
question.
and
the...
the
government
cannot
condition
the
exercise
of
one
right
on
exercising
another.
there's
a
first
amendment
right
for
the
pac
of
wisconsin
right
to
life
to
support
or
oppose
a
candidate.
that's
different
than
what
its
lobby
group
does.
its
lobby
group
is
primarily
involved
in
influencing
current
law
making.
and
so
that
is
why,
in
the
first
amendment,
petition
is
separately
listed.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
but,
you
know,
the...
the
effect
on
an
election
is
remote
and
speculative
and
not
proven
by...
in
terms
of
genuine
issue
ads
in
this
record.
but
these
people
are
law
making
now.
so
there's
a
pressing
need
and,
indeed,
right
for
people
today
to
influence
the
government's
law
making
regardless
of
the
incidental,
remote,
speculative,
and
unproven
effect
that
that
genuine
issue
ad
may
have
on
an
election.
there...
there
is
simply...
we
just
cannot
get
away
from
the
fact
that
the
most
important
thing
that
government
does
is
law
making,
and
because
they've
scheduled
an
election
should
not
immunize
the
incumbents
from
being
lobbied
about
that
very
law
making
function
that
they're
engaged
in
today.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
you--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well
that
may
very
well
have
been
a
genuine
issue
ad
in
the
mind
of
this
court.
you
only
cited
one
ad,
which
was
on
page
193,
which
was
the
yellowtail
ad,
as
an
example
of
sham
issue
advertising.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
there,
you
know--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well...
well,
the
yellowtail
ad,
which
you
cited
and
quoted
as
a
example
of
sham
issue
ad,
said
that
the...
mr.
yellowtail
had
taken
a
swing
at
his
wife
and
he
justified
that
because
he
said
he
didn't
hit
her.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
then
it
said
basically
call
him
up
and
yell
at
him.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
how
could
it
be--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--sorry.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
as
i
was
describing,
the
yellowtail
ad
was--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--which
involves
very--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--only
on
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
because
the
broadrick
facial
challenge
analysis
that
you
engaged
in
in
mcconnell
is
not
completed
because
that
includes
future
as
applied
challenges.
the
government
argues
that
there
were--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--7
percent--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--genuine
issue
ads--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
i...
i
will
repeat.
the...
it
involves
a
currently
pending
legislative
issue.
it
does
not
talk--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes,
it
was,
and
you
know,
the
chinese--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--but...
but,
your
honor,
the
chinese
example
was
not
cited
by
this
court.
it
was
in
the
record.
and
it
may
be
a...
a
genuine
issue
ad.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
okay?
and...
and
the
government
argued
there
were
7
percent
genuine
issue
ads
really
trying
to
exercise
the
constitutional
right
to
petition
government,
because
government
is
regulating
us
right
now
in
terms
of
their
votes
and
their
actions.
and,
of
course,
that's
why
in
the
first
amendment,
it
doesn't
just
say
speech
and...
and
association
and
press.
it...
it
says--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--petition
the
government.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
think
you
can
create
objective
criteria,
just
like
this
court
has--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
i...
i
think
that
you
can
adopt
objective
criteria
as
you
have
in
the
noerr
v.
pennington
doctrine
to
separate
the
two.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i...
i
would
say
no.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
then
i
misunderstood
your
question,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
they
are
separate
categories.
this
court--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
and
i'm
not
saying
at
the...
at
the
margins
there...
there
may
not
be
doubtful
cases,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
court
in
noerr
v.
pennington
doctrine
has
recognized
and
adopted
objective
criteria
to
distinguish
between
genuine
efforts
to
influence
the
government,
which
is
not
subject
to
the
sherman
act,
and
sham
issues...
efforts
to
regulate--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--no,
the...
no,
they
haven't.
but
right
before
the
2004
election...
excuse
me...
they
gave
an
exception
to
an
auto
dealership
that
wanted
to
continue
to
run
the
name
of
the
owner
of
the
dealership,
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
a
senator...
a
candidate
for
united
states
senate,
during
the
blackout
period.
and
the
commercial
interests
at
stake
there
were
sufficient
for
the
fec
to
grant
an
as
applied
exception
even
though
there
may
have
been
some
incidental
effect
on
the
election.
so
the
fec
has
recognized
that
there
is
interests
which
are
sufficient
and...
and
also
that
the...
the
possible
impact
on
an
election
is
so
remote
that...
that
the
interests
are...
are
sufficient.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
think
that
you
would
look
at,
one,
whether
the...
the
ad
discusses
a
current
legislative
issue;
two,
whether
or
not
it
made
any
reference
to
the
legislator
beyond
lobbying
him
or
her
about
that
specific
issue.
so
there
should
not
be
any
references
to
the
election
or
the
candidacy
of
the
incumbent
or
any
of
those
type
references.
and
if
you
had
that,
you
would
have
a
bona
fide,
genuine
effort
to
lobby.
they
are
voting.
they're
taxing
us.
they're
regulating
us.
and
as
we
know,
the
record
reflects
that
usually
most
of
the...
of
these
issues
are
decided
in
the
context
of
this
blackout
period
at
the
end
of...
end
of
congress.
so
i
know
it
is
difficult
to
balance
these
interests,
but
there
is
more
interest
among
the
people
than
simply
the
remote
and
speculative
effort
to
influence
an
election.
there
is
an
immediate
need
to
influence
how
government
is
regulating
and
taxing
us.
so
that
is
the
interest
that
is
presented
here.
that
is
the
interest
that
the
court
in
mcconnell
recognized
when
the
court
said
there
are
genuine
issue
ads
and...
and
only
engage
in
what
the
government
urged
was
a
broadrick
facial
challenge
analysis.
the
government
said
in
mcconnell,
well,
any
of
these
genuine
issue
ads
can
be
dealt
with
in
an
as
applied
challenge.
now,
they
have
switched
sides
here,
having
asked
the
court
and
the
court
engaging
in
a
broadrick
facial
challenge
analysis...
are
now
saying
that
even
though
broadrick
would
allow
as
applied,
that
you
are
not
to
entertain
any
as
applied.
i
just
don't
see--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
yes,
that
is
true.
and...
and,
of
course,
as...
as
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
that
was
only
part
of
it.
they...
they
didn't
raise
money
with
the
anticipation
of
doing
their
lobbying
with
it.
in
other
words,
they
raised
all
their
lobbying
money
in
their...
in
their
general
treasury.
the...
the
only
funds
they
raised
in
their
pac
is
to
advocate
the
election
or
defeat
of
candidates
or
give
money
to
candidates,
which...
which
this
court
has
recognized
is
a
proper
way
of
directly
affecting
an
election.
but
making
lobbying
into
a
pac
means
that,
number
one,
you're
going
to
have
to
identify
that
effort
to
influence
a
vote...
about
an
upcoming
vote
in
congress,
you're
going
to
have
to
identify
that
as
a
political
activity.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
of
course,
the
prohibition
we're
attacking
is
against
corporations--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes,
but--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--that's
not
what
advocacy
groups
are
doing.
you
know,
people
who
want...
the
wealthy
people
you're
talking
about
have
gone
into
giving
money
to
527
unincorporated
groups
that...
that
are
using
issue
ads
lawfully
through
that
vehicle.
but,
you
know,
before
this
all
happened,
the
1996
and
the
record
of
mcconnell
where,
all
of
a
sudden,
there
were
more
of
these
issue
ads,
the
record
also
reflects
that
there
had
been
issue
ads,
you
know,
throughout
history.
and...
and,
of
course,
those
were
all
these
efforts
to
influence
the
upcoming
votes
in
congress.
so
that
occurred
before
this
effort
with
sham
issue
ads.
it...
it
would
occur
now
except
that
genuine
issue
advocacy
through
grassroots
lobbying
is
now
swept
in
under
the
reason
that
it
might
have
an
incidental
effect
on
elections.
this
court
just
simply
needs
to
recognize
that
there's
more
to
government
than
elections,
and
even
more
importantly
than
elections
is
the
law
making
function
and
that...
that
people
should
not
be
disabled
from
using
most
effective
means
to
influence
that
law
making
with...
on
the
basis
that
simply
there's
an
election
coming
up.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
this...
what
plaintiffs
are
relying
upon
here
is
the
distinction
that
this
court
has
made
between
lobbying,
on
the
one
hand,
and
political
campaigns
on
the
other.
as
summarized
by
justice
stevens'
concurrence
in
austin,
quote,
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
lobbying
and
debating
public
issues,
on
the
one
hand,
and
political
campaigns
for
election
to
public
office
on
the
other
hand.
and
that
is
because
that
the
interests
that
have
justified
the
regulation
of
corporate
electioneering
do
not
apply
to
corporate--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--i
think
they
do,
and
they
drew
a
line
that
was
upheld
on
its
face
because
the
vast
majority
of
ads--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--i...
i
don't
think
you
owe
deference
to
the
test.
under
strict
scrutiny,
you
owe
the
fidelity
of
the
constitution,
and
the
constitution
includes
the
right
to
petition.
so
it
is
a
difficult
question.
it's
fact
intensive,
as
all
as
applied
questions
are.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no.
i
think
that
you
can
draw
a
rule
that
relies
on
objective
criteria,
just
as
you
have
in
the
noerr
pennington
doctrine,
to
distinguish
between
illegitimate
efforts
to...
for
predatory
anticompetitive
practices
or
monopolies,
to
distinguish
between
those
and...
and...
the
court
has
even
used
the
phrase,
genuine
efforts
to
influence
congress
with
respect
to...
or
any
governmental
agency
with
respect
to
the
adoption
of
laws.
that
has
been
based
on
objective
criteria
as
the
court
has
explained.
you
have
adopted
objective
criteria
to
distinguish
lawsuits
that
fall
within
the
right
to
a
petition
or
those
that
were
brought
illegitimately
for
anticompetitive
reasons.
it's
not
that
this
is...
this
exercise
is
an
easy
exercise,
but
it
is
demanded
by
the
fact
that
the...
the
congress
adopted
a
very
broad
statute.
the
only
content
in
this
electioneering
communication
provision...
the
only
content
requirement
is
that
you
name
the
candidate.
and
the
reality
is
that
those
candidates
often
are
incumbents
and
they
are
engaged
in
law
making
functions
during
these
election
periods.
i
mean,
there
is
a
difference
like
in
britain.
you
know,
parliament
is
dissolved
so
that
there...
there
is
a
bright
line
distinction
between
an
election
and
parliament
actually
exercising
governmental
power.
but
when
these
things
overlap
and
when
the
constitution
demands
the
recognition
of
the
right
to
petition,
then
that
needs
to
be
dealt
with
in
this
as
applied
challenge.
now,
there's
a
vast...
there's
a
huge
number
of...
of
lobby
groups.
they
have
made
a
conscious
decision
that
it
is
more
important
to
them
to
influence
what
government
does
today
than
to
influence
in
a
speculative
and
remote
manner
who
is
going
to
be
exercising
that
power
next
year
through
elections.
wisconsin
right
to
life,
in
the
face
of
these
restrictions,
have
still
decided
that
it's
more
important
to
lobby
than
it
is
to
advocate
the
election
or
defeat
of
candidates
and
give
money
to
candidates.
the...
this
is
just
the
reality
of
our
complex
government.
it's
the
reality
of
the
freedoms
that
individuals
have
to
participate
in
that
government.
it's
not
just
about
elections.
it's
more
importantly
about
law
making
and
citizens
have
a
robust
right
to
participate
in
that
law
making
power,
and
as
a
result,
this
court
should
recognize
an
as
applied
exception
for
grassroots
lobbying.
thank
you.
