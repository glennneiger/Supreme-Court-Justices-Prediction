justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
didn't
hear
the
names
of
the
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
might
have
been
that
90
feet
included
a
public
street
and
you
couldn't
go
down
a
public
street
without...
so...
and
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it...
it
does
seems
strange
to
me
in
a
speech
case
to
say
we're
foreclosing
as
applied
challenges.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
preventing
people
from
thinking
about
an
issue
and
then
calling
their
senator
during
the
blackout
period.
that's
the
compelling
interest
that,
in
effect,
you
are
arguing
for.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are...
are
web
sites
and
chat
rooms
covered
by
the
mccain
feingold?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
certainly
under
your
view,
they
ought
to
be.
if
you
funded
a
web
site
which
was
very
popular
or
a
chat
room,
i
certainly
think
it
should
come
within
your
proscription
so
that
we
can't
talk
about
issues
during
an
election.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why...
why
not?
suppose...
suppose
most
people
look
at
the
web
site
and
they
don't
listen
to
the...
listen
to
the
radio.
i
think
certainly
mccain
feingold
should
be
extended
to
that
under
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
general--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
they...
and
they
could
have...
they
could
have
named
senator
kohl,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
such
an
odd
calculus.
who
is
the
person
more
likely
to
be
influenced
with
an
issue
ad?
the
person
who's
running
or
the
person
who's
not
going
to
run
for
4
years?
obviously,
the
former.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's...
and
that's
the
one
area
where
the
ad
is
prohibited.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
do...
you
do
an
ideological
history,
an
ideological
pedigree
of
various
speakers.
you
think
that's
consistent
with
the
first
amendment?
that...
that
was
the
aclu's
suggestion
which,
it
seems
to
me,
shows
you
how
far
we've
gone
down
this
road.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
the
difference...
the
difference
is
this
is
a
content
based
inquiry.
