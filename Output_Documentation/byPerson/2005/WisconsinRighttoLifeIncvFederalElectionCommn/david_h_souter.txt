justice
david
h.

mr.
bopp,
right...
right
there
i
guess
i...
i
have
a
problem
with...
with
your
argument,
and
i
just
want
to
get
it
out.
i
went
back
and
looked
at
some
of
the
examples
that
were
given
at...
in...
in
the
mcconnell
case
for
parallels
between
what
we...
what
we
thought
was
covered
in
those
cases
and...
and
yours...
your
case.
and
the...
the
one
which
i...
i
guess
was
probably
the
closest
was
the...
was
the
advertisements
there
in...
in
the
mcconnell
case
on
the...
the
lobbying
on
the
chinese
trade
relations.
the
basic
message
in...
in
that
case
was
china
uses
forced
labor.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
about
to
make
it
easier
for...
for
chinese
goods
to
get
in
here
and
for
china
to
have
a
respectable
trade
status.
and...
and
it
said,
call
congressman
myrick,
i
think
it
was,
in
any
case,
a
member
of
congress,
and...
and
say
what
you
think.
in
this
case,
you're...
you're
talking
about
a...
a
filibuster,
and
you
say,
you
know,
they're
filibustering
nominees
and
they're
not
coming
up
to...
to
a
vote.
tell
the
two
senators
in
this
state,
kohl
and
feingold,
that...
that
you
don't
like
this.
the
only
difference
that
i
could
see
basically
between
the
two
kinds
of
ads
was
that
in
the
first
one...
in...
in
the
myrick
ad,
they
actually
gave
the
number
of
the...
of
the
congressional
office
to
call
and
say,
hey,
don't
do
this.
in
this
case,
your
clients
did
not
give
a...
a
number.
they
gave
a
web
site
to
an
organization.
insofar
as
i
know,
it
doesn't
have
a
number.
which
gets
me
to
the
question.
if
the...
the
chinese
trade
relations
ad
was
presumably
validly
subject
to
the
act,
i
don't
see
why
your
client's
ad
is
not,
for
the
same
reason,
subject
to
the
act
and
for
the
further
reason
that
it
doesn't
even
give
a
phone
number
to
call...
to...
to
lobby
people.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
on
stare
decisis
grounds,
unless
we're
going
to
go
back
and
simply
reexamine
mcconnell
to...
to...
from...
from
scratch,
that
your
clients
fall
within
the
general
rule
as...
as
we
held
it
in
mcconnell.
so
why
doesn't
precedent
foreclose
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
didn't
even
give
their
phone
numbers.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
if
we
accept
that
extra
step,
that's...
that
gets
you...
if...
if
we
accept
the
extra
step
that
gets
you
parallel
to
the...
to
the
ad
that
we
considered
in
mcconnell.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
are
right--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
why
didn't
we
have
to
go
the
other
way
in
the
chinese
trade
relation
example?
i
mean,
everything--
justice
david
h.
souter
--unless
i'm
missing
something
in
your
argument,
everything
you
are
saying
in
this
argument
could
have
been
said
with
respect
to
that
ad
and,
as
justice
breyer
said,
to
a
couple
of
others.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
we...
we
cited
some
other
examples
as...
as
examples
that,
on
the
face
of
it
and
on
the
face
of
the
record,
would...
would
lawfully
fall
within
the...
the
general
rule
that
we
said
congress
could
prescribe.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
point--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i...
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off
from
your
yellowtail
argument,
if...
if
you
want
to
make
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
your
ad
is
very
much
like
a
nonyellowtail
ad.
and
the
problem
that
we
would
have
in
accepting
your
argument
is,
number
one,
a
problem
of
precedent
and,
number
two,
the
problem
that
justice
breyer
raised
that,
again,
we
had
dealt
with
in
the
prior
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
let
me
just
finish
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
once
you
get
out
of
the
sphere
of...
of
kind
of
sham
ads
that
just
hit
you
in
your
face,
there
isn't
a
practical
way
to
tell
the
difference.
there
isn't
a
kind
of
magic
formula.
we
rejected
the
magic
word,
or
congress
rejected
the
magic
word's
approach.
and
therefore,
congress
came
up
with
a
rule
that
it
did
within
certain
time
limits,
identified
candidates,
identified
audiences.
you
can't
do
it
within
this
period
of
time
unless
you
do
it
through
a
pac.
what
is
different
in
your
case
from
those
paradigm
examples
in...
in
mcconnell?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
yellowtail--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is...
is
an
ad
of...
an
obviously
sham
ad.
the
problem
that
we're
dealing
with--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may...
may
i
finish?
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me.
may
i...
may
i
finish
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
finish
my
question?
the...
the...
no
one
is
saying
that
your
ad
in
this
case
is
an
obviously
sham
ad
like
yellowtail.
your
ad
in
this
case
is
one
of
those
ads
that
it's
difficult
to
deal
with
fairly.
you
can
say,
well,
you
know,
it's
an
electioneering
ad
and
you
can
say
it's...
it's
a
lobbying
ad.
and...
and
congress
decided
how
to
deal
with
them.
we
said
that's
okay.
why
doesn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
why
doesn't
your
ad
fall
within
the
reasoning
that
we
used
in
approving...
on
the
facial
challenge,
in
approving
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
no...
no
question
about
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your...
your
as
applied--
justice
david
h.
souter
--challenge
has
got
to
have
something
different
about
it,
something
unusual
that
says
this
is
why
my
ad
does
not
fall
within
the
general
rule.
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
the
chinese
trade
issue
currently
pending?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that's
no
difference.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
