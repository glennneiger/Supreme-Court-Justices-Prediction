chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
no.
04-1581,
wisconsin
right
to
life,
incorporated
v.
federal
election
commission.
mr.
bopp.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
point
was
that
it
was
not
an
issue
after
the
election.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
were
you
taking
a
position
on
this
issue
prior
to
the
election
time
frame?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
had
you
taken
out
advertisements
prior
to
that
time
frame?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the...
does
the
fec
draw...
distinguish
between
sham
ads
and
genuine
issue
ads?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bopp.
general
clement,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
mcconnell
against
fec,
you
stood
there
and
told
us
that
this
was
a
facial
challenge
and
that
as
applied
challenges
could
be
brought
in
the
future.
this
is
an
as
applied
challenge
and
now
you're
telling
us
that
it's
already
been
decided.
it's
a
classic
bait
and
switch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
other
case
that
you
can
cite
where
we've
upheld
a
facial
challenge
and
then
later
said
that
an
as
applied
challenge
was
barred
by
our
ruling
on
the
facial
challenge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
like
justice
stevens,
i
think
that's
a
yes
or
no.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
a
very
different
question.
that's
interpreting
the
scope
of
congress's
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
issue
is
whether
it's
limited
to
the
constitutional
violations
or
sweeps
more
broadly.
if
you
conclude
that
it
sweeps
more
broadly,
it's
not
suggesting
that
an
as
applied
challenge
can
be
brought
by
someone
who's
covered
by
the
broader
sweep.
that's
a
very
different
question.
is
there
any
first
amendment
case
where
we've
said
this
is
facially
valid
and
then
said
as
applied
challenges
can't
be
brought?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
like
in
any
of
those
cases
where
you
have
a...
a
broad
prohibition
and
you
say,
yes,
there
may
be
situations
where
it's
unconstitutional,
but
the
statute
is
valid
on
its
face.
and
then
someone
comes
in
and
says,
well,
my
situation
is
one
where
it's
unconstitutional.
we've
never
said,
well,
it's
too
bad
because
it's
valid
on
its
face,
have
we?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
let's
say
you
had
an
organization
that
every
month
of
every
year
it
took
out
an
ad
the
first
week
of
every
month,
and
it
said
the
same
thing
and
it
said,
contact
your
senators.
this
issue
is
important
to
us.
and
they
do
that
every
month.
all
of
a
sudden,
their
ad's
nature
changes
because
an
election
is...
happens
to
be
coming
up
and
it's
illegal
the
month
before
the
election,
even
though
it
was
clearly
something
that
they
did
without
regard
to
the
election.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
we
want
to
place
an
ad
in
october,
the
solution
is
to
place
an
ad
november
through
september,
and
then
we're
okay.
and
the
only
reason
we're
going
to
do
it
november
through
september
is
so
we
can
do
it
in
october?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
pretty
broad
definition
of
a
sham.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
on
an
issue
like
this,
the
filibuster,
it's
the
senators
who
are
doing
it,
and
their
ad
referred
to
not
only
the
senator
who
was
up
for
election,
but
the
one
who
was
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
may
be
because
the
people
who
were
doing
the
filibuster
were
the
senators.
it's
not...
it's
not
a
surprising
thing
to
link
the
senators
to
that
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
fact
that
it
mentions
both...
the
fact
that
it
mentions
both
senators
strongly
suggests
to
me
that
it's
concerned
about
the
issue
because
one
of
the
senators
wasn't
up
for
election.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you're
trying
to
influence
the
senators
who
are
presumably
or
possibly
in
their
home
state
during
a
recess,
that's
perfect
timing
to
influence
the
senators
who
are
the
ones
engaging
in
the
filibuster--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--without
regard
to
whether
they're
running
for
election
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i've
lost
track
of
it.
your...
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
about
bread
for
the
city
and
the
hurricane
and
all
that
is
that
that
would
be
an
illegal
ad?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
both
of
those
examples,
of
course,
are
quantities,
and
once
you...
i
think
it
was
holmes
who
said,
once
you
admit
the
necessity
of
drawing
a
line,
you
know,
you
can
always
find
something
on
one
side
or
the
other.
it's
quite
different
between
$1,000
and
$2,000
or
100
feet
and
75
feet
and
advocacy
with
respect
to
an
election
and
advocacy
with
respect
to
an
issue.
it's
an
entirely
different
quality
of
a
distinction,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
bopp,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bopp.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
we
have
a
per-curiam
opinion
to
announce
in
no.
04-1581,
wisconsin
right
to
life,
incorporated,
versus
the
federal
election
commission.
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act
of
2002
prohibits
corporations
from
using
general
treasury
funds
to
pay
for
electioneering
communications.
these
are
defined
to
include
broadcast
advertisements
within
a
certain
period
of
an
election
that
mention
a
candidate.
in
2004,
wisconsin
right
to
life
wanted
to
run
television
ads
asking
wisconsinites
to
tell
their
senators
to
oppose
the
filibuster
of
judicial
nominees.
the
advertisements
were
covered
by
the
definition
of
“electioneering
communication”,
because
they
included
the
name
of
a
senator
up
for
re-election
and
were
going
to
run
within
60
days
of
the
2004
election.
wisconsin
right
to
life
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court,
arguing
that
applying
the
act
its
advertisements
violated
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
rejected
this
claim,
because
it
considered
the
argument
foreclosed
by
one
of
our
prior
decisions.
the
lower
court
misinterpreted
that
prior
decision.
in
that
case,
we
considered
to
facial
challenge
to
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act.
but
in
deciding
a
first
amendment
facial
challenge,
we
strike
down
a
statute
only
if
it
is
unconstitutional
in
a
substantial
portion
of
its
application;
otherwise,
we
uphold
the
statute
against
the
facial
challenge
and
leave
it
to
future
as-applied
challenges
to
address
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
particular
applications.
the
government
argued
that
the
lower
court,
after
determining
that
the
as-applied
challenges
were
foreclosed,
also
held
that
wisconsin
right
to
life’s
as-applied
challenge
must
fail.
we
do
not
think
it
clear
that
the
district
court
intended
its
opinion
to
rest
on
this
alternative
ground.
we,
therefore,
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
consider
the
merits
of
wisconsin
right
to
life’s
as-applied
challenge
in
the
first
instance.
this
per-curiam
opinion
is
unanimous.
