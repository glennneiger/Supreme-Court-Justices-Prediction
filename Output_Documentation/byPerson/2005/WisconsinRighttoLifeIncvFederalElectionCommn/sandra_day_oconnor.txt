--in
mcconnell,
the
court
said
corporations
and
unions
may
finance
genuine
issue
ads
during
election
blackout
periods
by
simply
avoiding
any
specific
reference
to
federal
candidates
or,
in
doubtful
cases,
by
paying
for
the
ad
from
a
segregated
fund.
now,
that
language
indicates,
to
me
at
least,
that
the
court
was
saying
there
are
no
genuine
issue
ads
meeting
the
definition
as
you
would
have
us
apply
it
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
this
ad
could
have
been
run
by
your
clients
by
a
segregated
fund.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
ran
out
of
money.
is
that
the
deal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
you
can
say,
yes,
you
can
have
an
as
applied
challenge,
but
this
one
doesn't
meet
the
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
they
have
said
in
the
ad,
call
your
elected
representatives,
not
naming
any
names?
