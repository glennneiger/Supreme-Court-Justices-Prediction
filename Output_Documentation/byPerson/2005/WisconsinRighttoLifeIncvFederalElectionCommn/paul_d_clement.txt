mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
mcconnell
against
fec,
this
court
upheld
title
ii's
definition
and
regulation
of
electioneering
communications
by
corporations
and
unions
as
defined
in
the
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
in...
in
fairness,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
mcconnell
case
at
pages
105
and
106
of
our
brief,
we
said
that
as
applied
challenges
would
arguably
be
available.
but
the
principal
argument
we
stressed
in
the
brief
and
in
oral
argument
was
that,
in
a
sense,
overbreadth
analysis
here
and
even
as
applied
challenges,
though
we
didn't
put
it
in
those
terms,
are
a
little
bit
beside
the
point
because
of
the
nature
of
the
regulatory
structure
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
answer
it,
and
i...
and
i
think
actually--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--okay.
yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
lane
and
hibbs.
i
can't
imagine
after
those
two
decisions
which
upheld
in
facial
challenges
the
statutes
at
issue
there
and
said
that
there
was
not
too
much
prophylaxis
for
purposes
of
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--lane
and
hibbs.
tennessee
against
lane
and
nevada
against
hibbs.
i
can't
imagine
after
those
decisions
that
somebody--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
this
court
has--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
the
case
really
hasn't
arisen
because
generally
when
this
court
clearly
identifies
an
area
where
congress
can
regulate
in
prophylactic
terms,
somebody
doesn't
come
back
in
and
try
to
bring
the
exact
same
challenge.
and
if
i
could
give
you
two
examples.
if
somebody
after
burson
against
freeman,
which
you
may
remember
is
the
case
where
this
court
upheld
a
100-foot
buffer
zone
around
a
polling
place...
if
somebody
came
in
after
that
decision
and
said,
well,
that
can't
apply
to
me
in
an
as
applied
challenge
because
i
only
want
to
stand
90
feet
away,
i
think
they
would
have
gotten
laughed
out
of
court
because
this
court
already
said
that
a
100-foot
buffer
zone
was
sufficient.
i
think
in
a
similar
way--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and...
and,
justice
kennedy,
please
understand
me.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
mcconnell
somehow
magically
jurisdictionally
foreclosed
as
applied
challenges.
and
i
suppose
if
somebody
could
come
in
after
burson
and
give
a
good
reason
why
their
situation
is
very
different,
that
there's
a
super
highway
90
feet
away
or
that
all
they
were
talking
about
is
a
bumper
sticker
on
a
car,
well,
then
maybe
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--exactly,
justice
o'connor.
and
again,
it's
not
because
it's
foreclosed.
it's
because
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
mcconnell
forecloses
the
decision.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
be
a
better
as
applied
challenge.
i
still
think
that
with
respect
to
the
ads
in
the
30
days
before
the
primary
and
the
60
days
before
the...
the
general
election,
that
corporation
could
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
mcconnell
and
say,
oh,
i
understand.
our
remedy
is
not
an
as
as
applied
challenge.
our
remedy--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
no.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
no.
the
point
would
be
in
october
either...
do
exactly
what
this
court
said
at
page
206
of
the
mcconnell
opinion,
either
make
the
ad
in
terms
that
doesn't
expressly
refer
to
the
candidate
which,
if
you're
not
interested
in
influencing
the
candidate
election,
shouldn't
be
a
problem,
or
fund
that
one
advertisement
through
a
separate,
segregated
fund.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
understand
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
if
you
focus
in
on
this
particular
ad,
you
will
see
that
whatever
the
true
intent
of
the
advertisers
here,
this
is
the
kind
of
ad
that
clearly
would
have
an
impact
on
the
election.
i
mean,
it
talks
about
the...
the
filibusters
in
colorful
terms,
associates
them
with
gridlock
and
with
a
state
of
emergency,
and
then
associates
it
with
a
candidate.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
scalia,
it's
not.
but
i
think
what
this
court
very
clearly
did
in
mcconnell
is
it
rejected
an
argument
that
said
that
the
only
thing
that
congress
could
regulate
is
that
which
was
unambiguously
targeted
at
candidate
elections.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
kennedy.
what
we're
arguing
for
stems
from
the
observation
that
this
court
made
in
mcconnell,
which
is
that
when
you
get
up
between
60
days
before
an
election
and
you
look
at
the
ads
that
are
run,
most
of
the
ads,
in
fact,
are
designed
to
influence
candidate
elections.
it's
very
difficult
to
figure
out
exactly
which
ones,
and
there
are
very
serious
problems
with
adopting
a
very
vague
intent
standard.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
they're
not,
justice
kennedy.
the
internet
is
not
covered.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
fact
that
there
are
alternative
methods
available
to
communicate
these
ideas
in
these
ads
is
a
virtue,
not
a
defect
with
this
regulatory
structure.
and
i
would
like
to
focus
in
on
these
ads
because
while
it
is
true
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i...
i'm
not
sure
you
really
do
think
that...
that
mccain
feingold
should
be
extended
to
that.
[laughter]
and
i
do
think
that
this
is
an
area
where
this
court,
in
fairness,
has
recognized
that...
that
any
effort
to
regulate
in
this
area
effectively
has
to
avoid
three
pitfalls.
and
it's
a
very
difficult
task
for
congress.
it
has
to
avoid
being
vague.
it
has
to
avoid
being
overbroad.
and
as
your
question
suggests,
it
also
has
to
avoid
being
so
under
inclusive
and
easy
to
evade
that
it
can
simply
be
circumvented
in
a
way
that
congress
can't
achieve
its
purpose.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i...
i
want
to
be
responsive
and
i
think
the
way
to
respond
is
that
this
court's
decision
recognized
that
these
ads
were
going
to
be
difficult
to
classify
and
that
you
needed
some
kind
of
bright
line
rule
and
that
the
consequences
of
having
a
bright
line
rule
in
this
consequence...
in
this
area
weren't
terrible
because
there
were
alternative
ways
for
them
to
communicate
either
through
a
separate,
segregated
fund
which
served
the
issue
of
the
interests
of
the
statute
or
by
avoiding
the
kind
of
references
that
would
raise
serious
questions
about
tying
the
ad
to
a
candidate
election.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at...
if...
if
you
want
to
keep
the
possibility
open
of
some
as
applied
challenge
and
you
focus
on
these
ads,
these
are
ads
that
clearly,
i
think,
would
implicate
the
concerns
of
congress.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
all
issue
ads
that
come
within
the
statutory
prohibition
are
permissibly
regulable.
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure,
you
can
run
issue
ads
as
long
as
you
either
fund
them
through
a
separate,
segregated
fund
or
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--omit
the
reference
to
the
candidate.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and...
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that
this...
i
do
think
that
is
what
the
opinion
says
and
stands
for.
and
i
think
this
court
recognized--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
for
one
thing,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
discussion
about
sham
versus
genuine
issue
ads
was
really
a
factor
of
the
fact
that
necessarily
in
looking
at
the
record
there,
what
the
court
had
to
do
is
look
at
ads
that
were
run
in
previous
election
cycles
where
this
regulatory
structure
wasn't
in
place
and
try
to
classify
those
ads.
and
as
i
understand
it,
sort
of
genuine
versus
sham
was
a
way
of
capturing
whether
or
not
it
was
an
ad
that
seemed
primarily
focused
on
an
issue
or
primarily
focused
on
a
candidate
election.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
not
sure
which
figure
mr.
bopp
is
referring
to
as
the
7
percent
figure.
i
don't...
i
don't
remember
conceding
that
7
percent
of
the
ads
were
okay.
and
i
think
what
we
very
clearly
said...
and
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
our
briefs,
as
i
did,
i
think
you'll
see
this.
what
we
very
clearly
said...
and
the
court
picked
up
on
it
in
that
line
on
page
206
that
justice
o'connor
read
earlier...
is
that
whatever
was
true
about
a
retrospective
analysis
of
ads
that
were
run
in
an
election
cycle
that
wasn't
governed
by
the
statute,
that
in
the
future
corporations
could
avoid
the...
the
strictures
of
the
statute
by
simply
doing
one
of
two
things,
either
avoiding
making
an
express
reference
to
the
candidate,
which
ought
not
to
be
too
difficult
if
you're
really
just
engaged
in
issue
advocacy,
not
trying
to
influence
a
candidate
election,
or
alternatively,
you
can
fund
it
through
the
separate,
segregated
fund.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
they
didn't
even
do
that
in
this
ad,
as
has
already
been
pointed
out.
and
if
they
would
have
said
find
out
what
you
can
do
to
stop
judicial
filibusters,
visit
[befairdotorg,]
and
avoided
a
reference
to
senator
feingold,
they
could
have
run
this
through
their
general
treasury
funds.
but
they
couldn't
resist
the
temptation
to
mention
senator
feingold
in
this
context--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
they
also
could
have
done
that.
and
i
think
that
the
very
fact
that
they
couldn't
resist
the
temptation
to
link
the
filibuster
issue
to
senator
feingold
is
not
that
surprising--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
though,
i
mean,
fair
enough,
but
i
think
you
also
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
a
context
where
this
filibuster
issue
isn't
some
idiosyncratic
interest
of
the
appellant
here.
this
is
an
issue
that
was
identified
as
a
campaign
issue
by
the...
by...
by
the
candidates
opposing
senator
feingold,
by
the
wisconsin
republican
party,
and
by
appellant's
own
pac.
and
to
the
extent
you're
trying
to
figure
out
whether
this
was
really
designed
to
influence
the
pending
legislative
votes
or
the
election,
the
timing
of
this
ad
strongly
suggests
it
was
designed
to
influence
the
election.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
gets
back
to
justice
stevens'
question
as
to
whether
or
not
these
categories
are
mutually
exclusive.
i'm
not
here
to
tell
you
that
appellants
weren't
genuinely
issued
about...
genuinely
interested
about
the
filibuster
issue.
i
think
they
were
also,
as
their
political
action
committee
press
release
shows,
genuinely
interested
in
sending
senator
feingold
packing.
and
they
had
an
opportunity
to
run
this
ad
and
effectively
get
a
twofer
by
naming
senator
feingold.
now,
they
could
have
resisted
that
and
only
gotten
the
influence
on
the...
the
filibuster
issue,
if
they
had
taken
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they...
they
could
have,
senator
kennedy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
obviously--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--obviously,
you're
right,
justice
kennedy,
but
obviously,
there
are
concerns
that
are
implicated
when
somebody
is
running
in
cycle
and
the
ad
has
targeted
the
electorate
in
the
immediate
run
up
to
the
election
that
aren't
present
there
with
senator
kohl
and,
therefore,
the
congress
has...
has
struck
a
different
balance
in
that
case.
but
just
to
focus
on
the
timing
of
these
ads,
they
were
run
on
day
4
of
a
45-day
august
recess
of
the
senate.
now,
that
timing,
if
what
you
were
trying
to
do,
is
to
influence
a
pending
legislative
vote,
is
very,
very
odd
timing.
it
could
hardly
be
worse.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
you're
trying
to
influence
the
upcoming
election,
the
timing
of
that
ad
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
not
sure
i
would--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
sure
i'd
pick
day
4
of
the
august
recess
to
do
that.
maybe
14
days
before
they're
going
back,
something
like
that,
would
be
an
appropriate
time
to
catch
their
attention
in
a...
in
a
period
where
they're
going
to
remember
it
when
they
go
and
vote.
but
i
think
day
4
of
a
45-day
recess
is
probably
not
when
i
would
pick
to
start
running
these
ads.
i
don't
suggest,
though,
the
timing
factor
or
any
other
one
factor
ought
to
be
dispositive.
i
think
what
it
goes
to
show
is
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
try
to
get
into
a
fact
intensive
as
applied
analysis
of
these
various
issues.
and
all
of
that
presumably
would
have
to
be
done
in
the
context
of
tro
hearings
and
preliminary
injunction
hearings
on
the
eve
of
elections.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
no,
i
think
my
answer
to
that
would
be
that
we'd
still
be
here
suggesting
that
that's
controlled.
i
think
my
answer
was
also
that
that
would
be
a
far
better
as
applied
challenge
than
the
one
that
this
court
has
before
it.
and
i
think,
you
know,
in...
in
one
sense
we
make
this
point
in
the
brief.
i
mean,
contrasting
this
case
with
a
case
like
mcfl
i
think
is
quite
instructive.
there,
you're
not
focused
on
the
content
or
intent
of
specific
ads.
you
look
at
the
organization
as
a
whole
and
come
up
with
fairly
bright
lines.
and
once
you've
made
a
determination
about
the
organization
in
an
as
applied
challenge,
you're
done
with
the
issue.
here,
the
kind
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean,
that
may
speak
about
where
the
aclu
is
going.
i
don't
think
it
speaks
about
where
this
court
is
going
because
this
court
hasn't
adopted
that
test.
the
test
that
this
court
adopted
in
mcfl
would...
did
not
get
into
that
kind
of
inquiry.
what
it
did
is
it
focused
on
three
relatively
bright
line
factors
about
whether
you
accept
corporate
money,
whether
you
have
other
sources
of
income
from
the
corporation,
and
whether
or
not
you
were
formed
expressly
for
political
views
but
without
any
sort
of
censorship
or
inquiry
into
what
kind
of
political
views.
and
that
i
think
this
court
has
found
administrable.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
fec
administer
that.
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
you're
not
wrong,
justice
breyer.
and
i
would
say
that
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
answer
both
questions.
as
to
the
527
issue,
as
i
understand
it,
the
commission
has
decided
to
proceed
on
case
by
case
inquiries
and
has
not
tried
to
have
a
broad
regulatory
approach
yet.
now,
on
to
the
issue
of
electioneering
communications,
you're
absolutely
right
that
there
is
a
statutory
authorization
to
create
exceptions.
but
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
commission
is
limited,
and
it's
limited
in
the
sense
that
they
can't
approve
an
exception
that
would
allow
for
ads
that
engage...
that...
that
fairly
read,
engage
in
promoting,
attacking,
supporting,
or
opposing
a
candidate.
and
what
the
fec
has
found
in
practice
is
that
it's
very
difficult
to
create
that
kind
of
regulatory
exception
because,
as
this
court
recognized
in
buckley
and
in
mcconnell,
one
does
not
want
to
naively
underestimate
the
creativity
of
corporate
spenders
or
political
consultants.
and
if
you
create
a
bright
line
and
say,
all
right,
if
you
do
this,
that's
grassroots
lobbying,
that's
not
electioneering
communication,
they're
going
to
be
able
to
drive
a
truck
through
that
kind
of
exception--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--unless
you're
exceedingly
careful.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
as
i
understand
the
record,
the
first
effort
to
broadcast
this
ad
was
on,
i
think,
july
26th,
and
that
was
sort
of
a
few
days
before
the...
the
cutoff
period
would
kick
in.
so
there
was
an
effort
by
a
matter
of
weeks
to
broadcast
this
ad.
but
i
think,
you
know,
whether
one
views
that
as
setting
the
stage
for
this
litigation
or
being
kind
of
an
independent
decision,
i'll...
i'll
leave
to
others.
what
i
think
is
important,
though,
is
that
although
they
were
engaged
on
this
issue
before
then,
up
until
that
point,
they
had
found
it
perfectly
satisfactory
to
engage
on
the
issue
without
engaging
in
broadcast
advertisement.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
don't
have
as
good
an
answer
for
that
as
i
would
like
because
the...
the
web
site
is
now
defunct.
and
so
maybe
mr.
bopp
can
answer
that
in
rebuttal.
as
i
understand
it,
consistent
with
what
justice
breyer
said,
that
there
was
sort
of
additional
arguments
about
the
feingold
record
on...
on
filibusters
and
senator
kohl's
record
on
filibusters,
and
then
there
was...
there
was
information
about
how
to
contact
them.
but
i
think,
again,
as...
as
mr.
bopp
has
said,
if...
if
you
don't
find
the
broadcast
medium
a
particularly
effective
way
to
convey
the
phone
numbers
and
you
have
to
reference
people
to
the
web
site
anyway,
the
very
fact
that
you
could
reference
them
to
the
web
sites
without
naming
the
candidates'
names
and
avoid
the
strictures
entirely
seems
like
the
kind
of
thing
that
this
court
had
in
mind
when
it
said
on
page
206
that
there
were
ways
to
deal
with
this
problem
prospectively
and
that
you
didn't
need
a
as
applied
challenge
like
this
one.
and
again,
i
think
you
can't
overestimate
the
difficulties
here
because--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
hope
that's
not
the
case,
justice
scalia.
let
me
give
you
two
other
first
amendment
examples,
the
first
admittedly
involving
intermediate
scrutiny;
the
second,
a
strict
scrutiny
case.
the
first
thing
i
have
in
mind
is
the
contribution
limits
themselves.
this
court
has
fully
admitted
that
it
doesn't
have
a
scalpel
to
probe
the
difference
between
$2,000,
$1,000,
$4,000
as
a
contribution
limit.
and
it's
perfectly
willing
to
admit
in
its
opinions
that
not
every
high
value
donor
is
going
to
be
involved
in
an
effort
at
corruption.
yet,
this
court
approved
the
approach
of
the
contribution
limits,
which
are
hard
to
understand
as
anything
other
than
prophylactic
limits.
now,
that's
an
example
from
intermediate
scrutiny.
even
in
the
strict
scrutiny
context,
though,
a
case
like
burson,
i
mean,
this
court
understood
and
said
in
the
opinion,
we
can't
tell
whether
75
feet
would
be
precisely
okay
or
whether
90
feet
or
100
feet.
we
don't
have
a
scalpel
to
probe
that
either.
but
we're
going
to
approve
100
feet
because
it's
a
basic
way
of
dealing
with
this
problem,
identifying
the
area
of
potential
concern,
and
people
can
do
their
electioneering
101
feet
away.
they
can
do
it
here
on
the
61st
day.
they
can
do
it
through
the
segregated
fund.
i
think
that
is
an
approach
that
this
court
has
found
acceptable,
even
in
the
first
amendment
area,
in
dealing
with
these
intractable
problems.
and
i
think
buckley--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well
but,
justice
kennedy,
precisely
because
you
can't
engage
in
just
a
formless
content
based
inquiry
and
precisely
because
there
isn't
any
neat
division
between
issue
ads
and
candidate
ads,
that
is
why
you
need
to
have
a
different
regulatory
approach.
i
mean,
this
court
recognized--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely,
justice
stevens.
and
of
course,
an
even
position
one
step
intermediary
from
that
or
one
step
backtracking
from
that
would
be
to
say
that
all
congress
can
do
in
this
area
is
regulate
those
ads
that
are
unambiguously
election
oriented.
and,
of
course,
what's
the
class
of
those
ads?
well,
that
would
be
express
advocacy.
and
the
one
thing
that
i
think
is
clear
from
this
court's
decision
in
mcconnell
is
this
court
made
clear
that
express
advocacy
is
not
a
constitutional
line.
congress
is
not
disempowered
to
go
after
mixed
ads
that
are...
yes,
they
have
a
component
of
issue
ads,
but
you
bet
you
they're
intended
to
influence
the
election.
those
ads
are
what
are
at
issue
here,
and
i
think
in
order
to
be
able
to
regulate
those
in
a
way
that
makes
sense,
the
key
is
to
regulate
in
a
way
that's
not
vague,
that's
not
overbroad,
but
is
not
so
under
inclusive
that
it
can
be
easily
evaded.
and
i
think
buckley
shows
how
hard
that
is.
it's
a
tall
order.
in
buckley,
this
court
had
a
provision
of
feca
that
prohibited
independent
expenditures
related
to
a
candidate
election.
the
only
way
the
court
could
save
that
provision
from
the
vagueness
concern
was
to
limit
it
to
express
advocacy.
but
having
done
that,
the
court
said,
well,
it's
so
limited,
it's
so
easy
to
evade,
we're
going
to
find
that
it
fails
strict
scrutiny.
in
mcconnell,
this
court
said
that
in
bcra,
after
careful
study,
congress
had
actually
found
out
a
way
to
avoid
those
three
pitfalls.
all
of
the
proposed
alternatives
of...
of
appellants
run
headlong
into
one
or
more
of
those
obstacles.
look
at
the
tests
they've
proposed.
they've
proposed
looking
at
16
factors,
4
details.
they
disclaim
any
interest
intent,
but
any
of
those
tests
i
think
would
be
vague
and
unworkable.
in
contrast,
they
pluck
a
definition
from
the
irs
regs
that
is
designed
to
deal
with
501(c)(3)
corporations
in
a
completely
different
context
or
a
modification
of
a
proposal
by
bcra's
sponsors,
and
they...
and
they
put
those
tests
out
there.
and
those
would
be
very,
very
easy
to
evade
in
practice.
in
fact,
i
think
if
you
use
some
of
the
tests
that
they
propose
or
their
amici
proposed
and
you
look
at
the
body
of
ads
that
were
before
this
court
in
mcconnell,
you'd
end
up
finding
that
a
substantial
percentage
of
them
were
grassroots
lobbying.
well,
if
one
thing
has
to
be
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
mcconnell,
it's
the
conclusion
that
a
substantial
amount
of
the
ads
covered
by
this
definition
are
unconstitutionally
regulated
because
this
court
clearly
rejected
a
substantial
overbreadth
claim.
the
one
thing
i
would
say
in...
in
closing
is
to
understand
that
congress,
having
sort
of
voided
these
very
difficult
pitfalls
of
vagueness,
overbreadth,
and
easy
evasion,
came
up
with
this
definition
in
title
ii.
but
as
this
court
recognized
in
mcconnell,
title
ii
of
the
statute
does
not
stand
alone.
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
broader
regulatory
regime
here.
and
without
title
ii,
title
i's
limitations
on
soft
money
contributions
to
parties
will
succeed
only
in
taking
that
soft
money
and
directing
it
to
corporations
that
are
closely
aligned
with
candidates
or
with
the
parties
themselves.
this
statutory
as
applied
challenge
that
you
have
before
it...
you
strikes
at
the
heart
of
the
mcconnell
decision
and
at
the
heart
of
bcra's
title
ii.
this
court
should
reject
the
invitation
to
revisit
the
mcconnell
decision
and
should
give
congress'
effort
in
this
area
a
fair
chance
at
success.
thank
you.
