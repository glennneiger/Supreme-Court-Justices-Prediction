ask
one
question
just
to
find
out?
are
you
contending
that
there
is
a
sharp
distinction?
there's
a
category
of
issue
ads
and
a
category
of
election
ads
that
are
mutually
exclusive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
if
you
can
answer
my
question
yes
or
no.
are...
are
you
arguing
there
are
two
mutually
exclusive
categories,
or
are
there
ads
that
fit
somewhat
in
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
able
to
answer
my
question
yes
or
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
claiming
there
are
separate
categories.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
either...
it's
either
an
issue
ad
or
it's
a
candidate
ad.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
the
real
bottom
line
for
the...
your
opponent
is
that
even
a
pure
election
ad
should
get
the
same
constitutional
protection
as
an
issue
ad,
which
is
something
we've
rejected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
vast
difference,
but
the
question
i
have
is
whether
congress
has
any
voice
in
trying
to
draw
the
line
that
divides
the
two
categories.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
if
we
are
in
a
gray
area
that
there's
some
who
could
say
it's
issue
and
some
could
say
it's
electioneering,
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
congress'
test
that
it
has
drafted?
