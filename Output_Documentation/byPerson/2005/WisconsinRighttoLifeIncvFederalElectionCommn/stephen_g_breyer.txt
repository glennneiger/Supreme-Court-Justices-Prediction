justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
if
it's
the
fact
that
you
go
to
the
web
site
and
that's
what's
supposed
to
make
this
what
it
was
in
mcconnell
which,
by
the
way,
we
said
was
illegal,
what
they...
the
first
thing
they're
going
to
see
when
they
get
to
the
web
site,
which
i
agree
with
you...
four
times
in
3
of
the
12
sentences
of
this
ad...
in
3
of
the
12...
it
says,
[befairdotorg,]
visit
[befairdotorg,]
go
to
[befairdotorg.]
and
the
first
thing
that
they're
going
to
see
when
they
get
to
[befairdotorg]
is
a
big
headline
in
bold...
gold...
bold
letters
which
says,
feingold
and
kohl
continue
to
support
unprecedented
filibusters
of
judicial
nominees.
so,
in
fact,
if
[befairdotorg]
is
brought
into
the
picture,
that
makes
this
ad
look
much
more
like
an
effort
to...
to
defeat
senator
feingold
than
the
ad
that
we
considered
in
our
previous
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
basic
question
i
think
is
this.
all
of
us...
or
almost
all
of
us
who
are
here...
spent
an
entire
summer
reading
through
one
of
the
longest
set
of
opinions
i've
ever
seen
from
the
lower
courts
and
going
through
a
record
that
they
had
compiled
over
months
reflecting
6
years
of
congressional
effort.
and
what
that
record
showed
with
dozens,
hundreds
i
think,
of
examples
was
the
basis
for
congress'
conclusion
that
there's
simply
no
way
to
know
whether
an
ad
like
yours
is
a
genuine
issue
ad
or
isn't.
and
the
only
way
that
we
have
a
hope
of
stopping
rich
people
or
corporations
or
labor
unions
from
simply
trying
to
defeat
candidates
by
writing
sham
ads
is
to
have
the
rule
that
we
have.
now,
you
have
a
very
good
argument,
but
it's
an
argument
that
i
heard
right
in
that
case.
and
we
considered
right
in
that
case
issues
like
yours,
just
ads
like
yours,
ads
that
were
even
less
sham
like
than
yours,
if
you
want
to
call
yours
a
sham...
i
don't
mean
to
be
pejorative.
but
we
considered
all
that,
and
then
we
used
them
as
an
example.
and
of
course,
it
was
close.
5
to
4
this
court
said
ads
that
are
even
more
apparently
neutral
on
their
face
than
yours,
congress
can
impose
this
requirement.
now,
what's
different
about
your
ad
than
the
ads
we
put
right
in
that
opinion
as
examples
of
what
we'd
allow
congress
to
control?
what's
different
now
or
are
you
asking
us
to
go
back
only
a
year
later
and
undo
what
we
did?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
is
the
test?
because
i...
my
vague
recollection
from
a
year
and
a
half
ago
is
that
there
was
in
that
testimony
political
consultants
who
said
if
you
really
want
to
defeat
a
senator,
here's
how
you
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
run
an
ad
that
just
speaks
about
a
group
of
senators.
it's
plain
that
they're
bad,
and
then
put
in
some
words
that
mention
his
name
and
everybody
will
get
the
point.
they
said
that's
even
better
than
saying,
vote
against.
and
then
our
opinion
said
there
is
little
difference
between
an
ad
that
urges
voters
to
vote
against
jane
doe
and
one
that
condemns
jane
doe's
record
on
a
particular
issue
while
exhorting
viewers
to
call
jane
doe
and
tell
her
what
you
think.
that
was
the
opinion.
so,
now,
what's
your
test
to
decide
whether
that's
what's
going
on
or
whether
this
is
a
genuine
issue
ad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
you
can
do
this,
can
a
labor
union
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
a
corporation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
then...
then
we're
back
to...
i
mean,
i've
heard
this.
this
is
very
familiar
music
to
me
and
i
think
you
raise
a
tough
issue.
i
just
thought
we
perhaps
had
decided
it.
but
the...
the
reason
that
this
was
so
tough
was
then
these
very,
very
wealthy
individuals...
and
since
i
once
read
through
the
list,
i
know
who
they
are.
and
they...
they
say,
i'm
going
to
give
$15
million.
you
know,
i'm
going
to
give
$15
million.
so
they
hire
this
genius
political
consultant
that's
there
in
the
record.
and
what
happens
is
ads
that
look
an
awful
like
this,
and
this
consultant
says,
hey,
we
have
$15
million
to
pay
for
it
from
this
one
person.
and
they
run
them
all
over
the
country.
and
senator
after
senator
is
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
becomes
a
question
of
motive
and
how
do
we
know
what
the
motive
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
difference
with
this?
i
mean,
in
my
mind
are
possible
as
applied
challenges.
bread
for
the
city.
never
supported
the
candidate,
worried
about
the
hurricane
in
louisiana.
vote
for
relief
for
new
orleans.
write
your
senator,
senator
x.
organization
two.
never
supported
a
candidate
one
way
or
the
other,
but
has
an
issue
they're
always
interested
in,
and
they
run
ads
cycle
after
cycle
after
cycle
and
they
don't
want
to
pull
them
just
because
october
has
come
along.
all
right?
now,
think
of
those
organizations
where
i
think
maybe,
sure,
maybe
they'd
win
their
as
applied
challenge.
and
here,
you're
not
arguing
it...
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
bring
it.
you're
arguing,
of
course,
he
can
bring
an
as
applied
challenge.
he's
just
going
to
lose
given
our
rationale.
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
i
want
to
know
exactly.
i
didn't
think...
i
thought
congress
considered
this
impossible
question.
i
thought
that
7
percent
figure
was
from
a
study,
in
fact,
dozens
of
studies,
where
these
people
who
were
experts,
quote,
decided
that
about
7
percent
of
the
ads
like
this
one
distinguishing
between
really
interested
in
issues
or
interested
in
issues
but,
in
significant
part,
defeating
the
senator.
in
the
latter,
of
course,
it's
campaign
and
it's
part
of
the
regulation
of
campaign
funds.
but
they
didn't
think
we
could
do
it.
they
thought
first
they
could
do
it,
and
then
they
told
the
fec
to
go
and
produce
a
set
of
regs
that
would,
in
fact,
try
to
screen
out
that
legitimate
7
percent.
am
i
wrong
about
how
the
statute
was
supposed
to
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
haven't
they
done
it?
and
i
had
thought
also
that
they
were
supposed
to
control
527's
by
having
regs
or
individual
cases
that
would
decide
whether
there
was
a
mix
of
personnel
between
the
campaign
and
the
527,
whether
they
talked
to
people
and
planned
their
strategy.
have
there
been
those
regs
written?
