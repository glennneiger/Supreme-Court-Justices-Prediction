justice

bader

mr.
bopp,
to
what
extent
can
we
take
into
account
the
surrounding
circumstances?
one
thing
that
you
advocate
is
to
look
at
this
ad
in
isolation,
but
if
you
add
to
it
that
your
organization
made
it
clear
that
it
opposed
the
candidacy
of
senator
feingold
and
that
it
supported
his
opponents,
that
your
organization
also
connected,
as
justice
breyer
just
brought
out,
senator
feingold
with
this
filibuster,
and
then
if
the
filibuster
was
such
an
important
thing
for
grassroots
lobbying,
why
was
it
that
when
the
election
was
over,
this
ad
was
not
repeated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
return
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
bopp,
then
can
we
return
to
my
question?
do
we
view
the
ad
in
isolation,
and
do
we
discount
the
connection
by
your
organization
of
this
senator
with
the
filibusters
that
you
said
was
a
very
bad
thing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
electorate
will
know
that
this
issue
is
presented
to
them
in
connection
with
this
senator
and
that
your
organization
has
linked
the
two
very
clearly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
clement,
if
you
could
clarify
for
me
some...
a
response
that
mr.
bopp
gave.
did
this
ad
run,
was
it
broadcast
or
televised
before
the
blackout
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
one
other
thing
about
the
setting?
when
you
went
to
the
web
site
to
get
further
information,
what
was
conveyed
about
senator
feingold
when
you
went
to
get
that
further
information?
