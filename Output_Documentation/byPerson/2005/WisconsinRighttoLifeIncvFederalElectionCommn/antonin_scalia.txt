justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
what
you
just
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
once
it
didn't
come
to
a
head
in
november
and
it
was
still
an
issue,
why
didn't
you
continue
to
run
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bopp,
did...
did
the
opinion
refer
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--sham
ads?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
opinion
refer
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
congress
has
the
power
to
prohibit
any
first
amendment
contact...
conduct
that
might
have
an
impact
on
the
election?
i
mean,
is
that
the
criterion
for
whether
it...
it
can
be
prohibited?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
bright
line
rule
that...
that
you
think
the...
the
opinion
established?
i
thought
the
bright
line
rule
was
whether
it's
an
issue
ad
or...
or,
rather,
a
phony
issue
ad.
i
thought
that
was
the...
the
line
that...
that
the
opinion
was
trying
to...
to
draw.
you...
you
say
that
the
opinion
drew
the
line
between
what?
all
issue
ads
are
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
issue
ads
during
the...
the
blackout.
justice
antonin
scalia
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
of
course,
i
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
stand
on
your
head.
but
the--
[laughter]
within...
within
the
framework
of
the
statute,
you
think
the
clear
line
that
is
established
by
the
opinion
is
no
issue
ads
without
this
special
funding
during
the
blackout.
you
think
that's
what
the
opinion
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
it
speak
about
sham
issue
ads?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
you
say
there
were
7
percent
of
these
that...
that
are
probably
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
deny
the
first
thing,
that
it's
easy
to
do
issue
ads
without
naming
the
candidate.
the...
the
point
of
an
issue
ad
is
to
put
pressure
on...
on
the
candidate
that
you
want
to
vote
your
way.
without...
without
telling
people
to
call...
not
the
candidate...
the...
the
incumbent
that
you
want
to
vote
your
way...
without
telling
people
to
call
the
office
of
that
incumbent,
you're
not
doing
very
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
clement,
you...
you've
pointed
out
the
difficulties,
but
i
don't
know
any
other
area
where
we
said,
well,
you
know,
the...
the...
when
you're
dealing
with
important...
important
freedoms,
important
guarantees,
where
we
shrug
our
shoulders
and
say,
well,
the
only
way
to
accomplish
what
the
government
wants
to
do
is
to
ride
right...
right
over
those
guarantees.
i
mean,
we
say,
we...
we
cannot
bust
up
this...
this
drug
conspiracy
unless
we
use
warrantless
searches.
so,
you
know,
whatever
it
takes.
we
don't...
we
don't
operate
that
way.
and
here,
you're...
you're
dealing
with
a
very
fundamental
guarantee--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the...
the
right
which
i
think
applies
to
corporations,
as
well
as
to
anybody
else,
and
for
individuals
to
associate
with
one
another
to
bring
to
bear
influence
on
the
legislative
process.
that's
a
fundamental
guarantee.
and
it
doesn't
satisfy
me
to
say,
well,
there's
no
other
way
to
stop
people
from
criticizing
incumbents
during...
during
the
election
blackout
period.
maybe
you
can't
do
entirely
what
you
want
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
position
basically
would
say
we
should
take
all
of
these
cases
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
not
give
any
presumptive
weight
to
what...
what
congress
has
done.
