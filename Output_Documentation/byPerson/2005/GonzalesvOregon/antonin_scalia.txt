justice

at
most,
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
most,
it
would
allow
him
to
prosecute,
or
to
move
for
the
discertification
of
doctors
who
engage
in
that
practice.
and
if
the
state
chooses
to
do
it
without
doctors,
it
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
elevate
your...
the
microphone.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
too
tall.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
didn't
"stop
it"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
could
the
state
allow
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
state
allowed
it,
the
federal
government
would
have
to
allow
the
drugs
to
be
used
for
that
purpose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
thought
that
at
the
time
this
legislation
was
enacted,
it
would
have
been
as
unthinkable
for
a
state
to
allow
drugs
to
be
used...
to
be
prescribed
by
a
doctor
to
kill
a
patient
as
it
would
be
for
drugs
to
be
subscribed
by
a
doctor
to
make
the
patient
feel
better.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
think
that
assisted
suicide
would
have
been
as
unthinkable
at
the
time
this
was
enacted
as
prescribing
cocaine
just
for
recreational
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
comes
down
to
an
argument
that
"accepted
medical
practice"
means
accepted
medical
practice
state
by
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--rather
than
on
some
uniform
basis.
do
you
have
any
other
area,
regarding
the
enforcement
of
this
act,
where
the
drug
is
allowed,
or
not
allowed,
to
be
used
on
the
basis
of
divergent
views
of
medical
practice
by
divergent
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
such
as?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
palliative
care?
and
you
think
in
some
states
you
can...
you
can
prescribe
these
drugs
without
violating
the
act;
whereas,
in
other
states,
the
same
prescription
would
violate
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
violate
the
federal
law
in
those
other
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
so
you
say
that
in...
with
respect
to
many
aspects
of
this
legislation,
what's
lawful...
and
what's
lawful
depends
upon
the
accepted
medical
practice
within
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
this
have
to
be
reflected
in
the
state
medical
board
determinations,
or
just
in
what
the...
what
the
doctors
in
that
region
tend
to
think
is
a
good
idea?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
cases
that
you
can
think
of
where
the
same
prescription
has
been
held
okay
in
one
state
and
not
okay
in
another
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
atkinson,
you've
spent
most
of
your
time
talking
about
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
do
you
also
make
the
argument
that,
even
if
the
government
wanted
to
do
this
thing,
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
would
it
raise
a
significant
constitutional
question?
i
take
it
that
it's
none
of
the
government's
business
whether
people
gamble
or
not.
i
take
it,
it's
none
of
the...
the
federal
government...
i
take
it,
it's
none
of
the
federal
government's
business
whether
people
are
allowed
to
drink
at
21
or
at
18,
innumerable
other
things,
which
really
are
matters
that
belong
to
the
police
power
of
the
states.
but
the
federal
government
has
chosen
to
regulate
those
things
through
the
use
of
its
commerce
power.
is
the
drinking
age
any
more
a
matter
of...
or
any
less
a
matter
of
state
privilege
than
suicide?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
are
those...
are
those
entries
of
the
federal
government
into
the
regulation
of
drinking
age,
are
they
unconstitutional--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
do
they
raise
serious
constitutional
questions?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
does
this
one?
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
if
ten
states
adopted
assisted
suicide,
it
might
be
a
different...
a
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
--constitutional--
justice
antonin
scalia
--question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
you
would.
i
think--
[laughter]
it
seems
to
me...
it
seems
to
me
that
you...
that
you
cannot
accept
the
premise
that
it
guts
the
act,
if
you
come
in
here
with
the
proposition,
which
you
do,
that
what
the
act
says
is
whatever
is
accepted
medical
practice
within
the
state
is
okay.
that's
your
principal
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
act
does
not
refer
to
any
overall
federal
accepted
medical
practice.
it
refers
to
accepted
medical
practice,
state
by
state.
and,
therefore,
it
in
no
way
guts
the
act
if
a
state
wants
to
let
these
drugs
be
used
for,
you
know,
make
people
happy
purposes.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
accept
the
premise.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
all
different
manners
of
assisting
people
to
stay
alive
or
assisting
people
to
feel
better.
assisting
people
to
die
is
something
of
a
totally
different
category.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
deny
that.
i...
i'm
not
taking
a
position
on
whether,
you
know,
a
state
wants
to
allow
it,
or
not.
i'm
just
taking
a
position
on
whether
it
was
envisioned
by
congress,
in
1971,
that
accepted
medical
practice
would
include
prescribing
drugs
to
help
somebody
end
his
life.
and
i
don't
think
it...
i
don't
think
it
would
have
occurred
to
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
about
gutting?
never
mind
mr.
atkinson's
argument.
what
about
gutting?
