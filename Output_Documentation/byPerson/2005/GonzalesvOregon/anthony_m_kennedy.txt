justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
for
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--for
me,
the
case
turns
on
the
statute.
and
it's
a
hard
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
would
be
to
say
that
the
justice
department
has
found
this
practice
to
be
an
abuse
of
the
drug.
but
then,
my
question...
and
if...
if
you
had,
in
fact,
given
that
answer,
my
question--
[laughter]
--my
question
would
then
be,
isn't
that
an
odd
statutory
scheme,
where
the
attorney
general
can
find
it
to
be
an
abuse
of
the
use
of
the
drug
if
the
state
of
oregon
has
specifically
told
its
doctors,
under
special
procedures
in
defined
circumstances,
that
they
can
administer
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's...
that's
a...
the
slipper
slope
argument
that
i
wanted
to
explore
a
bit.
if
we
do
rule
against
you,
and
for
the
state
of
oregon,
on
the
statute,
you
do
think
that
there
will
be
some
other
serious
consequence
which
will
hinder
the
department
of
justice
in
an
orderly
implementation
of
this
statute,
particularly
under
the
abuse
formulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
part--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--part
of
the
regime
referred
to
under
the
statute...
and
it's
801(a)
implementing
the
convention
on
psychotropic
drugs...
and
there,
the
implementation
incorporates
the
treaty...
but
it
says
that,
"this
shall
not
displace
the
judgment
of
the
medical
community,
as
determined
by
the
secretary.
"
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
cuts
against
you
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
statute
gives
the
attorney
general
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
for
the
dispensing
of
drug...
821...
and
that
seems
to
me
to
describe
precisely
what
the
attorney
general
has
done
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--very
odd
to
have
a
regulation
on
dispensing
that
takes
no
account
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
drug
is
being
used.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
give--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
a
statutory
reference,
and
then
you
tell
me
about
something
else.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
impact
profound
because
they
were
in
what's
now
schedule
1,
that
they
were
just
prohibited?
in
other
words,
were
doctors
allowed
to
prescribe
opium
for
some
purposes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
controlled
substances
act,
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
csa,
it’s
a
federal
law
and
it’s
central
to
federal
enforcement
of
the
nation’s
laws
prohibiting
drug
abuse
and
drug
trafficking.
as
we
have
explained
in
other
decisions,
the
design
of
the
csa
is
to
list
covered
substances
in
one
of
five
schedules.
schedule
i
lists
the
most
dangerous
drugs;
schedule
ii
drugs
are
generally
available
only
pursuant
to
a
written
and
nonrefillable
prescription
by
a
physician.
in
this
case,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
did
not
add
drugs
to
schedule
ii;
the
attorney
general
did
prohibit
doctors
from
issuing
prescriptions
for
schedule
ii
drugs
for
use
in
assisted
suicide.
the
attorney
general
took
this
step
by
an
announcement
on
november
9,
2001,
and
it
is
called
an
interpretive
rule.
the
occasion
for
the
rule
was
an
oregon
law
enacted
by
a
statewide
ballot
measure.
the
law
is
entitled
that
oregon
death
with
dignity
act.
it
legalized
physician-assisted
suicide
under
certain
circumstances.
the
oregon
law,
unique
to
that
one
state,
applies
to
oregon
licensed
physicians
and
terminally
ill
patients
in
oregon.
the
patients
must
have
been
diagnosed
with
an
incurable
and
irreversible
disease
likely
to
cause
death
within
six
months.
before
prescribing
the
dosage,
the
physician
must
take
a
number
of
steps.
these
include
certifying
that
the
request
is
voluntary;
that
there
is
no
psychological
disorder;
giving
information
to
the
patient
about
alternative
care
and
counseling;
obtaining
conformation
from
a
second
physician;
and
maintaining
detailed
records,
which
are
open
for
state
inspection.
the
interpretive
rule
issued
by
attorney
general
relies
on
the
csa’s
requirement
that
prescriptions
be
issued
for
a
legitimate
medical
purpose.
it
concluded
that
assisting
suicide
is
not
a
legitimate
medical
purpose,
so
any
prescription
under
the
oregon
death
with
dignity
act
would
become
unlawful.
a
physician
in
violation
of
the
statute
also
would
risk
deregistration
under
the
act,
preventing
him
or
her
from
issuing
any
prescription
at
all
for
control
substances.
various
physicians,
pharmacists
and
patients
in
oregon
brought
suit
in
federal
court
to
declare
the
interpretive
rule
invalid
as
exceeding
the
attorney
general’s
authority
under
the
csa.
the
united
states
district
court
enjoined
enforcement
of
the
interpretive
rule,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit
affirmed,
and
the
case
is
now
before
us.
although
the
dispute
in
this
case
is,
in
part,
a
product
of
the
nation’s
political
and
moral
debate
on
assisted
suicide,
the
central
question
is
whether
the
interpretive
rule
is
authorized
by
the
csa.
we
conclude
the
rule
is
not
authorized
by
the
csa,
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
rule
is
an
interpretation
by
an
executive
officer
of
the
government,
and
we
must
first
determine
how
much
deference
to
give
the
attorney
general’s
reading
of
the
act.
the
court’s
decision
in
auer
versus
robbins
requires
substantial
deference
to
an
agency’s
interpretations
of
its
own
regulations;
but
we
do
not
think
auer
requires
us
to
give
substantial
deference
here,
because
the
interpretive
rule
relies
on
a
regulation
that
simply
repeats
the
substantive
requirements
of
the
csa.
second,
we
do
not
think
deference
is
warranted
under
our
decision
in
chevron
versus
natural
resources
defense
council.
our
later
decision
in
united
states
versus
mead
held
that
chevron
deference
is
warranted
only
when
it
appears
congress
delegated
authority
to
the
agency
to
make
rules
carrying
the
force
of
law.
here,
the
phrase
“legitimate
medical
purpose”
is
indeed
a
generality
susceptible
to
a
more
precise
definition;
in
our
view,
however,
the
rule
was
not
made
pursuant
to
authority
delegated
to
the
attorney
general,
so
it
does
not
receive
chevron
deference.
in
the
opinion
today,
we
recite
these
and
other
reasons
for
finding
the
attorney
general
lacked
authority
to
issue
the
interpretive
rule.
the
statute
and
our
case
law
amply
support
the
conclusion
that
congress
sought
to
regulate
medical
practice
insofar
as
it
bars
doctors
from
using
their
prescription-writing
powers
as
a
means
of
drug
dealing
and
trafficking
as
traditionally
understood.
the
csa,
however,
manifests
no
intend
to
regulate
medical
practice
generally.
this
is
not
surprising.
our
federal
structure
of
government
gives
the
states
great
latitude
to
legislate
to
protect
the
lives
and
health
of
their
citizens.
indeed,
the
structure
and
operation
of
the
csa
presume
and
rely
upon
a
state-regulated
profession.
it
defines
“medical
practitioners”
as
physicians
license
by
their
state
and
considers
the
recommendation
of
state
medical
boards
in
registration
decisions,
and
it
preempts
state
laws
only
to
the
extent
there
is
a
positive
conflict
with
federal
law.
the
oregon
regime
discussed
above
is
an
example
of
the
very
state
regulation
the
csa
presupposes.
under
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
csa,
the
control
substances
act,
the
attorney
general
is
an
unlikely
recipient
of
the
broad
authority
he
seeks.
just
as
the
conventions
of
interpretation
indicate
congress
is
unlikely
to
alter
a
statute’s
obvious
scope
through
muffled
hints.
the
background
principles
of
our
federal
system
belie
the
notion
that
congress
would
use
such
an
obscure
grant
of
authority
to
regulate
areas
traditionally
governed
by
the
states.
the
government
in
the
end
maintains
that
the
prescription
requirement
delegates
to
a
single
executive
officer
the
power
to
shift
radically
authority
from
the
states
to
the
federal
government
to
define
general
standards
of
medical
practice
in
every
locality.
the
text
and
the
structure
of
the
csa
show
that
congress
did
not
have
this
far-reaching
intent,
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas;
justice
thomas
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
