justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
view,
were
it
not
for
the
statute,
the
federal
statute,
your
view
of
the
attorney
general's
authority
is...
leaving
that
statute
aside,
if
it
weren't
there...
the
attorney
general,
should
we
have
an
attorney
general
who
is
opposed
to
the
death
penalty,
could,
in
fact,
regulate
or
stop
federal...
state
death
penalties,
through
this
same
mechanism,
by
saying
that
no
physician
can
be
registered
insofar
as
he
engages
in
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
we're
getting...
at
least
what
i'm
getting
at
was
this
is,
i
would
probably
have
read
the
statute
to
say
that
the
drug
statute,
which
is
trying
to
stop
drug
addiction
and
heroin
and...
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
death
penalty.
and
i
would
think
that
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
the
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
assisted
suicide.
congress
didn't
think
about
the
death
penalty,
and
it
didn't
think
about
assisted
suicide.
it's
rather
like
the
tobacco
case,
except
a
fortiori.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
were...
you
were
going
to
say,
at
one
point...
why
was
congress
concerned
about
overdoses
of
narcotics
and
so
forth?
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
i
mean,
there
was
a
reason,
wasn't
there,
that
they're
worried
about
people
taking
narcotics?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
what
was
the
main--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
would
have
thought
it
was
narcotics
addiction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
if
it
is
narcotics
addiction--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
would
have
thought
that
was
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
all
right.
again,
because
you
know
i'm
going
to
say,
what
has
this
got
to
do
with
that?
so,
why
not
solely?
[laughter]
not
solely.
you
go
ahead.
what
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
yes,
but
it's
through
addiction.
and
this
seems
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
because,
i
mean,
wouldn't...
suppose
that
some
state
said
that,
"we
think
doctors
can
prescribe,
for
people
who
want
to
take
it,
morphine
for
recreational
use.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
matter
what?
i
mean,
they
have
cases
and
so
forth
that
say,
"of
course
a
state
could
go
too
far.
"
"a
state
might
decided
it's.
"
--just
what
i
said.
and
you're
going
to
say
your
case
turns
or
falls...
you
win
or
lose,
depending
on
whether
i
accept
that
a
state
could
not
stop
a
doctor
from
becoming,
in
effect,
a
conduit
to
a
group
of
drug
dealers
by
saying,
"i
think
recreational
use
is
part
of
my
medical
practice?
"
that
would
be
up
to
the
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
disagreed
with
you
about
that,
then
would
you
lose
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking,
if
i
disagreed
with
you
that
i
thought...
we
take
the
facts
of
moore,
where
he's
a
drug
pusher,
the
doctor,
and,
for
some
unknown
reason,
the
state
says,
"that's
fine,
it
doesn't
violate
state
law.
"
but
the
attorney
general
says,
"do
what
you
want
about
state
law.
"
"i
think
it
violates
the
federal
law.
"
suppose
i
think
the
attorney
general
does
have
the
right
to
do
that
for...
assuming
it...
assuming
it...
then
what
do
you
say
about
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
spend
a
minute--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
sorry,
on
that,
i
didn't
think
that
the
reg
was
defining
the
word
"dispense".
i
thought
the
statute
defines
the
word
"dispense".
and
it's...
persons
registered
by
the
ag
to
dispense
controlled
substances
are
exempt.
and
then
you
look
at
who
is
such
a
person.
a
person
who
does
that
is
a
practitioner.
and
who
is
a
practitioner?
a
registered
practitioner
is
one
who
prescribes,
a
physician
registered
by
the
united
states
to
distribute
or
dispense
a
controlled
substance
in
the
course
of
professional
practice.
and
i
thought
this
reg
is
defining
"in
the
course
of
professional
practice.
"
am
i
wrong
about
that?
i
thought
it
was
a
reg
that
says,
"in
the
course
of
professional
practice,
the
prescription,
to
be
effective,
must
be
a
legitimate
medical
purpose
by
an
individual
practitioner.
"
now,
i
might
be
wrong.
how
does
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
matter
of
policy,
i
would...
since...
if
you...
if
you've
said
basically
what
you
want
to
say
in
your
argument,
i
would
appreciate
your
devoting
a
minute
to
an
assumption
which
you
don't
want
to
agree
with.
but
suppose
i
were
to
assume
that
a
state
is
not
free,
through
the
device
of
defining
what's
good
medical
practice,
to
gut
the
act...
that
is,
to
really
make
marijuana
or
something
else,
like
morphine,
legal...
because
they
disagree
with
congress's
basic
judgment
that
it
should
be
illegal.
that
could
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
suppose
i
think
that
the
ag
does
have
the
power
to
stop
congress
from
gutting
the
act.
all
right?
now,
on
that,
do
i
have...
if
i
believe
that,
on
that
assumption,
do
i
have
to
decide
this
case
against
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose,
on
the
commerce
clause
question,
i...
on
assumption,
i
don't
agree
with
you,
either...
then
do
i
have
to
decide?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
far
be
it
from
me
to
suggest
an
argument
that
you
don't
want
to
make,
but,
i
mean,
i've
found
it
different,
in
life
and
law,
when
you
pass
a
rule
in
a
state
that
guts
an
act,
from
when
you
pass
the
rule
in
a
state
that
doesn't
seem
to
have
much
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
act.
