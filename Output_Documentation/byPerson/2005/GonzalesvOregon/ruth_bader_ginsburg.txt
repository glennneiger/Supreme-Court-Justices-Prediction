--may

ask
you
about
the
position
this
court
took
in
glucksberg?
that
is,
everyone
on
the
court
in
that
case
seemed
to
assume
that
physician
assisted
suicide
was
a
matter
for
the
state,
and
the
government,
at
that
time,
said,
"state
legislatures
undoubtedly
have
the
authority
to
create
the
kind
of
exception
to
assisted
suicide
fashioned
by
the
court
of
appeals.
"
"there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
state
legislatures
will
address
the
urgent
issues
involved
in
this
case
in
a
fair
and
impartial
way.
"
and
then
the
government
added
that,
"there
is
no
indication
that
the
political
processes
are
malfunctioning
in
this
area.
"
that
was
a
position
presented
to
this
court
in
the
glucksberg
case
by
the
government.
now,
you
are
rejecting
that
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
told
that
the...
those
methods
are
less
gentle
to
the
patient,
the
methods
that
the
state
of
oregon
has
authorized
its
physicians
to
prescribe.
we
are
told,
at
least
in
some
of
the
briefs,
that,
from
the
patient's
point
of
view,
it's
much
less
upsetting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--congress
spoke--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--congress
spoke
about
section...
schedule
1
drugs,
and
that's
what's
lacking
here.
congress
says
schedule
1
drugs,
those
are
no,
never;
schedule
2
okay
on
a
doctor's
prescription.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
raise
it
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
agree...
you...
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
he
mentioned
a
drug
that
was
a
schedule
1
drug,
morphine.
or
maybe--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--perhaps
it
isn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
schedule
2
drug.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
are
you
saying
that
if
the
doctor
is
using
it,
saying,
"in
my
medical
judgment,
this
makes
people
happy;
and,
therefore,
i'm
going
to
prescribe
it.
"
that
a
state
could
permit
that?
wouldn't
the
moore
case
rule
that
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
the
idea
of
moore
was,
if
you're
using
this,
the
doctor
is
prescribing
the
drug
as
a
pusher.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you,
in...
mr.
atkinson,
in
response
to
the
question
you
were
just
asked,
you
said
there
were
procedural
problems,
no
notice
in
comment.
so,
that's
a
"how"
it's
done.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
"who"?
is
this
something...
how
does
it
work
under
the
controlled
substance
act?
what
authority
does
the
department
of
hhs
have?
what
is
the
division
of
authority
between
those
two
under
the
act?
the
attorney
general,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
and
including
the
fda,
on
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
made--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
made
a
point
earlier
that
the
attorney
general
has
never
done
this
before,
has
never
said,
"you
can't
prescribe
particular
drugs
for.
"
--has...
that
has
not
been
done.
you've
been
giving
examples
of
where
the
fda
ruled
that
you
can't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--use
a
drug.
and
that
control
is
nationwide,
no
matter
what
the
state
medical
board
thinks,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who...
the
consultation,
you
said,
was
not
with
hhs,
and
it
wasn't
with
oregon?
who
did
the
attorney
general
consult?
