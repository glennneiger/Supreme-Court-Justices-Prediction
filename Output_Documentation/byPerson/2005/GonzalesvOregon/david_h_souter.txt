justice
david
h.
souter
does
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--does
the
statute...
does
the
federal
statute
specifically
authorize
doctors
to
do
this?
or
does
it
simply
say
that
convicts
may
be
executed
by
lethal
injection?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
method
may
simply
be
lethal
injection.
and,
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
it
might
still
be
the
case
that,
on
the
theory
the
government
is
advancing
this
morning,
it
would
be
unlawful
for
a
doctor
to
engage
in
that,
because
that
was,
in
fact,
not
within
the
limits
of
the
practice
of
medicine,
the
doctor
was
using
a
controlled
substance
for
something
outside
the
practice
of
medicine,
and
hence,
it
would
be
illegal.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
congress
did
not
refer
specifically
to...
or
did
not
include
a
specific
authorization
of
doctors,
so
that
we'd
have
to
do
a
little
construction
to
get
to
your
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
say--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that,
in
practical
terms,
that
is
exactly
what
it
does,
because
the
only
way
they
can
administer
their
law
sensibly
is
by
using
these
kinds
of
drugs,
scheduled
drugs.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
did
he
use--
justice
david
h.
souter
--did
he
use
a
controlled
substance?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
was
a
clear
act
of
congress.
i
mean,
congress
had
made
that
decision,
and
it
was
unmistakable.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
that
you
have,
with
your
reference
back
to
the
harrison
act
and
the
90
years
of
regulation,
is
that
the
90
years
of
regulation
was
regulation
for
the
purpose
of
stopping
drug
pushing
and
drug
abuse,
in
the
conventional
sense.
and
to
say
that
a
statute...
or
a
statutory
history
taken
into
consideration
in
determining
the
scope
of
this
statute,
with
that
kind
of
a
history,
can
support
a
view
that
suddenly
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
is
given,
in
effect,
the
sole
authority
to
determine
whether
any
state
may
or
may
not
authorize
assisted
suicide,
and
may
do
so
in
a
way
that
any
other
attorney
general
can
flip
back
and
forth...
as
has
happened
in
this
case,
if
attorney
general
reno
was
wrong...
seems
to
me
a
kind
of
argument
from
history
that
simply
cuts
against
you,
because
it
leads
to
a
sort
of
a
bizarre
result.
i
mean,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
and
i...
as
i
said,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
91
years
of
history
say
that
the
end
that
congress
had
in
mind
was
to
stop
drug
pushing
and
stop
conventional
drug
abuse.
it
didn't
have
any
more...
there's
no
indication
that
i
know
of
that
congress
had
assisted
suicide
in
mind,
any
more
than
it
had
the
administration
of
the
death
penalty
in
mind.
justice
david
h.
souter
suicide
is
a
result
of
the
kind
of
dementia
that
comes
from
drug
abuse.
that
is
not
suicide
under
the
circumstances
that
we're
talking
about
within
the
limits
of
the
oregon
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
even
in
your
example,
the
concern
of
congress
is
with
the
use
of
the
drug
to
hurt
people
who
do
not
understand
that
they're
going
to
be
hurt,
and
don't
want
to
be
hurt,
and
perhaps,
in
your
example,
the
use
of
the
drug
to
facilitate
the
violation
of
the
law,
that
seems
to
me
worlds
away
from
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
are
you
saying,
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
that,
in
fact,
congress,
itself,
could
not
explicitly
pass
a
statute
that
says,
"no
state,
through
its
doctors
or
otherwise,
may
authorize
the
use
of
morphine--
"
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
right.
so,
you're
not
making
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--constitutional--
justice
david
h.
souter
--argument.
you're
sticking
to
your
statutory
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that,
in
effect,
all
you
need
to
win
on
the
statutory
argument
is
for
us
to
accept
the
premise
that
congress
may
very
well
have
intended
to
interfere
with
the
practice
of
medicine
and
to
authorize
the
attorney
general
to
do
it,
insofar
as
the
practice
of
medicine
would
have
gutted
the
statute...
e.g.,
doctors
who
prescribe
recreational
drugs,
doctors
who,
in
effect,
cater
to
pushers...
but
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
go
any
further
than
that
in
authorizing
interference
with
the
practice
of
medicine.
i
take
it
you
agree
that
if
we
accepted
that
premise,
that
would
be
sufficient
for
you
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
