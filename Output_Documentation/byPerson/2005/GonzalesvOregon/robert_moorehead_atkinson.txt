mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
since
gibbons
versus
ogden,
at
the
very
latest,
this
court
has
recognized
that,
in
the
system
of
dual
sovereignty
created
by
american
federalism--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
will.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
i'll
work
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
yes,
your
honor.
what
the
court
said
in
gibbons
versus
ogden
was
that
health
laws
of
every
description
were
for
the
states
to
regulate.
in
glucksberg,
this
court--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--that's
certainly
true,
your
honor.
and
yet
i
think
if
you
look
both
at
your
opinion
in
glucksberg
and
in
the
opinion...
excuse
me...
and
in
the
text
of
the
controlled
substances
act,
you
will
find
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
this
specific
subject,
physician
assisted
dying,
is
one
that
is
for
the
states
to
regulate.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
i
agree.
and
let
me
talk,
then,
about
the...
why
we
believe
the
text
of
the
statute
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
to
leave
the
decision
about
what
is,
and
is
not,
a
legitimate
medical
practice
to
the
states,
as
it
has
always
been.
and
that's
the
key
question
in
this
case,
because
the
u.s.
attorney
general--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
limits
clear
in
the
controlled
substances
act.
but
taking
the
hypothetical
you've
offered,
specifically,
we
think
that
the
answer
would
have
to
be
that
congress
intended
to
leave
the
definition
of
what
is
a
legitimate
medical
practice
to
the
states.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
certainly,
the
state
could
stop
it,
yes.
the
question--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--but
that--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--yes.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
well--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--there
are
a
number
of
limits
in
the
text
of
the
act
itself.
there
are
limits
in
other
federal
statutes
not
contained
in
the
csa.
there
is
also
the
political
limits
on
irresponsible
lawmaking
at
both
the
state
and
the
federal
level
that
have
served
us
well
for
almost
200
years.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
your
honor,
many
drugs--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--we
don't
suggest
that
congress
had
physician
assisted
dying
specifically
in
mind
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
the
controlled
substances
act.
what
we
do
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
was
the
200-year
history
of
state
regulation
of
medicine,
of
the
practice
of
medicine,
and
what
were,
and
were
not,
legitimate
medical
purposes.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
i'm
sorry--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--i
think
it
is
a
schedule
2
drug,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
yes.
we
certainly
don't
suggest
that
a
state
could
authorize
the
use
of
a
schedule
1
drug
for
any
purpose
at
all.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
there
aren't...
there
is
no
history
of
the
u.s.
attorney
general
prosecuting
any
doctor
at
any
time
in
the...
in
the...
since
before
moore--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--that's
correct.
and
we
have
no...
we
have--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--yes.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
that
is--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--that
is
not
prohibited
under
the
controlled
substances
act
if
the
doctor
was
acting
consistent
with
the
specific
terms
of
the
act
and
the
specific
terms
of
the
state
statutes.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
as
the
term
u.s.
attorney
general
is
authorized
to
make,
and
required
to
make.
it
is
not
otherwise
generally
used.
what
the
controlled
substance--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--not
if
it
is
permitted
by...
and
regulated
by
state
law.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
i
would
certainly
lose
ground,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
well,
first
of
all,
we
don't
think,
justice
breyer,
that
what
the
u.s.
attorney
general
is
attempting
to
do
here
is
reasonable
within
the
scope
of
whatever
authority
he
has.
moreover,
he
has
not
followed
the
processes
and
procedures
that
are
specified
in
the
controlled
substances
act.
but
our
first
position
in
this
case
is,
he
simply
lacks
the
authority
to
do
that.
the
controlled
substances
act
reflects,
first,
in
section
903,
the
antipreemption
provision,
which
is
found
in
the
state's
brief,
at
page
36,
that
congress
intended
not
to
intrude
on
state
laws
that
would
otherwise
be
within
the
authority
of
the
state.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
i
don't
believe
it
does,
mr.--
chief
justice.
in
the
first
instance,
we
think
the
u.s.
attorney
general's
claim
of
uniformity
is
overstated.
we
think
it's
clear
from
the
text
of
the
statute
that
congress
intended
to
leave
the
definition
of
what
is,
or
is
not,
a
legitimate
medical
practice
in
the
hands--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--of
the
states.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
well,
i
don't
think
the
federal
government
is
supposed
to
enforce
that
prohibition
if
the
prohibition...
if
we're
dealing
with
a
schedule
2,
3,
or
4
or
5
substance.
congress
has
clearly
spoken
to
schedule
1
substances.
once
we
move
into
the
other
substances,
traditionally
and
has...
as
has...
as
been
the...
as
is
the
case
today
in
every
state,
physicians,
under
the
regulation
of
state
medical
boards,
prescribe
those
medications
for
purposes
other
than
those
for
which
they're
normally
prescribed.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
yes.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
well,
there
is
no...
well,
the
congress
can
prescribe...
can
enforce
it
in
any
state
in
which
it
is
not
authorized
by
state
law.
if
the
u.s.
attorney
general
wants
to
regulate
it
in
a
state
where
it
is
authorized
by
state
law,
he
must
go
to
congress
and
get
a
clear
statement
of
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
not
at
all,
justice
souter.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
no,
not--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--at
all.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
we're
sticking
to
the
statutory
argument.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
there
are
any
number
of
areas
in
which--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--states
diverge.
such
as...
palliative
care,
i
think,
is
the
most
obvious
example.
these
days,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
divergence
among
the
states
as
to
how--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--in
some
states,
a
prescription
would
violate
state
law;
and
in
other
cases,
in
other
states,
that
same
prescription
would
not.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
it
would
if
the...
if
the
prescription
violated
the
state
law,
the
u.s.
attorney
general
could
take
action
against
the
physician.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
that's
exactly
correct,
justice--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--your
honor,
what
we
believe
is
that
what
congress
did
in
enacting
the
controlled
substances
act
was
leave
those
decisions
to
the
states
to
enforce
according
to
their
traditional
methods.
now,
in
some
cases,
that
may
be
by
statute;
in
some
cases,
the
states
may
discipline
doctors
for...
through
a
state
medical
board.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
your
honor,
we're
not
aware
of
any
cases
in
which
the
u.s.
attorney
general
has
ever
attempted
to
deregister
or
to
prosecute
a
doctor
who
was
acting
in
accordance
with
state
law.
we
have
a
history
that
we're...
to...
at
least
since
the
controlled
substances
act,
in
1970,
where
the
u.s.
attorney
general
has
never
attempted
to
suggest,
as
he
does
here,
that
something
that
is
permissible
under
state
law
is,
in
any
sense,
a
violation--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--of
the
controlled
substances
act.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
yes.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
justice
stevens,
we
think
that
the
best
reading
of
the
five
factors
is
that
they
continue
to
respect
state
laws.
certainly,
that's
what
the
legislative
history,
for
those
of
you
who
would
be
willing
to
look
at
it,
of
the
1984
amendments
reflects.
congress
was
not
concerned
about
how
states
were
defining
legitimate
medical
practices.
congress
was
concerned
about
the
failure
to
enforce
existing
state
law.
and
that's
clearly
reflected
in
the
legislative
history,
some
of
which
is
set
out
in
the
state's
brief,
on
page
36,
in
note
16.
but
if
you
look
at
those
five
factors,
what
they
are
addressed
to
is
individual
applicants...
that
is,
individual
doctors...
not
to
broad
medical
purposes.
and
what
you're
seeing
here
in
the
attorney
general's
claim
of
authority,
for
the
first
time,
is
rules
that
are
not
addressed
to
controlled
substances,
per
se,
but
to
medical
practices,
and
that
is
something
that
the
congress
simply
never
contemplated
giving
you.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
well,
we
think
there's...
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
chief...
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
is
that,
in
harris
versus
christensen,
this
court
said
that
a
federal
agent
cannot
promulgate
a
new
regulation
in
the
guise
of
interpreting
an
old
one.
now,
in
1971,
when
that
regulation
to
which
you
refer
was
enacted,
it
was
absolutely
clear
that
the
u.s.
attorney
general
could
not
have
deregistered
an
oregon
doctor
who
was
acting
in
accordance
with
state
law,
because,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
united
states
versus
moore,
the
registration
was
a
matter...
was
as
a
matter
of
right
if
the...
if
the
physician
was
in
good
standing
with
state
medical
authorities.
so,
what
he's
attempting
to
do
today,
in
the
guise
of
interpreting
that
rule,
is
to
make
it
mean
something
entirely
different
than
what
it
meant
when
he
enacted
it.
and
i
think
christensen
versus
harris
county
says
that
he
simply
cannot
do
that.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
that's
all
right.
i'm...
i...
i'm
happy
with
the
first
one,
at
this
point.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
we
do,
your
honor.
one
of
the
questions
presented
in
raich
was
whether
congress
"could"
do
what
it
had
done.
the
question
here
is...
first
of
all,
is
whether
congress
"did"
what
it
had
done.
and
our
point
is
not
necessarily
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
that
it
would
raise
a
significant
constitutional
question,
which
implicates
the
clearstatement
rule
and
the
constitutional
avoidance
rule.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
no,
they
don't,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
the
difference
here
is
simply
that
there...
the
amounts,
as
was
suggested
earlier,
are
so
minute
that
there
cannot
be
any
significant
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
there
is
not
even
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
there
is
a
market
for
the
drugs
that
are
used
under
the
death
with
dignity
act,
much
less
if
there
is
an
illicit
trade.
there's
no
question
here
of...
as
the
court
described
it
in
raich,
where
you
had
a
$10
billion
market
of--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--once
again--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--your
honor,
in--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--in
oregon's
experience,
we
have
a
small
number
of
people,
most
of
whom
consume
the
drug.
the
amounts
that
are
left
over,
even
if
this
law
spread
nationwide,
would
not
be
significant.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
i
can't
disagree
with
that,
justice
kennedy.
the
question
is,
does
he
have
authority
to
tell
a
doctor
in
a
particular
state,
not
by
reference
to
a
particular
drug
that
he
may
not
dispense
this
drug,
but
that
he
may
not
dispense
a
drug
for
a
specific
medical
purpose?
and,
as
i've
suggested,
this
is
the
first
time
we've
ever
seen
that
happen.
and
we
think
that's
because
it's
inconsistent
with
the
congressional
design,
which
was
to
leave
the
subject
of
what
are,
and
are
not,
legitimate
medical
purposes
to
the
states
and
to...
and
to
have
the
u.s.
attorney
general
promulgate
rules
that
deal
with
things
like
the...
like
prescriptions,
scheduling
of
those
drugs
so
that
they
are
on
schedule
2
or
schedule
3
or
perhaps--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--schedule
1.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
well,
we
think
it's
somewhat
odder,
frankly,
justice
kennedy,
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
a
single
unelected
federal
official
to
decide,
in
his
sole
and
apparently
unreviewable
discretion,
that
this
medical
practice,
of
which
he
disapproves,
may
not
be--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--followed.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
well,
no,
i...
we
agree
that
he
gets
to
authorize
regulations
on
dispensation...
to
require,
for
example,
that
there
be
prescriptions
before
it
be
dispensed,
that
physicians
shall
follow
certain
rules
and
regulations
before
they
dispense,
and
those
are
the
kinds
of
things
on
which
we
agree
he
has
the
authority
to
engage
in
rulemaking
and
to...
and
to
promulgate
uniform--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--no,
i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
but
the
question...
that
is
a
very
different
question
from
the
question
of,
who
gets
to
define,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
what
is
a
"legitimate
medical
practice"?
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
it
could.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
no.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
for
that,
justice
breyer.
the
first
is
the
commerce
clause
question,
which
we
believe
to
be--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--i'm
starting
to
be
backed
into
a
corner.
[laughter]
i
think...
i
think
the
third
answer
then
becomes
the
procedural
answer,
justice
breyer,
and
that
is
that
what
the
u.s.
attorney
general
is
doing
here
violates
the
rule
this
court
stated
in
christensen
versus
harris
county,
and
he
is
attempting
to
do,
by
an
administrative
rule,
what
he
can
only
do
by
notice
in
comment
rulemaking.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
well,
i
certainly
would
not
disagree
with
that
in--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
i
wasn't
anxious
to
accept
it,
justice
scalia,
but
i--
[laughter]
--i
was...
i
thought
i
was
being
told
to.
let
me--
--but
let
me...
let
me
offer,
if
i
can...
we--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--that's--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--justice
ginsburg,
i
can't
answer
that
question
in
specific
respect
to
this
case,
because
there
is
no
authority
in
the
controlled
substances
act
for
anyone
to
do
what
has
been
done
here...
that
is,
to
focus
on
the
specific
medical
practice
and
say,
"no
controlled
substance"--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--"#
can
be
used
for"--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
yes.
there
is...
there
are...
for
example,
in
scheduling
of
drugs...
and
the
u.s.
attorney
general
suggests,
for
example,
that
he
could
simply
schedule
these
drugs
in
a
way
to...
as
a
way
of
avoiding
the
oregon
act...
or
voiding
the
oregon
act,
as
it
were.
and,
to
do
that,
he
has
to
get
his
medical
and
scientific
advice
from
the
secretary
of
health
and
services,
and
must
accept
that
advice
and
be
bound
by
it.
and
certainly,
that
wasn't
done
in
this
case.
so,
i
hope
that
answers
your
question.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
it
was
solely
done
within
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
that's
exactly
right,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
and
there
are
circumstances
in
which
it
has,
and
those
in
which
it
has
not.
and
to
try
to
respond
to
justice
scalia's
point,
again
i
would
invoke
the
200
years
of
responsible
regulation
of
the
practice
of
medicine,
which
is
the
backdrop
against
which
congress
legislated
in
this
case.
congress
does
not
lightly
assume,
nor
should
it,
that
states
are
going
to...
are
going
to
simply
legalize
drugs
to
make
people
happy.
it
hasn't
happened.
congress
doesn't
assume
it's
going
to
happen.
states
act
responsibly.
congress
assumes--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--no,
that's
certainly
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
congress
knew,
as
we
all
know,
that
the
practice
of
medicine
evolves,
that
things
change,
that
today's...
acupuncture,
the
use
of
botox,
things
that
were
unheard
of
30
years
ago,
are
all
accepted
medical
practices
today,
and
they
are
all
regulated
by
the
states,
not
by
the
u.s.
attorney
general.
and
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
intended
to
enact
a
uniform
medical
practices--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--justice
scalia,
i
have
to
disagree.
there's
a
great
deal
of
medical
practice
now,
and
attention,
focused
on
end
of
life
issues.
this
court
has
seen
them.
for
example,
in
cruzan,
the
court
said
it
is
a
matter
for
the
states
to
decide
those
things.
the
court
has
seen
cases
that
involve
do
not
resuscitate
orders.
the
court
is
familiar
with
living
wills.
there
are
any
number
of--
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
--i
don't
think
that
it
would
have
occurred
to
them
either,
justice
scalia,
but
i
do
think
what
occurred
to
them
was
that
that
was
a
matter
that,
like
any
other
matter
dealing
with
the
regulation
of
medical
practice,
the
states
could
be
trusted
to
act
responsibly.
that's
what
oregon
has
done
here.
that's
what
this
court
invited
the
states
to
do
in
glucksberg.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
that's
absolutely
true.
mr.
robert
moorehead
atkinson
that's
absolutely
true,
justice
souter.
but...
this
case
is
obviously
about
statutory
construction,
but
it's
about
statutory
construction
in
a
very
special
area,
and
that
is
the
area
of
federalism,
of
the
relationship
between
the
sovereign
states
and
the
federal
government.
we
think
it's
clear,
from
examining
the
statute,
that
congress
intended
to
retain
and
respect
the
historic
powers
of
the
states
to
define
legitimate
medical
practices.
