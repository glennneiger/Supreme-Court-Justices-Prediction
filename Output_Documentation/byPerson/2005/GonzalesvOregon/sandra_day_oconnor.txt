justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
would
that
be
true
also
for
any
doctor
who
provided
the
substances
to
furnish
an
execution
of
a
convicted
death
penalty
convict?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
otherwise,
it
would
be
the
same
reasoning--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
would
it
be
open--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
the
attorney
general
to
pass
a
regulation
like
this
one,
and
all
of
a
sudden
apply
it...
some
new
attorney
general,
who
had
a
very
different
view
of
the
death
penalty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
not
if
it
just
refers
back
to
the
states,
would
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
practice
of
medicine
by
physicians
is
an
area
traditionally
regulated
by
the
states,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
is
nothing
express
in
the
statute
suggesting
that
it's
designed
to
put
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
government
or
the
attorney
general
the
regulation
of
the
practice
of
medicine,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
there
were
two
attempts,
were
there
not,
to
get
legislation
passed
to
do
this
expressly
in
congress,
and
they
failed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
a
prior
attorney
general
had
a
different
interpretation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--are
these...
are
these
drugs
classified
as
illegal,
for
all
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
it's
a--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it's
a
different
thing
to
regulate
by
saying,
"no
one
can
prescribe
this
substance.
"
"it's
so
lethal,
we
won't
let
anyone
prescribe
it
at
all.
"
and
it's
quite
different
to
say,
"this...
if
a...
if
a
physician
follows
the
oregon
law,
it's
a...
it's
not
a
legitimate
practice
of
medicine.
"
that's
a
very
different
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
speak
up
just
a
little,
please?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
you
could
raise
the
podium.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
that...
the
crank
will
raise
it,
if
you...
no,
the
other
way
around.
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
could
not
deem
it
to
be
drug
abuse
under
the
act
if
a
state
allowed
that
for
recreational
use
or
to
cure
depression
or...
how
about
steroids
for
bodybuilders
+/?
and
decided
that's
perfectly
okay.
now,
can
the
attorney
general
find
that
that's
drug
abuse?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
understand
your
answer.
could
the
attorney
general
deem
the
authorization...
purported
authorization
by
a
physician
to
use
morphine
to
help
with
depression,
or
steroids
for
bodybuilding...
can
that
attorney
general
say,
under
the
act,
that's
drug
abuse?
