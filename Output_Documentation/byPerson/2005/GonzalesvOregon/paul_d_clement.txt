mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
before
oregon
became
the
first
state
to
authorize
assisted
suicide,
the
prescription
of
federally
controlled
substances
to
facilitate
suicide
generally
violated
state
law
and
also
violated
federal
law.
respondents
contend
that
oregon's
decision
to
remove
the
statelaw
consequences
from
that
conduct
also
operated
to
remove
the
federallaw
consequences.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
violated
the
controlled
substances
act.
and
the
d.a.
had
taken
the
position,
before
oregon
acted,
for
example,
that
the
fact
that
a
doctor
prescribed
controlled
substances
for
purposes
of
a
suicide
was
a
basis
for
revoking
his
license.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
o'connor,
the
death
penalty
situation,
lethal
injection,
is
different,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
of
course,
the
d.a.
has
long
taken
a
position
of
nonenforcement
in
that
context,
which
would
be
protected
by
this
court's
decision
in
heckler
against
cheney.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
it
would,
justice
o'connor,
at
least
not
since
1994,
because
in
1994
congress
passed
a
statute
that
i
think
is
best
read
as
ratifying
the
practice
of
lethal
injection.
this
is
18
u.s.c.
3596.
and
that
statute
authorizes
the
federal
government
to
use
the
method
of
execution
in
the
state
of
the
sentencing
court.
and
at
the
time
that
was
passed,
in
1994,
the
overwhelming
majority...
something
like
25
of
the
38
states...
had
already
used
lethal
injection.
so,
i
would
read
that
as--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--a
ratification--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
think
the
reason
is,
at
a
minimum,
18
u.s.c.
3596,
because
i
think
that
would
now
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
that
type
of
regulatory
impression--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
but
this
is
a
provision
that
dictates
how
the
federal
government
shall
do
its
executions.
and
i
think,
at
that
time,
in
1994,
it
effectively
ratified
the
practice
of
using
lethal
injection.
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
the
statute
itself
says
that
the
federal
government
shall
use
the
method
in
the
state
in
which
the
sentencing
court
sits,
the
federal
sentencing
court.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
again,
justice
souter,
i
think
the
best
reading
is,
that
is
now
foreclosed...
that
interpretation
would
be
foreclosed
by
congress's
action
in
1994.
there
are
also
some
technical
differences--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
we
would
have
to
do
a
little
construction,
in
fairness,
but
i
do
think...
i
mean,
and
there
also
are
some
differences,
because,
for
example,
as
i
understand
the
practice
in
most
states,
doctors
actually
aren't
exactly
involved
in
the
specific
process
of
administering
the
lethal
injection.
there's
also
a
technical
difference,
which
is,
with
respect
to
lethal
injection,
it's
not
the
federally
controlled
substance
which
is
the
lethal
agent.
it's
just
that
there's
a
federally
controlled
substance
that's
used
to
administer...
to
relieve
pain
in
conjunction
with
a
different
injection
that's
not...
that
does
not
involve
a
federally
controlled
substance.
and
that's
actually
the
lethal
agent.
here,
of
course,
it's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
breyer,
i
haven't
thoroughly
considered
the
issue,
precisely
because
i
do
think
the
'94
statute
stands
as
an
obstacle.
it
may
be
that
some
of
the
differences
in
the
way
that
the
death
penalty
is
administered,
the
fact
that
doctors
aren't
directly
involved--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--would
allow
for--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
right.
as
i
say,
i
think
some
of
the
technical
ways
in
which
the
penalty
is
administered
could
make
a
difference.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
several
points,
justice
breyer.
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
i
would
say
that
congress
did
focus
on
suicide,
if
not
physician
assisted
suicide,
and
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction
that
i'd
like
to
come
back
to.
but
i
actually
think
the
comparison
to
the
tobacco
case
is
quite
instructive,
because
there
what
you
had
is
a
statute
in
which
something
seemed
like
it
might
come
within
the
plain
terms
of
the
fdca,
and
yet
if
you
took
that
literally,
it
would
run
smack
into
another
statutory
scheme.
and
here,
there
is
no
other
statutory
scheme.
to
the
contrary,
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
controlled
substances
act,
i
would
say...
and
i'll
address
it
in
a
minute...
is
that
this
falls
within
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general.
and
if
you
look
to
any
alternative
congressional
indication
of
intent
on
this
topic,
the
only
thing
you
would
find
is
the
assisted
suicide
funding
restriction
act
of
1997,
which
continues
a
federal
policy
against
assisted
suicide.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
so,
in
that
sense,
i
think
it's
very
different
than
the
brown
and
williamson
case.
now,
taking,
though--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--as
to
what
congress--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
so.
i...
we
stand
by
the
brief
in
glucksberg.
now,
obviously
in
the
glucksberg
case,
the
federal
law
that
everybody
was
focused
on...
and,
in
fairness,
the
united
states
was
focused
on...
was
the
federal
constitution.
and
so,
that's
one
important
difference.
another
important
difference...
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
point...
is
that
the
federal
regulation
here,
the
interpretation
of
the
attorney
general,
does
not
purport
to
foreclose
the
issue
of
assisted
suicide--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--which
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
souter,
we
don't
have
a
factual
record
on
that
question.
i
think
it's
not
clear
that
that's
the
case,
because,
i
mean,
proponents
of
physician
assisted
suicide
have
identified
alternative
methods.
perhaps
the
most
notorious
proponent
of
physician
assisted
suicide,
dr.
kevorkian,
operated
without
a
federal
controlled
substance
license
for
the
last
six
years
before
his
conviction--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--at
the
time--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--he
did
not.
he
did
not,
which
is
why
he
could
do
that.
so,
it
just
goes
to
prove
that
physician
assisted
suicide
and
the
use
of
federally
controlled
substances
for
physician
assisted
suicide
are
not
coextensive.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
we
operate
without
a
factual
record
on
that
point.
in
doing
some
outside
reading,
it
seems
that
some
of
the
other
methods
are
actually
disapproved,
not
because
they're
less...
more
painful,
but
because
it's
more
obvious
that
it's
a
suicide,
in
certain
cases,
and
the
administration
of
scheduled
drugs
sort
of
blurs
that
line.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
i
guess
my
point
would
be,
even
if
we
take
it
as
true
that
controlled
substances
are
the
most
efficient
way
to
do
this,
i
take
it
as
a
given
that
if
oregon
doctors
decided
that
a
schedule
1
substance
was
the
most
effective
way
to
administer
a
lethal
overdose--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--after
this
court's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--decision
in
raich--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
agree
there
is
that
difference
between
schedule
1
and
schedule
2
substances.
now,
i
think
that
brings
us
to
the
attorney
general's
regulation,
which
is
a
longstanding
regulation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
he
could.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
clear
that
that
isn't
the
authority
that's
invoked
here.
and
the
attorney
general
in
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--olc
opinion
are
patently--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--clear
on
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
stevens,
the
reason
i
would
say
that
it
wouldn't
is,
i
think
you
have
to
read
this
regulation
against
a
backdrop
that
for
90
years
the
federal
government
has
been
involved
in
the
regulation
of
controlled
substances.
now,
there
have
been
a
lot
of
statements
and
a
lot
of
court
opinions
during
that
90
years--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the...
i'm
not
sure
if
you're
referring
to
the
statute
or
the
regulation.
i
would
say
it
this
way,
which
is
to
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
fair,
justice
stevens.
i
don't
take
issue
with
that.
and
i
think
you're
right
to
say
that
the
statutory
grant
of
authority
to
the
attorney
general
is
quite
broad.
he's
supposed
to
make
judgments
in
the
public
interest
about
public
health
and
safety.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is,
i
would
read
all
of
that
against
the
backdrop
that
for
90
years
the
federal
government
has
been
involved
in
the
regulation
of
controlled
substance.
and
we
all
know
that
that
is
going
to
have
an
incidental
effect
on
state
regulation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--of
medicine.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
an
odd
regime.
i
think
if,
for
example,
oregon
made
a
radically
different
judgment
and
said
that
in
oregon
it
was
going
to
be
permissible
to
have
treatment
or
detoxification
programs
that
involve
the
administration
of
radically
larger
quantities
of
controlled
substances
than
had
been
recognized
in
any
other
state,
i
think,
under
the
authority
of
cases
like
moore,
the
attorney
general
can
make
a
judgment...
now,
that's
not
a
legitimate
medical
purpose,
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--an
abuse.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
there
could
be,
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
want
to
overstate
it,
in
the
sense
that...
one
of
the
reasons
you
don't
see
that
much
of
a
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law
in
the
regulation
of
controlled
substances
is
because,
in
the
main,
the
states
have
adopted
uniform
controlled
substances
acts
that
mirror
the
federal
act,
and,
in
most
of
the
instances
there,
works
in
the
way
of
cooperative
federalism
in
dealing
with
this
problem.
this
court
tends
to
see
the
cases...
raich,
in
this
case...
where
there's
a
conflict
between
the
state
regime
and
the
federal
regime.
and
i
guess
my
point
is
the...
in
a
such
a
comprehensive
federal
regime,
if
this
court
makes
clear
that
state
law
can
overtake
the
federal
regime,
i
think
it
at
least
creates
the
potential
for
there
to
be
a
lot
of
holes
in
the
regime
and
the
possibility,
if
states
take
the...
take
you
up
on
that
invitation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
really
undermine
the
regime.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
it
is
perfectly
true
that
there
are
places
in
the
statute
where
medical
or
scientific
decisions
are
expressly
given
to
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
and
not
the
attorney
general,
but
it
is
equally
true
that
there
are
places
in
the
controlled
substances
act
where
medical
determinations
or
public
health
determinations
are
given
expressly
to
the
attorney
general
and
not
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
and
one
of
the
places,
of
course,
that's
true
is
sections
823
and
824
of
title
1...
title
21...
which,
of
course,
are
the
provisions
about
the
registration
and
revocation
of
registrants.
and
congress--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
absolutely
is,
justice
o'connor,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
o'connor,
there's
nothing
that
says
we
want
to
take
over
the
regulation
of
medicine,
but
it's
crystal
clear--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
yes,
but
i
think
this
court
is
always
hesitant
to
draw
inferences
from--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--failed
legislative
efforts.
and
if--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
attorney
general
had
not
adopted
this
interpretation,
it
may
be
that
this
congress
would
have
passed
those
initiatives--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
the
prior
administer
of
the
dea
before
that
had
our
position.
so,
this
is
an
area
where
i
think,
you
know,
there
are
different
approaches
to
this.
what
i
wanted
to
make
clear,
though,
is,
you're
absolutely
right
that
the
regulation
of
medicine
is...
this
court
has
observed...
is
traditionally
left
to
the
states.
but
that
has
to
be
reconciled
with
the
fact
that
for
90
years
the
federal
government
has
had
a
prominent
role
in
the
regulation
of
controlled
substances.
and
it's
been
clear--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--since
the
very--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--not
for
all--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--purposes,
but
they
are
highly
classified,
highly
controlled
substances.
they
are
the...
the
substances
that
are
at
issue
here
are
the
most
highly
controlled
lawful
substances.
and
i
think
if
you
go
back
to
the
history
of
the
harrison
act,
it's
been
clear
since
the
very
first
prosecutions
under
the
harrison
narcotics
act
of
1914
that
the
federal
government's
ability
to
regulate
medicine
was
going
to
have
an
incidental
effect
on
the
state's
ability
to
regulate
medicine.
i
mean,
states
had
much
more
of
a
laissez
attitude
towards...
laissez
faire
attitude
towards
the
opium
trade,
but
that
was
really
displaced
by
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--harrison
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
o'connor,
i
can't
tell
you
there
isn't
a
difference
between
the
treatment
of
schedule
1
substances--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
are
just
verboten
for
all
purposes
and
schedule
2
substances,
but
the
regulation
of
federal
controlled
substances
in
the
harrison
act
has
always
focused
on
drugs
that
have
some
lawful
medical
uses
but
are--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--also
susceptible
to
abuse.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
i
would...
i
mean,
i...
i
guess
i
would
do
two
answers
to
that,
mr.--
chief
justice.
one,
i
would
point
to
the
fact
that,
at
the
genesis
of
the
harrison
act,
it
really
was
displacing
state
medical
judgments
about
the
opium
trade.
i
would
point
to
two
other
examples,
one
under
this
statute
and
one
other
the...
under
the
fdca.
the
idea
under
the
fdca...
the
example
that
comes
to
mind
is
the
fda's
treatment
of
laetrile,
that
this
court
addressed
in
the
rutherford
decision.
in
that
case,
17
states
had
made
a
judgment
that
laetrile
was...
could
be
available,
for
prescription
use,
to
treat
cancer.
and
the
fda,
by
refusing
to
approve
laetrile--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
then
i
think
i
would...
i
mean,
i...
i'm
not
sure
i
can
point
to
a
decision
by
the
attorney
general,
but
i
think
it's...
in
the
structure
of
this
act...
obviously
the
schedule
1
treatment
of
marijuana
that
this
court
had
before
it
in
the
raich
case,
involved
a
situation
where
the
act
clearly
displaced
the
medical
judgments
of
california
and
nine
other
states--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--who
recognized--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
souter,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
regulation
of
drug
abuse
and
ask,
to
what
end
was
congress
regulating
these
substances?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
souter,
what
i
would
say
is,
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
these
substances
is,
they
were
concerned
about
drug
abuse,
not
for
its
own
sake,
but
for
the
debilitating
effect
it
has
on
people's
lives,
for
its
tendency
to
destroy
lives.
and
i
will
grant
you
that
congress,
in
1970,
did
not
have
before
it
in
its
contemplation
a
state
that
would
make
physician
assisted
suicide
lawful.
but
that's
because
it
would
have
been
unthinkable
at
that
time.
and
what
congress
did
have
clearly
in
its
contemplation
is
the
fact
that
a
clear
manifestation
of
a
drug's
potential
for
abuse
was
the
fact
that
it
could
lead
to
suicide
and
overdoses.
and
that's
page
35
of
the
house
report,
for
those
that
look
at
legislative
history.
and
i
actually
think
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
congress
didn't
specify,
one
way
or
another.
and
what
i
would...
i
would
point
you
to
the
house
report,
because
i
think
it
actually
is
indicative,
because
when
congress
is
framing
the
issue,
they
first
look
at
the
extent
of
the
problem.
and
one
of
the
ways
they
identify
the
problem
as
serious
is,
they
point
to
overdoses
that
are
taking
place
among
teenagers.
and
then,
in
the
next
section
of
the
report,
they
look
at
the
question
of
the
consequences
of
drug
abuse.
and
what
do
they
point
to
as--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
mean,
i...
first
of
all,
i
would
say,
as
it
compared
to
raich,
i
would
almost
think
this
is
an
a
fortiori
case,
as
it
affects
commerce,
because,
unlike
raich,
which,
of
course,
were
untraditional
noncommercial
transactions,
the
transactions
at
issue
here
are
standard
commercial
transactions
that
are--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well
within--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
they
do.
and
i
sure
hope
they
do,
because
this
is
a
situation
where
congress
and
the
federal
government
pervasively
regulates
the
drug
transactions
at
issue
here
in
a
way
that
even
respondents
don't
object
to.
the
details
of
the
form
that
you
fill
out
for
the
prescription,
the
fact
that
it
has
to
be
in
writing,
the
regulations
specify
whether
it
has
to
be
in
pen
or
pencil...
i
mean,
there's
such
a
pervasive
involvement
of
the
federal
government
in
the
regulation
of
these
controlled
substances
that
i
don't
think
there's
any
additional
commerce
clause
extension
by
regulating
the
purpose
for
which
the
prescription
is
being
made.
that's
what
the
dea
did
in
the
context
of
marinol,
when
it
was
first
moved
from
schedule
1
to
schedule
2,
that...
we
discuss
that
in
detail
on
page
30
of
our
brief.
and
i
think
that
kind
of
regulation,
although
it's
not
a
common
feature
of
the
dea
in
its
administration
of
the
controlled
substances
act,
is
an
important
one,
is
a
legitimate
one.
and
i
guess
what
i
would
say,
with
respect
to
congress's
intent,
is,
it
seems
to
me
odd
to
think
that
a
congress
that
was
concerned
about
overdoses,
concerned
about
suicides,
would
be
indifferent
or
agnostic
on
the
question
of
using
federally
controlled
substances
for
the
express
purpose
of
inducing
a
lethal
overdose.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
they
were
concerned
with
it
part
and
parcel
of...
because,
i
mean,
i
think
of
the
things
that
congress
does
when
it
regulates
is,
it
regulates
to
protect
life,
to
protect
health
and
safety--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
sure--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--there
are.
sure
they
are.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
they're
worried
about
the
impact--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
it
is,
but,
again,
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
not
solely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
not
solely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
not
solely.
and,
again,
i
mean,
i
think,
you
know,
addiction
qua
addiction
was
not
the
concern
so
much
as
addiction
because
of
its
tendency
to
debilitate
lives--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
destroy
lives--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
no,
i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
instances
where
the
abuse
that
is
being...
that
congress
is
concerned
with
is
not
solely
the
addictive
abuse.
i
mean,
to
take
one
example,
congress
has
recently,
as
part
of
the
controlled
substances
regime,
regulated
ghb,
one
of
these
so
called
"date
rape
drugs".
and
the
concern
for
abuse
there
is
not
its
addictive
quality,
but
the
fact
that
it
can
be
used
in
a
way
that's
not
medical,
that
can
be
very
pernicious,
and
the
like.
and
so,
i
think
that's
just
another
example
of
this
concept
of
abuse
being
much
broader
than
a
narrow
focus
on
diversion
or
a
narrow
focus
on
addiction.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
souter,
i
would
simply
say
that
the
controlled
substances
act,
if
you
look
at
it,
is
a
very
paternalistic
piece
of
legislation.
it's
not
designed
to
let
people
make
their
own
judgments
about
the
health
risk.
and
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
think
respondents
have
embraced
the
logical
consequences
of
their
position.
and
what
it
results
in
is
turning
the
controlled
substances
act,
the
federal
controlled
substances
act,
into
an
odd
patchwork.
it
also
is
profoundly
ahistorical,
because,
at
the
time
of
the
harrison
act
of
1914...
which
the
controlled
substances
act
was
intended
to
strengthen,
not
weaken,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
moore...
at
that
time,
the
states
had
a
variety
of
different
approaches
to
opium
and
heroin
and
other...
and
cocaine
and
other
substances...
opium
and
cocaine
now
of
which
land
on
schedule
2.
some
of
them
tightly
regulated
them,
some
of
them
allowed
them
in
over
the
counter
tonics
in
large
quantities.
and
the
point
of
the
harrison
act
was
to
clean
that
up
and
impose
a
uniform
federal
regime.
and
they
knew
it
would
have
an
impact
on
state
regulation
of
medicine.
and
even
the
court,
in
the
linder
days,
recognize
that
that
was
not,
per
se,
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it's
an
odd
statutory...
i
mean,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the...
with
the
principle
that
the
federal
authority
only
extends
to
prevent
that
which
would
gut
the
statute,
and
no
further.
that
seems
like
an
odd
principle.
and
i
think
that,
here,
it
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
interpretation
of
this
statute
to
say
that
a
congress
that
was
profoundly
concerned
with
overdoses,
with
suicide,
with
drug
abuse,
precisely
because
of
its
debilitating
effect
on
people's
lives,
would
not
have
been
agnostic
at
the
prospect
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--controlled
substances.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
was,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
were
all
over
the
map,
but
there
was
clearly
a
recognition
that
doctors
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
problem,
that
there
were
needs
in
states
to
more
closely
regulate
both
the
doctors
and
the
pharmacies.
that
was,
kind
of,
the
two
problems
that
gave
rise
to
this.
and
there's
no
question
that
the
impact
of
the
federal
program
was
profound
on
the
state's
practice
of
medicine.
nonetheless,
that
program
was
upheld,
and
that
has
been
the
tradition
in
this
area.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
were.
and
opium's
now
on
schedule
2.
the
harrison
act
did
not
have
the
schedules
we're
familiar
with
from
the
controlled
substance.
but
most
of
what
was
at
issue...
i
mean,
opium,
in
its
various
forms,
morphine,
all
of
that
of
that
is
now
on
schedule
2,
and
that's
really
what
prompted
the
harrison
act
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
it's
the
same
reason
as
my
answer
earlier,
which
is,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
this
regime,
and
read
it
in
light
of
the
90
years
of
federal
involvement
in
the
regulation
of
controlled
substances
and
the
lack
of
a
traditional
federal
role
in
regulating
medicine
qua
medicine.
and
i
think
this
is
on
the...
on
the
side
of
the
line
of
regulating
controlled
substances.
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause
issue,
i
would...
thought
that
one
thing
that
came
clear
out
of
the
raich
decision
is
that
the
relevant
factor
to
consider
is
not
the
class
of
activities
that
a
state
decides
to
decriminalize,
but,
rather,
the
class
of
activities
that
congress
decides
to
regulate.
and
with
respect
to
schedule
2
substances,
i
would
think
this
case
is
a
fortiori.
we're
not
talking
about
substances
that
are
homegrown
and
are
never
part
of
a
commercial
transaction.
and
even
those
who
were
in
the
dissent
in
raich,
i
think,
would
think
that
this
was
an
appropriate
commerce
clause
application.
this
case
is
to
raich
as
the
regulation
of
commercial
farming
would
be
to
wickard
against
filburn.
it
is
a
much
different
situation.
congress's
commerce
clause
power
is
more
robust
here.
i
wanted
to
remark
and
focus
for
a
minute
on
what
an
odd
statute
oregon
has
passed.
the
practitioner
respondents
point
out
it
is
a
prescribing
law
only.
and
oregon
itself
points
out
that
what's
allowed
here
is
the
prescription,
but
not
the
administration,
of
these
substances.
even
what
oregon
does,
does
not
purport
to
be
medicine,
as
one
traditionally
understands
it.
i
can
think
of
no
other
medical
substance
where
a
doctor
can
prescribe
it,
but
not
administer
it.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
that
aspect
of
the
statute,
what
becomes
clear
is
that
oregon
is
not
regulating
medicine,
it's
purporting
to
basically
take
a
federal
regulatory
regime
that
allows
doctors
the
ability
to
get
at
schedule
2
substances.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
