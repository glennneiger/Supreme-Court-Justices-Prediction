justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
what
federal
law
does
it
violate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clement--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--general
clement,
before
you
go
there,
i
want
to
question
you
about
your
distinction
between
dr.
kevorkian
and
a
doctor
who
uses
controlled
substances.
why
could
not
the
attorney
general
treat
dr.
kevorkian's
conduct
as
conduct
that
may
threaten
the
public
health
and
safety,
and
seek
his...
cancellation
of
his
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he
can
rely--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
things
like
prior
convictions,
other
things
unrelated
to
a
specific
transaction.
and
if
he
thinks
that
assisted
suicide
is
contrary
conduct
that
threatens
the
public
interest,
health
and
safety,
i
don't
know
why
that
wouldn't
apply
to
dr.
kevorkian,
as
well
as
somebody
using
controlled
substances.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
attorney
general's
directive,
if
i
remember
it,
does
not
identify
any
particular
controlled
substance.
it
just
identifies
a
particular
kind
of
conduct
by
the
doctor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
neither
one.
neither
one
is
identifying
which
schedule
2
or
schedule
3
substance
may
not
be
used.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general,
then
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
we're
focusing
on
whether
congress
really
authorized
this
action
by
the
attorney
general.
and
in
the
raich
case,
which,
of
course,
was
a
close
case...
there
were
three
dissents
in
the
case...
the...
there
was
great
attention
on
the
fact
congress
had
considered
the
interstate
market
for
the
product
involved,
an
impact
on
the
market
if
it
was
allowed
to
be
sold
in...
or
grown
and
so
forth
in
california.
but
is
there
any
evidence
at
all
that
congress
thought
that
any
of
these...
schedule
2
or
3
substances
that
are
used
in
assisted
suicide
situations...
that
congress
focused
on
the
impact
of
that
use
on
the
interstate
market
for
those
drugs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
they
transactions
that
have
any
impact
on
any
market,
any
commercial
market,
that
congress
ever
mentioned?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--statute
goes
beyond
the
state
law,
the
five
factors,
you
know,
on
the...
justify
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--revocation.
and
some
are
in
compliance
with
state
law,
but
the
fifth
factor
is,
"such
other
conduct
which
may
threaten
the
public
health
and
safety.
"
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
clear
grant
of
authority
to
go
beyond
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
ask
this
question
concerning
the...
justice
scalia's
suggestion
that
you're
insisting
the
states
would
have
the
authority
to
act
independently
of
a
congressional
prohibition
against
the
use
of
a
substance
to
make
people
happy
and
so
forth.
isn't
your
point
in
this
case
that
congress
hasn't
really
spoken
to
the
issue
to
which
the
attorney
general
has
spoken?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
the
opposite
of
the
case
that
justice
scalia
point,
where
the
congress
has
spoken
to
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
if
the
attorney
general
determined
that
acupuncture
was
conduct
that
threatened
the
public
health
and
safety,
could
he
delicense,
or
revoke,
the
license
of
doctors
who
engaged
in
acupuncture?
