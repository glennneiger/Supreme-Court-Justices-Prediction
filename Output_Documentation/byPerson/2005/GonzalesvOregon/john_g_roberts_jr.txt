the
court
will
now
hear
argument
in
gonzales
v.
oregon.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
is
the
closest
analog
you
have,
outside
of
the
present
case,
where
the
attorney
general's
enforcement
activity
has
impinged
upon
what
the
state
has
recognized
as
medical
practice?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
the
fda.
i'm
talking
about
the
attorney
general,
under
this
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
clement.
mr.
atkinson.
on
behalf
of
respondents--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
relationship
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
has
changed
a
little
since
gibbons
versus
ogden.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
begs
the
question...
if
you
had
said
"this
specific
subject",
the
regulation
of
controlled
substances,
your
answer
would
have
come
out
the
other
way,
which
is
kind
of
what
the
case
is
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
let's...
but
the
supposition
is
that
the
state
legal
judgment
is
that
that's
the
wrong
characterization,
that
it's
legitimate
medical
practice
to
make
patients
feel
better,
and
morphine
does
that;
and
so,
the
state
can
allow
them
to
prescribe
morphine
to
make
people
feel
better.
and
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
that
would
be
permissible?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
could
not...
that's
not
prohibited
under
the
controlled--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--substances
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
that
do
to
the
effectiveness
of
regulation
under
the
controlled
substances
act?
if
one
state
can
say
it's
legal
for
doctors
to
prescribe
morphine
to
make
people
feel
better,
or
to
prescribe
steroids
for
bodybuilding,
doesn't
that
undermine
the
uniformity
of
the
federal
law
and
make
enforcement
impossible?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
may
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--may
not
be
true.
but
focus
on
the
particular
question.
if
you
have
one
state
that
allows
the
use
of
a
drug
that
the
federal
government
has
determined
is
illegal,
and
is
illegal
everywhere
else
because
other
states
haven't
done
it,
how
is
the
federal
government
supposed
to
enforce
that
prohibition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
get
at
the
specific
enforcement
point.
if
you
have
one
state
that
allows
morphine
to
be
used
legally
for--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--recreational
purposes,
how
is
the
federal
government
supposed
to
enforce
the
prohibition
on
that
elsewhere?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
do
with
regulation
1306,
which...
the
one
that,
of
course,
talks
about
"legitimate
medical
purpose"?
that
was
promulgated
in
1971.
it
wasn't
directed
to
the
oregon
statute.
and
yet
it
suggests
that
the
attorney
general
has
the
authority
to
interpret
that
phrase.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
had
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--second
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
you
had
a
second
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
in
1971
congress
didn't
assume
the
states
were
going
to
pass
legislation
for
use
of
drugs
to
assist
with
suicide,
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
clement,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
the
time--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--at
the
time
this
statute
was
passed
to
deal
with
lax
state
treatment
of
opium,
was
opium
regulated
as
part
of
medical
practice
in
any
of
the
states?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
clement.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
in
gonzales
versus
oregon.
