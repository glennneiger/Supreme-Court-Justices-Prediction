justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
that
mean
that
the
executing
officer
must
be
the
same
officer
who
got
the
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
why
he's
going
to
give
a
warrant
to
his...
some
just
call
in
a
police
officer
and
say
i
want
you
to
execute
this
warrant.
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
the
probable
cause.
he
just
says
he's
mandated
to
carry
out
the
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
affidavit
itself
says
there
is
now
concealed
a
certain
person
or
property.
he
checked
the
wrong
the
box--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
read
the
whole
affidavit,
you
know
it
doesn't
mean
what
it
says
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
with
a
warrant
to
conduct
a
wiretap,
does
the
warrant
just
merely
specify
the
telephone
number
and
the
time
at
which
the...
the
officer
may
listen,
or
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
what...
what...
the
content
of
the...
of
the
conversation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
mean
in
describing
the
authority
of
the
investigating
officer
to
execute
the
warrant,
does
it
describe
it
just
in
terms
of
a
physical
number
that
can
be
listened,
or
one
or
more
numbers,
plus
a
time
period,
or
does...
does
it
say
you
may
listen
only
when
he's
talking
about
foreign
affairs
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
a
minimization
as
to
what
they
will
transcribe,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
probability
does
not
support
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
the
person
or
property
so
described
is
now
concealed
at
the
place
for
the
issuance
of
the
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
the...
if
the
stuff
was
already
there
that
supports
the
warrant
and
the
search,
we
don't
even
reach
the
question
of
a...
of
the
anticipatory
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
should
say
i...
i've
approached
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
only
thing
we're
worried
about
is
whether...
whether
the
anticipatory
part
is
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
fair
response
to
say,
well,
we
had
other
grounds
for--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but...
but
you
would
defend
the
warrant
even
if
the
only
thing
they
were
looking
for
was
the
stuff
delivered
at
the...
at
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
to
that
aspect
of
it,
the
warrant
is
incorrect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
warrant
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
not
really
a
box.
i
am
satisfied,
et
cetera,
the
property
so
described
is
now
concealed
on
the
premises.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
the
framers
used
controlled
deliveries
either.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
if
you
take
that
view,
why
did
they
bother
to
put
the
words,
anticipatory
search
warrant,
on
the
document?
that's
what
we're
fighting
about.
if
we
decide
it
on
your
ground,
we
never
should
have
taken
cert.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
this
question?
the
warrant
now
says
it
is
now...
the
warrant
says
the
contraband
and
so
forth
is
now
concealed
on
the
person
or
in
the
house.
and
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
your
first
argument
is
it
should
have
said,
will
be
concealed
upon
the
happening
of
the
anticipatory
event.
that
would
have...
and
describe
the
event
properly.
that
would
have
satisfied
the
ninth
circuit's
objection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
why
would
that
not
also
have
satisfied
the
objection
of
the
warrant...
the
argument
you
make
in
this
court?
because
it
would
have
made
it
clear
that
there
is
now
probable
cause
to
believe
it
will
be
there
at
the
time
of
the
execution.
why
isn't
that
sufficient
to
make
the
warrant
valid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
it
also
satisfy
the
text
of
the
constitution
that
says
no
warrant
shall
issue
except
upon
probable
cause?
and
i'm
asking
you
why
is
it
not
adequate
probable
cause
to
say
we
believe
that
will
probably
happen
when
the
anticipatory
event
occurs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
has
made
a
determination
of
the
facts
that
will
establish
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that...
that
puzzles
me
a
little.
the...
the
affidavit
says
execution
will
not
take
place
until
the
event.
but
the
authority
to
search,
which
is
in
the
last
paragraph,
is
not
limited
to
the
time
after
the
anticipatory
event.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
not
even...
it
is
not
only
the
warrant,
but
the
affidavit
itself
doesn't
say
we
merely
request
permission
to
search
after
the...
after
the
event.
it's
a
general
request
for
authority
to
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm
drawing
your
attention
to
paragraphs
61
and
64
of
the
affidavit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
authority
is
broader
than
the
authority
to
search
for
those
items.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
takes
a
step
of
reasoning
beyond
merely
saying
we
incorporate
the...
the
affidavit
into
the
warrant.
