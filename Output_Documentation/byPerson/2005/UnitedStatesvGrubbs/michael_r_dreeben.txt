mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
postal
inspectors
in
this
case
applied
for
a
warrant
to
search
respondent's
property.
the
warrant
that
they
obtained
particularly
described
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
things
to
be
seized.
it
was
issued
based
on
an
affidavit
that
informed
the
magistrate
judge
that
a
videotape
containing
child
pornography
that
respondent
had
ordered
through
the
mail
and
had
paid
for
in
cash
was
going
to
be
delivered
to
respondent's
house
and
that
the
warrant
would
not
be
executed
until
the
delivery
had
taken
place.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
execution
of
this
warrant,
which
occurred
after
the
delivery
that
the
postal
inspectors
represented
would
occur
had
in
fact
happened,
violated
the
particularity
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
is
wrong
because
the
particularity
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment
addresses
two
specific
topics,
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
it
does
not
address
the
time
of
execution
of
a
warrant,
which
the
ninth
circuit
impermissibly
read
into
the
fourth
amendment
in
violation
of
its
text.
the
ninth
circuit
held,
therefore,
that
because
the
warrant
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
particularity
clause,
this
search
was
equivalent
to
a
warrantless
search
and
that
all
fruits
of
the
search
had
to
be
suppressed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
justice
souter.
in
the
government's
view,
the
warrant
clause
specifically
addresses
those
things
that
need
to
be
on
the
face
of
the
warrant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
would
prevent
the
valid
execution
of
a
warrant
that
had
no
time
limits
whatsoever
would
be
the
requirement
that
a
warrant
must
be
supported
by
probable
cause.
and
if
agents
executed
a
warrant
at
a
time
at
which
there
was
no
probable
cause,
for
example,
because
they
executed
it
before
the
delivery
had
taken
place
or
they
executed
it
after
a
time
at
which
probable
cause
had
become
stale,
the
search
would
be
unreasonable
and
the
fruits
of
the
search
would
probably
have
to
be
suppressed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it
absolutely
just
lasts
a
reasonable
time,
justice
scalia,
and
the
reason
why
there
is
very
little
law
and
very
little
litigation
on
this
is
that
since
the
1917
statute
that
congress
originally
wrote
to
provide
for
the
issuance
of
federal
search
warrants,
it's
provided
for
a
10-day
execution
period,
and
that
10-day
limit
has
been
contained
and
continued
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
so
in
the
ordinary--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i...
i
don't
want
to
say
that
there's
no
probable
cause
for
the
warrant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
there...
there
is
probable
cause
that
the
magistrate
has
to
believe
that
the
videotape,
which
was
one
of
the
items
to
be
seized,
would
be
found
at
the
premises
at
the
time
that
the
search
was
to
be
executed,
which
was
represented
in
the
affidavit
to
be
after
the
delivery
takes
place.
if,
in
fact,
the
warrant
is
executed
at
a
time
before
the
delivery
takes
place,
then
the
warrant
has
failed
to
conform
to
the
probable
cause
that
supported
it
and
the
search
would
be
unreasonable.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
because
there
is
an
independent
requirement
that
probable
cause
must
exist
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
officers
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
are
two
separate
things
that
are
going
on.
one
is
what
the
magistrate
must
do
at
the
time
that
he
issues
the
warrant.
the
magistrate
must
find
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
offense...
an
offense
has
been
committed,
is
being
committed,
or
is
about
to
be
committed,
and
that
the
items
that
the
warrant
is
going
to
request
to
be
seized
will
be
present
at
the
location
at
the
time
of
execution.
and
the
magistrate
in
this
case
was
easily
able
to
make
those
determinations
based
on
the
warrant
affidavit
that
was
submitted
to
him.
but
there
is
an
additional
requirement
of
reasonableness,
that
officers
may
not
execute
a
warrant,
even
if
it
was
validly
issued,
if
they
become
aware
of
facts
that
would
tell
a
reasonable
officer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i...
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
the
easiest
example
to...
to
see
why
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i...
what
i...
i'm
making
a
separate
point
here,
which
is
that
officers
have
a
continuing
obligation
to
act
reasonably
in
the
execution
of
a
warrant,
and
of
course,
they
fulfill
that
in
a
variety
of
ways.
they
have
to
be
reasonable
in
identifying
the
property
that's...
that's
specified
in
the
warrant
and
that
they
go
to
search.
they
have
to
be
reasonable
in
conducting
the
search
of
places
within
that
property
to
see
that
they're
looking
for
the
things
that
are
specified
in
the
warrant
and
not
going
on
a
fishing
expedition
for
things
that
are
not.
they
have
to
be
reasonable
in
deciding
whether
they
decide
to
dispense
with
knock
and
announce,
and
they
also
have
to
be
reasonable
in
deciding
that
the
basis
for
probable
cause
that
they
used
to
support
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
has
not
become
so
stale
that
a
reasonable
officer
would
know
that
that
warrant
should
not
be
executed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
it
certainly
doesn't,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
i
think
in
the
ordinary
instance,
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
team
of
executing
officers
to
be
responsible
for
the
inquiry
that
i'm
talking
about
and
any
individual
officer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
warrant
is
obtained
based
on
an
affidavit
by--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--oh,
i
don't
think
it's
a
big
change
at
all,
justice
kennedy,
and
i...
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
make
clear
here
is
that
there's
an
ongoing
obligation
of
reasonableness.
certainly
the
court
does
not
have
to
get
into
that
in
this
case
to
decide
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
in
this
case,
justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
affidavit
was
on
the
scene.
the
affiant
who
secured
the
warrant
was
the
lead
agent
who
was
in
charge
of
the
search
that
was
carried
out.
the
search
team
had
been
briefed
on
the
probable
cause
and
the...
the
contents
of
the
affidavit
and
the...
the
items
that
were
to
be
searched
for
and
when
the
search
was
to
take
place.
all
of
those
things
were
true.
the
district
court
also
found
that
the
affidavit,
which
does
contain
the
triggering
condition
in
two
different
places,
was
incorporated
into
the
warrant.
the
search
warrant
itself
refers
to
the
attached
affidavit.
so
the
documents--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
was
not...
it
was
not
physically
attached.
it
was
in
the
possession--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
in
the
abstract,
i
suppose
that
that's
right,
but
in...
in
the
concrete
circumstances
of
this
case...
and
i
think
it's
consistent
with
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
is
reasonable
search
warrant
execution...
all
of
the
search
team
was
fully
familiar
with
the
process
that
was
going
on.
this...
this
was
a
controlled
delivery
in
which
postal
inspectors
were
arranging
themselves
to
make
a
delivery
to
the
premises
of
the
videotape
in
question.
everyone
on
the
search
warrant
team
knew
that
until
that
item
had
been
received
and
taken
inside
the
house,
there
would
be
no
warrant
execution.
and
in
fact--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
point
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
what
the
point
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
is
that
the
magistrate
judge
makes
a
determination
whether
the
facts
that
are
submitted
to
him
rise
to
the
level
of
probable
cause.
and
then
the
magistrate
writes
a
warrant
that's
consistent
with
what
the
fourth
amendment
says
in
terms
the
warrant
clause
requires.
then
the
police
officers
have
to
be
reasonable
in
executing
it.
that
was
really
my
only
point
at
the
outset
of
the
colloquy
that
i
had
with
justice
kennedy
and
with
justice
souter.
and
the
classic
example
that
i
think
shows
that
certainly
officers
may
use
discretion
in
what
they
do
in
determining
whether
it's
certain
types
of
triggering
conditions
are
met
are
wiretaps
because
wiretaps
are
issued
on
the
basis
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
criminal
conversations
will
occur
in
the
future.
the
officers
then
have
the
responsibility
to
conduct
appropriate
electronic
surveillance
that
acquires
the
criminal
conversations
but
not
other
conversations
that
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
probable
cause
that
they've
obtained.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
point,
justice
souter,
is
that
they
have
to
make
a
judgment
that
criminal
conversations
are
what
is
going
to
be
intercepted.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
they're...
they're
not
judgments
here
about
probable
cause
either
because
the
magistrate
has--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that's
a
separate
question,
and
i
think
the
magistrate's
question
is,
is
there
probable
cause?
he
doesn't
have
to
determine
that
the
probable
cause
is
true.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
actually,
justice
souter--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i...
i
have
to
say
that
i
disagree
fundamentally
with
the
suggestion
that
he's
saying
there
will
be
probable
cause
when
the
triggering
event
occurs.
he's
saying,
based
on
the
facts
that
are
submitted
to
me
now,
the
probabilities
are
such
that
evidence
of
this
crime
will
be
on
the
property
when
the
warrant
is
executed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
reason
linguistically
to
prefer
your
formulation,
justice
souter,
to
the
formulation
that
says
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
now
that
when
the
warrant
is
executed,
in
accordance
with
the
triggering
condition's
occurrence,
the
property
will
be
found.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
warrant
should
be
read
as
a
whole
and
not,
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
many
cases,
a
technical
sense.
this
search
warrant,
which
is
at
page
47a
of
the
petition
appendix,
specifically
refers
to
the
attached
affidavit.
and
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
warrant
was
intended
to
incorporate
the
affidavit.
the
affidavit
states
quite
explicitly
in
two
different
places
that
it
would
not
be
executed
until
the
triggering
event
occurred,
and
it
also
makes
clear
that
the
triggering
event
was
the
delivery
of
the
videotape
that
respondent--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
the...
that
is
correct,
too,
because
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
not
only
do
you
know
that
the...
this
was
clearly
intended
to
be
an
anticipatory
warrant
as
to
the
videotape,
but
it
also
authorized
the
search
for
other
items
that
were
related
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--wiretaps,
justice
stevens,
are
regulated
extensively
by
federal
statute,
and
under
federal
statute,
a
wiretap
order
contains
a
myriad
of
details
that
are
not
specified
by
the
fourth
amendment.
among
those
details
are
the
crimes
that
are
being
investigated
and
the
time
period
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
specifies
the
crimes
that
are
being
investigated
and
it
contains
a
minimization
requirement
which--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
a
minimization
as
to
what
conversations
they
will
intercept
if
they
listen
to
a
conversation
and
determine
that
it
falls
outside
the
scope
of
what
they're
authorized
to
intercept.
many
of
the
calls
that...
that
are
intercepted
in
these
kinds
of
wiretaps
require
a
considerable
amount
of
judgment
and
discretion.
are
the
individuals
talking
in
code?
are
they
talking
about
crimes
in
an
oblique
way
that
pertain
to
the
subject
of
the
warrant,
or
are
they
really
having
innocent
conversations?
and
the
officers
can
listen
in
long
enough
to
make
that
determination.
if
they
determine
that
it's
a
clean
call,
they
have
to
minimize
and
terminate
their
interceptions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
i...
i
would
certainly
with
respect
to
search
of
common
areas.
for
example,
this
was
a
delivery
to
some
sort
of
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i'm
saying
that
there
would
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
one
seventeenth
is
pushing
it
for
probable
cause--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--which
is
why
my
answer
was
as
to
the
common
area.
certainly
they
can
get
a
warrant
that
says
we
know
that
there's
an
item
that
represents
evidence
of
a
crime
and
that
it's
going
to
be
at
a
particular
location
upon
delivery
and
we
can
go
in
and
search
that
location.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
with...
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
invading
the
individual
expectations
of
privacy
of...
of
50--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i...
i
wouldn't
because
i
don't
think
that...
that
one
fiftieth
in
those
circumstances
would...
would
be
probable
cause
without
more.
i...
i
do
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
case
is
different
because
there...
you...
you
can
subtract
out
all
of
the
variables
except
will
the
postal
officials,
in
fact,
deliver
it
to
the
place
where
they're
saying
they
will
deliver
it
and
they
say
that
they're
delivering
it
to
a
household
that
has
actually
placed
the
order.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
then
the...
then
the
warrant
should
not
be
executed
because
this
affidavit
said
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
that...
it's
fair
to
say
that
it's
not
100
percent
controlled
by
the
postal
service,
but
i
wouldn't
say
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
are
left
up
in
the
air
or
that
there's
any
more
that's
left
up
in
the
air
than
in
the
kind
of
experience
that
goes
on
in
installing
a
wiretap.
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not
under
this
warrant
because
it
was
secured
by
an
affidavit
that
represented
that
it...
the
warrant
will
not
be
executed
unless
and
until
the
item
is
taken
inside
the
house.
and
so
the
agents
assumed
the
risk,
so
to
speak,
that
the
event
that
you
described,
justice
ginsburg,
would
occur,
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
search
wouldn't
take
place.
presumably
under
those
circumstances
an
arrest
would
take
place.
a
search
would
take
place
incident
to
the
arrest
of
the
individual.
the
videotape
would
be
found,
and
the
government
would
have
acquired
the
evidence
that
it's
looking
for,
which
is
evidence
with
jury
appeal
that
this
individual
has,
in
fact,
received
child
pornography
through
the
mail.
and
it's
important
to
recognize
that
in
this
case
there
was
ample
probable
cause
that
respondent
had
attempted
to
receive
child
pornography
through
the
mail
before
the
triggering
event
even
took
place,
and
had
the
agents
wished
to,
they
could
have
procured
a
warrant,
a
conventional
warrant,
so
to
speak,
at
that
time
that
allowed
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
this
was
such
a
warrant,
justice
scalia.
i'm...
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
there
was
a
chain
of
events
that
supported
probable
cause
to
a
very
strong
degree
and
the
triggering
event
represented
that
until
the
actual
delivery
had
taken
place
and
the
item
was
brought
in
the
house,
the
search
wouldn't
take
place.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's...
it's
fundamentally
different.
this
case
is
fundamentally
different
from
that
hypothetical
because
the
measure
of
probable
cause
at
the
time
the
warrant
is
issued
is
very
weak
under
justice
scalia's
hypothetical.
one
out
of
17
is
pushing
the
envelope.
one
out
of
50,
at
least
absent
some
extraordinary
national
emergency,
is
probably
well
outside
the
envelope
for
saying
we
have
probable
cause
to
go
into
any
particular
place.
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
illustrates
that
the
emergence
of
later
facts
can
make
it
very
clear
that
the
agents
can
go
in
and
get
probable
cause
at
that
moment,
but
this
case
is
fundamentally
different
because
the
agents
have
probable
cause
based
on
probabilities.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
and
those
fact--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i...
i
think
this
takes
me
back
to
the
fact
that
this
warrant,
number
one,
should
be
construed
as
a
whole
and
not...
not
by
virtue
of
which
box
was
checked
and,
number
two,
that
there
were
many
items
that
were
specified
in
the
warrant
that...
and
the
warrant
application
that
the
agent
had
reason
to
believe
were
then
concealed
at
the
time.
so
this
was
really
a
case
where
the
form
warrant
was
inadequate
to
the...
to
describe
fully
and
accurately
what
was
going
on.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
you
do
in--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
it's
a...
it's
a
fair
response
into...
on
how
the
warrant
was
drawn
and
why
the
statements
that
were
made
are
not
laughably
wrong.
they...
they
are
partially
inaccurate
because
the
videotape
was
clearly
not
on
the
premises
at
the
time.
they
are
partially
right
in
that
other
evidence
of
child
pornography
distribution
was.
but
this
case...
and,
justice
stevens,
i
quite
agree
with
you.
this
case
only
concerns
the
triggering
condition
because
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
and
that's
the
only
thing
that's
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the...
the
box
on
the
warrant
is.
again,
i
think
that
you
need
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
same
response
that
i
gave
to
justice
kennedy.
the
magistrate
found
that
the
warrant,
the
form
of...
that
constitutes
the
warrant,
incorporated
the
attached
affidavit,
and
the
attached
affidavit
makes
clear
exactly
what
the
agent
had
in
mind.
there
is
an
alternative
point
here
that
i
want
to
make
before
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
and
that
is
the
ninth
circuit's
position,
even
if
the
ninth
circuit
were
correct
that
the
triggering
condition
needs
to
be
in
the
warrant,
should
still
not
lead
to
the
suppression
of
evidence
because
although
the
government's
submission
is
that
the
triggering
condition
is
not
required
by
the
particularity
clause,
if
some
other
doctrine
under
the
fourth
amendment
did
require
it
to
be
in
the
warrant,
the
warrant
should
be
treated
as
one
that
is
at
most
overbroad
as
to
the
time
of
permissible
execution.
that
is,
on
its
face
it
would
authorize
the
warrant
to
be
executed
from
the
moment
of
issuance
until
10
days
after
issuance
instead
of
from
the
moment
that
the
triggering
condition
is
satisfied
until
10
days
after
issuance.
when
courts
have
confronted
overbroad
warrants,
what
they
have
done
is
ask
is
there
probable
cause
that
supports
part
of
this
warrant.
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
the
next
question
is,
is
the
evidence
that's
sought
to
be
suppressed
acquired
under
the
part
of
the
warrant
that
was
validly
supported
by
probable
cause?
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
there's
no
suppression.
the
warrant
is,
in
effect,
severed
and
the
only
suppression
that
can
be
obtained
is
as
to
evidence
that
was
secured
by
execution
of
the
part
of
the
warrant
that's
not
supported
by
probable
cause.
here,
there
was
ample
probable
cause
to
support
the
magistrate
judge's
conclusion
that
after
the
triggering
condition
was
satisfied,
the
videotape
would
be
on
the
premises.
the
warrant
was
not
executed
until
after
the
delivery
of
the
videotape
took
place,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
deficiency
in
the
correlation
between
probable
cause
showings
that
were
made
to
obtain
the
warrant
and
the
time
at
which
it
was
executed.
and
the
result
is
that
there
should
be
no
suppression
of
evidence.
if
i
may
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
scalia,
because
the
representations
that
are
made
to
the
magistrate
to
secure
the
warrant
include
the
fact
that
the
warrant
will
not
be
executed
and
the
agents
should--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
true
because
i
think
that
the
magistrate
is
making
the
common
sense
judgment
that
this
will
be...
we
don't
know
exactly
when--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
makes
the
representation,
and
i
think
what
draws
the
link
between
the
conditions
that
are
represented
to
occur
before
the
warrant
will
be
executed
and
the
warrant
itself
are
paragraphs
1,
2,
and
3
of
the
items
that
are
to
be
seized
because
those
pertain--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
understand
that,
justice
stevens.
but
the...
the
items
to
be
seized
include
the
videotape
and
its
containers
which
are
paragraphs
1,
2,
and
3.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
true.
but
those
items...
the
magistrate
can
conclude
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they'll
be
on
the
premises
only
after
delivery
has
taken
place.
and
the
magistrate
has
issued
the
warrant,
and
the
three
principal
items
at
the
top
are
those
things.
so
it's
logical
to
conclude
that
the
magistrate
formed
the
view
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
these
items
will
be
on
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it
takes
a
very
small
step
of
logical
inference,
but
i
agree
with
you,
justice
stevens,
that
it
doesn't
say
everything
that
is
logically
implied
in
the
magistrate's
probable
cause
finding.
but
the
magistrate's
probable
cause
finding
is
predicated
on
the
view
that
the
items
will
be
there
because
the
postal
service
has
represented
they'll
deliver
them.
the
burden
of
the
ninth
circuit's
view
is
that
the
particularity
clause
applies
to
the
triggering
condition
and
mandates
that
it
be
stated
in
the
text
even
though
the
fourth
amendment's
text
doesn't
contain
that
requirement.
this
court
in
dalia
v.
united
states
rejected
a
similar
effort
to
add
a
requirement
to
a
warrant
that
would
authorize
surreptitious
entry
to
install
a
covert
bugging
device,
and
the
court's
reasoning
in
dalia
makes
clear
that
the
court
was
unwilling
to
go
on
a
progressive
path
of
reading
things
into
the
fourth
amendment's
particularity
clause
that
are
not
there.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
want
the
court
to
send
it
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
impose
yet
new
requirements
on
the
execution
of
warrants.
[laughter]
what
i
want
the
court
to
hold
is
that
the
triggering
condition
in
an
anticipatory
warrant
is
not
subsumed
in
the
particularity
clause
and
therefore
it
need
not
be
in
the
face
of
the
warrant
at
all.
and
alternatively,
if
the
court
believed
that
it
did,
that
a
warrant
that's
executed
after
the
triggering
condition
has
occurred,
does
not
require
suppression
of
evidence.
thank
you.
