what
would
prevent
the
issuance
of
just
a
blanket
warrant?
we
have
a
warrant
for
this...
for
this
premises
to
be
searched.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
they
become
aware,
but
the...
it's
a
big
leap
from
that
to
say
that
they
must
make
their
own
determination
of
probable
cause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
indicated
a
warrant
can't
be
served
unless
they
determine
there's
probable
cause,
but
that's
for
the
magistrate
to
do,
as
justice
scalia--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
there's
no...
there's
no
authority
for
that.
i...
i
thought
warrants
were
issued
to
police
officers
all
the
time
without
knowing
the...
the
precise
reason.
it's
to
search
the
house
to
try
to
find
x,
and
the
warrant
speaks
for
itself.
a
judge
has
made
that
determination.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
if
you
want
us
to
write
the
opinion
with
this
qualification
in
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
making
a
big
change
in
the
way
search
warrants
are
used.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
that's
not
what
the...
what
the
warrant
says.
the
warrant
says
i'm
satisfied
that
the
person
or
the
property
so
described
is
now
concealed
on
the
premises.
