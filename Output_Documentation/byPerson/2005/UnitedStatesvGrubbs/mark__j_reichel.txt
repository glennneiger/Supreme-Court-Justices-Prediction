mr.
mark
j.
reichel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may...
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
to
begin
with
noting
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
highlighted
a
specific
concern
with
anticipatory
warrants
and
a
specific
concern
specific
to
this
type
of
case.
a
discussion
was...
was
had
about
triggering
events
are
commonly
not
so
clean.
it
requires
a
lot
of
judgment
to
be
made
by
the
officer
in
the
field.
there
are
not
only
examples
in
the
case
law,
but
i
speak
from
my
own
experience
as
a
public
defender
of
many
years
that
there
are
many
examples
that
occur
often
in
the
courtroom.
specifically
a
triggering
condition
may
allow
for
the
search
of
a
home
after
a
suspect
sells
narcotics
to
an
officer,
but
what
will
happen
is
the
suspect
will
take
the
money
from
the
officer
and
then
have
to
go
to
another
residence
to
get
the
narcotics,
not
the
residence
that
the
magistrate
and
the
officer
believe
he
would
get
them
from.
as
a
result,
he
has
to
make
a
determination
at
that
point
whether
the
triggering
condition
has
been
satisfied.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
yes,
because
the
magistrate
has
determined
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
at
the
time
of
the
search,
the
contraband,
the
purpose
of
the
search,
will
be
present
in
that
particularly
described
location.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
justice
scalia,
what
the
magistrate
is
predicting
is
that
there
will
be
receipt,
but
the
magistrate
is...
is
not
predicting
that
there
will
be
contraband
inside
of
that
house
at
that
point.
he's
actually
shipping
that
discretion
to
the
officer
in
the
field.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
it
is
probable
that
he's
going
to
be
receiving
it.
however,
what
occurred...
what...
the...
the
problem
that
occurs
in
such
a
situation
is
that
is
that
the
warrant
issuing
process
itself,
which
is
part
of
the
machinery
of
government...
the
actual
process
of
issuance
is
completed
with
anticipatory
warrants
by
the
officer
in
the
field.
it's
not
fair
to
say
that
the
warrant
has
been
issued
and
the
magistrate
provides
it
to
the
officer.
at
that
point,
it's
not
a
valid
warrant.
a
warrant
cannot
be
issued
if
it's
not
valid
by
definition.
so
what
you
have--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--that
is
correct,
and
i'm...
and,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
why
telephonic
warrants
are
simple
and
easy,
one
of
the
many
alternatives
to
anticipatory
warrants,
which
do
not
require
any--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--yes,
there
is,
justice
ginsburg.
and
the
procedure...
the
most
appropriate
procedure
is
the
duplicate
warrant
whereby
the
magistrate,
satisfying
all
the
concerns
your
honor
has
expressed,
has
this
warrant.
as
to
the
final
matter,
the
final
determination
of
probable
cause,
he
receives
a
call
from
the
officer.
there's
an
agent
with
the
magistrate
at
the
time.
he
advises
what's
just
occurred.
he
can
advise
he
took
the
package
but
did
not
go
in
the
house.
he
took
the
package
and
did
go
in
the
house.
the
magistrate
has
the
64-page
affidavit,
is
all
prepared
now.
he
can
advise
the
officer
to
sign
off
on
it,
that
it's
okay
to
search
now.
he
signed
that--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--well
before
the
delivery
of
the
package
in
such
a
circumstance,
your
honor.
they
bring
a
duplicate...
a
duplicate
warrant
to
the
magistrate
who...
and
they...
and
there's
an
agent
who
stays
with
the
magistrate.
they
then
control...
are
in
complete
control
at
this
point
of
the
contraband.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
your
honor,
if
i...
justice
o'connor,
if
i
can
elaborate.
it
was
raised
in
the
district
court,
and
in
fact,
i
believe
it's
in
the
joint
appendix.
excuse
me.
it's
in
the
cert
petition
at
page
36a,
which
i
think
is
appendix
d,
where
the
district
court
finds
that
they're
permissible,
and
he
cites
weber
and
hale.
and
the
district
judge
at
that
point
made
a
final
determination
for
the
litigation
in
the
district
court
that
they
were
permissible
and
they
were
lawful
in
all
circumstances.
i
did
not...
the
matter
on
appeal
to
the
ninth...
the
court
of
appeals
on
appeal,
the
more
surer
course
that
we
thought
for
reversal
would
be
the
failure
of
particularity
of
these
types
of
requirements.
but
the
most
important
point
is
i
do
believe
it's
fairly
included
in
the
question
presented
before
this
court.
several
examples,
long
discussion,
lots
of
confusion
about
what
must...
what
procedure
must
take
place
with
anticipatory
warrants
i
think
calls
out
for
the
inferior
courts
to
hear
from
this
court
what
those
requirements
are.
to
answer
what
those
requirements
are,
this
court
must
answer
whether
they're
constitutional--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--textually
he...
textually
under
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment,
he
cannot
issue
the
warrant
for
service
at
6:30
when
probable
cause--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--if
it...
if
it
is
textually
okay,
if
the
warrant
is
valid
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
it
must
be
clearly
stated
that
the
time
and
the...
and
the
significant
limit
on
the
officer's
power
to
search
is
the
time
of
6:30,
that
must
be
clearly
stated
on
the
warrant
to
satisfy
the
particularity
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
it
must
be
on
there.
it
is
a
requirement
under
the
particularity
clause
that
it
must
be
on
there
for
the
officer--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--it
is
inherent.
it
is
inherent
in
that
language.
it
is
backed
up...
clearly
it
is
backed
up
by
the
purposes
behind
the
particularity
clause.
if
a
warrant...
the
probable
cause...
the...
the
two
clauses
in
the
warrant
clause,
the
probable
cause,
is
constitutionally
i
believe
joined
at
the
hip.
it
is
textually
joined
with
the
objects
of
the
search,
the
place
to
be
searched,
and
the...
and
the
persons
to
be
searched.
and
as
a
result--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--yes.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
o'connor,
i
do
know
that
the...
that
wiretap
statutes
came
about
only
after
three
important
decisions
from
this
court,
ker
v.
california,
katz,
and
berger.
and
in...
in
those
opinions,
they
dealt...
they
dealt
very
strongly
with
the
particularity
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
wiretap
restrictions.
thereafter,
there
were
extensive
congressional
hearings
on
wiretaps
and
the
final
result
was
a
very
carefully
drafted
statute
that
allowed
for
wiretap,
subject
to...
to
very
stringent
conditions,
specifically
enumerated...
enumerated
crimes
and
specific
circumstances,
but
additionally,
notice
to
the
homeowner--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--and
i...
and
i
believe
that
wiretap
laws...
the
wiretap
laws
require
a
showing
of
present
probable
cause,
not
probable
cause
in
the
future.
but
there
is
criminality
ongoing
at
this
time.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
i
believe
this
court
announced
in--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--i
believe
in...
in...
this
court
announced,
justice
o'connor,
in
the
berger
opinion
that
for
a
wiretap
warrant
to
be
authorized
under
the
fourth
amendment,
there
must
be
a
crime
undertaken,
presently
being
committed,
or
about
to
be
committed,
additional
evidence
of
a
crime
that's
already
been
committed.
there
is
present
probable
cause.
and
it
also,
i
do
not
believe,
vests
the
discretion
in
the
officers
to
completely
control
when
probable
cause
will
occur.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
wiretaps
are
different
for
a
few
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
do
not
believe
they
could
have
been
foreseen
by
the
framers
of
the
fourth
amendment.
as
a
result,
more
pragmatic
modern
approaches
for
law
enforcement's
needs
must
be
taken
into
consideration.
but
additionally--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
the
particularity
requirement
requires
specificity
on
the
purposes
behind
the
particularity
requirement
in
the
warrant
itself
and
not
in
some
other
documents
or
supporting
documents
elsewhere.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
justice...
justice
breyer,
it
says
that
they
may
enter
into
that
house,
but
only
upon
the
occurrence
of
a
significant
event,
a
specific
occurrence.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
that
is
in
the
affidavit--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--well,
it--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--justice--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--justice
breyer,
i
think
that
highlights
and
it
supports
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case,
specifically
because
if
it's
not
stated
on
the
face
of
the
warrant,
such
as--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--the
limit
on
the
officers'
power
to
search.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
their
limit
is
in
the
triggering
event.
it
is
an
anticipatory
warrant
which
is
written
at
the
top.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
yes.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
and,
justice
breyer,
the
limitation
for
the
officer
is
a
significant
matter.
it
is
the
only
thing
that
gives
him
the--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--i
believe
the
particularity
requirement
also
does
not
assume
that
the
officers
seeking
the
warrant
will
be
the
officers
serving
the
warrant.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
they
are
joined
at
the
hip
because
the...
the
particularity
requirement--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--if
there's
a...
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there's
a
significant
limit
on
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
warrant,
then
that
does
become
part
of
the
particularity
clause.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
not
that
i...
if
it
is
significant...
if
it
is
a
significant
limit
on
the
officer's
power
to
search
and
if
it
serves
the
other
purposes
of
the
particularity
requirement,
the
measurement
of
the...
providing
the
homeowner
the
notice
of
what
is
going
on.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
the
reasonableness
prong
is
separate,
and
i
think
this
court
has...
has
long
pronounced
that
the
manner
of
executing
a
warrant
may
offend
the
constitution
and
vitiate
the
legality
of
a
search.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
the
manner
of
entry...
the
method
of
entry
does
not
have
to
be
spelled
out.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
i
believe
that
not
for...
for
all
cases,
i
cannot
answer
the
question,
but
for
cases
of
anticipatory
search
warrants
where
the
officers
are
going
to
finalize
the
issuing
process,
the
officers
are
completely
in
control
of
the
manufacture
and
completely
in
control
of
the
completion
of
the
delivery
of
the
contraband,
and
if
a
magistrate
has
allowed
them
to
make
that
decision
in
the
field,
that
has
to
be
clearly
stated
to
satisfy
the
particularity
requirement
on
the
front
page
of
the
warrant
so
that
any
officer
executing
it,
not
just
those
who...
who
seek
the
warrant,
but
the
officer
executing
it,
is
keenly
aware
of
his
limit
to
search.
as
well,
it
puts
the
homeowner
on
notice
of
the
other
factors
of
the
particularity
requirement
that
this
has
announced
in--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--the
groh
v.
ramirez
opinion.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
that...
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
it
will
make
the
warrant
valid
under
the
particularity
clause.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
because
the
text
of
the...
of
the
probable
cause
requirement
in
the
fourth
amendment
has
clearly
been
announced
by
this
court
to
always
require
the
magistrate's
determination
of
the
facts,
as
well
as
the
legal
grounds,
after
studied
caution
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
he
has,
justice
stevens,
but
he
has
ceded
his
discretion
to
finalize
that...
to
finalize
that
decision.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
that
does
not--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--justice
breyer,
they
are
prone
to
abuse
by
nature.
they
are--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--thank
you,
justice
breyer.
in
groh
v.
ramirez,
this
court
set
forth
very
clearly
that
the
purpose
of
the
particularity
requirement
serves
two
functions.
one
is
for
law
enforcement;
the
second
is
for
the
homeowner.
and
for
law
enforcement,
it
is
very
clear
in
these...
this
court's
decisions
that
that
must
be
so
that
the
officer
executing
it
can
simply
and
quickly
and
efficiently
determine
the
limits
of
their
power
to
search.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
justice
scalia,
i...
i
can...
it
is
inherent
in
the
place,
the
objects,
and
the
persons
to
be
searched
in
a
particularity--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--that's
correct.
with
regard
to
anticipatory
warrants,
time
is
part
of
the
particularity
requirement.
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
warrant,
the
time
of
the
determination
of
probable
cause
that
contraband
will
be
present,
the
time
of
the
determination
of
probable
cause,
which
is
the
triggering
event,
which
comes
from
the
fourth
amendment
itself--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
that
might
happen.
exigent
circumstances
in
the
execution
of
a
warrant
were
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
justice...
justice
ginsburg,
yes,
i
would.
and
i
think
at
that
point
the
officers
would
also
have
to
leave
the
final
determination
as
to
whether
probable
cause
has
been
completed
to
the
magistrate
through
the
use
of
many
alternatives,
including
a
telephonic
warrant
where
the--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
well,
specifically
what
was
highlighted
in
this
case
is
that
the
individual
receiving
the
package
was
his
wife,
justice
ginsburg.
and
it's...
it's
clear
in
the
record
that
she
received
it.
moments
later,
they
rushed
in.
the
first
thing
she
said
to
the
officers
is
what
is
going
on
here
and
why
are
you
here?
what
is
going
on
here?
why
are
you
here?
at
that
point,
i
believe
clearly
under...
under
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
and
other
court
decisions,
that
this
crime,
the
knowing
receipt
of
the
illegal
material,
had
not
been
completed.
there
had
been
no
crime
committed
at
that
point.
and
there
was
no...
no
knowing
receipt
of
the
illegality
of
this.
there's
never
been
any
evidence--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--he
was
inside
the--
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
--justice
ginsburg,
he
was
inside
the
house,
and
he
walked
outside
thereafter.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
they
did,
justice
scalia.
now,
but
they
did
enter
the
house
prior...
they
entered
the
house
prior
to
a
lawful
triggering
condition.
in
such
an
example,
they
could
have
contacted
the
magistrate
immediately,
advised
what
had
happened,
who
would
have
realized
at
that
point
that
a
crime
had
not
been
committed,
that
there
was
not
probable
cause
that
this
crime,
the
knowing
receipt,
had
been
committed.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
but
this
does...
justice
souter,
this
highlights
why
the
triggering
event
must
be
clearly,
specifically
drawn
by
a
magistrate
with
studied
caution
about
the
exact
factors
for
probable
cause
which
would
allow
this
search.
and
if
it's
buried
in
some
affidavit
somewhere,
if
it's
not
on
the
front
of
the
warrant,
or
if
it's
vested
in
the
discretion
of
the
officer
to
make
that
determination
whether
that's
close
enough,
then
it
is
prone
to
these
abuses
and
it
is...
requires
the
magistrate
to
make
that
final
legal
determination.
mr.
mark
j.
reichel
thank
you.
