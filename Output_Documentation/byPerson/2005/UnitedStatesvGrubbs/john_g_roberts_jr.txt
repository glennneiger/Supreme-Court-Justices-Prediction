chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
no.
04-1414,
united
states
v.
grubbs.
general
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
short
while
ago
that
if
it
were
executed
before
the
triggering
event,
it
would
be
invalid
because
there
was
no
probable
cause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
you
don't
because
then
the
warrant
shouldn't
have
issued.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
facts
of
the
triggering
event
are
not
always
going
to
be
so
clean,
and
in
many
cases
they're
going
to
require
an
exercise
of
judgment
by
the
officer.
i
mean,
if
the
triggering
event
is
a,
you
know,
delivery
of
a
bale
of
marijuana
or
something
and
they
see
a
big
box
coming
in,
they're
going
to
have
say,
well,
is
that
what
they're
talking
about
or
is...
you
know,
is
that
it.
and
the
point
is
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
those
types
of
judgments
are
supposed
to
be
made
by
the
magistrate
and
not
by
the
officers
on
the
scene.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
there's
no...
there's
no
probable
cause
until
the
triggering
event.
when...
when
the
triggering
event
takes
place,
you've
eliminated
the
16
others
and
you
do
know
that
it's...
it's...
there's
probable
cause.
how
is
that
different
from
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
true.
maybe
the...
maybe
the
person
decides
he
won't
accept
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
are
a
lot
more
things
than
just
the
delivery.
it's
not
entirely
controlled
by
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
elaborate
just
a
little
bit
for
me
on
why
you
think
this
case
is
different
from
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
with
the
17
people?
because
my
concern
is
there...
here
you
say
once
the
triggering
event
takes
place,
then
you
do...
the
probable
cause
comes
to
fruition
or
whatever.
how
is
that
different
than
his
hypothetical?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
reichel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
else
is
there
in
this
joined
at
the
hip
particularity
requirement?
the
number
of
officers?
which
officers,
fbi
agents
or
dea
or
something
else?
i
mean,
you're...
you're
adding
to
the
text
of
the
amendment,
and
i
just
wonder
what
else
is
added
under
your
view.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
that's
your
argument.
i'm
just
saying
what
else
is
joined
at...
at
the
hip
besides
time.
you
say
they
don't
say
time.
they
say
persons
to
be
seized
and
place
to
be
searched,
and
you
say
inherent
in
that
is
time.
well,
what
else
is
inherent
in
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
time.
is
there
anything
else
that's
not
written
there
that
is
part
of
that
particularity
requirement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there's
all
sorts
of,
as
mr.
dreeben
explained,
reasonableness.
it
doesn't
say
how
you
enter
the
house,
but
if
you
suddenly
go
in
with
a...
with
a
tank,
we
might
find
that
unreasonable.
but
that's
not
something
that
has
to
be
spelled
out
particularly
under
the
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
spelled
out
in
the
warrant
itself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
in
04-1414,
united
states
versus
grubbs.
