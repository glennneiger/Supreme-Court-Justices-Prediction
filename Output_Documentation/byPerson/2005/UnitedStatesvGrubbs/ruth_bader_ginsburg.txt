the
affidavit...
wasn't
the
affidavit
available
to
the
executing
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what...
what...
take
this
variable.
the...
the
warrant
can
be
executed
when
the
item
is
taken
into
the
house,
if
i
remember
what
it
said.
suppose
the
defendant
is
sitting
on
a
porch,
sees
the
postal
carrier,
gets
up,
takes
the
package,
and
proceeds
to
walk
down
the
street,
and
never
enters
the
house.
could
the
warrant
be
executed?
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
reichel,
one
of
the
concerns
about
the
position
you're
taking,
the
alternative
would
be
that
the
police
officer,
expecting
that
this
package
is
going
to
be
delivered
at
a
certain
time,
is
on
the
lookout
for
it.
he
sees
the
post
officer
approaching,
calls
on
his
cell
phone
to
get
an
emergency
warrant,
let's
say.
the
magistrate
will
not
be
nearly
as
well
informed
as
he
was
when
he
was
presented
with...
was
it
a
64-paragraph
affidavit?
so
the
magistrate
knows
that
the
whole
deal...
he
can't
possibly
know
it
if
he's
got...
got
a
telephone
call
on
an
urgent
basis.
so
if
you
want
the
magistrate's
judgment
rather
than
the
police
officers'
on
the
spot,
then
it
makes
much
more
sense
to
have
the
magistrate
get
a
detailed
picture
of
what's
going
on
and
decide
whether
or
not
he'll
issue
the
warrant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
just...
i
made
the
opposite
argument,
that
a
telephone
warrant
has
to
be
done
on
the
basis
of
minimum
information.
the
officer...
the
magistrate
will
have
a
detailed
affidavit
when
it
isn't
on
an
emergency
basis.
he...
he
will
have,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
an
affidavit
with
64
paragraphs
explaining
the
whole
deal,
how
it
was
set
up.
so
isn't...
isn't
there
greater
security
if
you
could
have
a
magistrate
with
time
to
think,
well,
is
there
really
probable
cause
than
to
have
the
magistrate
make
that
judgment
on
a...
such
a
quick
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
has
to
be...
when
does
he
get
the...
when
does
the
magistrate
get
the
affidavit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where...
where
is
time?
i
know
that
the
fourth
amendment
says
persons
and
places.
where
does
it
say
time
is
one
of
the
particulars?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
time...
time
is
certainly
relevant
to
probable
cause,
but
the...
the
fourth
amendment
says
what
you
have
to
identify
with
particularity
are
places
and
the
items
and
the
person.
person,
things,
and
place.
it
doesn't
say
time,
but
you
say
that's
inherent.
have
we...
are
there
decisions
of
this
court
that
say
time
goes
to
the
particularity
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
have
first
the
outer
limit
of
the
10
days
in
the
warrant
itself.
and
in
fact,
this
warrant
was
executed
within
2
days
of
its
issuance.
is
that
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
could
it
be
if
the
officer
knows
that
this
package...
let's
say
it's
loaded
with
dynamite
or
guns
or
drugs...
is
going
to
be
delivered
at
a
certain
time
and
it...
the
delivery
occurs,
and
then
the
officer
busts
in
and
says,
there's
exigent
circumstances.
they're
going
to
take
those
drugs
and
they'll
be
off
the
premises.
that
might
happen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
my...
my
question
is,
isn't
it
better
to
have
the
police
go
to
the
magistrate
when
there's
time
for
the
magistrate
to
reflect,
than
to
have
this
scenario
where
the
police
will
say
this
was
really
dangerous
stuff,
exigent
circumstances?
wouldn't
you
want
the
officer
to
apply
in
advance
for
the
warrant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even...
wasn't
this
man...
magistrate
told
we've
set
this
whole
thing
up?
we've
put
this
package
in
the
mail.
it's
going
to
be
delivered
at
such
and
such
a
time.
wasn't
the
magistrate
told
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
was
there
a
need
for
a
second
call
when
exactly
that
happened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't...
was...
he
was
on
the
premises?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
said,
i
know
why
they're
here.
