justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
a
warrant
like
a...
like
a
contract
has
a...
a
reasonable
life.
don't
you
think
a
warrant
expires
if
it
does
not
have
a
concluding
date?
you
think
it
goes
on
forever
and
ever
and
ever?
don't
you
think
a
warrant
just
lasts
a
reasonable
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
even...
even
if
the
warrant
did
not
specifically
say
that
it
was
an
anticipatory
warrant
and
that...
and
that
you
can
only
execute
it
after
the
delivery?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
that's
supposed
to
be
a...
a
magistrate's
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
could...
could
i
ask
you
if
the
government
would...
would
defend
a...
an
anticipatory
warrant
in
these
circumstances?
the
postal
inspectors
know
that
the
unlawful
video
has
been
put
in
the
mail
and
they
know
that
it...
it
is
going
to
one
of
17
individuals.
they're
not
sure
which
one
of
the
17.
so
they
go
and
get
a
warrant
that
says,
you
know...
and...
and
it
will
be
obvious
in
my
hypothesis
that
the
delivery
of
the
video
has
occurred.
so
can
they
get
a
warrant
that
says
you
can
go
in...
it
lists
all
of
these
17
people.
and
it
says
you
can
go
into
their
premises
as
soon
as
you
see
delivery
of
the
video.
would...
would
you
support
that
kind
of
an
anticipatory
warrant?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then...
then...
well,
i'm
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
because
then
you
are
really
not
saying
that
there
has
to
be
probable
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
at
the
outset
there's
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
any
one
of
those
17...
unless
you
think
one
seventeenth
is
enough
for
probable
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
a
particular
location.
i'm
talking
about
we
know
it's
going
to
be
one
of
17...
or
make
it
50,
if
you
like.
we
don't
know
which
of
those.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
want
a
warrant
that
will
let
us
go
in
immediately
when
we
see
it
delivered.
would
you
support
that
warrant?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
it's
in
somebody's
home.
it's
into
a
home.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you
don't
want
us
to
decide
the
case
on
that
ground.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is
probable
that
this
package
will
be
delivered
to
this
individual.
that
probability
exists
at
the
time
that
the
warrant
is...
is
issued.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
probable
cause
you're
relying
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
probable
that
this
package
will
be
delivered
to
this
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
reichel,
it...
it
seems
to
me
it's
part
of
your
case
that
the
probable
cause
must
be
in
existence
at
the
moment
the
warrant
is
issued
and
that
the
magistrate
cannot
take
into
account
the
passage
of
time.
are
you--
suppose
that...
that
policemen
apply
for
a...
a
warrant
in
manhattan
which
is
to
be
served
in
brooklyn,
and
it's
going
to...
it's
going
to
take
half
an
hour
to
get
there.
everybody
knows
it's
going
to
take
half
an
hour.
and
the
probable
cause
that
they
come
up
with
is
they
know
that
this
mob
leader
is
going
to
be
in
this
apartment
between
6:30
and
6:45.
okay?
and
they
present
the
warrant
to
the
magistrate
at...
at
6
o'clock.
it
will
take
half
an
hour
to
get
to
brooklyn.
the
magistrate
knows
that
when
it's
served,
the
mob
leader
will
be
in
this
apartment.
can
that...
can
that
warrant
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and...
and
likewise,
it...
it
would
work
the
other
way.
if
the
magistrate
had
the
same
facts,
the...
the
mob
leader
is
going
to
be
there
between
6:30
and
6:45,
and
the
warrant
is
presented
to
him
at
6:30,
he
would
have
to
decline
it
because
he
knows
by
the
time
it's
served,
it's...
it's
going
to
be
gone.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
magistrate
is
always
looking
to
the
condition
when...
when
the
warrant
is
executed,
and
that's
all
that's
happening
here.
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
person
will
be
receiving
contraband.
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
it
because
he
sent
for
it
and
it
was
mailed
to
him.
it's
just
a
matter
of
waiting
till
it
gets
there.
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
will
receive
it.
and
all
you're
doing
is
predicting
in
the
future,
saying
the
probable
cause
doesn't
exist
now,
but
it
exists
when
the
warrant
will
be
executed.
i
don't
see...
i
don't
see
any
real
difference
between
that
and
the...
and
the
mob
leader
example
i
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
but
it's
probable.
at
the
time
that
he
issues
the
warrant,
it
is
probable
that
this
person
will
be
receiving
contraband
because
they
showed,
you
know,
this
guy
sent
for
it.
he
sent
for
the...
these
child
pornography
films
in...
in
a...
you
know,
a
postal
service
rouse,
and
we
mailed
it
to
him.
it's
probable
that
he's
going
to
be
receiving
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
take
you
through
my...
a
variation
of
my
earlier
hypothetical?
you
say
that
the
magistrate
can
issue
the
warrant
at
6
o'clock,
although
he
knows
that
there
really
won't
be
the
probable
cause
until
6:30.
you
say
that
would
be
valid.
he
could
issue
it
in
manhattan
knowing
that
it
wouldn't
be
served
in...
in
brooklyn
until
6:30.
what
if
the
magistrate
specified
that
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution?
it's
just
the
same
case,
but
he
writes
on
the
warrant,
this
warrant
is
not
to
be
served
until
6:30.
does
that
make
it
invalid?
whereas,
it
was
valid
before,
it's
not
valid
if
he...
if
he
says
i
am
anticipating
what
will
be
the
situation
when
the
warrant
is
executed.
he
says
it
explicitly,
it
can't
be
served
until
6:30.
does
that
make
it
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it
strike
you
as...
as
strange
that
it's
perfectly
okay
if
he
issues
it
at
6
o'clock,
knowing
that
it'll
be...
won't...
that
there
isn't
probable
cause
now,
but
there
will
be
at
6:30
when
it
will
be
served.
you
say
that's
perfectly
okay.
but
if
he
says
it
on
a
warrant,
not
to
be
served
until
6:30,
it
suddenly
becomes
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
so...
so
you
say
so
long
as
you
say
something
as
clear
as
6:30,
that's
okay.
it
cannot
be
served
until
6:30.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
conversation
is
not
occurring
right
now.
the
magistrate
has
to
say
in
the
future,
when
this
warrant
is
executed,
the
conversation
probably
will
be
occurring.
right?
and
so
also
here.
you
know,
the...
the
receipt
is
not
occurring
now,
but
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
evidence
before
me,
i
think
that
that
receipt
will
be
occurring.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
the
government
concede
this
point?
i
had
thought
the
government
conceded
that
this
warrant
would
not
have
been
validly
executed
if
they
went
in
before
the
triggering
event.
otherwise,
there's
no
purpose
in
putting
in
the
triggering
event.
maybe
we'll
have
to
get
the
government
to...
to
state
that
explicitly,
but
that...
that's
my
understanding,
that
they
acknowledge
this
warrant
would
not
have
been
validly
executed
if
they
went
in
before
the
triggering
event
occurred.
if
that's
not
the
case,
i
agree.
i
don't
know
why
we
took
the
case.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
who--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
who,
what,
and
where
includes
when,
but
it
doesn't
include
how.
right?
where...
where
do
you
derive
this
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
all...
this
whole
argument
begs
the
question.
it...
it
assumes
that
the
particularity
requirement
includes
time,
not
only
who,
what,
where,
but
also
when.
right?
i
mean,
you...
you
acknowledge
that
if
you're
wrong
about
that,
if
you're
wrong
about
the
fact
that
who,
what,
and
where
automatically
includes
when,
the
argument
you've
just
made
doesn't
get
anywhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that's
your
argument,
but
you
agree
that
if...
if
that
argument
is
wrong,
you're
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
they...
and
they
found
other...
other
videotapes
besides
the
one
that
had
just
been
delivered,
didn't
they,
in
the
course
of
the
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
a
quick
yes
or
no.
does
the
government
concede
that
when
you
have
an
anticipatory
warrant,
the
warrant
is
not
properly
executed
until
the...
the
anticipated
event
occurs?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
9th
circuit.
the
respondent
jeffrey
grubbs
purchased
a
video
tape
containing
child
pornography
from
a
website
operated
by
an
undercover
postal
inspector.
officers
from
the
postal
inspection
service
then
arranged
a
controlled
delivery
of
the
video
tape
to
grubb’s
residence.
they
submitted
a
search
warrant
application
to
a
magistrate
judge
for
the
eastern
district
of
california,
accompanied
by
a
affidavit
explaining
that
the
warrant
would
not
be
executed
unless
and
until
the
controlled
delivery
was
successful.
in
addition
to
describing
this
triggering
condition
for
the
warrant,
the
affidavit
referred
to
two
attachments
that
described
the
residence
to
be
searched
and
the
items
to
be
seized.
these
attachments,
but
not
the
body
of
the
affidavit,
were
incorporated
into
the
warrant.
the
magistrate
judge
issued
the
warrant
as
requested.
after
the
package
was
delivered,
the
officers
conducted
a
search
of
grubbs’s
residence.
they
provided
him
with
a
copy
of
the
warrant
which
included
both
attachments,
but
not
the
supporting
affidavit
that
explained
when
the
warrant
would
be
executed.
grubbs
was
arrested
after
he
admitted
ordering
the
video
tape,
and
police
seized
the
video
tape
and
the
other
items.
a
grand
jury
for
the
eastern
district
of
california
indicted
grubbs
for
receiving
child
pornography.
he
unsuccessfully
sought
to
suppress
the
seized
evidence,
arguing
as
relevant
here,
that
the
warrant
was
invalid
because
it
failed
to
set
forth
the
triggering
condition.
grubbs
pleaded
guilty
but
reserved
his
right
to
appeal
the
denial
of
his
motion
to
suppress.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
invalidating
the
warrant
on
the
ground
that,
“the
particularity
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
applies
with
full
force
to
the
conditions
precedent
to
an
anticipatory
search
warrant”.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
9th
circuit.
we
agree
with
the
9th
circuit
and
all
other
circuits
that
have
considered
this
issue
that
anticipatory
warrants
are
not
categorically
unconstitutional.
unlike
the
9th
circuit
however,
we
conclude
that
the
particularity
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
that
an
anticipatory
warrant
set
forth
the
conditions
precedent
to
its
execution.
an
anticipatory
warrant
is
a
warrant
based
upon
an
affidavit
showing
probable
cause
that
at
some
future
time
but
not
presently,
certain
evidence
of
the
crime
will
be
located
at
a
specified
place.
most
anticipatory
warrants
subject
their
execution
to
some
condition
precedent
other
than
the
mere
passage
of
time,
or
so
called
‘triggering’
condition,
in
this
case
for
example,
the
execution
of
the
warrant
was
conditioned
on
successful
delivery
of
the
parcel
containing
the
pornography.
grubbs
argues
that
such
warrants
contravene
the
fourth
amendment’s
provision
that,
“no
warrants
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause”.
our
cases
make
clear
however,
that
probable
cause
exists
when
“there
is
a
fair
probability
that
contraband
or
evidence
of
a
crime
will
be
found,
not
now
exists,
but
will
be
found
in
a
particular
place”.
because
the
probable
cause
requirement
looks
to
whether
evidence
will
be
found
when
the
search
is
concluded,
all
warrants
are,
in
some
sense
anticipatory.
so
called
anticipatory
warrants
are
no
different
in
principle
from
other
warrants;
they
require
the
magistrate
to
determine
that
it
is
now
probable
that
contraband,
evidence
of
a
crime,
or
a
fugitive
will
be
on
the
described
premises
when
the
warrant
is
executed.
when
however,
the
anticipatory
warrant
places
a
condition
on
its
execution
other
than
the
mere
passage
of
time,
the
probability
that
a
proper
object
of
seizure
will
be
on
the
described
premises
also
depends
on
the
likelihood
that
the
condition
will
occur;
that
is,
it
must
not
only
be
probable
that
if
the
triggering
condition
occurs,
contraband
evidence
of
a
crime
or
a
fugitive
will
be
found
at
the
location
of
the
search,
but
it
must
also
be
probable
that
the
triggering
condition
will
occur.
in
this
case,
the
occurrence
of
the
triggering
condition,
successful
delivery
of
the
video
tape,
would
plainly
establish
probable
cause
for
the
search,
and
the
affidavit
established
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
triggering
condition
would
indeed
be
satisfied.
on
the
9th
circuit’s
view,
the
warrant
at
issue
here,
in
addition
to
violating
the
probable
cause
requirement,
the
warrant
violated
the
fourth
amendment’s
particularity
requirement
because
it
failed
to
specify
the
triggering
condition.
this
holding
is
impossible
to
square
with
the
text
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
lists
only
two
matters
that
must
be
particularly
described
in
the
warrant,
namely,
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized;
that
language
is
precise,
clear,
and
decisive.
the
particularity
requirement
does
not
include
the
conditions
precedent
to
execution
of
the
warrant,
and
the
9th
circuit
therefore
erred
in
invalidating
the
warrant.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment,
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
