i
think,
mr.
dreeben,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
i
agree
with
you
on
the
particularity
argument,
but
do
you
take
the...
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
the...
that
the...
that
a
valid
warrant
need
not
contain
an
indication
of
the
time
within
which
it
may
be
served,
executed?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
far
as--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but...
but,
mr.
dreeben,
there's
an
ongoing
obligation
of
reasonableness
in
the
manner
of
which
the...
in...
in
the
manner
in
which
the
search
is
carried
out.
but
unless
every
officer
who...
who
acts
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant
is
aware
of
the
probable
cause
evidence
and
can
make
a
judgment
when
that
evidence
either
is
stale
or,
in
this
case,
has
not
yet
ripened,
then
in
fact
there
is
no
way
for
an
officer
to
make
that
kind
of
what
you're
calling
the
reasonableness
judgment
in
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
he
simply
doesn't
have
the
factual
background
for
it,
and
that's
where
the
timing...
we'll
call
it...
the
timing
clause
comes
in
because
at
least
an
officer
who
may
not
know
the
probable
cause
behind
it
all...
at
least
an
officer
who
has
a
warrant
that
says,
you
may
search
between
times
x
and
y,
or
a
warrant
that
says,
upon
the
occurrence
of
event
x
and
time
y,
has
a...
a
rough
and
sound
idea
of
when
he
can
act.
but
if
that's
not
in
the
warrant,
the
officer
cannot
make
that
judgment.
he
doesn't
know
the
probable
cause
necessarily
and
he
doesn't
know
the
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
it...
it
was...
i
take
it
it
was,
in
fact,
not
attached
but
it
was
somewhere
on
the
premises.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
an
officer
who
picked
up
the
warrant
would
not
be
able
to
tell
necessarily.
if
he
said,
hey,
has
somebody
got
the
affidavit,
they
could
have
brought
it
forward
and
he
could
have
found
out.
but
if...
if
somebody
didn't
know
where
the
affidavit
was,
he
wouldn't
have
any
way
of
knowing.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
doesn't
that
simply...
isn't
the
analogy
there
that
when
a...
when
a
search
warrant
says
you
may...
you
may
pick
up
implements
of
drug
traffic,
all
it
covers
is
drug
traffic.
it
doesn't
cover
coffee,
tea,
and...
and
milk.
in...
in
the
case
of
the
electronic
surveillance,
they're
supposed
to
record
criminal
conversations
and...
but
not
others.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
those...
those
are
judgments
about
facts
that
they
are
finding.
they
are
not
judgments
about
probable
cause
or
the
moment
at
which
the
warrant
becomes
valid.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is.
the...
the
moment...
the
triggering
event
is
the
event
that
determines
that
the
probable
cause
determination
is,
in
fact,
true
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
his
judgment,
though,
is
there
will
be
probable
cause
when
the
triggering
event
occurs.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
the
triggering--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
triggering
event
has
a
probable
cause
implication,
which
the
selection
of
objects
to
be
seized
does
not
have.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he's
saying
two
things.
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
what
we're
calling
the
triggering
event
will
occur,
and
there
is
probable...
and
when
that
triggering
event
occurs,
there
will
be
probable
cause
to
believe
that
evidence
of
a
crime
may
be
found
and
seized
at
such
and
such
a
place.
there
are
two
determinations.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
exactly
the
same
thing
would
be
true
if
they
had
stated
the
triggering
event
clearly
somewhere
in...
in
the
warrant.
the...
the
argument
here
is
that
the
triggering
event
was
stated
in
the
affidavit.
