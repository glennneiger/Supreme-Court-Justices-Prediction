day
o'connor
mr.
reichel,
did
you
take
the
position
in
the
proceedings
below
that
anticipatory
warrants
are
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
and
did
you
raise
the
issue
in
your
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
but
you
want
us
to
address
it
now.
i
mean,
you...
you
make
a
big
deal
of
the
notion
that
there's
no
such
thing
as
an
anticipatory
warrant.
and
yet,
it's
never
been
addressed
below.
it
wasn't
addressed
by
the
court
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
give
you
another
example.
there
are
search
warrants
for
wiretaps,
are
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
are
often
anticipatory.
they
aren't
issued
because
the
suspect
is
now
using
the
phone,
but
because
it's
anticipated
in
the
future
the
suspect
will
use
the
phone
at
some
point
and
there's
probable
cause
to
believe,
if...
if
the
suspect
does,
there
may
be
evidence
of
a
crime.
i
mean,
anticipatory
warrants
are
just
inherent
in
the
system.
i
don't...
i
just
don't
think
your
argument
follows
from
precedent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
constitution
still
applies
to
it,
and
they
are
inherently
anticipatory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
probable
cause
that
there...
this
is
somebody
who's
going
to
use
a
certain
telephone
number
and
that
there
may
be
reason
to
suspect
a
crime
will
be
discussed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
this
is
no
different
than
that.
