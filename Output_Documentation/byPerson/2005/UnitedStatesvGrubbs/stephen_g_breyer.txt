justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
i...
i
have
a
question
that
you
could
just
clarify
a
confusion.
you
want
to
bring
into
this
case
the
question
of
whether
or
not
anticipatory
warrants
are
ever
valid.
i
had
a
case
in
the
first
circuit
where
i
explained
my
view
on
that.
i
thought
they
would
be
reasonably
described.
so
i
don't
know
if
that
issue
should
be
brought
up
here.
maybe.
i
can't
figure
out
what
issue
should
be
brought
up
here.
there's
a
van
treska
case
that
says
we
ought
to
read
these
things
in
a
common
sense
fashion.
all
right?
i
read
it.
my
common
sense
says
i
have
a
warrant
here.
it
says
nothing
about
anticipatory
anything.
it
says
you
can
go
and
search
for
any
of
16
items,
14
of
which
are
in
his
house
well
before
the
delivery.
after
all,
he's
had
all
this
correspondence
with
these
people
about
child
pornography.
they
have
terrific
reason
for
thinking
he
might
have
some.
and
that's
all
it
says.
and
then
it
says,
is
there
probable
cause
for
a
warrant
that
says
go
in
any
time
now
and
search
for
any
of
these
items,
including
what
will
be
delivered,
if
that's
when
you
do
it?
i
say
i
look
at
the
probable
cause.
his
probable
cause
is
he
thinks
that
another
package
is
being
delivered,
and
he's
right
to
think
it.
now,
whether
it
is
delivered
or
not
doesn't
add
anything
really
to
the
issuance
of
the
warrant.
it
might
add
to
his
personal
confidence.
but
that's
my
common
sense
opinion.
the
common
sense
is
the
only
question
here
is
do
they
have
probable
cause
to
issue
a
warrant
that
allows
them
to
search
now,
because
that's
what
it
says.
so
now
how...
how,
given
that...
i
grant
you
the
ninth
circuit
went
into
all
kinds
of
other
things,
but
you
explain
to
me,
please,
how
i'm
supposed
to
reach
those
other
things
and
what
i'm
supposed
to
do,
and
why
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
it's
not
supported.
it's
specific.
it
says
go
to
jeffrey
grubbs'
residence
and
then
it
has
an
attachment
a
which
describes
it
with
great
specificity.
and
go
and
search
for
and
seize
the
records
and
materials
described
in
attachment
b,
and
then
we
have
16
different
kinds
of
items
with
great
specificity.
that's
it.
that's
the
end
of
this
warrant,
and
that's
what
it
says
to
do,
and
that's
what
he
did.
and
then
he
has
a
different
affidavit
which
gives
him
the
probable
cause
for
issuing
the
warrant
i
just
described.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
reading
the
warrant.
i'm
not
reading
the
affidavit.
it
happens
to
say
that
the
affidavit
is...
that
that
affidavit
is...
it's
in
appendix
a,
appendix
b,
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
going
in
on...
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says...
mine
says,
you
may
command
to
search
on
or
before
april
27th
for
10
days
the
person/place
named
and
make
the
search
in
the
daytime
between
6:00
and
10:00.
that's
what
mine
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
there's
an
affidavit
about
probable
cause.
that's
true.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what's
not
stated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
there
a
limit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it
that
tells
us
that?
i
just
happened
to
read
an
affidavit
where
the...
the
person
says
that
he
won't
enter
until
this
package
is
there,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
cause
i
would
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well...
well,
he
says
in
his
affidavit
he's
not
going
to
execute
it
until
this
package
is
delivered,
but
that...
if
i
read
it
in
a
common
sense
way,
say,
of
course,
he
isn't
going
to
because
he
wants
to
get
everything
at
once.
but
after
all,
he's
in
the
place.
i
would
say
there's
a
lot
of
probable
cause
for
him
to
looking
for
12
of
these
items
which
are
there
whether
this
package
is
there
or
not.
of
course,
he's
not
going
to
execute
it
till
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
that's
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
will
you...
will
you
just
help
me
with
this?
justice
stevens
answered
my
question.
the
word
anticipatory.
the
word
anticipatory
does
suggest
it
isn't
valid
for
a
while.
nothing
else
in
the
warrant
does.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
if
i
think
there's
adequate
probable
cause
for
issuing
that
warrant
right
now
in
respect
to
12
of
the
things?
and
it's
really
pretty
hard
for
me
to
try
to
understand
what
this
warrant
is
about
if
i'm
supposed
to
understand
it,
by
reading
through
about
15
or
20
pages
of
small
print
and
there
discovering
somewhere
in
the
back
of
it
some...
the
post
office
says
i'm
not
going
to
execute
this
until
this
other
package
gets
there
too.
now,
that
does
make
me
nervous.
that...
that
supports
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that,
but
it's
not
going
to
support
you
enough
unless
you
connect
this
anxiety
i'm
having
now
about
this
being
buried
in
page
28
of
an
affidavit
when
it's
an
important
condition
of
the
warrant,
the
only
clue
to
that
fact
being
the
word
anticipatory.
and
there
we
are.
now,
you
tell
me
why
this
anxiety,
which
is
going
to
help
you,
is
connected
to
something
in
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
please
don't.
i
start
with
an
assumption
that
an
anticipatory
warrant
is
constitutionally
valid.
i
start
with
that
assumption.
i'm
assuming
that
the
conditions
have
to
reasonably
describe.
my
anxiety
is
resting
only
on
the
fact
that
this
warrant
doesn't
seem
to
be
an
anticipatory
warrant
but
for
one
word,
and
to
know
what
it's
about,
you
have
to
look
through
28
pages
of
fine
print.
now,
you
connect
that
anxiety
to
something
in
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
just
want
us
to
say,
look,
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong.
they're
okay
to
have
conditional
warrants
like
this
and
there
is
no
absolute
rule
you
always
have
to
have
the
triggering
condition
in.
as
to
whether
this
is
too
confusing
or
not
too
confusing,
send
them
back
and
let
them
figure
it
out.
