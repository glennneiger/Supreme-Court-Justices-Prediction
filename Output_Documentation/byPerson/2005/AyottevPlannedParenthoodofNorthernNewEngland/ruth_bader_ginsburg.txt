but,
your
opinion...
that's
the
real
problem
here
for
the
doctor
who
is
on
the
line.
and
you
said
the
lawyer
would
say,
oh,
you've
got
this
defense
of...
what
do
you
call
it
harm--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--competing
harms,
a
defense...
i
think
that
a
lawyer
who
cares
about
his
client
would
say,
defense
is
not
what
we
want.
what
we
want
is
there
is
no
claim,
not
that
you
have
to
put
up
a
defense
and
maybe
the
attorney
general
will
give
us
a
letter
saying
that
we
come
under
that
defense.
wouldn't
a
careful
lawyer
say,
what
you
need
to
be
protected
is
that
there
is
no
claim
for
doing
what
you're
doing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
it
be
as
applied?
look
at
your
reply
brief
at
page
3.
and
you've
made
it
very
clear,
and
i
think
that
it
is
helpful
that
you
did,
that
there
could
be
this
preenforcement
action
by
doctors
who
would
not
have
to
wait
until
faced
with
an
actual
medical
emergency
to
bring
the
suit.
you've
talking
about
this
small
category
of
cases,
but
i
take
it
from
what
you
have
read...
what
the
lines
i've
just
read,
that
you
envision
a
doctor
who
says,
sooner
or
later,
i'm
going
to
have
such
a
case.
right
now,
i
don't
know
and
i
can't
know
until
it's
too
late
to
come
to
any
court,
so
i'm
going
to
bring
this
preenforcement
which
you
characterized
as
applied.
but
i
don't
see
how
its
as
applied,
if
if
the
physician
just
says,
as
you
put
it,
i
don't
have
to
wait
until
faced
with
an
actual
medical
emergency
to
bring
this
suit.
so
what
is
the
relief,
what
is
the
lawsuit
that
you
envision
would
be
proper?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
do
that
as
a
class
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
circumstance?
all
you
said
here
is
there
coule
be
a
preenforcement
challenge
by
doctors
who
would
not
have
to
wait
until
faced
with
an
actual
medical
emergency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
exactly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
i
think
what
you're
saying
essentially
is
that
the
first
circuit
was
concerned
with
this
category,
wanted
to
give
preenforcement
relief
to
the
physician,
so
what
they
did
was
write
except
that
they
should
have
said
this
statute
is
not
enforceable
where
there
is
a
risk
to
the
woman's
health
and
it
cannot
be
applied
in
any
such
cases.
where
there
is
a
risk
to
the
health,
then
the
statute
is
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
used
this
word
severance
now
twice.
severance
is
i
excised
a
clause
from
the
statute,
but
you're
not
asking
for
that.
it's
not
severance.
there
is
no
provision
to
be
severed
here.
it's
putting
a
caret
mark
and
adding
something
to
it.
not
taking
out
any
provision,
but
putting
in
an
additional
provision.
