justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
just
imagine
a
real
circumstance.
a
15
year
old
walks
in
2:00
in
the
morning
on
saturday
into
the
emergency
room
and
the
doctor
looks
at
her,
she's
pregnant,
she
has
this
very
high
blood
pressure,
whatever.
and
the
doctor
thinks
to
himself,
he
thinks,
well,
immediate
abortion,
no
question,
immediately
deliver
the
child.
if
i
don't,
i
don't
think
she's
going
to
die
but
she'll
never
have
children.
and
he's
thinking
that.
what's
supposed
to
happen?
he
calls
up
pam
pevagoglio
or
pam
livingston
and
there
is
no
answer.
it's
2:00
in
the
morning
and
there
is
one
of
those
things,
leave
a
message,
okay?
should
i
call
your
parents?
no.
they
don't
know
i'm
pregnant.
now,
what's
supposed
to
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
that
in
the
statute.
it
suggests
the
contrary.
so
what
is
the
particular
provision
of
new
hampshire
law
that
tells
that...
i
mean,
the
doctor...
all
these
things
are,
you
know,
questions
of
probability.
and
he
doesn't
want
to
risk
being
prosecuted
and
he
doesn't
want
to
risk
losing
his
license.
and
so
what
particular
provision...
he
happens
to
have
his
lawyer
with
him.
[laughter]
what
does
the
lawyer
say?
okay?
what's
the
provision
that
saves
him?
there
is
no
health
exemption
in
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
know?
i
mean,
what
you're
saying
is
fine,
but
how
do
we
know
that
that's
actually
the
law?
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
absolutely
in
very
good
faith
would
say
that
it
isn't
competing
harm.
they
would
say
that
the
competing
right
that
the
life
of
the
fetus
is
more
important
than
the
possibility
of
the
mother
having
children
in
the
future
herself.
see,
there
are
people
in
good
faith
on
both
sides
of
this
argument.
and
so
how
do
we
know
that
the
new
hampshire
statute
is
going
to
do...
not
the
statute,
but
your
competing
harms
defense
is
going
to
do
for
this
particular
woman
what
a
health
exception
would
do?
