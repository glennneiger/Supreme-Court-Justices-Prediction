general
ayotte.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
am
i
right
in
reading
your
briefs
that
you
don't
object
to
a
preenforcement
challenge
to
the
bypass
procedure
itself
brought
by
physicians,
for
example?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
gather
that
the
debate
on
the
evidence
and
the
circumstances
that
might
arise
in
that
case
would
be
quite
similar
to
the
debate
in
the
present
context.
in
other
words,
there
would
be
the
same
discussion
between
the
different
physicians
about
what
emergencies
arise
and
in
what
circumstances
and
whether
that
creates
a
problem
and
whether
you
can
get
to
the
courts
in
time
and
so
on.
it
would
be
the
same
underlying
sort
of
evidence
that
we
have
here,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
be
a
finding
that
the
bypass
procedure
is
inadequate
which
doesn't
necessarily
implicate
the
general
notification
provisions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
general
clement,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
