justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
first
answer
to
justice
souter
was
that
the
physician
would
say
you
can't
be
prosecuted
under
our
law.
do
you
mean
this
act
that
we're
looking
at
here?
or
do
you
mean
the
law
generally
including
constitutional
protections
that
this
court
has
proclaimed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
of
the
text
of
the
act
or
because
of
some
policy
that
the
attorney
general
would
follow
in
order
just
to
decline
to
prosecute?
we
want
to
know
what
this
act
says
in
the
instance
posed
by
justice
souter.
