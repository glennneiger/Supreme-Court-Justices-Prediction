ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
court
of
appeals
struck
down
new
hampshire's
parental
notification
act
on
its
face
based
upon
a
potential
application
of
the
act
that
even
respondents
concede
may
only
arise
in
the
smallest
fraction
of
cases.
in
doing
so,
the
act
was
rendered
ineffective
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
applications
where
it
is
unquestionably
constitutional,
and
state
officials
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
imply...
apply
and
enforce
new
hampshire's
act
within
constitutional
limits.
new
hampshire's
act
can
be
applied
in
a
manner
to
protect
a
minor's
health
if
the
rare
case
arises
where
a
medical
emergency
occurs
that
requires
an
immediate
abortion.
in
that
rare
case,
if
it
does
arise,
where
an
abortion
has
to
be
performed
immediately
and
the
child
does
not
want
to
notify
a
parent,
there
is
a
judicial
bypass
mechanism
available
which
requires
new
hampshire
courts
to
act
promptly
and
without
delay
and
in
the
best
interests
of
the
minor.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
souter,
in
that
instance,
we
did
not
say
that
it
was
an
independent
constitutional
requirement
that
there
be
a
health
exception,
but
certainly
reading
this
court's
cases,
we
should
apply
our
act
in
a
manner
to
protect
if
that
rare
case
arises
where
an
emergency
abortion
would
come
forward.
and,
if
a
physician
were
prosecuted
under
those
circumstances,
we
believe
not
only
would
he
have
a
statutory
ability
to
say
this
prosecution
is
inappropriate
given
our
law,
but
also
given
those
rare
circumstances,
we
do
not
think
that
he,
under
the
constitution,
may
be
prosecuted.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
i
may
not
because
new
hampshire's
act
may
not
be
applied
in
a
manner
to
ensure
that
if
a
minor
in
that
rare
circumstance
needs
an
immediate
abortion,
that
she
receives
that
immediate
medical
care
in
those
circumstances.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
souter,
not
that
there
is
an
express
requirement
of
a
health
exception
but
that
the
law
cannot
be
implied
in
a
manner
to
infringe
on
the
minor's
health
if
that
rare
emergency
case
arises.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
kennedy,
in
that
limited
circumstance,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
physician
would
be
prosecuted
under
our
parental
notification
act,
given
that
there
is
a
mechanism--
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
--justice
kennedy,
with
respect
to
the
act
itself,
assuming
it
were
a
life...
excuse
me,
a
health
emergency
short
of
a
life
threatening
emergency,
where
a
minor
did
not
want
to
notify
her
parents
and
assuming
those
situations
came
forward
and
someone
was
unable
to
reach
a
judge,
the
act
itself
provides
a
mechanism
in
it
that
anticipates
providing
a
judge
where
necessary,
and
so
that
would
be
the
ability
of
a
minor
in
those
circumstances
to
seek
a
judge.
but
if
for
some
reason
all
of
those
situations
came
together
and
the
minor
could
not
seek
a
judicial
bypass
in
those
instances,
there
is
an
existing
provision
of
new
hampshire
law,
our
competing
harms
defense,
that
we
believe
protects
the
physician
in
those
circumstances.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
breyer,
the
physician
in
those
instances
could
perform
the
immediate
abortion.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
your
honor,
his
lawyer
would
advise
him,
in
those
circumstances,
that
the
competing
harms
defense
would
protect
his
actions
because
he
needs
to
act
urgently
necessary...
in
an
urgently
necessary
circumstance.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
o'connor,
by
the
plain
language
of
the
competing
harms
defense,
it
also
precludes
civil
liability.
i
would
also
say
that
that
lawyer
would
also
advise
him,
if
given
the
opportunity,
the
attorney
general
is
prepared
also
to
issue
an
opinion
describing
the
applicability
of
the
competing
harms
defense
in
this
very
rare
circumstance,
should
it
arise.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
breyer,
because
the
harm
that
is
being
weighed
here
is
the
harm
of
urgently
providing
care
to
this
minor
who
needs
it,
as
opposed
to
the
harm
that
the
act
is
trying
to
get
at,
which
is
notification
of
parents.
it's
not
whether
or
not
the
minor
can
have
an
abortion.
the
minor
can
always
go
forward
and
have
an
abortion
under
these
circumstances.
so
people
aren't
weighing
the
right
of
the
fetus,
in
this
instance,
to
the
right
of
the
mother's
health.
so
the
weighing
is
quite
easy.
and
if
given
the
opportunity,
my
office
would
be
prepared
to
issue
an
opinion
as
to
the
applicability
of
this
defense.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
simopoulos
case
considered
by
this
court,
one
of
the
issues
that
was
raised
was
a
medical...
the
physician
was
prosecuted
for
performing
an
abortion
outside
the
parameters
of
the
virginia
act.
and
the
physician
failed
to
raise
a
medical
necessity
defense.
this
court
held
that
that
was
sufficient
prosecution,
that
that
was
okay.
and
this
would
work
the
same
way.
once
the
physician
raises
a
competing
harms
defense--
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
--justice
stevens,
the
legislative
history...
there
certainly
was
some
indication
that
the
legislature
did
not
want
a
general
health
exception.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
legislature
intended
to
preclude
this
narrow
category
of
cases
which
constitute
emergency
cases
short
of
that.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
your
honor,
when
they
discussed
the
history
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
senate,
they
felt
that
it
protected
for
emergencies
and
there
was
no
discussion
of
this
narrow
category
of
cases
short
of
death.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
scalia,
no.
in
fact,
the
analysis,
if
you
look
at
this
one
potential
application,
this...
the
standard
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
goes
well
beyond
even
a
substantial
overbreadth
test
that
is
applied
by
this
court
in
the
first
amendment
context.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
mr.
chief
justice,
no,
we
do
not
object
in
that
sense.
we
think
that
is
a
very
good
mechanism
to
bring
forth
a
case
given
that
this
court
has
granted
third
party
standing
to
physicians
to
resolve
these
types
of
claims.
and
the
benefit--
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
--mr.
chief
justice,
it
would,
but
it
would
be
much
more
narrowly
focused
in
terms
of
bringing
it
as
an
as
applied
challenge,
this
was
brought--
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
--justice
ginsburg,
the
lawsuit
would
be
a
preenforcement
as
applied
challenge
and
the
physician
would
bring
the
claim
and
would
say,
as
applied
to
me,
i
perform
abortions,
i
also
perform
abortions
on
minors.
i
need
to
perform
an
abortion
in
these
emergency
settings.
the
court
can
issue
an
order,
presuming
it's
not
satisfied
with
the
protections
that
are
set
forth
in
new
hampshire
law
that
i've
described.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
depending
on
the
circumstance,
he
may
be
able
to.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
stevens,
this
is
not
this
case
because
this
case
was
brought
as
a
facial
challenge.
our
entire
act
was
struck
down
based
upon
that
one
potential--
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
--no,
he
doesn't.
he
can
bring
it
before
the
patient
is
in
his
office
and
then
the
court
could
issue
relief
which
would
be
much
more
consistent
with
the
principles
of
certainly
separation
of
powers
and
allowing
the
overwhelming
number
of
our
applications
of
our
statutes
that
are
valid
to
go
forward.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
that's
quite
a
different
lawsuit
and
a
lawsuit
that
would
be
certainly,
from
the
state's
perspective,
would
allow
the
overwhelming
number
of
applications
of
this
statute
where
there
is
no
dispute
that
it
works
well,
to
go
forward.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
stevens,
it
would
be
only
in
the
context
of
that
one
particular
application
as
applied
to
that
physician,
which
would
have
stare
decisis--
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
--mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
be
the
case.
and
certainly
if
that
one
application,
in
that
one
potential
rare
case
was
found
not
to
be
valid,
then
the
remainder
of
the
applications
can
go
forward.
and
that
is
how
most
cases
work
with
respect
to
as
applied
relief.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice
ginsburg,
the
first
circuit
went
well
beyond
because
it
focused
on
a
general
health
exception,
they've
now
focusing
it
on
an
emergency
exception.
but
certainly
the
relief
should
have
been
as
applied.
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
justice--
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
--justice
o'connor,
we
did
raise
the
application
of
the
severance
clause
below,
although
the
court,
both
at
the
district
court
level
and
the
first
circuit
appeared
to
look
at
the...
the
lack
of
a
general
health
exception
as
a
per
se
constitutional
problem
that
rendered
the
statute
as
a
whole
invalid.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
your
honor,
we
certainly
raised
the
severance
issue
in
the
district
court.
ms.
kelly
a.
ayotte
your
honor,
you're
correct.
what
our
position
is
is
that
they
did
not
meet
the
standard
that
they
should
have
been
able
to
meet
for
a
facial
challenge,
which
would
grant
as
applied
relief
which
would
only
be
invalid
in
that
one
potential
application.
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
with
all
due
respect.
