justice
john
paul
stevens
general,
may
i
just
point
this...
suppose
the
lawyer
or
the
doctor
are
aware
of
the
legislative
history
and
say,
well,
generally
that's
true.
but
when
you
have
a
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
the
legislature
considered
this
very
defense
and
rejected
it
in
the
statute,
would
then
that
then
give
them
some
concern?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
discussed
the
issue
on
the
floor
of
the
legislature,
why
wouldn't
they
have
drafted
the
precise
protection
they
thought
appropriate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
that
this
case?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
he
has
to
bring
the
as
applied
challenge
when
he
has
the
patient
in
his
office?
he
has
to
wait
until
he
has
the
patient
in
the
office,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
justice
scalia's
case,
would
not
the
reason
for
that
relief
have
to
be
a
finding
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
you
can't
just
grant
the
relief
because
you
think
it's
a
good
idea.
