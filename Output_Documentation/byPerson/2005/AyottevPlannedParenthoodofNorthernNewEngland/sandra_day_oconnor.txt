this
case
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
1st
circuit.
it
involves
new
hampshire’s
parental
notification
prior
to
abortion
act,
which
prohibits
physicians
from
performing
an
abortion
on
a
pregnant
minor
until
48
hours
after
written
notice
of
the
pending
abortion
is
delivered
to
her
parent
or
guardian.
the
act
does
not
permit
physicians
to
perform
immediate
abortions
in
medical
emergencies,
despite
any
risk
to
the
minor
that
would
result
from
delay
in
complying
with
the
act’s
requirements.
respondents
are
an
obstetrician-gynecologist
who
has
a
private
practice
in
manchester
and
three
clinics
that
offer
reproductive-health
services.
all
provide
abortions
for
pregnant
minors,
and
each
anticipates
having
to
provide
emergency
abortions
for
some
number
of
minors
in
the
future.
before
the
act
took
effect,
they
brought
suit,
alleging
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
because,
among
other
reasons,
it
would
prevent
them
from
providing
immediate
abortions
in
medical
emergencies.
the
district
court
agreed
the
act
is
unconstitutional,
because
it
lacks
a
health
exception
and
permanently
enjoined
its
enforcement.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
three
propositions
are
established:
first,
under
our
precedents,
states
unquestionably
have
the
right
to
require
parental
involvement
when
a
minor
considers
terminating
her
pregnancy;
second,
also
under
our
precedents,
states
may
not
restrict
access
to
abortions
that
are
necessary
in
appropriate
medical
judgment
for
preservation
of
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother;
third,
new
hampshire
has
not
taken
real
issue
with
the
factual
basis
for
this
litigation,
which
is
this:
in
some
small
percentage
of
pregnancies,
minors,
like
adult
women,
may
need
immediate
abortions
to
avert
serious
and
often
irreversible
damage
to
their
health.
new
hampshire
has
maintained
that
various
parts
of
its
laws,
including
the
act’s
own
provision
for
judicial
permission
to
forego
notification,
should
protect
both
physician
and
patient
in
most,
if
not
all,
cases
in
which
immediate
abortion
is
necessary.
but
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
found
that
new
hampshire
law
does
not
protect
minors’
health
reliably
in
all
emergencies,
and
new
hampshire
has
conceded
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
apply
the
act
in
a
manner
that
subjects
minors
to
significant
health
risks.
we
therefore
address
here
a
question
of
remedy.
when
a
statute
restricting
access
to
abortion
may
be
applied
in
a
manner
that
harms
women’s
health,
what
is
the
appropriate
judicial
response?
generally
speaking,
when
confronting
a
constitutional
flaw
in
a
statute,
we
try
to
limit
the
solution
to
the
problem.
we
prefer,
for
example,
to
enjoin
only
the
unconstitutional
applications
of
a
statute,
while
leaving
other
applications
in
force
or
to
sever
its
problematic
portions
while
leaving
the
remainder
intact.
three
interrelated
principles
inform
our
approach
to
remedies:
first,
we
try
not
to
nullify
more
of
a
legislature’s
work
than
is
necessary;
second,
mindful
that
our
constitutional
mandate
and
institutional
competence
are
limited,
we
restrain
ourselves
from
rewriting
state
law,
even
as
we
strive
to
salvage
it;
finally,
the
touchstone
for
any
decision
about
remedy
is
legislative
intent.
thus,
after
finding
an
application
or
portion
of
a
statute
unconstitutional,
courts
must
next
ask:
would
the
legislature
prefer
what
is
left
of
its
statute
to
no
statute
at
all?
in
this
case,
the
courts
below
chose
the
most
blunt
remedy,
permanently
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
new
hampshire’s
parental
notification
law
and
thereby
invalidating
it
entirely;
but
reflecting
on
our
general
approach
to
remedies,
we
think
the
act
need
not
necessarily
have
been
invalidated
wholesale.
only
a
very
few
applications
of
the
act
should
present
a
constitutional
problem,
if
any.
so
long
as
they
are
faithful
to
legislative
intent,
then,
the
lower
courts
can
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
prohibiting
the
act’s
unconstitutional
application.
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
whether
new
hampshire’s
legislature
intended
the
statute
to
be
susceptible
to
such
a
remedy.
we
remand
for
the
lower
courts
to
determine
legislative
intent
in
the
first
instance.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
