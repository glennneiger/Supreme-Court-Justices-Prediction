justice

scalia
and
you
have
another
point
here,
don't
you,
about
how
general
this
statute
is.
we
don't
normally
interpret
statutes
this
way,
that
they
are
totally
invalid
if
any
application
of
them
would
be
unconstitutional.
that's
not
what
we
do
with
statutes
normally,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
about
a
lawsuit
which
asks
for
declaration,
not
that
the
entire
statute
is
invalid.
but
that,
when
faced
with
an
emergency
of
the
sort
that
this
discussion
has
addressed,
the
physician
can
go
ahead
and
perform
the
abortion?
justice
antonin
scalia
quite
a
different
lawsuit
from
this
one.
