justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you
at
this
point?
because
there
is
one
thing
that
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
about
your
position,
and
one
way
of
reading
your
brief
takes
you
a
step
beyond
what
you
have
just
said.
so
i
would
like
to
get
clear
on
this.
and
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
given
the
safeguards
such
as
judicial
override,
there
simply
was
no...
there
was
no
need
to
read
the
health
exception
in,
that
in
fact
it
was
taken
care
of...
any
of
the
issues
that
might
be
raised
in
arguing
for
the
need
for
health
exception
in
fact
were
addressed
by
the
statute.
the
point
at
which
i'm
not
clear
on
your
position
is...
occurs
in
what
you've
said
on
page
11
of
your
yellow
brief,
if
you
could
get
that
out.
do
you
have
the
carry
over
paragraph
on
11?
you
go
through
the
kind
of
a
worst
case
analysis.
and
you
say,
well,
you
know,
assuming
that
all
of
the
safeguards
somehow
do
not
work,
finally,
in
the
unlikely
event
that
a
parent
refuses
to
waive
the
48-hour
waiting
period
and
so
on,
a
doctor
who
performs
an
emergency
abortion
under
such
circumstances
would
not
be
subject
to
either
criminal
prosecution
or
civil
liability
because
his
or
her
conduct
would
not
only
be
constitutionally
protected
but
would
be
independently
justifiable,
and
then
you
cite
the
competing
harms.
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
it
would
be
constitutionally
protected?
i
read
that
as
suggesting
that
there
was
indeed
a
constitutional
requirement
for
some
kind
of
a
health
exception,
but
that
may
not
be
what
you
meant.
what
do
you
mean
by
constitutionally
protected?
what
are
you
getting
at?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
he
said,
"i
may
not
be
prosecuted
under
the
constitution
because.
"
what
follows
"because",
in
your
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
mean
because
there
is
a
required
health
exception?
i
mean,
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
competing
harm.
