justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
just
say
a
word
about
the...
the
ditch...
sorry...
the
word
about
the
wetland
next
to
a
tributary
that's
separated
by
a
man-made
object
like
a
ditch?
are
there
many
such
instances?
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
scientific
question.
are
there
many
such
instances
where
there
is
no
transfer
of
water?
and
in
those
instances,
is
the
presence
of
water
in
the
wetland
anything
more
than
a
coincidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
insofar
as
it
seeks
to
serve
a
purpose
of
the
statute
to
regulate
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
where
do
i
look
to
verify
that
scientific
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
can't
find
any
quantitative
assessment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
now
suppose
we
take
a
set,
which
you
think
exists
as
not
the
null
set,
of
instances
where
there
is
no
such
transfer,
which
your
opponents
say
is
this
case.
now
what's
the
justification
for
regulating
those?
if
it's
simply
flood
control
because
water
flows
over
the
top
and
sits
there,
i
guess
you
could
say
the
same
thing
is
true
of
any
low
depression,
and
therefore,
the
presence
of
water
would
be
just
a
coincidence.
now,
what's
your...
the
fact
that
they're
wet
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
it's
the
fact
that
they're
next
to
a
place
that
floods
that
has
to
do
with
it.
now,
what's
wrong
with
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i
understand
that.
now,
what
specifically,
since
i
think
this
is
scientific,
do
i
look
at
to
verify
what
you
just
said,
namely
that
a
wet
depression,
even
if
there's
no
interchange,
has
a
lot
to
do
with
flood
control
that
a
dry
depression
wouldn't
have?
that's
a
scientific
statement.
where
do
i
verify
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
read
them,
and
i...
i
just
perhaps
wasn't
reading
them
closely
enough,
but
i
just
can't
find
the
verification
directly
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
the
case?
i
read
them
quickly.
i
don't
necessarily
pick
up
everything.
i'll
read
them
again.
but
if
i
don't
find
empirical
verification
for
that
statement,
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
and
where
did
the
agency,
in
its
many,
many
proceedings
over
the
course
of
35
years,
say
what
you
just
said,
namely
that
a
wetland
acts
as
a
sponge?
it's
very
plausible
to
me.
it's
just
that
there
may
be
a
need
to
drop
a
citation
somewhere.
