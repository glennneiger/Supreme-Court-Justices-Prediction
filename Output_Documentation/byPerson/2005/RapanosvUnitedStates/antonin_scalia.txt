justice
antonin
scalia
it
goes
somewhat
beyond
the
smallest
trickle?
doesn't
it?
doesn't
it
also
include
ditches
that
currently
don't
have
any
trickle
if
they
obtain
a
trickle
during
a
rainstorm?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
couldn't
you
simply
assume
that
anything
that
is
discharged
into
a
tributary
ultimately
goes
where
the
tributary
goes?
wouldn't
it
be
enough
to
prove
the
discharge?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
think
it
would
be
enough
for
the...
for
the
government
to
prove
the
discharge
into
a
tributary
in
order
to
prove
that
the
act
has
been
violated.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
think
it
has
to
trace
the
molecules.
justice
antonin
scalia
more
than
that,
mr.
hopper.
i
thought
and
i
had
expected
you
to...
to
respond
to
justice
souter's
question
this
way,
his
question
about
how
come
putting
poison
in...
in
the
wetlands
is
bad,
but
it's
okay
to
put
it
in
the
tributary.
but
they...
as
i
understand
it,
the
reason
we
held
wetlands
were
included
within
the
waters
of
the
united
states
was
not...
not
that,
that
you
could
poison
the
waters
by
poisoning
the
wetlands,
but
rather,
it
was
that
it's
very
hard
to
tell
where
the
navigable
water
ends
and
the
wetland
begins.
and...
and
we
said,
you
know,
we're
not
going
to
parse
that.
if
it's...
if
it's
adjacent
to
a
navigable
water
and
it's
wet,
we're
going
to
say
it's
part
of
a
navigable
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
was
our
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
of
course,
that
basis
doesn't
apply
to
tributaries,
does
it?
you...
you
can
always
tell
where
the
tributary
ends.
it
ends
at
the
point
where
it
goes
into
the
main
river.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
a
hydrological
connection.
do
you
mean
a
constant...
a
constant
body
of
water
between
the
two,
or
do
you
mean
simply
a...
a
drain
that
at
some
times
might
carry
off
rainwater
from...
from
this
land?
and...
would
that...
would
that
suffice
to
be
a
hydrological
connection?
justice
antonin
scalia
water
never
ran
off
of
this...
of
this
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
mr.
stoepker,
your
friend,
mr.
hopper,
would
certainly
not
agree
with
you
that...
that
a...
a
hydrological
connection
is
the,
quote,
traditional
test.
what...
what
is
your
definition
of
tradition?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
long
has
this
test
been
established?
justice
antonin
scalia
traditionally.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
the
inception
of
the
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
that
alone
has
been
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
so
you're...
you're
not
conceding
that...
that
hydrologic...
hydrological
connection
is
adequate.
you're
just...
is
sufficient.
you're
just
saying
it's
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't...
you
don't
have
to
define
what...
everything
that's
necessary.
all
you
have
to
define
is
one
indispensable
element.
and
all
you're
arguing
is
that
a
hydrological
connection
is
an
indispensable
element,
whatever
additional
elements--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
may
be.
so
you
may
agree
with
your
friend,
mr.
hopper.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
just
haven't
reached
that
point.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
set
you
two
to
fighting
with
each
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
we're
talking
about
here
is...
is
at...
at
most,
whether
this
is
a
water
of
the
united
states.
the
condition
for
requiring
permits
is
that
it...
it
be
a
water
of
the
united
states.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
either
is
or
it
isn't,
not...
not
that
it
will
be.
it
either
is
or
it
isn't.
if
it
is,
you...
you
need
a
permit;
if
it
isn't,
you
don't
need
a
permit.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
only
reason
it's
a
water
of
the
united
states
is
that
there
are
some
puddles
on
this
land.
right?
and
if
there
were
no
puddles,
it...
it
wouldn't
be
a
water
of
the
united
states.
it
would
just
be
land
of
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it...
it
becomes
waters
of
the
united
states
because
there
are
puddles
on
it,
and
you
assert
because
those
puddles
have
some
hydrological
connection
or
if
it
is...
if
it
is
water
of
the
united
states,
those
puddles
have
some
hydrological
connections
with
the
navigable
waters.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
the...
the
statute
only
prohibits
the
discharge
of
dredged
or
fill
material,
which
is
what
is
going
on
here,
into
the
navigable
waters,
right,
at
specified
disposal
sites.
i'm
sorry.
the...
the
permits
that...
that
are
required
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--permit
discharge
into
waters,
not...
not
into
lands
that
aren't
waters.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
it...
do
you
think
it
meant
adjacent
with
a
berm
in
between?
i...
i
thought
the
reason
they...
they
reached
that
conclusion
was
you
can't
tell
where
the
navigable
water
ends
and
where
the
wetland
begins.
i...
i
thought
they
assumed
a
connection
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
when
it's
not
a
body
of
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
storm
drain,
even...
even
when
it's
not
filled
with
water,
is
a
tributary.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suggest
it's
very
absurd
to
call
that
waters
of
the
united
states.
it's
a
drainage
ditch
dug...
you
know,
dug
by
the
municipality
or...
you
know,
or
a
gutter
in
a
street.
to
call
that
waters
of
the
united
states
seems
to
me
extravagant.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
percentage
of
the...
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states
do
you
believe
is...
is
subjected
to
permits
from
the
corps
of
engineers
on
your
theory
whenever
you
want
to
move
dirt,
whenever
you
want
to
deposit
sand?
what...
what
percentage
of
the
total
land
mass
of
the
united
states,
if
you
define
tributary
as
broadly
as
you
define
it
to
include?
every
storm
drain?
i
mean,
it's
the
whole
country,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
water
goes
down
to
the
sea
and
there's
some
kind
of
a
drain
or...
or
a
bed
that
takes
the
water
down
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
calling
empty
ditches...
not
unless
you
call
empty
ditches
land,
which
i
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
you...
that's
just
because
this
statute
happens
to
refer
to
wetlands.
but
under
your
theory,
the
corps
of
engineers
would
have
jurisdiction
over
any
land
that
is
part
of
that
tributary
system
as
well.
if
any
of
that
land
has
a
deposit
of...
of
some
materials
that
could
leach
into
or...
or
drain
into
the...
the
tributary
system,
which
is
to
say
any
gutter,
in
theory,
the...
the
federal
government
can
regulate
it
all.
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
1899,
it
just
said
navigable
rivers,
not...
not
every...
every
tributary
defined
to
include
even
storm
drains.
justice
antonin
scalia
adjacent
to
what?
adjacent
to
a
tributary.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
here's...
here's
the
fly
in
the
ointment.
you...
you
interpret
tributary
to
include
storm
drains
and
ditches
that
only
carry
off
rainwater.
i
mean,
it
makes
an
immense
difference
to
the
scope
of
jurisdiction
of
the
corps
of
engineers.
i
mean,
when
you
talk
about
adjacent
to
a
tributary,
i
think,
you
know,
maybe
adjacent
to
the
missouri
river
or
something
like
that.
no.
you're
talking
about
adjacent
to
a
storm
drain.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
because
i
don't
know
how
a
storm
drain
is
a
water
of
the
united
states.
that's
all.
i
mean,
all
of
these
terms
that
you're
throwing
around
somehow
have
to
come
within
a
reasonable
usage
of
the
term,
waters
of
the
united
states,
and
i
do
not
see
how
a
storm
drain
under
anybody's
concept
is
a
water
of
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
was
referring
to
a
real
storm
drain.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
aren't.
but...
but
you
would
sweep
them
all
into
the
jurisdiction
of
the
corps
of
engineers.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that...
but
that
doesn't
follow.
i
mean,
it
is
not
a
principle
of
law
that
so
long
as
the
object
is...
is
lawful
and
within
the
power
of
the
united
states,
all
means
to
achieving
that
object
are
lawful.
that
is
simply
not
true.
there
are
various
means
of
stopping
that
pollution,
and
it
may
well
be
that
one
of
the
means,
which
intrudes
too
deeply
into
the
state's
power
to
regulate
land
within
their
jurisdiction,
is
not
a
permissible
one.
that...
that's
not
an
extraordinary
proposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
non-point
source
pollution
is...
is
any
more
remote
from
what
the
federal
government
should
be
able
to
do
to
achieve
its
ends
than
is
a
point
source
pollution
that...
that
consists
of...
of
dumping
sand
on
land
that
has
some
puddles
on
it.
i...
that
seems
to
me
just
as
remote.
justice
antonin
scalia
though
not
necessarily
as
far
as
storm
drains.
it
would
be
enough
to...
to
say
navigable...
you
know,
non-navigable
tributaries
that
are
real...
real
tributaries.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
very
vague
indication.
i
mean,
i...
i
agree
with
you
that
your
argument
based
on
404(g)
is
a
strong
one,
but
it...
it
perhaps
is
weakened
if
you
believe
that
in
order
to
stretch
to
the...
to
the
limit
of
federal
jurisdiction,
you
need
a
clear
statement.
i
certainly
wouldn't
consider
404(g)...
if...
if
the
act
did
not
previously
include
the
kind
of
authority
you're
arguing
for,
i
would
not...
i
would
not
consider
404(g)
a
clear
statement
of
that...
of
that
new...
new
authority.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
that
the
authority
of...
i
don't...
i
don't
even
think
the
corps
has
ever
suggested
this.
the
authority
of
the
corps
extends
not
only
to
all
that
you've...
we've
been
talking
about
and
that
you've
asserted,
but
also
to
lands
that,
if
altered,
could
have
some
hydrological
connection.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is...
what
is
the
basis
for
their
doing
it?
if
there
is
currently
no
hydrological
connection,
there
is
a
berm,
there
is
no...
there
is
no
connection
to
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united...
what
could
possibly
be
the
basis
for
their
asserting
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
statute
could
do
that.
a
statute
could
do
that.
but
this
statute
requires
that
it
be
a
water
of
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
when...
when
there
is
nothing
but
puddles
that
are
isolated
by
a
berm,
even
from
the
storm
drain
which
goes
to
tributaries,
i
can't
conceive
of...
of
how
you
could
consider
that
that's...
you
know,
at
least
where
it
leaks
sometimes
into
the
storm
drain
and
went
down
to
a
tributary,
i
think
it's
an
exaggeration,
but
maybe
you
could
call
it
a
water
of
the
united
states.
but
where
there's
a
berm
that
prevents
any
water
from
going
even
into
the
storm
drain
which
then
goes
into
a
tributary,
how
can
you
possibly
consider
that
a
water
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
argument
i
was
addressing.
i'm
addressing
the
argument
that
in
changing
the
land,
you
may
cause
it
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
happy
to
hear
that.
that's
all
i
was
trying
to
establish.
you...
you
don't
assert
that
that's
an
independent
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hopper,
i
hope
you're
going
to
tell
us
what
you
make
of
section
404(g).
justice
antonin
scalia
these
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
6th
circuit.
i
am
announcing
the
judgment
of
the
court,
which
is
to
vacate
and
remand
these
cases
for
further
proceedings.
my
opinion,
which
i
will
now
summarize,
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
thomas
and
alito.
the
clean
water
act
makes
it
illegal
without
a
permit
from
the
corps
of
engineers
to
discharge
dredged
or
fill
material
into,
“the
waters
of
the
united
states”.
getting
an
individual
permit
can
be
enormously
expensive
--
over
$1.7
billion
is
spent
in
obtaining
them
each
year
--
and
the
corps’
regulations
allow
denial
of
permits
not
only
for
environmental
reasons,
but
also
because
of
economics,
aesthetics,
recreation
and,
“in
general,
the
needs
and
welfare
of
the
people”,
factors
no
less
expansive
than
those
taken
into
account
by
state
and
local
authorities
for
land-use
zoning.
the
two
cases
before
us
concern
wetlands
--
that
is,
lands
sufficiently
saturated
at
least
part
of
the
time
to
support
aquatic
vegetation
--
wetlands
in
michigan.
most
of
this
land
lies
near
ditches
or
manmade
drains
that
eventually
empty
into
navigable
waters.
petitioners
are
developers,
who
claim
the
right
to
backfill
these
lots
without
getting
a
permit.
no
one
here
contends
that
intrastate
wetland
such
as
this
are,
ipso
facto,
waters
of
the
united
states,
and
our
opinions
make
clear
that
they
are
not.
the
6th
circuit
held,
however,
that
these
wetlands
were
covered
by
the
act,
because
the
nearby
ditches
and
drains
constituted
tributaries
of
navigable
waters
and
because
the
wetlands
were
adjacent
to
those
tributaries,
both
by
reason
of
their
physical
proximity
and
by
reason
of
their
hydrologic
connection
to
it.
the
6th
circuit
holding
is
in
accord
with
the
corps’
regulations,
which
define
“waters
of
the
united
states”
to
include,
among
other
things,
wetlands
adjacent
to
waters
of
the
united
states;
and
the
corps
means
by
“adjacent”
not
just
a
butting,
but
also
nearby
or
having
some
hydrologic
connection;
and
the
regulations
define
“waters
of
the
united
states”
to
include
tributaries
of
those
waters
and
defines
“tributaries”
to
include
any
channel
that
contains
a
visible
mark
of
the
passage
of
water,
such
as
a
high
waterline
of
litter
or
debris,
even
if
the
channel
is
ordinarily
dry
and
contains
water
only
during
rainfall.
thus,
under
its
regulations,
the
corps
has
asserted
permitting
jurisdiction
over,
as
waters
of
the
united
states,
storm
sewers,
manmade
drainage
ditches
miles
from
traditional
waterways
and
arid
canyons
connected
to
waters
only
through
the
flow
of
groundwater
over
centuries
and
even
desert
washes
that
hold
rainwater
once
a
year;
and
it
has
also
asserted
jurisdiction
over
wetlands
adjacent
to
these
features,
by
which
it
means
wetlands
nearby,
even
if
separated
by
a
70-foot-wide
impermeable
dike
over
which
automobiles
travel,
wetlands
that
are
connected
to
united
states
waters
by
sheet
flow
of
rainwater
during
storms
and
wetlands
connected
to
such
waters
by
flooding
once
every
100
years.
the
corps
convinced
one
district
court
that
a
wetland
was
adjacent
simply
because,
“water
molecules
currently
present
in
the
wetlands”,
we’re
sure
at
some
point,
no
matter
when
or
how,
to,
“intermingle
with
water”
from
a
navigable
river.
based
on
its
understanding
of
adjacent
wetlands,
the
court
has
asserted
jurisdiction
over
270
to
300
million
acres
of
wetlands,
including
half
of
alaska
and
an
area
the
size
of
california
in
the
lower
48
states.
and
based
on
its
definition
of
tributary,
any
channel
that
contains
a
visible
mark
of
passage
of
water,
no
matter
how
rarely
the
water
passes,
constitutes
a
covered
tributary
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
this
includes
storm
sewers
in
major
cities
and
dry
washes
in
immense
arid
deserts.
thus,
a
vast
portion
of
the
nation’s
dry
land
potentially
constitutes
waters.
we
think
all
this
departs
very
much
indeed
from
what
the
statute
provides.
with
regard
to
tributaries,
the
act
authorizes
jurisdiction
only
over
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
used
in
the
plural
and
with
a
definite
article,
this
term
refers
only,
in
the
words
of
the
dictionary
definition
to
water,
“as
found
in
streams
and
bodies
forming
geographical
features
such
as
oceans,
rivers
and
lakes”.
a
country’s
waters
do
not
include
dry
channels,
desert
washes
or
storm
gutters.
they
include
streams,
rivers,
lakes,
oceans
--
in
short,
relatively
permanent,
continuously
standing
or
flowing
bodies
of
water.
the
act
itself
distinguishes
conveyances
that
typically
contain
intermittent
flows
of
waters,
such
as
ditches,
channels
and
conduits,
from
permanent
bodies
of
water
by
defining
the
former
separately
as
“point
sources”,
not
as
“waters
of
the
united
states”.
and
the
corps’
broad
interpretation
is
inconsistent
with
the
act’s
stated
purpose
of
preserving
the
state’s
primary
responsibility
to
plan
the
development
and
use
of
land
resources,
because
it
makes
the
federal
government
a
de
facto
regulator
of
huge
tracts
of
intrastate
land.
a
waterlogged
log
in
the
middle
of
a
town
become
subject
to
the
corps’
permitting
authority
rather
than
the
town’s
zoning
authority,
simply
because
it
is
adjacent
to
a
storm
drain.
we
ordinarily
expect
a
clear
and
manifest
statement
from
congress
to
authorize
agency
action
that
pushes
to
the
limits
of
congress’s
commerce
power
or
that
intrudes
upon
an
area
of
traditional
state
responsibility,
such
as
land-use
regulation.
the
corps’
interpretation
does
both
with
no
clear
and
manifest
statement
other
than
“the
waters
of
the
united
states”.
as
for
the
corps’
expansive
definition
of
“adjacent”,
it
must
be
understood,
first
of
all,
that
the
notion
of
adjacency
does
not
come
from
the
statute;
rather,
it
comes
from
one
of
our
opinions,
called
riverside
bayview,
in
which
we
held
that
wetlands
adjacent
to
covered
waters,
in
the
sense
that
they
actually
abutted
covered
waters,
were
also
covered
by
the
act.
the
reason
we
included
those
wetlands
was
that
there
is
an
inherent
boundary-drawing
problem
between
waters
and
the
adjoining
wetlands
that
they
gradually
blend
into.
when
a
swamp
borders
on
a
river
or
lake,
there
is
no
clear
line
showing
where
the
water
ends
and
the
wetland
begins.
because
of
this
inherent
ambiguity,
we
held
that
the
corps’
inclusion
of
“adjacent”
--
that
is,
“abutting”
--
wetlands
as
waters
of
the
united
states
was
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute.
of
course,
wetlands
that
are
physically
separate
from
covered
waters
do
not
present
such
a
boundary-drawing
problem
and
cannot
be
included
as
waters
of
the
united
states
or
indeed
as
waters
at
all.
the
fact
that
such
wetlands
may
have
an
ecological
relationship
to
waters
of
the
united
states
does
not
mean
that
they
are
waters
of
the
united
states.
we
held
that
in
a
case
called
swancc
--
that’s
an
acronym
for
solid
waste
agency
of
northern
cook
county
--
which
squarely
rejected
the
notion
that
the
ecological
connection
between
isolated
ponds
and
waters
of
the
united
states
was
enough
to
render
them
covered.
therefore,
in
order
for
a
wetland
that
neighbors
a
ditch
or
drain
to
constitute
part
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states,
two
criteria
must
be
satisfied:
first,
the
nearby
channel
must
contain
a
relatively
permanent
body
of
water
that
would
normally
be
described
as
a
stream,
river
or
lake,
not
merely
intermittent
or
ephemeral
flows
of
water;
second,
the
wetland
must
have
a
continuous
surface
connection
to
the
nearby
water,
making
it
difficult
to
determine
where
the
water
ends
and
the
land
begins.
only
wetlands
that
are
continuously
physically
connected
to
relatively
permanent
waters
are
part
of
those
waters.
our
opinion
describes
why
this
test
will
not
at
all
imperil
the
ability
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
prevent
the
discharge
of
liquid
pollution
into
sewers,
ditches
or
other
conduits.
it
merely
reduces
the
corps’
asserted
jurisdiction
to
demand
permitting
for
the
introduction
of
solid
fill
into
wetlands.
many
claims
have
been
made
in
these
cases
about
the
environmental
benefits
achieved
by
the
corps’
expansive
regulation
of
wetlands.
even
if
these
claims
are
true,
they
cannot
justify
a
patently
unreasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
congress
may,
if
it
wishes,
expand
the
corps’
jurisdiction
beyond
what
the
statute
now
clearly
provides;
but
we
cannot.
the
6th
circuit
thus
did
not
apply
the
correct
legal
standard
to
decide
these
cases.
we
would
vacate
the
judgments
in
both
cases
and
remand
them
for
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens,
who
will
describe
his
own
opinion,
would
uphold
the
corps’
regulations
in
their
entirety;
so
what
i
have
said
in
opposition
to
the
regulations
responds
to
his
opinion,
as
well;
justice
kennedy,
however,
who
will
also
describe
his
opinion,
does
not
uphold
the
corps’
regulations,
but
proposes
a
criterion
of
his
own.
ignoring
the
text
of
the
statute,
he
focuses
on
the
phrase
“significant
nexus”,
which
we
used
in
the
swancc
case
to
describe
the
relationship
between
an
abutting
wetland
and
the
waters
it
abuts.
as
though
this
phrase
were
the
statutory
test
of
jurisdiction,
rather
than
a
line
from
one
of
our
opinions,
justice
kennedy
reasons
that
such
a
significant
nexus
exists
and
therefore
corps
jurisdiction
exists
whenever
a
storm
drain,
desert
wash,
intermittent
stream
or
wetland,
“significantly
affects”,
the
quality
of
waters
of
the
united
states.
this
is
in
its
effects
not
an
unreasonable
disposition.
it
just
happens
not
to
be
the
disposition
adopted
by
congress.
something
that
significantly
affects
waters
of
the
united
states
does
not
become
waters
of
the
united
states,
which
is
the
jurisdictional
test
that
congress
has
provided.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer
join;
and
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
