chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
rapanos
v.
united
states
and
carabell
v.
the
united
states
army
corps
of
engineers.
mr.
hopper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you...
how
do
you
define
a
tributary?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what's
your
definition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
what
you
object
to,
and
i
know
that
you
think
your
client
isn't
covered.
but
i
don't
know
what
test
you
would
have
us
adopt
for
what
constitutes
a
tributary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
okay,
but
we
still
don't
know
what
you're
excluding.
i
mean,
the
missouri
is
a
tributary
of
the
mississippi,
but
i
assume
it's
still
covered.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if...
but
your...
but
your
answer
earlier
to
justice
souter's
earlier
question
was
that
if
you
dump
the
pollutants
anywhere
and
they
make
their
way
to
the
navigable
water,
you're
covered.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stoepker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
we
talk
about
a
hydrological
connection
in
riverside
bayview?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
get
back
to
the
question
earlier?
what
is
a
hydrological
connection?
is
it
enough
if
the
water
seeps
through
the
ground
and
underground
is
connected
with
the
navigable
water,
or
does
there
have
to
be
a
ditch
or...
or
a
culvert
that
you
can
see
the
water
flowing
through?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what...
what
is
the
test
that
you
would
have
us
adopt
for
a
significant
nexus?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
by
that,
you
mean
either
a
ditch
or
underground
seepage?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
there
has...
there
has
to
be
any...
and
any
hydrological
connection
works.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
hopper
won't
like
that,
but
for--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
may
respond
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
define
tributary?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
tributary...
you
say
they're
adjacent
to
a
nonnavigable
tributary.
that's
a...
a
culvert,
a
ditch.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
the
rapanos'
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about...
what
about
the
other...
the
other
sites?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
argument
assumes
that
the
ditches
that
go
to
the
other
two
sites
are
also
tributaries.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well...
well,
as
you
mention
that,
you
cited
subsection
(7),
and
there's
a...
what
struck
me
anyway
as
a
very
interesting
provision
in
there.
it
covers
wetlands
adjacent
to
waters
other
than
waters
that
are
themselves
wetlands.
now,
everything
that
you've
said
today
and
in
your
brief
would
lead
me
to
think
you
would
contend
that
wetlands
that
are
adjacent
to
wetlands
ought
to
be
covered
as
well,
and
yet,
the
regulation
leaves
them
out.
and
i
want
to
know
why
do
you
think
the
regulation
leaves
those
wetlands
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
me
it...
it
suggests
that
even
the
corps
recognized
that
at
some
point
you've
got
to
say
stop
because
logically
any
drop
of
water
anywhere
is
going
to
have
some
sort
of
connection
through
drainage.
and
they're...
they're
stopping
there,
and
i
wonder
if
we
ought
to
take
that
same
instinct
that...
that
you
see
in
subsection
(7)
and
apply
it
to
your
definition
of
tributary
and
say,
at
some
point,
the
definition
of
tributary
has
to
have
an
end.
otherwise,
you're
going
to
go
and
reach
too
far,
beyond
what
congress
reasonably
intended.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
true
of
the
wetland
that
is
adjacent
to
the
wetland
that
is
adjacent
to
the
tributary,
and
yet,
the
corps
says
we're
not
going
to
reach
the
wetland
that
is
adjacent
to
another
wetland.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
we
didn't
come
up
with
the
idea
of
wetlands
next
to
wetlands.
the
corps
of
engineers
has
it
in
their
regulations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
do
they
mean
by
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what...
what
is
an
example
of
an
insignificant
nexus
under
the
swancc
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
there's
no
nexus
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're
isolated.
there's
no
nexus.
the...
the
notion
in
swancc
of
a
significant
nexus
suggests
that
there
are
some
bodies
of
water
or
puddles
that
are
going
to
have
a
nexus,
but
it's
not
going
to
be
significant
enough.
we
didn't
just
say
any
nexus.
it
said
significant
nexus.
so
what
are
you
leaving
out
to
give
meaning
to
the
test
that
we
articulated
in
swancc?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
have
a
wetland,
you
would
say
a
wetland
with
a
hydrological
connection
to
a
tributary
of
navigable
waters
through
one
drop
a
year
is
a
significant
nexus
to
the
waters
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
drop.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
am
i
right
that
a
tributary
is
not
a
defined
term
in
the
regulations?
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
really
fair.
the
petitioners,
as
i
understand
it,
both
concede
the
discharges
that
make
their
way
into
the
navigable
waters
would
be
covered.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
you
wanted
a
cite
for
the
opposite
proposition,
you
could
cite
subsection
(7)
of
the
corps'
regulations
where
they
have
no
interest
in
wetlands
that
happen
to
be
adjacent
to
other
wetlands
that
are
adjacent
to
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
if
they
act
in
the
way
that
you've
been
postulating,
presumably
they'd
want
to
cover
those
adjacent
wetlands
just
as
much
as
they
want
to
cover
the
wetlands
that
are
next
to
the
tributary,
but
they
don't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
other
than
waters
that
are
themselves
wetlands.
it
excludes
all
wetlands
that
are
adjacent
to
wetlands
that
are
adjacent
to
waters
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you...
you
put
a
lot
of
weight
on
the
tributary
question
in
your
approach
by
giving
up
the
hydrological
connection.
your
response
is
you
don't
need
a
hydrological
connection
because
it's
right
next
to
a
tributary.
but
for
those
of
us
who
are
having
a
little
trouble
with
the
concept
of
tributary,
you
don't
leave
us
much
to
fall
back
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
hopper,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
may
respond
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
scalia

announcement
in
04-1034,
rapanos
versus
united
states,
and
04-1384,
