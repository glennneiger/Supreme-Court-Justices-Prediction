am
i
correct--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
ask
one
clarifying
question?
was
it
found
that
there
was
no
connection,
or
was
it
not
found
that
there
was
a
connection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was.
i
didn't
read
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
follow
you.
you
say
that
somewhere
on
page
82
there
is
a
finding
that
there
was
no
hydrological
connection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
find
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
agree
with
that.
i'm
asking
you
if
they
found
there
was
no
hydrological
connection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
on
page
82.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
page
are
you
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
still
puzzled--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--by
your
answer
to
justice--
[laughter]
--justice
kennedy.
what
if
there's
no
hydrological
connection
today,
but
there
would
be
after
you...
after
you
built
your
project?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it...
would
it
be
a
sufficient
reason
to
deny
a
permit
based
on
the
judgment
that
after
the
project
is
completed,
there
will
be
a...
a
hydrological
connection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
it
seems
to
me
you
could
answer
that
yes
or
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
you
don't
want
to
but--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
sort
of
foolish
to
say
that
we're
concerned
about
pollution,
but
only
if
you...
only
if
you
catch
it
in
advance?
that
doesn't
make
sense
because
if
the
problem
would
arise
when
you
did
what
you're
seeking
a
permit
to
do,
why
shouldn't
you
be
denied
the
permit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
my
hypothesis
is
that
we
know
it
would
happen,
or
they...
they
would
find
it
would
happen
after
the
project
is
completed.
and
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
that's
what
you
should
focus
on
rather
than
what's...
you
know,
rather
than
what
happens
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
when
we're
talking
about
the
scope
of...
of
federal
power,
we're
not
merely
concerned
with
dumping
refuse
in
the
creek,
but
also
deliberate
attempts
to
poison
the
water
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
the
fact
that
the
states
have
the
power
and
the
interest
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
federal
government
does
not
also
have
the
power.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
dissenting
opinion
is
joined
by
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer.
in
1969,
the
cuyahoga
river
in
cleveland,
ohio,
coated
with
a
slick
of
industrial
waste,
actually
caught
fire.
congress
responded
to
that
dramatic
event
and
others
like
it
by
enacting
the
clean
water
act.
the
text
of
the
statute
states
that
it
was
intended
to
restore
and
maintain
the
chemical,
physical
and
biological
integrity
of
the
nation’s
waters.
it
proclaimed
the
ambitious
goal
of
ending
water
pollution
by
1985.
the
cost
of
achieving
that
goal
persuaded
president
nixon
to
veto
the
statute;
but
both
houses
of
congresses
voted
to
override
that
veto
by
overwhelming
margins.
the
clean
water
act
is
fairly
characterized
as
watershed
legislation.
it
endorsed
fundamental
changes
in
both
the
purpose
and
the
scope
of
federal
regulation
of
the
nation’s
waters.
whereas
earlier
statutes
had
assigned
to
the
army
corps
of
engineers
the
task
of
regulating
navigable
water
in
order
to
protect
their
use
as
highways
for
the
transportation
of
goods
in
interstate
commerce,
the
clean
water
act
broadened
the
corps’
mission
to
include
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
quality
of
the
nation’s
waters
for
aesthetic,
health,
recreational
and
environmental
purposes.
the
statute
did
not
define
a
new
category
of
non-navigable
waters
that
the
corps
was
authorized
to
regulate;
instead,
congress
simply
redefined
the
term
“navigable
waters”
to
encompass
all
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
congress
gave
the
corps
the
authority
to
control
pollution
in
what
were
formerly
non-navigable
waters,
not
by
defining
their
connection
to
navigable
waters,
but
rather
by
categorically
defining,
for
statutory
purposes,
as,
“navigable
waters”.
the
statutory
definition
in
the
clean
water
act
does
not
contain
any
requirement
of
either
actual
or
potential
navigability.
in
order
to
achieve
the
goal
of
cleaning
up
the
waters
of
the
united
states,
congress
assigned
broad
regulatory
powers
to
two
executive
agencies,
the
army
corps
of
engineer
and
the
environmental
protection
agency,
two
agencies
that
can
employ
scientists
and
technicians
having
expertise
in
such
matters
as
flood
control,
wildlife
protection
and
pollution,
matters
that
are
not
particularly
familiar
to
graduates
of
law
schools.
they
had
assigned
the
agencies
to
draft
and
enforce
regulations
to
achieve
the
statute’s
ambitious
goal.
after
debate
both
within
the
agencies
and
in
congress,
they
agreed
on
regulations
that
prohibit
the
filling
of
marshes,
swamps
and
other
wetlands
adjacent
to
tributaries
of
navigable
waters
without
first
obtaining
a
permit
from
the
corps.
and
of
course,
if
it
was
a
de
minimis
problem,
the
corps
would
issue
the
permit.
the
narrow
issue
presented
by
these
two
cases
is
whether
the
petitioners
may
fill
some
66
acres
of
marshy
wetlands
in
southeastern
michigan
in
order
to
develop
the
properties
commercially
without
the
permission
of
the
army
corps.
because
each
of
their
opinions
--
that
is,
justice
scalia’s
opinion
and
justice
kennedy’s
opinion
--
explains
why
the
other’s
is
unfaithful
to
the
statute,
i
shall
merely
explain
why
those
in
dissent
agree
with
the
corps,
with
the
unanimous
view
of
the
district
and
circuit
judges
who
reviewed
the
evidence
in
these
two
cases
and
with
the
solicitor
general,
who
represents
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
that
the
fact
that
these
wetlands
are
adjacent
to
tributaries
of
navigable
waters
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction.
the
corps
has
simply
applied
the
plain
language
of
regulations
that
have
been
in
place
for
over
30
years
that
were
implicitly
approved
by
congress
when
it
amended
the
statute
in
1977,
that
were
endorsed
by
this
court’s
unanimous
decision
in
riverside
bayview
case
in
1985
and
that
have
been
enforced
in
case
after
case
after
case
for
over
three
decades.
thus,
the
issue
presented
to
us
when
we
granted
certiorari
did
not
involve
any
conflict
among
the
lower
courts;
it
was
an
issue
had
been
well-settled
by
all
three
branches
of
our
government
since
at
least
1985.
today,
however,
five
justices
have
decided
to
upset
a
well-settled
balance.
rather
than
continuing
to
defer
to
the
corps’
longstanding
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
congress
authorized
them
to
administer,
they
have
come
up
with
two
separate
approaches.
not
only
are
both
approaches
wrong,
as
each
of
them
explains
in
his
criticism
of
the
other’s
opinion;
but
more
significantly,
their
joint
conclusion
represents
an
unwise
shift
in
our
jurisprudence.
since
our
unanimous
decision
in
1984
in
chevron
against
the
national
resources
defense
council
--
an
opinion,
by
the
way,
that
i
am
rather
proud
of
--
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
if
statutory
language
is
ambiguous,
we
should
uphold
any
reasonable
interpretation
adopted
by
the
expert
agency
entrusted
by
congress
with
enforcing
the
statute.
yet,
neither
justice
scalia
nor
justice
kennedy
pays
more
than
lip
service
to
this
well-settled
principle.
the
approach
that
the
four
of
us
in
dissent
would
take,
by
contrast,
follows
directly
from
our
unanimous
opinions
in
riverside
bayview
and
chevron.
riverside
bayview
recognized
that
the
phrase
“waters
of
the
united
states”
is
exactly
the
sort
of
ambiguous
language
that
gives
rise
to
deference
under
chevron.
the
corps
has
interpreted
this
phrase
to
cover
wetlands
adjacent
to
tributaries
of
traditionally
navigable
waters.
given
the
importance
of
wetlands
for
water
quality,
for
flood
control
and
the
need
to
prevent
pollution
at
its
source,
treating
all
such
wetlands
as
waters
of
the
united
states
is
eminently
reasonable.
an
unusual
feature
of
today’s
judgment
merits
a
final
comment.
while
five
justices
have
voted
to
vacate
the
court
of
appeals’
judgment
in
these
two
cases,
the
two
controlling
opinions
propose
two
very
different
tests
for
the
courts
to
follow
on
remand.
because
all
of
the
justices
who
have
joined
my
dissent
would
uphold
the
corps’
jurisdiction
in
both
cases,
on
remand,
the
court
should
find
that
the
corps
has
jurisdiction
if
either
justice
scalia’s
or
justice
kennedy’s
test
is
met.
in
addition
to
joining
my
dissent,
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
separate
dissent
explaining
that
when
congress
used
the
term
“waters
of
the
united
states”
in
the
clean
water
act,
it
intended
to
exercise
its
full
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
