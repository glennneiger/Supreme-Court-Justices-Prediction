well,
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
what
works
in
your
favor
is...
is
it
swancc?
i
don't...
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
to
pronounce
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
migratory
bird
rule
case
where
we
said
there
had
to
be
a
significant
nexus.
but
i
think
what
the
court
is
asking
you
is...
is
how
to
define
significant
nexus.
we're...
if
you
want
us
just
to
say,
well,
this
case
is
too
much,
but
then
the
corps
of
engineers
should
use
its
expertise
to
come
up
with
a
new
regulation,
that's
rather
an
odd
opinion
for
us
to
write.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
it...
was
it
also
clear
that
after
the
improvement,
there
would
be
no
drainage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
still
not
clear
as
to
what
the
findings
were,
if
there
were
findings,
as
to
what
the
condition
would
be
after
the
improvement.
would
there
be
an
increased
likelihood
of
drainage
into
the
ditch
after
the
improvement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
if
that
were
so,
would
that
be
sufficient
for
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
well...
suppose
the
interaction
were
automatic.
would
that
suffice
to
make
this
a
wetlands
after
the
improvement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your...
your
theory
is
there
is
regulatory
authority
because
there's
an
interaction
between
the
wetlands
or
the
lands
in
question
and
the
navigable
waters.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
wasn't...
wasn't
the
reason
for
including
the
adjacent
wetlands
because
of...
of
the
likelihood
of
an
interaction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let...
well,
please
finish.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
assumption--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
this...
this
is
preliminary
to
my
question.
in
swancc,
we
said
there
has
to
be
a
significant
nexus.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
show
that
there's
some
significant
relation
between
the
wetlands
you're
regulating
or
seeking
to
regulate
and
the
navigable
water.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
and
that's
just,
it
seemed
to
me,
so
far
been
missing
from
the
discussion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
about
the
chief
justice's
question,
wetlands
next
to
wetlands?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
congress
in
1972
also,
in
its
statement
of
policy,
said
it's
a
statement
of
policy
to
reserve
to
the
states
the
power
and
the
responsibility
to
plan
land
use
and
water
resources.
and
under
your
definition,
i...
i
just
see
that
we're
giving
no
scope
at
all
to
that
clear
statement
of
the
congressional
policy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
separate
opinion
in
these
consolidated
cases
agrees
that
they
should
be
remanded,
and
for
that
reason
the
opinion
is
a
concurrence
in
the
judgment.
the
statute
here
is
difficult.
it
uses
the
term
“navigable
waters”;
but
by
that
term,
it
means
something
other
than
waters
that
can
be
navigated
by
boat,
and
the
separate
opinions
today
confront
this
difficulty
in
various
ways.
in
my
view,
the
correct
approach
has
already
been
stated
by
the
court’s
opinion
in
our
most
recent
case
on
the
topic,
the
swancc
case
to
which
justice
scalia
has
just
referred.
there,
the
court
said
the
regulation
can
be
sustained
if
there
is
a
significant
nexus
with
the
waters
that
are
navigable
in
the
usual
sense.
an
application
of
this
standard
in
today’s
cases
leads
me
to
agree
with
the
plurality
that
the
cases
must
be
remanded;
but
in
most
cases,
my
interpretation
of
the
act
would
be
closer
to
that
stated
in
the
dissent.
the
limits
the
plurality
would
impose,
in
my
view,
give
insufficient
deference
to
congress’s
purposes
of
enacting
the
clean
water
act
and
to
the
authority
of
the
executives
to
implement
the
statutory
mandate.
as
one
example,
the
plurality
asserts
that
the
extent
of
the
term
“navigable
waters”
may
be
confined
as
it
proposes,
because
the
deposit
of
fill
material,
such
as
dredge,
spoil,
rock,
sand
and
the
like,
requires
different
treatment
from
discharges
of
soluble
pollutants,
such
as
toxic
waste.
yet,
the
act’s
prohibition
on
the
discharge
of
pollutants
into
navigable
waters
covers
both
these
forms
of
pollution,
the
discharge
of
fill
and
the
discharge
of
toxic
materials.
one
reason
for
the
parallel
treatment
may
be
that
the
discharge
of
fill
material
can
impure
downstream
water
quality.
it
seems
plausible
that
new
or
loose
fill
not
anchored
by
grass
or
roots
from
other
vegetation
could
travel
downstream
through
waterways
adjacent
to
a
wetland;
at
least
this
is
a
factual
possibility
that
the
corps’
experts
can
better
assess
than
we
can.
silt,
whether
from
natural
or
human
sources,
is
a
major
factor
in
aquatic
environments.
they
clog
waterway,
alter
ecosystems.
it
may
also
and
does
limit
the
useful
life
of
dams.
sediment
builds
up
on
the
reservoir
side
of
the
main
dam
wall,
and
to
date
there
is
just
no
solution
for
this
other
than
to
say
that
the
dam’s
life
is
limited.
there
is
also
another
reason
for
the
parallel
treatment.
as
the
court
observed
in
riverside
bayview
homes,
also
referred
to
by
all
of
the
opinions
and
just
mentioned
by
justice
scalia,
the
corps
has
concluded
that
wetlands
may
serve
to
filter
and
purify
water
draining
into
adjacent
bodies
of
water
and
to
slow
the
flow
of
surface
runoffs
into
lakes,
rivers
and
streams
and
thus
prevent
flooding
and
erosion.
where
wetlands
perform
these
filterings
and
runoff-control
functions,
filling
them
may
increase
downstream
pollution,
much
as
the
discharge
of
toxic
pollutants
would.
in
many
cases,
moreover,
filling
in
wetlands
separated
from
another
water
by
a
berm
or
other
barrier
can
mean
that
floodwater
impurities
or
runoff
that
would
have
been
stored
and
contained
in
the
wetlands
will
instead
flow
out
to
major
waterways.
with
these
concerns
in
mind,
the
corps’
definition
of
“adjacency”,
which
the
plurality
opinion
would
reject,
is
a
reasonable
one.
in
many
instances,
it
may
be
the
absence
of
an
interchange
of
water
prior
to
the
dredge-and-fill
activities
that
makes
the
protection
of
the
wetlands
critical
to
the
statutory
scheme.
the
significant
nexus
requirement,
then,
in
my
view,
is
responsive
to
these
concerns.
in
both
the
consolidated
cases
before
us,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
the
significant
nexus
standard,
and
in
both
cases,
as
acclaimed
in
my
opinion,
the
record
contains
evidence
suggesting
the
possible
existence
of
that
nexus.
nevertheless,
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
agency
considered
all
of
the
factors
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
wetlands
in
question
had
or
did
not
have
this
requisite
nexus.
although
the
end
result
in
these
cases
may
be
the
same
as
that
suggested
by
the
dissent
--
namely,
that
the
corps’
assertion
of
jurisdiction
is
valid
--
i
believe
a
remand
is
necessary
for
a
consideration
of
the
issues
in
the
proper
terms.
