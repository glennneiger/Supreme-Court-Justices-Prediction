so
where
would
you...
where
would...
where
would
you
put
the
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then...
but
you
were...
you
are
including
at
least
wetlands
that
abut--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--navigable
water.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
major
tributaries?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
ones?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
your
position
no
tributaries
or
some
tributaries?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
from
everything...
from
everything
you
said,
it
sounds
like
you're...
you're
taking
issue
with
riverside
bayview
because
if
a
wetland
adjacent
to
the
river
counts,
then
why
not
a
stream
that
goes
right
into
it?
what
sense
does
that
distinction
make?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
think
that's
correct
about
what
the
court
said
in
bayview
when
it
phrased
the
question
as
before
discharging
fill
material
into
wetlands
adjacent
to
navigable
bodies
of
water
and
their
tributaries.
that's
what
the
court
thought
it
was
deciding
in
riverside
bayview.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
any
rate,
they
could
not
have
been
making
the
distinction
justice
scalia
suggested
if,
at
least
in
the
court's
thinking,
the
tributaries
rolled
right
into
the
navigable
body.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what
was
the
reason
they
gave
for
rejecting
the
permit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
one
question
about
your...
your
not...
no
hydrological
connection?
if
this
berm
were
next
to
a
wetland
that
would
otherwise
be
adjacent
to
a
river,
the
situation
that
was
presented
in
riverside
bayview,
is
it
the
berm
that
prevents
there
being
a
hydrological
connection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
could...
there
could
be
a
situation
where
the
wetlands
would
be
right
next
to
the
river,
but
there's
a
berm
in
between,
and
that
would
break
the
hydrological
connection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
told
that
one
of
them
was
much
closer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
pine
river?
are
you...
that's
not
20
miles
away,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know?
the...
the
solicitor
general
represented
to
us
that
it
was
very
close.
are
you
disputing
that
as
a
matter
of
fact?
