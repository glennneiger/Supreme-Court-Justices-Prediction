mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
after
years
of
review
by
the
state
of
michigan
and
the
respondent,
the
record
is
very
clear.
petitioners'
wetland
is
hydrologically
isolated
from
any
navigable
water
of
the
united
states.
further,
the
state
of
michigan,
exercising
the
power
specifically
and
traditionally
reserved
to
it,
undertook
responsibility
to
regulate
the
waters
at
issue
and
pollution
and,
in
doing
so,
issued
petitioner
a
wetland
permit.
it
is
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
hydrological
connection
between
the
petitioners'
wetland
and
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
referring
to
the
appendix
filed,
the
joint
appendix
filed
in
this
case,
specifically
beginning
with
the
epa
letters
dating
back
to
1994,
as
this
property
has
been
under
years
of
review,
[*15]
do
not
reference
any
such
connection.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
the...
the
connection
there
was...
in
essence,
yes,
your
honor,
based
upon
the
inseparable,
bound-up
nature
of
those
wetlands
which
were
immediately
adjacent
to
the
navigable
water.
there
was
nothing
that
separated
those
wetlands
from
that
specific
body
of
water.
they
were
immediately
adjacent
and
intersected
with
that
body
of
water.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
in...
in
this
case,
your
honor,
there
was
no
connection
at
all.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
connection
identified.
it
was
speculated
that
there
might
be
a
potential--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--no.
if
you
look...
that
is
correct.
if
you
look
at
the
circuit
court
opinion,
it...
and
even
the
district
court
opinion
and
the
findings
made,
there
is
no
finding
that
any
water
has
ever
left
the
petitioners'
wetland
into
the
ditch.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
in...
in
this
case--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--in
the
respondents'
brief
on
page
18,
they
acknowledge
that
the
traditional
test
has
been
hydrological
connection,
that
that's
what
they
have
looked
towards.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
under
the
act,
it
talks
about
the
issue
of
discharge.
that
is
the...
that
is
the
matter
that
is
being
regulated
by
the
statute,
an
actual
discharge
into
the
navigable
body
of
water.
if
you
have
an
hydrologically
isolated
body
of
water,
you
cannot
physically
have
a
discharge
into
the
navigable
stream.
it
is
an
impossibility.
and
therefore,
the
act
does
not
allow
the
speculation
that
the
court
is
referring
to
here.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
that
is
correct.
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
identify
a
connection
between
this
wetland
and
this
non-navigable
ditch.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
our
definition--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--if
you
look
at
respondents'
brief
in
their
arguments
to
this
court,
they
first
state,
page
18,
that
in
fact
traditionally
they've
looked
at
hydrological
connection.
second,
they--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--traditionally.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
from
the
inception
of
the
rules.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
inception
of
the
rules,
that
they
have
looked
at
hydrological
connection.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
no.
they
state
that
that
is
the...
the
beginning
point.
the
beginning
point.
they
then
state
that
they
have
historically
undertook
a
interrelationship
analysis
of
the
wetland
to
the
tributary
or
body
of
water
and
that
they
then
defer
that
to
the
permit
review.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
we're...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--mr.
chief
justice,
in...
in
response
to
that
question,
both
potentially.
in
this
case,
again,
there
was
no
surface
water
connection,
and
due
to
the
nature
of
the
clay
soils,
it
was
found
that
there
was
no
groundwater
connection--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--after
the
improvement,
there
could
be
drainage.
ironically
the
respondent
in
this
case
actually
recommends
that
the
barriers
between
this
site
and
the
ditch
be
removed.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
it
was
found
that
there
was
not
a
connection.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
if
you...
referring
the
court
to
the
respondents'
report
dated
may
5th
of
2000,
it
specifically
states--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--this
is
from
appendix
page
81
and
83.
this
is
a
report
that
starts
with
the
term
jurisdictional
at
the
top.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
it
notes
a
number
of
issues
or
classifications
there
or
points.
first,
that
the
wetland
is
not
adjacent
to
navigable
water.
it
then
notes
the
wetland
is
not
adjacent
to
headwater.
and
then
it
makes
a
comment.
it
says,
to
a
tributary
to
navigable
water,
and
it
says,
no.
the
sole
basis
for
jurisdiction
in
that
report
is
the
migratory
bird
rule.
the
respondent
took
out
to
the
property
who
they
believed
to
be
the
most
credible
expert
they
had
on
migratory
birds
and
then
state
that
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--they
do
not
reference
a...
i'm...
this--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--right.
they
do...
they
do
not.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
yes,
they
make
that
in
a
subsequent
report.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
not...
not
in
this
first
report.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
yes.
the
next
report
is
issued
september
11th
of
2000.
in
that
report--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--i'm
going
to
refer
you
to
the
specific
pages.
they
first
referenced
clay
soils
on
page
93.
these
are
the
same
clay
soils
that
the
state
administrative
law
judge,
after
much
hearing
on
the
record,
found
were
impermeable
to
prevent
groundwater
and
surface
water
discharge.
then
at
page
97
of
the
appendix,
the
respondent
finds
that
due
to
site
conditions...
i
will
quote...
this
wetland
has
been
obstructed
from
receiving
runoff
from
surrounding
area
and
from
circulation
by
flooding
into
the
drain.
end
of
quote.
then
referring
to
page
99
of
the
same
appendix,
i
quote.
the
parcel
is
not
currently
a
part
of
the
s-o
drain
watershed,
being
the
sutherland-oemig
watershed.
then
referring
to
page
100
where
they
comment
on
navigation,
they
state,
no
impact
on
navigation.
and
then
finally
at
page
106
of
the
appendix,
the
features
on
this
site...
and
again
i
quote...
presently
isolate
the
wetland
from
the
s-o
drain
and
receiving
waters.
so
it
receives
none
and
it
gives
none.
they
used
the
term
in
their
report
isolated.
there
is
no
finding
anywhere
to
the
contrary
in
any
reports
issued,
or
thereafter
at
the
public
hearing
that
was
conducted
by
the
respondent,
that
there
is
any
connection.
in
fact,
the
sixth
circuit
noted
there
was
no
connection.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
the...
the
sole
reason
claimed
for
jurisdiction
at
the
agency
hearing
was
adjacency
to
this
non-navigable,
unnamed
ditch,
which
was
dug
by
the
county
for
a
sewer
system.
that's
the
sole
reason.
the
same
argument
appeared
at
the
district
court
level,
adjacency
to
the
unnamed,
unnavigable
ditch.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
the...
it...
it
could
occur
in
two
different
ways.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
they...
that...
that
was
not
their
finding
because
in
this
case
they
actually
recommended,
whether
or
not
anything
occurred
on
the
property,
that
the
berms
or
barriers
be
removed.
they
actually
recommend
there
be
an
interaction
between
the
wetland
and
the
ditch.
that's
the
irony
of
this.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
it...
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
no
because
the
ditch
next
to
the
site
has
not
been
regulated
under
the
rules
adopted
by
the
respondent
and...
nor
under
the
statute
adopted
by
congress.
the
ditch
is...
has
been
historically
designated
as
a
point
source
or
a
source
point,
as
has
been
the
drain
under
the
statute.
in
1975,
after
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
respondent's
rules
were
too
narrow
from
a
jurisdictional
standpoint,
the
respondent
then
expanded
its
rules
in
1975.
in
the
preamble
to
those
rules,
it
specifically
stated
that
ditches...
ditches
of
this
nature,
drainage
ditches,
were
specifically
exempted
as
waters
of
the
united
states.
that
is
in
the
preamble.
we
then
go
to--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--our...
our
test
for
significant
nexus
would
start
with
the...
the
basis
that
there
must
be
an
established,
existing
hydrological
connection
between
the
wetland
and
the
body
of
water
adjacent--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
based--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--no.
[laughter]
using
this
court's
definition
in...
in
swancc,
it's...
it
is
our
position
that
it
needs
to
be
a
substantial
nexus
or
interrelationship.
we're
saying--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--that
is
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
we're--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--we
don't...
we
do
not
believe
that
this
case
needs
to
reach
that--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--at
that
point,
then
maybe
the
respondent
could
determine
there
would
be
some
form
of
regulation
if,
in
fact,
the
discharge
was
into
a
ditch
that
was,
in
fact,
regulated.
and--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--the
test
is
from
the
outset,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
yes.
no.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
the...
the
resulting
impact...
i
would
say
no.
the
resulting
impact
has
not
been
determined
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
the
application
for
the
permit
does
not
automatically
equate
to
a
request
to
discharge.
the
fill
of
a
wetland
does
not
automatically
discharge
into
the
ditch.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
this
court's
test
in
swancc
is
based
upon
the
before,
and
also
based
upon
riverside,
it
examined
the
before
condition
and
the
impact
on
that
navigable
water.
and
what
is
to
be
prevented
is
the
discharge
into
that
navigable
water.
and
that
is
the
initial
test
that
is
conducted.
if
the
court
examines
the
respondent's
actual
test
data,
what
they
examined
here
was
the
jurisdictional
determination
from
the
beginning.
is
there
a
connection?
is
it
isolated?
is
it
not
isolated?
they
didn't
look
at
the
after-effect.
they
looked
at
the
after-effect
in
relationship
to
issuing
or
not
issuing
the
permit.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
that
is
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
that
is
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
under
the
court's
definition
in
swancc
and
riverside,
the
answer
again
is
no.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
it
did
not
do
so,
your
honor,
because
specifically
under
section
1251(b),
it
reserved
to
the
states
the
primary
responsibility
of
regulating
pollution
within
its
waters.
the
primary
responsibility.
their
primary
responsibility
is
not
designated
to
the
respondent
in
this
case.
a
shift
would...
in...
in
that
framework
would
shift
the
primary
responsibility
to
the
respondent
and
take
that
primary
responsibility
away
from
the
state.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
in
this
case,
it
actually...
the
decision
of
the
respondent
did
displace
the
state.
the
state,
after
years
of
examination
and
determination
of
impact,
made
a
decision
to
issue
a
wetland
permit
to
this
project
and,
in
doing
so,
found
specifically
that
the
issuance
of
the
permit
would
be
better,
effective
method
of
dealing
with
pollution
than
not
issuing
the
permit.
that
was
the
specific
finding
made
by
the
administrative
law
judge
in
that
appendix,
and
those
findings
are
the
first
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
case,
detailed
findings
after
a
2-week
administrative
trial
where
witnesses
were
cross-examined
and
examined.
in
this
case,
the
respondent
has
ignored
those
state
powers
given
to
its
traditional
waters
and
has
said,
we're
going
to
ignore,
number
one,
your
claim
of
jurisdiction,
and
number
two,
we're
going
to
ignore
your
finding
of
no
impact
and
completely
disregard
that.
so,
in
fact,
the
framework
in
this
case
did
shift.
the
state
did
what
it
was
supposed
to
do
under
1251(b)
and
the...
the
respondent
in
this
case
usurped
that
responsibility
and
those
traditional
powers
granted
to
it
traditionally
and
both
by
this
statute,
and
then
determined
that
what
the
state
of
michigan
did
had
no
relevance.
it
was
unwarranted.
so
the
framework
in
this
case
did
specifically
change.
and
in
doing
so,
we
get
back
to
those
same
factual
findings
they've
made.
we
are
here
only
today
because
they
found
that
it
is
adjacent
to
a
ditch
which
they
have
said
is
not
a
waters
of
the
united
states.
so
in
this
case,
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--that's
correct,
because
there's
some
puddles
on
the
land
occasionally.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
to...
to
be
waters
of
the
united
states,
they
would
have
to
have
a
hydrological
connection
as
a
minimum
test
to
be
a
part
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
that
is
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
no.
the...
that
is
correct.
the
permit
permits
the
discharge
into
a
navigable
water
of
the
united
states.
that
is
the
object
of
the
permit.
again,
the
rules
that
the
respondent
has
adopted
since
1975
have
specifically
excluded
the
nundane
ditch,
as
well
as
the
drain
next
to
that
ditch,
as
being
defined
as
waters
of
the
united
states.
so
therefore,
even
if
they
could
show
a
connection,
which
is
a
question
that
has
been
raised,
would
in
fact
the
wetland
be
regulated,
by
the...
by
the
respondents'
own
definitions
and
by
the
statutory
definition
which
excludes
a
ditch
and
a
drain
under
section
1262(12)
and
(14),
neither
the
ditch
or
the
sutherland-oemig
drain
by
definition
is
a
water
of
the
united
states.
it
is
a
point
source
and
therefore
not
a
water.
so
even
if
they
could--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--in
this
case,
there
are
two
things.
the
first,
the
berm
segregates
the
surface
water
connection
between
the
two,
and
then
second,
the
nature
of
the
soils
being
clay,
which
are
not
permeable
soils,
create
the
additional
segregation
between
that
and
the
body
of
water.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
it
would
break
the
hydrological
connection.
however,
this
court
has
ruled
in
the
riverside
case
that
those
wetlands
which
are
adjacent
to
navigable
waters...
it
did
not
reach
the
issue
whether
they
were
not
adjacent
to
non-navigable
waters.
they
only
addressed
the...
this
court
only
addressed
the
issue
of
relationship
to
navigable
waters.
in
that
case,
this
court
specifically
found
that
wetlands
adjacent
to
navigable
waters
were
regulated.
the
court
specifically
reserved
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
--in
reading
the
opinion...
your
honor,
my
time
is
up.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
yes.
in
reading
the
opinion,
it...
it
appears
that
this
court
found,
because
it
actually
went
to
the
water's
edge,
there
was
an
inseparable,
bound-up
attachment
between
the
wetland
and
the
navigable
water.
mr.
timothy
a.
stoepker
thank
you.
