mr.
m.
reed

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
agency
overreaching.
in
this
case,
the
corps
and
epa
pushed
the
very
limits
of
congressional
authority,
contrary
to
the
plain
text
of
the
act
and
without
any
clear
indication
congress
intended
that
result.
they
claim
404(a)
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
tributary
system,
from
the
smallest
[*2]
trickle
to
the
largest
watershed,
swapping
in
--
sweeping
in
remote,
non-navigable
wetlands
20
miles
from
the
traditional
navigable
water.
this
limitless
claim
of
jurisdiction
shifts
the
federal/state
balance
and
raises
significant
constitutional
questions.
we
believe
this
boundless
interpretation
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
reading
of
the
act
in
solid
waste
agency.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
yes,
your
honor.
they
actually
argued
that
it...
it
makes
no
difference
whether
there...
what
the
substantiality
is
or
the
directness
of
the
connection
is.
it's
irrelevant
to
the
jurisdictional
determination.
and
as
i
said,
they...
the...
the
agencies
assert
jurisdiction
over
even
the
entire
watershed.
for
example,
the
mississippi
watershed,
the
largest
in
the
nation,
covers
1
million
square
acre...
1
million
square
miles
and
reaches
from
the
rockies
to
the
appalachians
and
drains
41
percent
of
the
48
lower
states.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
i'd
put
the
line
where
congress
put
the
line,
your
honor.
congress
declared
in
404(a)
that
it
would
prohibit
the
discharge
of
fill
and
dredged
material
into
the
navigable
waters.
so
the...
these
agencies
can
permit
or
prohibit
any
discharge,
no
matter
where
it
occurs,
so
long
as
it
reaches
a
navigable
water.
that
would
be
the--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--yes.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
yes.
traditional
navigable
waters
plus
abutting
wetlands
inseparably
bound
up.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
congress
cannot
regulate
all
tributaries.
it
could
regulate
some
tributaries--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--but
would
have
to
do
so
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
the
regulation
of
all
tributaries
raises
significant
constitutional
questions
and
contrary
to
the
regulation
of...
of
wetlands
that
are
inseparably
bound
up.
and
there's
no
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
to
regulate
any
tributaries,
let
alone
the
entire
tributary
system.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
the...
the
act,
by
its
terms,
does
not
recognize
the...
the
regulation
of
any
tributary.
it
does--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--i
think...
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
under
this
court's
determination
in
solid
waste
agency
that
the
only
wetlands
that
are
covered
are
those
that
are
abutting
and
inseparably
bound
up.
it
makes
sense
to
do
so
because
by
regulating
those
types
of
wetlands,
the
government
is
essentially
declaring
them
the
equivalent
of
the
navigable
waterway.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
the
reason
that
logic
does
not
apply,
your
honor,
is
because
the
regulation
of...
of
tributaries
raises
significant
constitutional
questions
that
are
not
implicated
by
the
regulation
of
a
wetland
inseparably--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--that's
incorrect,
your
honor.
we
acknowledge
that
under
the...
the
act,
the
government
can
regulate
any
discharge
that
actually
reaches
the
navigable
water.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
no.
either...
in
either
case,
if...
if
the...
if
the
discharge
of
dredged
material
actually
enters
into
a
navigable
water,
regardless
of
where
it's
discharged,
it
would
be
covered.
same
for
a
conventional
toxin.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
the...
the...
certainly
congress
did
not
think
so
in
section--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--well,
it
certainly
wasn't
true
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
absolutely.
that's...
that's
what
the
terms
of
the
act
require.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
well,
the...
that's
one
of
the
problems
here,
your
honor,
is
that...
is
that
the
agency
has...
has
established
a
moving
target
for...
for
tributaries.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
well,
the...
the
definitions
we're
working
with
here,
to
which
we
object,
is
that...
is
that
it
includes
anything
in
the
hydrological
connection.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
well,
we're
suggesting
that...
that
this
court
need
not
define
tributary
because
under
the
act
all
tributaries
are
excluded.
the
only...
the
only
prohibited
act--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--those...
anything
that
is
not
of
a...
anything
does
not
constitute
the
channel,
the
traditional
navigable
water,
and
anything
not
abutting
as
a...
as
a
inseparably
bound
up
wetland
would
constitute
a
tributary.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
yes.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
well,
this
court
did
not--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--this
court
did
not
suggest
in...
in
swancc
that
a
significant
nexus
constitutes
the
jurisdictional
standard
for
all...
for
all
waters.
that
standard
only
applies
to
wetlands
that
are
adjacent
to
traditional
navigable
waters.
the
jurisdictional
standard
is
determined
by
the
terms
of
the
act.
in...
in
swancc,
this
court
determined
that
the
act
was
clear
and
should
be
read
as
written
to
avoid
the
constitutional
questions
raised
by
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
act.
as
written--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--it
makes
perfect
sense,
your
honor,
because
the
regulation
of
those
tributaries
and
streams,
all
of
them
in
the
entire
tributary
system,
raise
significant
constitutional
questions
that
are
not
implicated
by
regulating
wetlands
that
are
inseparably
bound
up
with
traditional
navigable
water.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
that's
right.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
the
court
did
frame
the
question
that
way,
your
honor.
however,
the
court's
commentary
about
tributaries
was
not
germane
to
its...
to
its
holding.
tributaries
was
not
a
question
before
the
court.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
well,
as
i
said,
the...
the
court's
commentary
in
riverside
bayview
is
not
good
law
because
the...
the
court
was
not
addressing
the...
a
tributary's
question
in
that
case,
and
it
was
not
faced
with
a
commerce
clause
challenge
as
it
is
in
this
case.
and
at
that
time,
the
agency
did
not
interpret
tributaries
to
include
every
hydrological
reach
of
the...
of
the
tributary
system.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the...
the
problem
that...
that
the
agencies
have
in
this
case,
which
was
underscored
in
solid
waste
agency,
is
that
the
government
cannot
show
any
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
to
regulate
the
entire
tributary
system.
in
solid
waste
agency,
this
court
did
recognize
that
because
of
congressional
acquiescence,
congress
intended
to
regulate
wetlands
adjacent
to
navigable
waters,
but
as
to
other
waters,
this
court
could
come
to
no
conclusion
because
the
congress
had
never
defined
other
waters.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
to
believe
that
at
all,
your
honor.
we
simply
look
at...
at
the
goals
and
objectives
that
congress
itself
adopted
in
furtherance
of
this
mission
to
protect
the
waters.
if
we
look
at
1251(a),
congress
declares
that
its
purpose
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
nation's
waters.
it
used
that
term,
nation's
waters.
and
then
in...
in
1251(a)(1),
it
says
it
will
accomplish
this
by
eliminating
the
discharge
of
pollutants
into
the
navigable
waters,
showing
that
it
knows
how
to
distinguish
between
all
waters
and
navigable
waters.
and
then
in
1251(b),
congress
says
we
will
respect
and
defer
to
the
states'
primary
responsibility
to
address
local
water
pollution
and
to
manage
local
land
and
water
use.
so
the
way
that
congress
intended
to
address
this
issue
as
to
defer
to
the
states
to
regulate
pollutants
upstream
while
congress...
or
while
the
federal
government
regulates
downstream.
that's
a
perfectly
rational
approach
to
this
national
problem.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
are
covered
if
they
make
it...
their
way
all
the
way
there.
if
they
don't,
then
the
states
have
that
responsibility.
and
every
state
in
the
nation
has
antipollution
regulation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
i'd
be
happy
to.
in...
in
solid
waste
agency,
this
court
looked
at
404(g)
and
determined
that
it
had...
it
was
not
enlightening
as
to
the
meaning
of
navigable
waters
under
404(a)
because
congress
did
not
define
other
waters
in
any
way.
and
this
court
likewise
concluded
that
404(g)
was
simply
not
before
it
and
would
not
draw
any
conclusions
from
it.
so
i
submit
that
it
is
really
irrelevant.
i
note...
i
want
to
draw
this
court's
attention
to
our
footnote
1
in
our
reply
where
we
point
out
that...
that
in
every
formal
rulemaking,
the
corps
and
the
epa
have
excluded
drainage
ditches
from
the
definition
of
tributary.
it
is
here
and
now
that
these
agencies
are
redefining
the
term
tributary
to
include
anything
in
the
hydrological
chain.
the
sixth
circuit
decision
says
that
any
hydrological
connection
suffices
as
a
significant
nexus
to
bring
in
wetlands
under
federal
jurisdiction.
of
course,
in...
in
page
31
of
the
opposition,
the
government
argues
that
neither
the
directness...
excuse
me...
nor
the
substantiality
of
a
tributary's
connection
to
traditional
navigable
waters
is
relevant
to
the
jurisdictional
inquiry.
it's
simply
not
true
that
the
government
is
only
identifying
channelized
conduits
as
tributaries.
anywhere
water
flows
is
a
tributary
in
their
book.
let
me
also
address
something
that
this
court
did
in
swancc.
it
was
not
the
lack
of
a
hydrological
connection
in
that
case
that
informed
this
court's
decision
to
exclude
those
isolated
ponds
from
federal
jurisdiction.
it
was
the
fact
that
those...
that
the
regulation
of
those
isolated
ponds
did
not
meet
the
terms
of
the
act
and
there
was
no
clear
indication
congress
intended
to
regulate
isolated
ponds.
i
submit
that's
this
case.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
to
regulate
wetlands
20
miles
from
the
nearest
navigable
water.
the--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--the...
the
record
is
silent
as
to
the
distance
between--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--we
don't
know
how
far
that
is
because
the
record
is
silent
as
to
the
distance
between
those
water
bodies.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
i
don't
know
what
he
means
by
very
close.
the...
the
solicitor
general
would
agree
with
me
that...
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
those
distances
are.
and
it's
irrelevant
in...
in
our
opinion
whether
it's...
whether
it's
a
mile
or
20
miles
or
50
miles
or
100
miles,
and
that's
the
point.
there
does...
under
the...
under
the
federal
regulations
a
true,
significant
nexus
is
not
required,
just
any
hydrological
connection.
this
is
a
presumption
on
congressional
authority.
this
expansive
interpretation
destroys
any
distinction
between
what
is
national
and
what
is
local
under...
as...
as
has
already
been
pointed
out.
under
the
federal
regulations,
you
can't
dig
a
ditch
in
this
country
without
federal
approval.
you
can't
fill
it
in.
you
can't
clean
it
out
without
federal
approval.
this
reads
the
term
navigable
right
out
of
the
statute.
we...
we
ask
this
court
not
to
allow
these
agencies--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--congress...
congress
considered
all
this
when
it
made
its
policy
decision
to
defer
to
the
states
to
address
this.
the
states
have
the
ability
and
the
will
to...
to
protect
their
own
waters
from
pollutants
of
any
kind.
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
all
the
states
have
antipollution
regulations.
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
my
time
is--
mr.
m.
reed
hopper
--congress
determined
that
it
would
defer
to
the
states
instead
of
exercising
any
further
power
beyond
its
channels
authority.
