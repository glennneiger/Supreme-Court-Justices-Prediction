mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
united
states
against
riverside
bayview
homes,
this
court
unanimously
upheld
the
corps'
jurisdiction
over
wetlands
that
were
not
themselves
navigable,
but
were
adjacent
to
waters
otherwise
within
the
corps'
jurisdiction.
the
principal
difference
between
the
rapanos
wetlands
and
the
wetlands
at
issue
in
riverside
bayview
are
that
the
rapanos
wetlands
are
adjacent
to
a
non-navigable
tributary,
while
the
wetlands
at
issue
in
riverside
bayview
were
adjacent
to
a
navigable
creek.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
not
in
all
these
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
not...
not...
that's
actually
not
true.
there
are
three
specific
wetlands
that
are
at
issue
in
the
rapanos
case.
one
of
those,
the
pine
river
site,
as
its
name
suggests,
is
adjacent
to
the
pine
river,
which
is
a
body
of
water
that
has
water
flowing
through
it
all
year-round.
it's
a
river.
i
don't
think
anybody
would
look
at
that
and
say
that's
not
a
tributary
of
the
downstream
navigable
rivers.
and
i
think
that's
why,
in
fairness--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the...
the
other
sites
are...
are
adjacent
to
man-made
ditches
that
also
drain
in.
if
i
just...
can
i
just
say,
though,
i
think
the
fact
that
the
pine
river
site
is
so
obviously
a
tributary
under...
under
any
definition
is
one
of
the
reasons,
along
with
the
theory
that
you
heard
advanced
by
petitioners,
that
this
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
want
to
make
the
point
that
this
case,
because
of
the
theory
petitioners
have
advanced,
has
not
really
unearthed
or
focused
on
the
definition
of
a
tributary,
but
let
me
get
to
it
because
the
corps
has
defined
the
definition
of
a
tributary.
and
the
definition
of
a
tributary
is
basically
any
channelized
body
of
water
that
takes
water
in
a
flow
down
to
the
traditional
navigable
water--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--even--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
scalia,
absolutely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
corps
has
not
drawn
a
distinction
between
man-made
channels
or
ditches
and
natural
channels
or
ditches.
and,
of
course,
it
would
be
very
absurd
for
the
corps
to
do
that
since
the
erie
canal
is
a
ditch.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
let
me
say
two
things,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
this
case
has
not
been
litigated
under
the
theory
that
the
key
difference
is
whether
it's
man-made
or
natural,
and
that
defines
somehow
the
scope
of
a
tributary.
and
i
think
there's
a
good
reason
for
that,
which
is
the
second
point,
which
is
as
the
corps
experts...
from
the
experts,
the
corps
will
tell
you
the
process
of
making
the
natural
rivers
navigable
has
all
been
about
the
process
of
channelizing
them
and
creating
man-made,
artificial
channels
in
them
to
the
point
where
the
difference
between
that
which
is
a
man-made
channel
and
that
which
is
a
natural
channel
is
both
difficult
to
discern
and
utterly
beside
the
point
for
purposes
of
this
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
the
precise
answer
to
your
question
being
none
of
the
land
mass...
none
of
the
land
itself
would
be
regulated.
but
in
terms
of...
you
want
to
talk
about
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
the...
the
corps
doesn't.
they
treat
those
as
water
bodies.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
that's
not
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
here.
but
just
to
be
responsive
to
your
question,
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
corps
and
the
epa's
view
of
wetlands
would
cover
about
80
percent
of
the
wetlands
in
the
country.
and
that
shows
that
the
impact
of
this
court's
decision
in
swancc
was
real
and
substantial
because
about
20
percent
of
the
nation's
wetlands
are
isolated.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
the
corps
has
regulated
this
channelized
tributary
system.
it
has
done
it
without
regard
to
whether
those
channels
are
seasonally
dry
in
some
areas,
and
i
think
that's
a
rational
judgment.
it's
not
been
the
gravamen
of
this
case,
though.
and
what's
important
is
while
the
corps
and
the
federal
government
regulate
that
channelized
system
of
tributaries,
non-point
source
pollution
is
still
something
that's
in
the
primary
providence
of
the
states.
and
so
it's
not
true
that
the
corps
is
asserting
an
authority
to
regulate
land
as
such.
but
to
also
get
it
on
the
table,
if
the
federal
government
wanted
to...
if
congress
changed
its
mind
and
said
that,
say,
the
banks
of
the
navigable
rivers
or
their
tributaries
are
within
the
scope
of
this
program,
as
it
did
in
1899
in
section
13
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
we'd
be
here
defending
that
as
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
authority
not
just
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
under
the
navigation
power
of
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
in
1899
in
section
13
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
the
so-called
refuse
act,
congress
regulated
the
navigable
waters
and
their
tributaries.
now,
in
fairness,
the
focus
there
was
this
idea
that
they
only
regulated
the
tributaries
if
they
could
show
that
it
flowed
into
the
navigable
waters
themselves,
but
they
asserted
right
in
the
text
of
the
statute
in
1899
the
authority
to
regulate
the
tributaries
and
the
banks.
and
that
shows
what
i
think
is
a
very
important
difference
between
this
case
and
swancc.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
kennedy,
that's
not
precisely
accurate.
the
way
it
would
describe
it
is
this.
as
to
the
first
question
you
have
to
ask,
which
is
are
the
tributaries
covered,
we
think
an
important
component
of
describing
the
reach
of
the
tributary
system
is
whether
there's
a
hydrological
connection.
on
the
second...
and
that's
subsection
5
of
the
regulatory
definition
that
brings
within
the
scope
of
waters
of
the
united
states
tributaries.
then
you
get
to
the
second
question
which
actually
implicates
another
subsection
of
the
definition,
subsection
(7),
which
is
the
adjacent
wetlands.
and
as
to
the
adjacent
wetlands,
as
the
carabell
case
illustrates,
the
definition
does
not
turn
on
hydrological
connection
for
purposes
of
asserting
the
corps'
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
they...
they
were
included
for
the
likelihood
of
an
interaction
both
hydrologically
and
otherwise.
i
would
say
two
important
things,
though.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
two
points
i
would
make
is,
first
of
all,
i
think
the
corps'
regulations,
which
for
30
years
have
ignored
the
premise...
the...
the
presence
of
a
berm,
are
rational
because
in
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
cases,
that
berm
is
not
going
to
prevent
a
hydrological
connection,
so
to
speak.
and
so
a
test
that
focuses,
first
and
foremost,
on
physical
proximity
is
a
very
rational
jurisdictional
test.
the
second
thing
i
would
say,
though,
is
it's
simply
not
true
that
even
in
the
rare
case
where
a
berm
or
a
dike
prevents
all
hydrological
connection,
that
an
adjacent
wetland
will
not
perform
an
important
function
for
the
adjacent
water
body.
and
the
most
obvious
one
is
the
flood
control
possibility
of
the
wetland.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i...
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
my
own
view
is
the
reason
that
that
caveat
is
in
subsection
(7)
is
actually
a
vestige
of
the
pre-swancc
scope
of
the
regulation.
and
specifically,
if
you
look
at
subsection
(3)
of
the
definition
which
is
the
isolated
waters
provision
that
was
at
issue,
i
think,
through
the
migratory
bird
rule
in
swancc,
that
includes
wetlands
in
the
available
isolated
waters.
and
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
several
thoughts
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
problem
with
that
approach
is
that
the
reason
why
it
makes
sense
to
regulate
that
very
first
tributary
that
flows
into
the
mississippi
is
the
reason
that
it
makes
sense
to
regulate
the
entire
tributary
system.
all
of
that
water
is
going
to
flow
down
into
the
navigable
waters,
and
if
there's
going
to
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
way
that
i
would
read
that
and
the
way
i
understand
the
corps
reads
that
is
that
was
really
just
trying
to
exclude
a
wetland
adjacent
to
a
wetland
that
was
a
water
of
the
united
states
only
because
of
the
application
of
subsection
(3).
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
think
that's...
that's
supported
by
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
agree
with
that,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
and
i...
i
guess
there
are
two
ways
to
look
at
this.
you
can
start
with
the
significant
nexus
test
and
see
if
it's
met.
i
guess
the
way
that
the
corps
would
naturally
proceed
is
to
start
with
their
definitions,
and
they
would
say
section...
subsection
(5)
covers
tributaries.
and
you
can
ask
the
question,
is
there
a
significant
nexus
between
the
tributaries
and
the
navigable
waters
in
which
they
flow
into?
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
and
then
there's
the
secondary
question,
as
to
subsection
(7)
of
the
regulatory
definition.
is
there
a
significant
nexus
between
wetlands
that
are
adjacent
to
waters
otherwise
within
the
corps'
jurisdiction,
be
they
the
traditional
navigable
waters
or
their
tributaries?
and
i
think
riverside
bayview
answered
that
question
and
said,
yes,
there
is
a
significant
nexus
between
adjacent
wetlands
and
any
otherwise
regulable
water
body
to
which
they
are
adjacent.
so
that's
the
way
we
would
ultimately
satisfy
what
this
court
required,
which
is
a
significant
nexus.
i
wouldn't
have
understood
this
court's
decision
to
transplant
the
significant
nexus
test
and
say,
that's
what
the
corps
should
administer,
because
whatever
ambiguity
there
is
in
waters
of
the
united
states,
i
think
significant
nexus
is
precisely
the
kind
of
test
you'd
want
the
corps--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i...
i
think
that...
as
i
said,
i
think
what...
what
the
definition
meant
to
get
at
was
to
exclude
wetlands
adjacent
to
isolated
wetlands
under
subsection
(3).
i
think
if
you
ask
the
question
more
broadly,
what
about
wetlands
next
to
wetlands,
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
that
because
the
one
thing
we
know
from
riverside
bayview
is
that
it's
not
a
requirement
that
the
parcel
and
its
wetlands
be
immediately
adjacent.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they
meant
wetlands
adjacent
to
waters
that
would
otherwise
not
be
in
the
statute
which
are
isolated
wetlands
under
subsection
(3).
it's
the
only
application
it
has
in...
in
the
regulatory
structure,
as
they
understand
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
under
insignificant
nexus?
well,
i
think
it's
the
waters
at
issue
in
swancc,
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
no--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
leaving
out
everything
that
this
court
excluded
in
swancc,
and
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that
the...
that
the
court
necessarily
suggested
there
was
going
to
be
some
subset
that
had
a
further
insignificant
nexus
because
it
wasn't...
the
argument
of
the
government
in
those
cases
was
obviously...
we
didn't
just
concede
that
those
bodies
of
water
were
utterly
isolated.
we
said
they
did
have
important
ecological
connections
with
the
water.
and
i
think
the
way
i
read
swancc
is
that
we
can't
make
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what
i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
if
the
tributary
flows
in.
i
would
start
with
the
tributary,
and
i'd
say,
now,
there's
clearly
a
significant
nexus
between
the
tributary
and
the
navigable
waters
to
which
it
flows.
i
would
then
look
at
the
wetland,
and
i
would
say
for
purposes
of
the
regulation
of
adjacent
wetlands--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--for
purposes
of
the
adjacent
wetlands,
it
doesn't
look
to
hydrological
connection
per
se.
the
way
i
would
resolve
that
is
i
would
resolve
it
with
reference
to
footnote
9
in
this
court's
opinion
in
riverside
bayview,
and
i
would
say,
all
right,
one
drop?
fair
enough.
it's
in
the
regulatory
jurisdiction
because
it's
adjacent
and
that's
what
the
corps
looks
to.
and
i
think
that's
a
rational
judgment.
but
if
there's
one
drop,
grant
the
permit.
that
solves
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--adjacent
to
a
tributary,
absolutely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
if
you
had
in
mind
a
tributary,
you'd
probably
have
in
mind
the
pine
river
which
is
at
issue
in
one
of
these
sites.
and
i
think
that's
why
that's
not
the
way
petitioners
have
presented
this
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
some
things
that
you
might
classify
as
a
storm
drain
are
actually
very
deep
channels
that
have
a
continuous
flow
of
water
that
were--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
[laughter]
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
therein
is
the
problem,
which
is
some
things
that
are
part
of
the
storm
water
drainage
system
of
a
city
are
actually
things
that
were
previous
navigable
natural
waters.
i
mean,
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--we
would,
justice
scalia,
but
i
guess
if
we
can
start
with
the
proposition
that
tributaries
are
covered
and
then
some
things
that
the
corps
thinks
are
tributaries
you
disagree
with,
that
would
be
fine.
but
that
would
be
a
different
case.
that
hasn't
been
the
theory
that
this
case
has
been
presented.
as
i
understand,
these
drains
here
are
actually,
you
know,
substantial
channels
that
do
have
water
in
them.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
pine
river
meets
the
test
that
it
sounds
like
you
would
have
for
a
tributary,
and
the
difficulty
i'm
having
is
i'd
be
happy
to
defend
what
the
corps
did
if
this
court,
in
the...
in
the
litigation
of
this
case,
had
focused
the
court's
and
the
corps'
attention
on
that
issue.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right.
it's
an
undefined
term.
the
corps
has
interpreted
it
in
the
2000
preamble.
the
best
place
to
find
the
corps'
teaching
on
this
is
65
fed.
reg.
12,823-4.
and
they
go
through...
it
was
part
of
a
comment
and
they
deal
with
comments
about
their
treatment
of
ditches
and
the
like
and
many
of
these
issues.
and
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is
i
think
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
i
mean,
you
heard
the
petitioners'
argument.
they
have
obviously,
based
on
the
legal
position
they've
advanced,
not
focused
this
court
or
any
other
court's
attention
on
subdividing
which
tributaries
count
because
their
view
is
nothing
counts.
even
the
first
tributary
doesn't
count.
and
i
think
in
this
case
what
i
would
urge
you
to
do,
if...
if
you
have
some
concern
with,
you
know,
the
extent
of
the
definition
of
tributary,
is
to
not
make
that
a
basis
for
invalidating
this...
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
here.
and
that's
an
issue
that
could
be
developed
in
other
cases
if...
if
the
parties
want
to
really
focus
the
attention
on
that.
i
think
i
would
be
comfortable
defending
the
corps'
judgment,
even
in
those
more
finely
focused
challenges,
because
i
get
back
to
the
point,
which
is
that
the
same
logic
that
has
you
regulate
that
first
tributary
also
suggests
that
you
want
to
regulate
anything
that's
a
channel
that
brings
large
quantities
of
water
into
the
navigable
waterways.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
absolutely
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
why
i'm
not
up
here
asking
for
federal
regulation
over
non-point
source
pollution,
although
that
obviously
contributes
to
the...
to
the
problem.
what
i'm
up
here
asking
for
is
a
recognition
that
the
tributary
system
is
something
that
congress
can
validly
regulate
and
did
regulate
in
its
broader
definition
of
waters
of
the
united
states
in
the
clean
water
act.
and
i
think
that's
something...
the
authority
to
regulate
tributaries
is
something
congress
regulated
starting
in
1899
and,
importantly,
this
court
expressly
upheld
in
1941
in
oklahoma
against
atkinson.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
one
important
thing
to
focus
on,
justice
scalia,
is
this
case
is
not
just
about
the
corps'
404
program
because
the
404
program
by
its
terms
does
not
permit
anything.
as...
as
the
permit
word
suggests,
it's
a...
it's
a
process
of
granting
permission.
the
relevant
provision
here
is
section
301
of
the
statute
which
prohibits
a
discharge
into
the
navigable
waters
without
a
permit.
and
so
whatever
this
court
decides
for
purposes
of
the
404
jurisdiction,
it's
necessarily
deciding
for
purposes
of
the
402
jurisdiction
of
the
epa.
and
so
what
you'd
be
suggesting
is
that
if
some
tributaries
aren't
covered,
then
it's
perfectly
okay
to
dump
toxins
in
those
tributaries
even
though
you
know
that
because
they
are
a
channelized
system
that
directly
connects
with
the
navigable
water--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
there's
only
two
ways
to
do
that.
one
way
of
doing
that
and
the
one
that
i
hear
them
advocating
would
be
this
impossible
sort
of
process
of
trying
to
fingerprint
or
dna
test
oil
spills
in
a
tributary
to
figure
out,
yes,
that's
the
guy
that
got
it
to
the
navigable
waters.
and
the
one
thing
we
know
is
that
there
were
some
efforts
to
try
to
regulate
pollution
that
way
before
1972
and
they
were
a
dismal
failure.
the
only
other
way
to
do
it,
as
suggested
by
one
or
two
amici,
is
to
treat
the
last...
treat
the
tributary
as
if
it
were
a
point
source.
but
i'd
sure
hate
to
be
the
guy
who
owns
the...
the
land
next
to
that
tributary
that's
dumping
into
the
mississippi
who's
going
to
be
responsible
for
the
pollution
of
everybody
upstream.
and
what
congress
recognized
in
1972
is
that
they
had
to
regulate
beyond
traditional
navigable
waters.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
kennedy,
the
states
still
have
plenary
control
over
the
non-point
source
pollution.
they
still
have
an
important
cooperative
role
in...
in
the
overall
program,
as
you'll
hear
more
about
in
the
second
case
today.
and
i
would
actually
ask
you
to
focus
on
one
particular
provision
that
deals
with
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states
under
404
in
particular,
and
that's
section
404,
subsection
(g)
of
the
statute.
and
that
was
added
to
the
statute
in
1977.
unless
congress
is
going
to
be
construed
to
have
given
the
states
a
virtual
empty
set,
that
provision
makes
crystal
clear
that
the
waters
of
the
united
states,
for
purposes
of
the
clean
water
act,
extend
beyond
traditional
navigable
waters
and
their
adjacent
wetlands.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
i
concede
that.
but
then
you
get
to
the
question
of
defining
real
tributaries,
and
that's
neither
been
teed
up
in
this
litigation,
nor
is
it
something
that
i
think,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
you'd
want
to
differ
from
the
corps'
judgment,
which
although
you
find
it
striking
that
some
things
that
are
ditches
are
actually
included
in
the
system,
that
is
a
product
of
the
way
that
the
tributary
systems
have
worked,
the
way
that
certain
cities
have
taken
over
a
natural
stream
and
channelized
it
and
make
it
look
like
a
ditch,
but
it's
part
of
the
system
that
carries
water
down
from
the
headwaters.
and
again,
maybe
that's
an
issue
that
we
can
try
to
divine
the
limits
to
in
a
subsequent
case.
but
i
think
what's
important,
as...
as
your
very
comments
suggest,
is
that
trying
to
give
meaning
to
that
textual
indication
that
congress
had
clearly
wanted
to
capture
something
beyond
traditional
navigable
waterways
and
their
adjacent
wetlands.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
even
you
would
concede
it's
a
clear
statement
that
something
else
must
be
covered.
otherwise,
other
than
is
completely
meaningless
in
the
statute.
and
so...
and...
and
i...
i
grant
you
that
it
might
not
be
a
clear
statement
as
to
the
nth
tributary,
and
maybe
that's
a
case
on
which
we
can
litigate
in
the
future.
but
i
think
what
i
would
say
is,
for
those
of
your
colleagues
that
want
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
it
provides
some
additional
context
for
404(g)
and
makes
it
very
clear
that
congress,
as
this
court
found
in
both
riverside
bayview
and
in
swancc,
was
specifically
focused
on
the
coverage
of
adjacent
wetlands.
and
it's
very
clear
that
they
understood
that
whatever
scope
of
jurisdiction
was
given
to
the
corps,
that
it
would
bring
along
with
it
the
adjacent
wetlands.
and
so
there
was
this
long
debate.
as
i
say,
the
legislative
history
i
think
makes
it
quite
clear
that
they
were
meant
to
include
the
non-navigable
tributaries
and
a
substantial
amount
of
the
non-navigable
tributaries.
and
so,
i
mean,
i
would
invite
others
to
look
at
that.
i
also
think
that,
to
get
back
to
a
point
i
made
earlier,
one
thing
that's
exceedingly
clear
from
that
legislative
history
is
nobody
in
1977,
including
those
that
were
advocating
restricting
the
scope
of
the
404(g)
program,
wanted
to
restrict
the
epa's
jurisdiction
under
402.
and
so
in
the
legislation
that
they
proposed
that
eventually
found
form
in
404(g),
they
expressly
decoupled
the
404
permitting
process
and
its
jurisdiction
from
the
402
process.
petitioners'
argument,
by
contrast,
necessarily
restricts
the
scope
of
both
of
those
programs
because
they
are
joined
in
the
hip
through
301.
and
so
if
they're
right
that
they
can
dredge
and
fill
in
these
wetlands,
then
it
is
equally
true
that
they
can
dump
toxic
materials
into
those
wetlands.
if
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what
i
would
say,
justice
breyer...
i...
i
think
i
can
answer
the
whole
question...
is
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
as
i
understand
it,
a
berm
will
not
have
the
effect
of
actually
preventing
all
hydrological
connection.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
a
number
of
the
amicus
briefs
have
addressed
that.
i
wish
i
could
point
to
you
a
specific
one.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
again,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
a
percentage.
i
just
think
that...
that...
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way,
and
this
is
the
argument
we
obviously
make
in
the
brief.
the
best
reason
to
think
that
a
man-made...
that
a
man-made
berm
or
a
natural
berm
is
unlikely
to
prevent
all
hydrological
flow
is
even
those
man-made
structures
that
have
as
their
express
design
to
prevent
water
flow,
like
dikes
and
levees
and
dams,
have
seepage
and
leakage
from
them.
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what's
wrong
with
what
you
just
said
is
that
wetlands
have
unique
characteristics
that
are
different
just
from
low-lying
areas.
and
i
think
this
court
started
to
recognize
that
in
the
riverside
bayview
case.
and
the
image
i
would
leave
you
with
is
the
image
that
wetlands
actually
act
something
like
a
sponge,
and
because
of
that
characteristic,
they
play
two
important
roles
in
helping
to
regulate
the
flow
of
the
adjacent
water
body.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and,
again,
i
mean,
i
would
direct
you
to
the
amicus
briefs
that
discuss
in
length
the
benefits
of
wetlands,
but
i
understand
you
won't
find
those--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and...
and
i
sense
that
you
found
them
lacking
in
that
sense.
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is
there's
certainly
anecdotal
evidence
in
those
amicus
briefs
that
i
think
is
quite
striking.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
not
surprisingly,
i
would
suggest
that
you
defer
to
the
agency
in
its
exercise
of
expertise.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
you...
and
you
could
cite
to
the
proceedings
in
this
very
case
in
the
joint
appendix
because
although
they
didn't
use
the
sponge
word,
there
was
a
specific
finding
in
this
case
that
these
wetlands
played
an
important
role
in
flood
control
and
pollution
control
for
the
adjacent
streams.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that
follows
because
if
you
read
subsection
(7),
as
i
do,
as
only
excluding
those
wetlands
that
are
adjacent
to
other
isolated
wetlands,
then
regulating
those
wetlands--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and
as
i
said,
i
think
you
have
to
read
that
in
the
context
not
just
of
the
rest
of
the
regulations
but
of
this
court's
decision
in
riverside
bayview.
the
one
thing
we
know
from
riverside
bayview
is
that
it's
not
enough
to
simply
say
that
your
parcel
of
wetlands
is
not
adjacent
to
the
navigable
waterway
because
in
that
case,
as
the
court
remarked,
it...
the
parcel
ended
before
it
got
to
the
adjacent
navigable
body
of
water
and
there
was
another
wetland.
there
was
a
continuation
of
the
same
wetland.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
you'd
call
that
two
adjacent
wetlands.
i
might
as
a
common
locution.
there
might
be
some
different
way
of
referring
to
that.
but
we
know
that
the
one
wetland
was
covered
because
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
riverside
bayview.
so
i
don't
think
i
would
give
undue
weight
to
that
reading
of
it
especially
when,
if
you
read
it
as
i
do,
it
makes
perfect
sense
because
a
wetland
adjacent
to
an
otherwise
isolated
wetland
is
not
going
to
have
the
same
role
to
play
in
flood
control
in
terms
of
monitoring
the
stream
volume
as
a
wetland
adjacent
to
an
otherwise
regulable
water
body
as
you
have
at
issue
here.
and
so
i
think
that
that
regulatory
decision
that
the
corps
has
made
is
one
that's
perfectly
defensible
and
makes
sense.
and
i
think
that...
again,
i
think
one
other
point
that
i
want
to
note
that's
kind
of
specific
to
this
case
is
part
of
the
reason
why
it
makes
sense
to
regulate
a
wetland
adjacent
to
an
otherwise
regulable
water
body,
even
if
there
is
a
berm
present,
is
illustrated
by
this
case
because,
as
was
alluded
to,
the
specific
development
plan
at
issue
here...
and
this
is
clear
at
joint
appendix
pages
95
and
160...
would
sever
the
berm
and
create
the
hydrological
link
between
a
smaller,
deeper
wetland
and
the
adjacent
navigable
wetland...
waterway
system.
and
so,
i
mean,
it
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense,
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
to
have
a
regulatory
regime
where
you
have
a
regulable
wetland
after
but
not
before
a
construction
project
that
has
the
effect
of
vastly
reducing
the
size
of
the
wetland.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
that's
not
it,
justice
scalia.
what
i'm
saying
is
what
the
corps
has
always
done
for
30
years
is
said
they
are
going
to
regulate
a
physically
proximate,
adjacent
wetland
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
there's
a
berm
there.
i'm
just
making
the
subsidiary
point
that
that
makes
sense
because
the
very
construction
project
that
might
be
at
issue
might
have
the
effect
of
changing
the
degree
of
the
hydrological
connection.
i
want
to
be
very
clear,
though.
the
hydrological
connection
has
never
been
the
sine
qua
non
of
the
assertion
of
regulation
authority
over
the
adjacent
wetlands.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
short
answer
is
flood
control.
if
there
is
that
berm
that...
that
allows
the
sponge
to
soak
up
water,
either
rainwater
or
waters
from
adjacent
parcels,
although
i
think
in
this
case,
it
would
largely
be
rainwater,
that...
the
fact
that
there's
a
berm
actually
helps
in
the
flood
control.
when
you
sever
it,
it
changes
the
dynamic
quite
a
bit
because
then
it's
somewhat
less
helpful
for
flood
control--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
actually
is
earlier
in
term...
plays
a
better
role--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
the
way
i
would
do
it
is
you
start
with
the
tributary.
and
if
you'll
concede
for
purposes
of
the
illustration
or
the
argument
that
that's
a
water
of
the
united
states,
then
what
the
corps
does
as
a
jurisdictional
regulation
is
treat
the
adjacent
wetland
as
a
water
of
the
united
states
as
well.
that
makes
sense
for
two
principal
reasons.
one,
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases,
there
is
going
to
be
a
hydrological
connection.
actually
tracing
out
exactly
what
it
is
and
how
it
works
is
very
difficult
and
not
the
kind
of
thing
you'd
want
to
get
into
at
the
jurisdictional
stage,
and
that's
why
the
court
said
that
was
fine
in
footnote
9
of
riverside
bayview.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
that's
not
an
independent
basis
for
jurisdiction.
it's
simply
an
illustration
of
why
disregarding
the
berm
makes
sense.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
is
not
an
independent
basis.
it
is
part
of
the
reason
why,
though,
in
the
context
of
wetlands
in
particular,
a
focus
on
physical
proximity
and
adjacency
makes
sense
and
a
fixation
on
hydrological
connection
does
not
make
sense.
part
of
the
reason
you
can
look
at
the
record
here
and
find
differing
information
about
the
extent
of
the
hydrological
connection
is
that
is
not
a
term
that
is
relevant
for
the
regulatory
scheme.
and
the
same
thing
was
equally
true
in
riverside
bayview
itself.
in
fact,
in
riverside
bayview,
the
district
court
made
a
finding
that
the
wetland
there
was
hydrologically
isolated
from
the
adjacent
streams.
now,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
in
the
petition
at
footnote
7
in
riverside
bayview,
we
think
the
best
understanding
of
what
was
meant
there
was
that
there
was
no
overtopping
and
that
there
was
some
drainage.
but
that
just
illustrates
the
point
that
hydrological
connection
is
not
a
statutory
term.
it's
not
a
regulatory
term.
it's
a
very
loose
term
and
it's
not
a
term
the
corps
has
ever
used
in
regulating
adjacent
wetlands.
it's
important
to
stress
that
the
regulation
for
adjacent
wetlands
that
is
at
issue
here,
subsection
(7),
is
exactly
the
same
regulation
that
was
at
issue
in
riverside
bayview.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
the
court,
when
it
framed
the
question
presented,
framed
it
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
corps
could
rationally
regulate
wetlands
that
were
adjacent
to
navigable
waters
and
their
tributaries.
and
when
they
got
to
the
holding,
this
court
approved
the
regulation
and
approved
the
fact
that
it
asserted
jurisdiction
over
wetlands
adjacent
to
otherwise
regulable
waters.
so
if
the
tributaries
are
otherwise
regulable
because
they
are
waters
of
the
united
states,
it
follows
directly
from
riverside
bayview
that
the
adjacent
wetlands
are
covered
as
well.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
and...
and
i'm...
i
wish
that
weren't
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i
would
say,
though,
is
that
this
case
has
just
not
framed
up
the
question
of
tributaries,
and
that's
because...
i
mean,
to
put
it
more
favorably
to
my
client,
the
other
side
has
never
taken
issue
with
the
fact
that
their
wetlands
are
adjacent
to
tributaries.
and
i
think
that's...
that's
obvious
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
the
property
in
carabell,
it's
just
a
mile
from
lake
st.
clair.
it's
right
next
to
a
substantial
drainage
ditch
which
connects
to
a
navigable
water,
auvase
creek,
and
then
into
lake
st.
clair.
in
fact,
it's
kind
of
ironic,
but
the
property
in
riverside
bayview
was
also
a
mile
away
from
lake
st.
clair.
so
it's
very
similar.
if
you
look
at
the
three
sites
at
issue
in
rapanos,
one
is
right
next
to
the
pine
river.
one
of
the
others...
the
whole
point
of
the
dredge
and
fill
operation
was
to
drain
the
wetland
through
the
adjacent
tributary
systems
so
the
water
would
go
away.
and
in
the
third
one,
there
also
isn't
an
issue
about
whether
or
not
those
are
tributaries.
in
a
different
case,
that
might
be
an
appropriate
focus
for
inquiry.
the
last
thing,
i
would
say
a
couple
of
points
before
i
sit
down.
i
do
think,
first,
that
section
404(g)
of
the
statute
is
very
important
because
it
is
the
clearest
textual
indication
that
congress
intended
to
regulate
something
beyond
traditional
navigable
waterways
and
their
adjacent
wetlands.
and
as
this
court
itself
remarked
in
swancc,
the
single
most
likely
candidate
are
the
non-navigable
tributaries.
the
second
point
to
emphasize
is
that
the
scope
of
the
corps'
404
jurisdiction
is
the
same
as
the
epa's
402
jurisdiction.
they
are
joined
at
the
hip
through
the
basic
prohibition
under
section
301.
so
a
conclusion
that
somehow
certain
tributaries
are
excised
from
the
tributary
system
for
purposes
of
404
is
likewise
excising
those
tributaries
and
creating
a
situation
where
you
can
have
a...
a
free
dump
zone
at
some
point
above
the...
above
what
somebody
might
put
as
the
limits
of
the
navigable
waterway
system
or
the
tributary
system.
and
i
think
that
is
something
that
even
the
proponents
of
narrowing
the
corps'
jurisdiction
in
1977
could
not
countenance.
the
last
point
i
would
make
is
that
there
are
going
to
be
real-world
consequences
to
contracting
the
jurisdiction
of
the
corps
and
the
epa
to
pre-1972
or,
really,
pre-1899
levels,
especially
for
the
downstream
states.
i
think
it's
a
bit
much
to
ask
a
legislator
in
wisconsin
or
in
minnesota
to
stop
local
development
in
order
to
protect
the
water
quality
and
flood
control
propensities
of
the
mississippi
river
in
mississippi.
that's
why
it
was
manifest
in
1972
that
there
was
a
need
for
a
federal
solution
to
this
problem.
that
federal
solution
includes
as
two
of
its
most
important
components
first
getting
at
water
pollution
at
its
source,
at
the
point
source,
and
secondly,
covering
the
tributary
system
without
which
the
navigable
waters
will
continue
to
be
polluted.
thank
you.
