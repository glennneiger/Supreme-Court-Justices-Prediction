justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
they're
doing
it
for
a
functional
reason.
the
functional
reason
is
that
if
you
put
the
poison
in
the
adjacent
wetland,
it's
going
to
get
into
the
navigable
water.
exactly
the
same
argument
can
be
made
as
you
go
further
and
further
up
the
tributaries,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
once
you
concede,
as
i
think
you
have
to,
that
there
can
be
a
regulation
that
goes
beyond
literally
navigable
water
at
the
point
at
which
the...
the
pollutant
is
added,
then
you
have
to
follow
the
same
logic
right
up
through
the
watershed
to...
to
any
point
at
which
a
pollutant,
once
added,
will
eventually
get
into
the
navigable
water.
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
you
have
to
accept
the
fact
that...
that
congress
cannot
effectively
regulate
the
navigable...
the...
the
condition
of
the
navigable
water
itself
because
if
all
the...
the...
let's...
let's
assume
there's
a
class
of...
of
evil
polluters
out
there
who
just
want
to
wreck
the...
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
all
they
have
to
do
is
get
far
enough
upstream
and
they
can
dump
anything
they
want
to.
it
will
eventually
get
into
the
navigable
water,
and
congress
can't
do
anything
about
it
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're...
you're
going
to...
you...
you
then
want
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
dredge
and
fill
addition
and,
let's
say,
a...
a
conventional
synthetic
poison.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
on...
on...
in
every...
in
every
case
then,
i
mean,
congress
would
have
to...
i'm
sorry...
a
scientist
would
have
to
analyze
the
molecules
and...
and
trace
them
up,
and
so
long
as
they
could...
could
trace
it
to
a
specific
discharge,
they
could
get
at
it,
but
otherwise
they
couldn't?
i
mean,
that...
you
know,
you
know
what
i'm
getting
at.
that
obviously
would...
would
totally
thwart
the
regulation.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
doesn't
the
reference
to
tributary
make
it
relatively
plain
that
what
the
court
was
getting
at
was
the
impossibility
of
drawing
a
functional
distinction
between
wetlands
and
tributaries
on
the
one
hand,
navigable
waters
on
the
other,
when
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
is
to
protect
the
purity
of
the
ultimate
navigable
water?
and
isn't
the
inclusion
of
the
reference
to
tributaries
an
indication
that
it
said
if
we
want
to
attain
the
objective,
which
is
clearly
constitutional,
then
we
have
got
to
recognize
these
means,
i.e.,
regulation
of...
of
pollution
in
wetlands
and
tributaries,
in
order
to
reach
that
objective?
isn't
that
the
reasoning
that
is
apparent
from
what
justice
ginsburg
just...
just
read
to
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's...
except
for
the...
it
seems
to
me
except
for...
for
your...
your
argument
is...
is
fine
except
for
one
problem.
and
that
is,
if
we...
if
we
assume
that
congress
was
being
as...
as
cautious
as
you
suggest,
then
congress'
caution,
in
effect,
was...
was
allowing
an
end
run
around
the
regulation
for
the
reasons
we
went
into
a
moment
ago.
all
you've
got
to
do
is...
is
dump
the
pollutant
further...
far
enough
upstream
in
the
watershed
and
you
get
away
scot-free.
and
it's
very
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
could
have
intended
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
they
have
to
make
this
on
a
plot-by-plot
basis,
or
can
they
make
a
categorical
judgment
that
even
in
cases
in
which,
you
know,
there's
a
berm,
as
there
is
here,
when
the
water
is
high,
it
spills
over?
and
if
the
categorical
judgment
is
sound,
do
you
have
an
exception
because
they
haven't
proven
it
with
respect
to
your
particular
lot?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
do
you
get
that
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the...
and
the...
but
i
mean,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
the
traditional
test
is
the
basis
for
a
categorical
judgment.
your
land
falls
within
the
general
category.
your
argument
is
i
should
not
be
subject
to
it,
to
the
statute,
because
of
the
general
category.
i
should
be
subject
to
it
only
if
they
prove
specifically
that
the
water
spills
over
in
rainy
periods
in
my
particular
lot.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
there's
got
to
be
a
specific
connection
as
opposed
to
a
categorical
judgment.
and
my
question
is
what
under
the
act
supports
that
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
your...
maybe
what
you're
saying
is
we
have
shown
or
the
record
shows
that
this
doesn't
fit
within
the
category
because
it
never
spills
over
or
whatever.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
report
in
the...
is
the
subsequent
report
in
the
record
somewhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
again,
where--
justice
david
h.
souter
--where
are
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
justice
stevens'
question
i
think
in...
in
that
framework
is...
is
this.
if
it
will
result
in
discharge
after
the
project,
is
it
a
water
of
the
united
states
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
congress
has
passed
a
statute
that
says
we'll
lock
the
barn
after
the
horse
is
stolen.
i
mean,
that...
maybe
that's
what
it
did,
but
that's...
that
would
be
a
very
odd
thing
for
it
to
do,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it...
it
would
do
so
in...
in
cases
of...
i
guess,
of
the...
the
sorts
of...
of
new
proposed
actions
that
require
the...
the
corps
to
get
into
it
in
the
first
place.
but
i
also
assume
that
it
would
leave
lots
of...
of
water
pollution
regulation
to
the
states.
i
don't
see
that
it
would
displace
the
states.
