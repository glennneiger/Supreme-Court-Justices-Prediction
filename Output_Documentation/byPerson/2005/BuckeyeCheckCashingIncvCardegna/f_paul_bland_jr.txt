mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
federal
law
preempts
state
law
only
where
congress
clearly
and
manifestly
intended
for
it
to
do
so.
and
the
court
has
also
repeatedly
said
that
the
best
guide
to
what
congress
intended
was
the
language
of
the
statutes.
now,
petitioners
have
not
pointed
to
any
language
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
itself
that
would
create
a
separability
rule
for
this
case.
and
moreover,
the
language
of
the
act
itself
and
particularly
section
2...
and
particularly
section
2
the
way
it
was
followed
in
the
prima
paint
case...
actually
strongly
supports
us.
section
2
says
that
an
arbitration
provision
is
enforceable
if
it
is
in
a
contract
evidencing
interstate
commerce.
now,
to
order
of
arbitration,
they
say,
well,
the...
the
threshold
issue
is
whether
there's
an
agreement.
let's
have
the
arbitrator
decide
that.
to
order
arbitration
is
to
enforce
the
act.
that
is
enforcing
the
act.
but
they
want
to
enforce
the
act
before
we've
determined
if
section
2
is
met,
before
the
requirements
of
section
2
are
met.
that's
not
the
way--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--that's
an
argument.
the
word
agreement
was
used
in
section
4,
and
that's
the...
that
provision,
of
course,
is
the
provision
that
refers
only
to
the...
not
only
applies
to
the
united
states
district
courts,
that
refers
to
jurisdiction
under
title
28
and
twice
refers
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
that
in
the
southland
case
in
footnote
10,
this
court
said
doesn't
apply
in
the
state
courts.
section
2
doesn't
use
the
word
agreement.
section
2
uses
the
word
contract,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
word
contract
is
a
very
different
idea
than
agreement.
if
section
2
had
said
an
agreement
in
interstate
commerce
or
a
transaction
in
interstate
commerce,
perhaps
they
would
have
a
point.
but
the
court,
instead,
used...
excuse
me.
the
congress,
instead,
used
the
word
contract.
contract
is
one
of
the
most
important
words
in
the
law.
now,
when
the
court
in
prima
paint
looked
at
this,
in
the
first
sentence,
the
very
first
sentence
of
prima
paint,
the
court
said
this
case
involves
a
contract
involving
the
u.s.
arbitration
act.
and
in
the
first
sentence,
the
court
said
this
case
is
a
case
involving
contracting
parties.
the
court
didn't
say
we're
going
to
see
what
the
arbitrator
thinks
as
to
whether
there's
a
contract.
in
prima
paint,
this
court
did
it
the
right
way.
they
said
section
2...
does
it
apply
first?
only
if
it
does
apply,
only
if
once
after
we
have
crossed
that
rubicon
will
we
go
to
the
next
step.
then
the
court
in
prima
paint
goes
and
discusses
whether
or
not
the
interstate
commerce
prong
has
been
met.
and
there'
s
a
long
discussion
of
is
this
in
interstate
commerce
or
not,
and
they
find
that
it
is.
well,
under
their
theory,
under
petitioner's
theory,
why
should
the
court
be
deciding
interstate
commerce.
arbitrator...
the
interstate
commerce
issue
goes
to
the
whole
contract.
why
shouldn't
the
arbitrator
decide
the
interstate
commerce
issue?
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
we...
we
do
not
in
any
way
urge
this
court
to
overturn...
the
court
does
not
need
to
overturn
southland,
your
honor.
and
let
me
make
two
points
about
southland.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
let...
before
i
go
on
with
the
statutory
arguments--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--let
me...
before
i
talk
about
the
statutory
arguments,
then
let
me
go
to
the
policy
arguments
and
this
idea
that
we're
going
to
open
the
flood
gates
and
undermine
the
federal
arbitration
act.
it
is
a
minimal
requirement
to
say
that
you
must
have
a
contract
in
interstate
commerce.
and
in
the
southland
case,
on
page
10,
at
the
bottom
of
page
10
and
page
11,
before
it
said
that
section
2
would
apply
in
states,
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
for
this
court
started
off
and
said
there...
we
perceive
two
limitations
on
arbitration...
on
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
provisions.
and
the
first
of
those
is
it
does
have
to
be
in
a
contract
in
interstate
commerce.
so
there
is
nothing
in
southland
that
said,
oh,
well,
the
question
about
whether
or
not
there's
a
contract
is
something
the
arbitrator
gets
to
decide.
the
beginning
of
the
opinion
said
that
particular
issue
is
one
for
the...
is
one
that
is
a
limitation
on
the
enforceability
of
contracts.
is
this
going
to
lead
to
an
explosion
of
litigation
over
the
formation
of
contracts?
it
will
not
because
there
are
fairly
few
cases
where
there
is
an
argument
that
the
entire
contract
is
void
ab
initio
such
that
it
comes
up.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
after
the
national
banking
act,
your
honor,
there
are
actually
very
few
usury
cases
left.
if
you
look
at
the
six
cases
they
cite
that
are
all...
they
say
they're
federal.
there
are
six
federal
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
support
them.
four
of
those
are
payday
lending
cases
decided
since
2000.
the
principal
economic
effect
of
this
case
actually
is
going
to
involve
the
payday
lending
industry.
and
was
it
irrational
for
the
state
of
florida
to
say
that
it's
loan
sharking
to
charge
people
up
to
1300
percent
interest?
we
think
that
that...
whether...
whether
florida
made
a
good
decision
or
not
with
its
usury
laws,
usury
laws
just
don'
t
apply
to
many
cases.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
fraud
in
the
inducement
does
not
go
to
rendering
the
contract
void
ab
initio.
a
contract
comes
into
existence.
you
cross
the
statutory
language
of
section
2.
fraud
in
the
inducement...
there
is
a
contract.
now
one
party
has
a
defense
to
it.
suppose--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--well,
the...
the...
your
honor,
first,
the
congress
drew
the
line
when
it
said
that
you
had
to
have
a
contract
first
as
to
whether
or
not
a
contract
came
into
existence.
but
the
law
of
contracts
does
not
differ
so
much
from
state
to
state.
this
case
in
the
american
airlines
v....
this
court...
excuse
me...
in
the
american
airlines
v.
wolens
case
said
that
the
law
of
contracts
is
not
largely
disuniform
from
state
to
state,
and
there
is
no
state
in
the
country
that
i
know
of...
and
i'm
fairly
certain
of
this...
that
hold
that
fraud
in
the
inducement
means
that
a
contract
never
came
into
existence.
and
the
reason
for
that
is...
is
that
if
someone
defrauds
me
into
buying
a
stock
or
someone
has
an
unconscionable
deal
or
almost
any
of
the
other
things
that
give
rise
to
defenses
to
formed
contracts,
one
party
has
an
option
to
get
of
out
it.
if
someone
defrauds
me
into
buying
a
stock
but
then
the
stock
price
shoots
up
through
the
roof...
it's
one
of
justice
breyer's
clever
technology
inventions
that
works--
[laughter]
--i
have
an
option
at
that
point
to
hold
onto
the
stock,
even
though
i
was
defrauded.
i
was
defrauded.
i
was
cheated,
but
i'm
happy
with
it.
it
turns
out
it's
okay.
it
is
left
to
the
option--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--of
the
party.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
i
think
you
will
find,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the...
at
the
law
that's
developed
around
void
ab
initio
contracts,
that
it's
fairly
rare.
it's
a
fairly
small
universe
of
cases
where
state
courts
have
found
that
an
entire
line
of
business
is
illegal,
where
state
courts
have
found
that
no
contract
ever
comes
into
existence
because
of
a
public
policy.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
but,
your
honor,
there
are
already
a
host
of
circumstances
in
which
litigants
would
like
to
be
able
to
get
out
of
contracts
that
do
not
involve
arbitration
clauses,
where
they
would
like
to
be
able
to
argue
that
no
contract
came
into
existence
in
the
first
place.
and
the
public
policy
typically...
and
in
florida
particularly...
tends
to
be
linked
to
statutes.
in
most
states,
there
is
a
rule
that
says
of
contract
law,
that
we
will
not
void
a
contract
because
some
judge
feels
there's
a
public
policy,
but
it
has
to
be
based
on
a
statute.
and
we
cited
several
cases,
and
the
law
professors
in
professor
alderman
and
braucher's
brief
cited
a
variety
of
cases
around
the
country
in
which
courts
have
only
struck
down
contracts
for
public
policy
where
they
violated
a
statute
that
forbid
equality.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
no
reason
to
suspect
that
there's
going
to
be
abuse
in
which
parties
are
going
to
come
in
and
make
frivolous
arguments
that
an
entire
line
of
business
is
illegal
and
then...
and
that
that's
going
to
cause
a
flood
gate
of
cases
into
courts
because
courts
have,
with
rule
11
and
other
similar
rules,
a
lot
of
ways
of
getting
rid
of
those.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
it's
very
hard--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--please.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
exactly,
and
that's
the
language--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--no.
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
that's
the
language
that...
that
the
separability
rule
in
prima
paint
has
been
used
to
apply
to.
the
first
part
of
section
2
says
this
is
how
you
create
an
arbitration
provision.
you
have
an
enforceable
provision
if
it's
in
a
contract,
but
there
is
an
exception
for
general
state
contract
laws
that
provide
defenses
to
a
contract.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
that--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--because
that--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--the
first
part
of
it
is
the
way
you...
the
way
you
trigger
the
existing
forceability
option
at
all
is
that
it
has
to
be
in
a
contract
in
interstate
commerce.
that's
why
in
prima
paint
the
court
went
through
interstate
commerce
rather
than
leaving
that
for
the
arbitrator.
the
second
part
is
once
you
have
an
enforceable
agreement,
it
may
be
subject
to
certain
defenses.
and
then
in
prima
paint,
what
this
court
did
was
it
looked
at
section
4
of
the
act
and
it
derived
from
section
4
of
the
act,
the
one
that
only
applies
in
federal
court
and
refers
to
the
federal
rules
of
judicial
procedure,
a
rule
of
separability
for
these
kinds
of
defenses,
for
the
defenses
that
arise
in
the
savings
clause.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
way
that
it
makes
sense
is
that
the...
you
get
the
threshold
issue
of
getting
through
the
limitation,
as
this
court
described
it
in
southland
on
pages
10
and
11,
of
the
limitation
on
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
clauses
of
is
it
in
a
contract
in
the
first
place.
that
is
the...
what
the
first
part
is
talking
about.
then
separately
the
court...
the...
the
congress
had
intended
only
a
limited
intrusion
into
state
law,
as
this
court
said
in
the
volt
case
where
it
said
that
this...
that
there
was
not...
this
is
not
the
national
bank
act.
there
was
no
field
preemption.
there
was
no
express
preemption.
there
was
only
conflict
preemption.
and
in
the
allied
bruce
case,
what
justice
breyer's
opinion
for
the
court
said
was
we
recognize
that
state
law
will
play
an
important
role
for
certain
contract
defenses
after
the
contract
has
first
been
found
to
be
enforceable.
i
think
that
if...
if
this
jurisdictional
idea...
the
way
you
get
into
the
arbitration
act,
what
triggers
that
the
arbitration
act
exists...
and
this
is
pretty
much
the
language
that's
used
at
the...
in
the
bottom
of
10
and
top
of
11
of
southland...
is
that
you
have
an
arbitration
agreement
that's
enforceable.
then
there
is
a
but
in
which
congress
left
out
an
alternative
where
you
have
specific
challenges
to
how
the
arbitration
clause
is
formed.
i
think
that
that's
a
very
workable
system,
but
that's
also
the
way
congress
drafted
the
statute.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
no,
i'm
afraid
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
i...
i
think
two
things,
your
honor.
first,
i'
d
like
to
say
that
i
think
an
enormous
difference
between
the
european
illustrations,
for
example,
that
you
give
in
this
setting
is
that
here
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
not
a
common
law
rule
of
let's
push
as
many
cases
as
we
can
from
the
civil
justice
system
into
arbitration.
it
is
a
statute
that
has
language.
and
the
way
this
court
has
treated
that
language
before
is
this
court
has
always
said
not
until
the
case
falls
within
section
2
will
you
then
go
and
enforce
section
2,
that
you
have
to
be
in
the
act
before
you
apply
the
act.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
and
i
think
that
that
language
is--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--those
are
issues
that
we
believe
also
are
issues
that
a
court
would
resolve.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
there
are
very
few--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--i
think
that
when
your
honor
used
the
word
far,
that
that...
that
that
is
not
really
fair.
there
are
really
very,
very
few
contracts
in
the
united
states
of
america
in
2005
that
are
going
to
be
struck
down
because
there
wasn'
t
enough
consideration.
that
sort
of
argument
against
contract
formation
very
rarely
comes
up.
i
do
a
ton
of
consumer
contract
cases.
we've
never
gotten
rid
of
a
contract
on
the
grounds
there
wasn't
consideration.
these
doctrines
are
on
the
books.
they
are
certainly
part
of
what
makes
a
contract
different
from
an
agreement.
it'
s
certainly
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
think
it's
important
that
congress
chose
such
a
loaded
word,
but
these...
there
are
very
few
cases
that
involve
this.
and...
and
one
thing
about
the...
about
the
illegal
issue
and
the
voidability...
the...
the
void
ab
initio
issue
that
your
honor
raises.
in
florida...
and
we
cited
a
number
of
cases
of
this
in
our
brief
and
in
the...
in...
both
in
our
brief
and...
and
in
the
contract
law
professors'
amicus
brief,
there's
a
number
of
cases
around
the
country.
you
only
strike
down
a
contract
as
void
ab
initio
where
the
principal
purpose,
the
essence
of
the
contract
is
that...
that
it
was
to
do
an
illegal
purpose,
was
that
it
was
to
violate
a
statute
as
reflected
in...
as...
as
it
would
reflect
the
public
policy
of
a
state.
you
could
have
a
contract
that
has
one
or
two
illegal
provisions
or
minor
legal
provisions.
those
are
not
enough
to
get
the
entire
contract
thrown
out
as
void
ab
initio.
it's
a
much
higher
test.
if
i
can
use
an
analogy.
there
may
be
a
lot
of
people
who
wish
they
weren't
married,
but
meeting
the
tests
of
annulment
are
very
different
from
divorce.
trying
to
prove
that
a
contract
is
void
ab
initio
such
that
it
is
so
extremely
illegal
that
no
provision
of
it
will
come
into
contract
doesn't
come
up
very
often.
what
we
are
talking
about
with
void
ab
initio
contracts
that
violate
public
policies
and
statutes
are
we
are
talking
about
businesses
that
are
skirting
around
on
the
edge
of
legality.
we
are
talking
about
a
business
where
there
is
a
colorable
argument
that
someone
can
go
into
court
and
say,
this
entire
line
of
business
is
loan
sharking.
it's
a
crime.
it's
29
times
the...
the
felony
rate
of
loan
sharking
in
florida.
that'
s
why
so
many
of
these
cases
are
payday
lending
cases.
you
don't
see
a
lot
of
void
ab
initio
cases
in
which
come...
someone
comes
in
and
say,
hey,
you
know,
they
sold
me
a
car
and
the
entire
line
of
business
of
car
selling
was
void
ab
initio.
the
only
example
that's
supposed
to
show
the
flood
gates
that
has
come
from
petitioner's
brief
is
they
cite
to
this
vacation
beach
case
in
florida.
and
what...
that
was
a
case
that
involved
was
sort
of
a
uniquely
florida
problem,
but
after
a
bunch
of
hurricanes,
they've
had
people
come
down
who
were
unlicensed
contractors
and
they
go
and
say
we
know
how
to
fix
roofs
and
so
forth
and
they
do
not.
and
then
people's
roofs
blow
off,
and
there
have
actually
been
a
number
of
people
who
have
died.
so
the
state
set
up
a
licensing
regime
that
was
a
licensing
regime
not
designed
to
extort
money
from
businesses,
but
a
licensing
regime
designed...
scheme
based
on
safety
and
health
and
welfare
of
the
citizens
and
said,
you
can't
go
into
this
line
of
business
without
passing
certain
certifications.
so
in
that
case,
it
was
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
which
a
company...
in
which
a
company
comes
in
and
says,
this
company
is
falsely
representing
they
know
how
to
do
this
work
and
they
don't.
and
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
notes
it
could
be
a
crime.
and
now
petitioner
comes
in
and
says,
well,
this
is
an
outrage.
of
course,
the
arbitrator
should
decide
that
question
in
the
first
place.
no.
that's
a
business
that
is
arguably...
and
probably
more
than
arguably...
operating
on
the
outskirts
of
the
law.
their
reliance
interests
are
different.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
because...
because
the
language
of
the
statute
is
what
draws
the
key
link
difference
to
me,
your
honor.
the
statute
says
an
arbitration
provision
is
enforceable
if
it
is
in
a
contract
evidencing
interstate
commerce.
the
in
a
contract
makes
the
legality
of
the
whole
contract...
for
the
contract
comes
into
existence.
you
can't
drive
this
car
until
you
start
it,
and
the
way
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
works
is
it
becomes
enforceable
once
those
terms
are
met.
under
their
theory,
there's
no
good
reason
why
in
prima
paint
this
court
spent
all
those
pages
talking
about
whether
interstate
commerce
was
met.
why
wasn't
that
for
the
arbitrator?
the
reason
that
that
wasn't
for
the
arbitrator
was
that
was
something
that
went
to
the
threshold
issue
of
whether
section
2
had
been
met.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
your
honor,
in
this
case
i
believe
that
the
answer
is
that
you
would
have
the
same
result
in
state
court
or
in
federal
court.
and
the
reason
i
believe
that
is
because
section
2
makes
the
existence
of
a
contract
a
precondition,
and
you
don't
get
to
anything
else
if
that
is
not
met.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
yes,
we
do
believe
that,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
and
of
course,
in
the
efabco
case--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--well,
that...
this
court
2
years
ago
in
2003
in
the
efabco
case,
the
alabama
supreme
court
had
developed
a
practice
of
finding
that
lots
of
contracts
didn't
involve
interstate
commerce
and
interstate
commerce
didn't
reach
to
a
lot
of
things.
and
this
court
just
2
years
ago
said
this
is
an
issue
for
the
court
and
there
is
interstate
commerce
here
and
they...
they...
and
this
court...
i
can't
remember
the
phrase...
per
curiam.
there
was
no
need
for
an
argument
or
whatever.
the
court
just
came
in
and
resolved
it--
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
--this
was
an
arbitration
case,
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
had
said
that
we're
not
going
to
enforce
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
alabama
is
one
of
the
three
states
that
has...
that
has
a
state
statute
that
bars
it.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
but
it...
but
it
is
also
a
statutory
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
it's
a
fact
that
the
statute
says
both.
it
is
a
constitutional
fact.
i
certainly
concede
that.
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
i
did
not
answer...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
your
honor,
it's...
it
would
not
throw
a
monkey
wrench
because
it's
exactly
what
happened
in
prima
paint.
in
prima
paint,
this
court
started
off
and
before
it
enforced
the
arbitration
act,
before
it
got
into
what
it
called
the
main
issue
and
started
talking
about
what
does
section
4
mean,
this
court
first
went
and
did
the
entire
interstate
commerce
analysis.
this
court
said,
we've
got
to
figure
out
if
we're
in
section
2
first
and
described
that.
it's
not
the
monkey
wrench.
it's
exactly
what's
happened.
and
in
the
efabco
case,
it
was
a
issue
for
the
court.
to
say
that
now,
whether
or
not
section
2
exists
except
for
the
assent
agreement,
but
everything
else
about
a
contract
and
everything
else
about
interstate
commerce
would
suddenly
be
for
the
arbitrator,
that
is
an
exact
shift
from
what
this
court
did
in
prima
paint,
and
it's
a
shift
from
what
chief
justice
warren
burger
said
in
the...
in
the
southland
case,
that
this
is
a
prerequisite.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
well,
where
these
cases
come
up
again
and
again,
your
honor,
is
someone
brings
a
lawsuit
in
court
and
then
there
is
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration
and
there
is
a
challenge
to
that
motion.
there
are
next
to
no
challenges
anywhere
in
the
country
right
now
in
the...
after
your
decision
2
years
ago,
in
which
anyone
is
saying,
oh,
this
transaction
doesn't
involve
interstate
commerce.
there
are
going
to
be
a
small
number
of
challenges
involving
companies
operating
at
the
edge
of
legality
and
maybe
a
tiny
number
of
challenges
involving
consideration
where
people
are
going
to
be
able
to
say
there's
no
contract
at
all,
there's
not
even
a...
there's
not
even
a
beginning
of
a
contract
here.
there's
not
going
to
be
a
wealth
of
hundreds
of
the...
of
those,
but
there's
going
to
be
some
cases,
mostly
involving
the
payday
lending
industry,
but
they're
just
aren't
dozens
of
businesses
out
there
where
there
is
a
conceivable,
plausible,
colorable
argument
that
the
whole
line
of
business
is
violating
the
law.
mr.
f.
paul
bland,
jr.
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
illegal
will
be
something
that's
decided
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
but
that
question...
first
of
all,
if
this
case
is
sent
back
to
arbitration,
the
arbitration
clause,
of
course,
is
on
an
individual
basis
and
this
case
could
never
be
pursued
on
an
individual
basis.
if
it's
not
done
as
a
class
action,
it
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
but
moreover,
the
arbitrator
is
basically
free
to
ignore
what
the
ruling
of
the
florida
supreme
court
is.
you
know,
there
was
a
ruling
from
the
third
circuit
a
few
weeks
ago
that
said
that
glaring
errors
of
law
are
not
grounds
for
overturning
an
arbitration
decision.
so
the
florida
supreme
court
could
come
out
and
say
this
is
plainly
illegal,
and
then
a
row
of
arbitrators
could
come
in
and
say,
seems
okay
to
us,
and
there's
really
not
going
to
be
a
court
challenge
to
that.
so
i
would
not
agree
with
that
as
a
matter
of...
as
a
matter
of
practical
reality,
your
honor.
this
state
law
that
we're
talking
about
is
not
about
hostility
to
arbitration.
the
rule
that
distinguishes
between
void
contracts
and
the
small
universe
of
cases
that
are
void
ab
initio
is
a
rule
that
goes
back
something
like
a
hundred
years
in
florida
and
it
goes
back
hundreds
more
years
through...
it's
come
up
in
decisions
of
this
court.
it
has
come
up
in
decisions
of
english
courts
that
go
back
that
were
traced
by
the
contract
professors.
at
the
time
that
the
congress
wrote
the
arbitration
act
in
1925,
this
distinction
was
set
out
in
corbin
and
in
the
first
restatement
of
contracts.
this
is
basic,
core
common
law
of
contracts.
and
the
idea
that
in
1925
congress
wanted
to
throw
out
all
of
the
basic
core
rules
of
contracts
and,
instead,
replace
them
with
some
new
federal
rule
of
contract,
when
they
didn't
define
contract,
and
when
they
put
it
as
a
precondition
before
the
act
applies,
the
idea
that
general
rules
of
state
contract
law
are
going
to
be
tossed
overboard
is
really
going
to
be
a
dramatic
change
for
this
court...
for
this
court'
s
jurisprudence.
in
case
after
case,
this
court
has
said
arbitration
clauses
are
as
enforceable
as
other
contracts,
but
no
more
so.
and
that
was
the
basis
of
this
court's
ruling
in
the
eeoc
v.
waffle
house
case
just
a
few
years
ago.
just
like
petitioner
here,
the
waffle
house
was
saying
arbitration
clauses
are
sort
of
super
contracts.
they
are
something
so
many
businesses
have
relied
on,
as
justice
breyer
says,
that
they
are...
that
they
are
treated
by
a
different
and
better
set
of
rules.
these
are
contracts
which
are
just
better
and
more
important
than
other
contracts.
and
this
court
stopped
and,
in
justice
stevens'
opinion
in
the
waffle
case,
said
slow
down.
first,
you
just
have
to
treat
these
like
other
contracts.
and
here,
there's
no
signature
line
for
the
eeoc.
the
eeoc
didn't
sign
on.
we're
going
to
treat
this
like
another
contract,
and
by
a
6
to
3
vote,
this
court
found
that
you
couldn't
enforce
it.
they
want
to
put
the
cart
before
the
horse.
they
want
to
enforce
this
arbitration
act
before
its
terms
were
met.
that
is
not
what
this
court
did
in
prima
paint.
prima
paint
did
it
right.
they
said
section
2
first
and
only
if
section
2
applies,
then
do
we
jump
to
the
next
point,
you
know,
sort
of
dinner
before
dessert.
and
that
was
the
appropriate
approach
because
you
have
to
find
out
if
section
2
is
there
and
cross
that
threshold
before
you
start
saying
now
that
we're
in
the
federal
arbitration
act,
how
much
fun
would
it
be
to
apply
section
4,
the
part
that
keeps
talking
about
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
to
cases
in
state
court
proceedings
and
apply
a
decision
that
was
based
entirely
on
language
in
section
4
to
state
court
proceedings.
that
is
simply
an
enormous
expansion
of
the
law
in
this
area,
and
we
urge
the
court
strongly
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you.
