well,
prima
paint
did,
though,
involve
what
we
would
characterize
as
a
voidable
contract.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
it
is
conceivable
that
the
florida
court
was
correct
that
you
could
draw
the
line
some
way
and
say
contracts
that
are
void
should
be
handled
differently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
voidness
is
a
question
of
public
policy.
the
state
itself
makes
a
decision
that
certain
contracts
can't
be
entered
into.
and
the
question
of
voidability
is
usually
one
affecting
the...
the
will
of
the
contracting
party.
