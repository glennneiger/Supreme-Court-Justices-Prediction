if
the
case
was
one
in
which
the
merits
issue
you
claim
is
basically
the
same
as
the
legality
issue
under
the
contract...
but
would
your
argument
be
as
strong
if
it
were
different,
if
you
had
a
different
reason
for
claiming
that
the
contract
was
void
or
voidable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
possibility
that
you
always
want
a
neutral
decision
maker
in
cases
like
this?
the
arbitrator
always
has
an
interest
in
finding
that
the
contract
is
valid
and
arbitrable
because
that's
his
source
of
business
is
arbitrating
disputes.

no.
i'm
just
talking
about
as
a
general
matter
if
we're
trying
to
decide
the
issue
not
just
on
these
facts,
but
what
is
the
better
rule--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bland,
i'm
curious
to
know
if
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
whoever
decides
it,
an
arbitrator
or
a
judge,
it's
really
going
to
be
decided
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
the
next
couple
of
months.
