mr.
christopher
landau
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
a
party
can
avoid
arbitration
by
challenging
the
validity
of
the
underlying
contract
containing
an
arbitration
clause
as
opposed
to
the
arbitration
clause
itself.
we
believe
that
this
court
answered
that
question
almost
40
years
ago
in
prima
paint.
the
florida
supreme
court
tried
to
distinguish
prima
paint
on
state
law
grounds,
holding
that
the
challenge
at
issue
there,
fraud
in
the
inducement,
would
have
rendered
the
contract
voidable
under
state
law,
whereas
the
challenge
at
issue
here,
illegality,
would
have
rendered
the
contract
void
under
state
law.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
distinction
misses
the
point.
prima
paint
held
that
a
party
cannot
avoid
arbitration
by
challenging
the
validity
of
the
underlying
contract
as
opposed
to
the
arbitration
clause
because
an
embedded
arbitration
provision
is
severable
from
the
underlying
contract
as
a
matter
of
federal
substantive
law.
thus,
the
nature
of
the
state
law
ground,
on
which
the
underlying
contract
is
challenged,
and
the
state
law
severability
implications
of
that
challenge
are
irrelevant.
what
matters,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
is
that
a
challenge
to
the
underlying
contract
does
not
allow
a
court
to
deny
arbitration.
rather,
that
challenge
must
be
presented
to
the
arbitrator
in
the
first
instance.
that
point,
we
submit,
is
dispositive.
mr.
christopher
landau
your
honor,
we--
mr.
christopher
landau
--your
honor,
we
concede
that
there
is
an
asterisk,
as
we
put
it
in
our
brief,
to
the
otherwise
bright
line
rule
set
down
in
prima
paint,
that
rule
being
if
you're
challenging
the
arbitration
clause,
you
can
stay
in
court,
but
if
you're
challenging
the
underlying
contract,
you
have
to
go
to
arbitration,
precisely
along
the
lines
that
your
honor
identified
where
the
challenge
to
the
underlying
contract
involves
the
parties'
assents
to
the
underlying
contract,
that
challenge
necessarily
challenges
your
assent
to
arbitration.
and
given
that
the
whole
premise
of
arbitration
in
the
first
place
is
that
it's
a
matter
of
consent,
we
would
say
that
that
particular
challenge,
as
the
lower
courts
have
recognized
since
prima
paint,
an
assent
based
challenge
to
the
underlying
contract,
is
again
an...
an
exception
or
an
asterisk
to
the
otherwise
bright
line
rule.
mr.
christopher
landau
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
christopher
landau
--you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor,
that
there
are
going
to
be
hard
cases.
if
i
could
just
start
by
answering
that
by
saying
i
think
one
thing
that's
clear
is
that
this
case
is
not
one
of
the
hard
ones.
the
challenge
to
the
underlying
contract
here--
mr.
christopher
landau
--i
think
generally
when
you're
not
saying
i
didn't
agree
to
the
underlying
contract,
in
other
words,
where
you're
not
saying
that's
a
forgery
or
the...
the
person
who
signed
that
didn't
have
authority,
where
you'
re...
where
you're
really...
where
you're
not
challenging
factual
agreement
to
the
underlying
contract,
then
it's
fair
game
to
send
you
to...
to
arbitration
because
when...
you
factually
agreed
to...
to
arbitrate.
mr.
christopher
landau
you
misinterpreted
my
letter.
the...
there
was
no
acceptance
at
all.
i
would
think
that
that's...
that
would
fall
within
the
scope
of
this
potential
asterisk
because
you're
basically
saying
i
never
agreed
to
any
contract
at
all.
so,
therefore,
i
would
think
under
those
circumstances,
the
whole
premise
of
the
prima
paint
rule
that...
that's
once
you've
agreed
to
arbitration,
you
can
let
the
arbitrator
decide
your
grievances
with
the
underlying
contract
is
not
present.
mr.
christopher
landau
your
honor,
that
is
not--
mr.
christopher
landau
--your
honor,
two
responses
to
that.
at
the
most
fundamental
level,
i
think
it
misses
the
point
to
talk
about
the
nature
or
the...
the
state
law
severability
implications
of
your
challenge
to
the
underlying
contract
because
the
insight
to
prima
paint
is
that
you
treat
the
arbitration
clause--
mr.
christopher
landau
--your
honor,
you're
entirely
correct,
and
i
think
again
the...
the
insight
of
prima
paint
is
that
you
are
perfectly
able
to
present
your
challenge
to
the
underlying
contract.
the
question
is,
who
is
the
person
to...
which
is
the
forum
in
which
you
present
that?
are
you
allowed
to...
to
present
that
in
court
or...
or
are
you
relegated
to...
or
are
you
required
to
submit
it
to
the
arbitrator
pursuant
to
your
agreement?
and...
and
i
think
the
prima
paint
court
recognized
that
if
you
allow
parties
to
avoid
arbitration
altogether
by
bringing
whatever
challenges
they
may
have
to
the
underlying
contract,
whether
it
be
fraud
in
the
inducement
or
illegality
or...
you
know,
there
are
obviously
any
number
of
grounds
for
challenging
contracts
under
state
law...
you
effectively
vitiate
the
arbitration
agreement,
the...
the
whole
point
of
which
is
that
we're
going
to...
we've
chosen
the
arbitrator
as...
the
arbitration
as
the
correct
forum
to
resolve
our
dispute.
and...
and
so
again,
as
long
as
you
are
not
challenging
arbitration
specifically...
the
arbitration
law
specifically,
then
it'
s
fair
game
to
send
you
to
arbitration,
again
where
you
are
perfectly
entitled
to
raise
the
whole
panoply
of
challenges
that
you
may
have.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
your
honor,
again,
i
think
the...
the
federal
arbitration
act,
both
section
4
and
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
certainly
permits
that...
that
way
of
looking
at
it
because
section
4,
as
prima
paint
emphasized,
says,
you
know,
once
the
making
of
the
arbitration
agreement
is
clear,
it
must
go
to
arbitration.
and
section
2
says
it's
the
arbitration
provision
in
a
written
contract...
or
the
written
provision
in
a
contract
that
shall
be
valid
and
enforceable.
and
so,
both
those
provisions
do
distinguish
between
the
arbitration
provision
specifically
and,
in
fact,
treat
it
as
an
underlying
contract.
and
again,
i
don't
think
there's
any
shame
in
admitting
that
prima
paint,
i
think,
recognized
the
important
policy
implications
of
a
contrary
rule,
that--
mr.
christopher
landau
--your
honor,
it
is
certainly
true
that
prima
paint
itself
arose
from
federal
court
and
that
the
decision
is,
i
think,
rather
carefully
written
to
talk
about
federal
courts
as
a...
in
fact,
justice
harlan
concurred
in
prima
paint
to
say
he
would
have
affirmed
the
second
circuit
in
that
case
on
the
basis
of
the
lawrence
case,
which
said
that
this
rule
applies
in
federal
and
state
court,
the
faa.
but
the
court
was
obviously
unwilling
in
prima
paint
to
cross
the
bridge
of
saying
that
our
rule
applies
in
state
court.
and
i
think
that,
frankly,
that's
why
it's
written
in
that
way
of...
of
focusing
on
section
4
and
not
really
specifically
addressing
section
2.
this
court,
however,
subsequently
confronted
that
issue
head
on
in
the
southland
case
and
held
that
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
really
relying
on
prima
paint
for
the
proposition
that
the...
the
federal
arbitration
act
does
create
federal
substantive
law
enacted
under
the
commerce
power...
it
says
that
that
rule...
those
rules
of
substantive
arbitration
law
apply
in
state
as
well
as
federal
court
because
you
really
wouldn't
want
to
attribute
to
congress
kind
of
a...
a
reverse
erie
presumption
of
creating
substantive
federal
law
that
applied
only
in
diversity
cases
in
federal
court
which
would
then
promote
forum
shopping
between
federal
and
state
courts.
mr.
christopher
landau
not
really,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
the...
the
insight
of
prima
paint,
again,
is
that
you
treat
the
arbitration
clause
as
separate
from
the
underlying
contract.
so--
mr.
christopher
landau
--your
honor,
that
is
certainly
one
plausible
world
view
that
one
could
have
taken
as
an
initial
matter
when
confronting
this
issue.
i
mean,
it's
a
little
bit
like
a
chicken
and
egg
issue
here.
you
have
got
the
underlying
contract,
which
contains
an
arbitration
provision,
and
one
could
certainly
say,
as
your
honor
just
did,
that
well,
if
the
underlying
contract
falls,
it
seems
perfectly
sensible
to
say
that
everything
falls.
this
court
specifically
rejected
that
approach
in
prima
paint.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
in
fact--
mr.
christopher
landau
--in
fact...
exactly.
the...
in
prima
paint
itself,
it
was
far
from
clear
that
the
rescission
suit
that
was
sought
there...
in
other
words,
when
a
contract
is...
is
voidable,
basically
what
that
does
is
that...
under
general
common
law
principles,
that
creates
an
option
for
the
aggrieved
party.
and
that
party
can
either
seek
to
affirm
that
contract
or
it
can
seek
to
rescind
that
contract.
and
when
you
seek
to
rescind
it,
basically
you're
saying
it
was
void
ab
initio,
which
is
exactly
what
justice
black
said
in
his
dissent
in
prima
paint.
mr.
christopher
landau
you
are
absolutely
right,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
should
lose
sight
of
the
bright
line
importance
of
the
prima
paint
rule.
but
in
a
sense,
prima
paint
again
is
a
rule
of
federal
law.
the
court
in
that
case
specifically
affirmed
the
federal
law
approach
taken
by
the
first
circuit
as
opposed
to
the
state
law
approach,
which
i
think
was
a
little
bit
like
your
honor's
hypothetical,
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical.
mr.
christopher
landau
oh,
sure,
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
think
about
the
mitsubishi
case,
all
the
cases
that
sent
statutory
cases
to
arbitrators
and
said
that,
you
know,
rico
claims
or
antitrust
claims
could
be
arbitrated,
i
think
initially
the...
the
argument
that
was
made
against
that
was
precisely
the
one
your
honor
is
making,
that,
gee,
arbitrators
have
expertise
in
the
specific
commercial
agreements
here,
but
we
don't
expect
them
to
be
knowledgeable
about
rico
or...
or
other
statutes.
but
i
think
the
insight
of
the
cases,
really
over
the
last
30
years
in
this
court,
is
that
arbitrators
are
perfectly
able
and
certainly
have
to
be
presumed
to
be
able
to
decide
legal
and
public
policy
questions.
and
i
think
if
you...
again,
if
you
go
the
other
way
and
you
say,
well,
we're
going
to
allow
challenges
to
the
arbitration
clause,
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
enforced,
i
think
you
are
really
going
to
declare
open
season
on
arbitration
in
the
sense
that
it
is...
as
a
logical
matter,
there
is
no
way
to
limit
the
principle
that
the
other
side
is
proposing
to
challenges
based
on
illegality,
which
is
what
they've
tried
to...
to
cabin
this
off
as.
basically...
and
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court
was
very
forthright
about
this...
they
said
it's
any
challenge
that
leads
to
the
contract
being
void
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
in
fact,
the...
the
respondents
in
their
brief
in
this
court
really
admit
that
it's
any
challenge
that
goes
to
contract
formation,
the
formation
at
all
of
the
underlying
contract.
so
they
would
presumably
sweep
in
all
things
like
consideration,
mutuality,
anything
that
could
be
a
ground
for
that.
mr.
christopher
landau
that
is
the
key
issue,
your
honor.
they
are
essentially
saying
that
the
underlying
interest
in
the
contract
is
usurious,
in
violation
of
several
florida
statutes.
and
again,
one
thing
that
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
there
is
no
question
that
these
issues
now,
the
practices
that
they're
complaining
about,
are
entirely
legal
in
florida
today.
there
was
an
act
passed
in
2001
that
clearly
made
all
this
legal.
the
only
issue
is
they're
saying
it
was
illegal
prior
to
enactment
of
that
statute
and
whether
or
not
that
statute
clarified
the
law
or
changed
the
previous
law.
but
presumably
the
arbitrator
would
be
asked
to
decide
is...
was
the
law
in
florida
prior
to
2001
such
that...
that
these
other
statutes
that
limited...
that
limited
interest
applied
here.
the
underlying
dispute
is
really
about
whether
these
charges
are
interest
or
whether
it's
a
service
fee
for
cashing
a
check.
that's
the
heart
of
the
underlying
dispute,
and
that's
certainly
one
that
the
arbitrator
is
capable
of
deciding--
mr.
christopher
landau
--looking
to
florida--
mr.
christopher
landau
--well,
i
think
the
arbitrator
will
say,
you
know...
first
of
all,
if
i
could
just
make
one
point
clear
for
the
record.
the...
this...
the
underlying
issue
here,
whether
or
not
this
2001
statute
changed
the
law
or
simply
clarified
the
law
is
currently
pending
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
it
was
argued
on...
on
september
30th
in...
in
a
case
that
did
not
involve
arbitration.
so
presumably,
the
arbitrator,
if
this
case
goes
to
arbitration,
will
look
at
that
case
and
will
decide
whether
or
not
that
governs
this
case,
will
decide
is
there
any
ground
for
distinguishing
this
case.
and...
and,
you
know,
one
point
to
remember
is
that
when
you
go
to
arbitration,
that's
not
the
end
of
the
line.
you
have
rights
to
judicial
review
of
arbitration.
so
going
back
to
your
hypothetical,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the...
if
the
contract
were
to
be,
let's
say,
for
murder...
that's
a
favorite
example
of...
of
respondents...
that
does
not
mean
that
a
contract
for
murder
gets
enforced.
that
means
that
the
arbitrator
will
decide
whether
the
contract
for
murder
is...
is
valid
under
state
law
and...
again,
this
is
in
the
far
fetched
situation
where
somebody
who
has
signed
a
contract
for
murder
is
actually
trying
to
enforce
arbitration,
you
know,
presumably
from
his
or
her
jail
cell--
[laughter]
--and
then
would...
would
try
to
enforce
arbitration,
and
then
if...
you
know,
if
the
arbitrator
says
it's
illegal,
would...
you
know,
even
if
the
arbitrator
were,
in
the
most
fanciful
situation,
to
say,
yes,
this
contract
for
murder
is
legal
under
the
law
of
our
state,
well,
then
presumably
you
could
go
up
for
manifest
disregard
review.
there
are
safeguards
in
the
process.
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
short
circuit
the
process,
and
i
think
this
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
the...
what
they
are
now
describing
as
the
threshold
issue
of
contract
formation...
contract
validity
is
not
a
threshold
issue
at
all.
it's
what
this
whole
dispute
is
about.
it
is
what
they
are
challenging
here.
they
are
saying
these
contracts
are
illegal
because
they
charge
too
much
interest,
that
what
they're
charging
is
in
fact
interest
and
that
was
illegal.
well,
they
are
now
saying
that
the...
the
court
should
decide
that
underlying
question
as
a
threshold
matter.
well,
then
there's
actually
nothing
whatsoever
left
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide,
and
they
have
effectively
vitiated
the
arbitration
agreement.
and
again--
mr.
christopher
landau
--well,
your
honor,
i...
i
guess
maybe
it
depends
on
how
you
look
at
the
word
threshold.
i
mean,
i
would
think
that
that
is
the
core
issue
in
the
dispute.
i
mean,
certainly
there...
you
are
absolutely
right
that
there
could
be
some
ancillary
issues
like
damages.
but
clearly,
the...
the
nub,
the
crux
of
their
challenge
here
is
a
challenge
to
the
legality
of
the
underlying
contract.
and
under
their
view,
they
get
to
obtain
judicial
resolution
of
that
issue
in
the
first
instance,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
don't
dispute
that
they
agreed
to
arbitrate
all
issues
relating
not
only
to
the
validity
of
the
arbitration
clause
itself,
but
relating
to
the
underlying
contract.
so
there's
no
question
here...
and
i
think
this
is
really
important
not
to
lose
sight
of...
that
this
dispute
falls
within
the
plain
language
of
their
arbitration
provision.
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
42,
the
arbitration
provision
here
is
very
broadly
worded
in
this
regard,
and
the
parties
clearly
agreed
to
do
it.
the
only
question
is
basically
whether
the
state
could
frustrate
the...
the
plain,
express
intent
of
the
parties
by
saying,
oh,
well,
this
challenge
implicates
arbitration...
implicates
legality.
mr.
christopher
landau
the...
i
think
the
argument,
your
honor,
would
be
the
same.
it's
just...
it's
a
particularly
stark
illustration
here
of
the
dangers
of
the...
of...
of
that
position.
it
may
not...
you're
absolutely
right.
it
may
not
always
be
the
case
that
the...
that
the
challenge
to
the
contract
is
going
to
be
the
merits
dispute
in
itself,
but
i
think
where,
as
here,
it
is,
it
really
shows
how
pernicious
this
rule
is
and
precisely
why
the
prima
paint
rule,
which
again
has
been
in
effect
almost
40
years
now...
why
that
approach
works
and
actually
promotes
the
policy
supporting
arbitration.
and
when
you...
again,
when
you
think
of
an
alternative
rule,
it's
one
in
which
you
could
come
in...
the
party
who
has
concededly
agreed
to
an
arbitration
clause
and
says,
well,
i
think
the
underlying
contract
is
void
on
public
policy
grounds,
which
again
you
can
make
in
virtually
any
case.
under
the
florida
supreme
court's
rationale
in
this
court...
in
this
case,
that
is
a
basis
for
remaining
in
court,
and--
mr.
christopher
landau
--your
honor,
you...
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
in
this
case,
they
have
not
challenged
the
arbitrator.
the
reason--
mr.
christopher
landau
--your
honor,
i
don't...
i
think
that's...
again,
that...
if
you
were
to
have
a
presumption
that
the
arbitrator
is
always
in
favor
of
upholding
a
contract,
that
would
seem
somewhat
in
tension
at
the
very--
mr.
christopher
landau
--oh,
yes.
mr.
christopher
landau
oh,
i'm
sorry.
then
yes.
mr.
christopher
landau
you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
that
is
absolutely
clear.
and...
and
again,
i
would
think
he
would
not
have
an
interest
in...
in
saying
that
a
contract
for
murder
is
perfectly
valid.
you're
absolutely
right.
it
wouldn'
t
get
him
more
money
in
his
pocket
and
it
certainly
would,
i
think,
lead
to
the
reputation
of
a
rogue
arbitrator
out
there
who
is
not
to
be
trusted.
and...
and
presumably
that
person
wouldn't...
wouldn't
get
much
business.
again,
so
i
think
that
the
key
point
here
is
that
the
respondents
have
tried
to
create
a
lot
of
state
law
issues
regarding
void,
voidable.
and...
and
i
think
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
the
problem
is
it's
kind
of
like
trying
to
put
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole,
that
whether
something
is
void
or
voidable
under
state
law,
which
may
vary
from
state
to
state,
kind
of
misses
the
whole
point
which
is
the
genius
of
a
federal
separability
rule
is
we
don't
care
about
those
state
law
issues.
you
don't
have
to
get
into
that
bog
to
decide
the
arbitrability
question
or
the...
you
know,
you
cannot
avoid
arbitration
by
simply
coming
up
with
all
those
grounds.
and
whether
it's
ground
a
for
challenging
the
underlying
contract
and
whatever
the
severability
implications
may
be
of
ground
a
or
ground
b,
the
point
is
when
you're
not
challenging
the
arbitration
clause,
it's
fair
game
to
send
you
to
arbitration,
and
then
you
can
raise
ground
a
or
ground
b
or
whatever
ground
you
have
before
the
arbitrator.
and
it's
simply
not
a
basis
for
avoiding
arbitration
altogether
to
be
talking
about
that.
and
again,
the...
the
point...
i
think
this
is
all
kind
of
a
common
sensical
point
that
you
want
to
get
parties
quickly
to
arbitration.
i
mean,
if
you...
if
you
have
a
situation
where
the
parties
have
to
spend
years
in
court
litigating
these
kind
of
issues,
that
really,
in
and
of
itself,
defeats
the
whole
point
of...
of
arbitration.
mr.
christopher
landau
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
and
to
the
contrary,
i
think
the
federal
arbitration
act
has
been
amended
multiple
times
since
1967
and
it
has
always
been
in
a
pro
arbitration
direction,
as
this
court
emphasized
in
the
allied
bruce
case
where
there
was
a
concerted
attack
not
on
prima
paint,
but
on
southland.
and
in
a
sense,
southland
is
really
a...
a
reflection
of
prima
paint
because
southland
simply
says
that
the...
the
substantive
federal
arbitration
law
that
was
announced
in
prima
paint
sensibly
should
not
be
limited
to
federal
court,
but
should
also
apply
in
state
court.
so
i
think
the...
the
court
faced
a
fork
in
the
road
in
prima
paint
about
the
meaning
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
was
it
just
a
procedural
provision
that
governed
in...
in
federal
proceedings
based
on
congress'
power
over
the
federal
courts
and
their
procedures?
or
was
it
a
substantive
provision
enacted
under
the
commerce
clause?
and
this
court
took
the
latter
approach
and
made
that
absolutely
crystal
clear
in...
in
southland
and
then
later
again
in
allied
bruce.
and
so
what
i
think
the
respondents
are
really
asking
you
to
do
here
is
to
really
overrule
root
and
branch
the
whole
federal
substantive
law
of
arbitrability
altogether
and
say,
well,
this
should
just
be...
you
took
the
wrong
path
back
in
1967
and...
and
you
should
just
interpret
the
faa
to
be
a...
a
procedural
statute.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
that
would
cause
an
earthquake
in
the
law
in
terms
of
arbitration
and,
therefore,
would
respectfully
urge
you
to
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
judgment.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
christopher
landau
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
three--
mr.
christopher
landau
--your
honor,
i
think
the
word
contract
is
not
a
precondition
in
the
sense
that
respondents
talk
about
in
the
sense
that
the
court
has
to
look
into
whether
it's
a
valid
contract
with
all
the
bells
and
whistles
of
state
contract
law
because
i
think
that
is
entirely
inconsistent
with
prima
paint.
i
think
the...
the
answer
is--
mr.
christopher
landau
--your
honor,
i
think
the
point
is
that
it...
the
key
part
there
is...
i
think
justice
breyer
was
getting
to
this...
that
it
has
to
be
a...
a
contract
that
evidences
interstate
commerce
to
have
the
hook
of
commerce
power
for
the
faa
to
apply
in
the
first
place.
that
was
enacted
under
the
substantive
commerce
power.
then
the
question
arises...
and
this
is
really
where
they're
hanging
their
hats
in
this
case
to
say,
well,
you
have
the
word
contract.
the
word
contract
brings
with
it
all
the
bells
and
whistles
of
state
law
for
a
valid
underlying
contract.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
looking
at
it
that
way...
i
think
this
is
the
heart
of
this
case...
that
completely
undermines...
or
the
severability
rule
says,
we've
got
a
different
contract.
the
underlying
contract
is...
is
there,
and
you
can
raise
your
challenge
to
that
contract,
but
as
long
as
you're
not
challenging
the...
the
arbitration
clause,
then
any
challenge
you
have
to
the
underlying
contract
goes
to
the
arbitrator.
and
again,
i
think
the
point
is
to
say
that,
well,
they
don't
deny
that
there's
a
severability
rule,
but
to
say
that
before
you
apply
the
federal
severability
rule,
you
have
to
go
and
look
at
the
underlying
contract
and
ascertain
all
this
is
to
deny
the
federal
severability
rule.
mr.
christopher
landau
no.
mr.
christopher
landau
i...
i
think
you're...
you're
right,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think
the...
the
point
is
it...
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
to
say
that
you
have
to
go
through
all
the
bells
and
whistles
of
looking
at
the
validity
of
the
underlying
contract
if
the
whole
point
of
prima
paint...
i
think
this
goes
back
to
what
the
chief
justice
said
is
you
just
look
at
the
arbitration
provision
as
a
severable
contract.
so
to
say
that--
mr.
christopher
landau
--you're
right,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
key
point,
that
to
say
that
the...
you
have
to
go
to
the...
the
validity
of
the
underlying
contract
under
state
law
and
the
severability
implications
of
the
challenge
to
the
underlying
contract
before
you...
before
you
even
get
to
the
arbitration
clause
is
essentially
to
negate
the
severability
of
the
arbitration
clause
because
the
whole
reason
you're
looking
at
the
underlying
contract
is
presumably
to
see
whether
or
not
the
arbitration
clause
can
fall.
so
they
cannot
logically
have
a
regime
that
says
the
arbitration
clause
is
severable
from
the
underlying
contract.
mr.
christopher
landau
and
you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor,
and
that
was
the
lines
that
were
drawn
in
prima
paint.
that...
that
was
the...
the
real
issue
that
was
presented.
they
said
there
was
no
contract.
they
said
i'm
bringing
a
rescission
suit.
and
if
you
read
what
justice
black
said
in
dissent
in
prima
paint,
he
said
there
was
no
contract.
and
this
kind
of
goes
back
to
what
justice
ginsburg
was
saying,
that
to
talk
about
the
implications,
the
severability
implications,
of
particular
challenges
under
state
law
misses
the
point
that
the
federal
severability
rule
doesn't
depend
on
state
law.
mr.
christopher
landau
thank
you.
