does
that
include
a
quarrel
over
offer
and
acceptance?
justice
anthony

i'm...
we're
trying
to
explore
the...
the
meaning
of...
of
this...
of
this
assent.
i
know
there
are
going
to
be
hard
cases,
but
i
want
to
try
to
see
how
we
describe
this
area
where
it
is
for
the
court.
justice

m.

what
about
offer
and
acceptance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
misinterpreted
my
letter.
it
was
not
an
acceptance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's...
it's
a
little
odd
that--

it's
a
little
odd
that
the
way
our
cases
have...
have
worked
out
is
that
we
assume
there's
two
contracts,
one
for
arbitration
and
the
other
for
the
rest
of
the
contracts.
that's...
that's
the
way
we've
rationalized
these
cases.
it
seems
a
little
odd
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
prima
paint
certainly
displaced
the
states
and
state
law
from
this
area
in
a
very
substantial...
to
a
very
substantial
extent.
i'm
curious
now.
have
there
been
any
attempts
in
congress
to
overrule
prima
paint?
