chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
buckeye
check
cashing
v.
cardegna.
mr.
landau.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you...
you
concede,
though,
that
if...
if
the
challenge
to
the
underlying
contract
implicates
the
arbitration
clause
as
well,
that
that
is
for
the
court
and
not
the
arbitrator.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
know,
you
put
a
gun
to
the
person's
head
and
say,
sign
this
contract,
and
the
person
does.
it
contains
an
arbitration
clause.
they
don't
have
to
go
to
arbitration
to
challenge
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what...
what's
wrong
with
the
argument
that
when
you're
dealing
with
a
void
contract,
as
opposed
to
a
voidable
one,
that
the
state
policy
is
that
you
don'
t
enforce
any
aspect
of
it?
i
mean,
if
you
and
i
had,
you
know,
a
contract
for
murder
and
it
had
an
arbitration
clause,
it'
s
pretty
strange
to
send
that
to
an
arbitrator
and
enforce
part
of
that
contract
as
opposed
to
saying
that
the
contract
as
a
whole
is
void.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
don't
do
that
with
other
provisions
of
void
contracts.
i
mean,
if
our
contract
had
a
liquidated
damages
clause...
if
you
didn't
go
ahead
and
murder
somebody,
you'd
owe
me
$1,000...
we
don't
say,
well,
that
part
is
enforceable
even
if
the
contract
as
a
whole
is
not
enforceable.
we
treat
it
as
a
whole.
because
the
subject
matter
of
the
contract
is
illegal
ab
initio,
the
whole
contract
is...
is
void
and
illegal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
usually...
do
we
usually
ask
arbitrators
to
enforce
broader
notions
of
public
policy
as
opposed
to
the
specific
agreements
of
the
party?
in
other
words,
if
the
reason
the
contract
is
void
or
voidable
has
to
do
with
broad
state
public
policy,
do
we...
what...
what's
this...
the
best
you
case
you
have
for
the
notion
that
arbitrators
enforce
those
types
of
constraints
as
opposed
to
figuring
out
what
the
parties
agreed
to?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
that's
not
true.
there
may
be
dozens
of
other
subsidiary
issues
apart
from
illegality.
they
may
say,
well,
once
you
determine
that
it's
legal,
we
think
that
we're
entitled
to
these
damages
or
those
damages
or...
or
the
rate
should
be
this
or
that.
just
because
there's
a
threshold
issue
doesn't
mean
there
aren't
other
issues
that
an
arbitrator
might
decide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
landau.
mr.
bland.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
what
they
would
say
is
that
there...
they
insist
only
that
the
agreement
be
to
arbitrate,
and
to
the
extent
there
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
they
can
enforce
section
2,
and
the
arbitrator
can
decide
whether
the
broader
agreement
is
enforceable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
almost
every
state--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--almost
ever
state
will...
has
an
exception
for
contracts
that
are
void
against
public
policy.
and
it's
just
left
to
the
creativity
of
the
lawyer
in
any
given
case
to
explain
why
a
particular
contract
is
contrary
to
public
policy.
and
you
would
allow
that
to
be
shifted
from
the
arbitrators
to
court
presumably
based
simply
on
an
allegation,
well,
the
contract
is
void,
it's
against
public
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there's
no...
but...
but
why
do
you
assume
that
that
underlying
illegality
taints
the
arbitration
clause?
i
mean,
take
the
arbitration
clause
that
you
would
find
in
a
perfectly
normal
contract,
and
if
you
put
it
in
the...
the
contract
of
the
sort
that
you're
hypothesizing,
i
don't
see
why
this
underlying
substance
of
the
contract
taints
the
enforceability
of
the
arbitration
clause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bland.
mr.
landau,
you
have
4-and-a-half
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
state
law...
the
supposition
is
that
state
law
provides
that
in
this
case,
the
usury
context,
whatever,
you
do
not
have
a
contract.
that's
the
difference
between
void
ab
initio
and
voidable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i...
his
answer
would
be,
well,
you
only
get
to
do
that
if
you're
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
the
first
place,
and
if
you
don't
have
a
contract,
then
you're
not
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
under
state
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
landau.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
scalia

opinion
