mr.
landau--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
landau,
maybe
this...
this
is
a
point
your...
the
respondent
makes.
prima
paint
talks
about
section
4
and
it
says,
with
respect
to
matters
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
so
the
answer
to
everything
you
said
could
be,
fine,
if
this
were
proceeding
in,
say,
the
southern
district
of
florida,
but
it's
in
the
state
court.
and
prima
paint
just
spoke
about
procedure
in
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
also
run
into
a
problem
with
the...
some
states
classify
a
contract
as
voidable
and
other
states
for
that
same
ground
make
it
void.
so
at
least
you
would
have...
you
would
lose
the
uniformity
if
you've
made
the
distinction
between
those
two.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be
the
issues
for
the
arbitrator
in
this
case?
is
there
anything
other
than
was
it...
was
this
interest
usurious?
the
dispute
between
the
parties...
we'
re
not
told
what
the
issues
are
that
would
be
subject
to
arbitration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bland.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bland,
some
state
may
say
fraud
in
the
inducement
is
void.
these...
these
are
classifications
that
states
make.
these
are
labels
that
the
state
puts
on
them.
and
you
are
introducing
vast
disuniformity
if
you
say
that
the
line
to
draw
is
between
void
and
voidable.
you
are
forced
into
that
because
the
prima
paint
case
dealt
with
voidable.
so
you...
that
you...
you
are
drawing
a
line
between
void
and
voidable
which
shifts
from
state
to
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
open
the
door...
if
you
open
the
door...
public
policy
has
been
called
an
unruly
horse.
all
you
have
to
do
is
open
the
door
and
you
will
have
litigation
in
court,
and
then
the
court
will
decide
what
the
arbitrator
would
other...
otherwise
decide.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
giving
the
end
result.
how
many
cases
have
the
lawyers
gone
into
court
and
said,
court,
strike
down
this
contract
because
it's
against
public
policy?
courts
may
reject
many
of
those,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
we
take--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
we
take,
mr.
bland,
what
you
said
so...
the
words
transaction
involving
commerce,
but
a
contract...
okay.
so
you
spoke
about
void
contracts.
well,
what
about
there's
not
enough
consideration,
things
that
go
to
the
formation?
so
this
contract
was
never
formed.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
we're
going
far...
far
beyond
a
void
subject
matter
like
usury.
but
you
could
say
there...
there
wasn't
sufficient
consideration.
there
was
no
mutuality
or
things
that
go
to
the
formation
of
a
contract.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
then
if
this
case,
the
case
that
was
brought
in
florida,
had
been
brought
or
removed
in...
more
likely
removed
because
there
was
diversity,
removed
to
the
federal
court,
the
federal
court
should
do
just
what
the
florida
supreme
court
did?
or
would
the
federal
court
say,
well,
we've
got
our
instructions
from
prima
paint?
it
says
excise
the
arbitration
clause.
if
that's
okay,
we
decide
the
other
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
this
was
an
issue
for
the
court.
was
there
an
alternate
forum
in
that
case?
was
it
an
arbitration
case?
