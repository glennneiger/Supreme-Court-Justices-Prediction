justice
stephen
g.

no,
no.
i
mean,
the
question
is,
i
take
it,
in
most
of
the
arbitration
associations,
once
you
have
arbitration,
you
will
get
paid
even
though...
the
arbitrator
will
be
paid,
won't
he,
whether--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
decides
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
has
no
particular
interest
in
getting
paid
in
upholding
the
contract
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
i
was
working
on
the
first
options
in
those
cases,
i
thought
there
was
from
southland
a
pretty
clear
distinction
between
whether
the
person
is
attacking
the
arbitration
clause
itself.
if
he
says
that's
not
valid,
that
probably
goes
to
the
court,
unless
there's
some
other
special
thing.
but
if
what
he's
doing
is
attacking
the
rest
of
the
contract
as
illegal,
that
doesn't.
that
goes
to
the
arbitrator.
now,
i
really
did
think
that
was
the
law.
and
even
if
i
was
wrong
in
thinking
that
was
the
law,
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
community,
the
whole
business
community
in
the
united
states
thinks
it's
the
law.
everybody
else
thinks
it's
the
law,
and
the
briefs
on
your
side
don't
even
say
that
it
isn'
t
the
law,
except
for
yours.
they
say
go
and
overrule
the
cases
that
make
it
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
logically
you're
right.
i
accept
all
that
you're
saying
logically.
you
could
make
those
distinctions,
but
you
also
could
come
out
the
other
way
logically.
and
so
to
expose
to
you
what's
really
bothering
me
about
the
case
are
two
things.
one,
i
think
you're
worried
about
consumer
contracts,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
good
arguments
on
your
side.
but
this
rule
also
applies
to
business
contracts,
and
there
what's
bothering
me
is
that...
that
the
whole
business
community
seems
to
have
developed
an
arbitration
system
throughout
the
world
that
depends
upon
the
distinction
i
just
made.
and
if
we
decide
for
you,
we're
going
to
throw
a
large
section
of
those
contracts
back
into
the
laws
of
the
50
states
and
arbitration
will
be
seriously
injured
as
the
commercial
community
has
come
to
rely
on
it.
now,
that's
what's
worrying
me
because
i
wouldn't
want
to
reach
a
decision,
in
the
absence
of
it
being
clear
anyway,
that
would
make
a
significant
negative
difference
to
the
gross
national
product
of
the
united
states,
for
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
putting
it
dramatically
because
i
want
to
get
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
what
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
not...
the
workability
of
it
depends
on
how
many
challenges
you
get
to
people
saying
this
contract
is
void,
you
know.
and
if
there
are
a
lot
of
them,
then
that
takes
a
whole
wide
set
of
cases
out
of
arbitration
and
puts
them
into
the
courts,
just
where
they're
trying
to
escape.
and...
and
so
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
how
many,
to
be
truthful,
and
i
suspect
no
one
does.
so
i'm
wondering
if
there
isn't
another
route
to
the
problem
you're
getting
at,
which
is,
as
i
think
in
other
countries,
you
say
there's
a
doctrine
of
kompetenz
kompetenz.
you
know
that?
you
know
what
i'm
thinking
of?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
arbitration
generally.
they
don't
even
look
to
see
whether
people
agreed
about
the
arbitration
clause.
it
says
arbitration.
it
goes
to
arbitration
regardless.
now,
the
safeguard
is,
a,
maybe
the
arbitrator
will
get
it
right
or,
b,
if
the
arbitrator
doesn't
get
it
right,
they
have
to
come
to
court
to
enforce
it.
and
at
that
point,
you
could
say,
you
know,
this
arbitrator
is
out
to
lunch.
our
cases
say
he
has
to
be
really
out
to
lunch,
but
you
could
make
some
distinctions
there,
you
see.
and...
and
if
this
is
really
a
problem
that
arbitrators
are
upholding
illegal
contracts,
that
might
be
the
place
to
begin
to
make
the
distinctions.
say,
judge,
look
at
this
a
little
more
closely
where
it's
illegal,
the
whole
contract,
et
cetera.
what
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
had
thought
that
the
interstate
commerce
question
was
like
crowell
v.
benson.
you
know,
it's
like
a
constitutional
fact.
and
in
fact,
if
you
can't...
if
there's
not
the
constitutional...
if
there's
not
the
connection
with
interstate
commerce,
congress,
at
least
arguably,
would
lack
the
constitutional
power
to
tell
the
state
court
what
to
do
in
this
case.
so
it's
not
as
surprising
if
there
is
a
difference
between
that
kind
of
fact
and
the
kind
of
fact
that
goes
to
whether
the...
the
contract
is
void
ab
initio.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
is.
it's
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
can
logically
because
they
say
the
arbitration
clause,
when
embedded
in
a
contract
that
is
voidable...
i.e.,
a
and
b
enter
into
a
contract.
b
says
it's
voidable.
i
void
it.
and
there
they
say,
fine,
there
was
a
contract
and
therefore
this
arbitration
clause,
which
is
separable...
you
go
to
arbitration.
but
if
it's
void,
where
b
doesn'
t
have
to
say
i
void
it,
i
void
it,
you
never
had
a
contract
in
the
first
place.
now,
that
is
a
logical
position.
