justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
a
voidable
contract.
you
could
say,
you
know,
the
whole
contract
is
voidable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
in...
in
that
respect,
a
contract
that's
void
is
no
different
from
a
contract
that's
voidable.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
arbitrator--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
the
arbitrator
decide
that
i'm...
i'm
going
to
apply
the
new
statute
rather
than
the
old
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
every
usury
case,
for
example.
that's
very
few?
i
mean,
that's
a
lot
of
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
fraud
in
the
inducement?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
get
rid
of
them
after
frustrating
the
arbitration
provision,
the
whole
purpose
of
which
is
to
keep
you
out
of
courts.
i'd
like
to...
i'd
like
to
ask
you
about
your
argument
on
section
2,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--appears
at
page
3
of
the
petitioner'
s
brief.
if
you
want
to
read
it
the
way
you're
reading
it,
you
say
a
written
provision
in
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce.
you
say
that
has
to
be
a...
a
contract
that
is
a
valid
contract.
well,
what
do
you
do
about
the
end
of
section
2
which
says,
shall
be
valid,
irrevocable,
and
enforceable,
save
upon
such
grounds
as
exist
at
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract?
that
would
apply
to...
to
contracts
that
are
not...
not
void
but
voidable.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
southland
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
you
make
that...
that
weird
distinction--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
treat
the
first
part
of
it
as
though
it
applies
across
the
board
to
the
entire
contract,
but
the
last
part
of
it,
reading
it
differently?
i...
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
even
if
you
separate
it,
you
still
have
the
language,
save
upon
such
grounds
that
exist
in
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
unless
you
take
that
language,
the
reference
to
contract
in
section
2,
as
referring
to
two
separate
things,
the
contract
without
the...
without
the
arbitration
clause
and
the
arbitration
clause
alone,
it
seems
to
me
section
2
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it...
doesn't
it
follow
from...
from
that
theory
of
yours
that
in
every
case
you
are
entitled
to
a
judicial
determination,
not
an
arbitrator's
determination,
but
a
judicial
determination
that
this
was
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
so
in
every...
every
case,
the
person
who...
who
is
being
brought
to
arbitration
can
say,
i
deny
that
interstate
commerce
is
involved
in...
in
this...
in
this
contract
and
i
want
to
have
a...
a
judicial
determination
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
question
isn't
whether
the
court
can...
can
determine
that
fact.
ultimately,
if
the
arbitrator
determines
it
incorrectly,
you
can
take
it
to
court.
but
the
question
is
whether
in
every
arbitration
case,
you
can
go
immediately
to
court
to
have
that
question
of
interstate
commerce
or
not
determined.
and
that
would
really
throw
a
monkey
wrench
into
the
whole
system,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
the
case
is
in
the
court,
of
course,
the
court
has
to
decide
that
question.
once
it
is
in
the
court.
and
it
was
in
the
court
in...
in
prima
paint.
the
question
is
does
it
have
to
go
first
to
the
court
before
it
goes
to
the
arbitrator,
and...
and
prima
paint
doesn't
decide
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
landau,
i'd
like
to
know
how
you
read
section
2.
what...
what
meaning
do
you
give
to
a
written
provision
in
a
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
guess
that
respondent
uses
the
language
in
the
way
it...
he
says
it
should
be
used
when
he
refers
to
a
contract
that
is
void
ab
initio.
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
contract
that
is
void
ab
initio,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
take
the
meaning
of
contract
that
he
takes
in
section
2.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
respondents
john
cardegna
and
donna
reuter
entered
into
various
deferred
payment
transactions
with
the
petitioner
buckeye
check
cashing,
in
which
they
received
cash
in
exchange
for
a
personal
check
in
the
amount
of
the
cash
plus
a
finance
charge.
for
each
separate
transaction,
they
signed
an
agreement
that
included
provisions
for
the
arbitration
of
disputes
arising
out
of
the
contracts.
the
respondents
brought
a
putative
class
action
in
florida
state
court
alleging
that
buckeye
charged
usurious
interest
rates
and
that
the
agreement
violated
various
florida
lending
and
consumer
protection
laws,
rendering
it
criminal
on
its
face.
buckeye
moved
to
compel
arbitration.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion,
holding
that
a
court
rather
than
an
arbitrator
should
resolve
the
claim
that
a
contract
is
illegal
and
void
ab
initio.
the
district
court
of
appeal
of
florida
for
the
4th
circuit
reversed
holding
it
because
respondents
did
not
challenge
the
arbitration
provision
itself,
but
instead
claimed
that
the
entire
contract
was
void,
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
was
enforceable,
and
the
question
of
the
contract’s
legality
should
go
to
the
arbitrator.
the
respondents
appealed,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
in
its
turn
reversed,
reasoning
that
to
enforce
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
in
a
contract
challenged
as
unlawful,
“could
breathe
life
into
a
contract
that
not
only
violates
state
law,
but
is
also
criminal
in
nature”.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
florida
supreme
court
and
affirm
that
regardless
of
whether
the
challenge
is
brought
in
federal
or
state
court,
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
contract
as
a
whole
and
not
specifically
to
the
arbitration
clause
must
go
to
the
arbitrator.
to
overcome
judicial
resistance
to
arbitration,
congress
enacted
the
federal
arbitration
act,
section
2
of
which
embodies
the
national
policy
favoring
arbitration
and
places
arbitration
agreements
on
equal
footing
with
all
other
contracts
by
providing
that
they
“shall
be
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable,
save
upon
such
grounds
as
exist
at
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract”.
our
prior
contracts
dealing
with
section
2,
notably
prima
paint
and
southland
corporation,
establish
three
propositions:
first,
as
a
matter
of
substantive
federal
arbitration
law
and
arbitration
provision
is
severable
from
the
remainder
of
the
contract;
second,
unless
the
challenge
is
to
the
arbitration
provision
itself,
the
issue
of
the
contract’s
validity
is
considered
by
the
arbitrator
in
the
first
instance;
and
third,
this
arbitration
law
applies
in
state
as
well
as
federal
courts.
the
parties
have
not
requested,
and
we
do
not
undertake
reconsideration
of
these
holdings.
applying
them
to
this
case,
we
conclude
that
because
respondents
challenged
the
agreement
but
not
specifically
its
arbitration
provisions,
those
provisions
are
enforceable
apart
from
the
remainder
of
the
contract,
and
challenge
to
their
validity
should
be
considered
by
an
arbitrator,
not
a
court.
in
declining
to
apply
prima
paint’s
rule
of
severability,
the
florida
supreme
court
relied
on
the
state
distinction
between
void
and
voidable
contracts.
prima
paint
makes
this
distinction
irrelevant.
that
case
rejected
application
of
state
severability
rules
to
the
arbitration
agreement
without
discussing
whether
the
challenge
at
issue
would
have
rendered
the
contract
void
or
voidable.
likewise,
in
southland,
which
arose
in
state
court,
we
did
not
ask
whether
the
several
challenges
made
there
would
render
the
contract
void
or
voidable.
we
simply
rejected
the
proposition
that
the
enforceability
of
the
arbitration
agreement
turned
on
the
state
legislature’s
judgment
concerning
the
forum
for
enforcement
of
the
state
law
cause
of
action.
so
also
here,
we
cannot
accept
the
florida
supreme
court’s
conclusion
that
enforceability
of
the
arbitration
agreement
should
turn
on
“florida
public
policy
and
contract
law”.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
florida
supreme
court
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
