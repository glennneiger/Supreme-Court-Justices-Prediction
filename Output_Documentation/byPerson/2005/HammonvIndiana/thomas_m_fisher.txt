mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
amy
hammon's
oral
statements
to
officer
mooney
arose
in
an
emergency
situation
very
similar
to
a
911
call,
not
in
a
situation
where
a
detective
was
attempting
to
subvert
the
judicial
system
by
developing
evidence
in
secret
with
no
intention
of
ever
letting
the
witness
testify
at
trial.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
she...
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
don't
know
about
that.
she
was--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
what
we
know
is
that
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
we're
talking
about
a
woman
who
has...
has
stated
that
she
has
suffered
a
beating
from
her
husband,
that...
a
beating
that
may
flare
up
at
any
time
if
the
officers
withdraw,
and
the
officer
needs
to
know
what
happened
so
that
he
can
properly
address
the
situation.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
it's...
the...
the
moment
to
consider
is
not
just
the
moment
when
the
officers
are
present,
but
in
fact,
what
would
happen
if
the
officers
were
to
do
nothing,
which
is
one
of
the
choices
that,
i
suppose,
the
officers
have.
they
could
find
out
what
was
going
on
and
address
the
situation,
or
they
could
withdraw,
doing
nothing,
and
then
leave
amy
hammon
to
her
own
devices
in
a
highly
explosive
situation.
they...
we
don't
know
exactly
what...
what
officer
mooney
said
when
he
went
back
into
the
living
room,
but
what
we
know
is
that
there
was
no
apparent
interrogation
of
anybody.
we
know
that
amy
hammon
at
that
point
told
him
the
story
of
the
argument
that
had
taken
place
and
the
resulting
physical
abuse.
now,
what
we
know
from...
from
the
accusation
test
that
is
put
forward
by...
by
the
petitioner
is
that
the
reason
that
it
doesn't
apply
apparently
to
all
statements
to...
to
police
officers
is
that
it
must
somehow
take
account
of
the
coconspirator
statement.
but
we
don't
otherwise
have
any
grounding
of
that
test
in
the
history
of
the
confrontation
clause.
the
test
that
we
are
proposing,
the
broader
test
that
we
are
proposing,
the
resemblance
test,
flows
directly
from
the
statements
in
crawford
suggesting
that
the
way
that
we
know
what
is
testimonial
and
what
is
not
is
by
examining
the
lessons
of
history.
what
we're
proposing
is
that
in
any
particular
context,
if
the
statement
resembles
one
of
those
historical
abuses
in
the
civil
law
tradition,
then
in
that
circumstance
it's
testimonial.
but
if
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--your
honor,
i
think
the
important
lesson
from
crawford
in
that
regard
is...
is
the
methodology,
and
the
methodology
was
let's
look
at
history.
what
does
history
tell
us
the
founders
were
concerned
about?
and
the
court
listed
the
specific
examples
of
affidavits,
depositions,
pretrial
hearings,
and...
and
expanded
that
even
to
include
interrogations.
and
in...
excuse
me...
particular
cases
coming...
coming
up,
if
there
is
evidence
that...
that
the
statements
do
correspond
to
historical
abuses,
even
if
those
abuses
were
not
listed
in
crawford,
then
that
would
be
a
different
situation.
that
would
be--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
except
that
we
do
know
that...
that
affidavits,
i
agree,
would
have
been
prohibited,
and
that's
one
of
the
classic
forms
of
testimony,
indeed,
that
was
enumerated
in
crawford
and
that
was
kept
out
at
the
founding.
and
that
falls
into
a
very
well
defined
category.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
it
ostensibly
could
be.
i
think
what
we
know,
though,
looking
back
at
what...
at
the...
at
the
raleigh
trial
and
at...
at
the...
at
the
trials
even
in
the
colonial
period,
was
that
the
founders
were
concerned
about
abuses
by
the
state,
in...
in
particular,
in
interrogations
and
in
eliciting
these
affidavits
and
in
using
pretrial
testimony.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
the
false
charges
scenario
is--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--again,
i
think
what
crawford
was
talking
about,
in
terms
of
trying
to
understand
the
confrontation
clause,
was
not
simply
to
hypothesize
various
problems
that
different
types
of
evidence
could
present
if
it
weren't
cross
examined,
but
instead
to
examine
more
particularly
what
the
founders
were
concerned
about.
and
that
was
not
one
of
the...
of
the
categories
simply--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i
think
that...
well,
certainly
it's
testimonial,
and
so--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
whether
it
would
have
come
in--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--whether
it
would
have
been
a
problem
under
the
marian
practice
i
think
is
only
part
of
the
story.
and
certainly
crawford
recognized
that
affidavits
as
a
category
were
part
of
the...
of
the
tradition
that
led
to
the
abuses
that
the
founders
were
concerned
about.
so
marian
is,
again,
part
of
the
story
but
not
necessarily
the
whole
thing.
now,
when
we
articulate
this
resemblance--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
i...
i
don't
know
that
i
would
because,
again,
you've
got
the...
you've
got
the
form
that
crawford
was
concerned
about.
the
affidavit
is
the
classic
form.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
analysis
has
to
end
there.
i
think,
for
example,
there
were
other
circumstances
where
other
types
of
communications
were
problematic.
in...
in
raleigh's
trial,
for
example,
cobham
had
submitted
a
letter,
and
that
was
recited
as
part
of
the...
the
concern.
now,
if
the
court
were
to
determine
that
a
recording
of
that
sort
was
similar
enough,
it
resembled
enough
that
sort
of
abuse,
then
yes,
it
could
be
testimonial.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
think
that
there
is
evidence
historically
that
a
letter
would
be
testimonial,
certainly
coming
out
of
cobham's
case
and...
and
other
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
it's...
it's
a
matter
of
what...
what
is
covered,
what
is
mentioned
in
history.
affidavit
is
one
of
those...
those
categories.
letters,
in
particular,
in
raleigh's
trial
was
another
area
that
may
have
been
problematic.
and
i
think--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
the...
whether
we
have
the
resemblance
test
doesn't
require
us
to
answer
that
question
because
i
think
that
the
examination
the
court
would
undertake
would
again--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i
think
it's...
i
think
it
is
very
similar
to
the
letter
and...
and
could
well
be
inadmissible,
but
i
don't
know
that
it's...
if
the
court
adheres
to
the
test
that
it
set
forth
in
crawford,
that
it's
looking
for
forms
of
testimony
that
were
prohibited
at
common
law,
certainly
that
would
not
have
been
one
of
them.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
think
that's...
that's
right.
now,
if
it's...
if
you
have
a
videotape
of
someone
that...
that's
responding
to
an
interrogation,
that's
an
entirely
different
thing.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
but
a
videotape
of
a
crime
scene
again
would
be...
would
be
not
testimonial.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
think
that
there's
a
high
chance
that
could
be...
be
excluded.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
it's
the
resemblance
test,
and
the
question--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--to
the
historical
abuses
that
the
founders
were
trying
to
address.
and
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
which
were
in
particular,
we
know,
affidavits.
we
also
know
something
about
letters,
and
the
question
with
the
tape
recording
is,
is
it
enough
like,
does
it
resemble
those
enough?
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
the
abuse
comes
not
simply
in
how
they
were
created,
but...
but
then
in
how
they
were
later
used.
and...
and
again,
we're
talking
about
trying
to...
to
craft
a
rule
in
part
that
has
some
bright
lines
to
it
based
on...
on
just
what
was...
what
form
were
not--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i
certainly
think
that
that
follows
from
the...
the
overall
test
we
propose.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
our
position
is
it's
a
corollary
to
it.
and
certainly
it's
a
narrower
test
and
applies,
i
think,
here
and
in...
in
both
cases
today,
and
it
provides
the
opportunity
to
resolve
both
cases
on
the
notion
that
when
the
officers
were
at
the
scene,
they
were
in
no
way
behaving
like
inquisitors.
they
showed
up.
they
were...
they
could...
they
were
in
the
middle
of...
of
an
abusive
situation
that
could
explode
at
any
time,
and
they
needed
to
know
what...
what
was
going
on
in
order
to
diffuse
the
situation.
so
this
case
could
be
resolved
on
that...
on
a
much
narrower
ground.
it's...
it's
important
here
also
to...
to
recognize
that
what
the...
what
the
prosecution
did
has
no...
no
similarity
to
what
would
happen
at
the
common
law.
we
have
here
the
government
issuing
a
subpoena
to
amy
hammon
to
come
and
testify
and,
obviously,
showing
that
they
would
have
preferred
the
live
testimony
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
there
was
no
such
effort,
your
honor.
but,
well,
here,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
go
beyond
the
record
just
a
little
bit,
what
we...
what
we
do
know
is
that
the
case
was
continued
one
time
because
amy
hammon
did
not
show
up
in
response
to
a
subpoena,
and
that
the
second
time,
the...
the
trial
proceeded.
but
there
was
no
effort
to
send
someone
out
to...
to
enforce
it
or
to
bring
any
sort
of
contempt
sanction.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
whether
you
look
at
it
from
her
perspective
or
from
the
officer's
perspective,
that
something
did
change
in
the
moment
between
the
oral
statement
and
the
affidavit.
if
you
look
at
it
from...
from
the
officer's
perspective,
once
amy
hammon
disclosed
to
him
what
had
happened
and...
and
gave
him
information
that
he
needed
to
handle
the
situation,
then
he
could
go
about
handling
the
situation.
he
didn't
need
the
affidavit
to
do
that.
once
he
turned
to
get
the
affidavit,
he...
he
was
transitioning
to...
less
from
an
emergency
mode
and
more
to
an
evidence
gathering
mode.
if
you're...
if
you
are
looking
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
amy
hammon,
then
at
that
point,
when...
when
officer
mooney
is...
is
in
the
house
and
has
her
husband,
you
know,
in
another
room
and
she's
trying
to
just
describe
what's
going
on
so
that
she
can
be
protected,
that's
a
far
different
mind
set.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
officers,
faced
with
an
emergency
situation,
are
primarily
going
to
be
working
for...
from
a
concern
of
safety,
for
their
own
and
for
others.
and
so
even
if
it
is
a
mixed
motive,
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
particular
circumstance,
it's
reasonable
to
infer
where
there's
an
emergency...
ongoing
emergency,
an
ongoing
immediate
safety
concern,
that
safety
and
security
are
going
to
be
the
primary
motive.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
let
me
be
clear
that
we're
not
suggesting
a
subjective
inquiry
into
the
officer's
motive,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
whether
a
statement
is
testimonial
depends
on
whether
the
government
is...
is
purely
collecting
evidence,
making
someone
undergo
an
interrogation,
for
example,
or
whether
they
are
performing
tasks
that
really
were
not
part
of...
of
any
type
of
police
function
at
the
founding,
which
is
sort
of
a
community
caretaking,
public
safety
function,
so
that
by
definition
in
eliciting
statements
concerning
the
immediate
safety
issue,
the
police
officer
could
not
have
been
engaged
in
the
kinds
of
abuses
that
gave
rise--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i'm
not
sure
if
i'm
following.
not
formality--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
again,
the...
the
difficult
task
of
understanding
the
confrontation
clause
is
to
figure
out
what
limits
there
might
be,
and...
and
in
crawford,
the
methodology
was
what
does
history
tell
us
the
framers
were
concerned
about.
and
certainly
the
formal
affidavit
was
something
that
they
were
very
concerned
about.
the
less
formal
forms
they
were
not.
and
certainly
when
it
comes
to
something
as...
as
recent,
you
know,
relatively
speaking,
as...
as
the
community
caretaking
function
of
the
police,
that
was
in
no
way
part
of...
of
the
abuses
that
the
framers
were
concerned
about.
and
so
i
think
even
if
the
court
were
to
limit
its
decision
to
that
part
of
the
test,
resolving
the
other
instances,
according
to
the
resemblance
test
or...
or
trying
to
figure
out
where
to
draw
that...
you
know,
that
line,
could
come
later,
consistent
with
its
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
if
that's
the
case.
i
mean,
i...
of
course,
they
were
operating
in
a...
in
a
circumstance
where...
where
hearsay
rules
were...
were
part
of
the
trial
process.
certainly
also,
to
the
extent
that...
that
a
particular
procedure
is...
is
outrageous,
the...
a
due
process
concern
might
arise,
but--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i
think
it
was
with
respect
to...
to
the
abuses
that...
testimony
elicited
through
the
abuses
that
gave
rise
to
the
clause,
the...
the
common...
or
i'm
sorry...
the
civil
law
type
abuses.
they
did
want
to
test
that,
but
the
concern--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i
think
that...
that
that's
largely
accurate,
but
they
were
dealing
with,
i
think,
a
rather
set
form.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
yes,
but...
but
if
i
may
add
a
clarification,
which
is
to
say,
the
reason
i
think
that
we
could
circumscribe
affidavits,
regardless
of
whether
the
elicitation
abuses
are
present,
is
simply
for
ease
of
administration,
that
abuses
known
to
the
framers
would
have
been
arising
in
the
circumstance
where
there
would
have
been
those
abuses,
and...
and
as
a--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--we
don't
know
exactly
all
of
the
details
that
would
have...
that
they
were
contemplating.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
because
of...
of
what
we
do
know
and
what
crawford
said
that
we
do
know,
which
is
that
we
know
that
they
were
responding
to
things
like
raleigh's
trial
and
to
stamp
act,
you
know,
enforcement,
other--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--again,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
finish.
the
methodology...
the
methodology
of
crawford
is
to
look
for
known
circumstances
of
abuse,
about
which
the
framers
were
concerned,
and
we
don't
have
that
sort
of
historical
evidence
more
generally.
