and
those...
those--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--such
as
in
crawford,
but
in
crawford,
it
was
the
kind
of
formal
statement,
the
court
said,
materials
such
as
affidavits,
custodial
examinations,
prior
testimony
that
the
defendant
was
unable
to
cross
examine,
or
similar
pretrial
statements.
similar
pretrial
statement
is
not
an
agitated
woman
calling
911
or
telling
a
police
officer
who...
as
in
your
case,
who
comes
in
response
to
a
call,
there's
a
disturbance
going
on
in
that
house,
get
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
legislatures
that
have
passed
laws
of
the
kind
you
describe
have
before
them
information
that
there
is
a
rather
high
incidence
of
the
victim
being
intimidated
and
therefore
not
showing
up
in
court
to
testify?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
know
why
the
or
would
necessarily
follow.
i
mean,
if
you
prevail,
there's
nothing
that
compels
the
state
to
put
money
in
what
has
been
suggested,
a
training
program,
shelters,
counselors
for
these
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nothing
at
all
compels
the
state
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
friedman,
can
i
go
back
to
your
answer
that
the
police
will
then...
in
response
to
the
position
that
you're
urging,
will
then
protect
the
victim
and
all
these
fine
things?
it
wasn't
so
long
ago
that
the
police
wouldn't
bother
with
these
prosecutions
at
all.
they
didn't
care
about
them.
and
if
you
say
you're
going
to
have
to
drag
in
the
victim,
you're
going
to
have
to
jail
her
for
contempt
if
she's
so
scared
that
she
won't
testify,
they'll
say,
who
needs
it.
we've
got
a
lot
of
other
crimes
to
prosecute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
very
powerfully
hard
to
prove,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
accept
the
government's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
isn't
the...
the
bright
line
that
the
government
asserts
that
this
is
a
crime
made
in
an
urgent
situation,
when
one
doesn't...
the
declarant
doesn't
think
rationally
will
this
be
used
eventually
in
a
trial,
where
the
declarant
wants
to
stop
an
imminent
threat?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
a
different
test
than
the
resemblance
test
that
you're
proposing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there...
was
there
any
showing
at
all
of
whether
they
made
the
police...
or
the
prosecutor
made
any
effort
to
enforce
the
subpoena?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
we
know
when
that
line
is
crossed?
you
said
reasonably
necessary
to
protect
safety.
that's
okay.
interrogation
is
not
good.
but
how...
how
does
one
tell
when
one
stops
and
the
other
starts?
