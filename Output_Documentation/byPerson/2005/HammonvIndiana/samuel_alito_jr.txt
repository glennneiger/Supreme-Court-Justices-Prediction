a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
a
statement
is
made
to
a
known
law
enforcement
officer
providing
information
that's...
that's
very
incriminating
against
somebody,
but
it
doesn't
specifically
identify
that
person?
does
that
fall
within
your
test?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
it's
an
accusation
even
though
it
doesn't
identify
the
person
who
is
alleged
to
be
the
perpetrator?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
really,
your
test
is
any
evidence
that's...
any
statement
made
to
the
police
or...
is
an...
is
testimony.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
any
relevant
evidence
given
to
law
enforcement
is
testimonial.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
somebody
calls
and
says,
i
just
saw
a
blue
toyota
with
ohio
plates
commit
a
hit
and
run,
that's
testimonial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
it's
relevant
that
jack
is
back
in
town,
then
that's
testimonial.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
people
who
are
making
all
these
statements
are...
are
to
be
understood
as
witnesses
against
somebody
within
the...
the
language
of
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
a
situation
like
that,
what
was
needed
to
resolve
the
situation,
if
he
believed
what
mrs.
hammon
said,
was
to
arrest
mr.
hammon.
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
he
could...
you
think
he
could
gather
as
much
evidence
as
was
necessary
to
arrest
mr.
hammon.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why...
why
not?
why
doesn't
that
follow?
