mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
we
are
asking
the
court
to
apply
the
same
standard
to
statements
made
to
officers
at
the
scene
as
to
statements
made
during
a
911
call.
if
the
statement
is
made
in
response
to
police
questions
that
are
reasonably
necessary
to
determine
whether
an
emergency
exists--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
affidavit
is
not
admissible.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
affidavit
is...
is
not
admissible
because,
by
that
point,
the
officer
had
the
information
that
he
needed
to
resolve
the
emergency,
and
what
he
was
soliciting
at
that
point--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
was
just
getting
to
that,
justice
stevens--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
the...
the
emergency
was
resolved,
and
at
that
point,
he
was--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no,
not...
no.
he's...
he's
not...
if
he
was
repeating
what
was
said
in
the
affidavit,
that's
a
different
point.
he's
repeating
the
statement
that
was
made
before
the
affidavit
was
given.
that
was
at
a
point
at
which
the...
there
was
still
an
immediate
danger
and
that
he
was
asking
a
question
that
was
reasonably
necessary
to
determine
whether
that
danger
existed
and,
if
so,
how
to
resolve
it.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
when...
the
immediate
danger
was--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct.
and...
and
the
problem
here
is
what
the
danger
was
what
would
happen
if
the
officers
left.
when...
when
the
officer
came
in
and
saw
a
frightened
ms.
hammon,
he
saw
wreckage
on
the
floor,
he
had
reason
to
be
concerned
that
there
was
a
very
recent
attack
on
her
and
that
if
he
left
the
scene,
that
attack
would
be
renewed.
asking
ms.
hammon
what
happened
was
reasonably
necessary
to
determine
whether
that
emergency
existed
and,
if
so,
how
to
resolve
it.
now,
once
he
had
that
information,
he
had
what
he
needed
to
resolve
the
emergency,
and
at
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
do
not.
at
some--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
at
some
point,
what...
what
turns
into
emergency
resolution
moves
over
into
interrogation,
and
once
you
reach
interrogation,
then
you
have
reached
the
core
of
what
crawford
talks
about--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i...
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
a
line
drawing
question,
but
when
you
have
a
situation
like
this
one
where
you
have
an
officer
who's
just
on
the
scene
in
the
immediate
wake
of
a...
of
a
domestic
dispute,
he
asks
a
single
question,
what
happened,
in...
in
circumstances
in
which
he
needed
to
know
the
answer
to
that
question
to
make
sure
he
could
leave
and
leave
her
there
safely.
that's
not
interrogation.
if
he
sat
around
for
a
half
hour
with
a
back
and
forth
and
give
and
take
and
trying
to
press
and
get
to
the
situation
in
that
kind
of
back
and
forth,
that
would
be
interrogation
colloquially.
and
it's...
it's
that
kind
of
line
that
the
court
is
going
to
need
to
draw.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
confrontation
clause
bars
under
crawford
police
interrogation.
and
the...
the
situation
is
one
in
which
we
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
examine
the
individual
motives
of
officers
in
every
case
and
individual
declarants
in
every
case.
what
we
are
looking
for
is
a
categorical
rule
that
is
going
to
capture
the
likely
motivations
in
both
cases,
and
when
you
have
an
emergency
question,
you're
likely
dealing
with
the
situation
with...
both
from
the
officer's
side
and
from
the
declarant's
side,
you're
going
to
be
having
people
attempting
to
resolve
an
immediate
danger
of
harm.
and
you
get--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no,
we
don't...
we
don't
think
that's
the
exclusive
focus
either,
and
we
think
interrogation
can
capture
both,
too,
that
when
you
get
to
the
point
of
interrogation,
what's
happening
with
the
witness
is
getting
an
increasing
understanding
that
what
this
is
being
sought
for
is
to
build
a
case.
i
think
the
biggest
problem
with
the...
the
two
rules
that
are
proposed
on
the
other
side,
that
is,
the
accusation
rule
and
the
reasonable
anticipation
rule,
is
it
captures
within
a...
these
emergency
statements
that
really
don't
have...
fall
within
any
ordinary
understanding
of
what
testimony
is.
if
i
go
to
my
house
and
it's
late
at
night,
i
hear
suspicious
noises,
and
i
see
somebody
and
get
a
partial
description
of
him,
and
i
call
911,
i'm
seeking
to
avert
an
immediate
danger
to
myself.
i
don't
think
under
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
anybody
would
refer
to
that
as
testimony.
yet,
under
his
rule--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no,
it
does
not.
but
what
the
court
said
in
crawford
was
that
the
term
witness
was
referring
to...
that
people
can
make
testimonial
statements--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but...
but
that's
not
the
definition
of
witness
that...
that
crawford
adopted.
that
would
be--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
scalia,
if
he--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if...
if
he...
he
had
made
a
statement
about
a
coconspirator's
statement
during
the
course
of
the
conspiracy
and
he
had
said,
we
have
here
the
testimony
of
the...
his
coconspirator,
that
would
not
make
it
testimony.
and
if
the...
the
911
call--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
it
just
does
not
make
it
testimony.
and
if
it...
the
prosecutor
in
the
911
case
had
said,
i
don't
have
her
testimony,
i
have
something
better,
it's
a
911
call--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--of
a
cry
for
help,
that
wouldn't
make
it
not
testimony.
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--he's...
he's
still
a--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--he
is
the
witness--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--he's
the...
he's
the...
he
is
subject
to
cross
examination.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
i...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
she's
not
a
witness
during
the
emergency
period
itself.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
has
to
be
both.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i...
i
think
that
that's
one
way
of
looking
at
it,
justice
stevens,
but--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
i...
i
think
that
what
you
would
look
to
see
is
if,
at
the
relevant
time,
that...
that
the
declarant
was
acting
as
a
witness.
and
at
the
relevant
time,
when
somebody
is
answering
a
question
to
avert
an
immediate
danger,
they're
not
acting
as
a
witness.
they're
not
making
a
solemn
declaration
for
the
purpose
of
proving
facts
to
support
a
prosecution,
and
so
they're
not
acting
as
a
witness
in
those
circumstances.
and...
and
it's
only
later,
when
the
officer
turns
to
soliciting
from
ms.
hammon
an
affidavit,
that
what
he's
soliciting
at
that
point
is
a
solemn
declaration
made
for
the
purpose
of
proving
facts
to
support
a
prosecution.
now,
that's
testimony.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that,
justice
scalia.
that...
that...
what
happened
is
that
he
took...
that
he
listened
to
her
oral
statement
and
then
he
proceeded
to
ask
for...
her
for
an
affidavit,
after
he
had
the
information
that
he
needed
to
resolve
the
emergency,
was
to
figure
out
how
he
was
going
to
protect
this
person
from
an
immediate
renewed
attack
if
he
left
the
scene.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it's
not
the
whole
question
because
if
the
statement...
the
question
has
nothing
to
do
with
and
the
answer
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
emergency.
it
does
not
come
in
under
the
rule
we're
talking
about.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
justice
stevens,
i'm--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i'm
happy
to
have
your
approach
if
it...
if
it
leads
to
my
approach
to
this
case.
