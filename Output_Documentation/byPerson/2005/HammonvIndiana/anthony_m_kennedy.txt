and...
and
what...
what
is
the
theory
on
which
the
statutes
are...
are
adopted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
argument
that
they
propose
to
say
it's
not
testimonial?
i
know
you
disagree
with
it,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
not
sure
what...
what
sense
it
makes.
two
cases.
the
woman
runs
out
and...
and
says,
he...
he
stabbed
me
and
i'm
dying,
he's
a
murderer.
case
one,
it's
a...
a
neighbor.
case
two,
it's
a
police
officer
and
she
sees
that
he's
a
police
officer.
why...
why
should
there
be
a
difference?
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
your
test
was
if
she
knows
that
he's
a
police
officer,
it's
testimonial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
don't
know
why
one
case
is
so
easier
than
the
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is...
let's
assume
you
had
a
completely
honest
police
officer.
you
may
have
a
motive
on
the
part
of
the
witness
to
frame
the
defendant.
i
mean,
that's
another
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
it
often
happens
that
there
are
false
charges
made
that
the...
that
the
police
believe
to
be
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
is
fully
consistent
with
prohibiting
testimonial
statements.
