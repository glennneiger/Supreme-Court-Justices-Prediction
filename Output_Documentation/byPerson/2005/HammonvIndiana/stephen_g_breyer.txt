justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when,
for
example,
there's
an
undercover
agent,
a
law
enforcement
officer...
let's
think
of
the
mafia
or
the
ku
klux
klan
reveals
himself.
one
of
the
coconspirators
during
the
ongoing
conspiracy
switches
sides.
but
no.
he
doesn't
switch.
he's
still
in
the
conspiracy.
makes
a
whole
lot
of
statements.
those
are
all
inadmissible,
though
they'd
come
in
now
because
they
would
be
in
the
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
there...
but
there's...
in
other
words,
i've
got
your
definition
and
all
i've
tried
to
do
is
create
a
circumstance
where,
while
it
fits
your
definition,
it's
made
by
a
person
that
is
in
the
conspiracy.
so
i
make
him
undercover,
the
law
enforcement
officer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
known.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
my
hypothetical
could
never
come
up.
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is...
it
seems
to
me
that
your
hypothetical
is
going
to
take
statements
that
would
come
in
that
are
pretty
far
removed
from
the
prosecution
that
are
in
odd
circumstances,
are
not
just
testimonial
at
all
in
anybody's
thought,
but
it
keeps
them
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
known.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
continuing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you've
convinced
me
i
have
a
bad
hypothetical.
[laughter]
you
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's...
what's
worrying
me
on
this
is...
i'll
tell
you
my
concern
without
the
hypothetical.
crawford
wrenches
the
confrontation
clause
free
of
the
hearsay
rule,
and
therefore,
testimony...
it
might
be
testimonial
even
though
it
is
not
hearsay
or
falls
within
an...
doesn't
fall
within
an
exception.
you
understand
what
i'm
saying.
fine.
now,
you
come
along
with
a
suggestion,
and
what
struck
me
immediately
was
that,
wait
a
minute,
can't
i
easily
think...
apparently
not
easily...
can't
i
easily
think
of
the
instances
where
it
would
be
testimonial
but
it
isn't
an
accusation
made
to
a
policeman.
and
conversely,
can't
i
easily
think...
not
easily...
of
instances
where,
well,
it
would
have
come
in,
but
it
was
statements
made
to
a
policeman
maybe
years
before,
maybe
about
this,
maybe
about
that?
maybe
it's
a
hospital
record.
maybe
it's
a
business
record.
there
are
all
kinds
of
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule,
and
they
don't
run
parallel
to
the
test
you've
just
given.
that's
what's
worrying
me.
what's
the
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
present
sense
perceptions?
that
might
be
a
good
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
apparently
803(1)
has
the
first
exception--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
the
hearsay
rule.
it's
present
sense
impression.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
on
the
phone,
somebody
is
describing
very
calmly...
very
calmly
to
the
policeman
the
terrible
crime
that
he
sees
going
on
in
front
of
him.
now,
i
gather
from
the
fact
that
it's
an...
that
it
is
a
exception,
that
now
in
the
federal
courts
that
would
be
admissible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
no.
forget
the...
yes.
every
day
of
the
week,
they
come
in.
is
that
right?
present
sense
impressions.
it's
here
as
the
first
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
it
is,
803(1).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
and
you
practiced
this
for
years.
see.
i
mean,
you're
an
expert
in
this,
and
i...
i
think
my
impression...
just
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong...
is
it's
803(1).
it
says
a
present
sense
impression
comes
in.
so
i
guess
it
does
unless
i'm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
if
we
adopt
your
rule,
a
person
calls
up
on
the
phone
and
says,
i'm
here
at
the
baseball
game,
there's
a
terrible
crime
going
on
in
front
of
me,
and
he
describes
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
the
police
officer,
that
no
longer
could
come
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
wasn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--trying
to
reduct
you
out
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
just
wanted
to
know
what
the
facts
are
about
the
rule.
i
was
just...
that's
what
i
was
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
a
second
choice
rule?
i
mean,
we
have
professor
amar,
who
has
pretty
formal
criteria.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
the
rule
that
you
just
enunciated,
and
i
don't
want,
before
you
sit
down,
to...
i
want
to
find
out
if
you
have
an
intermediate
position,
a
fall
back
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
the
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
resemblance
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
were?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
this
is
helpful,
very
helpful
to
me,
but
i'm
trying
to
see
what
you're
driving
at.
i'm
imagining
the
woman
saying,
he's
hitting
me,
he's
just
hit
me.
she's
in
tears.
that's
excited
utterance.
not.
then
suddenly
the
officer,
5
minutes
later,
says
i've
heard
what
you
said.
let's
reduce
it
to
writing.
here's
the
formal
affidavit,
et
cetera,
that
is...
but
to
prevent
mr.
friedman's
problem,
we're
going
to
have
to
say
as
to
the
second,
that
is
even
if
you
don't
have
the
formality,
you
see,
everything
is
the
same,
but
not
the
formality.
now,
how
do
we
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
making
the
distinction
you're
making
between
she's
in
tears,
excited
utterance
or
res
gestae,
around
there,
just
what
you
were
talking
about.
now
think
of
the
second
affidavit...
when
he
reduces
it
to
writing.
that's
different,
calmer,
clearly
motive
to
testify,
et
cetera.
fine.
but
now
what
mr.
friedman
pointed
out
is
if
we
make
it
turn
solely
on
the
formality,
the
piece
of
paper,
the
stamp,
et
cetera,
they'll
just
avoid
that.
so
we're
going
to
have
to
sweep
into
the
second
the
circumstance
where
everything
is
the
same
but
the
formality,
and
that's
where
i
have
the
difficulty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because
he
might
be
interrogating
with
no
idea
at
all
primarily
in
his
mind
of
later
court
appearance.
he
wants
to
find
out
if
there
are
guns
in
the
house.
he
wants
to
find
out
if
there
are
other
people
in
the
house.
he
wants
to
find
out
if
somebody
is
being
held
captive.
he
wants
to
find
out
if
these
are
the
same
people
who
did
some
other
crimes
immediately
taking
place,
what's
the
relationship.
there
are
all
kinds
of
interrogation.
you're
saying
that
all
that
interrogation
by
a
policeman
can't
come
in
under
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
resemblance
idea
to
get
around
your
problem?
of
course,
it's
not
purely
formal.
it's
purely
formal,
plus
those
things
that
resemble
what's
purely
formal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
purely
the
formal
criteria,
plus
anything
that's
the
same.
now,
same
is
vague,
but
it's
no
vaguer
than
a
lot
of
other
things
floating
around
here
today.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
do
you
think
of
that?
