justice
antonin
scalia
statutes
that...
that
say
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
we...
we...
that...
that
quotation
was
a...
a
description
of
what
crawford
described
as
the
core.
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
not
the
totality
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you...
you
have
to
assume
not
only
that
the
victim
is
unwilling
or
reluctant
to
testify,
you
have
to
assume
that
the
victim
has
disappeared
because
the
victim,
unwilling
or
not,
could
be
subpoenaed.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i'm
saying
the
scope
of
the
problem
is...
is
much
more
narrow
than
what
is
suggested
by
simply
describing
how
often
it
is
that
the...
that
the
complaining
witness
is
reluctant
to
testify.
that
doesn't
stop
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
reluctant
or
not,
that
witness
can
be...
can
be
subpoenaed.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
point,
i
thought,
was
that
that
would
be
the
incentive
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
police
departments,
of
course--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
they
want
to
make
their
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
should
hope
not.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--edmund
burke
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
wouldn't
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
criminal...
this
is
a
pretrial
hearing
on
whether
the...
the...
there's
been
intimidation.
couldn't
the
judge
just
find
it
more
likely
than
not
that
the
defendant
has
intimidated
a
witness?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
a
911
operator
who
was
an
agent
of...
of
the
police.
justice
antonin
scalia
she's
sitting
down
at...
at
a
table,
as
i
recall
it,
with
the...
with
the
police
officer
on
the
other
side
of
the
table.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
a
cup
of
coffee.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
there
was
a
cup
of
coffee,
too.
maybe...
i
don't
know
where
i
got
that
from.
maybe
i
made
it
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
seem
to
me
a
terribly
emergency
situation
in...
in
that
kind
of
a
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
time,
the
officer
is
right
there
in
the
house.
there's
certainly
no
emergency
at
the
time.
now,
you
could
say
that...
that
the
woman
is
frightened
about
a
recurrence,
but
if...
if
that's
your
definition
of
an
emergency,
it's
going
to
cover
an
awful
lot
of
situations.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
was
the
only
concern
of
the
founders,
i
mean,
the...
the...
you
know,
the...
the
fact
that...
that
the
state
could
corrupt
the...
the
statement
through
the
interrogation.
i'm
not
sure
that
was
the
only
concern.
i...
i
think
the
founders
believed
in
a
judicial
system,
at
least
in
criminal
cases,
where
the
person
has
a
right
to
cross
examine
his
accuser.
whether
the
fact
that
the...
i
am...
i'll
put
it
this
way.
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
would
have
been
held
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause
if,
as
the
prior
example
i
gave,
someone
wrote
out
an
affidavit
and
sent
it
directly
to
the
court,
no
intervening
police
interrogation
at
all,
just
wrote
out
an
affidavit
from...
from
france,
mailed
it
to
the
court,
and
the
court
has
this
affidavit.
i
am
sure
that
would
be
a
smack
bang
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause.
and
there's
none
of
the...
the
abuse
that...
on...
on
which
you...
you
would
hinge
the
entirety
of
the
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
leave
that,
surely
the
affidavit
isn't...
isn't
what's
magical.
i
mean,
i'm
going
to
change
my
hypothetical.
the
person
recites
his
accusation
on
a
tape
recorder
and
mails
the
tape
to
the
court.
now,
are
you
going
to
say,
well,
it's
not
an
affidavit?
you'd
exclude
that
as
well,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
make
no
sense
at
all.
i
mean,
that...
that
is
just
the
worst
sort
of
formalism.
if
you
do
it
in
an
affidavit,
it's...
it's
bad,
but
if
you
put
it
on
a
tape,
it's...
it's
good.
i...
i
cannot
understand
any
reason
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
assume
your...
you
have
here
a
woman
who's
sitting
down
in
the
kitchen
with
the
police
officer,
talks
to
the
police
officer,
and
then
signs
an
affidavit.
did
she
sign
the
affidavit
at
that
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
affidavit
was
not
admissible
because
it's
an
affidavit.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
police
officer
who
testified
to
what
she
said
and
what
he
wrote
down
in
the
affidavit
that
she
signed,
that
does
get
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
can't
see
why
that
makes
any
sense
at
all.
i
mean,
she...
she
was
either
testifying
when
she
spoke
and
then
signed
the
affidavit,
as
evidence
of
her
testimony,
or...
or
else
she
wasn't
testifying,
in
which
case
both
the
affidavit
and
the
oral
statement
should
be
in.
i
can't...
i
can't
see
drawing
the
line
between
those
two.
it
really
seems
very
strange
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
his
motive
matter?
i
mean,
the...
the
issue
is
whether
she
is
testifying,
whether
she
is
a
witness,
and
i
don't
see
how
that
changes
when
she
tells
him
these
things
orally
and
when
she
signs
the
affidavit
afterwards.
it
seems
to
me
she's
testifying
as
to
what
events
had
occurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
immediate
danger?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there's
the
policeman
in
the
room
across
the
kitchen
table
from...
from
the
woman.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
on
the
end
of
a
phone
line.
he's
in
the
room
across
the
kitchen
table.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
assumes...
this...
your...
your
focus
on
whether
the...
you
know,
the...
it's
an
interrogation
or
not...
it...
it
assumes
that
the
only
focus
of
the
confrontation
clause
is
on
prosecutorial
abuse
somehow.
and...
and
as...
as
justice
souter
was
suggesting,
i
don't
think
that
was
the
exclusive--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
it
happens
in
the
other...
in
the
companion
case
today,
the
prosecution
itself,
in
its
summation
to
the
jury,
referred
to
the
911
call
and
said,
you
have
heard
the
testimony
of...
of
the
victim
and
referred
to
it
as
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
not
beyond
the
pale
to
consider
this
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
would
prove
that...
that
it's
not
beyond
the
pale
to
call
it
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
the
two
were...
were
as
separated
as
you...
as
you
claim.
i...
i
took
it
that
the
affidavit...
while
he
was
getting
the
oral
responses,
he
was
writing
down
what...
what
would
be
put
in
the
affidavit.
justice
antonin
scalia
it’s
me
again.
these
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
respectively.
the
question
before
us
in
both
cases
is
whether
the
admission
of
out-of-court
statements
violated
the
sixth
amendment’s
confrontation
clause,
which
states,
“in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him,”.
the
facts
of
each
case
described
in
brief
are
as
follows.
in
the
first
of
them,
davis,
a
911
operator
received
a
frantic
call
from
michelle
mccottry,
who
was
involved
in
an
ongoing
domestic
disturbance
with
davis,
her
former
boyfriend.
the
operator
asked
mccottry
a
number
of
questions
to
determine
what
was
happening
and
some
questions
about
davis
to
determine
whether
the
dispatched
police
officers
would
be
dealing
with
a
dangerous
felon.
at
some
point
during
the
911
call,
davis
apparently
left
mccottry’s
home.
police
arrived
on
the
scene
within
four
minutes
of
the
call.
the
state
of
washington
charged
davis
with
felony
violation
of
a
domestic
no-contact
order.
at
trial,
only
the
police
who
arrived
on
the
scene
after
davis
had
left
testified;
mccottry
herself
did
not.
but
the
prosecutor
offered
a
recording
of
the
911
call,
which
identified
davis
as
the
assailant
and
which
was
admitted
over
davis’s
confrontation
clause
objection.
the
jury
convicted
him,
the
washington
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
as
did
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
which
held
that
mccottry’s
statements
were
nontestimonial.
in
the
other
case,
hammon,
a
domestic
disturbance
call
led
police
to
the
home
of
hershel
and
amy
hammon.
they
found
amy
sitting
on
the
front
porch.
she
told
them
that
nothing
was
wrong,
but
they
asked
for
and
received
amy’s
permission
to
enter
the
home.
inside,
they
observed
a
living
room
showing
signs
of
an
altercation,
including
a
broken
heater.
hershel,
amy’s
husband,
was
sitting
alone
in
the
kitchen.
the
officers
asked
him
what
had
happened,
he
told
them
that
he
and
his
wife
had
had
a
disagreement,
but
that
it
never
became
physical.
at
some
point,
amy
came
back
inside
and
went
into
the
living
room.
one
of
the
officers
stayed
with
hershel
in
the
kitchen
while
the
other
went
to
ask
amy
about
the
night’s
events
once
more.
this
time,
she
described
the
altercation
in
some
detail,
saying
that
it
began
over
a
dispute
about
their
daughter,
that
it
evolved
from
being
verbal
to
being
physical,
that
hershel
started
breaking
things,
that
he
threw
her
down,
shoved
her
and
punched
her.
after
hearing
her
story,
the
officer
asked
her
to
write
it
out
on
a
battery
affidavit,
a
regular
form
that
this
police
department
had,
and
to
sign
that
affidavit,
which
she
did.
the
state
of
indiana
charged
hershel
with
domestic
battery.
amy
did
not
appear
at
the
subsequent
trial.
although
hershel
objected
on
confrontation
clause
grounds,
amy’s
statements
about
the
events
in
question
were
admitted,
both
through
the
testimony
of
the
officer
who
had
questioned
her
and
through
the
battery
affidavit
that
she
had
signed.
hershel
was
convicted.
the
indiana
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
as
did
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
it
concluded
that
although
the
affidavit
was
testimonial
and
had
been
wrongly
admitted,
it
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
officer’s
testimony
about
amy’s
oral
statements
to
him,
on
the
other
hand,
the
indiana
supreme
court
held
were
not
testimonial.
we
granted
certiorari
in
both
cases,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
davis
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
in
hammon.
in
a
2004
case
called
crawford
versus
washington,
we
held
that
the
confrontation
clause
bars
the,
“admission
of
testimonial
statements
of
a
witness
who
did
not
appear
at
trial
unless
he
was
unavailable
to
testify
and
the
defendant
had
had
a
prior
opportunity
for
cross-examination,”
which,
of
course,
did
not
exist
in
either
of
these
cases.
we
hold
today,
as
we
implied
in
crawford,
that
the
confrontation
clause
extends
only
to
statements
that
are
testimonial.
that
is
clear
from
the
text
of
the
clause,
which
requires
confrontation
of
witnesses.
“witnesses”
are
those
who
bear
testimony.
none
of
the
cases
exemplifying
the
confrontation
requirement
at
the
time
of
the
framing
applied
to
nontestimonial
hearsay,
such
as
a
victim’s
cries
for
help.
to
be
sure,
most
of
those
early
cases
involved
testimonial
statements
of
the
most
formal
sort,
such
as
sworn
testimony
in
prior
judicial
proceedings
or
formal
dispositions
under
oath;
but
not
all
of
them
did.
we
do
not
think
it
conceivable
that
the
clause’s
protections
can
be
evaded
by
having
a
policeman
recite
a
defendant’s
unsworn
testimony
rather
than
the
policeman’s
having
the
declarant
sign
a
deposition
to
the
same
substantive
effect.
in
davis,
therefore,
we
must
ask
whether
objectively
considered
the
interrogation
that
took
place
in
the
course
of
the
911
call
produced
testimonial
statements.
we
conclude
that
it
did
not.
911
calls
are
ordinarily
designed
to
describe
current
circumstances
that
require
immediate
police
assistance.
this
case
is
no
different.
mccottry
was
trying
to
obtain
help
to
meet
an
ongoing
emergency;
she
was
not
acting
as
a
witness.
she
was
speaking
in
the
present
tense
about
events
as
they
were
actually
happening,
not
reporting
on
events
that
were
done.
objectively
viewed,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
911
operator’s
interrogation
was
to
enable
police
assistance
to
meet
the
ongoing
emergency.
in
hammon,
by
contrast,
the
statements
were
testimonial.
in
relevant
respects,
they
were
not
much
different
from
those
that
we
held
to
be
testimonial
in
crawford.
there
was
no
ongoing
emergency.
the
police
quite
properly
conducted
an
investigation
into
whether,
as
they
suspected,
past
events
of
a
criminal
nature
had
occurred.
such
an
investigation
required
them
to
ask
amy
to
tell
them
what
had
happened
so
that
they
could
decide
whether
to
arrest
hershel,
not
to
end
an
emergency
that
was
in
progress.
objectively
viewed,
the
primary,
if
not
the
sole,
purpose
of
the
interrogation
in
that
case
was
to
investigate
a
possible
crime.
from
the
perspective
of
the
sixth
amendment’s
text
again,
witnesses
in
court
narrate
and
attest
to
the
truth
of
past
events,
which
is
precisely
what
amy
hammon
did.
to
summarize
our
holdings
in
these
cases,
statements
are
nontestimonial
when
made
in
the
course
of
police
interrogation
under
circumstances
objectively
indicating
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
interrogation
is
to
enable
police
assistance
to
meet
an
ongoing
emergency.
they
are
testimonial
when
the
circumstances
objectively
indicate
that
there
is
no
such
ongoing
emergency
and
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
interrogation
is
to
establish
or
prove
past
events
potentially
relevant
to
later
criminal
prosecution.
finally,
we
again
emphasize,
as
we
did
in
crawford,
we
will
note
that
both
of
the
abused
spouses
in
these
cases
did
not
testify,
which
is
not
an
unusual
phenomenon.
for
that
reason,
we
again
emphasize,
as
we
did
in
crawford,
that
while
the
prosecution
may
not
deprive
a
defendant
of
the
right
to
confrontation,
a
defendant
may
forfeit
that
right;
for
example,
by
procuring
or
coercing
the
absence
of
a
witness.
the
doctrine
of
forfeiture
by
wrongdoing
is
an
established
equitable
principle
necessary
to
allow
courts
to
protect
the
integrity
of
their
proceedings.
on
remand,
the
indiana
courts
may,
if
they
are
asked,
determine
whether
a
claim
of
forfeiture
is
properly
raised
and,
if
so,
whether
it
is
meritorious.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
is
affirmed,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
is
reversed,
and
the
latter
case
is
remanded
for
proceeding
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
davis
and
dissenting
in
hammon.
