mr.
richard
d.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
court
can
decide
these
cases,
as
it
decided
crawford
without
testing
the
outer
bounds
of
the
confrontation
clause,
by
adopting
a
simple
proposition
that
is
easily
understood
by
and
intuitively
sensible
to
ordinary
lay
people
and
so
capable
of
being
passed
on
from
generation
to
generation
as
one
of
the
cornerstones
of
our
fundamental
liberties.
a
criminal
conviction
cannot
be
based
on
an
accusation
made
privately
to
a
known
law
enforcement
officer.
if
the
state
wishes
that
such
an
accusation
be
presented
in
support
of
a
conviction,
then
it
must
ensure
that
the
accuser
testifies
in
the
manner
long
required
by
the
common
law
system
of
criminal
justice,
in
the
presence
of
the
accused,
under
oath,
and
subject
to
cross
examination.
as
in
crawford,
the
court
does
not
need
to
offer
a
comprehensive
definition
of
the
term
testimonial.
it
is
enough
to
say
that
an
accusation
to
a
known
law
enforcement
officer
must
be
testimonial
under
any
plausible
definition.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
statements
in
furtherance
of
a
conspiracy,
if
i
understand--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--if
it's
an
undercover
law
enforcement--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--by...
by
known,
i
mean
to
the
declarant.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
by
known,
i
mean
to
the
declarant.
so
if
it's--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--if
it's
an
undercover
agent
and
so
it's
a
statement
to
an
undercover--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i...
i'm
afraid
i...
i
don't
fully
understand
the
hypothetical.
if
the...
if
the
officer
is
not
known
to
the
declarant
as
a
law
enforcement
officer,
then
there's
no
problem.
then...
then
the
statement
could--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--if
he's...
he's
known
to
the
law
enforcement
officer
and
the
member
of
the
conspiracy
is
making
a--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--it's
a
continuing
conspiracy,
but...
but
that
statement
to
the
law
enforcement
officer
saying
that
somebody
else
in
the
conspiracy
has
committed
a
crime,
would
not,
in
fact,
be
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
it
would
blow
the
conspiracy
apart.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i...
i
don't
think
it's...
your
honor,
i
feel
duty
bound
to
say
there
are
no
bad
hypotheticals,
but
there
are...
there
are
easy
ones,
and
i
think
if...
if
it's
a
known
officer...
it's...
in
that
situation,
it's
going
to
be
accusatorial.
if
it's
not
a
known
officer,
it's...
it's
not--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i...
i
believe
it
does.
of
course,
in
this
case
we
have
both,
a
description
of
the
crime
and
an
identification
of
the
perpetrator.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
we
could
call
it
what
we
will.
i
think...
i
think
that
it
still
would
be
within
the
narrow
proposition
that
we're
advocating
that
a...
that
a
description
of
the
crime
to
a
known--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
it...
it
either
has
to
describe
the
crime
or
identify
the
perpetrator
or,
as
in
this
case,
do
both.
so--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--well,
when
you
say...
when
you
say
relevant,
i
think
that
if
the
law
enforcement
officer...
if...
if
it's
a
statement
to
a
known
law
enforcement
officer
in
the
line
of
duty,
it's...
it's
almost
always
going
to
be
testimonial.
if
it...
if
it
identifies
the...
the
perpetrator
or
describes
the
crime,
i
would
say
it's
clearly
testimonial,
or
if
it's
in
response
to
the...
to
the
officer's
inquiries,
it's
clearly--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i
believe...
i
believe
so.
now...
now,
in
fact,
that
would
provide
some
identifying
information
because
it
is
a
person
who
is
associated
with
that
blue...
with
that
blue
toyota.
but
if
it's
simply
a
officer
in
the
donut
shop,
i
just
saw
jack,
he's
back
in
town,
with
no
clear
relation
to
any...
any
crime,
that's
presumably
just
chatter
and
that
wouldn't
be
testimonial
even
if
it...
even
if
it
later
becomes
relevant.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
if...
if
at
the
moment
that
it's
made,
the
declarant
understands
that
jack
being
back
in
town
might
be
useful
in
an
investigation,
or
if
a
reasonable
person
in
the
position
of
the
declarant
would
understand
it,
that
would
be
testimonial.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
so
the...
the
basic
principle
for
which
we're
advocating
does
not
lie
at
the...
outside
of
the...
of
the
definition
of
testimonial.
i
think
it's
simply
a
core
proposition.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i
think
within
the...
within
the
meaning
of
the
confrontation
clause,
if
those
statements
are
allowed
at
proof...
as
proof
at
trial
without
the
person
coming
in,
then
what
we
have
essentially
done
is
created
a
system
by
which
people
can
create
evidence
for
use
by
the
legal
system,
by
engaging
those
statements
without
coming
into
court.
that's...
that's
right.
and
so
i
think
one
of
the
critical
factors
here
is
to
imagine
what
happens
if
statements,
such
as
the
ones
in...
in
this
case,
are
admitted...
are
admissible,
and
this
court
holds...
holds
that
they
are,
then
basically
they
always
can
be
admitted.
then
any
state
is
free
to
create
a
system
in
which
a
statement
to
a
responding
officer
comes
in
as
proof.
there's
no
need
for
the...
for
the...
the
declarant
to
show
up
at
trial,
and
there's
no
doubt
that...
that
that
is
what
would
happen.
california
and
oregon
have
already
adopted
such
statutes,
and...
and
my
state
of
michigan
is
on
the
verge
of
doing
so.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
that
say...
that
say
accusations
to
a...
made
to
a
law
enforcement
officer,
in
the
case
of
oregon
and
the
pending
michigan
bill,
accusations
of
domestic
violence
are
admissible
so
long
as
they
are
made
reasonably
freshly...
but
they
give
a
24-hour
time
frame...
they...
they
are
admissible.
no
need
for
excitement.
so...
so
the
idea
that...
that
the
jurisdictions
have
limited
this
to...
to
excited
utterances
is...
is
not...
is
not
so.
if...
if
the
court
affirms
the
decision
here,
i
think
the
message
would
go
out
that
these...
that
these
statutes
are
perfectly
okay.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
the--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--justice
kennedy,
the...
i
don't
think
there
is
a
theory.
and
i
say
that
quite
seriously.
i...
i
actually
testified
last
month
before
the
michigan
house
on
the...
the
bill
saying
i
believe
this
bill
is
blatantly
unconstitutional.
i
believe
it's
going
to
be
held
unconstitutional
within
a
few
months.
there
was
not
a
high
level
of
interest
in
the
constitutional
argument
before
the
legislature.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
theory.
i
think
the...
i
think
the
theory
is
that
prosecutors
say
that
these
would
be
good
laws
to
pass.
so--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--your
honor,
let...
let
me
be
very
clear.
we
do
not
propose
that
this
categorical
principle
that
an
accusation
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
is
a
definition
of
what's
testimonial.
we
regard
this
as
a
core
category
of
testimonial
statements
such
as
the
core
categories
that
the
court
listed
in
crawford.
so...
so
if
a
statement
fits
within
that...
within
that
category,
that
is
sufficient
to
make
it
testimonial.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
i...
i
understand,
justice
ginsburg.
of
course,
crawford
was
only
listing
a
non
exclusive
list
of...
of
core...
of
core
categories.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
certainly
not
the
totality,
and
if
you
say,
well,
this
statement
was
informal,
it...
it
doesn't
make
sense
and
i
think
it
conflicts
with
a
comment
in
crawford
in
footnote
3
to
say,
well,
informal
testimony
is...
is
okay,
as
the
court
said
in...
in
crawford.
if...
if
sworn
out
of
court
testimony
is
invalid,
it
wouldn't
make
sense
to
say
that
unsworn
testimonial
statements
are
perfectly
okay.
now,
so
far
as
the
principle
that...
that
because
the
witness
is
under
agitation,
the...
the
confrontation
clause
doesn't...
doesn't
apply,
i
don't
think
that's...
that's
valid
at...
at
all.
it
certainly
isn't
valid
historically.
if...
if
it
were,
we
would
have
seen
examples
over
history
in
which
agitated
declarants...
their
statements
came
in.
but
as...
as
general
dreeben
has
indicated,
the
very...
the
very
organizing
principle
of
prosecution
was
that
the
accuser
must
come
and...
come
and
testify.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
your...
your
honor,
in
the...
in
the
old
bailey
sessions
papers
there
were
approximately
2
percent
of
the
cases,
the
victim
who
was
the
prosecutor
did
not
show
up.
it
was
a
recurring...
a
recurring
matter.
why
they
didn't
show
up
may
have
been
for
various
reasons.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
state
in
the
very
first
paragraph
of
its
brief
emphasizes
that
there
are
numerous
reasons
why,
in
the
domestic
violence
context,
the...
the
accuser
may
not
testify
in
court.
and
in
those
roughly
2
percent
of
all
the
cases,
which
is
2,000
cases,
in
not
a
single
one...
well,
i'm
sorry.
there
was
one
in
which
there
was
a...
a
conviction.
that's
because...
because
the
defendant...
because
the
defendant
confessed.
but
in
all
the
others,
the
accusation
was...
the...
the
case
was
summarily
dismissed.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
the...
the
victim
could
be
subpoenaed,
and
in...
in
this
case,
as
in
davis,
the
victim
was
subpoenaed,
but
subpoenas
have
to
be
enforced.
and...
and
i
think
in
some
cases
the
prosecution
does...
simply
doesn't
enforce
the
subpoenas.
it's
what
was
the
cook
county--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--well--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--that
is...
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
it
is
the
state's
choice
whether
to
compel
the...
the
person
to...
to
testify,
and
if,
as
cook
county
has
done,
they
put
in
particular
efforts
to
protect
the
witness,
to
encourage
her
to
testify,
then
prosecutors
get
a
very
high
return.
that
is,
in...
in
the
cook
county
program,
80
percent
of...
of
the
witnesses
testify.
they
get
a
very
high
conviction
rate,
and
they
protect
the...
the
witnesses.
so
i
think
the
message
from
this
court
is
going
to
be
one
of
two
things.
either
it's
okay
to
adopt
a
california/oregon
type
of
statute
and
just...
just
let
any
statements
come...
come
in,
or
we
have
to
put
in
the
resources
to...
to...
into
domestic
violence
to
ensure
that
the
witnesses
come...
come
to
court.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
they--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--they...
they
would
not
be
compelled
to
do
that,
but...
they
would
not
be
compelled
constitutionally
to
do
that.
they
would
simply
be
deprived
of
a...
of...
of
the
so
called
evidence
based
prosecution,
which
has
just
been
a
phenomenon
of
the
last
14
years.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
that...
that--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--that...
that...
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
that
is
correct.
they...
they
would...
they
want
to
make
their
cases,
and...
and
i
think
they
can
make
their
cases
best
if
the
witness
testifies,
in
which
case,
under
the
confrontation
clause
now...
now
construed,
there's
no
objection
then
to
bringing
in
the
prior
statement
at
all.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
and...
and--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
well,
it
would
have
been
under
roberts
presumably.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
it's...
it's
an
exception.
in
civil
cases,
there's
no
problem.
in...
in
criminal
cases--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
yes,
but
until...
until
white
v.
illinois
basically
let
the
guard
down,
these...
these
statements
could
not
come...
accusatory
statements
that
might
have
been
in
present
sense
impressions
did
not...
were...
were
not
the
basis
for
prosecutions.
once...
once
white
v.
illinois
was
decided,
then...
then
courts
allowed
them
in
routinely.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i...
i
believe
that
is
correct
because
that--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--it...
it
shouldn't.
it's
an
accusatory...
it's
an
accusatory
statement
to...
to
a...
a...
to
law
enforcement.
now,
i
mean,
the
court
could,
if
it
wanted,
carve
out
or...
or
draw
the
line
at
statements
that
are
describing
the
contemporaneous...
the
absolutely
contemporaneous
commission
of
a
crime.
i
don't
think
it's
a
particularly
good
line
to
draw.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
the...
the
rule
is
that
the
hearsay
law...
the
rule
against
hearsay
provides...
the
modern
rule
against
hearsay
provides
no...
no
restriction.
the
confrontation
clause
should.
and
let
me
address
the...
your
concern,
justice
breyer,
that
is
this
hearsay
rather
than...
than
confrontation.
i
think...
i
think
that
the
notion
of
the
accuser
is
central
to
the
confrontation
right
and
always...
and
always
has
been,
and
those
2,000
cases
really
develop.
as
of
1791,
the
rule
against
hearsay
was
barely
developed,
and
we
cite...
or
the...
the
rule
against
hearsay
was
barely
developed
and
edmund
burke
said
that
a
trained
parrot
could
recite
all
the
laws
of
evidence
in
5
minutes,
and
that
is
no
longer...
that
is
no
longer
so.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
edmund
burke
said
that,
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
well,
i...
i
hope
not,
your
honor,
and
i...
i
believe
that
we've
gotten
past
the
point.
i
mean,
i
think
we
now
recognize
how
serious
a...
a
crime
domestic
violence
is.
let
me
emphasize
that
it
is
just
as
narrow...
sometimes
the
prosecutor
will
compel
a
victim
to
testify.
it
will
still
be
that...
sometimes
they
will
and
sometimes
they
won't.
that
will
be
a
matter
of...
of
state
policy.
there
are
other
approaches
as...
as
well.
and...
and
hopefully,
compulsion
isn't
necessary,
i
think,
if
the
prosecutors
pay...
pay
sufficient
attention
and...
and
care,
but
beyond
that,
there's
the
possibility
of
forfeiture.
if,
indeed,
the
reason
why
the
victim
will
not
testify
is
because
of
intimidation,
then...
then
the
prosecution...
it
is
open
to
the
prosecution
to
prove
that.
in
many
cases,
the
case
can
be
proven--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
and...
and,
of
course,
it
remains
to
be
seen
just
how
easy
or
how
hard
it...
it
is
to...
to
prove.
but,
in
fact,
the...
as
mr.
fisher
said,
the
rules
of
evidence
don't
apply
at
the...
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
it's
the
judge,
not
the...
the
jury
that
has
to
decide.
and
the
standard
of
proof
presumably
would
not
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--well,
intimidation
is...
is
a
crime,
but
it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
be
a
full
criminal
case.
it
would
be,
as
in
many
other
contexts,
simply
a
preliminary
hearing
on...
on
the
threshold
issue.
as
we
have
for
every
evidentiary
problem,
for
every...
for
any...
any
evidentiary
problem,
such
as
does
the
present
sense
impression
exception
apply,
there's
a
preliminary
issue.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--well,
it...
it
would
remain
for
the
court
to
determine
what
the
standards
are
for
proving--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i...
i--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--prior
decisions
of
the
court
suggest
that
that
would
most
likely
be
the...
the
standard.
it
may
be--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--oh,
i
think
that...
that
the
judge
may
well,
and
i
think
it
would
remain--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i
think
it
remains
an
open
question
what
the
standards
would
be
for...
for
proof
and
whether
that
would
be
constitutionally
accepted.
this,
of
course,
is
a
matter
for...
for
another
day.
i
think
what
the
court
can't
do
is
effectively
assume
as
a...
or
create
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
in
all
domestic
violence
cases,
the...
the
victim
has
been
intimidated,
which
is
what
the
state
asks,
even
though
they
acknowledge
at
the
very
outset
that
there
are
many
other
reasons
why...
why
the
victim
may
not
testify.
the...
there's
no
domestic
violence
exception
for
the
confrontation
right,
just
as
there's
no
organized
crime
exception
for
the
confrontation
right.
so
i
do
think
that...
that
what
the
procedures
are
for
forfeiture
is...
is
a
big
open
question.
but...
but
it's
the
state's
burden
to
prove
forfeiture.
it...
it
can't
be
assumed
as
a
per
se
matter.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
well,
our...
our
narrow
rule
is...
is
simply
the...
an
accusation
to
a
law
enforcement
officer.
we...
we,
of
course,
believe
that
the
more
general
test
is
reasonable
expectation
of
the
declarant
and
that's
where...
where
i
disagree
with...
with
professor
amar.
i
don't
know
that
he
would...
i
don't
know
that
he
would
disagree.
i'd
be
surprised
if
he
would
disagree
that
an
accusation
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
is...
is
testimonial
because...
because
that
is
such
a...
a
narrow
principle.
now...
now,
he
does
speak
about...
about
formality,
but
formality,
for
reasons
i
suggested,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
makes
an
awful
lot
of
sense
because
it
then
gives
the
police
officers
and
prosecutors
an
incentive
to
take
testimony
informally.
and
what
we
have
then,
as
in
this
case,
we
have
not
the
affidavit,
which...
which
the
state
is
condemning
as
admissible.
they
now
concede
that
that's
inadmissible.
the
evidence
on
which
this
prosecution
is
based
is
a
police
officer's
rendition
of
what
he
was
told
orally,
which
is
a
denigrated
form
of...
form
of
evidence.
that's
where
a
formality
rule
will...
will
get
you.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
and...
and--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--if...
if
the...
if
the
speaker
knows
that
the
law
enforcement
officer
is
there--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--then...
then
i...
then...
then
it's
not
within
the
narrow
categorical
rule
for
which
we're...
we're
asking
now.
it
may
come
within
the
general
test
of
reasonable
expectation.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
no,
not...
not
within
the...
within
the
narrow
categorical
rule
that
we're
asking.
i
think
it's
another
question
if,
say,
you're
speaking
to
a...
a
doctor
who's
an
employee
of
the
state
hospital--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--a
911
operator
is
a
direct
conduit
to
the
police,
and
the
police
are
a
direct
conduit
to
the
court.
and...
and
that
addresses
your
hypothetical,
justice
scalia,
about
the...
the
affidavit
right
to
the
court.
the
person
writes
an
affidavit
right
to
the
court.
under...
under
the
theory
presented
by
the
state
under
the
resemblance
theory...
let's
take
away
the...
the
sworn
part
of
the
affidavit.
it's
just
a
letter
or...
or
a
message
over
the
internet
or
a
videotape.
all
of
those
would
be
allowed
because
there's
no
formality,
because
there's
no
interrogation,
and
that's
a
grotesque
result--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--well,
i'm...
i'm
not
saying
there
necessarily
should
be
a
difference.
i
think...
i
think
in
the--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--we're
saying
that
is
an
easy
case.
that's
what
professor
mosteller
calls
a
dead
bang
case
where
it's
made
to
a
police
officer.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i
think
it's
an
easier
case
because
the
police
officer
is
a
direct
conduit
to
the...
to
the
machinery
of...
of
justice.
when
you're
speaking
to
a
police
officer,
you
know
you're
speaking
to
the
state.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i...
i
think
that
whenever
there
is
a...
an
out
of
court
accusation
repeated,
there
is
a
witness
in
court,
but
that
is
not
the
witness
that...
or
that
doesn't
satisfy
the
confrontation
right
because
as
the...
the--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--yes,
absolutely,
the
officer
was--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--that's...
that,
of
course,
is
the...
that...
that's
the
question.
but...
but
she
was
acting
as
a...
a
witness
when...
when
she
made
the
accusation
to...
to
the
officer,
and
characterizing
it
as
an
emergency
i
don't
think
helps
anything
in...
in
this
case.
the...
the
fact
is
that
if
we
extend
the
emergency
this
far
shows...
well,
it
shows
just
how
capable
of
expansion
the...
the
theory
is
because
there
is
an
officer
with
her
and
there
is
an
officer
with...
with
him.
so
the...
the
only
question
is
should
the
officers
leave.
that
means
that
whenever
there's...
there's
a
victim
potentially
at
large
there,
the
confrontation
right
wouldn't...
wouldn't
apply.
the...
the
whole
emergency
doctrine
really
distorts
incentives
because
a...
a
police
officer
who
has
a...
a
dual
motive
of
creating...
of
protecting
people,
protecting
the
safety
of...
of
people
and
gathering
evidence...
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
do...
under
an
emergency
doctrine,
would
have
an
incentive
to
preserve
the
emergency
or
the
appearance
of
emergency
for...
for
as
long
as...
for
as
long
as
possible.
and
i...
i
think
the...
the
state
encourages
people
to
call,
which
of
course
they
should
do,
but
in
part
the
reason
why
people
are
encouraged
to
call
is
to...
is
to
create...
is
to
pass
on...
is
to
pass
on
evidence.
so
i
don't
think
that
even
if...
even
to
the
extent
that
the
call
is
a...
a
cry
for
help,
well,
the
help
is...
is
seeking
invitation
of
the...
of
the
legal
system.
in
the
davis
case,
of
course,
it
was
an
arrest.
in...
in
this
case,
the...
the
statement
was
not
a
cry
for
help.
it
was
in
response
to
the
second
inquiry
by
the
police
officer.
the
police
officer
was...
was
pressing.
and...
and
i...
i
think
the...
the
emergency
doctrine
simply...
simply
can't...
if...
if
there
were
an
emergency
doctrine,
i
think
it's
just
badly
founded
and
couldn't
apply
here.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
believe
crawford
has
brought
us
to
a
remarkable
crossroads.
if
the
accusation
in
this
case
is
allowed
to
secure
a
conviction
without
the
state
providing
an
opportunity
for
confrontation,
then
the
confrontation
clause
will
be
little
more
than
a
charade,
easily
abated
by
state
officers
gathering
evidence.
but
if
the
court
proclaims
that
a
conviction
cannot
be
based
on
an
accusation
made
privately
to
a
known
police
officer,
then
it
will
take
a
long
step
to
ensure
that
the
confrontation
right
remains
robust,
as
the
framers
intended
for
centuries
to
come.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
well--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i...
i...
not
much,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i...
i
don't
think
an
accusation
to
a
known
law
enforcement
officer
is
awfully
vague.
any
legal
term
will
have
some...
some
vagueness
around
the
edges,
but
i
don't
think
there's
much.
resemblance
is
awfully
vague.
i
think
what
happened
here
resembled
the
inquisitorial
practices
in
the
key...
in
the
key...
in
a
key
respect.
and
i
don't
think
the
test
your
honor
is
proposing
handles
the
message
over
the
internet
or...
or
a
letter,
the...
the
tape
made
at
the
initiative
of
the...
of
the
witness.
i
think
it...
it
utterly
fails
to
get
that
because
the...
the
prosecutors
aren't
involved.
but
clearly
the
confrontation
clause
was
written
against
the
backdrop
of
private
prosecution,
the
system
of
private
prosecution.
so
it
has
to
fit
those.
i...
i
think
that
this
case
can
be
resolved
on
those
very
narrow
grounds
without
trying
to
establish
the
broad,
general
meaning
of
the
confrontation
clause.
i'm...
i'm
hoping
that
the
court
is
building
a
framework
for
hundreds
of
years
to...
to
come,
and
i
think
it's
more
important
that
it
be
built
right
and
that
it
be
built
quickly.
and
so
i
think
an
important
first
step
is
to
say
an
accusation
to
a
known
police
officer,
whatever
else
is
testimonial,
that
clearly
must
be.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'm
pleased
to
submit
the
case.
