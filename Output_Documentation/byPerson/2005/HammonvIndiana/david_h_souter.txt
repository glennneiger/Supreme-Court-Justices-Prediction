isn't...
isn't
the
problem,
though...
i
mean,
as
crawford
said,
those
examples
defined
the
core.
they
were
the
paradigms,
but
they
didn't
purport
to
cover
the
whole
ground.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
is
to
turn
the
core
into
the
exclusive
examples,
in
which
case
the
confrontation
clause
in
the
real
world
is
never
going
to
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
your
criterion,
are
you
going
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
letter
and
the
tape
recording?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
answer
it.
is...
is
the
tape
recording
like
the
letter
so
that
it...
it's
inadmissible?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
answer,
i
take
it,
assumes
that
the
framers
had
no
concern
with
the
capacity
of
the
court
to
test
the...
the
validity
or
the
truth
of
the
statement.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but...
no.
but
i'm...
i'm
not
talking
about
outrageous
circumstances
in
which
the...
the
statement
was
taken.
i'm
talking
about
the
capacity
of
the
court,
by
whatever
means,
to
test
the
truth
of
that
statement
once
it
is
placed
before
the
court.
and
i
understood
your
argument
to
justice
breyer
to
assume
that
that
testing
function
was
not
within
the
contemplation
of
the
framers.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
your...
your...
you
would
then
say
they
want
a...
they
want
to
test
certain...
in
certain
cases
where
they
think
there
may
have
been
an
abuse
in
the
elicitation
of
the
statement,
but
if
there
is...
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
that
the
statement
was
taken
under
untoward
circumstances,
they
were
not
concerned
to
test
its
validity.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
don't...
don't
you
think
the
framers
were
aware
of
the
fact
that
although
there
were
law
enforcement
abuses,
raleigh's
case
and
so
on,
there
were
also
abuses
every
day
of
the
week
on
the
part
of
people
who
gave
false
testimony
because
they
had
grudges
against
the
defendant?
do
you
think
that
was
totally
out
of
the
minds
of
the
framers
so
as
to
support
the
distinction
that...
that
as
a
general
rule
you
were
suggesting?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
would...
why
would
we
impute
that...
that
unconcern
to
the
framers
about
the...
the
need
to
test
statements
which
may
very
well
have...
have
been
given
because
of
envy,
grudge,
and
so
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
doesn't...
doesn't
that
get
us
back
to
the
fact
that
those
examples
were
given
in
crawford
as
paradigm
examples,
if,
you
know,
those
were...
i
think
the
word
poor
was
used.
but...
but
crawford
was
not
limited
to
that,
and
if
it's
not
limited
to
that,
why,
in
effect,
does
the...
does
the...
should
we
conclude
that
the
concern
of
the
clause
stops
short
of
the
self
interested
witness
even
though
he
didn't
make
an
affidavit?
