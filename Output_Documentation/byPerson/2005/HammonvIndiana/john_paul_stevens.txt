justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
fisher?
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
an
entirely
volunteered
affidavit
by
the
accuser?
is
that
admissible
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
would
be
prohibited
by
the
confrontation
clause.
yet,
that
was
clearly
not
an
example
that
would
fall
within
the
marian
practice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
it
doesn't
resemble
it
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fisher,
let
me
again
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
would
the
unsworn
letter
that
justice
scalia
describes
be
admissible
or
inadmissible
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
you
don't
rely
on
the
affidavit
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
the
problem
with
the
examples
is
that
none
of
these
are
abuses.
as
i
see
it,
the
examples
of
the
tape
recording
mailed
in
and
the
volunteer
statement,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
call
those
abuses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
under
your
view,
was
the
affidavit
admissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
suggest
the
reason
it
was
not
admissible
is
it's
very
clear
that
the
affidavit
is
the
testimonial
statement
by
a
witness
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
confront.
the
constitutional
right
is
the
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
if
the
officer
independently
repeats
what
is
said
in
the
affidavit,
then
he's
the
witness
against
rather
than
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
gornstein?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gornstein,
is
this
a
fair
summary
of
your
position,
if
i
may?
we're
really
asking
who's
the
witness
that's
being
testified
against,
and
when
it's
the
affidavit,
it's
clearly
the
woman
that's
a
witness
there
where
it's
inadmissible.
but
your
view,
as
i
understand
you,
is
when
it's
the
officer
who
is
the
witness,
he's
subject
to
cross
examination,
and
as
long
as
the
emergency
continues
and
he's
describing
what
happened
during
the
emergency,
he's
still
the
witness.
that's
what
you're
saying,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
still
the
witness
we're
concerned
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore,
he's
subject
to
cross
examination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
during
the
emergency
period,
he
can
repeat
what
she
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
we
focus
not
on
whether
it's
testimony
but
whether
he's
the
witness
at
the
critical
time
or
whether
she's
the
witness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
your
test,
the
whole
question
is
whether
the
emergency
continued
at
the
time
the
witness'
words
are
being
repeated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
not
arguing
that.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out...
i
think
i
have
a
little
different
angle
on
it
than
you
actually
said
in
your
brief
or
actually
in
the
text
of
crawford.
of
course,
crawford
wasn't
confronting
this
problem.
it
described
everything
as
testimonial,
but
the
real
question
is
who's
the
witness
under
the
text
of
the
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
think
your
argument
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
think
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
[laughter]
i
know
it
didn't
start
out
that
way,
but
it
seems
to
me
i'm
helping
your
side
of
it.
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
would
agree
that
the
officer
could
testify
to
some
of
the
things
that
happened
during
the
emergency,
and
he's
a
witness
to
that
extent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
is
whether
he
can
cover
this
as
well.
