chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
hammon
v.
indiana.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
are
back...
as
justice
breyer
pointed
earlier,
you're
making
the
prosecution
prove
two
crimes
instead
of
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
every
evidentiary
problem,
the...
the
root
of
the
problem
is
not
the
inability
of
the...
or
the
unwillingness
of
the
primary
victim
to
testify.
i
mean,
that's
what
makes
intimidation
so
hard
to
prove
in
these
cases
is
because
you
have
to
get
the...
if...
if
the
intimidation
is
successful,
the
witness
to
testify
about
the...
the
crime
is
unavailable
and
unwilling
to
do
so.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the...
the
judge
can't
make
that
finding
if
the
witness
doesn't
testify,
can
he?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how's
that?
the
prosecutor
goes
in
and
says,
we
think
the
defendant
has
intimidated
the
witness
by
saying
he's
not
going
to
support
her
financially,
he's
going
to
leave,
whatever,
and...
and
the...
presumably
the...
the
defendant
says
no...
no,
and
the
witness
isn't
there.
the
judge
says,
well,
i
find
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
has
intimidated
her?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where...
where
do
you
come
out
on
the
person
running
out
of
the
house
and
yelling
to
her
neighbor
with
the
law
enforcement
officer
standing
by?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not...
the
statement
is
not
to
the
law
enforcement
officer,
but
he
or
she
overhears
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
anybody...
is
anybody
working
for
the
state
a
law
enforcement
officer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
videotape...
a
videotape
of
a
crime
scene
is
admissible.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
a
tape
recording
by
the
same
person
who
videotaped
the
crime
scene,
describing
what
he
saw,
you
agree
would
be
excluded.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
a...
it's
a
classic
mixed
motive
case.
we
don't
know
when
the
officer
is
sitting
down
with
her
and
asking
the
questions,
whether
his
primary
motive
is
to
make
sure
the
guy
doesn't
come
back
or
if
his
primary
motive
is
to
help
make
the
case
against
the
guy.
it's
both.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gornstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
use
the
word
testimony,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
maybe
that...
and
maybe
you're
not
a
witness
when
you
make
the
call,
but
when
that
same
call
is
admitted
into
court,
then...
then
it
strikes
me
that
you
are
a
witness.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
the
way
the
court
looked
at
it
in
crawford.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
friedman,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
announcement
in
05-5224
davis
v.
washington,
and
05-5705,
hammon
v.
indiana.
