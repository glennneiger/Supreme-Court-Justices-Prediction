mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
previous
questioning
suggests,
the
outcome
of
this
case
follows
directly
from
steiner.
the
portal
act,
by
its
terms,
applies
only
to
activities
that
occur
before
the
commencement
of...
before
the
commencement
of,
or
after
the
conclusion
of,
the
employees'
principal
activities.
steiner
holds
that
donning
and
doffing,
such
as
in
this
case,
is
"part
of"...
that's
a
quote...
the
employees'
principal
activities,
and
it,
therefore,
follows
that
the
portal
act
applies
only
to
activities
either
prior
to,
or
after,
that
donning
and
doffing.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because...
and
this
is
the
language
that
mr.
phillips
is
referring
to
in
steiner...
4(a)(1)
itself
makes
clear
that
a
walk
will
not
be
the
first
principal
activity,
including
on
the
theory
that
it's
integral
and
indispensable.
the
first
principal
activity
has
to
be
something
other
than
a
walk,
and
that's
what
happens
in
this
case.
as
in
steiner,
there
is
donning
at
the
beginning
of
the
day.
that's
part
of
the
principal
activities--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--two
reasons,
justice
scalia.
the
first
is
the
one
that
i
gave,
and
that
is,
the
steiner
court
concluded
that...
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
sentence,
where
it
said,
4(a)(1)>
["],
that
congress
made
clear
in
4(a)(1)...
that
the
initial
walk
wouldn't
be
the
first
principal
activity.
second,
the
walk
won't
be
integral
and
indispensable.
the
test
for
whether
or
not
something
is
integral
and
indispensable
is
whether
it's
work
that's
required
and
closely
related
to
the
productive
activities.
and
simply
walking
to
the
donning
station
is
not.
that's
in
contradistinction
to
putting
on
the
clothes
that
are
required
here,
required
as
a
matter
of
law
in
order
to
do
your
job.
that's
the
line
that
the
statute
draws.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
dog
cases,
justice
kennedy...
and
i...
let
me
make
sure
we're...
i
have
your
hypothetical,
and
that
is,
the
police
officer
at
home
grooms
the
dog.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
then
it
comes
into
the
office.
that
is
part
of
their
principal
activities.
the
subsequent
commute
is
not
compensable,
on
the
ground
that
it
is
a
break
and
a
commute.
that's
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
portal
act
is
concerned
with
something
else...
that
is,
before
the
beginning
and
after
the
end
of
your
day.
the
dog
cases
are,
of
course,
also
entirely
different
from
this
one.
you
have...
you
have
arrived
at
the
place
of
the
performance
of
your
principal
activity.
steiner
said
that
occurred,
quote/unquote,
"on
or
off
the
production
floor.
"
and
so,
you're
at
the
plant,
and
your
workday
has
started.
justice
scalia,
you
made
the
point,
and
i
simply
want
to
reinforce
it,
that
the
reference
in...
to
4(a)(2)
is
the
same
as
the
reference
to
4(a)(1),
but
it's
also
the
reference
to
principal
activities
in
the
concluding
clause
of
section
4.
if
i
could
just
take
the
court
to
that.
the
statute
is
obviously
reproduced
in
a
variety
of
places,
but
it's
also
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
and
so,
after
4(a)(1)
and
4(a)(2),
there's
this
concluding
clause,
and
the
text
frames
the
workday.
and
it
says
that
the
portal
act,
4(a)(1)
and
(2),
will
apply
to
activities
which
occur...
i'm
quoting
now...
"which
occur
either
prior
to
the
time
on
any
particular
workday
at
which
such
employee
commences,
or
subsequent
to
the
time
on
any
particular
workday
at
which
he
ceases,
such
principal
activity
or
activities.
"
and
it
simply
follows,
as
a
matter
of
the
plain
text,
that
when
steiner
held
that
those
activities,
"such
principal
activities",
include
the
donning
and
the
doffing,
that
everything
that
happens
between
those
two
events
is
not
encompassed
by
the
portal
act.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
the...
both
the
donning
and
the
doffing
and
the
walking
in
between
and
the
wait
for
the
equipment,
which
is
the
bulk
of
the
time
in
all
these
cases,
would
be
compensable.
the
department
of
labor
has
regulations--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
there...
the
donning
and
doffing
in
the
alvarez
case,
by
and
large,
happens
in
one
place:
in
a
locker
room.
in
the
tum
case,
by
contrast,
the
employees
show
up
at
a
cage,
they
wait
for
things,
they
walk,
they
pick
up
something
else,
they
wait,
they
pick
up
something
else.
and
so,
there's
a
body
of
time
that
i
refer
to
as
the
donning
and
doffing
process.
all
of
that
would
clearly
be
compensable,
even
in
your
hypothetical.
your
hypothetical
would
address
the
final
piece
of
time,
and
that
is,
you
get
your
last
piece
of
clothing
on,
and
you
have
to
go
to
the
floor,
and
the
employer
could
say,
15
minute
break>
["],
in
there.
i
suppose
that's
hypothetically
possible.
i
think
the
reason
it
doesn't
happen
in
these
cases
and
in
the
other
cases
i've
studied
is
that
the
employer
has
an
incentive,
when
they're
forced
to
compensate,
to
do
things
efficiently.
what
happens
is,
the
employer
will
say,
"all
right,
your
shift
is
going
to
start
at
6:30
in
the
morning;
therefore,
you
can
clock
in
and
start
donning
at
6:23.
"
that's
a
seven
minute
window,
and
that
forces
the
employees
to
do
everything
efficiently.
they
don't
insert
artificial
breaks.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
justice
scalia,
i...
all
i
have
in...
before
me
that
i
can
rely
on
is
the
statute
that
congress
enacted.
your
point
would
cover,
of
course,
equally,
the
donning
and
doffing
in
steiner
itself.
congress
made
some
choices
about
things
that
were
going
to
be
compensable.
it's
worth
noting
that
congress
drew
a
line
about
whether...
in
terms
of
whether
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
involved,
because
under
section
203(o)
of
the
statute,
in
workplaces
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
you
can
negotiate
out
of
at
least
clothes
changing.
but
i
think
within
the
framework
of
the
statute
that
we
do
have,
i
am
actually
quite
correct,
and
that
is,
right
now,
today,
the
employers
have
no
incentive
to
adopt
an
efficient
scheme
for
arranging
donning
and
doffing.
they
can
put
things
in
different
buildings
if
they
like.
the
employees
here
are
required
to
spend
10
or
20
minutes
waiting
for
different
clothing
at
different
times,
depending
on
how
long
the
lines
are.
it
is
a
workable
scheme
that
congress
designed
that
said,
"we're
going
to
have
a
workday.
"
and
the
employer
is
in
charge
of
deciding
when
the
workday
begins
or
ends,
but,
during
that
workday,
they're
going
to
have
to
pay.
i
did
want
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
it
is
an
unsettled
question,
is
the
answer.
i
will
give
you
the
best
answer
i
can.
203(o)
allows
for
the
negotiation
away
of
clothes
changing
time.
the
question
whether
clothes
changing
time
includes
safety
equipment
is
a
matter
in
dispute.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
it
didn't.
this
court
denied
certiorari
on
that
question.
the
further
question,
if
you
did
negotiate
away
the
clothes
changing
time,
whether
that
would
negotiate
away
the
walking
and
waiting
time
has
not
been
confronted
by
a
court,
so
far
as
i
am
aware.
it
might
be
said
to
logically
follow,
but
it
hasn't
been
decided.
it's
not
presented
by
this
case,
because
cert
was
denied.
and
so,
i
haven't--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is.
i'm
confident
it's
an
open
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
could--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
line
that
has
been
drawn
by
the
department
of
labor,
is
where
i
will
start,
and
the
department
of
labor...
and
let
me
give
you
some
citations...
says
that
the
line
is
between
whether
the
employer
requires
you
to
do
the
donning
and
doffing
on
the
plant
or
not.
the
citations
for
that
are
section
785.24(c)
of
the
regulations,
790,
note
65.
and
then
it
contrasts
clothes
changing
that's
by
your
own
choice,
in
790.7(g).
i
think
that's
a
sensible
line,
but
it's
not
presented
by
this
case.
justice
breyer,
it
goes
to
your
characterization
of
the
final
sentence
of
footnote
49,
and
that
is:
sometimes.
the
reason
i
think
it's
sensible
to
draw
the
line
that
the
department
is
in
required
clothes
changing
is
that
the
employer
will
only
require
you
to
do
it
onsite
if
it
is
truly
integral
and
indispensable
to
your
job;
otherwise,
it'll
be
optional,
or
they'll
let
you
do
it
at--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--can
i,
again,
make
sure
i
have
the
hypothetical
in
terms...
we
are,
in
a
sense,
talking
about
the
first
wait.
you
show
up
at
the
first--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yeah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--you
are...
in
that
situation,
you're
waiting
for
the
very
first
piece
of
equipment.
in
the
tum
case,
you
fill
up
at
the
cage
at
the
beginning
of
the
day.
you
are
engaged
to
wait.
the
regulatory
citations
are
two:
790.6(b)
and
790.7(h).
there's
also
a
case
that's
confronted
this,
which
is
the
metzler
case,
127
f.
3d
959.
all
those
authorities
make
clear
that
if
the
employer
tells
you,
"show
up
to
do
something,
show
up
here
to
put
on
your
clothes.
"
and,
because
of
the
way
the
employer
has
designed
the
system,
you
have
to
wait,
through
no
fault
of
your
own--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it's
the...
it
would
be
the
same
result
whether
the
employer
puts
a
time
on
it
or
not.
the
employer
says...
i'll
give
you
an
example
we
could
agree
on,
when
it's
a
time--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
reg
doesn't--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
regulation
gives
this
example,
which
i
think
is
on
point,
and
that
is,
if
you
are
told
to
show
up
for
when
the
production
begins...
the
meat's
going
to
come
across...
and
the
machine
breaks
down
or
they
simply
don't
start
sending
the
meat
until
five
minutes
later,
the
fact
is
that
you
get
compensated,
because
you're
supposed
to
be
there.
the
fact
that
they
tell
you,
"be
there
for
the"--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
unquestionably.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
justice
breyer
is
testing
a
very
particular
piece
of
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
he's
trying
to
say,
what
is...
let
me
take
you
to
the
text
of
the
statute--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the...
he's
trying
to
figure
out
when
the...
the
final
clause
of
4(a)
talks
about
commencement...
he
want
to
know
when
it
commences.
does
it
commence
when
you
get
in
line
or
when
you--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--first
get
the
piece
of
clothes?
it's
a
fair
question.
the
other
side
hasn't
made
any
argument
that
it
doesn't
include
the
first
wait,
i
think,
because
you're
told
that
you
have
to
don,
it's
part
of
your
principal
activity.
let
me
also
say,
this,
i
think,
is
a
somewhat
academic
question
when
it
comes
to...
and
nothing
against
academics,
but
the...
it's
a
somewhat
academic
question
when
it
comes
to
actual
workplaces,
because
what
happens
is
what
i
described
before,
the
employers,
under
employers
that
are
following
our
rule,
do
set
up
a
time
clock,
and
they
say,
"show
up
at
6:23,
and
that's
when
you
can
clock
in.
"
they
have
computerized
swipe
cards,
and
the
computer
won't
recognize
them
until
6:23.
and
it's
the
time
after
that
that
will
be
compensable.
so,
if
the
court
were
to
say
the
donning
and
doffing
process
starts
and
ends
the
workday
for
purposes
of
the
portal
act,
everyone
will
understand
what
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
right.
the
reason
for
that
is,
there
isn't
a
pre
donning
wait
in
the
alvarez
case,
where
the
plaintiffs
won,
and
the
tum
plaintiffs
lost
on
an
unrelated
theory
that
the
actual
donning
and
doffing
couldn't
start
the
workday.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
my
formulation,
which
is
simply
the
donning
and
doffing
process,
would,
in
fact,
leave
the...
to
the
lower
courts
the
question
of
precisely
when
donning
begins
and
doffing
ends.
that's
a
fair--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
scalia,
my
answer,
i--
think,
is
that...
you
had
it
right
in
the
first
half
hour,
and
that
is,
that
phrase--
[laughter]
i.e.,
we're
denying
that
it
follows
a
fortiori,
or
we're
simply
not
deciding
the
question.
the
agency
itself,
which...
the
secretary
wrote
this
guidance...
the
agency
explains
that
it
meant
that
we're
simply
not
deciding
it.
that's
actually
perfectly
intelligible
and
a
correct
understanding
of
the
history.
remember,
the
portal
act
gets
enacted,
and,
right
afterwards,
the
secretary
issues
this
guidance
that
then
gets
put
in
the
cfr.
this
was
their
first
reaction
to
the
act.
subsequently,
after
several
years,
these
are...
what
you're
referring
to
is
something
in
the...
what
are
known
as
the
part
790
guidance.
later
on,
the
secretary
issued
what's
called
the
part
785
guidance.
and,
in
785.3,
it
said,
anything
that,
in
785,
contradicts
790,
controls.
and
785.38
is
the
relevant
citation.
and
there
they
say,
"if
you
show
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
day
and
you're
given
instructions,
or
you
show
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
day
and
you
get
a
set
of
tools,
what
follows
after
that,
in
terms
of
travel
time,
is
compensable.
"
can
i
answer
two...
make
two
other
very
quick
points?
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
about
mootness.
i
would
refer
you
to
the
deposit
guarantee
case,
445
u.s.
326,
which
talks
about
collateral
estoppel
effects.
there
is
ongoing
litigation
against
this
defendant
on
this
question,
a
case
called
chavez,
in
the
district
court.
the
citation
for
the
proposition
that
it
will
collaterally
estop
them
is
the
restatement
section
of
judgments,
section--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it's
true,
you
could
dig
the
case.
my
only
point
is
that
it
is
not
moot.
and
perhaps
the
variety
of
workplaces
shown
in
the
two
cases
would
illustrate
things
for
the
lower
courts.
i
suspect
that
may
have
been
why
the
court
granted
cert.--
i
also
wanted
to
respond
to
the
suggestion
that
this
is
a
surprise
to
industry,
with
just
a
couple
of
citations.
walking
and
waiting
time
has
been
held
compensable
since
at
least
1961.
the
mitchell
case,
286
f.
2d
721,
the
barrentine
case,
750
f.
2d
47.
there
was
a
meatpacking
plant
at
least
seven
years
ago,
127
f.
3d
959.
and
this
has
been
the
agency's
enforcement
position
at
least
since
the
late
1980s.
it's
sufficiently
settled
that
