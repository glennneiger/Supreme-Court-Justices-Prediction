i
would
have
thought
that,
but
we've
held
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we've
held
that
they're...
that
the
principal
activity
consists
of
doffing...
donning
and
doffing
the
clothes
required,
haven't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
felt
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
necessarily
excluded.
it's
really
noncommittal
on
the
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
can
i
call
your
attention
to
the
text
of
section
254(a)?
it's
in
the
red
brief
in
the
alvarez
case,
at
app.
1.
what
it...
what
it
says
is
that
you
don't
have
to
pay
overtime
compensation
or
minimum
wages
or
on
account
of
any
of
the
following
activities:
(1)
"walking,
riding",
blah,
blah,
blah.
this
is
(1).
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
the
"place
of
performance
of
the
principal
activity
or
activities
which
such
employee
is
employed
to
perform.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
(2)
"activities
which
are
preliminary
to
or
postliminary
to
said
principal
activity
or
activities.
"
you're
trying
to
sever
(1)
and
(2),
when
the
text
itself
joins
them.
the
activities
referred
to
in
(2)
are
"said
principal
activity
or
activities".
the
(1).
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
we
possibly
sever
(1)
and
(2)
and
say
that
for
purposes
of
one,
it
means
one
thing;
for
purposes
of
two,
it
means
something
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
for
all
activities
that
are...
that
are
integral
and
indispensable?
what
about
sharpening
tools?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
your
time
shouldn't
start
from
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that
advice
contained,
that
you
say
was
given
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
necessarily.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
they
operated
on
the
assumption
that
it
meant
never.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
they
were
on
notice
that,
although
it
did
not,
necessarily,
it
might.
i
think
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
exaggerating
the
effect
of
that
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
thing
specifically
included
in
(a)(1)
is
walking,
riding,
or
traveling
to
and
from
the
actual
place
of
performance
of
the
principal
activity
or
activities.
and
once
you
assume
that
(a)(1)
doesn't
cover
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
isn't
walking
from
the
gate
of
the...
of
the
factory
to
the...
to
the
place
where
you're
on
the
assembly
line,
why
isn't
that
integral
and
essential
to
the
performing
of
the
activities?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
but
if...
once
you
accept
the
theory
that
the
principal
activity
includes
those
things
that
are
integral,
you
can
say
walking
from
the
gate
of
the
plant
to
the
assembly
line
is
part
of
the
principal
activity.
now,
walking
to
the
gate
may
not
be
part
of
the...
may
not
be
part
of
the
principal
activity,
but...
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if...
what
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah,
but
why...
if
you're
talking
about
efficiency,
it
may
well
be
that
the
employees,
instead
of
imposing
upon
the
employer
the
costs
of
moving
the
donning
and
doffing
location
closer
to
the...
to
the
place
where
the
real
work
is
being
done,
they
might
prefer,
instead,
to
get
a
slight
salary
increase
per
hour.
but...
and
that
is...
that
is
possible,
under
the
petitioner's
scheme,
because
it
is
left
to
private
negotiation;
whereas,
what
you
say
is
that
they
must
pay
for
that.
they
must
pay
for
that
walk
from
the
donning
and
doffing.
they
cannot
negotiate
out
of
it,
because
if
it's
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
it
is
mandatory.
so
i...
don't
talk
to
us
about
efficiency.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
efficiency
arguments
are
on
the
other
side.
leave
it
to
the
private
sector.
the
employers...
the
employees
can
decide
what
they
care
more
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
would
say
that
the
whole
principle
of,
you
know,
"are
you
engaged
to
wait,
or
waiting
to
be
engaged?
"
just
contradicts
the
principle
that
was
adopted
in
steiner.
i
mean,
are
you
putting...
are
you
employed
to
put
on
your...
to
put
on
your
clothes,
or
are
you
putting
on
your
clothes
to
do
your
work?
and
steiner
essentially
repudiates
that.
so,
you
know,
let's
forget
about
skidmore.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goldstein,
since
you
display
such
respect
for
the
agency
here--
[laughter]
--what
do
you
do
about
the
agency's
footnote
that
flatly
contradicts
your
theory
of
the
case,
and
which
says
that
the
mere
fact
that
donning
and
doffing
may
require
compensation
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
travel
between
the
clothes
changing
place
and
the
actual
place
of
performance
would
be
excluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
think
that
opinion
was
just
flatly
wrong,
that
congress,
when
it
referred
to
the
"principal
activity
or
activities",
was
talking
about
the
cutting
of
the
meat
or
whatever
the
employer
hired
the
person
to
do?
he
didn't
hire
him
to
put
on
clothes.
what
if
i
think
that?
why
do
i
have
to
extend
what
i
think
to
be
an
erroneous
decision
beyond
its
narrow
holding?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
i
say
that
steiner
requires
that
interpretation
of
what
constitutes
a
"principal
activity"
only
for
purposes
of
determining
what
is
compensable,
and
that
when
we...
when
we
come
to
examine
the
separate
question,
of
when
the
workday
begins,
we
can...
we
can
apply,
as
far
as
precedent
is
concerned,
a
different
interpretation
of
what
is
a
"principal
activity"?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
say--
