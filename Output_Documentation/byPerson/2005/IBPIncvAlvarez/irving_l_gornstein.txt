mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
portal
act
excludes
walking
time
from
compensation
only
when
it
occurs
outside
the
workday,
before
an
employee
commences,
or
after
he
ceases,
his
principal
activities.
and
steiner
held
that
the
term
"principal
activities"
includes
activities
that
are
an
integral
and
indispensable
part
of
the
principal
activities.
it
follows
that
when
donning
and
doffing
are
integral
and
indispensable
parts
of
the
principal
activities
of
the
employees,
then
walking
that
occurs
after
donning,
and
before
doffing,
occurs
within
the
workday,
and
it
is
not
excluded
from
compensation
by
the
portal
act.
now,
the
employers
in
these
cases
have
argued
that
the
term
"principal
activities"
does
not
encompass
activities
that
are
integral
and
indispensable
parts
thereof,
and
that
steiner
did
not
so
hold.
but,
at
the
very
outset
of
its
opinion,
the
court,
in
steiner,
posed
the
question
presented
as
whether
changing
clothes
and
showering
are
compensable
as
part
of
the
employee's
principal
activities,
and
had
answered
that
question
several
pages
later
by
stating
that
it
agreed
with
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
that
the
term
"principal
activities"
includes
activities
that
are
an
integral
and
indispensable
part
of
the
principal
activities,
and
that
the
activities
in
question
in
that
case
fit
within
that
description.
now,
that
was
the
only
textual
basis
on
which
the
court
could
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
it
did,
because,
if
the
only
principal
activities
in
that
case
had
occurred
on
the
production
floor,
then
the
changing
of
clothes
at
the
beginning
of
the
day,
and
the
showering
at
the
end
of
the
day,
necessarily
would
have
been
preliminary
to
and
postliminary
to
said
principal
activities,
and
thereby
expressly
excluded
from
compensation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
scalia,
we
are
not
asking
for
an
extension
of
what
you
would
regard
as
an
erroneous
holding.
all
we're
saying
is
that
you
read
the
term
"principal
activities"
as
the
court
interpreted
it
in
steiner.
once
you
do
that,
and
you
plug
it
into
the
statute,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
takes
over,
because
it
says
that
walking
is
only
excluded
when
it
comes
before
the
employee
commences,
or
after
he
ceases,
the
principal
activities.
once
you
plug
"integral
and
indispensable"
into
that
sentence,
as
steiner
requires,
then
you
are...
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
tells
you
that
that
time
is
not...
is
compensable
when
it
occurs
after
donning
and
before
doffing.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
because
the
term
(a)(1).
that's
the
first
place
it
appears.
everywhere
else
it
appears,
including
in
(a)(2)
and
in
the
concluding
sentence,
it
says
"said
principal
activities".
so,
the
statute
itself
tells
you
that
the
term
"principal
activities"
has
to
mean
the
same
thing
everywhere
it
appears.
and
since
you
have
already
interpreted
that
term,
in
steiner,
to
include
"integral
and
indispensable
activities",
that
terminology
has
to
appear
everywhere
in
the
statute.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
first
of
all,
that
question
arises
not
under
the
portal
act,
which
only
applies
before
the
principal
activities
begin
and
after
they
end,
but
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
itself.
and
that
question
would
be
governed
by
the
court's
prior
decisions
on
what
constitutes
hours
worked,
together
with
the
department
of
labor's
regulations
that
address
what
constitute
hours
worked.
and...
within
the
workday...
and
what
the
department
of
labor
has
said
is,
generally,
everything
within
the
workday
is
compensable,
except
for
a
meal
period
and
except
for
a
time
period
where
there
is
a
break
that
is
so
substantial
that
the
employees
can
effectively
use
that
time
for
their
own
purposes.
and
so,
it
says
things
like
5
to
20-minute
breaks
are
not
periods
where
the
employee
is
not
working,
but
they
are
resting
for
the
further
work.
that
is
common
in
the
industry.
and
so,
that
would
be
an
issue
that
would
arise
when
you
had
a
break
that
was
much
longer
than
that,
probably
at
least
a
half
hour,
where
you
can
actually
effectively
use
that
time
for
your
own
purposes
and
are
not
required,
essentially,
to
stay
around
on
the
employer's
premises
and
to
wait
or
rest
to
begin
your
work
anew.
so--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
you...
that
you
have
to
have
a...
work
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
then
you
have
to
have
the
exclusion
from
that
not
apply.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
issue
here,
the
exclusion
doesn't
apply,
and
nobody
has
raised
the
question
about
whether
this
is
hours
worked
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
but
clearly
it
is,
under
the
court's
decisions.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
on
the...
on
the
waiting
before
the
clothes,
there's...
there
are
two
series
of
waits:
the
first
wait
and
then
later
waits.
as
to
the
later
waits,
once
you
decide
that
the
donning
begins
the
process
of
principal
activities--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
initial
wait.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
initial
wait--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--we
do
think
that's
covered.
and
under...
the
department
of
labor's
approach
is
to
treat
a
required
wait
for
an
activity
as
an
integral
part
of
that
activity.
so,
if
that
activity
is,
itself,
compensable
as
a
principal
activity,
then
the
required
wait
for
that
would
also
be--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--compensable
as
part
of
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
what
the...
the
department
distinguishes--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
if
the
employee
is
simply
voluntarily
arriving
earlier
than--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--he
has
to
and
wait--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--when--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it's
a
required
wait
anytime,
in
order
to
get
to
the
production
floor
on
time,
the
employee
has
to
be
at
the
donning
station
in
a
sufficient
period
of
time
to
get
there,
and
if
there's
a
wait
at
that
time,
then
he's
being
required
to
wait.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i'm
not
sure
i
view
that
the...
the
question
as
not
having
been
decided
below.
and
the
court
also
did
grant
certiorari
on
waiting
time.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
they
said
"unreasonable
period
of
time
for
waiting.
"
is
non
compensable.
and
that,
at
least
as
a
general
rule,
is
not--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i'm...
my
memory,
at
least,
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
is
that
it
was
saying
that
the
wait
before
the
donning
was
not
compensable,
because
it
was
a
preliminary
activity.
but
i...
if
you've
read
it
differently,
then
that
may
be--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
court
always
has
discretion
not
to
decide--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
question.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i...
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
breyer,
if
you
do
not
want
to
decide
that
question,
you
don't
have
to
decide
it.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
court
granted--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--certiorari
as
an
issue
that
can
be,
and
should
be,
resolved,
in
our
view.
but
if
the
court
doesn't
want
to
resolve
that
issue,
that's
fine.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
forty
nine.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
should
have.
because
even
at
the
time
it
was
written,
that
reservation
was
in
tension
or
not
in
conflict
with
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations.
and
certainly
by
the
time
of
steiner,
it
was
clear
that
this
kind
of
time
was
compensable.
