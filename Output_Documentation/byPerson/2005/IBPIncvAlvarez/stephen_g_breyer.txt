well,
it
is
if
we
don't
accept
the
continuous
workday
rule.
if
we
do
accept
the
continuous
workday
rule,
why
isn't
it,
in
effect,
the
premise
from
which
the
conclusion
for
the
other
side
falls?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
do
you
think
about
the
possibility,
"it
depends
on
the
clothes
and
depends
on
the
equipment.
"
so
that,
in
steiner
and
here,
it's
a
lot
of
protective
gear,
it's
really
quite
part
of
the
job
and
special
and
unusual.
in
mt.
clemens,
it's
a
kind
of
uniform.
it's
just
washing
your
hands,
putting
on
an
apron.
so,
where
it's
minor
putting
on
clothes,
as
someone
might
in
his
house,
doesn't
come
in
substantial,
doesn't
come
in
integral
and
indispensable;
but
where
it's
quite
a
big
deal,
it
does.
and
who
decides?
the
agency.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
"in
certain"--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
footnote...
that's
where
i
actually
got
the
idea...
it
says,
"we
reserve,
in
certain
situations.
"
to
me,
that
meant
sometimes
it
can
be
a
major
big
deal
to
don
clothing...
protective
gear;
sometimes
it
isn't...
an
apron.
and
whose
job
is
it?
now
i'm
repeating
myself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
secretary's.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
about
a...
the
other
part
of
the
case?
i
mean,
i
think,
as
i've
suggested,
most
of
these
things
are
up
to
the
agency.
they're
minor
things
in
the
law,
so...
but
it
seems
well
established
in
the
agency
reg,
as
well
as
in
skidmore,
the
famous
line
about
waiting
being,
"are
you
waiting
to
be
engaged,
or
are
you
engaged
to
wait?
"
so,
assuming
that
this
is
just
putting
on
and
off
clothes
that
are
essential...
so,
assume
you
win
on
that
part...
when
they
wait
to
put
on
the
clothes,
you
would
think...
if
it's
like
an
airport,
sometimes
you
wait;
if
you're
lucky,
you
don't.
well,
under
those
circumstances,
you
wouldn't
be
engaged
to
wait.
you're
waiting
to
put
on
the
clothes,
not...
you
know,
it's
a...
so,
why
would
you
win
on
that
part?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
what
happens...
you
win
on
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--clothes.
they're
protected
gear.
that's
the
assumption.
that's
part
of
the
job.
the
workday
begins.
but
you
have
to
get
there,
and
you
wait
to
get
the
clothes.
on
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--one,
why
not
skidmore?
why
not
the
reg?
and,
if
so,
why
don't
you
lose
on
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
sometimes
you
have
to
wait?
sometimes
it's
a
minute,
sometimes
it's
nothing.
is
it
like
an
airport?
or
does
the
employer
here
say,
"you
must
show
up
seven
minutes
early,
because
there'll
be
a
wait?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
the
reg
says?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
surprising
i
didn't
see
that
in
the
reg,
if
it
says
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
it's
first
in
the
day.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
first
thing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
day.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
word--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--"#
required"
is
what
i
didn't
understand
in
that.
my
airline
example,
what's
required?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"required"
is...
sometimes
there's
a
wait,
sometimes
there's
not
a
wait.
is
that
required?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
has
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--put
on
his
uniform.
and
sometimes
there's
a
wait,
sometimes
there's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
a
wait.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
a
required...
or
not?
and,
if
it
is,
where
does
it
say
that
in
the
regs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
have
to
decide
the
second
question?
i
think
it's
actually
quite
difficult.
i
can
find
a
lot
of
authority
that
seems
to
me
just
a
random--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
mean
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is
there...
is
there
a
basis
in
this
record...
will
it
make
a
difference?
it's
not
really
well
briefed,
i
don't
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
thorough
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
do
things
on
the
ground--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'd
like
it
or
not.
