mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case.
one
concerns
walking
time,
and
the
other
concerns
waiting
time.
and
unless
the
court
has
a
different
order,
i'd
propose
to
start
with
the
walking
time.
section
4(a)(1)'s
language,
which
comes
from
the
portal
to
portal
act,
which
was
enacted
in
1947,
by
its
plain
terms
clearly
covers
the
walking
that's
involved
in
these
two
cases.
the
statute,
which
is
reproduced
at
the
appendix
of
the
petition,
at
88(a),
says
that
there
is
no
mandatory
compensation
for,
quote,
"walking
to
and
from
the
actual
place
of
performance
of
the
principal
activity
or
activities
which
such
employee
is
employed
to
perform.
"
it's
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
language
that
could
more
directly
cover
what
we're
dealing
with
in
this
particular
case,
because
the
plaintiffs
here
are...
for
ibp...
are
employed
to
slaughter
and
to
process
beef.
the
employees
at
barber
foods
are
employed
to
process
chicken.
and
thus,
the
actual
place
where
they
perform
those
services
are
obviously
on
the
lines
where
the
processing
takes
place.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
know
that
we've...
i
don't
know
of
any
case
where
this
court
has
held
otherwise.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
this
court
said
that
donning
and
doffing
was
a
principal
activity
in
contradistinction
to
a
preliminary
or
postliminary
activity
for
purposes
of
section
4(a)(2),
but
the
court
specifically
said,
in
steiner,
that
that
holding
does
not
apply
to
matters
that
are
specifically
excluded
under
section
4(a)(1),
which
deals
with
walking
time,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
for...
no,
i
don't
think
it's
irrelevant
to
the
workplace.
i
think
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case,
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
the
continuous
workday
rule.
the
question
is,
when
does
the
workday
begin?
and
our
assessment
of
the
workday,
as
defined
in
section
4(a)(1),
which
controls,
specifically,
the
walking
time
in
this
particular
case,
begins
when
you
arrive
at
the
actual
place
where
you're
going
to
perform
the
services--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--or
primary
activities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
sensible
and
a
clear
bright
line
rule,
justice
souter,
to
say
that
when
you
arrive
at
the
actual
place
where
you
perform,
not
just
any
activities,
and
not
just
activities
that
are
integral
and
indispensable
to
your
working
activities,
but
to
the
principal
activities
for
which
you're
hired...
and,
admittedly,
there
can
be
more
than
one
of
those,
but
that
doesn't...
you
know,
donning
and
doffing
is
not
a
principal
activity--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
anyone
who's
cutting
beef.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
they
don't
have
to
principal
activities.
they're
better
understood
as--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
problem
with
that
analysis
is
that
the
court
was
only
analyzing
section
4(a)(2)
for
these
purposes.
and
what
it
was
saying
is,
"we
are
prepared
to
accept
that
there
are
certain
activities
that
are
either
preliminary
or
postliminary,
and
then
there
are
others
that
are
primary
activities.
"
"and
if
you
are
integral
and
indispensable
to
a
primary
activity,
it
is
a
compensable
event.
"
recognizing
that
steiner
is
probably
the
most
extraordinarily
extreme
facts
that
you
could
imagine,
because
we're
talking
about
clothings
that
had...
clothing
that
had
to
be
changed
in
order
to
protect
the
public--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--health
and
safety.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
you
have
to
read
the
language
(a)(1)
within
the
context
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
by
the
portal
to
portal
act,
which
was
to
absolutely
and
categorically
exclude
walking
time
from
being
part
of
mandatorily
compensated
activities
of
a
particular
employee.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but,
justice
ginsburg,
if
you
step
back
and
think
about
this
language
in
the
context
of
the
words
that
are
written
here,
it
says,
"walking
to
and
from
the
actual
place
of
performance
of
the
principal
activity.
"
no
one
would
think
that
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--or
activities.
but,
again,
justice
souter,
all
that
suggests
is
that
there
are
times
when
somebody
who's
working
in
a
clothing
operation
may...
you
know,
may
spend
time
distributing
the
cloth
or
may
spend
time
actually
sewing
the
cloth.
those
are
two
separate
activities.
they're
different
activities.
but
it
doesn't
mean...
and
it
certainly
doesn't
convert
anything
that
had...
can
be
described
as
"integral
and
indispensable"
into
a
primary
activity
which
such
employee
is
employed
to
perform.
no
employee,
in
these
cases,
was
employed
to
perform
the
act
of
putting
on
clothes
or
the
act
of
picking
up
equipment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
are
two
parts
about
that
that
are
worth
focusing
on.
one
is,
i
don't
think
you
can
lump
the
two
cases
together,
because
the
clothing
or
the
equipment
that
has
to
be
put
on
with
respect
to
the
barber
foods
company
is
barely...
is
quite
minimal
and,
indeed,
is
deemed
to
be
diminimus.
so,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
you
can
lump
the
two
cases
together
in
that
way.
but
also,
in
terms
of
where
the
secretary
comes
out
on
this,
let's
not
forget
79.7(g),
footnote
49,
which
is,
candidly,
the
clearest
statement
from
the
secretary
with
respect
to,
what
do
you
do
when
you
have
donning
and
doffing
that
is
followed
by
walking
time?
and
what
does
the...
and
what
does
the
regulation
specifically
say?
and
that's
on,
i
think,
92
and
93
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition.
it
specifically
says
that
that
walking
time
is
not
excluded,
not
necessarily--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
except
that,
under
their
theory
of
this
case,
it
is
always
excluded.
always.
so
that
whatever
else
you
can
say
about
the
meaning
of
that
particular
language,
the
interpretation
the
secretary
offers
to
you
today
flatly
rejects--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
language.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
but...
and
if
we
were
talking
about
that
in
the
context
of
other
kinds
of
activities...
if
you're
back
in
the
(a)(2)
world
of
looking
at
whether
something's
preliminary
or
postliminary,
i
have
less
of
a
problem
with
dealing
with
that.
the
problem
is,
here
we're
talking
about
(a)(1)
activities,
the
core
of
what
congress
enacted
the
portal
to
portal
act
to
protect
employers
for.
the
portal
to
portal
act
is
not
a
statute
that
remotely
provides
protections
for
the
employees.
this
is
a
statute
that
was
designed
to
protect
employers
from
billions
of
dollars
of
liability.
and
so,
when
you're
talking
about,
"under
what
circumstances
can
you
ignore
the
flat
prohibition
on
requiring
walking
time
to
be
regarded
as
a
mandatory
subject
of
compensation?
"
then
it
seems
to
me
the
distinction
you're
proposing
doesn't
work.
and
it's
also,
justice
breyer,
again,
flatly
inconsistent.
their...
that's
not
their
theory
of
the
case.
their
theory
of
the
case
is,
"if
we
can
describe
it
as
in
any
way
integral
and
indispensable
to
some
other
activity,
that
makes
it
a
primary
activity,
that
starts
the
workday,
and
everything
after
that
then
becomes
compensable.
"
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
you
skipped
over
"actual
place",
there--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
scalia,
but...
which
i
think
is
an
important--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--word.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
when
the
court
was
interpreting
(a)(2)
in
steiner,
it
wasn't
interpreting
(a)(2)
to
determine
whether
something
was
a
preliminary
or
postliminary
activity
in
connection
with
"said
preliminary...
primary
activities".
what
it
was
saying
is,
these
are
not
preliminary
and
postliminary
activities,
that
they
are
excluded
from
that.
and
so,
the
court's
really
coming
up
with
what
is
a
third
category
of
cases,
which
deals
with
integral
and
indispensable
activities
to
a
primary
activity.
they
didn't
have
to
analyze
it
as
a
primary
activity.
all
they
had
to
say
was,
it's
not...
that
the
preliminary
and
postliminary
activities
are
not
simply
temporal,
that
there
is
a
substantive
component
to
it.
and
that
is
essentially
the
holding
of
the
court
in
steiner.
it
says
there's
a
substantive
component;
and,
therefore,
we're
not
going
to
just
simply
look
in...
time
wise,
whether
it
comes
before
or
after
principal
activities.
we're
going
to
decide
that
there
are
some...
there
are
some
situations
that
are
so
important
that
they
need
to
be
compensated
under
(a)(2),
because
they
don't
fall
within
preliminary
or
postliminary
language.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
work--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
mandatorily
compensable
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
remember,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
under
this
court's
interpretations
from
mt.
clemens
pottery
and
the
cases
that
preceded
it,
i
mean,
it...
you
know,
it
had
a
very
sweeping
definition
of
what
is
work
within
the
meaning...
within
the
meaning
of
what
is
compensable
as
minimum
wages
and
as
overtime.
and
that's
in
place.
and
now
congress
has
stepped
in
and
said,
"well,
wait
a
second.
"
"when
we
did
it...
when
that
got
interpreted
that
broadly,
we're
talking
about
$6
billion
in
liability.
"
so,
it's
very
important,
given
that
we're
talking
about
fairly
minimal
activities
on
the...
on
the...
that
are
involved
here,
triggering
potentially
massive
liabilities.
and
so,
what
we've
done
is,
we've
excluded
from
those
massive
liabilities
the
walking,
riding,
and
traveling
time,
because
that's
the
basis
on
which
you
end
up
with
big
numbers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
i
mean,
that...
but
that's...
this
court's
decision
in
steiner
was
the
one
that
reached
out
to
decide
that
"integral
and
indispensable"
was
a
category
of
activities
that
were
going
to
be
compensable,
even
though,
on
the
face
of
them,
they
may
have
appeared
to
be--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
think
that
creates
any
particular
problem,
but
what
you
end
up
doing,
mr.--
chief
justice,
under
those
circumstances,
is,
you
completely
eliminate
the
protection
that
congress
meant
to
provide
here
for
walking,
riding,
and
traveling
time,
which
is...
which
is
a
vital
consideration--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you
mean
after
they've--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--arrived
at
the
actual
place--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
once
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
the
argument
that
once
you,
for
the
first
time,
arrive
at
your
actual
place
of
performing
the
principal
activity
for
which
you
were
hired,
which
is
cutting
beef
or
whatever
it
happens
to
be
in
your
hypothetical...
once
you
arrive
there,
that
does
begin
the
workday.
that's
the
definition
of
what
starts
the
workday,
which
is
why
i...
to
our
mind,
this
is
a
much
clearer
and
brighter
line
rule.
we
can
tell
you
precisely
when
you
start
the
workday.
it's
when
you
get
to
the
place
where
you
got
hired
to
work,
and
start
to
do
that
work.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
you
do
have
compensated...
and
that's
true
for
lots
of
different
situations,
justice
kennedy.
you
could
have
a
situation
where
you
go
home,
and
you
get
called
back
in
on
an
emergency,
and
nobody
disputes
that
that's
clearly
compensable
time,
and
nobody
has
ever
seriously
argued
that
you
ought
to
extend
the
workday--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you
know,
it's...
it's
very
possible
that
the
scrubbing
will
be
regarded
as
an
integral
and
indispensable
part
of
the...
of
the...
of
the
employment,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--therefore,
it's
compensable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
walk
is
not
compensable,
because
congress
didn't
want
you
to
have
walking
until
you
got
to
the
actual
place
where
you
would
perform
the
services.
and
nobody's
principal
activity
as
an
employee
is
to
go
take
a
shower
or
to
go
and
pick
up
certain
types
of
clothing.
that's
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
understanding
of
"principal
activity".
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
want
you
to
limit
steiner
to
the
very
unusual
facts
that
arose
in
that
particular
context.
i...
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
the
"indispensable
and
integral"
test
as
a
reason
for
beginning...
as
a
reason
for
compensating
certain
activities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
what
we
do--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no,
i...
the
notion
that
if
you
didn't
shower
and
change,
you
would
expose
not
only
yourself,
but
your
family
and
everybody
else
to
the
risks
of
lead
poisoning
is
a
pretty
extraordinary--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--circumstance.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
well,
i
would...
i
would
argue
that
you
could
make
a...
you
could
make
a
claim
that
none
of
that
donning
and
doffing
ought
to
be
compensable.
and,
candidly,
we've
made
that
argument.
but,
unfortunately,
the
court
didn't
grant
the
petition
on
that
particular...
on
that
particular
question.
so,
we
have
to
take
it
as
a
given.
but
i
don't...
i
don't...
i...
for
exactly
the
reason
you
identify,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
does
create
a
problem.
i
mean,
part
of
this
problem
is
a
bit
contrived.
i
don't
think
that
the
ordinary
donning
and
doffing
ought
to
trigger
the
beginning
of
the
workday.
but,
assuming
that
it
does--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
still
don't
think...
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i
still
don't
think
that,
even
if
you
accept
that
that
is
compensable
conduct
within
the
meaning
of
steiner,
which
i...
that's
what
it's
talking
about...
but
steiner,
justice
o'connor,
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
fact
that
there
was
going
to
have
to
be
walking
or
traveling,
or
the
workday.
the
court,
in
steiner,
clearly
had
in
mind
the
workplace,
where
you're
producing
batteries.
there's
a
lot
of
language
in
that
opinion
that
says,
"this
is
where
you
really
do
the
work.
"
that's
your
battery,
and
here's
where
you're
going
to
get...
engage
in
activities
that
we
think
you
need
to
be
compensated.
"but
the
court
never
remotely
suggested
that
you
were
entitled
to
the
walking
time
between
those
two.
"
and,
if
you
go
back
to
790.7(g),
that
language
specifically
told
every
employer
that
simply
because
you
have
to
pay
for
certain
kinds
of
activities
at
the
outset,
because
they're
integral
and
indispensable,
as
decided
by
a
court,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
you
have
to
pay
for
all
the
walking
time.
and
so,
you've
got
to
come
up
with--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--a
theory
that
supports
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
sharpening
tools
is
the
easiest
one,
because
you
do
that
right
on
your
workplace.
i
mean,
that's
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
its
legislative
history--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
again,
if
the
court
decided
that
sharpening
the
tools,
even
though
it's
done
not
at
the
same
time,
which
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it...
when
it
identified
that
hypothetical...
but,
even
if
you
assume
that,
that
that's
integral
and
indispensable,
it
still
isn't
what
triggers
the
time
for
starting
the
actual
employment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
can
accept
that
identity
for
purposes
of
distinguishing
between
what's
preliminary
and
postliminary
activity.
what
i
cannot
do
is
to...
is
embrace
that
for
purposes
of
deciding
when
walking
time/traveling
time
ought
to
be
included.
congress
was
as
plain
as
it
could
humanly
be
in
saying
that,
"we're
not
going
to
allow
walking
and
traveling
time
to
be
included
in
an
unexpected
fashion.
"
and
that
is
precisely...
as
the
chamber
of
commerce
brief
says,
that
is
precisely
what
we're
talking
about
here.
and,
candidly,
as
judge
boudin
said
in
his
concurring
opinion,
the
circumstances
arising
in
this
context
bear
a
very
eery
resemblance
to
the
situation
that
gave
rise
to
the
portal
to
portal
act
in
the
first
place.
and
so...
and
i
think
it's
important
to
put
this
into
context.
you
know,
the
language
of
the
statute,
as
i
read
it,
clearly
is
in
our
favor.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
clearly
in
our
favor.
and
then
the
question
is,
did
this
court,
in
a
decision
that
dealt
solely
with
4(a)(2),
mean
to
vastly
change
the
scope
of
4(a)(1)
in
a
way
that
would
dramatically
expose
employers
to
liability--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
the...
well,
in
part,
because
plants
are
not...
have
never
been
designed...
remember,
we've
got
79.6...
the
secretary
of
labor
told
employers
for
50
years,
"you
can
set
up
your
plant
without
fearing
that
you're
going
to
suddenly
be
hit
with
walking
time
after
somebody
engages
in
donning
and
doffing,
even
if
it
turns
out
to
be
integral
and
indispensable.
"
for
50
years,
they
followed
that
advice.
they
set
up
all
of
their
plants
with
that
expectation.
and
now
this
court,--
if
it
follows
the
ninth
circuit's
lead,
will
suddenly
say,
"okay,
what
you
need
to
go
out
and
find
is
all
of
the
integral
and
indispensable
activities.
"
--not
just
donning
and
doffing...
any
integral
and
indispensable
activity
that
you
can
get
a
court
to
buy
into,
that
will
start
this
ever
expanding
workday,
such
that
any
walking
that
goes
on
after
that
and
before
you
get
done
with
all
of
these
ever
expanding
post
doffing
activities.
then
you
have
the...
that's...
you
know,
so
you
have
this
broad...
and
that's
why
you're
going
to
have
these...
substantially
greater
and
totally
unexpected
liabilities
on--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--790.7(g),
footnote
49,
and
it
says,
as--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--plain
as
day--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but...
there...
there,
it
means
always.
always.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i'm
prepared
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
might,
and...
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but,
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
secretary
does.
i
don't
know
whether
the
plaintiffs
necessarily
do.
and
certainly
the
plaintiffs
in
those
cases
didn't.
they
took
the
position
that
the
workday
started
as
soon
as
you
engaged
in
protecting
the
canines,
just
as
in...
insurance
industry,
they...
the
insurance
adjusters
are
all
taking
the
position
that
as
soon
as
they
have
to
get
on
the
computer,
that's
an
integral
and
indispensable
part
of
their
day,
and
everything
after
that,
including
traveling
and
movement,
are
all
part
and
parcel
of
what
gets
added
in
there.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
once
you
go
down
this
path
and
you
say,
"okay,
we're
going
to
define
the
workday
by
reference
to
whatever
somebody
determines
is
integral
and
indispensable.
"
you
are
going
to
have
an
expandable
workday,
and
that
if
you
are
really
looking
for
a
fairly
clear
rule,
you
sit...
you
stick
with
what
the
language
of
the
statute
says,
which
is,
the
actual
place
of
the
performance
of
the
activity
for
which
you
were
hired.
once
you've
got
that
in
place...
that's
not
to
say
that's
the
full
length
of
when
you
get
compensated.
you
can
be
compensated
for
activities
outside
of
that
workday.
happens
every
day,
when
you
have
to
come
in
for
an
emergency
or
if
you
have
to
come
in--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
understand
the
problem
with
steiner,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
think
it
is
inappropriate
to
read
steiner,
which
says,
point
blank,
"our
holding
does
not
deal
with
conduct
that
is
specifically
excluded
by
4(a)(1).
"
and
then...
and
ignore
that.
that
whole...
that
statement
of
the
holding
of
the
court
seems
to
me
to
say,
"all
we're
telling
you
the
answer
to--
"
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--4(a)(2)>
["].
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
you
can
get
to
the
logic
of
that.
the
question
is,
is
it
appropriate
to
apply
the
4(a)(1)
and
the
fundamentally
important
values
that
it
was
designed
to
serve?
and
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is,
that's
a
mistake.
and
we
know
that,
because
the
regs
protected
us
against
this
precise
event.
it
is
exactly
what
the
portal
to
portal
act
was
designed
to
accomplish,
and
it's
the
better
interpretation
of
this
particular
statute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
ibp.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
they
don't
argue
that
it's
moot.
and
it's
not
purely
academic.
there
are
collateral
consequences
to
deciding
what
the
federal
law
issue
is
in
this
particular
context.
we
briefed
this
issue
a
the
cert
stage
at
some
length,
and
the
court
granted
cert,
so
i'm
assuming
that,
in
some
respects,
you,
sort
of,
pass
by
that
particular
problem.
there
are
collateral
consequences.
and
the
other
side,
again,
doesn't
say
it's...
that
it
has
mooted
this
case;
it
simply
says
that
there's
this
serious
issue
on
remand
as
to
precisely
how
it'll
all
play
out.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yeah,
because
it...
reas
judicata
collateral
estoppel
effects
from
the
ruling
that
we've...
that
we
have
violated
federal
law,
both
that
might
be
available
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
otherwise.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--balance
of
my
minutes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
have
a
couple
of
points
i'd
like
to
make.
first,
justice
breyer,
i
want
to
start
with
the
waiting
times.
i
didn't
actually
have
an
opportunity
to
spend
much
time
talking
about
them.
but
i
think
the
answer
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
offered
with
respect
to
the
waiting
time
simply
illustrates
the
expandable
nature
of
the
workday.
their
position--
justice
ginsburg...
or
justice
o'connor
specifically
asked
that
question,
"you're
not
saying
that
waiting
time
prior
to
engaging
in
a
primary
activity,
in
fact,
starts
the
workday.
"
and
the
answer
is,
absolutely,
it
does,
because
they
find
that
everything
that
is
integral
and
indispensable
triggers
the
start
of
the
workday.
so,
put
it
into
fairly
graphic
terms.
if
you
have
to
show
up
in
order
to
put
on
a
coat
in
order
to
go
onto
the
floor
in
order
to
do
your
services,
then
the
waiting
time
for
that
coat
counts.
if,
however,
you
also
have
to
put
in
earplugs
in
order
to
get
to
the
place
where
you
have
to
get
the
coat,
not
only
do
putting
in
the
earplugs
count,
under
that
theory,
but,
if
you
have
to
wait,
you
have
that,
and
that
extends
the
workday,
and
all
of
the
walking
in
between
that.
so,
if
you're
asking,
"is
this
going
to
become
a
significant
liability?
"
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
for
very
significant
compensable
acts...
and,
indeed,
in
this
context,
some
of
those
compensable
acts
were
found
by
the
jury
to
be
utterly
diminimus...
you're
going
to
end
up
with
significant
waiting
time,
and
you're
going
to
end
up
with
significant
walking
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
o'connor,
they
specifically
held
that
all
of
the
waiting
time
is
not--
it
is
to
excluded.
and
they
did
that
on
the
basis
of
790.7(g),
before
you
get
to
the
footnote...
because
that's
the
tag
to
the
footnote...
as
to
what
is...
what
is
the
ordinary
meaning
of
wait...
of
preliminary
and
postliminary
for
waiting
time?
and
the
expectation
is
that
if
you're
waiting
to
get
your
check,
and
if
you're
waiting
to
check
in,
the
recognition
is
that
those...
those
are
completely
fortuitous,
just
as
it
is
here.
there's
nobody
who
structured
this
arrangement
so
that
you
will
end
up
spending
time
waiting.
indeed,
the
scheme
is
designed
to
get
people
in
as
efficiently--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
possible.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
if
they
specifically
decide
that
there
is
no
waiting
time
that's
covered
here,
and
the
plaintiffs
have
sought
compensation
for
both
pre
and
post
waiting
time,
then
the
issue
is
squarely
posed,
and
they've
certainly
posed
it
in
their
petition,
and
the
court
granted
it.
so,
again,
obviously,
you're
free
to
decline
to
decide
issues,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
one
is
posed.
i
want
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but
that
just
goes
to
the
question...
i
think
it
disposes
of
the
issue
of,
if
you
have
waiting
time
that
otherwise
looks
to
be
fairly
ordinary
preliminary/postliminary
activity,
it,
nevertheless,
can
be
converted
into
primary
activity
under
their
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
they
clearly
suggest
that
the
answer
is
yes.
our
suggestion
is,
that's
inconsistent
with
the
way
waiting
time
is
handled
under
the
regulations;
and,
therefore,
the
answer
clearly
should
be
no.
and,
at
a
minimum,
the
court
ought
to
affirm
that
part
of
the
tum
decision.
with
respect
to
the
holding
of
steiner...
i
mean,
it's
important
to
put
in
mind,
steiner...
one
of
the
things...
two
things
that
steiner
focused
on...
it
focused
on
section
3.0,
and
it
recognized
that
there
are
going
to
be
situations
where
you're
going
to
be
able
to
bargain
away
clothes
changing.
and
so,
then
you're
in
a
situation
where,
for
some...
for...
in
some
circumstances,
because
you've
bargained
away
compensation
for
clothes
changing,
walking
that
takes
place
before
or
after
that
will
never
be
compensable;
in
other
situations,
it
will
be
compensable.
that's
an
absurd
outcome
in
a
situation
where
congress
clearly
had
one
thing
in
mind
that
it
absolutely
wanted
to
accomplish,
and
that
was
to
ensure
that
walking,
riding,
traveling
to
the
place
where
you
actually
perform
the
services
for
which
you've
been
hired,
has
been...
has...
is
excluded
from
being
mandatorily
compensated...
steiner
doesn't
deal
with
4(a)(1);
the
language
is
as
plain
as
it
can
be...
are
not...
you
know,
unless
specifically
excluded
by
section
4(a)(1).
thank
you,
your
honors.
