chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
court
will
now
hear
argument
in
ibp,
inc.
vs.
alvarez
and
tum
vs.
barber
foods,
inc.--
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
your
approach
introduces,
really,
a
third
concept.
you
have
the
principal
activities
in
your...
either
preliminary
or
postliminary...
and
now
you've
got
a
third
concept:
integral.
but
the
statute...
that's
nowhere
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
unless
they
were
saying
those
activities
were,
in
fact,
principal
activities.
if
it's
integral,
if
it's
embraced
by
the
principal
activity,
it
is
a
principal
activity,
and
that
at
least
is
more
consistent
with
the
statute
in
keeping
it
in
two
categories
rather
than
inventing
a
third.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
does...
how
does
your
analysis
apply?
let's
say
these
employees
had
to
change
their
equipment
several
times
during
the
course
of
the
day.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
i
mean,
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
equipment
is
only
good
for,
you
know,
an
hour,
two
hours,
then
they
have
to
get
new
ones.
they
have
to
walk
back
to
the
place--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they
have
to
doff
the
other
equipment,
don
new
equipment,
and
walk
back.
wouldn't
your
analysis
say
that
that
walking
time
is
excluded?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
unusual
about
the
facts--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
was
so
unusual
about
the
facts
in
steiner?
they're
pretty
common.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
routine
where
you
have
to
don,
you
know,
safety
equipment,
and
you
have
to
shower
when
you're
done,
whether
it's
being...
the
meatpacking
or
the
stuff
at
steiner...
that's
a
pretty
common
occurrence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
they
don't
say...
i
mean,
they
exclude,
for
example,
the
canine
cases,
where
you
have
to
walk
and
feed
the
dog
in
the
morning
before
you
show
up
at
work.
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they're
not
saying
only--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--answer
to
justice
kennedy
said
that
the
dog
cases
were
distinguishable
because
there
was
a
break
in
the
principal
activity.
so,
if
we
were
to
rule
in
your
favor,
all
the
employer
has
to
do
is
make
sure
that
the
donning
and
doffing
station's
far
enough
away
from
the
production
line
so
that
there
will
be
a
sufficient
break
between
the
two
activities.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
"it
would
be"...
that's
my
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
mr.
gornstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
gornstein,
do
you
agree
that
just
because
it's
a
compensable
activity
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
there
isn't
going
to
be
a
break
in
the
workday?
people
have
talked
about
the
dog
example,
and
there
are
others.
i
mean,
and...
so,
all
you're
talking
about
is
the
determination
that
this
is
a
principal
activity.
it
seems
that
there's
a
separate...
second
question,
such
as,
how
do
we
tell
if
the
space
in
time
between
two
different
principal
activities,
because
they're
two
very
different
types
of
activities,
is
a
break
or
part
of
the
continuous
workday?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.--
gornstein.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
in
no.
03-1238,
ibp
versus
alvarez,
and
no.
04-66,
tum
versus
barber
foods.
