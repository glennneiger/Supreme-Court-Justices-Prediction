mr.
phillips,
i...
the
steiner
opinion
explicitly
agreed
with
the
lower
court
in
that
case,
which
said
that
the
term
"principal
activity
or
activities"
embraces
all
activities
that
are
integral
and
indispensable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if...
if
you
think
that
putting
on
the
clothes
fall
within
that,
then
that
covers
walking,
too--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--after
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
problem--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
phillips,
the
problem
i
continue
to
have
is
that
i
thought
steiner
embraced,
explicitly,
the
notion
that
principal
activity
embraces
all
activities
that
are
integral
and
indispensable.
you
take
issue
with
that,
but
do
you
want
us
to
overrule
steiner--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
make
some
changes
in
it?
i
just
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gornstein,
what
about
in
the
tum
case,
the
walking
and
waiting
before
the
donning
of
the
clothes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
talking
about
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--these.
the
initial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
that's
covered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
the
pre
donning
waiting
issue
decided
below?
