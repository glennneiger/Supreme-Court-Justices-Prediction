justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--assumes
that
there
is
only
one
actual
place.
and
their
argument,
which
is
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
statute,
is
that
there
may
be
more
than
one
principal
activity,
and
hence,
more
than
one
place.
and
if
the...
if
the
place
of
donning
and
doffing
is
such
a
place,
then
wouldn't
it
be
at
least
administratively
odd
to
apply
the
continuous
workday
rule
immediately
to
exclude
some
walking
time
that
follows
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you're
saying
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
called
"integral
activities"
are
not
principal
activities.
justice
david
h.
souter
"or
activities".
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
no,
i
didn't
mean...
finish.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
your...
in
the
answer
that
you
just
gave,
and
an
answer
which
you
have,
in
fact,
consistently
repeated,
inconsistent
with
steiner...
steiner
didn't
say
there
is
a
separate
category
of
integral
activities.
steiner
said
that
activities
which
are
integral
are
part
of
the
principal
activity.
and
isn't
your
argument
premised
on
denying
that
identity?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
give
us
a
collateral
consequence--
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
you
then
agree
that
the
answer
for
which
you
argue
here
follows
not
merely
from
the
text
of
4(a),
but
the
text
of
4(a)
plus
a
continuous...
some
variety
of
a
continuous
workday
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
you've
got
to
have
both.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
don't...
but
you
don't
get
the
answer
from
simply
the
text
itself.
