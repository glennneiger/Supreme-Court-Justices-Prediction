justice
john
paul
stevens
these
cases
are
consolidated,
and
they
come
to
us,
respectively,
from
the
9th
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
1st
circuit
court
of
appeals.
employees
at
the
food-processing
plants
involved
in
the
cases
are
required
to
wear
certain
protective
gear
supplied
by
their
employers
while
they
are
working
on
the
assembly
line.
the
cases
require
us
to
decide
whether
the
time
spent
walking
to
the
assembly
line
from
the
place
where
they
donned
their
protective
gear
and
the
time
spent
waiting
to
don
that
gear
are
part
of
the
workday
that
is
compensable
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
1938,
as
amended
by
the
portal-to-portal
act
of
1947.
for
reasons
stated
in
a
remarkably
interesting,
20-page
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
the
post-donning
walking
time
is
compensable,
but
the
pre-donning
waiting
time
is
not.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit,
and
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
at
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
1st
circuit.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
