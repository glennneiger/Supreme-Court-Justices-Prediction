justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
phillips--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
asking
us
to
interpret
the
same
words,
(2)
that
was
at
issue
in
steiner,
and
in
sub
(1),
and
then
the
clause
that
follows
both
of
those.
the
same
phrase
is
used.
so
if
(2),
why
wouldn't
the
same
follow
for
sub
(1)
and
the
following
clauses?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is
included
if
it's...
once
the
workday
begins,
if
there's
a
rotation,
you
walk
from
one
station
to
the
other.
that
walking
time,
i
think
it's
conceded,
would
be
included.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
if
your
date...
if
the
principal
activity
is
donning
and
doffing,
then
the
walking
time
thereafter
would
also
be
included.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
phillips,
it
says
it...
either
something
is
before...
preliminary;
or
after...
postliminary.
and
if
it's
neither
of
those,
then,
it
seems
to
me,
it
fits...
it's
not
before
the
principal
activity,
and
it's
not
after
the
principal
activity,
so
what
else
is
it,
other
than
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--principal
activity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
is
it
so
dramatic,
if
we
recognize
that
nothing
begins
until
the
donning
and
doffing...
that
is,
the
travel
to
wherever
you
don
and
doff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
none
of
that
is
included,
even
from
the
plant
gate
to
the
place
where
you
don
and
doff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
may
i
just
ask
you
a
preliminary
question
about
the
ibm
case...
ip...
ibp--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ibp
case?
as
i
understand
it,
whatever
we
do
here
is
irrelevant
to
what
the
bottom
line
is
going
to
be
in
that
case,
because
the
determination
is
going
to
be
made
only
under
state
law.
the
court
below
said
that's
what
it
was
going
to
do.
and
the
employees
are
not
objecting.
so,
it
seems
that
that
case,
as
distinguished
from
tum,
is
really
not
anything
that
this
court
should
decide,
because
it
would
be
academic.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
i
just
wanted
to
have
a
clear
answer
to
the
question
justice
scalia
asked
you.
is
it
so
that
collective
bargaining
could
not
trade
off
the
compensation
for
the
walking
and
the
donning
and
doffing
for
some
other
benefit
that
the
employees
might
prefer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you
say
it's
an
open
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--about
what
gear
qualifies?
that
is,
here
we
have
no
dispute
that
this
is
protective
gear.
but
it's
not
any
changing
that
counts.
so,
how
do
we
know
whether
this
is
the
kind
of
donning
and
doffing
that's
compensated
in...
or
the
kind
that
isn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
wasn't
decided
below,
was
it?
it
was
just
a
question
of
walking
and
waiting,
and
they
weren't
specific
about
whether
that
included
waiting
or
walking,
pre
donning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
perhaps
we
shouldn't
reach
a
question
that
hasn't
been
aired
and
decided
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
wasn't
questioning
that,
so
much
as
it
is...
it
is
extraordinary
for
this
court
to
take
a
case
when
the
bottom
line
is
going
to
be
the
same.
and,
since
we
have
the
identical
issues,
with
no
such
preliminary
question
in
tum,
if
we
decide
in
your
favor
in
the
tum
case,
then
the
other
case
is
taken
care
of.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein
acknowledged
that
that
issue,
the
pre
donning
wait,
was
not
decided
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wasn't,
obviously,
decided
in
the
first
circuit,
because
they
ruled
against
the
employee's
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
but
the
question
of
when...
what
waiting
are
we
talking
about?
before
the
principal
activity
or
only
after?
that
specific
issue,
as
i
understand
it,
was
not
aired
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gornstein,
one
thing
i'm
curious
about.
with
all
the
trouble
of
various
interpretations
and
famous
footnote
49--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why,
in
all
these
years,
hasn't
the
department
of
labor
gotten
rid
of
it?
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
decided--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no
waiting
time.
they
didn't
decide
"if"
waiting
time...
"which"
waiting
time.
but
they
said
no...
it's
irrelevant
whether
it's
before
or
after,
because
waiting
time
isn't
covered.
so,
i
don't
see
how
they
specifically
decided,
yes,
waiting
time
is
covered,
but
not
pre
donning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
seems
the
court
below
said
waiting
time
isn't
covered,
so
we're
not
going
to
engage
in
any
debate
about
what...
if
waiting
time
is...
were
covered,
which
waiting
time?
