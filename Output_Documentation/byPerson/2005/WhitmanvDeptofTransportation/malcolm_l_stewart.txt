mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
although
congress
has
not
clearly
expressed
an
intent
to
foreclose
all
judicial
review
of
petitioner's
constitutional
claim,
such
review
should
be
conducted
in
a
manner
that
is
as
consistent
as
possible
with
the
text
and
structure
of
the
csra.
because
petitioner
failed
to
invoke
the
grievance
procedures
of
the
applicable
collective
bargaining
agreement,
his
suit
was
properly
dismissed.
and
if
i
may,
just
in
a...
a
moment
or
two,
summarize
the
government's
position
as
to
the
steps
that
an
individual
in
petitioner's
position
would
have
to
take
in
order
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
a
constitutional
claim
like
this
one.
first,
the
employee
must
make
all
reasonable
efforts
to
utilize
the
available
administrative
remedies
under
the
csra
itself,
including
any
applicable
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so
in
this
instance,
the
first
two
steps
of
the
grievance
process,
talking
to
the
immediate
supervisor
and
then
to
the
facility
manager,
would
have
been
within
petitioner's
control.
and
if
those
steps
had
proven
unavailing,
petitioner
should
have
requested
that
the
union
take
the
case
to
arbitration,
and
then,
if
necessary,
to
the
flra.
second,
if
at
the
end
of
the
administrative
process
an
avenue
of
judicial
review
is
available
under
the
csra
itself,
the
employee
must
seek
relief
pursuant
to
that
provision.
and
i
think
petitioner
really
concedes
that
point
to
be
true;
that
is,
if
petitioner
were
raising
a
constitutional
challenge
to
a
major
adverse
action,
such
as
dismissal,
petitioner
concedes
not
only
that
he
would
have
been
required
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
by...
by
appealing
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
but
petitioner
also
concedes
that
we...
he
would
have
had
to
seek
judicial
review
in
the
manner
specified
by
the
csra,
that
is,
by
filing
a
petition
for
review
of
the
mspb's
decision
in
the
federal
circuit,
rather
than
proceeding
directly
to
district
court.
and
finally,
our
position
is
that
if
at
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
process,
judicial
review
is
unavailable
under
the
csra,
the
employee
may
then
obtain
review
of
his
constitutional
challenge
alone
in
district
court,
pursuant
to
the
administrative
procedure...
procedure
act.
now,
in
some
sense,
there
is
an
element
of
untidiness
in
our
position
because
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
reconcile
congress'
intent
to
adopt--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
would
have
been,
at
least
for
this
employee,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
was
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if...
if
he
requests
that
the
union
take
the
grievance
to
arbitration
and
then
to
the
flra
and
the
union
refuses,
our
position
would
be
that
he
could
then
file
suit
in
federal
district
court
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
on
his
constitutional
challenge
alone.
that
is,
we
think
on
the
one--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
would
be
in
the
district
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
is
if
the
union
does
not
agree
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration
and
then
to
the
flra.
if--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
is
in
part
one
of
timing,
but
it's
not
one
of
timing
alone.
that
is,
our
position
is
if
mr.
whitman
had
been
successful
in
prevailing
upon
the
union
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration
and
then
to
the
flra,
the
position
we've
taken
in
the
brief
is
that
judicial
review,
if
the
flra
had
rendered
an
unfavorable
decision,
would
most
appropriately
be
accomplished
in
the
court
of
appeals
pursuant
to
the
csra.
but
our
position
is
if
the
union
is
unwilling
to
take
the
grievance
to
the
point
where
the
ruling
can
be
reviewed
under
the
provisions
of
the
csra
itself,
that
the
apa
remains
available
as
a
fall
back.
but
the...
the
fact
that
it's
one
of
timing
doesn't
make
it
an
insignificant
difference.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
first,
certainly
if
congress
had
said
with
absolute
clarity
that
district
court
review
of
claims
like
this
is
precluded,
we
would
defend
the
statute
as
constitutional.
second,
i
agree
with
you
that
the
fairest
reading,
the
most
likely
interpretation
of
congress'
intent
is
that
claims
of
this
nature...
that
is,
complaints
about
aspects
of
the
employment
relationship
that
don't
rise
to
the
level
of
personnel
actions.
the
fairest
reading
of
congress'
intent
is
that
such
suits
would
be
precluded.
however,
this
court
in
a
number
of
prior
decisions
has
required
something
more
than
that
before
inferring
that
congress
has
barred
all
judicial
review
of
a
colorable
constitutional
claim.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
in
some
sense
the
csra--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
i...
i
think
the
flip
side
of
it
is
that
some
of
those
cases
involved
statutes
that
appeared
on
their
face
to
function
as
express
preclusions
of
judicial
review.
here,
we
don't
have
that.
here,
the
argument
as
to
why
administrative
procedure
act
review
is
precluded
is
not
based
on
the
text
of
any
csra
provision
standing
alone.
it's
based--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
know
that
there
was
necessarily
an
intent
to
bifurcate,
but
i
think
we
had
the
same--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
court
had
the
same
situation
in
webster
v.
doe.
that
is,
in
webster
v.
doe,
the
court
concluded
that
given
the
limits
on
review
of
the
cia
director's
employment
decisions
and
given
the
great
sensitivity
of
hiring
and
firing
matters
within
that
agency,
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
simply
no
law
to
apply
in
review
of
the...
the
claimant's
complaint
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
nevertheless,
the
court
concluded
that
judicial
review
of
the
constitutional
challenge
remained
available.
and
the
idea
was
not
so
much
that
congress
itself
had
manifested
an
intent
to
differentiate
between
the
two
types
of
claims.
it
was
that
congress
had
treated
the
two
types
of
claims
the
same
but
that
the
type
of
evidence
that
will
suffice
to
eliminate
judicial
review
of
a
nonconstitutional
claim
is...
it's
less
demanding
than
the
type
that
the
court
would
require
before
eliminating
judicial
review
of
a
constitutional
claim.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
the
statutory
claim
wouldn't
be
before
the
district
court.
again,
if...
if
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
agree
that
it's
an
unusual
system,
but
i
think
it...
and
in
a
sense
the
same
situation
would
have
been
present
in
webster
v.
doe,
that
is,
the
court,
when
it
came
to
review
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
challenge,
wouldn't
have
had
any
possibility
of
deciding
the
case
on
a
nonconstitutional
basis
because
nonconstitutional
challenges
would
be
foreclosed.
now--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there's
no
private
right
of
action
conferred
by
45-108
itself.
now,
in
the
ordinary
case,
when
a
federal
statute
places
limits
on
agency
personnel
and
a
particular
category
of
plaintiffs
falls
within
the
zone
of
interest
that
was
intended
to
be
protected
by
that
provision,
then
even
if
the
statute
that
limits
agency
discretion
itself
doesn't
provide
a
private
right
of
action,
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
entitle
a
claimant
to
get
into
court
and
argue
that
the
agency's
decision
was
contrary
to
law,
namely
the
relevant
statute.
so
if
there
were
no
question
of
csra
conclusion,
we
would
agree
that
the
claimant
could
go
into
court
raising
a
statutory
challenge
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
a
private
right
of
action
in
45-108
itself.
here,
we
think
that
the
evidence
from
the
comprehensive
congressional
scheme
is
sufficient
to
divest
the
courts
of
jurisdiction
over
the
statutory
claim.
we
don't
think
that
congress
has
spoken
with
the
clarity
that
this
court
has
required
to
divest
the
courts
of
jurisdiction
over
the
constitutional
challenge.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
we're
saying
that
he
first
has
to
attempt
to
persuade
the
union
to
seek
arbitration.
that
is,
he
has
to
make
all
reasonable
efforts
to
utilize
the
full
range
of
administrative
remedies.
but
it...
our...
our
position
is
if
the
union
declines
that
request,
then
judicial
review
would
be
available
at
the
end
of
the
day
in
federal
district
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
didn't
characterize
it
as
an
exhaustion
argument.
that
is,
the
district
court
alluded
to
the
petitioner's
failure
to
exhaust
in
dismissing
the
suit.
however,
we...
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
we
have,
up
to
this
point,
litigated
the
merits
of
the
fourth
amendment
dispute
and
then
switched
to
a
threshold
objection
to
adjudication.
we've
always
argued
that
the
suit
was
barred
by
the
csra
scheme,
and
we've
always
pointed
out
that
the
petitioner
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
administrative
remedies
that
were
available
to
him.
really,
the
only
change
in
our
position
is
that
we
have
been
in
the...
in
this
court
have
been
willing
to
acknowledge
that
in
the
hypothetical
case
where
someone
in
petitioner's
position
did
make...
take
full
advantage
or
make
reasonable
efforts
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
administrative
processes,
that
judicial
review
would
be
available.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
they
would
first
have
to
get
into
court
first.
they
would
first--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
mean,
again
with
the
caveat
they
would
first
have
to
avail
themselves
of
the
administrative--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
you're...
you're
correct
that
you
could
do
that
in
the
general
run
of
cases
under
the
administrative--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
in...
in
our
view,
in
harmonizing
the...
the
principle
that
judicial
review--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--will
ordinarily
be
available
for
a
constitutional
claim
with
the
remedial
scheme
established
by
the
csra--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
i
think
you
could
certainly
decide
the
case
on
the
ground
that
an
individual
who
has
made
no
effort
to
utilize
the
grievance
procedures
that
are
available
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
can't
bypass
those
procedures
entirely
by
filing
suit
into...
in
federal
district
court.
and
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
resolve--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
certainly
to...
i
mean,
that
is,
justifiably
to
impose
an
exhaustion
requirement,
the
court
would
have
to
find
that
the...
the
exhaustion
principle
is
in
some
sense
implicit
in
the
csra.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
i
think
if
there's
ample
basis
for
the
court
to
do
that...
that
is,
one
of
the
noteworthy
features
of
the
csra
is
that
the
act
authorizes
judicial
review
of
a
wide
category
of
government
actions
in
different
courts
under
different
circumstances.
but
there's
no
provision
of
the
csra
that
ever
gives
a
plaintiff
a
right
of
immediate
access
to
a
federal
district
court.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
it's
clear...
it...
it
is
clear
and
undisputed
that
the
plaintiff
was
advised
by
the
flra
that
the
grievance
procedure
was
his
available
remedy
and
declined
to
invoke
even
the
initial
step
of
the
grievance
procedure,
and
therefore--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
i
think...
i
think
that's
why
i
said
earlier
that
there
was
some
element
of
untidiness
to
our
position.
that
is,
we're
not
contending
that
this
was
precisely
the
scheme
that
congress
envisioned.
but
our...
our...
the
court's
task,
i
believe,
is
to
reconcile
congress'
apparent
intent...
attempt
to
construct
a
comprehensive
scheme
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
mean,
we
would...
we
would
resist
the
notion
that
we're
making
it
all
up.
that
is,
whenever
congress...
whenever
this
court
attempts
to
harmonize
two
distinct
statutes
to
make
them...
in
order
that
they
would
make
sense
taken
together,
the
result
is
likely
to
be
that
neither
statute
will
be
read
in
precisely--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
is
a...
a
second
statute,
and
it's
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
would
generally
allow
an
individual
who
is
aggrieved
by
a
federal
government
action
to
file
suit
in
court.
and
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
manifested
with
sufficient
clarity
its
intent
to
divest
the
court
of
jurisdiction
under
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
it
really
depends
upon
the
extent
to
which...
it
really
depends
on
where
the
administrative
procedures
go.
that
is,
the
apa
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
final...
it's...
it's
a
little
bit
hard
to
define.
it
would
in
some
sense
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it...
it
would
in
some
sense
be
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
drug
test
that
he's
already
been
required
to
take.
one
of
the
things
that
makes
this--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--exactly.
and
one...
one
of
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--one
of
the
things
that
makes
this
tricky
is
that
under
this
court's
decision
of
city
of
los
angeles
v.
lyons,
if
an
individual
is
subjected
to
allegedly
unconstitutional
conduct
but
has
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
happen
to
him
again
and
damages
are
unavailable,
then
the...
there
is
no
standing
to
seek
injunctive--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
right.
and
i
think
in
a
sense
what
you
could
say
is
the...
the
agency
action
that
he
would
be
complaining
about
in
the
apa
suit
is
not
so
much
the
past
drug
test,
it
would
be
the
threatened
or
ostensibly
threatened
drug
test.
and
his
basis
for
believing
that
they
were,
in
fact,
likely
to
occur
is
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
unconstitutional
drug
tests
in
the
past.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
would
certainly
think
that
if...
if
there
were
no
question
of
csra
preclusion,
if
we
were
just
looking
at
the
apa
standing
alone,
and
an
individual
said
they've
done
this
unconstitutional
thing
to
me
time
after
time,
my
supervisor
has
ransacked
my
office
time
and
again
or
fbi
agents
have
shown
up
at
my
door
every
day
and
have
insisted
on
searching,
i
think
even
if
damages
were
unavailable
for
the
prior
unlawful
actions,
at
some
point
we
would
say
the
likelihood
of
repetition
is
sufficiently
imminent
that
a
right
of
action
should
be
available
in
court.
and...
but
again,
i
think
all
of
these
are
perhaps
potential
alternative
bases
on
which
this
complaint
could
have
been
dismissed,
but
it
doesn't
alter
the
fact
that
an
adequate
basis
for
dismissal
was
the
failure
to
invoke
the
grievance
procedures
available
under
the
csra
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
i
think
it's
not
simply
a...
to
say
that
it's
simply
a
question
of
when
the
individual
can
file
suit
is
to
presuppose
that
the
grievance
procedures
won't
work.
and
there's
no
reason
to
assume
that
that
will
happen.
that
is,
congress
manifested...
congress
in
the
csra
enacted
congressional
findings
to
the
effect
that
collective
bargaining
and...
and
union
activity
in
the
public
sector
are
in
the
public
interest.
it
specifically
required
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
under
the
csra
should
contain
grievance
procedures
for
the
resolution
of
disputes,
and
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
constitutional
claim
could
go
to
court,
and
what...
what
we've
sketched
out
in
the
brief
is
two
alternative
routes
for
judicial
review
in
the
event
that
the
grievance
was
processed
to
its
conclusion,
that
is,
a
finding
by
the
flra.
on
the
one
hand,
it
would
be
possible
to
invoke
the
provision
of
the
csra
that
specifically
refers
to
judicial
review
of
flra
decisions
generally,
and
that
provides
for
review
either
in
the
regional
courts
of
appeals
or
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
however,
it...
there
is
a
difficulty
with
the
statutory
language
in
the
sense
that
that
provision
that
authorizes
court
of
appeals
review
specifically
excludes
flra
decisions
on
grievances.
and
therefore,
if
the
court
felt
like
that
sort
of
tweaking
of
the
statutory
language
was
just
too
much
to
tolerate,
then
the
available
remedy
would
be
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
doesn't
say
you
have
no
judicial
review.
it...
the...
the
provision
that
would
otherwise
authorize
judicial
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals
of
flra
actions
is
made
inapplicable
to
grievance
procedures.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
exactly,
but
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
the
statute...
the
csra
does
not
say...
does
not
purport
to
divest
the
courts
of
the
authority
that
they
would
otherwise
have
under
different
statutes
to
adjudicate
challenges
to
employment
decisions.
now--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
the
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that...
that
would
be
a
possible
tweak.
i'm
not
sure
if
it
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that
would
be
a
basis
for
dismissal
in
this
case.
i
was
going
to
say
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
would
solve
the
problem
from
petitioner's
standpoint
because--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
would...
the...
the
remedy
for
a...
an
alleged
prohibited
personnel
practice...
and,
i
think,
an
unconstitutional
personnel
action
would
be
a
prohibited
personnel
practice
under
the
statute.
the
remedy
for
that
is
to
complain
to
the
office
of
special
counsel.
now,
if
the
office
of
special
counsel
seeks
corrective
action
with
the
merit
systems
protection
board
and
the
mspb
issues
a
decision
unfavorable
to
the
employee,
then
the
employee,
under
the
terms
of
the
csra
itself,
can
seek
judicial
review
of
the
mspb's
decision
in
the
federal
circuit.
so
there
would
be
a
potential
route--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
if...
again,
if
the
osc
asked
for
a
corrective
action
in
the
mspb.
now,
if
the
osc
processes
the
complaint
and
concludes
either
that
the
factual
allegations
are
unsubstantiated
or
that
the
allegations,
even
if
true,
wouldn't
constitute
a
prohibited
personnel
practice
and
terminates
the
investigation
on
that
basis,
there's
no
avenue
for
judicial
review
under
the
terms
of
the
csra
of
the...
the
osc's
decision
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
so
i
think
that
the...
the
route
you've
sketched
out
might,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
lead
to
judicial
review
without
any
tweaking
of
the
statute.
but
if
the
osc
dismissed
the
complaint,
we
would
still
be
left
with
the
problem
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
and
that...
that's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that...
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that...
that
is
the
position
that
they've
taken
in
the
brief.
the
position
of
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
position
of
the
osc
and
the
department
of
justice
is
that
osc's
jurisdiction
over
faa
employees
is
not
limited
to
whistleblower
complaints.
now...
now,
it's
clear
that
in
the
run
of
complaints,
with
respect
to
employees
of
other
federal
agencies,
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
between
the
parties
that
osc's
jurisdiction
would
extend
beyond
whistleblower
complaints.
the...
the
only
point
of
dispute
is
with
respect
to
the
faa.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
it's
not.
and
indeed,
in
footnote
28
of
this
court's
decision
in
bush
v.
lucas,
the
court
specifically
identified
warrantless
searches
as
an
example
of
conduct
in
which
an
employer
might
engage
towards
its
employees
that
would
not
constitute
a
personnel
action.
and
we
think
that's
good
authority
for
the
proposition
that
an
allegedly
unconstitutional
drug
test
is
not
a
personnel
action.
now,
if
the
employee
had
refused
to
take
the
test
and
been
dismissed
or
disciplined,
that
would
be
a
personnel
action.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
not...
no,
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
obviously,
in...
in
other
circuits,
we
prevailed
on
the...
the
theory
that
the
csra
precludes
review
even
of
constitutional
claims.
and
again,
if
i
could
return
just
for
a
moment
to
the...
the
point
i
was
making
earlier
about
the
grievance
procedure.
congress
has
clearly
manifested
a
preference
for
the
inclusion
of
grievance
procedures
in
collective
bargaining
agreements,
and...
and
given
that
express
congressional
preference,
it
doesn't
seem
right
for
this
court
to
assume
that
the
grievance
procedures
won't
work.
and
this
seems
to
be
an
ideal
example
of
a
case
that
potentially
implicates
constitutional
issues
but
that
still
falls
squarely
within
the
expertise
of
the
union,
the
arbitrator,
and
the
flra.
that
is,
the
dispute
here
concerns
whether,
in
fact,
petitioner
was
tested
more
frequently
than
his
colleagues,
and
if
so,
what
was
the
explanation?
was
it
simply
random
deviations?
was
it
potentially
a...
a
glitch
in
the
computer
program
that
was
used
to
generate
a
random
list
of
names,
or
was
there
some
invidious
motivation
as...
as
petitioner
has
suggested?
the
resolution
of
those
types
of
questions
falls
entirely
within
the
expertise
of
the
participants
in
the
grievance
process
even
though
constitutional
law
per
se
is
not
what
labor
arbitrators
are
best
at.
and
so,
i
guess
to...
to
return
for
a
second
to...
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
why
shouldn't
the
csra
be
read
to
preclude
judicial
review
of
constitutional
claims
altogether.
i
mean,
we
certainly
think
that
if...
in
a
sense,
that's...
that's
a
debate
we
would
be
happy
to
lose.
that
is,
the
government
has
not
suggested
that
we
have
an
affirmative
interest
in
preserving
judicial
review
of
those
claims,
and
if
the
court
were
looking
for
a...
the
simplest
solution
to
the
problem,
that
solution
would
be...
have
just
as
much
to
recommend
it
as
petitioner's
solution,
which
is
that
you
go
straight
into
federal
district
court.
however,
we
don't
think
that
congress
has
spoken
with
the
degree
of
clarity
that
this
court's
decisions
demand
to
preclude
all
judicial
review
of
constitutional
challenges,
and
we
think
the
best
way
of
reconciling
that
presumption
of
judicial
review
with
the
comprehensive
nature
of
the
csra
scheme
is
to
provide
that
claims...
constitutional
claims
are
reviewable
if,
and
only
if,
the
plaintiff
has
made
all
reasonable
efforts
to
utilize
the
available
administrative
remedies.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
