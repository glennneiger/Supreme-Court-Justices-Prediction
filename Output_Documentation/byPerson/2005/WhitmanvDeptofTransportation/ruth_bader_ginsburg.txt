justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
position,
ms.
karlan,
was
that
he
doesn't
even
have
to
ask
the
union.
justice
breyer
is
presenting
a
scenario
where
he
asks
the
union
and
the
union
says
we've
got
better
things
to
do
with
our
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
your
position
is
he
doesn't
have
to
ask
at
all.
he
can
go
directly
into
federal
court
under
1331.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
because
my...
when
i
first
looked
at
this,
i
thought,
well,
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
have
been...
should
have
been
resolved
at
the
grievance
level,
shouldn't
have
even
have
to
get
to
arbitration
if
he's
right.
he
wants
a
survey
to
see
if
he's
being
picked
on.
if
he
is,
there
would
be
redress.
so
it
seemed
like
this
was
the
kind
of
complaint
that
was
best
handled
in
that
kind
of
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
difference...
what's
separating
you
and
whitman,
it
seems,
is
a
question
of
timing.
the
action
that
you're
describing
that
would
come
at
the
end,
after
he's
used
the
administrative
process,
is
the
same
one
that
he
is
seeking
to
bring
at
the
front
end.
that
is,
it's
a
1331
action--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and...
and
it's
based
on
the
government's
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
nonmonetary
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
position
on
the
statute
was
that
it
doesn't
afford
a
right
of
action,
that
it
was
just
an
instruction
to
the
secretary.
maybe
i
misread
your
position
on
the
statute.
we're
talking
about
45-1048?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
government's
position
was
there's
no
right
of
action
under
that
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
on
the
view
that
it
was
an
exclusive
remedy.
the...
the
statute
is
not
written
in...
in
any
way
as
an
exhaustion
requirement.
it
says
you've
got
a
minor
grievance...
issue.
you
go
through
the
grievance
procedure.
there
is
no
judicial
review
at
the
end
of
the
line.
so
you
would
be
converting
something
that
congress
wrote
to
be
an
exclusive
remedy
into
an
exhaustion
requirement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but...
but
here,
that's
not
this
case
because
he
said,
when
i
complained,
they
did
it
again.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
that
the
statute
as
written
says
you
don't
have
any
judicial
review
for
these
kinds
of
actions?
you
go
through
the
grievance
procedure,
win
or
lose.
that's
it.
there
is
no
judicial
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
judicial
review--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
it
does
in
the
case
of
major
actions.
