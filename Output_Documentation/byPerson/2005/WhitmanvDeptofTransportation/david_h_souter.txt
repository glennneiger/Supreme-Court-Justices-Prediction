h.
souter
well,
why...
why
can't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
simply
means
that
the
grievance
procedure
is
more
valuable
in
this
case
than
merely
talking
to
his
supervisor.
and...
and
the...
the
issue...
maybe...
maybe
we're
missing
it,
but
the
issue
is
why
isn't
there
a
very
good
reason
to
require
him
to
go
through
the
grievance
procedure,
number
one,
to...
to
cut
down
on
needless
federal
court
actions
and,
number
two,
under
the...
sort
of
the
general
policy
of
favoring
what
collective
bargaining
agreements
negotiate.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but...
no...
no
question.
that
would
be
an
easier
case.
but
why
shouldn't
we
require
an
exhaustion
for
those
two
reasons
and
maybe
others?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
may
not
have
any
right
to
it,
but
in
fact,
he
may
get
some
relief.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
union
may
say,
okay,
we're
going
to
take
this
one
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the...
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
whole
right
to...
to
go
into
court
with
a
constitutional
claim
is
absent
from
the
statute.
and...
and
so
we
may
as
well
get
hung
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb.
if...
if
we're
going
to
recognize
the
one,
i
don't
see
that
we're
going
too
much
further
in...
in
saying
it's
got
to
be
conditional
on
the
other.
