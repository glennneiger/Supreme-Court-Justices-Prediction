well,
ms.
karlan,
let
me
put
one
other
element
in
here.
was...
was
your
client
specifically
told
by
the
flra
to
bring
a
grievance
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
that
is
if...
if
the
union
doesn't
agree
to
arbitration?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
as
to
that,
if...
if
there
were
a
petitioner
with
some
constitutional
claim...
let's
not
get
into
the
debate
about
significant
or
non
significant...
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
you
say
the
petitioner
can't
go
to
court
with
the
constitutional
claim
unless
he
first
persuades
the
union
to
seek
arbitration.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
now,
did
you
raise
the
exhaustion
claim?
did
the
government
raise
it
in
the
lower
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is...
is...
should
it
be
a
little
bit
of
a
concern
to
us
that
the
lower
court
didn't
address
it?
should
it
be
sent
back
to
look
at
this
exhaustion
notion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you...
you
have
picked
one
way
to
do
that.
you
say
go
through
the
grievance
procedure.
if
there's
a
constitutional
question
remaining,
if
you
haven't
been
satisfied,
then
you
bring
the
action
in
court.
another
way
to
say
is,
well,
as
long
as
we're
making
this
up,
why
not
allow
the...
the
action
to
proceed
at
once
in
court,
but
then
the
court
to
say,
i'm
going
to
abstain
while
you
go
through
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
dispute
were
to
go
to
arbitration...
there
are
very
limited
provisions
for
judicial
review
in
the
event
there
is
a
decision...
could
the
constitutional
claim
still
go
to
court?
