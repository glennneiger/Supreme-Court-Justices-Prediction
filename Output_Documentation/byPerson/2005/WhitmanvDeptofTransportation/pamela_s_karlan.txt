ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
government
now
concedes
that
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
holding
that
the
negotiated
grievance
procedure
of
the
civil
service
reform
act
strips
federal
courts
of
their
jurisdiction
to
hear
constitutional
claims
by
federal
employees.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
that's
correct,
but
the
government
correctly
conceded
perhaps
i
should
have
said.
so
i
think
that
the--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--so
the
question
before
the
court
is
not
whether,
i
think,
mr.
whitman
can
receive
constitutional
judicial
review,
but
rather,
where
and
how
he
is
supposed
to
do
so.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
of
course,
you
can.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
i...
i
think,
obviously,
the
court
has
an
obligation
to
satisfy
itself
of
the
jurisdiction.
but
i'll
point
out
then
that
you
would
have
had
that
obligation
as
well
in
nteu
against
von
raab
in
which
this
court
addressed
precisely
the
same
kind
of
case,
litigated
in
precisely
the
same
posture.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it
was
raised
in
the
district
court
and
the
government
chose
not
to
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
here.
but,
of
course,
you
have,
as
justice
scalia
said,
an
independent
obligation
to
satisfy
yourself
of
your
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
i'm
not
saying
that
you
decided
it
in
nteu
against
von
raab,
justice
scalia.
i'm
just
saying
that
given
that
you
were
apparently
satisfied
with
the
theory,
you
should
be
satisfied
here
too
as
well.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
with
all
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
incorrect.
the
civil
service
reform
act
provides
for
judicial
review
of
personnel
actions,
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
opinion
for
the
court
that
you
wrote
in
fausto,
you'll
see
that
you
repeatedly
referred
to
them
as
personnel
actions
there.
now,
a
warrantless
search
of
a
government
employee,
as
this
court's
opinion
in
bush
against
lucas
says
at
note
28,
is
not
a
personnel
action,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
way
of
obtaining
review
of
it
through
the
civil
service
reform
act.
but
it
is
not
in
any
sense
here
a
minor
violation
of
mr.
whitman's
rights.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
justice
scalia,
but
he
would
have
to
bet
the
ranch
to
do
it.
and
i
think--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
incorrect
when
it
comes
to
government
agency
actions
of
this
kind.
that's
what
the
abbott
laboratories
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
makes
quite
clear.
and
i
think
last
week,
just
last
week,
this
court
understood
precisely
that
problem
in
talking
about
the
doctor
who
faces
the
abortion
statute
in
ayotte.
and
several
members
of
the
court
pointed
out
that
to
risk
your
license
there
or
to
risk,
in
this
case,
a
job
that
our
client
has
held
for
20
years
in
order
to
challenge
whether
his
fourth
amendment
rights
are
violated
is
not
normally
how
judicial
review
should
be
accomplished.
and
so
the
question
here
really
is
how
judicial
review
should
be
accomplished,
and
we've
maintained
all
along
that
the
way
judicial
review
should
be
accomplished
here
is
the
way
that
it's
accomplished
in
all
sorts
of
cases,
by
bringing
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
seeking
injunctive
relief.
now,
what
the
government--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
can
see
why
that
might
seem
at
first
a
little
strange
to
you,
your
honor.
but
the
point
of
the
csra
is
to
deal
not
with
major
versus
minor
actions.
it's
true
that
minor
actions
you
get
administrative
review
and
not
judicial
review,
but
that's
about
personnel
actions.
mr.
whitman
is
not
challenging
a
personnel
action
here.
he's
challenging
a
warrantless
search.
the
warrantless
search
was
the
nonrandom,
arbitrary
urinalysis
and
breathalyzer
to
which
he
was
subjected.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
justice
scalia.
he
was
required,
as
a
condition
of
his
employment,
to
submit
to
constitutional
drug
testing.
and
his
allegation
in
this
case
is
that
this
drug
test
was
unconstitutional
and--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
your
honor.
it
became
unconstitutional
when
it
became
clear
that
at
the
anchorage
air
traffic
control
facility,
they
were
not
complying
with
the
requirements
both
of--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
he
alleges
in
his
complaint
that
he
was
subjected
to
13
tests,
and
then
when
he
complained--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--over
a
period
of
time
of
approximately
5
years
in
which
other
employees
were
subjected
to
no
more
than
one
or
two.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
but
he
was
picked--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
justice
stevens.
his
allegation
is
he
was
picked
seven
times
in
a
row
for
random
drug
testing.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
right,
and--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
he
may
well
not.
he
may
well
lose
on
his
constitutional
claim,
justice
breyer,
and
that's
not
the
issue
before
this
court.
the
question
is
whether
a
district
judge
should
decide,
should
listen
to
the
facts
and
decide
whether
this
was
random
or
not.
i
tried
once
to
calculate
what
are
the
chances
of--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i...
i
tried
to
do
it
and
i
couldn't
do
it.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
it
wouldn't--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
right,
but
it
would
be...
i...
i
know.
you
know,
i...
it...
my
calculator
doesn't
go
that
high.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
but
it's
high.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it's
the
undergraduates
that
know
how
to
do
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
right.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
justice
breyer.
the
problem
with
assuming
that
a
union
will
take
a
claim
like
this
to
arbitration
is
the
following.
unions
generally
do
not
take
individual
employee
grievances
to
arbitration,
especially
if
you
look
at
this
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
requires
the
union
to
pay
the
cost
if
they
lose.
now,
on
a
claim
like
this,
for
the
very
reason
that
you
suggested
earlier,
it
may
be
difficult
to
figure
out
what
the
facts
are.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
right.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
just
as,
for
example,
the
employees
did
in
the
nffe
against
weinberger
case
on
which
you
sat
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
the
government
again
there
tried
to
argue
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
the
court
really
gave
that
argument
the
back
of
its
hand
because
traditionally
the
way
that
someone
who
wants
to
allege,
someone
who
is
an
employee
or
not
who
wants
to
allege,
that
there...
that
he's
seeking
injunctive
relief
for
a
constitutional
violation,
goes
to
the
federal
district
courts
under
28
u.s.c.
1331,
not
to
a
negotiated
grievance
procedure
that
was
not
intended
and
cannot
operate
in
the
way
that
the
government
seems
to
hope--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
i
have
two
somewhat
different
answers
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg.
one,
which
i'll
turn
to
in
a
moment,
is
about
the
specifics
of
this
case,
but
i
want
to
give
the
more
general
one
first.
and
that
is,
that
the
negotiated
grievance
procedures
that
unions
set
up
are
for
the
benefit
of
employees
who
believe
that
that
is
the
best
way
of
seeking
to
resolve
their
complaints,
and
most
complaints,
quite
honestly,
will
be
done
that
way.
most
people
are
not
going
to
go
into
federal
court,
especially
not
if
all
they
can
seek
is
injunctive
relief
and
they
have
to
pay
a
filing
fee
and
it's
going
to
take
a
long
time
to
go
there.
now,
mr.
whitman
had
two
problems
that
made
it
unlikely
he
was
going
to
go
through
the
grievance
process
here.
the
first
of
these
problems
is
that
the
grievance
process,
as
it
sets...
as
it's
set
out
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
two
stages
of
which
he
has
control...
and
i
can
return
in
a
moment
to
what
happens
after
that.
but
the
two
stages
at
which
he
has
control
are
to
talk
to
his
supervisor
and
to
talk
to
the
facility
manager.
when
it
comes
to
drug
testing
of
the
kind
to
which
mr.
whitman
was
subjected
here,
his
supervisor
does
not
have
authority
over
that.
it's
done
from
outside
the
facility.
so
talking
to
his
supervisor
will
not
get
him
anywhere.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
if
his
union
had
negotiated
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
required
exhaustion,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
to
make
him
go
through
it,
but
they
didn't
do
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
if
i
could
go
through
the
grievance
process,
i
think
you'll
see
why
this
grievance
process
cannot
be
turned
into
an
exhaustion
process
without
this
court,
in
words
that
justice
ginsburg
used
last
week,
inserting
a
lot
of
carets
into
the
statute.
that
is,
there
are
two
stages
of
this
grievance
process
over
which
mr.
whitman
has
control.
he
can
go
to
his...
his
supervisor
in
an
informal
conversation.
there
will
be
no
fact
finding.
there
is
no
right
to
call
witnesses.
there
is
no
right
to
present
evidence.
if
he
doesn't
like
that...
and
he
has
only
15
days
to
do
it...
he
can
then
appeal
to
the...
to
the
supervisor
of
the
facility.
again,
he
has
no
right
to
present
evidence.
he
has
no
right
to
any
kind
of
fact
finding.
he
has
no
right
to
a
reasoned
decision.
those
are
the--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--they
may
and
i'll
turn
to
that
in
just
a
moment,
but
let
me
add
one
more
thing
to
the
answer
i
was
giving
a
moment
ago
to
justice
ginsburg,
which
is
one
of
the
problems
here
is
that
our
client
alleges
in
his
supplemental
complaint
that
when
he
first
complained
about
this,
he
was
singled
out
yet
again
for
retaliatory
testing.
and
so
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
case
in
which
someone
who
is
being
subjected
repeatedly
to
retaliatory
tests
would
be
worried.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
question
of--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--he
was...
he
wasn't
told.
he
was
advised
by
someone
who
said
the
flra
has
no
jurisdiction
here
because
this
isn't
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
of
course,
what
the
government
wants
him
to
do
is
to
exhaust
by
going
back
to
the
flra
which
has
already
told
him
that
it
has
no
expertise
on
this
matter.
so
let
me
turn
to
that
third
stage
of
the
grievance
process
now,
which
is
now
he
invokes
arbitration,
or
at
least
he
asks
his
union
to
because
under
section
7121(b)(1)(c)(iii)
of
the
statute,
only
the
union
can
invoke
arbitration.
now,
this
court
noted,
as
long
ago
as
vaca
against
sipes,
that
unions
invoke
arbitration
in
only
a
minuscule
handful
of
cases,
so
that
in
vaca
against
sipes,
it
was
1
out
of
900.
there
was
a
recent
study,
the
most
recent
study
i
could
find
that
was
published,
about
federal
government
employees
that
were
civilian
employees
of
the
army,
and
it
looked
at
how
often
did
the
31
different
unions
that
represent
civilian
employees
of
the
army
actually
invoke
arbitration
vis
a
vis
the
number
of
grievances
that
were
filed.
and
it
found
that
in
the
years
it
looked
at,
no
more
than
6
percent
got
arbitration.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
there
are
two
reasons
for
that
i
think.
one
is
he
suffers
an
irreparable
bet
the
farm
injury
every
time
he's
searched
unconstitutionally.
the
second
is
that
the
statute
simply
doesn't
say
that.
i
can
understand...
honestly,
i
can...
why
this
court
is
in
favor
of
exhaustion
requirements.
and
if
the
statute
contained
one,
it
would
be
eminently
sensible
for
you
to
apply
it.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
absolutely,
and
i
think
if
you
used
this
court's
opinion
in
madigan
against
mccarthy
as
your
template
for
thinking
about
whether
to
impose
an
exhaustion
requirement
here,
because
i
think,
quite
frankly,
that's
what
you
would
be
doing...
you
would
be
imposing
one
that
doesn't
exist
now.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
court--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter,
because
i
think
this
court
has
traditionally
allowed
individuals
who
are
bringing
constitutional
claims
for
injunctive
relief
to
seek
that
relief.
nothing
in
the
csra
changed
that,
and
if
i
can
explain
why
for
just
a
moment,
i
think
it'll
be
helpful.
if
you
look
at
this
court's
opinion
in
fausto
or
you
look
at
this
court's
opinion
in
bush
against
lucas
or
the
opinion
in
karahalios,
which
i
think
are
the
three
leading
cases
from
this
court
construing
the
civil
service
reform
act
in...
in
this
kind
of
fashion,
you'll
notice
that
they
repeatedly
referred
to
those
acts
as
being
comprehensive
with
regard
to
personnel
actions.
personnel
actions
is
not
a
casual
phrase.
it
is
a
defined
term
in
the
csra.
it's
defined
in
section
2302(a),
which
is...
was
discussed
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
5,
note
5.
and
you
will
notice
there,
if
you
read
it,
that
they
do
include...
indeed,
congress
in
1994
amended
the
statute
to
add
to
the
list
of
personnel
actions
orders
for
psychiatric
testing.
there
was
nothing
here
that
turns
a
drug
test
into
a
personnel
action.
now,
the
csra
is
absolutely
comprehensive
in
its
field,
but
its
field
is
personnel
actions.
and
this
case
is
not
a
personnel
action.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
justice
kennedy,
all
sorts
of
personnel
actions
might
be
minor
and
they
might
be
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
csra
wants
to
have
decided
administratively
only
or
through
exhaustion.
this
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
it
is
not
minor.
as
this
court
held
in
von
raab,
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
kind
of
test
constitutional--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--the
fourth
amendment
violation
here
is
this
court
said
that
warrantless,
suspicionless
drug
testing
of
federal
employees
is
acceptable
only
if
it
has
safeguards
that
ensure
that
there
is
no
discretion
exercised
in
the
field
and
that
it's
truly
random.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
your
honor.
he
alleges
that
they
are
not,
in
fact,
following
the
random
procedures,
that
instead,
when
it's
more
convenient
for
them
to
test
him...
and
i
can
understand
why
they
want
to
test
him.
every
time
they
test
him
he
passes
the
test.
so
why
not
ask
mr.
whitman
who
is
a
compliant,
sober
employee,
if
you
need
another
person
to
just
round
out
the
numbers
to--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no.
the
operation
of
the
system,
as
it
applies
to
mr.
whitman
in
anchorage.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
and
then
by
retaliating--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--of
course,
it
is
because
you
can't
conduct
a
random--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no.
and
if
the
government...
the
government
in
its
answer
in
the
district
court
does
not
say
there
was
a
computer
malfunction.
they
say
we
don't
really
even
keep
records
back
as
long
as
he--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well...
well,
yes.
of
course,
he
was
proceeding
pro
se
in
the
district
court.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
he...
he
did.
he
said
it
is
not
random,
and
then
in
his
supplemental
complaint,
he
alleged
that
he
was
retaliated
against
for
complaining
the
first
time
around
and
was
selected
out
when
he
wasn't
on
the
list
to
be
tested
yet
again.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
two
answers
to
that.
one
is
the
fact
that
congress...
in
1978
they
first
gave
the
entire
list
of
personnel
actions.
in
1994,
they
amended
that
list
to
add
psychiatric
testing.
this
is
after
the
government
has
already
been
engaged
in
urine
testing
of
federal
employees.
if
they
wanted
to
say
drug
testing,
they
would
have
said
it.
and
for
you
to
add
that
is
really--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--with
all
respect--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
you
would
have
to
overrule
the
fort
stewart
school
against
flra
case
that
the
court
decided
in
1990
to
define
working
conditions
to
include
a
drug
test
because
there...
and
it's
cited
at
page
28
of
the
nteu's
brief...
the
court
says
that
the
term,
working
conditions,
refers
to,
quote,
circumstances
or
states
of
affairs
attendant
to
one's
performance
of
a
job.
now,
drug
testing
is
not
attendant
to
his
performance
of
his
job.
it
is
the
condition
of
his
holding
the
job
in
some
sense
that
he
pass
the
test.
and
if
he
failed
that
test,
he
would,
indeed,
have
to
go
through
the
csra.
but
because
he
passed
the
test,
he
has
no
way
of
getting
into
court.
now,
if
i
could
turn--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that's--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--but
if
the...
but
if
congress,
justice
scalia,
had
thought
that
that
catchall
phrase
covered
psychiatric
tests,
it
would
not
have
amended
the
statute
in
1994
to
add
them
specifically.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
yes,
and
it's
good
for
the
faa
to
comply
with
the
constitution.
and
that's
why
we
think
he
should
be
allowed
to
go
to
federal
court.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
a
difference
with
respect
to
exhaustion
on
those
two
claims.
the
government
simply
says
he
can
never
get
review
of
the
statutory
claim.
so
i
don't
think
anyone
here
is
arguing
that
there
should
be
a
differential
treatment
with
respect
to
exhaustion.
it's
with
respect
to
whether
you
can
get
into
court--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--oh,
no.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
we
spend
rather
a
bit
of
time
in
our
brief
explaining--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--what
can
i...
what
can
i
say?
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
answer
to
that
would
be
yes.
he
might
end
up
being
precluded,
if
he
lost
in
federal
court
on
the
constitutional
claim,
from
coming
back
on
the
statutory
claim.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
there
is
exhaustion
required
with
respect
to
either
set
of
claims.
if
i
may,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i...
i
think
it's
clear
at
this
point
that
the
government
really
is
asking
this
court
to
rewrite
the
csra
on
the
fly.
as
late
as
page
48
of
their
brief
on
the
merits,
they
wouldn't
tell
us
whether
our
client
should
go
to
federal
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals.
then
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
they
say,
well,
you
could
rewrite
2302(a)(2)(a)(xi)
and
(x).
and
i
think
the
csra
is
a
sufficiently
detailed
and
comprehensive
statute
that
this
court
has
resisted
rewriting
several
times.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it
is.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that
the
system
of
collective
bargaining
negotiated
grievance
processes
here
is
set
up
in
a
way
that
does
not
filter
it
into
judicial
review.
and
therefore...
in
1994,
when
congress
amended
section--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
no.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
your
honor.
we
think
that
that
goes
straight
under
the
apa.
now,
here's
the
real
problem
with
the
government--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
know.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
argument
against
it--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--the
argument
against
it
in
this
case,
which
stems,
from
among
other
things,
this
court's
decision
in
zipes
against
twa
and
in
heckler
against
day,
is
the
government
waived
any
claim
that
our
client
should
have
been
required
to
exhaust.
they
never
raised
that
issue
below,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
a
failure
to
raise
a
nonexhaustion
defense
is
waiver
of
that
defense.
you
should
wait
until
you
have
a
case
where
there
has
been
briefing
and
fact
finding.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
and
that
is
that
when
congress
amended
7121(a)
in
1994,
they
amended
it
to
make
clear
that
it
had
no
effect
on
judicial
causes
of
action
that
arose
from
elsewhere.
that's
what
the
insertion
of
the
word
administrative
there
was
done.
it
was
not
done
in
order
to
create
an
exhaustion
regime,
but
rather,
to
eliminate
a
preclusion
regime.
and
we
set
this
out
quite
carefully
in
our
brief,
as
do
the
two
union
amici,
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
grievance
procedure
is
here.
it
is
not
to
create
an
exhaustion
regime
and
certainly
not
to
create
an
exhaustion
regime
with
what
the
government,
at
least,
concedes
under
the
statute,
as
now
written,
is
not
a
personnel
action.
that
is,
the
csra
is
quite
comprehensive
with
regard
to
personnel
actions,
but
it
leaves
to
traditional
sources
of
judicial
enforcement
things
that
are
not
personnel
actions.
and
as
this
court's
opinion
in
bush
against
lucas
makes
absolutely
clear,
a
warrantless
search
of
the
kind
to
which
our
client
was
subjected
is
not
a
personnel
action
and,
therefore,
is
not
within
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
the
csra
for
dealing
with
personnel
actions.
thank
you.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
absolutely.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
we--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--oh,
oh.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
thank
you,
both.
