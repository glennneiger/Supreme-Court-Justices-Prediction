chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
whitman
v.
department
of
transportation.
ms.
karlan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
if...
if...
do
you
concede
that
if
he
had,
for
example,
refused
the
testing
and
been
fired
and
it
was
a
major
personnel
action,
he
would
have
to
go
through
the
statutory
procedures
before
bringing
that...
the
constitutional
claim
on
review
of
those
administrative
procedures?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
it
seem
odd...
and
this
is
sort
of
the
logic
of...
in
fausto
and
some
of
the
other
cases...
that
when
you
have
a
major
action,
you
have
to
exhaust
before
you
can
go
into
court,
but
if
you
have
something
that
doesn't
qualify
as
a
major
adverse
action,
you
get
to
go
to
court
right
away?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms....
ms.
karlan,
you
have
a...
a
statutory
claim
that
essentially
mirrors
the
constitutional
claim.
the
statute
requires
the
testing
to
be
random
and
impartial.
if
we
think
there's
a
difference
between
the
constitutional
claims
and
statutory
claims
with
respect
to
their
treatment
under
the
csra,
how
do
you
handle
that?
does
he
have
to
exhaust
the
statutory
claim
but
not
the
constitutional
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
still
don't
understand
how
they
proceed.
does
he
have
to
bring...
can
he
go
right
into
court
on
the
constitutional
claim
even
if
the
statutory
claim
has
to
go
through
the
grievance
procedure?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
identical
claims
have
to
proceed
under
two
different
routes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
would
mean
you
don't
get
into
court
at
all
then.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
in
the...
even
if
it's
not
a
major
personnel
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
ms.
karlan,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
get
to
say
that.
your
time
is
up.
[laughter]
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
also
this
morning,
we
decide
two
argued
cases
in
per
curiam
opinions.
in
04-1131,
whitman
versus
department
of
transportation,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit
is
vacated,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
in
05-465,
mohawk
industries
versus
williams,
the
writ
of
certiorari
we
previously
granted
limited
to
question
1
presented
by
the
petition
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted;
however,
today,
we
now
grant
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
judgment
is
vacated,
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
11th
circuit
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
our
decision
just
announced
in
anza
versus
ideal
steel
supply
corporation.
