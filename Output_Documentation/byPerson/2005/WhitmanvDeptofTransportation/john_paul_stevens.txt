paul

do
you
think
it
becomes
unconstitutional
when...
when
you
have
one
more
test?
when
did
it
become
unconstitutional?
the
first
test
was
not
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
tests
did
he
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
over
what
period
of
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
maybe
three...
three
a
year?
is
that
what
it
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
to
interrupt
you.
what
is
the
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand,
the
allegations
are
that
there
was
random
procedure
in
effect,
and
he
thinks
maybe
he's
been
tested
more
frequently
than
some
other
people.
that's
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the...
the
system
as
a
whole
is
not
challenged
as
violating
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
having
him
take
more
tests
than
would
be
produced
by
a
purely
random
selection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
we
ever
said
that's
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
computer
malfunctions,
that's
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
relief
that
he
requested
was
to
do
a
little
more
testing
to
see
whether
he
was
being
tested
more
than
the
average
person,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
not...
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
alleging
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stewart,
can
i
just
ask
one
question?
because
i
didn't
quite
follow
it.
i
thought
you
were
describing
a
major
personnel
action
in...
in
your
description
of
the
administrative
review.
but
if
this
is
a
minor
or
whatever,
a
lesser
review,
would
there
have
been
an
avenue
through
the
administrative
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
through
the
collective
bargaining--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
then
supposing
the
union
is
unwilling
to
grieve
or
take
it
up
or
he
fails,
then
what
happens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
would
be
in
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stewart,
if
you
assume
the
apa
is
the
remedy...
we're
talking
about
a
district
court
procedure...
how
would
you
describe
the
final
agency
action
that
would
be
challenged
in
that
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
assume
that
the...
he
seeks
a
grievance,
and
the
union
refuses
to
grieve.
and
then
he
then
goes
into...
into
district
court
under
the
apa.
what
would
the
final
agency
action
be
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
very
hard
to
define.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
would
his
relief
be?
he
can't
untake
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he
can't
damages
under
the
apa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
a
final
agency
action.
the
threat
of
another
test
isn't
a
final
agency
action,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stewart,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
in
the
government's
view,
is
it
a
personnel
action
or
is
it
not?
