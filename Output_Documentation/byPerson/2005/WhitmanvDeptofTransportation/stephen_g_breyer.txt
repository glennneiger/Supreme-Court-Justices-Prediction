justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
somebody
will
be
if
it's
random.
if
you
have
thousands
of
people,
somebody
will
be
if
it
is
random.
if
there
were
nobody
who
was
picked
seven
times,
that
would
show
it
wasn't
random.
so,
you
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--whether
he
has
a
good
constitutional
claim
here
i
guess
is
rather
doubtful,
and
maybe
it
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
are
they?
how
many
people
are
there?
how
many
people
are
tested
if
you
try
to
calculate
it?
how
many--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
federal
government?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
you
do
is
you
get
a
bell
curve
and
you
ask
the
library
of
congress
and
they'll
do
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
it's...
it's
not
hard
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
not
hard
to
do.
you
just
ask
someone
at
stanford.
they'll
do
it
for
you.
[laughter]
but
the...
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
regardless,
this
is
beside
the
point.
i...
all
right.
can
i...
i
just
want
you
at
some
point
to
get
to
not
just
the
constitutional
question.
maybe
he
can
go
in
and
raise
his
claim.
i
don't
know
if
he
should
have
exhausted
or
not,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
find
it
hard,
in
reading
this,
to
believe
the
following.
like
any
other
worker,
i
mean,
normally
you
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
the
union
takes
up
your
minor
things.
and
here,
what
you're
saying
is
although
if
it's
a
major
thing,
like
a
personnel
action,
there's
a
special
thing
where
you
get
in...
you
know,
you...
you
get
into
court
way
down
the
road.
it's
very
complicated.
this
individual,
even
though
he
classifies
it
as
a
grievance
where
the
union
is
supposed
to
take
it
up
and
the
union
tells
him
we're
not
going
to
take
it
up,
we
don't
believe
in
your
claim,
that
then
he
can
run
in
to
a
federal
judge.
now,
that...
that
i
find
surprising,
and
i'd
like
you
to
explain
how
in
your
theory
that
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
isn't
the
thing
to
do
here...
i...
i
see
that
you
are
raising
a
significant
question
in
respect
to...
at
least
in
my
view,
in
respect
to
the...
an
action
that
violates
a
regulation
that
violates
a
statute.
leave
the
constitution
aside,
but
it
might
violate
a
number
of
practices,
good
practices,
et
cetera.
but
why
isn't
focusing
on
that
the
thing
for
the
plaintiff
here
to
do
if
he
goes
to
the
union...
i'm
just
reading
from
page
6
and
7
of
your
brief...
and
he
says,
i
would
like
you
to
invoke
arbitration?
and
they
might
do
it.
now,
if
they
do
it
and
it
comes
out
in
a
way
they
don't
like,
he
then...
they
might
file
exceptions
and
they
might
win.
but
what
you're
worried
about
is
if
they
don't
win
or
if
they
don't
do
it,
they
can
go
to
court
only
if
it
involved
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
a
major
adverse
personnel
action.
that's
what's
worrying
you,
i
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
isn't
it,
at
that
stage
if
he
doesn't
get
into
court,
you
then
say
that
that
isn't
true?
they
should
be
able
to
come
to
court
in
other
instances
as
well,
making
the
same
kinds
of
arguments
that
you're
making
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you...
you...
i...
i
believe
that
there
are
millions
of
instances,
perhaps.
now,
i'm...
when
i
think
something
like
this,
i'm
quite
often
wrong.
but
i
thought
that
the
reason
that
exhaustion
is
required
is
not
always
because
statutes
require
it.
it's
partly
because
of
the
word
final
in
the
apa,
which
applies
here
as
well,
and
it's
also
because
of
the
common
law
of
administrative
law
that
requires
people
to
exhaust
their
remedies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
i
guess
you're
saying,
as
to
the
constitutional
claim,
it's
obvious
they
have
to
exhaust.
there's
no
reason
why
they
don't
have
to
exhaust
in
respect
to
the
12th
test,
which
has
already
occurred,
and
in
respect
to
the
15th,
which
might
be
threatened,
if
it
does
come
about
that
it's
threatened,
they
can
go
in,
i
guess,
under
705
of
the
apa
and
ask
for
an
injunction.
any
reason
they
couldn't
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
what
they
do
is
they
follow,
like
any
other
agency
action.
an
agency
action
has
taken
place.
i
think
it's
unconstitutional
or
you
do.
we
exhaust
our
remedies
and
then
get
to
court
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
make
our
claim.
an
agency
action
is
threatened.
i
am
threatened
with
irreparable
injury.
i
can
go
to
court,
i
think,
at
the
time
it's
threatened,
and
say
i
want
a
protective
order.
i
think
705
provides
for
that
specifically.
and...
and,
therefore,
i'm
protected.
i
can't
imagine
why
they
couldn't
do
that
if
they
have
a...
not
just
a
plausible,
but
a...
a
good
claim
that
it
does
violate
the
constitution
and
they
need
the
protection.
is
there
any
reason
they
couldn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
wouldn't.
their
point
is
that
the
very...
availing
myself
of
the
administrative
remedy
will
work
irreparable
harm
of...
in
violation
of
my
constitutional
right.
now,
maybe
that's
not
true,
but
let's
imagine
it's
true.
then
couldn't
they
go
in
and
ask
for
a
protective
order?
i
thought
that
you
could
do
that,
but
i
might
be
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
is
there
any
reason
that
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
that
here?
because
they
are
going
to
say
that...
i
don't
know
they
ever
can
make
it
out
in
this
case,
but
they
are
going
to
say
that
my
having
to
go
ahead
with
the
number...
test
number
15,
which,
by
the
way,
may
never
be
threatened,
but
if
it
is,
it
will,
the
very
fact
that
i
have
to
do
it,
violate
an
important
constitutional
right
that
i
need
to
have
protected
before
undergoing
the
text...
the
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
they
could
not
do
that
under
705.
so
there
is
a
difference
between
you
on
that.
as
to
the
statutory
claim,
i
mean,
i
find...
but
others
may
disagree
with
this.
it's
my
personal
view
that
the
notion
of
private
right
of
action
in
this
area
simply
mixes
things
up.
it's
apples
and
oranges.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything.
that
if
a
person,
in
fact,
is
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
by
a
government
action,
he
usually,
almost
always,
indeed,
can
get
judicial
review
eventually.
but
what
you're
saying
there
i
take
it
is
that
may
be
so,
but
this
impliedly
says
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
my
question
is
do
we
have
to
decide
that.
because,
after
all,
this
individual
may
get
relief
through
the
statutory
procedures
that
you
admit
are
provided
by
asking
for
grievance
arbitration.
he
may,
the
first
time
he
asks
for
it,
be
given
a
piece
of
paper
that
shows
him
he
wasn't
hurt.
or
he
may
have
been
hurt,
and
they'll
say
we
don't
it
again.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
can
happen.
do
we
have
to
decide
the
issue
today
of
whether
if
he
goes
to
the
union,
the
union
says
we
won't
arbitrate,
or
they
say
we
will
and
they
lose
and
it
isn't
as
an
unfair
labor
practice...
do
we
have
to
decide
that
issue
as
to
whether
a
person
in
those
circumstances
can
then
subsequently
go
into
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
have
to
say
the
easier
matter
is
it's
clear
that
as
to
such
matters,
you
must
exhaust.
it's
so
clear
that
there
is
no
reason
for
us
to
decide
whether
there
is
an
implied
repeal
of
the
right
at
the
end
of
some
days
to...
to
judicial
review,
a
matter
which
is
disfavored
in
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
my...
so
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
their
brief
says
is
that
they
can
go
on
a
personnel,
as
opposed
to
major
personnel,
to
the
osc
if,
and
only
if,
the
complaint
has
to
do
with
whistleblowing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
this
doesn't
have
to
do
with
whistleblowing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore,
even
if
this
were
a
personnel
action,
that
route
to
the
osc
is
not
open
to
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
not
rewriting.
i
mean...
i
mean,
it's
perhaps.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you
think...
fine.
the...
the...
but
the...
the
issue
it
seems
that
could
be
dispositive
of
this,
in
respect
to
the
nonconstitutional
claims...
and
this
is
why
i
want
to
get
your
response...
is
simply
that
it
is
a
fair
implication
from
congress
having
set
up
on
nonconstitutional
matters
a
system
of
arbitration
to
require
your
client
to
go
through
that
system
before
seeking
to
get
review
of
the
nonconstitutional
matters
in
a
federal
district
court.
now,
that's
the
normal
rule
in
administrative
law.
what
is
the
argument
that
it
wouldn't
apply
in
your
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
you
want
us
to
hold
you
don't
have
judicial
review--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--under
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
the
answer...
please,
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
off
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
hear
your
answer
to
the
question
that
if
i
agree
with
you
that
on
nonconstitutional
matters,
if
this
system
doesn't
work
for
your
client,
he
gets
review
in
a
federal
district
court.
suppose
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
what
is
the
argument
against
requiring
him
to
exhaust
the
remedy
that
is
there,
namely
a
request
for
arbitration--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
an
implication
from
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
is
there
any
other
claim...
any
other
answer
to
the
argument
other
than
they
waived
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
i...
could
you
give...
give
the
same
answer--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
respect
to
your
constitutional
claim?
why,
given
the
presence
of
section
705
of
the
act--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--one's...
forget
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
time
is
up.
that's--
