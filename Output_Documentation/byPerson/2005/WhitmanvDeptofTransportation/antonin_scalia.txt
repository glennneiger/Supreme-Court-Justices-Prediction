we're
not
bound
by
that
concession.
if
that's
a
jurisdictional
question,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
government
conceded
it
or
not,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
still
think
it's
whether
because
i
don't
agree
with
the
government.
can
i
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
is
the
question.
i
mean,
the
question
is
open
whether
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
our
cases
say
that
where
we
don't
speak
to
a
jurisdictional
question,
it
is
not
regarded
as
having
been
decided.
justice
antonin
scalia
even...
even
if
you
assume
that
von
raab
decided
it,
you
have
a
quite
different
situation
here.
the
issue
isn't
whether
there
will
be
any
judicial
review.
the
issue
is
whether
there
will
be
judicial
review
for
the
minor
grievances,
even
if
they
happen
to
involve
a
constitutional
issue,
that
are...
that
are
not...
for
which
judicial
review
was
not
provided.
any
major
employee
action...
judicial
review,
as
i
understand
it,
is
available,
and
it
is
only
relatively
insignificant
actions
for
which
judicial
review
is
not
available.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could
have
refused...
he
could
have
refused
the
search,
in
which
case
if
there
was
any
significant
personnel
action
taken
against
him
for
refusing
it,
he
would
have
had
judicial
review
of
whether
the
search
was
constitutional
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
often
the
case
where...
where,
in...
in
order
to
challenge
a
governmental
action,
you...
you
have
to
be
willing
to...
to
go
to
court
by
resisting
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
search
was
a
consequence
of
his
employment.
it...
this
wasn't
a
search
of
a...
of
a
citizen
who
had
no
connection
with
the
government.
it
was
a
search
that
he
was
required
to
submit
to
as
an
employee.
so
to...
to
describe
it
as
unrelated
to
employee
actions
seems
to
me
unrealistic.
the
only
reason
he
submitted
to
it
was
that
if
he
didn't,
he
would
have...
he
would
have
been
subject
to
an
employee
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms....
ms.
karlan,
if
this
is
indeed
serious,
are
you
sure
that
it's
not
a
personnel
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
residual
category
in
the
definition
of
personnel
action
which
says,
any
other
significant
change
in
duties,
responsibilities,
or
working
conditions.
that's
the
residual
category.
but
one
of
the
specifically
named
categories,
before
you
get
to
that,
is
a
decision
to
order
psychiatric
testing.
now,
if
that
kind
of
a
decision
could
be
a
personnel
action,
why
couldn't
a
decision
to
conduct...
to
conduct
a
drug
test
be
considered
a
personnel
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
adding
it.
there's
a
residual
category
at
the
end
or
any
other
significant
change
in
duties,
responsibilities,
or
working
conditions.
i
consider
this...
you
consider
it
a
significant
change
in
working
conditions.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
thought
he
didn't
have
to
undergo
drug
testing,
and
what
do
you
know?
he's
being
picked
on
for
drug
testing
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
then
would
a
decision
to
order
psychiatric
testing
qualify?
because
it
says,
or
any
other.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
significant
change
in
duties,
responsibilities,
or
working
conditions.
the
implication
is
that
a
decision
to
order
psychiatric
testing
is
a
significant
change
in
duties,
responsibilities,
or...
or
working
conditions.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
always
good
to
be
safe.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you...
you
agree
with
the
government
on
that,
that
he
can
never
get
review
of
the
statutory
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't...
don't
appeal
to
them
on
a...
on
a
point
on
which
you
don't
agree
with
them.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
you
know,
you
have
here
a
statute
in
which
congress,
with
malice
aforethought,
very
clearly
provides
for
judicial
review
of
any
major
personnel
actions
and
does
not
provide
for
judicial
review
of
what
it
had
regarded
as
insignificant
personnel
actions.
i
can
understand
the
position,
although
i
don't
agree
with
it,
that
the
constitutional
provision
which
says
congress
can...
can
make
exceptions
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
should
not
be
interpreted
to
exclude
significant
constitutional
claims.
but
when
congress
has
gone
to
the
trouble
of
providing
for
judicial
review
of
any
claims
that
are
significant
and
just
saying
any
other
insignificant
action,
even
though
a
constitutional
violation
is
alleged
in
connection
with
it,
if
in
fact
it
does
not
harm
you
that
much,
we're
not
going
to
allow
judicial
review,
what
is...
what
is
wrong
with
that?
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
congress
has
said
and...
and
you're
creating
a
scheme
that
simply
contradicts
what
congress
plainly
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
any
of
them
involve
a
situation
in
which
congress
took
the
pain
to
separate
significant
actions
from
insignificant
actions?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
some
of
them
involve
deportation
and,
you
know,
major...
major
actions.
this
is
a
case
where
congress
has...
has
carefully
tried
to
say
these
are
major
actions
for
which
you
should
be
able
to
get
into
the
courts.
and
these
other
things...
you...
you
have
these
administrative
remedies,
but
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
second
statute?
there's
no
second
statute
here.
there...
there
is
your
concession
of
the
fact
that
there
has
to
be
judicial
review.
that's
what's
driving
all
of
this.
and...
and
generally
speaking,
when
we
find
something
to
be
unconstitutional,
we
don't
rewrite
a
statute
so
that
it
will
be
constitutional.
we
just
say,
you
know,
there
has
to
be
judicial
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
if...
if
we're
going
to
tweak
the
statute,
isn't
the
least
possible
tweak...
and
perhaps
not
a
tweak
at
all...
simply
to
consider
this
a
personnel
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
a
decision
to
order
psychiatric
testing
can
be
one,
why
can't
a
decision
to
require
drug
testing
be
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
tweak
at
all.
it...
it
just
depends
on...
on
what
you
consider
to
be
working
conditions.
and
in...
in
many
contexts,
we've
given
the
broadest
possible
interpretation
to
working
conditions.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i--
