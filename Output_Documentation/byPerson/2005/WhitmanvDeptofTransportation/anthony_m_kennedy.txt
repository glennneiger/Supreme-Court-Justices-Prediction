was
it
raised?
was
that
objection,
the
jurisdictional
question,
raised
in
the
briefs
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
grievance
procedure
covers
it,
and
you
took
pains
to
point
out
to
us
that
when
you
go
to
the
grievance
procedure,
you're
not
necessarily
entitled
to
findings
and...
and
written
conclusions,
et
cetera.
but
there's
a
reason
for
that.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
these
things
can
be
very,
very
minor.
so
now
you're
saying
that
just
because
the...
the
grievance
procedure
doesn't
entitle
you
necessarily
to
findings,
et
cetera,
that
you
can
go
into
court.
but
the
only
reason
you
don't
get
those
findings
is
because
we
know,
going
in,
that
they're
so
minor.
so
now
the
most
minor
things
go
to
court.
that
seems
very
anomalous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
what
the
congressional
intent
would
be
to
bifurcate
the
constitutional
and
the
statutory
claims,
especially
if
they're
the
same
thing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
what...
that's
what
you're
asking
us
to
say.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if...
if...
under...
under
your
explanation
of
how
the
system
works,
you
go
to
district
court
with
a
constitutional
claim.
he's...
he...
the
district
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
statutory
claim
first?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
this
is
a
very
odd
system
where
you
have
to
immediately
go
to
the
constitutional
claim
and
you're
foreclosed
from
looking
at
the
statutory
claim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
in
those
circuits
which
allow
these
cases
to
go
to
courts,
has
there
been
any
indication
that
the
courts
are
flooded
with
a
number
of
these
cases
or--
