mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
is
congruent
and
proportional
as
applied
to
the
prison
setting
for
essentially
three
reasons.
the
first
is
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
right
that's
at
stake
in
the
prison
setting.
as
in
the
access-to-courts
setting,
this
is
a
setting
where
states
have
affirmative
constitutional
duties,
including,
in
many
circumstances,
duties
of
accommodation
of
inmates'
disabilities.
the
second
reason
relates
to
the
record
of
constitutional
violations
in
this
context,
a
record
in
the
context
of
state
treatment
of
inmates
with
disabilities
that
is
extensive,
that
is
judicially
documented
and
confirmed
on
a
nationwide
basis.
and
the
third
reason
relates
to
the
[*13]
tailoring
of
the
ada
remedy,
which
the
--
which
general
clement
has
spoken
about
to
some
extent
already
--
both
limitations
inherent
in
the
ada
itself
and
in
the
plra,
which
fully
applies
to
ada
cases.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
there
is
not.
the
same...
the
record
of
constitutional
violations
is
nationwide.
we
don't
have
any
judicial
findings--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--of
constitutional
violations--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--by
georgia.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i
mean,
of
course,
in
this
case,
the
lower
court
said
that
there
might
have
been
a
constitutional
violation
that
allowed
that
claim
to
proceed
in
the--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--companion--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
we
think
the
prophylactic
measures
are
justified
by
the
nationwide
record,
just
as
in
this
court's
case--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
that's
this
court's
cases
on
prophylactic
nationwide
legislation,
absolutely.
you
know,
in
tennessee
versus
lane,
this
court
upheld
nationwide
prophylactic
legislation
on
the
basis
of
a
record
that
included
constitutional
violations
in
only
eight
states.
here,
we
have
a
record
that
touches
on
at
least
37
states,
if
you
look
in
pages
20
to
36
of
our
opening
brief.
in--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that's--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--i
believe
that
was
pre-ada,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
but
i
think
that
the
point...
the
point
is
that
the
record
of
constitutional
violations
here
is
a
nationwide
record.
it's
a
record
that
includes
some
incidents
from
georgia.
it's
a
record
that
includes
many
incidents
from
many
other
states;
as
i
say,
37
different
states.
it's
a
record
of
constitutional
violations
that's
been
judicially
confirmed.
we
have
courts
actually
finding--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--in
final
adjudications--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--constitutional
violations.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i
think
that's...
i
mean,
i
think
that's
because
they
exclude--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--juvenile
facilities
from
their--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--consideration.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
right.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
the...
i
mean--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--you
know--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
would
say,
in
georgia,
of
course,
state
and...
of
course,
local
facilities
are
arms
of
the
state
in
georgia.
that's
been
the
judicial
holding.
and
so,
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes,
we
would
consider
them.
but
i
would
say
the
record
of
constitutional
violations
here
that
justifies
nationwide
prophylaxis
is
really
far
more
extensive
than
the
record
that's
been
before
this
court
in
tennessee
v.
lane
and
nevada
v.
hibbs
and
touches
on
touches
on
even
more
states
than,
you
know,
the
nationwide
literacy
test
ban
that
was
upheld
in
oregon
v.
mitchell.
at
the
time
this
court
upheld
that,
only
22
states
had
literacy
tests,
i
think.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
in
determining
whether
the
evidence
before
congress
was
sufficient,
i
think,
you
know,
this
court
has
said...
i
think
the
standard
comes
from
city
of
boerne...
it's
the
congruence
and
proportionality
test,
but
it
recognizes
that
congress
has
to
have
a
great
deal
of
leeway
in
determining
where
the
line
between
enforcement
and
substantive
change
in
the
law
lies.
and,
you
know,
here
we
have,
whatever
standard
we
use,
the
kind
of
record
of
constitutional
violations
that
justifies
prophylaxis.
we
have...
we
have
constitutional
rights
that
impose
on
states
obligations
of
accommodation.
so,
the
ada
is,
in
no
circumstance--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
as
i
said,
i
think
the...
i
do
think
that
the
proper
standard
should
be
the
city
of
boerne
standard
of
congruence
and
proportionality,
exercised
with
the
kind
of
deference
that
this
court
said
in
boerne,
which
i
think
this
court
adopted
in
lane,
to
the
factfinding
capabilities
of
the...
of
the...
of
the
congress.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
there
is
clearly
a
difference.
right?
there's
a
prophylactic
sweep
to
the
statute.
it's
just
that
it's
not
very
much,
in
this
context,
for
a
number
of
reasons,
one
being
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
rights,
that
they
impose
requirements
that
are
affirmative
duties,
the
other
being
the
way
the
reasonableness
language
of
the
ada
has
been
consistently
read
by
lower
courts
to
take
account
of
context,
and
another
being
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
which
further
ties
the
ada
to
the--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--constitutional
violation.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
i
think
that
the
approach
of
taking
into
account
the
significant
state
interest
in
uniform
treatment
in
the
prison
setting
uniquely,
yes,
is
very
much
consistent
with
what
congress
had
in
mind,
just
as
this
court,
in
the
cutter
case,
you
know,
read
the
"compelling
state
interest"
language,
much
more
stringent
language
about
the...
about
what
the
state
has
to
satisfy...
as
taking--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--account
of--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--these
concerns.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i
think
there
are
two
sides
to
that
coin.
i
think,
definitely,
the
scope
of
the
ada
in
the
prison
setting,
you
know,
is
important.
i
think
that
the
lower
court's
reading
of
mr.
goodman
alleges,
may
be
entirely
unreasonable,
where
what's
at
stake
is
attending
an
arts-and-crafts
class,
or
something
like
that.
so,
i
think
that
is
important,
but
i
think
the
flip
side
of
the...
of
the
state's
complete
control
over
every
aspect
of
the
inmate's
environment
is,
this
is
one
of
the
few
areas
of
government
where
states
have
affirmative
constitutional
duties,
including--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--you
know,
i
don't
know
the
figures
for
that.
perhaps
the
solicitor
general
can
answer
as
to
what
the
burden
has
been
on
the
federal
government.
i
think,
you
know,
the
solicitor
general
states
in
his
brief...
in
his
reply
brief,
particularly...
that
the
burden
has
not
been
significant,
the
government--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--has
not--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--that's
true.
it
does
apply
to
state
prisons,
as
well,
justice
ginsburg.
however,
we...
you
know,
we
obviously
can't
be
sure
that
it's
always
going
to
cover
every
state
prison.
it
hasn't,
at
times,
in
the
past.
it
might
not,
at
times,
in
the
future.
i
think,
you
know,
one
of
the
significant
aspects
of
the
rehabilitation
act
is...
and
i
think
the
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
mr.
goodman
by
the
former
president
george
h.
w.
bush
really
emphasizes
this...
the
ada
was
passed
based
on
a
firm
conclusion
by
congress
that
the
rehabilitation
act
had
failed,
that
it
hadn't
worked.
and
i
think
the
record
of
constitutional
violations
here
shows
that,
that
we
have
such
an
extensive
record
of
judicially
confirmed,
judicially
established
findings
of
constitutional
violations
in
the
prison
context,
and
we
have
constitutional
rights
that
impose
on
states
the
same
kinds
of
requirements,
not
in
all
particulars,
but
in
very
similar
ways,
as
the
ada
does,
itself.
i
think
that's
where...
that's
where
the
congruence
and
proportionality
really
comes
in.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
a
couple
of
points
about
that.
i
mean,
the
first
is
the
deterrent
function
of
damages
is
really
essential
in
this
context.
i
think
that's
the
import
of
the
record
of
constitutional
violations.
section
1983
failed.
i
think
the
second
point
about
damages
is,
they're
very
limited
in
the
prison
context.
they're
limited
by
this
court's
decision
in
barnes,
no
punitives.
they're--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--the
ada
could
allow
equitable
remedies,
but...
could
certainly--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--allow--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think,
you
know,
this...
something
this
court
has
said
repeatedly,
that
the
deterrent
function
of
damages
is
important...
and
here,
we
have...
we
have
a
very
good...
we
have
very
good
evidence
that
we
need
deterrents
in
this
context.
we
need
deterrents
because
constitutional
violations
have
continued
and
continued.
but
i--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--think
that--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--but--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
there--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--i
think
it--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
you
know,
i
think
that
the...
with
respect
to
constitutional
violations
that
might
not
relate
to
people
with
disabilities,
you
know,
that's
something
congress
could
certainly
consider
in
other
legislation.
here,
congress
would...
have,
staring
in
front
them...
right
+/?
a
record
of
constitutional
violations
that
showed...
right
+/?
proven
constitutional
violations
showed
that
the
1983
remedy,
which
doesn't
authorize
damages
against
the
state,
wasn't
working.
we
need
to
have
some
additional
remedy.
we
need
some
additional
deterrents
and
spur
to
compliance
on
the
part
of
states.
but
i
think
it's
also
important
to
note
how
limited
the
damages
remedy
in
this
context
is.
it's
not
just
the
absence
of
punitive
damages.
it's
not
just...
you
know,
we
also
have
the
provision
of
the
plra
that
says
no
damages
for
mental
and
emotional
injury
in
the
absence
of
physical
injury,
which
means
that,
in
the
kinds
of
cases
that
are
peripheral
to
core
constitutional
rights,
we're
not
going
to
have
damages
anyway.
it
also...
we
also
have
the
exhaustion
requirement
of
the
plra,
which
imposes
on
plaintiff
the
requirement
that
they
go
to
the
prison
and
tell
them,
plra,
we're
very
likely
to
have
deliberate
indifference,
a
problem
that
prison
officials
have
refused
to
resolve--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think
that,
of
course,
the
prison
can
reduce
its
damages
liability,
and,
of
course,
where
we
have
a
continuing
violation
after
exhaustion,
which
is
what...
when
people
file
these
lawsuits,
when
they
have
continuing
problems,
like
mr.
goodman
alleges
were
continuing
problems
in
his
case...
we
will
have
cases
where
we
have
very
much...
very
likely
to
have
deliberate
indifference.
and
so,
i
think
that's
an
important
thing,
too.
i
think
the
other
important
point
about
turner
v.
safley
that
the
solicitor
general
spoke
about...
right
+/?
many
of
the
constitutional
rights
in
the
prison
setting
that
are
significant
here
don't
implicate
turner
v.
safley.
eighth
amendment
cruel-and-unusual-punishment
claims
don't
implicate
turner
v.
safley,
as
this
court
said
in
the
johnson
case.
and
we
have
a
very
substantial
record
of
eighth
amendment
violations.
of
course,
the
eighth
amendment
requires
accommodation
of
serious
medical
needs,
as
this
court
has
said
ever
since
estelle
v.
gamble,
and
ada.
and
so,
i
think
another
very
significant
aspect
of
the
congruence
and
proportionality
here
is
how
close
the
ada's
disability
definition
is
to
the
class
of
people
who
implicate
constitutional
rights,
affirmative
constitutional
rights
of
accommodation,
under
the
eighth
amendment
itself.
and
so,
i
think
that's
another
very
significant
aspect
of
the
tightness
of
the
fit
here.
but,
here,
i
think
the
most
salient
fact
is,
if
you
ever
had
a
record
justifying
prophylaxis
nationwide,
the
record
here,
that
touches
on
37
different
states,
that
includes,
in
many
cases,
statewide
findings
of
constitutional
violations,
is
it,
it's
a
record
that
justifies,
certainly,
some
prophylactic
legislation;
at
least...
at
the
very
least,
the
minimal
prophylaxis
that
we
have
in
the
ada
in
the
prison
setting.
it's
a
kind
of...
it's
a
kind
of
prophylaxis
that's
very
much
like
the
kind
of
prophylaxis
this
court
has
previously
upheld
in
tennessee
v.
lane,
where
we
had
very
similar
affirmative
constitutional
obligations,
and
in
nevada
v.
hibbs,
where
we
had
a
much
less
significant
record,
nationwide,
of
constitutional
violations.
and
so,
for
all
those
reasons,
you
know,
we
believe
that
the
ada
is
congruent
and
proportional
in
the
prison
setting.
and
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--okay.
okay.
