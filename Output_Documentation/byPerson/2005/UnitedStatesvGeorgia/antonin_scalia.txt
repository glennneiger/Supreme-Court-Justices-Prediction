justice
antonin
scalia
general--
justice
antonin
scalia
--clement,
i'm
interested
in
another
statute
that
has
applicability
in
the
circumstances,
and
that's
section
1983
and
the
prison
litigation
reform
act.
under
the...
under
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
if
you're
bringing
a
constitutional
claim
under
section
1983,
you
have
to
exhaust
your
prison
remedies
before
you
can
do
that.
and
that
is
not
the
case
here,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
those
violations
that
you
allude
to...
is
there
an
extensive
record
of
violations
by
the
state
of
georgia?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
money--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
not
coming
from
the
nation,
it's
coming
from
the
state
of
georgia.
was
the
state
of
georgia
guilty
of
constitutional
violations?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
my--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean
a
record...
a
record
that
would
have
justified
applying,
against
the
state
of
georgia,
prophylactic
measures.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
against
people
who
played
no
part
in
that
nationwide
record.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
was
that
before
or
after
the
enactment
of
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
looking
at
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
the
chart
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
which
shows
that
there
are,
for
georgia...
and
it
lists
all
the
states...
for
georgia,
zero
arguable
state
violations
prior
to
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--state
and
local
violations.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
state
and
local
units
don't
enjoy
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
need
this
act
to
sue
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
don't
you
need
it
for
1983
violations?
justice
antonin
scalia
constitutional
violations.
not
just
prophylaxis--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
actual
constitutional
violations
by
the
prisons
under
1983--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
don't
happen
to
relate
to
the
handicapped
and,
thus,
are
not
covered
by
this
legislation.
you
can't
get
damages
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
but...
you
know,
in
1983,
when
you
exhaust
your
prison
remedies,
the
prison
fixes
what
was
wrong,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
but,
under
this
act,
you
go
through
your
prison
remedies,
what
do
you
ask
the
prison
for?
money?
the
prison
can't
give
you
money,
so
they
say,
"no,
you
can't
get
your
money.
"
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mean,
the
prison-remedy
thing
is...
the
only
thing
it
does
is
make
it
take
a
longer
time
to
get
to
court,
but
it
does
the
prison
no
good.
it's
going
to
be
liable
for
damages
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schaerr,
who's
going
to
be
representing
some
states
as
amici,
will
presumably
have
better
information
on
that
subject.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
could
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
this
opinion.
i
mean,
that
would
make
it
happen,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
castanias,
suppose
the
court
agrees
with
you
that
the
response
here
is
not
proportionate,
and,
hence,
that
the
prophylactic
aspects
of
this
statute
are
invalid.
there
remains
the
fact
that
the
statute
covers
actual
constitutional
violations
for
which
you
don't
need
any
special
proportionality.
certainly,
the
government
can
allow
the
states
to
be
sued
for
constitutional
violations.
and
the
plaintiff
here
claims
that
some
of
the
acts
he's
seeking
damages
for
do
amount
to
constitutional
violations.
how
can
we
possibly
say
that
that
suit
does
not
lie?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
lie
damages
here.
can
you
get
damages
under
1983?
justice
antonin
scalia
against
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
state
officers
don't
have
any
money.
[laughter]
we're
talking
about
damages
against
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
under--
justice
antonin
scalia
--1983--
justice
antonin
scalia
--absolutely.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
i
mean
the
portions
that
go
beyond
constitutional
violations
are
no
good.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
going
to
read
it
unrealistically
so
that
it
only
includes
constitutional
violations.
but,
to
the
extent
that
it
includes
constitutional
violations,
why
isn't
that
lawsuit
perfectly
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
just
proves
that
they
went
too
far.
it
doesn't
prove
that,
to
the
extent
that
it
covers
a
constitutional
violation,
it's
okay.
we
will
say
the
excess
is
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
they're
bad,
why
aren't
the
other
ones
good?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
11th
circuit.
the
petitioner
in
no.
04-1236,
tony
goodman,
is
a
paraplegic
inmate
of
the
georgia
prison
system.
he
filed
a
pro
se
complaint
in
the
district
court
against
the
state,
challenging
the
conditions
of
his
confinement.
he
alleged
that
the
prison
system
did
not
take
account
of
his
disability
in
ways
that
made
the
conditions
of
his
confinement
quite
cruel.
he
brought
claims
seeking
money
damages
under
title
ii
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
and
under
the
eighth
amendment,
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause.
the
district
court
dismissed
his
eighth
amendment
claims
as
defectively
plead
and
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
state
on
his
title
ii
claims
for
money
damages
on
the
ground
that
these
claims
were
barred
by
state
sovereign
immunity.
goodman
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
11th
circuit.
and
the
united
states,
the
petitioner
in
the
second
case
here,
04-1203,
intervened
on
appeal
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
title
ii’s
abrogation
of
state
sovereign
immunity.
the
11th
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court’s
judgment
as
to
goodman’s
title
ii
claims
for
money
damages,
holding
them
barred
by
sovereign
immunity;
but
it
reversed
the
district
court’s
dismissal
of
his
eighth
amendment
claims.
it
held
that
goodman
had
successfully
alleged
a
limited
number
of
eighth
amendment
violations
and
instructed
the
district
court
on
remand
to
permit
goodman
to
amend
his
complaint.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
title
ii
of
the
ada
validly
abrogates
state
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
goodman’s
claims.
we
now
reverse
the
11th
circuit
on
this
point.
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
gives
congress
the
power
to,
“enforce”,
the
guarantees
set
forth
in
the
earlier
sections
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
whatever
the
extent
of
congress’s
prophylactic
enforcement
powers
under
section
5
--
that
is,
its
power
to
forbid
some
actions
by
the
states
that
are
not
in
themselves
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
section
5
indisputably
grants
congress
the
power
to
create
remedies
against
the
states
for
actual
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
enforcement
power
includes,
of
course,
the
power
to
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity
by
authorizing
private
suits
for
money
damages.
because
it
is
not
challenged
on
this
appeal,
we
assume
without
deciding
that
the
11th
circuit’s
treatment
of
goodman’s
eighth
amendment
claims
was
correct.
in
addition,
because
it
is
not
disputed
here,
we
assume
without
deciding
that
the
same
alleged
conduct
that
violated
the
eighth
amendment
also
violated
title
ii
of
the
ada.
therefore,
goodman’s
claims
for
money
damages
against
the
state
under
title
ii
were
evidently
based,
at
least
in
large
part,
on
conduct
that
independently
violated
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
hold
that
title
ii’s
abrogation
sovereign
immunity
as
to
such
claims
is
indisputably
valid.
from
the
many
allegations
in
goodman’s
pro
se
filings,
it
is
not
clear
precisely
what
conduct
he
intended
to
allege
in
support
of
his
title
ii
claims.
it
is
also
unclear
to
what
extent
such
conduct
also
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
once
goodman’s
complaint
is
amended
on
remand,
the
lower
courts
will
be
best
situated
to
determine,
in
the
first
instance,
which
aspects
of
the
state’s
alleged
conduct
violated
title
ii,
to
what
extent
such
misconduct
also
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
and,
insofar
as
such
misconduct
violated
title
ii,
but
did
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment,
whether
congress’s
purported
abrogation
of
sovereign
immunity
as
to
that
class
of
conduct
is
nevertheless
valid.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
court’s
decision
is
unanimous;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
