of
course,
all
of
the
concerns
you've
mentioned
could
be
taken
care
of
by
injunctive
relief.
you
don't
necessarily
need
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
we
held
the
act
was
applicable
for
injunctive
relief,
it
would...
it
would
be,
because
i'm...
the
pert
part
of
your
argument
is
that
you
could
have
a
attorneys
fees
and
triple
damages
where
trial
attorneys
levy
against
the
state
treasury,
which
is...
which
is
what
the
eleventh
amendment
is
largely
concerned
with.
that...
all
of
that
would
follow
from
what
you've
said
so
far.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
they're
not
available
under
title
ii,
but,
i
mean,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
there's
certainly
nothing
barring
them,
based
on
what
you've
told
us
so
far.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
so
clear
that
damages
are
necessary
and
that
equitable
relief
shouldn't
suffice?
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
puzzling...
it's
puzzling
to
me,
the
notion
that
trial
attorneys
and
their
clients
can
levy
upon
the
funds
in
state
treasuries
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
why
is
it
congruent
and
proportional
to
allow
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
where
you
say
section
1983
failed,
the
ada
could
allow
equitable
remedies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
why--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
why
shouldn't
that...
why
shouldn't
that
suffice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
saying
this
to
help
you.
i'd
love
to
get
reason
2.
i'm
wondering--
[laughter]
