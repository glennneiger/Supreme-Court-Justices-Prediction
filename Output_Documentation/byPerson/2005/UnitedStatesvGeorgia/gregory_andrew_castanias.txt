mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
sit
down
today,
i'd
like
to
make
three
basic
points,
and
hopefully
i'll
get
to
make...
elaborate
on
each
of
them
a
little
bit.
first
of
all,
this
case
is
not
anything
like
tennessee
versus
lane.
it
doesn't
involve
the
very
important
civil
right
of
access
to
courts,
access
to
voting
booths,
or
anything
like
that.
it
involves--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i
believe
that's
correct--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--your
honor.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
from
reading
the
opinion,
that
right
was
the
specific
right
to
access
the
courts.
it's
the
public
right
of
access
to
see
court
proceedings,
like
the
people--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--it's
the
right
of
access
to
courts,
specifically,
that
was
the
context
that
was...
that
was
created
for
purpose
of
the
as-applied
analysis
in
lane.
the
second
point
i
hope
i'll
get
to
address
today
is
the
very
fundamental
differences
between
the
prison
context
the...
and
the
courthouse
context
at
issue
in
lane,
and
the
reasons
why
the
prison
context
that
it's...
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
makes
this
case
so
fundamentally
different.
the
prison
context,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
is
one
where
issues
of
safety
and
security
and,
as
well,
from
the
court's
decisions,
issues
of
federalism
and
deference
to
prison
officials
hold
sway.
those
were
not
at
issue
in
lane,
and
they--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--have
a--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
respectfully,
but
strenuously,
disagree
with
that
submission,
and
i'll
give
you
a
very
good
example
of
what
they're
not
talking
about
here.
what's
happening
under
the
ada,
as
a
practical
matter
in
the
prison
context,
is
that
it's
giving
prisoners
trials
on
issues
like
whether
or
not
they
have
access
to
the
television
room
in
the
prison.
that's
not
a
constitutional
right.
before
the
ada,
that
was
never
understood
to
be
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
i'm
not
aware,
justice
ginsburg,
of
any
court
of
appeals
that
has
ruled
on
that
yet,
but
i
am
aware
of
two
district
court
cases...
i
could
give
you
the
names
of
them...
where
summary
judgment
was
denied,
and
a
trial
was
given
to
the
inmate.
one
is
brown
against
king
county
department
of
adult
corrections--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--justice
ginsburg,
without
making
any
representations
that
i
am
going
to
canvas
the
universe
on
this,
i
have
not
seen
a
case
where
the
district
court
has
rejected
a
trial
in
that
respect.
and
i
think,
your
honor,
this
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
one
of
the
fundamental
problems--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--sure.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
have
any
data
on
that,
and
we
haven't...
we
don't
have
any
in
our
brief.
the
solicitor
general's
data
that
he
put
in
on
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
came
in
his
reply
brief,
and
we
certainly
haven't
had--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--an
opportunity--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--to
pull
that
together.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
the
rehabilitation
act
is
a
little
different
than
the
ada,
but
it
certainly
is
protective
of
many
of
the
same
rights.
i
would
think
it
would
be
protective
of
all
of
the
same
constitutional
rights
that
the--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--well,
as
i
understand
it,
justice
o'connor,
the
spending
clause
power
can
be
hived
down
on
a
program-by-program
basis,
not
just
as
whether
the
state
itself
is
receiving
it.
so,
without
knowing
specifically
whether
we're
talking
about
the
particular
program--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
as
i
stand
here,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
i--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
you're
right
to
say
that,
except
that
that's
not
what
the
act
says.
the
act
says--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--that's
exactly
right,
and
that...
and
the
reasonable...
the
reasonable-accommodation
or
reasonable-modification
standard
of
the
ada,
both
generally
and
specifically
in
title
ii,
imposes
an
affirmative
burden
on
the
states,
which
is
very
much
unlike
the
rational-basis
test
of
cleburne.
it's
very
much
unlike
the
rational-relationship
test
of
turner
against
safley.
quite
the
contrary,
what
happens
in
these
cases...
and
this
comes
up
in
the
television
cases,
as
well
as
the
access-to-chapels
cases
or
any
of
the...
any
of
the
cases
that
the
petitioners
have
hypothesized...
what
happens
in
that
case
is,
the
petitioner
pleads
that,
"i
could
access
this
if
i
only
had
a
reasonable
accommodation.
"
and
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
state,
at
that
point,
to
not
just
articulate
reasonable
grounds,
but
to,
in
fact,
prove
that
it
is
not
reasonable
or
that
it
would
be
an
undue
burden.
there
is
a
case
that
the...
that
petitioner
goodman
has
cited
in
both
of
his
briefs
to
this
court,
out
of
the
seventh
circuit,
called
love
against
westville
correctional
facility...
comes
out
indiana...
and
this
case
is
a
great
example
of
why,
justice
breyer,
the
turner
against...
the
turner
against
safley
integration
into
the
reasonableness
provisions
of
ada
title
ii
won't
work,
and
isn't
congruent
and
proportional,
because--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--it
is.
it's
in
both
the...
petitioner
goodman's
opening
and
reply
briefs.
in
the
love
case...
and
this
is...
this
is
a
law-school
exam
case,
because
the
prisoner
put
forth
his
case,
and
the
state
of
indiana,
while
it
was
pre-yeskey,
nonetheless
agreed
that
the
ada
applied
to
the
prison
and,
at
the
same
time,
didn't
present
any
evidence.
and
the
prisoner
won
the
case.
and
they
won
the
case,
because
all
the
state
did
is
articulate
reasons,
like
there
was...
it
would
cost
too
much.
and
this
court
very
clearly
said,
"look,
you
didn't
put
any
evidence.
"
"you
lose.
"
now,
that's
what...
that
was
one
of
the
fundamental
factors
that
caused
this
court
to
find,
in
both
kimel
and
garrett,
the
statutes
unconstitutional,
because
the--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--you--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--but
you--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--you
could...
i
mean,
you
could
absolutely
say
it.
you...
the
court
can
say
anything
it
wants
here.
but
the
problem
is,
is
that
this
was...
this
was
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
with
ada
title
i--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--and
with
the
adea--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--well,
i'm...
i...
justice
ginsburg,
were...
if
this
court
were
to
uphold
the
damages
remedy
in
this
case,
this
would
be
what
the
states
would
be
left
to
argue.
and
in...
while
it
is
true
that
you
have
said,
in
a
couple
of
recent
cases,
that
strict
scrutiny
is
not
quite
as
fatal,
in
fact,
as
usual,
that
strict-scrutiny
case
that
you're
referring
to
is
the
true
exception
in
the
prison
context,
where
strict
scrutiny
was
applied.
and
it
involved
the
very
important,
very
core
fourteenth
amendment
right
against
racial
discrimination.
here,
we're
talking
about
a
statute
that
was
framed
by
congress
as
basically
trying
to
change
the
cleburne
rule,
trying
to
bring
an
added
level
of
scrutiny
to
claims,
equal-protection--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--type
claims.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
that's
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg.
and,
in
fact,
the
reason
that
the
plaintiffs
won
is
that
the
state,
in
that
case,
the
state
defendants,
offered
four
reasons,
all
of
which
were
found
to
be
not
legitimate
state
reasons.
it
was
a
straightforward
application
of
the
rational--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--basis
test.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
i
think
that
the
tennessee
solicitor
general
moore,
at
the
end
of
the
lane
argument,
said,
"we
have
to
take
the
court
as...
for
what
it
does
say.
"
and
it
said
it
was
applying
rational-basis
scrutiny
in
that
case.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all
is,
section
1983
already
did
that.
and
the
reason
that
that...
that
may
not--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--absolutely.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
you
can
get
it
against
state
officers
acting--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--well,
you
cannot
get
damages
against
the
state--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--under
section--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--1983,
that's--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--right.
that
is
exactly
right.
but
the
other
answer,
justice
scalia,
is
that
to
get
to
that
result...
and
i
think
it's
remarkable
that
both
petitioners'
counsel
stood
up
here,
and
the
way
they
framed
the
question
was,
"this
is
just
remedial
for
these
actual
constitutional
violations
in
prison.
"
to
get
to
that
result,
you
would
have
to
rewrite
the
ada
in
a
way
that
would
make
the
reasonable-modification
or
reasonable
accommodations
provision
basically
an
empty
vessel
to
put
whatever
constitutional
law
you
want
in--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--let
me...
let
me...
let
me
pause
for
a
second
and
think
about
that.
the...
i
think
the
problem
with
that...
my
instinct
is
that
there
is
a
problem
with
that,
and
i
think
the
problem
with
that...
not
just
because,
your
honor,
i
represent
the
state...
but
i
think
the
problem
with
that
is
that
it
is,
in
no
way,
congruent
to
the
constitutional
rights.
in
other
words,
what
it's
doing
is,
it's
giving,
only
to
a
limited
class
of
prisoners,
a
particular
set
of
rights.
in
a
way,
this
is
the...
this
is
the
underbreadth
argument
that
we
made
in
our
brief
that
the...
that
the
petitioners,
in
their
replies,
made
fun
of
a
little
bit.
but,
quite
honestly,
this
is...
this...
it
would
be
giving
disabled
inmates...
making
them
into
a
special
class
for
purposes
of
constitutional
violations
that
don't
apply
just
to
disabled
inmates
at
all.
quite
the--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--contrary--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i
think,
justice
breyer,
with
regard
to
lane,
the
right
that
was
at
issue
was
not
the
right
of
the
paper
to
send
a
reporter,
it
was
the
right
of
the
reporter--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--no,
actually,
justice--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--justice
breyer,
i
think...
i
think
i
either
misstated
my
answer
to
you,
because
i
was
trying
to--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--let
me
try
to
answer
that
and--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--say
to
you
that
i
think,
first
of
all,
the
first
amendment
right
that
was
at
issue
there
was
the
general
right
that's
possessed
by
the
public
to
attend
court
proceedings,
not
just
a
right
that
was
inherent
in
the
newspaper
or
the...
a
right
that
was
prophylactically
being
exercised
there.
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
the
petitioner's
counsel
about
alternative
remedies
here,
and
i
think
there's
an
important
point
to
make
with
regard
to
title
iii
of
the
ada,
and
that's
the
title
of
the
ada
that
applies,
not
to
public
entities,
as
we
have
here,
like
the
state
prison,
but
the
title
that
applies
to
public
accommodations,
like
restaurants
and
hotels.
and
it's
important
to
note,
i
think,
that,
in
that
title,
congress
did
not
provide
for
money-damages
remedies.
quite
the
contrary,
it
provided
for
an
attorney
general
action,
and
it
provided
for
injunctive
relief.
and
so,
the
notion
that
states
somehow
are
special
and
should
be
the
ones
that
get
damages
against
them
for
violating
the...
violating
access
rights
is,
in
words
that
the
court
has
used...
in
boerne
and
the
cases
following
it,
that
is
a
real
indignity
to
the
states.
and,
beyond
that,
the
standard
that
applies--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i'm
not
sure,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
follows
that
damage...
that
damages
follow
from
that
observation.
and
i
think,
with
regard
to
the
choices
that
are
available
to
prisons,
much
has
been
made
in
this
case
about
the
affirmative
obligations
of
the
state
to
provide
the
minimum
standards
of
health
and
safety
for
prisoners.
and
i'd
point
out
that,
in
the
court's
decision
in
deshaney...
specifically,
footnote
7...
the
former
chief
justice
wrote
for
the
court
that,
in
determining
both
the
scope
and
how
to
satisfy
those,
there
is
an
enormous
amount
of
discretion
imposed
in
the
state.
so,
it's
hard
to
say
that
that
provision
is
allowing
for...
that
minimal
affirmative
burden
that's
on
the
state
is
in
any
way
congruent
with
the
broad
affirmative
remedies
that
are
at
stake
in
this
case.
now,
if
i
could
just
go
through,
very
quickly,
the
various
constitutional
rights
that
are
being
addressed
here
by
the...
that
are
being
claimed
here
by
the
petitioner,
you
can
see,
in
each
case,
why
it's
not
a
proportional
and
congruent
remedy
to
use
title
ii
of
the
ada
to
enforce
them.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
it's
almost
obvious,
from
the
findings
of
congress,
that
they
meant
to
impose
a
higher
degree
of
scrutiny.
by
citing
the
words
of
carolene
products,
as
well
as
matthews
against
lucas,
that's...
have
justified
heightened
scrutiny
to
apply
to
the
disabled,
this
is
almost
proof
positive
that
title
ii...
and
the
ada,
in
general...
is
changing
the
level
of
constitutional
law.
it's
not
enforcing;
it's
changing
the
law.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
comes
back
to
kimel
and
garrett.
the
excessive
change
in
the
constitutional
law
was
held
to
have
crossed
the
line
in
that
case.
and
here,
we
have
the
same
problems.
we
have
the
changing
of
the
burdens.
we
have
the
changing
of
the
level
of
scrutiny.
and
we
have
the
efforts,
the
same
efforts
that
were
used
in
kimel
and
garrett--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--to
make--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i
think
it
was,
justice
stevens,
because
you
can
only
talk
about
the
conceivable
remedies
in
the
context
of
what
the
state
puts
forth.
and
perhaps
a
creative
judge
could
say,
"aha,
but
that's
the
state...
you
didn't
think
about
this
one.
"
and
the
fact
that
justice
white's
opinion...
i
think
it
was
justice
white's
opinion
for
the
court
in
cleburne...
didn't
go
on
and
think
about
four
other
conceivable
bases,
i
don't
think
is
a
fault
of
the
decisionmaking
process
at
all.
with
regard
to
the
petitioner's
efforts
to
enforce
the
guarantee
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
there
is
no
intent
standard
in
the
ada
at
all.
in
fact,
this
would
scrub
out
the
deliberate-indifference
standard
entirely,
and,
in
the...
at
least
goodman's
reply
brief,
he
admits
that
that
basically
would
be
what
would
happen.
he
says
that
would
be
appropriate
prophylaxis.
i
think
that
is
an
astonishing
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
and
in
that
case,
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
could
just
briefly--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--conclude?
in
that
case,
justice
ginsburg,
the
constitution,
through
section
1983,
does
provide
a
remedy.
it
will
provide
a
remedy
that
will
get
the
prison
to
stop
that.
if
there
