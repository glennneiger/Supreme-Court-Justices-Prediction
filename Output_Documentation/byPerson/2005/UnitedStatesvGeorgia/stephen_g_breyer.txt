justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is...
it's
relevant
to
the...
i
just
saw
these
as...
i...
just
by
chance,
it...
one
of
the
cases
in
the
sg's
brief
involved
georgia
juvenile
facilities,
where
mentally
ill
patients
were
restrained,
hit,
shackled,
put
in
restraint
chairs
for
hours,
sprayed
with
pepper
spray.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
seemed
to
be
one
instance
coming
out
of
georgia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
was
there...
there
was
a
reporter
who
was
one
of
the
disabled
people,
i
think,
wasn't
there,
in
tennessee
versus
lane?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
right
that
that
reporter
has
that's
specific
to
courthouses?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
was
there
any
problem
of
that
in
tennessee
versus
lane?
i
thought
the
courthouse
officials
there
said,
"there'll
be
a
trial.
"
"no
problem
there,
just
whether
you
have
to
walk
up
the
steps
or
don't,
and
we'll
give
you
a
trial
down
below.
"
was
there...
it's
the
right
of
access
to
courthouse,
specially?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
point
of
view,
would
it
help
if
the
court
said...
i
guess
it
would,
but
i...
in
order
to
get
rid
of
this
problem,
if
the
court
said,
"look,
it
says
"reasonable".
"
and
of
course
a
prison
has
special
problems,
and,
referring,
say,
to
turner
versus
safley,
said
that,
"these
things
about
television
remote
controls
are
not
really,
normally,
a
matter
of
unreasonableness.
"
so,
in
other
words,
we
hit...
we...
you
give
considerable
discretion
to
the...
to
the
warden,
and
the
act
would
have
bite
in
cases
where
there
is
really
a
serious
problem,
like
this
one.
it's
alleged
to
be
a
really
serious
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
said
"reasonableness".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
is
true.
this
is
exactly
the
point
i
had
asked
about
before.
this
is
a
better
point.
because
i
thought
that
bridge
was...
that...
was
crossed
in
lane.
that
is,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that
lane
was
not
giving...
saying
it's
constitutional
to
have
prophylactic
rules.
and
that's
why
i
raised
the
reporter.
i've
never
heard
of
a
first
amendment
right
of
a
paper
to
send
a
particular
reporter.
i
mean,
if
there's
a
disabled
reporter
who
couldn't
get
into
the
courtroom,
i
guess
they
could
send
a
different
reporter.
maybe
that's
a
first
amendment
right,
but
i
have
not
heard
of
it.
so,
i
thought
that,
really,
lane
is
saying,
"you
can
sweep,
within
the
prophylactic
rules,
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not,
in
fact,
constitutional
violations,
but
simply
discrimination
against
disabled
people.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
for
a
newspaper,
for
example,
to
send
a
particular
reporter
to
the
courtroom.
that's
an
interesting
question.
i
never
thought
of
that
one.
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
don't
think
lane
stands
for
the
proposition
of
their
prophylactic
rules
being
perfectly
legitimate
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
where
you
have
a
set
of
constitutional
violations?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
was
asking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
isn't
all
that
true
of
lane?
everything
you've
said
is
also
true
of
the
prophylactic
part
of
lane.
i
mean,
i've
never
heard
that
people
took
seriously...
though
maybe
they
should
have...
but,
before
the
ada,
i
have
never
heard
there
was
a
constitutional
right
of
a
disabled
person
to
go
to
a
courthouse
on
the
second
floor.
there
were
second-floor
courthouses
all
over
the
country.
i
don't
know
that
was
true
of
the
bathrooms.
i
don't
know
it
was
true
of
a
lot
of
things
in
courthouses.
so,
i
think
your
argument
could
be
made
in
schools,
courthouses,
all
over
the
place.
and
i
take
it
that
lane
said,
"prophylaxis"...
whatever
the
word
is...
"of
that
sort"--
[laughter]
"#
is
fine
under
title
ii,
given
a
core
of
constitutional
violations.
"
so,
how
do
you
distinguish
them
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--beyond
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
average
public,
you
had
a
constitutional
right?
i
mean,
you
might
have.
i
might
be
surprised.
but,
interesting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
average
person
could
have
brought
a
lawsuit,
a
person
in
a
wheelchair,
and
said,
"all
the
courthouses
in
this
country,
or
in
this
county,
are
on
the
second
floor,
and
moreover
the
bathrooms...
i
need
a
special
bathroom.
"
and
they
would
have
won
without
the
ada.
why
did
we
need
the
ada,
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
ah,
you're
saying...
i...
what
i
just
heard
was,
it's...
the
reporter
just
was
a
stand-in
for
the
average
person,
that
the
average
person
had
these
constitutional
rights,
which
may
have
been
a--
