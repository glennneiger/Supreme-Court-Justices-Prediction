justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
it...
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
aspect,
in
turner
versus
safley,
we
said
prison
administrators
have
a
good
deal
of
latitude,
in
the
prison
context,
in
order
to
maintain
order.
now,
do
you
see
the
reasonableness
requirements
of
the
disabilities
act
as
being
congruent
with
the
turner
safley
reasonableness
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
this--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
one--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--one--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--one
concern
is
that,
in
the
prison
situation,
the
prison
is
exerting
control
over
all
aspects
of
the
prisoner's
daily
life.
that's
very
different
from
just
court
access,
as
in
tennessee
versus
lane,
and
it
could
require
very
extensive
requirements,
perhaps.
is
that
a
concern,
or
should
it
be,
in
the
"congruence
and
proportionality"
examination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--agree
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
rehab
act
contains
the
same
essential
requirements
as
ada?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
agree
that
it
applies
at
least
where
the
states
are
accepting
federal
money
for
the
prison?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
apply
in
the
prison
in
this
case...
the
rehab
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
case
cited
somewhere?
