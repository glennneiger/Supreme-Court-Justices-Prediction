justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
this?
this
problem
of...
just
troubles
me
a
little
bit.
if
we
hold
this
provision
unconstitutional
because
it
is
not
congruent
and
proportional
and
so
forth,
does
it
not
follow
that
the
title
ii
is
entirely
unconstitutional,
it
cannot
even
be
enforced
by
injunctive
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
whole
basis
for
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
i
think,
is
the
enforcement
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
true
of
title
ii,
as
well
as
title
i?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
damages
that's
at
issue
here,
but
the
entire
validity
of
title
ii.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this?
the
notion
of
our
reviewing
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence
before
congress
is
something
that's
always
seemed,
sort
of,
puzzling
to
me.
do
you
know
what...
what
is...
what
standard
do
you
suggest
that
we
should
apply
in
determining
whether
the
evidence
before
congress
was
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
understand
your
view
is
that,
whatever
the
standard
is,
you
win.
i'm
just
curious,
do
you
have
a--
[laughter]
--do
you
have
a
formulation
of
what
the
proper
standard
should
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
level
of
scrutiny
applied
in
cleburne
was
precisely
the
same
rational-basis
level
that
is
applied
in
a
lot
of
other
rational-basis
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--be
sure
i
understand
this
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you,
in
fact,
arguing
that
the
statute
might
be...
i
know
you
don't
agree
with
it...
might
be
proportionate
and
congruent
with
respect
to
all
of
its
prohibitions,
but,
to
the
extent
it
provides
for
a
damage
remedy,
then
it
crosses
the
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
is
that...
it...
because
it
has
a
damage
remedy,
or
would
it
be
equally
noncongruent
without
the
damage
remedy?
that's
what
i'm
trying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
following
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question
to
your
colleague.
