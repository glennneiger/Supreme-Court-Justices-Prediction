justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
clement,
in
two
respects,
it...
i
think
you
have
addressed
the
cost
concern
by
comparing,
in
your
brief,
the
federal
experience,
which
is
subject
to
these
controls,
and
you
said
it
wasn't
an
inordinate
expense,
but
you
also
pointed
out
that
every
state
prison
system
is
subject
to
the
rehabilitation
act,
because
they
get
federal
funds.
is
there
a
difference
between
the
obligation
that
state
systems
would
have
under
the
rehabilitation
act
and
under
the
ada?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--damage
remedies
available
under
the
rehabilitation
act
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--damages
are
available?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
applies...
it
applies
to
state
prisons,
as
well,
because
of
its
spending--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--clause
legislation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
courts
of
appeals
approved
those
determinations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
many
has
it...
in
the
district
courts,
how
many
have
been
rejected
when
it's
something
like
television
or
recreation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
before
you
do
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
i
understand
it,
and
as
the
solicitor
general
confirmed,
you
are
subject
to
the
rehabilitation
act,
where
the
substantive
scope
is
the
same.
so,
what...
you
are
saying,
in
the
prison
context,
this
is
undue,
but
you
all...
you
are
already
subject
to
it
under
one
act.
and
how
has
that
been
working
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
maybe
in
the
prison
setting,
the
lower
courts
would
pay
some
attention
to
the
court's
recent
decision
in
cutter
against
wilkinson,
where
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
a
high
level
of
deference...
even
dealing
with
a
strict-scrutiny
standard
for
religious
freedom...
that
a
high
level
of
deference
would
be
paid
to
prison
administrators'
judgment
of
what
safety
and
discipline
requires
inside
a
prison.
wouldn't
that...
wouldn't
that
carry
over
to
the
ada,
were
it
to
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
that
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
if
the
prison
explained
what
their
practices
were,
in
terms
of
the
needs
of
security,
that
a
lower
court
will
then
say,
"well,
never
mind
that.
"
"the
supreme
court
just
said
it.
"
"we
don't
have
to
enforce
it?
"
i
don't
think
there
would
be
that
kind
of
lawlessness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
interesting--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
you
cite
that
case,
in
terms
of
justice
scalia's
remark,
"watch
what
we
do,
not
what
we
say.
"
cleburne
was
a
remarkable
case
in
that
respect.
it
purported
to
apply
rational-basis
review,
but
the
plaintiffs
won.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
think
of
the...
any
conceivable
basis...
doesn't
even
have
to
be
offered
if
the...
if
it's,
indeed,
the
rational-basis
test.
it
has
been
suggested
that
something
more
is
going
on
in
cleburne,
and,
i
think,
in
all
candor,
one
would
have
to
say
so.
because
if
you
looked
at
the
rational-basis
test
that
had
gone
before,
this
one
looked
no
better,
no
worse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
go
back,
mr.
castanias,
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
core
concerns?
and
we
have
been
told
by
respondents
that
their
core
concerns
are
sanitation,
mobility,
protection
from
physical
injury.
now,
that
sounds
to
me
like
constitutional
eighth
amendment
heartland.
