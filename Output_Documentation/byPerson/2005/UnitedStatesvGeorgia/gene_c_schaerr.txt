mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
attempting
to
answer
justice
scalia's
questions...
question
about
the
rehabilitation
act.
my
understanding
is
that
the
key
difference
between
the
rehabilitation
act
and
title
ii
is
that...
is
that
the
rehabilitation
act
requires
intentional
conduct,
which,
obviously,
is
a
much...
a
much
higher
standard.
instead
of
dwelling
on
the
record
offered
in
support
of
title
ii...
and
we
agree
with
georgia
that
the
record
was
not
sufficient...
i'd
like
to
focus
on
the
congruence
and
proportionality
requirements,
which
are
quite
separate
from
the
record
requirement,
and
which
we
believe
are
independently
dispositive
in
this
case,
for
two
separate
reasons.
but,
first,
i
think
it's
important
to
recall
the
two
key
purposes
that
the
congruence-and-proportionality
analysis
serves.
one
of
those,
as
the
court
has
reiterated,
is
to
prevent
section
5
from
becoming
a
kind
of
police
power
through
which
congress
can
regulate
the
states
and
impose
litigation
and
other
burdens
on
them
as
though
they
were
mere
corporations.
the
second
purpose,
of
course,
is
ensuring
that
the
specific
remedies
that
congress
chooses,
and
especially
the
abrogation
of
sovereign
immunity...
sovereign
immunity
that
this
court
has
held
is
within
congress's
section
5
power,
are
a
measured
response
to
congress's
legitimate
goals.
and
that's
obviously
important,
because
of
the...
of
the...
of
the
tension
between
the
section
5
power,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
eleventh
amendment
and
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
that
protect--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--the
state's
sovereignty.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
yes.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i
do
believe
that
the
statute
could
be
invalidated
on
that
ground
alone,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
do
that,
because
i
think
it's
clearly
not
congruent
with
constitutional
requirements.
and
let...
and
i
believe
there
are--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--four
reasons
for
that.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--well,
the
way...
the
way
i
would
view
it
is
that
the
damage
remedy
is
disproportionate
to
congress's
legitimate
goals
in
this
case,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
number
one,
as
in...
as
in
florida
prepaid
and
some
of
this...
some
of
this
court's
other
decisions,
the
abrogation
of
sovereign
immunity
is
not
limited
to
the
specific
areas
that
congress
and
the
courts
have
identified
as
the
greatest
concern,
from
a
constitutional
standpoint.
and,
number
two,
the
abrogation
of
sovereign
immunity
is
not
limited
to
the
states,
or
categories
of
states,
where
there
has
been
a
finding
of
unconstitutional
action.
so,
we
do
think
that
that
would
be
a
sufficient
basis
to
invalidate
this
statute's
abrogation
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
we
also
think
that
the
statute
is
not
at
all
congruent
with
the
requirements
of
the
constitution.
and,
as--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--i
said,
i
think
there
are
four
reasons
for
that.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
city
of
boerne
and
other
courts...
other
decisions
of
this
court
say
that,
to
be
a
valid
exercise
of
congress's
section
5
authority,
it
has
to
be
a
response
to
a
record
of
constitutional
violations.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
and
it's
hard
for
me
to--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--true.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
no,
i'm
not
claiming
that
congress
necessarily
has
to
make
the
record,
but
i
believe
the
record
has
to
have
been
created
before
congress
acts;
otherwise,
the--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--legislation
isn't--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--a
response--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--no,
i...
i
don't
think
the
record
in
this
case
would
satisfy
it,
because
this...
because--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--well,
this
court's
decisions
suggest
that
the
record
has
to
at
least
have
been
within
congress's
awareness
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i
think
that's
correct.
again,
four
reasons
why
title
ii
is
not
congruent
with
the...
with
the
requirements
of
the
constitution.
first,
as
in
garrett,
the
substantive
accommodation
duty
imposed
by
title
ii
far
exceeds
the
requirements
of
the
constitution.
and
to
see
why,
we
need
look
no
further
than
mr.
goodman's
complaints
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
government's
addendum
c,
and
the
justice
department's
implementing
regulations,
which
are
found
at
28
c.f.r.
section
35.130(b).
and
if
you...
if
you
look
at
mr.
goodman's
complaint,
yes,
there
are
some
allegations
there
that
obviously
raise
constitutional
issues,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
allegations
that
clearly
state
a
claim
under
the
justice
department's
interpretation
of
title
ii,
but,
equally
clearly,
don't
raise
constitutional
issues.
for
example,
on
page
65,
he
has
a
claim
seeking
to
make
the
tv
lounge
and
other
entertainment
facilities
wheelchair
accessible.
pages
53,
57,
and
82,
he
makes
a
claim
for
better
access
to
recreation
facilities,
rehabilitative
exercises,
and
physical
therapy.
at
page
64
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
makes
a
claim
to
force
the
state
to
install
wheelchair-accessible
bathrooms.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
okay.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
in
order
to
abrogate
the
state's
sovereign
immunity,
there
has
to
have
been
a
valid
exercise
of
congress's
power,
and
there
has
to
be
a
statute
that
represents
a
valid
exercise
of
that
power;
otherwise,
there's
no
basis
for
subjecting
the
states
to
liability.
so,
i
don't
think
it's
enough
just
to
say,
"maybe
there...
maybe
there
is
an
eighth
amendment
claim
here
that's
legitimate,
and
maybe,
therefore,
in
this
case,
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
can
be
abrogated.
"
it
has
to
be
done
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
exercise
of
congress's
power.
reason
number
two,
justice
kennedy,
is
that,
as
in
boerne
and
garrett,
even
where
constitutional
issues
are
implicated,
title
ii
effectively
imposes
heightened
scrutiny
on
many
decisions
that
are
subject
to
rational-basis
review
under
the
constitution...
for
example,
access
to
the
law
library,
religious
services,
associational
rights,
those
sorts
of
things.
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
key
distinction
between
this
case
and
lane
and
hibbs.
and
so,
as
the
court
put
it
in
garrett,
even
with
the
undue-burden
exception,
the
statute
makes
unlawful
a
range
of
alternative
responses
that
would
be
reasonable
under
the
constitution,
but
would
fall
short
of
imposing
an
undue
burden
on
the
employer.
number
three,
as
in
garrett,
title
ii
prohibits
standards
and
criteria
that
have
a
disparate
impact
on
the
disabled,
even
though
that
obviously
wouldn't
be
enough
to
establish
a
constitutional
violation
if
the
disabled
were
a
suspect
class.
and,
again,
the
court
need
only
look
at
the
justice
department's
regulations
to
see
how
they
impose
a
disparate-impact
requirement.
and,
fourth,
again,
as
in
kimel
and
garrett,
title
ii
reverses
the
burden
of
proof.
as
the
court
held
in
garrett,
under
the
constitution,
classifications
based
on
disability
are
prima
facie--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--well,
i
think
it...
one
of
the
ways
is
the
one...
is
the
one
i
just
mentioned
a...
mentioned
a
minute
ago.
it's...
lane
was
certainly
dealing
with
rights
that
have
been
considered
by--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--the
court--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--to
be--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--well,
i--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--well,
i'm
not
sure
the
claim...
i'm
not
sure,
justice
breyer,
that
the
claim
of
the
person
who
wanted
access
to
the
courthouse
to
serve
as
a
reporter
was
necessary
to
the
result
in
lane
in
all
of
that.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i
think
that
would
be
one
way
of
understanding
it,
though
not
the
only
way.
thank
you.
