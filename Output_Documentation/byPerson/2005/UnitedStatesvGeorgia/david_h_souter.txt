mr.
bagenstos,
on
this
point,
do
we
have
any
figures
on
what...
i
guess
it's
the
rehabilitation
act
that
applies
to
the
federal
prisons...
do
we
have
any
figures
on...
you
know,
on
what
that
has
cost
in
required
accommodations?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
schaerr,
before
you
go
on,
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question
on
the
point
that
you
made...
and
you
made
it
in
the
brief...
about
the
failure
to
establish
a...
some
kind
of
a
history
of
unconstitutional
action
in
this
particular
state?
do
i
understand
you
to
claim
that
that
is
a...
that
a
record
of
some
sort
must
be
made
by
congress?
or
can
a
record
of
that
sort
be
made
in
the
courts,
in
the
course
of
litigation,
as
a
predicate
for
a
particular
lawsuit
like
this
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
congress--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
congress
normally
operates
on
a...
on
a
national
scale--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that,
i
mean,
we...
i
guess,
we
would
normally
say,
"well,
you
can
show
40
states
out
of
50
were
in
trouble.
"
"that's
probably
good
enough
to
get
you
across
the
line,
at
least.
"
but
you're
not
saying
that.
so,
are
you
saying
that
congress
has
got
to
make
the
record
with
respect
to
each
individual
state?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
it
could
be
done--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
could
be
done--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
the
litigation
of
this
case,
then.
there
could
be
a
trial
record
of
prior
violations.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
my
question
is,
where
does
the
record
have
to
be
made?
does
congress
have
to
make
it,
on
a
state-by-state
basis,
or
may
that
record
be
made
in
the
course
of
a
trial
in
a
particular
state
as
a
predicate
for
subjecting
that
state
to
liability
in
this
instance?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
congress
could
have
known
this,
whether
they
specifically
adverted
to
it,
or
not.
that
would
be
sufficient.
