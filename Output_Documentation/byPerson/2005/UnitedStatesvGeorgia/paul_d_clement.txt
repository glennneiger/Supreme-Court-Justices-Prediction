mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
title
ii
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
validly
abrogates
the
states'
sovereign
immunities
as
applied
to
the
class
of
cases
involving
the
unconstitutional
treatment
of
disabled
inmates.
that
result
follows
from
this
court's
decisions
in
nevada
against
hibbs,
and
tennessee
against
lane.
in
lane,
this
court
held
that
it
was
clear,
beyond
peradventure,
that
congress
had
an
adequate
basis
to
enact
prophylactic
legislation
to
ensure
that
individuals
with
disabilities
had
access
to
public
services.
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
this
court
surveyed
a
broad
array
of
evidence,
not
just
limited
to
the
court
access
context,
and,
indeed,
surveyed
evidence
involving
prisons,
in
particular.
as
a
result,
the
sole
remaining
question,
and
the
only
question
in
lane
on
which
this
court
applied
an
as
applied
analysis,
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
title
ii's
remedies
are
congruent
and
proportional
as
applied
to
the
particular
context;
here,
the
context
of
the
discriminatory,
inhumane,
or
otherwise
unconstitutional
treatment
of
inmates
with
disabilities.
now,
if
one
applies
the
congruence
and
proportionality
analysis
of
lane,
in
particular,
in
the
prison
context,
it
easily
passes
constitutional
muster.
for
all
of
the
factors
that
this
court
emphasized
as
making
title
ii
appropriate
in
the
court
access
context...
the
absence
of
absolute
mandates,
the
inherent
flexibility
of
the
reasonable
modification
standard,
the
fact
that
benefits
are
limited
to
otherwise
eligible
individuals,
the
defenses
for
fundamental
alterations
or
undue
burdens...
all
of
those
factors
apply
with
full
force
in
this
context.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
think
that
title
ii
is
particularly
congruent
and
proportional
in
the
prison
context
is,
the
reasonable
modification
standard,
which,
after
all,
uses
the
term
"reasonableness",
is
very
well
amenable
to
the
kind
of
turner
deference
standard
this
court
applied.
and,
of
course,
just
last
term,
this
court,
in
johnson
against
california
and
wilkins...
and
in
the
wilkinson
case,
cutter
against
wilkinson,
applied
deference
to
prison
officials
even
in
the
context
of
strict
scrutiny.
and
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--applies,
a
fortiori.
i'm
sorry,
mr.--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--chief
justice.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't...
i
don't...
i'm
not
up
here
today
saying
there's
no
prophylaxis
at
all
with
respect
to
title
ii,
but
i
think
it
is
proportional
and
congruent,
and
i
think
the
prophylactic
gap
between
what
the
constitution
protects
and
what
title
ii
protects
is
relatively
narrow
in
the
prison
context,
both
because
if
you
think
about
one
set
of
claims,
the
turner
claims,
much
of
that
deference
can
be
brought
in
under
the
reasonable
modification
standard;
and
then,
if
you
think
of
the
other
class
of
cases,
those
involving
deliberate
indifference,
i
think
in
those
class
of
cases,
this
is...
the
prison
context
is
one
of
the
rare
contexts
in
which
the
state
is
under
an
affirmative
obligation
to
provide
accommodations
to
the
medical
needs
of
inmates,
including
disabled
inmates.
and
i
think
the
fact
that
here's
a
case
where
the
constitution
requires
affirmative
accommodation
also
helps
narrow
the
prophylactic
gap.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
it
certainly
could.
i
think...
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
we
collect
at
footnote
17
of
our
reply
brief,
which
are
cases
where
the
lower
courts
have
applied
turner
style
deference
to
claims
under
the
rehabilitation
act
or
under
title
ii,
i
think
some
of
those
courts
of
appeals
have
clearly
taken
into
account
those
kind
of
budgetary
concerns.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
damages
are
an
important
aspect
of
the
remedial
scheme,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
also
point
out
that,
because
a
number
of
states
have
challenged
the
application
of
title
ii,
in
the
prison
context,
in
particular,
as
not
being
valid
commerce
clause
legislation,
it's
not
a
foregone
conclusion
that
there
would
be
injunctive
relief
available.
but
i
do
think
if
we
want
to
focus
on
the
damage--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i'm
not
sure
about
the
treble
damages,
but
certainly
compensatory
damages
would
be
available.
this
court,
of
course,
in
barnes
against
gorman,
has
already
said
that
punitive
damages
are
not
available
under
title
ii.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
compensatory
damages--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
punitive
damages
would
be
a
harder
case,
in
terms
of
proportional
incongruence.
but
this
court
has,
even
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action,
found
damages
to
be
an
appropriate
remedy
for
unconstitutional
or
unlawful
state
conduct.
take
the
bivens
cases,
for
example,
or
the
franklin
case,
in
title
ix,
and,
i
think,
if
damages
are
appropriate
where
congress
hasn't
acted,
i
think
where
congress
has
provided
for
damages,
damages
are
clearly
an
appropriate
remedy.
but,
with
respect
to
damages,
in
particular,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
prophylactic
gap
here
is
not
large,
because,
in
the
title
ix
context,
in
the
gebser
case,
this
court
has
already
said
that,
in
order
for
there
to
be
compensatory
damages,
there
needs
to
be
a
showing
of
deliberate
indifference.
and
now,
there
may
be
some
difference
between
what
"deliberate
indifference"
means
under
gebser
and
what
"deliberate
indifference"
means
under
farmer
against
brennan,
but,
whatever
that
small
gap
is,
that
certainly
seems
manageable.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
ginsburg,
we
don't
think
so.
but
one
thing
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
is
that,
although
at
the
current
time
period
all
50
states
take
federal
funds
for
their
prisons,
so
that
all
50
states
are
subject
to
the
rehabilitation
act,
that
wasn't
true
at
the
time
that
the
ada
was
passed.
and
i
think
what
that
illustrates
is
both
that
title
ii
plays
an
important
gap
filling
role
and
also
that,
for
whatever
reason,
i
think,
this
is
an
area...
prisons
taking
federal
funds...
where
the
degree
to
which
they
take
federal
funds
may
wax
and
wane
over
time.
and
so,
i
don't
think
this
is
a
situation
where
title
ii
is
purely
duplicative
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
but
the
difference
is
really
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
the
coverage,
not
in
terms
of
the
substantive
obligations
under
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--two
provisions.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
they
are,
as
to
the
states.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
right,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
we
would...
we
would
say
that
the
plra
fully
applies
to
claims
under
title
ii
and
there
is
an
exhaustion
remedy.
there
is
also,
of
course,
an
exhaustion
remedy
inherent
in
title
ii,
because,
in
order
to
get
a
reasonable
modification,
you
have
to
ask
for
the
modification
in
the
first
place.
we
also
think
that
the
plra
applies,
in
all
its
provisions,
to
title
ii
claims.
and
one
important
provision
to
keep
in
mind
is
1997e(e)...
42
u.s.c.
1997
e(e)...
which
is
a
limitations
on
the
damages
that
are
available.
and,
under
that
provision,
in
order
to
get
damages
for
emotional
or
mental
injury,
you
have
to
also
show
some
sort
of
physical
injury.
and
the
lower
courts
have
interpreted
that
to
require
at
least
the
kind
of
more
than
de
minimis
injury
you
need
under
the
eighth
amendment.
and
i
think
the
plra,
together
with
title
ii,
in
the
particular
area
of
damages,
which
is
what
justice
kennedy
has
pointed
out
is
the
particular
area
of
concern
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
is
even
a
further
narrowing
of
the
relief
that's
available
and
a
further
narrowing
of
the
prophylaxis
under
the
title
ii.
so,
i
do
think
the
plra
is
actually
something
that
actually
helps
make
sure
that
the
remedy
here
is
congruent
and
proportional.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
because
of
the
lack
of
the
commerce
clause
nexus?
is
that
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--concern,
justice
stevens?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it
was...
when
it
was
originally
enacted,
justice
stevens,
it
was
supported
by
both
the
commerce
clause
and,
of
course
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
is...
that's
true,
the
statute
generally...
and
it's
true
of
title
ii.
we
would
make...
we
would
certainly
defend
the
act
as
valid
commerce
clause
legislation.
but
i
do
think
that
is
a
much
more
difficult
argument
as
to
title
ii,
generally,
and
particularly
difficult
argument
with
respect
to
prisons.
i
think,
in
that
respect,
it's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--telling
that,
if
you
go
back
to
the
government's
brief
in
yeskey,
when
we
were
dealing
with
constitutional
challenges
to
the
application
of
title
ii
to
prisons,
the
government
focused
all
its
energy
on
defending
it
as
valid
section
5
legislation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
dealt
with
the
commerce
clause
in
a
footnote.
so,
i
think
we
certainly,
at
that
point,
were
of
the
view
that
the
section
5
authority
was
the
much
stronger
basis
to
defend
the
statute,
especially
in
the
prison
context.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
agree
with
that,
justice
stevens.
and
i
would
say,
with
respect
to...
i
mean,
again,
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you,
in
the
sense
that
we
would
be
here
defending
it
as
commerce
clause
legislation,
but
i
think
that's
a
tricky
argument.
if
it's
possible,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
before
i
say
anything
else,
i
want
to
just
clarify
that
the
scope
of
the
rehab
act
and
title
ii
is
really
coextensive.
mr.
schaerr
made
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
you
need
intentional
conduct
under
the
rehab
act.
i
think
that
was
true
for
a
while
in
the
lower
courts
with
respect
to
damages
claims.
i
think
after
this
court's
decision
in
gebser,
in
the
context
of
damages
claims,
the
lower
courts
have
generally
required
deliberate
indifference
both
in
the
rehabilitation
act
context
and
in
the
title
ii
act
context,
to
the
extent
they've
reached
the
issue.
but
with
respect
to
the
substantive
obligations,
they
really
are
identical.
and
i
do
think
that's
important,
in
a
couple
of
ways.
in
particular,
i
think
it's
worth
remembering
here
that
the
damages
remedy
in
title
ii...
and
this
is
different
than
title
i,
where
there
was
a
specific
provision
for
back-pay...
but
in
title
ii,
the
damages
remedy
is
just
an
incorporation
of
the
damages
remedy
available
under
the
rehab
act,
which,
in
turn,
incorporates
title
vi
and
title
ix
remedies.
and
those,
of
course,
are
entirely
judge-made.
and
so,
one
of
the
things
this
court
recognized
in
gebser,
in
deciding
there
had
to
be
deliberate
indifference
for
a
compensatory-damages
claim,
is,
this
court
said,
the
judge-made
nature
of
those
remedies
gives
the
court
a
particularly
free
hand
in
making
those
remedies
make
sense,
in
terms
of
the
statute,
and,
i
would
think,
a
fortiori,
in
terms
of
the
constitution.
so,
if--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
let
me
address
the
specter
of
all
these
claims
for
tv
access,
because
i
do
think
that
that's
something
that
can
be
taken
care
of
in
any
number
of
respects.
one
is,
a
sensible
application
of
turner-type
principles
to
the
reasonable-modification
standard
can
certainly
be
done
in
a
way
to
weed
out
those
claims.
i
also
think...
especially
given
justice
kennedy's
principal
concern
with
damages,
i
think
here's
an
area
where
the
plra
is
particularly
helpful,
because
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
physical
injury
you're
going
to
be
able
to
show
to
being
denied
access
to
the
tv
room.
and
since
that's
what
you
need
to
show
under
the
plra
in
order
to
recover
any
damages
for
mental
and
emotional
suffering
that
i
suppose
you
could
try
to
bring
a
claim
for
emotional
suffering
for
not
seeing
tv...
i'm
not
sure
which
way
that
would
cut...
but,
in
any
event--
[laughter]
--i
think,
in
those
contexts,
the
plra
is
the
gateway
you
need
to
some
physical
injury,
so
i
think
that's
going
to
help
weed
these
out
as
a
matter
of
damages
claims.
and
so,
i
think
that's
going
to
have
a
helpfulness,
too.
also,
i
think,
in
some...
in
some
sense,
you
can't
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
perhaps
the
reason
that
somebody's
being
denied
access
to
the
tv
room
is
because
they're
in
a
wheelchair
on
the
second
floor,
and
the
tv
room
and
the
law
library
and
the
religious
services
and
everything
else
they
need
in
the
prison
is
on
the
first
floor.
and,
in
those
contexts,
it
may
be
an
appropriate
degree
of
prophylaxis.
but
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is,
i
would
think
that
this
court
would
want
to
interpret
the
pl...
#
i'm
sorry,
would
want
to
interpret
title
ii
in
a
way
that
avoids
constitutional
problems,
rather
than
in
a
way
that
engenders
it.
and
so,
to
the
extent
the
access
to
the
tv
room
is
critical
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
i
think
the
reasonable-modification
standard
provides
plenty
of
tools
to
apply
turner-type
principles
and
ameliorate
the
constitutional
problems.
i
mean,
if
you
compared
this
case
with
cutter
against
wilkinson
from
last
term,
there
you
had
a
statutory
strict-scrutiny
standard
that
was
specifically
directed
at
the
prisons
in
one
other
context.
and,
nonetheless,
this
court
said,
"that
can
be
applied
with
turner
deference-type
principles.
"
here,
you
have
a
statute
that
applies
broadly,
and
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
very
easy
act
of
interpretation
and
constitutional
avoidance
to
say
that,
"in
the
prison
context,
we're
going
to
interpret
in
a
way
that
avoids
constitutional
difficulties.
"
if
i
could
try
to
address
just
one
or
two
specific
questions...
justice
souter,
you
asked
about
the
practical
experience
of
the
federal
government.
and,
as
we
point
out
in
our
opening
brief,
at
page
45,
it's
been
less
than
1
percent
of
our
litigation,
and
less
than
2
percent
of
our
compliance
cost.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
