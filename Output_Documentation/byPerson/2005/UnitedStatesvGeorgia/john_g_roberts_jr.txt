we'll
hear
argument
first
in

states
versus
georgia,
and

versus
georgia.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--suggesting--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--are
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--suggesting
that
the
ada
does
not
add
to
the
burdens
of
the
state
officials,
it
just
simply
tracks
what's
already
required
under
turner?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
turner,
one
of
the
considerations
that
can
be
taken
into
account
are
the
budgetary
limitations
of
state
officials.
does
that
apply
under
the
ada,
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
bagenstos.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
your
submission...
and
that's
what
i
heard
from
the
solicitor
general,
as
well...
on
the
difference
between
enforcement
and
the
substantive
right.
you're
assuring
us
that
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
that,
because
there's
no
great
difference
between
what
you
think
is
required
under
the
ada
and
what's
required
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--a
reasonable
reading
of
the
ada,
which
i
had
always
understood
to
be
a
significant
change
in...
in
terms
of
what
rights
are
available
to
the
disabled.
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
different
from
turner
against
safley,
which
talks
about
the
demands
of
the
prison
environment
and
the...
and
a
high
level
of
deference
to
prison
administrators.
do
you
think
that
approach
is,
in
fact,
consistent
with
what
congress
had
in
mind
with
the
ada?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
castanias.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
friends
on
the
other
side
say
that's
not
a
big
deal,
because
the
ada
looks
only
to
reasonable
accommodations;
you
can
take
all
those
factors
into
account;
and
presumably
the
lower
courts
would.
in
other
words,
they
say
you're
already
subject
to
most
of
these
obligations
anyway,
and
it's
just
a
little
bit
extra,
under
the
ada.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
presumably,
that's
because
the
prisoners
don't
have
a
lot
of
choice
as
to
which
accommodations
they're
going
to
select
from.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
schaerr,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
schaerr.
general
clement,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general,
when
you...
earlier,
you
told
us
that
this
doesn't
add
much
to
the
constitution,
in
turner
versus
safley,
and
then
we
hear
about
access
to
the
tv
lounge,
which
doesn't
sound
like
a
constitutional
deliberate-indifference
eighth
amendment
claim.
i
mean,
if
it's
important
to
us
how
much
of
this
applies,
how
do
we
address
that
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
in
no.
