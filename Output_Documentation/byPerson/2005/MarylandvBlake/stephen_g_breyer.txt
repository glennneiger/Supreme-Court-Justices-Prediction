justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
now
suppose...
i
don't
understand
all
these
legal
terms
here.
imagine.
[laughter]
it
may
be
close
to
the
truth.
now,
we
have
a
case,
a
hypothetical.
the
defendant
is
sitting
there,
the
police
say,
"question"?
and
he
says,
"i
want
to
see
my
lawyer.
"
and
the
policeman
says
the
following,
"that's
fine,
go
ahead,
we'll
get
him.
"
"by
the
way,
if
you
see
him,
we'll
execute
you.
"
"are
you
sure
you
don't
want
to
talk
to
us?
"
that's
plainly
unlawful,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
the
same
thing
happens,
but
what
he
says
is,
"you'd
better
talk
to
us,
or
you'll
be
executed.
"
"think
about
it.
"
equally
unlawful,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
a
minute--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--passes
while
he's
thinking
about
it.
okay?
is
it...
is
it
unlawful
now,
because
a
minute
has
passed
before
he
says
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't...
i
don't
want
legalism.
i
just
want
the
conclusion.
a
minute
has
passed
before
he
says
yes.
has
that
changed
everything,
and
it
becomes
lawful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
now
it's
15
minutes.
now
it's
30
minutes.
okay?
now,
a
court
says
30
minutes
is
the
same
as
one
minute,
"we
don't
think
the
passage
of
29
extra
minutes
made
a
difference.
"
and
what's
your
reply?
not
in
legalism.
you're
going
to
say,
"oh,
no,
the
passage
of
30
minutes,
rather
than
1
minute,
makes
all
the
difference.
"
and
i
would
like
to
know
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
that's
fine.
i'm
not...
i'm...
i
want
you
to
say
that
kind
of
thing.
you're
saying
it's
not
just
30
minutes,
it's
"also
some
other
things
happened".
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--possible.
that
definitely
cuts
in
your
favor,
unless,
of
course,
it
sounds
like
a
good
cop/bad
cop
routine.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--people--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--subjectively
true.
and
so,
i'd
simply
wonder
if
the
fact
that
it's
subjectively
true,
and
there
is
a
finding
that
the
defendant...
here,
we
have
30
minutes,
and
we
have
the
fact
that
the
other
detective
said,
"he
said
he
can't
talk
to
us.
"
"we
can't
do
anything
about
it.
"
we
have
that.
is
there
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
right.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
have
a
passage--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
going
to
the
standard,
which
is,
i
think,
the...
actually,
the
difficult
question
here,
what's
wrong...
should
you
say...
what's
wrong
with
saying...
which
is
what
i
was
pursuing...
that,
where
there
is
a
question
that's
improper,
as
there
was
here,
by
the
police,
the
only
real
question
is,
is
a
later
initiation
"the
fruit"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
say
the
state
has
to
show
it
wasn't
the
fruit.
that
would
have
the
virtue
of
making
the
law
quite
consistent
here,
as
it
is
with
fourth
amendment/fifth
amendment
cases.
that's
a
well
known
concept.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
i
understand
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there's
a
lot
of
language--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
just
simple
thing
like
this,
that
there
is
an
implication
in
what
reese
said,
that
he
listens
to
in
his
cell,
"i
guess
you'd...
he'll
want
to
talk
to
us
now,
huh?
"
the
implication
is
that
he
faces
death,
and
he'll
be
better
off
by
talking
to
them
without
a
lawyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
suppose
johns
had
said
to
the
defendant,
"mr.
blake,
i
want
to
tell
you
something.
"
"my
colleague
here
has
implied
that
you
will
be
better
off,
because
of
the
death
possibility,
in
talking
to
us
without
a
lawyer.
"
"we
want
to
tell
you,
that
isn't
true.
"
"there
is
no
way
that
you'll
be
better
off
talking
to
us
without
a
lawyer.
"
"you
will
be
at
least
equally,
from
your
point
of
view,
as
well
off
if
you
talk
to
a
lawyer.
"
now,
that
might
have
cured
it,
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
if
you're
looking...
if
you're
taking
your
standard
seriously--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
reason
that
my...
i
was
able
to
give
my
hypothetical
before--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
reason
that
you'd
have
to
say,
"you
will
not
be
better
off...
you
will
not
be
worse
off
in
respect
to
the
death
penalty,
by...
you
know,
we...
it
won't--
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"#
make
you
any
better
off
to
talk
to
the
lawyer--
"
sorry.
strike.
the
reason
that
the
policeman,
to
cure,
would
have
to
say,
"look,
it's
not
going
to
help
you,
in
respect
to
the
death
penalty,
to
talk
without
your
lawyer.
"
is
because
that
was
the
implication
of
his
question,
that
was
the
implication--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
wrongful
statement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
implication
was,
"you're
not
going
to
get
death
if
you
talk
to
us
without
a
lawyer.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
it
had
been
some
other
questions,
some
questions,
for
example,
about
the
crime,
all
you
would
have
had
to
do
was
eliminate
whatever
negative
implication
came
out
of
those
questions,
which
might
have
been
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
timely--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--maybe
you
should
modify
the
standard.
maybe
the
standard
ought
to
be
that
where
you
have
an
improper
line
of
questioning,
after
the
warning,
that
the
police
either
have
to
negative
the
implication
of
those
questions,
the
relevant
implication,
or
the
state
has
to
show
that
some
other
series
of
independent
events,
such
as
justice
kennedy
mentioned,
made
the
difference.
that
is,
caused
the
later
request
to
talk
without
a
lawyer.
and
if
they
can't
show
the
one
or
the
other,
then
they
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
fact,
or
is
it
not
fact,
law,
in
respect
to
the
following?
he's
sitting
there.
and
there
is
a
question
of
what
motivated
him.
did
it
motivate
him
totally
that
his...
this
thing
about
his
codefendant,
or
was
he
moved,
in
significant
part...
moved,
motivated...
by
the
earlier,
30-minute
earlier,
improper
questioning?
that
sounds
like
a
fact.
or
do
you
think
it's
not
a
fact?
