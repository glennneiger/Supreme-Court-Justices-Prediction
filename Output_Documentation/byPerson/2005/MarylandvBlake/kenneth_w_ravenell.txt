mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
our
position
that
to
allow
so
called
curative
measures
would
lead
to
police
abuses.
if
curative
measures
are
allowed,
intentional
coercive
violations
should
never
be
allowed
to
be
cured.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
in
fact--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--i
think
that
if
there
had
been
24
hours
that
had
passed,
then
you
would...
it
would
be
a
factor
that
you
would
consider
in
deciding
whether
the
defendant
has
initiated
the
conversation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
and--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
i
certainly
believe
that
the
support
is,
in
edwards
versus
arizona,
that
there
should
not
be
a
cure
unless
the
defendant
himself
initiates
the
contact.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
so,
i
think
there
is.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
and
if
there
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--sure.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
yes,
i
think
what
i'm...
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
what
i'm
telling
the
court
is
that
the
practice
should
be,
as
it
has
been
the
last
25
years,
that
you
do
not
allow
cures
of
edwards
versus
arizona
by
the
police
intentionally
violating
one's
rights
and
then
attempting
to
cure
it.
but,
if
this
court
finds
that
there
can
be
a
cure,
we
want
to
participate
in
what
would
be
a
proper
cure.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
of
a
violation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
i
disagree
with
your
honor
on...
for
two
reasons.
first,
i
think
that,
as
several
members
have...
certainly
have
said
so
far,
that
we
should
focus
on
whether
there
was
a
voluntary
initiation.
that
has
to
be
considered.
secondly,
i've
heard
mentioned
several
times
that
edwards
only
deals
with
badgering.
i
commit...
commend
this
court
to
illinois...
smith
versus
illinois...
and
minnick
versus
mississippi,
where
this
court
has
said
that
edwards
is
not
only
about
badgering,
but
the
court
said
it's
about
overreaching
by
the
police,
whether
it's
explicit
or
subtle.
so,
it's
not
badgering,
only.
and
when
the
petitioner
says
that
edwards
is
only
about
badgering,
this
court
has
said
that
it's
about
more
than
badgering.
it
is
whether
there
is
overreaching
by
the
police
officers
that
is
subtle,
that
is
intentional,
that
is
in
deliberate...
that
is
deliberate,
any
overreaching--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--that
causes--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--the
person--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--to
give
up
his
rights.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
no,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
that
was
not
my
answer.
my
answer
is
that...
and
i
will
tell
your
honor
that
i
will
not
change
that
position...
it
should
never
be
allowed
to
be
cured.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--the
better--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--in
my
opinion,
the
better
policy,
the
better
practice,
is
that
there
should
not
be.
now--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--if
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--if
i--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--well--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--in
my--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--in
my
20
years
of
trial
practice,
i
have
never
found
it
to
be
at
the
defendant's
best
interest
to
communicate
with
the
police
without
counsel.
i
have--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--never
found
it
to
be--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
sure.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
i'll
be
happy
to
participate
in
that
conversation.
and
this
is
how
we
believe
that
taint
can
be
cured,
if
at
all.
number
one,
you
put
the
suspect
back
in
the
position
that
he
was
in
before
the
violation
occurred.
how
do
you
do
that?
this
is
a
violation
of
a
right
to
counsel.
not
a
right
to
remain
silent;
a
right
to
counsel.
the
suspect
asked
for
counsel.
the
best
way
to
cure
it
is,
give
him
counsel.
how
else
do
you
cure
it?
you
tell
him
that
he
no
longer...
"we
were
wrong
when
we
told
you,
you
face
the
death
penalty.
"
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
"you
do
not
face
the
death
penalty.
"
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
i
don't
agree
that
i
need
another
fallback
position,
because
i
believe
that
if
the
court
finds
that
right
to
counsel...
giving
him
counsel
is
not
enough,
other
things
i'm
about
to
tell
the
court,
i
think,
will
also
be
a
factor.
for
example,
telling
the
defendant
that
he,
in
fact,
does
not
face
the
death
penalty.
very
interestingly,
this
court...
and
the
seibert
case,
in
fact,
justice
kennedy's
opinion,
said
that
one
of
the
things
you
consider
is,
when
there
is
a
violation
of
the
right
to
miranda
rights,
you
tell
the
suspect,
"that
was
an
improper
violation
of
your
right.
"
"that
statement
may
not
be
admissible--
"
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--"#
against
you".
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
we
disagree.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
interestingly,
what
your
honor
said
in
the
seibert
case
is
that
when...
and,
in
fact,
the
plurality
opinion...
when
you
give
an
alleged
cure
in
the
midst
of
the
violation,
the
defendant
misses
it.
so,
giving
this
alleged
cure
in
the
midst
of
the
violation
creates
the
problem.
what
you
need
to
do
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--i
think
that...
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--what
we
would
have--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--is
a
stronger--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--case.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
no.
i
think
the
case
would
be
proper
if
johns
did
certain
things.
one
is,
give
him
counsel.
now,
i
understand
the
court
says,
"maybe
we
won't
go
that
far.
"
but,
if
you're
not
going
to
give
him
counsel,
what
else
can
you
do?
you
can
certainly
tell
him
that
the
comment
by
officer
reese
was
improper,
"we
will
honor
your
right
to
an
attorney.
"
"what
officer
reese
said
was
wrong.
"
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
was
never
a
time
when
detective
johns
spoke
to
blake
directly
and
made
any
efforts
to
clarify,
or
even
resolve,
the
alleged...
the
violation.
in
fact,
detective--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--johns--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--says--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--no.
no.
now
that
there
is
a
violation,
you
have
to
cure
it.
you
have
to
cure
it.
and
the
only
way
to
cure
it
is
for
someone
to
speak
to
him.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
one
of
the
things--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--with
all
due
respect,
i
couldn't
disagree
more,
because
i
think
what
has
to
be
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
direct
comment
to
the
suspect
so
that
the
suspect
understands
that
this
violation
occurred,
"it
was
a
violation
of
your
right,
and
we,
the
police,
will
not
countenance
what
reese
did.
"
"and
here
is
what
we
will
do.
"
"we
will
get
you
counsel,
if
you
wish
to
have
counsel.
"
"you
are
not
facing
the
death
penalty,
young
17-year-old
sitting
in
a
cell
in
your
underwear.
"
"that
is
not
correct.
"
"here
is
what
we
can
do
for
you.
"
"we
will.
"
--in
fact,
as
this
court
suggests
in
the
plurality
opinion
and
seibert,
you
change
location.
you
change
the
interrogator.
you
give
him
time.
as
this
court
said...
in
fact,
justice
scalia's...
maybe
dicta
in
mcneil
said...
you
look
at
a
lapse
of
time.
you
consider
that
there
is
a
break
in
time.
all
of
those
factors
may
be...
if
all
of
those
things
were
done,
then
you
could
become...
begin
to
move
closer
to
putting
blake
back
in
the
position--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--that
he
was
in
before.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
and--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--i
think
that
if
that
was
done,
then
we
are
moving
in
the
right
direction.
but--
[laughter]
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
the
right
direction
would
be--
[laughter]
i
would...
i
would...
as
mr.
blake's
attorney,
i
would
have
appreciated
that.
now,
i
will
tell
the
court
that
i
believe
that
when
you
add
those
factors,
you
really
do
get
closer
to
curing
what
we
think
should
not
be
cured.
several
things
this
court
said
earlier...
and
i
think
is
correct,
from
some
of
the
members
of
the
court...
is
that
we
have
to
give
deference
to
the
trial
court's
finding.
the
government
would
have
you
pay
no
attention
to
the
trial
court's
finding
when
the
trial
court
heard
officer
reese...
in
fact,
heard
officer
reese
sit
on
the
witness
stand
and
lie
under
oath...
the
court
found
that
officer
reese
was
not
worthy
of
belief.
not
only
did
he
violate
mr.
blake's
right,
he
then
sat
on
the
witness
stand
and
lied
about
it.
now,
do
we
want
to
encourage
that
kind
of
police
abuse,
where
the
police
will
abuse
the
rights
of
someone,
then
sit
on
the
witness
stand
and
lie,
and
then
we
say...
well,
the
trial
judge,
who
had
a
chance
to
observe
the
demeanor,
to
watch
the
witnesses,
trial
judge,
judge
north,
who
is
actually
present
here,
and
who
had
a
chance
to
observe
each
witness
testify--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
i
will
ask--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--i
will
direct
the
court
to
two
cases,
salve
regina
college
versus
russell,
499
u.s.
225,
where
this
court
said
the
following,
"deferential
review
of
mixed
facts...
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact
is
warranted
where
it
appears
that
the
district
court
is
better
positioned
than
the
appellate
court
to
decide
the
issue
in
question,
or
that
probing
appellate
scrutiny
is...
will
not
contribute
to
the
clarity
of
legal
doctrine.
"
the
court
further
said,
in
miller
versus--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--i
find
that
interesting,
your
honor,
because
the
court
did
the
same
thing
elstad.
this
court,
in
fact,
gave
every
deference
to
the
trial
court's
finding
in
elstad.
so,
there's
absolutely
no
reason
why
this
court
would
not
give
the
same
deferential
treatment
to
judge
north's
decision,
when
judge
north,
just
as
the
trial
judge
in
elstad,
got
a
chance
to
observe
the
witnesses
who
testified,
and
found
that
that
violation
of
elstad's
right
was
not
intentional,
that
it
was,
kind
of,
a
good
faith
violation.
that
had
an
impact.
and,
in
fact,
in
seibert,
the
court
again
made
reference
to
that,
and,
in
justice
o'connor's
dissent,
made
reference
to
that.
so,
it
is
clear
that
this
court
has
given
deference...
clear
deference,
on
every
the...
one
of
the
cases
i've
mentioned
in
the
past,
to
a
trial
court's
finding.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
there
is
no
reason--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--to
be
different
here.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
yes,
i
am.
and
i
will
point
the
court
to
miller
versus
fenton,
478
u.s.
104,
where
this
court
said,
"equally
clear,
an
issue
does
not
lose
its
factual
character
merely
because
its
resolution
is
dispositive
of
the
ultimate
constitutional
question.
"
this
court
has
made
clear
that
you
give
deference
to
the
trial
judge's
findings,
even
if
it
may
have
an
impact
on
the
ultimate
resolution,
even
where
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
and
that's
all
we
ask
for
in
this
case.
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
when
we
consider
that...
in
this
particular
matter,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
mr.
blake
was
responding
to
the
comments
by
office
reese.
and
the
trial
court
made
that
finding.
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
that
office
reese's
comment
was
intended
to
elicit
a
response.
same
thing
this
court
has
said
in
innis.
when
you
get
to
the
next
step,
the
question
is,
what
that
interrogation?
the
trial
court
made
a
factual
finding
it
was
interrogation.
in
fact,
petitioner
concedes
it
was
interrogation.
next
step
was,
was
it
a
response,
or
was
it
new
initiation
of
a
new
conversation,
by
blake?
the
trial
court
found
that
it
was
a
response
by
mr.
blake
to
the
comments
by
officer
reese.
the
trial
court
also
made
a
finding
that
there,
in
fact,
was
no
cure.
that
factual
finding
was
given
deference
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
considered
several
things.
it
said
you
should
consider
the
attenuation.
this
court
said
you
should
consider
change
in
interrogation,
location
of
interrogation...
change
in
the
interrogator...
excuse
me...
change
in
the
location.
and
i
believe
that
we
add
the
fact
that
there
would
have
been
no
further
advice
to
the...
to
the
suspect
that
he
did
not
face
the
death
penalty.
parties
agree
here.
in
fact,
in
the
sg's,
solicitor
general's,
brief,
on
page
25,
they
say,
"if
there
has
been
any
intentional
coercive
violation,
there
should
be
not
be
a
cure.
"
the
trial
court
found
that
the
act
of
office
johns
was
intentional.
i
don't
think
anyone...
anyone,
even
under...
in...
under
any
standard
of
review...
could
find
that
officer
john...
officer

not
intentional.

of
the
sg's

i'm
reading.
"police
officers
who
engage
in
interrogation
after
a
suspect
has
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
also
run
the
risk
of
a
judicial
finding
that
any
statement
given
was
coerced.
"
as
we
have
here.
if
i
may
continue,
"in
that
event,
the
initial
statement
would
be
unusable
for
any
purpose--
"
mr.
kenneth

--which
is--

--which
is
what
we
have
in
the
trial

finding,
that
there
is...

in
fact,
it
was

the
trial

made
a

was
an
intentionally
coercive
act
by

mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.

i
disagree
that
if
there,
in
fact,
was
an
initial...
if
there
was,
in

that

in

--in
state--
mr.
kenneth

--yes.
mr.

all
right.

understand.

and
i
think
that
when
we
review
that
in
a
mixed
question
of
fact
or
law,
giving
all
deference
to
the
trial
court's
finding,
as
this
court
has
in
the
past
in
the
cases
i've
cited,
that,
in
fact,
there
is...
was
a
violation,
the
violation
was
not
cured,
and
that,
even
if
this
court
establishes
curative
measures,
those
measures
must
be
designed
to
put
the
suspect
back
in
the
position
that
he
was
in
prior
to
the
police
violation
of
his
rights.
we
think
that
it
is
a
dangerous
path
to
go
down
to
allow
the
police
to
abuse
a
suspect's
rights,
and
then
cure
it.
one
of
the
things
i
believe
we
learned
from
what
occurred
in
elstad
and
then
in
seibert
is
that...
and,
in
fact,
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
seibert,
this
court
pointed
out
that
after
elstad,
some
20-something
years,
the
police
created
policies
and
strategies
designed
to
violate
what...
the
first
question
first.
and,
in
fact,
the
plurality
opinion
pointed
out
that
not
only
did
the
police
create
that
strategy,
what
the
police,
in
fact,
started
doing
was
omitting
miranda
altogether.
and
this
court
made
reference
to
that
in
u.s.
versus
harris,
that
what
the
police
will
do,
if
you
give
them
the
opportunity,
they
will
abuse
the
rights
and
attempt
to
cure--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
sure.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
and
the
trial--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--i
agree.
and
the
trial
court
made
clear
that
she
was
considering
everything.
but
what's
important
is
that
the
trial
court
got
a
chance
to
hear
mr.
blake
testify.
the
trial
court--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--understood--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
we
do
not
dispute
that
at
all.
but
what
is
important
is
that
the
trial
judge
got
a
chance
to
assess
all
of
those
factors,
and
the
trial
judge,
even
after
assessing
those
factors,
concluded
that
what
impacted...
that
there
was
still
a
great
impact
on
him.
and
it
is
the
government's
burden--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--it
was
their
burden--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--correct.
and
that
is
what
the
trial
judge
did
in
this
case.
the
trial
judge
considered
those
factors.
and
that
is
what...
we
leave
it
to
the
judges--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--to
do.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
the
trial
court
considered
that
there
can
be
a
cure.
and,
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
said
there--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--can
be
a
cure.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
no.
and
that's
why
i
think
i...
i
hope
i've
made--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--it
clear
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
i
agree
that
i
do
not
need
this
court
to
find
that
edwards
versus
arizona
remains
untouched
for
me
to
win.
we
do
not
need
that,
because,
when
you
consider
what
the
trial
court's
finding
was,
and
the
deference
that
was
given
to
by
the
court
of
appeals,
we
win,
as
well.
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
i
think
the
better
practice
is
that
we
do
not
allow
the
police
to
go
down
this
line
of
starting
to
abuse
rights,
and
then
curing
them.
but
i'd
just--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--we
don't...
i
don't
need
that
to
win.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
i
certainly
believe
that,
from
the
teachings
of
seibert
and
from
other
cases,
that
this
court
clearly
seemed
to
be
leaning
towards
cure,
that
there
can
be
cures.
i
know
that
the
position
on
edwards
versus
arizona
remaining
intact
is
probably,
in
many
ways,
not
where
this
court
is
leaning.
i
understand
that.
but
i
certainly
also
understand
we
don't
need
to
get
to
that
extreme
position
to
win,
because
the
facts
in
this
case
are
so
clearly
in
our
favor
from
the
trial
court's
finding
that
giving
it
the...
any
deference--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
sure.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
i
think
that
the
problem
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--i
think
the
problem--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--and
i
think
that
all
those
things
are
factors
that
the
court
can
consider
in
deciding
whether
blake
voluntarily
initiated
the
contact.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
this
court,
in
elstad
and
in
seibert,
said
that
psychological
pressures,
which
are
very
similar
to
the
fruits
analysis,
can
be
considered
on
whether
there's
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
in
fact--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
and--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--that's--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--and
i
agree.
and
that's
why
i
said
earlier
that
when
we
look
at
what
innis
says...
and
i
made
reference
to
innis
earlier...
that
it's
any
comment,
any
statement,
designed
to
elicit
a
response.
the
trial
court
that
found
that
what
officer
reese
did
was
designed
to
elicit
a
response.
this
petitioner
agrees
that
it
was
interrogation;
therefore,
designed
to
elicit
a
response.
the
next
question
is,
was
it...
did
blake
respond?
the
trial
court
found,
after
hearing
blake
testify,
hearing
other
witnesses,
that
blake
was
merely...
and
i'd
say
merely,
but
very
importantly...
responding
to
what
officer
reese
said,
not
initiating
a
new
conversation,
that
it
was
a
continuous
matter
of
only
28
minutes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
which
is
what
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
and
which
is
what
the
trial
judge
did
below.
and
when
the
trial
judge
made
that
finding,
that
what
blake
was
doing
was
responding...
because
the
trial
court
is
in
that
unique
position
that
this
court
or
any
other
public
court
can
never
be
in,
which
is
listening
to
the
witnesses,
we
give
the
trial
judges
the
duty
to
hear
those
witnesses
and
to
make
judgment
calls
based
on
what
they
hear
from
those
individuals.
we--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--trust
them
with
it.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
well,
i
would
say
this.
the
trial
court
certainly
said
it
struck
her
as
a
good
cop/bad
cop
routine.
i
will
say
the
following.
if
you
do
exactly
what
detective
johns
and
officer
reese
did
in
this
case,
and
if
the
person
does
decide
to
speak
to
you...
now,
whether
you
phrase
it
the
same
way
detective
johns
did
or
not...
the
police
are
in
no
worse
off
case...
position
than
they
would
be
if
the
person
had
continued
to
sit
in
that
cell
alone
and
not
spoken.
therefore,
however
you
do
it...
and
the
police
will
always
come
up
with
a
creative
way
to
do
it,
we
know
that
from
prior
experience
and
past
experience...
they
will
always
find
a
unique
way
to
do
it.
it
may
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--be
the
same
way.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
not
if
we
prevail
on
suppression,
no.
if
we
prevail
on
suppression,
the
state
still
had
the
right
to
prosecute
mr.
blake.
when
the
state
chose
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal,
the
law
was...
no
longer
the
law--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--but
the
law
at
the
time
was
that
if
the
state
was
not
successful
on
appeal,
it
would
be
barred
from
prosecuting
mr.
blake.
but
they
were
not
barred
from
going
forward
with
their
case--
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
--at
the
time
of
suppression.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
correct.
and
i
think
that
that
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
how
the
court
rules
on
this
particular
matter,
what
the
final
result
will
be,
whether
we
go
to
trial
or
not.
i'll
be
happy
to
answer
any
other
questions.
well,
i
see
my
time's
up.
mr.
kenneth
w.
ravenell
thank
you.
