may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
can
i
interrupt
with--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
two
rather
elementary
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
issues
is
whether...
when
he
spoke
and
said,
"can
i
talk
now"?
--was
that
voluntary
or
not?
who
has
the
burden
on
whether
it
was,
or
not,
voluntary,
the
state
or
the
defendant,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
the
state
did
have
the
burden.
and
what
is
your
view
on
the
fact
that
the
trial...
the
judge
who
heard
the
evidence
said
they
had
not
met
the
burden?
what
kind
of
deference
is
owing
to
that
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--feldman,
do
you
agree
that
the
state
had
the
burden
of
proving
voluntariness
at
the
second
stage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why...
and
why
should
we
not
credit
the
finding
of
fact
by
the...
by
the
trial
judge--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--who
found
it
was
not
voluntary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
middle
level--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--said
there
was
no
edwards
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
doesn't
contribute
anything
to
the
dialogue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
just
told
me
you
agree
that
the
burden
was
on
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--state
to
prove
voluntariness.
but
i
still
haven't
heard
your
answer
to
why
we
should
not
credit
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
care--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
the
maryland
court
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--appeals
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
highest
court
in
maryland
also
credited
the
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
any
event,
we
have
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
before
us,
and
i
don't...
i
still
don't
understand.
from
your
point
of
view,
why
shouldn't
we
credit
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
disagree
with
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--finding
that...
the...
isn't
it...
aren't
we
entitled
to
give
a...
some
presumption
of
validity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
feldman--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
have
to
interrupt.
they
did
not
overlook
that
he
had
been
given
the
miranda
warning.
she
expressly
commented
on
the
fact
that
an
hour
and
17
minutes
had
lapsed
since
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--arguing
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
you
arguing
that
trial
court,
even
though
there's
agreement...
understanding
on
most
of
the
historical
facts,
is
still
in
a
better
position
to
make
the
judgment
call
as
to
whether
it
was
voluntary
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
with
a...
with
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
seem
to
have
taken
the
position
that
the
state
cannot
cure
an
edwards
violation,
which
seems
to
me
quite
different
from
the
trial
court's
ruling,
because
the
trial
court
made
a
number
of
factual
statements
that
seem
to
me
to
be
saying,
"had
these
things
been
done,
the
violation
might
have
been
a...
cured.
"
she
referred
to
the
fact
he
was
still
undressed,
still
in
a
cold
cell,
that
his
parent...
there
was
no
parent
present.
he
was
scared,
and...
he
was
scared
and
thought
he
was
facing
death.
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
logical
inference
from
the
trial
judge's
statement
is,
"had
each
of
those
things
been
different,
i
might
have
found
a
cure.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
otherwise,
why
should...
why
would
she
go
through
these
ventures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
doesn't
seem
to
me...
for
you
to
prevail,
you
have
to
take
the
extreme
position
that
there
can
never
be
a
cure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
the
trial
judge--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--said
they
did
not
cure
because
they
didn't
do
any
of
a,
b--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--c,
d,
e,
or
f.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
seems
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
really
seems
to
me
you're
adopting
quite
an
extreme
position,
because
it
does
seem
to
me
perfectly
obvious
if,
for
example,
they
got
a
lawyer
or
brought
his
parents
in,
and
they
talked
it
over
for
20
minutes
and
said,
"we
think
he
ought
to
do
it.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
could...
you
could
surely
cure
it
in
some
fairness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down,
if
you're
through?
is
it
your
understanding
that
the
trial
judge
held
that
an
edward
violation
may
not
be
cured,
or
that
she
held
that,
on
the
facts
here,
it
was
not
cured?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that,
your...
the
answer
to
your...
the
question
presented
in
your
cert
petition
really
is
answered.
we
all
agree,
it
can
be
cured.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
question
you
asked
is
whether
it
can
be
cured.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
the
trial
judge
did
assume
it
could
be
cured.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
there
could
have
been
a
cure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
