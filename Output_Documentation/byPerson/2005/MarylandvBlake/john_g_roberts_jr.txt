justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
maryland
versus
blake.
ms.
graeff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
was
no
finding
that
this
was
a
good
cop/bad
cop--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--routine,
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
ms.
graeff.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
it's
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
not
a
purely
factual--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--determination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
ravenell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
if,
instead
of
the
half
hour
or
so,
24
hours
had
passed
and
they
got
a
call
from
the
defendant,
said,
"i
want
to
talk
now"?
still,
is
that...
is
that
initiation
on
his
part?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
you
can--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
would
have
thought--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
said,
then,
24
hours
doesn't
make
a
difference.
if
there
can
never
be
a
cure,
if
there's
a
violation
because
the
question
from
reese
constitutes
interrogation,
and
you're
telling
us
there's
no
cure,
it
doesn't
matter
how
long
it
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
assuming--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--assuming
there
was
overreaching
on
the
part
of
officer
reese,
my
question
is,
is
there
any
circumstance
in
which
that
overreaching
can
be
cured?
and
i
thought
your
answer
is
that,
yes,
that
with
the
sufficient
passage
of
time,
it
can
be
cured.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
once
officer--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--once
officer
reese
made
his
comment,
there
was
no
circumstance,
even
a
week,
a
month...
relatives
come
in
and
say,
"we
think
you
ought
to
talk.
"
no
intervening
circumstance...
once
there
is
that
one
sentence
of
overreaching,
he
can
never
initiate
contact...
discussion
with--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
police.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
you
don't
want
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
don't
want
the
officer
talking
to
blake
directly.
i
thought
that
would
be
another
violation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
seems--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
me
that
it's
a
bit
much
to
say
that
the
problem
is
that
the...
he
didn't
talk
to
blake
directly,
because
that
gets
into
another
extended
dialogue
with
the
defendant
that
the
defendant
has
not
initiated.
it
seems
it's
much
better,
in
the
defendant's
presence,
to
do
what
johns
did
here,
which
is
to
rebuke
reese
for
the
interrogation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
there's
no
dispute
about
the
historical
facts
found
by
the
judge.
everybody
agrees
this
is
the
dialogue
that
took
place,
this
is
the
time
that
it
took
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
those
are
factual
questions.
it's
a
very
different
question
of
what
the
significance
of
that
is
under
the
edwards
initiation
rule.
so,
it's
not
an
issue
of
deference
to
the
trial
court
judge.
we
know
what
the
facts
are.
we're
deferring
to
those
findings
of
fact.
it's
a
question
of
what
the
legal
significance
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
to...
stop
there.
why
is
the
trial
court
better
suited
to
apply
the
edwards
rule
to
a
set
of
facts
that
we
would...
we
accept
based
on
deference
to
the
factfinder?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
is
my--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
my
understanding
of
the
maryland
law
in
effect
when
this
happened
correct
that
if
you
prevail
on
suppression,
your
client
cannot
face
charges,
no
matter
what
the
other
evidence
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
law
applies
to
this
case
at
this
time,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
ravenell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
graeff,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
no.
04-373,
maryland
versus
blake,
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
