mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
improper
question
or
comment
under
edwards
can
be
cured
if
the
police
terminate
the
questioning
and
make
it
clear
to
the
suspect
that
they
will
honor
his
decision
whether
or
not
to
talk
to
them--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--without
counsel.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
all
of
those
things
can
be
present
in
any
miranda
case,
and
are
taken
care
of
in
a
normal
miranda
analysis
as
to
whether
it
was
voluntary
or
not.
the
problem
here
is
that
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
you
could
say
that
all
of
those
voluntariness
factors
should
be
looked
at,
in
terms
of
initiation,
although
i
just
think
the
analysis
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
if
you
were
asking
whether
he
made
a
voluntary
waiver,
that
it's
the
same
voluntary...
voluntariness
analysis.
now,
in
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
you
never...
there's
never...
first
of
all,
he
had
gotten
a
miranda
warning,
initially;
and
that
was
when
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
a
lawyer.
that
was...
that
had
happened.
secondly,
whenever
there's
an
initiation
case,
you've
never
had
another
miranda
warning
before
the
initiation.
and
what
the
police
did
here--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
but
i...
still,
the...
there
has
been,
already,
an...
a
miranda
warning.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but,
still,
the
question
should
be
broken
down
into
two
parts.
the...
as
the
court
said,
in
oregon
against
bradshaw,
you
have
to...
it's
useful,
at
least,
to
separate
the
question
of
initiation,
which
is
a
more
limited
question,
from
the
broader
question
of
voluntariness
of
a
waiver--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--or
voluntariness.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
if
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
middle
level...
what...
maryland
has--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--at
the
middle
level--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
the
state
has
argued
that
actually,
given
the
procedures
in
this
case,
the
defendant
waived
his
voluntariness
claim.
but,
in
any
event,
the
state...
the
maryland
court
of
appeals--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i'd
say...
well,
two
things.
one
is,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
itself
explicitly...
specifically
said
that
it
did
not--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--voluntariness.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
not
the
midlevel--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--court,
but
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
the...
i
don't
think
so.
the
highest
court
in
maryland
said,
"we
are
not
going
to
decide
anything
about
voluntariness,
we're
only
going
to
decide
something
about
initiation.
"
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
i
don't
think...
oh,
because
i
don't...
the...
that
court
was
relying
on
a...
on
the...
on
the...
on
the
question
of
initiation.
what...
what
that
court
was
doing
was
saying,
"we're
going
to
do
a
kind
of
voluntariness
lite
here
and
take
all
the
facts
that
might
suggest
it's
not
voluntary,
and
count
them,
and
say...
well,
give...
those,
plus
whatever--
"
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--means
it's
not--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
but...
well,
i
think
that
the
trial...
what
the
trial
court...
i
think
it...
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
the
trial
court
was
not
operating
under
the
correct
standard
of
what
it
was
supposed
to...
of
what
initiation
consists
of.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
court
has
consistently
found,
in
the
miranda
context,
that
that
kind
of
broad
"fruits
analysis"
doesn't
apply
in
elstad
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--other
cases.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
because--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--because
the...
the
point
of
the
fruits
analysis
is...
has
to
do
with
the
deterrence
function
of
the
fourth
amendment,
which
is
nonexistent,
or
much,
much
reduced,
in
the
fifth
amendment
context,
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
i
think
the
edwards
rule
is
an
important,
but
limited,
rule.
and
the
point
of
the
edwards
rule
is
to
address
the
particular
problem
that's
caused
by
a
question.
it's
not
intended
to
address
all
of
the
other
problems
that
can
arise
in
connection
with
voluntary--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
problem
was
that
the
trial
court
was
not
looking
at
all
the
factors
that
you
would
normally
look
at
to
decide
voluntariness.
it
thought
that,
in
looking
at--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--initiation--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
overlooked
the
fact
that
he
had
been
given
the
miranda
warnings,
that,
as
far
as
anybody--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
well,
it's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--so
that's
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
overlooked--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
fact
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--he
knew
that
he
had
the
right
to
remain
silent,
and
that
the
particular
problem
that
had
been
caused
by
the
question--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--which
was--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
she
didn't
overlook
the
fact.
she
knew
what
the
facts
were.
but
she
overlooked
the
significance
of
that
in
the
analysis.
but,
more
importantly,
she
overlooked
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant,
at
the
time
that
he
decided,
a
half
hour
later,
that
he
wanted
to
talk
to
the
police,
the
police
had
terminated
the
earlier
questioning
and
had
made
it
clear
to
him
that
they
were
going
to
honor
his
decision
whether
or
not
to
talk
to
them
without
counsel
present.
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--those
are--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--extremely--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--we--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--we...
well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it...
she
did...
what...
she
did
not
give
the
proper
weight
to
those
facts,
which,
in
a
proper
involuntariness
analysis,
are
ones
that
are
important.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
and
that
edwards
was
designed
to
support--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--coupled--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
and
the
concern
of
edwards...
as
the
court
has
repeatedly
explained,
the
concern
of
edwards
is
that
the
court...
that
the
police
will
wear
down
or
badger
the
defendant.
but
once
there's...
if
there's
been
a--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--single
comment,
as
can
happen--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that...
i
mean,
there's
two
points
i'd
like
to
make
about
that.
one
is,
as
far
as
i
know
under
maryland
practice,
what
they
did
is
consistent
with
maryland
practice
as
part
of
what's
normally
attendant
on
taking
somebody
into
custody.
and
it's...
and
it
doesn't
count
as
questioning,
under
miranda.
and
it's
a...
it's
a
different
problem.
and,
secondly,
that
issue
of
handing
him
that
charging
document...
which
i
think
is
probably
a
sound
practice,
because
it
lets
the
defendant
know
what
he's
charged
with...
that
practice
is
one
that
can
happen
and
can
have
its
influence
on
a
defendant's
decision
whether
or
to
talk,
in
any
case,
and
should
be
considered
in
a
general
involuntariness
analysis.
but
it's
not
a
decisive
factor
in
this
case,
and
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
the
particular
concerns
of
edwards.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
they're
all--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
they're
already
under--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
they
do,
because,
under
the
court's
decision
in
bradshaw,
there's
initiation,
and
then
there's
always
a
separate
voluntariness
inquiry
to
take
care
of
those
problems.
thank
you.
