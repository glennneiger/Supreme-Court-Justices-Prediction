the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
trial
judge
made
certain
findings.
he
heard
these
witnesses.
he
heard
the
police
officers.
and
he
suggested
that
the...
police
officer
reese
was
playing
a
good
cop/bad
cop
game
with
detective
johns.
and
so,
that
this...
the
statement
made
by
reese,
"you'll
want
to
talk
to
us
now,
huh?
"
was
designed
to
elicit
an
answer.
and
the
trial
court
also
said
there
is
an
additional
factor,
and
that
is
this
charge,
that
was
intimidating
even
if
it
didn't
have
death
on
it,
wasn't
presented
to
blake
immediately.
it
could
have
been
presented
when
he
was
put
in
the
cell,
initially.
so,
there
were
those
factors.
those
are
relevant,
are
they
not,
to
the
character
of
what
blake
said?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
factors
that
i
mentioned?
would
they
be
relevant
to
a
factfinder's
determining
what
a
reasonable
person
in
that
situation...
with
the
two
police
officers
appearing,
with
the
charges
not
being
presented
immediately,
not
being
presented
at
the
time
the
miranda
warnings
were
given,
but
only
after...
would
those
be...
would
those
be
relevant
factors
to
decide
if
this
was
a
voluntary
initiated
request
to
talk
to
the
police?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i...
before
we
get
to
that,
i
read
the
trial
court's
opinion,
and
it
didn't
seem
to
me
that
it
was
playing,
as
justice
breyer
said,
this
game
of
legal
words
and
labels.
it
was
saying,
"there
are
things
to
suspect
here.
"
"yes,
i
credited
detective
johns.
"
"but
he
was
asked,
'why
did
you
bring
along
reese?
"
"you
didn't
need
him?
"
"'.
"
and
there
was
no
answer
to
that.
and
there
was
also
no
explanation,
after
they
left
blake
in
his
cell,
reese
just
having
said,
"i
bet
you
want
to
talk
to
us
now,
huh?
"
--there
was
nothing
said
to
assure
blake
that
that
was
not
a
"you'd
better
talk
to
us,
or
you're
going
to
be
in
trouble.
"
kind
of
thing.
there
was
just
the
statement
by
blake
and
another
miranda
warning.
all
of
those
things,
the
judge
said,
weighed
on
his
mind,
and
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
government
hadn't
sustained
its
burden
on
the
basis
of
those
factors.
so,
is
that
clearly
erroneous?
i
mean,
don't
we
defer
to
the
judge's
findings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
doesn't
count--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
feldman,
it
doesn't
count
as
badgering,
or
the
equivalent,
that
the
police...
the...
walk
in,
and
they
present
not
only
the
charges,
but
they
present
the
application
for
the
charges,
which
shows
that
the
co
perpetrator
had
talked
to
the
police,
talked
his
head
off,
and
put
all
the
blame,
at
every
step
on
the
way,
on
this
defendant?
that
did
weigh
heavily
in
the
trial
judge's
mind.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is...
was
that
improper
to
take
into
account?
how
would
a
reasonable
person
in
this
situation
feel?
"would
he
feel
that
he
was
impelled
to
speak,
because
the
co
perpetrator
had--
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ravenell--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
are
defending
a
judgment
that
no
court
in
maryland,
as
far
as
i
know,
ever
made.
all
of
the
courts
thought
that
the
law
was,
yes,
the
taint
of
an
improper
question
by
the
police
can
be
removed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
let's
take
the
case
as
it
comes
to
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
taint
can
be
removed.
that
is
the
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
accepting
that
to
be
the
law,
what,
in
your
judgment,
would
it
take
to
remove
the
taint
+/?
the
taint
here
being
the
statement
that
office
reese
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
think...
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
this
particular
record.
i
thought
that
the
trial
judge
put
it
rather
simply.
he
said,
"there
was
an
interrogation
by
a
police
officer
named
reese.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
conceded,
as
i
understand
it
from
maryland--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
police
asked
the
question,
and
then
the
trial
judge
said
the...
what
blake
said
was
an
answer
to
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
how
she
read
what
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
question
implying,
"you'd
better
speak
to
us",
and
there
was
an
answer
to
that
question.
not
an
initiation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
what
we're--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we're
dealing
with
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
trial
judge's
determination?
there
was
a
question.
everybody
agrees
reese...
what
reese
did
was
interrogate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
trial
judge
then
finds
there
was
an
answer
to
that
question.
is
that
a
matter
of
fact?
it
didn't
seem
that
the
trial
judge
was
treating
that
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
prosecutors
were
well
aware
of
that
when
they
determined
to
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
perhaps
they
were
worried
that
they
didn't
have
a
case
without
the
defendant's
statements.
