justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
suppose
that
if
they
knowingly
put
death
on
in
order
to
get
him
off
his
balance,
that
would
be
badgering,
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
initial
question
justice
o'connor
asked
is,
do
we
consider
these
other
factors?
and
then...
but
you're
talking
now
about
curing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
has
to
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--voluntary
at
some...
if
you
held
the
man's
hand
to
a
burning
iron,
we
would...
we'd
say
that's
not
voluntary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
it
has
to
be
voluntary,
certainly,
in
the
lay
sense
of
the
term.
then
the
law
has
certain
accretive
force
when
we
talk
about,
you
know,
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
what
we're...
what
we're
talking
about,
it
seems
to
me,
is,
rather,
a
commonsense
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
voluntary,
as
to
which
i
don't
think
you
necessarily
lose
your
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
these
have
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
it's
voluntary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i...
you
can't
initiate
something
involuntarily
and
have
that
count,
can
you?
you
say--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let's
say
involuntarily,
in
the
lay
sense
of
the
word,
in
the
common
sense
of
the
word,
where
it
was
actually
physically
coerced.
that
wouldn't
count.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
it's
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--first
part
of
the
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
first
part
of
the
analysis
is
whether
or
not
he
initiates.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you're
trying
to
tell
us
that
the
initiation
can
be
involuntarily?
i
just
don't...
i
just
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
you
have
to
concede--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
we
can--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
that's
a
given.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
he
agrees...
he
indicates
affirmatively
that
he
wants
to
begin
talking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
issue,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
fact,
there
was
a
finding
that
johns'
testimony
was
credible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
so
sure,
because
a
voluntary
waiver
is
measured
against
a
miranda
warning.
and,
by
definition
here,
you
don't
have
a
miranda
warning,
because
we're
asking
about
"whether
initiation".
so,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
threshold
inquiry
of
voluntariness
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
voluntary
initiation,
and
that
that...
it
does
not
comprehend
or
require
a
miranda
warning.
otherwise,
you're
double
counting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree
with
that.
but
i
want...
what
i
think
the
court
is
trying
to
find
is
some
explanation
of
the
threshold
test
for
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
voluntary
initiation.
now,
i
think
we
agree...
or
at
least
i
agree...
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
miranda
warnings
required.
that
doesn't
go
into
the
mix.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
any
new
miranda
warning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
that
factor--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
work
the
other
way.
you
would
be
up
here,
saying,
"oh,
he
had
24
hours.
"
"he
thought
he
was
going
to
get
the
death
penalty.
"
"he
knew
the
other
man
was
turning
on
him
to
implicate
him
in
the
murder.
"
"his
agony
was
increasing.
"
i
mean,
i...
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
curative
measures
were
adequate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
you
know,
we
can
play
the
game...
5
minutes,
20
minutes--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--30
minutes.
we
know
that.
but,
it
seems
to
me,
when
30
minutes
passed
here,
there
were
curative
measures.
now,
you
say,
at
the
outset,
there
can
never
be
a...
curative
measures.
that...
i
don't
think
you
have
anything
to...
any
support
for
that
in
the
case
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose,
again,
we
do
not
accept
that
position.
you
need
another
fallback
position
in
our...
in
order
to
argue
the
case
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
johns--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--johns,
in
effect,
did
that
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
certainly,
one
of
the
best
curative
devices
is
immediate
correction
from
a
superior.
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
you
think
you'd
have
a
stronger
case
if
johns
hadn't
corrected
reese?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--far
stretch.
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
right
direction
would
be
to
say,
"please
don't
talk
to
us".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
the
chief
justice
says
was
true
in
bradshaw
and
in
edwards
and
in
elstad.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
questions,
which
were
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact,
where
this
court
took
the
words,
took
the
facts,
and
made
a
rule.
and
that's
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--where
you're
reading
from?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the...
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
said,
"we're
going
to
look
at
this
in
the
legal
sense,
not
the
dictionary
sense.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
what
we're
reviewing
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
is
no
finding
to
support
the
suggestion
that
it
was
just
the
death
penalty
that
concerned
him.
he
was
also
concerned,
i
thought,
about
the
fact
that
his
accomplice,
tolbert,
had
implicated
him,
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--presumably
implicated
him--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--too
far.
so
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there's
just
no
finding
that
it
was
simply
the
death
penalty
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--his
concern
with
tolbert
was
a
wholly
legitimate
reason
for
him
to
want
to
talk
to
the
police
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--get
things
straightened
away
right
away.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--absent
of
good
cop/bad
cop
finding,
and
i...
and
i
repeat
that
they've
credited
johns'
testimony
here...
this
seems
to
me
a
very
odd
sort
of
interrogation,
to
say,
"no,
no,
you...
we
can't
talk
to
him
now.
"
that's
an
interrogation?
that's
a
stretch.
