ms.
graeff,
is
there
any
case
which
says
that
an
initiation
is
not
voluntary,
as
opposed
to
a
confession
being
not
voluntary,
because
the
suspect
has
been
charged
with
a
crime
greater
than
what
the
police
believe
they
can
prove,
or
if
the
police
advise
him
that
he's
been
charged
with
a
greater
crime
than
what
he's
really
been
charged
with?
is
there
any
case
which
says
that
the
effect
of
that
is
to
cause
his
initiation
of
discussion
to
be
involuntary?
justice
antonin
scalia
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--improper
statement
was,
"i
bet
you
want
to
talk
now,
huh?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--immediately,
the
other
detective,
johns...
immediately?
justice
antonin
scalia
said
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
those
facts
could
not
reasonably
be
found
to
be...
to
produce
a
situation
in
which
the
defendant
believed
he
would
be
hounded
to
talk,
so
he
said,
"what
the
heck,
i'll
talk.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what
edwards
is
directing.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
no
factfinder...
and
this
is
mixed
fact
and
law...
could
reasonably
come
to
that
conclusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
it...
when
one
of
the...
the
last
he
had
heard
from
the
officers
was,
"no,
he
doesn't
want
to
talk.
"
"he
already
asked
for
a
lawyer.
"
"we
cannot
talk
to
him
now.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
no
reasonable
judge
could
find
that
that
defendant
thought
he
would
be
hounded.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
defendant
thinks
he
is
going
to
be
hounded.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
do
with--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
defendant
thinks
he
will
be
badgered
and
badgered
until
he
finally
talks.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what
edwards
is
directed
at.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
cure--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
cure
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--sorry,
go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
cure
of
what?
that's
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me,
a
lot
of
this
discussion
has
come
down
to.
what
are
you
curing?
are
you
curing
involuntariness
of
the
confession,
or
are
you
curing
the
police
badgering?
i
thought
that
we
were
just
trying
to
cure
the
badgering
and
then
let
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
be
decided
as
voluntariness
is
normally
decided,
for
which
purpose
you
would
take
into
account
that
he's
been...
erroneously
said
he
was
charged
with
murder,
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
helping--
justice
antonin
scalia
--defendants,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
some
cases,
you
are
not
helping
defendants.
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes,
a
defendant,
after
he
talks
to
his
relatives,
might
conclude,
"boy,
you
know,
i'd
better
cooperate
with
the
police
and
get
a
lesser
sentence.
"
but
you're
saying
that
can't
happen.
once--
justice
antonin
scalia
--once
the
police
make
a
misstatement,
he
can
never
come
forward
and
say,
"i
want
to
confess".
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
quote
from
the
sg's
brief?
i
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
what
did
they
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
said
that.
i'd
be
surprised
if
they
said
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
if
there
was
a
judicial
finding
that
any
statement
given
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--coerced.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
about
the
confession
being
coerced,
that
the
statement
given
was
coerced--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
that
his
decision
to
talk
to
the
police
was
coerced.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
we're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--only
talking--
justice
antonin
scalia
--about
what
the
sg
has
conceded.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
conceded
that
if
the...
if
it
is
found
by
the
court
that
the
statement
given
was
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--coerced
statement,
in
that
event,
it
would
be
unusable
for
any
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ravenell--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let
me
tell
you
the
problem...
the
problem
i
have
in
the
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
with
your
reliance
on
the
trial
court's
findings.
i
do
not
see
how
the
fact
that
he's...
he's
there
in
the
cell
in
his
underwear,
the
fact
that
he's
17,
the
fact
that
he
thinks,
and
has
been
led
to
believe,
erroneously,
that
there's
a
death
penalty
in
the
offing,
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
that
edwards
asks,
which
is
whether
the
police,
or
this
individual,
initiated
the
conversation.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
the
issue
in
these
cases--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
the
police
initiated
the
conversation
that
produced
the
confession.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
they
go
to
whether
the
confession
he
gave
was
voluntary,
but
i
don't
see
how
they
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
he
initiated
the
conversation.
