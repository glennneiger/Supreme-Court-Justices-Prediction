then
why
consider
age?
i
mean,
the...
both
of
them
go
to
the
same
point,
and
that
is,
what
would
a
reasonable
person
suppose
the
suspect's
understanding
was
at
that
point?
and
would
it
be
fair
to
conclude
that
the
suspect
was,
in
fact,
initiating
conversation,
rather
than
responding
to
the
police
or
doing
something
irrational?
and
i
don't
see
why
the...
in
effect,
the
false
statement
about
the
death
penalty...
or
true
statement
about
the
death
penalty,
for
that
matter...
doesn't
go
to
the
same
point,
just
as
the
suspect's
age
goes
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're
making--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
what
about--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
first
step?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--aren't
you...
aren't
you
confusing
miranda,
which
is
a
question
of
comprehension
followed
by
voluntary
waiver,
with
the
question
of
initiation?
they
are
separate
questions.
and
what
our...
what
we
are
trying
to
get
at
is:
if
there
is
going
to
be
an
initiation
on
the
suspect's
part,
doesn't
it
have
to
be
a
voluntary
initiation?
your
answer
consistently
is,
did
he
know
that
questioning
would
stop?
and
those
are
two
different
issues.
one
is
understanding
miranda
warnings.
one
is
voluntarily
initiating
a
further
conversation
with
the
police.
so,
i
don't
see
it...
let's
assume
he
perfectly
understood
the
miranda
warnings.
but
if
the
initiation
was
not
a
voluntary
initiation,
or
an
initiation
at
all,
it
seems
to
me
you
lose.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
take--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
position
that
initiation
is
a
purely
formal
inquiry,
a
matter
of
magic
words?
if
he
says
the
equivalent
of,
"i
guess
i'll
talk
to
you.
"
that's
all
you
look
at?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
ask--
justice
david
h.
souter
--answer
my
question.
is
that
all
you
look
at?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're
avoiding
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
question
is,
is
the
act
of
initiation
a
purely
formal
act
on
your
view,
so
that
so
long
as
the
suspect
says
the
magic
words,
it
doesn't
matter
what
is
in
his
mind
or
what
he
understands?
is
it
formal
or
not
formal?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
formal.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
standard
fruit
analysis
is
when
you
get
something
like
a
statement,
and
that
statement
then
leads
to
further
evidence.
we're
not...
i
mean,
justice
breyer
wasn't
using
the
fruits
analysis
in
that
sense.
he
was...
he
was
getting
at
the...
at
the
same
question
we're
all
trying
to
get
at:
was
the
later
so
called
initiation
the
product
of
the
improper
police
comment
in
the
first
place,
or
was
it
voluntary?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
that.
but
you
concede...
i
think
you
concede
that
the...
that
the
so
called
initiation
has
got
to
be
a
voluntary
initiation.
you
don't
take
the
position
that
it's
merely
magic
words.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
that
is
correct,
why
do
we
not
give
some
deference
to
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
court
that
this
was
not
voluntary?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
there
was
a
legal
error.
what
exactly
was
the
legal
error?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
did
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--overlook?
what
did
it
overlook?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
always
true
in
every
edwards
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
a
wash.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
else
did--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
miss?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how--
justice
david
h.
souter
--was
it
that
she--
justice
david
h.
souter
--overlooked
that?
i
just
don't
get
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
they--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
know,
the
evidence
is
undisputed
that
one
officer
made
the
statement,
another
officer
said
no,
they
left,
30
minutes
went
by.
what
exactly
did
she
overlook?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
edwards
is
directed
at
avoiding
badgering,
but
the
issue
before
us
is
initiation.
that's
not
a
question
of
badgering,
it's
a
question
of
initiation.
and
don't
the
points
that
justice
ginsburg
raised
go
to
whether
the
initiation
is
likely
to
have
been
a
voluntary
initiation?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
your
position,
i
guess,
is...
i
think
it
is,
in
your
last
answer...
that
we
really
shouldn't
be
phrasing
the
inquiry
in
terms
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
suspect's
statement,
at
this
point.
we,
rather,
should
be
focusing
it
on
whether
the
statement
was,
in
fact,
a
spontaneous
initiation
on
his
part
or
a
response
to
the
preceding
police
statement.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
way
you
would
phrase
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--issue
for
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
lose
this
case,
can
the
defendant
be
prosecuted
federally
under
the
carjacking
statute?
