ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
edwards
versus
arizona,
this
court
held
that
a
suspect
has
a
choice,
after
invocation
of
the
right
to
counsel,
to
change
his
mind
and
initiate
further
contact
with
the
police.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
choice
should
be
taken
away,
and
a
suspect's
decision
to
speak
presumed
involuntary,
when
a
police
officer
first
makes
an
improper
comment.
the
answer
should
be
no
when
the
impropriety
is
cured.
when,
under
all
of
the
circumstances,
a
reasonable
person
in
the
suspect's
position
would
understand
that
it
was
the
suspect's
choice
whether
to
speak
or
remain
silent
and
that
the
police
would
honor
that
choice
and
stop
questioning,
a
decision
to
speak
should
be
deemed
initiation,
under
edwards.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
yes.
i
think
you
would
look
at
a
reasonable
person
in--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--the
suspect's--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--that
would
go
to
whether
the
statement
was
voluntary,
it
would
not
go
to--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--the
degree--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--no,
the--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--no,
the
purpose
of
edwards
was
to
prevent
police
badgering.
to
prevent
police
conduct
that,
conveys,
directly
or
indirectly,
that
the
police
are
going
to
continue
questioning
until
they
get
a
statement,
despite
the
invocation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
the...
the
purpose
of
edwards
was
to
prevent
police
questioning.
so,
when
a
curative
measure
conveys
that,
the
police
are
not
going
to
question
any
longer.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
the--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--and
my
answer
is
no,
that
we
do
not
consider
what...
the
death
sentence.
there's
two.
in
bradshaw--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--because
the
critical
inquiry
is
whether
the
suspect
understood
that
it
was
his
choice
and
that
the
police
would
stop
questioning.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
i
think
what...
you
look
at...
the
relevant
factors
are
the
factors
that
go
to
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
understand
that
questioning
was
going
to
stop.
this
court
has
said
that
there
were
two--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--no,
because
i
think
what
you're
looking
at
is
not
voluntariness.
you're
looking
at
knowing.
did
this
suspect
know
that
the
questioning
was
going
to
stop?
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
it's
involuntary.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
well,
i
think
that's
the
second
step
of
the
analysis.
the
first
step
of
the
analysis,
which
is
what
this
case
is...
before
the
court
is,
on
initiation.
now,
voluntariness--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--our--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--it
would
be
an
involuntary
statement
under
the
second--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--step
of
the
analysis.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
in
the
first
part
of
the--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--analysis,
our--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--yes.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
well,
what
we're
trying
to
say
is
that
the
purpose
of
edwards
was
to
prevent
badgering,
where
the
police
convey--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--well,
if
they're
twisting
their
back,
you're
not
thinking
they're
going
to
stop
questioning.
i
mean,
what
you're
looking--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--at
is,
did--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--well,
maryland's
position
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
analysis
in
elstad
and
seibert,
where
what
this
court
said
is,
you
don't
look
at
whether
something
caused
something
else,
you
look
at
whether
there
was
a
cure
in
the
sense
that
the
suspect
understood
his
rights--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--not
that
i'm
aware
of.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
what
you
look
at
as,
in
seibert,
is,
was
he--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--given
a
genuine
choice?
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
you
look
at
whether
he
understood
that
the
questioning
was
going
to
cease,
and
it
was
up
to
him--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--whether
to
speak.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
i'm
sorry.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
no.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
what
you
need
to
look
at
is
whether
an
objective
person
in
the
suspect's
position
would
understand
that
questioning
was
going
to
cease,
and
there
was...
would
be
no
more
questioning.
edwards--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--and
here,
there's
no
question
he
wanted
to--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--begin
talking.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
and
there's
no
question
here
that
he
wanted
to
begin
talking.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
involuntary.
under--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--the
second
step--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--of
the--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--analysis--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--it
would
be
involuntary--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--under
the
second--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--test.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
it
would
make
it
unlawful...
unvoluntary.
but,
again--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--with...
there's
a
two
step
process.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
no.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
actually,
our
position
is
more
detective
johns'
actions
rather
than...
the
passage
of
time
was
a
factor,
but
the
more
significant--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--thing
here--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--significantly,
detective
johns'
conduct
and
his
words,
when...
when
office
reese
made
the
improper
statement,
detective
johns
immediately
and
firmly--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--reprimanded--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--yes.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
yes.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
yes.
immediately--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--immediately
said,
"no,
he
doesn't
want
to
talk
to
us.
"
"he
already
asked
for
a
lawyer.
"
"we
cannot
talk
to
him
now--
"
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--and
pushed
him.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
no.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
in
fact--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--yes,
that
johns'
testimony
was
credible,
and
that
johns
did
not
intend
this
to
happen.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
this
was--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--we
have
that
detective
johns
then
pushed
him
out
of
the
cell--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--and
they
left.
so
the
police
initiation
was
terminated.
and--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--then
when
detective
johns
came
back,
28
minutes,
he
didn't
say
anything.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
he
didn't
ask
any
questions.
and
it
was
blake
who
initiated
and
said,
clearly,
he
wanted
to
talk
to
the
police.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
yes.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
the
state
has
the
burden
to
show
that
he
initiated.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
we
think
none,
because
the
trial
court
did
not
focus
on
the
proper
analysis.
the
trial
court
focused
on
a
causal
connection
analysis
that
this
court
has--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--rejected
in
seibert--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--if
the
inquiry
is
a...
clearly
erroneous,
yes.
but
our
position
is
that
whether
or
not
there
was
initiation
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
understand
the
questioning
was
going
to
stop.
and
so,
when
you
look
at
this
reasonable
person
analysis,
you
don't
give
deference
to
the
findings
of
the
lower
court.
and
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
there
are
no
more
questions.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
thank
you.
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
review,
this
court
said,
in
thompson
versus
keohane,
that
custody
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
and
voluntariness...
in
miller
versus
fenton...
that
voluntariness
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
and
so,
the
historical
facts
are
entitled
to
deference.
but
there
is
de
novo
review
of
the
ultimate
question
of
custody
and
voluntariness.
and,
given
the
questions
here
about
what
constitutes
a
cure,
shows
that
that
same
standard
should
apply.
it
should
be
a
legal
standard,
not
a
factual
finding.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
yes.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
well,
whether
there
was
a
cure,
and
whether
he
initiated,
it's
the
state's
position
to
be
a
mixed
of
question
of
fact
and
law.
what
was
said
is
a
historical
fact.
whether
what...
detective
johns
cured
it
and
allowed
blake
to
initiate
should
be
reviewed
de
novo.
and
with
respect
to
initiation,
it's
important
to
note
that,
in
bradshaw,
the
court
said
that
there's
a
two
part
inquiry.
you
look
at,
one,
did
the
defendant
initiate?
and,
two,
if
he
did,
that's
when
you
get
to
the
voluntariness
analysis.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
i
think
that
is
a
fact,
but,
under
seibert
and
elstad,
is
not
the
proper
analysis.
you
don't
look
at...
in
seibert
and
elstad,
the
court
did
not
look
at
whether
the
prior
unwarned
statement
caused
the
second
statement.
the
court
looked
at
whether
the
cure
effectively
advised
the
suspect
that
he
did
not
have
to
speak.
and
we're
suggesting
that
the
same
analysis
applies
in
the
edwards
context.
you
don't
look
at
whether
the
improper
comment
caused
the
initiation.
you
look
at
whether
the
cure
effectively
conveyed
that
there
would
be
no
more
questioning,
that
the
choice
was
up
to
the
suspect
and
the
police
were
going
to
honor
that
choice.
and
once
that
cure
happens
and
the
suspect
indicates
he
wants
to
speak,
there's
initiation.
and
then
the
court
can
go
on
to
the
voluntariness
analysis.
the
edwards
presumption
of
involuntariness
imposes
a
high
cost
to
the
truthseeking
function
of
a
trial,
to
society's
interest
in
having
relevant
evidence
admitted
at
trial.
and
when
the
purpose
of
edwards
is
not
served,
when
a
suspect
understands
that
questioning
will
cease,
that
high
cost
is
not
justified.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
my
reading
is,
she
found,
on
the
facts
here,
it
was
not
cured.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
well,
it
depends
what
can--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--well,
this
court
has
never
addressed...
and,
in
fact,
there
is
disagreement
here
as
to
whether
it
can
be
cured.
so,
here,
the
trial
court
did
look...
the
trial
court
really
didn't
look
at
the
analysis
in
how
you
look
at
whether--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--it's
cured--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--well,
she
looked
at...
she
looked
at...
i
guess
it's
difficult
to
understand
exactly.
she
was
looking...
she
looked
at
edwards,
she
looked
at
voluntariness,
she
talked
about
attenuation.
so,
she
did
acknowledge
that
if
it
was
six
months
later,
he
could
give
a
statement.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
yes.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
i'm
not
aware.
he
cannot
be...
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
he
can
be
prosecuted
federally.
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
in
state
court,
though.
under
maryland
law
at
the
time,
if
we
do
not
prevail
in
this
appeal,
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
by--
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
--the
state
court.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
yes.
ms.
kathryn
grill
graeff
the
statute
puts
the
state
in
a
difficult
position.
it's
been
changed
now.
but,
at
this
time,
the
prosecution
did
have
to
decide
whether
to
appeal
the
statement,
and
that
law
has
been
changed.
but
with
respect
to
blake,
he
will
not
be
able
to
be
prosecuted
if
the
state
does
not
prevail
in
this
court.
detective
johns
cured
the
impropriety
here.
he
made
it
clear
to
blake
that
there
would
be
no
more
questioning.
and
it
was
blake's
choice
whether
to
speak
or
remain
silent.
