justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
which
says
how
promptly
the
premiums
have
to
be
paid
as
it...
to...
to
make
it
analogous,
say,
to
withholding
where
you
might
have
to
pay
every
quarter
on...
by
a
certain
day?
does...
does
the
statute
regulate
when
and
how
promptly
the
premiums
must
be
paid,
or
is
that
just
all
comprehended
in
the
terms
of
the
policy
agreement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
i
meant
the
state
workmen's
comp
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
recognize
there
are
different
schemes.
the
only
one
i'm
familiar
with
is
my
former
state.
but
did
i
understand
from
your
answer
that
in
some
or
many
of
these
states,
the
employer
is
free
not
to
have
insurance?
he
can
be
self
funded?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
there
any
requirement
that
there
be
an
actual
fund
in
place
or
is
it
just
a
general
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
bond.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
there
were
letters
of
credit,
why
is
zurich
injured?
because
the
letters
of
credit
were
not
large
enough
to
cover
the
premium
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
about
the...
the
example
we
discussed,
payment
of
a
bond
premium
if
you're
self
insured?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
was...
can...
can
i...
i
still
don't
quite
understand
the
answer
to
the
bond
premium
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
no,
it
wouldn't
be
subrogated.
the
bond
premium...
the
bonding
company
says
we're
entitled
to
priority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
files
the
claim
directly
with
the
bankruptcy.
