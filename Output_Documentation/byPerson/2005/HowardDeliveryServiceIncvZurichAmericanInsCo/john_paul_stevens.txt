may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
verrilli?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i...
can
i
ask
you...
it
goes
back
to
the
first
point
your
opponent
made.
what
is
the
purpose
of
granting
the
priority?
it
seems
to
me
the
purpose
of
the
priority
is
to
increase
the
likelihood
that
the
wage
claims
will
be
paid.
and
if
you...
if
you
win,
it
won't
affect
it
one
way
or
another,
as
you
acknowledge
in
your
brief.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
priority
should
serve
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
likelihood
that
the
benefits
would
actually
flow
to
the
employee
benefit
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
talks
about
contributions
to
an
employee
benefit
plan
which
one
would
not
normally
think
of
as
paying
insurance
premiums.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
payment
of
the
premiums
doesn't
increase
the
likelihood
that
the
employees
will
get
the
benefits,
why
should
you
get
priority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
follow
up
on
the
earlier
question
of
the
chief
justice,
by
whom
do
you
understand
the
services
have
to
be
rendered
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
refer
to
the...
the
bankrupt's
employees
or
your
employees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
could
be
either.
