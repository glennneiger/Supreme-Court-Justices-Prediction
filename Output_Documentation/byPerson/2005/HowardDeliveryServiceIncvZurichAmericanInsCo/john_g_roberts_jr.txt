chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
05-128,
howard
delivery
service
v.
zurich
american
insurance
company.
mr.
strain.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
get
you
to
step
back
just...
the
presumption
that
you
began
with.
what...
what's
your
strongest
authority
for
that?
the
first
thing
you
cite
in
your
brief
is
a
dissenting
opinion
of
two
justices.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
nathanson
is
the...
you
cite
the
dissenting
opinion
for
this
proposition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
clearly
covered.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
strain.
mr.
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
an
employer
decides
to...
because
his
employees
have
had
a
good
year,
he's
going
to
put
in
a
new
parking
lot
for
them...
he...
his
plan
is
to
have
a
contact
with
a
paving
company
to
pave
the
parking
lot.
are
the
payments
under
that
contract
contributions
to
an
employee
benefit
plan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
like
the
consequence
of
your
theory
though--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but...
but
providing
for
workers'
compensation
through
insurance,
rather
than
through
self
insurance,
is
also
not
on
the
list.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
sure,
if
they
have
a
contract,
as
part
of
their...
part
of
their
contract,
they
get
the
bottled
water,
that's...
that's
easy
to
see
why
that's
covered.
but
the...
the
question
is
when
it's
not.
it's
just
something
that
the
employer
does
in
the
course
of
his
business
that
has...
that
benefits
both
his
business
and
his
workers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
couldn't
have
the
plan
without
the
bond,
just
as
here
you
wouldn't
have
a
plan
without
the
insurance
policy.
it's
just
a
different
way
of
paying
for
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
verrilli,
your...
your
friend's
argument
about
the
interrelation
between
(a)(3)
and
(a)(4)
seems
like
a
compelling
one.
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
much
of
your
case
hinges
on
the
assumption
that
congress
incorporated
the
erisa
definition
into
the
bankruptcy
code.
what...
what
is
your
strongest
evidence
for
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
verrilli.
mr.
strain,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
strain.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
