mr.
paul
farrell
strain
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
we
are
hear
about
a
bankruptcy
priority,
and
bankruptcy
priorities
must
be
clearly
granted
by
statute
or
they
are
not
granted
at
all.
that's
the
first
principle
of
bankruptcy
law
that
this
court
has
laid
down,
that
equal
priority,
that
equal
distribution
is
the
first
principle,
and
every
priority
is
a
deviation
from
that
first
principle,
and
therefore,
they
must
be
clearly
set
out
in
the
statute.
this
court
has
been
very
clear
over
and
over
on
those
bedrock
principles.
applying
them
here,
zurich
must
demonstrate
that
its
workers'
comp
insurance
policy
receivables
are
clearly
included
within
the
statutory
phrase
of
507(a)(4),
contributions
to
an
employee
benefit
plan
arising
from
services
rendered
within
180
days.
judge
niemeyer...
judge
niemeyer
followed
those
principles,
those
bedrock
principles
of
this
court.
the
two
concurring
opinions
below
did
not
follow
nor
even
mention
those
principles,
and
that
led
them
to
err,
we...
we
submit.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
the
strongest
authority
for
that,
your
honor,
is
the
opinion
in
kothe,
k,
o,
t,
h,
e,
a
1930
opinion,
followed
by
nathanson,
followed
by
embassy
restaurant,
and
it
is
the--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--no.
it
is...
nathanson...
the...
the
citation,
the
page
citation,
is
to
the
majority...
is
to
the
majority
opinion.
the
principle
is
laid
out
in
the
majority
opinion,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
nathanson
majority
opinion
relied
on
kothe,
and
nathanson
majority
opinion
was
followed
in
1959
by
this
court
in
embassy
restaurants,
and
followed
in
1968
by
this
court
in
joint
industries
board
also
dealing
with
bankruptcy
priorities.
that
is
the
bedrock
principles
in
the...
of
the
majority
decisions
of...
of
this
case...
of
this
court.
and
what
we
have
here,
your
honor
and
members
of
the
court,
is
that
a...
an
insurance
policy...
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
an
insurance
policy,
and
the
statutory
language
refers
to
an
employee
benefit
plan.
we
don't
even
have
a
plan
here.
we
have
a
policy.
there's
a
citation
in
the
zurich
brief
at
page
20
to
this
court's
opinion
in
pegram
v.
herdrich,
which
i
think
drives
that
point
home.
it
is
an
incomplete
citation.
the
omitted
language
from
the
zurich
is
as
follows.
from
page--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--it's
on
page
20,
your
honor,
of
zurich.
citing
to
page
223
from
this
court's
opinion
in
pegram,
the
omitted
language,
which
comes
in
the
middle
of
the
quotation
given
at
page
20,
is
as
follows.
thus,
when
employers
contract
with
an
hmo
to
provide
benefits
to
employees
subject
to
erisa,
the
provisions
of
documents
that
set
up
the
hmo
are
not,
as
such,
an
erisa
claim.
now,
that
is
what
our
case
is,
an
insurance
policy
that
incorporates
a
duty
to
pay
benefits
subject
to
workers'
comp
laws
of
the
different
states.
so
even
under
the
citation
in...
the
full
citation
in
pegram,
it
is
seriously
questionable
whether
this
insurance
policy
is
a
plan
at
all.
the
statute
requires
an
employee
benefit
plan.
the...
this
court
requires
that
it
be
clear
from
the
statute
that
this
insurance
policy
is
itself
a
plan.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
i
believe
that
is...
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
i
disagree
with
you,
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--to
this...
to
this
extent.
the
definition
of
employee
benefit
plan
under
erisa
is
in
two
parts,
a
section
(a),
which
is
a...
which
is
a
listing;
and
a
section
(b),
which
is
incorporation
of
provisions
of
the
taft
hartley
law.
and
it's
under
the
section
(b),
the
incorporation
of
provisions
of
the
taft
hartley
law,
that
workers'
compensation
comes
in.
and,
of
course
it
is
then
excluded
by...
by
erisa.
but
a...
the
erisa
definition
does
not
demonstrate
that
a...
an
insurance
policy
is
a
plan.
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
issue
under
erisa
of
whether
everything
scheduled
in
erisa
is
a
plan
or
not.
in
the
massachusetts
v.
morash
decision,
this
court
determined
whether
a
vacation...
unpaid
vacation
policy
was
a
plan
under
the
definition
of
erisa,
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
not.
so
it
is
clear
from
this
court's
precedent
that
whether
or
not
something
is
listed
in
erisa,
even
if
it
applied...
in
that
case,
erisa
applied;
in
this
case
it
does
not...
even
if
it
applied,
would
not
qualify
as
a
plan.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
the
employer
can
be
self
insured
for
workers'--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--i
think
it
would
not,
your
honor,
because
the
self
insurance
for
workers'
comp,
as
i
understand
them,
what
they
normally
do
is,
just
as
the
court
referred
to
in
that
omitted
section
of
the
pegram
opinion,
is
it
simply
is...
is
an
agreement
that
it
will
provide
the
necessary
wherewithal
and
bonding
to
pay
the
benefits
as
specified,
as
they
may
change
from
time
to
time
in
a
state
statute.
there
is
none
of
the
other
things,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
court
dealt
with
in
pegram
which
would
make
it
a
plan
that
are
present
in
either
a
workers'
compensation
insurance
policy
or
a
self
insurance
program,
as
is
permitted
and--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--it
would
be,
your
honor,
or
in
the
case
of
our
case,
an
employee
benefit
policy.
and
i
would
like
to
pick
up
on
that,
if
i
may,
because
it
is
not--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
good
way
to
do
that,
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
anomalies
in
trying
to
superimpose
an
insurance
policy
under
the
rubric
of
an
employee
benefit
plan.
now,
premiums...
premiums,
of
course,
there
is
a...
there
is
a
mechanism--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--and
there
is
a
mechanism
in
the
policy
to
determine
the
payment
of
premiums.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
it
is
not
understanding...
and
i
may
be
mistaken
because
this
policy
was
not
placed
in
the
record
by
zurich.
it
is
not
my
understanding
that
that
is
how
the
policy
premium
calculations
are
made,
your
honor.
now--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--certainly,
justice
souter,
you
may
be
right,
but
we've
checked
the
proof
of
claim
filed
by
zurich
which
started
this
off,
and
they
did
not
attach
the
workers'
compensation
insurance
policy
to
it.
so
it
is
not
in
the
record,
and
i
simply
don't
know--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--well,
i...
i
will
not
say
that
it's
not
an
issue,
your
honor.
it
is...
it
is
an
issue--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--well--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--and...
and
i...
i
think
that,
as...
as
i
hope
may
blend
the
answers
to
both
questions.
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--i...
i
think
that
is...
i
think
that
is
where
we...
where
we
are.
we
have
a
policy
that
was
not
placed
in
the
record
by
the
applicant
for
this
priority.
we
have
our
general
knowledge
of
what
workers'
comp
insurance
policies
are.
we
have
a
statutory
requirement
which
reads,
a
calculation
with
180
days,
which
i
suggest
is
an
anomaly
when
we
compare
it
to
the
statutory
language.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
well...
well,
certainly
the
priority
statute
does
not
because
the
priority
statute
doesn't--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--the
state
workers'...
workers'
comp
law.
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
know
the
answer.
i
know
that
the
state
laws...
i
know
that
the
state
laws
vary,
and
we
have
10
different
workers'
comp
laws
that
allude
to
or
mention
workers'
comp
insurance
policies
present
just
in
this
case.
so
it
may
be
that
those
statutes
might
provide
some
of
the
basis
for
an
explanation,
but
i
simply
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
did
want
to--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
in
our
view...
in
our
view,
your
honor...
i...
if...
if
i
may,
i
think
that
the
hypothetical
you
pose
is
not
quite
our
case.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
it...
it--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--your
honor,
i...
i
think
the...
the
focus
of
the
answer
should
be
on
whether
it
is
an
employee
benefit
or
not.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
yes.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
no,
no.
no,
i--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--i
understand
it,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
i...
i
think
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
i
think--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--all
right.
and
now
i
see...
now
i
see,
justice
breyer,
i
did
misunderstand...
misunderstand
the
facts.
those
facts
clearly
are
covered.
they're...
they're
covered
under--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--your
honor,
i
think
the
difference
are...
are
several.
number
one
is
what
the
employer
is
doing
here
is
insuring
itself
against
a
claim
that
would
otherwise
be
against
the
insurer.
that
was
not
in
your
hypothetical,
your
honor.
that
makes
what
we
have
here
a
policy
for
an
employer
benefit.
it
is
not
an
employee
benefit.
now,
the...
the
employer
is
the
insured.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
and--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--that
would
be
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
and
that
would
not
be
covered,
and
that
would
not
be
covered
in
great
part
because
it
is
an
employer
benefit,
employer
choice,
employer
benefit.
and
what
we
have
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--no.
your
honor,
what...
what
i'm
saying
is
and
what
we
have
here,
if
what
you're
describing,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
is
a
normal
fringe
benefit.
that
is,
an
employer
agrees
to
take
out
a...
to
contribute
to
a
pension
fund
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees.
that
is
clearly
covered.
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
dealt
with
in
embassy
restaurant
and
the
joint
industries
board
that
(a)(4)
was
intended
to
supplant
or
overrule.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
your
honor,
i
answered
that
because,
as
justice
scalia
changed
the
hypothetical,
it
was
not
an
employee
benefit.
it
was
the
employer
insuring
itself,
buying
an
annuity
or,
like
we
have
here,
insuring
itself,
so
it...
so
it
could
make
the
payments.
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
is
a
situation
where,
as
is
admitted
in
the
record,
the
employees
don't
benefit
at
all.
as
zurich
has
admitted
in
this
record
at
page
17,
the
employees
are
in
the
same
position
whether
there
is
insurance
or
no
insurance.
in
fact,
the
irony
here
is
that
if
zurich
prevails,
not
only
do
the
employees
not
benefit,
they
are
harmed
because
there
are
in
the
(a)(4)...
the
(a)(4)
priority
claimants
are
a
total
of
1.6
million,
including
the
400,000
of
zurich.
all
the
others
are
health
and
welfare
funds
such
as
justice
breyer
was...
was
posing.
zurich
is
not.
but
what
happens...
and
there's
not
enough
money
to
pay
everyone.
what
happens
is
if
the
zurich
insurance
company
receivable
gets
an
equal
priority
with
the
health
and
welfare
funds,
then
there
is
a
dilution
of
the
money
going
for
the
employees'
health
and
welfare
and
pension,
a
25
percent,
in
this
case,
dilution
of
that
money
because
the
employer
chose
to
insure
itself
for
its
liability,
potential
liability,
to
the
employees.
the
employer
benefitted
from
that
insurance.
in
some
states,
it
would
be
required
to
have
the
insurance.
in
most
states,
it
has
the
option
of
having
insurance
or
not.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
it
would...
they
would
typically...
in
a
multi
employer
plan,
as
many
of
our
priority
claimants
are
here,
because
the
money
is
spread,
the
employees
still
get
some
money.
but
if
we
consider
the
greater
whole,
the
money,
the
available
res,
the
available
pot,
to
play
those...
pay
those
employees
is
diminished.
so--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--well,
your
honor,
there
certainly
is...
there
certainly
are...
in
most
states
at
least,
there
certainly
are
funds
that
step
in
if
a
workers'
comp
insurer
or
an
employer
does
not
make...
is
not
available
to
pay
an
award
to
a
workers'
comp
injured...
a
worker
who
was
injured
on
the
job.
on
the
other...
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor,
whether
such
funds
exist
to
step
in
and
supplant
the
payments
not
made
to...
in
the
ordinary
health
and
welfare
and
pension
context,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
yes.
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
in...
in--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--well,
there
is...
there
is...
it
is
a...
a
traditional
self
insurance
with
the
overlay.
that
is,
there...
there
must...
there
must
be
a
showing
of
the
wherewithal,
but
with
the
additional
overlay,
in
all
or
virtually
every
state
which
permits
this,
of
the
requirement
of
a
bond.
and
that's--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--which
is
an
interesting
point
because
if
zurich
prevails,
we
have
the...
the
camel's
nose
is
under
the
tent
because
in
all
the
self
insurance
contexts,
the
bond
issuer
will
have
an
equivalent
claim
to
zurich.
under
their
broad
reasoning
or
broad
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
should
be
considered
narrowly...
under
the
broad
interpretation
they
want,
that
camel's
nose
would
be
under
the
tent,
and
the
bond
issuer
would
have
an
equivalent
claim
to
zurich
on
its
policy.
to
extend
that
a
little
further,
what
zurich
did
here...
was
an
insurance
company...
it
required
letters
of
credit
of
howard
delivery,
the
debtor,
to
issue
its
policies.
it
drew
down
those
letters
of
credit
$1.1
million.
f&m
bank,
the
letter
of
credit
issuer,
of
course
sought
security
from
the
debtor,
but
not
enough.
as
is
commonly
the
situation
once
the
liquidation
is
finished,
there
wasn't
enough
security.
so
f&m,
which
had
facilitated
zurich's
workers'
compensation
insurance
by
its
letters...
letters
of
credit,
would
have
an
equivalent
claim
to
zurich
as
well.
so
more
and
more
of
the
camel
is
going
under
the
tent.
this
is
a
very
broad
interpretation
with
major
implications
that
they
seek
and
it
is
completely
inappropriate
under
the
bedrock
principles
of
approaches
to
priorities
under
bankruptcy
law.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
they...
they
were
not,
your
honor.
they
were
not.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
it...
i
haven't
mentioned
it.
i'll
take
this
opportunity
to
mention
it,
justice
ginsburg,
because
it
is
a
very
important
point.
we
know
that
in
the
statute...
(a)(4)
we're
talking
about...
section
(a)(3)...
these
are
numberings
before
2005
amendment
to
the
act.
the
language
stayed
the
same.
the
numbers
were...
are
different.
but
there
are
two
that
work
together.
the
(a)(3)
priority
for
wages
for
the
employees
and
the--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--section
(a)(3),
your
honor.
i'll
refer
you,
if
i
may,
to
the
brief
of
amicus
at
page
11,
and
that's
why
i
mentioned,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
new
numbering
because
the
numbering
in
the
amicus
brief
is
using
the
2005
numbering
in
the
revised
statute.
and
what
is
listed
there
as
(a)(4)
is
the
wages
priority,
and
at
the
next

is
the
priority
that
we're
talking
about
as...
as
(a)(4).
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
i
agree.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
i...
i
certainly
recognize
that,
your
honor.
the...
the
provision
of
(a)(3)
and
(a)(4)...
they
work
in
tandem
to
protect
the
workers.
they
share
a
cap.
the
more
a
worker
benefits
from
a
wage
priority,
the
less
the
worker
benefits
from
the...
from
the
employee
benefit
plan
priority.
and
so
they
work
together;
they
work
in
tandem,
which
gives
meaning
to
(a)(4)
under
many
of
the
canons
of
construction
that...
that
we're
familiar
with.
it
would
not
work...
it's
an
anomaly
that
an
insurance
company
receivable
would
share
the
cap
with
the
wages
priority.
that
is
simply
an
anomaly.
and
when
we
look
to
the
legislative
history,
it
is
absolutely
clear,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
of
the
judicial...
the
statutory
mandate
for
workers'
compensation
insurance
is
very
important
because
what
is
spoken
about,
as
judge
niemeyer
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
below...
what
is
spoken
about
in
the
legislative
history
over
and
over
again
is
a
wage
substitute
or
a
wage
surrogate
that
employers
do
not
give...
will
lower
the
wages
but
provide
fringe
benefits.
so
the
package
remains
the
same.
now,
that's
not
a
workers'
compensation
insurance
policy,
but
that
is
the
wage
surrogates
that
the
congress
was
looking
at.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
would
answer
from...
in
part
from
the
legislative
history.
some
of
the
things
discussed
were
joint
apprentices
and
training
programs,
by
way
of
example,
as
new
forms
of
fringe
benefits
that
some
of
the
witnesses
wished
to
see
to
ensure
would
be
covered.
i
think
that
sort
of
thing
could
be
covered
under...
under
this
language
as
well.
we
know
from
the
legislative
history...
we
know
from
the
legislative
history
that
there
was
absolutely
no
intention
to
incorporate
the
definition
of
erisa,
and
we
know
from
this
court's
teaching
in
the
decision
in
united
states
v.
c&f
fabrication
just
10
years
ago
that
it
is
absolutely
inappropriate
to
incorporate
into
the
bankruptcy
statute
an
erisa
definition
where
congress
does
not
provide.
that's
an
absolute
square
holding
of
this
court
that
exactly
should
lead
to
rejection
of
the
effort
by
zurich
to
incorporate...
to
ask
the
court
to
engraft
onto
this
statute
a...
a
definition
from
another
statute.
if
there
are
no
questions
at...
additional
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
court
10
years
ago
in
united
states
v.
reorganized
cf&i
provided
that...
i
suggest,
that
the
engrafting
of
the
erisa
definition
into
this
bankruptcy
statute
was
improper.
almost
word
for
word
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
find
about
this
engrafting
of
the
erisa
definition
into
the
statute
is
dealt
with
in
plain
language
in
this
supreme
court
decision.
it
is
simply
improper
to
do
that,
and
yet,
that
is
the
answer
given
by
zurich
to
the
many
probing
hypotheticals
about
parking
lots
and
bottled
water
and
the
rest.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
what
we
look
to,
justice
breyer,
first
of
all,
is
whether
it
is
a
true
wage
substitute
rather
than
a
policy
to
take
care
of
a
nonnegotiable
statutory
requirement
that's--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--that
would
be
one
significant
factor
to
consider,
your
honor.
there
are
certainly
others,
but
that
would
be
one
significant
factor
to
consider.
that
is
true.
and
i...
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
when
we
look
to
the
legislative
history,
as
the
questions
were
asked
about
the
legislative
history,
it
is
the
void
of
any
reference
to
the
commission
that
recommended
the
law,
the
house
report
or
the
senate
report,
or
even
one
stray
congressperson
suggesting
that
workers'
comp
insurance
policies
should
get
a
priority.
not
one.
the
industry
didn't
even
put
up
a
representative
to
make
that
suggestion
at
a
hearing.
it
is
devoid
of
any
support
for
putting
this
nose
under
the
tent
in
the
way
they
suggest,
and
it
truly
is
a
broadening.
it
is
not
subrogation.
the
bondholder
would
not
have
a
subrogated
claim.
f&m
bank
would
not
have
a
subrogated
claim.
they
would
have
a
claim,
a
direct
claim,
just
as
zurich
does
here.
and
i
think
that
the
issue
we
come
back
to...
and
i'm
glad
my
brother
ended
with
that
as
well
because
that's
where
we
began.
the
issue
is
what
is
the
court's
proper
approach
to
this
attempt
to
enlarge
the
priority
under
subsection
(a)(4).
it
is
not
correct
that
this
court
departs
from
the
idea
that
priorities
are
a
deviation
from
the
bedrock
principle
of
equality
of...
equality
of
distribution.
that
remains
good
law,
cited
by
this
court
a
number
of
times.
the
cases
they
purportedly
cite
to
the
contrary
were
plain
language
cases,
were
embassy
restaurant
and
joint
industries
board.
this
court
didn't
even
feel
necessary
to
cite
that
principle
because
of
the...
because
of
the
plain
language.
where
is
the
plain
language
establishing
clearly,
as
this
court
requires,
that
this
is
a
plan?
where
is
the
plain
language
establishing
clearly
that
this
is
an
employee
benefit?
the
insurance
policy.
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
not
the
workers'
compensation
statute.
the
insurance
policy
may
benefit
the
employer.
the
statute
may
benefit
the
employee.
but
we
are
talking
about
contributions
to
an
employee
benefit
plan.
zurich's
insurance
policy
is
neither.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
concludes
my
argument.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
thank
you.
