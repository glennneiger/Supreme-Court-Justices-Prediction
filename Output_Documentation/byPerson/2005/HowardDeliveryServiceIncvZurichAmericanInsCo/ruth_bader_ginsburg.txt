would
it...
would
it
if
the
employer
were
self
insured?
can
you
be
self
insured
for
workers'
comp?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
be
a
plan
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
would
be
an
employee
benefit
program,
but
not
a
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
did--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
did
you
answer
justice
scalia's
question
as
you
did?
that
is
also
an
employee
benefit,
that
is,
vacation,
sickness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there's
also,
isn't
there,
the
pension
benefit...
even
if
there's
no
money
in
the
till
for
the
plan,
isn't
there
a
government
fund
so
that
the
worker
would
receive
the
benefit
in
any
event
if...
i
don't
see
the
distinction
that
you're
making
based
on
whether
the
worker
would
get
a
benefit
whether
or
not
the
employer
made
the
contribution.
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
strain--
--mr.
strain,
you...
you
mentioned--
--in...
in
your
brief,
you
seem
to
put
considerable
stress
on
something
that
i
haven't
heard
you
say
one
word
about
so
far,
and
that
is
that
these...
workers'
compensation
is
state
mandated.
they're
not
negotiated
or
even
employer
determined
benefits.
they
are
whatever
the
law
prescribes.
and
you
haven't...
haven't
mentioned
that,
so
i'm
wondering
where
that
fits
into
your
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
verrilli,
there's
no
employer
or
employee,
for
that
matter,
who's
doing
the
planning.
the
planning
is
all
done
by
the
government--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
what's
covered
is
prescribed
by
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
it
is
not
negotiable.
we
think
of
a
health
plan,
a
retirement
plan.
that
doesn't
have
to
be
any
set
coverage.
it's
negotiated
or
the
employer,
if
it's
not
a
collective
bargaining
situation,
determines
what
the
benefits
will
be.
here,
the
law
determines
what
the
benefits
will
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
one
feature
of
this
that
is...
does
make
it
different,
at
least
one,
and
that
is
this
is
a
benefit
to
the
employer
in
the
way
that
the
others
are
not.
the
employer...
there's
a
tradeoff
in
workers'
compensation.
it's
not
just
i'm
going
to
pay
benefits
when
the
person
is
injured,
but
i'm
going
to
get
off
the
hook
for
the
tort
liability
that
i
might
otherwise
have.
and
in
the
other
cases
of
the
other
benefits,
there
is
no...
no
such
tradeoff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
verrilli,
before--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
detract
you
just
for
a
moment?
on...
on
a
question
of
the
statutory
history,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
originally,
1934,
the
kind
of
claim
that
you
have
would
be
a
seventh
priority
claim.
and
then
in
'38,
congress
said
no
priority
at
all
covering
workers'
compensation.
and
then
when
congress
restored
a
priority,
it
ratcheted
it
up
to
four
or
five,
depending
upon
which
version
of
the
statute
we
use.
is
there
any
explanation
why,
when
congress
originally
assigned
first
a
very
low
priority
and
then
no
priority,
suddenly
it
gets
up
to
be
on
a
par
with
the
fringe
benefits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is...
what
is
unemployment
compensation?
those
two
i
think
of
as
those
are
law
mandated
coverage
that
every
employer
must
have,
workers'
comp
and
unemployment.
if
there
was
unemployment,
is
that
a
plan
too?

ruth

the
first
case
is
howard
delivery
service
against
zurich
american
insurance
company,
no.
06-128.
the
bankruptcy
code,
section
507(a)(5),
affords
priority
status
to
providers
of
employee
benefit
plans,
allowing
them
to
recover
ahead
of
other
creditors
amounts
owed
to
them
by
bankrupt
employers.
pension
plans
and
group
health
and
life-insurance
plans
unquestionably
qualify
as
employee
benefit
plans
for
bankruptcy
priority
purposes.
providers
of
other
insurance
an
employer
might
purchase
--
for
example,
fire,
theft
and
motor-vehicle
liability
insurance
--
gain
no
priority
in
bankruptcy.
the
question
presented
in
this
case:
is
worker’s
compensation
insurance
more
appropriately
classified
with
group
pension
and
health
benefit
plans,
which
receive
priority
status,
or
with
other
types
of
liability
insurance,
which
do
not?
the
petitioner,
howard
delivery
service,
contracted
with
respondent
zurich
american
insurance
company
for
workers’
compensation
coverage.
this
insurance
guaranteed
that
howard’s
employees
would
receive
health,
disability
and
death
benefits
in
the
event
of
on-the-job
accidents.
when
howard
went
bankrupt
in
2002,
it
owed
zurich
some
$400,000.00
for
unpaid
insurance
premiums.
zurich
filed
a
claim
with
the
bankruptcy
court,
asserting
that
these
unpaid
premiums
qualified
for
the
priority
status
accorded
contributions
to
an
employee
benefit
plan.
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
district
court
rejected
zurich’s
claim
to
be
bracketed
with
group
pension
and
health
plans,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit,
2
to
1,
held
that
worker’s
compensation
carriers
shared
the
priority
accorded
those
plans.
we
now
reverse
the
courts
of
appeals’
judgment.
the
case
turns,
the
court’s
opinion
explains,
on
the
essential
character
of
workers’
compensation
regimes.
under
those
systems,
workers
generally
cannot
sue
their
employers,
even
when
the
employer
is
clearly
at
fault
for
a
workplace
accident;
instead,
the
employee
collects
a
preset
amount
for
the
specific
type
of
injury
incurred.
the
employer
is
thus
shielded
from
personal-injury
suits
that
might
yield
damages
many
times
higher
than
the
amount
payable
under
workers’
compensation
schedules.
at
the
same
time,
workers’
compensation
laws
benefit
workers
by
assuring
that
they
will
receive
some
compensation
for
all
work-related
injuries,
whether
or
not
negligence
of
the
employer
contributed
to
the
injury
and
without
hazarding
the
uncertainties
of
litigation.
in
short,
workers’
compensation
arrangements
benefit
both
employee
and
employer
and
insure
the
employer.
in
contrast,
typical
fringe
benefits,
in
particular,
pension
and
health
plans,
directly
benefit
and
insure
employees
only.
further
desisting
workers’
compensation
arrangements
from
bargained-for
or
employer-
volunteered
fringe
benefits
nearly
all
states
have
loss
requiring
employers
to
maintain
workers’
compensation
coverage.
recognizing
that
the
question
is
close,
we
assign
weight
to
the
dominant
aim
of
the
bankruptcy
code
to
secure
an
equal
distribution
of
the
debtors’
assets
among
creditors.
this
aim
is
best
served
by
tightly
construing
provisions
that
give
priority
status
to
certain
classes
of
creditors.
priority
for
the
unpaid
premiums
owed
to
a
compensation
carrier
would
mean
that
other
creditors
would
receive
less
or
even
nothing
at
all.
training
on
this
case,
priority
status
for
workers’
compensation
carriers
could
shrink
the
amount
available
for
payments
owed
to
plans
that
clearly
qualify
for
preferential
treatment,
here
group
pension
and
health
benefit
plans.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
unless
and
until
congress
otherwise
directs,
claims
for
unpaid
workers’
compensation
premiums
do
not
qualify
for
priority
status
under
section
507(a)(5)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
judgment
reversing
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
stevens,
scalia,
thomas
and
breyer;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
