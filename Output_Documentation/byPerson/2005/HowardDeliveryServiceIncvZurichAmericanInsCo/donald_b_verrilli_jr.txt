mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
at
the
outset
on
exactly
what
a
workers'
compensation
plan
provides.
a
workers'
compensation
plan
provides
health
insurance
that
pays
for
the
medical
costs
of
a
workplace
accident,
disability
insurance--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i'd
be
happy
to
go
right
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
plan,
justice
scalia,
because
i
think
it's
indisputably
a
plan
under
this...
under
the
dictionary
definition,
ordinary
meaning
of
plan,
this
court's
interpretation
of
it
in
pegram,
under
erisa,
under
the
department
of
labor's
interpretation
of
it,
and
under
plain
common
sense.
a
plan
is
an
arrangement
or
program
or
scheme,
as
pegram
said,
to...
established
by
an
employer
or
an
employee
organization
to
secure
the
provision
of
benefits
to
an
employee
through
insurance
or
otherwise.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
see,
i...
i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
there
is
a
plan
for
this
reason,
justice
ginsburg.
the...
what
the
law
prescribes
is
that
which
the
employer
must
provide
to
the
employees.
but
it's
not
a
self
executing
law.
the...
the
employer
has
got
to
make
arrangements
to
ensure
that
the
benefits
are
provided,
and
under
the
laws
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
states,
the
employer
has
options
for
doing
that.
the
employer
can
contract
with
an
insurance
company
to
do
it.
the
employer
can
self
insure
to
do
it.
and
by
the
way,
justice
kennedy,
there
are
quite
stringent
requirements
for
fiscal
solvency
and
there
is
a
surety
bond
that
needs
to
be
posted
in
order
to...
in
order
to
self
insure.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
agree
that
that
aspect
of
the
arrangement
is
not
negotiated,
but
there
is
nonetheless
an
arrangement
that
secures
and
guarantees
the
provisions
of
the
benefits,
and
that's
the
plan.
there
are
steps
that
the
employer
has
to
take
to
secure
the
provision
of
the
benefits,
here
through
the
purchase
of
insurance,
and
that
is
the
plan.
the
plan
is
the
arrangement
to
secure
the
provision
of
benefits.
certainly
they
are--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
i
mean,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
those
are...
that's
a
benefit
provided
to
employees,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
there's
a
limiting
principle
here
and
i
think
the
limiting
principle
is
to
look
to
erisa.
erisa
has
a
set
of...
it
defines
what
employee
benefits
are
for
erisa
purposes,
and
it's
not...
and
it's
not
these
benefits
and
similar
things.
it's
an
exhaustive
list
of
benefits.
the
parking
lot
isn't
on
the
list.
similarly,
a
break
room
wouldn't
be
on
the
list.
none
of
those
things
are
on
the
list,
and
therefore,
i
think
by
reference
to
erisa,
one
can
relatively
easily
exclude
those--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
both
of
them
are
on
the
list
actually,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
both
of
those
are
programs
or
arrangements
to
secure
the
provision
of
benefits,
and
one
is
through
insurance
and
the
other
through
self...
insurance.
so
i
think
they're
plans
in
both
instances.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
because
the
amounts
that
zurich
is
seeking
in
premiums
are
the
amounts
that
were
due
for
providing
coverage
during
the
180
days
before
howard
ceased
operations,
and
the
reason
that
arises
from...
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
ways
in
which
that
could
arise
from
services
rendered.
it
can
arise
from
services
rendered
to
the
employees
in
the
following
sense.
howard
has
the
obligation
to
provide
those
benefits
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
employees
are
working
for
it
during
that
period
of
time.
that's
what
judge
king
said
in
his
opinion
in
the
fourth
circuit,
and
that
seems
to
me
exactly
right.
alternatively...
alternatively,
as
other
courts
have
suggested,
the...
the
services
rendered--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
appreciate
that,
justice
scalia,
but
i
do
think
the...
the
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
keep
paying
that
premiums
during
that
period
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
employees
are
continuing
to
work
during
that
period.
and
what
the...
and
what
the
insurance
company
is
seeking
to
recover
is
merely
the
cost
of
providing
the
insurance
during
that
period
of
180
days
which
arises--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
an
important
point,
justice
souter,
and
i
would
like
to
focus
on
that
and
i...
i
hope
correct
something
that
the
petitioners
said.
with
respect...
it
all
depends
on
when
the
insurance
policy
cancels.
if
there's
nonpayment
of
premiums,
then
the
insurance
company
has
the
right
to
cancel
the
policy,
and
there
has...
there's
a
notice
provision,
10
days
in
some
jurisdictions,
up
to
30
days
in
others.
but
they
have
a
right
to
cancel
the
policy.
if
an
injury
occurs
before
cancellation,
that
injury
is
covered
and
it's
covered
for
all
time,
even
if
the
policy
subsequently
cancels.
but
the
key
thing
here,
i
think,
the
critical
point
is
that
without
the
priority,
the...
the
insurance
company
is
going
to
look
at
the
situation
and
say,
we
have
very
little
prospect
of
recovering
if
this
company
actually
goes
down
the
tubes
and
into
bankruptcy
as
a
general
unsecured
creditor.
therefore,
we
need
to
get
out
of
this
situation
fast.
and
they...
at
that
point,
they're
going
to
cancel
the
policy.
there's
going
to
be
much
more
of
a
hair
trigger
sense
of
the
need
to
cancel
policies.
when
they
cancel
policies,
the
immediate
consequence,
of
course,
is
that
the...
that
the
employees
are
no
longer
covered.
and
then,
the...
it
seems
to
me,
the
secondary
consequence,
which
is
also
quite
important--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it's
absolutely--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that...
i...
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
i
think
in...
in
the
real
common
practice
here,
the
amount
that
they
can
recover
and
the
amount
that
they
think
they
have
a
prospect
of
recovering
is
a
very
important
determinant
in
their
decision
on
whether
to
hang
in
and
how
long
to
hang
in
until
they
get
to
the
chapter
11
process
where
the
debtor
can
then
husband
its
assets
and
can
pay
the
workers'
compensation
premiums
as
an
administrative
claim.
so
i
think
it's
a...
it's
a
significant
determinant.
without
the
priority,
there's
going
to
be
a
hair
trigger,
which
means
coverage
is
terminated
sooner,
and
it's
going
to
mean
for
many
employers
that
they're
going
to
have
to
go
out
of
business
because
you
can't
operate
without--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
my
answer
would
be
the
same
as
to
the
chief
justice
that
in
some
sense,
i
suppose
you
could
say
it's
an
employee
benefit;
in
some
sense,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
there's
a
contract
to
provide
it.
but
i
think
you
can
set
the
outer
bounds
here
by
reference
to
the
employee
benefits
that
erisa
defined
as
employee
benefits.
but
in
any
event--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
breyer--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
first,
if
i
can
make
a
prefatory
point,
that
the
bottled
water
example
doesn't
distinguish
the
petitioners'
position
from
our
position.
the
petitioners'
position
is
that
if
it's
a...
if
it's
a
negotiated
for,
bargained
for
benefit,
it's
in.
so
i
don't
think
that's
a...
it
provides
a
limiting
principle.
and
it
seems
to
me,
wherever
the
line
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--right,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
right.
for
example,
in
the...
in
the
case
of
most
voluntarily
provided
health
insurance,
the
vast
majority
of
employees
in
this
country...
it's
not
bargained
for.
it's
something
an
employer
provides
unilaterally--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
the
fact
that
there
may
be
a
benefit
to
the
employer
doesn't
make
it
any
less
of
an
employee
benefit.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
plan
that
provides
employee
benefits,
and
the
insurance
coverage
provided
by
workers'
compensation
are
clearly
employee
benefits.
i
also...
and...
and,
of
course,
the
with...
with
respect
to
that
tradeoff,
that's...
that
tradeoff
is
an
employee
benefit
too,
justice
ginsburg,
because
the...
the
employee
has
no
fault
liability,
gets
paid
promptly
rather
than
have
to
sue
and
wait
years,
doesn't
lose
his
or
her
job
as
a
result
of
the
injury
or
as
a
result
of
bringing
the
lawsuit.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
make
the
judgment
that
it's
not
an
employee
benefit
plan
on
the
basis
of
that
fact.
and
of
course,
voluntarily
provided
benefits
also
benefit
the
employer
by
making
it
a
more
attractive
place
to
work
and...
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--better
morale.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
there
are
four
things
i'd
like
to
say
in
response
to
that,
justice
stevens.
first,
there
isn't
a
textual
hook
for...
for
that
being
a
determinant,
and
it...
and
it--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
the
second
think...
well,
i
think
to
the
contrary,
justice
stevens.
i
think
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
instances,
the
contributions
employers
make
to
employee
benefit
plans
is
the
payment
of
insurance
premiums
to
secure
the
benefits.
collectively
bargained
benefits
provided
by
union
trusts
are
a
small
minority
of
the
benefits
that
are
provided
to
workers
in
this
country.
but...
but
going
back
to
the
specific
question,
of
course,
as
justice
alito's
question
earlier
suggested,
in
a
multi
employer
pension
plan
situation,
the
plan
is
obligated
by
law
to
provide
all
vested
pension
benefits
whether
or
not
the
employee's
employer
has
defaulted
on
its
payments
into
the
fund.
so
it's
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
insurance
company
is
with
respect
to
that
set
of
benefits,
and
therefore,
the
argument
doesn't
draw
a
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
answer
is
no.
the
statute
expressly
covers
this.
the
last
provision
of
section
507
says
no
subrogation,
and
those
would
be
subrogation
situations.
so
the
statute
just
expressly
covers
it.
they
aren't...
they
don't
get
bumped
in
the
line,
period.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that.
if
i
could,
though,
return
to
a...
a
point
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
i
can't
direct
you
to
where
it
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
should
be
in
the
briefs.
it's
not,
but
that
is
what
the
last
section
of
507
says,
that
those
who
are
subrogated
to
the
rights
of
someone
with
a
priority
don't
get
the
priority.
so
that's
just
taken
care
of
by
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
does
increase
the
likelihood,
and
it
goes
back
to
the
example
i
was...
i
was
discussing
with
justice
souter
earlier.
and...
and
what...
it
will
not
affect
employees
who
are
injured
before
cancellation,
but
it
will
accelerate
cancellation.
and
as
a
result
of
accelerating
cancellation,
employers
who
are
injured
after
cancellation
will
not
get
the
benefits.
and
so
it
will--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
i
think
that...
i
think,
again,
that
last
section
of
507
takes
care
of
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
insurance
contract
is
not
in
the
record.
that's
right,
but
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--as
a
systematic
matter...
it
seems
to
me
as
a
systematic
matter,
this
is
what
insurance
companies
will
do.
i
don't
think
that's
dependent
actually,
justice
scalia,
on...
on
the
particular
terms
of
this
contract.
i'm
saying
as
a
systematic
matter
insurance
companies--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well...
well,
sure,
but
the
contracts
comply
with
state
law.
state
law
sets
notice
period
for
cancellation,
10
days
minimum,
up
to
30
days.
we've
cited
those
in
our
briefs.
and
so
in
most
states
and
in
many
states
here,
within
as
few
as
10
days
after
nonpayment,
you
can
cancel.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
that...
there
would
be
no
priority
there
because
that
would
be...
that
would
be
a
subrogated
claim,
and
the
last
section
of
section
of...
the
last
provision
of
section
507
says
if
you're
subrogated
to
a--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
claim
for
contribution
to
the
plan,
your
honor,
in
the
same
sense
that
we're
talking
about
here.
the...
if
i...
if
i
could--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i'm...
i
think
there's
an
order
of...
there's
another
order
of
degree
of
removal,
and
it
would
make
it
a
harder
question,
i
suppose,
as
to
whether
there
would
be
a...
whether
there
would
be
a
claim
for
priority
in
that
context.
but
i
think,
if
i
could,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
question
of
narrow
construction
where
we
started
the
argument.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
i
think
there
are
two
significant
points
there,
justice
ginsburg,
in
terms
of
the
history.
first,
in
1934
what
congress
said
was
that
workers'
compensation
could
be
a
provable
claim.
it
then
said
it's...
it
gets
the...
the
seventh
priority,
but
the
seventh
priority
was
not
a
priority
specific
to
workers'
compensation.
it
was
a
priority
that's...
it
was
a
provision
that
said
you
get
a
priority
if
state
law
provides
the
priority.
in
1938,
what
congress
did
was
wipe
out
that
provision
for
all
state
law
granted
priorities,
not
for
workers'
comp
in
specific.
so
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
was
a
specific
judgment
about
workers'
comp
and
its
place
in
the
priority
system.
and,
of
course,
you
didn't
have
the
well
developed
system
of
employee
benefit
plans
in
the
1930's
that
you
have
now.
and
what
congress
did,
when
it
enacted
this
provision
in
1978,
following
closely
after
erisa,
was
to
use
language
which
is
identical
to
erisa
in
providing
a
priority
for
employee
benefit
plans
which,
as
erisa
on
its
face,
i
think,
makes
clear,
would
encompass
workers'
compensation
plans.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
the
complete
explanation
for
the
relationship
between
(a)(3)
and
(a)(4)
was
that
congress
was
trying
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
priority
here
without
doing
damage
either
to
the
wage
priority
above
it,
which...
and...
and
there
would
have
been
damage
to
the
wage
priority
above
it
if
wages
were
simply
redefined
to
include
the
broader
set
of
employee
benefits...
or
to
the
priorities
below.
congress
just
took
the
aggregate
amount.
it
seems
to
me
just
an
elegant
solution
that
protects
the
wage
priority
above,
creates
a
new
priority,
and
doesn't
disadvantage
any
of
the...
any
of
the
priority
holders
below.
and
i
really
do
think
that's
the
complete
explanation
for
the
relationship
between
the
two.
you
really
can't
infer
anything
more
than
that.
but
if
i
could
just
address
the
so
called
rule
of
narrow
construction.
certainly
there
is
a
sentence
or
two
in
nathanson
and
embassy
restaurant,
but
those
were
such
clear
cases
of
statutory
construction
that...
that
the
rule
of
narrow
construction,
i
submit,
played
no
role
there.
in
many,
many
more
cases
in
which
this
court
has
interpreted
the
priority
provisions
of
the
act
and
the
code,
the
court
has
not
mentioned
this
idea
that
there's
a
rule
of
narrow
construction
or
that
the
principle
of
equality
of
distribution
to
creditors
should
trump
everything
else.
we've
cited
four
in
our
brief,
lewis,
shropshire,
ricketts,
and
sba
v.
mcclellan,
which
by
the
way,
expressly
cut
back
on
nathanson.
but
there
are
many
more
cases.
there's
a
whole
line
of
tax
priority
cases
culminating
in
the
reorganized
cf&i
fabricators
decision
in
which
the
courts
adjudicated
the
question
of...
of
the
scope
of
the
tax
priority.
most
of
the
time,
they
find
priority.
occasionally
they
find
no
priority.
but
in
none
of
those
cases
is
this
so
called
rule
of
construction
ever
mentioned
or
the
supposed
primacy
of
the
rule
of
equality
of...
of
the
principle
of
equality
of
distribution
ever
mentioned.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
fact
that
the
phrase
is
identical
to
the
phrase
that
appears
in
erisa,
employee
benefit
plan,
is
significant.
erisa
was
one
of
the
most
substantial
legislative
accomplishments
of
that
decade
of
the
1970's.
and
so
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
the
exact
same
language
appears
in
both
places,
importantly,
however,
with...
without
the
limiting
qualification
in
section
507(a)(4)
that
exists
in
erisa
itself
with
respect
to
workers'
compensation
plans.
i
also
think
that
if
the
court
does
look
at
the
legislative
history,
what...
what
one
learns
from
the
legislative
history
is
that
when
the
bill
was
originally
introduced
to...
to
create
this
priority,
it
created
a
priority
for...
proposed
to
create
a
priority
for
pensions,
insurance,
and
similar
employee
benefit
plans.
the
union
representatives
came
in
to
congress
and
said
that's
too
narrow.
we
need
something
significantly
broader
to
ensure
that
the
full
range
of
employee
benefits
is
protected
and
granted
this
priority.
what
the
union
representatives
all
urged
congress
to
do
was
to
adopt
the
erisa
definition
wholesale.
now,
we
don't
have
anything
in
the...
in
the
house
or
senate
report
saying
that's
what
we
did.
in
other
words,
we
intended
to
adopted
erisa
wholesale,
but
we
do
know
that
is
what,
in
fact,
they
did.
they
used
exactly
the
language
from
erisa
and
they
moved
it
into
the
priority
in
section
507.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the...
i
think
that
the
statute
could
be
read--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
could
be
the...
it
could
be
either,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
stevens.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
i...
but
i
don't
think
it
matters
in
this
case
because
you
get
to
the
same
answer
either
way.
if
it's
the
services
rendered
of
the
employees,
the...
the
claim
is
for
contributions
to...
for
the
cost
of
providing
insurance
to
those
employees
during
the
180
days.
if
it's
the
services
rendered...
the
provision
of
services
during
the
180
days--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
it...
but
it
arises
from.
the...
had...
i
think
it
arises
from
in
this
sense,
justice
scalia.
had
howard
shut
down
on
a
certain
day
and
didn't
have
employees
anymore,
it
wouldn't
have
any
continuing
obligation
to
or
need
to
pay
workers'
compensation
premiums
because
there
would
be
no
workers
to
cover.
and
so
it
arises
from--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--right,
but
you
don't
need--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but...
yes.
but
not...
but...
but
we...
let's
see.
i
think
that
maybe
this
will
clear
up
the
confusion.
we
continue
to
pay
for
them
even
after
the
policy
is
over--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and...
but...
and
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
depending
on
the
kind
of
policy,
that
may
be
true
to
some
extent.
sometimes
policies
are
loss
sensitive
policies
in
which
the
amounts
owed
are
calculated
very
carefully
with
respect
to
the
amounts
actually
of
loss
incurred
during
the
period.
that
is,
in
fact,
the
case
here.
if
you
have
an
understanding
of
insurance,
you
can
infer
that
from
the
charts
that
are
included
in
the
joint
appendix,
although
i
acknowledge
it's
very
difficult
to
do
so.
so
i
do
think...
i
do
think
on
any
common
sense
understanding
of
the...
of
the
phrase,
arising
from,
which
is
a
capacious
phrase,
it
really
does
arise
from.
but
in
terms
of...
i
think,
justice
stevens,
with
respect
to
your
question,
to
get
to
the
same
answer,
in
terms
of
calculating
the
amount
of
the
claim,
whichever
one
you
pick
here,
there's
actually
a
division
of
authority
in
the
lower
courts.
there's
a
fourth
circuit
opinion
by
judge
luttig,
saying
it's
services
rendered
by
the
insurance
company.
other
courts
say
services
rendered
the
employees.
since
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
in
this
case,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
probably
it
ought
not
to
be
decided
in
this
case
because
you
get
to
the
same
place
either
way.
i
do...
i
do
think
that
it's
important
also...
i'm
sorry.
excuse
me.
if
i
may
just
go
back
to
the
narrow
construction
rule.
the...
the
point
of
this
idea
of
primacy
of
equality
of
distribution.
equality
of
distribution
is
an
important
policy
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
but
it's
only
one
important
policy
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
rehabilitation
of
the
debtor
is
an
important
policy
under
the
code.
the
maximizing
the
value
of
the
estate
is
an
important
policy
under
the
code,
and
specific
code
provisions
advance
other
specific
policies
as
well.
so
in
any
given
case,
as
here,
all
of
those
copolicies
aren't
going
to
align
and
point
in
the
same
direction.
sometimes
they're
going
to
be
at
cross
purposes.
and
what...
what
the
court
said
in
union
bank,
in
i
think
a
closely
analogous
context
interpreting
the
ordinary
course
exemption
from...
from
the
preference
rule,
was
that
we
don't
put
a
thumb
on
the
scale
either
way
here.
we
don't
assume
that
one
of
these
policies
is
more
important
than
the
other.
what
we
assume
is
that
congress
struck
the
balance
between
the
potentially
competing
policies,
that
the
balance
is
reflected
in
the
text
of
the
statute
that
congress
enacted,
and
that
we
should
interpret
the
text
as
it's
written
without...
without
a
presumption
in
either
direction.
i
really
think
union
bank
is
highly
instructive
on
that,
and
it's
just...
it's
just
right
and
plain
common
sense.
and
that's
why
i
think
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
there
is
no
rule
of
narrow
construction.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
because
the
employer
doesn't
have
the
obligation
to
provide
unemployment
compensation.
that's
a
state
run
system
in
which
the
state
has
the
obligation
to
provide
the
benefit,
and
the
state
does
in
fact
provide
the
benefit.
it's
usually
funded
through
a
tax.
the
key
difference
is
this
is
an
employer
obligation
to
provide
these
benefits,
and
i
think
that's
why
this
is
an
employee
benefit
plan.
the
employer
is
obligated
to
provide
it
to
employees
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
employees
are
working
for
the
employer.
not
true
about
unemployment
compensation.
in
conclusion,
if
i
could
just
focus
on
the...
the
point
that
it
really
is
the
case
that
enforcing
this
priority,
as
it
is
written,
will
advance
the
purposes
for
which
congress
included
it
in
the
code.
it
will
protect
the
interests
of
workers,
millions
of
whom
have
no
employee
benefit
plan
other
than
workers'
compensation,
because
it
will
increase
the
prospects
that
that
money
is
there
to
pay
workers'
compensation
claims.
it
will
also
advance
the
code's
purpose
of
better
rehabilitation
because
it
will
give
insurance
companies
a
reason
not
to
pull
the
hair
trigger,
to
hang
in
there
with
these
companies,
and
to
allow
them
to
have
a
chance
rehabilitate
rather
than
forcing
them
into
liquidation
by
canceling
coverage
which
the
law
allows.
thank
you.
