justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
have
an
employer
who
says,
i
promise
to
give
$200
a
month
per
worker
to
a
fund,
which
money
will
go
to
pay
their
health
costs
when
they're
sick,
that's
plainly
covered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
suppose
it's
exactly
the
same,
but
instead
of
his
paying
$200
a
month,
he
pays
$200
to
an
insurance
company
in
return
for
a
promise
that
they'll
pay
precisely
the
same
amount
to
the
employee
if
he
gets
sick.
in
your
view,
that's
not
covered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course.
it's
not
meant
to
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
how
you
are
going
to
answer
my
hypothetical.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not...
i'm
asking
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
answer
my
hypothetical
please.
if
in
fact...
you
didn't
want
me
to
repeat
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
is
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
view,
is
my
hypothetical
covered
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore,
if
we
accept
your
interpretation,
then
all
those
employers
who,
instead
of
contributing
directly
to
health
funds,
instead
buy
insurance
policies
to
do
the
same
thing,
will
discover
they
do
not
have
the
advantage
of
the
fifth
priority.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
they
are
covered...
if
they
are
covered,
as
i
thought,
then
what
is
the
difference
whether
the
employer
buys
a
policy
whereby
the
insurance
companies
pays
for
their
health
benefit
when
they're
sick
or
pays
for
their
accident
benefit
when
they
have
an
accident
at
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's...
that's
a
better
way
to
put
it.
if...
if
that's
right,
then
what
you're
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
is
in
those
cases
where
an
employer
goes
to
an
insurance
company,
they
give
a
contractual
promise
to
pay
the
employee
when
he
gets
sick
in
return
for
a
premium
by
the
employer...
and
it's
a
health
benefit
or
a
vacation
benefit,
the
most
typical
thing...
you're
saying
all
those...
all
those...
there's
no
fifth
priority.
they
don't...
can't
take
advantage
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there...
there
are
two
parts
in
my
mind
to
this.
the
question
is
what
is
the
difference
between
a
workmen's...
worker
compensation
and
health
benefits.
i
agree
with
you,
so
far
tentatively,
that
that
difference
can't
lie
in
the
nature
of
the
contract
providing
the
benefit.
now,
i
know
they'll
want
to
argue
the
contrary,
but
put
that
to
the
side.
if
it
doesn't
depend
on
that,
it
depends
on
the
difference
between
workers'
compensation
and
health
benefits.
and
you
want
to
say
there
isn't
enough
of
a
difference
there,
though
they
argued
the
mandate
makes
a
difference.
of
course,
you
could
mandate
health
benefits
too,
and
i
don't
think
that
would
matter.
but
if
you're
right,
what
about
a...
a
long
term
contract
for
bottled
water
for
the
workers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
actually...
this
is...
to
me
anyway,
this
is
an
important
point
because
at
some
point
you
have
to
draw
the
line
between
the
things
of
a
kind
that
workers
might
bargain
for
and
things
not.
now,
if
that's
where
we're
getting
there,
the
history
of
workers'
compensation
may
cut
the
other
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
what's...
what's
the
principle
i'm
going
to
use?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they're
doing
that
to
get
a
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'd
like
to
know
what
your...
they're
trying
to
use
that
as
a
basis
for
separating
the
bottled
water
from
the
workmen's
comp
from
the
health
benefit.
and
they're
saying
here's
an
example
of
where
congress
put
the
workers'
comp
on
the
same
side
as
the
health
benefit.
now,
that's
their
approach.
what's
your
approach
to
the
standard?
what
rule
or
system
would
you
use
from
deciding
which
insured
for
or
paid
for
benefits
count
as
the
plan
and
which
ones
don't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if,
in
fact...
if,
in
fact,
the
state
legislature
mandates
certain
health
benefits,
then
the
plan
that
provides
those
benefits
would
no
longer
qualify.
