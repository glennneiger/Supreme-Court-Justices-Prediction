but
isn't...
doesn't
the
mechanism
take
into
account
the
number
of
employees
who
are
on
the
rolls
at
any
given
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then...
then
doesn't
the
premium
that
you're
supposed
to
pay
depend
in...
in...
on
the
number
of
employees
within
the
last
180
days,
which
in
turn
depends
on
their
working
in
the
last
180
days?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how...
maybe
you
just
don't
know
the
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that's...
that's
really
not
an
issue
for
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
want
to
make
it
an
issue,
you'd
have
to
get
the...
the
predicate
in
the
record
to
do
it,
and...
and
we
just
don't
have
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
we...
we
couldn't
resolve
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
consider
us
together,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
let...
let
me,
if
i
may,
ask
you
about
other
possible
wage
surrogates
because
what
you're
saying
now
seems
to
me
to
mesh
with
the
argument,
another
legislative
history
argument,
to
the
effect
that
the...
the
current
provision
was
meant
to
overrule
two
prior
cases
of
this
court.
and
the...
the
question
i
have
turns
on
the
fact
that
the...
the
language
is
broader
than
what
would
merely
have
been
necessary
to
overrule
those
cases.
so
my
question
is
if
the
broader
language
does
not
cover
the
premiums
that
we're
concerned
with
here,
what
other
items
dealing
with...
with
wage
substitutes
would
it
pick
up,
would
it
include?
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
if
they
don't
pay
the
premium
with
respect
to
the
180
days,
if
there's
an
accident
during
the
180
days,
the
insurance
doesn't
cover
the
accident.
