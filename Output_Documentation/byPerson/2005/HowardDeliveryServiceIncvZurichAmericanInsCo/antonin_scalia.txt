justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
is
the
unomitted
language?
what...
what
page
of
the
brief
are
you
quoting
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
erisa...
erisa
makes
it
very
clear
that...
that
a
plan
to
pay
insurance
for
employee
benefits,
whether
it's
disability
or
retirement
or
whatever
else,
is
an
employee
benefit
plan
and...
and
explicitly
excludes
workmen's
comp
because
otherwise
it
would
fall
within
that
definition
of
an
employee
benefit
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
that's
a
different
statute.
i'm
not
saying
that
the...
that
the
definitions
of
that
statute
have
to
apply
here,
but
the
definitions
of
that
statute
at
least
demonstrate
that
it
is
a
permissible
use
of
the...
of...
of
the
term
employee
benefit
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
tell
me
why.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you...
before
you
go
on,
could
you
satisfy
a
curiosity
of
mine?
maybe
mr.
verrilli
should
be
the
one
i
should
ask
this,
but
you
must
have
your...
your
version
of
it.
how
do
you
decide
whether
an
insurance
premium
is
for
work
that
was
done
within
the
last
180
days?
how...
how
do
you
calculate
it,
whether
that
characteristic
of
the...
of
the
statute
is
complied
with?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
if
it
said
premiums
due
within
the
last
180
days,
i
could
understand
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
else
establish
that
there's
no
conceivable
way
that
180
days
makes
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
together
on
this.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the...
the
correlative
hypothetical
would
be
a
plan
such
as
justice
breyer
describes
in
which
the
employer
has
contracted
to
pay
his
employees
$200
a
month
for
when
they're
sick,
and
that's
a
contractual
obligation
of
his,
and
then
he
buys
insurance
to
cover
that
contractual
obligation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
would
be
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
wouldn't
be
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
(a)(3)
appear?
there...
there
was
that
discussion
in
your
brief,
and
i'm
darned
if
i
could
find
(a)(3).
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
it
in
your
brief--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
numbered...
numbered
3
instead
of
4.
that
would
have
helped
a
lot.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
begging
the
question
by
calling
it
a
plan.
i
mean,
that...
that's...
that's
one
of
the
issues
here.
why
don't
you
tell
us
what
workmen's
compensation
laws
require?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
answer
to
the
180
days'
question
i
answered...
i
asked?
you
know,
the
provision
provides
contributions.
it
doesn't
say
just
contributions
to
an
employee
benefit
plan.
it
says
contributions
to
an
employee
benefit
plan
arising
from
services
rendered,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
but...
but
the
services
have
to
be
within
the
last
180
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
square
that
with...
with
the
purchase
of
block
insurance
like
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
each
of
those
insurance
premiums
that's
paid
by
the
employer
doesn't
just
cover
workers
who
worked
for
the
last
180
days.
each
premium
is
divided
among
all
the
workers
who've
been
working
there
for
years.
some
of
the
premiums
are
going
to
go
to...
to
allow
the
insurance
company
to
pay
in
the
future
people
who
have
been
there
for
20
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
just
seems
to
me
it's
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole.
i...
i
don't
see
how
you
make
sense
out
of
that
180--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
really
think
that...
that
they
cut
it
that
fine?
they
say,
oh,
yes,
this
guy
is
going
to
go
into
bankruptcy.
we're
pretty
sure
about
that,
but
don't
worry.
we'll
have
priority.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
as
soon
as
they
smell
bankruptcy,
they're
going
to
pull
the
plug
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
arising
from
services
rendered.
i
mean,
it...
it
really
has
to
be
part
of
the
contract
with
the
employer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
verrilli,
what...
what
is
your
response
to
mr.
strain's
assertion
that
if
you
get
a
priority,
so
should
the
secondary
insurer,
that
is,
the...
the
bank
that
gave
letters
of
credit?
they're
just
insuring...
that...
that's
part
of
the
plan
too.
they
couldn't
have
gotten
the
insurance
from
you
unless
they
got
the
letters
of...
of
credit
from
the
bank,
which
is
a
kind
of
secondary
insurance.
and
also
in
the
case
of
self
insurance,
which
is
something
of
a
plan...
i...
i
guess
you'd
call
it
a
plan...
what
about
the...
the
person
who
puts
up
the
bond?
that
person
is
a
kind
of
insurer,
just
as
you
are.
do
all
of
these
people
now...
now
get
bumped
up
to
the
head
of
the
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
does
that
appear?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
because
it's
not
in
the
briefs--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just...
just
as
the
contract
isn't
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
what
you've
just
told
us?
is
that
in
the
record?
you're
just
assuring
us
what
the
content
of
the
insurance
contract
is.
right?
but
we
don't
have
the
insurance
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we...
we
have
your
assurance
that
that's
what
happens
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
has
to
be
that
way?
i
could
write
a
contract
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
it's
not
just
to
those.
it's
to
a
lot
of
other
people.
i
mean,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
except
the
workers
who
had
already
been
injured
in
the
past--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and...
and
whom
you
continue
to
pay.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
that
each
of
your
premiums
takes
into
account
the
fact
that
you're
not
only
going
to
be
paying
for
people,
you
know,
who
were
injured
between
the
last
premium
and
now,
but
that
you're
also
going
to
be
paying
for
people
who
were
injured
a
long
time
ago.
