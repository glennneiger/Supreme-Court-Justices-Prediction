mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
respondents'
complaint
alleges
that
petitioner
has
entered
into
a
long
term,
collaborative
venture
with
outside
recruiters
in
order
to
perpetrate
hundreds,
if
not
thousands
of
violations
of
federal
immigration
law.
that
sort
of
concerted,
ongoing
racketeering
activity
alleged
in
the
complaint
is
encompassed
by
the
text
of
18
u.s.c.
1962(c)
and
it
directly
implicates
section
1962(c)'s
core
purpose.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
now,
with
respect
to
the
textual
question,
our
argument
is
not
that
the
collaborative
venture
alleged
in
this
complaint
falls
within
the
terms
of
section
1961(4).
our
argument
is
that
it
falls
within
the
usual
background
understanding
of
the
term
enterprise
and
that
it's
not
excluded
from
the
statute
by
operation
of
1961(4).
to
take
the
first
point
first,
if
congress
had
not
defined
the
term
enterprise
at
all,
but
had
used
the
term
enterprise
in
1962(c),
this...
the
courts
construing
the
provision
would
have
had
to
determine
whether
the
term
enterprise
was
naturally
encompassed...
was
naturally
construed
to
encompass
not
simply
discrete
legal
entities
but
collaborations
between
discrete
actors.
and
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
term
would
have
been
construed
to
include
such
ventures.
that
is,
the...
rico
was
enacted
against
the
backdrop
of
the
travel
act
which
prevented
the
use
of
business
enterprises
to
perpetrate
particular
crimes
and
it
was
well
established
that
a
business
enterprise
meant
not
simply
a
corporation
or
similar
discrete
legal
entity--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
there
are
several
reasons.
first,
this
court's
decisions
make
clear
that
while
includes
may
be
construed
as
exclusive,
if
it
appears
alone,
when
congress
employs
the
means/includes
structures...
structure
and
introduces
some
definitions
with
the
word
means
and
others
with
the
word
includes,
that
choice
of
verb
should
be
taken
as
advertent,
and
the
court
shouldn't
likely
conclude
that
congress
simply
used
the
terms
as
interchangeable.
second--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
but
the...
the
includes--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
would
be
a
big
difference
if
the
phrase,
including
but
not
limited
to,
appeared
in
another
provision
of
1961,
but
that's
not
where
the
phrase
appears.
the
phrase
appears
in,
i
believe
it's,
1964(c)
which
deals
with
the...
the
civil
remedies
provision,
and
where--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--where
the
word
includes
stood
alone
within
that
section,
it
was
natural
for
congress
to
use
what
we
call
a...
a
belt
and
suspenders
approach,
making
it
clear
that
the
word
includes
shouldn't
be
taken
as
exclusive.
the
second
point
i'd
make
is
that
the
last
of...
i
believe
it's
the
last
provision
of
1961(4)
is
the
definition
of
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
and
that
definition
is
introduced
by
the
word
requires.
the
term
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
requires
at
least
two
racketeering
acts
committed
not
more
than
10
years
apart.
and
this
court
in
sedima
and
then
in
h.j.,
incorporated
has
attached
significance
to
that
choice
of
verbs
and
has
explained
that
congress'
use
of
the
word
requires,
rather
than
the
verb
means,
implies
that
two
are
necessary
but
not
necessarily
sufficient.
so
when
we're
construing
a
provision
in
which
the
court
has
already
recognized
that,
at
least
in
some
instances,
congress'
use
of
varying
verbs
to
introduce
the
different
subsections
will
be
taken
as
significant--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
in
terms
of
speculation
about
congress's
motive,
i
think
you're
very
likely
right
that
the
reason
congress
added
a
specific
reference
to
groups
of
individuals
was
that
they
were
thinking
in
terms
of
mob
families
or
syndicates,
criminal
gangs
that
had
no
discrete
status
as
a
legal
entity.
they're
not
incorporated,
but
they
function
as
unit.
and
they
had
those
in
mind,
and
they
intended...
they
wanted
to
make
sure
those
were
covered
even
though
they
were
not
discrete
legal
entities.
and
i
think
you're
likely
right
that
the
reason
they
didn't
specifically
include
groups
of
corporations
is
that
they
didn't
have
them
in
mind
as
likely
sources
of
trouble
at
the
time.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
whether
they
intended
to
exclude
the
coverage
of
those
alliances
if
they
would
otherwise
be
encompassed
by
the
normal
meaning
of
the
term
enterprise.
and
if
it
came
to
cause
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--exactly.
if...
if
the
term
enterprise
appeared
in
1962(c)
but
were
an
undefined
term--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there...
there
is
in
the
legislative
history.
that
is,
the
legislative
history
describes
the
coverage
of
the
term
enterprise
as
encompassing
any
associative
group.
now,
we
don't
contend
from
that
stray
reference
that
congress
specifically
had
in
mind
alliances
between
corporations
and
specifically
intended
to
include
them.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
that
legislative
history
is
inconsistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
congress
anticipated
the
problem
of
alliances
of
corporations
and
carefully--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--first,
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
after
all
the
tools
of
statutory
construction
are
applied,
there
is
a
genuine
and
certainly
not
a
grievous
ambiguity.
that
is,
there...
there
are
two
potential
sources
of
ambiguity.
one
could
simply
be
there's
uncertainty
about
whether
the
word
enterprise,
taken
alone,
would
typically
be
construed...
nobody
is
contending--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the...
the
only
question
is
whether
this
list
should
be
taken
to
exclude
things
that
are
not
on
the
list
even
though
they
would
otherwise
be
encompassed
by
the
normal
meaning
of
the
word
enterprise.
and
this
court
in
many
decisions
has
given
congress
a
template.
it
said
if
you
use
the
means/includes
dichotomy,
we
will
take
that
choice
to
be
advertent
and
we
will
assume
that
when
you
use
means
that's
intended
to
be
exclusive;
when
you
use
includes,
that's
intended
to
be
not
exclusive.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that...
that
was
part
of
justice
alito's
question,
and
i
think
there
are
two
different
senses
in
which
a
statutory
list
could
be
considered
exclusive
or
comprehensive.
that
is,
one
would
be
legal
exclusivity.
for
instance,
the
definition
of
racketeering
activity
says
racketeering
activity
means
acts
indictable
under
the
following
statutes.
that
definition
is
legally
exclusive
in
the
sense
that
if...
if
congress
enacted
a
new
statute
and
it
prohibited
conduct
that
was
classic
mob
activity,
but
it
wasn't
on
the
list
of
rico
predicates,
we
would
say
that's
out,
it's
not
racketeering
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
even
though
it
would
be
racketeering
activity
within
a
common
understanding.
i
think
with
the
definition
of
attorney
general,
what
we
have
is
a
different
sort
of
comprehensiveness.
that
is,
it
may
well
be
that
the
definition
of
attorney
general
is
comprehensive
in
the
sense
of
actually
listing
all
the
people
who
could
otherwise
plausibly
be
regarded
as
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
attorney
general.
it
may
be
that
congress,
when
it
promulgated
the
list,
got
everything
that
would
have
been
covered
anyway.
it's
not
legally
comprehensive
or
legally
exclusive
in
the
sense
of
directing
courts
that
even
an
official
who
would
otherwise
be
regarded
as
an
appropriate
surrogate
for
the
attorney
general
is
not
to
be
so
regarded
if
he's
off...
off
the
list.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i...
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
in
the
context
of
a
federal
statute
referring
to
the
attorney
general,
a
state
attorney
general
would
typically
be
encompassed
within
the
meaning
of
that
provision
even
if
that
provision
were
undefined,
whereas
i
think
because
executive
power
is...
is
generally
deemed
to
be
delegable,
subordinate
officials
standing
in
the
shoes
of
a
cabinet
officer
would
usually
be
thought
to
be
encompassed
by
the
reference
to
the
cabinet
officer
alone.
the
other
thing
we
would
say,
of
course,
on
the...
the
statutory
point
is
that
there
have...
there
has
been
a
unanimous
pattern
of
court
of
appeals
decisions
in
this
area.
congress
has
not
acted
to
contract
the
definition
of
enterprise,
but
instead
has
added
new
predicate
acts.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i've
looked
at
them
and...
i
would
agree
with
mr.
phillips
that
the
analysis
doesn't
tend
to
be
lengthy,
but
i
think
feldman
would
be
one.
by
and
large,
the...
the
courts
adopt
the...
the
reasoning
that
we've
adopted
here,
namely
that
because
the
word
includes
signals
an
intent
to
be
nonexhaustive
or
to
admit
of
other
things
being
covered
even
if
they're
not
on
the
list,
then
they
should
be
covered.
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
recall
any
dissents
at
least
on
the
point.
i...
i
don't
want
to
represent
that
there
have
never
been
any.
i
don't
recall
any
dissents
at
least
on
the...
the
pure
question
of
whether
an
association
in
fact
comprised
in
part
of
artificial
legal
entities
can
ever
be
covered.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
know
of
any
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
really
focus
on
that...
focuses
on
that
aspect
of
the
question.
but...
but,
again,
we
can
accept
kind
of
the
factual
premises
about
what
led
congress
to
draft
the
legislation
as
it
did,
namely
that
it
anticipated
the
problem
of
groups
of
individuals
banding
together
to
commit
criminal
acts
and
didn't
anticipate
the
problem
of
groups
of
corporations
banding
together
for
like
purposes.
but
i
think
the
whole
point
of
having
a
template,
having
an
established
rule
that
means
and
includes,
when
they're
used
in
the
same
statutory
provision
will
be
taken
as
meaning
different
things,
as
to
give
congress
a
clue
that
if
you've
tried
to
list
everything
but
you're
not
sure
that
you've
got
it
all,
here's
the
way
that
you
can
ensure
that
some
new
arrangement
that
would
otherwise
fall
within
the
defined
term
is
not
going
to
be
knocked
out,
and
if
you
want
it
to
be
knocked
out,
use
the
words
means.
with
respect
to
the
second
argument,
that
the...
the
core
of
petitioner's
position
is
that
it
can't
be
held
liable
under
rico
because
it's
simply
conducting
its
own
business,
and
i
think
that's
wrong
for
two
reasons.
first,
there's
no
rule
that
says
a
corporation
can't
simultaneously
in
a
single
act
be
conducting
its
own
business
and
the
business
of
a
separate
enterprise,
and
i
think
h.j.,
incorporated
is
an
example
of
that.
the
allegation
in
that
case
was
that
a
utility
corporation
and
its
officers
had
engaged
in
a
systematic
pattern
of
bribing
the
members
of
a
public
utility
commission
to
allow
the
corporation
to
charge
higher
rates.
and
the
suit
was
allowed
to
go
forward
on
the
theory
that
through
the
pattern
of
bribery,
the
utility
was,
in
practical
terms,
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
public
utility
commission's
affairs.
now,
clearly
in
attempting
to
bribe
the
utility
commission
members,
the
utility
was,
in
a
sense,
conducting
its
own
business.
that
is,
viewed
at
a
high
level
of
generality,
efforts
to
persuade
rate
setting
bodies
to
allow
a
utility
to
charge
higher
rates
are
an
integral
part
of
the
utility's
own
business.
that
didn't
prevent
it
from
simultaneously
being
a
means
of
participating
in
the
conduct
of
a
different
entity's
business.
and
second,
there's
more
alleged
in
this
complaint,
and
i
think
some
of
the
questions
brought
this
out.
may
i
finish
my
sentence?
there's
more
alleged
in
the
complaint
than
simply
the
unlawful
hiring
of
illegal
aliens.
there
are
hiring
inducement
and
transporting
offenses
that
would
constitute
separate
violations
that
are
antecedent
to
but
not
part
of
mohawk's
business.
