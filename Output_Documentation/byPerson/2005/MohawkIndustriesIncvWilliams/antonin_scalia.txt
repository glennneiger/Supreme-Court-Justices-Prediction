justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
to
your
second
point,
why
is
that
first
point
before
us?
you...
you
didn't
raise
it
in
the
courts
below.
you
didn't
raise
it
in
your
petition
here.
your
question
presented
it...
i'd
like
to
stretch
to
reach
it,
but
i
don't
even
find
it
necessarily
included
within
the
question
presented.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
defendant
corporation
and
its
agents
engaged
in
ordinary,
arms
length
dealings
can
constitute
an
enterprise
in
light
of
the
settled
rule
that
a
rico
defendant
must
conduct
or
participate
in
the
affairs
of
some
distinct
enterprise
and
not
just
its
own
affairs.
it
seems
to
me
it's
only
question
two
you
put
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
it
is
in
nine
other
circuits.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
circuits
against
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
would
have
been
unlikely
to
accept
cert
on...
on
point
one
alone
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
light
of
the
settled
rule
that
a
defendant
must
conduct
or
participate
in
the
affairs
of
some
distinct
enterprise
and
not
just
its
own
affairs.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
hadn't
included
that
last
part,
in
light
of,
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
focusing
on
the...
on
the
particular
claim
that
you're
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
logically
prior,
and
i
hate
to
go
through
all
the
trouble
of
figuring
out
this
case
if,
indeed,
corporations
are
ineligible
anyway.
i
mean,
you
know,
we're...
we're
answering
a
totally
hypothetical,
nonexistent
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
this
provision
is
exclusive,
as
you
claim
it
is...
it's
intended
to
be
an
exclusive
definition,
why...
why
would
they
include
union,
just
union
and
individuals?
what's
magic
about
a
union
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
not
equally
magic
about
a
partnership
or
a
corporation?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
refers
to
a
union
that
is
not...
is
not
an
association.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
any
legal
entity.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
union
that
is
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
a
legal
entity.
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
i...
i
tend
to
agree
with
that,
but
i...
i
just
hate
to
get
the
lower
courts
into
this
business
of
determining
when
a
corporation
is
going
beyond
its
business.
your...
your
discussion
with
justice
souter
i
think
indicates
how...
how
hard
that
is,
or
some
of
the
examples
that
the
government
brings
up,
such
as
a
drug
company
that...
that
sells
drugs
illegally,
violating
the
drug
laws.
is
that
part
of
its
business
or
not
part
of
its
business?
i...
i
really
don't...
don't
want
to
buy
into
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
your
point
regarding
union
helps
you
any
because
if...
if
you...
if
you
win
the
point
that
union
doesn't
mean
a
labor
union,
you
still
have,
as...
as
the
end
of
this
definition,
any
union
or
group
of
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
union
of
individuals
or
a
group
of
individuals.
you're
still
stuck
with
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
either
union
means
labor
union
or
it
means
a
union
or
group
of
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
give
you
that.
then...
then
it
means
a
union
or
group
of
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so,
you
know,
you're
just
as
bad
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
reves
demonstrates
that...
that
your
statement
earlier
that
since
it
was
fraudulent
action,
it
couldn't
have
been
the
business
of
the
corporation
is
simply
false.
we...
we
haven't
held
that
whenever
a
corporation
violates
the
law,
it
goes
beyond
its
business,
although
in
a
sense
it
does.
in
reves,
we...
we
said
it
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
that's...
we
have
to
get
into
that
is
my
point.
we
can't
just
say
since
providing
them
with...
with
phony
id's
is
unlawful,
it
can't
be
the
business
of
the
corporation.
justice
antonin
scalia
do...
do
any
of
those
cases
that
you
allude
to
that
have
means
in
some
sections
and
includes
in
others...
do
any
of
them
have
in
third
sections,
includes,
comma,
without
limitation,
comma?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
that's
a
big
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
close
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
this...
this
thing
is
at
least...
at
least...
ambiguous.
why
shouldn't
we
apply
the
rule
that
we
normally
apply
with
regard
to
criminal
statutes
that
where
there
is
an
ambiguity,
the
rule
of
lenity
applies
and
we
shouldn't
give
the...
the
government
license
to...
to
ride
closer
herd
than...
than
is
clear
in
the
statute?
why
isn't...
why
isn't
that
an
easy
way
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--resolve
this
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
irrelevant
because
it's
not
taken
alone.
it
is
defined.
so
the
only...
the
only
question
is
what
this...
what
this
definition
means.
is
it
exclusive
or
not
exclusive?
that's
really
the
only
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
even...
even
when
it's
absolutely
clear
and...
and
as
pointed
out
by...
by
your
friend,
you...
you
did
not
refute
the
point
that
in
other
sections
where
it
says
includes,
it
is
unquestionable
that
it
is
exclusive.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
best
court
of
appeals
opinion,
the
most
thoroughly
considered?
i
haven't
read
any
of
them.
tell
me...
tell
me
the
best
one.
i'd
like
to
read
it.
