justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it's...
it's
a
little
more
difficult
in
your
case
because
you're
pursuing
an
interlocutory
appeal,
which
you
were
allowed
to
do
only
because
you've
got
double
certification
and
you
got
certification
on
the
questions
that
the
district
court
addressed.
you
can't
expand
a
1292(b)
order
to
include
things
that
were
not
decided
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
weren't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
weren't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
weren't...
your
problem
is
you
don't
have
a
final
judgment.
the
only
way
that
you
can
get
even
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
on
that
1292(b)
order.
and
i
thought
that
the
function
of
1292(b)
was
to
say
specify
the
questions
that
are
so
important
that
they
have
to
be
decided
and
appealed
before
there's
a
final
judgment.
and
whatever
there
might
have...
whatever
one
might
read
into
a
question
presented,
i
don't
think
that
1292(b)
orders
have
ever
been
treated
that
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if...
if--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
mohawk
were
a
partnership
instead
of
a
corporation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
partnership
is
an
association
of
individuals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
the
answer
is
yes,
if
mohawk
had
been
a
partnership,
you
would
not
have
this
particular
objection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
only
the
corporate
form.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
about
the
partnership
because
it
is
an
association
of
individuals.
so
i'm
not
clear
on
what
your
answer
is.
no
partnership
could
be
treated
just
like
a
corporation.
they're
not
an
individual?
or
partnerships
are
okay
because
there's
not
a
separate
entity.
it's
a...
it's
a
association
of
individuals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
it
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
position
was
it
shouldn't
be
read
at
all
because--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this...
this
court
is
a
court
of
review,
and
to
take
a
question
that
was
never
certified,
even
to
the
court
of
appeals,
to
have
this
court
address
it
seems
to
me
very
strange.
it
seems
to
me
to
erode
rather
starkly
the
final
judgment
rule,
which
we
don't
have
here.
