mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
involves
the
somewhat
murky
concept
of
an
association
in
fact
enterprise
within
the
meaning
of
section
1961(4)
of
title
18,
which
is
the
rico
statute,
and
actually
the
specific
language
in
this
case,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
page
2,
is
a
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact.
in
this
case,
there
are
two
fairly
obvious
enterprises
that
one
might
have
expected
plaintiff
to
identify
in
this...
in
its...
in
their
complaint.
the
first
one
is
mohawk
industries,
which
is
their
employer.
that
is
a
corporation,
clearly
eligible
to
serve
as
an
enterprise.
but,
of
course,
the
problem
is
if
you
identify
mohawk
as
the...
as
the
enterprise,
you
then
cannot
sue
mohawk
as
the
person
under
this
court's
decision
in
kushner.
and
so
mohawk
was
an
unattractive
enterprise
under...
on
that...
because
of
that
reason.
second,
there
are
the
recruiting
and
temporary
agencies
which
are
likely
corporations
and
certainly
are
legal
entities
and,
again,
are
eligible
to
be
enterprises
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
but,
again,
here
the
problem
is
that
there
is
no
indication
that
mohawk
in
any
way
directs
or
conducts
the
affairs
of
those
agencies,
and
therefore,
under
this
court's
explicit
holding
in
reves,
there
would
no...
there
would
be
no
basis
for
liability.
and
so
the
plaintiffs
have
attempted
to
sort
of
move
around
those
two
substantial
obstacles
to
stating
a
claim
by
laying
the
claim
to
what
is
called
an
association
in
fact
enterprise.
their
complaint
at
paragraph
76,
which
is
on
page
23
of
the
joint
appendix,
states
this
fairly
broadly.
mohawk
has
participated
in
an
association
in
fact
enterprise
with
third
party
employment
agencies
and
other
recruiters.
the
question
is
what
is
this
enterprise
and
does
it
have
legs
for
purposes
of
bringing
a
rico
action.
in
analyzing
that
question,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
subissues
within
that.
the
first
one
is
whether
or
not
the
language
of
section
1961(4)
precludes
using
the
corporation
as
part
of
an
association
in
fact
enterprise
because
1961(4)
explicitly...
or
specifically
refers
to
individuals,
and
everyone
has
recognized,
including
i
think
the
respondents
and
the
united
states,
that
if...
if
it
were
clear
that
association
in
fact
enterprises
or
that
enterprises
limited
to
individuals
under
these
circumstances,
given
the
structure
of
the
statute,
the
corporation
would
not
be
permissibly
brought
in
on
this
particular
theory.
so
you
have
to
get
past
whether
or
not
that
is
a
limiting
principle
under
this
definition.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
scalia,
the...
the
answer...
a
couple
answers.
first
of
all,
obviously,
we
could
not
have
raised
this
before
the...
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
law
was
absolutely
settled
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
it
is
in
nine
other
circuits.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
the
second...
but
the
question
is
not...
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
issue
is
fairly
subsumed
within
the
question
that
was
actually
presented,
and
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the...
the
question
presented
in
this
case...
and
it's
the
same
question
that
was
presented
below...
is
whether
the
defendant
corporation
and
its
agents
under
these
circumstances
can
constitute
an
enterprise.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure.
but
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but,
justice
scalia,
the
in
light
of
certainly
raises
the
secondary
issue,
but
it's
still...
i
mean,
the
rule
is
whether
it's
fairly
subsumed
within
the
question.
and
it
is
a
logically
prior
question
whether
or
not
the
statute
extends
to
this
particular
situation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
the
situation
that's
presented
here
is
identical
to
the
situation
that
existed
in
mcnally
v.
united
states,
justice
scalia.
in
that
case,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
an
intangible
rights
theory
of
mail
fraud
could
be
extended
to
include
nongovernment
officials.
that
was
the
specific
question
presented
in
that
case,
and
that's
the...
the
question
the
court
granted.
and
every
court
of
appeals
had
interpreted
that
statute
to
say
that
intangible
rights
theories
are
valid
under
that
statute.
and...
and
that
issue
was
not
adverted
to
in
the
petition,
and
it
was
briefed
in
this
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
it
was
regarded
as
fairly
subsumed
just
as--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i...
i
don't
have
any
specific
authority
to
the
contrary,
although
the
other
side
didn't
argue
1292(b)
as
in
some
sense
a
limitation
here.
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
this
court's
rules
which
broadly
authorize
the
court
to
grant
certiorari
to
any
question
that's
fairly
subsumed
within
the
question
presented.
and
it
is
a
totally
artificial
inquiry
to
sit
here
and
say,
you
know,
how
are
we
going
to
analyze
what
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the...
the
clause
that
introduces
that
is
under
current
law,
and
that's
absolutely
true
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
under
current
law,
as
it
existed
in
the
eleventh
circuit
when
we
wrote
that,
there
was
no
question
that
a
corporation
can
be
included
within
an
association
in
fact
enterprise.
therefore,
all
we
were
doing
was
conceding
what
the
state
of
the
law
was
in
the
eleventh
circuit
and
not
questioning
that,
as...
as,
candidly,
we
had
no
ability
to
do
that.
it
would
have
been
an
utterly
futile
gesture
to
have
raised
this
issue
at
any
point
prior
to.
we
could
have
raised
it
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
to
be
sure.
we...
we
think
it
is
fairly
subsumed
within
the
question
presented,
and
we
also
think
it
would
be
an...
an
utterly
artificial
exercise
to
try
to
analyze
what
is
an
association
in
fact
enterprise
without
first
deciding
whether
or
not
a
corporation
could
be
included
in
the
first
instance
because,
as
justice
scalia
says,
if
they
can't,
then
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
substantially
easier
question,
and
also
it
is
an
extraordinarily
important
one.
it
is
true
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
lined
up
consistently
on
the
other
side
of
this
issue,
but
it
is
equally
true
that
none
of
them
has
analyzed
this
issue
with
anything
near
the
kind
of
care
that
would
at
least
give
me
comfort
that
they've
finally
and
fully
resolved
the
issue.
and
we're
not
going
to
get
a
more
thorough
vetting
of
it
at
this
point
because
the
circuits
are...
are
at
this...
at
this
stage
essentially
lined
up.
so
the
right
time
and
opportunity
for
the
court
is
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
all
of
those
courts
are
going
to
say
the
same
thing,
which
is
that
this
issue
has
been
resolved.
it's
possible,
presumably,
you
might
get
an
en
banc
review
on
it,
but
again,
you
don't
have
the
question...
you
don't
have
a
split
anywhere
other
than
some
district
court
decisions
that
have...
that
have
recognized
our
interpretation.
the
issue
is
squarely
posed
here
at
this
point.
it's
been
fully
briefed
for
this
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
all
of
those
various
combinations
can
still
be
attacked
under
the
theory
of
rico
by
just
simply
structuring
your...
your
enterprise
in
the
proper
way.
it
is
true
you
can't
broaden
it.
you
can't
expand
the
enterprise
definition
in
order
to
include
a
variety
of
different
elements,
but
there's
no
way...
i
mean,
in
this
case,
for
instance,
they
could
have
named
mohawk
as
the
enterprise.
they
could
have
named
the...
the
recruiting
agencies
as
the
enterprise.
they
could
have
named
the
corporate
officers
as
the
enterprise,
and
they
could
have
dealt
with
all
of
them
as
a
conspiracy.
and
all
of
those
are
ways
to
get
at
precisely
the
issues
that
you
identify,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
the
answer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
a
partnership
is
identified
specifically
under
the
statute
as
a...
as
a...
as
an
enterprise...
as
eligible
for
an
enterprise.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
that
wouldn't
be
this
particular--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no.
if
we
were
a
partnership,
it
couldn't
be
in
an
enterprise
with...
with
an
association
of
individuals.
the
question
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--does...
can
you
have
an
associational
enterprise
that
extends
beyond
individuals,
that
gets...
that
goes
beyond
the
gangs
and
their
family.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
let
me
be
clear
on
this,
that
if...
if
you
just
bring
an
action
against
the
partnership
qua
partnership
you
could
clearly
do
that
because
that's
defined
as
a...
as
a
legal
entity--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--for
purposes...
if
you're
trying
to
take
the
partnership
and
tag
it
to
another
group
of
rag
tag
individuals,
that
would
not
be
an
enterprise
in
fact
because
that's
not
an...
an
association
of
individuals.
it's
a
partnership
which
has
an
entity
apart
from
the
individuals.
now,
if
you
disaggregated
all
of
the
individuals
within
the
partnership
and
called
them
individuals
and
said
that
they
group
with
another
group
of
individuals,
then,
yes.
i
think
if
you
could
demonstrate
that
there
is
the
loose
organization,
common
purpose,
and
all
of
the
requirements
for
having
an
association
in
fact
available,
sure,
that
wouldn't
be
any
problem.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
well,
because
what
they
have...
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
original
list.
the
list
starts
off
with
individuals,
corporations,
partnerships,
associations,
and
other
legal
entities,
unions,
which
is
in
addition
to
that
because
it's
not
a
legal
entity,
or
at
least
there
was
case
law
at
the
time--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
it's
not
a
legal
entity.
and
then
other
associations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
this
is
just
a
union.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
just
an
additional
item
in
the
list.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
i
think
they
viewed
those
as
absolutely
synonymous,
justice
alito,
and...
and
the
reason
i
think
that
is
because
we
know
that
in
some
instances
they
use
including
but
not
limited
to,
which
reflects
that
congress
recognized
that
includes
in
some
contexts
is
an
exhaustive
listing,
and
i
think
they
thought
in
some
contexts,
meaning
1961(4),
that
it
was
an
exhaustive
listing.
and
also,
it's
important
to
look
at
the
other
definitions
of
1961(4),
and
i
think
this
is
the
most
important
element
of
the
other
side's
submission
in
this
case
because
they
do
no
business
with
any
of
the
other
definitions.
the
attorney
general,
the
definition
of
property
for
forfeiture
purposes,
those
are
unquestionably
exhaustive
lists.
at
least,
that's
the
way
i...
we
argued
it.
they
didn't
respond
to
that.
and
yet,
those
are
introduced
with
the
term
includes.
so
it
strikes
me
that
the
best
contextual
evidence
of
what
congress
intended
here
was
that
includes
would
be
used
exhaustively
and
that
the
use
of
individuals
of
associated
in
fact
would
be
used
as
a
limiting
principle,
not
as
part
of
an
exhaustive
principle
that
expands
the
scope
of
this
beyond...
beyond...
into
a
realm
where
it
becomes
nothing
but
a
mere
conspiracy
statute,
which
is
what
it
is
today
under
this...
under
this
particular
theory.
that's...
unless
there
are
further
questions
about
the
straight
statutory
interpretation
question,
then
i
would
go
to
the
second
issue,
which
is
assuming
that
corporations
can,
nevertheless,
be
involved
in
association
in
fact
enterprises,
does
this
state
such
a
thing.
and
here,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
court's
opinion
in
reves,
and
in
reves,
what
the
court
held
is
that
liability
depends
on
showing
that
the
defendants
conducted
or
participated
in
the
conduct
of
the
enterprise's
affairs,
not
just
their
own
affairs.
okay?
so
it
is
an
element
of
rico
liability
that
you
have
to
distinguish
the...
the
corporate
defendant's
affairs
in
that
case
and...
and
the
affairs
of
the...
of
the
enterprise
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
souter,
that
is
the
only
allegation
that
comes
remotely
close
to
suggesting
anything
along
those
lines,
but
i...
my
submission
to
you
is
that
it
doesn't
get
you
there
because
what
it
says
is
that
the
recruiters
are
sometimes
assisted...
it
does
say
the
recruiters...
by
mohawk
employees
who
carry
social
security
cards
which
they
use
for
prospective
or
existing
employees'
needs
to
assume
a
new
identity.
that's
when
they
come
to
mohawk
as
applicants
or
as
employees,
mohawk
provides
them
with
this
identification.
that's
the
allegation.
that's
simply
mohawk
conducting
its
own
affairs.
that's
not
conducting
or
directing
the
affairs.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
doubt
that
there's
a
claim
that...
that
there's
illegality.
all
of
this
is
permeated
with
claims
of
illegality.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
so
because
even
in
reves,
the...
ernst
&
young
had
been
found
to
have
engaged
in
illegality,
that
there
was...
that
there
was
securities
fraud
involved
there.
so
that's...
that
doesn't
distinguish
it.
the
fact
of
illegality
would
make
it
a
conspiracy,
but
it
doesn't
demonstrate
either
what
the...
what
the
association
in
fact
enterprise
is
and
what
are
its
affairs
that
are
distinguished
from
the
affairs
of
the
corporation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter,
because...
because
the...
it's
a
question
i
think
of
abstraction.
what
we
normally
do
is
hire
employees
and
review
their
applications.
now,
in
that
process,
we've
been
alleged
to
engage
in
illegal
acts
by
providing
them
with
false
identifications.
but
i
don't
see
how
that's
any
different
from
the
reves
situation
where
the
claim
is
that
you're
providing
ordinary
auditing
advice,
but
in
the
process
you're
lying.
you're
engaged
in
illegal
activities.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
precisely
the
same
problem
in
both
situations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
intentionally.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
justice
souter,
i
don't
doubt
that,
but
the
question
is
what
is
the
legal
standard
in
reves.
and
reves
doesn't
say,
did
you
engage
in
illegality,
and
reves
doesn't
say,
can
we
make
out
a
claim
of
conspiracy.
reves
says
what
you
have
to
demonstrate
is
that
you
are
conducting
or
directing
the
operations
or
affairs
of
some
entity,
apart
from
yourself.
and
here,
all
we're
doing
is
giving
id
cards
to
our
either
actual
or
potential
employees.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
still
doesn't
seem
to
me,
justice
souter,
to
satisfy
the
reves
standard,
which
is
not
just
that
there
has
to
be
something
more
than
conducting
your
own
affairs
immediately,
although
that's
important,
and
i
don't
think
that...
i
don't
think
you
can
show
that...
either
that
we
went
beyond
conducting
our
affairs
or
that
the
recruiters
went
beyond
conducting
their
affairs.
all
of
these
allegations
break
out
that
way.
but
what
reves
says
you
have
to
do
is
demonstrate
that
you
conducted
or
directed
the
affairs
of
whatever
this
association
in
fact
entity
is.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
that's
the
part
that's
missing.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
think
either
of
those--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
see,
under
those
circumstances,
i
wouldn't
have
any
problem
calling
mohawk
the
enterprise.
i
mean,
that's
the
whole
point
of
this.
the...
the
logical
enterprise
here
is
the
corporation.
the
question
is
do
you
go
beyond
that
to
create
these
completely
artificial
entities.
i
mean,
you
know,
this...
this
associational
enterprise
doesn't
exist
except
in
the
minds
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
it's
a
little
late
in
the
day,
justice
scalia,
because
that
is
precisely
the
standard
the
court
articulated
in
reves.
it
said
the
question
is
not
do
you...
are
you...
are
you
conducting
the
affairs
of
your
own
operation,
however
that's
defined.
but
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
need
to...
you
need
to
define.
i
mean,
you
know,
in
some
ways,
this
also
goes
to
why
it...
it's
a
mistake
to
get
into
this
in
the
first
place
because
if
you
just
said
it
has
to
be
individuals
associated
in
fact,
you
don't
have
to
get
into
any
of
this
inquiry.
you
could
obviate
the
need
to
evaluate
all
of
these
problems
in
one
fell
swoop.
but
even
assuming
that
you
still
want
to
live
in
this
world,
you
still...
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
identify
what
it
is...
what...
what
is
the
nature,
what
is
the
loose
organization
of
this
separate
enterprise,
and
then
what
are
its
functions.
and
then
you
have
to
evaluate
how
it
is
that
the
defendant
is,
in
fact,
operating
or
conducting
or
directing
the
affairs
of
that
enterprise.
and
that's
what's
missing,
justice
souter,
in...
in
footnote...
or
excuse
me...
in
paragraph
76
because
while
it
goes
to...
you
know,
it
says
we
paid
for
illegal
aliens
to
be
employed.
okay,
well,
that...
that's
clearly
hiring.
that's
the
first
one.
the
second
one
is
they
have
temp
agencies
and
they
pool
their
employees
and
they
loan
them
to
us
for
a
fee.
well,
that's
the
business
of
temp
agencies.
that's
what
they
do.
they
transport
employees
to...
so
they'll
have
them
available
in
their
pool.
that's
not...
we
don't
direct
any
of
that.
we...
we
are
their...
we
are...
it's
an
arms
length
deal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the...
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
according
to
the
allegation
in
paragraph
77,
it
just
says
obtaining
illegal
workers.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
providing
them
with
cover,
that
the
common
purpose
of
this
enterprise--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
paragraph
76.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
that's
a
factual
allegation.
but...
but
it...
but
all
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
because
what
you
still
need...
there's
still
a
higher...
it's
not
just
the
higher
threshold
that
it's
got
to
be
something
that
moves
beyond
what
the
corporation
does.
it
has
to
involve
the
direction
or
the
conduct
of
the
operation
of
a
separate
entity.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
obviously,
we're
going
to
disagree
about
this
i
think,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
i
think
the
bottom
line
is
what
we're
doing
is
when
the
applicant
shows
up
at
our
doorstep
or
when
they
have,
in
fact,
been
hired,
if
for...
and
this
is
the
allegation.
obviously,
none
of
this
is
true.
but
this
is
the
allegation.
that
we
then...
we
then
supply
those
employees...
our
employees
and
our
applicants
with
these
false
id's.
that's
part
of
the
process
of
our
own
hiring.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it...
the
allegation
certainly
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
only
one
sentence
in
the
allegation
that
even
remotely
says
anything
about
this.
and
again,
justice
souter,
the...
the
fundamental
assumption
here
is
that
if
there's
something
that
goes
anywhere
beyond
our
affairs,
that
that
by
itself
is
sufficient
to
take
you
out
of
reves.
and
what
i
would
argue
strenuously
is
that
what
reves
says
is
you
have
to
be
conducting
or
directing
the
operations
of
the
other
entity's
affairs.
and
providing
this
doesn't
conduct
or
direct
anything.
it
may...
it
may
be
conspiracy.
it
may
satisfy
some
interrelationship,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
gets
you
to
the
point
of
an
existing
enterprise.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
ginsburg,
let
me...
let
me
try
to
justify
having
this
issue
before
the
court.
first
of
all,
1292(b)
has
never
been
as
narrowly
confined
as
you
suggest,
and
indeed,
in
this
case,
you
know,
what
you're
entitled
to
do
is
to
bring
up
any
issues
related
to
the
challenged
order.
and
in
this
case
we
not
only
raise
the
rico
issue,
but
we
also
raised
state
law
issues
in
the...
in
the
eleventh
circuit
which
were
not
within
the
specific
grant
and
were
entertained
by
the
eleventh
circuit
because
that's
the
standard.
and
then
once
you
get
past
that,
justice
kennedy
is
absolutely
right.
the
issue
is
whether
there's
an
order
to
be
reviewed.
there
is
no
final
judgment
rule
on
claims
coming
out
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals,
and
therefore,
it's...
it's
absolutely
fair
game.
and
the
issue
is
i...
i
submit,
fairly
subsumed
within
the
question
presented.
justice
souter,
you
know,
with
respect
to
the
id
cards,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
that
for
us
to
do
our
business,
we
have
to
have
an
id
card
in
order
to
fill
out
the
forms
necessary
to
satisfy
the
immigration
laws.
so
that...
you
know,
those
id
cards
add
nothing
to
the...
to
the
conduct
of
our
business.
and,
you
know,
mr.
stewart
just
suggested
that,
well,
but
you
know,
we
do
go
beyond
that
and
that
h.j.
allows
some
a...
a
different
analysis
of
this
particular
point.
but
h.j.
preceded
reves.
this
court
held
in
reves
that
you
have
to
distinguish
between
the
activities
of
the
enterprise
and
the
activities
of
the
defendant
and...
and
they've
never
made
any
effort
to
do
that.
all
they
do
is
suggest
we've
engaged
in
wrongdoing,
that
our
third
party
recruiters
engaged
in
wrongdoing,
and
that
we're
a
conspiracy.
there's
nothing
in
there
that
remotely
suggests
that
there
is
an
existing
enterprise.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
how
to
interpret
this
particular
statute,
justice
scalia
is
absolutely
correct
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
this
is
at
most
an
ambiguous
provision,
and
if
it's
an
ambiguous
provision,
we
ought
to
be
entitled
to
the
rule
of
lenity.
i
didn't
hear
any
adequate
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
specific
question
about
why
do
they
use
person
in
the
subsection
just
ahead
of
it,
if
they
really
meant
to
embrace
everything
here.
and
it's
no
answer
to
say,
well,
enterprise
is
a
term
that
could
be...
that
has
a
general
background.
enterprise
is
the
linchpin
of
this
statute.
the
notion
that
congress
didn't
mean
to
very
specifically
and
explicitly
define
enterprise
here
is
absurd.
of
course,
it
defined
it,
and
it
provided
a
very
specific
and
detailed
definition.
and
it's
not
free
for
the
government
or
for
anyone
else
then
to
come
here
and
shunt
aside
that
definition
and
say,
well,
we're
just
going
to
deal
with
background
principles.
the
truth
is
they're
trying
to
write
out
of
it
groups
of
individuals
acting
in
association.
that
language
is
there.
it
was
put
there
for
a
reason.
the
government
concedes
that
it
didn't...
that
it
never...
that
congress
never
had
this
issue
in
mind.
how
it
can
be
then
that
this
is
not
at
least
sufficiently
ambiguous
that
you
should
construe
it
in
our
favor
strikes
me
as...
as
very
difficult
to
understand.
and
finally,
i
don't...
i've
never
heard
the
expression
ricoize
before,
justice
breyer,
but
i...
i
embrace
it
wholeheartedly
because
that
is
precisely
what
we're
talking
about
here.
these
are
enormous
penalties
that
are
imposed,
and
it's
a
statute
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
past,
even
on
its
own
terms,
is
very
broad.
certainly
there
is
no
reason
to
take
those
terms
and
ricoize
the...
the
breadth
of
corporate
activity
that
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
in
this
case
would...
would
allow.
the
court
should
reverse
the
decision
below
and
dismiss
this
complaint,
just
as
the
seventh
circuit
did.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honors.
