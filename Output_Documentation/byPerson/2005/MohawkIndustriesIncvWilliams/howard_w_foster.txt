mr.
howard
w.
foster
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
as
mr.
phillips
makes
quite
clear,
mohawk
does
not
like
the
way
the
plaintiffs
have
written
their
complaint
in
this
case.
he
would
prefer...
they
would
prefer
that
the
enterprise
be
mohawk
industries
and
certain
individuals
within
the
corporation
being
named
as
the
rico
persons.
but
the
plaintiffs
write
their
complaint
and
the
plaintiffs
are
the
master
of
their
complaint,
and
at
this
stage,
as
far
as
the
case
has
proceeded,
which
is
only
up
to
a
motion
to
dismiss,
that's
what
we
are
to
deal
with,
whether
this
states
a
cause
of
action
under
rico.
there
seems
to
be
no
dispute
in
the
lower
courts
that
corporations
can
form
associations
of
fact
with
other
entities
and
that
a
corporation
can
be
a
person
conducting
the
affairs
of
such
an
entity.
we
have
alleged
that
here.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
actually
the
term...
the
definition
of
enterprise
in
rico
starts
with
the
word
includes
and
it
also
states
any
union
or
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact,
though
not
a
legal
entity.
the
word
union
is
not
defined.
according
to
mohawk,
union
should
be
interpreted
to
mean
a
labor
union,
but
that
makes
no
sense
structurally
because
the
first
part
of
that
definition
includes
legal
entities,
and
if
reference
were
being
made
by
congress
to
a
labor
union,
then
the
union
would
have
been
inserted
in
that
part
of
it
because
at
the
time
rico
was
written
in
1970,
congress
had
already
enacted
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1946,
which
made
labor
unions
suable
entities.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
i
don't
think
it's
an
exhaustive
list,
justice
alito.
it...
the
court
has
held
in
previous
cases
that
rico
used
concepts
and
terms
of
breadth.
this
would
appear
to
be
that,
as
the
court
said
in
both
h.j.
v.
northwestern,
russello,
and
turkette.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
i...
i
don't
think
so.
i
believe
that
the
way
includes
is
actually
used,
for
example,
in
the
definition
of
attorney
general,
opens
a
long
definition
which
is
itself
exhaustive,
but
leaves
room
for
change.
attorney
general
was
written
in
a
way
that
allowed
any
official
to
be
designated
by
the
attorney
general
to
fall
within
that
description.
there's
room
for
designations
and
there's
room
for
change
in
the
justice
department
as
it
occurs
over
time.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
yes.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
well,
i
think
union
is...
it
says
union
or
group
of
individuals.
i
think
union
is
something--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--i
would...
justice
scalia,
i
don't
believe
that
union
means
labor
union
because--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--if
it
meant
a
labor
union
there--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--a
union
or
group
of
individuals.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
well,
the
word
individual
is
not
defined
in
the
statute
either,
and--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--the
enterprise
alleged
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
actually
not
a
single
corporation.
that
first
list
would
not
encompass
a
group
of
corporations.
a
group
of
corporations
is
actually
not
a
single
legal
entity.
it's
a
group
of
legal
entities
that
have
combined
to
commit
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
it
doesn't
neatly
fit
into
the
first
definition,
which
seems
to
encompass
only
single
entities.
and
so
every
single
circuit
court
in
the...
in
the
country
to
examine
this
question
has
held
that
congress
didn't
expect,
anticipate,
or
intend
to
exclude
groups
of
legal
entities
from
being...
being
a...
a
rico
enterprise.
they
were
captured
by
the
second
part
of
the
definition.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
well,
the
use
of
the
word
union
or
group
of
individuals
seems
to
broaden
it.
the
word
includes
at
the
beginning
of
the
definitional
section
broadens
it
even
further.
as
this
court
held
in
footnote
14
of
the...
in
the
sedima
decision,
the
use
of
the
word
requires
in
that
definitional
section
was
key
to
understanding
what
it
meant,
and
it
said
requires,
in
terms
of
pattern,
meant
more
than
simply
two
predicate
acts.
the
word
requires
had
to
mean
more,
and
it
had
to
be
read
in
context.
we
think
that
this
should
read
in
context.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
yes.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
well,
i
agree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
think
the
court
should
entertain
the
question
at
all.
and--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--we
are
reviewing
a
ruling--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--it's
a
ruling.
we're
not
reviewing
a
final
judgment.
all
it
is
is
a
ruling.
it
came
to
this
court
and
the
question
that
this
court
accepted
for
certiorari
has
actually
been...
all
but
abandoned.
mr.
phillips
hardly
used
the
word
agent
at
all,
if
at
all.
he
doesn't
argue
why
his
rule
about
distinctness
should
be
applied
here.
there
is
no
allegation
or
he
doesn't
make
any
legal
argument
that
the
members
of
this
association
in
fact
enterprise
should
be
deemed
to
be
agents
of
mohawk.
that's
not
alleged
in
the
complaint.
that's
not
the
way
the
complaint
was
written.
they're
all
alleged
to
be
separate
legal
entities.
they're...
for
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage,
that
is
enough
to
satisfy
this
court's
requirement
in
cedric
kushner
that
the
members
of
an
enterprise
be
distinct
from--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--rico
does
add
more.
it
can't
be
a
mere
criminal
conspiracy
to
commit
a
single
crime.
there
needs
to
be
an
association
of
entities
that
associate
over
a
considerable
period
of
time
to
meet
either
closed
ended
continuity
or
open
ended
and
commit
a
pattern
of
criminal
acts
that
are
related
to
each
other,
that
go
on
for--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--they
hired...
and
the
association
itself,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
have
to
exist
over
a...
a
significant
period
of
time.
there
would
have
to
be...
there's
this
durational
element--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--yes.
normal
contractual
relationship
is
not
to
commit
a
felony,
and
if--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--yes.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
and
then
we
have
the
pattern
and
the
durational
aspect
of
it.
and
it
has
to
affect
interstate
commerce...
the
enterprise
does...
and
in
order
to
have
a
civil
cause
of
action--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
rico
enterprise
among...
is
a
conspiracy
to
commit
crime,
but
it's
conspiracy
plus.
the
plus
is--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--the
plus
is
more
than
one
act.
there
has
to
be
a
pattern.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
there
would
have
to
be
at
least
two,
and
there
would...
it
would
have
to
go
on
to
meet
the
court's
pattern
requirement.
two
generally
is
held
not
to
be
enough
if
it's
a
closed
period
of
time
that's
over.
but
this
complaint
alleges
an
open
period,
and
two
would
be
enough,
coupled
with
the
allegation
that
this
is
the
normal
way
for
the
company
to
conduct
its
business.
mr.
howard
w.
foster
it's
because
we
have
a
joint
venture
of
entities
operating
over
a
long
period
of
time
that
have
victimized
a
large
number
of
people,
and
there's
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
and--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--they
hired
more
than
one.
in
fact,
the
statute
requires
10
in
a
12-month
period.
so
there
would
actually
have
to
be
10
for
at
least
2
years.
so
that
would
mean
at
least
20
illegal
aliens
have
to
have
been
hired
under
the
1324
section
that's
alleged
in
this
complaint.
and
probably
for
more
than
2
years
or
an
ongoing
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
and
a
person
has
to
have
been
proximately
harmed
by
a
predicate
act
in
order
to
assert
a
civil
cause
of
action.
beyond
that,
there
is
the...
of
course,
the
requirement
of
reves
that
the
person...
and
here
the
corporation
is
participating
in
the
affairs
or
conducting
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise.
and--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--here,
justice
scalia,
there
is,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier
in
the
dialogue
with
justice
souter,
a
very
close
cooperation
among
mohawk
and
these
third
parties
to
get
workers,
to
bring
them
from--
mr.
howard
w.
foster
--yes,
i
agree.
and
i
would
contend
that
there
is
enough
factual
detail
and
a
description
of
the
claim
asserted
in
this
complaint
to
satisfy
rule
8
to
state
a
claim.
and
the
type
of
factual
inquiry
that
mohawk
has
suggested,
that
mr.
phillips
has
suggested,
saying,
for
example,
their
test
that
mohawk
cannot
be
participating
in
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise
that
involves
hiring
because
it
itself
involves
hiring
would
dramatically
change
the
interpretation
of
rico.
it
would
mean
that,
for
example,
a
drug
dealer
could
not
participate
in
a
drug
enterprise
because
he
does
what
the
enterprise
does.
since
all
corporations
are
engaged
in
hiring
activities,
therefore,
then
no
corporation
or
other
business
entity
could
ever
be
prosecuted
or
sued
under
rico
because
that...
there
is
overlap
between
what
they
do
and
what
an
enterprise
does,
the...
if
the
enterprise
is
devoted
to
recruiting
illegal
workers
for
a
business.
that
just
can't
be
what
congress
had
in
mind,
and
it's
not
consistent
with
what
this
court
held
in
turkette
that
a
common
purpose
is
required
for
there
to
be
a
rico
enterprise.
in
conclusion,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
should
address
mohawk's
first
point.
i
thought
it
was
startling
to
return
to
that
issue,
that
mr.
phillips
stated
the
reason
that
it
was
not
raised
below
was
because
he
knew
that
they
would
lose
and
eleventh
circuit
would
rule
against
them.
but,
nevertheless,
he
wishes
it
to
be
addressed
by
this
court
and
simply
bypass
the
court
of
appeal
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
if
there's
no
split
below,
then
the
question
would
not
have
been
accepted
for
cert
presumably,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
and
it
should
not
be
entertained
now.
for
the
reasons
stated,
i
believe
that
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
