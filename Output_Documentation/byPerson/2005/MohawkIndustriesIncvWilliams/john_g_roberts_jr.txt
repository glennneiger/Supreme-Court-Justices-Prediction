chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
mohawk
industries
v.
williams.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
unless
somebody
raises
it.
unless
somebody
raises
it
below
to
preserve
it
for
the
hearing
en
banc
or...
or
some
other
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so...
so
that
if
you
charged--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
that
if
you
charged
the
workers,
you
know,
$10
for
their
fake
id
cards,
you
think
that
would
be
a
different
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
there,
that's...
there,
you...
you...
there's
a
separate
enterprise
basically
selling
id
cards,
and
that's
not
part
of
mohawk's
business.
but
if
you're
just
hiring
them
the
way
you
hire
other
employees,
illegally
as
it's
alleged,
that's
mohawk's
enterprise
if
there's
some
separate
illegal
activity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
foster.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
may
be
no
dispute
about
it,
but
it
does
seem
kind
of
strange
to
encompass
them
under
the
term
individuals
when
the
same
statute
uses
individuals
and
corporations
separately.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
not
defined
in
the
statute,
but
the
prior
list
in
the
same
sentence
says
individual,
partnership,
corporation.
so
you
assume
whatever
an
individual
is
it's
different
than
a
corporation
or
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
say
corporation
again.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
there
different
about
your
proceeding
to
treat
this
as
a
rico
enterprise
that
isn't
covered
by
normal
corporate
criminal
conspiracy
law?
what
does
rico
add
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
hire
more
than
one
person.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that
different
than
a
normal
contractual
relationship
that
a
corporation
is
going
to
have
with
any
number
of
suppliers,
vendors,
agents?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
i'm
trying
to
see
what
rico
adds
to
the
normal
conspiracy
law--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
would
otherwise
be
applicable.
so
we're
assuming
that
the
arrangement
is
there
and
that
they're
engaging
in
illegal
activity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
congress
didn't...
to
be
fair,
congress
did
not
enact
rico
because
it
was
concerned
that
criminal
conspiracy
law,
applied
to
corporations,
didn't
adequately
touch
interstate
commerce.
the
whole
point
is
that
they
had
something
significantly
different
in
mind,
and
your
allegations
in
the
complaint
seem
to
be
fully
met
by
application
of
criminal
conspiracy
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
give
you
a
chance
to
explain
why
this
looks
like
rico
rather
than
just
criminal
conspiracy.
and
you've
come
up
and
you
said
interstate
commerce.
there's
got
to
be
more
than
one.
well,
none
of
that
really
suggests
a
distinction.
what...
what
is
it
that
makes
this
a
rico
case
rather
than
just
a
criminal
conspiracy
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
a
pattern
because
they
hired
more
than
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
and
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
also
this
morning,
we
decide
two
argued
cases
in
per
curiam
opinions.
in
04-1131,
whitman
versus
department
of
transportation,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit
is
vacated,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
in
05-465,
mohawk
industries
versus
williams,
the
writ
of
certiorari
we
previously
granted
limited
to
question
1
presented
by
the
petition
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted;
however,
today,
we
now
grant
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
judgment
is
vacated,
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
11th
circuit
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
our
decision
just
announced
in
anza
versus
ideal
steel
supply
corporation.
