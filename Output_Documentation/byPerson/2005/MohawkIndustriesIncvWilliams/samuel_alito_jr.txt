but
why
would
they
use
includes
in
that
provision
and
means
in
other
provisions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
do
you
agree
that
that's
an
exhaustive
list
in
subsection
(4)?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
would
you
agree
that
includes
is
meant
to
be
exhaustive
in
many
of
the
other...
in
a
number
of
the
other
subsections
of
this
definitional
provision?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
shouldn't
includes
here
be
read
to
mean
means
when
that
seems
to
be
the
way
it's
used
in
other
subsections
of
this
provision
and
when
the
only
thing
that
seems
to
be...
if
this
is
not
an
exhaustive
list,
the
only
thing
that
seems
possibly
to
be
omitted
from
the
list
is
what's
involved
here,
which
is
a
group
consisting
of
a
corporation
or
other
legal...
other
legal
entity
and...
and
natural
persons.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
a
state
attorney...
a
state
attorney
general
wouldn't
fall
within
subsection
10.
would...
would
that
be
the
case?
