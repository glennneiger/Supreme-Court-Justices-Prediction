suppose
we
get
through
that.
i
see
the
artificial
part.
just
what
is
it?
piling
pelion
on
something
or
other.
mountains
that
you
pile
one
on
top
of
the
other.
but
your
opponents
have
cited
in
your
brief...
in
the
brief
on
page
12
that
counsel
for
mohawk
said
to
the
court,
specifically,
mohawk
agrees
that
a
corporation
can
be
both
a
rico
person
and
part
of
an
association
in
fact
enterprise.
now,
if
we
can
overcome
all
these
other
problems--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
do
we
do
about
that
particular
concession?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what...
what
sense
would
it
make
on
the
merits
to
get
your
interpretation
on
the
merits,
which
would
mean,
i
guess,
that
five
individuals
could
be
an
enterprise
because
that's
a
group
of
individuals.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
five
labor
unions
couldn't.
five
corporations
couldn't.
one
individual
and
four
labor
unions
couldn't.
one
individual
and
four
corporations
couldn't.
one
individual
and
three
partnerships
couldn't.
and...
but
what...
what
sense
would
that
make?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
if
we're
trying
to
think
of
what
they
were
getting
at,
it's
possible
that
congress
was
worried
about
organized
crime
taking
over
the
pizza
parlor
or
taking
over
a
trades
union
or
taking
over
a
similar
kind
of
enterprise.
so
that's
what
they're
thinking
about.
now,
if
we're
thinking
about
that,
they
put
in
the
word
groups
of
individuals
because
they
understand
that
organized
crime
could
take
over
a
group
of
individuals.
now,
once
you
do
that,
you
ricoize
vast
amounts
of
conspiracy
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're...
you're
willing
to
go
this
far
with
them.
you
say
take
those
words,
groups
of
individuals,
and
throw
them
away.
and
you're
saying
after
we
throw
them
away,
they're
still
covered,
and
the
reason
that
they're
still
covered
is
even
though
the
word
enterprise
includes
any
individual,
partnership,
corporation,
the
word
enterprise
also
includes
groups
of
legal
entities,
groups
of
trades
unions,
groups
of
associations,
even
without
that
word
group
of
individuals.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
is
there
any
indication
in
the
legislative
history
or
anywhere
else
in
the
statute
that
this
meaning
of
the
word
enterprise
is
what
is
intended,
that
is,
that
this
meaning
of
the
word
enterprise
went
beyond
what
it
says
here,
excluding
group
of
individuals?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
there
any
dissents
in
any
of
those
cases?
