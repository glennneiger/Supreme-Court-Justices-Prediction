justice
david
h.
souter
and
don't
they
do
that
by...
don't
the
allegations
do
that
here
by
claiming
that
the
corporation
was
manufacturing
or
providing
false
social
security
cards
and
was
giving
aid
to
the
immigrants
if
the...
the
law
got
too
close
to
them?
i
mean,
that
is
not
merely
the
conduct
by
a
corporation
of
the
normal
business
of
hiring
and
employing
people.
isn't
that
the
sort
of
extra
that
is
alleged
that
takes
this
out
simply
of
the...
of
the
category
of
the...
of
the
corporation
conducting
its
own
affairs?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
thrust
of
the
allegation.
i
thought
the
thrust
of
the
allegation
was
that
mohawk
was
acting
illegally
in
providing
phony
social
security
cards.
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't...
doesn't
that
get
them
at
least
to...
through
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
doesn't
it
at
least
get
them
to
summary
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in...
in
reves...
and
if...
and...
and
you...
you
may
well
correct
me
on
this
because
i'm...
i'm...
my
memory
is
not
precise.
but
i
thought
in
reves,
in
effect,
what
they
did
was
to
lie
in
the
course
of
doing
the
sort
of
the
thing
that
they
normally
do.
here,
the
allegation
is
that
they
were
doing
something,
providing
phony
id's,
that
employers
don't
normally
do.
isn't...
and,
you
know,
maybe
that's
a
fine
line,
but
is...
is
it
not
a
fine
enough
line
to
get
it
out
of
reves
and
get
it
beyond
the
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
is...
there
is
a
common
element
of
illegality,
but
the
distinction
is
that
in
reves,
you're
supposed
to
be
providing
these
services,
making
out
statements,
et
cetera,
and
you
put
the
wrong
numbers
in
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
whereas
in...
in
this
case,
an
employer
does
not
normally
go
about
providing
phony
id's
or
any
id's
for
the
people
it
hires.
it
says,
who
are
you?
what's
your
social
security
number?
and...
and
there's...
there's
an
affirmative
act
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
in...
in...
yes,
but
you're
doing
it
in
connection
with
a...
a
joint
recruitment
activity.
in
other
words,
the...
the
agencies
that
you
hire
to
get
the
workers
up
to
the
door
are
not
going
to
succeed
very
well
if...
if
all
the
workers
are
going
to
arrive
without
any
papers
and
without
any...
any
indication
like
a
social
security
card
and
so
on
that
they
can
be
part
of...
of
the
legal
work
force.
so
there's...
there's
something
extra
being
done
both
by
the...
the
recruiters
and
by
you,
and
the
extra,
in
effect,
is
a...
a
scheme
to
provide
phony
id's
that
suggest
that
these
people
are...
are
lawful
rather
than...
than
unlawful
immigrants.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
i
still
think
sooner
or
later
we
have
to
come
back
to
something
that
you
and
i
went
over
a
moment
ago,
and
that
is
the...
one
function,
maybe
the
function,
of...
of
the...
of
the...
the
entity
claimed
here
is...
is
providing
cover
for
the
illegal
status
of
the
aliens.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
at
least
a
bare
claim
here
that
mohawk
is
directing
the
affairs
or
the
business
of...
of
this
third
entity--
justice
david
h.
souter
--by...
by
the
way
that
it
is...
allegedly
provides
phony
social
security
cards.
justice
david
h.
souter
where...
where
do
we...
you're
going
to
have
to
help
me
out
then.
where...
where
in
the...
the
pleadings
or
the...
the
papers
do
we
get
into
the
social...
do
we
get
the
allegations
of
the
social
security
card?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
factual
allegation,
as
a
bare
matter,
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
objection
that
you
raise,
that
something
more
than
merely
the
activity...
the
conduct
of...
of
their
separate
business
is
going
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if...
if,
in
fact,
it
is
the
case
that
mohawk
is...
is
providing
the
social
security
cards,
isn't
it
directing
the
means
by
which
the
third...
the
third
entity
is,
in
effect,
illegally...
or
supplying
illegal
workers
in...
in
this...
this
joint
enterprise?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
reasonable...
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose,
on
the
basis
of
reading
the
allegations
as
they
have
to
be
read
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding...
is
it
reasonable
to
infer
that...
from
the
allegation
that
there
is
an
understanding
between
mohawk
and
the
employment
agencies
that
mohawk
will
provide
this
documentation
and
therefore
make
the
scheme
work?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
say
that
in
any...
any
black
letter
statement.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
isn't
the
plus
simply
more
than
one
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so...
no,
but
i
mean
literally.
as...
as
long
as...
as
two
illegal
workers
are
going
to
be
hired,
isn't
that
sufficient
to
convert...
to
go
from
conspiracy
to...
to
rico
on
your
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
they
had
no
reason
whatsoever
for
doing
the
same
thing
for
what
we
have
are
associations
of
trade
unions
with
each
other
or
associations
of...
of
corporations
with
each
other.
and
to
do
that,
adding
that
in
when
it
doesn't
say
that,
would
ricoize,
with
its
treble
damages
and
private
plaintiffs
and
everything,
vast
amounts
of
ordinary
commercial
activity,
not
ordinary
only
in
that,
but
importantly,
a
certain
amount
of
criminal
activity
like
passing
bad
checks
or
fraudulent
behavior
is
involved.
but
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
to...
that
has
not
to
do
with
organized
crime.
that
does
not
have
to
do
with
taking
over
legitimate
enterprises.
so
read
this,
i
think
he's
saying,
to
mean
what
it
says
most
naturally.
they're
worried
about
groups
of
individuals.
they're
not
worried
about
groups
of
corporations
or
groups
of
trade
unions
interacting
with
each
other.
and
i'm
trying
to
put
the
argument
the
other
way,
and
i
wanted
see
what
you
respond.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
any
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
deal
specifically
with
the
peculiarity
of
this
definition
in
which,
although
it
starts
out
with
the
word
includes,
then
follows
a...
a
listing,
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
and
then
it
repeats
one,
but
only
one,
of
the
items
on
the
list
and
says
groups
of
these
items,
i.e.,
individuals,
are
included?
that's
the
peculiarity
of
the
definition.
do
any
of
the
courts
of
appeals
come
to
grips
with
that?
