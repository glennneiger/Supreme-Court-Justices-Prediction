justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe
congress
didn't
assume
that.
they
probably
didn't
think
about
it.
but
what's
wrong
with
the
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
that
exactly
the...
what
the
act
does?
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
they
passed
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--how--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
what
do
you...
here's
the
problem
that
i
have,
particularly
at
the
stage
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
with
that
argument.
the...
they're...
the
convention
also
includes
that
provision
that
its
terms
will
be
defined,
enforced,
and
so
on,
in
harmony,
or
conformity,
with
the
domestic
law
of
the
signatory.
our
domestic
law
includes
rfra.
that
would
seem
to
open
the
door
for,
in
effect,
a
rfra
exception.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
let
me...
let
me
just
finish
my...
let
me
get
to
my...
let
me
get
to
my
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--before
you
answer
it.
[laughter]
my...
the
particular
concern
i
have
with
that,
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
is
not
necessarily
that
that
particular
argument
should,
for
all
times,
be
assessed
correctly
by
the...
by
the
district
court.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
district
court
at
least
plausibly
reads
that
exception
to
negate
your
argument,
isn't
that
good
enough,
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
as
a
basis
for
the
court
saying,
"look,
you
haven't...
you,
the
government...
haven't
carried
your
burden
to
show
the
affirmative
defense
here?
"
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is,
there's
no
question.
but
we're
still
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
the
respondent
bear
the
burden?
you
have
the
burden--
justice
david
h.
souter
--under
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
i
realize
that...
could
we
pause
on
that
for
a
second?
because
you
apparently
take
the
position...
the
government
takes
the
position
that
when...
under
the
governing
law,
the
government
would
have
an
affirmative
burden,
ultimately,
to
defend...
in
this
case,
on
compelling
interest,
least
restrictive,
et
cetera...
that,
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
the
applicant
for
the
injunction
has
the
burden
to
negate
the
probability
that
the
government
will
carry
its
burden
on
the
ultimate
issue.
and
i
don't
see
why
that
should
be
so
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
let--
justice
david
h.
souter
--just--
justice
david
h.
souter
--go
through--
justice
david
h.
souter
--get
to
the
convention--
justice
david
h.
souter
--later.
get
to
the
general...
first
get
to
the
general
issue.
does
the
applicant
for
the
injunction
have
the
burden
to
negate
the
probability
that
the
government
will
prevail
in
its
affirmative
defense,
ultimately?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
convention--
justice
david
h.
souter
--issue
goes
directly
to
your
affirmative
defense.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say...
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
you
want
to
reserve
your
time.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--solution
that
includes
the
substance
dmt
is
covered,
by
definition,
as
i
understand
it.
tea
is
a
solution,
and
it
includes
dmt.
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
wrong...
can
you
tell
me,
on
the
face
of
it,
what's
wrong
with
it?
i
mean,
i...
if
i
have
tea
at
5
o'clock,
i
think
i'm
drinking
a
solution
that
includes
the
little
things
that
come
out
of
the
tea
leaves.
and
that's
what
we've
got
involved
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
tell
me
what's
wrong
with
the
analysis
of
the
solution?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--saying
that
there
are...
there's
basically
an
ambiguity
in
the
treaty,
that
solutions
derived
from
plants
are
not
covered,
but
solutions
that
include
dmt
are
covered,
and
there...
therefore,
there
is
a
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
solution
is
defined
by
the
number
of
steps
in
the
process
that
gets
the
substance
into
the
water?
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i'm
not
blaming
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--for
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--say
yes.
let
me
him
make
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
the
compelling
interest
in
enforcing
it
against
the
aggrieved
person.
isn't
that
what
you
mean?
