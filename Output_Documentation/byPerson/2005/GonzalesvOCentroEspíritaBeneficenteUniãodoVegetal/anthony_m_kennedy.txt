justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
your
position
is
that
you
must...
we
must
give
controlling
determinative
weight
to
the
fact
that
it's
listed
in
schedule
1.
and
the
respondents
say
you
don't
give
it
any
weight
at
all,
it's
all
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
is
there
a
middle
ground
that
there...
which
i
think
would
allow
you
to
prevail
here...
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
there
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
when
it's
in
schedule
1?
it's
a
rebuttable
presumption,
but
it's
a
presumption
that,
when
it's
in
schedule
1,
it's
a
compelling
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
part
of
the
statute
is
sherbert
and
verner
and
the
test
that
congress
says
we
have
to
apply
to
its
acts
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
stay
on
this
point,
because
it's
important,
but
if
this
were
a
schedule
2
substance,
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
your
briefs--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--indicate,
or
does
the
record
indicate,
that
the
government
was
foreclosed
from
presenting
any
evidence
it
wanted
to
present?
if
you,
for
some
reason,
go
back,
and
this
whole
thing
is
done
again,
whether
they...
is
there
important
additional
evidence
for
you
to
introduce,
or
do
we
essentially
have
the
case
in
front
of
us,
so
far
as
you're
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
understand
the
broader
point,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
seem
to
give
the
fact
that
it's
listed
in
schedule
1
zero
weight.
it
seems
to
me,
at
the
very
least,
there
should
be
a
presumption
that
this
is
a
compelling
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
when
the...
and
when
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise,
as
the
district
judge
thought
it
would,
that
presumption,
it
seems
to
me,
carries
the
day
for
the
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
surely--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--surely
rfra
doesn't
say
that
you
disregard
treaties
or
you
disregard
statutes
in
determining
what's
a
compelling
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
getting
back
to
the
first
question
that
justice
breyer
asked...
and
then
we
got
off
on
what
the
treaty
really
means...
but
assuming
that
the
treaty
does
prohibit
the
importation
of
this
substance...
assuming
that...
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
district
court
thought
that
this
was
a
compelling
interest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
none
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
treaty,
then
the
appellate
court's
opinion
doesn't
really
even
address
the
point
whether
or
not
this
and/or
the
statute,
together,
can
be
a
compelling
interest.
