ms.
nancy
hollander
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
government's
position
here,
that
the
court
should
completely
defer
to
congress's
generalized
finding
to
wholly
exempt
schedule
1
of
controlled
substances
act
from
rfra's
mandate
is
fundamentally
and
structurally
incompatible
with
rfra.
ms.
nancy
hollander
yes,
your
honor,
and--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--your
honor,
the
district
court...
we
give
it
deference,
as
did
the
district
court.
judge
parker
specifically
found,
contrary
to
what
the
government
says,
that
he
began
by
looking
at
schedule
1,
and
he
specifically
says...
i
believe
it's
on
page
212(a)
of
the
petitioner's
appendix...
that
he
had
to
begin
there.
and
he
said,
"this
court
must
give
due
regard
for
the
fact
that
congress
put
dmt
into
schedule
1.
"
but
then
he
applied
rfra.
and
in
applying
rfra,
he
went
on
to
apply
rfra
and
to
specifically
find
that
applying
rfra,
which
requires
not
only
a
compelling
interest,
but
a
compelling
interest
to
the
person,
that
the
government
did
not
meet
its
burden
in
this
case
of
showing
harm,
any
risk
of
harm,
to
these
members,
or
any
risk
of
diversion.
and
i'd
like
to
go
back,
for
a
moment,
to
the
issue
of
peyote,
because,
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
the
congressional
record
in
1965,
for
what
that's
worth,
there's
not
one
mention...
and
it's
on
page...
starts
on
page
480
of
the
joint
appendix...
there's
no
mention
of
indian
tribes,
there's
no
mention
of
sovereign
issues
with
the
indian
tribes.
there's
a
mention
of
the
native
american
church
and
the
first
amendment
and
why
this
exemption
has
to
be
made.
and,
in
fact,
our
record
is--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--yes,
sir,
we
do,
your
honor.
we
know
that.
and
it
is
throughout
our
brief.
there's
many
mentions
of
it,
the
fact
that
there
have
been
non
native
american
members
since
the
beginning
of
the
native
american
church.
i
would
direct
the
court
to
the
easiest
one,
which
is
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
500,
which
is
a
memo
from
a
dea
legal
counsel
talking
about
this.
and,
in
fact,
at
the
hearing
in
our
case,
on
the
very
last
day...
it
was
on
november
2nd,
2001,
at
page
1933...
mr.
adam
zubin,
representing
the
government,
specifically
said,
and
i
quote,
"the
federal
government
places
no
restrictions
on
who
can
participate
in
the
native
american
church.
"
so,
we
have
two
things.
we
have
the
exemption
in
1965--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--your
honor,
it
would
depend,
again,
on
the
facts
of
that
case.
ms.
nancy
hollander
the
distinctions...
yes
and
no,
and
let
me
explain,
your
honor...
mr.
chief
justice...
the
distinction
is
that
if
the
government
could
meet
a
compelling
interest
and
actually
show
a
risk
of
diversion--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that
they--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--showed
it--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--then
they
would
have
different
facts.
and
the
different
facts
in
that
case
would
mean
that,
in
that
case,
the
government
would
win.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out,
although
i
realize
you've
just
presented
me
with
a
hypothetical...
however,
there
are
250,000
members
of
the
native
american
church,
and
the
record
in
our
case
is
that
there's
never
been
any
evidence
of
any
diversion.
and,
although
the
government
has--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't,
because,
again,
the
government
has...
we
have
to
look
at
the
treaty,
just
like
we
look
at
any
other
law...
rfra
clearly
says--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--it
may...
yes,
your
honor--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--it
may
be
a
compelling
interest,
but
it
still
may
not
satisfy
rfra,
because
rfra
specifically
requires
that
it
be
a
compelling
interest
to
the
person.
and
we...
the
government
would
have
to
put
on
evidence.
and
even
though
is
a
question
of
law,
that
doesn't
preclude
the
district
court
hearing
evidence
which
he
has
not
heard
at...
to
this
point...
put
on
evidence
showing
that
the...
that
the
compelling
interest
the
government
has
asserted
in
this
case,
which
is
that
it
would
lose
its
leadership
position
in
the
international
community,
would
really
be
a
compelling
interest,
and
that
it
could
not
be
accommodated.
ms.
nancy
hollander
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
your
honor.
the...
what's
wrong
with
that
is
that
rfra
requires
the
government
to
go
further
than
that.
ms.
nancy
hollander
if
the
treaty
does
include
hoasca,
which
we
believe
that
it
doesn't.
ms.
nancy
hollander
why
doesn't
it?
it
doesn't.
and
the...
and,
interestingly,
the
executive
took
the
reverse
position
that
it's
taking
here
throughout
the
history
of
this
treaty
until
this
litigation,
and
it
doesn't
cover
hoasca,
because
it
doesn't
cover
plants,
or
infusions
from
plants.
and
that
is
the
position.
and
the
reason
why
the
u.s.
would
not
lose
its
leadership
position
is
that
that's
the
position
of
brazil,
which
allows
religious
use--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--the
treaty...
we
have
to
rely,
your
honor,
on
the
treaty
as
a
whole.
and
what--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--what
the--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--the
treaty
that
the...
the
language
that
suggests
that
exception
is,
first
of
all,
in
article
32,
that
talks
about
the
traditional
use
of
plants.
it
is
in
the
fact
that
plants
are
not
covered.
and
so,
a--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--preparation--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--no,
your
honor,
it
isn't.
and
the
reason
it
isn't
is,
if
we
look...
several
places,
one
is
the
conduct
of
our
treaty
partners,
none
of
whom
agree
with
that
position...
we
look
at--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--well,
your
honor,
if
they
are,
then
we
are,
also--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--because--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--the--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--i
was--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--in
the
treaty.
ms.
nancy
hollander
i
was--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--i--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--i
was...
i
was
trying
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question.
but
let
me
say
this.
and
of
course
i
would
read
the
language
of
the
commentary
and
the
incb
and
the
opinion
of
our
former
ambassador,
herbert
okun,
in
brazil
and
france.
but
let
me
also
say,
if
i
may,
that
the
position
of
the
executive,
until
this...
until
this
litigation,
has
been
the
same.
and
the
reason
we
know
that
is
precisely
what
you
said,
your
honor.
mescaline
is
also
covered
by
the
treaty.
peyote
is
not.
the
native--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--american--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
did
make
a
special
reservation,
but
it
didn't
matter
yet,
because
it's
never
been
covered.
that
reservation,
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
what
the
senate
said
at
the
time,
and
what...
there
are
no
plants.
they're
just
not
listed
in
the
treaty.
they
purpose
of
the
reservation
was,
in
an
abundance
of
caution,
in
case
it
would
be...
in
case
it
would
be
added
in
the
future,
then
plants,
and
solutions
from
plants,
would
be
covered.
but
as
it
stands
now,
members
of
the
native
american
church
drink
a
tea
containing
peyote
and--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--mescaline.
ms.
nancy
hollander
the...
yes,
the
ambiguity
arises
because
what
the
treaty
means
is
that
if
you
were
to
extract
the
dmt
and
then
add
it
to
something,
which
can't
be
done
here
and
could
have
no
religious
meaning
for
the
udv,
and
we're
not
even
sure
if...
chemically,
if
it's
possible.
if
you
were
to
extract
it
and
then
add
it,
then
you
would
have
a
solution
containing
dmt.
and
that's--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--well--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--your
honor,
i
didn't
write
this
treaty,
and
i...
and
i
must
say--
[laughter]
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that
it--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that
it--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that
it--
[laughter]
it's
not
the
clear...
the
clearest
writing,
but
we
know...
we
know
what
its
meaning
is,
and
we
do
have
to
look
at
the
travaux,
which
goes
into
long
detail
about
why
they
even
mention
plants,
because
of
their
fear,
in
the
future,
that
plants
might
be
covered.
now,
other
plants
are
covered--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--in
a
different
treaty.
but--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--yes.
[laughter]
i'm
just
waiting.
ms.
nancy
hollander
i'm
just
trying--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--to
be
polite.
ms.
nancy
hollander
yes,
it
can,
your
honor.
it
can
trump
the
treaty,
and
that...
and
that
is--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--correct.
ms.
nancy
hollander
it
is
not.
and...
but
we
don't
even
have
to
go
that
far,
because,
if
we
do
the
rfra
analysis,
the
government
must
show
a
compelling
interest
to
the
person
and,
in
addition--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--the--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--no.
you
don't
disregard
them,
your
honor,
but--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--well,
the...
no,
the
district
court--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--analyzed
the
treaty
differently,
and
analyzed
the
treaty
to
not
apply
to
hoasca,
for
all
the
reasons
that
are...
that
are
in
his
opinion
in
our
brief.
and,
therefore--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that's
correct.
if
you
disagree
with
the
district
court
on
that,
then
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
it
to...
for
additional--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that's
true.
and--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--the
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
no
dmt
extracted
in
this
case.
although
the
government
said
that
in
their
brief,
there
is
no
evidence
of
that,
and
it
is
contrary
to
the
evidence--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--no,
mr.
chief--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--the
tea
is
imported.
but
the--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--but
the
tea
is
made
just
like
you
would
make
tea
if
you
mixed
chamomile
and
mint,
and
then--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--and
then
you
took
the
leaves
out.
what
you
have--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--in
that
tea
is
a
collection
of
a
tremendous
number
of
alkaloids.
and
what
the
commentary
is
saying
is
that
you
would
have
to
pull
this
alkaloid
out.
and
that
would
be
a
chemical
process.
there's
further...
there's
further--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that's
correct.
however,
under
the
treaty,
it's
not...
it's
not
covered
by
the
treaty,
because
it
is
not
separate.
if
dmt
were
separated,
then
it
would
be
covered
by
the
treaty.
and,
actually,
if
you
look
at
the
1988
treaty,
going
even
farther,
and
its
commentary,
the
commentary
in
the
1988
treaty,
which
has
to
be
read
in
connection
with
the
1971
treaty,
specifically
defines
preparation
as
the
extraction--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--of
the
drug.
ms.
nancy
hollander
not
by
this
treaty.
but
that...
marijuana,
coca
leaves
and
poppies
are
specifically
covered
by
the
1961
treaty.
ms.
nancy
hollander
well,
the
difference,
for
example,
with
marijuana,
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
1961
treaty,
it
says
"the
plant,
all
parts
of
the
plant,
everything
from
the
plant.
"
it's
all
covered.
what
the
1971
treaty
did
was
different.
and
if
you
read
the
1971
treaty
and
the
1988
treaty
and
their
commentaries,
if
i
can
rely
on
their
commentaries,
and
the
international
narcotics
control
board,
what
they
are
expressing
is
a
concern
for
the
traditional
religious
and
mystical
use
of
plants
in
religion,
and
that's
what
they
were
concerned
about,
and
that's
why
they
didn't
put
this
in,
and
that's
why
they
specifically
have,
in
the
commentary,
that
the
example
of
mimosa...
and
they
also
have
an
example
of
peyote
in
the
same
paragraph
12,
where
they--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--not
to
my--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not
contradicting
the
treaty,
because
the
government
is
taking
this
one
sentence
preparation,
and
the
government
has
a
definition
of
it,
for
this
litigation
only,
that
is
contrary
to
the
definition
in
the
treaty
the
way
it
is
interpreted
by
the
travaux
and
by
the
commentary,
and
by
this
executive,
which
means
that
the
executive's
position
here
is
really
entitled
to
no
deference;
because,
otherwise,
the
tea
drunk
by
the
native
american
church,
the
peyote
tea,
would
also
be
covered.
ms.
nancy
hollander
that's--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that's
correct.
and
we
don't
import
dmt.
we
import
a
tea
that
contains
an
enormous
number
of
alkaloids.
and
it
was
clear
in--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--it
was...
it's
clear--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
however,
the
treaty
wanted
to
be...
the
treaty
writers
were
very
careful
to
not
impinge
on
traditional
religious
use.
and
rfra...
and
there's
one
more
thing
that
i've
been
trying
to
say,
and
that
is
that
rfra
requires
not
just
a
compelling
interest,
but
a
compelling
interest
to
the
person,
and
it
requires
least
restrictive
means.
ms.
nancy
hollander
least--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--to
the
aggrieved
person.
to
this
particular--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that's
right.
that's
correct.
but--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--but
rfra
also
requires
that
the
government
prove,
if
it
proves
a
compelling
interest,
to
enforce
it
against
the
person,
and
if
it
gets
there,
it
also
must
prove
that
it
is
furthering
that
compelling
interest
by
the
least
restrictive
means.
now--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--well,
i
disagree,
your
honor.
for
example,
other
countries
that
have
domestic
policies
have
found
ways
to
accommodate
that
have
not
violated
the
treaty.
for
example,
switzerland
provides
needles
and
heroin
to
its...
to
its
drug
users.
and
the
united
states
has
not
objected
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
treaty.
ms.
nancy
hollander
and--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--well--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--until
they
reproduce.
[laughter]
your
honor,
the
analysis
would
be
the
same.
first,
that
religion
would
have
to
prove
it
was
a
sincere
religion
and
meet
that
burden.
and
then
the
government
could
come
forward
with
a
compelling
interest
that...
and
the...
and
perhaps
find
the
same
thing
that
was
found
in
reynolds,
which
was
not
a
strict
scrutiny
case,
but
may
come
out
the
same
way...
the
sanctity
of
marriage,
the
other
issues.
and
those
would
be
issues
of
fact
for
a
district
judge
to
decide,
under
his
discretion.
and
it...
all
rfra
does
is
give
every
religious
organization,
the
minority
ones
and
the
majority
ones,
the
opportunity
to
go
into
court
as
an
aggrieved
person
and
make
their
claim
and
see
whether
the
government
can
meet
its
burden.
ms.
nancy
hollander
well--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--"diversion",
your
honor,
is
a
term
of
art
here.
and
i
thought
i
answered
it
that
way,
but
maybe
i
was
unclear.
it
means
diversion
from
licit
use
to
illicit
use.
so,
it's--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--no,
it
would
not
be
diversion.
there
would
only
be
a
problem
if
the
government,
for
example,
showed--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--that
there
was
some
diversion
outside.
and
that's
why
i
used
the
example
of
the
native
american
church;
there's
never
been
any
diversion.
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
one
other
issue
that
perhaps
i
didn't
make
clear.
what
the...
it's
true
that
the
udv
does
not
import
the
plants.
but
it's
those
plants
that
are
sacred
to
the
udv.
it
can't
substitute
them.
not
only
is
dmt
in
bananas
and
pineapple,
but
phalaris
grass,
for
example,
that...
and
there's
a
picture
of
one
in
our
joint
appendix
at
page

i
believe...
grows
in
this
country.
a
recreational
user
could
just
go
and,
you
know,
mix
the
phalaris--

--grass.
ms.
nancy
hollander
well,
the...
what
the
commentary
says
is
that
it
is
not
a
covered
preparation,
that
an
infusion
or
tea
made
from
the
roots
of
a
plant
is
not
a
covered
preparation,
and
that--
ms.
nancy
hollander
--well,
we
certainly
have
a
great
deal
of
more
evidence,
your
honor,
that
we
can
put
in.
we
have
substantial
evidence
on
the
treaty,
and
evidence
we
haven't
even
talked
about
here,
proving
that
this
hoasca
is
not
covered
by
the
treaty.
we
have
additional
health
and
safety
evidence.
we
have
additional
evidence
to
show
lack
of
diversion.
we
have
additional
evidence
that
judge
parker
talks
about
to
show
targeting
of
the
religion
and
selective
prosecution.
we
have
a
great
deal
more
evidence
we
can
put
on.
but,
of
course,
it
depends
on
what
the
government
puts
on.
because,
at
this
point,
the
government
has
not
met
any
of
its
burdens.
now,
you're
correct
about
the
treaty.
none
of
that
has
gone
on.
the
government
resisted
any
evidence
about
the
treaty,
resisted
the
very
best
evidence,
which
was
the
international
narcotics
control
board's
opinion
that
hoasca
is
not
covered
by
the
treaty.
and
we
now
have...
we
now
have
more
that
we
would
put
on.
and,
you
know,
what
the
church
and
its
members
seek
is
just
the
right
to
practice
their
religious
faith,
as
congress
guaranteed
them
in
rfra.
because
congress
guaranteed
and
recognized
that
religious
liberty
is
a
core
value
in
this
country.
two
courts
below
found,
on
a
lengthy
factual
record,
that
the
government
had
not
met
the
burdens
congress
imposed.
this
court
should
do...
even
if
this
court
believes
that
it's
a
close
question...
should
do
then
what
it
did
in
ashcroft
v.
aclu,
affirm
the
preliminary
injunction,
remand
this
case
for
a
trial
on
the
merits.
if
this
court
were
to
do
anything
less
than
that,
it's
really
to
deny
congress's
intent
and
congress's
policy
here,
because
congress's
policy
is
that
religious
freedom,
religious
liberty,
shall
not
be
burdened
unless,
and
until,
the
government
meets
its
burdens.
the
district
court
clearly
found,
and
said,
that
the
government
did
not
show
a
risk
of
harm,
did
not
show
a
risk
of
diversion;
and,
therefore,
he
found
that
the
government
did
not
meet
its
compelling
interests
in
this
case.
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
preliminary
injunction,
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court.
thank
you.
