mr.

justice

--mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kneedler,
i
think
everyone
would
concede
that
there
is
a
compelling
interest,
governmental
interest,
to
have
the
controlled
substances
act
on
that
level,
yes.
but
then,
congress
has
passed
another
statute
that
says
all
laws
shall
be
subject
to
rfra...
shall
be
subject
to
rfra.
so,
we
can't
just
look
at
"is
there
a
compelling
state
interest
for
the
controlled
substances
act?
"
in
a
vacuum.
we
have
to
take
what
was
a
later
statute,
rfra,
to
which
the
controlled
substances
act
is
made
subject
by
congress.
and
i
thought
the
argument
was,
is
there
a
compelling
state
interest
in
that
context?
how
can
there
be,
given
the
situation
with
peyote
and,
"we're
just
like
the
native
american
church
in
that
regard?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
understand
that
if
the
government
had
acted
uniformly.
but
we
do
have
two
situations
that
seem
to
be
like...
the
peyote
and
this
case.
and
if
the
government
must
accommodate
to
one,
why
not
to
the
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
kneedler,
may
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
stop
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there?
because,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
it
was
my
impression
that
the
dea
was
allowing
an
exemption
for
peyote
use
by
the
native
american
church
before
congress
passed
the
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
take
it
that
the
government
was
right...
before
congress
passed
the
law,
the
government
was
right
to
give
the
exemption
to
allow
that
ceremonial
use
of
peyote,
then
i
don't
see
how
you
get
mileage
from
a
congressional
act
that
was
passed
later
than
congress's
is
saying,
"executive,
we
agree
with
you,
you
did
right.
"
but
it's
not...
you...
i
don't
see
how
you
can
rely
on
the
congressional
statute
when
the
government
was
doing
this
even
without
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--congressional
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
congress,
consistent
with
the
establishment
clause,
say
that
we
will
create
an
exception
for
peyote,
but
not
for
this
other
church,
which
has
far
fewer
members,
less
risk
of
diversion,
has
been
found
to
be
a
genuine
religion?
the
problem
of
preferring
one
religious
group
over
another,
it
seems
to
me,
arises
once
there
is
an
exception
for
the
native
american
church.
and
i
heard
you
say,
"well,
the
indian
tribes
are
special.
"
but
is
that...
that's
it.
it
would
have
to
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i...
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case?
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
preliminary
injunction.
that's
how
it
got
here.
and
we
have
been
discussing,
mostly,
the
case
just
as
though
it
had
been
a
permanent
injunction.
the...
there
are
pieces
of
this
case,
like
the
treaty
and
what
it
allows
and
doesn't
allow,
that...
where
the
record
is
so
thin.
is
there
a
way
of
dealing
with
this
case
so
there
is
the
full
airing
that
it
never
got,
without
resolving,
at
this
point,
other
issues--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you've
been
debating?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
interest
is
defined,
as
mr.
kneedler
did...
that
is,
these
drugs
are
"no,
absolutely
prohibited".
--then
how
can
you
have
any
less
restrictive
means?
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can...
i
understand
your
argument
about
a
compelling
state
interest
has
to
be
judged
in
context...
to
the
person,
to
this
church.
but
if
mr.
kneedler
is
correct
that
the
compelling
state
interest
is
that
this
is
a
proscribed
drug,
then
there
can't
be
any
least
restrictive
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
hollander,
may
i
just,
on
this
point...
it's
the
same
question
i
raised
with
mr.
kneedler.
we're
talking
about
a
preliminary
injunction.
your
side,
i
think,
said,
"go
for
the
permanent
injunction.
"
"we
have
a
lot
more
to
put
in.
"
the
presentation
on
the
treaty
was
rather
thin,
below.
i
take
it
from
mr.
kneedler's
argument
that
he's
saying
the
preliminary
injunction,
or
not,
is
really
the
thing.
if
the
government
wins,
no
preliminary
injunction.
there's
not
going
to
be
any
show
for
a
permanent
injunction.
but,
on
your
side
of
it,
what
more
would
you
be
putting
in?
let's
say
you
prevail
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage.
would
you
then
say,
"see,
judge,
now
you
can
enter
a
permanent
injunction?
"
or
you...
would
you
be
putting
in
more
evidence?
and
if
so,
what
kind?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--kneedler,
if
you
prevail,
would
there
be
anything
left
over
to
be
argued
about
in
the...
for
permanent
injunction?
