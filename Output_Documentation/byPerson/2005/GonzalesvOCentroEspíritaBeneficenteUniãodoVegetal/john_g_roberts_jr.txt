we'll
hear
argument
next
in
gonzales
versus
o
centro

mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
when
you
talk
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--reasons
to
believe
and
disbelieve,
we
don't
have
to
make
a
once
and
for
all
determination,
do
we?
a
lot
of
your
concerns
talk
about
what's
going
to
happen
if
this
exception
is
granted.
now,
if
some
of
those
things
come
true,
can't
this
issue
be
revisited?
i
don't
regard...
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but,
under
rfra,
you're
not
saying
it's
a
compelling
interest
test.
it
may
be...
may
not
be
satisfied
in
this
case,
but
if
it
turns
out
there's
a
lot
of
diversion
of
the
hallucinogen
or
the
membership
of
the
church
expands
in
a
way
that
leads
you
to
believe
it's
being
abused,
i
mean,
then
you'd
look
at
it
again,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your...
but
your
approach
is
totally
categorical.
if
you
had
a
group
that
had,
once
a
year,
one
drop
of
the
hallucinogen
involved
here,
per
member,
and
it
was
rigorously
policed,
your
position
would
still
be
the
same--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
applying
rfra,
which
sets
forth
a
compelling
interest
test.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
was
a
little
unclear
about
your
position
on
the
convention.
i
thought,
at
some...
one
point,
you
said
that
it
didn't
really
add
much
to
your
argument
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
which
implemented
the
convention.
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
an
independent--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--argument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
ms.
hollander.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
your
theory
would
be
if
you
had
a
religious
group
that...
whose
doctrine
was
that
you
should
proselytize
through
hoasca,
and
they
want
everybody
to
come,
and
they're
aggressive
in
doing
that,
and
distributing
hoasca,
that
the
government
should
be
in
a
position
of
saying,
"this
religious
group
can
use
it,
but
that
religious
group
can't?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
they're
the
kind
of
the...
the
ones
i
just
gave
you.
in
other
words,
if
there's
going
to
be
a
greater
threat
of
diversion
to...
it's
not
limited
to
the
members
of
a
very
cohesive
and
limited
group,
but
it's...
they're...
they
aggressively
try
to
reach
out,
but
it's
all
part
of
a
sincere
religious
belief,
that
we
should,
in
applying
rfra,
draw
distinctions
between
the
group
you
represent
and
that
hypothetical
group?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
assuming
they
show--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
there
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thought
that's
because
we
made
a
special
reservation
for
peyote.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
the
right
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
has
to
be
extracted
at
some
point
to
be...
to
get
into...
i'm
right
here...
to
get
into
the
tea,
right?
it's
extracted
by
the
preparation
of
the
tea.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
plants
are
not...
the
plants
are
not
imported,
right?
just
the
tea.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
i...
if
i
could
just
go
back
to
the
point.
you're
emphasizing
that
the
treaty
doesn't
cover
the
importation
of
plants.
but
you're
not
importing
plants,
you're--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--importing
a
mixture
that
must
contain
the
covered
hallucinogen
or
it
doesn't
have
its
effect.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
under
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--theory,
a
marijuana
tea
would
not
be
covered
by
the
treaty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
they're
not
being
imported,
they're
transformed
into
this
tea.
and
you...
saying
the
active
substance
isn't
there
independently,
so
it's
not
covered.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a...
an
erroneous
reading
of
the
treaty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
except
that
you
don't
import
the
plants,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
the
person.
to
what
person?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
hollander.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
4
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what...
but
what
does
that
benefit
you?
i
mean...
i
guess
this
is
justice
scalia's
question
he
asked
earlier...
the
treaty
is...
it
seems
to
me
if
you're
willing
to
override
a
duly
enacted
statute,
the
treaty
shouldn't
have
any
greater
status.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
the
treaty
gives
you
a
more
compelling
governmental
interest
than
the
controlled
substances
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
we
have
to
agree
with
you,
though,
that
our
treaty
partners
in
this
area
have,
sort
of,
a
zero
tolerance
approach
to
enforcing
the
treaty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
in
04-1084,
gonzales
versus
o
centro
espirita
beneficente
uniao
do
vegetal,
or
the
udv.
the
udv
is
a
christian
spiritist
religious
sect
with
roots
in
the
amazon
rainforest.
its
members
receive
communion
at
religious
services
by
drinking
hoasca,
a
tea
brewed
from
two
plants
found
only
in
the
rainforest.
hoasca
contains
dmt,
a
hallucinogen
regulated
as
a
schedule
i
substance
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
the
udv
has
thousands
of
members
in
brazil,
but
only
about
130
in
the
united
states.
in
1999,
the
federal
government
intercepted
a
shipment
of
hoasca
intended
for
the
udv
in
the
united
states,
asserting
that
the
controlled
substances
act
bars
all
use
of
the
hallucinogen
dmt.
the
church
sued
to
establish
its
right
to
continue
using
the
tea
in
its
religious
services.
the
udv
relied
on
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act,
which
was
passed
in
1993.
under
that
statute,
the
government
may
not
substantially
burdening
a
sincere
exercise
of
religion
unless
it
shows
that
the
burden
serves
a
compelling
interest.
before
the
main
trial,
the
district
court
heard
evidence
from
both
parties
and
concluded
that
the
government
was
not
likely
to
show
a
compelling
interest
in
this
case
and
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
barring
the
government
from
interfering
with
the
church
until
the
main
trial
is
over.
the
10th
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
decision,
and
we
agreed
to
hear
the
government’s
challenge
to
the
preliminary
injunction.
as
the
case
came
to
us,
there
are
number
of
salient
points.
first,
the
government
concedes
that
the
udv’s
use
of
hoasca
is
a
sincere
exercise
of
religion.
second,
the
government
concedes
that
enforcing
the
controlled
substances
act
against
the
udv
would
substantially
burden
that
sincere
exercise
of
religion.
and
third,
the
trial
court
looked
at
the
evidence
and
found
that
the
government
had
not
carried
its
burden
of
showing
a
compelling
interest
in
preventing
harm
to
church
members
from
drinking
hoasca
or
in
preventing
diversion
of
dmt
from
church
members
to
others.
the
government
has
not
asked
us
to
revisit
these
factual
findings;
instead,
the
government’s
main
argument
before
us
is
a
categorical
one,
that
it
has
a
compelling
interest
in
the
uniform
application
of
the
controlled
substances
act
so
that
no
exception
for
the
church
can
be
made.
we
reject
that
argument.
congress,
in
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act,
required
courts
to
consider
exceptions
to
generally
applicable
laws
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
to
do
so
by
examining
the
specific
practices
involved.
the
question
under
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
is
not
whether
dmt
is
harmful
in
general,
but
whether
the
government
has
shown
a
compelling
interest
in
stopping
the
udv’s
particular
use
of
hoasca.
the
government’s
broad
argument
that
it
has
a
compelling
interest
in
not
allowing
exceptions
to
the
controlled
substances
act
is
undermined
by
the
fact
that
there
already
is
an
exception
in
the
statute
for
the
religious
use
of
peyote,
another
schedule
i
hallucinogenic
substance,
by
the
native
american
church.
if
an
exception
for
use
of
a
controlled
substance
is
permitted
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
native
americans,
we
do
not
see
why
there
can
be
no
consideration
of
a
similar
exception
for
the
130
or
so
members
of
the
church
at
issue
here.
the
government
did
not
carry
its
burden
of
showing
a
compelling
interest
on
the
facts
before
the
district
court;
they
cannot
make
up
for
the
failure
here
by
arguing
that
there
can
be
no
exceptions
to
the
controlled
substances
act.
for
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
that
preliminary
injunction
allowing
the
udv
to
continue
to
use
hoasca
in
its
religious
services
pending
full
trial
on
the
merits
and
remain
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
all
members
of
the
court
join
the
opinion
except
for
justice
alito,
who
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
