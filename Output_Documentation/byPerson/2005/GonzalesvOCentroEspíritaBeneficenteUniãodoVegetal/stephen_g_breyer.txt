justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
grant
you
that
administrative
considerations
are
relevant.
of
course
they're
relevant.
but
that's
far
from
saying
they're
determinative.
and
then
we're
back
to
what
justice
souter
said,
absolutely
relevant
in
deciding
the
compelling
interest,
but
the
fact
that
peyote
seems
to
have
been
administered
without
the
sky
falling
in
suggests
that,
here,
they're
not
determinative.
that's
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--part
of
the
treaty
question
that
i
had
is
also...
this
is
a
root
that
you
are...
and
it
contains
dmt.
and
the
treaty
doesn't
ban
everything
that
contains
dmt...
for
example,
pineapple
and
bananas.
the
question
is
the
ratio
of
the
dmt
to
the
entire
plant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
sounds
like
a
factual
question
that
ought
to
be
developed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
pineapples,
we...
what
about
those?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
drank
pineapple--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--juice
this
morning.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
isn't
the
compelling
interest.
the
compelling
interest
is,
we
signed
a
treaty,
and
you
follow
it.
now,
how
can
you
say
that
the
government
wouldn't
have
a
compelling
interest
in
following
a
treaty
where
they...
where
they
promised
to
ban
the
substance?
i
mean,
they're
not...
they're
just
saying
rfra
doesn't
apply
where
that's
at
stake.
now,
what's
the
argument
against
that?
you're
saying
the
argument
against
that
is,
maybe
it
really
isn't
a
compelling
interest?
well,
okay.
why
not?
i
mean,
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
it
would
be.
they
have
a
treaty.
they
have
to
live
up
to
their
word,
period.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does?
all
right.
that's
an
issue,
i
guess.
i'd
have
to
decide,
is
a
compelling
and...
does
it
require
the
government
to
go
further?
but
you
concede
that
if
it
doesn't
require
the
government
to
go
further,
you
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
that's
a
different
issue.
why
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
specific
language
from
the
treaty's
commentary
in
front
of
me
that
supports
you.
are
you
not
going
to
read
that?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
if
there
isn't
a
factual
question
here.
i
mean,
i
thought
justice
scalia,
if
it
were
to
be
up
to
him,
did
take
into
account
official
commentaries
to
treaties.
but
maybe
he
doesn't.
anyway,
i
take
them
into
account.
and
i...
and
in
respect
to
that,
i
read
this
as
saying,
specifically,
that
the
plants...
it
doesn't
include
the
substance
if
it
is
a
substance
clearly
distinguished
from
the
substance
constituting
its
active
principal...
and
the
example
they
give
is
mimosa
root,
which
contains
dmt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then,
that's
also
true
of
the
bananas
and
pineapples,
et
cetera.
and
there's
a
court
holding
that
hoasca's
out
of
it,
in
france
and
one
in
the
netherlands,
all
of
which
i
think
was
relevant
to
a
treaty.
all
right?
now,
the
government
has
come
in
with
a
counterargument
and
said
it
clearly
does
cover,
i
guess,
even
mimosa
roots,
where
they
are
imported
solely
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
dmt.
now,
what's
the
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
as...
i
understand
the
treaty.
what
the
treaty
says
is,
you
can't
import
substances
listed
in
schedule
1.
then
you
look
at
schedule
1,
and
it
doesn't
say
hoasca.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
dmt>
["].
and
then
it
has
another...
and,
interpreting
that,
it
says
the
fact,
if
you
look
at
that
list
and
it
says
dmt>
["],
means
what
it
says,
you
can't
import
dmt.
it's
a
drug
importation
statute,
and
it
doesn't
cover
plants
that
contain
the
substance
dmt.
otherwise,
we'd
have...
throw
out
bananas
and...
or
mimosa,
anyway.
and
we're
not
looking
to
intent
on
that.
now,
that's
a
possible
interpretation
that
doesn't
contradict
anything.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
in
trouble.
that's
harder,
then,
if
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
see...
i
mean,
i
see
i
was
not
right.
you
do
import
drums
of
tea.
and
they
say,
in
the
treaty,
that
a
preparation
is
a
solution
or
mixture
containing
a
substance.
and
it
would
seem
to
be
a
solution
or
a
mixture
containing
dmt.
and
the
commentary
that
i
thought
helped
you
does
concern
plants,
but
you're
not
importing
plants.
so,
now
i'm
rather
troubled
to
see
if
there
is
any
way
that
this
treaty
is
interpreted
in
a
manner
that
allows
you
to
win.
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
actually
why
i've
been
looking.
i'm
bothered
by
it,
because
it...
if
the
treaty
is
absolute,
we
reserve
for
peyote,
which
would
mean
the
religious
use
of
peyote
by
the
native
american
tribes
is
exempt,
but
other
people
who
have
identical
religions,
use
identical
substances,
they're
stuck.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
rather
rough
problem
under
the
first
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
religion
singled
out.
and,
therefore,
i'm
looking
for
some
way
in
this
treaty
not
to
reach
that
conclusion--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
the
constitutional
reason.
