justice

scalia
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
it
still
shows...
whatever
power
they
were...
they
were
proceeding
under,
it
still
shows
that
it's
not
all
that
important
that
nobody
be
able
to
use
a
substance
banned
by
category
1.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever
power
it
was
under,
it's
a
demonstration
that
you
can
make
an
exception
without
the
sky
falling.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
why
we
came
out
the
other
way
in
smith,
by
the
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--rfra
overrides
all
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
rfra
to
be...
to
say
there
can
be
an
exception
to
all
federal
statutes
where
someone
makes
a
religious
objection
to
compliance
and,
in
the
judgment
of
the
court,
there's
not
a
compelling
state
interest
in
the
government
going
ahead
with
the
statute.
so,
you
know,
whatever
the
scheme
was
under
the
drug
laws,
it
seems
to
me
it's
subject
to
this
new
legislation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--couldn't
have
said
it
better.
and
that's
what
we
said
in
smith.
but
congress
didn't
like
smith
and
has
enacted
this
statute
obviously
to
undo,
to
the
extent
it
can,
the
effect
of
our
judgment
in
smith.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
whether
you
can
be
a
member
of
that
church
without
being
an
indian?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
whose
position
it
is.
the
language
does
not
admit
of
that
exception.
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
it
that
would
suggest
that
exception
at
all.
what
language
do
you
rely
upon
for
that
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
whole,
anywhere
in
it...
give
me
language
anywhere
in
the
whole
treaty
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suggests
that
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
our
treaty
partners
are
just
violating
the
treaty.
justice
antonin
scalia
she's
not
going
to
read
it,
because
i
asked
her
for
language
in
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--treaty.
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
treaty--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
treaty.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
make
a
suggestion
as
to
why,
even
if
it
is
covered
by
the
treaty,
it
may
not
be
a
compelling
state
interest
to
comply
with
the
treaty?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
haven't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
made.
i...
i
mean,
isn't
it
well
established
that
statutes
trump
treaties,
that
if
congress
decides,
in
a
subsequent
statute,
to
ignore
a
treaty,
it
may
do
so?
now,
if
this
rfra
can
trump
a
statute,
it
would
seem
to
me,
a
fortiori,
it
can
trump
a
treaty.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
compliance--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
a
treaty
is
not
necessarily
a
compelling
state
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
about
commentary
or
travaux,
i
don't
mind
using
them
for
treaties,
so
long
as
they
don't
contradict
the
treaty.
do
we
have
any
case
where
we
use
the...
les
travaux
preparatoires
to
actually
contradict
the
language
of
the
treaty?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what,
it
seems
to
me,
is
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
that.
you
said
that
before,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
worry
about
the
general
proposition
we
would
be
adopting
if
we
say,
you
know,
one
narrow
exception
is
not
a...
doesn't
contravene
a
compelling
state
interest.
what
about...
i
assume
there
is
still
a
federal
law
against
bigamy
that
applies
in
federal
territories.
now,
what
if,
you
know,
a
small
religious
group
comes
forward
and
said,
you
know,
"we...
our
religion
requires
bigamy.
"
"there
are
not
a
whole
lot
of
us.
"
"we're
just
a
little
tiny
group.
"
"so,
we
demand,
under
rfra,
an
exemption
from
this
absolute
law.
"
"why
does
it
have
to
be
absolute?
"
"it's
just
a
little
tiny
exception,
only
a
few
of
us.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
at
least
for
now.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
more
than
doubly.
it
has
to
be
doubly,
plus
a
little,
if
you
said
that
one
is
even
more
than
the
other.
[laughter]
but
that's
okay.
