justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
address
a
preliminary
inquiry
that
i
have?
are
we
reviewing
here
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
by
the
trial
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
have
to
find
that,
for
the
trial
court
to
have
issued
it,
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
court
found
evidence
in
equipoise
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
so
i
just
wondered,
at
the
bottom
line,
what
our
legal
standard
is
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
abused
its
discretion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
didn't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--say
that,
did
it?
i
mean,
it
did
seem
to
indicate,
after
the
passage
of
rfra,
courts
are
supposed
to
examine,
in
each
case,
whether
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
and
whether
it's
closely
enough
related.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
congress
disagreed,
ultimately.
they
allowed
the
use
of
peyote.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
makes--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--think
that
the
treaty...
the
convention
entered
into
in
1971...
makes
clear
that
hoasca
is
covered,
then
does
that
provide
a
compelling
interest
for
the
government,
because
it
requires
the
government
to
prohibit
the
importation?
if
we
think,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
convention
covers
hoasca.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
conclude,
looking
at
the
treaty,
that
it
prohibits
hoasca,
covers
it,
and
that
it
provides
that
nations
that
enter
into
the
convention
must
avoid
importation
of
it,
then
is
that
a
compelling
interest
under
rfra?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
