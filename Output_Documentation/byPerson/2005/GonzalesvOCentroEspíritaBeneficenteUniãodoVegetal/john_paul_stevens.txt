justice
john
paul
stevens
but
justice
scalia's
point
is,
no
matter
what
the
legal
theory,
the
evidence,
historical
evidence,
seems
to
indicate
that
the
sky
didn't
fall.
and
if
it
didn't
fall
for
the
larger
number
of
native
americans
involved
who
use
peyote,
and
the
very
small
number
using
this
drug,
can't
we,
kind
of,
think
that
at
least,
"well,
maybe
it's
not
all
that
compelling?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
of
course,
the
reason
you
import
it
is
because
it
contains
this
particular
substance.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
explain
that
again?
you
said
a
compelling
interest
to
the...
what
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question...
tangential
just
a
little,
but
going
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question
earlier
about
diversion?
and
his
suggestion
was,
if
they're...
proselyte
the
religion,
you
get
all
sorts
of
converts
who
will
just
use
it
in
the
same
way
as
the
small
number
use
it
now.
would
that
be
diversion,
or
would
it
be
diversion...
diverting
it
to
some
people
who
are
not
members
of
the
religion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
does
the
word
"diversion"
mean
in
this
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
then,
getting
more
members
to...
converted
to
the
religion
would
not
be
diversion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
