mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
carves
out
an
exception
to
the
categorical
prohibition
for
the
controlled
substances
act
in
order
to
permit
respondents
to
import,
distribute,
and
use
a
schedule
1
controlled
substance.
the
court
of
appeals
believed
this
exception
was
justified
by
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
in
order
to
enable
respondents
to
use
hoasca
tea,
which
contains
dimethyltryptamine,
or
dmt,
in
the
substance,
for
religious
purposes.
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong.
rfra
carries
forward
the
compelling
interest
test,
as
set
forth
in
prior
federal
court
decisions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
with
respect
to
certain
aspects
of
the
preliminary
injunction
question,
yes.
for
example,
whether
a
preliminary
injunction
should...
is
the
proper
remedy
if
all
the
other
criteria
are
satisfied.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred...
or
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
erred,
as
a
matter
of
law,
in
entering
the
injunction--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
abused...
a
court
always
abuses
its
discretion
if
it...
if
it
commits
a
legal
error.
so,
that
is
basically
our
position
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--first
of
all,
our
principal
submission
is
that
congress's
designation
in
schedule
1
is
sufficient
unto
itself.
but
we
also
do
include
a
further
submission
that,
if
the
court
didn't
disagree
with
that,
that
congress's...
congress,
in
schedule
1,
has
said
that
any
mixture
containing
any
amount
of
a
listed
hallucinogenic
substance
is
barred.
and
there's
no
question
that
this
substance
contains
that.
but
if
the
court
was
going
to
look
beyond
that
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
there's
also
no
question
in
this
case
that
respondents'
use
of
the
substance
produces
the
very
effects
that
led
congress
to
put
the
substance
on
schedule
1.
so,
to
allow
the...
to
allow
the
substance
to
be
used
would
be
in
direct
derogation
of
congress's
judgment.
the
disagreement,
such
as
there
is,
goes
not
to
the...
not
to
that
question.
and
that's
on
page
214(a)
of
the
joint
appendix...
or
the
petition
appendix.
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
those
effects
are
produced.
respondents'
argument
in
the
lower
courts
was
essentially
that
those
effects
shouldn't
matter,
or
that
those
effects
should
be
ignored.
but
we
think
that
that's
inconsistent
with
congress's
judgment.
so,
my
point
is,
if
you
go
beyond
the
text
of
the
statute,
it
shouldn't
be
for
anything
more
than
to...
for
the
court
to
assure
itself
that
the
effects
that
caused
congress
to
list
the
subject,
in
fact,
occur,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
but
under...
the
act
does
say
carry
forward
the
prior
federal
court
decisions.
but,
prior
to
smith,
this
court,
on
a
number
of
occasions,
had
recognized
the
compelling
interest
in
uniform
enforcement
of
important
statutes
that
could
not
function
under
a
system
of
individualized
religious--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--exemptions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
argument
is
not
that
the
controlled
substances
act
is
not
subject
to
rfra.
it
is
subject
to
rfra.
but...
just
as
it
was
subject
to
the
first
amendment's
free
exercise
clause...
and,
in
this
court's
presmith
cases,
in
which
the
court...
at
least
congress
understood
the
court
to
have
been
applying
a
compelling
interest
test,
the
court
was
applying
that
compelling
interest
test
to
particular
statutes
under
which
individualized
religious
exemptions
would
not
be
feasible,
and
held,
as
a
categorical
matter,
that
they
were
not
required.
the
social
security
act,
the
tax
code,
the
laws
against
polygamy,
the
sunday
closing
laws,
all
are...
all
of
those
are
ones
in
which
the
court
had
previously
concluded
that
individualized
exceptions
were
not
appropriate.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
the
peyote
exception,
congress
was
acting
under
its
distinct
constitutionally
recognized
authority
with
respect
to
indian
tribes.
the
indian
commerce
clause
specifically
authorizes
congress
to
legislate
with
respect
to
indian
tribes--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i,
in
no
way,
think
that
congress
believed
that
by
enacting
the
special
provision
for
indian
tribes,
it
was
thereby
opening
the
controlled
substances
act
to
individualized--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--religious
exceptions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
what's
wrong
with
the
argument
is
that
what
congress
did
with
respect
to
indian
tribes
was
take
a
look
at
that
distinct
context
and
conclude
that,
for
a
variety
of
reasons...
and,
particularly,
respecting
the
autonomous
authority
of
an
independent
indian
tribe
to
control
its
internal
affairs
this
exception
applies
only
to
members
of
recognized
indian
tribes...
that,
in
that
context,
balancing
all
of
the
relevant
considerations...
not
the
sort
of
balance
under
rfra--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
balancing
all
the
considerations
under
the...
its
indian
power,
concluded
there
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that
was...
that
was
a
specific
judgment
made
by
congress
itself,
looking
at--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--all
the
factors.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that...
that's
correct,
but
that
was
understood
at
the...
at...
back
in
1970,
or
back,
actually,
in
'65,
when
that
was
first
adopted,
to
have
been
consistent
with
congress's
original
intent
in
passing
the
statute,
and
the
controlled
substances
act,
which
carried
forward
the
schedules.
but,
in
any
event,
congress
has
now
addressed
the
subject
by
statute,
following
the
enactment
of
rfra,
following
this
court's
decision
in
smith,
and
which
has
brought
things
into
quite
different
focus.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
statute
actually,
you
know,
now
gives
some
firm
statutory
basis
for
that
exception,
which
may
not
really
have
existed
so
comfortably
after
this
court's
decision
in
smith.
and
there
was,
it's
true,
nothing
specific
in
the
statute
before.
the
critical
point,
though,
to
bear
in
mind
for
the
sort
of
claim
that
respondents
are
arguing
for
here
is
that
it
would
turn
over
to
700
district
judges
a
determination
based
on
particular
records,
particular
credibility
determinations,
the
judgment
as
to
whether--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--an
exception--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
all
respect--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but--
[laughter]
--but
even
when
congress
went
back
to
presmith,
again
congress
recognized
that
there
are
certain
statutes
in...
that
serve
a
compelling
interest
that
would
be
undermined
by
individualized
determinations,
and
the
controlled--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--substances
act--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
it...
but
that
was
the
test
that
the
court
was
applying,
as
congress
understood
it,
prior
to
smith,
in
which,
i
repeat,
the
court
said
there
were
certain
statutes
that
categorical
judgments
could
be
made
about.
and
the
controlled
substances
act
is
such
a
statute,
as
this
court
recognized
in
raich
and
in
oakland
cannabis--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--where
the
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--our
argument
would
be
the
same,
but
for
an
additional
reason
there,
and
that
is
that
even
where
congress
has...
or
even
where
a
substance
may
be
distributed
and
used,
it
is
only
for
medical
purposes,
which
is
in
furtherance
of,
not
in
derogation
of,
the
health
and
safety
purposes
of
the
statute.
and
even
then,
it
is
done
to
very
strict...
pursuant
to
very
strict
controls
that
are
really
incompatible
with
sacramental
use
of
a
substance.
there
is
a
requirement
of
prescription,
or
dispensing
by
a
physician
under
physician
control,
with
recordkeeping...
identifying
the
dosage,
the
amount
of
the
sacrament...
recordkeeping
of
the
person
who
takes
it.
there
is...
there
is
an
incompatibility
and
potential
entanglement
problem
in
how
to...
in
trying
to
apply
a
system
like
that,
even
under
schedule
2.
but
under
schedule
1,
what
you
have
is
contraband,
as
this
court
said--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
raich.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
way
the
controlled
substances
act
operates,
it
does
not
permit
a
rescheduling
or
use
of
a
drug
based
on
individualized
determinations
made
by
individual
federal
district
courts
making
their
own
judgment
about
how
serious
the
risk
is.
if
a
substance
is
going
to
be
moved
from
schedule
1
to
schedule
2,
for
example,
to
allow
medical
use,
that
is
done
through
a
centralized
administrative
determination
involving
coordination
between
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
and
the
attorney
general,
in
which
expert
opinions
are
gotten
and
a
judgment
is
made,
but
the
judgment
is
made
only
if
there
is
an
accepted
medical
use.
in
other
words,
there
has
to
be
not...
a
consensus,
not
simply
an...
a
determination
by
one
religious
group
or
one
judge--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
something
may
be
so.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we're
not
saying
it's
not
subject
to
the
legislation,
but
in
deciding
how
the
compelling
interest
applies
under
the
statute...
just
as
under
the
first
amendment
itself,
before
rfra
was
passed,
and
the
one
is
to
replicate
the
other...
the
court...
there
were
certain
statutes,
when
the
court
looked
at
the
way
they
operated
and
what
was
necessary
to
their
effectuation,
the
court
said
that
individualized
exceptions
would
not
be
feasible.
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe,
and
every
reason
to
disbelieve--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
congress
meant
to
put
that
to
one
side.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
have
several
responses
to
that.
that
sort
of
approach,
putting
to
the
test
basically
a
congregation
by
congregation...
or
denomination
by
denomination,
to
use
familiar
terms...
test
about
whether
a...
an
exception
should
be
recognized
for
a
particular
religion,
itself,
presents
difficult
questions.
if
you...
if
you
have
a
particular
religious
sect
that
believes
that
it
is...
that
it
is
important
to
invite
everyone
to
the
table...
not
simply
a
closed
group
that
has
gone
through
screening,
but
a...
but
everyone
to
their
table--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
would
be...
but
that
would...
that...
the...
a
court
would
be
in
a
judgment
about...
in
saying
that
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
what...
it
did
not
seek,
under
the
judgment
in
smith.
what
the
court
was...
what
congress
was
responding
to
was
the...
what
it
understood
to
be
the
the
test.
it
reinstated
the
compelling
interest
test,
but
specifically
said
it
was
not
disagreeing
with
the
outcome
of
any
particular
case
under
that
prior
test.
and
three
of
those
cases...
hernandez,
concerning
the
tax
code;
lee,
concerning
the
social
security
act;
and
braunfeld,
regarding
the
sunday
closing
laws...
were
all
ones
that
adopted
the
approach
that
i
have
suggested.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
our--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--our
principal
position
would
be
the
same.
and
i...
and
i
think
that
that
approach
is
consistent
with
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
smith,
which
got
a
lot
of
prominence
in
the
subsequent
debate
about
rfra,
because,
in
that...
in
that
opinion,
even
though
the
compelling
interest
test
was
applied,
justice
o'connor
concluded
that
that
test
was
satisfied
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
that's
an
important
point.
congress
doing
it
does
not
open
the
controlled
substances
act
to
the
individualized
determinations
by
700
district
courts.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--a
specialized
judgment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
think
that...
we
think
that's
critical,
because
what...
just
as
in
this
court's
decision
in
laurel,
what
congress
has
done
is
to
act
to
respect
the
autonomous,
independent
institutions
of
the
tribe.
that
also
meets
certain
law
enforcement
concerns,
because
you
have
the
tribal
government,
you
have
tribal
law
enforcement
personnel,
you
have
tribal
culture
and
tradition
that
is
independent
simply
of
the
religion.
you
have...
you
have
the
entire
tribal
cultural
structure
that
congress
could
quite
reasonably
regard
as
being
different.
and
respecting
that
distinct
political
attribute
of
tribes
under
this
court's
decision
in
morton
versus
mancari,
we
don't
think,
creates
an
establishment
clause
problem.
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
on
that
limited
point,
if
the
court
applied
the
usual
standards
for
the
granting
of
a
preliminary
injunction,
i
think
that
the
court
could
quite
readily
reverse
the
preliminary
injunction
here,
because
that
requires
a
clear
showing
of
a
substantial
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits,
plus
that
the
other
factors
be
decided.
and
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
convention,
that's
really
a
question
of
law.
and
the
united
states
took
the
position
before
the
district
court
in
this
case,
that
the
convention
applied
to
the
tea.
we
think
it's
unquestionably
a
mixture,
and,
therefore,
a
preparation
within
the
meaning
of
the...
of
the
convention,
and
the...
and
the
district
court's
injunction
really
puts
the
united
states
in
violation
of
an
international
agreement
that
is
critical
to
prohibiting
trafficking--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
drugs.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in...
as
far
as
our
position
is
concerned
on
our
submission
so
far,
we
don't
think
the
court
needs
any
further
evidence.
on
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
convention,
as
we
say,
we
believe
that
is
a
question
of
law.
this
court
has
long
deferred
to
the
position
of
the
executive
branch
on
the
interpretation
of
conventions.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
we
believe
that
complying
with
an
international
convention
designed
to
prohibit
trafficking
in
drugs
is,
itself,
a
compelling
interest.
and
the...
under
this
court's
decisions
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
would
be
incorporated
in
rfra.
and
it...
a...
an
order
that
puts
the
united
states
in
violation
of
that...
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
really
deny...
a
majority
of
the
judges,
anyway...
deny
that
this
injunction
requires
the
united
states
to
violate
the
convention--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--by
facilitating
the
importation
of
drugs
from
outside
the
country.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that
exception
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this
is
a...
the
interpretation
of
the
convention
is
a
legal
question,
not
a
factual
one.
and
article
22
refers--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
but
respondent
would
bear
the...
would
bear
the
burden
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
this
is
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
is
a
change
of
the
status
quo.
and
to
require
the
government
to
allow
the
importation
of
a
substance
is
prohibited
by
the
convention.
but
if
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
i
could--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
a
convention,
where
the...
where
the
government
has
taken--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
under--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
understand
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
that
is
our
position,
and
we
cite
cases
in
the...
in
the
brief
that
say
that.
but
it
is
not
critical
to
the
outcome
of
this
case
with
respect
to
the
convention
issue
and
several
other
of
the
issues
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
i...
that
i
was
going
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
goes...
but
it
is
a
question
of
law.
and
the
article
of
the
convention
that
you're
referring
to
is...
concerns
the
penal
provisions.
in
other
words,
article
7
of
the
convention
requires
each
party
to
prohibit...
this
is
article
7,
on
page
288(a)...
requires
that...
each
state
to
prohibit
these
substances.
twenty
two
simply
goes
to
the
criminal
provisions
that
each
party's
state
will
adopt
internally
to
carry
that
out.
but
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
detract
from
the...
from
the
categorical
obligation
under
article
7,
which--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--would
prohibit
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
where
you
have
a
mixture
that...
a
mixture
of
two
plants
that
are
put
together
for
the
specific
purpose
of
using
them
for
the
hallucinogenic
purposes,
that
goes
far
beyond
simply
whether
a
particular
substance--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--plants--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
such,
are
not
covered.
but
when
you
make
a
mixture
of
something
for
the
specific
purpose
of
releasing
its
hallucinogenic
purpose...
qualities,
we
think
that
that's
clearly
covered
by
the
convention.
if
i
may
reserve
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
was
just
going
to
reserve
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may
focus
first
on
the
question
of
importation,
no
country
in
the
world
would
permit
the
exportation
and
importation
of
preparations
that
contain
a
substance
listed
under
the
convention,
because
the
express
words
of
the...
of
the
convention
prohibit
it.
and
the
commentary
that
is
cited
does...
all
it
says
it
that
plants,
as
such,
are
not
covered.
the
plants
themselves
are
not
included
in
the
schedule.
it
then
has
footnotes
describing
how
the
plants
may
be
used,
how...
in
a
mixture
or
a
solution
that
contain
the
dmt
or
some
other
subject.
and
that's
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
convention
was
designed
to
prohibit.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
don't
think
rfra
does
override
it.
what
rfra
does
is
take
the
compelling
interests
that
the
government
already
has
in
enacted
laws
or
treaties,
as
they
are,
and
then
you
apply...
you
apply
rfra
to
them.
and
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
certainly
do.
and
the
two
together,
i
think,
are
doubly
compelling,
because
the
government...
the
united
states
has
a
compelling
interest
in
encouraging
this,
and
section
801(a)--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
congress
itself,
in
the
statute
implementing
this
convention,
said
it
is
essential
to
have
international
cooperation
in
the
protection
of
the...
of
the
drugs
covered
by
the
statute.
so,
you
have
a
statutory
determination
that
this
is
critical,
anyway.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
not
at
all.
first,
the
united...
as
a
general
matter,
of
course,
the
united
states
has
a
compelling
interest
in
living
up
to
its
treaties.
but,
under
this
treaty,
in
particular,
the
united
states
has
to
be
in
a
position
to
go
to
other
countries,
maybe
countries
that
are
dragging
their
feet
about
whether
to
take
enforcement
measures,
and
say,
"you
have
an
obligation
to
strictly
construe
this
convention.
"
and
if
they
are
able
to
come
back
and
say
that
you
have...
you,
yourselves,
have
not
been
doing
that,
that
undermines
the
ability
of
the
united
states
in
enforcing
a
treaty
designed
to
prohibit
international
trafficking
in
controlled
substances.
and
nothing
in
this
court's
first
amendment
cases
would
have
suggested
that
there
is
a
free
exercise
right--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
with--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
respect
to
peyote,
the
convention
does
not
allow
the
importation
or
exportation
or
international
trafficking
in
any
substance
that
there
is
a
reservation
taken
for.
it
is
a
reservation
only
for
the
domestic
use
of
plants
that
are
native
to
that
country.
so,
peyote
cannot
be
exported
or
imported
under
this...
under
this
convention.
and
so,
the
idea...
so,
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
respect
to
the
fundamental
threshold
question
of
importation,
but,
even
so,
we
think,
in
congress's
specific
indian
power,
that
that...
that
that
could
be
different.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
in
our
view,
on
the...
on
the
legal...
now,
on
our
principal
submission,
no,
there
would
not
be
anything
further,
because
under...
in
our
view,
there's
a
categorical
prohibition
against
schedule
1
substances.
that
is
the
compelling
interest.
the
question,
then,
is
whether...
as
this
court
said
in
lee,
and
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
her
concurring
opinion
in
smith,
the
question
is
whether
an
exception
would
unduly
interfere
with
carrying
out
that
interest,
or
whether
it
would
be
a
least
effective...
less
effective
means,
in
terms
of
being
less
effective.
and
we
think
there's
no
question
that
any
exception
to
a
categorical
bar
would
violate
that
standard.
