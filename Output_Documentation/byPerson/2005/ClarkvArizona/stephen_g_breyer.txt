g.

no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
they
have
here...
the...
what
the
sg
says...
which
seems
right
to
me,
and
i
would
like
you
to
explain
why
it
wasn't...
is
that
as
far
as
the
insanity
defense
is
concerned,
that
everyone
in
arizona
agrees
that
you
consider
whether
he
knows
right
from
wrong
in
respect
to
this
act.
thus,
if
he
thinks
the
truckdriver
is
an
alien,
or
he
thinks
he's
an
animal,
and
has
a
serious
mental
problem
in
knowing
what's
going
on,
that
comes
right
in,
as
it
did
here,
because
it's
relevant
to
whether
he
knew
it
was
right
or
wrong
to
shoot
this
person.
and,
therefore,
once
i
read
that,
i
thought
there
is
not,
at
least
in
this
case,
a
question
of
whether
the
insanity
defense
is
complete,
because
it
is.
everything
that
you
wanted
to
introduce
was
introduced.
and,
indeed,
it
was
considered,
properly,
under
the
insanity
defense.
and
if
you
had
convinced
the
jury,
you
would...
or
the...
i
guess,
the
jury...
you
would
have
won
on
that.
now,
am
i...
what's
wrong
with
what
i've
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i'm
interested
in
arizona,
remember.
i'm
not...
what
i'm
interested
in
is
whether
if
you
say,
"judge,
i
am
going
to
prove
the
following.
"
"my
client
knows
right
from
wrong,
in
general,
but
he
thought
that
the
truckdriver
was
a
wild
animal,
and
that
delusion
meant
that
he
is
so
insane,
he
could
not
have
formed
the
necessary
intent.
"
the
judge
replies,
"you
can
bring
that
in,
because
if
he
thought
the
driver
was
a
mental...
was
a
wild
animal,
he
did
not
know
right
from
wrong
in
respect
to
this
killing.
"
now,
is
that
what
happened--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
effect?
or
would...
did
the
judge
say,
"you
may
not
introduce
that
evidence,
because
it
is
not
relevant?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
fine.
so,
then,
what
is...
would...
if
he
thought
it
was
a
wild
animal,
then
he
would
not
have
known
right
from
wrong
in
respect
to
killing
that
individual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
whether
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then,
what
do
you
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
if
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
the
arizona
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
writes
that
it
turns
on
the
finding
of
criminal
responsibility
at
the
time
of
the
criminal
offense.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
a
defendant
who
did
not
appreciate
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
act
he
committed
would
reasonably
be
able
to
perceive
that
the
act
was
wrong.
now,
those
words,
written
by
the
arizona
court,
suggested
to
me
that,
in
the
case
of
the
lemon
you're
talking
about,
or
in
the
case
of
the
individual
who
thinks
that
the
truckdriver
was
a
martian,
they
would
say
he
does
not
know
right
from
wrong,
here,
now,
in
this
case.
that,
it
seemed
to
me,
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
wrote.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
that's
what
they
wrote,
then
they
don't
adopt
the
test
you're
attacking;
rather,
they
do
let
the
very
evidence
that
you
want
to
come
in,
come
in,
and
it
is
totally
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
suppose
he
did,
he
believed
there...
it's
an
alien,
which
is
not
immoral,
to
kill
an
alien,
let's
say,
if
he
comes
from
mars.
i
don't
know
about
the
morality
of
that,
but--
[laughter]
--i'll
go
with
you.
i'll
say
that
you're
absolutely
right
about
that.
now,
suppose,
in
addition,
the
judge
did
consider
that.
he
did
consider
it,
because
he
thought
the
person
wouldn't
know
right
from
wrong
if
he
thought
this
was
an
alien.
all
right?
a
space
alien.
now,
suppose
that's
true.
then
what
is
the
problem,
from
a
due
process
point
of
view?
after
all,
you
were
able
to
make
your
claim
there.
the
judge
would
have
heard
the
evidence.
and
if
the
judge
believed
that
that
was
so,
he
would
have
acquitted
the
individual.
does
there
remain
a
due
process
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually,
i
was--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
suppose--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
read
state
v.--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--mott--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
that's
a
different
question.
if,
in
fact,
it
came
in
via
the
insanity
defense,
i
guess
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
prove
it.
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
true?
well,
if
it
comes
in
via
mens
rea,
then
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
disprove
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
the
state
have
to
prove,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
if
it
came
in
via
mens
rea,
that
the
mens
rea
was
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so,
the
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--would
have
to
show
that,
in
fact,
he
was
not
so
insane
as
to
preclude
intent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
present
a
serious
constitutional
question,
wouldn't
it?
or
what...
i
mean,
i...
that's...
but
i
thought
some
of
these
questions
might
be
in
this
case,
but
i
now
doubt...
i'm
having
doubts
about
that.
but
suppose
the
state
so
limits
the
defense
that
an
individual
defendant,
who,
by
any
ordinary
psychiatric
test,
would
be
viewed
as
seriously
insane,
and,
therefore,
not
a
person
who
is
capable
of
being
held
responsible
in
any
moral
sense
for
the
crime,
is,
nonetheless,
going
to
be
convicted
of
murder?
i
mean...
and
that
might
be...
come
up
with
irresistible
impulse,
because
the
person
is
totally
insane,
not
like
any
other
human
being.
anyone
would
normally
say
he
lacked
the
knowledge
of...
he's
not
responsible
for
what
he
does.
and
then,
the
state,
nonetheless,
convicts
him
of
murder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
he
knew
right
from
wrong,
if
they...
so,
i
mean,
he...
it's
not
his
intellectual
capacity
that's
wrong,
it's
his
ability
to
control
his
impulse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
not
in
this
case,
i
agree
with
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
a
variation
of
that
in
this
case...
namely,
the
variation...
but
we've
discussed
that
at
length,
and
i
take
it
you
think
that's
not
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
here,
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
do
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
we
have
to
reach
it,
this...
they're
arguing
we
do,
because
they're
saying
the
person
is
so
insane
he
doesn't
know
whether
this
is
a
human
being
or
a
sack
of
lemons.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
said
that
they
didn't
consider
that
in
the
insanity
defense.
and
he's
not
attacking
the
burden
of
proof,
at
least
not
in
this
court.
and
so,
i...
do
you
think
we
do
have
to...
that
we
have
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--assume
that
he's
right
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
"diminished
capacity",
if
it
is...
what
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
partial
responsibility
does
not...
insanity...
they
use
the
words
"insanity"
and
"diminished
responsibility".
i
took
the
word
"insanity"
to
mean
the
kind
of
mental
state
that
would,
in
fact,
show
a
lack
of
intent.
i
took
the
word
"diminished
responsibility"
to
mean
there
is
intent,
but
it's
excusable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
am
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
i...
the
best
i
can
find
in
that
court
of
appeals
opinion,
at
the
moment,
is
that
they
do
reject
the
idea
of
diminished
responsibility,
on
mott...
on
the
ground
of
mott.
that's
true.
they
say,
"don't
even
consider
it".
but
i
didn't
think
diminished
responsibility
went
to
the
question
of
whether
he
had
the
requisite
intent.
i
thought
insanity
went
to
that,
as
they
use
those
words.
what
is
"diminished
responsibility",
if
it
isn't,
"we
admit
the
intent...
we
admit
that
he
intended
to
kill
the
individual,
knew
it
was
wrong,
but
he
isn't
as
responsible
as
an
ordinary
person
would
be?
"
what
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it,
if
it
isn't
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
thought
he
was
killing
another
individual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
the
state
have
to...
does
the
constitution
have
to
let
you
off
if
that's
the
situation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
does
the
state
have
to
say,
"we
are
going
to
convict
you
of
a
lesser
offense.
"
in
the
constitution?
