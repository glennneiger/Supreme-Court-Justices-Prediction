justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
i'm
puzzled
about
one
thing.
i
just...
maybe
it's
just
my
stupidity.
but
assume
he
thought
it
was
a
martian,
and
assume
he
thought...
does
he
have
to
think
it
was
wrong
to
kill
martians?
or
supposing
he
thinks
it
is
not
wrong
to
kill
martians,
then
what
do
you
do?
does
it
matter
whether
he
thinks
it's
right
or
wrong
to
kill
martians,
in
other
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
answer.
i...
that...
is
it...
does
he...
let
me
put
it
this
way,
and
maybe
you
can
answer
yes
or
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
he
have
to
think
it's
wrong
to
kill
martians?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
that
troubles
me,
just
to...
and
then
you
can
comment
on
it...
i'm
assuming
it's
possible
they
thought
he
didn't
know
whether
it
was
a
martian
or
not,
and
that
he
thought
he
had
a
mission
in
life
to
kill
martians,
that
they're
enemies,
they're
bad
to
come,
and
he
wants
to
kill
'em.
if
that
was
the...
what
the
trial
court
found,
could
he
be
put
to
death
for
that
killing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
could
he
just
be
found
guilty
of
murder,
or
whatever,
on
those
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
there's
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--difference
in
the
burden
of
proof.
he
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
get
the
affirmative
defense
or
to
get
the...
in
that
category.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
he's...
just
raises
a
doubt
as...
so
there's
not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
knew
the
person
he
was
killing
was
either
a
human
being
or
an...
a
kind
of
individual
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
kill.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there's
just
a
reasonable
doubt
on
the
issue--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
he
be
guilty,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
as
you
say,
it's...
in
a
way,
it's...
in
a
sense,
it
comes
in
through
the
back
door,
as
you
say,
but,
even
coming
in
through
the
back
door,
if
it
raises
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
his
intent
to
kill
a...
make
a
wrongful
killing,
why
shouldn't
it
be
admissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
question?
supposing
the
evidence
is
equally
divided
on
the
question
of
whether
he
thought
it
was
a
martian
who
he
had
a
right
to
kill.
could
he
be
convicted
of
murder,
constitutionally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
knew
he
was
killing
a
human
being,
and
it
was
wrong
to
do
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't...
i
don't...
i'm
just
wondering,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
forgetting
all
the...
as
a
constitutional
matter,
can
a
man
be
convicted
of
murder
if
the
evidence
is
equally
balanced
on
the
question
of
whether
he
knew
it...
he
did
anything
wrong
and...
or
knew
that
he
was
killing
a
human
being?
