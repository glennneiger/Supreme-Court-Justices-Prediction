mr.
david
i.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
eric
michael
clark
was
denied
his
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
a
fair
trial.
arizona
law
defined
the
cognitive
elements
of
first
degree
murder
as
requiring
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
eric
clark
intentionally
and
knowingly
shot
and
killed
a
police
officer
in
the
line
of
duty.
the
state
of
arizona
was
permitted
to
offer
facts
to
circumstantially
prove
these
mental
and
essential
requisite
elements
of
mens
rea.
under
the
rule
espoused
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
state
versus
mott,
as
we
have
been
calling
it,
"the
mott
rule",
this
evidence,
as
offered
by
the
defense
both
in
lay
testimony
and
expert
testimony,
was
arbitrarily
categorically
excluded
as
a
rule
of
evidence
that's
unsupported
by
any
valid
state
purpose.
in
this
case--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--it
came
in,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
to
the
insanity
defense,
but
could
only
be
considered
if
eric
knew
right
from
wrong.
it
cannot
be
considered
because
of
the
peculiar
adoption
of
an
amendment
to
13-502,
which
is
the
arizona
insanity
statute,
that
eliminated
consideration
of
the
nature
and
quality
of
his
acts.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
if
they
were--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--as
i
understand
the
state's
argument,
they
are
adopting
what
justice
ginsburg
wrote
in
montana
v.
egelhoff,
that
the
state,
by
enacting
this
rule,
has
made
this
a
substantive
choice
to
make
evidence
of
mental
illness
irrelevant.
however,
arizona
did
not
do
that,
and
arizona
did
not
argue
that,
below.
below,
arizona
argued,
repeatedly,
that
eric
clark
knew
this
was
a
police
officer,
that
eric
clark
intentionally
shot
a
police
officer.
on
appeal,
they
argued
the
same
thing.
in
the
appellate
decision
in
this
case,
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
arizona,
the
state...
i
raised
a
challenge
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
addressing
that
issue.
and
this
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at...
one...
if
i
could
have
one
moment...
begins
on
page
330
of
the
joint
appendix...
336,
and
proceeds
through
the
court's
discussion
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
in
paragraph
17.
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
from
which
a
reasonable
finder
of
fact
could
conclude...
and
it
states,
"reasonable
inference
thereupon
that
clark
knowingly
and
intentionally
shot
moritz,
and
knew
that
he
was
a
police
officer
when
he
did
so.
"
there's
repeated
references
that
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
did
not
understand
that
arizona
had
somehow,
by
adoption
of
the
mott
rule,
decided
to
redefine
the
crime
of
first
degree
murder,
and...
as
it...
we
point
in
our
opening
brief,
they
could
not
constitutionally
do
so.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
however,
guilty
of
the
charge,
based
on
the
state's
evidence,
without
any
consideration
of
the
defendant's
evidence.
in
this
case--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--we
offered
16
lay
witnesses
and
their
testimony,
in
addition
to
the
experts.
and
i
want
to
point
this...
make
this
point
clear.
the
state
wants
you
to
believe
that
this
issue
only
involves
psychiatric
expert
testimony.
it
does
not.
and
it
involves
lay
fact
evidence,
just
as
in
any
trial.
but
these
16
lay
witnesses
talked
about--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--these
lay
witnesses--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--that's
correct.
but
the
trial
judge
ruled,
under
mott,
that
he
was
precluded
from
considering
all
mental
health
evidence,
all
evidence
of
mental
disease
or
defect,
on
the
issue
of
mens
rea.
so,
even
though
it
was
admitted,
and
there's
no
quarrel
here
that
all
of
the
evidence
that
we
sought
to
present
was
admitted,
it
was
not
considered
by
the
trial
judge.
he
could
not.
because
the
mott
rule
itself
is
categorical.
and
i
quote
from
the
mott
decision,
as
follows,
"arizona
does
not
allow
evidence
of
a
defendant's
mental
disorder,
short
of
insanity,
either
as
an
affirmative
defense
or
to
negate
the
mens
rea
elements
of
a
crime.
"
that
states
"all
evidence",
and
the
trial
judge
understood
it
to
mean
that,
and
that's
the
way
it
is
applied
in--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--arizona.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
there
is
a
distinction
between
nature
and
quality
of
one's
acts
and
knowing
whether
an
act
is
right
or
wrong.
and
the
state's
and
the
united
states
position
here
is
not
supported
by
the
history
of
the
development
of
m'naghten
nor
the
ali
version
of
the
model
penal
code.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
no--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--no,
justice...
the
trial
judge
ruled
that
we
could
offer
the
evidence,
because
we
were
not
before
a
jury,
and
the
judge
was
the
trier
of
fact.
and
he
stated
so,
that
he
would
separate
out,
for
himself,
what
he
could
consider
and
what
he
could
not.
and
his
verdict
in
this
case,
on
the
"guilty,
except
insane",
focused
only
on
whether
eric
knew
right
from
wrong.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
in
this
case--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--but
that
is
not
the
state's
point,
or...
nor
the
united
states
government's
point
in
this
case.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
their
point
is
that
the
former
is
subsumed
in
the
latter.
in
other
words,
it
makes
no
difference.
but
the
arizona
court...
the
arizona
supreme
court,
in
a
state
court
decision,
state
versus
chavez,
indicated
otherwise.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
it
would,
if
arizona
allowed
consideration
of
that
evidence.
and
it
does
not,
at
all.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
now--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--the
right
and
wrong
prong--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--in
a
hypothetical--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--in
a
hypothetical--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--and
your
question
is
whether--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--because,
first
of
all,
it
is
not
offered
and
is
not
considered
to
specifically
determine
whether
it
rebuts
an
inference
that
the
state
has
raised
on
factual
point
key
to
their
case.
secondly,
the
nature
and
quality
is
not
a
consideration
in
arizona.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
and
even
if
it
was...
and
i
would...
can
point
this
out
by
an
example
that
gets
to
what
justice
breyer
was
saying...
if
a
person
is
squeezing
a
lemon...
and
this
is
a
common
example
in
law
school...
and
it
turns
out
to
be
his
sister...
he
knows,
in
the
abstract,
that
a
person...
killing
a
person
is
right
or
wrong.
he
knows
it's
wrong.
but
he
does
not
know
that
squeezing
a
lemon
is
wrong.
in
this
case,
if
eric
clark's
evidence
showed
that
he
believed
the
police
officer
was
an
alien,
and
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
that
effect...
and
i
would
specifically
point
you
to
page
39
in
the
joint
appendix,
where
the...
where
the
expert
testified
that
eric
had
a
heightened
fear
of
police--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
absolutely.
that's
not--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--that's
not--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--the
end
of
it,
as
well.
and
the
model
penal
code
makes
this
point
when
they
talk
about
their
formulation,
which
is
a...
whether
a
defendant
appreciates
the
wrongfulness
of
his
conduct.
and
they,
in
their
discussions,
had
indicated...
and
these
are
on
pages
166
and
169
of
the
ali
comments
to
the
model
penal
code...
that
m'naghten
could,
under
any
formulation...
a
person
could,
in
the
abstract,
know
that
killing
is
wrong,
but
could
also,
in
the...
in
the...
their
subjective
mental
state,
due
to
their
mental
disease,
not
know
that
they
were
killing
a
human
being.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
that--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--they
would,
if
it
was
not
inconsistent
with
previous
pronouncements
of
this
very
same
court.
but,
although
it
is...
it
is
error
to
not
instruct
a
jury
on
both
prongs
when
arizona
had
both
prongs,
it
was
harm...
deemed
harmless
error
in
state
versus
chavez.
but
if--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--but
not--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--but
that
it
was
error,
because
they
are
distinct.
they
are
distinct
elements.
and
that
is
to
suggest
that
a
psychiatric
psychosis
is
pervasive
throughout
an
entire
person's
living.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
but--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--yes.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
the
argument
is
that
the
state
proved,
circumstantially,
his
mental
state.
the
judge,
as
the
finder
of
fact,
never...
and
stated
so
in
his
ruling
on
this
issue...
could
consider
the
lay
testimony
and
the
expert
testimony
on
whether
it
raised
a
doubt,
a
single
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
state's
position.
and
i
can
point
this
out
on
four
facts.
first
of
all,
the
state
sought
to
prove
intent
and
knowledge.
they
did
so
by
first
arguing
that
eric's
conduct,
in
driving
around
the
neighborhood
with
the
music
playing
loud,
was
to
lure
a
police
officer.
this
is
in
the
record
at...
on
august
5th,
in
the
opening
statement
by
the
state's
attorney,
page
15;
on
august
27th,
at
page
50;
and
that's
in
the
joint
appendix,
at
314,
in
their
closing
argument.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
that
it
was
equally
plausible
that
he
was
driving
around
with
his
music
playing
loud
because
he
was
drowning
out
the
voices
in
his
head,
which
were--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--and
that
is
unconstitutional,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
first
of
all--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--these
are
facts--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--no,
not
the
defense.
there's
a
very
subtle,
but
important,
distinction
between
the
diminished
capacity
defense
as
an
affirmative
defense
and
diminished
capacity
evidence.
and
it's
a
shame
that--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--well,
the
burdens
of
proof
goes
to
whether,
if
we
did
not...
if
we
did
not
prevail...
or
we
did
prevail
on
the
second
issue,
the...
whether
m'naghten
allows
consideration
of
this...
whether
it
makes
a
difference.
in
that
situation,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
us,
by
clear
and
convincing--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--no,
it's
not.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
but
the--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--if
it
is
framed
as
a
defense,
yes,
but
if--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--it
is
framed--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--as
simply--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--they...
evidence--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--the
unconstitutionality
of
that...
of
that
procedure
is
that
the
state's
evidence
goes
uncontested.
the
state's
evidence...
the
state's
evidence...
and
this
has
been
fundamental
to
prove
mens
rea,
along
with
actus,
is
a
fundamental
right
of
the
defendant
to
present
a
defense
to
that.
and
we're
talking
about
presenting
facts,
not
having--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--a
psychiatrist
get
up
there--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--and--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--but
their
justifications
for
this
rule,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
that
it's
not
reliable.
and
it
is
reliable
evidence.
both
the
lay
testimony
and
expert
testimony
is
admitted
by
the
state
for
other
purposes,
as
well
as
for
the
defense
in
other
purposes,
and
has
been
found
reliable.
and
this
is
cited
in
footnote
15
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
absolutely,
your
honor.
our
position...
and
i
stated
this,
in
fact,
in
my
opening
statement
to
the
court,
as
well
as
in
our
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
after
the
close
of
the
state's
evidence...
was
that
if
the
court
found
that
the
state
had
failed
to
prove,
considering
all
the
evidence,
including
the
evidence
of
his
mental
illness,
that
he
did
not
know
he
was
killing
a
police
officer,
then
he
would
be
found
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
or
manslaughter.
and
that
would
be
our
position
as
to
why
this
is
unconstitutional,
in
part,
because
the
state
chose
to
define
a
specific
crime
as
requiring
that
cognitive
element
that
he
knew
he
was
killing
a
police
officer
and
then--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--sought--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--to
preclude
any
consideration
of
evidence
that
indicated
the
contrary.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
"second
degree
murder"
is
defined
as
intentional
murder,
without
premeditation.
that's
one
form
of
second
degree
murder
in
arizona.
now,
i
want--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--to
get
back
to--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--because
if
he
knew
he
was
killing
what
he
believed
to
be
a
alien
who
had
taken
over
a
human
form,
then
he
may
have
known
that
he
was
killing
somebody,
but
not
that
it
was
a
police
officer,
because,
in
his
mind,
he
believed
that
the
police
officer
was
an
alien.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
no,
justice
scalia,
but
he
was
not
charged
with
a
premeditated
murder.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
as
intentional
murder.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
because
the...
because
the
crime
of
second
degree
murder...
because
this
is
a
unique--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--right.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
does
not
go
to
premeditation.
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
he
knowingly
killed
a
police
officer.
if
you
take...
second
degree
murder
is...
includes
all
the
elements
of
this
particular
first
degree
murder
statute
and
adds
one,
and
that
one
element
is
knowledge
and
intent
to
kill
a
police
officer.
and
that's
the
additional
element
that
makes
second
degree
a
lesser
included
defense
of
first
degree.
and
the
judge
was
precluded
from
considering
the
fact
evidence
in
this
case
that
indicated
that
eric
was
delusional,
that
he
was
schizophrenic,
that
he
was
actively
delusional
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
and
he
believed
that
its...
our
town
had
been
inhabited
by
aliens.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
not
if
it
could
be
considered
as
to
going
to
the
element,
no.
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
it
does
not
go
to
the
mental
state,
in
this
case,
because
arizona
law,
under
state
v.
mott,
precludes
its
consideration
for
that
purpose--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--for
any
purpose
other
than--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--whether
we
made
the--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--other
than
whether
we
meet
our
burden
of
proving
he
is
insane,
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
it
does.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
that's
the
way
the
arizona--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--yes.
yes.
well,
that's
the
way
the
arizona
rule
is
drafted.
it
can
go
to...
if
we
can
convince
the
trier
of
fact
that
it...
that
his
delusions
prevent
him
from
knowing
the
nature
and
quality
of
his
acts,
if
that
was
actually
included
in
our
statute.
but,
in
our
case,
we
were
limited
to
trying
to
prove
his
delusional
behavior,
his
delusional
beliefs
that
the
officer
was
an
alien,
to
show
that
he
did
not
know
right
from
wrong.
and
that
was
it.
and
that
places
the
burden
on
us,
which
runs
counter
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
criminal
law
that
are
set
down
in
winship,
that
it's
the
state's
burden
to
prove,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
every
element,
including
this
element,
and
not
without
any
opportunity
of
the
defense
to
rebut
that
element.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
correct.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
no,
the
burden's
not
on
the
state
to
disprove
it,
justice--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--absolutely.
the
burden
never--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--shifts
from
the
state.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
in
a
technical
sense,
yes.
but,
as
a
practical
matter,
no,
because
the
state
would
be
offering
all
of
their
evidence,
as
they
did
here,
to
show
that,
circumstantially,
he
had
the
intent.
we
would
be
offering
the
evidence,
which
is
regularly
accepted
and
is
found
reliable
for
numerous
purposes
in
our
state,
to
show
that
there's
a
doubt
as
to
whether
he
had
that.
and
that's
a
completely
different
thing
than
the
state
attempting...
having
the
burden
on
them
to
disprove
it,
which
this
court
has
so
said
in
affirmative
defense
cases
involving
self
defense,
for
example,
that
the
state
does
not
have
to
disprove
that
a
person
was
justified
or
had
a
reasonable
belief
for
their
safety,
but
that
they...
and
in
the
same
token,
you
cannot
prevent
the
jury
from
considering
whether
that
raises
a
doubt
as
to
the
state's
case.
and
that
is
the
fundamental
problem,
the
fundamental
due
process
violation
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
there
is
a
due
process
guarantee
that
the
defendant
can
present
evidence
in
his
own
defense.
no
matter
how
the
chambers
line
in
the
cases
reviewed
by
the
court,
this
court
made
clear,
in
montana
v.
egelhoff,
that
in
the
absence
of
any
valid
state
justification...
and
i'm
quoting
now,
from
the
plurality
decision...
"exclusion
of
exculpatory
evidence
deprives
the
defendant...
it's
very
basic
to
have
the
prosecutor's
case
encounter
and
survive
the
crucible
of
meaningful
adversarial
testing.
"
and
that--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--it's
the
difference
between--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
it's
not
that
we're
asking
to...
this
court
to
affirmatively
rule
that
all
of
this
evidence
comes
in,
just
that
all
of
it
cannot
be
excluded,
per
se,
and
that
the
trial
judge
is,
just
as
in
any
other
type
of
evidence,
any
other
fact
or
opinion
evidence,
serves
as
the
gatekeeper
under
the
rules
of
evidence
to
decide
whether
it's
more
prejudicial
or
it's
more
probative.
but
arizona
has
decided,
only
for
this
purpose,
that
this
evidence
is
inherently
unreliable.
and
then
they've
taken
it
to
the
point
where
they
have
proven
somebody
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
of
killing
a
police
officer
without
allowing
him
to
raise
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
he
knew
he
was
killing
a
police
officer.
and
that
specific
argument
was
made,
contrary
to
what
the
solicitor
just
stated,
in
my
motion
for
directed
verdict
that
i
made
in
this
case.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
whether
it
was
a
police
officer.
i
moved
the
court
for
a
directed
verdict
at
the
close
of
the
state's
evidence,
and
argued
to
the
court
that
if
he
found...
the
judge,
as
the
factfinder...
that,
in
his
delusional
mind...
and
again
reurged
this
at
the
close
of
our
evidence...
that
he
believed
he
was
killing
a
police
officer,
then
the
court
could
find
him
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
or
manslaughter.
and
i
asked
the
court
to
do
that,
and
the
court
refused
to
do
that.
so,
the--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--court
precluded
any
consideration
of
this
evidence.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
it's
not--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--it's
a
fact
that...
a
fact
that
he
did
not
know
he
was
killing
a
police
officer.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
correct.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
or
an
alien.
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
it's
not
"let
you
off",
with
all
due
respect.
it's
"judge
somebody
based
on"--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--"#
their
personal"--
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
--"#
culpability".
mr.
david
i.
goldberg
the
state...
the
state
has
to
allow
the
defendant
to
present
his
evidence
and
have
it
considered,
if
it's
relevant,
nonprivileged,
and
reliable,
for
a
proper
purpose.
and
here,
it
was
offered
for
a
proper
purpose,
just
as
in
chambers
and
in
rock,
and
in
all
the
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court,
where
this
court
has
held
so.
i
wanted
to
add...
answer
one
question
that
was
raised
earlier
about
whether
a
state
could
define
"murder"
without
a
requisite
mens
rea,
essentially,
which
is...
or
a
specific
intent,
as
the
state
seems
to
suggest
that
arizona
has
done,
inferentially,
under
the
mott
decision.
this
court
held,
in
1895,
in
davis
versus
united
states,
that,
"no
one"...
and
i'm
quoting
here...
"no
one,
we
assume,
would
wish
either
the
courts
or
juries,
when
trying
a
case
of
murder,
to
disregard
the
main
principle
existing
at
common
law
and
recognized
in
all
cases
tending
to
support
the
charge
below
to
make
a
complete
crime
cognizable
by
human
laws,
which
includes
mens
rea
and
an
actus
rea.
