mr.
randall
m.
howe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
the
answer
to
both
questions
before
this
court
today,
do
states
have
the...
have
the
discretion
to
define
it...
to
define
the
affirmative
defense
of
insanity
as
the
policymakers
see
fit?
and
they
also
have
the
right
to
protect
that
definition
by...
as
justice
souter's
questions
indicated...
from
an...
from
an
attack
on
that
definition
by
having
evidence
of
diminished
capacity
of
a
different...
a
different
definition
of
"insanity"
from
coming
in
the
back
door.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
i...
no,
your
honor.
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
answer
is
that
the
m'naghten
definition
of
"insanity",
the
heart
of
it,
has
always
been
the
right/wrong
test.
and
this
court,
in
leland,
and,
i
believe,
in
powell,
as
well,
have
in...
have
always
referred
to
m'naghten
as
the
"right/wrong
test".
state
courts
across
the
country,
they
go--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
as
the
lower
courts
spoke
in
m'naghten,
we
don't
look
at
the...
at
the...
at
the
act
in
the
abstract.
as
the...
as
the
solicitor
general's
brief
points
out,
it
says
in
here,
at
page
16,
that
what
the
traditional
m'naghten
test
looks
at
was
his
very
conduct.
and
as
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
noted,
it
would
be...
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
situation
where
someone
would
know
his
conduct
was
wrong,
but
not
know
the
nature
of
his
act.
and
i
won't
pretend
that
perhaps
in
some
theoretical
hypothetical
scenario
that
might...
you
know,
that
might
occur.
but
it's
very
difficult,
indeed,
to
imagine
that.
and
the
arizona
legislature
rationally
could,
you
know...
could
have,
you
know,
decided
that
they
will...
that
they
will
reduce
the
definition
to
the
heart
of
m'naghten,
which
is
right/wrong,
because
the...
you
know,
the
issue
of...
will
rarely,
if
ever,
come
up.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
and
so--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--and
i've...
you
know,
i've
worked
with
this
case
for
several
months,
your
honor,
and
i
haven't
come
up
with
one
either.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
no,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
the
heart
of
the
m'naghten
test
is
knowing
right
from
wrong.
and
if
a
state,
in
its...
in
its
discretion,
wants
to
say
that
those...
that
the
state
will
not
account
for
those
rare
cases
where
it
might
make
a
difference,
a
state
could
do
that.
the
second
answer,
your
honor,
is,
as
m'naghten
says,
at
page
723,
what
we
look
at
when
we're
examining
whether
the
defendant
knew
right
from
wrong,
is
his...
is
the
very
conduct
that
he
committed.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
my
point,
your
honor,
is,
if
he
is
not
actually
killing
a
space
alien,
there
is
grave
doubt
that
he
would
understand
his
conduct,
and
that
would
make
rather
meaningless,
at
some
practical
level,
asking
the
question,
"did
you
know
that
your
conduct
was
wrong?
"
mr.
randall
m.
howe
sure.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
no,
your
honor.
what
he...
what
he
has
to
understand
is
what
he
is
actually
doing.
and
if
he
doesn't
actually
understand
that
he
is
killing
a
human
being,
then
it's
rather
academic,
in
abstract,
to
ask,
"did
you
know
whether
that...
did
you
know
what
you
thought
you
were
doing
was
wrong?
"
but
at...
you
know,
but,
again,
i
suppose,
hypothetically,
there
may
be...
you
know,
there
may
be
a
case
where
that
would
make
a
difference.
but
the
state
is
clearly
free
to
recognize
that
that's
an
incredibly
rare
circumstance
and
that,
"as
a
matter
of
policy,
we're
not
going
to
clutter
up
the
definition
of
"insanity"
with
that.
"
it
could...
you
know,
adding
that
language,
a
policymaker
could
very
well
decide
that
would
be
distracting
to
a
jury
or
a
factfinder.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
that
would
raise
serious
eighth
amendment
concerns,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--if
he
truly
believed
that
he
was
shooting
an
alien
when
he
was
actually
shooting
a
human
being,
he
would...
he
would
certainly
have,
you
know,
a
very
strong
case
for
insanity.
but
what
the
factfinder
found
here
was
that...
but...
was
that
his...
was
that
his
evidence
that
that's
what
he
thought
he
was
doing
was--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--insufficient.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
surely.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
well--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--well--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--well,
your
honor,
that
raises
the
second
issue
that
we're...
that
we're
discussing
today,
that,
you
know,
the
state,
as
i've
argued,
has
the
right
to
define
"insanity"
as
it...
as
it
sees
fit.
and
if
you...
if
you...
if
a...
if
a
state
allows
evidence,
that
doesn't
rise
to
the
standard
of
insanity,
to
come
in,
then
you...
then
he's
able
to
raise
whatever
his
personal
definition
of
"insanity"
is
through
the
back
door.
and
the
state
has
a
great
interest
in
preserving
its
definition
of
"insanity",
and
its
ability
to
define
"insanity"
as
it
sees
fit
by,
as
we
argued--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--it
should...
it
isn't...
it
isn't
admissible,
your...
a
state
can
preclude
it,
your
honor,
because
the
state
has
the
definite
right
to
define
the
element
of
mens
rea,
and
it
is...
again,
as
it
sees
fit.
and
as--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--it--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--evidence
of
mental
disease
or
defect,
whether
it's
expert
testimony
or
lay
testimony,
does
not
come
in
under
mott.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
what
the...
what
the
state
proved
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that,
at
least,
you
know,
2
weeks
prior
to
the
murder,
he
indicated
a
desire
to
do...
to
do
something
extremely
similar
to
what
he...
you
know,
to
what
he
actually
did.
there
was
testimony
he
had...
he
had
an
extreme
dislike
toward
police
officers.
on
the...
at
the
time
of
the
killing,
officer
moritz
was
in...
was
in
a
marked
police
car,
he
had
a
uniform,
he
turned
on
his
lights
and
siren,
and
clark...
you
know--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--pulled
over.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
yes--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--your
honor.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
sure.
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
recognized
in
mott
was...
what
the
arizona
legislature
did
when
it
enacted
its
criminal
code
and
it
defined
its
mens
rea,
it
defined
the
mens
rea
in
such
a
way
policy...
you
know,
just
as
you...
you
know,
just
as
you
explained
in
egelhoff,
your
honor,
that
the...
that
the
condition
of
mental
disease
or
defect
does
not
negate
the
mens
rea.
so,
what
the
state
has...
what
the
state
has
to
prove,
in
general,
and
had
to
prove
in
this
specific
case,
is,
the
state
had
to
prove
that
clark
either,
one,
actually
had
the...
had
the
intent
to
kill
a
police
officer,
at
least
knowing
he
was
a
police
officer,
or
killed
under...
or
killed
under
circumstances
that
would
indicate
that
he,
knowing...
at
least
knowingly
killed
a
police
officer,
but
for
his
mental
illness.
it's--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--i...
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
to
answer
that,
your
honor.
what
we...
what
we've
argued,
the...
you
know,
as
far
as
the
first
issue,
is
that
a
state
is
free
to
define
"insanity"
as
it...
as
it
sees
fit,
under
most,
if
not
all,
cases...
or
most,
if
all
real
cases.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
surely,
your
honor.
this
court
has
always
noted
that
evidence
of
mental
disease
or
defect
is
viewed
quite
skeptically,
because
lawyers
and
psychiatrists
and
psychologists
very
often
can't
agree
on
the
meaning
or
the
value
or
the
validity
of
psychiatric
evidence.
the
state
also
has
an...
has
an
interest
in
preventing
someone,
who
has...
you
know,
who...
there's
at
least
a
serious
question
of
mental
illness,
from
being
able
to
forgo
an
insanity
defense,
but
raise
evidence
to
negate
mens
rea,
in
the
hopes
that
he
would
walk
free
instead
of
being
found
"guilty,
except
insane",
and
sent
to
the
state
hospital.
there's
also...
you
know,
a
third
policy
reason,
that,
because
you...
in
your...
because
the...
you
know,
because
the
gross
question
of
whether
someone
is
insane
or
sane
is
a
difficult
enough
question
with
psychiatric
evidence,
it
raises...
it
raises
the
question
to
a
whole
other
level
of
complexity
to
ask
the
juries,
"well,
if
we...
if
you
find
that
he
is
sane,
but
he
has
some
degree
of
mental
illness,
just
find...
you
know,
just
how
did
that
mental
illness
affect
his
ability
to
intend.
"
and
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
you
know,
may
properly
say,
"that
is...
you
know,
we're
finally
able
to
determine
whether
someone's
insane
or
not.
"
but
it's
just
too
complex
a
question
to
ask
the...
a
jury
or
a
judge,
as
in
this
case,
to
make
fine
gradations
of
ability
and
responsibility.
mr.
randall
m.
howe
your
honor,
my
time
is
up.
may--
mr.
randall
m.
howe
--surely.
what...
under
arizona
law,
if
you
have
a
mental
illness,
that
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
insanity
if
the...
if
the...
if
the
trial
court
or
the
jury
finds
that
circumstance
exists
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
it
can
be
found
as
a
mitigating
circumstance,
that
he...
that
can,
in
a
given
case,
reduce
the
sentence
imposed.
thank
you
very
much.
