mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
arizona
has
decided
to
adopt
a
particular
form
of
the
insanity
defense,
and
it
has
also
decided
to
protect
that
substantive
decision
by
channeling
evidence
about
a
defendant's
mental
capacity
into
an
affirmative
defense
with
the
burden
squarely
on
the
defendant.
neither
aspect
of
that
judgment
violates
the
federal
constitution.
and
i
think,
with
respect
to
the
substantive
decision,
there
are
two
elements
to
it.
first
of
all,
arizona
wanted
to
streamline
consideration
of
m'naghten
and
focus
on
the
heart
of
m'naghten,
which
is
the
right/wrong
test.
but,
equally
important,
as
far
back
as
1965,
in
the
schantz
case,
where
they
first
came
up
with
the
rule
applied
in
mott,
they
also
wanted
to
not
have
a
diminished
capacity
defense
in
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
the
state...
could
the
state
do
that?
is
that
the
question?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
the
state--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
i
don't
think
they
could
do
that.
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
happened
here.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
evidence
in
this
case...
i
mean,
it
came
in,
in
sort
of
a
strange
way,
in
part,
i
think,
because
it
was
a
bench
trial,
but
i
think
what
the
trial
court
did
is
say
that,
"all
of
the
evidence
on
insanity,
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
second
phase
of
the
case,
is
relevant.
"
"it's
all
coming
in.
"
"i'm
going
to
take
it
into
consideration,
but
i'm
going
to
take
it
into
consideration
only
on
the
insanity
defense,
not
as
part
of
the
mens
rea
defense.
"
and
i
think
that
was
consistent
with
arizona
law.
what
i
think
would
be
a
harder
question...
and
let
me
just
say,
i
think
the
way
that
this
was
postured
for
the
trial
court
was
that
the
petitioner
argued
that
all
of
that
evidence
comes
in
for
consideration
of
the
mens
rea.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
but
you're
absolutely
right
to
say
that
there's
this
tradition
with
insanity,
which
is
quite
different
than
the
tradition
with
respect
to
other
elements
of
a
crime.
and
i
think
that
goes
back
to
the
common
law,
and
goes
back
to
blackstone.
and
if
you
look
at
blackstone,
and
you
look
at
some
of
the
common
law
cases
that
this
court
cited
in
its
davis
opinion,
they
describe
murder
as
having
several
elements.
one
of
them
is
obviously
killing
a
person,
and
one
is
malice
aforethought.
and
then,
some
of
the
cases
treat
a
sound
mind
as
a
separate
element.
but,
i
think,
if
you
look
at
the
history,
it's
clear
it
wasn't
a
true
element,
because
the
common
law
put
the...
it
started
with
a
presumption
of
sanity,
which
you
couldn't
have
with
respect
to
any
other
element,
and
said
it
was
perfectly
appropriate
to
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant.
and
i
think
what
the
common
law
recognizes
is
the
question
of
criminal
responsibility
or
insanity,
although
it
has
some
logical
relationship
to
mens
rea,
can
be
separated
out
and
can
be
dealt
with
in
an
affirmative
defense.
and
i
think
if
you
don't
recognize
the
state's
ability
to
do
that,
you
end
up
allowing
a
defendant
to
basically
sneak
in,
through,
as
justice
souter
put
it,
the
front
door,
all
sorts
of
watered
down
insanity
defenses
in
the
guise
of
arguments
trying
to
negate
mens
rea.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it...
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
though--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
it's
second
class.
i
think
what
arizona
recognized,
in
the
schantz
case
and
in
mott,
in
making
this
rule
in
the
context
of
rejecting
the
diminished
capacity
defense,
is
that
if
you
allow
a
defendant
to
argue,
"my
evidence
shows
that
i
lack
the
capacity
to
form
the
requisite
mental
state;
and,
therefore,
that
comes
in
on
the
mens
rea
case.
"
you
can
make
that
argument
in
terms
of
any
insanity
defense
you
like.
i
can
argue
that,
"i
lack
the
capacity
to
form
the
requisite
intent,
because
i
responded
to
an
irresistible
impulse.
"
well,
a
state
that's
decided
to
have
the
m'naghten
insanity
defense,
rather
than
the
irresistible
impulse
defense,
has
to
be
able
to
make
the
judgment,
i
submit,
that,
"we're
going
to
have
the
m'naghten
defense,
and
we're
going
to
keep
it
as
an
affirmative
defense,
and
we're
not
going
to
allow
that
defense,
that
we've
rejected,
to
effectively
come
in
through
the
front
door.
"
and,
to
use
justice
souter's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but,
justice
breyer,
they
wouldn't
convict
him
for
murder,
because
he
would
qualify
for
an
insanity
defense.
and
somebody
as
insane
as
you're--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
it's
in
this
case,
but
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you,
which
is
as...
i
think
you
can
hypothesize
a
situation
where
somebody
would
be
exonerated
by
one
form
of
the
insanity
defense,
and
not
exonerated
by
a
narrow
form
of
the
insanity
defense.
and
i
don't
think
it
follows
that
somebody
that's
in
that
margin
has
a
constitutional
right
to
make
up
the
difference,
effectively,
through
a
mens
rea
argument.
and,
otherwise,
i
think
you...
i
mean,
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
think
that
you
might.
i
mean,
i
think
you
could
say...
because
i
think
what
happened
here
is,
all
of
this
evidence
came
in
on
the
back
door
through
the
insanity
defense.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
then
he--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
question
here.
but
you
do
have
to
reach
a
related
question,
i
think,
which
is,
i
think
the
trial
court
here
very
clearly,
in
applying
mott,
prevented
the
petitioner
from
making
a
diminished
capacity
argument.
and
then--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
an
argument
that
is
basically
a
variation
on
the
insanity
defense.
it's
partial
responsibility.
it
was
basically
the
governing
law
in
california
until
it
was--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
you
can
draw
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--distinction,
but
i
do
want
to
make
clear
that
there
are
arguments
here
that
you
could
make
in
a
different
state
that
you
can't
make
in
arizona
because
of
the
substantive
decision
that,
"we
don't
want
to
have
a
diminished
capacity
defense,
and
we
don't
want
to
have
that
policy
judgment
frustrated
by
having
the
evidence
come
in
through
the
front
door.
"
and
to
use
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--souter's
example--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
he
could,
justice
stevens.
as
i
understand--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
hypothetical,
we're--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--basically--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
it
would...
it
might
depend
on
exactly
what
the
statutory
definition
of
"murder"
in
the
state
was.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
maybe
not,
justice
stevens.
it
just
depends
on
the
way
that
the
statute
deals
with
it.
because,
in
my
view
of
the
statute,
if
somebody
really
thought...
if
they
had
to
kill
a
human
being,
and
they
thought,
"i
wasn't
doing
it.
"
"i
was
killing
an
alien.
"
maybe
that
could
come
in,
on
mens
rea,
but
if--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
justice
scalia,
you
have
not
held--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that.
and
i
think...
but,
equally,
i
don't
think
a
state
would...
is
required
to
have
a
diminished
capacity
defense.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
find,
in
the
due
process
clause,
the
tools
necessary
to
superintend
those
kind--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--of
decisions.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
starts
to
confuse
the
hypotheticals
with
the
real
case,
because
i
don't
think
petitioner's
argument
was
that
they
had
no
idea
that
this
person
was
a
police
officer,
and
he
thought
he
was
killing
an
alien.
i
think
their
argument
was
much
more
one
for
insanity,
and
that
maybe
there
were
other
explanations
for
the
conduct.
but
the
psychological
testimony
here
suggests
that
maybe
he
sometimes
thought
that
his
mother
was
also
an
alien,
but
he
kind
of
knew
it
was
his
mother,
as
well.
and
so,
i
don't
really
think
that
maps
up
with
the
argument
they've
made.
the
one
point
i
want
to
leave
you
with,
though,
is,
as
justice
souter
said,
everybody
agrees
that
there's
no
due
process
requirement
that
arizona
have
a
diminished
capacity
defense.
well,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
say
that
they
have
to
have
that
implicitly
with
the
burden
on
the
state
at
the
same
time.
thank
you.
