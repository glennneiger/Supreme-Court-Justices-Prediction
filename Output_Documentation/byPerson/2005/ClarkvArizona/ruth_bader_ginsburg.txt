well,
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
do
you
make
of
the
very
name
that
the
state
gave,
not
acquitted
by
reason...
not
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
but
guilty,
except
insane.
guilty
of
what?
guilty
of
the
charge.
and
the
charge
is
first
degree
murder.
so,
even
if
insanity
is
found,
apparently
that's
defined
to
be
"guilty
of
the
charge,
except
insane.
"
therefore
not
subject
to
criminal
punishment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldberg,
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
one
thing
about
your
argument?
you
say
that
you
should
have
permitted...
been
permitted
to
introduce
this
evidence
to
show
that
this
act
was
not...
the
"act"
being,
kill
a
police
officer...
was
not
done
intentionally
or
knowingly.
but
you
seem
to
indicate
that
clark
could
have
been
convicted,
under
the
arizona
code,
of
some
degree
of
murder.
am
i
right
about
that?
and,
if
so,
what
degree?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
was
the
second...
the
definition
of
"second
degree"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
just
ask,
what...
if
the
proof
you'd
like
to
introduce
is
that
the
defendant
considered
the
police
officer
to
be
an
alien,
why
would
he
have
any
intent?
why
wouldn't
your
argument
go,
as
well,
to
second
degree?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
howe,
would
you
explain
to
me
how
the
state
has
proved
intentional...
not
intentional
killing,
but
of
a
police
officer?
if
that's
the
charge,
that
he
intended
to
kill
a
police
officer,
how
does
the
state
meet
its
burden
on
a
police
officer
if
the
testimony
on
the
other
side
is,
"i
did
not
understand
that
this
human
that
i
killed
was
a
police
officer?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
see
that
on
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
state
side,
so
the
state
has
introduced
evidence
from
which
a
trier
could
conclude
he
intended
to
kill
a
police
officer.
but
he
wants
to
introduce,
on
the
other
side,
"i
didn't
have
that
intent.
"
"in
fact,
i
had
delusions.
"
"i
thought
i
killed
an
alien.
"
but
he's
not
allowed
to
introduce
that
evidence--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
counter--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
state's
proof,
as
i
understand
what
the
arizona
law
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
howe,
one
of
the
things
that
puzzled
me
about
your
position
is,
you
said,
"under
arizona
law,
while
this
doesn't
come
in
under
mens
rea,
it
does
affect
sentencing.
"
i
think
you
said
that
the...
his
mental
state
is
properly
taken
into
account
in
the
sentencing.
and,
by
that,
did
you
mean
just
the
length
of
the
incarceration,
or
the
place
of
the
incarceration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here,
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
a
charge,
"intended
to
kill
a
police
officer.
"
it
could
have
been
just
"intended
to
kill".
and
i
think
mr.
goldberg
conceded
that
"intended
to
kill"
would
have
been
a
proper
conviction,
but
not
"intended
to
kill
a
police
officer--
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--unless
he's
allowed
to
counter
that
add
on.
