justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
take
that...
please.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
whether
it
does
or--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
what
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
it,
is
that
when
the
arizona
statute
refers
to
whether
or
not
the
criminal
act
was
wrong,
the
criminal
act
that
they
are
referring
to,
on
your
view,
is
the
act
of
intentional
killing,
period.
and
if
that's
what
they
mean,
then
it
is
irrelevant
that
he
thought
he
was
killing
a
martian.
but
if
the
arizona
reference
to
the
criminal
act
being
wrong
refers
to
the
act
in
this
case...
i.e.,
killing
somebody
you
believe
is
a
martian...
then
the
evidence
could
come
in.
so,
i
think
your
argument
means...
your
argument
rests
on
the
assumption
that
the
arizona
statute's
reference
to
the
criminal
act
being
wrong
means
the
criminal
act,
in
general,
in
the
abstract...
i.e.,
intentional
killing...
as
distinct
from
the
act
of
killing
somebody
you
believe
to
be
a
martian.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
constitution--
justice
david
h.
souter
--requires
a
diminished
capacity
defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you're
going
to
let
the
evidence
of
diminished
capacity
in,
on
mens
rea,
you've
done,
by...
as
it
were,
by
the
front
door,
what
you
can't
do
by
the
back
door...
i.e.,
by
a
diminished
capacity
defense...
because
you're
making
the
same
point.
the
burdens
of
proof
are
different,
but
you're
making
the
same
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
do
you
think
it
is
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
say,
"we
know
perfectly
well
that
it
is
much
more
difficult
for
both
cognitive
and
reason...
reasons...
and
reasons
of
character
and
training
and
so
on,
for
some
people
to
conform
themselves
to
the
criminal
law
than
others.
"
"we
know
it's
harder
for
some
than
others.
"
"but
we
don't
care
how
much
harder
it
is,
unless
it
gets
to
the
point
that
we
define
as
insanity.
"
"because
unless
we
require
something
as
serious
as
insanity
to
excuse,
everybody's
going
to
have
an
excuse,
and
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
criminal
law.
"
--is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
what
the
state
does
when
it
denies
a
diminished
capacity...
says,
"we
will
not
have
a
diminished
capacity
defense?
"
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--with
respect,
isn't
that
also
what
the
state
is
getting
at
when
it
says,
"we
don't
allow
diminished
capacity
evidence
in
on
mens
rea,
which
is
the
state's
burden.
"
"rather,
we
allow
it
in
only
on
the
defense
of
insanity,
so
that
we
can
keep
it
clear,
clear
that
unless
the
diminished
capacity
is
so
great
as
to
amount
to
insanity,
it's
not
an
excuse?
"
and
if
that
is
what
the
state
is
doing,
is
there
any...
anything
unconstitutional
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wouldn't
it
make
a
difference
in
a
case
in
which
an
individual
understands,
number
one,
as
a
general
matter,
that
it
is
wrong
to
kill
people
intentionally?
he
also
believes
that
there
are
space
aliens.
and
he
believes
that
it
is
wrong
to
kill
space
aliens.
but
he
kills
one.
under
the
full
m'naghten
test,
under
prong
one,
he
would
have
a
defense.
but
under
the
m'naghten
test
of
prong
two
alone,
since
he
believed
it
was
wrong
to
kill
martians,
he
wouldn't
have
a
defense.
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
arizona.
eric
clark
was
charged
with
first
degree
murder
under
an
arizona
statute
prohibiting
intentionally
or
knowingly
killing
a
police
officer
in
the
line
of
duty.
at
a
bench
trial,
the
prosecutor
offered
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
mental
element
of
the
crime,
what
lawyers
called
the
mens
rea,
which
in
this
case
was
that
clark
must
have
known
that
the
victim
was
a
police
officer
and
had
intended
to
kill
him.
clark
aimed
to
rebut
this
evidence
by
relying
on
his
undisputed
paranoid
schizophrenia
at
the
time
of
the
killing.
clark
also
raised
the
defense
of
insanity
requiring
him
to
prove
that
at
the
time
of
the
crime
he
was
afflicted
with
a
mental
disease
or
defect
of
such
severity
that
he
did
not
know
that
the
criminal
act
was
wrong.
the
trial
court
ruled
that
clark
could
not
rely
on
evidence
bearing
on
insanity
to
dispute
the
mens
rea,
citing
a
supreme
court
of
arizona
decision
in
a
case
called
state
v.
mott.
as
to
his
insanity
then,
clark
presented
testimony
describing
his
bizarre
behavior
and
beliefs,
and
psychiatrists
for
both
sides
agree
that
clark
was
schizophrenic.
clark’s
expert
however,
concluded
that
the
schizophrenia
kept
clark
from
appreciating
the
wrongfulness
of
killing
the
officer,
while
the
prosecutor’s
expert
disagreed.
the
judge
found
clark
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
also
found
that
he
had
not
established
insanity.
the
judge
rejected
clark’s
arguments
that
arizona’s
insanity
test
and
its
mott
rule,
each
violate
due
process.
the
court
of
appeals
of
arizona
affirmed;
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
we
affirm.
until
1993,
arizona’s
insanity
rule
said
that
a
person
could
be
insane
on
either
of
two
grounds;
if
mental
disease
or
a
defect
left
him
unable
to
understand
what
he
was
doing,
that
is,
if
he
suffered
a
cognitive
incapacity,
or
if
mental
disease
or
a
defect
left
him
unable
to
understand
that
his
action
was
wrong,
that
is,
that
he
suffered
a
moral
incapacity.
then
arizona
amended
its
law
by
dropping
the
cognitive
incapacity
part.
we
hold
that
eliminating
the
cognitive
incapacity
part
does
not
violate
due
process
by
offending
any
principle
of
justice
so
rooted
in
our
traditions
as
to
be
fundamental.
the
varied
background
of
the
insanity
defense
makes
clear
that
no
particular
formulation
has
evolved
into
a
baseline
for
due
process,
and
the
insanity
rule
is
substantially
open
to
state
choice.
moreover,
cognitive
incapacity
remains
relevant
under
arizona’s
abbreviated
rule
because
the
defendant
who
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
when
he
acted
could
not
have
known
that
he
was
performing
the
wrongful
act,
charged
as
a
crime.
we
also
hold
that
the
mott
rule
does
not
offend
due
process.
as
to
mens
rea,
mott
restricts
consideration
of
certain
mental
disease
and
mental
capacity
evidence,
evidence
that
typically
comes
as
a
professional
psychiatrist’s
opinion
saying
whether
a
defendant
has
suffered
from
a
mental
disease,
and
if
he
has,
whether
the
disease
has
left
him
incapable
of
cognition
or
moral
judgment.
the
arizona
mott
rule
says
that
this
kind
of
typically
psychiatric
testimony
may
be
considered
only
on
the
question
whether
the
defendant
was
insane,
not
on
the
question
of
what
was
actually
in
his
mind
when
he
committed
the
act
he
was
charged
with.
we
think
this
is
constitutional;
the
constitution
prohibits
the
exclusion
of
defense
evidence
under
rules
that
serve
no
legitimate
purpose
or
that
are
disproportionate
to
the
ends
that
they
are
claimed
to
promote.
nonetheless,
trial
judges
can
limit
evidence
if
its
prohibitive
value
is
outweighed
by
a
risk
of
confusing
the
issues
or
by
a
potential
to
mislead
the
jury.
by
this
measure,
we
hold
that
the
mott
rule
satisfied
due
process.
first,
arizona
has
authority
to
define
its
presumption
of
sanity
by
choosing
an
insanity
definition
that
places
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
defendants
claiming
insanity
as
a
defense.
arizona
must
then
be
able
to
deny
a
defendant
the
opportunity
to
displace
the
sanity
presumption
more
easily
when
addressing
a
different
issue,
mens
rea,
which
the
prosecution
must
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
second,
arizona’s
rule
serves
to
avoid
jury
confusion
and
misunderstanding
arising
from
the
controversial
character
of
some
categories
of
mental
disease,
from
the
potential
of
mental
disease
evidence
to
mislead,
and
from
the
danger
of
according
greater
certainty
to
capacity
evidence
than
experts
can
claim
for
it.
for
these
reasons,
we
hold
that
there
is
also
no
cause
to
claim
that
channeling
evidence
on
mental
disease
and
capacity
to
the
insanity
issue
offends
the
principle
of
justice
so
rooted
in
our
traditions
as
to
be
fundamental.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
join.
