justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
state
telling
us...
and
we'll
ask
the
state
when
they
argue...
but
is
the
state
telling
us
that
it
has
defined
"intent"
in
a
particular
way
for
this,
so
that
"intent"
is
just
having
the
purpose
to
cause
the
result--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and,
therefore,
that
this
testimony
is
irrelevant?
is
that
the
state's
argument,
as
you
understand
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
maybe
the
question
is,
what
is
your
point?
and
i
have
the
same
question
as
justice
breyer,
and
i'd
just
like
to
pursue
that.
if
a
case,
a
hypothetical
case,
is
one
in
which
the
second
prong
of
m'naghten,
knowing
the
difference
in
right
and
wrong,
gets
to
the
question
of
his
capacity
to
form
an
intent,
isn't
that
sufficient?
i
think
that's
justice
breyer's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
let's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let's
assume
that
it
can
consider
the
evidence
as
to...
on
the
right
and
wrong
prong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
hypothetical
state--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
says,
"we'll
let
this
evidence"--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
"#
in
under
the
right
and
wrong
aspect
of
m'naghten,
but
not
under
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
act.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
that
isn't
sufficient
to
answer
your
contention
that
his
intent
is
not...
has
not
been
subject
to
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
they
said--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i'll
look
at
m'naghten.
i
had
thought
it
was
whether
or
not
the
action
was
right
and
wrong,
whether...
rather
than
the...
than
the...
than
the
moral
command
was
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
justice
breyer--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
if
justice--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--breyer's
explanation
is
a
correct
statement
of
arizona
law,
do
you
still
have
an
argument
that
your
proof
should
have
been
accepted,
on
the
first
prong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
that
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
argument
that
it...
under
arizona
law,
it
goes
to
excuse
the
conduct,
but
not
whether
the
conduct,
in
fact,
occurred?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
to
prevail,
do
you
think
you
have
to
show
that,
under
prong
two
of
m'naghten,
the
right
and
wrong
prong,
that
the
defendant
can
prove
really
everything,
and,
in
fact,
did
have
the
opportunity
to
prove
everything,
that
he
seeks
to
prove
under
prong
one?
if
it's...
do
you
have
to
convince
us
of
that
in
order
to
win?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
am
correct
in
assuming
that
it
is...
and
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
it
is
your
position,
the
state's
position,
that,
under
the
right/wrong
prong
two
part
of
m'naghten,
and
under
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
court
was
able
to
consider,
really,
all
of
the
evidence
that's
necessary
in
order
to
meet
this
defendant's
defense
as
to...
as
to
intent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
agree
with
you.
i'm
trying
to
think
of
some
theoretical
case
where
it
would
make
a
difference.
i
can't
quite
come
up
with
a
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
mean
that
it
could
also
exclude
the
testimony
from
the
lay
people
or
the
friends
who
talked
about
this
person's
illness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
are
we
just
talking
about
the
expert
testimony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
an
alternative
argument,
so
that,
if
we
accept
this
argument,
we
need
not
ask
whether
the
evidence
comes
in
under
prong
two,
or
is
this
complementary
to
the
argument
that
the
evidence
comes
in
under
prong
two?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
state
say
that
it's
the
defendant's
burden
to
show
that
it
was
not
a
police
officer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
next
question
is,
why
didn't
they...
isn't
that
what
happened
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
you
introduced
the...
my
concern
by
saying
that
they...
the
state
can
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant,
which
we
know
is
generally
true
in
many
states
with
reference
to
the
insanity
defense.
but
when
you
link
it
with
mens
rea,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
seem
as
if
the
argument,
that,
"oh,
this
all
comes
in
under
second...
under
the
second
prong.
"
means
that
if
there's
a...
there's
another
inference.
it's
a...
it's
a
secondhand
argument
about
lack
of
mens
rea.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
kind
of,
the
second
class--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--sort
of
evidence.
