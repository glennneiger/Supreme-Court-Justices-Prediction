justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
clark
versus
arizona.
mr.
goldberg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
excluded
with
respect
to
mens
rea,
but,
of
course,
all
of
the
evidence
came
in
with
respect
to
the
insanity
defense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
the
lay...
i'm
sorry.
that
was
my
question.
the
lay--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--witnesses
still
talked
about
his
mental
state,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
your
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
was
excluded
would
have
showed
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
it
went
to
diminished
mental
capacity.
and
as
i
understand
arizona
law,
it
has
decided
that
that
evidence
can
only
be
presented
in
the
context
of
an
insanity
defense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
only--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--goes
uncontested--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
only
goes
uncontested
if
the
only
way
you're
going
to
contest
it
is
to
show
diminished
capacity.
you
could
have
contested
this
evidence
by
showing
that,
you
know,
he
was
a
in
a
rock
band,
and
he
wanted
to
play
the
music
for...
to
advertise
the
concert,
not
to
lure
the
police.
there
are
a
lot
of
defenses
you
can
present.
what
they're
saying
is,
if
it
goes
to
diminished
capacity,
that
has
to
be
used
to
show
insanity
or
not...
or
nothing
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
goldberg.
mr.
howe,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
clear,
counsel,
though,
that
the
first
prong
of
m'naghten
adds
something
different,
"you
don't
understand
the
nature
and
quality
of
your
acts.
"
in
other
words,
it
would
be
enough,
if
you
recognized
both
prongs,
if
he
thought
this
was
a
martian,
regardless
of
whether
he
knew
it
was
wrong
to
kill
a
martian
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that,
counsel?
let's
suppose
that
the...
one
of
the
cases
that
come
up
is
a
language
difficulty.
the
individual...
maybe
he's
not
in
uniform...
identifies
himself
as
a
police
officer.
could
the
state
have
a
rule
that,
"we
are
not
going
to
allow
evidence
of
language
concerns.
"
that
the
individual
didn't
speak
english,
and
the
officer
said,
"i'm
a
police
officer",
so
he
didn't
know,
when
he
shot
him?
what
is
it
about
mental
capacity
that
allows
you
to
exclude
that
type
of
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can...
may
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
howe.
general
clement,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
goldberg,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
certainly
doesn't
include
the
right
to
present
any
evidence
you
want.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
couldn't
have
presented
evidence
that
this
person
was,
in
fact,
a
martian.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
in
05-5966,
clark
v.
arizona.
