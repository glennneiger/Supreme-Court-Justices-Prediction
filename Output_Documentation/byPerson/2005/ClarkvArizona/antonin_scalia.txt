but
it
doesn't
go
to
premeditation.
i
think
that's
justice
ginsburg's
point.
and
i
don't
see
why
that
isn't
correct.

no,
but
you're
saying...

saying
he
could
have
been
charged
with
second

murder--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because...
what?

justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
see
how
this
goes
to
premeditation,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia

we
ever
held
that
an

defense
is
