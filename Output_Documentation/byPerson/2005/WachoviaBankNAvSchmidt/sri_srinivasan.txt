mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
for
purposes
of
determining
its
state
citizenship
under
28
u.s.c.
1348,
a
national
banking
association
is
located
in
the
state
in
which
its
main
office
is
found,
not
every
state
in
which
it
may
maintain
a
branch
office
or
other
form
of
physical
presence.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--we...
we
don't
think
that
a
national
banking
association
is
a
citizen
of
a
state
in
which
its
principal
place
of
business
is
found,
insofar
as
that
might
be
different
from
the
state
in
which
its
main
office
is
located.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
in
part,
that's
because
of
the
historical
chronology.
the
word
located
was
first
used
in
1887
and
the
current
version
of
section
1348
was
enacted
in
1948,
which
was
10
years
before
the
concept
of
principal
place
of
business
had
any
jurisdictional
salience.
that
was
the
first
time
that
congress...
this
was
in
1958...
that
congress
enacted
a
specific
provision
dealing
with
corporate
citizenship,
and
that's
the
first
time
that
we
see
the
concept
of
principal
place
of
business
having
relevance
in
the
jurisdictional
context.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
but...
but
bougas
i
think
is...
shouldn't
govern
the
resolution
of
this
case
for
several
reasons,
and
one
that
i
think
is
salient
with
respect
to
the
points
that
you
were
raising
earlier,
justice
scalia,
is
that
it
really
is
a
happenstance
of
codification
that
the
terms,
established
and
located,
appear
together
in
section
1348.
the
paragraph
that
contained
established
and
the
paragraph
that
contained
located
were
enacted
in
separate
years.
they
concerned
separate
subjects,
and
they
were
always
treated
as
separate
provisions
until
the
recodification
of
the
judicial
code
in
1911.
and
that
recodification
stated
in
its
explicit
text
that
the
provisions
were...
were
to
continue
to
carry
the
substantive
meaning
that
they
had
beforehand
and
that
the
arrangement
of
the
provisions
were
purely...
was
purely
for
convenience.
and
so
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
because
established
and
located
happen
to
appear
in
the
same
provision
of
section
1348
that
they
necessarily
should
be
given
different
meanings.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
just
about,
justice
souter.
i...
the...
the
paragraph
containing
established
was
in
there
in
the
1863
national
banking
law,
and...
and
the
provision
containing
located
was
added
to
that
provision
in
1864.
so
the
first
time
that
they
both
appeared,
they
did
appear
together,
which
is
another
distinction
from
the
circumstance
that
the
court
faces
with
respect
to
1348.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
would
still
be
the
main
office.
the...
the
national
bank
charter...
i
think
it's
called
the
organization
certificate
under
the
terms
of
the
statute...
is
a
historic
document
that
documents
where
the
national
bank's
initial
main
office
was
located.
but,
of
course,
a
national
bank
can
relocate
its
main
office
under
12
u.s.c.
30.
and
we
think
that
when
a
national
bank
relocates
its
main
office,
it's
the
current
main
office
that's
controlling.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
even
if
its
charter
says
something
else.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
you
don't.
in
fact...
in
fact,
there's
no
provision
for
amending
the
charter.
what
you
have
to
do
is
amend
your
articles
of
association
if
you
move
the
main
office...
if
you
move
the
main
office
outside
the
city
or
town
in
which
the
main
office
previously
was
found.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
as
i
was
saying,
you'd
have
to
amend
the
articles
of
association
if
you
move
to
a
different
city.
so
you
could
look
at
the
articles
of
association,
and
those
are
on
file
with
the
comptroller.
so
i
think
where
a
national
bank's
main
office
is
located
is
readily
identifiable
and
it's
publicly
available
information.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
it's...
it's...
the
main
office
is...
is
controlled
by
where
the
national
bank
designates
its
main
office
to
be.
now,
it's
a
little
bit
different
than
corporations
in
the
following
sense,
that
with
the
main
office
of
a
national
bank,
it
at
least
has
to
be
a
place
where
the
bank
is
conducting
the
business
of
banking.
that's
required
by
the
statutes.
whereas
with
a
corporation,
you
could
conceivably
have
a
situation
where
they
were
incorporated
in
one
state--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right,
for--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--for
purposes
of
this
provision.
there...
there
are
other
provisions
where
the
word
located
encompasses
branch
locations,
but
for
purposes
of
this
provision,
we
think
location
is
synonymous
with
main
office.
and
i
would
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
in
its
opinion,
by
the
way...
and
this
is
at
pages
8a
and
11a
of
the...
of
the
petition
appendix...
that
it's
rarely
going
to
be
the
case
that
a
national
bank's
main
office
will...
will
deviate
from
the
national
bank's
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it...
in...
in
some
circumstances,
yes.
if
it
changes
its
main
office--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
same
city--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
because
it's
a...
it's
simply
a
product
of
where
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i...
i
think
so.
i
don't...
i'm
not
aware
of
any
criterion
by
which...
substantive
criterion
by
which
the
comptroller
limits
where
a
national
banking
association
could
designate
its
main
office
to
be.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes.
it...
it
has
significance
in
a
number
of
provisions.
for
example,
it
determines
where
the
bank
is
located
with
respect
to
what
interest
rates
it
might
charge
under
12
u.s.c.
85,
and
that's
an
issue
that
this
court
confronted
a
few
terms
ago
in
the
smiley
case
and
also
in
the
marquette
case.
but
there
are
other
provisions
that
refer
to
the...
the
location
of
a
national
banking
association,
and
in
all
of
those
we
think,
as
a
starting
point,
the
location
would
be
the
main
office,
and
in
some
situations,
it
would
also
encompass
branch
locations.
for
purposes
of
this
provision,
we
don't
think
that
the
location
would
encompass
branch
locations.
and
one
reason,
in
particular,
is
because
the
subject
that
section
1348
deals
with
is
the
state
citizenship
of
a
national
banking
association.
and
the
concept
of
citizenship
has
always
been
thought
to
require
a
distinctive
association
with
a
state
and,
in
particular,
has
been
thought
to
require
something
more
than
mere
physical
presence
in
a
state.
that's
always
been
the
rule
with
respect
to
national
persons,
and
of
particular
significance,
it's
always
been
a
rule
with
respect...
it's
always
been
the
rule
with
respect
to
corporations.
and
congress
defined
national
banking
associations
as,
quote,
a
body
corporate,
close
quote,
in
12
u.s.c.
24.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it...
it
could
have
a
main
office
that's
different
from
what
one
would
construe
to
be
its
principal
place
of
business
under
the
test
that
applies
to
corporations
under
1332(c),
if...
if
that's
what
you're
asking,
so
that
factual
circumstances--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
well,
i...
well,
i
don't...
in
fact,
its
main
office
is...
is
a
creature
of
statutory
designation,
but
i
think
what--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--principal
place
of
business.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
our
view
is
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
citizen
of
a
state
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business
there.
now,
i
would
say,
though,
that
it's
not
an
open
and
shut
case
because
the
court
in
a
case
that
specifically
raised
the
issue,
which
of
course
this
one
doesn't,
it
could
construe
1332(c),
which
is
the
provision
that
deals
with
corporations
generally,
as
also
applying
to
national
banking
associations
insofar
as
national
banking
associations
are,
after
all,
corporations.
but
we
think
the
better
reading
is
that
the
specific
governs
the
general,
and
therefore,
that
section
1348,
which
specifically
deals
with
the
question
of
national
bank
citizenship,
would
govern
over
the
1332(c)
which
more
generally
deals
with
the
question
of
corporate
citizenship.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
it
would
entirely
eliminate
favoritism.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
type
of
favoritism
that
we're
discussing
is
the
potential
inequity
as
between
one
state
and
two
states;
whereas
under
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
section
1348,
you
could
have
an
inequity
that...
and
it's
not
farfetched
to
think...
that
would
encompass
50
states
in
the
case
of
a
national
banking
association
and
one
or
two
states
in
the
case
of
a
state
corporation.
and
so
we're--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
they're...
they're
not
state
chartered
corporations.
they're
federally
chartered
corporations,
but
they
are
corporate
in
the...
as...
as
distinguished
from
other
sort
of
forms
that
an
entity,
an
incorporeal
entity,
may
take.
and
congress
specifically
provided
that
in
12
u.s.c.
24--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--when
it
defined
them
as,
quote,
a
body
corporate,
close
quote.
so
i
think
it
makes
sense
to
apply
the
normal
rules
that
we
apply
to
corporate
citizenship.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
they're
not
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
any
state,
but
they're
incorporated
under...
under
the
national
bank
act.
they're
federally
chartered
corporations
like
other
federally
chartered
corporations.
and
so
in
that
sense,
we
think
it
makes
sense
to
apply
the
normal
rules
that
apply
to
corporate
citizenship
to
national
banks.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
if
i
could
just...
just
briefly.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
federally...
national
banks
are
federally
chartered
corporations
and
they
share
the
salient
characteristics
of
a
corporation,
i.e.,
there's
limited
liability
for
shareholders...
and
that's
at
12
u.s.c.
64(a)...
and
they
have
a
perpetual
existence
in
the
same
way
that
corporations
do,
and
that's
at
12
u.s.c.
24.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that...
that's
our
view,
but
again,
i'm...
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
an...
as
an
open
and
shut
case
because
1332(c)
refers
generally
to
corporations,
and
so
one
could
reach
the
conclusion
that
1332's
reference
to
principal
place
of
business
should
also
apply
to
national
banks.
