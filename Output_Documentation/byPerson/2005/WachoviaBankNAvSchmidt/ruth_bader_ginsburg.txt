mr.
frey,
in
practice,
is
there,
as
there
often
is
for
a
corporation,
a
divergence
between
those
two
places?
you
have
many
corporations
incorporated
in
delaware
with
their
principal
place
of
business,
say,
in
michigan.
in
the
case
of
a
national
bank,
is
there
that
similar
difference
that
what
you
call
its
main
office
or
where
it's
chartered
is
different
from
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frey,
remind
me
of
the
state
bank.
a
state
bank
is,
for
federal
diversity
purposes,
a
citizen
of
two...
two
places
or
only
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
would
be
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--its
place
of
incorporation
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--principal
place
of
business
if
it's
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
a
venue
statute,
as
opposed
to
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
statute,
the
venue
means
where,
where...
what
particular
court.
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
which
court
system.
they're
entirely
geared
to
entirely
different
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
its
principal
place
of
business
if
it's
different
from
its
main
office?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
principal
place
of
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
main
office
is
it,
like
1332
before
the
'58
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
did
say
1332(c)
does
not
apply
to
the
national
bank.
it's
only
one
location.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
the
question
is
why
would
congress...
let's
assume
we
have
a
choice
between
two
readings.
why
would
congress
want
to
give
the
state
courts...
the
state
banks...
state
banks...
greater
access
to
federal
courts
than
it
gives
national
banks?
what
earthly
reason
would
there
be
for
congress
wanting
to
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
with
every
state
with
which
it
has
a
close
nexus.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
in
other
words,
the
partnership...
we
have
a
corporation
where
it's
incorporated
and
congress
said
a
principal
place
of
business.
we
have
a
partnership
where
each
partner
is
located.
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
for
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
is,
which
court
system
you
go
to,
as
distinguished
from
personal
jurisdiction
or
venue,
you
have
a
notion
that
someone
is
a
citizen
of
every
place
where
it
does
the
business.
is
there...
is
there
any
other
example?
it's
certainly
not
true
of
a
partnership.
it
isn't
true
of...
of
a
corporation.
is
there
any
other
entity
that
would,
for
subject
matter
jurisdiction
purposes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--its
members.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
question
that
i
asked
you
is,
in
the
realm
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
is,
which
court
system,
federal
or
state,
as
distinguished
from
where
can
i
grab
this
person
for
personal
jurisdiction
purposes,
what
are
my
venue
choices,
is
there
any
other
example
in
all
of
title
28
where,
for
subject
matter
jurisdiction
purposes,
this...
every
place
where
it's
located
counts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
south
carolina.
it's
not...
it's
not
as
though
you're
being
sent
to
some
other
place.
the
only
question
is
whether
they
would
have
access
to
the
federal
court.
but
as
far
as
personal
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
you
have
it
in
south
carolina.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
still
be
in
south
carolina.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
access
of
national
banks
to
a
federal
forum,
based
on
the
diverse
citizenship
of
the
parties
to
the
controversy.
congress
empowered
federal
district
courts
to
hear
civil
actions
between
citizens
of
different
states
where
the
amount
in
controversy
exceeds
$75,000.
congress
further
provided
that
a
corporation,
for
diversity-of-citizenship
purposes,
shall
be
treated
as
the
citizen
of
any
state
by
which
it
has
been
incorporated
and
also
of
the
state
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
state
banks
incorporated
under
state
law
fit
comfortably
within
this
prescription.
national
banks
do
not,
for
they
are
not
incorporated
in
any
state;
instead,
they
are
federally
charted
by
the
u.s.
treasury’s
comptroller
of
the
currency.
congress,
therefore,
separately
provided
in
28
u.s.c.
§1348
that
national
banks,
for
diversity-jurisdiction
purposes,
shall
be
deemed
citizens
of
the
states
in
which
they
are
respectively
located.
what
does
the
word
“located”
mean
as
used
in
§1348?
that
is
the
dispositive
question
in
this
case.
does
“located”
signal,
as
the
petitioning
national
bank
and
the
united
states
urge,
that
the
bank’s
citizenship
is
determined
by
the
place
designated
in
the
bank’s
articles
of
association
as
the
location
of
its
main
office,
or
does
it
mean,
in
addition,
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit
held,
that
a
national
bank
is
a
citizen
of
every
state
in
which
it
maintains
a
branch?
the
word
“located”,
we
have
recognized,
is
not
one
of
enduring
rigidity;
rather,
“located”
is
a
chameleon
word,
gaining
its
precise
meaning
from
context.
in
a
1977
decision,
we
held
that,
for
purposes
of
a
now-repealed
venue
provision,
a
national
bank
was
located
and
venue
was
therefore
proper
in
any
country
or
city
in
which
the
bank
maintained
a
branch
office.
that
decision
does
not
control
this
case,
for
venue
and
subject-matter
jurisdiction
are
distinct
concepts
serving
different
purposes.
venue
presents
a
where
question,
in
what
geographical
area
may
a
case
proceed?
subject-matter
jurisdiction
concerns
the
court
system,
federal
or
state,
competent
to
adjudicate
controversies
of
a
certain
kind.
our
reading
of
the
venue
provision
at
issue
in
the
1977
case
effectively
aligned
the
treatment
of
national
banks
with
the
treatment
of
state
banks
and
corporations
operating
in
the
same
area.
by
contrast,
the
4th
circuit’s
decision,
which
we
today
reverse,
severely
constricted
national
banks’
access
to
federal
courts
as
compared
to
the
access
available
to
corporations
generally.
for
purposes
of
federal-court
diversity
jurisdiction,
a
corporation
is
not
a
citizen
of
every
state
in
which
it
maintains
a
business
establishment,
and
we
read
§1348
in
that
light.
thus,
we
hold
that
a
national
bank
is
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
which
its
main
office,
as
set
forth
in
its
articles
of
association,
is
located.
were
we
to
hold,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
that
a
national
bank
is
also
a
citizen
of
every
state
in
which
it
has
established
a
branch,
we
would
render
federally
chartered
banks
singularly
disfavored
corporate
bodies
regarding
their
access
to
federal
courts.
the
language
of
§1348
does
not
call
for
that
incongruous
outcome,
nor
does
this
court’s
precedent.
the
decision
reversing
the
4th
circuit’s
judgment
is
unanimous;
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
