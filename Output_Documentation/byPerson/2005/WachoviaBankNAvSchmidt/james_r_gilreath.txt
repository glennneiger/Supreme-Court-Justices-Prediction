mr.
james
r.
gilreath
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
follow
up
on
a
point
you...
you
were
on
about
this
thing
about
an
association.
before
i
do
that,
i
want...
i
want
to
say
so
i'll
be
sure
i
don't
forget
it.
wachovia,
according
to...
i
think
we've
got
it
in
our
papers
that
we
filed
in
opposition
to
the
petition...
has
179
branches
in
south
carolina.
but
it...
but
it
is
important,
as...
as
you
pointed
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
a
national
bank
is
not
a
corporation,
but
it
is
a
association
formed
under
federal
law.
so
there's
no
state
to
which
this
court
can
look
or
anybody
can
look
to
determine
what
their
citizenship
is.
in
fact,
in
the
langdeau
case,
they
said
it
was
a
quasipublic
institution,
national
in
character.
so
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a
state
corporation.
it's
got
no
ties
to
a
state
corporation.
so
if
it's
going
to
have
citizenship
for
diversity
purposes,
congress
has
got
to
say
how
we
going
to
figure
that
out.
and
that's
what
they
did
in
1448.
this
court,
in
a
series
of
cases
back
in
the
mid-'80's,
was
faced
with
the...
with
the
issue
of
how
do
you
determine
the
citizenship
of
a
corporation,
and
it
went
back
and
forth
but
finally
came
down
with
a
doctrine
that
said
a
corporation
will
be
deemed
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
which
it
is
incorporated.
and
then
in
1958,
congress
enacted
1332
and
added
the
additional
clause
of
principal
place
of
business.
now,
given
that
it
is
a
national
association
and
it's
not
a
state
corporation,
it
was
necessary
for
congress
to
legislate
and
enact
a
statute
so
we
could
determine
how
it
would
have
diversity.
and
that's
what
they
did
in
28-1448.
and
going
to
the
question
justice
scalia
asked,
do
we
have
to
go
back
and
look
at
all
of
this
statutory
history...
and
you
can
believe
i've
been
looking
at
it
a
lot
more
than
i'd
like
to
have
lately.
it
kind
of
ruined
my
holiday.
[laughter]
but
i
think
i
understand
it.
and
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
you
do
not.
when
congress
enacts
a
statute
that
says
you
are
deemed
to
be
a
citizen
of
a
state...
let
me
be
sure
i
read
it
right
here...
deemed
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
which
you're
respectively
located,
i
don't
know
how
congress
can
speak
much
clearer.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
i
don't
think,
when
congress
enacted
section
1448,
that
they
even
knew
about
branch
banking.
the...
the...
that...
that
is
something
that
has
evolved
really
since
1994
when
the
neal
riegle
act
was
enacted.
so
the
statute
says--
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
--well,
that
assumes
that
you
want
to
give
the...
the...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you...
you
want
to
do
this,
but
that...
that
a
court
would
want
to
give
the
national
banks
what
i
say
is
a
free
ticket
to
the
federal
courts,
to
the--
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
--i
can't...
i
can't
give
you
a
reason
for
that.
i...
i
would
suggest
that
they...
they
don't
want
to
give
greater
access
one
way
or
the
other,
but
they've
got
to
write
a
statute.
and
when
they
wrote
the
statute,
nobody
had
in
mind
what
the
branch
banking
system
was
going
to
be
today.
and
so
now
what
this
court
is
faced
with
is
they
are
looking
at
a
statute
that,
when
you
read
it
literally,
says
that
they
ought
to
be
deemed
to
be
a
citizen
of
south
carolina
if
they
have
a
branch
in
south
carolina.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
that's
a
good
question.
i...
i
think
you
could
argue
either
way.
i...
i
would
say
they
probably
are
located
there
because
if--
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
--i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
even
i
could
say
that
located
goes
quite
that
far.
i'm
not
even
sure
that
back
then
the...
the
statutes
would
have
allowed
them
to
have
had
a
messenger,
but
assuming
it--
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
--you
make
it
to...
i...
i
can't...
i
can't--
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
--with
that
point.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
they've
got
a
presence
there
and
they're
doing
business
there.
i
think
they
would
be
deemed
located
there.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
that...
that's
the
way
i
read
it,
and
we...
we
discussed
that
in
our
brief,
that...
that
word.
we...
we
said
more
so
that
it
doesn't
take
away
from
the
position
that
we've
got,
but
i...
i
agree
with
what
you're
saying.
it
could
be
each
state.
and...
and
the
statute
also
says
states,
in
the
plural,
in
which
they're
located.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
i
read
it,
because
it
says
states,
that
it's
referring
to
more
than
one
state
in
which
they
could
be
located.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
i
think
what...
what
we
said
in
our
brief
was
that
the
word
respectively
is...
is
in
there
so
that
you
are
not
talking
about
all
the
banks,
but
talking
about
each
bank.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
if
i
could
move
on.
there
are
many
different
business
entities
that
anybody
can
elect
to...
to
do
business
under.
as
i
think
the
chief
justice
raised
earlier,
a
limited
partnership,
for
instance,
is
deemed
to
have
the
citizenship
of
all
of
its
various
partners.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
right.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
i
don't
know
of
any.
it's
the...
it's
the
same
for
a
limited
liability
company
as
it
is
for
a
partnership
i
believe,
that
you
have
to...
you
have
to
look
through
it.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
but
the
point...
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
it...
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
the
same
rule
that
it
is
for
a
corporation,
and...
and
that...
that's
what
this
court
decided
in
the
carden
case.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
not...
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
there...
there
is
some
authority
that
i
think
is
cited
in
their
brief
or
somebody's
brief
that
the
court
should
give
deference
to...
to
their
interpretations.
but
this
court
is
not
bound
by
their
interpretations.
if...
if
this
court
concludes
that
their
interpretation
is...
is
clearly
incorrect,
then
it's
not...
it's
not
bound
by
it.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
well--
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
--no.
i
would
agree.
in
fact,
congress
has
the
final
say
so,
and
then
this
court
has
got
to
look
at
what
congress
says
to
interpret
it.
and
congress
said,
i
say
very
simply,
that
they're
deemed
a
citizen
of
any
state
wherever
they
are
located.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
you...
you
can
make
that
argument,
but
it...
it
depends
on,
like
you
say,
what...
what
do
you
mean
when
you
ask
that
question.
if
you're
going
out
to
buy
a
ford
car,
then
you
obviously
would
want
to
know
where
it's
located
other
than
in
michigan.
you'd
want
to
know
where
the
nearest
ford
dealership
is.
located,
obviously,
can
have
several
meanings,
but
that's
one
of
the
points,
i
think,
that
judge
luttig
made
in
his
opinion,
is
you've
got
to
look
at
it
in
the
context
in
which
it
is
said
in
the
statute.
and
looking
at
the
statute,
in
the
context
in
which
the
word
located
is
there,
it
says
where...
in...
in
the
states
where
it's
located.
now,
there
are
other
places
in
the
statute,
which
i'm
sure
they
will
argue
or
have
argued
in
their
brief,
that...
that
say,
you
know,
it's
located,
when
they're
talking
about
a
bank...
a
branch
bank
where
you
can
do
insurance
or
whatever,
that
it
can...
it
can
sell
insurance
in
any
branch
where...
where
it's
located,
and
that
means
another
meaning
to
locate.
but
you've
got
to
look
at
locate
in
the
context
in
which
it's
used,
and--
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
--i...
i
agree.
a
citizen
is
a
citizen.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
well,
we...
i...
i
contend...
i
can
understand
why
you
say
that,
but
if
you
read
the...
the
statute
the
way
it's
worded
and
you...
and
you
look
at
what's
going
on
out
there,
i
don't
see
any
problem
with
this
court
construing
that
they
are
a
citizen
of
a
state
like
south
carolina
where
they've
got
179
branches.
the...
according
to
the
brief
by,
i
think,
the
aba
or
one
of
the
amicus,
they've
got
something
like
3,600
branches.
now,
they
come
into
south
carolina,
they're
taking...
if
i
bank
with
them,
they're
taking
my
money
and
the...
and
the
money
of
other
millions
of
south
carolinians
and...
who...
who
are
entrusting
their
money
to
them,
as
opposed
to
entrust
it
to
a
state
court,
and
if
i'm
banking
with
them,
i've
got
to
go
sue
them
in...
in
federal
court.
whereas,
if
i'm
banking
with
a--
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
--no.
i
think
if...
if
we...
if
this
court
adopts
the
position
the
petitioner
wants,
they
would
be
deemed
a...
a
citizen
of
north
carolina,
not
south
carolina.
and
if
i
had...
if
i
got
into
a
controversy
with
them
about
something
in
my
account,
i
would
have
to
go
file
court...
file
suit
in
a
federal
court
to
bring
them
to
south
carolina
where
i
would
be
drawing
a
jury
from
8
or
10
counties
as
opposed
if
they
were
a
state
bank
or--
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
--it
would
still
be
in
south
carolina.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
that's...
that's
true.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
that's
exactly
true.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
know
whether
i
necessarily
agree
with
that
or
with
this
parity
argument
that
they've
got.
i
wanted...
i
want
to
address
that
just
briefly,
if
i
could,
is
the
parity
argument...
and...
and
all
of
this
parity
argument
they
get
they
get
from...
from
these
1882,
1885,
1887
statutes.
all
of
those
statutes
have
been
repealed.
the
parity
argument
is
gone.
if...
if
congress
had
wanted
parity,
then
where
is
parity
in
section
1448?
it's
not
there.
it
was
there
in
1882,
1885
and
'87,
but
those
statutes
have
been
repealed.
parity
is
not
some
doctrine
or
something
in
the
constitution.
so
i
think--
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
--i
can't...
i
can't
argue
with
the
logic
that
you've
got.
but
i...
i
still
come
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
are
you
talking
about
1448?
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
i
agree
that
it
says
they
shall
be
deemed
citizens
of
the
states
in
which
they
are
respectively
located.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
the
statute
says
state...
says
citizens,
which
to
me
says
the
statute
is
allowing
you
to
find
that
they
can
be
a
citizen
of
more
than
one
state.
mr.
james
r.
gilreath
i...
i
can't
argue
with
you,
but
i...
i
still
come
back,
you
know,
to
the
statute.
i...
i
think...
i
think
the
real
problem
here
is
that
you've
got
a
statute
that
was
enacted
in
1948
that
really,
if
you
go
back
and
look,
it
goes
back
to
1911.
and
obviously,
in
1911,
nobody
knew
the
proliferation
of
branch
banking
that
was
going
to
take
place.
nobody
knew
the
proliferation
of
branch
banking
that
was
going
to
take
place
in...
in
1948
when
it
was
enacted.
and
i
think
the
real
decision
that
this
court
has
got
to
make
is
whether
you...
you
read
the
statute
and
apply
it
or
either
whether
you're
going
to
leave
it
to
congress
to...
to
make
that
change.
i'm
not...
and...
and
you
may...
you
may
apply
it
the
way
i'm
arguing,
and
i
hope
you
do.
and
it
may
be...
and...
and
if
you
do,
then
the
national
banking
associations,
with
all
the
clout
they've
got,
can
go
over
here
across
the
street
to
congress
and
they
can
get
it
changed.
and
you
can
bet
they
probably
will
be
trying.
but
i
think
the
real
question
is...
is
are
you
going
to
read
the
statute
for
what
it
says
or
are
you
going
to,
you
know,
give
it
the
reading
they
want
by
going
back
in
all
this
history
and
twisting
and
turning
to
get
to
the
point
they
want
to
get
to.
they
even...
i
think
this
is
one
point
i
want
to
make
is
if
you
look
at
their
brief,
right
at
the
last
page
of
their
brief...
and
i
think
this
highlights
the...
the
problem
that
you've
got
is
they
say
you
don't
need
to
go
so
far
as
to
determine
two
places.
they
just
want
you
to
determine
one
place.
and
i
think
that
highlights
the
fact
of
how
far
they're
trying
to
stretch
the
rubber
band
on
this
word
to...
to
get
the...
get
the
meaning
that
they
want.
they...
they
say
that
ought
to
be
left
for
another
day.
and
so
i
come
back
that
the...
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
located
should...
should
put
it
in
each
state.
the...
i...
i
think
this...
i
come
back
and
i
think
the
statute
is
unambiguous.
and
that
leads
me
to
the...
the
bougas
case,
which
was
talked
about
a
little
bit.
it's
not
very
often
that
you
have
a
statute
where
this
court
has
already
ruled,
as
it
did
in
bougas
some
28
years
ago,
a...
a
virtually
identical
statute
dealing
with
the
banking
laws.
they...
they
try
to
say,
well,
the
in
pari
materia
doctrine
ought
not
to
apply,
but
i
mean,
you've
got
a
statute
there
that's
a...
a
banking
statute,
admittedly
dealing
with
venue,
where
this
court
found
the
same
meaning
that
we
would
like
for
it
to
find
here.
the
courts...
and...
and
their
argument
about
established
and
located
completely
goes
away
because
the
court
said
whatever
the
reason
behind
the
distinction
in
those
two
words,
it
does
exist
and
we
recognize
it.
and...
and
even
if
you
say,
well,
in
pari
materia
doesn't
apply...
and
that's
what
they
argue.
judge
luttig
said,
well,
it...
it's...
still
there's
some
authority
that
similar
statutes
should
apply.
and
here,
we
have
a
decision
that's
construing
an
almost
identical
statute.
it
reaches
the
conclusion
that...
that
we
would
like.
in
summary,
kind
of
the
way
i
look
at
it
it's
kind
of
like
in
1948
the
congress
tailored
a
citizenship
suit
of
clothes
for
national
banks,
and...
and
that
suit
of
clothes,
a
pattern
of
which
was
laid
out
even
back
into
the...
the
19th
century,
still
fits
the
bill
today.
it's
old.
it's
a
57-year-old
suit
of
clothes,
and...
but
it
still...
it
can
still
work.
it
may
not
work
the
way
the
banks
want
it
to
work,
but
it
will
work.
and
if
the
banks
want
to
get
