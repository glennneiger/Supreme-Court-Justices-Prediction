chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
wachovia
bank
v.
schmidt.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
a...
a
national
bank
charter
typically
lists
the
national
bank's
principal
place
of
business.
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
its
main
office.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
isn't
that
amended
if
the
principal
place
of
business
changes?
the
charter
is
amended.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
would
put
national
banks
in
a
favored
position
compared
to
corporations--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--which
are
citizens
of
their
state
of
incorporation
and
their...
their
principal
place
of
business.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point
is
just--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--a
good
bit
of
your
argument
is
that
your
friend's
interpretation
on
the
other
side
would
put
national
banks
in
a
disfavored
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument
would
put
them
in
a
favored
position
compared
to
a
typical
corporation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you're...
you're
asking
us
to
interpret
a
statute
that
they
passed
in
light
of
events
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
saying
that
when
they
passed
it,
national
banks
were
only
in
one
place.
well,
they
were
only
located
in
one
place--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
if
you
adopt
the
reading
of
the
fourth
circuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
srinivasan,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i...
could
i
get
your
position
again
on
exactly
1348?
you
say
main
office
is
where
the
bank
is
located?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
if
that's
different
from
the
national
bank
charter?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
its
charter
says
something
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
i
gather
you
don't
have
to
amend
your
charter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how...
how
do
you
tell
where
a
bank's
main
office
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
its
main
office
would
be...
be
where
its
articles
of
incorporation
say,
even
if
it
has
90
percent
of
its
branches
in
another
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
can
have
these
banks...
i
don't
know...
presumably
a
state
that
they
bear
little
or
no
relation
to
could
offer
some
favorable
treatment
of
them
and
they
could
suddenly
say,
you
know,
wachovia's
main
office
is
in
wyoming
or
something,
even
though
it
doesn't...
it
has
one...
it
has
one
atm
or
one
branch
there.
and
that
would
be
all
right
with
you?
that
would
be
where...
where
they
were
located?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
be
the
only
place
that
they
were
located.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what...
what
do
you
mean
that
national
banking
associations
are,
after
all,
corporations?
i
thought
they
were
distinct
entities
from
corporations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
mean--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they're
not
incorporated...
they're
not
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
any
state,
though.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but...
i'm
sorry.
maybe
this
is
something
everybody
knows
but
me.
but
i
would
have
thought
that
a
national
association
is
distinct
from
a
corporation
in
a
way,
for
example,
that
a
partnership
is
distinct
from
a
corporation.
and
i
wouldn't
have
assumed
that
the
laws
with
respect
to
corporations
automatically
applied
to
national
banking
associations.
but
you
say
they
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gilreath.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it...
it
says
located.
i
mean,
do
you...
what
about
an
atm?
does
an
atm
make
them...
that's
all
they've
got
in
wyoming.
does
that
make
them
located
in
wyoming?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
have
private
delivery
of
mail.
can
you?
well,
that's
a...
but
what...
what
even
more...
what
about
a...
a
warehouse?
i
mean,
it's
where
they
keep
the...
the
money
bags
or
whatever.
[laughter]
that's
all
that's...
that's
all
that's...
and
that's
all
that's
in
the
state.
are
they
located
in
that
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
owe
any
degree
of
deference
to
the
comptroller's
interpretation
of
the
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
their...
their
hypothetical
in
both
your
friend's
brief
and
the
government's
brief
about
ford
motor
company,
not
in
terms
of
1332
but
common
parlance?
if
you
ask
somebody
where
ford
motor
is
located,
they're
likely
to
respond
by
saying,
well,
what
do
you
mean?
do
you
mean
their
headquarters?
do
you
mean
the...
the
plant
down
the
street?
do
you
mean
the
dealership?
it
does
suggest
that
located
doesn't
have
the
clear
meaning
that
you
rely
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
same
would
be
true
if
you
were
dealing
with
a
state
bank
incorporated
in
north
carolina
with
its
principal
place
of
business
in
virginia
that
had
50
branches
in
south
carolina.
the
same
thing--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--would
still
be
true.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
the
parity
that
congress
has...
that
has
been
the
guiding
principle
of
congress'
enactments
in
this
area
since
1882.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frey,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
if
there
were
the
problems
that
you
hypothesize
here,
congress
could
have
dealt
with
them
by
enacting
something
that
dealt
with
the
proliferation
of
branch
banks
rather
than
interpreting
the
1948
statute
in
light
of
1980's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
that's
not
a
rule
that
they've
adopted.
all
they
say
is
that
they're
citizens
of
wherever
they're
located.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
in
wachovia
bank
versus
schmidt.
