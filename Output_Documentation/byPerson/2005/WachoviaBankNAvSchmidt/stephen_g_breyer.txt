what...
what
about
if
we
go
back
to
1880
or
whatever
and
they
had
a
messenger?
you
know,
they
only
had
one
office,
but
they
had
depositors
in
different
states,
and
this
messenger
went
from
state
to
state
handing
out
the
cash
and
collecting
a
fee.
would
congress
at
that
time
have
considered
that
bank
to
be
located
in
all
the
states
where
the
messenger
showed
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer

post
office
was
slow.
