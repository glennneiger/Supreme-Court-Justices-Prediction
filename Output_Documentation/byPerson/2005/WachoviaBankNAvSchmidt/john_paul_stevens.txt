if
a
national
bank
changes
its
main
office,
it
must
get
the
approval
of
the
comptroller
to
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
sort
of
circumstance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
say
want
to
open
a
branch
in...
just
a...
just
a
one
window
branch
in
wyoming
and
make
that
the
main
office.
would
there
have
been
any
reason
why
they
couldn't
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
other
words,
the...
the
comptroller
would
automatically
approve
such
a
change.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
term,
main
office,
have
any
significance
for...
for
any
purpose
other
than
this
jurisdictional
issue
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
that
is
really
a
follow
up
on
the
chief
justice's
earlier...
for
a
private
corporation,
it's
located
both
where
it's
incorporated
and
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
is
it
your
view
that
a
national
bank
may
have
two
parallel
locations
or
just
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could...
it
could
have
a...
it
could
be
a
citizen
of
the
state
where
its...
its
papers
say
its
main
office
is
and
also
the
state
where,
in
fact,
its
main
office
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
should
use
a
different
word.
where
its
principal
place
of
business--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
have
a
big
operation
in
new
york
and
a...
and
a
delaware
headquarters
in...
in
dover.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
call
your
attention
to
another
word
in
the
statute
that
seems
persuasive
to
me?
it's
the
word
respectively.
the
statute
says
all
national
banking
associations
shall
be,
for
the
purposes
of
all
other
actions
by
or
against
them,
be
deemed
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
they
are
respectively
located,
which
i
would
read
as
saying
in
which
each
of
them
is
located.
isn't
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they're
talking
about
a
plural
banking
associations,
not
just
plural
branches
of
one
association.
and
it's
in
which
each...
in
which
they
are
respectively
located,
which
strikes
me
as
saying
in...
in
which
each
of
those
national
banking
association
is
located,
which
seems
to
me
to
read
as
though
there's
only
one
location
for
each
bank.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
it
does
say
the
states
in
which
they
are
respectively--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
of
course,
it
refers
to
more
than
one
state
because
it
referred
to
even
more
than
one
national
bank
association.
it's
a
plural
associations,
and
then
it
says,
each
of
them
shall
be
deemed
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
which...
it
says
in
the
plural...
in
which
they
are
respectively
located.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
that's
exactly
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go...
may
i
go
back
to
the
textual
argument
that
justice
scalia
was
suggesting
a
little
while
ago?
if
we
presume
that
normally
a
citizen
is
a
citizen
of
only
one
place...
there
are
multiple...
there
are
other
situations
where
you
have
a
dual
citizen...
and
that
you
would
normally
assume
they're
only
a
citizen
in
one
place,
then
congress,
in
order
to
solve
the
problem
of
corporate
headquarters
in
the
private
commercial
world,
corporate
headquarters,
a
main
piece
of
business,
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
corporations
shall
be
deemed
to
be
a
citizen
of
two
places...
they
made
a
special
statute
when
they
could
be
a
citizen
of
two
places,
which
overcomes
the
presumption
that
it's
a
citizen
of
only
one
place.
but
there's
nothing
to
overcome
the
presumption
that
in
1348
they're
assuming
each
citizen
has
only
one
place
of
citizenship
because
that
statute
just
used
the
word
respectively.
it
talks
about
many
banks
but
in...
respectively
citizens
of...
of
different
states.
but
i
think
that's
fully
consistent
with
the
notion,
sort
of
the
basic
background
notion,
that
one
person
has
one...
one
citizenship;
one
corporation
has
only
one
place
of
citizenship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
this...
i'm...
i'm
relying
strictly
on
the
statutory
language
in
making
this
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
because
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
anybody
being
a...
capable
of
being
a
citizen
of
two
different
places,
whereas
1332
does,
which
is
the
unusual
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
respectively.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
but
it's
clearly
unusual
to
say
you
can
be
a
citizen
of
two
places.
and
to
do
that,
you
had
a
special
statute
in
1332.
to
say
you
can
be
a
citizen
of
40
or
50
states
simultaneously,
there
really
is
no
precedent
for
that.
