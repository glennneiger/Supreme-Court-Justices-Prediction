justice
david
h.
souter
in
bougas,
they
were
there
to...
they
were
put
in
originally
in
the
original
drafting.
they
were
paired,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
let
me
raise
the
reality
check
question.
if...
if
we
assume
that
that
is
not
the
only
possible
reading
of
that
statute,
why
in
the
world
would
congress
have
wanted
to
impose
the...
the
system
that
follows
from...
from
your
result
in
which
the...
the
national
banks
are...
are
excluded
from
diversity
jurisdiction
to
a
degree
that
the
state
banks
clearly
are
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
i
guess
the
problem
is
if...
if
we
start
with
the
assumption
that
i
made
a
second
ago
that
your
reading
is
not
a
necessity...
it's
a
possible
reading.
no
question
about
it.
but
if...
if
we
assume
that
it's
not
an
absolute
necessity,
we...
we
try
to
avoid
freakish
results,
and
this
seems
like
a
freakish
result.
and
i
take
it
your
answer
is
it
may
be
a
freakish
result.
we're
not
claiming
that
congress
intended
it.
but
that
still
leaves
us,
i
think,
with
the
problem
of
a...
a
reading
which
is
not
absolutely
necessary
that
does
produce
a
freakish
result.
and
if
that's
the
case,
why
shouldn't
you
lose?
