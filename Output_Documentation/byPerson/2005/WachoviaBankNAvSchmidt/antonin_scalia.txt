the
congress
makes
mistakes
sometimes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
would
say
that
the
main
office
is
the
place
where
they're
established.
is
that
what
you
think
the
word
established
refers
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
think
we
need
to
go
there,
at
least...
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
you
have
two
different
words
and
if,
indeed,
established
means
the
same
thing
that
you're
telling
us
located
means,
i'm
not
going
to
agree
with
you.
i
mean,
they're...
they're
two
different
words--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
there
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
said
we...
we
had
a
case
that
resolved
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
we
had
a
case
that...
that
answered
that
question,
not
a
case
involving
this
particular
provision--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
a
case
involving
another
provision
of...
of
the
banking
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
a
lawyer
has
to
go
back,
in
order
to
advise
a
client,
and...
and
when
he
has
a
word...
two
words
in...
in
a
provision...
one,
established;
the
other,
located...
he
has
to
go
back
and
figure
out
every
one
of
these
reenactments
and
inquire
into,
you
know,
what
congress
meant
at
the
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
he...
he
has...
he
has
a
statute
that
says
established
in
one
part,
located
in
another,
and
he
has
a
supreme
court
case,
which
i
mentioned,
but
you
apparently
disregard,
which
is
bougas,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
which...
when
i
asked
about
it,
you...
you
drew
a
blank.
i
mean,
that's
the
case
i
was
referring
to.
and
in...
which
had
a
similar
provision
using
the
word
established
and
located
and
said
that
established
meant
one
thing
and
said
what
in
this
case
it
meant.
now,
it
was
for
a
different
purpose,
to
be
sure,
but
if
i
were
a
lawyer
looking
up...
and
it...
you
know,
it
dealt
with
banks.
and
if...
if
i
were
a...
a
lawyer,
i
would
have...
i
would
have
said,
gee,
there
it
is.
the
supreme
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--says
where
you
have
established
and
located
in...
in
the
same
provision,
located
means
where
they
have
a
branch.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
whatever...
whatever
the
outcome,
whether
it
was
equality
or
nonequality,
and
whatever
the
rationale,
whether
it
was
the
purpose
to
be
served
or
something
else,
the
court
held
that
the
word
located
in
a
banking
statute
which
had
both
the
words
established
and
located
in
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--meant
where
they
have
a
branch.
and...
and
that
seems
to
me
a
very
persuasive
indication
for
a
lawyer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who's
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
advise
his
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
the
government
argue
in
bougas?
i...
i
didn't
look
up
the
briefs
in
the
case.
did
the
government
appear
in...
in
that
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
we
did...
if
we
did
interpret
1332(c)
that
way,
there
wouldn't
be
any
favoritism
for
national
banks.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
that
would
be
true
if
it
said
the
state
in
which
they
are...
in
which
they
are
respectively
located,
but
it
does
say
of
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
so
each
one
could
be
in
many
states.
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
a
matter
of...
of...
over
which
the
comptroller
has
administrative
responsibility,
is
it?
i
mean,
this
is
just
a
matter
for
the
courts
as
to
what
court
these
associations
can
be...
can
be
sued
in.
and
i
don't
see
how
the
comptroller
has
any
business
in
that
area.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i...
i
guess
he
deals
with
these
associations
all
the
time,
so
we
should...
we
should
listen
to
him,
but...
but
he...
he
is
not
authoritative
as
to...
as
to
who
comes
into
court,
is
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the...
the
argument
here
is...
is
in
the
context
of
deciding
which
citizen
an
entity
is
a
citizen...
which
state
an
entity
is
a
citizen
of,
we
normally
don't
think
that
entities
are
citizens
of
multiple
states.
just
as
you
wouldn't
think
if...
if
you're
asking,
you
know,
where
does
the
ford
motor
company
manage
its...
its
operations
from,
you
wouldn't
think
from
multiple
states.
so
here
when
you're
talking
about
citizenship,
why
doesn't
this
argument
of
context
cut
precisely
against
you?
we're
talking
about
citizenship.
people
aren't
citizens
of...
of
50
states.
i
mean,
that...
that's
an
extraordinary
result
to
reach.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
should
be
looking
for
one
state
or
maybe
two
states
at
most.
