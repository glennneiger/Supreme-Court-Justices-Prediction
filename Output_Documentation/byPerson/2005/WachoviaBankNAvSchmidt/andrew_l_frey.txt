mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether,
for
purposes
of
federal
diversity
jurisdiction,
a
national
xbank
is
a
citizen
of
every
state
where
it
has
a
branch,
or
perhaps
where
it
has
any
physical
presence,
or
only
a
citizen
of
the
state
where
it
was
chartered
or,
if
different,
where
its
main
office
is
located.
the
question
turns
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
located
in
28
u.s.c.
1348,
which
states
that
national
banking
associations
shall
be
deemed
citizens
of
the
states
in
which
they
are
respectively
located.
now,
before
turning
to
the--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that's
correct.
the
law--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
hasn't
changed.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm...
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
there
may
have
been
a
few
state
banks
that
had
interstate
branches,
although
they
would
have
been
citizens
only
of
the
state
of
their
incorporation.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it...
it...
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
because
of
the
sequence
of
statutes.
you
have
to
start
with
the
1882
statute
and
what
the
supreme
court
has
said.
but...
but
i'd
like
to
make
a
preliminary
comment
before
i
turn
to
the
substantive
points
here,
which
is
that
nobody
has
ever
suggested,
not
the
fourth
circuit
and
not
the
respondent,
any
reason
why
congress
would
want
the
result
reached
by
the
fourth
circuit,
in...
in
1887
or
in
1948
or
any
other
relevant
time,
to
uniquely
restrict
the
access
of
national
banks
to
federal
diversity
jurisdiction.
indeed,
the
suggestion
is
incongruous
that
congress
would
want
to
do
that.
national
banks
are,
after
all,
federally
created
and
federally
regulated
instrumentalities.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
they...
they
might
have...
they
might
have
done
that.
and
i...
i
acknowledge
that
this
consideration
is
not
controlling,
standing
by
itself,
on
the
case.
that
is,
if
the
statute
plainly
and
unambiguously
called
for
such
an
implausible
outcome,
then
we
might
have
a
debate
about
whether
an
absurd
outcome
that
the
plain
language
calls
for
is
one
that
should
be
enforced.
but
this
is
a
background
consideration
that
i
don't
think
the
court
can
put
aside
or
deem
irrelevant
to
the
outcome
of
this
case.
so
the
key
holding
of
the
fourth
circuit
was
that
the
word
located
has
an
unambiguous
meaning,
and
it's...
that
it's
the
one
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit
majority
and
not
by
the
fourth
circuit
dissent,
the
fifth
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
or
anybody
else.
the
battle
of
the
dictionary
definition
seems
to
me
plainly
inclusive.
the
biggest
problem
with
the
definitions
is
that
they
are
cast
in
terms
of
the
location
of
tangible
physical
things,
a
table,
a
lake,
a
piece
of
land;
whereas
we're
dealing
here
with
an
incorporeal
abstraction,
a
corporation,
the
location
of
which
is
not
necessarily
tied
to
any
particular
physical
presence.
both
we
and
the
government
have
given
ford
motor
company
as
an
example
in
the
brief.
if
you
ask
somebody
where
is
ford
motor
company
located,
i
venture
to
say
that
most
people
would
say
michigan.
but
when
you
stop
and
think
about
it,
it's
possible
that
it
could
be
also
located
every
place
where
it
has
manufacturing
facilities
or
sales
outlets.
the
only
dictionary
definition
that
i've
seen
that
is
specific
to
the
location
of
an
incorporeal
entity,
and
specifically
a
bank,
is
the
one
that's
cited
in
the
chase...
jpmorgan
chase
amicus
brief,
which
was
taken
from
the
1951
edition
of
black's
law
dictionary,
roughly
contemporaneous
with
the
enactment
of
current
section
1348,
which
states
that
a
bank
is,
quote,
located,
close
quote,
in
the
place
specified
in
its
organization
certificate.
the
term
also
appears
many
places
in
the
national
bank
act,
sometimes
meaning
a
specific
headquarters
location
and
sometimes
meaning
any
place
where
there
are
physical
facilities.
and
the
court...
this
court
itself
has
given
located...
the
word
located
various
meanings.
in
the
bougas
case,
which
is
much
discussed
in
the
briefs,
the
court
said
that
the
term
has
no
enduring
rigidity,
and
the
court
did
not
base
its
decision
on
the
inherent
or
natural
or
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
located.
in
federal
power
commission
v.
texaco,
which
is
377
u.s.
33,
the
court
interpreted
the
words
in
the
venue
statute
for
appeals
from
federal
power
commission
decisions
which
said
the
appeal
could
be
taken
to
the
place
where
the
company
seeking
review
was
located.
texaco
said,
well,
we
have
substantial
facilities
in
the
tenth
circuit.
this
matter
that
is
the
subject
of
this
arose
in
the
tenth
circuit.
and
the
court
looked
at
the
statute
and
it
said,
no,
located
means
where...
your
place
of
incorporation.
now--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
lists--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
lists
the...
the
charter
location,
where
it's
established.
and
until
1994,
that
would
have
been
synonymous
with
its
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
can...
just
like
a
corporation
could
reincorporate
in
another
state,
a
bank
could
move
its
main
office,
which
i
think
is
the
term
that's
used
in
12
u.s.c.,
section
30.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
there's...
i
don't
know
whether
there's
a
divergence
between
principal
place
of
business
and...
and
main
office,
which
is
what
the
comptroller,
i
think,
considers
the
equivalent
of
the
place
of
incorporation.
it
is
possible.
but
remember,
at
the
time
all
of
these
statutes
were
enacted,
there
would
have
been
complete
parity
because
principal
place
of
business
was
not--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--a
corporation
was
not
a
citizen
of...
of
its
principal
place
of
business,
only
of
its
state
of
incorporation.
so
there
would
have
been
total
parity
in
1882,
1887,
1911,
1948.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
not
necessarily.
you
could
interpret
located
to
include
principal
place
of
business.
this
issue
doesn't
arise
in
this
case
because
what...
what
you
have
to
decide
is
whether
the
fact
that
the
bank
has
a
branch
in
south
carolina
means
they're
located
in
south
carolina.
south
carolina
is
not
wachovia's
principal
place
of
business
or--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--our...
our
view
is
that
it's
the
main
office.
i
would
defer
somewhat
to
my
colleague
from
the
government
who
can
speak
for
the
comptroller
on
this
question,
but
our
view
would
be
that
it's
the
main
office.
and...
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
when
we're
interpreting
these
statutes,
at
every
time
when
one
of
these...
when
the
statute
was
reenacted,
there
would
have
been
total
parity
between
our
definition
of
located.
there
would
have
been
one
place
for
a
national
bank.
there
would
have
been
one
citizenship
for
a
state
bank.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
possible
that
there
would
be
for
some
banks,
but
the
main
office
is
the
place
that...
that
the
comptroller
that...
that
is
in
their
articles
of
association,
which
can
be
amended
to
change
the
main
office,
and
it's
approved
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
and...
and
they
can
move
their
main
office.
whether
it...
all...
i
know
that
in
the
case
of
wachovia,
there
is
no
divergence.
north
carolina
is
its
main
office
and
is
its
principal
place
of
business.
but
i
can't
speak
for
everything.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
word
established
means.
that
would
be
different.
as
the
court
said
in
bougas,
it
wasn't
going
there,
and
i
don't
know
that
we
need
to
go
there
today.
established--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
established
could,
i
suppose,
mean
the
place
of
the
original
charter
location,
and
located
could
mean
the
place
where...
where
the
main
office
is
today.
they
could
mean
different
things.
remember
that
at
every...
at
every
enactment
of
this
statute,
there
was
no
difference
between
established
and
located.
the
terms
had
no
different
applications
because
a
national
bank
had
only
one
location,
which
was
the
place
where
it
was
established.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
there
was
total
parity
with
state
banks
because
up
until
1958
a
corporation
was
a
citizen
only
of
the...
the
place
of
incorporation,
and
there
was
total
parity
with
national
banks
because
they
were...
they
were
confined
to
their
original
state.
they
could
not
branch
outside
their
state
until
1994.
so
we're
interpreting
statutes
that
were
passed
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
parity
and
at
a
time
when
they
succeeded
in
achieving
parity.
and...
and
the
chief
justice's
question
and...
and
your
question
suggest
that
today,
with
the
changes
in
the
map
of
interstate
banking,
you
might
have
some
small
lack
of
total
overlap
between
state
banks
or
other
corporations,
on
the
one
hand,
and
national
banks.
but
that
is
not
a
reason
to
say
that
national
banks
are
citizens
of
every
place
where
they
have
any
physical
presence.
and
one
of
the
problems
with
the
fourth
circuit's
reading
is
that
it
injects
substantial
ambiguity
into
the
question
of
where
a
bank
is
located.
it's...
the
fourth
circuit
said
branches,
but
what
about
where
it
has
an
office
that's
not
a
branch?
what
about
where
it
stores...
where
it
has
warehouses
that
store
its
records?
what
about
where
it
has
employees?
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
what
about
where
it
has
an
atm.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't...
i
don't
recall.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
recall
that.
i
don't
recall
that,
but
i
think
the...
i
think
the
question
is
not
at
all
clear
where...
where
a
bank
would
be
located
if
it's
in
a
state
where
it
has
facilities,
property,
or
employees
but
not
a
branch.
and
as
you
said
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
sisson
against
ruby,
it's
not
a
good
idea
to
have
a
jurisdictional
statute...
reading
of
a
jurisdictional
statute
that
creates
ambiguities.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
depends
on
how
it
does
business.
a
state
bank
is
a
corporation
and
it
is--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
same
as
any
corporation.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
same
as
any
corporation.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
so
in
1958,
under...
if...
if
you
follow
the
chief
justice's
question,
in
1958
when
it
became
possible
for
corporations
to
be
citizens
of
more
than
one
state,
maybe
the
meaning
of
this
statute
that
was
passed
in
1948
changed.
i...
i
don't
think
that
makes
sense.
we're...
we're
trying
to
interpret
a
statute
that
congress
passed
in
1948.
at
that
time,
there
was
complete
parity.
the
fact
that
in
1958
congress
perceived
a
problem
which
is
not
a
problem
with
national
banks,
where
there
was
a
divergence,
a
serious
divergence,
between
the
place
of
incorporation
and
the
principal
place
of
business
that
congress
saw
we've
got
to
deal
with
this
problem.
and
so
they
amended
section
1332
in
1958
to
deal
with
that
particular
problem.
that
is
not
a
problem
that
affects
national
banks.
so
there's
been
no
occasion.
when
they
enacted
riegle
neal,
there
was
no...
no
need
for
them
to
change--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
true.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me...
let's...
let's
go
back
and...
because
justice
o'connor
started
me
off,
and
i...
i
don't
want
to
fail
to
get
to
her
question.
the
first
statute
was
the
1882
statute.
the
1882
statute
unambiguously
stated
that
the
jurisdiction
shall
be
the
same
as
and
not
other
than
the
jurisdiction
for
suits
by
or
against
banks
not
organized
under
any
law
of
the
united
states.
so
the...
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to...
to
give
national
banks
access
to
diversity
jurisdiction
on
the
same
basis
as
state
banks.
and
that...
in
the
leather
manufacturers
bank
case,
that
was
recognized
by
the
court.
then
in
1887,
congress
went
to
a
different
wording
totally.
it
injected
the
word
location.
and
i...
i
should
point
out
that
the
1882
statute
was
in
the
bank
act
and
the
1887
statute
was
in
the
judiciary
act.
so
it
was...
it's
not
clear
what
they
thought
they
were
doing
with
the
1882
statute
when
they
adopted
the
1887
statute.
but
it
is
clear
what
this
court
said
they
were
doing
in
the
petri
case.
this
court
said
no
reason
is
perceived
why
it
should
be
held
that
congress
intended
that
national
banks
should
not
resort
to
federal
tribunals
as
other
corporations
and
individual
citizens
might.
it
then
said
further
on,
on
page
651
of
142
u.s.,
the
clause
was
intended
to
have
and
must
receive
the
same
effect
and
operation
as
that
of
the
proviso
to
the
fourth
section
of
the
act
of
july
12,
1882.
and
finally,
they
close
by
saying,
no
limitations
in
the
regard
of
access
to
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
was
intended.
then
we
have
the
1911
codification,
and
in...
and
after
1911,
we
have
several
supreme
court
cases,
including
the
mitchell
case,
which
again
says
that
the
codification
worked
no
change.
it
says,
the
court
held
that
as
pursuits
with...
within
the
specified
exceptions,
national
banks
were,
by
the
acts
of
1882
and
1887,
put
on
the
same
basis
in
respect
of
jurisdiction
as
if
they
had
not
been
organized
under
an
act
of
congress.
and
then
in
1948,
you
have
the
reenactment
or
the
codification
of
the
current
judicial
code,
not
intended
to
work
any
change
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
think
it's
so
difficult
to--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
disregard
it.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
didn't
say
that
established
meant
something
different.
it
said
it
would
not
consider
what
established
meant.
and
in
deciding
what
located
meant,
it
didn't
say
located
had
some
obvious
meaning.
it
said
it
was
going
to
look
at
the
purpose,
and
the
purpose
was
the
convenience
of
the
bank.
and
what...
what
the
court
did
in
bougas
was
to
place
national
banks
in
a
position
of
parity
with
state
banks
with
regard
to
venue.
state
banks
could
be
sued
anyplace
they
had
a
branch,
and
under
bougas,
national
banks
could
be
sued.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
is
destroy--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--entirely
different
things
and
entirely
different
concerns.
and
i
don't
think...
well,
i'd
like
to
think
that
most
lawyers
would
go
beyond
the
logic
that
your
honor
has
suggested,
would
look
at
what
the
supreme
court
had
said
in
its
cases
interpreting
section
1348
and
its
predecessors,
and
would
look
at
the
mode
of
analysis
that
the
supreme
court
used
in
bougas,
and
applying
that
mode
of
analysis,
the
fourth
circuit
result
is
wrong.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
i'll
try
to
speak
quickly.
i
just
have
a
couple
of
points.
one
is
with
regard
to
the
spread
of
national
banks.
there
is
a
comparable
spread
of
state
banks.
for
instance,
sun
trust
is
a
bank
that's
comparable
in
scope
to
wachovia.
it
has
operations
in
many
states.
it
has
many
branches,
i
assume,
in
south
carolina.
and
yet,
it
is
a
citizen
only
of
its
home
state,
its
state
of
incorporation,
or
principal
place
of
business.
if
there
were
a
problem
of
abuse
of
relocation,
which
i
think
the
court
was
a
little
bit
worried
about,
congress
would
deal
with
it
the
way
they
dealt
with
the
abuses
of
corporate...
stated
place
of
incorporation
by
passing
1332(c).
so
let
me--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
could
have,
but
it
saw
no
need.
there
was
a
statute
that
had
been
consistently
on
the
books
for
a
century
that
meant
the
same
thing,
which
is
surely
what
congress
wanted.
why
would
congress
bother
when
it
enacted
riegle
neal
and
allowed
interstate
branching,
to
say,
by
the
way,
just
like
state
corporations
which
conduct
business
in
many
states,
you
know,
the
rule
that
we...
we've
adopted
that
banks
are
located
in
their
main
office
or
their
charter
location,
still
applies?
that
would--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
court.
it's...
it's
been...
you
have
a
series
of
statutes,
and
each
time
the
court
says
it
doesn't
change
from
the
original
1882
meaning.
you
have
the
1882
statute
and
you
have
1887,
and
the
court
says
this
means
the
same
thing
as
1882.
then
you
have
1911.
the
court
says
this
means
the
same
thing
as
1911.
then
1948.
i
think
langdeau
says
it
means
the
same
thing
there.
let
me
just,
in
the
brief
time
i
have
left,
on
in
pari
materia,
which
is
at
the
heart
of
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
bougas
case.
let
me
just
cite
two
cases
to
the
court
that
i
think
are
instructive
on
this,
united
states
against
granderson,
511
u.s.
39,
and
fort
stewart
schools,
495
u.s.
641,
both
refusing
to
apply
the
in
pari
materia
doctrine
where
you
had
quite
comparable
statutes.
thank
you.
