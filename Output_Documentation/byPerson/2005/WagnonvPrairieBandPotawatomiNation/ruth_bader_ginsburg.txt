or
gets
it
back,

it

to

or

in

justice

and
out
of
state
or
abroad--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
that...
that
has
been
what's
discussed
in
the
brief,
and
i
think
that
the
court,
in
chickasaw,
was
saying,
if
the
state
puts
the
incidence
on
the
tribe
itself,
we
don't
have
to
look
any
further.
that's
what
it
said.
when
the
state
levies
a
tax
directly
on
the
tribe
or
members
inside
the
reservation,
no
balancing.
but
then
it
also
said
that
if
the
incidence
rests
on
non
indians,
as
here,
with
the
distributor
here,
then
there
is
no
categorical
bar,
than
balancing
kicks
in.
so,
all
chickasaw
dealt
with,
with
the
categorical
rule,
is
when
the
state
says
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
tribe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
in
terms
of
the
text
of
the
statute
that
is...
the
incidence
is
on
the
distributor
of
the
first
receipt,
but
then
there's
this
language...
and
it
appears
in
a
few
places...
"the
tax
is
hereby
imposed
on
the
use,
sale,
or
delivery.
"
what
does...
what
does
that
mean,
that
"the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
use,
sale,
or
delivery?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--could
we
go
back--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
the
question
that
justice
souter
raised
at
the
outset?
because
i'm
really
puzzled.
this
is
the
picture
i
have
of
the
case.
and
please
tell
me
where
it's
wrong.
two
jurisdictions,
both
with
authority
to
impose
a
tax,
the
state
and
the
tribe.
so,
if
the
other
weren't
taxing,
there
wouldn't
be
any
question,
that
the
tribe
can
tax
and
the
state
can
tax.
but
the
two
can't
coexist,
because
the
consumer's
not
going
to
pay
the
price.
so,
only
one
can.
and
the
issue
is,
which
one
dominates,
and
which
is
one
is
subordinate?
but
you
have
unquestionable
authority
to
tax
in
both.
and
i
thought
it
was
clear
that
the
two
taxes
did...
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
tribe
can
impose
a
tax,
the
state
can
im...
oppose.
i
read
the
briefs
to
accept
that
the
tribe
tax...
couldn't
put
its
tax
on
top
of
the
state
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
tax
free.
i
mean,
the...
a
big
thing
that
was
made
in
this
case
was
that,
unlike
the
cigarette
sales
in
the
smoke
shops,
the
tribe
is
not
trying
to
market
a
tax
exemption.
it
is
putting
on
its
own
tax,
which
will
cost
the
customer,
in
the
end,
the
same
as
if
there
had
been
a
state
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
chickasaw
said
when
the
tax
was
imposed
on
the
tribe,
we
would
take
the
state
at
its
word.
it
said
it's
taxing
the
tribe.
if
the
state
put
the
tax
on
a
nonindian,
then
there
would
be
balancing.
and
that's
what
chickasaw--
