well,
but
aren't
they
going
to
tell
us
that...
as
a
practical
matter,
that
the
tax
is
really
being
collected
for
the
retailers?
it's
just
being
passed
on
to
the
retailers,
but
paid
by
the...
i
take
it
that
the
distributor...
the
way
this
works...
i,
again,
had
problems
with
effect...
i
take
it
the
distributor
sends
out
a
truck.
and
if
he
sends
out
the
truck
to
the
tribe,
then
the
distributor
just
pays
the
tax,
and
the
tribe
would
want
that
tax
to
be...
that
fuel
to
be
distributed,
less
the
cost
of
the
tax.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
the
tribe
view
prevails,
then
the
distributor
still
sends
the
truck
to
the
stations
that
are
in
the
state
and
passes
on
the
tax
for
those--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--distributors
only.
i
take
it
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
we
can--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
we
can
decide
it
on
the
basis
that
we
know
that
when
the
distributor
puts...
delivers
gas
to
the
gas
station,
it's
not
instantly
sold.
i
mean,
even
we
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
relevant--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
the
balancing
test--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
should
all
of
that
make
a
difference?
you
make
a
big
point
in
the
briefing,
"well,
you're
not
marketing
the
exemption,
you're
taxing,
you're
using.
"
--if
the...
if
the
tribe
does
have
the
sovereign
right
to
tax
or
not
to
tax,
why
can't
it
use
it
not
to
tax
at
all
and
say,
"we're
giving"...
why
is
there
a
presumption
in
favor
of
imposing
taxes?
why
can't
the
tribe
say,
"we're
not
going
to
tax
you
if
you
come
to
the
reservation.
"
"come
on
in
and
buy
our
gas.
"
"no
tax?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't...
why
isn't
that
part
of
the
tribal
sovereign
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
just
don't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--understand.
why
doesn't
the
tribe
have
an
incidence
of
not
having
any
tax
at
all,
helping--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--helping
its
members?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
does
the
balancing
only
work
if
it
taxes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
no.
you
say
that
it
could--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--market
the
exemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
that
a
tribe
can
market
its
exemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
that
sovereign
interest
in
not
taxing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
supreme
court's
characterization
of
this
as
being--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
