mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
the
tribe's
view,
the
state's
defense
of
its
tax
today
depends
on
a
tax
that
does
not
exist.
two
distinct
sovereigns
have
imposed
fuel
taxes
here.
the
prairie
band
potawatomi
nation
has
imposed
a
tribal
tax
on
a
tribal
station
operating
on
tribal
trust
land.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
it
is,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--the
record
is
clear
that
the
two
taxes
cannot
coexist
in
the
long
run,
because
it
would
price
the--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--price
the--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
the
tribe
is
being
forced
right
now
to
subsidize
the
sales
at
the
station
at
a
loss,
which
it's
doing
for
the
balance
of
this
litigation.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
but
the--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
the
tribe...
the
tribe
is--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
that's
correct,
at
the
moment--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
because
the
tribe
should
not
be
put
to
the
choice,
as
a
sovereign,
where
it's
running
a
tribal
business,
of
choosing
between...
of
generating
revenues
by
the
tax
versus
generating
revenues
by
the
profit.
there
is
no--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--suggestion,
your
honor--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
i
think,
in
that
situation,
that
the
two
are
very
similar,
in
the
same
way
when
a
state
sells
at
a
state
liquor
store--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--because,
your
honor,
the...
it
is
exactly
the
tribal
taxing
authority
that
interfered.
it's
a...
it's
quite
a
strange
form
of
taxing
authority
that
says
you
can
tax
the...
you
can
tax
the
station,
but
then...
but
then
essentially
have
to
operate
the
station
at
a
loss.
that's
not--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--that
is
not
a--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--that
is
not
a--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--because
that
does
not
describe
the
tax
that's
at
issue
here.
the
tax
at
issue
here
is
imposed
on
the
sale
or
delivery
of
fuel
to
the
tribe
on
the
reservation,
and
that
is
plain--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--and--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--and
that,
your
honor,
is
not
correct.
what
they
have
done
is
conflate
two
concepts,
the
incidence
of
the
tax--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--and
the--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--i...
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says,
in
3408,
"a
tax
per
gallon
is
hereby
imposed
on
the
use,
sale,
or
delivery
of
fuel.
"
it
does
not
say
"the
receipt
of
fuel".
"the
distributor"
is
defined
as
somebody
who
receives
and
uses,
sells,
or
delivers
fuel.
all
of
the
critical
exemptions
in
the
statutes
are
based
on
the
distributor's
subsequent
sale
or
delivery
of
fuel
to
the
united
states,
out
of
state,
the
federal
contract--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
this
would
be
a
very
different
case
if
the
state
had...
if
the
legislature
had
passed
a
tax
that
said,
"this
is
a
tax
on
receipt.
"
and
we
were
trying
to
argue
that
these...
that
somehow
these
exemptions
made
it
not
a
tax
on
receipt.
but
the
legislature
has
said
it
is
a
tax
on
the
"use,
sale,
or
delivery.
"
and
if
i
could
point
to
two
provisions
that
i
think
make
this
crystal
clear,
that
it
is
not
a
tax
on
receipt,
but
on
the
subsequent
use,
sale,
or
delivery.
the
first
is
3417,
which
provides--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--and
that
is--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--at
10(a)
in
the
appendix
your
honor,
that
provides
that
a
distributor
after
he
has
received
the
fuel,
if
he
subsequently
loses
the
fuel...
has
it
lost
or
burned...
gets
a
refund
of
the
tax,
if
it's...
if
that
happens
before
he
uses,
sells,
or
delivers.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
the
other
thing
that--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
there
are...
there
is
literally
nothing
in
the
statute
except
for
the
incidence
provision,
which
is
what
the
state
relies
on,
that
makes
this
a
tax
on
receipt.
and,
if
i
could,
in
central--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
i
don't...
i
think
that
you're...
that
he
would
pay
the
tax
in
that
instance--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--but
i
don't
think--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--i
don't
think
so--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
because...
two
reasons,
your
honor...
in
the
real
world,
what
happens
is
the
distributor
picks
up
the
fuel
at
the
rack
and
delivers
it
to
the
retailer.
if
the...
if
the
distributor
takes
the
fuel
and
holds
it,
he's
not
a
distributor
under
the
statute.
a
distributor
is
somebody
who
receives
and
uses,
sells,
or
delivers.
that's
in...
on
page
2(a)
of
the
red
brief,
your
honor.
so
that--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--i--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
that
happening.
but
what
i
would
say...
the
point
that
i
would
like
to--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
can
decide
this
question
based
on
what
the
face
of
the
statute
is...
itself
says.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
no
court--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--no,
your
honor...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
statute
provides
that
the
tax
is
on
the
sale
by
the
distributor
to
the
tribe
on
its
reservation.
it
is
exactly
like
what
happened
in
central
machinery.
in
central
machinery,
the
incidence
of
the
tax
was
indisputably
on
the
off
reservation
seller.
this
court,
nevertheless,
said,
correctly,
that
the
taxable
event,
the
thing
that
was
being
taxed,
was
the
sale
of
tractors
to
the
tribe
on
the
reservation--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--that
was,
therefore,
preempted.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
with
respect,
your
honor,
what
part
(c)
says,
which
is
what
you're
reading
from,
it
says,
"the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
distributor
of
first
receipt.
"
that
is
the
"who".
that
is
not
the
"what".
the
79-3408(a),
and
it
is
clearly
imposed
on
the
use,
sale,
or
delivery
of
the
fuel.
if
i
could,
another
provision
of
the
statute
that
also--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--that's
right,
your
honor.
but
the
question
is,
what
exactly
is
the
state
purporting
to
tax?
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
state
is
not
being
unambiguous...
is
being
unambiguous
about
what
it's
taxing.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
your
honor,
i
think
the
term
"use"
is
the
distributor's
use.
the
scheme
that
kansas
has
set
up
is
a
sensible
one.
it
is,
the
distributor
gets
the
tax
and
then
has
three
choices.
it
can
use
it,
sell
it,
or
deliver
it.
and
if
the
distributor...
if
the
distributor
is...
hasn't
done
one
of
those
things,
then
it's...
then
it...
then
the
distributor
can
be
made
liable
for
any
tax
increases
that
have...
that
happen
while
the
distributor
is
holding
the
tax.
and
so,
in
our
view,
and
in
every
court
that
we're
aware
of's
view...
tenth
circuit
didn't
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
a
tax
on
receipt
of
fuel
off
the
reservation.
what
the
tenth
circuit
said
was
that
kansas
is
now
attempting
to
collect
its
tax
for
the
first
time,
a
tax
on
motor
fuel
distributed
to
indian
lands.
it
is,
again,
the
same
thing--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--that's
right.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
yes.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
your
honor,
the
answer
is--
that's
correct,
and
that's
exactly
what
happens
in
the
commerce
clause
when
a
person
from
virginia
buys
something
from
illinois
and
has
it
delivered
to
himself
in
virginia.
they
don't
pay
the
sales
tax.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
no,
your
honor,
under
interstate
sales
tax.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
it's
the
same
situation--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--i'm
sorry.
it
was...
it's
the
same
situation
there.
the
question
is,
where
does
the
relevant
sale
take
place?
and
it
takes
place...
in
the
virginia/illinois
situation,
the
sale
takes
place
in
virginia,
which
is
why
you
don't
pay
illinois
sales
tax,
though
you
may
pay
virginia
use
tax.
it
would
be
the
same
thing
in
the
tribal
situation.
the
sale
in
that
place,
just
like
the
sale
in
central
machinery,
takes
place
on
the
reservation.
and
what
this
court
said,
in
central
machinery,
is
that
a
sale
to
a
tribe
of
goods
on
the
reservation
is...
cannot
be
taxed
by
the
state.
and,
indeed,
because
this
tax
is
on
the
sale
on
the
reservation,
the
broader
balancing
principles
apply.
the
tribe
here
has
imposed
the...
its
tax
on
a
tribal
station,
on
a
tribal
land,
right
where
this
court
has
said
its
tribal
taxing
authority
is
strongest,
and
has
dedicated
those
revenues
to
improving
the
miles
of
dirt
and
gravel
road
on
the
reservation.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
it...
that
way
it
works,
in
practice,
your
honor,
is...
and
their
form
is
in
the
back
of
the
red
brief...
is
that
the
distributor
writes
down
the
number
of
gallons
received,
and
writes
down
the
number
of
gallons
sold
to
the
united
states,
nets
that
out,
and
pays
the
tax
on
the
net,
so
that
it's...
it's
essentially
done
at
the...
at
the
same
time.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
i'm
not
sure
his
obligation
to
do
so,
but
the
form
is
due
on
the
25th
of
the
month...
of
the
next
month.
and
so--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--correct,
your
honor.
it
shows
gallons
received,
gallons
exported,
gallons
sold
to
the
united
states.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
but
no,
under
their
theory
of
the
case.
the
exemption
to
the
united
states--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--is
constitutionally--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
well,
it
depends,
your
honor,
on
whether
the
legal
incidence
is
on
the
united
states
or
whether
the
incidence
is
on
the
seller.
under
this--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--court's
precedence--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--because,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
what
this
court's
cases
say.
i
think
what
this
court's--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--cases
say--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--i
think--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--that's
my
understanding,
as
well.
and
this
court
has
always
held
it's
a
federal
question
where
legal
incidence
lies,
and
has
not
deferred...
has
given--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--but
if
i--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor?
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
that
the...
your
honor,
we
disagree
with
that
at
every
level.
this...
the
tribal
tax
is
addressed
to
a
specific
road...
road
problem
that
the
federal
government
has
identified
and
addressed
in
the
reservation
road
program.
the
reservation
roads
are
in
abysmal
shape,
as
the
federal
government
has
recognized.
more
than
70
percent
are
in
poor
shape,
poor
condition.
the
fatality
rate
is
four
times
the
national
average.
and
the
tribe
is
using
those
revenues
to
fix...
advance
that
particular
federal
interest,
which
is
reflected
in
federal
statutes
and
in
the
federal
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
this--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--because
this
court
has
held,
in
colville...
and
we
don't
dispute
here...
that
when
the
tribe
is
marketing
an
exemption,
it
has
no...
it
has
no...
there
are
no
federal
and
tribal
interests
implicated.
and
we're
not
challenging
that
here.
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
when
a
tribe
is
generating
real
value
on
the
reservation
so
that
it
has
created
a
market,
as
this
tribe
has,
to
draw
people
onto
the
reservation
and
can
sell
its
fuel
at
market
value,
it
has
a
sovereign
right
and
interest
in
taxing
that...
in
imposing
a
tax
that
the
state
can't
interfere
with.
and
the
state
here
has
accommodated--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--no,
it
taxes--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--the
retailer.
it
taxes
the
retailer,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
it
is.
it
taxes
the
tribal
station.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
it
is,
your
honor,
but
that
tax
is--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
actually,
it
happens
all
the
time.
pennsylvania
imposes
a
tax
on
state
sold
liquor.
north
carolina
does
it.
all
the
state
run
liquor
stores
are
subject
to
a
state
imposed
tax.
but--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--your
honor,
at
that
point,
central
machinery
wouldn't
apply.
i
think
that
would
be
a
closer
case
for
the
balancing,
in
that
situation.
the...
so,
we
wouldn't...
we
wouldn't
concede
that.
but,
in
this
case,
it's
much
stronger,
because
the
tax
is
on
the
reservation.
if
i
could
also
just
point
to
one
thing
that
justice
breyer
raised
about
the...
about
the
exemptions
for
other
states.
what
this...
what
kansas
has
done
is
provide
an
exemption
for
every
other
sovereign
that's
implicated...
for
other
states,
for
other
countries,
for--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--the
united
states--
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
--it's...
it
is,
your
honor,
in
this
sense.
it
comes
in,
in
two
situations.
first,
it
is...
the
constitution
and
the
federal
preemption
doctrine
prohibit
discrimination.
and
so,
it
is,
in
that
sense.
but
it
also
goes
to
the
strength
of
the
state
interest
here.
the
state
has
not
only...
has
accommodated
the
out
of
state
interest,
it
has
also
accommodated
the
in
state
government
interests,
other
than
the
tribe.
it
gives
30
to
40
percent
of
the
fuel
revenues
to
counties
and
to
cities
for
roads.
every
other
sovereign
is
accommodated
here
except
for
the
tribe,
and
we
think
that's
exactly
what
federal
law
prohibits
and
why
the
strength
of
the
tribal
interest
here,
and
the
tribe's
interest
in
imposing
the
tax
to
fix
reservation
roads,
to
advance
that
federal
interest,
is
exactly
what
deserves
protection.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
disappear,
but
it
might
alter
the...
it
would
alter
the
balance.
if
the...
what
is
troubling
here
is
that
the
state
has
asserted
a
right
in
predictability,
but
the
state's
right
in
predictability
is
only
coming
at
the
expense
of
a
refusal
to
accommodate
the
tribal
interests
in
the
same
way
it
accommodates
every
other
sovereign.
and
so,
we
do
think
that
that
goes
to
the
strength
of
the
state's
interest
here,
and
to
the
state...
the
strength
of
the...
of
the
state's
assertion
of
its
tax.
mr.
ian
heath
gershengorn
i
think
it--
mr.
