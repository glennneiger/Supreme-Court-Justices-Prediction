make
it
up
on
volume,
i
think.
justice

or
want
to
impose
a
higher
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
want
to
impose
a
higher
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
a
strange
provision.
i
mean,
who
would
have
thought
that
he
couldn't?
why
did--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
ever
put
that
provision
in,
unless
it
means
something
different
from--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
olson,
you
mentioned
section
3410.
where
does
that
appear
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
can't
find
it
in
anybody's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
is
it
taxing?
is
it
taxing
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
tribe
sells
the
gas--
justice
antonin
scalia
--doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if...
what...
perhaps
the
state
expresses
it
that
way
just
to
cover
some
people
who
get
their
gas
illegally,
and
they
would
say
the
tax
is
still
due,
even
if
you
haven't
gotten
your
gas
from
a
distributor
who
has
paid
the
state
tax.
wouldn't
that
suffice
for
why
the
court
imposes
the
tax
on
the
use,
sale,
or
delivery?
use,
sale,
or
delivery.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
is...
who
is
the
tribe
taxing?
is
the
tribe
taxing
the
purchaser
of
the
gas?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
the
retailer
was
the
tribe.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it's
taxing
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
real
neat.
i
have
never
heard
of
that
before.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
cities
and
counties--
justice
antonin
scalia
--aren't
sovereign.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
other
sovereigns
you
mentioned
do
not
consume
the
gas...
or
the
gas
sold
to
them
is
not
consumed
primarily
on
the
roads
of
this
state,
except
for
cities
and
counties,
which
aren't
sovereigns.
i
mean,
they
simply
aren't
sovereign.
that's
the
state,
itself.
they're
subdivisions
of
the
state.
so,
it's
making
exemptions
for
its
own...
its
own
state,
plus
exemptions
for
sovereigns,
where
the
gas
sold
to
those
sovereigns
probably
will
not
be
used
primarily
on
the
roads
of
this
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
perfect
sense.
i
don't
see
there's
any
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
that's
because
when
a
distributor
sells
to
another
distributor,
he
is
not
acting,
for
purposes
of
that
sale,
as
a
distributor.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
sell
to
another
distributor,
you're
not
being--
justice
antonin
scalia
aren't
there
usually
two
incidents?
you
talk
about
the
incident
of
the
taxes
on
a
person,
but
it's
also
on
an
event.
and
what
event
is...
in
your...
in
your
judgment
is--
