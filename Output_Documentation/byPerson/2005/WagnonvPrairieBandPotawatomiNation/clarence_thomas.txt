justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
10th
circuit.
petitioner,
the
state
of
kansas,
imposes
a
tax
on
the
receipt
of
motor
fuel
by
distributors
within
its
boundaries.
kansas
supplies
that
tax
to
motor
fuel
received
by
non-indian
fuel
distributors,
who
subsequently
deliver
that
fuel
to
a
gas
station
owned
by,
and
located
on,
the
reservation
of
petitioner,
the
prairie
band
potawatomi
nation.
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
this
application
of
the
kansas
motor-fuel
tax
was
an
impermissible
affront
to
petitionerâ€™s
sovereignty
and
held
that
the
tax
was
invalid
under
the
interest-balancing
tests
that
we
set
forth
in
white
mountain
apache
tribe
versus
bracker.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under
our
indian
tax-immunity
cases,
the
who
and
the
where
of
the
challenged
tax
have
significant
consequences.
we
have
determined
that
the
states
are
categorically
banned,
barred,
from
placing
the
legal
incidence
of
an
excise
tax
on
a
tribe
or
on
the
tribal
members
for
sale
made
on
reservation.
we
have
further
determined
that
even
when
a
state
imposes
the
legal
incidence
of
its
tax
on
a
non-indian
seller,
the
tax
is
subject
to
an
interest-balancing
test
if
the
transaction
giving
rise
to
tax
liability
occurs
on
reservation.
but
this
case
presents
neither
scenario.
here,
kansas
places
a
legal
incidence
of
its
motor-fuel
tax
on
the
distributor
who
first
receives
motor
fuel.
as
such,
the
tax
is
imposed
on
a
non-indian,
and
it
arises
as
a
result
of
an
off-reservation
transaction.
we
have
never
suggested
that
such
a
tax
is
subject
to
interest
balancing,
and
we
decline
to
do
so
today.
consistent
with
our
cases
holding
that
indians
venturing
off
the
reservation
are
subject
to
nondiscriminatory
state
taxes,
we
hold
that
a
state
excise
tax
imposed
on
a
non-indian
that
arises
as
a
result
of
an
off-reservation
transaction
is
not
subject
to
interest
balancing
and
that
the
kansas
motor-fuel
tax
is
valid.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
kennedy
joins.
