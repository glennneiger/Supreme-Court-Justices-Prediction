chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
wagnon
vs.
prairie
band
potawatomi
nation.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
mr.
olson,
the
solicitor
general
tells
us
that...
and
here
we
have...
you
have
the
statute,
but
they
have
the
kaul
case
that
suggests
that
this
tax
is
imposed
on
the
reservation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
olson,
what
does
it
mean
when
they
say,
in
law,
the
"incidence
of
the
taxes
on
the
distributor?
"
does
that
mean
anything
other
than
that
he
has
to
pay
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
the
reason
for
my
question
is,
they
look
back
at
the
court's
decisions
and
see
that
it
turns
on
where
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is.
and
so,
there's
some
bright
lawyer
in
kansas
who
said,
"all
we
have
to
do
is
pass
a
law
saying
the
incidence
is...
of
the
tax
is
on
the
distributor,
and
we're
going
to
win.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
it
suggests
that
we
shouldn't
give
too
much
weight
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
gershengorn.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
just
a
subsequent
deduction.
i
mean,
if
we
get
income,
we're
taxed
on
it.
if
we
make
a
charitable
contribution,
we
get
a
deduction.
but
that
doesn't
mean
we
don't
have
to
pay
and
are
subject
to
the
income
tax.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--where
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--works
with
the
income
tax,
too.
you
have
casualty
losses
and
things
like
that.
it
turns
out
you
were
subject
to
the
tax,
but
you
don't
have
to
pay
it,
because
you
get
a
deduction.
but
that
doesn't
mean
you're
not
subject
to
it
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
statute
says--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
statute
says
it's
a
tax
on
the
sale,
but
then
it
goes
on
and
says
it's
the
first
sale,
and
the
first
sale
is
to
the
distributor,
and
that's
why
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
him.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
nobody...
but
it's
not
sold...
it's
not
taxed
twice.
if
it's
sold
to
a
distributor,
that
distributor
has
to
pay
the
tax.
the
distributor
then
sells
it
to
someone
else.
that
someone
else
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
tax.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
did
i
understand
your
earlier
discussion,
about
the
department
store,
to
suggest
that
if
the
tribe
had
the
tanker
truck,
and
they
picked
up
the
fuel
and
then
brought
it
back,
that,
in
that
case,
you
have
no
objection
to
the
tax,
even
though
the
economic
incidence
and
effect
is
going
to
be
the
same?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
it
the
sale
between
whoever
is
selling
it
to
the
distributor
and
the
distributor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
none
of
this...
none
of
this
mattered
to
the
tenth
circuit,
though,
did
it?
i
mean,
they
didn't
care
where
the
incidence
was.
they
just
went
right
into
the
balancing,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
think
that
was
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
olson,
you
have
four
and
a
half
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
in
wagnon
versus
prairie
band
of
potawatomi
nation.
