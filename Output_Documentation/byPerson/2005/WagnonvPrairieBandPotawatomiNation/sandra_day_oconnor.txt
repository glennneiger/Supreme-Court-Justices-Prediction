well,
what
event
triggers,
if
you
will,
the
incidence
of
the
tax
on
the
distributor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it...
is
it
the
obligation...
is
it
the
minute
the
fuel
is
brought
into
kansas?
is
it
when
it
is
delivered
to
the
distributor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
is
it
later?
justice

so,
the
distributor
gets
the
fuel
and
incurs
the
obligation
at
that
point,
whether
or
not
it's
resold.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
it...
but
they
say
no,
that
it's
imposed
on
the
delivery
to
the
distributor--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
fuel.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
what
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--statute
says.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
on
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax,
we
suggested,
in
the
chickasaw
nation
case,
that
a
tax
statute's
own
declaration
of
the
legal
incidence
would
be
dispositive.
so,
why
don't
we
read
the
statute
and
say
the
incidence
is
on
the
distributor,
and
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
that's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
we
suggested
in
chickasaw
nation.
