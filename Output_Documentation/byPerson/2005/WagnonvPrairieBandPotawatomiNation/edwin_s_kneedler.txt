mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
tribe
here
has
imposed
a
tribal
tax
on
sales
at
a
tribal
business
on
the
tribe's
own
reservation
on
tribal
land.
the
exercise
of
that
power
of
taxation
is
at
the
core
of
tribal
sovereignty,
as
this
court
has
long
recognized,
and
that
power--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
and,
as
to
that
question,
i
would
point
the
court
to
page
142
of
the
joint
appendix,
or
page
12
of
the
petition
appendix,
in
which
the
court
discusses
the
expert
opinion
that
the
tribe
introduced
into
the
record.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
he
says--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
it
is
operating
at
a
loss.
as
i
understand
it,
the
tribe
has
chosen
to
subsidize--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--out
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--revenues.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
my
understanding
of
what's
happening.
that's
not
in
the
record.
what
is
in
the
record--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think,
for
example,
in
this
court's
decision
in
colville,
where
the
court
stressed
there
that
the
court
was
marketing
an
exemption
from
state
taxation;
that
portion
of
the
analysis
of
the
court
there
did
not
turn
on
whether
the
tribe
was
imposing
its
own
tax.
it
turned--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
turned
on
economic--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
flip
side
of
that
in
colville
was
that
if
the...
if
the
tribe,
in
that
case,
had
been
selling
to
people
who
would
have
been
on
the
reservation
anyway...
in
other
words
had
not
come
onto
the
reservation
to
take...
just
to
take
advantage
of
an
exemption
from
state
taxation...
but
would
have
been
on
the
reservation
anyway,
the
court
specifically
contemplated,
in
that
situation,
that
the
tax
might
well
be
preempted,
because
it
would
be
interfering--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
we...
but
we
believe
it
is
a
winning
argument.
i
think
the
fair
reading
of
colville
is
that
the
court
would
have
seen
that
as
quite
different.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
this
is...
this
is
not
just
any
upstream
tax,
and
it...
and
the
theory
here
is
not
based
on
economic
impact.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
under
the...
first
of
all,
in
our...
it
is
our
position
that,
under
the
kansas
supreme
court's
decision
in
kaul,
which
should
get
deference
in
terms
of
understanding
operative
incidence
of
the
state
tax.
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is,
in
fact,
on
the
retailer.
and
the
court
there
found
it
critical--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
legal
incidence--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--was...
is
on
the
retail--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
we
read
the
kansas
supreme
court's
decision,
it's
not
without
ambiguity,
but
we
believe
the
better
reading
of
that...
of
that
decision
is
that,
as
a
matter
of
legislative
intent,
the
incidence
of
the
tax,
who
is
ultimately
going
to
pay
the
tax--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--is
on
the
retailer.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
would
tell...
that
would
tell
you...
i'm
sorry--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
they
do.
and,
again,
this
is
the
situation
contemplated
in
colville.
it's
analogous
to
what
this
court
said
in
cabazon
with
respect
to
the
gambling
facility,
where
the
tribe
has
introduced
on
reservation
value.
and
in
colville,
the
court
contemplated
if
the
tribe
puts
a
service
station
and
sells
to
people
who
would
be
there
anyway,
that
is
on
reservation
value;
they
are
not
simply
marketing
a
tax
exemption
and
drawing
people
in
by
virtue
of
a
tax
exemption.
but,
beyond
that,
just
because...
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
distributor,
notwithstanding
the
kansas
supreme
court's
decision,
the
subject
matter
of
the
tax,
the
"what
is
being
taxed",
is
the
sale
or
distribution,
and
that
is
a
sale
between
the
distributor
and
the
retailer.
that
is
clearly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
because
if
you
look
in...
it
becomes
particularly
clear
if
you
look
at
the
form
that
is
at
the
back
of
the
respondent's
brief,
but
we
also
believe
it's
clear
from
the...
from
the
provisions
of
the
statute
that
are
on
page
8(a)
of
the
brief.
one
that
hasn't
been
discussed,
for
example,
is
exemption
d5...
excuse
me...
the
exception
for
deliveries
to
other
distributors.
in
that...
in
that
situation,
there
is
no
tax.
and,
in
fact,
the
form,
on
page
19(a),
makes
it
clear
that
any
sales
by
one
distributor
to
another
are
automatically
exempted
and
not
counted
in
the
computation
at
all.
so,
distributor
to
distributor
taxes
are
exempted.
and
this
court,
in
the
chickasaw
case,
said
that's
very
instructive,
that
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
retailer.
whether
or
not
the
incidence
is
there,
the
transaction--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--only
one
distributor
has
to
pay,
but
it
means
that
a
sale
between
the
first
distributor
and
the
second
distributor,
for
example,
is
not
taxed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
actually,
there
is
not.
the
tax
is
on
the
last
distributor,
with
respect
to
his
sale
to
the...
to
the
retailer.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
makes...
that
makes
my
point,
that
the...
that
the
statute,
in
applying
to
any
use,
delivery,
or
sale,
the
sale
at
issue
is
the
sale
that
ultimately
comes
from
a
distributor
to
a
retailer.
and,
under
this
court's
decisions
in
central
arizona
machinery
and
the
bracker
case,
a
sale
by
a...
by
someone
residing
off
the
reservation,
but
where
the
sale
takes
place
on
the
reservation,
as
this
one
clearly
does...
the
gasoline
that's
delivered
there...
that
is
absolutely
preempted
under
central
arizona
machinery
and
the
indian
trader
statutes,
because
you--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
that's
true.
and
if--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
think
the
court
was
wrong
to
conclude
that
the
incidence
was
on
the...
was
on
the
distributor.
and
if
the
court
has
a
question
about
that,
it
could
remand
to
certify
that
question
to
the
kansas
supreme
court
to
clear
it
up,
any
ambiguity
after
kaul.
but,
even
on
the
tenth
circuit's
own
way
of
approaching
it,
we
believe
that
it
was
then
correct,
because
it
properly
applied
this
court's
approach
of
looking
at
the
particular
context
of
the
federal,
state,
and
tribal
interests.
and
here,
there
are
very
powerful
tribal
interests
in
maintaining--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
the
very
same--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
the
very
same
interest
that
the
state
is
asserting,
which
is
the
interest
to
impose
a
fuel
tax
in
order
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--maintain
the
roads--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--on
the
reservation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
is
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--is
the
general...
the
general
ability
to
impose
a
tax.
but
here,
the
interest
is
augmented
by
the
fact
that
the
tax
is
dedicated
by
tribal
law
to
maintaining
tribal
roads,
not
just
this
one
and
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--half
mile--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
don't
think
it
does.
under
the
colville's
decision,
if
the
state
is
not
just...
or
the
tribe
is
not
just
marketing
an
exemption
from
state
taxation,
we
think
that
the
tribe...
that
the
state
tax
is
preempted
there,
as
well.
but
here,
where
the
tribe
is
asserting
not
simply
a
commercial
interest,
selling
at
market
value
and
not
marketing
a
tax
exemption
of
states--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
imposing
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
we
do
not.
under
this...
under
this
court's
decision
in
colville,
it
can't...
the
tribe
cannot
market
an
exemption,
at
least
to
people
who
would
not
otherwise
be
on
the
reservation.
but
here,
the
tribe
is
asserting
both
a
commercial
interest...
selling
at
profit;
and
also
a
sovereign
interest...
in
taxing.
and
where
you
have
a
tribe
asserting
both--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
could.
but
here,
the
tribe
has
asserted
a
sovereign
interest
in
its
tax,
and
that
is
what
is
being
substantially
interfered
with.
