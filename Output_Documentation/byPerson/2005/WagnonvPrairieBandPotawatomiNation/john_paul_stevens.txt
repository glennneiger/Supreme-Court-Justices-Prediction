but,
mr.
olson,
would
it
make
any
difference
if
all
of
the
driving
was
inside
the
reservation?
would
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but,
again,
that
would
still
be
true
if
the
incidence...
the
tax
was
on
the
retailer
rather
than
the
wholesaler.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
the
statute
contemplates
will
be
collected
when
the
gas
is
sold
to
the...
by
the
retailer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean,
mr.
olson,
that
the
tax
that
the...
the
fuel,
rather,
that's
sold
to
the
united
states
government,
later,
out
of
state,
when
is
the
credit
for
the
sales
out
of
state
made?
is
that
made
at
the
time
of
the
initial
delivery,
or
is...
do
they
ask
for
a
refund
a
month
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
couldn't
tell
from
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
seems
to
me
that
might
be
a
way
of
identifying
whether
the
term
"legal
incidence"
really
has
any
significance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i,
sort
of,
take
"legal
incidence"
to
mean
the
duty
to
pay
the
tax.
and
i'm
just
wondering
whether...
when
fuel
is
sold
to
a
distributor
that
the...
i
mean,
the
distributor
knows
the
fuel
is
going
to
be
resold
to
the
united
states...
does
he
have
an
exemption
from
the
tax,
because
he
knows
what's
going
to
happen
to
it,
or
does
he
have
to
pay
the
tax,
or
accept
the
obligation
to
pay
the
tax,
and
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--subtract,
later
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
couldn't
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
what
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
federal
exemption?
in
your
view,
is
that
made
available
at
the
time
of
the
initial
purchase
by
the
distributor,
or
does
he
have
to,
in
effect,
claim
a
credit
later
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
he...
his
obligation
to
sell
the
gas
is...
arises
at
the
same
time
as
his
purchase.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
shows
both
what
they
resell
to
the
united
states
and
what
they
acquired.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
too,
on
that
subject.
do
you
think
that
the
exemption
that
the
state
allows
for
resales
to
the
united
states
is
constitutionally
compelled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
no
under
our--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--our
precedent,
i
think,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
no,
under
our
precedent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--constitutionally
compelled
to
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
claim
wouldn't
disappear
if
they
decided
to
tax
all
these
other
sovereigns.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
claim,
as
a
tribe,
would
not
disappear
if
they
decided
to
become
nondiscriminatory
and
tax
all
of
the
sales.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
exempting
distributor
to
distributor
taxes
just
means
that
only
one
distributor
has
to
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
that's
because
there
was
a
tax
on
the
first
sale
to
the
first
distributor.
and
may
i
ask
this?
supposing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
fuel--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--were
destroyed
by
flood
or
lightning
or
something
like...
before
it
was
resold
to
the
retailer,
there
would
be
no
tax--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
there
any
incidents
in
which
the
distributor
would
pay
the
tax
if
he
was
not
able
to
resell
it
to
somebody
else?
