mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
kansas
imposes
a
tax
on
the
distributors
of
motor
fuel.
the
legal
incidence
of
that
tax
is
explicitly,
by
statute,
imposed
on
the
distributor
of
the
first
receipt
of
the
fuel.
the
tax
is,
thus,
imposed
and
collected
off
reservation
from
non
indians.
the
who,
when,
and
where
of
the
tax
is
all
off
reservation
and
non
indian.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
had...
i
had
the
same
question,
justice
souter,
as
i
was
looking
at
this
yesterday.
and
i
investigated
it.
and
it
is
my
understanding,
but
i
did
not
find
this
completely
in
the
record,
that
the
distributor
is,
indeed,
paying
the
tax,
and
that
the
tribe
is
also
collecting
a
tax.
now,
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
reconcile
those
two
points
that
you've
just
raised.
if
it's...
if
it's
something
that
is
economically
not
possible,
how
can
it...
how
is
it
that
it's
being
done.
despite
the
fact
that
the
tenth
circuit
held
the
tax
impermissible,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
distributor
is
still
paying
the
tax.
now,
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--maybe
they
make
it
up
on
volume.
maybe
people
that
are
at
the
casino
are
willing
to
pay
more
of
the
tax.
there
is
a
differential
between
the
amount
of
the
state
tax
and
the
tribe
tax.
it's
only
a
couple
of
cents,
as
i
understand
it.
but
i
think
the
point--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
agree
with
that.
and
i
also
would
point
out--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yeah.
and
what...
i
think
that
what...
what
this
boils
down
to...
and
i'm
skipping
ahead
of
myself...
is
that
the
tribe
would
like
to
be
able
to
market
a
product
without
having
to
pay
the
burdens
of
taxation
all
the
way
upstream.
there
are
taxes
on
the
distributors'
property,
there's
taxes
that
are
imposed
when
the
fuel
comes
out
of
the
ground
and
at
the
refinery
stage.
so,
the
tribe
would
like
to
market
a
product
unburdened
by
any
upstream
taxation,
the
cost
of
doing
business--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
my
understanding...
and
this
is
explained...
the
details
of
this
are
explained
in
section
3410...
i
can't
give
you
a
citation
to
the
record,
but
the
statutes,
i'm
presuming,
are
available...
that
the
distributor
pays
a...
pays
a
tax
as
a
result
of
taking
the
fuel
down
from
what
they
call
the
rack,
and
then
taking
it
to
various
service
stations--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
statute
explicitly
says,
justice
o'connor...
this
is
on
page
2
of
the
petition...
the
incidence
of
this
tax
is
imposed
on
the
distributor
of
the
first
receipt
of
the
motor
fuel.
and
then
section...
that's
section
3408(c)...
section
3410
then
describes,
in
a
little
bit
more
detail,
the
physical
operation
of
the
reports
that
the
distributor
has
to
make,
and
the
distributor
has
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's...
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
the
receipt
that
triggers
the
liability
for
the
tax.
there
is
a...
an
exemption
that
may
be
taken
in
connection
with
sales
to
the
united
states,
and
that's
a
part
of
a
massive
quid
pro
quo
operation,
where
fuel
is
sold
to
the
united
states,
and
the
united
states
pays
the
state
back
substantially
all
of
the
tax
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
out
of
state,
there
is
a
deduction
for
fuel
sold
out
of
state.
that's
logical,
because
the
purpose
for
the
tax
is
to
pay
for
the
roads
in
kansas,
and
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think...
i
would
disagree
with
you,
justice
breyer.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
it's
my
understanding
that
if
you
sat
on
that
fuel
for
the
next
year--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--you'd
still
have
to
pay--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
tax.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
my
understanding.
now--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--with
respect
to
the
out
of
state
distribution--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
fuel
is
not
going
to
be
used
on--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--kansas
highways,
presumably.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
sometimes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
vast--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
one
of
my
responses
is
that
the
tribe
is
located
entirely
within
the
state.
the
record
is
clear
that
most
of
the
fuel
purchased
at
that
station
is
used
on
highways
paid
for
by
kansas.
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
fuel
is
not
used
on
a
reservation
road;
its
used
on
the
highways
of
the
state
of
kansas
to
get
to
the
casino
or
to
leave
the
casino.
the
road
that's
at
issue
in
this
case
is
1.5
miles
long.
the
rest
of
the
driving,
according
to
the
record,
is
on
the
highways
of
kansas.
so,
there's
a
clear
difference
there.
when
you
sell...
when
the
distributors
market
fuel
in
nebraska--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
we
would--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
would
argue
that
it
would
not
make
any
difference,
justice
stevens,
because
this
is
a
tax
on
distributors.
it
is...
the
legislature
of
kansas
followed
the
specific
advice
of
this
court
in
its
unanimous
opinion
in
the
chickasaw
nation
that
if
there
is
an
issue
with
respect
to
the
tax
being
imposed
on...
arguably
burdening
the
tribe,
the
state
can
change
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax.
that's
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
but
the
answer
is
that
this
is
an
entirely
off
reservation
tax
on
non
indians.
we're...
we
submit
that
there's
no
balancing
necessary
in
this
case
unless
you're
going
to
involve
an...
require
states
to
submit
to
litigation
and
engage
in
balancing
every
time
an
off
reservation
tax
on
non
indians
has
some
downstream
economic
effect.
but
what
about
the
tax
on
the
car
that
brings
the
casino
patron
to
the
reservation?
what
about
the
tax
on
the
cigarettes
or
the
alcohol
or
the
gambling
machinery?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
the
kaul
case,
in
the
context
of
deciding
whether
other
retailers
there
had
standing,
basically
said
that
there
was
an
economic
impact
that
affected
the
retailers.
the
kaul
case
specifically
referred,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
the
fact
that
the
legislature
had...
and
this
is
on
page
67
of
the
pacific
2nd
cite
of
the
kaul
opinion...
the
legislature
amended
the
statute...
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
second
column...
or
the
first
column...
to
clarify
the
question
where
the
incidence
of
taxation
falls.
the
legislature
provided
that,
unless
otherwise
specified,
the
incidence
of
the
tax
falls
on
the
distributor.
then,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
went
on
to
evaluate
the
standing
question
and
allowed
the
distributors
the...
to
raise
the
issue,
because
the
economic
burden
did
come
through
the
distributors.
it's
important,
in
that
context,
to
note
that
the
ultimate
burden
of
any
of
these
taxes
is
not
falling
on
the
retailer,
it's
falling
on
the
consumer.
it's
falling
on
the
consumer
of
the
gasoline.
the
consumer
puts
the
gasoline
in
the
car,
and
then
the
car
is
driven
overwhelmingly...
the
facts
are
unquestionable
in
this
case...
overwhelmingly
on
the
highways
of
the
state
of
kansas.
so
that
the
burden...
ultimately,
the
burden--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
still
would
be
true.
and...
but
the
fact
is,
in
this
case
you
have
a...
off
reservation
tax,
on
the...
all
distributors--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it...
what
the
statute
specifically
says...
this
is
section
3409...
it
says
that
the
distributor
may
pass
on...
"may"...
it's
a
permissive
provision...
may
pass
on
the
cost
of
the
taxation
as
a
part
of
the
cost
of
doing
business.
and,
of
course,
the
distributor
does
that
with
respect
to
the
cost
of
its
vehicles,
the
cost
of
other
taxes
it
pays.
it
may
include
those
provisions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
what
it
means...
i
understand,
justice
scalia,
and
i...
because
i've
had
the
same
reaction,
"well,
of
course
he
could.
"
"why
does
he
need
a
statute
to
do
that?
"
"it
is
a
cost
of
doing
business.
"
i
think
that
provision
is
a
part
of
the
effort
to
make
clear
one
of
the
factors
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
chickasaw
nation
case,
where
the
court
found
that
it
was
significant
that
the
distributor
was
required
to
pass
on
the
tax,
act
as
a
collection
agent
for
the
retailer,
and
took
a
1.5
percent
commission.
so,
this
court
thought
that
might
be
significant.
kansas,
in
part,
i
think,
want
to
make...
wanted
to
make
it
very
clear
that
the...
what
was
happening
in
the
economic
chain
is
cost
of
production
of
gasoline,
including
tax
paid
by
the
distributor,
could
be
passed
on
in
the
form
of
cost
of
business
to
the
retailer.
now,
of
course
its
cost...
it
passed
on,
also,
to
the
consumer.
the
question--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is
unclear
from
this
court's
decisions
precisely
what
"legal
incidence"
means.
at
least
it
was
unclear
to
me
as
i
was
looking
through
the
court's
decisions.
but
i
think
it's
a
combination
of
the
liability
for
the
tax,
the
responsibility
to
pay
the
tax,
the
fact
that...
in
this
case,
the
retailer
has
no
liability
for
the
tax.
the
only
liability
for
the
tax
is
on
the
distributor.
the
relationship
is
between
the
state
of
kansas
and
the
distributor.
and
all
of
those
factors
together
make
it
clear
to
me,
from
this
court's
previous
decisions,
that
"legal
incidence"
is
a
term
of
art,
especially
in
the
field
of
taxation.
and,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
chickasaw
nation
case,
it's
important
to
have
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
bright
lawyer
in
kansas
who
may
have
done
that
was
the
kansas
legislature,
following
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
in
chickasaw
nation,
saying,
"if
you
want
to
avoid
the
potential
problems
that
would
exist,
change.
"
--and
it's
not
just
the
incidence
of
the
tax,
it's
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax,
it's...
of
course,
the
economic
burden
of
taxation
is
spread
out
throughout
the
chain
of
distribution.
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax,
as
i
read
this
court's
opinions,
are...
is,
it
is
exactly
what
it
is
here,
the
distributor
must
pay
for
the
tax,
the
distributor
must
account
for
the
tax,
the
distributor
is
liable
and
may
be
penalized
if
the
tax
is
not
paid.
nobody
else
is
liable
for
it.
the
distributor
has
to
pay
the
tax
even
if
it
doesn't
sell
the
gasoline.
here,
not
only
the
language
is
as
clear
as
it
could
be...
i
mean,
the
legislature
specifically
says
it...
but
the
operation
of
the
statute...
and
the
two...
the...
twice,
the
tenth
circuit
considered
this...
the
tenth
circuit
decided
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
was
on
the
distributor.
the
two
district
courts
that
decided
it
before
those
two
tenth
circuit
decisions,
decided
that
the
legal
incidence
was
on
the
distributor.
the
facts
support
that
the
legal
incidence
is
on
the
distributor.
and
respondents,
on
page
16
of
the
respondent's
brief,
it
seems
to
me,
acknowledge
precisely
that.
they,
in
their
effort
to
distinguish
the
central
machinery
case,
which
is
the
indian
taxation
statutes...
and
we're
not...
specifically
said
there,
referring
to
central
machinery,
"the
state
tax
was
imposed
on
the
sale
of
merchandise.
"
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
there,
as
here,
fell
on
the
non
indian
seller.
"so,
the
respondents
have
even
said
that,
on
page
16
of
their
own
brief.
"
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
not
my
understanding.
i
may
be
wrong.
but,
as
i
read
section
3410,
the
distributor
must
file
monthly
reports
with
the
state
describing
the
amount
of
tax
it's
drawn
down
at
the
rack
when
it
takes
the...
unloads
fuel
into
its
trucks.
and
it's
responsible
monthly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
not
my
understanding.
the...
it
is
not...
the
incidence...
or
the
occasion
for
the
payment
of
the
tax
isn't
a
sale
to
a
retailer.
you'd
have...
i
can
imagine
the
practicalities
of
that
would
drive
everybody
crazy.
the
distributor--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
of
course...
of
course,
the
distributor
is
drawing
it
down
to
sell
fuel
to
gasoline
stations.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
may...
there
may
be
some
storage
involved,
there
may
be
other
occasions.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
distributor
files
a
monthly
report
describing
how
much
fuel
is...
it
receives.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
this
is...
this
is
an
effort
by
the
legislature
to
say
that
fuel,
which
is
going
to
be
used
in
kansas,
by
and
large...
there's
always
going
to
be
exceptions...
fuel
that
is
used,
by
and
large,
in
kansas
on
the
roads
of
kansas,
shall
be
subject
to
a
tax
so
that
those
roads
can
be
built
and
maintained.
now,
how
shall
we,
mechanically,
impose
and
collect
that
tax?
we
will
do
it
on
the
first
receipt
by
the
distributor.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
know
the
answer.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
would
say
that
the...
that
if
the...
this
court's
prior
decisions
have
any
consistent
meaning,
that
the
person
who
has
the
obligation
to
pay
the
tax,
and
who
might
claim
some
credits
or
deductions,
like
we
all
do
when
we
file
our
tax
returns,
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
us,
as
taxpayers.
the
taxpayer
here
is
the
distributor.
the
statute
says
so.
the
way
the
statute
works--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think,
but
i
can't
represent
to
you
know
that
i
know
for
sure,
that
that
is
an
accounting
process
that
takes
place.
because
these
are
transactions...
thousands
of
transactions
that
are
taking
place
all
of
the
time.
kansas
also
has
a
practical
reason
for
imposing
this
tax
on
the
distributors.
there
are
x
number
of
distributors.
you
can
imagine
how
many
times
x
there
might
be
retailers
and
how
many
different
disputes
and
so
forth.
the
point...
one
of
the
points
that
this
court
has
repeated
made
in
connection
with
tax
cases,
and
intersovereign
immunity
issues
with
respect
to
tax
cases,
it
is
vitally
important
that
there
be
certainty,
predictability,
and
some
understanding
of
fixed
events
with
respect
to
taxation.
states
can't
be
engaged
in
litigation
constantly,
depending
upon
how
many
casino
customers
were
here,
how
many
people
bought
this
gasoline,
how
many
people
bought
that
gasoline
the
next
month,
and
how
much
did
the
tribe
charge
for
the
gasoline
on
its
reservation.
that
kind
of
balancing
process
makes
no
sense
whatsoever,
and
it...
and
it
sentences
the
states
to
litigation,
and
this
court
to
repeated
decisions,
based
upon
specific
facts.
that's
why,
we
submit,
that
although
the
balancing
is
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
the
state,
because
it's
a
tax
for
gas
that
will
enable
someone
to
drive
on
roads
that
the
state
has
to
pay
for,
that,
in
this
situation,
one
balancing
test
makes
little
sense.
it
simply
invites
litigation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
was
not
able
to
find
it,
either,
in
the
briefs.
it's...
the
kansas...
it's
the...
it's
in
the
kansas
statutes,
of
course,
but
i
couldn't
find
it
set
out
verbatim
in
the...
in
the
briefs.
i
suspect
it's
in
there
someplace,
but
i
couldn't
find
it
when
i
was
looking.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the...
it's
a
matter
of
economics,
justice
ginsburg,
just
as
your
question
suggests.
the
tribe
would
not...
would
like
to
be
able
to
market
tax
free
fuel
at
its
nonregulated
casino.
it
would...
probably
would
like...
and
if
this
case
is
decided
against
the
state,
it
would
probably
not
like
to
pay
the
tax
on
the...
on
the
car
that
brings
the
patron--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
wouldn't
have
to
use
a
tax
to
do
that.
it
owns
the
station.
it
would--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--precisely
the
point,
that
the
tribe
would
probably
not
like
to
pay
the
taxes
that
are
paid
by
the
distributor
or
the
refiner
or
the
person
that
brings
the
fuel...
the
petroleum
product
out
of
the
ground.
what
it...
what
it
simply
means
is,
the
margin
between
the
cost
and
the
sale,
that's
what
the
tribe
would
like.
it's
perfectly
understandable.
but
it
would
like
to
have
that
and...
that
tax...
and
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal...
but
that
tax
is
overwhelmingly
used
on
the
roads
of
kansas...
overwhelming
used
on
the
roads
of
kansas...
which
are
paid
for,
built,
and
maintained
with
the
revenue
produced
by
that
taxation.
that's
what
it's
for.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
kaul--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--kaul
case?
i
read...
i
don't
think
the
kansas
supreme
court
could
have
been
any
more
clear.
it
said
the
legislature
amended
the
legislation
to
clarify
where
the
incidence
of
taxation
falls.
it
provided
that
the
incidence
of
the
tax
falls
on
the
distributor.
then,
in
victa,
in
connection
with
the
standing
issue,
because
economic
burden
fell
on
the
retailers,
it
found
that
the
retailers
and...
those
other
retailers
had
standing.
kansas
could
not
have
been
more
clear.
in
section
3401(f)(3),
it
defines
a
"distributor"
as
someone
who
receives
the
product.
in
3408(c),
it's...
taxes
the
distributor
on
the
first
receipt
of
the
tax.
in
3410,
it
again
says
it's
on
the
distributor.
two
district
courts
and
two
courts
of
appeals
found
that
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
was
on
the
distributor.
the
kansas
supreme
court
said
the
same
thing,
the
distributor
is
liable
for
the
tax,
pays
the
tax.
the
retailer
has
no
liability
for
the
tax.
what
in
the
world
can
kansas
do
to
make
it
clearer?
now,
the
central
machinery
case
that's...
that
my
opponents
have
been
speaking
about
is
a
case
that
was
decided
under
the
indian
trader
statutes
with
respect
to
the
trading
with
the
indians,
with
respect
to
central
machinery
case,
was...
over
tractors
sold
on
the
reservation
for
use
on
the
reservation.
it
fell
within
the
scope
of
the
indian
trader
statute.
but
this
court
has
made
clear,
in
a
number
of
cases,
the
indian
trader
statutes
would
not
remotely
apply.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
they're...
it
hasn't
really
been
mentioned
until
the...
i
mean,
hardly
mentioned
at
all,
until
the
government
decided
to...
the
united
states
government
decided
to
discuss
that
point.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
statute
could
not
be
more
clear,
justice
scalia.
it
is
the
receipt
by
the
distributor
of
the
fuel.
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
it
is
as
plain--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--as
it
could
be.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there's
an
exemption
for
losses
like...
one
of
the
court's
questions
with
respect
to
a
casualty
loss
or
something
that...
but
it's
limited.
the
liability,
nonetheless,
exists
on
the
distributor.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that...
i
think
the
reading
of
the
statute
is
plain.
if
the
distributor
took
the
fuel,
kept
it,
decided
to
warehouse
it
because
the
costs
are
going
up
or
something
like
that,
it
would
still
have
to
pay
the
tax,
because
the
tax
is
on
the
receipt
by
the
distributor.
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
would
those
other
exemptions,
the
united
states
government
be
required
by
the
constitution,
or
the
other
states?
no,
not
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
blaze
case,
which,
as
i
understood
it,
was
unanimous.
the
fresno
case,
u.s.
vs.
new
mexico,
it's
not
a
tax
on
the
united
states.
it's...
or
an
agency
of
the
united
states.
so
they
wouldn't
be
required.
but
they
make
sense,
because
the
sales
to
other
states
are
for
people
that
drive
on
other
states'
highways.
the
sales
to
the
united
states
government
is
an
exchange
for
almost
the
same
amount
of
money
that
comes
back.
so,
there's
a
rational
purpose.
it's
not
discrimination.
the
tribe
makes
the
point
that
it's
generating
real
value
and
reservation
value.
this
is
fuel
that's
used
in
cars
that
are...
drive
all
over
the
state
of
kansas.
the
casino
is
there,
so
people
come
to
the
casino.
and,
under
cabazon,
there
might
be
some
value
added
by
the
casino,
which,
by
the
way,
is
an
exempt
value
created
by
an
exemption
from
regulation.
but
the
value
for
someone
who
puts
fuel
in
their
car
is
so
that
that
car
will
then
drive.
and
that...
cars
that
drive,
in
this
case,
drive
on
kansas
highways.
this,
ultimately
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--thank
you.
