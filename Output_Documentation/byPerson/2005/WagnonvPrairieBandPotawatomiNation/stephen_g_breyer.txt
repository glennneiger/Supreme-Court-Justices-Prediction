justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
that's
the
problem,
right
there,
because
i
thought...
first,
there
is
a
tax...
you
get
a
credit
if
you
don't
sell
the
fuel
to
anybody.
so,
i
don't
think
it's
quite...
if
you
just
sit
there
with--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--maybe
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
don't?
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you'd
still
have
to
pay
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
on--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
kansas.
you
sell...
the
retailer
in
kansas
sells
it
to
nebraska.
nebraska
is,
in
a
sense,
a
foreign
and
independent
state.
and
i
guess,
at
some
level,
the
tribes
are
arguing,
"well,
you
sell
to
us,
our
local
retailer.
"
"we,
too,
are
a
foreign
and
independent
state,
even
more
so.
"
"so,
if
you're
going
to
treat
them
this
way...
give
the
people
in
nebraska
a
credit
so
they
don't
have
to
pay...
why
don't
you
treat
us
that
way?
"
"we
drive
on
kansas
roads
sometimes.
"
"so
do
the
nebraskans--
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--"#
sometimes".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
they
say...
get
into
interest
balancing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what...
now
you
have
the
whole
argument
that
i'm
thinking
of.
what
do
you
respond?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
strange
about
it?
i
mean,
every
upstream
tax,
as
mr.
olson
said,
raises
the
price
of
goods
and
services.
and
it's
harder
to
retail
them,
because
they
cost
more.
so,
that's
true
of
every
single
good
sold
on
the
reservation.
so
i
take
it
your
claim
must...
and,
of
course,
it
may
or
may
not
be
true
that
the
tribe
can
put
a
tax
on
that.
it
depends
upon
supply
and
demand--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
suppose
they
can't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
my
question
is,
if
we
hold
for
you
here,
and
we
don't
take
an
absolute
principle,
well,
i
guess
states
are
forbidden
to
put
any
upstream
taxes
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
ought
to
know,
because
they've
been...
haven't
they
had
this
for
a
while?
so,
there
must
be
a
dealer
somewhere
who's
not
on
the
reservation...
he's
a
distributor...
somebody
delivered
to
him
a
thousand
gallons,
and
it's
sitting
there
in
his
tank.
doe
he
have
to
pay
the
tax,
or
doesn't
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
he
would--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--pay
the
tax,
then
it
is
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
his--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--redistribution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
is...
sorry...
if...
i'd
like
to
ask
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
and
you
can
say
why
this
is
wrong...
if
he
gets
a
thousand
gallons
from
whoever...
exxon
or
somebody...
and
he
puts
it
in
the
tank,
and
he
hasn't
sold
it,
and
he
has
to
pay
the
tax,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
sale
on
the
distribution
to
him,
not
the
sale
on
his
distribution
to
somebody
else.
now,
why
is
that
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
now
you're
telling
me
something
different
from
what
i
understood.
i
thought
you
said
it
probably
has
happened
in
the
history
of
this
tax--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
a
distributor
picked
up
a
gallon
of
fuel,
held
it,
and
has
not
yet
redistributed
it.
so,
you're
saying
that's
never
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i'm
certain
about
what
the
tax
is
on,
what
should
we
do?
dismiss
the
case
or
send
it
to
the...
ask
a
question,
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
suppose
you're
right.
can
you
answer
my
first
question?
can
you
even
remember
it?
i'll
summarize.
on
your
assumption.
look,
the
indians,
if
there
is
a
tax...
they
have
a
retail
shop
or
they
have
things
on
the
reservation,
they
go
buy
them...
kansas
can't
impose
a
tax
on
what
goes
on,
on
the
reservation.
we
go
through
the
balance.
but
they
certainly
could
impose
a
tax
on
the
department
store
in
kansas
city,
couldn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so,
the
indian
then
goes
to
the
department
store
and
buys
it.
he
has
to
pay
the
tax,
doesn't
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now
what
he
does,
he
says,
"call
up
and"...
he
says,
"please
deliver
it".
now
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
tax?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
commerce
constitutionally--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we're
now
talking
federal
rules.
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
if
balancing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
how
do
you
come
out?
because
what
they're
saying
is,
"okay,
balance.
"
"fine.
"
"you
want
to
balance?
"
"here's
how
you
balance.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
one
hand,
the
indians
have
to
pay
the
tax.
okay,
that's
true.
and
it's
harder
for
them
to
impose
their
own
tax.
that's
true
of
every
upstream
tax.
and
it
goes
for
roads
that
they
use
all
the
time.
and
they
just
have
a
one
and
a
half
mile...
and
why
shouldn't
they
be
treated
every...
like
everybody
else,
when
they're
going
to
use
the
roads
the
tax
pays
for?
so,
the
balancing
works
in
their
favor.
now,
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
a
winning...
of
course
it
is
different,
in
the
sense
you
say,
but
if,
in
fact,
it's
an
interference...
look,
every
upstream
tax
raises
the
price
of
goods
and
services.
every
upstream
tax...
indeed,
every
tax
in
the
world...
makes
it
harder
to
sell
the
product.
so,
every
tax
makes
it
harder
for
the
tribe
to
tax
that
item
which
was
taxed
by
somebody
else.
now,
if
that's
the
basis
for
saying
it's
an
interference,
then
every
tax
is
an
interference.
and
i
don't
see
how
that
could
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
so
far,
your
theory
is
based
on
economics,
as
i've
heard
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
it
isn't,
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
incidence
of
the
tax--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
very
surprising.
when
i
read
the
statute,
it
doesn't
have
one
word
about
the
retailer
being
obliged
to
pay--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
if
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax,
i
would
think
their
side
would
win,
in
my
mind.
now
suppose,
actually,
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
not
on
that
retailer,
but,
rather,
is
on
the
distributor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
and
if
we
get
into
balancing,
which
i
don't
know,
what
is
to
be
said
in
favor
of
the
indian
side?
it
sounded
to
me
as
if
it's
harder
for
them
to
tax.
so,
i'm
thinking,
well,
that's
true
of
every
tax.
and
then,
put
it
on
something
else.
put
it
on
the
tires.
put
it
on
anything
else,
if
you
can.
it'll
be
harder
for
them
to
tax
nonindians.
but
i
didn't
know
they
had
a
federal
right
to
tax
the
nonindians.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
one
other...
the
interest
other
than
the
interest
on
being
able
to
tax
an
item
that
an
upstream
tax
prevents
you
from
doing
because
of
the
economics?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the
only
one,
or
are
there
other
ones?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
got
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
want
to
hear
you
and
know
if
there's
an
additional
one.
i'm
not
disputing
that
one.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
get
them
all.
one
is...
one
is
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
else?
