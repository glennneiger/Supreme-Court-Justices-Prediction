justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
olson,
may
i
ask
you
to
go
one
step
beyond
that
on
an
issue
of
fact
that
i
just
don't
understand
from
reading
the
briefs?
let
me
give
you
three
quick
quotations.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
contains
this
statement,
"an
expert
on
behalf
of
the
tribe
reported
that
basic
economic
theory
teaches
that
the
nation's
station
cannot
charge
prices
high
enough
to
allow
collection
of
both
the
kansas
and
the
nation's
fuel
taxes.
"
the
red
brief
says,
on
page
8,
"it
is
undisputed
that
enforcing
the
state
tax
on
fuel
sold
and
delivered
to
the
station
would
effectively
nullify
the
tribal
fuel
tax.
"
finally,
the
yellow
brief,
on
page
13,
says,
"by
selling
its
fuel
at
market
prices,
respondent.
"
--the
tribe...
"is
making
both
a
profit
and
collecting
a
tax.
"
my
question
is,
do
we
know,
from
the
record,
whether
the
tax
that
is
assessed
on
the
distributor
is,
in
fact,
passed
through
to
the
tribe
so
that,
in
economic
effect,
the
tribe
is
collecting,
via
pass
through,
the
state
tax
and
imposing
its
own
tax
and
still
selling
at
market
prices?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if...
if
i
may
interrupt
you...
if
it's
getting
passed
through,
and
they're
still
selling
their
gas,
then
there's
no...
then
the
tribe
cannot
make
an
argument
here
that
their
sovereign
taxing
authority
is
being
compromised
or
threatened.
and
the
argument,
basically,
would
boil
down
to
the
argument
that
they
want
to
make
a
bigger
profit.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
one
factual
nuance
on
that?
apart
from
legal
incidence,
somebody
mentioned
earlier
that
the
tax
would
not
necessarily
be
payable
until,
in
fact,
the
gasoline
was
distributed
to
the
retailer.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
a
surrogate
for
sale
to
the...
well,
i
guess
what
i'm
getting
at,
the
tax
apparently
is
not
payable
when
the
distributor
receives
the
fuel,
but
only
when
the
distributor
transfers
the
fuel
to
a
retailer.
justice
david
h.
souter
no?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
would
he
be
drawing
it
down,
except
to
sell--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
collecting
that
tax?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what's
its
gripe?
it
wants
a
bigger
profit?
it
wants
to
increase--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
taxation?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
the
tribe
is
collecting...
it's
assuming
that...
if
the
tribe
is
collecting
its
tax,
and
it
does
not
have
a
claim
to
greater
taxation
or
greater
profit,
then
how
is
its
sovereign
right
as
a
taxing
authority
being
interfered
with?
justice
david
h.
souter
loss
of
profit--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
an
entrepreneur.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't...
i
mean,
isn't
that
necessarily
the
case?
if
it's
collecting
all
of
its
tax,
then
what
it's
complaining
about
is
that
it's
getting
less
profit
as
the...
as
the
retailer.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
is
that
an
issue
that
we
should
consider
on
a
question
of
preemption
which
arises
from
the
tribe's
assertion
of
sovereignty?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
other
words--
justice
david
h.
souter
--should
we,
in
effect,
say
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
tribe's
position
as
sovereign
and
the
tribe's
position
as
retail
gasoline
seller.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they're
similar,
because
it...
ultimately,
it's
all
going
into
the
same
pocket.
we
realize
that.
but,
unless
there
is
a
claim
that
its
taxing
authority,
as
such,
is
being
threatened
or
interfered
with,
i
don't
quite
see
why
a
preemption
theory
that
rests
upon
tribal
sovereignty
has
any
place
in
the
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
operating
at
a
loss.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
your
view
generally
was
that
it
was...
that
it
was
indicative
of
discrimination.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
thought
that
was
the
stronger
argument,
because
the...
you're
saying,
"look,
the
state
has
only
the
most
trivial
interest
in
the
amount
of
taxation
it
would
get
here.
"
that
would
be
equally
true
whether
it
forgives
taxes
that...
on
fuel
that
goes
to
the
united
states
or
not.
but
the
discrimination
point,
if
it's
a
fair
one,
would
be
the
same.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
being
interfered
with?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
expert
opinion
is
that,
as
an
economic
matter,
you
can't
collect
both.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can't
impose
both.
but
the
tribe
is
still
imposing
its
tax,
and
it's
getting
every
penny
that
it...
that
it
purports
to
impose.
justice
david
h.
souter
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume...
let's
assume
that
is
true.
what
difference
does
that
make
to
an
analysis
based
on
a
preemption
theory
which
is
supposed
to
take
account
of
tribal
sovereignty?
the
sovereign
act
is
not
selling
gas,
it's
taxing.
they
are
taxing.
they're
getting
everything
they
want
under
their
tax
statute.
where,
then,
is
there
a
basis
for
a
preemption--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
i
mean,
it
was--
justice
david
h.
souter
--an
entirely
separate...
an
entirely
separate
rationale.
it
was
saying
the
tribe
is
getting
this
tremendous
advantage
by...
or
wants
this
tremendous
advantage...
by
marketing
the
exemption.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe...
maybe
it
contemplated
that,
and
maybe
it
simply
contemplated
that
that
particular...
that
particular
argument
against
it...
i.e.,
that
it
was
simply
selling
a
tax
exemption...
would
not
have
been
an
argument
against
it.
but
it
doesn't
follow,
from
that,
that
the
tribe
would
necessarily
have
had
a
winning
argument
on
a
preemption
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
kansas
has
not
indicted
the
distributor
for
failing
to
register
under
the
indian
trading
statute.
