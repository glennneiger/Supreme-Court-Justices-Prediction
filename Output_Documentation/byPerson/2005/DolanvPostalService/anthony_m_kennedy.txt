justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
have
a
big
crate
that
the
postman
uses,
because
you've
been
away
for
a
week
and
yet
the
mail...
and
he
leaves
a
crate
there,
and
you
trip
on
the
crate.
under
your
view,
there
would
be
liability,
because
the
crate's
like
the...
the
crate
isn't
the
mail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
is
mail--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--mail
specific
any
different
than
the
grocery
boy...
i
mean,
than
the
grocery
specific,
under
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you're
saying...
you're...
you
want
us
to
say
that
mail
is
somehow
unique.
but
it
isn't.
there's
all
kinds
of
delivery.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
saying--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
not
mail
specific,
because
all
delivery
people
have
the
same
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
why
is
it
mail
specific?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
ask
you
about
defenses.
and
it
goes
a
little
bit
beyond
the
suit,
but,
as
i...
i
read
through
the
regulations,
and
it's
the
duty
of
the
occupant,
or
the
recipient,
of
the
mail
to
provide
a
box
or
a
letter
slot
or
something.
would
the
failure
to
do
that,
so
that
they
just
have
to
put
it
on
the
porch...
is
that
a
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
there's
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
does
not
prevail
here.
does
the
post
office
have
a
defense
if
the
person
doesn't
provide
a
mailbox,
as
the
regulations
require?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
there--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
there
regulations
requiring
that
the
mail
be
put
in
a
reasonably
safe
place?
and
by
that,
i
mean
reasonably
safe
for
the
occupant,
not
reasonably
safe
for
the
mail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
because
you
quote...
you
quote,
on
page
2,
the
footnote...
you
quote
the
regulation.
but
i
read
that,
that
it
has
to
be
reasonably
safe
for
the
mail,
because
it
says,
"oh,
you
can
leave
it
on
a
stairway
or
under
a
porch,
just
so
long
as
it's
safe
for
the
mail.
"
that's
the
way
i
read
that
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
my
point--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--my
point
is,
if
there's
a
duty,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
post
office
is
used
to
making
these
judgments.
and
if
it
does
not
make
the
correct
judgment,
it
can
be
sued.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
saying--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
you're
creating
a
cause
of
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
just
saying
that
you're
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
much
different
than
any
institution
faced
with
slip
and
fall
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
you're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you're
using
the
word
"deliver",
but
the
statutory
word
is
"transmit".
and...
are
there
other
statutes
or
regulations
in
respect
to
the
post
office
that
talk
about
"delivery"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
word...
because
it
seems
to
me...
the
omission
of
"delivery",
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
real
problem
for
you,
in
your
theory
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
does--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
person
who
trips
doesn't
say,
"oh,
this
really
hurts
me
because
it's
mail
instead
of
a
box
of
oranges.
"
does
he?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
the
chief
justice
indicates,
this
is
our
opinion
in
dolan
versus
united
states
postal
service.
barbara
dolan
alleged
that
the
united
states
postal
service
left
mail
on
her
front
porch
at
her
residence
and
that
that
caused
her
to
slip
and
fall.
she
sued
the
postal
service
for
resulting
injuries.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
her
suit
dismissed,
and
now
mrs.
dolan
is
the
petitioner
in
this
court
and
she
asks
us
to
rule
that
the
suit
can
proceed.
the
postal
service
is
an
independent
establishment
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
that
means
that
it
enjoys
immunity
from
suit
unless
the
immunity
has
been
waived.
the
question
here
is
whether
there
has
been
a
waiver
for
suits
of
this
type.
the
case
turns
on
provisions
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
act
contains
a
broad
waiver
of
immunity,
but
the
waiver
has
some
exceptions.
if
one
of
the
exceptions
applies,
then
the
immunity
from
suit
has
been
retained.
the
exception
relevant
to
this
case
specifically
applies
to
the
postal
service,
and
the
question
we
must
decide
is
how
far
that
exception
extends.
“by
turns
of
the
exception,
immunity
is
retained,”
which
means
suit
is
barred,
“for
claims
arising
out
of
a
loss,
miscarriage
or
negligent
transmission
of
letters
or
postal
matters”,
and
the
key
phrase
for
us
here
is
the
meaning
of
“negligent
transmission”.
if
considered
in
isolation,
that
term
could
embrace
a
wide
range
of
negligent
acts
committed
in
the
course
of
delivering
mail.
this
could
include
the
creation
of
slip-and-fall
hazards
from
leaving
mail
packets
and
parcels
on
the
porch
of
a
customer.
the
government
urges
us
to
adopt
that
interpretation.
it
notes
that
each
day,
the
postal
service
delivers
some
660
million
pieces
of
mail
to
as
many
as
142
million
different
points.
it
is
obviously
concerned,
then,
with
the
potential
for
liability
from
slip-and-fall
suits.
we
think,
though,
that
we
must
read
“negligent
transmission”
in
the
statute
in
light
of
the
more
narrow
phrase
“loss
or
miscarriage
of
the
mail”,
phrases
which
precede
it
in
the
same
statutory
clause.
these
words
refer
to
destruction
of
the
mail
or
delivering
to
the
wrong
address
or
delivering
it
late;
and
we
do
not
write
on
a
clean
slate
in
this
case.
in
a
decision
by
this
court
in
a
case
called
kosak
v.
united
states,
the
court
held
that
this
provision
does
not
retain
immunity
for
injuries
resulting
from
auto
accidents
in
which
employees
of
the
postal
service
were
allegedly
at
fault.
applying
that
reasoning
here,
we
think
the
exception
does
not
extend
to
this
case;
the
exception
as
a
general
rule
does
not
go
beyond
negligence
causing
mail
to
be
lost
or
to
arrive
late
or
in
damaged
condition
or
at
the
wrong
address.
in
sum,
mrs.
dolan’s
suit
can
proceed,
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
3rd
circuit
must
be
reversed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
