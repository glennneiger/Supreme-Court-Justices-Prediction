mr.
radmore,
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
enactment
of
the
waiver
of
federal
sovereign
immunity
here?
was
it
to
allow
recovery
for
auto
accidents
occurring
by
postal
trucks?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
basically
the
purpose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
arising--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--out
of
auto
accidents.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
we
normally
construe
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
narrowly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
auto
accidents.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
why
should
we
interpret
the
exception
broadly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
your
theory
is
basically
that
the
exception
just
deals
with
bad
things
that
happen
to
the
mail.
