but
you're
using--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're...
no,
please.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
taking
as
your
prime...
or
a
prime
example
of
what
would
be
covered
by
the
exception
of
"negligent
transmission"
the
package
that
is
delivered
to
the
right
place
on
time
and
all
the
china
inside
the
box
is
smashed.
i
mean,
that
would
be
an
example
that
would
fit
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
would...
you
would
say
that's
supported
by
the...
you
know,
the
noscitur
a
sociis
argument,
because
it's
damage
of...
to
the
mail,
or
the
condition
of
the
mail,
or
the
manner
in
which
the
mail
itself
is
delivered,
but
it...
that's
more
or
less
where
you...
where
you
think
the
exception
should
stop.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
would
be,
in
each
case...
in
each
example
you're
giving,
as
i
understand
it,
that
would
be
as
a
consequence
to
a
violation
that
affected
the
mail,
itself,
in
the
first
place.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
lose
the...
i
lose
the
money,
because
the
mail
is
slow,
or
whatever.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
on
the...
on
the
truck
accident
and
on
the
package
that
falls
out
of
the
truck...
is
that
the
fact
that
mail
transmission
is
going
on
at
the
same
time
is
utterly
irrelevant
to
the
cause
of
the
damage.
and
isn't
it
equally
open
to
the...
isn't
your
position
equally
open
to
the
argument
that,
when
the
person
trips
over
the
package
on
the
porch,
it
is
utterly
irrelevant
that
that
package
has
been
placed
there
by
a
postal
employee
and
has
been
carried
in
the
mail?
it
is
in
the
same...
it
has
the
same
character,
vis
a
vis
tripping,
that
a
brick
or
a
rock
or
any
other
package
might
have.
so,
if
you're
going
to
be
consistent
with
respect
to
the
passage
of
the
truck,
the
package
that
drops
out
of
the
truck,
and
the
piece...
and
the
package
on
the
porch,
don't
you
have
to
say
it
is
irrelevant
that
the
package
in
the
porch
has
been
carried
in
the
mail
and
put
there
by
a
postal
employee?
it's
its
character
of
package
at
that
place
that
matters.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
can
say...
then
you
can
say
exactly
the
same
thing
about
the
package
that
falls
off
the
truck.
you
can
characterize
that.
you
can
say,
"look,
it
wouldn't
have
been
in
the
truck
if
they
weren't
delivering
mail.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
pardon
me?
but
you...
and
you
could
say
that
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
accident
with
the
truck
if
the
truck
hadn't
been
delivering
mail.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
that...
this
is
neither
here
nor
there,
i
guess,
but
would
that
be
within
the
waiver?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
only--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
you
weren't
intention...
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--intent
was
not
to
deliver
anthrax.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
intent
is
to
hit
the
person
with
the
alligator
that
you're
swinging--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
would
be
an
intentional--
justice
david
h.
souter
--tort
in--
