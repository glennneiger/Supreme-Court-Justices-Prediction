justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
we've
already
construed
it
broadly,
haven't
we,
in...
or,
excuse
me...
yes,
construed
the
waiver
broadly.
in
kosak
versus
united
states,
we
allowed
a
suit
against
the
united
states
for
negligence
of
a
mail
truck
in
an
automobile
accident.
i
suppose
the
language
could
have
covered
that,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
been
within
the
literal.
it
could
have
been
negligent...
what
is
it
+/?
negligence--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
delivery
of
mail?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
cover,
under
your
theory,
this
very
act,
just
dumping
the
stuff
there
on
the
porch,
if
the
consequence
of
that
had
not
been
that
the
homeowner
tripped
over
it,
but
that
rain
destroyed
the
contents
of
the...
of
the
letters
so
that
they
were
illegible.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--say
that
that
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--be
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
in...
it
seems
to
me
a
little
strange
that
this
same
act
is
both
within
the
exception
and
not
within
the
exception,
the
same
act
of
negligence.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
good
answer.
i'm
glad
you
came
up
with
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
you're
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
negligence
transmission.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
your
last...
your
last
answer.
you
think
bopping
somebody
on
the
head
in
the
course
of
delivering
a
package
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
the...
you
assert
that
would
be
the
case,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
assert
that
they
would
be
able
to
sue.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
gotcha.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
covers
damage,
for
one
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
"loss"
doesn't,
and
"miscarriage"
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
letters
are
carried
in
a
mail
truck,
but
we
allow
a
cause
of
action
for
negligence
of
the
driver
of
the
mail
truck.
that's
unique
to
mail,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
leaving
something--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
was
the
very
point,
leaving
something
on
the
porch
where
somebody
can
trip
on
it
isn't
unique
to
mail--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
as
driving
a
truck
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
you...
my
biggest
hangup...
and
i
wish
you'd
go
through
your
distinguishing
of
it
again...
is
the...
is
the
kosak
case.
carrying
the
mail
in
a
mail
truck
is
the
handling
of
the
mail.
there
is
no
doubt
that
it's
the
handling
of
the
mail.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
doesn't...
it
isn't
enough
to
say,
"well,
other
people
drive
trucks,
too.
"
well,
that's
true.
but
other
people
deliver
packages,
too,
and
leave
'em
on
the
doorstep.
how
do
you
distinguish
kosak?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
i
assume
the
government
has
conceded
kosak,
the
dictum
in
kosak.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
do
you
concede
that
point,
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
concede
the
point,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
dictum.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
are
trying
to
draw
a
distinction
between
driving
the
mail
in
the
truck
and
leaving
the
mail
on
the
doorstep.
what's
the
basis
for
that
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
your
last
distinction.
you
say
there
is
no
liability
for
the
package
that
falls
off
the
back
of
the
truck,
but
there
is
liability
if
the
truck
hits
another
vehicle.
i
really
don't
understand
the
basis
for
that
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
happens
all
the
time
in
other
trucks,
not
just
mail
trucks.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
the
driving
of
the
truck
that
contains
the
mail.
justice
antonin
scalia
same
thing
with
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--same
thing
with
the
person
who
veers
to
avoid
the
package
that
falls
off
the
back
of
the
mail
truck.
justice
antonin
scalia
she
says
that.
