wouldn't
the
term
"negligent
transmission"
probably
cover
late
deliveries?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
incorrect
deliveries
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
the
wrong
address,
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
isn't
your
response
to
justice
scalia...
you
could
make
the
same
argument.
if
there's
an
accident,
and
the
truck
caught
on
fire,
and
the
mail
was
destroyed,
you
couldn't
recover
for
the
lost
mail
in
the
truck,
but
you
could...
but
you
could
recover
for
personal
injury
resulting
from
the
accident.
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
radmore,
i
don't
think
you're
quite
correct
when
you
say,
with
regard
to
an
automobile
accident,
it's
just
like
a
private
entity
delivering
mail...
or
delivering
packages.
if
a
private
delivery
service
had
an
automobile
accident
that
resulted
in
the
destroy...
destruction
of
a
package,
a
private
party
could
sue
for
the
contents
of
the
package.
but
that's
not
true
with
regard
to
the
postal
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
it
falls
squarely
within
the
word
"transmission",
just
exactly
as
an
automobile
accident
arising
out
of
carrying...
transmitting
mail
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
both
equally
within
the
plain
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
happening
in
the...
in
the
truck
when
it
has
an
accident.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
key
word
in
the
statute
is
"transmission",
not
"the
transmission
of
letters
or
postal
matter.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
that's
true,
why
do
you
need
the
words
"miscarried"...
why
do
you
need
the
word
"miscarriage"
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you...
but
so
would
the
word
"transmission"
if
you...
under
your
reading,
you
don't
need
the
word
"miscarriage".
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
question?
the
case
is
a
little
bit
on
the
border,
because
it's
a
slip
and
fall,
and
it
does...
there
may
not
have
been
negligence.
we...
but
we're
assuming,
via
the
allegations,
they're
true.
but
your
position
would
apply
to
an
intentional
tort,
as
well
as
a
negligent
tort,
i
think,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
