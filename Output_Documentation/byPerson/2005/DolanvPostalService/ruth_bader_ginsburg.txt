negligent--

but
an
automobile
accident
is
something,
as
the
government
points
out,
that
any
agency
of
government
can
be
involved
in,
not
peculiar
to
the
postal
service.
but
the
transmission
of
the
letter
is...
the
words
are
"negligent
transmission".
many
people
think
of
the
postal
service,
the
letter
carrier,
delivering
the
mail
to
one's
home.
that
act
surely
fits
the
word
"negligent
transmission".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
is
a
automobile
accident,
and
it...
the
chief
suggested
to
you
that
there
are
other
kinds
of
people
who
deliver
items.
and
that
kind
of
negligence,
you
say,
is
within
the
exception.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
you
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
sorry.
outside
the
exception.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
there,
you're
saying
that
the
post
office
is
just...
it's
just
like
everyone
else
with
respect
to
automobile
accidents,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
and...
you...
therefore,
it
should
be
just
like
everyone
else
with
respect
to
this
negligent
delivery
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
any
sense--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
how
many
claims
of
this
nature
there
are?
i
know
we
do
have
the
second
circuit
case,
on
one
side.
and,
by
the
way,
i
didn't
notice
that
you
refer
to
the
second
circuit
decision
in
your
brief.
did
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--goes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
brief
here...
well,
it's...
it
surprised
me
that
there
were
those
two
cases.
but,
do
you
have
any
notion
of
how
many
slip
and
fall,
trip
over
mail
cases...
claims
are
filed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
concede--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--liability
for
a
slippery
fall
in
the
post
office.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was,
in
one
of
the
briefs,
an
example
where
there's
a
puddle
created
by
the
janitor.
the
post
office
is
liable.
it's...
relates
to
taking
care
of
the
building.
there's
a
parcel
of
mail
that
has
a
liquid
in
it,
and
it's
dropped,
and
the
puddle
is
created
by
the
that.
no
liability.
and
you
agree
that
that
would
be
the
result?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you
agree--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
that
hypothetical--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
correct?
and
there's
another
one
that
they
gave.
the
letter
carrier
comes.
he's
got
a
mailbag
filled
with
mail,
dumps
it
on
the
street
while
he
takes
a
rest,
somebody
trips
over
it.
that's
case
one.
case
two
is,
he's
finished
making
his
rounds,
and
he
dumps
the
sack
on
the
street,
it
has
no
mail
in
it,
and
somebody
trips
over
it.
on
your
theory
of
the
case,
would
there
be
liability
in
both
situations
or
only
in
the
one
where
the
mailbag
was
stuffed
full
of
mail?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
negligence--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--intentional--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--torts
aren't
covered--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--by
it,
are
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
practical
problem
that
was
raised
that,
in
the
automobile
accident,
there's
witnesses,
there's
a
police
report,
usually;
but
a
slip
and
fall
over
mail,
nobody's
around,
these
are
easily
made
up,
and
the
post
office
has
no
opportunity
to
check?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
point
that...
i
think
that
they
were
making
is
that
there
will
be
an
investigation,
on
the
spot,
ordinarily,
in
the
case
of
a
vehicle
collision.
post
office
won't
even
know
about
the
slip
and
fall
until
a
claim
is
filed,
which
could
be
weeks
and
weeks
later.
