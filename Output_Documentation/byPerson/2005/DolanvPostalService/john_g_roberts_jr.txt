chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
today
in
dolan
versus
united
states
postal
service.
mr.
radmore.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how...
wait,
i...
it's
not
true
that
only
mail
can
be
lost,
or
only
mail
can
be
delivered
to
the
wrong
location.
if
you
order
from
a
private
delivery
service,
they
can
do
all
of
those
things,
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
consider
covered
by
negligent
transmission?
i
take
it
if
the...
if
the
postal
worker
throws
the
package
to
the
house
and
there's
something
in
it
that
gets
broken,
that's
covered
by
the
exception?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
if...
now,
if
they
throw
the
package
onto
the
porch,
and
it
lands
in
a
place
where
somebody's
going
to
trip
over
it,
you
say
that's
not
covered
by
the
exception.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
"negligent
transmission"
add
to
"loss"
or
"miscarriage"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
supposed
"miscarriage"
does.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
miscarried,
like
handled
in
a
way
that
it's
damaged,
or
put
in
a
place
where
it's
going
to
be
damaged.
it
seems
to
me
that...
i'm
not
sure
what
additional
weight
"negligent
transmission"
covers
if
you
have
a
reasonable
reading
of
"miscarriage".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that
doesn't
work.
i
mean,
if
you
deliver
it
to
the
house
next
door,
you
haven't
lost
it,
you've
misdelivered
it
or
miscarried
it.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
"miscarriage"
is
redundant.
but
you...
your
construction
of
"negligent
transmission"
is
so
narrow
that
i'm
not
sure
it
adds
anything
to
"miscarriage",
which
suggests
it
might--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
about
"delay"?
does
"delay"...
your...
isn't
that
something
that's
neither
within
"loss"
or
"miscarriage"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
guess...
i...
following
up
on
justice
stevens'
question,
your
theory
with
respect
to
negligent
transmission
is
that
the
postal
service
should
be
liable
in
the
same
way
that
private
parties
are.
but
that
theory
doesn't
hold
up
when
you're
talk...
that's
not
your
theory.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then,
what
is
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
would
have
thought
that
was
miscarriage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
loss.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
only
superfluous
under
your
reading.
if
it
covers,
for
example,
putting
the
package...
negligently
placing
the
package
in
a
location
where
it's
going
to
cause
injury,
well,
then
it's
not
superfluous.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
just...
it
wouldn't
make
it
superfluous
at
all.
"loss"
would
cover
loss.
"miscarriage"
would
cover
damage.
and
"negligent
transmission"
would
be
transmitting
it
negligently,
such
as
leaving
it
where
somebody's
going
to
trip
over
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
radmore.
ms.
millet.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
if
it's
for--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
are
you
talking
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you're
talking
about
letters,
though,
right?
i
mean,
i...
they...
is
fedex
and
ups
in
the
neighborhood
when
you're
talking
about
packages--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--of
the
size
that
have
to
be
left--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--on
the
porch?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what's
the
postal
service
number
for
large
packages?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
if
the
postman
throws
the
box
onto
the
porch
and
hits
somebody
there,
you
say
that's
within
the
exception?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
say,
"hey,
you
hit
me
with
the
mail.
"
right?
you
say,
"you
hit
me
with
a
box.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
claim--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--arises
out
of
how
he
handled
the
box,
just
like--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
the
other
case
it
arises
out
of
how
he
handled
the
vehicle.
you
don't
care
whether
it's
the
mail
or
not.
by
the
same
token,
when
you
trip
over
something...
a
box...
you
don't
care
whether
it's
a
mail
box
or
if
it's
the
box
from
ups.
and
yet,
in
your
case,
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--defense
affects
the
process.
in
other
words,
you
would,
more
and
more,
be
leaving
those...
the
little
slips
of
paper
saying,
"go
down
to
the
post
office
and
pick
up
your
package.
"
rather
than
leaving
the
package
on
the
porch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
radmore,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
any...
i
mean,
you'll
be
responsible,
if
you
prevail,
for
all
of
us
having
to
go
down
to
the
post
office
every
time
we
get--
[laughter]
--packages.
i
mean,
it
there--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--do
you
have
any
response
to
that
policy
concern?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
the
volume
is
unique.
in
other
words,
there
aren't
going
to,
in
a
typical
case,
be
a
lot
of
witnesses,
and
the
volume
is
unique.
and
you
can't
bring
the
postal
carrier
in,
two
years
after
the
fact,
and
say,
"do
you
remember
where
you
placed
this
parcel
on
this
porch
on
this
day?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
in
no.
