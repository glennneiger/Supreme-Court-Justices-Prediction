mr.
james
r.
radmore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
federal
tort
claims
act's
postal
matter
exception
bars
any
claim
arising
out
of
the
failure
of
the
postal
service
to
fulfill
its
duty
to
deliver
mail
to
its
intended
destination
on
time
and
in
good
condition,
but
does
not
bar
any
claim
arising
out
of
ordinary
negligence
that
happens
to
occur
while
the
tortfeasor
is
delivering
mail.
the
petitioner's
construction
shields
the
government
from
all
claims
arising
out
of
loss
or
damage
or
delay
or
destruction
of
the
mail,
while
allowing
claims
that
do
not
stem
from
all...
do
not
stem
from
the
violation
of
the
unique
duty
of
the
postal
service
to
make
sure
that
the
mail
arrives
on
time
and
in
good
condition.
it
is
the
construction
most
faithful
with
the
text
and
purpose
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
exception
bars
any
claims,
whether
for
personal
injury
or
property
damage,
that
arise
while
the
mail
is...
if
the
mail
is
lost,
misdelivered,
damaged,
or
delayed.
the
government
argues
for
a
much
broader
construction
that
would
bar
all
claims
that
arise
from
the
handling
of
mail.
the
government's
construction
depends
on
a
definition
of
transmission
of
the
mail,
viewed
in
isolation
from
the
rest--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--well,
the--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--justice
o'connor,
this
court's
decision
in
kosak
tells
us
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
in
enacting
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
to
allow
private
persons
to
be
able
to
make
claims
against
the
postal
service
from
motor
vehicle--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--accidents.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
correct.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
well,
once
you--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--but
once
there's
a
broad
waiver--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--well--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--well,
the
exception...
this
court
has
told
us,
in
both
smith
and
kosak,
that
it
is
the...
the
lower
courts
and
this
court,
when
they're
viewing
an
exception
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act...
that
they
shouldn't
extend
the
waiver,
nor
should
they
view
it
more
narrowly,
that
they
should
look
at
the
waiver...
they
should
look
at
the
exception
and
make
a
determination
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
the
words
are,
and
what
the
reason
for
the
exception
was,
and
they
should
do
no
more,
nor
no
less,
than
that.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
well,
that's
exactly
what
the
point...
that
our
point
is,
is
that,
because
the
government,
in
this
case
in...
and
the
court,
in
kosak,
has
told
us
that
automobile
accidents
are
not
barred,
are...
from...
by...
they're
not
barred--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--in
the
case--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--negligent--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--negligent--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--transmission.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
justice
ginsburg,
in
isolation,
we
admit
that
the
word
"transmission"
could
have
the
broad
interpretation
that
the
government
as...
is
urging
this
court
to
follow.
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
term
"negligent
transmission"
in
the
context
of
the
whole
exception.
and
if
"negligent
transmission"
were
to
be
given
the
broad
interpretation
that
the
government
urges
and
the
third
circuit
found,
then
the
words
"loss"
and
"miscarriage"
in
the
exception
would
be
superfluous.
and
we
also
know
that
this
court,
on
prior
occasions,
has
indicated
that
the
canon
that
"words
are
known
by
their
associate.
"
applies
in
construing
exceptions
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
and
in...
that
canon
tells
us
that
when
you
have
words
that
are
in
a
group,
they
should
be
given
like
meaning.
and
we
know
that
only
mail
can
be
lost,
only
mail
can
be
delivered
to
the
wrong
location.
and,
as
a
result,
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
term
"negligent
transmission"
deals
with
the
mail,
itself.
and--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--well,
they
can
do
all
those
things,
but
they
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the...
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
any
damage
to
the
mail,
itself,
would
be
covered
to
the
exception...
by
the
exception.
for
instance,
if
a...
if
somebody
had
ordered
their
medication
over
the...
you
know,
through
the
medicare
act,
and
they
had
ordered
it
from
a
warehouse
somewhere
in
idaho,
and
the...
during
the
transmission
of
the
mail,
the
medication
had
been
lost,
well,
if
somebody
was
injured,
if
they
had
a
stroke
or
they
had
a
heart
attack
because
they
didn't
get
their
mail
on
time--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--that's
not
covered,
because
that's
an
act
of
ordinary
negligence.
damage
to
the
package
would
always
be
covered,
but
the
act
of
creating
a
hazardous
condition
would
not
be
covered,
because
that's
an
ordinary
tort
that
would
be...
subject
private
persons
to
a
liability
between
themselves.
and
that's...
the
purpose
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
to
allow
the
government
to
be
held
responsible
for
ordinary
torts
if
there
would
be
a
like
liability
between
private
persons.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
it
would
cover
late
deliveries.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
it
would...
could.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
delay
or
damage--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--to
the--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
i--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--justice--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--scalia,
that's
correct,
that
the
exception
would
bar
suit
against
the
government
for
any
damage
to
the
actual
contents
of
the
package,
itself.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
well,
it's
not
really
the
same
act.
it's
the
same
act,
in
that
they
used
the
mail,
and
there
was
a
consequence
to
the
mail,
but
the
creation
of
a
hazard
or...
through
some
kind
of
careless
act,
whether
it
be
the
postal
employee
or
whether
it
be
a
person
that
would
raise
2680(c)
from
the
customs
exception,
whether...
or
an
irs
agent
or
a
private
person--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--would
all
be
responsible
for
creating
a
hazardous
condition
on
the
porch.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
precisely
the
same
under
our
interpretation
of--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--well,
the...
"loss"
doesn't
cover
mail
that
would
be
delayed
or
damaged.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
"miscarriage"
would
be
mail
that
went
to
the
wrong
location.
if
it
was
misdelivered,
that's
what
"miscarriage"
would
mean
in
this
context.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
well,
you
could
look
at
every
term
in
the
exception,
and,
if
you
gave
it
the
broadest
definition
possible,
you
could
say
that
all
of
the
words
are
superfluous,
that
"loss"
would
cover
mail
that
was,
you
know,
lost
and
not
delivered
to
the
postal
patron
within
two
weeks,
and,
for
that
period
of
time,
the
mail
was
lost.
but
if
you
look
at
the
exception
in--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--well,
"miscarriage"
doesn't
mean
that
the
mail
was
damaged.
mr.
justice
roberts,
to
your
next
door
neighbor,
it
doesn't
mean
the
mail
is...
maybe
miscarriaged,
but
it's
not
delayed,
and
it's
not
damaged.
so--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--no,
"delayed"
wouldn't
be
within
either
term.
"lost",
i
think,
means
exactly
what
it
says,
mail
that's
lost.
"lost"
means
lost.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
you
couldn't
sue.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
i
have
that
same
problem.
[laughter]
it--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--well,
obviously,
a
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
well,
i
think
anything...
any
claim
that
would
arise
from
the
unique
governmental
duty
to
deliver
the
mail
on
time
and
in
good
condition
would
be
barred.
any--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--oh,
no,
it
wouldn't
be
barred,
because
that's
an
ordinary
tort.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
but
the
mail...
in
that
hypothetical,
the
mail
still
arrived
on
time
and
in
good
condition
if
they
bopped
somebody
on
the
head.
there
wouldn't
be
a
bar--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--but
they
don't
have
a
duty.
the
difference
is,
in
that
case,
if
a...
if
a
private
person
were
to
go
and
open
up
the
package,
or
if
a
private
person
were
to
take
your
letter
that
showed
that
you
had
an
inheritance,
a
private
person
doesn't
have
the
duty.
only
the
government
has
a
duty
to
deliver
the
mail
on
time
and
in
good
condition.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
well,
it's
not
good
condition
for
purposes
of
ordinary
torts.
the
exception
bars
a
claim
against
the
government
for
the
contents
of
the
package.
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
if
the
toupee
were
damaged
as
a
result
of
the
package
being
opened,
then
you
could
not
make
a
claim,
because
that
was
the
content
of
the
mail,
but
if
you
fell
over
the
package,
that's
an
ordinary
tort,
that's
a
common
duty
between
private
persons.
so--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--understand
your--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--question,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
correct.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
with
respect
to
ordinary
torts.
if
they
create...
if
the
post
office
creates
a
hazardous
condition,
then
they
should
be
a...
responsible,
just
as
private
persons
are.
we
know
that
that's
the
purpose
of
the
broad
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
is
to
make
the
government...
or
to
allow
private
persons
to
make
a
claim
against
the
government
if
there
is
a
duty
that
is
common
to
private
persons.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
stevens.
and
i
believe
that
that's
really
the
biggest
problem
the
government
has
with
their
interpretation
of
negligent
transmission,
because
if
there's
an
exclusion
for
motor
vehicle
accidents,
then
that
would
mean
that
that
exclusion
would
not
only
apply
to
the
terms
of
the
exception
10,000
irs
refund
checks
on
it,
and
that
tractor
trailer
is
in
a
accident,
and
all
of
the
refund
checks
are
destroyed,
well,
any
private
person
who
didn't
get
their
refund
check
in
time,
and
couldn't
pay
their
mortgage,
or
they
couldn't
pay
for
their
credit
card
bill
or
they
couldn't
do
something
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
those
refund
checks,
would
be
able
to
make
a
claim
against
the
government,
as
long
as
the
loss
occurred
from
a
motor
vehicle
accident.
they
make
no
explanation
as
to
why
that
would
not
be
the
case.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
no,
i--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--oh,
not
at
all.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
if
the...
any...
anytime
that
the
mail
is
lost,
the
mail
is
delivered
to
the
wrong
location,
the
mail
is
damaged
or--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--delayed--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--through
negligence,
regardless
if
it's
a
motor
vehicle
accident,
then
the
government
is
protected.
and
so,
it's--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--that's
not--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--our
theory
is,
if
there's
damage
to
the
mail,
there's
an
exception
to--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--some--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--damage?
mr.
james
r.
radmore
well,
if
it
was...
if
it
was
the
same
as
miscarriage
or
loss,
then
that
makes
the
whole
term
"negligent
transmission"
superfluous.
and
this
court
has
told
us
that
every
term
in
an...
in
the...
any
exception
should
be
viewed
so
as--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--well,
in
a
broad...
that's
true
if
you're
going
to
read
the
words
so
broadly
that...
it
would
then
make
"loss"
and
"miscarriage"
superfluous.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
but
the
broad
interpretation
that
the
government
asks
for,
and
that
the
third
circuit
followed,
was
that
"negligent
transmission"
covered
anything
that
occurred
to
the
mail
from
the
time
the
mail
was
dropped
off
at
the
post
office
until
it
arrived
at
a
third...
to
the
third
person.
so,
with
that
broad
definition
of
"negligent
transmission",
anything
that
occurred,
whether
it
was
a
loss
of
the
mail,
whether
it
was
misdelivered
to
the
wrong
location,
would
be
covered,
and
that
would
make
the
words
"loss"
and
"miscarriage"
superfluous.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
there
would
be
a
bar.
the
bar
would
apply.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
that's
more,
rather--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--than
less.
that's
exactly
where
we
think--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--well,
it
also
would
protect
the
government
when
there
is
a...
either
a
personal
injury
or
some
kind
of
loss,
a
personal
injury
or
an
economic
loss
that
arises
from
the
damage
or
delay
to
the
mail.
you
know,
i
think
i
brought
up
the
example
of
the
medication
or
if...
if
you
had
a
check
or
a
coupon
bond
that
was
destroyed.
there
would--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
yes,
justice
souter,
exactly.
and
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
just
one
point.
the
choice
of
what
to
take
into
the
mail
would
be
covered
by
the
discretionary
function
exception
of
the
exceptions
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
so,
i
think
that's
a
red
herring.
and
with
that,
if
there's
no
questions,
the
petitioner
will
waive
the
remainder
of
his
rebuttal.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
the
post
office
has
every
opportunity,
just
as
in
any
ordinary
tort.
all
the
defenses
apply.
in
this
particular
case,
the
post
office...
and
it's
been
alluded
to
by
several
justices...
would
be
that
they
have
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence.
they
would
have
any
defense
that
would
be
available--
mr.
james
r.
radmore
--but
that's...
that's
the
situation
in
any
tort.
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
police
report,
necessarily,
in
an
automobile
accident.
and
in
a...
any
slip
and
fall
or
any
tort,
beyond
the
motor
vehicle
accident,
it's
the
same
situation.
it's
not
unique
to
the
post
office.
mr.
james
r.
radmore
that's
what
you'd
have
to
do
to
a
ups
or
a
federal
express
employee.
and
i
believe
solicitor
general's
response
to
justice
ginsburg
question
about
the
number
of
claims
that
you
have
a
year...
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
said
situations
like
this
arise
ten
times
a
year.
and
the
postal...
the
post
office's
own
handbook
dealing
with
the
handling
of
negligence
cases
sets
forth
procedures
and
policies
that
deal
exactly
with
this
type
of
circumstance.
if
we
were
to
look
at
the
handbook...
i
think,
justice
kennedy
referred
to
the
handbook,
and
that
section
141
of
the
postal
investigation
handbook
talks
about
claims
that
arise
for
personal
injury
or
property
damage
during
the
delivery
of
the
mail.
so,
at
least
since...
and
that's
been...
that
was
put
in
place
in
1992,
so
we
at
least
know,
for
the
last
13
years,
that
they've
anticipated
these
type
of
claims.
and,
according
to
the
government,
there's
only
been
ten
a
year.
so,
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
real
concern
by
the
post
office
that
there's
going
to
be
some...
a
floodgate
of
litigation
opened
up.
