justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if,
in
fact,
they...
the
post
office
negligently
delays
the
knowledge
that
would
come
to
me
in
the
letter,
that
i
have
15
days
to
claim
my
billion
dollar
inheritance--
[laughter]
--i
guess
i
couldn't
sue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
suppose
what
they
do
is...
this
is...
it
seems
to
me
this
case
is
like
a
first
year
law
school
hypothetical.
but,
i
mean,
the...
suppose
that
the...
what
they
do
is,
he
puts
the
mail
on
the
porch,
my
package,
and
he
rips
it
open,
negligently;
and
there
for
everyone
to
see
is
the
toupee
that
i
ordered.
[laughter]
and
i
sue...
i
sue
for
public
humiliation.
see?
i
mean,
what
about
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
what
i...
to
sort
of
my
cards
on
the...
i
was
thinking,
"well,
that
comes
close",
but
maybe
it...
maybe
it
is
within
the...
within
the...
within
the
exception.
i'm
not
sure.
and
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
the
other--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
the
other...
no,
they...
see,
it...
he
put
it
on
the
porch,
which
is
transmitting
it,
in
such
a
way
that
it
fell
open.
but
i'm
just
trying
to
think...
and
then
the...
on
the
other
side
of
it,
you
have
the
automobile
accident.
and
i
guess
he
comes
along
the
street,
the
postman,
swinging
my
package
around,
and
bops
someone
on
the
head
with
it.
i
guess
that's
covered.
and
then,
this
case
is
somewhere
in
the
middle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what's
the
principle
according
to
which
we're
drawing
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
ordinary
tort
doesn't
quite
work,
because
i
guess
my
public
humiliation
case
is...
could
be
an
ordinary
tort.
somebody
could
go
up
to
the
porch
and
rip
it
open,
nothing
to
do
with
the
mail.
and,
moreover,
somebody
could,
in
fact,
delay
the
transmission
of
my
inheritance.
see?
they
could.
so,
all
those
things
could
be
ordinary
torts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
it
have
a...
in
good
condition.
therefore,
when
they
put
it...
therefore,
i
guess,
ripping
it
open
is,
in
fact,
not
in
good
condition,
so
maybe
that
is
immune.
and
leaving
it
on
the
porch
in
a
position
where
somebody
would
trip
over
it,
you
might
say
they
didn't
deliver
it
in
good
condition,
because
what
they're
supposed
to
do
is
place
it
somewhere
where
you
don't
trip
over
it.
and
that's
good
condition
for
the
delivery.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
how
does
it
hurt
you,
say,
in
the
live
alligator,
et
cetera,
case?
if
the
court
says...
well,
anything
that's
special
in
respect
to
transmission
of
live
alligators,
because
it's
the
mail,
et
cetera,
delayed...
or
i...
i
don't
know
how
else
you'd
get
a
tort
out
of
it.
but
if
it's
simply
the
kind
of
thing
that
anyone
could
do,
like
driving
a
postal
truck
or
leaving
something
on
a
porch
that
somebody
trips
over
or
walking
along
the
street
swinging
the
live
alligator
over
your
head,
or
whatever
you
do--
[laughter]
--that
kind
of
thing
that
anybody
does
just
coincidence
its
the
postman
whose
doing
it...
that
kind
of
thing
doesn't
mean
to
fall
within
the
"transmission".
now,
suppose
that
that
was
the
holding.
how
would
the
government
be
hurt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
we'd
look
to
is,
you'd
look
to
the
purpose
of
this.
the
purpose
of
it
was,
basically,
i
gather
from
the
history,
as
recounted
in
kosak...
in
what
the
court
said
in
kosak...
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
try
to
bring
back
into
sovereign
immunity,
so
you're
not
sued
all
the
time,
the
very
kind
of
common
suit
that
a
person
could
protect
himself
for
the
loss
by
registering
the
package,
by
taking
out
this
ordinary
transmission
insurance,
which
is
not
that
hard
to
do.
so,
they
said,
if
we
start
opening
it
up
to
misdelivery
claims,
all
that
pack...
family
of
things,
everybody'll
say,
"hey,
you
hurt
my
pet,
you
didn't
give
me
the
check.
"
i
mean,
all
kinds
of
things
will
be
opened
up.
but
the
government's
already
liable
for
what
i'd
call
the
"swinging
the
package
around",
leaving
it...
slip
and
fall,
trucks.
so
that
falls
on
the
other
side.
now,
how
does
that
hurt
you,
the
government,
if
that's
how
we'd
come
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
can't
get
too
far--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--with
the
text.
i
think
you
have
a
great
claim,
and
so
does
the
other
side;
but
if
it's
just
the
text,
that's
not
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is,
if
i
think
the
text
is
perfectly
ambiguous
on
this,
i
look
to
the
purpose,
suppose
i
came
out
the
way
i
just
said.
how
would
the
government
be
hurt?
is
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
fact,
you
have
a
driver
of
the
truck,
the
postal
truck,
and
what
he
does
is,
he
puts
the
mail
in
the
truck,
so
my
skis,
which
i
have
shipped
by
mail,
happen
to
stick
out
the
side,
and,
as
he
walk...
drives
along,
he
just
mows
down
the
pedestrians.
[laughter]
i
take
it,
on
your
theory,
that
that...
there
is
no
lawsuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
are...
you
got
the...
well,
that's
exactly
the
point
i'd
like
you
to
hone
in
on,
because
i
don't
see
what's...
you
say,
"well,
we're
defenseless".
why
are
you
more
defenseless
than
any
other
business
that
leaves
things
on
porches?
that
might
be,
you
know,
482
million
apple
deliverers
or
domino
pizza
people.
i
don't
know.
or
they...
they
ring
the
bell,
probably,
but
some...
mcdonald's
hamburgers,
lots
of...
department
stores.
i
mean,
a
lot
of
people
leave
things
on
porches.
so,
why
are
you
more
defenseless
than
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
people
are
likely
to
trip
over.
i
mean,
they're
not
likely
to
trip
over
a
letter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about...
but
i'm
surprised
that
there's
no
empirical
examples
of
what...
well,
i
would
think
it
would
have
happened,
in
50
years
and
tens
of
millions
of
packages,
that
a
package
falls
off
a
truck.
you
know,
the
next
driver
veers
somewhere
and
gets
into
an
accident,
and
they
say
it
was
the...
it
wasn't
packed
properly.
i
think
should
have
happened
sometime
in
the
post
service
over...
postal
service
over
50
year.
my
guess
is,
it
did
happen
and
you
just
paid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
we
actually
know,
either
of
us?
i
don't,
i
confess.
do
you...
do
you--
