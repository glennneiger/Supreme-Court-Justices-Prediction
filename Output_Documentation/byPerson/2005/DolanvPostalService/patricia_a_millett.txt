ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
justice
o'connor,
when
you
mentioned
that
this
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
we
have
to
construe
that
with
that
in
mind,
it's,
sort
of,
central
to
our
starting
to
our
point
for
understanding
this
statute.
this
claim
falls
squarely
within
the
text
of
the
statutory
exception,
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
much
dispute
about
that.
and
the
question
is
whether--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
falls
with--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
falls
within
the
word
"transmission",
but
the
relevant
phrase
is
"negligent
transmission
of
mail
or
postal
matter.
"
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but
what
you're
suing
over
in
that
case...
and
this
is
exactly
the
line
this
court
drew
in
kosak...
your
claim
isn't...
it
has
to
arise
out
of
the
negligent
transmission
of
mail.
your
claim,
when
the...
when
the
delivery
truck
or
the
postal
truck
rear
ends
you,
doesn't
arise
out
of
the
handling
of
the
mail;
it
arises
out
of
the
handling
of
the
vehicle.
there's
two
activities
going
on
at
the
same
time,
and
you're
suing
about
the
one,
and
not
the
other.
and
i
think
it's
a...
it's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think,
at
that
point,
sort
of,
the
crate
and
the
mail
have
become
one
thing,
as
if
he
left
it
in
a
bag
or
he...
they
put
a
plastic
bag
around
it
to
protect
it
from
the
rain,
and
technically
you
would
trip
over
the
plastic
bag,
but
it's
the
lump
of
mail
that
you're
tripping
over.
i
mean,
if
the
crate
had
some
bar
sticking
out,
and
all
you
tripped
over
was
the
bar
and
not
the
mail,
then
that
might
be
a
different
case.
but
i
do
think
that
we
have
to
look
carefully
at
whether
it
arises
out
of
the
handling
of
the
mail.
and
that
is
a
distinction
that
protects
the
activity
that
the
postal
service
is
engaged
in
that
congress
wanted
to
protect,
the
handling
of
the
mail.
it's
a...
it's
a
protection
for
the
post,
but
it--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
key
words,
i
think,
are
the
whole
exception,
which
is
"arising
out
of
the
negligent
transmission
of
mail.
"
it's
not
"negligent
activities
of
the
postal
service.
"
the
text
focuses...
it's
a
protection
for
the
post,
not
the
postal
service.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
just
as
if
you're--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
"miscarriage"
captures
delivery
to
the
wrong
person,
which
doesn't
harm
the
mail,
itself.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
what...
"transmission"
adds
a
lot...
i
think
if
you
look,
sort
of,
sequentially,
the
way
congress
was
thinking...
and
it
may
not
have
been
at,
sort
of,
this
level...
but
"loss"
is
mail
that
doesn't
go
anywhere,
it
doesn't
get
there.
"miscarriage"
gets
to
the
wrong
person.
"transmission"
gets
to
the
right
person,
but
something
went
wrong
in
the
process.
and
so,
if
you
look
at
it
that
way,
yes,
there's
no
doubt
there's
overlap,
but
"transmission"
captures
a
lot
more
than
just
"miscarriage".
it
is
important
to
understand
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
covers--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
covers
damage.
it
covers--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--absolutely.
and
the
same
delay
may,
or
not,
be
with
them.
but
the
other
thing
that
petitioner's
theory
doesn't
capture...
they're
two
very
important
things.
one
is
the
decision
to
admit
things
to
the
mail
in
the
first
place.
if
it
ends
up
being
a
letterbomb
or,
unfortunately,
anthrax,
or
biohazards...
i
mean,
we
ship
poisons,
we
ship
medical
specimens,
we
ship
live
alligators.
i
mean,
every...
you
wouldn't
believe
what
goes
into
the
mail.
[laughter]
and
there
has
to
be
some
protection
for
that
decision
to
admit
things
into
the
mail
in
the
first
place.
the
other
thing
it
doesn't
capture
is
the
very
important
decisions
that
post...
the
post
office
has
to
make
about
getting
the
mail
to
someone
on
time.
part
of
that
is
how
i
get
it
there.
and
it's...
it
includes
not
just
how
i
get
the
millions
of
packages
every
day
that
don't
fit
in
a
mailbox
or
a
mail
slot
to
their
customers;
it
includes
how,
after
a
hurricane,
we
decide
to
deliver
mail
outside
the
superdome
or
to
people
whose
mailboxes
have
been
blown
off
of
their
houses.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
first
of
all,
that...
if
the...
if
the
exception,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
of
harms
to
or
from
the
content
of
the
mail,
that
isn't
going
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
hurts
us...
i
mean,
my
starting
point,
first
of
all,
is
this
text,
and
not
legislative
history
or
purpose--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--which
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--okay.
but
i--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--what
the
government
is
hurt
by
is
the
fact
that
you're...
some...
you're
allowing
torts
for
the
one
activity
that
is
distinct
to
the
postal
service
amongst
governmental
agencies,
and
that
is
the
act
of
delivering.
that
is
what
the
transmission
exception
protects.
when
you're...
when
you're
driving
a
vehicle,
the
postal
employee
is
making
the...
is
not
making
mail
specific
judgments.
the
postal
employee
is
making
the
same
judgments
that
i
made
driving
to
work
today
and
that
everyone
else
on
the
road
makes.
but
when
you
are
making
decisions
about
how
to
deliver
660
million
pieces
of
mail
a
day
to
142
million
different
locations...
the
bottom
of
the
grand
canyon,
remote
alaska,
and
urban
cities...
that...
to
get
that
job
done,
you
have
to
be
able
to
make
judgments
about
the
actual
act
of
delivery.
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
but
it's
clear
that
congress
wanted
to
capture
negligence.
i
mean,
it's
the...
it...
the
fact
that...
there
has
to
be
an
analog
to
private
people,
or
we're
not
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
land
anyhow.
the
question
is,
which
of
those
activities?
and
the
text
focuses
on--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
actual--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it...
whether
or
not
it's
unique,
congress
focused
on
the
presence
of
mail
in
a
mail
specific
judgment.
that's
how
we
read--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
text--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
mail--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--first
of
all,
the
decision
to
put
it
into
a
mailbox
is
a
uniquely
postal--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--drive
the...
driving
is
not
unique
to
the
mail.
it's
not,
even
amongst
agencies,
let
alone
amongst
private
parties.
the...
what--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and
it--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
doesn't--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
doesn't
have
to
be
unique
to
mail.
if
it
is
unique
to
mail,
if
there's
no
private
party
analog,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
doesn't
apply,
by
its
own
terms.
but
what...
i
mean,
there
is
a
distinct
and
unique
postal
act
of
putting
things
into
the
mailbox.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
if
it--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
if
your
damage...
harms
to
and
from
the
mail,
yes.
yes,
that
is
our
position.
if
he
mows
'em
down
with
his
arm
or
with
his
rearview
mirror
on
his
truck,
your...
the
liability
attaches.
but
you
asked
why
it
is
important,
justice
breyer.
and
one
of
the
reasons
it's
very
important
is
to
look
at
these
types
of
claims.
the
postal
service
is
defenseless.
we
are
essentially
defenseless
when
we
get
one
of
these
claims.
unlike
a
vehicle
accident,
where
we
are
a
party
to
it
and
know
what
happens
when
it
happens,
this
type
of
injury,
we
may
not
know
about
for
up
to
two
years
after--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
happens.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i'd--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--uh
huh.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i'm
not
going
to
say
here
that
we
wouldn't
have
some
defenses
that
me
may
want
to
invoke
at
a
future
time,
but
i'm
not
very
optimistic,
because
i
think
the
fact
that
you...
they
may
not
have
a
box
doesn't
mean
that
we
could
put
it...
assuming
your
theory
that
we're
liable...
put
it
somewhere
negligently--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--as
opposed--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--nonnegligently.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
mean,
i
think
they
make
the...
as
a
practical...
is
there
text
in
the
domestic
mail
manual
that
specifically
says,
"put
it
where
somebody
won't
slip?
"
no.
i
think
it's
the
same
judgment
that's
being
made.
they're
making
the
best
judgments
that
they
can,
but
there
is...
you
know,
they're,
sort
of,
caught
between
them.
so,
they
need
to
put
it
somewhere
where
it's
sheltered,
and
that
tends
to
be
close
up
to
buildings.
and
the
problem
is,
it's
not--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--once
it's
on
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
except--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
except...
it
is
different...
the
exception
applies
whether
we
do
it
negligently
or
nonnegligently.
and
so,
the
fact
that
we
didn't
happen
to
do
it,
at
least
allegedly,
negligently
in
this
case
isn't
what...
can't
be
what
triggers
the
exception.
and
what
is
different
is,
you...
understanding,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
the
postal
carriers
are
supposed
to
do
millions
of
times
every
day
when
the
mail
doesn't
fit--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--because...
because
we...
first
of
all,
we
leave
it
there
for
37
cents,
and
we
leave
it
in
a
volume...
660
million
pieces
of...
a
day.
fedex
and
ups
aren't
even
in
the
neighborhood--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--of
that
amount.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
we--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--660
million
includes
letters
and
packages.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
ups
does,
i
think,
about
12
million
a
day;
fedex,
about
5
million.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
large?
i
mean,
they...
they
don't
count
it
by
large--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--medium,
or
what
will
fit
inside
the
mailbags.
i
simply
can't
give
you
a
number--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--on
that.
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--a
number
of
letters
bundled...
i
wouldn't...
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
to
see
what
could
happen
if,
in
fact,
the
liability
is
allowed.
if
you're...
you
know,
you
go
to
put
it
into
the
mailbox,
and
a
piece
slips
out
of
the
mailman's
hand
and
lands
on
the
porch,
and
it's
one
of
those
cellophane
envelopes,
and
it's
slippery.
i
mean,
that's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--maybe
all
that
it
takes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--don't
remember.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
know
it
was
in
our
brief
in
opposition,
but
i
don't
recall
if
i
did
in
this.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
can
give
you
a
rough
estimate.
there
are...
there
are
700...
about
700
slip
and
fall
cases
a
year,
but
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
those
are
slipping
in
a
building
on,
you
know,
a
slippery
floor,
which
we
concede
liability
for.
probably,
you
know...
less
than
a
dozen,
around
ten
or
so
a
year,
thus
far.
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--we've
been
able
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes.
we--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--concede
liability
for
that,
because
that...
just
like...
that's
not
handling
of
the
mail,
that's
handling
of
a
building
or
handling
of
a
vehicle,
which
we
see
different
from
handling
of--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
mail.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
if
we
break...
if
we
break...
whatever
damage
is
done
to
the
mail,
and
the
package
in
the
mail,
the
liquid
in
the
mail
cannot
be
sued
over.
that
is...
and
i
think
petitioners
agree...
damage
to
and
from
the
mail--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--is
our
conception.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
if
you're
tripping
over
mail,
and
the
mail
bag
has
mail
in
it,
there's
no
liability.
you're
harmed
from
the
mail.
if
it's
from
mail
apparatus
or,
you
know,
a
postal
employee's
leg
sticking
out
while
they're
sleeping,
then
we
will
admit
liability
for
that.
the
focus...
our
view
of
the
focus
of
this
exception,
i
think,
by
its
text...
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
kosak...
is
on
the
handling
of
the
mail,
and
that
is
a
very
important
line
for
the
postal
service.
they
have
to
make
hard
judgments--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think...
in...
first
of
all,
it's
just
dicta
in
kosak,
which,
in
fact,
construed
the
customs
exception
to
include
both...
you
know,
not
to
turn
upon
the
type
of
damage
that
ensued,
so
we
actually
are
asking
for
the
sort
of
same
analysis
of
the
holding
in
kosak...
the
dicta
in
kosak
about
motor
vehicles
is
different...
i
think
if
i
could
just...
for
the
logical
reason,
if
someone
rear
ends
you,
you
don't--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--uh
huh.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
agree,
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
holding--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and
that
language
has
to
be
read
against
the
backdrop
of
the
holding
of
kosak,
which
recognized
that
when
you
have
exceptions
that
are
written
in
these
broad
terms,
the
form
of
the
injury,
the
particular
type
of
personal
injury...
there,
it
was
property
injury...
that
ensues
doesn't
change
whether
the
exception
applies.
motor
vehicles
are
different.
if
you're
rear
ended
by
a
truck,
you
don't
jump
out
and
say,
"hey,
you
negligently
transmitted
the
mail.
"
you
say...
you
jump
out
and
you
say,
"you
didn't...
your
brake
lights
weren't
working.
"
"you
didn't
signal".
those
are...
there
are
not
judgments
about
the
handling
of
the
mail
being
made
that
the
claim
arises
out
of.
you're
not
suing
about
how
we
handled
the
mail;
you're
suing
about
how
we
handled
motor
vehicles.
yes,
at--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--30,000
feet,
it's
all--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes,
that's...
if
we--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--your
claim
arises
out
of
how
we
handled
the
mail,
not
how
handled
a
vehicle,
not
how
we
handled
a
building,
not
how
we
handled--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--mail
apparatus.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
if...
i
thought
the
box
was
the
mail,
itself,
that
you're
throwing--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--out
of...
and
if
the
box...
but
your
injury
arises...
if
it's
to
or
from
the
mail--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it's
within
the
exception.
and,
yes,
there
are
fine
lines,
as
with
any
of
these
distinctions.
in
practice...
in
practice...
for
the
practical
reason
that
you
don't
have
the
sheer
volume
of
claims,
against
which
the
postal
service
is
largely
defenseless,
that
you
have
when
you
start
talking--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--about
delivering--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
that's
exactly
right.
and
it's
hard
to...
i
mean,
that
is...
you
know,
what
happens
here
when
i
show
up
with
oversized
mail,
as
a
mail
carrier?
i've
got
the
choice
of
delaying
your
receipt
of
the
mail
by
taking
it
back
to
the
postal
service,
inconveniencing
you,
making
you
come
downtown.
that
act
is
within
the
exception.
i
can
try
a
person
to
person
delivery.
but
the
postal
service
went
away
from
that,
for
logical
reasons,
because
that
will
delay
everybody
else's
mail,
and
there's
no
liability
for
all
of
those
delays.
if
you
set
this
same
package
down,
and
it
has
medicine
or
food
in
it...
it
says...
marked
"perishable"
on
the
outside...
it's
in
the
sun,
it
goes
rotten,
the
person
gets
sick,
there's
no
liability.
but
the...
this
is
a
protection
for
an
activity
of
the
government,
like
the...
many
of
the
other
federal
tort
claim
act
exceptions.
and
the
protection
for
that
activity
is
an
upfront
protection
that
doesn't
turn
on
the
happenstance
of
which
particular
form
of
injury
is
manifested
at...
hours
later.
and
it's
an
important
reason,
as
i
said,
not
only
for
the
sheer
volume
of
claims
that
we
could
face
if
this
is
opened
up
on
how
we
deliver,
but
all...
our
inability
to
defend,
when,
two
years
later,
we
simply
do
not...
unlike
fedex
or
ups,
or
probably
the
pizza
delivery,
we
can't
recreate,
months
later,
how
we
delivered
the
mail--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--unless
it's
registered.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
and,
as
we
chronicle
at
length
in
our
brief,
both
through
history
and
contemporaneously,
the
use
of
the
word
"transmit"
and
"transmission"
in
postal
services
is
commonplace,
and
it
means
delivery
to...
it
means
getting
something
to
the
person.
congress
has
consistently
used
"transmission"
that
way.
and
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
bring
you
back
to
is,
understand
that
the
reason
the
vehicle
distinction
worked...
one
of
the
reasons
congress
would
have
expected
that
is,
that
had
happened
before
in
history.
we
show,
again
in
our
brief,
a
number
of
cases.
for
a
long
time,
there
have
been
distinctions
between
allowing
liability
for...
and
back
then,
it
was
stagecoach
drivers
that
drove
too
fast
through
town.
and
those
cases
were
held...
you
know,
when
you...
when
you
held
someone
liable
for
driving
too
fast
through
town,
that
was
held
not
to
be
a
stoppage
of
the
mail,
stoppage
of
the
transmission
of
the
mail.
but
when
you
tried
to
regulate,
more
fundamentally,
how
the
postal
service
decided
to
do
its
deliveries,
and
whom
it
would
authorize
to
undertake
the
delivery,
that
was
held
to
interfere
with
the
mails.
and
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--my
guess
is
that
we
did
not
pay,
because
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--would
be
an
injury
rising--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--to
and
from
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
don't,
off
the
top
of
my
head,
but
i...
you
know,
the
distinctions
that...
in
talking
with
the
postal
service
here,
i
mean,
it
may...
it...
one
would...
think
it
might
have
happened,
but
perhaps
it
hasn't.
hopefully,
it
hasn't.
but,
if
it
has,
i
mean,
it's
a
fine
distinction.
and
any
tort...
you
know,
a
first
year
tort
student
knows
that
tort
lines
can,
you
know,
give
rise
to
difficult
analysis
at
times.
but
if
you
understand
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
protect
here
was
the
movement
of
the
mail
and
the
handling
of
the
mail
in
a
way
that
the
postal
service
does--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
really
no
one
else--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
claim
for
the...
if
we're
assuming
it's
a
mispacking
of
the
mail
into
the
truck,
is
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--is
the
claim--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--then
that
is...
that
is
an...
i
mean,
plain
text
of
the
statute,
that
is
a...
an
allegation
that
we
negligently
transmitted
the
mail.
we
handled
it
negligently
in
how
we
packaged
it.
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--you
can
say
that,
but
what...
when
someone's...
you
know,
sues,
what
they're
upset
about
is
how
you
handled
the
vehicle,
not
how
you
handled
the
mail.
yes,
at
30,000
feet,
you
can
look
at
this
and
say
it's
all
transmission.
but
congress
was
looking
at
this
as,
sort
of,
on
the
ground
level.
and,
in
practical
experience,
the...
the
person
who
was
hit
by
the
mail
truck
doesn't
care
if
there's
mail
in
there
or
not.
their
injury
is
completely
unaffected...
the
presence
of
mail
is
incidental,
irrelevant--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--to
that
liability.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
but
that...
what
they've
been
injured
by...
the
presence
of
mail
is
the
cause
of
the
accident--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and
the
way
it
was
packed--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
"who
put
this
mail
here?
"
"this
is...
this
is...
mail
shouldn't
be
here.
"
i
mean,
you
have...
a
simple
way
of
looking
at
it
is,
you
have
two
things
going
on
at
the
same
time
in
the
car,
in
the
vehicle.
you've
got
the
regular
activity
of
driving,
and
you've
got
the
transmission
of
mail.
but
when
you
come
to
the
porch,
you
have
one
activity,
and
one
activity
only.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
that
is
transmission--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it's
the
character
as
mail
that
matters.
mail
that's
been
in
transmission
is
what
matters.
and
this--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--what
direct--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
may
not
be
delivering
mail
at
the
time
it
has
an
accident
with
you.
there's
no
way
the
delivery
of
mail
occurs
without
the
actual
delivery
of
mail.
that's
the
point.
but,
again,
you
have
a
text
here
that
does
not
admit
of
distinctions
based
on
what
kind
of
injury
happens
two
hours
later,
whether
it's
spoiled
food,
an
exploding
package,
or
a
trip.
and
if
it's
difficult...
this
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
the
fact
that
this
is
in
the
text,
this
case
doesn't
involve
a
vehicle,
and
that
this
case
raises
serious
concerns
for
the
postal
service
about
how
it's
going
to
handle
an
enormous--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--volume
of
mail.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
not
if
it's
transmission
of
the
mail,
because
the
exception
only
applies
to
negligent
transmission
of
the
mail.
and
so,
if
we
intentionally
bop
you
over
the
head
with
the
package,
that
would
not
be
within--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
exception.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
actually
negligent
or
wrongful
acts
are
covered.
there's
2680(h),
which
covers
a
number
of
intentional
torts
and...
it's
often
referred
to
as
the
intentional
tort
exception.
but,
actually,
it
wouldn't
cover...
the...
bopping
with
a
package
would
probably
be
assault.
but
if
we
deliver
a
package
that
has
anthrax
in
it,
i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
covered.
maybe
we
would
try
and
argue--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
fault
of
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right.
but
not
all--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but
not...
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
not
all--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--intentional
torts
fall
within
2680(h).
if
i
don't
like
you,
and
i
intentionally
deliver
your
mail
to
your
neighbor,
knowing
that
it's
got
your
inheritance
information
in
it,
i
don't
think
that
would
fall
within
2680(h),
which
normally...
it's
essentially...
largely
encompasses
interference
with
contracts
rights
instead
of
physical
assault,
battery,
those
types
of
claims.
but,
again,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
keep
in
mind
here
that
we
do
have...
we
have
text...
this
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
that
this
falls
within
the
text.
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
it.
their
way
does
not
capture
important
things
to
the
postal
service.
it
doesn't
seem
to
capture
what
is
admitted
into
the
mails,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
capture
the
important
decisions
that
are
made...
it
may
not
seem
so
important,
in
this
one
case,
to
have
put
the
mail
on
the
porch,
but
multiply
it
by
tens
of
millions
of
times
a
day
when
that
decision
is
made,
and
the
decision
that
that
balance,
of
putting
things
there
in
a
sheltered
way,
hopefully
that
will
both
protect
the
mail
and
the
people,
instead
of
either
reverting
to
person
to
person
delivery
for
all
oversized
mail
or
making
people
come
down,
like
the
old
days,
to
the
post
office
to
pick
it
up.
thank
you.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
then
i'll
probably--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--then
i'll
probably
be
subject
to
some
intentional
torts,
myself.
[laughter]
