we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
04-1618,
northern
insurance
company
of
new
york
v.
chatham
county,
georgia.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
assume
it's...
i
assume
it's
sort
of
a...
a
case
by
case
inquiry.
in
other
words,
the
county
could
be
an
arm
of
the
state
for
some
purposes
but
not
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
just
a...
it's
just
a
close
textual
reading
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
says
a
state.
it
doesn't
say
county.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
himmelfarb.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
doubt
that
a
county
could
have
sovereign
immunity
if
it
qualified
as
an
arm
of
the
state
in
a
particular
instance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your...
your
friend
in
the...
in
the
red
brief,
though,
reviews
a
lot
of
old
cases,
suggesting
at
the
time
of
the
founding,
that
counties
were
not
subject
to
suit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
himmelfarb.
mr.
hart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was...
in
many
of
those
cases
cited
in
your
brief,
it
was
because
the
duties
they
were
performing
they
were
performing
pro
bono
publico.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
doctrine
extended
immunity
to
them
on
that
basis,
not...
not
as
sovereigns.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
operating
bridges
at
the
time
of
the
framing
was
a
core
sovereign
function.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
private
bridges.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the...
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
you
weren't
asserting
that
you
were
an
arm
of
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
that
establishes
is
simply
that
if
the
state
were
operating
this
bridge
and
if
the
state
were
on
the
hook
for
any
judgments
and
if
the
state
had
control
over
the
people
who
were
making
the
decisions,
that
there
might
be
an
issue
of
state
sovereign
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
whole
problem
is
that
it's
the
county
that's
doing
all
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
state
doesn't
pay
the
damages.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
state
doesn't
tell
you
how
to
do
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
a
different
question.
the
immunity
looks
to
where
the
money
is
going
to
come
from
to
satisfy
a
judgment.
i
don't
think
it
looks
to
where
the
funding
came
from
in
the
first
instance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
the
claim
on
the
treasury
of
the
judgment
that
raises
the
sovereign
immunity
issues.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
unusual
that
counties
maintain
and
run
bridges
in
your
state,
is
it?
i
mean,
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
the
normal--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--then...
then
how
do
we
know
it's
a
core
dignity
function
of
the
state
if
they're...
the
normal
rule
is
somebody
else
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hart.
mr.
estrada,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're...
are
you
suggesting
that
the...
the
state
would
enjoy
sovereign
immunity
in
proprietary
activities?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
would
have
thought,
particularly
when
we're
talking
about
the
arm
of
the
state
doctrine,
that
the...
the
nature
of
the
activity
is
one
of
the
key
questions
we
look
at.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maintaining
bridges
is
one
thing.
you
know,
operating
a
for
profit
activity
would
be
something
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
in
04-1618
northern
insurance
company
of
new
york
verses
chatham
county,
georgia.
