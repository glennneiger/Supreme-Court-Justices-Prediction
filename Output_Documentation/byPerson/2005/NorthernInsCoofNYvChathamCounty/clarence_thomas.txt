justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
11th
circuit.
respondent
chatham
county,
georgia
--
chatham
county
is
where
savannah,
georgia
is
located,
which
for
a
variety
of
reasons
is
a
notable
city.
chatham
county
owns,
operates
and
maintains
a
drawbridge
over
the
wilmington
river.
petitioner
northern
insurance
company
insured
a
boat
that
was
damaged
by
the
drawbridge.
petitioner
filed
suit
in
admiralty
against
respondent
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
georgia.
although
respondent
conceded
that
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment
of
united
states
constitution
does
not
extend
to
counties,
it
contented
that
it
was
nevertheless
immune
from
the
lawsuit
under
the,
“universal
rule
of
state
immunity
from
suit
without
state’s
consent”.
relying
on
circuit
precedent,
the
district
court
concluded
that
sovereign
immunity
extends
to
counties
that,
“exercise
power
delegated
from
the
state”.
on
appeal,
the
11th
circuit
affirmed,
relying
on
the
same
circuit
precedent.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
our
cases
have
recognized
that
only
states
and
arms
of
the
state
are
entitled
to
immunity.
an
entity
qualifies
as
an
arm
of
the
state
only
if
it
satisfies
the
tests
that
we
have
applied
in
our
sovereign-immunity
cases.
there
is
no
residual
sovereign
immunity
that
permits
adoption
of
a
broader
test.
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
presumes,
as
the
county
concedes
below,
that
the
county
is
not
an
arm
of
the
state
under
our
sovereign-immunity
cases.
that
concession
dictates
our
holding
that
the
county
is
not
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity.
we
also
hold
that
there
is
no
distinct
sovereign
immunity
from
in
personam
admiralty
suits.
we
have
historically
applied
the
same
immunity
principles
to
admiralty
cases
as
to
other
federal
cases.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
