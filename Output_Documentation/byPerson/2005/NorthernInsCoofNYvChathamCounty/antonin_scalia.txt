justice
antonin
scalia
well...
i...
i
guess,
in...
in
going
beyond
the
eleventh
amendment,
we
were
appealing
to
an
understanding
of
sovereignty
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
framing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
at
the
time
of
the
framing,
counties
in
england
did
not
enjoy
the...
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
king,
did
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you...
do
you
agree
that...
that
it's
possible
that
an
entity
can
have
sovereign
immunity
in
admiralty
where...
where
the
same
entity
would...
would
not
have
it
elsewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
that
discussion
quite
perplexing.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
talking
about
immunity
in
most
of
the
cases,
not
necessarily--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
necessarily
sovereign
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
hans...
hans
is
residual
sovereign
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
some...
some
of
our
brethren
don't...
don't
agree
with
it.
they
don't
like
the
residue
and
would
limit
it
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
going
to
have
a
residue,
hans
is
it
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
nor
could
charities.
they
were
immune
as
well.
but
it...
it
certainly
wasn't
sovereign
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
presented
is...
is
only
sovereign
immunity,
isn't
it?
it's...
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
there
might
be
some
other
type
of
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hart--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
core...
core
government
functions
isn't...
isn't
the
test
either.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
the
federal
government
and
i
think
some
states
gave...
gave
railroads
the
power
to
condemn
land.
did
that
make
railroads
sovereigns
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
mere
fact
that...
that
your
county
is
exercising
some,
quote,
core
government
functions,
that...
that
doesn't...
doesn't
get
you
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
sovereign
immunity.
it
was...
charities
had
immunity
until
very
recently.
some
states
still
had
it
when
i
was
in
law
school.
you
couldn't
sue
a
charity
for
tort.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
you
relying
on
in
the
georgia
constitution?
it
doesn't
mention
counties,
does
it?
it
just
says
except
as
specifically
provided
in
this
paragraph,
sovereign
immunity
extends
to
the
state
and
all
of
its
departments
and
agencies.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
can
be
no...
no...
well,
i
assume
you
have
a...
a
tort...
tort
claims
act
that
waives
sovereign
immunity
in
some
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
apart
from
that,
you
can't
sue
counties
in
tort.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
bridge
immunity,
not
sovereign
immunity.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
come...
it
doesn't
come
within
the
federal
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
textually.
i'm
talking
about
in
structure.
there's
nothing
in
the
structure
that
has
anything
to
do
with
bridges.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
wishes.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
can
pay
my
damages
if
it
wishes.
it
just
doesn't
happen
to
have
a
statute
to
that
effect
right
now.
but
i
mean,
that...
surely,
that
doesn't...
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
was
an
old
fifth
circuit
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
always
thought
the
governmental
proprietary
distinction
really
came
up
in
state
law
cases
involving
municipal
liability.
that's
principally
where
it--
