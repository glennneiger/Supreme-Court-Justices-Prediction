mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
this
admiralty
case,
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
chatham
county,
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
georgia,
is
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity
in
federal
court.
that
is
wrong
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first,
for
well
over
a
century,
this
court
consistently
has
held
that
counties
and
other
political
subdivisions
are
not
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity.
and
second,
in
the
specific
context
of
in
personam
admiralty
cases,
the
same
rule
has
been
recognized
for
over
100
years.
to
go
to
my
first
point,
in
lincoln
county
v.
luning,
decided
in
1890,
this
court
squarely
held
that
counties
and
other
political
subdivisions
are
not
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity.
there
are
three,
or
at
least
three,
significant
aspects
of
lincoln
county
that
bear
emphasis.
the
first
one
is
that
even
by
1890,
the
court
was
able
to
say
that
in
its
own
cases
it
could
see
decades
of
case
law
where
counties
had
been
a
defendant
without
any
objection
being
raised.
the
second
was
that
an
important
aspect
of
the
court's
reasoning
was
the
recognition
that
when
a
county
is
sued,
the
state
is
not
a
real
party
in
interest,
not
the
real
party
in
interest,
which
is
another
way
of
saying
that
the
county
is
not
an
arm
of
the
state,
the
issue
before
here
us
today.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
am
not
aware
of
any
county
that
has
been
organized
so
as
to
meet
the
requirements
that
this
court
set
forth
in
hess
and
other
cases
for
an
arm
of
the
state.
this
is,
of
course,
not
a
question
of
labeling.
it
is
possible
that
the...
that
a...
that
a
particular
state
would
associate
so
closely
with
a
county,
so
closely
control
its...
its
acts,
and
be
on
the
hook
for
its
liabilities,
that
under
this
court's
cases
it
could
be
an
arm
of
the
state,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
in
fact--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is...
that
is
a
possibility,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
not
aware
this
county
would
meet
that
inquiry
with
respect
to
what
we
have
here.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
essentially
two
propositions.
one
is
that
the
county,
like
every
other
county
in
the
country,
exercises
a
slice
of
state
power,
and
that
was
something
that
was
found
unremarkable
by
this
court
in
lake
country
estates.
and
the
second
one
is
that
this
county,
like
many
other
organs
of
government,
may
get
funding,
even
substantial
funding,
from
the
state,
and
again,
that
was
found
unremarkable
in
mt.
healthy
by
this
court.
what
is
controlling
here
is
that
the
county,
like
most
counties
or
maybe
all
counties,
enjoys
a
significant
amount
of
autonomy,
has
the
power
under
the
state
law
to
raise
its
own
revenues
through
taxes
and
bonds,
and
that
the
state
is
ultimately
not
liable
for
its
debts.
and
under...
under
those
factors,
the
county
is
unable
to
meet
any
definition
of
arm
of
the
state
that
has
ever
been
articulated
by
this
court's
cases.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
think
as
a...
as
a
fundamental
feature
of
the
federal
system
and...
and
the
plan
of
the
convention,
that
the
states
came
together
as
sovereigns
to
form
a
new
country,
and
under
this
court's
cases,
the
immunity
that
they
retain
is
called
residual
because
it
is
recognized
that
insofar
as
they
did
not
relinquish
it
to
the
national
government,
they
kept
it.
there
is
no
historical
record
of
the
founding
that
contemplates
that
counties
came
to
the
convention
as
sovereigns.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
might
be
the
end
of
the
case,
in
fairness,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
eleventh
amendment
were
the
source
of
the
sovereign
immunity
that
this
court
has
recognized,
but
we
know
from
cases
like
alden
v.
maine
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
merely
an
example
of
the
structural
immunity
that
is
implicit
in
the
structure
of
the
constitution.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
because
they
came
to
the
convention
as
sovereigns.
let
me
say
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--exactly
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
do
not
believe
that
counties
anywhere
at
the
time
of
the
founding
enjoyed
the
sovereign
immunity
that
was...
that
has
been
recognized
by
this
court's
cases.
and
you're
right,
justice
scalia,
that
this
has
been
reflected
in...
in
the
federalist
papers,
81,
by
hamilton.
it
was
clear,
at
least
to
some
of
the
founders,
that
this
was
a
feature
that
need
not
be
stated
in
the
constitution
in
order
to
recognized.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
it
is...
it
is
what
the
history
was
and
what
the
plan
of
the
convention
was,
and
it's
also
a
recognition,
even
functionally,
that
we're
talking
about
sovereign
immunity.
and
i
think
most
common
sense
understandings
of
what
a
sovereign
is
would
imply
at
least
the
ability
to
prescribe
law
for
the
government
of
others
without
having
to
draw
your
authority
for
that
from
a
higher
source
and
without
being
accountable
to
a
higher
source.
a
state
within
the
respective
sphere
would
meet
that
requirement,
but
that
would
not
be
true
of
counties.
i
will
point
out,
as
my
third
point
with
respect
to
the
lincoln
county
case,
is
that
the...
the
case
came
down
march
3rd,
1890,
which
was
the
same
day
that
the
court
handed
down
hans
v.
louisiana.
and
that
is
significant
because,
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
holding
of
hans
has
been
the
subject
of
significant
disagreement
over
the
years
since
by
members
of
past
and
current
courts,
and
many
members
of
the
courts
have
viewed
hans
as
an
unwarranted
extension
of
sovereign
immunity.
if
the
court
was
not
prepared
to
extend
immunity
to
counties
on
the
day
that
it
ruled
on
hans,
it
seems
hard
to
see
why
it
would
do
it
now.
and
in
fact,
the
history
of
this
court's
cases
since
then
reflects
an
almost
inflexible
understanding,
again
and
again,
that
counties
and
political
subdivisions
are
not
entitled
to
the
state's
immunity.
with
respect
to
my
second
point--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
will
settle
for
thoughtful,
but
i'm
hoping
for
inflexible.
[laughter]
with
respect
to
my
second
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
workman
v.
city
of
new
york
squarely
dealt
with
the
question
whether
a
political
subdivision,
a...
a
municipality
made
up
of
four
counties
in
that
case,
was
entitled
to
immunity
in
an
admiralty
suit
in
personam,
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
answer
was
no.
now,
the
only
argument
i
have
heard
for
why
workman
is
not
controlling
in
this
case
has
been
that
somehow
in
ex
parte
new
york
no.
1,
this
court
cast
doubt
on
that
holding.
but
if
you
look
at
the
portion
that
is
being
relied
on,
all
that
the
court
said
in
ex
parte
new
york
was
it
cited
one
of
the
distinctions
between
the
new
york
case
and
workman,
when
it
could
have
cited
two.
that's
not
enough
to
override
what
the
case
actually
says.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
started
with
the
luning
county
is
that
even
if
there
were
any
doubt
on
the
question
or
even
if
ex
parte
new
york
have
cast
enough
doubt
under
workman,
despite
the
uniform
understanding
since
workman
that
that's
what
the
rule
is,
the
fact
that
this
court
in
every
other
context
of
sovereign
immunity
has
consistently
held
that
counties
are
not
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity
ought
to
be
dispositive
of
the
question
there
as
well.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
do
not
believe
that
is
possible,
and
with
respect
to
the
argument
to
that
effect
that
is
being
advanced
by
respondent,
a
close
reading
of
the
cases
being
cited
will
disclose
that
they're
not,
in
fact,
unique
to
admiralty.
they
are
common
law
cases
about
what
the...
what
the
power--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--sovereign
immunity.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
right.
and...
and
another
important
distinction,
justice
scalia,
is
that
even
if
one
could
unearth
a...
a
body
of
case
law
that
recognized
municipal
immunity
at
the
time
of
the
founding,
it
would
not
become
sovereign
immunity,
and
that's
the
only
issue
that
is...
that
is
in
contention
here.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right,
justice
stevens.
and
if
this
court
had
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
were
the
source
or
even
the
sole
source
of
sovereign
immunity,
that
would
be
a
compelling
argument.
the
main
holding
of
the
ex
parte
new
york
no.
1
case
is,
indeed,
that
that
limitation
does
not
apply
because,
as
understood
by
hans,
which
had
been
ruled
on
some
31
years
earlier,
the
sovereign
immunity
really
comes
from
the
structure
of
the
constitution.
and
the
state
of
this...
this
court's
doctrine
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment's
sole
purpose
was
to
overrule
the
holding
in
chisholm,
and
that
but
for
the
fact
that
chisholm
came
down,
the
eleventh
amendment
never...
if
the
eleventh...
if
the
eleventh
amendment
had
never
been
enacted,
every
sovereign
immunity
case
would
come
out
the
same
way.
that
is
the
current
understanding
by
the
court
about
how
the
doctrine
works.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is...
that
is
true,
though
with
respect
to
chisholm
and
the
issue
in
this
case,
justice...
justice
stevens,
it
is
very
instructive
that
both
sides
of
the
argument
in
the
chisholm
case
understood
that
the
issue
was
whether
states
may
get
sovereign
immunity.
both
sides
conceded
that
political
subdivisions
didn't.
chief
justice
jay
for
the
majority
argued
that
it
made
no
sense
to
extend
sovereign
immunity
when
a...
where...
where
a
city
like
the
size
of
philadelphia
was
the
same
size
and
had
as
many
inhabitants
as
it
did
of
delaware,
and
that's
what
he
argued.
and
justice
iredell,
whose
views
have
come
to
command
a
majority
of
the
court,
saw
it
to
his
argument
to
distinguish
political
subdivisions
from
states,
so
that
even
though
this
court's
first
holding
was
not
until
1890,
it
was
embedded
in
the
understanding
at
the
founding,
as...
as
shown
even
by
chisholm,
that
political
subdivisions
were
not
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
points.
on
the
issue
that
was
raised
by
justice
alito,
the...
this
doctrine
comes
from
the
wickman
case
from
the
old
fifth
circuit.
that
case
relied
primarily
on
a...
on
a
case
called
kegan
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
which
was,
indeed,
a
bridge
case,
but
it
was
not
an
admiralty
case.
it
was
a
case
in
which
someone
who
was
crossing
a
bridge
with
a
heavy
truck
fell
through
the
bridge
because
the...
the
bridge
was
structurally
unsafe.
the
old
fifth
circuit
sort
of
took
it
as
a
bridge
case
and
took
over
that
doctrine.
if
that
fact...
the
scenario
were
to
come
up
in
chatham
county
and
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants
were
diverse,
there
is
no
question
that...
that
the
county
would
be
entitled
to
plead
its
state
law
immunity
under
erie.
i
will
point
out
incidentally
that
even
though
in
this
case
there
is
diversity
of
citizenship
and
admiralty
jurisdiction,
this
court
held
in
1953
in
a
case
called
pope
&
talbot
v.
hawn
that
in
that
circumstance,
any
defense
that
is
available
solely
on
the
diversity
side
under
erie
gets
trumped
by
the
uniform
application
of
the
maritime
law.
so
that
would
not
be
an
issue
here.
with
respect
to
the
question
that
was
raised
by
justice
ginsburg,
hines
was
an
admiralty
case
in
state
court.
under
no
stretch
of
construction
could
that
be
viewed
as
an
eleventh
amendment
case
since
it
was
not
a
case
in
law
or
equity
and
it
was
not
in
federal
court.
and
number
three,
the
proprietary
governmental
distinction
has
been
rejected
in
the
workman
case
itself
where
it
was
raised
in
the
specific
context
of
admiralty.
i
will
point
out
it
has
never
been
part
of
this
court's
sovereign
immunity
doctrine,
and
with
respect,
other
areas
of
federalism
law
tend
to
indicate
that
the
issue
not
be
adopted
now.
you
may
recall
that
such
a
distinction
between
core
and
non
core
governmental
functions
was
at
the
core
of
the...
of
this...
this
court's
cases
under
national
league
of
cities
v.
usery,
and
in
the
garcia
case,
the
court
overruled
national
league
of
cities
primarily
on
the
point
that
the
distinction
between
core
and
non
core
governmental
functions
had
proven
to
be
unworkable.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
am
suggesting
that
if
you
named
the
state
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
caption
on
the
v
in
federal
court,
it
does
enjoy
sovereign
immunity,
irrespective
of
what
your
cause
of
action
is.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
it's...
it's
sort
of
inherent
in
all
the
cases
that
have
been
ruled
upon,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
what
tends
to
be
delegated
are
those
that
are
the
normal
functions
of
government,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
held
that
it
is
the
function
of
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
to
tell
the
states
what
are
the
appropriate
functions
of
government.
so
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
distinction
that
would
be
supported
by
the
cases.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
did
early
on,
and
that
was...
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
was
put
forth
in
the
workman
case,
justice
scalia.
with
respect
to
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
u.s.
courts,
this
court
said
in
1901
that
it
carries
no
weight.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
nothing
further.
