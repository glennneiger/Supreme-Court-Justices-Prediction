mr.
dan
himmelfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
states
enjoy
a
constitutionally
protected
immunity
from
suit,
but
cities
and
counties
do
not.
that
principle
has
been
established
by
an
unbroken
line
of
precedent
dating
back
to
the
19th
century
and
was
applied
to
an
admiralty
suit
more
than
100
years
ago
in
workman
v.
city
of
new
york.
both
workman
and
the
principle
it
applied
answered
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
workman
held
that,
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
law
of
admiralty,
a
political
subdivision
is
not
entitled
to
immunity
from
suit.
in
the
course
of
deciding
that
question,
the
court
explained
that
if
the
government
entity
defendant
in
an
admiralty
suit
were
a
sovereign,
it
would
be
entitled
to
immunity,
not
as
a
matter
of
admiralty
law,
but
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
sovereign
immunity,
in
which
case
the
court
would
be
without
jurisdiction.
the
court
went
on
to
say,
however...
and
this
is
at
page
570
of
the
opinion...
the
municipal
corporation
of
the
city
of
new
york
unlike
a
sovereign
was
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
workman's
holdings
resolved
the
issue
in
the
case.
but
the
result
would
be
the
same
even
if
workman
had
never
been
decided.
from
the
lincoln
county
case
in
1890
through
the
richland
county
case
in
2003,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
states,
but
not
cities
or
counties,
are
sovereign
and
that
states,
but
not
cities
or
counties,
are
therefore
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity.
a
city
or
county
is
no
more
a
sovereign
in
an
admiralty
case
than
it
is
in
any
other
type
of
case.
the
theory
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
relied
was
that
not
only
states
but
what
it
called
political
subdivisions
of
states
are
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity,
at
least
when
the...
the
political
subdivision
is
exercising
a
power
delegated
by
the
state.
but
that's
no
different
from
saying
that
cities
and
counties
are,
after
all,
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity
because
every
city
or
county
is
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state
and
every
city
or
county
exercises
power
delegated
by
the
state,
what
this
court
has
called
a
slice
of
state
power.
so
the
apparent
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
just
flatly
inconsistent
with
more
than
a
century
of
this
court's
precedent.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
of
course,
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
all
agree
that
chatham
county
is
not
an
arm
of
the
state
for
purposes
of
this
court's
constitutional
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
so
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
some
other
ground
on
which
the
county
would
be
entitled
to
immunity,
and
there's
none.
respondent's
theory
is
that
there
are
two
distinct
notions
of
sovereign
immunity,
what
it
calls
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
what
it
calls
residual
sovereign
immunity.
a
fundamental
flaw
in
that
theory
is
that
there
is
only
one
doctrine
of...
of
constitutional
sovereign
immunity.
what
respondent
calls
residual
sovereign
immunity
and
what
this
court
has
sometimes
identified
as
the
immunity
associated
with
the
residuary
sovereignty
that
comes
from
federalist
39
is
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
scalia,
and
every
case
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
true,
justice
scalia.
the...
the
theory
of
residual
immunity
is
that
before
the
constitution
was
established,
states
were
sovereign.
when
they
entered
the
union,
they
surrendered
some
aspects
of
their
sovereignty
and
retained
other
aspects
of
it.
one
aspect
that
they
retained
was
an
immunity
from
suit.
a
city
or
county
is
not
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity
because
it
wasn't
a
sovereign
at
the
time
of
the
founding
and
thus
had
no
immunity...
no
sovereignty
either
to
surrender
or
to
retain.
from
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
i
don't
think
the
cases
that
respondent
cites
do,
in
fact,
stand
for
that
proposition.
in
fact,
the
principal
authority
upon
which
respondent
relies,
the
men
of
devon
case,
which
is
an
english
case,
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
was
neither
an
admiralty
case
nor
a
case
that
accorded
immunity
to
the
county.
the
case,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
was
a
straightforward
negligence
case,
and
the
holding
of
the
case
was
that
inhabitants
of
the
county,
as
distinct
from
the
corporate
entity,
the
county
itself,
cannot
be
held
liable
in
a
negligence
suit.
so
i
don't
think
that
that
case
provides
any
support
for
respondent's
theory.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
scalia.
at
the
time
of
the
founding,
various
entities,
including
sub
state
governmental
entities,
were
entitled
to
some
forms
of
immunity.
this
court
traces
the
history
of
municipal
immunity
at
some
length
in
the
owen
v.
city
of
independence
case.
but
as...
as
you
just
pointed
out,
justice
scalia,
whatever
immunity
that
was,
it
was
not
sovereign
immunity,
and
there's
no
basis
for
constitutionalizing
it
in
the
context
of
this
court's
constitutional
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
any
more
than
there's
a
basis
for
constitutionalizing
the
immunity
that
a
private
entity
or
an
even
an
individual
might
have
enjoyed
at
the
time
of
the
founding.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that
in
and
of
itself,
justice
stevens,
would
not.
this
court's
cases
make
clear
that
in
deciding
whether
an
entity
is
an
arm
of
the
state,
there
are
three
principal
considerations
to
take
into
account.
you've
identified
one
of
them,
which
is
the
classification
of
the
entity
under
state
law.
the
other
two,
which
are
probably
more
important,
are
whether
the
state
would
ultimately
be
liable
for
a
judgment
against
the
political
entity
and
also
the
extent
of
control
exercised
by
the
state
over
the
entity.
it's
important
to
point
out,
with
respect
to
the
latter
of
those
two
considerations,
that
control
in
this
context
doesn't
mean
simply
that
the
county
has
been
delegated
authority
by
the
states
since,
after
all,
all
counties
are...
are
delegated
authority
by
the
state.
it
means
that
there's
more
of
a
day
to
day
control,
for
example,
that
it
is
the
governor
who
appoints
the
members
of
the
commission
that
governs
the
particular
entity,
the
governor
who
has
the
power
to
remove
them.
the
governor
may
have
veto
power.
that's
the
sort
of
considerations
that
courts
have
taken
into
account
in
deciding
whether
the
control
element
of
the
arm
of
the
state
inquiry
is
satisfied.
there
is
no
basis
for
any
notion
of
constitutional
sovereign
immunity
beyond
the
one
identified
by
this
court.
consequently,
there's
no
basis
for
any
arm
of
the
state
test
other
than
that
applied
by
the
court
in
its
cases
involving
the
one
doctrine
of
constitutional
sovereign
immunity.
the
only
other
possibility
that
would
entitle
respondent
to
prevail
in
this
case
would
be
some
notion
of
non
constitutional
immunity
unique
to
admiralty.
but,
of
course,
whatever
else
workman
held...
and
respondent
takes
the
position
that
workman
did
not
decide
the
constitutional
issue.
we
think
it
did,
for
the
reasons
i've
already
stated.
but
whatever
else
it
held,
it
clearly
held
that,
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
law
of
admiralty,
political
subdivisions
are
not
entitled
to
immunity
from
suit.
so
the
court
could
not
adopt
a
non
constitutional
rule
of
immunity
limited
to
the
admiralty
context
without
overruling
workman.
respondent
does
not
ask
the
court
to
do
that.
and
indeed,
so
far
as
i
can
tell
from
reading
respondent's
brief,
it
does
not
even
advocate
a
non
constitutional
rule
of
immunity
for
admiralty
cases.
so
there's
no
non
constitutional
basis
for
immunity.
the
only
constitutional
basis
for
immunity
is
when
the
political
entity
is
an
arm
of
the
state.
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
all
agree
that
chatham
county
is
not.
it
necessarily
follows,
therefore,
that
chatham
county
was
not
entitled
to
immunity
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
right.
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
to
the
extent
that
sovereign
immunity
is
understood
to
mean
constitutional
immunity,
as
distinct
from
some
judge
made
or
statutory
immunity,
that's
right.
