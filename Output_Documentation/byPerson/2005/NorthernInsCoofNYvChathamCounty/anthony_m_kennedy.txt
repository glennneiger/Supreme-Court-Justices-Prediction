justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
the
failure
to
extend
immunity
to
counties
and
municipal
entities
in
a
state
just
a
historical
relic?
it
depends
on
semantics.
or
is
there
some
normative
or
good
government
policy
that
dictates
the
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's...
it's
a
matter
of
respecting
the
dignity
of
the
states
because
they
participated
in
the
convention,
the
plan
of
convention?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
a
historical
relic
based
on
the
dignity
of
the
state,
or
the
king
in
one
case,
and
the
corresponding
lack
of
dignity
of
the
entities
on
the
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you...
would
you
say
thoughtful
rather
than
inflexible?
