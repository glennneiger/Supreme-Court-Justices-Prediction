mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
the
county
that
has
been
expressly
delegated
the
core
sovereign
function
by
the
state,
unique
or
sovereign
function,
such
as
navigable
waters,
is
entitled
to
residual
sovereign
immunity
in
an
in
personam
admiralty
action.
justice
ginsburg
just
asked
a
question
about
counties
in
cases.
i
know
of
no
case
where
a
state
has
delegated
a
core
sovereign
function,
cloaked
the
entity
with
immunity,
in
which
this
court
has
ruled
is
not
the
arm
of
the
state.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
who
pays
judgments
against
the
county
is
initially
probably
the
county,
but
under
georgia
law,
the
department
of
dot...
department
of
transportation
has
a
fund
in
which
they
can
contribute
towards
that.
and
if
you
look
in...
and
i
think
funding
matters
less
here
than...
than
the
fact
that
these
big
projects
are
generally
a
collage
of
funding
issues.
you
have
state
and
federal
money
usually
mixed
in.
so
you're
in
a
situation
where,
you
know,
if
you
went
back
50
years
ago
and
looked
at
funding,
it
might
be
very
definitive.
in
these
days
and
times,
if
you
look
at
projects,
you
know,
you
got
money
coming
from
all
sources,
and
if
you
start
tracing
the...
the
money,
you
can
go
in
six
different
directions.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
and
i
think
the
dignity
interest...
excuse
me.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
well,
i
think
the
hess
case
says
that...
that
it...
that
it's
one
of
the
default
issues,
and
then
you
go
to
the
dignity
interest
and
the
funding
interest.
but
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
california
regents
case
v.
john
doe,
in
that
case,
it
shows
and
explains
why
funding
becomes
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
way
of
meaningful
factors--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--i
understand
that.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
no,
sir,
i
wouldn't
argue
that.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
well,
i
think
you
look
at
the...
the
history,
you
look
at
the
dignity
of
the
state,
and
you
look
at
the
functional
realities
of
state
management.
and
if
you
look
at
the
history,
counties
were
immune
at
common
law
in
england.
counties
were
immune
at
the
time
of
the
framing.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
sure.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
well,
it
extended...
it
extended
to
them
as
part
of
an
overall
sovereignty...
sovereign
immunity
picture.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
i
still
think
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
these
core
functions
and
if
you...
if
you
define
that
as
something
that's
being
delegated
by
the
state
where
the
state
says
we
want
you
to
have
sovereign
immunity,
then
that's
something
that
should
be
respected
as
part
of
the
dignity
of
the
state.
in
this
particular
case,
georgia
is
extremely
strong
on
that
point.
it's
in
the
constitution
that...
that
counties
can
handle
bridges.
it's
in
the
constitution
that
they're
immune.
you
can
only
waive
it
by
an
act
of
the
legislature.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
torts.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
i
think
the...
i
think...
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
under...
like
a
1983
action
or
a
fourteenth
amendment
exception
under
section
5,
i
don't
think
the
immunity
would
reach
that
far.
i
think
the
county
would
still
be
exposed
to
the
liability
there
under
that
case
law.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
do
away
with
what
you
have
under
the
fourteenth
amendment...
excuse
me...
under
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the
case
laws
thereunder.
but
i
don't
think
that
those...
those
cases
under
there
define
the
whole
sovereign
immunity
of
the
general
principles--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--not
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
yes,
sir.
and
there's
strong
case
law,
the
millwood
case,
that
says
basically
counties
are
part
of
the
sovereign
of
the
state.
and
as
recently
as
last
year,
in
a
lawsuit
against
the
department
of
corrections,
the...
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
argued
that
the
county
was
a
sovereign
of
the
state,
part
of
the
state,
took
the
position
it
couldn't
be
sued
because
a
sovereign
can't
sue
itself.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
you
can...
generally
in
the...
in...
the
county...
as
a
state
law
claim,
no,
unless
there's
a
waiver.
now,
the
legislature
has
waived...
there's
been
quite
a
few
waivers
in
the
last
year.
they
just
waived
in
automobile
insurance
cases,
for
example.
and...
and
that's
a
matter
of
the
state.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
we
would
contend
that
the
core
sovereign
function
has
to
truly
be
a
core
sovereign
function
and
it
has
to
be
supported
by
some
type
of
history,
some
type
of...
of
state
dignity
there
and...
and
some
reality--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--and
we
would
not
put
education
in
that
class.
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
history
at
the
time
of
framing,
you
have
to
start
looking
at
what
government
did
do
and
didn't
do.
now,
you
could
do
a
historical
analysis,
and
maybe
i
would
be
wrong
and
the
history
would
show
that
education
was
important.
but
my
understanding
is
education
at
that
time
was
probably
a
pretty
local
matter.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
that
would
get
sort
of
iffy
there
from
the
standpoint
that
public
health,
quarantines,
those
type
of
services
for
disease
were
handled
by
the
state
and
were
handled
in
a...
in
a
manner
that
you
might
be
able
to
define
it
as
a
core
function,
but
that
would
probably
be
a
stretch.
this
is
a
narrow
exception
and
we
think
it
deserves
that
insofar
as
the
navigable
waters.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
well,
it--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--yes,
sir.
the...
the
exception,
though,
was
at
common
law,
counties
could
not
be
liable
for
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
bridges,
and
that
was
adopted
by
georgia
prior
to
the
time
of
the
framing
and
that
was
the
law
of
the
state.
and
we
would
take
the
position
that
that
survived
under
this
residual
sovereign
immunity
theory.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
well,
we're...
we're
focusing
that--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--well,
neither
does
federal
sovereign
immunity
come
textually
within
the
constitution.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
if
you
look
at
the...
the
function
of...
of
state
government
and
you
look
at
what
they
define
as
being
important...
and
in
this
case,
georgia
has
defined
that
as
one
of
the
functions
under
its
constitution
and
under
its
statutes...
then
there's
a
dignity
interest
there
that
ought
to
be
respected
insofar
as
outside
that
realm.
one
of
the--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--yes,
sir,
i
believe
that.
we
don't
concede
that
we
might
not
fit
in
the...
that
we
could...
could
not
fit
in
within
the
arm
of
the
state.
the
court
chose
in
the
question
presented
not
to
address
that
issue
and
asked
us
to
address
the
issue
outside...
assuming
we
were
not
an...
we
were
a
non
arm
of
the
state.
and
our
brief
does
make
some
mention
of...
of
the
arm
of
the
state
analysis
within
in.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
well,
we
were
asserting
that
we
were...
we
were
immune
under
residual
sovereign
immunity
and
we
conceded
for...
that
the
county
has
not
generally
been
recognized
under
the
eleventh
amendment
as
being
sovereign...
as
sovereign...
having
sovereign
immunity.
that
is
not
to...
and...
and
we
needed
some
way
to
distinguish
that
from
the
immunity
that
we're
arguing,
the
immunity
retained
by
the
states.
and
we
feel
that
that's
something
that
could...
could
have
broader
parameters
than...
than
the
current
arm
of
the
state
test.
and
the
focus
ought
to
be
on
these
core
functions,
history,
dignity,
and
the
functionality
of
the
state.
that
takes
you
away
from
your
eleventh
amendment
analysis
where
you're
dealing
with
sovereign
immunity
all
the
time
in...
in
that
context,
and
you're
now
moving
to
discussing
general
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
outside
the
context
of
the
eleventh
amendment
in
defining
those
contours,
and
we
feel
like
this
might
give
you
a
mechanism
by
which
to
do
that.
and
it's
a
very
narrow
exception,
and
it
would
be
something
that
the
court
could
rule
on
or
the
court
could
simply
rule
that
counties
were
immune
in
in
personam
admiralty
actions,
if
you
wanted
to
make
it
even
a
more
narrow
ruling.
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
argued
by
the
solicitor
general
is
that
there's
a
single
sovereign
immunity,
that
there's
this
unified
sovereign
immunity.
and
it's...
and
to
the
extent
that
we're
talking
about
general
principles
of
sovereign
immunity,
we
agree
with
that.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
part
that
says
that
when
we
deal
with
eleventh
amendment
arm
of
the
state,
that
that
part
defines
the
whole.
and
when
you
get
into
a
situation
of...
of
how
do
you
define
the
sovereign...
sovereign
immunity,
you
have
sovereign
immunity
at
the
federal
government
level,
and
if
it's
a
single
sovereign
immunity
that
you
accept
and
as
argued
by
the...
by...
by
the
solicitor
general's
office,
then
the
question
becomes,
is
there
a
reciprocal
sovereign
immunity
that's
coextensive
with
federal
sovereign
immunity?
and
that's
an
argument
that...
that
certainly
could
be
made.
it...
and
it
was
addressed
somewhat
or
raised
somewhat
in
alden
where
they
discussed
we're
not
ready
to
say
it's
the
federal
government
is
raising
sovereign
immunity,
which
they
do
on
a
regular
basis,
that
perhaps
the
states
might
not
have
that.
now,
we're
not
arguing
that
the
county
in
any
way
would
have
sovereign
immunity
to
the
extent
of
the
federal
government.
we're
saying
that
insofar
as
these
functions
that
have
a
history
at
common
law
at
the
time
of
the
framing
and
has
been
consistently
recognized
by
the
supreme
court,
navigable
waters
and
the
soils
thereunder
have
always
been
considered
to
be
a
sovereign
interest
of
the
state
by
this
court.
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
st.
anthony
falls
case,
at
that
time
they
were
dealing
with
riparian
rights,
and...
and
there
was
a
deference
to
the
state
in
regard
to
that.
you
also
had
the
coeur
d'alene
indian
tribe
dealing
with
submerged
lands,
and
you
recognized
the
sovereign
interests
of
the
state
in
those
situations,
and
in
the
seminole
tribe
case,
said
there's
no
exception
in
regard
to
carving
out
an
exception
to
an
admiralty
immunity.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
we
understand
that,
but
we're
acting
on
behalf
of
the
state
and
acting
as
the
state
there
and--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--the
state--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--the
state
has
the
potential
to
pay
damages
there
through...
through
the
dot,
the
department
of
transportation,
funds.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
if
it
wishes.
i
have
to
concede
that
point.
but
from
the...
from
the
standpoint,
if
you
go
back
to
the
california
regents
case,
there
wasn't
a
whole
lot
of
potential
liability
there.
theoretically
they
may
have,
but
they
had
a
contract.
the
state
had
a
contract
there
in
which
it
was
indemnified
by...
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
well,
we
take
the
position
that
the
funding
issue
and
the
control
issue
ought
to
be
less...
outside
of
the
eleventh
amendment
analysis,
arm
of
the
state
ought
to
be
something
that
matters
less.
the
dignity
interest
ought
to
matter
more.
the
funding
issue
is
something
that
in
every
major
project,
you've
got
a
collage
of
funding,
and
it
comes
from
all
different
sources.
and
to
some
extent,
who
pays
the
bill
and
how
they
pay
the
bill
depends
on
the
structure
of
the
deal.
and
i
don't
think
it's
very
enlightening,
as
it
was
once
50
years
ago
when
things
were
much
simpler.
we're
also
talking
about,
in
bridge
cases
or
most
building
road
projects,
you
have
the
situation
where
a
lot
of
times
the
state
comes
to
one
of
its
entities
and
says,
we'll
give
you
the
money,
build
a
bridge.
we'll
build...
build
the
road.
quite
frequently
that
happens
all
the
time
in
larger
counties.
if
the
county
does
the
function
that
it's
doing
for
the
state--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--well,
the...
the--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--insofar
as
this
case
goes,
there
is
the
potential
for
payment
by
the
state,
and...
and
that's
about
all
we
can
say
there.
we'll
have
to...
we...
as
justice
scalia
said,
is...
is
there
a
absolute
need
for
them
to
pay
them?
but...
but
the
practicality
of
it
is
usually
when
they
delegate
you
the
function
and
the
state
arms
you
with
sovereign
immunity
and
tells
you
to
go
out
and
do
that,
they
will
step
up
to
the
batter's
box
at
the
time
something
like
that
would
occur
because
they
have
sort
of
delegated
that
core
function
to
you
to
do.
the
control
issue
we
feel
is
something
that
the
dignity
issue
ought
to
take
precedence
over.
the
control
issue
is
something
that
the
state
decides
during
the
delegation,
and
if
you
wish
to
place
an
emphasis
on
the
control,
then
you're
asking...
asking
basically
do
you
require
the
state
to
make
a
certain
kind
of
delegation.
earlier
we
had
a
question
that...
that
followed
up
on
the
issue
of
if
there...
if
we
just
did
a
single
function
alone,
built
a
bridge
without
anything
else,
would
that
alone
create
a
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
county.
and
i
think
in...
in
regard
to
that,
the
core
function
here
is
the
county
accepting
the
responsibility
of
the
state.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
yes,
ma'am.
the
hines
case
was
an
eleventh
amendment
case,
number
one.
number
two,
it...
it
did
state,
in
the
front
end
of
the
case,
that
they
would
apply
the
substantive
law
of
admiralty
irrespectively
of
the
forum.
but
the
residual
sovereign
immunity
issue
was
never
argued
by
either
side
in
the
case.
that
case
went
up
on...
as
a
result
of
the
granting
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
a
fairly
skimpy
record
there,
and
the
funding
issue
was
never
really...
really
analyzed
there.
so
we
see
that
as
a...
a
case
that
typically
is
an
eleventh
amendment
case
and
there
has
not
been
any
ruling
whatsoever
in...
in
the
context
of
whether
there
would
be
residual
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
just
submitted.
the--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--yes.
yes,
ma'am.
there
had
been
a
similar
case
arising
out
of
chatham
county,
and
it
went
up
and
was
affirmed
per
curiam,
and
then
there
was
a
short
opinion
the
second
time
the
case
went...
went...
the
second
case
went
up,
and
there
was
a
very
short
opinion
in
regard
to
that,
taking
deference
to
their
decision
in
the...
in
the
first
opinion
and
talking
a
little
bit
about
the
residual
sovereign
immunity
issue
that
we
have
here.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
yes.
there
was
a
wickman
case
that...
that
was
several
years
ago
that
is
still
good
in
the
fifth,
and
our
circuit
adopted
that
when
they
put
in
the
new
circuit.
what
we're
asking
here
today
is
basically
a
very
narrow
holding.
we're
asking
that
there
be
limited
sovereign
immunity...
there...
excuse
me...
that
there
be...
in
unique
circumstances
where
core
functions
of
the
state
are
delegated
to
the
county,
that
the
county
would
have
sovereign
immunity,
and
that
a
state
can
cloak
a
county
with
sovereign
immunity.
it
seems
that
that
is
an
issue
that
the
state
ought
to
be
able
to
do
out
of
its
delegation...
out
of
its
dignity
function.
they
ought
to
have
the
right
to
run
the
state
and...
and
delegate
those
functions
as
they
see
fit.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
yes,
sir,
that's--
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
--i
don't
know
if
i'd
go
so
far
as
normal,
but
for
larger
communities,
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
jonathan
hart
well,
it's
a
function
that
historically
in
the
constitution
was
recognized
would
be
a
function
on
behalf
of
the
state
with
the
counties.
and...
and
it
has
traditionally
historically
been
a
function
of
the
states
to
build
roads
and
run
bridges.
and
in
regard
to
that,
you're
talking
about
navigable
waters,
and
the
state
has
an
interest
in
its
own
navigable
waters.
they're
delegating
a
function
of
the
government
to
build
a
bridge
over
their
navigable
waters
and
the
soils
thereunder.
so
we
would
take
the
position
there
that...
that
that
is
a
core
sovereign
function,
that
the
navigable
waters
are
a
sovereign
interest
of
the
state,
and
that
should
have
the
dignity
and
respect
of
that.
the
design
of
the
constitution
was
that
there
would
be
dual
sovereignty
created
both
in
federalism
and
under
state
sovereignty.
there's
not
a
single
case
you
all
are
going
to
have
that's
going
to
be
able
to
define
all
the
principles
of
general
sovereign
immunity,
but
we
think
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
court,
by
making
a
holding
in
in
personam
actions,
can
recognize
the
state's
residual
immunity,
not
so
much
focus
on
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
cases
thereunder,
but
try
to
come
up
with
a
set
of
principles
that
you
can
begin
talking
about
the
whole
of
general
sovereign
immunity.
and
we
do
not
necessarily
agree
that
the...
the
state...
the
arm
of
the
state
test
has
to
apply
in
all
situations.
we
think
this
is
an
exception.
it's
a
narrow
exception.
core
sovereign
functions
are
going
to
be
narrowly
defined,
especially
when
a
county
is
acting.
you're
going
to
have
to
support
it
with
some
history.
you're
going
to
have
to
support
it
with
some
state
dignity
where
the
state
has
given
a
clear
indication
through
their
state
laws
that
it's
a
function
that
the
county
ought
to
do,
and...
and
that
needs
to
be
respected
from
the
standpoints
that
states
are
given
wide
latitude
in
the
way
that
they
set
up
and
run
their
government.
and
we
respectfully
request
that
you
make
a
finding
that
we
have
the
right
to
have
sovereign
immunity
in
this
particular
narrow
set
of
circumstances
involving
navigable
waters
as...
as
it
stands.
thank
you.
