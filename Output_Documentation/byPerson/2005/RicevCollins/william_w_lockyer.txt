mr.
william
w.
lockyer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
repeatedly
communicated
an
understanding
of
the
appropriate
deference
owed
to
state
court
fact
finding
in
habeas
review
under
28
u.s.c.,
section
2254.
here,
we
don't
have
a
simple
case
of
the
ninth
circuit
applying
the
proper
standard
of
deference,
but
getting
the
wrong
result.
the
problem
is
the
ninth
circuit
doesn't
get
the
standard.
although--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--yes.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
none...
none
at
all,
justice
kennedy.
i
believe
we
provided
the--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--appendix
2--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
neither
of
us
have
any
objection,
and
it's
been
quoted
extensively--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--in...
in
the
briefs
as
well.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
thank
you,
mr.
kennedy...
justice
kennedy.
in
this
instance,
the
ninth
circuit
professes
fealty
to
aedpa
deference,
but
it
seems
simply
too
easy,
having
sensed
a
constitutional
injury,
to
become
willing
to
attribute
error
to
the
state
court
and
to
substitute
its
own
factual
inferences
for
those
of
the
trial
judge.
the
way
the
court
decides
this
case
can
provide
further
instruction
to
habeas
courts
to
help
them
avoid
the
ninth
circuit
error.
i'd
suggest
at
least
four
instructions
that
might
be
considered.
first,
confirming
that
the
objective
reasonableness
test,
that
inquiry
under
(d)(2),
is
like
that
currently
under
(d)(1).
that
is,
the
factual
inquiry,
like
that
under
the
legal
inquiry,
more
deferential
than
review
for
clear
error.
second,
since
it
seems
logical
that
state
fact
finding
should
be
entitled
to
equal,
if
not
greater,
respect
than
that
now
accorded
state
court
resolution
of
legal
issues
under
(d)(1),
we've
argued
for
adoption
of
the
jackson
v.
virginia
kind
of
standard
as
consistent
with
the
letter
and
spirit
of
aedpa,
meaning
that
witness
credibility
determinations
rarely
may
be
overturned,
and
that
all
of
the
evidence
must
be
reviewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
fact
finder.
third,
although
miller
el
v.
dretke
represented
an
extraordinarily
egregious
and
i
personally
think
undeniable
violation
of
batson,
some
might
react
to
a
whiff
of
a
little
smoke
as
a
miller
el
fire.
proper
resolution
of
this
case
can
make
it
clear
that
miller
el
v.
dretke
dealt
with
a
outlier
and
that
the
traditional
line
of
this
court's
habeas
cases,
restricting
federal
courts
from
second
guessing
a
state
judge's
credibility
calls,
retain
their
vitality.
finally
and
specifically
responding
to
mr.
collins'
argument
that
this
case,
it
seems,
is
an
opportunity
to
confirm
the
well
established
presumption
of
correctness
for
state
court
fact
finding
under
section
2254(e)(1),
that
it
remains
available
in
all
habeas
cases.
collins'
view
that
the
traditional
presumption
now
applies
only
in
the
rare
case
of
federal
evidentiary
hearings
would
eviscerate
the
traditional
presumption.
in
my
office--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
view
is
that
the
(e)(1)
test
really
focuses
on
specific
facts
that
have
been
found
in
state
court.
the
(d)(2)
focus
is
on
the
decision,
which
presumably
would
be
a
bundle
of
multiple
facts,
the
decision
of
the
court
and
whether
it
was
objectively
unreasonable.
and
to
limit
the
(e)(1)
presumption
not
only,
i
think,
being
contrary
to
congressional
intention
when
aedpa
reforms
were
adopted,
and
your
cases
that
have
applied
both
(e)(1)
and
(d)(2)
as
separate,
independent
tests...
in
my
office,
there
are
320
attorneys
that
do
federal
habeas
work,
120,000
hours
of
lawyering.
if
you
take
out
the
capital
cases,
the
non
capital
federal
habeas
claims,
only
2
or
3
percent
ever
go
to
a
federal
evidentiary
hearing.
so
the
result
of
reading
that
(e)(1)
without
the
presumption
in
the
cold
record
case
means
basically
the
state
loses
the
presumption
for
almost
every
habeas
claim
that
we
look
at.
so
it
would
seem
to
not
be
also
supported
by
the
statute's
clear
terms.
there's
no
limitation
written
into
(e)(1)
that
it...
it's...
doesn't
apply
across
the
board
to
all
habeas
claims.
the--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--mr.
chief
justice,
i...
i
think
that
reading
the
transcript
will
show
that
the
judge,
hearing
the
batson
motion,
asking
counsel
to
explain
the
reasons
for
her
strikes,
allowing
defense
counsel
to
comment
and
explain,
and
then
the
ruling
of
the
judge
seems
to
be
a
general
one,
both
contemplating
both
demeanor
and
youthfulness,
and
benefit
of
the
doubt
may
refer
back
to
the
fact
that
there's
a
dispute
about
the
challenged
juror
and
whether
she
turned
aside,
rolled
her
eyes
in
a
dismissive
and
disrespectful
way.
and
the
judge
says,
well,
i
didn't
see
that
behavior,
but
i'll
give
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
but
i
think
the
ruling
is
a
general
one
that
subsumes
both
claims,
youthfulness
and
demeanor.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
justice
kennedy,
that's
correct.
there
was
no
comment.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
well--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--well,
we
are
in
the
middle
of
a...
a
trial,
of
course,
and
it
happens
quickly
and,
as
the
court
has
suggested,
often
peremptory--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--yes,
sir.
however,
it
was
just
a
short
time
later
in
the
day,
justice
kennedy.
there
was
a
break
to
dismiss
the
jury
and
then
come
back
to
the
batson
claim.
but
the
peremptories,
as
the
court
has
frequently
said,
are
intuitive,
often
inarticulable.
in
this
case,
i
think
the--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--well,
i
think
that
happens.
that
is,
as
soon
as
the
prosecutor
is
asked
to
defend
her
challenge,
she
does,
and
she
talks
about
youthfulness.
she
says
the
young
person
doesn't
have
ties
in
the
community,
doesn't
have
a
stake
in
the
community,
is
unmarried,
perhaps
has
a
greater
tolerance
for
drug
crime
with
a
small
amount.
this
is
a
three
strikes
case.
it
would
be
a
natural
worry,
i
think,
for
a
district
attorney
to
think
that
a
third
strike,
even
though
one
and
two
were
armed
robbery
and
rape...
that
a
third
strike
that's
possession
of
a
small
amount
of
drugs,
you
might
need
to
worry
about
a
juror's
tolerance
or
worrying
about
that
severity
of
sentence.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
yes.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
well,
thank
you,
justice
souter.
first,
i'd
point
to
the
language
that
the
judge
provided,
which
was
in
regard
to
juror
16,
the
only
one
that
is
at
issue,
the
court
did
not
observe
the
demeanor.
however,
16
was
a
youthful
person,
as
was
6,
and
then
prepared
to
give
the
district
attorney
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
right.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
if
i
may,
justice
souter.
the
da
never
withdrew
the
youthful
claim.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
right.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
the
judge
has
to
find
that
it
was
not
a
racially
discriminatory
strike.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
justice
scalia,
your
direct--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--yes.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
well,
probably
not,
because
the
requirement
is
that
the
strike
be
intentionally
done.
that
is,
there's
an
intentionality.
if
it's
unconscious,
as
you
suggest,
justice
stevens,
i...
i
would
think
that
wouldn't
qualify.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
well,
there
might
be
a
pattern
over
time.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
yes.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
you
might
be
able
to
deduce
intent
from...
infer
it
from
a
variety
of
challenges.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
in
good
faith?
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
justice
stevens
and
scalia,
i
would
rely
on
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
determination
of
the
intention
of
the
district
attorney--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--i'd
be
inclined
to
say
yes.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
yes.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
justice
scalia--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
hope
to
brief
that
one
some
day,
but--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--but...
but
it's
a
good...
it's
a
good
question
even
though
i...
i
don't
think
it's
what's
happening
in
this
instance.
and
i
mostly
would
say
we
rely
on
the
trial
judge
who's
there--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--i...
i
believe
that's
clear
from
the
record.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
perhaps
an
explanation...
and,
again,
if
the
trial
judge
thought
it
was
reasonable...
is
there
some
compelling
reason
to
read
it
a
different
way
years
later
on
appeal
after
the
california
court
of
appeal,
a
federal
magistrate,
and
a
federal
district
judge
have
agreed
with
the
trial
judge's
perspectives.
but
it
could
be
that
she
is
quoting,
as
you'll
see
in
the
transcript,
california
law
that
had
talked
about
jury
balances.
it's
good
to
have
young
and
old.
it's
good
to
have
different
races.
i
agree.
you're
absolutely
right.
j.e.b.
v.
alabama
had
occurred
a
couple
of
years
before,
and
the
judge
does
say,
i
don't
see,
ms.
satriano,
that
you
are
seeking
to
justify
excusing
people
of
one
ethnicity
based
on
gender.
so
he
seemed
to
at
least
be
saying,
you
started
with
youth.
everything
you
said
about
youth,
ties
in
the
community,
tolerance
for
drug
use,
unmarried,
which
might
be
distinctions
with
other
young
people...
those...
do
you
have
anything
else
to
say?
and
i...
i
suspect
she
felt
like
compelled
to
come
up
with
some
further
explanation.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
okay.
yes.
during
the
judicial
voir
dire.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
and--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--the
district
attorney
simply
says
with
one
of
the
questions
to
which
you...
the
prospective--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--it's
unclear.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
no,
you're
right.
i
mean,
it's
one
where...
it
doesn't
say
in
the
record
eye
rolling.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
it...
it
seems
to
be
where
the
juror
said
yes
in
response
to
the
voir
dire,
and
then--
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
--turned
aside.
all
we
know
is
yes
was
said.
we
don't
know
what
the
question
was.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
the...
a
point
i
guess
to
be
made
about
this
confusing
transcript...
and
of
course,
i
don't
know
what
the
file
looked
like
with
respect
to
miller
el,
but
this
is
it.
obviously,
there's
not
a
lot
to
go
on,
and
i
think
it
suggests
how
vital
it
is
to
rely
on
the
trial
court
judge
to
make
some
credibility
determination.
he's
there
and
sees
the
district
attorney
and
tries
to,
after
making
appropriate
inquiries,
say
that
he
accepts
her
non
racial
reason.
counsel
for
respondent
does
a
lot
to
compare
to
miller
el
and
so
perhaps
it's
worth
just
distinguishing
briefly.
there
we
have
10
of
11
african
american
jurors
struck.
we
have
the
lawyers
doing
the
questioning,
trick
questions,
loaded
questions,
complicated
questions.
we
have
the
external
evidence
of
the
dallas
manual
recommending
discriminatory
strikes.
we
have
the
cards
with
race
written
on
them.
here,
we
have
a
very
brief,
quick
proceeding.
the
judge
is
asking
the
questions
and
really
resisting
lawyers'
attempts
to
add
to
that,
to
get
more
information
so
you
can
make
a
valid
assessment
of
the
juror
that's
before
you.
and
so
in
this
instance,
obviously,
relying
on
intuition,
trial
experience,
she
exercises
the
two
peremptory
challenges,
one
of
which
was
withdrawn
on
appeal
and
not
pursued,
the
other
with
respect
to
the
young
person,
the
demeanor,
and
youthfulness
are
the
grounds
given.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
yes.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
we
tried
to
research
it,
justice
stevens,
and
we
believe
that
it
was
a...
a
state
court
rule
adopted
subsequent
to
wheeler.
and
that...
of
course,
unlike
the
way
in
which
it
is
characterized
in
respondent's
brief,
it
wasn't
a
warning
to
her,
the
district
attorney,
that
is.
it
was
a
general
statement.
if
there's
a
batson
claim,
i'm
obligated
to
report.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
well,
i
know
that's
your
view,
justice
breyer.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
i
prefer
to
keep
the
tradition
and
allow
the
peremptory
challenges.
thank
you.
i'll
reserve
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
with
respect
to
juror
19,
i
think
it's
the
best
clear
way
to
see
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
and
what
collins
continues
to
do,
which
is
to
substitute
their
reading,
their
inferences,
and
then
conclude
that
anyone
that
disagrees
is
unreasonable.
juror
19...
if
you
read
page
5,
it's
clearly
a
slip
of
the
tongue
where
she
accidentally
is
comparing
the
two
young
people,
6,
and
says
19.
immediately
afterward,
she
says
6.
and
the
defense
counsel
says,
well,
who
is
6?
she
says,
it's
the
other
young
person,
the
young
white
person
that
i
struck.
that
slip
of
the
tongue
is
the
heart
of
the
ninth
circuit
effort
and
analysis
to
do,
as
the
dissenters
said
in
the
en
banc
denial,
nitpick
the
record
to
find
some
circumstantial
evidence
to
support
your
view
of
inferences
and
conclusions
about
reasonableness.
i
think
that
partly
makes
the
case
and
especially
with
a
statute
where
deference
is
so
owed.
the
gender
claim
is
ambiguous,
but
it
was
not
a
challenge
based
solely
on
race
and
the
circuits
are
split
on
the
mixed
motive
question,
as
justice
stevens
indicated.
second,
third,
fourth,
eighth,
and
eleventh,
and
in
one
opinion
in
the
ninth,
they've
addressed
mixed
motives
generally
saying
your
clearly
established
federal
law
says
that
it
has
to
be
solely
based
on
race.
that's
the
current
test
in
the
standard.
we
raised
jackson
and...
jackson
v.
virginia
just
because
of
the
lockyer
v.
andrade
case
in
which
the
court
indicates
that
clear
error,
when
we
talk
about
objective
reasonableness
in
understanding
(d)(2)
and
(d)(1)
in
the
case
of
andrade,
that
it's
more
than
clear
error.
so
we're
trying
to
figure
out,
well,
what's
more
than
clear
error.
we
don't
know
what
it
might
be
other
than
seeing
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
trier
of
fact.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
youth,
clearly
it's
reasonable
for
a
judge
to
look
at
the
demeanor
of
the
da
who's
saying
again
and
again
and
again
it's
a
young
person,
unmarried,
no
ties
in
the
community.
one
of
the
things
we
didn't
talk
about
is
the
da
who's
from
los
angeles
knows
that
that
juror
lives
in
inglewood.
now,
there
are
different
kind
of
neighborhoods
in
inglewood,
but
a
lot
of
them
are
neighborhoods
with
lots
of
drug
dealing,
and
he
might
think
or
she
might
think,
in
this
instance,
it
shows
naivete
to
answer
the
question
that
there's
never
drug
dealing
in
my
neighborhood.
well,
for
all
those
concerns,
they're
not
implausible,
they're
not
fantastic,
as
you
know
from
the
decisions
that
the
reasons
can
be
superstitious.
they
can
be
silly.
mr.
william
w.
lockyer
well,
they're
just
the
ones
in
the
record,
your
honor.
so
i
wanted
to
make
sure
the
court
was
aware
of
them.
but
that's
basically
our
contention,
that
deference
was
owed
and
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
respect
that
deference
to
trial
judge
that
we
rely
on
for
credibility
determinations.
if
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
