justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
general?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
really
two
kinds
of
batson
problems
as
i
see
it.
there
are
some
cases
where
the
prosecutor
is...
just
is
deliberately
keeping
african
americans
off
the
jury,
and
there...
there's
no
question
there's
a
violation
there.
but
i'm
wondering
if
there
isn't
another
category
where
persons
are
unconscious
of
their
own
subconscious
bias
and
not
realizing
that
they
themselves
have
an
unconscious
fear
that
perhaps
an
african
american
might
not
be
a
sympathetic
juror.
would
that
kind
of
failure
to
really
identify
the
problem
within
the
prosecutor's
own
conception
of
the
case...
would
that
be
a
batson
violation
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if,
for
example,
the
judge
saw
that
over
a
period
of
time,
a
particular
prosecutor
had
hunches
about
jurors
over
and
over
again
and
they
just
happened
to
be
black
most
of
the
time.
that
would
not
justify
a...
a
batson
challenge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
she's
totally
convinced
of
the
good
faith
of
the
prosecutor.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
bad
faith.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
just
realizes
this
person
has
an
unconscious
bias
that
shows
up
in
the...
in
the
pattern
of
challenges.
would
that
be
a
justified
challenge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
trial
judge
determined--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--based...
based
on
the
history
of
several
trials
and
so
forth,
that
this
prosecutor
unconsciously
had
this
hunch
with
respect
to
black
jurors
but
not
others,
that
would
be
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
challenge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
in
this
very
case,
one
gets
the
impression
that
the
prosecutor
was
pretty
confused,
but
maybe
she
was
acting
in
good
faith.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
a...
kind
of
a
background
question?
i
noticed
the
judge
pointed
out
after
ruling
that
he
was
under...
he...
i
can't
remember
if
it
was
a
he
or
a
she,
but
was
under
an
obligation
to
report
its
reasons
for
granting
a
wheeler
motion
to
the
state
bar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that...
does
that
requirement
apply
after
the
ninth
circuit
decision?
is
there
a
requirement
that
the...
the
lawyer
be
investigated
for
possible
discipline?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you,
by
any
means...
you
don't
contend,
though,
the
fact
that
she
did
rely,
in
part,
on
an
unconstitutional
reason
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
sustaining
a
batson
type
challenge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
have
not
argued
that
that
would
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
setting
aside
the
verdict.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
have
had
merit
if
you
had
made
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you're
coming
up
with
still
more
reasons
than
the
prosecutor
came
up
with.
