we'll
hear
argument
next
in
rice
v.
collins.
general
lockyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
is...
it
is
a
little
unusual
to
have
under
your
view
two
different
sections,
both
addressed
to
the
question
of
the
appropriate
standard
of
review
in
a
particular
type
of
proceeding.
they
seem
either
redundant
or
overlapping.
the
theory
on
the
other
side
at
least
distinguishes
them
and
argues
that
they
apply
in
different
circumstances.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
contention
in
the
particular
proceeding
that
the
district
court...
or
the
state
fact
finder
did
not,
in
fact,
make
a
determination,
but
simply
gave
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
i
frankly
didn't
read
it
that
way.
it
just
seemed
to
be
he
was
stating
the
fact,
that
it
would
be
an
obligation
to
report.
clearly,
it
has
some
impact
on
how
people
feel
about
the
judicial
system
and
the
particular
lawyer's
reputation
if
the
judge
were
to
affirm
the
motion.
but
i...
i
would
expect
the
judge
was
doing
his
job
and
performing
his
duties
correctly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
drozdowski,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
the
rolling
of
the
eyes
a
persuasive
reason?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
isn't
this
just
another
way
of
saying
you
don't
believe
the
proffered
justification?
in
other
words,
the...
the
trial
judge
made
a
credibility
determination
that
that
was
the
reason,
the
person
rolled
her
eyes,
and
you're
saying,
in
light
of
the
other
explanations,
you
think
the
prosecutor
is
just
making
that
up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
saying
you
don't
believe
it.
you
think
there's
a
different
reason,
and
the
rolling
the
eyes
is
not
the
real
reason.
and
we
have
a
factual
determination
that
the
judge
believes
that
that's
the
reason
or
a
reason.
and
under
the...
the
statute,
at
least
that...
that's...
that
either
has
to
be
shown
to
be
unreasonable
or,
under
the
state's
reason,
that's
presumed
to
be
correct,
and
you
have
to
show
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
would
say
you've
established
that
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
juror
19...
you
just
said
earlier
the
fact
that
the
one
juror's
uncle
had
an
alcohol
problem
was...
was
a
legitimate
factor.
juror
19's
daughter
had
a...
a
cocaine
problem
and
this
was
a
cocaine
case.
isn't
that
a
perfectly
legitimate
reason
for
exercising
a
peremptory
with
respect
to
a
juror?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
i'm...
what...
what
is
the
inference
you
try
to
draw
from
the
treatment
of
juror
19?
that
the
prosecutor
wants
to...
was
striking
people
on
the
basis
of
their
race
or
that
she
had
better
reasons
for
19
than
16?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
then
what
do
you
do
with
the
fact
that
juror
19's
daughter
had
a
cocaine
problem
and
this
was
a
cocaine
case?
that
doesn't
seem
to
be...
that's
not
a
race
based
reason.
that's
seems
to
me
to
be
a
good
reason.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
the
argument
that
your
reading
of
the
two
sections
means
that
(e)(1)
would
only
apply
in
a
very
small
number
of
cases,
and
it's
obvious
that
congress
was
trying
to
tighten
the
habeas
review
procedures?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
lockyer,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
in
no.
