justice
antonin
scalia
general,
does...
does
the
judge
have
to
find
what
the
reason
for
the
strike
was,
or
does
the
judge
have
to
find
what
the
reason
for
the
strike
wasn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
there
are
several
allegations
and...
and
each
of
them
is
somewhat
doubtful
but,
on
balance,
he
says,
i
give
the
benefit
of
the...
of
the
doubt
to
the...
to
the
district
attorney,
it's
his
indication
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
finds
that
the
reason
wasn't
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
you
have
to
accept
his
hypothetical
as
he
gave
it.
assuming
that
the
attorney,
the
district
attorney,
was
in
good
faith.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
assuming
that
the...
the
attorney
did
not
think
that
he
or
she
was
striking
the
juror
because
of
the
juror's
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
gives
a
lot
of
power
to
district...
to...
to
the
district
judge,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
you
know,
this...
he
says
this...
this
u.s.
attorney
really
doesn't
honestly
believe
that
he's
biased,
but
i
think,
being
the
great
psychologist
that
i
am,
that
this
united
states
attorney,
or
whoever,
is...
is
really
biased
and...
and
he's...
i...
you
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
really
want
the
system
to
run
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
there...
there's
no
doubt
that
the
court...
or
at
least
in
my
mind,
that...
that
the
trial
court
could
have
come
out
the
other
way.
i...
i...
you
know,
all
of
the
things
you
say
are
quite
true.
the
question
is
whether
the
trial
court
had
to
come
out
the
other
way,
whether
it
was
just
utterly
unreasonable
for
the
trial
court
to
come
out
the
way
it
did.
and
that...
you
know,
that's
a...
that's
a
heavy
burden.
and...
and
it
is
a
messy
transcript
and
all
of
that,
but
i...
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
how...
how
you
can
establish
that...
not
only
that...
that
the
trial
court
could
have
come
out
the
other
way
or,
indeed,
maybe
in
your
judgment,
maybe
in
my
judgment,
should
have
come
out
the
other
way.
but
you
have
to
establish
that
it's
unreasonable
not
to
come
out
the
other
way.
and...
and
i
find
it
hard
to...
to
see
how
you
can
do
that
when
you
have
a
transcript
that
relies,
in
part,
upon
the...
you
know,
the
rolling
of
the
eyes
and
the...
and
the
trial
court
says,
i'm...
i'm
willing
to
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
that
that's
the
reason
she
did
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
prosecutor
presumably
appears
before
this
judge
on
other
occasions,
and...
and
don't
you
think
we...
we
can
give
some
weight
to
the
fact
that
the
judge
is
there,
sees
the
woman,
sees
what
she's
saying,
and...
and
can
judge
better
than
we
can
whether
she's
making
this
up
or
just...
just
is...
is
somewhat
confused,
especially
since,
as...
as
i
think
the
general
pointed
out,
we're
dealing
with
a
kind
of
determination
that
is
usually
instinctive
on
the
part
of
trial
counsel.
there's
just
something
about
this,
you
know,
and
you
move
to
strike.
i'm
not
sure
it
springs
into
your
mind,
at
the
time
you...
you
move
to
strike,
the
precise
reason.
then
somebody
asks
you
later,
why
was
it?
why
was
it?
there
was
just
something
about
that
person
i
didn't
like.
i
know
it
wasn't
the
race.
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
now,
what
was
it?
and
then...
then
you
have
to
recreate
a...
a
rational
process
that,
in
fact,
never
occurred.
it
was
an
instinctive
process
more
than
a
rational
one.
so
i'm...
i'm
not
particularly
upset
by...
by
seeing
counsel
flounder
about
in...
in
trying
to
come
up
with
what
the
right
reason
was.
i
think
it's
probably
pretty
hard
to
figure
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
that
it's
hard.
that's
all.
and...
and
that
you
can
understand
why
somebody
would
flop
around
because,
at
the
time
the
strike
is
made,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
it's
always
an
entirely
rational
rather
than
instinctive
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
(d)(2)
or
(e)(1)
is
the...
is
the
stricter
requirement?
i'm
really
not
sure
which
of
the
two.
don't
you
think
it...
it
might
be
possible
to
show,
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
that
the
state
court
decision
was...
factual
decision
was
wrong,
but
you,
nonetheless,
do
not
show
that
it
was
unreasonable?
in
other
words,
it
may
well
be
that
(d)(2)
is...
is
the
more
severe
one.
