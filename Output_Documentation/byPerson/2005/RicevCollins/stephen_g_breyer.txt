justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
the...
where...
where
is
the
place
in
what
the
judge...
when
did
this
eye
rolling
take
place?
i
can't
figure
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
have
that
in
front
of
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
the
statement
that
the
judge
made
in
respect
to
which
the
juror
is
supposed
to
have
rolled
her
eyes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
reason
i
can't
find
it
out
is
none
of
us
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
actually
says
it
wasn't
a
question.
it
was
a
statement,
and
that's
why
i
can't
figure
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
was
a
question
you
said--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
have
a
minute,
you
might...
i
don't
know
if
you...
if
this
is
very
useful.
but
i've
taken
this
point
of
view
that...
that
there's
no
way
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
use
of
stereotypes
in
cases
like
this,
a
perfect
example.
and
therefore,
the
only
thing
to
do,
consistent
with
the
constitution,
is
no
peremptories.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
30
seconds.
do
you
want
to
say
how
irresponsible
that
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
the
point.
the
judge
says,
i'll
give
the
prosecution
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
well,
he...
he
knows
the
prosecutor
and
he
believes
the
prosecutor.
i
didn't
see
it,
but
i'll
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
he
told
me
that's
what
she
did.
what's...
i
mean,
i
really
don't
see
why
that
isn't,
given
the
present
law,
sufficient.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
benefit
of
the
doubt
just
refers
to
youth.
i...
i
read
that
as
referring
to
the
whole
story.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i...
it's
pretty
hard
to
read
that
as
saying,
i'll
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
respect
to
the
youth.
it
sounds
as
if
i'll
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
respect
to
the
reasons
he
gave
for
challenging
her.
there
are
two
other
african
american
jurors
on
the
jury.
she
is
useful...
youthful.
he...
she
saw
him...
he
saw
her
rolling
her
eyes
when...
what
do
you
think
about
the
drugs
or
some
other
relevant
question.
and
he
says,
i'll
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
to
read
that
in
a
way
that...
that
comes
out
the
way
you
want
it
to
come
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
tell
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
the
remedy...
the
remedy
if
we
say
and
hold
with
you
that
prosecutors
can't
give
reasons
like
they
gave
here?
how
is
a...
what's
a
prosecutor
supposed
to
do?
i
mean,
the
prosecutor
might
be
moved
by
stereotype.
young
african
american
woman...
of
course,
she
tolerates
drugs.
well,
not
quite
of
course.
well...
well...
well,
she
rolled
her
eyes.
well,
at
least
she
looked
in
this
direction.
well,
i
sort
of...
maybe
i'm
seeing
eye
rolling
here.
i
mean,
we
all
understand
that.
but
that's
why
i
guess
i
am
where
i
am.
i...
i
don't
see
what
the...
i
don't
see
what
we're
telling
prosecutors
if
we
hold
in
your
favor,
and
i
don't
see
how
we
deal
with
the
problem
if
we
hold
against
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
asking
for
your
experience.
you
have
a
lot
of
experience
as
a
defense
lawyer.
how
is
this
thing
supposed
to
work?
