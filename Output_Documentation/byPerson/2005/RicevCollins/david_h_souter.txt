justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
youthfulness--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but...
but
isn't...
isn't
the
difficulty
with
your
analysis
there,
general,
that,
yes,
she
started
out
by...
by
talking
about
youthfulness.
as
i
understand
it,
she
started
talking
about
youthfulness
and
the...
and
the
demeanor,
the
rolling
of
the
eyes.
justice
david
h.
souter
sort
of
at
the
second
stage,
again
she
spoke
of
youthfulness.
then
at
a
third
stage,
she
said,
well,
it's
a
combination
of...
of
age,
gender,
and
inexperience.
then
she
realized
she
was
in
trouble,
and
she
said,
well,
i
really
didn't
mean
gender
because
i...
i'd
be
in
constitutional
hot
water
there.
then
she
said,
well,
i
really
don't
mean
age
because
there
are
other
young
people
on
the
jury,
and
i'm...
i'm
not
challenging
them.
so
that
the
only
thing
that
was
left
was
possibly
that
element
of
age
which
refers
to
ties
to
the
community.
and
at
the
end
of
this
long
colloquy,
in
which
she
has
gone
back
and
forth
and
back
and
forth
and...
and
jettisoned
some
of
her
reasons,
the
trial
judge
says,
well,
i
didn't
see
the
eye
rolling,
and
i
guess
i'll
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
counsel.
i
don't
know
whether
the
judge
is
talking
about
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
eye
rolling
or
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on...
on
ties
to
the
community.
assuming
it's
ties
to
the
community,
that
has
nothing
to
do,
i
suppose,
with...
with
the...
the
fear
that
a
young
person
is
going
to
be
too
sympathetic
to
a
defendant
who's
up
for
the
third
time
with
a
small
amount
of
drugs.
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
what
justice
kennedy's
question
in
the
first
place
suggested.
we
simply
have
an
incoherent
colloquy
and
a
response
to
the
judge
which
simply
does
not
tell
you
what
the
judge
is
ruling
on
or
the
basis
for
the
ruling.
all
we
know
is
that
ultimately
he's
saying
i'm
rejecting
the
batson
challenge.
that's
the
problem
with...
with
deference
in
this
case.
what...
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
district
attorney
has...
i
mean,
the...
the
point
here
is
we're
judging
the
district
attorney's
responses,
not
the
judge's
responses.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
we
want
to
know
is
what
the
judge
found
and
ruled
upon.
the
district
attorney,
as
i
understand
it,
has
withdrawn
the
general
claim
that
youthfulness
is
a
problem,
and
the
only
claim
that
might
have
been...
might...
probably
was
comprehended
under
youth
that...
that
remains
is
the
claim
of
no
community
ties.
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
tell
from
the
judge's
ruling
whether
the
judge
is
saying,
yes,
i
think
there's
a
fair
showing
that
there
are
no
community
ties
and
that's
certainly
a
race
neutral
reason.
i
don't
know
what
the
judge
was...
was--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
didn't
the
da
say,
look,
youth
alone
doesn't...
doesn't
explain
my
reasons
because
there
are
other
young
people
on
the
jury
that...
that
we're
not
challenging,
and...
and
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
all
young
people
should
be
disqualified?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
as
a...
as
a
response
to...
to
the
kind
of
the
incoherent
flopping
around
argument,
let
me
ask
you
what
your
position
would
be
if
the
record
were
different
in
the
following
respect.
let's
assume
the
record
is
just
what
it
is
up
until
that
final
paragraph
or
so
in
which
the
judge
rules.
and
instead
of
doing
what
he
did
in
this
case,
the
judge
says
the
following
two
things.
he
says,
number
one,
i
didn't
see
the
eye
rolling,
but
i
accept
counsel's
representation
of
fact
that
the
eye
rolling
went
on
and
i
certainly
understand
the...
the
significance
of
that.
so
i'm
going
to
take
that
as
a
fact.
number
two,
even
though
counsel
has
withdrawn
the...
the
sort
of
the
general
claim
of
youth
and
so
on,
i
understand
counsel
still
to
be
saying
this
is
a
person
without
any
manifest
ties
to
the
community
and...
and
that
suggests
a
certain
looseness
of
responsibility.
and
based
upon
the
eye
rolling
and
based
upon
the
lack
of
ties
to
the
community,
i
think
counsel
had
a
race
neutral
basis
for
the...
for
the
strike
that
was
made,
and
for
that
reason,
i'm
going
to
overrule
the
batson
challenge
with
respect
to
number
16.
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
would
say
that
those
two
conclusions
on
the
part
of
the
court
were
unreasonable?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
this
one
rolled
her
eyes.
