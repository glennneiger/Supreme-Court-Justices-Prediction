justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
no
such...
that...
that's
very
far
from
this
case,
general
lockyer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
did...
i
did
have
one--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
we...
can
we
go
back--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--she
was
certainly...
she
was
certainly
wrong
on
the
law.
when
she...
when
the
gender
question
came
up,
she
said,
well,
it's
not
a
suspect
category,
and
she
seemed
to
be...
her
notion
was
that
it
was
okay
to
aim
for
a
jury
that
had
an
equal
number
of
men
and
women.
and
it
was...
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
age
too.
i
agree
with
you
she
didn't
withdraw
it,
but
was...
the
reasonable
explanation
was
we
don't
want
too
many
young
people
here.
so
i'm
going
to
allow
some,
but
i
want
older
people
to
dominate.
but
the
gender...
she
had
to
be
told
by
the
judge
batson
applies
to
gender.
that...
that
seemed...
that
seemed
strange
to
me
that...
that
2
years
after,
she
would
not
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the...
on
the...
on
the
eye
roll,
which
i
thought
also
the...
the
prosecutor
said
that
she
turned
her
head.
so
it
may
be
that
she
was
out
of
the
vision
of
the...
the
judge
even
if
he
had
been
looking.
i
don't
see
that
you
have
any
evidence
to
rebut
it.
you
said,
well,
it
was
rebutted
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
there
was
no
evidence.
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
another...
another.
wasn't
there
another
minority
woman
on
the...
in
the
jury
panel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
she
might
in
the
future,
if
she's
got
a
job
as
a
prosecutor
in
this
court.
so
she's
certainly
going
to
be
concerned
with
her
reputation,
her
integrity
before
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
wrong
with
the
explanation,
as
far
as
youth
is
concerned,
is
that
she
didn't
want
to
across
the
board
strike
young
people,
but
she
just
wanted
to
come
up
with
a
jury
that
had
dominantly
older
people.
so
that
wouldn't
mean
that
she's
withdrawing
youth.
it's
just
that
she's
saying
it
isn't
an
absolute
with
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what's...
one...
one
point
could
be
i
don't
want
too
many
young
people,
so
i'm
going
to
exercise
some
peremptories
to
make
sure
that
the
jury
is
dominantly
older
people.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
she
did.
number
6
was
white.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
youth
was
a
factor
there.
there
may
have
been
other
factors,
but
youth
was
certainly
a
factor
in
that
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that...
that
was
so
obviously
a
slip,
and
judge
hall
pointed
that
out
in
her
dissent.
defense
counsel
too
confused...
was
confused
on
the
numbers.
obviously,
it...
the...
the
prosecutor
wasn't
trying
to
say
a
grandmother
is
going
to
be
excused...
is
going
to
be
struck
because
she's
young.
