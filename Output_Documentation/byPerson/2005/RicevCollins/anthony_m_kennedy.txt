justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
at
the...
at
the
outset...
and
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
you're
prepared
for
this,
but
the
joint
appendix,
volume
2,
is
under
seal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
i
think
we'd
be
very
interested
in
knowing
about
the
colloquy
that
the
trial
judge
had
with
the
attorneys,
and
if
it's
under
seal,
it's
a
little
bit
awkward
to
do
that.
is
there
any
reason
that
it
has
to
be
kept
under
seal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
take
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
take
it
that
the...
the
names
of
the
jurors
we
don't
know
because
they're
given
numbers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
far
as
you
know,
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
would
also
have
no
objection?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
it
was
then
quoted
extensively
in
the
ninth
circuit
i
thought.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
i
noticed
the
defense
attorney,
respondent
here,
did
not
comment
in
any
way
on
the...
the
demeanor
of
the...
of
witness
16,
which
means
either
the...
he...
he
saw
it
and
said
nothing
or
he...
he
didn't
see
it
at
all.
we
don't
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
is
the
obligation
that
we
impose
on
the
prosecution
in
this
case
to
give
a
coherent
explanation
of
why
there...
the
juror
was
excused?
that
step
has
proceeded.
we're
at
that
step
in
batson
where
an
explanation
has
to
be
given.
what...
what
have
we
said
about
how
coherent
and
complete
that
explanation
has
to
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
here,
it
seems
that
the
prosecutor
was
somewhat
caught
off
guard
or...
or
certainly
was
not
extremely
clear.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
quickly.
they
gave
notice
that
there'd
be
a
batson
hearing.
she
should
have
known
what's
going
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
point
is
once
there's
a
batson
challenge,
it
has
to
be
articulated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
would
he--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i...
i
read
it
as
saying,
and
therefore
i'm
going
to
be
careful
about
finding
that
there's
been
a
batson
violation.
and
i
wonder
if
that's
consistent
with
what
we
want
trial
judges
to
do
when
they're
hearing
batson
challenges.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what...
what
should
happen
if
the
trial
judge
doesn't
see
it
and
a
counsel,
who's
observant,
said,
judge,
i've
got
a
problem
with
this
juror?
i
don't
know
that
the
trial
judge
has
to...
has
to
see
it,
if
he
believes
the
counsel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we've...
we've
all
been...
been
in
court
and...
and
noticed
that
sometimes
witnesses
or
jurors
or
parties
or
even
attorneys
will
make
faces
and
so
forth
that's
not
consistent
with...
with
proper
demeanor
in
a
courtroom.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maybe
the
judge
is
reading.
a
judge
doesn't
watch...
watch
the
witness
100
percent
of
the
time.
that's
not
credible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now...
now,
number
19
was
excused
and
was
a
black
person.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
a
woman.
and
if
that
too
had
been
suspicious
and
challenged,
then
you
might
have
had
a
pattern,
a
pattern
of
two
people,
which
could
have
overcome
the
demeanor
testimony...
demeanor
claim.
but
i...
i
think
on
this
record
that
we
have
to
assume
that
there
is
nothing
wrongful
about
excusing
juror
19
merely
because
respondent's
counsel
here...
you
did
not
pursue
that.
i...
i
read
the
record
as...
as
telling
us
that
so
far
as
juror
19
is
concerned,
there
was
an
adequate
reason
for
excusing
that
juror.
at
least
respondent's
counsel...
you
have
not
said
that
there
wasn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
number
6
was
a
young
white...
young
white
male,
i
believe,
and
he
was
excused
on
the
ground
of
youth.
so
it's
consistent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
defense
counsel
confusing
jurors
16
and
19
at
page
9,
the
bottom
of
page
9?
it
seems
to
me
ms....
ms.
nachman
is
confusing
juror
19
with
16.
they're
talking
about
16
and
6,
and
then
ms.
nachman
ends
by
talking
about
juror
19.
that
seems
to
me
clearly
to
mean
number
16.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
don't
think
it's
a
necessary
reading.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
in
a
sense,
the
standards
perhaps
ought
to
be
reversed.
when
you
hear
the
evidence,
which
is
what
you
do
under
(e)(1),
that
is
when
you've
determined...
should
determine
whether
it's
unreasonable.
you
should
presume
that
it's
correct
before
you
decide
whether
you're
going
to
hear.
so
you
could
argue
that
they
should
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if...
if
i
might
ask.
you
have
no
objection
to
our
unsealing
the
joint
appendix,
volume
2.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
batson
versus
kentucky,
a
decision
decided
by
this
court
in
1986,
it
was
established
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
a
prosecutor
to
strike
a
prospective
juror
based
on
that
juror’s
race.
a
batson
challenge,
in
that
case
and
in
subsequent
cases
as
it
has
developed,
entails
a
three-step
process:
first,
the
trial
court
must
decide
whether
there
is
a
prima
facie
showing
of
discrimination;
second,
if
so,
the
prosecutor
must
provide
a
race-neutral
explanation;
and,
third,
the
court
then
must
determine
whether
the
defendant
has
carried
the
burden
of
proving
purposeful
discrimination.
collins
is
the
respondent
in
this
case.
he
was
on
trial
for
criminal
charges
in
a
california
state
court,
the
superior
court
for
the
state
of
california,
in
and
for
the
county
of
los
angeles.
after
the
prosecutor
used
her
second
peremptory
strike
on
an
african-american
woman,
defense
counsel
made
a
batson
objection.
the
trial
court,
satisfied
with
the
prima
facie
step,
went
on
to
step
2
and
it
asked
the
prosecutor
to
explain
the
basis
for
the
challenge.
the
prosecutor
said
she
was
concerned
that
the
juror
was
young
and
likely
to
be
lenient
on
drug
offenses;
lacks
ties
to
the
community;
and
had
rolled
her
eyes
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
court.
the
prosecutor
also
indicated
she
was
seeking
gender
balance
in
the
jury.
the
trial
court
had
to
go
then
to
step
3
and
determine
if
there
was
racial
discrimination.
the
trial
court
disallowed
or
discredited
the
prosecutor’s
use
of
gender.
it
did
credit
the
prosecutor’s
other
explanations,
even
though
it
had
not
seen
the
juror’s
troubling
behavior,
and
the
california
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
ruling.
after
his
conviction,
the
respondent
filed
a
federal
petition
of
habeas
corpus,
which
the
district
court
denied.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
credit
the
prosecutor’s
explanations.
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996,
federal
habeas-corpus
courts
may
overturn
state
court
factual
findings
only
if
there
are
unreasonable
determinations
in
light
of
the
evidence
presented
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
although
the
court
of
appeals
invoked
this
standard,
we
concluded
it
improperly
substituted
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
state
court.
the
court
of
appeals
held
any
reasonable
fact
finder
would
have
disregarded
the
prosecutor’s
rendition
of
events.
in
our
view,
the
record
does
not
support
this
conclusion.
reasonable
minds
reviewing
the
record
might
disagree
about
the
prosecutor’s
credibility;
but
on
habeas
review,
that
does
not
suffice
to
supersede
the
state
court’s
judgment
on
that
issue.
in
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
we
are
unanimous;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
