mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
properly
held
that
the
state
appellate
court
decision
represented
an
unreasonable
determination
of
facts
because
the
prosecutor
did
not
give
a
single
persuasive
reason
for
striking
juror
16.
the
circuit
also
rightly
held
that
the--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--well,
here
the
rolling
of
the
eyes,
first,
is
uncorroborated
by
the
trial
judge.
he
says,
quite
frankly,
i
did
not
see
it.
and
in
his
ruling,
he
does
not
credit
that
rationale.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
that
could
be,
but
here
the
trial
court's--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--that's
correct.
but
what's
significant
here
is
that
this
was
a
judge
conducted
voir
dire
where
juror
16
would
have
been
facing
the
judge
when
giving
her
answer.
so
the
judge
would
have
been
in
the
best
position
to
see
the--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--as
the
court
has
previously
mentioned,
what
we
also
have
here
is
there's
no...
there's
no
corroboration
in
the
transcript
that
juror--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--well,
here,
the
trial
court's
ruling...
he
says,
i
did
not
see
the
demeanor
complained
of.
however,
juror
16
is
youthful,
as
are
other
jurors.
i'm
prepared
to
give
the
district
attorney
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
so
i
think
the
ruling
here,
if
there
is,
indeed,
a
finding
of
no
discrimination,
would
be
limited
to
the
youth
rationale
clearly
by--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--well--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--well...
well,
even--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--okay.
even
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
trial
judge
did
credit
the
demeanor
rationale,
it's
still
a
wholly
unpersuasive
reason
to
give
in
light
of
everything
else
the
prosecutor
did
here.
the
demeanor
rationale
wasn't
the
sole
reason
given.
it
comes
as
part
of
a
litany
of
reasons
that
are
all
either
unconstitutional,
the
gender
rationale,
or
contradictory
or
unsupported
by
the
record.
and
there
was
some
discussion
earlier
about
this.
miller
el
makes
clear
that
the
district
attorney
must
give
the
real
reason
for
the
strike,
not
just
any
rational
basis
the
prosecutor
can
think
up.
and
when
we
look
at
the
transcript
of
the
batson
hearing
here,
we
see
a
prosecutor
scrambling
to
think
of
anything
she--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--i...
i
think
two
things.
i
think,
one,
the
reasonable
conclusion
is
the
prosecutor
is
making
it
up,
but
even
if
the
court...
the
court
doesn't
need
to
accept
that
to
still
come
to
the
conclusion
and
say
the
demeanor
rationale
is
still
not
the
reason
for
the
strike.
she
can't
say
the
reason
here.
she
comes
up
with
six
different
reasons,
but
they're
all
either--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--and
the
ninth
circuit
properly
found
that
the
conclusion
was
both
unreasonable
and
rebutted
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
it's
because
none
of
these
reasons,
when
we
look
at
the
totality...
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--well,
we
cited
a
case
on
page
24
in
our
brief,
a
third
circuit
case,
riley,
that
says
a
reviewing
court's
suspicion
may
be
raised
by
a
series
of
very
weak
explanations
given
for
the
strike.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
well,
miller
el
emphasizes
that
we
need
to
view
the
prosecutor's
behavior
cumulatively.
and
again,
when
we
look
at
here
the...
the
prosecutor
coming
out
with
one
reason
after
another
to
try
to
justify
her
strikes,
consecutive
strikes,
of
the
only
two
black
women
on
this
jury,
there's
just
simply
no
credibility
left
to
give
to
the
demeanor
rationale
even
if
one
views
that
it's--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--juror
20
collins
explains...
mr....
trial
counsel...
defense
counsel,
explained
at
the
hearing
was
a
person
of
color
but
not
african
american.
so
the
record
shows,
i
believe,
we
have
one
african
american
on
the
jury
and
one
other
minority.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
well,
on
the
state
appeal,
it's
true
that
collins'
attorney
dropped
the
claim
specifically
as
to
juror
19.
but
the
reason
the
prosecutor's
strike
of
juror
19
is
relevant
is
at
step
three
of
batson,
this
court
has
emphasized
that
the
duty
of
the
trial
judge
to
determine
purposeful
discrimination
requires
an
examination
of
all
the
relevant
circumstances.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
well,
i...
i
think...
i
think
the
record
here
reinforces
your
honor's
view
on--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--well,
i...
i
think
if...
if
the
court
allows
to
happen
what...
what
happened
here,
then
i
think
the
message
it
could
be
saying
to
prosecutors,
as
long
as
you
can
just
rifle
off
a
series
of...
of
reasons
for
your
strike
and
then
the
trial
court
latches
onto
one
of
them,
taking
it
out
the
context
of
the
plausibility
of
all
the
other
strikes,
then
we're
going
to
allow
this
type
of
behavior
to
continue.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
first
of
all,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
prosecutor
had
appeared
many
times
before
this
trial
judge.
another
point
is--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--that's
right,
but
i
guess
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
it's
not
that
the
judge
said,
you
know,
ms.
prosecutor,
you've
appeared
before
me
many
times
and
i'm
willing
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
because
i
know
the
way
you
are.
we
have
nothing
like
that
here.
also,
as
far
as
it
being
instinctive,
batson
and
miller
el
require
the
prosecutor
to
give
the
reasons
and
stand
and
fall
on
the
plausibility
of
those
reasons.
and...
and
here--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--i
understand,
but
what's
significant
here
is
when
she
is
flopping
around,
the
reason
she
comes
up
with...
she
says
gender.
it's
patently
unconstitutional
and
discriminatory.
we
have
youth,
and
then
she
says,
well,
it's
not
that
they're
younger.
other
young
people
on
the
jury.
it's
not
that
i
don't
want
young
people.
and
she
doesn't
strike
juror
15.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
well,
that...
that
would
be
a...
a
tougher
case
for
us
because
we
would
have
an
explicit
ruling--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--of
what
actually
happened.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
i
still
think
that
in
this
case,
given
the
entire
context
and
all
the
other
reasons
given,
including
the
gender
reason,
that
it
would
still...
that
those
demeanor
and
youth
reasons
would
still
not
be
persuasive
looking
at
the
context--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--on...
on
this
record,
yes,
given
all
the
other
reasons
we
have
given
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
i
would
because
when
we
go
through
the
comparative
juror
analysis
and
look
at
the
record
of
the
whole,
we
see
that
the
reasons
given,
for
example,
on
youth
are
not
used
for
similarly
situated
white
jurors.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
6
was
different
in
that
he
was
unemployed,
in
fact,
had
never
been
employed,
and
also
he
had
an
uncle
who
was
a
recovered
alcoholic,
and
that
made
him
quite
different
from
juror
16.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
well,
i
think
she's
also
admitting
that
youth
wasn't
a
reason
because
she's
saying
there
are
other
young
people
on
the
jury,
and
the
significant
question
here--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--what's
wrong
with
that
here
is
the
question
is
why
is
she
using
that
rationale
against
the
young
black
juror
and
not
the...
the
young
white
jurors
on
the
panel?
how
come
she's
seeking
to
achieve
the
balance
by
striking
juror
16?
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
correct.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
right,
but
when
we
look
at
the
totality
of
the
reasons,
which
include
looking
at
the
way
she
treated
juror
19,
we
have
the
lack
of
ties
in
the
community--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--the
significance
of
the
treatment
of
juror
19
is,
right
out
of
the
box,
the
prosecutor
is
coming
up
with
reasons
that
she
says
apply
to
both
16
and
19,
the
only
two
black
women
on
the
jury.
and
these
are
very
disparate
women,
and
they're
different
in
age
and
occupation
status,
the
number
of
children
they
have,
and
people
they...
who
are
close
to
them
who
have
substance
abuse
problems.
and
right
out
of
the
box,
the
prosecutor
is
saying
that
both
of
them
are
disqualified
from
jury
service
because
they're
both
young,
when
juror
19,
in
fact,
was
a
retired
grandmother.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
i
respectfully
disagree
that
it
was
a
mistake.
her
answer...
her
response
that
juror
16
and
19
are
both
young
came
immediately
in
response
to
the
court's
request
that
the
prosecutor
justify
her
peremptory
strikes
of
judge
16...
juror
16
and
19.
and
then
later
on,
when
the
judge
said
that
gender
was
not
going
to
cut
it,
the
prosecutor
said,
well,
it's
not
really
gender.
she
back
tracked
to
youth,
and
she
said
what
is
important,
their
youth
is
important.
and
she
could
only
have
been
referring
to
16
and
19
at
that
point
because
there
was
no
claim
that
juror
6
was
being
excluded
because
of
his
gender.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
well,
i'm...
i...
i
don't
think
so
because
on
the
next
page
she
continues
discussing
juror
19
at
the
top
of
page
10.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
no,
no.
the
conclusion
is
that
she
was
striking
jurors
on
the
basis
of
the
race,
that
she
is
using--
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
--right.
we're
not
challenging
the
strike
of
19
per
se.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
prosecutor's
reasons
she
gave
for
19
are
important
in
trying
to
determine
whether
she
is
intentionally
discriminating
in
striking
juror
16.
and
the
fact
that
she
is
lumping
the
two
jurors
together,
not
treating
them
as
individuals,
but
treating
them,
in
fact,
stereotypically
by
saying
that
all...
that
three
of
these
reasons
apply
to
both
of
them,
when
the
record
clearly
shows
that
they
don't
apply
to
juror
19,
it
shows...
it
shows
the
discriminatory
behavior.
the...
the
attorney
general
said
that
this
case
is
unlike
miller
el,
but
i'd
just
like
to
emphasize
certainly
here
we
have
a
petitioner
who
was
representing
himself
pro
se
and
he
did
not
present
extra
record
evidence
of
a...
of
a
history
of
discrimination.
but
the
case
specific
evidence
is
similar
to
miller
el
in
important
respects,
and
miller
el
requires
relief
in
this
case.
first...
first
of
all,
three
of
the
reasons
given
here
for
the
strikes
pertain
just
as
well
to
non
black
jurors
as
to
the
black
jurors,
and
that's
youth,
tolerance,
and
single.
here,
as
in
miller
el,
we
have
the
district
attorney
scrambling
from
rationale
to
rationale
and,
when
called
on,
one
of
the
reasons
shifting
to
another.
and
here,
the
district
attorney
did
not
ask
questions
on
grounds
later
used
to
justify
the
strike.
now,
clearly
here,
it's
a
judge
conducted
voir
dire,
but
the
attorneys
were
allowed
to
ask
the
judge
to
ask
different
questions...
to
ask
that
the
judge
ask
additional
questions.
and
here,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
voir
dire
of
jurors
1
through
17,
the...
the
prosecutor
asked
the
judge
to
ask
four
additional
questions.
three
of
them
were
to
the
panel
generally
and
one
specifically
about
juror
8.
but
the
prosecutor
never
asked
that
any
additional
questions
be
asked
of
juror
16
before
she
struck
her.
if
i
could
turn
briefly
to
the
state's
jackson
v.
virginia
argument,
unless
there's
any
additional
questions
on
the
batson
claim.
the
state's
claim
that
(d)(2)
and
(e)(1)
incorporate
the
jackson
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test
is
contrary
to
the
plain
terms
of
(d)(2)
and
(e)(1)
and
this
court's
cases
construing
those
provisions.
and
the
state
still
hasn't
cited
a
single
case
prescribing
a
jackson
type
of
review,
and
courts
have
been
construing
aedpa
for
over
9
years
now.
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
line
for
the
state's
argument.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
our
argument
is
based
on
the...
the
structure
and
text
of
statute
and...
and
the
fact
that
the
clear
and
convincing
requirement
is
tied
to
the
presumption
of
correctness.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
did
apply
both
(d)(2)
and
(e)(1),
as
this
court
did
in
miller
el,
and
found
that
collins
has
satisfied
both
standards.
so
i
just
want
to
emphasize
for
the
court,
even
if
it
does
not
agree
with
us
on
our
construction
of
(e)(1),
that
relief
is
still
appropriate
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
right.
i...
i
think
our
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
we
have
the
presumption
of
correctness
as
part
of
(e),
which
is
the
fact
development
procedure
in
federal
court.
the
state's
jackson
argument,
i'd
just
like
to
highlight,
is
irreconcilable
with
what
this
court
said
in
miller
el
i,
and
what
it
did
in
miller
el
ii.
in
miller
el
i,
this
court
stated
that
federal
courts
can
disagree
with
state
court
credibility
determinations
and,
when
guided
by
aedpa,
determine
that
the
conclusion
is
unreasonable
or
its
factual
premise
rebutted
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
in
miller
el
ii,
this
court
disagreed
with
the
state
court
credibility
determination
and
granted
habeas
relief
even
though
the
significance
of
some
of
the
habeas
petitioner's
evidence
was
open
to
judgment
calls.
by
contrast,
this
court
stated
in
schlup
v.
delo,
that
the
assessment
of
credibility
is
generally
beyond
the
scope
of
review
in
jackson.
and
in
the
crenshaw
case
cited
by
the
state,
the
court
explained
that
under
jackson,
the
test
for
rejecting
evidence
as
incredible
is
extraordinarily
stringent
and
is
met,
for
example,
only
when
the
testimony
given
is
describing
facts
that
are
physically
impossible.
this
court
couldn't
have
granted
relief
in
miller
el
if
it
construed
(d)(2)
or
(e)(1)
as
containing
the
jackson
test,
and
the
state's
approach
would
effectively
bar
habeas
relief
whenever
a
habeas
petitioner
challenged
a
credibility
determination.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
i...
i
think
they're
different
standards.
(e)(1)
is
a...
a
standard
of
proof,
and
(d)(2)
is
a
standard
of
assessing
a
prior
court's
assessment
of
the
facts.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
no,
we
don't.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
if
i
could
briefly
sum
up.
in
powers
v.
ohio,
this
court
said
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
mandate,
that
racial
discrimination
be
eliminated
from
all
acts
and
proceedings
of
the
state,
is
most
compelling
in
the
judicial
system.
here,
the
district
attorney
struck
two
of
three
african
american
jurors,
including
both
black
women,
where
a
black
defendant
was
facing
a
sentence
of
25
years
to
life
in
a
three
strikes
case
for
possessing.1
grams
of
cocaine.
one
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
district
attorney
is
patently
unconstitutional:
gender.
and
all
the
other
reasons
are
either
contradicted
or
unsupported
by
the
record.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
in
this
case,
it's
very
significant
that
she
relied
on
the
unconstitutional
reason.
mr.

this
claim
was
not
raised
in
state
court
as
a
gender
challenge
as
opposed
to
race,
if
i'm
answering
the
court's
question.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
absolutely,
and
i
think
it
has
merit
here
because
it's...
it's
a
reason
the
district
attorney
admitted
that
was
motivating
her
strike.
it's...
it's
patently
unconstitutional
and
it
taints
every
other
reason
she
gave.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
there
is
not
besides
her
name.
mr.
mark
r.
drozdowski
no.
equal
protection
mandates
relief
in
this
case,
and
aedpa
does
not
prevent
it.
i
respectfully
request
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
