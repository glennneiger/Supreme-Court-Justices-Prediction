justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just...
did
the
individual
plaintiff
assert
the
1981
claim
at
any
time
before
the
settlement
of
the
corporate
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
have
assumed--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
wouldn't
have
been
a
settlement
first
without
taking
care
of
the
second,
if
they
had
known
both
were
on
the
table.
but
you
say
the
first
had
been...
both
of
them
had
been--
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
mahoney,
may...
may
i
ask
you
one
brief
question
that
i
should
have
asked
on
direct?
i
hope
you
have
time
for
it.
but
supposing
a
fact
situation
in
which
a
wholly
owned...
a...
a
corporation
wholly
owned
by
an
african
american
starts
to
negotiate
with
your
client,
and
your
client
says,
we
have
a
policy
of
not
dealing
with
companies
owned
by
african
americans.
would
the
corporation
or
the
individual
have
a
lawsuit
under
section
1981?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
the
corporation
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
under
1981.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
in
your
view,
to
the
extent
that
racial
discrimination
might
have
affected
negotiations,
that
would
be
an
element
of
the
corporation's
claim
under
1981
rather
than
an
individual
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
