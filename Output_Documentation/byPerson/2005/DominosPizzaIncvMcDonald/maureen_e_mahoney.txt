ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
complaint
in
this
case
actually
alleges
that
domino's
breached
its
obligations
under
a
contract
with
jwm.
it
does
not
allege
that
any
of
the
terms
of
mcdonald's
own
contracts
were
violated.
the
ninth
circuit,
nevertheless,
held
that
mr.
mcdonald
could
recover
damages
so
long
as
he
could
show
that
he
had
suffered
some
distinct
injury
arising
out
of
the
violation
of
the
contracts
between
his
company
and
domino's.
we...
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
that
holding
for
two
principal
reasons.
first,
mr.
mcdonald
did
not
hold
any
rights
under
the
contracts
between
his
company
jwm
and
domino's,
and
that's
disqualifying
under
section
1981.
second,
the
injuries
that
he
alleges
are
simply
too
indirect
to
be
cognizable
under
an
implied
right
of
action.
this
court,
even
in
the
context
of
express
rights
of
action,
whether
rico
or
the
clayton
act,
has
looked
to
the
background
principles
of
the
common
law
to
define
the
scope
of
a
damage
recovery.
and
these
kinds
of
injuries,
which
are
really
the
classic
form
of
derivative
injury,
have
never
been
recoverable.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
if...
if
he's...
yes,
you
can
get
emotional
distress
under
section
1981,
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
correct.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely.
there
is
no
standalone
cause
of
action
under
federal
law
simply
for
emotional
distress
that
is
suffered
as
a
result
of
racially
discriminatory
conduct.
presumably
congress,
you
know,
might
do
that
some
day,
but
it
has
not
done
so.
and
in
fact,
even
under
title
vii,
racially
disparaging
comments
can
cause
distress
to
a
worker
and
they're
still
not
actionable
unless
it
rises
to
the
level
of
a
hostile
work
environment.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
he
is
asking...
it's...
it's...
the
complaint
is
a
little
unclear,
but
he's
asking
for
losses
that
arise
out
of
the
company's
failure
to
have
revenues
that
would
have
passed
through
the
company
to
him
in
either
his
capacity
as
a
shareholder
or
possibly
as
an
employee.
in
fact,
it's
important
to
stress
how
indirect
these
injuries
really
are.
the
gravamen--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--$45,000,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
you're
wrong,
your
honor.
he
actually
in
his
complaint
asked
for
economic
damages.
he
doesn't
specify
them,
but
in
an
affidavit
that
he
submitted
to
the
district
court,
he
said
that
his
net
worth
had
declined
$8
million
and
he
is
saying
that
he--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but
either
way,
the
outcome
should
be
the
same
because
emotional
distress
is
not
a
standalone
claim.
he
has
to
establish
that
he
had
rights
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract
that
were
violated,
and
even
if
he
did
that,
he
still
has
to
show
that
the
damages
that...
that
were
caused
by
domino's
were
sufficiently
direct
to
be
cognizable.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
couple
of
problems
with
that.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
these
were
contracts
where
domino's
had
rights
under
these
contracts
as
well,
and
if
it
had
sued
mr.
mcdonald
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
for
failing
to
perform,
he
would
have
rightly
said,
that's
not
my
contract.
and
i
don't
think
that
we
can
think
that
congress
intended
this
court
to
simply
disregard
those
principles
that
have
always
governed
where
you...
if
you
take
the
benefits
of
avoiding
liability,
you
can't
turn
around
and
say,
well,
now
that
it's
time
to
recover
against
domino's,
it
is
my
contract.
that's
not
the
way
the
law
works.
he
can't
disown
the...
the
force
of
the
law
when
he's
taken
the
benefits
of
the
law.
and
now,
the
burden
here
is
really
a
moderate
one.
it's
one
that
says
that
the
recovery
that
is
owed
will
come
through
the
corporate
entity.
he
will
get
whatever
his
share
of
that
is
through
the...
the
corporate
processes,
and
he
won't
be
able
to
have
an
independent
claim
for
emotional
distress.
but--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
if
his
company
fired
him
because
he
couldn't
make
contracts...
in
other
words,
they
said,
we...
we
don't
want
you
to
be
our
ceo.
we
don't
want
a
black
ceo
because,
after
all,
we're
going
to
lose
business
with
these
other
companies...
then
i
think
under
an
interference
theory,
that
he
probably
could
sue
under
1981,
sue
both
his
company
and
also
the
third
party
that
induced
the
interference.
if
we
look
to
common
law
principles,
the
common
law
of
tortious
interference
established
various
rules
that
were
designed
to
provide
recovery
for
interference
when
the
causation
was
sufficiently
direct,
and
the
common
law
says...
this
is
section
766
of
the
restatement
and
cases
that
follow
that...
that,
in
essence,
if
the
third
party...
or
if
the
defendant
induces
the
breach,
essentially,
you
know,
tells
them,
this
is
how
we
want
it
done,
we
want
you
to
fire
so
and
so
if
you
want
our
business,
if
they
induce
the
breach
or
induce
the
violation,
then
they
can
be
liable
as
well.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor.
there
are
two
different
things.
i
mean,
one...
one
part
of
it
is
that
here
his...
he
doesn't
say
that
his
contract
wasn't
performed,
but
he
also
would
have
to
show
that
domino's
was
the
direct
cause
of
his
loss.
and
the
common
law,
under
section
766,
for
instance,
says,
look,
if
a...
if
a
third
party
or
if
the
defendant
just
made
it
more
difficult
for
your
employer
to
perform
or
for
your
company
to
meet
its
obligations,
its
contractual
obligations,
by
causing
it
to
have
less
money,
that
doesn't
count.
that's
not
inducing
a
breach.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
he
may
have
been
the
reason
for
the
discrimination,
but
the
target,
in
terms
of
the
direct
victim
of
the
conduct
that
is
alleged,
was
clearly
jwm.
it's
jwm
whose
contracts
were
supposedly
breached.
and...
and
the
point
is,
your
honor,
the...
the
law
has
made
it
clear
that
simply
breaching
a
contract
in
a
manner
that
makes
it
more
difficult
for
somebody
else
to
perform
is
not
a
sufficiently
direct
cause
of
the...
of
the
failure
to
perform
all
of
the
succeeding
downstream
contracts.
otherwise,
the...
the
rules
of
privity
would
simply
be
eroded.
so
instead,
it's
a
very
narrow
category
of
cases
where
a
breach
of
contract
can
be
viewed
as
the
direct
cause
of
another
party's
failure
to
perform
a
separate
contract
with
the
plaintiff.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example,
just
to...
to
show
what
it's
talking
about.
if,
for
instance,
there
is
a
contract
where
i
am
the
defendant
and
i
have
the
right
to
approve
an
assignment,
and
the
plaintiff
has
a
contract
with
a
third
party
and
i
refuse
to
approve
that
assignment.
then
i
have
retained
the
legal
control
under
the
terms
of
my
contract
as
to
whether
the
plaintiff's
contract
can
be
performed
or
not.
and
in
that
circumstance,
if...
if
i
deny
approval
on
the
basis
of
race,
i
have
made
it
literally
impossible
for
the
other
parties
to
perform.
and
that's
the...
the
narrow
exception.
it's
either
inducing
the
breach,
inducing
the
breach
of
a
contract,
or
it's
making
it
literally
impossible,
but
not
simply
making
it
more
expensive
or
more
difficult.
and...
and
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
why
these
rules
were
developed
under
the
common
law
this
way.
in...
in
part,
it
is
to
protect
the
very
reasonable
and
legitimate
interests
of...
of
innocent
third
parties.
in...
in...
take
the
corporate
context.
if
general
motors
has
a
dispute
with
a
major
customer,
and
imagine
that
there
is
some
sense
that
that...
that
the
customer
may
have
breached
its
contracts
because
it...
it
thought
gm's
work
force
had
too
many
black
faces,
gm
has
got
to
figure
out
what
to
do
about
that.
it's
not
going
to
capitulate
and
fire
its
work
force,
but
it
has
to
decide
whether
it
wants
to
settle,
whether
it
wants
to
litigate.
it
may
litigate
and
then
want
to
settle.
but
that's
its
claim,
its
contract
claim,
and
it
has
to
have
the
freedom
to
figure
out
how
it
ought
to
be
settled.
if
every
black
employee
at
gm
could
file
an
action
under
section
1981
for
emotional
distress
or
for
wage
increases
that
they
might
not
have
gotten
because
gm
lost
this
big
piece
of
business,
then
gm
would
lose
the
ability
to
control
the
settlement
of
its
own
claim.
and
so...
and
it's
an
innocent
party
in
this
fact
pattern.
so
the
law
has
been
designed
under...
under
the
common
law
to
make
sure
that
everybody's
interests
are
sufficiently
protected.
and
what
the
ninth
circuit's,
you
know,
ruling
does
here
and
what
the
plaintiffs
are
really
asking
for
is
to
just
blow
through
all
of
those
rules
that...
that
have
been
designed
to...
to
make
sense
out
of
contracts...
contract
laws
and
still
allow
some
room
for
tortious
interference
sorts
of
principles.
and
under...
under
the
court's
cases,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
to
think
that
congress
intended
the
court
to
create
an
implied
right
of
action
that
is
completely
divorced
from
the
common
law
principles
that
would
have
foreclosed
these
kinds
of
remedies.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
and
i--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
inverse...
reverse
piercing.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
not
that
i
know
of,
and
i
don't...
and
i...
i
think
if
you
did
that,
would
you
do
it
for
employees
too?
can
all
the
employees
sue?
i
mean,
where...
where
does
it
stop?
can...
if
domino's
violated
a
term
of
a
contract
because
it
was...
it
wanted
to
cause
economic
loss
to
the
employee
of
a
subcontractor,
can...
can
he
then
sue?
i
mean,
looking
at
the
theory
of
damage
in
this
case
shows
just
how
indirect
it
is.
if
you
look
at
paragraphs
24
through
27
of
the
complaint,
the
sole
theory
of
harm
here
is
that
domino's
had
an
obligation
to
provide
a
letter
to...
to
jwm,
certifying
that
jwm
wasn't
in
breach
of
any
terms
of
the
lease,
and
that
it
refused
to
provide
that
letter,
and
when
it
did
so,
the
bank
denied
some
financing
on
a
project,
and
then
that
caused
jwm
not
to
have
money
to
invest
in
other
projects.
and
so
then
it
didn't
have
enough
money
to
pay
its
creditors,
and
so
then
it
went
into...
had
to
declare
chapter
xi
bankruptcy.
and
then
mcdonald
didn't
get
as
much
money
from
the
corporation
as
he
otherwise
would
have.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
says
that
it's
protecting
the...
the
right
of
all...
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--not
that
i
can
think
of,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
language
of
this
statute,
though...
i
mean,
certainly
though...
of
course,
the
court
in
mcdonald
did
interpret
this
statute
to...
to
also
protect
white
person...
white...
white
people,
people
of
all
color,
despite
the
language
that
says,
you
know,
rights
the
same
as...
as
whites.
but--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
they
don't,
your
honor,
but
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have,
in
effect,
imputed
race
to
corporations
under
circumstances
where
their...
their
contractual
rights
have
been
violated
because
of
the
race
of
their
shareholders
or
employees.
and
that
has
been
well
settled,
at
least
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
think
you
have
to
be
an
expert
on
contract
law.
i
think
that
this
court
already
held
in
patterson,
for
instance,
that
section
1981
was
designed
to
have
its
own
federal
content,
but
that
when
we
look
at
the
term,
the
right
to
make
and
enforce
contracts,
certainly
we
have
to
interpret
that
in
light
of
common
law
rules.
and
under
the
common
law
of
contracts,
only
parties
and
third
party
beneficiaries
have...
hold
rights
under
those
contracts.
under
section
302
of
the
restatement,
it
defines
who
a
third
party
beneficiary
is,
and
i
think
that's
a
good
starting
place.
it
shows
us
that
children,
you
know,
as
in
this
court's
case
in
runyon,
are
third
party
beneficiaries.
union
members
are
third
party
beneficiaries
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
under
that...
under
the
comments
in
the
restatement.
but
the
plaintiff
acknowledges
that
the
shareholders
and
employees
are
not
intended
third
party
beneficiaries
of
the
contract.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
the...
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
contract
has
to
actually
identify
third
party
beneficiaries.
in
other
words,
parties
need
to
agree
on
who's
a
third...
on
who
the
beneficiaries
are
supposed
to
be.
and
here,
of
course,
there's
nothing
in
the
contracts.
they
haven't
alleged
there's
anything
in
the
contracts
to
identify
him
as
that.
and
also,
if...
if--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
it's
certainly
not
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
there
is
a
personal
guarantee.
and...
and
i
don't
think
so
because
when
domino's
sued
jwm,
it
did
not
sue
mr.
mcdonald.
and...
and
as
i
say,
if...
if
they
had,
i'm
sure
mr.
mcdonald
would
have
put
up
his
hand
and
said,
no,
thank
you,
that's
not
my
contract.
and
i...
so
i
don't...
i
think
that
really
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
just
to
look
at
the
language
and...
and
read
it
in
light
of
these
well
established
principles
because
that's
what
congress
would
have
intended
the
court
to
do,
and
that
he
is
not
a
third
party
beneficiary.
he
is
not
a
party.
and
so
the
ninth...
the
rationale
of
the
ninth
circuit
would
need
to
be
reversed
because
that's
all
it
relied
upon.
and
then
the
alternative
theory--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
do
that
because
there's
been
a
concession
in
this
case
that
mr.
mcdonald
is
not
a
third
party
beneficiary
under
the
normal
rules
and
is
asking,
instead,
that
the
court
create
new
rules,
rights
greater
than
third--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i...
i...
we
would
ask
that
this
court
not
do
that
for
two
reasons,
that
the
alternative
theory
of
tortious
interference
was
never
pled.
it
was
never
argued,
and
the
district
court
dismissed
this
complaint
with
prejudice
because
there
was
no
alternative
theory.
they
did
not
move
for
leave
to
amend.
so
i
think
this
court
should
say
one
of
two
things
about
the
alternative
theory.
either,
number
one,
it
is
waived,
or
number
two,
based
on
the
arguments
that
have
been
advanced
and
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
it
could
not
possibly
be
cognizable.
and
i...
i
don't
think
you
have
to
be
an
expert
on
interference
law
in
order
to
reach
that
conclusion
because--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i...
i
think,
your
honor,
that
in...
in
the
prior
cases,
in
patterson
in
particular,
that
the
court
rejected
the
idea
that
it
ought
to
be
the
state...
the
law
of
each
state
that
governs
the
scope
of
the
rights.
that
argument,
i
believe,
was
advanced
by
the
solicitor
general,
and
this
court
said,
no,
they
didn't
think
that
was
correct.
and
similarly,
in
haddle
v.
garrison,
which
is
a
section
1985
case,
this
court
looked
to
common
law.
but
it...
it
said
that
it's
really
federal
common
law
that
controls
these
issues.
so
i
think
it's
looking
just
to...
to
the
state
law
principles
to
inform
what
congress
may
have
had
in
mind
when
it...
it
allowed
for
persons
to
recover
for
violations
of
the
rights
to
make
and
enforce
contracts.
here--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--this
court
has
looked
to
both,
but
in
associated
general...
associated
general
contractors,
for
instance,
this
court
said
that
it's
not
bound
by
the
terms
of
common
law
that
existed
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
adopted,
and...
but
rather,
that
common
law
evolves,
and
so
it's
appropriate
to...
to
look
beyond
that.
i
think
it
bears
emphasis,
though,
that
the
common
law
of
tortious
interference
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
adopted
in
1866
was
narrower
than
it
is
today.
but
even
under
the
broader
views
of
tortious
interference,
the
plaintiffs
concede
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
recover
under
those
theories,
and
instead,
have
said
to
this
court
1981
should
be...
go
well
beyond
the
terms
of
common
law
interference
principles.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
always
true
in
tortious
interference
claims,
your
honor,
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--absolutely.
the
injured
party
has
to
allege
that
the
defendant
knew
about
the
contract
and
specifically
intended
to
interfere
with
the
performance
of
the
plaintiff's
contract.
but,
nevertheless,
we
know
of
no--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--and
to
injure.
well,
to
injure
him,
to
prevent
his
performance
for...
for
purposes
of
injury,
yes.
and,
nevertheless,
we
are
aware
of
no
case
that
has
ever
found
that
an
employee
of
a
company
or
a
shareholder
of
a
company
could
recover
under
common
law
tortious
interference
theory
simply
because
it
suffered
losses
arising
out
of
a
breach
of
contract
with
its
own
corporation
that
made
it
more
difficult
or
more
expensive
for
the
corporation
to
recover.
and
i
think
it...
it
is...
also
bears
emphasis
of
where
this
theory
would
take
the
court
if
it
were
to
recognize
this.
it
would
go
far
afield
from
the
core
requirement
that
there
not
be
discrimination
in
the
terms
of
an
employment
contract
because
this...
the
tortious
interference
theory,
of
course,
is
based
solely
on
the
concept
that
he
may
have
had
some
sort
of
implied
employment
agreement
with
jwm.
what
this
would
mean
then
is
that
if...
in
the
case
of
gm,
if
a
major
customer
cancels
a
contract
and
gm
doesn't
give
raises
to
its
work
force,
all
of
the
black
workers
would
have
causes
of
action
because
of
the
injuries
that
were
intended
because
the
contract
was
canceled
on
the
basis
of
race,
but
their
similarly
situated
white
coworkers
would
not.
they
would
have
suffered
exactly
the
same
injury,
but
they
would
have
completely
different
rights.
and
that
shows
why
this
derivative
injury
theory
just
doesn't
fit
section
1981
because
at
its
core,
it
has
to
be
about
preventing
discrimination
in
the
terms
of
the
actual
contract.
and
here,
there
is
no
allegation
that
jwm
subjected
mcdonald
to
any
discriminatory
terms
of
employment,
and
therefore,
it
is
not...
or
that
it...
a
breach
was
induced.
and
therefore,
it
isn't
the
paradigm
case,
and
it
would
create
problems
down
the
road
to
recognize
this...
this
kind
of
theory.
so
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
anything
radical,
and
i
think
the
whole
issue
of
tortious
interference
can
be
avoided,
if
the
court
would
prefer,
because
the...
the
theory
was
unquestionably
waived.
there
are
14
paragraphs
of
facts
in
this
complaint
laying
out
the
factual
allegations.
paragraph
11
says
that
mr.
mcdonald
is
the
president,
sole
shareholder,
and
operator
of
the
company.
nowhere
in
those
14
paragraphs
does
it
say
that
he
had
an
employment
contract
with
jwm.
similarly,
the
cause
of
action
paragraphs...
i
believe
there
are
15
of
them...
repeatedly
identify
the
contracts
between
domino's
and
jwm
as
the
contract
at
issue,
the
contract
that
was
breached,
the
terms
that
were
violated.
nowhere
does
it
refer
to
an
employment
contract.
this
complaint,
as
the
district
court
recognized,
only
pled
one
theory,
and
that
was
the
theory
that
mr.
mcdonald
was
entitled
to
enforce
the
rights
of
jwm.
it
does
not
plead
any
theory
about
violations
of
his
own
employment
contract.
and
as
i
said,
that...
even
if...
even
if
you
could
infer
it,
you
would
still
have
to
find
that
it's
not
a
cognizable
theory
because
he
doesn't
allege
that
the
terms
of
that
contract
were
actually
violated.
and
in
fact,
at
page
45
of
his
brief...
or
44,
he
concedes
that
jwm
did
perform
the
terms
of
the
contract.
and
second,
even
if
there
had
been
a
failure
of
performance,
he
cannot
show
that
domino's
was
a
sufficiently
direct
cause
of
that
failure
of
performance.
just...
just
to
give,
you
know,
yet
another
example,
i
mean,
if
i...
if
my
employer
has
a...
a
bad
year
this
year
because
somebody
breached
a
contract
with
the
employer
and
i
don't
get
a
bonus,
i...
you
know,
i
may
say
i
suffered
some...
some
loss.
the
value
of
my
contract,
my
employment
contract,
may
be
reduced,
but
my
rights
under
that
contract
have
not
been
impaired
or
abrogated.
i
have
the
same
rights.
they're
just
worth
something
less.
and
all
that
this
statute
does
is
to
protect
rights,
the
same
rights
as
white
people
have.
it
doesn't
say
that
you
are
protected
from
any
kind
of
discriminatory
conduct
in
the
economy
that
may,
in
some
sense,
make
your
rights
less
valuable.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
focus
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
any
need
for
a
remand.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
with
prejudice,
and
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
at
that
point,
the
plaintiff
was
under
an
obligation
to
seek
leave
to
amend
if
it
had
any
other
alternative
theory
that
it
wanted
to
advance
in
this
case.
otherwise,
we're
left
with
the
situation
where
they
can
see
that
dismissal
with
prejudice,
litigate
up
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
then
we
litigate
here.
we
go
back
down
and
we
keep
doing
this
seriatim.
it
would
make
no
sense.
the
dismissal
with
prejudice
was
proper,
and
certainly
in
a
1981
case,
despite
liberal
rules
of
pleading,
you
have
to
identify
the
contract
that
was
supposedly
violated,
as
well
as,
you
know,
the
other
elements.
second,
i
think
that
if
this
were
a
harder
case
about
tortious
interference
principles,
even
if
it
hadn't
been
waived,
i
might
understand
the
court's
reluctance
to
get
into
it.
but
we
know
from
the
briefing
that
the
plaintiff
has
conceded
that
his
claim
would
not
be
cognizable
under
the
common
law
of
contract,
third
party
beneficiary,
or
tortious
interference,
and
that
is
very
plain
from
the
brief
at
pages,
i
think,
43
through
46
where
they
acknowledge
that
under
section
76
of
the
restatement,
they
would
not
be
able
to...
to
recover.
and
they
say,
so
what.
this
isn't
a
federalized
version
of
common
law
of
interference.
so
given
that
concession,
i
think
all
this
court
would
have
to
say
is
that
the
alternative
theory
that
wasn't
even
pled
can't
possibly
state
a
claim
because
it...
it
asks
us
to
go
far
beyond
what
the
common
law
did.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
the
corporation
would,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely
because
they...
a
refusal
to
deal...
it
covers
rights
to
make
and
enforce
contracts,
and
if...
if
the
defendant
said,
i
will
not
deal
with
this
company,
then
i
think
that
they
have
a
right.
and
in
this
case,
there
was
a
claim
that
was
brought
by
the
company
for...
based
on...
for
breach
of
contract.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
but
the
trustee
makes
a
finding
that
the...
the
causation...
or
reports
to
the
court
that
causation
principles
could
not
be
established,
and
so
there
was
no
point
in
bringing
a
1981
claim
because
he
actually
found
in...
in
materials
that
are
in
the
record
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
because
if
the...
if
they
were
negotiating
on
behalf
of
the
company,
that
is
the
company's
right
to
contract.
it
is
not
the
individual's
right.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
what
the
courts
of
appeals
all
do.
judge
friendly
in
hudson
valley
freedom
theater
looked
at
this
issue
and
said
that
it
was
the
best
way
to
approach
this
issue,
that...
that...
and
explained
that
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
impute
the
corporation's
contract
rights
to
somebody
else,
give
them
power
to
enforce
their
contract
rights.
and
it
wasn't
a
1981
case,
but
it
was
analogous,
and
that
it
made
sense
to,
under
those
circumstances,
impute
race,
in
effect.
and
i
think
that
the
way
that
courts
have
done
it
is
also
linked
to
the
word
discrimination,
which
appears
in
1981(c).
in...
in
jackson
v.
birmingham
for
the...
for
instance,
this
court
did
find
that
a...
a
male
coach
had
been
subjected
to
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex,
even
though
he's
obviously
not
a
woman,
because
it's
a
form
of
discrimination.
and
i
think
the
courts
have
looked
at
that
as
well.
but
this...
the...
the...
all
of
the
exact
same
issues
that
are
alleged
in
this
complaint
were
already
raised
and
litigated
through
depositions
and
discovery
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
this
presents
all
of
the
problems
that
this
court
addressed
in
associated
general
contractors
about
why
there's
such
a
strong
presumption
against
derivative
claims
because
here
you
can't
trace
the
losses.
you
have
no
idea
whether
or
not
the
monies
that
jwm
would
have
recovered
from
domino's
would
have
been
used
to
pay
other
creditors
or
used
to
do
new
projects
or
perhaps
given
to...
to
mcdonald.
thank
you,
your
honor.
