can...
can
you
tell
me,
ms.
mahoney,
just
in...
in
a
case
where
the
person
is
directly
implicated...
he
was
the
one
discriminated
against.
he
obtains
in
a
suit
the
damages
for
the
loss
of
the
profits
in
the
contract.
what
are
the
other
damages?
does
he
get
emotional
distress?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
was
the
plaintiff's...
it
wasn't
here.
what
kind
of
damages
was
he
asking
for?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
mcdonald
had
had
a
contract
with
the
corporation
that
he
gets
80
percent
of
the
gross
from
every
contract.
could
he
then
sue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
in
this
case,
it's
pretty
obvious
they
didn't
care
about
the
corporation.
they
cared
about
him.
he
was
the
target.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
there
any
cases
where
we
pierced
the
corporate
veil
in
order
to
help
the
shareholder?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
kind
of
an
inverse--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--corporate
veil
piercing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
a...
in
a
sense
this
is
stronger
than
some
tortious
interference
claims
because
here
the
target
is
this...
this
party.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
that...
that
the
injured
party
has
to
be
the
target?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
interfere
but
not
necessarily
to
injure
him.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
referring
to
runyon,
for
instance?
the
parents
always
had
a
special
relation
to
the
child.
it's
something
of
a
stretch
to
say
that
the
corporation
has
that
same
relation
with
its
own
shareholder.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
no
doubt
he's
the
target.
that's
