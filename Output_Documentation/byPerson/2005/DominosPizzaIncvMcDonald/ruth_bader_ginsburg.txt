justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
he's
saying
is
treat
me
as
a
sole
proprietor.
yes,
i
created
this
corporation
so
i
can
be
insulated
from
liability,
but
this
is
a
one
person
show
and
so
i
am
bringing
a
1981
claim
and
say
forget
the
corporation.
i'm
the
only
human
that's
involved
in
this
activity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
say
there
is
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
corporations
have
a
color?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
this
is
a
matter
of
federal
contract
law,
common
law,
federal
common
law,
are...
or
are
you
saying
you
go
state
by
state,
in
which
case
1981
is
some
places
it
will
be
third
party
beneficiary,
some
it
won't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wouldn't
just
be
an
argument.
you'd
have
to
amend
your
complaint
because
it
wasn't
set
out
in
the
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
overlap?
the...
what
damages
could
the
corporation
jwm
have
collected
under...
had
it
brought
a
1981
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
contracts--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you'd
have
to
concede
at
a
minimum
that
now
that
the
corporation
has
settled
the
breach
of
contract
claim,
that
to
the
extent
that
the
corporation
could
have
recovered
under
1981,
that's
gone
too
because
those
two
claims
were
intimately
related,
and
you
would
be
precluded
from
bringing
such
a
claim.
so
to
the
extent
that
there's
an
overlap,
you
face
a
res
judicata
bar.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
they...
the
ninth
circuit's
view
is
there
are
two
potential
plaintiffs
in
this
situation.
both
can
sue
and
one
gets...
the
damages
are
not
identical.
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
shareholder
can
sue.
the
sole
shareholder
can
sue.
the
corporation
can
sue.
both
have
1981
claims.
it's
not
either/or.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
both
have
1981
claims,
but
the
damages
are
different
in
the
case
of
the
individual
than
in
the
case
of
the
corporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
fits,
it's
because
of
some
cases.
so...
because
this
whole
area,
1981,
didn't
take
off
until
runyon
against
mccrary.
so
we're
starting
with
what?
1976.
so
to...
to
flesh
out
what
that
claim
is,
you
must
be
relying
on
some
decisions
of
this
court
when
you
talk
about
dignitary
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
didn't
go
into
anything.
that
was
a
two
page
per
curiam,
and
it
was
just
was
there
a
claim.
and
it
didn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that
that
was
about
does
the...
does
the
act
cover
religion
or...
or
does
it
cover
that
situation,
or
is
it
limited
to
race,
or
does
anti
semitism
count
as
race.
i
thought
that's
what
was
all
that
was
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
opinion
about...
i
just
see
the
issue
before
the
court
was
does
this
come
under
the
heading
race.
