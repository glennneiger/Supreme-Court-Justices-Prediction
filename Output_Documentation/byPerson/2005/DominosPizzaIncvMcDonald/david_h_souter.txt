justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
they
were...
they
were
essentially,
as
i
guess
you
said
a
moment
ago,
emotional
distress
kinds
of
injuries
because
otherwise
he'd
be
claiming
a
double
recovery.
so
he
doesn't
do
that
because
they...
they
settled
the
contract
case
with
the
corporation
for
what?
$46,000?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
that
the
only
thing
he...
he's
not
claiming
an
economic
injury,
as
i
understand
it,
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
i
guess
that's
where
i
went
wrong.
i
thought
those
were
the
reasons
that
he
was
claiming
that
he
had
been
distressed
emotionally.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're...
you're
saying
he
wants
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can
you...
can
you
do
that
under
a
general
contract
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
reporting
not
merely
the...
the
tort
of
tortious
interference,
but
some
general,
broader
concept
of
tort
law
as
being
subsumed
with...
under
1981.
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
the...
the
focus
of
it
is,
as...
as
i
understand
it,
and
the...
the
kernel
of
it
is...
is
the
capacity
to
contract.
and
we
can
certainly
understand,
i
guess,
how
tortious
interference
with
contracts
might
come
under
that
umbrella,
but
you're
going
further
and
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
any
tort
that
would
give
a
recovery...
recognize
a
recovery
for...
for
dignitary
injury
would
be
subsumed
with...
within
the
concept
of
what
1981
was
intended
to...
to
cover,
which
is
a
broader
proposition.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
contract...
i...
you...
you
pointed
out
the...
the
terminology
which
includes
contract
damages
or...
or
contract
harm
as
personal
harm,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
from
that
that
every
harm
or
every
injury
that
is
personal
falls
under...
conceptually
under
the
1981
umbrella.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
there's
no
way
to
confine
it
to
the
individual,
is
it?
i
mean,
the...
on
your...
on
your
target
theory,
a...
a
general
discriminatory
animus
as
a
basis
for
breaching
a
contract
with
general
motors
would
give
a
right
of
action
to...
to
every
minority
employee
of
general
motors.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
none
of
the
ruin
occurred,
as
i
understand
it,
until
the
corporation
went
bankrupt.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
direct...
the
bank,
for
example,
didn't
say
we're
not
doing
any
more
business
with...
with
you,
mcdonald.
as
i
understand
it,
all
the...
all
the...
leaving
dignitary
harm
aside,
all
the
actual
loss
was...
was
as
a
consequence
of
the
loss
to
the
corporation.
his
stock
fell,
you
know,
whatever.
but
it...
it
seems
all
derivative
from
the
corporate
loss.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can
you
give
me
an
example?
