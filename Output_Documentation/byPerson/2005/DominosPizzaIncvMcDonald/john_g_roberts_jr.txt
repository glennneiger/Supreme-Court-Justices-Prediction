chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
have
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel,
what
if
you
have
a
case
where
a
company
says
we
are
not
going
to
deal
with
any
companies
that
have
an
african
american
as
the
ceo?
couldn't
that
ceo,
the
individual,
claim
that
that
policy
interferes
with
his
ability
to
make
contracts
with
his
company
to
be
the
ceo?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
shouldn't
he
then
have
a
right
to
bring
a
claim
under
section
1981?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
not...
maybe
not
shareholders
in
general,
but
what
if
you
have
a
situation,
like
here,
where
you're
dealing
with
sole
shareholders?
why
is
that
a
real
stretch
to
say
that
that
person
is
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
the
contracts
of
his
corporation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
was
nothing
in
these
contracts
requiring
anything
in
the
way
of
personal
guarantees
or
anything
of
that
sort?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
is
it
state
law
today
or
state
law
back
when
section
1981
was
passed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lichtenstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
take
that
last
one
first,
if
you
don't
mind,
since
the
argument
is
that
you've
waived
that
argument
by
not...
not
raising
it
below.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
allegation
i'm
looking
for...
and
i...
i
guess
you
probably
didn't...
you
didn't
have
to
raise
it
below,
given
the
state
of
the
ninth
circuit
law
i
would
suppose.
but
in
your
brief
in
opposition,
where
it
is
raised
that
this
interferes
with
the
contract
between
you
and...
between
mcdonald
and
jwm?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
coming
here,
i
would
have
thought
our
rules
say
that
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
this
as
a
ground
for
affirmance
here,
we
should
see
it
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
both
sullivan
and
shaare
tefila,
of
course,
though,
were
1982
cases.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
1981
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
mahoney,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
attribute
the
shareholder's
race
to
the
corporation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
in
no.
