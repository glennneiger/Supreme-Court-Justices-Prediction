justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
you...
you
did
not
raise
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
it's...
it's
brand
new
to
us.
we...
we
didn't
think
this
was
in
the
case
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i...
i
thought
the
question
presented...
i
didn't
think.
i'm
reading
it
from
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
in
the
absence
of
a
contractual
relationship
with
the
defendant,
are
allegations
of
personal
injuries
alone
sufficient
to
confer
standing
on
a
plaintiff
pursuant
to
42
u.s.c.,
section
1981?
so,
i
mean,
the
question
presented
was...
was
precisely
if
your
client
did
not
have
a
contractual
relationship,
would
the
mere
allegation
of
personal
injury,
which
you're
now
alleging,
be
enough
to
confer
standing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
question
is...
i
mean,
that
begs
the
question,
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
section
1981,
and
the
argument
here
is
that
there's
no
violation
of
section
1981
unless
you're
interfering
with
a
contract
of
the
plaintiff.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
you
didn't
allege
and
didn't
even
raise
in
the
brief
in
opposition
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
his
contract
with...
with
the
corporation?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
exactly
the
issue.
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
how
i
understood
this
came...
case
came
up
here.
the
contract
you're
relying
on
is
the
contract
between
the
corporation...
between
the
corporation
and
domino's.
and
can
you...
can
you
sustain
a
lawsuit
for
the
violation
of
that
contract?
there
was
no
mention
of
any
other
contract.
i
don't
know
why
we
should
send
it
back
down
so
you
can
mention
a
contract
that
you
haven't
even
thought
of
even
when
you
filed
the
brief
in
opposition.
so
that's
the
issue,
whether
the
violation
of
the
contract
between
mcdonald...
between
domino's
and
your
client's
corporation
will
allow
your
client
to
get...
to
get
some
damages
inasmuch
as
he
was
the
target.
that's
how
i
understood
the
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
could
you
tell
me
when...
the...
the
claim
was
settled
when
your
client's
corporation
was
in
bankruptcy.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
your
client
had
no...
nothing
to
say
about...
about
whether
the
settlement
would
be...
would
be
accepted
by
the
trustee
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
out
of
his
hands,
which
means
that,
you
know,
you're...
you're
sort
of
pleading
the
advantage
of
a
corporation,
limited
liability
and
all
of
that,
and
went
through
bankruptcy
taking
that
advantage,
one
of
the
consequences
of
which
was
that
you
left
it
to
the
corporation
to
settle
this
claim.
and
now
you
want
to
disclaim
the
advantage
of
a
corporation
and
say,
oh,
although
the...
you
know,
the
corporation
settled
it
out...
you
know,
i
was
no
longer
in
control
of
it
because
of
the
bankruptcy...
i
want
to
bring
the
claim
on
my
own.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
why
it
would
be
nice
for
you
to
get
that,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
should
be
able
to
play
dog
in
the
manger
that
way.
you
either...
you
either
accept
the
corporate
form
or
you
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
was
his...
it
was
his
corporation,
and
until
he
went
bankrupt,
any
recovery
by
that
corporation
would
have
been
a
recovery
by...
by
john
mcdonald.
what...
what
created
your
problem
is
the
fact
that...
that
the
corporation
went
bankrupt.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
you
know,
that's...
that's
one
of
the...
one
of
the
consequences
of
taking
advantage
of
the
corporate
form.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
talk
about
personal
injury
that...
that
broadly.
it
talks
about
the
right
to
make
and
enforce
contracts.
that's
the
portion
of
it
you
have
to
be
relying
upon.
it
doesn't
talk
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--personal
injury.
it's
not
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
a
more
generalized
tort.
if
want
to
call
it
a
tort,
it
is
a
tort
that
goes
to
your
ability
to
make
and
enforce
contracts.
i
don't
see
anything--
justice
antonin
scalia
--dignitary
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
it
means
discrimination
that
relates
to
the
making
and
enforcing
of
a
contract
with
somebody
else.
and
you're
saying
that
since
the
discrimination
was
targeted
at
you,
even
though
the
contract
was
with...
was
with
somebody
else,
you
have
a
claim
under
this
language
of
1981.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
when
you
say
damages
that
can
be
proven,
the
only
damages
you...
you
insist
upon
proving
is
the
fact
that
you
were
a
target
and
that
it...
it
insulted
you.
it...
it
was...
you
know.
that's
the
only
damage
you
require.
so
you're
saying
that
every...
every
minority
employee
of
all
of
the
companies
with
whom
gm,
or
whoever
it
is
didn't
do
business,
would
automatically
have
a
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
okay.
well,
then...
then
what
do
they
have
to
show?
they
have
to
show
that...
that
their
salaries
were...
were
reduced?
but...
but
you
haven't
shown
that
here.
you
didn't
plead
that
here.
they
have
to
show...
show
that
a
contract
with
them
was
breached?
but
you
didn't
plead
that
here
and
you
didn't
show
it
here.
so
the...
the
only
thing
that...
that
you...
you
can
answer
is
they
would
all
have
causes
of
action
if
their...
their
honorific
values
were
somehow
impugned.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was...
that
was
the
consequence
of
the
bankruptcy
of
his
corporation.
i
mean,
that
didn't...
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit.
the
respondent,
john
mcdonald,
a
black
man,
is
the
sole
shareholder
and
president
of
jwm
investments,
inc.
the
petitioners
here
--
collectively,
i
will
refer
to
them
as
“domino’s
pizza”
--
contracted
with
mcdonald's
corporation,
jwm,
to
construct
four
restaurants
in
the
las
vegas
area.
problems
developed
between
jwm
and
domino’s
after
the
first
restaurant
was
completed.
to
make
a
long
story
short,
the
contracts
between
jwm
and
domino’s
remained
uncompleted,
and
at
least
in
part
for
that
reason
jwm
filed
for
chapter
11
bankruptcy.
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings,
the
breach-of-contract
claim
against
domino’s
was
settled
by
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
for
$45,000,
and
jwm
gave
domino’s
a
complete
release.
in
his
personal
capacity
and
separate
from
jwm’s
bankruptcy
proceedings,
mcdonald's
brought
the
present
claim
under
42
u.s.c.
§1981.
this
provision
originally,
part
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
protects
the
equal
right
of,
“all
persons
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
to
make
and
enforce
contracts,”
without
regard
to
race.
the
statute
defines
the
term
“make
and
enforce
contracts”
to,
“include
the
making,
performance,
modification
and
termination
of
contracts,
and
the
enjoyment
of
all
benefits,
privileges,
terms
and
conditions
of
the
contractual
relationship”.
mcdonald
alleged
that
domino’s
broke
its
contract
with
jwm
because
of
racial
animas
towards
mcdonald
and
that
this
breach
harmed
mcdonald
personally.
the
district
court
granted
domino’s
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
since
mcdonald
himself
was
party
to
no
contract
with
domino’s.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit
reversed.
relying
on
its
own
precedent,
it
concluded
that
mcdonald's
injury
was,
“distinct
from
that
of
the
corporation,”
and
that
he
therefore
could
bring
his
own
1981
claim.
the
9th
circuit
acknowledged
that
its
approach
set
it
apart
from
other
circuits.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
9th
circuit.
the
contractual
relationship
that
was
allegedly
impaired
for
racially
discriminatory
reasons
was
between
domino’s
and
jwm.
mcdonald
points
out
that
in
his
capacity
as
president
of
jwm,
he
did,
“make
and
enforce”
contracts
for
jwm.
but
the
rights
under
those
contracts
belonged
to
jwm
itself.
mcdonald
chose
to
conduct
business
through
the
corporate
form
and
acted
as
agent
of
the
corporation.
this
carries
with
it
certain
advantages;
for
example,
mcdonald
was
not
personally
liable
in
jwm’s
bankruptcy.
but
the
bitter
must
be
taken
with
the
sweet.
here,
the
corporate
form
prevents
mcdonald
from
claiming
jwm’s
injuries
or
rights
as
his
own.
mcdonald's
role
as
an
agent
of
jwm
does
not
give
him
the
ability
to
state
a
claim
under
1981,
because
that
statute
does
not
protect
one’s
right
to
act
as
the
agent
of
someone
else’s
contracting;
it
instead
protects
the
right
to
give
and
receive
contractual
rights
of
one’s
own.
mcdonald
alleges
that
his
race
was
the
reason
domino’s
breached
its
contracts
with
jwm
and
that
he
was
the
actual
target
of
domino’s
actions.
but
the
reason
for
the
impairment
does
not
change
the
fact
that
mcdonald
had
no
rights
under
the
contractual
relationship
that
was
impaired.
section
1981
is
a
powerful
remedy
for
racial
discrimination
in
contracting,
but
it
has
always
been
limited
to
remedying
race-based
impairments
to
one’s
own
existing
or
proposed
contractual
relationships.
the
9th
circuit
therefore
erred
in
reversing
the
district
court’s
dismissal,
and
its
judgment
is
reversed.
the
opinion
is
unanimous;
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
in
the
case.
