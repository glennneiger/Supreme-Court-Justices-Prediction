justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
two
separate
arguments
here,
and
i'm
trying
to
separate
them.
i
guess
that
many
states
have
a
doctrine
in
two
areas
of
law.
third
party
beneficiaries
can
sometimes
recover;
sometimes
they
can't.
victims
of
efforts
to
interfere
with
a
contract
sometimes
recover;
sometimes
they
can't.
and
one
question
is
whether
this
particular
individual
fits
within
those
doctrines.
and
you
have
to
be
an
expert
on
contract
law
to
know.
but
in
respect
to
the
civil
rights
law,
i
guess
your
position
is...
and
this
is
what
i
want
to
know...
that
whatever
those
doctrines
are,
they
have
to
be
the
same
for
white
people
as
for
black
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so...
so
they
might
apply.
one
thing
you
couldn't
do
if
you're
a
state
is
have
a
different
rule
for
black
people
that
treated
them
worse
than
white
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
has
there
ever
been
a
case
in
respect,
whether
it's
affirmative
action
or
some
other
thing,
that
interprets
that...
that...
this
particular
civil
rights
statute
to
say
that
for
whatever
historical
reasons,
et
cetera,
black
people
are
entitled
to
more
protection
under
contract
law
than
white?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
do
we
deal
with
this?
that
is
to
say,
do
i
have
to
become
an
expert
on
contract
law,
or
do
i
say
to
the
ninth
circuit
or
the
circuit,
look,
the...
the
question
here
is
not
what
the
contract
law
is
except
insofar
as
it's
relevant
to
whether
there's
a
differential
in
treatment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
that's
exactly
what
i'm
asking.
if...
if
you
win,
this
case
is
reversed,
sent
back.
i
mean,
what
do...
would
i
tell
them?
and
why
not
tell
them,
instead
of
having
to
delve
into
this,
is,
look,
it's
plausible
here
that
third
party
beneficiary
doctrine
might
cover
this
person?
it's
also
plausible
not.
we're
not
experts.
we
don't
know.
you
figure
out
what
the
normal
rule
is
and
apply
that
normal
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
the
other
part
of
it,
which
is
the...
the
interference
with
the
contract?
could
we
say
the
same
thing
there?
we
send
it
back,
say,
look,
we're
not
experts
on
this,
it's
a
matter
of
state
law
typically,
and
be
absolutely
sure,
please,
that
whatever
doctrine
you
normally
apply
is
applied
to
this
case
too
because
it's
plausible.
he's
the
sole
shareholder.
he's
the
sole
beneficiary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
targeted
enough?
i
mean,
i'm
thinking
here
not
necessarily
your
case,
but
in
general.
is
a
claim
of
discrimination...
i
don't
know
the
state
of
the
law,
but
maybe
if
a
minority
shareholder...
a
minority
person
is
the
sole
shareholder
of
a
corporation,
maybe
that
corporation
could
assert
protection,
or
maybe
it
couldn't.
but
here,
i
take
it
that
the
corporation
jwm
brought
an
action
and
won
or
settled
for
$45,000.
so
they're
out
of
it.
now
we're
just
thinking
about
the
sole
shareholder,
and
the
sole
shareholder
says
there's
another
action
here.
and
as
to
the
two
most
plausible
ones
that
i
would
like
to
assert
an
action
as
a
third
party
beneficiary,
we've
heard
the
other
side
say
that
you've
conceded
you
have
no
right
there.
and
as
to
the
other
one,
which
might
be
protected
in
many
cases,
that
the...
knowing
that
what
was
going
to
happen,
they
deliberately
interfered
with
the
contractual
relation
between
me
and
the
corporation.
that's
what
we're
asking
about
now.
and
you
say,
well,
i
didn't
raise
that.
now,
is
there
a
reason
you
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
raise
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
conceded
that
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
might--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
the
argument
for
sending
it
back,
if
i
understand
it,
is
this,
that
when
you
look
at
the
question
presented,
no
one
could
possibly
file
a
lawsuit...
and
you
didn't...
on
the
theory,
well,
i'm
hurt,
so
somebody
should
pay
me.
that
isn't
the
legal
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rather,
the
legal
theory
here
was
that
this
contract
related
section
of
the
law
is
violated.
and
you
want
to
say
the
simple
fact
that
the
contract
wasn't
between
mcdonald
and
jwm,
that's
a
separate
matter.
that
doesn't
bar
you
from
bringing
your
claim.
so,
on
the
one
hand,
you
argue
that
i
can
bring
my
claim
as
long
as
i'm
a
target
and
the
motive
as
to
why
they
breached
some
other
contract,
the
one
between
the
two
corporations.
and
we
seem
to
have
it
conceded
that
even
if
that's
too
broad,
there
are
at
least
some
circumstances
where
you
could
bring
your
claim.
one
is
if
you
were
a
third
party
beneficiary.
that's
not
present
here.
and
the
second
is
if
you
are
a
target
such
that
their
action
violates
and
interferes
with
a
contract
between
you
and
your
own
corporation.
at
least
you
have
that
going
for
you.
so
you
say,
well,
if
i
was
wrong
about
the
broader
theory,
give
me
a
chance
to
allege
the
narrower.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
be
helpful
in
this
respect.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
you
have
to
say
the
certain
kind
of
target.
the
kind
of
target
is
that
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--were
discriminatory,
aiming
at
me,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
an
action--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
that
in
california?
wouldn't
you
have
an
action
in
the
state
if
somebody
goes
and
deliberately
interferes
with
your
credit
and
so
forth?
