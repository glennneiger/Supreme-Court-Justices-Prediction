mr.
allen
lichtenstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here
is
whether,
by
choosing
to
operate
as
a
solely
owned
corporation,
john
mcdonald
forfeited
his
1981
protection.
rather
than
federalizing
state
contract
law,
section
1981
imposes
a
nonnegotiable
nondiscrimination
duty
that
is
neither
a
contractual
provision
nor
governed
by
contract
law.
intentional
racial
discrimination
is
not
merely
a
breach
of
contract
terms.
as
this
court
has
already
noticed...
noted,
it
is
more
akin
to
a
tort.
domino's
question
presented
asks
that
both
plaintiff
and
defendant
had
to
be
parties
to
the
contract.
yet,
domino's
notes
that
non
parties
without
privy
of
contract
are
also
protected,
citing
third
party
beneficiaries
and
the
fact
there
were
employers,
such
as
supervisory
employees
or
prime
contractors.
thus,
even
domino's
concedes
that
the
answer
to
the
question
presented
is
no.
section
1981
protection
is
not
limited
to
parties
to
the
contract.
there's
still,
however,
the
remaining
question
of
whether
john
mcdonald
fits
within
the
statute's
protection.
clearly,
if
he
had
been
a
sole
proprietor,
there
would
be
no
question
of
stating
a
cause
of
action.
we
contend
that
he's
still
protected
based
on
three
grounds:
one,
the
intended
language
of
section
1981;
two,
john
mcdonald's
relationship
with
domino's;
and
three,
john
mcdonald's
relationship
with
jwm.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
well,
we
believe
that
it
has
been
sufficiently
raised
below.
1981
does
not
have
any
special
or
enhanced
pleading
requirements.
this
is
notice--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--it
doesn't
allege
a
tortious
interference
claim,
and
this
really
isn't
a
tortious
interference
claim
as
petitioners
suggest.
this
is
a
1981
discrimination
claim,
and
very
clearly
that
was
alleged.
in
terms
of
the
requirement
for
wages,
back
wages
and
front
wages,
that
is
on...
i
believe
it's
page
17.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
i
don't
think
it
does
appear
there
specifically.
but
again,
the...
the
question
was
a
fairly
narrow
one,
which
is
what
is
ninth
circuit
law.
does
gomez
apply?
and
it
went
up
to
the
ninth
circuit
on
that
particular
level.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
the
brief
in
opposition
at
the
ninth
circuit
you're
referring
to
or--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--this
brief?
the
allegations
concerning
our
argument
about--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--they
did
not
raise
that...
that--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--well,
again,
i
think
that
if
the
issue
is
whether
it
was
raised
below
or
should
be,
then
perhaps
a
remand
back
to
flesh
out
that
particular
argument
would
be
the
appropriate
response.
i
think
that
in
terms
of--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--if
the
court
believes
that
it
more
specifically
needs
to
be
set
out
in
the
complaint,
then
clearly
that
would
be
one
of
the
remedies.
we
don't
really
believe
that
that
is
necessary
in
a
sense
when
dealing
with
the
question
presented.
both
of
our
arguments
are
really
sort
of
formulations
of
the
same
argument.
the
question
is
did
domino's
actions
aim
at
john
mcdonald.
was
he
the
precise
target?
that
was
clearly
set
out,
and--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--i
believe
that
the
opportunity
to
raise
that
is
part
of
the...
the
same
argument.
this
isn't
really
a
question
of
third
party
beneficiary.
this
is
an
issue
of--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--discrimination
and
this
was
claimed
in
terms
of
discrimination.
if
in
fleshing
this
out,
it
was
not
specified
in
the
various
ways
that
this
discrimination
was
affected,
that
oversight
shouldn't
preclude
the
basic
argument
that
is
really
the
same--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--because
it
still
is
responsive
to
the
question
presented,
which
is,
is
the
privity
issue
one
that
precludes
recovery
for
john
mcdonald?
and
that
seems
to
be
the
same
issue,
regardless...
regardless
of
how
it's
formulated.
and
the
answer
to
that
question
i
think
is...
is
clearly
no
in
terms
of
the
tort...
tortious
behavior
by
the...
by
domino's
in
terms
of
the
discrimination.
it
is
not...
also,
the--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--well,
it's...
the
allegation
of
both...
well,
discrimination
is
a
personal
injury.
in
goodman,
this
court
has
said
that
violation
of
section
1981
is
a
personal
injury.
it's
not
a
contract
injury.
so
the
question
presented--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--and
the
response
of
the...
of
the
respondent
is
it
is
not
simply
your
own
contract
or
your
contract
with
the
defendant
that
is
subject
to
1981
protection.
there
are
several
instances...
and
we've
cited
them
in
our
brief...
such
as
shaare
tefila
and
runyon...
where
the
actual
target
of
the
discrimination
is
not
in
contractual
privity
with
the
defendant.
and--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--i
think
in
this
particular
case
it
isn't
a
stretch.
the
discrimination
was
aimed
at
john
mcdonald.
there
was
not--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--but,
i
mean,
the...
domino's
itself
viewed
jwm
as
john
mcdonald.
the
statement,
we
don't
want
to
do
business
with
you
people...
you
people
isn't
anyone
else
other
than
john
mcdonald.
and
the
allegations
go
further
than
simply
back
wages
and
even
the
dignitary
damages
which
are
available
under
section
1981
but
not
under
contract
law
is
also
alleged
that
by
going
after
his
credit
and
going
after
the
banks
that
he
had
relationships
with
and
given
guarantees
to
and
going
after
him
personally,
that
this
wasn't
simply
derivative
of
jwm's
damages,
that
he
had
his
own
separate
damages
that,
in
fact,
could
not
have
been
recovered
by
jwm
had
jwm
filed
a
1981
action.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
it
had...
it
could
bring
the...
a
suit
for
the
damages
of
the
lost
revenue
that
it
could
have
gotten
from
its
contract.
we
believe,
looking
at
state
law,
because
we
think
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
here
jwm
would
get
its
net
profits.
the
wages
that
would
be
paid
out
would
be
recoverable
by
john
mcdonald.
different
states
may
look
at
this
differently,
but
that
really
wasn't
the
issue
that
this
case
had
been--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
well,
i
don't--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--well,
i
don't
really
think--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--i
understand,
and
i
do
appreciate
it.
i
don't
think
the
broader
theory,
number
one,
was
if
i
was
a
target,
that's
all
there
is.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
also--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--yes.
i
think
that
there
are
circumstances,
in
terms
of
alleging
particular
injuries
and
interference
with
the
making,
enforcing,
or
performance
of
contract.
i
don't--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--i...
i
think
we
alleged
that
in
terms
of
the
ability
of
mr.
mcdonald
to
perform
on
the
contract,
even
though
it
was--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--the--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--the
statute
doesn't
say
that
it
has
to
be
his
own
contract
with
the
defendant.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
and
that's--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--well,
that
is
clearly
the
main
thrust
of...
of
our
position.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
yes.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
absolutely.
he...
it
was
out
of
his
hands.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
the
corporate
form
gives
certain
protections,
largely
from
personal
responsibility
for
corporate
debt
has
some
tax
advantages.
it
certainly
is
not
going
to
protect
any
corporate
officer
or
shareholder
from
their
own,
for
example,
tortious
behavior.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
your
honor,
even
if
that
claim
had
not
been
precluded
by
bankruptcy...
and
there
were
two
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
jwm
and
mcdonald...
there
certainly
couldn't
be
double
recovery.
anything
that
would
be
recoverable
in
any
form
by
jwm
clearly
cannot
be
recovered
by
john
mcdonald
as
an
individual.
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
that.
they
were
talking
about
his
own
separate
and
distinct
injuries.
so
double
recovery
would
never
be
possible.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
i'm
sorry.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
correct.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
absolutely.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
yes,
i
believe
that
the...
and
i
would
have
to
check
on
the
timing
of
this,
but
i
believe
that
the
suit
was
filed
prior
to
the
settlement
of
the
1981
claim...
of
the
bankruptcy--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--i'm
sorry.
of
the
bankruptcy
claim.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
that
is
my
understanding.
i...
i
would
have
to
really
check
on
that,
but
that
is
my
understanding.
and
again,
we
are
looking
at
this
particular
situation.
we
keep
talking
about
actual
target.
the
petitioner
keeps
talking
about
derivative,
incidental
claims.
this
isn't
a
derivative,
incidental
claim.
there
is
no
one
who
has
a
race
in
this
case
that
is
relevant
other
than
john
mcdonald.
jwm,
john
w.
mcdonald,
didn't
get
its
financing,
didn't
get
its
credit
based
on
the
fact
that
it
was
just
created
as
a
corporation.
it
was
john
mcdonald.
here,
you
have
the
situation
where...
and
it's
kind
of
a
unique
one...
where
there's
a
claim
that
john
mcdonald,
the
actual
person
who
was
being
discriminated
against,
can't
recover
but
some
other
entity
can.
that
sort
of
turns
section
1981
on
its
head.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
the--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
the
case
because
if
there
was,
for
example,
this
two
party
suit,
jwm
could
not
recover
for
dignitary
damages.
only
an
individual
can
do
that.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
i
don't
believe
you
can
do
it
under
a
general
contract--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--yes,
and
i
think
the...
the
case
law
indicates
that,
that
this
is
not
simply
just
federalization
of
state
law.
this...
looking
at
the
history
of
section
1981,
this
was
designed
to
combat
not
tortious
interference
claims
in
common
law,
but
the
black
codes
during
reconstruction
that
prohibited
black
individuals,
individuals
just
like
john
mcdonald,
from
being
able
to
pursue
their
trades,
operate--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--i
think
that
what
we
are
saying
i
think
is
what
the
court
has
said...
is
that
this
is
a
personal
injury,
and
that
dignitary
claims
are
subsumed
under
1981.
i
don't
think
it's
expand...
i
don't
think--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--no.
discrimination
is
a
personal
injury.
this
court
said
that
in
burke
and
i
believe
in
goodman
also.
so
we're
talking
about
personal
injury
here,
not
just
contract
harm.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
well,
it's--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--it's--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--i
believe,
your
honor--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--that
it
goes
to
your
right
to
not
suffer
discrimination
within
the
realm
of
making,
performing,
and
enforcing
contracts.
the
focus
is
on
discrimination,
which
is
a
personal
injury
and
a
personal
harm,
and
the--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--yes,
in
this
circumstance
where
the
contract
with
someone
else
was
the
mechanism
that
was
used
to
target
an
individual.
and,
again,
when
you're
dealing
with--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--if
there
is
a
circumstance,
as
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
where
there
is
blatant
and
intentional
discrimination,
racial
discrimination,
by
a
multinational
corporation
like
general
motors,
who
say
we're
not
going
to
do
business
with
any
company
that
hires
black
people...
and
clearly
there's
an
uphill
battle
for
any
kind
of
proof,
but
you'd
have
to
show
that
there
was
actual
targeting,
that
it
really
did
interfere
with
the
ability
to
perform
contracts,
and
that
there
were
specified
individual
damages.
but
if
that
were
the
case
and
could
be
proven,
that
would
be
pretty
egregious
and
probably
something
that
1981
should
cover.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
we're
saying
that
because--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--i
don't
believe
so,
and
i
think
that
what
was
pled
and
we
believe
is
not
just
the
wages
that
were
not
paid,
but
also
the
dignitary
damages
and
also
the
damages
specifically
aimed
at
john
mcdonald
in
terms
of
ruining
his
credit,
going
to
the
banks,
and
in
a
sense
slandering
him,
and
those
kinds
of
damages
that
were
not
recoverable
by
jwm
but
were
specifically
john
mcdonald.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
no,
sir.
there
were
actually
allegations
of
statements
we
are
going
to
ruin
you
personally
and
actions
that
went
to
ruin
him
personally.
this
was
not
just
simply
derivative
from
the
corporation.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
i
don't
believe
so,
sir.
and
the
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
talked
very
specifically
about
the
statements
to
the
banks
that
were
specific
to
john
mcdonald
that
hurt
john
mcdonald
individually
that
really
was
not
derivative
from
the
bankruptcy--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--well,
i
think
the
action
that
mr.
mcdonald
took
was
just
this,
the
1981
action,
saying
that
there
was
a
federal
violation,
that
this
was
done
to
discriminate
against
him,
and
this
seems
to
fit
in
with
the
1981
cause
of
action
and
the
purpose
of
1981,
which
is
why
this
case
was
filed.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
well,
again,
we...
i
think
we
could
look
at
shaare
tefila
as...
as
a
good
example
of
the
kinds
of
damages.
this
was
the
nazi
swastika
on
a
synagogue.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
well,
the
claim
was
still...
it
was
certainly
not
because
of
any
kind
of...
of
privity.
it
was
damages
based
on--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--well,
at
that
time,
that...
it
said
that
anti
semitism
counted
as
race,
but
certainly
they
were
able
to
recover
once
that
threshold
was
met
because
of
the
dignitary
harms.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
my
reading
of
that
was...
was
a
bit
broader
i
think.
also,
you
could
look
at
cases
such
as
sullivan
where
the
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
was
compensable
for
the
black
family
that
was
not
allowed
into
the
club.
so
the
cases
that
we
have
cited--
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
--correct.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
right.
but
this
court
has
said
that
the
language
is
so
similar
that
they
should,
for
these
purposes,
be
viewed
as
having
the
same
rules.
and
clearly,
it
would
make
no
sense
to
have...
have
different
ones.
so
they
were
1982
claims,
but
the
idea
that
discrimination
in
terms
of
housing
should
have
dignitary
claims,
as
well,
discrimination
in
terms
of
contract
should
not
is
something
this
court
has
never
accepted.
mr.
allen
lichtenstein
thank
you.
