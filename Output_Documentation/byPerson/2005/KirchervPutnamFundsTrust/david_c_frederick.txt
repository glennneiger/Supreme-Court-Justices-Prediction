mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
appealability
of
remand
orders
under
the
securities
litigation
uniform
standards
act,
or
slusa.
our
position
is
that
the
general
rule
prohibiting
appealability
applies
in
this
case
for
three
reasons.
first,
section
1447(d)
has
been
consistently
construed
to
prohibit
appeal
of
remand
orders
based
on
a
district
court's
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that
rule
governs
even
if
the
district
court
incorrectly
construes
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
provision.
second,
slusa
section
77p(c)
concededly
defines
removal
jurisdiction
and
it
does
so
by
incorporating
the
criteria
for
preemption.
thus,
the
court's
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
coextensive
with
those
cases
that
slusa
preempts.
and
third,
congress
knows
how
to
make
remand
orders
appealable
when
it
wants
to,
but
slusa
contains
no
provision
for
appellate
review
of
remand
orders.
under
respondent's
approach,
the
federal
courts
would
obtain
jurisdiction
in
cases
not
subject
to
slusa
preemption,
but
there's
no
indication
that
congress
intended
that
result.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
it's
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
under
this
court's
longstanding
precedent,
for
there
to
be
preclusion,
there
must
be
a
right
of
appellate
review.
so
if
you
agree
that
the
general
rule
of
1447(d)
applies
and
there
is
no
right
to
appeal
the
remand
order,
then
the
basis
on
which
that
order
is...
is
founded,
the
preemption
of
slusa
is
open
for
the
state
court
to
address
on
remand.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
through
the
state
court
system.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
he
was
wrong.
the
issue
of
preemption
under
slusa
can
be
raised
by
the
defendants
on
remand
in
the
state
courts.
it
can
be
litigated.
it's
important
to
note
that
the
removal
provision
says,
shall
be
removable.
it's
at
the
defendants'
discretion
whether
they
want
to
ask
the
federal
court
to
test
whether
slusa
preempts
the
case
or
to
keep
it
in
state
court
for
the
state
court
to
apply
slusa
and
thereby
hold
that
the
class
action
would
be
unsustainable.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
are
cases
in
the
lower
courts,
your
honor,
in
the
complete
preemption
area
that
have
held
that
a
removal
based
on
the
doctrine
of
complete
preemption
was
not
sustainable
because
the
case
was
not
completely
preempted,
but
holding
that
preemption,
implied
conflict
preemption,
can
be
applied
by
the
state
courts
on
remand.
and
it's
important
to
note
here
that
there--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--not
that
i'm
aware
of,
but
what
the
city
of
waco
case
says,
upon
which
they
base
their
reliance,
is
that
the
reason
why
there
was
appeal
of
that
particular
order
was
because
it
would
be
held
preclusive.
here,
it
would
not
be
held
preclusive
because
there
is
no
right
of
appellate
review.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
is
certainly
true,
although
i
would
take
issue
with
the
notion
of
there
being
a
colorable
claim.
i
don't
think
that
the
slusa
removal
is
analogous
to
the
federal
officer
removal
statute
where
the
statute
itself
says
the
defense
has
to
be
under
color
of
law,
and
this
court
in
the
mesa
v.
california
case
said
that
phrase
is
where
the
colorable
claim
creates
article
iii
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
i...
i
don't...
sorry.
if
i
could
just
finish.
i
don't
contest
the
rest
of
it,
which
is
that
on
remand,
preemption
can
be
developed
through
amended
pleadings,
through
facts
that
are
developed--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
under
their
theory,
though,
justice
ginsburg,
the
court
could,
because
of
their
construction
of
the
removal
jurisdiction
provision,
would
retain
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
and
we
think
that
that
position
that
they
have
advanced
in
this
court
is
incorrect,
and
i
would
agree
with
your
postulate
that
what
the
federal
district
court
does
and
it
has
jurisdiction
to
do
is
to
decide
whether
preemption
applies
and
then
remand
the
case,
or
if
preemption
does
apply,
to
dismiss
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
does...
it
does
do
that.
it's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
thought
i
expressed
my--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's...
on
the
basis
of
the
record
then
before
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
court
always
has
the
authority
to
have
evidence
taken
to
determine
its
own
jurisdiction.
that's
routinely
done
by
district
courts.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i...
i
agree
with
you
that
that
is
how
the
seventh
circuit
described
the
opinion
and
what...
what
the
adjudicatory
authority
was,
and
that
is
why
we
take
issue
with
the
seventh
circuit.
we
do
think
that
the
state
court
on
remand
has
any
issue
that
the
defendants
want
to
raise
before
it.
all
that
the
federal
district
court
has
done
is
to
decide
that...
that
there
was
no
basis
for
a
slusa
preemption
because
the
requisites
of
subsection
(b)
had
been
satisfied.
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
issue
before
you
is
whether
or
not
that
decision,
correct
or
not,
is
appealable.
and
what
is
important
in
the
error
of
the
seventh
circuit
was
that
they
held
that
that
decision
was
appealable,
and
under
the
thermtron
rule,
as
applied
in
gravitt
and
things
remembered,
even
a
district
court
decision
that
is
erroneous
in
its
construction
of
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
provision
is
still
a
remand
based
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
therefore
falls
within
the
four
corners--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
our
problem
with
that,
justice
breyer,
is
that
all
eight
district
court
decisions
here
thought
that
they
were
deciding
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
they
thought
that
because
federal
preemption
ordinarily
is
not
a
basis
for
removal.
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it...
it
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
functionally
it
is
the
equivalent
of
codifying
the
complete
preemption
doctrine,
which
is
how
slusa
actually
works.
and
in
the
complete
preemption
cases,
beneficial
bank
is
what
spells
out
this--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
would
be
a
strikingly
odd
result,
though,
for
this
court
to
reach
that,
given
that
congress
has
clearly
provided
for
appellate
review
of
remand
orders
in
other
contexts,
including
in
the
class
action
fairness
act,
under
tribal
property
disputes,
the
fdic,
the
rtc,
and
specifically
in
1447(d)
itself,
civil
rights
cases.
so
congress
knows
how
to
do
this
if
that's
what
congress
had
intended.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
think
that
the
closest
analogy,
again,
is
in
the
complete
preemption
area
where
the
court
has
held
that,
you
know,
the
removal
is
based
on
complete
preemption,
and
if
that
is
found
by
the
district
court,
that
functionally
terminates
the
litigation.
but
i
would
point
out
that
even
in
the
federal
officer
removal
statute,
there's
no
appellate
review
of
a
district
court's
decision
that
the
federal
officer
statute
was
improperly
invoked
to
remove
an
action.
so
what
the
securities
defendants
here
are
asking
for
is
something
congress
didn't
even
give
to
federal
officers.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
had
the...
it
had
the
power
to
determine
whether
slusa
applied.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
that's
what
section
77p(c),
when
it
says,
as
set
forth
in
subsection
(b),
is
referring
to.
so
the
district
court
analyzed
those
factors
and
it
came--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
the
courts
held
that
the
requisites
of
slusa
of
subsection
(b)
had
not
been
satisfied.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is
possible,
but
that's
why
the
issue
of
the
underlying
district
court's
determination
is
not
before
you.
the
issue
before
you
is
can
appellate
jurisdiction
be
asserted
to
review
that
decision.
but
i
would
further
point
out,
justice
stevens,
that
the
davit
court
assiduously
avoided
the
kinds
of
claims
that
are
present
in
our
case,
which
is
whether
or
not
negligence
can
be
asserted
against
the
securities
defendants
for
failure
to
fair
value
price.
dabit
was
strictly
a
fraud
case,
as
this
court
made
clear.
this
is
a
negligence
case,
and
there
is
a
part
of
subsection
(b)
which
makes
very
clear
that
what
slusa
is
getting
at
are
claims
based
on
fraud.
but
even
if
you
were
to
disagree
that
the...
the
district
court
had,
you
know,
an
alternate
basis
that
had
not
been
properly
ventilated
or
addressed
by
the
district
court
because
it
went
off
on
the
holder
theory
that
this
court
rejected
in
dabit,
you
still
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
because
of
the
general
rule
of
1447(d),
which
provides,
as
i
have
stated,
that
the
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
to
review...
appellate
review
of
a
remand
order.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
incorrect,
justice
ginsburg.
we've
put
the
complaints
before
you.
they
are
in
the
joint
appendix.
we
have
cited
every
paragraph
in
which
those
claims
are
asserted.
the
seventh
circuit
based
its
decision
about
that
on
a
misunderstanding
of
the
colloquy
at
oral
argument
in
the
seventh
circuit,
which
respondents
have
recited
the
web
site.
you
can
listen
to
the
argument
yourself.
it
did
not
contain
any
type
of
concession
by
counsel
for
the
class
that
these
claims
were
anything
other
than
the
negligence
claims,
which
on
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint,
they
assert
themselves
to
be.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
briefs
recounted
what
the
claims
are,
which
are
negligence
claims.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
seventh
circuit
made
five
crucial
errors,
that
it
was
wrong
to
describe
the
district
court
as
saying
that
removal
was
proper.
the
district
court
didn't
say
that.
they
were
wrong
to
say
that
the
remand
was
based
on
section
77(d)(4).
that's
not
what
the
district
court
did.
they
were
wrong
to
evaluate
section
77p(c)
without
even
reciting
or
construing
the
language.
they
were
wrong
to
say
that
slusa's
substantive
decisions,
quote,
must
be
made
by
the
federal
rather
than
the
state
judiciary.
that's
not
correct.
and
they
were
wrong
to
say
that
it
was
now
or
never
for
appellate
review
whether
an
action
under
state
law
is
preempted.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
the
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
this
is
on
a
basis
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it's
not
waivable
and
we're
permitted
to
say
that
a
district
court
decision
based
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
can
look
at
the
relevant
claims.
it
is
true
that
the
perception
at
the
time
was
that
these
holder
theories
evaded
slusa.
all
of
the
courts
up
until
that
time
of
kircher
ii
had
held
that,
and
that's
not
an
unreasonable
position
for
a
lawyer
to
take.
now,
certainly
after
dabit,
those
claims
are
foreclosed
where
there
are
holder
fraud
claims.
we
do...
we
obviously
don't
take
issue
with
that.
but
here,
the
claims
in
the
complaint
themselves
are
based
on
negligence,
and
it
is
certainly
fair--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
this
court
in
the
santa
fe
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
said
that
negligence
claims
are
not
within
10b-5.
those
are
claims
that
are
properly
brought
under
state
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
so
if
the...
if
the
state
court
applies
dabit
and
santa
fe,
it
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
holder
theory
is
preempted
under
dabit,
but
the
negligence
theory
is
not
preempted
under
the
santa
fe
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
does
come
up
often
because
the
securities
bar,
every
time
they
get
a
district
court
decision
that
they
don't
like,
they
want
to
appeal
it,
notwithstanding
the
general
bar
of
appealability.
so
this
issue
is
something
that
is
very
important
to
both
sides
in
the
development
of
this
law.
but
i
would
further
point
out,
justice
breyer,
that
as
this
case
has
come
up,
your...
your
view
would
have
to
be
based
on
do
you
have
appellate
jurisdiction,
and
our
submission
is
that
you
don't,
subject
for
purposes
of
remanding
the
case
in
light
of
dabit.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
in
the
cohill
case,
this
court
addressed
the
situation
where
there
was
a
federal
dismissal
of
the
claims
and
the...
and
the
federal
district
court
remanded
the
state
claims
for
consideration
under...
under
state
jurisdiction.
and
the
court
had
internal
discussion
about
whether
or
not,
you
know,
there
was
appealability
of
what
was
left
in
the
case.
our...
our
position
is
that
ordinarily
a
dismissal
of
a
federal
claim
is
an
appealable
matter
and
that
that
is
subject
to
appeal,
but
that
a
remand
decision,
which
is
what
the
district
court
made
in
this
case,
is
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
it
shouldn't
and
the
reason
it
shouldn't
is
because
congress
has
decided
that
it
shouldn't.
congress
has
decided
that
there
is
a
paramount
interest
in
having
decisions
made
on
their
merits,
which
is
why
there
is
not
appellate
review
of
remand
orders.
that's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
justice
alito,
to
the
contrary.
they
are
being
decided
by
federal
district
courts.
they're
just
no
subject
to
appellate
review,
and
it
was
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
well,
the...
the
merits
of
the
case
are
going
to
be
decided
by
the
state
court.
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
federal
defense
based
on
slusa
in
the
first
instance
is
decided
by
the
district
court
in
remanding
the
case,
and
then
if
there
becomes
a
basis
through
evidence
or
amendment
to
the
pleadings
or
whatnot,
if
the
defendants
want
to
re
raise
their
slusa
preemption
argument,
they
are
certainly
free
to
do
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
it
is
deciding.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is
decided
by
the
federal
court
within
the
confines
of
what
congress
has
determined
based
on
its
wording
of
slusa
and
its
fact
that,
as
this
court
has
said
in
things
remembered,
the
congress
is
presumed
to
accept
the
general
rule
of
nonappealability
unless
it
says
so.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'm
saying
that
it
is
final
for
purposes
of
remand.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
that
in
terms--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because...
because
what
slusa
does
is
it
has
an
interplay
between
the
removal
jurisdiction
provision
and
it
says,
as
set
forth
in
subsection
(b).
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
is
a
policy
choice
that
congress
made
when
not
providing
a
special
mechanism
for
appellate
review
of
remand
orders.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
and
that's
where
the
uniformity
of
decisions
would
come
from,
the
reviews
by
plaintiffs
who's
had
their...
who
have
had
their
cases
dismissed.
those
are
subject
to
appeal.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you.
i
think
it's
really
important
for
you
to
look
at
the
complaints
in
these
cases
because
every
single
one
of
them
asserts
claims
on
the
basis
of
negligence
and
the
value...
the
fair
value
pricing
of
the
securities.
they
are
not
based
on
misrepresentations.
the
other
side
has
attempted
to
make
them
look
like
misrepresentations,
and
they've
quoted
things
out
of
context
in
order
to
do
so.
but
the
complaints
themselves
are
pure
negligence
claims
that
would
fall
outside
of
slusa.
but
even
if
you
were
to
disagree
with
that
and
even
if
you
were
to
disagree
with
the
district
court's
basis
for
saying
that
remand
was
proper
because
it
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
general
rule
of
thermtron,
things
remembered,
and
importantly,
the
gravitt
case
applies.
and
this
court
does
not
have
appellate
jurisdiction.
the
seventh
circuit
does
not
have
appellate
jurisdiction
because
of
the
plain
language
of
section
1447(d).
respondents
concede
that
state
courts
can
decide
slusa
questions.
it
is
up
to
defendants
to
decide
whether
to
try
to
remove
them.
and
subsection
(d),
about
which
mr.
perry
spoke,
expressly
provides
that
certain
kinds
of
securities
actions
shall
be
remanded
because
congress
was
not
so
concerned
that
federal
courts
decide
everything
concerning
securities
cases,
but
only
as
to
those
that
are
expressly
set
forth
in
subsection
(b).
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
respectfully,
what
subsection
(c)
is
doing
with
its
references
to
subsection
(b)
are
to
incorporate
those
criteria
as
one
of
the
three
elements
or
criteria
for
removability.
it
has
to
be
a
covered
security,
has
to
be
a
covered
class
action,
and
it
has
to
meet
the
requisites
of
subsection
(b).
that's
the
only
reasonable
way
to
read
that.
and
the
last
clause
is
simply
confirmatory
that
if
those
are...
are
met,
then
the
district
court
has
to
find
that
the
case
shall
be
precluded.
in
the
gravitt
case,
in
which
this
court
through
a
per
curiam
dismissed
the
appeal,
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
over
whether
the
district
court
had
properly
applied
subject
matter
jurisdiction
principles
in
deciding
whether
or
not
there
was
diversity.
this
court
said,
no
matter.
that
is
outside
the...
the
requisite...
that
is
outside
1447(d),
and
the
general
rule
against
appealability
applies.
now,
importantly,
they
argue
that
they
would
be
precluded
by...
from
arguing
against
slusa
preemption
in
state
court,
but
in
fact,
the
last
brief...
the
last
page
of
our
brief,
our
reply
brief,
cites
the
standefer
case
in
which
this
court
held,
under
contemporary
principles...
and
i'm
quoting
now...
under
contemporary
principles
of
collateral
estoppel,
the
inability
to
pursue
an
appeal
is
a
factor
strongly
militating
against
giving
a
judgment
preclusive
effect.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
there
would
be.
and
there
would
be...
their
argument
about
the
missouri
pacific
case
is
wrong
because
what
the...
what
was
going
on
there
was
the
remand
determination,
not
the
underlying
federal
right.
and
that's
what
would
be
appealed,
and
there
would
also
be
appeal
of
the
preclusive
consequences
because
that
would
be
a
question
of
federal
law
under
this
court's
longstanding
determination.
the
restatement--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
would
be
covered.
and...
and
the
reason
is
that
it
is...
involved
a
manipulation.
the
wording
of
slusa
involves
a
manipulation
of...
of
the
security.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what...
what
we're
talking
about
here,
justice
stevens...
it's
important...
is
that
in
how
these
securities
get
priced,
was
there
negligence
in
the
pricing
of
those,
that
had
deleterious
effects
on
one
class
of
holders
but
not
on
market
timers
that
we
were
moving
in
and
out
of
the
market.
and
so,
frankly,
judge
easterbrook
was
wrong
for
a
sixth
reason,
and
that
was
in
saying
that
there
would
have
been
a
derivative
claim
here
too
because
a
derivative
case
has
to
be
brought
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
on
behalf
of
all
shareholders--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
district
court
was
wrong
in
not
anticipating
what
this
court
held
in
dabit,
but
it
was
not
wrong
insofar
as
it
held
that
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
this
case
is
based
on
negligence
and
not
fraud.
thank
you.
