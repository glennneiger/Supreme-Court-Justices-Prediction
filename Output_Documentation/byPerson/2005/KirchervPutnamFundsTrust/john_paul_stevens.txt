mr.
frederick,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
preliminary
question
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
case.
is
it
your
view...
when
the
petition
for
removal
was
filed,
did
the
district...
federal
district
court
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
preemption
issue
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the...
there...
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
to
entertain
the
removed
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then...
then
why...
then
how
can
you
say
the...
the
remand
was
based
on
lack
of...
of
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
they...
they
had
held
it
acting
on
an
interpretation
of
slusa
before
our
decision
in
dabit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
it
at
least
possible
that
they
would...
would
have
decided
that
issue
had
they
reviewed--
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
we
just...
can
i
ask
you
suppose
they
didn't
waive
it?
would
their...
would
their
position
have
any
merit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
the
question
just
a
little
differently.
suppose
the...
in
dabit,
we
decided
that
the
distinction
between
the
purchaser
seller
rule
and
the
scope
of
10b-5
did
not
prevent
slusa
from
preempting.
but
does
slusa
preempt
a
claim
that
is
beyond
the
scope
of
rule
10b-5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
because
i
hadn't,
frankly,
realized
the
importance
you
attach
to
the
missouri
pacific
case.
and
the
way
you
describe
it
as
saying
that
the...
the
state
court
cannot
be
held
to
have
decided
against
a
federal
right...
well,
anyway,
the...
the
point
is
there
are
two
things
that
are
decided
by
the
federal
court
when
it
remands
a
case.
one,
there
was
no
preemption,
and
two,
therefore,
there
shall
be
a
removal.
now,
as
i
understood
the
principle
underlying
that
case,
the...
the
correctness
of
the
remand
could
not
be
reviewed.
that's
litigated.
but
could
not
the
correctness
of
the
reason
given
for
the
remand,
namely
there
was
no
preemption,
be
removed
by
us
on
certiorari?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
their
theory,
but
it
seems
to
me
very
strange
to
say
that
we
could
not,
when
we
do
get
the
case
on
a
petition
for
certiorari...
couldn't
review
whether
it
was...
whether
it
was
in
fact
preemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
frederick?
because
it's
important
to
me.
would
you
agree
that
a
complaint
that
alleged
that
the
defendant
negligently
used
or
employed
manipulative
devices
and
so
forth
would
be
covered
by
slusa...
would
preempt
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
mere
fact
that
it's
negligently
caused
would
not
preclude
preclusion.
