chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
kircher
v.
putnam
funds
trust.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--how--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
it...
it
might
have
been
that
prior
to
dabit,
you
would
have
been
emphasizing...
or
whoever
would
have
been
emphasizing
the...
the
fraud
character
of...
of
the
claims,
and
after
dabit,
perhaps
the
negligence
boat
is
the
only
one
left
for
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
this
is
not
a
fair...
how
likely
is
it,
given
our
determination
in
dabit
about
how
congress
intended
to
treat
fraud
claims,
that
negligence
claims
are
going
to
fare
any
better?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
perry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and...
and
i
understand
your
submission...
and
perhaps
it's
distinct
from
the
seventh
circuit
holding
in
this
respect...
to
suggest
that
those
are
different
standards,
the
standard
for
removal
and
the
standard
for
preclusion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
under
your
view
at
least,
it's
possible
that
you
could
have
removal
jurisdiction
and
then
determine
that
the...
the
case
is
not,
in
fact,
preempted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so
that
an
entirely
state
law
case
would
proceed
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
another
instance
in
which
we've
upheld
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
a
purely
state
law
cause
of
action,
apart
from
the
federal
officer
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
those
are
the
only
two.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
would
be
a
pretty
unusual
creature
that
you're
asking
us
to
sanction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
reason
is
there
are
two
separate
questions.
they
just
happen
to
be
identical.
but
i
mean,
the
state
court
isn't
going
to
worry
about
whether
removal
is
appropriate
or
not.
it
doesn't
have
to
answer
that
question,
but
it
may
well
have
to
answer
the
question
whether
it's
preempted.
it
happens
to
be
the
same
analysis,
at
least
under
a
reading
of
the
statute,
but
that
doesn't
meant
that
you...
that
just
because
a
review
of
the
removal
decision...
the
remand
decision
is...
is
precluded,
that
review
of
the
preemption
decision
is
precluded.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel,
if
you...
on
the
removal
question,
if
there's
a
dispute
about
whether
it's
a
covered
class
action,
dispute
about
the
number
of
people
involved,
the
dollar
amount,
i
take
it
that
is
litigated
at
the
jurisdictional
stage?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
but
you
say
that
when
it
gets
to
whether
it's
a...
there's
a...
involving
a
covered
security,
for
some
reason
that
can't
be
litigated
at
the
jurisdictional
stage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
no
or
yes?
that
that
is
not
litigated
at
the
jurisdictional
stage?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that?
there...
it's
the
same
clause.
what
you
can
remove
is
a
covered
class
action
involving
a
covered
security.
so
why
do
we
have
such
different
approaches
to
the
different
prongs?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but...
but
i
still
don't...
and
this
gets
back
to
the
question
i
asked
before.
i
mean,
subsection
(c)
of
77p...
it's
unfortunate
we've
got
a
lot
of
subsection
(c)'s
here
but...
of...
of
slusa
incorporates
subsection
(b).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
says
what
can
be
removed
is
the
covered
class
action
involving
a
covered
security,
as
set
forth
in
subsection
(b).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
it
have
done
that?
that
would
have
been
a
waste
of
time.
i
mean,
you
just
say,
as
set
forth
in
subsection
(b).
you're
saying
if
they
had
repeated
subsection
(b)
there,
we'd
have...
the
case
would
come
out
the
other
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
perry.
mr.
frederick,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
05-409,
kircher
versus
putnam
funds
trust.
