justice
antonin
scalia
under
your
approach,
mr.
frederick,
the
federal
court
would
decide
the
principal
substantive
issue
in
the
case,
the
principal
legal
issue,
nonfactual
perhaps,
and
then
decide
that
is
has
no
jurisdiction
if
it
finds
that
it
doesn't
come
within...
within
(c),
sends
it
back
to
the
state
court.
is...
is
the
state
court
bound
by...
by
that
finding
by
the
federal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
any
cases
that...
that
are
like
this
one
which
are
like
this
one
which
involve
not
just
res
judicata
of...
of
the...
of
the
finding
by
the
federal
court,
but
the
law
of
the
case?
i
mean
this
is
the
same
case
when
it's
remanded.
you've
already
had
a
court
that
has
found
a
particular
element
with
respect
to
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
highly
unusual
to
have
the
same
issue
in
the
same
case
then
decided
by
a
second
court.
do
you
have
any...
any
parallel?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
any
case
of
ours,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
preemption
applies
or
whether
there's
a
colorable
basis
for
saying?
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
the
district
court
decides
whether
preemption
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't...
you
don't
agree
with
what
justice
souter
was
saying,
that
all
it's...
all
it's
making
is
a
colorable
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he's
right
that
it's
ultimately
not
decided
by
the
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
the
federal
court
makes
a
decision
which
is
not
binding
in
the
case.
that
decision
can
be
undone
by
the
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
understand
that.
can
you
answer
my
question?
you...
you
were
saying
that
the...
that
the
decision
by
the
federal
court
on
this
issue
is
not
final.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
it
is
not
final--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
purposes
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
as
long
as
you
say
that,
the
point
that...
that
justice
alito
makes
is...
is
well
taken,
that
we...
we
thought
that
this
was
a...
a
statute
designed
to
have
the
federal
courts
determine
this
issue,
and
it
turns
out
that
the
federal
court
just
takes
the
first
swing
at
it,
and
if
a
state
court
disagrees,
it's...
it's
free
to
do
so.
