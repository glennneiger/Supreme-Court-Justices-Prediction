justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
for
this
court,
i
assume,
at
least
theoretically,
on
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
was
the
basis
then,
or
was
there
a
basis,
for
judge
easterbrook's
comment,
it's
now
or
never?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
have
a
standard--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
best
case
on
that
is
munsingwear?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
the
missouri
pacific
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on...
on
the
merits
of
the
issue
as
opposed
to
diversity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
part
of
the
dynamic
here,
mr.
perry,
that
if
this
goes
back
to
the
state
court,
that
affects
the
dynamics
of
the
litigation
because
you
now
have
a
class
action
that
has
to
proceed,
and
that
a
large
part
of
the
litigation
strategy
in
these
cases
is
determined
by
whether
or
not
there's
going
to
be
a
full
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
class
action
to
effect
a
settlement,
and
so
forth,
so
that
congress
wanted
to
have
this
reviewed
quickly
and
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
there
would
be
federal
court
review
in
this
court
from
a
state
court
determination
on
the
applicability
of
slusa
in
this
case?
