justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
aren't
you...
aren't
you
urging
a
very
strange
result
that
the...
the
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
slusa
preclusion
issue
should
be
decided
by
the
state
courts
when
the
whole
purpose
of...
of
that
provision
was
to
take
matters
out
of
the
state
courts
because
there
was
a
view
in
congress
that
they
were
not
being
handled
properly
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
you
said
the
merits
of
the
issue
was
not
going
to
be
decided
by
the
federal
court.
