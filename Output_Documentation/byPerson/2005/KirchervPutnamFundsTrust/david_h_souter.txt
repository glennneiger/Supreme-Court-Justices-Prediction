justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is...
is
there...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i...
i
had
thought
there
was
an...
an
easier
answer,
and
that
is
that
the...
the
decision
that
ultimately
the
state
court
will
make,
as
to
whether
there
is
or
is
not
preclusion,
is
not
identical
to
the
decision
that
the
federal
court...
that
the
district
court
makes
on
the
motion
for
remand
because
on
the...
and
this
is
the
way
i
was
going
about
it.
on
the
motion
for
remand,
all
a
federal
court
decides
is
whether,
in
fact,
there
is
a
colorable
basis
for
the
removal.
when
it
goes
back,
if
it
does
go
back,
to
the
state
court,
there
will
be
an
opportunity
not
to
go
merely
to
the
stage
of
colorable
basis,
but
to
litigate
it
ultimately
on
the
merits.
so...
so
that
what
we
have
is
a...
in
effect,
a
kind
of
quick
look
finding
at
the
federal
level,
and
that
does
not
preclude
a...
a
complete
development
of
the
issue
on
the
merits
in
the
state
court,
if
that's
where
it
goes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
do
you
take
the
position--
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you
take
the
position
that...
and...
and
you
may
well
be
right,
but
i
mean,
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
a
complete
determination
on
the
merits
at
the...
at
the
stage
at
which
the
district
court
rules
on
the
motion
to
remand.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
on
the
basis
of
the
record
then
before
it.
i
mean,
they
can...
they
can...
can
they
put
in
any
evidence
they
want?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the...
isn't
the
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
in
those
cases
in
which
congress
has
provided,
we...
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
the...
the
removal
or
not,
the
preemption
or
not
is
the
end
of
the
litigation.
here,
we've
got
a
case
in
which
there...
there
are
basically
two
kinds
of
preemption,
as...
as
you've
recognized.
there
is...
there
is
regular
preemption,
on
the
basis
of
which
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
removal,
and
there
is
a
preclusion
of
any
litigation
whatsoever.
and
in
the
cases
in
which
congress
has
made
specific
provision,
were
they...
the
instances...
were
they
instances
in
which
it
was
the
second
issue
which
precluded
any
litigation
whatsoever?
the
answer
may
be
yes.
i
just
don't
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
say
it
is
not...
why
do
you
say
that
it
cannot
be
examined
in
state
court
if
there's
no
appeal
in
the
federal
forum?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
you
wouldn't
be
stuck
with
it.
i
mean,
that
would
be
a
federal
preclusion
decision
and
that
would
ultimately
be
reviewable
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
don't
understand
that.
why
can't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
we
would
have
to
overrule
missouri
pacific?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in...
in
any
case,
munsingwear
turned
on...
not
on
the
availability
of...
of
an
appeal
generally,
but
on
the
mootness
of
the
case.
in
other
words,
munsingwear
said,
look,
your
case
disappeared,
and
the...
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
the
order
you
don't
like
is...
is
vacatur.
and
if
you
didn't
take
that
opportunity
to
get
rid
of
it,
then
the...
the
decision
that
was
made
survives,
and
that
gets
preclusive
effect.
it...
it
doesn't...
munsingwear
would
not
apply
of
its
own
force
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
here,
what
is
set
out
in
subsection
(b)
is
exactly
the
reason
for
congress'
wanting
to
place
these
restrictions
on
it,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
sensible
reason
for
reading
it
the
way
your...
your
brother
on
the
other
side
does.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
another
gripping
decision.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
7th
circuit.
the
securities
litigation
uniform
standards
act
precludes
certain
private
state
law
securities
class
actions,
so-called
"covered"
class
actions,
from
being
brought
in
either
state
or
federal
court.
besides
the
preclusion
provision,
the
act
has
a
removal
provision,
which
allows
a
defendant
to
remove
to
federal
court
any
covered
class
action
brought
in
any
state
court
involving
a
covered
security,
as
set
forth
in
the
act's
preclusion
provision.
the
petitioners
are
mutual-fund
investors
who
filed
actions
in
state
court
raising
state-law
claims.
each
sought
to
represent
a
class
of
investors
allegedly
injured
by
devaluation
of
their
holdings
by
respondents'
mutual
funds.
the
funds
filed
notices
of
removal
for
federal
district
court,
but
the
district
court
decided
that
it
lacked
subject-matter
jurisdiction
on
removal,
because
the
investors'
claims
were
not
precluded
by
the
act,
and
for
that
reason
it
remanded
each
case
to
state
court.
the
funds
then
filed
notices
of
appeal,
and
the
7th
circuit
issued
an
opinion
addressing
whether
it
had
appellate
jurisdiction
in
light
of
a
statutory
provision,
28
u.s.
code
1447(d),
that
bars
appellate
review
of
a
remand
order
if
the
order's
basis
is
a
lack
of
subject-
matter
jurisdiction.
the
7th
circuit
decided
it
did
have
appellate
jurisdiction
to
review
the
remand
order
notwithstanding
ยง1447(d),
because
the
district
court's
remand
was
not,
in
fact,
based
on
a
lack
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
all
covered
class
actions
involving
covered
securities
are
removal
under
the
act,
and
the
district
court's
preclusion
determination
in
substantive
and
separate
from
the
jurisdictional
determination
whether
the
case
was
properly
removed
at
all.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
want
of
jurisdiction
on
its
part.
section
1447(d)
bars
review
of
remand
orders
based
on
a
lack
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction,
no
matter
how
plainly
the
remanding
court
was
mistaken
in
its
jurisdictional
ruling.
in
this
case,
the
remand
orders
were
based
on
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
under
the
act's
removal
provision,
and
we
think
the
district
court
was
correct
in
understanding
that
the
reason
for
its
remand
order
was
a
provision
governing
removal
jurisdiction.
unlike
the
court
of
appeals,
we
think
that
to
remove
a
case
under
the
act,
the
case
must
not
only
be
a
covered
class
action
involving
a
covered
security,
it
must
also
be
a
case
precluded
by
the
act.
the
removal
provision
describes
removable
cases
as
covered
class
actions,
and
i
quote,
"as
set
forth
in
subsection
(d)",
end
of
quote,
the
preclusion
provision;
and
that
language
has
no
apparent
function
unless
it
limits
removal
to
actions
involving
claims
that
are
actually
precluded.
because
removal
jurisdiction
under
the
act
is
restricted
to
precluded
actions,
a
motion
to
remand
claiming
the
action
is
not
precluded
poses
a
jurisdictional
issue.
a
district
court's
decision
of
that
issue
is
simply
the
exercise
of
its
authority
to
determine
its
own
jurisdiction
to
deal
further
with
the
case,
and
when
a
district
court
remands
because
it
has
decided
a
claim
is
not
precluded
by
the
act,
1447(d)
forbids
appellate
review
of
the
order
implementing
that
decision.
we
add
that
the
act
does
not
give
federal
courts
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
preclusion
decisions.
a
state
court
may
decide
a
preclusion
issue
in
the
first
instance
if
a
case
is
not
removed,
and
it
may
decide
the
preclusion
issue
now,
when
these
cases
return
to
state
court.
collateral
estoppel
should
not
bar
revisitation
of
the
preclusion
issue,
precisely
because
of
the
fund's
inability
to
appeal
the
district
court's
decision
here.
the
state
court
is
free
to
reject
the
remanding
court's
reasoning,
and
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
state
court
will
duly
apply
our
recent
holding
in
the
case
of
merrill
lynch,
pierce,
fenner
&
smith
against
dabit,
where
we
disallowed
the
interpretation,
giving
the
act's
preclusion
provision,
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
