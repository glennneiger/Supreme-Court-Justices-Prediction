justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
must
take
issue
with
the
this
is
only
a
quick
determination,
unless
you
also
agree
with...
disagree
with
justice...
judge
easterbrook
when
he
said,
the
decision
for
the
federal
court
is
only
two
things.
it's
either
remand
or
dismiss
the
action.
that
is,
the
federal
court
under
no
circumstances
will
keep
this
case
for
trial.
either
it
will
dismiss
it
outright
or
it
will
remand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that
was
not...
certainly
not
the
seventh
circuit's
understanding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
the
seventh
circuit's
fix
on
this
case
was
that
the
federal
courts
have
adjudicatory
authority
to
do
one
thing
and
to
do
that
one
thing
finally,
that
is,
to
decide
whether
this
is
a
case
that
cannot
be
brought
in
any
court
or
whether
it's
a
case
that
congress
has
left
over
for
the
states
still
to
deal
with.
that
was
the
whole
theory
of
the
seventh
circuit,
that
this
is
no
quick
look.
the...
the
federal
courts
are
making
a
final
determination.
and
i
think
that
would
exclude
what
justice
souter
has
suggested.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
will...
would
you
please
explain
something
to
me
that
you
just
said?
you
said
that
our
complaint
isn't
about
fraud.
it
isn't
about
deception.
it's
about
negligence.
but
the
seventh
circuit
reported
and
seemed
to
have
no
doubt
about
it
that
the
complaints
in
this
set
of
cases
were
based
on
allegations
of
deceit
and
manipulation,
not
mismanagement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
seventh
circuit
said
precisely,
in
particular,
they
did
not
argue
in
their
briefs
and
did
not
maintain
at
oral
argument,
despite
the
court's
invitation
that
their
suits
allege
mismanagement
rather
than
deceit
or
manipulation.
so
is
that
totally
wrong,
that
you
did
do
it...
mention
it
in
your
briefs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
how
could
the
seventh
circuit
have
gotten
it
that
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
course,
if
the
federal
district
court
says
there
is
preclusion,
therefore,
case
dismissed,
that
would
be
reviewable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
can
always
amend
the
complaint
and
pare
it
down
and
say
now...
we...
we
complained
all
along
about
negligence.
now,
judge,
we
are
complaining
about
mismanagement
on
the
defendants'
part,
nothing
more.
no
manipulation.
cut
out...
they
could
have
such
a
complaint,
and
would
that
be
precluded
if...
if
they
started
afresh
in
the
state
court
and
they
said,
we
are
complaining
about
mismanagement?
we're
not
charging
anyone
with
fraud
or
deception.
couldn't...
isn't
that
a
viable
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then,
mr.
perry,
there's
a
whole
case.
see,
what's
peculiar
about
this
is
congress
says
it's
not
really
preemption.
i
think
justice
stevens
pointed
that
out
in
dabit.
it
is
preclusion.
it
says
this
action
shall
not
exist.
period.
not
as
a
state
claim,
not
as
a
federal
claim.
and
it
wanted
the
federal
courts
to
monitor
that
determination.
it
surely
didn't
want...
if...
if
the
state
claim
is
outside
that
preclusion,
didn't
want
the
federal
courts
to
sit
and
have
a
whole
trial
on
what
is
a
non
diverse,
no
federal
question
case.
i
mean,
it
just
seems...
if
you're
going
to
imagine
what
congress
wouldn't
want
in
the
federal
courts,
that
would
be
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
there
you
must
admit
that
you
are
departing
from
judge
easterbrook
because
judge
easterbrook
said
this
statute
gives
the
federal
court
adjudicatory
authority
to
do
one
thing,
to
decide
whether
there's
preemption
or
preclusion
or,
if
not,
then
to
remand.
so
they
make...
they
make
one
determination
and
bow
out
he
said.
and
you're
telling
us,
no,
they
don't
bow
out.
they
can,
if
they
want
to,
keep
the
state
law
claim
and
adjudicate
it
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i'm
simply
asking
about
the
seventh
circuit's
understanding
of
the
case.
it
says,
after
making
the
decision
that
77p(b)
requires,
the
district
court
has
nothing
else
to
do.
dismissal
and
remand
are
the
only
options.
so
judge
easterbrook
or
the
seventh
circuit
clearly
did
not
think
that
there
was
any
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
a
state
law
claim
to
be
made.
he
said
it
twice.
one
is
at
14a
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
the
other
is
11a.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
don't
think
that
any
of
those
cases
are
comparable,
in
that
the
removed
case
is
going
to
be
tried
someplace.
take
a
diversity
case.
the
federal
court
has
to
decide...
and
it's
removed...
whether
the
parties
are
really
diverse.
if
it
decides
that
they
are
really
diverse,
it
keeps
the
case
and
it's
adjudicated
in
federal
court.
if
it
decides
they're
not,
the
case
is
adjudicated
in
the
state
court.
but
here,
the
determination
is,
is
there
a
claim
to
be
tried
anyplace?
and
if
there
is
preclusion
under
slusa,
then
it's
not
a
question
of,
as
judge
easterbrook
put
a
menu,
where
is...
it's
not
a
where
question.
it's
a
whether
question.
and
so
that
makes...
makes
slusa
quite
different
from
other
cases
where
the...
the
case
is
going
to
be
tried
someplace.
here,
the
decision
to
be
made
is,
is
this
going
to
be
tried
or
not?
is
it...
is
it
a
claim
or
is
not
a
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but...
but
there
is
also
exceptions
to
the
rule
of
claim
and
issue
preclusion,
and
when
you
don't
have
an
opportunity
to
appeal
because
the
system
doesn't
let
you
appeal,
then
you
can
say,
judge,
don't
give
this
preclusive
effect.
i
did
not
have
that
full
and
fair
opportunity
because
i
was
unable
to
appeal.
and
i
think
that
that's
solid
preclusion
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
a
nassau
county
court
could
say,
we're
not
going
to
treat
that
as
preclusive.
they
didn't
have
a
fair
chance
to
appeal.
and
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
any
case,
you
said
easterbrook
made
only
one
mistake.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
made
another
one
when
he
said,
it's
now
or
never
for
appellate
review.
that
preclusion
question
could
come
to
this
court
if
it
went...
the
case
went
back
and
the
nassau
county
said,
well,
i'm
going
to
follow
the
federal
court,
i'm
not
going
to...
at
the
end
of
the
road,
the
preclusion
question
would
be
open
for
this
court
to
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
now
or
never.
the
question
is
not
can
you...
is
there
an
appeal
or
does
1447(d)
bar
it.
the
question
is
whether
an
action
under
state
law
is
preempted.
and
suppose
this
case
had
gone
along
in
the
federal...
in
the
state
court,
and
the
defense
of
preclusion
is
made
in
the
state
court.
the
state
court
could
certainly
decide
that
question.
nobody
removed
it.
so
the
state
court
has
competence
to
decide
that
question,
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in...
this
court
could
decide
it
on
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
a
case
where
there
was
no
possibility
of
reviewing
the
decision
of
the
court
of
first
instance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're...
you're
positing
a...
a
state
court
that's
going
to,
by
golly,
give
that
federal
decision
preclusive
effect
even
though,
say,
the
restatement
of
judgments
says...
now
if
a
decision
didn't...
if
there
was
no
opportunity
for
review,
then
that's
a
ground
for
refusing
preclusive
effect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
munsingwear
was
about
mootness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
if
the
litigant
asks
to
have
it
vacated
under
munsingwear,
the
litigant
would
be
entitled
to
have
it
vacated.
so
it
was
a
foot
fault
and
the...
the
court
held
the
counsel
to
the
mistake
that
had
been
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
answer
the
argument,
the
third
argument,
that
mr.
frederick
stressed
that
is,
that
congress
provided
specifically
in
the
class
action
fairness
act,
a
couple
of
other
acts,
and
1447
itself
with
respect
to
civil
rights
actions
removable
under
1443?
in
all
those
cases,
it
provided
specifically
for
review
of
remand
decisions,
and
here
the
silence
is
deafening.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
know
what...
what
congress'
knowledge
about.
thermtron
was
a
district
judge
who
said,
they
removed
this
case,
but
i'm
much
too
busy.
this
court
is
much
too
busy
to
mess
with
stuff
that
belongs
in
the
state
court.
i'm
remanding
it.
that
was
just
too
much,
and
the
federal
court--
