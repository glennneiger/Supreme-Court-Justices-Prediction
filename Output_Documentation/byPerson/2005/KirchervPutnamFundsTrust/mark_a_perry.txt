mr.
mark
a.
perry
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
was
quite
a
litany
of
errors
that
judge
easterbrook
is
alleged
to
have
committed
in
this
case.
i
would
submit,
your
honors,
he
committed
none.
judge
easterbrook
correctly
recognized
that
the
only
issue
put
into
play
by
these
petitioners
was
the
dabit
question.
in
their
motion
to
remand
this
docket,
docket
number
20
in
the
kircher
case,
they
said,
it
is
the
fourth
requirement,
the
in
connection
with
requirement,
which
is
at
issue
in
the
present
case.
we
pointed
out
in
every
subsequent
brief
that
they
had
waived
all
other
issues,
and
they
never
responded
to
that
waiver.
it
is
that,
justice
ginsburg,
to
which
judge
easterbrook
was
responding
when
he
said
plaintiffs
never
argued
in
their
briefs
and
they
did
not
maintain
an
argument
that
any
other
requirement--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--no,
your
honor.
their
complaint
rests
on
two
factors
that
are
clearly
within
slusa.
first,
misrepresentations.
they
claim
that
our
prospectuses
misled
them
into
investing
in
these
mutual
funds
and
then--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
slusa
precludes
precisely
what
subsection
(b)
says
it
precludes,
which
is
beyond
the
scope
of
10b-5.
for
example,
10b-5
requires
scienter.
slusa
has
no
scienter
requirement.
so
a
non
scienter
based
state
law
claim
is
still
precluded
under
slusa.
what
slusa
requires
is
a
misrepresentation,
omission,
manipulation,
or
deceptive
device
in
connection
with
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
period.
all
of
that
is
present
in
this
complaint.
they
allege
omissions.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
in
this
case
they
could
not
amend
their
complaint
because
the
federal
jurisdiction
is
determined
on
the
complaint
that
we
removed.
and
at
the
time
of
removal,
it
was
clearly
precluded
by
slusa.
and
the
court's
cases
are
very
clear
that
a
plaintiff
may
not
amend.
for
example,
you
can't
lower
the
amount
in
controversy
below
$75,000
to
get
back
to
state
court.
at
the
time
of
removal,
the
federal
court
both
had
jurisdiction
over
this
case
and
it
was
clearly
precluded
under
slusa.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
i
think
we're
the
same
as
the
seventh
circuit.
we
may
have
articulated
it
slightly
different,
but
yes,
they
are
different
standards.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
the
answer
is
yes.
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
removal
jurisdiction
because
the
defense
is
colorable,
there
may
be
a
factual
issue
as
to
whether
the
in
connection
with
requirement
is
met.
in
10b-5
cases,
it's
not
uncommon
that
that
is
a
factual
question,
not
a
legal
question.
the
federal
court
would
then
retain
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
question
on
summary
judgment,
at
trial,
or
whatever.
it
won't
know
until
it
finally
disposes
of
the--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--you
have
the
federal
officer
situation
and
you
have
the
fsia,
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
no,
your
honor.
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
creature
that
happens
every
time
congress
makes
a
case
removable
on
the
basis
of
a
federal
defense.
every
time
congress
does
that,
which
is
not
very
often,
the
court
has
held
that
the
colorable
defense
is
sufficient
to
invest
the
federal
court
with
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
ginsburg,
three
answers.
first,
congress
wanted
federal
courts
to
make
the
decision,
not
monitor
the
decision.
second,
we
agree
the
federal
court
has
the
power
to
remand
the
case.
if
all
that's
left
is
state
law
claims,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
keep
it.
and
third,
that
is
what...
the
regime
that
congress
set
up
was
designed
because
there
is
a
risk
of
error.
some
district
courts
will
get
some
slusa
preclusion
questions
wrong.
and
the
question
before
this
court
really
is
would
congress
have
wanted
those
cases
to
stay
in
the
federal
courts
subject
to
federal
appellate
review
or--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
judge
easterbrook
read
section...
subsection
(d)(4)
to
require
remand.
petitioners
and
respondents
are
in
agreement
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
that
(d)(4)
does
not
apply
to
the
remand
in
this
case.
it
only
applies
to
remands
for
expressly
exempted
actions.
the...
(d)(4),
it
says,
shall
be
remanded.
the
corollary
to
that,
we
would
submit,
is
that
where
congress
recognizes
that
certain
cases
shall
be
remanded,
even
though
they're
within
the
removal
jurisdiction,
other
cases,
such
as
this
one,
may
be
remanded.
otherwise,
congress
could
have
said
all
cases
that
are
not
precluded
shall
be
remanded.
and...
and,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
not
as
counterintuitive
as...
as
i
think
petitioners
are
trying
to
make
it
seem
because
there
may
be
federal
issues
that
continue
past
the
preclusion--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--and,
justice
ginsburg,
the
reason
he
said
that
was
because
of...
of
section...
subsection
(d)(4),
which
is
quoted
in
full
at
the
top
of
page
12a
of
the
petition
appendix.
that
is
because
the
second
circuit
had
held
that
(d)(4)
applies
to
remands
in
this
situation,
and
both
petitioners
and
respondents
in
their
seventh
circuit
briefing
took
that
position.
when
we
got
to
this
court
and
we
both
looked
harder
at
the
statutory
scheme,
we
both
realized
that
we
were
wrong.
therefore,
judge
easterbrook...
you
know,
the
one
mistake
he
made
was
the
one
we
led
him
into
making.
but
that
doesn't
change
the
validity
of
his
jurisdictional
analysis,
which
is
to
say
that
the
only
requirement
of
slusa
that
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
on
removal
is
whether
this
is
a
covered
class
action.
the
elements
of
the
preclusion
defense
are
then
the
substantive
question
of
federal
law
that
congress
authorized
the
federal
court
to
make,
and
it
authorized
the
federal
court
to
make
final.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
no,
justice
breyer.
both
sides
agree
that
slusa,
section
77p(d)(4)--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
breyer,
i
disagree
respectfully.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
if
it
is
a
covered
class
action,
that
is,
50
plaintiffs
and
so
forth--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--it
is
removable
and
within
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
so
long
as
the
defendant
has
presented,
either
on
the
complaint
or
in
the
removal
papers,
a
colorable
defense
of
preclusion.
only--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--an
allegation
by
the
plaintiff
as
elaborated
on
by
the
removal
notice,
if
necessary,
because
where
congress
has
waived
the
well
pleaded
complaint
rule,
the
removal
court
will
look
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint
to
include
affidavits
and
other
materials
provided
by
the
defendant.
that
has
always
been
held
the
case
in...
in
the
rare
instances
where
congress
has
made
a
federal
defense
removable.
the
court
said
that
in
the
franchise
tax
board
case,
for
example,
and
it's
well
supported
by
history
from
the
1870's--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--i
entirely
agree
with
you,
judge...
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
that
supports
judge
easterbrook's
opinion.
in
the
where
will
it
be
tried
case,
the
lack
of
appellate
review
is
less
important
because
the
merits
of
the
case
will
go
to
state
court
and
up
through
the
system,
and
any
federal
issues
can
reach
this
case.
in
the
slusa
case,
where
the
district
court
erroneously,
as
we
know
the
district
court
erroneously
did
here,
denies
the
preclusion
and
sends
the
case
back
to
state
court,
that
is
a
final
determination
of
federal
law
that
we
submit
is
not
reviewable
in
state
court
and
can't
be
reviewed
by
this
court
up
on
review
through
the
state
system.
so
that--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
this
court
has
always
held
and
reiterated
in
the
munsingwear
case
that
where
a
collateral
estoppel
attaches
because
an
issue
has
been
fully
and
finally
litigated
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
between
the
same
parties,
that
the
availability
of
an
appeal--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--does
affect
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
ginsburg,
this
court
has
never
held
that
an
appeal
is
required
to
give
collateral
estoppel
effect.
therefore,
on
remand,
the
court
could...
the
madison
county
state
court
could
give
collateral
estoppel
effect.
in
fact,
i
expect
petitioners
would
argue
precisely
that.
and
no
decision
of
this
court
stands
as
a
barrier
to
that.
the
court
would
have
to
change
preclusion
law
to
say
that
the
lack
of
an
appeal
is
a
prerequisite
to
appeal.
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
that
it
can
be
taken
into
account
by
a
court,
but
it
does
not--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--and
if
they
came
out
the
other
way
and
said,
i
am
going
to
treat
it
as
preclusive,
because
the
supreme
court
says
you
don't
have
to
have
a
right
to
appeal,
we'd
be
stuck
with
that.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
that...
that
decision
would
be
reviewable
here,
your
honor.
it's
an
unnecessary
multiple
layers
of
appeals
and
going
through
the
state
system
to
decide
a
federal
question
that
congress
wanted
to
have
decided
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
only
one
mistake.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg.
the...
if
the
state
court
gave
preclusive
effect
to
the
federal
court
judgment,
the
preclusion
question
would
be
open
to
question...
the
collateral
estoppel
question
would
be
open
to
review.
but
the
substance
of
the
remand
order
would
not
be.
it
would
still
be
barred
by
1447(d),
if
petitioners
are
right,
and
this
court
held
exactly
that
in
the
missouri
pacific
railroad
case
in
1896
and
has
never
revisited
that.
so
that
we
cannot
get
the
slusa
issue
back
to
the
state
system.
judge
easterbrook
was
exactly
right.
it
is
now
or
never,
your
honor.
and
congress
certainly
could
not
have
expected
on
an
issue
of
this
magnitude
where
it
passed
a
law
3
years
after
the
pslra--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
in
a
non
removed
case,
yes.
petitioners'
theory,
though,
is
if
this
is
a
1447(d)
bar,
and
it
was
removed
to
federal
court,
decided
that
it
was
not
precluded
by
slusa
and
remanded
it,
this
court
could
not
review
it
directly
or
indirectly,
could
not
review
the
issue
of
slusa
preclusion
decided
by
the
federal
court.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
no,
your
honor.
our
case
on
that,
where
the
court
held
exactly
that,
is
missouri
pacific
railroad
v.
fitzgerald.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
a
case--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--on
the
merits
of
the
final
judgment
in
the
case,
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
state
court
could
decide
that.
it's
not--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
breyer,
we
would
certainly
hope
that
if
petitioners
were
to
prevail
on
the
1447(d)
issue,
this
court
would
make
clear
both
that
we
could
relegate
the
question
to
state
court
and
bring
it
to
this
court.
what
we
are
saying
is
under
the
current
state
of
this
court's
law,
laid
out
in
our
brief
and
not
challenged
in
any
regard
by
petitioners,
that
is
not
obviously
the
case,
so
that
we
are
left
with
the
fact
that
a
state
court
could
give
preclusive
effect
to
an
obviously
wrong
federal
judgment
that
could
not
be
reviewed
in
this
court.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
i
think
you
would
have
to
clarify
at
least
that
missouri
pacific
does
not
apply
to
slusa
removals
and
remands,
justice
souter.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
correct,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--not
under
petitioners'
theory,
your
honor,
because
their
theory
is
that
the
inquiries
are
completely
and
totally
coextensive.
the
jurisdictional
inquiry,
the...
the
remand
inquiry
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
preclusion
inquiry.
our
position
is
that--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
i'd
submit
that
it's
very
strange
that
this
would
not
be
just
reviewable
straight
up
through
the
federal
system,
as
judge
easterbrook
and
the
seventh
circuit
correctly
held.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
that...
that
may
well
be
a
fair
distinction
of
the
missouri
pacific
case.
we
come
to
the
court
today
with
the
law
as
it
stands
and
not
knowing
whether
such
a
distinction
will
be
drawn
in
the
future--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--if...
if
it
works
the
same
way
with
slusa,
such
could
be
the
law.
the
court
certainly
has
the
opportunity
to
clarify
that.
again,
i'll
return
to
the
simpler
way--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--and
in...
and
in
munsingwear,
your
honor,
the
united
states
cited
that
precise
provision
of
the
restatement
of
judgments
to
this
court,
and
six
justices
of
this
court
held,
no,
if
there's
no
appeal,
we
are
still
going
to
give
this
judgment
collateral
estoppel
effect.
certainly
a
state
court
would
not
be
unreasonable
in
following
this
court's
lead,
since
this
court
has
never
retreated
from
that
statement.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
it
was
about
mootness
and
the
result
of
the...
the
government's
complaint
there
was
that
it
was
going
to
have
to
live
with
the
collateral
estoppel
effects
of
the
judgment.
one
of
the
arguments
they
made
was,
well,
because
we
can't
get
an
appeal,
we
won't
be
bound,
and
the
court
disagreed
with
that
en
route
to
saying,
and
to
avoid
that
problem,
precisely
that
problem,
you
should
have
asked
for
vacatur.
but
since
the
solicitor
general
didn't
do
it,
the
court...
the
decision
stood
and
it
had
collateral
estoppel
effect.
that...
that
is
the
holding
of
munsingwear,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
well,
munsingwear
reaffirmed
johnson
v.
wharton
which
said
that
where
congress
takes
away
the
right
to
appeal,
there
is
still
collateral
estoppel
effect
of
the
district
court
judgment.
that...
that
was
the
previous
decision
that
munsingwear
affirmed.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
the...
the
holding
of
munsingwear
is
that
johnson
v.
wharton
is
good
law,
and
a
court
need
not
give...
may
give
preclusive
effect
to
a
case
without
an
appeal.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
if
the
court
would
like
to
change
that
law,
it's...
it's
up
to
this
court,
but
that's
how
we
come
to
this
case.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
correct,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--no,
your
honor.
that
is
the
merits
determination.
and...
and
the
statute
tracks--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--that
the
preclusive
elements
are
the
merits
question
of
the
case,
not
the
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
i'm
agreeing
with
you
on
covered
security.
i'm...
i'm
saying
that
there
then
is
the
further
inquiry
of
whether
all
of
the
preclusive
elements
of
subsection
77p(b)
are
met,
which
is
the
merits
inquiry.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
there...
there
are
very
few
cases
that
don't
involve
covered
securities
because
virtually
every
security
is
covered.
there
are
very
few
cases
that
aren't
covered
class
actions
because
if
they
involve
more
than
50
people,
that's
about
all
the
requirement
there
is.
those
are
the
jurisdictional
prerequisites.
that,
if
established,
gives
the
court
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
then
we
have
the
substantive
elements
of
the
slusa
preclusion
defense
provided
in
a
different
statute
that
is
not
jurisdictional,
just
like
this
court
described
in
arbaugh.
the
covered
security
and
covered
class
action
congress
made
jurisdictional
by
putting
them
in
the
statute.
the
substantive
elements
of
the
defense
congress
did
not
make
jurisdictional
because
they're
in
another
statute.
that's
the
disconnect
that
judge
easterbrook
understood
so
that
on
the
face
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
where
it
recites
the
defendants
maintain
that
the
in
connection
with
requirement
was
met,
that
defense,
if
colorable...
and
it
clearly
was.
this
court
has
accepted
it
in
dabit...
conferred
jurisdiction
on
the
court,
and
then
the
substantive
decision
on
the
merits
was
the
merits
determination.
that
is
the
decoupling
that
congress
did
in
slusa,
that
judge
easterbrook
correctly
recognized,
and
that
puts
this
case
squarely
within
the
thermtron
exception
to
1447(d).
mr.
mark
a.
perry
in
those
cases,
your
honor,
they
work
differently
than
slusa
for
two
reasons.
one,
they're
the
whether...
not
whether
it
will
be
tried,
but
where
it
will
be
tried.
and
when
congress...
and
when
it
was
only
a
where
question,
congress
puts
in
a
specific
provision.
the
other
is
cafa,
for
example,
is
expressly
jurisdictional.
it
amends
the
diversity
statute.
so
there's
no
argument
that
it
would
be
within
thermtron.
every
cafa
question
is
a
1447(c)
issue.
congress
had
to
make
it.
here,
congress
knew
about
thermtron.
congress
has
known
about
thermtron
for
30
years.
this
court
reaffirmed
thermtron
while
they
were
debating
slusa.
and
congress
knew
that
this
question
was
not
jurisdictional.
congress
decoupled
them,
just
as
this
court
described
in
arbaugh.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
and,
justice
ginsburg,
if
judge
hermansdorfer
had
said,
i'm
much
too
busy
and
therefore
i
lack
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
thermtron
case
would
have
been
decided
any
differently.
congress
understands
the
difference
between
jurisdiction
and
merits.
this
court
understands
the
difference
between
jurisdiction
and
merits.
judge
easterbrook
certainly
understood
that
distinction.
this
determination
made
by
the
district
court
here
was
a
merits
determination
not
controlled
by
1447(c),
and
therefore,
appeal
was
not
barred
by
1447(d).
mr.
mark
a.
perry
no,
your
honor.
it
references
subsection
(b).
mr.
mark
a.
perry
just
as
title
vii
says
what
can
be
brought
is
an
action
under
this
title
or
just
as
the
environmental
statute
in
steel
company
said
what
can
be
brought
is
an
action
under
subsection
(a).
the
cross
reference
of
another
provision
containing
substantive
elements
of
federal
law
does
not
make
those
elements
jurisdictional.
that's
the
holding
of
arbaugh.
that's
the
holding
of
steel
company.
there's
no
reason
that
the
same
principle
shouldn't
be
applied
when
congress
makes
a
federal
defense
removable
as
when
it
makes
a
federal
claim
subject
to
suit
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
well,
justice
souter,
we
know
from
mesa
that
if
congress
had
just
made
all
covered
class
actions
removable,
we
would
have
to
find
some
federal
defense
to
support
article
iii
jurisdiction.
congress,
by
cross
referencing
subsection
(b),
just
pointed
the
federal
courts
to
the
particular
federal
defense
that
is
sufficient,
clearly
sufficient,
to
make
article
iii
satisfied
under
the
mesa
case.
that's
all
that
that
cross
reference
is
doing.
it's
not,
however,
picking
up
every
element.
if
congress
wanted
to
include
every
element
of
title
vii,
that
environmental
statute
of
slusa,
it
would
have
put
them
in
the
jurisdictional
provision.
arbaugh
says--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--yes,
your
honor.
we
have
not
only
the...
the
reference
there,
but
we
have
the
final
sentence
of
that
clause
where
we
say
after
removal,
after
the
court
establishes
that
it
has
removal
jurisdiction,
it
shall
subject
the
action
to
subsection
(b).
that
clause
is
entirely
redundant
under
petitioners'
reading
of
the
statute.
entirely
redundant.
i've
read
the
reply
brief
a
number
of
times.
i
don't
understand
their
explanation
for
that.
the
only
explanation
is
that
congress
made
removability
contingent
on
the
subsection
(c)
factors.
thank
you,
your
honor.
