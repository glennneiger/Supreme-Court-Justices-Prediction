justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
doesn't...
what
thermtron
says
is
that
we
read
(d)
in
conjunction
with
(c).
now,
the
reason
that
(c)
is
relevant
here
is
because
it
says,
if
at
any
time
before
final
judgment
it
appears
that
the
district
court
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
case
shall
be
remanded.
presumably
what
(c)
is
thinking
of
are
cases
where
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
not
the
whole
issue
before
the...
the
federal
court.
it's
thinking
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
certain
instances,
like
a
defect
in
a
removal
proceeding,
is
something
that
the...
that
the
federal
court
could
get
to
prior
to
a
final
judgment.
but
here,
the
final
judgment
in
the
federal
court
is
the
very
question
of
whether
this
is
preempted
or
not.
and
therefore,
i
guess
what
easterbrook
is
thinking
is
that
that
isn't
the
kind
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
dismissal
to
which
(c)
refers.
consequently,
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of
(d)'s
no
appellate
review
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it's
no
doubt
that
all
the
lower
courts
then
would
be
wrong.
but
the
reason
he
says
that
they
are
wrong
is
because
they
looked
at
the
word,
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
in
(c)
without
realizing
that
the
reference
in
(c)
is
a
reference
to
instances
where
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
not
the
whole
issue;
i.e.,
it's
something
other
than
the
final
federal
court
decision.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
be
the
argument
he's
making.
i
would
like
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you.
you
would
also
have
to
say
that
the
same
rule
applies,
one,
to
the
complete
preemption
cases
and,
two,
to
sovereign
immunity
determinations
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
act.
but
he
would
say
that
may
be
so,
but
nonetheless,
judge
easterbrook
would
say,
well,
so
be
it.
that's
what
congress
intended.
that
is
wrong
to
deprive
someone
of
a
right
to
appeal
when
it
turns
on
a
misreading
of
(c)
and
an
incorporation
of
the
misreading
into
(d).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
make
sense--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
it
make...
what's
worrying
me
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is
we
have
decided
dabit
since
this
case
was
brought.
then
i
thought,
well,
could
we
remand
this
case
in
light
of
dabit.
now,
if
we
did
that,
we
wouldn't
decide
the
issue
that
you
all
want
decided,
and
we'd
let
this,
unfortunately,
slightly
confused
situation
continue
to
exist.
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
that?
are
there...
are
there
a
lot
of
cases,
or
is
this
something
that
comes
up
often?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
think.
it
seems
if
you...
it
ought
to
work
out
similarly
to
what
happens
in
a
case
where
there's
a
federal
issue
that
you
remove
under.
now
you've
removed.
and
there
also
is
a
state
issue
pendent.
now,
what
the
judge
does
is
he
says,
defendant,
you
win
on
the
federal
issue,
and
i'm
going
to
send
this
thing
back
now,
remand
it,
because
i
don't
think
i
want
to
maintain
here
the
state
issue.
and
so
it's
a
remand
order.
the
case
is
remanded.
now,
i
think
you
get
an
appeal
on
your
federal
issue
there.
and
then...
then
why
shouldn't...
if
that's
so,
shouldn't
this
work
out
the
same
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
shouldn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
confused
now.
you're
saying
both
sides
agreed
that
section
1447(d)
does
not
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
then...
then
i
understand
that.
what
i
don't
understand
is
the
question
about
something
remaining
to
be
done.
what...
what
77p(b)
says
is
the
covered
class
action,
i
take
it,
is
any
private
party
alleging.
and
when
i
see
the
word
alleging,
i
think
you're
supposed
to
look
at
the
complaint
to
see
what
they
allege,
not
some
other
thing
about
what's
going
to
happen
later.
but
you're
telling
me
that's
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you're
right
that
that's
wrong,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
possibly
get
out
of
(c)
in
1447(c)
which
talks
about
a
decision
before
final
judgment,
that
it
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
because
if
you're
right,
then
this
is
before
final
judgment,
it
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that's
the
end
of
your
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you
have
to
disagree
with...
i
guess...
go
ahead.
disagree.
i'd
like
to
hear
the
answer.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
which
would
have
to
be
a
colorable
defense
that
there
is
an
allegation
by
the
plaintiff
that
falls
within
(b).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
if...
i
mean,
it's
awfully
surprising...
i
think
that's
why
you're
getting
this
resistance...
that
there's
an
issue
in
a
case,
does...
is
the...
the
state
action
preempted
or
not.
they've
never
had
an
appeal.
so
they
get
it
tried.
the
whole
case
is
tried
out,
and
then
the...
some
state
court
says,
in
our
opinion
it
is
preempted.
but
they
can't
decide
that.
they
can't
decide
it
because
there
was
a
federal
judge
who
said
the
opposite
in
the
same
case
before
the
case
was
final.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
don't...
and
if
they
refuse
to
decide
it,
why
wouldn't
this
court
say,
this
is
the
same
case?
there
is
only
one
case.
it
isn't
over
yet,
and
we're
reviewing
that,
and
we
think
that
district
judge
was
wrong.
we
think
that
federal
district
judge
never
read
dabit,
which
isn't
surprising
since
it
was
decided
after
he
wrote
the
opinion.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
so
odd.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose...
suppose
the...
it
came
up
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
the
district
court
judge
remands
the
case.
in
his
opinion
romania
is
not
a
country.
that's
what
he
thinks.
never
heard
of
it.
[laughter]
so...
so
it
goes
back
to
the
state
court
and
the
state
court
says,
yes,
that's
right.
we've
not
heard
of
romania
either.
it's
not
a
country.
all
right.
now,
you're
saying
there
we
are
for
all
time.
everybody
is
stuck
with
this
holding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
maybe
that's
why
i'm
so
surprised
that
such
could
be
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
the
district
court
was
wrong
too
i
guess
because
the
district
court
made
the
same--
