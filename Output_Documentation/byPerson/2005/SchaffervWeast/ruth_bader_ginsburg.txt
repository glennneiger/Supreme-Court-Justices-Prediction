mr.
hurd,
do
you
recognize...
to
narrow
what...
the
issue...
that
the
parent
objecting
to
the
school's
iep
would
at
least
have
a
burden
of
coming
forward?
in
other
words,
i...
are
you
speaking
just
of
the
ultimate
persuasion
burden?
wouldn't
the
parents
at
least
be
required
to
come
forward
with
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
state...
the
school
district's
plan
is
inadequate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you,
before
you
get
to
your
three
reasons,
to
go
back
to
your...
something
that
you
said?
i
asked
you,
are
you
dividing
the
burden
of
production
and
persuasion?
and
you
said
no,
it's
all
on
one
side
or
the
other.
but
it
seems
to
me
your
description
of
this
proceeding,
you
said
the
school
district
goes
first.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
school
district
did
come
forward.
and
is
that
the
usual
practice
in
these
administrative
hearings...
if
the
first
one
to
go
to
defend
the
plan
is
the
school
district,
not
the
parents
who
are
attacking
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said,
in
this
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
school
district
went
first.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
now,
as
a
result
of
the
fourth
circuit's
decision,
do
the
parents
always
go
first--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
not
the
school
district?
the
school
district
has
a
plan
that
it
has
put
forward.
and
it
seemed
to
me
logical,
well,
it
has
a
plan,
so
it
should
defend
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you
think
the
alj...
or
the
administrative
hearing
officer
in
this
case
told
the
state
to
go
first...
the
school
district
to
go
first
because
he
thought
that
maybe
they
had
burden
of
proof,
and
would
not
have
asked
them
to
go
first
if
he
didn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
but
you're
saying
this...
this
is
an
ad
hoc
thing.
there
is
no
general
practice
about
which
one
goes
first.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before
we...
you
go
onto
the
argument,
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
if
i
remember
the
facts
correctly,
wasn't
quite
right.
this
child
was
in
private
school
for
years,
and
the
parents
weren't
asking
anybody
to
do
anything,
because...
and
it's
only
when
the
private
school
said,
"we
have
to...
we
can
no
longer
put
up
with
your
child.
"
"your
child
has
all
these
problems.
"
--at
that
time,
the
parents
then
came
to
the
school
district
and
asked
for
an
iep.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
the
parents
didn't
think
was
acceptable
and,
in
the
interim,
placed
the
child
in
another
private
school.
but
it
was
not
a
case
that
they
put
the
child
in
a
private
school
first,
and
then
sought
reimbursement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
garre,
do
you
have
any
numbers,
overall,
how...
of
the
incidence
of
the
parents
going
to
the
administrative
hearing
first,
as
opposed
to
the
school
district?
isn't
it
overwhelming
that,
in
these
proceedings,
the
parents
are
the
one...
ones
who
initiate
the
hearing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
we
go
back
to
the...
an
answer
you
gave
before,
when
we
were
going
through
what,
in
fact,
happened,
the
suggestion
that
maybe
the
parents
were
just
trying
to
get
the
private
school
tuition
reimbursed,
the...
there
was
a
finding,
wasn't
there,
in
the
district
court,
in
the...
this
is
in
the
petitioner's
appendix,
at
46
and
47...
the
district
court
said,
"the
parents
in
no
way
prevented
the
iep
from
being
formulated
or
otherwise
failed,
in
good
faith,
to
consider
it.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
hypothetical.
isn't
it...
it
isn't
hypothetical.
states...
isn't
it
true
that
some
states
have
said
that,
in
these
hearings,
the
school
district
will
have
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
if
you...
if
you
had
a
situation,
say,
under
title
7...
and
you
pointed
out
in
your
brief
that,
in
most
benefit
cases,
most...
the
person...
whether
it's
social
security...
the
person
who
is
making
the
claim
has
the
burden
of
proof.
but
there
is
something
different
about
this
setup,
because
the
statute
does
obligate
the
school
district
to
come
up
with
a
plan.
and
so,
i
was
thinking,
if
you
have
a
title
7
case,
and
the
plaintiff
prevails
on
the
merits,
and
then
there's
a
question
of
remedy,
and
the
employer
said,
"i
propose
this...
these
changes
to
remedy
the
violation.
"
wouldn't
the
employer
in
that
case
have
the
burden
of
establishing
the
adequacy
of
the
plan
that
it
has
come
up
with
to
remedy
the
problem?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
you
made--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
determination
has
been
made--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the...
that
there
has
been
a
violation.
and
then
the
question
is,
what
remedy?
and
the
employer
proposes
a
remedy.
wouldn't
the
employer
have
the
burden
of
showing
the
adequacy
of
the
remedy
that
the
employer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
any--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--now
we
have
a
number
of
states
that
do
put
the
burden
on
the
school
district.
is
there
any
indication
that
the
cost
is
higher
in
those
states
than
in
states
that
put
the
burden
on
the
parents?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
do
you
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
have
any
information
in...
to
the
question
i
asked
earlier...
in
the
states
that
have
said,
"school
district,
you
bear
the
burden.
"
do
we
know
whether
there's
more
litigation?
do
we
know
whether
there
has
been
a
notable
increase
in
the
costs
in
those
states
that
have
placed
the
burden
on
the
school
districts?
