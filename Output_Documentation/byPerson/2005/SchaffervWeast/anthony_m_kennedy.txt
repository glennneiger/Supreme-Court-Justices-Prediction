in
all
events--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
all
events,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
still
cut
against
you.
this
is
a
statutory
scheme
where,
you
point
out,
the
parents
have
access
to
some
initial
consultation.
in
most
instances...
or
in
many
instances,
people
who
are
suing
an
institution
don't
have
that
initial
access.
here,
the
parents
get
much
more
initial
information
than
most...
than
most
petitioners
do--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--than
most...
than
most
complainants,
than
most
aggrieved
persons
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
let--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
point...
let
me
point
out
something
else.
let's
assume
a
state
of
affairs...
just
assume
that
school
districts...
many
of
them...
independently
and,
i
think,
collectively,
because
school
districts
talk
to
each
other...
have
a
growing
body
of
data
and
expertise
about
iep.
and
this
is
the
basis
on
which
you
say
that
they
should
come
forward.
it
seems
to
me
that,
too,
though,
cuts
against
you,
because
when
a
school
district
has
expertise,
i
think
it's
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
governmental
deregularity.
and
you
have
to
challenge
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
the...
to
the
extent
that
we're
concerned
about
unnecessarily
increasing
costs
on
school
districts,
and
burdens
on
school
districts,
why
shouldn't
we
have
a
uniform
federal
rule?
in
other
words,
if
we
agree
with
your
position
that
ordinary
allocations
puts
this
on
the
complainant,
we
have
to
conserve
resources,
and
so
forth,
why
should
we
allow
states
to
have
a
different
rule,
when
we're
dealing
with
the
administration
of
a
federal
program?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there
hasn't
been
finding
of
any
violation
by
the
school
district.
the
school
district--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
i...
but
i'm
interested
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
interested
in
justice
ginsburg's
question.
let's
assume
you
show
a
violation.
is
there...
is
there
any
law
on
who
has
the
burden
of--
showing
that
the
remedy
is
sufficient?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
when
i
ask--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you're
asking
about
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--about
the...
wait
a
minute.
let's
say
that
the...
we
find
that
there's
a
violation.
