well,
that's
where
i
am
not
understanding
your
argument.
there
is
an
iep
in
all
of
these
cases.
i
would
understand
your
argument
if
the
state...
the
school
district
said,
"we're
not
going
to
educate
this
kid.
"
"throw
him
into
the
pot
with
everybody
else.
"
"we
won't
give
you
an
iep.
"
that's
not
what
we've
got
here.
and,
in
fact,
if
that's
what
we
had
here,
the
burden
of
proof
issue
would
be
of
no
significance,
because
the
state...
the
parents
would
walk
in,
and
the
only
thing
they'd
have
to
do
to
satisfy
"a"
burden
of
proof
would
be
to
say,
"they
didn't
come
up
with
an
iep.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
instead,
what
we
have
here
is
a
fight
about
whether
it's
a
good
iep
or
no
iep.
justice
david
h.
souter
then--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
we're
arguing
about
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
state
is
not
saying,
"we
will
not
come
up
with
an
iep.
"
the
state
is
saying,
"this
is
what
we're
going
to
give
you.
"
and
the
parents
say,
"it's
not
good
enough".
justice
david
h.
souter
in
an...
in
an
equal
partnership
argument,
nobody's
got
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
know
what
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
know
what
the
figure
is
per
hearing?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no.
you
divide
the
number
of
hearings
by
the
figure
you've
just
mentioned,
and
that's
the
result.
have
you...
have
you
done--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
arithmetic?
justice
david
h.
souter
three--
