justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
congress
was
silent
on
this
subject
of
the
burden
of
proof,
was
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there...
did
you
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history...
i
know
some
members
don't
care
to
look
at
that,
but
i
would
be
willing--
[laughter]
--that
shows
any
discussion
at
all
about
the
burden
of
proof
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
well,
what
if
you
had
an
iep
that
the
parents
had
initially
agreed
with,
and
then
they
decide
it
isn't
working
well,
they
want
to
challenge
it.
they
shouldn't
have
a
burden
of
proof?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
mean
the
court
has...
every
court
faced
with
this
problem
is
supposed
to
decide,
in
that
particular
case,
who
hast
who
has
the
burden?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
think
it's
open
to
a
state
to
adopt
a
general
rule
on
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
under
this
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
some
states
purported
to
adopt
a
general
rule
on
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that's
invalid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
case
is
your
closest
one
to
support
the
view
that
the
court
should
adopt
some
particular
rule
here,
based
on
the
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
rely
on?
i
just
don't
know
where
we
look
for
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--guiding
principle.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
let--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--let's
talk--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--burden
of
proof
cases.
what
is
your
closest
one
where
the
courts
are
left
to
do
this?
what
do
we
look
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
a
case
where
the
parents
unilaterally
decided
to
move
the
child
to
a
private
school,
and
then
they
sought
tuition
reimbursement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
any
doubt,
here,
that
there's
no
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
burden
of
proof
in
iep
cases--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
should
have
said.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
other
words--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--your
answer
is
yes,
the
states
may
adopt
a
burden
of
proof...
here...
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--decide
that
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maryland--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--doesn't
have--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--such
a
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit.
in
1970,
congress
passed
what
today
is
called
the
individuals
with
disabilities
education
act;
the
acronym
of
that
is
idea.
that
act
is
intended
to
ensure
all
disabled
children
a
free,
appropriate
public
education.
it
requires
public
schools
to
identify
disabled
children;
it
establishes
procedures
for
schools
and
for
parents
to
work
together
to
create
an
individualized
education
program,
called
an
iep,
for
each
disabled
child.
if
the
parents
disagree
with
the
school
about
what
services
are
appropriate,
the
act
gives
the
parents
the
right
to
request
a
so-called
due-process
hearing.
the
act
specifies
various
requirements
for
these
hearings,
but
it
does
not
specify
which
party
bears
the
burden
of
persuasion
at
the
hearing.
in
this
case,
the
4th
circuit
court
of
appeals
put
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
the
parents,
concluding
that
there
was
no
sufficient
reason
to
depart
from
the
usual
rule
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
lies
with
the
party
seeking
relief.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
in
an
administrative
hearing
challenging
an
iep
is
properly
placed
upon
the
party
seeking
relief
--
in
this
case,
thatâ€™s
the
parents,
the
petitioners
--
but
where
a
school
district
initiates
a
hearing,
it
will
bear
the
burden
of
persuasion.
because
the
individuals
with
disabilities
act
is
silent
about
where
the
burden
of
persuasion
should
lie,
we
follow
the
ordinary
default
rule
that
plaintiffs
bear
the
burden
regarding
the
essential
aspects
of
their
claims.
although
this
default
rule
has
exceptions,
we
only
rarely
place
the
entire
burden
of
persuasion
at
the
outset
of
a
proceeding
upon
the
opposing
party,
as
petitioners
urge
us
to
do
in
this
case.
absent
some
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
otherwise,
we
conclude
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
lies
where
it
usually
does,
with
the
party
seeking
relief.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
and
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer
have
each
filed
dissenting
opinions.
