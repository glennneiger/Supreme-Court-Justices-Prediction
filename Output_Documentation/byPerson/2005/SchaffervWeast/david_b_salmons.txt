mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
several
features
of
the
idea
confirm
that
congress
intended
the
traditional
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
to
apply
to
the
administrative
hearings
under
the
act,
and
the
most
important
of
these--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
the--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
the
government
has
always
understood...
and
this
court
has
understood...
that
this
is
spending
clause
legislation,
and
that
the
requirements
of
the
act
establish
a
floor,
and
that
that's
true
with
regard
with
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act,
as
well
as
the
procedural
ones.
and
let
me
give
you
one
example.
i
will
concede
that
this
may
seem
somewhat
anomalous,
but
this
an
unusual
statute.
in
rowley,
for
example,
this
court
construed
the
meaning
of
the
term
"a
free,
appropriate
public
education.
"
and
it
determined...
in
fact,
it
rejected
a
construction
of
that
term
that
would
have
required
maximizing
the
educational
benefit
to
the
child.
there
are
states
that
have
adopted
that
high
substantive
requirement
for
their
schools.
and
when
someone
brings
an
action,
either
at
a
due
process
hearing
or
in
federal
or
state
court,
a
separate
civil
action
under
statute,
the
courts
apply
that
higher
state
standard.
we
think
the
same
would
be
true
with
regard
to
a
state's
decision
to
adopt
more
restrictive...
or
more
protective,
excuse
me,
procedural
provisions
for
the
parents
with
children
with
disabilities.
it
is
left
up
to
the
states.
the
federal
law--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--just
establishes
a
floor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
states
may,
and
states
have.
what
we
think
is--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--improper--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i
would
say
that
we
don't
have
any
evidence
that
is
as
strong
as
we
would
like
on
that.
what
we
do
have,
and
what
i
would
refer
the
court
to,
is
the
2003
gao
report
on
the
way
in
which
the...
these
provisions
have
been
implemented.
that
is...
it's
cited
on
both
respondent's
and
petitioner's
brief,
and
it
was
relied
on
by
congress
in
the
2004
amendments.
and
what
it...
what
it
demonstrates
is
that
80
percent...
nearly
80
percent
of
all
due
process
hearings
nationwide
have
occurred
in
just
six
jurisdictions,
five
states
and
the
district
of
columbia,
and
that...
and
that,
in
those
states...
it
happens
to
be
the
case
at
all,
but
maryland,
which
is
one
of
those
states...
have
clear
rules
that
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
school
districts,
and
that
the
costs--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
it
may
very
well
be
that
you
would
want
something
more
than
just
a
court
decision.
and
i--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--and
the
states
that
have
done
it--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
i
don't
think--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
maryland--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--maryland
does
not.
and
i
think,
in
fact,
the
only
thing...
the
only
question
that's
truly
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
statute
mandates
the
unusual
burden...
shift
of
placing
the
burden
on
the
schools
in
all
cases.
and
we
think
that
clearly
wasn't
what
congress
intended.
and
let
me
point
to
the
provision
of
the
statute
we
think
is
the
most
relevant,
and
that
is
the
requirement
that
the
parents...
or
the
complaining
party
file
a
complaint
to
initiate
the
due
process
hearing.
and
that
traditional
pleading
regime
requires
that
the...
in
this
context,
the
parents
come
forward
and
identify,
with
specificity
and
with
supporting
facts,
the
problem
with
the
school's
educational
program
and
how
they
would
propose
to
solve
that
problem.
and,
in
2004,
congress
went
even
further
and
mandated
that
parents
cannot
even
obtain
a
due
process
hearing
until
they've
first
complied
with
this
due
process
notice
requirement,
and
that
the
contents
of
the
parents'
complaint
will
strictly
define
the
subjects
that
can
be
addressed
at
the
hearing.
and
we
think
that
is
strong
evidence
that
congress
intended
the
traditional
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
your
honor,
i
did
not.
what
i
indicated
is
that
one
of
the
unusual
aspects
of
these
due
process
hearings
is
that
they
occur
very
infrequently,
only
about
5
for
every
10,000
children
receiving
educational
benefits
under
the
act
nationwide.
in
certain
jurisdictions,
there
is
a
very
high
incidence
of
these
hearings.
and
congress,
in
2004,
was
clearly
concerned
about
the
costs
that
those
hearing
were
imposing,
and
were
diverting
funds
away
from
the
real
purposes
of
the
act.
now,
getting
back
to
the
statute,
we
think--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
i
was
saying
is
that
i
can't
tell
you
that
more
states
than
not
have
adopted
one
rule--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--or
the
other.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
but
most--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--of
the
due
process
hearings
that
occur
in--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--in
the
country--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--occur
in
jurisdictions--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--where,
either
by
court
or
by
rule--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i
don't
have
that
information.
most,
i
think,
of
the
jurisdictions
were...
most
of
the
jurisdictions
have
the
burden
on
the
schools,
because
that's
what
the
courts...
the
federal
courts
have
construed
the
federal
statute
to
require.
what...
the
reason
i
have
a
difficult
time
answering
that
is
because
the
amount
of
due
process
hearings
varies
so
widely
from
one
jurisdiction
to
another.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and
part
of
that
is
because
of
the
rules
and
the
ways
in
which
it's
been
adopted.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
no...
your
honor,
there
are
several
states
that
have
clearly
placed
the
rule...
by
rule,
on
the...
on
the...
on
the
person
initiating--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the
hearing.
and,
in
fact,
i
would
say
most
states
probably
have
a
sort
of
state
apa--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--very
similar
to
the
federal
apa.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--it--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--there
may
be
a
cause
and
effect
issue
there,
your
honor.
it
may
be
the
case
that
the
types...
that
by
encouraging
the
type
of
litigation
under
the
act
by
switching
the
burden
of
proof
has
resulted
in
more
cases
being
brought.
the
interesting
fact--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--from
the
2004
amendments
is
that
congress
sought
to
reduce
the
amount
of
litigation
under
the
act
by,
for
example,
allowing--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--for
the
first
time--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i...
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
the...
i
can't
answer
that.
i
think
it's...
it's
most...
it's
more
recent
than
that.
and
i
think
the
explosion
of
litigation
under
the
act
is
more
recent
than
that.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and
congress
has
been
very
concerned
about
that.
now,
by
requiring
that
the
parent's
due
process
complaint
define
the
contours
of
the
hearing,
we
think
congress
has
signaled
where
the
burden
of
proof
should
be.
and,
in
addition
to
that,
it
seems...
it
seems
to
us
that
it
has
addressed
the
policy
and
fairness
concerns
the
petitioners
rely
on
so
much.
as
this
court
recognized
in
rowley,
it's
through
the
procedural
protections
of
the
act
that
congress
sought
to
ensure
that
parents
had
sufficient
information
and
resources
to
defend
the
interests
of
their
child.
and
we
think,
by
place...
this
complaint
notice
requirement
represents
a
considered
judgment
by
congress
that
those
procedural
protections
will
have
done
their
jobs
and
that
parents
will
be
in
a
strong
enough
position
to
adequately
defend
the
interests
of
their
child
in
any
hearing.
and
that's
certainly
true
if
you
would
compare
the
position
of
the
parents
under
this
act
with
benefits
claimants
and
civil
rights
plaintiffs
in
any
number
of
other
federal
statutes.
if
your
honors
have
no
more
questions,
thank
you.
