justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
why
didn't
it?
i...
why
wasn't
the
apa
applicable?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
it
if
were...
what
it
were
a
school
on
a
federal
base?
are
they
covered
by
this
act,
by
the
way?
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--military
schools
on
military--
justice
antonin
scalia
--dod
schools.
what
do
you
do
with
them?
are
they
governed
by
the
apa?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you'd
be
suing
some
federal
agency.
i
mean,
it
has
to
be
some
federal
agency
that's
running
that
school,
and
at
least
for
that
kind
of
a
school
the
burden
is
clearly
going
to
be
on
the
person
challenging
the
agency
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
the
purposes
of
the
statute
argument.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
always
to
provide
relief
to
someone
who's
been
injured.
and
to
conclude,
from
this,
that,
therefore,
the
burden
should
be
on
the
other
side,
in
order...
in
order
that
people
who
are
injured
can
get
relief,
is...
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
will
always
be
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
i...
that's
one
sort
of
relief.
but,
i
mean,
you
have
some
relief
at
issue
under
every
statute.
they
want
a
needy
person
to
be
given
justice.
and
to
say
that,
since
that's
their
purpose,
you
should
always
put
the
burden
on
the
other
side,
is...
i
just
don't
understand
that
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
for
all
i
know,
says,
in
its
prologue...
or,
if
it
doesn't,
it
should
have,
or
it
could
have...
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
assure
that
every
person
who's
been
injured
by
a...
by
a
government
tort
obtains
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
sense
does
it
make
for
the
parents
to
tell
that
to
the
school
system?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it's
only
play
money,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hurd,
here's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--here's
my
problem
with
your
assertion
that
we
have
to
decide
it
in
the
way
that
furthers
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
we
said,
in
other
cases...
and
correctly,
i
think...
that
no
statute
pursues
its
purpose
at
all
costs,
that
there
are
limitations
upon
its
purpose.
it,
of
course,
wants
students
who
need
this
special
help
to
get
it,
but
it
also
does
not
want
students
who
don't
need
this
special
help
to
get
it.
and
for
you
to
say,
"there's
no
harm
done".
you
know,
"if
he...
if
he's
given
it
when
he
doesn't
need
it.
"
"what's
the
problem?
"
"he
goes
to
a
better
school.
"
the
problem
is
that
this
is
not
play
money.
it's
coming
from
somewhere;
and,
namely,
on
the
citizens
who
have
to
pay
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
garre,
you...
or,
mr.
garre,
you
said,
in
your
earlier
statement,
that
sometimes
the
school
district
will
be
the
complaining
party.
how
does
that...
how
does
that
come
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
would
the
school
district
have
to
take
any
action?
why
wouldn't
it
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
say,
"the
child
can't
come
to
class.
"
"he's
too
disruptive.
"
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
cases
are
appealed
to
federal
courts
normally,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
federal
courts.
and
most
of
these
cases
are
in
federal
courts.
and
you're...
you
want
to
condemn
federal
courts
to
figuring
out
what
the
state
burden
of
proof
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
would
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
have
a
statute
that...
you
know,
it's
in...
it's
in
great
detail...
on
administrative
procedures.
it
obviously...
you
know,
decision
of
hearing
officer,
administrative
procedures,
disclosure,
evaluations,
and
recommendations.
and
you
think
the
federal
government
goes
into
all
this
detail
and
doesn't
care
who
has
the
burden
of
proof?
that
seems,
to
me,
most
unlikely.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there's
no
violation
here.
i
mean,
this
is
a
totally
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
--situation.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
say
this
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
you
say
all
these
horrible
consequences
are
perfectly
okay,
so
long
as
the
states
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
the
consequences
are
that
horrible,
how
can
you
allow
the
states
to
put
the
burden
on
the
other
side?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your...
your
parade
of
harm
just
never--
justice
antonin
scalia
--never
gets
started,
once
you...
once
you
acknowledge
that
the
states
can
blow
the
whistle
to
start
the
parade.
justice
antonin
scalia
absent
different
disposition
by
the
states?
what's
the
government's
position?
can
the
states
change
this
burden,
just
the
background,
you
know...
unless
you...
unless
you
think
it's
okay
to,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
the
heavens
fall...
we
don't
want
the
heavens
to
fall.
justice
antonin
scalia
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--these
other
cases
that
you
refer
to,
where...
that
involve
spending
legislation,
where
the
states
go
beyond
what
is
minimally
required...
i
suspect
that
they
are
cases
where
it
really
is
an
imposition
on
the
states,
and
they
accept
it.
here,
the
imposition
is
not
on
the
states,
it's
on
the
local
school
districts.
and
very
often,
the
interests
of
a
local
school
district
is
quite
different
from
the
interests
of
the
people,
you
know,
down
state,
in
the
state
capital.
i'm...
i
am
loath
to
think
that
just
because
a
state
supreme
court
says
that
every
school
district
in
the
state
has
to
bear
the
burden
of
proof,
that
congress
intended
that
to
be
the
case.
i
think
it's
a
different...
a
different
situation,
where
the
spending
is
money
that's
coming
out
of
the...
ultimately,
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
school
district.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
each
hearing
or...
for
each
hearing
or
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
would
be
more
realistic
to
divide
it
by
the
number
of
hearings,
rather
than
by
the
number
of
heads.
