mr.
william
h.
hurd
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
as
congress
recently
reaffirmed,
the
idea
was
enacted
to
protect
the
rights
of
children
with
disabilities,
and
the
rights
of
their
parents.
it
is
an
act
intended
by
congress
to
remedy
a
long
history
of
discrimination
that
once
kept
these
children
from
the
schoolhouse
door.
it
is
an
act
intended,
as
this
court
said
in
rowley,
to
maximize
parental
involvement
and
to
ensure
that
these
children
have
access
to
an
appropriate
education.
today,
the
intent
of
congress,
as
shown
by
the
text,
structure,
and
purposes
of
the
act,
calls
for
the
burden
of
proof
in
administrative
hearings
to
be
placed
on
the
school
system,
not
on
the
parent.
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
placing
the
burden
on
the
party
who
initiates
proceeding
is
the
traditional
rule.
but,
there
is
no
single
traditional
rule.
instead,
there
is
a
collection
of
different
rules.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
yes,
it
was,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
we
are
aware
of
none,
your
honor.
what
we...
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
congress,
when
it
wishes
to
allocate
the
burden
of
proof
one
way
or
the
other
legislatively,
knows
how
to
do
so.
it
did
so
in
the
apa,
for
example,
while
adopting
the
rule
that
the
fourth
circuit
said
applies
in
this
case.
but
congress
did
not
adopt
the
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well,
your
honor,
the
apa
governs
federal
agencies,
it
doesn't--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--govern
proceedings--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--under
the--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--under
the
idea.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
there
are--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--dod
schools--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
they
are
not.
and
part
of
the
reason
for
that
has
to
do
with
this
unique
structure
of
the
act.
it
is
a
very
nontraditional
statute.
it
is--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--i
don't
agree,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
why,
because
of
the
unique
structure
of
this
act,
it
creates
an
equal
partnership
between
parents
and
the
school
system,
with
the
purpose
of
that
partnership
being
to
produce
an
individualized
education
program
for
the
benefit
of
the
child.
and,
as
this
court
recognized
in
honig,
that
iep
is
the
centerpiece
of
the
entire
statute.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
different
situation,
and
courts
below
have
reached
different
results
on
that.
we
believe
that
the
school
system--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--no,
your
honor.
some
courts
have
decided
that,
where
either
party...
the
school
system
or
the
parents...
challenges
an
existing
iep
or
wants
to
change
an
existing
iep,
some
courts
have
said
the
burden
is
always
on
the
school
system,
some
have
said
the
party
challenging
has
the
burden.
but--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--in
this
case--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
we
think
that
it
is
not.
we
believe
it
is
a
federal
question
that--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--some
have,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well,
we
believe...
yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
is
a...
it
is
a
federal
law
question.
what
we
do
know,
however,
is
that
maryland
has
adopted
no
rule
on
this
question,
no
statute
to
allocate
the
burden,
one
way
or
the
other.
and
even
if
a
state
has
the
ability
to
adopt
a
rule,
if
it
wishes
to
do
so,
that
still
leaves
open
the
question
of
what
rules
should
apply
in
the
absence
of
a
state
based
rule.
now--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
it's
necessary.
we
do
recognize
that
is
a
different
question.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
school
system
was
required
to
go
first,
but,
initially,
the
parents
were
given
the
burden
of
proof.
it
is
a...
it
is
a
different
question.
and
let
me
address,
if
i
may,
the
different
paradigm
that
this
kind
of
action
presents,
because
it's
very
different
than
a
traditional
statute.
it
goes
back
to
this
unique
equal
partnership.
congress
intends
for
that
child
to
have
an
iep.
and
there
are
only
two
ways
to
get
that
iep.
one
is
a
consensus
between
parent
and
school
system.
but
if
there
is
an
impasse,
congress
still
wants
that
child
to
have
an
iep,
and
there's
only
one
way
to
carry
out
that
congressional
purpose;
somebody
has
to
step
forward
and
ask
for
the
hearing
officer
to
make
a
decision.
and
it
makes
little
sense
to
burden
a
party
just
because
that
party
is
the
one
who
stepped
forward
to
advance
the
congressional
goal
by
asking
for
the
ie...
hearing
officer
first.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
i
would--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--i
would...
justice
o'connor,
i
would
point,
for
example,
to
your
opinion
in
gebser
vs.
lago
vista,
where
you
said
that
the
general
rule...
this
was
not
a
burden
of
proof
case,
but,
in
any
event,
you
said
the
general
rule
must
yield
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--in
order
to
figure
out--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--congressional
intent.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well,
your
honor,
the
court,
last
year,
in
alaska
versus
epa,
said,
there
is
no
single
rule,
or
principle,
governing
the
allocation
of
the
burden.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
also
said
two
other
things
that
are
important
here.
one
is,
it
put
the
burden
on
the
government
in
that
case,
regardless
of
whether
the
government
was
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant.
so,
the
idea
of
burdening
the
party
who
initiates
the
proceedings
was
projected
there,
and
this
court
said
it
looked
at
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
saw
no
reason
to
place
the
burden
differently,
depending
upon
whether
the
government
came
to
court
as
the
plaintiff
or
took
unilateral
action
forcing
the
other
side
to
come
to
court
where
the
government
would
be
the
defendant.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--justice
scalia,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
obtain
for
the
child
an
individualized
education
program.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well,
your
honor,
this
is
a
unique
statutory
scheme.
the
purposes
of
the
act
are
set
forth
in
the
law
very
clearly...
page
6
and
7
of
the
addendum
to
the
blue
brief...
one
is
to
ensure
that
all
children
with
disabilities
have
available
to
them
a
free,
appropriate
public
education.
and--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--that
purpose
is
served
far
more,
justice
scalia--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--but
let
me,
then,
point
out
the
very
different
paradigm
between
the
ordinary
tort
claim
statute
and
this
statute.
in
your
ordinary
tort
claim
statute,
your
ordinary
litigation,
the
law
starts
out
by
being
neutral
with
respect
to
the
status
quo.
and
that's
the
reason
why
you
have
this
rule...
we
don't
think
it
is
called
"traditional
rule"
appropriately...
but
the
general
rule
that
you
place
the
burden
on
the
party
who
initiates
litigation
is
because
the
law
is
neutral
with
respect
to
the
status
quo
at
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit.
here,
the
law
is
not
neutral,
because
the
status
quo
before
the
hearing
is
the
child
has
no
individualized
education
program.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
justice
scalia--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--justice
scalia,
with
all
due
respect,
there
is
no
iep;
there's
only
a
proposed
iep.
and
that
is--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--the
crucial
difference--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--the
point,
though,
is
that
with--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
that
is
not
an
iep;
that
is
a
proposed
iep.
and
it
is
not
merely
arguing
about
words;
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
statute.
let
me
explain
why.
three
things
this
court
has
said...
or
the
regulations
say.
number
one,
the
regulations
say
that
the
parents
and
the
school
system
are
equal
partners.
this
court
said,
in
the
honig
case,
that
congress
very
much
intended
to
strip
school
systems
of
the
power
to
act
unilaterally
with
respect
to
these
children.
thirdly,
this
court
said,
in
rowley,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
maximize
parental
involvement.
now,
if
we're
equal
partners
at
the
table,
what
sense
does
it
make
for
the
school
system
to
tell
the
parents
that,
"we
are
equal
partners
here,
but,
if
you
disagree
with
me
once
we
leave
the
table,
i
am
presumed
correct?
"
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
in
an
equal
partnership
argument,
nobody
has
the
burden,
because
they
initiated
the
proceeding
to
ask
for
the
goal
that
congress
had
in
mind--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--that
the
child
have
an
iep.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
they--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--well,
your
honor,
actually
their
discovery
rights
are
less
than
what
they
would
normally
have.
but
let
me
go
to
the
idea,
then,
that
we
are--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--equal
partners--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
we
disagree
with
that,
because
of
the
structure
of
the
act.
again,
it
makes
no
sense
to
be
equal
partners
at
the
table,
and,
once
you
reach
an
impasse,
to
say,
well,
you're
going
to
presume
one
side
is
right.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
there
is
no
analogous
case,
because--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--because--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--because
there
is
no
analogous
statute.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
there's
no
analogous
statute.
there
is
no
other
statute
we've
been
able
to
find
where
private
citizens
are
made
equal
partners
with
government
in
the
design
and
approval
of
government
actions.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
i
don't...
i
don't
know
how
many
times
the
hearing
officer
has
said
that.
i
do
think
the
burden
of
proof
is
not...
is
not...
or
the
evidence
is
not
balanced
on
a
razor's
edge.
i
think
it
is
a...
is
a
broader
table
than
that.
but
let
me
explain,
if
i
may,
three
reasons.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
in
this--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
typical
procedure
would
be
that
the...
whichever
party
has
the
burden
of
proof
would
go
first.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
it--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--yes,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
the
hearing
officer
had
not
yet
resolved
the
burden
of
proof
issue
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing,
and--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--oh--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
the
typical
rule
is,
obviously,
that
whichever
party
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
proceeding
would
go
first,
but--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
there
was
a...
it's
unclear
why
he
had
them
go
first.
there
was
some
state
regulation...
then
in
effect,
no
longer
in
effect...
that
suggested
that
perhaps
the
state
had
some
initial
burden
in
that
case.
we're
not
necessarily
asking
that
the...
that
the...
that
the
state
be
required
to
go
first.
what
we
are
asking
is
that
the
state...
excuse
me,
not
the
state...
the
local
school
system
bear
the
burden
of
persuasion.
and
there
are
three--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
the
general
practice
would
be
that
whoever
has
the
burden
of
proof,
the
burden
of
persuasion,
would
also
be
the
one
to
go
first
and
go
last.
that's
the
general
practice
in
procedures.
and
we
believe
it
also
applies
here.
but
we're
not...
what
i'm...
my
point
is
that
we
are
not
wedded...
this
court
was
to
decide
that
the
parents
should
go
first,
but
the
school
system
had
the
burden
of
persuasion,
that
would
be
fine
with
us.
in
the
cases
where
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
going
to
be
determinative,
both
sides
are
going
to
have
substantial
evidence
before
the
hearing
officer.
the
question
we
think
is
most
important
here,
if
i
may,
is,
which
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
best
advances
the
purposes
of
congress?
there
are
three
reasons,
at
least,
why
we
believe
putting
the
burden
on
the
school
system
best
advances
the
purposes
of
the
congress.
number
one
has
to
do
with
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
decision.
this
court,
for
example,
in
santosky,
said
what
will
happen
if
there
is
an
erroneous
decision?
it
asked
that
question
in
the
context
of
the
standard
of
proof.
it
is
important
to
ask
that
same
question
here.
if
the
hearing
officer
makes
a
mistake
and
awards
the
child
services
that
are
not
really
needed,
then
the
child
will
receive
a
somewhat
better
education
than
the
law
requires,
and
the
school--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--well,
not
in
that
case,
where
the...
my
hypothetical
was,
where
the
hearing
officer
has
awarded
services--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
because
of--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--the
wheels
of
justice
grind
slowly...
sometimes
they
do,
but
they...
the
key
point
here
is,
look
at
what
happens
if
the
hearing
officer
denies
services
the
child
needs.
the
child
is
going
to
be
harmed,
and,
in
the
long
run,
society
is
going
to
be
harmed,
as
this
court
recognized
in
rowley.
the
harm
to
the
child
if
the
burden
is
erroneously...
excuse
me...
the
harm--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--to
the
child--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
in
most
cases--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--it
would
be
true.
these
parents
were
fortunate...
this
child
was
fortunate,
that
they
were
able
to
pay
for
brian's
services
until
montgomery
county
finally
changed
its
mind
and
gave
him
the
kind
of
services
he
had
sought
from
the
beginning,
services
they
gave
him
once
they
were
given
the
burden
of
proof.
but
most
parents
are
not
going
to
be
in
that
situation.
most
parents
of
children
with
disabilities
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
go
out
and
obtain
the
services
they
need
if
the
hearing
officer
does
not
award--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
my
purpose
is
not
to
minimize
the
monetary
interests
involved,
but
it
is
to
focus
the
court's
attention
on
the
aspect
of
it
that
congress
had
focused
on.
certainly,
if
we
have
an
erroneous
decision
either
way,
there
will
be
some
loss.
if
the
loss
is
on
the
school
system,
it
will
not
be
unimportant;
it
will
be
some
money.
if
the
loss
is
on
the
child,
it
will
be
in
the
squandering
of
human
potential--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--well,
your
honor,
those
cases
would
not
arise
under
the
idea--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
your
hypothetical
did
not
change
the
child's
placement.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
the
initial
matters
you
discussed...
sent
to
the
back
of
the
room...
the
idea
is
not
implicated
there.
if
the
school
system
tries
to
change
the
child's
placement,
then
this
court
has
already
said
that
the
school
system
bears--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
we
believe
the
strongest
possible
case
is,
initially,
where
there
is
no
iep,
where
this
is
equal
partnership,
and
the
school
system
should
be
required
to
come
forward
and
demonstrate
this
program
is
appropriate.
if,
however,
you
have
a...
an
agreed
iep
and
the
parents
say,
"well,
now
we
want
to
change
that.
"
then
the
case
for
the
parents
is,
frankly,
not
so
strong.
it
is
a
different
case.
and
some
courts
have
said,
in
those
cases,
the
parents
have
the
burden,
as
the
district
court
did,
actually,
in
this
case,
by
way
of
dictum.
other
courts
have
said,
no,
the
school
system
always
have
the...
has
the
burden.
the
court
need
not
go
so
far
here
as
the
new
jersey
court
went
in
lascari,
and
say
the
school
system
always
has
the
burden
in
order
to
the
rule...
rule
for
the
parents
in
this
case
and
say
that,
initially,
when
there
is
no
iep,
only
a
proposed
iep...
and,
justice
souter,
burlington
used
that
word
three
times,
iep
proposal>
["],
which
we
think
implies
that
it
was
not
a
real
iep...
this...
the
court
need
not
decide
the
other
issue
in
order
to
decide
that
when
there
is
no
iep,
only
a
proposal,
and
when
you
have
equal
parties
before
the
hearing
officer,
that
it
makes
no
sense
to
allocate
the
burden
on
which
one
filed
for
the
hearing
officer
first,
who
asked
for
the
tiebreaker
first.
that
really
makes
no
sense.
you
have
to,
instead,
we
submit,
decide
the
case
based
on
which
allocation
of
the
burden
in
this
situation
is
most
in
accord
with
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
two
purposes,
if
i
may.
protecting
the
rights
of
children
with
disabilities,
and
the
rights
of
their
parents,
is
what
the
statute
says.
protect
them
from
whom?
what
did
congress
have
in
mind?
obviously,
to
protect
them,
quite
frankly,
from
the
school
systems,
who
had
this
history
of
discrimination,
who
are
more
powerful,
if
you
will,
in
terms
of
both
information
and
resources,
and
who
have
a
financial
incentive,
as
the
deal
court
recognized,
to
minimize
the
needs
of
the
child.
protecting
the
side
that
congress
meant
to
protect
means
putting
the
burden
on
the
other
side
the
school
system.
secondly,
more
fundamentally,
the
purpose
is
to
ensure
the
children
have
an
appropriate
education.
the
law
doesn't
say
"promote".
it
doesn't
say
"presume".
it
doesn't
say
"risk".
it
says
"ensure".
in
baseball,
there's
an
old
umpires
rule
that
the
tie
goes
to
the
runner.
in
order
to
carry
out
purposes
of
this
statute,
when
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise,
the
tie
should
go
to
the
child.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
thank
you,
your
honor.
let
me
begin
by
focusing
on
the
costs
of
placing
the
burden
on
the
school
system.
five
years
ago,
the
united
states
said,
when
it
was
then,
in
this
case,
on
the
side
of
the
parents,
that
placing
the
burden
on
the
school
district,
quote,
"should
not
substantially
increase
the
workload
for
the
school.
"
end
quote,
page
12
of
its
brief
in
2000.
the
national
school
board
association
figures
show
that
the
total
costs
of
mediation,
due
process
hearings
and
litigation
works
out
to
about
$22
per
head
for
every
child
in
special
education.
that's
not
a
lot
of
money
to
devote
to
the
enforcement--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--total,
your
honor.
the
total
figure,
nationwide,
is
146.5
million.
if
you
divide
that
number
by
the
6.7
children
in
special
ed--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--it's
about--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--$22
a
head.
and
that--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--well,
your
honor,
the
total...
the
total
figure
is
146.5
million.
it
is
a
drop
in
the
bucket
compared
to
the
11.4
billion
that
congress
appropriates.
moreover,
your
honor--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--there's
no
indication--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--per
hearing--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
is
going
to
vary.
but
there's
no
indication--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--there
are
about
3,000--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--there
are
about
3,000--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--hearings,
but
that
$146
million
is
not
just
the
hearings;
it
also
includes
mediation,
it
includes
litigation.
and
there's
no
basis
to
conclude
that
putting
the
burden
on
the
parents
is
going
to
decrease,
rather
than
increase,
hearings.
if
you
let
the
school
systems
slide
by
without
being
held
accountable,
they
are
likely
to
be
less
thorough
in
preparing
their
ieps,
as
they
were
in
this
case.
and
when
they're
less
thorough,
there
will
be
more
understatement,
more
disputes,
and
less
consensus.
may
i
also
point
out,
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
point,
if
there
is
to
be
no
federal
law...
this
question,
if
it
is
purely
state
law...
then
it
ought
to
be
remanded
back
to
the
maryland
district
court
to
ascertain
what
maryland
law
is
on
this
point.
and,
justice
o'connor,
while
there
is
no
statute
or
regulation
on
point,
there
are
certainly
background
principles
of
law
that
maryland
has,
just
as
we've
been
arguing
here
at
the
federal
level,
that
would
dictate
for
maryland
where
that
burden
of
proof
should
lie.
now,
opposing
counsel,
the
government,
has
pointed
out
that
there
are
these
pleading
requirements.
but
these
are
not
traditional
pleading
requirements,
where
one
side
makes
allegations
and
the
other
side
goes,
"admit,
admit,
deny,
deny.
"
if
you
look
on
page
12
of
the
addendum,
you
see
the
portion
of
the
statute
that
requires
the
kind
of
response
the
government
must
make.
it's
not
admit/deny.
it
is
to
give,
essentially,
a
detailed
explanation
for
its
position,
just
as
the
parents
have
given
a
detailed
explanation
for
their
position.
and,
between
those
two
positions,
you
can
tell
who
should
have
the
burden
of
proof.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
the
court.
