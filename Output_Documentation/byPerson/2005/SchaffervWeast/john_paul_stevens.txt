paul

we
will
now
hear
argument
in
schaffer
against
weast.
mr.
hurd,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
question,
who's
going
to
pay
for
it?
because
this...
doesn't
the
parent
often
go
ahead
and
get
the
other...
the
better
program,
and
then
they
ask
for
reimbursement
for
the...
from
the
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
many
of
these
fights
occur
after
much
of
the
education
has
already
taken
place--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
they're
fighting
about
who
pays
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
not
true
if
the
parents
can
afford
to
pay
for
it,
and
have,
in
fact,
paid
for
it.
then
the
child
is
the
neutral
factor
in
it.
of
course,
in
some
cases,
what
you
say
would
be
true,
but
not
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
in
all
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
true.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garre.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
contend
the
rule
would
be
different
if
we
were...
if
it
was
all
prospective,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--ask
this
question?
you've
described
three
situations
in
which
you
have
the
burden
of
at
least
proceeding,
and
i
guess
persuasion,
too...
and,
of
course,
there's
a
difference
between
the
two.
and
i
was
just
trying
to
think,
if
i
were
a
hearing
officer,
and
i
thought,
well,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
parents'
objections
to
the
iep
are
valid,
i
think
the
first
thing
i'd
want
to
know
is,
what
is
the
iep,
and
who's
the
best
person
to
tell
me
about
it?
and
wouldn't
the
county
be
in
the
best
position
to
explain
what
has
been
done
and,
sort
of,
get
the...
get
the
hearing
started,
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
at
the
hearing,
who...
who
introduces
the
first
exhibit
or
the
first
witness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this?
are
there
any
jurisdictions
in
which
the
burden
of
proceeding
is
different
from
the
burden
of
persuasion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
analytically,
it's
a
different
issue.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
the
normal
rule
would
be
whoever
goes
first
has
the
burden
of
the
persuasion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
background--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
the
act
is,
congress
was
very
dissatisfied
with
most
of
the
judgments
being
made
by
local
officials--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
this
whole
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
salmons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
may
i
be
sure
i
didn't
misunderstand
something
you
said
earlier?
did
you
say
that
in
most
jurisdictions
the...
by
local
option,
the
states
have
elected
to
adopt
your
adversary's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
my
question.
did
you
not
tell
us
that
in
the
states
where
there...
the
largest
volume
of
these
hearings...
in
most
of
those
states
the
burden
is
on
the
school
board?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
the
number
of
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
number
of
hearings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
this
was...
i
wanted
to
point...
was
that
mostly...
in
those
jurisdictions,
was
it
by
court
or
by
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
this
is
really
a
unique
statute
in
so
many
ways.
we've
learned,
over
the
years,
that
discrimination
is
being
treated
like
everybody
else
in
this...
in
this
statute,
unusual
discrimination.
and
i'm
just
wondering,
it's...
i
find
it
surprising
and
significant
that
those
who
have
been
free
to
pick
the
right
rule
have
picked
the
rule
your
opponent--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
states
that
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
states
where
most
of
the
hearings
have
taken
place
and
have
taken
the
opposite
view,
has--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
been
true
for
a
number--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see
what
you
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
states--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--apparently
that's...
this
has
been...
this
is
not
really
a
brand
new
statute.
we're
going
back
to
the
'70s--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
this
statute.
and
is
it
true
that
for
most
of
that
period
that's
been
the
rule,
where
most
of
litigation
has
taken--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hurd,
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
