that's
a
well
established
principle
of
administrative
law.
i've
never
seen
a
case
in
administrative
law
where
a
party...
a
private
party
coming
in
and
challenging
a
government's
action
doesn't
bear
the
burden
of
proof.
and
alaska
isn't
contrary
to
that.
alaska,
they
were
citing
hornbook
law,
whether...
what
happens
with
the...
if
epa
normally
does
have
a
burden
of
proof
when
it
challenges
a
state
action,
and
that
doesn't
change,
whether
they
bring
it
in
a
state
proceeding
or
whether
it's
in
a
federal
proceeding.
i
didn't
think
it
was
quite
on
point.
but
maybe
you
know
that
i'm
wrong
on
this.
and
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
a...
can
you
think
of
any
instance,
in
all
of
administrative
law,
where
you
didn't
start
out
with
the
idea
that
a
person
challenging
a...
an
agency
action
that's
been
taken,
and
so
forth,
doesn't
have
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
do
think
that,
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
isn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
does
this
every
come
up?
i
mean,
the
other
thing
i
wondered
about
this...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
hearing
examiner
and
a
district
judge
who
have
actually
said
what
is
only
a
law
professor's
dream.
they
say,
"oh,
the
evidence
is
precisely
and
equally
in
balance.
"
i
didn't
know
that
happened
in
the
real
world.
i--
[laughter]
--i
thought
that
their...
that
judges
normally
did
their
job,
which
is,
you
look
at
complicated
evidence,
and
you
say,
"this
side
is
a
little
bit
better,
or
that
side
is
a
little
bit
better.
"
has
this
come
up
in...
a
lot,
where
they
say,
in
this
area,
"oh,
it's
exactly"--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--"#
in
equipoise"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
that's
true.
that's...
i
understand.
i
sympathize
with
that
point.
i'm
worried,
however,
about
the
fact
that
this
statute
doesn't
just
cover
the
initial
iep.
it
covers
a
whole
range
of
things,
including,
for
example,
you
have
a
hyperactive
child.
the
hyperactive
child
behaves
badly
in
class.
the
hyperactive
child
receives
discipline
related,
say,
to
how
it's
placed.
well,
the
parents
might...
properly,
perhaps...
think
that
was
very
unfair
and
wrong,
and
they
might
challenge
that
disciplinary
mark.
there
can
be
thousands
of
different
kinds
of
issues
that
come
up.
and,
in
all
of
these
issues,
is
it
supposed
to
be
the
burden
of
the
school
board,
for
example,
to
show
that
the
teacher
who
had
the
child
sit
in
the
back
of
the
class
or
received
a
bad
discipline
mark
or
something?
does
the...
does
the
school
board
have
to
prove
that
the
teacher
was
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wouldn't
it,
if
it
were
related
to
the
placement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
say
that
there
are
a
number
of...
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
a
lot
of
interim
decisions
that
come
up
that
are
affecting
how
the
child
is
placed...
whether
in
class,
whether
in
that
class,
whether
with
a
special
teacher,
whether
without
a
special
teacher,
whether
with
somebody
during
the
recess
periods,
whether
not.
i
mean,
they're...
these
are
very
complicated
matters,
and
there
can
be
important
overall
matters,
and
there
can
be
what
i'd
call
interstitial
matters.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
driving
at
is...
and
i
think
it
was
well
expressed
in
one
of
these
cases,
a
new
jersey
case,
perhaps...
but
is
it
the
same
burden
of
proof
whether
the
matter
is
interstitial
or
whether
it's
an
initial
placement
or
a
change
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--placement?
do
we
have
the
same
burden
of
proof
always
on
the
school
board,
no
matter
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
i
take...
if
i
accept
your
view
of
that,
that
would
be
a
federal
rule
written
into
the
statute.
and
that
would
mean
that,
even
if
the
department
of
education
came
to
a
different
conclusion,
or
even
if
we
have
a
bunch
of
states
that
come
to
a
different
conclusion,
or
even
if
it's
in
minnesota,
they
want
to
have
a
rule
that
"sometimes
it's
one
way,
sometimes
the
other
way.
"
we
couldn't
do
that.
but
if
i
were
a
member
of
congress,
and
never
thought
about
the
issue,
which
i
think
this
void
in
the
statute
suggests,
i
might
think
it
would
work
out
better
if
we
left
it
up
to
each
state
to
do
it
whatever
way
they
wanted
here,
if
we
left
it
up
to
the
department
of
education
to
promulgate
whatever
rules
they
wanted.
now,
couldn't
we
hold
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
haven't
suggested
leaving
it
up
to
each
state,
because
you're
suggesting
a
uniform
rule.
so,
what...
how
would
you
have
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
it's
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
default
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
it's
just
a
default
rule,
that's
a
big
improvement,
because
any
state
can
do
it
any
way
it
wants.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then,
why
not,
here,
send
it
back
and
say
that
the
alj
tried
to
answer
the
wrong
question?
he
tried
to
answer
the
question
of
what
was
the
federal
law,
but
what
he
really
should
have
done
was
ask
about
what's
the
state
law.
and
if
he
has
a
hard
time
figuring
it
out,
perhaps
he
should
look
at
that
evidence
harder
and
see.
maybe--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
but
i've
never
heard
of
a
state
without
law.
there
is
no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--black
hole
in
the
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why?
why
should
it
be?
i
mean,
that's
very
interesting
to
me.
why
shouldn't
the
law
be
such
that
particularly...
you
have
evidence
on
both
sides
and
a
neutral
decision
maker
who
sits
there...
that
it
encourages
that
decision
maker
to
decide.
it's
one
thing
if
the
record's
blank.
but
not
where
they
have
a
lot
of
experts.
decide.
don't
retreat
to
something
like
announcing,
"oh,
it's
in
equipoise".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sure,
but
then
to
do
that
is
not
really
to
look
to
the
interests
of
the
child
or
the
board.
i
mean,
it
is
to
allow
a
sort
of
doctrine
from
left
field,
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits,
to
decide
the
case.
