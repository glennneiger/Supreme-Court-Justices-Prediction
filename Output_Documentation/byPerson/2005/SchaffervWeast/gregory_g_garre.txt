mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
petitioners
rejected
the
educational
plan
found
appropriate
by
local
school
officials,
enrolled
their
child
in
an
expensive
private
school,
and
then
filed
a
due
process
complaint
seeking
reimbursement
of
$21,000
in
private
tuition
expenses.
the
court
of
appeals
properly
held
that
petitioners
bore
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
proceeding,
just
like--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--o'connor.
petitioners
bore
the
burden
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
your
honor,
we
think
the
rule
is
the
same
in
all
of
the
various
situations
that
could
arise
under
the
statute...
the
complaining
party,
whether
it's
the
parents,
as
in
this
case,
or
the
school
district,
as
in
many
other
instances.
and,
justice
breyer,
you're
right,
one
of
the
situations
that
is
covered
by
this
statute
is
where
a
child
with
a
disability
acts
out
in
class,
and
the
school
has
to
take
disciplinary
action
against
that
child.
in
that
situation,
idea
regulates
the
actions
that
the
school
district
can
take.
and
if
the
parents
believe
that
the
school
district
has...
take
a
more
severe
disciplinary
action
than
is
required
by
the
statute,
school...
the
school
district,
or
the
parents,
could
initiate
a
challenge
in
that
situation.
in
fact,
there
are
many
parts
of
the
statute
that
we
think
speak
to
the
question,
or
at
least--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
the
child
was
in
a
private
school,
at
which
point
in
time,
the
private
school
suggested
that
they
find...
the
parents
find
another
environment
for
the
child
suitable
for
what
they
determined
to
be
"special
needs".
the
parents
contacted
the
local
school
district,
and,
at
that
point,
the
school
district,
in
conjunction
with
the
parents,
devised
an
educational
plan
for
the
child.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
except
that
the
record
does
show
that,
during
the
time
that
the
iep
was
being
developed,
the
parents
applied
for
the
child
to
attend
a
private
school
and
actually
accepted
an
application
fee
and
enrolled
the
child
in
that
school,
and
the
alj
in
this
case
found
that
the
parents
had
made
a
predetermined
decision
to
send
the
student
to
child...
the
student--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--to
private
school.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
bear
on
the
question
of
who
bears
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
run
of
the
mine
case.
it's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
there
are
three
situations
in
which
the
school
district
can
be
the
complaining
party.
first,
where
a
parent
refuses
to
subject
his
child
to
evaluation
for
special
services
under
the
act,
and
the
school
district
disagrees
and
initiates
that
action.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
under
the
statute--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
congress
placed
on
school
districts
the
obligation
to
identify
disabled
children
within
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
when
they
have...
they
believe
they
identified
such
children,
and
they
request
the
parents
to
subject
them
to
the
evaluation...
congress
placed
on
the
school
districts
to
at
least
conduct
an
evaluation
in
that
situation,
and
if
parents
disagree--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--school
districts
can
initiate.
the
second
situation
is
in...
is
where
children
act
up
in
the
classroom.
the
school...
the
statute
places
restrictions
on
how
the
school
district
can
discipline
a
child
if
the
school
district
determines
that
the
misbehavior
is
a
manifestation
of
the
child's
disability.
in
that
situation,
if
the...
if
the
school
district
believes
that
more
severe
discipline
is
warranted
than
would
be
allowed
under
the
statute,
the
school
district
has
to
initiate
the
hearing
in
order
to
get
an
alj
to
allow
it
to
take
more
severe
action.
and
the
third
situation
is
where
the
school
district
disagrees
with
a
parent's
request
for
an
independent
educational
evaluation.
parents
can
request,
as
part
of
the
developmental
process
of
an
educational
plan,
to
have
an
independent
educational
evaluation
conducted
on
their
child,
paid
for
at
public
expense.
most
of
the
times,
that's
conducted
without
incidence.
in
some
situations,
if
school
districts
believe
that
that
expense
was
not
warranted,
they
could
initiate
a
proceeding.
and
in
all
those
cases,
we
acknowledge
that...
under
the
traditional
rule,
that
the
complaining
party,
the
party
that
initiates
the
action
and
seeks
relief,
bears
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
proceeding.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
don't
have
those
statistics.
i
would...
i
think
it's
probably
true
that
in
most
instances
it's
the
parents
who
are
initiating
the
hearing.
that
would
not
have
been
news
to
congress,
however.
congress,
in
the
statute...
and
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
we
think
is
important,
bearing
on
the
burden
of
proof...
placed
on
parents
the
obligation
to
plead
their
case...
that
is,
to
identify
both
the
problem
with
the
educational
plan
that
they've
seen...
and
this
is
in
20
u.s.c.
1450(b)(7)...
as
well
as
the
proposed
solution
that
they
would...
that
they
would
like
to
see
the
court
adopt.
now--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the...
your
honor,
that's
correct.
i
think
that
the
district
court
also
acknowledged,
though,
that
the
parents
probably
were
interested
in
sending
their
child
to
private
school.
i
think,
either
way,
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
record
in
this
case
requires
the
court
to
take
one
result
or
another
on
the
fundamental
question
of
who
bears
the
burden
of
proof.
we
think
that
the
complaining
party
bears
the
burden
of
proof.
that's
the
rule--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
your
honor,
and,
in
fact,
we've
suggested
that.
in
fact--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor,
to
be
clear,
we
think
that
this...
that
the
statute
establishes
a
federal
floor.
it
is
spending
clause...
a
federal
floor...
it
is...
or
a
default
rule
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--unless--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--exactly.
that
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
you
just
heard
mr.
hurd
acknowledge
that
there
is
no
statute
or
regulation
on
this.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and,
your
honor,
the
maryland
case
law
adopts
a
traditional
rule
for
administrative
proceedings.
we
cite
the
case,
in
page
18
of
the
red
brief.
importantly,
though,
what
petitioners--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--these
cases...
the
congress
gave
them
the
right
to
bring
a
civil
action
in
federal
court.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor,
i
think...
we
analogize
it
to
the
question
of
the
substantive
amount
of
benefits
to
which
parents
are
entitled
under
the
act.
we
think
that
this
spending
clause
legislation
would
allow
a
state
to
adopt
a
higher
standard
than
the
standard
that
this
court
established
in
rowley
for
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education,
and
that
that
would
be
the
standard
that
would
apply
in
a
proceeding.
and
so,
too,
we
think,
with
the
question
of
the
burden
of
proof.
if
states
wanted
to
voluntarily
assume
the
burden
of
proof
for
their
own
school
districts
in
these
proceedings,
which
this
court
has
characterized
as
a
substantive
rule
of
law...
the
question
of
who
bears
the
burden
of
proof...
we
think
that
states
could
do
so,
and
that
that
would
be
the
rule
that
applies.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe...
i
believe
eight
states
have
said
that.
three
states...
at
least
three
states
have
said
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
parents
in
these
proceedings.
some
states
have
taken
different
views
and
said
if...
i
believe
it's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--minnesota
has
said
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor,
because
of
the
spending
clause
nature
of
the
legislation.
that's
what
we
think,
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--this
establishes
a
federal
floor
that
states
can
go
beyond
if
they
want
to
assume
more
costs
under
the
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
justice
scalia,
we
agree,
in
the
sense
that
we
think
that
the
statute
establishes
at
least
a
default
rule.
and,
just
to
be
clear,
if
the
court
holds
that
federal
law
establishes
the
traditional
rule,
then,
obviously,
we
would
be
very
happy
with
that
decision.
what
we...
what
we
reject
to
strenuously
is
petitioner's
position
that
federal
law
imposes
an
unstated
burden
on
the
school
districts
in
all
proceedings
initiated
under
the
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that
would
be--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
justice
stevens,
congress
has
answered
that
problem,
in
the
sense
that
it
requires,
in
response
to
a
complaint,
the
school
district
to
submit
the
proposed...
the
iep,
the
educational
plan,
it's
adopted,
as
well
as
the
other
considerations...
the
other
options
it
considered
and
why
it
didn't
accept
those
other
options.
so,
that
evidence...
and
i
think
we're
talking
about
the
burden
of
production--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--burden
persuasion
there...
that
evidence
already
is
required
to
be
exchanged
and
disclosed.
here--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
the
way
it's
done
in
the
states
right
now
is,
where,
in
the
jurisdictions
where
school
districts
bear
the
burden
of
persuasion,
they
are
required
to
go
first.
and
that
increases
the
costs
and
complexity
of
these
trials
for
school
districts,
because
the...
before
the
parents
have
put
on
their
evidence
as
to
why
they
think
an
educational
plan
is
inappropriate
or
is...
in
this
case,
why
they
think
the
school
district
hasn't
properly
characterized
their
child's
disability,
the
school
district
has
to
go
forward
and
present
its
case,
which
is
a
more
complex...
it's...
there's
more
guesswork
involved--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
stevens.
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
unusual
rule.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
absolutely
correct,
and
that's
certainly
the
way
that
we
think
it
would...
it
would,
more
preferably,
operate
under
the
statute.
but
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is,
who
bears
the
burden
of
persuasion?
that's
a
very
important
question
under
the
act.
it's
not
just,
with
respect,
an
academic
question
about
the
number
of
cases
in
with...
in
which
the
evidence
is
mathematically
in
equipoise.
it
is
going
not
have
a
much
broader
impact
on
the
implementation
of
the
statute,
because
it's
going
to
be
decisive,
or
at
least
potentially
decisive,
in
cases
like
this,
where
you've
got
a
battle
of
the
experts.
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the...
we
would
agree
with
you,
justice
breyer,
but,
in
practice,
many
of
these
cases,
the
dispute
is
over
the
provision
of
experimental
therapies
for
children
with
disabilities,
particularly
children
with
autism,
where
medically
and
educationally--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
your
honor.
we
think
that
what
it
is
to
do
is
to
give
effect
to
the
traditional
presumption
of
regularity,
which
is,
ultimately...
if
you
do
have
a
tie,
whose
judgment
ought
to
be
given
effect?
and
under
the
statute,
where
congress
recognized
that
state
and
local
governments
would
retain
the
primary
authority
over
educational
decisions...
and
in
the
rowley
case,
where
this
court
reaffirmed
that...
we
think
that,
combined
with
the
traditional
presumption
of
regularity...
which
is
that
the
actions
and
decisions
of
public
officials
are
presumed
to
be
taken
in
good
faith,
and
presumed
to
be
correct...
those
factors
counsel
strongly
in
favor
of
the
traditional
rule
here.
petitioners--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
if
you're
talking
about
an
affirmative
defense
or
something
beyond
the
threshold
question
of
whether
there
has
been
discrimination,
or
as
in
a
social
security
act
case
question
of
whether
an
eligible
person
has
been
denied
the
benefits--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--to
which
he's
entitled--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
the
plaintiff
would
still
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
is...
he
or
she
has
been
discriminated
against--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
that's
my
threshold--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
my
threshold
point--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
that's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
when
we
talk
about
the
burden
of
proof,
we're
talking
about
the
essential
elements
of
the
claim,
whether
there's
been
a
violation.
so
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--so
i
think
we're
asking--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--a
different
question.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't...
in
that
situation,
there
may
be...
i
mean,
in
the
same
way
that,
in
the
sentencing,
in
the
criminal
context,
other
considerations
come
into
play,
it
doesn't
resolve
it
here.
placing
the
burden
of
proofing
on
school
districts
in
these
proceedings
would
erode
the
trust
and
confidence
that
congress
placed
in
the
judgments
of
state
and
local
educational
officials.
it
would
create
a
demoralizing
and
destabilizing
educational
regime
in
which
the
judgments--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but,
your
honor,
congress
found
that
state
and
local
governments
would
retain
the
primary
responsibility
for
making
educational--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--decisions
under
the
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--our
position
is
that...
is
that
the
federal
law
creates
a
floor,
justice
scalia,
that
congress
established
the
rules--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
it
thought
was
appropriate,
and
then
states--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
that
situation,
though,
states
are
voluntarily
assuming
the
burden
on
their
own
school
districts.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
here--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
that
the
cost
of
the
hearings...
there
are
not
statistics
on
that,
precisely,
but
the
cost
of
hearings
are
going
to
be
greater,
because
school
districts--
thank
you,
your
honor.
