justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
his
statement
was
false?
do
you
contend
the
speech
was
false?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
disposition
by
the...
i
mean,
his
grievance
by
the
hearing
examiner
was
that
there
was
no
retaliation.
he
assumed
that
the
speech
was
proper
and
there
was
no
inefficiency
or
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
speaker.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
in
my
understanding,
that
was
the
only
defense
that
was
made
for
the
charge,
that,
"we
didn't
retaliate".
there
was
no
claim
that
the
speech
was
improper
in
any
way.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
we
assume,
for
purposes
of
our
case,
that
what
he
said
was
totally
accurate
and
did
not,
itself,
provide
the
basis
for
saying
he
was
incompetent
or
something
of
that...
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
give--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--greater
protection
to
a
public
speech
than
to
a
comment
from...
on
the
job
from...
to
one's
superior.
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
statement
that
would
provide...
be
entitled
to
complete
first
amendment
protection
if
made
in
a
speech,
but
could
justify
a
discharge
if
made
face
to
face
with
your
employer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
statement
that
would
be
protected
in
a
public
speech,
but,
if
made
privately
to
your
superior,
could
provide
the
basis
for
a
discharge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--protected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--responding
to
my
question.
my
question
is,
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
statement
that
would
be
entitled
to
protection
if
made
in
a
public
speech,
but
could
be
a
basis
for
discharge
if
made
face
to
face?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--asking
you
if--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
he
says
privately
could
the
basis
for
a
discharge.
surely,
he
couldn't
be
discharged
for
what
you
just
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
himmelfarb,
in
that
case
he
could
also
be
fired
if
he
made
the
statement
in
a
speech,
could
he
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
could
he
not
be
fired
if
the
scenario
you
just
described
as--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
seems
to
me
odd
that
the
employee
has
greater
protection
if
he
goes
outside
the
regular
channels
and
makes
a
speech
than
if
he
does...
he
goes
right
to
his
superior
and
says,
"i
think
this
is
what's
wrong
and
should
be
remedied.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
have
no
constitutional
protection.
but
if
you
go
ahead
and
make
a
speech,
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
has
less
constitutional
protection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
the
givhan
case
fall
within
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
suggesting--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
a
remark
made
internally
could
not
provide
the
basis
for
discipline,
but
saying
exactly
the
same
thing
publicly
could.
i
mean...
or
vice
versa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
assuming--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
case
in
which
it
would
be
constitutionally
protected.
but
you're
saying
if
he
says
it
publicly...
assuming
we
pass
the
balancing
test...
that
if
he
said
the
same
thing
to
his
boss
directly
internally,
no
protection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--rule
that
would
sort
of
encourage
people
to
go
public
rather
than--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--exhaust
their
internal
remedies.
