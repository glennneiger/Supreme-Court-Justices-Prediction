ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ever
since
pickering,
it
has
been
the
law
that
the
first
amendment
protects
public
employees
from
being
fired
or
punished
for
expressing
views
on
matters
of
public
importance
where,
as
here,
there
is
no
harm
or
disruption
to
their
employers.
petitioners
in...
the
united
states
asked
this
court
to
scrap
that.
it
is
not
just
the
ninth
circuit.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
that's
correct.
but
it's
been
the--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
qualifier
has
always
been
used
in
conjunction
with
the
phase
"on
matters
of
public
concern".
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
it--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--it
was
used
exclusively
to
explain,
and
especially
to
look
at
the
context
in
which
the
phrase
first
appears,
in
pickering,
that
public
employees,
like
all
citizens,
have
an
interest--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--on
matters--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--speaking
on
a
matter
of
public
concern
only
gets
the
employee
presumptive
first
amendment
protection.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
there
would
be
a
pickering
balance,
yes.
and
the
pickering
balancing
test
is
quite
deferential
to
the
employer.
the
court
observed,
in
the
pickering
case,
that
it's
proper
to
look...
that
a
court
should
look
at
the
proper
performance
of
the
employee's
daily
duties.
in
rankin,
the
court
talked
about
the
questions
whether
the
speech
interferes
with
work,
personnel
relationships,
or
the
speaker's
job
performance.
the
bar
is
already
quite
high
for
the
employee,
coupled
with
causation
burdens,
qualified
immunity,
and
so
on.
and
so,
it
is
not
the
case
that
just
because
a...
an
employee
speaks
on
a
matter
of
public
concern,
that
that
employee
is
necessarily
going
to
win
a
first
amendment
case.
also--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--no,
i
think...
it's
not
quite
right.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
just
looked
at
whether
his
speech
was
reporting
government
misconduct,
a
type
of
speech
that
the
circuit
said
uniformly
recognized
was
of
paramount
public
importance.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
and--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--with--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--with
respect,
i
don't--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--with--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--with
respect,
the
public
concern
threshold
is
not
so
easily
met.
the
court
has
said--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--maybe.
maybe
not.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
but
the
court
has--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--right.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
right.
i--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--if
the
supervisor
told
mr.
ceballos
that
there
was
something
wrong
in
the
manner
in
which
he
conveyed
his
speech,
and
told
him
to
revise
the
memo,
that
would
have
been...
he
would
have
been
well
within
his
rights
to
do
so.
bear
in
mind
that
there's
never
been
an
argument
here
that
there
was
anything
inappropriate
about
mr.
ceballos's
speech,
that
he
exercised
poor
judgment,
that
there
was
anything
disruptive
about
the
manner
in
which
he
communicated.
the
head
of
the
office--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--actually
said--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--it's--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--yes.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
yes.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
it
is--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
principle
is
that
an
employer...
we
agree
with
the
position
of
the
united
states,
that
the
employer
has
the
ability
to
dictate
how
an
employee
carries
out
his
duties.
in
a
case
where
the
employee--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--is
insubordinate--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--it
would
be
not
on
that
ground.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
the
reason
it
would
be
thrown
out
in
summary
judgment
would
be
because
the
employer
had
a
different
reason
for
taking
retaliatory
action--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--against
the
employee.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
virtually
all
of
these
cases
are
able
to
be
disposed
of
at
summary
judgment.
and
you
have,
basically,
20
years
of
litigation
in
the
circuit
courts
to
look
at
where--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
problems
that
are
being
posited
haven't
materialized.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
the
judge
looks
first
at
whether
the
speech
is
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
and
if
it's
a
dispute
over
government
misconduct,
it
would
meet
that
threshold.
second,
the
court
would
proceed
to
a
pickering
balance
and
would
say
the
employer's
actual
reason
for
retaliating
or
taking
action
would
be
because
of
the...
you
know,
the
tone
or
the
message
or
because
it
was
a
disagreement,
and
the
supervisor's
views
ultimately
prevail.
and
so,
that's
how
it
would
be--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--analyzed.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
with
respect,
no.
these
cases
are
not
that
hard
to
dispose
of
at
summary
judgment.
most
actions
that
employers
take
against
the
employees
are
not
because
of
the
employees'
speech
anyway,
it's
because
of
how
they
carry
out
their
job
functions.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
respectfully,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
most
of
these
cases...
they
don't
go
to
trial,
most
of
them.
they're...
of
course,
there
are
some
trials,
but
that
is
not
the
way
most
of
these
cases
are
handled.
and,
besides
that,
adding
an
extra
test,
another
preliminary
hurdle,
wouldn't
change
the
litigation
burden.
instead
of
it
being
the
connick
pickering
test,
it
would
be
connick
pickering
ceballos
test.
and
then
the
question
would
be,
was
the
person
doing
their
job?
how
do
you
decide
that?
is
it
in
his
job
description?
is
it
a
matter
of
custom
and
practice?
what
if
he's
doing
extra
credit
work
to
build
up
goodwill
with
his
employer,
but
it's
something
that's
not--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--ordinarily
required?
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
as
long
as
he's
made
an...
as
long
as
he's
made
allegations
or
spoken
in
good
faith
in
their...
and
it
isn't
demonstrably
false,
then
he
would
clear
that
initial
hurdle.
and
there
certainly
was
nothing
suggesting
that
he
spoke
in
bad
faith
or
was
obviously
false,
whether
or
not
he
was
correct
in
his
assessment.
and
it
wasn't
just
an
argument
over
a
tire
rim.
he
accused
these...
the
deputy
sheriff
here
of
perjury.
it
was
a
quite
serious
allegation
of
government
misconduct
that
was
made
here,
and
not,
sort
of,
a
mundane
dispute
over--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--whether
or
not--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--ceballos
was
not
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
government
when
he
went
to
his
supervisor.
that
was
an
internal
communication
to
his
supervisor
reporting--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--right.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
it
was
part
of
his
job,
although
i...
i'd
quibble
with
the
idea
that
it
was
required
by
his
job.
but
it
was
part
of
his
job.
and,
in
doing
so,
he
spoke
to
the
government,
not
as
the
government.
a
better
analogy
with
respect
to
rust
would
be
if
the
doctor
in
rust...
let's
say
it's
a
doctor
at
a
public
university
hospital,
and
the
doctor
was
told
that
the
policy
is
not
to
engage
in
abortion
counseling.
and
he
wrote
a
memo
to
the
supervisor
saying,
"this
is
a
terribly
policy.
"
"this
is
inhibiting
our
ability
to
counsel
my
patients
and
for
me
to
do
my
job
correctly.
"
that
memo
would
not
be
the
government's
message.
and
ceballos's
memo
here
to
his
supervisor
was
also
not
the
government's
message.
but
i
want
to...
i
want
to
get--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--but
this
is
a
very
malleable
and
manipulable
concept,
what's
part
of
a
job.
i
mean,
for
a
doctor
to
talk
to
his
supervisor
about
a
restriction
that
he
feels
is
inhibiting
his
ability
to
counsel
his
patients
is
as
much
part
of
his
job
as
a
prosecutor
going
to
his
supervisor
and
saying,
"there's
government
misconduct
in
this
case,
and
we
need
to
do
something
about
it.
"
just
like
a
teacher
in
the
givhan
case,
going
to
her
principal,
a
conference
between
a
teacher
and
her
principal
about
whether
there's
racial...
racially
discriminatory
practices
in
the
school
would
be
part
of
a
teacher's
job,
complaining
about
something
that
affects
her
students.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
well,
i
think
that
underscores
the
point,
that
the
employee
in
givhan
was
speaking
both
as
an
employee
and
as
a
citizen,
and
these
roles
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
you
can
be
both.
there's
no
artificial
distinction
that
the
court
has
drawn
here.
and
where
a
government
employee
comes
forward
and
reports
misconduct
and
puts
himself
at
risk,
he
is
doing
just
that,
speaking
in
both
capacities.
and--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
court...
the
court
always
views
the
"as
a
citizen"
language
in
conjunction
with
the...
speaking
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
equated
the
two
concepts.
but
i
want
to
get
to
why
it
is
unwise
and
unjustified
to
draw
the
per
se
rule
that
petitioners
are
urging
here.
for
one,
it
essentially
means
that
a
public
employee
such
as
ceballos
has
to
go
public
in
order
to
have
presumptive
first
amendment
protection.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct.
it's
a
trap.
they
don't
tell
you
about
what
happened
in
the
second
case.
if
ceballos
had
taken
suspicions
of
police
misconduct
and
gone
to
the
los
angeles
times,
they
would
have
fired
him.
and
had
he
brought
a
case
challenging
that
termination
under
the
first
amendment,
he
would
have
lost
on
under
the
pickering
balance.
the
circuit--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--yes.
if
he
had
evaded
proper
internal
channels
of
communication,
then
the
employer
would
be
well
within
his
rights
to
fire
him
for
taking
an
action
that's
so
disruptive
in
bringing...
discrediting
the
office
without
even
letting
his
own
employer
try
to
address
the
situation
internally
first.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
closer
question.
i
think
he
probably
still
loses,
but
it's
a
closer
question.
i
think,
at
some
point,
if
the
magnitude
of
this...
of
the
problem
is
so
large...
i
mean,
imagine
in
the
ramparts
scandal
situation
if...
which
has
been
discussed
in
the
briefs...
if
a
prosecutor
tried
to
deal
with
that
within
the
da's
office,
and
failed
to
get
any
response,
and
then
went
public
with
the
ramparts
scandal,
something
of
such
magnitude,
a
court
perhaps
would
find
their
way.
but
in
the--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--individual--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
court
held,
in
both
givhan
and
rankin,
that
private
communications
on
matters
of
public
concern
are
still
protected.
and
it's...
and
there's
very
good
reasons
for
that
to
be.
i
mean,
imagine
an
employee
at
fema
who
thinks
that
fema
is
not
ready
to
handle
the
next
hurricane,
that
it
has
problems
in
its
disaster
preparedness,
and
so
that
fema
employee
goes
to
his
supervisor
and
says,
"we
have
problems
here.
"
"here
are
the
four
areas
in
which
we're
not
ready
to
handle
the
next
hurricane.
"
he
gets
fired,
because
the
supervisor
doesn't
want
to
hear
that.
it's
critically
important
that
public
employees
who
have
information,
who
know
what
ails
the
agencies
that
they
work
for,
be
able
to
find
an
avenue
to
communicate
issues
of
public
importance.
if
that
fema
employee
had
gone--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--yes.
the
standard
isn't
anything
of
public
interest,
it's
something
of
legitimate
news
interest.
the
court
reiterated
that
recently
in
the
roe
case.
the
standard
does...
it's
not
a--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--newsworthy.
and
it's
the
same
test--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
court
has
applied
in
invasion
of
privacy
contexts.
it's...
although
it's
a
broad
standard,
but
it's
also
a
well
known
and
well
established
standard
that--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--courts
are
using--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--correct.
the
line
the
court
was
drawing
in
connick
is
between
the
personal
and
the
public.
the
court
said
that,
had
the
prosecutor
in
that
case
come
forward
had...
to
bring
to
light
actual
potential
wrongdoing,
a
breach
of
public
trust,
the
court
suggested
strongly
that
that
would
have
been
a
matter
of
public
concern,
and
that
the
court
would
then--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--have
proceeded
to
the
pickering
balance.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
if
he's
talking--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--two
things.
one
is
that
if
the
public
employee
is
basically
reporting
something
corrupt
in
the--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--in
the
workplace.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct.
and--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--in
government--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
test
the
court
enunciated
in
connick
is
public,
social,
or...
excuse
me...
political,
social,
or
other
concerns
is
up
to
the
community.
if
it's
something
that
would
be
of
legitimate
news
and--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--then
potentially--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--but
it
has
to
be
legitimate
news
interest.
and
the
court...
the
courts
have
not
usually
taken
idle
gossip
to
meet
that
test.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
no.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
certainly--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--at
a
minimum,
a
report
of
government
misconduct
by
an
employee
to
his
supervisor,
at
a
minimum,
should
be
treated
as
meeting
whatever
threshold
the
court
establishes.
and
there's
something
that
all
the
all
circuits
that
have
addressed
this
point
agree,
that
whistleblower
types
of
speech
is
of
paramount
public--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--concern.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
because
government
misconduct
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
government
accountability
and
the
public's
ability
to
hold
officials
accountable
when
there
is--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--but
if--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--well,
they
have
a
first
amendment
interest
in
their
speech,
but
they
have
no
claim,
because
if
the...
if
you
fired
them
just
because--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--you
know,
it
would
depend
why...
it
would
depend
why
you
fired
them.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
all
right.
but
if
you're
firing
them
because
you
think
they've
exercised
poor
judgment
in
the...
in
the
way
that
they've
communicated,
then
it's--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--in
the
hypothetical
you
gave
me,
it
doesn't...
i
mean,
it
doesn't
sound
like
a
serious
claim
of
government
misconduct.
it
sounds
like
more
like
an
offhand
remark
with...
which,
if
you
thought
it
was
inappropriate,
you
might
be
able
to
take
action
against
that
employee.
here,
we
have
a
very
grave
allegation
to
public...
of
government
misconduct,
not
casually
made.
i
mean,
the...
mr.
ceballos
talked
to--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--other
people--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--my
client
carefully
considered
what
the...
what
the
allegations
were
in
the
case,
and
they
talked
to
people
in
this
office.
so
seriously
did
the
supervisors
take
it
that
they
actually
released
somebody
who
pleaded
guilty,
who
was
in
custody
for
seven
months,
and
let
them
out
on
their
own
recognizance,
because
that's
how
seriously...
what
a
problem
they
thought,
in
his
office,
they
had
with
this...
the
affidavit.
it
was
only
after
the
meeting
with
the
sheriff's
department
where
they,
kind
of,
launched
into
him
exactly
like
a
public
defender,
did
the
tide
turn.
so,
we're
not...
it's
not
a
casual
dispute
over
tire
tracks,
or
not
tire
tracks,
in
this
case.
but
getting
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
drawing
lines,
i
think
that's
just--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--there's
an...
with
respect,
i
think
there's--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--i'm
not
sure
i
can
answer
that.
[laughter]
i'll
take
that
as
a
rhetorical
question.
but,
to
get
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
there's
also...
i
think
this
came
up
in...
when
my
opposing
counsel
was
talking,
about
this
extra
element
present
here,
which
is
that
there
is
an
independent
constitutional
problem
here,
in
that
when
you
have
a...
police
misconduct,
you
have
someone
whose
right
to
fair
trial
are
at
stake,
and
you
have
a
prosecutor
who's
trying
to
fulfill
his
individual
ethical
and
constitutional
obligation--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--on
top
of
it.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
had
ceballos
remained
silent,
however,
then
this
speech
would
never
have
been
aired,
and
police
misconduct--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--would
go
unchecked.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
if
the
government
takes
action
because
the
employee
has
exercised...
has
done...
carried
out
his
job
in
an
inappropriate
way
that
reflects
a
lack
of
fitness
or
poor
judgment
and
what
have
you,
the
employer's
within
his
rights
to
do
so.
the
court
acknowledged
that
in
pickering,
it
acknowledged
that
in
rankin.
that
has
never
really
been
an
issue
in
the
court's
cases.
and
it's
not--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--our
position--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--correct.
i
agree
with
that
standard.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
that--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--that's
already
the
case.
almost
all
these
cases
go
to
summary
judgment.
it's
almost
impossible
to
dismiss
one
of
these
cases
on
a
pleading.
that's
true
even
in
the
fourth
circuit.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
respectfully,
that's
not
correct.
even
in
the
fourth
circuit--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--i
understand
that,
but
that
argument
is
unfounded.
even
in
the
fourth
circuit,
which
has
come
closest
to
adopting
the
per
se
rule
the
petitioners
are
asking
for,
district
courts...
and
there's
a
case
we
cited
in
our
brief,
echtenkamp...
it's
from
the
eastern
district
of
virginia...
where
the
court
said,
in
trying
to
decide,
"did
the
employee
speak
as
a
citizen
or
as
an
employee?
"
this
is
going
to
take
factual
development.
we
can't
decide
this
on
the
pleadings.
it's
going
to--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--have
to
go
to
summary
judgment.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
i
can
only
say
based
looking
at
published
cases--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--on
westlaw.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
there
seem
to
be
around
60
or
70
court
of
appeals
cases--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--a
year.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
each
year,
for
the
least
five
years,
about--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--60
or
70
court
of
appeals
cases.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
in
all
of
the
circuits.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
yes,
in
all
of
the
circuits.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
there's
around
a
hundred
a
year
in
the
district
courts
that
appear
on
westlaw,
each
year
for
the
last
five
years.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
that's
incorrect.
the
whistleblower
statutes,
which
are
sort
of
a
patchwork
nationwide,
protect,
or
at
least
they
have
the
ability
to
protect,
speech
beyond
what
the
first
amendment
does.
if
you
take
the
federal
whistleblower
protection
statute,
for
example,
if
an
employee
makes
a
protected
disclosure,
and
an
employer
takes
a
prohibited
action
in
response,
there's
no
balancing.
the
employee
wins.
the
causation
burden
is
also
lower.
the
agency's
on
the
hook
for
paying
the
money.
there's
no
immunity,
and
so
on.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
it
does.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
there
wasn't
a
claim
made
under
it.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
there
was
not
a--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--did
not
bring
a
claim
under
california
whistle
blowing--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
i--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--understood
the
question--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--no,
i
understood
her
question
to
be
whether
they're
rendered
superfluous.
whistleblower
statutes
are
patchwork
across
the
country.
some
would
cover
this
kind
of
speech,
some
would
not.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
not
all
whistleblower
statutes
cover
internal
communications.
some
do--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--some
don't--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
i'm
sorry?
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
yes.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
yes.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
well,
no,
that's
not...
that's
not
correct.
i
mean,
in...
many
of
the
statutes
do
cover
internal,
and
some
don't.
in
some,
you
have
to
go
to
a
legislature,
or
you
have
to
go...
take
it
to
a
certain
outside
organization
or
entity
in
order
to
cover
it,
and--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--some
internal--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
federal
circuit
has
interpreted
the
federal
whistleblower
statute
to
narrow
the
protection,
so
if
it's
within
your
normal
duties
of
employment,
then
it
would
excluded.
but
if
i
could...
if
i
can...
just
for
a
moment,
i
want
to
return...
i've
hinted...
i've
hinted
at
this
somewhat,
but
i
haven't...
oh,
i
see
my
time's
up.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
thank
you.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
contend
that
the
first
amendment
provides
no
protection
when
the
government
silences
or
punishes
a
public
employee
for
speaking
up
on
a
matter
of
vital
public
importance
in
the
course
of
performing
his
job,
even
if
the
government
has
no
legitimate
employment
reason
for
doing
so.
such
a
sweeping
rule
would
stifle
speech
that
lies
at
the
very
core
of
the
first
amendment.
recognizing
richard
ceballos's
claim
in
this
case
would
not
convert
every
public
employment
dispute
into
a
constitutional
case.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
i
agree
with
that.
the
first
amendment
doesn't
bar
the
government
from
disciplining
employees
for
insubordination
or
poor
job
performance
or
for
continuing
or
persisting
in
a
matter
once
their
supervisor's
told
them
to
stop.
where
an
adverse
employment
action's
motivated
by
such
legitimate
employment
reasons,
there's
no
first
amendment
violation.
but
the
petitioners
here
have
not
claimed
any
legitimate
interest
in
punishing
ceballos
for
what
he
said,
nor
have
they
made
the
case--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--that
is
not
correct.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--they've
articulated
that
as
an
abstract
principle
that
has
no
application
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
on
the--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--facts
of...
sorry.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
on
the
facts
of
this--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--case,
they
never
claim
that
ceballos
did
anything
improper,
that
he
exercised
poor
judgment,
that
he
was
insubordinate.
they
just
said,
"we
didn't
retaliate".
that
was
their
defense
of
this
case.
and
that
presents
a
fact
question
for
the
jury.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
with
respect,
i
disagree
with
the
characterization,
because...
well,
there
are
three
reasons
why
petitioners
proposed
per
se
rule,
which
would
be
unwise.
and
it
is
they
who
are
asking
for
a
per
se
exclusion
where
the
court
has
not
previously
adopted
a
per
se
exclusion.
and
the
reason
why
it's
unwise
is
that
it
will
chill
speech
of
paramount
public
importance
by
prosecutors
and
many
other
public
employees.
it
will
force
many
public
employees
to
go
public
if
they
want
any
chance
of
constitutional
protection,
and
it
will
lead
to
arbitrary
and
unworkable
linedrawing
regarding
whether
an
employee's
speech
falls--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--within
his
job
duties.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
absolutely.
the
court
has
recognized,
in
pickering
and
in
other
cases,
that
the
threat
of
dismissal
from
public
employment
is
a
potent
means
of
inhibiting
speech.
public
employees
who
speak
up
within
their
workplaces
about
police
brutality,
falsification
of
evidence,
disaster
preparedness,
and
so
on,
should
not
be
compelled
to
shade
the
reports
and
the
recommendations
and
tell
their
superiors
only
what
they
want
to
hear
or
else
face
reprisal
for
their
candor.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
that's
absolutely--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--that's
absolutely
correct.
and
if,
in
this
case,
that
judgment
had
been
made
by
ceballos's
employer,
that
he
had
exercised
poor
judgment,
that
he
was
rash
or
reckless
in
his
conclusions,
then
the
employer
would
have
had
a
valid
basis
for
taking
an
adverse
employment
action
against
him.
but
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
well,
actually,
the
disagreement...
there
wasn't
any
disagreement.
he
came
forward
and
exposed
police
misconduct.
and
his
supervisors
were
on
his
side.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
i
don't
think
it's
important,
for,
maybe,
purposes
of
this,
to
iron
this
out,
but
i...
respectfully,
i
don't
agree
with
that
characterization,
because,
even
in
the
resolution
of
the
grievance
internally,
the...
what
they
found
in
the
grievance
was
that
they
took
no
adverse
action
against
him
because
of
what
he
said--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--in
connection
with
this
case.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
no--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--okay.
there
are
a
few
points
embedded
in
the
question,
and
i'd
like
to
take
them
one
by
one.
with
respect
to
the
standard,
the
standard
is,
if
the
employer
makes
a
judgment
that
the
public
employee
has
not
performed
his
or
her
job
properly
or
has
been
insubordinate,
so
long
as
that
judgment
isn't
based
on
a
censorial
type
motive,
like,
"we
don't
tolerate
criticism
of
the
sheriff's
department.
"
something
like
that,
then
the
employer's
judgment
prevails.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
a
district...
federal
district
court
has
license
to
second
guess
that
judgment,
so
long
as
that
judgment's
actually
the
judgment
that
was
made.
i
mean,
there's
a
pretext
analysis
that
might
be
made
in
this
case--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--well,
in
a
case
like
this,
the
county
never
came
forward--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--and
said
that--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--but--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--well--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--that's
why
i
said
that
it
would
be
subject
to
a
pretext
analysis.
the
employer,
of
course,
might
come
back
and...
and,
post
hoc,
come
up
with
a
rationale
for--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--why
they
did--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--what
they
did.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
you
know--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--we're
not
operating
in
uncharted
territory
here.
the
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted
has
been
the
prevailing
rule
in
the
circuits
for
years.
and
i
just
want
to
clarify
something
that
came
up
in
the
last
argument,
where
i
cited
some
very
rough
statistics
about
the
numbers
of
cases.
there's
a
rough...
a
rough
cut
at
the
universe
of
public
employee
free
speech
cases,
of
which
this
type
of
case,
where
the
speech
is
part
of
the
job,
is
only
a
tiny
subset.
these
cases
are
not
dominating
the
courts,
and
you
don't
have
all
the
litigation
that
is
being--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--claimed
would
occur.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
no,
that's...
actually
gets
me
back
to
the
second
part
of
justice
breyer's
question,
which
is
protection.
and
it's
a
complete
hit
or
miss
situation
across
the
country.
and
just
to
respond
to
something
that
was
said
about
the
federal
whistle
blower
protection
act,
that
statute
has
a
gaping
hole
in
it,
as
construed
by
the
federal
circuit,
because
the
federal
circuit
has
construed
it
to
exclude
protection
for
speech
that
is
part
of
the
employee's
normal
duties.
so,
in
any
case
that
would
come
up
with
a
federal
employee,
leaving
aside
what
judicial
remedies
are
even
available
for
a
federal
employee
in
this
area,
the
federal
employee
would
be
largely
unprotected
by
the
federal
whistle
blower
statute.
and
with
respect
to
what
the
state
of
law
is
across
the
country,
it's
complete
patchwork.
different
types
of
speech
are
protected,
there's
huge
holes
in
coverage.
there
is
no--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--that's
correct.
and
it's
sort
of
interesting
that
neither
the
petitioners,
the
united
states,
or
any
of
the
amici
have
cited
a
california
whistle
blower
statute
that
would
have
been
applicable
to
this
claim.
i,
frankly,
think
that
there
was
one
that
potentially
might
have
been
applicable,
not
cited
by
any
of
the
parties,
but
the
law
was
in
flux,
and
it
really
wasn't
all
that
clear.
and
that's...
and
california's
probably
one
of
the
better
states,
in
terms
of
whistle
blower
protections,
compared
to...
and
we're
talking
about
a
local
government
employee,
and
the
odds
of
protection...
it's
just
hit
or
miss
across
the
country.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
the--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--if
you're--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--referring
back
to
hypothetical--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
motion
to
reverse
that
was
heard
by
a
state
court
judge
was
not
run...
that
hearing
was
not
run
by
ceballos.
it
was
run
by
the
defense
lawyers
in
that
case.
and
ceballos's
testimony
was
limited
by
the
prosecution's
own
objection.
so,
you
can't
judge
anything
from
how
that
disposition
came
out,
whether
the
state
court
judge
thought
it
was...
the
police
had
lied
or
not
lied.
and
you
can't
judge
anything
by
the
way
that
hearing
was
conducted.
but
i
want
to
return
to
why
it's
so
important
that
the
court
not
shrink
first
amendment
activity
in
the
workplace.
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
public
employees,
who
internally
report
matters
of
public
concern,
enjoy
first
amendment
protection,
and
for
two
basic
reasons.
first,
the
public
needs
to
have
a
government
of
public
servants
who
do
their
jobs
honestly
and
with
integrity,
and
not
yes
men
afraid
to
tell
public
officials
the
bad
news.
a
per
se
exclusion
of
first
amendment
protection
creates
a
powerful
disincentive
for
deliberation
within
government.
the
last
time,
i
cited
an
example
of
a
fema
employee
who
was
punished
for
saying
to
a
supervisor
that
fema
wasn't
ready
to
handle
the
next
hurricane.
but
the
facts
of
this
case
are
just
as
compelling,
denying
a
first
amendment
protection
for
prosecutors
who
expose
police
misconduct.
and
his
disposition
memo
wasn't
just
a
prediction
about
whether...
how
a
judge
would
rule
on
a
motion;
he
exposed
police
misconduct
that--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--was
so--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that...
the
truth
of
that
allegation
may
be
open
to
question,
but
what
is
not
open
to
question--
ms.
bonnie

regardless
of
whether
he
was
ultimately
correct
or
not,
there's
no
question,
and
there's
no
serious
argument
here,
that
he
had
a
legitimate
basis
for
believing
that
police
misconduct
had
occurred.
he
conferred
with
his
supervisors
and
his
colleagues
before
writing
the
memo.
everyone
agreed
that
there
was
a
problem
with
the
warrant.
and
they
took
his
allegations
so
seriously
that
they
released
a
defendant
who
had--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--been--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--that's
true
of
every
public
employee
government...
excuse
me...
public
employee
speech
case,
period.
almost
all
of
these
cases
go
to
summary
judgment.
they
can't
be
dismissed
at
the
pleading
stage,
by
and
large,
because
they
require
factual
development.
so,
all
that...
all
that
this
per
se
rule
does
is
add
complexity
and
the
need
for
greater
factual
development.
it's
not
the
magic
bullet
that
the
petitioners
seem
to
think
it
is.
the
givhan
case
suggests
the
unworkability
of
drawing
the
first
amendment
line
as
what's
part
of
an
employee's
job.
conferences
between
a
teacher
and
her
principal
take
in
the
same
level
of
generality
as
writing
a
disposition
memorandum--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--no,
they
won't,
and
they
haven't.
if
the
employee...
employer
has
a
concern
about
the
manner
in
which
it's
communicated,
that
is
a
valid
employment
concern.
i
mean,
suppose
ceballos
had
gone...
had
a
big
meeting
with--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--sheriff's
department--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--embarrassing
them?
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
these...
you'd
think
that
if
there
was
that
type
of
disruption
and
hindrance
of
the
way
public
agencies
were
carrying
out
their
missions
by
these
kinds
of
cases,
which
have
been
around
for
a
long
time,
that
you'd
see
citations
to
them
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
in
the
united
states
brief.
and
their
silence
on
this
point
is
both
deafening
and
telling,
because,
in
fact,
it
has
not
been
the
problem
that
is
being
posited
here,
and
this
is
not
a
new
approach
that
we're
talking
about.
but
getting
back
to
the
givhan
case,
conferences
between
teachers
and
principals
are
a
part
of
the
teacher's
job,
and
it's
pure
formalism
to
make
the
protected
status
of
the
givhan
teacher's
speech
turn
on
whether
the
employee
manual
says
a
teacher
has
to
work
to
root
out
race
discrimination.
or
what
if
she
was
a
part
time
ombudsman
who
is
charged
to
improve
race
relations
in
the
school?
under
their
approach,
you
know,
boom,
it's
not
protected
speech
anymore,
even
though
the
underlying
first
amendment
value
is
exactly
the
same.
it
also
makes
it
completely
subject
to
manipulation
by
the
employer
in
making
everything
a
part
of
an
employer...
employee's
job,
in
terms
of
reporting
duties,
which--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--but
here's
the
problem
with
going
public.
it's
perverse
to
creating
incentive
for
employees
to
go
public,
especially
employees
in
sensitive
position...
in
a
sensitive
position.
the
first
amendment
consequences
here
are
especially
grave,
because
ceballos
had
no
realistic
alternative
channel
for
communication
open
to
him.
had
he
gone
to
a
blog,
web
site,
podcast,
and
so
on,
as
petitioners
say
in
their
reply
brief,
or
held
a
press
conference,
or
gone
to
los
angeles
times,
and
so
on,
he'd
be
fired,
and
he'd
lose
any
first
amendment
case
that
he
brought.
so,
what
avenue
does
a
prosecutor
who
wants--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--to
bring--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--well,
you
know--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--there
is
no
baseline
level
of
protection
that
is
available
by
statute
or
civil
service
protections.
if
the
court
recognizes
that
the
speech
involved
here,
exposing
government
misconduct
and
so
on,
is
important
for
first
amendment
purposes,
as
it
has
previously
recognized,
then
it's...
then
it
needs
to
be
a
baseline
level
of
first
amendment
protection.
and
then
if
whistle
blower
statutes
are
passed
that
protect
it
beyond
the
baseline
level,
that's
fine.
i'm
not
maligning
whistle
blower
statutes.
but
there
is
no
such
level
of
protection
that
is
guaranteed.
for
someone
in
his
position,
if
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
his
speech,
it's
just
not
protected.
and
i
want
to
get
back
to...
i
started
to
say
why
it's
so
important
that
the
speech
be
protected.
it's
not
just
that
the
public
needs
to
have
a
government
of
public
servants,
but
the
government
needs
to
know
how
it's
operating.
how
can
government
function
efficiently
and
effectively
if
it
does
not
possess
the
information
it
needs
to
make
responsible
choices?
when
an
employment
decision
is
actually
made
because
the
employee
has
made
a
bad
judgment
and
he
reached
an
unwarranted
conclusion
in
his
memo,
or
the
manner
in
which
he
conveyed
it
was
terribly
indiscrete,
he
publicized
in
front
of
the
whole
sheriff's
department,
and
embarrassed
them,
when
that's
an
issue,
then
the
employment
can
respond,
and
the
courts
will
make
quick...
short
shrift
of
those
cases,
as
they
do
now.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
but,
i
mean,
the
court
needs
to
appreciate
that
for
the
universe
of
public
employee
free
speech
cases,
they're
mostly
decided
at
summary
judgment;
they
aren't
decided
on
the
pleadings.
that's
already
the
case.
and
all
that
adding
a
job
duty
element
to
it
is,
adds
complexity
and
requires
more
factual
development.
it...
there's
a
number
of
issues
here.
first
of
all,
what
counts
as
part
of
an
employee's
job?
does
the
speech
have
to
be
required
by
the
job,
or
merely
related
to
the
job?
how
do
you
judge
if
the
speech
meets
the
test?
do
you
go
by
the
job
description?
common
practice?
what
if
the
employee's
speech
is
not
required
by
the
job,
but
some
independent
ethical
duty
compelled
him
to
come
forward--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--as
is
the
case
here?
and,
also,
what
if
the
employee--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--well,
it's
already
a
small
percentage
of
the
totality,
because
cases
of
this
type,
which
involve
speech
by
a
public
employee
while
they're
doing
their
job,
however
that
is
formulated,
are
already
a
small
subset
of
the
universe
of
public
employee--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--cases.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
that's
incorrect.
i
mean,
most
of
the
circuits
have
addressed
this
question,
and
virtually
all
of
them
are...
have
sided
with
the
ninth
circuit
and
has...
have
refused
to
draw
a
bright
line
rule
when
speech
has
come
up
as
part
of
the
job.
and
the...
and
as...
justice
scalia,
you
seem
to
be
referring
to
the
"as
a
citizen"
phrase
the
court
has
used
in
its
opinions.
and
i
want
to
address
that.
no
decision
by
this
court
has
ever
turned
on
the
"as
a
citizen"
phrase,
and
it's
always
been
used
in
conjunction
with
"matter
of
public
concern".
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
the
phrase
characterizes
the
facts
of
the
cases
in
which
the
court
used
it.
the
court
hasn't
addressed
whether
speech
that's
part
of
the
job--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--speech--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--speech...
and
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
it
has
no
meaning,
but
"speech
as
a
citizen"
means
speech
that
one
can
readily
imagine
a
concerned
citizen
engaging
in.
you
can
imagine
a
concerned
citizen
coming
forward
to
report
race
discrimination--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--in
a
school.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
right.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
but
if
you
look
at
the
way
it
was
used
in
pickering,
which,
of
course,
is
a
different
case...
but,
in
pickering,
the
court
was
emphasizing
that
public
employees,
like
all
citizens,
have
an
interest
in
speaking
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
the
court,
in
connick,
suggested
that
if
the
prosecutor
there
had
spoken
to
bring
to
light
actual
or
potential
wrongdoing
or
breach
of
public
trust,
her
speech
would
have
presumptively
been
protected.
if
she
had
done
that,
she'd
be
speaking
in
the
same
capacity
that
ceballos
spoke
here.
one
can
readily
imagine
a
concerned
citizen
stepping
forward
to
expose
government
misconduct.
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
sort
out
in
which
capacity
an
employee
is
speaking.
and
sometimes
an
employee
can
speak
in
more
than
one
capacity
at
once.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
it
does,
because
if
the
employer
makes
a
judgment...
as
i
said
before,
if
the
employer
makes
a
judgment
that
the
employee
has
carried
his
job
duties
poorly,
incompetently,
insubordinately,
and
so
on,
that
interest
is...
it's
either
dispositive
of
the
balance,
or
it's
nearly
so.
and
it...
so,
from
that
standpoint,
the
court
could
put
a
gloss
on
the
pickering
balance
that
explains
or
emphasizes
that
the
employer's
interests
are
controlling
how
the
jobs
are
performed,
prevails.
but
to
get
back,
for
a
moment,
to
the--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--if
that
was--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--if
that
were
really
the
case.
in
a
case
like
this,
it
would
be
clearly
pretextual,
because
not
only...
not
only
was
that
not
the
basis
that
was
actually
offered,
but
the
employer
sided
with
him
initially
and
released
the
defendant
and
said
he
had
a
legitimate
basis
for
speaking,
and
called
a
meeting
with
the
sheriff's
department,
and
took
all
these
steps
to
show
that
they
actually
sided
with
him.
and
only
when
the
sheriff's
department
accused
him
of...
as
acting
like
a
public
defender
and
said,
"we're
going
to
get
sued
if
you
don't
back
us
up.
"
then
the
office
changed
its
position
and
went
against
ceballos.
so,
in
a
case
like
this,
it
would
clearly
be
pretextual.
in
another
case,
however,
it
would
not...
presumably
there
are
cases
where
it
would
not
be
pretextual.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
well,
this
case
is
almost
identical
to
givhan.
the
only...
the
only
thing
is
that
the
court,
in
givhan,
didn't
expressly
opine
on
what
capacity
in
which
she
was
speaking.
but
it
clear
that--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--a
teacher
speaking--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--in
both
capacities--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--in--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--i
think--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
employer
had
the
same
interest
in
both
cases.
the
question
in
givhan
was
the
fact
that
it
was
an
internal
report
to
the
employer:
did
that
matter?
did
that
reduce
its
protection?
and
the
court
said
no.
so,
the
only
thing
that
it
would
take
to
make
givhan
exactly
like
this
is
to
put
it
in
the
employee
manual
or
make
her
an
ombudsman
so
it's...
so
there's
not
even
room
for
argument
that
it
was
part--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--of
her
job.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
yes,
that's--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--that's
correct.
that's
right.
let
me
turn,
just
for
a
second,
to...
getting
back
to
the
complexity
here,
and
the
linedrawing
that
has
to
be
done.
the
petitioner's
own
hypotheticals
underscore
the
arbitrariness
and
unworkability
of
their
approach.
in...
if
you
look
in
the
reply
brief,
at
page
13,
note
11,
they
cite,
as
an
example,
a
county
emergency
room
doctor
who...
and
then
they
put
"is
not
part
of
their
normal
duties.
"
to
sort
of
build
it
into
the
hypothetical...
would
have
a
right,
a
first
amendment
right,
to
come
forward
and
talk
about
inefficiencies
in
a
county
emergency
room.
whereas,
the
state
health
inspector,
who
finds
health
code
violations
in
nursing
homes
do
not.
the
first
amendment
value
in
those
situations
are
the
same.
and,
if
anything,
it's
greater
for
the
county
emergency...
for
the...
for
the...
i've
said
this
backwards...
the
county
emergency
room
doctor
who's
talking
about
how
the...
how
the
county
hospital
is
operating.
there's
no
difference
there.
and
it's
a
completely
arbitrary
linedrawing.
suppose
ceballos
had
gone
outside
the
chain
of
command,
suppose
he
had
reported
to
garcetti
that
there
was
police
misconduct.
it's
not
clear
where
that
position
would...
where
their
position
would
lead
them.
now
it's
not
part
of
his
normal
job
duty
to
go
talk
to
the
da.
he's
bypassed
the
chain
of
command.
but
it
seems
that
they
would
say
that,
"well,
because
it
was
not
part
of
his
normal
job
duty,
it...
then
it
would
be
protected.
"
and,
if
so,
what
message
is
that
sending
public
employees
about
whether
they
should
follow
their
employer's
own
rules
about
how
you
communicate
in
the
workplace
and
what
the
chain
of
command
is?
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
force
public
employees
to
go
public,
as
that
does
more
to
increase
disharmony
and
disruption
in
the
workplace
than
having
an
employee
like
ceballos,
who
followed
every
rule
and
every
order
and
instruction
regarding
how
to
handle
the
case
and
how
to
communicate
within
the
workplace.
connick
said
that
the
first
amendment's
primary
aim
is
the
full
protection
of
speech
upon
issues
of
public
concern,
as
well
as
the
practical
realities
involved
in
the
administration
of
a
government
office.
the
proposed
rule
is
inconsistent
with
that
primary
aim.
it
doesn't
do
anyone
any
good
to
have
u.s.
attorneys
and
das
blind
sided
by
coverups
in
their
office
because
their
employees
were
afraid
to
come
forward
and
tell
their
supervisors
the
bad
news.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
may
i
answer?
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
unfortunately,
there's
too
much
evidence,
there's
too
much
water
under
the
bridge,
that
shows
that
public
employees
who
deliver
bad
news,
and
are
the
unwelcome
messenger,
do
face
retaliation
in
their
workplaces.
and
here,
ceballos
told
his
workplace,
his
supervisors,
that
police
misconduct
had
occurred,
and
that
was
an
unwelcome
message,
and
he
was
retaliated
against
for
that
reason.
