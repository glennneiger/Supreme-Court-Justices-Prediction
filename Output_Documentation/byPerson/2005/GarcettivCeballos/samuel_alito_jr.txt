justice

but
if
he...
if
it's
part
of
his
job
to
speak
publicly,
then
he
has
no...
things
that
are
said
publicly
in
the
performance
of
official
responsibilities
have
no
first
amendment
protection?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so,
what
if
the
employer
tells
the
employee
to
go
out
and
lie?
there's
no
first
amendment
protection
if
the
employee,
instead,
tells
the
truth?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
it's--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--how
do
you
go
about
determining
whether
something
falls
within
somebody's
job
duties?
how
specifically
does
that
have
to
be
set
out?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
have
to
look
at--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
have
to
look
at
a
job
description?
and
does
it
have
to
be
listed
specifically
in
a
job
description?
could
there
ever
be
things
that
it's
understood
that
are
things
that
any
employee
ought
to
be
concerned
about,
such
as
very
serious
wrongdoing
within
the
office?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
isn't
there
this...
isn't
there
this
anomaly
in
the
position
that
you're
advocating?
it
would
seem
to
me
that
categories
of
employee
speech
that
are
most
likely
to
be
disruptive
would
be
public
speech
that's
outside
of
the
employee's
duties,
or
internal
speech
that
is
outside
of
the
employee's
duties.
how
much
of
a...
of
a
problem
is
it
that
employees
are
bringing
first
amendment
claims
based
on
largely
internal
speech
that
falls
within
their
own
job
duties?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
are
these
going
to
be
difficult
cases
under
pickering
balancing?
you
have
the
case
like
this,
where
the
employee,
let's
say,
says
to
the
prosecutor,
"i
think
the
case
should
be
dismissed.
"
the
prosecutor
says,
"well,
i'm
the
supervisor,
and
i
disagree.
"
"we're
not
going
to
dismiss
the
case.
"
typically,
the
employee
wouldn't
be
disciplined
for
doing
something
like
that.
now,
if
the
employee
persists
and,
you
know,
is
insubordinate,
there
would
be
another
basis
for
taking
disciplinary
action.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
is
this
going
to
lead
to
difficult
problems
in
determining
what
falls
within
the
job
duties
of
a
particular
employee?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose,
in
the
memo
here,
the
assistant
district
attorney
had
said,
"i
think
that
this
deputy
lied,
and
i
think
the
deputy
should
be
fired.
"
now,
whether
the
deputy
should
be
fired
or
not
probably
isn't
within
the
job
duties
of
this...
of
this
employee.
so,
would
that
be
outside
of
your
rule?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
about
the
cases...
putting
aside
the
clear
cut
case
where
the
employee's
statement
is
either
clearly
correct
or
clearly
incorrect,
but
what
about
the
case
where
the
objection
to
what
the
employee
is
doing
is
the
manner
of
the
speech?
it's
on
the
matter...
it's
on
the
matter
of
concern,
but
the
supervisor
just
thinks
that
it's
being
handled
in
a
way
that's
ham
handed
or
indiscrete.
aren't
they
going
to...
aren't
these
cases
going
to
cause
terrible
litigation
problems?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
under--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--then
under
pickering--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
test
is
going
to
be
whether
the
manner,
which
may
be
difficult
to
recreate,
caused...
how
much
of
a
disruption
it
caused
to
the
operations
of
the
office.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--it--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
pickering--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
pickering
balancing
is
done,
is
there
anything
special
about
the
situation
where
the
employee's
speech
is
part
of
the
employee's
job
duties?
is
the
test
applied
differently
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
that
answer.
so,
in
this
situation,
if
the
employer
said
that
mr.
ceballos
was
performing
his
job
poorly,
that
would
be
enough
to
tip
the
balance
in
the
employer's
favor--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--under
pickering
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so,
basically,
the
test...
the
pickering
balancing
is
the
same
in
this
situation
as
it
is
in,
let's
say,
the
givhan
situation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
for
that
reason,
they're...
for
that
reason,
they're
not
likely
to...
in
most
instances,
they
would
not
be
hostile
to
receiving
that
kind
of
information,
if
it
was
provided
to
them.
