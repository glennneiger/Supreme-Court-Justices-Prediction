mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
much
of
the
work
of
public
employees
is
performed
by
speaking
or
writing,
and
much
of
that
work
concerns
matters
of
public
interest.
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
public
employees
engaged
in
such
work
have
at
least
a
presumptive
first
amendment
right
to
perform
their
jobs
as
they
see
fit.
that
conclusion
rests
on
a
fundamentally
mistaken
view
of
the
first
amendment.
when
the
government
pays
for
somebody
to
do
its
work,
it
has
an
absolute
right
to
control
and
direct
the
manner
in
which
that
work
is
performed.
that
is
a
basic
rule
of
agency
law,
and
insofar
as
federal
employees
are
concerned,
it's
a
basic
rule
of
our
constitutional
structure.
article
ii
of
the
constitution
gives
the
president
the
power
and
responsibility
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed.
effectuation
of
that
power,
and
effectuation
of
the
principle
of
accountability
that
it
embodies,
requires
that
supervisors
in
the
executive
branch
be
able
to
control
and
direct
the
work
of
their
subordinates.
the
first
amendment,
which
was
adopted
just
a
few
years
after
the
constitution,
was
not
meant
to
interpose
the
first
amendment
in
that
relationship
between
supervisor
and
subordinate
or
otherwise
to
regulate
the
internal
affairs
of
the
executive
branch.
that
is
the
function
of
civil
service
laws
adopted
by
the
legislature
and
internal
executive
branch
directives
taking
into
account
the
relative
costs
and
benefits
of
certain
types
of
regulation.
and
finally--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
would,
no
doubt,
be
other
restrictions.
justice
kennedy
mentioned
ethical
rules.
under
the
federal
whistle
blower
statute--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
would--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--be
a
restriction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
first
amendment
would
not
be
the...
would
not
be
the
source
of
protection.
whether
there
would
be
some
argument
that,
if
the
employee
could
not
be
fired,
it
would
be
an
unconstitutional
condition
to
require
him
to
put
his
job
at
peril
for
committing
a
due
process
violation
or
something
like
that,
whether
there
would
be
a
claim
like
that,
that
would
be
a
different
matter.
but
the
first
amendment--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
the
first
amendment
does
not
address
speech
that
an
employee
undertakes
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
no,
i
was
just
suggesting
there
would
have
to
be
some
unconstitutional
condition.
well,
the
due
process--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--my
point
is
that
the
due
process...
due
process
clause
does
address
the
conduct
at
question,
which
is
the
requirement
that
exculpatory
material
be
turned
over
to
the
defendant.
and
so,
the
question
is
that
the
employee
would
be
put
in
a
position
where
he
would...
where
he
would
be
instructed
not
to
perform
what
he
understood
to
be
a
constitutional
violation.
i
think
most
civil
service
laws,
most
ethical
rules,
would
take
care
of
it.
and,
as
i
mentioned,
the
federal
whistle
blower
statute,
in
2302(b)(9),
i
think
it
is,
has
a
provision
that
protects
employees
who
refuse--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
obey
an
order--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
there
would
be...
there
would
be
those
sorts
of
restrictions.
my
only
point
is
that
the
first
amendment
is
not
addressed
to
speech
or
writing
that
an
employee
undertakes
in
the...
in
the...
in
the
course
of
his
official
duties.
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that
would
be
a
huge
problem,
because
it
would
effectively
constitutionalize
the
day
to
day
interactions
between
supervisors
and
subordinates
within
the
government,
and
put
the
federal
courts
in
charge
of
overseeing
that.
even
if
these
cases
might
ultimately
be
disposed
of
on
summary
judgment,
there
would
be
discovery,
there
would
be
the
burdens
of
the
litigation.
and
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the...
where
the
government
is
taking
the
position
that
the...
these
actions
were
not
even
taken
against
the
employee
because
of
this
disposition
memorandum...
they
say
they
had
perfectly
valid
other
reasons...
but
this
case
exemplifies
what
the
problem
would
be,
is
that
the
employee
could
identify
something
that
he
said
or
did
in
the
course
of
his
duties
that
involved
speech
and
say,
"that's
the
reason
that
i
was
disciplined.
"
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
in
this
case,
if
we
look
at
what
the
ninth
circuit
said,
for
example,
when
it
got
to
step
two,
it
said
that
the
employee
could
only
be
disciplined
if
the...
if
the
agency
could
show
that
there
was
disruption
or
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth.
but
when
somebody
is
actually
carrying
out
his
job
duties...
not
engaged
in
outside
activities
that
may
reflect
back
and
be
disruptive,
but
engaged
in
the
job
duties
themselves,
the
employer
has
a
right
to
insist
on
more
than
that
the
employee
not
be
disruptive
or
reckless;
he
has
a
right
to
insist
that...
the
employer
has
a
right
to
insist
that
the
employee
affirmatively
contribute
to
the
work
of
the
office
and
exercise
good
judgment.
and
the...
and
the
supervisor
has
to
be
in
a
position
to
make
judgments
about
whether
that
judgment
was
good
or
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it...
i
don't
think
it
will,
and
certainly
no
more
problems
than
the...
than
this
court
has
wrestled
with,
and
the
lower
courts
have,
in
terms
of
what's
a
matter
of
public
concern.
i
think
it's
a
common
inquiry
to
determine
what
a
person's
job
duties
are.
and
i
think
it's
a
very
important
place
to
have
a
clear
line,
just
as
there
is
a
clear
line
with
respect
to
matters
of
public
concern.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
it
would
probably
be
inside
the
rule.
i
think...
i
would
think,
particularly
for
a...
for
an
assistant
da
to
make
a
recommendation
about
the
consequences
of
illegal
conduct
would
be
within
his...
within
his
job
duties.
i
also
want
to
say
that
this
court's
decision
in
pickering,
and
in
that
line
of
cases,
i
think,
fully
support
this,
because,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
connick,
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
the
protection
afforded
by
pickering
is
for
action
taken
as
a
citizen
on
matters
of
public
concern.
that
"as
a
citizen"
phrase
was
reiterated
in
virtually
all
of
this
court's
cases
in
the
area.
and
the
underlying
principle
is
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
yes,
it
does.
but
all
the
court
addressed
in
givhan
was
the
question
of
whether,
if
you
take
your
concerns
not
publicly
to
the
newspaper,
but
express
them
to
the...
in
that
case,
the
principal,
that
you
don't
lose
first
amendment
protection.
but
the
court
did
not
address
the
question
of
whether
those
comments
were
within
the
scope
of
the
employee's
duties.
and
i
think
a
reading
of
lower
court's
decision
in
givhan
indicates
that
they
were
not.
she
was
an
english
teacher,
and
she
was
commenting
to
the
principal
about
employment
practices
at
the
school.
that
would
not
have
been
within
the
scope
of
her
employment.
and
then--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
might
be...
it
might
be
closer
to
that,
yes.
i
think,
again,
it
would
depend
if
she
was...
if
she
was
vice
principal
for
administration
or
something,
i
think...
i
think
it
clearly
would.
but
the
purpose
of
the
pickering
line
of
cases
is
to
protect
employees
when
they
go
outside
of
their...
of
their
job,
that
they
shouldn't
be
penalized
for
having
taken
a
job
to
be
able
to
participate
in
public
affairs,
as
the
court
put
it
in
pickering.
that
does
not
suggest
that
the...
that
the
employee
brings
the
first
amendment
into
the
job
workplace
and
can
use
it
as
a
shield
or
a
sword
in
the
day
to
day
interactions
with
his
supervisors,
and
to
do
so
would
be
constitutionalize,
as
i
said,
the
day
to
day
operations
of
employment.
and
this
is
a
classic
example,
where
somebody
wrote
a
disposition
memorandum
in
the
course
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
the
course
of
those
activities.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
it's
made
publicly
in
the
capacity
as
a
citizen,
assuming
the
public...
it
isn't
a
speech
that
he's
making
in
the
course
of
his
duties...
if
he
writes
something
to
the
press,
he's
speaking
in
his
capacity
as
a
citizen.
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
would
be
constitutionally
protected;
it
simply
means
that
you
get
to
step
two
of
the
pickering
balancing,
because
he's
not
carrying--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--out
the
job
duties.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that...
at
least
not
if
it's
part
of
his
job
duties.
and
i
would
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--ordinarily
in
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
mean--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--two
things
about
that.
when
he's
saying
it
internally,
he's
doing
his
job.
when
he's
going
externally,
he
may
be
violating
office
policies.
