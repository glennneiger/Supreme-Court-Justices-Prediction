but
in
rust
v.
sullivan,
the
government
was
buying
a
commodity.
it
was
the
government's
program,
and
it
was
employing
people,
funding
people
to
implement
that
program.
here
is
a
person
whose
job
includes
being
candid,
serving
justice,
serving
truth.
if
that's
part
of
his
job
responsibilities,
that's
quite
different
from
speaking
the
speech
that
the
government
wants
spoken.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
lee,
is
your
position
that
job
required
speech...
an
assistant
district
attorney's
obligation
is
to
give
his
best
opinion...
that
job
required
speech
is
outside
the
first
amendment
protection?
you
say
the
ninth
circuit
went
too
far,
in
one
way.
but
are
you
saying
that
as
long
as
it's
related
to
his
job,
it's
simply
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
is
that
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
understand--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
understand
that,
but
i
was
confused
by
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
because
the
question
was,
would
this
come
out
a
different
way
under
pickering?
and
i
take
it
your
answer
is,
this
doesn't
come
in
the
door,
because
he's
not
speaking
as
a
citizen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
confused.
you
think
that
this...
there
was
an
aspect
of
it
that
was
citizen
speech?
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
what
do
you
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--by
"the
balance,
weigh
in
favor?
"
because,
a
moment
ago,
i
thought
you
answered
me,
"this
kind
of
speech
simply
is
not
shielded
by
the--
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--"#
first
amendment".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
hearing
at
which
this
office
had
testified?
i
thought
that
part
of
the
complaint
was,
"when
i
spoke
at
the
hearing,
i
was
speaking
in
a
public
forum,
and
they
fired
me
for
it.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
lee...
ms.
lee
told
us
that
the
ninth
circuit
weighed
the
capacity
of
the
plaintiff
as
an
employee,
rather
than
a
member
of
the
public,
in
favor
of
the
employee
and
against
the
employer.
is
that
how
you
read
the
ninth
circuit's
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
be
something
that
would
have
to
go
to
trial,
to
prove
that
the...
that
the
employee
was
incompetent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
he
would
be
violating
the
internal
rules
of
the
workplace.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
it's
giving
his
candid
views...
the
search
warrant...
he's
giving
his
own
opinion.
but
if
he
goes
outside,
he
is
violating
a
rule
of
the
workplace.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
are
certainly
measures
to
be
taken
against
him
for
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
connick
was
about,
that
there
are
things
that
are
said
in
the
workplace
that
are
of
no
public
interest.
they're
personal
gripes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you...
it
wouldn't
be
that
way
if
the
rule
was
that
if
it's
employee
speech
on
the
job,
it's
not
protected
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
that's
the
argument
that's
being
made
here
by
both
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
one
aspect
of
this
case
that
no
one
has
touched
on.
the
concurring
judge,
judge
o'scannlain,
said,
this
is
what
whistleblower
statutes
are
supposed
to
handle,
and
that
if
we
accepted
your
view
of
the
first
amendment
coverage,
the
whistleblower
statutes
would
be
superfluous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
california
does
have
a
whistleblower
statute.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
was
a
claim
made
under
it,
but
we're
not
told
how
it
came
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
did...
he--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--some
are
quite
narrow--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
#
of
what
they
cover.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--some
of
the
whistleblower
statutes
are
very
specific
and
narrow--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
what
they
cover.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
is
the
california
remedy?
let's
say
his
boss
says,
"don't
turn
over
brady
materials".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about...
you
were
talking
about
public
speaking.
there
was,
as
i
remember,
a
talk
that
was
given
to
the
mexican
american
bar
association,
and
that
was
not
something
that
his
employer
required
him
to
do,
but
he--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
would
have
a
1983
case
if
he
were
disciplined
or
disadvantaged
in
the
workplace
because
of
the
talk
that
he
gave
to
the
mexican
american
bar
association
in
which
he
criticized
da
office
policies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
she
was
the
vice
principal,
that
would
be...
then
it
would
come--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--within
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
california,
which
was
the
state
where
this
episode
occurred?
was...
i
think
you
mentioned
that
he
did
not
make
a
claim
under
the
state
statute.
