ms.
cindy
s.
lee
chief
justice
roberts,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
first
amendment
requires
protection
for
all
public
employee
speech
that
touches
on
a
matter
of
public
concern
without
any
consideration
of
whether
the
speech
was
expressed
as
a
citizen.
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
affords
no
consideration
for
the
role
of
the
speaker
as
a
citizen
or
an
employee
at
the
time
of
the
speech.
this
approach,
however,
plants
a
seed
of
a
constitutional
claim
in
virtually
every
speech
that
public
employees
express
while
carrying
out
their
regular
job
duties.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
did
not
apply
the
pickering
test
when
they
were
doing
the
initial
analysis,
a
threshold
analysis,
of
whether
or
not
the
speech
at
issue
was
constitutionally
protected.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
not
necessarily,
not
the
way
the
ninth--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--circuit
viewed
it.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
in
the
ninth
circuit's
view,
the
capacity
of
an
employee
at
the
time
of
the
speech
is
of
some
factor.
it's
a
determinative
factor.
but,
in
its
view,
it
was
a
factor
that
should
be
weighed
against
finding
no
constitutional
protection.
in
its
view--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--our
view
is
that--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--if
the
application
of
the
pickering
is
re
articulated
such
that
when
job
required
speech
is
at
issue,
like
in
this
case,
the
employer
should
invariably
win
or
have
a...
an
easier
time
of
prevailing.
but,
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
see
it
that
way.
the
ninth
circuit
took
the
view
that
the
capacity
of
an
employee
at
the
time
of
the
speech
is
a
factor,
but
it
would
be
difficult
for
an
employer
to
justify
employment
decisions
made
when
the
employee
is
speaking
as
required
by
the
duties
of
employment.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
our
view
is
that
if
we
accept
the
ninth
circuit's
approach,
then
speech
by
public
employees
expressed
while
carrying
out
their
assigned
job
duties
would
virtually...
invariably
be--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--a
matter--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--not
necessarily.
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
other
circuits
that
have
made,
primarily,
content
the
determinative
factor
in
finding
presumptive
first
amendment
protection
have,
in
some
regards,
considered
the
capacity
of
an
employee
as
whether
or
not
the
speech
should
be
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
but
they've
done
so
in
the
context
of
whether
or
not
it
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
so,
the
ninth
circuit
is
alone
in
having
addressed
squarely
whether
or
not
job
required
speech
should
not
be
afforded
presumptive
first
amendment
protection.
the
other--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--that's
correct.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
it
would
be
our
view
that
if
the
assigned
job
duties
of
that
university
professor
was
to
speak
on
a
particular
topic
or
content,
and
they
were
getting
paid
for
doing
that,
that
that
is
a
job
required
%
speech
and
that
it
should
not
be
entitled,
presumptively,
%
to
first
amendment
protection.
now,
that
is
a
far
cry
from--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--our--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
according
to
the
ninth
circuit's
view,
anything...
anytime
a
public
employee
speaks,
and
that
speech
relates
to
a
matter
of
public
concern,
that
is
presumptively
entitled
to
first
amendment
protection,
such
that
the
burden
is
on
the
employer
to
justify
the
decisions
for
the
employment
actions
taken.
our
view
is
that
the
employer
should
not
have
that
burden
until
the
first
threshold
is
made,
that
the
speech
is
expressed
as
a
citizen
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
our
approach
would
not
prohibit
that--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--kind
of--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that's
correct.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that's
correct.
the
ninth--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--in
essence,
the
principle
of
our
approach
is
supported
by
those
government
subsidizer
cases,
like
the
rust
v.
sullivan.
our--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
in
this
case,
we
think
that
the
job
duties
are
aligned
with
those
subsidizer
cases.
we
have
a
deputy
district
attorney
whose
job
duty
was
to
assess
the
merits
of
the
prosecution's
case,
which
he
did.
that
includes
assessing
the
credibility
of
a
witness.
because
his
conclusions
in
this
case
were
that
the
prosecution's
witness
was
not
very
credible
does
not
make
that
task
extraordinary.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that
could
be
a--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--legitimate
reason.
or--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--or
the
employer
doesn't--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--necessarily
have
to--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--our
position
is
that
the
speech
was
inaccurate
and
that--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
we
have
the...
the
deputy
district
attorney's
disposition
memorandum
assessed
that...
in
his
view,
that
the
prosecution
was
going
to
lose
on
the
pending
motion
to
dismiss,
in...
on
the
grounds
of
that
the
search
warrant
was
going
to
be...
was
going
to
be
found
invalid.
that
was
the
essence
of
the
deputy
district
attorney's
assessment.
and
in
his
memorandum,
as
part
of
his
prosecutorial
duties,
he
evaluated
that.
he
told
his
supervisor,
"look,
you
know,
i'm
looking
at
the
credibility
of
the
officer.
"
"i
conducted
an
investigation.
"
"i
don't
think
we're
going
to
win
on
this
case.
"
the
supervisor
initially
thought,
"okay,
you
have
a
point.
"
but
ultimately
decided,
"you
know
what?
"
"i'm
not
as
sure
as
you
are.
"
"we
have
a
motion
to
traverse
on
calendar,
where
we
have
a
judge
who's
going
to
be
assessing
that,
so
let's
see
what
happens.
"
that
judge
found
that
the
search
warrant
was
valid.
and
so,
in
essence,
we
have
a
public
employee
who
is
challenging
employment
decisions
made
by
his
supervisors--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--that--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--it
is
not
our--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--position--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--justice
souter,
it
is
not
our
position,
and
we
have
never
taken
the
stance,
that
the
deputy
district
attorney
in
this
case
was
reckless
in
regards
of
his
speech--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--or
his
evaluation.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
our
view
is
that--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--correct.
what--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--we
do
know
is
that
the...
it
is
our
view
that
the
supervisor...
while
the
supervisor
contended
that
he
did
not
react
to
this
speech
adversely,
that
he
could
have.
we
have
here
speech
that
was
required
by
the
job.
the
employee
here...
if
we
take
the
ninth
circuit's
approach,
we
would
be
providing
public
employees
a
constitutional
right
to
perform
their
assigned
job
required
duties
in
a
way
that
is
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
public
employer.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
the
internal
grievance
procedure
resulted
in
the
finding
that
the
supervisors
did
not
retaliate
against
the
deputy
district
attorney
for
the...
for
his
job
required
duties.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that's
correct--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--justice
stevens.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
we
assume,
for
purposes
of
the
summary
judgment
motion,
that
he
was
within
his
prosecutorial
duties
in
making
those
assessments.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
no,
our
position
has
never
been
that
the
supervisors
took
any
retaliatory
action
as
a
result
of
his
speech.
he
was
not
fired.
what
the--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--deputy
district
attorney--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--challenges
here
is
various
employment
decisions
by
his
supervisor,
claiming
that
they
were
in
retaliation
for
him
having
prepared
and
communicated
a
disposition
memorandum
that
was
within
the
course
and
scope
of
his
employment
duties.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
our--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--our
position
has
been
that
the
employer
could
certainly
have
reacted,
or
responded,
to
the
speech
or
the
way
he
conducted
his
job,
or
performed
his
job,
but
they
didn't,
in
this
case.
there
were...
there
were
legitimate
business
reasons
for
the
employment--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--decisions
made.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that's
correct--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--justice
scalia.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that's--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--that's
correct.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
and
the
problem
with
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
is
that
every
time
there
is
job
performance
at
issue
that's
required
by
the
public
employee,
it
essentially
puts
the
question
before
a
jury
or
a
federal
court
to
assess
the
motives--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--to
assess
the
reasonableness
of
the
decisions
made.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
our
view
is
that
job
required
speech
is
not
of
a
character
for
which
principles
of
first
amendment
should
protect.
in
pickering,
the
public
school
teacher
sought
to
be
treated
as
a
member
of
the
general
public
when
he
sent
his
letter
to
the
newspaper
criticizing
the
allocation
of
financial
resources
by
the
school
board.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
nothing
like
that
arises--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--under
the
current...
my...
under
my
current
understanding
of
the
pickering
balancing...
which
is...
shifts
the
burden
to
the
employer
to
justify
the
employment
decisions
made...
that
we
don't...
i
don't
necessarily
believe
that
the
pickering
would
clearly
weigh
in
favor
of
the
employer
in
this
case,
even
though
the
speech
was
so
connected
to
the
duties
of
employment--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--no.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
we
contend
that
it
should...
in
situations
where
the
speech
at
issue
is
job
required,
and
that
employee
is
getting
paid
for
engaging
in
that
kind
of
duty,
that
the
balance
should
weigh
in
favor
of
the
employer.
and
i
believe
the
respondent--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--concedes
as
much.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that's
correct.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
our...
the...
our
view
is
that
job
required
speech
should
not
be
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
so
there
is
no
need
to
go
into
the
balancing,
there
is
no
need
to
go
into
the
weighing
of
the
interests
of
the
employer
versus
the
interest
of
the
employee.
the
balancing
has
been
required
in
the...
in
the
line
of
cases
that
the
court
has
held...
the
language
that
the
court
has
used
in
this
first
amendment
public
employment
context
is,
when
you
do
the
balancing,
you
weigh
the
interests
of
the
state,
as
an
employer,
versus
the
interests
of
the
employee,
as
a
citizen,
when
engaging
in
this
speech.
our
view
is
that
the
balancing
should
only
be
required
when
the--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--public
employee--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--i'm
sorry,
could
you
repeat
that?
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
i
believe
the
court's
referring
to
facts
similar
to
givhan,
where
there
you
had
speech
made
privately
to
a
supervisor,
and--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--this
court--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--this
court
has
found
that
it
was
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
however,
the
court
did
not
need
to
address
the
role
of
the
speaker
in
that
case,
because
there
you
had
an
english
teacher
who
was
criticizing
the
racial--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--policies--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--it
could
be
in
this
case,
where
the
prosecutor,
who
is
assigned,
or
authorized,
to
speak
on
behalf
of
the
da's
office
in
a
pending
criminal
action,
made
comments
to
the
press
about
the
nature
of
the
case,
but,
rather...
and,
in
this
particular
scenario,
goes
too
far,
goes
beyond
what
the
da's
office
allowed
him
to
speak
on.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
he
could--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--certainly
be
discharged
for
that.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
the...
under
our
approach,
the
issue
is
not
whether
it's
privately
or
publicly.
if
the
job
requires
him
to
speak
in
a...
within
the
internal
channels,
then
that
speech...
he's
doing
his
job,
he's
getting
paid
for
it,
and
he
should
not
be
entitled
to
first
amendment
protection.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--i'd
like
to--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--brady
disclosures
are
the
obligations
of
the
district
attorney's
office.
so,
in
this
case,
when
the
deputy
district
attorney
believed
that
it
should
be
disclosed,
his
supervisor
had
an
absolute
right
to,
say,
on
behalf
of
the
da's
office,
challenge
that
decision
to
disclose.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
those
ethical
obligations
would
build...
would
arise
from
his
capacity
as
a
prosecutor.
prosecutors
are
employees.
governmental
employees
have
a
general
standard
of
ethical
conduct.
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
getting
paid
for
the
same
assigned
job
duties.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
it's
our
view
that
he
does
not.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
under
our
approach,
we
believe
that
many
cases
won't
even
be
filed,
because
they
won't
be
able
to
make
a
colorable
claim
that
it
is
citizen
speech.
this
case,
in
its
essence,
is
about
whether
a
public
employee
has
a
constitutional
right
to
perform
his
assigned
job
duties
in
such
a
way
that
is
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
employer.
in
pickering
and
in
connick,
this
court
contemplated
first
amendment
litigation
in
a
public
employment
context
in
the
relatively
rare
circumstances
in
which
adverse
employment
action
was
taken
as
a
result
of
an
employee's
extracurricular
activities.
under
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
respondent's
approach,
the
exception
would
become
the
rule.
it
is
our
view
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
simply
gone
too
far
in
giving
a
broad
sweep
for
first
amendment
protection
for
any
public
employee
speech,
simply
because
it
happens
to
be
a
matter
of
public
concern.
as
judge
o'scannlain
stated
in
his
special
concurring
opinion,
"the
time
is
right
for
this
court
to
steer
the
drifting
first
amendment
jurisprudence
back
to
its
proper
moorings.
"
thank
you.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
its
core,
the
first
amendment
is
about
free
and
open
debate
on
matters
of
public
importance.
it's
about
citizens'
rights
to
participate
in
public
debate
and
contribute
their
personal
opinions
and
views
whether
they
are
mainstream
or
not.
the
first
amendment
is
not,
however,
about
policing
the
workplace.
it
is
not
about
constitutionalizing
the
law
of
public
employment.
nor
should
it
be.
yet,
if
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
is
accepted
or
adopted,
this
is
what
it
will
do.
in
this
section
1983
action,
a
deputy
district
attorney
prepared
a
disposition
memorandum,
pursuant
to
his
prosecutorial
duties,
setting
forth
the
reasons
why,
in
his
prosecutorial
judgment,
the
criminal
case
that
he
was
supervising
was
likely
to
be
dismissed.
the
fact
that
the
supervisor
did
not
agree
with
the
content
of
that
memorandum
should
not
give
the
plaintiff
a
constitutional
right
to
challenge
adverse
employment
decisions
that
he
claims
were
in
response
to
the
product
of
that
memorandum.
there
are
no
first
amendment
interests
that
are
served
when
public
employees
are
allowed
to
perform
assigned
job
duties
in
such
a
way
as
to
the
disagreement
of
the
public
employer.
essentially,
what
the--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--ninth
circuit--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--when--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
it's
our
position
that
when
speech
by
public
employees
cannot
fairly
be
said
to
be
speech
as
a
citizen,
then
the
government
should
have
a
presumptive
right
to
manage
its
personnel
affairs
and
internal--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
there's
on
core
first
amendment
values
that
are
furthered
when
public
employers
have
to
justify
employment
decisions
that
they
make
on
a
routine
basis.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
the
difference
in
connick
is
that
the
employee...
the
prosecutor
in
that
actions
spoke
more
closely
with
a
citizen,
and
the
government--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--had--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
if
the
employee
is
required
to
investigate
or
report
that
kind
of
conduct
pursuant
to
their
normal
duties
of
employment,
then
that
is
speech
that
the
employer
should
absolutely
or
presumptively
have
an
ability
to
monitor.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that's--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--absolutely
right.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that's
correct.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
if
it's
not
part
of...
if
it's...
if
it's
not
part
of
your
core
job
duties
that
you...
that
employers
should
evaluate.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
our
position
is,
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
made
an
accurate
statement
during
the
performance
of
his
job...
so,
in
other
words,
if
his
disposition
memorandum...
if
the
employer
accepted
it
and
agreed
with
it,
and
the
case
didn't
go
any
further,
there
wouldn't
be
a
basis
of
first
amendment,
because
normally
he
is
acting
pursuant
to
his
job
duties
and
it's
up
to
the
employer
to
evaluate
whether
or
not
he's
adequately
performing
those
job--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--duties.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
right.
it--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--should
not
be
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that's
not
to
say
that
the
public
employer
is
free
from
being
challenged
with
regards
to
the
employment
decision.
it
may
be
a
matter
for
the
employee
to
seek,
through
the
grievance
procedure,
that...
like
mr.
ceballos
did
initially,
or
even
pursue
it
to
civil
service
remedies.
and
those
are
the
type
of
decisions
that
the
personnel
in
those
departments
are
more
ably,
i
think,
to
decide.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
if
his
job--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--is
not...
if
that
speech
was
not
required
to
be
kept--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--internally.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
in
our
view,
no.
if
it's
a
job...
if
the
public
employee's
assigned
job
duties
is
to,
on
behalf
of
the
government
or
the
employer,
speak
to
the
public
about
certain
things
that
are
going
on
in
the
office,
and
he
happens
to
get
disciplined
for
it,
that
wouldn't
pass
our
step.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
i
don't
know
if
that's
a...
if
that's
a
detailed
enough
hypothetical.
i
mean,
if
the
employee's
core
job
duties
are
to
report
x,
y,
and
z,
and
that
employee
goes
out
to
the
public
and
reports
x,
y,
z,
e,
and
f--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--i
think
that's--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
the
question
would
be
if
he's--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
i
think
the
plaintiff
could
argue
that,
"that's
not
my
core
job
duties.
"
"my
job
duties
is
to.
"
--if
it's
a
prosecutor,
"is
to
make
statements"--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--"#
pursuant
to"--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--absolutely--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--not.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
that
would
be
the
required
assignments
of
his
job.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
that
would
be
an
issue
of
fact.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
they
do.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
and
the
employer
goes
ahead
and
turns
it
over?
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
if
the
boss
makes
a
determination
that,
"this
is
not
brady
materials.
"
"i
don't
want
disclosed.
"
and
the
employee
goes
ahead
and
discloses
it,
our
position
is,
that
would
not
be
protected
first
amendment
speech.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
no,
it
wasn't.
and
it's
not
part
of
this
lawsuit,
because
there's
no
dispute
that
the
communication
at
issue
in
this
case
is
that
disposition
memorandum
that
he
prepared
purely
pursuant
to
his
prosecutorial
duties.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
then
our
position
is,
it
gets
past
step
one,
because
it's
not
normally
something
that
a
prosecutor
is
required
to
do,
and
it
would
be
subject
to
a
balancing--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--correct.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
it
was
initially
alleged,
but,
through
the
course
of
discovery,
the
focus
of
it
was
a
disposition
memorandum,
because
by
the
time
he
went
to
the
mexican
american
bar
association,
he
had
already
been
disciplined,
so
there
is
no
causation
between
his
public
speech
to
the
mexican
bar
association
and
the
disciplinary
actions
that
were--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--are
at
issue.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
in--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--in
essence,
he
did,
when
we--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--when
we
went
to
the
summary
judgment
motion.
and
that's
why
the
district
court
was
very
clear
that
the
issue--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--in
this
case
was
the
communication
in
the
disposition
memorandum.
and
that
was...
it
was
undisputed
that
that
was
purely
pursuant
to
his
prosecutorial
duties--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--and--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--correct.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
in...
to
the
extent
that
he's
alleging
that
if
that's...
"i
went
to
the
mexican
american
bar
association,
and
i
alleged...
or
i
made
statements
that
there
were
some
improprieties
in
the
district
attorney's
office.
"
that
would
probably
get
past
step
one
and
the
matter
of
public
concern,
and
then
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
his
interest
in
speaking
as
a
citizen
outweighed
the
interests
of
the
government.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
i
think
what
your
honor
is
really
asking
is,
if
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
had
taken
his
disposition
memorandum,
and,
rather
than
give
it
to
his
supervisor,
which
what
he...
what
he
was
required
to
do,
he
went
to
the
public
and
gave
it
to
them
on
a
pending
case,
i
don't
necessarily
think
that
would
be
protected
under
pickering,
as
well.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
well,
he
certainly--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--wouldn't
be
speaking
in
his
capacity
as
a
prosecutor,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
his
interests
would
be
outweighed
by
the
employer's
interest.
in--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--and--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
in--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--in
some
respects,
if
you're
talking
about
job
required
speech
that
you
are...
part
of
those
duties,
and
the
function,
is
to
keep
it
internally
until
at
least
there's
some
decision
by
the
supervisor,
and,
rather
than
do
that,
you
send
it
to
the
press
or
leak
that
information
out,
i
think
a
governmental
disruption
in
efficiency
can
be
presumed
there.
so,
i
don't
think
it's
as...
i
don't
think
it's
as
clear
that
that...
that
mr.
ceballos
would
have
ultimately
prevailed
under
the
balancing.
i
mean,
if
he
had
taken
the--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--the
speech
externally,
i
think
there...
that
he
ultimately
would
have
lost,
as
well--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--because
there
is--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--and
ultimately
the
result
would
be,
there's
no
protected--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--first
amendment
speech.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
if
it's
a
function
of
the
person's
job...
assigned
job
duties.
so,
the...
you
look
at
the
speech
at
issue.
and
here
is...
it's
a
disposition
memorandum
that
was
purely
pursuant
to
what
the...
what
his
duties
required.
he's...
it's
normally
a
function
that
the
employer
would
take
into
consideration
for
things
like
promotions--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--or
demotions.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
i
mean,
there
could
be
situations
where
there's
a
general
code
of
conduct
by
all
employees;
you
know,
employees
who
feel
that
they've
been,
you
know,
harassed,
sexually
harassed,
or
feel
that
others
are,
should
report
that.
but
that
may
not
be
that
person's
assigned
job
duties.
in
other
words,
that
person
is
not
assigned
to
investigate
and
report
those
type
of
things.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
and--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
it
would
be
assigned
job
duties,
things
that
normally
the
employer
would
take
into
consideration
for
things
like
terminating
or
promoting.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
an
important
point,
justice
alito.
i
mean,
in
this
case,
it's
exactly
what
happened.
the
supervisors
took
mr.
ceballos's
assessment
seriously.
and
the
difference
was,
after
they
further
thought
about
it,
they
didn't
think...
they
didn't
agree
with
the
proper
course
of
action
for
the
district
attorney's
office,
especially
since
there
was
a
motion
pending,
"let's
let
the
courts
decide
that.
"
so,
if...
where...
i
think
plaintiff's
suggesting
that,
but
for
protecting
speech
that's
required
by
the
duties
of
employment,
employees
really
would
not
have
much
of
a
right
or
a
remedy
if
it
turns
out
that
the
employer
believed
that
maybe
they
weren't
performing
their
jobs
correctly,
or,
in
our
case,
if
the
supervisor
had
considered
the
speech
and
said,
"you
know
what?
"
"you
made
a
bad
judgment
call,
and
we
don't
think
it's
entitled
to
a
promotion.
"
that
shouldn't
give
the
plaintiff
a
constitutional
right
to
challenge
that
decision.
if
that...
if
the...
if
mr.
ceballos
was,
in
fact,
doing
his
job,
that
was
required
of
his
job,
and
he
was
doing
it
competently,
his
remedy
is
not
the
first
amendment.
his
remedy
is
not
even...
he
doesn't
even
need
a
whistle
blower
statute
for
that.
he
could
go
through
civil
service,
he
could
go
through
a
formal
grievance
procedure,
and
though...
although
state
statutes
on
whistle
blowers
do
vary,
there
is
no
state
statute,
in
my
understanding,
that
covers
broadly
than
what
the
ninth
circuit
does
here--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--which
is--
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
--well,
the
reason
that
job
required
speech
may
not
be...
may
not
be
filed,
or
basis
for
first
amendment
retaliation,
or
the
reason
why
we
may
not
have
seen
that,
may
simply
be
because
public
employees
understandably
do
not
believe
they're
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights
when
they
are
simply
performing
their
duties
of
employment,
when
they're
speaking
pursuant
to
their
job
duties
or
writing
reports
or
memorandums
pursuant
to
their
job
duties.
just
because
there
may
not
be
the
significant
increase
of
first
amendment
litigation
in
the
public
employment
context
for
purely
job
required
speech
does
not
mean
that
this
court
should
not
consider
this
issue.
and
i
disagree
with
the
representation
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
identical
to
givhan.
this
court
commented
in
that
decision
that
givhan
was
citizen
speech.
and
i
don't
necessarily
think
that...
and
it...
what...
that...
where
our
proposal...
our
approach
would
add
further
complexity
to
first
amendment
litigation
in
an
employment
context.
it's
certainly
not
a
difficult
decision...
analysis
in
this
case.
ms.
cindy
s.
lee
thank
you.
