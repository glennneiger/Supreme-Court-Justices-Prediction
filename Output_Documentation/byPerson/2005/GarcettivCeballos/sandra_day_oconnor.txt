do
you
think
that
the

tried
to
apply

justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
pickering
test,
properly
applied,
would
have
reached
a
different
result
in
this
case?
justice
sandra

o'connor
it
could
have--
justice
sandra

--certainly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
proper
application
of
pickering
would
yield
a
different
result
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
your
answer
to
that
last
question,
mr.
himmelfarb?
justice
sandra

o'connor
so,
no
free
speech
protection
under
pickering.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
about
this
case?
could
it
not
be
resolved
under
a
proper
handling
of
pickering?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
about
retaliation
claims
that
the
employee
may
have?
what
about
whistleblower
type
claims
by
an
employer?
are
they...
are
they
separate
from
the
first
amendment
concerns?
