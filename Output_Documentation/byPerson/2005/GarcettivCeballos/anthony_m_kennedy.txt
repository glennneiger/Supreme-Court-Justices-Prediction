justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
you
have
the
rule
which
distinguishes
between
employment
related
and
outside
speech,
under
the
hypothetical...
difficult
hypothetical
posed
by
the
chief
justice,
it
would
be
an...
the
promise
would
be
an
unconstitutional
condition,
or
something
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
suppose--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
was
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court.
certainly,
that
wasn't
what
was
involved
in
pickering.
that
was
outside
speech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
same...
and
the
same
with
connick.
so,
i'm...
if
you're
saying
that
this
is
what
the
circuits
have
understood,
fine,
but
that's
not
this...
that's
why
we
took
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
that
that's
an
open
question
under
pickering,
and
that
this
case
presents
it.
do
you...
do
you
concede...
and
maybe
you
don't...
that
there
is
any
category
of
first
amendment
speech,
as
a
matter
of
public
concern,
which
an
employee
cannot
direct
to
the
employer?
are
there...
are
there
some
matters
as
to
which
the
employer
can
protect
its
own
interests
and
stifle
the
employee's
speech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
there's
always
pickering
balance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--any
comment
that
an
employee
makes
regarding
how
the
office
is
working
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
i
would
concede
that.
i
mean--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
has
to
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
consequence
of
your
view
is
to
have
the
first
amendment
being
used
for
courts
to
monitor
the
discussions
that
take
place
in
every
public
agency...
local,
state,
and
federal...
in
the
united
states.
it's...
you
are
advocating
a
sweeping
rule.
now,
you'll
say,
"oh,
well,
pickering
balance
will
protect
it.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
still
think
the
intrusive
consequences
of
your...
of
your
rule
are
sweeping.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
don't
under--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
understand
the
ultimate
answer
you
gave
the
hypothetical.
i
don't
understand
the
principle
you're
following.
i
mean,
it's
a
matter
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
would
agree
this
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
don't
have
a
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the
federal--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--federal
courts
supervise
the
constant
dialogue
that
is
the
everyday
routine
practice
in
every
governmental
agency,
local
and
federal,
in
the
united
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
this
case,
the
supervisor
said,
"there
can't
be...
can't
be
tracks
on
asphalt,
so
you're
probably
right.
"
then
he
finds
out
that
it's
a
tire
rim,
and
of
course
the
rim
makes
a...
so
we
have
to
find
out
this
at
discovery...
at
the
discovery
stage
of
a
lawsuit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
you're
saying
is,
is
that
the
first
amendment
has
an
office
and
a
function
within
the
confines
of
a
government
agency
that
it
doesn't
have
outside.
that's
a
curious
calculus.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
amendment
has
its
most
application
when
you
talk
to
newspapers,
when
you
talk
outside.
that's
what
the
first
amendment's
about.
the
first
amendment
isn't
about
policing
the
workplace.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
we
do
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
we
do
this
as
a...
so
we
do
this
as
a
matter
of
what
is
sound
management
principles
for
a
government
agency?
how
does
that
relate
to
the
first
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there
would...
in
this
case,
unlike
any
other
case
i've
seen
in
the
employment
area,
there
is
a
hearing
in...
before
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
who
goes
into
this.
that's
what
the
criminal
trial
is
for.
and
he
did.
there
was
also
a
grievance
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
suppose
the
public
might
have
an
interest
in
knowing
about
this
debate.
i
don't
know
if
you
can
say
there's
no
public
interest
served.
it
might
be
that
there
are
other
counterbalancing
first...
interests,
but
i
don't
think
you
could
say
we
have
no
interest
in
speech.
this
was...
this
is
a...
on
its
face,
a
rather
interesting...
a
rather
interesting
argument
that
they're...
that
they're
having.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they're
interested
in
criminal
law,
criminal
procedure,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that...
yes,
that's
something
different.
but
your
statement,
that
there's
just
no
first
amendment
interest--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
no,
that's
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
not...
that's
not
the
hypothetical.
so,
suppose
that
a
supervising
district
attorney
tells
the
deputy
district
attorney,
"go
in
and
make
a
misrepresentation
to
the
court,
or
conceal
evidence.
"
or
whatever--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
he
refuses
to
do
that,
or
he
goes
in
and
he
says
the
opposite,
he
tells
the
truth,
and
he's
fired.
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
you're
saying
that
there's
an
exception
to
your
rule,
so
that
if,
in
this
case,
he
has
a...
he
has
a
defense
if
he
said,
"well,
it's
my
duty
to
call
it
as
i
see
it?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
then,
if
that's
so,
you
ought
to
remand
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
i
suppose,
in
this
case,
in
the
hypothetical
we
propose,
that
the
california
courts
and
the
california
bar
would
have
disciplinary
mechanisms
against
the
senior
attorney
who
hypothetically
told
the
junior
attorney
to
mislead.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
california
have,
or
have
not,
disciplinary
procedures
in
the
hypothetical
case
where
a
senior
attorney
who
tells
a
junior
attorney
lie
to
the
court--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pickering
balancing,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
concede
that's
pickering
balancing,
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--perhaps,
1983,
if
you
go
the
unconstitutional
condition
argument,
and
certainly
in
1983...
or
arguably
a
civil
rights
prosecution
against
the
senior
who
ordered--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
their...
the
interest
they
claim
that
of
supervising
their
employees.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that's
the
interest
that
we're
concerned
with,
is
of
having
the
government
have
the
capacity
to
be
able
to
control
the
speech
of
its
employees
so
they
could
have
a
consistent
policy
and
so
that
it
can
explain
to
the
people
what
it's
doing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
the
one
that's
asking
us
to
adopt
a
rule.
and
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
there
is
an
interest
that's
sacrificed
by
the
rule
that
you
request,
and
that
is
the
government's
interest
in
regularity
and
consistency
of
its
speech.
they
don't
have
to
claim
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
you're
the
ones
that
are
asking
us
to
make
this
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
you...
are
you
saying
the
california
courts
would
tolerate
a
situation
where
a
member
of
the
bar
told
one
of
his
employees
to
misrepresent
to
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
california
courts--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
california
courts
are
certainly
not
tolerating...
and,
in
fact,
this
case
was
heard
by
a
california
court,
and
the...
and
the
judge,
as
i
read
the
record...
it's
not
altogether
clear...
seemed
to
agree
with
the...
with
the
police
officers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
we
consider
that
the
question
raised,
whether
or
not
a
deputy
district
attorney
has
a
first
amendment
right
to
send
a
memo
to
his
supervisors
that
the
supervisors
disagree
with.
for
some
years
now,
respondent,
richard
ceballos,
has
been
a
deputy
district
attorney
for
the
los
angeles
county
district
attorney’s
office.
the
present
dispute
arises
from
actions
taken
by
cabellos
and
his
supervisors
relating
to
a
criminal
prosecution
that
the
office
was
handling.
cabellos
at
the
time
was
a
calendar
deputy,
which
meant
that
he
had
certain
supervisory
duties
in
the
district
attorney’s
office.
a
defense
attorney
contacted
ceballos
about
a
pending
case.
the
defense
attorney
said
there
were
inaccuracies
in
an
affidavit
that
the
sheriff’s
office
had
used
to
obtain
a
critical
search
warrant.
after
examining
the
affidavit
and
visiting
the
location
it
described,
ceballos
agreed
that
the
affidavit
set
forth
in
his
view
serious
misrepresentations.
he
relayed
those
findings
to
a
supervisor
and
followed
up
by
submitting
a
memo,
recommending
that
the
case,
the
criminal
case,
not
go
forward.
despite
ceballos’
recommendation,
his
supervisors
ultimately
decided
to
proceed
with
the
prosecution.
a
state
trial
court
later
heard
objections
to
the
affidavit
and
warrant,
and
the
trial
court
in
the
criminal
prosecution
ruled
in
the
prosecution’s
favor.
cabellos
claims
that
in
the
aftermath
of
these
events,
he
was
subjected
to
a
series
of
retaliatory
employment
actions,
and
these
included,
according
to
his
allegations,
reassignment
and
the
denial
of
a
promotion.
he
sued
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california,
asserting,
to
the
extent
relevant
in
this
case,
a
claim
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983.
he
alleged
that
by
retaliating
against
him
for
his
memo,
his
superiors
in
the
district
attorney’s
office
had
violated
his
free-speech
rights
under
the
first
amendment,
which
is
made
applicable
to
the
states,
of
course,
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
petitioners
responded
that
no
retaliatory
actions
were
taken
against
ceballos
and
that
in
any
event
his
memo
was
not
protected
speech.
now,
the
district
court
granted
petitioner’s
motion
for
summary
of
judgment,
agreeing
that
the
constitution
does
not
protect
ceballos
from
retaliation
based
on
the
memo;
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit
reversed;
and
we
granted
certiorari.
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
cabellos
conveyed
his
concerns
about
the
search
warrant
in
a
memo
to
his
supervisors.
in
that
he
expressed
his
views
inside
his
office
rather
than
publicly
is
not
dispositive.
employees
in
some
cases
may
receive
first
amendment
protection
for
expressions
made
at
work.
the
memo
concerned
the
subject
matter
of
cabellos’
employment,
and
this,
too,
is
nondispositive.
the
controlling
factor
in
cabellos’
case
is
that
his
expressions
were
made
pursuant
to
his
duties
as
a
calendar
deputy.
we
hold
that
when
public
employees
make
statements
pursuant
to
their
official
duties,
the
employees
are
not
speaking
as
citizens
for
first
amendment
purposes,
and
the
constitution
does
not
insulate
their
communications
from
employer
discipline.
cabellos
wrote
his
disposition
memo
because
that
is
part
of
what
he
as
a
calendar
deputy
was
employed
to
do.
it
is
immaterial
whether
he
experienced
some
personal
gratification
from
writing
the
memo;
the
significant
point
is
that
restricting
speech
that
owes
its
existence
to
a
public
employee’s
professional
responsibilities
does
not
infringe
any
liberties
the
employee
might
have
enjoyed
as
a
private
citizen.
cabellos
did
not
act
as
a
citizen
when
he
went
about
conducting
his
daily
professional
activities,
such
as
supervising
attorneys,
investigating
charges
and
preparing
filings.
in
the
same
way,
he
did
not
speak
as
a
citizen
writing
the
memo
that
addressed
the
proper
disposition
of
a
pending
criminal
case.
the
fact
that
cabellos’
duty
sometimes
require
him
to
speak
or
write
does
not
mean
that
his
supervisors
were
prohibited
from
evaluating
his
performance.
when
an
employee
speaks
as
a
citizen
addressing
a
matter
of
public
concern,
the
first
amendment
requires
a
delicate
balancing
of
the
competing
interests
surrounding
the
speech
and
its
consequences.
when,
however,
the
employee
is
simply
performing
his
or
her
job
duties,
there
is
no
warrant
for
a
similar
degree
of
scrutiny.
cabellos’
proposed
contrarily
rule
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
commit
state
and
federal
courts
to
a
new
permanent
and
intrusive
role,
mandating
judicial
oversight
of
communications
between
and
among
government
employees
and
their
superiors
in
the
course
of
official
business,
and
in
our
view
that
would
be
a
dramatic
alteration
of
rules
both
of
federalism
and
separation
of
powers.
this
displacement
of
managerial
discretion
by
judicial
supervision
finds
no
support
in
the
precedents.
exposing
governmental
inefficiency
and
misconduct
is
a
matter
of
considerable
significance.
as
this
court
noted
in
connick
v.
myers,
public
employers
should
as
a
matter
of
good
judgment
be
receptive
to
constructive
criticism
offered
by
their
employees.
the
dictates
of
sound
judgment
are
reinforced
by
the
powerful
network
of
legislative
enactment,
such
as
whistleblower-protection
laws
and
labor
codes,
available
to
those
who
seek
to
expose
wrongdoing.
cases
involving
governmental
attorneys
in
addition
implicate
safeguards
in
the
form
of,
for
example,
professional
rules
of
conduct
and
constitutional
obligations
apart
from
the
first
amendment.
we
reject,
however,
the
notion
that
the
first
amendment
protects
from
discipline
the
expressions
made
by
employees
pursuant
to
their
professional
duties.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
join;
and
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
