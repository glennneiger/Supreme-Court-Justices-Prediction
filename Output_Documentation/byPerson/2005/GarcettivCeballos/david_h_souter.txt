justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's...
i
mean,
i
can
see--
justice
david
h.
souter
--counsel,
you
made
the
point
that
if
we
go
the
ninth
circuit
way,
every
time
an
employee
gets
dutch
there's
a
potential
first
amendment
issue.
why
hasn't
that
been
a
problem
since
1988
in
the
ninth
circuit?
i
think
1988
was
the
year
of
the
circuit's
roth
decision.
so,
we
haven't
seen
a
deluge,
and
doesn't
that
rather
discount
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize
that,
but
that...
as
i
understand
it,
that
has
been
true
since
the
ninth
circuit's
roth
decision
in
1988.
and
apparently
we
have
not
seen
a
deluge
of
these
claims,
or
we
would
have
had
citations
to
the
cases.
so,
doesn't
that
rather
discount
the
concern
that
you
express?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
didn't...
maybe
i'm
wrong
on
my
assumption,
but
didn't
the
ninth
circuit
take
that
position,
back
in
1988?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
how
do
we
know
that?
we're
at
summary
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
that,
but
where
do
you...
how
do
you
infer,
from
that,
that
the
individual,
the
employee,
was
not
telling
the
truth?
justice
david
h.
souter
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
my
ethical
record
amounted
to
a
lie
every
time
i
made
a...
an
inaccurate
prediction
about
what
a
court
was
going
to
do
when
i
was
a
young
lawyer,
i
would
have
had
a
very
short
career.
[laughter]
and
that
seems
to
me
as
much
as
you
can
infer
from
what
this
individual
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
we
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
don't
know
why
it
didn't
pan
out
the
way
he
said
it
was
going
to,
and
we
don't
know
that
he
was...
that
he
was
lying.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
that
true
in
this
case?
i
realize
they
didn't
get
to
it
on
summary
judgment,
but
is
that
true
in
this
case
with
respect
to
a
brady
disclosure?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if...
what
if
the
lawyer
simply
believes
that
he
has
an
ethical
obligation
to
make
the
disclosure,
and
he
makes
it,
and
he
is
then
subject
to
retaliation?
no
first
amendment
claim
on
his
part?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
that
mean...
what's
your
answer
to
my
question?
if
he
makes
the
brady
disclosure
because
he
believes
that
is
an
ethical
obligation,
and
he
is
then
subject
to
retaliation,
does
he
have
a
first
amendment
claim,
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
let
me
ask
you
this...
do
you
propose
drawing
the
line...
or
at
least
drawing
a
line
in
some
circumstances
this
way:
that,
at
step
one,
if
it
can
be
concluded
that
a
private
communication
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
would
have
constituted
the
discharge
of
the
employee's
assigned
work...
so
that
it
would
have
been
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
and,
therefore,
not
subject
to
pickering
balancing,
if
he
had
made
the
statement
to
the
employer...
that,
therefore,
the
statement
cannot
be
regarded
as
a
statement
of
public
interest,
even
if
he
had
disclosed
it
publicly,
or
if
he
took
a
further
step
and
went
to
the
bar
association
and
whatnot?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it
is
within...
i'm
sorry,
but
if
it...
if
it
is
within
the
speaker's
assigned
duties
as
an
employee,
does
that
preclude
a
conclusion,
later
on,
that
he
was
speaking
as
a
citizen,
even
if
he
goes
public
with
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
we
do
have,
then,
the
problem
that
justice
stevens
has
raised.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
he
does
let
the
employer
try
first,
and
the
employer
does
nothing,
then
he
goes
public?
where
does
the
pickering
balance
come
out
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
does--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
does
mean
that
potentially...
as
the
government
says,
potentially
every
case
is
at
least
going
to
get
as
far
as
summary
judgment
in
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
do--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
we
know
how
many
cases
of
this
sort
there
are?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
over
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--period
of
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
all
of
the
circuits--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
follow
a
ninth
circuit
kind
of
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
wasn't
that
equally
true
in
connick?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
mean
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
a
fine
characterization,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that
helps
us.
in
connick,
the
one
subject
of
the
speech
that
was
held
to
be
protected
was
the
speech
questioning
political
pressure
to
help
in
campaigns
and
so
on.
the
issue
here
that
would
arguably
favor
protection
is
the
issue
of
calling
public
attention
to
lying
by
police
officers
in
criminal
cases.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
if
there's
a
public
interest
in
political
pressure,
there's
a
public
interest
in
mendacity
in
law
enforcement.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
may
well...
i
guess
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
get
at...
and
it
goes
back
to
your
original
public
interest
issue...
is,
let's
assume...
as
justice
scalia's
hypo
had
it,
let's
assume
that
the
statement
made
by
the
employee
on
the
subject
within
job
duties...
case
like
this
one...
is,
in
fact,
a
"stupid
statement".
let's
assume
it's
wrong,
it's
inaccurate,
whatnot.
the
issue
is
not
whether
an
employer,
it
seems
to
me,
should,
if
that
turns
out
to
be
the
case,
be
able
to
fire.
the
issue,
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether,
if
it
is
not
stupid,
it
should
be
totally
unprotected,
so
that
the
employer
could
do
anything,
even
if
it's
an
accurate
statement.
and
my
understanding
is
that
your
argument
on
public
interest
was
an
argument
that
says,
even
if
it's
accurate
and
they
were
lying
and
so
on,
that
there
should
be
no
protection.
am
i...
and
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
take--
justice
david
h.
souter
--take
the
case
in
which
the
employee
says,
"it
was
accurate".
the
employer
says,
"no,
it
was
stupid.
"
"you
got
everything
wrong.
"
i
take
it,
in...
your
position
is
that
regardless
of
whether
the
employee
got
it
right
or
not,
there
shouldn't
be
protection,
because
it's
within
job
duties.
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
just
as
a
matter
of
fact...
i
thought
his
1983
claim
listed
the
speech
to
the
mexican
american
bar
association
as
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
was
demoted,
or
whatever
it
was,
transferred.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
focus
may
have
changed,
but,
i
mean,
he
hadn't
dropped
the...
he
hadn't
dropped
the
claim
that
that
was
one
of
the
causes--
justice
david
h.
souter
--of
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--did
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
let
me...
let
me
raise
this
question.
if,
in
this
case,
he
gets
past
step
one
because
of
the
mexican
bar
association
speech,
and
if,
as
you
suggested
in
answer
to
a
question
a
little
while
ago,
that
anybody
could
go
public
and
get
at
least
past
step
one
of
pickering,
what
is
to
be
gained
by
the
extremely...
well,
strike
the
"extremely"...
what
is
to
be
gained
by
the
restrictive
view
that
you
take
that
if
he
doesn't
go
to
the
bar
association,
or
doesn't
go
public,
there's
no
protection
at
all?
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
public
is
being
protected
in
a
way
subject
to
an
immediate
end
run.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
if
he
simply
goes
to
the
public
and
says,
"look,
there's
brady
material
here,
and
it
should
be
turned
over,
and,
instead,
my
boss
is
telling
me
to
suppress
it.
"
that
wouldn't
be
turning
over
his
work
product.
and
i
took
it,
from
what
you
said
earlier,
that,
in
that
case,
you
would
say
at
least
he
gets
pasts
step
one
of
pickering
for
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--newspapers--
justice
david
h.
souter
--oh,
he
might...
he
might
ultimately
lose,
just
the
way,
on
all
issues
but
one,
the
employee
in
connick
lost.
that's
quite
true.
but
at
least--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there
would
be
a
claim
to
go
through
the
balancing--
justice
david
h.
souter
--exercise.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
understand
your
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
saying
he
would
win
on
pickering
balancing,
but
he
would
at
least
get
to
the
point
of
going
through
the
balancing
exercise.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
you
take
the
position,
then,
that...
going
to
the
earlier
hypothetical
that
somebody
brought
up,
that,
say,
in
a
brady
case,
if
the...
if
the
federal
prosecutor
believes
there
was
brady
material
that...
and
let's
assume
he's
correct,
just
to
make
it
a
simple
case...
that
there's
brady
material
to
be
turned
over,
and
the
u.s.
attorney
says,
"do
not
turn
the
brady
material
over.
"
that
if
the...
if
the
u.s....
if
the...
if
the
prosecutor
tells
this
to
a
court,
that
he
can
be
disciplined?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i'm
sure--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
what
about,
you
know,
the
basic
first
amendment--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
why
would
you
recognize
a
due
process
violation
if
you
wouldn't
recognize
a
first
amendment
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
neither
does
due
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
to
get
to
the
unconstitutional
condition,
wouldn't
you
normally
look
to
the
first
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
interrupt
you?
i
thought
you
said
that,
in
this
case,
as
distinct
from
givhan,
there
would
be
cognizable
employer
interests
in
incompetence,
the
truth
of
what
was
said,
the
capacity
to
do
the
job
without
roiling
the
waters
unduly,
and
so
on.
and
that,
i
take
it,
is
not
necessarily
so
in
a
givhan
situation.
or
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
the
employer
has
the
same
interest
in
each.
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
have--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
givhan,
if
the
employee's
assigned
duties
were
all
done
competently,
but
she
had
just
gone
off
the
deep
end
on
racial
balance
or
something,
the
employer
would
not
have
had...
if...
so
long
as
it
was
the...
a
private
communication
like
that,
i
don't
know
that
the
employer
would
have
had
an
interest
in
saying,
"well,
you're
incompetent
on
the
subject
of
racial
balance,
and
therefore
i...
you
know,
i'm
going
to
demote
you
or
fire
you.
"
but
in
the
case
in
which
the
employee
is
talking
on
the
subject
within
the
job
description,
then
the
employer
has
got...
i
thought
you
were
saying
he's
got
a
direct
interest
in
competence,
truth,
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
