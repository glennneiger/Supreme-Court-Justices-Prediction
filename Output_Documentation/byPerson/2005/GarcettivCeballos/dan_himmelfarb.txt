mr.

a
brady
obligation
is
an
obligation
of
a
prosecutor
in
his
capacity
as
a
prosecutor;
and
a
brady
disclosure,
like
a
recommendation
to
a
superior
that
there
should
be
a
brady
disclosure,
constitutes
the
exercise
of
the
prosecutorial
function
by
a
prosecutor.
it
is
employee
speech,
and
that
speech,
if
it
engenders
an
employment
action,
should
not
be
sufficient
for
the
employee
to
get
past
the
first
step
of
the
pickering
balancing.
if
there
is--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
we
think
a
proper
handling
of
pickering
is
that
respondents
should
not
get
past
step
one
of
the
balancing,
because
the
speech
is
expressed
in
his
capacity
as
an
employee.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
don't
think
they
are,
justice
o'connor,
if
the
whistle
blowing
is
required
by
the
employee's
speech.
if
an
investigator
in
an
inspector
general's
office,
whose
job
it
is
to
investigate
and
report
government
misconduct,
reports
misconduct,
and
an
action
is
taken
as
a
result...
an
employment
action
is
taken
against
them
as
a
result...
he
is
demoted
or
transferred,
because
it's
the
view
of
his
superior
that
he
didn't
perform
his
job
properly
in
speaking
on
that
issue...
that
should
not
enable
the
investigator
to
get
past
the
first
step.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
case
would
be
covered
by
this
court's
patronage
cases,
which
would
absolutely
prohibit
that
sort
of
employment
action.
but
in
a
case
where
it's
not
party
affiliation
that
motivates
the
employment
action,
if
the
speech
is
expressed
in
carrying
out
the
employee's
duties,
he
may
have
a
civil
service
remedy...
indeed,
that's
precisely
what
the
civil
service
laws
were
designed
to
deal
with,
a
situation
where
the
employee
is
just
doing
his
job,
an
action
is
taken
again
him,
and
there's
a
dispute
as
to
whether
he
was
doing
his
job
properly,
about
whether
he
was
insubordinate,
or
simply
about
whether
he
was--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
don't
think
so,
justice--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--breyer.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
to--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--to--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--to
use
the
example
of
this
case,
if
respondent
advised
his
supervisor
that,
in
his
professional
judgment,
a
brady
disclosure
should
be
made,
and
if
the
supervisor
disagreed
with
him,
and
if
reasonable
minds
could
differ
as
to
whether
the
disclosure
should
be
made,
and
he
made
it,
nonetheless,
he
would
be
insubordinate.
and
we
don't
think
that
that
is
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--justice
breyer--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--if
it's...
if
it's
a
situation
where
reasonable
minds
cannot
differ,
and
the
superior
directs
him
not
to
make
the
disclosure,
in
clear
contravention
of
the
due
process
clause
as
interpreted
in
brady,
that
is
a
situation--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--if
he
made
the
statement
in
a
public
speech--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--or
in
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
a
newspaper,
we
think
that
speech
would
be
presumptively
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
maybe
he
could,
justice
stevens,
but
that
would
be
subject
to
balancing,
and
it
would
be
the
employer's
duty
to
justify
the
firing,
based
on
workplace
disruption.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
it's
not
that
odd,
justice
stevens,
because
if
you
have
an
obligation
to
report
misconduct...
take,
again,
the
example
of
the
investigator
in
the
inspector
general's
office...
you
will
ordinarily
be
better
off
by
reporting
it
through
the
ordinary
channels.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
because,
ordinarily,
you
have--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
you
have
presumptive
first
amendment
protection.
if
you
work
in
the
inspector
general's
office,
and
there
is
a
prohibition
on
disclosing
pending
investigations,
and
you
hold
a
press
conference,
there
is
a
very
good
chance
you're
going
to
lose
at
step
two
of
pickering,
which
is
why
it's
in
your
interest
to
disclose
it
through
appropriate
channels,
because--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
that's
right.
if
you
have
an...
if
it's
a
part
of
your
job,
you
have
an
incentive
to
do
it,
just
like
any
other
job
requirement.
and
it's
ordinarily
not
the
case
that
public
employees
are
punished
for
doing
their
jobs.
they're
more
often
punished
for
not
doing
their
jobs.
so,
in
that
situation,
the
employee
is
going
to
likely
be
better
off
by
making
the
disclosure
through
appropriate
channels.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
true,
justice
stevens,
but
civil...
it's
our
view
that
civil
service
laws
are
the
mechanism
for
dealing
with
a
situation
where
you're
doing
your
job
and
there's
a
dispute
as
to
whether
you're
doing
it
properly
or
not.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
if
the...
if
the
memo
is
required
by
his
job,
it's--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--a
recommendation
about
what
policy
the
agency--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--should
take--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
in
answer
to
your
question
of
how
difficult
it's
going
to
be
to
draw
the
line,
i
think
in
most
cases
it
won't
be
difficult
to
draw
the
line.
i
don't
think
it
was
difficult
in
this
case.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
that
applied
principle
we
advocate
where
it
has
been.
there
may
be
some
cases
where
it
will
be
difficult
to
draw
the
line,
but--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that
may--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that
may...
that
may
be,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
scalia.
this
court
has
already
decided
that
it's
important
to
draw
a
line
at
step
one
in
distinguishing
between
speech
on
a
matter
of
public
concern
and
speech
on
a
matter
of
private
concern,
even
though
it
will
often
be
hard
to
draw
that
line.
and
the
reason
that
line
has
to
be
drawn
is
that
the
alternative
is,
in
effect,
to
constitutionalize
the
law
of
public
employment.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
souter,
we
see
these
as
two
separate
requirements
to
get
past
step
one.
the
speech
has
to
be
on
a
matter
of
public
concern,
but
it
also
has
to
be
speech
in
the
speaker's
capacity
as
a
citizen.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
don't
think
it
does,
justice
souter.
if--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
i
don't...
i
don't
see
it
as
much
of
a
problem,
for
the
reasons
i
tried
to
give
in
responding
to
justice
stevens.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
my
understanding
is
that
that's
not
part
of
the
complaint,
justice
ginsburg.
and
my
understanding
also
is
that,
in
the
district
court,
respondent
took
the
position
that
his
testimony
at
the
hearing
was
in
his
capacity
as
an
employee.
