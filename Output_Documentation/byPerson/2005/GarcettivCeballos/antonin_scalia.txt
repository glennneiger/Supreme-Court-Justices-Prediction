justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that,
in
the
situation
the
chief
justice
mentioned,
the
professor
would
still
be
able
to
contend
that
the
university
fired
him
because
it
disagreed
with
the
political
content
of
his
speech
or
because
of
the
university's
politics.
he
could
still
make
that
claim,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--burden
would
be
on
him,
as
it
would
be
in
most
cases--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
show
that
that
was
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas,
the
ninth
circuit
would
put
it
on
the...
put
the
burden
on
the
university
to
show
that
it
wasn't
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
if
your
job
is
to
speak
truth,
and
you
speak
falsehood,
that's
a
good
reason
to
fire
you,
which
is
what
happened
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--contend
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
you
don't
have
to
establish
that
he
was
lying;
just
that
his
prediction...
his
job,
was
to
predict,
and
he
made
a...
an
erroneous...
a
false
prediction.
don't
have
to
show
that
he
intended
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
the
answer
to
the
first
question,
john.
was
he
not
fired
because
he
had
made
an
improper
assessment?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
defense
is
that
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--actions
were
not
taken
with
any
reference
to
this...
to
this
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
surely
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--surely
a
factual
inquiry,
which
will
be
disputed.
if
you
want
to
win
on
summary
judgment,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
establish
that,
assuming
he
was
fired
because
of
this
speech,
that
would
be...
or
not
promoted
because
of
his
speech...
that
would
be
perfectly
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
assume--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
that
was
the
reason
for
the
later
actions.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
reason...
what
if
the
reason
for
the...
for
firing
him
is
that
he's
a
democrat
and
it's
a
republican
administration,
and
the
speech
is
used
as
the
pretext?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose
that
what
constitutes
a
matter
of
public
interest
is
not
the
clearest
line
in
the
world
either,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i
think
all
the
cases
did
say
"expressing
views
as
a
citizen
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
"
wasn't
that
qualifier
always
used?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
what
does
it
mean?
what
is...
what
is
your
explanation
for
that
qualifier,
"expressing
views
as
a
citizen"?
why
do
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--continually
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
just
shouldn't
have
said
"as
a
citizen"
in
all
of
these
cases.
we
were
just
padding
our
opinion
with
unnecessary
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
any...
is
any
duty
of
an
employee
in
a...
an
agency
devoted
to
service
of
the
public...
is
any
of
his
functions
not
a
matter
of
public
concern?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
news.
this
is
a
press...
a
press
kind
of
a
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
newsworthy.
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
if
an
employee...
i
really
don't
understand
it...
an
employee
comes
forward
with
some
scurrilous
information
about
a
family
member
of
his
boss,
who
is
a
public
figure,
and
his
whole
families
are
public
figures,
which
would
be
picked
up
by
the
press,
that
would
be
a
matter
of
public
concern?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
never
understood
that
that's
what
the
test
was.
i
thought
this
was
a
matter
that
deals
with
the
welfare
of
the
public,
rather
than...
rather
than
the
welfare
of
the
press.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
welfare
of
the
public.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
he's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he's
just
saying,
you
know,
his
boss's
wife,
a
mayor
of
a
big
city,
is
running
around
with
somebody.
okay?
and
that's
picked
up
by
the
press.
it's
there
on
the
gossip
pages.
she's
a
public
figure.
you
say
that
would
be
covered
by
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
that
would
get
in
the
press.
that's
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
nobody's
wacko
here.
i
mean,
it's
plainly--
[laughter]
--plainly
false.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's...
i
was
just
going
to
jump
in
there...
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
is,
look
at...
if
you
want
to
be
sure
that,
in
every
case,
you
know,
the
good
cases
fall
on
this
side,
the
bad
cases
fall
on...
he
should
buy
your
position
that
every
case
should
go
to
a
balancing
test.
that
will
give
you
the
perfection
of
first
amendment
application.
the
absolute
perfection.
now,
it'll
cost
a
lot
of
money,
and
it'll,
you
know,
interfere
with
a
lot
of
employment
things,
but
it
will
give
you
first
amendment
perfection.
right?
i
mean,
that's
the
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
court
of
appeals.
you
really
don't
know
how
many
district
court
judgments
there
may
have
been
that
didn't
go
up
to
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i'm--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
justice
ginsburg's
question.
her
question
was,
don't
whistleblower
statutes
cover
this?
and
your
answer,
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
is,
whistleblower
statutes
cover
this,
and
a
lot
more.
that
doesn't
prove--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
doesn't
prove--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
they
don't
take
care
of
this
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
would
not
cover
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
the
difference,
not
the
lack
of
public
interest--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--pointing
to,
is
that
in
one
case
he
is
making
this
statement
as
an
employee;
and
you
say
the
employer,
if
it's
a
stupid
statement,
ought
to
be
able
to
fire
him
for
it.
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
other
case,
he's
making
the
statement
as
a
member
of
the
public.
and
what
the
first
amendment
is
all
about
is
that
we
allow
stupid
statements
to
be
made.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
he
could
go
public,
i
assume.
he
could
say,
"i
got
fired
for
saying
this.
"
"and
this
was
true.
"
right?
take
it
to
the
press.
the
press
would
love
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
assuming
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
required
to
be
kept--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
sure
you'd
agree
with
that,
if
it's
his
duty
to
call
it
or...
just
as
it's
the
duty
of
a...
of
a
lawyer
not
to
lie
to
the
court.
if
there
was
a
similarly
clear
legal
duty
for
him
to
say
something,
you'd
say
that
was
part
of
his
job
description,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
adopt
a
principle
that
every
employee
ought
to...
ought
to
report
to
his
superiors
known
wrongdoing
by
his
co
workers,
and
that
that's
part
of
his
job
duties,
you...
then
you
always
cut
off
the
ability
of
that
employee
to
go
public,
right?
i
mean,
that's
a...
sort
of
an
expanding
category,
"job
duties".
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
on.
i'll
let--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
hear
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
public
employee
unions
are
so
weak?
they're
the
only
strong
unions
left
in
the
country.
i
mean,
really.
[laughter]
you
need
the
constitution
to
protect
employees
against
things
of
this
sort?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
neither
should
a
superior
be
required
to
get
a
report
from
a
subordinate
that
he
thinks
is
way
off
base,
just
a
result
of
poor
judgment,
thinking
that
there...
that
there
was
a
violation
here,
when
there...
when
there
obviously
wasn't,
or
using
facts
that
were
not
sufficiently
established
in
order
to
claim
such
a
violation.
surely,
the
employer
is
entitled
to
say,
"on
the
basis
of
this
report,
which
you
gave
me,
you're
fired.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
or...
you
know,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that'll--
justice
antonin
scalia
--always
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
claim.
that'll
always
be
the
claim.
they'll
always
say,
"oh,
yeah,
you
said
you
did
it
because
of
that,
but
you
did
it
because
you're
retaliating--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--"#
for
this
or
that".
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
not...
that's
not
established.
that's
not
established
at
all.
his
supervisor
obviously
thought
he
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
it's
a
very
serious
allegation
for
somebody
who's
in
the
position
that
this
employee
was
to
make
against
police
officers.
and
as
i
understood
the
case,
the
supervisor
said,
"wow,
i
don't
want
loose
cannons
around
down
there
who
are
accusing
perfectly
honest
and
respectable
police
officers
of
violating
the
law.
"
now,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--hasn't
been
proven,
either.
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
is
certainly
a
possibility.
and
i
do
not
want
to
exclude
the
ability
of
a
supervisor
to
fire
somebody,
if
that
possibility
exists,
without
having
to
go
through
extensive
litigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
amendment
value
may
be
the
same,
but
it...
but
what
is
present
is
another
value.
and
unless
the
person
is
going
to
go
public,
in
which
case
the
balancing
occurs,
and
assuming
there's
no
prohibition
of
it,
that
other
value
is
a
very
significant
one,
the
ability
of
public
officials
to
run
their
offices.
justice
antonin
scalia
cases
involving
those
questions
would
have
to
go
to
the
courts,
i
assume.
but
they'd
be
a
small
percentage
of
all
the
cases
that
would
go
to
the
courts
if
we
adopt
your
position.
i
agree,
there
will
still
be
some
cases
left
that'll
have
to
go
to
the
courts
to
sort
out
these
questions
that
you
mentioned.
but
that's
going
to
be
a
small
percentage
of
the
totality.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
it's
been
unclear,
until
this
court
has
spoken
to
the
subject,
and
especially
in
light
of
the
dicta
in
our
prior
cases,
which
says
that
he
has
to
be
speaking
publicly.
the
reason
for
the...
for
the...
for
the
paucity
of
cases
can
be,
simply,
that
the
law
was
not
clear,
and
most
people
thought
the
way...
the
way
your
opponent
in
this
case
thinks.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
court
didn't
say
this
guy
had
blue
eyes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
said
he
was
speaking
as
a...
that
seemed
to
the
court
to
be
important
to
its
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
lee--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
respond
to
the
argument
that
this
has
been
the
law
in
a
number
of
circuits
and
the
sky
has
not
fallen?
