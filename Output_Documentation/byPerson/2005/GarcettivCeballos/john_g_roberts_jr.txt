we'll
hear
argument
now
in
garcetti
v.
ceballos.
ms.
lee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
if
a
public
university
professor,
who...
is
fired
for
the
content
of
his
lectures?
certainly,
in
the
course
of
his
employment,
that's
what
he's
paid
to
do.
that
has
no
first
amendment
protection?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
"should
not
be
entitled,
presumptively,
to
first
amendment
protection.
"
what
does
that
mean?
that
there
might
be
first
amendment
protection,
in
light
of
the
particular
context--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--of
the
speech?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
you
might
have
argued
that
it's
speech
paid
for
by
the
government,
that's
what
they
pay
him
for,
it's
their
speech;
and
so,
there's
no
first
amendment
issue
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--ms.
lee.
mr.
himmelfarb.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
going
to
be
clear
that
that's
violating
your
job,
and
it
has
an
adverse
impact
on
your
job
related
duties,
because
you're
going
public,
instead
of
going
through
the
channels.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
comfortable
are
you
that
this
line
you're
trying
to
draw
is
one
that's
going
to
be
workable
in
practice?
i
mean,
suppose
the
employee
writes
a
memo,
and
the
boss
comes
and
says,
"if
you
don't
promise
me
you're
not
going
to
talk
about
this
publicly,
you're
fired.
"
and
he
says,
"well,
i'm
not
going
to
promise
that.
"
and
so,
he's
fired.
now,
is
that
internal,
or
is
that
external?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--required
by
his
job.
but
"promise
that
he's
not
going
to
talk
about
it.
"
is
not
required
by
his
job.
and
this
case,
kind
of,
raises
the
question,
because
the
only
reason
it's
squarely
presented
on
the
memo
is
because
the
court
didn't
reach
the
brady
disclosure
or
the
talk
to
the
bar
association
that
were
related
to
the
memo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
himmelfarb.
ms.
robin
vergeer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
justice--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
if
the
employee
filed
a
lawsuit
claiming
a
violation
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
you
would
say
that
could
not
be
thrown
out,
on
summary
judgment,
on
the
ground
that
the
speech
was
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
would--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--be
a
dispute
of
fact,
so
it
probably
wouldn't...
so
it
wouldn't
be
thrown
at
summary
judgment
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
doesn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--why
doesn't
rust
answer
this
question?
i
mean,
there,
it
was
really...
this
issue
was
just
outsourced
by
the
government.
they
paid
for
the
speech
there,
and
we
said
that
if
you
pay
the
piper,
you
get
to
call
the
tune.
and
this
is
just
an
insourced...
the
same
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
was
writing
a
memo
about
why
the
case
should
be
dismissed.
wasn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
part
of
his
job?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
is
that?
in
the...
in
your
hypothetical,
the
doctor
is...
it's
not
his
job
to
challenge
the
restriction
on
the
government
grant,
but
that's
what
he's
doing,
so
that's
not
part
of
his
job.
here,
it's
part
of
ceballos's
job
to
explain
why
the
case
should
be
dismissed,
and
that's
what
he
wrote
in
his
memo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
your
friend's
response
to
that,
that
in
connick
the
court
characterized
givhan
as
involving
a
case
of
a
citizen
complaining
about
a
particular
practice?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
he
should
have
lost
under
the
pickering
balance,
in
that
case,
if
he
went
public
right
away?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
government
misconduct...
if
i
get
a
memo
from
a
law
clerk
that
says,
"justice
so
and
so's
jurisprudence
is
wacky",
that
goes
to--
[laughter]
--that
goes
to
government
misconduct,
under
your
theory,
right?
and
i
fire
them,
because
i
think
that's
not
appropriate
to
put
in
a
memo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
have
a
first
amendment
claim,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
disagree
with
it.
they
think
it's...
whatever...
unprincipled,
wrong.
they
write
me
a
memo,
and
i
say,
"don't
write
me
a
memo
like
that.
"
and
they
write
me
another
one,
and
then
i
fire
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
they
think
it's
government
misconduct
because
of
the
way
cases
are
decided,
and
that
they
have
a
first
amendment
interest.
what
could
be
more
important
than
how
the
court
decides
cases?
and
that
violates
their
first
amendment
rights.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--a
dispute
about
that
in
this
case,
too.
i
mean,
it...
under
the
supervisor's
view,
it
may
come
down
to
simply
whether
there
were
tire
tracks
or
tire
rim
tracks.
and
that's
not
as
serious,
in
one
view,
as
your
client
thinks
it's
serious.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
some
of
them--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
fact,
don't
cover
disclosures
that
are
job
related.
if
it's
the
employee's
job
to
blow
the
whistle
on
this
type
of
thing,
it's
usually
not
covered
by
a
whistleblower
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
i'm--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thinking
of
the
federal
law,
where
the
idea
is,
if
it's
part
of
your
job,
you
have
the
normal
civil
service
job
protections
if
you're
being
retaliated
or
discriminated
against
for
doing
your
job,
so
you
don't
get
the
extra
protections
of
the
whistleblower
law.
the
only
people
who
get
it
are
the
people
who...
it
is
not
part
of
their
job.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
thank
you,
ms.
robin
vergeer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
lee,
you
have
one
minute
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
04-473,
garcetti
versus
ceballos.
ms.
lee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
court--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
court
of
appeals
did--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
court
of
appeals
specifically
did
not
address
the
mexican
american
bar
association
speech.
it
focused
only
on
the
memorandum,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
lee.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
ms.
robin
vergeer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it's
probably
a
bit
much
to
say
that
the
core
of
the
first
amendment
is
internal
employee
grievances
or
speech.
and
i
think
the
concern
on
the
other
side
is
that
you
may...
as
a
lawyer,
you
may
have
a
view
of
what
the...
what
brady
requires.
your
superior
may
have
a
different
view.
and
just
because
that
disagreement
exists
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
continue
to
voice
your
view
when
your
superior
has
reached
a
different
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you're
just
hiding
behind
the
fact
that
they
claimed
that
it
wasn't
in
retaliation.
your
assertion
still
puts
them
in
the
position
of
having
to
defend
a
constitutional
claim
on
a
case
by
case
basis
every
time
there's
a
disagreement
between
a
subordinate
and
a
superior
about,
as
in
this
case,
what
brady
requires.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
was
a
disagreement
about
whether
or
not
his
memorandum
accurately
reflected,
in
an
appropriate
way,
what
was
at
issue
there.
there
was
a
disagreement
about
the
content
of
the
allegations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
because--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they're
addressed...
is
it...
they're
addressed
under
state
and
federal
whistle
blower
laws,
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
if--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--none
of
that
were
true...
if
none
of
that
were
true,
he
could
still
file
his
complaint.
presumably
it
survives
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
it
goes
at
least
to
summary
judgment.
and
that's
true
in
every
case
of
a
disagreement
between
a
subordinate
and
a
superior.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--was
my
point
earlier.
they
can't
make
short
shrift
of
those
cases,
because
they're
not
going
to
be
thrown
out
at
the
pleading
stage.
they're
going
to
have
to
progress
at
least
to
summary
judgment,
probably
in
every
case
in
which
an
employee
is
terminated,
because
now
one
of
his
defenses
against
termination
is,
"you're
violating
my
first
amendment
rights.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
context
in
which
this
law
developed.
it
developed,
originally...
if
you
were
a
public
employee,
you
did
not
have
free
speech
rights
as
a
citizen.
as
justice
holmes
said,
you
know,
you
might
have
the
right
to
speak,
but
you
don't
have
the
right
to
be
a
policeman.
so,
the
"as
a
citizen"
part
didn't
come
out
of
happenstance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
recognizing
that
when
you
are
speaking
"as
a
citizen",
juxtaposition
to
"as
an
employee",
then
you
do
have
first
amendment
rights.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
robin
vergeer.
ms.
lee,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--ms.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
kennedy,
who
has
sworn
in
as
a
federal
judge
30
years
ago
today,
has
the
opinion
in
04-473,
garcetti
versus
ceballos.
