justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
we
have
an
instance
where
it
is
job
related.
he
is
not
speaking
as
a
private
citizen,
and
it's
also
a
public
concern.
now,
in
such
an
instance,
could
we
say
that,
at
least
if
the
matter
of
public
concern
rise
to
the
level
where
it's
related
to
an
independent
constitutional
protection...
say,
founded
in
the
due
process
clause...
under
those
circumstances,
the
employer
cannot
unreasonably...
though
we
give
him
an
area
of
discretion,
he
cannot
unreasonably
retaliate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
and
here
is
an
independent
obligation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
very
unusual--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
it's
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you'd
only
lose...
the
government
would
lose,
only
where
you
can
conclude
that
they
could...
"they",
the
government...
could
not...
could
not
reasonably
conclude
that
he'd
been
insubordinate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
we
covered
the
case
of
the
democrat,
republican,
et
cetera.
in
other
words,
we'd
give
him...
should
we
give
him
total
discretion?
can't
we
limit
that
discretion
of
the
supervisor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
our
law
clerks
would
meet
it
every
day.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
maybe,
maybe
not.
i
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--anything
that
goes
on
in
my
chamber
that
isn't
a
matter
of
public
concern,
and
i
would
think
everything
at
osha
and
everything
at...
look,
i'll...
let
me
put
my
question
to
you,
because
you're
going
to
make
an
argument
that
i
don't
think
is
too
widely
shared;
namely,
that
pickering
decides
this
case.
if
that's
your
argument,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
based
on
the
assumption
pickering
does
not
decide
this
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
pickering
involves
a
case
in
which
it's
both
a
matter
of
public
concern
and
outside
the
scope
of
employment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
here
we
have
a
case
that
is
a
matter
of
public
concern,
but
inside.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
those
circumstances,
i
want
to
know
how
you
believe
the
first
amendment
requires
us
to
decide
this
case.
and
as
i
read
this
case,
in
the
record,
we
have
one
individual,
your
client,
who
looked
at
an
affidavit.
the
affidavit
said
that
the
deputy
sheriffs
were
trying
to
locate
where
a
vehicle
that
was
chocked
up
came
from.
they
saw
tire
tracks.
the
tire
tracks
went
back
to
a
fence
at
the
end
of
a
long
driveway.
so,
i
looked
in
the
record.
i
couldn't
find
the
affidavit.
so,
i
assume
that's
what
it
says.
and
i
wanted
to
know
what
the
deputy
sheriff
said.
what
they
said
is
that
your
client
agreed
that
there
were
tire
tracks.
there
were
tire
tracks
that
did
not
go
the
whole
length
of
the
driveway,
but,
rather,
tire
tracks
near
the
house,
where
they
got
the
search
warrant
for.
and,
they
added,
that...
the
deputies...
that
there
was
rocks
broken
up.
all
right.
so,
we
have
two
sides
to
this
argument:
the
deputies,
who
might
reasonably
contend
that
they
did
nothing
wrong;
your
client,
who
thinks
they
were
lying.
and
we
also
have
a
letter
that
your
client
wrote,
where
he
said
that
these
deputies
are
grossly
inaccurate
and
clearly
misleading.
suppose
his
supervisor
goes
to
him
and
says,
"i
think
that
that
letter
is
not
the
right
tone.
"
"maybe
you're
right,
maybe
you're
wrong;
maybe
they're
in
good
faith,
maybe
they're
not.
"
"and
so,
if
you
don't
change
that
tone,
i'm
going
to
discipline
you.
"
all
right?
now,
that's
my
hypothetical,
which
seemed
to
me,
perhaps,
very
much
like
this
case.
how,
in
your
opinion,
does
the
first
amendment
handle
such
a
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
what
i'm
looking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for.
i'm
looking
for--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
not
making
my
question
too
clear.
i'm,
imagine,
the
district
judge.
i
get
just
the
facts
i
described
to
you.
your
client,
who's
very
upset,
says,
"this
is
the
most
unreasonable
thing
that
ever
happened.
"
"they
were
trying
to
prevent
me
from
communicating
with
the
judge.
"
"i'm
the
one
who
saw
the
sheriffs.
"
"they
didn't.
"
the
other
side
says,
"we
think
it's
reasonable
what
we
did.
"
my
question
to
you
is,
what
standard
does
that
judge
apply
under
the
first
amendment?
what
does
he
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
live
in
a
world
where
people
are
leaking
things
all
the
time.
and
there
are
thousands
of
things
that
are
in
the
public
interest
every
day.
but
what's
bothering
me
is,
while
i
see
the
government's
rule
as
protecting
the
interests
of
the
employer,
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
never
is
there
an
instance
where
the
first
amendment
offers
protection.
but
the
only
choice
you've
given
me
is
a
rule
that
says
every
dispute
of
the
public
interest
is
going
to
go
right
into
constitutional
litigation.
and
i
don't
like
that
either.
so,
am
i
hopelessly--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--forced
to
choose
which
is
the
lesser
of
the
evils,
or
is
there
some
middle
approach
that
gives
discretion
to
the
government,
but
doesn't
allow
them
to
exceed
that
discretion
in
a
certain
category
of
cases?
if
so,
what?
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
would
you
phrase
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
your
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i've
got...
you've
got
me
part
of
the
way.
now,
i'm
not
saying
i...
i
have
to
think
this
through,
but
you
got
part
of
the
way.
you
say
here,
there's
an
independent
constitutional
basis
for
the
speech
being
permitted.
but,
now,
still
within
that,
the
government
agency
has
to
have
some
authority
to
discipline
a
person,
even
there,
because,
after
all,
he
might
have
been
accusing
these
sheriffs
of
things
that
were
really
not
justified
by
what
they,
in
fact,
did.
or
maybe
he
was
right.
what
about
that
part
of
the
standard?
do
you
want
to
say
that
the
government
wins,
as
long
as
it
behaved
reasonably?
do
you
want
to
say
that
the
government
loses
only
if
there
was
an
abuse
of
ordinary
employer
discretion?
do
you
want
to
say
the
government...
et
cetera.
what
do
you
want
to
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
were
to
write
this,
hypothetically.
indeed,
the
employer
has
broad
discretion
to
discipline
the
employee
for
the
manner...
or
whatever
he
does...
even
in
such
an
area,
but
that
discretion
can
be
abused.
and,
therefore,
it
is
up
to
the
judge
to
determine
whether
a
jury
could
find
such
abuse
of
discretion
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
isn't
the
point.
i
think
the
point
is,
at
least
for...
i
think
point
is
who
is
going
to
decide
whether
there
was
some
justification
here.
and
i
read
this
memo.
i
thought
that
the
da
had
a
pretty
good
claim,
that
the
police
didn't
do
anything
wrong.
and
there's
also
an
argument
they
did.
all
right.
so,
who
decides
that
kind
of
thing?
a
constitutional
court
or
a
state,
under
its
protection
laws
or
whistle
blower
statutes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
argument
that
you
have
to
face,
i
think,
is
that
it
will
be
very
disruptive
to
have
constitutional
judges
dive
into
this,
when
there
are
so
many
other
remedies,
and
where
the
very
act
of
their
doing
it,
allowing
discovery,
allowing
court
cases,
allowing
juries,
itself,
will
disrupt
the
government.
now,
if
you
say
they
give
you
no
protection
at
all,
i
want
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
as
to
what
the
standard
is
to
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
cases
that
would
go
into
court
are
cases
where
the
employer
says,
"i
have
no
reason
at
all
for
firing
him?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
think
they
have
a
better
claim
on
the
other
part.
i
mean,
if...
even
if
you're
right
in
this
one,
i
promise
you,
the
next
one
will
come
along,
and
they'll
say,
"of
course
we
had
a
good
reason
for
firing
him.
"
"one,
we
didn't
fire
him
for
that
reason.
"
"two,
if
we
did,
we
would
have
been
justified.
"
or
whatever.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
your
standard
is,
the
only
cases
that
go
into
court
under
the
first
amendment
are
cases
where
the
employer
says,
"i
had
no
basis
for
doing
anything
to
him
whatsoever.
"
then
i
think
there
will
be
few
such
cases,
though
you
might
convince
me
that
that
standard--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--wouldn't
do
any
harm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
say
it's
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--borderline
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what
he
has--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
the
argument
that
i
think
people
are
worried
about,
against
you,
is,
you
have
a
case...
it's
actually
a
wonderful
example.
your
client
thinks
that,
in
the
affidavit
that
the
sheriffs
gave
supporting
the
warrant,
they
didn't
tell
the
truth,
because
they
said
that
whoever
was
looking
into
it,
you
know,
said
there
was
a
private
driveway
and
that
there
were
tire
tracks,
and
there
were
no
tire
tracks,
and
it
wasn't
a
private
driveway.
the
other
side
says,
"yes,
it
was
a
long
road,
but
sort
of
like
a
driveway,
and
the
edge
of
the...
of
the
driveway
was
broken
down,
and
that's
what
the
sheriff's
deputies
were
referring
to.
"
i
found
it
a
dispute
on
both
sides.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if,
in
fact,
he's
being
disciplined
for
that,
the
other
side
is
telling
you
he
has
a
lot
of
remedies,
he
has
a
variety
of
remedies.
go
to
the
bar
associations.
many
states
have
laws,
the
statutes
that
protect
people
under
these
situations.
and
why
suddenly
go
to
a
constitutional
court
to
get
the
same
relief
which
will
short
circuit
all
the
other
remedies?
and
if
you
do,
there
are
going
to
be
thousands
of
cases
less
good
than
yours,
and
they'll
all
run
to...
to
the
constitutional
court.
all
right.
so,
now,
what's
your
reply?
