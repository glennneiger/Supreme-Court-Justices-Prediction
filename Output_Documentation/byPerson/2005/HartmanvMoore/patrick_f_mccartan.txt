mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
justice
stevens,
if
it
please
the
court--
if
i
may,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
very
pointed
inquiry
that
justice
kennedy
made
at
the
opening
of
the
argument
here.
the
petitioners
here
do
not
challenge,
because
they
cannot
challenge,
as
was
evident
from
the
concession
made
here
this
morning,
that
a
criminal
prosecution
cannot
be
based
upon
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right.
what
they
want
is
an
exception
to
that
rule,
an
exception
that
would
mean,
despite
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
retaliation
of
record
in
this
case,
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
first
amendment
here
and
that
would
treat
any
prosecution
based
solely
upon
race,
religion,
or
protected
speech
the
same
as
a
tort
for
malicious
prosecution.
and
to
accomplish
this
end,
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
force
probable
cause
as
a
standard
into
a
framework
where
it
doesn't
belong,
where
it
won't
work,
and
which,
if
done
here,
is
going
to
be
contrary
to
several
existing
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that
would
be
the
test,
your
honor,
for
recovery
when
the
matter
goes
to
trial.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
test
that
i
would
propose
is
the
very
test
that
this
court
set
forth
in
harlow
against
fitzgerald
because
we're
here
really
on
a
very
limited
issue
of
qualified
immunity.
we
have
to
determine
whether
the
defense
of
qualified
immunity
is
available
to
the
petitioners
here.
the
standard,
the
proper
standard
for
making
that
determination
was
set
forth
by
this
court
in
harlow
and
it's
whether
the
conduct
alleged--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--well,
your
honor,
whether...
no,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--i
think
what
they
are
saying
is
the
defense
of
qualified
immunity
should
be
available
if
there
should
be
probable
cause
for
the
action
that
was
taken
here.
i
think
the
case
before
the
court
is
on
the
very
limited
issue
of
whether
the
defense
of
qualified
immunity
is
available
to
the
petitioners.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
exactly
what
they're
saying,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
is
the
wrong
standard
to
be
applying.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
all
right.
well,
your
honor,
let...
let
me...
let
me
back
up
for
just
a
moment
then
with
respect
to
that.
let
me
say
that
probable
cause
is
not
the
proper
standard
which
should
be
applied
here.
the
proper
standard
is
the
standard
that
is
set
forth
by
this
court
in
harlow
and
as
refined
later
in
anderson
against
creighton
and
a
number
of
other
decisions.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
standard
that
is
to
be
set
forth
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
is
that
that
this
court
applied
in
mt.
healthy
city
school
district
against
doyle
and
in
crawford
el
against
britton,
and
that
is
if
there
is
illegally
or
unconstitutionally
motivated
conduct,
it
will
not
be
excused
simply
because
there
may
be
some
objectively
valid
basis
for
taking
such
action.
that
is
the
conceptual
framework
that
was
established
in
those
cases
and
which
should
be
applied
by
way
of
analysis.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that
is
exactly
the
argument,
your
honor,
and
what
it
comes
down
to
is
whether
the
burdens
of
litigation
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
will
justify
judicial
alteration
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
and
i
think
that's
been
very
clear
from
the
outset
in
the
first
question
justice
kennedy
asked.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
but
see--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--that's
what
he's
arguing,
and
those
are
not
screening
mechanisms,
your
honor.
probable
cause
was
evident
and
was
present
in
united
states
against
armstrong
and
wayte
against
the
united
states.
it
was
not
deemed
by
this
court
to
be
a
bar
to
the
selective
prosecution
claims
that
were
advanced
in
that...
in
those
cases.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
yes.
i
think,
first
of
all,
empirically,
your
honor,
there's
no
evidence
to
the
effect
that
bivens
has
had
that
result
after
35
years
in
full
force
and
effect.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
if
you
examine
part
iv
of
the
court's
opinion
in
crawford
el,
there
is
a
very
careful
pattern
that
is
set
forth
as
to
how
cases
of
this
kind
should
proceed
and
what
protections
are
available
to
protect
government
officials
against
overly
burdensome
litigation.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
opinion
in
crawford
el
against
britton.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
there,
the
court
held
that
if
there
are
factually
specific
allegations
that
would
indicate
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
that
at
that
point
the
court
may
consider
whether
some
additional
discovery
should
be
permitted
even
if
there
should
be
an
independently
valid
basis.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
it
did
not,
your
honor,
but
it
provides
the
same--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--it
provides
the
same
framework
for
the
proper
analysis
of
a
claim
of
this
kind.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--it
is
far
less
dangerous,
your
honor,
than
when
this
is
asserted
by
way
of
defense
in
the
middle
of
an
ongoing
criminal
prosecution.
it
can
be
far
more
disruptive
to
allege
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
as
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution,
while
that
prosecution
is
in
progress,
and
an
effort
is
made
to
examine
prosecutorial
decision
making
than
in
an
after
the
fact,
after
acquittal
civil
action
for
damages,
such
as
we
have
here.
you
have
already
permitted
that
kind
of
examination
in
criminal
cases
where
probable
cause
is
present.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
they
would
have
to
prove
that
something
other
than
hostility
to
protected
speech
was
the
reason
for
the
prosecution
being
advanced.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no.
that's...
that's
what
i
mean.
absent...
if
there
is
an
objectively
valid
basis--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--the
government
claims
there
is
an
objectively
valid
basis
for
the
action
they
action
they
would
take.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
then
if
the
plaintiff
has
made
a
showing
that
there
was
an
improper
motivation,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
government
to
show
that
the
prosecution
would
have
proceeded
absent
the
illicit
intent.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
as--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--as...
as
you
pointed
out
earlier,
probable
cause
is
not
the
standard
that
governs
the
investigator's
conduct.
these
investigators
procured
a
prosecution
based
upon
a
violation
of
the
petitioner's...
or
excuse
me...
the
respondent's
constitutional
rights.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no,
i--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--well,
the
prosecutor
has
absolute
immunity.
there's
a
qualified
immunity
here
with
respect
to
the
investigators,
and
that
means
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
are
going
to
have
to
determine
whether
there's
liability.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
burden
would
shift
once
the
illegal
motivation
is
shown.
it
would
shift
to
the
government
to
establish
that
the
prosecution
would
have
proceeded
absent
the
illicit
event.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
it
shouldn't
be
the
end
of
the
case.
there
would
be
an
issue
of
causation
at
that
point,
your
honor,
if
there
were
evidence.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
motivation
for
his
decision--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--but
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor's
decision
to
bring
these
charges
to
the
grand
jury
i
don't
think
has
any
probative
force
whatsoever.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
of
course.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
prosecutor
is
not
a
defendant,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
his
testimony
was
taken
in
this
case
and
can
be
taken
in
this
case
because
at
that
point
in
these
proceedings...
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
evidence
of
record
to
this
point
in
this
proceeding...
there
is
very
clear
evidence
of
retaliation
as
a
motive
for
this
prosecution.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
your
honor,
the
fact
that
he
has
absolute
immunity
does
not
immunize
him
from
giving
testimony
in
the
case.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
he's
a...
he's
a
witness.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
suppose
the
person
is
convicted.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
heck
against
humphrey
i
think
would
stand
in
the
way
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
it's
not
a
simple
case.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
if
he
is
convicted
and
a
civil
action
for
damages
is
then
brought--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--then
i
think
you
are
in
the
framework
of
heck
against
humphrey--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--where
the
court--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--no.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no.
i
think
it's
very
difficult
in
that
case.
in
heck
against
humphrey,
which
this
court
viewed
as
a
collateral
attack
on
an
outstanding
conviction,
the
court
held
that
there
had
to
be
a
favorable
termination
of
the
criminal
proceeding
in
order
to
maintain
the
civil
action
for
damages
under
section
1983.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
court
went
on
to
say,
however,
that
if
the
civil
damage
action
would
not
necessarily
impugn
the
conviction,
that
the
case
could
proceed
even
though
there
had
not
been
a
favorable
termination,
reversal,
or
expungement--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--of
the
conviction.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i
don't
think
that
action
would
be
permitted
to
proceed.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
it
would
be
viewed
as
a
collateral
attack
on
an
outstanding
conviction.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i...
i
don't
think--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
that's
a
real
world
example.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
right.
and
why
probable
cause
is
not
the
appropriate
standard
is
because
it
does
not
distinguish
between
what
might
be
an
unconstitutional
prosecution...
that
is,
one
based
solely
upon
race,
religion,
or
protected
speech...
and
one
that
is
not.
when
you
look
to
these
earlier
cases,
your
honor,
i
agree
they
arose
in
employment
contexts.
they
arose
in
the
context
of
a
prison.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
yes.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
yes.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
and
i--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--your
honor--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--i
submit
the
screen
is
that
set
forth
by
this
court
in
harlow,
which
is
an
objective
standard
and
which
is
whether
the
conduct
involved
violated
a
clearly
established
statutory
or
constitutional
right
of
which
a
reasonably
prudent
law
enforcement
officer
or
government
official
should
be
aware.
that's
why
i
tried
to
say
earlier
this
standard
that
should
govern
this
case
is
not
probable
cause,
but
the
standard
set
forth
by
this
court
in
harlow--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--and
is
a
screening.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
right.
and
there
was
no
screening
mechanism
in
united
states
against
armstrong.
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
what
you
were
applying
there
were
ordinary
equal
protection
standards.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
this
court
has
not
decided
what
the
proper
remedy
would
be
there,
your
honor.
and
the
cases--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
where
that
has
succeeded
except
at
the
circuit
court
level--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--where
the
conviction
has
been
invalidated
for
that
reason.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
yes,
your
honor.
it
might
be
the
same
here.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
for
the
first
amendment.
no,
i'm
not
aware
of...
certainly
no
decisions
of
this
court,
and
i
think
the
only
cases
arise--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
the
question--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--you
can
move
for
dismissal
of
the
charges.
but
look,
as
far
back
as
1886,
this
court...
this
court
found
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
in
a
racially
motivated
prosecution
in
a
situation
where
there
was
clearly
probable
cause
and,
indeed,
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt
for
violation
of
a
facially
neutral
statute.
in
united
states
against
armstrong,
the
existence
of
probable
cause
did
not
stand
as
a
bar
to
the
selective
prosecution
claims.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
this
case.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
exactly,
your
honor.
that--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--we
don't...
that
is
exactly
the
harlow
standard.
that
is
exactly
the
standard
that
was
applied
in
crawford
el
against
britton
as
the
first
step
in
the
stage
of
developments
in
that
case.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
exactly.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
exactly.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
the
threshold
determination
in
a
bivens
action
of
this
kind.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
yick
wo
against
hopkins.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no,
no.
armstrong--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--much
more
recently,
but
yick
wo
against
hopkins.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
result
is
that's
a
question
of
causation,
your
honor,
if
there
is
evidence.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
yes.
if
there
is
evidence
here
with
respect
to
retaliation,
then
the
question
of
whether
the
independent
act
of
the
prosecutor
somehow
immunizes
that
conduct
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
trier
of
fact
in
the
case.
if
the
action--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--that's
the
evidence
the
government
can
bring
forward
when
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
upon
a
showing
of
an
illegal
or
unconstitutional
motive
for
bringing
the
prosecution
to
begin
with.
that's
the
kind
of
evidence
the
government
would
present
to
show
that
the
prosecution
would
have
taken
effect
in
any--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--exactly.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
exactly.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
because
the
prosecutor
has
immunity,
cannot
be
a
defendant
in
the
case.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no,
absolutely.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
i
think
that
is
a
significant
distinction,
your
honor,
but
i
think
we
have
to
establish
that
they
procured
the
prosecution
and
that
it
did
proceed
by
reasons
of
the
illegal
motivation
and
not
for
some
independently
objective
standard.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
absolutely.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
consider
too
what
the
facts
of
record
are
here.
this
prosecutor
was
a
complicit
conduit
in
this
action.
he
admitted
in
the
presence
of
a
grand
jury
witness
that
he
couldn't
care
less
about
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
these
people.
he
just
wanted
a
conviction
so
he
could
obtain
a
lucrative
position
in
private
practice.
i
understand
he
is
still
a
prosecutor
at
this
time.
but
that
decision
of
the
prosecutor,
based
upon
facts
of
that
kind,
has
no
probative
value
whatsoever
in
terms
of
the
independent
action
that
might
have
broken
the
chain
of
causation
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
nor
does
the
indictment
of
the
grand
jury
have
any
probative
value
because
exculpatory
evidence
was
withheld
from
the
grand
jury.
and
i
think
in
determining
the
value
of
the
grand
jury's
action,
you
have
to
really
determine
not
only
what
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
but
also
what
was
withheld
from
examination.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
there...
there
is
precedent
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
your
honor.
the
cases,
i
think,
are
cited
in
our
brief
where
prosecutions
have
been
invalidated
based
upon
violations
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
first
amendment
rights.
i
think
that
is
the
case.
not
cited
in
our
brief.
but
there
are
cases
to
that
effect.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
post
prosecution.
not
post
prosecution
damage
actions
but
appeals,
direct
appeals,
to
invalidate
the
conviction--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--based
upon
the
violation--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--well,
bivens
is.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i'm
not
aware,
your
honor,
of
any
precedents--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--in
the
three
circuits
where
probable
cause
is
not
a
bar
to
an
action
of
that
kind.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
i
think
it
would
be
the
former
rather
than
the
latter,
your
honor,
since
probable
cause
does
not
distinguish
between
what
may
be
an
unconstitutional
act
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
one
that
might
be
motivated
by
a
legitimate
grievance.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
think
this
case
is
before
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
if
i
may--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
is
that...
was
that
an
observation
or
a
question?
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
but
as
justice
souter
brought...
questioned
whether
the
prosecution
was
procured
for
unconstitutional
reasons,
the
immunity
of
the
prosecutor
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
reasons
for
which
the
prosecution
is
brought.
it
only
protects
him
from
civil
damage
liability.
the
investigators
themselves
have
no
such
immunity.
it
is
qualified.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no.
i
think
that
is
the
difference,
your
honor,
between
absolute
and
qualified
immunity.
the
court
has
given
absolute
immunity
only
to
those
functions
that
are
so
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
process,
that
they
have
to
give
immunity
to
those
people,
otherwise
there
would
be
an
unjust
interference
with--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--well,
certainly
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
jury,
your
honor,
absence
of
probable
cause.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
it
depends
on
what
ground
we
would
lose
here.
if
the
court
went
on
to
decide
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations
in
a
bivens
type
case,
which
i
don't
think
it
should
and
which
the
court
declined
the
invitation
to
do
so
in
harlow,
then
we
would
not
lose.
if
you
did--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--all
right.
may
i
say
one
word
about
the
tort
of
malicious
prosecution,
which
i
say
is
not
a
proper
analog
for
the
analysis
of
cases
of
this
kind?
the
interests
that
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment
are
far
different
from
those
that
are
remedied
by
the
tort
of
malicious
prosecution,
and
the
injury
to
which
is
of
far
greater
magnitude
than
what
the
common
law
sought
to
address
by
the
tort
of
malicious
prosecution.
the
tort
of
a
malicious
prosecution
tells
us
nothing
about
the
interests
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
it
remedies
different
interests.
it
is
not
a
proper
analog
and,
therefore,
shouldn't
be
involved
in
definition
of
what
the
first
amendment
rights
may
be.
if
you
look
at
those
cases
where
the
court
has
referenced
the
common
law
in
determining
how
constitutional
rights
should
be
remedied,
they
have
been
situations
where
the
interests
protected
at
common
law
are
identical
to
those
that
are
protected
by
the
particular
constitutional
provision
that
is
involved.
a
good
example
is
wilson
against
arkansas,
fourth
amendment
situation,
the
question
of
whether
the
knock
and
announce
principle
of
common
law
should
be
incorporated
into
the
reasonableness
determination
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
interest
protected
by
the
common
law
in
that
situation
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
was
identical
to
the
interest
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
for
that
reason,
the
court
said
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
the
action
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
if
he
were
foolish
enough
to
make
such
a
claim--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--i
can't
believe
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
prosecution
who
is
acquitted
in
a
subsequent
civil
suit--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
you
say
he's
not
acquitted.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
i
don't
think
he'd
be
in
the
middle
of
trial
under
heck
against
humphrey.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
this
is
not
a
civil
action
for
damages.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
this
is
a
criminal
case.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that
would
not
suffice.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
and
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
harlow,
mere--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--if
the...
if
the
defendant
in
that
case
had
established
evidence
tending
to
show
the
essential
elements
of
the
claim,
it
would
present
a
question
for
the
court,
but
i
think
the
court
would
use
the
admission
against
interest
as
a
basis
for
paying
no
attention
to
such--
