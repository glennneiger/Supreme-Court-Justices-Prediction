justice
david
h.
souter
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
why...
why
we
should
make
the
classification
that
you
did,
that...
that
retaliatory
is
simply
a
species
of...
of
malicious.
i
mean,
i...
i
can
see
the
similarities,
but
we've
also
got
an
entirely
separate
first
amendment
value
here
which
just
is
not
part
of
the...
the
analytical
mix
when
you're
talking
about
malicious
prosecution.
so
i'm
not
sure
why
we
should...
we...
we
should
classify
it
as
you
argue.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's...
it's
a
peculiar,
if
you
will,
a
peculiar
malice
with
its
own
set
of
constitutional
values,
and
i
don't
know
of
anything
comparable
in...
in
malicious
prosecution
generically.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
difficulty
i
think
we're
all
having
with
it
is
that
the
qualified
immunity
issue
and
the
standard
to
which
you
are...
are
adverting
responds
to
a
question
that
doesn't
arise
unless
we
first
assume
that
there
is...
that
there
is
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
our
questions
are
what
is
the
standard
for
determining
the
constitutional
violation.
once
we
get
that
squared
away,
then
we'll
get
to
harlow.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
did,
but
wouldn't
you
have
to
prove
under
your
standard
not
that
they
would
have
procured
or
tried
to
procure
it
anyway,
but
that
in
fact
the
prosecutor
would
have
prosecuted
anyway?
in
other
words,
that's
the
distinction
between
the...
the
normal
case
and...
and
the
case
that
we're
dealing
with
here--
justice
david
h.
souter
--with
a
prosecutor
who
has
absolute
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
all
right--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
the...
the
screen,
in
effect,
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
qualified
immunity
screen.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
turn
the
harlow
standard
around...
i
mean,
you're...
you're
making
the...
the
negation
of
the
harlow
standard
the
screening
device--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
justice
breyer's
example.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
the
burden
does
shift
that
way--
justice
david
h.
souter
--wouldn't
it
be
consistent
with
the
screening
mechanism
that
justice
breyer
suggested
and...
and
that
you
accepted?
wouldn't...
wouldn't
the...
the...
when
the
burden
shifts,
wouldn't
the
obligation
be
on...
on
the
point
of
substance,
as
opposed
to
the
point
of...
of
screening,
not
to
show
that
the...
that
the
prosecutor
would
have
brought
the
prosecution
anyway,
but
to
show
that
the
investigator
would
have
acted
to
procure
that
prosecution
anyway?
so
you
would
have
parallel
standards.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
just...
i
just
want
to
nail
this--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
so
you're...
you're
modifying
your
position
of
a
minute
ago
in
which
you
said
the
standard
would
be
would
the
prosecution
have
been
brought
anyway,
and
you're
now
saying,
which
i
think
would
be
consistent
with
your
answer
to
justice
breyer,
the...
the
question
is
would
the
investigators
have
tried
to
procure
the
prosecution
anyway.
and
do
i
understand
you
correctly,
and...
and
have
you
changed
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
a
dual--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
the
criminal
trial.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
original
criminal
trial.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
is
a
bivens
action
against
criminal
investigators,
charging
them
with
inducing
a
prosecution
against
the
respondent
moore
in
retaliation
for
moore's
lobbying
efforts
aimed
at
convincing
the
united
states
postal
service
to
incorporate
multiline
optical
scanning
technology.
the
question
is
whether
moore
must
show
the
absence
of
probable
cause
for
pressing
the
underlying
criminal
charges.
we
hold
that,
one,
a
prosecution
must
be
alleged
and
proven
as
part
of
a
claim
of
retaliatory
prosecution.
in
the
1980s,
moore
ran
a
company
making
machines
that
could
read
multiple
lines
of
text,
and
moore
was
prominent
among
those
who
publicly
campaigned
against
the
postal
service's
use
of
single
line
technology
for
mail
sorting.
the
leadership
of
the
postal
services
allegedly
asked
moore
to
back
off
on
his
lobbying
efforts
and
threatened
to
stop
doing
business
with
his
company
if
he
persisted.
eventually,
the
postal
service
begrudgingly
embraced
multiline
technology
but
it
awarded
a
lucrative
contract
for
multiline
equipment
to
one
of
moore's
competitors.
not
only
did
moore
lose
out
on
the
contract,
but
he
was
soon
entangled
in
two
postal
service
criminal
investigations,
which
led
a
federal
prosecutor
to
seek
and
secure
indictments
against
moore,
his
company
and
the
company's
vice-president.
in
due
course,
the
district
court
found
a
complete
lack
of
direct
evidence
connecting
the
defendants
with
any
of
the
wrongdoing
alleged
and
granted
their
motion
for
acquittal.
moore
then
filed
an
action
against
the
prosecutor
and
postal
inspectors,
arguing
that
they
had
engineered
the
prosecution
in
retaliation
for
his
lobbying
efforts.
after
the
claims
against
the
prosecutor
were
dismissed
on
absolute
immunity
grounds,
the
inspectors
moved
for
summary
judgment,
arguing
that
they
were
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
from
a
retaliatory-prosecution
suit,
because
the
underlying
criminal
charges
against
moore
were
supported
by
probable
cause.
the
district
court
denied
this
motion,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
and
remand.
we
have
held
the
first
amendment
prohibits
government
officials
from
subjecting
an
individual
to
retaliatory
actions,
including
criminal
prosecutions,
for
speaking
out.
in
the
ordinary
retaliation
case,
evidence
of
motive
on
the
part
of
a
government
official
and
injury
suffered
by
the
target
of
that
official's
animus
is
sufficient
for
a
circumstantial
demonstration
that
the
one
caused
the
other.
but
when
the
claimed
retaliation
is
retaliatory
prosecution,
showing
causation
is
more
difficult,
because
the
defendant
in
a
retaliatory-prosecution
case
will
not
be
the
prosecutor
who
has
absolute
immunity,
but
some
other
official
who
allegedly
induced
the
prosecutor
to
act.
thus,
the
causal
connection
is
not
as
it
is
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
simple
and
direct
link
between
the
animus
of
one
official
and
the
injury
that
same
official
inflicts.
rather,
it
is
the
more
attenuated
connection
between
the
retaliatory
motive
of
one
official
and
the
adverse
action
taken
by
another.
in
this
sort
of
case,
proving
a
lack
of
probable
cause
for
the
criminal
prosecution
will
tend
to
reinforce
the
retaliation
evidence
and
show
that
retaliation
was
likely
the
but-for
basis
for
instigating
the
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand,
establishing
the
existence
of
probable
cause
will
suggest
that
the
prosecution
would
have
been
pursued,
even
absent
the
retaliatory
motive.
accordingly,
because
evidence
of
an
inspector's
animus
does
not
necessarily
show
that
he
succeeded
in
inducing
the
prosecutor
to
act
when
he
would
not
otherwise
have
pressed
charges,
and
because
of
the
longstanding
presumption
of
regularity
accorded
prosecutorial
decision-making,
we
hold
that
a
showing
of
the
absence
of
probable
cause
is
required
both
to
bridge
the
gap
between
the
nonprosecuting
government
agent's
retaliatory
motive
and
the
prosecutor's
injurious
action
and
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
regularity.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
breyer
joins;
the
chief
justice
and
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
