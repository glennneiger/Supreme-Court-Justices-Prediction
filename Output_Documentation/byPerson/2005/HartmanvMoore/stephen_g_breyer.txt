justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
really
want
three
things.
you
say
we
want
the
protection,
number
one,
of
there...
if
you're...
if
there's
probable
cause,
that's
the
end
of
it.
number
two,
if
you're
trying
to
show
there
wasn't
probable
cause,
you
have
to
bear
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
number
three,
we
also
have
qualified
immunity.
and
i
guess,
number
four,
you
have
to
prove
the
whole
thing
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
sounds
a
little
bit
like
the
person
who
has
the
overcoat,
turns
up
the
heat,
you
know,
five
or...
what
about
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
this
one?
and
i
want
to
know...
you
simply
say
you
need
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
that
was
the
motive
and
it
wouldn't
have
been
brought
otherwise.
and
the
existence
of
probable
cause
is
a
strong
factor,
maybe
even
a
presumption,
that
suggests
to
the
contrary.
now,
have
states
and
other
places
tried
things
like
that
without
the
world
collapsing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
as
far
as
you
know,
every
state
and
every
jurisdiction
where...
and
investigators
if
they
don't
have
absolutely
immunity,
whatever...
in
all
those
jurisdictions,
nobody
has
ever
said
that
even
a
constitutional
violation,
if
there's
probable
cause,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i'm
not
focusing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
have
no
experience.
we
don't
know.
okay.
as
your...
as
far
as
you
can
tell.
the
other
question
i
have,
which
you
might
want
to
be
brief
about,
is
in
looking
through
this
record,
as
far
as
i
could
see
from
the
briefs,
they
went
ahead
and
prosecuted
this
man
with
only
two
pieces
of
evidence.
the
first
evidence
was
that
he
tore
some
pages
out
of
his
notebook.
but
he
introduced
lots
of
notebooks
to
show
he
always
tore
pages
out
when
he
gave
them
to
his
secretary.
and
the
second
was
that
he
told
some
witnesses
be
very
careful
and
answer
the
question.
now,
you
know,
he
said
a
few
other
things,
but
they
all
seemed
like
the
kind
of
things
that
people
would
always
say
to
witnesses.
now,
if
that's
the
only
evidence,
except
for
the
fact
he
owns
the
company,
how
is
there
probable
cause
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
didn't
see
any
in
the
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
saw
a
lot
about
other
people
in
the
brief,
but
not
about
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
all
kinds
of
things
about
other
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
would
like
you
to
limit
yourself
to
what
i
didn't
concede.
i
concede
it's
his
company.
i
concede
that
he
tore
some
pages
out
of
his
notebook,
and
i
concede
that
he
told...
which
he
did
a
lot
of
times.
and
i
concede
that
he
told
witnesses
answer
the
question,
et
cetera.
now,
is
there
anything
else
connecting
him,
not
his
company?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
is
applied
here,
i...
i
thought
we
just
granted
question
one.
there
were
two
in
the
cert
petition.
i...
my
notes
say
we
just
granted
question
one.
and
that
means
what
they
have
is
the
screen.
we're
going
to
screen
out
absolutely
any
such
claim
as
yours
if
there
is
probable
cause.
now,
the
reason
they
advance
for
doing
that
is
that
in
the...
a
reason
is
in
the
absence
of
a
screen
like
that,
here's
what's
going
to
happen.
every
single
case...
not
every
one,
but
millions
of
cases
or
thousands,
anyway...
involving
companies...
well,
companies
are
going
to
congress
all
the
time.
they
have
ads
all
the
time.
they
run
into
agency
hostility
all
the
time.
the
hell's
angels?
that's
a
pretty
unpopular
defendant.
they
say
things
all
the
time
that
investigators
disagree
with.
and
what
will
happen
is
in
a
vast
number
of
cases
the
defendant
will
decide
to
bring
a
bivens
action,
particularly
if
he
gets
off,
and
then
we'll
have
discovery
and
we'll
look
into
every
statement
that
the...
the
investigator
made
to
the
prosecutor,
and
before
you
know
it,
we
have
a
nightmare
of
tort
cases.
and
they
say
that's
unfortunate
to
cut
off
a
claim
like
yours,
but
after
all,
the
prosecutors
totally
cut
them
off
because
they
have
absolute
immunity.
now,
we're
saying
at
least
let's
restrict
them,
where
investigators
are
involved,
to
cases
where
it
turned
out
there
was
no
probable
cause,
otherwise
the
criminal
process
itself
will
be
seriously
injured.
now,
i
take
it
that's
the
argument.
i'd
like
to
hear
your
reply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
are
you
going
to...
i
mean,
is
there
any
light
you
could
shed?
and
that's
why
i
asked
in
my
question
initially.
i
thought
maybe
there
were
some
jurisdictions
somewhere
that...
that
survive
without
the
rule
they
want,
but
maybe
i'm
wrong.
and...
and
how
do
i
judge
this?
i
would
be
concerned.
i
don't...
the...
after
all,
these
other
cases
you
mentioned
are
civil
tort
cases
and...
and
they
don't
involve
the
criminal
process.
and
when
we
get
into
criminal
prosecutions,
we
have
rules
on
selective
prosecution
that
are
designed
to
screen
out
all
but
the
very
worst.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
he's
arguing
for
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
leaving...
is
there
anything
you
can
say
before
i
give
up
on
this?
and
maybe
the
answer
is
no.
is
there
anything
you
can
say
that
would
relieve
my
concern,
which
is
completely
practical
at
the
moment,
that
if
i
decide
in
your
favor,
there
suddenly
are
going
to
be
large
numbers
of
criminal
cases
where
defendants
will
say
the
reason
i
was
prosecuted
was
because
of
something
i
said?
i
was
advocating
motor
cycles.
i
was
advocating
beating
people
up.
i
was
advocating
a
congressional
change
of
something.
many,
many
such
cases.
they'll
all
get
at
least
discovery,
and
the
prosecutor's
door
will
become
open
to
the
world.
now,
that's
what's
concerning.
can
you
say
anything
to
relieve
that
concern?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he's
a
witness.
suppose
his
testimony--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
that
the
person
is
convicted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
can
you
bring
your
bivens
claim
anyway?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really?
so
that's
a...
but
it's
not
a
civil
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
say
that
if
he's
convicted,
after
all,
he
may
have
been
convicted
but
it
may
be
because
of
the
retaliatory
motive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you...
so
you
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
he's
convicted,
that's
the
end
of
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--whether
there
was
a
retaliatory
motive
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
that's
1983.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
he
does
is
he--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
brings
his
action
and
he
says
here
i
am
20
years
in
prison
and
i
agree
i'm
guilty,
but
they
never
would
have
prosecuted
me
without
the
fact
that
they
hate
the
hell's
angels
and
they,
in
fact,
criticize
everything
that
we
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
he's
saying
i
was...
i
was
guilty,
but
the...
all
right.
anyway--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
won't
force
you
into
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
take
basically
virtually
never
if
he's
convicted.
they
concede
that
you
could
bring
this
kind
of
action
if
there's
no
probable
cause.
so
we're
talking
about
that
range
where
there
was
probable
cause
but
acquittal.
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you're...
you're
in
the
cases,
but
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
pursue
this.
you've
given
me
another
idea--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
i
would
like
to
say
one
word
about
this.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
your
train
of
thought
here,
but
look.
i'm
looking
for
other
screens.
is
there...
is
there...
the
particular
point
that
they're
worried
about
is
you
say
we
want
to
establish
the
retaliatory
motive.
that's
what's
worrying
them
because
they
see,
in
that
establishment
of
the
retaliatory
motive,
discovery,
and
discovery
means
you
not
only
talk
to
the
investigators,
but
you're
also
talking
to,
as
a
witness,
the
prosecutors
to
find
out
who
said
what
to
whom
in
order
to
see
if
you
could
establish
that
they
didn't
like
the
speech
of
the
defendant.
now,
can
you
give
me
any
screen,
not
your
case,
but
any
kind
of
a
screen
that
will
help--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--weed
out
the
sheep
from
the
lambs--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
goats
from
the
sheep
or
whatever--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
that
area?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that...
that's
true.
i
now
think
we're
making
some
progress.
i
don't
think
it
is
quite
a
qualified
immunity.
i
think
it's
possible
and
don't...
i'm
putting
words
in
your
mouth
and
deny
them
if
i
am.
one,
he's
convicted,
no
case.
two,
no
probable
cause,
everybody
agrees
there's
a
case.
three,
now
there
is
probable
cause,
but
he's
acquitted.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
that
circumstance,
suppose
you
say
we
cannot
even
allow
discovery.
you
don't
even
get
to
discovery
on
your
retaliatory
motive
unless
you
show
clearly,
question
mark,
or
unless
you
show
likely,
question
mark,
that
the
investigator
not
only
retaliated,
but
he
retaliated
under
conditions
where
any
reasonable
person
would
have
known
that
what
he
was
doing
was
contrary
to
the
constitution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
don't
show
that
as
a...
as
a
threshold,
you
don't
even
get
discovery.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
other
question.
suppose
you
win
on
this
on
the
grounds
we've
been
discussing.
what
happens
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
when
a
defendant
wants
to
say
the
same
thing?
can
he
avoid
conviction
by
showing
the
same
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
when
the
same
claim
is
made
in
the
middle
of
a
trial
that
i...
whether
i'm
guilty
or
innocent?
i
haven't
been
convicted
yet,
and
i
want
to
show
that
this
prosecution
wouldn't
have
been
brought
in
the
absence
of
the
retaliatory
motive.
can
he
make
that
claim
in
the
middle
of
trial
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no,
he
believes
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
he's
not
acquitted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
in
the
middle
of
trial
and
he
wants
to
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
a
criminal
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
in
a
criminal
trial,
and
what
he
wants--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
read
our
opinion
which
holds
in
your
favor.
then
the
next
thing
is
in...
in
the
criminal
cases
the
defense
lawyers
say,
hey,
i...
i
think
my
client
wouldn't
be
here
today
were
it
not
that
the
fbi
had
a
retaliatory
motive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
they're
going
to
show
exactly
the
elements
that
we
write
in
our
opinion.
