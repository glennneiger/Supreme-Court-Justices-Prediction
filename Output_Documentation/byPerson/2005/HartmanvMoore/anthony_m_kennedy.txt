justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
is
probable
cause
for
a
prosecution,
but
the
prosecutors
are
extremely
busy
and
they...
they
have
to
select
their
cases
and
they
select
one
in
which
they
bring
the
prosecution
against
the
defendant
on
account
of
his
speech.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
prosecutorial
duty?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm...
i'm
asking
is
it
a
violation
of
the
prosecutor's
professional
obligations
and
his
professional
duties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
going
back
to
the
hypothetical,
if...
if
you
acknowledge...
and
i
think
you
must...
that
there's
a
violation
of
the
prosecutorial
duty
in...
in
the
instance
i
suppose,
then
why
shouldn't
the
law
recognize
it
and...
and
give
force
to
that
sanction
and
give
force
to
that
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
well,
then
we'll
just
change
the
hypothetical
to
make
it
the
investigators.
the
investigators
select
their
case
based
on
this
speech
that
they
consider
unwelcome.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
he
have
a
right
not
to
be
singled
out
because
of
his
speech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
asked
does
he
have
a
right
not
to
be
singled
out
because
of
his
speech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
you...
you
would
advise
law
enforcement
officials
that
they
can
single
out
persons
for
prosecution
based
on
distasteful
speech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
agree.
i...
i
think
you
have
to
concede
there
is
this
principle
in
the
law,
and
i
think
your
answer
has
to
be
even
though
there's
that
principle,
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
with
enforcing
it
because
there
are
going
to
be
too
many
suits,
it's
hard
to...
it's
difficult
for
the
government
to
defend,
and...
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
there
been
cases
where
in
the
context
of
the
prosecution,
there's
been
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
because
it
was
brought
in
retaliation
for
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
there
been
cases
in
the
other
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my...
my
question
was
directed
to
the
first
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yick
wo.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yick
wo.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let...
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
the
law
enforcement
official...
the
postal
inspectors
bring
the
prosecution
to
the
prosecutor
because
of
their
disagreement
with
his
first
amendment
views.
the
prosecutor
said,
i
don't
care
about
the
first
amendment
views.
i'm
glad
you
brought
this
to
me.
i'm
going
to
prosecute
because
there's
probable
cause
here
and
this
is
a
bad
actor.
what
results?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
why--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
the
prosecutor
said,
you
shouldn't
have
brought
this
to
me
because
you...
you're...
you're
motivated
by
the
first
amendment.
but
now
that
it's
here,
i
have
my
own
independent
interest
in
going
ahead.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
that...
that
means
one
of
two
things,
either
what
you're
arguing
for
is
not
going
to
bring
a
flood
of
litigation,
or
everyone
has
assumed
that
probable
cause
is
a...
is
a
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that
proposition
has
been
established
in
the
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
but
the
point
remains
that
if
in
the
prosecutorial
context
the
immunity
exists
whether
or
not
there's
a
constitutional
violation,
then
that
teaches
us
that
the
same
rule
should
apply
to
this
case.
that
was

scalia's--
