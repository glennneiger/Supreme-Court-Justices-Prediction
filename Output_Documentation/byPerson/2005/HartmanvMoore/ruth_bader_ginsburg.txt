mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kneedler,
may...
would
you
clarify
just
one
point
about
this
probable
cause?
there
was
a
grand
jury
that
indicted
this
man,
and
then
there
was
a
trial
judge
who
said,
i'm
throwing
this
out
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case.
there
is
not
enough
evidence
here
to
convict
this
man.
are
you
saying
that
as
long
as
the
grand
jury
indicts,
there
can
be
no
bivens
claim
because
in
order
to
indict,
the
grand
jury
would
have
had
to
find
probable
cause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
tell
me
about
now,
not
at
the
common
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
grand
jury
did
find
probable
cause.
so
what
would
the
plaintiff
have
to
show
to
overcome...
to...
to
negate
that
finding
of
probable
cause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
the
d.c.
circuit,
looking
at
this
case,
looking
at
the
record
closely,
typed
it
one
in
which
the
evidence
of
retaliation
was
strong
and
probable
cause
weak.
this
is
on
28a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert.
that
was
the
appraisal
of
the
d.c.
circuit
panel.
and
i
think
you've
been
arguing
that
that
is
not
the
case,
but
at
least
for
our
purposes
at
this
posture,
don't
we...
shouldn't
we
accept
that
that
is
the
picture
here,
weak
evidence
of
probable
cause,
strong
indications
of
retaliation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
not
talking
about
prosecutors
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
about
the
judge
granting
a
motion
to
quit
at
the
close
of
the
government's
evidence?
why
isn't
that
objective?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
opponent
says...
says
there
is
no
probable
cause
requirement.
you
are
now
on
there's
no
objective
test.
it's
all
subjective.
i
suggest
that
there
could
be
an
objective
test.
this
is
not
going
to
the
probable
cause
question.
objective
test?
was
this
case
thrown
out
at
the
close
of
the
government's
evidence?
