justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
04-1495,
hartman
against
moore.
mr.
kneedler,
whenever
you're
ready,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
here--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
you're
not
disputing
either,
as
i
understand
it.
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
we
assume
the
prosecution
would
not
have
been
brought
but
for
the
retaliatory
motive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
you
assume
that
for
the
purposes
of
your
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
the
only
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the...
one
of
the
differences...
am
i
not
correct,
that
at
common
law
the
prosecutor
did
not
have
absolute
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
does,
but
not
at
common
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they're
not
totally
identical
because
you
didn't
have
the
first
amendment
interest
involved
in
those
cases,
whereas
you
do
have
a
first
amendment
interest
at
stake
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
malicious
prosecution
claim.
you'd
have
a
malicious
prosecution
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
kneedler,
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
they
should
be
treated
just
like
a
malicious
prosecution
claim,
which
is
no
distinction
between
a
constitutional
basis
and
a
common...
and
just
that
he
hated
his
brother
in
law.
i
think
you're
saying
they're
the
same.
that's
what
i
understand
justice
scalia
to
be
asking
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
places
no
weight
at
all
on
the
fact
the
constitution
is
involved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
how
you'd
get
at
least
as
much
protection
as
if
it
was
an
ordinary
malicious
prosecution
claim,
but
you
don't
get
any
more
under
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
i
know
you're
responding
to
justice
breyer's
question,
but
i
think
for
purposes
of
our
decision,
we're
not
supposed
to
decide
whether
there
was
probable
cause
or
not,
but
we're
to
give
you
the
opportunity
to
prove
there
was
if...
if
you
win
on
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that's
a
disputed
issue,
and
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
probable
cause
issue.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
because
the
other
side
is
arguing
that
even
if
there
is
probable
cause,
the
burden
shifts
when
they
prove
the
retaliatory
motive,
and
you
have
to
prove
that
you
would
never...
you
made...
you
would
have
brought
the
prosecution
even
if
there
had
been
no
retaliatory
motive.
that's
what
we're
arguing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the
question
i
would
ask
is
why
should
this
be
different
from
a
wrongful
discharge
case
in
which
there's
ample
cause
to
discharge
and
the
issue
boils
down
to
whether
or
not
he
would
have
been
discharged
anyway.
why
isn't
it
the
same...
same
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't...
wouldn't
all
those
considerations
justify
a
rule
that
makes
the
burden
of
proving
the
retaliatory
motive
very
high,
say,
maybe
it
has
to
be
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
or
something
like
that?
but
once
you
have
it
acknowledged...
i
don't
know
if
they're
really
acknowledged
here,
but
there's
strong
evidence
of
retaliatory
motive...
why
shouldn't
the
burden
shift
just
on
that,
on
the
basis
of
that
proof?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
had
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
had
a
heavy
burden
of
proof
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding,
wouldn't
that
protect
the
interests
that
mainly
concern
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mccartan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
mccartan,
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
but
i
thought
the
primary
issue
was
not
the
qualified
immunity
issue,
but
whether
we
have
a
cause
of
action
in
the
first
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
on
that,
they
say
you
don't
have
a
cause
of
action
unless
you're
able
to
prove
an
absence
of
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
there
are
two
questions
in
the
cert
petition
and
it's
the
second
one
that's
the
qualified
immunity
issue,
and
the
first
one
is
whether
there's
a
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
opinion
was
that?
i
missed
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
opinion
are
you
talking
about?
i
missed
it...
missed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
it...
would
it
have
been
a
complete
defense?
suppose
the
prosecutor,
who
is
immune,
gets
on
the
witness
stand
and
says,
well,
i
know
all
about
this...
the
first
amendment
stuff,
but
i
was
going
to
bring
this
prosecution
anyway
because
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
a
serious
crime
here.
that's
all
he
says.
wouldn't
that
be
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
the
question
is
the
motivation
for
his
decision
to
bring
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
says
i...
i
would
have
brought
it
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
did
in
the
armstrong--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
in
the
race
context,
it
is
a
dismissal
of
the
prosecution
itself.
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
harlow
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
one
question
justice
o'connor
asked
you
earlier?
to
what
extent
are
there...
is
there
precedent
out
there
in
other
courts
that
have
decided
this
very
issue?
are
there...
is
there
precedent
for
what
you're
asking
us
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
a
violation
of
first
amendment
rights
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and...
and
were
those
cases
in
which
the
prosecution
itself
was
brought
to
a
halt,
or
were
they
post
prosecution
damage
actions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
conviction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
any
precedent
for
a
damage
action
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
not
quite.
bivens
isn't
exactly
like
that.
this
is
fourth
amendment.
so
is
there...
is
there
precedent
for
a
damage
action
brought
on
the
theory
that
the
prosecution
was
brought
for...
to
retaliate
for
first
amendment
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
maybe
i
should
ask
mr.
kneedler.
but
i
am
correct
in
assuming
that
even
if
you
should
lose
on
the
issue
that
we're
faced
with
today,
the
case
would,
nevertheless,
go
forward
because
you
would
still
seek
to
prove
an
absence
of
probable
cause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
case
wouldn't
be
over
if
you
lose
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
mccartan.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
