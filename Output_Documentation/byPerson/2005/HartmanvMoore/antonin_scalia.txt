justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
willing
to
acknowledge...
and...
and
the
government
concedes
that
you
can
have
a
different
standard
when
the...
the
basis
for
the
selective
prosecution
happens
to
violate
the
constitution
from
the
standard
you
apply
where
the
basis
for
the
selective
prosecution
doesn't
violate
the
constitution,
such
as
i'm
prosecuting
him
because
he
was
mean
to
my
brother
in
law.
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
apply
a
different
standard
there
than
you
would
apply
where...
where
the
reason
is
some
first
amendment
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
would
you
answer
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
a
different
criterion...
you...
you
say
it's
going
to
be
different
for
the
first
amendment
and
the...
and...
and
the
equal
protection
clause,
at
least
where
race
is
involved.
what
if
there's
no
constitutional
violation
at
all,
but
i
just
selectively
prosecute
him
just
because
i
don't
like
this
guy
or
because
he
was
mean
to
a
relative
of
mine?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
going
to
be
a
different
standard--
justice
antonin
scalia
--exactly,
and
would
you
apply
a
different
standard
because
there
isn't
a
constitutional
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
the
defendant
here
is
not
the
prosecutor.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
someone
who
provided
information
to
the
prosecutor
that...
that
was
erroneous
and
allegedly
maliciously
motivated.
justice
antonin
scalia
allegedly
maliciously
motivated,
at
least.
i
don't
understand
how
you
would
apply
the
test,
would...
you
know,
would
you
have
prosecuted
anyway,
when...
you
know,
but
for
the
malicious
motive,
when
the
person
you're...
you're
suing
is
not
the
prosecutor.
it
wasn't
up
to
this
person
whether
there
would
be
a
prosecution.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccartan,
how
does...
how
does
your
standard
work?
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
kneedler.
the...
the
test
you
would
propose
is
whether
but
for
the
retaliatory
motive,
the
prosecution
would
have
been
brought
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
think
they
would
say
absolute
immunity,
not
qualified.
i...
i
think
they're
saying
if
there's
probable
cause,
the
game
is
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
wasn't
addressing...
this
wasn't...
didn't
involve
prosecution,
though.
it
didn't
involve
unlawful
prosecution.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
was
a
suit
against
a
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but...
but
we
treat
prosecutions
quite
differently.
we
do
not
give,
for
example,
absolute
immunity
to
the
wardens
of
prisons
as
we
give
absolute
immunity
to
prosecutors.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
specially
dangerous
area
in
which
to
allow
litigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccartan,
i...
i
still
don't
entirely
understand
what
you
would
want
the
government
to
prove
under
your
system
in
order
to...
in
order
to...
to
win
this
case.
they
would
have
to
prove
what?
that...
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
would
not
be
enough
to
show
that
the
prosecution
would
have
gone
forward
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see
now
in...
in
the
employment
cases
where...
where
somebody
is
dismissed
for
a...
a
racially
discriminatory
reason
and...
and
you
have
to
prove
that
the
same
action
would
have
been
taken
anyway,
you
ask
the
person
who
fired
them
with
the
discriminatory
motive
whether
that
person
would
have
taken
that
action
anyway.
whereas
here,
the
person
who
brought
the
prosecution
is
not
in
this
case.
it's
somebody
who
gave
information
to
the
prosecutor.
i
don't
know
how
that
person
could...
could
possibly
establish
that
the
prosecution
would
have
been
brought
anyway.
it
wasn't
up
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
had
nothing
to
do
with--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
think
the
defendant
can
subpoena
the
prosecutor?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
thought
the
prosecutor
had
absolute
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
he...
he
can't
be
brought
into
court
to
defend
his
own...
his
own
judgment,
but
he
can
be
brought
into
court
when...
when
an
investigator
is
sued
in...
in
order
to
take
his
testimony
as
to
what
would
have
happened?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
may
have
done
it
voluntarily
here,
but
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
he
could
be
subpoenaed,
when...
when
he
has
absolute
immunity
from
suit
against
himself,
to
testify
in
a
suit
against
somebody
else.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
kind
of
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well...
well,
surely
the
prosecution--
justice
antonin
scalia
--surely
the
prosecution
would
go
ahead
if
there
were
probable
cause.
no?
i
mean,
suppose
it
was
brought
up
during
the
prosecution.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
to
say
if
there
was...
if
there
was
perfect
probable
cause
for
the
prosecution,
that
you
can
stop
the
prosecution
in
its
tracks
by...
by
an
allegation
of
the
first
amendment
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccartan,
what
was
the
1887
case
or
1880--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
you
said
armstrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
because
the
prosecutor
could
have
gotten
a
lot
of
other
information
from
other
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
not
going
to
throw
out
the
prosecution
just
because
this
one
piece
of
information
was
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
neither...
neither
does
absolute
immunity
for
the
prosecutor
distinguish
between
whether
the
prosecutor
was
acting
just
illegally
or
just
acting
unconstitutionally.
i
mean,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
apply
the
same
rule
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
your...
your
point
that...
that
there...
there
has
to
be
a
difference
between
whether
there's
a
constitutional
violation
or
not
in
this
context
seems
to
me
not
well
taken
because
we
don't
make
that
distinction
in
the
context
of
giving
absolute
immunity
to
the
prosecutor.
we
don't
say
he
doesn't
have
absolute
immunity
when...
when
he's
been
guilty
of
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
worry
a
lot
about
that,
mr.--
