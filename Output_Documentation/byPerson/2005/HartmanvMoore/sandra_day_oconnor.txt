the
case
that
comes
closest,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
is
probably
united
states
v.
armstrong,
and
in
that
case,
this
court
said
in
the
ordinary
case,
so
long
as
the
prosecutor
has
probable
cause
to
believe
the
offense
was
committed,
the
decision
to
prosecute
or
go
before
a
grand
jury
rests
entirely
in
his
discretion.
but,
of
course,
the
discretion
is
subject
to
constitutional
constraints,
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause.
the
decision
whether
to
prosecute
may
not
be
based
on
an
unjustifiable
standard
such
as
race,
religion,
or
other
arbitrary
classification.
and
the
standard
the
court
articulated
there
was
the
defendant
must
present
clear
evidence--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
the
contrary.
now,
that's
different
from
your
proposition
of
probable
cause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
based
on
race.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
should
that
be
different
than
the
first
amendment
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
this
court
opens
that
door,
don't
you
think
we
might
see
a
different
problem?
