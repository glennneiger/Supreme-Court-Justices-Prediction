mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
respondent
alleges
in
this
bivens
action
that
petitioners,
who
were
postal
inspectors,
caused
him
to
be
prosecuted
in
retaliation
for
activity
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
in
order
to
make
out
such
a
claim,
however,
respondent
must
establish
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
prosecution.
that
is
so
for
three
mutually
reinforcing
reasons.
first,
that
requirement
accords
with
the
deference
this
court
has
consistently
held
in
armstrong
and
other
cases
must
be
given
to
the
prosecutorial
function
because
that
function
is
core
to
the
executive
branch's
operations
and
because
prosecutorial
decision
making
is
ill
suited
to
judicial
second
guessing.
second,
that
rule
accords
a...
an
important
objective
screen
and
check
against
claims
of
retaliatory
prosecution
in
order
to
guard
against
the
chilling
effect
that
would
otherwise
routinely
arise
from
inquiry
into
the
subjective
motivations
of
those
involved
in
the
prosecutorial
decision
making
process.
and
third,
that
rule
is
deeply
rooted
in
history.
a
claim
of
first
amendment
retaliatory
prosecution
is
but
one
species
of
a
claim
of
malicious
prosecution,
and
it
has
long
been
required
that
an
essential
element
of
a
claim
of
malicious
prosecution
is
that
the
plaintiff
show
an
absence
of
probable
cause
for
the
prosecution.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the...
the
first
amendment...
the
alleged
first
amendment
retaliation
describes
the
malice,
a
form
of
the
malice
that
would
arise
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
to
be
sure,
what
renders
it
malice
or
wrongful
is
the
first
amendment,
but...
but
the
derivation
of...
of
the
reason
for
why
it's
wrongful
does
not,
i
think,
detract
from
the
essential
relevance
of
the
tort
of
malicious
prosecution.
and
if...
if
i
may
add
to
that,
the...
the
reason
why
the...
the
tort
of
malicious
prosecution
is
highly
relevant
here
is
not
simply
because
on
the
malice
side
of
it,
but
also
because
it
has
long
been
recognized,
beginning
with
blackstone
before
the
first
amendment
and
the
constitution
were
even
adopted,
that
there
are
critical
interests
on
the
other
side,
not
simply
the
defendant's
interests
in
avoiding
badly
motivated
prosecutions,
but
the
important
countervailing
public
interest
of
ensuring
that
wrongdoers
are
brought
to
justice
and
that
those
who
have
information
about
it
will
come
forward.
and...
and
that
was
recognized
by
blackstone
early
on
and
has
been
recognized
consistent...
consistently
by
this
court
in...
in
many,
many
decisions,
including
recent
cases
of
this
court
involving
immunity
issues,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
specifically
recognizing
that
the
tort
of
malicious
prosecution
is
very
instructive
in
deciding
how
rules
should
be
applied
when
a
bivens
action
or
a
1983
action
is
brought
in
the
specific
context
of
prosecution.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in...
in
terms...
in
terms
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
prosecutor,
there--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that...
that
should
not...
that
should
not
be
a...
a
selection
criterion
in
itself,
but
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i...
i
would
think
ordinarily
yes,
but
with
this
caveat.
unlike
race
which
is
never
relevant
to
the
prosecutorial
decision
making
process,
there
can
often
be
a
prosecution...
and
this
case
is
one
of
them...
in
which
you
might
have
claims
of
public
corruption.
and...
and
in
fact,
there
was
a
guilty
plea
here
on
the
part
of
a
member
of
the
postal
service
board
of
directors
for
receiving
payments
to...
for
his
activity
on
behalf
of
respondent's
corporation
and
others.
this...
this...
involving
contracts
for
$250
million.
this
was
a
very,
very
important
procurement
by
the
post
office
department
and
it
is
understandable
that
in
connection
with
that
prosecution,
the
prosecutors
and
the
postal
service
investigators
would
look
into
issues
of
respondent's,
or
people
in
his
behalf,
approaching
the
government.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there...
there
are
certain
restrictions...
certainly
restrictions
on
what
the
prosecutor
may
do,
but
several
points
about
that.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
bivens
action
against
the
prosecutor.
the
prosecutor
is
absolutely
immune
from
suit.
the
prosecutor's
decision
making
process
is...
is,
in
fact,
as
is
the
grand
jury's,
a...
a
critical
protection
against
malicious
prosecution--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the...
the
question
is
whether
in
that
circumstance
the...
the
bivens
plaintiff,
the
criminal
defendant,
has
a
first
amendment
right
to
be
excused
from
prosecution
or,
after
the
prosecution
is
unsuccessful,
to
bring
a
civil
action,
whether
he
has
a
right
not
to
have
been
prosecuted
in
those
circumstances
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
probable
cause
and
the
independent
judgment
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
does...
he
does
not
have
a...
he
does
not
have
a
first
amendment
claim
in
those
circumstances
where
there
is
probable
cause
for
the
violation.
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
does
not
have
a
first
amendment
right
not
to
be
singled
out
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would
not.
i...
i'm
not...
i'm
not
endorsing
the
motivation.
what
i'm...
what
i'm
saying
is
what
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
i...
i'm
not
disputing
that
it...
that...
that
a...
a
prosecution
should
not
be
brought
or
should
not
be
heard--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
it
is...
we
certainly
disagree
with
that
with
our
proposition.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
for...
for
purposes
of
our
probable...
probable
cause
claim,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that...
that
is
true,
but
that,
of
course,
was
also
true
at
common
law
for...
for
malicious
prosecution.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
at
common
law...
at
common
law,
yes.
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
reformulating
the
common
law
principles
of...
of
immunity,
the...
the
public
prosecutor
now
has
absolute
immunity
under...
under
these--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
these
court's...
under
this
court's
decisions.
but
at
common
law,
the
prosecutor
did
have
the
protection
of
malicious
prosecution,
and
as
justice
scalia
observed
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
kalina
decision,
the
elements
of
a
tort
of
prosecution
essentially
had
a
built
in
qualified
immunity,
and
the
probable
cause
requirement
was
essentially
that.
it
afforded
protection
for
the
prosecutor.
the...
the
private
citizen
who...
who...
the
complaining
witness...
he
could
not
be
the
subject
of
a
suit
for
damages
if...
if
the
charges
were
dismissed,
not
simply
upon
a
showing...
it
required
more
than
simply
a
showing
of
malice.
it
required
a
showing
of
an
absence
of
probable
cause
for
reasons
that
are
essentially
identical
to
the
qualified
immunity
and
absolute
immunity...
the...
the
reasons
for
qualified
immunity
and
absolute
immunity.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but...
but
on...
on
the...
on
the
governmental
interest
side
of
the
balance,
the
interests
are
exactly
the
same
in
both...
in
both
circumstances.
and
that
is
not
to
chill...
not...
not
to
create
circumstances
where
people
would
hold
back
from
coming
forward
with
information
of
violations
of
the
law
because
of
fear
that
they
would
be
sued
and
retaliated
against
afterward.
and
that
hasn't
changed
now
that
we
have
public
prosecutors.
it's
still
critical.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
at...
at
common
law
under
the
tort
of
malicious
prosecution,
the
indictment
created
a
presumption
because
an
indictment
does
have
to
depend
upon
probable
cause,
and
under
the...
under
this
court's
decision
in
gerstein
v.
pugh
and
other
decisions,
that
can't
be
reexamined
by
the
court
in
the
prosecution.
but
at
common
law,
the...
the
indictment
created
a
presumption
that
was
subject
to
rebuttal
by
the...
by
the
civil
plaintiff.
there
was
some
disagreement
about
what
would
be
necessary,
whether
you
would
have
to
show
fraud
on
the
grand
jury
or
whether
you
could
just
retry--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
we
do
not...
we
do
not
think
that
the
existence
of
the
grand...
it
has
not
been
our
position
that
the
existence
of
the
indictment
is
dispositive
and
cannot
be
challenged,
but
we
do
think
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we...
we
think
in
a...
in
a...
it
would
have
to
show
by
at
least
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
maybe
a
clear
showing,
that
there
was
not
probable
cause.
and
i
think
that
also
ties
in
to
the...
to
the
standard
for
qualified
immunity,
which
is
could
a
reasonable
person
in
those
circumstances
have
believed
that
there
was
probable
cause.
i
think,
if
the
grand
jury
returns
an
indictment,
that
that
should
be
pretty
persuasive
evidence
but
not
compelling
evidence...
i
mean,
not
dispositive
evidence
that
there
was
probable
cause.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
clear
evidence,
and
the
court
stressed
that
it
was
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i...
i
think
several
things
may
explain
that.
in
armstrong,
that
was
a
claim
of
selective
prosecution
that
was
brought--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--based
on
race.
that
was
one
of
the
distinctions
i
was
going
to
point
to.
and
secondly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as...
as
this
court's
decision
in...
in
johnson,
for
example,
shows,
there...
distinctions
based
on
race
are
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
no
matter
what
the
context,
in
that
case
even
in
the
prison
context,
whereas
first
amendment
claims
often
take
account
of
the
context
in
which
they
are
raised.
for
example,
this
court
in
the
american
arab
anti
discrimination
case
held
that
there
would...
could
be
no
claim
at
all
of
selective
prosecution
in
the
immigration
context
because
of
the
important
countervailing
interest
in
enforcing
the
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
no.
the...
the
other
distinction...
and...
and
i'm
not
sure
if
this
goes
to
your
point
or
not.
the
other
distinction
is
that
in
armstrong
the
claim
was
made
in
the
criminal
prosecution
itself.
here,
the
claim
is
the
civil
action
after
the
criminal
prosecution
is
over
with,
and
it's
in
that...
in
that
context
especially
that
the
analogy
to
malicious
prosecution
is
very
strong
and
why
the
element
of...
that
the
person
has
to...
that
the...
there
has
to
have
been
a
favorable
termination
for
the...
for
the
plaintiff
and
there
has
to
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
i...
maybe...
i
guess
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
don't...
i
don't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
there...
there
wouldn't
be
any...
any
constitutional
claim
and
any...
any
common
law--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
there
wouldn't
be
any
claim
at
all.
i
mean,
there
wouldn't
be
any
basis
for
a
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there...
there...
and
in
the...
in
the
federal
sphere,
if
there
was
a
malicious...
a
common
law
malicious
prosecution
claim,
that
would
have
to
be
brought
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
against
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
yes.
i...
i
am...
i
am
saying
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--oh...
oh,
it
does
because
the...
because
the...
the
first...
the
existence
of
the
first
amendment
claim
is
what
gives
you
the
bivens
cause
of
action
in
the
first
place.
so
otherwise,
there
wouldn't
be
any
federal
cause
of
action
at
all
without...
without
the
first
amendment
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
because...
and...
and
again,
this...
this
is...
this
is
because
of
the...
of
the
background
of
the
common
law
tort
of
malicious
prosecution,
which
strikes
exactly
the
balance
that
i...
that
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the...
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
my
understanding
from...
from
reading
the
treatises
on...
on
malicious
prosecution,
for
example,
that
there
has
been
no
watering
down
of
the
probable
cause
requirement
because
it
is
understood
to
be
a
critical
check
against--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i'm...
i'm
focusing
on
the
tort
of
malicious
prosecution
which
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--which--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm
not...
i'm
not
aware...
i'm
not
aware
that
any
jurisdiction
has
done
that.
but
in
response
to
your
proposal,
the...
the...
what...
what's
wrong
with
that
is
that
it
would
allow
extensive
inquiry,
discovery,
other
inquiry
into
the
subjective
motivations
of
persons
involved
in
the
decision
making
process
with
no
mechanism
analogous
to
immunity
or
the...
or
the
probable
cause
criterion
to
weed
out--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there...
there
was
much,
much
more
evidence.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
for
one
thing,
it's
absolutely
conceded
that
there
was
a
conspiracy.
three
people
pleaded
guilty,
including--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the...
it
isn't
all
about
other
people.
the...
the...
that
crime
included...
and
it's
accepted
in
this
case
that
the
postal
service
board
of...
board
member
accepted
30
percent
of
the
fees
paid
by
respondent's
company
to
the
consulting
firm.
respondent's
company.
he
was
the
chief
executive
officer.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
in...
in
the
summer
of
1984,
before
there
was
even
a
consulting
agreement,
there
was
a
series
of
conversations
between
voss,
the
postal
board
board
member,
and
respondent,
including
one
for
which
there
are
notes
in
which
voss
said
i
am
working
for
you.
there...
there
was
an...
there
is
an
abundance
of
evidence
involving
reedy
who
is...
no.
i...
i
know,
but
just
in...
just
in
terms
of...
just
in
terms
of
the
sequence.
there
is
evidence
that
voss
and
moore
were
good
friends.
voss
said
that
he
had
a
close
relationship
with
respondent,
and
when
the
contract
was
first
being
negotiated,
reedy
acknowledged
that
voss
and
moore
were
good
friends.
they
had
a
close
relationship.
they
were
not
distant.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
although
i...
i
certainly
do
not
want
to
leave
the
misimpression
that...
and
there
is...
there
is
much
more.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that...
that...
you
do
not
have...
you
do
not
have
to
decide
it,
but
i
would
certainly
urge
the
court
not
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
or
make
any
comments
that
there
is
because
there
were...
there
were--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
that
is
their
position.
and
that
position
accords...
yes,
that
is
their
position.
and
that
accords
no
particular--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--what
is
very
different
is
that
this
is
the
prosecutorial
function.
as
this
court
recognized
in
armstrong,
that
is
a
core
executive
branch
function
and
it
is
one
that
the
courts
are
ill
suited
to
second
guess
because
a
whole
variety
of
determinations
can
enter
into
whether
to
prosecute
somebody,
whether
they...
whether
the
particular
conduct...
how
culpable
the
person
is,
whether
the
conduct
fits
into
the
overall
prosecutorial
priorities,
whether
there
will
be
cooperating
witnesses,
what...
what
the
office's
resources
are.
there
are
a
whole
bunch
of...
of
judgments
that
courts
are
ill
suited
to
second
guess,
and
it
would
be
very
chilling
if
the
prosecutor
had
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well...
oh,
not...
we
do
not
think
there
is
strong
evidence
of
retaliatory
motive.
and
i...
i
can...
can
address
that,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we...
we
think
the
more
direct...
i
don't
think
so
for...
partly
for
the
reason
that
i...
that
i
gave
to
justice
breyer
is
that...
that
that
would
not
protect
against
discovery
and...
and
the
sort
of
chilling
inquiry
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
its
immunity
cases,
and
especially
in
the
prosecutorial
function
where
the
prosecutor
would
be
required
to
disclose.
even
though
the
prosecutor
is
absolutely
immune,
the
prosecutor's
decision
making
process
and
his
communication
with
law
enforcement
agents
would...
would
be
exposed
for
judicial
scrutiny,
public
scrutiny
in
a
way
that
could
chill
the
prosecutorial
function.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
erroneous.
it
was
allegedly
maliciously
motivated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that's
a...
i
think
that's
a
very
important
point,
and
before
a...
a
court
enters
into
that,
in
the
end,
unknowable
question,
maybe
a
court
can...
can,
in
the
end,
determine
probabilities,
but
before
a
court
undertakes
that,
which
requires
looking
not
simply
at
the
motivation
of
the...
of
the
law
enforcement
officers,
but
the
prosecutor
and...
and
who
knows
whether
the
grand
jury
would
have
returned
an
indictment,
and
yet
a
court
certainly
couldn't
be
expected
to
inquire
into
that.
now,
so
we...
we
think
that
that's
another
reason
why
the
probable
cause
requirement
is
a
critical
gateway
before
a
court
is...
is
going
to
enter
into
that
determination.
and
all...
and
it's
important
to
remember
it's
not
just
proving
the
question
of
causation,
but
these
are
people
who
are
several
steps
removed
from
the...
from
the
prosecutorial
decision.
and
the...
and
the
personal
liability
would
be
visited
on
the
law
enforcement
agents
who
were
doing
their
job
and
cooperating
with
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
this
case
was...
this
case
got
attention
at
the
highest
levels
of
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
the
u.s.
attorney
personally
met
with
the...
the
respondent...
lawyers
for
respondent.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
accept
that
because
there's
no
factual
determinations
to
that
effect.
there...
there
are
really
just
two
snippets
of
evidence
that
are
primarily
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
view
that
there
was
a
retaliatory
motive
here.
and
they
were...
they
were
really
observations
that
the...
that
the
inspectors
made
to...
to
show...
the
first
one
was
why
the
corporation
should
be
indicted,
not
just...
not
just
moore,
but
why
the
corporation
should
be
indicted.
and
it
was
just
an
observation
that
the
corporation,
through
its
agents,
was
involved
in
a
lot
of
activities
and
should
be
held
accountable.
it
was
not...
it
was
not
evidence
of
a...
of
a
retaliatory
motive,
and
there
were
subpoenas
for...
for
documents
about
political
contributions.
but
let's
remember
that
this
was
a
case
involving
bribery
of
a
public
official,
and
it
was...
it
was
understandable
that
the
ausa
and
the...
and
the
inspectors
would...
would
look
to
see
whether
there
was
money
directed
elsewhere.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
i'd
like
to
respond
to
justice
breyer's
suggestion
that
this
could
all
be
solved
by
an
application
of
the
harlow
qualified
immunity
standard.
with
all
respect,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
really
work
at
all
because
if...
if
the
point
is
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
bring
a
prosecution
only
because
of
protected
first
amendment
activity,
that
could
be
taken
as
a
given
and
still
be
enormous
inquiry
into
what
actually
happened
between
the
investigator
and
the
prosecutor,
what
the
real
motivation
was,
what
the
prosecution's
policies
were.
that
is
the
concern
we
have
for
the
post
hoc
inquiry
into
the
process.
and
not
only
that,
it
isn't
just
the
discovery.
it's
what...
what
consequences
this
will
have
on
law
enforcement
generally
if
police
officers
operate
under
the
assumption
that
if
the
prosecution
fails,
they
will
be
subject
to
civil
liability,
which
is
exactly
what
blackstone
said,
as
this
court
quoted
in
dinsman
v.
wilkes.
the
reason
for
the
rule
is
that
it
would
be
a
very
great
discouragement
to
public
justice
if
prosecutors,
who
have
a
tolerable
ground
of
suspicion,
were
liable
to
be
sued
at
law
whenever
their
indictments
miscarried.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but...
but
that
included
complaining
witnesses.
that...
that
was
what
prosecutor
meant
at
common...
at
common
law.
and
there's
no
reason
to
grope
for
some
sort
of
screen
because
the
common
law
furnishes
it.
the
tort
of
malicious
prosecution
is
what
this
court
relied
upon
in
heck
v.
humphrey
for
the
favorable
termination
rule,
that
you
could
not
bring
a
1983
suit
unless
the
conviction
had
been
set
aside
and
the
proceeding
was
terminated
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
that
same
tort,
that
tort
of
malicious
prosecution,
contains
the
probable
cause
requirement
to
guard
against
an
objective
screen,
to
guard
against
the
very
thing
that
blackstone
was
worried
about
and
that
this
court
noticed
in...
in
the
dinsman
case.
and
that
is,
that
it
is
important
not
to
have
law
enforcement
officers
be
chilled
from
the
important
function
of
furnishing
information
to
prosecutors.
and
this
court's
decision
in
armstrong
imposed
an
important
objective
test
that
you
have
to
show
that
there's
somebody
similarly
situated
before
you
even
inquire
into
prosecutorial
motives.
you
have
to
show
an
objective
factor
that
someone
else
was
similarly
situated.
respondent's
position
would
offer
no
such...
no
such
protection.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
at...
at
common
law...
and
i
think
this
was
an
important
insight.
at
common
law,
it
was
not
even
evidence
of
the
absence
of
probable
cause
because
a
judgment
of
acquittal
turns
on
the
determination
that
a
fact
finder...
a
reasonable
fact
finder
could
not
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
had
actually
committed
the
crime.
probable
cause
is
a
very
different
standard,
which
is
whether
it
would
lead
a
reasonable,
cautious,
prudent
person
to
believe
that
a
crime
had
been
committed.
that
is
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--an
acquittal
does
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but
my...
my
point
was
at
common
law,
that
the
wisdom
of
the
courts
was
that...
that
that
wasn't
even
evidence
of
a...
that
should...
that...
that
shouldn't
allow
the
suit
to
go
forward
because
it
was
a
sufficient
guard...
protection
for
the
prosecutors.
