justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
any
one
of
the
three
questions,
would
that
end
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it's
possible,
at
least,
that
we
just
overlooked
that
aspect
in
the
issuance
of
our
opinion,
would
it
be
more
helpful
to
move
on
to
the
other
two
questions
at
issue
here,
since
they
would
be
determinative?
it's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it's
disturbing
to
think
that
some
court
below
deliberately
was
trying
to
defy
what
this
court
said.
and
i'm
not
sure
there
is
any
indication
of
that.
it
may
have
thought
that
those
issues...
those
other
acts
were
overlooked,
and,
therefore,
they
had
some
right
to
deal
with
it.
but
i
wonder
if
we
shouldn't
focus
on
the
other
two
legal
issues
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
tell
us
what...
which
one
of
these
questions,
in
your
view,
we
ought
to
address,
first
and
foremost?
if
the
answer
to
any
of
them
is
favorable
to
petitioner's
position,
i
guess
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
no,
because
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
counsel
for
the
government
explained
that
if,
in
the
course
of
committing
a
robbery,
some
bystander
is
physically
injured,
it's
covered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
understandable,
isn't
it?
