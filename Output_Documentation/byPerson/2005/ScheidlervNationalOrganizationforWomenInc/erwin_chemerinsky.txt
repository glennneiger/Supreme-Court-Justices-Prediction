mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
seventh
circuit
did
exactly
the
right
thing
in
this
case.
it
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
and
asked
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
an
injunction
could
remain,
based
on
the
four
counts
of
physical
violence
and
threats
of
violence,
and
asked
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
hobbs
act
applies
to
physical
violence
and
threats
of
violence
apart
from
extortion
and
robbery.
this
made
great
sense.
no
court,
in
this
long
litigation,
had
yet
discussed
the
meaning
of
the
hobbs
act
and
whether
it
applies
to
physical
violence
and
threats
of
violence
apart
from
extortion
and
robbery.
there's
already
been
a
good
deal
of
discussion
about
what
this
court
meant
in
its
prior
decision.
i
think
you
find
clarification
if
you
look
at
page
399
of
your
prior
decision,
where
the
court
lists
the
predicate
acts
that
it
was
considering.
and
if
you
add
up
the
numbers,
it
adds
to
117
predicate
acts,
but
if
you
go
to
the
jury's
verdict,
the
special
interrogatories,
they
found
121
acts.
what
was
omitted
from
the
supreme
court's
listing
last
time
were
the
four
counts
of
physical
violence
and
threats
of
violence
in
violation
of
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
what
this
court
did
was
reverse
and
remand
for
further
consideration,
consistent
with
the
decision
of
this
court.
since
this
court
had
not
considered
the--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but
this
court
has
been
clear
that
it
only
decides
the
issues
that
it
speaks
to.
it's
not
plausible,
your
honor,
that
this
court
was
deciding
a
major
unresolved
issue
of
federal
criminal
law
without
ever
speaking
to
the
question--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--except,
your
honor,
this
court
has
said
that
it
doesn't
decide
issues
that
weren't
presented
to
it.
and
if
you
look
at
page
397--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
rehearing
is
to
issues
that
were
decided
by
this
court.
this
court
clearly
did
not
speak
to
the
meaning
of
the
hobbs
act.
and
so,
it
was
completely
appropriate
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
say
that
this
court
considered
the
issues,
in
terms
of
what
extortion
was
about,
whether
the
injunction
is
permissible
under
civil
rico.
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
your
honor,
it's
not
required
to
present
it
that
way.
and
i
think
what's
incorrect
about
your
phrasing
is,
it
was
petitioners
that
did
not
present
this.
it
was
the
same
petitioners
last
time.
they
presented
to
this
court
the
questions
as
to
the
meaning
of
rico.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
page
397
of
your
prior
decision,
it
clearly
states
that
there
were
two
issues
presented,
what
rico.
i
think
it
was
completely
appropriate,
then,
for
respondents
to
say
this
court
didn't
deal
with
the
four
issues
in...
concerning
whether
violence
and
threats
of
violence
are
separately
from
the
hobbs
act.
and
it
was
then
permissible
to
say
to
the
seventh
circuit,
"these
remain
as
a
basis
for
relief.
"
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
if
this
court
had
entered
judgment
for
petitioners,
which
it
could
have,
then
you
would
be
correct.
but,
instead,
what
this
court
did,
as
i
said,
is
reverse
and
remand
for
consideration.
and
the
seventh
circuit--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
typically
you
don't.
but
it
is
certainly
permissible
and
possible
for
this
court
to
do
so.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
other
than,
of
course,
as
a
court,
this
court
obviously
could
enter
judgment
for
petitioners.
the
fact
that
this
court
said--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
the
court
could
certainly,
and,
more
likely,
would
do
what
you
say.
it
could
also
affect
the
judgment--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
right.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
and
my
only
point
is,
since
this
court
clearly
said
it
was
dealing
with
117
of
the
acts,
and
clearly
did
not
mention
the
four
counts
of
violence
and
threats
of
violence
under
the
hobbs
act--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--that's
right.
and
the
question,
of
course,
is,
what
does
"all"
refer
to
here?
and
i
would
say,
if
you
go
back
to
page
399,
it
lists
the
predicate
acts
that
it's
referring
to
and
there--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--117--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
your
honor--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
chief
justice
roberts,
then
the
assumption
would
have
to
be
that
this
court
was
deciding
the
four
counts,
in
terms
of
violence
and
threats
of
violence,
even
though
it
wasn't
presented
in
the
cert
petition,
even
though
it
wasn't
briefed,
and
even
though
it
was
never
discussed
in
this
court's
opinion.
and
i
think
it
was
quite
logical
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
say
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
to
let
the
district
court
decide
whether
any
injunctive
relief
was
appropriate,
based
on
those
four
counts;
and,
if
so,
what
that
provision
of
the
hobbs
act
means.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
reason
why
this
case
should
go
back
to
the
district
court,
because
that's
the
judge
who
tried
the
case.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but
the
judge
presided
over
the
jury
trial,
and
the
judge
could
identify
if
there
were
four
acts
of
violence
and
threats
of
violence
to
obstruct
interstate
commerce.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but,
justice
ginsburg,
he
doesn't
need
to
know
which
four.
what
he
needs
to
determine
is,
did
the
record
that
was
presented
to
the
jury
support
the
finding
that
there
were
four
acts
of
violence
and
threats
of
violence?
and
we'd
suggest
that--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but
the
traditional
rule
is
to
interpret
the
jury's
verdict
in
a
way
that's
most
favorable
to
its
conclusion.
and
so,
here
what
the
judge
has
to
decide
is,
based
on
the
record,
were
there
four
acts
of
violence
or
threats
of
violence
to
obstruct
interstate
commerce?
and
we'd
suggest
it
would
be
quite
easy
for
the
judge
to
identify
four
such
acts.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
of
course,
but--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but
the
jury--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
your
honor,
the
jury
did
find,
in
special
interrogatory
4(e),
that
there
was
violence
and
threats
of
violence
and
if...
to
obstruct
interstate
commerce.
also
here,
remember
the
judge
held
a
separate
hearing
after
the
jury
verdict,
before
issuing
injunction.
and
if,
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
he
heard
during
the
trial
in
that
special
hearing,
he
found
four
acts
of
violence
and
threats
of
violence,
he
then
has
to
decide
what
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate.
and,
of
course,
he
would
also,
consistent--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
since
this
is
an
injunction,
he
is
allowed
to
consider
the
evidence
that
he
heard,
since
he
was
sitting
in
an
equitable
matter.
and
so,
there
were
actually
two
presentations--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--well,
when
it
comes
to
injunctive
relief,
the
judge
can
hold
a
separate
hearing,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
and
i
believe
the
issue
for
the
judge
on
remand
would
be,
were
there
four
acts
of
violence
or
threats
of
violence
to
obstruct
interstate
commerce?
and
i
think
the
record
clearly
indicates
there
were.
the
judge
said,
here,
"there
is
enough
evidence,
to
fill
this
courtroom,
of
illegal
acts
by
the
respondents.
"
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
why
it
was
appropriate
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court,
because
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
an
injunction
is
not
appropriate,
then
anything
that
would
be
said
about
the
meaning
of
the
hobbs
act
or
about
civil
rico
would
then
just
be
an
advisory
opinion.
and
that's
why
this
court,
we
believe,
should
also
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court.
but
if
it
reaches
the
meaning
of
the
hobbs
act
or
civil
rico,
we
believe
that
this
is
a
situation
there
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
clearly
controls.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
yes,
your
honor.
the
nature
of
the
relief
is
certainly
different
under
the
hobbs
act
than
under
the
face
act.
also,
of
course,
at
the
time
this
action
was
brought,
19
years
ago,
the
face
act
didn't
exist.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
thank
you.
and
i'll
address
them,
first
and
then
second.
as
to
the
first
point,
you
correctly
quote
the
1946
statute,
but
the
1948
revision
was
approved
by
congress,
and
it
specifically
says
"robbery
or
extortion
or
attempts
so
to
do.
"
comma,
"or
physical
violence
or
threats
of
violence.
"
this
court
has
said,
in
cases
like
united
states
versus
ron
pair,
that
commas
have
to
be
given
meaning.
this
court,
in
many
cases,
such
as
fcc
versus
pacifica,
said,
"or"
must
be
given
meaning.
there
is--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
your
honor...
the
statute
has
been
approved
by
congress.
it
is
that
which
is
authoritative.
and
this
court
has
said,
in
other
cases,
like
united
states
versus
wells,
and
state
farm
versus
tashire,
that
revisors
notes
are
often
erroneous.
this
court
has
said
the
cardinal
rule
of
statutory
construction
is
that
the
plain
language
must
be
followed.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
right.
this...
my
argument
is
that
the
plain
language
makes
clear
that
congress
did
enact
a
substantive
change.
and,
indeed,
to
interpret
the
law
as
petitioner
suggests,
would
render
the
words
about
"physical
violence
or
threats
of
violence.
"
as
mere
surplusage.
and
so,
for
example,
some
of
the
illustrations
that
were
mentioned
earlier,
one
was
about
the
possibility
of
a
planned
pride
and
attempt.
but,
in
a
model
penal
code,
section
5.01,
it's
clear
that
any
substantial
step
is
sufficient
for
an
attempt
that--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--i
mention
the
model
penal
code
as
just
something
that's
regarded
as
an
authoritative
definition
with
regard
to
criminal
law.
there's
many
jurisdictions
around
the
country,
including
at
the
federal
level,
consistently
saying
a
substantial
step
is
sufficient
for
an
attempt.
another
example
that
was
mentioned
was
the
subordinate
enforcer.
would
the
subordinate
enforcer
would
be
likely
considered
part
of
a
conspiracy
or
an
accomplice?
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
there
is
almost
no
legislative
history
for
the
1948
revision.
all
there
is,
as
you
rightly
say,
is
the
revisor's
notes.
but
this
court
has
said
that
the
revisor's
notes
are
not
authoritative.
and
this
court
has
said,
on
so
many
occasions,
that--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes.
but
even
if
that's
regarded
as
authoritative,
this
court
has
so
often
said
legislative
history
cannot
justify
ignoring
plain
meaning.
and,
given
the
comma
and
the
word
"or"
and
the
fact
that,
otherwise,
the
words
"by
physical
violence"
would
have
no
meaning--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--that's
the
plain
meaning.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
two
points
here.
first,
it
says
"a
plan".
it's
clear,
there
is...
it's
a
plan
to
obstruct,
interfere,
or
affect
commerce.
the
others,
your
honor,
you
quickly
skipped
over--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
does
deprive
the
comma
or
the
word
"or"
meaning.
and,
in
fact,
it
deprives
the
title
of
meaning,
because
the
title
here
can
be
used
when
the
title
makes
clear
that
it's
about
violence
to
obstruct
interstate
commerce.
i'd
also
point
out
some
words--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor.
here,
what
it's
saying
is
that
congress
is
prohibiting
"plans
to
obstruct
commerce
by
robbery
or
extortion
or
physical
violence
or
threats
of
violence.
"
and,
justice
scalia,
when
you
read
the
statute
to
me,
some
of
the
words
that
were
skipped
over
quickly
were
the
words
"so
to
do".
notice
it
says
"with
regard
to
robbery
or
extortion
or
attempts
to
do
so.
"
comma.
if
they
meant
violence
and
physical
violence
to
only
refer
to
extortion
or
robbery,
as
they
did
with
"attempt",
then
"so
to
do"
could
have
been
put
into
that
clause,
as
well.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
not
at
all,
because
it
makes
clear
that
congress
didn't
mean,
here,
to
criminalize
every
act
of
violence
that
occurs.
it
has
to
be,
in
order
to
be
actionable,
a
"plan
of
physical
violence
to
obstruct
interstate
commerce.
"
that's
why
this
doesn't
apply--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
what
is
a
violation
of
1951--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--i
disagree,
because
i
think
then
it
does
reduce
the
words
"physical
violence
or
threats
of
physical
violence.
"
to
mere
surplusage.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
the
reason
is,
if
somebody
is
injured
in
the
course
of
a
robbery,
that's
already
punished
as
part
of
the
robbery.
in
fact,
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
make
clear
that
harms
that
are
caused
while
committing
a
crime
are
punished
as
a
part
of
that
crime.
you--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--don't
need
to--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--include
that
language.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but,
your
honor--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
your
honor,
for
every
criminal
law,
injuries
that
are
committed
by
those
who
are
engaged
in
the
criminal
activity
are
punished
as
a
part
of
that
criminal
act.
now,
justice
breyer,
your
second--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
need
to
charge
a
separate
offense.
if
you
look
at
1951(b)--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
section
1951(b),
where
it
defines
"robbery"
and
"extortion",
it
already
includes
"violence"
in
the
definition
of
"robbery"
and
"extortion".
there
would
be
no
need
for
congress
to
separately--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so,
since
the
statute
defines
1951(b),
specifically
to
include
acts
of
violence,
then
all
the
things
we're
talking
about
after
the
crime
would
already
be
part
of
what's
prohibited
by
the
statute.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
it
could
already
be
charged--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--let
me
start
labor
law
and
then
go
more
generally.
section
1951(c)
has
a
specific
provision
that
makes
clear
that
the
hobbs
act
was
not
meant
to
change
the
protection
of
labor
unions.
and,
in
fact,
every
one
of
the
statutory
references
in
1951(c)
is
to
a
statute
protecting
labor
unions.
enmons
specifically
says--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--it
lists...
it
says
"nothing
in
this
statute
is
meant
to
alter
the
protections
of.
"
and
then
it
lists
a
whole
number
of
statutes,
and
those
are
all
statutes
that
protect
labor
unions.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
this
is
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
section
3--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--of
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
right.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is,
enmons
says
there's
a
special
legislative
history
of
the
hobbs
act
specifically
about
labor.
and
enmons
concluded
that
if
the
violence
is
part
of
a
strike
to
pursue
lawful
union
activities,
it
is
not
actionable
under
the
hobbs
act.
nothing
that
this
court
would
decide
here
would
change
that
specific
protection
of
unions,
one
that's
codified
in
the
statute.
as
to
your
former
question,
nor
would
ruling
in
favor
of
respondents
here
change
the
criminal
laws
you
suggest.
the
statute
would
only
apply
to
a
plan
to
obstruct
interstate
commerce
by
physical
violence
or
threats
of
violence.
your
honor,
this
is
an
interpretation--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--right.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
because
of
the
importance
of
the
word
"plan".
and
this
goes
to
my
answer
to
justice
scalia
earlier.
the
fact
that
it
has
to
be
a
plan
to
obstruct
or
affect
interstate
commerce
is
an
important
limitation
here.
and
it's
key
to
remember
that
this
is
the
position
that
the
united
states
government
took
for
at
least
25
years...
from
the
franks
case,
in
1974,
to
the
milton
case,
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
1998,
the
yankowski
case,
in
1999...
and
it
hasn't
had
those
effects.
but
if
it
does,
your
honor,
then
the
appropriate
solution
is
for
congress
to
change
the
statute,
but
not
for
this
court
to
ignore
the
plain
meaning
of
the
law.
the
final
issue
that
was
presented
concerns
the
rico
statute.
here,
section
1964(a)
clearly
authorizes
courts
to
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
injunctions.
unlike
the
sherman
act
provision
that
only
authorized
government
to
seek
injunctive
relief,
section
1964(a)
allows
federal
courts
of
jurisdiction,
in
any
instance.
this
court
has
said,
in
many
instances,
as
chief
justice
roberts
pointed
out,
such
as
franklin
versus
gwinnett
county,
that
when
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction,
they
retain
equitable
power
unless
congress
expressly
stripped
that
authority.
so--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor,
because
this
court
has
said,
in
any
instance,
federal
courts
have
equitable
power
unless
congress
has
expressly
stripped
it
of
that
power.
united
states
versus
umansky
would
be
an
example
where
this
court
said
that,
as
well
as
the
language
from
franklin
versus
gwinnett
county.
and
that's
especially
true
here,
where
congress,
in
the
rico
statute,
specifically
said
that
it
should
be
broadly
construed.
this
court,
in
sedima
versus
imrex,
said
especially
as
to
the
remedial
provision,
section
1964,
this
should
be
broad
construction.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
government
specifically
authorized
by
1964(b)
to
get
a
preliminary
injunction.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
generally
the
government
can't
get
injunctions
to
stop
criminal
activity.
1964(b)
was
added
for
that.
but
i'd
say
1964(a),
to
go
to
your
specific
question,
would
authorize
anyone
to
be
able
to
go
to
the
federal
court
to
use
any
of
the
federal
court's
inherent
powers.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes.
1964(b)
was
added
because
of
the
traditional
common
law
rule
that
the
government
generally
can't
get
such
injunctions.
our
position
is
simple.
we
believe
that
the
hobbs
act
was
changed
precisely
to
deal
with
the
situations
where
there
might
be
a
radical
animal
activist
group
that
might
be
blowing
up
restaurants
that
serve
meat,
or
clothing
stores,
or
where
there
might
be
situations
where
racists
were
blowing
up
businesses
owned
by
blacks
or
jews.
that's
what
the
hobbs
act
does.
and
the
rico
statute
provides,
as
congress
intended,
a
broad
remedial
scheme.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
right.
but,
your
honor,
this
case--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--obviously
was
sent
back--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--to
the
seventh
circuit.
and
the
seventh
circuit
then
had
to
interpret
what
this
court
decided.
and--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--because
this
court
had
not
considered--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--the
four
acts--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--of
violence
and
threats
of
violence.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
what
this...
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
was
look
at
this
court's
opinion
and
see
that
the
statement
of
the
issues,
on
page
397--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
your
honor,
that
would
then
assume
that
this
court
decided
an
issue
about
the
meaning
of
the
hobbs
act
that
was
never
presented
in
the
cert
petitions,
never
briefed,
never
addressed
in
the
opinion.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
right.
no
discussion
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
of
course
not,
your
honor.
what
the
seventh
circuit
had
to
decide
was,
what
about
the
four
counts
of
violence
or
threats
of
violence
that
were
found
by
the
jury?
since
they
weren't
ever
discussed,
the
court
of
appeals
did
exactly
the
right
thing,
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
to
decide
whether
an
injunction
is
still
appropriate;
and,
if
so,
what
the
hobbs
act
means.
thank
you.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
true.
but
it's
unusual
that,
in
1948,
congress
actually
passed
that
statute.
and
so,
that's
binding.
here,
the
seventh
circuit--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
that's
true.
thank
you
very
much.
