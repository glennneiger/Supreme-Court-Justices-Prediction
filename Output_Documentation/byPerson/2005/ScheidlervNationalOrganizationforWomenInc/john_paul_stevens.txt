justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
any
argument
on
the
merits
as
to
those
four
counts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
yeah.
is
it
conceivable
that
we
overlooked
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
i
just...
do
you
think
it's
conceivable
that
we
just
didn't
realize
those
four
points
were
at
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
think
we
resolved
the
statutory
construction
issue
that
you're
now
arguing
very
carefully
at
this
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
may
assume
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
there's
nothing
in
the
opinion
to
give
any--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
course,
the
reason
they
said
it
was
plausible
is
that...
and
you
may
well
be
right,
on
the
bottom
line,
and
the
government
agrees
with
you,
but
there
are...
there's
a
redundancy
in
the
statute.
there's
a
phrase
in
there
that
could
be
taken
out,
and
the
statute
would
have
exactly
the
same
meaning,
if
you're
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
those
words...
i
forget
what
the...
"commit
threats
of
physical
violence".
so,
take
those
words
out.
the
statute
will
have
the
same
meaning.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
really?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
function
do
they
perform?
what
case
would
it
cover
that
would
not
otherwise
be
covered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
do
not
rise
to
an
obtaining?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're...
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
at
the
time
they
did
that,
the
clayton
act
had
already
been
passed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--ms.
blatt--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
identify
a
concern?
i'd
like
you
to
help
me
out
on
it.
i...
that
language,
if
you
construe
it
the
way
the
other
side
does,
it
would
cover
certain
violent
conspiracies
that
would
merely
obstruct
interstate
commerce
that
we
could
all
be
concerned
about
today.
are
there
other
criminal
statutes
on
the
book
that
fill
that
gap?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you're
saying,
in
substance,
that
you
don't
need
to
read
the
hobbs
act
the
way
they
do
in
order
to
protect
the
public
from
the
kind
of
harms
that
the...
they
would
read
the
statute
as
covering.
justice
john
paul
stevens
regardless
of
whether
we
knew
what
we
were
doing,
we
said
it.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
when
it's
perfectly
clear
that
we
didn't
know
it.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
there's
even
an
arguable
basis
for
saying
we
resolved
the
statutory
question
that's
presented
now,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
not
mentioned
in
the
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
think
we
would
actually
enter
judgment.
we'd...
we
might
reverse
with
instructions
to
have
the
lower
court
enter
judgment,
but
we
wouldn't
enter
the
judgment
ourselves.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
mandate,
in
this
case,
remanded,
is
that
what
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
further
proceedings--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--consistent
with
the
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
also
actually
entered
a
mandate,
too.
[laughter]
