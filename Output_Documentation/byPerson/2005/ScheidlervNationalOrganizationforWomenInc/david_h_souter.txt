justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
true,
but
don't
you
have
the
further
difficulty
that
we
didn't
nearly
reverse
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
hobbs
act
violations,
or
to
the
listed
ones.
we
made
it
clear.
we
said,
expressly,
that
the
judgment
had
to
be
reversed,
which
seems
to
sweep
everything
within
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
i
mean,
that's
what
we
always
say.
and
it
may
be
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
do,
at
that
point,
except
enter
judgment
for
one
side
and
be
done
with
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think...
i
think,
you
know,
your
argument
is
fine,
but
the
trouble
is,
if
the
question
is,
"did
the
seventh
circuit
honor
the
judgment
of
this
court?
"
i
think
there's
a
pretty
good
argument
that
it
not...
that
it
did
not,
based
upon
the
fact
that
we,
in
effect,
summed
up
everything
we
were
purporting
to
say
with
the
phrase
that
the
judgment
itself
had
to
be
reversed.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
what
do
you
say
to
the
response--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
you
say
they
are
punished
as
a
part
of
the
act,
but
justice
scalia's
point
is
still
true,
it
only
goes
to
punishment.
the
way
this
is
written,
it
may
be
charged
as
a
separate
offense.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i
mean,
one
is...
i'm
attempted
to
say,
"well,
tell
congress
that".
if
they
want
to
create
a
separate
offense,
they
can
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
reasonable
reading
of
that,
"violence
in
the
course
of
achieving...
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
the
object
in
question.
"
as
opposed
to,
in
effect,
a
"by
blow
against
a
bystander"?
