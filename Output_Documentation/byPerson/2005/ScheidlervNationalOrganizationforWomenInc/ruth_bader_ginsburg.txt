yes,
but
there
was
a
theory
that
was
put
to
the
jury...
and
it's
right
there
on
the
special
interrogatories...
one
category
was
violent
acts
that
obstruct
commerce
with
no
connection
at
all
to
extortion.
that
was
there.
and
i
have
a
question
about
your
characterization
of
what
the
seventh
circuit
did.
it
was
puzzled.
it
says,
"extortion,
they
all
go".
but
here
are
these
four
that
don't
involve
extortion,
and
there's
no
ruling
from
the
court
on
those.
was
the
court
supposed
to
assume
that
the
court
made
a
question...
decided
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
by
silence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
whether
the
court
should
rule
on
it,
as
in
a
matter
of
first
decision.
we
are
a
court
of
review.
there
was
no
determination
of
whether
the
hobbs
act
included
such
a
category
in
the
seventh
circuit.
so,
the
difficulty,
the
impediment
to
addressing
your
position
is
that
however
strong
it
may
be,
it
wasn't
resolved
below,
so
why
shouldn't
we
follow
the
natural
order
that
first
the
district
court
speaks,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
it
comes
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
concerned
about
your
characterization,
not
only
of
suggesting
that
there
was
some
attempt
to
force
a
particular
decision,
but
i'm
reading
the
seventh
circuit's
remand
to
the
district
court.
it
went
through
your
argument,
which
it
said
was
a
substantial
one,
that
no
change
was
intended
in
the
codification.
and
it
said,
"while
these
revisions
were
intended
to
be
formal
stylistic
changes,
it
is
not
beyond
the
realm
of
the
possible
that
the
revisors
may
have
made
certain
substantive
changes.
"
that
doesn't
sound
like
they
were
ruling
on
it
definitively,
but
they
were
tipping
their
hand.
"not
beyond
the
realm
of
the
possible.
"
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
asked
the
district
court
to
resolve
it.
they
said
the
district
court
should
resolve
it
in
the
first
instance,
and
then
they
would
review
it,
presumably.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
two
u.s.
attorneys,
years
back,
did
predicate
cases
on
there
being
a
discrete
crime
of
obstructing
commerce
through
violent
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt,
your
time
is
almost
over,
so,
on
the
injunction
part,
what
remedies
are
available
to
the
united
states
under
your
reading
of
the
provision?
injunctive
relief,
yes.
what
about...
is
there
any
monetary
relief
that
the
united
states
can
seek
under
rico?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chemerinsky,
if
we
turn
from
what
this
court
did,
or
did
not,
think
about
last
time
around
to
what
those
four
counts
were,
would
i
look
to
find
out
what
were
those
four
acts
of
violence
that
remain
in
the
case?
i
could
not
find,
in
any
of
the
papers
before
us,
any
specific
definition
of
what
those
acts
of
violence
were.
i
mean,
the
jury
was
given...
i
don't
know
what...
was
it
a
dozen
possibilities?
and
they
found
four.
but
which
four,
we
have
no
idea.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he...
but
wasn't
this
tried
to
a
jury?
that
was
a
jury
that
made
those
findings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
jury
is
no
longer
sitting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
knows
that
there
were
four
acts.
he
knows
that
he...
under
his
instructions,
the
jury
could
pick
12.
how
could
he
know
which
four
the
jury
homed
in
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
does
it...
when
what
turns
on
that
finding
is
injunctive
relief,
the
judge
might
very
well
be
influenced
by
what
those
particular
acts
were.
he
might
say
one
set
of
four
was
not
adequate
to
issue
this
injunction,
but
another
set
of
four
would
be.
and
we
just
don't
know...
we
don't
know
what
those
acts
were.
the
jury
is
not
to
be
called
back.
the
seventh
circuit
said
"no
more
evidence".
so,
if
we
get
down
to
those
four
acts,
how
can
we
say
those
are
sufficient
to
uphold
an
injunction,
when
we
don't
even
know
what
the
acts
were?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
seventh
circuit
in
its
most
recent
expression
said,
"it
may
well
be
that
the
judge
will
decide
that
those
four
predicate
acts.
"
--as
opposed
to
121
going
in,
four...
"were
not
sufficient
to
support
certainly
a
nationwide
injunction,
but
perhaps
not
any
injunction.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chemerinsky,
the
problem
that
i
have,
and
justice
breyer
expressed,
is,
we
have
the
revisor's
notes
that
suggest,
"i
was
just
getting
rid
of
extra
words.
"
"i
was
making
this
a
tighter
provision.
"
and
there's
not
anything
to
indicate
that
congress
considered
any
change
in
the
substance
of
the
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here's
a...
the
revisor
telling
us,
"i
did
this,
and
i
did
this
to
clean
up
the
act,
to
make
it
less
wordy.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
you
read
it,
can
a
private
party
get
a
preliminary
injunction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
a
private
party
could
get
an...
not
only
permanent,
but
preliminary--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--injunction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
made
the
assumption
that
this
court
has
an
obligation
to
reason
why,
and
there
was
no
reason
why
given
as
to
those
four
counts.
