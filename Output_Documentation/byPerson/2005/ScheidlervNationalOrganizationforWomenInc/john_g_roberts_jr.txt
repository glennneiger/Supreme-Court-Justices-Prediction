roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
scheidler
versus
national
organization
for
women,
and
operation
rescue
versus
national
organization
for
women.
mr.
untereiner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
we
didn't
reach
that,
last
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why,
if
we...
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
hobbs
act,
i
assume
you
would
not
have
us
reach
that
third
question
this
time,
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument's
a
little
inconsistent
with
the
franklin
case,
though.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
gwinnett...
franklin
versus
gwinnett
county.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
blatt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
chemerinsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
look...
do
we...
do
we
typically
enter
judgment,
ourselves?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
was
the
last
time
we
did
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
also
said,
in
the
last
paragraph,
"all
of
the
predicate
acts
supporting
the
jury's
verdict.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
says--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
"#
all
the
predicate
acts
supporting
the
jury's
finding
of
a
rico
violation.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
it's
quite
clear
what
"all"
was
referring
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
anything
that...
under
your
reading
of
the
hobbs
act,
that
isn't
covered
by
the
face
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know.
but
in
terms
of
the...
we
now
have
specific
legislation
addressed
to
the
specific
context.
and
all
of
the
acts
that
you're
complaining
of
in
the
original
suit
are
actionable
under
the
face
act,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we've
also
said
that
we
don't
assume
a
substantive
change
from
a
recodification.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
your
argument
requires
us
to
assume
that
congress
intended
a
substantive
change
when
it
recodified
the
hobbs
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who...
who's
enacted
the
model
penal
code?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
friend's
answer
was
that
that
was
an
implied
right
of
action
case;
and,
therefore,
the
remedies
had
not
been
spelled
out;
and
so,
you
assume
the
broader
remedies.
what's
wrong
with
that
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
congress
never
discussed
the
change
in
the
hobbs
act
that
you're
proposing,
in
1948.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chemerinsky.
mr.
untereiner,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
in
no.
