well,
i'm
with
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--up
to
the
point
where
you
say
it
went
as
far
as
it
possibly
could.
as
justice
scalia
indicates,
why
didn't
it
say,
"this
is
the
way
the
act
must
be
interpreted.
"
period?
so,
it
didn't
go
as
far
as...
i'm
just
quibbling
with
your...
i'm
just
quibbling
with
your
statement
that
it
went
as
far
as
it
possibly
could.
i
don't
think
it
did.
that's
the
problem.
justice

we
got
you
off
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
got
you
off
of
your
first
point,
but
i'd
like
to
just
loop
back
to
that
for
a
minute,
at
this
point.
is
this
imprecision,
this
ambiguity,
grounds
for
our
reading...
our
insisting
on
reading
our
earlier
remand
and
judgment
literally
and
saying
that
there
are
no
predicate
acts...
there
are
no
predicate
acts
that
support
this
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do...
is
there
some
prudential
argument
for
us
not
to
reach
this
issue
and
just
insist
on
the
wording
of
our
earlier
mandate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
mean?
it's
a
separate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
separate
offense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
charge
two
counts
for
violating
the
same
section?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
two
separate
violations,
each
of
which
violates
the
same
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have...
just
have
one
question.
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
petitioner's
first
suggestion
that
we
should
simply
have
a
strict
reading
of
our
mandate,
would
that
cause
problems,
so
far
as
people
interpreting
our
precedent
and
indicating
that,
by
implication,
we've
reached
this
hobbs
act
question?
