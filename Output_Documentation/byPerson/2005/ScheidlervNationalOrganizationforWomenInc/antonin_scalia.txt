justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
how
could
the...
how
could
the
court
of
appeals
not
have
resolved
this
issue?
how
could
it
possibly
have
rendered
its
judgment
without
resolving
this
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
raise
this
issue
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
is
that
how
we
apply
statutes,
that
if
they
may
plausibly
be
read
a
certain
way,
that's
what
they
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
how
that's
a
resolution
of
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
how
they...
how
they
could
dispose
of
the
case
without
resolving
that.
that's
my
puzzlement.
justice
antonin
scalia
how...
i
mean,
can
we
do
that
in
a
case
that
comes
up
here,
and
just
say,
"there
are
good
arguments
on
both
sides,
it's
quite
plausible.
"
and
remand
the
case
without
resolving
the
issue?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
except
if
they
think
we
didn't
know
what
we
were
doing.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
ignore
it
if
they...
if
they
think
that
we
didn't
know
what
we
were
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
talking
about
the
deciding
of
issues;
he's
talking
about
reversing
a
judgment.
you
don't
have
to
go
into
what
the
issues
are
in
order
to
follow
that
instruction.
the
judgment
is
reversed.
and
if
there
were
issues
that
should
have
been
resolved
in
order
to
reverse
the
judgment,
and
that
weren't,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
your
remedy
would
not
be
to
say
to
the
court
of
appeals,
"well,
the
supreme
court
didn't
mean
what
it
said.
"
or,
"didn't
know
what
it
was
doing.
"
but,
rather,
to
move
for
reconsideration
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
you
couldn't...
you
couldn't
file
a
motion
for
rehearing
on
the
ground
that
the
court
neglected
to
address
four
points
that
were
made
very...
you
made
nothing
of
them
in
the...
in
the
argument
or
in
the
briefs.
it
was
almost
not
considered
at
all.
do
you
mean
that
when
a
judgment
is
issued
that
is
so
clearly,
in
your
view,
erroneous,
you
can't
come
to
the
court
and
say,
"the
judgment
is
erroneous,
you
forgot
to
address
these
issues?
"
i
hope
you
can
do
that
in
a
motion
for
rehearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
would
have
to
say
not
just
that.
they
would
have
to
say,
"the
court
did
not
deal
with
those
four
issues,
and,
therefore,
its
judgment
was
erroneous.
"
they
would
have
to
say
that
in
order
to...
in
order
to
act
the
way
they
did--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
our
judgment
was
"reverse".
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
"most
favorable
to
its
conclusion",
but
did
the
jury
conclude
that
there
should
be
an
injunction?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
up
to
the
judge.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
i
mean,
the
principle
that
you
interpret
a
verdict
in
the
manner
most
favorable
to
its
conclusion
has
no
application
here
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
mean
it's
up...
i
don't
understand
that.
the
judge,
in
order
to
issue
the
injunction,
becomes
a
second
factfinder,
and
he
can
find
four...
he
can
pick
four
out
of
the
twelve,
perhaps
four
that
the
jury
had
not
picked?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
he
can...
he
can
actually
make
a
finding.
and
it...
and
it
could
be
that
the
jury
found
that
eight
of
them
weren't
valid,
and
the
judge,
in
order
to
issue
an
injunction,
can
contradict
the
jury
and
say,
"you
know,
i
find
that
other
four?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let
me
talk--
justice
antonin
scalia
--about
the
comma.
i
don't...
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
your
argument
on
that
point.
i
mean,
it
says,
"whoever,
in
any
way
or
degree,
obstructs,
delays,
or
affects
commerce
or
the
movement
or
any
article
or
commodity
in
commerce
by
robbery
or
extortion
or
attempts
or
conspires
to
do
so.
"
comma...
that's
the
comma
you're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
"#
or
threatens
physical
violence
to
any
person
or
property.
"
but
it
continues,
"in
furtherance
of
a
plan
or
purpose
to
do
anything
in
violation
of
this
section.
"
now,
the
only
thing
that
this
section
has,
prior
to
that
statement,
said
to
be
a
violation
is
obstructing/delaying
by
robbery,
extortion,
or
attempt
or
conspiracy
to
robbery
or
extortion.
justice
antonin
scalia
"plan
to
do
anything
in
violation
of
this
section.
"
which
is
not
just
obstructing
commerce,
but
obstructing
it
by
robbery,
extortion,
or
attempt
or
conspiracy
to
robbery
or
extortion.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is...
what
meaning
do
you
give
to
the
phrase
"in
furtherance
of
a
plan
or
purpose
to
do
anything
in
violation
of
this
section?
"
under
your
interpretation,
you
could
just
drop
that...
drop
that
phrase
completely.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
a
violation
of
the
section.
1951.
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
obstructing
it
by
robbery
or
by
extortion
or
by
attempt
or
conspiracy
to
robbery
or
extortion.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--convicted--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
the
crime,
but
you
cannot
be
indicted
as
a
separate
crime.
this
makes
it
a
separate
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
we...
you
can
use
it
to
aggravate
the
punishment
for
some
other
offense,
but
this
does...
this
does
something
quite
beyond
that.
it
says
it
is
a
separate
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
chemerinsky,
i...
you
said
earlier
that
our...
that
we
"reversed
and
remanded".
that
was
not
in
our
opinion,
though,
as
it
sometimes
is,
"therefore,
you
know,
the
case
is
remanded.
"
it
doesn't
say
that.
our
opinion
here
just
says
"reversed".
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--"#
reversed".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
and
they
interpreted
"reversed"
to
mean
"remanded".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
that
enabled
them
to
say
that
what
we
meant
was
not
"reversed",
but
"reversed
and
remanded".
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
look
at
the
last
line
of
our
opinion,
which
said
"reversed".
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
broad
principle.
whenever
a
court
of
appeals
thinks
that
we
haven't
really
resolved
all
the
issues
in
the
case,
they
can
ignore
our
order
that
says
"reversed".
