ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
physical
violence
clause
of
the
hobbs
act
requires
an
intended
robbery
or
extortion,
and
that
private
parties,
under
rico,
cannot
obtain
injunctive
relief.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
right.
we
think
what
would
be
appropriate
is
to
recognize
that
the...
this
court's
decision
last
time
around
did
contain
a
sweeping
statement
at
the
end
that
all
the
predicate
acts
must
be
reversed.
at
the
same
time,
the
issue
of
the
physical
violence
clause
was
not
briefed
by
the
parties,
it
was
not
discussed
in
this
court's
opinion,
it
was
not
discussed
in
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion.
and
"law
of
the
case"
type
principles
are
discretionary,
and
this
court
has
the
discretion
to
reach
the
two
other
issues
in
the
case.
now,
the
rico
issue
is
more
squarely
presented,
because
there's
an
actual
holding
by
the
seventh
circuit
on
that
point.
it's
also
an
issue
on
which
the
circuits
are
divided.
it's
important
and
recurring,
and
it's
been
before
this
court
twice.
at
the
same
time,
the
court
also
has
discretion
to
clean
up,
or
clarify,
the
hobbs
act
issue.
there
was
a
remand.
and
although
there's
no
holding
by
the
seventh
circuit,
there
was
a
remand
that
was
predicated
and
based
on
an
assumption
that
the
plaintiffs
had
raised
at
least
a
substantial
question.
and
this
court
has
discretion
to
say
that
was
an
error
of
law,
because,
under
the
plain
language,
the
physical
violence
clause
is
linked
to
robbery
or
extortion.
that's
plain
on
the
statute,
because
it
requires
that
the
physical
violence
be
in
furtherance
of
a
violation.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
and
those
prosecutions
were
inconsistent
with
the
written
guidance
of
the
department
of
justice
in
a
longstanding
interpretation
of
the
hobbs
act,
at
least
since
1965,
that
it
required
an
intended
robbery
or
extortion.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
18
u.s.c.
2332(b),
subsection
(g),
is
a
laundry
list
of
federal
statutes,
and
it's
a
good
source
of
reference
for
the
type
of
federal
statutes
that
cover
violence
where
there's
a
distinct
federal
interest.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
there's
a
lot
of
statutes
on
the
books
that
apply
to
bombing
in
public
places,
violence
against
communication
facilities,
computer,
transportation,
energy,
airports,
any
kind
of
mass
transportation.
and
that...
18
usc
2332...
it's
a
long
list
of
statutes.
there's
also
the
arson
statute
and
the
bombing
statute,
the
use
of
any
explosives
in
a...
in
a...
in
a
facility
that's
used
in
interstate
commerce.
and
the
government
has
brought
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
hobbs
act
prosecutions,
and,
but
for
those
two,
the
only
two
that
we
can
identify,
all
of
our
prosecutions
have
been
linked
to
robbery
or
extortion.
and
if
i
could
address
the
superfluous
point,
we
don't
think
the
clause
is
superfluous
either,
for
two
reasons.
it
applies
to
a
defendant
who
injures
innocent
bystanders
during
a
robbery.
now,
the
defendant
has
committed
the
crime
of
robbery,
but
he's
also
committed
the
separate
crime
of
using
violence
against
any
person
in
furtherance
of
that
robbery.
so,
there
could
be
cumulative
punishment
based
on
that
offense,
and
there
would
be--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--two
separate
offenses.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's
a
separate
offense
for--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes,
because
there's
two
distinct
harms.
there's
not
only
the
business,
as
the
victim
of
the
robbery,
but
there's
the
innocent
bystanders
who
were
injured
or
killed
during
the
course
of
that
robbery,
and
that
would
be
two
separate...
and
then
there's
another
way
it's
not--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes,
that's
right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--face
act.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
absolutely
correct.
the
face
act,
which
was
passed
in
1994,
gives
private
parties
a
right
for
damages
and
injunctive
relief
for
blocking
access
to
clinics.
that
would...
that
would
cover
this
specific
case,
and
then
there's
the
more
general
statutes
i
was
speaking
about
earlier.
but
there
is
a
specific
right
to
injunctive
relief,
and
i
think
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
tried
to
add
claims
under
the
face
act,
but
they
were...
they
were
denied
the
ability
to
do
that.
the
second
way
it's
not
superfluous
is
the
example
given
by
petitioners,
in
that
it
applies
to
a
defendant,
for
instance,
who
tries
to
enlist
another
person
in
a
robbery,
but
the
neighbor,
or
the...
excuse
me,
that
person
just
refuses.
the
physical
violence
clause
would
apply
to
that
situation
regardless
of
whether
that
conduct
also
qualifies
as
an
attempt.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
1964(a)
addresses
equitable
relief,
and
the
government
can
get
things
like
disgorgement
under
(a).
but
as
far
as
damages
are
concerned--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no.
this
court
held,
in
the
cooper
case,
which
is
an
antitrust
case
that
was
talked
about
in
the
flamingo
decision
recently,
the
united
states
is
not
a
person
who
is
able
to
sue
under
the
antitrust
laws,
because...
the
general
background
principle
that
the
united
states
is
not
a
person.
and
we
think
it's
highly
relevant
that,
after
this
court
repeatedly
held
that
private
parties
cannot
get
injunctive
relief,
that
the
united
states
cannot
get
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws,
congress,
in
the
clayton
act,
passed
two
express
provisions
of
government
damages
action...
that
was
in
1955,
and
now
it's
a
treble
damages
action...
as
well
as
an
express
private
injunctive
action.
and,
thus,
there
was
this
menu
of
remedies
in
the
antitrust
laws
of
express
government
equitable,
express
government
damages,
express
private
treble
damages,
and
then
government
damages.
but
congress,
in
rico,
only
picked
up
two
of
them.
it
picked
up
an
express,
a
right
for
the
attorney
general
to
seek
injunctive
relief
and
other
equitable
relief,
and
it
picked
up
an
express
right
for
private
parties
only
to
seek
treble
damages.
in
light
of
the
holding
after
holding
after
holding,
we
identified
six
cases
that
were...
that
were
rendered
before
the
passage
of
rico,
and
the
cooper
decision,
which
said
the
government
cannot
seek
damages.
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
when
congress
borrowed
from
the
antitrust
laws,
but
did
not
pick
up
those
two
express
rights,
that
the
governing
principle
is
that
when
congress
borrows
a
statute
that's
been
definitively
construed,
congress
adopts
that
judicial
construction
along
with
the
statute.
and
it's
particularly
relevant
because
of
those
two
express
provisions.
and
rico
is...
just
contains
that
structure
that
was
there
in
the
sherman
act,
with
the
express
public
equitable
action
and
the
express
private
treble
damages
action.
if
there
are
no
question,
we'd
ask
the
court
to,
if
it
wants,
to
reach--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
in
the...
i
don't
think
so.
the
court
could
apply
just
straightforward
"law
of
the
case"
principles
and
say,
"regardless
of
whether
we
actually
reached
the
four
predicate
acts,
our
judgment
spoke
clearly
that
the
injunction
had
to
be
vacated.
"
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
and
that's
why
we
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
say,
just
like
the
court
did
in
the
recent
per
curiam
eberhart,
that
generally
courts
are
supposed
to
follow
this
court's
mandates,
and
they're
supposed
to
articulate
their
concerns
to
facilitate
resolution
by
this
court,
and
then
leave
it
up
to
this
court
to
clarify
an
earlier
decision.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
they
could
have--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--we
do
think
that
the
judgment
did
sweep
more
broadly
than
the
circumstances--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
because
usually
the
court
doesn't
decide
important...
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute,
a
federal
criminal
statute,
without
discussing
it.
it
was...
i
don't
want
to
say
"buried
in
footnotes",
but
it
was
mentioned
in
the
footnotes
at
the
petition
stage
the
second
time
around,
and
then
it
dropped
out
of
the
case.
and
even
the
united
states
didn't
discuss
it--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it's
not
mentioned
in
the
opinion.
it's
not
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
at
the
merits
stage.
it
was
not
mentioned
by
the
seventh
circuit.
at
the
same
time,
the
court,
at
the
end,
did
say
that
all
of
the
predicate
acts
had
to
be
reversed.
thank
you.
