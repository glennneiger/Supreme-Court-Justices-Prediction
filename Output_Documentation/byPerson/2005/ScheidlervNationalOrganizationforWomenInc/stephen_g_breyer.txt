justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it...
you
just...
on
your
list,
i
had
the
impression,
but
tell
me
if
i'm
right
or
wrong,
that
there's
a
specific
statute
dealing
with
abortion
clinics
now,
though
there
wasn't
when
this
case
began.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--operation
rescue
did
the
same
kind
of
thing
now
that
they
did
then,
the
petitioners
in...
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
would
be
able
to
get
relief
under
that
statute.
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
you
to
get
to
the
meaning
of
the
hobbs
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'll
try
to
focus
my
own
thoughts
on
this
by
saying
two
objections
to
what
you're
arguing,
related,
that
when
they
passed
the
hobbs
act,
it
had
a
section
2,
and
section
2
said,
"this
is
an
act
that
forbids
robbery
and
extortion,
all
involving
interstate
commerce.
"
"and
robbery/extortion
involve
property.
"
then
it
had
a
section
5.
and
section
5
said,
"this
act
forbids
physical
violence
or
threats
of
violence
related
to
section
2.
"
now,
all
that
happened
since
then
is,
there
was
a
recodification.
and
the
recodification
wasn't
meant
to
change
anything
substantive.
second
and
related
point
enmons.
for
35
years,
working
people
in
this
country
have
thought
they
had
a
right
to
strike,
free
of
the
hobbs
act.
and
your
interpretation,
as
the
afl
cio
points
out,
will
gut
the
right
to
strike.
now,
those
are
two
strong
arguments
against
you,
and
i'd
like
to
hear
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
a
jurisdictional
hook,
isn't
it?
when
you
see
something
in
a
criminal
statute
that
forbids
"affecting
commerce
by",
that
means
that
congress
wants
to
prevent
the
conduct
that
will
follow
the
words
"by",
and
it
needs
a
jurisdictional
hook,
so
it
puts
in
"affecting
commerce".
that's
how
i've
always
understood
the
federal
criminal
code.
am
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--wrong
in
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
want
to
give
you
a
chance,
because
you're
quite
right
in
thinking
that
i'm
moved,
in
large
part...
or
worried,
in
large
part...
not
about
this
language,
but
about
the
change
in
federal
criminal
law.
and
the
change
in
federal
criminal
law,
if
you're
right,
way
beyond
this
case,
would
transform
virtually
every
threat
of
violence
made
anywhere
in
the
united
states
into
a
serious
federal
crime.
at
the
least,
it
would...
and
make
a
major
change
in
threats
of
violence
on
the
picket
line.
and
those
are
two
aspects
of
the
same
thing.
and
i'm
worried
about
the
upsetting
of
expectations
way
outside
the
context
of
this
case
and
making
a
major
change
in
federal
labor
law,
for
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it...
1951(c)
says
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
i...
then
perhaps
i...
that's
an
old
statute,
1951(c),
isn't
it?
is
it
something
brand
new?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
what
is
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
the
case
that
interpreted
the
hobbs
act,
which
is
enmons--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--seems
to
rely,
for
the
labor
union
exemption,
on
the
fact
that
a
threat
of
violence
in
effort
to
obtain
legitimate
wages
is
not
within
the
act.
but
if
we
read
"legitimate
wages"
out
of
the
act,
then
i
guess
we
would
be
left
with
"the
threat
of
violence".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
the...
it's
not
a...
that's
wrong.
it
says
"affect
commerce".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
therefore,
we
have
the
instance
of
any
threat
of
violence
that
affects
commerce
becomes
a
federal
crime
subject
to
20
years
of
imprisonment.
and,
of
course,
in
today's
world,
as
you
know,
i
believe
almost
everything
affects
commerce.
and
if
i'm
even
close
to
being
right,
this
is
a
major
incursion
of
federal
law,
serious
criminal
federal
law,
into
what
could
be
fairly
minor
matters
of
state
criminal
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
respondents
in
this
litigation,
which
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time,
the
respondents
are
a
pro-choice
organization.
they
have
sued
the
petitioners.
the
petitioners
engage
in
pro-life
demonstrations
at
clinics
that
provide
abortions.
now,
the
respondents
are
seeking
an
injunction
issued
by
the
court,
which
would
prohibit
acts
of
violence
at
the
clinics.
they
are
basing
their
legal
claim
not
on
a
specific
statute
which
exists
about
abortion
clinics,
but
rather
on
a
general
criminal
statute,
the
hobbs
act,
an
act
that
prohibits
robbery
and
extortion
that
affects
interstate
commerce.
we
previously
decided
that
respondents
failed
to
show
that
the
petitioners
were
involved
in
robbery
or
extortion,
so
the
act
doesn’t
apply;
but
the
petitioners
have
shown
acts
of
violence
not
related
to
extortion
or
robbery;
and
that
has
come
back
to
us
and
they
want
to
base
their
injunction
on
those
acts,
and
so
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
hobbs
act
forbids
violence,
plain
and
simple.
well,
the
hobbs
act
says
that
an
individual
commits
a
federal
crime
if
he
or
she,
“obstructs,
delays
or
affects
commerce”,
by,
“robbery”
or,
“extortion”
or
--
and
these
are
the
key
words
--
“committing
or
threatening
physical
violence
to
any
person
or
property
in
furtherance
of
a
plan
or
purpose
to
do
anything
in
violation
of
this
section".
the
question
in
the
case
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
words
"in
furtherance
of
a
plan
or
purpose
to
do
anything
in
violation
of
this
section".
does
that
phrase
refer
to
violence
committed
pursuant
to
the
plans
or
purposes
that
affect
interstate
commerce
through
robbery
or
extortion,
or
does
it
refer
to
violence
committed
pursuant
to
the
plans
or
purposes
that
affect
interstate
commerce,
plain
and
simple?
if
the
former,
the
statute
governs
only
a
limited
subset
of
violent
behavior;
namely,
violent
behavior
connected
to
robbery
and
extortion.
if
it’s
the
latter,
the
statute
governs
a
much
broader
range
of
human
activity;
namely,
all
violent
actions
against
persons
or
property
that
affect
interstate
commerce.
well,
we
think
that
the
former,
the
more
restrictive
reading
of
the
act.
it’s
an
important
federal
criminal
statute.
we
think
that
former
limited
interpretation
is
the
correct
interpretation.
first,
the
language
of
the
statute
makes
the
more
restrictive
reading
the
more
natural
reading.
the
text
that
precedes
the
physical
violence
clause
does
not
forbid
obstructing
or
delaying
or
affecting
commerce;
what
it
forbids
is
obstructing,
delaying
or
affecting
commerce
by
robbery
or
extortion.
the
phrase
in
question
speaks
of
an
earlier
violation,
and
robbery
and
extortion
are
the
only
earlier
violations
that
are
mentioned.
second,
the
history
makes
very
clear
that
this
more
restrictive
reading
is
correct.
in
an
earlier
1946
version
of
the
act,
congress
put
its
prohibitions
against
robbery
and
extortion
in
section
2.
it
then
put
the
prohibition
against
violence
in
section
5,
and
what
it
said
in
section
5
was
the
kind
of
violence
that
were
it
prohibiting
is
the
kind
of
violence
that
is
connected
with
a
purpose
to
violate
section
2,
which
was
where
robbery
and
extortion
was
referred
to.
the
present
language
of
the
hobbs
act
is
not
that
clear,
but
the
changes
from
the
earlier
act
reflect
nothing
more
than
a
re-codification
of
the
statute,
not
an
effort
to
change
the
crime.
third,
the
broad
interpretation
that
respondents
advocate
would
federalize
an
enormous
amount
of
ordinary
criminal
behavior
ranging
from
simple
assault
to
murder,
behavior
that
is
typically
the
subject
of
state,
not
federal,
prosecutions.
not
surprisingly,
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts
of
appeals
have
assumed
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
hobbs
act
to
have
so
broad
a
reach.
that
perhaps
is
why
congress
thought
it
necessary
to
enact,
and
in
1994
did
enact,
a
specific
statute
aimed
indirectly
at
clinic
violence,
a
statute,
as
i
have
said,
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
we
conclude
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
a
freestanding
physical-violence
offense
in
the
hobbs
act.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
entry
of
judgment
for
petitioners.
our
decision
is
unanimous;
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
