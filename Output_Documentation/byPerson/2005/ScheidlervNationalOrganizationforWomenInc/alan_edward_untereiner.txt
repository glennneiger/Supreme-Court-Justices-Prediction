mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
2003,
this
court,
through
all
appearances,
brought
this
case
to
an
end
by
holding
that
all
of
predicate
rico
counts
found
by
the
jury
must
be
reversed,
that
the
liability
judgment
must
be
reversed,
and
that
the
injunction
must
be
vacated.
on
remand,
however,
a
panel
of
the
seventh
circuit
found
a
way
to
keep
this
case
alive.
it
held
that
four
of
the
121
rico
predicates
somehow
survived
this
court's
decision,
and
it
strongly
suggested
that
the
hobbs
act
punishes
acts
or
threats
of
physical
violence
that
have
no
connection
to
either
robbery
or
extortion.
today,
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
erroneous
decision
below
and
remand
with
very
explicit
instructions
that
judgment
be
entered
in
favor
of
petitioners.
reversal
is
warranted
because
of
three
separate
legal
errors
made
by
the
seventh
circuit.
first,
the
lower
court
failed
to
obey
the
clear
holdings
and
remand
instructions
of
this
court.
second,
the
seventh
circuit
erroneously
held,
in
conflict
with
two
other
circuits,
that
the
hobbs
act
plausibly
can
be
read
to
cover
freestanding
acts
or
threats
of
physical
violence.
and,
third,
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
its
previous
decision,
in
2001,
in
holding
that
the
racketeering
law,
rico,
authorizes
private
injunctive
relief.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
because
of
what
the
seventh
circuit
also
said,
that
a
new
trial
is
not
in
the
cards
and
the
damages
verdict
is
gone
and
nothing
more
remains
to
be
done
except
for
the
two
issues
that
it
outlined,
that's
correct.
if
the
court
rules
in
our
favor
on
any
issue,
the
case
is
over.
let
me
turn
to
our
first
point.
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
previous
holdings.
this
court's
2003
opinion
left
no
doubt
that,
quote,
rico
predicates
must
be
reversed.
but--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--no.
no,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
argument
was
made
in
this
court,
at
the
petition
stage
the
last
time
around,
that
those
four
counts
were,
in
fact,
included
in
the
petitions.
at
that
time,
of
course,
there
was
no
contrary
authority.
the
yankowski
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
made
clear,
and
i
think
the
language
of
the
hobbs
act
makes
clear,
that
freestanding
acts
or
threats
of
violence
are
not
covered.
so,
we
argued,
at
the
petition
stage,
that
those
counts
were
covered.
and
then,
at
the
merits
stage,
the
petitioners
asked
this
court
to
reverse
and
remand
for
entry
of
judgment
in
our
favor
on
all
claims
and
all
counts.
the
respondents,
at
that
point,
did
not
argue--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well,
we
take
the
court
to
mean
what
it...
what
it
says.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
i
think
it's
possible.
but
if
the
court
did
overlook
those,
i
think
that
would
have
been
something
that
should
have
been
raised
in
a
rehearing
petition
in
this
court.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
there's
no
indication,
in
the
court's
opinion,
that
it
resolved
it.
it
may
have
assumed
that
we
were
right,
because
we
made
the
argument
at
the--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--petition
stage--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--that's
correct.
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
i'd
be
happy
to--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--i'd
be
happy
to
move
on,
justice
o'connor,
to
those
two
issues.
our
second
argument
is
that
the
hobbs
act
does
not
punish
freestanding
acts
or
threats
of
violence.
by
"freestanding",
we
mean
unconnected
to
either
robbery
or
extortion.
and
i
think
that's
apparent
from
the
language
of
the
hobbs
act,
which
has
three
clauses.
and
the
third
clause
covers
acts
or
threats
of
violence,
quote,
"in
furtherance
of
any
plan
or
purpose
to
do
anything
in
violation
of
this
section.
"
unquote.
so,
there
needs
to
be
a
connection.
there
needs
to
be
a
violation
of
this
section.
and
our
position
is
that
that
refers
back
to
the
principal
offenses
under
section
1951,
robbery
or
extortion.
now,
the
respondent's
position
is
that
the
mere
act
of
obstructing
commerce,
or
affecting
commerce,
or,
i
suppose,
even
delaying
commerce,
is
a
violation
of
the
hobbs
act.
and
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
read
the
statutory
language
that
way.
so,
we
think
that
argument
is
clearly
foreclosed.
now,
if
there's
any
doubt
about
that,
based
on
the
language
of
the
hobbs
act,
as
amended
in
1948,
one
need
only
look
back
to
the
1946
version
of
the
hobbs
act,
as
originally
passed.
and
there,
it...
there's
no
debate
that
congress
intended
to
cover
acts
or
threats
of
physical
violence
only
if
undertaken
in
furtherance
of
a
plan
or
purpose
to
commit
robbery
or
extortion.
so,
respondent's
position
rises
or
falls
on
the
proposition
that
in
1948,
when
congress
recodified
and
revised
all
of
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code,
it
dramatically
expanded
the
hobbs
act.
this
court,
in
reviewing
revision
and
recodification
statutes,
applies
special
rules
of
construction.
it
requires
the
clear
statement...
or
clear
expression
of
intent
to
make
a
substantive
change;
and,
if
there
isn't
one,
it
assumes
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended.
if
you
look
at
the
revisor's
notes
to
section
1951(a)
in
the
1948
revision,
it's
clear
that
there
is
no
intent
to
make
any
substantive
change.
so,
i
think
the
court
really
doesn't
need
to
go
any
further
on
that
second
issue
to
rule
in
the
petitioner's
favor.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
justice
ginsburg,
i
understand
the
concern,
but
the
seventh
circuit
did
everything
but
resolve
the
issue.
it
says
it
was
resolving
the
issue,
but
it...
at
the
same
time,
it
said
that
it
rejected
our
argument
based
on
the
rule
of
lenity.
it
rejected
our
argument
based
on
the
over
federalization
of
state
crimes.
it
said
that
both...
it
rejected
our
plain
language
argument.
it
went
on
and
on
to
reject
all
the
same
arguments
we're
making
in
this
court.
so,
i
think
if
the
case
were
remanded
to
the
district
court--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--well,
what
the...
what
the
court--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
we
raised
it
both
in
the...
at
the
rehearing
petitions
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
in
the
initial
appeal.
it
did
resolve
the
issue,
insofar
as
it
held
that
the
hobbs
act
may
plausibly
be
read
to
cover
freestanding
acts
for
threats
of
violence.
and
that
holding
is
in
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well,
that
is
what
the--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--the
seventh
circuit
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
it
was
not
finally
resolving
the
question.
but,
justice
scalia,
it,
again
and
again,
went
through
our
arguments
and
rejected
them.
and
then,
at
the
end
of
its
opinion,
it
said
it
would
be
better
to
read
the
statute
at...
take
the
statute
at
face
value,
and
that,
it
suggests,
was
what
respondent's
position
was.
so,
i
think
it
went
as
far
as
it
possibly
could
to
resolve
the
question
and
reject
all
of
the
arguments
that
are
being
made
here.
so,
i
think
it...
to
go
back
to
the
district
court,
it
would
be
a
foregone
conclusion,
and
it
would
just
result
in
further
delay.
this
case
has
gone
on
for
almost--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--20
years.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well,
yes,
it
did
leave
open
the
possibility
that
a
court
might
come
to
the
opposite
conclusion.
but
i
think
if
you're
the
district
court
reading
the
opinion
of
the
seventh
circuit,
i
think
it's
clear
which
way
you're
going
to
have
to
come
out.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--the
court
could
certainly
come
out
that
way
on
prudential
grounds
as
a
reason
to
avoid
deciding
a
hobbs
act
issue.
but,
in
our
view,
the
hobbs
act
question
is
a
fairly
easy
and
straightforward
one.
and
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
is
going
to
create
mischief
if
left
untouched.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
the
seventh
circuit
did
everything
it
could
to
make
it
seem
like
a
plausible
issue,
as
opposed
to
a
very
clear
issue
that
should
be
resolved
in
our
favor.
it
went
out
of
its
way
to
do
that.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
but
i
do
think
a
premise
of
the
remand
for
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
is
that
it's
plausible
to
read
the
statute
this
way.
and
i
think
the
court
could,
and
should,
reverse
that
aspect
of
the
seventh
circuit's
decision.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
we
don't
agree
that
there...
well,
perhaps
your
honor
could
elucidate--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
don't
think
that's
right--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--justice
stevens.
i
think
that
that
does
add
something.
the
argument
is
being
made
in
this
case
that
those
words
are
superfluous
under
our
reading,
but
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
it
would
cover
preparatory
acts
of
violence
that
do
not
rise
to
an
attempt.
we
gave
several
examples--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--no,
do
not
rise
to
an
attempt,
an
attempted
extortion
or
robbery.
the
example
we
gave...
we
gave
several
examples
in
our
blue
brief.
one
of
them
is
a
defendant
who
wants
to
rob
a
factory
and--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--and--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--yes.
yes.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn,
in
my
limited
time,
to
the
third
question,
which
is
the...
whether
rico
authorizes
private
injunctive
relief.
and
we
want
to
make
three
basic...
or
i'd
like
to
make
three
basic--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
correct,
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
court
to
reach
that
issue
this
time,
either.
but
i'd
like
to
just
say
a
few
words
about
that
provision,
because
i
think
we're
right
on
that
issue,
as
well.
and
the
court
can
pick
any
one
of
these
three
grounds
to
rule
in
our
favor.
we'd
be
happy
with
any
of
them.
our
principal
argument
on
rico
is
that
rico's
civil
remedies
provisions
were
drawn
from
the
antitrust
laws,
from
the
clayton
act
and
from
the
sherman
act
before
it.
in
fact,
the
treble
damages
provision
of
rico
is
taken
almost
verbatim
from
the
clayton
act
and
sherman
act
provisions.
this
court,
in
a
long
line
of
cases,
held
that
the
sherman
act
does
not
authorize
private
injunctive
relief.
and
that
holding...
those
holdings
were
based
on
the
provisions
on
which
these
rico
remedial
provisions
were
modeled.
and
so,
we
think
when
congress
took
that
language,
which
is
essentially
identical,
at
least
in
the...
in
the...
in
the
treble
damages
provision,
from
the
antitrust
laws,
that
it
was
entitled
to
assume
that
they
would
be
read
the
same
way
in
rico.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
true,
justice
stevens.
but
i
think
those
provisions
were
carried
forward,
and
congress...
and
this
court's
cases,
again
and
again,
have
relied
on
congress's
use
of
the...
of
the
clayton
and
sherman
act
models.
you've
said
that's
a
dominant
strand
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
i'm
sorry.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
mr.
chief
justice,
we
think
that
franklin
is
distinguishable.
there
are
two
lines
of
this
court's
cases.
franklin
falls
into
one
line.
that's
a
case
where
this
court
finds
a...
or
acknowledges
a
private
right
of
action,
but
where,
necessarily,
there's
no
guidance
from
congress
of
what
the
remedies
are.
and
in
that
situation,
the
court
does
apply
a
presumption
that
all
available
remedies
are...
will
be...
will
be
imputed.
in
this...
in
the
second
line
of
cases,
which
is
what
this
case
is
all
about,
congress
sets
forth
a
detailed
remedial
scheme.
and
in
those
cases,
i
think
it's
inappropriate...
and
this
court
has
said
that
repeatedly...
for
courts
to
add
remedies
to
those
schemes
which
congress
is...
has
selected.
now,
this
is
especially
true
in
this
case,
because
congress
relied
on
those
antitrust
precursors.
and,
beyond
that,
section
16
of
the
clayton
act,
which
expressly
authorizes
private
injunctive
relief,
is...
has
no
analog
in
rico.
now,
congress
thought
about
including
a
provision
like
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
when
it
considered
rico.
again
and
again,
proposals
were
made,
but
congress
did
not
adopt
those
proposals
either
during
the
consideration
of
rico
or
shortly
thereafter.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
want
to
make
a
few
very
quick
points.
first,
i
heard
mr.
chemerinsky
say
that
the
third
clause
was
unnecessary
in
the
hobbs
act,
because
robbery
and
extortion
necessarily
involve
acts
or
threats
of
violence.
i
just
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
hobbs
act
also
covers
official
extortion,
which
does
not
require
acts
or
threats
of
violence.
secondly,
on
the
enmons
point
that
justice
breyer
was
asking
about,
you're
quite
right,
justice
breyer,
that
to
accept
the
other
side's
position
would
effectively
overrule
enmons.
enmons
did
not
rely,
in
any
way,
on
section
1951(c),
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
court's
analysis.
if
you
look
at
section
1951(c),
which
is
reprinted
in
the
scheidler
blue
brief
at
page
2(a),
you'll
see
that
it
just
refers
to
some
labor
statutes.
it
says
that
the
hobbs
act
is
not
meant
to
repeal,
modify,
or
affect
those
laws.
but
those
laws
don't
protect
violent
conduct,
so
that's
a
red
herring.
and,
number
three,
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
court's
last
decision
in
this
case,
the
court
made
clear
that
coercion
is
not
covered
by
the
hobbs
act.
but
under
the
respondent's
reading,
some
acts
of
coercion
would,
in
fact,
be
covered
by
the
hobbs
act.
finally,
we'd
just
like
to
reiterate
our
request
that,
if
the
court
rules
in
our
favor,
it
make
very
clear,
in
remanding
the
case,
that
judgment
should
be
entered
in
favor
of
petitioners.
thank
you.
