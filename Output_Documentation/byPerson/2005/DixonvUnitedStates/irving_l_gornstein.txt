mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
for
three
reasons,
the
burden
of
proving
duress
should
be
on
the
defendant,
and
the
government
should
not
be
required
to
disprove
duress
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
first,
duress
is
an
affirmative
defense
that
excuses
what
would
otherwise
be
serious
criminal
conduct.
when
the
government
proves
that
a
defendant
has
engaged
in
criminal
conduct
and
has
done
so
with
the
mens
rea
specified
by
the
crime,
it
is
fair
to
require
the
defendant
to
prove
that
duress
excuses
that
criminal
conduct,
so
that
here,
the
government
proved
that
petitioner
knew
she
was
lying
when
she
filled
out
the
forms
and
that
she
knew
it
was
unlawful
for
her
to
receive
firearms.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
could
conceivably
be
such
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
if
you
had
a
crime,
for
example,
that
said
someone
who
does
something
while
not
under...
acting
under
duress,
that
would
be
an
obvious
example.
but
there
are--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
would
be
an
easy
example.
[laughter]
but
there...
there
are--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--right.
in...
in
that
kind
of
situation,
the
facts
that
go
to
duress
could
also
go
to
undermining
the
proof
of
the
motive
in
that
case,
and
in
that
situation,
the
government
always
has
to
prove
the
element
of
the
offense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
if
the
defendant
wants
to
add
to
that
a
duress...
a
specific
duress
defense,
then
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
on
the
defendant
to
prove
duress.
now,
normally
in
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
now,
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
government's
position
is
that
on
self
defense,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendant,
but
it
recognizes
that
there
are
important
distinctions
between
self
defense
and
duress
that
could
allow
the
court
to
reach
different
conclusions
about
the
two
defenses.
in
addition
to
the
point
that's
already
been
made
about
the
degree
of
factual
overlap
between
self
defense
on
the
one
hand
and
duress
on
the
other
on
the
basic
crime,
there
are
three
additional
considerations.
one
is
that
the...
the
circuits
and
the
states
are
virtually
uniform
on
self
defense,
whereas
there
is
a
significant
division
of
authority
on
the
question
of
duress.
second,
self
defense
has
always
been
a
more
favored
defense
because
when
the
defendant
acts
legitimately
in
self
defense,
he's
not
harming
an
innocent
person.
but
when
a
defendant
is
actually
under...
acting
under
duress,
that
defendant
is
still
endangering
or
harming
innocent
third
parties.
and
the
third
reason
is
that
there's
always
been
a
significant
degree
of
judicial
skepticism
about
claims
of
duress,
but
there's
never
been
that
same
kind
of
judicial
skepticism
about
self
defense.
so
while
we
do
take
the
position
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
still
on
the
defendant,
the
court
could
take
a
different
view
on
that
issue
and
agree
with
us
on
duress.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
i...
i
think
it's
just
a
federal
common
law
question
here,
and
it's
only
as
good
as
the
reasoning
that
underlies
it.
but
when
you
start
to
see
a
uniform
body
or
a
consensus
of
opinion
on
one
side
of
the
equation,
then
there...
it's
much
more
likely
that
there
are
certain
reasons
that
are
underlying
that
justify
it.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
i
don't
think
davis
was
taking
the
position--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
this
was
the
common
law
when
the
due
process
clause
was
adopted.
davis
took
the
position
that
the
common
law
had
evolved
to
the
point
where
on
the
specific
defense
of
insanity,
that
this
was
the
result
that
should
follow,
that
there
should
be
a
burden
of
production
on
the
defendant,
and
then
the
government
should
have
to
disprove
insanity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
davis
was
not
a
constitutional
holding.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
it
wasn't
a
holding
about
what--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
early
common
law
was--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--because
it's
clear
that
under...
at
the
time
of
the
constitution,
the
burden
of
proof
on
all
of
these
defenses
was
on
the
defendant.
and
that
was
also
true
at
the
time
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted.
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
defendant.
there
was
some
evolution
after
that.
now,
the...
the
other
thing
i
wanted
to
talk
about
with
respect
to
davis
is
it
was
based
on
the
understanding
that
the
court
had
about
the
relationship
between
the
insanity
defense
on
the
one
hand
and
the
mens
rea
element
of
the
crime
on
the
other
hand.
and
here,
there's
simply
no
corresponding
overlap.
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
acted
under
duress,
she
knew
she
was
lying
when
she
filled
out
the
forms,
and
she
knew
it
was
unlawful
for
her
to
purchase
firearms.
so
there's
simply
no
relationship
between
the
duress
defense
and
the
mens
rea
element
of
these
crimes.
congress
has
also
overruled
davis
by
statute,
and
we
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
extend
davis
to
a
new
defense
when
congress
has
rejected
it
with
respect
to
the
only
defense
that
it
applied
to.
and...
and
there's...
and
certainly
congress
acted
constitutionally
in
overruling
the
davis
decision
under
this
court's
decision
in
leland
and
in
other
cases
like
martin
and
patterson,
which
say
that
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
in
putting
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
for
established
common
law
affirmative
defenses.
and--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
and
here's
the
reason.
the...
the
burden
of
proof
on
entrapment
is
actually
on
the
defendant
initially.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
element
of
inducement.
that
is,
there
are
two
elements.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
burden
of
persuasion
on
the
element
of
inducement
is
on
the
defendant.
the
defendant
has
to
prove
more
likely
than
not
that
the
government
induced
this
crime
in
the
sense
that
it
took
actions
that
are
likely
to
override
what
a
innocent
person
would
have
done.
at
that
point,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
government
to
show
that
this
particular
defendant
was
predisposed.
now,
that's
consistent
with
background
common
law
principles
under
which,
once
it's
shown
that
one
party
has
been
engaging
in
wrongful
conduct,
i.e.,
inducement,
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
wrongdoer
to
show
that
its
conduct
did
not
have
its
likely
effect
in
that
case.
and
that's
why
the
government
then
has
to
come
back
and
show
that
with
respect
to
this
particular
individual,
that
particular
individual
was
predisposed,
even
though
we
took
wrongful
actions
that
would
have
induced
an
innocent
person
to
do
this.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that...
that's
true,
but
again,
if
it
was
just
a
matter
of
who
has
access
to
the
relevant
evidence,
then
that
would...
the
burden
should
have
been
on
the
defendant,
that
it
wasn't
just
a
matter
of
that.
there
was
this
other
principle
which
is
that
the...
there
was
already
a
showing...
there's
already
a
showing
that
the
government
has
taken
wrongful
action
to
induce
the
crime.
and
that's
why
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant...
to
the
government
to
show
that
this
particular
person
wasn't
predisposed.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
court--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it...
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
point
you
to
that
shows
there
is
an
empirically
evidence
that
the
government
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
deal
with
this
burden.
but
what
i
would
say
to
you
is
that
you
should
take
the
same
approach
that
the
court
took
in
the
diana
case
many
years
ago,
which
is
it
did
not
want
to
establish
a
regime
that
invites
manufactured
claims.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
breyer--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--let...
let
me
start
with...
i
go
back
to
the
diana
case
because
i
think
the
way
the
court
approached
the
question
in
the
diana
case
is
the
way
this
court
should
approach
it
because
it
dealt
with
the
same
kind
of
defense,
necessity.
and
what
it
wanted...
it
said
this
is
a
defense
where
there
is
a
big
danger
that
this
can
be
manufactured
in
a
way
that
it
is
difficult
to
disprove,
and
we
are
going
to
establish
a
regime
that
doesn't
invite
manufactured
claims
and
that
doesn't
make
it
difficult
for
the
government
to
disprove
something
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
have
a
choice
here,
and
that's
not
the
regime
we
want
to
establish.
we
want
to
establish
a
regime
that
makes
it
more
unlikely
that
manufactured
claims
are
going
to
come
forward
and
that
make
it...
makes
it
more
unlikely
that
if
such
claims
do
come
forward,
the
government
isn't
going
to
be
able...
unable
to
disprove
them
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
compromising
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
take
a
recent
case
in
which
a
defendant
transported
drugs
from
mexico
into
the
united
states,
and
he
claimed
that
he
did
that
because
someone
threatened
his
family
members
in
mexico.
now,
that's
a
case
that
somebody
who
has
deliberately
violated
the
law
would
find
relatively
easy
to
manufacture
that
defense.
yet,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
government
to
disprove
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
yes,
but
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendant,
then
the
government
can
do
what
you
were
talking
about.
it
can
cross
examine
that
person
and
it
can
persuade
the
jury--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if
he
does
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--there
are...
there
are
other--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
true,
justice
breyer,
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
that
it's
one
thing
to
be
able
to
persuade
the
jury
through
cross
examination,
that
that
is
more...
not
more
likely
than
not.
it's
quite
another
thing
to
persuade
the
jury
in
that
kind
of
situation
that
that
defense
is
not
true
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
in
the
ordinary
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
do
not
have
any
statistics.
and,
of
course,
when...
when
somebody
gets
off,
it
results
in...
in
an
acquittal
and
so
we
don't
get
published
decisions
about
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i'm
not
sure
i'll
answer
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the...
the
model
penal
code
takes
the
position
that
every
defense,
affirmative
defense,
goes
on
the
government,
and
that's
just
a
policy
judgment--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
breyer,
i
do
not
know.
i
do
know
it
is
based
in...
in
its
explanation
of
its
rule
for
all
affirmative
defenses,
which
would
include
insanity,
which
congress
has
rejected--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the...
the
burden
of...
the
presumption
of
innocence,
though,
only
applies
to
the
essential
elements
of
the
crime
under
this
court's
decision
in
in
re
winship,
et
cetera,
and
not...
it
doesn't
apply
to
affirmative
defenses,
as
the
court
has
consistently
held
in
martin
and
in
patterson
and
in
leland.
that
is,
the...
it
can
be
constitutionally...
you
can
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
to
prove
an
affirmative
defense,
and
the
constitution
has
nothing
to
say
about
that.
the
presumption
of
innocence
goes
to
all
the
things...
the
essential
elements
of
the
crime.
and
here,
petitioner
benefitted
from
the
presumption
of
innocence.
the
government
had
to
prove
that
she
filled
out
those
forms,
that
she
filled
them
out
with
falsities,
and
that
she
knew
she
was
lying
when
she
filled
out
that...
those
forms.
it
had
to
prove
that
she
received
those
guns
and
that
she
knew
that
it
was
unlawful
for
her
to
receive
those
guns.
and
it
had
to
prove
all
of
those
things
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
on
the
position
of
the
states,
a
significant
number
of
states
are
on--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
don't
think
the
congress
has
enacted
the...
the
model
penal
code.
this...
this
court
sometimes
looks
to
the
model
penal
code
as
one
source
of
what
is...
of...
of
thought
out
there,
but
that's
all.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
purport
it.
and
in
fact,
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i'm
sure.
[laughter]
in
this
particular
case
the
model--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
model
penal
code
said
that
it
was
expanding
the
common
law
defense
of
duress
to
a
new
place
where
it
had
never
been.
so
it's
not
surprising
that
it
would
also
have
a
different
burden
of
persuasion
than
the
traditional
burden
of
persuasion.
now,
on...
on
the
practice
of
the
states,
the
court
has
never
take
the
view
that
it
is
just
going
to
do
a
nose
count
and
figure
out
what
the
best
rule
is
based
on
the
practice
of
the
states.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i'm
not
remembering
the...
the
exact...
i
think
it's
in
the
'70's,
though.
but
would
we...
would
our...
would
our
nose
count
be
today
or
would
our
nose
count
be
when
the
criminal
statute
was--
--no.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
think
that
the
court
should
do
that
kind
of
nose
counting
based
on
whether
a
statute
was
enacted
in
1800,
1850,
1900,
1950
and
potentially
have
different
rules
for
each
statute.
we
think
that
the
court
should
look
at
the
entire--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
don't
think
it's
right
to
say
that
it
adopted
the
prevailing
view
unless
it
was
a
consensus
view.
i
don't
think,
though--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
i
think
the...
i
think
that
the
problem
with
that
approach
is
to
have
a
completely
different
rule
for
all
the
different
statutes
based
on
when
they
were
enacted
is
unmanageable
and
impractical.
and
the
court
has
said
the
same
thing
in
the
context
of
mens
rea
requirements.
the
court
doesn't
import
into
statutes
the
mens
rea
requirement
that
was
in
vogue
at
a
particular
time.
what
it
does
now
is
it
imports
into
all
criminal
statutes
that
do
not
specify
a
mens
rea
requirement...
it
simply
imports
in
a
knowledge
requirement,
that
there
has
to
be
knowing
action.
and
that
would
be
true
regardless
of
whether
it's
an
1800
statute,
an
1850
statute,
a
1900
statute,
or
a
today
statute.
and
i
think
that
the
reason
for
that
is
one
of
practicality
and
administrability
which
the
court
has
talked
about,
in
fact,
in...
in
other
cases.
the
bailey
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i...
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
breakdown,
but
i
think
that
there
are...
there
are
possibly
something
like
10
or
so
states
on...
that
have
adopted
it
by
statute,
but
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
number
of
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes,
after
the
defendant--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
more
likely
than
not,
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
more
likely
than
not.
and
that...
the...
the
court
in
the
diana
case,
actually
in
the
context
of
forfeiture,
thought
that
a
beyond...
the
defendant
should
have
to
show
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
we...
and
we...
we
would
take
a
step
back
from
that,
consistent
the
practice
in
the
circuits
that
have
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
and
the
states
that
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
and
the
burden
of
proof
that...
that
congress
has
specified
when
it
has
thought
about
what
the
burden
of
proof
should
be
outside
the
context
of
insanity--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--for
all
of
the
affirmative
defenses,
i
think
that's
the...
the
leland
decision
would
allow
a
state
to
do
that.
leland
said
that
you
could
put...
require
the
defendant
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable...
i'm
sorry.
is
it
leland?
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
so
that
there
is...
there
would
be
no
constitutional
problem
in
putting
a...
a
burden
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
the
duress
defense
either.
and
in
fact,
this
is
a
defense
that
congress
could...
could
eliminate
altogether,
if
it
wanted
to,
and
just
take
the
position
that
it's
going
to...
these...
this
kind
of
excuse
would
be
considered
along
with
all
other
kinds
of
excuses
in
either
making
a
charging
decision
or...
or
making
a
sentencing
decision.
there
is
no
constitutional
imperative
that
there
be
a
duress
defense
at
all.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
same
is
true
of
the...
the
insanity
defense
that
the
congress
could
take
the
position.
it
hasn't
taken
that
position,
but
it
could
take
the
position,
that
this
is
a
defense
that
will
be
considered,
along
with
other
excuses,
in...
by
prosecutors
as
they
make
charging
decisions
and
by
sentencing
judges
as
they
make
sentencing
judgments.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the...
the
same
would
be
true
of
self
defense,
again,
that
the...
the
government...
no
state
has
ever
taken
that
position
and
the
congress
hasn't
taken
that
position,
and
it
would
be
very
much
against
all
the
traditions
that
are...
that
we
have.
but
if
a
state
made
a
policy
judgment
to
that
effect,
that
this
is
the
policy...
we
want
to
encourage
people
to
retreat,
we
do
not
want
to
encourage
people
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands,
but
what
we
will
do
is
we
will
recognize
this
and
we
are
sure
our
prosecutors
are
going
to
recognize,
we're
sure
our
judges
going
to
recognize
it
as
a...
a
mitigating
factor.
and
that
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that
it...
it
fits
the
defense
and
that
you
can
draw
a
distinction
between
excuse
and
justification,
but
i
don't
think
the
distinction
ultimately
matters
whether
you
call
it
an
excuse
or
justification.
it's
still
the
burden
of
proof
should
be
on
the
defendant
and
it
shouldn't...
the
nomenclature
shouldn't
matter.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mistake
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--yes.
mistake
is
something
that
negatives
the
mens
rea
requirement
of
knowledge.
so,
of
course,
the
government
has
to
prove
knowledge
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
if
somebody
has
mistake,
then
the
government
isn't
going
to
be
able
to
satisfy
its
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
if
it
does
negative
mens
rea...
and
this
is
infrequent,
but
if
it
does,
then
the
government,
of
course,
has
to
prove
its
element
of
the
offense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
if
duress
evidence
undermines
the
government's
ability
to
do
that,
then
the
government
hasn't
proven
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
