which
is
the
easier
of
the
two
cases
for
the
defendant?
a,
the
case
where
the
argument
is
a
burden
of
proof
should
be
on...
on
the...
the
state
as
a
due
process
matter
or
a
common
law
matter
in
an
insanity
defense
and,
b,
in
a
duress
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
either
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
we've
held,
at
least
under
the
mcnaughton
version
of
the
defense,
that
the
state...
that
the
burden
can
be
put
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
he
was
not
insane
under
the
mcnaughton--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
as
justice
scalia
said
and
as
i
was
considering
in
asking
my
question,
in
your
case
we
know
that
there
was
a
conscious,
knowing
and
intentional,
in
some
sense,
act
when...
when
the
person
bought...
bought
the
weapons.
she
says
the
intent,
of
course,
was
induced
by...
by
the
threat.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
more
difficult
case
than
in
the
insanity
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
phrase
justice
harlan
used
in
the
davis
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
is
the
threshold
test
that
the
defendant
has
to
cross
before
the
judge
will
give
the
instruction
to
the
jury?
obviously,
the
burden
of
production
is
with
the
defendant.
when
can
a
judge
say,
well,
you
know,
this...
this
is
just
too
flimsy
for
a
duress
defense?
i'm
not
going
to
instruct
a
jury
on
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
could
almost
argue
that
the
other
way.
i
mean,
it...
it
seems
to
me
on
predisposition
that
the
defendant
knows
more
about
it
than
the
government
does.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
what
the
criteria
are
that
i
have
to
follow...
that
we
have
to
follow
in
deciding
the
case.
just
count
up
all
the
cases
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
ask...
let
me
ask
you
this.
is...
is
there
any
evidence
that...
that
we
can
take
account
of,
commentary,
law
reviews,
to
show
that
the
government
has
difficulties
in...
in
meeting
a
duress
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
the
test
proposed
by
the
petitioner
that...
that
you
have
to
prove
nonduress
by
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
test
is
that
the
defendant
would
have
to
prove
it
only
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
more
likely.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
a
state
could
put
a
burden
on
the
defendant
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
entrapment,
duress,
insanity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
the
judge
ask
the
defendant
to
produce
evidence
that
there
was
no
possibility
to
go
to
law
enforcement
officials,
and
if
she
does
not
produce
that
evidence,
then
refuse
to
give
the
defense?
