mr.
jett,
do
i
take
it,
from
what
you've
just
said,
that
you
are
recognizing
this
is
a
question
of
federal
common
law
and
not
due
process,
so
that
if
congress
placed
the
burden
on
the
defendant,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
infirmity?
you're
just
arguing
that
this
is
the
federal
common
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you...
then
you
think
that
congress
could
not
say
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
on
the
question
of
duress.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jett,
there's
one
piece
of
this
picture
that's
different...
that
distinguishes
duress
from,
say,
self
defense.
if
it's
self
defense,
you
take
a
snapshot
on
the
scene.
you
know
exactly
what
happened.
no
one
taking
a
picture
of
these
gun
purchases
would
have
any
idea
of
all
of
this.
and
the
judge,
when
asked
to
give...
to
allow
the
defense
of
duress,
said,
it's
frankly
a
close
call
in
my
mind,
but
when
it
is
a
close
call,
better
give
it
than
not.
now,
he
thought
that
the
defendant
would
have
the
burden
of
proof.
perhaps
the
judge
would
call
that
close
question
the
other
way
if
he
thought
he
was
saddling
the
prosecution
with
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
based
on
the
defendant's...
the
prosecution's
conduct.
the
government's
conduct
in
entrapment
concerns
how
the
government
behaved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
government
is
out
there
trying
to
achieve
that
result,
it's
quite
different
from
the
government
having
nothing
to
do--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--doesn't
that
come
from
an
underlying
principle
that
your
position
is
not
entirely
consistent
with,
that
is,
that
the
defendant
is
presumed
innocent?
so
it's
not
as
justice
scalia
may
have
suggested
that,
well,
he
would
plead
guilty,
but
we're
going
to
let
him...
we
presume
that
the
defendant
is
innocent.
that's
why
the
prosecutor
has
to
have
the
burden
on
all
issues.
i
thought
that
was
the
underlying
principle.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
insanity
defense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
self
defense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
take
into
account
that
this
was
not
something
that
occurred
at
once?
this
was
a
long
term
relationship.
there
were
many
opportunities
in
which
she
might
have,
when
her
children
were
with
the
grandmother,
say,
gone
to
the
police.
