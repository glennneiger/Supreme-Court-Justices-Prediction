justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
doesn't
vicious
will
mean
simply
the
will
to
commit
the
crime?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
vicious?
i
mean,
that
the
person
is...
is
nasty,
that
the
person
is
antisocial
or
asocial?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know
what
the
added
element
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
when
you...
when
you
say
freely
choosing,
what
you
mean,
i
take
it,
is
choosing
with...
without
consideration
of
pressure
from
a
third
party.
that's
what
you
mean,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the...
the
third...
the
third
party
may,
indeed,
exert
pressure,
but
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
it
is
still
the
decision
of
the
defendant
whether
to
cave
in
to
that
pressure
or
not,
whether
to
commit
the
crime
or
not
to
commit
the
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i
don't
want
to
get
lost
in...
in
rhetoric
here.
isn't
it
still
the
case,
even
on
your
theory,
that
the
defendant
in
these
circumstances
makes
a
choice?
it
may
be
a
troubled
choice,
a
much
more
difficult
choice
to
make
than
it
would
be
otherwise,
but
the
defendant
still
makes
a
choice
as
to
whether
to
cave
in
to
the
third
party's
pressure
or
not,
whether
to
commit
the
crime
or
not.
isn't
that
true
even
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
are
you
making
the
argument
that
this
number
indicates
a
congressional
intent
and
that
what
we
ought
to
do
is
come
up
with
a
rule
because
congress
intended
it?
or
are
you
making
the
argument
that
yours
is
the
better
rule,
and
as
a
matter
of
common
law,
which...
which
it
is
our
responsibility
to
develop,
we
should
see
it
your
way?
which
argument
are
you
making?
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is...
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
you
off.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was...
you
have
a
tougher
argument,
don't
you,
when
you...
when
you
face
the
comparison
between
duress
here
and
entrapment
because
it's...
it's
quite
true
in...
in
entrapment
you're
talking
about
the
actions
of
a...
of
a
third
party
which
is
causing
something,
but
the...
the
ultimate
determination
that
has
to
be
made
is
a
determination
about
the...
in
effect,
the...
the
inclination,
the
willingness,
the
readiness
of
the
defendant
to
have
committed
the
act.
and...
and
yet,
i
take
it,
it's...
it's
assumed
that
so
far
as
the
entrapment
defense
is
concerned,
the
burden
is
on
the
government.
so
if
the
burden
is
on
the
government
in
what
is
a...
a
somewhat
difficult
issue
for
the
government
to
carry
the
burden
on
in
entrapment,
wouldn't
coherence
suggest
that
a
fortiori
it
ought
to
be
on...
on
duress?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
the
burden
of
persuasion.
