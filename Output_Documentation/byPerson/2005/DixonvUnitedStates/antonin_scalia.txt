i
would
think
that
it's
easier
in...
you
know,
we
had...
we
had
a...
this
term
another
case
in
which
the
argument
is
that
you
cannot
have
a
separate
insanity
defense
essentially
and...
and
exclude
from
the
mens
rea
element
of
a
crime
the...
the
lack
of...
of
mental
capacity
to...
to
have
that
mens
rea.
this
is
the
same
thing
you're
arguing
before
us.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
applies
to
duress,
it
applies
even...
even
more
strongly
to...
to
insanity.
how
can
an
insane
person
form
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime
that...
that
requires
mens
rea?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
her
will
to
yield
to
the
will
of
someone
else.
i
mean,
you
can't
blame
somebody
else
for
her
making
the
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be
a
very
intelligent
choice
on
your
part
to
do
what
the
person
with
the
gun
at
the
head
of
your
children
tells
you
to
do.
but
to
say
that
it's
not
your
choice,
which
is
what
you're
arguing
here,
the
only
question
is
whether
that
has
to
be
brought
forward
by
reason
of...
of
a
defense
of...
of
coercion
or
rather,
whether
it
goes
to
whether
you
had
the
intent.
that's
all
we're
talking
about
here.
and
it
seems
to
me
you
have
the
intent
to
yield
to...
to
the
demand
of
whoever
has
the
gun
at
the
head
of
your
children.
it's
a
separate
question
whether
the
law
should
punish
your
yielding
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
you're
telling
us
that
you
don't
have
the
intent
to...
to
yield
and...
and
to
do
whatever
criminal
act
that
person
tells
you.
right?
that
just
doesn't...
i
just
don't
think
it's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
have
21
states
and
how
many
circuits--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
i'm
saying
how
many
are
on
the
other
side?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's...
that's
sort
of
a
horse
race.
i'm...
i'm
not
sure,
even
if
i
agreed
with
your
theory,
that...
that
what
the
constitution
requires
changes
on
the
basis
of
an
evolving
common
law.
of
course,
it
can
only
change
in
one
direction.
right?
it
can
only
change
favorably
to...
to
your
client,
favorably
to
the
defendant.
it
can't
change
to
be
more
harsh
to
the
defendant
because
the
constitution
prohibits
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
so...
so
we
have
a
one
way...
a
one
way
altering
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even...
even
if
i
agreed
with
that,
i'm
not
sure
that,
you
know,
21
versus
14
is...
is
an
overwhelming
demonstration
of...
of
the
new
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
29
versus
14.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jett,
a
thought
occurred
to
me,
by
reason
of
your
agreement,
that...
that
it's
a
one
way
ratchet,
that
when
the
common
law
changes
in
the...
in
the
direction
of
favoring
the
defendant,
it
becomes
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
allow
that.
but,
of
course,
it
can't
change
in
the
other
direction
because
the
constitution
would
prevent
it.
you
sort
of
agreed
with
that.
but...
but
if...
if
you
agree
with
that,
how
can
you
explain
our...
our
1895
decision
in
davis
which
held
that
the
insanity
defense
had
to
be
proved
by
the
government
which
was
then
overridden
by
a
federal
statute.
how
could...
how
could...
if...
if
davis
was
right
about
what
the...
what
the
common
law
required,
how
could
congress
possibly
have
changed
that
by
a
statute?
i
would
assume
that
all
of
the
basic
elements
of
the
common
law
are
picked
up
in
the
due
process
clause.
why
wouldn't...
why
wouldn't
the
necessity
of...
of
proving
the
mental
element
of
a...
of
a
crime,
even
when
that
mental
element
is
overcome
by
insanity,
why
wouldn't
that
have
been
embodied
in
the
due
process
clause
so
that
the
congressional
statute
would
have
been
ineffective?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
not
questioning
whether
we
could
do
it.
i'm
questioning
whether
congress
could
do
it,
whether
congress
could
overrule
what
we
did
in
davis.
if
davis
said
that
common
law
was
that
the
government
has
to
prove...
disprove
insanity,
wouldn't
that
have
been
part...
become
part
of
the
due
process
clause
if
it
was
the
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
makes
me
suspect
that
davis
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
good
catch.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
wouldn't...
wouldn't
have
to
disprove
duress
in
the
hate
case.
it
would
just
have
to
prove
hate.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
the
extent
that
duress
undermines
that,
it
would
be
a
defense
considered
by
the
jury
on
the
hate
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
if
you're
a
judge
like
me
who...
who
thinks
that
any
significant
element
of...
of
the
criminal
law,
when
the
due
process
clause
was...
was
adopted,
remains
in
effect
and
it
doesn't
change
with
the
times
as
you
seem...
as
your
last
comment
seems
to
have
said?
what
do
i
do
with
a
case
like
davis?
not
a
case
like.
what
do
i
do
with
davis?
davis
tells
me
that
this
was
the
common
law
when
the
due
process
clause
was
adopted.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
know
it
was
not
a
constitutional
holding,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'll
have
to
go
back
and
look
at
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
in
the
vast
majority
of
criminal
cases,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
person
did
the
crime.
and
so
the...
the
benefit
to
the
government
is
just
carrying
coals
to
newcastle.
the...
the
defendant
would
plead
guilty
but
for
the
fact
that
he
has
a
plausible
coercion
defense,
and
so
he
puts
that
coercion
defense
before
the
jury,
and
oh,
sure,
he
does
let
the...
the
government
cross
examine
him.
but
the
government
really
doesn't
need
his
cross
examination
in
the
ordinary
case.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i...
i
guess
the
only
way
we
could
really
tell
what
the
consequences
are,
as
justice
breyer
would...
would
like
us
to
be
able
to
tell,
is
to
know
how
many
people
who
have
gotten
off
on
the
basis
of
this
defense
have
gone
on
to
continue
a
life
of
crime.
and...
and
we
don't
have
any
stats
on
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
never
know
the
consequences
of
our
decisions,
by
and
large,
do
we?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
who...
who
develops
the
model
penal
code?
is
that
the
american
law
institute
that
does
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
once
upon
a
time
purported
to
simply
be
embodying
the...
the
general
law,
the
common
law.
but
it
doesn't
even
purport
to
do
that
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
a
lot
of
law
professors
involved
in
it,
aren't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gornstein,
just
out
of
curiosity,
of
the
29
states
that
have
the
different
rule,
in
how
many
of
those
states
was
the
different
rule
adopted
legislatively
and
in
how
many
states
was
it
pronounced
by
the
state
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
your...
your
friend
on
the
other
side
knows.
justice
antonin
scalia
clear
and
convincing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
three...
three
was
what?
three
states
that
have
adopted
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
it's
less...
less
blameworthy.
i
mean,
if
somebody
has
a
gun
to
the
head
of
my
child
and
i
have
a
choice
between
doing
a
criminal
act
that
he
wants
me
to
do
and
shooting
him,
you
think
it's...
the
less
blameworthy
is
to
go
do
the
criminal
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
kill
him.
i'd
just
wound
him.
[laughter]
