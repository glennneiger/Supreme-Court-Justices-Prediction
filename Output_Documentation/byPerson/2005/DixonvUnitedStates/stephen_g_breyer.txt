justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
is
this
worse
in
that
respect?
and
lots
of
things
in
the
case
that
you
have
to
prove
may
be
hard
to
prove
because
it
requires
finding
out
what
someone
said
to
the
defendant
over
the
telephone,
what
happened
4
years
ago
in
a
room
where
the
defendant
was
the
only
one
now
alive
present.
there
are
lots
of
cases
like
that.
traditionally
in
the
law,
i
take
it,
it's
been
that
most
instances
where
the
defendant
excuses
his
conduct
on
the
ground
he
wasn't
morally
culpable,
mistake,
accident,
self
defense.
entrapment?
not...
that's
a
different
kind
of
ground.
this
one?
evidence
mixed.
but
you
have
to
prove
lots
of
things
where
it's
really
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant,
and
the
defendant
saying
i'm
so
innocent
because
i'm
not
morally
culpable.
i
was
asleep.
i
was...
you
know,
we
can
imagine.
so
i
don't
see
why
this
is
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
i
would
look...
i
guess
if
we're
supposed
to
get
the
better
rule,
the
first
place
i'd
look
is
what
did
the
model
penal
code
think.
they
think
you
should
have
the
burden.
then
i
think
has
this
turned
into
a
practical
problem
in
the
29
states
that
have
had
it
for
20
to
40
years.
and
you
say
we
don't
have
any
evidence
to
that
effect.
now,
i've
listed
about
four
things
here,
and
i'd
like
your
response
to
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
we're
thinking
of
things
logically,
logically
you're
right.
i
can
see
that
this
is
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant.
but
i've
wondered
why
hasn't
this
turned
into
evidence
of
a
problem
in
the
29
states.
and
the
following
occurred
to
me,
which
i'll
put
to
you
to
see
what
your
reaction
is.
the
defense
has
to
do
something
if
they
are
going
to
put
duress
in
issue.
they
have
to
get
the
defendant
to
testify.
so
the
prosecutor
has
something
that
the
prosecutor
doesn't
ordinarily
get.
he
has
that
defendant
right
on
the
stand,
ready
for
jury
evaluation.
and
that
is
something
a...
a
prosecutor
may
want,
and
it's
something
the
defense
lawyer
may
not
want.
he
has
to
choose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
when
you
get
into
the
practicalities
of
it,
i
see
things
both
ways,
and
i'd
like
to
find
some
evidence
of
what's
actually
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
if
does
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
has
a
few
other
things,
the
prosecutor.
he
has
that
defendant
on
the
stand.
there
was
an
implication
that
you
were
in
chicago
at
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
you
on
the
night
of
such
and
such?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
an
advantage
for
the
prosecutor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
why
this
is
problematic.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
have
the
experience
as
a
criminal
lawyer
that
allows
me
to
say
whether
it
would
be
one
way
or
the
other.
you're
saying...
and
i'll
repeat
that.
is
there
anything
at
all
i
could
look
to
try
to
figure
this
out?
because
i
think
it
is
a
question
we're
supposed
to
get
the
better
rule.
what
did
the
model
penal
code
authors
do?
did
they
take
testimony--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--did
they
have
evidence
or
did
they
have...
take
testimony?
did
they
go
around
trying
to
find
out
how
prosecutors
and
defense
attorneys...
you
know.
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
mistake?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
was
a
deer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
would
you
distinguish
between
instances
of
duress
where
it
may
a
negative
mens
rea
and
instances
where
it
may
not?
