mr.
j.
craig
jett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
this
case,
the
parties
agree
that
federal
courts,
including
this
court,
have
addressed
nonstatutory
defenses
for
almost
200
years
and
that
congress,
in
enacting
criminal
law
statutes,
legislate
against
a
background
of
anglo
saxon
common
law,
such
that
a
defense
of
duress
was
likely
contemplated
by
congress
when
it
passed
the
gun
control
statutes.
it
is,
therefore,
required
that
courts
apply
defenses,
such
as
the
duress
defense,
based
on
the
background
principle
of
construction
that
the
prosecution
must
prove
criminal
intent
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
government
would
have
this
court
discount
the
development
of
over
110
years
of
common
law
that
has
produced
a
substantial,
well
established,
well
reasoned
majority
rule
in
both
state
and
in
federal
courts
that
places
the
burden
on
the
government
to
disprove
the
absence
of
duress
once
that
defense
has
been
raised
by
the
evidence.
the
development
of
the
majority
rule
began
with
this
court's
decision
in
davis
v.
united
states
in
1895.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
our...
our
first
issue
and
our
first
contention
is
that
federal
common
law
will
govern
the
decision
in
this
particular
case,
but
we
also
have
a
due
process
point
that
we
also
believe
is
germane.
but--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--we
think
that
congress
could
not
under
the...
the
precedents
of
this
court
and
under
the...
the
basic
common
law
construction
that's
fundamental,
i
think,
to
the...
to
the
criminal
law
in
this...
in
this
country.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
we
understand
about
martin
v.
ohio,
your
honor,
and
we
think
that...
that
based
on
recent
precedents,
martin
v.
ohio
should
be
reconsidered.
the...
the
significant
issue
is
that
duress
is
based
on
the
fact
that
there...
that
there
must
be
free
will,
and
if
free
will
is
dispensed
with,
in
this
case
by
duress,
then
the...
the
defendant
doesn't
have
the
requisite
criminal
intent.
and...
and
in
our...
and
since
the
beginning
of...
since
before
the
beginning
of
common
law
in...
in
our
system,
it
has
been
recognized
that
in
order
to
have
a
criminal...
a
crime,
there
have
to
be
two
things,
one,
a
vicious
will
and
the
other
an
act...
an
evil
act
concurrent
with
the
vicious
will.
and--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--well,
we
think
that
in...
that
in
every
criminal
case,
with
possibly
the
exception
of...
of
public
welfare
cases,
that...
that
there
is
an
underlying
background
construction
for
our
criminal
law,
which
requires
the
government
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
criminal
intent.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
which
is
easier
for
the
state?
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
we...
we
contend
that
in
a...
a...
duress
is...
is
different.
insanity
deals
with
really
the
internal
workings
of
somebody's
mind,
so
that's
perhaps
more
difficult
for
the
state.
but
in
a...
in
a
duress
case,
you're
dealing
not
only
with
the
internal
workings
but
also
external
factors
as
well...
as
well
that
impose
somebody
else's
will
upon
the
defendant.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
we...
we
agree
that...
i
agree...
we
agree
that
an
insane
person
cannot
form
that
particular
intent.
we
think
that
they
are
similar
except
that
the
duress
case
is
perhaps
easier
for
the...
for
the
defense
because
we
have
external
factors
that
often
bear
on
what
the
defense
is
unlike--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--well,
we...
and
we
understand
that,
and
again,
our--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--well,
our...
our...
we
think
that
they're...
that
they're
similar
because
both
deal
with...
with
the
mental
state,
and...
and
then
historically,
at
least
since...
since
1895
in
this
court,
this
court
has
said
that
you've
got
to
have
the
vicious
will
in
order
to
constitute
a
crime.
and
so
you
have
the
same
issue
here.
did
mrs.
dixon
have
the
vicious
will
or
was
she
acting
under
the
will
of
someone
else?
mr.
j.
craig
jett
actually,
no.
it
means
the...
the
criminal
intent,
not
just
to
commit
the
crime
but
having
the
criminal
intent,
the
vicious
mind,
to
violate
the
law.
mrs.
dixon's--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--no.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
the...
this...
this
court
has...
has
frequently
equated
the
vicious
will
with
moral
blameworthiness,
that
is,
the
desire
to
do
wrong,
that
is,
the
desire
to
do
something...
to...
the
free
desire
based
on
the...
the
choice
of
having...
being
able
to
do
the
right
thing
or
do
the
wrong
thing
and
freely
choosing
to
do
the
wrong
thing,
that
is,
moral
blameworthiness.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
we
believe
that
would
not
be
a
voluntary
act.
certainly
the
defendant
makes
that
decision.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
yes,
it
is
true.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
but
the
difference
is,
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
souter,
that
the
defendant
is
not
acting
of
her
own
free
will.
she's...
she's
acting
based
on
the
will
of
someone
else,
that
that
person
has
overborne
her
will.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
we...
we
would
respectfully
disagree,
judge.
she
believed
that
there
was
figuratively
a
gun
at
the
head
of
her
children,
and
if
somebody
puts
a
gun
to
the
head
of
my
child,
you
can
make
me
do
almost
anything
that
you
want.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--what...
what
we're
saying
and
what
i
think
that
this
court...
the
precedents
of
this
court
have
said
is
that
you
have
to
have
criminal
intent.
that
is
the
vicious
will
that...
that
the
court...
justice
harlan
talked
about
in
davis
and
this
court
has
talked
about
in
morissette.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
on...
on
seven
or
eight
of
the
counts,
it's
knowingly.
well,
actually
on
the
first
count
it's
knowingly,
but
that
is
defined
as...
as...
in
this
case,
it
was
defined
as
voluntarily
and
intentionally.
and
then
in
the
other
counts,
it
was
simply
defined
as
knowingly.
and
so,
indeed,
that...
that's...
that
is
what
the
congress
said.
however,
based
on
the...
the
precedents
of
this
court,
that
even
when
there
is
a
knowingly
culpable
mental
state
provided
by
congress,
this
court
has
impart...
imported
the...
the
criminal
intent
to...
into
the
statute.
and
so
like
in...
for
instance,
in
morissette,
which
was
a
theft
case,
what
this
court
did
was
the
congress
had
said
knowingly
didn't
provide
a...
a
criminal
intent.
so
this
court
imported
one
and
said
that
the
court...
that
the
government
had
to
prove
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
once
the
defense
was
raised,
it
became
an
element
that
the
government
has
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
it's
really
no
different
than
any
other
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
in...
in
any
case,
for
instance,
a
self
defense
case,
the
government
has
got
to
prove
that...
disprove
self
defense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
once
it's
raised.
they
do
it
in
the
same
way
they
do
in
the
other
case.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
we...
we
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
and
this
case
is
a
very
good
example
of...
of
that...
of
that
circumstance.
the
government...
early
on
in
this
case,
they
searched
mrs.
dixon's
apartment
and
found
evidence.
they...
they
interviewed
her.
they
actually
interviewed
the
abusers
prior
to
trial
before
we
gave
them
notice.
they...
they
were
able
to
investigate
her
background
partially
before
we
gave
notice,
partially
afterwards,
so
that
they
were
able
to...
to
investigate
her
and
circumstances
of
her
life.
but
not
only
that,
they
were
able
to
call
as
witnesses
the
seven
gun
dealers
from
which
the
guns
were
purchased
who
witnessed
the
purchase
and
who
did
provide
testimony
that
she
did
not
appear
to
be
under
duress,
and
they
so
testified.
so
in
this
particular
case,
it's
really
just
like
in
the
other
cases.
you
can
certainly
imagine
a
circumstance
where
that
would
be
hard,
but
in
very
many
cases,
the
facts
are
there
just
like
a
self
defense
case
or,
for
that
matter,
just
like--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--well,
what...
what
she
was
in
duress
about
is
she
was
told
at
the
time
that
there
was
somebody
at
home
with
a
gun
who
was
just
a
cell
phone
call
away.
so
as
far
as
she
was
concerned,
there
was
somebody
there
with
a
gun
to
the
head
of
her
children
and
she
was
in
fear
of
her
children's
life.
in
terms
of
what...
what
the
government
knew
in
this
particular
case,
the
government
had
notice.
the
trial
judge
required
that
we
provide
notice
of
a
defense.
the
trial
judge
required
that
if
we...
said
that
if
we
had
an
expert,
we
had
to
give
the
government
notice
of
the
expert
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
testimony
of
the
expert.
so
the
government
was
very
well
informed
prior
to
trial
what
the
defense
was
so
that
they
hired
their
own
expert
who
actually
was
able
to
interview
the...
the
accused
without
me
being
there
and...
and
so
was
prepared
to
testify
about
the
issues
of
duress.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
the...
the
first
thing
the
judge
would
have
to
determine
is
that
has...
has
there
been
evidence
of
each
of
the
elements
of
duress,
and
the
trial
judge
found
that
we...
we
produced
evidence
of
each
of
the
elements
of
the
duress.
the...
in...
in
the
circuit
court
cases,
they've
not
been
consistent,
but
we
would...
we
would
suggest
that
the...
the
standard
would
be
that
there
would
be
sufficient
evidence,
when
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
defendant,
that
would
raise
a
reasonable
doubt
with
a
rationale
jury,
sort
of
the...
the
other
side
of...
of
the
prosecution's
burden
that
they
have
to
reach
in
order
to
get
to
the
jury.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
i
think
you've
got
to
look
at
two
points
in
time.
and
certainly
we
agree.
we
don't
look
at
the
old
common
law
because...
because
there's
been
110
years
of...
of
development
of
common
law
in
this
country
since
davis
v.
united
states.
so
i
think
the
court
has
got
to
look
at...
at
what
the
common
law
was
at
the
time
that
the
relevant
statute
was
passed,
which
in
this
case
was
1968.
but
i
think
in
addition
to
that,
there...
there
have
been
amendments
to
the
statute.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--no,
because
i
think
the...
i
think
you
have
to
consider
that.
but
the
other
thing
you'd
have
to
consider
is
the
development
of
the
common
law
since
that
time
and
what...
what
courts
have
done,
what
the
rationale
has
been
that
they
have
employed
over
time.
and
in
this
particular
case,
for
instance,
we
have...
we
have
six
federal
circuits
and
29
states
who
have
found
that
the
burden
of
proof...
the
burden
of
production
should
be
on
the
defendant,
but
the
burden
of
persuasion
should
be
on...
on
the
government
to
disprove
duress
once
it's
raised.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
six
circuits
and
29
states,
justice
scalia.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
on
the
other
side
of
the
circuits,
we
count
three;
on
the
states,
we
count
14.
some
states
have
not
addressed
the
issue.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
we
would
agree--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--well--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--but,
justice
scalia,
it's
29
versus
14.
and...
but
it's--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--but
it's
clearly
a
2
to
1
majority
in
favor
of
placing
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
the
government.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
we're...
we're
basing
our
argument
primarily
on...
on
the
common
law
that
has
been
developed
in...
in
this
country
since
really
davis
v.
united
states
through
the
present
and
has...
has--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--in
my
mind
it
would
be...
if
it's
a
close
question,
i
don't
think
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
particular
circumstance
would
make
a
difference
because
it
still
is...
because
he
would
then
be
taking
it
away
from
the
jury.
and
in
my
experience,
judges
are...
are
not
want
to
take
the
questions
away
from
the
jury,
and
they
will
provide
the...
the
jury
instruction
in
a
close
case.
and
that
would
be
the
right
thing
to
do
because
ultimately
we
want
the
jury
to
make
that
decision.
but
the...
but
the
judge
does
have
a
gatekeeping
function
in...
in
a
duress
defense,
so
that
a
judge...
in
any
circumstance,
if
the
judge
decided
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
get
to
the
jury,
the
judge
can
make
that
determination
so
that
you
have
the
trial
court
acting
with
the...
the...
to
make
sure
that
what
the
jury
is
going
to
hear
is...
is
an
issue
for
which
there
is
evidence.
so
i
think
that
the
gatekeeping
function
that
the
trial
court
would...
would
prevent
there
from
being...
juries
making
a
decision
on
insufficient
facts.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
two
reasons.
one,
davis
was
a
common
law
case,
and...
and
subsequently
in
leland
v.
oregon,
this
court
said
davis
was
a
common
law
case.
and
so
this
court
can
decide
the
common
law
issue
with
respect
to
the
constitution.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
i
think...
i
think
that
if
it...
if
it
does
become
part
of
the
due
process,
then
obviously
congress
cannot
overrule
it.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
if
it
simply
becomes
the
common
law...
the
rule
of...
of
the
federal
courts
that
this
court
has...
has
established
based
on
its
supervisory
powers,
then
the
congress
would
be
able
to
do
that.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
the
thing
about
davis
that
even
though
the...
the
insanity
holding
about
davis
was
overruled,
the
core
holdings
of
davis
was
not
overruled.
and
one
of
the
things
that
davis
said
was
that,
again,
to
constitute
a
crime
against
human
laws,
there
must
be
the
vicious
will
and,
secondly,
the
unlawful
act.
the
other
thing
that
davis
said,
which
was
very
significant,
is
that
the
plea
of
not
guilty
is
not
like
in
a
civil
case
where
there's
confession
and
avoidance.
what
it
does
is
it
negates
or
it
controverts
all
of
the
allegations
of...
of
the
state,
and
so
that
it
controverts
the
existence
of
each
fact
that
the
state
has
to
prove.
if
it...
if
it,
indeed,
does
that
and
what
duress
does
is
it
negates
the
evil...
the
evil
intent,
then...
then
the
government
has
got
to
prove
that
there's
criminal
intent.
it's
got
to
negate
one
of
the
elements
that
the
government
has
got
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
that's...
that...
that's
part
of
the
holding
of
davis,
and
the
congress
has
not
affected
that
with
its
decision
on
the
insanity
defense.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
congress
has...
has
never
ruled
on
the
duress
defense.
i
think
a
few
years
ago,
there...
there
was
a
proposal
to...
to
amend
the
federal
criminal
code,
and
in
that
particular...
it
didn't
pass
but
i
think
the
result
of
that
was
that
congress
just
took
out
the
duress
provision
and
said
that
the
courts
should
make
the
decision
as
to
how
that
would
be
handled
based
on...
on
all
the...
the
normal
considerations
that
a
court
looks
at
in
making
those
decisions.
so
that
the
congress
has
had
many
opportunities
to
rule
on
duress.
the
congress...
just
like
the
congress
has
said
you
have
to
have
notice
of
alibi
and
just
like
they
passed
the...
this...
the
rule
about...
i
mean,
the
statute
about
insanity.
the
congress
could
have...
have
abolished
the
duress
defense.
i
don't
think
they
could
have
constitutionally,
but
they
could
have
passed
a
statute
and
spoken
to
that,
but
they've
chosen
not
to.
and
i
think
what
that
tells
us
is
that
the
congress
is
probably
aware
of
the
common
law
and
have
chosen
not
to
interfere
with
the
development
of
the
common
law
in
this
country.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
if
that
is
a
defense
that
is
recognized
by...
by
the
common
law
or...
or
by
statute,
then
the
government
would
have
to
do
that
if
that
particular
defense--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--well--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--well,
the
government
could
do
that
much
the
way
they
do
like
in
an
entrapment
defense.
in
an
entrapment
defense,
the
government
has
to...
once
there's
entrapment
shown,
the
government
has
to
disprove
the
predisposition
of
the
defendant
or
prove
the
defendant
has
predisposition.
and
so--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--justice
ginsburg,
it
does
but
it
still...
that
case
still
deals
with
somebody
overriding
the
will
of
the
defendant,
the
government
imposing
its
own
will
on
the
defendant.
in
that
regard--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--well,
we...
we
contend
that
it's
still
the
same
because
it's
a
third
party,
whether
it's
the
government
or
somebody
else,
who's
overbearing
the
will
of
the
accused.
and
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question,
a
quick
count,
it
looked
like
that
there
were
perhaps
three
that
we
could
count,
but
it
was
a
quick
count.
we
can't
tell
whether
all
those
decisions
were
based
on
state
statutes
or
not.
the
gun
control
statute
was
passed
in
1968,
and
at
the
time,
the
model
penal
code
had
been
passed
in
1962,
and
the
eighth
circuit
had
said
that
the
law
was
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
defendant
does
not
have
the
burden
of
proving
his
duress
defense.
so
we
believe
that
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
that
the
clear
common...
the
clear
law
in
the
country
was
that
the
burden
was
on
the
government
to
disprove
duress.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
the
statute.
by
statute.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
now,
the
government
talks
about
that
the
defendant
can
manufacture
a
defense,
but
you
can
do
that
in
any
case.
you
can
manufacture
a
defense
for
a...
for
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
as
to...
as
to
why
you're
not
guilty.
so
it
really
doesn't
make
a
difference.
it
would
be
the
same
thing
for
self
defense.
in
this
particular
case,
instead
of
ms.
dixon
having
bought
the
guns,
if
she
had
gotten
a
hold
of
one
of
mr.
wright's
guns
and
shot
him,
she
would
have
had
a
self
defense,
and
if
she
had
done
that,
then
the
burden
of
proof
would
have
been
on
the
government
to
disprove
self
defense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
because
she
did
the
less
blameworthy
thing,
that
is,
that
she
bought
guns
instead
of
shooting
somebody
or
killing
somebody,
she
is
disadvantaged
in...
in
the
courtroom.
because...
because
she
raised
duress,
she
then
had
to
prove
her
defense
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
it's
simply
not--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--i
think
rather
than...
than
to
kill
somebody
it
certainly
would
be.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
well,
justice
scalia,
i
understand
the
sentiment,
but
she
was...
she
was
threatened
by
somebody
with...
with
a
gun
and
her
children
were
threatened.
and
she
might
have
killed
him.
she
might
have
shot
him.
in
either
case,
though,
she
is
disadvantaged
by
the
law.
she
would
have
been
better
off
if
she
had
shot
him
or
killed
him,
and
it's
simply
not
consistent
that
she
does
a
less
blameworthy
action,
buying
guns
where
nobody
dies,
her
children
didn't
die,
there
were
no
funerals
for
her,
no
funerals
for
her
children,
no
funerals
for
the
abuser,
nobody
dies,
but
she's
disadvantaged
because
she
doesn't--
mr.
j.
craig
jett
--this
was
a
long
term
relationship.
but
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
is
the
level
of
violence
escalated
substantially
immediately
before
the
gun
shows.
the
violence
had
been
bruising
where
you
couldn't
see
it.
suddenly
it...
it
escalated
with
a
gun
in
the
face
and
a
split
lip
and
a
sudden
threat
to
the
children
that
we're
going...
if
i
kill
you,
i'm
going
to
have
to
kill
your
children.
so
even...
even
though
it
had
gone
on
for
a
while,
it
suddenly
changed,
and
her
state
of
mind
suddenly
changed
because
what
was
most
important
to
her
was
the
safety
of
her
children.
and
so
she
did
what
she
thought
she
had
to
do
in
order
to
save
her
children
and
keep
them
safe.
and
it
simply
would
not
be
fair
that
if
she
had
done
the
less
blameworthy
action,
that
she
has...
is
more
advantaged
in
court.
so
you
can't
square
the
way
duress
is
treated
and
the
way
self
defense
is
treated.
mr.
j.
craig
jett
the
judge
could
do
that
if
he
felt
that
that
was...
was
appropriate
for
one
of
the
elements.
the...
one
of
the
elements
is
you
didn't
have
an...
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
not
do
the
crime.
in
her
mind,
she
did
not
believe
she
did
because
she
believed
that
there
was
somebody
at
home
with
a
gun
threatening
her
children.
and
i'm
out
of
time.
thank
you.
