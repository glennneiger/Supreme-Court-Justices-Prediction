chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
dixon
v.
united
states.
mr.
jett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
martin
against
ohio?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
may
be...
there
may
be
crimes
where
duress
would
vitiate
an
intent
element,
but
there
may
be
other
crimes
where
it
wouldn't.
and...
and
i
don't
understand
your
argument
to
be...
is
it
that
in
every
case
duress
negates
an
element
of
a
crime
or
only
in
some
cases?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
counsel,
under
your
view,
how...
how
is
the
government
supposed
to
prove
a
negative
in
every
case?
how
are
they
supposed
to
prove
the
absence
of
duress?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
something
that...
but
self
defense
is
something
that's
often
a...
a
factual
element
that
you
can
discern
from
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
the...
the
other
guy
had
a
gun,
you
know,
that
sort
of
thing.
so
if
it's
going
to
be
presented...
so
it's
something
that's
within
the
control
of
either
side.
duress
is
something
that
in
this
case
the
government
would
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
even
implicated
until
it's
raised,
and
then
they
have
no
way
of
getting
at
what
the
particulars
are
because
they're
always
in
the
control
of
the
defendant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought
the
gist
of
her
duress
defense
was
not
that
she
was
under
duress
when
she
was
purchasing
the
guns,
but
that
she
had
reason
to
believe
that
her
children
were
being
threatened
by
accomplices
or
associates
of...
of
this...
this
individual.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
facts
of
the...
the
scene
that
would
lead
the
government
to
have
any
access
to
that
evidence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
a
defense
that
i
was
on
drugs
and...
and
didn't
know
what
i
was
doing
because
of
that
and
couldn't
form
the
requisite
intent?
does
the
government
have
to
disprove
that
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
the
government...
how
would
the
government
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
person
just
says,
i
was...
i
was
on,
you
know,
pcp
or
whatever
and...
and
i
couldn't
form
the
requisite
intent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gornstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
may
be
cases
where
the
nature
of
the
mens
rea
required
would
require
the
government
to
disprove
duress.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
sort
of
crimes
where...
where
your
culpability
depends
on
your
motive.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
be
an
easy
example.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
a...
you
know,
a
hate
crime,
a
bias
crime,
you
know,
an
act
of
violence
done
with
a
particular
motive
or
intent?
and
the...
and
the
suggestion
is
i
didn't
do
this
because
of
a
particular
motive.
i
did
this
because
they
had
a
gun
to
the
head
of
my
children.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
get
there,
what...
roughly
speaking,
how
much
of
the
model
penal
code
has
congress
enacted
into
the
criminal--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--some
judges
too.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
was
this...
the
underlying
statute
at
issue
here
enacted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
jett,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
jett.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
in
05-7053,
dixon
versus
united
states.
