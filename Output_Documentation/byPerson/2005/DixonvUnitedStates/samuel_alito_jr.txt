well,
what
is
the
statutory...
what
is
the
mens
rea
under
the
statute
for
the
offenses
that
the
defendant
was
charged
with?
it's
knowingly,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the...
the
methodology
that
you
think
we
should
follow
in
determining
where
the
burden
should
be
allocated
under
any
particular
criminal
statute?
is
it
the...
the
majority
rule
at
the
time
when
that
particular
statute
was
enacted
or
at...
is
it...
you
don't
think
it's
the...
the
old
common
law
rule.
what...
what
is
the...
at
what
point
of
time
do
we
look
at
the...
at
what's
going
on
throughout
our
country?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
burden
would
be
different
under
different
statutes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
were
dealing
with
a...
with
a
much
older
criminal
statute,
the
burden
might
be
allocated
differently?
