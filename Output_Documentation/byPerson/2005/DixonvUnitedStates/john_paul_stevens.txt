justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
if...
if
you
know,
whether
congress
has
ever
been
asked
to
address
this
precise
issue
that
we're
debating
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
self
defense
fit
into
this
equation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
the
number
of
decisions...
number
of
states
have
gone
one
way
or...
or
the
other
on
the
issue
relevant?
it's
not
an
eighth
amendment
question,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
not?
isn't
it
realistic
to
assume
that
congress
looked
at
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
it's
passing
a
statute
and
presumably
adopted
what
was
the
prevailing
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
a
consensus
view.
it
could
still
be
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute
is
what
would
be
relevant,
i
would
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gornstein,
there
are
some
old
cases
that
draw
a
distinction
between
justifications
and
excuses.
you
carefully
use
the
words
excuse
to
describe
that
defense.
did
you
do
so
having
in
mind
that
distinction
or
just
as
a
loose
description
of
the...
of
the
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
made
some
purchases
of
firearms
at
a
gun
show
and
violated
two
criminal
statutes
when
she
did
so.
she
was
receiving
a
firearm
when
under
indictment,
and
she
made
false
statements
in
connection
with
the
purchases.
at
trial,
she
did
not
deny
committing
the
offenses
or
any
of
the
elements
of
the
offenses,
but
rather
she
pleaded
the
affirmative
defense
of
duress,
testifying
that
she
had
a
boyfriend
who
had
seriously
threatened
or
threatened
serious
harms
to
herself
and
to
her
two
daughters.
the
issue
that
the
case
turns
on
is
whether
--
on
the
issue
of
duress,
she
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
defense
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
or,
as
she
contends,
it
was
the
government’s
burden
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
she
did
not
act
under
duress.
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
we
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
agree
with
the
government’s
view
that
she
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
affirmative
defense.
