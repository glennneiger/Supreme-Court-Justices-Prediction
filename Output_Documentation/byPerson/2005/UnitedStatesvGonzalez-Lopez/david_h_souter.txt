justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
issue
in
that
case
is
competent
performance,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
the
difficulty
behind
a
number
of
our
questions
this
morning
is
that
you
are
trying
to
draw
an
analogy
from...
from
counsel
issues
that
don't
involve
an
autonomy
interest
to
a
counsel
issue
that
does
involve
an
autonomy
interest,
maybe
in
theory
not
as
greatly
as
self
representation,
but
as...
as
everybody
agrees,
as
you've
said,
it
involves
some
autonomy
interest.
and
if
we're
going
to
import
the
rule
of
prejudice
from
non
autonomy
cases
as
the...
as
the
necessary
condition
in
autonomy
cases,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
autonomy
interest
is
devalued
to
the
point
of
almost
of
disappearance.
it
becomes
not
much
more
than...
a
little
bit,
but
not
much
more
than
an
ineffective
assistance
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
say
he's...
he's
not
denied
all
choice.
he
is
denied
the
choice
that
he
wants
to
make.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
the
state's
problem.
we're
talking
about
the
state
standing
in
the
way
of
it.
in
this
case
the
state
through
the
court
system
stood
in
the
way
of
it
because
it
made
an
error
that
denied
him
his
right.
but
the...
the...
it
seems
to
me
the
autonomy
interest
is
not
merely
an
interest
in
choosing
second
best.
it's
an
interest
in
choosing
the
one
you
want.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
second
best
to
the
guy
who
wants
somebody
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
good
is
that
as...
as
an
answer
to
our
question?
sure,
no
harm,
no
foul.
but
that
can't
be
the...
that
can't
be
the
criterion
for
a
court
and
that
can't
be
our
criterion
in
deciding
whether
he
really
has
a
right
to
his
first
choice
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's...
it's
basically...
in...
in
justice
scalia's
question,
it
is
connected
with
what
the...
the
client
believes
will
be
a
favorable
outcome
by
using
the
lawyer
he
wants.
it's
his
judgment
about
what
will
probably
be
a
favorable
outcome,
and
his
judgment
about
the
lawyer
who
is
most
likely
to
bring
that
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
all...
all
i'm
getting
it,
is
that's
a
different...
that
is
a
very
different
criterion
from
what
we
apply
in
strickland.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
take
it
away
from
the
10
percent?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're...
because
you're
saying
they
don't
have
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
there
a
less
worthy
historical
tradition
to
be
honored
in
a
defendant's
choice
of
his
own
counsel?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you
concede
that
if...
if
it's
a
historical
tradition
to
speak
in
one's
own
voice,
it
gets...
for
practical
purposes,
it
gets
a
kind
of
absolute
respect.
whereas,
if
it's
a
historical
tradition
to
choose
one's
own
counsel,
it
does
not
get
that...
i
mean,
it's
very...
that
seems
to
me
a...
a
kind
of
historical
dissonance.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
the
question
is
he...
i
mean,
the...
the
whole
point
here
isn't
the...
isn't
the
interest
in
autonomy
a
separate
interest
which
should
be
recognized
by
some
means
other
than
merely
looking
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
isn't
the
sacrifice
sort
of
egregious
here?
because
in
the
case
of
self
representation,
we
give
virtually
absolute
respect
to
it,
knowing
perfectly
well
that
the
decision
to
represent
one's
self
is
usually
crazy.
whereas,
in
this
case,
when
the
decision
may
very
well
be
sound,
we
give...
we
would,
on
your
view,
give
a...
a
much
reduced
respect
to
it.
that
does
not
seem
consistent.
