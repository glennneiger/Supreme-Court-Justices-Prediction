how
do
you
reconcile
your
position
with
the
right
to
self
representation,
if
somebody
doesn't
want
a
lawyer
at
all?
and
i
guess
if
he
insists
on
not
taking
a
lawyer,
that
could
be
reversible
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
even
a
greater
right
than
the
right
to
pick
your
own
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
the
choice
of
counsel
protect
autonomy
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
a
lawyer.
after
30
years,
you
trust
him
completely.
you
want
him
to
represent
you.
isn't
that
a...
an
element
of
autonomy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
almost
essential,
in
one
of
these
inquiries,
to...
to
invade
the
attorney
client
privilege
over
and
over
again
to
find
out
what
they
might
have
done
with
a
different
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
dreeben,
i
think
you're
underestimating
the
importance
of
the
autonomy
interest
because
going
through
a
criminal
trial
for
a
defendant
is
a
very
traumatic
experience,
not
just
what
happens
in
the
courtroom,
but
during
the
entire
process.
he
has
a
lawyer
of
his
own
choice
who's
going
to
advise
him
on
what
he
should
do
and
how
he
should
react
to
possible
changes
in
his
own
condition
and
everything
else.
the...
the
autonomy
interest
is
powerful
in
that
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
totally
independently
of
the
trial
strategy--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
dreeben,
do
you
agree
with
his
characterization
that
all
the
courts
of
appeals
go
the
other
way?
