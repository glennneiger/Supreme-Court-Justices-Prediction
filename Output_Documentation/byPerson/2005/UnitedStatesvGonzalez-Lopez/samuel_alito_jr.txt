justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
would
it
be
easier
than
in
strickland?
in
the...
in
the
case
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
you
have
a
very
focused
inquiry,
but
in
this
situation,
how
are
you
going
to...
how
can
a
judge
assess,
after
the
fact,
whether
the
strategy
that
was
pursued
was
inferior
to
another
strategy
that's...
that...
that
allegedly
would
have
been
pursued
if
the
first
choice
attorney
had
been
selected?
or
maybe
even
more
difficult,
how
can
a
judge
assess
whether
the
attorney
who
ended
up
representing
the
defendant
was
in
some
way
less
skillful
than
the
attorney
that
the...
the
defendant
preferred
to
have?
that
seems
like
a
very
difficult
determination
to
make.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
can
there
not
be
a
case
where
it's
clear
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the...
the
judge's
mistaken
ruling
on
a
disqualification
motion
didn't
have
any
effect
on
the
outcome?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
say
the
defendant
wanted
to
be
represented
by
a
relative
whose...
whose
specialty
is
real
estate,
and
for
some
reason,
that
lawyer
is
wrongfully
disqualified.
and
so
then
the
defendant
ends
up
with
a
very
experienced
criminal
practitioner
with
a
national
representation...
a
national
reputation,
and
still
the
defendant
is
convicted.
could
that
not
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
your...
would
your
rule--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--would
your
rule
apply
in
the
case
of
a
guilty
plea?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
your
comment
about
the
defendant
running
out
of
a
funds
is...
raises
a
good
point.
so
the
remedy
would
be
an
automatic
reversal
in
a
case
like
that
where
the
defendant
would
be
represented
by
appointed
counsel?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
this
case.
