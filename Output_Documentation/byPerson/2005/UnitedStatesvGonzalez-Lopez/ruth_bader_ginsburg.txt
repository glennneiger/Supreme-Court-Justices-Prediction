but
in
this...
in
this
case,
mr.
dreeben,
we
have
a
defendant
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
pay
for
an
experienced
lawyer
in
whom
he
has
great
trust.
he's
instead
stuck
with
a
younger,
rather
inexperienced
lawyer,
and
he
says,
that
doesn't
fit
within
my
sixth
amendment
right.
i
have
a
right
to
choose
the
counsel
that
i
want
and
not
the
one
that
the
court
forces
on
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
a
junior
counsel.
as
i
understand
it,
the
counsel
that
represented
him
finally,
when
the
judge
wrongfully
refused
to
allow
his
chosen
counsel
to
proceed,
was
one
chosen
as
a
junior
by
the
more
senior
counsel,
the
one
that
defendant
wanted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i,
mr.
dreeben--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
compared
to
what?
you
haven't
fully
stated
what
you
would
replace
the
automatic
new
trial
with.
and
you
said...
you
started
to
say
something
about
if
the
defendant
could
show
that
his
preferred
counsel
would
have
pursued
a
different
strategy.
is
that
it?
or
would
he
have
to
go
beyond
that
and
show
that
that
different
strategy
would
have
a
greater
chance
of
success
than
the
strategy
that
was
in
fact
pursued?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
different
outcome
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
the
defendant
is
found
guilty,
he
would
have
been
acquitted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
you
had...
you
said
you
had...
your
first
preference
would
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--different
strategy
and
would
have
been
acquitted
with
that
strategy.
what's
your
other--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
this...
trial
is...
is
one
thing.
appeal...
but
you
say
he
would
do
the
appeal
over?
he'd
do
the
appellate
argument
over?
do
the
petition
for
cert
over
with
counsel
of
choice?
there's
a
different
stage
involved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you...
are
you
relying
at
all
on
the
effect
that
you
want
the
court's
decision
to
have
on
trial
judges
and
prosecutors,
that
is,
a
judge
who
knows
if
he
disqualifies
a
lawyer
who
shouldn't
be
disqualified,
that
there
will
be
an
automatic
new
trial?
and
the
prosecutor
who's
standing
by...
by
the
way,
what
did
the
prosecutor...
did
the
prosecutor
take
the
position
in
this
case
when
the
judge
says,
i
don't
want
that
lawyer
to
be
in
my
courtroom?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fisher,
remind
me
in
bringing
up
the
plea
question.
i
thought
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
defendant
wanted
this
particular
lawyer
is
that
this
lawyer
made
good
bargains
with
the
prosecutor.
was
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
they
said
there
isn't
if
the
question
is
remedied.
