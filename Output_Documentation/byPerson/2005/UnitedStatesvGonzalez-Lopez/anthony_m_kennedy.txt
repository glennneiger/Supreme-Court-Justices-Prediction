justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
was
my...
even
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
i...
i
take
it
the
client
has
a
right
to
direct
the
attorney
what
defense
to
present,
or
am
i
wrong
about
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
the
government's
position
be
if
the
disappointed
client
whose
choice
of
counsel
was
rejected
by
the
court
applied
for
mandate
review
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
don't
know...
we
don't
know
if
that's
the
case.
he...
he
wants
to
go
immediately
to
the
court
of
appeals.
what
would
the
government's
position
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
government
always
acquiesces
in
the
propriety
of
seeking
mandate
from
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
i
suppose
the
government
can
object
that
it's
improper
or
that
it's
unnecessary
or
a
waste
of
time.
i'm
asking
what
the
government's
position
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if...
if
the
question
is
fairness,
as
you...
as
you
propose,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
extraordinary
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
say
that
presumption
is
sufficient
so
that
mandate
should
be
entertained
by
a
court
of
appeals
anytime
this
question
comes
up?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in...
in
hindsight,
you've
always
made
a
mistake
if
your
client
is
found
guilty.
i...
i'm
just
not
sure
how
this
inquiry
would
proceed.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
ought
to
be
either
automatic
reversal
on
one...
on
one
hand,
or
the
other
rule
ought
to
be
incompetency
of
counsel.
but
you're...
you're
going
to
have
satellite
litigation
with
speculation,
and
it
seems...
it
seems
to
me
not
a
good
remedy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
just
disqualify.
suppose
he
denies
a
motion
for
continuance.
the
counsel
is
in
another
trial
and
he
said,
i
can't
be
here
for
another
10
days.
and
the
court
says,
i...
i
deny
that.
i...
i
assume
if
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion,
the
result
would
be
the
same
under
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
may
leave
the
jurisprudence
where
you
found
it,
but
other
attorneys
might
not.
and
i'm...
i'm
concerned
with
the
consequences
of
your
rule.
there
are
many
reasons,
it
seems
to
me,
why
a
counsel
may
not
be
able
to
represent
the...
the
client
that
has
chosen
him
as...
as
the
first
choice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if...
if
you
prevail
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
counsel
can
come
in
and
say,
now,
judge,
look
at
your
calendar,
and
you
can
certainly
wait
for
another
2
weeks,
and
the
judge
has
to
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
know
why
he
wouldn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
would
happen
if
there's
an
autonomous,
structural
right
of
the
kind
you...
you
urge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i
want
to
control
the
case
by
having
a
different
appointed
counsel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
this
is
all
subject
challenge
as
an
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
cases
in
the
records
where
it
shows
government
overreaching
or
bad
faith
and
so
forth
in
trying
to
get
rid
of
a
counsel?
that
just
doesn't
happen?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the...
what
are
the
practicalities
or
impracticalities,
as
the
case
may
be,
of
seeking
immediate
review
from
the
court
of
appeals
just
by
writ
of
mandate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it
would
be
easy
for
us
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
right
and
the
remedy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in
all
events,
we
could
structure
the
decision
to
make...
to
make
sense,
and
if
these
instances
happen,
as
you
indicate
in
your
brief,
very
rarely,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
is
mandate
in
a
court
of
appeals.
