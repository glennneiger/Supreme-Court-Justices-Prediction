chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
in
united
states
v.
gonzalez
lopez.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
what
if...
just
to
take
an
example,
let's
suppose
there
are
two
possible
defenses
you
could
raise,
entrapment
and
that
you
didn't
do
it.
and
one
lawyer
wants
to
argue
entrapment
and
the
other
wants
to,
you
know...
the
one
that
you
want
is
the
one
who
said
we'll
argue
you
didn't
do
it.
don't
you
have
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer
present
the
defense
along
the
lines
you
want
presented
as
opposed
to
having
to
take
another
lawyer
that
is
different
than
your
choice?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben,
did
i
understand
your
brief
to
suggest
that
the...
i
understand
your
main
burden
is
to
overturn
the
idea
of
automatic
reversal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
there
were
a
standard,
is
your
standard
of
prejudice
the
same
as
under
strickland,
or
is
it
a
different
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
right
of
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
for
the
fuller
expression
of
his
autonomy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
require...
if...
if
a
defendant
is
on
his
second
choice
and
he's
filed
an
affidavit
saying,
you
know,
the
guy
did
a
great
job.
i
can't
think
of
a
way
he
would
have
done
anything
differently.
i
was
convicted.
i'm
perfectly
happy
with
his
strategy,
but
i
didn't
get
my
first
choice.
you
would
still
require
reversal
of
the
conviction
in
that
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and...
and
if...
if
he
were
not
able
to
afford
a...
afford
an
attorney
and
one
were
appointed
for
him
and
that
lawyer
were
incompetent,
that
client
would
still
have
to
show
prejudice.
but
in
your
case,
you
don't
have
to
show
anything
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
a...
someone
relying
on
appointed
counsel
have
the
same
right?
why
can't
he
say
to
the
first
person
who
comes
through
the
door,
you
know,
i've
got
a...
i'd
like
to
see
the
others
before
i
make
a
choice?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
many
lawyers...
you're
talking
about
a
very
refined
assertion
of
a
constitutional
right.
i
mean
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lawyers,
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
you
don't
get
choice
one,
choice
two
is
just
not
going
to
do,
no
matter
how
close,
no
matter
how
similar
their
approaches
are
going
to
be.
it's
not
like
he's,
you
know,
wants
a
rolls
royce
and
he
gets
a...
you
know,
whatever...
a
yugo
or
something.
he
could
choose,
you
know,
the
next
best
out
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
thousands.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
not
in
the
case
of
an
acquittal?
there's
still
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
maybe
you
don't
have
an
appeal,
but
you
have
a
1983
action.
right?
because
your
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
because,
although
you
won,
you
didn't
win
with
the
counsel
of
your
choice.
and
if...
your
personal
autonomy
interests
have
been
quashed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
wouldn't
be
harmless
under
your
theory
because
your
theory
is
that
this
has
given
expression
to
your
personal
autonomy.
it's
not
simply
for
your
defense.
if
it
were
harmless,
it
would
say
that
it's
totally
wrapped
up
in
the
defense.
but
there's
another
constitutional
interest
under
your
theory.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
suppose
this...
this
right
applies
on
appeal
as
well.
right?
somebody
says,
i
want
mr.
fisher
to
argue
my
case
in
the
supreme
court.
i
don't
want
anybody
else.
and...
and
yet...
and
we
get
motions
for
admission
to
our
bar
pro
hac
vice.
if
we
deny
one
of
those,
does
that
violate
the
sixth
amendment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that...
that
happens
all
the
time.
that
happens,
for
example,
in
the
case
of
incompetent
counsel.
there's
a
right
to...
to
competent
counsel.
if
you...
if
that
right
is
violated,
the
defendant
still
has
to
show
prejudice--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--before
he'll
get
relief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
some
of
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--some
of
the
concerns
about
the
evidentiary
presentation
were
addressed
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
reason
they
adopted
a...
a
lesser
standard
than
the
prejudice
standard
in...
in
strickland.
why
isn't
that
adequate
to
meet
those
concerns?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
then
you
wouldn't...
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
but
at
that
point,
the
defendant
would
be
well
advised
to
go
ahead
with
trial
with
his
second
choice
lawyer.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
take
his
chance
and
then
if
he...
if
he
loses,
he
gets
automatic
reversal.
so
why
would
he
do
mandamus?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
government,
you're
including
the
court
in
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
always
true
in
a
strickland
case.
it's
often
the
court
that's
making
the
mistakes
that
the
lawyer
should
have
objected
to
and
was
incompetent
in
not
doing
so.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
in
05-352,
united
states
versus
gonzalez-lopez.
