mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
moment
a
trial
court
impermissibly
disqualifies
a
defendant's
retained
counsel
of
choice,
it
violates
the
sixth
amendment.
it
is
not
necessary
to
wait
and
see
what
happens
at
any
trial
that
follows,
and
indeed,
in
our
view--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
this
court
already
has
a
body
of
jurisprudence,
beginning
with
powell
against
alabama,
that
decides
when
a
judge
acts
within
his
discretion
in
denying
a
continuance,
for
example,
to
allow
the
defendant
to
get
the
retained
counsel
of
his
choice.
we'll...
we'll
leave
that
jurisprudence
where
we
found
it
when
we
showed
up
today
because
here,
it's
undisputed
in
the
record,
and
the...
and
the
united
states
does
not
dispute
in
this
court,
that
the
denial
was
impermissible--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--we
don't...
we
don't--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--we
don't
think
that's
the
case,
justice
kennedy.
in
this
court's
jurisprudence,
you've
already
recognized
that
trial
judges
have
substantial
discretion,
both
in
terms
of
calendaring
and
efficiency
concerns,
and
in
the
wheat
case,
for
things
like
conflicts
in
interest
to
regulate
when
the
defendant
is
able
to
proceed
with
the
defendant...
i'm
sorry...
with
the
lawyer
he's
chosen.
as
i
said,
we're
not
asking
to
change
the
status
quo
in
any
respect
here
because
here
it's
undisputed
that
the
trial
judge
had
no
legitimate
reason
to
deny
the
defendant--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
it
seems...
you
know,
perhaps
we
could
imagine
a
scenario,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
the
defendant
effectively
waives
his
right,
and
if
he
came
out
and
said
so
much
to
the
court.
but
certainly
it
is
our
position
that
if
he's
denied
the
first
choice
counsel
against
his
wishes
and
without
any
legitimate
justification,
a
sixth
amendment
violation
occurs
right
then
and
there.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
and
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
kind
of
right
that
we're
talking
about
today,
and
this
is
the
critical
difference
between
the
counsel
of
choice
right
and
the
strickland
right.
and
the
difference
is
in...
in
the
counsel
of
choice
right,
the
government
has
affirmatively
acted
to
interfere
with
the
way
the
defendant
wants
to
conduct
his
defense
and
has
every
right
to
conduct
his
defense--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
he
doesn't,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
defendant
who
has
counsel
of
his...
who's...
who's
appointed
counsel
does
have
a
limited
right
to
control
certain
fundamental
decisions
in
his
defense
such
as
whether
he
testifies,
whether
he
accepts
a
plea
offer.
so
there
is
even
some
autonomy
that
resides
in
the
defendant
who
has
appointed
counsel.
but
the
critical
distinction--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--certainly
that
happens,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
you
know,
there
are...
there
are
certain
instances
where
a
defendant
may
be
so...
have
so
little
basis
for
doing
so
or
may
be...
you
know,
may
be
asking
too
much
of
the
court--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the...
the
autonomy
interest
in
this
case
is
the
defendant's
right
to
control
his
defense.
it's
the
defendant's
right,
as
this
court
put
it
in
faretta
and
later
in
mckaskle,
to
control
the
way
his
case--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
this
court...
i
mean,
in
numerous
areas
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
not
just
in
criminal
procedure,
this
court
recognizes
that
there...
people
have
certain
rights,
but
if
they
have
the
means
to
effectuate
those
rights,
they're
in
a
better
position
than
people
that
don't.
take
the
first
amendment.
the
first
amendment
protects
people
with
printing
presses,
but
the
government
doesn't
have
to
go
around
giving
other
people
printing
presses
in
order
to...
to
say
what
they
want
to
say.
so
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
10
percent,
or
whatever
number
we
want
to
ascribe
to
it,
of
defendants
who
have
the...
the
ability
and
the
means
to
hire
retained
counsel.
and
at
the
moment
a
trial
court
tells
them,
for
no
legitimate
reason,
you
cannot
go
forward
with
this
person,
that's
what
we
submit
constitutes
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
and
in--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--in
some
cases,
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
although
i
would
hasten
to...
to
tell
you
that
even
in
the
context
of
defendants
who
can
retain
counsel,
very
often,
if
their
retained
counsel
is
disqualified,
they're
forced,
as
in
this
case...
they're
simply
out
of
money
and
have
to
go
forward
with
local
counsel.
so
as
practical
terms,
i'm
not
quite
sure
that's
right.
but,
yes,
we
are
talking
about
a
small
universe
of
people,
but
it's
an
important
universe
of
people.
it's
people
that
come
into
court
and
they
say
this
is
how
i
want
to
conduct
my
defense.
in
mckaskle,
talking
about
the
self
representation
right,
this
court
said
that
oftentimes
the
messenger
is
as
important
as
the
message
in...
in
a
criminal
defendant's
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
only
in
the
case
of
an
acquittal.
and...
and
there...
and
there,
of
course,
we
don't
have
an
appeal.
but,
justice
alito,
i
think
this
goes
back--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--to
the
twinkie--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
you'd
have
a
constitutional
violation,
but
it
would,
in
fact,
be
harmless,
and
i
don't
think
you'd
have
a
1983
action
because--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--okay.
well,
i...
i
think
what
i'll
say
is
then
we
have
an
immunity
problem
with
bringing
the
1983
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
let
me
say
two
things
to
that,
justice
alito.
the
first
is
that's
akin
to
the
hypotheticals
in
the
united
states'
brief.
we've...
we're
not
aware
of
that
situation
ever
having
occurred.
but
if
it
did,
yes,
you
would
have
a
violation.
and
it's
important
to
separate
the
right
from
the
remedy
here.
we
would
unquestionably
have
a
sixth
amendment
violation
when
the
trial
court,
for
no
legitimate
reason,
said,
you
cannot
go
forward
with
the
counsel
of
choice.
now,
the
only
question
i
think
you're
framing
is
whether
we
have
a
chapman
case
there.
but
this
just
brings
up,
justice
scalia's
twinkie
case,
and
to
take
away--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i'll
try
to
do
even
better
than
uncle
vinnie,
and
say
in
our
brief
we
talk
about
a
case,
the
euel
lee
case,
which
is
a
case
where
a
black
defendant
wanted
to
go
forward
with
his
counsel
of
choice
in...
in
the
district
of
maryland,
and
he
was
forced
to
go
ahead
with
a
more
experienced,
establishment
type
counsel
and...
and
to
his
detriment.
so...
so
we
proceed
at
our
peril
where
we
say
that
the
defendant
doesn't
have
the
right
to
decide
what's
best
for
him.
the
core
right,
which
this
court
recognized
in
wheat...
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
this
court
saying
in
wheat
there's
a
presumption
that
the
defendants
have
the
right
to
proceed
with
counsel
of
choice
really
can't
be
explained
in
any
other
way
than
saying
that
the
right...
the
sixth
amendment
right
here
goes
beyond
simply
a
fair
trial
and
does
encompass
an
autonomy
interest.
and
to
conceptualize
that
autonomy
interest
within
the
sixth
amendment
the
way
that
wheat
does
is
simply
to
say
that
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
is
like
any
number
of
other
sixth
amendment
rights,
which
is
to
say,
trial
judges
have
the
power
to
curtail
it
or
qualify
it
when
they
have
legitimate
reasons
for
things
like
the
integrity
of
the
courts,
for
things
like
the
efficiency
of
the
docket,
justice
kennedy,
and
lots
of
other
things.
the
same
is
true
of
self
representation.
a
defendant
does
not
have
an
unqualified
right
to
self
representation.
a
defendant
can
be
forced
to
have
standby
counsel.
the
defendant
can
even
have
his
right
to
self
representation
taken
away
if
he's
too...
too
disruptive
in
the
courtroom.
so
the
same
kinds
of
concerns--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
and
there
is...
the
united
states
raises
in
its
brief
the...
the
supposed
danger
that
courts
and
prosecutors
will
be
too
hesitant
to
challenge
selected
counsel
of
choice,
but
you've
already
taken
that
fully
in
consideration
in
your
wheat
decision.
i
mean,
that's
the
basis
for
this
wheat
decision
is
to
say
these
are
decisions
that
have
to
be
made
at
the
outset
of
trial.
and
so,
therefore,
we're
going
to
give
trial
judges
substantial
latitude
and
broad
discretion
to
decide
when...
when
the
defendant
has
to
accept
a
different
lawyer.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
it's
not
contested
in
this
case
that
the...
that
the
pro
hac
vice
denial
did
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
so
i'm
not
sure...
this
isn't
something
you
have
to
deal
with
in
this
case.
but,
yes,
this
would
be
a
right
that
would...
that
would
go
forward
on
appeal,
provided
the
defendant
walked
into
court
and
said
this
is
the
person
who
i
want
to
go
forward
with
me,
and
the
court,
under
its
rules
and
practices
and
in
the
substantial
discretion
that
court
has
in
wheat,
if
the
trial
court
simply
went...
if
the
court
simply
went
off
the
reservation
and
said,
no,
you
can't
have
this
person
for
no
reason,
there
would
be.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
might
be,
justice
ginsburg.
and
to
be
frank
with
you,
i
haven't
thought
all
the
way
through
the
consequences--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
you're
not.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
so
there
is
a
difference,
of
course,
this
court
has
recognized
in
its
martinez
case,
that
takes
place.
but
to
bring
the
point
home,
in...
in
wheat,
simply
saying
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
unless
the
trial
court
has
a
good
reason
for
saying
no,
would
make
this
right
just
like
lots
of
other
rights
in
the
sixth
amendment,
the
right
to
self
representation,
the
right
to
cross
examination,
all
the
other
rights
in
the
sixth
amendment
that
can
give
way
for
efficiency
or
integrity
concerns.
but
what
the
united
states
is
suggesting
is
something
radically
different
that
we
submit
doesn't
exist
anywhere
else
in
constitutional
law,
which
is
to
say
that
this
court
recognizes
that
a
certain
right
exists,
but
when
it's
arbitrarily
denied,
the
defendant
simply
has
no
remedy
unless
he
can
affirmatively
show
his
own
prejudice.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
critical
difference
between
this
and
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
is
the
affirmative
action
by
the
court.
and
in
strickland
itself
at
page
686,
this
court
recognized
the
geders...
the
geders
decision,
the
brooks
decision,
the
herring
decision,
which
are
all
accepted
by
the
solicitor
general
in
footnote
3
of
its
brief.
and
the
core
holding
of
those
cases
is
when
the
court
interferes
with
what
the
defendant
wants
to
do,
then
a
sixth
amendment
violation
takes
place
right
then
and
there,
and
we
don't
look
at
all
to
whether
prejudice
took
place.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
let
me
answer
it
both
on
the
facts
and
on
the
law.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
was
a
pretrial
sanction
hearing
in
which
the
prosecutor
showed
up
unannounced
to
the
defense
and
actually
submitted
witnesses
and
evidence
to
support
the
disqualification
of
mr.
low.
so,
yes,
the
prosecutor
did
play
a
part
and
support
the
disqualification
in
this
case.
now,
to
answer
your
question
on
the
law
and
the
practicalities,
we're
here
today
defending
the
status
quo
because
the
rule
in
every
federal
circuit
is
that
on
direct
appeal
if
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
is
denied,
it's
an
automatic
reversal.
so
we're...
we're
relying
on
the
practicalities
of
how
things
work
in
the
lower
courts
only
to
the
extent
to
say
it's
working
fine
just
now,
and
this
court
ought
not
to
upset
that.
right
now,
by
our
count,
you
get
probably
fewer
than
one
case
a
year
in
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
where
a
scenario
as
rare
as
this
arises.
and
so
we
think
that
this
court's
incentives,
which
are
put
in
place
by
the
wheat
case,
as
i
was
talking
about,
get
it
just
right.
they
get
it
so
that,
yes,
there's
a
little
bit
of
hesitance,
but
on
the
other
hand,
trial
judges
have
substantial
discretion
in
making
these
threshold
decisions.
and
so
we
submit--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
case,
justice
kennedy,
where
an
express
finding
of
bad
faith
is
placed
on
the
record.
but...
but,
of
course,
that
points
out
one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
about
this
kind
of
case
is
that
we
just
have
a
record
in
many
ways.
what
the
united
states
is
suggesting
is
that
we
should
have
these
satellite
collateral
proceedings
where
we
have
to
not
just
investigate
questions
like
that
perhaps,
but
also
recreate
an
entire
trial.
and
this
is
much
more
difficult
than
the
strickland
scenario
because,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
in
strickland
we
can
at
least
compare
the
defendant...
the
defendant's
lawyer's
performance
against
an
objective...
an
objective
counsel.
and
even...
and
it's
even
easier
than
that
because,
because
of
the
performance
prong,
the
first
prong
of
the
strickland
test,
we
winnow
out
the
decisions
that
lawyer
made
to
probably
just
two
or
three.
i
mean,
in
this
court's
typical
strickland
case,
it
looks
at
one
or
two
decisions
a
trial
judge...
the
trial
counsel
made.
in
this
context,
we'd
have
to
look
not
just
at
an
entire
trial,
but
at
the
entire
attorney
client
relationship
from
the
moment
the...
the
counsel
would
have
met
the
defendant,
all
of
the
different
decisions
that
might
have
taken
place
in
terms
of
investigation,
negotiation,
strategy
before
trial,
strategy
during
trial.
and
what
you'd
be
asking
is
for
this
first
choice
counsel
presumably
to
take
the
stand
or
file
some
sort
of
affidavit
not
saying
this
is
the
strategy
that
would
have...
would
have
necessarily
happened
because
he
didn't
get
to
try
the
case.
what...
what
you'd
be
asking
this
person
to
do
is
sort
of
take
the
stand
and
hypothesize
what
he
might
have
done
in
all
these
various
situations--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--with
all
the
problems
of
hindsight.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
mean,
our
rule
would...
would
apply
in
a
guilty
plea
case,
provided
the
defendant
didn't
waive
it,
didn't
waive
the...
the
argument
of
his
guilty
plea.
but
the
problem
with...
you
know,
to
look
at
the
other
side,
imagine
the...
the
case
where
the
defendant's
first
choice
counsel
is
disqualified
and
he
does
plead
guilty
and
he
wants
to
plead
guilty,
which,
of
course,
happens
in
over
90
percent
of
the
criminal
cases
in
the
country.
there,
we
have
an
enormous
problem
because
how
is
that
person
supposed
to
show
on
appeal
what
would
have
happened
with
his
first
choice
lawyer?
first
of
all,
under
the...
under
the
united
states
conception,
which
conflates
this...
this
right
with
strickland,
they
have
the
problem
of
this
court's
decision
in
hill
against
lockhart
which
holds
that
a
defendant
doesn't
have
an
ineffective
assistance
type
claim
unless
he
can
show
that
he
wouldn't
have
pleaded
guilty
at
all
but
for
his
counsel's
advice.
and
secondly,
we
have
the
problem,
once
again,
of
just
the
crazy
kind
of
predictions
that
we
have
start
to
engage
in.
we...
i
suppose
there
in
a
guilty
plea
case,
we
have
to
put
the...
the
first
choice
lawyer
on
the
stand
to
testify
to
all
the
various
things
he
might
have
done.
then
perhaps
we
have
to
put
the
prosecutor
on
the
stand
to
say,
oh,
would
you
have
taken
the
deal
if
this
would
have
taken
place
and
that
would
have
taken
place
and
the
other
would
have
taken
place.
and...
and
what
we
submit
is
that
not
only
is...
is
this
fundamentally
improper
because
once
we
have
a
constitutional
violation,
the
only...
the
only
choices
on
appeal
are
chapman
error
and
structural
error,
and
all
of
this
is
outside
the
record.
so
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
under
chapman.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that
is
part
of
the
record,
justice
ginsburg.
the
lawyer
that
the
defendant
wanted
in
this
case
had
appeared
in
the
very
same
court
several
months
before
before
the
very
same
judge
and
stepped
in
on
the
eve
of
trial
and
negotiated
an
extremely
favorable
plea
agreement
for
the
defendant
in
that
case.
and
that's
how
mr.
gonzalez
lopez
learned
about
mr.
low
and
that's
why
he
sought
him
out.
i
don't
think
it's
a
part
of
the
record
whether
he
wanted
to
plead
guilty
or
whether
he
wanted
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but
that's
certainly
one
of
his
considerations.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
for
two
reasons,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
the
seventh
circuit,
with
due
respect,
simply
misconceived
the
right.
it's
our
fundamental
submission
here
that
the
right
is
violated
at
the
moment
the
trial
judge
impermissibly
disqualifies
the
counsel,
and
that's
what
the
seventh
circuit
didn't
understand.
once
you
say
that
that
violates
the
right,
then
your
only
choices,
under
this
court's
jurisprudence...
what
it
said
in
neder
was
the
only
two
choices
are
structural
error
or
a
chapman
review.
the
seventh
circuit,
of
course,
was
deciding
a
habeas
case.
it
had
an
evidentiary...
it
had
the
ability
to
compile
an
evidentiary
record,
but
once
you
recognize
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
of
choice
is
violated
at
the
moment
of
the
disqualification,
then
your
only
choices
are
strickland...
i'm
sorry...
are
chapman
or
structural
error.
the
seventh
circuit
way
of
doing
things,
which
the
united
states
to
some
degree
embraces,
of
having
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
collateral
review
proves
the
point
why
we
can't
say
this
is
subject
to
harmless
error
review
because
we
don't
have
the
stuff
in
the
record
that
we
need.
and
that's
what
the
seventh
circuit
didn't...
didn't...
first
of
all,
it
wasn't
speaking
to
it
because,
of
course,
it
was
deciding
a
habeas
case.
but
it--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--oh,
well,
there's...
there's
two
big
problems
with
what
the...
with
the
united
states'
position
on
that
point,
justice
kennedy.
the
first
is,
i...
i
think
as...
as
came
out,
if
mandamus
became
too
common,
it
would
effectively
overrule
this
court's
flanagan
decision.
but
there's
an
even
more
fundamental
problem,
which
is
to
say
that
mandamus
is
only
available
when
a
defendant
can
show
a
clear
violation
of
a
right.
now,
the
way
the
united
states
conceives
the
right,
there's
no
violation
of
the
right
until
you
haven't
received
a
fair
trial.
so
imagine
the
defendant
going
up
pretrial
on
mandamus
and
saying,
my
right
to
counsel
of
choice
has
been
violated.
the
appellate
court's
response
would
be,
well,
we
can't
decide
that.
we
don't
even
know
whether
it's
been
violated
until
we
see
the
record
that
develops
in
this
case
and
the
defense
that
your...
that
your
replacement
counsel
puts
on.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
scalia,
i
think
i'm
fairly
characterizing
the
government's
position
when
i
say
that
as
a
constitutional
matter,
they
say
there's
no
sixth
amendment
violation
until
we
see
what
happens
at
the
trial.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
that
they're
presenting
their
case,
justice
ginsburg,
and
this
is
important
because
what
the
government
is
saying
is
the
right
itself
is
not
violated
until
we
have
a
breakdown
in
the
adversarial
process
at
trial.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
you...
if
you
conceived
the
right
as
one
that
you
made
clear
there's
a
violation
at
the
moment
the
trial
court
impermissibly
denies
counsel
of
choice,
and
then
perhaps
to
say...
and
then
you
went
on
to
say
there's
either
an
automatic
reversal
rule
or
even
a
chapman
standard,
then
you
could
say
that
there
would
be
a
right
for
mandamus
on
appeal.
but
then
you
run
into
the
same
problem
of
flanagan.
and
then...
but
if
you
didn't
do
that
and
you
said
the
way
the
united
states--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--he
may
well
be.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
because--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
in
the
ordinary
case,
yes,
but
let
me
talk
about...
let
me
go
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
mean,
we
have
a
defendant
here
with
only
very
limited
funds.
he
may
decide
that
i
only
have
enough
money
to
pay
one
lawyer
for
one
trial,
and...
and
i
don't
want
to
depend
on
this
lawyer's
good
will
or
something.
i
mean,
so
we're
getting
down
the
line
to...
to
hypotheticals.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
i'll
accept
that
mandamus
doesn't
work.
and
justice
kennedy,
even
on...
even
on
this
record,
if
you
look
at
the
rule
of
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
for...
for
pro
hac
vice
admission,
it's
entirely
discretionary
on
its
face.
and
so
it's
hard
to
imagine
what
your
mandamus
argument
would
be.
and,
of
course,
here
the
eighth
circuit
just
issued
a
one
word
dismissal.
so
it's
our
position
that
for...
not
only
for
the
legal
reasons
of
the
historical
grounding
of...
of
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
and
the
logical
reasons
with
the
differences
between
the
government
interfering
with
what
the
defendant
wants
to
do
versus
the
situation
that
we
have
in
strickland
where
this
court
has
said
that
even
if...
if
the
government
doesn't
do
anything
at
all...
and
this
court
emphasized
in
strickland
that...
another
difference
between
strickland
and
this
case
is
the...
is
that
the
government
is
powerless
in
the
strickland
scenario
to
prevent...
to
prevent
the
constitutional
violation.
we
have
the
difference
here
of
the
government
acting
to
interfere
with
the
way
the
defendant
wants
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
sorry.
when
i
say
the
government,
i
mean
the
court
or
a
prosecutor.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
but
then
those
sorts
of
mistakes
aren't
necessarily
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
arguments,
i
don't
think,
mr.
chief
justice.
those
might
be
different
kinds
of
mistakes.
but
here,
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
court
interfering
with
the
right...
the
sixth
amendment
right
the
defendant
has.
and
in
the
cases
that
strickland
expressly
distinguished
and
which
the
united
states
accepts
in
footnote
3
of
its
brief
and
in
the
self
representation
cases,
which...
which
recognized
that
the
kernel
of
the
defendant's
right
is
to
present...
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
mckaskle.
the
core
faretta
right
is
the...
is
the
defendant's
right
to
present
the
case
to
the
jury
the
way
he
wants
to
submit
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
what
we
have
in...
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
lawyer
who
was
retained
and
who's...
who
is
willing
to
go
forward
under
that
retainer
and
in
a
pro
bono
sense.
so...
so,
i
mean,
even
under
this
court's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--even
under
the
current...
yes,
in
this
case.
even
under
the...
even
under
the
current
jurisprudence,
justice
alito,
you're
right.
the
defendant
sometimes
may
not
be
able
to
be
put
all
the
way
back
into
the
position
he...
he
would
have
been.
but
here,
we
submit
that
the
lower
court's
rule
of...
of
automatic
reversal
is
the
proper
rule.
it's
the
one
that's
working,
and
it's
the
one
this
court
should...
should
refuse
to
change
today.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it's
roughly...
roughly
half
the
circuits
have
addressed
this
issue
on
direct
appeal,
and
they've
all
said
this
is
structural
error,
justice
scalia.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit
the
case.
