mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
made
clear
in
its
jurisprudence
concerning
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
that
the
core
purpose
of
that
right
is
to
secure
a
fair
trial
conducted
in
accordance
with
adversary
procedures.
as
a
result
of
the
court's
analysis
of
that
purpose,
this
court
has
required
in
its
sixth
amendment
assistance
of
counsel
cases
either
a
showing
that
prejudice
be
demonstrated
in
a
particular
case
to
show
that
a
fair
trial
has
not
been
guaranteed
or
that
there
is
a
basis
for
presuming
prejudice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
believe
that
gideon
was
decided
in
1963,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
scalia,
in
fact,
this
court
has
recognized
that
under
the
sixth
amendment,
as
applied
to
the
federal
government,
even
before
the
sixth
amendment
was
made
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
it
did
guarantee
the
right
to
appointed
counsel
if
the
defendant--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--johnson
v.
zerbst,
i
believe,
was
in
the
'30's.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the...
the
fact--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
scalia,
our
position
on
what
the
purpose
of
the
assistance
of
counsel
clause
is...
is
drawn
from
what
this
court
has
said
that
purpose
is
in
the
way
that
it's
elaborated
it.
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
looks
at
the
spectrum
of
contexts
in
which
the
court
has
applied
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
it's
apparent
that
the
most
fundamental
aspect
of
the
guarantee
and
the
one
that
is
most
indispensable
to
protecting
the
fairness
of
a
trial,
which
is
the
overarching
goal
of
the
sixth
amendment,
is
that
the
defendant
have
counsel
by
his
side
at
all.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
i
think
that
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
core
element
of
fairness
is
protecting
the
defendant's
ability
to
have
a
lawyer
there
at
all,
and
if
the
lawyer
is
not
there,
the
essential
fairness
of
the
trial
is
in
jeopardy.
and
it's
for
that
reason--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
were--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
not
entirely
true,
justice
scalia,
because
there
certainly
were
many
jurisdictions,
even
at
the
time
of
the
founding,
that
provided
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
if
the
defendant
was
not
able
to
retain
his
own
counsel.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
this
court
has
done
i
think,
in
the
course
of
the
20th
century
jurisprudence
that
has
examined
the
right
to
counsel,
is
establish
a
hierarchy
of
the
critical
rights
that
are
necessary
for
a
fair
trial.
the
first,
of
course,
is
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
within
limits,
i
think
that
that's
certainly
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
but,
of
course,
this
case
and
many
of
the
cases
that
raise
this
issue
do
not
involve
a
situation
in
which
the
defendant
is
deprived
of
retained
counsel
with
whom
he
can
consult
and
whose
strategic
decisions
he
can
control
through
his
role
as
the
client.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
within
limits,
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
kennedy.
and
the
right
of
counsel
of
choice,
as
this
court
has
articulated
it
in
its
wheat
decision,
is
far
from
an
absolute
right.
it's
a
qualified
right
that
does
yield
to
interests
that
are
designed
to
protect
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it's
critical
in
this
case
that
it...
the
court
never
forced
a
lawyer
on
respondent
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
the
respondent
had
months
after
that
disqualification
was
made
clear
and
the
court
of
appeals
denied
mandamus
to
retain
a
different
counsel
if
he
chose
to
retain
a
different
counsel.
there's
no
showing
in
this
record
that
the
respondent
didn't
consult
with
the
lawyer
who
was
disqualified
and
with
the
lawyer
who
he
elected
to
have
represent
him
at
trial
and
not
determine
that
that
was
in
his
best
interest
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
was
disabled--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right,
and
that's
why
we
are
not
disagreeing
in
this
case
that
there's
been
an
infringement
of
his
constitutionally
protected
interest
in
having
counsel
of
choice.
but
the
question
for
this
court
is
how
should
that
be
defined
as
a
denial
of
a
sixth
amendment
right.
should
it
be
something
that
is
automatically
reversible
so
that
even
if
respondent
had--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
right
to
self
representation
is
unique.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
a
much
greater
right
because
it
protects
autonomy
interests
that
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
protects
it,
but
in
a
much--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there's
a
modest
element
of
autonomy
in
the
right
of
counsel
of
choice,
but
the
right
of
self
representation
is
complete
autonomy.
there
is
no
substitute
for
the
individual
defendant's
voice
in
the
courtroom.
there
is
no
representative
that
could
give
him
that
right.
and
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
the
right
to
self
representation
is
usually
a
right
that
redounds
negatively
for
the
defendant.
it
tends
to
produce
worse
trial
outcomes
for
the
defendant.
and
in
recognition
of
the
autonomy
as
independent
of
fair
trial
interests
that
are
protected
by
the
right
of
self
representation,
this
court
has
placed
it
in
that
very
small
group
of
rights
in
which
automatic
reversal
is
appropriate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
our
position
is
that
if
there
were
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion,
in
accordance
with
the
ordinary
mandamus
standards--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
government's
position
is
that
he
could
seek
a
writ
of
mandamus,
and
if
he
qualified
under
the
standards
for
mandamus,
then
he
could
obtain
relief.
this
court
has
already
held
in
the
flanagan
decision
that
there's
no
automatic
right
of
interlocutory
review
from
the
denial
of
counsel
of
choice,
and
the
court
did
that
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
either
the
right
could
be
vindicated
at
the
end
of
the
trial
or
it's
not
totally
separable
from
the
merits.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
it's
really
up
to
the
government.
the
defendant
can
seek
mandamus,
and
if
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
government's
position
is
that
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
defendant
could
satisfy
the
high
standards
required
for
mandamus.
and
certainly
if
the
government
believed
that
the
disqualification
was--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
government
doesn't
dispute
that
as
in
this...
as
this
court
held
in
wheat,
there's
a
presumption
in
favor
of
counsel
of
choice.
every
court
has
rules
that
govern
how
lawyers
are
to
enter
their
appearances
and
represent
defendants,
and
district
courts
can
make--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not
anytime,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that
would
effectively
overturn
this
court's
holding
in
flanagan,
that
there's
no
right
of
taking
a
collateral
order
appeal
in
every
single
case
involving
the
disqualification
of
counsel.
but
what's
critical
here,
i
think,
is
to
compare
the
position
of
a
defendant
who
has
no
counsel
at
all,
the
position
of
a
defendant
who
has
counsel
who's
laboring
under
a
conflict
of
interest,
the
position
of
a
defendant
who
has
a
counsel
who's
not
performing
competently,
who's
making
professionally
unreasonable
decisions.
only
in
the
first
of
those
instances
has
this
court
held
that
automatic
reversal
without
any
showing
of
prejudice
at
all
is
warranted.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
flanagan
held
that
there
was
no
collateral
order
appeal.
it
didn't
address
the
mandamus
question.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
rejecting--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
this
court
said
in
flanagan
is
that
if
the
defendant,
at
the
end
of
the
day...
and
if
was
the
operative
word...
could
obtain
automatic
reversal,
then
the
defendant's
interests
could
be
vindicated
at
the
end
of
trial.
and
if,
alternatively,
the
defendant
had
to
establish
prejudice,
then
the
interlocutory
appeal
would
fail
the
requirement
that
the
issue
be
totally
separate
from
the
merits,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
collateral
order
appeal.
and
flanagan
didn't
address
this
issue,
but
in
addressing
it,
i
suggest
that
this
court
should
look
at
the
way
that
it
has
protected
other
criminal
defendants'
rights
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
our...
our
standard
of
prejudice,
our
preferred
standard
of
prejudice,
is
the
same
as
under
strickland.
we
would
not
require
the
defendant
to
show
that
his
second
choice
retained
counsel
performed
incompetently.
second
choice
retained
counsel
can
perform
fully
competently
and
have
made
a
significantly
different
strategic
course
of
action
than
the
counsel
who
actually
went
to
trial,
and
that
could
easily
be
established
by
having
an
affidavit
or
testimony
submitted.
it's
actually
easier
than
conducting
a
strickland
inquiry
because
in
strickland,
you're
looking
at
the
way
counsel
performed
and
your
hypothesizing
how
a
competent
counsel
would
perform.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
alito,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
that
difficult.
i
think,
in
fact,
it's
easier
than
strickland
because
in
strickland,
you
have
to
look
at
one
lawyer
and
decide
whether
his
performance
was
not
competent
and
then
hypothesize
what
a
competent
lawyer
would
have
done,
and
then
conduct
the
counter
factual
inquiry
of
how
it
would
have
affected
the
trial.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
almost
invariably
occurs
in
every
strickland
case.
and
my
fundamental
submission
here
is
that
a
defendant
who
is
saddled
with
a
lawyer
who
performs
in
an
unprofessionally
incompetent
manner
cannot
overturn
his
conviction
without--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
but
i
think
that...
that
your
honor's
question
reveals
that
different
lawyers
will
make
different
strategic
judgments
and
assessing
the
impact
of
those
on
the
trial--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the...
the
remedy
that...
that
this
court
has
chosen
when
counsel
is
not
competent
requires
i
think
a...
a
systematic
inquiry.
i
wouldn't
call
it
entirely
speculative.
it's
a
focused
inquiry
into
what
the
impact
would
have
been
had
counsel
performed
differently.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
it
becomes
considerably
more
than
an
ineffective
assistance
case.
and
the
autonomy
interest
that's
being
protected
here
needs
to
be
viewed
in
relation
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
can
still
retain
his
counsel.
it's
not
that
he's
denied
all
choice
of
counsel.
he's
denied
his
first
choice
counsel
which--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--he
may
very
well
be
denied
that
choice,
justice
souter,
if
he
tries
to
retain
that
lawyer
and
that
lawyer
has
a
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
isn't
necessarily
second
best.
and
the
irony
of
respondent--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
if...
if
he
retains
somebody
else
and
that
person
obtains
a
complete
acquittal,
that...
that
individual
is,
no
doubt,
going
to
be
very
satisfied.
and
the
historical
example--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
souter,
i
think
what
it
illustrates
is
that
the
right
to
choose
counsel
is
connected
with
the
desirability,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
of
a
favorable
outcome.
and
it
is
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
apply
the
criteria
in
strickland.
and
this
has
a
variety
of
other
standards
that
it
could
choose
if
it
concluded
that
the
eighth
circuit's
rule
of
automatic
reversal
provides
an
unjustified
windfall
for
a
defendant
when
it's
considered
that
defendants
who...
this
would
basically
be
equating
the
right
of
counsel
of
choice,
which
is
available
only
to
about
10
percent
of
our
defendants
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
because
the
other
90
percent
don't
have
the
funds.
therefore,
they're
not
hiring
anyone.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
be
taken
away.
i
think
that
it
needs
to
be
protected.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
saying
that
they
have
it,
but
in
order
for
this
court
to
conclude
that
reversal
of
a
trial
that
can
be
presumed
fundamentally
fair,
because
the
defendant,
in
fact,
went
to
trial
with
counsel
who
he
had
chosen,
albeit
as
his
second
choice,
should
not
occur
with
all
of
the
societal
impacts
that
that
has,
the
potential
for
victims
to
have
to
go
through
a
retrial.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and...
and
we're
not
disputing
that
that
entitlement
exists.
the
question
is
whether
it
should
be
remedied
automatically,
which
puts
it
in
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
the
autonomy
interest
is
deserving
of
protection,
as
this
court
has
held,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i...
i
don't
agree
that
it's...
that
it
really
has
a
function
in
the
sixth
amendment
that's
independent
of
what
the
sixth
amendment
itself
says,
which
is
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense.
and
this
court
has
made
clear
that
in
the
context
in
which
it's
looked
at
and
involving
conflicted
counsel,
involving
ineffective
counsel,
involving
total
denial
of
counsel,
involving
appointment
of
counsel
or
even
the
retention
of
counsel
in
a
situation
where
no
lawyer
could
be
expected
to
perform
in
a
competent
manner
and
protect
the
defendant's
rights,
that
all
of
those
rights
and
interests
are
tied
to
the
basic
purpose
of
the
assistance
of
counsel
clause.
it
is
not
a
expressive
clause
in
the
middle
of
the
constitution.
it
is
not
a
mini
first
amendment.
it
is
a
right
that
is
tied
to
the
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee
in
helping
assure
fair
trial
outcomes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
why
this
court,
in
construing
this
right,
in
the
context
of
what
i
think
is
probably
the
most
critical
aspect
of
the
right,
once
you
have
a
lawyer
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
namely
the
right
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
the
court
has
looked
to
the
impact
on
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
now,
this
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
you
could
not
say
that,
justice
scalia.
this
court
did
not
infer
the
right
of
self
representation
from
the
assistance
of
counsel
clause.
it
inferred
it
from
the
network
of
rights
that
are
provided
in
the
sixth
amendment--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that's
accurate,
justice
scalia,
because
what
the
court
made
clear
in
its
self
representation
cases
is
that
there
was
an
important
historical
tradition
that
was
being
protected,
and
it's
being
protected
independent
of
the
defendant's
interest
in
a
successful
outcome.
it's
allowing
the
defendant
to
speak
to
the
jury
in
his
own
voice
because
there's
something
deemed
fundamentally
unfair
about
a
system
in
which
a
defendant
needs
to
go
to
prison
without
ever
having
been
able
to
speak
in
his
own
voice
to
a
courtroom.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
deny
that
there's
a
historical
tradition,
justice
souter.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
it's
a
very
qualified
one.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there...
the
point
that
the
court
relied
on
in
concluding
that
automatic
reversal
was
appropriate
for
denial
of
the
right
to
self
representation
included
the
critical
fact
that
this
is
not
a
right
that
proceeds
in
connection
with
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
its...
its
sole
existence
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
it
is
a
right
that
should
be...
an
interest
that
should
be
recognized,
and
it
is,
of
course,
recognized
in
wheat
by
saying
that
it's
comprehended
within
the
sixth
amendment.
there
is
a
qualified
interest
that
a
defendant
has
in
retaining
counsel
of
choice.
but
should
it
be
elevated
to
be
equated
with
the
total
denial
of
counsel?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
court
has
before
it
three
options
for
some
standard
that
would
not
consist
of
an
automatic
reversal
standard.
the
first,
and
the
government's
preferred
position,
is
that
the
defendant
should
come
in
and
show
what
counsel
of
first
choice
would
have
done
as
a
matter
of
strategy
and
show
that
if
he
had
pursued
that,
it
would
create
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
different
outcome,
the
same
test
as
in
strickland.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
more
favorable--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
the
same...
same
test
as
in
strickland.
it
doesn't
require
proof
that
more
likely
than
not
the
defendant
would
have
been
acquitted,
but
it
undermines
confidence
in
the
outcome.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think,
justice
scalia,
you'd
have
to
actually
look
at
the
specific
facts
of
the
case
and
make
a
determination.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
if
that's
because
any
court
would
conclude
that
that
defense
was
not
likely
to
prevail,
then
i
would
submit
that
the
proper
accommodation
of
the
societal
interest
in
respecting
a
final
judgment
and
protecting
the
interest...
the
qualified
interest
in
counsel
of
choice
is
properly
resolved.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
second
option
would
be
the
standard
that
the
seventh
circuit
selected
in
rodriguez
v.
chandler,
which
requires
a
showing
that
the
second
choice
lawyer
was
deficient
in
some
important
qualification
or
would...
pursued
a
different
strategic
interest
and
a
different
strategic
approach
than
first
choice
counsel,
and
that's
it.
more
analogous
to
this
court's
conflicts
jurisprudence
where,
when
there
is
simultaneous
multiple
representation,
it's
sufficient
for
the
defendant
to
show
a
different
strategic
approach
that
was
not
taken
because
the
conflict
caused
the...
the
lawyer
not
to
do
that,
and
there's
no
requirement
of
outcome
determinativeness
that
goes
along
with
that.
and
the
third
alternative
would
simply
be
to
provide
a
harmless
error
standard,
instead
of
deeming
this
to
be
structural
error,
equating
it
with
a
biased
judge,
total
denial
of
counsel,
racial
discrimination
in
the
grand
jury.
this
court
could
provide
a
standard
in
which
it's
the
government's
burden
to
show
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
in
cases
of
overwhelming
evidence,
the
government
could
establish.
and
although,
i
acknowledge,
justice
souter,
that
the
autonomy
interest
would
be,
to
a
certain
extent,
lost
in
that
instance,
there
are
many
rights,
many
interests
that
are
sacrificed
and
not
deemed
remediable
when
the
error
is
found
harmless.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
souter,
i...
i
do
want
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
but
the
point
is
that
a
defendant
who
has
his
second
choice
opportunity
of
counsel
is
able
to
express
his
autonomy
interests
in
a
much
more
significant
way
than
a
defendant
who
is
denied
the
right
to
self
representation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
respondent's
submission
in
the
eighth
circuit's
holding
in
this
case
is
fundamentally
anomalous
in
two
respects.
the
first
is
that
it
is
anomalous
when
compared
to
the
other
rights
that
this
court
has
acknowledged
protection
of
under
the
sixth
amendment
because
it
accords
to
a
defendant
who
had
the
full
opportunity
to
select
his
counsel
and
to
select
a
backup
counsel
the
same
remedy
as
a
defendant
who
had
no
lawyer
at
all.
and
it's
anomalous
factually
because
a
defendant
who
is
deprived
of
his
first
choice
counsel
may
have
selected
that
counsel
improvidently,
may
select
his
second
choice
counsel
with
much
greater
care,
may
obtain
a
lawyer
who
is
far
more
competent
and
far
more
effective,
and
all
of
those
things
have
to
be
discarded
on
respondent's
view
and
the
eighth
circuit's
holding
and
automatic
reversal
ordered,
forcing
society
to
bear
the
costs
of
a
retrial
even
when
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
or
it
is
a
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
no
lawyer
could
have
made
a
difference.
and
the
proper
accommodation
of
the
values
that
are
at
stake
in
this
case
is
to
recognize
that
some
form
of
prejudice
inquiry
is
appropriate
before
this
court
imposes
on
the
judicial
system
the
extreme
consequence
of
automatic
reversal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
the
seventh
circuit
made
perfectly
clear
in
the
rodriguez
case
that
it
was
rejecting
on
the
merits
the
view
that
automatic
reversal
is
warranted.
and
the
view
that
automatic
reversal
is
warranted
largely
arose
from
a
misunderstanding
of
this
court's
flanagan
decision
in
which
dictum
was
quoted
as
if
it
were
a
holding
and
because
the
courts
failed
to
triangulate
the
right
in
question
here
with
the
right
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
ineffectiveness
context
and
in
the
conflicts
context.
thank
you.
