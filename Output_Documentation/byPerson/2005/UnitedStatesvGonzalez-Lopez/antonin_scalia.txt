justice
antonin
scalia
when
did...
when
did
we
first
hold
that
the
state
had
to
provide
counsel
if...
if
the
defendant
could
not
afford
his
own
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
we
generally
mean
nowadays
by
the
right...
by...
by
the
right
to
counsel.
and
when
you
talk
about
fairness
being
its
objective,
you're
talking
about
the
objective
of
that
newly
discovered
right
to
have
counsel
appointed.
but
i
don't
know
that
fairness
was
the...
was
the
object
of
the
original
right
to
counsel
in
the...
in
the
bill
of
rights,
which...
which
only
applied
to...
to
your
ability
to
hire
your
own
counsel,
and
if
you
couldn't
afford
counsel,
you
didn't
get
one.
i
hardly
think
that...
that
fairness
is
the
object
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
when...
when
was
our
first
holding
to
that
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
'30's.
gee,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
hardly...
that's
hardly
the
original
purpose
and
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and...
and
you
come
here
and
say
that
its
fundamental
purpose
is
something
that
is
only
the
purpose
of
the
newly
evolved
sixth
amendment
and
not
of
the
original
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that's
the
overarching
goal
of
the
original.
i
think
it's...
it's
very
fundamental,
that
if
you
have
funds
with
which
you
can
hire
someone
to
speak
for
you,
you
should
be
able
to
use
all
of
your...
i
mean,
your...
no.
your...
your
freedom
is
at
stake.
you
should
be
able
to
use
all
of
your
money
to
get
the
best
spokesman
for
you
as
possible.
that's
the
element
of
fairness
that
i
think
is
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
until
the
1930's
that
element
didn't
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
until
the
1930's,
if
you
didn't
have
the
money,
you
didn't
have
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned,
if
you
didn't
have
the
money,
you
didn't
have
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
was
just
disabled
from...
from
his
first
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
told
him
you
can't
have
the
counsel
you
want.
go
find
somebody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
flanagan,
the
case
that
denied
mandamus
on
this
issue...
did
it
assume
any
resolution
of
the
question
whether
if...
if
you
can't
have
counsel
of
your
choice,
in
order
to
get
your
conviction
reversed,
you
have
to
show...
you
have
to
show
that
the
error
was
not
harmless?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i
would
certainly
think
that
it's
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
you
allow
immediate
appeal,
what
the
consequences
of
not
allowing
immediate
appeal
are.
if
you're
totally
deprived
of
your
right,
you...
you
might
allow
it
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't...
i
don't
want...
i
don't
want
a
competent
lawyer.
i
want
a
lawyer
who's
going
to
get
me
off.
[laughter]
i
want
a
lawyer
who
will
invent
the
twinkie
defense.
i
would...
i
would
not...
i
would
not
consider
the
twinkie
defense
an
invention
of
a
competent
lawyer.
but...
but
i
want
a
lawyer
who's
going
to
win
for
me.
and...
and
there's
no
way
to
predict
what
lawyer
has
a
charming
way
with
the
jury
or...
or
brings
in
some...
some
side
matters
that
maybe
shouldn't
be
brought
in
but
the
judge
is
silly
enough
to
let
them
in.
i
want
to
win.
and...
and
the
criterion
for
winning
is
not
how
competent
is
the
lawyer
necessarily.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
fair
trial.
nobody
is
saying
it
wasn't
a
fair
trial,
but
he
didn't
have
the
lawyer
he
wanted.
i
mean,
we
could
assure
everybody
a
fair
trial
by
allowing
nobody
to
pick
their
lawyers
and
assigning
lawyers
to
everybody.
that
would...
that
would
accomplish
fair
trials
throughout
the
united
states,
but
that's
not
the
system
we
have.
you're...
you're
entitled
to
the
lawyer
that
you
want.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you...
you
could
say
the...
you
could
say
the
same
thing,
counsel,
about
his
right
to
self
representation,
that
he
has
the
right
to
self
representation
for
his
defense
or
for
his--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
it
is
limited
to
the
right
of
self
representation
for
his
defense,
just
as
his
choice
of
counsel
is
limited
to
his
choice
of
counsel
for
his
defense.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
think
that
would
work
with
the
twinkie
defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
any
court
would
conceivably
reverse
the...
the
disqualification
of
counsel
on
the
ground
that
he
would
have
come
up
with
that
defense
and
win.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
he
can
also
reject
an
appointed
counsel.
can't
he
go
to
the
court
and
say,
i...
you
know,
i
don't
like
this
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
know
it
happens.
justice
antonin
scalia
or...
or
my
uncle
vinnie.
what
about
the
real...
the
real
case
of
my
uncle
vinnie?
there's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
a
real
estate
lawyer
or
not.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
entitled
to
represent
yourself
on
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm...
i'm
not
sure
you're
properly
characterizing
the...
the
government's
position.
i
mean,
you...
you
don't
have
to
assert
that
the
right
is
not
violated
until...
until
there's
an
unfair
trial
in
order
to
take
the
position
that
the
government
takes.
i
mean,
the
right...
a
lot
of
rights
that
are
later
reviewed
for
harmless
error
or
for...
to
see
whether
there
was
prejudice
were
violated
at
the
time,
and
not...
not
just
on
the
basis
of
whether
there
was
prejudice
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
you
compel
him
to
seek
mandamus
on
pain
of
losing
the
constitutional
claim,
your...
every
incentive
is
to
go
right
ahead
with
the
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
the
mandamus
solution
works
unless
you
compel
mandamus,
unless
you
say
you
lose...
you
lose
the
claim
unless
you
bring
mandamus.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many...
how
many
circuits
are
applying
that
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
8h
circuit.
the
respondent,
gonzalez-lopez,
was
charged
with
conspiracy
to
distribute
marijuana
in
the
eastern
district
of
missouri.
the
district
court
repeatedly
rejected
motions
of
the
out-of-state
attorney
that
gonzalez-lopez
had
hired
to
be
allowed
to
represent
him.
a
different
attorney
represented
gonzalez-lopez
at
trial,
and
he
was
convicted.
he
appealed,
the
8h
circuit
concluded
that
the
district
court’s
error
in
excluding
gonzalez-lopez’s
chosen
counsel
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
have
the
counsel
of
choice
and
that
this
violation
was
not
subject
to
harmless-error
review;
it
therefore
vacated
the
conviction.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
8th
circuit.
the
sixth
amendment
provides
that,
“in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense”.
this
gives
a
defendant
who
can
afford
counsel
the
right
to
choose
who
will
represent
him.
the
government
concedes
that
gonzalez-lopez’s
chosen
counsel
was
improperly
excluded,
but
it
contends
that
any
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
requires
a
showing
of
prejudice,
that
is,
a
showing
that
it
affected
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
the
right
has
been
accorded,
the
government
argues,
not
for
its
own
sake,
but
for
the
affect
it
has
on
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
so
that
if
the
trial
has
not
been
unfair,
or
at
least
if
the
defendant
cannot
show
that
it
would
have
come
out
differently,
no
harm
has
been
done.
it
is
true
enough
that
the
purpose
of
the
rights
set
forth
in
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
ensure
a
fair
trial;
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
rights
can
be
disregarded
so
long
as
the
trial
is
on
the
whole
fair.
the
government’s
line
of
reasoning
abstracts
from
the
right
to
its
purpose
and
then
eliminates
the
right.
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
of
choice
commands
not
that
a
trial
be
fair,
but
that
a
particular
guarantee
of
fairness
be
provided,
to
wit,
that
the
accused
be
defended
by
the
counsel
he
believes
to
be
best.
the
cases
the
government
relies
on
involve
a
different
right,
namely,
the
right
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
even
if
you
have
selected
your
own
counsel,
if
that
counsel
turns
out
to
be
incompetent,
the
sixth
amendment
is
violated.
violation
of
that
right,
the
right
to
effective
assistance,
generally
does
require
a
defendant
to
establish
that
the
incompetence
affected
the
outcome
of
the
trial;
but
because
we
derived
the
right
to
effective
representation
from
the
purpose
of
assuring
a
fair
trial,
it
is
unsurprising
that
we
have
also
derived
the
limits
of
that
right
from
that
same
purpose.
counsel
has
not
been
effective
unless
his
mistakes
have
harmed
the
defense.
the
right
to
select
the
counsel
of
one’s
choice,
by
contrast,
was
not
derived
from
the
sixth
amendment’s
purpose
of
ensuring
a
fair
trial.
it
has
been
regarded
as
the
root
meaning
of
the
constitutional
guarantee.
where
counsel
is
wrongly
denied,
therefore,
ineffectiveness
or
prejudice
need
not
be
shown
to
establish
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
if
a
defendant
is
erroneously
prevented
from
being
represented
by
the
lawyer
he
wants,
the
constitutional
violation
is
complete,
regardless
of
the
quality
of
the
lawyer
that
filled
in
for
the
counsel
the
defendant
actually
wanted.
erroneous
depravation
of
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
has
consequences
that
are
necessarily
unquantifiable
and
indeterminate.
who
knows
what
differences
in
strategy
or
even
differences
in
presentation
the
counsel
of
choice
might
have
brought
to
the
case?
he
might
have
conducted
more
intensive
investigation
or
had
a
different
theory
of
defense;
he
might
have
exercised
peremptory
challenges
against
different
jurors;
he
might
have
conducted
cross-examination-more
effectively;
he
might
have
had
a
more
charming
way
with
the
jury;
he
might
have
been
more
trusted
by
the
prosecutor,
enabling
him
to
negotiate
a
more
favorable
plea
bargain;
or
he
might
have
counseled
plea
bargaining
where
the
replacement
counsel
did
not.
the
denial
of
counsel
of
choice
just
thus
defies
analysis
by
harmless-error
standards,
because
it
affects
the
whole
framework
within
which
the
trial
proceeds.
the
government’s
analogy
to
ineffectiveness
cases
is,
again,
unpersuasive.
in
those
cases,
we
can
normally
assess
how
incompetent
counsels’
identified
mistakes
affected
the
outcome
of
a
trial.
nothing
we
have
said
today
casts
any
doubt
or
places
any
qualification
upon
our
previous
holdings
that
limit
the
right
of
counsel
of
choice
and
recognize
the
authority
of
trial
courts
to
establish
criteria
for
admitting
lawyers
to
argue
before
them.
however
broad
a
court’s
discretion
may
be,
the
government
has
conceded
that
the
district
court
here
erred
when
it
denied
respondent
his
choice
of
counsel.
accepting
that
premise,
we
hold
that
the
error
violated
respondent’s
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
of
choice
and
that
this
violation
is
not
subject
to
harmless-error
analysis.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit
is
affirmed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
kennedy
and
thomas
join.
