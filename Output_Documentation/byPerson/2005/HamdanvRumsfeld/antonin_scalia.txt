justice
antonin
scalia
where
was
that
change
made
from
the
prior
version?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but,
i
mean,
what...
it
was
made
in
what
house?
was
it
made
by
the
conference
committee?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
made
in
the
senate.
so
the
house
presumably
never
saw
the
prior--
justice
antonin
scalia
--language.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
president,
who
signed
this
bill,
never
saw
the
prior
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
why
should
we
attribute
to
both
the
house
and
to
the
president
a
knowledge
of
the
prior
version
of
the
legislation?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
senate.
justice
antonin
scalia
please
go
over
that
again.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
i
understood...
i
understood
your
response.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
it
could
be
read
to
preclude
cases
in
the
lower
courts,
but
not
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
come
back
to
justice
alito's
question
as
to
what
the
normal
procedure
would
be
in
criminal
cases?
suppose
you're...
you
have
a
challenge
to
the
makeup
of
the
tribunal
in
a
criminal
case.
is
it...
is
it
the
normal
practice
that
you
would
get
to
raise
that
challenge?
let's
say
one
of
the
judges
is
disqualified
for
some
other
reason.
can
you
normally
raise
that
challenge
before
the
criminal
case
is
filed?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
there
would
be
nothing
different
in
this
situation,
if
you
couldn't
raise
it
until
it
was
final.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
issue.
i'm
just
talking
about
the
timing
of
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
when
you
say
congress
hasn't
fairly
balanced
it,
i
mean,
i
guess
that
depends
upon
your
reading
of
the
statute.
if,
indeed,
you
read
it
the
way
the
government
reads
it,
they
would
assert
that
congress
did
consider
these
military
commissions
and
thought
that
it
was
okay
to
wait
until
they
had
completed
their
work
before
full
review
was
provided.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
a...
you
know,
a...
you're
running
in
a
circle.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
recall
the
sixth
amendment,
you're
entitled
to
know
the
charge
against
you.
and
you're
saying
that
the
charge
of
conspiracy
is
not
the
charge
of
aiding
and
abetting.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
the
existence
of
things
called
commissions.
or
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
the
use
of
them
if
they
have
to
follow
all
of
the
procedures
required
by
the
ucmj?
i
mean,
i
thought
that
the
whole
object
was
to
have
a
different
procedure.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
katyal,
you've
addressed
the
detainee
treatment
act
in
its...
in
its
capacity
as,
arguably,
removing
jurisdiction.
might
not
the
act
also
function
as
a
retroactive
approval
of
what
the
president
has
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
"regularly
constituted".
in
your
brief,
i
gather
you...
what
you
meant
is
that
a
court
that
was
preexisting.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that.
it
just...
it
could
mean
one
that
was
set
up
for
the
occasion,
but
was
set
up
for
the
occasion
by
proper
procedures.
wouldn't
that
be
a
"regularly
constituted
court"?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
not
ad
hoc
in
that
sense,
"i'm
creating
one
court
for
this
defendant,
another
court
for
the
other
defendant.
"
but
setting
up
for
the
occasion,
and
for
trying
numerous
defendants,
a
new
court.
i
don't
think
that,
just
because
it's
a
new
court,
you
can
say
that
it's
not
a
"regularly
constituted
court".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
we...
i
thought
we
established,
earlier...
somebody
told
me...
that,
in
the
normal
criminal
suit,
even
if
you
claim
that
the
forum
is
not
properly
constituted,
that
claim
is
not
adjudicated
immediately,
it's
adjudicated
at
the
conclusion
of
the
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
don't...
we
don't
intervene
on
habeas
corpus
when
somebody
says
that
the
panel
is
improperly
constituted.
we
wait
until
the
proceeding's
terminated,
normally.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
a
forum
that
is
prima
facie
properly
constituted.
i
mean,
it...
this
is
not
a...
you
know,
a
necktie
party.
where
it
parades
as
a
court,
and
it's
been
constituted
as
a
court,
we
normally
wait
until
the
proceeding's
completed.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
surely--
justice
antonin
scalia
--set
forth
a
procedure
which
amounts
to
a
suspension
of
the
writ.
and
if
that
procedure
is
done
in
a
state
of
insurrection
or
invasion,
that
would
constitute
a
suspension
of
the
writ,
even
though
they
don't
say,
"we
are
suspending
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
congress
chose
to
do
that.
one
house
of
congress
chose
to
do
it.
we
don't
know
what
the
other
house
thought,
and
we
don't
know
what
the
president
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
be
interested
in
your
answer,
if
you
can
get
it
out.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought...
i
thought...
i
thought
you
said
all
prisoners
of
war
were
uniquely
vulnerable...
i
thought
that
was
the
point
you
were
making--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
had...
needed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--needed
protection
of
the...
of
the
supervising
powers,
or
whatever
they're
called.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
is
a
mere
24
pages.
it
relates,
however,
solely
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
in
my
view,
it
is
clear
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
pronounce
the
opinion
it
has
released
today.
it
is
easy
to
explain
why.
on
december
30th
of
last
year,
congress
enacted
the
detainee
treatment
act,
or
dta.
this
statute
provides
that
as
of
last
december
30,
"no
court,
justice
or
judge
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
or
consider
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
by
or
on
behalf
of
an
alien
detained
at
guantanamo
bay."
that
language
is
perfectly
clear
and
unambiguous.
as
of
last
december
30,
no
court
or
justice,
including
this
court
and
these
nine
justices,
had
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
habeas
petition
of
hamdan,
who
is
an
alien
detained
at
guantanamo
bay.
to
make
what
is
clear
doubly-clear,
there
is
a
long,
long
line
of
supreme
court
precedent
holding
that
a
statute
eliminating
jurisdiction
applies
to
pending
cases
unless
it
contains
an
explicit
reservation
saying
that
it
does
not,
which
this
statute
does
not
contain.
to
quote
one
of
those
cases,
"this
rule,
that
when
a
law
conferring
jurisdiction
is
repealed
without
any
reservation
as
to
pending
cases,
all
cases
fall
with
the
law,
has
been
adhered
to
consistently
by
this
court."
today's
is
the
first
case
in
american
history,
and
perhaps
anglo-american
history,
in
which
a
court
has
failed
to
apply
to
pending
cases
a
statute
ousting
jurisdiction
that
did
not
contain
an
explicit
exception
for
pending
cases,
and
the
cases
coming
out
the
other
way
are
legion.
the
court
today
ignores
this
rule
and
finds
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
does
not
mean
what
it
says
on
the
basis
of
the
flimsiest
of
reasons.
it
relies
first
on
a
so-called
"negative
inference",
drawn
from
the
fact
that
the
dta
explicitly
says
that
two
other
provisions
are
applicable
to
pending
cases.
it
does
not
explicitly
say
that
this
provision
is.
there
is
no
such
negative
inference
for
a
number
of
reasons,
including
most
prominently
the
fact
that
there
was
good
reason
to
make
the
inclusion
of
pending
cases
explicit
for
these
other
provisions,
which
conferred
new
jurisdiction
rather
than
eliminating
old
jurisdiction
and
thus
did
not
benefit
from
the
invariable
rule
of
inclusion
applicable
to
elimination
of
jurisdiction.
moreover
--
and
this
is
truly
ironic
--
by
finding
a
negative
inference,
the
court
makes
a
nullity
of
the
very
provisions
from
which
the
negative
inference
is
drawn.
those
provisions
confer
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
certain
categories
of
guantanamo
cases
upon
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
explicitly
effective
with
regardto
pending
cases.
but
when
the
court
today
finds
that
the
ouster
of
the
jurisdiction
of
habeas
courts
is
not
effective
with
regard
to
pending
cases,
that
prescribed
exclusivity
of
these
other
two
provisions
is
utterly
destroyed.
habeas
courts
now
retain
jurisdiction
over
every
single
habeas
petition
of
a
guantanamo
detainee
that
was
pending
last
december
30,
when
the
dta
was
enacted.
there
are
hundreds
of
such
petitions;
so
that
today's
jurisdictional
decision
ensures
that
guantanamo
litigation
will
continue
in
district
courts
for
many
years
to
come.
the
court
tries
to
find
a
fig
leaf
for
its
interpretation
of
the
dta
in
the
statute's
legislative
history.
this
attempt
results
in
one
of
our
most
unfortunate
uses
of
legislative
history
in
recent
decades,
and
that
is
saying
something.
not
only
is
the
court's
use
of
the
floor
debate
openly
selective,
there
are
statements
to
the
contrary
of
the
ones
it
relies
upon.
but
the
fragments
of
senatorial
speeches
that
it
relies
upon
were
quite
clearly
deliberately
prepared
by
the
staff
of
tiny
handful
of
senators
to
be
cited
in
the
briefs
of
this
very
litigation,
which
the
senate
knew
was
pending
when
it
enacted
the
bill.
what
makes
matters
even
worse,
however,
is
that
even
we
had
habeas
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
under
ordinary
principles
of
sound
equitable
discretion
--
habeas
is
an
equitable
remedy
--
we
would
normally
not
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
under
the
dta,
every
single
one
of
hamdan's
claims
will
receive
full
consideration
by
article
3
courts,
once
he
has
exhausted
his
military
and
the
executive
branch
appeals.
in
the
past,
we
have
abstained
from
interfering
with
ongoing
court-martial
proceedings,
even
though
we
had
jurisdiction,
reserving
consideration
of
objections
to
later
judicial
review.
in
a
case
called
councilman,
we
abstained
from
interfering
with
ongoing
military
proceedings
relating
to
such
a
relatively
insignificant
matter
as
prosecution
for
a
serviceman's
possession
of
marijuana.
today,
by
contrast,
the
court
rushes
forward
to
uphold
an
unprecedented
injunction
against
ongoing
military
commission
proceedings
that
relate
to
a
far
more
serious
charge,
namely,
that
hamdan
joined
and
actively
abetted
the
murderous
conspiracy
that
slaughtered
thousands
of
american
civilians
without
warning
on
september
11,
2001.
our
interference
in
this
case
over
the
executive's
objection
creates
significant
and
wholly
gratuitous
inter-branch
conflict
in
an
area
where
we
have
no
expertise.
the
most
notable
feature
of
today's
principle
opinion
is
that
it
brushes
aside
one
after
another
long-settled
doctrine
in
order
to
reach
its
desired
result.
i
have
spoken
only
of
doctrines
pertaining
to
jurisdiction.
justice
thomas'
opinion,
which
i
join
and
which
he
will
describe,
speaks
to
the
merits.
when
all
of
these
ignored
doctrines
on
jurisdiction
and
on
the
merits
are
combined,
they
form
an
impressive
list.
they
include
the
rule
that
repeals
of
jurisdiction
apply
to
pending
cases;
the
rule
that
legislative
history
and
oblique
structural
references
cannot
be
used
to
distort
the
unambiguous
words
of
a
statute;
the
rule
that
we
should
avoid
unnecessary
conflict
with
the
executive,
especially
in
areas
where
his
expertise
is
maximal
and
ours
is
minimal,
if
not
nonexistent;
the
rule
that
determinations
about
the
nature
and
scope
of
an
armed
conflict
are
solely
committed
to
the
executive;
the
rule
that
the
offenses
chargeable
before
a
military
commission
are
determined
with
reference
to
the
experience
of
our
wars
and
with
great
deference
to
the
executive;
the
rule
that
the
president
has
virtually
unfettered
authority
to
prescribe
the
jurisdiction
and
procedure
of
military
commissions;
the
rule
that
the
executive's
interpretation
of
a
treaty
provision
is
entitled
to
great
weight;
and
the
rule
that
constitutional
claims
based
on
contingent
events
are
unripe,
especially
when
they
challenge
an
anticipated
action
of
the
political
branches
that
may
never
occur.
our
past
practice
has
always
been
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution
and
deference
to
the
executive
in
cases
involving
the
prosecution
of
warfare
and
judgments
about
the
appropriate
use
of
military
power,
including
the
power
to
try
enemy
captives.
today,
that
edifice
of
caution
and
deference
comes
crashing
down.
the
court
takes
on
a
new
role
as
active
manager
of
the
details
of
military
conflicts.
we
bring
neither
lawful
jurisdiction
nor
competence
to
the
performance
of
this
role.
for
all
these
reasons,
i
vigorously
dissent.
