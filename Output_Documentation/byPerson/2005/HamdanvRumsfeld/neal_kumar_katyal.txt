mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
we
ask
this
court
to
preserve
the
status
quo
to
require
that
the
president
respect
time
honored
limitations
on
military
commissions.
these
limits,
placed
in
articles
21
and
36
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
require
no
more
than
that
the
president
try
offenses
that
are,
indeed,
war
crimes
and
to
conduct
trials
according
to
the
minimal
procedural
requirements
of
the
ucmj
and
the
laws
of
war
themselves.
these
limits
do
not
represent
any
change
in
the
way
military
commissions
have
historically
operated.
rather,
they
reflect
congress's
authority
under
the
define
and
punish
clause
to
codify
limits
on
commissions,
limits
that
this
court
has
historically
enforced
to
avoid
presidential
blank
checks.
and
because
this
commission
transgresses
those
limits,
it
should
be
struck
down
and
the
district
court
order
reinstated.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
jurisdictional
matter
for
a
few
moments
first,
we
believe
that
the
dta,
while
certainly
not
a
model
of
clarity,
does
not
divest
this
court
of
jurisdiction,
for
four
essential
reasons.
the
first
is
that,
if
i
could
turn
to
the
surreply
at
page...
the
appendix
at
page
14(a),
that
contains
the
initial
version
of
the
bill
that
passed
the
senate
on
november
10th.
and
at
14(a)
it
says,
on
the
effective
date
provision,
"the
amendment
made
by
paragraph
1.
"
which
is
the
jurisdiction
stripping
provision,
"shall
apply
to
any
application
or
other
action
that
is
pending
on
or
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act.
"
that
language
clearly
attempted
to
strip
courts
of
jurisdiction
over
guantanamo
claims.
that
language,
however,
was
changed
in
the
final
version
of
the
dta,
and
the
final
version
of
the
dta
is
found
at
page
10(a)
of
the
surreply.
and
that
has
the
following
as
its
effective
date.
it
has
two
effective
date
provisions.
the
first
one
i
want
to
start
with
is
h(2),
review
of
combatant
status
tribunal,
csrt,
and
military
commission
decisions,
"paragraphs
2
and
3
of
subsection
(e)
shall
apply
with
respect
to
any
claim
whose
review
is
governed
by
one
of
such
paragraphs
and
that
is
pending
on
or
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
act.
"
and
then,
there
is
a
separate
provision
for
the
rest
of
the
dta,
for--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
change
was
made
between
november
10th
and
november
15th.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
was
made
in
the
senate.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that's
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
because
the
language
itself
was,
i
think,
the
subject
of
an
immense
amount
of
debate.
and,
indeed,
when
the
language
was--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--in
the
senate.
and
well
known.
and,
indeed,
you
don't
have
to
attribute
any
knowledge
to
the
president.
we
have
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
administration
tried
to
change
the
language
back
to
the
original
formulation.
and,
indeed,
in
the
house,
the
chairman
of
one
of
the...
the
vice
chairman
of
the
conference
report
said
that
the
change
in
the
language
was
in...
was...
the
change
in
the
language
meant
that
it
grandfathered
pending
cases
such
as
this
one.
so,
this
is
not
an
example
of
which
we
have
to
resort
simply
to
the
negative
inference
of
lindh.
however,
we
do
think
that
is
the
second
reason
for
you
to
believe
that
this
case
is
grandfathered
under
the
existing
dta.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
believe
that,
as
the
cosponsor
said,
on
november
15th
when
they
introduce
the
final
version
of
the
language,
that
all
of
those
cases
are
grandfathered
with
respect
to
the
h(1)
effective
date
provision
and
the
e(1)
jurisdiction
stripping
provision.
however,
that
still
leaves
in
place
the
government's
main
argument
in
the
d.c.
circuit
below,
which
is
that
the
e(2)
provision
governing
csrt
and
final
decisions,
and
the
h(2)
provision
governing
final
decisions
of...
final
decisions
of
csrts,
truncates
all
of
the
review
that
is
currently
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
so,
it's
certainly...
it's
certainly
possible,
though
it's
not,
of
course,
presented
in
this
case,
to
read
the
dta
as
truncating
the
vast
majority
of
claims
at
guantanamo
in
current
pending
cases.
of
course,
that
isn't
the
issue
before
you
here.
the
issue
before
you
here
is
simply
the
hamdan
case,
and
there
was...
and
there
was
a
strong...
the
strong
desire
by
the
congress
not
to
interfere
with
this
court's
traditionally
exercised
jurisdiction.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
okay.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
right,
cases
in
which
there
is
a
final
csrt
decision;
that
is,
that
the
government's
argument
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
justice
scalia,
is
that
there
are
two
different
ways
in
which
the
dta
truncated
the
review
of
guantanamo
cases.
one
is
the
claim
that
the
jurisdiction
stripping
provision
applies
to
pending
cases.
that,
we
reject.
that,
we
think
the
senate
rejected
on
november
15th
when
it
passed
the
bill.
the
other
is
the
claim
that
the
e(2)
provision
governing
final
decisions
of
csrts,
which
does,
of
course,
apply
to
pending
cases,
as
the
plain
text
says,
eliminates
and
truncates
a...
the
vast
majority
of
the
detainees'
claims.
that
is
the
provision--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--to
be
clear,
that's
not
the
position
we're
saying
that
is
the
dta.
that's
not
presented
here.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
the
issue--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--below,
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
in
addition,
we
believe
that
this
statute
doesn't
fall
within
the
bruner
hallowell
presumption
that
the
government
seeks
to...
seeks
to
use
here,
for
a
few
reasons.
the
first
is,
this
is
not
a
statute
that
is
merely
divesting
a
lower
court
of
jurisdiction.
rather,
it's
a
statute
that
alters
substantive
rights
of
mr.
hamdan.
in
particular,
as
the
government
itself
says,
it
eliminates
question
2,
upon
which
certiorari
was
granted,
which
is
compliance
with
the
geneva
conventions.
in
addition,
it
alters
entirely
what
both
courts
below
found,
which
is
that
mr.
hamdan
has
a
pretrial
right,
a
right
analogous
to
abney
versus
united
states,
to
bring
his
claim
now,
because
he's
challenging
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribunal.
that
pretrial
right
is
something
that
mirrors...
that
goes
all
the
way
back
to
the
founding,
in
the
early
cases
that
this
court
decided,
on
pretrial
habeas.
in
addition,
we
believe
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
as
the
government
says,
it
does...
certainly
does
not
encompass
question
2,
because
it
eliminates
the
word
"treaties".
it's
a
change
from
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
more
generally,
it
doesn't
do
two
things.
first,
if
that's
the
reading
that
the
government
wants
to
give,
well,
then
it
essentially
means
that
the...
that
the
president
has
the
ability
to
block
habeas
corpus
or
post
dta
review
for
all
time,
because,
justice
alito,
it
doesn't
turn
on...
you
can't
walk
into
court
right
after
you're
convicted,
under
the
dta;
you
can
only
walk
into
court
after
a
final
decision.
and
a
final
decision
requires
the
sign
off
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
and
so,
effectively,
this
reading
would
give
a
litigant
the
ability
to
block
federal
court
review
for
all
time.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia...
justice
alito,
if
this
were
a
final...
if
this
were
like
a
criminal
proceeding,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
the
whole
point
of
this
is
to
say
we're
challenging
the
lawfulness
of
the
tribunal
itself.
this
isn't
a
challenge
to
some
decision
that
a
court
makes.
this
is
a
challenge
to
the
court
itself.
and
that's
why
it's
different
than
the
ordinary
criminal
context
that
you're
positing.
the
ordinary
criminal
context
you're
positing...
and
i'm
thinking
of
a
case
like
schlesinger
versus
councilman,
a
court
martial
case...
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
it's
the...
the
predicate
for
abstention
is
the
idea
that
congress
has
fairly
balanced
the
rights
of
both
sides,
an
independent
branch,
and
has...
and
has
made
certain
determinations.
here,
none
of
that
has
happened.
it's
all
been
made
by
the
executive.
and
the
difference
is
crucial
in
military
justice,
because,
as
justice
kennedy
said
for
the
court
in
loving,
the
framers
harbored
a
deep
distrust
of
military
tribunals.
and
the
thing
that
makes
it
different
than
the
ordinary
criminal
context,
the
thing
that,
as
this
court
said,
stops
military
justice
from
being
lawless
is
the
congress
of
the
united
states
setting
clear
limits
on
the
use
of
military
justice.
now,
if
those
limits
had
been
observed,
if
this
court...
if
the
military
commission
complied
with
the
rules
of
courts
martial,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
our
whole
point
is
that
they
don't,
and
that
it
falls
outside
of
the
well
recognized
abstention
exception
for
courts
martial
cases.
in
addition,
we
believe
that
to
further...
to
further
on...
justice
alito,
on
your
point...
this
point
is
already
said
in
the
military
commission
context
that
a
different
rule
applies.
in
quirin,
this
court
rushed
in
to
hear
a
military
commission
challenge
before
the
commission
was
over,
and
the
reason
why
it
did
so
was,
it
said
that
the
public
interest
required
adjudication
of
these
issues.
and
the
public
interest
is
no
less
severe
in
that
case
than
it
is
here.
that
is,
this
is
a
military
commission
that
is
literally
unbounded
by
the
laws,
constitution,
and
treaties
of
the
united
states.
and
if
you
adopt
the
government's
position
here,
it
effectively
replicates
the
blank
check
that
this
court
rejected
in
hamdi.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia,
everything
is
different
about
this.
that
is,
in
your
posited
hypothetical,
there
is
some
law
that
you
know
will
govern
that
ultimate
question
about
disqualification
or
whatever
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--matter--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
do
think
that
there's
an
integral
relationship
to
the...
between
the
two.
that
is,
that
the
predicate
for
abstention
has
always
been
that
congress,
or
some
other
entity,
has
fairly
balanced
the
rights
of
both
sides.
here,
you
don't
have
that
fundamental
guarantee.
indeed,
if
you
adopt
the
government's
reading
here,
the...
they
have
said
that
they
want
to
try
75
military
commission
cases
or
so
in
the
first
wave.
you
will
then
be
left
with
75
trials
that
take
place
without
even
the
most
basic
question
of
what
the
parameters
are
that
these
commissions
are
to
operate
under.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
but--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
that's
precisely,
justice
scalia,
our
argument,
that
i
don't
think
one
can
consider
the
abstention
claim...
and
this
is
what
i
believe
both
courts
below
have
held...
you
can't
consider
the
abstention
claim
without
deciding
the
underlying
merits.
and
if
you
believe
that
the...
that
congress
has
fairly
balanced
the
rights
and
are
compliant
with
the
ucmj
and
the
like,
then
i
don't
think...
then
you're
reaching
the
merits,
and
there's
no
abstention
holding.
so,
if
i
could
turn
to
the
merits...
the
merits
challenges,
the
first
thing
i'd
like
to
discuss
on...
is
question
number
1
and
whether
this
military
commission
states
a
charge
that
violates
the
laws
of
war.
and
we
believe
it
doesn't,
for
two
essential
reasons.
first,
the
only
charge
in
this
case
is
one
of
conspiracy.
and
conspiracy
has
been
rejected
as
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war
for...
in
every
tribunal
to
consider
the
issue
since
world
war
ii.
it
has
been
rejected
in
nuremberg,
it's
been
rejected
in
the
tokyo
tribunals,
it's
been
rejected
in
the
international
tribunals
for
rwanda
and
yugoslavia,
and,
most
importantly,
it's
been
rejected
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
in
1997--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
charge
itself,
justice
stevens,
is
found
at
63(a)
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
sure.
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--ordinarily,
justice
kennedy,
the
answer
would
be
no,
you
wouldn't
challenge
the
validity
of
the
charge.
and,
indeed,
i
think
councilman
itself
is
a...
is
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
charge
at
issue,
and
the
question
was
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
reason
why
this
is
different,
however,
is
twofold.
first,
the
claim
that
mr.
hamdan
is
making
is
that
conspiracy
itself
falls
entirely
out
of
any
authorization
of
congress.
in
councilman,
the
question
was...
there
was
an
article,
article
134
of
the
ucmj,
which
was
a
criminal
statute,
and
it
had
been
interpreted
to
punish
drug
dealing.
and
in
the
case
the
court
said
where...
this
court
said,
"we
will
defer
as
to
whether
the
facts
showed
the
requisite
amount
of
drug
dealing
to
violate
the
uniform
code.
"
here,
by
contrast,
mr.
hamdan's
claim
is
that
the
conspiracy
charge
falls
entirely
outside
of
the
laws
of
war
as
a
whole.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
charge
itself
is
one
of
conspiracy.
joint
enterprise
is,
itself,
not
an
independent
charge
in
international
tribunals;
so
you
can
charge,
for
example,
murder.
and
your
theory,
in
an
international
tribunal,
of
how
you
get
to
murder
is
joint
criminal
enterprise.
but
you'd
have
to
charge
the
underlying
violation,
itself.
here--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--if
you--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
there's
two
different
reasons.
the
tribunal
is
not
authorized,
and
that
the
charge
doesn't
state
a
violation.
now,
even
if
we
assume
that
the
tribunal
is
authorized
and
that
all
of
its
microprocedures
are
authorized
under
the
act
of
congress,
this...
allowing
this
charge,
conspiracy,
is
to
open
the
floodgates
to
give
the
president
the
ability
to
charge
whatever
he
wants--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--in
a
military
commission.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
you
are--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely
correct,
justice--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--souter.
and,
indeed,
i
would
add
to
that
that
the
conspiracy
charge
here,
justice
kennedy,
is...
the
problem
with
it
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
the
tribunal
itself
is
charging
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war,
when
the
military
commission
has
never
operated
to
try
violations
of
terrorism
in
stateless,
territoryless
conflicts.
that
is,
it's
not
just
the
charge,
but
it's
where
the
charge
operates
that
we
find
so
central,
that
the...
that
there
are
two
different
things--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--there's
two
different
problems.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
they
may
be
amended,
yes.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
be--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
the...
justice
alito,
the
government
has
had,
essentially,
now
4
years
to
get
their
charges
together
on
mr.
hamdan.
at
this
point,
that...
you
know,
what
you
have
before
you
is
the
charge.
and
that...
and
they've
stuck
with
this
charge,
of
conspiracy,
which
is
not
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war.
and,
indeed,
the...
and
the...
it's
not
just
conspiracy
isn't,
but
that
the
commission
is
operating
in
totally
uncharted
waters,
because
it's
charging
a
violation
in
a
stateless,
territoryless
conflict,
something
as
to
which
the
full
laws
of
war
have
never
applied.
indeed,
justice
alito,
all
ten
people
facing
military
commissions
today,
all
ten
indictments
charge
conspiracy
right
now.
seven
only
charge
conspiracy.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
not
in...
not
here,
because,
as,
i
think,
both
courts
below
indicated,
this
case,
and
his
challenge,
falls
very
much
like
abney
versus
united
states.
this
is
a
challenge
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
underlying
tribunal
and
the
charge
that's
against
them.
indeed,
this
court,
in
quirin,
heard,
as
its
first
question,
does
the
charge
state
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war?
that
was
the
first
thing
it
said
had
to
be
asked.
so,
i
think
the...
what
we
are
doing
is
applying
nothing
more
than
the
settled
practice
that
has
always
been
the
case
with
respect
to
military
commissions.
and
it...
in...
the
public
interest
here,
again,
just
as
quirin,
i
think,
requires
some
limits
placed
on
military
commissions,
justice
alito,
because,
otherwise,
if
the
government's
position
is
taken
as
the
final
word,
it'll
give
the
president
the
ability
to
essentially
create
that
blank
check,
for
years
on
end,
render
a
final
decision
at
some
point,
and
then
that
final
decision
will
then
be
subject
to
the
truncated
review
procedures
in
the
dta,
which
i
don't
think
is
what
congress
intended
when
they
changed
the
language
of
the
bill.
rather,
i
think
what
they
did
was
intend
that
this
court
would
decide
the
basic...
apply
the
basic
structural
limits
on
military
commissions
that
have
always
applied.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
is
clear,
justice
stevens.
that
is...
that
is
precisely
what
the
international
tribunals
reject.
conspiracy
is
a
standalone
offense.
one
can
charge,
as
a
war
crime,
attacking
civilians
and
the
like,
as
a
pure
crime,
but
what
you
can't
do
is
charge
conspiracy.
and,
indeed,
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
in
1997,
when
they
wrote
the
war
crimes
act,
essentially
made
that
conclusion,
because
they
defined
"war
crimes"
with
incorporating
a
variety
of
treaties--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--if
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
kennedy,
on
this
particular
point,
on
conspiracy,
yes,
if...
that
you
couldn't
charge
some
other
offense,
like
aiding
and
abetting,
and
transmute
some
conspiracy
charge
into
that.
rather,
the
international
law
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
recognize
you
can
prosecute
him
for
aiding
and
abetting
as
a
violation
of
whatever
the
specific
underlying
crime
is,
like
murder
or
attacking
civilians.
what
you
can't
do
is
use
the
standalone
offense
of
conspiracy.
and
here's
why.
because
the
standalone
offense
of
conspiracy
is
rejected
by
international
law,
because
it's
too
vague.
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
test
for
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war
is
when
universal
agreement
and
practice
make
it
a
violation.
the
world
rejects
conspiracy,
because
if
it's
adopted
it
allows
so
many
individuals
to
get
swept
up
within
its
net.
justice
kennedy,
aiding
and
abetting
which
requires
a
much
closer
relationship
between
the
conduct
and
the
individual
offender.
conspiracy
does
not.
and
so,
for
example,
under
the
government's
theory,
a
little
old
lady
in
switzerland
who
donates
money
to
al
qaeda,
and
that
turns
out
to
be
a
front
for
terrorists
acts
and
so
on,
might
be
swept
up
within
this
broad
definition
of
conspiracy.
and
that's
why
international
law
has
so
rejected
the
concept
of
conspiracy.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
it
is
the
role
of
this
court
to
confine
the
tribunal
to
its
lawful
jurisdiction.
and
that's
what
this
court
held
in
quirin.
and
that's
what
we
think
you
should
do
here.
the
tribunal
itself
can't
be
the
judge
of
its
own
jurisdiction.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
again,
we
think,
at
this
point,
that
the
public
interest
is
best
served
by
this
court
saying
that
conspiracy
doesn't
violate...
to
set
some
limits.
after
all,
all...
everyone
facing
a
military
commission
is
facing
this
charge.
seven
are
only
facing
this
charge.
the
government
wants
to
put
75
of
these
cases
through.
and
it
has
taken
4
and
a
half
years
since
the
president's
military
order--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--for
this
case--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--if
the
charge
is
the
specific
offenses
themselves,
not
aiding
and
abetting,
justice
stevens--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--yes,
with
respect
to
this
particular
claim
about
conspiracy,
that
would
solve
that
problem.
if
you
say
the
charge
is
attacking
civilians,
and
your
theory
of
proving
it
is
aiding
and
abetting
the
murder
or
the
attacking
of
civilians--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--yes.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
would
mix
apples
and
oranges,
because
"conspiracy"
and
"aiding
and
abetting"
are
two
entirely
different
things.
one
is
a
standalone
offense.
and
the
one
is
a
theory
of
how
to
prove
a
violation--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it's
not,
justice
stevens,
because
it
requires
a
different
level
of
participation,
and
the
liability
is
entirely
different.
because
if
conspiracy
is
accepted,
you're
accepting
pinkerton
liability.
that's
what
the
government's
own
charge
said...
the
government's
own
instruction
said,
which
means
that
mr.
hamdan
is
liable
for
all
the
acts
of
9/11
and
everything
al
qaeda
has
done.
"aiding
and
abetting",
as
you
are
saying,
justice
stevens,
in
your
hypothetical,
is
a
much
more
closely
tethered
theory
of
liability,
requiring
a
higher
level
of
individual
culpability
and
a
totally
different
level
of
punishment.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
correct.
if
i
could
turn
to
a
second
argument
for
why
we
believe
this
military
commission
is
impermissible,
and
that
is
that
it
defies
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
in
article
36,
sets
minimal
ground
rules
for
military
justice,
writ
large.
and
it
says
that
the
president
can't
act
in
ways
that
are
contrary
to,
or
inconsistent
with,
this
chapter.
as
judge
robertson
found,
already
we
know
that
has
happened
here.
mr.
hamdan
has
been
kicked
out
of
his
criminal
trial
right
at
the
get.
and
the
government's
position
is
that
they
don't
have
to
abide
by
the
ucmj,
which
is
a
further
reason,
of
course,
why
we
believe
that
abstention
isn't
appropriate,
because
it
defies
the
rules
set
out
by
congress.
we're
asking
this
court
to
apply
the
minimal
rules
of
the
ucmj
to
the
military
commissions
that
operate
at
guantanamo
bay,
because
article
2
of
the
ucmj
has
been
extended,
and
its
protections
now
extend
to
guantanamo
bay
and
protect
those
who
are
detained
there.
and
one
of
its
protections
is
the
right
to
be
present,
and
that
has
been
fundamentally
violated
by...
already.
if
i
could--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--we
do.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
absolutely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia,
that's
what
the
government
would
like
you
to
believe.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
the
historical
relationship
has
been
that
military
commissions
in
courts
martial
follow
the
same
procedures.
that's
what
general
crowder
said
when
he
testified
in
1916,
and
what
this
court
has
quoted
from
his
testimony.
it's
what
every
military
treatise
says.
now,
to
be
clear,
our
position
is
not
that
military
commissions
must
follow
all
the
rules
for
courts
martial.
not
at
all.
they
must
require...
must
follow
the
minimal
baseline
rules
set
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
by
congress.
they
can
depart
from
the
panoply
of
rules,
the
867
pages
of
rules
in
the
manual
for
courts
martial,
so
long
as
they
don't
depart
from
the
ucmj
itself.
congress
has
answered
this
question,
justice
scalia,
in
article
36,
by
saying
the
president
does
have
a
wide
ability
to
depart
from
the
rules,
but
he
can't
depart
from
the
fundamentals
of
the
ucmj.
and,
indeed,
that's
what--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
we
do
believe
that
the...
that
the
entire
panoply
of
ucmj
protection--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--is
involved.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
there's
an
article
10
right
for
speedy
charges.
there
is
also
an
article
67
right
for
independent
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
review,
which
is
something
that
is
not
guaranteed
by
this
commission.
and
so...
and,
indeed,
was
a
predicate
for
this
court's
abstention
holding
in
councilman.
so,
we
do
believe
that
there
are...
that
these
fundamental
rights
apply.
and,
of
course,
this
is
just
all,
justice
kennedy,
default
rules.
if
the...
if
the
congress
wants
to
pass
a
law
to
exempt
military
commissions
from
article
36,
that...
they
are
free
to
do
so,
and
that
will
then
be...
that'll
then
be--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--a
simpler
case--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
we
had
them
before,
because...
we
had
them
before,
because
we
couldn't
find
military
court
martial
jurisdiction.
they
were
situations
of
absolute
necessity.
the
reason
was
that
the
articles
of
war,
for
one
reason
or
another,
didn't
cover
particular
individuals.
and,
therefore,
we
needed
to
craft
a
separate
procedure.
but,
whenever
we
did
so,
justice
breyer,
we
always
said
that
court
martial
rules
apply.
in
1847,
which
is
really
the
first
instance
of
a
military
commission,
because
general
washington
operated
under
statutory
charges
to
try
spying...
but
in
1847,
we
applied
court
martial
rules
by
general
order
number
1.
in
the
civil
war,
we
applied
general
order
number
1
again,
and
it
said
that
it
would...
that
we
needed
to
apply
to
court
martial...
court
martial
rules,
because,
otherwise,
abuses
would
arise.
and,
essentially,
the
worry
is
one
of
forum
shopping,
that
you
give
the
president
the
ability
to
pick
a
forum
and
define
the
rules.
and
that...
and
that
fundamentally
open
ended
authority
is
what
i
believe
this
court
rejected
in
hamdi,
and
it's...
and
when
it
rejected
the
blank
check.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
act
itself...
and
even...
i
know
this
isn't
relevant
for
you,
but
for
other
individuals
on
the
court...
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
or
even
the
post...
even
the
brief
filed
by
senators
graham
and
kyle,
which
suggest,
in
any
way,
that
this
was
ratification.
but
suppose
it
were,
justice
scalia.
suppose
it
did
ratify
some
sort
of
military
commission.
i
don't
believe
that
it
authorized
this
military
commission
with
this
charge,
conspiracy,
in
this
conflict,
a
stateless,
territoryless
conflict,
with
these
procedures,
procedures
that
violate
the
ucmj.
so,
it
may
be
that
they
authorized
something.
but
even
that,
i
think,
may
be
a
bit
hard,
because,
after
all,
what
they
did
was
authorize,
as
justice
alito
said,
certain
challenges
to
military
commissions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
they...
i
think
it's
perfectly...
well,
it's
a...
it's
a...
it
is
a
possible
reading
to
say
the
dta
authorized
some
sort
of
military
commission.
the
text
doesn't
say
so.
it
is,
of
course,
addressed
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
and
not
in
any
way
to
the...
to
the...
to
the...
to
the
underlying
merits.
i
do
think
that
the...
that
there
is
a...
you
know,
a
conceivable
argument.
however,
the
reason
why
i
think
this
court,
if
it
did
decide
to
reach
that
ultimate
question,
should
reach
it
against
the
government,
is
that
that
kind
of
back
door
kind
of...
you
know,
approval
by
inference
has
never
been
sufficient
when
it
comes
to
authorizing
military
jurisdiction,
in
the
most
awesome
powers
of
the
government,
to
dispense
life
imprisonment
and
death.
that
is,
i
think,
a
clearer
statement
would
be
required
in
this
unique
setting,
because
we
aren't
talking
about,
after
all,
minor
things.
we're
talking
about
the
most
grave
powers
of
our
government,
the
power
to
dispense
life
imprisonment
and
death.
and
i
certainly
don't
think
congress,
on
the
basis
of
a
few
hours
of
debate,
intended
to
ratify
this
entire
apparatus.
if
i
could
turn
to
question
2
and
the
geneva
conventions,
i'd
like
to
start
with
common
article
3
and
its
minimal
baseline
requirements
that
a
regularly
constituted
court
be
set
up,
and
one
that
dispense...
that
affords
the
rights
indispensable
to
civilized
peoples.
as
judge
williams
found,
below,
that
article
does
apply
to
mr.
hamdan,
and
protects
him.
it's
the
most
minimal
rudimentary
requirements
that
the
united
states
senate
adhered
to
when
it
ratified
the
convention
in
1955.
and
those
requirements--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
the
way
that
it
has
been
interpreted,
"regularly
constituted
court",
is
not
an
ad
hoc
court
with
ad
hoc
rules.
so,
that
is
to
say,
justice
scalia,
if
they
resuscitated--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--so
long
as
it
is,
(a)
independent
of
the
executive,
which
is
what
it's
been
interpreted
to
be,
and,
(b)
affords
the
rights
known
to
civilized
peoples.
and
here,
we
think
this
military
commission
strays
from
both
of
those...
from
both
of
those.
it's
not
independent
of
the
executive--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--so
far,
justice
ginsburg,
all
that
we
have
before...
you
know,
i
think
all
that's
happened
is
the
right
to
be
present.
to
look
to
what
other
rights
are
guaranteed
by
common
article
3,
you
can
look
to
additional
protocol
1
of
the
geneva
conventions,
which
specifies
rights
like
appeal
rights
and
the
like.
but
they're
the
most
minimal
baseline
rights.
we're
not
talking
about,
you
know,
miranda
rights
or
something
like
that.
we're
talking
about
just
a
set
of
core
ideas
that
every
country
on
the
world...
every
country
in
the
world
is
supposed
to
dispense
when
they
create
war
crimes
trials.
and,
even
that
minimal
standard,
the
government
says
they
don't
want
to
apply
here.
and
why
we
think
this
is
enforceable
is
that
mr.
hamdan
is
being
prosecuted
in
the
name
of
the
laws
of
war.
and
he
has
the
right
to
invoke
the
geneva
conventions
defensively
as
a...
as
a
way
to
constrain
the
tribunal,
to
say
that
they
can't--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--no,
justice
kennedy,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
csrt,
to
my
knowledge,
never
asked
any
of
those--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--questions
about--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--uniforms
or--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--we
would
love
a
beginning
point.
and
the
beginning
point
is
an
article
5
hearing,
which
is
required
by
army
regulation
190-8,
in
article
5
of
the
geneva
conventions.
the
csrt
in
no
way
suffices
to
do
that.
it
didn't
ask
those
questions
about,
are...
you
know,
uniforms,
and
the
like,
to
my
knowledge.
of
course,
the
csrt
isn't
in
the
record,
so
we
don't
really
know.
the
government
said,
below,
that
it
had,
quote,
"zero
effect
on
this
case",
and
didn't
introduce
it.
but,
be
that
as
it
may,
suppose
that
the
csrt
did
decide
that
mr.
hamdan
is
an
enemy
combatant.
justice
kennedy,
most
enemy
combatants
are
prisoners
of
war.
so,
if
anything,
all
the
csrt
did
was
affirm
mr.
hamdan's
separate
claim,
apart
from
common
article
3,
to
the
full
protection
of
the
geneva
conventions.
if
i--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--yes,
justice--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--souter.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
is
a
foundational
role
of
this
court,
as
justice
kennedy
says,
to
test
the
lawfulness
of
tribunals,
particularly
executive
detention.
and
in
the
pretrial
area,
that's
the
historic
role
of
this
court
from
bereford
to
quirin.
this
claim
is...
mr.
hamdan's
claim
is
primarily
a
jurisdictional
one,
as
both
courts
below
found
when
they
recognized
his
ability
to
bring
this
pretrial
challenge,
because
he
is
not
an
offender
under
the
laws
of
war
until
he
obtains
his
article
5
hearing,
because
the
charge
doesn't
state
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war,
which
is,
itself,
jurisdictional,
and
because
it
doesn't
follow
the
procedures
of
the
laws
of
war,
which
this
court,
in
yamashita,
in
pages
5,
and,
in
the
dissent,
at
page
72,
recognized
as
jurisdictional.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
now,
that
was--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--with
respect
to
conspiracy?
yes,
i
have.
and
i
do
believe
the
text
says
that
they're
referring
to
domestic
offenses.
it's
certainly
the
case
that
conspiracy
has
been
tried
as
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war
at
some
point
in
the
civil
war.
but
that
has
been
entirely
eclipsed
by
the
modern
laws
of
war,
which
have
rejected
it
everywhere.
and
if
you
adopt
the
government's
reading,
justice
stevens,
that
the
laws
of
war
are
frozen
into
time
in
1916,
then
i
believe
there
goes
the
government's
case
entirely,
because
the
thrust
of
the
government's
case
is
the
laws
of
war
have
to
adapt
to
this
stateless,
territoryless
organization
known
as
al
qaeda.
if
we're
playing
by
1916
rules,
there
is
no
way
that
this
commission
would
have
been
accepted
in
1916.
now,
all
of
those
jurisdictional
pretrial
challenges
were
accepted
by
the
courts
below
when
the
full
panoply
of
dta
rights...
when
the
full
panoply
of
rights
existed.
now
the
dta
certainly
circumscribes
the
scope.
we
don't
know
whether
question
1
very
clearly
is
able
to
be
raised
after
the
dta's
enactment.
we
certainly...
question
2,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said,
is
not
raisable.
we
don't
know
when
it
can
be
raised,
because
the
president
can
block
final
review
for
all
time
under
the
dta.
he
has
the
keys
to
the
federal
courthouse.
and
if
you
defer
to
this
system
and
give
the
president
the
ability
to
launch
all
of
these
tribunals
for
75
individuals
with
these
charges,
with
these
procedures,
you
will
be
countenancing
a
huge
expansion
of
military
jurisdiction.
conspiracy
is
one
of
the
few
offenses,
justices,
that
has
now
been
rejected
by
the
laws
of
war
internationally
in
tribunal
after
tribunal.
it's
certainly
never
been
approved
by
a
federal
court.
and,
indeed,
it
has
been
rejected.
in
colepaugh,
for
example,
no
challenge
to
conspiracy
was
raised.
the
government's
argument,
in
the
end,
it
seems
to
me,
is
one
that
this
court
rejected
in
levin,
because
it
depends,
as
its
predicate,
on
the
idea
that
the
president
has
ultimate
flexibility
with
respect
to
these
military
commissions,
except
for
the
nine
provisions
in
the
ucmj
which
govern
translators
and
deposition
testimony.
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
ucmj,
when
enacted,
intended
to
regulate
military
commissions
with
only
that
bare
bones
to
it.
indeed,
general
crowder
said,
"military
commissions
and
courts
martial
follow
the
same
procedures.
"
finally,
justices,
we'd
just
point
out
that
the
predicate
of
abstention
is
not
met
here.
this
is
not
a
ordinary
criminal
trial
applying
lawful
ordinary
procedures.
this
is
an
ad
hoc
trial
in
which
the
procedures
are
all
defined
with
the
president.
he
says
the
laws
of
war
do
not
apply
when
we're
talking
about
protecting
this
vulnerable
individual
at
guantanamo.
but
then
he
says
they
do
apply
and
permit
him
to
charge
mr.
hamdan
with
the
one
offense
which
is
rejected
entirely
at
international
law.
it
was
a
great
american
patriot,
thomas
paine,
who
warned,
"he
who...
that
would
make
his
own
liberty
secure
must
guard
even
his
enemy
from
oppression,
for
if
he
violates
that
duty,
he
establishes
a
precedent
that
will
reach
unto
himself.
"
that's
what
we're
asking
you
to
do
here,
just
enforce
the
lawful
uses
of
military
commissions
and
the
historic
role
of
this
court.
thank
you.
