justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
mean,
in
practical
terms,
that
the...
that
the...
that
the
other
claims
that
are
in
the
district
court
get
transferred
to
the
circuit,
the
circuit
is
bound
by
the
limitations
that
you've
just
described,
and,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
complaining
parties
in
those
cases
can
raise
the
question
whether
they...
whether
congress
could
properly
have
truncated
them,
as
it
did,
but
it's
simply
got
to
wait?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
katyal,
i
mean,
that's
a
good
argument
for...
from
a
broad
policy,
but
isn't
there
a
narrower
reason?
if
we
assume
that
the...
that
the
commission
is
properly
established
for
some
purpose,
by
definition
that
purpose
is
limited.
we
are
not
dealing
here,
as
we
would
in
the
normal
criminal
case,
with
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
if
we're
dealing
with
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
we
postpone
claims
like
yours
til
the
end,
because
we
say
the
jurisdiction
is
so
broad,
they
probably
had
it.
maybe
not,
but
we
can
wait.
but
in
a...
in
a...
in
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction,
or
a
commission
of
limited
jurisdiction,
we
can't
indulge
that
presumption.
and
that's
why,
i
thought,
your
claim
that
conspiracy
is
not
cognizable
can
be
raised
at
the
beginning,
because
it's
inseparable
from
the
limited
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
am
i
off
in
left
field?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
do
you
like
that
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
would
require
a
determination
by
a
different
tribunal
that
he
was
not
a
pow,
in
default
of
which
he
would
be
treated
as
a
pow
and
be
entitled
to
a
court
martial?
is
that
the
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you...
what
do
you
make
of
the
argument
that
mr.
katyal
just
alluded
to,
that
if
you
take
the...
as
you
do...
take
the
position
that
the
commissions
are
operating
under
the
laws
of
war,
you've
got
to
accept
that
one
law
of
war
here
is
the
geneva
convention
right
to
a
presumption
of
pow
status
unless
there
is
a
determination
by
a
competent
tribunal
otherwise,
with
the...
among
other
things,
the
rights
that
that
carries.
i
mean,
how...
do
you...
why
not...
why
don't
you
go
from
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire,
in
effect,
when
you
take
the
position
that
the
laws
of
war
are
what
the
tribunal
is
applying?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
you're...
are
you
saying
that
the...
that
the
commission
will
adjudicate
pow
status
under
the
geneva
convention?
in
other
words,
are
you
stipulating
that
the
geneva
convention
does
apply,
so
that
the
only
argument
left
between
you
and
mr.
katyal
would
be
whether
the
commission
itself
was
a
competent
tribunal
to
make
the
determination?
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
agree
that
it
applies
as
part
of
the
law
of
war?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that,
i
guess,
is
the
problem
that
i'm
having.
for
purposes
of
determining
the
domestic
authority
to
set
up
a
commission,
you
say,
the
president
is
operating
under
the
laws
of
war
recognized
by
congress,
but
for
purposes
of
a
claim
to
status,
and,
hence,
the
procedural
rights
that
go
with
that
status,
you're
saying
the
laws
of
war
don't
apply.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
is
entitled
to
make
a
claim
under
them
to
determine
whether,
on
the
merits,
he
is
entitled.
isn't
that
entailed
by
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
exclusive
review
of
what?
i
don't
see
that
the...
that
the...
that
the
dta
preserves
a
right
to
review
of
the
very
issue
that
they
want
to
raise
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
can...
they
can...
they
can
review
their
enemy
combatant
determination.
they
can
review
the
consistency
of
the
procedure
of
the
court
with
whatever
law
applies.
but
i
don't
see
that
there
is
a
clear
reservation
of
right
to
get
to
the
very
basic
question
of
the...
of
the
constitution
of
the
court
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you're
reading--
justice
david
h.
souter
--procedures--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
encompass
the
very
act
constituting
the
court
itself?
is
that
the
government's...
i
mean,
are
you
going
to
go
on
the
record--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
whole
point,
it
seems
to
me,
of
the
argument,
is,
should
we
not
consider
the
significance
of
those
very
questions,
because,
if
we
don't,
as
justice
breyer
said,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
as
you
describe
it,
we
will
have
to
face
the
serious
constitutional
question
of
whether
congress
can,
in
fact,
limit
jurisdiction
without
suspending
habeas
corpus?
the
whole
point
is
to
grapple
with
them
now,
and
to...
and
to
treat
them
in
a
way
that
allows
for
this
adjudication,
so
that
we
avoid
this
constitutional
difficulty
tomorrow.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
may
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
question.
that's
what...
that's
what
constitutional
avoidance
hopes
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
there
a
pretty
good
argument
that
a
suspension
of
the
writ
of
congress
is
just
about
the
most
stupendously
significant
act
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
can
take?
and,
therefore,
we
ought
to
be
at
least
a
little
slow
to
accept
your
argument
that
it
can
be
done
from
pure
inadvertence?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
have
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--get
to
the
issue,
in
accordance
with
justice
breyer's
question,
whether
or
not
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
suspended,
you
are
leaving
us
with
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
congress
may
validly
suspend
it
inadvertently.
is
that
really
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
writ
is
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
writ
is
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--now,
wait
a
minute.
the
writ
is
the
writ.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
are
not
two
writs
of
habeas
corpus
for
some
cases
and
for
other
cases.
the
rights
that...
the
rights
that
may
be
asserted,
the
rights
that
may
be
vindicated,
will
vary
with
the
circumstances,
but
jurisdiction
over
habeas
corpus
is
jurisdiction
over
habeas
corpus.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
position
you
have
taken
is
that
if,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
have
to
reach
the
question
that
justice
breyer
described,
the
answer
to
that
question
may
be,
"yes,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
suspended
by
inadvertence.
"
"congress
did
not
intend
to
do
it.
"
is
that
really
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
also
your
point
when
there
is
no
insurrection
or
invasion?
justice
david
h.
souter
perhaps
that's
something
that
a
court
ought
to
inquire
into
when
it
gets
into
the
question
of
congressional
intent.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
specific--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
intent--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
how
specific
that
intent
must
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let's
assume
we
do
not
have
a
magic
words
requirement.
given
the
significance
of
suspending
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
should
we
not
have
a
pretty
clear
statement
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
may
be
nothing--
justice
david
h.
souter
--subtle
about
the
statute,
but
there
is
something
very
silent
about
the
statute
as
to
whether
congress
understood
that
it
was...
that
it
was
acting
under
its
authority
to
suspend
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
and,
at
the
very
least,
that
unclarity
is
manifested
by
the
effective
date
provision.
h(1)
doesn't
have
the
language
that
it
had
before
the
amendment.
therefore,
it
seems
to
me,
there
would
be
some
difficulty,
if
we
have
to
get
to
the
question,
in
finding
a
clear
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
suspend
the
writ
under
its
article
i
power.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
comes--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
comes
as
a
wolf
under
h(2),
but
the
wolf
is
silent
under
h(1),
and
the
wolf
used
to
speak
under
h(1),
and
it
had
its
teeth
taken
out.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--gone.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
very
fact--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
congress
chose
to
remove
the
clarity
of
the
prior
provision
is
of
no
significance?
justice
david
h.
souter
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--whatever
may
be
the
standard
of
due
care
for
courts
in
reviewing
acts
of
congress
with
respect
to
attorneys
fees,
it
doesn't
reach
the
level
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
incumbent
on
us
when
we're
talking
about
suspending
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
justice
david
h.
souter
can--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
