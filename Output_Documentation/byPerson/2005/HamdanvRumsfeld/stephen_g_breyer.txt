but
if
you
have
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--approximately
the
same
procedures,
what's
the
point
of
having
a
military
commission?
i
think
that
was
implicit
in
justice
scalia's
question.
so,
if
you
go
back...
revolution,
seminoles,
modoc,
mexican
war,
world
war
ii...
why
have
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
hard
for
me
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--see
that
with
the
language
of
this,
because
the
language
that
you're
talking
about
refers
to
"such
standards".
(a).
that
military
order
is
an
order
of
august
31st
which
talks
about
procedures.
it's
not
the
order
that
sets
up
the
commission,
which
is
an
order
issued
the
preceding
november.
rather,
this
language
seems
to
mean
what
it
says.
but
even
if
it
didn't...
even
if
it
didn't,
wouldn't
your
reading
raise
a
terrifically
difficult
constitutional
question,
if
not
this
case,
in
cases
that
are
pending
right
now,
where
prisoners
in
guantanamo
are
claiming
that
they
have
not
yet
had
the
csrt
hearing,
they're
claiming,
one
or
two,
"we
had
it,
and
we're
still
here.
"
"we
won,
but
we're
still
here.
"
they're
claiming,
"we
don't
want
to
be
sent
back
to
qatar.
"
and
they're
claiming,
some,
that
they
were
tortured.
all
right?
now,
if
we
could
avoid
the
case
with
your
interpretation
here,
and
avoid
that
constitutional
question...
we
can't
avoid
it.
so,
my
question
is,
one,
how
is
what
you're
arguing
consistent
with
the
language
i
quoted?
and,
two,
how
could
it,
if
we
accepted
your
interpretation,
possibly
avoid
the
most
terribly
difficult
and
important
constitutional
question
of
whether
congress
can
constitutionally
deprive
this
court
of
jurisdiction
in
habeas
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
still
don't
see
the
answer
to
my
question,
which
had
two
parts.
as
to
the
language,
(a)
which
is
what's
cross
referenced,
refers
to
military
commission
order
number
1,
august
31,
2005,
or
any
successor
military
order.
the
order,
as
i
understand
it,
that's
created
the
commission
by
the
president,
is
an
order
which
was
november
13,
2001,
not
a
successor
to
2005.
but
leaving
the
language
aside,
what
i'm
mostly
interested
in,
because
i
think
your
interpretation
inevitably
creates
it,
is,
what
is
the
answer
to
the
claim
that
it
is
not
constitutional
for
congress,
without
suspending
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
to
accomplish
the
same
result
by
removing
jurisdiction
from
the
courts
in
a
significant
number
of
cases,
even
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
listed
four
sets
of
cases
that
i
don't
see
how
you
could
possibly
shoehorn
into
e(2)
and
e(3),
even
if
you
are
able
to
shoehorn
this
one.
and
my
language
was
designed
to
make
you
see
how
difficult
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
listed
four
that
i
don't
see
how
anybody
could
shoehorn
into
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
the
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
other
side...
if
you
want
the
argument,
the
other
side
is,
there
are
several
hundred
cases
already
pending.
and,
therefore,
if
we
accept
your
interpretation,
we
know
we
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
argument.
if
we
reject
your
interpretation,
since
all
these
cases,
several
hundred
of
them,
are
already
there,
it
might
be,
new
ones
won't
be
brought.
but,
of
course,
"new
ones
won't"
might.
and,
therefore,
what
is
your
answer
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
question
that
this
is
unconstitutional...
if
not
here,
in
other
places?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
put
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
issue
in...
don't...
ignore
my
question,
which
is
the
same
as
justice
kennedy's,
if
it
doesn't
help.
i'm
trying
to
focus
this.
and,
in
my
mind,
i
take
their
argument
as
saying,
"look,
you
want
to
try
a
war
crime.
"
"you
want
to
say
this
is
a
war
crimes
tribunal.
"
"one,
this
is
not
a
war,
at
least
not
an
ordinary
war.
"
"two,
it's
not
a
war
crime,
because
that
doesn't
fall
under
international
law.
"
"and,
three,
it's
not
a
war
crime
tribunal
or
commission,
because
no
emergency,
not
on
the
battlefield,
civil
courts
are
open,
there
is
no
military
commander
asking
for
it,
it's
not
in
any
of
those
in
other
respects,
like
past
history.
"
"and
if
the
president
can
do
this,
well,
then
he
can
set
up
commissions
to
go
to
toledo,
and,
in
toledo,
pick
up
an
alien,
and
not
have
any
trial
at
all,
except
before
that
special
commission.
"
now,
i've
tried
to
summarize
a
whole
bunch
of
points
for
you
to
get
at,
as
you
wish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it...
does
it...
does
it
define
the
contours,
along
with
other
relevant
international
sources,
of
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
words
"laws
of
war".
he's
being
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war
in
both
statutes,
like...
what
is
it
+/?
2240...
2441,
in
quirin.
to
get
the
meaning
of
that
term,
the
courts
looked
to
other
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
president,
and
not
congress,
defining
the
content
of
the
law,
the
criminal
law,
under
which
a
person
will
be
tried?
isn't
there
a
"separation
of
powers"
problem
there?
