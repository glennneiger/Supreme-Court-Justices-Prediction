but
isn't
that--
justice

--why
does
it...
why
does
it
affect
the
scope
of
the
review
that
he
could
get
eventually?
if
there's
a
final
decision,
there
can
be
review
of
whether
the
use
of
the
standards
or
procedures
that
were
used
by
the
commission
to
reach
a
final
decision
is
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states?
why
doesn't
that
encompass
any
claim
that
he
might
want
to
make
later
on?
justice

i
mean,
criminal
litigation
review
after
the
final
decision
is
the
general
rule.
there
generally
is
not
any
interlocutory...
any
interlocutory
appeal.
and
what
you
say
could
happen
in
any
criminal
case
if
you
assume
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
are
responsible
for
making
the
decisions
along
the
way.
they
could
delay
indefinitely
and
postpone
the
entry
of
a
final
decision.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
is
it
clear
that
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--charges
against
your
client
could
not
be
amended?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
why
should
we...
why
should
there
be
review,
before
trial,
of
a
charge
that
could
be
amended?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
could
be
additional
charges
added
by
the
time
there's
a
final
decision.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
this
contrary
to
the
way
legal
proceedings
and
appeals
are
normally
handled?
you
have
a...
essentially,
a
pretrial
appeal
concerning
the
validity
of
the
charge
that
may
not
even
be
the
final
charge.
justice

wouldn't
