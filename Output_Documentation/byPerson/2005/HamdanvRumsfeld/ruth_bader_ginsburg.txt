justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what,
in
addition
to
this
case...
i
mean,
this
case
is
pending
in
the
u.s.
supreme
court.
there
are
many
cases
pending
in
the
district
court
when
this
law
comes
into
effect.
what
about
those
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
mentioned...
you've
mentioned
that
the
defendant
has
no
right
to
appear
before
the
tribunal.
what
are
the
other
rights
recognized
by
all
civilized
people
that
these
tribunals
do
not
guarantee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
clement,
if
you
can
straighten
me
out
on
the
piece
that
you
read
about
"consistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
"
i
thought
that
it
was
the
government's
position
that
these
enemy
combatants
do
not
have
any
rights
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
how
will
the
question,
whether
the
laws
in
the
united...
and
constitution...
of
the
united
states,
whether
these
petitioners
have
any
claim
to
state
under
the
laws
and
constitution
of
the
united
states?
because
as
i
read...
the
review
that's
provided
doesn't
open
up
that
question.
it's
a
very
narrow
review
that's
given
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there...
is
there
any
review
in
this
court,
following
the
d.c.
circuit,
either
the
original
classification
or
the
conviction...
is
there...
does
this
court
have
any
part
in
the
scheme?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
clarity
with
which
congress
spoke?
this
law
was
proposed
and
enacted
some
weeks
after
this
court
granted
cert
in
this
very
case.
it
is
an
extraordinary
act,
i
think,
to
withdraw
jurisdiction
from
this
court
in
a
pending
case.
congress
didn't
say,
explicitly,
it
was
doing
that.
it
hasn't
done
it,
as
far
as
i
know,
since
mcardle.
but
there
congress
said,
"we
are
withdrawing
jurisdiction
in
this
very
case.
"
they
didn't
say
that
here.
so,
why
should
we
assume
that
congress
withdraw
our
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
case
once
the
case
was
already
lodged
here?
