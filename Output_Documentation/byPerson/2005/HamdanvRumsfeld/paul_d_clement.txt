mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
executive
branch
has
long
exercised
the
authority
to
try
enemy
combatants
by
military
commissions.
that
authority
was
part
and
parcel
of
george
washington's
authority
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
revolutionary
forces,
as
dramatically
illustrated
by
the
case
of
major
andre.
and
that
authority
was
incorporated
into
the
constitution.
congress
has
repeatedly
recognized
and
sanctioned
that
authority.
indeed,
each
time
congress
has
extended
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
martials,
congress
was
at
pains
to
emphasize
that
that
extension
did
not
come
in
derogation
of
the
jurisdiction
of
military
commissions.
and
in
its
most
recent
action,
congress
clearly
did
not
operate
as
somebody
who
viewed
the
military
commissions
as
ultra
vires.
they
offered
no
immediate
review,
and
no
review
at
all
for
charges
resulting
in
a
conviction
of
less
than
10
years.
of
course,
even
more
clearly,
congress's
most
recent
action
made
it
clear
that
the
courts
no
longer
have
jurisdiction
over
preenforcement
challenges.
and
it's
to
that
i'd
like
to
turn
first.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
what
i
would
say,
justice
stevens,
is,
they
basically
enforce
the
laws
of
war.
at
times,
there
are
obviously
united
states
sources
that
are
relevant
to
that.
obviously,
if
you
have
a
field
manual
or
something
that
says
specifically
that
certain
offenses
are
triable
under
the
law
of
war,
that
would
be
very
instructive
in
the
tribunals.
in
certain
situations
that
i
don't
think
are
principally
relevant
here,
you
might
also
have
war
courts
that
were
set
up
to
deal
with
municipal
offenses.
but
that's
not
what
we
have.
and
then,
they
would
look
to
u.s.
law.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
is
right.
and,
of
course,
in
this
context,
you
have
a
controlling
executive
act
in
the
form
of
the
regulations
themselves
that
make
it
clear
that
the
executive
views
things
like
conspiracy
to
violate
the
laws
of
war
to
be
actionable
under
the
laws
of
war.
now--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
if
you
did
that,
justice
stevens,
it
would
present
the
very
difficult
question
that
this
court
has
never
squarely
addressed,
which
is,
does
the
president
have
some
authority
to
try,
by
military
commission,
beyond
that
which
congress
has
joined
him
in?
obviously,
article
21
of
the
ucmj
gives
congress's
sanction
to
any
military
commissions,
to
the
extent
they
try
crimes
that
are
triable
by
the
law
of
war.
so,
in
that
sense,
i
think,
as
long
as
this
court
construes
consistent
with
over
100
years
of
united
states
tradition
and
history,
the
conspiracy
to
commit
a
law...
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war
is
a
war
crime,
then
you
don't
have
to
reach
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--difficult
issue.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
he--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
we
would
take
the
position
that
he
could,
as
a
matter
of
pure
constitutional
power.
i
don't
think,
though...
he
is
not
active
in
this
case
on
the
theory
that
conspiracy
is
outside
of
the
laws
of
war.
he's
acted
inconsistent
with
150
years
of
tradition.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes.
i
mean,
in
the
sense
that
i
think
that
if
there
were...
there...
the
other
side
is
certainly
able
to
argue,
before
the
military
commissions,
that
certain
procedural
provisions
or
the
like
are
prohibited
by
the
law
of
war
or
give
them
some
greater
entitlement.
now,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
like
madsen,
i
don't
think
that
the
law
of
war
is...
you
know,
extensively
regulates
procedure.
and,
indeed,
as
the
madsen
court
recognized,
congress's
approach
to
military
commissions
has
been
radically
different
than
its
approach
to
court
martials.
in
court
martials,
they
regulate
every
jot
and
tittle
of
the
procedure.
and
if
the
ucmj
and
its
provisions
for
court
martials
applies,
then
the
defendants
are
going
to
get
not
just
miranda,
but
miranda
plus,
and
a
whole
panoply
of
rights.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
follows
the
precedents
in
madsen,
it
will
recognize
that
only
those
nine
provisions
of
the
ucmj
that
expressly
reference
military
commissions
will
apply,
and
the
rest
is
left
to
a
much
more
common
law,
war
court
approach,
where
there's
much
greater
flexibility.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
there's
any
frying
pan
effect
or
fire
effect,
precisely
because
what
you
have
with
respect
to
the
claim
that
the
geneva
conventions
applies...
okay,
that
claim
could
be
brought
to
the
military
commissions,
but
they
could
adjudicate
it
and
say
that
the
geneva
conventions
don't
apply
here,
for
any
number
of
reasons.
and
i
think
that
this
idea
that
there
needs
to
be
an
article
5
proceeding--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter.
i
mean,
i
think
the
disagreement
is
more
fundamental
than
that.
what
i
would
say
is,
a
claim
could
be
brought
in
the
tribunal
that
the
geneva
conventions
apply.
now,
just
because
the
geneva
convention
does
apply--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
think,
consistent
with
the
position
of
the
executive,
that
the
geneva
convention
applies
in
this
particular
conflict.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we're
not
trying
to
have
it
both
ways,
justice
souter.
the
fact
that
the
geneva
conventions
are
part
of
the
law
of
war
doesn't
mean
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
any
protection
under
those
conventions.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
but
let
me
just
say
that
that's
a
claim
that
he
could
have
brought
before
the
csrts,
and
that
is
a
claim
he
can
still
bring
before
the
military
commissions.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
lawful--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and
we
disagree
with
those
claims.
we
think
that
most
of
those
claims...
to
the
extent
that
he
thinks
some
procedural
requirement
is
provided
either
by
the
geneva
convention,
if
applicable...
but
we
don't
think
it
would
be...
and
that
argument
would
be
made;
but,
if
by
some
other,
sort
of,
principle
of
the
law
or
that
a
procedure
is
required--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--he
could...
he
could
make
that
argument.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
again,
i
think
he
could...
he
could
bring
that
claim.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
well
taken
by
the...
by
the
commission.
i
don't
think
it's
a
valid
claim.
i
also
don't
think,
if...
there's
any
reason
why
that
claim
has
to
be
brought
at
this
stage
in
the
procedure.
we
think
that
abstention--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--principles--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
of
course
that's
true.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--also--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
and
this
court
made
clear
that
it
doesn't
intervene--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--even
when
a
u.s.--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
justice
kennedy,
this
isn't
a
"group
of
people".
this
is
the
president
invoking
an
authority
that
he's
exercised
in
virtually
every
war
that
we've
had.
it's
something
that
was
recognized
in
the
civil
war,
something
in
the
world
war
ii
that
this
court
approved.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
but...
habeas
corpus
generally
doesn't
give
a
right
to
a
pre
enforcement
challenge.
and
this
court,
for
example,
in
schlesinger
against
councilman--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
and
congress
has
spoken
to
this
precise
issue
in
the
dta.
whatever
was
the
question
about
applying--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--judge
made--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean,
i
don't
really
think
there's
any
serious
dispute
about
which
it
is.
i
mean,
this
is
something
that
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well...
and
if
this
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
even
if
a
court
might
have
had
jurisdiction
to
hear
just
that
issue
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--nothing
else
before
the
dta,
congress
has
now
spoken,
and
congress
has
made
it
clear
that,
whatever
else
is
true,
these
military
commission
proceedings
can
proceed,
and
exclusive
review
can
be
done
after
the
fact,
after
conviction,
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
i
disagree,
at
least--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--oh,
i
disagree,
justice
souter.
e(3)
specifically
preserves
the
claim
that
the
commissions
were
not,
and
the
procedures
were
not,
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
the
extent--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they're
pledgeable.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure,
if
they
want
to
come
in
and
argue
that
there
is
a
violation
of
article
21
of
the
ucmj,
or
article
36
of
the
ucmj,
after
their
conviction,
they
are
perfectly
free
to
do
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--under
e(3),
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
answer
both
pieces
of
that.
i
certainly
think
that
such
standards
and
procedures
to
reach
the
final
decision
are
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
there
is
a
reference
to
the
first
military
order.
i
believe
there's
also
a
reference
to
any
other
subsequent
orders
implementing
that.
all
of
that,
together,
implements
the
november
13th
order.
so,
i
would
think
that
there
is...
it
is
very
easy
to
read
this
language
to
allow
any
challenge
that
is
being
brought
here,
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
treaty
challenge.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
the
language
is
capacious
enough
if
the
treaty
challenge
is
what
you
thought
was
very
important,
the
d.c.
circuit,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
could
decide
whether
or
not
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
treaty
challenge
be
brought.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
and
congress,
in
this
act,
was
very
careful
to
basically
write
without
prejudice
to
the
answer
to
that
question.
so,
we
would
have
that
argument.
the
other
side
would
have
their
argument.
what
this
act
provides
that
we
don't
have
any
argument
on,
that
was
something
that
wasn't
before
this
court,
say,
in
the
rasul
decision,
was
the
fact
that
the
procedures
that
the
military
has
promulgated
are
going
to
be
enforceable
under
this
exclusive
review
provision.
so,
there
at
least
will
be
some
law
to
apply
now
under
this
exclusive
review
provision.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
so,
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
certainly
think
that
petitioner
will
be
up
there
arguing
that
eisentrager
is
no
longer
good
law,
not
just
as
a
statutory
matter,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
and
those
arguments
will
be
made.
without
respect
to
that,
certainly
the
arguments
about
article
21
and
article
36,
that
are
very
much
at
the
centerpiece
of
their
argument
here
today,
would
also
be
available
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
and
if
there's
some
constitutional
requirement
that
that
review
be
slightly
broader
or
slightly
narrower,
that
seems
like
something
that
can
better
be
adjudicated
in
the
context
of
a
concrete
case
at
the
point
that
that
review
is
sought.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
one
thing
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
there
would
be
1254
review.
once
the
provision
is
in
the
court
of
appeals,
then
the
case
would
be
under...
under
e(3),
the
review
provision...
then
the
case
would
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
purposes
of
this
court's
1254
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
answer
that
question
in
two
parts,
which
is
to
say
that
i
think
that
this
case,
and
most
of
the
cases,
don't
raise
a
serious
suspension
clause
problem,
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
think
deferring
review
or
channeling
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
amount
to
a
suspension.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but,
with
respect,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
cuts
both
ways,
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
particular
interpretation
of
these
provisions
on
the
table
before
this
court
that's
going
to
eliminate
those
potential
suspension
clause
issues.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
souter,
first
of
all,
i
would
think
general
principles
of
constitutional
avoidance
would
say
deferring
the
constitutional
question
is
a
good
thing,
not
a
bad
thing.
the
one
point
i
would--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
but
i
don't
see
any
argument
on
the
other
side
that's
really
a
constitutional
avoidance
argument.
their
principal
argument
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--don't
apply
this--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and,
justice
breyer,
what
i
would
say
is
that
our
interpretation
basically
provides
for
pending
claims
exactly
the
way
that
congress
did.
with
respect
to
any
future
claims
that
might
be
brought,
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
constitutional
question.
and
if
i
could
turn
to
our
interpretation
of
the
dta,
it's
the
only
one
that
really,
i
think,
reads
the
various
provisions
in
the
statute
in
harmony.
now,
this
court's
decision
in
bruner,
and
in
a
host
of
other
cases,
says
that
when
congress
eliminates
jurisdiction,
pending
cases
fall,
unless
there's
a
savings
clause.
the
closest
thing
to
a
savings
clause
in
the
statute,
in
e(1),
is
the
provision
that
says
1005>
["].
and
i
think
that's
important,
because
if
congress
wanted
to
put
in
a
savings
clause
of
the
kind
that
this
court
seems
to
refer
to
in
bruner,
and
that
would
certainly
be
consistent
with
senator
levin's
intent,
it
would
have
been
very
easy.
instead
of
saying
1005>
["],
they
could
have
said
"except
for
pending
cases".
the
choice
is
important,
because
what
does
section
1005
provide?
it
provides
the
exclusive
review
in
e(2)
and
e(3).
and
then,
h(2),
in
very
complementary
fashion,
says
that,
just
in
case
there's
any
question
about
it,
those
provisions
on
e(2)
and
e(3)
apply
to
pending
claims
governed
by
those
sections.
i
think
every
word's
important.
it
doesn't
say
"pending
cases",
it
says
"pending
claims".
congress
understood
two
important
things.
there
were
no
cases
currently
pending
under
e(2)
and
e(3),
because
congress
was
creating
e(2)
and
e(3).
it
also
knew
that
most
of
the
cases
before
the
d.c.
courts
had
some
claims
that
were
pure
challenges
to
the
final
ccert
determination
and
other
claims.
so,
what
h(2)
says
is...
h(2)
says
that,
to
the
extent
those
cases
involve
claims
governed
by
e(2)
and
e(3),
they
are
preserved
under
e(2)
and
e(3);
otherwise,
this...
there's
no
savings
clause
that
covers
those
claims,
and
their
jurisdiction
is
removed.
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--retroactivity
aspect...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
both,
ultimately.
i
mean,
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i...
i
don't
see
why
i
can't
have
alternative
arguments
here,
as
for
anywhere
else,
justice
stevens.
we
think
that
congress,
in
this
action,
did
not
do
anything
that
triggers
the
suspension
of
the
writ.
but
if
you
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
did,
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
the
terms
of
the
suspension
clause
would
be
satisfied
here
because
of
the
exigencies
of
9/11.
if
the
question
is,
am
i
taking
the
position
that
congress
consciously
thought
that
it
was
suspending
the
writ?
then
i
would
say
no.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
if
you
think,
in
order
for
there
be
to
a...
to
be
a
valid
suspension,
congress
has
to
do
it
consciously,
then
i
think
you
could
see
why
the
arguments
are
mutually
exclusive.
my
view
would
be
that
if
congress,
sort
of,
stumbles
upon
a
suspension
of
the
writ,
but
the
preconditions
are
satisfied,
that
would
still
be
constitutionally
valid.
so,
i
think
that
may
be
the
disagreement.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
a
couple
of
things,
justice
souter.
i
would
agree
with
you
if
what
we
were
talking
about
is
suspending
the
right
as
to
citizens
within
the
continental
united
states,
but
all
congress
did
here
is
restore
the
law
to
the
understanding
of
the
law
that
had
prevailed
for
200
years.
now,
this
court
obviously
took
a
different
view--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
rasul.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
at
least
if
you're
talking
about
the
extension
of
the
writ
to
enemy
combatants--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--held
outside--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
territory
of
the
united
states--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--okay.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
souter.
there's
no...
my
point
is
not
inadvertence.
it's
whether
they
have
to
say
or
incant
any
magic
words
that
they
are
now
invoking
the
power--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
suspend
the
writ.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
is
my
point.
and
there's
nothing
inadvertent
here--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
then
any
effort
to
suspend
the
writ
would
be
invalid.
but
this
is
not
a
case
where
there's
any
question
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
guess
my
point
would--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
i
disagree
with
that.
but
there's
two
separate
points
here,
is
that...
one
is,
does
congress
have
to
say,
"we
are
now
suspending
the
writ
under
our
suspension
clause?
"
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
call
to
say
that
they
have
to
do
that.
obviously,
in
cases
like
st.
cyr,
this
court
has
been
very
clear
to
say,
"congress
obviously
can't
stumble
upon
the
habeas
clause.
"
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
that's
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--at
issue
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes.
and
there's
no
question
that
congress,
here,
tried
to
amend
the
habeas
statute.
this
is
not
like
st.
cyr,
where
they
didn't
go
after
2241
in
terms.
there's
nothing
subtle
about
this
statute
with
respect
to
the
clarity
with
which
it
speaks--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
the
habeas
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
making
a
retroactivity
analysis
or
holding
here
is
going
to
spare
you
the
trouble
of
dealing
with
the
suspension
clause
argument.
i
mean,
in
st.
cyr,
it's
worth
noting
that
this
court
addressed
the
specificity
with
which
the
statute
applied
separately
from
the
retroactivity
question.
here,
to
take
the
first
question
first,
there's
no
question,
this
wolf
comes
as
a
wolf.
congress
was
going
after
2241.
it
clearly
did
that.
all
of
e(1)--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--is
a
new
subsection.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
souter,
h(1)
never
spoke
to
the
question.
an
earlier
provision,
d(1),
had
very
different
language,
in
an
earlier
provision
of
the
statute,
that
spoke
with
greater
clarity.
i'll
grant--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--you
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
gone.
but
just
because
congress
could
have
made
it
clearer
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
loses
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
senator--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
not
of
dispositive
significance,
justice
souter.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
a
very
fair
point,
justice
scalia.
but
even
to
get
at
the
very...
what
happened
here
is
very
analogous
to
the
legislative
evolution
this
court
found
unilluminating
in
martin
against
haddocks.
there,
the
attorneys
fees
provision
you
had
before
it...
before
you,
used
to
be
in
802
of
the
statute,
which
was
expressly
applicable
to
pending
cases.
congress
moved
it
out
into
its
own
separate
section
that
didn't
expressly
apply
to
pending
cases.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
this
court
did
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
souter,
but
there's
no
special
habeas
retroactivity
law.
there
is
a
special
rule,
under
st.
cyr,
for
habeas,
but
we
amply
satisfy
that,
because--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--22--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--this
whole
thing
is
a
2241(e)
new
section.
so,
this
is
all
about
amending
habeas.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
the
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that,
you're
right,
this
isn't
like
ex
parte
mcardle.
what
made
ex
parte
mcardle
so
unique
is,
congress
went
after
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction,
and
that
alone.
what
congress
has
done
here,
which
is
not
that
unusual,
and
it's
certainly
happened
several
times
since
mcardle,
is
that
the
court
has
modified
the
jurisdiction
of
all
the
courts,
and
that
has
had
the
effect
of
eliminating
jurisdiction
in
this
court
over
a
pending
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
happened
any
number
of
times.
the
guagliardo
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
provide
one
example.
and
as
justice
holmes
made
the
point
there,
it's
not
a
situation
where
you
go
after
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction,
as
such.
there,
it's
a
situation,
as
justice
holmes
put
it,
that,
when
the
root
is
cut,
the
branches
fall;
when
the
district
court
loses
jurisdiction
over
these
cases,
then
this
court
loses
jurisdiction.
but
it's
much
less
of
an
affront
to
this
court
than
the
kind
of
statute
that
congress
passed
in
the
mcardle
situation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
if
i
could
talk
to
various
aspects
of
that,
i'm
happy--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
do
so.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
let
me
try
to
hit
a
couple--
[laughter]
let
me
try
to
hit
a
couple
of
highlights.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
let
me
try
to
hit
a
couple
of
highlights.
this
is
much
more
of
a
call
for
military
commissions
in
a
real
war
than,
certainly,
the
use
of
military
commissions
against
the
medoc
indians
or
any
number
of
other
instances
in
which
the
president
has
availed
himself
of
this
authority
in
the
past.
i
think
the
events
of
9/11
speak
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
war
where
the
laws
of
war
are
involved.
as
to
whether
or
not
the
law
of
war
encompasses
the
crime
of
conspiracy
to
violate
the
laws
of
war,
we
think
that
is
clearly
established.
that
is
something
that
the
united
states
treated
as
a
valid
war
crime
in
the
civil
war.
that
is
something
that
the
united
states
treated
as
a
valid
war
crime
in
world
war
ii.
i
would
invite
you,
as
to
the
former,
to
look
at
winthrop's
treatise,
page
839,
note
5.
he
makes
it
very
clear
that
those
conspiracies
are
not
just
conspiracies
of
municipal
law,
what
he
called
"of
the
first
class",
but
they
included
the
second
class,
which
are
classic
war
crimes.
the
most
prominent
examples
are
the
lincoln
conspirators
and
a
conspiracy
at
andersonville
prison
to
deny
pows
their
lawful
rights.
clearly,
those
are
classic
war
crimes.
in
world
war
ii,
of
course,
conspiracy
was
also
charged.
and
this
court
saw
it
in
the
kearing
case,
although
it
didn't
reach
that
element
of
the
charge.
now,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
understand
that
history,
because
the
most
relevant
text
on
this
question
is
article
21's
reference
to
the
law
of
war.
and
as
this
court
was
crystal
clear
in
the
madsen
case,
what
that
reference
is,
is
congress's
effort,
when
it
extended
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
martials
to
include
more
and
more
crimes,
that
it
didn't
want
to
crowd
out
the
military
jurisdiction
of
the
military
commissions
just
because
they
had
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
this
court,
in
madsen,
said
what
congress
authorized
was
the
jurisdiction
of
the
military
commissions
as
it
existed
in
1916,
and
then
presumably
again
when
it
passed
article
21
of
the
ucmj,
the
jurisdiction
that
existed
as
of
1950.
well,
in
1960,
you
could
try
conspiracies
to
violate
the
law
of
war.
in
1950,
you
could
violate
conspiracies
to
the
law
of
war.
so,
now
let
me
try
to
get
to
the
procedures
that
would
be
applicable.
the
argument
that's
made
here
is
an
extraordinary
one,
that
article
36,
when
it
says
that
military
commissions
can
deviate
from
the
laws
of
evidence,
to
the
extent
the
president
determines
necessary,
except
that
it
must
apply
to
the...
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
ucmj.
clearly,
what
that
provision
means
is
the
provisions
of
the
ucmj
that
specifically
impose
requirements
on
the
military
commissions.
and
there
are
nine
of
them.
and
they
impose
some...
certain
minimum
rules.
but
to
say
that
that
provision
incorporates
all
of
the
ucmj
provisions
that
put
much
higher
requirements
on
courts
martials,
is
to
violate
this
court's
madsen
decision,
which
clearly
recognized
that
there
were
differences
between
court
martials
and
military
commissions.
and,
although
that
was
an
act...
that
was
a
case
that
addressed
the
articles
of
war,
article
38
is
identical
to
article
36(a)
of
the
ucmj,
so
that's
not
a
difference
that
matters.
and,
if
i
could
say,
the
other
thing
is,
that
just
violates
any
normal
principle
of
statutory
construction,
because
then
the
nine
express
references
to
the
military
commissions
are
rendered
utterly
superfluous.
clearly,
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
that,
"you
must
comply
with
those
provisions
of
the
ucmj
that
apply
specifically
to
the
military
commissions.
"
if
i
could
make
this
point
clear,
because
i
think
it's
helpful
in
reading
the
past
cases,
what
made
yamashita
and
other
of
the
world
war
ii
cases
so
difficult
is
that
the
president
in
that
situation
constituted
commissions
that
violated
even
the
procedural
rules
that
the
articles
of
war
made
specifically
applicable
to
the
commissions.
and
so,
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
justice
rutledge's
dissent
in
the
yamashita
case,
he
was
at
pains
to
emphasize
that
very
few
of
the
provisions
of
the
articles
of
war
applied
to
military
commissions.
and
the
difficulty
was
that
the...
that
the
military,
in
that
case,
was
not
complying
with
even
those
provisions
that
specifically
applied
to
military
commissions
by
terms.
that's
not
an
issue
here.
these
military
commissions
comply
with
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
ucmj
that
are
specifically
addressed
to
military
commissions.
so,
i
just
don't
think
there's
a
procedural
problem
here.
the
import
of
extending
article
2
jurisdiction
to
new
individuals
doesn't
mean
that
anything
in
yamashita,
as
to
this
point,
is
really
no...
is
still
relevant.
what
that
does
is,
it
takes
away
the
argument...
to
the
extent
that
these
individuals
are
within
article
2,
it
takes
away
the
argument
that
the
president
doesn't
have
to
even
comply
with
those
provisions
of
the
ucmj
that
are
expressly
directed
to
the
military
commissions.
but
that's
not
an
argument
we're
making
here.
the
argument
on
the
other
side
of
this
is
really
that
when
congress
specifies
that
nine
rules
apply
to
military
commissions,
and
everything
else
applies
to
courts
martials,
that
somehow
all
of
them
have
to
apply
to
the
military
commissions.
and
as
justice
scalia's
question
alluded
to
earlier,
in
order
to
accept
that
argument,
you
really
have
to
believe
that
what
congress
was
doing
when
it
was
carefully
preserving
the
military...
the
jurisdiction
of
the
military
commissions
was
simply
to
preserve
the
option
of
calling
something
that
had
to
comply
with
every
single
statutory
requirement
in
the
court
martials.
they
got
to
label
it
something
else.
they
got
to
label
it
a
"military
commission".
clearly,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
article
of
war
15
and
article
21,
as
they
were
developed
in
the
madsen
decision
and
discussed
in
the
authoritative
testimony
of
general
crowder,
that's
exactly
what
wasn't
going
on.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
this
argument,
that
as
we
get
more
and
more
things
that
come
within
the
military
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
martials,
that
somehow
we're
cutting
back
on
the
military
commissions.
that's
not
what
they
wanted.
the
next
thing
that
may
be
lurking
in
the
question
is
the
question
of,
what
about
the
geneva
conventions?
and
i
think
that,
very
importantly,
we
have
arguments
that
we
have
surfaced
in
our
briefs
that
the
geneva
conventions
do
not
provide
relief
in
these
circumstances,
that
they
do
not
apply,
for
various
reasons.
but
the
first
question,
at
the
outset,
is
whether
this
court
is
going
to
overrule
that
portion
of
eisentrager
that
basically
said
the
geneva
conventions
are
not
judicially
enforceable.
now,
of
course,
this
court
can
say,
"that
was
the
'29
convention,
and
this
is
the
1949
convention.
"
but,
as
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
determined--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
think
it
was
dicta,
justice
stevens.
if
there's
one
thing
i
think
the
eisentrager
decision
has,
it's
an
awful
lot
of
alternative
holdings.
and--
[laughter]
--justice
black
was
concerned
about
that,
and
said,
"what
are
you
doing
reaching
the
merits
when
you
have,
you
know,
said
there's
no
jurisdiction?
"
but
the
court,
as
a
holding,
said
that
the
geneva
conventions
of
1929
did
not
apply.
there
aren't
any
material
differences
about
1949
conventions.
and
i
ask
you
to
think
about
why
that
makes
sense.
because
the
1949
geneva
conventions
were
being
negotiated
contemporaneously
with
this
court's
decision
in
eisentrager.
and
even
if
you
think
the
rule
is
different
today,
at
that
point,
justice
jackson
was
quite
correct
that
the
idea
that
an
enemy
combatant
would
get
access
to
the
domestic
courts
of
a
detaining
power
was
absolutely
absurd.
and
so,
what
the...
the
framers
of
the
geneva
convention
recognized
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
group
of
people
that
were
uniquely
vulnerable.
so,
they
went
to
great
pains
to
make
sure
there
were
mechanisms
to
enforce
their
rights.
and
so,
there
are
various
provisions
for
party
to
party
enforcement.
there
are
various
provisions
for
getting
the
protecting
powers,
which
is
now
a
role
basically
taken
over
by
the
icrc,
to
get
access
to
the
detainees
and
to
provide
other
mediating
effects.
so,
what
you
have
is
a
treaty
that's
really
written
against
the
backdrop,
that
of
course
these
people
aren't
going
to
be
able
to
get
to
the
domestic
courts
of
their
detaining...
the
detaining
power.
if
you
look
at
the
treaty,
and
read
it
as
a
whole,
i
think
it's
almost
impossible
to
read
it
as
applying
judicially
enforceable
rights
in
the
domestic
courts.
the
constant--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
judge
williams
found
that,
you
know,
common
article
3
was
applicable
here.
i
don't
know
why
that
the
common
article
3,
and
nothing
else
would
be
judicially
enforceable.
and
i
don't
read
his
opinion
as
saying
otherwise.
i
think
he
still
took
the
view
that
the
entirety
of
the
geneva
conventions
were
not
judicially
enforceable.
now,
i
take
it
that
the
thrust
of
the
question,
though,
is,
don't
these
geneva
conventions,
even
if
they're
not
applicable
for
one
reason
or
another,
don't
they
form
the
background
of
some
sort
of
customary
international
law
that
influences
what...
how
we
should
interpret
the
word
"law
of
war"
in
the
statute?
and
i
would
say,
at
a
minimum,
if
there
is
some
role
for
customary
international
law
here,
it
has
to,
consistently
with
the
paquete
habana
case,
take
into
account
and
give
due
weight
to
a
controlling
executive
act.
here,
the
president
has
determined,
for
example,
that
conspiracy
is
an
actionable
violation
of
the
law
of
war
that
can
be
tried
in
front
of
these
commissions.
he's
made
that
clear.
he's
also
made
clear
that
these
procedures
are
sufficient
and
supply
the
rights.
and
so,
i
think
that
has
to
take...
be
taken
into
account
into
the
analysis.
i
think,
also,
since
article
21
is
the
most
logical
place
you
would...
you
would
look
to
any
of
this
as
the
law
of
war,
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
i
would
read
that
as
incorporating
some
question
about
what
kind
of
crimes
can
be
brought
in
this
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
sure
hope
not,
justice
breyer,
because
that's
been
the
tradition
for
over
200
years.
and
article
21
itself
makes
this
clear,
because
what
does
it
say
can
be
tried
by
military
commission?
it
says
anything
that's
made
a
violation
of
statute
or
law
of
war.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that
may
be
true,
justice
stevens--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--certainly
as
to
the
article--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--21
point.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
there's
no
innovation
in
trying
conspiracy
as
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
hope
so,
because
there's
really
no
question
that
conspiracy
has
been
charged.
and,
like
you
said,
i
would
encourage
you
to
look
at
footnote
5
on
page
839
of
the
winthrop
treatise;
and
this
quirin
case
had,
also,
that
charge
brought
before
it.
colepaugh
against
looney,
which
is
a
tenth
circuit
case
from
world
war
ii,
involved
the
charge
of
conspiracy.
now,
they're
going
to
come
up
here
and
tell
you,
"well,
but
that
wasn't...
you
know,
in
colepaugh
and
quirin,
that
wasn't
the
one
that
the
court
settled
on.
"
but
that
doesn't
dispute
the
fact
that
that
is
a
crime
that
has
traditionally
been
charged
as
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
he's...
i
mean,
i...
i'm
not
saying
that
he
isn't
somebody
who
is
protected
by
the
laws
of
war,
the
customary
laws
of
war.
i
think
that
he
is
protected
by
those.
i
don't
think
he's
protected
by
the
geneva
conventions,
but
that's
largely
because
he
chose
not
to
comply
with
the
basic
laws
of
war.
he's
obviously--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
is
the
point--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
i'm
making--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right,
but
not
the
domestic
courts
of
the
detaining
power.
and
if
he's
any
different
than
a
usual
prisoner
of
war,
it's
because
he's
disentitled
himself
to
some
protections
by
what
has
been
determined
by
the
ccert
protections.
let
me
just
address,
if
i
could,
the
idea
that
having
provided
him
with
ccert,
we
now
have
to
provide
him
with
an
article
5
hearing.
the
ccert
provisions
provide
all
of
the
protections,
and
then
some,
that
were
normally
provided
in
an
article
5
hearing.
they
were
focused
on
the
question
that
is
relevant
in
this
dispute,
which
is
whether
or
not
somebody
is
an
innocent
civilian
or
an
unlawful
enemy
combatant.
nobody
has
a
claim
here
that
they
were
part
of
the
uniformed
al
qaeda
division
that
complied
with
all
of
the
laws
of
war,
such
that
they
are
entitled
to
pow
status.
the
pow
unlawful
enemy
combatant
line
is
not
one
that
really
needs
to
be
policed
in
this
conflict.
the
serious
concern...
and
it
was
his
claim
when
petitioner
walked
into
federal
court
in
washington...
he
said,
"i
am
not
an
enemy
combatant.
"
"i
did
not
take
up
arms
against
the
united
states.
"
that's
the
claim
that
he
brought
to
the
ccert,
the
ccert
rejected.
for
these
purposes,
at
this
stage
in
the
litigation,
that
ought
to
be
enough
to
allow
the
proceeding
to
go
forward
in
front
of
the
military
commission.
one
of
the
defenses
in
the
military
commissions
is
lawful
combatancy
immunity.
he
can
make
the
argument
that
he
wants
to
make
in
front
of
the
commissions.
if
the
commission
rejects
the
argument,
then
there
will
be
review
of
that
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
concrete
record.
this
court
can
then
address
that
under
1254.
the
use
of
military
commissions
to
try
enemy
combatants
has
been
part
and
parcel
of
the
war
power
for
200
years.
congress
recognized
it
in
1916
in
the
articles
of
war,
then
again,
after
world
war
ii,
in
the
ucmj.
this
court
recognized
it
in
a
host
of
cases,
not
just
quirin,
but
yamashita,
eisentrager,
and,
most
clearly,
in
madsen.
since
that
is
such
an
important
component
of
the
law
of
war,
something
that
has
been
part
and
parcel
of
that
power
from
major
andre's
capture
to
today,
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
depart
from
that
tradition.
thank
you.
