justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
suppose
you
had
a
tribunal
that
was
properly
constituted,
as
you
contend
that
it
ought
to
be,
and
then
the
charge
was
conspiracy.
would
the...
would
the
courts
then
have
review
before
the
trial
proceeded?
and
let's
assume
that
it's
a
conspiracy
and
some
other
charge.
is
there
some
analog
in
ordinary
criminal
proceedings
where
you
challenge,
in
advance,
the
validity
of
the
charge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
tribunal
interpret
the
conspiracy
charge
to
mean
joint
enterprise,
which
would
be
closer,
at
least,
to
accepted
practice
in
the
international
tribunals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
still
not
sure
why,
if
we
think
that
there
is
merit
to
your
argument
that
the
tribunal
is
not
properly
established
anyway,
that
you...
we
have
to
reach
the
conspiracy
charge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
we...
and
if
we
think
that
you're
wrong
on
that,
i
don't
know
why
that
court
can't
hear
the
conspiracy
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
proof
were
to
show
that
there
was
very
substantial
and
knowing
involvement
rendering
him
basically
an
accomplice
or
a
principal,
but
it
was...
it
was
still
found
under
conspiracy.
would
international
law
violate
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume
that
he's
been
given
notice
of...
during
the...
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
as
to
what
the
charges
specifically
are
as
the
proof
is
adduced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
we
were
to
find
that
the
geneva
convention
or
other
settled
principles
of
international
law
were
controlling
here,
why
couldn't
we
just
remand
to
the
d.c.
circuit
and
let
it
figure
that
out?
or
let
it...
have
the
tribunal
figure
it
out,
in
the
first
instance,
assuming
the
tribunal
is
properly
authorized.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
we
told
the
d.c.
circuit
that
the
geneva
convention
or
some
other
body
of
international
law
controls,
and
just
remand
to
it
for
it
to
go
into
all
these
arguments?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
fundamentals,
other
than
personal
presence,
are
you
concerned
with
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
that
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
understand--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
nature...
the
appointing
authority
and
so
forth.
but
so
far
as
the
right
of
a
defendant
at
the
proceeding--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
right
to
be
present?
is
there
a
requirement
of
prompt
convening
of
the
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think,
as
a
minimum,
that
they
authorized
a
military
commission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
you
want
us
to
view
his
status?
do
we
accept
the
government's
submission
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
was
not
of...
in
a
formal
uniform,
that
he
was
not
a
formal
combatant,
but
that
he
was
aiding
and
abetting,
or
conspiring,
with
al
qaeda?
can
we
accept
that,
that
there's
probable
cause
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
in...
particularly
based
on
the
csrt
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
have
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
have
to
give
us--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
beginning
point.
you
have
to
give
us
a
beginning
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
have--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
have...
i
have
trouble
with
the
argument
that...
insofar
as
he
says
there
is
a
structural
invalidity
to
the
military
commission,
that
he
brings
that
before
the
commission.
and
the
historic
office
of
habeas
is
to
test
whether
or
not
you
are
being
tried
by
a
lawful
tribunal.
and
he
says,
under
the
geneva
convention,
as
you
know,
that
it
isn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
some--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--procedural...
it's
the
structural
requirement
of
the
composition
and
the...
and
the
appointing
origins
of
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that...
is
that
true?
if
a
group
of
people
decide
they're
going
to
try
somebody,
we
wait
until
that
group
of
people
finishes
the
trial
before
the
court...
before
habeas
intervenes
to
determine
the
authority
of
the
tribunal
to
hold
and
to
try?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
thought
that
the
historic
function
of
habeas
is
to...
one
of
its
functions...
is
to
test
the
jurisdiction
and
the
legitimacy
of
a
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--mr.
clement,
i,
for
one,
have
lost
track
of
your
time.
i'm
interested
in
your
arguments
on
the...
on
the
legitimacy
and
the
regularity
of
these
commissions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and,
in
particular,
why
isn't
he
part
of
common
article
3
under
the
geneva
convention,
as
judge
williams
found?
that's
part
of
the
same
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
time
is...
why
isn't
harm
done
on
a
uniquely
vulnerable
individual
that...
you
used
the
phrase
"uniquely
vulnerable
individuals"
were
involved
in
another
case,
but
not
here.
why
not
here?
