justice
clarence
thomas
i
have
filed
a
dissent
in
this
case,
which
justice
scalia
has
joined
and
which
justice
alito
has
joined
in
part.
in
15
terms
on
this
court,
i
have
never
read
a
dissent
from
the
bench;
but
today's
requires
that
i
do
so.
a
mere
ten
days
ago,
each
member
of
today's
plurality
deferred
to
the
army
corps
of
engineers
highly
questionable
determination
that
storm
drains,
roadside
ditches
and
desert
washes
are
navigable
waters
or,
rather,
waters
of
the
united
states.
today,
when
there
is
much
more
stake
than
ephemeral
pools
of
water,
the
plurality
and
the
court
repeatedly
refuse
to
defer
to
the
wartime
judgment
of
the
president
himself.
the
court's
determination
that
it
is
qualified
to
pass
on
the
military
necessity
of
the
commander
in
chief's
decision
to
employ
a
particular
form
of
force
against
our
enemies
is
unprecedented,
and
it
is
unsupported
by
any
authoritative
source
of
law,
and
as
specifically
refuted
by
every
relevant
historical
example.
accordingly,
i
respectfully
dissent.
today,
we
review
a
core
exercise
of
the
president's
commander
in
chief
authority,
one
expressly
approved
by
congress.
the
president's
decision
to
try
petitioner
for
war
crimes
before
a
military
commission
derives
support
not
only
from
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
which
expressly
recognizes
the
president's
prerogative
to
convene
military
commissions,
but
also
from
congress's
recent
authorization
permitting
the
president
to
use,
"all
necessary
and
appropriate
force,"
against
our
enemies
in
the
war
on
terrorism.
indeed,
in
the
hamdi
case,
the
majority
of
this
court
concluded
that
congress's
authorization
to
use
military
force
authorized
the
trial
of
unlawful
combatants
like
hamdan.
thus,
as
this
court
has
held
in
similar
contexts,
the
president's
actions
in
this
case
are,
,
"supported
by
the
strongest
presumptions
and
the
widest
latitude
of
judicial
interpretation."
but
today,
far
from
affording
the
president
the
deference
he
is
due,
the
plurality
and
the
court
second-guess
his
judgments
at
every
step.
the
plurality
would
hold
that
petitioner
has
not
been
charged
with
an
offense
triable
before
a
military
commission.
this
conclusion
is
unsupportable.
petitioner
has
been
charged
both
with
joining
a
war-criminal
enterprise
and
with
conspiring
with
al-qaeda
to
commit
various
war
crimes.
each
of
these
offenses
provides
an
independent
basis
for
petitioner's
trial
by
military
commission.
the
crime
of
unlawful
membership
in
a
war-criminal
organization
was
repeatedly
tried
before
civil
war
military
commissions
and
before
the
american
military
tribunal
in
nuremberg
and
is
recognized
in
all
of
the
relevant
treatises
as
a
crime
against
the
laws
of
war.
even
if
there
were
some
doubt
as
to
whether
petitioner
could
be
tried
simply
for
joining
al-qaeda,
it
is
undisputed
that
it
is
a
crime
against
the
laws
of
war
for
an
unlawful
combatant
to
provide
the
enemy
with
arms,
transportation
and
other
services.
petitioner
has
been
charged
with
supplying
such
provision
and
services
to
al-qaeda's
top
leadership,
and
thus
the
president
has
the
authority
to
try
him
on
these
grounds
alone.
in
addition,
the
charge
that
petitioner
conspired
with
members
of
al-qaeda
to
violate
the
laws
of
war
is
triable
by
military
commission.
conspiracy
to
violate
the
laws
of
war
was
the
sole
charge
in
the
highest
profiled
military
commission
trial
in
the
civil
war,
the
military
commission
trial
of
the
lincoln
conspirators,
and
was
also
charged
in
the
highest
profiled
case
in
world
war
ii,
the
military
commission
trial
of
the
quirin
saboteurs.
moreover,
the
orders
establishing
military-commission
jurisdiction
in
those
conflicts
expressly
provided
that
conspiracy
to
violate
the
laws
of
war
was
a
cognizable
offense,
and
the
treatises
were
filled
with
examples
of
military-commission
trials
on
the
charge
of
conspiracy.
the
court's
conclusion
that
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
requires
the
president
to
employ
the
same
procedures
in
petitioner's
military
commission
as
would
be
employed
in
court-martial
is
similarly
unpersuasive.
while
the
court
acknowledges
that
article
21
of
that
code
authorizes
the
president
to
convene
military
commissions
in
certain
circumstances,
it
fails
to
acknowledge
that
this
court
has
previously
held
that
article
21
preserves
the
common-law
war
status
of
military
commissions,
including
the
president's
authority
to
prescribe
their
structure
and
procedures
in
the
manner
he
sees
fit.
instead,
the
court
concludes
that
article
36(b)
of
the
code
requires
procedural
parity
between
military
commissions
and
courts-martial.
but
article
36(b)
does
not
mention
military
commissions
and,
thus,
cannot
plausibly
be
read
to
overrule
the
settled
meaning
of
article
21
as
preserving
the
president's
unfettered
authority
to
prescribe
military-commission
procedures.
rather,
article
36(b)
merely
implements
the
primary
purpose
of
the
code,
namely,
to
establish
procedural
uniformity
among
the
different
branches
of
our
armed-force
services.
it
does
not
require
procedural
uniformity
among
different
tribunals;
indeed,
the
code
itself
authorizes
different
tribunals
to
employ
different
procedures.
the
court
fares
no
better
in
its
analysis
of
the
common
article
3
of
the
geneva
convention.
as
an
initial
matter,
the
court's
determination
that
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
geneva
convention
are
judicially
enforceable
is
foreclosed
by
johnson
v.
eisentrager,
which
held
that
the
geneva
conventions
provide
an
exclusive
diplomatic
enforcement
scheme.
the
court
attempts
to
escape
this
holding
by
concluding
that
article
21
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
renders
the
geneva
conventions
judicially
enforceable;
but
that
position
is
untenable,
as
the
military
commission
in
eisentrager
was
also
subject
to
the
requirement
of
article
21.
moreover,
even
if
common
article
3
were
judicially
enforceable,
the
president
has
determined
that
it
does
not
apply
to
the
present
conflict,
and
that
determination
is
entitled
to
deference.
common
article
3,
by
its
terms,
applies
only
to,
"armed
conflict
not
of
an
international
character
occurring
in
the
territory
of
one
of
the
high
contracting
parties."
the
president
has
determined
that
common
article
3
does
not
apply,
because
the
present
conflict
is
of
an
international
character,
as
our
enemy
is
dispersed
throughout
several
nations;
that
is,
occurring
in
territories
of
more
than
one
of
the
high
contracting
parties.
the
court
does
not
suggest
that
the
president's
interpretation
is
implausible
or
even
unreasonable;
rather,
it
offers
its
own
admittedly
plausible
interpretation.
but
under
our
precedents,
we
must
defer
to
the
president's
reasonable
interpretation
of
a
treaty,
particularly
when
that
determination
pertains
to
the
nature
of
a
conflict.
the
court
does
not
so
much
as
acknowledge
these
precedents.
lastly,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
the
judicial
enforceability
of
common
article
3,
military
commissions
satisfy
the
requirement
of
that
provision.
military
commissions
are
plainly,
regularly
constituted,
as
they
have
been
constituted
in
numerous
conflicts
over
the
past
150
years,
and
have
been
upheld
on
several
occasions
by
this
court.
moreover,
the
procedures
that
govern
petitioner's
commission
entitle
him
to
the
judicial
guarantees
recognized
as
indispensable
by,
to
borrow
the
language
of
common
article
3,
"civilized
peoples;"
that
is,
he
is
presumed
innocent,
may
not
be
convicted
without
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
has
a
right
to
remain
silent
and
may
confront
witnesses.
this
is
the
straightforward
case
involving
fundamental
principles
and
controlling
precedents.
the
court
of
appeals,
by
adhering
to
these
principles
and
precedents,
unanimously
rejected
petitioner's
claims
in
a
mere
18
pages.
this
court
should
have
done
likewise.
