justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
number
05-184,
hamdan
against
rumsfeld.
mr.
katyal,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
katyal,
will
you
help
me?
where
is
the
conspiracy
charge
in
the
papers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay,
thank
you
very
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about
the
charge?
the
charge
is
not
just
conspiracy
in
the
abstract,
it's
conspiracy
to
do
specific
things,
one
of
which
is
attacking
civilians
and
civilian
objects.
and
is
it
clear
that
the
commission
would
not
have...
a
military
commission
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to
try
a
conspiracy
to
armed
civilians
in
a
war
zone,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
question?
supposing
the
charge
had
been
slightly
amended.
instead
of
saying,
"the
criminal
purpose,
and
conspired
and
agreed
with
osama
bin
laden
to
commit
the
following
offenses.
"
it
said,
"it
and
osama
bin
laden
attempted
to...
aided
and
abetted
in
committing
the
following
offenses.
"
would
it
then
be...
violate
the
laws
of
war?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
specific
offenses
are
attacking
civilians
and
attacking
civilian
objects.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
the
trial
judge
who
looked
at
the
indictment
or
ruling
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
or
its
equivalent
at
this
time...
said,
"well,
i'm
going
to
construe
these
words
"conspired
or
agreed"
as
the
substantial
equivalent
of
"aiding
and
abetting".
"
would
that
let
the
charge
stand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
language
is
"conspired
and
agreed
with".
and
"agreed
with"
is
pretty
close
to
"tried
to
do
it
himself".
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
certainly
may.
general
clement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let
me
just
ask
this
question,
mr.
clement.
what
sources
of
law
have
the
commissions
generally
enforced
over
the
years,
beginning
with
george
washington
and
so
forth?
just
army
regulations
or
american
law
or
foreign
law?
what
are
the
basic
sources
of
law
that
they
can
enforce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
we
have
here
is
enforcement
of
the
laws
of
war.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if...
just
one
hypothetical.
assume
that
the
laws
of
war
do
not
prohibit
conspiracy.
just
assume...
i
know
you
disagree
with
it.
could
the
president,
by
his
action,
add
conspiracy
as
a
triable
offense
by
a
commission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
easy
if
it
is
a
war
crime.
i'm
trying
to
wrestle
with
the
question
of,
if
we
concluded
that
it
were
not,
and
just...
and
i'm
asking...
can
the
question
add
an
additional
crime
that
the
commission
could
try?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
he
could.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
basic
position
you're
asserting
is
that
we
have...
that
the...
this
commission
intends
to
try
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war.
and
do
the
laws
of
war
then
have
any
application
to
the
procedures
that
they
have
to
follow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
clement--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
assume
that
the
laws
of
war
apply,
and
perhaps
the
treaty
applies,
isn't
the
issue
whether
this
is
a
"group
of
people",
on
the
one
hand,
or
a
"regularly
constituted
court",
on
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
argue
very
strenuously
that
this
is
really
just
a
"group
of
people"--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
it's
not
a
"regularly
constituted
court"
within
the
meaning
of
the
treaty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
ask
this,
to
clarify?
when
they
do
take
some
jurisdiction
of
some
habeas
corpus
claims,
do
you
defend
that,
in
part,
as
a
permissible
exercise
of
the
power
to
suspend
the
writ,
or
do
you
say
it
is
not
a
suspension
of
the
writ?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
can't
be
both.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
your
position,
they
did
not
suspend
the
writ.
you're
not
arguing
that
it's
a
justifiable
suspension
of
the
writ.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
was
a
footnote
dicta.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--think,
mr.
clement,
the
200
years
have
approved
of
his
adding
additional
crimes
under
the
law
of
war.
i
mean,
he
has
never...
i
don't
think
we
have
ever
held
that
the
president
can
make
something
a
crime
which
was
not
already
a
crime
under
the
law
of
war.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
the
issues
is
whether
he's
done
that
here--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
right
on
that,
you're
right
on
the
ultimate
question,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
katyal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
want
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
don't
want
to
take
up
from
your
time,
but
have
you
read
the
footnote
that
the...
mr.
clement
relies
on
very
heavily?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce

no.
05-184,
hamdan
against
rumsfeld.
petitioner,
a
foreign
national
held
in
custody
in
an
american
prison
at
guantanamo,
has
been
charged
with
one
count
of
conspiracy
to
commit,
offenses
triable
by
military
commission."
he
concedes
that
a
court-martial
convened
in
accordance
with
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
or,
of
course,
a
civilian
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
try
him;
but
he
contends
that
the
military
commission
convened
by
the
president
lacks
such
authority,
because
the
charge
does
not
allege
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war,
and
the
commission's
procedures
violate
both
the
ucmj
and
the
geneva
conventions.
the
district
court
granted
him
relief,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
and
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
our
judgment
is
supported
by
three
opinions.
my
opinion
speaks
for
the
court
on
the
jurisdictional
and
certain
merits
systems;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in

primarily
addressing
the
ucmj
and
geneva
convention
issues;
he
is

by
justices
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer;
and
justice
breyer,
joined
by
justices
kennedy,
souter
and
ginsburg,
has
filed
a
brief
concurring
opinion,
pointing
out
that
the
concerns
expressed
by
our
dissenting
colleagues
merely
require
the
president
to
seek
congressional
authorization
for
the
use
of
the
type
of
military
commission
that
he
has
established
by
executive
order.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
addressing
the
jurisdictional
issues;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
addressing
the
merits;
and
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
explaining
why
he
believes
that
the
commission
is
a
regularly
constituted
court
under
the
geneva
conventions.
the
chief
justice
has
taken
no
part
in
our
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
our
opinions
are
quite
long
--
mine
has
73
pages
--
but
i
will
try
to
be
brief
in
this
summary.
first
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
after
we
granted
review
in
this
case,
congress
enacted
a
statute
called
the
detainee
treatment
act,
or
dta.
one
section
of
the
dta
addresses
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
to
consider
claims
brought
by
individuals
like
hamdan,
who
are
being
detained
in
guantanamo
bay
and
elsewhere.
the
first
paragraph
of
that
jurisdictional
section
purports
to
prevent
any
federal
court
from
hearing
a
habeas
corpus
petition
brought
by
a
detainee.
the
other
two
paragraphs
of
the
same
section
channel
review
of,
"final
judgments,"
issued
by
combatant
status-review
tribunals
and
military
commissions
to
the
d.c.
circuit
and
also
defined
the
scope
of
that
review.
these
latter
two
provisions
are
expressly
made
applicable
to
cases
that
were
pending
on
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
dta
--
that
is,
on
december
31,
2005
--
but
the
provision
repealing
habeas
jurisdiction
is
not.
shortly
after
the
dta
was
enacted,
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
hamdan's
case
on
the
ground
that
the
new
statute
deprived
us
of
jurisdiction
to
consider
it.
we
delayed
consideration
of
the
motion
pending
argument
on
the
merit,
and
we
now
deny
the
motion.
congress'
failure
to
provide
that
the
jurisdiction-stripping
section
of
the
dta
applies
to
pending
cases
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
its
expressed
statement
that
the
other
jurisdictional
provisions
included
in
the
same
section
so
apply.
this
contrast
persuasively
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
jurisdiction-stripping
provision
to
apply
to
pending
cases.
that
inference
is
confirmed
by
the
drafting
history
of
the
dta.
early
versions
of
the
proposed
statute
would
have
achieved
exactly
the
result
the
government
urges
here.
they
would
have
expressly
made
the
jurisdiction-stripping
provision
applicable
to
pending
cases.
following
full
debate
and
further
amendments,
however,
congress
removed
that
language.
statements
made
by
senators
during
floor
debates
on
the
act,
not
after
the
act
was
passed,
including
statements
by
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
final
bill,
uniformly
support
the
view
that
removal
of
that
language
was
intended
to
preserve
jurisdiction
over
pending
cases.
the
government
also
argues
that
even
if
we
do
have
jurisdiction,
we
should
abstain
from
considering
hamdan's
claims
until
the
military
commission
has
convicted
him
of
the
offense
with
which
he
is
charged.
for
the
reasons
given
by
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
we
disagree.
the
comity
considerations
underlying
the
usual
rule
of
abstention
in
military
cases
do
no
apply,
because
hamdan
is
not
a
member
of
our
armed
forces,
and
his
commission
is
not
part
of
a
congressionally
crafted
system
of
military
justice.
in
these
unique
circumstances,
which
involve
a
special
tribunal
created
not
by
congress,
but
by
the
executive
branch,
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
at
this
time
the
jurisdictional
and
procedural
challenges
that
petitioner
has
raised.
turning
to
the
merits
of
hamdan's
claims,
we
consider
first
whether
the
commission
that
was
convened
to
try
him
had
been
authorized
by
congress.
although
we
conclude,
as
we
did
an
ex
parte
quirin,
that
article
21
of
the
ucmj
recognizes
the
president's
power
to
convene
military
commissions
in
some
circumstances,
we
note,
as
we
did
in
quirin,
that
that
power
is
carefully
circumscribed.
article
21
incorporates
the
common
law
governing
military
commissions
and
conditions
the
president's
power
to
convene
such
commissions
on
compliance
with
the
law
of
war,
which
includes
international
instruments
like
the
geneva
conventions.
the
president
also
must
comply
with
any
applicable
requirements
of
the
ucmj
itself.
one
article
of
the
ucmj,
article
36,
is
particularly
relevant.
article
36(a)
requires
that
any
rules
the
president
adopts
to
govern
proceedings
before
courts-martial
and
military
commissions
alike
be
consistent
with
other
provisions
of
the
ucmj.
among
these
other
provisions
is
a
requirement
that
the
accused
be
present
during
most
proceedings.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
procedures
adopted
to
try
hamdan,
whose
trial
was
in
process
when
this
case
began,
allow
the
accused
and
his
civilian
counsel
to
be
excluded
from
proceedings
and
to
be
prohibited
from
seeing
certain
evidence.
these
and
other
departures
from
courts-martial
procedures,
including
the
failure
to
adopt
court-martial
rules
governing
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
may
not
technically
be
inconsistent
with
other
provisions
of
the
ucmj.
technical
consistency
with
the
ucmj
itself
is
not
the
only
requirement
under
article
36,
however.
under
subsection
(b)
of
that
article,
the
rules
for
military
commissions
and
court-martials
must
be
uniform
insofar
as
practicable.
this
uniformity
requirement,
which
was
added
to
the
ucmj
after
world
war
ii
and
our
decisions
in
quirin
and
yamashita,
codifies
the
historical
practice
of
using
court-martial
proceedings
when
military
commissions
are
being
used
absent
some
exigency.
the
admitted
deviations
from
court-martial
proceedings
in
this
case
are
not
justified
by
any
evident
impracticability.
there
is
no
suggestion,
for
example,
of
any
logistical
difficulty
in
securing
properly
sworn
and
authenticated
evidence
or
in
applying
the
rules
of
evidence
that
apply
in
courts-martial.
the
danger
posed
by
international
terrorists,
while
certainly
severe,
does
not
by
itself
justify
dispensing
with
usual
procedures.
because
the
procedures
adopted
to
try
hamdan
do
not
comply
with
the
uniformity
requirement
of
article
36(b),
we
conclude
that
the
commission
lacks
power
to
proceed.
for
similar
reasons,
the
commission
lacks
power
to
proceed
under
the
geneva
conventions,
which
are
part
of
the
law
of
war
under
article
21
of
the
ucmj.
common
article
3
of
those
conventions,
which
we
hold
applicable
to
this
case,
prohibits
the
passing
of
sentences
without
previous
judgment
by
a
regularly
constituted
court,
affording
all
the
judicial
guarantees
recognized
as
indispensable
by
civilized
peoples.
as
justice
kennedy
explains
in
his
separate
writing,
the
regular
military
courts
in
our
system
are
the
courts-martial
established
by
congressional
statute.
of
course,
articles
21
and
36
of
the
ucmj
envision
the
use
of
military
commissions,
but
they
also
place
constraints
on
that
use.
at
a
minimum,
a
military
commission
specially
convened
by
the
president
can
be
regularly
constituted
only
if
some
practical
need
explains
deviations
from
court-martial
practice.
as
i
have
said
and
as
justice
kennedy
elaborates
further
in
his
opinion,
no
such
need
has
been
demonstrated
here.
in
a
part
of
the
opinion
that
justice
kennedy
did
not
join,
because
he
regards
the
discussion
of
the
merits
in
his
opinion
in
the
portions
of
the
court
opinion
that
he
has
joined
as
sufficient
to
support
our
judgment,
we
conclude
that
the
commission
violates
common
article
3
in
another
respect,
because
its
rules
permit
exclusion
of
the
accused
from
his
own
trial
and
prevention
of
his
access
to
evidence
against
him.
at
least
absent
some
expressed
congressional
provision
to
the
contrary,
customary
international
law
requires
that
a
defendant
be
permitted
to
see
and
hear
the
evidence
against
him.
finally,
in
another
part
of
the
opinion
that
justice
kennedy
did
not
join,
we
conclude
that
the
offense
with
which
hamdan
has
been
charged,
conspiracy
to
commit
acts
of
terrorism,
is
not
an
offense
triable
by
this
kind
of
military
commission.
military
commissions
historically
have
taken
three
forms:
first,
they
have
been
used
to
stand
in
for
civilian
courts
and
to
try
civilian
crimes
in
territory
governed
by
military
law
when
the
civilian
courts
are
closed.
they
were
so
used
during
the
civil
war,
for
example;
second,
they
have
been
used,
again
as
stand-in,
for
civilian
courts
in
occupied
territory,
such
as
germany
after
world
war
ii;
third,
they
have
been
used
to
try
violation
against
the
law
of
war
during
time
of
war,
typically
when
courts-martial
lack
jurisdiction
to
try
a
particular
defendant
or
offense.
hamdan's
commission
is
of
the
third
type.
therefore,
in
the
absence
of
express
statutory
authority,
it
can
try
only
those
crimes
that
according
to
the
common
law
violate
the
law
of
war.
in
such
cases,
neither
the
elements
of
the
offense
nor
the
permissible
punishment
is
defined
by
any
statute.
for
that
reason,
commentators
have
generally
described
this
type
of
military
commission
as
utterly
different
from
the
other
two.
conspiracy
is,
of
course,
a
crime
under
federal
statute
and
under
the
ucmj;
but
no
treaty
or
domestic
statute
makes
conspiracy
a
war
crime,
and
the
historical
materials
from
this
country,
as
well
as
international
sources,
confirmed
that
it
is
not
a
war
crime
under
the
common
law
of
war.
the
nuremberg
judges,
for
example,
pointedly
refused
to
recognize
conspiracy
to
commit
war
crimes
as
a
standalone
war
crime.
the
leading
treatise
on
military
law
in
this
country
does
not
list
conspiracy
of
any
kind
as
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war
and
says
that
law
of
war
commissions
may
try
people
only
for
committing
or
attempting
to
commit
overt
acts
that
violate
the
law
of
war;
and
incidentally,
none
of
the
overt
acts
that
hamdan
allegedly
committed
acting
as
osama
bin
laden's
bodyguard
and
driver,
transporting
weapons
and
receiving
training,
is
itself
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war.
it
is
not
enough,
in
our
view,
to
identify
a
few
instances
in
which
a
person
has
arguably
been
charged
with
or
convicted
of
conspiracy
by
a
law
of
war
commission.
we
must
be
cautious
in
developing
and
extending
the
common
law
of
crimes.
that
caution
is
all
the
more
critical
when
the
project
is
to
discern
the
common
law
as
developed
and
not
by
courts,
but
by
military
officers.
under
these
circumstances,
the
precedent
establishing
a
particular
offense's
status
as
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war
must
in
our
judgment
be
clear
and
unambiguous.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
because
the
jurisdiction
of
the
law
of
war
military
commission
stands
and
falls
with
the
validity
of
the
charge,
we
conclude
that
the
defect
in
the
charge
against
petitioner
precludes
this
military
commission
from
proceeding.
as
justice
breyer
points
out
in
his
separate
concurrence,
our
decision
today
is
a
limited
one.
we
decide,
in
effect,
that
congress
has
denied
the
president
the
legislative
authority
to
create
this
military
commission.
nothing
prevents
the
president
from
returning
to
congress
to
seek
the
authority
he
believes
necessary,
and
no
emergency
stands
in
the
way
of
such
an
effort.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
