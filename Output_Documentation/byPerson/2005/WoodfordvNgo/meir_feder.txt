mr.
meir
feder
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
there
are
three
basic
reasons
that
a
procedural
default
rule
should
not
be
read
into
the
plra.
the
first
is,
the
text
of
section
1997(e)
is
most
naturally
read
as
requiring
simple
exhaustion,
which
is
satisfied
once...
when
there
are
no
remedies
available
at
the
time
the
suit
is
filed.
mr.
meir
feder
well,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
that
in
the
habeas
cases
the
court
has
consistently
read
"exhaustion"
as
referring
simply
to
"no
remedies
presently
available".
mr.
meir
feder
well--
mr.
meir
feder
--first--
mr.
meir
feder
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we're...
that
administrative
law
is
the
appropriate
analogy
here.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
habeas
provides
a
much
closer
source
of
meaning
for
the
word
and
concept
of
"exhaustion"
here,
both
because
of
the
similarity
of
the
language
in
the
exhaustion
provision
here,
and
the
habeas
exhaustion
provision,
because
of
the
fact
that
both
are
prisoner
litigation.
there
is
an
overlap
between
habeas
cases
and
section
1983
cases
in
this
context.
and--
mr.
meir
feder
--well,
actually,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
any
indication
that
congress
was
focused
on
input
from
the
prison
grievance
system.
in
fact,
the
way...
the
way
it
works
is
that
once
the
prison
grievance
system
addresses
the
claim
that's
of
no
effect
in
the
subsequent
federal
suit,
which
starts
over
from
square
one--
mr.
meir
feder
--well,
two
things.
first,
as
i
say,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why,
in
looking
at
the
language
congress
was
using,
it's
more
reasonable
to
look
to
the
habeas
statute.
but
even
in
the
administrative
law
context,
this
is
dramatically
different
from
most
administrative
law
circumstances,
because
in
those
situations
you
have
an
administrative
decision
that
is
in
some
way
being
reviewed,
the
administrative
agency
record
may
have
some
effect.
here,
you
don't
have
that
aspect
of
review,
and
the
administrative
context
that
is
close
to
this,
if
you're
looking
for
an
administrative
analogy,
is
the
title
vii
and
age
discrimination
act
cases,
because
those
cases,
similarly,
provided
for
invocation
of
state
remedies
that
were
designed
to
give
the
state
an
opportunity
to
resolve
the
case
voluntarily,
if
that
would
satisfy
the
prospective
plaintiff,
but
if
the
plaintiff
were
not
satisfied,
he'd
be
able
to
move
on.
and
i
think
that
both
opposing
counsel
have
made
a
point
of
saying
that
the
oscar
mayer
case
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
an
exhaustion
requirement
in
oscar
mayer,
but,
rather,
that
it
used
the
word
"commence".
but
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
what
the
court
said
it
meant
by
saying
it
wasn't
an
exhaustion
requirement.
and
this
is
at
441
u.s.
at
761,
and
the
court
said,
"section
14(b)
does
not
stipulate
an
exhaustion
requirement.
"
"the
section
is
intended
only
to
give
state
agencies
a
limited
opportunity
to
settle
the
grievances
of
adea
claimants
in
a
voluntary,
localized
manner
so
that
the
grievants
thereafter
have
no
need
or
desire
for
independent
federal
relief.
"
so,
the
sense
in
which
the
court
was
saying
that
that's
not
an
exhaustion
requirement
is
basically
saying
that
that
scheme
is
like
this
one,
where
the
plra
does
not
approach
attempting
to
reduce
the
federal
prisoner
claims
by
kicking
cases
out
of
court
indiscriminately
or
by
defaults;
it
aims
to
reduce
it
by
raising
the
degree
of
difficulty
for
the
prisoner
in
getting
to
federal
court
in
various
ways--
mr.
meir
feder
--certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
meir
feder
well,
we're
not--
mr.
meir
feder
--we're
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
meir
feder
yes.
mr.
meir
feder
your
honor,
i
think
that...
there
are
a
few
points
to
respond
to
there...
i
think
that
the
provision
does
make
sense
that
way.
i
mean,
first,
it's
worth
nothing
that
the
plra
was
working
very
well
before
procedural
default
even
came
into
the
picture.
the
first
court
of
appeals
decision
recognizing
procedural
default
under
the
plra
was
in
2002.
the
petitioner
has
statistics...
petitioners
have
statistics
in
their
brief
showing
that
between
1995
and
2000
there
was
already
a
nearly
50
percent
drop
in
the
rate
of
inmate
filings.
but
going
specifically--
mr.
meir
feder
--but
there
is
no...
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
of
there
being
widespread
defaults.
but
i
should
address
your
question
about
how
this
advances...
why
the
provision
wouldn't
be
meaningless
without
procedural
default.
and
there
are
least
three
ways
that
it
is
still
meaningful.
the
first
is,
it
removes
any
rational
incentive
for
the
prisoner
to
evade
the
grievance
system.
i'll
come
back
to
that
in
a
second.
i
just
want
to
say
the
second
and
third
things
are,
it
gives
the
state
an
opportunity
to
address
the
grievance,
if
it
wants
to,
and,
at
a
minimum,
it
delays
and
raises
the
degree
of
difficulty
for
the
prisoner.
but
going
back
to
the
incentives,
there
are
two
basic
reasons
why
an
inmate
might
rationally
want
to
evade
the
grievance
process.
and,
i
mean,
there's
this
notion
here
of
prisoners
scheming
to
get
around
the
grievance
process
and
deliberate
bypass.
and
it's
completely
overblown,
because
the...
there
are
two
basic
reasons
the
prisoner
might
want
to.
first,
if
proceeding
with
the
grievance
and
having
it
adjudicated
in
the
prison
grievance
system
could
somehow
harm
his
later
federal
suit.
second
would
be
to
get
to
federal
court
faster.
neither
one
of
these
things
happens
under
the
plra,
even
without
a
procedural
default
rule
being
read
into
it.
on
the
first
thing,
the
prisoner
is
not
affected
in
federal
court,
unlike,
say,
a
habeas
case,
where
a
prisoner
may
want
to
evade
a
state
court
decision,
because
that
decision
will
get
deference
in
the
later
federal
habeas
proceeding.
here,
the
grievance
decision
is
of
no
force
and
effect.
that
incentive
is
not
there.
mr.
meir
feder
i...
your
honor,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
really
makes
sense
to
say
that,
within
this
kind
of
time
periods
that
we're
talking
about,
that
that's
really
going
to
help
the
inmate's
claim,
because...
i
mean,
we're
dealing
here
within--
mr.
meir
feder
--i
understand,
your
honor,
but
everything
here
is
within
the
framework
of
the
section
1983
statute
of
limitations.
and...
which
is
set,
presumably,
to
be
able
to
adjudicate
claims
with...
on
the
theory
that
it's
fresh
enough...
reasonably
fresh
if
it's
within
whatever
that
period
is
in
the
particular
state;
2
years,
in
many
states.
so,
the
idea
that
something...
that
the
guard
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
testify
6
months
later
is,
i
think,
you
know,
maybe
at
the
margins.
it's
not
likely
to
affect
this.
mr.
meir
feder
well,
your
honor,
again,
i
think
that,
at
a
minimum...
even
if
you
grant
that
there
may...
the
prisoner
may
see
some
advantage
in
that,
there
is,
at
a
minimum,
a
substantially
smaller
incentive
than
you
would...
than
you
would
have
in,
for
example,
a
habeas
case.
but
i
want
to
get
to
the
second
thing,
which
is,
i
think,
the
more
likely
incentive
that
existed
before
the
plra.
before
the
plra
is
passed,
if
a
prisoner
wants
to
get
to
federal
court
as
quickly
as
possible,
the
prisoner,
the
day
after
he
suffers
whatever
injury
he
feels
he
has
suffered,
can
go
about
filing
his
federal
claim.
the
plra,
with
or
without
a
procedural
default
rule,
prevents
that.
he
can't
do
that,
because,
first
of
all,
he
has
to
wait
until...
if
he's
going
to
avoid
the
grievance
system
for
some
reason,
he
has
to
wait
until
that
time
has
run.
but
he
then
can't
just
go
and
file
in
federal
court.
if
he
just
files
in
federal
court,
he's
going
to
get
bounced
back,
because
he
still
has
a
potential
remedy
in
the
grievance
system
that
he
hasn't
filed.
the
united
states
says
that
we've
conceded
that,
in
systems
where
there
isn't
some
sort
of
discretion
that
we
are
to
consider
a
late
claim,
that,
in
that
case,
the
prisoner
is
not
going
to
have
to
file.
we
do
not
concede
that
at
all.
i
don't...
you
can
look
at
our
brief,
at
page
43...
i
don't
think
we
concede
that.
we
do
refer
to
the
fact
that
california
and
many
other
states
provide
for
discretion.
but
the
fact
is
that,
in
any
event,
we're
not
talking,
here,
about...
with...
in...
with
grievance
time
limits,
we're
not
talking
about
something
like
a
notice
of
appeal
requirement
that's
jurisdictional,
that's
going
to
bar
it
from
being
appealed.
if...
there's
always
a
possibility,
particularly
since
many
of
these
systems
are
internal
rules
of
the
grievance
system,
that,
one
way
or
another,
it
can
be
considered.
and
i
think--
mr.
meir
feder
--and
what
i'm
saying
now,
your
honor,
is
that
he
can't
just
wait
and
not
file.
mr.
meir
feder
because
he
will
not
have
exhausted
until
he
files
and
has--
mr.
meir
feder
--well,
two
things
about
that.
mr.
meir
feder
part
of--
mr.
meir
feder
--part
of--
mr.
meir
feder
--well,
your
honor,
i
think...
again,
first
of
all,
it's
a...
it's
important
to
understand
that
we
are
saying
he
will
have
to
file,
in
all
circumstances.
it's
not
necessarily
clear--
mr.
meir
feder
--that
the
state--
mr.
meir
feder
--i
understand.
mr.
meir
feder
putting
that--
mr.
meir
feder
--yes,
certainly.
mr.
meir
feder
first
of
all,
there
is
always
the
possibility,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
grievance,
that
the
prison
may
address
it.
for
instance,
if
the
complaint
is
a
failure
to
protect
claim,
and
the
prisoner
is
being
harmed
by
being
placed
with
another
prisoner,
who
is...
who's
dangerous
to
him,
if
the
state
gets
that
complaint
late,
they
may...
they
may
very
well
still
want
to
act
on
it
and
ameliorate
that
situation,
and
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
could,
in
the
end,
satisfy
the
prisoner
and
have
him
not
sue.
but
the
other
thing
is,
even
if
the
state...
assuming
the
state
doesn't
address
it,
the
prisoner,
again,
has
to
not
just
file
that;
there
is
an
appeals
process
that
normally
he'll
have
to
go
through,
although,
in
this
case,
the
california...
the...
excuse
me...
the
prison
appeals
coordinator
just
said,
"i'm
not
even
going
to
file
it,
so
you
can't
appeal.
"
normally,
though,
you
would
think
you
would
be
able
to
appeal.
he'll
have
to
go
through
the
entire
system.
at
best,
for
him,
he's
delayed
a
long
time.
and
the
way
congress
approached
this
was
to...
by
provisions
like
for
costs
and
fees
and
so
forth...
was
to
attempt
to
dissuade
prisoners
from
filing.
this,
at
a
minimum,
is
going
to
help
to
dissuade
him
from
filing,
coupled
with
the
fact
that,
because
he
is
not
getting
to
court
faster,
he
doesn't
have
what,
before
the
plra,
would
have
been
the
main
incentive
to
bypass
a
system
that
otherwise
isn't
going
to
hurt
him.
mr.
meir
feder
yes,
there
are
a
lot
of
provisions
in
the
plra
that
may
prevent
him
from
actually
attending,
but--
[laughter]
--in...
in
any
event,
i
guess
the
point
here
is,
first
of
all,
he
has...
there
are
appeal
levels,
whether
or
not...
no
matter
what
the
grounds
something
is
rejected
on,
there
are...
normally
would
be
an
appeal
through
the
entire
system.
there
is
nothing
requiring
the
state
to
speed
it
through
the
appeals
process
if
the
state
feels
that
it's
important
for
the
prisoner
not
to
be
able
to
get
to
federal
court
as
quickly
as
possible.
and,
also...
i
mean,
one
thing
that
we're
not
getting
to
here,
that
i
think
is
important...
well,
i
should
state
one
more
thing
before
leaving
that.
i
mean,
booth
also
tells
us
that
congress
did
see
value
in
requiring
prisoners
to
file,
even
when
it
seemed
very
unlikely
that
they
would
get
the
relief
that
they
were
seeking.
and
the
ways
in
which
this
requires
a
prisoner
to
file,
and
delays
him,
are
significant
in
many
of
the
same
ways.
but
the
other
very
important
point
here
is
that
in
considering
the
reasonableness
of
doing
this
with
or
without
a
procedural
default
requirement,
sure,
with
procedural...
excuse
me,
a
procedural
default
rule...
with
that,
of
course,
you're
going
to
make
the
provision
somewhat
more
effective,
but
there's
a
tradeoff.
and
the
tradeoff
is,
you're
going
to
make
it
more
effective
by
kicking
prisoners
out
of
court
on
a
nonmerits
ground.
and
congress...
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
made
it
clear
they
were
not
meaning
to
kick
out
potentially
meritorious
claims.
you
also
are
creating
another
bad
incentive,
which
is,
with
this
procedural
default
rule,
the
prison
officials
have
the
incentive
to
try
to
get
rid
of
cases
on
nonmerits
grounds,
because
if
they
rule
on
a...
on
a
procedural
ground,
then
the
prisoner
can't
file.
if
they
rule...
if
they
address
it
on
the
merits,
then
the
prisoner
has
the
chance
of
going
there.
so,
in
that
respect,
the...
a
procedural
default
rule
makes
it
less
likely
something
gets
affected
on
the
merits.
but
the
point
is,
there's
a
policy
tradeoff
here,
that
there
is--
mr.
meir
feder
--no
indication--
mr.
meir
feder
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
meir
feder
no,
i'm--
mr.
meir
feder
--saying--
mr.
meir
feder
--to--
mr.
meir
feder
--no,
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
there's...
there
is...
there
is
no
good
reason
to
avoid
them.
i
certainly
don't
mean
to
be
suggesting
that,
if
i...
if
i
misspoke.
but
i
think...
the
important
point
here
is,
though,
there's
a
real
policy
tradeoff.
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
language
of
the
act,
or
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history,
that
this
is
a
policy
tradeoff
that
congress
actually
was
willing
to
make.
and
i
guess
i
didn't
touch
on
the
language,
but
there
are
numerous
textual
indications,
as
we
argue
in
detail
in
our
brief,
even
aside
from
getting
to
the
word
"exhausted",
that
congress
contemplated
simple
exhaustion,
and
there's
no
sign
of
any
contemplation
of
a
procedural
default
rule.
the
word
aedpa.
there
was...
at
one
point,
there
were
provisions
in
the
same
bill
that...
one
of
which
was
an
exhaustion
provision
in
aedpa,
and
one
of
which
was
the
early
version
of
this.
there's
no
indication
that
exhaustion
was
used
in
different
contexts
there.
and
the
habeas
cases
make
clear
that
a
defaulted
claim
is
exhausted,
and
it's
a
timely
requirement.
on
the
legislative
history,
if
there
was
an
expectation
that
there
would
be
this
sort
of
procedural
default
rule
and
prisoners
would
forfeit
claims...
and,
as
you
can
tell
with
2
or
3-day
filing
deadlines
some
places,
and
other
technical
requirements
elsewhere...
there
would
be
expected
to
be
a
number
of
forfeitures,
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
thought
one
of
the
ways
the
plra
would
reduce
suits
was
by
causing
forfeitures.
and,
in
addition,
it's
important
to
understand
that,
although,
as
we
concede,
the
provision
will
be...
will
not
be
as
effective
without
a
procedural
default
rule,
but
it
still
does
have
some
effect
without
the
procedural
default
rule,
the
problem
with
imposing
a
procedural
default
rule
is
that
the
consequences
of
that
are
very
troubling,
because
what
you'd
be
doing
then
is
essentially
incorporating
every
state,
and
local
jail
facility,
for
that
matter,
filing
deadline
as
a
de
factor
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
meir
feder
--for--
mr.
meir
feder
--i
would
like--
mr.
meir
feder
--i
would
like
to
think
that,
your
honor,
but,
actually,
as
opposing
counsel
has
indicated,
congress
eliminated
the
language...
the
pre
existing
language
that
placed
some
sort
of
requirement...
it
removed
the
"plain,
speedy,
and
effective.
"
language,
removed
the
"minimum
standards"
language.
the
indication
was
that
they
wouldn't
be
reviewed
for
the
adequacy
of
the
standards.
mr.
meir
feder
i
think...
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
that's
actually
an
indication
that
congress
was
not
expecting
it
to
have
this
sort
of
harsh
consequence,
where
you're
taking
whatever
procedural
rule
from
whatever
state.
another
thing
about
the
plra,
aside
from
removing
the
old
language,
is
that
one
of
the
goals
of
the
plra
was
to
remove
intrusive
federal
judicial
oversight
from
prison
systems.
and
if
you
were
going
to
be
in
a
position
of
reviewing
everything
for
reasonableness,
you
have
exactly
that
kind
of
oversight
saying,
you
know,
"your
procedure
is
adequate.
"
"yours
isn't
adequate.
"
and
that's
what...
that's
what
congress
removed.
the
consequences
also
mean
that
if
this
procedural
default
rule
is
accepted,
you
could
have
even
continuing
violations,
continuing
unconstitutional
conduct
that
would
not
be
challengeable,
could
be
insulated
from
federal
review
after
the
passage
of
a
short
deadline
or
violation
of
whatever
other
procedure,
fair
or
unfair,
that
a
state...
that
a
state
creates--
mr.
meir
feder
--yes.
i
think
there
clearly
is.
mr.
meir
feder
yes.
mr.
meir
feder
yes.
i
think...
i
think
it
is.
because
i
think
that
until
it
becomes
absolutely
clear
that
the
state--
mr.
meir
feder
--or
the
grievances--
mr.
meir
feder
--sorry?
mr.
meir
feder
and
they...
and
if
it
does
it
as
a
binding
rule
that's
not...
that's
not
subject
to
change,
i
suppose
that
that...
that
that
would
be
possible.
but
the
fact
is...
actually,
a
good
example
is,
in
one
of
the
administrative
cases
that
the
united
states
cites
in
their
brief,
the
united
states
versus
l.a.
tucker
lines,
what...
the
argument
there
is,
"we
didn't
need
to
present
this
argument
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
because
they
had
a
rule
that
meant
that
they
couldn't
accept
our
claim,
and
the
court...
and
the
court
says
no
to
exhaust.
"
"you
do
have
to
present
the
claim.
"
"they
may
change
it.
"
mr.
meir
feder
then
it'll...
then,
presumably,
if
the
state
rejects
it
on
that
ground,
if
he
tries
to
file
in
federal
court,
he'll
get
sent
back
for
having
failed
to
actually
complete
his
exhaustion
obligations
until
he
manages
to
file
a--
mr.
meir
feder
--claim
that
would
satisfy--
mr.
meir
feder
--i
think
that
maybe
it's
possible,
in
some
cases,
as
a
sanction
for
bad
faith
conduct.
conceivably...
i'm
not
sure
where
that
would
come
from...
but
if
he
fails
to
present
the
claim
in
a...
in
a
way
that
it
can
be
addressed,
he
has
to...
he
can't
come
to
federal
court
until
he
presents
it
to
them
in
a
way
in
which
it
at
least
could
have
been
addressed.
mr.
meir
feder
it's
only
binding--
mr.
meir
feder
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
the
state
were
to
say
that
you...
that,
"this
is
definitively
rejected,
and
we're
not
going
to
let
him
amend
it.
"
then,
in
that
case,
you
would
have
satisfied
exhaustion,
as
far
as
the...
but
only
if
it's
definitive.
otherwise...
well...
and
i
should
just
go
back
to
the...
to
the
point
i
was
making
about
a
continuing
violation.
for
instance,
let's
say
there
is
a
failure
to
protect
claim.
someone
is
in
danger,
doesn't
file.
he's
in...
he's
in
one
of
the
states
where
it's
2
days.
i
think
michigan
is
one
of
those.
he
doesn't
file
within
2
days.
the
state
has...
after
that,
can
say,
"you
can't
go
to
federal
court,
because
you
haven't
met
our
deadline.
"
in
this
case,
here,
there
was
a
continuing
violation
that
was
alleged,
and
the...
and
the
state
basically
said,
"our
rule
is,
even
if
it's
continuing,
you
have
to
file
it
within
30
days...
or
15
days
of
when
it
first
arose.
"
and,
i
mean,
you
can
imagine
a
number
of
circumstances
where
this
rule
here
would
mean...
again,
any
prison
or
local
jail
procedural
rule,
no
matter...
is
a...
presumably,
until
you
get
to
the
point
of
violating
due
process,
would
be
a
basis
for
saying
that
prisoners
don't
have
to
go
to
court.
there
is
nothing
in
the
words
of
the
statute
that
suggest
that,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
that
suggest
it.
the
only
real
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
congress
must
have
meant
to
include
it,
because
that's
what
"exhaustion"
usually
means.
mr.
meir
feder
well,
except
that
he's
not
permanently
barred,
because
if
he...
if
he
hasn't
exhausted,
he
gets
sent
back
and
has
to
at
least
file
the
last
appeal.
thank
you,
your
honor.
