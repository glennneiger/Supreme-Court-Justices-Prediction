mr.
dan
himmelfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
united
states
agrees
with
petitioners'
submission
that
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
inconsistent
with
the
text,
history,
and
purposes
of
the
plra
exhaustion
requirement.
we
would
add
that
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
has
consequences
that
congress
could
not
have
intended.
to
begin
with,
under
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation,
a
prisoner
can
wait
years
to
file
an
administrative
claim,
such
that
it
is
virtually
certain
that
the
prison
will
reject
the
claim
as
untimely
and
not
decide
the
claim
on
the
merits.
that
is
hardly
different
from
not
requiring
an
exhaustion
requirement...
not
requiring
exhaustion
at
all.
indeed,
respondent
candidly
concedes...
this
is
on
page
43
of
his
brief...
that,
under
his
interpretation,
if
the
prison
system
does
not
give
prison
decisionmakers
any
discretion
to
decide
an
untimely
claim,
the
prisoner
would
not
have
to
file
an
administrative
claim
at
all.
all
he
would
have
to
do
is
wait
for
the
filing
deadline
to
pass.
in
addition,
if
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation
is
correct,
the
plra
would
be
the
only
context
in
the
law
in
which
a
claimant
who
is
required
to
exhaust
would
be
able
to
get
into
federal
court
by
virtue
of
untimely
exhaustion;
that
is,
without
complying
with
filing
deadlines.
it
would
be
odd,
to
put
it
mildly,
if
congress
intended
to
adopt
such
a
uniquely
forgiving
exhaustion
rule
as
part
of
a
statute
whose
very
purpose
was
to
combat
abusive
litigation
by
prisoners.
respondent's
submission
is
that
the
administrative
law
principle,
the
established
administrative
law
principle,
that
exhaustion
requires
compliance
with
the
agency's
procedural
rules,
is
inapplicable
here,
because
what
we're
dealing
with
is
what
he
calls
an
original
proceeding
rather
than
a
review
proceeding.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
probably,
justice
kennedy.
and
that
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
that
involves
exhaustion
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
it
doesn't
involve
administrative
exhaustion.
and,
of
course,
the
court
abandoned
that
principle,
which
was
the
deliberate
bypass
exception
to
the
procedural
default
rule,
years
ago,
i
believe
in
1977,
in
favor
of
the
cause
and
prejudice
exception
in
wainwright
versus
sykes,
which
was
subsequently
codified
by
congress
in
aedpa.
but
there
is
no
administrative
exhaustion
context,
of
which
we
are
aware,
where
untimely
exhaustion
is
sufficient.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
respondent
places--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--heavy--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
the...
this
court
has
made
clear,
in
various
cases,
including
in
the
very
context
of
the
exhaustion
provision
at
issue
here,
in
the
booth
versus
churner
decision,
that
there
are
no
exceptions
to
the
exhaustion...
to
an
administrative
exhaustion
requirement
when
congress
provides
otherwise;
that
is,
in
the
context
of
statutory,
as
opposed
to
a
judge
made,
exhaustion
requirement.
it
is
the
case
that
what
is
required
under
the
plra
is
exhaustion
of
available
administrative
remedies.
so,
under
some
of
the
hypotheticals
that
the
court
was
suggesting...
for
example,
if
there
were
a
6-hour
filing
deadline;
and,
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
there
is
no
prison
that
has
a
6-hour
filing
deadline...
but,
if
there
were,
and
in
that
particular
case,
for
some
reason,
the
prisoner
were
unable
to
comply
with
the
deadline,
because,
for
example,
forms
were
unavailable
or
he
was
in
a
hospital
bed,
incapacitated,
or
he
was
in
solitary
confinement,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
federal
court
to
conclude
that
the
remedy
at
issue
was
not
available;
and,
therefore,
that
he
didn't
have
to
pursue
that
remedy;
he
would
be
able
to
get
into
federal
court,
assuming
he
had
otherwise
complied
with
the
prison's
procedural
requirements.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
reasonableness
is
the
right
way
to
think
about
it,
justice
breyer.
it
is
not
a...
in
our
view,
it's
not
a
categorical
question
of
whether
a
particular
filing
deadline
is
reasonable
or
not
in
the
view
of
the
court.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
our
only
point,
justice
breyer,
is
that
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
for
a
court
to
look
at
a
particular
filing
deadline
in
a
prison.
most
of
them,
incidently,
are
somewhere
between
14
and
30
days.
but
if
there
were,
for
example,
a
24-hour
filing
deadline,
our
submission
is
that
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
for
a
court
to
look
at
that
deadline
and
say,
"we
think
that
that's
just
too
short,
and,
therefore,
unreasonable.
"
it
would
only
be
appropriate
to
say
that
the
remedy
wasn't
available
if...
regardless
of
the
length
of
the
filing
deadline...
in
a
particular
case,
the
facts
were
such
that
literally
the
prisoner
were
unable
to
pursue
that
administrative
remedy.
if
he
were
literally
unable
to
do
so,
the
remedy
would
not
be
available
under
the
plra
exhaustion
provision.
the
case
on
which
respondent
places--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--justice
stevens,
i
think
there
would
be
cases...
and
that
might
be
one
of
them...
that
would
present
difficult
questions.
under
your
hypothetical,
for
example,
if
the...
if
it
were
clear
that
there
were
explicit
threats--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--from
the
guard--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--if
a
prisoner
filed
a
1983
or
bivens
action,
and
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
i
would
think--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that
could
be
an
issue
that
would
have
to
be
litigated
in
connection
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
exhaust.
if
the
prisoner
alleged,
and
could
prove,
for
example,
that
he
received
explicit
threats
from
the
prison
guard
that,
if
he
filed
this
administrative
claim,
harm
would
come
to
him,
i
would
think
that
a
court
could
permissibly
find
that
that
wasn't
an
available
remedy.
but
short
of...
short
of
explicit
threats,
i
think
he
would...
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
issue--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--and
a
much
harder--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--case.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
there
would
have...
if
the
remedy
was
not
available,
because
the
prisoner--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
but
there...
you
would...
you
would
often
have
factual
issues
in
connection...
maybe
not
"often"...
you
would
sometimes
have
factual
issues
in
connection
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
might
transform
it,
in
effect,
into
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
when
there
is
an
exhaustion
defense
raised
by
the
prison.
and
that
might
be
an
example...
i
think
that
would
be
a
rare
case,
but
that
might
be
an
example
of
where
that
would
happen.
i
do
want
to
respond
to
respondent's
reliance
on
the
oscar
mayer
case.
the
distinction
between
oscar
mayer
and
this
case
is
that
that
case
did
not
involve
an
exhaustion
provision.
the
court
explicitly
stated,
in
oscar
mayer,
that
the
provision
at
issue,
a
provision
of
the
adea,
does
not
stipulate
an
exhaustion
requirement.
the
requirement
was
one
of
commencement.
it
obligated
the
claimant
to
go
to
a
state
administrative
agency,
wait
60
days,
and
then
he
was
free
to
go
into
federal
court.
exhaustion
requires
a
claimant
to
go
to
an
agency
and
complete
his
remedies.
in
oscar
mayer,
the
court
relied
on
features
of
the
provision
at
issue
there
that
are
not
present
here,
and
it
said,
correctly,
that
the
provision
at
issue
there
had
the
purpose
of
providing
a
claimant
with
a
limited
opportunity
to
obtain
relief
in
the
state
administrative
process.
the
plra
exhaustion
provision
was
enacted
to
give
the
prison
a
full
and
fair
opportunity,
not
a
limited
opportunity,
to
provide
relief
before
a
prisoner
is
entitled
to
go
into
federal
court.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
there
are
lots
of
statutory
exhaustion
requirements
that
are
framed
in
lots
of
different
types
of
language.
some
say
"until",
some
say
"unless",
some
say
"before",
some
say
"after",
some
say
"only
if".
but,
in
every
single
context
of
which
i
am
aware,
they
incorporate
the
settled
administrative
law
principle
that
a
claimant
has
to
comply
with
the
agency's
procedural
requirements.
