would
you
agree
that
there's
a
requirement
that
the
exhaustion
period
be
reasonable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
his
best
case,
your
brother's
best
case,
in
your
view...
and
you
probably...
may
not
think
of
it
as
a
very
persuasive
case...
fay
and
noia,
is
that
the
closest
respondents
can
come?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--could--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
respondent
tell
us,
well,
that
at
least
in
some
administrative
law
schemes,
generally
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
exhaustion
period
must
be
reasonable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure.
it
seems
to
me,
as
justice
scalia's
question
indicates...
i
was
surprised
that
we're
talking
about
procedural
default.
i,
too,
thought
this
was
an
administrative
law
case.
and
it's
an
administrative
law
case,
because
we
want
the
input
of
the
administrative...
of
the
administrative
body.
in
the
habeas
cases,
we're
simply
giving
deference
as
a
matter
of
comity
and
courtesy
to
the
state
courts.
is
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
not
so
much
maybe
input,
but
so
that
they
can...
they
can
resolve
the
program...
the
problem
within
the
institution,
and
not
have
to
come
to
the
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
as
i
interpret
your
argument,
you're
saying
that
there
is
some
merit,
some
benefit,
to
avoiding
the
state
administrative
procedures.
what
you're
saying
is
that,
"you
know,
these"--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
"#
administrative
procedures
aren't
all
that...
they're
cracked
up
to
be.
"
"there's
a
good
reason
to
avoid
them.
"
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
a...
that's
a
difficult
argument
for
us--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
accept.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
you
could
add
to
that,
that
mr.
himmelfarb
wouldn't
even
accept
"reasonable".
he
said
it
has
to
be
"impossible"
to
comply
with.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
true
even
if
the
state
does
not
have
a
procedure
for
reopening
for
late
claims?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
state
says,
"we
don't
consider
late
claims".
