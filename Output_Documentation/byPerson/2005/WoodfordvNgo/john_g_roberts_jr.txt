chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
05-416,
woodford
versus
ngo.
ms.
perkell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
ms.
perkell,
could
i
ask
you
to
speak
up
just
a
bit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thanks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
suppose
there
can
always
be
a
specific
objection
to
the
reasonable
availability
of
a
particular
remedy.
i
mean,
if
this...
the
prison
remedy
is,
you
know,
within
5
minutes
you've
got
to
file
a
complaint
or
something.
but
that's
not
the
question
here.
the
question
here
is
what
the
plra
requires,
as
a
general
matter,
with
respect
to
prison
remedies.

justice

g.
roberts,

ms.--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--perkell,
perhaps
you'd
like
to
save
your
remaining--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--time
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
himmelfarb,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
himmelfarb.
mr.
feder.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes
it
is.
because
the
whole...
one
of
the
reasons
you
have
reasonably
short
time
is
that
you
get
the
witnesses
there,
they
remember
it.
if
you
have
to
file
within
15
days
with
the
prison,
the
prisoner
does
that,
the
guard
is
there,
"do
you
remember
what
happened"?
"yes.
"
"this,
this,
and
this.
"
"who
else
was
there"?
"these
people
were
there".
you
wait
3
months,
the
prisoner
files
a
complaint,
they
ask
the
guard,
"do
you
remember"?
"not
really.
"
"it
was
3
months
ago.
"
"i'm
not
sure".
then
he
has...
you
know,
the
evidence
against
him
is
much
weaker
when
he
files
his
claim
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
the
point
is
that
if
he
complies
with
the
time
limit,
it's
going
to
hurt
his
claim;
therefore,
he
doesn't
want
to
comply
with
the
time
limit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
were
suggesting
that
the
prisoner
had
no
incentive
not
to
comply
and
go
through
his
state
grievance
procedure.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
you
have
the
short
procedures
are
to
maintain
a
fresh
record
that
more
accurately
reflects
the
truth,
and,
since
congress
was
acting
against
the
backdrop
in
which
they
thought
there
were
too
many
frivolous
cases,
they
thought
that
might
be
one
way
to
limit
those.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
feder.
ms.
perkell,
you
may
have
a
minute
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
in
05-416,
woodford
versus
ngo.
