ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether,
in
enacting
the
prison
litigation
reform
act's
exhaustion
requirement,
congress
intended
to
require
inmates
to
comply
with
administrative
grievance
procedures
or
whether
congress
intended
to
permit
inmates
to
ignore
those
procedures.
petitioners
submit
that
congress
intended
to
require
inmates
to
comply
with
administrative
grievance
procedures,
for
three
principal
reasons--
one,
the
established
principle
of
exhaustion
in
the
administrative
law
context
requires
a
grievance...
a
grievant
to
timely
comply
with
administrative
agency
proceedings.
two,
in
enacting
the
prison
litigation
reform
act's
exhaustion
requirement,
congress
was
responding
to
this
court's
decision
in
mccarthy
v.
madigan,
in
which
this
court
presumed
that
an
express
or
mandatory
exhaustion
requirement
for
prisoners
would
necessitate
compliance
with
prison
filing
deadlines.
and,
three,
congress's
objectives
in
enacting
the
prison
litigation
reform
act's
exhaustion
requirement
are
directly
facilitated
by
a
rule
in
which
inmates
must
comply
with
administrative
grievance
procedures,
including
filing
deadlines;
whereas,
those
objectives
are
invariably
subverted
when
an
inmate
is
permitted
to
ignore
those
procedures.
in
the
administrative
law
context,
the
established
principle
of
exhaustion
generally
requires
that
a
grievant
comply
with
administrative
agency
proceedings
in
a
proper
and
timely
manner
in
order
to
be
able
to
proceed
to
federal
court.
in
this
case,
congress
has,
indeed,
enacted
an
administrative
exhaustion
requirement.
even
the
court
of
appeals
that
in
so
doing
congress
was
attempting
to
bring
the
exhaustion
rule
for
prisoners
more
into
line
with
established
administrative
exhaustion
rules
that
apply
in
other
contexts.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
i
would
suggest...
i...
we
concede
there's
that
distinction.
however,
i
would
suggest
it's
irrelevant
for
purposes
of
how
congress
would
have
understood
the
term
"exhaust"
in
enacting
the
statute.
the
definition
of
the
"principle
of
exhaustion"
in
administrative
law
is
one
in
which
there's
an
obligation
to
comply
with
the
agency's
grievance
proceedings.
and
so,
that
is
the
definition
of
exhaustion
that
congress
was
presumably...
i
would
suggest
was
presumably
invoking
in
this
context.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
well,
your
honor,
in
the
first
instance--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--oh,
sure.
i--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--i
apologize.
again,
we're
submitting
that
congress
understood
the
term
"exhaust"
in
a
particular
way,
given
how
it's
just
generally
used
in
the
administrative
context.
and
with
respect
to
the
eeoc
context,
we
think
that
that
is
inapposite,
because
primarily
that...
the
relevant
statutes
in
those
contexts
invoke
the
word
"commence",
which--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--the
word
"commence"
instead
of
"exhaust",
which
this
court
has
expressly,
again,
distinguished
from
an
exhaustion
requirement.
moreover,
under
those
statutes
congress
has
limited
the
meaning
of
"commencement"
in
such
a
way
that
this
court
has
interpreted
congress
to
expressly
preclude
the
possibility
of
a
procedural
default
by
virtue
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
state
filing
provisions.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
i'm
suggesting
in
that...
in
the...
excuse
me...
in
the
administrative
law
context,
which
is
the
context
in
which
congress
was
legislating
under
this
statute,
that
that
is,
indeed,
the
established
conception
of
that
term.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
what
your
honor--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--oh.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
well,
i
would
suggest
that,
in
part,
the
language
of
the
cripa,
which
is...
i
believe,
is...
that's
how
i
pronounce
it;
i
believe
that's
what
your
honor
is
referring
to...
in
part,
precluded
the
possibility
of
a
default...
procedural
default
bar
largely
because
it
required
a
continuance
of
a
case
for
90...
or
i
believe
it
started
out
as
180
days,
and
then
became
90
days.
and...
in
order
to
permit
the
judge
to
order
the
inmate
to
go
back
and
exhaust...
and
under
those
circumstances,
even
if
he
had
been
untimely
by
virtue
of
the
continuance
language,
he
was,
nonetheless,
permitted
to
return
to
federal
court.
so,
i
think
by
virtue
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
it's
at
least
possible
that
congress
had
a...
deliberately
excluded
that
possibility.
moreover,
i
think
that
the
statutory
history
and
the
statutory
purposes
in
this
case
support
the
conclusion
that
congress
intended
inmates
to
require
with
applicable
grievance
proceedings.
and
if
i
may
refer
to
the
statutory
history,
in
this
court...
excuse
me,
in
booth
v.
churner,
this
court
recognized
that
this
court's
prior
decision
in
mccarthy
v.
madigan
constituted
a
substantial
of
the
statutory
history
from
the
plra's
exhaustion
requirement.
and,
in
relevant
part,
for
purposes
of
the
question
presented
here,
that
decision
observed
that...
or
assumed
that
an
exhaustion...
a
mandatory
exhaustion
requirement
for
prisoners
would
necessitate
the
compliance
of
administrative
filing
deadlines.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
that
is
so.
this
court--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--this
court
made
that
observation.
it
was
one
of
two
grounds
upon
which
this
court
relied
in
holding
that
this
court
would
not
judicially
impose
a
mandatory
exhaustion
requirement
for
prisoners
under
that
decision.
so,
the
first
part
of
this
decision
evaluated
the
text
of
the
former
version
of
1997(e),
and,
in
the
second
part
of
this
decision,
this
court
said,
"nonetheless,
notwithstanding
that
the
statute
doesn't
expressly
require
exhaustion,
we
will
not
judicially
impose
exhaustion
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
such
a
requirement
would,
indeed,
represent
a
possibility
of
forfeiture
of
a
claim
for
an
inmate's
failure
to
comply
with
deadlines.
"
and,
again,
as
this
court
recognized
in
booth
v.
churner,
that
decision
is
a
significant
part
of
the
statutory
history
of
this
provision,
and
this
court
presumed
that
congress
was
responding
to
that
decision
when
it
revised
1997(e).
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
dispute
that,
in
that
our
reading
of
the
opinion,
as
well
as
the
government's
brief
in
that
case,
seemed
to
propose
no
unusual
rule
of
exhaustion.
it
appeared
that
the
rule
of
exhaustion
that
was
being
discussed
was
an
ordinary
rule
of
exhaustion.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
anything
unusual
about
the
exhaustion
concept
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case.
finally,
i
would
submit
that
congress's
purposes
in
enacting--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--what
did
representative
lobiondo--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--say?
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
the
significance
of
excerpting
that
provision
was
to,
in
part,
demonstrate
that
congress
was,
indeed,
aware,
consistent--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--he--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--well--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
relevant
things
about
that
statement.
first
is
the
significance
of
his
referencing
the
mccarthy
case
and
demonstrating
affirmatively
that
congress
was,
indeed,
aware
of
that
decision
when
it
revised
the
statute.
but,
moreover,
it
was
another
iteration
of
the
purposes
that
congress
sought
to
achieve
through
enactment
of
the
statute.
so,
speaking
to
the
third
point,
which
was
purposes
of
the
statute,
our
position
is
that
those
purposes
are
directly
served
by
a
rule
in
which
inmates
are
required
to
comply
with
administrative
grievance
proceedings.
by
contrast,
those
rules
are
subverted
by
a
rule
in
which
an
inmate
is
permitted
to
file
an
untimely
appeal,
which
is
rejected
on
procedural
grounds,
and
which,
therefore,
receives
the
benefit
of
no
prior
administrative
review.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
it's--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--that
is
correct.
those
were
proceedings
that
were
noted
on
one
of
the
briefs.
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
presume
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
variety
of
prison
filing
deadlines
when
it
enacted
this
statute.
and
i
also
think
that
it's
reasonable
to
presume
that
congress
intended
for
those...
for
whatever
grievance
procedure
the
state
sets
forth
to
be
governing
in
this
instance.
and
this
is
because,
under
the
former
version
of
the
statute,
the
cripa,
congress
had
required
that
grievance
proceedings
comply
with
specified
standards,
specified
federal
standards.
and
in
the
new
version
of
the
statute,
congress
dispensed
with
those
requirements.
and
i
think
that
the
obvious
conclusion
to
draw
from
that
change
was
that
congress
was
intending
for...
whatever
prison
procedures
are
established
in
any
given
situation
are
those
that
are
going
to
govern
the
inmate's
appeal
process.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
i
think
the...
always,
the
relevant
inquiry,
especially
in
light
of
the
statute...
or
precisely
because
of
the
statutory
language,
the
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
remedies
are,
indeed,
available
and
capable
of
use
by
the
inmates.
so,
without
any
further
facts,
yes,
i
would
treat
a
2-day--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--filing
period.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
it
could
conceivably
be.
as
long
as
remedies
are,
indeed,
available
to
the
inmate,
there
is
an
obligation
under
the
statute
that
he
exhaust--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
and
as...
we
are
submitting
that
we
it
does,
indeed,
require
compliance
with
the
administrative
grievance--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--i'm...
i...
the
requirement
that
i
think
is
relevant
under
the
statute
is
whether
or
not
the
procedure
is
available.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
that
is...
yes,
your
honor,
that
is--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--that
is
a
conceivable--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--conceivable--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--scenario.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
i--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--i
presume,
from
that,
that
congress
had
shifted
its
focus
in
the
new
statute
to
the
purposes
that
we
have
articulated
in
the
brief,
one
of
them
being--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
that
is
our--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--position.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
yes,
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that.
congress
was
legislating,
enacted
this
statute
for
the
purpose
of
addressing
a
particular
category
of
section
1983
actions
in
which
it
appears
that
congress
reached
the
conclusion
that
there
was
be...
there
was
an
abuse
of
that
process
under
1983.
and
so,
the
purpose
of...
what
this--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
first
dispute
that
a
2-hour
time
limitation
would
necessarily
keep
out
a
lot
of
cases.
as
long
as
it's
an
available
remedy--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--your
honor,
it--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--your
honor,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
my
preference,
but
i
certainly
wouldn't
suggest
that
it
was
a
remedy
unavailable
or
incapable
of
use
by
anyone,
if
you
take
into
consideration
other
aspects
of
the
prison
grievance
procedure.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
so--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--yes.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
i
think
what...
in
this...
as
occurred
in
this
case,
the
inmate
has
made
this
contention
that
there
was
a
continuing
violation.
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
district
court
to
evaluate
that
question
under
the
grievance
proceeding
at
issue
and
under
the
facts--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--as
presented.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
i
would
suggest
that
the
law
of
the
prison
grievance
proceeding.
if
there's--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--well,
in
california
the
requirement
is
that
an
inmate
must
file
a
grievance
within
15
working
days
or
3
weeks
of
the
event
or
decision
at
issue.
the
facts
in
this
case--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--well,
i
would
submit
that
the
facts
of
this
case
actually
show
that
the
events
at
issue
are
the
two
decisions
that
were
made
which
resulted
in
consequences
with
which
the
inmate
was
dissatisfied.
those
two
decisions
were
the
first
decision--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--that
is
correct.
and,
again,
the
district
court
could
be
called
upon
to
address
that
question,
as
appears
to
be
the
case
here,
and
the
district
court
would
endeavor
to
apply
the
rules
of
the
grievance
proceeding
to
the
facts
regarding
exhaustion.
if,
in
the
event
the
grievance
proceeding
didn't,
for
instance,
sufficiently
put
the
inmate
on
notice,
didn't
provide
clarity
on
whether
or
not...
on
what
he
had
to
do
under
circumstances
where
there's
a
continuing
consequence
to
a
decision,
perhaps
in
that
instance
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
decide,
yes,
indeed,
he
had
exhausted,
given
the
ambiguity
on
that
point
in
the
regulations.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
if--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--yes.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
three
quick
points,
your
honors.
it's
not
so
much
that
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
creates
an
incentive
for
an
inmate
to
file
untimely,
it's
that
it
doesn't
create
the
incentive
to
file
timely.
moreover,
respondent
is
relying
on
the
habeas
corpus
analogy,
but,
at
the
same
time,
he
wants
the
results
under
the
plra
to
be
different
from
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
and,
third,
untimely...
the
rule
of
untimely
exhaustion
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit
undermines
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
because,
first,
prisons
will
usually
enforce
their
deadlines,
and
grievances
will
not
receive
any
merits
review
before
they
reach
federal
court.
and,
second,
because
grievances
filed
untimely,
and
particularly
months
or
years
untimely,
deprive
prisons
of
a
genuine
opportunity
to
investigate
and
respond
to
prisoner...
or
they
do
deprive
prisons
of
a
genuine
opportunity
to
investigate
and
respond
to
prisoner
grievances,
because
oftentimes
witnesses,
evidence,
and,
in
particular,
recollections,
are
no
longer
available.
unless
the
court
has
any--
ms.
jennifer
g.
perkell
--thank
you.
