justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
would
treat
a
state
with
a
2-day
statute
of
limitations
just
like
your
state,
with
a
15-day
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--available
for
2
days,
so
that's
had
a...
so,
i
suppose
it
would
be
okay
for
6
hours,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
apply
to
a
prisoner
who
claimed
he'd
been
raped
by
a
guard
or
something,
but
was
afraid
to
bring
the
proceeding,
for
2
or
3
weeks,
until
the
guard
was
transferred
to
another
facility?
and
he
alleged
those
facts,
and
then
he
was
denied
relief
because
it
was
over
15
days.
would
that
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
those
are--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--his
allegations.
these
are
just
his
allegations.
and
when
that...
and
they
then
said,
"no,
it's...
you're
out
of
time.
"
could
a
federal
court
take
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
he...
first
he
files
a
prisoner
complaint,
17
days
late,
but
makes
the
allegations
i
describe,
and
he's
just
denied
because
he's
too
late.
could
a
federal
court
take
that
case,
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
he'd
have
to
file
a
second...
subsequently
file
a
1983
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
even--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
it
was
seven--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--even
after
the
17th
day,
the
federal
court
could
hear
a...
have
a
factual
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
just
alleged
it
as...
in...
and
the
only...
the
only
response
from
the
state
is,
2
days
late>
["].
that's
all...
that's
all
the
state
has
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
be
sure--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
one
thing
about
your
position.
you
do
agree,
do
you
not,
that
in
order
to
exhaust,
even
if
the
time
has
run
the
15-day
period,
there
is
an
obligation
to
go
to
the
state
and
ask
them
to
hear
the
case,
even
though
it's
untimely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you
do
say
that
you
at
least
will
give
the
state
the
opportunity
to
decide
whether
it
wants
to
try
and
remedy
it
in
an
informal
or
hasty
manner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
