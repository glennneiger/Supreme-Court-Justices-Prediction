what
if
the
claim
is
presented
in
a
way
that's
gibberish,
it's
impossible
to
understand?

he
can--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--but
it
can
never
be
procedurally
defaulted,
because
the
claim
isn't
presented
in
a
comprehensible
form
to
the...
to
the
prison
grievance
officials?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit.
petitioners
are
california
prison
officials,
and
respondent
is
a
prisoner
who
was
in
their
custody.
in
october
of
2000,
respondent
was
placed
in
administrative
segregation
for
alleged
misconduct
in
the
san
quentin
prison
chapel.
two
months
later,
he
was
returned
to
the
general
population;
but
he
claims
that
he
was
excluded
from
participating
in
a
variety
of
religious
activities.
respondent
filed
a
challenge
to
this
exclusion
under
california’s
administrative
prison
grievance
system
six
months
later.
california
law
gives
prisoners
15
working
days
to
file
such
a
grievance,
and
respondent’s
grievance
accordingly
was
rejected
as
untimely.
after
unsuccessfully
appealing
that
decision
internally,
respondent
filed
the
underlying
lawsuit
against
petitioners
in
federal
district
court.
the
district
court
dismissed
respondent’s
suit
for
failing
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies,
as
required
by
the
exhaustion
provision
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
the
plra.
respondent
appealed
and
the
9th
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
respondent
had
exhausted
administrative
remedies,
because
no
such
remedies
were
any
longer
available.
this
decision
was
consistent
with
the
decision
of
the
6th
circuit,
but
conflicted
with
decisions
of
four
other
courts
of
appeals.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
the
plra
states
that
a
prisoner
may
not
bring
an
action
with
respect
to
prison
conditions
until
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available
are
exhausted.
we
hold
that
this
means
that
a
prisoner
must
properly
exhaust
administrative
remedies,
which
includes
compliance
with
time
limits.
the
plra
refers
to
administrative
remedies,
and
in
administrative
law,
the
general
rule
is
that
courts
should
not
topple
over
administrative
decisions
unless
the
administrative
body
not
only
has
erred,
but
has
erred
against
objection
made
at
the
time
appropriate
under
its
practice.
that
is
the
united
states
versus
tucker
truck
lines.
this
doctrine
serves
several
purposes:
it
gives
agencies
a
fair
opportunity
to
fix
their
own
mistakes
before
being
held
into
federal
court,
and
it
discourages
disregard
of
agency
procedures;
it
also
promotes
efficiency,
as
meritorious
claims
are
often
settled
at
the
administrative
level,
and
a
loss
at
that
level
may
convince
a
party
not
to
seek
a
remedy
in
federal
court.
because
exhaustion
requirements
are
designed
to
deal
with
parties
who
may
not
want
to
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies,
administrative
law
creates
an
incentive
for
parties
to
give
the
agency
a
fair
opportunity
to
consider
their
claims.
administrative
law
does
this
by
requiring
proper
exhaustion
as
a
condition
for
going
to
federal
court.
the
reason
for
requiring
proper
exhaustion
is
straightforward:
no
adjudicative
system
can
function
effectively
if
parties
are
free
to
disregard
its
procedural
rules.
the
law
of
habeas
corpus
also
requires
proper
exhaustion,
but
it
uses
different
terminology.
the
text
and
general
scheme
of
the
plra
show
that
the
act
adopts
the
administrative-law
concept
of
proper
exhaustion.
the
act
was
intended
to
reduce
the
quantity
and
improve
the
quality
of
prisoner
litigation,
and
proper
exhaustion
is
needed
to
serve
these
ends.
proper
exhaustion
gives
state
officials
an
adequate
opportunity
to
consider
and
resolve
meritorious
claims,
and
it
creates
a
record
for
a
subsequent
review
of
claims
that
cannot
be
resolved.
the
interpretation
urged
by
respondent
would
thwart
the
purposes
of
the
plra.
it
would
permit
prisoners
to
deliberately
bypass
prison
grievance
systems,
and
respondent
has
not
identified
any
statute
or
case
that
allows
this.
we
are
confident
that
congress
did
not
create
such
an
ineffectual
scheme
here.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissent,
in
which
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
join.
