but
that's
the...
a
function
of...
you
want
the
first
line
decisionmaker...
you
need
that
decision,
because,
at
the
second
rung,
in...
at
the
court
level,
deference
is
owed
to
it.
but
in
the
prison
setting,
there's
no
deference
owed
to
it.
so,
i
would
think
that
this
kind
of
requirement,
that
you
must
file
someplace
else
first,
a
place
that
won't
get
deference,
is
more
like
the
eeoc
example
and
the
age
discrimination
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
invoke
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you...
are
you
saying,
then,
that
those
two
go
together,
they're
inextricably
tied
together?
if
you've
got
an
exhaustion
rule,
then
embedded
in
it
is
always
a
procedural
default
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
a
comment
made
when
the
decision
itself
held
that
there
was
no
exhaustion.
the...
wasn't
that
so?
i
mean,
the
holding
in
madigan
was
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean
mccarthy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
was...
in
mccarthy,
itself,
the
wording
was
something
that...
of
the
kind
proposed.
and
so,
it's
not
clear
whether
it's
referring
to...
what
was
proposed
was
a
rule
that
would
incorporate
a
procedural
default
motion.
it's
not
clear,
just
from
the...
reading
that
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
thinking--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
what
congress
might
have
meant,
one
part
of
the
picture
is,
we're
not
dealing
with
statutes
of
limitations
enacted
by
legislatures.
we're
dealing
with
grievance
procedures
that
vary
from
state
to
state,
and
maybe
even
from
prison
to
prison.
and
some
of
them
have
a
very
short
span.
i
think
the
brief
said
some
of
them
are
2,
3,
5
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
you
just
one
thing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--about
how
this
operates
and
who
reviews
what?
one
of
the
claims
that
was
made...
this
prisoner
filed
twice.
and,
the
second
time,
as
i
recall,
he
said,
"every
day
that
i'm
here,
the
clock
starts
running
again,
because
this
is
a
continuing
violation.
"
"i'm
restricted
today,
and
i'll
be
restricted
tomorrow.
"
and
there
was
no...
is
that
something
that
would
be
reviewable
in
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--role
would
govern
whether
a
continuing
violation
occurred?
would
it
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
what
is
the
law
of
the
prison
grievance
proceeding
on
that
point?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
he...
that...
his
point
is
that
the
event
at
issue
happens
every
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your...
but
your
point...
your...
whatever
the
internal
grievance
procedure
is,
there's
no
judge
that
would
decide
that,
which
you
said,
this
is
all
for
the
internal
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feder--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
feder,
there
is
one
anomaly
that
the
government
points
out.
and
i...
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
know
what
your
answer
is.
they
said,
"imagine
one
prisoner
who
begins
the
grievance
process
on
time,
he
goes
to
step
two,
goes
to
step
three,
then
he
stops.
"
"and
then
another
prisoner
who
waits
til
the
time
has
come
and
gone,
she
files.
"
"the
prison
says,
'we
don't
take
late
filings.
"
"'
the
second
prisoner
gets
to
court,
and
the
first,
who
did
go
through
three
steps,
but
stopped
short
of
the
fourth,
doesn't
have
any
access
to
federal
court.
"
