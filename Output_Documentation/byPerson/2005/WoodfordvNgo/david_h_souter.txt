justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
that
really
is
an
inapposite
because
the
1983
proceeding
is
de
novo?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--plausible?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
do
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
there
was
prior
law
that
required...
i
forget
its
exact
words,
but
something
like
"reasonable
procedure",
and
that
language
was
repealed?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's...
if
that's
the
case,
then,
on
your
own
reasoning,
you
can't
assume
that
there's...
that
availability
requires
any
reasonable
availability.
it's
got
to
be
availability
as,
i
guess,
a
physical
possibility,
and
that's
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
find--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
plausible
that
congress,
in
effect,
would
have
intended
these...
the
statute
of
limitations
on
1983
to
be
truncated
in
that
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
abuse
was
not
coming
from
people
who
filed...
or
the...
let's
say
the
line
that
identifies
the
abuse
was
not
a
line
between
those
who
file
a
grievance
within
2
days
and
those
who
do
not.
i
mean,
that's...
that...
it's
true,
if
you...
if
you
have
a
2-hour
statute
of
limitations,
you're
going
to
keep
out
a
lot
of
cases,
but
it's
not
a
tool
that
is
particularly
suited
to
the
problem
that
congress
was
dealing
with,
which
is
frivolous
actions.
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
you
like
to
have
a
2-hour
time
limit?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
you'd
have
a
lot...
you
know,
a
lot
more
time
at
the
park.
[laughter]
