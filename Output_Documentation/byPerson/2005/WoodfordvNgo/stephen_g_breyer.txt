justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
saying
that
it's
special
here.
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
text,
the
language
talks...
is
almost
identical
to
the
language
that
was
in
cripa,
or
whatever
is...
you
know,
cripa.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
the
concatenation
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
think...
oh,
well,
i
guess
it
isn't...
unlike
iirira,
it
is
apparently
unknown.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was
a
predecessor
act,
and
the
predecessor
act
used
this
same
language,
just
about.
and
what
it
said
was,
"judge,
you
may
require
exhaustion
of
such
remedies
as
are
available.
"
and,
given
that
language,
nobody
thought
that
was
a
procedure
default
rule;
it
just
meant
the
judge,
if
there's
a
remedy
available,
can
say,
"prisoner,
go
do
it",
in
an
appropriate
case.
and
all
that
happened
here,
if
you
look
at
the
history,
is,
they
changed
the
"may"
to
a
"must".
and
all
the
people
that
wrote
in
were
writing
in
about
that.
nobody
dreamt,
nobody
said,
nothing
suggests,
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
bring
in
the
procedural
default
aspect
of
it.
and
there
would
have
been
a
lot
of
objections
if
they
had.
so,
that's
the
argument
the
other
way.
now,
i'd
like
to
know
what
do
you
have
at
all
that
overcomes
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
get
to
the
purposes,
you
quote
in
your
brief...
the
only
legislative
history
i
could
find
here...
you
said
that
congressman
lobiondo
referred
to
mccarthy,
which
you
find
relevant,
because
mccarthy
indicated
that
the
word
"exhaustion"
would
carry
along
with
it
a
procedural
default
rule.
so,
what
did
the
congressman
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh
huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh
huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
i
take
it
from
your
answer
he
didn't
really
say
anything
helpful
to
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--except
to
refer
to
the
name
of
the
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
which
case,
what
we
have
on
the...
all
right.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
wouldn't
it
go...
wouldn't
that
apply...
that
principle
apply
to
reasonable...
unreasonable
remedies?
you
have
to
have
a
reasonable
remedy.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
decide
to
import
half
of
administrative
law
and
not
the
other
half.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
just
a
filing
deadline.
it's
the
whole
procedure.
i
mean,
rehnquist...
chief
justice
rehnquist,
in
mccarthy,
lists
a
bunch
of
reasons
in
cases
where
the
process
subjects
the
plaintiffs
to
unreasonable
delay,
to
an
indefinite
timeframe.
and
there
could
be
others.
the
normal
thing
is,
you
excuse
exhaustion
where
the
exhaustion
requirement
was
such
that
the
person
couldn't
reasonably
comply.
now,
either
you
do
want
to
import
that
into
this
statute,
or
not.
and
if
you
do
not,
then
i
think
you're
asking
us
to
say
we
import
what
goes
normally
with
the
word
"exhaustion",
where
it
favors
the
government,
but
not
what
normally
goes
with
the
word
"exhaustion"
where
it
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
they
use
the
word
"until",
instead
of
the
word
"unless"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right,
but
the
thing
i
don't
understand
in
this,
which
is
hard...
is
there
any
answer
to
this
point
from
the
other
side?
what
this
statute
does
seem
to
be
about
is
exhaustion,
which
normally
does
carry
with
it
the
notion,
"if
you
don't
exhaust,
you
lose.
"
dozens
of
cases
say
that.
and
it
seems
to
make
it
a
requirement,
not
leaving
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
prisoner.
well,
your
interpretation
leaves
it
up
to
the
prisoner.
if
the
prisoner
doesn't
want
to
do
it,
he
doesn't
do
it.
he
pays
a
price,
he
has
to
wait,
but
it's
up
to
him.
now,
that's
the
point
that
is
bothering
me
the
most,
frankly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but,
i
mean,
that's
a...
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
verbal
gimmick,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
if
he
waits,
and
he
waits
to
past
the
deadline,
sure,
he'll
put
a
piece
of
paper
in,
but
it'll
be
denied.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
that
true?
so,
i'm
not
counting
he
puts
a
piece
of
paper
in,
and
it's...
in
my
way
of
speaking,
if
what's
left
for
him
to
do
in
the
system,
because
there
is
this
deadline,
6
months,
it's
passed,
it's
now
9
months,
so
he
says,
"here's
my
paper.
"
"i'm
exhausting.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
denied.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
i'd
say
that's...
means
he
isn't
exhausting.
he's
failed
to
exhaust,
as
i'm
using
the
term.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
want
to
get
rid
of
that
argument.
use
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--terminology--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
now
answer
what
i
am,
frankly,
bothered
by
the
most--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
what
i
just
said.
it
leaves
it
up
to
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
necessarily.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
that's
what
i
find
interesting.
it
might
be,
if
you're
representing
the
interests
of
defendants
here,
you'd
love
this
to
have
the
procedural
default
rule,
because
it
will
end
up
with
the
federal
judges
all
over
the
country
systematically
reviewing
the
exhaustion
procedures...
or
the...
yes,
the
remedies
in
the
prisons.
and
where
those
remedies
are
not
right
or
unfair
or
too
short
or
have
other
problems
with
them,
the
judges
will
say,
"you
can't
have
this
kind
of
remedy.
"
"if
you
want
me
to
apply
exhaustion
principles,
you
can't
do
it.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
therefore,
we'll
get
a
force
for
improvement.
and
that's,
i
thought,
maybe
why
nobody
wanted,
really,
to
bring
it
up.
