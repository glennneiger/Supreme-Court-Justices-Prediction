conceivably,
if
it's
too
short,
it's
not
reasonably
available.
i
guess--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
conceivable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would...
i
would
not
describe
"exhaustion"
that
way.
i
would...
i
would
describe
a
failure
to
file
within
the
prescribed
time,
not
as
an
exhaustion
of
remedies,
but
as
a
failure
to
exhaust
remedies.
i
mean,
i
guess
i'm
having
a
terminological
problem
in
this
case,
as
i
did
in
the
previous
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
we're
talking
about
administrative
law,
which
is
a
field
i
used
to
know
something
about,
and
i've
never
thought
"exhaustion"
included
"failure
to
exhaust",
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
happens
when
you
simply
don't
file
within
the
prescribed
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
how
does
it
do
that?
i
mean,
if
there's
any
object
that
congress
had
in
mind,
surely
it
was
to
reduce
the
number
of
frivolous
prisoner
claims
that
are
coming
into
federal
district
courts.
and
it
hoped
to
do
this
by
sending
the...
making
sure
that
they
went
through
the
prison
system
first.
whether
we
looked
at
what
the
prison
system
did
or
not,
we
hoped
that
the
prison
system
would
get
rid
of
a
large...
a
large
number
of
these
frivolous
claims.
now,
can
you
tell
me
how
that
purpose
is
possibly
served--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
saying,
"do
nothing.
"
"so
long
as
you
don't
even
try
to
go
through
the
prison
grievance
system,
you
can
come
directly
into
court.
"
it
seems
to
me
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
no,
"you...
you
have
to
go
there
late.
"
"you--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
"#
you
just
sit
around
until
it's
too
late,
file
a
grievance
that
you
know
will
not
be
accepted,
because
it's
too
late,
and
then
you
can
come
into
federal
court.
"
this
is
going
to
cut
back
considerably
on
the
number
of
frivolous
claims?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
because
they
thought
they
had
to
file
on
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
more
frivolous
the
case,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
it
won't
be
remembered
by
a
guard.
i
mean,
you
know,
the
suit
is,
"a
guard
spat
on
my
painting.
"
or
something
like
that,
you
know.
who's
going
to
remember
anything
like
that
4
months
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you're
understating
the
amount
of
time
that
he's
saving
by
failing
to
exhaust.
it's
not
just
if
he
waits
six
months
and
then
puts
it
in.
if
he
had
filed
within
the
right
period,
he
would
get
a
hearing
at
one
level.
and
there
may
be
as
many
as
two
other
levels
of
review
before
he's
fully
off...
before
he's
fully
exhausted.
now,
here's
a
guy
who...
you
know,
he's
lying
around
in
jail.
he's...
this
is
a
frivolous
filer.
he
wants
to
get
out
of
the
jail,
downtown,
you
know,
to
the
district
court
in
l.a.,
where
he
can
look
at
the
beautiful
people
and
relieve
the
humdrum
of
prison
life.
he
wants
to
get
to
district
court
as
soon
as
he
can.
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
that
procedural
rule
binding
on
him,
but
the
time
procedural
rule
not
binding
on
him?
i
don't
know
why.
i
mean,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they're
procedural
rules,
you
have
to
set
it
forth
in
a
comprehensible
manner,
and
you
have
to
be
on
time.
