we'll
hear
argument
next
in
georgia
versus
randolph.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
was
curious,
though,
which
way
that
fact
cut.
i
can
see
the
argument
that
the
closer
the
relationship,
the
more
reasonable
it
is
to
say
that
the
one
party
more
or
less
recognizes
that
their
privacy
interests
are
held
hostage
to
the
views
of
the
other.
it's
when
you
get
the
disrupted
relationship,
or
their
adverse
interests,
that
maybe
the
expectations
of
privacy,
or
the
reasonableness
of
one
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
other,
becomes
a
little
more
strained.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
telephone
call
between
a
husband
and
wife,
and
the
wife
tells
the
police,
"listen
in
on
this
call"?
she's
consented
to
the
monitoring
of
the
conversation,
the
husband
has
not.
maybe
he
even
begins
the
call
by
saying,
"i...
don't
let
anybody
else
listen
to
this.
"
it's
clear
that
that
is
admissible,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
she's
consenting.
it's
an
intrusion,
in
the
one
case,
on
the
conversation;
in
the
other
case,
on
the
home.
in
the
telephone
case,
it's
recognized,
in
the
law,
the
consent
of
one
party
subjects
the
other
to
having
the
conversation
monitored.
in
this
case,
the
consent
of
one
party
subjects
the
other
party
to
the
search.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--begs
the
question...
it
begs
the
question
to
say
"it's
a
distinct
individual
right
to
privacy.
"
it's
a
little
academic
to
talk
about
his
individual
right
to
privacy
when
he's
sharing
the
home
with
someone
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
all--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--reflects
is
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
was
just
going
to
say,
it
just
reflects
the
expectation
of
privacy.
and
when
you
do
live
with
someone
else,
you
compromise
your
individual
privacy
interest
to
that
extent.
we
know
that
you
compromise
it
to
the
extent
that
if
you
happen
not
to
be
there,
and
that
person
says,
"sure,
come
on
in
and
search.
"
that's
going
to
bind
you,
as
well.
why
is
it...
why
do
you
not
compromise
the
expectation
to
the
extent
of
giving
the
other
person
the
right
to
consent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
a
fair
reading
of
rodriguez.
there,
it
was,
"come
on
in,
he's
asleep.
"
it
was
quite
clear
that
if
he
were
awake,
he
was
going
to
say,
"don't
come
in".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
talk
about
that
tie.
your
approach
applies
in
the
case...
a
dormitory,
you
have
a
common
room,
there
are
ten
rooms
off
of
it,
nine
people
say,
"sure,
come
on
in
and
search.
"
and
the
one
person
says,
"no".
that
one
person
exercises
a
veto
over
a
search
of
the
common
area?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what...
well,
what
is
your
answer--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
that
case?
your
case
is
that,
if
one
out
of
ten
who
share
the
common
room
says
to
the
police,
"you
may
not
come
in",
that
controls?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
can
i
just
take
the
next
step
in
my
hypothetical?
the
wife
and
the
two
adult
children
who
live
in
the
home
say,
"come
on
in",
and
the
husband
says,
"no".
what
happens
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
reasonably,
the
person
realizes
he
would
be
outvoted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
it
does
go
to
his
presumably
objectively
reasonable
views
of
what
nature
of
privacy
he
has.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
if
he
thinks,
"look,
i've
been
having
a
bad
time
with
my
wife.
"
"i
think
she's
going
to
consent
and
let
the
police
in
if
i'm
not.
"
--then
his
objection
shouldn't
control?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
don't
have
the
same...
they
don't
have
the
same
property
interest
as
a
spouse
does,
as
a
tenant
in
common
or
whatever.
the
child
doesn't
have
that
interest
in
the
home.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
ms.
smith,
you
have
a
minute
and
a
half
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
