mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
court
should
hold
that
it
is
not
reasonable
for
officers
to
conduct
a
consent
search
when
a
person
with
an
equivalent
interest
in
the
premises
expressly
objects.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
although
not
on
the
theory
of
third
party
consent.
the
analog
to
your
hypothetical,
which
is
this
court's
decision
in
lopez,
is
justice
thomas'
reference
to
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire...
to
the
new
hampshire
case.
and
what
happens
there
is,
this...
mrs.
randolph
could
take
the
cocaine
and
give
it
to
the
officer.
she
was
participating
in
giving
an
item
to
them.
it
is
not
the
same,
i
think,
when
she
authorizes
the
police
to
conduct
a
generalized
search
of
the
premises.
it
would
be
as
if--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--but...
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
think
that
lopez
and
white,
in
that
line
of
cases,
established
that
other
things
that
people
do
consent
to
can
expose
us
to
intrusions
on
our
property.
what
i
think,
however,
is,
it
doesn't
follow
that
she
can
authorize
the...
them
to
conduct
a
generalized
search
of
the
premises.
it's
as
if
she
were
saying,
"you
can
listen
in
on"--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--"#
all
the
phone
calls"--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--"#
in
the
house".
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
you
do--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
souter.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--correct.
but,
justice
souter,
i
think
the
thing
that
is
important...
and
i
want
to
get
to
your
line
of
questioning
about
exactly
what
the
nature
of
the
state's
argument
is...
is
that
he
had
a
distinct
individual
right
to
privacy
at
the
core
of
the
home,
as
opposed
to,
for
example,
information
privacy.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
why
i
finished
off
on
that.
let
me
just
focus
on
the
important
part
of
my
statement.
and
that
is,
we
are
talking
about
a
search
of
the
home,
at
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
court's
doctrines
are
quite
different
about
situations
in
which
you
share
information
with
third
parties.
let
me
step
back
and
do
the
case
before
lopez,
and
then
explain
how
it
was
extended
to
lopez.
cases
like
white
say,
"if
you
give
information
to
someone
else,
you...
they
can
give
it
to
the
police
without
conducting
a
search
of
you.
"
this
is
a
very
different
situation.
the
police
are
clearly
conducting
a
search
of
a
premises
that
i
think,
justice
souter,
it
has
to
be
agreed,
he
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to.
now,
justice
souter,
it
is
absolutely
right
that
there
are
instances
in
which
people
have
expectations
of
privacy,
and
yet
searches
occur,
notwithstanding
those.
and
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
here
that
says,
"look,
he
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
but
the
police
came
in
for
a
different
reason.
"
that
would
be
true,
for
example,
if
there
was
a
warrant;
they
would
come
in,
notwithstanding
his
reasonable
expectation.
that
would
be
true
if
there
were
exigent
circumstances.
but
the
theory
of
consent
is
very
different.
schneckloth,
zap,
all
of
the
court's
precedents--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--good
guess.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
exactly--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
but
i
do
think
it's
important,
of
course,
this
court's
precedents
have
often
said
that
the
degree
of
the
expectation
informs
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
a
consent--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--search
is
reasonable.
reasonableness,
or
course,
is
a
balance--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
think
everybody
makes
their--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
i
think
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
the
point--
[laughter]
--is
that...
that
everybody
makes
some...
there
are
two
things.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
so,
he--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
because
she's
not
authorizing
a
search...
she
wants
them
to
come
in
and
talk
to
her,
wherever,
in
the
house...
that
might
be
a
different
case.
the
two
words--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
okay.
i
have,
and
i
can.
since
1974,
when
this
court
decided
matlock,
the
federal
and
state
courts,
combined,
have
considered
this
question.
and
so,
there
was
a
finding
of
evidence,
and
it
led
to
a
suppression
hearing.
that's
the
best
that
i
can
do.
fifteen
times,
all
the
federal
and
state
courts,
once
every
two
years.
it
is
the
case
that
in
that...
in...
last
year
alone,
there
were
200,000
domestic
disputes
that
were
reported.
but
that's
just
the
city
of
chicago.
what
we're
considering
here
is
the
situation
in
which
there
is
no
real
need
for
the
police
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
what
i'm--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--saying
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
your
honor,
the...
it
is
an
unresolved
question
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--this
court.
it's--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--equally
divided--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
all
right.
let
me
answer
this
on
several
different
levels.
first,
there
is
no
serious
argument
that
we
interfere
with
investigating
abuse
claims.
the
conversation
can
happen.
it
may
not
happen,
arguably,
in
a
place
that
he
has
a
right
to
privacy,
but
it
can
happen
outside.
it
happens
outside
all
the
time.
if
there
is
any
suggestion
that
a
reasonable
officer
would
believe
that
there
was
an
ongoing
crime,
there
was
abuse
going
on
right
then,
then
it's
clear
that
exigent
circumstances
would
authorize
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
i
am
not
an
expert
in
spousal
abuse;
and
so,
i'm
not...
which
i
think
is
a
very
serious
issue.
i
do
know
one
thing
about
my
rule,
and
that
is
that,
under
our
rule,
and
under
the
rule
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
articulated,
they
are
allowed
to
speak
with
her,
including
speaking
to
her
outside.
it's
true,
there
may
be
some
sacrifice.
and
you
have
identified
a
sacrifice.
and
that
is,
she
can't
take
them
into
a
room
in
which
he
has
a
constitutional
expectation
of
privacy.
i
will
concede
that
if
he
says,
"i
don't
want
you
in
the
bedroom.
"
that
will
be
a
sacrifice.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
no
serious
argument
that
they
can't
have
the
conversation
in
a
place
where
she
feels
secure.
that's
on
the
porch,
that's
in
a
police
car.
if
she
says,
"i
need
you
to
come
up.
"
and
there's
been
abuse,
then
what
would
have
happened
in
this
case...
let
me
explain
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
officers
asked
mr.
randolph
first.
he
said
no.
they
found
out...
had
found
out
from
her
that
there
was
drug
paraphernalia
on
the
premises.
what
they
had
to
do
in
order
to
conduct
this
search...
if
they
wanted
to
search,
rather
than
having
her
bring
the
materials
out...
is
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
get
a
telephonic
warrant,
which
would
have
taken
less
than
5
minutes.
the
real
reason
i
bring
to
your
attention
the
200,000
domestic
disturbances
is
that
what
you
should
be
concerned
about,
i
think,
is
not
the
15
cases,
which
is
not
a
serious
intrusion
on
law
enforcement
interests
over
30
years,
but
it's
the
many
times
in
which
our
family
relationships
ebb
and
flow.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
person...
the
fourth
amendment
is...
it's
not
the
person
who
has
the
drugs
or
the
abuser.
consent
searches
involve
a
situation
in
which
the
police
come
to
the
door,
and
they
say,
"can
we
search"?
because
they
do
as
much
as
they
are
permitted
to
do.
and
the
person
just
says,
"sure",
perhaps
completely
ignorant
of
her
rights.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
anything
is
going
on.
and
what
the
state's
position
is,
is
that,
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
the
home,
and
that
the
core
of
the
constitutional
right
to
privacy
in
the
text
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
that
the
only
thing
he
can
do
to
be
secure
in
the
language
of
the
constitution
is
not
live
with
someone
else.
remember,
the
theory--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
think
you've
put
your
finger
on
it.
and
i
just
want
to
say,
justice
souter,
that
i
do
think
that
the
other
side's
argument
inevitably
does
revolve
around
this
notion
of
an
expectation
of
privacy.
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
expectation
is...
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
minnesota
versus
carter...
that,
while
it's
technically
possible
that
the
people...
minnesota
versus
olson,
i'm
sorry...
the
people
that
we
live
with
will
admit
others
over
our
objection,
our
expectation
about
what...
about
what
will
happen,
our
reasonable
expectation,
is
different.
and
i
also
want
to
take--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
souter,
that's
why
i,
sort
of,
paused
and
came
to
you.
and
that
is,
i
do
think
that
the
other
side's
argument...
i
want
to
say
two
things.
one
is
that
it
inevitably
reduces
to
the
idea
that
we
have
a
lessened
expectation
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--privacy--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--but--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
souter,
i
think
it
is.
i
will
only
say,
in
my
defense,
that
their
brief
articulates
it
in
the
manner
that
i
was
describing
it,
i
think,
with
the
chief
justice.
but
let
me--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--let
me--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
all
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
all
right.
let
me
look
at
it
through
the
other
lens.
and
that
is
from
the
perspective
of
a
reasonable
police
officer.
i
think
there
are
two
points
to
make.
the
first
is,
i...
the
common
ground
between
the
sides
in
the
case
is,
you
look
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
person
who
arrives
at
the
house,
and
you
ask
what
is
reasonable.
and
if
someone
arrives
at
the
house,
it
is
a
different
matter
entirely
if,
as
in
matlock
or
in
rodriguez,
someone
says,
"come
on
in",
and
they...
you
believe
they
have
authority
over
the
premises,
versus
you
come
to
the
house
and
someone
with
authority
over
the
premises
says,
"come
on
in",
and
the
other
person
says,
"no,
stay
out".
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
has
argued
successfully
in
this
court
that
we
don't
make
any
assumptions
about
whether
people
will
consent
or
not.
there
are
innumerable
cases
in
the
lower
courts--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
justice
souter.
and
that
is,
the
government
has
argued,
and
this
court
has
accepted,
again...
and
this
is
a
different
point;
and
that
is,
you
have
to
have
a
clear
line
for
police
officers
that
is
administrable.
and
the
line
that
is
reflected
in
matlock
and
rodriguez
is,
if
you
get
consent
to
come
into
the
house
from
someone
who
has
the
common
authority
to
do
so,
that
will
be
sufficient,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
if
some...
and
so,
you
don't
have
to
go
around
and...
finding
other
people
and
asking
other
people.
it's
just
as
if
you
showed
up
at
a
house,
and
you
were
invited
in.
you
wouldn't
say,
"well,
let
me
check
with
everybody
else--
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--"#
who
lives
here".
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it's
true,
justice
souter,
there
are
a
lot
of
possible
clear
lines.
what
i'm
describing
to
you
is
why
the
difference
between
matlock
and
this
case
is
one
in
kind,
and
that
is
that
matlock,
i
think,
reflects
an
administrable
rule,
and
that
is,
if
you
do
have
permission
from
someone
who
has
the
authority
to
admit
you,
you
don't
have
to
go
ask
anybody
else.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
but
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
souter,
i
don't
think
they're
silly
cases.
i
think
that
it
is
an
important
rule
that
the
police
show
up
and
they
are
able
to
rely...
if
they
only
hear
from
one
person,
they're
able
to
rely
on
that
person.
i
don't...
the...
i'm
not
claiming
that
our
rule
has
great
administrative
advantages
over
the
other
side's.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
sacrifice
the
individual's
privacy
who
lives
in
the
house...
as
you
say,
has
an
expectation
of
privacy.
and
so,
let
me
return--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
i
think
that's
why
it's
important
that
our
rule
is
not
that
the
police
should
go
away.
we
call
for
a
balance
here,
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
the
court
has
precedent
on
this
very
point,
and
that
is...
and,
justice
souter,
he
is
asking
about
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy...
minnesota
versus
olson.
the
court
considered
this
and
said
the
very
reason
that
person
had
standing
and
could...
had
a
fourth
amendment
right
is
because
they
did
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
premises,
that,
even
though
they
had
no
property
rights
to
keep
any...
this
is
the
overnight
guest...
had
no
property
rights
to
keep
anybody
out
at
all,
their
expectation...
their
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
for
fourth
amendment
purposes...
is
that
if
somebody
wanted
to
come
in,
to
which
they
objected,
that
objection
would
be
honored.
now,
i
don't
want
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
our
position
is
the
balance;
and
that
is,
we
don't
tell
the
police
to
go
away.
we
say,
"look,
if
she
tells
you
that
there's
contraband
in
the
house,
she
can
bring
it
out.
"
that's
the
coolidge
case.
and
i
do
think,
justice
thomas,
that
there
is
a
difference
in
kind,
not
degree,
in
giving
something
to
someone
and
then
having...
versus
having
a
uncabined
search
of
a
house.
the
complaint--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
because
that's
not
a
search.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
thomas,
it's
how
it
played
out,
because
they
stopped
the
search
then,
because
she
withdrew
her
consent.
but
what
she
authorized
was
something
very
different.
she--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
justice
thomas,
that's
absolutely
correct.
my
point,
instead,
is
that
what
happened
here,
in
terms
of
the
consent,
and
what
the
state's
rule
of
law
would
authorize,
and
what
matlock
and
rodriguez
authorize
if
they're
extended
to
this
point,
is
not,
"take
me
to
the
drugs",
which
is
an
interesting
proposition,
but,
instead,
"go
ahead
and
search
the
whole
house.
"
so,
our
point,
justice
breyer
is,
"look,
don't
leave.
"
"get
a
telephonic
warrant.
"
"it
takes
5
minutes.
"
"if
you
know
there's
something
in
the
house,
bring
it
out.
"
"if
you
have
anything
to...
any
reason
to
believe
there's
ongoing
criminality,
seal
the
house.
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sorry.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that
it
does.
our
view
of
the
law
is
that
the
question
is,
when
the
property
rights
are...
and
their...
their
control
over
the
property,
i
should
say;
i
don't
mean
to
invoke
the
common
law...
when
the
control
over
the
property
is
equivalent,
then,
in
that
tie,
if
you
will,
the
fourth
amendment
controls.
if...
there
are
doctrines
designed
to
protect
against
situations
in
which
you
have
concerns
about
ongoing
criminality
and
protecting
people.
but
that's--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
straightforward
rule
that
i
have
argued
for
today
is
that
if
you
have
an
equivalent
interest
in
the
premises...
it
is,
of
course,
the
state's
rule
that,
if
nine
people
object,
matlock
says
that
any
one
of
them
can
let
them
in,
and
an
individual
can
override
the
objections
of
everybody
else
in
the
house.
what
i'm
saying,
i
think,
just
to
return
to
the
basics,
is,
i
do
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
don't
think
that
has
to
follow
from
our
rule.
it's
true,
we
have
articulated
one
broad
rule
that
would
allow
the
fourth
amendment
to
control,
but
i
think
if
we
analogize
to
the
social
situation...
if
you
said
to
yourself,
"what
do
you
expect
will
happen
if
nine
people
that
you
live
with
want
to
let
in
someone
and
you're
the
only
one
who's
going
to
object?
"
--i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
to
say
to...
that
individual
expects
the...
them
to
come
in.
justice
souter,
let
me
return...
i
want
to
make
sure
i--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
souter,
i
honestly
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think
that
illinois
versus
rodriguez,
on
this
question,
which
is
assessing
the
degree
of
the
authority
over
the
premises,
does
call
for
a
"totality
of
the
circumstances"
inquiry.
i
also
don't
know
that
i
fully
answered
your
point,
that
we
look
at
this
question
from
the
perspective
of
the
officer
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
and
let
me
just
say
that,
in
matlock
and
in
rodriguez,
the
court's
analysis
was
that
it's
reasonable,
because
the
person
whose
privacy
is
intruded
on
has
assumed
some
risk.
the
court
does
look
to
the
privacy
interests
of
the
person
who
is
ultimately
the
defendant.
that's
a...
an
element
of
the
reasonableness
inquiry.
and
our
point,
fundamentally,
is
that
it
cannot
be
the
case
that
when
the
framers
enacted
the
fourth
amendment
so
that
you
could
live
with
other
people
and
have
a
private
space
away
from
the
government,
that
you,
merely
by
living
with
your
family,
assume
the
risk
that
your
privacy
will
be
lost.
that
assumption
of
the
risk--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--on
our
broadest
rule,
the
husband
would
control,
although
it
doesn't
follow,
from
our...
that,
to
affirm
the
judgment,
you
have
to
say
that,
because
i
think
you
could
say
that,
reasonably,
the
person
realizes
they
would
be
outvoted.
but
i
do
think
the
children
is
an
important
point.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
and
what--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
when...
i
agree
with
you
objectively.
this
court
didn't,
for
example,
in
matlock
and
rodriguez,
look
at
the
particular
family
dynamics
at
that
time.
it
looks
to
broader
social
understandings.
i
did
want
to
return
to
your
"children"
point.
remember...
and
i
think
this
is
a
vital
point...
and
that
is,
the
courts
of
appeals
uniformly
conclude,
after
matlock
and
rodriguez,
that
children
are
residents,
which
is
the
inquiry
in
illinois
versus
rodriguez,
and
they
can
give
consent
to
search
a
home.
it
necessarily
follows
that
if
you
extend
that
rule,
matlock
and
rodriguez,
to
this
case,
that
children,
because
they
have
the
authority
to
admit
the
police...
minor
children,
12,
14,
15...
can
then
authorize
the
search,
notwithstanding
the
objection
of
the
parents.
now,
if
everyone
agrees,
"that
can't
be
right,
it's
the
parents'
home.
"
that's
because
we
are
assessing--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
that
question
hasn't
been
confronted
by
any
court
we've
checked.
but
what
i...
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
confronted
repeatedly,
and
uniformly
agree...
and
it's
in
our
brief...
is
that
children
satisfy
the
matlock
and
rodriguez--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--standard.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
right,
but,
of
course,
that's
not
the
inquiry
under
matlock
and
rodriguez.
if
we
take
your
point,
then
we
are
definitely
moving
beyond
matlock
and
rodriguez.
we're
going
to
have
to
look
to
more.
and
my
point
is
that,
if
we
do
look
to
more
than
simply
the
fact
that
the
officers
have
found
someone,
however
ignorant,
has
the
ability
to
consent
in
their
own
right,
if
we're
going
to
assess
the
other
factors,
the
rule
should
look...
the
court
should
look
to
what
the
ordinary
social
understandings
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the...
i
do
not
believe,
as
a
matter
of
doctrine,
that
it
does.
i
do
think,
however,
that
it
informs
this
court's
analysis
of
reasonableness,
in
the
sense
that
the
court,
in
schneckloth,
said,
"we
are
not
going
to
allow
consent
to
circumvent
the
requirements
of
getting
a
warrant.
"
and
it
is
the
case...
we
have
to
inescapably
agree,
i
think,
that
this
is
simply
a
way
of
getting
around
the
warrant
requirement.
they
wanted
to
find
out
something
about
him.
he
had
a
privacy
interest
in
the
premises.
he
said,
"no".
the
constitution
says,
"you
have
somebody
who's
cooperating
with
you.
"
"let
them
tell
you
what's
going
on
in
the
house.
"
and
illinois
versus
mcarthur
says,
"seal
off
the
premises".
in
fact,
illinois
versus
mcarthur
is...
the
very
point
of
the
court
in
that
case
was
that
it's
much
better
to
seal
the
premises
and
get
a
warrant,
which
will
define--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--oh,
justice--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--she
said,
"i
think
you
should"...
she
said--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
she
said,
"i
think
you
should
go
in
there
and
get
it.
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
but,
inescapably,
what's
going
on,
there
are...
i
think
that
this
is
not
a
case
that
follows,
necessarily,
from
matlock
and
rodriguez.
and
there
is
a
bright
line
to
be
drawn,
and
that
is,
you
are
going
to
have
to
not
live
with
your
family,
which
is
precisely
what
the
fourth
amendment
is
about,
in
order
not
to
assume
the
risk
of
the
police
coming
in.
the
reasonableness
determination
is
a
balancing
of
law
enforcement
and
privacy
interests.
the
privacy
interests
are
very
high.
the
police
can
easily
get
a
telephonic
warrant
or
have
the
materials
brought
out
to
them.
it
is
not
necessary
to
take
this
case,
when
so
rarely
has
it
been
that
the
police
have
needed
to
use
this
authority.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
