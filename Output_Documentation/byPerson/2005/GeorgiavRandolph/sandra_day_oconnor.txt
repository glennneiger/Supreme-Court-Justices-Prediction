do
we
look
to
what
is
socially
acceptable?
is
there
some
language
to
that
effect
in
some
of
our
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it
is
the
norm
that,
if
there
are
coinhabitants
of
a
house
or
apartment,
that
it's
okay
to
let
a
stranger
in,
against
the
express
wishes
of
your
spouse
or
coinhabitant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
that's
socially
acceptable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
might
be
common,
but
i'm
not
sure
that's
an
acceptable
kind
of
performance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
if
the
spouse
had
put
a
sign
up,
"no
police
allowed
here"?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
we
think
it
does?
because
that's
how
i
read
it,
too,
that
matlock
governs
where
one
of
the
people
is
absent.
and
we
have
a
situation
that's
different
here.
now
what
rule
do
we
look
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
when--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
the
husband
is
physically
present
and
says
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
do
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--think
the
officers
had
sufficient
grounds
to
get
a
warrant
here
for
a
search?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
issue.
is
it
valid
consent
when
the
coowner,
the
husband,
is
there
and
says,
"no,
you
don't"?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--go
ahead.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
have
not
decided
fourth
amendment
issues
on
the
basis
of
the
law
of
property,
have
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
we--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--have
to
look
at
social
understanding
on
right
to
privacy?
and
how
is
it
that
you
can
construe,
in
every
instance,
a
right
of
a
cotenant
to
override
the
express
objections
of
the
other
cotenant,
who's
there,
and
says
no?
how
can
you
say
that's
acceptable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
possible,
but
you
have
a
case
here
where
the
wife
says,
"come
in",
and
the
husband
is
right
there
and
says,
"no,
you
can't".
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yes,
but
there's
kind
of
an
assumption
there
that
if
the
cotenant
is
not
there,
sure,
you'll
let
the
tenant
who
is
there
call
the
shots.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would,
or
would
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
not
nothing,
because
we
have
cases
that
have
said,
if
the
coinhabitant
is
not
there,
he
relinquishes
whatever
right
he
had
to
object.
but
if
the
coinhabitant
is
there,
and
says
no,
what's
the
matter
with
giving
effect
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it's
by
happenstance
that
the
police
find
the
wife
in
the
house.
i
mean,
it's
six
of
one,
half
a
dozen
of
the
other.
it's
a
happenstance.
