may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
two
questions?
seems
to
me
you're...
if
we're
using
social
analogies
in
what
happens,
i
imagine
that
it
would
make
a
difference
if
the
person
who
wants
to...
who
was
invited
in
by
the
wife,
is
larger
or
smaller
than
the
husband.
[laughter]
and
i
think
he
probably
would
not
go
in
if
he
thought
he
was
a...
could
not
do
so--
--in
his
physical
encounter.
and
the
problem
with
your
case
here
is,
the
police
officer
is
always
larger
than
the
homeowner,
and
he
always
has
the
power
to
override
any
physical
objection.
so,
i
think
that
the...
the
actual
social
situation
will
vary
tremendously
from
different
facts
as
to
the
fair...
and
yet,
we're
looking
for
a
rule
that
applies
equally
across
the
board--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
second
question
i
want
you
to
address
at
the
same
time
is,
what
if
this
was
a
suitcase
that
they
both
owned?
they
stopped
in
the
airport.
the
wife
says,
"i
don't
want
you
to
open
it.
"
and
her
husband
says,
"go
ahead
and
open
it",
or
vice
versa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
matlock
is
the
reasonable
police...
well,
go
ahead.
i
shouldn't
interrupt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
"different
way",
of
course,
would
be
to
get
a
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would?
