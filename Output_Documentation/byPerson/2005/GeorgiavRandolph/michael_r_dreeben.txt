mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
law
of
consent
searches
is
governed
by
a
determination
of
what
is
reasonable
for
the
police
to
do
in
a
particular
circumstance,
and
it
starts
from
the
premise
that
consent
is
not
a
disfavored
species
in
the
law,
that
cooperation
with
law
enforcement
is
a
good
thing
and
should
be
encouraged.
the
right
of
the
cotenant,
in
this
case,
to
consent
stems
from
her
common
authority,
which
is
independent
of
his
and
allows
her
to
serve
valuable
social
interests,
as
well
as
interests
that
represents
her
own
personal
interest.
many
of
these
cases
arise
not
among
couples
who
are
harmonious,
but
among
couples
in
which
there
is
some
degree
of
tension,
and
the
spouse
who
consents
in
these
situations
has
an
independent
interest
in
ensuring
that
she
can
call
upon
the
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
the
law
in
this
area
is
founded
on
a
notion
of
agency.
it's
founded
on
a
notion
of
independent
authority
of
each
to
grant
access
to
the
police,
to
cooperate
with
law
enforcement
with
respect
to
premises
over
which
authority
is
shared.
and
in
a
case
like
this,
the
wife
has
an
independent
interest
in
disassociating
herself
from
criminal
activity
that
is
going
on,
on
the
premises.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
kennedy,
there
may
well
be
other
bases
to
allow
law
enforcement
activity
to
go
on,
but
that
presupposes
that
her
authority
to
consent
is
somehow
qualified,
if
the
police
could
obtain
a
warrant
or
some
other
doctrine,
would
it
support
the
search?
and
this
court
has
twice
rejected
exactly
that
approach
to
the
analysis
of
consent
searches.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
law
of
property,
justice
scalia,
to
the
extent
that
it's
relevant
here,
would
allow
any
cotenant
to
license
his
or
her
interest--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
quite
agree,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
uniform
social
understanding
that
should
drive
the
decision
in
this
case,
for
two
different
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
think,
in
many
circumstances,
two
people
who
share
property,
and
who
disagree
about
whether
a
guest
should
be
invited,
will
resolve
it
in
a
variety
of
different
ways.
somebody
might
let
in
a
commercial
visitor,
over
the
objection
of
a
cotenant,
or
someone--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
i
think
that
the
other
factor
that
the
court
needs
to
consider
in
evaluating
this
is
not
just
social
expectations
with
respect
to
non
law
enforcement
events
and
visitors,
but
this
positive,
affirmative
social
interest
in
encouraging
cooperation
with
the
law,
which
is
something
that
she
has
the
ability
to
do
with
respect
to
property
over
which
she
has
common
authority.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
what
the
court
needs
to
do
is
look
at
the
consent
search
doctrine
in
relation
to
third
party
consents,
generally.
matlock
makes
quite
clear
that
if
the
objecting...
potentially
objecting
party,
the
target
of
the
search,
does
not
voice
an
objection,
then
the
third
party
has
full
authority
to
allow
the
search,
even
if
they're--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that,
on
the
facts
of
either
matlock
or
rodriguez,
that
would
be
a
particularly
logical
or
reasonable
assumption.
in
matlock,
you're
dealing
with
a
man
who
was
arrested
for
bank
robbery
in
the
front
lawn
of
his
house,
the
police
take
him
to
a
police
car,
put
him
in
a
police
car,
do
not
ask
him
for
consent;
instead,
they
go
back
and
they
ask
the
woman,
with
whom
he
is
living
at
the
house,
for
consent
to
search.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
rodriguez
is
even
more
dramatic,
because,
in
rodriguez,
the
victim
of
a
battery,
gail
fischer,
seeks
out
the
police
and
says,
"i
want
you
to
arrest
rodriguez.
"
and
brings
him
to
the...
to...
the
police
to
the
apartment,
where
they
enter
and
arrest
rodriguez.
surely,
if
rodriguez
had
been
asked,
or
if
matlock
had
been
asked,
the
presumption
is,
they
would
have
objected.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--at--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
stevens,
the
second
one
is
the
easier
one.
the
same
rule
applies.
anyone
who
has
common
authority
over
the
suitcase
should
be
able
to
cooperate
with
law
enforcement
to
vindicate
both
the
social
interest
in
cooperating
with
a
law
enforcement
request
and
the
interests
of
the
person's
who's
making
it.
and
i
think
that
that's
what
matlock
is
all
about.
now,
as
for
the
attempt
to
mirror--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
attempt
to
transpose
ordinary
social
understandings
from
a
myriad
of
infinitely
varied
settings
that
do
not
involve
law
enforcement,
i
submit,
will
not
correctly
allow
this
court
to
calibrate
what
it
should
be
doing,
which
is
balancing
the
individual
interests
in
privacy
against
the
social
interests
that
affirmatively
encourage
and
validate
the
use
of
consent.
and
i
think
what
matlock
does,
to
put
this
case
in
context,
is
to
illustrate
that
if
the
police
had
waited
until
respondent
had
left
his
house
to
go
to
work,
or
to
go
to
court,
or
to
do
anything
else,
or
if
he
had
stayed
there
and
gone
to
sleep
at
night,
then
matlock
tells
us
that
she
would
have
full
authority
to
allow
the
police
into
the
house
to
conduct
a
search
of
common
areas.
and,
for
this
court
to
announce
a
rule
that
says,
no,
when
the
person
is
there
on
the
scene
and
vocalizes
an
objection,
which
we
can
reasonably
presume
that
he
would
have
if
he
was
given
the
opportunity
to
voice
it,
would
mean
that
police
simply
have
an
incentive
to
find
a
different
way
to
accomplish
the
same
end.
and
i
would
submit
that
that
does
not
give
adequate--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--an
option
would
be
to
get
a
warrant
in
cases
where
the
police
do
have
probable
cause,
but,
as
this
court
recognized
in
schneckloth
versus
bustamonte,
the
courts...
the
officers
will
not
always
have
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it
clearly
would,
justice
ginsburg.
and
the
facts
in
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
would
amount
to
probable
cause
if
the
wife,
who
has...
she's
in
a
position
where
she
would
know
what's
going
on
in
the
house,
what
kind
of
activity
is
going
on
in
the
house,
she
is
a
presumptively
reliable
citizen
providing
information
to
the
police,
and
the
fact--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that's
not
all
she
said,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
she
said
was
that
there
were
items
of
drug
evidence--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
the
house.
and
if
you
look
at
the
warrant
that
the
officers
obtained,
it
more
clearly
elaborates
that
she
said
there
were
drugs
and
paraphernalia.
but,
for
the
court's
purposes,
this
case
is
virtually
identical
to
illinois
versus
mcarthur
with
respect
to
the
probable
cause.
you
have
a
wife
and
a
husband
who
are
in
a
domestic
dispute,
and
the
wife
comes
out,
in
illinois
versus
mcarthur,
and
tells
the
officers,
you
know,
"he's
got
drugs
inside
there".
and
the
court
was
unanimous,
i
believe,
on
the
point
that
that
furnished
probable
cause.
but
what
is
different
from
illinois
versus
mcarthur,
and
this
case,
is
that
the
police
officers
have
the
consent
of
someone
who
reasonably
appears
to
them
to
have
common
authority,
someone
who's
living
in
the
marital
home,
someone
who
is
in
a
position
to
know
what's
going
on
and
exercise
her
own
independent
authority.
and
for
this
court
to
say,
"well,
there
are
alternatives"...
you
know,
the
police
could
pull
respondent
out
of
the
house
and
quarantine
it
while
they
go
get
a
warrant,
or
the
police
could
do
other
investigation,
or
they
could
rely
on
exigent
circumstances...
what
that
does
is
treats
her
consent
as
worth
nothing.
it
reduces
her--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it's
very
odd
to
say
that,
in
matlock,
the
right
was
relinquished,
when
matlock
was
arrested
and
taken
to
a
police
car
and
was
never
asked
for
consent,
or
that
rodriguez
relinquished
his
right
by
falling
asleep
in
his
own
apartment.
what
really...
i
would
qualify
my
statement,
though,
in
response
to
your
comment,
justice
o'connor.
it's
not
that
it
treats
it
as
nothing.
it
would
treat
her
consent
as
100
percent
valid
when
he's
asleep
or
absent,
no
matter
how
much
we
know
he
would
object,
and
it
would
treat
it
as
zero
when
he's
on
the
scene
and
vocalizes
an
objection.
and
i
think
that
that
would
protect
fourth
amendment
rights
only
by
happenstance,
or,
worse,
it
would
simply
be
an
invitation
to
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
in
this
case,
as
in
many
other
cases
involving
this
kind
of
potential
incident,
the
wife
called
the
police
to
the
scene.
so,
there
was
a
reason
for
them
to
be
on
the
scene.
it
was
a
perfectly
valid
investigatory
step.
and
once
they
acquired
the
information
relating
to
drugs
on
the
premises,
and
had
the
authority
of
someone
who's
in
charge
of
the
premises,
i
submit
that
the
police
should
be
able
to
conduct
the
search
as
a
reasonable
matter
under
the
fourth
amendment,
just
as
they
would
if
respondent
had
been
asleep
or
if
respondent
had
said,
"well,
i
have
to
go
now.
"
"am
i
free
to
go?
"
and
the
police
said
that,
"you
are".
and
i
don't
think
that
it
always
would
be
an
advantage
for
the
nonconsenting
tenant,
somebody
like
mr.
randolph,
to
insist
on
the
police
getting
a
warrant
or
conducting
a
probable
cause
arrest.
if
he's
arrested,
he's
taken
down
to
the
station,
he
has
a
search
incentive
to
arrest,
he
may
not
get
a
hearing
for
48
hours.
if
the
police
do
have
to
get
a
warrant,
they
are
entitled
to
search
anywhere
and
everywhere
in
the
premises;
whereas,
in
this
case,
one
of
respondent's
main
claims
is
that
she
wasn't
credible.
well,
if
she
wasn't
credible,
and
she
had
led
the
police
upstairs,
and
the
police
had
found
nothing,
that
might
have
been
the
end
of
the
whole
incident.
and
i
think
that
it's
because
of
the
socially
valuable
function
of
efficiently
resolving
accusations,
potentially
dueling
accusations
of
criminal
conduct
that
consent
searches
can
facilitate,
that
this
court
has
said
that
consent
searches
are
a
positive
social
good
and
should
be
encouraged,
rather
than
discouraged.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is,
in
effect,
the
same
thing.
and
i
think
that,
had
that
happened,
there
would
have
been
no
question
that,
assuming
that
the
police
reasonably
believed
that
she
had
authority
to
do
it,
and
possibly
even
if
they
didn't,
the
contraband
would
have
come
into
the
hands
of
law
enforcement,
and
there
is
really
no
reason,
or
doctrine
under
the
fourth
amendment,
to
deny
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
difference,
when
you
receive
something
with
the
consent
of
someone
who
has
the
authority
to
exercise
control
over
it,
is
a
question
of
whether
she
leads
the
police
upstairs,
or
whether
she
brings
the
item
downstairs.
and,
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
i
don't
see
a
difference.
thank
you.
