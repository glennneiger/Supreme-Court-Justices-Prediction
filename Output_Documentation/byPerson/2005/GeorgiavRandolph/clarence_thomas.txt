mr.
dreeben,
is
it...
is
this
case
materially
different
if
she
simply
ran
upstairs,
grabbed
the
straw,
brought
it
down,
and
handed
it
to
the
police
officer?
it's,
in
effect,
the
same
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
clarence
thomas
the...
but
this
was
not
an
uncabined
search.
that's
my
problem.
what
you're...
what
you're...
the
bottom,
you're
saying
to
us,
is
that
it's
not
unreasonable...
an
unreasonable
search
if
she
went
upstairs
and
brought
the
straw
down,
right?
justice
clarence
thomas
okay.
but
you're
saying
it
is
an
unreasonable
search
for
her
to
lead
the
police
officer
to
the
straw.
justice
clarence
thomas
which
is
what
she
did.
justice
clarence
thomas
but
she
withdrew
it
after
he
observed
the
straw.
