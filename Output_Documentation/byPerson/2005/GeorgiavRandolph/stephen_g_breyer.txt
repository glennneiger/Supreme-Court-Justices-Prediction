all
right.
well,
i...
the
words
that
keep
going
around
in
my
mind...
it's
her
house,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
she
wants
the
policeman
in.
so,
why
does
he
have
more
of
a
right
to
keep
the
policeman
out
than
she
has
to
have
the
policeman
in?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everybody
makes
some
sacrifices.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let's
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
need
for
this,
because
it's
the
other
thing
that's
on
my
mind.
the
two
words
that
came
into
my
mind
are
"spousal
abuse".
all
right?
i
would
say
maybe
there's
a
pretty
good
need
for
this.
the
husband's
beating
her
up.
and
there
isn't
evidence
of
that,
but
she's
sitting
in
the
kitchen
table,
and
the
neighbors
hear
something
odd,
and
they
call
the
police.
"we'd
better
look
into
it".
they
come
to
the
door.
she
says,
"um,
hmmm,
oh,
i'd
like,
officer,
for
you
to
just
come
upstairs
to
my
bedroom
for
a
minute.
"
is
there
any
neighbor,
friend,
or
policeman,
in
those
circumstances,
who
wouldn't
go?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no.
it's
the
question
of
the
rule.
i
haven't
seen
anything
on
your
side
that
would
advocate
a
rule
that
would
not
prevent
the
many,
many,
many,
i
believe...
i
am
not
an
expert...
ambiguous
cases
of
domestic
spousal
abuse
from
being
investigated
by
the
policeman.
and
maybe
you
can
tell
me
you've
looked
into
it
empirically
and
i'm
wrong,
and
that's
why
i'm
bringing
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but...
no,
i'm
not
getting
your
answer.
are
you
telling
me
that
it
is
the
law
in
chicago,
for
example,
that
if
a
policeman
responds
to
a
call,
a
call
of...
it's
ambiguous...
what
it
says
is,
"an
anonymous
caller
said
there's
an
odd
situation
next
door.
"
"will
you
check
out
2355
maple
street?
"
he
goes
there.
the
wife
looks
a
little
oddly
at
him,
but
they're
sitting
at
the
table,
and
she
says,
"officer,
i'd
like
you
to
come
upstairs
with
me.
"
the
husband
says
no.
are
you
saying
that
the
law
is
clear
in
chicago
that
the
policeman
can't
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
where--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
it
clear
that
the
policeman
cannot
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
thought
it
was
not
clear.
and,
therefore,
what
i'm
asking
you
for
is...
if
your
rule--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
are
200,000
cases
a
year
in
chicago,
alone.
i
think
that
there
might
be
many
ambiguous
cases.
so,
you
relieve
me
of
my
concern
that
if
you
win
this
case,
in
those
ambiguous
situations,
where
the
wife
wants
the
policeman
in,
and
she's
afraid
to
tell
him
why,
until
she
gets
him
up
to
the
room...
she
wants
him
in...
and
he,
now
under
your
rule,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
could
not
go
in.
and
i'm
telling
you,
quite
frankly,
that's
what
bothers
me
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
aren't
exigent
circumstances.
in
the
case
i'm
thinking
of,
i'm
thinking
of
what
i
call
"ambiguity",
and
there
are
many
such
cases,
i
believe,
of
spousal
abuse,
where
the
wife
is
intimidated.
now,
maybe
i'm
wrong
on
my
facts,
but
those
are
the
cases
i'm
worried
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
an
expectation
of
privacy.
i
have
a
lingering
question
here
i'd
like
to
get
your
view
on.
i
don't
know
what
the
expectation
is,
is
my
problem.
if
i
think
of
social...
i've
never
been
in
a
situation,
frankly,
where
one
person
said,
"stay
out",
and
the
other
said,
"come
in".
so,
i
don't
know
what
i'd
do.
if
i
imagine
myself
in
a
normal
social
situation,
i
think
probably,
if
i
am
the
typical
person,
which
may
or
may
not
be,
i--
[laughter]
--i
think
i'd
say,
"well,
you
know,
i
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
this.
"
if
it's
a
dinner
party,
forget
it.
but
if
i'm
in
a
situation
such
as
the
police
might
be
involved
in,
where
i
think
there
is
some
danger,
there
is
something
wrong
in
the
house,
there's
something
odd
about
it,
i
don't
think
the
average
person
would
just
say,
"i'm
going
away".
i
think
the
average
person
either
would
come
in,
or
he'd
say,
"i'll
come
in
for
a
while.
"
"i'm
going
to
call
the
police.
"
or
they're...
you
just
wouldn't
have
that
reaction,
"i
want
nothing
to
do
with
it.
"
that's
the
reaction,
you
know...
that's
a
bad
reaction,
when
you
want
nothing
to
do
with
a
dangerous
situation.
so,
i
think,
in
that
situation,
the
normal
reaction
would
be,
"i'm
going
in",
or,
"i'm
going
to
get
some
help.
"
or,
"i'm
going
to
get
a
friend.
"
so,
i
don't
know
you
do
have
expectations
of
that
kind,
in
those
situations,
though
you
might
with
a
dinner
party.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
want
you
to
address
the
question
of
how
the
legal
category
of
"reasonable
expectation
of
privacy"
fits
in
with
what
i
just
said,
where
i'm
assuming,
in
some
social
situations,
you
do
think
you'd
be
left
alone;
but,
in
the
typical
situation,
stretching
well
beyond,
but
certainly
including,
situations
of
danger
where
the
police
might
be
involved,
you
wouldn't
have
an
expectation
that
you
will
be
left
alone.
i
want
to
know
how
those
facts,
if
they
are
facts...
and
you
can
say
they
were
not...
fit
within
the
category
called
"reasonable
expectation
of
privacy".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
anybody
in
that
case
who...
since
i
wrote
it,
i
guess
i'm
supposed
to
know
it
in
detail,
but
i
don't--
[laughter]
--and
i
thought,
was...
there
was
no
one...
no
consent
there.
there
was
nobody
giving
consent,
was
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
go
back
and
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
reread
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh
huh.
