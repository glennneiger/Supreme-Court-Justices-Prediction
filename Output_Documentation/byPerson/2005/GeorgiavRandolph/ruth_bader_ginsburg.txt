justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
she
said
she
came
to
collect
her
belongings.
that
didn't
sound
like
she's
intending
to
stay
very
long.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
relevant
what
the
status
of
the
person
is?
someone
might
not
know...
the
police
might
not
know
that
someone
on
the
premises
is
a
temporary
visitor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
called--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
police,
didn't
she?
she
called
the
police
to
come.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
all
of
this
is
really
getting
pretty
far
from
what
i
think
is
really
the
key
question
in
the
case.
matlock
is
decided.
and
matlock
said...
it
referred
to
the
risk
that
a
joint
occupant
undertakes,
the
risk
of
inability
to
control
access
during
one's
absence.
so,
the
scene
in
matlock
is,
one
occupant
is
there,
the
other
is
absent;
and
the
one
who
was
absent
assumes
the
risk
that
the
one
who
was
there
will
exercise
control.
matlock
doesn't
speak
to
the
two
people
who
are
in
disagreement
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you
would
distinguish...
in
your
answer
to
justice
souter...
this
is...
this
is
a
lawyer.
one
room
in
the
house
is
devoted...
is
his
office.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
her
permission
wouldn't
extend
to
that
room,
would
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
they,
on...
in...
on
these
facts...
i
thought
not,
but
perhaps
i
was
wrong...
the...
when
the
police
come
to
the
house,
they
don't
suspect
anything
about
cocaine.
wife
then
accuses
husband
of
being
a
cocaine
user.
so,
that's
the
first
information
the
police
have.
could
they
get
a
warrant,
just
on
her
say
so?
in
fact,
they
got
the
straw
that
had
the
cocaine
residue
on
it.
they
went
to
the
magistrate
with
that
straw,
and
he
gave
them
a
warrant.
but
if
they
had
nothing
but
the
wife's
accusation,
"he...
he's
a
cocaine
user.
"
would
that
amount
to
probable
cause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
case
that
says
that,
that
the
child's
invitation
overrides
the
parents'
objection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
a
mother
in
law.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
your
time
is
almost
up,
but
i
want
to
know
if
you
place
any
weight
at
all
on
the
fact
that
the
husband
was
the
target
in
this
case.
the
target
said,
"no",
and
the
one
who
wasn't
under
suspicion
said,
"yes".
does
that
make
any
difference?
