ms.

k.

mr.--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
one
occupant
can
give
law
enforcement
valid
consent
to
search
the
common
areas
of
a
premises
shared
with
another,
even
though
another
occupant
is
present
and
objects
to
the
search.
the
state
of
georgia
submits
that
the
answer
to
this
case
is
a
resounding
yes.
it
is
reasonable
to
recognize
that
a
person
who
satisfies
matlock's
definition
of
common
authority...
that
is,
a
definition
that
is
not
based
upon
property
law
concepts,
but
one
who
has
mutual
use
of
property
by
virtue
of
having
joint
access
or
control
for
most
purposes...
can
give
consent
for
a
search
of
that
premises,
in
his
or
her
own
right.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
there
has
been
some
of
that
in
some
of
the
prior
cases,
your
honor,
that
you
do
look
to
social
norms.
you've
also
said--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
think
that
is--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
think
it
is...
i
think
it
is
common,
your
honor.
as
much
as
one
would
like
to
think--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
we
have
what
we
have
called
either
adduced
expectation
of
privacy
or
a
limited
expectation
of
privacy
or
what
we
called
a
shared
expectation
of
privacy,
by
making
the
decision,
long
before
police
appear
at
the
door,
to
share
this
premises
with
someone.
and
by--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--that
decision--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
don't
think
that,
even
as...
in...
one
could
ensure
that
the
spouse
would
honor
the
other
person's
wishes.
i
think
this
case
is
here
to
give
some
substance
to
the
recognition
in
matlock
of
the
ability
of
the
cotenant
to
consent,
in
his
or
her
own
right.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
i
think,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
question
of
fact,
under
the
circumstances,
to
see
whether
the
husband
has
exhibited
some
exclusive
use
of
that
drawer
or
whether
the
facts
would
demonstrate
that
she
puts
socks
in
there
for
him,
she
puts--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--notes
in
there--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--for
him--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--well,
i
think...
looking...
we
measure
what
is
reasonable
on
the
part
of
the
police
by
looking
to
what
they
know.
and
rodriguez
made
very
clear,
one
does...
a
policeman
doesn't
simply
accept
every
invitation
to
enter.
if
there's
some
ambiguity
or
some
uncertainty,
the
policeman
has
a
duty
to
inquire.
and,
i
think,
looking
into
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
is
a
good
example.
you
have
police
who
were
called
to
the
marital
home
of
mr.
and
mrs.
randolph.
it
arose
out
of
a
domestic
dispute,
because
mr.
randolph
had
absconded
with
the
couple's
child.
the
officer...
this
was
a
small
town...
the
officer
knew
mr.
randolph,
because
mr.
randolph
was
a
local
attorney.
the
officer
knew
that
ms....
who
the
wife
was.
and
he
knew
this
was
the
couple's
home.
when
he
got
there,
in
talking
with
the
wife...
mr.
randolph
was
off
with
the
child,
hasn't
returned
to
the
residence...
he
learned
that
they
had
been
having
some
problems,
but,
in
looking
at
the
two
conversations
that
ensued,
the
policeman
learned
that,
despite
the
problems,
she
was
back,
she
was
living
there.
there
was
no
separation.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
she
did
not...
she
did
not
relay
that
to
the
officer.
that
came
from
mr.
randolph,
in
his
testimony
at
the
suppression
hearing.
all--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--well,
your
honor...
and
i
think
that,
looking
at
the
tenor
of
the
conversations,
that
is
exactly
what
this
officer
ascertained.
he
knew
that
she
was
there,
they
had
been
living
there,
she
was
back,
she
had
been
on
a
visit.
she
did
not
tell
him
they
were
separated.
she
did
not
tell
him
she
was--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--only
there--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--she
called
the
police.
and
what
we
have,
more
importantly,
is
a
factfinding
by
the
trial
court
that
she,
in
fact,
had
common
authority
to
give
consent
to
search.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
no,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
i
think
there
has
been
some
question
raised
by
the
respondent,
in
his
brief,
trying
to
challenge
both
her
authority
over
the
actual
bedroom,
itself,
which
is
an
issue
that
wasn't
raised
below.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
and
there
had
been
an
argument
raised
in
the
appellate
court--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--about
whether
she
had
abandoned
the
property.
but
the
trial--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
as
to
not
addressing
the
spectral
situation.
but
i
would
disagree
that
matlock
simply
only
spoke
to
an
absent
nonconsenting
defendant.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
i
think
you
look
to
whether
she
has
common
authority
over
the
premises
in
his...
in
her
own
right.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
because,
first
of
all,
you
said,
in
rodriguez,
the
constitution
does
not
guarantee
that
a
search,
only
with
the
defendant's
consent,
will
occur.
your
honors
said
that--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--only
a
search
that--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--is
unreasonable--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--they
ultimately
did,
your
honor,
but
that
consideration
of
getting
a
warrant
was
also
at
play
in
matlock
and,
i
think,
in
rodriguez.
and
the
point
is,
if
one
has
valid
consent,
you
don't
have
to
get
a
warrant.
they--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
you...
we
come
back
to
the
fact
that
he
does
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
absolute
or
unequivocal
control--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
its
ability...
if
we're
going
to
have
consent,
and
if
we're
going
to
have
a
third
party
consent
rule,
then
this
is
an
issue
that
is
going
to
have
to
be
resolved.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
i'm--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
well,
i
think,
in
the
morning
case
that
was
cited
in
the
brief,
they
realized
one
can
always
hope
that
the
other
will
accede
to
one's
wishes.
but,
this
is
the
dynamics
of
personal
behavior,
and
i
think
it
comes
from
an
almost
subliminal
assertion
that
the
person
who
was
saying
no
does,
in
fact,
have
absolute
authority
over--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--that
shared--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--premises.
and
that's--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--that's
out
of
sync--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--he
was...
it...
he
was
silent.
he
had
been
arrested--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--on
the
scene--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--well,
in...
and
even
in
that
situation,
matlock,
the
reference
to
the
absent
nonconsenting
defendant
was
in
a
paragraph
where
the
court
had
talked
about
how
it
had
reserved,
in
amos...
the
amos
case...
the
question
of
whether
a
wife
could
waive
her
husband's
rights.
and
then
you
had
decided
the
frazier
case,
and
that
was
what
was
described
as
the
nonconsenting
absent
codefendant
in
which
two
cousins
had
shared
the
use
of
a
dufflebag,
and
the
defendant
had
left
the
dufflebag
with
the
cousin.
the
cousin
and
his
mother
gave
consent
for
the
search.
and
it
simply
was
not
that
the
defendant
was
not
present,
but
this
court
found
there
was
mutual
use
of
that
bag
that
gave
the
cousin
the
authority
to
consent.
and
then,
the
court
readily
rejected
frazier's
arguments
that,
"well,
the
cousin
could
only
use
one
compartment
of
the
dufflebag.
"
and
you
said
you
wouldn't
get
into
such
metaphysical
distinctions.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
but--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
think,
your
honor,
we
had
called
it
a--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--a
reduced--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--yes,
your
honor--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--that
is.
and
i
think,
looking
at
justice
stevens'
dissent
in
rodriguez,
there
is
that
recognition
of,
when
you
make
the
decision
to
share
premises
with
another,
you
have
lost
the
expectation
of
exclusive
or
absolute
control--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
i
think
that
his...
his
expectation
is
unreasonable.
and
we
would
urge
the
court
not
to
adopt
that
and
enshrine
that
as
the
rule
for
fourth
amendment,
third
party
searches.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
save
the
remainder--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
i
think
it
would...
it
would
have
presented
a
much
closer
question
of...
and
particularly
given
the
protection
of
papers
and
the
fact
that
you
may
have
business
papers
in
there
with
attorney
client
privilege...
i
think
her
authority
to
consent
it
would
have
presented
a
closer
question,
although
it
would
still
be
something
to
look
at
under
totality
of
circumstances.
she
might
have
operated
as
a
paralegal.
she
might
have
been
his
secretary.
she
might
have
known
where
he
stashed
his
cocaine
under
a
particular
file.
but
that's
not
the
question
we
have
in
this
case.
we're
talking
about
common
areas
of
a
marital
home
over
which
both
have
equal
access
and
control.
and
we
would
urge
this
court
to
recognize
that
she,
with
common
authority
over
those
premises,
has
the
ability
to
admit
police
and
give
consent
for
search,
in
her
own
right.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
no
rebuttal,
your
honor.
