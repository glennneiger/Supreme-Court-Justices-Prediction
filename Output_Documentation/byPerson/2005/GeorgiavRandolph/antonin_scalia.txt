why--
justice

scalia
--why
not?
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
talking
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--reasonable
expectations,
i
suppose,
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
assume
that
it...
that
it
is
the
reasonable
expectation
of
two
people
who
have...
who
are
living
together
in...
on...
in
common
premises,
that,
where
one
of
them
wants
somebody
to
come
in,
and
the
other
one
does
not
want
somebody
to
come
in,
the
person
may
come
in?
i
would
think
that
the
normal
assumption
is
just
the
opposite,
that,
where
one
wants
somebody
excluded,
that
person
will
be
excluded.

justice
antonin

--in
matlock,
did
the...
did
the
absent
person
say
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
even
have,
in
matlock,
a
situation
where
you
know
that
one
of
the
parties
didn't
want
entry.
you
don't
know
that.
you...
there
was
one
party
there,
and
that
party
said,
"okay,
come
in".
and
the
other
party
said,
"well,
if
i
had
been
consulted,
i
would
have
said
no.
"
or
whatever.
but--
justice

mr.
dreeben,
does
this
authority
to
let
someone
in,
over
the
objection
of
the
cohabitant,
apply
only
to
policemen,
or
is
it...
is
it
also
the
case
that...
i
don't
know,
as
a
matter
of,
what,
property
law,
or
whatever
+/?
that
when
two
people
have
common
ownership
of
a
piece
of
land
or
a
house
or
whatever,
and
one
of
them
says,
"i
don't
want
a
certain
party
to
come
on.
"
the
tie
always
goes
to
the
other
party,
who
says,
"i
do
want
somebody
to
come
on.
"
is
that...
is
there
any
cases
that
establish
that
proposition?
it
seems
to
me
an
odd
proposition.
i
would
have
thought
the
opposite.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
she
said
is,
"he's
a
cocaine
user".
does
that...
does
that...
does
that
give
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
are...
you
know,
that
there's
contraband
on
the
premises
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
vice
versa.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
on.
