justice
david
h.
souter
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
is
that
a...
is
there
any
issue
about
that
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
i
thought
the
issue
was
whether
his
statement,
in
effect,
vetoed
whatever...
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
whatever
permission
might
have
been
given.
but,
as
i...
i
understood
that
there
was
no
question...
what
is
it
+/?
under
rodriguez,
at
least...
of
her
authority,
facially
to
admit
the
police
to
the
places
that
they
went.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
ms.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--ms.
smith,
may
i...
your
time
is
getting
short,
and
i
want
to
get
clear
on
one
thing.
as
i
understand
it,
your
argument
is
not
an
argument
that
the
husband,
in
this
case,
lost
an
expectation
of
privacy.
you
are
not
arguing
that
he
has
no
right
to
object.
am
i
correct
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
let
me--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
that
is
correct,
then
your
whole
argument
rests
on
the
fact
that,
although
he
has,
and
may
assert,
an
expectation
of
privacy,
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
right
of
his
wife
to
let
people,
including
the
police,
come
into
an
area
which
is
under
her
control,
as
well
as
his.
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
expectation...
this
is
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at...
your
expectation
is
not
what
governs.
you
concede,
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
still
had
an
expectation,
in
the
sense
that
he
could
assert
a
right
of
privacy,
he
can
litigate
this
case,
he
has
standing--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
that
his
expectation
is
irrelevant
to
the
fact
that
the
wife,
in
this
case,
we
assume,
had
the
right
to
admit
them
to
an
area
which
was
under
her
control,
as
well
as
his.
is...
have
i
got
it
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
was...
it
was
the...
it
was
a
search
only
of
premises
with
respect
to
which
she
had,
supposedly,
common
rights.
i
mean,
we
take
the
case
on
that
assumption.
justice
david
h.
souter
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
she
and
her
husband,
you
know...
if
she
had
a
right
to
be
in
only
two
rooms,
she
couldn't
authorize
the
search
of
the
whole
house,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
then
he--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
he--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
it...
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
where
you're
going.
we
agree
that
he
had
a
reason...
everybody
agrees,
i
guess,
that
he
has
a
reasonable
expectation.
he
can...
he
can
raise
his
fourth
amendment
claim.
your
argument
is
that,
even
though
we
get
past
the
reasonable
expectation,
there's
a
second
reasonableness
question,
and
that
is,
is
the
search,
itself,
reasonable?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
the
focus
of
your
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
olson
was
a
standing
case.
olson
was
not
confronting
this
situation.
in
olson,
the
police
simply
went
in
without
a
warrant.
and
the
argument
was
made
that
this
person
was
not
the
normal
inhabitant
of
the...
what
was
he?
a
houseguest
or
something
of
the
sort.
and
the
only
issue
that
olson
addressed
was
his
right
to
raise
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
it
did
not
respond
to
the
issue
that
you
are
raising,
which
is
the
reasonable
extent
of
search.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
don't
see
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
concede...
the
only
expectation
of
privacy
you've
got
to
have
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
in
order
to
raise
a
claim
is
a
minimal
one...
they
concede
that
the...
that
this
individual
has
an
expectation
of
privacy
sufficient
to
raise
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
their
argument
is
that,
although
he
can
raise
it,
the
rights,
however
they
may
be
derived
on
the
part
of
his
wife,
allowed
her
to
admit
the
police...
in
effect,
thwarting
his
expectations.
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
when
the
police
search
with
that
kind
of
permission,
over
his
objection,
it's
not
a
reasonable
search.
isn't
that
the
way
to
structure
the
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i...
i
agree
with
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is
this
talk
about
lessened--
justice
david
h.
souter
--expectation,
and
i...
i
think,
ultimately,
that's
irrelevant.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now
what's
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
maybe
we
don't,
but
isn't
there...
isn't
the...
isn't
mr.
dreeben's
argument
fair
that
no
one
in
his
right
mind
would
have
expected
matlock
to
agree
to
this?
it
is
clear
that
matlock,
had
he
known
what
was
going
on...
and
he
may
have;
i
don't
know...
would
have
objected?
so
that
if
we
accept
your
argument
that
the
presence
of
the
person
there
expressing
an
objection
is
what
makes
the
difference,
then
matlock
and
rodriguez
become
almost
silly
cases.
they
are...
they
are...
they're
cases
that
rest
upon
an
assumption
that
is
clearly
contrary
to
fact.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--an
equally
clear
line
would
simply
be
that,
if
the
area
to
be
searched
is
one
of
common
tenancy
or
occupation
or
whatnot,
the
only
consent
that
will
suffice
will
be
the
consent
of
the
person
against
whom
you
expect
to
use
any
evidence
found.
easy
clear
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
an
equally
administrable
rule
here
is
that,
even
though
the
person
you
suspect
objects,
you
can
still
go
in,
if
a
person
with
authority
otherwise
says
you
can.
equally
clear
rule,
and
it
has
one
advantage,
it
does
not
turn
matlock
and
rodriguez
into
silly
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
i...
you
assume
we
got...
there
goes
the...
that...
there
goes
any
bright
line
administrable
rule,
i
guess.

04-1067,
georgia
v.
randolph.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
police
responded
to
a
call
to
go
to
the
home
of
scott
and
janet
randolph,
where
janet
told
the
police
that
there
was
evidence
of
scott’s
drug
use
inside.
scott
refused
permission
to
search
the
house,
but
janet
consented.
she
led
an
officer
to
a
bedroom,
where
he
observed
a
straw
with
powdery
residue
he
suspected
was
cocaine.
the
officer
collected
the
straw.
scott
was
later
convicted
of
possession
of
cocaine
after
his
motion
to
suppress
that
evidence
was
denied.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
that
the
evidence
had
been
illegally
seized
and
should
have
been
suppressed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
split
of
authority
on
whether
a
physically
present
co-occupant’s
stated
refusal
to
permit
entry
renders
a
warrantless
search
invalid
as
to
him,
despite
a
co-occupant’s
consent.
we
hold
that
the
co-occupant’s
refusal
is
effective
and
so
affirm
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
in
united
states
v.
matlock,
we
held
that
a
consent
to
search
by
one
who
possesses
common
authority
over
premises
is
valid
as
against
an
absent
nonconsenting
person
with
whom
that
authority
is
shared.
we
explained
there
that
the
common
authority
is
not
synonymous
with
a
property
interest,
but
instead
is,
in
significant
part,
a
function
of
commonly
held
understandings
about
the
authority
that
co-inhabitants
may
exercise
in
ways
that
affect
each
other’s
interests.
it
is
fair
to
say
that
a
caller
standing
at
the
door
of
a
shared
premises
would
typically
not
go
inside
despite
one
co-occupant’s
invitation
if
the
other
occupant
stood
there
saying,
“stay
out”.
the
visitor’s
reticence
would
reflect
the
common
understanding
that
one
co-tenant
generally
has
no
right
to
prevail
over
the
express
wishes
of
another,
an
understanding
which
is,
in
fact,
borne
out
in
property
law.
since
the
co-tenant
wishing
to
open
the
door
to
a
third
party
thus
has
no
recognized
authority
in
law
or
social
practice
to
prevail
over
a
present
and
objecting
co-tenant.
his
disputed
invitation
without
more
gives
a
police
officer
no
better
claim
to
reasonableness
in
entering
than
the
officer
would
have
had
in
the
absence
of
any
consent
at
all.
accordingly,
in
the
balancing
of
competing
individual
and
government
interests
entailed
by
the
bar
to
unreasonable
searches,
disputed
permission
is
no
match
for
the
objecting
individual’s
claim
to
the
centuries-old
principle
of
respect
for
the
inviolability
of
the
home.
it
is
true
that
the
consenting
tenant
may
have
an
interest
in
bringing
criminal
activity
to
light
and
in
deflecting
suspicion
from
himself,
but
he
may
aid
police
in
ways
other
than
giving
them
entry:
he
may
retrieve
evidence
for
the
police,
for
example,
and
the
information
he
provides
may
be
used
by
police
in
getting
a
warrant;
and
if
it
appears
that
the
consenting
co-tenant
is
the
victim
of
domestic
violence,
the
police
may
enter
not
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
a
search,
but
for
the
purpose
of
providing
protection.
nothing
in
social
custom
or
its
reflection
in
private
law
argues
for
placing
a
higher
value
on
delving
into
private
premises
to
search
for
evidence
than
on
requiring
clear
justification
before
the
government
searches
private
living
quarters
over
a
resident’s
objection.
we
therefore
hold
that
a
warrantless
search
for
evidence
in
a
shared
dwelling
over
the
express
refusal
of
consent
by
a
physically
present
resident
cannot
be
justified
as
reasonable
as
to
him
on
the
basis
of
consent
given
to
the
police
by
another
resident.
