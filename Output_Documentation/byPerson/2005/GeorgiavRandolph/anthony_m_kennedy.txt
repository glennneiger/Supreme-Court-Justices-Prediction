what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
about
the
extent
of
the
search?
can
the
wife
say,
"it's
okay
for
you
to
come
in,
and
you
can
look
in
my
husband's
top
drawer?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
how
does
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--how
does
the
policeman--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so,
how
is
the
policeman
supposed
to
know
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
guess
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
depends
on
what
we
say.
i'm,
frankly,
still
somewhat
surprised
at
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
indicating
that
it
happens
all
the
time
where
there
are
two
occupants,
and
one
expressly
says,
"you
can't
come
in",
and
they
do
anyway.
but
leaving
that
aside,
it
seems
to
me
that
most
of
the
considerations
that
would
impel
a
decision
in
your
favor
can
be
answered
under
other
doctrines.
if
there's
cocaine
that's
being
used
and
may
be
destroyed,
there's
exigent
circumstances.
i
don't
see
the
necessity
for
the
rule
that
you
propose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
she
can
do
that
by
advising
the
police,
and
then
there's
probable
cause.
or,
if
the
husband's
there,
there
are
probably
exigent
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
well,
you
keep
saying
that,
but
that
policy
is...
can
be
vindicated
by
using
doctrines
other
than
consent.
and
you
want
us
to...
i
think
you
want
us
to
say,
i
think
we
have
to
say,
that
there's
a
general
social
expectation
that
the
person
who
wants
entry
overrides
the
person
who
doesn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
also
agree
with
justice
scalia,
that
social
expectation
may
be,
in
part,
measured
by
our
cases
on
this
subject.
and
i
just
don't
see
how,
if
it's
against
the
interest
of
an
occupant
to
allow
entry,
that
that...
that
that
interest
must,
necessarily,
be
overridden.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
take
the
position
that
there's
no
legal
difference
between,
(a)
entering
a
home
and
taking
something,
and,
(b)
receiving
it
on
the
outside?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
any
reason
to
believe--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
can't
enter
without
probable
cause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
a...
with
exigent
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
have
suspicions
of
a
domestic
problem
that's
ongoing.
it's
short
of
probable
cause,
but
you
have
reasonable
suspicion.
does
that
alter
the
nonconsenting
party's
interest
and
elevate
the
consenting
party's
interest?
