justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
product,
here?
i
mean,
if
they
had
not...
if
they
had
not
entered,
they
would
not
have
gotten
their
evidence.
their
entry,
because
it
violated
knock
and
announce,
was
unlawful.
so,
it
is
a
product,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
an
entry
that
conformed
with
knock
and
announce
would
have
been
lawful.
this
entry
didn't.
this
entry
was
unreasonable.
so,
i
don't
see
how
your
argument
fits
the
facts.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
how
do
you
make
that
distinction?
i
mean,
it's
like
the...
you
know,
the
cheshire
cat
and
a...
and
the
smile;
you
can't
distinguish
the
two.
there
was
one
entry,
and
that
entry
violated
the
knock
and
announce
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
basically,
your
argument
rests
on
the
fact
that
we
can
draw
a
distinction
between
entry
and
manner
of
entry.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
the
purpose
of
knock
and
announce
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that,
except
in
cases
in
which
the
people
inside
the
house
are
not
dressed,
or
cases
in
which
there
is,
in
fact,
a
gun
battle
of
some
sort,
that
a
knock
and
announce
violation
will,
in
fact,
never
be
the
cause
of
any
damage
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
it...
no,
but
it'll
never
be
the
cause
of
any
compensable
damage
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
i
take
it
your
argument
is
what
you
can
recover
from
requires
causation.
and
what
i
mean
by
"causation"
is
the
causation
of
the
harms
which
the
rule
is
intended
to
avoid.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
the
only
harms
that
the
rule
is
intended
to
avoid
is
the
exposure
of
nakedness
and
violence,
once
inside,
and
there
are
cases
without
nakedness
or
without
violence,
then,
in
those
cases,
there
will
never
be
a
recovery.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
basically,
your
rule
is,
the
police
are
entitled
to
take
the
chance.
if
they...
if
they
get
inside,
and
people
have
got
their
clothes
on
and
there's
no
gun
battle,
no
problem;
nothing
that
the
police
are
exposed
to,
either
by
an
exclusionary
rule
or
by
a
civil
recovery.
and
if
they
want
to
take
that
chance,
if
they
want
to
take
the
chance
that
somebody
will
not
be
dressed
or
a
gun
will
be
pulled,
basically
that's
their
option.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
going
to
say,
what
was...
what
were
the
grounds
upon
which
the
warrant,
in
segura,
was
obtained?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
it
didn't...
it
didn't
depend
on
the
entry
or
anything
gained
as
a
result
of
the
entry,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right,
but
the
warrant--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
warrant...
the
warrant
itself
didn't
depend
on
anything
they
had
gained
as
a
result
of
the
entry.
there
was
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--kind
of
causal--
justice
david
h.
souter
--continuum
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
that
the
difference,
though,
with
this
case?
because,
here,
there
is
a
causal
continuum,
at
least,
as
justice
breyer
said,
a
but
for
causal
continuum.
they
wouldn't
have
been
in
the
apartment
but
for
the
entry.
and
so,
the
authority
of
the
warrant
and
the
manner
of
executing
the
warrant
are
not
divisible
the
way
they
were
in
segura.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
in
segura,
the
court
issuing
the
subsequent
warrant
says,
"you
can...
you
can
go
in
there
and
do
this.
"
the
court...
by
the
way,
i...
maybe
this
makes
it
even
easier...
did
the
court,
in
secuga,
know
that
they
were
in
the
apartment?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--wait
a
minute.
what
is
this
incentive
inherent
in
the
circumstances?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
doesn't
seem
to
work.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
you've
got...
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
officer
testifies,
"it
never
works,
i
always
go
in.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
when
is
it
going--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
what
reason
do
we
have
to
believe
that
this
incentive
inherent
in
circumstances
is
ever
going
to
work
in
the
absence
of
an
exclusionary
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
they--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
don't
they
have
something
to
gain?
if
they're
right
that
there
is
evidence
inside,
they
gain.
they're...
i
mean,
they're
perfectly
rational--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
this.
they
gain
a
greater
chance
of
getting
that
evidence
than
if
they
let
a
few
seconds
elapse
and
the
evidence
can
be
flushed
away.
justice
david
h.
souter
for--
justice
david
h.
souter
--for
which
there
is
no
record
of
any
recovery
in
any
court
in
the
united
states,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
even...
even
if
michigan
doesn't,
i
mean,
that
has
nothing...
as
i
understand
it,
that...
that
doesn't
affect
the...
the
answer
to
the
federal
question
that
we
have
because,
as
i
understand
it,
we...
we
can...
we
can
take
as
good
law
that
even
with
a
warrant
that
does
not
have
a
no
knock
authorization,
if
the
police
have
a
justification
for
going
in
without
knocking,
so
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned,
the
search
is
still
good.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what
we're
really
arguing
is
what...
what
is
michigan
law
on
the
subject,
but
the...
the
issue
we've
got
is
not
michigan
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you...
you
concede
that
there
was
error
in
execution
here?
you
concede
that
there
was
a
violation
because...
technically
because
there
was
no
knock?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
concede
that?
you've
got
a
case
in
which,
as
i
understand
it,
not
only
was
the
evidence
but
the
warrant
itself
an
indication
not
only
that
drugs
were
present,
but
that
guns
were
present.
it's
perfectly
true
we
don't
have
a
general
rule
that
anytime
you
do
a
drug
search,
you
can
do
a
no
knock,
but
in
this
case
you
had
specific
evidence
that
there
were
firearms
there.
and
based
on
what
i've
seen
in
the
case,
i
don't
know
why
michigan
did
not
argue
that,
in
fact,
it
was
justified
to
go
in
without
knocking.
and
i'll
be
candid
to
say
you...
to
tell
you
that
the
fact
that
michigan
does
not
make
that
argument
suggests
to
me
that
michigan
is
trying
to
structure
a
case
in
which
it's
going
to
have
the
best
shot
to...
to
get
the
exclusionary
rule
out
of
the
way
here.
why
don't
you
claim
that
the
search
was
lawful?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
richards
precluded
a
general
rule,
but
it
didn't
preclude
you
from
arguing
in
a
specific
case,
and
it's
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
and,
hence,
all
the
way
up
the
line
to
you
do
not
argue
that
is...
is
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
think
we
have
to
revisit
richards.
i...
i
think
what...
what
i'm...
what
i'm
concerned
is
that
you
don't
make
an
argument
based
on
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
were
going
to
be
guns
facing
you
when...
when
you
went
in
the
door
and
therefore
the
knock
was
not
required.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
suggesting...
did...
did
the
warrant...
i
don't
know
this.
i
should
but
i
don't.
did
the
warrant
authorize
seizure
of
guns
as
well
as--
justice
david
h.
souter
--drugs?
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the...
the
gun
portion
of
the
authorization
was,
in
fact,
invalid?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
so...
in
any
case,
at...
at
the
moment
that
you
got
the
warrant,
you...
you
had,
in
fact,
a...
a
finding
by
a
trial
court,
or
a...
whoever
the
issuing
magistrate
was,
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
you
were
going
to
confront
guns
as
well
as
drugs
inside.
and...
and
richards
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
a
good
reason,
under
those
circumstances,
to
concede
that
you
didn't
have
a
basis
for...
for
dispensing
with
the
knock.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
was
specific
knowledge
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
got
a...
you
got
a
warrant--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
said
look
for
them.
that's
about
as
specific
as
you
can
get.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
do
you
dispute...
your...
your
brother
on
the
other
side
said
in
his
argument
that
he
had
not
heard
a
dispute
about
this.
but
do
you
dispute
his
claim
that
there
has
never
been
any...
at
least
in
recent
history,
any...
any
civil
judgment
actually
rendered
against
anyone
in
the
officer's
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
don't...
we
don't
have
any
indication
that
there's
an
effective
deterrence
then
in
civil
suits.
maybe
there
will
be
some
day,
but
we
haven't
seen
it
yet
in
michigan,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
may
mean
that...
that
potential
plaintiffs
say
if
the
courts
are
winking
at
this
in
the
criminal
case,
we
don't
have
much
chance
of
getting
a...
a
verdict
in
a
civil
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
don't
know,
but
that
might
be
the
case
too,
mightn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't...
isn't
the
problem
that
in...
in
fact,
it's
the
product
of
both?
the
warrant
alone
does
not
get
the
police
officer
into...
into
the
building.
it...
it
is
in
fact
the
entry
that
gets
the
police
officer
into
the
building,
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
the
judge
has
to
do
something.
the
police
officer
has
to
do
something.
and
the
question
that
i
think
we
face
when
we
say
is
the
later
search
the
product
of
the
entry,
is...
is
what
your...
what...
i
think
a
point
that...
that
counsel
on
the
other
side
was
making.
it's
a
pragmatic
point.
where
do
we
draw
the
line
of
causation?
and
his
answer
is...
and
i
think
the...
the
answer
of
the
cases
that
justice
breyer
was...
was
referring
to...
is
this.
we
draw
it
in
a
way
that
will
allow
us
to
deter
illegal
police
conduct,
and
if
we
engage
in
this
slicing
process
of
causation
that
you
talk
about,
there
will
be
no
deterrent
for
the
violation
of
the
no
knock
rule.
if
instead
we
say,
yes,
this
is
enough
the
product
that
we
ought
to
deter...
that
we
ought
to...
to
respond
to
it
in
a
way
that
will
deter
the
no
knock
and
therefore
we
find
causation
and
we
get
deterrence.
what
is
fallacious
about
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
do
that
every
single
time
we
exclude
a
piece
of
evidence
in
every
suppression
case,
don't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
don't...
don't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what...
what
do
you
say
to
justice
breyer's
argument
that
we
haven't
previously
analyzed
suppression
by
tracing
or
trying
to
trace
the
causal
connection
between
a
particular
piece
of
evidence
and
a
particular
reason
for
the
rule
that
was
broken?
what
we
have
said
in
the
past
is
if
the
rule
or
the
standard
is
violated
and
the
search
is
therefore
unreasonable,
the
evidence
doesn't
come
in.
you're
proposing
a...
a
different
causal
analysis.
you're
proposing
a
causal
analysis
that
requires
the
connection
between
a
piece
of
evidence
and
the
particular
reason
for
one
of
these
standards
in
every
case
in
which
suppression
is...
is
requested.
number
one,
do
you
agree
that
that...
that
would
be
a
departure,
as
justice
breyer
suggested?
and
number
two,
what
would
be
the
justification
for
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
does
relate
to
the
privacy
interests,
and
we've
seen
the
explanation.
one
of
the
reasons
for
requiring
the
knock
is
that
there
is
enough
respect
for
a
person's
home,
a
person's
privacy
to
say
the
police
should
not
barge
in
like
an
invading
army.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
a
respect
for
privacy.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
is
involved...
and
that
is...
that
is
the
whole
point
of...
of
knock
and
announce,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
talking
about
the
privacy
of
individual
in
his
home,
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
depends
upon
the
reasonableness
of
invading
the
individual's
privacy
in
his
home.
is
that
not
the
general
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
there
will
never
be
a
suppression
of...
of
evidence
specified
in
a
warrant
when
the
warrant's
no
knock
component
is
violated--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
we...
we
will
say...
in
every
single
time,
following
your
argument,
you
will...
we
will
say
the...
the
violation
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
authorization
to
seize
the
evidence.
the
violation
simply
had
to
do
with
the...
with
the...
the
niceties
and
the
risks
involved
in
entering.
so
if
we
accept
your
argument,
no
knock
is...
is
a
dead
duck,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
apparently
you're
saying
we
would
not
suppress
because
as
long
as
the
warrant
specified
the
items
to
be
seized
and
they
didn't
go
beyond
that,
there
was
no
causal
connection
between
the
fact
that
they
broke
in
and
disturbed
people
in
the
night,
when
they
were
not
authorized
to,
and
their
ultimate
obtaining
of...
of
the
evidence.
once
again,
it
seems
to
me
if
we
follow
your...
your
reasoning,
then
the
distinction
between
the
nighttime
and
the
daytime
warrant
is
a
dead
letter.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
constitution
requires--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
constitution
requires
a
reasonable
search.
it
is
hornbook
law
that
violating
no
knock,
violating
nighttime
searches
when
only
a
daytime
search
is
authorized
amounts
to
an
unreasonable
search.
you're
saying
that's
utterly
irrelevant
because
there's
no
causal
connection
between
that
violation
and
the
seizure
of
the
particular
items
that
the
warrant...
the
warrant
specified.
