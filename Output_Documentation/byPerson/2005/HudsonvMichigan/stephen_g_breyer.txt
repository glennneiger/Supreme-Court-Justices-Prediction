justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's...
that's
actually
what's
disturbing
me
about
this,
because
i
thought
the
knock
and
announce
rule
was
a
rule
that
would
allow
a
policeman
to
go
in
without
knocking
and
announcing
when
he
has
reasonable
grounds
for
thinking
he
might
get
shot
if
he
didn't.
so,
i...
as
i
read
the
briefs,
i
thought
maybe
that's
not
how
it's
being
implemented,
that
the
policemen
are
supposed
to
run
the
risk
of
being
shot.
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
situation.
so,
i'd
appreciate
your
explaining
that
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
be
sufficient
if
the
officer
says,
"one,
this
is
a
drug
gang;
two,
they
don't
let
people
into
the
house
whom
they
don't
know;
and,
three,
they
have
guns?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
is
that
different
from
saying
the
entry
is
lawful,
its
only
problem
is,
it
was
done
without
a
warrant?
i
mean,
you
know,
he's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--inside
the
building;
just,
unfortunately,
the
means
wasn't
right.
no
warrant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
means
wasn't
right.
no
knock
and
announce.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
they
had
a
bazooka--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
same
would
be
true
if
what
they
had
was
a
bazooka,
and
blew
the
house
up.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
see
your
argument
now.
i
think
your
argument
is,
most
of
the
fourth
amendment
rules
are
really
designed
to
prevent
warrantless
entries.
but
this
one
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
one
is
designed
to
prevent
damage
to
property--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--et
cetera.
so,
let's
not
have
the
exclusionary
rule
and
rely
on
the
damage
remedy
where
that
kind
of
thing
actually
occurs,
which
isn't
often.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
we
buy
that
principle,
suppose
we
were
to
apply
it
in
the
miranda
area...
purpose
of
a
miranda
warning
is
really
to
make
certain
he
can
have
a
lawyer,
if
he
wants
one,
for
example.
so,
now
we
prove
this
guy
wouldn't
have
asked
for
a
lawyer
anyway.
all
the
evidence
comes
in.
i
mean,
it's
an
interesting
principle.
i
see
the
logic.
but
it
seems
to
me
to
have
a
lot
of
implications
that
this
court
has
never
bought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can't
think
of
any
other
area,
fifth
or
fourth,
where
we've
bought
it.
and
i've
tried
to
explain,
in
the
question,
why
we
haven't
bought
it.
now,
you
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
depends,
of
course,
on
whether
you...
what
you're
doing.
now
i
see
what
you're
doing.
you're
applying
a
kind
of
palsgraf
causation
analysis
within
the
risk...
i
think
that's
what
you're
doing...
to
saying
it's
outside,
it's
not
a
cause.
you're
saying...
you
don't
say
it's
not
a
necessary
condition
of
his
being
there.
it
is.
you
do
say,
"well,
the
being
in
the
room
there
is
not
within
the
risk,
the
reason
for
which
we
have
a
knock
and
announce
rule.
"
but,
of
course,
that's
a
matter
of
judgment.
i
mean,
you
could
say
the
purpose
of
the
cause...
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule
is
to
keep
people
out
of
there
without
knocking
and
announcing.
and
if
that's
the
purpose
of
it,
it's
right
within
the
risk,
right
cause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
just
are
looking
at
the
harms
that
his
being
there
in
that
room
without
announcing
might
bring
about.
that
doesn't
mean
that's
why
we
don't
have
the
rule.
we
have
the
rule
to
keep
him
out
of
there
without
announcing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
you
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
difference
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
look,
this...
you
know,
i'd
appreciate
your
explaining
this...
this
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
in
your
brief
was
the
inevitable
discovery.
the
inevitable
discovery
rule,
in
my...
the
way...
the
way
i've
thought
of
it,
and
i'd
like
you
to
correct
me
if
i
haven't
thought
of
it
correctly...
to
use
a
kind
of
analogy,
it's
like
a
primitive
tribe
that
beats
a
tomtom
every
morning
so
the
sun
comes
up.
hey,
the
sun's
going
to
come
up
anyway,
and
the
bodies
are
going
to
be
discovered
anyway,
in
those
cases.
and,
in
segura,
the
warrant
is
going
to
be
issued
anyway.
so,
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
it
would
have
been
issued
if
they
had
behaved
properly,
it's
a
question
of
what
will
really
happen
in
the
absence
of
the
illegality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
what
i
thought
inevitable
discovery
here
was,
and,
in
the
absence
of
these
people
entering
the
apartment
illegally,
they
wouldn't
have
found
a
thing,
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
was
nothing
else
in
motion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
which--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--case
is
contrary
to
what
i
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
segura?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
just
said--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that,
in
segura,
they
would
have
gotten
in,
anyway,
under
a
legal
warrant
that
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
illegal
entry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
sun
rose,
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
"would
have".
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry.
i
have
laryngitis.
can
you
hear
me
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
retroactive
validation?
i
would
have
thought
segura
and
those
cases
are
silverthorne
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that
it
is
is
it's
an
independent
chain
of
events.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
an
independent
chain
of
events
that
almost
certainly
would
have
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
despite...
not
without...
despite
the
unlawful
entry.
and
if
that's
so,
all
we
have
is
a...
is
a
set
of
cases
where
deterrence
is
most
unlikely
to
play
any
significant
role
because
no
policeman
could
possibly
counter
that
kind
of
thing
getting
the
evidence
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
now
you're
talking
about
other
cases
in
other
courts.
i
looked
through
with
my
law
clerks
300
cases
since
weeks,
not
mapp,
weeks.
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
1914.
i
couldn't
find
in
300
cases
one
single
supreme
court
case
that
did
not
suppress
evidence
where
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation
with
one
exception.
the
exception
is
there
are
sets
of
cases
where
deterrence
is
really
not
a
factor.
for
example,
good
faith;
for
example,
it
isn't
going
into
a
criminal
proceeding.
okay?
now,
what
i'd
like
you
to
do
is
to
tell
me
if
i
missed
some,
which
is
certainly
possible,
or
second,
if
you
want
us
to
change
the
rule
and
go
back
300
years
or
300
cases
back
before
1914,
or
are
you
going
to
tell
us
that
deterrence
doesn't
play
a
role
here
or
whatever
you
want?
i
want
to
put
to
you
the
state
of
the
art
as
far
as
i
can
see
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there's
a
causal
connection
absolutely
here.
it
is
a
but
for
connection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
person
being
in
the
room
and
a
child
of
2
would
know
that
if
you
get
into
a
room,
as
a
result
of
your
being
in
that
room,
you're
likely
to
find
evidence.
so
it's
both
but
for
and
it
fits
within
the
problem.
there
we
are.
that's
the
same,
by
the
way,
as
it
is
with
making
a
false
oath
to
a
magistrate.
you
make
a
false
oath
to
a
magistrate.
that
permits
the
magistrate
to
get
into
the
house
with...
the
policeman
gets
in
there
with
a
warrant.
it
doesn't
take
the
court
long
to
suppress
that.
about
a
second.
and...
and
how...
how
is
this
somehow
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
he
read
segura.
we
read
segura,
which
happens
to
be
a
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
is
not...
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--important
exception.
the
exception
which
comes
from
silverthorne
is
when
there
is
an
independent
chain
of
events
such
that
it
will
be...
not
could
be,
but
would
be...
in
fact,
discovered
anyway,
despite
the
unlawfulness...
silverthorne...
holmes
says,
of
course,
you
don't
keep
it
out
then
because
that's
not
going
to
impact
deterrence.
now,
that's
segura.
that's
silverthorne.
that's
case
after
case.
of
course,
i
accept
that.
and
if
you
can
show
that
this
case
somehow
fits
within
that
chain,
fine.
then
i...
then
i
maybe
appear
i
have
my
mind
made
up
on
this,
but
i'm
open
to
change.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
that's...
i...
i
understand
that
point
from
your
brief
and
i'm
glad
that
you
brought
it
up.
but
i
have
never...
i
have
never
seen
fourth
amendment
matters
cut
that
finely.
i
have
never
seen
the
courts
say
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
reason
why
this
policeman
is
unlawfully
in
the
room
and
then
try
to
connect
each
piece
of
evidence
with
that
reason.
rather,
they
ask
is
he
unreasonably
and
unconstitutionally
in
the
room.
so
my
concern
about
that,
which
i'd
like
you
to
address,
is
if
we
took
that
approach,
i
think
we'd
be
doing
it
for
the
first
time,
and
we'd
let
a
kind
of
computer
virus
loose
in
the
fourth
amendment.
i
don't
know
what
the
implications
of
that
are.
i
can't
tell
you
what
you're
saying
is
illogical.
it's
not
illogical.
it's
conceivable,
but
it
strikes
me
as
risky
and
unprecedented.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
common,
when
you
have
a
chain
of
causal
connection,
to
say
it
ends
somewhere.
it's
common,
and
in
harris,
it
ended
once
they
left
the
home
and
now
they're
over
in
the
station.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
isn't
over
in
the
station.
this
is
in
the
home.
you
speak
of
interests,
but
this
doesn't
interests.
what
about
boyd?
i
mean,
the
most
famous
statement
in
fourth
amendment
history
to
all
invasions
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
its
employees
of
the
sanctity
of
a
man's
home
and
the
privacies
of
life.
it
is
not
the
breaking
of
his
doors
and
the
rummaging
of
his
drawers
that
constitutes
the
essence
of
the
offense.
but
it
is
the
invasion
of
his
indivisible
right
of
personal
security,
personal
liberty,
and
private
property.
now,
i
thought...
1886...
that's
what's
governed
these
cases
for
about
100...
and
far
more,
a
century
and
a
half
or
a
quarter.
and...
and
the...
then
suddenly
you
say,
well,
it's
this
interest
in
the
one
or
the
other
one.
i
mean,
doesn't
that
describe
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct?
i'm
sorry.
that
is
correct?
i...
i
thought
that
this
warrant
does
not
say
you
can
enter
the
house
without
knocking.
i
mean,
i
have
a
warrant.
this
warrant
lets
me
search
the
house
in
daytime.
i
search
it
in
nighttime.
is
my
search
authorized?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
a
warrant--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what...
what
happens
with
my
example?
i'm
curious.
that's
not
a
rhetorical
question.
i
have
a
warrant
which
says,
search
1618
5th
street.
i
search
1518
5th
street.
was
it
a
warrant...
a
warrant
back
search?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
have
a
warrant
to
search
1518.
i
don't
have
a
warrant
that
allows
me
to
come
in
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
it
says
day,
and
i
don't
have
a
warrant
here
that
allows
me
to
come
in
without
knocking.
so
where's
the
warrant?
