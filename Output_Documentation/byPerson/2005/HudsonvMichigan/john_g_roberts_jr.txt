chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
in
hudson
versus
michigan.
mr.
moran.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't...
you
don't
dispute
the
application
of
the
inevitable
discovery
principle
here,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
don't
dispute
that
the
purpose
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule
is
not
to
allow
the
targets
of
the
search
to
dispose
of
evidence,
or
anything
of
that
sort.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
a
limited
privacy
right,
of
course.
these
people
have
a
warrant,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
how
would
you
describe
the
privacy
interest
that
the
knock
and
announce
rule
is
protecting?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
it
doesn't
go
at
all
to
the
items
that
are
the
target
of
the
warrant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so,
why
should
the
remedy
for
the
violation
be
to
exclude
those
items?
the
privacy
that's
protected
isn't
the
cocaine,
the
weapons,
the
other
items
that
were
discovered.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
to
protect
privacy
in
the
possessions
and
papers
and
effects.
and
these
are
possessions,
papers,
and
effects.
it
goes
right
to
what
the
police
are
trying
to
seize,
and
you
have
an
independent
magistrate
make
a
determination
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
it,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
the
knock
and
announce
rule
is
an
entirely...
concerned
with
entirely
different
things.
and
yet,
you're
enforcing
it
by
excluding
the
papers,
effects,
and
possessions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
mean,
if
you
had
a
case
where
the
reason
you
were
arresting
the
guy
is
because
he's
shot
through
the
door
the
last
three
times
somebody
knocked
and
announced,
you
still
have
to
knock
and
announce,
under
michigan
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he
couldn't
get
a
warrant
saying
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
can't
get
a
warrant
that
says
he
can
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have...
do
you
have
any
empirical
basis
for
your
statement
that
many
warrants
are
executed
and
they
don't
find
anything?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
any
basis
for
your
statement
that,
in
a
large
number,
they
don't
find
what
they're...
anything
that
they're
looking
for?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
moran.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
baughman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
a...
it's
a
strong
argument,
on
the
other
side,
that
if
we
adopt
your
position,
the
officers
would
have
no
incentive,
other
than
their
own
judgment
about
their
personal
safety,
whether
to
comply
with
the
knock
and
announce
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
they
get
to
make...
do
they
get
to
make
"inevitable"
arguments
on
their
side?
i
mean,
let's
say,
as
what
happened
here,
or
as
seemingly
happened,
the
fellow
is
found
near
the
chair
with
the
drugs.
can't
they
argue,
"well,
if
you
had
knocked
and
you
had
waited
10
seconds,
he
would
have
gotten
up
from
the
chair
and
gone
somewhere
else?
"
and
you
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
argue,
at
trial,
"he
was
sitting
in
the
chair
with
the
drugs.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
was
something
in
the
chair,
right?
i
mean,
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
gun,
or
what--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--hmm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
tell
the
jury,
"i
was
standing
next
to
the
chair,
because
if
i
had...
i
obviously
would
have
gotten
away
from
the
chair,
because
i
knew
that's
where
the
gun
was.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
true.
i
mean,
there
are
going
to
be
situations,
or
at
least
possible,
where
evidence
is
going
to
be
a...
causally
connected
to
a
violation
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule,
right?
the
situation...
the
warrant
is
because
these
people
were
involved
in
a
shootout
with
the...
you
know,
the
johnson
gang;
they
knock
the
door
down
and
somebody
yells,
"look
out,
it's
the
johnson
gang.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
they
had
knocked
and
announced,
and
"it's
the
police",
they
wouldn't
have
that
statement
that's
incriminating.
now,
you
would
agree
that
that
statement
would
be
excluded
because
of
the
violation,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
salmons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
moran,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
isn't
the...
isn't
the
reason
it's
consonant
is
because,
in
those
cases,
there
is
a...
the
connection,
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
rule
that
was
violated
and
the
evidence
that
was
seized?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
not
the
general
privacy
of
the
home,
because
you
don't
dispute
that
if
he
had
waited
an
additional
4
seconds,
he
could
have
entered
the
home
and
executed
the
warrant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
reargument
this
morning
in
hudson
v.
michigan.
mr.
moran.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
wouldn't
it
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
it's
protected
the
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
entry
as
opposed
to
unreasonable
search
and
seizure?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
moran,
how...
how
long
do
you
think
the
officers
had
to
wait
before
they
could
have
entered?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
would...
if
they
had
done
that,
what
would
have
been
different
from
what
happened
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
do
you
presume
that?
someone
sitting
in
a
chair
with
gun...
with
a
gun
and
the
drugs
you
say
would
have
gotten
up
and
said,
oh,
it's
the
police.
let's
see
what
they
want?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
a
good
sign
of
what
might
have
happened
what
actually
happened
when
the
police
came
in,
which
was
there
was
an
effort
to
hide
the
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought...
where...
where
were
the
drugs
found?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
was
the
gun
found?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
chair?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
reason
to
suppose
that
if
the
officers
had
waited
15
seconds
instead
of
the
3
to
4,
that
they
wouldn't
have
found
the
same
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
only...
the
only
reason
they
wouldn't
have
found
the
same
evidence,
i
take
it,
is
if
they...
if...
if
the
defendants
had
had
additional
time
to
dispose
of
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
true.
there
are
cases
where
the
violation
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule
gives
rise
to
evidence
that
may
be
admitted
and
that
would
presumably
be
excluded
if
you
can
show
that
the
seizure
is
related
to
the
violation.
the
problem
here
is
that
the
evidence
that
is
being
suppressed,
as...
as
you've
suggested,
that
there's
no
question
that
it
would
have
been
available
if
the
officers
had
waited
15
seconds
as
opposed
to
4
seconds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
solicitor
general
hypothesized
one
in
the
amicus
briefs.
if
somebody...
you
know,
they...
they
burst
in
and
someone
screams,
you
know,
run
away,
it's
the
police,
that
excited
utterance
caused
by
the
absence
of
a
knock
and
announce
would
presumably
be
related
to
the
violation
and
could
be
suppressed.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
gun
and
the
drugs
that
are
found
in
the
room
is
in
the
same
category.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
it
is
is
recognizing
that
if
there
is
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
act,
it
is
suppressed
so
that
there
is
a
cost
to
the
illegal
act.
what
it's
saying
is
that
not
everything
that
happens
after
the
illegal
act
is
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
a
particularized
showing
of
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
vaguely
recalling
cases
from
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
d.c.
circuit
that
accepted
a
presumption
that
if
there
are
drugs
around,
there
are
likely
to
be
firearms
around.
are
you
saying
that
that's
inconsistent
with
the
richards
decision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
those
doctrines
that
you're
talking
about
would
be
overridden
on
the
hypothetical
that
you
want
us
to
be
concerned
about.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
if
you
don't
suppress
the
evidence,
there's
going
to
be
no
incentive
to
comply
with
the
law.
so
they're
going
to
deliberately
violate
the
law.
well,
if
they're
deliberately
violating
the
law,
qualified
immunity
isn't
going
to
help
them
very
much.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
moran.
mr.
baughman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
an
example
where
there's
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
is
brought
up
and
yet
suppression
is
not
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
baughman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
salmons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
no
doubt
in
here
that
an
invasion
of
the
home
was
authorized
by
the
warrant.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
interest
we're
talking
about
is
not
the
sanctity
of
the
drawers.
it
is
10
seconds
that
the
officers
should
have
waited
additionally,
according
to
the...
to
your
brother.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
salmons.
mr.
moran,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
there...
you
think
there
was
a
violation
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule
in
this
case.
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
two
cases?
if
they
illegally
entered
and
they
suddenly
said
we
waited
4
seconds,
it
was
supposed
to
be
15.
they
say,
never
mind.
they
go
back
out.
there's
another
knock.
they
wait
15
and
they
come
in.
then
it's
all
right.
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
but
you're
saying
it's
a
world
of
difference
if,
when
they
go
in
and
enter
and
they
say,
we
should
have
waited
10
more
seconds,
we're
the
police,
we're
here
to
execute
a
search
warrant,
let's
count
to
10,
then
all
of
a
sudden,
it's
invalid
from
there
on.
those
are
the...
they're
two
different
cases
in
your
mind?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion

04-1360,
hudson
versus
michigan.
