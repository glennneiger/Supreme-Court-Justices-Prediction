may
i
ask
you
whether
there
are
statutes
in
various
states
that
allow
an
officer
to
get
a
no
knock
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
does
michigan
have
such
a
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
common
are
those
statutes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
would
an
officer,
without
such
permission,
want
to
make
a
no
knock
entry
while
possessing
a
warrant--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--a
search
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
moran,
is
it
undisputed
by
you
that
the
client
would
not
have
disposed
of
the
drugs
if
the
police
had
waited
a
few
seconds?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
agree
there
is
a
knock
and
announce
requirement--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--even
though
there
is
a
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
agree
that
that
was
violated
here,
that
there
wasn't
really
a
knock
and
announce
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
exclusion
of
evidence
in
these
circumstances
a
deterrent,
so
that
the
police
would
be
less
likely
to
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
in
this
very
case
you
had
an
officer
who
said
it
was
his
regular
policy--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--never
to
knock
and
announce--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
just
go
in.
so,
if
the
rule
you
propose
is
adopted,
then
every
police
officer
in
america
can
follow
the
same
policy.
is
there
no
policy
protecting
the
homeowner
a
little
bit--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
sanctity
of
the
home--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--from
this
immediate--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--entry?
