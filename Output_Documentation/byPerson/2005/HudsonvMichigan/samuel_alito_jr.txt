well,
what
do
you
think
is
the
standard
for
determining
what
sort
of
causal
connection
there
has
to
be
in
order
to
have
suppression
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
purpose
of
the
causal
connection
requirement?
what's
the
reason
for
having
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what's
the
reason
for
requiring
a
clear
connection?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
why?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
why?
isn't
the
reason
just
a...
just
a
question
of
crafting
an
appropriate
remedy
for...
an
appropriate
deterrence--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--for
violations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
said
the...
you
thought
the
police
here
had
to
wait
what?
15
seconds?
what
was
the
figure
you
gave?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
they
waited
10
seconds.
and
so
there
would
be
a...
a
constitutional
violation?
why
would
suppression
be
appropriate
in
that
situation?
why
would
it
be
in
any
way
proportional
to
the...
to
the
violation
that
occurred?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
wherever
the
line
is,
suppose
they're
just...
they're
just
slightly
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
line?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
you're...
you're
contradicting
the
premise.
