is
that
because
the
damages
are
slight
or
because
there's
a
defense
that
is
successful?
what
has
been
the
defense
in
these
tort
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
moran,
would
you
clarify
an
answer
you
gave
to
justice
o'connor
at
the
outset
of
the
argument?
you
said
there
is
no
statutory
right
to
get
a
no
knock
warrant.
but
did
you
say,
as
a
matter
of
case
law
and
practice,
that
can
be
done
in
michigan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
courts
that
have
allowed
this
action
to
go
forward,
has
the
rationale
been
that
there
is
no
other
effective
deterrent
to
ignoring
or
violating
the
knock
and
announce
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
experience
in
michigan?
the
michigan
supreme
court
has
had
this
rule
for
some
time,
that
you
don't
exclude
the
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
successful
1983
actions
have
there
been--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
have
not
even
one
case
that
you
can
cite
where
a
1983
remedy
was
resorted
to
and
was
successful.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
aware
of
any
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
anyone
has
recovered--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
the
no
knock
warrant,
do
you
agree
that
it's
not
possible
to
get
one
in
michigan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--position
is
that
you
never...
if
you
have
a
warrant,
then
you
can
seize
what
the
warrant
lists.
so,
if
you
have
a
warrant,
then
there
is
never
a
reason
that
the
police
would
have
to
knock
and
announce,
because
the
warrant
gives
them
independent
authority
to
enter.
that
seems
to
be
what
you're
saying,
that
as
long
as
you
have
a
warrant,
there...
the
knock
and
announce
does
not
have
to
be
complied
with.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
it
have
been
possible
for
these
police
to
get
a
no
knock
warrant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
a...
this
is
a
place...
a
case
in
which
the
warrant
was
for
drugs.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
going
back
to
my
question,
isn't
it
then
a
reasonable
assumption,
based
on
the
police
experience
in
case
after
case,
that
where
there...
where
narcotics
are
housed,
there
is
often
a
gun
and
there
is
ease
of
disposal,
couldn't
the
police
simply
say
this
is
a
narcotics
search
and
therefore
we
don't
need
to
knock
and
announce
because
those
circumstances
will
be
present
in
most
cases?
