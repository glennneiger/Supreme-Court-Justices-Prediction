mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
knock
and
announce
rule,
unlike
the
warrant
and
probable
cause
requirements,
does
not
protect
the
individual's
privacy
interest
in
the
items
to
be
searched,
and
does
not
relate
to
the
officer's
authority
to
conduct
the
search
and
obtain
the
evidence.
an
unannounced
or
premature
entry,
therefore,
does
not
detract
from
the
officer's
legal
authority
reflected
in
the
warrant
to
enter
and
conduct
a
search.
instead,
as
this
court
held
in
segura,
an
untainted
warrant
provides
an
independent
source
for
the
search,
even
where
the
entry
is
illegal.
there
was
only
one
entry
in
the
segura
case,
since
the
officers
remained
in
the
apartment
until
a
warrant
was
finally
obtained.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
there
are...
there
are
several
reasons
why
the
court
has...
the
court
has
articulated
several
reasons
for
why
there
is
the
knock
and
announce
rule.
we
think
the
important
point,
though,
with
regard
to
the
segura
case
is
that
the
entry,
in
segura,
was
unlawful
both
because
the
officers
did
not
announce
and
because
they
did
not
have
a
warrant.
they,
nonetheless,
stayed
there
for
20
hours,
and,
when
they
finally
did
obtain
a
warrant,
they
conducted
the
search.
and
this
court
had
no
difficulty
in
saying
that,
even
though
the
initial
entry
was
unlawful,
the
warrant
authorized
search...
the
warrant
was
an
independent
source
for
the
search,
and
that
the
legality
with
regard
to
the
initial
entry
was,
quote,
"wholly
irrelevant
to
the
evidence
that
was
obtained
pursuant
to
the
warrant.
"
and
we
would
submit
that
it
would
be
an
odd
fourth
amendment
rule
that
would
allow
admission
of
the
evidence
where
the
officers
failed
to
obtain
a
warrant.
they
entered
without
a
warrant
and
without
announcement,
and
only
later
obtained
one,
as
in
segura;
and
then
suppress
all
evidence,
in
this
case,
where
the
officers
did
obtain
a
warrant
in
advance,
and
their
only
illegality
was
the
much
more
minor
one
of
entering
a
few
moments
prematurely.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
nothing
in
this
court's
cases--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
that's
fine,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
the
warrant,
in
segura,
was
obtained
by...
based
on
evidence
that
was
in
existence
prior
to
the
unlawful
entry,
so
that
it
was
an
untainted
warrant.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
of
course,
the
officers...
once
that
warrant
was
obtained,
officers
would
have
to
enter
the
apartment
in
order
to
conduct
a
search--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--here,
except
for
the
fact
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--they
had
already
entered
illegally
and
were
already
present
illegally--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--in
the
apartment.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--in
segura.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
absolutely
correct,
and
that's--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--a
requirement
for--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
with
respect,
i
think
that's...
it
would
be
an
improper
reading
of
segura.
there
was
an
illegal
entry,
in
segura,
that
was
just
as
necessary
in
order
to
conduct
the
search
and
obtain
evidence
in
that
case
as
there
was
at
premature
entry
here.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
their...
they
had
no
knowledge
of
the
illegality,
and
the
evidence
that
was...
that
was
the
basis
for
the
affidavit
for
the
warrant
was
untainted
by
the
illegal
entry.
but,
of
course,
the
same
is
true
here,
there
was...
there
is
no
allegation
at
all
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the
warrant
in
this
case--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--is
tainted.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
with
respect,
that
is...
that
is
directly
at
odds
with
the
way
the
court,
in
segura,
approached--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the
question.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
think
segura
is
contrary
to
that.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
think
murray--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--is
contrary
to
that.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
in
fact,
that
is
precisely
the
analysis--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
precisely
the
analysis
the
court
ordered...
took
in
segura.
it
said,
if
there
had
been
no
illegal
entry,
the
officers--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--would
have
obtained
the
evidence--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the
same
way--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--because
they
had--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
your...
i'm
just
informing
your
honor
what
the
segura
case
says.
it
says
the
court...
the
courts
would
have
found...
excuse
me...
the
officers
would
have
found
the
same
evidence
that
they
found
pursuant
to
the
warrant
if
they
had
complied
with
the
fourth
amendment.
that's
because
the
court
viewed
the...
that
warrant
as
a
separate
independent
source
for
the
authority
to
enter
and
conduct
a
search.
one
would
have
to
posit,
i
guess,
that
the
officers
in
this
case,
if
they...
if
they
would
rather
not
execute
the
warrant
than
delay
a
few
additional
moments
before
entering,
but
i
think
that
would
not
be
a
very
realistic
hypothesis.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
now,
with
regard--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
your
honor.
the
knock
and
announce
requirement
is...
we
take
no
issue
with
that.
that
is
required
by
the
fourth
amendment.
with
regard--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--to
deterrence--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
not--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--of
course
the--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--of
course
there
is--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
and
that
is
not--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--our
position.
and
we,
respectfully,
would
argue
that
that's
not
an
appropriate
way
to
conduct
the
deterrence
analysis.
even
just
on
the
terms
of
deterrence,
we
think
that
suppression
here
would
be
a
disproportionate
remedy.
and
that's
because,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
the
officers
already
have
an
incentive,
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
circumstances,
to
announce
and
delay
some
period
of
time
before
entry.
now,
there
may
be--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--not--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--it's
not
to
be
mistaken
for
an
intruder
and
shot
at,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
not
really...
i
mean,
to
be
fair,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
he
testified
to,
exactly.
what
he
said
was,
he's
been
shot
at
several
times,
and
he
went
in
early,
in
this
case,
in
part
because
of
his
safety
concerns.
but
he
didn't
speak
to
any
broader
policy.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
but,
in
any
event,
the--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
there
are
several
reasons.
one...
and,
again,
this
court...
these
are...
all
of
the
things
i'm
going
to
list
come
from
this
court's
cases,
including
nix
and
murray
and
segura,
where
the
court
has
applied
the
doctrines
we
ask
the
court
to
apply
here.
and
what
you
have
is,
you
have
the
inherent
incentive
to
knock
and
announce,
because
of
their
own
safety
concerns.
we
think
the
only
thing
that
might
not
cover,
in
terms
of
deterrence,
would
be
the
additional
few
moments
you
may
want
them
to
wait.
they
will
announce,
and
they
will
delay
some
period
of
time.
now,
in
the
absence
of
concerns
about
safety
or
destruction
of
evidence,
the
officers
have
nothing
to
gain
by
entering
prematurely.
and
so,
in
doing
a
deterrence
analysis,
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
that
in
mind.
it's
not
like
there's
a
huge
gain
for
the
officers--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--when
they
don't
have
legitimate
concerns.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--to
be
sure,
your
honor,
there
are
times
when
they
may
miscalculate
the
nature
of
the
concerns
about
safety
and
destruction
of
evidence,
but,
in
cases
where
there
aren't
those
concerns,
they
have
nothing
to
gain.
and,
in
addition,
entering
prematurely
may
make
them
a
defendant
in
1983
or
bivens
actions,
which
i'm
sure
that
no
officer--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--relishes
and--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--may
i
answer,
your
honor?
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
i
would...
i
would
disagree
with
that.
and
i
would
point
the
court,
in
particular,
to
a
recent
case
out
of
the
seventh
circuit,
jones
versus
wilhelm.
the
seventh
circuit
has
announced
the
position...
it
decided
the
position
that
we
advocate.
there
are
many
cases,
your
honor...
the
courts...
the
courts
are
replete
with
them...
where
people--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--bring
those
types
of
claims,
and
win,
and
then
they
settle.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
suppression
would
not
be
an
appropriate
remedy
in
this
context
for
two
primary
reasons.
the
first
is
if
the
knock
and
announce
rule
does
not
protect
the
individual's
privacy
interest
in
the
underlying
items
seized
and,
instead,
it
seeks
to
limit
discrete
risks
related
to
the
execution
of
warrants
that
property
will
be
damaged,
that
officers
will
be
mistaken
for
intruders,
or
that
occupants
will
be
caught
in
embarrassing
situations.
that
makes
the
knock
and
announce
rule
similar
to
other
fourth
amendment
requirements
related
to
the
manner
of
executing
warrants
such
as--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--it
would
not
be
a
departure,
your
honor.
in
fact,
that's
common
practice
in
the
fourth
amendment
area.
this
court,
for
example,
in
new
york
v.
harris
looked
to
the
purposes
of
the
rule
against
arrest
in
the
home
absent
a
warrant
and
to
conclude
that
it
wasn't
appropriate
to
suppress
a
statement
made
at
the
station
even
though
it
assumed
that
there
was
but
for
causation.
and
this
court
in
cruz
did
a
similar
analysis.
it's
very
common
to
look
to
the
purposes
served--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--but--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
your
honor.
i
mean,
certainly
that's...
that
is
one
of
the
principles
underlying
the
fourth
amendment,
but
this
court
has
looked
to
the
types
of
considerations
i'm
discussing,
and
i
will
give
you
some
examples.
and
we
think,
in
fact,
the
knock
and
announce
rule
is
very
analogous
to...
for
example,
to
a
claim
of
unnecessary
property
damage
or
to
a
claim
that
the
officers
brought
the
media
along
when
they
shouldn't
or
that
they
used
excessive
force.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct.
the
illegality--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
warrantless
search
or
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
violation.
that
might
be--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--of
the
manner
of
execution.
but
again,
if
i
may--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
think
the
question
in
that
case,
your
honor,
would
be
about
reasonable
reliance
on
the
warrant
and
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
mistake.
and
if
it
wasn't,
then
it
would
be
a
warrantless
search.
and
if
i
may
just
focus
the
court...
attention
on
the
claim
of
unnecessary
property
damage.
we
think
that's
quite
analogous
here
in
part
because
the
typical...
in
the
typical
case,
a
premature
or
unannounced
entry
will
be
a
forcible
entry.
but
whether
the
claim
is
that
the
officers
entered
a
few
moments
prematurely
or
that
they
unnecessarily
used
a
battering
ram
on
the
door,
in
either
case
the...
the
violation
doesn't
relate
to
the
privacy
interests
and
the
items
to
be
seized
and
shouldn't
result
in
suppression.
and
in
addition
to
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
that
certainly
is--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that...
that
certainly
is
true,
your
honor,
but
that...
that
is
not
a
protection--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
your
honor.
the
point
of
knock
and
announce
is
a
more
limited
privacy.
it's
not
related
to
the
privacy
of
the
items
to
be
seized.
that's
separate.
and
that's
why
it
makes
it
like
the
claim
of
unnecessary--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
what...
what
focuses
in
terms
of
suppression
is
whether
the
government
has
obtained
an
evidentiary
advantage
as
a
consequence
of
the
illegality.
here,
the
illegality
was
the
failure
to
delay
a
few
additional
moments
before
entry.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
but--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
if
i
may
try
to
explain.
i
think
as
a
general
matter,
with
regard
to
physical
evidence
in
the
home
that's
within
the
scope
of
the
search
warrant,
that
you're...
you're
probably
right.
most
of
the
time,
that
evidence
will
come
in.
we
think
that
there
are
probably
at
least
two
areas
that
might
lead
to
suppression
in
these
cases.
one
is
the...
the
type
of
statements
that
the
chief
justice
mentioned
earlier.
another
might
be
what
you
might
call
proximity
evidence,
that
the
officers
went
in
prematurely
and
as
a
result,
they
saw
a--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
i
don't
think...
i
think
there
is
a
reasonable
argument
that
could
be--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i'm...
i'm
attempting
to
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
a
reasonable
argument
that
could
be
made
in
this
case
that
there
wasn't
a
violation.
i
think
it
was
probably
a
sort
of
strategy.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
can't...
i
can't
second
guess
their
strategy
here
to
concede
it.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
think
i
probably
would
have
argued
in
the
alternative,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
probably
the
safest--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
think
generally
no,
your
honor.
i
think...
and
i
would...
i
would--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i...
not
in
this
court.
there...
there
may
be
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
the
way
that
the
court
would
analyze
that
would
be,
again,
along
the
same
lines.
now,
certainly
in
jurisdictions
that
haven't
adopted
the
rule
that
we're
articulating
here,
the
courts
may
suppress.
but
we
think
under
the
principles
we're
articulating,
that
suppression
probably
would
not
be
appropriate
there.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
you
know,
we
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
we
think
that
there
are
two
separate
questions,
what
the
constitution
requires
and
whether
suppression
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
the
court
has
always
treated
those--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
if
i
may.
it's
also
hornbook
law
now
in
this
court
that
you
can't
unnecessarily
destroy
property
in
executing
the
warrant
or
effecting
the
entry
and
that
you
can't
bring
the
media
along.
this
court
in
both
ramirez
and--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
i...
i
think
that's
probably
the
position
that
we
would
take.
i
think
the
way
the
court
would
analyze
that,
as
it
has
done
in
these
other
cases,
it
would
look
to
two
factors.
one,
what
are
the
purposes
served
by
the
fourth
amendment
rule
that's
violated
and
how
well
those
purposes
fit
with
the
remedy
of
suppression;
and
two,
whether
