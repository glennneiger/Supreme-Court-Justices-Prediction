mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
metaphor
of
"fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree"
is
frequently
employed
when
the
exclusionary
rule
is
discussed.
and
that
metaphor
is
apt.
it
is
apt,
because
the
sanction
of
exclusion,
which
is
not,
itself,
constitutionally
required,
is
designed
to
deter,
and
to
deter
in
a
specific
way
to
deter
by
depriving
the
police
of
the
result...
the
fruit,
the
product,
the
evidentiary
advantage
that
has
been
gained
by
their
improper
conduct.
and
so--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes,
there
was
a...
an
announcement,
but
a
failure
to
wait.
there's
not...
the
announcement
principles
require--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--not
only
an--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--it
may
be.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
but
i
believe
that,
before
the
question
of
deterrence
is
reached,
the
question
of
causality
must
be
addressed.
this
court
has
always
said
that
causation
is
a
necessary,
though
not
always
sufficient,
predicate,
for
a
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
way
this
court
has
put
it
is
that
it
is
clear
that
implementation
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
particular
cases
begins
with
the
premise
that
the
challenged
evidence
is,
in
some
sense,
the
product
of
the
improper
police
activity.
so,
i
believe--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--the
question--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--i
think...
i
think
where
i
would
disagree,
your
honor,
is
that
the
entry
is
lawful...
in
fact,
it's
not
simply
authorized,
it's
commanded
by
judicial
order.
the
use
of
force--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--the
way
i
distinguish
it,
and
what
i...
where
i
believe
the
distinction
lies
is
that
what
was
improper
was
not
the
fact
of
entry;
what
was
improper
was
the
use
of
force
in
entry.
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--knock
and
announce--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
again,
the
use
of
force
in
making
the
entry
violated
the
knock
and
announce
rule.
the
entry
itself
was
commanded
by
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
because
if
they're--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--no,
if--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--if
there
is
no
warrant,
there
is
no
judicial
command
to
enter,
so
the
entry
is
completely
unjustified.
here,
we
have
not
set
the
appropriate--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--because
the
fourth
amendment
commands
that
the
police
not
enter
without
judicial
authorization.
the
police
don't
get
to
make
the
probable
cause
decision
in
advance.
and
we
wish
to
have
a
judge
make
that
decision,
so
we
won't,
in
hindsight,
say,
"had
you
gone
to
the
judge,
the
judge
would
have
found
probable
cause,
so
we'll
ratify
what
you
did
after
the
fact.
"
the
entry
itself...
not
just
the
manner
of
entry...
the
entry
is
invalid,
unless
the
judge
authorizes
it,
or
unless
some
exception
exists.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
the
fact
of
entry
was
lawful.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
the
entry
was
lawful.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
the
entry
would
be
lawful.
the
manner
of
entry
would
be
unlawful.
and
the
consequence
of
that
entry
would
turn
on
what
force
was
used.
as,
in
this
case,
they
opened
the
door
and
walked
in.
there
was
no...
there
was
no
injury
to
person,
there
was
no
injury
to
property.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
my
principle
that
i
am
advocating
is
that
any
police
error
in
the
execution
of
a
search,
or
in
the
accomplishment
of
a
search,
bears
fruit
only
in
relation
to
the
purpose,
or
purposes,
served
by
the
principle
violated.
one--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--has
to
ask--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that
is
if
one
assumes
that
the
civil
remedy...
that
the
1983
actions
has
no
teeth
and
has
no
force,
and
i
don't
believe
that's
true
at
all.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
uh
huh.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
am
not...
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
on
the
other
hand,
like
mr.
moran,
i...
other
than
anecdotal
evidence,
i
have
no
statistical
evidence
that
the
police
are
violating
the
knock
and
announce
principle
since
the
decision
in
stevens.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
in
michigan,
i
don't.
there
are
cases
cited
in
our
brief
where,
in
fact,
there
are
actions...
such
actions
brought.
there
are
several
recent
decisions
in
the
seventh
circuit,
for
example,
where
qualified
immunity
was
denied
on
a
knock
and
announce
violation
in
the
cases
in
the
district
court
for
trial
or
settlement.
and
there
may
be
many
cases
that
don't
make
the
reports,
what
actions
are
brought
and
settled.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
am
not
aware
of
any
case--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--and,
again,
i
think
mr.
moran
correctly
points
out,
in...
many
of
these
cases
are
resolved
by
finding
that
the
richards
v.
wisconsin
exceptions
have
been
met.
it
is
not,
to
me,
remarkable
that
there
are
not
a
lot
of
civil
actions.
i
believe
there
are
not
a
lot
of
violations,
because,
while
no
knock
entries
may
occur,
they
are
justified,
under
richards
v.
wisconsin,
in
most
cases.
this
case
is
an
aberration.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes,
there
is
no
statute
in
michigan
where
one
can
go
to
the
judge
in
advance
and
say,
"here
are
the
facts,
known
to
me
already,
before
i
even
get
to
the
scene,
that
should
justify
a
no
knock.
"
that
doesn't
exist
in
michigan.
michigan
follows
richards
v.
wisconsin,
and,
in...
had
case
law,
even
in
advance
of
that,
which
simply
said,
"whether
known
in
advance,
or
whether
the
facts
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
warrant,
if
the
richards
exceptions
are
met,
you
can
go
in
without
knocking
and
announcing.
"
so,
we
do
follow
that
rule.
you
just
simply
can't
get
advance
judicial
authorization.
it
doesn't
exist.
but
it
is
certainly
permissible,
and
it...
as
mr.
moran
indicated,
it
happens
on
a
fairly
regular
basis,
because,
unlike
mr.
moran,
i
believe
the
notion
that...
even
in
this
case,
i'm
not
saying
there
was
no
violation;
there
was
a
violation,
because
the
police
didn't
know
in
advance
that
the
defendant
was
sitting
in
a
chair
with
the
cocaine
in
his
pocket,
on
the
chair
in
front
of
him,
and
a
gun
by
his
side.
i
think
that
he
would
have
answered
the
door.
it's
highly
speculative,
and
somewhat
fanciful,
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
true,
but
the
drugs
were...
in
this
case,
the
drugs
were
in
his
pocket.
so,
it
wouldn't
have
helped
him.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
there
was--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--the
gun
was
in
the...
in
the
chair,
but
he
was
only
convicted
for
the
drugs
in
his
pocket.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
don't
think
he...
he
could
say,
"if
you
would
have...
i
would
have
gotten
up
and
answered
the
door;
and,
therefore,
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
come
in
without
knocking,
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
break
the
door,
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
scare
me.
"
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's...
that
may
well
be.
and
i
want
to
be
clear,
i
am
not
here
arguing
that
this
court
should
decide
that
there
is
no
circumstance
possible
where
something
that
occurs
in
the
premises
is
not
causally
connected
to
the
failure
to
knock
and
announce.
all
i'm
asking
the
court
to
decide
is
that
causation
is
required
before
the
exclusionary
rule
is
implemented,
and
physical
evidence
found
within
a
proper
search
of...
search
of
proper
scope,
pursuant
to
the
warrant,
that
that
is
not
causally
connected
to
the...
to
the
knock
and
announce
violation.
there
may
be
other--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--no.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
i--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--i
think
the
only
thing
he
could--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--but
i
think
you
have
to
tie
the
causal
connection
to
the
purposes...
as
i
have
tried
to
indicated...
to
the
purpose,
or
purposes,
served
by
the
principle
violated.
what
is
the
purpose
of
knocking
and
announcing?
and
i
think...
your
honor
indicated...
it's
to
protect
against
injury
to
the
police,
injury
of
people
inside,
and
property.
it
has
no
purpose
to
protect
against
the
invasion
of
the
privacy
of
the
dwelling
and
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
in
fact,
if
the
police
knew
in
advance
that
the
defendant
might
flush
the
drugs
down
the
toilet,
they
wouldn't
have
to
knock
and
announce
at
all.
so,
i
think
we
have
to
relate
the
causal
question
to,
what
is
the
principle
violated?
what
purposes
does
it
serve?
and,
in
the
case
of
knock
and
announce,
it
does
not
serve
the
purpose
of
allowing
evidence
to
be
destroyed.
that,
in
fact,
serves
as
an
exception
to
knocking
and
announcing
at
all.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
this
court
has
identified
it
on
several
occasions
as
to
avoid
unnecessary
violence
to
the
property,
avoid
unnecessary
possible
injury
to
people,
both
to
the
officers
who
are
executing
the
warrant
and
people
inside,
and
to
allow
the
person
inside
to
prepare
to
answer...
as
mr.
moran
indicated,
if
they
might
be
in
a
state
of
undress
or
something,
they
could
avoid
that
embarrassment.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
will
never
be
the
cause
of
the
discovery
of
the
physical
evidence
found--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
if
a--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
oh,
in
those
cases,
correct.
in
cases
where
there
is
violence,
there
will
be
recovery.
in
a
case
such
as
the
instant
one,
where
there
is
no
nakedness,
there
is
no
violence,
they
simply
opened
an
unlocked
door,
i
would
say,
yes,
there
would
be
no
recovery,
in
that
circumstance;
there
would
be
no
damages.
there
may
be
cases...
and
this
is
why
not...
i'm
not
arguing
there
was
no
knock
and
announce
violation,
in
that
the
police
shouldn't
knock
and
announce,
because,
in
different
cases,
the
consequences
may
be
dramatic,
they
may
be
severe,
and
damages
may
be
severely
assessed.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
think,
as
in
other
situations
where
this
court
does
not
apply
the
exclusionary
rule,
simply
on
a
deterrence
basis...
because
the
court
does
not
always
apply
the
exclusionary
rule,
even
when
there
would
be
deterrence...
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes,
exactly.
that
was
precisely
the
point
i
was
going
to
make,
in
terms
of
a
hypothetical.
we're
not
arguing...
as
i
tried
to
indicate
earlier,
we're
not
arguing
that
you
need
to
resolve
every
question
today
about
what
is,
or
is
not,
causally
related.
and
there
are
circumstances
where
a
spontaneous
declaration...
you
know,
the
police
break
through
the
door,
and
the
defendant
says,
"the
drugs
are
in
the
closet.
"
and
you
want
to
use
that
declaration
to
tie
him
to
the
drugs...
that
may
well
be
causally
connected.
all
we're
asking
today
is
for
this
court
to
decide
that
the
items...
the
physical
evidence
found
within
a
proper
scope,
a
search
of
proper
scope
of
the
warrant
that's
being
executed...
is
not
causally
connected.
other
questions
of
spontaneous
declarations,
tying
the
defendant
by
position
to
the
chair,
those
may
present
different
issues.
but
the
drugs
that
were
named
in
the
search
warrant
as
items
to
be
searched
for
and
seized
are
not
causally
connected;
they
are
the
fruit
of
the
execution
of
the
judicial
command,
not
of
the
knock
and
announce
violation.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i'm
not
away
of
any.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yeah.
and
i
think
the
reason
that
that
exists
is
because,
up
til
today...
and
mr.
moran's
correct,
most
courts
go
the
other
way...
up
until
the
stevens
case,
the
assumption
had
been...
and
i
think
the
assumption
has
come
from
miller
and
sabbath...
the
assumption
has
been,
if
there's
a
knock
and
announce
violation,
you
exclude
the
evidence.
so,
questions
of
causation
have
not
been
explored
until
the
stevens
case,
and
then
the
seventh
circuit,
in
several
opinions,
has
also
reached
the
same
conclusion.
but
i
think
sabbath
and
miller
present
very
different
circumstances.
sabbath
and
miller,
as
the
court
will
recall,
were
arrest
cases.
and
the
arrest
situation
does
not
translate
into
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant,
because
knock
and
announce
serves
a
different
purpose,
an
additional
purpose,
in
the
arrest
situation,
that
is
not
served
when...
in
the
search
situation.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
think
it's
much
more
speculative
in
the...
in
the
fifth
amendment
area,
but
i
think--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--but
i
think
to
not
accept
causation
as
a
requirement,
which
i
think
this
court
has
always
done...
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
this
court
has
said
that
implementation
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
premised
on
the
evidence
being
the
product
of
the
police
misconduct.
to
not
do
that,
to
not
have
a
causation
requirement,
i
believe,
severs
this
court's
current
exclusionary
rule
doctrines
from
its
moorings.
there
are
many
circumstances
that
this
court
has,
at
this
point,
at
least,
seen
fit
to
rest
with
the
lower
courts,
such
as
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant.
you
search
within
proper
scope,
you're
looking
for
computer
monitors,
you
find
them,
but,
as
you're
executing,
you
open
a
desk
drawer
and
you
shut
it,
you
exceed
the
scope
of
the
warrant.
the
law
is
pretty
uniform,
currently,
that
you
don't
suppress
the
computer
monitors
because
you
exceeded
the
scope
by
opening
the
drawer.
if
you
found
drugs
in
the
drawer,
you
make...
you'd
exclude
those.
but
you
don't
exclude
the
monitors,
because
there's
not
a
causal
connection
between
the
wrong
in
exceeding
the
scope
of
the
warrant
and
the
discovery
of
the
monitors.
all
those
cases
are
up
for
grabs
again
if
this
court
severs
the
causation
requirement
from
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
and
that's
just
one
example;
there
are
others.
this
court
has
always
required
that
there
be
a
causal
connection,
and
i
believe
that
it
should
simply
continue
to
do
so.
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
overrule
any
cases,
to
create
any
really
new
principles,
we're
simply
asking
this
court
to
understand
that
sabbath
and
miller
were
knock
and
announce
for
arrests.
with
an
arrest
situation,
if
a
person
surrenders
at
the
door,
you
don't
go
in
and
search
the
premises
thoroughly.
there's
a
different
purpose
served
in
arrest.
with
a
search
warrant,
knock
and
announce
has
no
purpose
of
protecting
the
privacy
of
the
dwelling
itself
with
the
discovery
of
the
items
named
in
the
warrant,
and
they
shouldn't
be
suppressed.
things
that
are
causally
connected
can
be
left
to
an
argument
that
may
be
made
by
counsel
in
different
situations,
but,
as
to
the
items
named
in
the
warrant...
contraband,
fruit,
spirits,
instrumentalities...
that
should
not
be
suppressed.
it
is
simply
not
causally
connected
to
the
entry,
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
so
hold.
thank
you.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
justice
robert
jackson
once
said
that
when
he
was
arguing
cases
before
the
court,
he
always
gave
three
arguments
the
well
structured
argument
he
rehearsed,
the
disjointed
and
confused
argument
he
delivered
to
the
court,
and
the
brilliant
argument
he
thought
of
in
the
car
on
the
way
home.
i
have
the
rare
opportunity
to
deliver
the
argument
i
thought
of
in
the
car
on
the
way
home.
[laughter]
but
i'm
going
to
refrain,
mindful
of
the
fact
that
this
is
our...
our
second
time
through
and
try
to
hone
in
on...
on
what
i
think
are
some
critical
points.
a
search
warrant,
a
judicial
command,
must
be
obtained
from
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
it
must
particularly
describe
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
things
to
be
seized,
and
it
must
be
issued
based
on
probable
cause
drawn
from
information
which
is
sworn
to
are
affirmed...
or
affirmed.
if
these
requirements
are
met,
the
privacy
of
the
described
premises
will
be
invaded,
and
any
privilege
the
occupants
might
have
to
withhold
evidence
or
contraband
from
the
police
is
abrogated.
but
that
command
must
be
executed
in
a
reasonable
fashion.
and
so
the
police
may
not
bring
third
parties
into
the
premises
who
are
unnecessary
to
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
they
may
not
search
in
places
where
the
items
described
may
not
be
found.
they
may
not
cause
unnecessary
damage
to
property,
and
they
may
not
use
force
to
accomplish
the
entry
unless
consent
to
enter
is
denied
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
or
unless
entering
immediately
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
to
avoid
the
destruction
of
the
evidence
or
harm
to
the
officers.
if
no
valid
warrant
exists
in
the
first
place,
then...
and
no
exception
exists,
then
the
privacy
of
the
dwelling
has
been
unlawfully
invaded.
it
never
should
have
happened.
but
if
a
valid
warrant
exists
and
some
error
occurs
in
its
execution,
it
is
not
the
invasion
of
privacy
which
should
not
have
occurred
that
is
commanded
by
the
warrant.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
let
me
first
say
this
case
was
not
structured
to
try...
to
try
to...
to
get
it
here
on
our...
on
our
part.
i
think
initially
the
prosecutor
handling
the
hearing
here
reached
the
conclusion
that
richards
precluded
an
argument
that
a
no...
that
the
failure
to
knock
and
announce
was
justified
here.
but--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
again,
i...
i
think
it
would
be
an
interesting
argument
to
revisit
richards
on
this
proposition.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
again,
i
think
the...
the
belief
of
the
prosecutors,
as
the
case
went
forward,
was
that
because
that
belief,
the...
you're
correct.
guns
were
described
as
things
to
be
seized
in
the
warrant.
the
probable
cause
for
that
was
not
any
specific
knowledge
about
a
gun
in
the
house.
it
was
the
officer's
general
experience
that
when
i
execute
search
warrants
for
drugs,
guns
tend
to
be
there.
richards
seems
to
say,
at
least
it
certainly
could
be
argued,
that's
not
sufficient.
you
can't
make
that
decision
based
on
experience
that
drugs
and
guns
go
together.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes,
it
did.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no.
i...
i
don't
because
i
believe
probable
cause
can
be
based
on
the
experience
of
officers--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--without
specific
knowledge
of
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--it
may
not
have
been
a
good
reason,
but
it
was
the
reason
in
that
the
prosecutors
believed
that
the
rejection
of
the
drugs
and
guns
always
go
together
as
justifying
a
crime.
not
knocking
and
announcing
in
richards
meant
that
the
determination
in
this
case
that
guns
were
on
the
premises
based
on
the
officer's
experience
that
drugs
and
guns
go
together,
not
any
specific
knowledge
about
a
gun
was
inadequate
then
to
forgive
knocking
and
announcing.
that
may
have
been
a
misjudgment,
but
it
was
a
belief
that
richards
foreclosed
that.
it
was
not
an
attempt
to
set
the
case
up.
we
had
the
stevens
case
in
michigan.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no.
i...
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
i
think
if
there's
specific
knowledge
that
there
are
guns
on
the
premises,
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
they
knew...
i
think
then
they
would
enter
without
knocking.
if...
if
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
no,
it's
knowledge
based
on
experience.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
understand
but
the
facts
in
the
affidavit
justifying
looking
for
guns
was
in
my
experience
drugs
and
guns
go
together.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
would
be
happy
to...
to,
in
a
different
case,
make
the
argument
that
although
richards
says
a
court
cannot
say
that
knock
and
announce
is
forgiven
every
time
a
drug
warrant
is
executed
on
the
theory
that
experience
teaches
that
drugs
and
guns
go
together.
i'd
be
happy
to
argue
that
that
holding
does
not
apply
when
a
judge
determines,
in
issuing
the
warrant,
that
drugs
and
guns
go
together,
so
i'm
putting
it
in
the
warrant.
i'd
be
happy
to
argue
that
case.
at
this
time--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--prosecutors
believed
that
richards
couldn't
be
avoided
by
putting
the
drugs
and
guns
go
together
into
the
warrant
instead
of--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--the
judge--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--yes,
there
have
been
a
handful
of
cases
where
defense
attorneys
have
filed
a
motion,
despite
people
v.
stevens,
and
then
they...
they
have
lost
because
of
stevens.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no.
now,
in
the
criminal
case,
the
prosecutor
is
responsible...
be,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
although
the
judge
refused
to
follow
stevens--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--there
should
be
no
hearing.
they're
not
conceding
the
violation.
they're
simply
saying
the...
a
violation
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
the
admission
of
the
evidence,
so
we
should
not
litigate
it.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
exactly.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--in
the
criminal--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--or...
or
civil
litigation.
there
is
no...
there
is
no
exclusion.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i...
i
am
not
aware
of
one
from
michigan.
i
am
aware
that
there
have
been
civil
judgments
against
officers
from
other
jurisdictions.
i'm
not
aware
of
one
in
michigan.
i
know
there
have...
there
are
some
suits
that
have
been
brought
in
the
eastern
district
that
are
pending.
and...
and
part
of
the
difficulty
is
civil
suits
can
be
brought.
they
can
be
settled.
there
can
even
be
trials
and
damages
awarded,
and
they
won't
be
in
the
reports.
they're
not
in
the
f.
supp.
's.
they're
not
in
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--i
think
one
could
also
make
the
argument
that
that
cuts
the
other
way.
the
fact
that
there
are
not
a
lot
of
reported
decisions
may
mean
there's
not
a
lot
of
violations
going
on,
that
the
police
are
not
routinely
kicking
down
doors
without
knocking
and
announcing
when
they
should,
and
that's
why
they're
not
being
sued.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no.
it's
not--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--it
might
be,
but
it's
not
been
my
experience
that
either...
either
the
criminals
or
certainly
innocent
parties,
people...
probable
cause,
after
all,
doesn't
mean
certainty.
people
who
have
had
damage
done
or
physical
injury
occur
have
been...
are
shy
about
suing
the
government
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that
certainly
hasn't
been
my
experience
and
certainly
not
in
my
county.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
would...
i
would
think
so.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
would
be
my
position.
i
would
have
thought,
as
the
prosecutor
thought
here,
that
a
probable
cause
finding
that
guns
are
in
the
house,
based
not
on
any
specific
knowledge
about
guns,
but
based
on
experience
in
similar
circumstances,
was
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
richards
in
terms
of
not
knocking.
i
would
certainly
make
the
argument
that
it
ought
to
be,
but
i
would
have
not
criticized
the
prosecutor--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--and...
and
i
think
your
honor
is
correct.
the
prosecutor's
point
in
this
case
was
we
shouldn't
litigate--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
certainly.
let
me
give
an
example.
one
of
the
circumstances
that
i
indicated
that
the
police...
a
manner
in
which
the
police
must
behave
when
reasonably
executing
a
warrant
is
not
to
look
in
places
where
the
items
sought
cannot
be
found.
if
the
police
were
searching
a
house
for
stolen
computer
monitors,
a
large
object,
and
as
they
were
searching
for
them,
they
opened
the
desk
drawer
where
the
monitor
could
not
be
and
they
shut
it,
and
they
found
computer
monitors
in
the
home,
the...
this
court
has
never
addressed
the
question,
that
i'm
aware
of,
but
the
law
is
uniform
in
the
country
that
you
would
not
suppress
the
computer
monitors.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
would
be
my
position
that
in
all
of
those
cases,
there
was
a
causal
connection
between
the
evidence
found
in
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--let
me
try
to
give
a
couple
of
examples
from
different
situations
to
make
my
point
that
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--your
honor
is
correct,
and
i
am
confident
that
when
the
officers
returned
with
the
search
warrant,
with
the
officers
already
inside,
they
did
not
knock
and
announce
when
they
when
they
returned
to
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--because
of
the
habeas
concerns
of
comity
that
this
court
has,
that's
correct.
it
is
also
not
suppressed.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
let...
let
me
try
a
couple
of
examples
that--
[laughter]
--that
i...
that
i
hope
might
make
the
point.
it
is...
and
my...
my
belief
is...
it's
common
in
human
experience
that
things
can
be
accomplished
either
by
command
or
by
permission
when
the
manner
of
doing
so,
the
manner
in
which
they
end
up
being
accomplished
is
subject
to
criticism.
and
let
me
give
a
couple
quick
examples.
if,
when
she
was
young,
i
sent
my
daughter
to
her
room...
and
that
was
rare,
but
if
i
sent
her
to
her
room
and
she
stomped
up
the
stairs
and
slammed
the
door,
she
would
be
in
further
difficulty
not
because
she
carried
out
my
command
by
going
to
her
room,
but
because
she
stomped
up
the
stairs.
if
a
young
athlete
is
told
by
his
coach,
catch
the
ball
with
two
hands
and
he
catches
it
with
one,
he
is
admonished
not
because
he
caught
the
ball
but
because
he
caught
it
with
one
hand.
and
if
a
football
player
taunts
the
opposing
team
as
he
crosses
the
goal
line,
he
gets
a
penalty
not
because
he
crossed
the
goal
line,
but
because
he
taunted
the
other
team.
these
strictures
are
not
prerequisites
to
the
conduct.
i
do
not
tell
my
daughter
go
to
your
room
but
only
if
you
don't
stomp
up
the
stairs--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--i
think
as...
as...
in
the
examples
i
gave,
knock
and
announce
works
the
same
way.
these
are
not
prerequisites.
they're
rules
of
conduct.
they
are
principles
of
behavior.
it's
not
do
this
only
if
you
behave
in
this
manner.
it's
do
this
and
behave
in
this
manner
while
doing
it.
and
if
you
don't
behave
in
the
manner
we
have
prescribed,
the
question
is
what
flows
from
that
misbehavior,
not
from
the
achievement
of
the
end.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct,
and...
and
the
police
are
not
illegally
on
the
premises
and
my
daughter--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
and
part
of
what...
part
of
what
i
wanted
to
say
also
to
justice
breyer
and
i
think
also
works
here
is
it's...
the
suggestion
seems
to
be
that
knock...
that
a
fourth
amendment
violation...
the
question
of
whether
one
has
occurred
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the...
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
are
one
in
the
same.
and
this
court
has
never
said
that.
to
me
that
would
be
a
dramatic
changing
of
the
law
of
this
court.
this
court
has
always
said
those
are
separate
questions,
and
i
think
petitioner's
argument
conflates
the
two.
we
first
ask
whether
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation
and
then
we
say...
this
court
has
said
the
premise
for
application
of
the
exclusionary
sanction
is
whether
or
not
the
challenged
evidence
is
the
product
of
the
illegal
government
activity.
so
once
we
establish
that
there
has
been
a
constitutional
error,
the
question
becomes
is
the
challenged
evidence
the
product
of
it.
and
just
like
the
touchdown
is
not
the
product
of
the
taunting,
the
entry
into
the
premises
is
not
the
product
of
the
failure
to
knock
and
announce.
it's
the
product
of
a
warrant,
which
the
judge
issued
commanding
the
police
to
enter.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
there's
nothing
fallacious
about
the
argument
if
one
accepts
that
excluding
the
truth
in...
in
a
criminal
proceeding
is
a
fair
tradeoff
in
that
circumstance--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--but...
but
the
court
has--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--yes,
we
do.
but
the
court
has
said
that
because
that's
a
dramatic
thing
to
do,
because
it...
it
has
a
high
societal
cost,
it
should
only
be
done
when
there
is
a
causal
connection,
when
the
evidence
is
the
product
of
the
police
wrongdoing.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
thank
the
court.
