mr.
david
a.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
over
the
last
50
years,
courts
in
virtually
every
american
jurisdiction
have
suppressed
evidence
seized
inside
homes
following
knock
and
announce
violations...
including
this
court,
on
two
occasions.
those
suppression
orders
reflect
an
understanding
of
two
points
key
to
this
appeal.
the
first
point
is
that
the
manner
of
entry...
and,
in
particular,
a
knock
and
announce
violation...
is
not
somehow
independent
of
the
police
activity
that
occurs
inside
the
house.
and,
as
this
court
directly
recognized
in
wilson,
the
reasonableness
of
police
activity
inside
a
home
is
dependent
on
the
manner
of
the
police
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes,
there
are,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
do
not
believe
so,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
believe
about
half
the
states
have
such
no
knock...
no
knock
statutes.
so,
in
michigan,
a
police
officer...
if
the...
if
the
circumstances
on
the
scene
justify
a
no
knock
entry,
then
the
officer
is
permitted,
by
case
law
and,
of
course,
by
the
precedents
of
this
court,
to
go
ahead
and
do
so.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--as
this
case
illustrates,
sometimes
officers
believe
that
it
is
to
their
advantage
to
perform
a
no
knock
entry,
or
to
fail
to
comply
with
the
knock
and
announce
requirement.
and
that
is
why--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
officer
good
apparently
thought
that
his
safety
would
be
better
served
he
if
disregarded
the
knock
and
announce
requirement;
and
so,
he
candidly
testified,
at
the
evidentiary
hearing,
that
it's
essentially
his
policy,
in
drug
cases,
to
go
in
without
a...
without
performing
the
necessary
knock
and
announce.
and
that
was
1
year
after
the...
this
court's
decision
in
richards,
saying
that
there
is
no
per
se
exclusion
of
drug
cases
from
the
knock
and
announce
requirement.
but
that
brings
me
to
the
second
reason
why
courts
have
almost
universally,
until
the
stevens
case
in
1999,
held
that
suppression
of
evidence
is
necessary,
and
that
is
deterrence;
because,
without
the
suppression
of
evidence,
there
is
very
little
chance
that
the
officers
will
be
deterred
from
routinely
violating
the
knock
and
announce
requirement,
from
adopting
a
sort
of
personal
violation
of
the
requirement,
just
as--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes,
that's
the
one
purpose
of
the
knock
and
announce
requirement
that
doesn't
protect
the
homeowner's
interest,
that
protects
the
officer's
interest--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--against
being
shot.
mr.
david
a.
moran
however,
what
we'll
see
then,
if
there
is
no
exclusion
of
evidence
following
knock
and
announce
rules,
are
entries
precisely
like
the
one
we
have
here,
where
the
officers
will,
in
fact,
announce...
they
yell,
"police,
search
warrant"...
but
then
they'll
immediately
go
in.
officer
good
said
that
he
went
in
real
fast.
he
went
in,
and
it
took
him
just
a
few
seconds
to
get
in
the
door.
so,
that's
what
they'll
do.
they'll
announce...
some
officers
will
announce,
because
they'll
want
the--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--people
inside
to
know
that
they're
police,
but
they
will
not
wait
for
a
refusal,
and
they
certainly
will
not
wait
for
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
for
some--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--simply,
justice
scalia,
that,
as
far
as
we
can
determine,
no
one
wins
a
knock
and
announce
case,
or
we
haven't
been
able
to
find
a
single
case
in
which
someone
has
actually
recovered
damages
for
a
knock
and
announce
violation.
so,
if
this--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--both,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
in
many
cases,
such
as
this
one,
where
the
police
don't
actually
destroy
the
door,
it
would
be
very
hard
to
quantify
the
damages,
and
it
would
be
very
hard
to
find
a
lawyer
to
take
a
case
such
as
this.
but
the
second
barrier
is
the
various
immunities,
tort
immunities.
in
section
1983
actions,
there
are
qualified
immunities
that
make
it
difficult
to
win
a
suit.
and
because
it
is
not
a
bright
line
as
to
when
the
police
officers
have
to
knock
and
announce,
and
when
they
do
not...
that
is,
is
there
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
quick
entry
or
a
no
knock
entry
will
be
met
with
violence
or
that
the
evidence
will
be
destroyed
+/?
courts
tend
to
be
very
generous
in
granting
qualified
immunity
to
officers...
that
is,
concluding
that
some
reasonable
officers
might
have
concluded
that
it
was
justified
to
dispense
with
the
knock
and
announcement
requirement.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
there...
but
there
is
not
a
qualified
immunity
defense
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
david
a.
moran
and
so,
if
the
court
concluded--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
true,
to
some
extent,
justice
scalia,
but,
as
an
empirical
matter,
i've
cited
many
cases,
in
my
brief,
over
the
last
50
years
where
courts
from
a
vast
majority
of
american
jurisdictions
have
found
knock
and
announce
violations
in
criminal
cases,
and
have,
therefore,
excluded
the
evidence,
including
this
court,
on
two
occasions,
1958
and
1968.
so,
courts
do
find
knock
and
announce
violations
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
issue
of
a
knock
and
announce--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--violation
leading
to
exclusion
of
evidence--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--was
decided.
the...
there
was
not
an
inevitable
discovery
issue
raised
in
those
two
cases,
because
those
cases
predated
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine.
but,
of
course,
in
1958
and
1968,
this
court
was
very
familiar
with
the
independent
source
doctrine.
and,
really,
the
argument
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
has
adopted...
they
call
it
an
inevitable
discovery
argument;
it's
really
an
independent
source
doctrine.
mr.
david
a.
moran
not
at
all,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no,
the--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--absolutely
not.
the
purpose
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule
is
to
protect
the
homeowner's
privacy
rights.
it's
one
of
the
core
parts
of
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
homes
against
unreasonable
police
invasions.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
i
think
this
court
has
described
it
well
in
the...
in
its
most
recent
cases...
in
banks
and
richards,
in
particular,
as
well
as
ramirez
and
wilson...
that
it
is
a
right
against
being
terrified
by
having
the
police
come
in.
it
is
a
right
against
being
embarrassed.
people
might
be
in
all
stages
of
undress
or
in
compromising
positions
when
the
police
come
in.
and
it
is
a
right
against
having
one's
door
destroyed.
the
english
cases,
the
early
english
cases,
first
recognized
that
it's
a
right
against
having
one's--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
the
warrant
requirement.
the
purpose
of
the
warrant
requirement
is
also
to
protect
the
sanctity
and
the
privacy
of
the
home;
it's
not
to
protect
contraband
that
one
might
have
in
the
home,
or
whatever
it
is
that
the
police
are
looking
for.
it's--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--and
i
think
the
courts
have
recognized
that
it's
necessary
to
enforce
it
that
way,
because
other
methods
of
enforcing
it
will
not
work.
but--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
think
it's--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
think
that
is
their
argument,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
respectfully
disagree
with
it.
as
a
historical
matter,
even
the
early
english
cases
recognized
that
when
an
officer
illegally
entered...
a
sheriff
illegally
entered
a
home
with
a
valid
writ,
that
officer
became
a
trespasser,
and
the
activity
that
he
performed
in
the
home
was,
therefore,
illegal.
in
the
reply
brief,
i
cited
several
early
american
cases,
from
the
1830s
and
1840s,
holding
that
when
an
officer
had
a
valid
writ
to
seize
a
debtor's
goods,
but
illegally
entered
the
home,
then
that
writ
became
no
good;
and,
therefore,
the
officer...
the
sheriff,
in
those
cases...
could
be
sued,
not
only
for
the
illegal
entry,
but
also
for
the
seizure
of
the
goods
that
he
had
a
valid
warrant,
or
a
valid
writ,
to
seize,
and
that
that--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
respectfully
disagree
that
the
entry
was
not
illegal.
i
believe
the
entry
was
illegal,
because
what
a
warrant
authorizes
an...
a...
an
officer
to
do
is
to
make
a
legal
entry.
it
does
not
allow
the
officer
to
enter
however
he
pleases;
it
allows
the
officer
to
make
an
entry
that
complies
with
the
law...
in
particular,
the
fourth
amendment.
and
so,
the
entry
was
illegal.
they
could
have
performed
a
legal
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
think,
starting
in
semayne's
case,
the
court
recognized
that
even
if
the
officer
would
have
a
right
to
knock
down
the
door
after
a
refusal
of
entry
was
obtained,
that
if
the
officer
did
not
wait
for
that
refusal,
then
the
entry
was
illegal.
and
so,
i
think
the
common
law
cases
do
support...
the
old
english
common
law
cases,
starting
with
semayne's
case...
do
support
the
notion
that
the
entry...
the
entry
does
become
illegal
if
the
officer
does
not
wait
for
the
refusal.
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
officer
did
not
wait
at
all
for
any
refusal,
candidly
admitted
that
he
went
in
as
soon
as
he
could
get
through
the
door,
as
quickly
as
he
could.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
that
michigan
still
allows
for
no
knock
warrants.
but
officers,
of
course,
can
perform
no
knock
entries
when
arriving
at
the
scene,
the
circumstances
justify
a
no
knock
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think,
in
that
case,
that
would
satisfy
the
richards
standard.
in
that
case,
the
officer
would
have
particularized
suspicions
amounting--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
don't
believe
michigan
has
a
procedure
for
granting
no
knock
warrants,
not--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
in
richards,
this
court
said
that
if
there
are
particular
facts
about
this
particular
entry
that
would
make
an
officer
have
reasonable
suspicions
that
he
is
going
to
be
shot
at
or
the
evidence
is
going
to
be
destroyed,
then
the
officer
may
dispense
with
the
knock
and
announce
requirement.
there
were
no
such
suspicions
in
this
case,
and
that's
why
the
prosecution
conceded,
at
the
outset
and
at
every
step
since,
that
it
was
a
knock
and
announce
violation.
the
officers
had
no
information
about
this
particular--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that
might
be
sufficient,
after
richards,
but
that's
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
have
none
of
those
facts
in
this
case.
they
were
serving
a
warrant,
and
they
had
no
information
that
they
were
going
to
be
in
particular
danger.
they
had
no
information,
for
example,
that
there
were
drugs,
stored
near
the
toilet,
that
were
going
to
be
flushed
down.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
think
that
would
be
an
easy
case,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
a.
moran
because
then
you
would
have
particular
facts
about
this
particular
residence
and
the
people
involved.
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
easy
case
for
a
no
knock
entry.
we--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
don't
believe
michigan
has
that
procedure.
perhaps
mr.
baughman
can
correct
me.
he's
a...
he's
with
the
prosecuting
attorney's
office.
but
i
don't
believe
michigan
has
that
procedure.
not
all
states
do
have
that
procedure.
and,
instead,
states
that
don't
have
that
procedure
simply
leave
it
to
the
officer
to
determine
if
there
are
those
facts
that
justify
a
no
knock
entry.
so,
there
are
many
entries
in
michigan,
that
occur
all
the
time,
that
do
not
comply
with
the
knock
and
announce
requirement.
and
that's
fine,
because
the
officer
does,
in
fact,
have
the
particularized
facts
justifying
a
no
knock
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
then
that
would...
this
court,
i
think,
would
have
to
reverse
richards,
because
richards
said
that
the
fact
that
it's
a
felony
drug
investigation
does
not
justify
a
blanket
exclusion
from
the
knock
and
announce
requirement.
and
this
court
unanimously
held,
in
richards,
that
the
knock
and
announce
requirement
applies
in
felony
drug
cases--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--unless--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
because
in
richards--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
law
presumes
that
homeowners
will
either
make
an
explicit
refusal,
"no",
or
will
answer
the
door;
and
primarily
that
they'll
do
the
latter.
the
presumption
of
the
homeowner
that
we're
talking
about
is
an
innocent
homeowner,
somebody
who
is
either...
has
nothing
to
do
with
whatever
the
police
are
looking
for.
there
are
many
cases
where
the
police
are
looking
for
goods
that
are
not
connected
to
the
people
who
are
home.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
it...
with...
probable
cause
is
a
standard
at
somewhere
around
50
percent,
and
a
very
large
number
of
warrants
are
executed
on
the
homes
of
people
who
have
nothing,
or
people
who...
there
is
something
that
the
police
are
looking
for,
but
they
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
it;
they're
third
party
homeowners.
and,
for
that
reason,
the
knock
and
announce
requirement
recognizes
that
many,
many
warrants...
many,
many
searches...
will
be
executed
on
the
homes
of
perfectly
upstanding,
innocent
people.
and--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
i
don't
have
any
statistics.
i'm
sure
the
fbi
keeps
statistics
on
at
least
federal
warrants.
but
it's
true
that
in
a
large
number
of
warrants,
the
police
don't
find
what
they're
looking
for,
because
probable
cause
is
a
standard
that
is
not
particularly
high.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
don't
have
any
empirical
evidence,
but
certainly
lots
and
lots
of
anecdotal
evidence,
from
reading
newspaper
accounts
of
police--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--searches.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
does,
and
i
think
it--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--survives
the
search
warrant.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
certainly
would
argue
that--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--justice
stevens,
that
probable
cause
it
not
a
very
high
standard.
and
in...
many
search
warrants
are,
in
fact,
served
on
the
homes
of
people
who
are
not
suspected,
because
they're
thought
to
be
the
place
where
stuff
was
stored,
but
not
be
the
people
who
are
suspected
of
doing
anything
wrong
in
the
first
place.
mr.
david
a.
moran
those
were
cases
in
which,
typically,
the
sheriff
was
sued
for
trespassing.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no.
there
was--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
think
things
have
changed,
justice
scalia,
since
those
common
law
days,
for
that
reason.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
justice
stevens...
i
mean,
excuse
me,
justice
scalia,
things
have
changed,
in
the
sense,
first
of
all,
that
in
those
days
there
was
a
common
law
writ
of
trespass.
if
one
were
to
file,
in
michigan,
a
complaint
for
trespass
against
the
sheriff,
one
would
be
laughed
out
of
court
today,
because
all
that
you
have
is
a
tort
suit,
which
you
have
to
show
an
extreme
violation...
i
cited
the
michigan
statute
that
requires
extreme
recklessness
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer.
the
second
point
is
that
in
those
days
the
sheriffs
were...
there
were
adequate
means
to
control
the
behavior
of
sheriffs,
because
they
were
seen
as
arms
of
the
judiciary.
that,
of
course,
was
before
the
rise
of
the
independent
police
forces
that
we
have
today.
and
so,
the
exclusionary
rule,
of
course,
was
adopted
in
the
late
1800s,
early
1900s...
in
part,
in
response
to
the
changing
circumstances
of
the
police.
the
police
were
no
longer
under
the
direct
control
of
the
judiciary;
and
so,
different
remedies
were
necessary
in
order
to
assure
compliance
with
constitutional
rights.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
at
last
count
now,
11
state
and
federal
appellate
courts
have
directly
rejected
the
michigan
supreme
court's
reasoning.
the
idaho
court
of
appeals
just
joined
the
list
2
weeks
ago,
in
a...
in
a
case
that
i...
is
not
cited,
because
it's
so
recent.
and
they
have
uniformly...
i
believe
all
11
of
those
cases
have
said
that,
"were
we
to
hold
otherwise,
the
knock
and
announce
rule
would
become
meaningless.
"
a
worry
that
this
court
expressed
in
richards.
this
court
was
very
concerned,
in
richards,
that
simply
excluding
drug
cases
from
the
knock
and
announce
rule
would
make
the
knock
and
announce
rule
meaningless.
and
these
courts
have
noted
that
statement...
the
courts
that
came
out...
this...
the
decisions
that
came
out
after
richards,
and
have
said,
"if
that
is
meaningless,
then
it
would
be
especially
meaningless
if
we
were
to
exclude
the
entire
knock
and
announce
rule
from
the
exclusionary
rule,
that
there
would
be
virtually
no
reason
for
police
officers
ever
to
comply
with
a
knock
and
announce
requirement.
"
and
so,
i
think
the
deterrence
rationale
is
a
large
part
of
this,
and
that's
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
inevitable
discovery
cases,
which
the
michigan
supreme
court
relied
on.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no,
it
is
not
enough,
but
what
is
critical
in
this
case
is
that
the
knock
and
announce
violation
goes
to
the
manner
of
entry,
and
the
court
has
long
recognized
that
the
two
predicates
for
seizure
of
goods
inside
a
home,
or
arrest
inside
a
home,
are
authority
to
enter
the
home,
which
is
not
contested
here,
and
a
lawful
entry.
and
if
either
one
of
those
two
predicates
is
missing,
then
you
have
grounds
to
suppress
the
evidence;
that
is,
the
evidence
inside
the
home
is
in
the
fruit
of
the
unlawful
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no.
first
of
all,
this
court
didn't
find
that
there
was
a
violation
in
the...
in
the
damage
in
property;
this
court
found
no...
did
not
find,
as
a
matter
of
law,
any
fourth
amendment
violation.
but
i
read
the
ramirez...
that
language
from
ramirez
as
saying
that
as
long
as
the
entry
remains
lawful...
and,
in
ramirez,
the
entry
was
lawful,
because
there
were
valid
grounds
to
dispense
with
the
knock
and
announce
requirement.
you
had
a
known
dangerous
fugitive,
who
had
bragged
that
he
wouldn't
be
taken
alive.
and
so,
there
was
every
reason
for
the
officers
to
dispense
with
the
knock
and
announce
requirement.
therefore,
the
entry
was
legal.
they
had
both
authority...
that
is,
the
warrant...
and
they
had
a
valid
entry...
that
is,
a
no
knock
entry
that
was
justified
by
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
officers
would
be
met
with
violence
if
they
did
knock
and
announce
their
presence.
and
so,
we...
in
ramirez,
we
have
a
lawful
entry.
the
language
that's
quoted
from
ramirez
directly
says,
"the
entry
remains
lawful",
or
words
to
that
effect.
and
you
have
a
different
case
if
you
had--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
moran
justice
scalia,
i
don't
see
any
language
in
ramirez
saying
that
the
breaking
of
the
window
was
unlawful.
i
think
the
breaking
of
the
window...
i
read
the
ramirez
opinion
as
saying
the
breaking--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it
wasn't...
certainly
wasn't
unconstitutional.
often,
when
the
police
perform
a
valid
no
knock
entry,
they
will
damage
property.
typically,
they
will
destroy
the
door.
and
so,
the
breaking
of
the
window
in
ramirez,
i
don't
believe
was
unlawful.
i
believe
it
was
perfectly
valid
way
for
the
officer
to
perform
the
entry;
that
is,
to
put
the
gun
through
the
window
in
the
garage
area
in
order
to
prevent...
they
believed
that
the
homeowner
had
guns
there
and
was
going
to
use
the...
run
to
the
guns
in
order
to
repel
the
entry.
and
so,
i
believe
it
was
a
perfectly
lawful
entry.
i
think
what
ramirez
was
saying
was
that
not
all
fourth
amendment
violations
bear
fruit.
and
i
agree
with
that.
we
do
not
have...
we
do
not
propound
here
a
theory
of
everything,
having
to
do
with
all
fourth
amendment
violations
and
the
fruit
that
they
propound.
we
simply
say
that,
with
a
knock
and
announce
violation
that
makes
the
entry
unlawful,
the
evidence
found
inside
the
home,
and
only
inside
the
home,
is
the
fruit
of
that
violation,
unless
there
truly
is
an
inevitable
discovery
or
independent
source
argument;
that
is,
something
independent
of
the
entry,
which
can't
be
done
here,
when
the
police
simply
barge
in
and,
in
a
matter
of
seconds,
perhaps
minutes,
find
the
evidence.
so,
the--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes,
we
presume
that
he
would
have
come
to
the
door.
he
was
just
a
few
feet
from
the
door,
in
fact.
he
was
right
in
front
of
the
door.
we
presume
that
he
would
have
come
to
the
door,
answered
the
door,
admitted
the
police,
and
the
police
would...
then
would
have
performed
the
search.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
a.
moran
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
a.
moran
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
as
to
the
evidence
that
is
causally
connected
to
the
knock
and
announce
violation,
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
remote
possibility
of
such
evidence
will
never
deter
police
officers
from
violating
the
knock
and
announce
requirement.
the
first
is
that
it's
very
remote.
i'm
not
aware
of
a
single
case
in
american
history
where
there
has
been
identified
such
evidence
that
is
directly
causally
related
only
to
the
knock
and
announce
violation.
but
the
second
reason,
more
fundamental,
is
that
even
if
there
were
such
evidence,
by
definition
the
possibility
of
finding
such
evidence
will
not
deter
the
police
from
committing
a
knock
and
announce
violation,
because
they
wouldn't
have
found
that
evidence
had
they
complied
with
the
knock
and
announce
requirement.
in
other
words,
the
police
would
only
gain
that
evidence
by
committing
the
knock
and
announce
violation,
so
there
would
be
nothing
lost
in
going
ahead
and
risking
an
excited
utterance
that
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
use,
because,
by
definition,
they
wouldn't
be
getting
that
excited
utterance,
anyway.
i
think
it's
important,
with
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
to
rebut
the
claim
that
miller
and
sabbath
had
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
there
was
no
warrant
in
those
cases.
nothing
in
miller
and
sabbath
turned
on
the
absence
of
a
warrant.
and,
in
fact,
in
miller
the
court
specifically
said,
"the
requirements
stated
in
semayne's
case
still
obtains.
"
"it
applies,
as
the
government
here
concedes,
whether
the
arrest
is
to
be
made
by
virtue
of
a
warrant
or
when
officers
are
authorized
to
make
an
arrest
for
a
felony
without
a
warrant.
"
the
government
conceded,
in
miller,
that
whether
there
was
a
warrant
or
not
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
knock
and
announce
violation
in
that
case.
mr.
david
a.
moran
perhaps
i
misread
their
brief,
justice
scalia,
but
i
thought
it
was
that
there
was
an
absence
of
a
warrant.
of
course,
this
is
an
arrest
case,
as
well.
the...
mr.
hudson
was
seized,
and
was
searched,
incident
to
arrest.
and
so,
this
was
also
an
arrest
case,
much
like
miller
and
sabbath.
as
for
the
causal
connection
argument,
if
this
court
were
to
accept
it,
i
listed,
in
my
principal
brief,
a
litany
of
cases
that
i
think
would
have
to
be
overruled...
katz,
knowles,
silverthorne
lumber...
for
that
matter,
kyllo.
all
those
cases
say
that
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
government
has
a
clear,
lawful
route
to
get
the
evidence;
the
fact
that
they
didn't
follow
that
clear,
lawful
route
prevents
the
government
from
using
that
evidence.
and
it's
impossible
to
explain
how
mr.
baughman's
causation
theory
is
consonant
with
all
of
those
cases.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
think--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
same
thing
applies
here.
i
think
that
the
knock
and
announce
rule
is
about
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
and
this
court
could
not
have
said
it
any
more
clearly
in
wilson,
that
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
or
seizure
inside
a
home
is
connected
to
the
method
of
entry.
in
fact,
the
court
said
it
three
times,
in
wilson,
in
various
ways.
and
so,
i
think
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule,
is
to
protect
the
homeowner's
right
of
privacy
against
shock,
fright,
and
embarrassment
that
can
come
with
a
precipitous
police
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no,
we
don't
dispute
that
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
finally,
i
have
to
ask
why
this
court
has
decided
all
these
knock
and
announce
cases
in
the
last
10
years,
if
my
opponents
are
right.
this
court
shouldn't
have...
they're
all
criminal
cases,
and
this
court
should
have
simply
said
the
petitioners
or
respondents,
as
the
case
may
be,
cannot
obtain
the
relief
they
are
seeking,
because
the
knock
and
announce
rule
is
not
causally
related
to
the
evidence
that
they're
trying
to
suppress.
and
so,
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
my
opponent's
position,
the
knock
and
announce
rule
will
become
a
dead
letter.
there
will
be
virtually
no
cases,
there
will
be
virtually
no
more
development
of
this
rule.
this
court
would
have
been
wrong
in
miller,
it
would
have
been
wrong
in
sabbath,
and
it
was
wrong
to
reach
the
substantive
constitutional
questions
it
reached
in
banks,
richards,
ramirez,
and
wilson.
and
all
the
other
courts,
the...
virtually
every
state
currently
suppressing
evidence
seized
after
a
knock
and
announce...
well,
they
would
have
to
be
wrong,
too.
and
so,
a
lot
of
courts,
including
this
court,
have
been
wrong
a
lot
of
times,
if
my
opponent
is
correct.
finally,
one
last
word
on
segura.
segura
is
the
sort
of
case
where
one
can
make
a
respectable
inevitable
discovery...
in
fact,
a
winning
inevitable
discovery
or
independent
source
argument.
but
the
key
thing
in
segura
is,
this
court
did
not
disturb
the
fact
that
the
evidence
that
was
seized
during
the
initial
entry
was
suppressed,
because
that
was
directly
connected
to
the
unlawful
entry.
and
so,
the
evidence
that
the
police
initially
seized,
before
the
19-hour
wait
in
segura,
was
suppressed.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
a.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
for
centuries
the
knock
and
announce
rule
has
been
a
core
part
of
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
houses
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
it
reflects
the
notion
that
when
the
government
has
the
right
to
enter
a
house,
whether
to
perform
an
arrest,
to
search
for
evidence,
or
to
seize
goods,
that
the
people
should
have
the
right
to
answer
the
door
in
a
dignified
manner,
except
in
an
emergency,
and
to
avoid
the
unnecessarily
gratuitous
embarrassment
and
shock
that
often
follows
a
precipitous
police
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
this
court
has
recognized
in
wilson,
consistent
with
the
common
law
authorities,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
they
are
connected,
that
the
entry
directly
affects
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
and
seizure
that
occurs
within.
and
that's
why
this
court
in
miller
and
in
sabbath
suppressed
the
evidence
following
knock
and
announce
violations.
but
in
wilson,
this
court
directly
stated
that
the
common
law,
the
fourth
amendment,...
the
common
law
that
informs
the
fourth
amendment,
directly
demonstrates
that
the
framers
thought
that
the
method
of
entry
directly
affects
whether
a
search
or
seizure
inside
a
home
is
reasonable.
mr.
david
a.
moran
if
there
is--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--your
honor,
the
evidence
inside...
the
evidence
is
seized
inside.
the
seizure
of
the
evidence
inside
is
directly
related
to
the
manner
of
entry,
just
as
there's
a
direct
causal
link
between
when
the
officers
come
in
without
a
warrant
when
they
should
have
gotten
a
warrant
first.
they
thought
there
was
an
exigent--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
going
back
to
wilson,
this
court
said
in
wilson,
if
i
might
quote
from
wilson,
that
the...
the
common
law
search
and
seizure
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
of
a
dwelling
may
depend
in
part
on
whether
law
enforcement
officers
announce
their
presence
and
authority
prior
to
entering.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
depends
in
part,
certainly.
there
are
other
factors
as
well,
but
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
depends
in
part.
the
issue--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--because
there
were
exceptional
circumstances,
justice
scalia,
in
segura.
mr.
david
a.
moran
a
19-hour
delay
and
a
warrant
that
was
obtained
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
initial
entry.
that
was
in
no
way
dependent
on
the
initial
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
initial
entry
was
not
the
product
of
the
later
warrant,
but
once
this
court
ruled--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
right.
the...
the
initial
entry
wasn't
lawful.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
but
this...
the
government
in
segura
never
contested
the
fact
that
the
evidence
that
was
seen
and
seized
during
the
initial
entry
should
be
suppressed.
and
that's
all
we're
asking
for
here.
mr.
david
a.
moran
when
the
officers
went
in
initially
in
segura,
some
evidence
was
seen
and
seized
at
that
time,
and
the
government
did
not
contest
that
that
evidence
should
not--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
moran
right,
but
the--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--the
entry...
the
initial
entry
was
an
unlawful
entry.
when
they
came
back
with
the
warrant--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--their
presence
was,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i...
i
read
segura
as
saying
that
the
presence...
the
later
presence
of
the
warrant,
which
was
in
no
way
tainted
by
the
initial
entry,
made
the
officers'
presence
in
the
home
retroactively
lawful
from
that
point.
it
was
unlawful
until
that
point,
which
is
why
the
government
did
not
contest
the...
the
point
that
all
the
evidence
that
was
seized
during
the
initial
entry
up
to
the
point
when
the
warrant
was
issued
had
to
be
suppressed.
that's
all
we're
asking
for
here.
i
can
imagine
hypotheticals
in
which
you
have
a
knock
and
announce
violation
and
then
something
happens
like
in
segura
or
like
in
murray,
where
you
have
later
action
that
creates
an
independent
source.
but
in
your
typical--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that
might
do
it.
that
would
be
a
different
case
than
the
case
we
have
here--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--you
would
have
to
create
some
sort
of
analogy
to
murray
and
segura.
murray
and
segura
are
exceptional
cases.
there
are
very
rare
cases
when
the
government
breaks
in
and
then
realizes
we
shouldn't
have
done
that.
we
should
go
get
a
warrant.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
and...
and
you
can
have...
imagine
such
hypotheticals
in
the
knock
and
announce
context.
and
in
the
moreno
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
you
have
one
where
you
have
a
knock
and
announce
violation
committed
in
the
outer
door.
no
evidence
is
found
in
the
outer
door,
but
then
the
officers
properly
knock
and
announce
at
the
inner
door,
and
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
that
was
proper
to
seize
that.
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
that...
that
seems
like
a
proper
result
because
ultimately
the
purposes
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule
were
vindicated
when
the
officers
knocked
and
announced
at
the
inner
door
before...
before
forcing
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
in
this
case?
mr.
david
a.
moran
from
banks,
somewhere
closer
to
15
seconds.
15
to
20
seconds
was--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--mr.
hudson
presumably
would
have
gotten
up
from
his
chair,
would
have
come
to
the
door,
would
have
admitted
the
officers,
and
then
after--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--we
presume
that
people
act
lawfully
in
response
to
commands
from
the
police.
we
do
not
presume
that
people
will
act
unlawfully.
if
the
police
have
evidence
or
information
that
someone
will,
in
fact,
act
unlawfully
by
trying
to
dispose
of
the
evidence
or
by--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--the
record
does
not
disclose
any
effort
on
mr.
hudson's
part
to
hide
any
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
rocks
of
crack
cocaine,
for
which
he
was
convicted,
were
found
in
his
left
front
pants
pocket.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
gun
was
in
the
chair.
mr.
david
a.
moran
in
the
chair.
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
secreting
of
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it's
always
possible,
your
honor,
but
we
don't
presume
that.
just
as
in
segura,
the
court
said--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--we
don't
contest
that
they
would
have
found
the
same
evidence,
no.
we
do
not
argue
that
mr.
hudson
or
any
of
the
other
people
in
the
house
would
have
destroyed
the
evidence.
mr.
david
a.
moran
we
certainly
don't
make
that
argument.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it's
not
really
clear
from
the
record,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it's
in...
in
the
chair.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i'm
not
completely
clear
exactly
where
in
the
chair
it
was.
mr.
david
a.
moran
in
the
chair.
mr.
david
a.
moran
49
of
the
50
states
currently
suppress
evidence
following
knock
and
announce
violations,
just
as
this
court
did
in...
in
miller
and
sabbath.
mr.
david
a.
moran
we
go
back
to
the
wong
sun
fruits
test.
is
the
evidence
that
was
recovered
the
direct
fruit
of
the
violation?
in
other
words,
is
there
a
clear,
logical
connection?
now,
my
opponent--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
it's
so...
it's
so
that
there
is
a...
an
obvious
connection.
before
the
court
takes
the
step
of...
of
excluding
evidence,
there
should
be
some
connection,
some
clear
connection,
between
the
violation
and
the
evidence
recovered.
but
my--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
suppose
that
it's
simply
the
matter
of
logic,
that
evidence
that's
completely
unrelated
to
a
violation
nobody
would
think
should
be...
should
be
excluded.
but
evidence--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
it's...
it's
unrelated.
so
if,
for
example,
the
police
break
into
my
house
and...
and
find
evidence...
find
nothing
in
my
house...
they
illegally
break
into
my
house,
but
then
they...
they
do
a
proper
warrant
search
of
my
office
and
find
evidence,
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
see
any
connection
between
the
illegal
search
of
my
house
and
the
legal
search
of
my
office,
assuming
that
it
was
not
the
fruit
of
the
illegal
search
of
my
house.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
exactly.
it...
the
whole
point
is
deterrence.
and
so
you
wouldn't
deter
the
officers
who
illegally
broke
into
my
house
by
excluding
the
evidence
from
my
office
if...
if...
it
may
even
well
be
different--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
it
may
well
even
be
a
different--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no,
we
don't.
mr.
david
a.
moran
we...
we
limit--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--we
do.
mr.
david
a.
moran
what
the
knock
and
announce
violation
causes,
justice
scalia,
is
the
officer
to
be
illegally
in
the
home.
going
back
to
the
common
law
authorities,
the
courts
have
long
recognized...
american
courts
have
long
recognized
that
an
officer
who
illegally
enters
a
home,
even
with
a
valid
writ
or
a
valid
piece
of
paper
allowing
him
to
be
in
the
home,
if
the
manner
of
entry
is
illegal,
he
is
a
trespasser.
his
entry
is...
is
void
ab
initio.
and
so
in
that
sense,
the
entry
is
the
cause
of
the
illegal--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--after
segura--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--again,
i--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
concede
that
it's
possible
that
you
can
come
up
with
a
segura
type
hypothetical.
i
think
the
easiest
one
is
the
moreno
case
from
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes,
i
can,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
is.
it's
an--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it's
an
independent
source.
mr.
david
a.
moran
and
that's
exactly
right.
and...
and
the
situation
we
have
in
michigan
now
is
that
officers
know
to
a
certainty
that
if
they
violate
the
knock
and
announce
rule,
nothing
will
happen.
and
so
that's
why
in
all
the
other
states--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--mr.
chief
justice,
none
of
the
parties
has
been
able
to
identify
any
cases
in
which
you
can
point
to
evidence
and
say
this...
this
evidence
was
produced
by
the
knock
and
announce
violation
and
nothing
else
in
the
house--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--if
i
may
make
two
responses
to
that.
first,
the
solicitor
general
hypothesized
such
a
case
but
has
not
identified
a
single
case
where
that's
ever
happened.
it's
purely
hypothetical.
but
the
second
point
is
that
excluding
that
evidence
would
have
no
deterrent
effect
whatsoever
because
by...
by
definition,
that's
evidence
that
the
police
would
only
get
by
committing
the
knock
and
announce
violation.
so
the
police
lose
nothing
by
risking
the
possibility
that
somebody
will
make
an
excited
utterance
and
then
say,
okay,
we
won't
get
to
use
that
excited
utterance,
but
we
would
never
have
gotten
that
excited
utterance
in
the
first
place.
that's
not
deterrence,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
restitution.
that's
like
saying
that
i
can
be
deterred
from
stealing
something
by
being
told
that
if
i'm
caught,
i'll
have
to
give
it
back.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
think
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
really
goes
to
the
worst
position
language
in
nix,
and
the
point
is,
from
our
brief,
is
that
this
court
has
placed
the
prosecution
in
the
worst
position
than
it
would
have
been
had
the
police
acted
lawfully
dozens,
possibly
scores,
of
time...
times.
all
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
noted
that
the
police
easily
could
have
obtained
a
warrant.
most
recently
in
georgia
v.
randolph,
where
this
court
noted
that
there
were
two
lawful
methods
for
the
police
to
get
the
cocaine...
the
cocaine
residue
on
the
straw,
but
still
suppressed
the
evidence.
the
police
and
the
prosecution
do
get
placed
in
a
worse
position,
and
that's
necessary
for
deterrence.
what--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it
might
well
have
been.
i
was
asked
this
question
last
time,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i'd
like
to
modify
my
answer.
in
michigan,
there
is
no
statute
governing
no
knock
warrants,
and
there's...
there
are
also
no
court
decisions
governing
no
knock
warrants.
and
there
never
will
be
under
the
people
v.
stevens
regime.
one
of
the
nice
things
that's
happened
in...
in...
since
wilson
v.
arkansas,
in
fact,
before
wilson
v.
arkansas
in
many
states,
is
courts
have
developed...
developed
procedures
for
police
officers
to
get
no
knock
warrants,
to
go
to
the
police
and
ask
for
a
no
knock
warrant.
mr.
david
a.
moran
could
the...
could
a
judge
have
issued
such
a
warrant
in
michigan?
is
that
your
question?
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
could
well--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--if
they
had
specific
information
along
those
lines,
that...
that
there
was
evidence
hidden
in
places
or...
or
stored
in
places
where
it
could
easily
be
disposed--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--in
most
states--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--most
states
do
have
statutes,
but
a
few
states
by
court
decision
have
allowed
for
the
issuance
of
no
knock
warrants.
my
point--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
moran
absolutely.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that's
right.
and
this
case
comes
to
us
in
the
posture
in
which--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it
was.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes,
after
banks
and...
and
richards,
especially
richards,
if
the
police
had
reasonable
suspicion
that
you
had
contraband
in
a
position
where
it
could
be
easily
disposed
and
if
they
had
information
about
the
weapons
that
could
be
used
to
resist
the
police
entry,
then
yes,
there
could
have
been
a...
a
legal
no
knock
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
either
would
be.
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no,
because
this
court
unanimously
foreclosed
that
argument
in
richards
v.
wisconsin
by
holding
that
there
must
be
a
particularized
showing
for
the
particular
case.
that
particularized
showing
i
will
gladly
concede
will
be
easier
to
make
in
a
narcotics
case
than
it
would
be
in
a...
in
a
stolen
property
case.
but
it
wasn't
made
in
this
case,
and
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
the
posture
that
the
prosecution
has
conceded,
at
every
step
of
the
way,
that
that
particularized
showing
was
not
made
here
and
that,
therefore,
there
was
a
knock
and
announce
violation.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that
in
this
particular
case,
it's
likely
that
the
drugs
would
be
in
an
easily
disposable
situation
and
that
the
occupants
would
be
armed
and
ready
to
resist
the
police
entry.
and
there
was
no
such
showing
made
here.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
prosecution
didn't
even
attempt
to
make
such
a
showing.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that
might
not
be
inconsistent,
but
the...
the...
to
follow
that
up
with,
therefore,
you
can
do
a
no
knock
entry
automatically
is
inconsistent
with
the
richards
decision.
the--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
i
don't
even
think
we
get
that
far,
justice
stevens.
motions
to
suppress
aren't
filed.
there's
no
point
filing
a
motion
to
suppress
except
for
the...
the
fact
that
this
case
is
pending
in
this
court.
there's
no
point
for--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it's
a
dead
letter
in
michigan.
mr.
david
a.
moran
michigan--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--michigan
has
a
particularly
vigorous
state
immunity
statute
that
makes
it
effectively
impossible
to
sue
for
a...
a
knock
and
announce
violation.
i
have
not
found
a
single
michigan
case
in
which
anyone
has
successfully
sued
for
a
knock
and
announce
violation.
you
can
sue
in
federal
court
under
section
1983,
but
there
you
run
into
various
doctrines,
especially
including
qualified
immunity.
i
made
the
claim
the
first
time
and
it
still
hasn't
been
contradicted
by
my
opponents.
we've
not
been
able
to
find
any
cases,
published
or
unpublished,
in
which
anyone
has
collected
anything
other
than
nominal
damages
anywhere
in
the
united
states--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--qualified
immunity
would
still
protect
them
to
the
extent
that
any
reasonable
officer
could
have
thought
that
a...
a
no
knock
entry
was
valid.
i
cited
a
number
of
cases,
for
example,
where
innocent
people
have
been
shot
following
entries
into
wrong
doors,
and
qualified
immunity
has
been
granted
to
the
officers.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that...
that
is
their
argument.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
assume--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no,
your
honor,
because
i
think
what
some
officers
will
do
is
exactly
what
officer
good
did
in
this
case,
which
is
shout
police
and
then
burst
in
immediately.
so
they'll
do
the
announce
part,
which
protects
the
police,
to
some
extent,
from
being
shot,
but
they
will
skip
the
rest
of
the
knock
and
announce
requirement,
which
is
to
wait
some
reasonable
amount
of
time
to
allow
the
householder
to
make
himself
more
dignified,
to
get
to
the
door,
to
answer
the
door,
to
admit
the
police
in
a
dignified
manner.
you
raise
the
point
that
lots
of
innocent
people
are
subject
to
search
warrants.
thousands
of
cases
every
year
of...
of
people
who
didn't
do
anything
either--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
from
banks,
this
court
ruled
that
15
seconds...
15
to
20
seconds
was
an
appropriate
time
for
a
drug
search.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
if
it
was
10
seconds,
justice
alito,
the
government
still
might
have
an
argument.
15
seconds
was
enough
in
banks.
the
court
did
not
say--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
that
if
the
police
are
just
very
slightly
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
line,
the
courts
are
not
likely
to
hold
that
there
was
a
knock
and
announce
violation.
but
when
you
have
a
flagrant
violation
like
here--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
in
a
case
like...
in
a...
if
a
court
were
to
hold
that
the
police
did
violate
the
knock
and
announce
requirement
by
coming
in...
by
coming
in,
by
not
giving
the
person
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
to
come
to
the
door
or
to
make
himself
presentable,
then
yes,
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed
because
those
officers
need
to
be
deterred.
the...
the
exclusionary
rule
is
all
about
deterrence,
and
is
there
any
method
that
will
deter
officers
from
violating
the
knock
and
announce
requirement
other
than
excluding
the
evidence
by
teaching
them
through
example
that
next
time
you
need
to
wait
longer?
you
need
to
wait
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
for
someone
to
come
to
the
door
unless
you
have
facts
suggesting
that
waiting
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
would
defeat
the
purposes
of
the
search.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
very
seriously
doubt
officers
such
as
officer
good
will
not
be
promoted
because
of
the
violation
that
he
committed--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
do,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
it's
inconsistent
with
mapp
in
which
the
court
recognized
that
other
remedies
have
proven
completely
futile
in
enforcing
the...
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
was
before
1983
was--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--being
used.
but
i
don't
think
section
1983
has
changed
the
landscape
here.
i...
i
don't
think
mapp
is
ripe
for
overruling,
and
in
fact,
the
criminal
justice
legal
foundation,
one
of
the
amici
for
the
other
side,
concedes
that
tort
remedies
cannot,
at
this
time,
substitute
for
the
exclusionary
rule.
if
there
are
no
other
question,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
a.
moran
thank
you--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
do,
your
honor.
the
warrant
was
never
actually
made
part
of
the
record,
but
my
understanding,
from
the
record
we
have,
was
that
only
drugs...
there
was
only
knowledge
of
drugs.
the...
the
warrant
authorized
a
search
for
guns
because
officer
good
told
the
magistrate
that
in
his
experience
guns
were
often
associated
with
drugs.
but
they
had
no
particularized
information
about
any
guns
on
the
premises.
they
only
had
particularized
information
about
drugs
on
the
premises.
the
issue
here
about
causation
goes
back,
i
think,
to
the
common
law.
and
as
justice
breyer
articulated,
when
an
officer
is
illegally
in
the
home,
that
causes
his
seizure
of
goods
or
his
arrest
of
people
in
the
home
to
be
illegal.
if
i
can
go
all
the
way
back
to
1831,
chief
justice
shaw
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
said,
the
rule
is
well
established...
this
is
1831
it
was
well
established...
that
where
an
authority
given
by
law
is
exceeded,
the
party
loses
the
benefit
of
his
justification
and
the
law
holds
him
a
trespasser
ab
initio
although,
to
a
certain
extent,
he
followed
the
authority
given.
the
law
will
operate
to
defeat
all
acts
thus
done
under
color
of
lawful
authority
when
exceeded
and
a
fortiori
will
it
operate
to
prospectively
to
prevent
the
acquisition
of
any
lawful
right
by
the
excess
and
abuse
of
an
authority
given
for
useful
and
beneficial
purposes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
might
be.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
think
that's...
that's
right
because
an...
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure,
as
this
court
held
in
wilson,
requires
a
lawful
entry.
eight
justices
agreed
that
an...
a
lawful
entry
is
the
indispensable
predicate
of
a
reasonable
search
in
ker
v.
california.
these
are
not
disconnected.
it
is
not
in.
the...
the
prosecution's
claim
here,
the
respondent's
claim,
would
eliminate
all
manner
of
entry
arguments
from
the
exclusionary
rule.
nighttime
search,
use
of
excessive
force,
blowing
up
the
building
to
get
in,
knocking
a
wall
off
the
building
wouldn't
matter.
they
were
in...
they're
in,
they
have
a
warrant,
everything
is
fine
once
they're
in.
it
simply
wouldn't
matter
for
exclusionary
purposes.
in
harris,
i
want
to
stress
again
in
harris
that
this
court
never
questioned
the
fact
that
the
evidence
found
inside
the
home
had
to
be
suppressed,
and
that's
all
we're
asking
for
here.
the
evidence
in
the
home.
