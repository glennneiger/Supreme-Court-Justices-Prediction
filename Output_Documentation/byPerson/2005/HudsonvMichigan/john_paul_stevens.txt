justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
the
hypothetical
case,
where,
three
times
before,
there
had
been
warrants
served,
and,
each
time,
the
homeowner
shot
at
the
officer,
the
fourth
time,
they
could
go
in
without
waiting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
would,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
presumption
of
innocence...
the
presumption
of
innocence
survives
an
indictment,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
probable
cause
is
not
enough
to
eliminate
the
presumption
of
innocence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
it
was
unlawful,
it
was
not
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
might
have
probable
cause,
but
just
not
have
the...
have
the
warrant.
so,
what
is
the
difference
between
having
probable
cause
to
enter,
but
failing
to
get
a
warrant,
and
having
a
warrant,
but
failing
to
knock
and
announce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
the
entry
was
lawful
or
unlawful,
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
not
the
question.
the
actually...
actual
entry
was
lawful,
yes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can
understand
the
requirement
there
be
causal
connection.
are
there
cases
in
which
courts
have
held
that
there
was
a
knock
and
announce
violation,
and
there
is
a
general
remedy
of
exclusion,
unless...
except
when
there's
a
causal
connection;
but,
in
fact,
the
evidence
was
admitted
because
it
was
not
causally
connected
to
the
entry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
i
can
understand
the
hypothetical,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
really
a
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
correct?
i
thought
in
most
states,
there
has
to
be
a
statute
that
authorizes
a
non
knock
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
most
states
do
have
such
statutes.
and
we
got
this
case
because
michigan
chooses
to
go
on
on
a
separate
path.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
as
i
understand
it,
the
prosecutor
conceded
a
violation
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
just
wondering.
in
michigan,
since
there's
no
adverse
effect
to
it,
do
the
prosecutors
routinely
concede
that
there's
a
violation
because
there's
no
point
in
litigating
it
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
the
issue
arises,
you
can
assume
the
prosecutor
will
always
say,
yes,
we'll
assume
there
was
a
violation.
there
would
be
no
reason
not
to
assume
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you'll
never
really
litigate
in
michigan
how
far
they
can
go
before
they
violate
the
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
nevertheless,
was
not
there
a
finding
that
there
was
probable
cause
that
there
was
a
gun
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about
the
practice
in
michigan?
since
people
against
stevens
and
people
against
vasquez
have
been
decided,
are
there
any
cases,
other
than
this
one,
in
which
a
prosecutor
has
raised
the
knock
and
announce
argument
that
got
litigated
all
the
way
to
the
appellate
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
but
there
really
is
no
incentive
for
the
prosecutor
to
fight...
argue
about
this
anymore
in
michigan,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
concedes
there's
a
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there's
no
point
in
litigating
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
a
functional
equivalent
of
conceding
a
violation
in
every
case
because
there's
simply
no
effective
remedy
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
effective
remedy
in
the
litigation
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
there's
always
the
possibility
that
the
officer
will
be
disciplined
by
his
very
zealous
superior,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
would
you
bother
making
the
argument?
the
evidence
can't
be
suppressed.
i
don't
understand
why...
why
would
there
ever
be
any
litigation
over
this
issue
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
can
you
cite
me
any
other
example
of
a...
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment?
maybe
we
shouldn't
have
held
it's
a
violation.
i
understand
that
argument.
is
there
any
other
area
of
fourth
amendment
law
in
which
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
followed
by
a
suppression
ruling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
your
example
it's...
stomping
up
the
stairs
is
like
failing
to
knock
and
announce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
there
should
be
a
deterrent
for
the
stomping
up
the
stairs,
and
you've
got
no
deterrent
for
the
knock
and
announce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
salmons,
may
i
ask
you
this...
this
question?
if
you'd
been
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
and
you
had...
knew
that
the
evidence
would
be
suppressed
if
there
were
a
constitutional
violation,
would
you
have
conceded
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
or
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
not
have
conceded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
not
have
conceded.
if
you...
if
you
thought
there
was
a
reasonable
argument,
you
would
not
have
conceded
that
there
was
a
violation,
would
you?
