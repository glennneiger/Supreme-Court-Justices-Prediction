justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
on
the
point
of
the
causal
relation
that
the
chief
justice
was
exploring,
i
mean,
there
is
a
causal
relation
in
a
but
for
sense.
we
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
that
the
minute
there's
an
entry
after
the
knock
violation...
the
no
knock
violation...
the
minute
there's
an
entry,
that
injury
ceases,
so
that
it's
different
from
a
warrantless
rummaging
around
through
drawers
and
so
forth.
i
suppose
that
would
be
their
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we've
been
down
this
route
before
in
other
cases,
like
wilson,
but
it's
still
a
troublesome
measure.
it's
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
if
a
person
has
drugs
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
or
on
the...
next
to
the
chair
where
he's
sitting,
that
he
wouldn't
immediately
run
and
try
to
dispose
them.
i
just
think
that
it's
ordinary
behavior.
and,
if
that's
so,
then
it
would
follow
that
you
never
have
to
knock
if
you're
looking
for
drugs
that
might
be
on
the
person.
do
you
have
any
comment
as
to
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
if
we
say
that
a
likelihood...
or
that
the...
or
substantial
probability
that
the
evidence
will
be
destroyed
allows
the
no
knock,
why
won't
that
be
true
in
every
drug
case,
other
than
for
what
we
said
in
richards?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
do
people
say,
"oh,
they've
got
me
now.
"
"i
won't
get
rid
of
the
drugs?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
when
there's
probable
cause
to
enter,
there's
no
presumption
of
innocence,
is
there,
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
in
your
view,
there
has
to
be
a
4-
to
6-hour
search
for
complex
financial
records,
business
documents.
there's
a
warrant.
the
search
is
otherwise
proper.
they
forget
to
knock.
they
say,
oh,
you
know,
we
are
police
officers.
there's
a
discussion
for
a
while.
but...
anything
seized
after
that
is...
must
be
suppressed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
just
seems
to
me
in
the
hypothetical
i
put...
and
there's
obviously
a
reason
i
put
it...
is
there's
just
no
causal
link
between
the...
the
suppression
and...
and
the
failure
to
knock.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
say
directly
related.
that...
that
assumes
the
very
point
that
i
have
in
mind.
i
don't
know
why
it's
directly
related.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
depends...
it
depends
in
part.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the...
suppose
the
officer...
excuse
me,
we
forgot
to
knock,
but
we
are
police
officers.
we
do
have
a
warrant.
we're
going
to
proceed
with
a
search.
please
don't
be
alarmed.
we're
going
to...
does
that
do
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
your...
your
point
is...
is
there...
is
that
they
have
to
go
out
and
come
back
in
again.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree.
segura...
i
forget
what
it
is
in
torts.
it's
kind
of
a
supervening,
independent
cause
or
something
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
in
this
case,
which
is
justice
ginsburg's
question?
if
the
police
said,
we
have
reasonable
grounds
to...
to
believe
that
he
has
a
weapon
and
we're
also
looking
for
drugs
that
are
easily
disposable,
would
that
be
grounds
for
knocking...
for
not...
for
dispensing
with
the
knock
requirement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
take
it
step
by
step.
suppose
the
police
articulate
this
at
the
outset--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
under...
under
state
procedures,
they're
allowed
to
make
the
on
the
spot
judgment.
would
that...
would
those
facts
suffice
to
allow
them
to
enter
without
the
knock?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
in...
in
this
case,
they
could
have
entered
in
your
view
if
they
had
specific
knowledge
of
the
gun
and
disposable
contraband.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
do
you
think
just
as
an
empirical
matter
that
in
most
cases
where
there's
known
to
be
guns
plus
drugs,
the
police
will
enter
without
knocking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's...
there's
specific
knowledge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
in
the
warrant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
still
don't
understand
where...
where
we
are
with
guns.
you...
you
have
a
specific
finding
in
a
warrant
that
says
there's
probable
cause
there's
going
to
be
a
gun,
and
there's
drugs.
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
this
allows
you
to
enter
without
knocking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
what...
what
happens
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
daytime
warrant
provision
in...
in
a
search
warrant
and
the
search
is
at
night?
do
we
suppress?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
cases...
are
there
cases
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'd
to
get
your...
i'd
like
to
get
your
position.
i...
i
think
justice
souter
is
correct,
that
under
the
theory
you're
arguing
to
us
here,
the
violation
of
the
daytime
warrant
rule
is
not
grounds
for
suppressing
evidence.
so
we
can
have
nighttime
searches
with
no
suppression
remedy.
