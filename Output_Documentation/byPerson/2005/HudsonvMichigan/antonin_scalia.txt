justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know,
i'd
be
worried...
you
know,
bust
in
somebody's
door...
that
the
homeowner
wouldn't
shoot
me.
without
announcing
that
i'm
the
police,
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
he's
under
attack.
isn't
that
a
considerable
deterrent?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
a
point
that
you
make
in
your
brief
that
civil
actions
simply
are
of
no
use.
that
might
have
been
the
case
when
we
first
adopted
the
exclusionary
rule,
but
our
docket
is
crowded
with
1983
cases
brought
by
prisoners,
brought
by
convicted
felons,
and
many
of
these
cases
are
successful
below.
what
reason
is
there
to
believe
that
that
wouldn't
be
an
adequate
deterrent?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that
same
problem
exists
if
the
consequence
is
exclusion
of
evidence.
courts
are
going
to
view
it
the
same
way.
you're
not
going
to
avoid
that
problem
by
excluding
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
mean,
your
point
is,
it's
very
hard
to
tell
whether
they
waited
long
enough,
right?
and
that's
why
they
don't
win
a
lot
of
these
cases.
but
the
same
thing
is
going
to
be
true
if
the
consequence
of
not
waiting
long
enough
is
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
the
court
is
going
to
be
very...
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
tell
if
they
waited
long
enough,
and,
as
you
say,
the
court
is
likely
to
say,
you
know,
"let
it
go".
justice
antonin
scalia
our
two
cases
did
not...
did
not
raise
that
issue.
the
issue
was
not
decided
in
those
cases,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
here
it
was
a
warrant
to
enter
the
home,
not
to
seize
particular
goods.
so,
the
entry
of
the
home
was
not
illegal.
the
entering
of
the
home
was
perfectly
okay.
what
was
illegal
was
not
knocking
and
announcing
in
advance.
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
a
different...
quite
a
different
issue,
and
the
causality
is
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
the
essence
of
the
violation
was
not
the
entering;
whereas,
in
the
cases,
the
old
common
law
cases
you're
talking
about,
the
essence
of
the
violation
was
the
entering.
here,
the
entering
was
perfectly
okay;
it
was
the
manner
of
it,
the
failure
to
give
the
advance
notice,
that
made
it
bad.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
creates
a
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
moran,
these
old
common
law
cases
you
referred
to,
which
held
that
a
failure
to
knock
and
announce
renders
the
entry
unlawful,
what
was
the
consequence,
in
those
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
the
evidence
would...
if
found,
was
not
excluded,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
if
we
wanted
to
be
faithful
to
those
common
law
cases,
we
wouldn't
exclude
the
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
shouldn't
have
cited
the
common
law
case.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
there
are
a
lot
of
other
violations
of
constitutional
rights
by
the
police
that
are
very
hard
to
get
at,
and
that
cannot
be
remedied.
and
i
suppose
we
could
punish
them
by
excluding
all
the
evidence,
as
well.
we
don't
do
so,
simply
because
there's
no
causality.
we
insist
upon
a
causal
connection
between
the
two.
it's
not
enough
just
to
say
the...
this
is
the
only
way
to
stop
the
police
from
making
the
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
our
opinion
in
ramirez,
where
the
manner
of
entry
was
such
that
there
was
damage
to
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
didn't
exclude
the
evidence
there,
did
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
had
happened?
had
they
broken
a
window
on
the
way
in?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
the
entry
remains
lawful,
despite
the
fact
that
the
manner
of
the
entry,
which
included
the
breaking
of
a
window,
was
unlawful.
i
think
what
the
court
meant
was
not,
as
you're
portraying
it,
that,
objectively,
the
entry
was
lawful.
i
think
they
were
speaking
as
a
matter
of
law,
despite
the
fact
that
the
breaking
of
the
window
was
wrong,
the
entry
was
lawful.
just
as
your
opponent
is
saying
here
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
no
knock
and
announce,
the
entry
was
lawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you...
so,
you
think
it's
possible
that
the
defendant
could
argue
that
the
evidence
should
be
excluded
because,
"had
he
knocked
and
announced,
i
would
have
run
to
the
toilet
and
flushed
it
down,
rather
than--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--"#
answering
the"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
causal.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
government's
distinction
was
based
on
the
fact
that
they
were
arrest
cases.
i
thought
that's
the
distinction
they
were
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
what...
what
do
you
do
with
our
opinion
in...
in
1986
in
segura
v.
united
states,
which
seems
to
me
to
contradict
your
assertion
that
you
cannot
separate,
for
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
the
manner
of
entry
from
the
search?
in
that
case,
the...
the
policemen
entered
without
a
search
warrant.
so
the
entry
was
clearly
a
violation.
they
left
two
officers
in
the
room
and
other
officers
went
back
and
got
a
search
warrant.
when
they
returned
with
the
search
warrant,
the
two
officers
who
were
in
the
room
proceeded
to
do
a
search,
and
we
admitted
the
evidence.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
case,
we...
we
did
succeed
in...
in
separating
the...
the
entry
from
the
subsequent
search,
and
i
don't
know
why...
why
we
can't
do
the
same
thing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
were
the
exceptional
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
still,
it
would
seem
to
me...
i
don't
know...
the
warrant
wasn't
dependent
on
the
initial
entry?
you
could
also
say
the
initial
entry
wasn't
the
product
of
the...
of
the
later
warrant.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
was
unlawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
didn't
hold...
but
we
didn't
hold
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me?
no,
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
talking
about
only
the
evidence
that...
that
was
the
product
of
the
search
conducted
after
the
warrant
was
delivered.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
evidence
was
admitted
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
entry
of
those
officers
was
an
unlawful
entry.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
no.
the...
there
was
no
subsequent
entry.
you
said
the
initial
entry
was
unlawful.
those
officers
stayed
there.
their
presence
there
was
the
product
of
an
unlawful
entry.
justice
antonin
scalia
their
presence
was
the
product
of
an
unlawful
entry,
and
nonetheless,
we
admitted
in
the...
the
material
that
they
obtained
in
the
search
after
a
warrant
had
been
obtained.
justice
antonin
scalia
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
in
the
chair
the
same
thing
as
on
the
chair?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
tell
me
something
is
in
the
chair.
did
they
stuff
it...
stuff
it
in
the
cushion
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
so
i...
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
it's
pretty
clear
you
don't
talk
of
something
as
being
in
the
chair.
it's
on
the
chair
unless
you
stuff
it
in
the
chair.
i
assume
he
stuffed
it
behind
a
pillow
or
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
english
is
english.
you
said
it
was
in
the
chair.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure
you
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you'd
deterred
him
more
if
you
threw
the
whole
case
out,
but
we
don't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we...
we
insist
that
the
deterrence
somehow
be
related--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
the...
and...
and
the
related
usually
means
that
the
acquisition
of
the
evidence
was
the
product
of
the
violation.
it
was
caused
by
the
violation.
and...
and
for
that
reason,
we
keep
it
out.
and
here,
it's...
it's
hard
to
say
that
this
was
caused
by
the
fact
that
they...
that
they
entered
in
a
few
seconds
too
soon.
so
he
would
have
answered
the
door
and
they
would
have
seen
the
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
although
you
say
it
can
be
retroactively
validated.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
in
segura,
you
can
retroactively
validate
it
by...
by
getting
a
warrant
afterwards.
could
it
be...
have
been
retroactively
validated
by
knocking
and
announcing
afterwards?
i'm...
i'm
sorry
we
came
in
too
soon,
and
they
run
back
to
the
door
and
they
knock
and
announce
and
wait...
wait
10
seconds.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
do
the
job?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
hypothetical
sounds
ridiculous
only
if
one
accepts
your
explanation
of
segura,
that...
that
it
was
somehow
a
retroactive
validation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
just
the
former
without
the
latter?
i
thought
the
former
alone
would
be
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
assume
that
lawsuits
are
allowable
if...
if
knock
and
announce
is...
is
not
observed,
and
if
you
intrude
upon
someone
in
a
state
of
undress.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
a
civil
lawsuit
bringable?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
the
government
is
not
arguing
here
that...
that
it's
valid.
it's
just
arguing
that
though
it
is
invalid,
the
punishment
for
it
should
not
be
to
let
the
criminal
go.
that's...
that's
all
they're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
punishment
for
the
invalidity
should
not
be
the...
the
inadmissibility
of
all
of
the
evidence
of
the
crime
that
was
found.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
quite
different
from
saying
that
it's...
that
it's
valid.
so
i
think
they
acknowledge
that...
that
a
lawsuit
against
an
officer
who
knowingly
dispenses
with...
with
knock
and
announce
because,
as
you
say,
he
says
there's...
there's
no
consequence,
but
there
is
a
consequence.
he
can
be
sued.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
sometimes
he
may
be
going
into
the
wrong
house
and
the
person
suing
him
may
not
be
a
criminal,
but
may
be
some...
some
innocent...
innocent
bystander.
and...
and
what
about...
you
know,
you
say
there's
no
incentive
to
knock
and
announce.
there...
there
may...
you
don't
know
any
michigan
cases
in
which
a...
a
civil
suit
has
succeeded,
but
i
know
numerous
cases
in
which
police
who...
who
burst
in
without
knocking
and
announcing
expose
themselves
to
danger,
that
is,
to
being
shot
at
by
a...
by
a
householder
who
doesn't
know
that
they
are
the
police.
isn't
that
enough
of...
of
an
incentive,
the
fact
that
you
may
lose
your
life?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about...
you
talk
about
deterrence.
what
about
their
not
getting
promoted?
i
assume
that...
that
police
departments,
even
if
you
have
some
maverick
officers,
that
the
administration
of
the
police
department
teaches
them
that
they
have
to
knock
and
announce.
or
if
it
doesn't
teach
them
that,
then
you
do
have
a
1983
cause
of
action
against
the
city,
not
just
the
officers.
and
that...
you
know,
that's
a
deep
pocket.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
know,
i'm
the
police
commissioner
and
i
have
a
policy
that
you...
you
obey
the
law,
you
knock
and
announce,
and...
and
i
know
that
this
particular
officer
disregards
it
all
the
time.
you
really
think
that's
not
going
to
go
in
his
record?
justice
antonin
scalia
mapp
was
a
long
time
ago.
it
was
before
1983
was
being
used,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
bet
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
argue
it
to
me.
it
doesn't
make
much
sense.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
citizens...
that
michiganders
are
less
litigious
than
people
in
other
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
the
mere
existence
of
suits
in
other
states
ought
to
suffice
as
something--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's...
that's
a
deterrent.
shouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
give
some
cases
first.
he's
talking
about
actual
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
isn't
it
possible
that
if
his
law
clerk
overlooked
segura,
he
overlooked
other
cases
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
unquestionably,
was
there
not,
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
segura?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
michigan.
the
police
obtained
a
warrant
to
search
the
home
of
petitioner,
booker
hudson,
for
narcotics
and
weapons.
they
found
both;
but
in
executing
the
warrant,
the
police
had
failed
to
observe
the
knock-and-announce
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment,
which
we
have
held
requires
police
to
knock,
announce
their
presence
and
give
residents
a
reasonable
wait
time
before
forcing
entry.
in
this
case,
they
did
knock;
but
they
waited
only
five
seconds
before
opening
the
unlocked
door.
the
state
conceded
that
this
was
not
long
enough.
there
are
generous
exceptions
to
the
knock-and-announce
rule,
but
the
state
did
not
contend
that
any
of
those
exceptions
applied
here.
hudson
therefore
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
that
the
police
had
found.
the
trial
court
granted
the
motion;
but
on
interlocutory
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals,
relying
on
a
michigan
supreme
court
holding
that
knock-and-announce
violations
do
not
require
suppression,
reversed.
the
evidence
was
admitted,
and
hudson
was
convicted
of
drug
possession.
we
granted
certiorari
solely
to
consider
the
remedial
question,
whether
a
violation
of
the
knock-and-announce
rule
invokes
the
exclusionary
rule.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
michigan.
as
a
general
matter,
suppression
of
evidence
has
always
been
our
last
resort,
not
our
first
impulse.
we
have
always
acknowledged
the
substantial
social
costs
associated
with
the
exclusionary
rule,
among
them,
allowing
the
guilty
to
escape
punishment
because
of
government
errors
and
setting
loose
dangerous
individuals
upon
society.
to
invoke
the
exclusionary
rule,
our
cases
require
three
showings:
first,
that
the
constitutional
violation
be
a
but-for
cause
of
obtaining
the
evidence;
second,
that
the
causation
not
be
attenuated;
and,
third,
that
exclusion
of
the
evidence
be
the
only
effective
deterrent
of
the
constitutional
violation.
we
think
hudson
meets
none
of
these
three
tests:
first,
the
illegal
manner
of
entry
here
was
not
a
but-for
cause
of
the
police’s
obtaining
the
evidence.
the
police
had
a
valid
warrant
that
authorized
them
to
go
inside
and
take
drugs
or
guns
if
they
found
them.
whether
they
waited
5
seconds
or
25
seconds,
they
would
have
found
the
guns
and
drugs;
second,
even
assuming
that
there
was
causation,
it
was
to
attenuate
it,
because,
as
we
have
held,
“the
penalties
visited
upon
the
government,
and
in
turn
upon
the
public
because
its
officers
have
violated
the
law
must
bear
some
relation
to
the
purposes
which
the
law
is
to
serve”.
the
purpose
of
the
knock-and-announce
rule
is
threefold:
it
protects
human
life
and
limb.
if
an
officer
bursts
into
one’s
home,
any
citizens
will
assume
him
to
be
a
criminal
and
may
reach
for
a
weapon
of
their
own;
second,
the
rule
protects
property.
if
citizens
are
asked
to
open
the
door
for
law
enforcement,
they
will
save
themselves
the
expense
of
having
to
buy
a
new
door
or
a
new
door
frame;
and,
third,
the
rule
protects
the
privacy
and
dignity
that
may
be
destroyed
by
a
sudden
entrance.
as
one
of
our
prior
cases
put
it,
“the
brief
interlude
between
announcement
and
entry
with
a
warrant
may
be
the
opportunity
that
an
individual
has
to
pull
on
clothes
or
get
out
of
bed”.
none
of
these
three
interests
relates
to
preventing
the
police
from
seizing
evidence.
that
is
the
interest
protected
by
the
warrant
requirement,
and
there
was
a
warrant
here.
finally,
coming
back
to
the
last
of
the
three
requirements
for
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
the
deterrent
benefits
of
exclusion
in
this
context
seem
to
us
minimal,
and
other
determinants
of
knock-and-announce
violations
already
exist.
we
must
balance
this
slight
deterrence
benefit
against
the
costs
the
exclusionary
rule
imposes.
in
addition
to
the
usual
cost
of
setting
the
criminal
free,
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
here
to
knock-and-announce
violations
will
produce
a
flood
of
knock-and-announce
claims
by
defendants
entering
a
cost-free
lottery
with
a
get-out-of-jail-free
card
as
the
prize,
and
resolving
those
claims
will
not
be
as
easy
as
resolving
a
claimed
violation
of
the
warrant
requirement.
there
either
was
a
warrant,
or
there
was
not.
but
how
long
is
a
reasonable
wait
time,
and
precisely
how
many
seconds
did
the
police
actually
wait?
rather
than
deterring
misconduct,
the
exclusionary
rule
would
more
likely
deter
proper
police
conduct.
aware
that
a
finding
that
they
violated
the
knock-and-announce
rule
could
lead
to
a
violent
criminal’s
release,
the
police
may
be
inclined
to
wait
too
long,
giving
criminals
an
opportunity
to
run
to
the
bathroom
and
flush
their
drugs
away
or
to
load
their
weapons
and
take
aim
at
the
police.
as
for
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
applying
the
exclusionary
rule,
to
begin
with,
we
doubt
that
there
is
much
incentive
to
violate
the
knock-and-announce
rule
anyway.
the
rule
is
subject
to
a
broad
exception,
we
have
held.
whenever
the
police
have
a
mere,
“reasonable
suspicion”
that
knocking
and
announcing
would
be
dangerous,
or
would
permit
destruction
of
evidence.
when
the
police
have
no
such
suspicion,
it
seems
unlikely
that
they
would
prefer
to
burst
in
rather
than
wait
a
few
more
seconds,
often
for
their
own
benefit.
and
lastly,
other
remedies
exist
for
cases
in
which
the
rule
is
violated.
the
exclusionary
rule
was
initially
applied
against
states
in
1961,
half
a
century
ago,
in
an
environment
quite
different
from
today’s.
there
were
no
real
remedies
for
police
misconduct.
by
contrast,
section
1983
in
our
opinion
in
a
case
called
bivens
now
permit
damage
actions
in
federal
courts
against
state
and
federal
officers.
courts
regularly
entertain
such
actions
on
knock-and-announce
violations.
section
1988
authorizes
attorneys’
fees,
which
is
a
deterrent
by
itself.
there
has
been
a
substantial
increase
in
the
numbers
of
public-interest
lawyers
willing
to
assist
in
such
lawsuits
since
we
first
adopted
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
policing
has
become
a
much
more
professional
enterprise,
providing
police
review
boards
and
the
deterrents
of
a
bad
record
and
denied
promotion
for
the
police
violator.
part
iii
of
the
opinion,
the
only
part
not
shown
by
justice
kennedy,
explains
why
three
of
our
prior
cases
demand
the
result
we
have
reached
here.
for
these
reasons,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
michigan;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
