if

if
i
understand
what
the
situation
is,
there
is
no
death
penalty
in
kansas
as
a
result
of
this
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
there
been
any
movement
in
the
legislature
to
change
the
law
so
you
won't
be
in
this
situation
where
there
is
no
death
penalty?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you...
are
you...
the...
the
argument--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
is
a
brief
from
the
kansas
law
professors,
and
this
is
the
instruction
from
the
kleypas
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
aggravators
are
not
outweighed
by
the
mitigators,
you
shall
impose
the
death
penalty,
not
that
you
may,
not
that
you
can,
but
that
you
shall
impose
the
death
penalty.
this
is
the
duty
you
were
sworn
to
uphold.
shows
command.
it
means
must.
that's...
is
that
the
type
of
instruction--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
type
of
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
it...
is
it
like
in
a...
in
a...
take
a
civil
case
where
the
judge
gives
the
standard
charge
about,
"imagine
two
plates
and
a
scale,
and
if
they
are
in
equipoise,
then
you
find
against
the
party
who
has
the
burden
of
proof.
"
--if
we
make
that
comparison,
then
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendant
if
the
answer
is...
to
the
equipoise
question
is,
"then
you
must
come
in
with
a
death
verdict.
"
