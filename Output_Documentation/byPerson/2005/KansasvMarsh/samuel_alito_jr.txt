justice

alito,

is
there
a
difference
in
the
moral
burden
on
the
jurors,
or
the
psychological
burden
on
the
jurors,
in
the
situation
where
they
have
to
find
that
the
aggravators
outweigh
the
mitigators,
and,
therefore,
make
an
affirmative
finding
that
leads
to
the
sentence
of
death,
as
opposed
to
the
situation
where
they
can
say,
"we
can't
decide,
under
the
applicable
burden
of
proof,
which
side
is
weightier.
"
and,
therefore,
they
allow
a
default
rule
to
dictate
what
the
sentence
is
going
to
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
if
they
find...
if
they
agree,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
aggravators
and
the
mitigators
are
in
equipoise,
then
they
allow
the
default
rule
to
dictate
the
sentence
of
death.
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
it
be
constitutional
if
the
kansas
statute
said
that,
"the
jury
must
find,
by
a
preponderance,
that
the
aggravating
factors
outweigh
the
mitigating
factors?
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
wouldn't
a
defendant
be
better
off
under
the
current
kansas
statute
than
under
a
statute
like
that,
where,
under
the
current
statute,
the
jury
has
to
find,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
aggravating
factors
and
the
mitigating
factors
are
at
least
in
equipoise?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
mean--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--suppose
the
jury
thinks
that
the
aggravating
factors
outweigh
the
mitigating
factors
51-49.
now,
under
the
first
statute
that
i
hypothesized,
that
would
result
in
a
verdict
of
death,
would
it
not?
what
would
the
result
be
under
the...
under
the
current
kansas
statute,
where
the
aggravators
have
to
be
shown,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
to
outweigh
the
mitigators?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
there
a
particular--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--was
there
a
reason
why
they
provided
that,
in
the
case
of
equipoise,
the
sentence
would
be
death?
or
is
that
just
a
quirk
of
the
way
the
provision
was
written?
