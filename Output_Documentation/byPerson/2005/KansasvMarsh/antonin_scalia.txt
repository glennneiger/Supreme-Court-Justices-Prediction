justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
has
made
a
judgment
that
this
particular
offense...
what's
it
called?
aggravated
murder,
you
know,
whatever--
justice
antonin
scalia
--capital
murder,
as
its
name
implies,
warrants
a
judgment
of
death
unless
there
are
mitigating
factors
that...
which
indicate
that
that
is
not
proper.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
moral
judgment,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
even
if
the
state
had
said
the
opposite,
it...
it
is
a...
still
a
state
prescribed
moral
judgment.
if
the
state
had
said
capital
murder
warrants
a
judgment
of
death
only
if
the
mitigating
factors
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors,
that's
still
a
state
prescribed
moral
judgment,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
furman...
the...
it's
hard
to
tell
where
the
voice
is
coming
from,
i
know.
we
ought
to
get
that
fixed.
[laughter]
the
furman
narrowing
is
produced
by
the
very
first
part
of
subsection
(e).
if,
by
a
unanimous
vote,
the
jury
finds
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
one
or
more
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
enumerated
in...
in
section
24-4625
and
amendments
thereto
exist...
that's
the
furman.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
beyond
that
you
say
if
that
is
found,
then
the
jury
has
to
find
that
the
existence
of
such
aggravating
does
not
outweigh.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
idea
what
that
means.
i
mean,
you...
you
go
into
this
very
elaborate
system,
you
know,
molecules
on
one
side,
molecules
on
the
other.
[laughter]
and
then
you
throw
the
whole
thing
up
in
the
air
and
say
mercy
alone
is
enough.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
ms....
ms.
woodman,
you
know,
i...
i
have
not,
you
know,
gone
along
with...
with
most
of
our
walton
jurisprudence
anyway,
but...
but
what
i
have
really
always
thought
it
demanded
was
really
nothing
more
precise
than
that
a
jury
has
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
grant
mercy.
i...
i'm
not
sure
i
would
describe
any
of
it
as
any
more
precise
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
jury
has
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
say
this
poor
devil
doesn't
deserve
the
death
penalty.
however
you
want
to
put
that,
you
know,
you
can
put
the
burdens
here,
the
burdens
there.
you
can
talk
about
equipoise
or
not.
does
the
jury
have
a
chance
to
say
this...
this
fellow
does
not
deserve
the
death
penalty?
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
clearly
exists
under
this
scheme,
it
seems
to
me.
any
jury
that...
that
really
thinks
this
person
should
not
go
to
death
can...
can
do
it.
in
fact,
you
know,
i
guess
the
statute
does
not
demand
that
instruction,
but
that
instruction
that
says...
what
is
it?
the
appropriateness
of
the
exercise
of
mercy
can
itself
be
a
mitigating
factor.
i
mean,
gee,
what...
what
else...
what
else
do
you
have
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
jury
that
thought
this...
this
person
did
not
deserve
death
would
have
ample
opportunity
to
give
expression
to
that
determination
under
this
scheme.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore,
they
shouldn't
consider
mitigating
at
all,
he
told
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is
this
mercy
instruction
always
given?
is
that
standard?
is
it...
is
it,
in
effect,
that...
that
mercy
is...
is
always
one
of
the
mitigating
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i...
i
really
don't
see
what...
what
complaint
you
have
then.
any
jury
that...
that
thinks
this
person
deserves
mercy
says,
i
think
he
deserves
mercy,
and
that's...
that's
a...
a
mitigating
circumstance
that
outweighs
whatever
aggravating
circumstances
there
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
state
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
said
that?
excuse
me.
that...
that
description
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
doesn't
really
say
that,
does
it?
but
i
mean,
what
the
statute
says
is
that
if
it's
in
perfect
equipoise,
the
state
loses
because
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the...
that
the
mitigators
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravators.
it
seems
to
me
if
a
jury
sees
them
in
perfect
equipoise,
the
jury
would
have
to
say
the
state
has
not
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
mitigators
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravators.
isn't
that
what
a
jury
would
have
to
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
okay.
and...
and
if
the
jury
cannot
decide
whether
the
aggravators
are
outweighed
by
the
mitigators,
if
they're
in
perfect
equipoise,
who
loses?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
the
state
loses.
it's
the
state
that
has
the
burden
of
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
they
are--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
how
could
the
issue
be
pressed?
i
mean,
it
had
already
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court.
i
mean,
what...
what
could
the
state
say
to
the
trial
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
this...
you
think
the
state
has
to
challenge
as
unconstitutional
a
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
in...
in
the
lower
court,
lower
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
expect
the
lower
state
court
to
come
out
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
little
different
from
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
argument.
you're...
you're
now
making
a...
a
waiver
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
we...
we
don't
need
a
presumption
here.
i
mean,
the...
the
only
basis
for
inquiring
into
severability
is
the
presumed
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
that's
the
only
basis
why
severability
comes
up.
we
don't
have
to
presume
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
redecided
it.
it...
it
was
the
postulate
of...
of
its...
necessary
postulate
of...
of
its
decision
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
kleypas
didn't
hold
that
the
whole
statute
was
bad.
kleypas
gave
a
savings
construction
of
the
statute,
as
i
recall.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
the
state
can
get
mouse
trapped
in
this
way.
in...
in
the
first
case,
it
doesn't
take
the
case
up
because
not
too
much
has
been
lost,
and
then
in
the
second
case,
the
court
says,
oh,
by
the
way,
everything
has
been
lost.
and
you
say
that
we
can't
review
that
because...
because
the...
the
state
didn't...
didn't
challenge
kleypas
at
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that
decision
in
this...
they
had
no
reason
to
challenge
it
until
the
state
decided
to...
to
change
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
like
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i'm
sorry,
what
instruction
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
got--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
one.
it's
the
other
one.
it
was
instruction
number--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
gotcha.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
way
at
the
end
of
4,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it
sounds
different
if
you
put
it
differently.
surely,
it's
a
reasoned
moral
response
to
say,
"we
have
found
these
horrible
aggravating
factors
in
this
murder.
"
"it's
not
even
your
usual
murder.
"
"there
are
these
terrible
aggravating
factors.
"
"three
of
them,
we
found.
"
"and
we
further
find
that
there
is
no
mitigating
evidence
to
outweigh
those
aggravating
factors.
"
that
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
valid
moral
response.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
seems
to
me
that
to
be
equal
in
weight
is
not
to
predominate.
and
that's
all
the
jury
is
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
there's
nothing
to
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
of
course--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
jury
doesn't
have
a
free
falling
moral
judgment
to
make.
it
accepts
the
judgment
of
the
majority
of
the
people
in
kansas
that
certain
aggravators,
and
only
those
aggravators,
shall
be
counted
against
the
defendant--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
all
of
them
shall
be...
even
if
the
juror
himself
does
not
believe,
morally,
that
this
particular
aggravator
ought
to
be
there.
so,
it's
not
as
though
our
law
says
that
somehow
the
jury
has
to...
each
juror
has
to
be
able
to
make,
like
solomon,
his
own
moral
judgment
on
this
fellow.
and
one
of
the
things
that
the...
that
the
kansas
law
prescribes
is
that
when
they're
in
equipoise,
the
people
of
kansas
think
that
the
aggravators
that
they
have
specified
are
serious
enough
that
unless
there
is
something
to
overcome
them,
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate.
that
seems
to
me
a
moral
judgment
within
the
limited
range
of
moral
judgment
that
the
jury
is
accorded.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
"presumption".
it
certainly...
it
certainly
says
that
unless
you
find
something
that
outweighs
this,
the
death
penalty
is
the
proper
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
burden
is
on
the
jury
to
find
something
to
outweigh
it.
and,
in
the
absence
of
a
finding
of
something
that
outweighs
it,
when
these
aggravators
are
found,
the
death
penalty
is
the
proper
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
goes
to
your
response
to
justice
souter's
last
question?
as
i
understand
the
scheme...
maybe
my
understanding
is
wrong...
once
they
have
found
the
existence
of
those
aggravating
factors
that
justify
the
death
penalty,
and
then
you
move
into
the
penalty
phase
for
them
to
decide
whether,
in
fact,
the
death
penalty
would
be
imposed,
it's
not
up
to
them
to...
they
can't
eliminate
one
of
those
aggravating
factors
that
has
been
found.
they
have
to
take
into
account
all
of
the
aggravating
factors
that
have
been
found.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
disagree
from
your...
with
your
friend
on
the
other
side
on
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
we
check
on
that?
no,
he
said
that
a
number
of
other
state
statutes
would
be
affected
by
our
coming
out
the
way
you
would
like
us,
on
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
he
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
said
it
would
change
walton,
and
that
would
impair
those
other
state
statutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
your
argument,
but
presumably
the
attorney
general
will
tell
us,
in
his
rebuttal.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
an
aggravating
circumstance?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
i
think...
i
think
the
chief
justice's
point
is
that
you're...
you're
really
not
being
accurate
when
you
say,
"the
jurors
can
thereby
avoid
the
difficult
choice.
"
they
don't
avoid
the
difficult
choice.
they're
fully
aware,
under
this
statutory
scheme,
that
if
they
don't
find
that
the
mitigators
outweigh,
they
are
condemning
this
person
to
death.
that's
the
moral
choice
they're
faced
with.
and
when
they
come
in
with
that
verdict,
they
know
what
they're
doing.
and
i
consider
that
a
moral...
a
moral
judgment
on
their
part.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
a
juror
who
believes
that
this
person
shouldn't
be...
shouldn't
be
sent
to
death...
that
is
to
say,
who
believes
that
the
mitigators
outweigh
the
aggravators...
would
join
a
jury
verdict
which
produces
the
result
that
he's
sentenced
to
death,
right?
i
think
that
is
so
unlikely--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
he's
going
to
say,
"well,
i...
you
know,
i
think
he
shouldn't
go
to
death,
but
the
aggravators
and
mitigators
are
absolutely
evenly
balanced,
so
i
guess
i've
got
to
send
him
to
death.
"
i
don't
think
any
juror's
going
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
takes
only
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
takes
only
one
to
disagree.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
still
conclude,
as
they
did
before,
that
when
these
aggravating
factors
are
found,
unless
there
is
mitigation
to
overcome
them,
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
people
of
kansas
that
this
person
is
deserving
of
death?
what
if
they
come
to
that
conclusion
again?
you
want
us
to
tell
them,
"no,
the
people
of
kansas
cannot
come
to
that,
what
seems
to
me,
quite
rational
decision?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
so
silly
to
say
that
kansas
can
circumscribe
the
moral
judgment
of
the...
of
the
jury
by
saying,
"you
can
take
into
account
18
aggravators,
or
else
only
two
aggravators.
"
that
is
a...
you
know,
a
significant
control
on
their
moral
judgment.
but
then
to
say
that
kansas
cannot
circumscribe
their
moral
judgment
to
the
very
limited
degree
of
saying,
"unless
you
find
that
the
mitigators
outweigh
the
aggravators,
the
proper
response
is
the
death
penalty.
"
