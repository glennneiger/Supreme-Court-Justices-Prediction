justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
means
they
comply
with
lockett.
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
that
goes
back
to
your
colloquy
with
justice
souter
and
justice
scalia.
justice
scalia
pointed
out
that
the
state
has
made
a
moral
judgment
on
a
certain
state
of
facts,
the
death
penalty
shall
be
imposed
and
which
you
agreed
with.
and
that
was
true
in
the
cases
back
in
1975
and
'6.
there
were
some
state
statutes
that
mandated
death
based
on
the
moral
judgment
of
the
state
in
certain
circumstances.
i
think
one
was
a
north
carolina
statute.
do
you
ask
us
to
reexamine
those
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it...
it
does
not
rely
on
the
proposition
that
there's
a
situation
in
which
there's
a
mandated
death
penalty
which
is
perfectly
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
aggravators...
it
would
be
permissible
for
a
state
to
include
the
aggravators
necessary
to
narrow
the
category
in
the
definition
of
the
crime
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
say
that
if
the
state
met
that
burden
and
there
was
no
mitigating
or
no
substantial
mitigating
evidence,
it
would
be
permissible
to...
for
the
state
to
mandate
the
death
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that's
fully
consistent
with
the
north
carolina
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it...
that's
the
way
justice
blackmun
interpreted
the
majority,
but
the
majority
didn't
quite
say
that
because
it
said
the
burden
on
the
defendant
was
to
prove
sufficient
mitigation
to
justify
something
other
than
the
death
penalty.
and
conceivably
one
could
have
met
that
burden
with
substantial
mitigating
evidence
that
came
out
even.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
majority's
opinion...
now,
you're
dead
right
about
what
justice
blackmun
said,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
would
agree
that
it
would
be
consistent
with
the...
the
text
of
the
majority
opinion
to
say
it
really
meant
they
have
to
prove
enough
mitigating
evidence
to
make
death
the
inappropriate
sentence,
which
could
be
less
than...
even
a
50/50
balance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
wouldn't
be
true
if
you
amended
the
statute,
would
it?
if
you...
if
they
amended
the
statute
to
take
the
50/50
problem
out
of
it,
which
wouldn't
seem
to
me
all
that
difficult,
you
could
still
impose
the
death
penalty
on
these
other
12
people
who
haven't
been
tried.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
of
an
ameliorating
amendment
to
the
death
penalty
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
doubt
if
you'd
take
that
position
if
they
did
it.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
woodman,
you
said
that
they
didn't
make
such
an
argument
in
this
case
and
in
some
other
case,
but
you
did
not
include
the
argument
in
the
joint
appendix,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
kansas
supreme
court
thought
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
might
point
out...
i
just
looked
at
the
question
presented.
it
does
assume...
and
i
guess
is
drafted
by
the
kansas
attorney
general.
the
question
is
what
happens
when
mitigating
and
aggravating
evidence
is
in
equipoise.
so
the
assumption
on
which
we
took
the
case
is
that
there
will
be
cases
in
which
there's
equipoise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
they
have
come
out
the
same
way
if
they
never
mentioned
the
federal
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
cannot
do
that
by
determining
that
they're
in
equipoise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
the
very
issue
your...
your
petition
presents
us
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
question
and
kind
of
cut
through...
is
it
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
instructions,
as
a
whole,
to
say,
in
effect,
"if
you
find
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
are
equally
balanced,
you
shall
impose
the
death
sentence?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
kline,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
supposing
the
law
was
that
you're
supposed
to
be
instructed
that,
"unless
the
mitigating
factors
substantially
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors,
the
sentence
shall
be
death.
"
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
my
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
it
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it
approaches
the
problem.
i'm
wondering
if
it
gets
there.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
the
jurors
are
deadlocked,
six
to
six,
and
you're
not...
you
don't
know,
maybe
some
are
a
little
stronger
there,
but
there's
a
deadlock.
and
what
if
the
judge
told
them,
"well,
in
the
event
of
a
deadlock,
you
resolve
it
by
flipping
a
coin.
"
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mentioned
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--kansas
legislature.
has
there
been
any
suggestion
the
statute
ought
to
be
amended
to
get
rid
of
this
silly
little
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
mean
to
call
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--silly
little
problem,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
very
narrow--
