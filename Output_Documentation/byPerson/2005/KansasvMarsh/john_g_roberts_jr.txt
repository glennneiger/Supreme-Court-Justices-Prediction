chief

john
g.
roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
kansas
v.
marsh.
general
kline.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
the...
the
instructions
don't
tell
the
jury
to
weigh
the
molecules.
they
tell
the
jury
that
the
state
has
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
mitigating
molecules
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
molecules.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
how
likely
is
it,
if
you
have
a
jury
who
thinks
the...
a
juror,
who
thinks
the
molecules
are
precisely
balanced,
is
going
to
conclude
that
the
state
has
carried
its
burden
of
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
50
here
don't
outweigh
the
50
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
theoretical
proposition--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
general.
ms.
woodman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
one
of
those
cases
where
it's
too
hard
to
decide
is
when
there
are
50
molecules
on
one
side
and
50
on
the
other?
in
other
words,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that's
an
easy
case
to
say
that
the
state
has
not
met
its
burden
of
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
mitigating
factors
don't
outweigh
the
aggravating
ones
when
the
evidence
is
evenly
balanced.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what...
what
is
the
statutory
equipoise
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
my
question.
there
is
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
is
no
statutory
equipoise
provision.
the
state
has
a
burden
of
proof
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
mitigating
factors
don't
outweigh
the
aggravating.
that's
what
you
mean
by
the
statutory
equipoise
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
the...
the
formula
is
that
the
issue
has
to
either
have
been
raised
or
decided.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
don't...
i
don't...
excuse
me.
i
don't
understand
how
that
makes
any
sense.
if
you
had
an...
a...
a
case
that's
litigated
entirely
on
state
law
grounds
and
in
the
state
supreme
court
opinion,
they
announce
we
are
sua
sponte
deciding
this
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
constitution
and
you,
state,
lose,
your
argument
is
that
the
state
is
just
out
of
luck.
they
can't
seek
review
of
that
decision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
woodman.
general
kline,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
kline.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
04-1170,
kansas
versus
marsh.
general
kline.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
know
that
as
a
fact?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
have
a
return
of
a
verdict
saying,
"we
find
these
factors
in
equipoise?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where
this
is
a
theoretical
possibility
under
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
a
situation
where
this
is
what
the
jury
has
said.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
not
talking,
just...
we're
not
talking
about
a
numerical
equipoise.
i...
there's
three
aggravators
and
three
mitigators,
in
equipoise.
and
the...
presumably,
the
individual
jurors
can
give
what
weight
they
think
is
appropriate
to
the
mitigating
factors.
they
can
find
all
three
aggravators
met,
and
say,
"well,
i
still
think,
under
factor
18,
that
mercy
ought
to
outweigh
death.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
they
have
unfettered
discretion
with
respect
to
the
mitigating
factors,
don't
they?
under--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--under
factor
18,
any
other
circumstance
which
they
find
serves
as
a
basis
for
a
sentence
other
than
death.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
kline.
ms.
woodman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
how
realistic
is
that
as
a
possibility
when
you're
talking
about
abstract
concepts
as
mitigating
factors,
like
how
much
mercy
should
be
shown?
i
mean,
do
you
really
think
there's
any
juror
who's
going
to
say,
"all
right,
i'm
giving...
i've
found
the
aggravating
circumstance
that
he
killed
two
people,
and
i've
found
the
aggravating
circumstance
that
it
was
particularly
heinous
to
slash
the
throat
and
leave
the
toddler
to
burn.
"
"but
i
also
think
that
mercy
ought
to
be
shown.
"
"but,
you
know,
it
just
happens
to
come
up
to
exactly
the
level
of
the
aggravating
circumstances.
"
"so,
i'm
stuck.
"
"i
don't
know
what
to
do.
"
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
jurors
would
react.
they
either
think
that
the
need
to
show
mercy
or,
the
one
before
that,
that
he's
a
talented
artist,
outweighs
the
fact
of
the
aggravating
circumstances,
or
it
doesn't.
i
just
think
it's
an
unrealistic
supposition.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute...
they
don't
get
an
equipoise
instruction.
so,
how...
i
mean,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
jurors
do
come
to
that
balance
between
such
inchoate
concepts
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
your
analogy
took
away
what
i
would
have
regarded
as
the
basis
for
my
question.
i
think
it
may
well
be
true
that
people
have
difficulty
deciding
between
two
portraits.
i'm
not
sure
people
come
to
the
sense
that
someone
who's
guilty
of
allowing
a
19-month-old
to
burn
to
death
and
slashing
the
throat
of
her
mother
thinks
it's
equally
balanced
when
they're
inclined
to
show
mercy,
for
whatever
reason.
it
seems
to
me
they
either
make
a
determination
that
the
circumstances
of
his
upbringing,
emotional
instability
outweigh
the
responsibility
for
what
they
have
found
to
be
aggravating
factors,
or
they
determine
that
the
aggravating
factors
outweigh
the
fact
that
they
may
show
mercy
for
other
basis.
i
just...
i
can
see
thinking
two
portraits
are
indistinguishable.
i
just
don't
see
a
juror
functioning
and
saying,
"i
just
can't
decide
whether
to
show
mercy
or
to
convict
for
death.
"
and
they're
equally
balanced.
i
understand
the
idea
they
may
debate
it
with
the
other
jurors,
but,
to
come
and
say,
"you
know,
i
just
can't
decide.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
particularly
since
they
can
put
as
much
weight
into
the
mitigating
factors
as
they
want...
they
can
say,
"i
want
to
show
a
lot
of
mercy.
"
they
can
say,
"i
want
to
show
a
little
bit
of
mercy.
"
--but
to
say
that,
"i
want
to
show
just
enough
mercy
that
is
exactly
balanced.
"
i
don't
understand
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
verdict
that
the
jury
returns
is
a
verdict
of
death.
they
do
not
return
a
verdict
saying,
"we're
in
equipoise",
and
then
the
death
sentence
is
imposed
by
operation
of
law.
the
verdict
imposed
is,
"we
do
not
find...
we
find
these
aggravating
circumstances.
"
"we
find
they're
not
outweighed.
"
"and,
therefore,
we
sentence
the
defendant
to
death.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
how
is
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--how
is
it...
is
there
any
question
about
how
it's
going
to
come
out
when
they
take
it
up
again?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
woodman.
general
kline,
you

minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
kline.
the
case
is
