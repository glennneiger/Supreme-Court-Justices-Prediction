mr.
phill
kline
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
court
has
never
held
that
a
specific
structure
for
weighing
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
is
required
by
the
eighth
amendment.
yet,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
all
that
is
required
by
the
eighth
amendment
is
for
states
to
afford
an
opportunity
to
jurors
to
consider
all
mitigating
evidence
relevant
to
determination
of
a
sentence
other
than
death.
the
kansas
statute,
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case,
allowed
the
respondent
to
introduce
all
such
evidence
and
that
the
jurors,
under
kansas
law,
are
specifically
instructed
to
consider
all
such
mitigating
evidence
on
an
individualized
basis.
mr.
phill
kline
as
the
court...
yes.
as
the
court
has
done
in
walton,
the
standard
in
the--
mr.
phill
kline
--well,
to
take
the
issue
in
its
total
context
and
refer
to
the
instructions
and
the
totality
of
what
the
jury
is
instructed,
i
would
disagree
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
death--
mr.
phill
kline
--the
jury
is
given
in
the
instruction,
instruction
number
4
and
instruction
number
5,
a
direction
as
to
the
effect
of
their
reasoned
moral
judgment.
mr.
phill
kline
instruction
number
5
does
instruct
the
juror,
justice
souter,
that
if
the
state
meets
the
burden
of
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
mitigating
factors
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors,
then
the
jury
shall
sentence
the
defendant
to
death.
mr.
phill
kline
first,
they
have
to
be
convicted,
justice
scalia,
of
capital
murder.
mr.
phill
kline
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
phill
kline
that
certainly
is,
and--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct.
mr.
phill
kline
there...
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
there
are
several
considerations
and
steps
that
must
be
approached
and
proven
by
the
state
before
we
get
to
that
actual
equation.
first
of
all,
the
state
follows
the
guided
discretion
standard
of
this
court,
as
laid
out
in
furman
and
its
progeny,
to
a
very
narrow
definition
of
what
capital
murder
is.
in
fact,
the
kansas
death
penalty
statute
is
one
of
the
most
narrow
in
the
nation.
and
then
past
that
point
to
the
sentencing
jury,
the
state
must
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
least
one
of
eight
specific
aggravating
factors
exist
with
jury
unanimity.
and
then
past
that
point,
kansas
has
complied
with
this
court's
requirement
under
the
eighth
amendment
for
a
juror
to
consider
and
give
effect
to
all
mitigating
evidence
relevant
to
a
sentence
other
than
death
and
that
instruction
is
specifically
pointed
out
in
your
appendix,
pages
23
through
28.
furthermore,
the
juror
is--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct,
and--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct.
and
that...
that
is
how
it
complies
with
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer.
mr.
phill
kline
well,
the
guided
discretion
of
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
state
must
be
able
to...
and
a
juror...
differentiate
between
a
defendant
who
is
convicted
of
the
same
crime
as
to
the...
and
sentenced
to
life
as
the
defendant
who
is
sentenced
to
the
same
crime
and
sentenced
to
death.
and
that
is
laid
out,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
in
the
definition
of
capital
murder
and
the
requirement
of
aggravated
factors.
mr.
phill
kline
that
is
correct.
mr.
phill
kline
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
phill
kline
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
dealing
with
a
hypothetical
that
we
believe
does
not
exist
in
jury
deliberations.
a
juror
steps
back
and
decides
whether
they
can
live
with
the
decision
that
is
before
them
and
then
decides
whether
the
death
penalty
is
warranted.
and
in
fact,
kansas
law
leads
them
to
that
reasoned
moral
decision.
in
kansas
law,
in
instruction
number
4,
which
again
is
laid
out
in
your
appendix,
instructs
the
juror
that
mercy,
in
and
of
itself,
is
sufficient
to
determine
a
sentence
other
than
death.
mr.
phill
kline
that
is
correct.
mr.
phill
kline
except...
you're
correct,
justice
kennedy,
except
that
the
burden
on
the
state
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
demonstrate
that,
the
highest
burden
allowed
by
law.
and
beyond
that
burden
that
was
in
the
arizona
statute,
which
was
functionally
identical
to
the
kansas
law,
that
was
presented
in
this...
to
this
court
in
walton
v.
arizona,
and
this
court
rejected
that
very
argument
in
that
case.
as
you
may
recall,
the
arizona
law
was
that
there
was
a
responsibility
for
the
defendant
to
demonstrate
that
mitigating
factors
were
sufficiently
substantial
to
call
for
leniency.
the
arizona
supreme
court
had
decided
that
that
meant
that
the
mitigating
factors
must
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors.
and
this
court
accepted
that
case
because
of
a
conflict
between
the
ninth
circuit
which
held,
as
the
kansas
supreme
court
did,
in
adamson
v.
ricketts,
that
that
was
an
unconstitutional
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
this
court
resolved
that
conflict,
and
in
fact,
states
relied
on
that
resolution,
as
did
the
kansas
legislature,
in
articulating
the
very
standard
except
kansas
goes
further
and
keeps
the
burden
on
the
state.
mr.
phill
kline
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
phill
kline
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
phill
kline
correct.
justice
blackmun's
dissent.
mr.
phill
kline
not
at
any
stage
of
the
proceeding.
the
burden
remains
on
the
state
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
phill
kline
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
defendant,
justice
kennedy,
to
bring
forth
factors
in
mitigation.
the
standard,
though,
in
introduction
is
relevancy,
and
kansas
has
met
the...
the
requirements
of
this
court,
as
it
relates
to
the
specific
sentencing
or
individualized
sentencing
structure,
by
allowing
the
juror
to
consider
all
evidence
relevant
to
the
determination
of
a
sentence
other
than
death.
mr.
phill
kline
no,
justice
stevens.
actually
the
state's
position
is
consistent
with
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
in
this
fashion.
mr.
phill
kline
no,
because
there
is
a
requirement
upon
the
state
in
the
sentencing
phase
to
prove
factors
in
aggravation
with
jury
unanimity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
set
aside
this
particular
act
in
a
different
framework
than
those
who
commit
capital
murder
and
are
convicted
of
capital
murder.
if
the
state
does
not
meet
that
burden--
mr.
phill
kline
--this
court
has
held
that
it
does.
and
kansas
has
a
very
narrow
death
penalty
in
the
definition
of
capital
murder
and
also
the
specified
aggravators
that
the
state
must
prove.
mr.
phill
kline
just
as
it
is
in
walton
v.
arizona.
mr.
phill
kline
yes.
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
phill
kline
it
is
not
fully
consistent,
i
don't
believe.
it
is
consistent
with
the
walton
case
in
that
this
court
said
a
mandatory
death
penalty
is
not
unconstitutional,
as
long
as
the
state
differentiates
between
those
convicted
of
the
same
crime
and
who
are
sentenced
to
life
and
those
who
are
convicted
of
the
same
crime
and
sentenced
to
death.
kansas
clearly
does
that
in
the
requirement
that
the
state
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
one
of
at
least
eight
specific
statutory
aggravating
factors
exist
in
the
case.
but
kansas
goes
further.
unlike
in
walton
v.
arizona,
the
burden
remains
on
the
state
to
also
prove
that
the
mitigating
evidence
proffered
by
the
defendant
who
has
the
lowest
threshold
allowed
by
law,
and
all
that
is
required
by
this
court...
that
is
relevancy...
that
all
of
that
evidence
does
not
outweigh--
mr.
phill
kline
--well,
the--
mr.
phill
kline
--justice
stevens,
you
are
correct.
the
majority
didn't
specifically
address
that,
but
they
also
analyzed
the
case,
much
as
justice
kennedy
just
did,
in
saying
that
really
what
we're
talking
about
is
whether
the
state
eventually
at
some
point,
once
it
has
met
the
requirement
of
the
individualized
sentencing
requirements
of
this
court,
can
say
that
death
is
appropriate.
and
the
answer
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
has
been
clearly
yes
once
we
are
able
to
set
aside
this
defendant
from
other
defendants
convicted
of
the
same
crime.
mr.
phill
kline
arguably,
yes,
justice
stevens.
and
that
is
the
language
of
the
arizona
statute,
but
it
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
interpretation
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
as
well
as
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
adamson
v.
ricketts
which,
subsequent
to
the
walton
decision,
held
that
walton
controlled
and
allowed
the
potentiality
of
equipoise
to
be
constitutional.
now,
one
thing
i
would
like
to--
mr.
phill
kline
--no,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
not
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
for
this
decision.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
kansas
supreme
court
relies
on
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
eighth
amendment
for
the
interpretation
of
the
cruel
or
unusual
punishment
clause
of
the
kansas
constitution.
mr.
phill
kline
yes,
but
it
is
not
adequate
and
independent.
the
argument
of
the
respondent
is
that
the
constitutional
savings
doctrine
and
severability
arguments
are
independent
and
adequate,
and
by
their
very
nature,
they
are
dependent
rather
than
independent.
the
kansas
supreme
court
engaged
in
a...
and
i
quote
from
the
decision...
a
full
reexamination
of
the
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
in
paragraph
25
of
the
syllabus,
which
is
the
law
of
the
case
in
kansas
under
kansas
law,
that
the
kansas
death
penalty
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
that
was
the
first
such
holding
in
kansas
jurisprudence
history
finding
that
determination.
previously,
3
years
earlier,
the
court
had
found
the
death
penalty
statute
constitutional
as
construed,
and
as
this
court
knows,
you
will
not
accept
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court's
interpretation
or
construction
of
a
state
law.
so,
therefore,
this
is
the
first
opportunity
that
the
state
has
had
and
i
would
say
the
last.
mr.
phill
kline
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
phill
kline
that
would
be
incorrect,
justice
o'connor.
kansas
is
prohibited.
the
prosecutors
are
prohibited
and
limited
of
the
right
of
appeal
in
kansas
law
as
in
most
states.
and...
and
this
court
had
a
similar
case
in
neville
v.
south
dakota
in
which
you
construed
south
dakota
law
as
it
relates
to
limiting
the
prosecution's
ability
to
appeal
and,
through
that
construction,
identified
in
an
interlocutory
basis,
when
the
lower
court
passes
on
a
constitutional
measure
that
has
import
for
this
court,
that
the
inability
of
the
state
to
be
able
to
pursue
that
case
renders
jurisdiction
under
28,
section
1257.
so--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
there
is
no
death
penalty.
the
highest
court
of
our
state
has
spoken
and
stricken
it
down
as
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
mr.
phill
kline
justice
ginsburg,
there's
significant
discussion
in
the
legislature,
but
that
discussion
is
somewhat
mixed,
as
you
might
imagine,
and
some
were
concerned
that
action
might
moot
this
case.
right
now
there
are
12
pending
capital
murder
cases
in
kansas
which,
if
this
court
does
not
reverse
the
kansas
supreme
court,
the
state
will
not
be
able
to
seek
capital
murder
charges
and
the
death
sentence
in
those
cases.
mr.
phill
kline
it
is
our
position,
justice
stevens,
since
their
crimes
were
committed
prior
to
any
act
of
the
legislature,
we
would
be
prohibited
from
seeking
the
death
penalty.
mr.
phill
kline
that
is...
that
is
our...
our
position.
it
would
have
to
take
an
entire--
mr.
phill
kline
--well,
justice
stevens,
if
you
put
me
in
that
position,
i
will
be
an
advocate
for
the
state.
however,
it
is
our
position,
as
justice
ginsburg
alluded
to,
that
the
state
has
no
death
penalty
and
it
would
take
a
complete
reenactment
of
the
death
penalty
for
the
state
to
have
one.
and
that
is
borne
out
in
case
law.
there
is
no
uncertainty
as
it
relates
to
the
ability
of
the
state
to
seek
appeal
in
charging
death
once
there
is
no
death
statute
that
is
available.
the
references
in
kansas
law
to
ksa
section
22-3602(b)
are
a
very
settled
area
of
the
law.
the
respondent
argues
that
subsection
(1)
of
that
statute
would
allow
us
an
opportunity
to
preserve
this
issue
below.
however,
that
only
relates
to
the
state
being
able
to
appeal
charging
documents,
and
the
definitions
of
those
documents
are
very
specific
in
kansas
law.
furthermore,
subsection
(3)
states
that
a
prosecutor
can
reserve
an
issue,
but
case
law
is
very
clear,
and
that
is
only
if
the
kansas
supreme
court
sees
that
issue
as
important
for
the
administration
of
justice,
the
uniform
administration
of
justice,
in
the
state,
and
has
interpreted
that
to
mean
only
where
guidance
of
the
supreme
court
is
necessary.
it
is
not
a
method
for
moving
for
rehearing.
the
kansas
supreme
court
rejects
that.
we
moved
for
reconsideration
and
reconsideration
was
not
granted.
if
this
court
embarks,
as
the
respondent
asks
it
to,
it
will
put
in
jeopardy
12
capital
murder
cases
and
prevent
12
capital
murder
cases
from
being
pursued
in
kansas.
it
will
effectively
strike
down
the
laws
of
seven
other
states
that
have
functionally
identical
statutes
as
kansas.
and
furthermore,
it
would
effectively
call
into
question
the
laws
of
five
other
states
that
do
not
even
require
any
weighing
mechanism
whatsoever.
this
court
has
never
gone
further
and
required
a
specific
mechanism
of
weighing
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
and
has
relegated
that
duty,
as
it
should,
to
the
states
as
long
as
the
juror
has
the
opportunity
to
make
the
reasoned
moral
decision
based
on
the
consideration
of
all
mitigating
evidence
relevant
to
a
decision
other
than
death
that
relates
to
the
character,
the
background
of
the
defendant,
or
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
and
if
you
would
look
in
your
joint
appendix
on
pages
25
and
26,
you
will
see
the
instructions
that
the
state
of
kansas
gave
in
this
case,
and
it
is
undisputed
that
the
respondent's
presentation
of
mitigating
evidence
was
presented
to
the
jury
in
full,
and
additionally,
the
jury
was
specifically
instructed
to
consider
and
give
weight...
i'm
sorry.
it's
pages
24
and
25...
specifically
instructed
to
give
weight
to
all
of
that
evidence.
pages
24
and
25.
i
am
referring
to
instruction
number
4.
and
you
will
see
the
delineation
beginning
on
page
25
of
all
the
mitigating
evidence
that
was
admitted
as
relevant
in
this
case.
and
i
would
also
say
that
kansas
continues
to
bear
a
greater
burden
in
its
consideration...
for
the
juror's
consideration
in
that
the
juror
is
instructed
on
paragraph
2
of
instruction
4
that
mercy
in
and
of
itself
is
sufficient...
is
sufficient...
to
outweigh
the
aggravating
evidence
presented
by
the
state.
so
contrary
to
the--
mr.
phill
kline
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it
is...
it
is
a
default
for
a
life
sentence.
and
i
believe
it
is
certainly
an
acknowledgement
that
what
really
happens
here
is
a
juror
steps
back,
after
the
consideration
of
all
the
evidence
that
this
court
requires
under
the
eighth
amendment,
and
decides
what
they
can
live
with,
a
sentence
of
death
or
a
sentence
of
life.
and
one
juror
who
has
doubt
can
extend
mercy.
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
phill
kline
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
state
is
here
on
a
final
court
decision
wrongfully...
the
state
supreme
court
wrongfully
interpreting
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence.
and
just
as
justice
souter
and
the
chief
justice's
hypotheticals,
as
it
relates
to
this
case,
were
articulated,
it
is
actually
true
that
in
this
case
the
state
was
not
aware
that
this
issue
would
be
raised
again
and
only
conceded...
and
waiver
is
truly
not
an
issue
because
a
lower
court
did
not
rely
upon
it.
and
we
have
some
confusion
between
the
terms
here.
it
only
conceded
that
kleypas,
a
decision
by
the
kansas
supreme
court,
was
the
law
of
the
case
in
another
case
subsequently
reaching
the
kansas
supreme
court.
and
the
kansas
supreme
court,
on
its
own
motion,
engaged
in
a
full
reconsideration
and
the
respondent
in
their
brief
argues
that
the
primary
reliance
of
the
court
was
not
on
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
but
other
grounds.
there
is
no
requirement
for
jurisdiction
under
28-1257
that
the
primary
reliance
be
on
a
federal
issue.
there
is
a
requirement
to
deny
jurisdiction
that
there
be
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
on
which
the
decision
would
rest
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
federal
issue.
clearly
that's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
phill
kline
this
case
come
out...
no,
it
would
not
because
the
kleypas
court
found
that
the
kansas...
or
the
kansas
death
penalty
was
constitutional
as
construed.
and
the
kansas
court
in
this
case
found
it
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
and
there
is
a
significant
difference,
and
the
court
raised
the
issue
again.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
five
ways
that
a
juror
can,
after
their
reasoned
moral
decision,
give
effect
to
the
belief
that
the
mitigating
evidence
does
not
warrant
the
death
penalty.
the
juror
can
state
that
they
have
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
the
state
has
met
its
burden
of
proving
that
the
mitigating
factors
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors.
the
juror
can
simply
delay.
kansas
law
has
a
default
for
life
in
its
sentence
or
in
its
structure,
and
i
would
encourage
you
to
read
on
page
28
of
your
appendix
instruction
number
12
in
which
the
jury
is
told
that
if,
after
a
reasonable
time,
you
are
unable
to
make
a
decision...
in
other
words,
in
a
doubtful
case...
the
judge
is
required
by
law
to
dismiss
the
jury
and
sentence
the
defendant
to
life.
and
so
there
is
a
default
for
life,
and
that
is
another
way
that
a
juror
can
give
effect
to
their
reasoned
moral
decision
that
death
is
not
appropriate.
the
juror
can
give
effect
to
their
reasoned
moral
decision
that
is
not
appropriate
by
determining
that
the
mitigating
factors
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors.
and
the
juror
under
instruction
number
5--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
phill
kline
it
is,
but
the
juror
does
know
what
the
effect
of
that
decision
is
and,
therefore,
is
able
to
engage
in
a
reasoned
moral
choice.
what
truly
happens...
and...
and
justice
breyer
alluded
to
it,
i
believe,
as
it
relates
to
this
hypothetical
about
weighing
molecules...
is
that
a
juror
essentially
steps
back
and
decides
what
is
the
appropriate
sentence--
mr.
phill
kline
--i
think
the
moral--
mr.
phill
kline
--i
think
the
moral
decision,
justice
breyer,
is
determined
in
all
the
variables
of
the
introduction
of
the
evidence,
and
as
this
court
has
required
under
the
eighth
amendment,
that
it
allow
the
jury
to
consider
and
give
effect
to
all
mitigating
evidence
relevant.
and
that's
in
kansas
law.
i
would
state
this
in
closing,
and
that
is
that
the
kansas
legislature
reenacted
the
death
penalty
for
the
first
time
since
this
court
struck
it
down
in
furman
in
the
spring
of
1994.
and
in
doing
so,
it
gave
great
deference
to
this
court's
role
as
final
arbiter
of
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
and
if
you
read
the
instructions
and
the
law
that
is
provided
to
you
in
this
case,
you
will
see
this
court's
words
mirrored
back
to
you
in
the
scheme
of
the
kansas
law
as
it
relates
to
the
death
penalty.
thank
you.
mr.
phill
kline
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
specific
method
of
weighing
aggravating
and
mitigating
evidence
is
required,
yet
in
its
individualized
sentencing
line
of
cases
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
all
the
eighth
amendment
requires
is
that
a
juror
consider
and
give
effect
to
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
in
pages
23
through
28
of
your
appendix,
you
will
find
that
kansas
jury
instructions
and
kansas
law
clearly,
on
four
occasions,
instruct
individual
jurors
that
they
must
individually
consider
all
mitigating
evidence
that
they
find.
furthermore,
the
jurors
are
instructed
in
five
different
methods
in
which
they
can
give
that
mitigating
evidence
the
effect
of
a
life
sentence,
and
only
one
manner
in
which,
acting
unanimously
and
after
the
state
has
met
the
highest
burden
allowed
by
law
in
three
separate
measurements,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
demonstrated
that
the
death
sentence
is
appropriate.
specifically,
instruction
number
4,
paragraph
2
on
page
24
of
the
joint
appendix,
will
show
the
jurors
are
instructed
that
mercy,
in
and
of
itself,
is
a
mitigating
piece
of
evidence,
and
later,
in
the
instruction
that
lays
out
the
mitigating
evidence
presented
in
this
specific
case,
they
are
told,
in
paragraph
18
on
page
26
of
your
joint
appendix,
that
mercy,
by
itself,
can
be
sufficient
to
warrant
a
sentence
other
than
death.
mr.
phill
kline
justice
scalia,
you
will
find
it...
first
of
all,
mercy
is
referred
to
in
paragraph...
in
instruction
number
4--
mr.
phill
kline
--paragraph
2...
okay.
mr.
phill
kline
the
instruction,
again,
is
number
4
in
paragraph
18
on
page--
mr.
phill
kline
--26.
mr.
phill
kline
you
will
see
the
instruction
for
mercy
again.
mr.
phill
kline
justice--
mr.
phill
kline
--kennedy--
mr.
phill
kline
--certainly.
first
of
all,
the
state
has
to
prove,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
with
jury
unanimity,
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
capital
murder.
and
kansas
has
one
of
the
most
narrow
death
penalty
statutes
in
the
nation.
and
then,
past
that
time,
we
then
engage
in
a
sentencing--
mr.
phill
kline
--phase
5.
mr.
phill
kline
capital
murder
includes,
in
this
case,
that
the
homicide
involved
more
than
one
person
in
a
single
act.
mr.
phill
kline
then
we
go
to
the
sentencing
phase,
in
which
the
state
has
to
prove
one
of
eight
statutorily
defined
aggravating
factors
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
with
jury
unanimity.
there
were
three
specific
aggravating
factors
that
were
found
by
the
jury
in
this
instance.
and
then,
the
defendant
introduces
all
mitigating
evidence,
and
the
standard
of
introduction
is
relevancy.
but,
unlike
the
walton
case,
which
has
a
functionally
identical
provision
that
is
at
issue
here,
the
state
maintains
the
burden,
while,
in
walton,
the
burden
was
provided
to
the
defendant
to
demonstrate
that
the
mitigating
factors
were
so
substantial
to
call
for
leniency.
mr.
phill
kline
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
found
in
instruction
number
10.
and
as
we
go
through
this
process,
you
see
that
the
kansas
death
penalty
law
has
a
default
to
life
in
virtually
every
stage
of
the
prosecution
of
the
case.
and
then,
instruction
number
10
is
a
determination
by
the
legislature
consistent
with
this
court's
precedent,
because
we
have
narrowed
the
class
of
defendants
who
are
eligible
for
death,
consistent
with
furman
and
the
concern
for
guided
discretion.
and
then,
we
have
allowed
the
introduction
and
consideration
of
all
mitigating
evidence.
the
juror
is
then
told
how
to
give
the
effect
that
they
desire,
after
the
reasoned
moral
decision,
to
that
mitigating
evidence.
as
defense
counsel
for
mr.
marsh,
in
the
transcript
of
the
sentencing
phase,
on
page
66,
volume
4...
it
is
not
in
your
joint
appendix,
but
it
is
part
of
the
record
before
the
court...
stated
to
the
jury
in
closing,
"the
practical
fact
is
that
each
of
you
will
decide
whether
or
not
you
believe
death
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
"
"and
if
you
decide
that
death
is
not
the
appropriate
sentence,
you
have
decided
that
the
mitigators
outweigh
the
aggravators.
"
what
instruction
number
10,
which
is
before
you
today,
which
states
that
the
state
must
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
mitigators
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors,
is,
is
guidance
to
the
jury
on
how
they
can
give
the--
mr.
phill
kline
--effect--
mr.
phill
kline
--if
a
juror
finds...
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens...
if
the
juror's
decided
conclusion
and
reasoned
moral
judgment
is
that
the
mitigating
factors
and
the
aggravating
factors
are
in
balance,
and
finds
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
instruction
number
10
clearly
indicates
that
death
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
so,
it--
mr.
phill
kline
--justice
souter,
of
course
the
state
believes
that
it
is.
it
is,
first
of
all,
consistent
with
this
court's
precedent
as
what
is
required--
mr.
phill
kline
--and
in
the...
in
the
walton
case,
this
court
found
that
a
functionally
identical
provision
in
arizona,
even
though
the
burden
remained
on
the
defendant,
was
appropriate
after
the
state
had
met
the
requirements
of
guided
discretion,
as
well
as
the
individualized
sentencing
requirement,
in
setting
about
a...
proving
that,
"this
defendant
is
more
deserving
of
death
than
anybody
else
convicted
of
the
same
crime.
"
mr.
phill
kline
the
state
maintains,
justice
souter,
that
the
decision
that
the
mitigating
factors
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors
is
a
decision,
and
it
is
a--
mr.
phill
kline
--the
distinction,
justice
souter,
that
i
believe,
from
your
analogy,
is
that
the
kansas
legislature
has
said
they
do
know,
and
that
death
is
appropriate
once
a
defendant
has
been
found
guilty
of
capital
murder,
in
a
very
narrow
definition.
and
then,
once
the--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
phill
kline
i
would
agree,
justice
scalia--
mr.
phill
kline
--justice
roberts,
i
believe
that
there
are
a
couple
of
things
which
might
help
illuminate
a
little
bit
more
what
the
jury
faces
in
this
instance.
first
of
all,
the
statement--
mr.
phill
kline
--there
is
a
verdict
form
that
requires
the
jury,
with
unanimity,
if
the
sentence
is
death,
to
indicate
that
the
state
has
met
the
burden
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
demonstrating--
mr.
phill
kline
--correct.
mr.
phill
kline
the
jury
does
not
find
in
that
fashion.
mr.
phill
kline
how--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
the
issue,
just--
mr.
phill
kline
--as
it
was
in
walton,
which
had--
mr.
phill
kline
--a
functionally
identical
provision
that
required
that
the
defendant
demonstrate
that
there
were
mitigating
factors
substantial
enough
to
call
for
leniency,
which--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct,
justice
roberts.
and,
in
fact,
they
are
informed
that
it
is
not
a
numerical
equation.
mr.
phill
kline
justice
ginsburg,
unlike
in
arizona,
there
is
a
specific
instruction
to
the
jury
that
they
must
decide
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
mitigating
factors
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors
before
the
death
sentence
is
imposed.
and
it
is
analogous
to
instructing
the
jury
on
how
to
give
the
effect
they
desire
to
the
mitigating
and
aggravating
factors
that
have
been
presented.
i
would
possibly
agree
that
we
would
have
a
constitutional
issue
if
it
was
similar
to
instructing
a
jury,
"you
either
mark
blue
or
red
on
the
jury
verdict
form,
and
we
will
not
tell
you
the
effect
of
that
decision.
"
however,
this
instruction
clearly
lets
them
know
that
a
decision
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
state
has
met
its
burden,
that
the
mitigators
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors,
that
the
effect
is
death.
and--
mr.
phill
kline
--justice
alito,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
what
occurs,
because,
indecision,
under
kansas
law,
is
clearly
indicative
of
a
life
sentence.
in
fact,
if
the
jury
does
not,
with
unanimity,
come
together
and
make
an
affirmative
decision,
and
indicate
such
on
the
verdict
form
within
a
reasonable
time,
they
are
told
and
instructed,
"the
judge
shall
dismiss
the
jury.
"
and
the
state's--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct,
at
some
point.
i
wouldn't
term
it
a
"default
rule"
in
every
statutory
scheme
involving
the
death
penalty.
there
is
a
point
in
time
when
the
jury
is
informed
that
the
result
of
their
deliberations
is
a
death
sentence.
so,
you
can
call
something
a
default
rule
in
virtually
any
state.
and,
in
fact,
relying
on
the
walton
decision,
many
states
have
functionally
identical
statutes
to
kansas,
and
courts
have
interpreted
the
walton
decision
as
resolving
this
issue.
in
adamson
v.
lewis,
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
issue
of
the
potential,
the
hypothetical,
of
equipoise
was
resolved
in
walton.
furthermore,
the
idaho...
the
seventh
circuit,
relating
to
the
idaho
scheme
relating
to
the
death
penalty,
found
that
this
court
resolved
the
issue
in
walton,
as
did
the
illinois
court.
so,
there
have
been
several
findings
based
on
walton.
and,
in
fact,
the
kansas
legislature
enacted
this
death
penalty
statute
soon
after
walton--
mr.
phill
kline
--justice
stevens,
as
you're
aware,
that's
the
blackmun
dissent
in
walton,
in
the
hypothetical
that
he
posed
with
his
concern
about
walton.
i
believe
that
there
could
come
a
point
in
time,
based
on
the
instruction,
that
the
jury
was
not
able
to
give
full
effect
to
the
mitigating
evidence
that
they
desired.
mr.
phill
kline
that's...
that
there...
it
would
approach
a
time,
possibly,
where--
mr.
phill
kline
--this
court
would
find--
mr.
phill
kline
--this
court,
under--
mr.
phill
kline
--on
my
view?
it
would
approach
a
problem
with
this
court's--
mr.
phill
kline
--i'd
defer
to
the
wisdom
of
this
court.
[laughter]
mr.
phill
kline
my
answer
would
be
that
the
law
clearly
provides
that
if
that
is
the
finding--
mr.
phill
kline
--the
moral
reason
would
be--
mr.
phill
kline
--justice
breyer,
i
would
say
that
the
moral
reason
is,
"i
know
the
effect
of
that
deliberation,
and
i
know
that,
if
i
make
that
finding,
that
the
death
sentence
will
be
warranted.
"
mr.
phill
kline
and--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
the
concern
about
unfettered
moral
judgment
of
a
jury
calls
into
question
the
original
purpose
for
furman.
and
so,
there
is
guided
discretion--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct.
mr.
phill
kline
that
is
correct,
justice--
mr.
phill
kline
--mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
phill
kline
and,
justice
kennedy,
that
is
the
decision
in
the
holding
in
walton.
and--
mr.
phill
kline
--the
first
determination
that
a
jury
engages
in
is
whether
the
defendant
has
been
proven,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
guilty
of
capital
murder--
mr.
phill
kline
--which
is
defined
in
a
very
narrow
statute.
kansas--
mr.
phill
kline
--then
we
have...
you're
correct.
mr.
phill
kline
and
then
we
have
a
separate
sentencing
phase
in
which
the
state
first
bears
the
burden
of
demonstrating
one...
eight...
of
eight
aggravating
factors
is
present.
and
that
burden
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
phill
kline
--with
jury
unanimity.
mr.
phill
kline
and--
mr.
phill
kline
--no,
the--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
there
are
several--
mr.
phill
kline
--justice
scalia--
mr.
phill
kline
--justice
scalia,
that
is
correct.
once
the
state
has
met
the
burden
of
proving
that
one
of
the
eight
statutory
aggravators
is
present--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
is--
mr.
phill
kline
--correct.
mr.
phill
kline
there
is
a
separate
burden
there--
mr.
phill
kline
--justice
souter.
and
as
it
relates
to
the
"give
effect"
language,
the
cases
that
this
court
has
considered
regarding
that
are
dramatically
different.
in
those
cases,
such
as
the
penry
cases
and
other
cases,
the
concern
was,
the
jury
was
affirmatively
instructed
that
they
could
not
use
evidence
that
was
introduced
and
relevant
in
a
manner
which
would
lead
to
mitigation,
such
as
the
defendant's
youthfulness.
and
the
special
instruction
in
texas
said
that
they
could
only
utilize
that
evidence
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
likelihood
of
reoffense.
and
this
court
reasoned
that
it
is
possible
to
look
at
youthfulness
as
mitigating
factor
which
diminishes
the
moral
culpability
of
the
defendant.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
jurors
were
unable
to
take
the
mitigating
evidence
and
give
it
whatever
effect
they
desired
in
mitigation.
in
fact,
they
are
instructed
that
they
must
individually
consider
all
such
evidence.
and
then
they
are
instructed
to
make
their
decision
based
upon
what
effect
that
they
would
give
it.
mr.
phill
kline
so--
mr.
phill
kline
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
i
think
the
confusion
is
the
use
of
the
term
"aggravated
murder",
which
would
be
not
quite
correct
under
kansas
law.
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
of
a
finding
of
guilt
of
capital
murder,
and
that
is
in
very
narrow
circumstances.
kansas
has
one
of
the
most
narrow
death
penalties
in
the
nation.
then
once
that
guilt
is
determined,
we
then
move
to
the
phase
where
the
state
must
prove
an
aggravating
factor
in
addition
to
having
proved
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
capital
murder.
mr.
phill
kline
once
that
is
achieved,
then
the
jurors
are
instructed
to
give
way
to
a
consideration
to
all
aggravating
factors
that
they
find,
with
unanimity,
to
exist,
and
to
consider
all
mitigating
evidence
which
they
find,
individually,
to
exist,
with
the
only
burden
on
the
defendant
being
relevancy
for
introduction.
and
then,
they
are
instructed
to
consider
whether
the
state
has
proven,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
mitigating
factors
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors.
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
phill
kline
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
referring
to
justice
scalia's
question
as
it
relates
to
other
states
that
are
affected,
in
the
joint
appendix,
pages
98
through
107,
you
have
a
summary,
and,
additionally,
in
the
amici
brief
that
was
filed
by
several
states,
on
page
23,
it
identifies
arizona,
florida,
nevada,
north
carolina,
oklahoma,
and
missouri
as
having
similar
provisions.
and,
additionally,
the
cases
that
have
relied
on
walton
to
determine
that
the
equipoise
issue
has
been
resolved
are
the
eleventh
circuit,
in
jones
v.
dugger,
the
arizona
supreme
court.
and
in
state
v.
gretzler,
they
found
that
the
provision
provided
for
equipoise,
as
well
as
in
idaho,
in
state
v.
hoffman.
as
it
relates
to
a
juror
somehow
imposing
death
when
they
are
undecided,
i
would
direct
you
to
page
26
of
the
joint
appendix,
at
instruction
number
9,
which
reads,
"the
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
individual
opinion
of
each
juror.
"
"each
of
you
must
consider
the
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
reaching
a
verdict.
"
"each
of
you
must
decide
the
case
for
yourself.
"
furthermore,
the
jury
is
instructed,
in
instruction
number
12
in
the
second
paragraph
on
page
28
of
the
joint
appendix,
that,
"in
order
to
reach
a
verdict
in
the
case,
your
decision
must
be
unanimous.
"
"and
then,
after
reasonable
deliberation,
if
you
are
unable
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict,
you
shall
notify
the
court,
and
the
result
is
a
life
sentence.
"
kansas
law
is
very
clear
that
death
is
only
appropriate
in
the
singular
instance
in
which
a
jury
has
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
with
unanimity
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
capital
murder,
that
an
aggravating
factor
exists,
and
then
that
the
mitigating
factors
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors.
it
was
in
1994
that
the
kansas
legislature
passed
the
death
penalty
in
kansas,
a
few
years
after
the
walton
decision.
and
i
was
there
for
the
debate,
as
a
legislator.
it
was
a
compelling
moment,
not
just
because
of
the
result,
but
the
solemnity
and
seriousness
of
the
debate
in
which
they
were
seeking
to
define,
through
their
reasoned
moral
judgment,
what
justice
demands
in
instances
such
as
this.
and
recognizing
this
court
as
the
final
arbiter
of
the
meaning
of
the
eighth
amendment,
you
will
see,
through
pages
23
through
28
of
your
appendix,
your
words
mirrored
back
to
you.
the
legislature
has
respected
your
judgment
and
made
the
reasoned
moral
decision
that
death
is
appropriate
in
the
instances--
mr.
phill
kline
--that
we
are
discussing.
mr.
phill
kline
in
the
debate,
all
of
these
decisions
were
discussed
through
committee
as
well
as
on
the
legislative
floor.
and
the
belief
was,
in
these
various
aggravated
and
narrow
circumstances,
that
the
state
believes
death
is
appropriate.
and
if
we
followed
the
individualized
sentencing
line
of
these
cases
and
allowed
a
jury
to
consider
all
of
the
mitigating
evidence
that
is
relevant,
that
the
state
could
make
that
decision.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
