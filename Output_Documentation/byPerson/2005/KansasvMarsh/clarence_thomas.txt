justice
clarence
thomas
the
first
opinion
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
04-1170,
kansas
versus
marsh.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
a
kansas
jury
convicted
michael
lee
marsh
of
capital
murder
and
sentenced
him
to
death
under
the
kansas
death-penalty
statute.
that
statute
provides
that
if
a
unanimous
jury
finds
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
one
or
more
aggravating
circumstances,
and
that
those
circumstances
are
not
outweighed
by
any
mitigating
circumstances,
the
death
penalty
shall
be
imposed.
the
kansas
supreme
court
held
that
the
state’s
death-penalty
statute
violated
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution,
because,
quote,
“in
the
event
of
equipoise,
that
is,
the
jury’s
determination
that
the
balance
of
any
aggravating
circumstances
and
any
mitigating
circumstances
weighed
equal,
the
death
penalty
would
be
required”.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
kansas
supreme
court.
this
court’s
decision
in
walton
versus
arizona
controls
the
outcome
of
this
case.
in
walton,
the
court
held
that
a
state
death-penalty
statute
may
place
on
the
defendant
the
burden
to
prove
that
mitigating
circumstances
outweigh
aggravating
circumstances,
and
that
a
sentence
less
than
death
is
therefore
warranted.
thus,
kansas
may
direct
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
when
the
state
has
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
mitigating
evidence
does
not
outweigh
aggravating
evidence,
including
where
the
two
are
balanced.
even
if
walton
does
not
control
the
outcome
here,
general
principles
of
our
death-penalty
jurisprudence
lead
to
the
same
conclusion.
consistent
with
this
court’s
decision
in
furman
versus
georgia
and
gregg
versus
georgia
and
their
progeny,
kansas’
death-penalty
statute
rationally
narrows
the
class
of
death-eligible
defendants
and
permits
the
jury
to
render
a
reasonable,
individualized
sentencing
determination
by
allowing
a
capital
defendant
to
present
any
relevant
mitigating
evidence
and
obliging
a
kansas
jury
to
consider
that
evidence
in
determining
an
appropriate
sentence.
as
this
court
explained
in
franklin
versus
lynaugh,
we
have
never
held
that
the
constitution
requires
a
specific
method
for
balancing
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors.
rather,
as
we
pointedly
observed
in
blystone
versus
pennsylvania,
the
states
enjoy
a
constitutionally
permissible
range
of
discretion
in
imposing
the
death
penalty.
providing
the
type
of
guided
discretion
we
have
sanctioned
in
walton
and
blystone,
kansas’
weighing
equation
merely
channels
the
jury’s
discretion
by
providing
criteria
by
which
the
jury
may
determine
whether
life
or
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence.
kansas’
jury
instructions
clearly
inform
the
jury
that
a
determination
that
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise
is
a
decision
for,
not
a
presumption
in
favor
of,
the
death
penalty.
so
informed,
a
jury’s
conclusion
that
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
are
in
equipoise
is
a
decision
for
death
and
is
indicative
of
the
type
of
measured
process
in
which
a
jury
is
constitutionally
tasked
to
engage
when
deciding
the
appropriate
sentence
for
a
capital
defendant.
justice
scalia
