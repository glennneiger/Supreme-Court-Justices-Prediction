justice
david
h.
souter
general,
may...
may
i...
i'd
like
to
pose
a
question
which
at
least
gets
to
the
nub
of
the
issue,
as
i
see
it,
and...
and
get
your
response
to
it.
the
premise
of
my
question
is
this.
we...
we
generally
regard
mitigation
evidence
as
favoring
life,
aggravation
evidence
as
favoring
death.
we've
got
a
case
in
which
the...
the
assumption
is
that
they
are
evenly
balanced.
the...
the
pans
of
the
scale
are
exactly
even
on
that.
kansas
says
in
that
case
the
jury
shall
return
the
verdict
of
death.
if
we
are
going
to
demand,
as
we
have
said
that
we're
going
to
demand,
that
the
determination...
that
the
death
penalty
determination
would
be
one
of
what
we
have
called
reasoned
moral
judgment,
then
what
has
to
be
supplied
in
order
to
make
the
kansas
provision
consistent
with
reasoned
moral
justice,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
death.
other
things
being
equal,
there
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
death.
and
my
question
is,
am
i
correct
in
saying
that
in
order
to
hold
your
way,
we
have
to
hold
that
the
eighth
amendment...
it
is
consistent
with
the
eighth
amendment
to
presume
the
appropriateness
of
death,
other
things
being
equal?
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
agree
that's...
that's
a
proper
way
to
look
at
the
issue
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
how
do
you
get
off
the
dime?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the...
the
direction,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
if
mitigation
and
aggravation
are
even,
then
the
only
way
to
come
to
a
conclusion
is
to
say,
as
the
statute
does,
because
the
mitigation
does
not
outweigh
the
aggravation,
you
should
return
a
verdict
of
death.
and
that
seems
to
me
another
way
of
saying
there
is
a
presumption
that
if
aggravation
and
mitigation
are
equal,
that
the
penalty
should
be
death.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
the
attorney
general
said
that
the...
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
case
the
issue
was
focused
on,
in
effect,
sort
of
remedy,
severance,
and
so
on,
was
dependent
upon
the
assumption
about
what
federal
law
required.
it
was
dependent
upon
the
earlier
case
which
so
held.
so
i
don't...
and...
and
what
he
seem...
says
seems
plausible
to
me.
i...
i
don't
see
how
we
can
divorce
the
judgment
here
with
the
earlier
judgment,
which
kansas...
which
the
kansas
supreme
court
relied
upon
here,
which
was
a
federal
ground.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
wouldn't
have
even
raised
the
issue
had
it
not
been
for
the
earlier
federal
holding.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you...
do
you...
i...
i
take
it
this
is
the
implication
of
your
position.
do
you
take
this
position
that
in
any
instance
in
which
a
state
supreme
court
decides
a
case
on
a
federal...
decides
an
issue
on
a
federal
ground
in
case
a,
and
for
whatever
reason,
case
a
is
not
brought
to
this
court
for
review,
that
in
every
subsequent
case
in
the
state
system,
which
depends
upon
state
a,
the
state
is
totally
without
the...
or
this
court
is...
is
totally
without
jurisdiction
to
review
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you're...
if
you're
right,
i
take
it,
we
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to
review
a
federal
ground
that
was
raised
by
a
state
court,
even
though
it
had
not
been
raised
by
the
parties.
if
they
get...
you
know,
they
get
the
opinion
from
the
court
and
there's
a
big
surprise...
the...
the
state
court
decided
to
go
off
on...
on
a
federal
ground,
which
had
not
been
pressed...
i
take
it
on
your
view
we
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to
review
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
difficulty
i
have
is
in
the
phrase
that
you
have
mentioned
in
the
course
of
your
argument
a
couple
of
times
referring
to
the
"reasoned
moral
response".
and
the
difficulty
i
have
in
squaring
"reasoned
moral
response"
with
the
construction
that
the
kansas
court
and
we
all
agree
is
the
proper
construction
of
the...
of
the...
of
the
equipoise
kind
of
provision,
is
this.
kansas
has
a
right,
as
i
understand
it,
to
define
what
it
regards
as
the
aggravating
circumstances,
those
that
support
a
death
verdict.
and
kansas
has
done
so.
kansas
is
also
saying
that
if
a
jury
cannot
find
that
the
aggravators,
as
we've
defined
them,
outweigh
the
mitigators...
i.e.,
if
the
jury
is
in
equipoise...
the
result
must
be
death,
anyway.
and
that
does
not
seem
to
be
a
reasoned
moral
response.
i'm
assuming
that
a
reasoned
moral
response
would
be,
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed
because
the
aggravators
do
outweigh...
i.e.,
it's
not
equipoise...
the
aggravators
are
heavier.
and
because
kansas
is
saying,
"even
though
they're
not,
death
is
the
result,
anyway.
"
it
doesn't
seem
like
a
reasoned
moral
response.
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
the
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
here
we
have,
it
seems
to
me,
to
be
a
stark
finding
that
it
has
not
been
proven.
that
is
what
"equipoise"
means.
if
aggravators
are
the
basis
for
a
death
sentence,
the
equipoise
finding
is,
"aggravators
don't
predominate.
"
"we
cannot
make
that
conclusion.
"
"we're
right
on
the
fence.
"
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
call
that
a
reasoned
moral
response...
"we're
on
the
fence,
but
execute
anyway.
"
--seems
a
total
inconsistency.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
a
decision
that
says,
"we
don't
know
what
should
be
done.
"
if
aggravators
define
the
basis
for
execution,
and
mitigators
define
the
basis
for
life,
the
equipoise
verdict
says,
in
so
many
words,
"we
don't
know
which
is
more
important.
"
and
kansas
says,
when
the
jury
comes
back
and
says,
"we
don't
know",
that
the
result
should
be
death.
and
that
is
what
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
the
notion
of
a
reasoned
moral
response.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is
not
our
case,
is
it?
because
our
case
is
not,
"we
don't
find
that
the
mitigators
outweigh.
"
our
case
is,
"we
find
the
mitigators
are
of
equal
weight.
"
that's
why
you
get
to
equipoise.
it's
not
a
question
of
the
failure
of
mitigators
to
predominate.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is
the
sufficiency
of
mitigators
to
equal
in
weight.
and
that's
what
poses
the
problem,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course
it
is
not
to
predominate,
but
it
is
something
more
precise
than
merely
not
predominating.
it
is
a
fact,
in
effect,
that
you
don't
know,
if
all
you
know
is
that
they
don't
predominate.
the
fact
that
you
know,
here,
is
that
they
equal,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
right.
we
don't...
we
don't
know
whether
that
was
the
case
here
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
our
question
is,
if
a
jury
could
return
the
death
verdict
in
the
equipoise
situation,
as
the
kansas
supreme
court
has
defined
it,
is
that...
is
that
statute
allowing
for
that
possibility
constitutional?
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
law
in
kansas?
i
mean,
i
thought...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
because
i
may
have
made
a
wrong
assumption
here...
i
thought
the
finding
of
guilt
to
an
aggravated
murder
is
the
preface
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
aggravators
or
mitigators
predominate.
and,
based
upon
that
determination,
there
will
be
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
sentence
should
be
death
or
life.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and,
at
that
point,
we
don't
have
any
way
of
knowing,
i
take
it,
whether
the
penalty
should
be
life
or
death.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
i'm...
what
i'm...
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
i
don't...
i...
as
i
understand
the
kansas
scheme,
the
determination
of
guilt,
to
aggravated
murder,
does
not
create
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
but
the
fact
of...
let
me...
i
think
we've
got
a
terminological
problem...
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
finding
of
guilt
of
aggravated
murder
is
not
tantamount,
as
i
understand
it,
to
a
finding
that
aggravating
factors
to
be
considered
at
the
penalty
phase
have
also
been
found.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
regardless
of
the
likelihood
of
that
situation
in
any
given
case...
and
i
happen
to
agree
with
justice
scalia;
i
mean,
i
don't
think
the
likelihood
of
that
in
a
given
case
is
great...
we're,
nonetheless,
i
think,
faced
with
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
says,
"that
can
happen".
justice
david
h.
souter
"and
if
it
does
happen,
the
result
is
death.
"
and
i
think
we've--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we've
got
to
take
that
as
a
given.
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
see
any
way
out
of
it?
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
i...
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
i...
your
point,
i
take
it,
is,
the
jurors
are
going
to
make
this
decision,
not
the
legislature
of
kansas.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
justice
kennedy
is
saying,
when
they
make
that
determination,
"we
can't
tell
whether
one
outweighs
the
other.
"
that
they
are
making
a
moral
judgment
there.
and
what's
your...
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
he's
saying
they
are
making
a
moral
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they
know
what
its
consequence
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--saying
moral--
justice
david
h.
souter
--judgment
has
got
to
be
an
either/or
judgment,
not
a
"we
can't
figure
it
out"
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
