ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
to
devote
the
bulk
of
my
time
to
answering
the
state's
arguments
on
the
merits
because
the
constitutional
issue
presented
by
the
kansas
capital
sentencing
statute
is
actually
quite
different
than
the
state
and
its
amici
would
have
it
appear.
their
arguments
rest
on
an
erroneous
assumption
about
the
way
the
statute
operates
and
the
real
issues
that
its
operation
raises.
under
the
kansas
formula,
prosecutors
can
and
do
urge
jurors
not
to
persevere
in
their
decision
making
if
they
are
undecided
regarding
the
balance
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
in
other
words,
if
the
decision
is
too
hard
to
make,
the
sentence
must
be
death.
the
formula--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it's
not
right
to
think
of
this
in
terms
of
mathematical
formulas,
molecules
on
one
side
or
the
other.
this
is
a
subjective,
qualitative
determination
that
the
jury
makes,
and
whatever
capital
sentencing
statute
a
state
chooses,
states
are
free
to
choose
whatever
structure
they
see
fit
to
determine
whether
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence.
however,
states
are
not
free
to
enact
a
statute
that
doesn't
ensure
a
reliable
determination
that
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence,
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
it's
a
qualitative
judgment
and
one
can
imagine,
very
easily
i
think,
a
scenario
where
jurors
are
deliberating.
they
take
their
jobs
very
seriously
and
they
cannot
make
a
determination
whether
aggravators
outweigh
mitigators,
or
vice
versa.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
in...
in
a
situation
of
equipoise,
by
which
i
mean
a
state
of
indecision
on
whether
the
relative
balance
between
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
burden
of
proof
is
not
the
sticking
point
there.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
but
that...
that's...
that's
the
problem
because
that's
not
a
reliable
determination.
it's
no
determination
that
based
upon
the
individual--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--but
the
jury
is
specifically
instructed
under
this
formula
that
they
have
a
third
option,
and
that
is
where
they
can't
make
a
decision,
whether
aggravators
outweigh
mitigators,
or
vice
versa--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--but
the
jury
is
required
to
impose
death
at
that
point,
and
it
is
a
decision
that
aggravators
are
not
outweighed
by
mitigators.
but
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
requires--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--the
eighth
amendment
requires
jurors
to
make
a
determination,
based
upon
individual
characteristics,
whether
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence,
whether
the
defendant
deserves
death.
and
when
the
jury
is
in
a
situation
of
equipoise
and
is
required
to
impose
death,
they're
imposing
death
without
having
made
that
determination
that
death
is
an
appropriate--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--well,
there's
no--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--the
statute
does
tell
them
what
to
do.
it
tells--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--well,
but
if...
if
you
think...
if
you
look
at
the
prosecutorial
arguments,
for
example,
that
have
been
made
in
both
the
kleypas
and
marsh
cases,
those
prosecutorial
arguments
have
urged
the
jurors
to
do
exactly
what
i
described,
and
that
is
to
abdicate
their
decision
to
make
a...
a
determination
based
on
the...
on
the
individual
characteristics
on
the
question
of
whether
death
is
an
appropriate
punishment
for
this
individual
offender
based
on
the
specific
circumstances
of
this
crime,
and
that
if
they're
in
equipoise,
they
have
to
impose
a
death
sentence.
that
is
encouraging
the
jurors
to
abdicate
their
decision
to
determine
whether
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence
or
not.
then--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--well--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--well--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--but
that's
one
factor
among
many
that
the
jury
has
to
consider.
and
the
problem
here
is
that
the
jury
could
have
all
of
the
information
that
a
defendant
has
proffered
as
a
basis
for
a
sentence
less
than
death,
and
a
jury
could
still
be
unable
to
decide
whether
aggravation
or
mitigation
is
the
weightier
in
a
closely
balanced
case.
and
that
is
the
problem
here.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
only
if
they
persevere
in
that
decision
making,
and
prosecutors
urge
them
not
to
by
telling
them
that
they
must
impose
death
when
they
cannot
decide
the
balance
between
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
no,
i
did...
we
did
not
include
the
prosecutorial
closing
arguments.
they
are
in--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--they
are
in
the
brief.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
yes.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
that's
correct.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
that's
correct,
and
then
in
mr.
marsh's
case,
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case...
and
i've
cited
to
the
record
for
that
argument,
which
is
at...
i
apologize.
it's
at
volume
54
at
pages
54
and
55
of
the
record
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
in
the
marsh
case.
and
in
that
case,
the
prosecutorial
arguments
told
the
jury
that
they
can't
even
consider
mitigating
evidence
unless
they
find
that
mitigating
circumstances
outweigh
aggravating
circumstances
because
the
law
has
told
you
and
the
judge
has
told
you
that
the
law
says
that
if
the
aggravating
circumstances
are
not
outweighed
by
mitigating
circumstances,
you
shall
return
a
verdict
of
death.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
no.
this
is
not
a
question
of
not
being
able
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances.
and
as
i
said--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--yes.
that's
part
of
the
jury
instructions
in
capital
cases.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
but
when
you
think
about
the
difficulty
of
the
individualized
sentencing
decision
that
the
jury
has
to
make,
the...
one
juror
might
feel
that
way,
but
it's
only
if
they
persevere
in
that
decision
making.
this
statutory
equipoise
provision
encourages
jurors
not
to
persevere
in
their
decision
making.
they're...
they're
sitting
around
in
the
jury
room.
one
juror--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--it
says
that
if
the
jury
finds
the
existence
of
at
least
one
aggravating
factor
and
determines
further
that
any
aggravating
circumstances
that
exist
are
not
outweighed
by
any
mitigating
circumstances
found
to
exist,
the
sentence
shall
be
death.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
the
statutory
equipoise
provision,
as
the
kansas
supreme
court
found...
they
construed
this
statute.
they
construed
it
to
mean
that
it
requires
death
when
jurors
are
undecided
about
the
balance
between
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
that
construction
of
the
statute
is
entitled
to
respect.
and
under--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--the
kansas
supreme
court
in
the
kleypas
case
in
holding
it
unconstitutional.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
no.
under
the
statute,
the
state's
burden
of
proof,
which
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt...
i'll
grant
that,
but
it's
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
aggravators
are
not
outweighed
by
the
mitigators.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
the
defendant.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
the
kansas
supreme
court
construed
it
to
mean
that
a
tie
goes
to
the...
to
the
state.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
but
this
is
not
about
structuring
decision
making.
this
is
about
terminating
decision
making
on
the
issue
that
is
central
to
the
eighth
amendment
requirements
at
the
selection
stage--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--well,
the
statute
hasn't
assigned
a
burden
of
proof,
but
still
that's
not
the
problem
here.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
because
what
the
individualization
requirement
means,
in
this
court's
own
jurisprudence,
is
that
mere
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances
is
not
enough.
the
court
said
so
in
tennard
and
in
many
other
cases,
penry
v.
johnson,
that
it's
not
enough
that
the
sentencer
be
allowed
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances.
it
must
be
allowed
to
consider
and
give
effect
to
those
mitigating
circumstances.
and
when
a
jury
cannot
decide
between
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
when
that
jury
is,
nevertheless,
required
under
this...
that
situation
to
impose
a
sentence
of
death,
the
sentence
of
death
has
been
imposed
without
the
jury
having
made
the
requisite
individualized
sentencing
decision
under
the
eighth
amendment
at
the
selection
stage.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
that's
right.
and
the
kansas
supreme
court
found
that
that
was
a
real
possibility.
and
the
kansas
supreme
court
found
this
statute
unconstitutional
in
kleypas
because
it
violates
the
individualized
sentencing
requirement,
and
the
court
specifically
found
that
it
requires
death
when
jurors
are
unable
to
decide
the
balance
between
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
that's
how
the
statute
was
construed
in
kleypas.
i
would
like
to
address
the
jurisdictional
issue
for
a
few
moments,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
from
the
court
on
the
equipoise
issue,
which
i'd
be
happy
to
answer.
but
one
of
the
things
i
want
to
discuss
today
is
the
jurisdictional
issue
on
the
adequate
and
independent
state
law
ground,
which
this
court
asked
the
parties
to
brief.
i
feel
that
the
state
misstates
the
issue
there
as
well
because
in
the
kansas
supreme
court,
the
state
conceded
the
federal
unconstitutionality
of
the
kansas
equipoise
formula,
as
decided
by
the
court
in
the
kleypas
case
4
years
ago,
and
defended
in
this
case
only
on
the
contested
state
law
ground
of
severability
and
bypassed
raising
a
federal
question
in
a
motion
for
a
rehearing,
which
again
relied
solely
on
state
law
severability
grounds.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
it's
clear
that
the
kansas
supreme
court's
decision
relies
on
severability
as
a
basis
for
its
decision,
and
it's
true
that
the
kansas
supreme
court,
in
doing
so,
reiterated
the
kleypas
holding.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
that's
right,
but
mr.
marsh
raised
the
issue
on
state
law
severability
grounds.
the
state
conceded
that
mr.
marsh
was
entitled
to
have
his
death
sentence
vacated
because
of
the
unconstitutional
equipoise
provision.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
where
the
issue
has
not
been
pressed
by
a
party
in
the
state
court,
no,
i
don't--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--well,
we
asked
the
court
to
overrule
the
severability
decision
in
kleypas.
there
was
absolutely
nothing
preventing
the
state
from
arguing
that
the
constitutional
decision
in
kleypas
should
be
overruled.
absolutely
nothing
preventing
that.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
i
think
that
they--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--well,
but
futility
is
never
a
reason
for
not
raising
an
issue.
criminal
defendants
are
required
to
raise
issues
all
the
time
in
order
to
preserve
them
for
later
review.
in
engle
v.
isaacs,
this...
this
court
said
futility
is
no
excuse.
and
what
is
good
for
criminal
defendants,
very
respectfully,
is
good
for
the
state.
and
justice
rehnquist
said
as
much
for
the
court
in
the
court's
decision
in
illinois
v.
gates,
that...
that
states
are
not
exempt
from
the
ordinary
rules
of
procedure
which
govern
this
court's
jurisdiction.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
state
not
only
did
not
raise
the
federal
issue
in
the
kansas
supreme
court
below,
which
it
could
have,
but
it
conceded
the
federal
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
there's
a...
there's
a
relationship
between
the
adequate
and
independent
state
law
cases
and
the
not
pressed
or
passed
upon
cases
because,
for
example,
in
michigan
v.
long,
this
court
has
said
where
an
issue
is
pressed...
a
federal
issue
is
pressed
in
the
state
courts,
then
this
court
on
review
will
resolve
any
ambiguity
in
the
court's
opinion
in
favor
of
a
presumption
that
the
issue
was
passed
upon
by
the
state
court.
but
conversely,
in
coleman
v.
thompson,
this
court
held
that
where
an
issue
is
not
pressed
in
the
state
courts,
then
the
presumption
will
be
the
opposite.
the
presumption
will
be
that
the
state
court
has
not
passed
upon--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--but
the
kansas
supreme
court
didn't
redecide
that
issue
in
the
marsh
case.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
there...
well,
under
article
iii
and
under
section
1257(a),
there
has
to
be
a
case
or
controversy
for
this
court
to
review.
there
was
no
live
case
or
controversy
in
the
kansas
supreme
court
on
the
federal
question
of
whether
the
equipoise
provision
in
the
kansas
statute
was
constitutional.
it
was
conceded
that
it
was
unconstitutional
and
the
parties
agreed
on
that.
it
was
treated
as
settled.
and
all
the
kansas
supreme
court
did,
before
overruling
the
kleypas
severability
decision,
which
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
was
to
reiterate
that
holding,
and
mere
reiteration,
as
this
court
knows
from
the
morrison
v.
watson
case,
approved
in
illinois
v.
gates,
that
is
not
the
decision
of
a
federal
question.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
i
don't
believe
the
court
would,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court's
original
jurisdictional
rules
were
intended
to
be.
now,
i
do
understand
that
the
court
has
taken
jurisdiction
over
such
issues,
and
it's
usually--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--well,
the
only
issue
that
i
could
find
that
says
that...
that
really
enforces
that
rule
is
the
cohen
v.
cowles
media
case.
and
if
you
look
at
the
provenance
of
that
decision,
that's
the
only
case
where
the
court
actually
considered
a
question
for
the
first
time
in...
in
this
court.
and
what
happened
in
that
case
is
that
the
federal
issue
that
was
presented
to
this
court
was
actually
discussed
at
oral
argument.
it
wasn't
raised
by
either
of
the
parties
in
their
briefs
in
the
state
court,
but
it
was
discussed
at
oral
argument.
and
the
court
decided
a
first
amendment
issue
on
the
basis
of
that
discussion
at
oral
argument.
and
so
this
court
took
jurisdiction
and
stated
that
as
long
as
it's
been
passed
upon,
it's
not
necessary
that
it
was
pressed
upon.
and
the
decision,
which
the
court
relied
on
in
that
case,
if
i'm
remembering
it
correctly,
was
a
decision
involving
a
federal
question
which
was
raised
too
late
to
comply
with
the
procedural
requirements
in
state
court.
and
so
it's
really
not
the
case
that
this
court
routinely
takes
cases
where
the
issue
was
not
pressed
by
the
parties
in
the
state
courts.
and
that's
the
situation
we
have
in
this
case.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
i
think
where
the
issue
is
decided
sua
sponte
and
affects
the
parties
in
that
case,
then
maybe.
but
that
didn't
happen
here.
what
happened
here
was
that
the
court
merely
reiterated
a
holding
from
4
years
ago,
and
the
state
law
severability
decision,
which
was
the
issue
in
contest
in
this
case
and
the
issue
that
was
decided
in
this
case,
was
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
it
was
sufficient
to
support
the
judgment
of
the
kansas
supreme
court.
and
really,
what...
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
here
is
to...
i
mean,
these
issues
were
decided
in
the
kleypas
case,
and
if
we
were
here
on
the
kleypas
case,
there
wouldn't
be
any
argument
as
to
whether
the
kansas
supreme
court's
decision
rested
on
an
adequate
and
independent
state
law
ground
because
the
federal
issue
was
clearly
decided
and
it
was
interwoven
with
the
state
law
determination.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
yes,
they
did.
but
the
state
is
misconstruing
their
decision
by
saying
they
didn't
decide
the
constitutional
question
in
kleypas.
it
was
merely
construction
of
the
statute
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
and
therefore--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--the...
that
language
in
the
court's
opinion
was,
after
full
reconsideration,
we're
declining

we're
declining
that
invitation
to
revisit
the
issue.
and
there's
no
question
that
the
court
discussed
it
and
thought
about
it,
and
the
dissenters
were
clearly
inviting
them--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--but
they
didn't
reopen
the
issue.
they
said
there's
nothing
new
here.
we
don't
need
to

this
decision,
and--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--they're
taking
a--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--well,
no,
because
the...
what
they
were
saying
was
that
the
appropriate
remedy
in
kleypas
was
to
return
the
subject
to
the
legislature
because
the
statute
was
ambiguous
and
the
court
had
no
authority,
under
separation
of
powers
grounds
and
under
state
law
statutory
interpretation
grounds,
to
construe
this
statute
to
mean
the
opposite
of
what
it
said.
and
that's
the
decision
that
they
overruled
in
this
case,
and
that's
a
state
law
decision.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
or
challenge
that
decision
in
this
case.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
but
if
they
wanted
to
raise
the
issue,
they
could
have
raised
it
in
either
case,
and
we
wouldn't
have
this
problem
here.
but
they
didn't
raise
it,
and
that
presents
a
jurisdictional
problem
for
this
court.
what
they're
trying
to
do
in
this
case
is
yoke
a
live
horse
to
a
dead
one
to
form
a
plowing
team,
and
it
doesn't
work.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
i
looked...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
looked
at
our
kansas
state
seal
because
it
has
a
plowing...
a
horse
drawn
plow
on
it,
and
i
looked
at
it
again
this
morning
before
i
came
in
here
because
i
couldn't
remember
whether
it
was
one
horse
or
two,
and
it's
two
horses.
and
i
was
thinking
about
how
the
meaning
of
that
state
seal
would
be
fundamentally
altered
if
one
of
those
horses
was
dead.
[laughter]
thank
you.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
since
the
argument
of
the
attorney
general
was
addressed
exclusively
to
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
kansas
statute,
i
will
devote
all
of
my
argument
to
that
subject,
as
well,
although
i
am
sure
that
the
court,
in
deliberations,
will
be
considering
the
several
jurisdictional
issues
which
were
briefed
and
argued
earlier
in
the
term.
and
if
there
are
no
questions
on
those
jurisdictional
issues,
i
will
proceed
to
the
merits.
to
pick
up
on
some
of
the
things
that
were
said
during
attorney
general
kline's
argument,
the
eighth
amendment
requires
reliability
in
the
determination
that
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence.
and
at
the
selection
stage,
the
question
is
whether
the
jury
has
made
a
reliable,
collective,
responsible
decision
based
upon
the
unique
circumstances
of
the
individual
defendant
that
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence
and
that
this
defendant
is
particularly
culpable
in
a
way
that
distinguishes
him
from
the
mass
of
death
eligible
defendants.
and
the
problem
with
the
equipoise
provision
here,
which
the
state
agrees
can
occur
under
the
kansas
statute,
is
that
we
don't
know
from
a
death
verdict
pronounced
by
a
jury
in
kansas
whether
the
jury
did
decree
death
by
equipoise
or
not.
death
sentences
must
be
rationally
reviewable.
and
when
we
look
at
the...
at
a
death
sentence
that's
been
pronounced
in
kansas,
we
can't
determine
whether
the
jury
decreed
death
by
equipoise.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
yes.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
yes,
and
i
agree--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--yes.
the
jury
did
find
an
aggravating
factor
beyond--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--a
reasonable--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--doubt.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
that's
right.
but
the
kansas
supreme
court,
in
the
kleypas
case,
examined
the
kansas
statute...
which,
by
the
way,
is
unique
to
kansas;
no
other
state
in
the
country
has
a
statute
like
this,
and
this
will
affect
no
state
outside
of
kansas...
they
examined
this
statute
in
great
detail,
and
they--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--whether
it's
unique?
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
i
don't
see
how,
because--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--kansas--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--as
we
argue
in
our
brief,
walton
simply
did
not
speak
to
this--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--issue.
and,
in
fact,
the
arizona
supreme
court,
in
walton,
interpreted
the
arizona
statute
to
require
that
aggravators
outweigh
mitigators.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
sure.
and
the
montana
statute,
which
reads
precisely
the
way
arizona's
is,
they've
decided
the
equipoise
issue
and
said
that
the
language
of
that
statute
does
not
mandate
death
by
equipoise.
so,
those
statutes
are
distinguishable,
and
there's
simply
no
other
state
that
has
a
statute
which
mandates
death
by
equipoise.
in
any
event,
the
kansas
supreme
court
did
interpret
the
statute
to
contain
a
mandatory
death
by
equipoise
provision,
which
the
state's
question
presented
assumes
is
the
case.
and
the
court,
familiar
with
the
way
the
statute
has
operated,
and
is
likely
to
operate
it
in
kansas,
found
that
equipoise
can
happen,
and
that
it
risks
unreliability
in
capital
sentencing
in
a
way
that's
forbidden
by
the
eighth
amendment.
and
i
think
one
of
the
problems
here
is
that
the
terminology
of
"weighing"
conveys
a
false
impression
of
predefined
weights.
and
the
attorney
general
conceded
that
that's
not
how
juries
consider
the
balancing
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
and
we
agree
with
that.
and
that's
why
it
is
wrong
to
view
this
as
principally
a
burden
of
proof
issue.
it's
not.
the
issue,
at
the
selection
stage...
the
state
certainly
has
the
burden
to
prove
an
aggravating
circumstance
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but,
at
the
selection
stage,
the
issue
is
not
meeting
some
particular
burden
of
proof,
it's
whether
the
jury
has
made
a
reliable,
responsible,
collective
decision
that
this
unique
defendant
deserves
the
death
penalty
that
distinguishes
him--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--from
other
death
eligible--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--defendants.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
let's
look
at
the
way
that
equipoise
can
happen
under
the
kansas
statute...
and
i
think
justice
alito
alluded
to
it...
that
if
the
jurors
can't
decide
between
aggravated
and
mitigating
circumstances,
the
sentence
is
death.
the
statute
decrees
death,
and--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--they've
decided--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--what
they've
decided
is
that,
in
looking
at
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
together,
they
can't
determine,
one
way
or
the
other,
whether
aggravators
outweigh
mitigators
or
mitigators--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--outweigh
aggravators.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
yes.
i
think
it
can
occur
in
close
cases.
and,
after
all,
those
are
the
only
cases
where
equipoise
would
even
be
relevant.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example.
suppose
there's
a
woman
who
wants
to
donate
a
million
dollars
to
yale
law
school,
and,
as
part
of
that
donation,
she's
going
to...
she
has--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--well,
bear
with
me
for
a
minute,
your
honor.
she
has
to
choose
a
portrait
of
her
beloved
husband
to
hang
in
the
law
school.
these
portraits
were
taken
at
different
times,
they
have
different
qualities,
different
features.
and
she
has
to
choose
one.
and
this
decision
proves
extraordinarily
difficult
for
her
to
make.
and
she
compares
the
relative
qualities
of
the
two
portraits.
they're
both
good.
she
loved
her
husband.
and
she
simply
cannot
choose
between
the
two.
and
so,
she
does
one
of
two
things.
one
is
that
she
just
can't
bear
to
debate
with
herself
anymore
about
which
one
is
the
better
quality
portrait;
and
so,
she
becomes
agnostic
about
it
and
says,
"i
give
up.
"
"pick
one.
"
and
so,
she
picks
one.
the
other
is
that
the
decision
is
simply
too
difficult
for
her
to
make;
and
so,
she
abdicates
that
decision
and
says,
"let
the
dean
pick".
and
you
can
analogize
that
to
the
ways
in
which
this
statute
can
operate.
and
the
jury
can
arrive
at
equipoise
by
becoming
agnostic
about
the
decision
on
whether...
on
the
balance
between
aggravating/mitigating--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--circumstances.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
you
see,
individual
jurors,
in
the
course
of
deliberations...
this
is
a
qualitative
judgment,
after
all,
and
individual
jurors,
in
the
course
of
deliberations,
might
be
leaning
one
way
or
the
other
at
different
times
during
deliberations.
but
what
this
equipoise
provision
does
is
that
it
allows
the
jurors
to
compromise
on
equipoise
when
they
simply
cannot
deliberate
anymore,
or
if
they
simply
just
want
to
avoid
making
the
hard
decision.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
yes.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
the
jury
does
have
to
find
equipoise
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
jury
is
making
that
decision
of
equipoise,
which
requires
the
death
sentence,
without
having
made
the
individualized
sentencing
determination
required
at
the
selection
stage
under
the
eighth
amendment.
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
equipoise
provision,
because
it
allows
the
jury
to
avoid
making
that
decision,
which
is--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--required.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
i
think
if
the
statute
requires
that
the
aggravators
outweigh
mitigators,
this
court
has
upheld
that
formula.
that
is
a
decision
that
the
jury
has
made.
and
the
legislature
can
make
that
decision.
and
so,
when
you
look...
that's
why
i'm
trying
to...
i
mean,
the
state
agrees
that
this
is
not
a
quantitative
determination.
and
i
will
grant
you,
if
the
jury
is...
if
it
were
a
quantitative
determination,
which
is
totally
unrealistic,
and
we
agree
with
the
state's
reasoning
on
that...
then
if
the
jury
is
precisely
exactly
equivalent,
50-50,
on
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
that
might
be
said
to
constitute
a
decision.
but,
as
even
the
state
argues,
that's
not
how
jury
deliberations
work.
and
under
this
equipoise
provision,
the
jury
can
decree
death
without
having
made
the
individualized
sentencing
decision
required
at
the
selection
stage.
and
it's
because,
on
the
one
hand,
if
the
decision
is
too
close
to
call,
the
equipoise
provision
allows
the
jurors
to
simply
give
up
and
settle
on
equipoise
as
a
group.
this
is
a
group
decision,
after
all.
they
have
to
be
unanimous
on
the
question
of
whether
aggravators--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--are
not--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--outweighed
by
mitigators.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
absolutely
not,
because
they're
not
making
the
decision
that's
required
at
the
selection
stage.
and
to
follow
up
on
something
that
general
kline
said
during
his
argument,
that
the
provision
is
for
a
hung
jury,
there's
no
provision
for
a
hung
jury
in
the
event
the
jury
finds
itself
in
equipoise.
the
only
provision
for
a
hung
jury,
under
the
kansas
statute,
is
if
the
jury
is
unable
to
reach
a
verdict.
but
equipoise,
does
not
prevent
a
death
verdict.
in
fact,
the
statute
requires
a
death
verdict
if
the
jurors
are
in
equipoise.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
a
determination
of
equipoise...
the
jury
has
to
find
equipoise
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
that,
necessarily,
means
that
the
aggravators
are
not
outweighed
my
mitigators.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
that's
how
this
statute
was
interpreted
by
the
kansas
supreme
court.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
the
jury
certainly
knows
that
they
are
imposing
a
death
sentence.
but
what
this
instruction
and
the
prosecutorial
arguments
given
in
the
cases
tell
them
is
that
they
can
fulfill
their
responsibilities
as
jurors
without
coming
to
a
final
judgment
about
whether
aggravators
outweigh
mitigators,
or
vice
versa.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
but
in--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--but
the
fact
that
this
is
a
group
decision
leads
to
even
a
greater
risk
of
abdication
of--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--that
decision.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
but
it's
a
group
decision,
and
jurors
are
encouraged
and
forced
to
compromise
to
come
to
a
verdict.
and
in
close
cases,
with
jurors
leaning
slightly
one
way
or
another,
they,
being
forced
to
come
to
a
consensus,
are
even
more
likely
to
compromise
on
equipoise,
rather
than
engage
in
the
draining
task
of
persuading
each
person
leaning
one
way
or
the
other
to
come
together.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
absolutely.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
that's
right.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
that's
right.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
that's
right.
this
court
is
bound
by
the
kansas
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
what's
happening
here
is,
when
the
jurors
do
settle
on
equipoise,
in
whatever
way
they
settle
on
equipoise,
the
fact
of
the
matter
that...
is
that
in
either
of...
either
of
the
two
cases
i've...
well,
either
in...
in
three
cases
i've
described,
the
jurors
are
following
their
instructions,
and,
in
either
of
these
situations,
the
defendant
is
being
sentenced
to
death
only
as
a
death
eligible
defendant,
because
that's
the
only
constitutionally
required
decision
that's
actually
been
made
by
the
jury
in
that
situation.
and
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
about
the
box
from
the
last
argument,
the
legislature
has
determined
that
the
individuals
will
be
separated
out
as
a
result
of
equipoise,
but
there
is
nothing
about
that
situation,
them
being
in
that
box,
that
separates
them
from
any
other
generic
death
eligible
defendant.
and
that's
the
problem
with
this
equipoise
provision.
and,
yes,
the
kansas
supreme
court
found
that
it
can
happen.
this
court
is
bound
by
that
interpretation.
the
state
concedes
that.
and,
therefore--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--the--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--yes.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
yes.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
yes,
and
i
think--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--the
legislature
is
going
to
take
that
up
again.
and
there's
simply
no
consequence
to
anyone
else
by
affirming
the
kansas
supreme
court's
decision
in
this
case.
the
legislature
is
going
to
take
the
matter
up
again.
there's
no
question
about
that.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
speculate
on
that.
there
are
going
to
be
arguments
on
both
sides,
certainly.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
but
there
is
no
moral
judgment,
as
has
been
stated
here.
there's
no
moral
judgment.
the
state
can...
the
legislature
can
determine
that
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence.
the
legislature...
this
court
upheld
a
legislative
determination,
when
aggravators
outweigh
mitigators,
in
blystone,
that--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--but
you
cannot
divorce
the
weighing
process
enacted
by
the
legislature
from
the
individualized
sentencing
decision
required
under
the
eighth
amendment
at
the
selection
stage.
and
the
equipoise--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--provision.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
that's
right.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
and
if
the
legislature--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--but
the--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--this
statute
allows
a
third
option
of
equipoise,
which
allows
a
jury
to
impose
death
without
making
that
judgment.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
the
kansas
supreme
court's--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--but
the--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--the
other
possibilities
are
that
the
jury

ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--that
is
not
a
moral
judgment,
because
it
says
nothing
about
the
personal
culpability--
ms.
rebecca

woodman
--of
the--

rebecca

ms.

absolutely.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
i
mean,
the
kansas
supreme
court
determined
that
equipoise
can
happen.
and
in
the
situations
that
i've
described,
there
is
a
real
risk
under
this
statute
that
the
jury
can
either
become
agnostic
and
just
pick,
and
the
statute
requires
them
to
pick
death,
or
the
jury,
encouraged
by
prosecutorial
arguments
to
abdicate
the
decision,
do
abdicate,
simply
cop
out
and
impose
death,
because
it
allows
them
to
avoid
making
the
tough
choice.
and
i
think
those
are
very
real
possibilities
under
this
statute.
the
statute
requires
death
in
those
situations,
and
it's
the
risk
that
this
procedure
poses
that
presents
the
problem.
and
this
court
has
always
held
that
these
kinds
of
risks
of
unconstitutional
results
are
intolerable
in
capital
cases.
and
we
simply
cannot
look
at
a
death
sentence
in
kansas
and
say,
with
any
reliability
at
all,
that
this
jury
did
not
decree
death
by
equipoise,
that
this
jury
made
the
reliable
sentencing
judgment
required
under
the
eighth
amendment
at
the
selection
stage.
we
just
can't
say
that
under
this
statute.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
well,
they're
not--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--they're
not...
they're
not
ignoring
their
instructions
at
all.
they're
following
their
instructions
if
they
arrive
at
equipoise.
and
the
instructions
and
the
prosecutorial
arguments
tell
them
to
impose
death.
the
prosecutorial--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--arguments
are--
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
--perfectly
in
line.
ms.
rebecca
e.
woodman
it's
not
that
they're
tuning
out.
they
take
their
jobs
very
seriously.
but
what
they
are
encouraged
to
believe
by
the
instructions
and
the
prosecutorial
arguments
is
that
they
will
fulfill
their
responsibilities
as
jurors
without
coming
to
a
final
judgment
on
whether
aggravators
outweigh
mitigators
or
vice
versa.
and
it's
the
risk
that
they
will
do
that,
that
makes
this
statute
unconstitutional.
and
the
kansas
supreme
court
determined
that
there
is
such
a
risk
of
equipoise
under
this
statute
that
it
cannot
comply
with
the
eighth
amendment.
thank
you.
