justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask...
ask
you
this.
as
a...
rather
than
presumptions,
can
we
look
at
this
case
as
a
matter
of
shifting
burdens
of
proof?
i...
i
take
it
the
constitution
does
not
require
the
state
to
introduce
mitigating
evidence.
that's...
that's
the
responsibility
of
the
accused.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
when
a
state
shows
that
the
mitigators
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravators,
then
it's
the
defendant's/accused's
burden
to
go
forward
and
show
that
they
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
i
take
it
the
state
has
no
duty
to
adduce
mitigating
factors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
because
the
defendant
hasn't
introduced
enough
evidence
of
mitigation
and
that's
the
duty
of
the
defendant
to
come
forward
with
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
say
it's
a
state
of
indecision.
the
jury
has
decided
that
aggravating
factors
have
been
established.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
it
a
reliable
determination
that,
number
one,
it's
a
death
qualified
accused
in...
in
any
event,
and
there
have
been
specific
aggravators
proved?
that
has
been
determined.
it's
now
for
the
defendant,
in
effect,
to
show
that
the
mitigating
circumstances
outweigh
this.
the...
and
you
have
the
bonus
that
the
state
has
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
mitigators
have
not
outweighed
the
aggravators.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
have
made
the
decision.
they
have
made
the
decision
that
the
aggravators
are
there
and
have
not
been
outweighed.
they
have
made
that
decision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
because
the
mitigation
case
hasn't
been
made.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
terminating
it
because
there's
not
enough
mitigating
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in
the
case
before
us,
the
court...
the
kansas
court
said...
i
think
it's
24
or
25
of
the...
of
the
headnote...
we
are
reconsidering
the
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
made
a
reasoned
judgment
about
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
reopened
it
to
the
extent
as
justice
scalia
has
indicated,
but
they
now
take
a
different
view
of
the
validity
of
the
state
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's...
that's
a
decision
following
a
reason,
and
the
reason
is
a
federal
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
began
by
saying
that
there's
three
different
measures,
i
think...
i
think
was
the
word
you
used.
and
the
state,
i
take
it,
must
prove,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
(a)
that
it
was
an
aggravated...
or,
(a)
that
it
was
an
aggravated
murder,
(b)
that
there
was
another
crime
involved--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--sort
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
you
could
just
walk
me
through
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--capital
murder
includes,
in
this
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--involved
more
than
one
person.
then,
second?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
had
to
prove,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
mitigating
factors
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors
that
have
already
been
established.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
moral
answer
is
also,
"he
stands
before
us
with
the
scales
already
tipped.
"
"he
stands
before
us
having
been
shown,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
to
have
committed
aggravated
murder.
"
"he
has
the
obligation
to
show
us
why
he
should
be
excused
from
that
penalty.
"
"he
has
not
done
so.
"
"we
can
take
anything
that
he
came...
brought
to
our
attention,
and
we
can
say
that
this
outweighs.
"
it
does
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
are
confident
that
the
jury
found
aggravating
factors.
we
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
know--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
they
found
them
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
know--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
we
know
that
they
found
that
the
defendant
had
not
shown
that
mitigating
factors
outweighed
those
aggravating
factors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
that
hurts
you
somewhat.
if
you
want
to
give
us
this
visual
metaphor
of
a
scale,
or
a
football
field,
where
you
move
it
beyond
the
50
yardline,
whatever
visual
metaphor
you
want,
and
you
weigh,
you
balance
where
the
scales
of
justice
balances,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
stronger
case
than
saying
the
jurors
can
establish
their
aggravation,
then
they
can
take
any
mitigating
factor
they
want,
for
any
reason,
and
apply
it.
and
they
can't
do
that,
because
the
defendant
hasn't
shown
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's...
that
that's
a
weaker
argument
than
if
you
had
this
balancing
mechanism
that
was
our
controlling
metaphor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
already
decided
aggravating...
you
can't
say
they
can't
decide
it.
they've
already
decided
aggravating
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
they're
deciding
is
that
there's
no
mitigating
circumstances
to
outweigh
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
haven't
the
jurors
made
the
decision
that,
"we
have
looked
at
all
of
the
moral
arguments
that
he
has
presented.
"
"each
of
one
of
the...
of
us
has
individually
weighed
them.
"
"each
one
of
us
know
that
if
we
have
any
moral
reason
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
we
can
do
it.
"
"and
we
make
the
moral
judgment
that
we
cannot
make
that
determination.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
moral
judgment,
from
beginning
to
end.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
that's...
your
term
is
"equipoise".
you
say
the
jury
has
done
nothing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
say
the
jury
has
done
nothing.
what
the
jury
has
done
is,
it's
weighed
all
the
evidence
with
great
care,
and
it's
said
that,
"beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
mitigating
circumstances
do
not
overcome.
"
that
is
a
moral
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
label
it
"equipoise".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
that
under
this
instruction,
a
kansas
juror
could
say,
"you
know,
i'm
not
interested
in
deliberating
more.
"
"i'm
not
going
to
participate?
"
that's
what
you're
want...
that's
what
you
want
us
to
believe,
right,
based
on
this
argument?
i...
that's
just...
any
juror...
any
jury
can
ignore
its
instructions.
there's
nothing
i
can
do
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
here,
they
are
instructed
to
consider
every
mitigating
circumstance
that's
presented
and
determine
whether
or
not
that
should
be
a
factor
in
their
decision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
you're
suggesting
that
they
kind
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
they
can
tune
out.
