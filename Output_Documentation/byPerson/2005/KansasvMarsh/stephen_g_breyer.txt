justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
can...
can
you
go
back
to
justice
souter's
question
for
a
minute?
because
the
way
i'm
thinking
about
this,
i'm
making
two
assumptions
that
i'd
like
you
to
make,
first,
that
there
could
be
such
a
case,
which
i
very
much
doubt,
but...
but
this
is
a
lawyer's
hypothetical,
this
whole
thing,
in
a
sense.
but
i'll
make
the
assumption
there
could
be
such
a
case.
second,
i
will
assume
that
our
case
law
leaves
this
open,
a
matter
that
can
be
argued.
but
suppose
that
we
do
make
that
assumption
for
the
moment.
then
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
this
made
up
case
is
the
case
of
the
following.
we
have
aggravating
factors
and
break
them
down
into
molecules
on
a
scale,
and
for
every
molecule
of
aggravation
here,
there
is
a
molecule
of
mitigation
there,
so
that
the
juror
who
is
very
conscientious
ends
up
with
the
same
number
of
molecules
of
equal
weight
on
this
scale.
and
in
our
made
up
instance,
kansas
says,
if
that's
the
situation,
you
must
say
death.
now,
if
that's
the
case,
how
would
you
reconcile
that
with
a
view
of
the
eighth
amendment
that
says
if
you're
going
to
sentence
someone
to
death,
there
has
to
be
something
special
about
his
case
that
means
it's
somewhat
worse
than
the
ordinary
case
because,
after
all,
for
every
molecule
of
specialness
that
warranted
death,
we
have
a
molecule
of
mitigation
that
doesn't?
so
that's
where
i
am,
trying
to
get
the
cases
out
of
it
and
trying
to
take
very
seriously
the
hypothetical
that
is
before
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
see,
my
hypothetical
is
designed
to
cut
free
of
the
language
of
the
cases.
i
have
no
doubt
you
can
go
through
the
language
and
show
that.
and
it's
designed
to
say,
but
the
very
point
of
those
cases
is
you
do
not
send
someone
to
death
unless
the
jury
decides
that
the
circumstances
here
make
him
somewhat
worse,
at
least
one
molecule
worth
of
worse,
than
the
typical
person.
and
given
the
evenness
of
the
balance,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
say
that,
though
i
grant
you,
when
you
go
back
to
those
words
in
the
cases,
you're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
they're...
they're
saying
it
is
appropriate.
they're
saying
it
is
appropriate.
we
have
the
people
put
in
the
box.
the
box
is
are
they
in
a
situation
that
is
different
from
the
average
murderer.
yes.
and
they're
making
the
determination
that
although
they're
in
that
box,
that
morally
they're
no
different.
morally
they're
the
same--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
for
every
factor
that
makes
them
morally
one
way,
there's
a
factor
that
makes
them
morally
the
other
way.
so
they're
different,
but
they're
not
morally
different.
now,
that's...
that's
what
i
think
this
case
presents.
and
i...
i
mean,
i
imagine
a
juror
who's
thinking
just
what
i
said.
i
don't
know
if
there
ever
was
such
a
juror,
but
if
there
was
such
a
juror,
the
statute
in
this
instant
tells
him
what
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
where
you
think
there
is
an
equivalent,
but
not
a
moral
difference,
death.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
different
from
saying
not
decided.
i
thought
the
kansas
supreme
court
didn't
speak
of
not
decided.
i
thought
it
didn't
speak
in
kleypas
about
a
jury
who...
a
juror
who
can't
make
up
its...
his
mind.
i
thought
it
said
the
jury
has
made...
it
assumed
the
juror
has
made
up
his
mind.
that's
why
i
think
it's
artificial.
it
says
where
the
jury
finds.
it
finds
equipoise
as
to
the
mitigating
and
aggravating
circumstance,
then
death,
that
the
jury
has
to
find
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true
i...
i
think,
isn't
it?
and
then
the
question
is,
does
a
state
have
a
right
not
to
do
with
burden
of
proof,
not
to
do
with
anything
else,
but
to
have
perhaps
the
artificial
situation
where
the
jury
finds
that
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise
whoever
has
the
burden
of
proof.
put
it
all
on
you,
whoever
had
it.
that
was
their
final
conclusion.
i
find
it
is
in
equipoise.
next
question,
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
agree
with
you.
that's
not
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
do
it.
make
the
reasoned
moral
choice.
and
the
facts
are
that
we
have,
because
of
the
balancing,
molecules
or
not...
we
have
by
the
balancing
made
a
determination
that
anything
for
the
bad
that
distinguishes
this
person
from
the
ordinary
is...
is
equally
balanced
by
the
good.
now,
make
the
moral
choice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
leaving
law
out,
which
i'd
like
to
do,
just
for
the
sake
of
argument,
imagine
you're
a
juror,
and
this
is
a
totally
contrived
situation,
which
i
think
we're
deciding...
i
don't
know
if
there's
ever
been
such
a
situation...
but
you're
a
juror,
and
you're
told
the
following
by
a
fellow
juror,
"the
reason
that
we
have
these
aggravating
circumstances,
which
are
hard
to
understand
here,
is,
we
want
to
be
sure
this
fellow
is,
morally
speaking,
somewhat
more
deserving
of
death,
in
the
average.
"
and
then
he
says,
"and
the
reason
that
we
have
these
mitigating
circumstances
here
is
because
everyone
of
them
means
that
he's
somewhat
less
moral...
he's
not
as
morally
undeserving,
cuts
the
other
way,
it
reduces...
it
makes
him
less
deserving
of
death,
morally
speaking.
"
now,
you're
the
juror,
how
do
you
feel
about
this?
and
you
say,
"they're
absolutely
in
balance,
absolutely
in
balance.
"
"for
every
fact
here
on
the
aggravating
side
that
puts
me
thinking,
morally
speaking,
he's
more
deserving
of
death,
there
is
a
mitigating
factor
which
makes
me
think,
morally
speaking,
he's
less
deserving
of
death.
"
"so,
i'm
in
perfect
balance.
"
and
your
fellow
juror
says,
"now,
will
you
please
give
me,
then,
one
moral
reason
why
he
should
be
executed?
"
and
what's
your
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
if
the
law
says,
"you
have
to
be
able
to
give,
morally
speaking,
reason...
you
have
to
reason
your
way
towards
the
moral
conclusion
that
he's
deserving
of
death.
"
--that's
why
i
tried
to
take
the
law
out
of
it.
i
don't
want
you
to
be
a
lawyer.
i
want
you
to
be
a
juror.
and
i
want
you
to
give
a
moral
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why,
when
this
is
in
equipoise,
he
is
more
deserving
of
death
than
the
average.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--anything--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay,
well,
what
do
you
say
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
the
difficulty,
i
think,
in
the
case
is,
it's
artificial.
i
think
it
is.
we're
in
an
artificial
situation,
and
we're
imagining
those
12
jurors
saying
they're
in
equipoise
between
mitigating
and
aggravating.
we
don't
know.
they...
even.
all
right.
now,
you
could
look
at
this
as
saying,
"you
have
to
have
a
reason
for
thinking
these
people
are...
this
person
is
morally
worse
than
the
average.
"
and
then
we
imagine
some
fungible
commodity,
like
moral
badness
units.
and
for
every
one
we
go
up
on
the
aggravating
side,
we
go
down
on
the
mitigating
side,
so
we're
back
to
zero.
and
then,
some
people,
like
you,
are
looking
at
this
and
saying,
"see,
you're
at
zero.
"
"you
went
up,
you
went
down,
so
they're
no
worse
than
the
average.
"
but
other
people
can
look
at
it
and
say,
"we'll
tell
you
about...
one
thing
about
this
individual.
"
"this
is
an
individual
who
did
do
the
aggravating
things,
and
he
has
counterbalancing
mitigating
things,
and
that's
good
enough
to
separate
him
out,
morally
speaking,
from
somebody
who
doesn't.
"
now,
my
problem
is,
you
either
look
at
it
the
one
way
or
you
look
at
the
other
way,
and
you...
and
i'm
trying
to
find
a
reasoned...
if
you...
can...
do
you
want
to
add
anything?
