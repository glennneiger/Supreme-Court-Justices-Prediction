yes.
in
arizona,
the
burden
was
placed
on
the
defendant,
was
it
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to...
to
prove
the
mitigation?
and
yet,
the
court
upheld
that
even
in
the
equipoise
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
over
a
dissent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
kansas
does
not
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
going
to
address
the
other
questions?
i
think
we've
added
a
question
about
whether
the
kansas
supreme
court's
judgment
was
adequately
supported
by
an
independent
state
ground.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
this
has
been
adequately
addressed.
do
we
have
jurisdiction
here?
the...
the
kansas
supreme
court
vacated
the
capital
murder
judgment
and
remanded
it
and
said
it
would
have
done
it
anyway
because
of
the
state
law
evidentiary
error
concerning
admission
of
third
party
guilt
evidence.
so
does
that
independent
ground
mean
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
here
on
this
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
was
another
ground.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
was
this...
was
this
case
remanded
for
a
new
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
presumably,
if
there
is
a
conviction
and
a
sentence,
you
could
come
back
here
again
by
way
of
a
cross
appeal.
