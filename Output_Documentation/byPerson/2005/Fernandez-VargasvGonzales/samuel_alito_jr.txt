aren't
there
several
possible
explanations
for
why
congress
would
leave
the
"before
or
after"
language
out
of
the...
out
of
the
new
provision?
they
might
have
wanted
it
just
to
be
decided
under
the
landgraf
framework.
isn't
that
one
possibility?
or
they
might
have
thought
that
ina,
which
would
be
1952,
and,
therefore,
irrelevant
by
the
time
this
was
passed.
