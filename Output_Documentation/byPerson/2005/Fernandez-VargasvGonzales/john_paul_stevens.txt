justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
elementary--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--an
elementary
question,
just
to
be
sure
we
all
agree
on
this?
you
do
agree,
do
you
not,
that
if,
in
1997,
congress
passed
a
statute
that
said
you
should
get
an
extra
$50
penalty
for
having
come
in,
back
in
1981,
that
would
not
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
there's
sort
of
an
irony
in
the
fact
that
the
actual
consequence
here
is
a
great
deal
more
serious.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice

which
is
constitutionally
prohibited.
but
the
consequences
here
are
permitted.
i
understand
the
analysis.
it's
like
just
saying
we
take
away
one
ground
for
staying
that
we
didn't
have
before.
but
looking
at
it
in
kind
of
a
basic
sense,
that
seems...
it's
a
fairly
serious
thing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
happens,
and
it
effects
an
awful
lot
of
people,
doesn't
it?
