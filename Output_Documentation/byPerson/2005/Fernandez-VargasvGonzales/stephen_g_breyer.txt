justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
here?
i
want
to
know,
if
your
client
had
known
about
this
law
or
gone
to
a
lawyer
and
said,
"what
do
i
do
now"?
wouldn't
the
lawyer
have
said,
or
would
he
have
said,
"just
leave.
"
"leave
the
country,
quick,
before
you're
caught.
"
"now,
when
you
get
back
to
mexico,
you
can
apply
and
point
out
you've
married
an
american
citizen,
and
then
you'll
be
able
to
come
in,
in
all
likelihood.
"
and
if
i'm
right
about
that,
the
act
does
not
attach
new
consequences
to
old
behavior,
it
attaches
new
consequences
to
new
behavior;
namely,
the
act
of
staying
within
the
united
states,
when
you
could
leave.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
when
this
particular--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--provision
was
passed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
week
later,
he
goes
to
a
lawyer,
and
the
lawyer
says,
"you'd
better
get
out
of
here
fast,
because
if
you're
caught
while
you're
here,
you're
married
now,
and
you
won't
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
that.
"
"it
would
be
terrible.
"
"so,
go
to
mexico.
"
"then
there
is
no
problem.
"
and
if,
in
fact,
i'm
right,
you
see
what
i'm...
i
find
your
argument
excellent
on
the
first
part,
but
so
is
the
government's.
so,
i
think
there's
a
kind
of
wash
there,
so
i'm
looking
to
the
second
part.
and
there,
you're
just
said,
it
attaches
new
consequences
to
old
behavior.
so,
i'm
asking
you,
if
it
doesn't
attach
the
new
consequences
to
old,
but,
necessarily,
plus
new
behavior...
namely,
remaining.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--being...
if
you
get
married...
if
you're
outside
the
country
and
you
marry
an
american,
you're
married
to
an
american
and
you
can't
come
in
for
5
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
a
result
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
initial
deporting
order.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
his
choice
is
this
act
or...
in
which
case,
you
never
can
get
back,
if
you're
caught...
or
go
to
mexico,
wait
5
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ten
to
20
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
mean,
he
either
stays
in
the
united
states--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
10
to
20
years--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
caught.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
lose
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--case...
if
you
lose
this
case,
then
his
choice
would
be,
stay
here,
get
caught,
and
you
never
can
come
back,
or
10
to
20
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
go
to
mexico,
and
you
can
come
back
in
5
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
but
i...
i
didn't
understand
this
now.
i
guess
i
don't.
forget
the
'94/'96
periods.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it
had
stayed
the
same
throughout.
would
you
say,
then,
that
someone
who
came
illegally
into
the
country,
and
he's
caught,
and
he's
married
to
an
american,
there's
no
possibility
he
can
stay,
no
matter
what,
no
matter
how
appealing?
is
that
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm...
yes,
but
you're
talking
technically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
there's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--some
other
way
you
could
stay.
what's
the
other
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
was
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
it
comes
to
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--same
thing.
so,
that...
what
i'm
thinking
is
that
a
person
who
is
here,
and
they
marry
an
american...
all
right
+/?
they
marry
a
citizen.
now,
before
this
act
was
passed,
there
was
a
way
that
if
they're
really
good...
let's
assume
they're
the
best
human
beings
around,
and
the
attorney
general
finds
all
that
out,
and
everybody
knows
this
is
like
a
saint,
and
they
say,
"okay,
you
behave
well
enough.
"
"you
can
stay.
"
now,
after
the
act
is
passed,
all
those
relevant
actions
have
taken
place
in
'86,
long
before.
now,
there's
absolutely
nothing
they
can
do.
all
they
can
do
is
go
home.
and
now
i've
learned
that
when
they
go
home,
they
will
be
told,
"you
cannot
come
back,
no
matter
what,
for
5
years.
"
now,
that's
a
pretty
harsh
consequence,
to
separate
yourself
from
your
family
or
have
your
family
come
to
a
foreign
country.
so,
if
i
think
the
first
part
of
this
is
a
wash,
you
have
a
great
argument,
they
have
a
great
argument,
and
i
look
to
the
second
part,
does
it
attach
new
consequences
to
old
and
unchangeable
behavior?
i
say,
yes,
it
sure
does.
now,
why
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
so,
then,
you're
saying
the
answer
i
got
before
was
wrong--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that,
in
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
now
have
my
client
in,
he's
come
after
iirira
has
been
enacted,
and
he
says,
"i've
heard
about
this
in
iirira,
and
what
in
heaven's
name
am
i
supposed
to
do?
"
and
the
lawyer
says,
"get
out
fast,
next
train.
"
"go
back.
"
"and
if
you
get
across
that
border,
you're
safe.
"
"because
at
that
point,
you
can
apply;
and
you're
a
saint,
and
you've
been
married,
they'll
let
you
right
in,
because
they'll
find
out.
"
that's
what
your
view
of
the
law
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
must
be
the
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
in...
and
this
is
not...
i
was
saying
the
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--would
be,
is
this
act
attaching
consequences
to
old
things
that
you
couldn't
do
anything
about?
and
you're
saying,
"not
entirely.
"
"you
can.
"
"you
can
leave.
"
"in
which
case,
you'll
be
no
worse
off,
except
for
the
train
fare.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
a
person
who
just
leaves
voluntarily,
having
reentered
illegally,
cannot
come
back
for
5
years,
no
matter
what,
under
1156(a)(6)(b).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
repealed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
