--well,
let

go

i
take

your

to
the
question
i
asked

is
that

has
committed
a

offense,

later
voluntarily
returns
to...
in

that

would
not,
in
any
sense,
be
canceled
out.

that

it.

this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
10th
circuit.
for
years
now,
immigration
law
has
provided
that
an
order
for
removing
an
unlawfully
present
alien
may
be
reinstated
if
the
alien
leaves
and
unlawfully
enters
again.
the
illegal
immigration
reform
and
immigration
responsibility
act
of
1996,
which
everybody
calls
iirira,
enlarged
the
class
of
illegal
re-entrants
whose
orders
may
be
reinstated
and
limited
the
possible
relief
from
a
removal
order
available
to
them.
the
petitioner,
humberto
fernandez-vargas,
a
citizen
of
mexico,
was
deported
in
1981,
but
illegally
returned
in
1982.
he
remained
in
the
country
undetected
for
over
20
years,
marrying
a
united
states
citizen
in
2001.
after
his
marriage,
fernandez-vargas
filed
an
application
to
adjust
his
status
to
that
of
lawful
permanent
resident,
but
the
government
responded
by
reinstating
his
1981
deportation
order
under
the
iirira
reinstatement
provision,
section
241(a)(5).
fernandez-vargas
petitioned
the
10th
circuit
to
review
the
reinstatement
order,
arguing
that
because
he
re-entered
the
county
before
iirira?s
effective
date,
he
was
not,
withstanding
241(a)(5),
still
eligible
for
adjustment
of
status
and
that
if
the
provision
did
bar
his
application,
it
would
be
impermissibly
retroactive.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
both
arguments.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
analyzes
a
claim
that
a
statute?s
operation
is
impermissibly
retroactive
by
first
looking
to
whether
the
statute
itself
clearly
discloses
its
proper
temporal
reach.
if
it
does
not,
we
ask
whether
applying
the
statute
to
the
person
objecting
would
have
a
retroactive
consequence
in
the
disfavored
sense
of
effecting
substantive
rights,
liabilities
or
duties
on
the
basis
of
conduct
arising
before
its
enactment.
if
the
answer
is
yes,
we
then
apply
the
presumption
against
retroactivity
by
construing
the
statute
as
inapplicable
to
the
event
or
the
act
in
question.
here,
congress
did
not
complement
241(a)(5)
with
any
clause
expressly
dealing
with
individuals
who
illegally
re-entered
the
country
before
iirira?s
effective
date.
but
common
principles
of
statutory
interpretation
fail
to
unsettle
the
apparent
application
of
241(a)(5)
to
any
re-entrant
present
in
the
country,
whatever
the
date
of
return.
fernandez-vargas
points
out
that
the
predecessor
of
241(a)(5)
had
some
language
that
made
it
clear
that
the
old
law
was
retroactive,
but
congress
took
that
language
out
when
it
passed
the
new
law.
but
we
do
not
think
that
helps
fernandez-vargas?
argument,
both
because
the
old
language
did
not
refer
to
the
date
of
re-entry
and
because
the
force
of
any
inference
of
prospectivity
that
might
be
drawn
from
its
removal
is
weakened
by
the
fact
that
iirira
made
other
provisions
expressly
applicable
to
only
post-effective-date
re-entries.
we
also
do
not
think
241(a)(5)
has
an
impermissibly
retroactive
effect
in
this
case.
the
provision
does
not
penalize
an
alien
for
a
past
act
that
he
is
helpless
to
undo;
it
is
the
conduct
of
remaining
in
the
country
after
re-entry
that
is
the
predicate
to
application
of
the
statute,
conduct
that
the
alien
could
end
by
voluntarily
leaving.
thus,
it
is
the
alien?s
choice
to
continue
his
illegal
presence
that
subjects
him
to
the
new
and
less-generous
legal
regime.
moreover,
fernandez-vargas
had
ample
opportunity
to
avoid
the
new
law?s
application
to
him
entirely,
for
241(a)(5)
did
not
go
into
effect
until
six
months
after
iirira?s
enactment.
fernandez-vargas
had
the
advantage
of
a
grace
period
between
the
unequivocal
notice
that
a
tougher
removal
regime
lay
ahead
and
the
actual
imposition
of
the
less-importune
terms
of
the
new
law,
but
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
statutory
warning.
the
presumption
against
retroactivity
does
not
support
a
claim
to
continue
illegal
conduct
indefinitely
under
the
terms
on
which
it
began,
and
we
therefore
do
not
find
any
retroactive
effect
here.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
