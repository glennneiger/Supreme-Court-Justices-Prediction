justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
this
case,
he
was
married
after
the
effective
date
of
the
new
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
judge
mcconnell,
in
the
tenth
circuit,
suggest...
because
he
discussed
this...
suggest
that
the
result
might
have
been
different
if
the
marriage
had
been
before?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
would
that
be
consistent
with
his...
with
his
analysis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
does
point
out
that
your
argument
is
a
difficult
one,
because
this
expectation
that
you
argue
for
is
that,
number
one,
he
has
an
expectation
that
he'd
be
able
to
adjust
his
status
even
after
congress
has
changed
the
law
respecting
reinstatement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
is
a
far
reaching
expectation
on
his
part.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
the
executive
couldn't
weigh
that.
you
say,
categorically,
it...
there's
no--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no
possibility
for
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
the...
could
the
ins
have
just
stayed
its
hand
for...
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
read
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
as
indicated
it
might
have
had
a
different
result
if
he
had
been
married
before
the
enactment
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
that
fit
with
the
court's
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
it--
