has
any...
a
number
of
courts
have
considered
this
question...
have
any
of
them
accepted
your
first...
your
argument
that
the
statute
is
clear
that
it
is
nonretroactive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'd...
i'll
have
to
look
at
those
decisions.
it
was
my
impression
that
they
did,
indeed,
hold
that
it
was
retroactive,
but
not
on
the
ground
that
congress
had
clearly
spoken
to
the
point,
so
that
you
didn't
need
any
further
inquiry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
readjustment
based
on
his
marriage
was
not
one
of
the
modes
of
relief
that
he
could
have
had
in
'82
or...
that
that
didn't
come
in
until
much
later,
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
any...
so,
that
was
a
consequence
that
certainly
wasn't
taken
away
from
him,
because
it
wasn't
there
in
'82.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't
know
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
in
st.
cyr--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was...
in
st.
cyr,
i
think
it
was
he
pled
guilty
under
one
set
of
expectations,
and
that's
what
the
court
fastened
on.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
he--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--might
not
have
pled
guilty
if
there
was
a
different
set
of
rules.
i
thought
that
was
what
drove
the
court's
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
instance--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
a
child--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--who
had...
he
had
a
relationship
to
a
child
in
the
united
states.
and
couldn't
that
have
counted
for
suspension
of
deportation
or
removal,
whatever
terms
i
use
now?
did--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
a
hardship
claim,
a
parent
child
relationship?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
was
here...
he
was
here
for
20--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--20
years,
though.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
it
farfetched,
in
view
of
the
history
of
now
i...
before
ins,
weren't
there
a
great
many
people
who
got
here
and...
just
as
this
petitioner...
who
just
lived
here
for
years
and
years,
and
were
never
disturbed?
