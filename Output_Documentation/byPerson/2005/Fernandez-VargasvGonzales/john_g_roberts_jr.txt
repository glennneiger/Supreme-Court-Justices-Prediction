justice
john
g.
roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
fernandez
vargas
versus
gonzales.
mr.
gossett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wouldn't
it
be
the
same
result
if
congress
decided,
for
example,
to
take
away
one
of
the
available
methods
of
seeking
discretionary
review,
just
saying,
"we're
not
going
to
have
that
available
anymore?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
would
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--a
pretty
easy
case,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
mechanism
saying
some...
an
alien
in
this
position
can
apply
for,
you
know,
this
type
of
relief,
this
type
of
relief,
or
another,
and
they
say,
"well,
we're
not
going
to
allow
this
type
of
relief
anymore.
"
"we're
going
to
change
those.
"
--was...
that's
a
pretty
easy
case,
under
landgraf,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
an--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
may
be
a
reasonable
inference,
but
i
think
it's
a
real
stretch
to
say
that
it
"clearly
establishes".
when
you're
talking
about
a
statute,
and
you
say
something's
"clear",
you
want
to
be
able
to
point
to
actual
words.
and,
on
the
other
side,
the
government
points
out
that,
elsewhere
in
iirira,
congress
specifically
delineates
when
it
wants
the
statute
to
apply
prospectively
only.
and
they
did
not
do
that
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i...
you
lost--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--me
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
looking
at
page--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
how--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
see
how
that
undermines
their
point
that
when
congress
wants
to
specify
that
something
"shall
apply
prospectively
only",
as
they
quote,
"only
with
respect
to
entries
occurring
on
or
after
a
date.
"
they
spell
it
out.
and
they
did
not
similarly
spell
it
out
in
the
provision
on...
that
you
suggest
is
prospective
only.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gossett.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
your
point,
though...
i
mean,
someone
illegally
reentering
at
that
time
might
not
have
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
the
availability
of
discretionary
relief.
on
the
other
hand,
someone
in
the...
a
petitioner's
position,
after
all
that
had
happened,
did
have
a
fairly
good
case
under
those
provisions
that
were
no
longer
available.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
someone
entering
says,
"well,
obviously,
if
i'm
detained
the
day
after
i
enter,
i'm
not
going
to
have
a
very
good
case.
"
"on
the
other
hand,
if
i'm
not,
and
i
happen
to
make
a
life
here,
and
i'm
here
for
20
years,
and
i
get
married
and
i
have
a
child,
i'm
going
to
have
a
strong
case.
"
and
he's
going
to...
he's
willing
to
take
his
chances.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
person
has
not
illegally
reentered
the
united
states?
he's
gone
back,
but
he
did
illegally
reenter
the
united
states.
he
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
same
provision
that
we're
talking
about?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gossett,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gossett.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
in
04-1376,
fernandez-vargas
v.
gonzales.
