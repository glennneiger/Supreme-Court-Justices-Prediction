justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
should
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
should
that
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
it's
retroactive
or
not?
i
mean,
if
it...
it
seems
to
me
you
look
to
the
activity
that
it
governs.
and
the
activity
that
it
governs
is
the
deportation
or
removal
from
now
on.
now,
you
could
argue
that...
if
you
want,
that
there
are
some
due
process
violations
in
making
that
prospective
law
affect
past
activities
as
they
do.
i
mean,
let's...
one
of
the
examples
given
in
landgraf,
or
at
least
in
my
concurrence
in
landgraf,
was
a
change
of
the
law
procedure
so
that
expert
testimony,
which
previously
was
not
admissible,
is
now
admissible.
now,
the
person
who
committed
the
crime
that's
involved
in
the
next
case
that
comes
up
when
that
new
procedural
rule
is
applied,
he
can
say,
"well,
you
know,
you've
changed...
you've
changed
the
rules
on
me.
"
"when
i
committed
the
crime,
the
expert
testimony
wasn't
admissible.
"
"now
it
is
admissible.
"
"that's
not
fair.
"
well,
whether
it's
fair
or
not
is
something
we
can
inquire
into
under
the
due
process
clause,
but
nobody
would
say
that
that
procedural
change
is
retroactive.
and
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--seems
to
me
that's
what's
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wasn't
my
point.
my
point--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was,
you
look
to
the...
to
the
activity
which
is
governed
by
the
new
law.
in
the
case
of
the...
of
the
expert
testimony,
the
activity
governed
is
the
trial,
so
that
law
applies
prospectively
to
all
future
trials.
so,
also,
in
this
case,
this
law
applies
prospectively
to
all
future
removals,
qed.
it
is
not
retroactive.
now,
you
may
have
an
argument,
although
i
don't
think
it's
a
very
good
one,
that
there
are
due
process
problems
involved
in
this
prospective
law.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
call
the
law
retroactive.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
affect--
justice
antonin
scalia
--doesn't
affect
his
reentry
at
all.
his
reentry
occurred.
it...
how
could
it
possibly
have
anything
to
do
with
his
reentry?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
apply
new
penalties
to
the
reentry.
this
law
does
not
apply
any
new
penalties
to
the
reentry,
it
just...
it
just
establishes
a
new
regime
for
removing
the
person
who
has
reentered.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
that's
because
they
were
using
the
version
of
stage
one
that
you
are
using,
which
includes,
in
the
consideration
of
whether
congress
has
been
clear,
an
inquiry
into
whether
the...
whether
the
law
is
retroactive
or
not,
which,
as
i
understand
it,
should
be
left
to
stage
two,
exclusively.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
analysis
in
your
brief
mingles
the
two.
it
says
one
of
the
factors
that
you
can
take
into
account
in
stage
one
is
whether
it's
retroactive.
and
as
i...
i
don't
understand
landgraf
to
speak
that
way.
i
thought
you
were
supposed
to
use
all
other
indicia
of
legislative
intent,
other
than
the
normal
rule
against
retroactivity,
in
deciding
congressional
intent,
and
then
you
go
to
stage
two,
which
is
where
retroactivity
comes
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
as
the
government
points
out,
that
"either
before
or
after"
applied
to
when
you
had
been
deported--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
to
when
you
reentered.
and
what
we're...
what
you're
arguing
for
here
is
a
rule
that
goes
from
the
time
of
reentry,
not
from
the
time
of
deportation.
so,
it's
not
really
a
parallel.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish
we
could
get
some
new
vocabulary.
terminology
is
destiny,
and
i
really
don't
follow
the
discussion
of
speaking
about
whether
it
was
prospective
or
retroactive.
i
don't
think,
whichever
way
it
applied,
it
is
retroactive.
but
the
issue
still
remains,
did
congress
intend
pre
iirira
reentries
to
be
covered
or
not?
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
consider
that
still
prospective,
but
just
note
my--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
along
with
you
when
you
force
this
terminology
on
me,
whether
congress
intended
it
to
be
retroactive.
as
i
see
it,
the
issue
is
whether
congress
intended
it
to
apply
to
reentries
that
occurred
before
iirira
was
enacted.
i
would
not
consider
that
retroactive,
but
it's
still
an
open
question
what
congress
intended.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would...
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
this
to
apply
to
illegal
entrants
who
had
come
in
before
iirira.
bear
in
mind,
these
are
people
who
have
been
deported
once,
already
deported
once,
and
then,
in
violation
of
the
law,
come
back
in
again.
and
there
was
a
regime
for
deporting
them,
which
allowed
certain
variations,
which
are
eliminated
by
iirira,
permission
for
them
to
stay.
you
really
think
congress
wanted
to
keep
faith
with
the
people
who
had,
already
have...
having
been
deported
once
for
illegal
reentry...
illegal
entry...
come
in
again...
and
you
think
congress
says,
"oh,
well,
you
know,
we
have
to
keep
faith
with
these
people
who
are
violating
our
law,
and
not...
and
not
deport
them
except
under
the
conditions
that
existed
when
they
broke
the
law
to
reenter?
"
i
find
that
a
very...
what
should
i
say
+/?
touching--
[laughter]
--attitude
for
congress
to
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
only
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--disincentives.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
trying
to
get
out
of
the
country
people
who
were
here
illegally,
two
time
losers
who
were
here
illegally
for
the
second
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
he
think
that?
why
wouldn't
he
just
think,
being
here
illegally,
he
is
subject
to
being
deported
under
such
rules
as
the
country
has
for
deporting
people
who
are
here
illegally,
whatever
they
may
be,
from
time
to
time?
that
would
be
my
expectation
if
i
came
in
illegally,
in
violation
of
the
law.
i'm
saying,
"i'm
here
at
the
sufferance
of
the
country.
"
"i
shouldn't
be
here.
"
"and
whatever
rules
they
have
for
kicking
me
out
are
the
rules
that
i'll
have
to
abide
by.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
"i'm
lucky
not
to
be
in
jail.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
and
those--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
those
provisions
are
specifically
recited
to
apply
only
to
reentrants
after
the
effective
date.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
want
us
to
decide
it
on
that
ground,
do
you,
so
that
all
future
cases
you'll
have
to
decide
whether
he
came
in
before
'94
or
after
'94,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
say
'84
or
'94?
i
couldn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
imagine
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
say,
i
cannot
imagine
that.
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
even
if
he
was,
that
was
waivable.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
he
doesn't
automatically
get
admitted
because
he's
married,
does
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
discretionary,
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
discretion--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
another
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
or,
put
more
starkly,
if
i
continue
to
violate
the
law
for
7
years,
i
can
count
on
this
kind
of
treatment.
that's
an
odd
reliance
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
truly.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
gives
the
other
side
the...
you
know,
the
benefit
of
their
argument.
i
think
what
they're
arguing
is
not
just
that
it
was
deleted,
but
that
it
was
not
replaced
by...
whether
iirira,
rather
than
the
date
of
the
ina.
i
have...
nobody
thinks
that
they
would
leave
in
june
27,
1952,
but
why
wouldn't
they
have
substituted,
for
that,
the
date
of
this
new
legislation,
the
date
of
iirira?
i
think
that's
the
point
he's
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
isn't
there
something
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
getting
rid
of
old
language
that
was
no
longer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
intentionally
not
adding
new
language.
