mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
section
1231(a)(5)
aims
to
streamline
the
removal
of
aliens
who
were
already
removed
but
have
since
illegally
reentered.
the
congress
that
enacted
iirira
did
not
intend
to
grandfather
the
provision
and
exempt
those
aliens
who
are
already
in
the
country
illegally.
rather,
the
focus
on
streamlining
the
rules
for
getting
illegal
reentrants
out
of
the
country
is
fully
applicable,
and,
indeed,
is
especially
applicable
to
illegal
reentrants
who
were
already
in
the
country
at
the
time
of
iirira's
enactment.
three
considerations,
i
think,
point
to
the
conclusion
that
section
1231(a)(5)
is
addressed
to
removing
illegal
reentrants
from
the
country,
including
aliens
who
are
already
in
the
country,
and
that
the
provision
is
not
so
much
addressed
to
the
antecedent
act
of
illegal
reentry,
as
such.
the
first
consideration
i
would
point
to
is
the
operation
of
the
provision.
and
it's
useful
to
bear
in
mind
the
following
possible
scenario
in
which
a
person,
who's
been
removed,
illegally
reenters
the
country,
but
then
returns
to
his
home
country.
now,
in
that
situation
the
individual
would
have
engaged
in
the
act
of
illegal
reentry,
but
section
1231(a)(5)
simply
would
have
no
relevance
to
him
whatsoever,
because
what
section
1231(a)(5)
seeks
to
do
is
to
remove
someone
who's
found
in
the
country
on
the
basis
of
their
previous
removal
order.
now,
if
they
have
engaged
in
the
act
of
illegal
reentry,
but
then
have
gone
back,
section
1231(a)(5)
simply
is
not
relevant.
and
i
think
that
goes
to
show
that
what
the
statute
is
focused
on
is
not
the
act
of
illegal
reentry,
as
such,
but,
rather,
removing
someone
who's
found
in
the
country
and
who's
determined
to
be
an
illegal
reentrant.
now,
that
operation
stands
in
significant
contrast
to
the
criminal
prohibition
against
illegal
reentry,
which
is
at
8
u.s.c.
1326,
and
the
prohibition
against
illegal
entry,
which
is
8
u.s.c.
1325.
with
respect
to
both
of
those
provisions,
the
act
of
illegal
reentry,
or
the
act
of
illegal
entry,
necessarily
triggers
the
operation
of
the
criminal
prohibition,
and
there's
nothing
that
the
alien
can
do
after
the
fact
to
take
himself
outside
of
the...
of
the
purview
of
that
criminal--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
congress
specifically
indicated,
in
the
text
of
iirira,
that
it's...
it
understood
the
distinction
between
the
way
in
which
those
provisions
operate
and
the
way
that
1231(a)(5)
operates.
the
iirira
expanded
the
scope
of
the
criminal
prohibition
on
an
illegal
reentry,
and
it
also,
for
the
first
time,
imposed
civil
monetary
penalties
on
the
act
of
illegal
entry.
there
were
civil
fines,
and
then...
i
think,
$50
to
$250
per
episode.
but
what's
critical
is
that
with
respect
to
both
of
those
changes,
congress
specified,
in
the
terms
of
iirira,
that
they
would
only
apply,
on
a
prospective
basis,
to
acts
of
illegal
entry
or
reentry
that
post
dated
iirira.
now,
congress
made
no
such
specification
with
respect
to
1231(a)(5),
and
i
think
that's
significant,
because
what
that
indicates
is
that
congress
understood
that
that
provision,
unlike
the
two
criminal...
unlike
the
two
criminal
provisions,
focuses
not
on
the
act
of
illegal
reentry,
as
such,
but
rather--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right,
justice--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--souter.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
the
criminal
act
is
completed
at
the
moment
that
the
criminal
reentry
is
completed,
and
nothing
that
he
does
afterwards
can
take--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
which
is
different,
obviously,
from
the
operation
of
section
1231(a)(5).
now,
another
consideration
that
i
think
indicates
that
section
1231(a)(5)
is
focused
on
the
timing
of
the
removal,
as
opposed
to
the
timing
of
reentry,
is
to
take
into
account
section
1231(a)(5)
in
the
context
of
section
1231
as
a
whole.
section
1231
was
a
new
provision
that
was
enacted
by
iirira,
and
congress
entitled
it,
quote,
"detention
and
removal
of
aliens
ordered
removed.
"
close
quote.
and,
as
its
title
indicates,
the
provisions
in
section
1231,
like
1231(a)(5),
all
pertain
to
executing
an
order
of
removal
against
an
alien
who's
been
ordered
removed.
for
example,
those
provisions
concern
the
time
period
within
which
somebody
is
to
be
removed.
they
address
the
travel
of
somebody
to
the
removal
destination,
the
identification
of
the
countries
to
which
they
may
be
removed,
the
payment
of
expenses.
but
all
of
them
address
the
execution
of
an
order
of
removal
in
the
same
way
that
section
1231(a)(5)
does.
section
1231(a)(5)
speaks
to
the
execution
of
the
preexisting
order
of
removal,
the
one
that
the
alien
had
in
place
when
he
illegally
reentered
the
country,
but
it's
of
a
piece
with
those
other
provisions,
in
the
sense
that
it,
like
them,
addresses
the
timing
of
removal
rather
than
speaking
to
the
act
of
illegal
reentry,
as
such.
the
third
consideration,
i
think,
that
points
to
the
same
conclusion,
which
is
that
congress
was
focused
prospectively
on
removals
that
postdated
iirira,
rather
than
retrospectively,
in
some
sense,
on
acts
of
illegal
reentry
that
predated
iirira,
is
that
at
the
time
of
illegal
reentry,
as
we
explain
in...
at
length
in
our
brief,
an
alien
would
have
had
no
eligibility,
as
a
categorical
matter,
and
at
least
as
a
practical
matter,
for
the
three
types
of
relief
that
petitioner
invokes.
and
those
three
types
of
relief
are
adjustment
of
status,
suspension
of
deportation,
and
voluntary
departure.
now,
with
respect
to
adjustment
of
status,
as
the
colloquy
earlier
indicated,
at
the
time
that
petitioner
illegally
reentered
the
country
in
1981,
up
until
1994,
which
was
just
2
years
before
iirira,
adjustment
of
status
was
categorically
unavailable
to
illegal
entrants
and
illegal
reentrants.
in
that
light,
it's...
one
would
be
hard
pressed
to
assert
that
an
illegal
reentrant
would
have
performed
that
act
in
reasonable
reliance
on
the
availability
of
adjustment
of
status.
it
was
simply--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--unavailable.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
i
think
a
virtue
of
focusing
on
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
addressed
to
the
removal,
rather
than
the
act
of
illegal
reentry,
is
that
it
decides,
once
and
for
all,
what
the
temporal
reach
of
the
statute
is.
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
that
might
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
his
claim
is
that
section
1231(a)(5)
should
be
construed
not
to
apply
to
anyone
who
illegally
reentered
before
iirira.
and
so,
i
think
the
proper
frame
of
reference
is
to
look,
ex
ante,
at
what
someone
would
be
thinking,
had
they
illegally
reentered
before
iirira,
because
he
seeks
to
treat
everyone
who
illegally
reentered
before
iirira
as
a
uniform
category.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
two
responses.
first
of
all,
that's
not
true
with
respect
to
adjustment
of
status,
because
someone
who
reentered
before
iirira,
at
least
if
they
reentered
before
1984,
couldn't
have
imagined
that
their
marriage
to
a
united
states
citizen
would
have
given
them
a
basis
for
adjustment,
because
adjustment
simply
was
categorically
unavailable
to
illegal
entrants.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
1994,
i'm
sorry--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
didn't...
i...
in
'81,
when
he
illegally
reentered,
through
1994,
adjustment
of
status
was
categorically
unavailable
to
people
who
illegally
reentered,
so
he
couldn't--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--have
relied
on
the
availability
of
that
form
of
relief.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
simply
wasn't
provided--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
simply
wasn't
provided
for
by
statute.
a
precondition
of
eligibility
for
adjustment,
until
1994,
was
that
the
person
was
not
an
illegal
entrant.
so--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
mean,
i
suppose
they
could
have
stayed
their
hand,
in
the
sense
that
they
wouldn't
have
applied
the
immigration
laws
to
begin
with,
but
i
don't
think
there--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--would
have
been
any
basis
to
stay
their
hand,
in
the
sense
of
granting--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--adjustment
of
status.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
not
with
respect
to
adjustment
of
status.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes,
i'm
speaking--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--technically,
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
is...
there's
another
form
of
relief
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--conceivably
could
give
them
a
claim--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--and
that's
suspension
of
deportation--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--which
is
the
same--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
there's
a
lot
in
that
question.
let
me
just
try
to
address
it
one
step
at
a
time.
with
respect
to
whether
it
attaches
new
legal
consequences,
i
think
you
were
right,
justice
breyer,
earlier,
in
asking
about
what
would
happen
if
he
had
gone
back
voluntarily.
now,
it's
true
that
if
he
had
been
removed,
then
there
would
have
been
the
consequence,
in
the
sense
that
there
would
be
a
period
of
inadmissibility,
at
least
presumptive
inadmissibility,
a
period,
which,
by
the
way,
is
subject
to
waiver,
which
he
could
apply
for.
but
if
he
had
just
gone
back
voluntarily
after
iirira's
enactment,
or,
indeed,
in
the
6-month
window
between
iirira's
enactment
and
iirira's
effective
date,
my
understanding
is
that
there
would
have
been
no
presumptive
period
of
inadmissibility.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
the
five...
the
5-year
period
that
petitioners...
mr.
gossett
was
referring
to,
i
think,
relates
to
the
period
after
the
point
in
time
at
which
somebody's
deported
or
removed.
and
so,
his
initial
deportation--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--he
would--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
my--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--understanding.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
he...
you're
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it's...
that
he's
illegally
reentered.
but
he
wouldn't
be
covered
by
this
provision,
because
all
this
provision
seeks
to
do
is
to
remove
him.
and
then,
once
he's
gone
back,
this
provision
simply
ceases
to
have
any
relevance
to
him
at
all,
because
he's,
in
some
sense,
self
removed.
and
so,
he...
any
ineligibility
wouldn't
stem
from
this
provision,
it
would
come
from
somewhere
else.
and,
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
he
wouldn't...
he
wouldn't
be
subject
to
the
5-year
period
of
inadmissibility
that's
imposed
by
a
separate
provision
and
that
would
attach
if
he
were
removed,
because,
by
hypothesis,
he
wouldn't
have
removed,
he
would
have
gone
back
on
his
own
accord.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
that's
subject
to
waiver,
which
is
another--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right.
that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
discretionary--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--at
the
end
of
the
day--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--as
well.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
and
we
lay
this
out
in
some
detail
in
a...
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
and
that's
at...
that's
at
pages
39
to
40.
but
that
footnote,
i
should
point
out,
doesn't
deal
with
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
which
is
that
he
goes
back
of...
on
his
own
accord.
and,
i
think,
in
that
situation
what
he
would
do
is
what
people
ordinarily
do
when
they're
seeking
to
gain
lawful
admission
to
the
country,
which
is
to
apply
for
admission
on
the
basis
of
what
would
have
been
whatever
relationships
he
could
have
asserted
at
that
point.
now,
he
wasn't
married
at
the
time
that
iirira
was
enacted,
so
he
wouldn't
have
used
his
marriage
as
a
basis
for
coming
in,
because
he
wasn't
married
as
of
yet.
but
i
think
that
cuts
more
against
him,
rather
than
in
his
favor,
because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--of
course--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
it
would
count
for
purposes
of
suspension
of
deportation,
which
was
renamed
cancellation
of
removal.
but
that
form
of
relief
is
available
to
somebody
who's
inside
the
united
states,
and
i
was
meaning
to
address
the
situation
where
he
has
voluntarily
removed
himself
from
the
united
states
and
is
seeking
admission
from,
presumably,
mexico,
in
which
case,
suspension
of
deportation
wouldn't
really
come
into
play,
because
deportation
wouldn't
be
on
the
table.
but,
you're
right
that
if
he
had
stayed
in
the
country,
suspension
of
deportation
is
a
form
of
relief
that
he
would
have
been
eligible
for...
eligible
for,
pre
iirira.
but,
with
respect
to
suspension
of
deportation,
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
that
form
of
relief
required
an...
a
period
of
presence
in
the
united
states
of
7
years
before
one
could
gain
eligibility
to
seek
that
relief.
and
so--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--he--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--he
was.
so,
he
would
have
clearly
met
that
eligibility
criteria...
there
is
no
question
about
that...
under
the
preexisting
law.
but
if
you
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
somebody
who
is
entering,
pre
iirira,
and
is
trying
to
determine
whether
suspension
of
deportation
is
relief
that
would
be
realistically
available
to
them,
you'd
have
to
think
that
they
would
act
on...
in
reliance
on
their
ability
to
stay
in
the
country
for
7
years,
and
to
remain
undetected,
only
at
which
point
they
would
qualify
for
suspension
of
deportation.
and
that
not
only
seems
to
me,
as
a
factual
matter,
somewhat
farfetched,
but
it's
not
clear
that
the
law
should
attach
significance
to
that
sort
of
reliance--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--interest.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
as
an...
as
an
empirical
matter,
i
think
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that
necessarily
means
that
that's
a
legitimate
expectation
or
a
reasonable
reliance
interest
of
the
type
that
the
court
would
typically
take
into
account
in
its
retroactivity
inquiry,
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
it
is,
is
a
reliance
interest
that's
predicated
on
essentially
lack
of
prosecutorial
resources,
or
a
favorable
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion
in
some
sense.
and
the
court
hasn't
attached
significance
to
that
sort
of
reliance
before.
it's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right,
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--particularly
taking
into
account
the
reasonable
reliance...
the
category
"reasonable
reliance"
is
designed
to
take...
is
designed
to--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--account
for
its
fairness--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--interests.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
i
think
the
presumption--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--against
retroactive--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
the
consequence
of
removal
is
more
serious--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--than...
in
some
sense,
than
a
$50
penalty.
that's
right.
but
this
is
a
person--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right,
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure.
i
think
it
affects
anyone
who
had
illegally
reentered,
at
least.
but
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
somebody
who
was
already
subject
to
a
removal
order.
so,
in
some
sense,
sending
them
back
out
of
the
country
puts
them
in
the
same
position
that
they
would
have
been
in
under
the
old
removal
order.
and
so,
insofar
as
it
has
that
effect
on
them,
i
think
it's
different
than
a
$50
penalty
that
attaches
to
the
primary
conduct
of
illegal
reentry,
as
such.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
is
that
suggestion,
i
think,
in
judge
mcconnell's
opinion,
and
that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--with
the...
with
the
tenth
circuit's
theory
or--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
think--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
idea
was...
i
think
what
the
tenth
circuit
failed
to
recognize
was
that
adjustment
of
status
was
categorically
unavailable
to
somebody
who
illegally
reentered
before
iirira,
at
least
before
1994.
and
what
judge
mcconnell
presumed
was
that
it
would
have
been
available.
and
his
point
was
that
even
if
it
would
have
been
available,
it's
farfetched
to
think
that
somebody
would
have
thought
not
only
about
coming
into
the
country,
but
coming
into
the
country
and
then
meeting
a
united
states
citizen,
and
become
married
to
the
united
states
citizen,
and
using
that
as
sort
of
a
reliance
basis
for
not
applying
the
law
retroactively
to
somebody
who
had
come
in
beforehand.
but
i
think
that
was
based
on
a
misimpression
about
the
availability
of
adjustment
of
status.
now,
i'd
like
to
address,
briefly,
if
i
could,
the
argument
at
step
one
of
the
landgraf
inquiry
concerning
the
negative
inference
the
petitioner
seeks
to
draw
from
the
"before
or
after"
clause...
so
called
"before
or
after"
clause.
and
the
two
provisions
can
be
compared
side
by
side
at
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government's
brief,
and
that's
in
the
body
of
the
government's
brief.
the
fundamental
flaw
with
the
argument
at
step
one
is
that
the
2,
referred,
by
terms,
to
the
date
of
the
ina's
enactment.
now,
what
we've
reflected
is
the
codified
version,
which
refers
specifically
to
the
date
of
june
27
of
1952.
but
even
the
ina
itself
referred
to
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act,
which
can
only
be
seen
to
refer
to
the
ina
itself.
so,
if
this
language
had
been
carried
forward
in
section
1231(a)(5),
it
still
would
have
been
a
reference
to
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
ina.
so,
it
would
refer
to
somebody
who
was
deported
before
or
after
1952.
now,
i
think,
as
justice
alito
suggested,
the
probable
reason
that
congress
decided
not
to
carry
forward
this
language
is
because
the
question
of
whether
someone
was
deported
before
or
after
1952
doesn't
have
a
great
deal
of
practical
significance
at
this
point
in
time.
but
whatever
one
might
think
was
the
actual
reason
for
congress's
failing
to
carry
forward
the
language,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
draw
any
negative
inference
from
congress's
failure
to
carry
forward
that
language,
at
least
certainly
not
the
negative
inference
that
petitioner
wants
to
draw.
in
fact,
the
negative
inference
that
one
would
draw,
if
one
were
going
to
do
so,
is
that
the
section
1231(a)(5)
applies
only
to
people
who
were
deported
initially
after
1952.
but
that
sort
of
negative
inference
wouldn't
be
of
much
assistance
to
petitioner,
or
any
other
person,
for
that
matter,
that
illegally
reentered
before
iirira,
at
least
as
a
practical
matter,
because
everybody,
i
think,
in
that
category,
would
have
illegally
reentered...
or
would
have
been
deported
after
1952--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i...
it's...
there's
certainly
not
enough
there
to
make
the
argument
that
he's
making,
i
don't
think,
because
what
was...
what
congress
did
was
to
replace
that
provision
with
utter
silence.
and
from
that
utter
silence,
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
to
read
into
it
that
congress
meant
for
the
applicability
of
section
1231(a)(5)--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
to
read
into
it
the
inference
that
congress
meant
to
hinge
the
applicability
of
section
1231(a)(5)
on
iirira's
enactment
date.
there
never
was
a
proposal
on
the
table
to
hinge
section
1231(a)(5)'s
applicability
on
iirira's
enactment
date.
the
only
possibility
was
to
keep
the
old
provision
in
the
statute
books
unaffected,
and
the
decision
not
do
that
doesn't
have
the
negative
inference
that
petitioner
suggests.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions--
