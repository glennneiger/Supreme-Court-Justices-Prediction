mr.
david
m.
gossett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
using
the
ordinary
tools
of
statutory
construction,
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
the
1996
reinstatement
provision
to
apply
only
prospectively.
but
even
if
congress
had
no
specific
intent
as
to
the
retroactive
applicability
of
that
provision,
under
landgraf
it
would,
nonetheless,
not
apply
in
this
case.
applying
it
to
aliens
who
reentered
before
iirira's
effective
date
would
give
the
statute
an
impermissively
retroactive
effect.
before
iirira,
such
aliens
were
entitled
to
seek,
and
eligible
to
receive,
discretionary
relief
from
deportation.
now
if
the
provision
is
applied
to
them,
they
are
not.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
congress
might
change
the
specific
types
of
review
that
are
available,
and
then
this
court
would
have
to...
but
would
either
have
to...
would
have
to
engage
in
a
landgraf
analysis
of
whether--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--that
would
be--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--the...
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
transition
from
suspension
of
deportation
to
cancellation
of
removal
would
fall
into
that
category.
however,
the
reinstatement
provision
talks
in
terms...
in
categorical
terms
of
any
forms
of
relief
from
deportation.
it
doesn't
specify
the
particular
types
of
relief
that
would
be
available--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--and,
therefore--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--two--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--two
responses,
justice
scalia.
the
first
is,
i
think
it's
unfair
to
say
that
this
provision
merely
regulates
the
procedure
of
removal.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
the--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--justice
scalia,
the
portions
of
the
reinstatement
provision,
besides
for
the
provision
barring
other
forms
of
relief,
i
would
agree,
are
simply
procedural
provisions.
and,
again,
there
might
be
due
process
challenges
to
those,
but
i...
we're
not
raising
those
here.
it's
the
provision
that
says
that
merely
because
you
illegally
reentered
the
country
at
some
prior
date,
you
will...
because
you
illegally
reenter
the
country,
you
will
be
ineligible,
that
i
think
can
only
fairly
be
categorized
as
regulating
the
process
of
reentry,
not
the
process
of
removal.
it's--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--the
fact
that
you--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--under
your
honor's
analysis,
a
statute
that
said
that
if
the
attorney
general
finds
that
an
alien
has
reentered
in
the
past,
the
alien
may
be
sentenced
to
15
years
in
prison,
would
also
merely
be
procedural
and
governing
the
sentencing
rather
than
the
underlying
act
of
reentry.
i
think
that
parallel
hypothetical,
which
obviously
would...
would
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--but
the
act
of
removing
the
right
to
seek
adjustment
of
status,
suspension
of
deportation,
voluntary
departure,
that
is
a
new
penalty.
in
the
landon
v.
placencia
case,
in
fact,
this
court
called
those
"substantive
rights".
it
called,
specifically,
voluntary
departure
and
suspension
of
deportation
"substantive
rights".
that's
at
459
u.s.
26
to
27.
therefore,
i
think
it's
unfair
to
say
that
the
removal
of
those
substantive
rights
is
merely
a
procedural
change.
of
course,
we
don't
even
get
into
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
procedural
change
here,
or
a
substantive
change,
unless
we
get
to
stage
two
of
the
landgraf
analysis
under
the...
under,
i
would
say,
either
the
majority's
approach
in
landgraf
or
your
approach,
justice
scalia,
because
the
first
stage
of
landgraf
is
about
this
court's
deferring
to
congress's
specific
intent
as
to
the
applicability
of
a
statute,
because
if
congress
has
decided
whether
a
statute
should
apply
prospectively
or
retroactively,
this
court
defers
to
that,
outside
of
the
ex
post
facto
context.
and
i
think
here
it's
clear
that,
in
fact,
congress
intended
the
1996
reinstatement
provision
to
apply
only
prospectively.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
both
the
sixth
and
the
ninth
circuits
have
accepted
that
argument.
they've
accepted
it
in
a
slightly
different
form
than
we
are
currently
raising,
because
before
the
government's
brief
in
this
case,
no
one
has
laid
out
the
history
of
the
1950
and
1952
statutes
as
carefully
as
the
solicitor
general's
office
now
has.
but
both
the
sixth
and
ninth
circuit
have
held
that
this
statute
is
exclusively
prospective
by
a
comparison
between
the
1952
act
and
the
1996
act.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
both...
they
didn't
use
the
term
"clearly",
because,
of
course,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
there's
an
asymmetry
in
retroactivity
analysis,
and
using
the
ordinary
tools
of
statutory
construction,
one
can
demonstrate
a
prospective
intent
on
the
part
of
congress.
but
both
the
sixth
and
the
ninth
circuit,
in
the
bejjani
case
and
the
castro
cortez
case,
did
stop
their
retroactivity
analysis
at
stage
one
of
the
landgraf
inquiry--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--decided
that.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
i--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--in
both
the
st.
cyr's
case
and
the
lindh
case,
this
court
did
invoke
the
presumption
against
retroactivity
in
its
stage
one
analysis.
but,
more
generally,
i
don't
think
we
need
a
presumption
to
win
this
case.
i
think
that...
under
stage
one,
under
an
inquiry
into
congressional
intent...
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
history
of
congress
providing
for
the
reinstatement
of
deportation
that
goes
back
to
1950.
in
1950,
congress
passed
a
reinstatement
provision
that
said
that
for
the
specified
aliens...
and
it
was
only
a
subgroup...
if
they
were
deported
and
reentered,
they
would
be...
that
their
previous
deportation
order
would
be
reinstated.
the
ins...
and
that
statute's
quoted
in
page
2
of
the
government's
brief...
the
ins
interpreted
that
statute
as
applying
only
prospectively,
and
only
applying
to
an
alien
who
was
deported,
and,
therefore,
obviously
reinstated...
reentering
after
the
effective
date
of
that
statute.
now,
in
1952,
congress,
evidently
dissatisfied
with
an
interpretation...
with
a
reinstatement
provision
that
was
only
prospective,
added
the
"before
or
after"
language
to
the
reinstatement
provision.
they
said,
under
this
1952
act,
"if
you
were
deported,
either
before
or
after
the
effective
date
of
the
ina,
your
deportation
order
can
be
reinstated.
"
but
in
1996,
congress
removed
that
"before
or
after"
clause.
congress
expanded
the
scope
of
reinstatement
and
provided
that
a
much
broader
category
of
reentrants
could
be
subject
to
reinstatement.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
actually,
justice
scalia,
under
our
stage
one
argument,
we
are
now
arguing
that,
in
fact,
the
government
is
right,
that
the
1952
act
was
tied
to
the
date
of
deportation.
what
we
don't
understand
is
how
the
government
thinks
that
helps
its
case,
because
the
obvious
and
necessary
consequence
of
that
is
that
the
removal
of
the
1996
must
imply
that
the
1996
provision
only
is
triggered
by
post
enactment
deportations.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
and--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--they
also
specifically
delineated,
in
some
context,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
would
be
retroactive.
the
government's
primary
comparison...
and
i
think
it's
an
important
one
for
this
court
to
focus
on...
is
to
the
criminal
reinstatement
provision,
which
is
section
1326...
8
u.s.c.
at
1326.
now,
the
government
asserts
that
that
provision
is
exclusively
prospective,
and,
therefore,
that
the
comparison
should
be
that,
in
this
context,
the
reinstatement
provision
must
be
retroactive.
but,
in
so
arguing,
the
government
hides,
in
ellipses
in
its
brief,
on
page
14,
the
actual
text
of
the
provision
of
the
criminal...
the
temporal
applicability
of
the
criminal
reentry
provision.
what
congress
actually
said
was
that
deportations
that
predate
iirira
could
trigger
reinstatement,
but
reentries
post...
only
reentries
post
dating
iirira
could
trigger
it.
so,
in
fact,
what
congress
was
doing
in
the
criminal
context
was
reaching
back
and
saying,
"we're
changing
the
consequences
of
pre
enactment
deportations,
but
not
pre
enactment
reentry.
"
so,
the
comparison,
if
anything,
i
think,
strengthens
our
case.
i'd
say--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--the--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
that's
on--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--page--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--it's
quoted
on
page
27,
note
15,
of
our
opening
brief.
it's
section
324(c)
of
iirira.
i
can
read
it,
exactly,
"the
amendment
made
by
subsection
(a)
expanding
the
criminal
reentrant
provision
shall
apply
to
departures
that
occurred
before,
on,
or
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act,
but
only
with
respect
to
entries
and
attempted
entries
occurring
on
or
after
such
date.
"
the
government
omits
the
fact
that
it
applies
to
deportations
pre
iirira.
so,
i
think
that
there
are
two
cases
that
this
court
has--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--decided--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--no,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
i
agree
that
this
doesn't
explicitly
spell
it
out
in
the
criminal
provision,
but
i
don't
think
we
need
to
explicitly
spell
it
out...
or
we...
that
this
court
needs
to
find
that
congress
explicitly
spelled
out
the
prospective
applicability.
i
think
that
the
lindh
case
and
the
american
national
red
cross
case
both
demonstrate
that
when
congress
changes
text
over
time,
it
matters.
in
the
lindh
case,
of
course,
there
were
two
provisions,
one
of
which
had
retroactivity
language,
the
other
which
had
none,
and...
and
this
court
intuited
that,
"therefore,
congress
must
have
meant
that
the...
the
section
without
retroactivity
language
would
be
exclusively--
"
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--was
it
triggered?
mr.
david
m.
gossett
i--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--i
think,
actually--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--justice
scalia,
i
agree...
i
agree
that
that's
for
purposes...
that
terminology
is
better
for
stage
one.
it's...
whether
it
was
triggered
by
a
pre
enactment
deportation
or
reentry.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
i
don't
think
either
of
those
possibilities
is
plausible,
justice
alito.
the
first
is
implausible
because
we
know
that
the
ins
had
already
interpreted
the
1950
act,
which
was
silent
as
to
applicability,
to
be
exclusively
prospective.
and
the
second
is
implausible
because
the...
the
1952
act,
which
would
presumably
have
been
brought
forward,
the
1996
act,
had
they
wanted
to,
specified
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act.
it
would
have
been
about
this
act.
and,
in
fact,
the
senate
proposal
to
modify
the
first...
the
provision
also
would
have
left
it
in
terms
of
this
act,
not
of
a
specific
date
of
1952,
which
would
have
been
the
ina
date.
more
generally,
i
think
that
with
this
history
of
the
1950
act,
the
1952
act,
and
the
1996
act,
any
interpretation
of
the
1996
act
as
being
retroactive,
or
as
being
ambiguously
retroactive,
doesn't
pay
adequate
deference
to
congress's
choice
over
time
that
this
act
should
apply
prospectively
in
1996.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
justice
scalia,
clearly
congress
was
attempting
to
change...
or
to
increase
the
disincentives
to
reentry.
at
the
same
time
that
they
modified
the
reinstatement
provision,
they
extended
the
criminal
reentry
provisions.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
so,
the
question
isn't--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--whether--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--the
question,
however,
though,
is
not
whether
they
were
trying
to
change
that
consequence.
the
question
is
whether
they
did
so
retroactively,
because
this
court
presumes
that
if
congress
is
trying
to
change
the
consequences
of
an
action
that
has
occurred
in
the
past
in
substantive
ways,
congress
should
say
so
explicitly,
because,
as
your...
you
have
said
in
previous
decisions,
it
is
a
foundational
principle
of
western
law
that
primary...
the
consequences
of
primary
conduct
are
judged
as--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--of
the
time
of
that
conduct.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
i
presume,
justice
breyer,
you
mean
at
the
time
that
congress
enacted
iirira?
mr.
david
m.
gossett
was--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--that--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--no,
justice
breyer,
it
does
not,
because
had
he
left
in
1996,
upon
enactment
of
iirira,
he
would
have
been
inadmissible
for
5
years--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--as
a
result
of
having
left.
whereas,
otherwise,
otherwise,
if
he
had
stayed
in
the
country,
he
would
be
eligible
to
apply
for
suspension
of
deportation--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--as
a
result
of
his
initial...
having
reentered--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--within
5
years--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--as
a
result
of
his
reentry
five...
within
5
years
of
the
date
of
his
1981
deportation,
he
would
be
ineligible
for
readmission
for
5
years,
had
he
left
the
country.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
or
10
to
20
years,
if--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--ten
to
20
years
if
you're
caught,
under
this
act,
is
my
understanding.
it
depends
on...
the
government--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--yes.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
no,
we...
if
he
stays
in
the
united
states,
he's...
and
is--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--entitled
to
apply
for
these
forms
of
relief
from
deportation,
then
he
will...
then
he
can
become
an
american
citizen,
or
become
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
as
a
result
of
the
forms--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--of
relief
that
existed--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--ten
to
20
years.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
ten
to
20.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
yes.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
but,
of
course,
at
the
time...
pre
iirira,
the
choice
was,
stay
in
the
country
and
seek...
and
seek
american
citizenship
through
these
other
routes.
and
so,
the
forcing
of
him
to
leave
is
itself
a
retroactive
effect
of
the
enactment
of
this
act--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--because--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
yes,
he
did
suggest
that.
and
several
courts
have--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--justice...
judge
mcconnell
and
several
other
courts
have
focused
on
the
types
of
relief
that
an
alien
was
eligible
for
as
of
the
effective
date
of
iirira.
we
think
that's
the
wrong
first
inquiry.
we
think
that
the
way
to
approach
the
stage
two
analysis
is
on
a
categorical
basis,
because
congress,
in
the
statute,
said
that,
at
the
time
of
reentry,
the
mere
act
of
reentry
wouldn't
categorically
preclude
you
from
seeking
any
forms
of
relief
from
deportation.
and
so,
had
congress
wanted
to
change
that,
it
would
have...
it
would
have
had
to
do
so
retroactively
on
a
categorical
basis.
but
even
if
one
accepts
judge
mcconnell's
analysis
of
the
forms
of
relief
you're
entitled
to
as
of
that
date,
at
the
very
least,
at
that
point,
my
client
would
be
eligible
to
seek
both
voluntary
departure
and
cancellation
of
removal.
we
think
he'd...
also
should
be
eligible
to
seek
adjustment
of
status,
because,
although
it's
true
that
he
is
not...
he
was
not,
at
that
point,
married
to
his
now
wife,
adjustment
of
status
was
a...
is
a
defense
from
deportation,
and
he
would
have
been
able
to
get
married
even
if
put
into
deportation
proceedings.
and
given
that,
at
that
point,
he
and
his
now
wife
had...
already
had
a
8-year-old
son--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--there
would
be
no
question
that
it
was
a
real
marriage.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
i
don't
think
that's--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--a
difficult
analysis.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
the
only
expectation,
justice
kennedy,
that
we
are
proposing
is
that
my
client...
and
aliens,
generally,
because
this
is
an
analysis
that
must
be
done
on
a
categorical
basis...
reasonably
expected
that
congress
wouldn't
change
the
consequences
of
their
reentries
far
in
the
past
without
doing
so
explicitly.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
in
1982,
justice
ginsburg,
my
client
reasonably
presumed
that
the
act
of
reentry,
while
itself
a
crime
and
while
itself
rendering
him
deportable,
wouldn't
categorically
preclude
him
from
seeking
relief
from
deportation
if,
at
a
future
date,
he
might
become
eligible
to
adjust
in
some
way,
either
through
suspension
of
deportation
by
having
been
here
for
7
years,
or
by
marrying
an
american
citizen,
or
by
having
a
reasonable
claim
for
asylum.
all
of
these
were
routes
to
stay,
despite
illegal
entry
or
reentry.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
the
implications
of
your--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--justice
scalia,
the
implication
of
your
argument
is
that
a
wrongdoer
has
no
reasonable
expectation
in
the
law
staying
constant.
but,
of
course,
both
the
hughes
aircraft
and
the
landgraf
decisions
are
cases
in
which
a
conduct
was
clearly
illegal
or
unlawful
at
the
time
it
was
done,
but,
nonetheless,
a
change
in
the
law
would
retroactively
change
the
implications
of
that
unlawful
conduct.
and
this
court,
in
both
those
cases,
held
that
it
was...
that
such
change
cannot
be
effected
retroactively.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
however,
the
parallel
in
st.
cyr
is
that
at
the
time
the
immigrant
in
st.
cyr
pled
guilty,
he
was
presumptively
deportable
as
a
result
of
having
pled
guilty
to
a
crime.
he
was
eligible
to
seek
discretionary
relief
from
deportation,
which
this
court
called
st.
cyr
decision.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
similarly,
here--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--it's
unclear
to
me
whether
or
not
the
st.
cyr
case
would
also
generalize
to
someone
who
simply
was
convicted
of
a
crime
at
that
date.
and
there's
a
debate
in
the
lower
courts
about
that.
but,
more
generally,
in
my
client's
context,
at
the
very
least
his
decision
to
stay
in
the
united
states
for
7
years,
and
thus
become
eligible
for
suspension
of
deportation,
and
then
not
to
leave
thereafter,
was,
itself,
a
very
similar
choice
to
that
of
the
alien
in
st.
cyr.
it's
a
conscious
decision
to
remain
here,
rather
than
to
leave.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
only
a
few
points
i
want
to
make.
the
first
is
that
illegal
reentrants'
reasonable
expectation
that
they
might
grow
into
relief,
as
mr....
the
chief
justice
said,
not
only
is
reasonable,
but
has
a
statutory
basis.
suspension
of
deportation
and
cancellation
of
removal,
by
their
very
terms,
are
only
available
to
aliens
who
were
illegally
present
in
the
united
states
for
the
relevant
time
period,
and,
therefore,
these
forms
of
relief
specifically
exist
to...
for
such
aliens.
that
people
have
a
reasonable
reliance
interest
in
unlawful
acts
over
time
is
also
demonstrated
by
such
doctrines
as
the
doctrine
of
adverse
possession,
statutes
of
limitations/laches,
et
cetera.
second,
justice
breyer,
your...
it
is
the
case
that
were
he
to
have
been...
have
left
after
the
enactment
of
this
act,
he
would
be
kept
out
for...
inadmissible
for
5
years.
that's
8
u.s.c.
1182(a)(6)(b).
because
he
had
reentered
the
country
within
5
years
of
his
1981
deportation,
he...
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
that
statute,
he
would
be
inadmissible
for
5
years
from...
even
if
he
were
to
releave
in
1996,
he
would
have
been
ineligible
to
reenter
for
5
years.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
the
former...
that
was
repealed--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--in
1996.
but,
yes--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--that
would
have...
as
part
of
iirira...
but
if
he
had
waited
til
iirira
took
effect,
then
it
would
have
been...
he
would
have
been
subject
to
this--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--provision.
the--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--thank
you,
your
honor.
