justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
if
the
rem
is
in
another
court
before
the
bankruptcy
begins?
what
if
the
res
is
within...
is
in
another
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
even...
even
if
property
is
in
the
custody
of
another
court
in
the
probate
proceeding
and
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
comes
later,
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
would
sweep
whatever
assets
are
before
the
probate
court
into
the
bankruptcy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
richland--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
seems
to
me
to
be
involved
here
is
what
is
not
uncommon
in
our
federal
system,
that
is,
two
proceedings,
both
dealing
with
the
same
or
closely
related
subject
matter.
it
is
not
infrequent
that
you
have
parallel
proceedings
in
federal
court
and
state
court,
and
then
the
one
that
gets
finished
first...
that
judgment
is
binding
on
the
other.
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
probate
proceeding
concluded
first
before
the
district
judge
reviewed
the
bankruptcy
judge's
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm...
i'm
assuming...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
this...
that
the
bankruptcy
court
makes
a
proposed
opinion.
it
doesn't
become
a
binding
opinion
until
it's
affirmed
by
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
it
isn't
a
core
matter.
i
think
you
lost
on
that
in
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
not
reviewed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would...
that
would
be
the...
if
you...
if
you're
correct
about
the
limits
of
the
probate
exception,
that
issue
would
be
open
for
review
by
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
maynard,
you
said
at
one
point
it's
not
necessary
for
you
to
decide
this,
but
there
is
vast
confusion
in
the
lower
courts
about
the
extent
of
the
probate
exception.
and
so
i
take
it
that
your...
what
you
began...
what
you
began
with
is...
i
wrote
them
down.
that's
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
addition
to
markham,
what
other
case
of
this
court
do
you
think
spells
out
the
proper
bounds?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
it?
the
probate
exception
is
court-created.
congress
passed
no
law
that
said
it.
congress
gave
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
in
certain
categories
of
cases
and
expected
them
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
since
our
jurisdiction
is
statutory
and
the
probate
exception
was
made
up
by
the
courts,
shouldn't
we
interpret
it
as
narrowly
as
possible,
perhaps
even
do
away
with
it
because
it
lacks
any
statutory
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
arguing
a
preclusion
question,
and
if
the
ninth
circuit
thought
it
had
jurisdiction,
it
could
have
tested
what
you
say
about
texas
law.
there's
no
finding
in
this
record
of
what
texas
law
is
other
than
what
you
have
just
told
us,
and
perhaps
you're
right
and
perhaps
you're
not.
but
the
ninth
circuit
said
the
federal
door
is
closed
to
this
probate
exception,
and
that's
what
we're
here
to
decide.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it...
it
may
be
that
there's
another
side
to
that
story.
for
example,
i
think
the
bankruptcy
court
was
heard
from
first.
arguably,
that's
binding
on
the
texas
court.
whether
the
bankruptcy
court
was
right
or
wrong,
it
would
get
full
faith
and
credit.
that's
one
argument.
another
is
perhaps
you
can
explain
to
me
how
this
all
started
because
i
thought
that
there
was
a
claim
made
against
her
in
the
bankruptcy
court
for
defamation.
then
the
claim
that
she
asserts
is
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
she
has
to
make
it
there
or
she'll
lose
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i...
i
didn't
understand
the
pleading
to
say
if
i
have
a
claim,
it
would
be
nondischargeable.
i
thought
he
made
a
claim.
he
made...
filed
a
claim
for
defamation
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
would
have
to
say
i
have
a
claim
because
the
bankruptcy
court
is
not
going
to
decide
a
hypothetical
if
he
has
a
claim.
he
has
to
at
least
assert
i
have
a
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
to
be
a
real
claim.
it
can't
be
if
i
have
a
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
are
suggesting
an
extraordinary
setup
with
a
state
court
being
able
to
preclude
other
courts
from
dealing
with
related,
not
identical
matters,
and
that's
just
not
the
way
our
system
works.
you
can
bring
duplicative
proceedings
in
different
courts.
one
will
finish
first
and
that
will
bind
the
others.
but
i...
i
never
heard
of
a
state
court
being
able
to
say,
because
we
are
a
probate
court,
that
you...
you
couldn't
bring
a
tort
case
someplace
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
definition
of
an
in
rem
judgment,
but
she's
suing
for
an
in
personam
judgment
an
individual,
not
an
estate,
just
for
a
plain
old
money
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
claim
of
petitioner
vickie
lynn
marshall
to
share
in
the
large
fortune
of
her
deceased
husband,
j.
howard
marshall.
petitioner
alleges
that
j.
howard
intended
to
provide
for
her
well-being
after
his
death
by
placing
in
trust
for
her
benefit
one-half
of
the
appreciation
of
his
assets
from
the
date
of
their
marriage
in
june
1994
until
the
date
of
his
death
in
august
1995.
vickie
centrally
asserts
that
j.
howard’s
son,
e.
pierce
marshall,
respondent
in
this
case
and
ultimate
beneficiary
of
j.
howard’s
estate
plan,
tortiously
impeded
her
receipt
of
the
precisely
described
gift
she
anticipated.
the
contest
between
vickie
and
pierce
played
out
on
two
fronts,
in
a
texas
probate
court
and
in
federal
bankruptcy
and
district
courts.
pierce
was
the
victor
in
the
state
probate
court;
vickie
prevailed
in
the
federal
trial-court
proceedings.
asserting
that
the
only
the
texas
probate
court
had
authority
to
deal
with
the
dispute,
pierce
invoked
the
so-called
probate
exception
to
the
exercise
of
federal-court
jurisdiction.
the
u.s.
district
court
rejected
that
plea,
but
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit
agreed
with
pierce
that
the
probate
exception
applied,
rendering
the
texas
probate
court
exclusively
competent
to
resolve
the
dispute.
we
reverse
that
determination.
our
opinion
discusses
two
limitations
on
the
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction,
the
so-called
domestic
relations
and
probate
exceptions.
neither
is
compelled
by
the
text
of
the
constitution
or
federal
statute.
both
are
judicially
created
doctrines
stemming,
in
large
measure,
from
misty
understandings
of
english
legal
history.
in
a
1992
decision,
ankenbrandt
v.
richards,
this
court
reigned
in
the
domestic-relations
exception,
confining
it
to
divorce,
alimony
and
child-custody
decrees
and
rejecting
more
expansive
interpretations.
earlier,
in
a
1946
decision,
malcolm
against
allen,
the
court
endeavored
similarly
to
contain
the
probate
exception.
that
decision
upheld
federal-court
jurisdiction
in
the
case
than
before
the
courts.
but
malcolm
caused
confusion
because
of
its
less
than
meticulously
crafted
language.
malcolm
stated
that
federal
jurisdiction,
otherwise
proper,
could
be
exercised
in
matters
relating
to
a
decedent’s
fortune,
so
long
as
the
federal
court
does
not
interfere
with
the
probate
proceedings.
some
lower
federal
courts,
including
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit,
read
the
words
“interfere
with”
expansively
to
block
federal
jurisdiction
over
a
range
of
matters
well
beyond
the
admission
of
a
will
to
probate
or
the
administration
of
a
decedent’s
estate.
we
hold
today
that
the
probate
exception
reserves
to
state
courts
the
probate
or
annulment
of
a
will
and
the
administration
of
a
decedent’s
estate.
it
also,
and
most
importantly,
precludes
federal
courts
from
disposing
of
property
that
is
in
the
custody
of
a
state
court.
but
that
is
the
sum
and
substance
of
it.
the
probate
exception
does
not
bar
federal
courts
from
adjudicating
matters
outside
those
confines
and
otherwise
within
federal
jurisdiction.
vickie
marshall’s
claim,
we
explain,
falls
entirely
outside
the
tight
bounds
of
the
probate
exception
and,
as
the
district
court
held,
qualifies
for
adjudication
in
federal
court.
while
we
reverse
the
9th
circuit’s
judgment,
we
note
issues
remaining
open
for
that
court’s
consideration
on
remand.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
