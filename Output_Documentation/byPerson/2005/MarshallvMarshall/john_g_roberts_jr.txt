chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
04-1544,
vickie
lynn
marshall
v.
e.
pierce
marshall.
mr.
richland.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
did
file
a
challenge
to
the
probate
of
the
will,
didn't
you,
in
texas?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
wasn't
the
ground
for
that
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
inter
vivos
trust
that
you
are
asserting
in
the
bankruptcy
court
proceeding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but...
but
this
case
involves
a
lot
more
than
convenience.
it
involves
a
substantial
amount
of
assets
that
is
either
going
to
pass
to
one
person
under
probate
or
is
not
going
to
be
available
for
passing
to
that
person
because
of
the
inter
vivos
gift.
that
seems
to
be
more
closely
related
to
the
core
probate
matters.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
except
if
it's
a
will...
will-specific.
in
other
words,
you...
it
seems
to
me
you're
in
for
a
penny
and
in
for
a
pound.
you
recognize
the
existence
of
this
exception
in
certain
cases,
and
then
you
argue
against
it
by
saying,
well,
congress
wrote
the
statutes
broadly.
the
latter
argument
disproves
your
first
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with...
with
new
dicta
of
our
own?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
maynard.
mr.
brunstad.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
isn't
that,
as
justice
breyer
prefaced
his
question,
an
issue
of
preclusion
rather
than,
as
you
frame
it,
an
issue
of
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
don't...
i
don't
see
how
the
interference
with
the
probate
court
that
you're
articulating
is
any
greater
than
the
interference
in
markham.
in
markham,
it
was
a
decision
by
the
federal
court
that
these
claimants
were
not
going
to
claim
under
the
will.
why
is...
isn't
that
even
greater
than
the
interference
you're
complaining
of?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
she's
not...
she's
not
even
going
after
the
assets
in
this
case.
she's
asserting
an
in
personam
claim
against
the
individual.
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the...
the
only
court
i've
heard
of
that
can
do
that
is
the
federal
bankruptcy
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
richland,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
in
04-1544,
marshall
versus
marshall.
