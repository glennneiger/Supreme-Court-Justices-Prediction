mr.
kent
l.
richland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case,
but
it
is
a
bankruptcy
case
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
has
made...
come
to
the
extraordinary
conclusion
that
the
federal
bankruptcy
court
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
chief
assets
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
that
asset,
a...
a
tort
cause
of
action,
was
to
be
the
main
source
of
the
payment
to
the
creditors.
and
the
ninth
circuit
came
to
this
conclusion
because
it
gave
a
very
broad
interpretation
of
the
so-called
probate
exception
to
federal
jurisdiction.
as
i
will
explain,
the
federal
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
statutes
are
incompatible
with
the
concept
of
having
adopted
a
probate
exception
to
federal
jurisdiction,
particularly
to
federal
bankruptcy
jurisdiction.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
no
exception
to
that.
the...
the
statute
itself
is
structured
in
such
a
way
that
its
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
depends
on
the
relationship
of
the
matter
to
the
bankruptcy
estate.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
question
is,
of
course,
that's
an
attack
on
a
probated
will,
i
believe,
and
i
think
that
this
court's
jurisprudence
also
supports
the
notion
that--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--well,
the...
the
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
statute
states
that--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--the
answer
is
yes,
it
does,
and
it
must
have
that
power
to
be
able
to
do
so
because
the
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
statute
states
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
in
rem
jurisdiction,
exclusive
in
rem
jurisdiction--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--over
all
assets
of
the--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--yes,
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
28
u.s.c.,
section
1334(e)
states
the
bankruptcy
court
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction,
in
rem
jurisdiction,
over
the
bankruptcy
estate,
and
that
has
been
interpreted
by
the
courts
as
meaning
that
it
has
paramount
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
the
normal
in
custodia
legis
doctrine
does
not
apply
where
it
is
a
bankruptcy
court
case.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
there
have
been
courts
that
have
held
that
with
respect--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--well,
it's
certainly
not--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--well,
it
certainly
is
not
necessary,
of
course,
to...
to...
for
us
to
prevail
in
this
case.
however,
i
think
it
is
an
important
principle
to
interpret
the...
the
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
statute,
look
at
the
language
of
that
statute,
and
determine
what
congress
intended
from
that.
and...
and
i
think
it
also
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
get
into,
implying
exceptions
into
that
statute.
but...
but
let
me
state
this.
obviously,
in
this
case
we
have
an
action,
the...
the
in
rem
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
over
the
chose
in
action,
that
is...
is
miles
away
from
the
probate
of...
of
a
will.
the
particular
cause
of
action
involved
here
was
an
interference
with
an
inter
vivos
gift.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
that
was
intended
to
be
a
gift
that
would
be
complete
during
the
lifetime
of
the
decedent.
that
fact
means
that
this
case
really
has
almost
nothing
to
do
with
probate
or
probate
jurisdiction.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
there
was
a
challenge
filed
to
the
probate
of
the
will
originally
by
the...
the
brother
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
and
eventually
yes,
our
client
did
join
that
some
years
later
after
it
was
first
filed.
so
that
would
have
been
an
alternative.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
no,
that
was
not
the
case,
your
honor.
the...
the
grounds
for
that
was
the
belief
that
there
had
been
undue
influence
with
respect
to
the
will.
but
the
inter
vivos
gift
claim...
a
tortious
interference
with
inter
vivos
gift
claim...
that
was
added
only
many
years
later
in
the
year
2000.
that
was
3
years,
3
and
a
half
years
after
that
same
action
was
pending
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
the
only
reason
it
was
raised
at
that
time
was
that
respondent
went
to
the
federal
court
and
said...
and
interposed
the
probate
exception
and
argued
at
that
time
there
is
no
jurisdiction
here.
therefore,
out
of
an
excess
of
caution,
our
client
went
to
the
texas
probate
court
and
said,
well,
i
will...
i
will
make
this...
this
claim
here.
in
fact,
once
there
was
success
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
bankruptcy
court
said,
now
i
have
made
a
determination
on
that
claim,
our
client
did
dismiss
claim
and
dismissed
all
affirmative
claims
with
respect
to
the
probate
estate.
i
think
the
important
thing
to
realize
here,
with
respect
to
both
this
particular
claim
and
with
respect
to
the
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
statute
in
particular,
is
that
the...
that
the
breadth
of
the...
what
that
statute
does
is,
it...
it
announces
that
rather
than
having
jurisdictional
preclusions,
there
will
be
preclusions
based
on
abstention.
it
has
broad
abstention
provisions
in
section
1334(c),
and
indeed
section
1334(c)(2),
which
is
the
mandatory
abstension--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--well,
of
course,
if
one
looks
at
1334(c)(2),
one
sees
that
congress
itself
contemplated
that
there
would
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
under
circumstances
where
there
was
no
diversity
jurisdiction
and
when
there
was
no
federal
question
jurisdiction.
so
it...
it
certainly
is
true
that
rolled
into
the
whole
notion
of
mandatory
abstention
is
the
possibility
that
the
bankruptcy
court
will
have
before
it
matters
over
which
there
would
be
no
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
excuse
me,
justice
scalia,
but
what
i
think
it
does
prove
is
that
when
congress
enacted
in
1978
the
rather
comprehensive
change
that
it
made
to
the
bankruptcy
statutes,
that
it
intended
to
exercise
as
broad
a
jurisdiction
as
possible
so
that
the
bankruptcy
courts
would
be
able
to
control
the
bankruptcy
estate
and
make
determinations
as
to
how
the
creditors
could
best
be
protected.
let
me...
let...
yes.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
to...
to
apply
very
broadly
according
to
its
terms.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
and,
of
course,
this
court
in...
first
in
lear
v.
armstrong
said,
yes,
this
applies
very
broadly.
however,
there
is
an
exception
and
the
exception
is
purely
the
probate
of
a
will...
the
probate
of
a
will
and
that
alone.
and
this
court
has
really
hewn
very
closely
to
that
very
narrow
limitation
since
that
point
in
time.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
i
do
think
that
it's
important,
however,
to
realize
that
if
one
examines
this
court's
probate
exception
jurisdiction
over
the
years,
it
has
consistently
determined
that
the...
the
narrowness
of
that
exception
must
be
confirmed,
and
as
late
as
the
markham
case,
this
court
has
held
that...
that
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
all
kinds
of
issues
with
respect
to
wills,
all
kinds
of
issues
with
respect
to
trusts.
certainly
this
court
has
said
that
it
can
determine
questions
such
as
how
to
interpret
the
provision
of
a
will.
it
has
even
held
that
federal
courts
can
determine
whether
a
will
is
invalid.
it
can
make
that
determination
if
the--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--you
are
absolutely
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
i'm
happy
to
do
that,
your
honor.
this
case
is
an
outlier.
i
believe
that
is
true.
this
case
is
so
far
from
the
potential
of
any
probate
exception
that,
although
i
felt
that
it
was
important
to
be
able
to
explicate
the...
the
principles
involved
here,
i--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--oh--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--it...
it
would
not.
that
is
all
that's
involved.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
i...
i
don't
believe--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--that
is...
that
is
incorrect,
justice
kennedy.
it
did
not
invalidate
the
inter
vivos
trust.
what
it
held
was
that
as
part
of
the
evidence
that
it
was
considering,
in
terms
of
the
intent,
the
donor's
intent,
that
one
portion
of
that
inter
vivos
trust,
an
amendment
to
it,
had
been
forged,
but
it
did
not
invalidate
it.
in
fact,
it...
it
expressly
held
that
the...
the
inter
vivos
trust
is
valid,
and
that
was
a
basis
for
its
conclusion
that,
indeed,
this
particular
claim
was
also
valid.
this
claim
was
a
cause
of
action
for
interference
with
an
inter
vivos
gift.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes.
why
not?
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
a...
a,
we
do
not
interpret
texas
law
as
so
providing.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
but...
but
assuming--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--assuming
that
they're
right
for
that...
by
their
interpretation,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it...
that
a...
a
state
court
cannot...
by
simply
assigning
matters
that
otherwise
would
be
heard
by
federal
courts
to
the
probate
court,
that
it
can,
in
effect,
shield
those--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--oh,
i
think
hess--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--said
it
over
and
over,
but
hess
v.
reynolds
from
1885,
which
says
that
merely
the
convenience
of
a...
a
state
court
to,
you
know,
assign
matters
to...
to
its
probate
court.
that
was
a
case
in
which
a
debt--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--but
in
fact,
chief
justice
roberts,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
nothing
passed
by
way
of
probate
in
this
case.
the...
there
were
no
assets
in
the
probate.
what
happened
here
was
that
all
of
the
assets...
and
the
record
shows
this,
and
i
don't
believe
it's...
that
there
is
any
dispute
here.
all
of
the
assets
had
passed
to
the
respondent
in
this
case
before
the
will
and
the
trust
were
actually
submitted
to
the
probate
court.
once
again,
this
is
a
tort
claim
and
it's
a
tort
claim
only
for
an
interference.
if
those
assets
had
never
gone
to
respondent
in
this
case,
there
would,
nevertheless,
still
be
a
good
tort
claim.
if,
for
example,
those
assets
had
been
passed
to
respondent's
child
or
to
another
brother,
the
interference
itself--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--excuse
me,
justice--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--justice
ginsburg,
you're
quite
correct
that
issues...
that...
that
the
principles
of
preclusion
ordinarily
would
deal
with
the
kinds
of
issues
here,
and...
and
we
think
that
that...
those...
that
should
be
what
governs
this
case.
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
correct
to
say
that
the
probate
court
judgment
preceded
that
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
bankruptcy
court
judgment
came
first.
a
year
later
the
probate
court
judgment
then--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--unless
it's
a
core
matter.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
and
here
we
claim
that
it
is
a
core
matter.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
if
it
isn't
a
core
matter,
then
in
any
event
the
district
court
here
held
that
there
was
no
preclusion,
and
it
held
it
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
that's
correct.
that
was
not
reviewed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
but
that
would
be
the...
the
appropriate
manner
of
review.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
it
certainly
would,
justice
ginsburg.
we
agree
with
that.
and
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
thank
you.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
breyer,
to
answer
your
question
about
whether
the
texas
court
had
all
of
the
material
before
it
that
was
before
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
answer
to
that
can
be
seen
at
page
45
of
the
appendix
where
the
district
court
judge
says
that
there
were
400
boxes
of
documents.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
they
did.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
they
did.
they
contained
the...
perhaps
the
most
key
documents,
which
were
the
billing
records
that
showed
that
that
trust
was
actually
drafted.
the
trust,
of
course,
never
saw
the
light
of
day,
but
those
billing
records
reflected
that.
and
none
of
that
was
in
front
of
the
texas
probate
court.
in
addition,
justice
breyer,
you
mentioned
that
there
were
a
number
of
other
instances
of
tortious
misconduct
that
were
found
by
justice
carter,
in
addition
to
the
forging
of
the...
of
the
irrevocability
point.
indeed,
justice
carter
found
that
there
were
massive
transfers
of
j.
howard's
assets
to
pierce
marshall
in
his
last
days,
and
those
asset
transfers
were
made
in
exchange
for
notes
that
were
payable
years
in
the
future.
this
was
after
j.
howard
had
been
diagnosed
with
terminal
cancer,
after
he
had
had
a
heart
attack.
annuities
were
used
to
pay
for
those
as
well.
so
that
he
was
essentially
stripped
of
all
of
his
assets
by
the
time
he
was
dead.
there
was...
there
were
no
assets
in
the
probate
estate
at
that
time.
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
refer
you
to
appendix
page
42
where
the...
the
district
court
indicates
that
both
a
proof
of
claim
and
an
adversary
complaint
were
first
filed
by
pierce
marshall
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
that
is,
indeed,
what
caused,
several
months
later,
the
compulsory
counterclaim
to
be
filed
in
a
response.
mr.
brunstad
indicated
that
what
happened
here
was
that
while
the
claim
was
pending
in
texas,
it
was
then
brought
to
the
bankruptcy
court
presumably
because
there
was
some
dissatisfaction
on
ms.
marshall's
part
as
to
how
the
texas
probate
court
was
going.
in
fact,
page
1
of
our
reply
brief
details
very
specifically
the
fact
that
the
first
time
that
the
tortious
interference
with
gift
claim
was
made
was
in
the
bankruptcy
court
as
the
compulsory
counterclaim.
and
i
would
just
conclude
by
stating
that
the
cause
of
action
that
was
at
issue
here
was
really
a
very
common
one.
it's
the...
not
in
and
of
itself,
but
it's
common
to
make
a
claim
against
the
estate
in
debt
or
that
a
gift
was
given,
and
that
may,
indeed,
diminish
the
estate
that
is
eventually
passed.
but
that
doesn't
invalidate
any
of
the
estate
planning
documents.
it
simply
means
that
something
that
might
otherwise
have
been
within
the
estate
was
not
included
in
the
estate.
that's
really
all
that
happened
here.
the
claim
was
for
tortious
interference
with
gift.
that,
indeed,
may
have
diminished
the
amount
or
may
not
have
since
j.
howard
was
actually
quite
an
active
man
at
the
time
that
he
made
this...
this
gift
or
intended
to
make
the
gift,
and
was
still
doing
business
deals.
he
may
have
increased
his...
his
assets
enormously
at
that
point
in
time.
but
in
any
event,
what
it
certainly
does
not
do
is,
it
does
not
invalidate
an
estate
plan.
it
does
not
invalidate
a
will,
and
it
certainly
didn't
invalidate
the
trust
or
the
will
in
this
case.
if
there
are
any
further
questions,
i'd
be
happy
to
answer
them.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
thank
you.
