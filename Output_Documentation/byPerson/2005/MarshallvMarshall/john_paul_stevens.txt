ms.
maynard,
it's
my
understanding
that
a
lot
of
this
law
developed
out
of
the
dicta
in
the
markham
case.
do
you
think
the
dicta
in
the
markham
case
was
an
accurate
description
of
the
prior
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
know
there
are
a
lot
of
scholars
who
think
that
markham
is
the
source
of
most
of
the
confusion,
and
so
that's
why
i
was
asking
whether
you
think
we
should...
to
clear
up,
which
you're
suggesting
we
should
do,
we
should
reexamine
some
of
that
dicta
or
we
should
just
stick
to
the
holding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it...
is
it
correct...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
follow
you...
that
they
determined
that
the
estate
plan
was
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
brunstad--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
two
questions?
first,
if
there
were
no
such
animal
as
the
probate
exception,
would
there
have
been
bankruptcy
court
jurisdiction
over
your
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your...
you
would
prevail
even
if
there
were
no
probate
exception
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
my...
my
second
question
is
i
noticed
you
quoted
from
a
minnesota
law
review
about
250
cases,
and
the...
your
opponent
pointed
out
that
the...
the
next
sentence
of
the
article
said
the
holdings
don't
support
the
generalization.
and
i
would
just
like
to
ask
you,
apart
from
the
markham
case,
what
is
the
case...
what
holding
of
a
case
lends
the
greatest
support
to
your
probate
exception
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
asking
you
to
rank
them.
i
don't
want
a
list
of
cases
that
have
a
lot
of
dicta
because
some
of
these
cases
went
off
on
laches,
some
went
off
a
lot
of
different
grounds
than...
than...
some
of
them
don't
even
mention
probate.
