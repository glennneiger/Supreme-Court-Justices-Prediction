ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
independent
principles
require
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
first,
the
probate
exception
to
federal
jurisdiction
is
a
will-specific
rule
and
it
does
not
apply
beyond
the
context
of
wills
to
other
types
of
will
substitutes
like
inter
vivos
trusts.
second,
even
with
respect
to
wills,
it
is
a
very
narrow
exception
that
is
no
bar
to
deciding
the
rights
to
a
decedent's
estate,
construing
a
will,
or
determining
the
testator's
intent.
there
are
only
three
things
under
this
court's
precedent
that
a
federal
court
cannot
do.
the
first
is
to
probate
a
will,
that
is,
to
determine
the
formal
key
requisites
of
the
validity
of
a
will;
second,
to
annul
an
already
probated
will;
and
three,
to
take
in
rem
jurisdiction
over
a
res
over
which
a
state
court
has
already
taken
in
rem
jurisdiction.
but
that
is
it,
and
none
of
those
are
applicable
here.
the
justifications
for
the
probate
exception
do
not
apply
to
will
substitutes.
the...
the
probate
exception
is
based
on
the
peculiar
nature
of
a
will,
that
is,
that
unlike
inter
vivos
trusts,
unlike
the
current
modern
will
substitutes,
a
will
is
not
valid...
it
has
no
legal
effect.
this
court's
opinions
have
said
that
on
several
occasions...
unless
it
is
probated.
therefore,
a
will
must
be
probated
even
if
there
is
no
dispute
about
its
validity
before
any
title
can
pass.
not
so
with
trusts.
in
fact,
that
is
the
whole
point
that
people
engage
in
the
modern
world
substitutes
is
to
avoid
the
necessity
to
go
to
the
probate
court
in
order
to
have
their
assets
passed
to
their
heirs.
the
second
ground
for
this
court's
probate
exception
is
the
historical
one
based
on
the
court's
understanding
of
the
limits
of
the
equity
courts
in
england.
whatever
the
merit
of
that
historical
analysis,
it
has
not
application
to
trusts,
which
have
always
been
the
problems
of
equity.
the
federal
government
has
a
strong
interest
in
the
court
not
expanding
the
federal
exception...
the...
the
probate
exception
to
federal
jurisdiction,
particularly
in
the
sweeping
manner
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
done.
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
tax
consequences
of
an
estate
planning
instrument,
such
as
a
trust,
to
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
trust
is
valid
or
invalid.
and
the
congress
has
provided
federal
jurisdiction
to
the
united
states
to
bring
its...
most
of
its
disputes
in
the
federal
court
system.
secondly,
more
generally,
congress
has
determined
what
types
of
disputes
should
be
in
the
federal
courts
and
has
passed
broad
statutes
providing
the
courts
with
federal
jurisdiction
that
the
courts
have
an
obligation
to
exercise,
if
it
exists.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
don't
believe
it
does,
and
perhaps
i'm...
i'm...
i
wasn't
making
clear
what
my
argument
is.
the
court
has
adopted
a
very
narrow
probate
exception
with
respect
to
the
probating
of
the
will
and
annulling
a
probated
will,
but
that
is
it.
and
that
analysis
was
based
on
a...
the
historical...
the
court's
view
of
the
historical
limits
of
courts
of
equity
and
therefore
was
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
diversity
statute.
under
the
logic
of
ankenbrandt,
one
can
assume...
one
may...
the
court
may
assume
that's
carried
forward.
but
certainly
that...
for
the
reasons
i've
said,
that
rationale,
those
justifications,
for
that
narrow
will
rule
do
not
apply
to
trusts,
which
have
always
been
the
province
of
equity,
and
especially
given
the
questionable
historical
underpinnings
of
the
exception,
even
the
narrow
exception
that
does
appear
to
exist,
there's
no
justification
for
expanding
that
beyond
its
current
confines.
as
this
court
recognized
in
ankenbrandt,
the
lower
courts
had
taken
the...
the
so-called
domestic
relations
exception
beyond
this
court's
very
narrow
limits,
and
this
court
brought...
brought
it
back
to
its
origins.
and...
and
the
federal
government
believes
that...
that
the
same
would
be
appropriate
here
with
respect
to
the
probate
exception.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
it
was
probably
not
a
very
precise
history,
justice
stevens.
i
do
think
one
can
read
markham,
however,
especially
if
one
reads
it
in
the
context
of
the
cases
it
cites
for
its
principles,
to
hold
what
we
are
saying
now,
which
is
that
federal
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
over
pure
probate
matters,
that
is,
no
jurisdiction
to
probate
a
will.
and
its
interference
language,
i
believe,
was
its
statement
of
the
in
rem
v.
in
rem
jurisdiction
principle,
which
in
fact
isn't
really
a
probate
jurisdiction
principle
at
all.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the...
the
united
states
hasn't
taken
a
position
on
the
broader
argument
about
whether
or
not
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if...
if
the
question
you're
asking
me
is
what
does
it
mean
to
probate
a
will--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the...
the
probate
of
a
will
requires
determining
that
it
has
the
appropriate
formal
prerequisites,
which
in
most
states
is
appropriate
number
of
signatures
that
the
testator
was
coherent,
competent
to
make
a
will
and
that
there
was
no
undue
influence.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
true,
yes,
that
there's
no
competing
will.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it's
conceivable
that
if
that
determination
went
to
a...
an
element
of,
for
example,
a
tort
claim
and
that
the
person
were
not...
were
not
seeking
to
take
under
the
will,
it
is
possible.
this
court's
precedent
doesn't
address
that
precise
question.
the
united
states
hasn't
taken
a
position
on
whether
or
not
bankruptcy
jurisdiction,
ala
the
logic
in
ankenbrandt,
encompasses
the
narrow
probate
exception
that
we
concede
exists
because
it's
not
necessary
to
decide
this
case.
the...
the
petitioner's
claim
is
far
beyond
anything
that
the
probate
exception
has
ever
applied
to.
the
respondent
suggests
that
states
have
an
overriding
interest
in
having
one
forum
resolve
all
probate-related
disputes.
this
court
has
repeatedly,
for
over
150
years,
rejected
that
exact
proposition...
justice
breyer,
payne
v.
hook,
hess
v.
reynolds,
mcclellan
v.
carland,
which
this
court
cited
last
term
in
exxon
mobil...
and
it
was
the
basis
of
markham's
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
that
the
federal
jurisdiction
is
not
determined
by
the
scope
and
extent
of
the
state's
decisions
with
respect
to
where
to
send
its
own
citizens
with
respect
to
disputes
that
don't
otherwise
have
a
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction.
the
only
place
in
this--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that's
what
the
united
states
believes
the
limit
of
the
exception
is,
and
the...
let
me
be
clear.
the
united
states
has
a
strong
interest
in
having
this
court
clarify
the
exception.
that
is
where
the
confusion
lies
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
where
the
united
states
feels
like
its
interests
are
at
risk.
so
although
the
petitioner's
claim
is
well
outside
the
exception,
the
united
states'
interests
lie
in
having
the
court
clear
up
the
confusion
and
reject
the
sweeping
and
expansive
view
of
the
probate
exception
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
announced.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i...
i
think
the...
waterman
has
a...
has
a
good
summary
of
the...
of
the
limits.
i
think
even
the
two
cases
on
which
the
respondent
principally
rely,
sutton
and
o'callaghan,
lay
out
the
proper
scope
of
the
rule.
those...
both
of
those
cases
involved
a
claim
that
depended
on
having
a
will
that
had
been
probated
declared
invalid,
and
that
is
within
the
narrow
confines
of
the
exception.
but
it
is
a
will-specific
rule.
the...
and,
justice
stevens,
back
to
your
question.
the
one
thing
about
markham
is
that
there's
no
general
interference
principle,
and
that's
where
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
would...
i
would...
you
can...
it
would
be
helpful
to...
to
clarify
what
the
court
meant
in
markham.
i
think
the
holding
in
markham
is
correct.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
it
will
probably
be
necessary,
to...
to
rule
on
the
case,
to
make
some
holding
about
what
the
scope
of
the
exception
is,
your
honor.
and
the...
the...
but,
justice
stevens,
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
court
certainly
could
resolve
it
that
way,
your
honor.
but,
justice
stevens,
the...
the...
markham,
i
do
think,
makes
clear
what
interference
is
and
is
not
by
its
holding.
and
on
page
494
of
markham,
it
says,
where
the
final
judgment
does
not
undertake
to
interfere
with
the
state
court's
possession,
save
to
the
extent
that
the
state
court
is
bound
by
the
judgment
to
recognize
the
right
adjudicated
by
the
federal
court.
so
that
is
not
the
type
of
interference
that
runs
afoul
of
the
rule.
