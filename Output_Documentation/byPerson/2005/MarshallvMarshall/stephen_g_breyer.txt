justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
like
this...
apparently
you
like
this
argument,
although
you
say
you're
miles
away
from
probate.
well,
if
you
want
to
get
into
that
argument,
i
guess
the
strongest
argument
against
keeping
it...
for
keeping
it
is
bankruptcy
jurisdictional
statutes
shouldn't
be
interpreted
differently
than
diversity
jurisdiction
or
any
other
statute,
and
markham
at
least
recognizes
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
probate
exception
and
that
congress
implicitly
adopted
it,
just
as
they
did
the
domestic
relations
exception.
therefore,
if
we
are
going
to
find
for
you
on
this
ground,
we'd
have
to
go
back
and
overrule
that
case
and
a
lot
of
other
water
that's
flowed
over...
under
the
bridge
or
wherever
the
water
flows.
[laughter]
and
we
ought
to
take
what's
given
as
given,
whatever
the
true
meaning
of
ecclesiastical
courts
having
jurisdiction
over
certain
probate
matters
or
not
in
the
18th
century.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
what
you're
going
to
hear
in
5-10
minutes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
might
as
well
deal
with
it
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
the
inter
vivos...
a...
a
claim
for
a...
the
texas
tort
of
interference
with
inter
vivos
gift,
according
to
texas
law,
must
be
brought
at
the
time
of
the
probate
proceeding.
and
for
that
reason,
it
is
bound
up
with
probate,
and
for
that
reason,
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
let's
suppose
you're--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
they're
right
about
their
interpretation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
strongest
case
for
you
on
that
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
said
this
court
has
repeatedly
said.
so
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
this
is
all...
this
has
nothing...
i
mean,
i...
you
have
the
total
differently...
different
understanding
than
i
do
of
this
case,
and
i
did
read
judge
carter's
opinion.
i
thought
that
case
simply
held
that
because
your
clients
had
interfered
with
an
effort
by
j.
howard
to
give
quite
a
few
millions
of
dollars
to
vickie
marshall...
because
of
that
interference,
they
had
committed
the
tort
of
inter
vivos
interference
with
a
gift,
and
they
had
to
pay
damages.
now,
they
said
a
lot
of
things
by
way
of
what
the
evidence
was.
indeed,
they
did
say,
as
you
point
out,
that
your
clients
forged
three
pages
of
the
will.
but
that
was
simply
evidence
of
their
bad
intent,
and
it
did
not
invalidate
anything
in
the
probate
proceeding,
as
i
read
it.
now,
what
have
i
said
that's
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
interested
in
what
he
said.
i'm
interested
in
what
judge
carter
said--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is...
and
what
is
it
that
judge
carter
did
that
was
wrong
in
this
respect?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that...
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
matter
of
preemption,
but...
but...
or
not
preemption
but,
you
know,
res
judicata.
but
just
out
of
curiosity
or...
because
i
think
it
is
relevant,
did
the
texas
probate
court
have
in
front
of
it
the
documents
among
the
lawyers
that
the
district
judge,
judge
carter,
relied
upon
in
showing
that
there
was
an
intent
to
create
the
catchall
trust?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
had
all
those
documents.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
that
is
to
say,
what
the
finding
is,
is
that
there
was
a
different
matter,
a
catchall
trust,
and
he
told
the
lawyers,
go
draw
it
up
so
i
can
give
gifts
to
her,
the
increase
in
the
value
of
my
property
during
the
13
months
we're
married,
do
it,
and
they
never
did
it.
now,
that
seems
to
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
grat
trust
or
with
the
will.
it
just
happens
that
those
are
evidentiary,
what
went
on
there,
of
what
likely
happened
with
the
catchall
trust.
so
i
don't
see
why
those
are
necessary.
i
don't
see
why
they're
more
than
evidentiary,
and
i
don't
see
whether
or
not
those
are
barred,
those
particular
facts
have
anything
to
do
with
this,
as
far
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned.
now,
explain
to
me
why
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
just
one
of
the
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
among
other
things
that
went
on
were
they
hired
private
detectives
to
go
after
vickie
from
the
bed.
i
mean,
you've
read
that
opinion
and
they're
like
about
30
things
in
there.
and
i
grant
you
that
one
of
those
things
is
the
fact
that
three
pages
of
the
living
trust,
according
to
the
judge,
were
created
after
the
event
of
that
trust
and
slipped
in
without
his
knowledge.
i
mean,
it's
quite
a
story.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
so
i...
but
as
i
read
it,
there
were
many,
many,
many
things
involved
here,
and
this
is
just
one
of
them.
so
how
can
texas
say
that
you
have
to
prove
this
particular
one
as...
as
opposed
to
proving
a
lot
of
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
they're
going
to
impose
a
constructive
trust,
are
they?
all...
all
they're
going
to
say
is
pay
her
the
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
going
to
say
it
because
they
make
a
finding
that
through
a
whole
variety
of
various
devices,
all
of
which
were
listed,
that
j.
howard,
who
wanted
to
give
her
money
through
something
called
the
catchall
trust
was
prevented
in
about
15
ways.
and
even
if
you're
right
that
there's
a
texas
finding
that
those
three
pages
weren't
slipped
in,
well,
how
do
we
know?
maybe
it
was
a
valid
grat
trust,
but
if
only
they
hadn't
tried
to
isolate
j.
howard
from
contact
with
her,
j.
howard
would
have
figured
out
what
had
happened
before
he
died
and
he
would
have
told
his
lawyers,
hey,
cut
this
out.
do
what
i
want.
revoke
it.
but
all
that
is
just
hypothetical.
i'm
just
using
that
to
show
you
why
i
think
this
is
evidentiary
not
a
matter
of
what
the
elements
of
the
crime
are...
or
the
elements
of
the
tort
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
cite
on
that
that
i...
that
i
need
for--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
saying
you
can't
bring
an
inter
vivos
trust...
an
inter
vivos...
interference
with
an
inter
vivos
gift
action
in
texas
unless
you
show
that
a
will,
for
example,
is
invalid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
the
way,
in
texas
if
you
have
to
go
through
all
this
probate
stuff
and
everything,
and
they
want
to
claim
15
years
ago
my
mother
gave
a
ring
to
my
cousin
who
stole
it,
is
that
precluded
to
bring
that
tort
action
when
the
person
who,
you
know,
was
supposed
to
get
it
finds
out
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so,
in
other
words,
if
it...
when
the
guy
is
2
years...
15
years
old,
he
gives
a
ring
to
somebody,
and
now
he
dies
at
age
93,
and
when
they
find
out
about
that
incomplete
gift
at
age
15,
nobody
can
bring
a
lawsuit
anymore.
you
have
to
go
to
the
probate
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
did
those
documents...
did
those
boxes
contain
the
key
documents--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--about
the
catchall
trust?
