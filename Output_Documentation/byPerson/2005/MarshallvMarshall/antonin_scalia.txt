justice
antonin
scalia
any
exception
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if...
if
the
contention
in
the...
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
is
that
the
will
which
has
been
probated
by
the
state
probate
court
is,
in
fact,
not
the
true
will
and
that
under
the
true
will,
the
bankruptcy
estate
would
get
money,
you
think
the
bankruptcy
court
would...
would
have
jurisdiction
to
probate
the
will.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
well,
i'm
willing
to...
to
move
it
back.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
even
harder
for
you.
but
let's
assume
that
the
will
is
in
probate
but
has
not
yet
been
probated.
do
you
think
the
bankruptcy
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
which
will
is
the
true
will?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
to
stand
on
this
position,
mr.
richland,
or
do
you
have
a
lesser
position--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that...
that
might
cause
you
to
win?
because--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
diversity
jurisdiction,
that
congress
contemplated
that
there
would
be
diversity
jurisdiction
where
there
was
no
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
and
no
federal
question
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
what
that
proves.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
just
saying
no
more
so
than...
than
when
congress
enacted
diversity
jurisdiction.
it
intended
it
to
apply,
you
know,
uniformly.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
look
moderate.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
no
jurisdiction
to
probate
a
will?
could...
could...
does
that
exclude
the
possibility
of
a
bankruptcy
court
deciding
for
itself
where
there
are
contested
wills
that
in
its
in
view
the...
the
right...
the
valid
will
is
a
certain
one
and
that,
therefore,
the
bankruptcy
estate
includes
this
fund
or
doesn't
include
this
fund?
is
that
probating
the
will?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that
isn't
probating
a
will,
the
exception
for
probating
a
will
doesn't...
doesn't
amount
to
a
hill
of
beans,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
that
this
is...
that
this
is
the...
the
last
will
and
testament
and
that
there
is
not
some
other
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
can...
can
the
bankruptcy
court
determine
that,
that
the...
that
the
proper
will
and
testament
of
this
decedent
is
this
one?
we're
not
probating
it.
no,
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
pretend
to
probate
it.
we're
just
saying
that
this
happens
to
be
the
true
will
and
testament.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
could
just
say
whatever
its
scope
is
it
ain't
this.
i
mean,
couldn't
we
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
isn't
probated.
that's...
it
is,
indeed,
a
will
substitute.
the
whole
purpose
of
doing
it
is
to
avoid
probate.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
an
estate
plan
or
a
will?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you...
you...
you're
stretching
the
probate
concept
from
determining
whether
the
will
is
valid
or
invalid
and
who
inherits
under
the
will
to
also
determining
what
goes
into
the
probate
estate,
that
is,
the
insurance
policies,
the
trust,
and
so
forth.
that
to
me
is...
is
something
quite
different
from
probating
a
will.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
but
that's
res
judicata.
i
mean,
that...
that
isn't
necessarily
a...
an
application
of...
of
any
probate
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that,
but
that
case
doesn't
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
case
do
you
have
that
says
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
jurisdiction
to
say
something
does
not
mean
that
if...
if
some
other
court
says
the
same
thing
first,
you
won't
be
bound
by
that.
