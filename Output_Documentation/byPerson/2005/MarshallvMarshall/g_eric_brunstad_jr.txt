mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
probate
exception
exists
precisely
to
prevent
what
happened
in
this
case,
a
federal
court
enjoining
ongoing
probate
proceedings
in
the
middle
of
a
probate
trial,
a
federal
court
determining
that
the
decedent's
estate
plan
was
invalid,
a
federal
court's
reallocation
through
a
damage
claim
of
the
decedent's
assets,
contrary
to
the
value
of
the
estate
plan,
a
federal
court's
creation
of
a
novel
cause
of
action--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--correct,
justice
stevens.
at
petition
appendix
123
to
126,
the
district
court
determined
that
the...
that
j.
howard's
living
trust
was
a
forgery,
that
there
were
pages
that
were
substituted--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
the
answer
to
your
question,
i
think,
depends
upon
the
fact
that
opposing
counsel
has
studiously
avoided
actually
reviewing
what
his
claim
is.
i
think
we
have
to
focus
on
the...
her
exact
claim.
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
she
did
not
prevail--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
judge...
judge
carter
understood
quite
clearly
that
in
order
for
her
claim
to
proceed
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
had
to
invalidate
her
living
trust.
and
let
me
explain
why
that
was
so.
that
was
so
because
her
claim
is
that
j.
howard
intended
to
give
her
a
catchall
trust.
the
argument
is
that
pierce
blocked
the
catchall
trust
from
being
funded
by
rendering
the
living
trust
irrevocable
in
july
of
1994.
judge
carter
found
that
the
catchall
trust
was
drafted
in
december
of
1994.
she
can
only
have
a
claim...
now,
all
of
j.
howard's
assets
were
in
the
living
trust.
she
can
only
have
a
claim...
the
catchall
trust
could
only
have
been
funded
or
prevented
from
being
funded
if
the
living
trust
was,
in
fact,
validly
rendered
irrevocable.
to
prevent...
to...
to
counter
that,
she
says,
no,
the
living
trust
was
invalid.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
she
can
have
no
claim
unless
the
living
trust
is
rendered
invalid.
judge
carter
understood
that
and
he
expressly
concluded
that
it
was
a
forgery.
now--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
law,
she
cannot
have
her
claim
because
the
two
cases
we
rely
on,
neill
v.
yett
and
thompson
v.
deloitte,
the
two
texas
cases,
establish
as
a
predicate
to
any
tortious
interference
claim,
she
must
demonstrate
that
the
estate
plan,
the
living
trust,
was
invalid
as
a
matter
of
texas
law.
and
that
is
exclusively
under
texas
law
for
the
texas
probate
court
to
decide.
now--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--because,
justice
souter,
under
texas
law
when
the...
the
probate
court
determines
the
validity
of
an
estate
plan,
it
forecloses,
as
a
matter
of
law,
all
expectancies
contrary
to
those
that
are
part
of
the
estate
plan.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
living
trust.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
souter,
and
the
reason
why
is
because
her
cause
of
action
is
a
state
law
cause
of
action,
and
under
texas
law,
putting
aside
the
fact
that
no
texas
court
has
ever
recognized
a
cause
of
action
for
tortious
interference--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--right.
putting
that
aside,
under
texas
law...
and
the
deloitte
case
and
the
neill
v.
yett
case
conclusively
established
this,
and
there's
no
contrary
decisions
in
texas...
that
once
the
probate
court
determines
an
estate
plan
is
valid,
it
conclusively
determines
the
universe
of
persons
with
legitimate
expectancies.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
texas
courts
have
conveniently
described
for
us
justice...
justice
souter--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
exactly
so,
justice
souter.
and
in
the
thompson
case
itself,
the...
the
texas
court
says,
when
the
probate
court
admitted
the
1989
will
to
probate,
it
necessarily
found
that
mr.
thompson
signed
the
will
with
testamentary
capacity
and
that
it
reflected
his
intent,
was
not
the
result
of
coercion
or
under
influence,
and
was
valid.
and
the
court
continued,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
final
probate
court
judgment
bars
any
claim
that
appellees
tortiously
interfered
with
any--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
breyer.
everything
that
the
district
court
had
and
more
was
examined,
adjudicated
in
the
5-and-a-half-month
jury
trial
in
the
texas
probate
court
exhaustively.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
chief
justice
roberts,
the
probate
exception
has
always
been
jurisdictional,
and
the
reason
why
it
can't
be
subsumed
by
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel...
we
believe
we
win
on
those
grounds,
but
the
reason
why
the
probate
exception
can't
be
subsumed
within
those
doctrines
is
because
it
applies
even
before
you
have
a
state
court
judgment.
it
prevents
a
federal
court
from
determining
an
estate
plan
from
being
invalidated--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg,
the
probate
exception,
like
the
domestic
relations
exception,
is
best
conceived
as
a
presumption
that
when
congress
establishes
a
font
of
federal
jurisdiction,
it
does
not
intend
that
jurisdiction
to
be
extended
to
interfere
with
probate
proceedings.
that
is
properly
a
jurisdictional
doctrine
in
this
case
because
it
is
never
appropriate
for
a
bankruptcy
court
to
invalidate
or
validate
a
will
and...
or
an
estate
plan.
and
that
is
a
necessary
element
of
vickie's
claim.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
no.
here
we
have...
when
i
say
estate
plan,
i
mean
the
living
trust
and
the
will
operating
together.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
living
trust
here
did
two
things
that
a
will
does.
it
provided
for
the
succession
of
j.
howard's
property
upon
his
death,
and
it
provided
for
the
payment
of
his
last...
last
illness
expenses
and
his...
his
debts.
it
is
quintessentially
a
will
substitute
in
the
sense
that
it
also
provides
for
the
succession
of
his
property.
in
this
case--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
the
will
and
the...
the
living
trust
acted
together.
the
probate
court
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
both
of
them
and
the
challenges
to
them.
vickie
challenged
the
living
trust,
even
before
j.
howard
died.
those
proceedings
continued
on
in
the
probate
court,
and--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--because,
justice
kennedy,
again,
the
critical
element
of
her
cause
of
action
is
the
invalidity
of
the
trust
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
law.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
certainly,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
texas
has
the
right
to
prescribe
the
elements
of
its
own
causes
of
action,
and
under
texas
law,
her
cause
of
action
depends
upon
two
critical
things,
a
legitimate
expectancy
j.
howard
intended
to
do
this
for
her,
and
the
second,
tortious
conduct
of
some
kind.
her
claim...
she
tries
to
meet
those
two
critical
elements
by
showing
two
things.
one,
that
j.
howard
intended
to
give
me
this...
this
gift
in
the
form
of
this...
this
trust,
and
that
it
was
tortiously
interfered
with
because
the
living
trust
was
rendered
irrevocable.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
it's--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--of
course,
your
honor--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
of
course,
as
an
aside,
we
went
to
great
pains
in
the
ninth
circuit
to
demonstrate
why
all
those
findings
were
clearly
erroneous
and
not
based
on
the
evidence.
but
assuming
them
to
be
so,
which
we
dispute,
again,
looking
at
her
claim,
that
is
the
critical
element
of
her
claim.
if,
in
fact,
there...
if,
in
fact,
the
living
trust
was
made
revocable,
then
at
any
point
in
time,
he
could
have
funded,
if...
if
he
had
it
as
revocable
until
his
death,
he
could
have
funded
her
gift
that
she
alleges
and
she
would
have
no
damage
claim.
it
is
because
of
the
trust
becoming
irrevocable
that
he
was
prevented
from
doing
it.
that
is
her
claim.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
souter,
as
a
matter
of
texas
law,
she
cannot
establish
a
legitimate
expectancy.
again,
once
the
probate
court...
and
the
probate
court
alone
has
the
right
to
determine
the
validity
of
an
estate
plan.
once
the
probate
court
has
determined
that
as
a
matter
of
texas
law,
all
claims
about
expectancies
contrary
to
those
provided
in
the...
in
the
plan
are
foreclosed.
that's
the
thompson
case
and
the
neill
case.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
ginsburg,
preclusion
will
also
not
work.
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
will
also
not
work
because
the
parties
in
the
federal
proceeding
are
merely
a
subset
of
the
parties
in
the
probate
court.
the
probate
court's
judgment
is
unique
because
it
has
a
binding-against-the-world
effect.
federal
courts
cannot
pull
chunks
of
the
critical
issues
into
the
federal
courts
because
doing
so
creates
an
inconsistency
of
judgments
potentially.
where
the
federal
court
only
has
part
of
the
parties
before
it,
the
federal
court
has
all...
the
probate
court
has
all
the
parties
before
it.
the
probate
court's
judgment
is
binding
against
the
world--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
the
claim
was
not
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
the
action
which
was...
that
pierce
commenced
in
the...
in
the
bankruptcy
court
was
merely
to
ask
the
bankruptcy
court
to
decide
that
if
he
had
a
debt
against...
if
he
had
a
claim
against
her
she
owed
him
money,
it
would
be
nondischargeable
in
bankruptcy.
she
then
used
that
opportunity
to
pursue
this
tortious
interference
claim
against
pierce
that
she
was
already
pursuing
in
the
probate
court.
so
because
there
was
a
prior
pending
proceeding
where
she
had
made
the
claim--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg,
pierce
did
not
ask
the
bankruptcy
court
to
decide
the
claim.
he
only...
he
only
asked
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
decide
whether
it
was
nondischargeable
or
not.
but
even
so...
even
so,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
bankruptcy
judges
do
that,
justice
ginsburg.
they
decide
only
the
nondischargeability
aspect
of
claims
rather
than
the
claims
themselves.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
ginsburg,
because
the
nondischargeability
jurisdiction
in
bankruptcy
is
unique.
you
allow
the
claim
to
be
determined
in
a
proper
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
and
then
the
bankruptcy
court
decides
whether
it's
nondischargeable
or
not.
that's
how
it
should
proceed
particularly
where,
as
here,
her
claim
requires,
as...
in
order
for
it
to...
to
be
valid,
to
determine
the
validity
or
nonvalidity
of
j.
howard's
estate
plan.
now,
the
united
states--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
chief
justice
roberts.
you
can
readily
divide
the
court's
precedents
into
categories,
those
where
there
was
impermissible
interference
and
therefore
no
jurisdiction,
and
those
where
there
isn't.
on
the
impermissible
interference
side,
you
have
a
case
like
a
federal
court
cannot
determine
the
validity
of
an
estate
plan,
armstrong,
gaines
v.
chew.
a
federal...
a
federal
court
cannot
determine--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--in
sutton--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
the
probate
exception
protects
the
integrity
of
the
succession
process.
if
the
documents
you're
looking
at
deal
with
the
succession
of
the
property,
as
the
living
trust
and
will
do
in
this
case,
it
is
encompassed
within
the
probate
exception
in
sutton--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--correct.
correct,
justice
souter.
but
here
the
succession
was
determined
under
the
living
trust,
and
in
sutton
v.
english,
that's
exactly
the
same
scenario.
moses
hubbard
left
a--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--because
the
joint...
where
you
have
the
equivalent
of
tenancies
in
the
entirety,
i'd
say
that's
a
separate
issue.
here,
however,
the
living
trust
performed
all
the
functions
of
a
traditional
will,
unlike
a
joint
bank
account.
in
the
sutton
case,
you
had
both
a
will
and
a
trust,
just
like
in
this
case.
there,
moses
hubbard
left
a
will
and
a
trust.
mary
jane
hubbard
enjoyed
the
benefits
of
the
trust
for
her
life.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
not
quite
the
same,
justice
souter.
not
quite
the
same.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
in
sutton
v.
english,
there
was
both
a
will
and
a
trust,
exactly
the
same
as
here.
the
plaintiffs
were
just
going
after
the
property.
we
just
want
the
assets.
we're
saying
we're
not
touching
the
trust
and
the
will.
this
court
held...
this
court
held,
wait
a
minute.
only
the
texas
probate
courts
may
determine
whether
these
instruments
are
valid
or
not.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
she
is,
but
that's
exactly
the
same
as
broderick's
will,
chief
justice
roberts,
an
in
personam
claim
against
the
beneficiaries
of
the
allegedly
invalid
estate
plan
to
impose
a
constructive
trust
on
them
to
get
the
money.
no
matter
how
you
dice
it
or
splice
it
in
this
case,
she
is
doing
an
end
run
around
the
probate
proceeding.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
why
are
they
going
to
say
pay
her
the
money?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
what's
not
evidentiary,
justice
breyer,
is
the
fact
that
in
order
to
prove
a
legitimate
expectancy,
she
must
establish
that
the
validated
estate
plan
is
in
fact
invalid.
and
under
texas
law,
that
can
only
be
done
in
the
probate
court.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
in
our
brief
we
cite
to
many,
many
cases,
your
honor.
i
would...
i
would
specifically
refer
you
to--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
those
are
the
neill
v.
yett
and
the
thompson...
thompson
v.
deloitte
cases,
which
i
was
reading
to
before.
and
the
court
said
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
final
probate
court
judgment
bars
any
claim
that
appellees
tortiously
interfered
with
any
inheritance
expectancy
because,
in
light
of
the
final
invalid
probate
court
judgment,
appellant
has--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
it
is
not
res
judicata
for
the
following
reason.
not
only
may
a
federal
court
not
determine
the
validity
or
invalidity
after
the
probate
court,
it
may
no
do
so
before
the
probate
court
has
had
a
chance--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that
case
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
cases...
there
is
no
specific
case
where
someone
has
tried
to
litigate
a
tortious
interference
claim
in
federal
court
before
the
probate
court
has
had...
has
had
its
say.
under
texas
law,
however,
because
of
the
preclusive
effect
of
that
determination,
vickie
would
be
able
to
come
to
the
probate
court
and
say,
look,
j.
howard
intended
to
give
me
this.
it's
a
finding
of
intent.
that's
preclusive
on
the
probate
court.
the
probate
court
would
be
perhaps
prohibited
from
saying,
oh,
i
can't
determine
under...
that
the
valid
estate
plan
gives
the
intent
to
somebody
else.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
problem,
though,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
probate
court
is
supposed
to
make
that
finding
in
a
judgment
good
against
the
world.
but
all
of
a
sudden,
part
of
the
world
who
has
done
an
end
run
around
the
probate
proceeding
has
now
gone
to
some
other
court
for
a
critical
determination
of
fact
that
the
probate
court
must
decide
and
always
must
decide
in
determining
the
validity
of
an
estate--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--just
as
a
federal
bankruptcy
court
is
in
rem
and
executes
and
enters
some
judgments
good
against
the
world
with
respect
to
some
issues,
a
probate
court
does
the
same
thing.
you
have
exactly
the
same
reason
why
the
probate
court
does
it
as
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
in
tilt
v.
kelsey,
for
example,
that
the
state
has
a
sovereign
interest
in
deciding
the
scope
of
its
probate
procedure
that
the
state
may,
this
court
said
in
broderick's
will,
provide
for
the
probate
court
to
enter
a
judgment
good
against
the
world,
whether
the
person
was
a
party
to
the
proceeding
or
not.
if
a...
if
a
federal
court
can
predetermine--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
in
a
race
to
judgment,
your
honor,
if
the
federal
court
gets
to
decide
this
critical
issue
of
intent
before
the
probate
court,
it
preempts
the
probate
court
from
doing
its
core
probate
function
of
validating
or
invalidating
an
estate
plan.
that
would
render
our
probate
system
unworkable.
that
is
why--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--this
is
a
jurisdictional
doctrine.
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
argue
no,
justice
stevens,
because
as
we
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit,
there
was
not
even
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
because
the
other
side
never
responded
to
our
argument
that
the
outcome
of
this
case
would
not
result
in
any
money
going
to
creditors
of
her
estate.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
our
argument.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
address
that
ground,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
the
sutton
case
is
the
closest.
the
next
closest
is
broderick's
will.
sutton
again
involved
both
a
trust
and
a
will
and
was
a
construction
of
texas
law,
which
we
say
the
court
has
already
decided
in
sutton,
and
texas
law,
which
is
undisputed,
has
the
effects
which
we
say
it
has
in
the
brief.
they
did
not
contest,
justice
ginsburg,
our
construction
or
interpretation
of
texas
law.
i
think
also
that
the
court's
decisions
in
tarver
and
fouvergne
and
also
ellis
and
o'callaghan--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
stevens,
i
think
that
it's...
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
could
give
you
a
thumbnail
sketch
breaking
down,
what
i
was
trying
to
do
earlier,
between
those
where
there's
impermissible
interference
and
those
where
there's
not
impermissible
interference.
the
united
states'
characterization
i
think
is
incorrect.
for
example,
again,
this
court
has
determined
there's
no
jurisdiction
for
a
federal
court
to
determine
the
validity
of
an
instrument.
that's
the
first
case
in
armstrong
v.
lear
and
also
gaines
v.
chew.
also,
this
court
has
determined
there's
no
federal
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
invalidity
of
an
estate
plan.
that's
tarver,
fouvergne,
and
o'callaghan,
broderick's
will,
sutton,
and
ellis.
this
court
has
determined
that
federal
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
administer
the
probate
estate.
that's
byers
v.
mcauley.
this
court
has
determined
that
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction
to
take
possession
of
the
assets
in
the
probate
court.
that
is
also
broderick's
will.
i'm
sorry.
that
is
byers
v.
mcauley.
this
court
has
determined
one
may
not
impose
a
constructive
trust
on
the
beneficiaries
as,
in
essence,
a
way
to
get
property
to
them.
that's
broderick's
will
and
sutton.
this
court
has
determined
there's
no
jurisdiction
to
recover
property
from
the
beneficiary
because
of
an
alleged
invalidity
of
a
will.
that's...
that's
the
ellis
case.
this
court
has
determined
there's
no
jurisdiction
for
the
federal
court
to
direct
an
accounting
from
the
administrator.
that's
the
waterman
case.
this
court
has
determined
there's
no
jurisdiction
to
interfere
with
the
state
court's
possession
of
the
assets,
again
waterman,
williams,
yonley,
and
borer.
now,
no
jurisdiction.
it's
always
been
a
jurisdictional
doctrine.
and
for
the
same
reasons
this
court
refused
to
recharacterize
the...
the
domestic
relations
exception
as
a
abstention
doctrine,
the
court
should
also
decline
to
do
so
here
under
the
probate
exception.
now,
the
other
side
of
the
schema
is
when
is
it
permissible
for
a
federal
court
to
undertake
a
probate-related
matter.
well,
if
the
state
allows
the
claim,
particular
claim,
to
be
brought
outside
its
exclusive
probate
system,
then
federal
courts
may
entertain
jurisdiction
as
well.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
breyer,
all
claims
of
incomplete
gift,
which
vickie's
claim
is
here,
compete
with
an
estate
plan.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
if
in
fact
the
ring
passed
under
his
valid
estate
plan,
yes.
because
the
ring
passed
under
the
valid
estate
plan,
you
have
to
overturn
the
estate
plan
before
you
say
the
property
goes
somewhere
else.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
