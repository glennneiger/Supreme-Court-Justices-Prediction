justice
david
h.
souter
but
none...
none
of
this
has
to
be
done
for
you
to
win
this
case,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i...
i
wish
we'd
stick
to
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
this
case
involve
anything
more
than
the
enforcement
of
an
in
personam
tort
judgment
if
you
are
to
win?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't...
isn't
it
the
case
that
she
can
have
her
claim
and
she
can
prove
her
claim,
but
she
may
not
be
able
to
collect
the
judgment
unless
the
living
trust
is
invalid?
but
that's
not
what
we're
litigating
here,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
she
have
to
show
that
is
invalid
as
distinct
from
showing
that
another
trust,
favorable
to
her,
was
not
created
and
it
was
not
created
because
of
the
tortious
conduct
of
your
client?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me...
let
me
stop
you
there
because
this
is
something
i
didn't
understand
in
the
brief.
you
speak
of
the
texas
probate
court
determining
the
validity
of
an
estate
plan.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
the
texas
probate
court
determined
the
validity
of
a
will
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
determined
the
validity
of...
of
a
pourover
trust.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
isn't
it
the
case
that
the
two
texas
determinations
can
be
respected
and
still,
in
the
federal
court,
enter
a
judgment
for
tort
liability
against
your
client?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
in...
you
may
be
right
on
that,
but
that's
not
what...
what
we're
here
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
when
you
speak
of
estate
plan,
you
are...
you
seem
to
be
talking
in
global
terms;
i.e.,
that
there
could
have
been
no
other
disposition
of
assets
by
the
decedent
or
on
behalf
of
the
decedent
except
those
which
the
texas
court
is
recognizing,
the
trust,
the
will.
is
that
what
the
texas
court
does,
or
does
the
texas
court
say,
the
will
is
good,
the
trust
is
good?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
is
it
preclusive
of
everything
else?
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
her
claim
is
assume
it's
been
made
irrevocable.
i
just
want
some
money
from
this
guy.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
all
she's
saying,
as
i
understand
it.
she...
she
can...
as
i
understand
her
cause
of
action,
it
can
proceed
on
the
assumption
the
will
is
valid,
the...
the
trust
is
valid.
just
give
me
the
money
that
i
would
have
had.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
don't...
i
don't
see
your...
your
logic
there.
of
course,
it
protects
the
succession
process,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
everything
that
implicates
a
succession
process
falls
within
the
probate
exception.
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
if
there
had
been
a
joint
bank
account,
the
succession
would
have
been
determined
based
on
the
validity
of
the
joint
bank
account,
and
that
certainly
wouldn't
have
fallen
within
the
probate
exception.
justice
david
h.
souter
does...
does
texas
law
provide
that
a...
a
living
trust
must
be
executed
and
administered
with
the
formalities
of
a
will?
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
you
have
to
get
beyond
our
probate
exception
cases
to
cover
the
living
trust.
