justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
did
involve,
at
least
the
bankruptcy
court
thought,
the
judgment
invalidating
the
inter
vivos
trust.
was
that
necessary
to
the
decision?
or
am
i...
correct
me
if
i'm--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
say...
you
say
an...
an
estate
plan.
most
people
would
think
insurance
policies
are
part
of
their
estate
plan,
and
if
it's
alleged
that
there
was
a
fraudulent
alteration
of
the
beneficiary
designation
in
the
insurance
policies,
is
that
within
the
texas
probate
court
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there's...
there's
a
further
irony
here
in
that
revocable
trusts
are
always
promoted
on
the
grounds
that
it
keeps
us
out
of
probate.
and
now
you're...
you're
insisting
that
it
has
to
be
in
probate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
can't
you
just,
for
purposes
of
understanding
the
cause
of
action
as
asserted
by
vickie
marshall
here,
just
say,
we
will
assume
the
trust
is
valid,
we
will
assume
the
will
is
valid?
all
we're
saying
was
that
there's
a
tort
and
he's
going
to
be
liable
to
us
in
tort.
