thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
sweeping
and
unqualified
language,
the
higher
education
act
provides
that,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
no
limitations
as
to
time
shall
apply
to
the
collection
of
student
loan
debt
by
offset.
therefore,
notwithstanding
the
general
10
year
limit
that
applies
to
the
offset
of
all
federal
payments,
including
social
security
payments,
no
time
limit
applies.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
right.
in
1982,
congress
authorized--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
in
1982,
federal
payments
were
subject
to
offsets
such
as
federal
grants
to
contracts
or
pension.
and,
in
1991,
congress
passed
a
law
that
said
there's
no...
going
to
be
no
time
limit
for
the
government
to
collect
student
loan
debt
by
offset.
therefore,
there
has
always
been
a
student
loan
exception
to
the
government's
ability
to
offset
for
only
up
to
10
years.
so,
we
can't
offset
federal
pension
payments
or
contract
payments
beyond
10
years
unless
it's
for
student
loans.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
(e)
is
a
limitations
period,
and
it
is
a
provision
of
law,
and
the
higher
education
act
says,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
there's
no
time
limit
for
offsetting...
for
collection
by
offset
when
it's
to
collect
student
loan
debt.
what
happened
in
1996
is,
congress
authorized
social
security
benefits
as
another
source
of
federal
payment.
but
it's
critical
to
understand
that
congress
left
completely
undisturbed
and
intact
that
preexisting
10
year
limit
and
the
pre
existing
student
loan
exception--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes,
well,
it
is
unqualified,
on
its
face,
justice
ginsburg.
it
doesn't
say
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
existing
law.
"
it
says
"any
law".
and
it
would
be
a
rather
bizarre
and
novel
statute
if
congress
had
to
keep
amending
every
time
congress
redesignated
a
limitation
provision,
which
is
all
that's
happened
here.
every
time
congress
had
a
limitation
provision
that
changed
from
subsection
(e)
to
(a),
or
was
given
a
different
section
number,
congress
would
have
to
go
back
and
say...
i
guess,
reenact
the
higher
education
act
every
time
it
amended
the
statute
of
limitations.
but,
even
if
you
think
that
it
only
applied
to
preexisting
limitations
period,
this
10
year
limit
predated
the
higher
education
act.
it
was
passed
in
1982,
and
had...
and
has
appeared
in
identical
language
since
1983.
nothing
happened
in
1996
to
statutes
of
limitations.
all
that
happened
was
that
congress,
in
essence,
put
social
security
benefits
on
par,
equal
footing,
with
all
other
federal
payments.
and
let
me
just
say,
imposing
a
10
year
limit
would
largely
nullify
social
security
offsets
to
collect
student
loan
debt.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
ninety
percent
of
all
student
loan
debtors
who
default
do
so
before
age
55.
and,
therefore,
a
10
year
time
limit
will
have
expired
before
the
debtor
reaches
full
retirement
age,
at
age
65.
and
it's
relevant
not
so
much
what
congress
what
was
thinking
in
'91,
but
it's
relevant
for
what
congress
was
thinking
in
1996.
in
1996,
congress
made
social
security
benefits
subject
to
offset.
and
it's
completely
rational
to
think
that
congress
of
course
understood
there
would
be
a
general
10
year
limit
that's
always
been
applied
to
offsets
of
all
federal
payments,
including
the
federal
contract
payments
or
pension
payments,
and
now
social
security
payments,
but,
yes,
there's
another
provision
of
the
u.s.
code
that
contains
an
express
and,
we
think,
extraordinary
exception.
it
says
time
limits
are
intolerable
when
it
comes
to
the
collection
of
student
loan
debt.
now,
at
the
same
time,
social
security
recipients
are
protected
from
any
undue
burden.
the...
if
you
are
disabled
under
the
department's
regulations,
you
can
obtain
a
complete
discharge,
a
total
walk
away
from
the
debt
forever,
if
you
have
a
disability
that
prevents
you
from
earning
income.
you
also...
the
amount
of
the
social
security
offset
is
limited
to
the
lesser
of
15
percent
of
the
benefit
payment
or
the
amount
by
which
the
benefit
payment
exceeds
$750.
and
any
debtor
can
enter
into
a
repayment
agreement
that
will
take
their
total--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the
caps,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
in
the
statute,
and
further
limited
by
the
regulations.
but,
actually,
the
repayment
agreements
are
mandated
provisions
under
the
higher
education
act.
it
mandates
the
secretary
of
education
to
allow
debtors
to
enter
in
repayment
agreements
that
are
contingent
on
their
income,
and
that
will
allow
them
to
repay
their
debt
under
reasonable
and
affordable
terms.
that's
also
in
the
statute.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's
the
lesser
of...
it's
the
lesser
of
the
15
percent
or
the
amount
by
which
the
benefit
payment
exceeds
750.
so,
in
this
case,
when
the
original
social
security
check
was,
i
think,
like,
$874,
15
percent
would
have
been
a
higher
number.
you
have
to
leave
the
recipient
with
750,
so
i
think
only
$94
was
taken
out.
and
i
may
have
my
math
a
little
off.
but
you...
the...
you
give
the
recipient
the
benefit.
now,
the
only
thing
that's
in
the
regulations,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
the
disability,
that
that
is
just
a...
it's
a
walkaway
on
the
loan.
even
if
you
win
the
lottery
the
next
day,
if
you
can
show
that
you
can't
work
because
of
a
disability,
the
secretary
of
education
will
discharge
your
loan.
now,
the
principal
argument
on
the
other
side
is
section
207
of
the
social
security
act.
now,
that
statute
requires
an
explicit
reference
before
social
security
benefits
can
be
subject
to
a
legal
process.
but
it
doesn't
require
an
explicit
reference
when
the
only
question
is
the
statute
of
limitations
that
are
applicable
to
a
legal
process
that
is
already
otherwise
expressly
authorized.
the
debt
collection
act
is
the
actual
statute
that
authorizes
the
offset
of
social
security
benefits.
the
higher
education
act
just
lifts
limitations
periods
when
there's
another
statute
that
establishes
a
collection
mechanism.
and
the
debt
collection
act
contains
the
express
reference.
it
provides,
in
3716,
that,
"we're
making
our
clear
statement,
we
want
social
security
benefits
to
be
subject
to
offset.
"
and,
like
i
said,
it
just...
it
plugged
the
social
security
system
into
this
preexisting--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right.
it
makes
the
express
reference
to
207,
and
it
has
this
general
limitations
period
that
applies
to
all
offsets.
but,
justice
stevens,
just--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right.
and
that
takes
you
down
to
the
subsection
(e),
which
imposes
a
10
year
limit.
but
just
as
today
congress
certainly
is
free
to
say,
"from
now
on,
social
security
benefits
and
all
offsets
will
be
subject
to
an
11
year
limitations
period.
"
it
doesn't
have
to
expressly
reference
207
to
amend
the
debt
collection
act.
the
debt
collection
act
is
what's
being,
in
effect,
amended
or
an
exception.
and
the
debt
collection
act
doesn't
contain
its
own
express
reference
requirement
before
it
can
be
amended.
congress
didn't
say,
"we're
forever
binding
ourselves",
or,
"we
want
some
different
canon
of
interpretation
here.
"
and
so,
you
have
a
very
extraordinary
provision
in
the
higher
education
act
that
says,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
there's
not
going
to
be
a
time
limit
to
offset
in
order
to
collect
student
loan--
"
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it
would
still...
the
express
reference
would
be
completely
overtaken,
because
it
says
the
207>
["].
it
would
authorize
offset
for--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--for
up
to
10
years.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
it
would...
the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
well,
our
position
is
that
the
social
security
act
only
requires
an
express
reference
to
create
authorization
to
offset.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
well,
our--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--fundamental
position--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i'll
be
clear
on
this...
is
that
the
higher
education
act
applies
unless
it's
been
repealed.
and
there's
just
nothing
in
the
higher
education
act
that
comes
close
to
repealing...
in,
excuse
me,
the
debt
collection
act...
that
comes
close
to
repealing
the
higher
education
act,
because
it
doesn't
address
the
subject
of
student
loans.
it
just
speaks
to
the
ability
to
offset
social
security
benefits,
as
well
as
all
other
federal
payments
that
have
been
subject
to
offset.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
i
know
of
no
statement
to
that
effect.
but
i
know
of
no
statement...
any
discussion
about
limitations
period.
there's
no
discussion
of
the
10
year
limit
either.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
maybe
they
did,
maybe
they
didn't.
maybe
the
knew
that
a
court
would
actually
apply
the
u.s.
code,
as
written--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--and
just
because
it...
the
limitation
period
was
in
one
section...
but,
now,
here's
where
i
think
the
policy
does
come
into
play.
a
legislature
would
think
that
a
10
year
limit
would
never
come
in
to
offset
social
security
benefits
on
student
loan,
except
in
a
rare
case
of
an
old
debtor
who...
and
also
defaults
close
in
time
to
age
65.
and,
like
i
said,
90
percent
of
all
the
student
loan
defaults
are
by
debtors
who
are
under
age
55,
and
over...
about
83
or
84
percent
of
all
social
security
payments
are
under
the
retirement
system,
not
the
disability
system.
and
if
a
person
is
disabled,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
they
can't
get
a
discharge
of
that
loan.
so,
all
we're
talking
about
is
basically
rendering
a
dead
letter
social
security
offsets
to
collect
student
loan
debt,
if
petitioner's
position
were
to
prevail.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
you
can
get
a
discharge
of
your
loan
if
you
have
a
disability
of
indefinite
duration
that
prevents
you
from
working.
the
rationale
is,
sort
of,
a
changed
circumstances
rationale.
if
you
took
out
a
loan,
you
signed
a
promissory
note,
you
intend
to
pay
it
back.
but
if
you
later
become
disabled,
and
that
disability
is
going
to
prevent
you
from
ever
working,
they'll
discharge
it.
now,
about
30
percent
of
all
people
who
do
apply
for
this
disability
discharge
do
get
it,
and
about
80
percent
get
a
conditional
discharge,
what
gives
them...
it
gives
them
a
3
year
grace
period.
and
the
only
difference
between...
i
mean,
there
are
some
small
differences,
but
the
main
difference
between
a
social
security
disability
determination
and
an
education
department
disability
determination
is
the
department
of
education
wants
you
to
be
disabled
of
an
indefinite
duration,
and
not
just
12
months,
because
it's
a
complete
and
total
walkaway
from
the
loan.
and
social
security
will
actually
do
a
lookback
after
12
months.
but
education
will
never
go
back
and
ask
for
the
money.
once
they've
discharged
it,
it's
a
permanent
discharge.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
i--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
remember
trying
to
find
it
on
westlaw.
it's,
like,
3,000
pages.
it's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--huge.
and
it
covers
many,
many
different
subjects.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that,
i
don't
recall.
but
i
can
say
the
overall
thrust...
and
it's
in
their
statement
of
purpose...
was
to
improve
the
government's
debt
collection--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--efforts.
and
what
it
did
was,
for
the
first
time...
and
this
was
a
very
significant
development...
establish
a
centralized
offset.
before
1996,
there
was
no
ability
to
cross
check
a
debt
from
one
agency
to
a
payment
to--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--another
agency,
such
that
one
department
had
no
idea
what
another
department
was
doing.
and
now
it
is
a
massive
program
involving
over
$1
trillion
of
federal
payables,
$255
billion
of
certified
debt,
and
33
billion
of
that
is
education
loan
debt.
and
so,
that...
this
was
to...
an
enormous
undertaking
to
start
that,
in
1996.
and
one
of
the
things
that
congress
did
in
setting
up
this
massive
program
was,
made
social
security
benefits
part
of
the
offset
program.
there's
about
$480
or
$490
billion
in
social
security
benefits,
so...
which...
it
was
a
huge
source
of
revenue,
although
congress
obviously
limited
it
substantially
with
the--
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
be
affirmed.
