mr.
brian
wolfman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
section
207
of
the
social
security
act
contains
a
broad
ban
on
the
attachment
of
social
security
benefits
that
may
be
overridden
if,
in
doing
so,
congress
expressly
refers
to
section
207.
our
basic
position
is
that
the
effect
of
an
express
reference
to
section
207
can
go
no
further
than
the
authority
that
is
granted
in
the
statute
that
includes
the
express
reference.
therefore,
here,
the
debt
collection
act,
the
statute
that
contains
that
express
reference,
prohibits
offsets
to
collect
claims
that
have
been
outstanding
for
more
than
10
years.
therefore,
the
government
lacks
offset
authority
to
collect
mr.
lockhart's
older
debts.
the
debt
collections
act's
10
year
bar
on
the
right
of
the
government
to
offset
debt
from
governmental
payments
owing
to
debtors
was
enacted
in
1982.
but,
at
that
time,
the
government
did
not
have
authority
to
offset
social
security
benefits
at
all.
the
government's
claim
that
there's
no
10
year
bar
here
relies
entirely
on
a
provision
of
the
higher
education
technical
amendments
that
overrode
statutes
of
limitations
for
collecting
student
debts.
but
that
was
passed
in
1991,
5
years
before
the...
before...
the
government
had
authority
to
offset
social
security
benefits
at
all.
that
authority,
as
i've
referred
to,
came
only
in
1996,
in
the
debt
collection
improvement
act,
which
did
expressly
refer
to
the
social
security
act's
anti
attachment
provision.
but--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i
will
say
that
that
is
something
that
we've
considered.
it's
not
briefed
here,
but
i
think
the
issue
is
not
presented
here.
and
here's
why
because
in...
what
occurred
in
1996
comported
with
the
express
reference
requirement.
the
problem
here
is
that...
so,
it
said
that
they
can
offset
social
security
benefits.
but
it
is
contained
in
a
statute
that
includes
the
10
year
bar.
so,
even
if
the
antiattachment
provision
did
not
exclude
the
express
reference
provision,
it
still...
whatever
allowed
the
attachment
has
to
be,
in
our
view,
coincident
with
the
statute
in
which
the
express
reference--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
was
1991.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
occurred
in
1996.
but,
as
i--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--the
reason
that's--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--because--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--because,
with
respect,
that's
not
what
congress
said
in
1996.
mr.
brian
wolfman
they
didn't
say,
"go
get
'em".
what
they
did
is,
as
an
amendment
to
the
debt
collection
act,
in
the
debt
collection
improvement
act,
they
inserted
permission
to
go...
to
offset
social
security
benefits
in
a
statute
that
has
a
10
year
bar.
so--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--yes,
but...
but,
again,
getting
back...
and
i
think
this
takes
us
back
to
justice
scalia's
question...
that...
the...
there
is
a
broad
anti
attachment
provision.
there
is
an
express
reference
requirement.
our
view
is
that
the...
that...
those
requirements
can
go
no...
the
abrogation
of
the...
of
the
bar
to
offset
social
security
benefits,
or
to
attach
social
security
benefits
in
any
way,
can
go
no
further
than
the
statute
in
which
that
abrogation
occurs.
and
this
statute
has
a
10
year
bar.
so,
if
i
can
explain
further,
the
debt
collection
improvement
act,
and
the
debt
collection
act
before
it,
has
a
10
year
bar.
it's
not
merely
a
statute
of
limitations.
it
says
that
the
government
has
no
authority
to
offset
after
the
10
year
period,
after
the
claim
has
been
outstanding
for
more
than
10
years.
that's
the
statute
that
includes
the
abrogation
of
the
offset
of
social
security
benefits.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
i--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
is
our
argument.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
brian
wolfman
but
i
would
only
qualify
it--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--no,
i
would
disagree,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
my
only
quarrel
with
your
question
is
that
it's
not
implicit,
it
is
explicit.
the
statute...
the
debt
collection
improvement
act,
as
the
debt
collection
act
before
it,
contains
a
10
year
bar
on
the
authority
of
the
government
to
offset.
this
is
not
a
mere
statute
of
limitations
defense
that
can
be
waived.
this
is
a
complete
lack
of
authority
to
the...
in
the
government
to
offset.
that's--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--the
statute--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
what
it
says--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--yes,
and
i
think...
that's
exactly
my
point.
what
(e)
says
is
that
this
act
does
not
apply...
and
i'm
quoting
now...
"this
act
does
not
apply
when
the
claim
has
been
outstanding
for
more
than
10
years.
"
that
strikes
us...
you
can
call
it
"limitations"
if
you
want,
but
it
strikes
us
as
a
very
powerful
one.
because
it
restricts
the
government's
ability
to
bring
such
a
case--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--for
offset.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
i...
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that
the
actual
nomenclature
matters
that
much,
but
i
will
distinguish
it
from
what
the
law
normally
calls
a
limitations
period,
because
a
limitations
period
is
one
that
is
raised
as
an
affirmative
defense
and
may
be
waived.
this
provision,
where
it
says,
"this
act
does
not
apply"--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--does
not
apply.
mr.
brian
wolfman
oh,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
one,
but
my
point,
again,
is
simply
that
the
government
has
no
authority
to
proceed.
so,
then
we
look...
we
look
at
that
statute,
and
we
say,
"what
did
the...
what
did
the
congress
do
in
1996?
"
what
the
congress
did
in
1996
was
amend
that
very
statute
by
saying,
"within
the
confines
of
this
statute,
you
may
now
offset.
"
mr.
brian
wolfman
but
that's--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--you
know,
again,
if...
it
is
not...
the
purposes
of
the
bar
are
not
stated
in
any
of
the
legislative
materials,
and
we
can
assume
that
at
least
one
of
the
principal
purposes
was
to
not
allow
the
litigation,
the
contesting
of
stale
claims,
or
to
give
the
individuals
repose,
which
is
a
purpose
of
time
bars.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
i
think
there
are...
there
are...
i...
there
are
several
answers.
and,
if
i
might,
first
of
all,
if
you
must
characterize
what...
and
we
are
happy
to
do
so...
what
is
in
the
1996
act
as
either
a
time
bar
or
a
limitations
period,
this
is
clearly
the
former,
because
this...
because
the
limitations
periods
in
the
law
are
ones
which
have
to
be
raised
by
affirmative
defense.
for
instance,
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
say
limitations
periods
are
raised
by
affirmative
defense,
and
the
case
law
is
unanimous
that
they
can
be
waived.
that
is
not
what
this
provision
does.
this
provision
restricts
the
authority,
in
the
first
instance,
for
the
government
to
bring
the
case.
the
second
thing
i
would
say,
though,
your
honor...
and
i
think
it
does
not
matter,
ultimately...
that
can
be
our
principal
submission
here,
and
it
is,
but
it
does
not
matter...
i
think,
ultimately,
the
nomenclature
doesn't
matter,
because...
again,
because
the
act
restricts
the
authority
of
the
government
to
bring
a
case
that
is
beyond
the
10
year
period.
and
that
is
the
statute
that
contains
the
express
reference.
that
is
the--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--no,
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
mean--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i
understand
that.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
that's
right.
the...
and
i...
i
don't
think
that
undercuts
our
argument
at
all,
because,
after
all,
there's
no
question
that,
prior
to
1996,
there
was
offset
authority
in
the
government
to
offset...
to
collect
debt
against
other
types
of
income,
other
than
social
security.
so,
i
don't
think
that
undercuts
our
argument
at
all.
but
let
me,
if
i
might,
go
back
to
your
question
one
more
time,
because
i
think
there's
yet
a
third
answer,
which
is...
which
is
the
chronological
answer
that...
made
in
our
briefs
that,
in
1991,
the
congress
could
not
have
had
the
intent
to
get
at
social
security
benefits
at
all,
because,
of
course,
there...
and
it's...
this
point
is
conceded...
the
government
had
no
authority
whatsoever
to
offset
social
security
benefits.
if
i
might,
in
the...
let
me
go--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--uh
huh.
mr.
brian
wolfman
the
heta
law,
yeah.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
but
i...
but
i...
with
all
respect,
i
think
our
interpretation
certainly
does
not
render
heta
nugatory,
because
heta
would
still
override
limitations
periods
for
other
forms
of
collection
with
respect
to
other
types--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--of
debts.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
it...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that
question.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
that
may
be,
but
let
me,
again,
if
i...
if
i
might,
respond
to
that...
to
this...
to
this
point,
because
i
think
it
is
true
that
the
proportion
of
times
under
our
argument
that
the
10
year
bar
would
apply
would...
is
greater
under
our
position,
but
it
is,
nevertheless,
true
that
heta
still
applies
to
many
situations,
under
our
reading,
and
the
10-year
bar
applies
to
somewhat
more.
but
let
me...
i
think
there's
another
answer
to
your
point,
which
is,
it
still
does
not
undercut
our
basic
submission
that
the
congress
could
not
have
formed
this
specific
intent.
and
it's
very
unlike
the...
the
intent
being
to
get
to
the
government
the...
the
result
it
seeks
here.
and
the
reason
for
that
is...
is,
they
could
not
have
focused
on
this
problem,
because
in...
it
wasn't
for
another
5
years
that
social
security
was
even
on
the
radar
screen
at
all.
and
this
brings
me
back,
i
think,
to
justice
breyer's--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--initial
question.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
that--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
is
correct.
and
i
think
that...
but
with
a
caveat,
which
i'll
get
to...
but...
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
a...
it
is
a
consequence
of
the
situation
that
congress
found
itself
in,
in
1996.
in
other
words,
it
already
had
a
statute,
the
offset
statute,
which
had
a
10
year
bar.
and
so--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
in
that...
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
the
exception
for
student
loans.
there--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
1091
was
in
a
different
statutory
provision,
in
a
different
part
of
the
code.
but
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is,
they--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--right.
it
was
in
a
1991
statute
that
was
a
freestanding
statute
that
dealt
with
social
security
benefits,
generally.
then
what
you
had
in
1996
was
a
focus
on
offsets,
specifically,
and
on
social
security,
specifically.
and
the
only
point--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that's
right.
and...
but
it
mentions
a
lot
of...
many
meanings
of
"collection",
that
is
correct.
and...
but
i
think
it's
not
quite
fair
to
say
that
they
merely
reenacted
the
10
year
bar.
we
think
that's
sufficient
for
us
to
prevail.
but,
you
know,
the
congress,
in
1996,
did
a
pretty
comprehensive
overall...
overhaul
of
the
debt
collection
act.
it
appears
to
have
gone
through
every
section.
it
strengthened
some
of
the
notice
provisions.
it
focused
specifically
on
social
security
and
said
that
you
can
now
offset
them
by
making
the
express
reference.
and
then
it
turned
to...
what
had
been
subsection
(c)
then
became
subsection
(e).
it
amended
one
of
the
paragraphs,
but
retained
the
paragraph
that
has
the
10
year
bar.
so,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
congress
looked
at
all
the
sections
carefully.
now--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--uh
huh.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
that...
the
government
certainly
makes
that
submission
in
its
brief,
but,
as
we
note
in
our
reply
brief,
the
statistics
the
government
cites
don't
really
back
that
up.
i...
but
we
do...
we
do
acknowledge
that,
with
respect
to
social
security
retirement
benefits,
there
will
be
many
people
who
are
beyond
the
10
year
bar.
with
respect
to
people
who
get
other
sorts
of
social
security
benefits,
that's
not
clear
at
all,
actually.
there
are
survivors--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--and
there
are
disability--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--are
a--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--larger
number,
that
is
true.
mr.
brian
wolfman
but,
again,
i
don't
think
that...
there's
no...
there's
no
suggestion
in...
the
problem...
the
ultimate
problem
with
that
point
for
the
government,
justice
stevens,
is
that
it
requires
us
to
believe
that
congress
formed
that
intent
in
1991,
which
is
an
impossibility,
because--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--in
1991,
social
security
benefits
were
just,
sort
of,
off
the
table.
they
weren't
on
the
radar
screen
at
all.
and
that's
the
ultimate
problem
with
the
government's--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--theory
there.
mr.
brian
wolfman
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
the
record
is
completely
silent
on
that
question.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
he
was
certainly
disabled.
i
will
only
point
out
that
the
standards
for
total
and
permanent
disability
under
the
department
of
education
regs
are
much
more
stringent
than
those
for
social
security,
because
that
only
requires
a
12
month
period
of
disability.
but
i
don't
know
the
answer
as
to
him.
i'm...
i
do
want
to
get
to
one
other
point
before
i
sit
down,
and...
which
is
to
address
one
of
the
government's
arguments...
is
that
to...
to
get
around
a...
the
problem
that
the
dcia
reenacted
the
10
year
bar,
the
government
relies
on
the
1991
education
act,
arguing
that
it
wipes
away
any
time
bar,
regardless
of
when
the
time
bar
was
enacted,
and
no
matter
what
type
of
collection
is
at
issue.
but,
as
we
note
in
our
reply
brief
extensively,
those
"notwithstanding"
clauses
are
not
as
all
powerful
as
the
government
suggests
they
are.
and
what
the
case
law...
the
lower
court
case
law
suggests
is
that
you
need
to
look,
as
we
have
done
in
our
submission,
at
the
legislative
history
and
the
legislative
motive
surrounding
both
acts,
the
previous
act
and
the
subsequent
act.
and,
here,
what
you
have...
and
i
don't
want
to
beat
a
dead
horse,
but
i
will
repeat
once
again
that
the
problem
here
is...
for
the
government...
is
that
we
have
this
very
powerful
anti
attachment
provision
with
its
express
reference
requirement.
and
the
only
place
in
these
statutory
materials
where
the
express
reference
occurs
is
in
a...
the
very
act
that
includes
the
10
year
bar.
and
to
accept
the
government's
argument,
you
would
have
to
accept
the
notion
that
the...
an
express
reference
in
an
act
can
go
beyond
the
authority
that's
granted
by
that
very
act.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes.
mr.
brian
wolfman
right.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--right.
mr.
brian
wolfman
right.
mr.
brian
wolfman
and
i--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--but
i--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--but
i
think
that
that's--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that's
the
nub
of
the
case--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--the
special
reasons.
but...
but
i...
but
i...
let
me...
let
me...
let
me
answer
your
question--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that's
where
i--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i
think,
on
these
legislative
materials,
they
have
quite
a
burden.
and
let
me
explain
why.
your...
the...
justice
breyer,
the
hypothetical
you
posit
is
one
with
which
i
can
agree.
we
are
not
saying...
i
don't
want
to
be
mistaken...
that...
we
are
not
saying
that
previous
legislation
can't
have
effect
on
future
events,
or
even
future
legislation.
we're
not
saying
that
all.
but
the
nub
of
our
argument
is
this
express
reference
requirement,
and
i
think
it's...
it
seems
very,
very
odd
to
us
that
when
you
have
a
statute
that
has
an...
where
the
express
reference
appears,
and
that
has
a
10
year
bar
on
the
authority--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--to
collect--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--right.
i
think
that...
that
is
a
fair
characterization
of
one
our
arguments
here--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--which...
one
of
our
arguments
here
is,
given
the
various
indicia
of
intent,
both
in
'91
and
'96,
that
the
'96
act,
with
respect
to
a
small
sliver
of
collections,
is
effectively
an
amendment
of
the
'91
act.
however,
that
is
not
our
only,
or
even
our
principal
submission.
our
principal
submission
has
to
do
with
the
powerful
anti
attachment--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--provision.
mr.
brian
wolfman
okay?
and,
again,
the
government's
position...
and
i
will
rest
after
this,
because
i've
repeated
this
already...
but
the...
the
government's
position
is,
in
effect,
that
you
can
use
the
anti
attachment
position
in
the
express
reference
requirement
in
a
statute
to
allow
authority
beyond
that
very
statute.
and
we
submit
that
that
is...
that
is
not
permissible
under
section
407.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
brian
wolfman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
address,
first,
a
point
that
the
government
makes,
that...
and
it's
about
section
207
of
the
social
security
act,
the
antiattachment
provision.
opposing
counsel
says
that
it
doesn't
really
matter
that
the
10
year
bar
was
not
addressed
in
1996,
because
all
that's
necessary
under
the
express
reference
provision
is
to
refer
to
the
law,
in
general,
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
limitations
periods.
but
that
simply
cannot
be
the
case
here,
because,
again,
this
statute
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
debt
collection
improvement
act,
and
the
debt
collection
act
before,
is
a
bar
on
the
authority
of
the
government
to
collect
after
10
years.
and
let
me
pick
up
on
the
language
that
justice
kennedy
pointed
to
from
the
debt
collection
act.
it
says,
in
the
very
subsection
in
which
social
security
first
was
put
on
the
radar
screen,
was
first
dealt
with,
(c)(3)(a)(i)...
it
says
that
you
can
now
go
after
social
security
benefits,
because
they
are
subject
to
offset
under
this
section,
meaning
3716.
then,
if
you
turn
to
another
subsection
of
that
section,
it
says...
and
this
is
the
10
year
bar...
this
section,
quote,
10
years.
now,
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
say
that
207,
the
requirement
of
an
express
reference,
is,
sort
of,
a
halfway
requirement.
in
other
words,
"you
only
have
to
refer
to
social
security
benefits.
"
"we
don't
care
what
the
extent
of
that
authority
is
in
the
very
section
that
you
use
that
express
reference.
"
here,
the
entire
authority
is
circumscribed
by
the
10
year
bar.
that
is
our
essential
submission.
i
have
one
other
point,
which
is
that
the...
because
there
was
a
number
of
questions
on
it.
we
think
it
doesn't
go
to
the
congressional
intent
here,
but
i
do
want
to
clarify.
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
being
disabled
and
being
eligible
to
get
the
discharge.
discharge
requires
permanent
disability...
forever,
you
cannot...
you
are
not
capable
of
working.
in
social
security
law,
you
have
to
be
incapable
of
working
for
a
period
of
12
months.
thank
you.
