justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
didn't
contain
the
bar
at
the
time
that
they
said,
"you
can
collect
it".
in
the
later
statute,
which
said,
"you
now
can
collect
out
of
social
security.
"
when
they
passed
that,
did
it
contain
a
10
year
bar?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
higher
education
act
said...
as
of
what
year
did
the
higher
education
act
say,
"no
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
us?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--1991,
it
said,
"no
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
us.
"
then,
in
what
year
did
the
statute...
was
passed
which
said,
"and
you
can
collect
money
out
of
social
security
payments
for
higher
education?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
it?
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
there
was
no...
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations
applying
to
the
social
security
act;
and
then,
in
1996,
they
say,
"and
now
go
get
'em".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
can
we
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did
they
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
a
10
year
bar.
but
the
earlier
1991
act
says,
"that
doesn't
apply
to
us".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
that
provision
of
the
later
statute
that
says,
"go
get
'em
on
social
security.
"
implicitly
reads
into
it
the
10
year
bar
that's
in
a
different
part
of
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
it's
as
if
it
said,
"go
get
'em
on
social
security,
under
407,
which
is
gone
now,
but
only
for
10
years.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
your...
i'm
trying
to
understand
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
problem
is,
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
can
call
it
any
purpose
you
want,
but
there
is
an
earlier
word
in
9...
1091(a),
just
what
justice
kennedy
said.
the
earlier
word
says
limitations
don't
apply
to
the
higher
education
debt.
and
so,
if
this
later
statute,
the
words
you're
talking
about,
the
words
of
10
years>
["],
the
words
that
limit
when
you
can
do
it,
if
those
words,
which
are
in
subsection
(e),
are
a
"limitation",
then
i
guess
the
earlier
statute
says
they
don't
apply
to
the
higher
education
debt.
and
so,
i
don't
see
how
you
get
out
of
that.
i
mean...
i
mean,
this
is
a
rather
harsh
result.
i
understand
why
you'd
like
to
get
out
of
it.
but
i
don't
understand
how
we
do
get
out
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it...
i
mean,
you...
it's...
it
probably
comes
up
a
lot.
you
have...
you
have
the
earlier
act
that
imposes...
suppose
you
have
some...
endangered
species
act
and...
at
an
earlier
time...
and
it
says
all
provisions
of
a
certain
kind
will
have
this
effect
in
respect
to
endangered
species.
and
then
you
have
some
laters
act...
later
acts.
and,
in
those
later
acts,
there
are
certain
things
about
how
to
treat
certain
animals
and
so
forth.
and
the
question
would
be,
"well,
does
that
earlier
thing,
telling
you
how
to
treat
an
endangered
species,
apply
now
to
the
animals
in
this
later
act
insofar
as
they're
endangered?
"
and
the
answer
would
be,
"of
course
it
does"--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--unless
there's
some
special
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
thinking
that
it
doesn't.
and
so,
what's
the
special
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--here?
you
have
an
earlier
act
that
says,
when
you
see
those
words,
10
year
limitations>
["],
forget
'em
where
student
loans
in
effect.
now
we
have
a
later
act,
and
it
has
the
word
10
year
limitations>
["],
and
you're
giving
some
reasons
why--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
is
special
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
forth.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
they're--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--strong
enough--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--uh
huh.
yes,
that
is
the
nub.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
i
mean,
they
don't
have
that
big
burden
to
show.
they
have
to
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--show
it's
normal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
have
to
show
it's
special.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
is
the
statute...
i
saw
something
here,
that
a
person
who's
going
to
get
this
offset,
and
he
has
social
security,
you
exempt
$9,000
of
the
social
security,
and
then
you
limit
it
to
15
percent
of
the
remainder
or
whatever
is
reasonable,
whichever
is
less.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
yeah,
i
think
he's...
one
argument
that
they're
emphasizing,
anyway,
is
that...
you
look
at
the
debt
collection
act,
and
suppose
it
had
said
the
following,
"section
207
is
amended,
or
changed,
as
follows.
"
"we
refer
specially
now...
we
can
collect,
through
offset,
but
only
for
10
years.
"
"i
mean,
only
to
claims
that
are
more
than
10
years
old.
"
"so,
we
are
changing
what
207
says
for
debts
over
10
year...
under
10
years
old,
and
we
can
offset
those.
"
now,
suppose
it
had
said
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you'd
say
it's
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
the
same,
let's
imagine
this
statute.
the
statute
says,
"we
bestow
upon
the
social
security
agency
a
very
limited
power.
"
and
it
says,
"this
is
the
limited
power.
"
"the
social
security
agency
may,
despite
207,
levy
offsets
on
under
10
year
old
debts.
"
that's
what
they
say,
right
in
the
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then,
indeed,
the
whole
point
of
it...
it's
entitled
"limited
offset
ability",
parenthesis...
"limited
offset
ability,
extending
only
to
debts
of
less
than
ten
years.
"
end
parenthesis.
that's
the
title
of
the
act,
and
then
it
says
just
what
i
say,
repeating
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're
not
going
to
treat
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--one
the
same.
you
see,
what
they're
saying
here
is...
they
want
to
say
that
what
i've
just
said
is
what
congress
wrote
in
this
act.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
making
it
harder
and
harder
for
you
to
accept
that
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--automatically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
