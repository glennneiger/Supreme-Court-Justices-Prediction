justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
this
question?
that's
a
very...
that's
a
very
interesting
statutory
construction
case,
i
must
say,
by
the
way.
but
the...
in
1996,
when
they
made
the
offset
available
against
social
security
payments,
they
didn't
enact
a
10
year
statute
of
limitations;
they
changed
subsection,
i
think,
(b)
to
(d)
and
said
the
10
year
provision
is
retained.
and
when
the
10
year
provision
was
first
put
in...
i
mean,
when
the
exception
for
student
loans
was
made,
in
1991,
you
had
a
statute
that
had
a
10
year
period
for
everything
except
student
loan
recovery.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
look
at
the
1996
statute
as
saying,
"we're
going
to
allow
offsets
against
social
security.
"
under
the
same
scheme
that
was
enacted
in
1991,
because
we
had
just
amended
the
10
year
provision
to
preserve
it...
they
preserved
the
10
year
provision...
that
they
seem
to
me
to
be
preserving
it
in
a
statute
that
made
this
distinction
between
student
loans
and
all
other
offsets.
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
isn't
as
though
they
enacted,
for
the
first
time,
an
authority
to
offset
social
security
and,
in
that
statute,
said,
"and...
but,
by
the
way,
there's
a
10
year
period
of
limitations
here.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
rather,
they
amended
the
1991
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
also
had
the
exception
for
student
loans.
it's...
it
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--side
by
side
with
the
rest
of
the
10
year
bar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
1091(a).
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
in
the
1991
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
say
that...
let
me
just
throw
this
thought
out,
so
you
can
comment
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
assuming
congress
might
have
thought
that
student
loans
should
not
have
a
10
year
bar
if
you're
going
to
collect
from
social
security,
because
most
social
security
payments
won't
accrue
until
many,
many
years...
much
more
than
10
years
after
the
student
loan
default.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
there
is
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--retirement
benefits
are
a
pretty
big
part--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
the
whole
package.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--wolfman,
couldn't
you
say
the
question
could
be
phrased
in
this
way?
do
we
view
the
notwithstanding
language
in
1091(a)
as
enacted
in
1091
and
governing
the
future,
or
do
we
view
the
1996
amendment
as,
in
effect,
an
amendment
to
that
stat
which...
which
reenacted
the
provisions
that
were
already
there?
and
if
it's
a
reenactment
in
1996,
then
it's
just
an
exception
from
the
10
year
bar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
didn't
include
social
security
payments
when
it
was
enacted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
1991.
either
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is...
it
is
true
that
the
1996
statute,
which
is
the
first
time
the
express
reference
appears,
does
contain
the
10
year
statute
by
the
indirect
reference,
and
does
not
expressly
refer
to
the...
cite
the
1091(a).
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
blatt,
can
i
ask...
there's
no
discussion...
legislative
history
in
the
briefs
that
i...
because
i...
that
i
recall.
is
it
true
that
the
people
voting
on
the
bill
in
1996
had
nothing
but
the
amendment
before
them?
did
they
have
a
committee
report
on
it
explaining
that
it
still
applied
to
the...
that
the...
that
the
1091(a)
would
still
be
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
seems
to
me
that,
conceivably,
a
legislator
looking
at
the
bill
all
by
itself,
not
getting
out
the
earlier
provisions
of
the
code,
might
well
think,
"well,
this
includes
a
10
year
limit.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
blatt,
it...
was
this
statute...
i'm
just
really
kind
of
curious
that
something
this
important,
we're
first
putting
this
burden
on
social
security...
it's
a
fairly
important
change.
was
this
part
of
one
of
these
omnibus
bills
that
covered
99
different
subjects
at
once?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
did
not
have
a
separate
committee
proceeding
on
each
separate
part
of
that
monster
bill--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
i
remember.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
