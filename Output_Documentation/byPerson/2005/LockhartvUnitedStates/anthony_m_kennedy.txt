are--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
you
saying
that
this
has
a
purpose
other
than
barring
stable...
stale
claims?
it's
simply
designed
to
limit
the
offset
provisions
in
order
to
allow
other
federal
programs
to
proceed
and...
i'm
looking
for
some
way
for
you
to
describe
(e)
as
being
something
other
than
a
limitations
provision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think...
because
i
think
that
would
help
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
we
call
it
1991
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
you
give
me
a
reason
for
the
government's
adopting
(e),
the
10
year...
the
10
year
bar,
other
than
for
stale
claims
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
understand
that,
but
i'm
just...
i'm
just
saying,
if
you
could
give
me
an
explanation,
a
characterization,
a
description,
a
statement
of
purpose
that's
other
than
the
bar
on
stale
claims,
i
think
you'd
have
a
stronger
case.
but
it
seems
to
me
just
like
a
stale
claims
statute,
so
i
go
back
and
look
for
other
limitations
period,
and
i
find
it
in
1091(a).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
part
of
the
problem
is
that
1091(a)(2),
the
"notwithstanding"
clause,
talks
also
specifically
about
offsets,
which
is
what
this
is,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
if
it
had
said
"no"--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--"#
no
limitations
period",
then
i
might...
this
specifically
talks
about
an
offset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then...
but
then,
in...
you
know,
you
know
what's
coming.
you...
the
provision
you
rely
on
is
3116,
and
it's
stuck
into
the
middle
of
this...
of
a
provision
which
requires
written
notice,
opportunity
to
inspect
records,
and
so
forth.
all
those
apply.
but
you
have
to
say
that
(e)
doesn't
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
says...
and
it
says
"offsets
under
this
section".
