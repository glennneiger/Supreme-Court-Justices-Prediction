justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
pursue
that
point
for
a
second--
justice
david
h.
souter
--more?
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
would
have
a
much
stronger
argument
on
that
point
if,
in
1996,
the
act
provided
that,
suddenly,
social
security
benefits...
some
social
security
benefits
would
be...
would
be
subject
to
administrative
offset,
but
only
those
when
the
government...
imposed
when
the
government
is
trying
to
collect
educational
loans.
we
would
then
have
what
seems
to...
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
really
head
to
head
conflict
between
the
two
statutes.
the
trouble
is
that,
in
1996,
the
extension
of
the
administrative
setoff
authority
covered
social
security
benefits
to
be...
for
which
there
would
be
a
setoff
for
any
purpose...
not
just
educational
loans;
for
any
purpose.
so
that,
in
fact,
it
is
possible
for
us
to
read
the
1996
act
as
having
an
effect...
there's
a
10
year
limit,
generally...
at
the
same
time
that
we
read
the
earlier...
i
forget
what
the...
'91,
i
guess
it
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
says,
with
respect
to
educational
loan
collections,
including
by
setoff,
there's
no
limitation
at
all.
so,
we
can
have
both
statutes
without
rendering
either
one
of
them
nugatory.
and
isn't
that
the
preferred
way
to
read
statutes?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
with--
justice
david
h.
souter
--with
respect
to
social
security
setoffs,
of
course,
it
would.
justice
david
h.
souter
social
security...
social
security
said
it
would
be...
it
would
be
a...
it
would...
a
flat
head
to
head
contradiction,
no
matter
how
you
read
it,
on
social
security
setoffs
for
educational
loans.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
that's
the
only
thing
that
the
1996
act
covered,
we
would
say,
"boy,
there
is
just
an
absolute
conflict
here.
"
"we
can't
have
both
statutes.
"
but,
in
fact,
we
have
both
statutes
most
of
the
time.
we
read
the
1996
10
year
limitation
as
covering
everything
except
setoffs
against
social
security
for
educational
loans.
and,
with
respect
to
the
educational
loans,
we
give
respect
to
the...
to
the
earlier
decision
that
there
be
no
limitation
at
all.
you
just
have
a
weaker
argument
than
you
would
have
if
the
1996
act
only
covered
this
case.
