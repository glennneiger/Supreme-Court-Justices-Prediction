are
there
provisions
by
regulation
in
the
department
of
education
for
discharge
of
debts
like
this
on
a
showing
of
total
and
permanent
disability?
justice
sandra

o'connor
and
your
client
doesn't
qualify,
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit.
it
concerns
the
government’s
effort
to
withhold
part
of
the
petitioner’s
social
security
benefits
to
offset
his
debt
on
federally
reinsured
student
loans
that
are
more
than
ten
years
overdue.
whether
the
government
can
do
this
is
determined
by
a
rather
complicated
interplay
of
four
statutes.
first,
we
have
two
statutes
about
time
limits.
the
debt
collection
act
lets
the
government
collect
debts
by
administrative
offsets,
subject
to
a
general
ten-year
statute
of
limitations;
but
the
higher
education
technical
amendments
of
1991
eliminate
time
limits
on
suits
to
collect
student
loans.
next,
we
have
two
statutes
about
the
government’s
ability
to
subject
social
security
benefits
to
offset.
social
security
benefits
are
generally
exempt
from
attachment
or
other
legal
process.
the
social
security
act
purports
to
protect
this
anti-attachment
rule
with
an
express
reference
provision.
the
statute
says
no
other
provision
of
law
may
be
construed
to
modify
this
section
except
to
the
extent
that
it
does
so
by
express
reference.
but
the
debt
collection
improvement
act
of
1996
subjects
social
security
benefits
to
administrative
offset,
making
express
reference
to
the
social
security
act.
now,
petitioner
here
argued
that
the
debt
collection
act’s
ten-year
statute
of
limitations
controlled,
so
the
government
could
not
offset
his
social
security
benefits.
the
9th
circuit
disagreed
and
held
that
the
higher
education
technical
amendments
had
eliminated
that
time
limit
as
to
student
loans.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm
the
9th
circuit’s
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
1991
and
1996
statutes
make
social
security
benefits
subject
to
offset,
providing
exactly
the
sort
of
express
reference
the
social
security
act
says
is
necessary
to
supersede
the
anti-attachment
provision
and
remove
the
ten-year
limit
that
we
otherwise
would
say
barred
the
government’s
action.
debt
collection
by
social-security
offset
was
not
authorized
until
1996,
five
years
after
the
abrogation
of
time
limits;
but
the
plain
meaning
of
the
higher
education
technical
amendments
must
be
given
effect,
even
though
congress
may
not
have
foreseen
all
of
its
consequences.
we
do
not
decide
whether
the
social
security
act’s
express
reference
provision
is
valid.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
