but
mr.
wolfman
tells
us,
ms.
blatt,
that
this
clause
is
not
quite
as
sweeping
as
you
suggest,
the
clause
in
the
1991
act,
and
points
specifically
to
provisions
that
say,
"no
other
provision
of
law
enacted
before,
on,
or
after.
"
the
picture
we're
given
of
the
1991
act
is
that
up
until
1991,
whatever
exists
up
until
1991,
there's
no
time
limitation,
but
that
this
1991
statute
does
not
speak
to
subsequently
enacted
statutes.
