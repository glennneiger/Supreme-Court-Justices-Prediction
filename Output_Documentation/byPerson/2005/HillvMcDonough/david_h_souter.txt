justice
david
h.
souter
may...
just
as
a...
maybe
this
is
technical,
but
what
did
you
ask
for
for
relief?
did
you
ask
for
relief
that
the
state
be
enjoined
from
using
this
method,
or
that
the
state
be
enjoined
from
executing
him
until
an
acceptable
method
had
been
found?
because
in
the
first
case,
the
door
theoretically
is
open
to
seriatim
1983
actions,
and
in
the
second
case,
presumably
the
issue
would
be
resolved
in
this
one
case,
as
you
suggest.
so
which
did
you
ask
for?
injunction
against
this
or
injunction
until
an
acceptable
alternative
came
up?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's...
if
that's
the
relief
you
get,
then
the
door
would
be
open
to
successive
different
1983
actions
every
time
the
state
comes
up
with...
with
a
new
protocol.
whereas,
if
what
the...
if...
if
the
trial
court...
if
you
succeed
at
this
stage,
if
we
say,
yes,
you're...
you're
properly
in
court
and
you
go
ahead
and
litigate
it,
if
the
trial
court,
in
fact,
awards
not
the
injunction
that
you
asked
for
but
the
injunction
saying
do
not
execute
this
person
until
a
constitutional
protocol
has
been
proposed
and
accepted
by
the
court,
then
everything
will
get
resolved
in
this
one
action,
as
you
suggest.
so
would...
would
you
consent
to...
as
it
were,
to
an
amendment
of
your
prayer
for
relief
so
that
the
injunction
will
be
in
such
a
form
that
everything
can
get
resolved
in
this
one
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
would
agree
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
when
did
you
ask
for
the
public...
when
did
you
ask
for
the...
a...
a
statement
of
the
protocol
that
would
be
used
in
your
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
may...
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
one
thing?
i
take
it,
at
this
point,
there
isn't
any
question
about
the...
the
amounts
and
ingredients
that
will
be
used
in...
if...
if
the
execution
goes
forward.
but
my
recollection
is
that
you
said
that
your...
your
request
for
a
specification
of
this
formula
or
protocol
was
denied
by
florida.
did
you
ever,
as
a
result
of
your
records
request
or
otherwise,
get
a
statement
directly
from
florida
to
you
that
the
following
proportions
of
chemicals
will
be
used?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
until
you
went
into
that
proceeding,
i
take
it,
you
had
asked
florida
to
specify
and
florida
said,
no,
it
would
not
do
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
did...
did
you
ever
say
to...
to
any
florida
official,
please
tell
me
what
the
chemicals
are
and
the
amounts
that
will
be
used--
justice
david
h.
souter
--not
asking
for
records,
just
asking
for
a
statement
about
what
they
were
going
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
guess
before
you
went
into
court
with
a
public
records
action,
did
you
ever
say
to
somebody,
tell
us
what
you're
going
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
i'm
getting
at
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there...
there
are
ways
to
find
out.
one
would
be
to
ask.
one
would
be
to
chop
the
door
down
with
an
ax
to
find
out
if
there's
a
statement
hidden
inside.
did
you
ever
try
the
easy
way
and
simply
say
to
them,
will
you
specify
for
us
what
you're
going
to
do
and
how
you're
going
to
do
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
source
of
his
obligation
to
do
this?
i
mean,
why
does
he
have
an
obligation
under
the
eighth
amendment
or
under
any
other
ground
to
tell
the
state
how
to
execute
people?
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
that
was
a
fact
in
nelson,
but
my
question
to
you
is
if...
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
and
say
that
that,
in
fact,
is
a...
is
an
element
of
a
1983
action
here,
what
would
be
the
source
of...
of
the...
the
conclusion
that...
that
he
has
to
propose
a
less
painful
alternative?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
i
mean,
that's
not...
that's
not
the
issue.
i'm
not
asking
you
about
res
judicata.
i'm
saying
that
if
he
comes
into
court
and,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested
in
her
hypo,
his
experts
demonstrate
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
fact
finder
that
there
will,
in
a
certain
number
of
cases,
be
excruciating
pain,
and
he
is
at
least
within
the
risk
of
that,
your
response
is
we're
still...
that
is
no
grounds
for
enjoining
the
execution
under
1983.
we
can
still
execute
unless
he
comes
up
with
a
proposal
for
a
less
painful
way
of
doing
it.
and
what
i
want
to
know
is,
why
does
he
have
such
an
obligation?
why
isn't
it
enough
to
show
that
there
is
a
probability
that
he
will
suffer
excruciating
pain?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
was
mentioned...
it
was
mentioned
in
nelson.
but
what
would
be
the
reason
for...
for
elevating
that...
that
fact
in
nelson
to
a
requirement?
what
is
the
legal
principle
that
would
support
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
there...
is
there
in
this
case?
i
mean,
the
lancet
article
has
been
out
there
for
a
while,
and
it
certainly
is
enough
to
suggest,
in
your
words,
that
there
is
something
problematic
about
the
manner
in
which
florida
proposes
to
do
this.
and
yet,
we
have
not
heard
a
word
that
florida
has
made
any
effort
whatsoever
to
find
an
alternative
or,
for
that
matter,
to...
to
disprove
what
the
lancet
article
suggests.
and
so
it's
one
thing
for
you
to
say
the
states
have
discretion.
i
don't
think
that
answers
justice
kennedy's
question
as
to
why
the
state
does
not
have
an
obligation
to
fulfill
its
constitutional
duty
to
execute
without
gratuitous
pain.
and
i
don't
see
why
you
have
given
any
answer
to...
to
the
proposal
that
that
obligation
requires
the
state
to
do
some
investigation
of
it's
own.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
understand
your...
your
argument
to
be...
and
i
don't
think
you're
making
it
here,
but
i
understood
your
argument
elsewhere
to
be
we
knew
about
sims,
but
when
they
stonewalled
us
and
said
we
won't
tell
you
what
we're
going
to
use,
we
had
reason
to
question
whether
they
were
going
to
follow
sims.
isn't...
isn't
that
your
point?
