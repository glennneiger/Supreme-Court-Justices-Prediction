justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
clarify
one
thing
for
myself?
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
federal
district
court...
i'm
not
talking
about
the
state
court...
did
not
rule
on
the
merits
of
your
claim,
but
merely
held
that
1983
is
not
the
proper
method
of
pursuing
the
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
there
hasn't
been
a
decision
by
a
federal
judge
on
whether
or
not
there's
merit
to
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
just
a
question
of
which...
whether
you
do
it
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
or
by
1983.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
suppose
it's
entirely
possible
that
if
the
judge
then
decided
it
is
really...
if
we
said
it
should
have
been
a
1983
action,
the
judge
could
say,
well,
okay,
even
under
1983
the
state
has
the
defense
of
laches
and
you
still
lose.
i
mean,
you...
we
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
if
we
find
out...
if
we
agree
with
what
your
argument
in
this
court
is.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
there
evidence
in...
i
noticed
the
brief
filed
by
some
veterinarians
call
our
attention
to
the
statute
that
prohibits
the
euthanasia
of
dogs
and
cats
unless
they
follow
a
certain
procedure.
so
there
must
have
been
a
legislative
feeling
that
unless
that
procedure
were
followed,
there's
a
risk
of
undue
pain
to
the
dogs
and
cats.
why
isn't
there
a
similar
basis
for
believing
that
if
you
don't
follow
a
similar
procedure
that
such
a
risk
might
be
present
for
human
beings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what's
your
response
to
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
procedure,
if
i
understand
it,
would
be
prohibited
to
be
applied
to
dogs
or
cats.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
at
least
it
was
sufficiently
convincing
to
get
the
florida
legislature
to
pass
a
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except...
let
me
just
interrupt.
supposing
he
did
identify,
say
you
can
only
use
pentobarbital
on
me,
the
same
way
they
do
it
for
a
veterinarian.
and
the...
and
the
judge
says,
well,
i
don't
think
that's
required.
but
he
would
then
be
satisfied
the
1983
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
saying
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
agree
if
he
had
said
i
propose
alternative
x,
even
though
it's
highly
unlikely
the
state
will
accept
it,
that
would
make
it
a
1983
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
there's
no
functional
difference
in
terms
of
future
litigation
between
that
case
and
this.
