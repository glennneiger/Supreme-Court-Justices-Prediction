justice

scalia
which
you
decline
to
specify.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
a
means
which
you
decline
to
specify,
so
that
if
they
come
up
with
some
other
means,
you
could...
you
could
object
to
that
as
well
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
just...
i'm
just
pointing
out
what...
what
becomes
available
to
you
if
we...
if
we
give
you
the
relief
you
request.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
we...
we
say
this...
this
procedure
is
no
good.
the
state
comes
up
with
another
procedure,
and
you
challenge
that
one.
right?
and...
and
another
few
years
go
by.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
think
that
the...
the
way
you
would
proceed
in
trial
court
is
the
trial
court
finds
that
this
is
no
good,
and...
and
then
the
trial
court
proposes
an
alternative,
or...
or
invites
the
state
to
propose
to
the
trial
court
an
alternative,
and
then
asks
whether
you
agree
to
that
alternative.
and
if
you
don't,
the
trial
court
makes
the
decision
whether
the
alternative
is...
is
constitutional
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
very
case,
you're
saying
the
court
would...
would
rule
on
the
state's
proposed
alternative.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
disagreed
with
that,
you
could
appeal
it
up
again.
right?
you
can
go
to
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
then
seek
cert
up
here.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
only
excruciating
pain
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits
or
is
it
any
pain?
does
the
eighth
amendment
require
painless
execution?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
when
you
say
wanton
and
gratuitous,
you're...
you're
saying
any
pain
that
can
be
eliminated
must
be
eliminated.
otherwise,
it's
gratuitous
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
so
if
there's
any
way
of...
of
execution
that
is
totally
painless,
that...
that
must
be
pursued.
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
do
you
derive
that
from?
i
mean,
gee,
you
know,
that...
that
was
certainly
never
the
principle
evident
in...
in
executions
in
the
past.
hanging
was...
was
not
a...
you
know,
a
quick
and
easy
way
to
go.
you
would
have
thought
they
would
have
required
a
firing
squad
instead
or
something
like
that.
i...
i
just
don't
know
where
you're
deriving
this
principle
that
there
cannot
be
any
pain
associated
with
the
execution.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
excruciating
pain,
but...
but
you...
you
want
to
press
it
to
the
point
where
there
can't
be
any
pain
associated.
any
pain
that
can
be
eliminated
must
be
eliminated.
that
seems
to
me
a
very
extreme
proposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
understand
what
you're
challenging
here.
but
what...
what
alternative
would
be
acceptable
to
you?
only
one...
only
one
that...
that,
to
the
maximum
extent
possible,
eliminates
all
pain.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but...
but
you...
you...
their
procedure
was
set
forth
in
a...
in
a
notice,
a
regulation
or
something.
you...
you
had
notice
of
what
procedure
they
intended
to
use
several
years
ago,
didn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you're
saying
they
could
change
it
in
the
future,
but
sure,
of
course.
any...
any
agency
can
change
its...
its
regulations.
but
didn't
you
know
that
this
is
the
procedure
they
intended
to
use
several
years
ago?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
wait
to...
you
have
to
wait
to
the
eve
of
execution
before...
before
you
think
you
have
a...
a
ripe
claim
under...
under
habeas.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
has
the
complete
discretion
to
change
the
statutes
it's
enacted,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
change...
you
can't
challenge
a
statute
now
because
it
might
be
changed
before...
before
the
action
you
want
to
take
occurs.
you
can
challenge
it
now.
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
same
thing
with
the
method
of
execution
prescribed
by...
by
an
administrative
agency
in...
in
a
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
how
did
you
get
into
the
court
if
you
didn't
know
what
protocol
they
were
going
to
use?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
you
didn't
know
it
until
the
19th
when
your
case
was
already
in
the
court.
what...
what
were
you
challenging?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
how
did
the
trial
court
get
into
it?
does
the
records
request
go
through...
through
a
trial
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
is
the...
the
action
that
you're
bringing?
an
action
for
records
request?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
still
do,
but
you're
here.
i
mean,
they...
they
still
have
the
opportunity
to
change
it,
but
you're
here
challenging
it
even
though
it
is
still
changeable.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
that...
that...
in
which
case
it
would
be
like...
like
heck.
right?
it
would
come
within
the
heck
principles.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't...
i
didn't
get
your
explanation.
had
you
finished
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
that's
the
research
they
would
do.
i
think
the
research
they
would
do
would
be
to
come
up
with
another
method
that
the
state
certainly
would
not
find
acceptable,
thereupon,
rendering
it
a
1983
action
and...
and
leaving
everything
in
the
same
status
that
it's...
that
it
is
here.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
that
you've
accomplished
anything
by
simply
demanding
that
they...
that
they
come
up
with
an
alternative.
they're
going
to
come
up
with
a...
with
an
unacceptable
alternative.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
might
be
malpractice
not
to
come
up
with...
with
an
unacceptable
alternative.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we've...
we've
never
held
that
anyway,
have
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
the
state
must,
in...
in
imposing
the
death
penalty,
use
a
method
that
inflicts
the
least
amount
of
pain.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose...
suppose
they
did
set
it
forth
but
reserved
the
right
to
change
it.
they
promulgated
a
regulation
without
public
notice,
without
hearings
or
anything.
this
is
our
regulation.
this
is
how
we
intend
to
conduct
executions
in
the
future.
period.
we
reserve
the
right
to
change
this.
would
you
claim
that...
that
this
was
not
ripe?
you
couldn't
challenge
it
at
that
point--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
they
could
change
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
this
is
the
current
method
that
we
intend
to
use
in
all
future
executions.
period.
we
may
change
our
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't...
don't
you
think
you...
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
you
think
effectively
had
that
knowledge
when
you
knew...
knew
about
sims
and
you
knew
about
all
of
the
cases
after
sims?
is
that
very
much
short
of...
of
their
saying
this
is
the...
the
procedure
we
intend
to
use?
