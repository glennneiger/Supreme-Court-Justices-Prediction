m.

well,
do
you
have
confidence--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
you
have
confidence
that
florida
can
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
one...
one
of
the
circumstances
that...
that
was
raised
by
the
questioning
is
this.
states
generally
have
the
defense
of
laches.
they...
they
require
the
petition
to
be
filed
within
a
reasonable
time.
with
changes
in
pharmacology,
the
laches
defense
will
not
usually
be
available.
and
under
the
proposal
that
the...
the
state
resolves
it
once
and
for
all,
i
suppose
the
state
couldn't
adopt
a
new
protocol
that
it
thought
was
better,
more
humane,
without
risking
more
litigation.
so
it...
it
really
is
a
disincentive
for
the
states
to
try
to
make
the
procedure
less
painful
for
the...
for
the
accused.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
precisely.
and
that's
going
to
be
true
with
every
new
protocol.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
souter
and
justice
ginsburg
can
protect
their
own
questions.
part
of
that
allegation
in
here
is
that
the
state
wasn't
forthcoming
with
the...
with...
with
the
information
requested,
and
you're
not
very
forthcoming
with
the
answers.
what
is
the
source,
what
is
the
legal
source,
what
is
the
precedent
for
the
proposition
that
the...
that
the
condemned
man
has
to
come
up
with
an
alternative?
what
case
do
you
cite?
what
principle
do
you
cite?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
we're
asking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this...
this
is
a
death
case.
it
was
not
that
amusing.
let
me
ask
you
this.
doesn't
the
state
have
some
minimal
obligation
under
the
eighth
amendment
to
do
the
necessary
research
to
assure
that
this
is
the
most
humane
method
possible?
doesn't
the
state
have
a
minimal
obligation
on
its
own
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
can
define
gratuitous...
i
don't
have
the
dictionary
here.
but
gratuitous
means
essentially
unnecessary.
if
there
were
other...
other
means,
other
alternatives,
that
might
be
used,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
might
have
some
minimal
obligation
to
investigate
those.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
know
it...
it
is
true
that
the
1983
is
a
civil
action,
and
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof,
burden
of
producing
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
might...
you
might
have
alleged
that...
that
you've
read
articles,
lancet
articles,
and
so
forth,
and
that
there
is
a
substantial
risk
that
they're
going
to
do
this.
i
think
that
might
suffice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
it
would...
it
would
mean
that
the...
as
the
chief
justice
indicates,
the
court
has
more
time
to
look
at
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
second
opinion
for
the
court
is
in
hill
versus
mcdonough,
no.
05-8794.
death-row
inmate
clarence
e.
hill
seeks
to
bring
an
eighth
amendment
challenge
to
the
sequence
of
drugs
florida
would
likely
use
to
execute
him
by
lethal
injection.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
hill
can
bring
his
challenge
pursuant
to
42
u.s.c.
1983
--
that’s
the
federal
statute
that
allows
individuals
to
sue
state
actors
for
violations
of
federal
rights
--
or
whether
he
must
seek
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
under
the
rules
and
conditions
set
forth
in
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996.
so
the
question
is
whether
or
not
he
must
proceed
under
section
1983
or
habeas
corpus.
the
question
of
which
of
the
two
statutes
governs
has
significance,
because
they
carry
different
restrictions
and
allow
different
forms
of
relief.
in
this
case,
hill
filed
a
suit
under
section
1983.
the
united
stated
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
florida
held
that
the
suit
was
the
equivalent
of
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
that
statute,
the
habeas-corpus
statute,
barred
hill’s
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
11th
circuit
affirmed,
and
we
now
reverse.
a
challenge
to
the
lawfulness
of
confinement
or
a
sentence
must
proceed
as
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
in
nelson
v.
campbell,
decided
in
2004,
the
court
addressed
an
inmate’s
eighth
amendment
claim,
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
that
was
a
challenge
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
sentence.
in
nelson,
the
inmate
challenged
an
invasive
surgical
procedure
the
state
planned
to
use
during
his
lethal-injection
execution.
this
court
held
that
the
suit
could
proceed
under
1983,
because
it
did
not
seek
an
injunction
that
would
bar
the
lethal
injection
itself.
the
procedure
the
state
proposed
to
use
was
not
mandated
by
law,
and
the
inmate
appeared
willing
to
concede
the
existence
of
an
acceptable
alternative
procedure.
we
conclude
today
that
hill’s
1983
action
is
controlled
by
our
decision
in
nelson.
the
particular
sequence
of
chemicals
hill
challenges
is
not
required
by
florida
law.
hill
concedes
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
alternative,
and
the
state
has
not
thus
far
contended
it
lacks
a
practical
legal
alternative.
one
concern
is
that
the
foregoing
analysis
may
be
more
theoretical
than
real.
the
states
and
its
amici
contend
that
the
law
must
recognize
how
inmates
file
suits
like
hill’s
only
to
forestall
execution.
to
address
this
concern,
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
proposes
that
we
deem
hill’s
suit
a
habeas
action,
because
he
has
not
offered
an
acceptable
alternative
procedure.
specific
pleading
requirements,
however,
are
mandated
by
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
not
through
case-by-case
determination
of
the
federal
courts.
as
for
other
arguments
made
by
the
respondents
and
state
amici,
they
are
foreclosed
by
the
controlling
decision
in
nelson.
our
conclusions
do
not
diminish
the
state’s
and
crime
victim’s
important
interests
in
the
timely
enforcement
of
a
sentence,
nor
do
they
deny
federal
courts
the
means
and
the
duty
to
protect
those
interests.
a
stay
of
execution
is
an
equitable
remedy;
it
is
not
available
as
a
matter
of
right.
courts
must
apply
a
presumption
against
granting
a
stay
where
a
claim
could
have
been
brought
in
time
to
consider
the
merits
without
delaying
the
sentence,
and
indeed
a
number
of
federal
courts
have
invoked
their
equitable
powers
to
dismiss
challenges
to
execution
procedures
they
saw
as
speculative
or
filed
too
late
in
the
day.
the
equities
and
merits
of
hill’s
actions
are
not
before
us,
however.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
this
opinion
is
unanimous.
