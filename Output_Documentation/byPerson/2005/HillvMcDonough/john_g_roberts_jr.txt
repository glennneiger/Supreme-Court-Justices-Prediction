chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
hill
v.
mcdonough.
mr.
doss.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
probably
will
be
what
will
be
alleged.
of
course,
you
don't
know
when...
at
this
proceeding,
we
have
no
idea,
if
we
rule
in
your
favor,
what
alternative
the
state
is
going
to
provide,
and
i
am
willing
to
bet
whatever
that
alternative
is
that
it
will
be
subject
to
a
challenge
under
a
new
1983
suit.
there
would
be
no
claim
preclusion
if
you
didn't
know
what
the
alternative
was
at
this
point.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
it
be...
if...
if
in
the
future,
if
states
specify
the
method
of
execution
in
the
sentence,
then
you
would
not
have
a
1983
action.
is
that
correct?
because
you
would
then
be
challenging
the
sentence,
and
it
would
have
to
be
brought
under
habeas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you...
you
alleged
in
your
complaint...
i'm
looking
at
footnote
3...
that
you
assumed
they
were
going
to
follow
the
same
protocol
as
in
sims.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
snurkowski,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
would
have
thought
your...
your
answer
to
the
line
of
questioning
earlier
was
that
the
reason
that
the
petitioner
has
to
come
with
this...
an
alternative
is
that
otherwise
it's
plausible,
at
least,
to
suspect
the
reason
he's
bringing
the
action
is
as
a
challenge
to
the
execution
itself
rather
than
the
particular
method.
and
that
if
it's
a
challenge
to
the
execution
itself,
it
has
to
be
brought
under
habeas.
if
it's
just
a
challenge
to
the
method,
it
can
be
brought
under
1983.
if
he's
unwilling
to
say
there
is
a
valid
method,
then
it
starts
to
look
like
a
challenge
to
the
execution
that
has
to
be
brought
under
habeas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shanmugam,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
presumably
there's
some
range
between
most
humane
and
what's
cruel
and
unusual.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
shanmugam,
several
of
the
emergency
death
proceedings
we've
had
involving
this
question,
the
district
court
judges
have
assumed
that
it
could
proceed
under
1983
but
then
denied
relief
because
it
was
brought
on
the
eve
of
execution,
as
this
one
was.
is
that
option
available
to
the
district
court
in
this
case
if
it's
sent
back?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
doss,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
there
was
adequate
time
for
the
district
court
to
fully
consider
the
evidence
you
intended
to
present
and
consider
your
claim
and
still
proceed
with
the
execution
that
was
scheduled?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
filed
your
case
4
days
before
the
execution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
sims
protocol
was
there
as
a
matter
of
public
domain.
you
said
in
your
complaint
yourself,
when
you
didn't
get
any
information,
you
said,
well,
i
assume
you're
going
to
follow
sims.
why
wasn't
that
assumption
valid
3
months
before,
6
months
before,
or
a
year
before?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
you
alleged
the
exact
opposite
in
footnote
3.
you
said
when
they
stonewalled
you,
we
assumed
they
were
going
to
follow
sims.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
