mr.
d.
todd
doss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
nelson
v.
campbell,
this
court
held
that
a
challenge
to
procedures
to
execute
an
inmate
may
be
brought
in
a
section
1983
action
unless
the
challenge
would
necessarily
prevent
the
state
from
carrying
out
its
execution.
mr.
hill
does
not
challenge
the
state's
right
to
execute
him
by
lethal
injection,
but
instead,
only
challenges
the
particular
protocol
the
florida
department
of
corrections
in
their
discretion
has
adopted.
mr.
hill's
claim,
thus,
does
not
necessarily
prevent
his
execution,
and
his
claim
falls
squarely
within
the
scope
of
nelson,
as
announced
by
this
court.
the
current
claim...
the
only
focus
of
that
claim
is
the
discretionary
choice
of
the
particular
injection
procedure
that
has
been
chosen
by
the
florida
department
of
corrections.
therefore,
it
does
not
violate
nelson
because
the
relief
sought
would
not
necessarily
prevent
the
state
of
florida
from
carrying
out
its
execution.
the
state
could
still
carry
out
the
execution
through
a
more
humane
means
by
offering
the
particular
protocol
that...
that
they
have
adopted.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
i'm
sorry,
justice.
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
your
question.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
well,
there...
in...
in
answer
to
your
question,
there's
never
been
a...
a
requirement
that
a
section
1983
plaintiff
must
plead
a
constitutionally
acceptable
alternative.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
well,
this--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--i...
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
fact
that
it
would
just
leave
open
a
total
series
of
challenges.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
the
state...
the
state
would
have
the
opportunity
to
come
in
and
propose
a
acceptable
alternative.
just
like
any
other
finding
of
unconstitutionality,
once
they
propose
that
alternative,
we
can
challenge
that
if
something
is...
is
not
acceptable,
or
accept
the...
the
proposed
alternative
and
the
court
enters
a...
a
consent
decree.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
this...
that's--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--that's
entirely
correct,
and
i
think
we've
seen
that
in...
in
a
couple
of
the
cases
that
are
out
there.
mr.
brown's
case
out
of
north
carolina
followed
that
track.
mr.
morales'
case
somewhat
followed
that
track,
although
through
no
fault
of
mr.
morales,
california
wasn't
able
to
carry
through
on
the
alternative
that
they
chose
because
the
anesthesiologists
decided
to
not
participate.
but
it...
but
it
just
proceeded
to
basically
an
up
or
down
ruling
upon
the
proposed
alternatives.
so
i...
i
would
disagree
that
there's
a
seriatim
effect
of...
of
just
perpetual
litigation
over
whether
the
alternatives--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--the
only...
the
only
way
i
would
foresee
a
second
episode
is
if
they...
if
they
proposed
a
second
unconstitutional
procedure.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
that's
correct,
although
it
would
proceed
to
basically
an
up
or
down
ruling,
just
as
it
did
in...
in
the
brown
case
and
the...
the
morales
case.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
that's
correct.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
that's
correct.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
that...
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
we
asked
for...
for
two...
two
injunctions,
one
a
preliminary
injunction
allowing
the...
the
court
to
be
able
to
consider
the
case,
and
then
the
way
the
prayer
for
relief
was
worded
is,
is
that
we
asked
for
a
permanent
injunction
barring
the
state
of
florida
from
executing
mr.
hill
as
they
currently
intend.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
in...
in
the
sense
of...
of
the
state
of
florida
proposing
a...
a...
hopefully
a
constitutional
way
of
executing--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--mr.
hill,
where
it
wouldn't
give
rise
to
another
1983
action?
mr.
d.
todd
doss
yes.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
yes.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
based
upon
the
litigation
that
we've
seen
around
the
country,
yes,
i
think
there
are
acceptable
ways
to...
to
do
it
out
there.
whether
they
would
choose
that
way
or
not,
i
don't
know
because
the
way
florida's
system
is
designed
is...
is
that
it's
not
statutorily
mandated
as
to...
as
to
a
particular
protocol
that's
utilized.
it's
left
totally
with
the
secretary
of
the
florida
department
of
corrections.
it's
not
subject
to
any
rulemaking
or
any
administrative
procedures
as
far
as
promulgating
those
rules.
it's...
it's
just
within
the
secretary's
discretion.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
well,
within...
within
the
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
of...
of
the
evolution
of...
of
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence,
we've
seen
hanging
go
by
the
wayside.
we've
effectively
seen
electrocution
go
by
the
wayside.
as
we
advance
as
a
society
and
as
we
advance
within
our
knowledge
of
what's
going
on--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--that's
an...
that's
an
evolution
over
time.
it's--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--in
mr.
brown's
case
in
north
carolina,
my
understanding
was...
is
that
the
state
had
went
and
purchased
a
device
to
make
sure
that
he
was
actually
unconscious
during
the
procedure
and
wasn't
subject
to
the
excruciating
pain
that's
been
detailed
within...
within
the
briefs.
that
actually
was
challenged
because
mr.
brown's
attorneys
didn't
think
that
the...
the
people
that
were
monitoring
the
machine
were
properly
trained.
the
court
ruled
against
them,
and
as
we
know,
mr.
brown
was...
was
executed.
it
didn't
result
in
the
series
of
challenges
as...
as
many
are
obviously
concerned
about.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
as
far
as
using
the
machinery
that
was
used
in
brown?
mr.
d.
todd
doss
i...
i
don't
know
enough
about...
about
that
machine
to...
to
accurately
comment
on...
on
that.
i
know
that
the
challenges
that
were
brought
in
brown
wasn't
necessarily
regarding
the
machine
itself,
but
it
was
the
qualifications
of...
of
the
people
monitoring
the
machine
and
whether
they
had
the
authority
and
ability
to
intervene
in
the
execution
itself.
and
i
believe
that
that
was
the
challenge
that
was
ruled
upon
by
the
court
in
mr.
brown's
case
before
he
was
executed.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
as
far
as...
as
far
as
this
particular
protocol,
this
particular
protocol
that's...
that's
utilized
and
that
we're...
we're
challenging
is
unconstitutional
because
of
the
excruciating
pain.
if
the...
if
the
sedative
works,
and
there's
no...
and...
and
the
person
is
not
in...
not
in
wanton
and
gratuitous
type
of...
of
pain,
as...
as
this
court's
precedents
hold,
that
would
be
constitutional.
it's
the...
it's
the
evidence
that's
coming
forward
that
this
is
not
what's
happening
that
gives
rise
to
our
claim
that...
that
we
would
like
to
be
able
to
litigate
in
a
1983
action
so
that
we
can
get
those
facts
before
the
court.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
no,
absolutely
not.
it's...
it's
that
it's...
it's
that
it's
wanton
and...
and
gratuitous
pain.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
it's...
it's
gratuitous
when
it's
beyond
what's...
what's
necessary,
and
whenever
the--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--if
there
were
a
way
to
do
that,
i...
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
i--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--the...
the...
what...
what
we've
detailed
here
in
our
complaint
is
an
extreme
and
tortuous
method
of...
of
death.
at
this
point--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--well,
when
you
look
at
the...
when
you
look
at...
at
morales
and
brown,
both
of
those
that...
that
were
proposed
were
eliminating...
for
instance,
one
of
the
options
within
mr.
morales'
case
was
that
only
the
sodium
thiopental
be
used
eliminating
the
pancuronium
bromide
and
the
potassium
chloride.
the
state
of
california,
for...
for
whatever
reason,
did
not...
did
not
choose
that
and
went,
instead,
and
tried
to
use
the
same
protocol
and
bring
in
anesthesiologists
that
were
properly
trained
and
qualified
to
determine
whether
or
not
mr.
morales
was,
in
fact,
anesthetized
to...
to
a
degree
where
he
would
not
feel
that
pain.
that...
that
is...
that
is
an
example
of
a
proper
procedure
being...
being
come
up
with...
or
being
dealt
with.
as
well,
mr.
brown...
and...
and
thing
is,
is
that
for...
there's...
there's
never
been
a
requirement
for...
for
us
to
plead
this.
the
reason
being
is...
is
this
court's
case
law
within...
for
example,
lewis
v.
casey
shows
the...
the
strong
deference
that
this
court
gives
to
states
in...
in
coming
up
with
the
prison
procedures.
that's
not
an
execution
case,
but
here
the
florida
courts...
not
florida
courts,
but
the
florida
officials
within
the
department
of
corrections...
they
know
their
facilities.
they
know
what's
capable
of...
of
being
done
there
or
not.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
if
the
particular
protocol
was
alleged
in
the
sentence,
yes,
it
would
be
ripe
at
that
point
in
time
as
opposed
to
florida's
system
where
it's
within...
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
department
of
corrections
to
change
it
at
any
time.
we've
seen
that
happen
whenever
the
electric
chair
litigation
was
going
on,
that
they
changed
these
procedures
over
time,
adding
and
detracting
different
things.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
the
only--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--no,
your
honor.
it
was...
what
they
relied
upon
was
what
was...
what
was
detailed
in
sims,
which
was
6
years
ago.
but
with
the...
with
the
discretion
that
florida
department
of
corrections
has
and
that
they've
exhibited
in
the
past,
that
they've
utilized
that
discretion
whenever
we
were
having
the
electric
chair
litigation
going
on,
we
can't
presume
that.
the
added
problem
is--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--under...
under
florida's
scheme,
yes,
we
have
to
wait
because
they
have
the
complete
discretion.
we
have
no
access
to
be
able
to
get
the
public
records.
in
fact,
we've
been
denied
throughout.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
if
congress
has
the
situation
set
up
that
florida
does
not
engage
in...
in
rulemaking.
they
don't
go
through
an
orderly
administrative
process,
taking
public
input
and
having
people
come
and
participate
in
that.
it's
totally--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--because...
because
that
claim
was
not
ripe
at
that
time,
because
we
didn't
know
what
would
be
utilized
whenever
it
came
to
mr.
hill
being
executed.
our
knowledge
as
to
how
florida
department
of
corrections
utilizes
that
discretion
has
been
that
they
actually
used
that
discretion
in
the
past.
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
any
records
post
sims
regarding
their
procedures,
regarding
the
protocol--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--i
don't
have
any
public
records
to...
to
be
able
to
say
one
way
or
another.
we
were
denied
all
public
records
whenever
we
were
proceeding
in
state
court.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
it
was
december
the
8th
is
whenever
it
began,
and
then
pursuant
to
the
court's...
the
trial
court's
order
that
was
entered
in
that
case,
the
state's
response
came
on
december
19th.
the
court
ruled
on
december
23rd.
the
rehearing
was
denied
on
the
30th,
and
we
filed
our
briefs
in
the
florida
supreme
court
on
january
3rd.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
once--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--what
we...
what
had
happened
is...
is
whenever
the...
whenever
the
death
warrant
was
signed
on
november
29th,
that
put
into
play
florida
rule
of
criminal
procedure
3.852(h)(3)
which
then
entitles
us
to
more
records
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
before
a
warrant
is
signed.
at...
at
that
point,
we
filed
our
records
request,
and
the
trial
court,
indeed,
put
forth
their
order
as
to
when
everybody
was
to
respond
and
have
various
pleadings
in.
we--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--yes.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
yes.
it's
under
florida
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
it's
geared
specifically
to
death
sentenced
individuals
as
opposed
to
being...
we
don't
have
available
what's
under
florida
statute.
chapter
119
is
not
available
to
a
death
sentenced
inmate.
so
we
must
proceed
through
the
3.852
procedures,
and
that
was
not
activated
until
the
point
in
time
that
the
warrant
was
actually
signed.
we
filed
other
pleadings
in
the
court
that
were
denied
regarding
mental
retardation,
regarding
a
roper
claim,
and
various
other...
other
claims.
ultimately,
we
also
filed
in
regards
to
the
public
records
claim
and
us
being
denied
the
public
records
and
the
ability
to
assess
the
protocol.
florida--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--within
the...
within
the
public
records
proceeding,
it
was
referenced
that
it
would
be
the
same
as...
as
sims.
florida
department
of
corrections--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--we
had
asked
for
the
records
and
had
requested
the
records
that
would
specify
and
any
written
procedures
and
protocol,
as
well
as
the
records
from...
from
prior
executions.
they
fought
that
and
prevailed
in
the
trial
court.
and
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
we
had
also
sought
records
from
the
medical
examiner
that
does
the
autopsies
on
executed
individuals,
as
well
as
various
other
officials
we
thought
might
have
information.
we
were...
we
were
given
nothing
and
they
objected
to
us
receiving
any
records
whatsoever.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
we--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--it...
it
came
forward
at
the...
at
the
hearing
regarding
the
public
records
that
it
was
going
to
be
the
sims...
that
it
was
going
to
be
the
sims
procedure.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
by
our
public
records
request,
yes.
if...
if
your
honor
is
asking
if
i
spoke
to
the--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--department
of
corrections,
no.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
that
was
essentially
done
at
the
public
records
hearing
on
december
19th
whenever
they
came
in
and
said
it
was...
that
it
was
sims.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
the...
the
thing
is,
is--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--because
of
their...
because
of...
of
the
representations
that
were
made
during
the
public
records
litigation.
that
was
based
upon...
that
was
what
we
based
our
assumption
on,
knowing
that
they
still
had
the
ability
to
change
it
all
the
way
up
until
the
date
that
mr.
hill
was
scheduled
to
be
executed.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
they...
yes.
because
of
the
way
florida
operates
with
the
total
discretion
and...
and
the
refusal
to
give
any
public
records
regarding
this,
yes,
we
are
in
the
dark
regarding
it.
they
could...
they
could
alleviate
that
situation
by
doing
an
administrative
rulemaking
process,
that
that
rule
is
then
in
place,
and
with
that
rule
in
place,
it
would
be
ripe
at
that
point
because
at
that
point
they're
constrained
to
follow
the
rule
as
opposed
to
having
the
liberty
to...
to
change
the
procedures
as
they...
as
they
deem
fit
at
the
last
minute.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
that's
correct.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
that
is
correct.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
that
is...
that
is
correct,
and
it
was
recharacterized
as...
as
a
successive
habeas
petition
rather
than
a
1983
action.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
it
would
go
back
for...
for
an
analysis
as
to
the
equities
of
the
situation,
and...
and
that
being
an
intensely
fact
bound
procedure,
the
district
court
is
actually
in...
in
a
better
position
to
go
ahead
and...
and
be
able
to
make
that
analysis
there
at
the
district
court
level,
a
gomez
analysis
as
to
the
equities
that
are
involved
within
the
situation.
so
as...
as
we
sit
here
today,
there
has
not
been
any
ruling
on
the
merits
of...
of
this,
and
there
hasn't
been
any
evidence
produced
in...
in
any
court
through
testimony
whatsoever
regarding
the
issues
of
the
protocol
and...
and
things
of...
of
that
nature
that
we've
been
discussing
here
this
morning.
and
i
think
that...
that
whenever...
whenever
you...
you
look
at...
actually
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
more
questions,
i'm
going
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
that
is
true.
that
is
true,
and
we
would
be
prepared
to
do
that
if
we
were
allowed
to
go
back
and...
and
proceed.
we
have
produced
evidence
at
the...
at
the
pleadings
stage,
and
as
we
sit
here
today,
since
there
hasn't
been
an
answered
filed,
our...
our
pleadings
are...
are
accepted
as...
as
true
for...
as
a
matter
of
procedure.
the
interesting
thing
is,
is
that...
is
that
florida
created
this
problem.
they
can...
they
can
lay
it
out
as
to
how
to
euthanize
dogs
and
cats,
but
they
can't
do
it
for
humans.
that's
perfectly
in
the
open.
yet,
they
shroud
this
in
secrecy.
we
can't
get
public
records.
we
can't...
3.852(h)(3)
of
the
florida
code
of
criminal
procedure
prevents
us
from
going
and
getting
these
records
before--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--no.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
no,
but
we
were
put
in
that
posture
by...
by
the
way
the
state
of
florida
has
chosen
to...
to
vest
this
total
discretion,
shroud
everything
in
secrecy,
and
then
complain
that
we
didn't
bring
it
earlier
when
we--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--because
at
that
point,
i
knew
that
they
had
total
discretion.
i
knew
that
before
they
had
changed
their
protocols
when
the
electric
chair
litigation
was
going
on.
indeed,
the
florida
legislature
changed
the
entire
statute
when
this
court
accepted
mr.
bryant's
case--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--that--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--as
far
as...
as
far
as
the...
the
ripeness
issue,
it's
not...
because
of
the
way
florida
chose
to
do
their
procedure,
it
was
not
ripe,
and
it
doesn't
comport
with
this
court's
basic
ripeness
doctrine
that
we
are
going
to
presume
it's
going
to
be
done
a
certain
way
when
the
state
can
come
in
and
say,
it's
not
ripe
for
review,
we...
we
still
have
the
ability
to
change
this
rather
than
us
coming--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--if
they...
if
they
never
told
us,
i
guess
we
would
be
in...
in
a
position
of...
of
assuming
sims
is
in
place.
but
the
thing
is,
is
that
it's
an
equitable...
it's
an
equitable
argument.
and
florida
is
not
coming
forward
with
clean
hands.
they
created
this
and
then
they
just
want
to
say,
well,
you
should
have
known.
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
to
help
you.
we're
going
to
shroud
this
in
secrecy
and
not
tell
anybody.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
at
that--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--if
your
honor...
if
your
honor's
fact
situation
includes
a
presumption
that
that's
going
to
be
the
presumption
that
that's
going
to
be
the
presumed
method,
i
think
at
that
point,
yes--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--at
that
point,
yes,
because
they...
they
are
stating
that
they
intend
upon
using
that
rather--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--rather
than
playing
hide
the
ball.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
absolutely
not.
we
only
knew
about
sims.
we
asked
for
records
regarding
all
the
executions
since
sims.
we
have
not
received
it.
mr.
d.
todd
doss
yes,
and
that
only
came
into
play
at
the
point--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--they
stonewalled
us
only
after
the
warrant
was
signed
because
we
couldn't
do
anything
at...
at
the
point
before
the
warrant
was
signed
to
be
able
to
try
to...
to
gather
evidence
as
to
what
it
was
going
to
be.
and
we
were
never--
mr.
d.
todd
doss
--we
were
never
told
that.
and
because
the
way
florida
has
created
their
system,
we
were
prevented
from
doing
that.
thank
you.
