mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
where
a
prisoner
challenges
a
particular
method
of
execution
but
fails
to
identify
a
permissible
alternative,
that
claim
is
functionally
equivalent
to
a
claim
challenging
the
prisoner's
death
sentence
per
se
and
therefore
must
be
brought--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
our
view
is
that
the
heck
principle
is
not
applicable
here
where
a
prisoner
is
seeking
relief
that
is
indisputably
available
in
habeas.
our
view
is
that
the
governing
precedent
and
really
the
touchstone
here
is
this
court's
decision
in
preiser
v.
rodriguez,
which
drew
the
distinction
that
the
court
has
long
recognized
between
claims
challenging
the
conditions
of
a
prisoner's
confinement
and
claims
challenging
the
fact
or
duration
of
that
confinement.
now,
to
be
sure,
that
analogy
is
not
exactly
apt
in
the
capital
context.
but
we
believe
that
where
a
prisoner
identifies
a
permissible
alternative,
it
is
that
which
renders
the
claim--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
we
do
believe
that
where
a
prisoner
brings
an
open
ended
claim
of
the
type
at
issue
here,
it
would
necessarily
prevent
the
state
from
carrying
out
the
execution
in
one
relevant
sense.
namely,
it
would
prevent
the
state
from
carrying
out
the
execution--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that's
exactly--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
no,
i
don't
think
that
that's
true,
and
i
do
think
that
the--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--no.
i
think
that
the
cold
cell
case
clearly
is
a
conditions
of
confinement
claim.
and
let
me
explain
to
you,
justice
breyer,
if
i
may,
the
reason
that
the
identification
of
an
alternative
is
so
critical.
it
is
the
identification
of
an
alternative
that
renders
the
claim
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
conditions
of
confinement
claim
because
a
conditions
of
confinement
claim
is
really
necessarily
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
the
prisoner
will
continue
to
serve
exactly
the
same
sentence,
even
if
the
claim
is
successful.
in
your
hypothetical,
if
a
prisoner
claims
that
his
cell
is
too
cold,
the
necessary
implication
is
that
the
prisoner
will
be
able
to
continue
to
be
imprisoned
at
some
higher
temperature,
even
if
the
prisoner
does
not
specify
in
his
complaint
that
he
wants
to
be
held
at
70
degrees
or
72
degrees.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
identification
of
the
alternative
is
so
important.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
in
nelson,
it
was
important,
and
we
would
submit
that
it
was
really
the
dispositive
factor
in
the
court's
analysis.
the
court
noted
the
fact
that
the
state
had
conceded...
the
prisoner
had
identified
and
the
state
had
conceded
that
an
alternative
method
could
be
used
to
administer
the
execution.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes.
[laughter]
let
me
try...
let
me...
let
me
try
again
through
a
different
route,
though.
where
a
prisoner
fails
to
identify
an
alternative,
the
risk
here
is
that
such
a
claim
could
delay
and
may,
in
fact,
prevent
the
ultimate
execution
of
the
death
sentence.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
in
that
case,
he
may
very
well
have
a
valid
eighth
amendment
claim.
but
our
principal
submission--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--is
that
he
cannot
proceed
in
a
section
1983
action.
presumably
what
would
happen--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
again,
the
concern
with
the
claim
that
fails
to
identify
a
permissible
alternative
is
the
risk
of
seriatim
litigation.
and
i
think
that
the
history
not
only
of
the
nelson
case,
but
also
of
some
of
the
ongoing
litigation,
most
notably
the
morales
case
in
california,
demonstrates
that
that
risk
is
a
very
real
one.
where
a
prisoner
fails
to
identify
an
alternative
method,
it
is
not--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
the
state
would
at
least
have
the
option
in
that
case--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--of
acquiescing
in
the
alternative.
the
state
would,
of
course,
have
the
option
of
saying
no
and
litigating
it.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
that
would
make
it
a
1983
action.
and
the
critical
point,
as
this
court
recognized--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
the
only
reason
that
there
would
be
no
functional
difference
is
if
the
state
chose
to,
in
fact,
litigate
the
issue,
notwithstanding
his
identification
of
the
permissible
alternative.
and
in
nelson--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
would...
i
would
respectfully
submit,
justice
breyer,
that
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
research
that
they
would
have
to
do
in
order
to
bring
the
claim
in
the
first
place.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
the
alternative
at
a
minimum
has
to
be--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--at
a
minimum,
the
alternative
has
to
be
one
that
is
permissible
under
currently
government--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that
would
not...
presumably
that
would
not
be
a
method
of
execution
at
all.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i'm
not
sure
whether
it...
it
would
have
an
obligation
to
use
the
most
humane
method
under
the
eighth
amendment
because
this
court's
cases
have
only
suggested
that
the
gratuitous
infliction
of
pain
is
barred
by
the
eighth
amendment.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
more
broadly,
justice
kennedy,
that
one
reason
that
states
do
have
discretion
in
this
area...
and
i
think
that
florida
is
not
unusual
in
that
regard...
is
that
prison
officials
are
expected
to
adopt
to
evolving
methods
of
execution
and
to
take
into
account
changes
that
might
suggest
that
a
particular
method
is
problematic.
and
so
whether
or
not
there
is
a
constitutional
obligation,
i
think
that
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
states
will,
in
fact,
do
that.
i
think
that
it
is
noteworthy--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
whether
or
not
the
state
has
that
obligation...
it
may
very
well
have
that
obligation
as
a
constitutional
matter,
but
putting
that
to
one
side,
it
does
seem
as
if
the
critical
question
is
whether
or
not
the
state,
in
fact,
has
adopted
a
method
that
inflicts
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
and
where
a
prisoner
has
a
claim
of
that
variety,
a
prisoner
has
other
options
if
the
prisoner
is
unwilling
to
identify
a
permissible
alternative
to
bring
that
claim
besides--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--and
the
court
has
never
held
that.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
court
has
not
held
that.
instead,
it
has--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
presumably
true,
based
on
the
formulations
that
this
court
has
used
which
have
repeatedly
focused
on
the
gratuitous
or
wanton
infliction
of
pain
as
opposed
to
the
least
painful
method.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
it
is
available
to
the
district
court,
and
indeed,
it
would
potentially
be
available
even
to
this
court
as
a
matter
of
first
instance
as
it
was
in
the
gomez
case.
thank
you.
