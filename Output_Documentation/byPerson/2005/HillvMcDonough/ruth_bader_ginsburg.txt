justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
envisioning
that
one
case
will
take
care
of
it.
that
is,
if
the
court
rules
against
you,
that's
the
end
of
it.
you
can't
come
back
with
another
inadequacy
because
you'd
be
barred
by
claim
preclusion.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
state
comes
up
with
an
acceptable
alternative,
you
agree
to
it.
that's
one
thing.
the
court
holds...
but
there
wouldn't
be
a
second
episode
i
think.
one
way
or
another
this
proceeding
would
end
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
said
there
were
other
states.
you
mentioned
california.
there
was
a
proposal
by
the
state.
it
couldn't
be
executed.
what
was
the
experience...
you
mentioned
a
couple
of
other
cases
where
the
particular
combination
of
drugs
was
successfully
challenged,
but
then
the
state
did
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
did
they
have?
there
was
the
sims
case.
no...
no...
certainly
not
in
the
legislation.
there's
no
rule
that
emerges.
but
you
did
know
that
there
was
a
lethal
injection
procedure
that
had
been
prescribed
for
another
prisoner,
and
yet
you
didn't
challenge
the
lethal
injection
at
that
time.
why
did
you
wait
until
so
late?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
they,
in
fact,
changed
the
procedure
for
the
lethal
injection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
no
statute
and
there's
no
regulation
that
requires
florida
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
no
statute,
no
regulation.
that
means
the
executive
can
do
what
it
will.
there's
nothing
that
binds
them
to
the
way
it
was
done
in
sims'
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
suppose
that's...
that's
the
complaint.
if
there
were
a
procedure
in
place,
we
could
address
it.
if
florida
reserves
to
itself
the
ability
to
change
at
any
time,
well,
that's...
we
want
to
be
told
what
it
will
be
in
our
particular
case
so
we
have
a
target
that
we
can
aim
at.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
he
have
to
come
up--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with,
as
you
suggest,
an
alternative
that
would
be
acceptable?
suppose
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
it
was
proved
more
probable
than
not
that
in
some
cases...
not
in
all,
but
in
some
cases...
use
of
this
injection
would
cause
excruciating
pain.
would
the
petitioner
who
is
objecting
being
exposed
to
that
have
to
come
up
with
an
alternative
in
order
to
avoid
the
risk
of
excruciating
pain?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
my
question
to
you
is...
i
take
it
you're
answering
yes,
that
if
they
prove
that
some
people
will
be
subject
to
excruciating
pain,
that's
not
good
enough
unless
the
petitioner
proposes
an
alternative,
that
it's
all
right
for
the
state
to
expose
someone
to
the
risk
of
what
has...
what
has
been
determined
to
be
the
risk
of
excruciating
pain
as
long
as
the
petitioner
himself
doesn't
come
up
with
an
alternative.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
because
there's
been
no
hearing.
we've
never
gotten
past
is
this...
can
you
open
the
door
through
1983,
and
i...
i
still
don't
understand
what
your
answer
is
to
my
question.
now,
i'm
supposing
that
we
do
have
the
1983
hearing,
and
the
judge
says,
yes,
i
agree
with
the
petitioner's
experts.
in
some
cases
there
will
be
excruciating
pain.
then
you
say,
but,
judge,
they
haven't
come
up
with
an
alternative.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
judge
says,
you're
both
right.
some
people
have
excruciating
pain,
but
there's
been
no
alternative
suggested.
bottom
line
of
that
particular
case
would
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court,
having
found
that
some
people
will
be
subject
to
excruciating
pain,
still
no
eighth
amendment
violation
because
the
petitioner
hasn't
come
up
with
an
alternative.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
risks
that
the
prisoner
will
die
an
excruciating
death?
i'm
asking
you
the
same
question
that
i
asked
cocounsel.
what
happens
then?
he
hasn't
been
able
to
come
up
with
an
alternative,
but
the
judge
finds
it
credible
that
he
may
be
exposed
to
an
excruciating
death.
what
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
not?
because
he's
saying
i
am
not
asking
for
this
to
be
one
day
further
along.
i'm
just
asking
the
state
to
give
me
a
death
that
will
not
require
me
to
suffer
excruciating
pain.
