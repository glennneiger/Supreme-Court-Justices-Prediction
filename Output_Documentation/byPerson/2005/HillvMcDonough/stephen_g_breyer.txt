justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
he...
i...
i
take
it
the
ripeness
issue
is...
he
delayed
in
bringing
it
because
he
wasn't
certain
what
you'd
do.
and...
and
one
of
the
reasons,
i
think,
would
be
that
it's
only
recently
there
was
an
article
in
the
lancet--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
says
the...
in
the
opinion
of
the
doctors
who
wrote
it,
a
significant
number
of
executed
people
are
conscious
when
they
die,
and
that's
painful.
and
then
it's
been
suggested
there
are
ways
around
that.
just
give
them
more
sodium
pentothal
or
have
a
doctor
or
somebody
there
to
make
certain
the
individual
is
unconscious
at
the
time
that
the
death
causing
drugs
take
effect.
all
right.
now,
that
doesn't
seem
too
difficult.
maybe
it's
difficult,
but
it
doesn't
seem
too
difficult.
so
why
can't
they
think,
you
know,
florida...
they
can
read
there
too.
they
have
people
who
read
these
articles,
and
indeed,
maybe
they'll
just
do
it.
they
don't
have
any
real
interest
in...
in
causing
suffering.
why
don't
they
just
do
it?
and
so
he
thinks,
up
until
the
last
minute,
that
maybe
florida
will
just
do
it,
and
lo
and
behold,
when
the
death
warrant
is
actually
executed,
it
now
begins
to
appear
that
they
won't.
and
therefore,
at
that
time,
he
brings
the
case.
now,
i've
spun
out
a
story
which
seems
probable,
that
if
it's
true,
it
would
be
very
understandable
why
this
wasn't
ripe
before
the
execution
warrant
is
issued
and
thereafter
it
is.
now,
what
is
your
reply
on
the
ripeness
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--my...
my
little
story
was
inaccurate
as
to
florida
or
accurate
as
to
florida.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
kind
of
thing
i
was
explaining
why
it
would
be
ripe
i
think...
is
that
accurate
enough
for
the
purposes
of
ripeness
as
to
what
happened
in
florida?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
respect
to
that
core
position,
i
can
understand
the
state's
concern
with
the
possibility
of
abuse.
but
in
nelson,
what
the
court
says
is
it
points
to
gomez,
and
gomez
was
a
1983
case.
and
there,
the
court
denied
a
stay
of
the
execution
because
it
looked
into
the
history
of
the
litigation,
and
they
said
that
this
particular
individual
had
done
just
what
worries
you,
though
in
a
somewhat
different
context.
he
kept
bringing
the
cases,
and
every
time,
you
know,
he'd
lose.
then
he'd
think
of
another
way
of
making
the
same
point,
and
in
your
context,
it
would
be
first
he
challenges
this
method
and
he
says
there
are
others
that
are
fine.
so
we
go
to
another.
then
he
challenges
that.
then
he
challenges
that,
always
at
the
very
last
minute.
so
there's
a
case
that
provides
a
weapon
if
the
abuse
that
you
worry
about
occurs.
so
why
do
we
need
something
else
like
an
absolute
rule
of
some
sort
that
the
petitioner
has
to
think
of
a
method
of
execution,
a
matter
on
which
he
is
not
necessarily
expert,
that
would
turn
out
in
the
future
to
be
not
painful?
i
mean,
you
don't
need
to
put
on
your
overcoat
and
also
turn
up
the
heat.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
got
the
case
that
helps
you
if
that
occurs.
why
do
you
need
to
argue
for
something
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
well,
why?
but
i
mean,
suppose
he
doesn't.
okay?
but
it's
absolutely
clear
he's
not
saying
all
methods
are
unconstitutional.
he's
saying
this
method
is
unconstitutional.
if
he
says
this
method
of
constitutional
and
he
wins,
then
his
challenge
will
not
necessarily
prevent
the
state
from
carrying
out
its
execution.
and,
of
course,
i'm
reading
to
you
directly
from
nelson
v.
campbell.
that
would
seem
right
in
point.
and
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
if
i
bring
a
claim
that
my
prison
cell
is
so
cold,
i
actually
get
pneumonia
and
die,
or
near
it,
and
then
i
challenge
the
coldness
of
the
cell,
i'm
preventing
my
confinement
in
one
particular
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
cold
cell.
and
so
that
would
similarly,
on
your
theory,
be
habeas,
but
we
know
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
cold
cell
case
is
habeas?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
more
than
in
nelson?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying...
saying
then
that
the
defense
bar,
the
capital
punishment
bar,
and
the
prisoners
are
the
group
of
people
that
have
to
go
and
do
the
research
on
humane
methods
of
putting
people
to
death
rather
than
the
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
strikes
me
as
a
little
odd,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
old
age.
they'll
come
with
that
alternative,
old
age.
right?
[laughter]
