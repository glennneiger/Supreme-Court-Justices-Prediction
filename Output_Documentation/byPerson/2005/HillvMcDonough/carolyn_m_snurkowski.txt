ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
state
is
here
today
to
suggest
that
the
method
that...
to
challenge
these
claims
is
by
habeas
corpus,
and
that
the
federal
district
court,
as
well
as
the
eleventh
circuit,
was
correct
in
finding
that
the
district
court
had
correctly
found
it
had
no
jurisdiction
because,
in
fact,
it
was
a
functional
equivalent
of
the
habeas
corpus.
but
to...
to
address
some
of
the
issues
that
were
currenntly
brought
before
the
court
today
with
regard
to
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
come
forward
and
discern
what
exactly
was
the
method
by
which
florida
was
intending
to
execute
him,
the
record
bears
out
that,
in
fact,
the
sims
case
was
in
the
public
domain
and,
in
fact,
is
the
method
by
which
florida
does
execute
individuals.
there
was--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--these...
there
is
no
specific
statute.
the
statute
itself
merely
says
that
lethal
injection
is
the
method
by
which
florida
is
to
execute
individuals.
the
department
of
corrections,
through
rulemaking
process
internally,
provides
protocols
for
the
execution
day
and
other
protocols
with
regard
to
the
execution
team
performing
its
function
on
that
given
day
and...
and
hours
leading
up
to
that.
and
that
has
not
been
changed
nor
modified,
nor
has
it
been
challenged--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--that
is
correct,
to
the
extent
that
there's
no
statutory
provision
or
regulatory
rule
because,
in
fact,
under
florida...
the
florida
legislature
has
exempted
rulemaking
of
the
department
of
corrections
with
regard
to
executions.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
and
i
understand
that,
but
the
state
would
contend
that
based
on
the
fact
that
there
have
16
executions
since
the
time
that
sims
has
occurred
and
all
those
executions
have
been
performed
exactly
as
the
manner
in
which
sims
has
occurred,
and
that
there
has
not
been
any
challenge
to
a
deviance
from
that,
and
in
fact,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
ratified
again
in
this
case,
when
mr.
hill
brought
his
eighth
amendment
claim,
that
sims
was
the
method
of
execution
in
florida,
i
think
we
have
a
very
reasoned
determination
that,
in
fact,
the
method
of
execution,
as
it
has
been
proposed
in
sims,
is
currently
the
method
of
execution
that
we
utilize.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
correct.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
my
reply
on
the
ripeness
question
is,
first
of
all,
that
i
don't
believe
that
your
scenario...
while
i'll
accept
your
scenario
as
your
scenario,
it
is
not
accurate
with
regard
to
what
occurred
in
florida.
but
apart
from
that,
there
has
not
been
a
change
and
nor
has
there
been
any
allegations
by
the
defendant.
he
certainly,
as
you
have
indicated,
could
have
read
and,
in
fact,
did
read
the
lancet
article
and
made
no
statements
with
regard
to
his
allegations--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no.
and
my
answer,
i
would
suggest
to
you,
is
no--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--because
i
think
it's
part
of
the
pleadings.
i
mean,
he
certainly
had
the
wherewithal.
if
he
felt
that
there
was
another
manner
by
which
it
could
have
been
changed
or
that
the
department
of
corrections,
in
this
particular
instance,
was
suddenly
going
to...
now
aware
of
the
lancet
article,
would
change
its
method,
he
has
not
made
any
allegations
of
that,
nor
has
he
asked.
and
that
was
one
of
the
questions
that
was
postulated
to
him,
the
fact
that
in...
that
he
never
asked.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
excuse
me.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
it
seems
to
me,
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
nelson,
that
that
was
the
focal
point
of
why
relief
was
granted
in
the
fashion
it
was,
that
it
was
a
proper
issue
to
rely
in
1983
because,
in
fact,
there
might
be
a...
he
had
proposed
a
mechanism
that
might
be
alternative
mechanism
that
was
accepted
by
the
government.
in
this
instance,
it's...
the
record
is
silent
and...
which
goes--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
i
think
the
answer
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
the
articles
out
there
reflect
that
there's
a
potential
that
that
could
happen,
there's
not
been
evidence
that
it
has
occurred
or
has
happened,
which
has
been
necessarily
what
is
the
precursor
to
when
there
has
been
changes
in
the
method
of
execution
because
there
has
been
a
history
where,
in
fact,
a
botched
execution
has
occurred
no
matter
what
the
method
may
have
been.
the
second
part
is
that
there
has
not
been
a...
a
specific
showing
in
this
particular
case,
nor
an
allegation
for
that
matter,
that
any
kind
of
event
in
this
particular
case
would,
in
fact,
cause
excruciating
or
any
kind
of
pain--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--correct.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that,
in
fact,
i
think
that
he
has
to
make
some
colorable
showing
of
an
alternative
that
would
be
acceptable
to
him
based
on
the
procedures
because,
again,
the
second
prong
of
that
seems
to
me--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
i
think
the
court
in
its
nelson
opinion
suggested
that
that
was
a
means--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
guess
part
of
the
source
would
be
the
fact
that
in
overcoming
the
qualifications...
while
maybe
his
pleading
may
be
simple,
the
notion
is
that
he
has
to
overcome
those
things
that
may
have
happened
in
the
past.
for
example,
in
this
particular
instance,
whether
in
fact
there's
been
any
violation
as
to
a...
a
res
judicata,
collateral
estoppel--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
i
think
for
one
point,
it
would
be
that,
in
fact,
if
the
state
had
chosen
or
selected
a
method
or
a
change
in
the
modification
of
the
method
that
was
not
acceptable
to
him,
then
we'd
be
still
back
at
square
zero--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--the
principle
i'm--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i'm
sorry
that
i
was
in
any
way
disingenuous.
but
the
bottom
line
is
i
think
that
nelson
is
the
bottom
line
source
of...
of
concern
that
we
would
bring
forth
to
this
court
that
if,
in
fact--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
think
the
legal
principle
being
that
the
individual
who
is
coming
forth
and
seeking
to
have
the
execution
or
requesting
some
relief...
he
has
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence,
some...
some
body
of
law--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--and
that...
that
has
been
an
allegation
and
that
has
been
raised
before
the
courts
over
the
years
with
regard
to
that.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that,
in
fact,
recent...
recent
development...
and
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
an
area
that
has
not...
we
have
not
gotten
that
far.
we
don't
have
a
record.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
but
the...
that
procedure...
there
is...
there
is
legal
information
or...
or
scientific
information
out
there
that...
or...
refutes
that,
and
that,
in
fact,
there's
a
different
mechanism
and
that's--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--that's...
that's
correct,
with
regard
to
that
particular
aspect
because
it
was
one
needle
being
used
and
all
the
drugs
were
being
used
in
that
needle.
but
that
is,
again--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--and...
and
that
is
the
core
position
the
state
has
taken,
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
did
not
articulate
that
in
a
fashion
that--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--but--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
and
the
other
reason
we're
arguing
for
something
else,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
basis
upon
which
we
are
here
today
is
to
determine
whether
1983
or
habeas
will
lie.
and
apart
from
that,
i'm
trying
to
make
an
argument,
to
the
extent
i
have
or
not,
that...
that
this
is
more
in
keeping
with
habeas
as
opposed
to
1983
litigation.
thank
you.
