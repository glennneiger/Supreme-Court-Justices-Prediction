justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
rule
11
is
about
frivolous
arguments
and
motions,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
christiansburg
garment
is
about
unreasonable
arguments.
i
suppose
that
not
every
unreasonable
argument
could
be
deemed
to
be
a
frivolous
one.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
you
know
it
when
you
see
it?
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
indeed,
wasn't
there
a
change
in
the
law
after
the
case
was
removed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
tenth
circuit,
i
thought,
held
that
the
district
court
was
within
its
discretion
to
deny
the
award,
because,
at
the
time
of
the
removal,
the
defendants
had
objectively
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
removal
was
proper.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i'm...
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
you
that
rule
11
applies.
it
really
deals
with
frivolous
actions.
and
here,
we're
talking
about
the
imposition
of
reasonable
costs,
are
we
not?
just
costs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
the
standard
is
different
than
that,
under
rule
11.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
why--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
it
in
your
interest
to
ask
us
to
apply
rule
11?
you're
hoping
that,
in
future
cases,
it
will
be
less
likely
that
these
are
awarded?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
solicitor
general,
i
guess,
suggests
that
the
christiansburg
garment
standard
is
the
appropriate
one.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
there
had
been
case
law
changes,
hadn't
there?
