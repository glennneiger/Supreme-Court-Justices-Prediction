justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
it
allows
rule
11
fees
to
be
imposed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
otherwise
wouldn't
be
imposable.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
cuts
against
that
interpretation
is
the
fact
that
it
does
try
to
set
some
standard.
it
says,
"an
order
remanding
the
case
may
require
payment
of
just
cause...
just
costs
and
any
actual
expenses,
including
attorneys
fees.
"
especially
the
"just
costs",
that's
a
standard.
it's
not
saying,
"you
can
use
rule
11
and
apply
whatever
standard
rule
11
contains.
"
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
it
would
really
improve
the
dignity
of
this
court
if
we
referred
to
"piggie
park"
as
"newman".
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
one
could
assume
that
to
be
the
congressional
intent,
if
congress
often
has
such
an
intent
for
such
substantial
imposition
of
financial
liability.
do
you
have
any
other
examples
of
where
congress
has
essentially
left
it
up
to
the
district
judge,
with
a
broad,
virtually
nonreviewable...
i
guess
it's
reviewable,
but...
to
some
extent...
but
multifactor
test,
whatever
the
district
judge
considers
important?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
are
some
other
examples
where
congress
has
allowed
this
degree
of
financial
liability
to
be
subjected
to
the
discretion
of
a
district
judge?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
is
liability
for
what?
in...
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the...
the
broader
discretion
we
give
to
the
district
court,
the
less
litigation
there
is
likely
to
be
on
this
subject.
