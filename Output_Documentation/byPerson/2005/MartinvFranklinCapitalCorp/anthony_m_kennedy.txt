justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
stated,
at
the
outset...
and,
i
think,
properly
so...
that
we're
interested
in
what
incentives--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
put
in
place
by
whatever
rule
we
adopt.
i'm
not
sure
about
the
incentives
in...
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
or
in
other
cases,
based
on
your
rule.
the
defendant
has
only
30
days
to
decide
whether
to
remove.
that's
a
federal
right
that
should
be
given
some
due
consideration.
you,
in
effect,
want
to
make
the
removing
defendant
an
insurer
against
improper
removal.
and
i
just
don't
know
why
that
should
be
the
policy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--shouldn't
we
know
what
the
rule
is
with
reference
to
the
extensive
fees
justice
stevens
requires?
shouldn't
we
know
that,
as
part
of
the
background
for
what
we're
going
to
do
in
this
case?
and
if
you
say...
and
you
seem
to
indicate,
"well,
it's
going
to
be
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
"
well,
if
we
know
what
the
rule
is,
then
it's
not
part
of
the
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
the
lower
courts
addressed
that
issue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there...
are
there
instances,
under
your
view
of
the
statute,
in...
under
the
standard
you
propose,
where
costs
would
be
awarded,
but
not
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and,
once--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--again,
can
you
advise
us
of
their
practice
or
lower
court
opinions
addressing
that
issue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
we
think
of
costs
as
really
a
matter
of
course.
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
it
says
"just
costs",
which...
i
take
it
"just"
modifies
just
the
cost
and
not
the
actual--
