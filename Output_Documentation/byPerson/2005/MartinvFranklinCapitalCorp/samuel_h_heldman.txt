mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
section
1447(c)
provides
for
fee...
for
a
fee
award...
allows
a
fee
award
when
a
case
is
remanded
to
state
court.
there
is,
by
contrast,
no
statute
providing
for
a
fee
award
to
a
defendant
who
removes,
and
successfully
defends
against,
a
motion
to
remand.
there
is
no
statute
providing
for
a
fee
award
against
a
plaintiff
who
wrongly
invokes
the
original
jurisdiction
in
federal
district
courts.
this
indication
that
there
is
something
peculiarly
troublesome
and
problematic
about
an
incorrect
removal
is
borne
out
in
the
case
law
of
this
court
and
other
courts
and
in
the
experience,
i
submit,
of
every
practicing
lawyer,
that
incorrect
removals
have
detrimental
effects,
both
private
and
systemic,
yet
respondents
would
read
section
1447(c)
in
a
way
that
would
leave
it
essentially
without
practical
effect
in
the
world
of
litigation.
it
would
give
no...
it
would
not
effect
litigation
behavior
to
any
perceptible
degree.
but
both
the
text
of
the
statute,
when
read
in
context,
and
in
light
of
the
legal
landscape,
and
the
large
objectives
and
equitable
considerations
at
stake
here,
weigh
in
favor
of
a
standard
that
would,
as
the
seventh
circuit
put
it,
make
fee
awards
the
norm
in
cases
of
improper
removal.
turning,
first,
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
statute
is
notable,
in
that,
unlike
many
fee
shifting
statutes,
it
runs
only
in
one
direction.
that
is
to
say,
it
allows
for
fees
only
when
the
case
is
remanded.
this
is
a
good
textual
indicium
of
remanding,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
shows
that
the
concern
was
with
the
incorrect
removals,
and
the
problems
they
cause
in
deterring
them,
rather
than
a
more
general
concern
about
mitigation
about
questions
of
jurisdiction.
that
is,
a
defendant
cannot
get
a
fee
award
even
if
the
plaintiff's
motion
to
remand
was
not
very
strong.
the
second
thing
that
the
one
way
nature
tells
us
is
that
this,
the
statute,
would
be
practically
meaningless
if
read
as
the
solicitor
general
suggests,
and
as
respondents
suggest,
in
all
but
a
little
sliver,
to
allow
fees
only
when
the
removal
is
unreasonable.
if
that
would
not
be
a
precise
duplicate
of
rule
11,
it
would
at
least
be
close
enough
to
a
precise
duplicate
of
rule
11.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
it
is...
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
shorthand
of
rule
11.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
i
would...
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
there
is
that...
there
is
a
possible
sliver
of
a
distinction,
but
i...
and,
i
submit,
any
lawyer
advising
a
client
and
any
lawyer
advising
himself
or
herself...
would
have
a
hard
time
differentiating
between
the
two
standards,
in
practice,
so
as
actually--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--i
try
to
avoid
all
of
them,
your
honor,
the
frivolous
and
the
unreasonable,
both.
and
i
think
we
all
do.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
the
overlap
may
not
have
been
perfect,
at
least,
among
other
things,
in
the
sense
that
some
courts
were
still
under
the
misimpression
that
there
was
a
subjective
element
to
rule
11,
as
well.
so,
the
solicitor
general
is
correct
in
saying
that
there
is
that
logically
possible
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
in
that
there
is
not
a
perfect
overlay.
we
submit
that,
in
light
of
the
other
available
textual
indicia
and
the
policy
reasons,
that
logically
possible
hypothesis
is
not
the
most
reasonable
hypothesis.
we
have--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--i
think
the
reason
why
i
would
disagree
with
that,
respectfully,
your
honor,
is,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
it
means
"shall"
in
all
instances
in
which
a
case
is
remanded.
the
rule
we
are...
or
standard
we
are
advocating
for
deals
with
that
set
of
cases
in
which
a
plaintiff
has
successfully
sought
remand.
now,
that
may
constitute
most
of
the
cases
that
are
remanded,
but
there
is
still
the...
a
separate
category
of
cases,
at
least
one...
the
case
is
remanded
sua
sponte.
i
could
well
envision
that
those
would
not
be
governed
by
a
"shall"
rule
for
an
award
of
expenses
and
fees.
the--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
classic
example
would
be
if
a
plaintiff's
complaint,
for
whatever
reasons
of
negligence
or
error,
misalleges
the
plaintiff's
state
of
residence;
thus,
making
the
defendant
reasonably
believe
that
there
is
complete
diversity,
defendant
removes,
plaintiff
then
submits
affidavits
and
property
records
and
everything
showing
it
really
was
a
mistake.
and--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--i
think,
even
in
that
hypothetical
case,
which
i
will
say,
next,
is
not
this
case...
even
in
that
hypothetical
case,
it
is
still
the
plaintiff
who
has
the
cleanest
hands
of
all.
the
plaintiff's
hands
are
cleaner
than
those
of
the
defendant--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
if
the
court
would
like,
i
could
explain
a
little
bit
more
about
why
that
occurred.
when
the
case
was
removed...
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
unlike
plaintiffs
in
many
cases,
did
not
have
a
preference
for
state
court.
there
was
no
attempt
to
plead
around
removal.
and
the
case
was
removed,
and
it
was
an
arguably
correct
removal.
and
plaintiffs'
counsel
were
then
in
the
position,
unfortunately,
due
to--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--there
were
relevant
changes
in
law
in
some
circuits,
your
honor.
there
was...
i
don't
believe
any
dispositive
change
in
tenth
circuit
law--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--yes,
your
honor.
and
we
do
not
dispute
that
standard,
because
there
were
out
of
circuit
cases,
though
later
overruled
by
those
own
circuits.
we've
suggested
that
punitive
damages
could
be
aggregated.
and
that
was
the...
that
was
one
of
the
bases
for
removal,
but
not
the
only
one.
so,
when
plaintiffs
removed
the
case,
plaintiffs
had
no
incentive,
by
virtue
of
1447(c),
in
the
way
it
had
been
interpreted
in
the
tenth
circuit,
to
make
remand
their
first
order
of
business,
given
plaintiffs'
experience
that
these
battles
can
be
long
and
hard
and
unrewarding.
and
the
removal
was
arguably
correct.
now,
by
a
year
later,
that
had
changed.
that
calculus
of
the
plaintiffs'
counsel
had
changed
when
defendant...
one
of
the
defendants...
put
in
an
affidavit
suggesting
that
the
named
plaintiffs
had
no
damages.
at
this
point,
the
plaintiffs'
calculus
changed,
because
there
was,
at
this
point,
a
very
real
risk
that
if
plaintiffs
ignored
the
problem
now
and
proceeded
to
a
victory
in
the
district
court,
then
that
victory
could
be
vacated
at
the
defendant's
interest...
instance,
by
claiming
a
lack
of
jurisdiction.
and
this,
then,
was
a
risk
that
the
plaintiffs
could
not
take
at
that
point.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
i...
my
basic
answer
as
to
why
that
would
be
the
policy,
your
honor,
are,
again,
the
textual
reasons
and
the
large
objective
reasons.
let
me
go
back
to
the...
finishing
up
the
textual
reasons,
if
that
is
satisfactory.
the
statute
previously
had
said...
had
included
the
word
"improvident".
back
when
only
costs
could
be
awarded,
and
not
fees,
the
statute
had
used
the
word
"improvident".
now,
many
courts...
and
i
don't
vouch
for
this
interpretation,
but
i
note
that
it
was
prevalent...
many
courts
then
said
costs
may
be
awarded,
or
should
be
awarded,
only
when
the
removal
was
improvident,
in
the
sense
of
being
worse
than
merely
incorrect.
and
the
congress
deleted
that
word,
"improvident"...
"improvidently".
now,
this,
i
submit,
is
a
good
indication
that
the
congress
did
not
mean
for
there
to
be
a
standard
of
"worse
than
incorrectness".
had
congress
meant
for
that
to
be
the
standard,
then
congress
would
not
have
deleted
the
word
that
had
gotten
many
courts
there,
or
congress
would
have
put
in
some
other
textual
reason.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
i'm
sorry--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--your
honor,
i
didn't--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
it
was
a
big
enough
issue
to
be
the
subject
of
comment
among
many
courts
over
the
decades.
it
was
a
big
enough
issue
to
be
covered
in
the
treatises...
the
expense
was
not
great,
but
it
was
a
recurring
mitigated
issue.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that...
to
me,
the
most
natural
reading
of
that
language
is
that
the
district
court,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
will
have
factfinding
authority
as
to
what
fees
and
other
expenses
were--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--incurred
as--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--a
result
of
the
removal.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
my
anticipation
would
be
that
most
courts
would
use
their
factfinding
authority
to
try
to
figure
out
what
work
would
have
to
be
reduplicated
in
the
state
court,
to
compensate
that
work,
or
the
work
that
only
arose
by
virtue
of
it
being
in
federal
court.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
whether
you
call
it
"discretion"
or
"factfinding
authority",
i
think
that's
right.
that
is
a
separate
question
from
what
we
have
here.
but
i
think
the
district
court
would
have
the
first
line
authority
and
the
main--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--authority.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
yes,
your
honor.
i
proposed
what
i
suggest
would
be
the
standard,
which
is,
going
back
to
the
text,
"what
expenses
were
incurred
as
a
result
of.
"
and
i
think
that
naturally
means
"what
were
in...
what
costs
and
fees
were
incurred
that
would
not
have
been
recur...
incurred,
or
would
not
have
been
incurred
again,
had
the
case
been
left
in
state
court.
"
now
i--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is...
that
is
what
i'm
suggesting,
that
the
same
rule
would
apply.
now,
i
would
add--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--yes.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
i--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--i
think
that
is
a
good
characterization,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
of
those
three--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--your
honor,
we
would
prefer
the
"almost
always".
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
not
we
who
would
close
the
doors
of
federal
court.
it
is,
by
definition
in
these
cases,
the
congress
that
has
closed
the
doors
of--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--federal
court.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
no,
your
honor--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--yes,
your
honor.
i'm--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
apologize
for
not
being
clear
enough.
when
i
say
it
is
not
we,
but
the
congress,
that
has
closed
the
doors
of
the
federal
court,
i
mean
on
the
substantive
question
of
whether
the
case
was
removable.
we
are
dealing
here,
only
by
definition,
with
the
cases
that
were
incorrectly
removed.
so,
the
real
question,
i
think,
when
we
get
down
to
the
policies,
is,
there
is
some
concern
that
defendants,
under
the
rule
i
propose,
would
have
an
incentive
to
remove
somewhat
fewer
cases.
they
would
reserve
the
questionable
removals
only
for
the
cases
in
which
they
could
convince
themselves
and
their
clients
that
the
argument
was
good
enough,
and
the
stakes
high
enough,
to
justify
the
cost.
now,
i
submit
to
you,
that's
exactly
the
same
sort
of
situation
we
have
now.
it
is
merely
that,
now,
when
making
that
cost
benefit
analysis,
the
defendant
is
thinking
only
of
its
own
fees
that
it
will
incur.
but,
still,
that
is
a
cost.
and
the
congress,
notably,
has
not
seen
fit
to
alleviate
that
cost
at
all.
so,
some
questionable
removals
are
already
deterred
by
expense
under
the
rule
i
propose;
some,
more
would
be.
on
the
same...
by
the
same
token,
the
rule
i
propose
would
give
good
incentives
to
the
plaintiffs'
lawyers
to
be
aware
of
the
jurisdictional
issues,
to
mitigate
them,
and
mitigate
them
well.
now,
why
do
i
suggest
to
you
that--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--i
don't
know,
your
honor,
whether
the
seventh
circuit
would
follow
up
its
presumption
language
by
saying
the
presumption
can
only
be
overcome
in
extraordinary
circumstances.
that
is,
i
don't
know
whether
the
seventh
circuit
sees
its
standard
as
the
piggie
park
standard
or
as
something
slightly
towards
the
middle
from
the
piggie
park
standard.
i
think,
in
this
case,
we
would
win
either
way,
but
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
a
systemic
benefit
from
not
having
a
multiplicity
of
standards,
from
having
at
least
most
attorneys
fee
shifting
disputes
be
resolvable
by,
is
it
"almost
always",
is
it
"who
knows",
or
is
it
"never,
unless
unreasonable"?
i
think
there's
a
benefit
to
having
nessatavite
litigation
over--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
rather
than
characterizing
those
as
"removal
friendly",
i
would
characterize
them
as
"resource
friendly".
i
think
all
of
this
can
be...
can
be
understood
as
a
congressional
effort,
overall,
to
reduce
the
amount
of
resources
that
are
put
into
jurisdictional
issues.
and
the
rule
we're
proposing
would
further
that
goal;
that
is,
by
somewhat
deterring
the,
by
definition,
incorrect
removal.
now,
on...
every
incorrect
removal
not
only
harms
the
plaintiff...
harms
the
plaintiff
a
good
bit...
the
delay,
the
expense...
and
there's
been
some
concern
i've
heard
voiced
about
the
great
expense
that
this
might
impose
on
defendants...
it
imposes
a
great
expense
on
defendants
only
precisely
in
as
much
as
the
defendant
has
imposed
a
great
expense
on
the
plaintiff
by
its
incorrect
action.
now,
it
is
true
that
fees--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--in
that
aspect
of
fogerty,
your
honor,
the
court
had
already
gotten
to
the
point
of
saying,
"the
standard
is
the
same
for
prevailing
plaintiff
and
prevailing
defendant.
"
and
then,
in
the...
in
the
passage
we're
talking
about,
the
court
was
looking
at
the
"one
size"
argument.
okay.
and
that
same
standard
for
both
should
be
"usually"
or
"nearly
always".
and
it
was
in
that
context,
in
which
there
would
be
a
"shall"
or
"nearly
always",
running
both
ways,
that
the
court
said,
"that
would
be
a
rare
bird
in
american
law.
"
the
"both
ways"
british
rule
that...
which
is
my
understanding
of
the
british
rule...
"that's
such
a
rare
bird,
we
would
want
to
see
some
clearer
indication
of
that.
"
in
this
case,
i
submit,
we
don't
have
a
rare
bird
at
all.
it
is
not
unusual
to
have
a...
to
have
"may"
interpreted
in
a
statute
as
meaning
"usually
should",
in
some
class
of
cases.
piggie
park
did
it.
many
cases
in
other
contexts,
following
piggie
park.
so,
it's
not
such
a
rare
bird.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because,
first
of
all,
it
is
true
that
usually
you're
awarding
fees
against
a
violator
of
federal
law.
but
that
is
because
most
fee
statutes
involve
federal
causes
of
action.
this
is
unusual
and
notable,
in
that
it
is
a
fee
shifting
statute
for
a
procedural
violation.
therefore,
to
say,
"yes,
but
they
didn't
violate
federal
law.
"
proves
too
much,
i
think.
and
so,
we
shouldn't
make
such
a
distinction
between
the
private
attorney
general
cases
and
this
case,
because
the
plaintiff...
every
plaintiff
who
successfully
seeks
remand
is
furthering
systemic
values,
as
well
as
the
plaintiff's
own
values,
is
furthering
the
value
of
comity,
federalism,
state
sovereignty,
the
federal
docket
load,
and
helping
to
avoid
the--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--that
is
largely
because,
your
honor,
the
congress
does
not
pass
statutes
allowing
for
fee
shifting.
and,
second,
removal
is
different.
removal
has
federalism
concerns,
as
this
court
has
noted,
going
back
into
the
'40s.
removal...
jurisdiction
being
an
unwaivable
thing,
these
cases...
wrong
removal
possibly
leading
to
the
disaster
in
which
the
case
goes
to
trial
in
federal
court,
judgment
is
entered,
and
it
has
to
be
vacated
on
appeal
and
done
all
over
again,
because
nobody
recognized
the
jurisdictional
issue.
by
encouraging
plaintiffs
to
challenge
these
more
effectively,
and
by
encouraging
defendants
to
reserve
their
questionable
efforts
only
for
the
cases
that
really
deserve
it,
i
think
we
would
be...
we
would
be
serving
public
ends,
as
well
as
private
ones.
now,
i
would
love
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
unless
there
are
further
questions.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
first,
regarding
the
continued
insinuation
of
some
manipulative
intent
by
the
timing
of
the...
of
the
removal,
there
was,
in
this
case,
no
finding
by
the
district
court,
no
suggestion
by
the
district
court,
that
there
was
any
such
intent,
or
that
that
was
a
reason
to
deny
fees,
no
suggestion
by
either
of
the
lower
courts
to
that
effect.
absent
that,
i
think
it
might
be
that
a
delay
in
removal
could,
in
an
appropriate
case,
be
something
that
went
into
the
calculus
of
what
expenses
and
fees
were
incurred
as
a
result
of
the
removal.
that
may
well
go
into
the
"amount"
question.
but,
absent
a
manipulative
intent,
it
is
still
the
case
that
it
is
the
plaintiff
who
successfully
sought
remand,
whenever
it
happened,
that
has
the
cleanest
hands
in
the
courtroom.
second,
respondents
describe
their
proposal
as
a
middle
ground.
there
is
no
middle
ground
in
this
case,
unless
it
is,
"eh,
who
knows"?
their
proposal
is
not
middle
ground,
because
their
proposal
says,
"there
shall
be
no
award
of
fees,
in
general.
"
as
the
most
important
factor,
where
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
removal.
that
cannot
be
described
as
a
middle
ground.
that
tilts
it
in
one
way.
we
tilt
it
in
the
other
way.
and,
as
i
say,
a
middle
ground
only
gets
you
perhaps
to
fogerty.
and
it...
and,
as
we
show
on
page
30
of
our
blue
brief,
in
the
footnote,
the
district...
there
has
been
a
lot
of
litigation,
after
fogerty,
still
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
standard
is...
not
only
district
court
litigation,
but
appellate
litigation,
and
the
circuits
are
all
over
the
map
as
to
even
what
the
copyrights
standard
is.
i
urge
the
court,
for
the
benefit
of
the
practicing
bar,
as
well
as
the
bench,
not
to
go
down
that
road.
now,
the
road
made
some
sense
in
fogerty,
and
multifactor
tests
makes
some
sense
in
the...
foia
and
erisa,
because,
in
those
instances,
there
are
very
weighty
public
interests
on
both
sides
of
the
litigation.
when
an
erisa
claimant
sues
the
erisa
fund,
it's
not
a...
it's
not
that
one
is
the
particular
favorite
of
the
law;
they
are
both
favorites--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--of
the
law.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
that
standard
is
appropriate,
as
in
christiansburg,
your
honor,
where
the
party
who
is
potentially
subject
to
the
award
is
the
favorite
of
the
law
in
question.
that
is,
where
there
is
a
special
reason
not
to
seek
to
over
deter
that
person,
to
encourage
that
person
to
litigate
creatively
and
aggressively
the
reasonable,
though
ultimately
wrong,
propositions.
and
so,
i
think
the
case
reduces,
in
a
large
sense,
to,
does
federal
law
encourage
the
creative
aggressive
litigation
of
questionable
removals?
and
among
the
ways
we
know
that
it
does
not
is
that
this
court
has
said,
for
60-something
years,
that
removal
is
strictly
construed,
as
every
circuit
has
understood
that
to
mean.
that
means
doubts
are
resolved
in
favor
of
remand.
if
congress
wanted
to
encourage
the
removal
of
questionable
cases
and
get
it
all
hashed
out
and
make
the
defendants...
they
would,
first
of
all,
abrogate
that
rule,
and,
second,
they
would
remove
the
rule
in
section
1447(d)
precluding
reviews
of
remand
orders.
because
as
we
have
it
now,
except
for
special
cases
where
the
congress
decides
otherwise,
like
the
recent
class
action
act,
where
we
have,
otherwise,
the
substantive
law
is
bent
towards
remand,
bent
against
the
creative
and
aggressive
advocacy
of
perfectly
reasonable,
but
wrong,
propositions.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
my
experience--
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
my
experience
in
the
district
courts
is
that
they
do
do
an
initial
screening,
as
they
should,
in
order
to
limit
themselves
on
their
own
motion
to
their
own
proper
jurisdiction.
this
court,
unfortunately...
the
district
court...
did
not.
but
my
experience
in
the
district
courts
is
that
some
of
them
do,
but
a
lot
of...
at
least
a
substantial
number
of
cases
slip
through
the
cracks.
mr.
samuel
h.
heldman
thank
you,
your
honor.
