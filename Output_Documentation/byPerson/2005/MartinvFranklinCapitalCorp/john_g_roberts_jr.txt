we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
martin
versus
franklin
capital
corporation.
mr.
heldman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but,
when
congress
passed
this
language,
the
scope
of
rule
11
was
not
as
well
defined
and
understood
as
it
is
now.
so,
the
overlap
argument
you're
making
may
not
really
go
to
what
congress
had
in
mind.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
talk
about
the
text,
though...
and
i
understand
that
the
"may"
language
here
has
been
read
by
the
court
in
very
different
ways,
depending
upon
the
statute...
but
you
have
a
statute
that
literally
alternates
sentences
between
"shall/may",
"shall/may",
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
your
rule
is
closer
to
"shall"
than
"may",
it
seems
that
it
was
an
odd
choice
of
words
for
congress
to
employ.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
a
general...
you're...
you
seem
to
be
arguing
more
generally
for
the
british
rule,
rather
than
the
american
rule.
and
i
read
our
decision
in
fogerty
to
say
that
when
we're
confronted
with
language
like
this,
"may",
you
don't
assume
that
congress
intended
to
overrule
the
basic
american
rule
and
apply
the
british
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
those
were
all
the,
you
know,
private
attorneys
general
type
cases,
where
you're...
where
the
view
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
carrying
out
a
mission
of
ferreting
out
and
enforcing
the
law.
but
that's...
this
is
a
quite
different
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
every
party
who
prevails
on
a
motion
to
admit
evidence
or
to
exclude
evidence
is
promoting
the
policies
and
the
rules
of
evidence,
but
we
don't
think
that
those
motions
should
result
in
a...
in
fee
shifting.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
heldman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
chilton,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
a
comparative
advantage
of
the
solicitor
general's
approach,
and,
by
the
same
token,
of
the
petitioner's
contrary
approach,
is
that
it
avoids
a
lot
of
litigation
over
a
collateral
issue,
like
which
court
you
ought
to
be
in.
as
soon
as
you
get
into
a
multifactor
analysis,
then
you
get
briefs
on
both
sides
arguing
their
factors
and
the
other
side's
factors,
and
the
judge
has
to
decide.
if
there's
a
presumption
that
applies
in
most
cases,
you
don't
waste
time
over
jurisdictional
squabbles
like
this.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
your
position
on
what
fees
we're
talking
about.
do
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
money
that's
spent,
that's
going
to
have
to
be
spent
anyway
in
the
state
court
proceeding,
though,
is
not
wasted,
that
that's
not
recoverable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
not
those
very
cases.
by
definition,
this
issue
only
comes
up
when
the
case
should
not
have
been
removed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
it's
not
the
cases
that
congress
wanted
to
be
removed
that
we're
talking
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
heldman,
you
have
four
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
in
04-1140,
martin
versus
franklin
capital
corporation.
this
case
began
when
the
martins
brought
a
class-action
suit
in
new
mexico
state
court
against
franklin
capital.
franklin
removed
the
case
to
federal
court,
arguing
that
there
was
jurisdiction
based
on
diversity
of
citizenship.
the
case
eventually
made
its
way
to
the
10th
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
held
that
removal
was
improper.
it
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
remand
it
to
state
court.
when
it
got
back
to
the
district
court,
the
martins
pointed
out
section
1447(c)
of
the
judicial
code.
that
provides
that
when
a
removed
case
is
remanded
to
state
court,
what
the
court
of
appeals
told
the
district
court
to
do,
ordering
the
remand,
“may
require
payment
of
just
costs
and
any
actual
expanses,
including
attorney
fees,
incurred
as
a
result
of
the
removal”.
the
district
court,
however,
denied
the
martins’
request
for
attorneys’
fees,
saying
that
franklin’s
basis
for
removal
was
reasonable,
even
if
wrong.
the
martins
appealed,
and
the
10th
circuit
affirmed.
it
turns
out
that
courts
of
appeals
around
the
country
have
adopted
different
standards
for
when
district
courts
should
award
attorneys’
fees
under
section
1447(c),
so
we
granted
review
to
resolve
the
conflict.
now,
when
a
statute
says
that
a
district
court
may
award
attorneys’
fees,
but
doesn’t
provide
any
guidance
as
to
when
it
should
award
such
fees,
we
don’t
just
throw
up
our
hands
and
leave
it
to
the
hundreds
of
district
courts
around
the
country.
instead,
what
we
have
done
in
other
cases
is
look
to
the
underlying
objectives
of
the
law
and
sought
to
find
in
those
objective
standards
to
guide
the
discretion
of
the
district
courts.
sometimes
we’ve
said
that
fees
should
usually
be
awarded,
as
in
the
case
of
prevailing
plaintiffs
in
civil-rights
cases.
we
don’t
think
that
we
should
adopt
such
a
standard
here,
because
congress
gave
defendants
a
right
to
remove,
and
awarding
fees
in
the
usual
case
might
discourage
all
but
the
most
obvious
cases
of
removal.
sometimes
we’ve
said
that
fees
should
usually
not
be
awarded
unless
the
defendant’s
position,
the
losing
party’s
position,
was
frivolous;
and
we
don’t
think
that
standard
is
appropriate
here,
either,
since
it
seems
that
congress
wanted
the
prospect
of
awarding
fees
to
serve
a
more
significant
role
in
discouraging
removals
that
might
be
intended
to
prolong
the
litigation
or
impose
costs
on
plaintiffs.
we
think
that
the
correct
standard
looks
to
the
objective
reasonableness
of
the
defendant’s
basis
for
removal.
if
the
defendant’s
position
was
reasonable,
even
though
ultimately
unsuccessful,
he
should
not
have
to
pay
the
other
side’s
fees;
but
if
his
position
was
unreasonable,
as
well
as
wrong,
he
should.
because
franklin’s
grounds
for
removal
were
reasonable,
the
lower
courts
correctly
denied
the
martins’
request
for
fees.
for
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk,
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
