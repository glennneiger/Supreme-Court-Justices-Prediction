what
about
the
plaintiff
who
waits
over
a
year
to
move
for
remand
when
it
appears
as
though
the
case
is
going
in
the
defendant's
favor?
doesn't
"may"
give
a
district
court
discretion
to
say,
"i'm
not
going
to
reward
a
plaintiff,
who
wants
to
go
back
to
state
court
only
when
he
was
on
the
brink
of
losing
in
federal
court,
with
fees.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just...
you
say
that
your
presumptive
fees
are
included
would
cover
that
case.
it,
in
part,
is...
resembles
your
case,
because
you
didn't
move
to
remand
until
the
case
was
pending
in
the
federal
district
court
for
over
a
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
a
big
issue
when
the
provision
did
not
provide
for
counsel
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
the
statute
provided
for
costs--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--which,
in
our
system,
do
not
include
counsel
fees,
was
it
a
big
issue
when
all
that
was
included
was
costs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
under
your
rule,
there's
a
presumption.
i
thought
that
the
rule
you're
asking
us
to
approve
is
the
one
that's
applicable
in
the
seventh
circuit,
which
is
that
you
presume
there
will
be
counsel
fees
when
a
case
is
remanded
to
the
state
court,
unless
there
are
extraordinary
circumstances
that
would
overcome
the
presumption.
now,
that's
what
you're...
that's
the
rule
you're
asking
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
such
a
different
in
the
context.
the
title
vii
plaintiff
gets
fees
after
a
defendant
has
been
found
a
law
violator.
and,
here,
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
access
to
a
federal
court.
and
the
statute...
you
are
emphasizing
text.
if
one
looks
at
the
omnibus
act
out
of
which
this
provision
came,
we
see
two
removal
friendly
pieces
in
it,
right?
because,
no
longer
do
you
have
to
verify
a
removal
petition;
you
just
do
a
simple
notice.
that's
one.
and
there
was
another.
oh,
yes.
yes,
you
don't
have
to
put
up
a
bond
anymore
if
you
want
to
remove.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--think
we
do
have
three,
if
you
count
fogerty,
because
you
have
the
christianson,
which
is
the
most
defendant
friendly.
and
then
you
have
piggie
park,
which
is
the
most
plaintiff
friendly.
and
then
you
have
fogerty,
which
is
been...
has
been
called
the
multifactor--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
as
it
was
just
mentioned,
"multifactor",
in
a
footnote,
it
said
it
would
be
neutral.
i
think
the
big
point
in
fogerty
was
that
it
was
going
to
apply
in
both
directions,
be
neutral
as
between
plaintiff
and
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
given
us,
in
your
multifactor
test,
you
said,
"objectively
reasonable
basis
to
remove".
and
another
factor
might
be
that
the
plaintiff
delayed
in
moving
to
remand.
what
other
factors,
besides
the
"objectively
reasonable
basis
to
remove"
and
the
plaintiff's
delay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not,
then,
just
say
"objectively
reasonable
basis
to
remove"?
that's
a
one...
one
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
law
was
so
anti
removal,
then
one
would
expect
there
would
be
some
kind
of
threshold
check
once
you
get
to
district
court.
but
the
removal
process
is,
you
file
your
notice
that
you're
removing.
that's
it.
there
it
goes.
and
the
district
court
doesn't
do
any
kind
of
initial
screening
to
let
it
in.
it
just
gets
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--by
rapid
transit.
