mr.
jan
t.
chilton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
since
the
first
judiciary
act
of
1789,
congress
has
given
defendants
the
right
to
remove
cases
to
federal
court.
respondents
did
so
properly
in
this
case,
and
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
the...
both
lower
courts
found
that
we
had
reasonable
grounds
for
removal,
on
two
bases...
based
on
the
only
circuit
court
decisions
then
extant
on
aggregating
punitive
damages
and
attorneys
fees.
petitioners
conceded
that
fact
here
this
morning
and
also
in
the
trial
court,
district
court,
before
they
moved
to
remand,
a
year
after
removal
and
after
the
district
court
in
the
same
hearing
had
indicated
its
tentative
decision
to
rule
against
them
on
the
merits
of
a
dismissal
motion.
so,
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
1447(c)
requires
a
district
court
to
impose
a
substantial
penalty
in
the
form
of
attorneys
fees
on
respondents
for
what
is
concededly
in
this
case
a
reasonable,
but
ultimately
unsuccessful,
exercise
of
their
statutory
right
to
remove.
and
we
think
the
answer
to
that
answer
to
that
question
is
clearly
no,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
section
1447(c)
is
not
a
fee
shifting
statute
at
all.
like
its
predecessor,
section
5
of
the
act
of
march
3,
1875,
section
1447(c)
just
confirms
the
district
court's
power
to
award
fees,
as
well
as
costs,
when
it
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and,
therefore,
must
remand
the
case.
there
was
a
prior
contrary
common
law
rule,
and
the
act
of
march
3,
1875
abrogated
it.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
my
response
would
be
that,
as
the
questioning
already
today
in
the
court
has
revealed,
there
are
two
questions
on
a
fee
motion.
one
is
entitlement,
the
other
is
amount.
"just
costs"
refers
to
amount,
not
entitlement.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
just
costs
and
expenses,
including
attorneys
fees,
yes.
it
is--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--well,
if
the
court
interprets--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--you--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--well,
we're
proposing
our
first
argument,
because
we
think
it's
textually
correct
and
historically
correct.
it
leads
to
the
same
result,
in
our
case,
a
point
i
was
about
to
make.
our
second
argument
is
that,
even
if
you
construe
this
statute
as
a
fee
shifting
statute,
the
standard
under
the
fee
shifting
statute
should
be
the
one
that
your
honor
just
mentioned,
which
is,
it's
a
multifactor
test,
but
the
primary
factor
is
whether
the
ground
for
removal
is
objectively
reasonable.
and
under
that
standard,
we
win.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
that
is
true,
he
does.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
well,
our
two
standards,
i
believe,
are
relatively
close.
we
both
focus
on
the
objective
reasonableness
of
the
removal.
now,
the
solicitor
general,
i
believe,
is
a
little
bit
less...
leaves
a
little
bit
less
discretion
to
the
district
court
than
we
would.
we
believe
that
congress,
in
using
the
word
"may",
in
using,
if
you
wanted
to
look
at
this
as
a
fee
shifting
statute,
the
word
"just",
meant
to
leave
district
courts
with
considerable
range
of
discretion
to
deal
with
cases
that
come
up
that
are
unusual
in
the
way
a
party
can
"game
the
system",
if
you
will,
in
respect
to
removal.
for
example,
in
this
case,
waiting
as
long
as
the
plaintiff
did
before
seeking
a
remand.
obviously
a
plaintiff--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--there
had
been,
but
that
was
not
the
reason
for
their
delayed
motion
for
remand.
as
they
explained
in
the
trial
court,
the
reason
they
suddenly
became
aware,
supposedly,
of
the
right
to
remand
was
this
declaration
saying
that
they,
the
plaintiffs,
hadn't
paid
any
money
for
collateral
protection
insurance,
a
fact
of
which
they
must
have
been
aware
at
the
time
they
filed
their
complaint.
furthermore,
in
the
tenth
circuit,
you
cannot
look
to
any
document,
other
than
the
complaint
or
notice
of
removal,
to
establish
the
facts
for
removal
jurisdiction.
therefore,
the
declaration
could
not
possibly
have
justified
a
motion
to
remand.
but,
in
any
case,
my
more
general
point,
apart
from
the
facts
of
this
case,
is
that
there
are
cases
in
which
one
party
or
the
other
uses
remand
to
basically
avoid
a...
an
adverse
decision
on
the
substance,
and
when
that
party
does,
whether
it's
the
defendant
or
the
plaintiff,
we
feel
that
the
district
court
ought
to
have
discretion
to
award
fees.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
well,
first
you
have
the
jurisdictional
dispute,
of
course,
resolved.
it's
only
when
there's
a
remand
that
you
get
to
the
fee
issue.
but,
your
more
general
point
is,
yes,
obviously
a
categorical
rule
will
have
less
litigation
than
a
multifactor
test.
the
question
is,
what
did
congress
want
+/?
not,
what
will
reduce
litigation
costs?
and
we
believe
congress
would
have
wanted,
in
this
situation,
and
did
want,
to
allow
for
discretion
to
be
exercised.
now,
it's
a
limited
discretion
under
our
test,
because
if...
in
general,
if
the
removal
is
objectively
reasonable,
as
ours
was,
we
believe
congress
would
not
have
allowed
an
award
of
fees,
except
in
those
circumstances,
as
i've
mentioned,
where
the
system
is
being
gamed
by
one
party
or
another.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
well--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--no--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--you're--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--quite
correct,
in
our
view,
justice
ginsburg.
we
believe
petitioners
are
requesting
the
piggie
park
standard.
we
believe
the
solicitor
general
is
proposing
the
christiansburg
garment
standard.
and
we
think
we're
smack
in
the
middle,
with
fogerty.
now--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--i
have
no
response
to
that
remark,
your
honor.
[laughter]
to
pick
up
the
train
of
my
argument--
--we
believe
that
discretion
is
not
only
the
better
part
of
valor,
but
what
congress
enacted
in
this
statute.
and
that's
what
fogerty
said...
"may"
means
"may",
it
doesn't
mean
"must"...
it
connotes
discretion...
and
that
an
automatic
rule
for
the
award
of
fees
on
remand,
or
even
the
contrary
rule,
would
pretermit
that
discretion,
so
that
when,
as
in
this
case,
there
are
not
overriding
public
policy...
public
policies
that
are
enforced
by
one
party...
for
example,
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
where
it
is
the
plaintiff
who
is
the
private
attorney
general
enforcing
what
this
court
has
said,
or
congress's
most
important
policies...
when
that's
not
present,
as
in
this
case,
then
"may"
means
"may".
particularly,
that's
so
when,
as
in
this
case,
the
defendant
is
not
a
violator
of
federal
law,
has
done
nothing
that
impinges
or
removes
rights
from
the
defendant...
or,
excuse
me,
the
plaintiff...
but,
in
fact,
serves
federal
interest
in
seeking
removal.
that--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--yes,
your
honor,
i
do--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
the
freedom
of
information
act,
your
honor,
which
was
passed
in
1974,
which,
interestingly,
i
think,
undermines
the
petitioner's
argument
that,
in
using
the
word
"may",
congress
somehow
incorporated
the
"newman"
standard.
[laughter]
the...
in
1974,
in
adopting
the
freedom
of
information
act,
congress
specifically
considered
adopting...
and
it
was
in
the
senate
bill...
a
four
factor
test.
it
was
removed
from
the
bill,
and
the...
both
conference
reports
on
that
bill
explained
that
it
was
removed
not
to
require
a
district
court
to
award
fees
automatically
in
any
case,
but,
rather,
because
the
existing
law
was
following,
in
fact,
a
multifactor
analysis,
and
congress
wished
to
preserve
it
and
felt
that
the
four
factor
test,
which
had
been
in
the
senate
bill,
was
too
restrictive.
now,
there
is
another
example,
as
well,
in
the...
in
erisa.
the
cases
under
erisa...
other
than
the
special
case
of
trust
funds
seeking
delinquent
contributions
from
employers;
those
are
treated
differently...
but
for
cases
simply
of
suits
by
trustees
against
beneficiaries,
beneficiaries
against
employers,
beneficiaries
against
trustees,
the
courts
have,
in
fact,
employed
a
multifactor
test.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
denying
benefits,
for
example.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
not
pure
discretion.
the
footnote
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
says
that
district
courts
may
follow
the
third
circuit
standard,
looking
first
at
whether
the
argument
of
the
losing
party
was
frivolous,
unreasonable,
et
cetera,
and
then
looking
at
other
factors
that
are
indicated
by
the
particular
concerns
of
the
copyright
act.
and,
yes,
i
quite...
you're,
of
course,
right
that
the...
fogerty
did
adopt
the
multifactor
test
under
the
copyright
act.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
that
much
is
true,
but
the
footnote
does
say
that,
in
applying
the
neutral
standard,
the
district
courts
are
free
to
follow--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--well,
we
outlined
several
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
at
page...
let
me
see...
page
41.
in
addition,
i
think
the
case
of
gardner
versus
allstate
indemnity,
147
f.
2d
1257
indicates
another.
there,
the
defendant
moved
successfully
to
remand
after
receiving
a...
an
adverse
decision
on
the
merits.
it
may
have
had
an
objectively
reasonable
ground
for
removal.
in
that
case,
it
actually
didn't,
but,
i
mean,
you
can
conceive
of
a
situation
in
which
they
would
have
had
one.
and,
obviously,
after
the
merits
decision
went
against
it,
it
wanted
a
second
chance.
now,
in
that
situation,
i
believe
a
district
court
might,
despite
the
objectively
reasonable
basis
for
removal,
decide
that
the
defendant
should
pay
costs
and
fees.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
i
absolutely
do
not
agree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
"incurred
by
reason
of
the
removal.
"
refers
to
fees
and
costs
that
are
specifically
directed
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
and
that
only;
no
other
fees
or
costs
in
the
litigation
at
all.
of
course,
that
question
isn't
presented
here,
because
we
had
no...
or
the
lower
courts
decided
that...
the
petitioner
is--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
well,
if
you
view
1447(c)
as
an...
a
power
enabling
bill,
not
a
fee
shifting
statute,
the
answer
is
yes.
i
believe
if
the...
if
it's
viewed
as
a
fee
shifting
statute,
the
answer
would
be
no,
although,
of
course,
the
court
has
discretion
to
decide
how
much
to
award,
and,
in
that
sense,
could
award
either
no
fees
and
all
costs,
or
some--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--combination.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
i
cannot,
but
there
certainly
are
lower
court
decisions
that
allow
fees
on
remand
in
very
small
amounts
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
sufficient
to
compensate
for
the
work
done.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
well,
as
the
statute
is
written,
that's
true.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
well,
that
may
be,
your
honor.
i
read
the
decision,
and
perhaps--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--incorrectly--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--as
steer--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--yes.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
that
is
certainly
true.
fewer
appeals,
at
any
rate.
and
as
long
as
we're
talking
about
litigation
expense,
i
think,
to
bring
us
back
to
one
of
petitioner's
arguments,
they
contend
that
their
standard
would
reduce
the
amount
of
costs
invested
in
jurisdictional
issues.
but,
in
the
same
breath,
they
also
say
that
the
standard
that
they
propose
would
encourage
plaintiffs
to
move
for
remand.
the
two
cannot
coexist.
if...
not
every
remand
motion
is
meritorious.
so,
by
encouraging
plaintiffs
to
move
for
remands,
you're,
in
fact,
increasing
the
amount
of
jurisdictional
litigation
and
the
amount
of
costs
incurred
at...
over
jurisdictional
issues.
i
wanted,
if
i
could,
to
answer
one
question
that
justice
ginsburg
asked
in
the
beginning
about
the
omnibus
act.
justice
ginsburg
mentioned
that
it
contained
removal
friendly
provisions.
and
it
does.
they're
not
only
the
two
that
were
mentioned...
lack
of...
or
abolition
of
the
verification
doctrine
and
deletion
of
the
removal
bond...
but
much
more
significant
expansions
of
removal
jurisdiction.
the...
for
us
from
california,
in
particular,
the
1988
act
said
that
you
could
disregard
the
citizenship
of
"doe",
or
fictitiously
named,
defendants
in
deciding
whether
there
was
diversity...
complete
diversity
in
a
case.
that
was
huge
for
us
in
california,
because
virtually
every
state
court
complaint
in
california
contains
"doe"
defendants.
and
prior
to
that
amendment,
their
citizen...
you
had
to
guess
at
their
citizenship,
and
it
prevented
removal
of
virtually
all
state
court
complaints,
on
diversity
grounds.
so,
to
say
that
this
1988
act
was
designed
to
discourage
removals
plainly
goes
against
the
text
of
the
act.
furthermore,
removal
furthers
not
only
the
private
interest
of
the
defendant,
but
the
government's
interest,
the
federal
interest,
the
interest
of
the
people
of
the
united
states,
in
many
cases.
and
that's
precisely
why
congress
has
given
us
the
right
to
remove
in
a
whole
series
of
areas,
not
only
in
diversity,
but,
of
course,
in
federal
question.
an
interesting
example,
because
it
arose
for
the
first
time
in
1875,
in
the
same
act
of
march
3,
1875,
from
which
this
cost
provision
comes,
an
act
that
was
passed
by
the
lame
duck
radical
republicans
at
the
same
time
they
passed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1875,
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
federal
courts
to
enforce
the
new
federal
rights
that
congress
felt
were
not
being
adequately
addressed
in
state
courts.
so,
the
state
courts,
particularly
the
south,
were
thought
to
be
hostile
to
the
new
federal
rights.
similarly,
just
this
year,
in
the
class
action
fairness
act,
congress
allowed
defendants
to
remove
multi
state
class
actions,
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendants,
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
entire
nation.
it...
the
senate
report,
at
page
9,
specifically
points
out
that
it
is
those
cases
which
most
affect
the
interstate
commerce
of
this
nation,
and,
for
that
reason,
they
belong
in
federal
court.
now,
why
would
congress
choose
to
discourage
defendants
from
removing
those
very
cases
by
adopting
a
plaintiff
friendly--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--the--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--but,
as
this
court
explained
in
piggie...
no,
excuse
me,
christiansburg
garment,
your
honor...
the
imposition
of
fees
discourages
activity
when
it's
a
federal
right
that's
being
enforced,
saying
that
fees
are
imposed
whenever
there's
a
near
miss,
a
reasonable
case
that's
brought
to
enforce
the
federal
right.
you
discourage
the
very
thing
that
congress
intended
people
to
enforce.
that's
my
point
here.
yes,
it's
true,
fees
would
only
be
awarded
in
those
cases
where
the
defendant
is
unsuccessful
and
the
case
is
remanded.
but,
for
example,
in
the
class
action
fairness
act,
that
can
happen
even
when
there's
a
perfectly,
not
just
reasonable,
but
exactly
proper
ground
of
removal,
because
the
class
action
fairness
act,
among
other
things,
says
that
when
there's
more
than
one
third,
and
less
than
two
thirds,
the
citizens
in
the
state
in
which
the
complaint
was
originally
filed,
they're
in
the
class,
then
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
remand
the
case,
even
if
it's
properly
brought
in
federal
court,
removed
to
federal
court.
so,
my
general
point
is
that
congress
has
enacted
these
removal
statutes
to
promote
federal
policy,
and
that
it
would
be
counter
to
that
policy
to
discourage
defendants
from
removing
cases,
particularly
if
the
amount
of
fees
that
could
be
awarded
would
include
all
the
fees
incurred
in
federal
court.
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
very
substantial
fee
awards,
in
that
event.
and
they
would
be
a
significant
deterrent
from
exercising
the
very
rights
that
congress
has
said
defendants
should
have
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
furthermore,
as
already
pointed
out,
state
court
plaintiffs
never
enforce
congressional
policy;
otherwise,
they'd
be
in
federal
court,
under
federal
question
jurisdiction.
the
defendant
has
not
violated
federal
law,
so
neither
of
the
exceptional
circumstances--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--yes,
but
those
can
be
removed,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
well--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--i--
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
--i,
perhaps,
was
overgeneralizing.
what
i
meant
to
say
was,
in
cases
that
are
remanded
because
of
lack
of
federal
jurisdiction,
it
is
never
the
case
that
the
plaintiff
is
enforcing
a
federal
right,
because,
if
he
were,
there
would
be
federal
question
jurisdiction.
mr.
jan
t.
chilton
that's
right.
in
any
event,
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
am
through.
