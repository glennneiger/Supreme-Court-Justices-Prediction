justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
you're
arguing
for.
that
is,
i...
when
i
get
through
all
these
words
in
the
attorneys
fees
cases,
i've
got
it
in
my
mind
that,
like
the
civil
rights
statute,
they
say,
"you
normally
get
fees,
unless
you
shouldn't.
"
all
right?
that
means
you're
normally
gonna
to
get
'em.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
plaintiff,
anyway.
all
right?
then
we
have
a
case
with
a
copyright.
the
copyright
says
it's
all
the
way
up
to
the
district
court,
really,
which
means
a
grab
bag,
and
what
the
particular
judge
thinks
is
fair
in
the
instance.
and
i
guess
you
could
have
a
rule
saying,
"you
hardly
ever
get
fees".
so,
in
my
mind,
i
got
it,
"well,
who
knows"?
and,
"no,
you
almost
always
do.
"
or,
"no,
you
almost
always
don't.
"
now,
is
that
a
good
characterization?
and
what...
which
one
of
those
three
are
you
arguing
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you're
not
arguing
for
"you
always
don't".
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then,
which
one
do
you
want?
do
you
want
the
thing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
you
want
"you
always
get
them",
in
the
civil
liberties
cases
there
is
a
good
policy
reason,
according
to
the
court,
underlying
that
judgment
of
how
congress
wanted
to
give
this
to
people
to
vindicate
civil
liberties.
i've
never
heard
of
a
policy
of
closing
the
federal
court
door,
because
if,
in
fact,
you
were
to
have
that
rule
in
this
case,
it
would
simply
discourage
people
from
removing
it
in
cases
where
they
think
they
have
a
good
claim
to
remove
it,
because
they'd
have
to
pay
huge
costs
if
they
were
wrong.
so,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
closing
doors
of
federal
court
policy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--unfortunately,
i
guess,
from
your
position,
i
don't
know
what
congress
meant
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
therefore,
i'm
trying
to
figure
it
out
in
terms
of
the
policy--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
well
as
the
language.
okay,
in
terms
of
the
policy,
i'm
simply
saying
that
i
don't
know
why
you
have
a
better
claim
than
a
copyright
plaintiff,
and
i
can
think
of
why
you
don't
have
as
good
a
claim
as
a
civil
rights
plaintiff,
the
reason
i
said.
so,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
hard
to
have
three
different
kinds
of
standards
with
attorneys
fees
statutes.
i
mean,
there
are
quite
a
few
of
them,
and...
i
can
understand
saying
some
of
those
statutes
mean
you
almost
always
should
get
it,
because
of
special
policies
reflected
in
the
history
of
the
statute,
et
cetera.
that's
christianson.
and
i
can
imagine
fogerty,
where
you
say,
"as
to
an
ordinary
one,
it's
ordinary.
"
"ordinary"
means
it's
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge.
and
there
may
be
many
reasons.
do
we
want
a
third
one,
where--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let's
say
they
pass
this...
and
it's
"unusual"?
i
mean,
we're
going
to
get
several
categorizations
and
shadings
of
statutes.
i
don't
have
an
answer.
i'm
not
suggesting
a
point
of
view
on
this.
i'm
curious
what
you
think.
