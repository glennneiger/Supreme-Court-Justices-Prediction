justice
david
h.
souter
but
that...
it
could
be
remanded
sua
sponte
for
any
number
of
reasons,
so...
so,
you're
saying
not
that
there
is
some
wiggle
room
to
allow
"may"
to
operate,
you're
simply
saying
it
depends
on
the
party
that
initiates
the
remand.
and
i
guess
my
question
is,
could
you
give
us
an
example,
or
examples,
of
a
remand
on
a
party's
motion,
on
a
plaintiff's
motion,
in
which
the
fees
would
not
be
allowed?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
doesn't...
why
doesn't
that
also
go
for
counsel
fees?
i
mean,
there
are
expenses
in
discovery,
but
there...
there's
counsel
time
in
discovery.
so,
wouldn't
the
same
rule
apply?
