justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question?
i
never
had
one
of
these
problems
when
i
was
in
practice,
so
it's
all
new
to
me.
but,
"an
order
remanding
the
case
may
require
payment
of
just
costs
and
any
actual
expenses,
including
attorneys
fees,
incurred
as
a
result
of
the
removal.
"
does
that
mean
that
if,
after
the
removal...
there
are
substantial
proceedings
in
the
trial
court,
in
an
appeal,
and
so
on,
and
then
you
suddenly
discover
that
the...
there
was
a
mistake
and
you
remand...
you
can
get
fees
for
all
the
litigation
work
that
took
place
in
the
interim?
it
could
be
a
very
large
sum
of
money,
couldn't
it?
it's
not
just
fees
incident
to
the
fight
over
whether
removal
was
proper.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
that
would--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--conceivably,
could
include
all
sorts
of
discovery
and
arguments
on
motions
and
so
forth
that
might
actually
save
time
in
the
subsequent
proceeding,
if
it
goes
back
to
the
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
judge's
discretion
includes
both
whether
or
not
to
include
any
fees,
and
he
also
has
quite
a
bit
of
discretion
on
what
to
include
in
the
fee
award,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
fogerty
an
example.
isn't
the...
and
what
is
the
standard
that
fogerty
announces?
it
rejects
the
british
rule,
and
that
it
rejects
the
one
favoring...
one
party
over
the
other?
what
is
the
standard
you
get
out
of
fogerty,
other
than
pure
discretion
of
the
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
return
to
fogerty
for
a
minute?
as
i
read
the
footnote
at
the
end
of
the
opinion,
which
you
say
referred
to
the
third
circuit
rule,
it
talks
about,
"nonexclusive
factors
are
permissible".
it
doesn't
say
the
factors
used
by
the
third
circuit
are
the...
you
know,
set
any
particular
standard.
as
i
read
it,
it
leaves
the
discretion
entirely
up
to
the
district
court
to
apply
whatever
reasonable
and
appropriate
factors
seem
correct
in
the
particular
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you're--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
part
of
the
decision
on
which
you
rely
is
the
footnote
at
the
end
of
the
opinion,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
that's
a
correct
statement.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
in
state
courts.
in
1983,
cases
are
subject
to
state
court
jurisdiction,
where
the
plaintiffs
are
trying
to
enforce
a
federal
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
thought
you
said
the
state
court
would
never
be
enforcing
a
federal...
i
may--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
may
have
misunderstood
your
point--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
it
was
an
improperly
removed
case.
