mr.
richard
l.
wolf
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court--
hopefully,
i
can
simplify
this
matter
for
the
court.
as
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
in
our
motion
that
was
recently
filed,
mr.
guzek
does
disclaim
any
reliance
on
the
eighth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
as
a
basis
for
admitting,
at
his
retrial--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
mr.
guzek
does
not
intend
to
rely
upon
the
eighth
amendment,
i
think
that
this
would
moot
the
case
and
that
the...
this
court
could
then
vacate
that
portion
of
the
oregon
supreme
court's
opinion.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
i
respectfully
disagree.
in...
because,
in
fact,
we
didn't
really
argue,
in
the
oregon
supreme
court,
that
we
were
entitled,
necessarily,
under
the
eighth
amendment.
our
argument
was
primarily
under
the
statute,
that
this
statute
says
any
evidence
which
came
in
should
be
admitted
in
the
retrial.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
that--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
that...
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
present
it
under
state
law,
and
we
think
that
is
the
resolution.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
not
necessarily.
i--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
i
think,
under
oregon
law,
we
are
entitled
to
put
on...
well,
first
we
have
to
distinguish
between
these
unitary
juries
and
these
retrial
juries,
because,
of
course,
the
retrial
jury
has
not
heard
the
evidence
from
the
guilt/innocence
phase,
from
the
original
trial.
and
in
the
event
that
a
retrial
jury
is
hearing...
they're
hearing
this
evidence
for
the
first
time,
and
the
state
should
not
be
permitted
to
just
put
on
the
evidence
that
they
think
helps
aggravate
the
case.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
that's
a
potential
argument.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
but
we
think--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
we
think
we're
entitled
to
make
it,
under
oregon
law,
in
a...
regardless
of
whether
we're
entitled
to
make
it
under--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--eighth
amendment.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
i
disagree,
justice
scalia,
because
the
court
has
said
that
this
evidence,
regardless...
with
respect
to
the
grandfather...
regardless
of
its
substance,
is
to
be
admitted.
and
if
it's
to
be
admitted,
it
is
to
be
considered.
the
statute
with--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--which
justice
breyer--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--correct.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
the--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
first
of
all,
we
never
did
argue
doubt.
the
words
"residual
doubt"
never
occurred
in
this...
in
the
trial
court,
they
never
appeared
before
the
oregon
supreme
court.
lingering
residual
doubt
was
never
argued.
but
in
the
hypothetical
case,
the
defendant
is
entitled,
and
the
statute
instructs
the
jury,
to
consider
the
evidence
from
both
phases
of
the
trial
for
all...
for
the
sentencing
purposes.
and
the
oregon
statute
is
sui
generis
in
the
sense
that
we
have
a
statute
that
has
four
questions
the
jury
must
answer
beyond
a
reasonable...
the
first
three
must
be
answered
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
these
are
factual
questions
related
to
the
crime.
did
the
defendant
act
deliberately?
so,
in
essence,
what
we
have
is...
a
case
which
is
charged
as
an
aggravated
murder
does
not
make
the
defendant
death
eligible
at
that
point.
the
defendant
is
not
death
eligible
until
he
is
first
convicted
of
aggravated
murder
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
then,
in
the
penalty
phase,
he
is
found
to
have
committed
the
act
deliberately,
he
is
found
to
have...
the
victim
should
not
have...
did
not
provoke
him,
and
his
response
was
unreasonable
to
that.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
it
has
not--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--no.
no,
your
honor.
those
are
penalty
phase--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--questions.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
no,
you
must
be
found
guilty
of
intentional
murder.
but,
in
the
penalty
phase,
the
very
first
question
in
our
statute,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
of
the
state's
brief,
is
whether
the
conducts
of
the
defendant
that
caused
the
death
of
the
deceased
was
committed
deliberately
and
with
the
reasonable
expectation
that
the
death
of
deceased,
or
another,
would
result.
so,
it's
additional
mental
state,
a
factual
determination,
that
goes
beyond
whether
you
intentionally
caused
death.
that--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
i
don't
disagree
with
you,
your
honor,
and...
however,
our
petition
in
this
matter
was
not
granted.
but
the...
this...
that
is
the...
the
point
is
that
our
statute
is
very
unique.
i
don't
know
of
any
other--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
first
of
all--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to...
clearly,
under
the--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--statute,
to--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--put
on
the
live
testimony
of
the...
of
the--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--of
the
mother.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
the
statute--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
perhaps
not
as
improvidently
granted,
but
if
there
is...
if
the
evidence
comes
in,
under
oregon
law,
and
we
are
disavowing
any
reliance
on
the--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--eighth
amendment--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--right.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--for
us
to
go
into
anything
that
wasn't
raised
in
the
original
trial,
that
would
have
to
be
otherwise
relevant.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
and
so,
for
example,
if--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--if
mom--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
no.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
the
deliberateness,
your
honor...
to
this--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--no,
it...
it's...
additional
evidence
can
be
put
on.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
i
guess
it
depends
on
the
nature
of...
if
it
is
to
impeach
the
codefendant's
testimony,
if
that's
deemed
to
be
additional--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
i
didn't--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
as
a
matter
of
oregon
law,
we
think
we
can...
we
could
put
mom
on,
she
could
testify
verbatim
from
her
original
trial,
and
she
could
be
asked,
or
she
could
say,
"and
i
love
my
son.
"
"please
don't
kill
him.
"
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
the...
it...
i'd
ask--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
it...
the
answer,
your
honor,
is,
i'd
ask
the
court
to
look
to
page
3
of
our
brief,
where
the
statute
is
set
forth,
and
look
carefully
at
the
way
that
statute
is
worded,
which
says,
"either
party
may
recall
any
witness
who
testified
at
the
prior
trial
or
sentencing
proceeding
and
may
present
additional
relevant
evidence.
"
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
no--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
with
all
respect,
the
oregon
supreme
court
did
not
say
residual
doubt
was
admissible.
and
residual
doubt
was
never
argued
to
the
trial
court,
to
the
oregon
supreme
court;
and,
therefore,
whether
or
not
it
can
come
in--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--it
did
say
that.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
but
it's
relevant
to
this
idea
of
deliberation.
for
example,
if
the
defendant...
the
codefendants
have
testified
that
the...
mr.
guzek
is
the
mastermind
of
this,
and
that
he
helped
plan
this.
if
the
alibi
goes
to
whether
or
not
he
was
present
for
all
of
those
events
that
relate
to
this
issue--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--of
deliberation--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--it
could
be.
but
it
could
be
a
different
trial,
such
as
we
would
propose
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--in
the
sense
that--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--right.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
not--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--not
that
the
same
matter.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
but
the...
but
the
factual...
there
are
factual
determinations
to
be
made
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
that
are
a
continuation
of
the
original
trial.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
okay.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
right.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
right.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
right.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
if--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
we
did
put
it
in
the
first
time
in
this
case,
and
we
don't
necessarily
need
to
rely
on
the
eighth
amendment,
we
believe,
to
put
it
in,
if--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--right.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
right.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--if--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--the
constitution
protects
us
in
the
sense
that
it
allows
us
to
rebut
and
respond
and
reply
to
evidence
offered
by
the
state
in
aggravation
of
a
sentence
of
death.
and
if
they're
offering
evidence
that
he
is...
he
acted
deliberately,
we
have
a
right
to
respond
to
that.
we
don't
have
to
sit
there
with
our
hands
tied
behind
our
back.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
and--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
but
it's
also
a
question
of,
"how
much
of
it
was
he
there
for?
"
--as
in
green.
was
he
there
when
he...
was
he
there
for
the
planning
stage?
because
the
jury
is
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence.
so,
if
he--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--i
think
"alibi"
means,
"i
was
somewhere
else
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
"
but
if
what
the
jury--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--has
considered--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--no.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
but
our
statute
requires
the
jury,
in
the
sentencing
phase,
to
make
these
additional
factual
determinations
about
the
offense.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
of
guilt,
but
not
necessarily
of
the...
but
if
the
evidence
of
deliberation
occurred
at
other
events
in
the
chain
of
events,
than
the
alibi
is
relevant
to
the
sentencing
question
the
jury
must
decide.
it's
also
relevant
to...
perhaps,
to
provocation.
so,
there
are
factual
determinations
that
the
sentencing
jury
has
to
make.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
there
was...
there
was
a
timeframe
of...
there
was
evidence
that
they...
the
codefendants
testified
that
the...
the
three
of
them
planned
to
do
another
burglary
of
a
different
house,
and
then...
the
codefendants'
timeframes
are
rather
fuzzy,
but
then
they
went
back,
at
some
point,
to
the
defendant's
father...
house
to
obtain
weapons,
and
then
went
on
to
the
ultimate
victim's
house.
so,
to
the
extent
that
this
deliberation
includes
events
that
occurred
before
the
actual
homicide,
it's
relevant
to
this
deliberation
question.
and,
additionally,
the--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
it
was
a
much
longer
timeframe
than
that.
there
was
testimony
that
they
went
back
to
town,
and
went
to
the
father's
house
and
obtained
weapons
before
they
went
to
the
house
where
the
homicides
occurred.
the
other
issue
is
that
there
has
been
subsequent
evidence,
since
the
first
trial.
these
codefendants
have
recanted
certain
statements.
they
have
recanted--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--yes.
we
believe
that
that's...
we're
entitled
to
do
that
to
rebut--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--not
to...
no,
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
to
alibi.
any
evidence
that
goes
to
the
sentencing
questions
the
jury
must
consider,
to
deliberation,
to--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--absolutely.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
whether
it's
required
under
the
eighth
amendment,
or
not,
is
for
you
to
decide,
obviously,
but
we
think--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--that
it's
whether
or
not
oregon
law
also
requires
it.
and
we
believe,
under
oregon
law,
we're
entitled
to
put
this
on,
we're
entitled
to
rebut
this.
for
example,
justice
kennedy
was
talking
about
a
scenario...
and,
in
this
very
case,
the
joint
appendix,
at
page
92,
the
prosecutor
in
this
case...
this
is
an
excerpt
from
the
trial...
was
trying
to
get
in
evidence
that
the
defendant
was
being
manipulative.
and,
at
this
point,
the
alibi
evidence
had
been
excluded.
and
so,
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
not
taking
responsibility,
perhaps
was
being
deemed
as
manipulating
people
by
trying
to
get
them
to
come
forward
to
say,
"i
wasn't
there",
then
alibi
is
relevant
to
respond...
to
rebut
and
respond
to
that
kind
of
an
argument.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
and
we
think...
we
agree
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
went
farther
than
it
needed
to
in
this
case
in
order
to
decide
the
issue,
because,
under
oregon
law,
mom
testified--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--uh
huh.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
no,
not
as
long
as
the
state
of
oregon
agrees
that
this
statute
operates
in
an
evenhanded
fashion.
in
other
words,
if
they
get
to
recall
witnesses
who
originally
testified,
or
present
transcript
testimony,
then
we
should
have
the
same
right.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
your
honor,
on
the
merits,
we--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
we
think
that
the...
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
decision
was
correct
in...
on
the...
on
the
eighth
amendment.
and
we
think
it's...
but
it's...
not
necessarily
for
the
reasons
stated
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
and
the
fact
is
that
if
the
oregon
supreme
court
held
that
we
have
a
right
to...
we
believe
that
we
have
a
right
to
respond
to
any
evidence
they
offer
on
aggravation.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
well,
we
think
that
if...
by
directing
that
the
jury
consider
all
evidence
in
both
phases
of
the
trial,
it
must
be
relevant.
why
else
would
they
instruct
the
jury
to
consider
such
evidence,
unless
it
was
relevant
to
the
sentencing
questions
that
the
jury
must
answer?
and
obviously
i
agree
with
you,
justice
breyer,
that
if
the...
if
a
defendant
must
run
the
gamut
of
having...
we
have
to
remember
that
the
first
trial
was
set
aside
because
it
was
defective
in
some
way.
and
it
would
be
an
anomalous
result
for
the
resentencing
jury
to
not
be
entitled
to
hear
what
the
first
jury
heard
when
the
defendant
had
an
unconstitutional,
or
a
defective,
trial.
so--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--well,
we
would
intend
to
call
her.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
because
we
think
it's
important--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--yes.
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
and
i'd
like
to
answer
the
reason
for
that,
because
we
think
the
jury
is
entitled
to
see
her
demeanor
and
gauge,
based
on
how
she
testifies,
how
believable
she
is.
we
think
it's
much...
we
think
it's
better
for
a
jury
to
be
able
to
see
a
live
witness
than
hear
a
cold
transcript
being
read
by
surrogates.
and
so,
of
course,
in...
as
we
know,
in...
if
she
were
to
stray
from
what
she
testified
at
the
original
trial,
of
course
she
would
be
impeached
with,
"well,
you
didn't
testify
about
that
the
first
time.
"
but
the
jury,
we
think,
as
the
statute
clearly
indicates,
should
allow
witnesses
who
testified
originally
to
be
recalled,
unless,
for
some
reason,
they're
unavailable--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--in
which
case--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--no.
there--
mr.
richard
l.
wolf
--the
convictions...
well,
the
defect
was
in
the
penalty

and
so,
the
convictions
are
affirmed.
the
jury
is
going
to
be
instructed,
"the
defendant
stands
convicted,
has
been
found
convicted
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
"
it
is
to
decide
these
four
questions,
did
he
act
deliberately?
does
he
constitute
a
future
danger?
and,
to
the
extent
the
government
puts
on
evidence
that
addresses
those
concerns,
we
believe
we
have
the
right
to
respond
to
that.
and
also...
we
also
have
to
remember
that
the...
that
the
alibi
in
this
case
was...
really
was
offered
as
impeachment
of
the
codefendants.
the
codefendants
are
really
the
only
evidence
that
links
the
defendant
to
these
crimes.
and
so,
to
the
extent
that...
it's
impeachment
by
contradiction.
so,
while
they
may
find
that
if
the
codefendants
say,
"he
did
a,
b,
and
c.
"
and
mom
says,
"no,
he
was
with
me.
"
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
was
with
mom,
only
that
they
should
disbelieve
the
codefendants.
and
that
is
a...
although
it
seems
incongruous,
that's
standard
impeachment
by
contradiction.
the
jury
is
given
an
instruction
that
they're
to
consider
it
for
the
limited
purpose
of
whether
or
not
to
believe
the
codefendants,
but
not
necessarily
as
substantive
evidence
of
alibi.
and
that
happens
in
trials
every
day.
so,
we
don't
think
it's
that
unusual
for
the...
if
the
evidence
relates
to
the
sentencing
questions
the
jury
must
consider,
then
it
should
come
in.
so,
the
other
point
that
i
think
is
important
in
this
case
is
that
the...
you
know,
the...
it's
really
not
unlike
this...
cases
that
this
court
has
held,
sumner
versus
shuman,
and
skipper.
if
the
government
puts
on
evidence--
i
see
my
time
is
up.
