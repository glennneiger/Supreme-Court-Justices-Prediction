chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
oregon
versus
guzek.
ms.
williams.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there's
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--reason
that
the
defendant
couldn't
introduce
other
evidence
in
his
resentencing
trial,
is
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
if
he
has
other...
he
says,
"i
have
other
witnesses
that
go
to
the
residual
doubt
question.
"
and
i
would...
you
know,
on
retrial,
if
he
prevails
here,
presumably
he
would
be
entitled
to
put
in
that
evidence,
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
williams.
mr.
shanmugam.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
any
view
on
whether
this
question
is
properly
before
us,
given
the
oregon
statutes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
wolf.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
doesn't
matter.
i
mean,
the
question
is
what
the
oregon
supreme
court
did,
and
it's
quite
clear
that
it
based
its
decision
on
the
eighth
amendment,
not
these
various
provisions
of
oregon
evidence
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
argue
in...
an
eighth
amendment
case
in
the
supreme
court,
you
win
on
the
eighth
amendment,
then
you
leave
the
courthouse
and
say,
"well,
i
don't
want
it
anymore.
"
and
you
think
that
moots
the
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
still
a
decision,
binding
in
this
case,
giving
you
the
right
to
admit
any
evidence
on
residual
doubt
in
the
retrial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
question,
or
doubt,
that
the
state
supreme
court
decision
was
based
on
the
eighth
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
said
that
your
alibi
defense,
that
had
been
rejected
by
the
prior
jury,
was
relevant
under
the
eighth
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
brings
up
a
question
i
have.
particularly
under
the
resentencing
provision,
it
looks
like
the
sentencing
trial
is
going
to
be
just
a
rerun
of
the
guilt
trial,
because
your
main
evidence
that
you
want
to
put
in
is
alibi
evidence,
"i
didn't
do
it".
so,
you're
going
to
say,
"here's"...
the
mother
is
going
to
say,
"i...
he
was
at
home.
"
and
then,
presumably,
the
state
gets
to
put
on
all
of
its
witnesses,
saying,
"no,
here
are
the
people
who
saw
him
do
it.
"
and
blah,
blah,
blah.
and
so,
it's
just
the
same
trial
all
over
again.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
want
to
put
that
in?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
any
new...
any
new
evidence
relevant
to
alibi
or
degree
of
guilt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you...
and
you
want
to
retain
the
right
to
put
in
whatever
evidence
is
relevant
on
those
questions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
what
was
all
the
discussion
about
the
mother's
having...
then,
when
you
go
back,
you
can
put
on
anything,
whether
it
was
presented
before,
or
not,
right?
because
the
eighth
amendment
requires
that,
according
to
the
oregon
supreme
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
williams,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
williams.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
in
no.
