ms.
mary
h.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
eight
amendment
requires
that
a
sentencing
jury
in
a
capital
case
must
consider
mitigation,
which
this
court
consistently
has
defined
as
related
to
a
defendant's
background,
character,
or
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
this
case
has
broadly
construed
circumstances
of
the
offense
to
include
evidence
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
defendant's
guilt.
that
holding
is
not
constitutionally
compelled
and
does
not
further
the
purpose
of
having
the
sentencing
jury
consider
mitigation.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
justice
o'connor,
it
is
possible
that
the
supreme
court
was
not
aware
that
defendant's
mother
had
testified
in
the--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--guilt
phase,
and
that's
because
defendant
did
not
raise
that
issue
in
the
trial
court,
did
not
move
to
have
her
alibi
testimony
admitted
under
the
state
statute
that
would
have
caused
the
court
to
address
her
prior--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--testimony.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
no--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--no,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
that
there
needs
to
be
any
change
in
the
posture
of
the
case
in
order...
in
order
for
the
court
to
address
the
federal
issue,
and
that's
because
the
significance
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
ruling
doesn't
turn
on
whether
someone's
testimony
was
admitted
in
the
guilt
phase,
or
not.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
under
oregon
law,
under
the
majority's
holding
in
this
case
and
the
way
they
dealt
with
the
grandfather's
prior
testimony,
on
remand
defendant
could
have
the
mother's
transcript
from
the
guilt
phase
read,
but
what
would
be
different
about
it
under
the
oregon
supreme
court
holding,
and
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
address,
is
what
they
can
do
with
that
alibi
testimony,
no
matter
what
form
it
comes
in.
and
that's
the
significant
part
of
the
supreme
court
holding.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
i
am
not
sure.
under
the--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--oregon
supreme--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--court
holding,
they
would
certainly
be
free
to
introduce
her
live
testimony.
it's
very
clear
from
the
oregon
supreme
court
decision
that
any
alibi
evidence
comes
in,
and
that's
not
limited
to
evidence
that
was
presented
in
the
guilt
phase,
or
even
witnesses
who
had
been
in
the
guilt
phase.
and...
but
coming
back
to
what
the
court's
holding
focuses
on
is
how
that
alibi
evidence
can
be
used
in
the
remanded
proceeding.
and
not
only
does
it
come
in,
and
the
primary
statute
on...
that
they
dealt
with
for
the
grandfather's
testimony
is
really
a
statute
that
deals
with
admissibility
of
evidence...
prevents
the
parties
from
having
to
go
through
making
foundations
and
other
showings
in
order
to
get
evidence
admitted.
but,
under
the
oregon
supreme
court
holding,
defense
counsel
can
argue,
based
on
that
evidence,
that
the
jury
should
consider
the
possibility
that
defendant
is
innocent,
as
a
mitigating
factor
in
determining
the
sentence.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
justice
breyer,
you
are
correct
on
the
first
part,
but
not
on
the
second
part,
and
that's
because
oregon
supreme
court
unanimously
has
construed
oregon's
law
on
mitigation
to
say
that
what
the
oregon
legislature
intended
was
to
have
as
mitigation
only
those
pieces
that
are
required
by
the
eighth
amendment.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor,
that--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--unless
the
eighth
amendment--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--yes,
your
honor.
and
that's
most
clear,
from
the
dissent,
as
characterizing
the
question
that
the
court
is
addressing.
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
opinion
is
in
the
efficient...
excuse
me...
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition.
and
at
page
68
of
the
appendix
from
the
dissent,
justice
gillette
writes,
"the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
emphasized
wording
of
that
statutorily
required
jury
instruction.
"
referring
to
the
mitigation
question,
"defendant
was
entitled
to
have
the
jury
consider
the
evidence
that
he
proffered.
"
"the
majority
says
he
was.
"
"i
disagree.
"
ms.
mary
h.
williams
yes.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
about
the
argument.
where
i
read...
no,
i
cannot
point
to
specific
language
in
the
majority
opinion
that
says
"and
defense
counsel
gets
to
make
an
argument
based
on
this,
and
the
jury
must
consider
that.
"
that
comes
from
this
court's
case
law
of
how
mitigating
evidence
must
be
treated
once
it
is--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--required
to
be--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--yes,
your
honor,
i...
our
position
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
require
that
as
a
mitigating
factor,
that
that
is
not
one
of
the
circumstances
of
the
offense,
certainly
not...
it
doesn't
go
to
the
defendant's
character
or
background.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
no,
justice
scalia.
in
fact--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--yes,
justice
scalia.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
yes.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
and,
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
primary
reason
that
the
state
is
concerned
with
it
is
because
of
the
broad
holding
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
announced
under...
about
what
eight
amendment
requires.
when
you
combine
that
with
what
this
court
has
said
about
what
that
means
when
evidence
is
mitigating
evidence,
then
i
think
a
necessary
corollary
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
holding
is
that
defense
counsel
does
get
to
make
that
argument,
and
that
the
jury
must--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--be
permitted--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--under
the--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
oregon
supreme
court's
conclusion
is
very
broad,
that
any
alibi
evidence
comes
in,
and,
as
the
dissent
notes,
that
it
also
would
not
be
limited
simply
to
alibi
evidence,
but
any
evidence
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
guilt
verdict
in
this
case
that
would
form
a
basis
for
arguing
that
doubt
about
the
defendant's
guilt
should
be
a
factor
that
the
jury
considers
in
responding
to
the
mitigation
question
that--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--i
think
you
still
have
a
case,
justice
stevens--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--because--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--it's
about
the
right
to
argue
and
what
the
jury
is
told
to
do
with
that.
and
it's
also
that
the
state
is
going
to
have
to
live
with
this
decision
in
other
capital
cases,
and
other
capital
defendants--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--may
not
be
willing
to--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--yes.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
but
i
do
not
believe
that
a
party
can
force
the
court
into
that
position
by
stipulating
that,
although
the
state
supreme
court
holding
permits
it--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--to
do
much
more--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--but
they
would
give
it
up
in
a
way
that
would
basically
lock
the
state
into
a
box.
we
couldn't
get--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--review
here,
we
couldn't
get--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--review.
not
for
this
case--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--that's
correct.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
but
i
think
their
stipulation
would
have
to
have
two
parts...
one,
that
they
wouldn't
put
anything
else
in
that
wasn't
presented
in
the
guilt
phase;
and,
two,
that
they
wouldn't
argue
that,
based
on
that
evidence,
the
jury
should
consider
doubts
about
the
defendant's
guilt
in
deciding
what
the
appropriate
sentence
is.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
not
on
the
mitigation
question,
your
honor.
and
that's
because
of
the
way
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
construed
the
mitigation
question,
and
has
construed
it
to
mean
that
only
that
which
the
eighth
amendment
requires
is
to
be
presented
to
the
jury.
the
legislature
adopted
that
provision
in
response
to
this
court's
mitigation
case
law,
and
that's
what
they
were
intending
to
implement,
and
nothing
more
than
that.
i
think
states
are
free
to
do
more,
but
oregon
has
not,
as
a
matter
of
how
the
oregon
supreme
court
has--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--construed
the
statute--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--justice
breyer,
i'd
point
you
to
the...
an
earlier
part
of
that
same
section
of
the
statute
that
says,
"evidence
may...
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
evidence
may
be
presented
as
to
any
matter
that
the
court
deems
relevant
to
sentence.
"
and
their--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--there...
it
does
serve
a
different
purpose,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that...
when
you
read
the
entire
section,
what
it...
what
it
does
is,
it
says
that,
first
of
all,
parties
may
present
additional
evidence,
if
it's
relevant.
the...
they
cannot
present
repetitive,
or
cumulative,
evidence
that
had
been
presented
earlier.
and
then,
the
court's
supposed
to
inform
that
jury
that
what
had
come
in
the
guilt
phase
may
be
considered
in
the
penalty
phase.
and
so...
and
we've
had
the--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--justice
scalia,
what
it
does
is,
it
allows
the
jury
to
know
that
just
because
something
hasn't
been
re
presented
to
them
in
the
penalty
phase,
but
came
in,
in
the
guilt
phase,
it's
open
for
their
consideration.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
what
it
doesn't
do--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--and,
justice
ginsburg,
other
jury
instructions
will
inform
the
jury
how
to
use
what
evidence.
and
this
does
not
mean
that
evidence
that
has
been
presented
is
relevant
for
any
purpose
that
anybody
wants
to
put
it
to
in
the
guilt
phase.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
no,
sir.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
and
the
guidance
does
come
from
the
other
instructions
that
tell
the
jury
what
the
specific
questions
are
that
they
must
answer
in
the
penalty
phase,
and
what
they
take
into
account
in
answering
those
questions.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
in...
it
has.
and
i
believe
that
in
franklin
versus
lynaugh,
this
court
came
very
close
to
deciding
this
question,
that
residual
doubt
is
not
one
of
those
mitigating
factors.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
there
are
some
factors
that
the
court
has
described
as
being
required
as
appropriate
for
mitigation.
so,
age,
the
mental
state
of
the
individual,
the--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--i
think
certainly
with
respect
to
the
background
and
character
of
the
defendant,
but
the
question
here
would
be
a
fairly
limited
restriction
to
say
that
circumstances
of
the
offense
presume
that
the
offense
has
occurred
and
that
the
defendant
is
guilty;
and
so,
evidence
inconsistent
with
that
guilt
is
not
a
circumstance
of
the
offense.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
justice
scalia,
we
copied
from
text
those...
on
those
special
issues.
and
so,
in
the
guilt
phase,
what
you
have
to
establish
is
that
the
defendant
acted
intentionally.
and
that's
what's
required
as
far
as
the
constitutional
state
of
mind.
and
the
deliberateness
question
is
sort
of
an
intentional
plus.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
it's
from
an
additional--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--finding,
beyond
intentional,
that
the
state
has
to
then
establish
in
the
penalty
phase.
two
quick
points.
first,
on
how
this
evidence
was
offered.
it
was
not
offered
as
impeachment
evidence.
it
was
not
offered
under
any
state
statute.
if
you
look
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
second
volume,
at
page
94
is
the
notice
of
intent
to
rely
on
evidence
of
alibi
as
mitigating
evidence.
and
then
there's
an
accompanying
memo
that
follows.
and,
also,
at
page
88
of
the
joint
appendix,
there's
a
colloquy
between
defense
counsel
and
the
trial
court,
where
defense
counsel
says,
"your
honor"...
and
made
it
very
clear
that
alibi
is
being
offered
as
mitigation.
it
goes
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
it's
mitigating
evidence
that
someone
is
not
there.
and,
later,
circumstances
of
the
offense
is
part
of
the
fourth
question,
which,
in
oregon,
is
the
mitigation
question.
if
the--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--the
mother's
testimony
about
the
time
from--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--2:10
a.m.
to
4:20
is
in
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
and
again
from
the
colloquy,
"if
you're
not
there,
that
is
certainly
mitigating.
"
and
let
me
just
mention,
in
terms
of
the
timing
of
the
alibi
evidence,
the
grandfather's
alibi
covered
from
9
o'clock
at
night
until
2
o'clock
in
the
morning;
the
mother's,
from
2:10
in
the
morning
til
4:20.
the
crimes
occurred
in
the
early
morning
hours.
and
so,
there
isn't
any
way
to
parse
this
out
and
say
that
the
alibi
testimony
might
have
been
relevant,
in
some
small
piece,
on
deliberateness.
to
the
extent
that
the
state
puts
on
additional
evidence
to
establish
deliberateness,
of
course
defendant
can
respond
to
that
additional
evidence,
but
the
state
doesn't
make
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
was
there
wide
open
again
in
the
penalty
phase.
