ms.
williams,
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
all
of
this
discussion
about
what
the...
whether
the
state
law
would
have
produced
the
same
result,
or
not.
we
have
never
held,
have
we,
that,
where
a
state
supreme
court
opinion
clearly
rests
on
a
federal
ground,
a
federal
constitutional
ground,
we
do
not
have
jurisdiction
if
there
is
a
possible
state
ground
that
would
have
left
to...
led
to
the
same
result?
have
we
ever
held
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we've
said
just
the
opposite,
haven't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
if
that
provision
weren't
there,
the
court
would
have
to
decide,
item
of
evidence
by
item
of
evidence,
which
pieces,
that
the
jury
has
already
heard,
were
relevant
to
the
penalty,
and
not
to
the
guilt.
whereas,
by
just
allowing
everything
in,
but
just
telling
the
jury,
"you
only
consider
it
insofar
as
it
goes
to
the
penalty,
and
not
to
the
guilt.
"
we...
the
court
does
not
have
to
enter
into
that
item
by
item
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
the
basis
on
which
the
court
decided
this
case,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
this
is
a
possible
basis
on
which
the
oregon
supreme
court
might
have
decided
this
case.
they
did
not
decide
it
on
that
case...
on
that
ground.
they
decided
that
the
jury
has
to
be
able
to
consider
doubt,
not
because
of
that
provision
of
the
statute,
but
because
of
the
eighth
amendment.
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
has
our
constitutional
law
regarding
the
requirement
of
allowing
the
jury
to
consider
all
mitigating
factors...
the
requirement
that
they
have
to
be
allowed
to
be
take
into
account
of
that...
what
guidance
has
that
provided?
has
our
constitutional
law
said
what
constitutes
a
mitigating
factor?
justice
antonin
scalia
apart
from
that,
apart
from
the
fact
of
whether
the
person's
guilty
or
not,
have
we
specified
what
factors
the
jury
can
take
into
account
by
way
of
mitigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that
if
a
state
listed
specific
factors
that
could
be
taken
into
account,
and
no
others,
that
there
would
be
considerable
doubt
whether
this
court
would
allow
such
a
statute
to
stand?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
you
think...
you
think
the
oregon
supreme
court
might
well
come
out
that
way,
if
it
wished,
although
not
resting
on
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
if
we
vacate
it
and
the
case
is
remanded
on
that
ground,
i
assume
it's
still
open
for
you
to
point
out
to
the
oregon
supreme
court
that
they
were
in
error
about
the...
about
the
status
of
the
testimony
that
you
tried
to
get
in,
and
have
it
admitted
on
that
ground.
why
isn't
that
the
way
to
handle
the
matter,
rather
than
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
you
express
it,
"mooting
the
case"?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that...
there
would
still
remain...
whether
you
mooted
the
case,
or
whether
we
vacated
and
then
it
was
left
to
the
oregon
supreme
court
whether
to
let
this
evidence
in...
there
would
still
remain
the
question
of
what
kind
of
an
instruction
the
jury
can
be
given
regarding
the
consideration
of
this
evidence
for
purposes
not
of
determining
whether
a
guilty
person
should
not
be
given
the
death
penalty,
but,
rather,
for
purpose
of
considering
whether
the
guilt
is
clear
enough.
i
mean,
that's...
that
issue
would
still
remain,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand,
but
what
are
you...
what
are
you
going
to
argue
to
that
jury?
are
you
going
to
argue
to
that
jury,
you
know,
that,
"yes,
my
client
has
been
convicted,
but
the
evidence
of
his
guilt
was
really
not
all
that
clear,
and
you
should
take
that
into.
"
--don't
you
want
to
make
that
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
says
you
can
make
that
argument,
because
the
eighth
amendment
requires
you
to
be
able
to
make
that
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
what
the
state
says
is,
"no,
the
eighth
amendment
requires
no
such
thing.
"
so,
the
issue
hasn't
gone
away.
it's
still
here.
it's
here
in
this
very
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
no,
no.
you're
entitled
to
get
the
evidence
in,
under
oregon
law,
but
the
question
of
how
that
evidence
can
properly
be
used
by
the
jury
has
been
decided
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
only
on
the
basis
of
the
eighth
amendment,
not
on
the
basis
of
any
oregon
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
penalty
phase.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
penalty
phase?
justice
antonin
scalia
hasn't
he
already
been
found
in
the
guilt
phase?
justice
antonin
scalia
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can
be
found
guilty
of
murder
when
you
didn't
intend
to
kill?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
to
be
very
strange,
because
i
think
our
cases
require
that
for
death
eligibility,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
you
told
us
that
additional
evidence
on
deliberation
can
be
put
in
the...
in
the
sentencing
phase.
but
then
you're
saying
that
you're
not
going
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
pass,
if
i
were
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
used
to
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--two
trials.
i
mean,
you
know,
that's
the
whole
problem
here.
your
client
has
been
tried
as
to
whether
he
committed
the
offense,
and
found
guilty,
and
now
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now
you
want
to
relitigate
the
same
matter.
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
on
the
basis
that
the
constitution
requires
you
to
be
able
to
relitigate
the
same
matter
two
times
in
the
same
criminal
proceeding,
that
doesn't
seem,
to
me,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought...
well,
i
guess
it...
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
an
"alibi".
if
all
you
mean
by
an
"alibi"
is
that,
for
part
of
the
offense,
he
was
somewhere...
i
thought
an
alibi
meant,
"i
am
not
guilty,
because
i
was
not
there.
"
that's
what
i
thought
an
alibi
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
general
williams,
i
have
one
question.
i'm
not
sure
it
goes
to
our
eighth
amendment
question
before
us,
but
i
honestly
don't
understand
what
your
statute
is
all
about.
it
says
that
after
having
been
convicted
of
aggravated
murder...
aggravated
murder...
the
sentencing
jury
shall
be
presented
with
the
following
questions.
number
one,
whether
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
that
caused
the
death
of
the
deceased
was
committed
deliberately
and
with
the
reasonable
expectation
that
death
of
the
deceased,
or
another,
would
result.
don't
you
have
to
find
that
in
order
to
convict
of
aggravated
murder?
justice
antonin
scalia
plus,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
gotcha.
