justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
can't
you
under...
look,
first
imagine
that
they
don't
want
to
introduce
one
word
from
the
mother's
mouth
that
isn't
already
in
that
transcript.
imagine
that's
the
circumstance.
if
that's
the
circumstance,
then
i
should
think
there
is
no
doubt,
under
oregon
law,
that
those
words
in
the
transcript
are
admissible.
and
i
believe
that
under
oregon
law...
and
i'm
not
certain...
that,
an
ordinary
case,
a
death
eligible
person
does
have
the
right
to
argue
in
the
sentencing
proceeding.
think
back
over
that
trial
jury
and
you
will
see
that
there
are
doubts
as
to
whether
this
man
is
guilty
or
not.
am
i
right...
am
i
right
on
the
first
part?
am
i
right
on
the
second
part?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
in
other
words,
prior
to
this
case,
in
the
state
of
oregon,
where
there
was
a
death
case...
maybe
there
weren't
very
many,
but
where
there
was
one,
under
oregon
law...
we
have
the
trial;
immediately
thereafter,
the
sentencing,
and
the
lawyer
had
no
right
to
argue,
under
oregon
law.
think
back
about
your
certainty
as
to
whether
this
individual
is
guilty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
did
the
court
say,
here...
the
oregon
court,
in
this
case...
one,
"you
can
introduce
evidence",
which
it
seems
to
have
been
mistaken
about,
about
not
being
there,
but
that,
second,
the
federal
constitution
gives
you
the
right
to
argue
the
residual
doubt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
"consider
the
evidence"
is
different
from
"making
an
argument
about
the
evidence.
"
and
what
i
didn't
see
in
the
argument,
majority
opinion,
is
a
statement
that
not
only
can
this
evidence
be
introduced...
because,
after
all,
in
a
normal
case,
the
jury's
heard
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
the
same
jury.
but
i
didn't
see,
anywhere,
where
they
addressed
the
question
about
what
kind
of
argument
the
defense
had
the
right
to
make
at
the
sentencing
trial
in
respect
to
the
residual
doubt
that
they
might
have
from
what
they
just
heard.
can
you
point,
in
that
opinion,
to
where
they
made
that
statement
that
you
just
said
they
made
about
the
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
isn't
the
thrust
of
my
question,
of
course.
the
thrust
of
my
question
is
that
if,
in
fact,
this
evidence
from
the
mother
comes
in
under
state
law,
it
comes
in
under
state
law,
because...
i
have
the
cite;
you
know
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--section
i'm
referring
to.
if
it
comes
in
under
state
law,
and
they're
not
trying
to
prove
anything
else,
and
the
holding
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
is
about
what
evidence
is
admissible,
and
not
about
what
arguments
to
be
made,
i
don't
see
what
reason
we
would
have
to
reach
an
issue
that
isn't
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
oregon
revised
stat
163.150?
it
says,
"in
a
capital
sentencing
proceeding,
the
court
shall
instruct
the
jury
that
all
evidence
previously
offered
and
received
may
be
considered
for
purposes
of
the
sentencing
hearing.
"
now,
that's
oregon
law.
it's
long
been
there.
what
possible
reason
could
oregon
have
for
having
that
provision,
which
is,
"jury,
you
shall
consider
all
the
evidence
you've
just
heard
at
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial?
"
what
reason
could
that
be?
how
is
it
supposed
to
be
relevant,
"all
evidence",
unless
it's
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
doubt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
a
different
provision.
i'm
now
thinking
of
the
"normal
case",
where
you
hear
the
guilt
phase,
and
now
we're
in
the
sentencing
phase,
and
it
says
here,
under
oregon
law,
"judge,
tell
the
jury
that
everything
they
previously
heard
at
the
guilt
phase
they
may
consider
for
purposes
of
what
sentence
they
should
impose.
"
i
just
wonder
what
that
sentence
is
doing
there
in
oregon
law,
unless
the
jury
is
supposed
to
think
about
whether
this
guy's
really...
"i'm
completely
certain
he's
guilty".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
under--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oregon
law,
what
is
not
clear
is...
you
want
to
put
the
mother
on
the
stand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
do
you
want
to
go
into
anything
at
all
that
wasn't
raised
at
the
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
right.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
why
i
want
to
know
that.
that's
what's
ambiguous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
you
only
get
to
go
into
something
if
it
was
not
otherwise...
if
it
is
otherwise
relevant;
and,
therefore,
if
you
want
to.
the
reason
they
think
it
is
relevant
is
because
of
a
constitutional
holding
of
the
oregon
supreme
court.
so,
if
you
want
to
go
into
something,
we
have
to
decide
whether
it
is,
or
is
not,
otherwise
relevant.
if
you
want
to
ask
the
same
thing,
that's
just
a
question
of
whether
you
have
to
have
a
transcript
or
a
live
witness.
and
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
question
that
depends
on
their
constitutional
holding.
so,
i
want
to
know,
do
you
want
to
go
into
things
that
are
not
there
in
the
original
trial,
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i...
look,
until
this
minute,
you
might
have
been
equivocal.
you're
quite
right,
i
was
leading
you.
[laughter]
now,
that
doesn't
mean
you
can't
say
yes
or
no.
you
can
decide
right
now.
so,
decide.
and
i'm...
i
will
be
bound
by
the
answer,
as
i
think
we
all
are.
and
if
your
answer
is,
"yes,
i
want
to
go
into
otherwise
relevant
things.
"
i'd
like
to
know
that.
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
i
want
to
know
that,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
if
you
pass...
if
you
pass,
i
will
think
you
do.
and
as
long
as
you
do,
i
think
we
have
to
decide
whether
it
is,
or
is
not,
otherwise
relevant.
i'm
being
totally
open
and
honest
with
you.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i'm
not
being
tricky
about
it.
i
want
to
know
if
we
have
to
go
to
the
words
"otherwise
relevant"
in
the
oregon
statute...
"otherwise
relevant",
particularly
in
respect
to
this
question
of
residual
doubt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
really
would
like
an
answer,
if
possible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
and
they
said
that
relevance
is...
of
residual
doubt
is
relevant.
and
the
reason
that
it's
relevant
is
because
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
the
jury
to
hear
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
what
i
am
focusing
on,
and
i
want
to
know
if
you
want
to
go
into
"otherwise
relevant",
for
that
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so,
let's
go
to
the
constitutional--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--issue.
now,
let's
imagine
we
have
a
trial.
and
at
the
trial,
we
have
a
lot
of
evidence
about
the
alibi.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
the
state
court
says,
"this
is
our
law.
"
"when
a
person
is.
"
--now
go
to
the
sentencing
phase,
the
jury
has
heard
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay?
so,
they
take
it
into
account.
and,
moreover,
we
tell
them
they
have
to
consider
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay?
that's
a
state
law.
now,
what
happens
when
there's
an
appeal
in
the
middle,
and
now
we
go
back
to
the
sentencing?
here's
what
we
do.
we
introduce
the
transcripts.
and,
moreover,
we
introduce
some
live
witnesses
to
say
what
they
said
before,
but
nothing
else.
now,
you're
saying
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
present
an
additional
witness
on
the
matter
that
has
already
been
litigated
to
go
into
things
that
were
not
there
in
the
trial
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
my
goodness,
if
you
had
real
evidence
of
an
alibi,
why
didn't
you
put
it
in
the
first
time?
and
if,
in
fact,
you...
it's
not
such
good
evidence,
and
so
forth,
why
does
the
state
have
to
have
waste
its
time
to
hear
some
more
about
the
alibi
that
you
didn't
put
in
the
first
time?
i
mean,
you
know,
that's
what
you're
saying
the
constitution
protects.
i'm
being
a
little
skeptical.
i
want
to
know
what
your
answer
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
agreeing
with
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--insofar
as
you
have
a
right
to
put
in
what
you've
put
in
the
first
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you
on
that
one.
but
you
said
you
wanted
to
do
something
else.
you
wouldn't
say,
"we
don't
want
to
do
something
else.
"
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--want
to
do
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
in
the
"more"
part,
where
does
the
constitution
protect
you?
i'm
willing
to,
at
least
hypothetically,
go
with
you
on
the
protection
for
what
they
already
heard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about...
what
about...
for
example,
the
single
most
important
feature
leading
juries
to
recommend
against
death,
apparently,
from
the
studies,
is
their
residual
doubt.
every
juror
who
hears
sentencing
matters
directly
after
a
trial
automatically
takes
that
into
account.
therefore,
those
who
are
resentenced
and
have
a
new
jury
should
have
the
same
kind
of
right.
otherwise,
it's
cruel
and
unusual.
now,
i
have
made
that
argument.
you
didn't
make
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
several
arguments
that
you
might
make
in
favor
of
the
oregon
supreme
court's
approach
if,
at
least,
you
concede
that
it
is
up
to
oregon
to
control,
through
its
evidentiary
rules,
whether
a
matter
is
relevant,
what
form
it
comes
in,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
2:16
a.m.
alarm
clock
in
the
original
trial,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
a
capital
case.
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
ordered
a
new
sentencing
proceeding
after
reviewing
the
case,
and
the
respondent,
who
is
the
defendant,
randy
lee
guzek,
wants
to
introduce
at
that
new
sentencing
proceeding
some
new
testimony
from
his
mother
tending
to
show
that
he
had
an
alibi
for
the
night
of
the
crime
and
consequently
didn’t
commit
the
crime
itself.
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
read
several
cases
from
this
court;
namely,
lockett
v.
ohio,
eddings
v.
oklahoma,
green
v.
georgia.
it’s
read
those
cases
as
holding
that
guzek
has
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
introduce
his
mother’s
evidence
about
alibi
at
the
new
sentencing
proceeding.
we
do
not
agree
about
that
with
the
oregon
supreme
court.
in
our
view,
the
cases
to
which
oregon
refers
do
not
provide
guzek
with
the
right
to
introduce
alibi
evidence
at
a
new
sentencing
proceeding.
indeed,
in
a
later
case
called
franklin
v.
lynaugh,
this
court
specifically
said,
“we
have
not
decided
whether
the
constitution
grants
a
capital
defendant
the
right
to
introduce
at
sentencing
evidence”,
like
the
alibi
evidence,
“designed
to
cast
a
residual
doubt
on
his
guilt
of
the
basic
crime
of
conviction”.
the
court,
then,
in
franklin
itself
didn’t
decide
the
question,
and
like
that
court,
today
we
don’t
decide
the
question.
the
reason
we
don’t
decide
that
are
more
important
residual-doubt
question
is
that
even
if
there
is
some
kind
of
right
like
that,
three
circumstances
taken
together
make
it
plain
that
guzek
lacks
a
constitutional
right
to
introduce
the
new
alibi
evidence
that
is
at
issue
here.
now,
first,
like
all
residual-doubt
evidence,
this
alibi
evidence
concerns
whether
guzek
committed
the
crime,
not
how
he
committed.
sentencing
normally
is
about
the
opposite,
namely,
how
a
defendant
committed
the
crime,
not
whether
he
did
so;
that’s
a
matter
normally
for
the
trial;
second,
a
court,
namely
the
court
that
convicted
guzek,
has
already
considered
this
alibi
claim
and
rejected
it
and
the
law
does
normally
can
discourage
collateral
attacks
on
matters
that
are
previously
decided;
and,
third
--
and
this
is
special
in
this
case
--
oregon
law
allows
guzek
to
introduce
at
the
new
sentencing
hearing
all
of
the
evidence
he
introduced
earlier
at
the
trial.
he
introduced
alibi
evidence
then;
he
can
reintroduce
it
now.
of
course,
what
he
wants
to
do
is
to,
at
this
re-sentencing
hearing,
introduce
some
new
and
different
alibi
evidence,
evidence
that
is
far
as
we
have
been
told
he
could
have
introduced,
but
did
not
introduce,
at
his
original
trial.
a
state
can
set
reasonable
limits
upon
the
evidence
a
defendant
can
submit
at
sentencing,
and
it
can
control
in
a
reasonable
way
the
manner
of
submission.
we
see
nothing
unreasonable
about,
in
effect,
telling
guzek
to
introduce
that
evidence
the
first
time
or
not
at
all.
for
these
reasons,
we
conclude
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
grant
guzek
the
evidentiary
right
he
claims
here,
and
we
reverse
the
oregon
supreme
court’s
contrary
determination.
there
is
also
a
motion
to
dismiss
our
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
which
we
do
not.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
our
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
improvidently
granting
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
thomas
has
joined
justice
scalia;
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
this
case.
