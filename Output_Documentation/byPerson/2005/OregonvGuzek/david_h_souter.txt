justice
david
h.
souter
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but,
based
on
what
you
have
just
said,
which
was
my
understanding,
too,
assuming
the
oregon
supreme
court
made
the
assumption
that
the
mother's
testimony
had
not
been
admitted
at
prior
trial,
the
only
thing
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
was
ruling
on
was
the
admissibility
of
new
testimony,
and
the
use
to
which
new
testimony
could
be
put,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
the
other
side
says,
"we
totally
give
up
any
claim
to
introduce
new
testimony.
"
then
don't
we
have
a
jurisdictional
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
we--
justice
david
h.
souter
--have
not,
but
it's
possible
for,
it
seems
to
me...
for
all
we
know,
it's
possible
that
oregon
could
say,
"look,
we
have
a
statute
that
says
everything
that
was
introduced
at
trial
may
be
considered.
"
"that
may
be
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing,
but
that's
what
our
statute
says,
and
they
may
consider
it.
"
"but
when
the
question
comes,
what
new
evidence
may
be
admitted
at
the
sentencing
hearing...
the
sentencing
phase
only,
then
we're
going
to
restrict
that
only
to
evidence
which,
in
our
view,
is
required
by
the
eighth
amendment.
"
so,
if
that
is,
then...
we
don't...
i
don't
know
whether
the
oregon
supreme
court
took
that
view,
or
not.
but
if
it
did
take
that
view,
and,
in
this
case,
the
respondents
say,
"we
no
longer
want
to
introduce
any
new
evidence.
"
then
we
would
not
have
a
case
left,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
do
you
intend
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
wolf,
in
view
of
the
direction
this
discussion
is
going
in,
i
want
to
go
back
to
something
that
i
really
think
we
all
thought
we
had
passed
but
i
would
like
to
go
back
and
get
clear
on.
my
recollection
is
that
you
stated,
in
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
that
you
currently
maintain
that
you
have
a
right
to
recall
the
mother
to
the
stand
at
the...
at
the
sentencing
proceeding.
my
question,
which
is
prompted
by
your
motion...
my
question
is,
is
it
your
present
intention
to
call
the
mother
to
the
stand,
or
is
it
your
present
intention
to
use
the
mother's
testimony,
which
we
all...
i
understand
to
be
admissible?
are
you
going
to
call
her,
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
do
intend
to
call
her.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
not
asking
why.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
you
are.
and
your
representation
to
me
is
that
you
do
intend
to
call
her
as
a
live
witness
as
the...
at
the
resentencing.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
