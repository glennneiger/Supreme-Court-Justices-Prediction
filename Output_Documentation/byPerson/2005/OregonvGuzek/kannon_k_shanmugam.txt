mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
it
does
not
constitute
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
prohibit
a
capital
defendant
from
relitigating
his
guilt
at
sentencing.
contrary
to
the
reasoning--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--mr.
chief
justice,
our
view
is
that
this
court
certainly
could
reach
the
constitutional
question
presented.
and,
indeed,
there
are
good
reasons
that
this
court
should.
the
oregon
supreme
court
squarely
confronted,
and
resolved,
the
federal
constitutional
question,
and
it
is
ripe
for
this
court's
review.
it
is
true,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested
at
the
outset,
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
appears
to
have
been
laboring
under
a
factual
misimpression...
namely,
that
respondent's
mother
did
not
testify
at
the
initial
trial.
that
having
been
said,
it
appears
to
be
clear
that
respondent
was
seeking...
and
is
still
seeking,
even
before
this
court...
to
introduce
the
live
testimony
of
his
mother.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
and
the--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
do
think--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
that
we
would
agree
with
the
state
of
oregon
that
a
necessary
implication
of
the
oregon
supreme
court's
holding,
albeit
unstated,
was
that
a
defendant
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
argue
residual
doubt,
as
well
as
to
present
evidence
of
residual
doubt.
were
that
not
true,
the
failure
to
admit
the
evidence
would,
in
some
sense,
be
harmless,
since
it
is
true,
certainly
to
some
extent,
that
the
mere
presentation
of
the
evidence
might
lead
to
the
jury
taking
it
into
account
even
absent
an
argument
or
instruction
to
that
effect.
but,
as
a
practical
matter,
this
court
has
never
distinguished,
in
its
consideration
of
mitigating
factors,
between
the
presentation
of
argument
or
evidence
and
obtaining--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--an
instruction--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
true,
to
some
extent,
justice
souter,
but
i
do
think
that...
at
least
with
regard
to
the
question
of
what
factors
are
relevant
to
the
ultimate
determination,
that
is
governed
by
a
quite
different
statutory
provision.
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
construed
that
provision
to
limit
the
mitigating
factors
that
the
jury
can
take
into
account
to
those
that
are
mandated
by
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
and
i
would
further
note--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--yes,
certainly.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
acceptance
of
responsibility
may
present
different
issues,
but
we
would
submit
that
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
constitutional
rule
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
did
expressly
adopt
is
that
it
would
effectively
allow
jurors,
at
their
discretion,
to
apply
what
is
a
higher
standard
of
proof
at
capital
sentencing
than
the
reasonable
doubt
standard,
which,
after
all,
is
the
standard
that
applies
in
all
other
criminal
contexts.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
the
jury
did--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
the
jury
did
determine,
at
the
guilt
phase,
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
the
fundamental
point
of
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
is
that
it
is
the
highest
standard
of
law...
of
proof
known
to
the
law,
short
of
absolute
certainty.
and
i
think,
turning
to
this
court's
case
law
in
the
mitigation
area,
this
court
has,
time
and
time
again,
limited
mitigating
evidence
to
evidence
concerning
the
character
or
record
of
the
defendant
and
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
and
the
reason
for
that,
i
think,
is
that
the
very
concept
of
mitigating
evidence
really
does
presuppose
that
the
defendant
has
committed
the
crime
in
the
first
place.
to
put
it
another
way,
mitigating
evidence
is
evidence
that
suggests
that
a
defendant
who
has
committed
the
crime
is
somehow
less
deserving
of
the
death
penalty.
and
going
back
to--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
we
believe
that
that
would
be
permissible.
and
i
think,
going
back
to
the
joint
opinion
in
woodson
versus
north
carolina,
which
was
really
where
this
constitutional
requirement
of
mitigation
was
first
recognized,
this
court
did
not
suggest
in
any
way
that,
to
the
extent
that
individualized
consideration
at
sentencing
is
mandated,
a
jury
is
entitled
to
consider
any
and
all
factors
that
it
might
think
is
relevant.
instead,
the
court
really
recognized
a
category
of
mitigating
factors
that
is
limited
to
factors
that
are
traditionally
taken
into
account
at
sentencing...
namely,
the
character
or
record
of
the
defendant
and
the
circumstances--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--of
the
offense.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--as
a
practical
matter,
it
may
be
very
difficult
to--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--prevent
it.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
necessarily
desirable
for
jurors
to
do
that.
and
there
is
some
suggestion,
in
the
empirical
evidence,
that
what
actually
goes
on
in
the
jury
room
is
that
jurors
with
some
level
of
doubt
about
a
defendant's
guilt
will
actually
negotiate
with
other
jurors
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
is
convicted,
but
ends
up
not
being
sentenced
to
death.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
justice
ginsburg,
the
model
penal
code
does
say
that.
it
was
adopted,
i
think,
in
1962.
and
i
think
that
it
is
telling
that,
in
the
years
since
1962,
since
this
court
recognized
that
the
death
penalty
was
constitutional
again
in
the
1970s,
no
state
has
expressly
adopted
a
statute
that
permits
consideration
of
residual
doubt
in--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--to
be
sure,
there
are
courts
in
several
states...
i
think
we
identified
seven
in
our
brief--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
have--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--recognized--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg,
just
as
it
would
be
up
to
the
states,
at
their
discretion,
to
decide
to
simply
adopt
a
higher
standard
of
proof
across
the
board
in
capital
cases.
a
state
could
certainly
decide
to
adopt
an
absolute
certainty
standard.
but
i
think
my
point
is
simply
that
no
state
has
expressly
permitted
consideration
of
residual
doubts.
courts
have
construed
statutes
in
some
states
to
permit
it,
typically
because
those
state
statutes
contain
broad
language
either
with
regard
to
the
definition
of
"mitigating
factors"
or
with
regard
to
the
discretion
the
jury
has
in
making
the
ultimate
sentencing
determination.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
might
come
out
that
way
with
regard
to
the
right
of
a
defendant
to,
say,
argue
residual
doubt?
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
there's
no
indication
of
that
on
the
face
of
the
opinion.
and
i
think
that,
in
some
sense,
it
would
be
quite
difficult
for
the
oregon
supreme
court
to
do
that,
having
construed
the
statute
that
governs
the
determination
that
the
jury
actually
makes
at
sentencing,
to
limit
the
factors
that
the
jury
can
consider
to
those
that
this
court
has
recognized
are
constitutionally
mandated
under
the
eighth
amendment.
so,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
the
oregon
supreme
court's
reasoning
in
this
case
really
forecloses
that
interpretation.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
court
vacate
the
decision--
thank
you.
