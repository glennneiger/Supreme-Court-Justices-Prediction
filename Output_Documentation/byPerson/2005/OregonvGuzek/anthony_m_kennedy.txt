justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
may...
i
want
you,
perhaps,
to
elaborate
on
that,
as
well.
and
perhaps
the
respondent
is
the
one
to
answer
this
question.
do
you
understand
that
they,
on
remand,
if
they
prevail
in
this
case,
would
want
to
introduce
the
mother's
live
testimony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
not
sure--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
want
us
to
hold
that.
you
want
us
to
say
that
a
defense
counsel
can
be
admonished
by
the
judge
not
to
make
the
argument
that,
"ladies
and
gentlemen,
this
is
the
final
penalty.
"
"my
client
claims
he's
innocent.
"
"if,
in
20
years,
it
turns
out
that
there
is
evidence
exonerating
him,
it
will
be
too
late.
"
"i
want
you
to
consider
that
and
give
him
life.
"
you
can't
make
that
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--ask
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--on
that
substantive
point,
it
does
seem...
i
assume
a
governor
could
take
this
into
account
in
clemency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
the
governors
can
do
more
than
juries
can.
but,
still,
it
seems
odd
to
me
that
a
jury
cannot
consider
that
this
is
a
close
case.
it's
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
of
course.
it
goes
at
least
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
obdurate
in
not
accepting
guilt.
he
says,
"i
didn't
do
it".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
no,
the
evidence
goes
to
explain
why
the
defendant
is
taking
the
position
that
he
does.
he
said,
"i
wasn't
there".
now,
it's
true,
the
jury,
in
the
guilt
phase,
found
that
he
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--at
least
it
explains
his
attitude,
his
demeanor,
his
refusal
to
accept
responsibility.
there's
a
reason
for
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
would
follow
from
that,
that
if
a
state
wanted
to
exclude
the
defense
evidence
on
alibi
from
a
sentencing
jury's
consideration...
let's
assume
it's
a
new...
a
new
sentencing
jury...
they
could
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
that
answer,
in
light
of
the
previous
discussion
about
the
deliberate...
deliberately.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
oregon
courts
take
the
position
that,
in
the
sentencing
phase,
the
"deliberately"
requirement
must
be
judged
just
by
what
was
then
introduced
in
the
guilt
phase?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought--
