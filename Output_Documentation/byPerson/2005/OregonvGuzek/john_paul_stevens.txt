but
what
do
we
do
with
the
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
your
opponent
acknowledges
that...
or
stipulates,
in
effect,
that
he's
not
going
to
put
anything
in
except
what's
already
in
the
transcripts?
then
do
we
have
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
the
right
to
argue?
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but
our--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--jurisdiction
is
limited
to
reviewing
a
final
judgment
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
can't
give
an
advisory
opinion
which
would
tell
you
what
to
do
in
other
cases,
which...
if
that's
all
it
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
they're--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
would
be
giving
up
the
right
that
you
claim
you
don't
want
them
to
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
other
cases--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
not
for
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
i'm
concerned
that
perhaps
we're
being
confronted
with
a
request
for
an
advisory
opinion.
i
don't
know.
maybe
they
haven't
categorically
agreed
to
what...
they
may
be
going...
willing
to
say
that
they
aren't
going
to
put
anything
else
in.
i
don't
really
know
that
yet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
may...
we
may
not
have
held
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
make
that
argument,
but
do
you...
do
you
think
that
the
state...
that
you
did...
you
don't
think
they
could
even
make
the
argument
as
a
matter
of
state
procedure
or
anything
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that's
true--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
respect
to
putting
in
new
evidence.
i
understand
your
point.
but
there...
as
a
realistic
matter,
do
you
think
it's
possible
to
prevent
a
juror
from
deciding,
"i
thought
it
was
really
a
closer
case
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt;
and
so,
i'm
a
little
hesitant
about
the
death
penalty?
"
there's
no
way
to
prevent
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--from
happening.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
two
questions,
if
i
may.
one...
of
course,
that
wouldn't...
the
alibi
evidence
would
already
have
been
rejected,
whether
there
was
deliberateness
or
not,
so
that
would
not
support
putting
in
the
alibi
evidence.
but
the
second
question
i
have...
i
wanted
to
be
sure
we're
clear
on...
do
you
intend,
on
the
future
hearing,
to
introduce
anything
other
than
the
transcript
of
the
prior
proceeding?
do
you
intend
to
introduce
live
witnesses
under...
as
you
may,
perhaps,
be
able
to,
under
oregon
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
got
the
impression,
from
your
motion
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
that
you
did
not.
but
i
don't
see
anything
unequivocally
establishing
that
in
the
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
put
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
there
definitely
is
a
case
before
us,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
there
was
really
no
basis
for
your
motion
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
if
that's
true.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
you
know,
we're
being
asked
to
decide
whether
oregon
supreme
court
correctly
interpreted
the
federal
constitution.
and
you
seem
to
be
making
most
of
your
argument
to
the
effect,
"well,
we
don't
really
need
that
holding.
"
"we
can
prevail
on
oregon
law.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
going
to
make
any
argument
in
support
of
the
decision
made
by
the
oregon
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
wolf,
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
had
misunderstood
something.
there's
going
to
be
a
new
sentencing,
but
there
also
is
going
to
be
a
new
trial,
is...
on
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why...
because
you
mentioned,
earlier,
about
the
defect
in
the
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
okay.
