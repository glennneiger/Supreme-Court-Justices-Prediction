is
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--possible
that
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
misapprehended
some
of
the
facts
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--need
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
for
that,
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
we
just
go
ahead
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
under
oregon
law,
is
it
possible
that
some
of
the
mother's
testimony
would
be
otherwise
admissible
at
the
penalty
stage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
considered--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
what?
that's
the
problem.
i
mean,
here
is
someone
who's
been
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
don't
see
how
it's
relevant
to
go
in
at
sentencing
and
say,
"oh,
but
there
are
all
these
doubts.
"
i
mean,
by
finding
"beyond
a
reasonable
doubt",
there
isn't
a
reasonable
doubt
left.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you...
i
don't
see
how
that's
open
to
argument.
you
can
say,
"consider
the
evidence
that
shows
he's
a
good
person
underneath
it
all.
"
or,
"there...
he
has
some
moral
values
that
ought
to
be
respected.
"
or
something
like
that,
or,
"he's
capable
of
doing
good
things.
"
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
argue
doubt.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
sounds--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--like
you're
trying
to
relitigate
that
question
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
and,
certainly,
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
require
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
to
the
extent
the
oregon
supreme
court
thought
that,
and
rested
its
holding
on
that,
we
ought
to
reject
it
out
of
hand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
up
to
the
court,
on
remand,
but
it
ought
to
be
straightened
out
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
require
relitigation
of
where
the
defendant
was
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
that
was
the
basis
for
the
"beyond
a
reasonable
doubt"
finding
of
guilt.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
is--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
odd.
it...
almost
as
though
we
should
appoint
some
amicus
here,
counsel,
to
argue
in
support
of
the
merits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
you
don't
seem
to
be
doing
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
very
strange.
