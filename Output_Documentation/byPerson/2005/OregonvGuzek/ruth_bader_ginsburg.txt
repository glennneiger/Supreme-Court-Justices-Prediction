justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--without
any
clue
whether
there's
a
relevance
test?
i
mean,
here
we're
talking
about
alibi
evidence.
if
the
determination
of
guilt
is
final,
then
alibi
is
irrelevant
at
the
penalty
stage.
that's
why
i
found
that
statute
so
puzzling,
that
the
jury
doesn't
have
a
clue.
they're
told,
"everything
from
the
guilt
phase
comes
in,
you
can
consider.
"
but
it
doesn't
sort
out,
doesn't
even
tell
them,
relevance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
wasn't
suggesting
anything
other
than
what
justice
scalia
said,
but
i
was
just
curious
about
this
statute
that
tells
the
jury,
"you
can
consider
everything",
and
gives
them
no
guidance,
because
some
of
it
might
be
quite
inappropriate
for
them
to
consider.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's...
used
on
the
other
side
and
as
a
policy
model,
the
model
penal
code,
i
think,
says
it's
okay.
it...
not
really
that
it's
okay.
it
should
be
considered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
are
a
number
of
states
that
do--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--position
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
it's
up
to
the
states,
i
take
it,
but
it's
not
compelled
by
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--response
is
that
he
wasn't
there.
it's
one
thing
to
say,
"it
was
intentional,
but
did
it
include
deliberate?
"
the
other
thing
is
to
say,
"he
wasn't
there.
"
"he
didn't
commit
the
crime
in
the
first
place.
"
those
are
two
quite
different
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
put
it...
make
it
concrete
for
this
case?
because
i
don't
see
that
there
would
be...
i
mean,
if
the
action
is
intentional,
and
the
question
was
whether
it
was
deliberate,
what
planning
here
would
have
gone
on
in
some
different
timeframe?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
still
don't...
i
still
don't
understand.
you
say
that
there
was...
there
had
to
be
proof
for
conviction
and
guilt...
of
guilt
of
intentional
conduct.
and
this
is
a
simple
story
that's
told,
they
wanted
to
go
to
one
house,
too
many
lights
on
in
that
house;
they
were
frustrated,
they
wanted
to
go
someplace
else,
so
they
came
upon
the
aunt
and
uncle
of
the
defendant's
former
girlfriend.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever
oregon
law
might
say,
or
not
say,
it
appears
that
this
supreme...
oregon
supreme
court
was
acting
under
what
it
thought
was
the
compulsion
of
the
eighth
amendment.
if
it's
wrong
about
that,
you
can
make
your
argument
about
what
oregon
law
should
be,
without
any
eighth
amendment
constraint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
does
seem
that
this
court
was
operating
on
the
assumption
that
the
eighth
amendment
required
it
to
let
in
this
alibi
and
other
evidence.
