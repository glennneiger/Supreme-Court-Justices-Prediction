mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
mullane,
this
court
held
that
due
process
requires
that
notice
efforts
conform
to
what
a
person
who
actually
desires
to
provide
notice
would
do
under
the
circumstances.
such
a
person
would
not
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
return
of
an
initial
mailed
notice,
but
would
consider
reasonable
follow
up
steps
to
provide
that
notice.
where
valuable
real
property
is
at
stake
and
the
state
learns
that
its
initial
effort
has
failed,
the
state
should
do
two
things.
first,
it
should
search
readily
available
sources
for
a
better
mailing
address
and
resend
the
notice,
and
second,
if
a
better
address
cannot
be
readily
ascertained
or
the
second
notice
also
fails,
the
state
should
post
a
notice
on
the
property
or
contact
the
occupants.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
justice
scalia,
in
a
case
like
this
where
there's
valuable
real
property,
regular
mail
would
not
be
sufficient
to
comply
with
due
process,
and
the
reason
why
is
this.
a
reasonable
person
who
actually
desires
to
give
notice
will
use
certified
mail
for
the
information
that
comes
back
to
the
sender.
then
the
sender
either
knows
the
notice
has
been
received
and
they
can
stop
with
confidence,
or
they
know
that
they
have
failed
and
there's
still
time
to
take
reasonable
follow
up
steps.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--yes,
but
justice
scalia,
the
state,
once
informed
that
the
letter
had
never
reached
mr.
jones,
did
nothing.
the
state
was
indifferent
to
the
information
that
came
back.
so,
in
fact,
what
the
state
did
here
was
no
better
than
sending
regular
mail
because
they
ignored
the
information
that
came
back
from
the
use
of
certified
mail.
and,
in
fact,
had
they
used
regular
mail,
it
might
have
been
better
for
mr.
jones.
now,
we're
here
in
this
case
to
discuss
what
due
process--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--well--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--well,
the
context
was
very
different
in
mullane
because
in
mullane
there
was
a
large
number
of
interested
parties
with
very
small
interests
in
a
trust,
and
what
they
were
being
given
notice
of
was
an
accounting
to
settle
those
trusts.
and
as
long
as
some
of
the
people
who
were
similarly
situated
received
notice,
they
could
act
in
a
way
that
would
protect
other
members
of
the
class.
here,
we're
talking
about
real
property
with
just
a
single
owner,
and
in
this
case,
where
we
have
an
$80,000
house
that
was
lost
and
sold
for
only
$21,000,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
due
process
would
require
more
than
just
regular
mail.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
but
what
mullane
announced
is
that
the
government
must
use
reasonable
diligence
to
ascertain
an
address
where
it
can
be
found.
in
this
case,
we
don't
quarrel--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--well,
that's
right.
the...
the
party
charged
with
giving
notice
in
mullane
had
an
obligation--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--justice
souter,
i
think
it
is
given
weight
when
we
evaluate
the
reasonableness
of
the
initial
notice
effort,
and
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
state
first
sending
notice
by
certified
mail
to
the
last
address
in
the
state
property
records.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
justice
souter,
i
think
that
there
are
a
couple
of
points
that
need
to
be
made.
one
is
that
mr.
jones'
failure
to
update
his
address
did
not
relieve
the
state
of
its
constitutional
obligation.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
the
answer
is
once
the
state
was
informed
that
the
first
mailed
notice
had
failed,
it
gets
no
significance.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
justice
souter,
it
has
no
significance
once
the
state
is
actually
informed
that
the
notice
has
failed
because
i
think
the
significance
of
the
statute
is
it
increases
the
state's
confidence
in
the
address
that
it's
initially
using.
but
once
the
certified
mail
comes
back
unclaimed,
at
that
point
it
knows
that
the
address
from
1967
in
its
records
and
the
statutory
obligation
to
update
the
address,
that
is
outweighed
by
actual
knowledge
that
in
both
2000
and
2003
the
certified
mail
notices
were
not
received.
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
first
question
about
why
regular
mail
might
actually
have
been
better
in
this
case.
had
regular
mail
been
sent,
we
don't
know
what
would
have
happened.
we
might
not
have
had
the
due
process
challenge
because
the
envelope
would
have
ended
up
in
the
mailbox
at
bryan
street.
it
would
have
been
brought
inside
by
the
occupants,
and
they
may
very
well
have
brought
it
to
mr.
jones'
attention,
the
way
they
did
when
they
received
the
eviction
notice
after
the
redemption
period
had
closed.
but
i
think
the
most
important
factor,
even
if
we
don't
agree
on
whether
certified
mail
was
required
by
the
constitution
in
the
first
instance,
is
that
once
the
government
used
certified
mail,
it
cannot
then
ignore
the
information
that
it
gained
as
a
result
of
that
choice.
this--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--approximately
$6,000
because
the
property
was
sold
for
$21,000.
the
minimum
bid
was
the
assessed
value
of
the
property,
which
in
arkansas
is
20
percent
of
the
fair
market
value.
so
that
was
about
$14,000.
plus
about
$4,000
in
back
taxes,
another
10
percent
in
interest,
and
another
10
percent
in
penalties,
and
some
small,
in
this
instance,
costs
of
notice.
but
that
brings
us
to
an
important
point,
is
that
the
cost
of
notice
and
the
cost
of
a
search
to
find
a
better
address
will
not
be
borne
by
the
state.
it
will
be
borne
either
by
the
owner
as
a
cost
of
redeeming
the
property
or
it
will
be
borne
by
the
purchaser
as
a
cost
of
acquiring
the
property.
so
certainly
here
where
we
have
an
$80,000
house
sold
for
$21,000,
there
was
sufficient
margin
to
allow
for
some
costs
to
find
mr.
jones
so
that
he
could
be
informed
without
making
this
property--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--the
purchaser
served
an
eviction
notice
to
the
property--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--they
should
have
searched
three
categories
of
sources
for
a
better
address
and
then
tried
mail
again.
and
those
three
categories
are
the
state's
own
records,
such
as
the
driver's
license
records
or
voter
registration
rolls;
second,
public
directories
like
the
phone
book
or
an
internet
search
engine;
and
third,
they
should
have
considered
using
commercial
services
such
as
those
that
are
used
by
creditors.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
two
things.
one
is
they
can
look
for
the
gary
jones
that
has
some
tie
to
the
bryan
street
address,
and
certainly--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--no.
i
think
what
is
constitutionally--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--reasonably
diligent
efforts
to
ascertain
a
correct
address
after
the
return
of
the
first
certified
mail
and
how
far--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--justice
stevens,
i
would.
first,
i
think
that
the
state
can
search
for
better
addresses
by
mail.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
but--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--with
real
property,
if
the
owner
has
not
been
notified
by
mail,
absolutely
i
think
they
should
post
notice
on
the
property.
that
is
a
traditional
way--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--it
would
be
constitutionally
sufficient
if
they
posted
a
notice
because
they
could
not
ascertain
a
better
address.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--reasonably
diligent
efforts
to
find
a
better
address
and
if
a
better
address--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--well,
this
court
in
schroeder
v.
city
of
new
york,
i
think,
recognized
that
it's
impossible
to
have
a
mechanical
rule
to
apply
in
every
circumstance.
i
do
think,
though,
that
the--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--well,
they
are,
but
in
this
case,
the
state
knew
within
2
weeks
of
sending
the
initial
mailed
notice
that
it
had
not
been
received.
that
was
3
years
before
the
taking.
so
there
was
sufficient
time
for
the
state
to
take
some
very
minimal
efforts
to
provide
notice.
and
remember,
with
regard
to
posting,
in
this
case
the
state
actually
visited
the
bryan
street
property
and
they
did
not
post
a
notice
or
contact
the
occupants
at
that
time,
although
they
could
have
done
so
for
virtually
no
cost
at
all,
no
additional
effort.
and
we
know
from
what
happened
with
the
eviction
notice
that
had
they
taken
that
very
minimal
effort
to
post
the
notice,
it
would
have
worked.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
justice
souter,
you
do.
that...
that
is
our...
our
point,
but
i
would
like
to
qualify
that
slightly.
in...
if
the
search
does
not,
with
reasonably
diligent
efforts,
turn
up
a
better
address
or
of
there's
a
better
address
and
the
letter
comes
back,
i
think
at
point
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
stop
searching
for
an
address,
to
give
up
on
mailed
notice,
and
at
that
point
post
the
property
because
getting--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--well,
if
they
contracted
with
a
credit
bureau,
for
example,
or
a
skip
tracer,
it
is
quite
easy
to
find
people
that
have
moved
across
the
country,
much
easier
today
than
it
was,
you
know,
years
ago
because
technology
has
really
expanded
the
amount
of
information
that
is
readily
ascertainable.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
justice
kennedy,
that
would
be
a
reasonable
way
to
have
a
statutory
scheme.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
it
might
be
prudent
to
do
that.
i
think
that
one--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--yes,
although
if
the
title
is
set
aside,
ms.
flowers
will
receive
a
full
refund
of
all
the
money
that
she's
paid,
and
that's
under
the
arkansas
statutory
scheme.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
that
may
be
correct
and
i
think
when
somebody
goes
to
purchase
property
and
they
find
out
that
title
insurance
is
not
available
because
of
the
tax
sale
deed,
they
have
to
consider
the
potential
exposure.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
i
think
only
for
a
temporary
period
of
time
because
there's
a
2-year
statute
of
limitations
to
challenge
the
sale
and
that's
why
the
state
tells
tax
sale
purchasers
that
they
should
not
make
expensive
improvements
to
property
until
that
time
has
closed.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record.
i'm
not
sure
whether--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--i
don't
know,
your
honor,
whether
a
title
search
would
reveal
it,
but
certainly
in
the
county
records,
all
of
the
delinquent
properties
are
entered
and
open
to
the
public
for
inspection.
they
may
have
to
look
in
two
different
places.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
justice
scalia,
i--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--no,
it
would
not
because--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--justice
scalia,
i
believe
the
federal
constitutional
obligation
would
still
apply
regardless
of
whether
the
state
of
arkansas
tried
to
legislate
its
way
out
of
it.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
well,
it--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--i
don't
think...
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that's...
if
arkansas
had
that
kind
of
statute,
that
it
would
make
this
case
come
out
differently
because
i
think
the
due
process
analysis
and
the
application
of
the
mullane
standard
to
these
facts
where
the
initial
mailed
notice
comes
back
would
be
the
same.
i
think
it
may
be
a
factor,
when
we're
determining
what
is
reasonable,
whether
or
not
the
owner
complied
with
that
statute,
but
i
don't
think
that
mr.
jones
loses
his
constitutional
right.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
criminal
law
they
could.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
he
lost
about
$70,000
worth
of
equity.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
that
would
seem
to
be
a
very
harsh
penalty.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
i
do.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
that's
right.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
justice
stevens,
it
should
not
figure
in
at
all
because
he
still
had
a
statutory
right
to
redeem
the
property,
and
once
he
had
that
statutory
right
to
redeem
the
property,
due
process--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--in
fact,
in
this
case
he
did
not.
and
while
the
record
is
rather
sparse
on
this,
the
mortgage
company
paid
the
taxes
for
30
years.
after
the
mortgage
was
retired,
mr.
jones
thought
that
the
occupant,
mrs.
jones,
was
paying
the
taxes.
he
was
mistaken
in
that
belief
and
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
typically
the
homeowner
certainly
should,
but
we
all
make
mistakes
and
certainly
there
are
lawyers--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--arkansas
set
up
a
statutory
scheme
that
gave
him
a
right
to
redeem
up
until
30
days
after
the
sale
of
the
property.
that
statutory
right...
he
gets
due
process
whether
he's
innocent
or
not
innocent.
and
i
think
in
the
case
where--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--they
wait
until
the
taxes
have
been
delinquent
for
1
year.
at
that
time,
it's
certified
from
the
county
to
the
state.
they
send
notice
saying
that
2
years
into
the
future,
there
will
be
a
tax
sale
if
the
property
hasn't
been
redeemed.
even
after
that
public
sale,
there's
a
30-day
redemption
period.
in
this
case
the
house
didn't
sell
at
the
public
sale.
so
then
we
started
an
entirely
new
process
of
the
negotiated
sale,
which
again
involved
notice
and
ultimately
the
property
was
sold
at
negotiated
sale.
so
there
is
sufficient
time
after
the
state
learns
about
the
failure
of
the
initial
mailed
notice
to
take
further
reasonable
steps.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the...
the
figure,
which
comes
from
the
tsann
kuen
case
out
of
arkansas
supreme
court,
is
that
there
are
18,000
tax
delinquent
parcels
certified
every
year
in
arkansas.
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
85
percent
of
tax
delinquent
properties
in
arkansas
are
redeemed
by
the
owner
either
before
the
tax
sale
or
within
30
days
after.
so
we
don't
know
how
many
notices
came
back
unclaimed
after
the
first
attempt.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
she
was.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
no.
they
were
separated.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
basically,
justice
breyer,
but
the...
the
letters--
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
--yes,
he
does
have
some
obligation
to
watch
what's
going
on.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
letters
did
not
actually
come
to
the
house.
there
were
three
delivery
attempts
for
each
letter,
but
the
letters
themselves...
nobody
was
at
home
during
the
day
when
the
letter
carrier
came
by.
so
the
letters
themselves
were
not
left.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
if
the
letter
carrier
followed
proper
procedure,
the
notice
would
have
been
left,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
one
way
or
the
other
whether
that
happened.
but
at
most,
that
notice
would
say
that
there
was
a
certified
letter
for
gary
jones
and
it
may
have
said
that
it
was
sent
by
the
commissioner
of
state
lands.
it
didn't
say
tax
delinquent
notice.
the
county
is
who
assesses
the
taxes.
many
lay
people
might
think
that
the
land
commissioner
of
arkansas
was
writing
about
the
parks
or
the
state
forests
or
any
number
of
things.
so
i
don't
think
we
can
charge
mrs.
jones
with
knowledge
that
there
was
a
tax
delinquent
notice
waiting
for
mr.
jones
just
because,
if
the
letter
carrier
did
what
he
or
she
should
have,
a
notice
of
delivery
slip
would
have
been
left
at
the
house.
but
remember
also
that
after
the
first
notice
came
back,
it
was
3
years
later
when
they
sent
the
notice
of
the
negotiated
sale,
and
that
was
after
they
knew
that
it
was
likely
a
futile
gesture
to
send
certified
mail
to
mr.
jones
at
that
address,
and
it
was
after
they
had
actually
gone
out
and
visited
the
house.
so
at
a
minimum,
they
should
have
posted
a
notice
at
the
property.
and
while
in
some
cases
like
greene
v.
lindsey
or
schroeder
v.
city
of
new
york,
posting
was
inadequate,
and
the
court
said
that
mail
would
have
been
better,
at
least
here,
knowing
that
mail
had
not
worked,
even
if
the
state
chose
not
to
search
for
a
better
address,
at
a
minimum
they
should
have
posted
a
notice
at
the
property
and
that
would
have
made
all
the
difference
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
it
absolutely
is
in
the
state's
interest
to
provide
the
best
notice
practicable
for
three
reasons.
first,
redemption
of
property
by
the
owner
is
the
most
efficient
and
cost
effective
means
for
the
state
to
collect
the
back
taxes.
second,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting
its
citizens
from
a
loss
of
assets
in
equity,
like
what
was
lost
by
mr.
jones
here.
and
third,
if
notice
is
received
because
of
follow
up
efforts
or
if
the
state
can
show
that
it
has
made
follow
up
efforts,
then
it
will
not
face
challenges
based
on
inadequate
notice.
in
terms
of
the
feasibility
of
doing
something
more,
the
question
was
raised
about
other
states.
certainly
many
states
do
more.
we've
listed
about
five
or
six
states
that
actually
have
a
statutory
scheme
that
deals
with
what
happens
when
initial
mailed
notice
comes
back.
and
in
footnote
9
and
footnote
10
of
the
reply
brief,
we
indicate
states
that
require
posting
and
states
that
require
notice
to
occupants.
justice
souter,
with
regard
to
your
question
about
the
cost
of
tracking
down
a
better
address
or
providing
notice,
those
costs
can
be
passed
on
to
the
redeemer
or
purchaser
of
the
property.
and
if
we
look
at
the
statute
dealing
with
notice
to
homestead
owners,
it
says
that
where
the
mail
does
not
work,
the
additional
cost
of
the
notice
by
personal
service
of
process
will
be
paid
by
the
owner
of
the
homestead
who
redeems.
so
certainly
they
could
pass
along
those
costs.
they
could
pass
along
the
costs
of
searching
for
a
better
address
just
like
we
do
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
context
when
we
charge
for
government
employee
time
to
search
for
records.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
that,
your
honor,
but
certainly
when
he
first
moved
out,
he
did
not
know
what
the
future
would
hold
in
terms
of
the
length
of
that
separation.
now,
it...
it
is
also
not
in
the
record,
but
he
did,
in
fact,
file
a
change
of
address
form,
a
forwarding
form,
but
it
had
long
expired
before
these
certified
letters
came.
that
was
actually
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
letter
carrier
not
to
say,
forwarding
order
expired.
and
while
a
forwarding
order
is
only
good
for
18
months,
there
is
the
national
change
of
address
database
which
reveals
those
things
for
a
period
of
4
years.
so
that's
something
else
the
state
could
have
checked.
also,
this
is
not
an
attack
on
dusenbery.
this
would
be
dusenbery
all
over
again
if
mrs.
jones
had
signed
for
the
letter
and
the
state
had
gotten
back
the
green
card
saying
that
letter
was
received
by
somebody
at
717
north
bryan
street.
then
it
would
be
dusenbery.
this
is
not
dusenbery
because
the
difference
is
in
dusenbery
they
knew
that
the
letter
was
actually
received
at
the
facility
where
mr.
dusenbery
was
incarcerated.
here,
the
state
actually
knew
that
the
letter
had
never
been
received.
with
regard
to
value
of
the
property,
that
$80,000
figure
is
not
picked
out
of
the
air.
it's
true,
as
mr.
phillips
said,
that
the
parties
stipulated
that
that
was
the
market
value
of
the
property,
but
in
fact,
by
statute...
and
that's
arkansas
code
annotated
section
26-26-303...
the
assessed
value
of
property
cannot
exceed
20
percent
of
the
market
value.
the
minimum
bid
was
the
assessed
value,
plus
the
interest,
plus
the
penalties,
plus
the
costs
of
notice.
ms.
flowers,
in
her
negotiated
purchase
offer,
made
the
minimum
bid
plus
$200.
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
letter
came
back
unclaimed,
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
it...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
michael
t.
kirkpatrick
that
it
was
not
marked
refused.
so
it
did
not
indicate
that
somebody
saw
the
letter
and
didn't
want
to
take
it.
