mr.
kirkpatrick,
i
don't
recall
what...
what
the
rule
is.
does
notice
have
to
be
given
by
registered
mail?
would
it...
would
it
be
adequate
notice
in
the...
in
the
ordinary
case
to
send
notice
by
regular
mail?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
do
we
have
a
case
that
says
that,
you
have
to
use
registered
mail?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
we
did.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
especially
when
you
have
the
taxpayer's
name
and
address
on
file,
i
doubt
whether
it
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process
to
send
notice
by
regular
mail
to
that
address.
and
if...
if
that
satisfies
due
process,
the
state
would
never
have
known
that
it
did
not
reach
the
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
seems...
it
seems
mean
to
punish
the
state
for
going
the
extra
mile
and
sending
the
notice
by
registered
mail
because
that
informed
them
that
it
didn't
reach
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
this
case
come
out
differently?
you
know,
if
your
client
had
an
obligation
to
keep
the
state
informed
of...
of
his...
his
address
so
that
they
could
send
the
tax
bills
to
him,
suppose
the
statute,
in
addition
to
simply
reciting
that
obligation,
said,
and
if
the
taxpayer
does
not
keep
the
state
advised
of
his
current
address,
any
notice
mailed
to
the
last
address
that
he
gave
will
suffice
for
all
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
said
that
explicitly.
would
that...
would
that
make
this
case
come
out
differently?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
mean,
the
state
can
punish
people
for
not
doing
what
the
law
tells
them
to
do,
and
here
the
state
is
saying
we
tell
you
to
keep
us...
you
keep
us
advised
of
your...
your
address.
if
you
don't,
i
guess
we
could
throw
you
in
jail
for
half
a
year,
but
we're
not
doing
to
do
that.
we're
just
going
to
say
that...
that
your...
your
punishment
for
violating
the
law
is
that
this
kind
of
a
notice
will
suffice.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
there...
no,
but
this
is
a
consequence
of
violating
the
law
of...
of
arkansas.
certainly
the
state
can
impose
consequences
for
violating
its
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
and
my
next
question
is
going
to
be,
if
you
way
it
would
come
out
differently,
then
isn't...
isn't
it
sort
of
silly
to
make
the
state
come
on
and
say
that?
if
they
could
do
the
same
thing
by
simply
reciting
what's
going
to
happen,
why...
why
should
we
make
them
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
they
fine
him
for
not...
could
they
fine
him
for
not...
for
not
keeping
them
advised
of...
of
where...
where
his
tax
address
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could.
right.
could
they
fine
him...
how
much
money
did
you
lose
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
they
fine
him
$70,000?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
pretty
harsh,
but
do
you
think
this
court
would
strike
it
down?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
even
sure
it
protects
that
minority.
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
won't
be
home
when
the...
when
the
postman
comes
with
the...
with
the
registered
letter,
but
there
are
very
few
who...
who
won't
take
the
trouble
to...
to
pick
it
up.
i
mean,
it
may
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
isn't
there
a
second
purpose
for...
for
sending
it
certified
mail?
and
that
is,
it
assures
that
it
doesn't
get
lost.
i
think
they
track
it
closer.
they
can
tell
you
where
the
letter
is.
i
think
each
post
office
has
to
record
that
they've
received
it
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
if
you
just
sent
it
regular
mail,
it
may
have
been
lost.
justice
antonin
scalia
this...
this
assures
that
it
reaches
the
destination.
justice
antonin
scalia
your...
your
friend
said
that
the
$80,000
comes
from
the
fact
that
it...
at
the...
at
the
auction,
it...
the
opening
bid
is
one
quarter
of
the
fair
market
value.
he
said
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
well,
was
the
opening
bid
$20,000?
so
it
was
at
least
one
quarter
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
see.
