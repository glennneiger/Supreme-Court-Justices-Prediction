justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
did
they
find
him,
by
the
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
did
they
find
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
not
saying
how
did
they?
how
in
your
opinion
should
the
post
office
department
or
the
government
have
found
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
find
13
people
called
gary
jones
or
g.
jones
in
little
rock.
now,
what
do
they
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
his
wife
is
living
in
the
house?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
were
they
divorced?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
he
owns
the
house.
she
doesn't.
she
must
not
pay
any
taxes,
and
she
sees
these
letters
coming
from
him
registered
and
says,
oh,
they're
his
problem.
that's
basically
what
could
have
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
have
that
kind
of
relationship
with
your
wife,
doesn't
he
have
an
obligation
to
watch
what's
going
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
they
leave
a
notice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
this
day...
in
today's
world,
a
registered
letter
is
worse
than
ordinary
mail.
that
is,
i
don't
think...
my
understanding
is
that
the
post
office,
unlike
fedex
and
unlike
ups,
if
you're
not
home,
they
leave
a...
a
notice,
you
know,
and
you
check
a
box,
and
if
you
check
the
box,
they'll
leave
it
off
the
next
day.
we
don't
live
in
a...
my
wife
isn't
home.
my
wife
works.
and...
and
most
wives
no
longer
stay
home
to
get
the
mail,
and
we
don't
all
have
butlers
at
the
door.
and
you
call
up
the
post
office.
they
say,
oh...
if
you
get
through
to
a
human
being,
which
takes
15
minutes,
after
you
go
through
the
menu,
they
say,
phone
the
post
office
branch.
and
they
say
go
get
in
the
car,
find
a
parking
place,
get
in
the
line,
and
there's
half
a
morning
gone.
now,
why
is
that
a
reasonable
way?
why
can't
they
do
what
fedex
does?
this
is
a
world...
husband
works,
wife
works,
two
children
are
screaming.
we've
got
to
get
them
to
the
doctor.
we
have
to
have
them
at
school.
they
have
appointments
all
morning,
and
there's
nobody
home.
so
whatever
they
did
with
mullane
and
said
registered
mail
is
fine,
why
isn't
it
unreasonable
to
use
that
system
rather
than
use
fedex's
system?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
not?
it
says
calculated.
it
may
be.
now,
you
tell
me
why
it's
so
remarkable
because
i
think
i
could
take
judicial
notice
of
what
life
is
like
for
most
families
in
the
world
today,
that
they
don't
have
butlers,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait.
let...
let
them
do
that.
fine.
just
have
a
little
box
and
the
person
signs
and
says,
tomorrow
leave
it
at
the
house,
just
like
fedex
does.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see
what
you
think
of
this.
if
in
fact
the
letter--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
we
skip
that.
what
about...
you
know,
i
was
thinking
precisely
the
same,
but
just
with
slightly...
if
you
get
the
letter
back
and
you
don't
have
the
fedex
rule,
you
either
have
to
have
the
fedex
rule
or
send
a
letter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
because
the
purpose
is
to
get
reasonably
calculated
to
get
notice,
and
in
the
world
today,
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
houses
where
nobody
is
home,
you
know,
and
there's
no
convenient
way
for
them
to
go
to
the
post
office
without
giving
up
a
certain
amount
of
work.
and
so
they
say,
forget
it.
if
it
comes
from
the
lands
division
or
something,
who
cares?
now,
that...
i
don't
know
how
you'd
know
how
many
there
are
like
that,
but
it's
a
question
of
reasonable
calculation
now
to
get
the
mail
through.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
a
tiny
minority--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
redeliver...
you
have
to
be
there
to
sign
for
it
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
then...
then
the
problem--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
thinking...
what
i'm
thinking
is
that
where...
where
you're
trying
to
reach
a
person,
the
means
has
to
be
reasonably
calculated.
i'm
simply
saying
a
means
today
is
not
reasonably
calculated
to
reach
the
average
person
unless
it
gives
him
the
choice
of
getting
it
when
he's
not
home.
all
right?
now,
there
are
two
ways
that
could
happen.
one,
you
could
modify
that
form
or,
second,
the
simple
rule
would
be
if
it
comes
back
undelivered,
mail
them
a
letter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say
all
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
said
do
either.
what
i...
what
i
was
thinking
of,
which
isn't
clearly
i
think
coming
across,
is
send
it
certified
mail,
by
all
means.
fine.
he
either
has
to
sign
and
say,
leave
it
off
tomorrow,
i'm
not
home,
or
if
the
post
office
doesn't
make
that
available,
then
if
the
letter
comes
back
undelivered,
the
person
who's
trying
to
send
him
notice
has
to
send
him
an
ordinary
letter.
