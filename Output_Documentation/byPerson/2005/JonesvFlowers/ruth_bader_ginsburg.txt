why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
mullane,
it
was
regular
mail.
it
wasn't
certified
mail.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
isn't
it
100
percent
clear
that
there
were
a
number
of
those
addressees
who
didn't
get
the
letter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet,
their
answers
were
cut
out
by
the
decision,
and
the
court
said
that
was
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
another
factor
here
that
wasn't
present
in
mullane;
that
is,
the
person
who
received
notice
has
a
statutory
obligation
to
advise
government
of
the
current
address.
the
people
involved
in
mullane
had
no
such
obligation
to
notify
anybody
of
their
current
address.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn't
the
government
in...
in
mullane
it
wasn't
the
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
also
had
a
continuing
obligation
to
inform
the
government
of
his
address.
one
fact
about
this
case
that...
perhaps
it
was
in
the
record
and
i
missed
it.
at
the
time
the
property
was
sold,
how
much
did
mr.
jones
owe,
taking
account
of
the
back
taxes,
the
interest,
the
penalties,
all
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
people--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kirkpatrick,
you
distinguish
mullane.
you
recognize
that
a
lot
of
the
people
never
got
that
notice,
and
you
said
there
were
many
people
involved
there,
that
you
could
rely
on
others.
it's
also
how
much
of
a
burden
are
you
going
to
put
on
the
notice
giver
when
you
have
a
large
class
involved.
there
was
a
figure...
and
i
forgot
what
the
number
was...
of
how
many
notices
are...
don't
succeed
in
delivery.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
including...
including
arkansas.
didn't
arkansas
change
its
law
so
now
it
requires
if
you...
if
it's
unclaimed,
they
have
to
do
personal
service?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
taxpayer,
though--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
taxpayer...
even
though
he
failed
to
give
notice
of
his
current
address,
this
taxpayer
would
be
entitled
under
the
current
statute
to
personal
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
he
still
lived
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
he
still
lived
in
arkansas.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
homestead.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
see.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose...
suppose
we
had
a
case
where
the
homeowner
has
kept
the
lands
commissioner
informed
of
her
current
address,
does
everything
she
was
supposed
to
do
except
at
the
time
this
notice,
certified
mail
notice...
at
the
time
of
the
delivery
attempt,
she's
hospitalized
having
a
quadruple
bypass,
so
she
never
gets
it.
and
then
what...
what
are
the
consequences
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mullane,
as
mr.
kirkpatrick
pointed
out,
involved
masses
of
people.
this
was
a
common
trust
fund,
and
the
reliance
was
on
that
a
goodly
number
of
them
would
get
notice
and
they
were
kind
of
stand
ins
for
the
ones
who
didn't.
but
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
single
individual.
