mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
notice
that
was
provided
in
this
case
satisfies
the
mullane
reasonably
calculated
test.
first,
the
state
sent
it
by
certified
mail.
certified
mail...
actually
in
response
to
a
question
that
came
up
earlier,
the
form...
when
certified
mail
is...
is
delivered
and
the
recipient
is
not
there,
they
leave
a
form
3849.
that
form
isn't
in
the
record,
but
i
think
it's
probably
available
from
any
post
office.
on
the
reverse
side,
it
says,
we
will
redeliver
or
your
agent
can
pick
up
your
mail
at
the
post
office,
and
it
has
a
place
for
the
person
to
check
off
a
box
saying
to
redeliver
and
leaves
instructions
to
leave
this
where
the
postman
can
find
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
but
they--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--they
do
need
a
signature.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
court...
i
believe
that
certified
mail
is...
is
a
more
reliable
method
than
first
class
mail
because
it
requires
the
mail
person,
the
carrier,
to
get
to...
get
a
signature
at...
at...
he
has
to
go
from
a
particular
person.
he
can't
deliver
it
to
the
wrong
place.
also,
the
post
office
itself
has
means
whereby
the
carrier
has
to
keep
track
of
how
many
receipts
he's
supposed
to
have,
whether
he's
brought
them
back
and
so
on.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
that
rule,
it
would
give
states
an
enormous
incentive
and
people
giving
notice
to
just
send
things
by
first
class
mail
in
the
first
instance,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
and
has...
has
said
is...
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
due
process,
including
in
cases
involving
tax
sales
in
the
mennonite
case,
condemnation
of
property
in
the...
in
the
city
of
new
york
case,
and
similar
kinds
of
events.
certified...
what
the
state
did
here,
though,
it
has
always...
it
has
generally
been
thought
that
certified
mail
is
a
more
reliable
means
of
giving
people
notice,
and
that's
what
the
state
used
here.
and
i
don't...
i
don't
take
petitioner
to
be
arguing
that
they
made
a
mistake
because
they
used
certified
mail
rather
than
first
class
mail.
having
said
that,
the
state
also
sent
the
mail
to
the
only
address,
probably
the
only
address
anywhere
in
the
public
record.
what
it
needed
was
something
that
tied
this
person
to
this
address,
not
to
somebody
named
gary
jones
somewhere
in
the
state
or
the
world.
and
probably
the
only
thing
in
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
say
they...
they
do
slightly
more.
what
the
irs
does
do
is
there
is
a
requirement
and
congress
can
provide
and
other
states
can
provide
that
more
resources
should
be
spent
in
something
like
this
than
the
minimum
due
process
floor.
but
what
they've
provided
is
that
where
the
property
owner
is
in
the
irs
district,
then...
then
personal
service
is
what
they
first
attempt.
where
the...
where
the
property
owner
is
not
in
the
internal
revenue
district,
then
they
do
exactly
what
the
state
did,
which
is
they
send
it
by
certified
mail.
and
they
check
the...
i
think
they
check
a
postal
database
of
change
of
address
forms.
but
we
know
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
change
of
address
form
because
when
the
letter
came
back,
it
didn't
come
back
saying,
moved,
here's
the
new
address
or...
or
change
of
address
form
expired.
in
any
event,
this
was
probably
the
only
thing
in
the
public
record
that
tied
this
taxpayer
to
this
property,
and
that's
what
the
state
used.
and
then
it
further
used
publication
and
sent
another
notice.
there
was
a
total
of
six
different
times
when
the
mail
carrier
attempted
to...
to
deliver
it
and,
if
he
followed
the
postal
regulations...
there's
no
reason
to
think
he
didn't...
left
a
notice
on
the
door.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
right,
but
the
state
under
the
dusenbery
case
is
not
obligated
to
provide
actual
notice.
the
state
is
obligated
to
provide
notice
reasonably
calculated
to
let
the
person
know
what's
going
on,
and
if
the
person
is
not
responding
to
a
notice
from
the
commissioner
of
state
lands
and
going
to
the
post
office
to
pick
it
up
or
asking
for
it
to
be
redelivered,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
suggested
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
notice
is...
is
inappropriate
because
the...
the
landowner
hasn't
taken
the
steps
that
he
should
have
taken
to...
to,
in
fact,
i
think
a...
a
large
part
of
what
petitioner's
argument
here
is,
is
really
at
bottom
an
attack
on
dusenbery.
dusenbery
said...
the
court
held
actual
notice
is
not
required.
what's
required
is
just
notice
reasonably
calculated
to
reach
someone.
but
under
petitioner's
rule
here,
the
state,
as
soon
as
it
finds
out
some
doubt...
and
that's
all
it
had
here...
some
doubt
about
whether
it
had
the
right
address
because
it
may
well
have
had
the
correct
address
and
he
didn't
go
to
the
post
office
to
pick
it
up.
as
soon
as
it
had
some
doubt
about
whether
it
had
the
right
address,
it
has
to
take
unspecified
further
steps
to
send
it
out
again
to
another
address,
and
if
that
doesn't
work,
presumably
another
address
and
another
address.
and
each...
whatever
method,
whether
it's
a
directory
or
the
internet
or
whatever
method
it
uses,
it's...
it's
going
to
create
a
litigable
issue
about
whether
did
it
do
the
right
thing,
did
it
use
the
right
internet
service,
did
it
use
the
right
telephone
directory,
did
it
go
in
a
wide
enough
area,
should
it
have
done
the
whole
country.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
our
position
is
that
the
standard
is
if
it
was
reasonably
calculated
to
provide
notice
at
the
time
it
was
sent,
which
in
this
case
it
was...
they
used
the
only
address
in
the
public
record
that
ties
him
to
this
property,
and
their
belief
that
they
had
the
right
address
was
supported
by
the
state
law
that
said
he
has
to
provide
them
with
a
change
of
address.
but
under
those
circumstances,
they've
done
enough,
and
if
it
comes
back
and
just
says,
well,
he
didn't
pick
it
up
at
the
post
office,
then
that's...
then
they've
satisfied
the
rudimentary--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
don't
think
that
that's
necessarily
true.
and...
and
mullane
also
said
that
what
the...
whoever
it
was
who
had
to
provide
the
notice
in
that
case
had
to
do
was
provide
notice
to
the
addresses.
the
addresses
were
at
hand
was
the
phrase
that
it
used.
and
in
other
cases,
the
court
has
talked
about
the
line
between
publication
notice,
on
the
one
hand,
and
notice
by
mail.
that
line
is
a
line
of
addresses
that
are
very
easily
ascertainable.
if
they're
very
easily
ascertainable,
you
have
to
send
the
mail.
if
not,
then
that's
what
publication
notice
is
for.
and
it
seems
to
me
in
this
case,
when
the
notice
came
back
unclaimed,
then
the
state
was
entitled
to
assume
that
either
it
had
provided
notice
and
he
just
didn't
want
to
pick
it
up
or,
at
worst,
that
his
address
was
no
longer
very
easily
ascertainable,
and
at
that
point
his
obligation
was
only
to
publish
notice,
which
it
did.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
agree
it
does
no
good
at
all.
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
ordinarily
do
it.
[laughter]
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
can't
recall.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--what
i
was
going
to
say
is
i
think
that
every
year,
i'm
confident
that
there's
home...
there's
people
throughout
the
country
probably
who
are
notified
of...
of
tax
sales
and
things
like
that
because
someone
sees
it,
someone
lets
them
know.
they're
keeping
an
eye
on
that
to
see
what's
happening
to
their
property.
he
had
left
his
property
without
leaving
a
change
of
address
form
with
the
state,
and
it...
it
is
possible.
now,
notice
by
publication
is
not
preferred,
but
what...
the
line
that's
drawn
in
mullane
and
the
court's
other
cases
are
where
the
address
is
very
easily
ascertainable
or
readily
available
or
at
hand
versus
where
it's
not.
and
unless
the
court
is
going
to
say,
well,
that
line
has
to
be...
it's
going
to
overrule
cases
that...
that
have
actually
drawn
that
line,
such
as
mullane
itself
that
permitted
publication
notice
to
some
people,
then
i
think
the
result
follows
here
that
when
the
notice
came
back
unclaimed,
that
was...
the
state
was
permitted
to
go
ahead
with
the
sale.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
that's
true,
but
the
court
has
also
permitted
notice
by
publication
where
other...
i
mean,
it
has
always
drawn
the
line
of
notice
of
publication
versus
notice
by
mail
at
where
the
address
is
very
easily
ascertainable.
but
i
would
say
that
what...
the
government's
interest,
the
most
important
interest
here,
is
in
knowing
what
it's
supposed
to
do.
if
you...
if
there's
an
open
ended
standard
that
says,
well,
it
just
has
to
keep
doing
something,
then
either
it's...
well,
then
the
result
of
that
predictably
is
going
to
be
the
government
is
going
to
never
be
able
to
be
satisfied
unless
it
gives
in
hand
notice
or--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--may
i
respond
to
that?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
just
have
two
quick
things.
one
is
in
the
greene
against
lindsey
case
and...
i
can't
remember
the
name
of
the
other
case.
in
the
greene
against
lindsey
case,
the
court
said
that...
that
kind
of
notice
has
its
own
problems.
the
irs
and
state
authorities
have
had
problems
with
posting
notice
in
cases
where
the
owners
are
not
often
happy
to
see
agents
from
the
government
who
are
trying
to
collect
taxes.
that
can
actually
be
rather
expensive.
and
the
arkansas
supreme
court
itself
said
that
the
state
itself
frequently
doesn't
have
the
address
for
the
property.
it
has
only
the
legal
description
and
it
would
be
a
significant
burden
to
find
it.
