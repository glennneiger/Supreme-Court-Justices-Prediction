justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
interrupt
with
this
question?
do
you
think
all
those
steps
were
constitutionally
mandated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
constitutionally
mandated
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
not
include
posting
on
the...
posting
a
notice
on
the
house
as
constitutionally
mandated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
they
can...
they
can
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
lot
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
trying
to
decide
what
they
must
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
constitutionally
sufficient
if
they
posted
a
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
now
so
it
would
not
be
constitutionally
sufficient
if
that's
all
they
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
is
the
constitutional
minimum
that
would
be
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
decided
on
a
case
by
case
basis
depending
on
the
particular
facts
in
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
opponent
argues
very
persuasively
the
mechanical
rules
are
very
important
in
this
particular
area
of
government
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
kirkpatrick?
in
arkansas,
is
the
tax...
tax
delinquency
a
matter
of
public
record
so
a
prospective
purchaser
would
find
it
by
making
a
title
search?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
could
be
revealed
by
a
title
search?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
frankly
don't
see
the
difference
between
failing
to
keep
the
state
advised
as
to
your
residence
and
failing
to
pay
your
taxes.
he
knew
he
had
a
duty
to
pay
the
taxes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
should
not
that
figure
into
the
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
i
understand
that.
but
doesn't...
he
would
know
whether
the
taxes
had
been
paid
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
this
is
a
very
unique
fact
situation.
we're
trying
to
announce
a
rule
that
will
govern
the
typical
transaction.
and
is
it
not
true
that
typically
the
homeowner
will
know
whether
or
not
he's
paid
his
taxes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
has
to
make
mistakes
for
2
or
3
years
running
before
it's
significant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
how
long
do
the
taxes
have
to
be
in
arrears
before
they
can
send
him
a
notice
and
start
the
proceeding
running?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
the
chief
justice
not
correct
that
ordinary
mail
is
more
apt
to
get
to
the
destination
than
certified
mail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
it's
marginal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the...
the
principal
purpose
of
the
certified
mail
is
to
let
the
sender
know
whether
or
not
the
notice
was
received.
it
would
seem
that
a
state
that
decides
to...
to
make
it
necessary
in
every
case
to
find
that
answer
should
have
some...
some
purpose
in
doing
so
and...
and,
therefore,
some
follow
up
that
would
occur
when
it's
not
delivered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
also
know
that
nobody
got
the
notice.
if
nobody
signed
for
it
and
took
it,
nobody
read
the
letter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
would
know
that
the
letter
was
not
opened
and
read
by
the
addressee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it
isn't
opened
and
read--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
it
isn't
opened
and
read,
they
didn't
get
notice.
they
didn't
get
actual
notice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
i
intended
to
ask
your
opponent?
how
many
states
have
rules
that
require
something
more?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
you
think
of
a
rule
that
said--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
would
you
think
of
a
rule
that
said
if
you
use
certified
mail
and
it
returns
uncollected,
the
additional
step
you
must
take,
you
just
send
ordinary
mail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
that
even
you
might
not
have
an
obligation,
it
seemed
to
me
you
would
have
a
motivation
to
do
more
because
you
want
to
collect
your
taxes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
sort
of
puzzling
to
me
as
why
the
states
don't
have
a...
an
affirmative
interest
in
providing
the
best
notice
that
they
can.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
$20,000
would
have
been
a
permissible
bid
even
if
the
market
value
was
$40,000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
unrealistic
to
assume
that
the
average
citizen
would
know
that
duty
more
clearly
than
he'd
know
the
duty
to
pay
his
taxes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
a
lot
of
people
who
buy
property
at
tax
sales
do
read
those
notices
regularly.
