mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
it's
somewhat
startling
to
me
that
in
a
case
involving
a
fundamental
question
of
what
notice
is
due
under
the
due
process
clause,
that
the
phrase,
reasonably
calculated
to
provide
notice
to
the
affected
property
owner,
was
never
used
in
the
petitioner's
submission
because
at
least,
as
i
remember
mullane
i
suppose
from
my
law
school
days
and...
and
since
then,
that
is
the
fundamental
test.
the
question
is
has
the
state
undertaken
to...
to
make
a
reasonable
calculation
to,
in
fact,
provide
notice
under
these
circumstances.
it's
sort
of
startling
to
me
in
the...
in
the
face
of
a
decision
like
this
court
wrote
in
mennonite
board,
where
it
says
explicitly,
you
know,
the
minor
inconvenience
and
administrative
burden
of
using
the
regular
mails
is
a
complete
answer
to
claims
that
something
less
than
that
should
be
provided.
and
again,
petitioner's
counsel
first
answer
to
the
question,
would
ordinary
mail
have
been
sufficient
under
these
circumstances,
is
no.
for
property
like
this,
that's
not
sufficient.
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
the
dusenbery
case
answers
that
because
while
it
was
true
that
the
mails
that
were
sent
originally
to
the
prison
itself
were
certified,
there's
no
certification
process
to
get
the
mails--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean,
that's
a
pretty
remarkable
due
process
constitutional--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
may...
i
may
let
mr.
feldman
defend
the...
the
postal
service
because
he
is
the
solicitor
general's
lawyer.
[laughter]
but
the
reality
is
that
for
the
vast
majority
of
the
mails,
the
mails
do
get
through.
and...
and
it
is
a
reasonable
calculation
that
if
you
mail
something
to
someone--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
it
will
get
there
and
it
will
be
properly
delivered.
that's
the...
the
purpose
of
the
certification.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the...
the
purpose
of
using
certified
mail
is
to
make
sure
that
it
actually
got
to
the
person--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
now
it
works
both
ways,
though,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
if...
if
it
goes
to
my
neighbor...
let's
assume
numbers
are
transposed...
it
goes
to
my
neighbor
and
the
neighbor
is
there
and
sees
the
information,
they'll
say
that
the...
that
that's...
that
goes
to
across
the
street.
and
then
you
take
it
across
the
street
and
you
get
it
signed.
that's
because
you
talked
to
a
specific
individual.
so
it
is,
in
fact,
designed
to
enhance
the
likelihood
that
it
will
actually
get
there.
but
i
don't
think
the
issue
here
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
as
a
matter
of
policy,
i
wouldn't
necessarily
disagree
with
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
and
as
i
say,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
justice
breyer,
i
wouldn't
necessarily
disagree
with
it.
but
as
a
matter
of
what
the
constitution
strait
jackets
states
to
provide,
it
strikes
me
as
a...
as
a
pretty
extraordinary
rule.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
it
is,
it's
probably
only
at
a...
at
a
marginal
number.
my
guess
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
percentages
are
very
small.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
except
for
this
problem...
i
mean,
the
other
problem
you
have
is
that
we
don't...
all
we
know
is
that
it
wasn't...
it...
it
came
back
unclaimed.
so
we
don't
even
know
that
it
didn't
get
delivered.
all
we
know
is
that
no
one
was
prepared
to
sign
for
it
and
accept
it.
we
don't
know,
as
justice
breyer's
hypothetical--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
you
could
look
at
the...
you
could
look
at
the
outside
and
say,
i'm
not
going
to
sign
for
this,
and
it's
unclaimed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
to
be
sure,
i
know
that
it
wasn't
opened
and
read,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
what
we
don't...
we
don't
even
know--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
justice
breyer
is
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
didn't
receive
actual
notice.
and,
of
course,
this
court
has
routinely
said
that
there's
no
constitutional
requirement
that
they
receive
actual
notice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i...
i
think
in
their
reply
brief
at
least,
they
make
an
effort,
and
we
didn't
go
and...
and
do
a
50-state
survey
between
a
week
ago
and
now
to
find
out.
but,
you
know,
a
fair
number
of
states
do.
i...
i
would
say
15,
20.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
it's
their
homestead,
not...
not
for
every
property
that
is...
for
which
taxes
are
not
paid,
but
for--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--for
property...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
that
is
true
because
this
is
not
this
taxpayer's
homestead.
he
no
longer
lives
at
this
address.
he,
as
his...
as
his
argument,
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
explaining--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--he
lives
elsewhere.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
he
lives
in
arkansas,
but
that
doesn't
make
this
his
homestead.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so
he
wouldn't...
he
wouldn't
qualify
for
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--for
the
additional
law.
but
again...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
just
demonstrates
the
wisdom
of
justice
brandeis'
reference
to
the
small
laboratories
because
what
we...
what
we
have
here
are
a
raft
of
different
approaches
that
the
states
take
to
give
either
more
or
less
notice
so
long
as
you
satisfy
the
constitutional
minimum.
the
problem--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
in
part
because
we...
we're
putting
out
a
notice
to
the
public
that
we're
selling
the
property.
so
it
serves
two
purposes.
it
notifies
that
there's
a
sale
to
take
place.
it
also
identifies
the
landowner,
giving...
or
the
property
owner
one
more
opportunity--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--on
its
own,
it
clearly
wouldn't
suffice.
the
court
has
decided
that
a
long
time...
i
mean,
that
is
mullane.
but
i
think
as
an...
as
an
additional
component,
if
you...
if
you
really
want
to
get
into
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
rather
than
what
i
think
is
the
better
rule,
which
is
to
say,
as
you
evaluate
what
we
did,
was
it
reasonably
calculated
to
provide
notice,
and
conclude,
yes,
it
was
reasonably
calculated
to
provide
notice
under
this
court's
rulings
that
mailing
is
an
appropriate
way
to
proceed,
i
think
we
would
win
there.
if
you
go
beyond
that
and
say,
well,
no,
you
have
to
do
something
plus,
if
you
go
down
the
reasonably
diligent
efforts
kind
of
an
approach,
i
would
say
then
don't
go
any
further
than
say
that
you're
required
to
publish
the
fact
of
the
sale
itself
because
to
go
beyond
that
is...
is
to
open
this.
and...
and
we've
already
seen
this--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
say
the...
the
additional
step
you
must
take
is
to
send
ordinary
mail,
we
could
probably
live
with
that
kind
of
a
rule.
the
problem
is,
one,
that's
not
the
standard
that's
been
proposed
here.
their
standard
is
going
to
be
and
if
it
turns
out
that
you
find
out
after
that
that
that
didn't
get
delivered,
then
you
have
to
go
through
this
litany.
you
have
to...
you
have
to
engage
in
posting.
you
have
to
contact
the
occupant
and
contact
the
relatives,
contact
their
employers,
retain
a
skip
tracing
service,
use
the
telephone
directory,
run
a
credit
check,
although
we
don't
have
social
security
numbers,
do
an
internet
search.
and
each
time
when
it
comes
back
that
there's
some
indication
that
you
didn't...
that
they
didn't
receive
notice,
which
they'll
always
say
is
because...
otherwise
for...
for
a
property
that
is
valuable,
if
i
had
received
notice,
i
would
have
shown
up.
you
have
an
ongoing,
continuing
obligation
to
find--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
sounds
like
you're
legislating,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
breyer,
you're
adopting
a
rule
that's
designed
to
protect
a
very,
very
tiny
minority
and
to
impose
a
burden,
a
significant
burden,
on
the
state.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and...
and
the
flip
side
of
that
is
there's
nothing
that
indicates
why
even...
even
the
person...
if
somebody
is
unwilling
to
go...
to
take
the
time
to
find
out
what
the
commissioner
of
lands
in
the
state
has
sent
a
certified
letter
for,
why
is
it...
why
would
you
assume
that
whenever
the
letter
comes
in
when
it's
addressed
to
mr.
jones,
that
mrs.
jones
isn't
going
to
toss
it
aside
just
as
quickly?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there's
no...
there's
nothing
that
indicates
one
way
or
the
other
what...
what
is
a
preferable
system
to
operate.
and
that's
why
i
think
this
is
intensely
a
legislative--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--they
do.
that...
that's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
that...
that's
always--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean,
i
don't
want...
i
don't
want
to
fight
the
hypothetical,
but
you
have
to
put
a
little
in
context
in
a
case
like
this
because
the
process
here
is
one
that's
fairly
protracted.
you
get
the
first
notice
and
then
there's
not...
there's
no
actual
sale
for
2
years.
and
in
this
case,
the
sale
didn't
take
place,
so
there
was...
you
know,
the
auction
didn't
lead
to
anything,
and
then
there
was
another...
another
sale.
so
we're
talking
about
essentially
a
3-year
period
of
time
when
the
person
has
to
be
incapacitated,
during
which
presumably...
and
there
have
been
multiple,
six
different
efforts
to
try
to
send
notice
to
her.
so
it's,
you
know,
one,
not
a
particularly
likely
hypothetical.
i
realize
i
shouldn't
fight
it.
but
two,
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
answer
is
you
can't
put
the
burden
on
the
state
to
understand
the...
the
precise
situation
of
each
of
the
individual
homeowners,
that
they
have
some
duties
because
they
know,
one,
they
do
owe
taxes;
two,
in
arkansas
they
should
know
that
they
owe
us
a
duty
to
keep
us
up
to
date
with
respect
to
their
situation,
and
where...
and
where
it
is
that
we
can
reach
them.
and
so
it's
reasonable
to
impose
those
duties--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases...
i'm
sorry...
due
process
will
be
satisfied
because
notice
will,
in
fact,
be
received.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
because...
because
the
difficulty
is
once
you
go
past
that,
what...
what
obligation
you
have
becomes
completely
unknowable
at
that
stage.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
and
that's...
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
stevens,
the
truth
is
most
of
them...
we
do.
and...
and
this
is
not
a...
and...
and
look
at
the
way
the
system
operates
here.
it's
not
like
we...
we
sent
out
this
notice,
got
back,
and
raced
off
to
sell
the
property
with
a
gotcha
in
hand.
i
mean,
we...
we
went
through
a
very
protracted
process
each
time
trying
to
get
this
person
to...
to
show
up.
i
mean,
put
this
into
a
certain
amount
of
context.
and
again,
you
have
to
deal
with
the
generality
of
cases
rather
than
this
one,
but
i
mean,
this
is
a
property
that's
got
a
tax
lien
on
it
already
for
unpaid
income
taxes
of...
of
approximately,
i
think,
about
$14,000,
and
then
it
has
unpaid
property
taxes,
you
know,
up
to
the...
up
to
the
total
amount
of
$200.
and
you
know,
under
those
circumstances,
we
let
it
sit
there
for
years.
i
mean,
there's
no
question
we
would
be
better
served
if...
if
they
would
have
shown
up
and
just
paid
off
the
taxes.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
goes
into
the
calculation
of
what's
the
right
answer
as
a
legislative
matter,
and
legislatures
have
made
pretty
reasonable
adjustments
in
terms
of,
you
know,
how
strong
is...
i
mean,
i
think
what
arkansas
did
here.
if
this
is
your
homestead,
we're
going
to
go
just
as
far
as
you
said,
justice
stevens,
to
try
to
make
sure
we
get
the
information
to
you.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
it's
not,
then
we're
not...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
i
think
absolutely
because
it's
significantly
undermines
the
state's
overall
effort
in
trying
to
get
its
money
back
because
it's
all
well
and
good
to
say
we
can
sell
the
property,
but
if
nobody
is
going
to
pay
for
the
property
anything
that
comes
close
to
the
value
of
even
getting
our
liens
paid
off,
then
we're
not
going
to
get
the
revenue
stream
that
we
would
otherwise
be
entitled
to.
and
even
if
you,
you
know,
go
through
the...
through
the
kind
of
machinations
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
assumes
that
there's
a...
that
there's
a
purchaser
that
wants
to
undertake
the
burden
and...
and
to
assume
that
risk.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
we
couldn't
sell
this
the
first
time
out.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
worth
taking
at
least
2
seconds
to
focus
on
the
market
value
argument
here,
this
$80,000
number.
that
was
a
number
that
arises
in
connection
with
the
supersedeas
bond,
and
it's
only
a
number
that
came
forward
by
the
private
loan...
property
purchaser,
not
the
state.
and
the
reason
was,
was
because
they
said,
if
you
don't
put
up
an
$80,000
bond,
we
want
to
take
over
the
property
immediately.
and
so
they
had
every
incentive
to
say
a
number
that
was
significantly
higher
than
what
the
value
of
this
property
is.
the
best
evidence
of
what
the
value
of
this
property
is
is
around
the
$20,000
that
a
real
purchaser
put
on
the
table
in
order
to
purchase
it.
the
point
here--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'd
be
willing
to
stipulate
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
truth
is
nobody
showed
up
even
for
an
auction
on
this
property.
so
we
don't
have
much
in
the
way
of
evidence
as
to
the
value
of
it.
and
all
i'm
saying
is
the
suggestion
of...
of
$80,000
as
the
relevant
number
here
is
a
number
that's
picked
out
of
the
air
for
a
purpose
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
fair
market
value.
it
has
to
do
with
the
value
of
a...
of
a
bond
that
would
have
to
be
issued
in
order
to
stop
the
transfer
of
possession
of
the
property
in
the
ejectment
action.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
has
to
be...
i
think
it
has
to
be
a
minimum
that,
but
you
know,
it
could
be
100
percent
of
the
fair
market
value.
mr.
carter

right,
but
it
could
also
be
100
percent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so
you
don't
know.
and...
and
in
his
brief,
his
argument
was
that
we...
that
there
was
a
stipulation
to
the
$80,000.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
that...
that's
the
only
point
i
was
trying
to
make
on
that
score.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
i
would
still
make
the
same
argument.
i
just
think
the
argument
has
extraordinary
force
when
the...
when
the
petitioner
has
an
obligation
to
provide
us
with
notice
because,
again,
it
goes...
you
know,
why
is
this
reasonably
calculated?
it's...
it's
in
the
context
of
a
scheme
that
says
you
will
provide
us
specific
information
and
we
will
rely
upon
that
as
the
mechanism
by
which
we
inform
you
of
your
obligations
to
us
and
that
under
those
circumstances
and
only
those
circumstances,
do
you
forfeit
your
property
rights.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the...
the
only
reason
he
would
know
that
duty
is
because
every...
every
property
tax
form
has
on
it
a
change
of
address
at
the
very
bottom
of
it
that's
perforated.
so
every
time
you
get
a
tax
form,
you
get
a
thing
that
says
change
your...
let
me
know
if
you've
changed
your
address.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the...
the
statute
talks
about
costs,
but
the
state
has
never
interpreted
that
term
to
mean
just
sort
of
the
out
of
pocket...
those
kinds
of
inchoate
costs,
and
they
usually
talk
about
very
specific
costs
like
the
cost
of
noticing
publication
and
other...
you
know,
other
items
that
you
can...
you
know,
where
you
have
a
receipt.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
practice
the
answer
is
no.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
your
honors,
i
urge
the
court
to
affirm.
