justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does...
does
it
follow
from
your
argument
that
someone
who
purchases
at
a
tax
sale,
before
they
conclude
the
purchase,
should
find
out
what
the
state
has
done?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
purchaser
from
that
purchaser
the
same.
in
other
words,
if
flowers
had
sold
to
x,
then
x
has
to
make
the
same
inquiry
because
he
sees
i
guess
what,
a
quit
claim
deed
or
a
tax
sale.
so
before
a
purchaser
can
purchase
from
flowers,
that
purchaser
too
must
see
whether
or
not
they
hired
an
outside
agency
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
it
required
to
do
that
under
your
title,
if
you're
going
to
have
your
title
set
aside
by
jones?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
purchaser
from
jones?
if...
pardon
me...
from
flowers.
if
flowers
has
spent
the
money,
then
that
purchaser
is
out
of
luck.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
one
of
the
consequences
of
your
rule
is
to
devalue
any
property
sold
by
the
government
because
it
is
open
to
this
kind
of
challenge
for
deficiency
in
title.
so
you've
now
devalued
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
the
fedex
rule
of
due
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
the
fedex
rule
of
due
process.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
of
any--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
of
any
relevance
to
consider
the
burden
or
the
obligations
that
this
rule
that
petitioners
advocate
place
on
downstream
purchasers?
