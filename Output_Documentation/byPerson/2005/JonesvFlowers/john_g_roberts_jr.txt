chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
jones
v.
flowers.
mr.
kirkpatrick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
search
of...
the
search
of
what?
just
little
rock
or
the
state
of
arkansas?
what
if
this
guy
had
moved
to
chicago?
they...
he'd
be
out
of
luck
under
your
approach
then.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
the
whole
point...
at
least
i
understand...
of
justice
breyer's
question
is
that
you
have
taken
a
step
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
mail
to
get
through
by
insisting
that
the
person
be
there
to
sign
for
it,
and
it's
obviously
more
likely
than
not
he's
not
going
to
be
there.
and
if
you
had
just
used
regular
mail
and
dropped
it
off,
i
think
more
likely
he
would
have
gotten
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
the
purpose
of
certified
mail
is
to
make
sure
you
know
if
it
didn't
get
to
the
person.
and
you
knew
that
and
then
you
didn't
do
anything
about
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
counsel,
one
thing
you
did...
your
client
did
was
provide
notice
by
publication
in
a
local
newspaper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
do
you
bother
doing
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't...
you
don't
rely
on
that
as
in
any
way
discharging
your
constitutional
obligation
to
provide
notice
to
the...
to
the
homeowner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
your...
your
position
is,
though,
when
you've
got
the
certified
letter
returned
is
you
have
no
obligation
to
do
anything
further.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
you
would
get
the
whole...
you'd
just
get
a
little
bit
less
because
the
cost
of
notice
is
borne
by
the
purchaser
and
if
they
have
to
do
a
google
search
or
use
one
of
these
other
services,
it's
going
to
add
a
little
bit
more
to
their
cost,
and
you're
just
going
to
get
a
little
bit
less.
it's
not
going
to
interfere
with
the
administration
of
the
program.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
for
getting
the
property--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--for
getting
the
property
in
this
case,
we're
at
20
percent
of
its
market
value.
it's...
it's
worth
another
$500
to
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
that's...
mr.
phillips,
property
bought
at...
at
delinquent
tax
sales
is
usually
bought
at
far
less
than
its
market
value.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
none
of
this
would
have
been
sufficient
if
we
were
talking
about
your...
your
client,
the
irs.
they
do
far
more
extensive
effort
to
find
the
individual
before
they
sell
property
for
delinquent
taxes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
which
way
is
that...
i
mean,
the
fact
that
he
tried
six
times
and
he
wasn't
there
should
have
told
the
state
this
isn't
working.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
your
position
is
they
don't
have
to
do
anything.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
mullane
said
that
we
look
to
what
a
person
who
really
wanted
to
find
the
person
would
do.
a
person
who
really
wanted
to
find
mr.
jones
and
got
the
certified
letter
back
saying,
nobody
is
claiming
this,
would
have
done
something
more.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which...
which
you
agree
does
no
good
at
all.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
is
the
last
time
you
read
legal
notices
in
a
newspaper?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
have
you
ever
done
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
kirkpatrick,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with...
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
your
client
did
not
alert
the
state
to
its
change
of
address,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
whether
that
his
separation
was
permanent
or
is
that
a
gradual
thing?
i
mean,
did
he
not
know
if
this
was
a
permanent
change
of
address
or
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
may
finish.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
in
04-1477,
jones
versus
flowers.
gary
jones
bought
a
house
in
little
rock,
arkansas
in
1967.
he
lived
in
the
house
with
his
family
until
he
and
his
wife
separated
in
1993.
mr.
jones
then
moved
into
an
apartment
across
town,
and
his
wife
continued
to
live
in
the
house.
mr.
jones
paid
his
mortgage
every
month
for
30
years,
continuing
to
make
the
monthly
payments
even
after
he
moved
out.
he
paid
off
the
mortgage
in
1997.
during
these
30
years,
the
mortgage
company
took
care
of
paying
the
property
taxes
pursuant
to
the
usual
escrow
arrangement.
after
the
mortgage
was
paid
off,
the
property
taxes
went
unpaid.
following
arkansas
law,
the
state
sent
a
certified
letter
to
mr.
jones
at
the
property’s
address.
the
purpose
of
the
letter
was
to
notify
mr.
jones
that
he
had
two
years
to
pay
his
back
taxes,
and
if
he
did
not,
the
state
would
get
its
money
by
taking
his
house
and
selling
it.
nobody
was
home
to
sign
for
the
letter
when
the
postman
came
to
the
door,
and
nobody
appeared
at
the
post
office
to
retrieve
the
letter
within
the
next
two
weeks.
the
post
office
returned
the
letter
to
the
state
marked
“unclaimed”.
for
the
next
two
years,
the
state
made
no
further
effort
to
contact
mr.
jones,
even
though
it
knew
that
he
had
not
received
the
letter.
as
the
two-year
redemption
period
came
to
an
end,
the
state
published
notice
of
its
plan
to
sell
mr.
jones’s
house
in
a
local
newspaper,
and
the
state
eventually
sold
the
house
to
linda
flowers.
when
mrs.
flowers
tried
to
evict
the
jones
family,
mr.
jones’
daughter
called
him
and
told
him
what
had
happened.
mr.
jones
sued
the
commissioner
of
state
lands
and
mrs.
flowers
in
arkansas
court,
arguing
that
the
state
had
not
done
enough
to
try
to
notify
him
before
taking
and
selling
his
house.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
ruled
against
jones,
and
we
granted
review.
the
constitution
says
that
a
state
may
not
take
a
person’s
property
without
due
process
of
law,
and
one
component
of
due
process
is
notice
of
the
impending
taking.
fifty-six
years
ago,
we
decided
an
important
case,
mullane
versus
central
hanover
bank
&
trust,
which
said
that
in
determining
whether
a
state’s
attempted
notice
was
adequate,
we
should
ask
what
would
a
person
who
actually
wanted
to
inform
the
property
owner
of
the
proceedings
against
him
have
done.
we
conclude
that
someone
who
actually
wanted
to
alert
mr.
jones
that
he
was
in
danger
of
something
as
drastic
as
the
potential
loss
of
his
house
would
not
have
simply
given
up
when
the
certified
letter
was
returned.
the
state
should
have
taken
further
steps
to
notify
mr.
jones
that
he
was
in
danger
of
losing
his
house
if
any
reasonable
steps
were
available.
we
are
confident
that
there
were
several
relatively
easy
steps
the
state
could
have
taken
here:
resending
the
letter
by
regular
mail,
posting
notice
on
the
property
or
trying
to
notify
the
current
occupants,
as
well
as
mr.
jones.
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
state
will
ever
be
less
that
fully
zealous
in
its
effort
to
secure
the
tax
revenue
it
needs.
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
the
state’s
efforts
to
ensure
that
its
citizens
receive
proper
notice
before
the
state
takes
action
against
them.
in
this
case,
the
state
is
exerting
extraordinary
power
against
a
property
owner,
taking
and
selling
a
house
he
owns.
it
is
not
too
much
to
insist
that
the
state
do
a
bit
more
to
let
him
know
about
it
when
the
notice
letter
addressed
to
him
is
returned
unclaimed.
for
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk,
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
scalia
and
kennedy
have
joined;
justice
alito
did
not
take
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
