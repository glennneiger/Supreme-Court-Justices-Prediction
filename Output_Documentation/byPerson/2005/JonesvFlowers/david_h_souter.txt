david
h.

how
do...
how
do
we...
i
mean,
this
was
the
problem
i...
i
had
with...
with
your...
your
brief
here,
and
it's
the
same
problem
justice
ginsburg
has.
what
kind
of
weight,
what
significance
do
we
give
to
this
obligation
to
keep
the
government
informed?
on
the
face
of
it,
it
seems
like
a...
an
obligation
that
ought
to
get
considerable
weight.
everybody
knows
that
if
you
own
real
estate,
you've
got
to
pay
real
estate
taxes
on
it.
you're
going
to
have
a
hard
time
doing
that
if
they
don't
know
where
to
send
the
bill,
and
so
on.
so
it
seems
like
a
very
reasonable
obligation
for
the
government
to
put
on
you.
what
weight
do
we
give
that
in...
in
the
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
then
that
would
be
so
even
if
there
were
not
affirmative
obligation
on
the
property
owner.
justice
david
h.
souter
you'd
say,
well,
if
they...
if
they
send
the...
the
notice
to
the
last
address
they
had,
or
if
they
send
it...
since
we're
talking
about
real
estate,
maybe
if
they
send
it
to
the...
to
the
property,
nothing
wrong
with
that.
so
that's
kind
of
a
wash.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
i
want
to
know
what
mr....
i
mean,
it
does
not
relieve
it
of
some
constitutional
obligation,
and
we're
trying
to
figure
out
what
that
is.
and...
and
the
point
of
my
question
is
in
figuring
out
what
it
is,
what
significance
do
we
give
to
the
affirmative
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
property
owner
to
keep
the
government
informed
of
the
address.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then...
then
it
has
no
significance
ever
because
the...
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
use
the
best
address
it
has,
whether
he's
got
an
obligation
to...
to
keep
the
address
updated
or
not.
and...
and
this
is
the...
the
tough
point
for
me
with
your
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
case
depends
on
our
saying
the
obligation
to
keep
the...
the
address
current
has
absolutely
no
significance.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
in...
in
this
case...
i
mean,
i...
you're
probably
right
that
it
would
have...
it
would
have
worked
here,
but
i...
i
take
it
that
in
the
absence
of
that...
that
hindsight,
you
would
say
that
in...
in
the
regular
case
that
simply
posting
notice
on
the
house,
after
the
letter
is
returned,
would
not
be
enough,
that
the...
that
the
posting
on
the
house
would
be
sufficient
only
if
they
had
exhausted
other
efforts
to
get
a
better
address
so
that
in
this
case,
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
example,
they...
they'd
have
to
follow
up
whatever
it
is,
the
18
g.
joneses
or
gary
joneses
that
they
could
find
in
the
phone
book
before
they
could
then
fall
back
and
resort
to
posting
on
the
house.
is...
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
your
argument
be
any
different
if
there
weren't
a
statutory
obligation
to
keep
the
government
informed
of
the...
of
one's
mailing
address?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
a
provision
of
arkansas
law
that
if
in
fact
they
do
track
down
the
property
owner
and
he
is
at
an
address
different
from
the
last
address
that
he
had
given,
that
the
expense
of
tracking
him
down
may
be
charged
to
him,
along
with
the
delinquent
taxes,
penalties,
and
so
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
in
practice
the
answer
is
no?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't...
why
isn't
the
simple
answer
to
that
concern
to
say,
look,
there's
no
way
to
tell
in
advance
or,
you
know,
by
any
general
rule,
at
least
not
legislatively,
how
far
they've
got
to
go
to
try
to
find
the
correct
address,
but
they
know
where
the
house
is
and
they've
got
at
that
point
to
go
to
the
house
and
put
a
notice
on
the
door?
that's
simple,
easy.
why...
why
isn't
that
the
answer?
