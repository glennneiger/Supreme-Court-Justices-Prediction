mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
is
not
about
whether
military
recruiters
will
be
barred
at
the
campus
gates.
congress
had
a
law
on
the
books
that
guaranteed
entry
to
campus,
but
that
was
not
what
congress
really
wanted.
so,
it
passed
a
new
law.
what
congress
really
wants
is
to
squelch
even
the
most
symbolic
elements
of
the
law
schools'
resistance
to
disseminating
the
military's
message,
which
is
why
it
gave
us
the
current
version
of
the
statute.
the
current
version
isolates
for
regulation
the
most
communicative
aspects
of
the
law
schools'
resistance.
the
law
schools--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--are
saying--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
this
is
a
refusal
to
disseminate
the
messages
of
the
military
recruiters.
it
is
a
refusal
to
send
emails,
host
bulletins,
and
make
arrangements
for
mutual
exchange
of
ideas.
it
is
"conduct"
only
in
the
sense
that
they
are
moving
molecules,
but
it's
speech
that
they
are
being
forced
to
engage
in.
and
i
have
to
emphasize,
this
case
is
not
about
entry.
the
solomon
amendment
does
not
require
schools
to
give
entry
to
military
recruiters,
it
requires
them
to
give
entry
to
a
recruiter
only
if
they
provide
entry
to
some--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--other
employer.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor,
for
a
pacifist
religious
institution,
absolutely.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
because
it
has
no
morally
based,
conscious
driven
reason
for
refusing
to
disseminate
that
message.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is,
under
the...
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
the
first
amendment,
it's
actually
relevant
whether
the
reason
for
refusing
to
disseminate
the
message
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor,
it
was
certainly
a
reason
that
they
gave,
and
it
was
based
upon
a
political
view
of
the
legitimacy
of
homosexuality.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
but
i
hasten
to
add,
i'm
not
arguing
that
that
is
a
required
element
of
a
compelled
speech
claim.
i'm
simply
arguing
that
when
someone
has
a
reason
for
resisting
disseminating
a
message,
that
situates
it
further...
closer
to
the
heart
of
the
first
amendment.
congress
came
back,
after
it--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--had
a--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i
accept
that
as
a
proposition
of
the
compelled
speech
doctrine,
absolutely.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
that
in
this
case
what
congress
has
done
is
to
engage
in
the
most
viewpoint
oriented
regulation
of
speech.
the
reason
congress
does
not...
the
reason
congress
is
insisting
that
the
law
schools
disseminate
the
recruiting
messages
is
because
of
the
message
of
the
law--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--schools
themselves--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--in
providing--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor,
and,
under
the
doctrine
of
unconstitutional
conditions,
the
analysis
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
subsequent
cases...
and,
in
fact,
in
dole
itself...
this
court
pointed
out
that
all
bets
are
off
when
there
is
a
superceding
constitutional
right.
here,
we're
talking
about
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
first
amendment.
i
mean,
rosenberger
and
rust--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
that
is
a
government
interest,
for
sure.
all
government
interests--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--can
be--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--traced--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--absolutely
not,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--because--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--what
the
law
schools
are
engaging
in--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
there's
a
difference
between
refusing
to
abide
by
a
universally
applicable
regulation
of
conduct,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
solomon
on...
amendment,
on
the
other
hand,
which
is
refusing
to
assist
the
dissemination
of
a
message.
recruiting
is
all
about
speech.
yes--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--it
has--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
that
is
for
public
schools,
and
public
schools
are
subject
to
the
first
amendment
rights
of
those
who
want
to
enter
their
forum.
but
there
is
a
critical
difference
between
that
forum,
your
honor,
which
the
schools
opened
up
to
everyone,
and
the
forums
in
career
services,
which
the
schools
filter
on
the
basis
of
one
very
important--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
two
messages
going
on
here,
and
they
are
clashing.
there
is
the
military's
message,
which
the
schools
are
interpreting
as,
"uncle
sam
does
not
want
you.
"
and
there
is
the
school's
message,
which
is,
"we
do
not
abet
those
who
discriminate.
"
"that
is
immoral.
"
and--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor.
if
the
university
had
such
a
policy,
then
the
university
would
be
able
to
enforce
it.
but
i
hasten
to
add--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
university--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
at
this
point,
and
for
some--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--several--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--justice
kennedy,
for
several
decades,
law
schools
have
had
these
policies
and
applied
them
to
career
services
offices.
no
other
schools
within
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--universities.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
justice
o'connor,
and--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--let
me
answer
in
two
parts.
first,
of
course,
under
the
compelled
speech
cases,
the
ability
to
protest
the
forced
message
is
never
a
cure
for
compelled
speech
violation,
but--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--what's
going
on--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but,
again,
endorsement
is
also
not
an
element
of
compelled
speech
claim.
but
let
me...
let
me
bring
those
two
questions
together
on
a
factual
point.
the
law
schools
are
disseminating
a
message
that
they
believe
it
is
immoral
to
abet
discrimination.
when--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--they--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--and
when
they
do
it,
your
honor,
the
answer
of
the
students
is,
"we
don't
believe
you.
"
"we
read
your
message
as
being
that
there
are
two
tiers.
"
"there's
a--
"
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--"#
double
standard"--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that's
right,
your
honor.
and
the
problem
with
this
solomon
amendment
is
that
the
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine
says
that
you
can't
put
a
private
speaker
to
that
crisis
of
conscience.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
that's
correct--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
if
it
was...
certainly,
if
it
was
against
their
conscience
to
do
so--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
yes,
your
honor,
unless
there
is
a
compelling
need.
and
the
difficulty
with
the
solomon
amendment--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--anything
that...
not
anything
that
helps
the
military
raise
an
army;
any
communication
that
a
school
is
required
to
engage
in.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
that
is
absolutely
right...
correct,
justice
souter,
which
is
why
i
answered
your
very
early
question
with--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--an
answer
that
is--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--by
conscience--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor.
every
time--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--someone
says
that
as
a
reason
for
refusing
to
host
a
message
of
an
unwelcome
messenger,
that's
a
compelled
speech
violation.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
absolutely,
your--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--honor,
because--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--if...
to
answer
the
first
hypothetical
first,
if
that's
a
matter
of
conscience,
absolutely--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--if
we're
talking--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
they
have
the
same
first
amendment
right.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
but--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--but,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
the
problem
with
the
solomon
amendment
is
that
the
government
is
demanding
absolute
parity.
we
have
a
statute
before
us
that
demands
exactly
the
same
services,
without
regard
to
whether
the
military
actually
needs
them.
in
order
for
congress
to
justify
the
parity
requirement,
which
is
the
only
statute
before
this
court,
congress
has
to
state
a
need.
it
has
to
say
why
it
needs
what--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
this
court
defers
to
congress,
in
matters
of
the
military,
when
the
military
or
the
congress
is
especially
expert
and
this
court
is
especially
naive.
this
court
has
never
deferred
to
a
congressional
statute
about
military
when--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
it
has
to
do
with
expertise,
as
well.
that's
precisely
what
this
court--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--said
in
rostker.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
and
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
direct
answer
to
that
last
question
is
that
all
bets
are
off
when
what
the
government
is
doing
is
compelling
the
speech
of
a
private
actor,
because
the
government
is
not
allowed--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--it
is...
your
honor,
it
is
the
forced
hosting
of
a
messenger
based
decision--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
but--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--with
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--under
the
parity
requirement,
what
the
university
is
compelled
to
do
is
sit
down
with
the
employers
and
help
counsel
them
on
what
their
students
are
interested
in
and
how
best
to
shape
the
message.
the
third
circuit
went
out
of
its
way
to
point
out
that,
and
the
national
association
for
law
placement
brief
is
very
compelling
on
that.
they
also
have
to
disseminate
literature,
post
bulletins
on
bulletin
boards,
help
the
recruiter...
or,
excuse
me,
the
law
firm
develop
cocktail
parties--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor,
there
are--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--it
does
not.
and
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
words
are
used
that
are
incidental
to
an
action.
these
are
not
words
used
that
are
incidental
to
the
action.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no
matter
what
the
government
does,
it
cannot
convert
the
career
services
enterprise
into
value
neutral
proposition.
for
the
law
school,
from
its
perspective,
it's
especially
value
driven.
yes,
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i'm
not
claiming
any
exceptionalism
for
the
law
schools.
the
aaup
brief
does--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--a
brilliant
job--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
as
dale
points
out,
it's
up
to
the
private
institution
to
decide
what
its
metrics--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--are
going
to
be.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
my
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
schools
are
entitled
to
make
their
own
judgments
about
what
messages
they
will
disseminate.
and
even--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor.
but,
i
would
hasten
to
add,
that
is
not
what
recruiters
are
doing.
it
is
no
more
commercial
than
what
united
foods
was
doing
in
an...
advertizing,
saying...
or
resisting
the
message,
"mushrooms
are
good".
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
the
statute
focuses
on
the
manner
of
providing
access;
and
the
manner
of
providing
access
is
through
the
career
services--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
we're
certainly
not
advancing
that
position
here.
the
solomon
amendment
requires
no
such
thing.
the
solomon
amendment
does
not
require
that
schools
give
entry
to
military
personnel.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
it
says
you
must
do
it
only
if
the
other
guy
does
it.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
are...
you're
asking
me
what
i
would
be
arguing
for
my
clients
if
they
were
actually
making--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--taking
that
position?
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
and
that
is
as
to
entry
to
campus,
your
honor?
you're--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--asking
if...
we
are
not
pressing
this
point
to
the
court.
if
the
court
is
asking
what
my
opinion
would
be
if
i--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--were
a
judge--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
if
i
were
advancing
that
argument,
it
would
be,
this
is
a
viewpoint
discriminatory
statute
which
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
the
government
is
advancing
a
single
message,
and,
even
when
the
first
amendment
rights
that
are
at
stake
are
minimal
under
this
court's
opinion
in
r.a.v.,
strict
scrutiny
would
apply.
the
government
has
never
come
forward
which
a
shred
of
evidence
that
it
actually
needs
to
be
on
campus,
as
opposed
to
directly
off
campus,
or
as
opposed
to
publishing
notices
in
student
publications,
or
advertizing.
but--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--we
are
not
advancing--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that
argument.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
the
message
is,
"join
the
army".
what
the
schools
hear
is--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
i'm
sorry.
the
viewpoint
discrimination,
your
honor,
is
in
the
congressional
statute
that
says,
"we
will
force
you
to
host
a
single
speaker
with
a
single
message.
"
just
as
in
pacific
gas--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens,
i
didn't--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
single
message
is,
"join
the
army",
that
is
correct.
and
the
government
is
promoting
only
that
one
message.
but
this--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that
is--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
compelling
interest
on
the
government's
side
is
the
recruitment
interest.
we're
not
arguing
that
the
government
has
a
compelling
interest
in
excluding
anyone.
that's
precisely
why--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
law--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
the
government
wants
to
assert
a
need,
it
has
to
identify
the
need.
it
has
to
say,
"we
need
more
than
contact
information.
"
"we
need
more
than
a
room...
entry
to
campus...
a
room
on
campus,
a
posting
on
a
bulletin
board.
"
"we
need
everything.
"
the
story
of
the
solomon
amendment,
your
honor,
is
the
story
of
private
institutions
trying
desperately
to
accommodate
the
government's
need,
even
in
light
of
their
own
moral
scruples.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
speech
is
on
both
sides,
because
the
schools
are
being
forced
to
host
the
government's
message.
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
message--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
message--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
message
that
the
schools
are
hearing
is,
"join
the
army,
but
not
if
you're
gay.
"
and
the
schools
have
been
trying
desperately
to
accommodate
the
government,
up
until
the
point
where
congress
says,
"we
don't
actually
want
any
of
those
things.
"
"we
want
them
only
if
you
supply
them
to
someone
else.
"
"we
want
them
only
if
you
have
viewpoint
based
reason
that
you
don't
want
to
give
it
to
us.
"
there's
some
reason
in
the
law
school's
conscience,
or
the
academic
institution's
conscience,
that
it
wants
to
treat
this
category
of
employers
differently
from
any
other.
congress's--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
congress,
here,
is
imposing
a
sanction,
which
this
court
has
treated
as
exactly
the
same
as
a
penalty.
when--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
again,
we're
not--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--we
are
not
talking
about--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--coming
on
campus.
we
are
talking
about
affirmative
assistance
to
the
highest
degree--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--in
disseminating
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
answer
is
yes,
your--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--it's
very--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--it
is
very
important
to
distinguish
obstruction
from
refusal
to
subsidize,
which,
at
the
government's
instance,
this
court
has
been
doing
for
30
years,
both--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--it
is
refusal
to
treat
them
the
same
as
everyone
else,
because
they
are
not
the
same
as
everyone
else
in
the
law
schools'
estimation.
and
the
government--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
the
government
has
to
identify
precisely
what
its
need
is,
why
it
needs
yale
college
personnel
rather
than
yale...
excuse
me...
why
it
needs
yale
law
school
personnel
rather
than
yale
college
personnel--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--to
make
the
appointments.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
the...
this
is
not
about
application
of
the
statute
in
one
circumstance.
the
whole
statute
has
to
be
struck
down,
because
the
government
is
demanding
absolute
parity
and
there's
no
way
for
this
court
to
rewrite
the
statute.
we
don't
know
whether
congress
would
go
back
and
go
to
the
entry
requirement,
just
bear
entry,
to
entry
plus,
or
to
a
parity
requirement,
which
is...
which
it
has
now
shifted
to.
so,
there
is
simply
no
way
to
know
exactly
how
congress
would
rewrite
the
statute.
but
this
is,
at
its
heart,
an
as
applied
challenge.
it's
about
law
schools
with
nondiscrimination
policies.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
thank
you--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honors.
