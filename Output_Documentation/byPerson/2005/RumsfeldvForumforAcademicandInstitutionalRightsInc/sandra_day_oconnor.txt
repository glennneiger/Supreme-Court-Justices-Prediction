yes,
but
it
says...
i
thought
it
says
that
the
military
must
have
equal
access
with
any
other
employer.
now,
every
other
employer
is
subject
to
the
same
policy,
presumably,
of
the
law
school.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
another
question
that
may
shed
a
little
light
on
it.
does
the
solomon
amendment
pose
any
restrictions
on
the
extent
to
which
the
law
schools
can
distance
themselves
from
the
military's
views?
can
there
be
signs
up
at
every
recruitment
office,
saying,
"our
law
school
doesn't
agree
with
any
discrimination
against
gays?
"
i
mean,
can
they
come
forward
with
their
position
on
this
in
every
recruitment
office
without
violation
of
the
amendment?
justice
sandra

o'connor
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
law
school
is
entirely
free
to
convey
its
message
to
everyone
who
comes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
how
is
the
message
affected--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
that
environment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--they
can
say
that
to
every
student
who
enters
the
room.
