justice

when
you
say
that
it
asks
what
other
employers
receive,
but
these
institutions,
i
gather,
would
not
allow
other
employers,
who
have
the
same
policy
against
the
hiring
of
homosexuals,
to
interview
at
their
institutions.
so,
you're
receiving
what
other
employers
in
the
same
situation
would
receive.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
seems
me
you've
got
us
off
galloping
in
the
wrong
direction.
the
statute
doesn't
require
simply
giving
the
same
access
that
you
give
to
other
employers.
it
requires
much
more
than
that.
it
requires
that
they...
it
prohibits,
or
cuts
off,
funds
if
an
institution
either
prohibits
or,
in
effect,
prevents
the
secretary
of
a
military
department
from
gaining
access
to
campuses
for
purposes
of
military
recruiting
in
a
manner
that
is
at
least
equal
in
quality
and
scope
to
the
access
to
campuses
and
to
students
that
is
provided
to
any
other
employer.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
demands
more
than
simply
you
give
the
same
access
as
all
other
employers.
if
you
allow
any
other
employer,
you
have
to
give
it
to
the
military
in
the
same
manner.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
title
x
of
the
united
states
code
deal
with?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
chose
to
defend
this
principally
on
the
basis
of
the
spending
clause,
and
not
on
the
basis
of
what
it...
what
it
was,
seemed
to
me,
enacted
in
order
to
achieve,
and
that
is
the
congressional
power
to
raise
and
support
armies.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
happens,
in
this
case,
to
be
specifically
authorized
by
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cannot
convert
a
law
into
a
law
directed
at
the
first...
at
first
amendment
rights,
can
you,
by
simply
saying,
"the
reason
i
am
disobeying
it
is
to
express...
whatever,
disaffection
with
the
war,
my
objection
to
homosexuality,
or
anything
else...
or
to
homosexual
discrimination...
or
anything
else?
"
does
that
convert
it
to
a
law
directed
against
the
first
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
going
to
be
an
army
recruiter,
are
you?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--having
students
driven
off.
and
if
you
have
jeering
and
picketing,
do
you
really
think
that
that
fulfills
the
purposes
of
this
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
where
do
you
find
that?
in...
it
has
to
be
a
morally
based,
conscience
driven--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
we
were
talking
about
freedom
of
speech,
not
the
religion
clauses.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
do
about
the...
about
the
cases
where
we
have
required
colleges
to
allow
some
student
activities
to
put
forward
their
views
on
campus,
when
other
student
activities
are
allowed
to
do
that?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
flatly
contradicts
the
proposition
that
when
you
compel
an
institution
to
permit
somebody
else
to
speak,
you
are
violating
that
institution's
first
amendment
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
saying
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
every
time
somebody
gives
as
his
reason
for
violating
a
law
that
he
wants
to
send
a
message
that
he
disagrees
with
that
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
raises
a
first
amendment
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--here's
a
need.
how
about
this?
we
have
said
in
our
opinions...
and
i
am
quoting
from
rostker
versus
goldberg...
"judicial
deference
is
at
its
apogee
when
legislative
action
under
the
congressional
authority
to
raise
and
support
armies
and
make
rules
and
regulations
for
their
governance
is
challenged.
"
and
that's
precisely
what
we
have
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
has
to
do
with
expertise.
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
immense
national
importance.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rosenkranz,
could
you
tell
me
which
elements
of
your
argument
rest
upon
compelled
actual
speech
and
which
rest
upon
compelled
symbolic
speech?
because
the
latter,
i
have
to
tell
you,
i'm
not
very
fond
of.
what
compelled
actual
speech
is
imposed
on
the...
you
mentioned
something
about
emails,
they
have
to
send
emails
to
say
where
the
recruiter
will
be
located--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
the
compelled
speech
you're
worried
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
symbolic
speech.
i'm
talking
about
actual
speech.
what
expression
is
the
university...
real,
you
know,
words...
words...
is
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--university--
justice
antonin
scalia
--compelled
to
utter
by
this
legislation?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
suppose
when
you...
when
the
police
knock
at
the
door
and
say,
you
know,
"i
have
a
warrant",
i
suppose
somebody
has
to
say,
"come
in".
is
that
compelled
speech?
does
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--does
that...
does
that
raise
a
first
amendment
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
that
a
law
school
faculty
could
decide
that
it
does
not
favor
a
particular
war,
and
use
that
as
the
basis
for
excluding
recruiters,
"by
allowing
this
recruiter
to
come
on
campus,
you
are
making
me
speak,
in
effect,
to
our
students,
saying,
'join
the
army
and
fight
the
war
that
we're
now
engaged
in.
"
"'.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
"and
i
don't
want
to
do
that.
"
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
would
be
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
okay--
justice
antonin
scalia
--fine.
i'm
saying
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
would
say
that
the
same
situation
would
apply
if
the
university
faculty
does
not
favor
the
particular
war
that
the
united
states
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--engaged
in,
and,
therefore,
obstructs
the
effort
to
raise--
justice
antonin
scalia
--an
army--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
not
allowing
them
to
come
on
campus.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
obstruction
when
you
refuse
to
give
them
what
you
give
what
you
give
everybody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
--fighting
a
war.
