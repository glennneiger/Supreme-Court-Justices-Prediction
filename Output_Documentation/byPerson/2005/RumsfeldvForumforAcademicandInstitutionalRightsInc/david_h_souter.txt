justice
david
h.
souter
well,
your
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
but
even
if
you
do
that,
you're
still
left,
it
seems
to
me,
with
the
problem...
whether
you
characterize
the
problem
as
discriminatory
and
antidiscriminatory
university
policy
or
not,
you're
still
left
with
a
speech
problem
that
they
raise,
that,
in
effect,
you
are
forcing
them,
in
effect,
to
underwrite
your
speech,
up
to
a
point,
and
you
are
forcing
them
to
change
their
own
message.
you're
forcing
them
into
hypocrisy,
in
one
alternative.
and
those
arguments
don't
depend
upon
the...
sort
of,
the
discriminatory
character
of
what
may
be
at
stake.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
discrimination--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
no
discrimination,
you've
got
a
speech
issue
that
you're
going
to
address.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
making
a...
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
you
are
making
a
kind
of
o'brien
argument
that
the...
that
the
burden
on
speech,
whatever
it
may
be,
is
an
incidental
burden
to
something
else.
well,
that...
i
think
we
have
to
draw
this
line
between
recruiting,
on
the
one
hand,
which
is
what
the
military
wants
to
do,
and
the
solomon
amendment,
on
the
other
hand.
as
i
understand
it,
the
solomon
amendment
is
directed,
or
is
responsive,
entirely
to
positions
taken
by
law
schools
on,
among
other
things,
first
amendment
expressive
grounds,
so
that
if
we
are
going
to
address
the
solomon
amendment,
i
think
we
are
addressing
an
exclusively
first
amendment
speech
expression
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--know
of
any
other
reason
for
the
solomon
amendment.
justice
david
h.
souter
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
they're...
but
the
solomon
amendment,
in
order
to
accomplish
that,
is
addressed
to
a
particular
expressive
problem
which
occurs
for
the
military...
and
for
the
law
schools,
for
that
matter...
in
law
school
recruiting.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that...
for...
i
mean,
my
only
point
is
that
the
solomon
amendment
seems
to
have
one
objective.
whereas,
the
"don't
burn
your
draft
card
rule",
in
o'brien,
had
two...
or
had
a...
let's
say,
had
a
primarily
nonspeech
objective
with
an
incidental
speech
burden.
here,
the
sole
objective,
in
the
real
world,
seems
to
be
an
expressive
objective.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
this
express--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
the
expressive
objective
is,
the
law
schools
are
taking
a
position
on
first
amendment
grounds.
that
position
is
interfering
with
military
recruitment.
no
question
about
it.
i
don't
know
how
much,
but
i
will
assume
that
there
is
no
question
about
it.
the
solomon
amendment
is
addressed
solely,
as
i
understand
it,
at
the
expressive
activities
which
have,
as
you
say,
this
interference.
its
sole
objective
is
expressive.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is...
what
about
hurley?
is
there
something
deeply
moral
or
conscience
driven
about
the
position
to
exclude
the
gay
rights
contingent
in
the
parade,
in
hurley?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me,
that...
i
understand
that,
so
far
as
the
associational
claim
may
go.
but
so
far
as
the
speech
claims
may
go,
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can
say,
or
refuse
to
say,
anything
i
want
to,
for
any
reason
i
want
to,
however
bad
that
reason,
however
nonmoral
that
reason
is.
and
i
don't
see
how,
in
the
speech...
on
the
speech
claims,
we
get
into
moral
basis
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but,
mr.
rosenkranz,
isn't
the...
i
thought
the
distinction
was
that
in
determining
the
forum
for
recruiting,
the
university
is
speaking.
the
university
isn't
creating
a
forum
from
a
lot...
for
a
lot
of
third
parties;
it's
speaking,
itself.
and
i
understand
the
essence
of
your
claim
to
be
that
its
speech
is
being
affected,
either
by
being
mixed
with
something
it
doesn't
want
to
say
or
by
being,
in
effect,
forced
to
support
it
doesn't...
something
it
does
not
want
to
say.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
point?
i
mean,
your
point
is
not
that...
as
i
understand,
that,
for
any
reason,
if
the...
if
the
university,
for
any
reason,
during
world
war
ii,
had
excluded
recruiters,
and
there
had
been
the
equivalent
of
the
solomon
amendment,
that
there
would
have
been
a
first
amendment
problem.
as
i...
is...
maybe
i
don't
understand
your
argument,
but
i
thought
your
argument
was,
or
is,
that
if
they
do
it
for
some
purpose
of
conscience,
which
implies
a
message...
e.g.,
if
it
is
a
pacifist
college...
there
would
be
a
first
amendment
problem.
but
if
they're
doing
it
simply
because
space
is
short
and
they
would
rather
provide
one
more
biology
classroom,
there
wouldn't
be
a
first
amendment
problem,
world
war
ii
or
today,
would
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
your
argument
was,
the
single
message
is,
"join
the
army,
but
not
if
you're
gay.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
leads
me
to
the
question,
in
response
to
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
a
moment
ago,
in
your
view
is
the
compelling
interest
on
the
part
of
the
government
recruitment
or
the
refusal
to
accept
gays?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but,
are
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--are
you
saying
that
the
government...
that
the
only
compelling
interest
argument
that
the
government
can
raise
here
is
the
discriminatory
argument?
since
nobody
denies
that,
if
the
government
were
recruiting
without
the
discrimination,
that
there
would...
there
would...
there
would
be
no
problem
with
it.
everyone
would
agree
with...
that
that
was
a
compelling--
justice
david
h.
souter
--interest.
but,
i
thought
your
argument
on
compelling
interest
was
that
the
only
compelling
interest
that
the
government
can
assert
is
the
discriminatory
interest.
