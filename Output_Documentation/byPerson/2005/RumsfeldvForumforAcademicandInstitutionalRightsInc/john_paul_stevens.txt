john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--brief
question?
would
that
be
true
if
the
university
didn't
allow
any
access
whatsoever
to
any
employer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
the
regulatory
matter.
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
question,
to
follow
up
on
justice
o'connor's
thought.
can...
are
you
saying
that
the
school
can
engage
in
speech
expressing
its
views
about
the
military
policies,
can
engage
in
symbolic
speech
by
affording
access,
which
is
equal
in
all
functional
requirements,
but
yet
sends
a
message
that
they
are
really
disagreeing
with
what's
going
on
by,
say...
let
a
law
school
say,
"well,
for...
most
employers
will
let
you
use
the
regular
law
school
placement
facilities,
but,
for
the
military,
we
will
require
you
use
the
college
facilities
to
send
a
message
that
we
disapprove,
if
the
college
facility
is
equally
of...
good,
as
a
matter
of
functioning?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
equal
because
of
the
message
it
sends
or
because
it
denies
the
opportunity
to
recruit
as
effectively?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
i
had
an
example
where
they
were
equal...
equally
effective
as
recruitment
avenues.
could
they...
could
they
make
the
military
take
one
that
was
equally
effective,
but
it
sent
a
message,
"well,
we
really
don't
like
what
you're
doing?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
does
your
agreement,
that
you
can
engage
in
speech
by
posting
banners
or
handing
a
note,
apply
to
symbolic
speech--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
kind
of
conduct
that
is
symbolic
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
a
functional--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
a
functional
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
i
have
one
thing
straight?
the
content
of
the
compelled
speech,
as
i
understand
it,
is
you're
aiding
in
the
recruitment
of
the
armed
forces,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
still
have
been
compelled
speech
if,
25
years
ago,
congress
passed
a
statute
saying,
"university,
you
must
allow
our
people
on
campus
to
recruit.
"
and
they
some...
for
some
reason,
didn't
want
to
help.
but
that
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
school
if
there
were
no
other
debate,
just
they
didn't
want
the
army
on
because
they
had
to
provide
facilities
that
would
aid
recruitment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it
would
have
violated
the
first
amendment
during
world
war
ii
when
the...
whenever
they
are
trying
to
raise
an
army,
if
they
had
compelled
an
unwilling
university
to
provide
recruitment
facilities
to
the
military.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
be
compelled
speech,
though,
in
your
view.
that's
the
kind
of
speech
we're
talking
about,
anything
that
helps
the
military
raise
an
army.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
why
isn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
agree
that
it
is
violated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--were
talking
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
government's
message,
the
message
is,
"join
the
army".
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
a
viewpoint
discriminatory
message.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
single
message
is,
"join
the
army".
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
single
message
is,
"join
the
army".
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
question,
with
that
very
point
in
mind?
does
it
necessarily
follow,
if
there
are
occasional
applications
of
this
statute
that
might
be
invalid,
that
the
whole
solomon
amendment
needs
to
be
struck
down?
