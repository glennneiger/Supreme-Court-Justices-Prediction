mr.

no,
that's--
chief

john

--i'm
sorry,
but
the
most
communicative
aspect
is
saying
what
you
think
about
a
particular
policy.
this
is
conduct,
denying
access
to
the
military
recruiters.

john

well,
no
that--
chief

john

--so,
if
you

policy
that,
"we're
going

deny

do
you
think
that

what
about

south
dakota
had
a

yet
we
upheld

that

they
had
to

the

04-1152,
rumsfeld
versus
forum
for
academic
and
institutional
rights.
the
forum
for
academic
and
institutional
rights,
which
goes
by
the
acronym
fair,
is
an
association
of
law
schools
and
law
faculties.
its
members
have
adopted
policies
expressing
their
opposition
to
discrimination
based
on,
among
other
factors,
sexual
orientation.
according
to
fair,
the
government’s
policy
on
homosexuals
in
the
military
violates
fair’s
nondiscrimination
policies.
as
a
result,
law-school
members
of
fair
began
limiting
access
to
their
campuses
and
students
for
military
recruiters.
congress
responded
by
enacting
the
solomon
amendment.
under
this
statute,
if
any
part
of
a
university,
like
a
law
school,
denies
military
recruiters
access
equal
to
that
provided
other
recruiters,
the
entire
university
loses
certain
federal
funding.
the
law
school
sued,
alleging
that
the
solomon
amendment
infringes
their
first
amendment
rights
of
free
speech
and
association.
the
district
court
refused
to
block
enforcement
of
the
solomon
amendment
because,
in
its
view,
the
law
schools
were
not
likely
to
win
on
their
first
amendment
claims.
the
district
court
thought
the
solomon
amendment
regulated
conduct,
not
speech,
and
concluded
that
the
first
amendment
was
not
violated.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
solomon
amendment
was
unconstitutional,
because
it
forced
law
schools
to
choose
between
surrendering
first
amendment
rights
and
losing
federal
funding.
the
court
thought
the
statute’s
equal-access
requirement
did
regulate
the
law
school’s
speech
and
thus
violated
the
school’s
freedom
of
speech
and
association.
we
agreed
to
review
this
decision.
the
solomon
amendment
regulates
conduct,
not
speech.
it
affects
what
law
schools
must
do
--
afford
equal
access
to
military
recruiters
--
not
what
they
may
or
may
not
say.
law
schools
remain
free
to
express
whatever
views
they
may
have
on
the
government’s
policy
on
homosexuals
in
the
military,
all
the
while
retaining
eligibility
for
federal
funding.
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
solomon
amendment
violates
law
schools’
freedom
of
speech
in
a
number
of
ways.
first,
in
assisting
military
recruiters,
law
schools
provide
some
services,
such
as
sending
emails
and
distributing
flyers,
that
clearly
do
involve
speech.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
in
supplying
these
services,
law
schools
are
compelled
to
speak
the
government’s
message.
this
sort
of
recruiting
assistance,
however,
is
a
far
cry
from
the
compelled
speech
we
have
previously
found
to
be
unconstitutional.
compelling
a
law
school
that
sends
scheduling
emails
for
other
recruiters
to
send
one
for
a
military
recruiter
is
simply
not
the
same
as
the
compelled
speech
in
our
prior
cases,
for
example,
forcing
a
student
to
pledge
allegiance
or
forcing
a
jehovah’s
witness
to
display
the
motto
“live
free
or
die”
on
his
automobile
license
plate.
the
compelled
speech
here
is
plainly
incidental
to
the
regulation
of
conduct,
and
that
has
never
been
considered
an
abridgement
of
free
speech.
second,
military
recruiters
are,
to
some
extent,
speaking
while
they
are
in
campus.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
by
forcing
law
schools
to
permit
the
military
on
campus
to
express
its
message,
the
solomon
amendment
unconstitutionally
requires
law
schools
to
host
or
accommodate
the
military
speech.
when
we
have
found
a
compelled
speech
violation,
however,
it
is
been
because
the
complaining
speaker’s
own
message
was
affected
by
the
speech
it
was
forced
to
accommodate.
in
this
case,
accommodating
the
military’s
message
does
not
affect
the
law
school’s
speech,
because
the
schools
are
not
speaking
when
they
simply
host
recruiting
interviews
and
receptions.
nothing
about
recruiting
suggests
that
law
schools
agree
with
any
speech
by
recruiters,
and
nothing
in
the
solomon
amendment
restricts
what
the
law
schools
may
say
about
the
military’s
policies.
we
have
held
that
high-school
students
can
appreciate
the
difference
between
speech
their
school
sponsors
and
speech
it
permits
because
it
is
legally
required
to
do
so.
surely
students
have
not
lost
that
ability
by
the
time
they
get
to
law
school.
third,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
if
the
solomon
amendment
regulates
conduct,
this
conduct
is
nonetheless
expressive,
and
regulating
it
infringes
law
schools’
right
to
engage
in
expressive
conduct.
we
have
rejected
the
view
that
conduct
can
be
labeled
speech
whenever
the
person
engaging
in
the
conduct
intends
to
express
an
idea.
not
paying
your
taxes
may
be
a
way
to
express
opposition
to
the
irs,
but
your
action
is
going
to
be
evaluated
as
conduct,
not
speech.
instead,
we
have
extended
first
amendment
protection
only
to
conduct
that
is
inherently
expressive,
for
example,
burning
the
american
flag;
but
unlike
flag-burning,
the
conduct
regulated
by
the
solomon
amendment
is
not
inherently
expressive.
the
expressive
component
of
a
law
school’s
actions
is
created
not
by
the
conduct
itself,
but
by
the
speech
that
accompanies
it.
if
combining
speech
and
conduct
were
enough
to
create
expressive
conduct,
a
person
could
always
transform
conduct
into
speech
simply
by
talking
about
it.
the
solomon
amendment
does
not
violate
law
schools’
freedom
of
speech,
but
the
first
amendment’s
protection
extends
beyond
the
right
to
speak.
we
have
recognized
a
first
amendment
right
to
associate
for
the
purpose
of
speaking,
which
we
have
termed
a
freedom
of
expressive
association.
the
law
schools
argue
that
the
solomon
amendment
violates
their
freedom
of
expressive
association,
because
the
presence
of
military
recruiters
on
campus
significantly
affects
their
ability
to
express
the
message
that
discrimination
based
on
sexual
orientation
is
wrong.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed;
we
do
not.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
one
of
our
previous
decisions,
in
which
we
held
that
the
boy
scouts’
freedom
of
expressive
association
was
violated
by
a
state
law
requiring
the
organization
to
accept
a
homosexual
as
a
scoutmaster.
the
solomon
amendment,
however,
does
not
similarly
affect
a
law
school’s
associational
rights.
to
comply
with
the
statute,
law
schools
must
allow
military
recruiters
on
campus
and
assist
them
in
whatever
way
the
school
assists
other
employers.
but
recruiters
are
not
part
of
a
law
school.
recruiters
are
outsiders
who
come
onto
campus
to
attempt
to
hire
students,
not
to
become
members
of
the
school’s
expressive
association.
for
these
reasons,
which
are
stated
more
fully
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
all
members
of
the
court
join
the
opinion
except
for
justice
alito,
who
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
decision
in
the
case.
