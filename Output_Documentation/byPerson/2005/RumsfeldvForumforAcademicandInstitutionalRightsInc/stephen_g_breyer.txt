justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
constitutional
argument,
i
guess,
is,
"does
the
constitution
require
access...
is...
does
it
permit
a
statute
which
says
you
have
to
give
access
to
the
military,
when
you
wouldn't
give
access
to
any
other
employer?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
then
what
you're
saying,
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
then
what's
the
answer
to
that
question,
"does
the
constitution"...
how
does
the...
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
it
is
an
important
question,
because
the...
there
is
an
amicus
brief
that
says,
"go
read
the
statute".
and,
really,
the
statute
was
not
about
homosexuals
in
the
military,
it
was
a
statute
about
universities
in
vietnam
not
letting
military
people
on
campus.
so,
in
the...
at
the
heart
of
the
statute
was
a
matter
which
was
unique
to
the
military.
now,
this
is
a
matter
that
isn't
unique
to
the
military.
so,
why
not
interpret
the
statute
in
the
way
that
the
amicus
brief
suggests
in
order
to
avoid
a
difficult
constitutional
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
isn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
isn't
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
there
are--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--students--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
in
fact,
to
be
clear,
you
also
think
schools
that
are
angry
at
the
military
because
they're
too
favorable
to
gays
in
the
military,
they
have
the
same
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
also
the
same
right
bob
jones
university,
because
they
disapprove
of
social
mixing
of
the
races?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
what...
and
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
the
country,
they
may...
there's
few,
anyway...
may
not
believe
in
either
affirmative
action,
they
may
not
believe
in...
they
may
not
believe
in
diversity,
they
may
not...
they
may
even
believe
in
racial
segregation,
for
all
i
know.
i
hope
there
are
not
too
many--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
there
might,
and
those
people
all
have
the
same
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
so,
if
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
that's
the
case,
then
of
course
it's
going
to
be
pretty
tough--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
the
military
to
get
people
on
campus.
and
i
just
wonder,
if
that's
an
important
need,
why
you
don't
have
here
what
i'd
say
is
normal
in
the
first
amendment
area,
that
the
remedy
for
speech
you
don't
like,
is
not
less
speech,
it
is
more
speech.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
would--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
would
like
the
answer
to
my
question,
because
i'm
thinking,
as
you
correctly
say,
if
you
have
that
right,
so
do
all
the
worse
segregationists
you
can
imagine,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
here...
yes,
and
here
there
is
a
need
of
some
kind
to
get
the
military
in.
and
what
the
government
in
this
statute
asks
you...
because
i,
personally,
couldn't
find
anything
in
the
record
that
finds
that
student
who
thinks,
by
letting
the
military
person
in,
that
that
school,
which
basically
is
completely
against
the
military
in
this
area,
suddenly
becomes
for
it.
and
i
haven't
even
found
in
the
record
an
instance
where
there
was
a
recruiter
who
told
people
that
they
couldn't
join
the
military
if
they
were
gay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
we
have
not
a
tremendous
demonstration
there
of
a
need
on
the
university
side.
and
my
question
was,
what's
wrong
with
the
government
saying,
"university,
you
disapprove
of
what
we
do.
"
"the
remedy
for
such
a
situation
is
not
less
speech,
it
is
more
speech.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
go
and
explain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
agree
with
the
government,
that
the
statute,
as
fairly
interpreted,
is
violated
when
a
school
which
uniformly
applies
to
all
employers
the
rule,
"you
can't
come
in
if
you
have
the
discrimination
against
hiring
gay
people?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
speech
is
on
their
side.
the
government
just
says,
"let
our
recruiters
in".
so,
why
isn't
it
sort
of
like,
"pay
the
property
tax"?
"i
don't
want
to.
"
"i
hate
the
government.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"#
i'm
withholding
the
money
because
i
want
to
express
my
message.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
message
is,
"join
the
army".
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--message
of
the
property
tax
is,
"pay
the...
pay
for
the--
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--"#
government's
expenses".
