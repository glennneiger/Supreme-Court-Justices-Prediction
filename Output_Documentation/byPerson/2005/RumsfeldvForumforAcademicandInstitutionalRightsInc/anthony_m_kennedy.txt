well,
that's
fine,
but
you
were
the
one
that
made
the
argument
that
they
want
the
same
access
as
other
employers.
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
you...
i
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--want
to
make
sure
what
the
calculus
is,
at
the
outset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
resistance
to
any
statute,
i
assume,
could
be
justified
as
symbolic
speech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean,
they
could
organize
a
student
protest
at
the
hiring
interview
rooms,
so
that
everybody
jeers
when
the
applicant
comes
in
the
door
and
the
school
could
organize
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as...
when
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
it's,
say,
a
job
fair,
and
all
the
employers
are
there,
but
then
they
jeer
just
the...
and
the
school
organizes
a
line
jeering
the...
both
the
recruiters
and
the
applicants,
that's
equal
access?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
surprised
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
think
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
worried
about--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
think
if
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--have
jeering--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--jeering
and
picketing
if
a
black
person
came
to
recruit
and
people
didn't...
and
a
school
faculty
didn't
like
blacks?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that
that's
an
extraordinary
position
you're
taking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
talking--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--about
the
practical
meaning
of
"equal
access".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
you're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
you're
arguing
is
that
what
is,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
"conduct"
can
be
infused
by
the
school,
at
its
option,
with
a
first
amendment
quality.
yet
your
argument
would
allow
schools
to
exclude
anybody
in
uniform
from
a
cafeteria.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
an
express...
it's
an...
it's
solely
for
an
expressive
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
for
members--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--for
medical
schools,
we
can't
get
medical
schools
for
our
armed
forces...
chaplains,
the
same
way,
because
it...
schoolteachers
who
teach
on
military
bases...
in
order
to
make
the
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
all
for
an
expressive
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
happening
here
is
the
perspective
employers,
the
recruiters,
are
proposing
a
commercial
transaction.
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
a
simple
matter
for
the
law
schools
to
have
a
disclaimer
on
all
of
their
emails
and
advertisements
that
say,
"the
law
school
does
not
approve...
and,
in
fact,
disapproves...
of
the
policies
of
some
of
the
employers
who
you
will
meet.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
law
schools
have
an
interest
in
the
constitution
that
other
people
don't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
well,
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
suppose,
under
your
view,
law
schools
really
shouldn't
permit
firms...
law
firms
on
campus
if
those
firms,
say,
oppose...
take
litigation
positions
opposing
gay
marriage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
your
position.
your
position
is,
the
schools
could,
and
probably
should,
do
that
to
make
their
message
known.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
with
reference
to
commercial...
proposed
commercial
transactions?
