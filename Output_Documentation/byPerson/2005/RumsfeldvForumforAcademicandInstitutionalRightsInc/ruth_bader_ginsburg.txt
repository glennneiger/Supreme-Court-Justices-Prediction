justice
ruth
bader

--general--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--clement,
do
i
understand,
with
respect
to
that
brief
that
offered
a
statutory
interpretation
to
avoid
a
constitutional
question,
your
answer
is,
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
we
now
have?
and
if
we're
talking
about
a
predecessor
statute
in
1968,
from
the
vietnam
days,
that...
this
would
have
been
a
highly
academic
question,
because
there
weren't
any
such
policies
in
any
law
schools
with
respect
to
recruiting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--be
rather
farfetched.
the
pitch
that's
being
made
is
an
equality
pitch,
that
we
are
teaching
our
students
equality,
the
equal
stature
of
all
people.
so,
i
think
that
your
example
does
not
fit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
clement,
can
you
be
affirmative
now?
because
we
have
an
example,
from
justice
stevens,
which
is
the
yale
example.
the...
it
was
the
main
campus,
instead
of
the
law
school.
what...
the
recruiter
is
there.
he's
in
the
same
room
that
other
recruiters
use.
what
can
the
law
faculty
do
to
disassociate
itself
from...
to
say
that,
"we
don't
tolerate
discrimination
of
any
kind?
"
what
can
the
law
school
do,
concretely,
while
the
recruiter
is
in
the
room?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
would
take,
mr.
rosenkranz,
that
same
position.
if
this
was
not
special
to
law
faculties...
i
mean,
we're
told
that
the
recruiters
could
go
to
the
main
campus;
most
of
these
places,
the
restriction
is
limited
to
the
law
faculties.
suppose
it
was
universitywide
policy
that
we
do
not
give
equal
access
to
military
recruiters.
i
think
your
argument
says
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
special
to
the
law
school
or
the
whole
university.
do
i
understand
it
correctly?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
compel
the
speech
of
a
private
actor
when
the
government
says,
"colleges
and
universities,
you
are
not
going
to
get
federal
money
if
you
discriminate
on
grounds
of
race
or
gender.
"
"and
we
don't
care
what
your
private
attitude
may
be,
we
will
refuse
to
contract,
we
will
debar
you
from
future
contracts,
if
you
don't...
not
only
say,
'we
won't
discriminate,
'
but
have
an
affirmative
action
plan.
"
you
know
that
is
not
hypothetical.
this
was
the
u.s.
policy
in
the
early
'70s.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
require
any
accommodation...
i
mean,
you
have
said,
"it's
up
to
the
faculty
to
choose
which
causes
to
assist.
"
--i
think
you
put
it
that
way,
or
one
of
the
amici
did...
"and
which
to
resist".
and
you've
already
told
me
that
this
happens
to
be
the
law
school,
could
be
the
whole
university.
could
the
law
faculty,
or
the
university,
take
the
position,
"we're
not
going
to...
we
don't
like
your
message,
and
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
have
any
of
our
facilities.
"
"we're
not
going
give
you
the
room
on
the
main
campus.
"
"just
a
total
bar?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
but
a
school--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
school,
as
a
matter
of
its
own
policy
says,
"we
don't
like
discrimination,
and
we're
not
going
to
give
discriminators
access
to
any
of
our
facilities,
period.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you,
is
there
any
obligation,
since
you've
said
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest...
compelling
government
interest
in
recruiting,
is
there
some
obligation
to
accommodate,
or
could
the
faculty
just
say,
"we
choose
the
causes
that
we
assist
and
the
ones
we
resist?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
the...
if
it
logically
follows,
from
your
position,
about
"choosing
the
causes
we
resist
and
the
ones
that
we
assist.
"
