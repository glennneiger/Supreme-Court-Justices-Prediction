mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
solomon
amendment
conditions
the
federal
funding
of
educational
institutions
on
receiving
something
that
any
donor
would
expect,
the
opportunity
to
recruit
students
educated
at
the
funded
institutions.
that
opportunity
allows
the
military
a
fair
shot
at
recruiting
the
best
and
the
brightest
for
the
military's
critical
and
vital
mission.
the
federal
government
does
not
insist
on
any
predetermined
level
of
access;
rather,
it
simply
asks
what
other
employers
receive.
likewise,
the
recipient
schools
remain
free
to
criticize
the
military
and
its
policies,
and,
of
course,
they
remain
free
to
decline
federal
funds
altogether.
as
a
result
of
these
circumstances,
the
solomon
amendment
comports
with
both
the
constitution
and
with
common
sense.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
you
have
to
look
at
the...
i
think,
the
statute
in
two
steps.
one
is,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
it
gives
the
military
a
right
to
gain
access
to
campus
as
a
condition,
that
it
has...
that
they
have
to
gain
access
to
campus
in
order
to
perform
their
military
recruitment.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
respect,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
there's
several
points
to
be
made
in
response
to
that.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
solomon
amendment
itself
is
a
recognition
that
the
military
is
not
like
any
other
employer
for
purposes
of
its
policy
and
its
treatments
of
homosexuals.
and
i
think
that,
unlike
any
other
employer,
the
military's
policy
is
a
result
of
a
congressional
mandate.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
what--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what
i
would
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
point
i
would
say
is,
in
terms
of
gaining
access
to
campus,
we
want
to
gain
access
at
a
level,
and
under
circumstances,
that
perhaps
some
other
employer
would
be
excluded.
well,
once
access
is
gained,
then
the
question
arose
under
the
prior
version
of
the
statute,
all
right,
if
access
is
gained,
what
level
of
access
suffices?
and
on
that
second
order
question
of
what
level
of
access
suffices,
then
you
look
to
what
is
provided
to
any
other
employer.
and
so,
that's
why,
when
i
say
that
we
don't
ask
for
any
predetermined
level,
we
don't
ask
for
seven
meetings
a
year,
we
don't
ask
for
entrance
into
the
public
address
system
or
the
email
system.
we
simply
say,
"once
you
let
us
on
campus,
just
give
us,
and
extend
to
us,
an
opportunity
to
recruit
on
the
same
terms
as
others.
"
and
that
obviously
reflects
the
commonsense
judgment
that
the
military
is
competing
for
the
same
pool
of
students
that
the
other
employers
are
competing
for.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and,
of
course,
we
take
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--position
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
there's...
i
mean,
there's...
the
constitution
is...
has
no
difficulty
with
such
a
statute.
it
is
this
statute.
as
i
say,
there's...
if
you
want
to
think
about
it
being
preferential
entry
into
campus,
and
then,
at
that
point,
equal
access
on
terms
of
the...
the
terms
that
are
extended...
however
you
want
to
think
about
it,
though,
there's
no
difficult
constitutional
question
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
i'm...
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
got
us
off
on
the
wrong
foot.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
there
is
this
debate--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
a
couple
of
points,
justice
breyer.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
difficult
constitutional
question
to
be
avoided
here,
and
i'll
get
back
to
that
whenever
i
can.
as
to
the
statutory
interpretation
question
itself,
i
think
that
in...
the
proper
frame
of
reference
here
is
probably
not
the
original
1969
version
of
this,
which
conditioned
only
nasa's
fund.
the
original
starting
point
is
probably
about
1996,
when
the
first
version
of
the
modern
solomon
amendment
was
introduced.
and
there
have
been
a
couple
of
iterations
of
it,
but
i
think
one
important
reference
point
is
the
version
that
was
in
force
at
the
start
of
this
litigation,
and
that's
actually
reproduced
at
page
88(a)
of
the
petition
appendix
in
the
district
court
opinion.
and
if
you
look
at
that
against
88(a)
of
the
petition
appendix,
there
would
be
no
question
that
what
is
at
stake
here
is
access
to
the
campus,
and
the
amicus
argument
that's
being
raised
is
not
even
available;
because
the
statute
at
that
point
is,
i
think,
in
fairness,
materially
identical,
except
for
that
last
clause,
which
says
"in
a
manner
equal
in
scope
to...
in
character
to
that
of
any
other
institution.
"
so,
it's
clear
that
when
this
litigation
starts,
there's
no
argument
available
to
the
amicus
that
the
statute
effectively
accomplishes
nothing.
now,
what
happens
under
this
version
of
the
statute
is,
a
second
order
question
arises.
okay,
the...
in
order
to
comply
with
the
solomon
amendment,
universities
have
to
give
access,
they
have
to
allow
the
military
to
gain
entry
and
gain
access
to
the
students
in
the
terms
of
the
then
extant
statute.
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
as
a
regulatory
matter,
the
military
took
the
position
that
if
they
simply
barred
access
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--anybody--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
you
could
read
the
statute
either
way
on
that
question,
justice
stevens.
they
interpreted
it
to
say
that
there
was
no
equal...
there
is
no
obligation
to
give
entry
if
no
employer
was
on
campus
at
that
time.
the
other
thing
they
interpreted
in
the
statute
as
a
regulatory
matter,
though,
was
this
second
order
question
of,
"all
right,
if
they
get
some
access,
is
unequal
access
enough?
"
and
as
a
regulatory
matter,
they
said,
"no.
"
"we
need
access
that
is
equal
in
character
and
scope
to
that
provided
to
any
other
employer.
"
and
then
what
congress
did
in
the
iteration
of
the
statute
that's
at
issue
here,
which
is
reproduced
starting
at
page
185(a)
of
the
petition
appendix
is
they
effectively
codified
and
ratified
that
regulatory
interpretation
by
adding
the
phrase
"in
a
manner
that
is
at
least
as
equal
in
quality
and
scope
to
the
access
to
campuses
and
to
other
students
that
is
to
provide
it
to
any
other
employer.
"
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
why
i
said,
in
response
to
justice
breyer,
that
i
think
that
the
proper
point
to
start
to
focus
on
is
the...
these...
is
the
1994
solomon
amendment.
and,
at
that
point,
there
is
a
question
about
this
policy.
at
that
point,
the
american
association
of
law
schools
does
have
its
recruiting
policies
beginning
in
place,
and
i
think
the
provision
has
been
amended
a
number
of
times
in
the
years
since
1994.
there
have
been
changes
in
the
scope
of
the
funding
that's
covered.
first,
student
aid
funds
were
put
in,
then
they
were
taken
out.
and
then,
this
is
the
most
recent
iteration
of
the
provision.
there's
no
question
that
what's
at
issue
here
is
more
than
just
the
vietnam
era
concerns
about
rotc
presence
on
statute,
because
that's
addressed
in
a
different
subsection
of
the
statute.
that's
addressed
in
10
u.s.c.
983(a).
so
this
provision,
10
90...
10
u.s.c.
983(b)
is
specifically
addressed
at
the
problem
of
access
to
campuses
for
recruiting.
and,
i
think,
especially
when
you
read
the
statute
in
light
of
the
relevant
history
of
the
prior
administrative
interpretation,
and
that
being
codified
and
ratified
by
congress,
it's
very
clear
that
this
phrase
"in
a
manner
that
is
at
least
equal
in
quality
and
scope
to
the
access
provided
to
any
other
employer.
"
is
just
that,
it's
a
regulation
of
the
manner
of
access,
once
access
is
granted.
and
it
addresses
this
difficult
question
of,
if
you
allow
some
entry
and
access
onto
campus,
what
level
of
access
is
sufficient?
and
so,
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
deals
with
the
military.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
statute
is
clearly
supported
under
both
provisions,
under
the
spending
authority
and
the
article
i
authority
to
raise
and
support
armies.
i
think,
in
answering
your
question,
we
tended
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
it
was
a
spending
condition,
because
we
thought,
under
this
court's
precedence,
that
made
it
an
even
more
straightforward
case.
we
certainly
think
it
would
be
constitutional,
even
if
it
were
a
direct
imposition,
and
we
certainly
think
the
fact
that
this
is
an
exercise
of
congress's
undoubted
authority
to
raise
and
support
an
army,
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
analysis.
and
if
i
could
move
over
to
the
constitutional
question
and
address
that
for
a
minute,
i
think
one
of
the
arguments
that's
raised
on
the
other
side
is
that
there's
an
interference
with
associational
interests
in
this
case,
and
i
think
there
are
other
statutes
that,
frankly,
have
much
more
of
an
interference
with
a
university's
associational
interest.
i
mean,
title
vii,
for
example,
regulates
who
can
be
members
of
the
university.
and
i
raise
that
also
because
another
provision
in
title...
in
terms
of
this
same
area
of
the
military,
requires
that
there
not
be
discrimination
against
veterans
in
hiring
and
employment.
and
you
could
easily
see
that
a
university
could
take
their
position
to
its
logical
conclusion
and
say,
"in
order
to
show
just
how
much
we
don't
like
the
military's
policy,
we're
not
only
going
to
not
let
military
recruiters
on
campus,
but
we
are
going
to
not
hire
former
military
people,
veterans,
and
we're
not
going
to
admit
them
to
our
classes.
"
now,
who's
in
the
classroom,
and
who's
a
member
of
the
university--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--seems--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
why
not.
it's
the
same
idea.
in
order
to
teach
equality,
that
there
should
be
no
discrimination
against
homosexuals,
we're
going
to
exclude,
(a),
military
recruiters,
and,
while
we're
at
it,
the
former
military,
as
well,
because
they
voluntarily
joined
the
forces
knowing
that
they
had
a
discriminatory
practice.
it's
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
think
that
the
principle
that's
being
articulated
by
respondents,
would
stretch
well
beyond
simply
a
direct
antidiscrimination
motive.
for
example,
nyu...
this
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
at
page
153...
nyu,
for
3
years,
had
a
policy
of
excluding
recruiters
from
the
state
of
colorado,
simply
because
colorado
had
passed
amendment
ii,
which
this
court
dealt
with
in
the
romer
case.
and
so,
it's
not
a
matter
of
saying
that,
"well,
you
know,
the
only
think
that's
at
issue
here
is
excluding
employers
that
are,
themselves,
discriminatory.
"
the
free
speech
interests
that
are
articulated
on
the
other
side,
would
extend
to
any
basis
for
criticizing
the
military,
whether
it
was
not
liking
the
war
in
iraq,
the
war
in
afghanistan,
or
the
discriminatory
hiring
policies.
i
also
think,
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
discrimination,
it's
worth
pointing
out
here
that
there's
more
than
one
way
to
understand
whether
or
not
the
military's
policy
is
discriminatory.
certainly
respondents
are
entitled
to
view
it
as
being
discriminatory.
but
the
congress
that
mandates
this
same
policy
towards
homosexuals,
i
think,
is
equally
entitled
to
look
at
it
and
say,
"no,
there's
no
discrimination
going
on
here,
because
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
special
role
of
the
military.
"
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
exactly
right
justice
souter,
and
i
think
those
arguments
would
be
the
same
even
if
what
was
going
on
here
was
a
concern
about
the
military's
other
policies.
you
would
still
have
a
concern
that
the
military
is
being
forced
onto
campus
to
make
its
own
speech,
and
you
would
still
have
the
concern
that
that
interferes
with
the
message--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
university--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
agree.
i
mean,
i
think,
ultimately,
that
cuts
in
our
favor,
because
it
shows
that
the
other
side's
position
is
not
limited
to
this
narrow
context,
but
is
a
much
broader
first
amendment
claim.
now,
turning
to
that
first
amendment
claim,
i
think
what's
wrong
with
that
claim
is
several
things.
i
think,
with
respect
to
what
the
military
itself
wants,
it
simply
does
not
want
a...
primarily
a
speech
activity
to
take
place,
it
wants
access
for
recruiting,
which
is
a
traditional
commercial
enterprise,
it
is
an
activity
that
is
something
that
is
regulated
by
title
vii
in
other
federal
statutes.
sure,
there
may
be
some
incidental
speech
involved
in
that,
but
primarily
it
is
an
instrumental
activity
designed
to
get--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
does,
indeed,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think,
though...
i
mean,
there
is
this
sense
in
which
we
certainly
concede
that
there
maybe
some
incidental
speech
involved;
certainly,
the
military
recruiters
are
engaged
in
speech.
i'm...
we're
not
sure
that's
really
the
relevant
speech.
but
even
the
university
itself--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
souter,
i
guess...
i'm
inferring
that
you're
drawing
that
conclusion
from
some
of
the
statements
of
some
of
the
floor
sponsors
about
their
purposes
enacting
the
solomon
amendment.
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
the
test
of
the
act
alone--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
the
reason
for
the
solomon
amendment
is
to
ensure
that
military
recruiters,
in
fact,
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
recruit
the
same
pool
of
individuals
that
all
the
other
employers
are
trying--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
recruit.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
if
by...
"the
expressive
objective"
you're
talking
about
is
the
military's
own
recruiting,
i
guess--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
agree
with
you.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
would
disagree,
justice
souter.
if
the...
if
the
law
schools
were
denying
access
to
military
recruiters,
for
any
reason,
be
it
a
first
amendment
reason
that
they'd
say
it's
a
first
amendment
reason,
or
just
because
they
couldn't
be
bothered,
the
solomon
amendment
would
be
written
exactly
the
same
way,
which
would
say,
"look,
the
military
has
an
opportunity
to
get
onto
campus,
and,
once
it
gets
there,
it
ought
to
get
the
same
basic
opportunities
as
other
employers.
"
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
and
i
would
go
further
and
say
it's
also
not
a
problem,
if,
in
the
real
world,
the
conduct
that
congress
sought
to
regulate
was,
in
fact,
in
practice,
generated
by
first
amendment
concerns.
i
think
that
describes
o'brien.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes,
they
can,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
they
would
be,
in
fairness...
i
want
to
be
clear...
i
think
there
might
be
a
line
where
there
would
be...
the
recruitment
office
could
conduct
itself
in
a
way
that
would
effectively
deny
access.
but
i
think,
with
that
caveat,
there
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--nothing
in
the
act
that
prevents
the
universities--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--from
disclaiming--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
would
say,
to
the...
i
think,
the
main
thrust
of
your
question,
no,
which
is
to
say
that
if
what
you
have
in
mind
is
really
forcing
them
to
go
to
the
undergraduate
campus,
i
think
the
military
would
take
the
position
that
that's
not
equal
in
scope.
now,
if
there's
a
way,
though--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
the
latter,
justice
stevens,
and
only
the
latter--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
my
own--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean--
[laughter]
--i
guess
i'm...
i'm
resisting
a
little
bit
just
because
i'm
not...
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--hypothetical.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
could--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
could
apply
to
some
symbolic
speech,
i
believe.
it's
just...
i'm
having
trouble,
because,
in
a
practical
matter,
if
you
look
at
the
record
here,
i
think
it's
telling.
if
you
look,
at
joint
appendix,
at
pages
215
and
219,
describes
the
real
situation
at
boston
college.
and
they
want
to
say
that,
"well,
it's
not
really
much
of
an
imposition
on
the
military,
because
all
you
have
to
do
is
get
the
recruiting
list
from
the
reserve
desk
at
the
law
library,
and
then
go
to--
"
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
main
campus,
which
is
a
mile
and
a
half
away.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
and
i
think...
i
mean,
i'm...
i
think
that
some
resistance
by
some
parts
of
the
university
might
be
fine.
i
think
if
the
recruiting
office...
this
is
the
caveat
i
tried
to
give
justice
o'connor...
if
the
recruiting
office
engages
in
conduct
that
effectively
negates
the
access
that
they're
providing,
then
i
think
you
would
have
a
different
situation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
mean,
concretely,
they
could
put
signs
on
the
bulletin
board
next
to
the
door,
they
could
engage
in
speech,
they
could
help
organize
student
protests.
i
would
draw
the
line,
though,
at
saying
that
they
have
to
go
to
the
undergraduate
campus,
because
i
think,
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
school
could--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--organize--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that
would
be
equal
access.
i
think
you
have
to
draw
a
practical
line--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--here
between--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--between
access
and
allowing
the
speech,
but
i
think
it...
you
have
to
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
the
military
and
the
army
recruiters...
and
i...
and
i
won't
be
one
of
them...
but
i
think
the
army
recruiters
are
not
worried
about
being
confronted
with
speech,
they're
worried
about
actually
not
being
allowed
onto
the
same
law
schools--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
know
if
it
would
fulfill
every
purpose,
but
i
think
the
amendment
has
to
accommodate
the
first
amendment--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--interests
at--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--a
university.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
that
would--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
but,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
what
the
constitution
would
allow
the
government
to
do
and
what
this
statute
does,
which
is
to
say...
i
mean,
what
you
have
in
mind
is
a--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--race
example--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right,
but
in...
the
practical
meaning
has
to
turn
on
the
statute
at
issue.
and
title
vi,
for
example,
in
the
race
context,
forbids
all
discrimination
because
of
race.
and
so,
some
of
the
conduct
that
you
have
in
mind
may
well
violate
that
statute.
and
if
congress
wants
to
write
a
different
statute
that
provides
more
rights
to
the
military,
we
would
be
here
defending
it
as
valid
first
amendment
legislation.
but
this
statute
gives,
not
a
right
to
be
free
of
any
discrimination,
but
a
right
to
equal
access.
and
we
think
that
the
right
way
to
frame
that
inquiry
is
say,
"access,
yes,
but
be
respectful
of
speech.
"
and
the
last
thing
i
would
say,
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
is
simply
that
it's
worth
remembering
that
the
recruiting
office
is
not
the
heart
of
first
amendment
activity
on
campus.
and
if
the
recruiting
office
acts
in
a
way
that
ensures
access,
and
the
rest
of
the
university
engages
in
speech,
that's
a
commonsense
way
to
accommodate
the
interest
of
the
military
recruiters
and
the
first
amendment.
if
i
may
reserve.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes,
your
honor.
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
at
least...
especially
as
to
the
first
half,
which
links
to
justice
breyer's
earlier
question.
there
is
an
enormous
difference,
under
this
court's
jurisprudence,
between
antidiscrimination
laws
and
the
sort
of
law
we
have
here,
the
solomon
amendment.
and
the
difference
is,
the
government...
it
is
both
on
the
need
side
and
on
the
infringement
side.
on
the
need
side,
the
government
has
a
compelling
interest
that
is
different
from
just
regulating
the
conduct.
the
compelling
interest
that
the
government
has
is
a
completely
separate
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
not
a
penny
of
federal
money
ever
goes
to
support
an
institution
that
taxpayers
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
go
to.
that's
bob
jones
and
norwood.
and,
on
the
infringement
side,
this
court
has
said,
that
the
act
of
discriminating
against
individuals
is
entitled
to
no
first
amendment
protection,
regardless
of
whether
there's
a
first
amendment
right
at
stake.
and
i
should
add,
also,
that
the
vast
majority
of
schools
that
are
subject
to
title
vi
or
to
title
ix
have
no
such
expression
that
is
at
stake.
they
are
not
articulating
a
message,
"we
really
need
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
or
on
the
basis
of
gender.
"
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
make
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
in
starting
with
the
compelled
speech
problem,
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
speech
that
are
at
issue
here.
first,
there
is
the
compelled
speech
of
the
military
recruiters.
and
no
one
thinks
that
that
speech
is
being
misattributed
to
the
schools.
even
in
the
secondary
school
context,
in
mergens,
this
court
understood
that
secondary
students
could
distinguish
between
the
school's
message
and
that
of
school
groups.
now,
the
second
piece
of
speech
that's
at
issue
is
that
of
the
university,
when
they
incidentally
send
an
email
around
telling
the
students
where
the
military
recruiters
are
going
to
be
on
a
certain
day.
and
certainly
in
the
context
of
recruiting,
that
kind
of
incidental
speech
does
not
implicate
any
compelled
speech
doctrine.
in
the
title
vii
context,
for
example,
if
an
employer
says
that
there's
a
job
opening,
and
says
that
to
a
white
applicant,
it
has
to
say
the
same
thing
to
an
african
american
applicant.
nobody
would
think
that
that
other...
saying
that
to
the
african
american
applicant,
which
is,
of
course,
compelled
speech
by
title
vii,
violates
the
constitution.
i
would
also
say,
just
as
the
last
point
on
compelled
speech,
that
it's
something
of
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
in
the
context
of
this
case,
since
we
are
talking
about
a
funding
condition,
not
a
compulsion.
second,
let
me
move
to
the
argument
that
the
respondents
have
about
trying
to
distinguish
this
case
from
justice
stevens'
world
war
ii
hypothetical.
and,
as
i
understand
it,
it
boils
down
to
the
argument
that
the
way
that
the
legislature
was
reacting
here
to
this
problem
and
observing
what
it
observed
on
campus
somehow
implicates
different
constitutional
issues,
different
first
amendment
issues.
and
i
think
the
o'brien
case
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
that
argument.
in
that
case,
if
you
look
at
it,
the
argument
was
exactly
the
same.
there
already
was
a
prohibition
that
required
you
to
have
your
draft
card
with
you.
congress
then
passed
a
second
statute
that
prohibited
burning
your
draft
card.
now,
what
did
the
representatives
say
about
that?
well,
representative
bray,
of
indiana,
said
that
this
was
an
effort
to
get
at
"communist
stooges
and
beatniks".
now,
this
court
did
not
strike
the
statute
down
on
that
basis.
it
looked
at
the
text
of
the
statute
and
upheld
the
statute
as
a
reasonable
statute.
let
me
also,
then,
move
to
what
you
could
call
the
"bob
jones
problem".
and
i
think
you
have
to
have
be
cautious
about
interpreting
this
statute
in
applying
a
rule
and
having
it
come
back
in
the
context
of
other
statutes
that
even
the
law
schools
like,
like
title
vi
and
title
ix.
i
don't
think
it's
enough
to
simply
say
that
race
is
going
to
be
different.
for
one
thing,
federal
statutes
also
prohibit,
as
a
condition
on
funding,
universitywide
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
disability
and
on
the
basis
of
age.
now,
those
aren't
things
that
trigger
heightened
scrutiny,
and
i
think
one
has
to
be
worried
about
converting
this
rule
in
this
case
to
something
that's
going
to
threaten
those
statutes.
this
court,
in
hishon,
for
example,
made
the
point
that
all
discrimination
can
be
recharacterized
as
somebody
simply
saying...
exercising
their
associational
rights,
"i
don't
want
to
associate
with
you,
because
you're
female.
"
in
hishon.
you
have
to
be
leery
of
that
kind
of
recharacterization.
the
last
point
i
would
make
is
that
there's
simply
no
limit
on
respondent's
argument
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
their
matter
of
conscious
limitation
is
going
to
be
enforceable
by
the
courts.
and,
beyond
that,
i
think,
even
in
this
case,
there
is
more
at
issue
here
than
just
the
military's
policy
on
homosexuals.
if
you
look
at
the
original
statement
of
the
american
association
of
law
schools...
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
246
and
249...
they
were
concerned,
first
and
foremost,
about
the
military's
policies
on
homosexuals,
but
also
about
the
discrimination
in
sex,
on
what
kind
of
combat
roles
that
women
could
have,
what
they
call
career
advancing
positions.
so,
even
if
congress
changed
"don't
ask,
don't
tell"
tomorrow,
the...
presumably,
the
law
schools
would
still
be
here
protesting
the
military's
position
on
gender,
or
perhaps
the
war
in
iraq,
or
perhaps
the
war
in
afghanistan.
and
the
last
point
in
showing
there
is
no
limits
on
their
position
is,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
any
conduct
can
be
imbued
with
communicative
force
just
by
saying,
"we're
opposed
to
this,
and,
therefore,
we're
going
to
engage
in
this
conduct.
"
that's
simply
not
enough
to
generate
a
significant
first
amendment
interest.
thank
you.
