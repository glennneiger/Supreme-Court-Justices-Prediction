justice
kennedy
you
also
contend
there
is
no
case
of
controversy
on
that
point,
i
take
it?
justice
kennedy
your
position,
mr.
fried,
then
is
that
griswold
versus
connecticut
is
correct
and
should
be
retained?
justice
kennedy
is
that
because
there
is
a
fundamental
right
involved
in
that
case?
justice
kennedy
does
the
case
stand
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
right
to
determine
whether
to
procreate?
justice
kennedy
what
is
the
right
involved
in
griswold?
justice
kennedy
what
is
the
right
involved
in
griswold?
justice
kennedy
how
do
you
define
the
liberty
interests
of
the
woman
in
that
connection?
justice
kennedy
how
do
you
define
the
interest...
the
liberty
interest
of
a
woman
in
an
abortion
case?
justice
kennedy
i
understand
it
is
matched
but
i
want
to
know
how
you
define
it?
justice
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
the
state
can
forbid
abortions
save
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
mother
after
the
fetus
is,
say,
eight
months
old?
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
health
rights
of
the
mother
are
not
involved?
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother
is
not
involved,
can
the
state
prohibit
an
abortion
after
the
fetus
is
eight
months
old?
justice
kennedy
but
that
is
a
line
drawing,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
are
those
first
three
options
ones
on
which
reasonable
people
could
disagree?
justice
kennedy
do
you
have
any
authority
in
our
jurisprudence
other
than
the
cases
following
from
roe
versus
wade
that
tells
a
state
it
cannot
adopt
a
proposition
that
reasonable
people
agree
with?
justice
kennedy
so
this
is
unique
to
roe?
