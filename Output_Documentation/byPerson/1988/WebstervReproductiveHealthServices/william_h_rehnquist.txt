we
will
hear
argument
now
in
no.
88-605,
william
l.
webster
versus
reproductive
health
services.
general
webster.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
webster.
mr.
fried?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
fried.
mr.
susman?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
is
a
deeply
rooted
tradition,
but
surely
abortion
was
regulated
by
the
states
in
the
19th
century
and
in
the
20th
century?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
say
there
is
a
deeply
rooted
tradition
of
freedom
in
this
area,
that
suggests
that
there
had
been
no
legislative
intervention
to
me.
what
you
are...
that
simply
is
not
the
fact.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
am
not
talking
about
legislation
post-roe
against
wade.
i
am
talking
about
legislative
regulation
of
abortion
in
the
19th
century
and
the
20th
century
before
roe
against
wade.
you
may
be
right
that
that
is
unconstitutional
under
roe
against
wade
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
argue
that
there
was
a
deeply-rooted
tradition
of
no
regulation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
there
are
no
criminal
sanctions,
why
does
vagueness
apply?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
authority
from
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
case
authority?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
they
cite
a
case
from
this
court
for
that
proposition?
well,
go
on.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
susman.
general
webster,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
webster.
the
case
is
submitted.
