mr.
william
l.
webster
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
represents
a
direct
appeal
that
involves
a
1986
missouri
statute
defining
the
rights
of
the
unborn
and
regulating
abortion
in
missouri.
missouri's
appeal
involves
three
basic
areas
for
this
court's
review:
the
first,
the
constitutional
boundaries
on
the
limitations
of
public
funding;
the
second,
the
effect
of
and
the
facial
constitutionality
of
legislation
declaring
that
life
begins
at
conception;
and,
third,
the
ability
of
a
state
to
require
a
physician
to
perform
tests
and
to
make
and
record
findings
when
determining
viability.
finally,
we
have
asked
this
court
to
reconsider
the
standard
of
review
to
be
applied
to
state
abortion
regulation.
since
1973
this
court
has
reaffirmed
roe
versus
wade's
mandate,
state
and
lower
federal
courts
have
repeatedly
interpreted
that
mandate,
frequently
strictly
against
the
states.
one
result
is
that
the
states
have
effectively
been
forbidden,
not
only
to
prohibit
abortion
but
usually
to
regulate
abortion
in
any
significant
way.
we
would
begin
with
the
public
funding
area
where
the
eighth
circuit
upheld
that
portion
of
missouri's
law
which
declared
unlawful
the
expenditure
of
public
funds
for
the
purpose
of
performing
or
assisting
in
an
abortion
but
struck
down
three
subsequent
sections.
the
court
declared
first
of
all
section
188.205
relating
to
the
expenditure
of
public
funds
for
abortion
advocacy,
facially
unconstitutional.
we
would
contend
to
the
court
as
we
have
at
every
level
that
this
particular
section,
which
we
have
appealed,
does
not
go
to
the
speech
but
rather
is
directed
at
the
entities
responsible
for
expending
public
funds.
mr.
william
l.
webster
there
were
three
sections.
mr.
william
l.
webster
yes.
we
have
suggested
throughout
that
this
language
is
directed
towards
those
individuals
responsible
for
the
expenditure
of
public
funds,
that
it
is
not
directed
to
any
physician
or
any
health
care
provider.
we
would
note
that
much
of
appellees
brief
treats
it
as
if
the
subsequent
two
sections
are
still
before
the
court
dealing
with
public
employees
and
other
health
care
providers
and
speech
in
public
facilities.
but
that's
not
what
we
have
brought
here.
we
contend
the
government
is
certainly
not
obligated
in
and
of
itself
to
become
an
advocate
for
abortion.
this
court
was
very
explicit
in
meyer
when
it
concluded
that
a
state
is
not
required
to
show
a
compelling
interest
for
its
policy
choice
to
favor
child
birth,
normal
child
birth
over
advocacy
of
abortion.
mr.
william
l.
webster
there
are
two
provisions
in
the
speech
area
that
are
not
before
this
court.
one
dealt
with
the
speech
of
public
employees
and
the
other
the
speech
in
public
facilities.
the
only
issue
that
remains--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--we
have
not
challenged
those.
we
have
not
brought
those
before
this
court.
we
also
deal
with
the
question
of
public
funding
in
hospitals
and
the
use
of
public
employees.
we
contend
here
that
the
eighth
circuit
struck
down
missouri's
prohibition
of
the
use
of
public
facilities
and
public
employees
improperly.
we
suggest
that
they
ignored
the
language
of
this
court
in
poelker
and
maher.
these
statutes
that
the
state
is
defending
are
clearly
within
the
authority
recognized
by
the
abortion
funding
decisions
of
this
court
and
especially
by
poelker.
the
lower
court
chose
to
rely
on
its
own
precedent
of
nyberg
versus
city
of
virginia.
we
contend
that
that
is
clearly
wrong.
in
essence,
the
court
in
nyberg
has
contorted
roe
to
create
an
abortion
right
in
public
hospitals,
requiring
those
public
facilities
to
provide
abortions
if,
in
fact,
the
patient
has
the
capacity
to
pay.
and
it
seems
to
us
a
convoluted
result
to
suggest
that
if
you
can
afford
an
abortion,
we
have
to
provide
one
for
you
in
a
public
facility
but
if
you
lack
the
financial
capacity
to
provide
an
abortion,
that
the
state
and
other
public
governmental
entities
are
not
obligated
to
provide
those
services
for
you.
mr.
william
l.
webster
we
have
a
separate
specific
statute
in
missouri
which
prohibits
abortions
which
occur
at
viability.
any
post-viability
abortion
would
be
prohibited
under
missouri
statute.
mr.
william
l.
webster
to
my
knowledge
there
is
no
sanction
for
violation.
mr.
william
l.
webster
the
language
here
is
directed
towards
those
bodies
that
expend
the
public
funds.
mr.
william
l.
webster
public
funds
whether
it's
related
to
encouraging
or
counseling
or
the
expenditure
of
public
funds
for
the
performance
of
abortion.
i
would
presume
that
the
remedy
would
be
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
either
the
facilities
from
performing
those
services
or
to
prohibit
the
expenditure
of
the
funds
themselves
to
be
appropriated
to
that
facility.
mr.
william
l.
webster
this
particular
chapter,
188,
carries
a
general
class
a
misdemeanor
penalty
for
violations
of
the
initial
sections,
but
there
is
no
operative
language
in
the
1986
statute.
mr.
william
l.
webster
arguably
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
william
l.
webster
my
opinion
is
that
there
is
no
language
in
that
section
which
was
adopted
here
which
would
suggest
that
it
would
make
it
a
criminal
offense,
only
that
it
is
directed
to
those
bodies
expending
the
public
funds
themselves.
mr.
william
l.
webster
we
wouldn't
view
that
violation
as
a
misdemeanor,
no.
mr.
william
l.
webster
that
is
the
only
enforcement
power
that
we
would
presume
contained
in
the
language
which
was
enacted
in
the
1986
statute.
mr.
william
l.
webster
it
is
conceivable
the
hospital
board
could
if
somebody
violated
the
policy
of
that
facility,
seek
to
discharge
that
particular
employee.
we
don't--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--we
would
presume
that
would
be
an
opportunity
available.
mr.
william
l.
webster
that
certainly
would
be
one
of
the
appropriate
remedies.
but
the
directives
here
go
to
those
bodies
that
are
responsible
for
the
expenditure
of
the
funds
themselves
and
merely
say
as
a
matter
of
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
missouri
that
we
are
not
going
to
appropriate
those
funds
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging,
counseling,
performing
and
assisting
or
in
this
case
the
use
of
public
facilities.
we
believe
that
the
result
of
nyberg
is
contrary
to
the
precedent
of
this
court
in
both
poelker
and
maher
and
also
in
harris
where
it
has
been
suggested
that
governmental
bodies
do
not
have
to
appropriate
their
funds
in
that
manner.
the
court
has
also,
the
lower
court
has
also,
challenged
what
we
contend
to
be
a
preamble
of
this
particular
statute,
a
declaration
that
life
begins
at
conception
which
is
found
in
section
1.205.1.
the
district
court
held
this
preamble
was
in
conflict
with
the
essence
of
roe.
we
believe
this
is
clearly
wrong.
the
district
court
also
relied
on
language
in
akron
which
suggested
a
state
cannot
adopt
one
theory
of
life,
at
least
when
life
begins,
for
the
purpose
of
justifying
its
regulation
of
abortion.
we
have
suggested
from
the
outset
in
this
case
that
these
findings
are
part
of
the
statutory
preamble
and
do
not
serve
as
any
substantive
right.
they
impose
no
substantive
responsibility.
and
i
believe
it
is
worth
noting
that
there
were
a
number
of
sections
in
this
chapter
that
were
also
enacted
in
1986
which
have
not
been
challenged,
that
affect
tort
law,
affect
the
criminal
law.
the
one
area
we
contend
they
do
not
affect
is
the
regulation
of
abortion.
there
is
specific
language
which
suggests
that
abortion
conduct
would
be
exempt
because
this
exempts
from
the
ambit
of
the
preamble
any
area
that
has
been
declared
subject
to
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
decisional
law
and
the
missouri
constitution.
the
operative
sections
which
do
have
effect
remain
unchallenged
by
the
appellees,
but
the
findings
have
been
struck
down.
states
have
historically
undertaken
legislative
action
in
non-abortion
related
areas
without
violating
anyone's
constitutional
rights
for
as
long
as
we
have
had
a
constitution.
the
statute
does
not
in
any
way
affect
a
woman's
constitutional
right
to
choose
abortion
over
child
birth.
the
statute
does
specifically
exclude
abortion
and
the
court
seems
to
be
attempting
here
to
try
and
divine
what
the
legislators'
motivations
might
have
been
with
language
which
we
contend
has
no
operative
effect.
the
eighth
circuit
has
invalidated
an
abstract,
philosophical
statement
of
the
legislature
because
apparently
they
don't
agree
with
it
and
that
seems
to
be
the
type
of
direction
that
we
are
seeing
in
a
number
of
the
lower
courts.
we
contend
this
declaration
doesn't
affect
anyone,
that
it
was
clearly
improperly
struck
down
at
the
lower
court
level
and
that
legislative
bodies
around
this
country
should
be
entitled
at
least
in
the
non-abortion
area
to
have
a
philosophical
statement
of
when
they
contend
life
begins.
mr.
william
l.
webster
we
have
raised
that
issue
at
every
level,
your
honor.
there
is
also
a
provision
of
the
statute
that
was
struck
down
which
deals
with
the
requirements
to
conduct
tests
to
make
findings
to
determine
viability.
the
district
court
upheld
the
first
sentence
of
section
188.029
which
requires
a
doctor
before
performing
an
abortion,
if
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
that
woman
is
carrying
an
unborn
child
that
has
reached
20
weeks
or
more
of
gestational
age,
to
first
determine
if
that
child
is
viable.
that
language
has
not
been
appealed.
that
is
the
standard
which
is
articulated
here.
the
physician,
if
they
think
the
child
is
viable,
think
the
child
has
reached
20
weeks
of
gestational
age,
will
make
a
determination
of
viability.
the
district
court,
however,
then
severed
the
second
sentence
of
188.029
relying
on
dictum
from
this
court
found
in
colautti
and
on
that
basis
they
said
the
legislatures
of
this
country
cannot
proclaim
any
single
factor
as
a
measure
of
viability.
we
have
said
at
the
outset
under
roe
that
missouri
and
every
other
state
has
an
important
and
legitimate
interest
in
the
fetus
throughout
pregnancy.
and
even
adopting
the
roe
standard,
certainly
that
interest
becomes
compelling
at
viability.
this
court
has
said
so.
we
contend
the
states
should
be
permitted
to
protect
viable
unborn
children
by
requiring
physicians
in
their
best
medical
judgment
to
undertake
such
tests
as
are
necessary
to
provide
findings
of
gestational
age
and
weight.
the
lower
court's
result
would
make
this
obligation
of
the
state
to
protect
that
viable
fetus
frankly
mere
verbiage.
if
the
state
cannot
be
required
to
make
and
record
findings
in
the
process
of
determining
if
a
child
is
viable,
then,
frankly,
they
have
very
little
opportunity
to
determine
whether
viability
has
actually
been
found.
there
are
two
other
points
we
want
to
make
here--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--there
are
three
facts.
mr.
william
l.
webster
your
honor,
there
are
three
factors
and
lung
maturity
is
one
of
them:
gestational
age,
fetal
weight
and
lung
maturity.
but
as
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
and
to
the
lower
court,
we
feel
there
are
two
distinguishing
characteristics
that
separate
this
from
colautti.
the
first
is
that
this
imposes
on
physicians
a
standard
of
care.
it
says
they
are
supposed
to
use
the
ordinary
care,
degree
of
care,
skill
and
proficiency
commonly
exercised
by
skillful,
careful
and
prudent
physicians
under
same
or
similar
circumstances,
and
to
the
extent
a
particular
test
would
be
inappropriate,
it
would
not
comply
with
that
standard
of
care.
we
also
suggest
in
the
language
that
they
are
only
supposed
to
perform
such
tests
as
are
necessary
to
make
findings
of
gestational
age,
weight
and
fetal
lung
maturity,
and
to
the
extent
a
test
would
not
be
necessary,
to
the
extent
it
would
show
nothing,
and
we
have
conceded
at
20
weeks
amniocentesis
would
not
be
appropriate,
it
would
clearly
not
be
a
necessary
test.
mr.
william
l.
webster
we
believe,
we
believe
it
clearly
is
a
common
sense
reading
of
this,
a
common
sense
construction,
to
say
that
if
a
test
would
not
demonstrate
anything,
it
would
not
be
in
the
normal
standard
of
care
which
this
statute
in
the
section
which
remains
upheld
imposes
on
that
physician.
we
are
not
suggesting
which
test
they
use,
first
of
all.
we
are
merely
suggesting
that
they
make
and
record
findings.
and
to
the
extent
one
test
can
make
determinations
for
the
first
two
areas,
gestational
age
and
fetal
weight,
and
we
believe
the
uncontroverted
record
below
is
that
ultrasound
after
20
weeks
can
benefit
in
making
such
findings,
that
at
least
those
two
findings
are
relevant
and
should
be
upheld.
we
are
really
not
at
the
point
to
concede
fetal
weight
because
we
believe
the
language
does
distinguish
for
those
tests
that
are
necessary.
mr.
william
l.
webster
we
are
contending,
your
honor,
that
if
that
test
would
not
be
dispositive,
if
it
wouldn't
tell
them
anything
by
definition,
it
cannot
be
a
necessary
test.
mr.
william
l.
webster
we
have
only--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--we
believe
these
are
three
relevant
objective
medical
findings
that
should
be
recorded.
mr.
william
l.
webster
well,
this
statute
would
require
them
to
make
findings,
not
necessarily
record
tests
but
make
findings,
and
the
language
in
the
lower
court--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--the
language
of
the
lower
court
in
the
testimony--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--my
view,
first
of
all,
is
that
the
ultrasound
technology
which
was
discussed
at
the
lower
court
can
make
a
finding
for
both
gestational
age
and
fetal
weight.
mr.
william
l.
webster
no.
mr.
william
l.
webster
i
don't
believe
that
it
requires
an
unnecessary
test.
to
the
extent
they
can
determine
that
a
fetus
is
viable
with
the
first
finding,
i
don't
think
their
ordinary
skill
would
require
them
to
go
beyond
that.
if
they
made
the
determination
that
at
that
point
the
fetus
is
viable,
i
don't
believe
they
need
to
go
beyond
that.
mr.
william
l.
webster
then
i
believe
it
would
be
appropriate,
given
the
state--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--i
believe
the
statute
would
require
them
to
go
forward.
mr.
william
l.
webster
at
least
with
the
next
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
fetus
is
viable,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
webster
if
the
first
two
tests
don't
indicate
viability,
they
would
need
to,
and
if
there
was
some
indication--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--only
if
in
his
ordinary
skill
and
care
he
has--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--i
don't
believe
the
statute
requires
the
physician
to
perform
any
tests
that
would
be
unnecessary.
we
would
finally
suggest
in
this
area
that
if
roe
is
the
standard
that
is
to
be
applied
to
the
states,
and
if
the
dependence...
viability
is
going
to
be
that
bright
line
that
states
are
supposed
to
depend
on,
then
at
a
minimum
we
believe
states
should
have
a
right
to
ensure
a
reasonable
effort
to
determine
viability
and
in
this
area
we
are
not
telling
the
physician
what
kind
of
test
to
require,
we
are
not
even
requiring
him
to
use
these
tests
and
have
them
to
be
determinative
of
viability.
we
are
merely
requiring
that
a
physician,
usually
a
pro-abortion
physician,
make
findings
and
record
them.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
william
l.
webster
turning
first
to
your
question,
your
honor,
we
have
suggested
all
along
that
the
language
relating
to
funding
only
directs
and
only
goes
to
those
officers
of
public
funding.
to
the
extent
you
have
an
employee
that
goes
outside
the
boundaries
of
a
program,
whether
it
is
this
particular
program
or
any
other
governmental
program,
i
am
presuming
that
they
would
be
subject
to
the
disciplinary
actions
that
they
could
take
against
any
public
employee.
my
colleague
raises
three
or
four
issues
that
i
would
like
to
briefly
touch
on.
first
of
all,
he
discusses
at
length
the
issue
of
contraception
and
while
it
raises
interesting
questions,
we
do
not
believe
those
are
questions
that
are
found
in
this
particular
case.
the
preamble
does
not
cover
abortion.
this
court
has
historically
viewed
contraception
on
a
somewhat
different
standard.
the
separate
statutory
provision
in
this
case--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--your
honor,
and
it
may
well
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
review
that
question
at
some
point.
but
we
are
suggesting
that
it
is
not
before
the
court
with
this
particular
preamble,
that
it
would
take
a
separate
statutory
enactment
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
missouri
to
do
that.
right
now
the
only
language
we
have
dealing
with
the
prohibition
of
abortions
as
a
procedure
deal
with
post-viability
abortions.
mr.
william
l.
webster
we
think
overruling
roe
versus
wade
and
going
to
a
different
standard,
whether
it
is
a
rational
basis
standard,
an
undue
burden
standard,
would
not
affect
contraception
or
that
threshold
question
in
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
william
l.
webster
your
honor,
we
would
contend
that
is
not
the
case.
we
believe
it
would
take
an
additional
specific
statutory
enactment
by
the
missouri
general
assembly
to
do
that.
the
only
language
we
have
now
found
in
chapter
188
is
silent
as
to
abortions
before
viability
and
we
certainly
wouldn't
construe
that
the
preamble
alone--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--your
honor,
yes,
there
is
a
specific
statute
and
it
only
prohibits
abortions
in
a
post-viability
setting.
mr.
william
l.
webster
as
far
as
public--
mr.
william
l.
webster
--as
far
as
public
funding
is
concerned.
