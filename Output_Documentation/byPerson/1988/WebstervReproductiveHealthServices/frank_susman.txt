mr.
frank
susman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
the
solicitor
general's
submission
is
somewhat
disingenuous
when
he
suggests
to
this
court
that
he
does
not
seek
to
unravel
the
whole
cloth
of
procreational
rights,
but
merely
to
pull
a
thread.
it
has
always
been
my
personal
experience
that
when
i
pull
a
thread,
my
sleeve
falls
off.
there
is
no
stopping.
it
is
not
a
thread
he
is
after.
it
is
the
full
range
of
procreational
rights
and
choices
that
constitute
the
fundamental
right
that
has
been
recognized
by
this
court.
for
better
or
for
worse,
there
no
longer
exists
any
bright
line
between
the
fundamental
right
that
was
established
in
griswold
and
the
fundamental
right
of
abortion
that
was
established
in
roe.
these
two
rights,
because
of
advances
in
medicine
and
science,
now
overlap.
they
coalesce
and
merge
and
they
are
not
distinct.
mr.
frank
susman
i
do
not
find
it
difficult--
mr.
frank
susman
--if
i
may
suggest
the
reasons
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
scalia.
the
most
common
forms
of
what
we
generically
in
common
parlance
call
contraception
today,
iuds,
low
dose
birth
control
pills
which
are
the
safest
type
of
birth
control
pills
available,
act
as
abortifacients.
they
are
correctly
labeled
as
both.
under
this
statute,
which
defines
fertilization
as
the
point
of
beginning,
those
forms
of
contraception
are
also
abortifacients.
science
and
medicine
refers
to
them
as
both.
we
are
not
still
dealing
with
the
common
barrier
methods
of
griswold.
we
are
no
longer
just
talking
about
condoms
and
diaphragms.
things
have
changed.
the
bright
line,
if
there
ever
was
one,
has
now
been
extinguished.
that's
why
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
we
need
to
deal
with
one
right,
the
right
to
procreate.
we
are
no
longer
talking
about
two
rights.
mr.
frank
susman
if
i
understand
the
question,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
health
rights
of
the
woman
always
are
supreme
at
any
stage
of
pregnancy.
mr.
frank
susman
yes,
i
am
willing
to
recognize
the
compelling
interest
granted
in
roe
of
the
state
in
potential
fetal
life
after
the
point
of
viability.
mr.
frank
susman
yes,
it
is.
but
that
is
a
line
that
is
more
easily
drawn.
i
think
there
are
many
cogent
reasons
for
picking
the
point
of
viability
which
is
what
we
have
today
under
roe.
first
of
all,
historically
both
at
common
law
and
in
early
statutes,
this
was
always
the
line
chosen.
whether
it
was
called
quickening
or
viability,
there
is
little
difference
time-wise.
mr.
frank
susman
technically
between
those
two
definitions,
justice
o'connor,
yes.
quickening
had
less
of
a
medical
significance.
it
was
the
woman
could
first
detect
movement.
mr.
frank
susman
a
kick,
yes,
absolutely,
approximately
two
or
three
weeks
before
what
we
would
consider
viability
today.
the
second
good
reason,
i
think,
for
remaining
with
viability
as
our
dividing
line
in
this
context,
justice
kennedy
is
that
it
is
one
that
the
physician
can
determine
on
a
case-by-case
basis
without
periodic
recourse
to
the
courts.
thirdly,
it
is
a
point
in
time
that
the
physician
can
determine
with
or
without
the
assistance
of
the
woman.
it
is
a
medical
judgment,
i
agree,
and
not
a
medical
fact.
one
cannot
pinpoint
viability
to
a
day
or
to
an
hour
or
to
a
second.
i
would
suggest
again,
as
i
indicated,
that,
the
line
has
now
been
erased.
it
is
interesting
also
to
note
at
the
same
time
that
the
definition
of
conception
or
fertilization
chosen
by
this
statute
does
not
even
comport
with
the
medical
definition.
the
definition
of
conception
promulgated,
for
example,
by
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists,
starts
a
week
later
than
the
definition
that
this
section
has
chosen
to
use.
it
is
at
all
stages
of
procreation,
whether
before
or
after
conception,
that
the
standards
of
what
constitute
fundamental
liberty
are
amply
satisfied.
procreational
interests
are,
indeed,
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
and
neither
liberty
nor
justice
would
exist
without
them.
it
is
truly
a
liberty
whose
exercise
is
deeply
rooted
in
this
nation's
history
and
tradition.
i
think
it
is
somewhat
ironic
that
the
sole
historical
source
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
in
an
effort
to
dispute
this
fact
is
a
work
by
mr.
james
mohr,
"abortion
in
america".
and
yet
mr.
mohr,
along
with
280
other
eminent
historians
in
this
country
have
filed
a
brief
supporting
the
position
of
the
appellees
when
it
comes
to
the
historical
history.
30
percent
of
pregnancies
in
this
country
today
terminate
in
abortion.
it
is
a
high
rate.
it
is
a
rate
that
sometimes
astounds
people,
but
it
is
a
rate
that
has
not
changed
one
whit
from
the
time
the
constitution
was
enacted
through
the
1800's
and
through
the
1900's.
that
has
always
been
the
rate.
it
is
significantly
less
than
the
world-wide
rate.
worldwide,
40
percent
of
all
pregnancies
terminate
in
abortion.
abortion
today
is
the
most
common
surgical
procedure
in
the
united
states
with
the
possible
exception
of
contraception.
it
remains
today,
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
roe
17
times
safer
than
childbirth,
100
times
safer
than
appendectomy,
a
safe
procedure,
minor
surgery.
i
suggest
that
there
can
be
no
ordered
liberty
for
women
without
control
over
their
education,
their
employment,
their
health,
their
childbearing
and
their
personal
aspirations.
there
does,
in
fact,
exist
a
deeply
rooted
tradition
that
the
government
steer
clear
of
decisions
affecting
the
bedroom,
childbearing
and
the
doctor-patient
relationship
as
it
pertains
to
these
concerns.
mr.
frank
susman
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
and
examine,
as
the
historical
brief
does
and
other
works,
as
to
the
reasons
those
regulations
were
enacted.
similarly,
they
were
not
done
to
protect
the
fetus.
those
were
not
the
purposes.
if
you
look,
for
example--
mr.
frank
susman
--i
think
we
can
look
to
a
deeply
rooted
tradition
as
opposed
to
black
and
white
issues,
as
opposed
to
slavery
and
yet
we
have
much
legislation.
in
fact,
following
this
court's
opinion
in
brown
in
1954,
almost
every
southern
state
without
exception
passed
legislation
directly
in
conflict
with
that
opinion.
so
the
fact
that
legislation
has
been
enacted
does
not
in
my
mind--
mr.
frank
susman
--because
i
think
you
have
to
examine
the
period
before
the
regulations
came
into
effect.
every
state
adopted
anti-abortion
legislation
in
the
1820's
and
the
1830's
and
the
1840's.
but
before
that
time
it
went
without
regulation.
it
was
accepted,
it
was
not
a
crime
at
common
law,
as
roe
and
other
works
have
recognized.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think--
mr.
frank
susman
--i
understand
there
are
briefs
on
both
sides.
but
when
one
tries
to
compare
the
large
number,
as
we
are
all
aware,
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
examine
as
to
whether
or
not
these
briefs
are
filed
by
organizations
whose
primary
purpose
is
to
be
opposed
to
abortion
or
they
are
filed
by
organizations
which
have
been
around
for
100
years
which
we
consider
to
be
reputable
on
a
large
number
of
issues.
i
can't
personally,
for
example...
there
is
disagreement
on
medical
issues
in
this
case
clearly.
i
personally
cannot
put
as
much
stock
in
a
brief
by
wyoming
nurses
for
life
as
i
can
in
briefs
by
the
ama
and
acog,
the
american
public
health
association,
american
public
hospital
association
and
other
organizations
of
similar
vein.
mr.
frank
susman
justice
scalia,
i
would
not
submit
that
the
briefs
do
not
disagree
with
each
other.
i
do
not
dispute
that.
you
or
i
or
others
might
dispute
as
to
whether
the
facts
disagree,
but
the
fact
that
different
parties
put
different
slants
or
different
perspectives
or
interpretations
on
those
facts
certainly,
i
could
not
disagree
with.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
the
basic
question,
and
of
course
it
goes
to
one
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
statute
as
to
whether
this
is
a
human
life
or
whether
human
life
begins
at
conception,
is
not
something
that
is
verifiable
as
a
fact.
it
is
a
question
verifiable
only
by
reliance
upon
faith.
it
is
a
question
of
labels.
neither
side
in
this
issue
and
debate
would
ever
disagree
on
the
physiological
facts.
both
sides
would
agree
as
to
when
a
heartbeat
can
first
be
detected.
both
sides
would
agree
as
to
when
brain
waves
can
be
first
detected.
but
when
you
come
to
try
to
place
the
emotional
labels
on
what
you
call
that
collection
of
physiological
facts,
that
is
where
people
part
company.
mr.
frank
susman
the
conclusion
to
which
it
leads
me
is
that
when
you
have
an
issue
that
is
so
divisive
and
so
emotional
and
so
personal
and
so
intimate,
that
it
must
be
left
as
a
fundamental
right
to
the
individual
to
make
that
choice
under
her
then
attendant
circumstances,
her
religious
beliefs,
her
moral
beliefs
and
in
consultation
with
her
physician.
the
very
debate
that
went
on
outside
this
morning
outside
this
building
and
has
gone
on
in
various
towns
and
communities
across
our
nation,
is
the
same
debate
that
every
woman
who
becomes
pregnant
and
doesn't
wish
to
be
pregnant
has
with
herself.
women
do
not
make
these
decisions
lightly.
they
agonize
over
them.
and
they
take
what
we
see
out
front
and
what
we
see
in
the
media
and
they
personalize
it
and
they
go
through
it
themselves
and
the
very
fact
that
it
is
so
contested
is
one
of
those
things
that
makes
me
believe
that
it
must
remain
as
a
fundamental
right
with
the
individual
and
that
the
state
legislatures
have
no
business
invading
this
decision.
let
me
address
particular
sections,
if
i
may,
for
a
moment.
i
would
start
with
the
public
funding
question.
i
think
the
difficulty
with
the
attorney
general's
argument
in
this
case
is
a
question
of
how
you
interpret
the
provision.
i
would
remind
the
court
that
both
lower
courts
interpreted
this
provision
to
cover
the
speech
aspects
between
the
physician
and
the
woman.
and
if
the
court
accords
to
those
lower
courts
the
due
deference
under
frisby
that
is
due,
then
that
would
be
the
interpretation.
the
language
is
identical
in
205
as
it
is
in
210
and
as
it
is
in
215.
there
is
no
difference.
and
yet
the
attorney
general
would
suggest
to
you
that
it
does
not
mean
what
it
says
and
what
it
says
is:
"no
public
funds
shall
be
expended
for
the
purpose
of
counseling
or
encouraging.
"
it
does
not
say,
as
the
attorney
general
suggests,
that
no
public
funds
shall
be
appropriated
for
a
program
specifically
designed
to
encourage
or
counsel
to
have
an
abortion.
this
is
not
the
first
time
in
the
last
24
hours
that
we
have
heard
persons
from
the
missouri
attorney
general's
office
suggest
interpretations
of
statutory
or
constitutional
language
that
is
not
there
on
the
clear
face
with
the
literal
reading
of
the
english
words
used.
mr.
frank
susman
no.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
any
statute
is
always
subject
to
a
narrowing
construction
depending
how
far
one
wants
to
perhaps
distort
the
language
that
is
there.
yes,
i
don't
think
i
have
ever
seen
a
statute
that
i
couldn't
agree
with,
that
it
might
be
subject
to
narrowing
construction.
the
question
then,
the
test
that
comes
into
play
is
whether
or
not
that
is
so
obvious
or
the
language
is
so
clear
that
no
lower
court,
state
or
federal,
could
reasonably
arrive
at
that
kind
of
construction
and
i
believe
that
that's
what
you
have
here.
i
mean,
certainly
the
lower
courts...
and
again,
that's
the
purpose
of
this
court,
to
review
those
decisions.
but
neither
lower
court
had
the
slightest
problem
with
interpreting
the
plain
language.
mr.
frank
susman
i
absolutely
agree
with
that
principle,
but
then
what
you
always
have
is
just
how
far
do
you
bend
over
backwards
to
accommodate
that
principle?
again,
lawyers
are
capable
of
interpreting
any
set
of
words
in
different
words,
often
more
ways
than
there
are
lawyers
interpreting
them.
mr.
frank
susman
no
public
funds
shall
be
expended.
mr.
frank
susman
i
have
to
assume
and
in
my
opinion
because
certainly
the
answer
is
not
clear,
that
it
is
to
everyone
associated,
every
public
official,
every
public
facility,
who
in
any
way
handles
and
deals
with
public
funds.
and,
of
course,
the
definition
of
public
funds,
as
the
court
is
aware,
is
extremely
broad.
it
even
includes
federal
funds
that
come
into
the
state
treasury.
mr.
frank
susman
absolutely
in
my
opinion.
mr.
frank
susman
right.
but
before
we
touch
upon
this
issue
and
where
we
are
sort
of
hedging
here
is
involving
the
free
speech
aspects
which
have
been
suggested
in
the
various
briefs.
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
that
hurdle
until
one
surmounts
the
obstacle
of
the
fact
that
the
language
is
vague.
and
both
lower
courts
also
found--
mr.
frank
susman
--yes,
because
i
think
justice
kennedy
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
clearly
in
my
mind,
that
were
a
physician
to
violate
the
proscription
of
this
section
and
being
a
publicly
paid
employee,
he
would
necessarily
be
discharged.
mr.
frank
susman
if
his
interpretation
is
correct,
then
i
think
it
remains
almost
a
total
mystery
as
to
what
this
section
does
mean
or
how
it
will
be
applied.
mr.
frank
susman
i
would
agree,
but
when
i
read
the
section
and
i
read
the
two
that
follow,
that's
not
what
it
says
to
me.
but
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
a
different
question.
mr.
frank
susman
absolutely.
mr.
frank
susman
i
agree
100
percent.
and
that's
once...
if
we
outcome
and
do
not
affirm
this,
the
lower
court's
opinions
on
vagueness,
we
are
directly--
mr.
frank
susman
--i
think
it
applies
for
two
reasons.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
the
fact
that
there
is
a
heightened
standard
because
it
touches
upon--
mr.
frank
susman
--in
all
candor,
i
am
having
a
block.
i
will
try
to
come
back
to
it.
but
i
think
the
fact
that--
mr.
frank
susman
--i
understand
that
and
i
apologize.
[laughter]
the
eighth
circuit
talks
in
terms
of
a
heightened
scrutiny
because
it
touches
upon
two
things.
it
touches
upon
the
free
speech
aspects
of
both
the
physician
and
the
patient
and,
secondly,
it
clearly
touches
upon
the
second
fundamental
right
in
addition
to
speech,
of
abortion.
and
on
the
basis
of
those
two
connections,
they
felt
that
heightened
scrutiny
was
appropriate.
mr.
frank
susman
if
i
may.
the
appellees
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
states
are
not
free
to
constrict
the
spectrum
of
available
knowledge
at
the
expense
of
women's
health,
that
this
section
on
its
plain
face
prohibits
physicians
and
other
health
care
providers
from
giving
advice
concerning
abortion.
and
there
was
ample
testimony
at
trial
contained
in
the
record
and
referred
to
in
the
brief
that
physicians
are
frequently
put
in
the
position
of
having
to
affirmatively
advocate
and
recommend
termination
of
pregnancy.
that
women
come
with
conditions
that
are
frequently
less
than
immediately
life
threatening...
diabetes,
renal
failure,
cardiovascular
problems,
a
whole
host
of
conditions
and
they
come
pregnant.
and
the
physician
would
normally
explain
the
options.
and
then
the
doctors
testified
at
trial,
particularly
dr.
pearman
who
is
a
publicly
paid
employee
and
he
said:
and
then
they
turn
to
me
next
and
they
say
to
me:
doctor,
what
would
you
do?
what
is
best
for
me?
and
he
said:
without
reservation
in
those
circumstances,
and
when
he
thinks
it
is
appropriate,
he
openly
recommends
and
advocates
that
they
terminate
their
pregnancy.
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
the
very
kind
of
language
that
is
prohibited
here,
that
the
state
has
chosen
to
say
there
are
certain
subjects
you
can't
talk
about.
this
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
receiving
half
a
loaf
of
medical
information
may
be
much
more
deadly
than
none,
half
advice.
the
parade
of
horribles--
mr.
frank
susman
--i--
mr.
frank
susman
--i
think
the
suggestion
that
the
physician
say
to
the
woman
who
has
been
coming
to
years
to
this
established
health
care
system,
to
this
physician,
to
this
hospital,
now
you
must
go
elsewhere
because
the
state
tells
me
i
can't
talk
about
it,
is
a
new
obstacle.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
obstacle
such
as
subsidy
that
we
saw
in
maher
and
mcrae.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
because
i
think
that
creates
an
obstacle
that
did
not
previously
exist.
mr.
frank
susman
i
cannot
in
my
mind
compare
this
with
the
withholding
of
funding
which
created
as
this
court
said
repeatedly,
no
new
obstacle.
women
were
poor
before
and
by
denying
them
a
subsidy
we
are
not
creating
any
obstacle
that
did
not
previously
exist.
i
would
point
out
in
interpreting
this
section
as
the
lower
courts
have
done...
forget
the
lower
courts.
both
the
missouri
department
of
health
and
truman
medical
center
in
kansas
city,
both
the
head
person
in
each
case
issued
a
directive
and
their
own
interpretation
of
this
section
was:
no
more
discussion
about
abortion,
period.
you
may
not
discuss
the
subject.
and
this
was
from
the
state's
department
of
health
that
the
letter
went
out.
so
this
isn't
something
in
the
abstract
that
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
the
construction
that
the
lower
courts
found
was
something
that
they
had
to
stretch
for.
it
wasn't.
on
this
last...
lastly
on
this
point,
i
would
point
out
if
we
go
back
to
the
term,
the
parade
of
horribles
that
was
referred
to
in
akron,
where
certain
types
of
information
were
imposed
upon
a
physician,
that
he
had
to
tell
the
patient,
and
this
which
court
said
could
not
constitutionally
stand,
that
in
comparison
here
to
the
horrible
of
medical
ignorance,
this
one
is
much
worse.
i
would
address
the
next
section
which
the
attorney
general
refers
to
as
the
preamble,
which
i
think
is
a
misnomer.
the
statute
doesn't
call
it
a
preamble.
and,
in
fact,
there
are
other
sections
in
reality,
such
as
i
would
point
out
that
section
188.010
is
probably
more
aptly
a
section
that
qualifies
more
as
a
preamble
to
this
act
than
does
205.
what
troubled
me
perhaps
the
most
about
this
section
is
that
if
the
state
is
free
to
adopt
a
definition
of
when
human
life
begins,
which
they
have,
and
they
have
picked
out
conception
as
that
time,
then
clearly
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
a
second
state
from
picking
birth
as
when
human
life
begins,
and
a
third
state
from
picking
viability,
and
a
fourth
state
from
picking
12
weeks.
mr.
frank
susman
yes,
but
i
think
even
on
the
fourth
option.
let's
say
state
number
four.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
but
i
think
the
problem
here
is
that
the--
mr.
frank
susman
--i
think
this
is
somewhat
unique.
i
think
the
adoption
of
section
205,
first
of
all,
it
clearly
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
regulate
abortion
or
to
grant
property
rights
or
tort
rights
to
fetuses.
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
that
proposition
to
do
so.
other
states
have
clearly
done
so
without
making
these
types
of
purported
legislative
findings.
and,
therefore,
if
it
is
totally
unnecessary
to
do
that,
which
we
maintain
that
it
is,
then
what
they
really
have
done
is
to
adopt
a
particular
religious
belief
about
which
there
is
clearly
no
consensus
and
placed
it
into
the
law
of
the
land
of
the
state
of
missouri.
it
really
does
serve
no
purpose.
i
would
point
out
that
the
solicitor
general
in
its
brief
agrees
that
the
impact
of
this
on
abortion
is
quite
uncertain
at
page
8
at
footnote
5,
does
not
quite
buy
entirely
the
state's
position
that
this
has
no
impact
whatsoever.
the
lower
courts
address
mainly
in
the
point
of
impact
as
to
whether
or
not
the
additional
clause,
the
additional
section
that
says
anything
we
do
here
must
be
subject
to
the
supremacy
clause,
to
the
constitution
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
not
necessarily
at
all
to
the
decisions
of
any
lower
federal
courts
because
that
was
excluded
but
at
least
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
they
make
it
subject.
but
clearly
i
think
as
the
message
of
the
lower
courts
was,
whether
you
have
that
additional
disclaimer
or
not,
it
exists.
it
is
a
point
of
law
whether
you
codify
it
or
not.
mr.
frank
susman
because
i
am
not
totally
convinced
it
serves
no
purpose,
as
the
solicitor
general
was
not
totally
convinced.
in
fact,
typical
examples.
there
is
another
clause,
if
the
court
will
recall,
that
prevents
certain
civil
causes
of
action
against
pregnant
women,
but
it
does
not
in
any
way
prohibit
criminal
causes
of
action
for
things
that
pregnant
women
might
do
during
the
course
of
their
pregnancy.
this
section
has
already
been
used
by
a
circuit
court
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
to
force
a
caesarian
operation.
mr.
frank
susman
it
is
only
an
example
of
how
it
can
be
used.
mr.
frank
susman
it
would
be
used
to
prevent
in
vitro
fertilization.
clearly
that
would
be
murder
under
this
section.
