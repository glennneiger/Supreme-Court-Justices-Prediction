justice
scalia
i
might
also
be
the
official
who
expends
the
funds
knowing
they
are
going
to
be
used
in
violation
of
the
statute
is
liable
for
the
funds.
i
would
assume
so.
that
is
certainly
the
case
at
the
federal
level,
that
if
you
make
an
unauthorized
expenditure,
it
comes
out
of
your
pocket.
justice
scalia
could
i
interrupt
for
a
minute?
it
is
not
just
age
and
weight
as
you
mention,
but
also
lung
maturity.
justice
scalia
and
there
is
a
good
deal
of
evidence
that
that
is,
number
one,
useless
information
and,
number
two,
very
difficult
to
find
without
some
risk
to
the
pregnant
woman.
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
make
such
findings
to
the
extent
they
are
necessary.
it
says
to
the
extent
they
are
necessary
to
make
a
finding
of
the
lung
maturity.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
you
find
it
hare
to
draw
a
line
between
those
two
but
easy
to
draw
a
line
between
first,
second
and
third
trimester.
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
why
a
court
that
can
draw
that
line
can't
separate
abortion
from
birth
control
quite
readily?
justice
scalia
that
certainly
is
not
uncontested.
you
mentioned
the
historical
brief.
there
is
more
than
one
historical
brief
here
and
one
filed
by
the
association
for
public
justice
just
simply
contradicts
your
history
and
quotes
authorities
back
to
blackstone
and
cook
saying
that
at
common
law
abortion
was
unlawful.
justice
scalia
and
also
contradicting
your
contention
that
the
whole
purpose
was
to
protect
the
mother
and
not
to
protect
the
fetus.
justice
scalia
but
these
briefs
cite
cases
and
they
give
quotations.
those
cases
can
readily
be
consulted
and
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
and
there
are
a
lot
of
quotations.
and
even
without
the
brief,
i
know
that
there
was
regulation
in
the
20th
century
of
abortion.
i
mean,
that
is
just
a
common
knowledge.
justice
scalia
let
me
inquire...
i
can
see
deriving
a
fundamental
right
from
either
a
long
tradition
that
this,
the
right
to
abort,
has
always
been
protected.
i
don't
see
that
tradition.
but
i
suppose
you
could
also
derive
a
fundamental
right
just
simply
from
the
text
of
the
constitution
plus
the
logic
of
the
matter
or
whatever.
how
can...
can
you
derive
it
that
way
here
without
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
fetus
is
a
human
life
or
not?
it
is
very
hard
to
say
it
just
is
a
matter
of
basic
principle
that
it
must
be
a
fundamental
right
unless
you
make
the
determination
that
the
organism
that
is
destroyed
is
not
a
human
life.
can...
can
you
as
a
matter
of
logic
or
principle
make
that
determination
otherwise?
justice
scalia
i
agree
with
you
entirely,
but
what
conclusion
does
that
lead
you
to?
that,
therefore,
there
must
be
a
fundamental
right
on
the
part
of
the
woman
to
destroy
this
thing
that
we
don't
know
what
it
is
or,
rather,
that
whether
there
is
or
isn't
is
a
matter
that
you
vote
upon;
since
we
don't
know
the
answer,
people
have
to
make
up
their
minds
the
best
they
can.
justice
scalia
i
presume
in
order
to
comply
with
the
section
a
fiscal
officer
when
he
approves
a
program
has
to
make
sure
that
there
are
directives
issued
that
people
won't
give
advice
on
abortion.
justice
scalia
can
he
possibly
be
complying
with
this
program
unless
he
issues
such
a
directive?
and
would
not
the
failure
of
a
doctor
in
a
hospital
to
comply
with
the
directive
be
cause
for
dismissal?
justice
scalia
i
can't
imagine
that
it
wouldn't.
justice
scalia
he
could
give
the
advice,
he
could
tell
the
patient
up
front,
i
am
not
permitted
because
i
have
this
directive
that
comes
from
the
officer
that
dispenses
the
money,
i
am
not
permitted
to
advise
that
you
have
an
abortion.
i
recommend
that
you
consult
someone
who
is
able
to
give
that
advice.
he
could
say
that.
he
doesn't
have
to
give
the
bad
advice.
he
could
say:
short
of
that
option,
what
i
would
recommend
is
this
but
in
your
condition,
i
would
recommend
that
you
consult
someone
who
is
able
to
provide
you
advice
concerning
abortion.
i
am
not
able
to
do
that.
justice
scalia
why
is
it
any
different
from
the
physician
who
says
to
the
woman
who
is
his
long
time
client
at
this
hospital,
you
need
an
abortion.
i
am
sorry,
i
cannot
perform
the
abortion.
you
will
have
to
go
somewhere
else
to
get
it
done.
that
is
lawful,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
have
we
not
upheld
the
withholding
of
funding
for
public
money
for
abortion?
justice
scalia
but
he
makes
the
very
good
point
that
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
between
abortion
and
contraception
when
you
define
abortion
as
the
destruction
of
the
first
joinder
of
the
ovum
and
the
sperm.
justice
scalia
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
whether,
as
the
solicitor
general
argues,
you
can
overrule
roe
versus
wade
without
endangering
our
law
concerning
contraception.
