justice
stevens
general
webster,
can
i
ask
you
one
clarifying
question?
what
is
the
consequence
of
a
violation
of
that
section?
if
the
doctor
should
go
ahead
and
do
it,
is
he
committing
any
kind
of
a
misdemeanor
or
crime?
justice
stevens
i
am
just
asking
if
one
violates
section
205
or
210
or
215,
is
there
any
sanction
for
violation?
justice
stevens
it
is
not
a
misdemeanor?
what
is
the
state's
method
of
enforcement
then?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
what
if
a
doctor
who
had
a
patient
in
a
public
hospital
went
ahead
and
performed
in
the
first
trimester,
performed
an
abortion.
is
there
any
sanction
against
the
doctor
if
he
did
that?
justice
stevens
so
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor
then?
justice
stevens
what
is
your
opinion?
don't
you
know?
justice
stevens
is
it
your
opinion
as
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
state
that
it
would
not
be
a
misdemeanor?
justice
stevens
is
there
any
enforcement
provision
other
than
injunctive
relief?
if
the
doctor
went
ahead
and
did
it
and
you
don't
enjoin
him
in
time,
that
would
be
the
end
of
it?
justice
stevens
wouldn't
it
be
grounds
for
discharge
or
cause?
justice
stevens
the
statute
says
it
shall
be
unlawful.
i
assume
it
is
grounds
for
discharge.
justice
stevens
let
me
be
sure
i
understand.
you
are
saying
the
doctor
if
he
thinks
it
is
unnecessary
doesn't
have
to
perform
the
lung
test?
justice
stevens
what
if
he
has
determined
fetal
age
without
determining
weight?
why
would
the
weight
be
necessary?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
distinguish
weight
and
lungs?
justice
stevens
i
am
assuming
the
doctor
who
makes
a
determination,
doesn't
think
the
second
or
third
tests
are
necessary.
does
he
have
to
perform
them
anyway?
justice
stevens
you
have
to
make
findings
on
the
lung
too?
justice
stevens
what
is
your
view
on
what
the
statute
means?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
my
question
is
if
the
doctor
doesn't
think
it
is
necessary,
does
the
statute
require
him
to
make
the
finding
on
as
weight,
and
b,
lungs?
justice
stevens
on
neither?
justice
stevens
say
they
make
the
determination
that
it
is
not
viable?
justice
stevens
not
whether
it's
appropriate.
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
requires
it.
justice
stevens
with
all
three
tests?
justice
stevens
how
about
with
the
third
test?
justice
stevens
the
woman
appears
to
be
more
than
20
weeks
into
the
pregnancy.
does
the
doctor
have
to
perform
the
lung
test?
justice
stevens
he
thinks
it
is
not
necessary.
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
requires
him
to
do
it
even
if
he
doesn't
think
it
is
necessary,--
justice
stevens
mr.
fried,
is
there
a
difference
between
the
court's
power
in
the
case
of
an
abortion
that
would
be
life
threatening
to
the
woman
and
an
abortion
that
would
merely
cause
her
severe
and
prolonged
disease?
is
there
a
constitutional
difference?
justice
stevens
mr.
susman,
let
me
interrupt
you
there.
if
we
assume
because
the
attorney
general
didn't
really
know,
that
there
are
no
criminal
sanctions
attached
to
this
and
if
we
read
the
statute
the
way
that
we
would
read
it,
merely
a
restriction
on
what
agencies
may
do
in
supporting
programs,
is
there
any
possible
constitutional
objection
to
it?
justice
stevens
it
does
not
even
apply
to
a
physician
if
i
understand
your
opponent's
submission.
he
says
it
just
applies
to
appropriation
committees
and
funding
agencies,
they
shall
not
set
up
a
program;
and
that
a
physician...
he
says
this,
if
we
agree
with
it,
this
is
how
i
understood
him...
if
a
physician
should
give
such
advice,
that
would
not
violate
this
section.
that
is
what
he
says.
if
that's
true,
why
haven't
you
won
all
you
really
care
about
in
this
issue?
justice
stevens
it
just
applies
to
fiscal
officers
who
are
drafting
programs
on
how
to
spend
state
money.
they
just
should
not
adopt
a
program
advocating
abortion
and
if
that's
all
it
means,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
unconstitutional.
justice
stevens
because
my
freedom
to
do
so
has
been
abridged
by
this
statute.
yes,
he
could
even
add
that.
justice
stevens
mr.
susman,
if
it
doesn't
serve
any
purpose,
what
harm
does
it
do?
justice
stevens
i
know
about
that.
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
this
case?
i
don't
see
that.
justice
stevens
yeah,
it
might
be
used
in
a
tort
action
against
a
street
car
company.
justice
stevens
while
you
are
getting
ready,
general
webster,
i
would
like
you
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question
whether
in
the
funding
provision,
the
funding
officer
would
have
a
duty
to
promulgate
regulations
that
would
prevent
a
doctor,
a
state
employee
from
performing
abortions
and
the
like.
i
think
you
heard
the
colloquy
earlier.
justice
stevens
but
the
preamble
would
make
your
prohibition
against
abortions
in
public
facilities
apply
to
things
like
installing
an
iud
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
stevens
the
language
about
performing
or
counseling
about
abortions
doesn't
only
talk
about
post-viability
abortions,
does
it?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
no,
that's
not
my
question.
the
provisions
at
issue
in
this
case,
one
of
them
that
you've
argued,
prohibits
the
funding
of
paying
people,
on
the
public
payroll
to
perform
abortions.
the
concept
of
what
an
abortion
is
is
affected
by
your
preamble.
justice
stevens
yes,
public
funding.
justice
stevens
so
it
does
relate
to
the
very
issues
in
this
case.
