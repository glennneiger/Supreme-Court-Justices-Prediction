mr.
charles
fried
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
today
the
united
states
asks
this
court
to
reconsider
and
overrule
its
decision
in
roe
v.
wade.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
make
quite
clear
how
limited
that
submission
is.
first,
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
unravel
the
fabric
of
unenumerated
and
privacy
rights
which
this
court
has
woven
in
cases
like
meyer
and
pierce
and
moore
and
griswold.
rather,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
pull
this
one
thread.
and
the
reason
is
well
stated
by
this
court
in
harris
and
mcrae;
abortion
is
different.
it
involves
the
purposeful
termination,
as
the
court
said,
of
potential
life.
and
i
would
only
add
that
in
the
minds
of
many
legislators
who
pass
abortion
regulation,
it
is
not
merely
potential
life
but
actual
human
life.
and
though
we
do
not
believe
that
the
14th
amendment
takes
any
position
on
that
question,
we
think
it
is
an
utter
non
sequitur
to
say
that,
therefore,
the
organized
community
must
also
take
no
position
in
legislation
and
may
not
use
such
a
position
as
a
premise
for
regulation.
mr.
charles
fried
exactly,
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
in
griswold
against
connecticut,
there
was
a
right
which
was
well
established
in
a
whole
fabric
of
quite
concrete
matters,
quite
concrete.
it
involved
not
an
abstraction
such
as
the
right
to
control
one's
body,
an
abstraction
such
as
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
it
involved
quite
concrete
intrusions
into
the
details
of
marital
intimacy.
and
that
was
emphasized
by
the
court
and
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
the
court's
decision.
mr.
charles
fried
griswold
surely
does
not
stand
for
that
proposition.
mr.
charles
fried
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
fried
the
right
involved
in
griswold
as
the
court
clearly
stated
was
the
right
not
to
have
the
state
intrude
into,
in
a
very
violent
way,
into
the
details,
inquire
into
the
details
of
marital
intimacy.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
inquiry
into
the
marital
bedroom
and
i
think
that
is
a
very
different
story
from
what
we
have
here.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
that
that
question--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
would
hesitate
to
formulate
the
right
in
such
abstract
terms
and
i
think
the
court
prior
to
roe
v.
wade
quite
prudently
also
avoided
such
sweeping
generalities.
that
was
the
wisdom
of
griswold.
mr.
charles
fried
i
surely
do
not.
that
would
be
quite
a
different
matter.
mr.
charles
fried
because
unlike
abortion,
which
involves
the
purposeful
termination
of
future
life,
that
would
involve
not
preventing
an
operation,
but
violently
taking
hands
on,
laying
hands
on
a
woman
and
submitting
her
to
an
operation
and
a
whole
constellation--
mr.
charles
fried
--absolutely.
mr.
charles
fried
the
liberty
interest
against
a
seizure
would
be
involved.
that
is
how
the
court
analyzed
the
matter
in
griswold.
that
is
how
justice
harland
analyzed
the
matter
in
his
dissent
in
poe
v.
ullman
which
is,
in
some
sense,
the
root
of
this
area
of
law.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
would
think
that
there
are
liberty
interests
involved
in
terms
perhaps
of
the
contraceptive
interest,
but
there
is
an
interest
at
all
points,
however
the
interest
of
the
woman
is
defined,
at
all
points
it
is
an
interest
which
is
matched
by
the
state's
interest
in
potential
life.
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
define
it
in
terms
of
the
concrete
impositions
on
the
woman
which
so
offended
the
court
in
griswold
and
which
are
not
present
in
the
roe
situation.
finally,
i
would
like
to
make
quite
clear
that
in
our
view,
if
roe
were
overruled,
this
court
would
have
to
continue
to
police
the
far
outer
boundaries
of
abortion
regulation
under
a
due
process
rational
basis
test
and
that
that
test
is
muscular
enough,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
said
in
his
dissent
in
roe,
to
strike
down
any
regulation
which
did
not
make
adequate
provision--
mr.
charles
fried
--is,
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
a
case
which
draws
on
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
not
itself
a
fourth
amendment
case.
it
is
a
14th
amendment
case.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
court
would
have
ample
power
under
our
submission
to
strike
down
any
regulation
which
did
not
make
proper
provision
for
cases
where
the
life
of
the
mother
was
at
risk.
i
think
the
important
thing
to
realize
is
that
when
roe
was
decided,
it
swept
off
the
table
regulations
in
the
majority
of
american
jurisdictions,
including
regulations
recently
promulgated
by
the
american
law
institute,
and
declared
a
principle
which
said
that
it
was
unfair
and
unreasonable
to
regulate
abortion
in
ways
that
most
western
countries
still
do
regulate
abortion.
we
are
not
here
today
suggesting
that
the
court
would,
therefore,
allow
extreme
and
extravagant
and
bloodthirsty
regulations
and
that
it
would
lack
the
power
to
strike
those
down
if
they
were
presented
to
it.
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
that
alone,
among
government
institutions--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
that
is
a
matter
of
degree
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
severe
health
effects
shade
over
into
a
threat
to
the
life
and
i
cannot
promise
the
court
that
our
submission
would
dispense
the
federal
courts
from
considering
matters
like
that,
but
i
also
very
much
doubt
that
the
court
would
be
presented
with
many
such
situations.
what
is
necessary
is
for
the
court
to
return
to
legislatures
an
opportunity
in
some
substantial
way
to
express
their
preference,
which
the
court
says
they
may
express,
for
normal
childbirth
over
abortion,
and
roe
v.
wade
stands
as
a
significant
barrier
to
that.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
quite
clear
that
a
public
hospital
may
under
this
court's
decision
in
maher
and
in
harris
and
mcrae,
may
do
as
missouri
has
here
done
and
say
that
public
funds
cannot
be
expended.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
no,
i
think
there
is
not.
as
i
have
indicated,
i
think
the
constitution
takes
no
position
on
this
point.
there
is
a
certain
logic
in
some
of
the
provisions
which
say
that
there
should
be,
that
there
should
be
protection
further
back.
but
the
country's
experience
and
the
court's
experience
under
the
constitutionalization
of
that
issue
has
been
so
regrettable
that
i
could
not
in
conscious
recommend
that
it
be
constitutionalized
in
some
other
way
at
another
point
in
the
spectrum.
now,
if
the
court
does
not
in
this
case
in
its
prudence
decide
to
reconsider
roe,
i
would
ask
at
least
that
it
say
nothing
here
that
would
further
entrench
this
decision
as
a
secure
premise
for
reasoning
in
future
cases.
on
the
issue
of
stare
decisis,
it
seems
greatly
labored...
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
