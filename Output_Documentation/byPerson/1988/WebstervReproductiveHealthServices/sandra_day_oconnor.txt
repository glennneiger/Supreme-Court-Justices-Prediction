justice
o'connor
mr.
webster,
is
that
the
argument
you
made
below?
justice
o'connor
yes
i
know.
is
that
the
argument
you
made
with
regard
to
this
section?
justice
o'connor
do
you
say
there
is
no
fundamental
right
to
decide
whether
to
have
a
child
or
not?
justice
o'connor
a
right
to
procreate?
do
you
deny
that
the
constitution
protects
that
right?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
state
has
the
right
to,
if
in
a
future
century
we
had
a
serious
overpopulation
problem,
has
a
right
to
require
women
to
have
abortions
after
so
many
children?
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
rest
that
on?
justice
o'connor
and
you
would
rest
that
on
substantive
due
process
protection?
justice
o'connor
well
there
is
a
difference,
is
there
not
in
those
two?
justice
o'connor
when
the
fetus
was
first
felt
by
the
mother?
justice
o'connor
mr.
susman,
i
guess
the
states
courts
never
had
a
chance
to
interpret
their
own
state
statute.
justice
o'connor
and
i
guess
the
statute
is
subject
to
a
narrowing
construction.
justice
o'connor
i
thought
there
should
typically
try
to
be
a
construction
that
would
avoid
constitutional
difficulties,
not
encourage
them.
