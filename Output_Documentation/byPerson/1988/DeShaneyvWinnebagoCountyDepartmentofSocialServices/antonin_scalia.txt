did
they
at
that
point
commit
a
constitutional
violation?
that
is
the
time
when
they
placed
the
child
in
extreme
danger,
as
i
understand
justice
blackmun's
question,
is
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why...
why
was
that
a
constitutional
violation
to
return
the
child
at
that
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
how
do
you...
how
do
you
place
within
the
words
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
again?
how
is
the
state
depriving...
depriving
the
child
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
see
i
can...
i
can
understand
it's
depriving
the
child
of
something
when
the
child
is
safe
with
the
state
and
the
state
turns
it
back,
which
happened
here.
but
you...
you
acknowledged
that
when
that
happened,
it
was
all
right.
the
state
had
no
inadequate
reason
to
believe
that...
that
the
parent
was
abusive.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
understand
how
the
state
is
depriving
the
child
of
anything
when...
when
the
child
is
already
in
the
home
and
all
the
state
has
done
is
failed
to
take
the
child
out
of
the
home.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
that's
not...
well,
i...
i
could
think
of
a
lot
of
cases.
well,
that's
true
in
every
child
abuse
situation.
sure.
wasn't
that
always
true
in
a
child
abuse
situation?
when
a
social
worker
visits
a
home,
has
very
good
reason
to
believe
an
abuse
is
going
on,
you're
saying
there's
an
immediate
constitutional
duty
arise
to
remove
the
child
if
it's
close
enough
to
the
knife
at
the
throat
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is,
of
course,
all
shades
of
evidence.
this
is
not
quite
a
knife
at
the
throat
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
magical
about
the
fact
that
the
citizen,
here
the
child,
is
in
threat
from...
from
his
father
rather
than
from
someone
else?
suppose
a
case
worker
goes
in
and
finds
an
elderly
person
starving.
why
wouldn't
there
be
a
similar
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state?
why
wouldn't
you...
you
find
the
state
liable
for
depriving
this
person
of
life
if
the
person
dies
because
the
state
did
not
provide
food?
why
wouldn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how...
how
is
the
constitution
interposed
there?
i
don't...
i
don't
see
how
it's
interposed.
it's
interposed
when
the
state
moves
in
and
takes
the
child
away
and
then
gives
it
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
what
you're
saying
is
what
makes
a
difference
is
whether
you're
just
returning
him
to
the
status
he
was
in
before
you
took
over
the
temporary
custody.
is
that...
is
that
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
increased
it
from
what?
from
what
it
was
before
the
state
took
custody
or
from
what
it
was
when
the
state
had
custody?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
just
talking
here
about
whether
there's
a
federal
cause
of
action.
i...
i
presume--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
presume
that
there
would
be
a
state
cause
of
action
against
the
officer
in
those
circumstances
if
he
had
a
duty
to
act
and
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
giving
him
back
to
his
father?
what...
what...
what...
what's
the
government's
position
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
state
had...
well,
let's
assume
the
state
had
a
lot
of
knowledge
at
the
time
the
child
was
returned
to
his
father.
would
you
consider
that
to
be
enough
affirmative
state
action
to--
