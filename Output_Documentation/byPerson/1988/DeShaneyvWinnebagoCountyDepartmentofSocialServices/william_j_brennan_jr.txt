justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sullivan,
let
me
put
it
another
way.
this
child
was
severely
injured.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
state
placed
him
in
a
position
of
extreme
danger,
did
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
put
him
in...
not
eventually,
but
they
put
him
in
a
position
of
extreme
danger.
it
certainly
turned
out
to
be
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
suppose
the...
the
state
or
the
county,
municipality
knew
that
it
was
putting
the
child...
placing
the
child
in
a
situation
of
extreme
danger.
do
you
have
any
trouble
in
working
out
liability
on
that
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wonder
why
you
don't
argue
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--that
she
knew--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in...
in
effect
admitted
that
she
knew--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
way
i
parse
your
case,
and
maybe
it
is
a
step
ahead.
but
it
doesn't
shock
me
as
much
as
it
seemed
to
shock
some
of
my
brethren.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
sullivan,
aren't
there
any
wisconsin
tort
remedies
assuming
you're
right--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they're...
if
they're
adequate,
isn't
that
the
end
of
your
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is...
there's
a
limitation
of
some
amount,
isn't
there,
on
a--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--state
tort
remedy?
