do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
what
agent
of
the
state
finds
outs
that
this
child
is
in
danger
from
his
father?
suppose
it's
just
a...
suppose
it's
a
trash
collector
that
goes
around
and
finds
out
that
it's
official...
and
he
just
knows
that
that
child
is
in
real
danger.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
has
to
be
a
certain
kind
of
a...
of
a
state
agent
who
has
a
duty
under
state
law
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
it
a
state
law...
isn't
it
a
state
law
issue
here
then
as
to...
do
you...
do
you
suggest
that
this
social
worker
was
violating
state
law
when
she--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
there
any...
do
you
have
some
wyoming
cases
for
that?
wisconsin.
wisconsin
cases.
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you're
from
cheyenne,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
your
theory,
i
take
it
if
two
policemen
see
a
rape
and
watch
it
just
for
their
own
amusement,
no
violation
of
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not...
you're
arguing
it
as
well
as
conceding
it.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
you...
i
take
it
you
don't
agree
with
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
that
the
social
worker
was...
was
disregarding
her
duty
under
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
a
police
officer
responding
to
a
complaint
of
a
neighbor
goes
into
a
house
and
sees
a
father
beating
up
his
son
and
the
officer
just
says,
well,
i
guess
the
son
deserves
it
and
just
watches
as
the
beating
goes
on?
would
there
be
any
liability
on
the...
on
the
officer
himself
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--[inaudible]
on
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
protection
is
never
one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
that
the
constitution
would
require
the
state
to
furnish.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
the...
even
if
the
state
law
put...
put
the
affirmative
duty
on
the
officer
or
the
social
worker
to
remove
the
child
or
stop
the
abuse
if
it
occurs
in
their
very
presence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
my
only
purpose
of
asking
the
question
is
that
i...
i
take
it
that...
that
you
had
to
answer
that
way
and...
but
also
it
makes
irrelevant
how
much
the
social
worker
knew.
