we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
87-154,
joshua
deshaney
v.
winnebago
county
department
of
social
services.
mr.
sullivan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
derive
all
this
from
the
language
of
the
due
process
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a...
a
right
against
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
but
it's
protected
only
against
the
state.
it's
not
protected
against
private
individuals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
says
that
a
state
shall
not...
what
does
it
state...
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
certainly
we've
held
in
many
cases
that
the
state
may
not
deprive
someone
of
life,
but
we've
never
held
that
that
provision
protects
in
the
constitutional
sense
a
private...
a
private
attack
on
another
person.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a...
that's
a
limitation
on
the
state...
those
cases.
they
say
the
state
can't
do
certain
things.
you're
trying
to
turn
that
around
and
say
that
arising
out
of
that
same
relationship
is
a
duty
on
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no
doubt.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
see
how
you
turn
that
around
and
say
from
these
limitations
on
the
state,
we
also
derive
a
duty
on
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
try?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
limitations
on
the
state's
authority
to
take
the
child
away
from
the
parent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought...
but
i
thought
that
was
the
basis
of
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
argue
that
in
the
lower
courts?
i
looked
through
judge
reynolds'
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
didn't
argue
the
roth
entitlement
in
the
lower
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
some...
do
you
have
some
case
in...
in
wisconsin
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
it
was
intentional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mingo,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
lower
courts
didn't
reach
any
of
those
issues,
did
they,
because
they
found
there
was
no
constitutional
duty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr....
mr.
mingo,
i
wonder
if
you
wouldn't
be
better
advised
to
use
the
term
"constitutional
duty"
rather
than
state
action.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
social
worker
was
a
state
actor.
she
was
a...
she
was
a
public
employee
doing
this,
and
her
acts
were
those
of
the
state.
your
point
really
is
that
she
was
not
under
a
constitutional
duty
to
do
certain
things
that
your
opponent
says
she
was
under
a
duty
to
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mingo.
mr.
ayer,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
mr.
sullivan,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sullivan.
the
case
is
submitted.
