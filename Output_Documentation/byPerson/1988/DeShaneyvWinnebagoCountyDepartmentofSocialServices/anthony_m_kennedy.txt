but...
but
the
rights
of
the
parent
are
recognized
to
the
extent
that
the
state
may
not
interfere
with
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the...
and
the
question
here
is
the
extent
to
which
you
impose
a
mandatory
duty
on
the
state
to
act
affirmatively
to
protect
the
child.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
fact
that
it's...
that
other
cases
are
not
workable
seems
to
me
not
the
point.
the
question
is
where
do
you
derive
the
duty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
xxx.
well,
it
applies
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
too
if
the
state
can't
take
away
the
person's
food,
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
state
has
to
give
the
person
food.
and
you're...
you're
in
the
same
box
either
way
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
is
a
constitutional
obligation
i
would
assume
not
to
arbitrarily
take
it
away.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so,
there's
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so,
the
constitution
is
in
the
house
with
the
elderly
woman
just
as
it's
in
the
house...
just
in
the
same
sense
that
it's
in
the
house
with
the
parent
and
the
child.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
that...
was
that
just
a
negligent
omission
or
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wasn't
it
just
a
failure
to
realize
that...
that
a
breach
of
duty
was
involved,
a
negligent
failure
to
know...
know
her
duty?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if
you
don't
give
it
back
to
the
father,
but
you
give
it
back
to...
to
the
wrong
person?
you
give
it
back
to
some...
some--
--some
child--
--right...
some...
some
mad
criminal
who
has
just
been
released
from
a
mental
institution
knowing
or
you
ought
to
know
that
this
is
not
the...
not
the
father.
would
the
state
have
any
liability
in
those
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
were
just
returning
it
to
the
person
who
had
the
legal
right
to
custody.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
there
was
further
information
received
by
the
social
worker,
wasn't
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the...
wasn't
there
visits
after
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
better...
that's
better
than
having
a
written
report
i
suppose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
submission...
the
submission
is
that
the
social
worker
knew
enough
that
under
state
law
it
was
her
duty
to
take
the
child
out
of
the
house
or
do
something
to...
to
remove
the
child
from
that
position
of
danger.
and
you
disagree
with
that
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what...
what
was
the
purpose
of
investigating?
wasn't
there...
didn't
the
law...
doesn't
the
law
say,
well,
and
if
you
find
out
certain
things,
you
must
do
certain
things?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
you
really
are
drawing
the
distinction
between
a
formal
report
and
an
informal
investigation.
no
matter
how
much
she
uncovers,
if
no...
there
is
no
resulting
formal
report,
no
possible
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
that's
just
what
you've
been
arguing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
and
if...
but
if
we...
if
we
decide...
if
we...
if
we
decide
for
the
state,
it...
it
really
does
mean
that
it's
irrelevant
how...
how
much
the
social
worker
knew
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--how
much
of
a
duty
she
had
under
state
law
or
anything
else.
