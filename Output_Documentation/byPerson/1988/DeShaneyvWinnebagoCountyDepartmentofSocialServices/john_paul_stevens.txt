justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
didn't...
the
child
had
already
been
placed
by
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
january
of
1983.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
and
you
say
that
was
not
a
constitutional
violation
to
return
the
child
then.
when
did
the
constitutional
violation
occur
and
what
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
the
very
next
one
then
you
say
it
did
occur.
and
what
was
the
constitutional
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
get
to
the
constitutional
violation
and
when
it
occurred.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
just
summarizing,
what
you're
saying
is
it's...
she
got
sufficient
information
on
that
occasion
that
she
had
a
constitutional
duty
to
remove
the
child.
and
that
was
the...
that
was
the
constitutional
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
isn't
that
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
your
theory
is
not
that
the
state
placed
the
child
in
a
position
of
extreme
danger,
but
rather
that
the
state
failed
to
remove
the
child
from
a
position
that
they
should
have
known
was
extremely
dangerous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
your
case
be
any
different
if
you
had
none
of
this
history
but
a
very
stupid
social
worker
who
went
in
and
saw
lots
of
evidence
of
child
abuse
and
failed
to
remove
the
child
from
the
home
immediately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know.
the
word
"enmeshment"
is
not
one
that
really
helps
me
very
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
if
you
just
have
those
stark
facts,
a
social
worker
visits
a
home,
sees
the
child
that
a
reasonable
social
worker
should
have
known
was
in
extreme
danger--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
fails
to
remove
the
child,
has
the
state
committed
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i've
given
you
the
facts.
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
pretty
serious,
but
you
say
the
evidence
is
clear
enough
so
that
the
constitutional
duty
arose
to
remove
the
child.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
i...
i'm
sure
justice
stevens
is
going
to
ask
the
same
question.
so,
go
on.
you
take
it,
john.
[laughter]
why
wasn't
that
what
happened
in
january
of
1983
when
they
returned
the
child?
is
that
what
you
were
going
to
ask?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
had
custody
of
the
child
for
a
few
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
and
assume,
having
done
that,
the
hospital
now
learns
if
we
return
the
child
to
his
father,
the
father
has
the
knife
and
is
about
the
abuse
the
child,
do
you
say
the
state
can
go
ahead
and
return
the
child?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
with
knowledge
that
there's...
even
with
knowledge
of
extreme
danger
and
almost
certain
serious
abuse
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
that
different
then
from
the
foster
home
case
that
justice
o'connor
asked
you
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
during
those
three
days,
the
child
was
in
the
custody
of
the
state,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
owned...
who
operated
the
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
who
had
custody?
you...
you
don't
think
the
state
or
this
agency
had
custody
of
the
child
during
that
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
statute
required
whom
to...
to
return
the
child?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
was
it
that
had
the
duty
to
return
the
child?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
supposing
the
juvenile
court
is
given
evidence
that
if
you
return
the
child
to
the
home,
the
child
will
be
seriously
abused
forthwith?
xxx.
would
the
state
be
liable
if
it
went
ahead
and
returned
the
child?
justice
john
paul
stevens
xxx
state
action
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
--but
your--
--that's
never
been
argued
around
here.
but
your
basic
position
is
there's
no
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
the
government
to...
to
provide
the
protection
of
the
law
to
a
particular
citizen--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--even
though
there
is
a
duty
to
provide
equal
protection
of
the
law.
