mr.
mark
j.
mingo
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
this
case
involves
an
attempt
by
the
petitioners
to
transform
the
private
wrongdoing
of
a
natural
father
into
state
action
for
purposes
of
invoking
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
primary
issue
presented
is
whether
a
county's
failure
to
prevent
the
infliction
of
harm
by
a
third
party
upon
a
person
at
liberty
constitutes
a
due
process
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
believe
that
there
was
no
state
deprivation
of
a
constitutionally
protected
right
for
three
main
reasons.
first,
the
fourteenth
amendment's
concept
of
liberty
does
not
include
a
right
to
basic
protective
services
from
the
state.
secondly,
there
is
no
state
action
in
a
constitutional
sense
which
caused
a
deprivation
in
this
case.
third,
we
believe
that
the
actions
of
the
social
worker
did
not
evince
the
state
of
mind
necessary
to
invoke
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
addition,
we
believe
that
there
are
two
independent
reasons
for
urging
affirmance
of
the
seventh
circuit's
decision.
first,
with
respect
to
the
municipal
respondents,
there
was
no
policy
or
custom
which
led
to
a
deprivation
and
with
respect
to
the
individual
respondents,
we
believe
they
are
clearly
entitled
to
the
defense
of
qualified
immunity.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
us
that
what
petitioners
are
attempting
to
do
is
use
section
1983,
on
one
hand,
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
the
other
hand
to
affirmatively
compel
the
states
to
act
to
protect.
yet,
in
analyzing
the...
the
legislative
history
and
intent
of
section
1983,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
statute
was
not
designed
for
those
purposes.
section
1983
is
remedial
in
nature.
therefore,
we
must
look
to
the...
the
constitutional
right
that
the
petitioners
seek
to
invoke
by
way
of
use
of
section
1983,
which
brings
us
precisely
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
viewed
by
this
court
as
imposing
no
constitutional
duty
upon
the
states
to
provide
substantive
services
to
its
citizens.
the
court
also
has
held
that
if
the
state
chooses
to
provide
some
form
of
protective
services,
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
tell
the
state
how
far
they
must
go
in
providing
those
services.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
justice
o'connor,
in
that
instance,
we
believe
there
may
well
be
potential
liability
because
in
that
case
we
have,
at
least
arguably,
state
action
in
the
sense
that
the
state
took
a
child
out
of
his
natural
surroundings,
arguably
put
him
in
state-controlled
surroundings
and
thereby
increased
the
risk
of
harm
to
that
child.
in
that
instance,
i
believe
we
may
well
have
a
case
somewhat
analogous
to
the
prison
setting
and
perhaps
more
analogous
to
the
mental
institution
setting
that
was
present
in
youngberg
v.
romeo.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
in
january
of
1983--
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
--the
hospital
had
custody
of
the
child
because
of
the
fact
that
the
juvenile
court...
not
the
social
workers,
not
the
department
of
social
services,
but
wisconsin
juvenile
court...
through
its
intake
worker
placed
the
child
in
the
temporary
custody
of
a
hospital.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
although
that
is
certainly
not
the
case
before
this
court,
in
that
instance,
i
believe
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
only
a
county
or
a
department
of
social
services
could
return
the
child
without
facing
constitutional
liability.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
even
with
that
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
in
the
foster
home
setting,
we
have
the
state
taking
a
child
away
from
his
natural
surroundings,
putting
him
in
another
set
of
surroundings,
which
are
state
controlled,
state
operated--
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
--no,
that's
quite
different
from
what
happened
here.
here
we
have
a
child
being
taken
out
of
his
home
for
three
days
by
the
juvenile
court
and
then,
because
no
petition
was
filed
by
the
corporation
council
which
was...
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision
of
the
social
worker,
but
the
corporation
council
failed
to
filed
a
petition.
therefore,
the--
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
--no.
the
child
was
in
the
custody
of
the
hospital.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
as
far
as
i
know,
it
was
a
public
hospital.
the
child
was
placed
there
for
purposes
of
examination
only.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
the
agency
i
believe
definitely
did
not
have
custody
of
the
child.
i
also
don't
believe
this
was
a
state-run
institution.
the
reason
that
the
child
was
placed
in
this
hospital
was
for...
primarily
for...
for
observation
and
secondly
because
his
father
could
not
be
located.
the
child
was
examined.
after
the
three
days
in
the
hospital,
it
was
the
concurrence
by
the
hospital
personnel
and
by
the
corporation
council
that
evidence
of
abuse
could
not
be
substantiated.
that
automatically
triggered
wisconsin's
statute
coming
into
play
which
required
that
the
child
automatically
be
returned
to
the
parent
in
the
event
a
petition
was
not
filed--
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
--pardon
me?
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
wisconsin's
statutes
say
that
the
juvenile
court...
not
the
social
worker,
but
that
the
juvenile
court
must
return
the
child
to
the
home
in
the
event
a
petition
is
not
filed
within
72
hours.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
even
though
we
may
have
the
requisite
state
of
mind,
your
honor,
present
in
that
case,
i
do
not
believe--
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
--i
don't
believe
in
that
instance
we
would
have
state
action
because
we
have
not
done
anything
to
increase
the
risk
of
harm
to
that
child,
whereas
in
justice
o'connor's
example,
we
certainly
can
be
said
to
have
increased
the
risk
of
harm
to
the
child
because
we
took
that
child
away
from
his
or
her
natural
surroundings
and
put
that
child
into
an
arguably
more
dangerous
set
of
surroundings.
and
we
believe
that's
what
triggers
state
action.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
justice
scalia,
i
believe
in
that
set
of
circumstances
there
well
may
be
liable...
liability
because
we
have
state
action--
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
--i
believe
that
the
important
factor
to
be
looked
at
is
whether
or
not
the
state
action
can
fairly
be
said
to
have
increased
the
risk
of
harm
to
that
child.
if
the
answer
to
that
threshold
question
is
yes,
then
i
believe
we
have
state
action
in
a
constitutional
sense.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
from
what
it
was
before
the
state
interjected
and
took
custody.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
that's
correct.
when
an
individual
such
as
the--
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
--we're
not
saying
it's
more
important,
but
the
parents
certainly
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
which
must
be
observed
by
the
social
worker.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
if
there
was
any
malfeasance,
that
certainly
would
be
an
argument.
the
record
is
quite
clear,
though,
that
all
of
the
professionals
in
this
case,
the
pediatrician,
the
child
psychologist,
the
police
officer
who
investigated
the
case...
they
all
believed
that
abuse
could
not
be
substantiated.
every
one
of
the
professionals
involved
concurred,
and
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
in
that
regard.
they
all
concurred
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
substantiate
a
claim
for
child
abuse.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
i'm
now
talking
about
the
january
22
incident
where
the
state
arguably
took
custody
or
custody
was
placed
with...
with
the
hospital.
at
that
time
there
was
an
initial
suspicion
of
child
abuse
which
after
the
three-day
stay
in
the
hospital,
all
professionals
agreed
could
not
be
confirmed.
in
looking
at
this
court's
decisions,
it
appears
to
us
that
state
action
has
been
found
primarily
in
two
settings:
first,
and
most
obviously,
where
the
state
goes
out
and
directly
inflicts
harm
upon
an
individual;
secondly,
state
action
has
been
found
in
a
custodial
setting
where
the
state
by
its
intentional
act
deprives
a
person
of
liberty,
and
by
depriving
that
person
of
liberty,
assumes
a
degree
of
control
over
that
individual
such
that
they
have
a
reasonable
means
of
protecting
that
individual,
such
as
in
a
prison
setting,
and
where
they
assume
some
responsibility
for
that
individual's
welfare.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
yes,
your
honor,
you're
quite
correct.
state
action
can
be
quite
misleading,
and
when
i
use
the
term
"state
action",
i'm
trying
to
use
it
in
a
constitutional
sense
which
necessarily
implies
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
we
would
concede
that
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
that's
correct.
in
this
case
it
is
undisputed
by
both
sides
that
there
was
no
direct
deprivation
or
direct
infliction
of
harm
upon
the
petitioners
nor
was
the
petitioner
in
the
custody
of
the
state
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
wrongdoing.
in
order
to
circumvent
the...
the
state
action
or
constitutional
deprivation
requirement,
counsel
has
proposed
in
their
brief
a
special
relationship
theory
which
today
they
appear
to
call
an
enmeshment
theory.
no
matter
what
it
is,
this
theory
would
hold
states
liable
wherever
they
have
expressed
a
desire
to
afford
protection
to
an
individual
and
where
they
have
some
generalized
knowledge
of
the
victim's
plight.
we
submit
that
such
a
theory
has
no
support
in
the
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
no
support
in
section
1983,
nor
does
it
have
any
support
in
any
prior
decision
of
this
court.
what
their
theory
would
do
is
open
up
local
governments
to
massive
new
areas
of
exposure
precisely
because
of
the
fact
that
the
states,
if
we
were
to
accept
petitioners'
theory,
become
liable
for
the
acts
of
private
wrongdoers.
there
are
numerous
governmental
agencies
other
than
social
services
departments
which
seek
to
afford
some
degree
of
protection
to
the
public.
certainly
police
departments,
fire
departments,
emergency
ambulance
services
fall
into
that
very
same
category.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
petitioners
are
to
prevail
in
these
types
of
cases,
the
effect
will
be
to
greatly
expand
the
financial
drain
on
local
governments
thereby
making
the
very
services
that
petitioners
claim
they
wish
to
encourage
less
available
to
the
public
as
a
whole.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
he
certainly
would
have
a
cause
of
action
against
his
father.
in
fact,
his--
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
--that...
that
immunity
was
done
away
in
wisconsin
some
10
or
15
years
ago.
and,
in
fact,
i
might
note
that
randy
deshaney,
the
father,
was
in
fact
a
party
defendant
to
this
action
when
it
was
first...
when
the
complaint
was
first
filed.
he
was
subsequently
dismissed
on
a
voluntary
basis
by
counsel.
so,
he
was
in
fact
a
party
defendant,
and
there
was
no
objection
on
the
basis
of
immunity.
again,
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
problem
with
this
special
relationship
or
enmeshment
theory
is
that
it
fails
to
distinguish
between
privately
inflicted
harm
and
state
action.
on
the
other
hand,
we
believe
that
the
court's
adherence
to
the
traditional
state
action
or
constitutional
deprivation
requirement
provides
a
bright
line
standard
which
would
separate
actions
of
private
wrongdoing
from
actions
which
can
fairly
or
truly
be
attributed
to
the
states.
we
also
believe
that
the
petitioners
cannot
prevail
upon
their
fourteenth
amendment
claim
because
the
social
workers
in
this
case
did
not
evince
the
state
of
mind
necessary
to
support
a
fourteenth
amendment
action.
this
court
has
recently
told
us
in
daniels
and
davidson
that
negligence
certainly
is
not
enough.
and
the
court
also
indicated
to
us
that
traditionally
the
due
process
clause
has
been
applied
to
deliberate
decisions
by
government
officials
to
deprive
a
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property.
this
case
we
believe
is
even
less
constitutionally
compelling
than
daniels
and
davidson
because
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
custodial
setting,
and
we
are
faced
with
claims
of
inaction
versus
action.
in
such
circumstances,
we
have
proposed
that
the
requisite
state
of
mind
must
be
that
of
deliberate
indifference
or
a
failure
to
act.
and
the
reason
we
propose
this
heightened
state
of
mind
requirement
is
twofold.
first,
we
believe
it
avoids
trivializing
the
constitution
by
allowing
individuals
to
bring
ordinary
tort
claims
in
the
name
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
we
also
believe
that
this
heightened
state
of
mind
requirement
recognizes
the
real-life
dilemma
which
front-line
social
workers
and
many
other
governmental
workers
face
on
a
daily
basis.
as
the
seventh
circuit
indicated
below,
social
workers
truly
do
operate
on
a
razor's
edge.
first,
a
social
worker
must
respect
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
parent
to
the
care,
custody
and
management
of
their
children.
secondly,
where
a
social
worker's
involvement
is
on
a
purely
voluntary
basis,
such
as
it
was
in
this
particular
case,
she
must
walk
a
fine
line
to
avoid
having
the
door
slammed
in
her
face
thereby
preventing
any
future
involvement
of
the
department.
this--
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
--we
certainly
do
not
agree
with
that
position,
and
we
believe
the
record
is
quite
clear.
the
only
duty
she
had
under
state
law
was
to
investigate
when
she
received
a
report
of
abuse.
the
only
report
of
abuse
which
the
department
ever
received
in
this
case
was
the
initial
report
of
suspected
abuse.
immediately
following
that
report,
there
was
an
investigation.
the
child
was
placed
in
the
hospital
for
three
days
and
then,
since
there
was
no
filing
of
a
petition
at
the
end
of
three
days,
the
child
was
automatically
returned
to
the
home.
after
that
first
incident,
there
was
absolutely
no
further
reports
of
abuse.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
there
was
information
in
the
sense
that
the
social
worker
suspected
that
there
might
be
abuse.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
by
the
social
worker?
in
fact,
there
were
12
visits
on
a
voluntary
basis.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
in
fact,
those
were
tantamount
to
informal
investigations.
but
there
was
only
one
formal
investigation,
and
that
was
triggered
by
the
initial
report
of
abuse.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
we
do
disagree
with
that.
under
state
law,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
only
duty
that
the
social
worker
had
was
to
investigate.
and
she
only
had
a
duty
to
investigate
when
she
received
formal
reports
of
abuse.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
the
law
doesn't
say
that,
but
i
believe
the
law
probably
presupposes
that
if
there
is
an
investigation
and
that
investigation
reveals
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
child
abuse,
that
that
information
will
be
relayed
to,
in
this
instance,
the
corporation
council
who
will
then
file
a
petition
in
juvenile
court.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
the
only
formal
investigation--
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
--a
formal
investigation
is
an
investigation
triggered
by
the
statute.
and
the
statute
only
triggers
a
duty
to
investigate
when
the
social
worker
receives
a
report
of
abuse.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
again,
the...
a
formal
investigation
is
any
investigation
triggered
by
the
statute,
48...
section
48.981.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
question,
justice
marshall,
is
to
tell
you
that
a
formal
investigation
is
one
that's
triggered
by
a
statute.
an
informal
investigation
is
one
voluntarily
undertaken
by
the
social
worker.
the
net
effect
may
be
the
same,
but
the
triggering
process
is
different.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
that's
not
the
basis
of
our...
our...
our
position
is.
mr.
mark
j.
mingo
what
i've
been
attempting
to
argue
is
that
a
formal
report
is
required
to
trigger
an
investigation.
if
she
receives
a
formal
report,
then
she
does
have
some
affirmative
duties
