mr.
donald
james
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
contending
today
not
for
a
broad
constitutional
mandate
to
the
states
to
do
all
good
things
to
all
people,
nor
do
we
contend
for
a
broad
constitutional
duty
to
prevent
all
harm
or
all
sadness,
nor
do
we
contend
for
a
broad
constitutional
duty
to
protect
all
children
in
all
cases.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
none
in
those
situations--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--justice
white.
we
do
suggest
that
there
is
one
and
only
one
exquisitely
narrow
circumstance
where
there
is
an
affirmative
duty.
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
two
primary
elements
to
the
one
and
only
one
circumstance
for
which
we
argue.
the
first
is
the
existence
of
a
child/parent
relationship.
the
other
is
what
i
term
enmeshment,
intricate
intimacy,
enmeshment
of
the
agents
of
the
state
in
a
particular
circumstance
which
would
have
three
characteristics:
the
first,
an
extreme
danger
to
a
particular
individual
child;
the
second,
abundant
actual
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
agents
of
the
state;
and
the
third,
an
actual
undertaking
by
the
state
to
protect
the
child.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
indeed,
your
honor.
we
think
it
arises
from
that
and
from
the
nature
of
the
relationship
and
from
the
way
the
court
has...
has
accorded
the
relationship.
if
i
may...
if
i
may
explain.
it
is
my
view...
it
is
our
view
that
the
protector
of
the
child,
the
raiser
of
the
child,
the
person
with
the
right
and
the
power
and
the
authority
and
the
duty
to
educate
the
child,
teach
the
child,
provide
medical
care,
all
those
parental
things,
including
setting
bedtime,
is
the
parent
and
not
the
state.
the...
the
other
side
of
that
coin
is
that
there
is
one
and
only
one
circumstance
where
when
the
family
unit...
and
i
don't
care
whether
it's
a
married
family
or
a
step-parent
or
whatever,
but
when
the
child
is
at
home
and
the
door
is
closed
to
the
world,
the
people
with
whom
that
child
is
locked
in,
his
natural
and
his
inherent
protectors,
from
those
individuals
alone,
whether
it's
a
father,
a
step-mother,
a
live-in
girlfriend
of
what
have
you...
from
those
protectors
alone
he
has
no
protection.
and
in
that
one
and
only
one
circumstance,
i
think
that's
appropriate.
and
i
would
further
respond
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
by
saying
this.
it
is
only
in
that
one
circumstance,
as
i
understand
the
cases...
it
is
only
in
that
one
circumstance
that
the
court
has
already
interposed
any
aspect
of
the
constitution.
and
i
don't
want
that
changed.
i
don't
ask
that
that
be
applied
to
a
different
circumstance.
what
i'm
saying
is
this.
take
the
situation
where
the
child
is
locked
behind
the
door
with
his
protector
and
the
protector
becomes
the
predator,
and
a
proceeding
is
brought
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
child
protection
spectrum
to
terminate
the
parental
rights.
the
court
has
already
said
that
the
constitution
governs
that
relationship.
the
court
has
already
recognized
it
in
the
relationship
between
the
adult
and
the
child
that
the
constitution
prevails
and
it
prevails
both
substantively
and
procedurally.
what
i
mean
is
this.
we
know
that
any
parent
has
a
constitutionally
recognized
right
to
the...
if
i
may
simplify
it,
to
the
possession
of
the
child,
care,
custody,
companionship,
all
those...
all
those
kinds
of
things
that
go
with
being
a
parent.
we
also
know
that
that
right
of
parenthood
cannot
be
terminated
except
by
procedural
due
process
protections.
so,
i'm
saying
to
the
court
that
in
that
most
intimate
relationship,
the
court
has
already
recognized
that
the
constitution
has
application.
the
court
additionally
has
recognized,
i
believe,
that
a
child...
indeed,
any
of
us...
has
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
physical
integrity,
to
bodily
protection.
what
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--and
a
right
that...
that
arises
out
of
the
constitution
to
remain
alive,
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
well,
i
think
that's
part
of
what
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
address
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
would
further
agree
that
in
the...
in
the
context
in
which
prior
to
today
that
question
has
been
addressed
by
the
court,
i
agree
that
that's
the
correct
holding.
for
example,
if
you
were
to
hold
otherwise,
then
the
police
department
would
have
an
obligation
to
prevent
the
mugging
and
a
whole
host
of
things
that
are
simply
unworkable
and
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
constitution.
what
i...
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that,
first
of
all,
this
is
a
question
in
the
most
intimate
relationship.
that
has
not
been
addressed,
to
my
knowledge,
by
the
court
before.
and
i
think
that
it's
consistent
with
the
nature
of
the
circumstance
that
we're
dealing
with,
and
i
think
it's
consistent
with
the
other
constitutional
applications
the
court
has
afforded
to
the
child/parent
relationship.
if
you
have...
if
you
have
the
parent
and
child
in
an
intimate
relationship
and
the
constitution
properly
lies
in...
in
that
setting,
and
if
the
rights
of
the
parent
with
all
of
his
natural
powers
in
addition...
if
the
rights
of
the
parent
are
recognized,
why
should
the
rights
of
the
child
be
less
recognized?
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
simply
a
balancing
in--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i
think
that's
entirely
true.
and--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--that's
right,
justice--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--well,
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
derive
the
duty
first
and
foremost
from
the
nature
of
the...
of
the
relationship
that
you're...
that
you're
analyzing
in
a...
in
a
constitutional
setting,
and
secondly,
from
the
fact
that
the
constitution
does
admittedly
apply
in
that
relationship.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
justice
o'connor,
i...
i
generally--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--the
only
word
i
would...
i
would
differ
with
you
is...
is
the
word
"far".
it
occurs
to
me...
obviously,
the
prison
cases
are
in
an
eighth
amendment
context,
so
they
are
not...
they
are
not
the
identical
setting.
the
institutionalized,
hospitalized
settings
like
youngberg
is
the
other
category
to
which...
to
which
i
think
you
refer.
and
i
think
that...
i
think
that's
what
the
notion
of
enmeshment...
and
that's
not
a
phrase
that
i'm
aware
the
court
has
used.
that's...
that's
a...
that's
a
word
that
i
use
for
my
own
understanding
and
the
clarity...
i
hope
the
clarity
of
my
own
thinking...
that
i
think
that's
what's
described
there
is
to
what
extent
has
the
state
become
involved
in...
in
the
life
of
this
person.
if
i
may
give
an
example.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
if...
if
the
circumstance
were
as
you...
as
you
phrased
it,
justice
o'connor,
i
would
agree.
if...
and
the
seventh
circuit
addressed
that
in
its
razor's
edge
argument.
the
seventh
circuit
said
you
would
put
child
protection
authorities
in
a
damned
if
we
do,
damned
if
we
don't
situation.
but
this
court
relatively
recently
decided
daniels
and
decided
davidson,
and
i
think
solves
that
problem
entirely
because
i
understand
under...
under
those
cases
that
even
if
we
guess
wrong,
we
are
safe
from
liability.
and
that's...
that's
vitally
important
here.
i
understand
daniels
and
davidson...
again,
to
simplify
in...
in
paraphrasing...
to
say
even
if
you're
negligent,
it's
okay
in
a
1983
setting.
and
the
court
reserved
for
another
occasion...
i
think
this
may
well
be
the
occasion...
the...
the
question
of
something
more
aggravated
than...
than
negligence.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
this.
in
the
whole
range
of
state
action
dealing
with
children,
all
conduct
that
is...
let's
assume
that
we
can
recognize
some
standard.
all
conduct
that
is
proper,
obviously,
is
not
actionable.
all
conduct
that
is
negligent
is
not
actionable.
and
it
has
never
been
in
contest
that
if
we
had
the
circumstance
where
the
police
officer
or
the
child
protection
worker
or
someone
else
were
inflicting
a
beating...
you
know,
that's
not
the
kind
of
case
we're
talking
about.
and
the
next
topic,
obviously,
that
we
have
to
address
is
the
question
of
whether
it's
gross
negligence,
deliberate
indifference
or
what
have
you.
so,
i...
i
respectfully
and
very
strongly
suggest
that
it's
not
a
question
of
do
we
guess
wrong
at
our
peril.
we...
under
the
existing
holdings
of
this
court,
which
i
do
not
ask
the
court
to
change,
we've
already
said
to
the
child
protection
agency
it's
okay
to
guess
wrong.
it's
okay
if
you
make
a
mistake.
and
that
has
to
be.
i
think
government
can't
function
without
that--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--well,
i...
i
think
first
i
have
to
persuade
you
that
the
child
has
an
entitlement
and
the--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--well,
there
are
two.
the
one...
the
one
i've
addressed,
which
is
the...
the
substantive
due
process
inherent
in
the
relationship
and
inherent
in
the
constitutional
control
of
the
child/patient...
parent
relationship.
the
second
one--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i
feel
that
from
that
arises
an
entitlement
in
the
extreme
and
only
in
the
extreme
circumstance
that
i
posit
to
the
court.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
the
wisconsin
standard
is
mere
negligence.
the
wisconsin
state
tort
law
standard
is
mere
negligence,
and
this
court
has
already
said
that's
not
acceptable
in
a
1983
context.
justice
brennan,
your...
your
question
to
me
was...
was
do
i
have
to
persuade
you--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--that
the
child
has
an
entitlement
under
wisconsin
law.
that's
addressed
in
the
briefs.
that
would
be
basically
the
roth
approach
to
it,
and
that's
a...
that's
a
separate
approach
which
i'm
happy
to
address
at
this
juncture
since
you...
since
you
put
the
question.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
eventually
they
did,
yes,
sir.
and
the
reason
for
that--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--when
they...
when
they
unilaterally
returned
him
to
the
abusive
father,
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
no,
your
honor.
i
have
no
trouble.
and
i
would
further
say
that
that's
not
a
supposition
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
well,
i
did--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i
did
in
my
pleadings,
but
i...
i
would...
i
would
remind
the
court
that
one
of
the...
and
we
addressed
it
three
or
four
or
five
times
in
our
brief.
not
to
rehash,
but
because
i
think
it's
so
important,
this
case
worker...
the
evidence
in
the
record
before
the
court
demonstrates
that
she
told
witnesses...
and
i
think
i'm
quoting
accurately...
"i
always
knew
the
phone
would
ring
some
day
and
joshua
would
be
dead.
"
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
i
understand
it
that
way.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
i
understand
it
that
way,
yes,
sir.
now--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
that
was...
that's
how
i
understand
that...
that
language.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
yes.
the...
the...
the
hangup
that...
that
i
think
i've
seen
in
reading
the
colloquy
in
our
briefs
on
the
notion
of
intent...
we
do
not
argue...
we
certainly
do
not
argue
that
the
case
worker
or
the
supervisor
or
the
county
wanted
this
child
dead.
that
would
be
irresponsible,
and
we
don't
make
that
claim.
but
we
do,
based
on
the
record
that's
in...
in
front
of
you...
and
i
think
the
joint
appendix
at
109
to
160
is
the...
is
the
dss
case
file
itself,
and
that
i
find
shocking...
quite
candidly,
i
find
shocking.
we
know
that
there
were...
and
justice
brennan,
you
alluded
to
this.
there
are
black
and
white
absolute
mandates
in
the
state
statute
that...
that
say
when
you
receive
a
report
from
a
doctor
or
from
a
nurse
or
from
an
outside
social
worker
or
from
a
police
agency
suggestive
of
child
abuse,
you
shall
investigate.
it
doesn't
go
into
you
got
to
do
it
this
way
or
that
way,
but
you
got
to
make
a
real
investigation.
you
got
to
do
it
in
a
timely
manner.
on
the
first
occasion
in
january
of
1982
that
the
police
reported
suspected
child
abuse,
they
made
an
investigation
which
was
cursory
but
i
can't
fault
them
at
that
point.
they
complied
with
the
statute.
in
january
of
1983,
they
had
a
doctor
report
from
a
hospital...
they...
saying
i
am
finding
an
abused
child
here.
they
take
custody
of
the...
of
the
child.
three
days
later
they
send
the
child
back
to
the
abusive
home.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
that
was,
but
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
the
next
incident
was.
and
the
difference
was
that
they
were
informed
by--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--they
took
the
child
out
and
placed
the
child
in
the
technical
custody
of
the
hospital
during
his
period
of
hospital
confinement.
that's
right.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
yes,
sir,
which
is
the--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i
think
it
was
the
very
next
contact
they
had
with
the
child
and
each
succeeding
contact--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--at
that
point...
and
by
way
of
background
information
so
that
we're
clear
on
this,
if
i
may,
justice
stevens...
the...
when
the
case
worker
made
the
decision
to
return
the
child...
and
this
is
in
the
record
at
159
and
160...
she
dismissed
the
protective
proceeding
that
they
had
started,
and--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i
don't
think
so.
what
she
said,
though,
in--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--all
right.
what
i...
i
need
you
to
understand
that
she
made
a
written
promise
to
the
child
and
to
the
family
court
that
the
very
next
time
there
was
a
suspicious
lesion
on
this
child,
she
would
bring
the
matter
back
to
the
court
for
the
child
to
be
protected.
she
made
that...
that
promise
to
the...
now,
the
child
was
a
toddler,
so
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
child
understood
that.
but
she
made
that
guarantee
and
it
was
on
that
premise
that
the
child
i
think
erroneously
was
returned.
the
very
next
time
she
was
in
the
house
all
of
the
things
that
she
had
insisted
on,
all
of
the
things
that
had
been
guaranteed
by
the
birth
father,
all
of
the
things
that
were
necessary
for
the
child's
protection
had
been
absolutely
thrown
out
the
window.
for
example,
the
father
told
the
county
that
it
was
the
girlfriend
who
had
abused
him
on
this
occasion.
and
that's
probably
credible
because
he
was
out
of
town
on
a
fishing
trip.
so,
he...
he
probably
was
not
the
physical
abuser
in
that
case.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
on
the...
on
the
ensuing
occasion?
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
yes,
yes.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
subsequently.
i
think...
i
think
that
that
placing
the
child
back
is
the
ultimate
act--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--it's
a...
it's
a
question
of
the
level
of...
of...
and
that's
why
i'm
using
the
word
"enmeshment".
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
okay.
i...
i
think
that--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--yes.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
in
an
appropriate
fact
setting,
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
if
we...
to...
to...
to
illustrate
what
i
think
your
question
is,
if
on
the
very
first
occasion--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--maybe
even
by
accident,
stopping
to
use
the
phone,
no
official
business,
and
the...
and
a
case
worker
finds
the...
the
parent
holding
a
knife
to
the
throat
of
a
toddler,
i
would
say
that
obligation
arises
at
that
point.
yes,
sir.
now,
that's
not
the
factual
setting
that
we
have
here.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
it
is
the
state
alone--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--well--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--well,
that's
the...
that's
the
final
argument
in
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
that
all
we
did
was
not
stop
it.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
in
this
one
and
only
one
circumstance,
the
child
has
no
one
else.
the...
the
only
protector
he
has
in
the
world
is
now
the
predator.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
right.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
i
think
the
evidence...
and,
yes,
i
do.
and
i
want
to...
i
want
to
mention
as
well
that
the
evidence,
of
course,
is
cumulative
so
that
even
if
the
second
or
third
or
fourth
instance,
if
you
feel
that's
not
enough,
the
14th
or
15th
or
20th
instance
certainly
is.
you
know,
i...
i
lose
track
of
how
many
different
doctor
reports
of
abuse
there
were
and
how
many
different
nurse
abusive
reports
there
were...
reports
of
abuse
there
were
and
how
many
direct
observations
on
separate
occasions
by
the
case
worker.
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
after
two
years,
approximately,
of
this,
when
the
case
worker
goes
to
the
home
and
sees
cigarette
burns
on
the
face
of
the
child,
i
suggest
that's
knowledge.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
to
the...
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
in
the
first
place
the
constitution
does
not
intrude
into
each
individual
life
in
the
sense
of
an
obligation
to
provide
food,
shelter,
clothing.
that's
a
political
issue.
the
constitution
is
interposed
in
the
relationship
between
the
child
and
its...
and
its
parent.
and
that's
the
only
place
in
that...
in
that
child's
life
where
the...
where
the
constitution--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--it's
interposed,
more
precisely,
when
the...
when
the
state
says
we
suspect
there
might
be
a
problem
for
this
child.
we're
going
to
terminate
your
rights.
at
that
point
there's
no
question
but
what
the
parent's
constitutional
rights
in
the
relationship
are
recognized,
both
his
substantive
rights
to
his
possession
of
his
child
and
his
procedural
rights
to
have
witnesses
and
hearings
and
burdens
of
proof
and
all
those
kinds
of
things.
and
if
we
have
one...
one
equation...
and
the
constitution
is
in
here
for
the
parent
and
we
know
the
constitution
recognizes
the
child
has
at
least
the
right
to
be
alive
and
more
or
less
healthy--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i...
i
think
that
the
procedural
things,
mr.
chief
justice,
clearly
are...
are
limitations
on...
on
the
mechanics
by
which
you
can
effect
a
termination.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
well,
if
we've
recognized...
and...
and
manifestly--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--well,
i...
i
hope
so.
i
hope
so,
mr.--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--okay.
the...
the
situation
of
the
child,
his
place
in
the
world,
when
the
door
is
closed,
there...
there
literally
is
no
one
else.
and
if
the
child
has--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--no.
and
i
don't...
i
don't
propose
that
for
that--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
we
recognize
that
the
constitution
has
a
legitimate
place
in
the
relationship
between
the
parent
and
the
child.
if
it
does,
i...
i
suggest
that
it
should
fairly
apply
both
ways.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
me
that
the...
the
constitution
applies
between
the
parent
and
the
child
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
parent.
and
i
think
that's
the...
that's
the
result.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
well,
i
agree
that
there's
no
obligation
to...
to
provide
food
to
somebody.
in
fact,
i
would
say
there's
not
a
constitutional
obligation
to
provide
food
to
a
child.
that's
not
what
i'm...
that's
not
what
i'm
suggesting.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
yes.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
that's
a--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i...
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
question
or...
or
i'm
seeing
it
very
differently.
clearly
you
can't
send
the
agent
of
the
state
in
to
empty
out
the
old
person's
refrigerator,
you
know,
without...
that's...
no
one
is
going
to
fight
about
that.
that's
different
from
saying
that
you
have
to
create
a
responsibility
where
you
have
to
bring
food
to
the...
to
the
elderly
person.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
yes.
i
do
think
it
makes...
it
makes
a
difference.
in
contemporary
society,
we
have...
in
all
the
states,
we
have
child
protection
agencies.
and
certainly
i
would
think
they
would
be
within
the
scope
of
the--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i
think
that
would
be
correct.
certainly
someone
with
the
power
under
state
law.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
in
addition,
yes...
yes,
sir,
we
do
because
of--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i'm...
i'm
a
citizen
of
wyoming.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
yes,
sir.
the--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--there
clearly
are.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
there
clearly
are
state
tort
remedies.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
a
negligence--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i
think
it
would
be
as
to
the
property
interest
claim.
what
i...
what
i
have
to
say
on
that
is
this.
i
believe
that
the
child's
entitlement...
and
this
is
the
roth
analysis.
now,
i
believe
the
child's
entitlement
is
to
the
procedural
protections
of
the
investigation
and
the
intervention.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
no,
it
wasn't
addressed,
mr.
chief
justice,
at--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--no.
we
raised...
we
raised
the
statutory
claim
in
the...
in
the
complaint.
it
was
not
a
factor
in
either
judge
reynolds'
or
judge
posner's
decision.
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
there
is--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--there
is--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--yes.
yes,
justice
brennan.
i
am
not
here
arguing
that
the
dollar
amount
makes
that
remedy
insufficient.
i
am
not
arguing
that
at
all.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
under
the
state
system,
the
objective,
the
stated
objective
of
it,
is
the
well-being
of
the
child,
the
safety
of
the
child,
and
i
suggest
that
no
after-the-fact
damage
action
can
address
that
question.
the
only--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--well,
you
have
the
record
before
you
which
reflects
that
on
countless
occasions--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--the
statute
says
by
its
terms
when
you
get
notice
of
evidence
of
child
abuse,
you
shall
make
a
fresh,
de
novo
investigation--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--promptly
and
you
shall
intervene
as
appropriate.
on
time
after
time
after
time,
there
was
notice
of--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--this
is
the
only
circumstance
we've
been
able
to
find
in
wisconsin
where
this
has
occurred.
we're
not
trying
to
pick
on
wisconsin.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
but
the
fact
is
that
if...
if
the...
if
the
rule
says
that
when
the
members
of
the
court
come
in,
i
have
to
stand
up,
it's
a
simple
matter
of
whether
i
stood
up
or
not.
and
that's
the...
that's
the
situation
that
we
have.
they
simply
in
the
face
of
doctors'
warnings,
nurses'
warnings,
their
own
observations
of
profound
abuse--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--in
the
sense
that
the--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--no.
i
think...
i
think
that
it
was
not
malicious.
i
think
it
was
intentional
in
the
sense
of
knowing
and
understanding
the
significance
of
the
action
and
nonetheless
choosing
not
to
act
to
do
the
things
the
statute
says
you
must
do.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
no.
i
think
it
was
a
very
conscious,
a
deliberative,
a
thought-through
decision.
and
i
think
that's
part
of...
and--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--if
we
didn't
have
the
factual
setting
in
the
record
of...
of
the
lady
saying
to
people
she
believes
on
a
current
basis
the
child
is
being
abused
and
saying
later
i
believed
the
child
was
going
to
die,
that
might
be
the
case.
but
i
think
given
the
facts
that
exist,
i
don't
think
that's
the
situation.
i
have
only
two
minutes
left.
obviously,
i'll
answer
your
questions.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
little
time
there
may
be,
if
that's
acceptable.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
thank
you.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
due
process,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
we...
we
posed
this
case
in
terms
of--
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
we
feel
there...
there
are
two:
one,
the...
what
we
see
to
be
a...
a
substantive
due
process
right
inherent
in
the
balancing
of
the
constitutional
involvement
in
the
child/parent
relationship.
mr.
donald
james
sullivan
we
object
to
the
fact
that
the...
the
county
agency
and
its
personnel
knowing
and
believing
that
the
child
was
probably
going
to
die
or
at
least
be
seriously,
as
he
turned
out
to
be,
profoundly
injured
and
knowing
that
he
was
in
immediate
need
of
medical
care
for
lifesaving
purposes,
nonetheless,
despite
its
power,
its
exclusive
power,
refused
to
help
the
child.
it
is
that
that
we
believe
is
the
abuse
of
power.
and
we
agree
with
mr.
ayer's
comment
that
abuse
of
power
is
the...
is
the...
is
the
key
here.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
