mr.
donald
b.
ayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
address
the...
the
due
process...
the
deprivation
of
due
process
analysis
briefly
if
i
could,
but
before
i
do,
i'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
relationship
between
federal
and
state
government
and
the
role
of
the
federal
constitution
because
i
think
it
is
reasonably
clear
that
the
area
of
child
protection
is
not
one
that
is
crying
out
for
federal
constitutional
oversight.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
an
area
where
there
is
any
sort
of
history
of
hostility
between
the
state
and
the
interests
that
we're
talking
about
trying
to
protect.
quite
the
contrary.
there
being
no
constitutional
right
to
this
protection
in
the
first
place,
it's
clear
i
think
that
the
state
programs
that
have
been
set
up
have
all
been
set
up
as
a
matter
of
state
and
local
government
initiative
born
of
exactly
the
same
sentiments
and
concerns
that
everyone
feels
toward
children
who
are
exposed
to
the
kinds
of
abuse
and
hazards
that
we're
sadly
reviewing
in
this
case.
so,
we
don't
have...
we
don't
have
a...
a
state
actor
who
there
is
a
need
to
step
in
front
of
and
stop
in
any
sort
of
habitual
way.
the
state
is
actively
intervening
to
do
all
that
it
reasonably
can
do.
second
of
all,
i
think
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
federal
oversight,
federal
constitutional
oversight,
is
going
to
add
very
much
to
the
handling
of
these
sensitive
and
difficult
problems.
there
is
i
think
little
reason
to
think
that
federal
courts
have
any
special
expertise
in
the
reviewing
of
what
is
at
least
in
some
sense
a
balance
between
interests
of
parents,
respect
for
the
interest
of
parents
in
controlling
their
children,
as
opposed
to
the
priority
of
intervening
when
you...
when
you
need
to
and
must
in
order
to
protect
the
child.
it's
the
kind
of
a
sensitive
situation
that
requires
close,
on-the-scene
involvement,
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
the
exercise
of
a
great
deal
of
care
and
concern.
it's
an
area
of...
of
traditional
state
law
involvement
and
local
government
handling.
and
the
idea
that
at
a
federal
court
review
engrafted
on
top
of
what
is
already
in
place,
machinery
that
has
been
put
in
place
by
the
state
and
local
governments...
the
idea
that
that
is
going
to
help
rather
than
hurt
i
think
is...
is
really
a
misguided
one.
we're
talking
about
a
number
of
things.
we're
talking
about,
number
one,
creating
another
layer
of
judicial
action,
judicial
review,
which
itself
will
result
in
delay.
it
will
divert
resources
from
the...
the
real
everyday
problems
and
the
handling
of
these
personal
situations.
we
are
talking
possibly
not
only
about
awarding
damages
and
creating
a...
a
chill
and
a
discouraging
factor
which
justice
o'connor
alluded
to
being
involved
at
all,
also
a
day-to-day
possible,
i
suppose,
injunctive
role
for
the
federal
courts
coming
involved
not
only
after
the
fact
when
something
has
happened
to
award
damages,
but
becoming
involved
as
these
cases
evolve.
you
go
to
the
local
court.
you
go
to
your
local
social
service
agency.
you
go
to
the
local
court,
and
then
you
go
to
federal
court.
the
idea
that
that
is
somehow
going
to
help
the
resolution
of
these
problems
seems
to
be...
seems
to
be
misguided,
and
i
think
there
is
a
good
reason
to
fear
that
it
may
well
just
primarily
discourage
the
involvement
of
local
agencies
for
fear
that
they're
going
to
be
facing
an
unmanageable
and
very
expensive
situation.
all
of
that
is
basically
irrelevant
unless
it
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
law
and
what
the
constitution
requires.
and
very
briefly
i'd
like
to
say
that
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
when
you
take
to
heart
the
court's
statements
that
the
due
process
clause
is
not
to
be
a
font
of
tort
policy
which
will
evolve
as
tort
policy
does
in
response
to
various
economic
and
distributive
concerns
and
theories
and...
and
sort
of
comes
and
goes
with...
with
social
concerns
and
the
social
situation,
it's
clear
that
we
can't
create
the
liability
which
is
requested
by
the
petitioner
here
without
really
creating
an
open-ended
possibility--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
don't--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
don't
think
that
there
is
going
to...
i
think
the
answer
is
probably
no.
it
might
change
depending
on
the
particular
facts
you're
talking
about,
but
i...
i
think
it
has
got
to
turn
on
whether
what
happens
can
be
described
as
an
abuse
of
government
power
which
is
a
moving
force
behind
the
harm
that
is
taking
place.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
don't
think
that
the
state
is
obligated
to
provide
a
particular
service
as
desirable
as
that
may
be
and
as
concerned
as
most
everyone
probably
is
that
that
not
go
on.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it
might
be
possible
to
write
a
statute
in
a
way
that
created
a
procedural
due
process
interest.
i
don't
know
quite
how
you'd
do
that,
but
you'd
have
to
link...
the
words
would
have
to
be
fairly
mandatory
and
would
have
to
link
rather
closely
to
the
harm
that
you're
talking
about
now
occurring.
and
if
that
happened,
the
question
would
then
be
about
the
adequacy
of
the
remedy
that
was
provided
for...
for
the
harm
when
it
did
in
fact
occur.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
absolutely.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
in
most
cases,
i
would
think
there
would
be.
and,
of
course,
the
point
i
guess
i
was
making
earlier
in
summary
is
that
there
is
no
reason
why
we
can't
rely
on
the
mechanisms
of
state
and
local
government
to
create
the
remedies
that
are
appropriate
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i...
i
think
that's
right
unless
you...
unless
you
are--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct
unless
you
are
thinking
of
going
down
the...
the
roth
line
of
argument
which
i
think
is...
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
there...
there's
a
duty--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
right.
that's
right.
and...
and
i
think...
i
think
the
way
that
one...
what
one
would
have
to
do
to
violate
equal
protection
of
the
law
is...
is
useful
in
thinking
about
how
to
think
about
a
violation
of
due
process
in
the
sense
that
there
the
denial
of
equal
protection
which
could,
in
fact,
be
other
than
an
affirmative
act
or...
or
the
government
being
a
moving
force
behind
the
harm,
nonetheless
it
must
be
intentional.
it
must
be
an
act
which
intends
the
result...
the
denial
of
the
protection
that
they
otherwise
would
be
entitled
to.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
concept
of
intent...
whereas
it's...
it
probably
is
not
the
best
way
to
decide
this
case,
i
would
suggest
that
an
intent
to
take
an
action
which
does
deprive
one
of
liberty,
such
as
by
putting...
putting
them
in
jail,
putting
them
into
a
mental
facility
or
something
like
that,
that
that's
the
kind
of
intent
that
you
ought
to
have
to
have.
that's
an
issue,
of
course,
the
court
did
not
reach
in
davidson
and
daniels
as
to
whether
that
degree
of
intent
is
required.
we
would
suggest
that
it
is.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
xxx
the
case?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i...
i...
i
would
think
not
and
the
reason
would
be
that
the
removal
in
this
case
was
a
temporary
removal
for
specific
purposes.
the
father
remained
the
legal
custodian
of
the
child.
no
affirmative
action
had
been
taken
to
determine
that
the...
the
father
was
unfit
and
that
the
expiration
of
this
temporary
period,
absent
further
action,
the
child
was
going
to
go
back
to...
to
the
parent.
and
the
fact
that
it
did
not
take
that
affirmative
action,
but
rather
let
the
status
quo
continue,
i
think
is
not
the
kind
of
affirmative
action
that
you've
got
to
have
in
order
to
have
the
state
be
the
moving
force...
its
abuse
of
power
be
the
moving
force
behind
the
injury
that
occurred.
thank
you
very
much.
