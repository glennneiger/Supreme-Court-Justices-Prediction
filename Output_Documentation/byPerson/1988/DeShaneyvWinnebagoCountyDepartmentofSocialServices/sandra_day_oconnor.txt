well,
the
only...
the
only
cases
in
which
the
court
has
found
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
provide
basic
services
is
in
a
setting
like
a
prison
or
a
state
institution
where
the
state
has
already
deprived
the
individual
of
the
individual's
liberty
and
institutionalized
them.
justice
sandra

o'connor
this
is
certainly
a
step
far
beyond
that
that
you're
asking
us
to
take.
justice
sandra

o'connor
if...
if
your
theory
were
to
be
accepted,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
a
real
deterrent
effect
on
state
child
abuse
programs.
why
would
a
state
want
to
undertake
a
child
abuse
program
at
all
if
they
face
liability
if
they
guess
wrong?
i
can't...
i
think
you're
asking
the
court
to
take
a
step
that
is
perhaps
quite
unwarranted
and
quite
dangerous.

mr.
mingo,
if
this
child
had
been
in
foster
care
placed
by
the
state
or
the
county,
would
there
be
potential
liability?
