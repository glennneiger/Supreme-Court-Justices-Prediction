mr.
stephen
goldsmith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
let
me
just...
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
we
think
we're
here,
your
honor.
the
indiana
supreme
court
consolidated
fort
wayne
and
indianapolis,
which
is
called
4447,
and
then
this
court
consolidated,
when
it
accepted
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
indianapolis
and
fort
wayne
cases
with
the
kokomo
case,
which
is
called
sappenfield--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
right.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
well,
it's
a
procedural
question,
your
honor.
the
indiana
supreme
court
consolidated
under
the
4447
court
cause
number,
4444
and
fort
wayne.
this
court
then
accepted
certiorari
on
that
cause
number
in
both
of
those
cases.
we
are
listed
as--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
yes.
except
none
of
the--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--well,
because...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
the
confusion,
your
honor,
is
that
the
defendants
in
that
case
did
not
become
petitioners
in
this
case.
the
4447
defendants
didn't
elect
to
participate
in
the
argument
today.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
well,
your
honor,
this
court
accepted
certiorari
for...
under
a
petition
that
came
from
a
cause
number
that
included
4447
and
included
fort
wayne.
the
defendants
in
4447
elected
not
to
participate,
but
the
court
granted
certiorari.
the
petitioners
listed
the
state
as
a
respondent
and
myself...
i'm
listed
as
a
respondent.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
very
well--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--justice
scalia,
i
think
if
i
could
address
my
remarks
to
the
overall
issue
of
the
rico
laws
and
the
only
reason
that
the
indianapolis--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--yes,
sir.
i
represent--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
those
were
all
of
the
defendants
who
were
rearranged--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--well,
they
are
here
as
not...
pursuant
to
this
court's
rules,
they
are
here
as
nominal
respondents
because
they
did
not
elect
to
come
forward
as
petitioners.
but,
nevertheless,
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--i
represent
sappenfield,
fort
wayne
and
if
4447
is
here,
i
represent
them
as
well.
i
represent
the
state
of
indiana
in
the
consolidated
rico
cases
that
are
before
this
court.
the
only
significance
to
4447
other
than
a
fact
that
it
continues
as
a
case
when
this
court
is
finished
with
it,
is
that
it
is
a
civil
rico
case
without
pretrial
seizures,
sappenfield
is
a
criminal
case
that's
been
stopped
midstream
without
any
pretrial
seizures,
and
fort
wayne
is
a
case
with
39
prior
convictions
and
pretrial
seizures.
they
represent
a
range
of
what
can
happen
underneath
the
rico
laws.
in
terms
of
directing
attention
to
the
issues,
though,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
most
important
issue
in
terms
of
law
enforcement
in
the
long
run
is
whether
in
enforcing
a
rico
law
after
judgment,
and
after
conviction,
the
state
may
impose
sanctions
that
affect
first
amendment
materials.
it's
the
post-trial,
post-judgment,
post-conviction
remedies
that
can
be
applied
to
assets,
regardless
of
whether
those
assets
expressive
materials,
as
alluded
to
in
the
arcara
case,
that
are
of
critical
importance
in
this
case
and
in
the
future
rico
enforcement.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
yes,
your
honor.
but
he
tried
to
limit
that
at
tracing.
our
position
is
that
it
would
not
stop
there.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
i
don't
agree
that
that
could
necessarily
happen.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
justice
white,
i
think
in
terms
of
post-trial
sanctions,
it
has
not
happened
in
any
one
of
these
cases.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
my
position,
justice
stevens,
is
post-trial
that
becomes
an
eighth
amendment
question,
which
could
or
could
not
occur,
depending
on
the
proportionality
of
the
response.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
i
could--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--i
could
ask
for
that
remedy
and--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--it
would
be
a
proportionality
question.
i
would
be...
officially
i
would
be
entitled
to
it
under
the
statute.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
if
i
convince
the
judge
and
the
jury
and
then
the
outside--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
there
was
a--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--in
the
fort
wayne
case,
that's
true.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
well,
it
was
based
on
the
allegation
that
there
had
been
39
prior
convictions
at
those
three
stores.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
nor,
justice
white,
no
one
of
these
cases
takes
the
position
that
whether
or
not
the
materials
seized
are
obscene
is
significant.
it's
as
to
whether
they
are
the
proceeds
of
a
prior
existing
crime
to
wit
an
obscenity.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
maintains
that
once
there
is
an
adjudication
of
obscenity,
then
it
becomes
a
proportionality
question
because
of
39
prior
convictions,
each
conviction
carries
a
year
sentence.
so,
the
prosecutor
had
his
choice
between
putting
the
owner
in
prison
for
39
years
or
confiscating
$25,000,
$50,000
or
$100,000
worth
of
books.
that's
a
relationship--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--the
indiana
and
federal
racketeering
laws,
it's
the
position
of
the
respondents,
allow
seizure
of
proceeds
and
also
seizure
of
other
assets
if
they
are
derived
from
a
criminal
activity
to
wit--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--yes,
justice
white.
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
in
the
trial
court,
just
because
there
is
a
sanction
allowed
statutorily
for
a
crime
doesn't
mean
that
the
maximum
is
automatically
going
to
be
imposed.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
i
meant
to
answer
justice
stevens,
his
direct
question.
we
would
be
allowed
to
ask
that
under
the
statute.
it
wouldn't
in
any
way
be
mandatory.
the
trial
judge
would
have
discretion
to
fashion
the
penalty
in
the
same
way
he
would
fashion
the
penalty
in
years,
fashion
the
penalty
in
terms
of
fine,
and
fashion
the
penalty
in
terms
of
confiscation
and
forfeiture
of
assets.
they
all
are
ways
to
enforce
a
law.
rico,
as
this
court
has
ruled
is--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--that's
the
state's
position.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
there
has
to
be
a
nexus
between
what
you're
trying
to
forfeit--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--and
what
you
have
previously
convicted
for
or
judged.
what
we
disagree
with
the
petitioners
on
is
the
need
to
trace
the
assets
from
book
up
to
organized
crime
back
to
another
bookstore.
we
don't
believe
that
that--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--the
people
would
need
to
be
same.
you
would
have
to
show
that
they
invested
money
from
the
first
criminal
proceeds
into
the
second
criminal
proceeds.
you'd
have
to
show
relationship
in
terms
of
enterprise
between
those
two.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
yes.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
it
does.
but
just
so
i...
it's
automatically
is
subject
to
forfeiture.
that
doesn't
automatically
mean
that
a
court
would
exercise
its
discretion
if
there
were
a
proportionality
problem.
the
same
is
true...
this
case
is
no
different
than
the--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--it
does.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
the
court,
it's
the
state's
position,
would
fashion
the
remedy
at
the
extent
and
scope
that
it
wished.
the
same
as
the
39
prior
convictions,
it
could
put
the
person
who
owned
it
in
jail
for
39
years
or
one
year.
similarly,
we
view
this
case
as
an
arcara
case
and
that
simply
says
that
this
is
no
different
than
if
there
was
narcotics
sold
at
store
one
and
the
person
sold
the
cocaine
three
times
and
two
times,
took
the
money
and
went
into
business
in
a
toy
store
or
bookstore
or
any
other
sort
of
store.
that
would
be
subject
to
the
confiscation
of
the
state.
and
to
rule
that
this
case
is
anything
else,
would
reduce
the
sanctions
of
racketeering
laws.
it
would
provide
a
safe
haven
behind
expressive
materials
for
organized
crime.
that's
why
we
believe
this
case
is
an
arcara
case.
and
if
it's
not
an
arcara
case,
it's
an
eighth
amendment
case.
but
it's
surely
not
a
first
amendment
issue.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
justice
o'connor,
this
is
the
most
difficult
position
for
the
state
to
maintain
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
it
is
the
position
of
the
state--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--that
if
in
the
fort
wayne
case
with
39
prior
convictions
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
an
allegation
of
identity
of
parties
that
that
was
permissible
conduct,
but
we
admit,
your
honor,
that
that
is
the
most
difficult
position
for
the
state
to
maintain
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
yes,
we
concede
that.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
and
that's
one
reason
that
it's
come
back--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--well,
i
think
that
if
it
doesn't
apply...
we
may--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--it
would
not
apply,
your
honor,
because
of
the
39
prior
convictions.
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court...
because
this
is
really
just
a
continuation
of
the
first
action.
federal
rico
is
all
in
one
action
and
indiana
rico
collateral
estoppel
from
the
criminal
cases.
i
would
also
acknowledge,
your
honor,
this
is
a
very
difficult
position
for
the
state
and
it
may
be
that
the
rico
laws
pretrial
ex
parte
we
have
a
brockett
severance
issue
that
ought
to
occur
here
as
it
relates
to
the
pretrial
ex
parte
seizures.
i'm
going
to
be
very
careful,
though,
to
separate
that
in
terms
of
my
argument
from
the
sanctions
post-trial
which
we
believe
present
an
arcara
issue.
but
i
do
acknowledge
that
the
pretrial
seizures,
without
a
hearing,
present
a
very
difficult
position
for
the
case,
for
the
state
and
it's
based
on,
however,
the
prior
39
convictions.
that's
the
way
we
distinguish
the
case.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
the
maximum
criminal
fine,
i
believe
is
$10,000,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
the
legislative
procedure
in
indiana
is
that
the
state
could
bring
a
civil
action
based
on
the
criminal
conviction
and
ask
for
remedy
in
excess
of
the
$10,000.
that,
your
honor,
we
think
is
reasonable
given
the
fact
that
the
court
had
an
option
between
$10,000
and
eight
years,
and
what
this
court
would
be
doing
if
it
were
to
suggest
that
the
forfeiture
is
unconstitutional
under
the
eighth
amendment
is
to
say
that
a
seizure
of
$50,000
or
$100,000
is
a
more
severe
penalty
than
the
eight
years.
and
we
think
it
would
not
restrict
expressive
material
to
take
a
million
dollar
operation...
we
haven't
even
had
a
chance
to
go
to
trial
to
show
the
factual
worth
of
the
defendant...
and
take
a
$50,000
or
$100,000
penalty,
we
may
have
a
much
less
restrictive
effect
on
expressive
rights
than
putting
the
owner
in
jail
for
eight
years.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
it's
different
in
that
under
a
fine
the
defendant
has
the
option
from
where
he
should
get
the
money.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
there
is
no
limit
in
terms
of
obscenity
or
narcotics
or
anything
else
to
rico
enforcement
nationally
or
at
the
state
level.
that's
correct.
that's
why,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
this
is
an
eighth
amendment
proportionality
issue
and
not
a
first
amendment
expressive
material
question.
if
this
does...
the
state's
position
is
that
we
need
to
begin
first
with
arcara
post-trial.
after
look
at
arcara
and
satisfy
ourselves
that
this
does
not
relate...
this
is
content-neutral,
does
not
relate
to
expressive
materials...
the
obscenity
is
a
predicate.
once
it's
found
to
be
obscene,
it's
the
same
as
drugs.
then
you
move...
that's
the
issue
one.
there's
an
expressive
issue
on
the
front
side.
on
the
back
side
are
the
sanctions.
the
sanctions,
it
is
our
position,
make
no
difference
whether
they
are
books
that
are
involved,
or
any
other
material
where
enforcing
is
sanctioned.
and
in
that
regard,
it's
either
arcara,
or
it
is
an
o'brien
test,
as
modified
by
albertini.
albertini
clearly
said
that
an
incidental
burden
on
speech
is
no
greater
than
is
essential
and,
therefore,
it's
permissible
under
o'brien
so
long
as
neutral
regulation
promotes
a
substantial
government
interest.
this
promotes
a
substantial
government
interest.
finally,
the
discussion
of
near
we
believe
also
is
misdirected.
in
that
case,
the
court
exactly
said
they
were
not
looking
at
the
permissible
scope
of
subsequent
punishment.
this
is
a
subsequent
punishment
case
and
not
a
prior
restraint
case.
once
there
is
a
conviction
for
obscenity,
it
is
a
subsequent
punishment
and
not
a
prior
restraint.
and
if
it
has
incidental
effect,
it
has
incidental
effect
under
the
o'brien
test
as
modified
by
albertini.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
there
are--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--that's
right.
and
in
that
case,
your
honor,
there
were
three
bookstores.
two
which
were
open--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--and
the
court
explicitly
allowed
them
to
stay
open
and
sell
their
books
and
didn't
interfere
at
all
because
they
were
ongoing
businesses.
the
third
store
was
not
open
yet
and
the
72-hour
order
was
that
they
come
into
court
before
they
opened
up.
the
object
of
the
indianapolis
pretrial
orders
was
to
maintain
the
status
quo
until
a
full
adversarial
hearing
72-hours
later.
i
would
submit
and
i
would
concede
that
rico
cannot
and
should
not
allow
ex
parte
closure
of
bookstores
absent
prior
convictions.
that
clearly
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
yes,
sir.
and
with
prior
convictions,
we
would
acknowledge
that
there
is
no
authority
from
this
court
directly
on
point
either
way.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
absolutely
not.
it
would
clearly
be
a
violation
of
their
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
clearly,
justice
scalia,
the
same
as
a
narcotics
case,
an
order
not
to
dissipate
assets
would
be
appropriate.
and
i
would
suggest,
in
modification
to
my
prior
answer,
if
there
were
some
allegation
that
the
assets
were
being
moved
to
europe,
that
it
might
be
proper
to
seize
them.
but
absent
a
suggestion
that
the
assets
are
to
flee,
an
order
not
to
dissipate,
which
was
the
indianapolis
order
not
to
dissipate...
the
reason
that
i'm
so
intent
on
that,
justice
scalia,
is
because
the
important
tool
here
is
the
post-trial
sanction
which
looks
just
like
any
other
penalty
after
trial
because
obscenity
does
not
have
any
first
amendment
expression.
and
this
remedy
is
content
neutral.
in
this
particular
case
it's
applied
to
a
bookstore.
but
if
it
were
applied
to
any
other
set
of
assets,
it
would
be
the
exact
same
discussion.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
i
think
that
the
indiana
supreme
court
held...
three
justices
held
that
in
the
fort
wayne
case
with
prior
convictions
there
could
be
a
pretrial
seizure.
yes,
sir.
one
of
the
chief
justices
dissented
on
the
fort
wayne
case.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
that's
correct.
there
is
no
holding.
and
i
think
that
what
we're
facing
here
is
if
the
court
is
troubled
by
the
facial
ex
parte
ability
of
the
indiana
law,
that
we
have
a
brockett
analysis
that
ought
to
be
made,
and
that
part
ought
to
be
severed
out.
but
it
should
not
affect
the
remedial
opportunities
of
federal
or
state
rico.
and
the
best
way
to
look
at
that
is
the
sappenfield
case.
it's
a
traditional
criminal
case
that
wants
to
go
to
trial
based
on
obscenities
as
the
predicate
and
enforce
a
sanction
at
the
other
end.
that
is
a
typical
rico
case
and
the
issue
of
ex
parte
seizure
at
the
front
end
shouldn't
affect
the
court's
sanctions
on
the
back
end
of
the
case.
it's
particularly
important
that
we
consider
this
case...
this
court
has
accepted
any
number
of
remedies
that
affect
expressive
materials
so
long
as
they
are
not
aimed
at
the
content
of
those
materials.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
absolutely.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
justice
kennedy,
i
acknowledge
that
this
has
a
powerful
deterrent
effect.
i'm
not
particularly
embarrassed
about
that.
i
don't
think
it
would
cause
people
to
stop
selling
books.
i
think
that
it
might
cause
persons
to
conform
their
sale
of
obscene
books
more
on
the
side
of
indecent
books.
but,
of
course,
that's
the
purpose
of
criminal
obscenity
laws.
it
is
to
deter
conduct.
and
i
think
that
what
we
have
before
the
court
today
is
an
acknowledgement
that
obscenity
is
a
powerful
source
of
funds
for
criminal
activities
and
that
we
have
a
sanction
that
is
equally
powerful.
and
if
the
state--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--your
honor,
it's
the
state's
position
that
obscenity
law
in
the
united
states
today
has
developed
to
such
a
hard-core
standard
and
is
so
clearly
understood
to
have
such
a
hard-core
standard
that
i
would
anticipate
that
it
would
have
a
deterrent
effect
on
legitimate
sale
and
expression
of
ideas.
and
that
would
not
be
the
case
because,
even
here,
there
has
to
be
a
conviction
for
the
obscenity
predicate.
and
we
don't
believe
that
it
would
have
a
chilling
effect,
but
rather
a
deterrent
effect,
on
people
who
are
involved
in
the
expression
of
ideas.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
well,
this
case
relates
not
to
the
content
of
the
materials.
but
this
case
does
not
come
into
being
until
there
is
a
finding
of
obscenity.
and
then
the
sanctions
are
in
place.
and
we
believe
that
that
differentiates
it
from
the
prior
rulings
of
this
court.
that's
why
we
think
it's
an
o'brien/albertini
case
if
it's
a
first
amendment
case
at
all.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
there
is
no
judgment
in
any
case
before
this
court
today.
there
is
a
ratification
by
the
indiana
supreme
court
of
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
rico
laws
which
would
allow
the
enforcement
of
sanctions
by
the
court.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
the
indiana
supreme
court's
opinion
applies
to
4447.
the
court
case
hasn't
yet
been
tried
because
it's--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--the
judgment
of
the
court
was
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
back
for
trial.
one
of
the
three...
just
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
import
of
the
sanctions
here,
one
of
the
three
stores
was
burned
down.
there
was
an
arson
conviction
in
federal
court.
and
under
federal
racketeering
law,
the
interests
of
that
person
in
these
other
stores
were
forfeited.
so,
we
have
a
closure
from
an
arson
as
a
predicate
that
really
parallels
what
we
would
see
from
obscenity
as
a
predicate.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
two.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
this
is
a
basic
racketeering
law.
it
requires
two
predicate
offenses.
the
predicate
offenses
have
to
be
obscenity.
it
could
be
one
book.
i
suppose
it
could
be
two
books
at
two
separate
times
that
were
sold.
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
or
it
could
be
two
murders
or
it
could
be
two
heroin--
mr.
stephen
goldsmith
--that's
right.
so,
the
conviction
or
judgment
for
those
offenses
would
throw
the
case
back
into
the
rico
analysis
if
there
was
a
common
enterprise.
and
what
we
really
have
here
is
not
a
draconian
response.
i
prefer
to
use
the
russello
analysis
that
we
have
new
weapons
of
unprecedented
scope
and
we're
dealing
with
an
organization
with
lots
of
money
and
so
they're
financial
remedies,
instead
of
the
traditional
criminal
remedies,
which
put
the
store
clerk
in
jail
for
a
number
of
years.
and
we
believe
that
these
remedies
post-trial,
at
least,
fall
within
traditional
first
amendment
and
eighth
amendment
literature.
and
if
they
have
an
incidental
effect
under
o'brien
and
albertini,
that
that
effect
is
constitutional.
and
deprive
the
right
of
the
state
to
use
its
sanctions
in
a
racketeering
law
essentially
and
when
it
involves
bookstores,
provides
a
safe
haven
behind
which
narcotics
dealers
can
buy
a
few
books
and
provide
a
facade
of
respectability.
we
believe
the
state's
sanctions
should
not
be
limited.
this
is
really
what
this
is;
it's
an
arcara
case
and
it's
not
a
first
amendment
case.
that
the
sanctions
which
ultimately
come
before
this
court,
need
to
be
judged
in
terms
of
eighth
amendment,
a
proportionality
law
as
applies
to
all
the
rico
laws.
thank
you
very
much.
