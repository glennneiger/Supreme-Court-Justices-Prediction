day
o'connor
mr.
weston,
did
any
of
the
respondents
or
the
defendants
in
the
sappenfield
case
even
indicate
with
us
an
interest
in
pursuing
the
case
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
none
of
the
parties
in
the
sappenfield
case,
4447
is
it?
corporation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
had
indicated
any
interest
in
pursuing
their
matter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
4447
case--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
anyone
here
at
all
on
that
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
mr.
weston,
i
understand
you
can
make
facial
challenges,
but
don't
your
facial
challenges
have
to
pertain
to
a
portion
of
the
statute
that's
been
applied
against
you?
as
i
understand
it,
some
elements
of
the
scheme
here
have
not
yet
been
applied
against
anybody,
in
particular
the
prohibition
against
an
individual's
engaging
in
the
same
business
again.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
wouldn't
know
what
remedies
in
fact
would
be
selected
or
used
by
the
court.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
items
forfeited
were
the
product
of
illegal
activity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
what
if...
what
if
under
the
state
rico
law,
let's
say,
the
predicate
offenses
are
dealing
in
narcotics
and
the
products
are
funnelled
into
a
bookstore?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
contents
of
the
bookstore--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
difference
does
it
make
if
the
predicate
offenses
are
obscenity
convictions
instead
of
drug,
narcotics
convictions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
required
for
what?
for
the
initial
pretrial
seizure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
we
reach
those
issues
in
connection
with
the
pretrial
seizure
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
just
seem
to
me
that
what
we
ought
to
address
is
what
happened
on
the
pretrial
seizure
and
possibly
the
question
of
the
predicate
offenses.
but
perhaps
the
full
range
of
penalties
after
a
conviction
just
isn't
a
final
judgment
and
properly
before
us.
now,
is
that
a
possibility
to
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
goldsmith,
do
you
also
defend
the
right
of
the
state
to
get
a
pretrial
seizure
without
any
hearing
pre
or
post-seizure
and
based
on
a
conclusory
affidavit
of
the
police
officer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
i
just
asked
if
that's
the
position
you
take.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
perfectly
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
concede
that
the
seizure
of
fort
wayne
books
and
the
stores
was
not
to
preserve
evidence
for
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
how
do
you
avoid
the
marcus
rule,
do
you
think?
why
doesn't
that
apply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
doesn't
it
apply?
