we'll
hear
argument
now
on
number
87-470
fort
wayne
books,
inc.
versus
indiana,
and
number
87-614,
sappenfield
versus
indiana.
mr.
weston,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
weston,
in
sappenfield
there
wasn't
any
seizure,
was
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
what
is
going
to
chill
people
about
simply
upholding
the
possibility
of
prosecuting
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
peddling
obscenity
is
not
presumptively
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nothing
happens
to
these
people
in
sappenfield
until
there
is
a
determination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
including
sappenfield
within
the
term
of
"these
cases"
presenting
egregious
violations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
you
shouldn't
use
the
term
"these
cases".
maybe
you
should
say
"this
case".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
weston,
supposing
a
drug
kingpin
were
laundering
his
money
in
a
chain
of
bookstores,
would
that
mean
that
those
bookstores
and
the
proceeds
were
not
subject
to
forfeiture
the
same
as
if
he
were
laundering
his
money
in
a
bunch
of
grocery
stores?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
if
predicate
conduct
is
obscenity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question,
mr.
weston.
your
time
has
expired.
we
will
hear
now
from
mr.
goldsmith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
agree
with
that.
i
thought
you
had
answered
justice
stevens
earlier...
that
it
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
if
there
were
a
conviction
on
the
predicate
offense,
this
sort
of
forfeiture
would
automatically
follow.
are
you
now
saying...
or,
at
least,
are
you
saying,
whether
you
said
something
different
before
or
not,
that
the
trial
court
has
discretion
to
determine
what
sort
of
a
penalty
along
those
lines
will
be
imposed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
this
statute
provide
for
fines?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
maximum
fine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
is
it
your
position
that
the
non-obscene
portion
of
the
books
sold
could
be
forfeited
even
though,
say,
they
were
of
a
value
of
$40,000
or
$50,000
as
a
result
of
a
successful
criminal
prosecution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
then
this
is
something
quite
different,
really,
from
saying
that
you're
fined
$10,000
and
these
books
are
attached
to
make
sure
that
you
pay
the
fine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
also
different
in
that
there
is
no
particular
monetary
limit
on
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldsmith.
the
case
is
submitted.
your
time
had
expired,
mr.
weston.
