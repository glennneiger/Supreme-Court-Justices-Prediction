justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
one
of
your
basic
positions
here
and
in
the
state
courts
was
that
if
books
are
involved,
you
just
can't
close
down
a
bookstore.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
aren't
you
claiming
that
even
if
you
could...
if
the
obscenity
convictions
are
the
predicate
crimes,
aren't
you
claiming
that
even
if
you
trace
the
proceeds
of
the
sales
from
obscenity...
if
you
can
trace
those
to
buying
more
books,
you
can't
seize
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
concede
that
they
can?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
you
could
answer
justice
stevens
what
your
position
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't...
wasn't
there
a
seizure
of
the
entire
store
before
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
based
on
just
probable
cause
to
believe
that
obscenity
was
being
sold
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
few
items
of
obscenity
being
sold
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
indicate
that
even
a
major
share
of
the
merchandise
in
the
store
were
obscene.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
thought...
i
thought
the
remedy
was
seizure
of
the
proceeds
of
the
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
if
they
are
derived
from
a
criminal
activity.
now,
suppose
there
is
only
one
book
that's
been
proved
obscene
and
sold.
now,
it's
awfully
hard
to
conclude
that
the
whole
store
full
of
books
and
the
real
estate
itself
is
derived
from
the
sale
of
one
book.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that's
a
state
statutory
construction
problem
in
the
first
instance,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
just
going
to
leave
it
up
in
the
air
on
the
pretrial
seizures
or
are
you
just
going
to
say
that
that's
a
difficult
question?
are
you
conceding
error?
in
the
fort
wayne
case
you
say
there
are
39
priors
that
had
already
been
adjudicated
and
you
save
the
pretrial
procedures
on
that
basis.
but
how
about
this
other
case
that
you
say
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
i'm
not
sure
it
is,
but
if
it
is,
there
weren't
39
priors
in
those
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
absent
prior
convictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know,
in
a
rico
case
like
this
were
you
allege
but
haven't
yet
proved
three
obscenity
violations,
you
would
say
that
until
the
actual
case
is
tried
out
you
cannot
seize
or
close
down
the
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
that
your
state
supreme
court
held
that
you
could
have
a
pretrial
seizure
of
the
bookstore
just
based
on
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
no
holding
that...
there
is
no
holding
that
just
on
probable
cause
you
could
have
a
pretrial
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
small
point.
there's
been
a
final
judgment
that
pending
trial
in
the
fort
wayne
case
that
the
stores
may
be
closed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that's
permissible
because
there
were
39
prior
convictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
case
is
really
two
cases
number
87-470
fort
wayne
books,
inc.
against
indiana
is
here
form
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
and
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
in
this
case.
the
other
case
is
number
87-614
sathenfield
against
indiana,
also
here
in
the
same
court.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
in
this
case.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dessenting
in
part.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
descenting
in
number
87-614,
and
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
number
87-470
in
which
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall
joined.
