justice
antonin
scalia
nobody
has
been
subjected
to
that.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
that
was
before
the
indiana
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
both
of
these
cases
that
are
up
here
there
was
a
prayer
to
enjoin
the
parties
from
engaging
in
the
business
in
the
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
use
that...
you
can't
lose
that
right
even
by
virtue
of
something
other
than
speaking.
i
mean,
i
supposed
you
can't
make
it
a
penalty
for
a
narcotics
trafficking
that
you
can't
make
speeches
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
so
what
the
problem
is
is
the
remedy
and
not
the
crime
that
invokes
the
remedy.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
don't
understand.
let's
assume
that
all
of
these
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
non-obscene
materials
add
up
to
a
million
dollars.
you're
saying
you
can't
do
that
because
that
million
dollars
didn't
come
from
the
obscene
sales.
but
you
acknowledge
that
you
can
impose
a
fine
of
a
million
dollars.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
difference
whether
you
call
it
one
or
call
it
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let
me
ask
one
other
question
before
you
go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
line
between
proceeds
and
non-proceeds.
that
isn't
a
line
that's
adopted
in
the
federal
rico
statute
either,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal
rico
statute
does
not
require
that
it
be
derived
from
proceeds
of
the
unlawful--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
have
to
have
an
obscene
character.
we're
punishing
you
by
taking
away
from
you.
just
as
we're
punishing
you
by
making
you
pay
a
million
dollars.
it's
not
that
the
million
dollars
is
obscene
or
that
there
is
anything
evil
about
the
million
dollars.
but
that's
just
the
punishment
we've
selected.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
case
just
got
here
on
its
own?
no--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
we
granted
it
improvidently
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
recall
that
we've
ever
let
one
side
beat
up
on
another
who
is
not
even
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
getting
me
confused
now.
i
thought
you
said
before
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be...
i
thought
you
said
earlier
it
doesn't
have
to
be
proceeds
derived
from
the
obscenity.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
that.
but
just
now
you've
said
it
has
to
be
derived
from.
what
are
we
talking
about?
how
does
the
indiana
statute
work?
is
it
necessary
that
there
be
a
derivation
from...
derived
from
the
proceeds
of
the
unlawful
activity
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
nexus?
it's
enough
that
you
sold
it
in
the
same
business?
is
that
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
would
allow
an
order
preventing
the
wasting
of
assets?
