mr.
john
m
weston
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
recently
in
hustler
magazine
versus
falwell,
this
court
reaffirmed
the
need
to
give
adequate
breathing
space
to
first
amendment
freedoms
in
order
to
protect
them.
these
cases
before
the
court
this
afternoon
raise
an
essential
element
of
that
protection,
the
right
to
be
wrong.
today's
cases
involve
book
stores,
but
this
court's
decision
will
unquestionably
touch
and
affect
newspapers,
publishers,
the
motion
picture
industry,
television
and
radio
broadcasters
and
religious
and
political
organizations.
in
short,
anyone
or
anything
who
or
which
engages
in
conduct
presumptively
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
ultimately,
its
greatest
impact
will
be
on
the
american
public's
right
to
receive
vast
quantities
of
protected
expression.
if
these
statutes
are
sustained,
the
protective
bulwarks
surrounding
first
amendment
freedom
so
painstakingly
crafted
by
this
court
will
crumble.
affirming
the
judgments
below
would
eviscerate
the
longstanding
prior
restraint
and
chilling
effect
doctrines--
mr.
john
m
weston
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m
weston
but
in
sappenfield,
your
honor,
although
it
was
brought
pursuant
to
the
indiana
criminal
rico
statute,
the
civil
rico
statute
is
a
direct
adjunct
of
that
and
given
the
collateral
estoppel
provisions
of
civil
procedure,
forfeiture
and
subsequent
restraint
and
so
forth
are
automatic
upon
conviction.
the
chilling
effect
regarding
the
sappenfield
statute
which
has
been
discussed
and
which
we
will
discuss,
involves
the
facial
presence
of
the
potential
enormously
high
jail
sentence
in
connection
with
engaging
in
conduct,
a
presumptively
protected
by
the
first
amendment--
mr.
john
m
weston
--no.
of
course,
your
honor.
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
but
speech,
up
until
the
moment
it
is
determined
to
be
obscene,
is
surely
protected
by--
mr.
john
m
weston
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
except
to
the
extent
that
someone
like
sappenfield,
a
book
seller,
or
someone
in
another
endeavor
subject
to
the
possible
application
of
obscenity
law
faced
with
the
draconian
potential
sanction
of
eight
years
in
a
criminal
jail
sentence
for
violation
of
the
statute,
which
at
best
is
inelastic
with
a
limited
scienter
standard,
will
certainly
think
more
than
twice
before
electing
to
deal
with
sexually
oriented
material.
mr.
john
m
weston
that
question,
of
course,
your
honor,
is
not
specifically
before
the
court,
but
certainly
raises
in--
mr.
john
m
weston
--a
similar
one.
although,
quite
frankly,
under
the
indiana
rico
statute,
particularly
in
light
of
the
semantical
complication
of
the
traditional
rico
language
and
some
greater
elastic
language
under
the
scope
provisions
of
the
statute,
there
is
probably
a
broader
reach
and
a
greater
vagueness
problem
that
might
attend
the
usual
miller
standard.
but,
to
deal
with
the
court's
question,
justice
white,
you're
quite
correct.
that
the
argument
that
we
make
with
respect
to
the
potential
chilling
effect
of
high
penalties
is
one
which
would
be
equally
applicable
to
a
general
obscenity
statute.
mr.
john
m
weston
we
have
final
judgments,
your
honor,
with
respect...
justice
blackmun,
to
the
issues
raised
in
the
courts
below.
that
is
to
say,
that
the
indiana
supreme
court
considered
and
approved
in
a
final
judgment
all
of
the
pretrial
sanctions
which
were
utilized
and
available,
all
of
the
post-trial
sanctions
which
were
the
basis
anticipatorily
for
the
pretrial
sanctions,
and
also
the
principle
that
conduct
at
one
bookstore
in
a
chain
may
be
visited
in
terms
of
effect
on
other
bookstores
in
the
chain.
with
respect
to
sappenfield
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
challenges
to
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
criminal
rico
statute
had
been
made
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
appellate
courts
and
they
were
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
rather
brief
opinion
based
on
the
fort
wayne
decision
in
the
indiana
supreme
court.
so,
under
this
court's
decisions,
the
matters
were
certainly
rendered
to
the
highest
courts
in
the
state
to
consider
them,
were
decided
by
those
courts,
and
in
terms
of
the
overriding
federal
interest
at
stake
here,
would
not
be
aided
by
remanding
the
causes
to
trial
where
further
proceedings
might
occur
which
would
prevent
those
issues
from--
mr.
john
m
weston
--i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
o'connor.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
missing
your
point.
mr.
john
m
weston
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon--
mr.
john
m
weston
--not
in
sappenfield,
justice
o'connor.
there
are
theoretically
three
cases
before
the
court.
mr.
john
m
weston
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m
weston
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
no
defendant
below
in
the
4447
has
filed
a
direct
appearance
in
this
court.
an
individual
who
was
named
as
a
defendant,
burk
mendenhall
did
file
an
amicus
brief
in
this
court
in
this
cause
but
is
not
a
direct
party.
mr.
john
m
weston
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
m
weston
no
one
has
been
subjected
to
it
except
the
complaint
which
remains
in
the
fort
wayne
case
retains
that
prayer.
the
indiana
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
all
of
the
available
sanctions
under
the
statute
were
constitutional,
raising
no
first
amendment
questions
in
specific
rejection
of
the
opinion
which
invalidated
the
entire
statute
on
its
face
with
specific
focus
on
those
remedies
rendered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
as
well,
in
the
original
4447
case,
which
as
justice
o'connor
points
out,
is
not
really
before
the
court,
the
original
complaint
sought
the
general
injunctive
remedies.
although
there
was
an
amended
complaint
filed
four
or
five
weeks
later
which
abandoned
that
request.
but
the
indiana
supreme
court,
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
has
clearly
upheld
the
full
panoply
of
remedies
as
against
specific
lower
court
judges.
mr.
john
m
weston
absolutely.
without
question.
mr.
john
m
weston
not
in
sappenfield,
which
was
exclusively
a
criminal
prosecution
with
none
of
the
injunctive
or
civil
type
remedial
provisions
available.
however,
in
fort
wayne,
unquestionably
the
complaint
sought
such
a
remedy.
it
is
live.
it
is
part
of
the
complaint.
the
original
4447
complaint,
subsequently
amended
to
omit
it,
did
include
that,
and
the
indiana
supreme
court
specifically
approved
all
of
the
panoply
of
remedies
available
under
the
statute.
again,
if
i
just
may
finish
the
point,
in
sappenfield
it
is
automatic
that
following
conviction,
should
one
occur,
there
will
be
a
civil
forfeiture
and
the
entire...
and
under
collateral
estoppel
principles,
nothing
can
be
raised
by
the
defendant
and
there
will
automatically
be
full
forfeiture
with
the
full
panoply
of
the
remedies,
at
least
if
nothing
is
disturbed
in
light
of
the--
mr.
john
m
weston
--i
suppose
that's
true,
except
to
the
extent
that
under
the
indiana
court...
under
the
indiana
statute
forfeiture
is
mandatory
subsequent
to
in
essence
a
conviction
or--
mr.
john
m
weston
--oh,
no,
justice
o'connor.
quite
much
more
broadly
so.
one
would
have
hoped
that
that
would
have
been
the
ruling.
but
it's
very,
very
clear.
and
i
might
add
that
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
in
arizona,
in
arizona
versus
feld,
so
construed
and
limited
its
rico
obscenity
predicated
statute
to
limit
only
specific
proceeds
attributable
to
materials
found
to
be
obscene
in
appropriate
litigation.
it's
very
clear,
both
in--
mr.
john
m
weston
--oh,
well,
there's
certainly
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
m
weston
of
course,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
m
weston
and
really
that's
like...
that's
the
arcara
type
situation
in
a
way
because
there
there
would
have
been
no
speech
conduct,
no
expressive
conduct
at
all
as
the
predicate
offense.
whatever
proceeds
flowed
from
that
would
certainly
be
subject
to
scrutiny
under
legislation
which
already
exists.
mr.
john
m
weston
well,
as
i
thought
your
concurring
opinion
made
clear
in
arcara,
justice
o'connor,
that
where
the
predicate
conduct
was
expressive,
then,
of
course,
a
full
first
amendment
standard
of
review
would
be
required
in
order,
aside
from
all
the
obvious
reasons,
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
interference
with
speech
based
on
a
desire
to
thwart
the
speech.
mr.
john
m
weston
no.
one
would
think
not
only
for
the
initial
pretrial
seizure,
but
for
an
examination
of
what
the
available
post-trial
remedies
might
be.
for
example,
by
the
time
arcara
reached
this
court,
it
was
certainly
in
the
position
of
a
post-trial
situation
after
the
full
order
had
been
issued
with
the
court
examining
the
question.
so,
if
the
first
amendment
concepts
have
any
meaning
whatsoever,
if
the
principle
of
near
versus
minnesota
and
citizens
for
a
better
austin
versus
keefe
have
any
meaning
what
those
unbroken...
what
that
unbroken
line
of
cases
tells
us...
and,
of
course,
there
are
almost
no
examples
challenging
it.
mr.
john
m
weston
no,
not
at
all,
justice.
mr.
john
m
weston
they
are
not,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
formal
notice,
when
fort
wayne
books
filed
its
petition
for
certiorari,
it
was
required
to
give
notice
to
those
individuals,
which
we
did.
there
has
been
no
response...
in
individuals
and
corporations...
there
has
been
no
response
with
respect
to
those
individuals
asking
to
be
litigants
before
this
honorable
court.
mr.
john
m
weston
that
is
the
position
that...
certainly
with
respect
to
my
representation,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m
weston
if
the
principles
of
prior
restraint,
if
the
principles
of
near
and
austin
have
any
significance,
they
represent
a
basic
governing
concept
which
has
ennobled
this
country's
history
almost
from
the
beginning.
and
that
is
that
one
may
not
lose
one's
right
to
speak
by
virtue
of
speaking.
that
if
books
or
magazines
or
films,
or
any
other...
or
newspapers,
or
any
other
expressive
entity
or
matter
is
going
to
be
suppressed,
it
must
be
so
only
by
virtue
of
its
own
validity
or
invalidity.
mr.
john
m
weston
i
would
agree,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
m
weston
certainly
at
a
major
level,
absolutely.
the
remedy,
of
course,
in
these
situations,
as
was
first
articulated
in
near
is
absolutely
inappropriate
regardless
of
whatever
the
determination
may
be
with
respect
to
the
predicate
offense.
the
question
with
respect
to
whether
obscenity
may
still
be
criminalized
or
rendered
illegal
is
not
necessarily
before
this
court
in
terms
of
the
questions
we
raised.
the
court
is
quite
correct.
certainly
with
respect
to
the
civil
rico
statute,
the
biggest
concern
expressed
is
indeed
with
the
remedy.
but,
nonetheless...
or,
to
follow
along
with
the
same
concept,
these
cases
present
what
must
be
the
most
egregious
violations
of
prior
restraint.
and
when
i
say
these
cases,
particularly
with
respect
to
fort
wayne
books
and
the
facts
which
i
guess
are
not
formally
before
the
court
in
the--
mr.
john
m
weston
--no,
your
honor,
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
cut
back
from
to
make--
mr.
john
m
weston
--that
would
be
a
better
approach,
mr.
chief
justice.
yes.
thank
you.
with
respect
to
the
forfeiture
provisions,
the
cases
which
raised
the
forfeiture
provisions,
they
appear
to
present
the
most
egregious
violations
of
the
near
principles
and
the
prior
restraint
principles
based
on
expressive
conduct
challenged
by
the
state,
vis-a-vis
virtually
unlimited
examples
of
unlitigated,
unchallenged
other
books,
magazines,
films,
and
the
opportunity
to
express
other
sorts
of--
mr.
john
m
weston
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
no
question.
mr.
john
m
weston
it
would
depend,
it
seems
to
me,
on
what
funds
were
utilized
in
order
to
justify
the
seizure.
mr.
john
m
weston
would
the
funds,
however,
that
were
utilized--
mr.
john
m
weston
--is
this
in
terms
of
a
proceeds
tracing
statute
or
some
sort
of
contagion?
mr.
john
m
weston
it
would
appear--
mr.
john
m
weston
--if
there
were
six
books,
six
books
alleged
to
be
obscene,
found
to
be
obscene,
generated
a
certain
sum
of
money,
that
money,
under
procedural
safeguards,
could
be
traced
and
utilized
to
forfeit
either
that
sum
or
that
which
they
had
acquired.
mr.
john
m
weston
it
would
appear
to
be,
under
appropriate
procedural
safeguards
such
that
only
proceeds
from
materials
specifically
found,
specifically
delineated,
challenged,
and
judicially
determined
to
be
obscene--
mr.
john
m
weston
--again,
under
appropriate
procedural
safeguards
there
is
no
necessary
first
amendment
barrier
to
tracing
funds
from
specifically
delineated
materials
found
to
be
obscene
which
generated
those
proceeds.
the
problem
with
the
hypothetical
which
your
honor
proposed
is
that
if
there
were
a
hundred
books
in
the
store,
six
were
alleged
to
be
obscene,
six
were
found
to
be
obscene,
and
the
proceeds
from
those
six
books
resulted
in
$15.00,
it
would
be
a
first
amendment
violation
to
attempt
to
interdict
or
forfeit,
or
do
to
anything
with
the
proceeds
from
materials
not
found
to
be
obscene.
and
that
was
why
i
asked--
mr.
john
m
weston
--your
former
brother
on
the
ninth
circuit,
judge
kozinski,
of
course,
in
busher
has
raised
a
proportionality
question
in
terms
of
other
circumstances.
but
i
would
like
to
direct
our
own
focus
this
afternoon
to
the
first
amendment
consideration.
mr.
john
m
weston
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
with
respect
to
obscenity
we
are...
and
perhaps
i
did
not
make
myself
clear,
but
we're
not
questioning
under
appropriate
procedural
safeguards
the
ability
to
track
proceeds
from
material
specifically
determined
to
be
obscene.
what
we
object
to
and
what
it
appears
that
the
court's
decisions
have
prohibited,
is
the
use
of
funds
from
materials
not
determined
to
be
obscene
to
be
forfeited
because
other
materials
have
been
determined
to
be
obscene
and
their
proceeds
may
be
subject
to
forfeit.
mr.
john
m
weston
well,
we
acknowledge--
mr.
john
m
weston
--we
acknowledge
that
a
fine
may
statutorily
be
authorized.
we
certainly
do
not
acquiesce
in
the
notion
and
light
of
the
potential
first
amendment
challenge
to
such
high
fines
on
the
same
basis
that
the
chilling
effect
would
arguably
invalidate
the
potential
for
a
high
jail
sentence
under
the
present
state
of
the
miller
test
and
the
limited
scienter
standard.
with
respect,
also,
justice
scalia,
to
the
possibility
of
a
high
fine,
at
least
it's
subject
to
analysis.
in
other
words,
that
the
high
fine
will
not
necessarily
be
applied,
it
may
be
examined.
and
to
the
extent,
even
under
traditional
sentencing
criteria,
that
it
may
have
the
impact
of
closing
down
a
business,
it
in
itself
is
subject
to
reduction
or
first
amendment
scrutiny.
not
terribly
different
from
the
notion
that
some
courts
have
begun
to
apply
in
terms
of
punitive
damages
in
defamation
cases,
for
example,
or
invasion
of
privacy
cases
where
to
do
so
would
tend
to
close
the
business.
but
there
is
another
limited--
mr.
john
m
weston
--sure.
mr.
john
m
weston
not
at
all.
mr.
john
m
weston
it's
unclear.
in
the
one
case...
the
one
federal
case
which
discussed
this
issue,
united
states
versus
priva,
the
prejudgment
opinion
of
the
court
appears
to
limit
the
reach
of
the
forfeiture
to
proceeds
from
materials
determined
to
be
obscene.
subsequently,
at
the
time
of
forfeiture,
however,
it
became
very
clear
that
the
court's
interpretation
had
changed
and
the
statute
was
applied
to
reach
the
entire
panoply...
or,
the
entirety
of
the
assets.
but,
really,
not
so
much
on
a
proceed
tracking
theory
as
much
as
an
equally
impermissible
contagion
theory.
somehow
that
a
book
on
a
shelf
presumptively
protected,
never
alleged
to
be
obscene,
somehow
acquires
an
obscene
character
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it's
neighbor
was
alleged
to
be
obscene
and
determined
to
be
obscene.
mr.
john
m
weston
well,
let
me
suggest,
with
respect
to
that
possibility.
certainly
in
times
versus
sullivan
this
court
considered
a
relatively
similar
potential
application
of
the
same
doctrine.
a
very
large
series
of
state
judgments
for
expression
deemed
to
be
unprotected.
the
court
viewed
the
potential
possibility
and
concluded
clearly
that
in
terms
of
the
potential
for
chilling
effect
and
the
harm
to
publication
and
to
first
amendment
interest,
the
unrestricted
potential
for
imposing
that
kind
of
damage
award
required
a
higher
scienter
standard.
and
such
was
imposed,
and
that
was
the
way
the
chill
was
dissipated.
the
circumstance
that
we
face
here,
obviously
with
an
equally
low
scienter
standard,
or
perhaps
even
a
lower
one
and
a
more
difficult
to
apply
definition
for
the
alleged
wrongdoing
may
also
require
a
heightened
standard.
my
point
being
not
that
that
necessarily
answers
the
question
of
why
a
fine
is
okay
and
something
else
is
not,
but
simply
that
the
court
will
not
cast
a
blind
eye
to
what
the
realities
are
of
the
circumstance.
i
would
also
point
out
with
respect
to
what
the
social
interests
are
involved
that
it
is
not
only
the
interests
of
the
book
seller
that
is
being
protected,
but
what
is
protected
in
this
circumstance
is
the
reciprocal
right
of
the
public
to
be
able
to
receive
presumptively
protected
material.
and
the
notion
of
simply
forfeiting
unlitigated
material
removes
such
material
from
the
public.
on
the
one
hand,
it
might
be
an
acceptable
slap
at
the...
when
i
say
acceptable,
from
the
point
of,
say,
law
enforcement...
an
acceptable
slap
at
the
individual
who
is
the
seller,
but
it
would
be
inevitably
the
public
that
would
be
the
loser.
mr.
john
m
weston
no.
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
as
i
thought
i
had
explained
to
justice
o'connor.
the
predicate
conduct
is
what
makes
the
significant
difference.
if
the
predicate
conduct
is
not
expressive,
is
not
speech,
then
what
is
generated
from
that
conduct
may
be,
under
appropriate
procedural
safeguards,
tracked
and
dealt
with
as
appropriate.
mr.
john
m
weston
and
we
have
indicated
that
to
the
extent
that
the
predicate
conduct
is
obscenity,
that
with,
again,
appropriate
protections,
the
material
may
be
prosecuted,
the
material
may
be
subject
to
scrutiny,
and
proceeds
from
the
specific
materials
are
subject
to
tracing
and
ultimate
forfeiture.
what
has
been
done
in
these
cases
is
simply
to
deal
with
it
as
if
it
were
contagious.
and
to
forfeit
unlitigated
materials
and
assets
from
presumptively
protected
unchallenged
materials
and
simply
forfeit
them
by
virtue
of
their
being
on
the
same
premises.
mr.
john
m
weston
under
the
indiana
supreme
court
opinion,
it
appears,
your
honor,
very
clear
that
they
could
do
so.
and
one
of
the
judges--
mr.
john
m
weston
--yes,
justice
stevens.
unquestionably
because
that
issue
was
before
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
when
i
argued
the
cause
before
the
indiana
supreme
court
i
made
that
point.
that
in
the
indiana
situation
there
were
eight
items
alleged
to
be
obscene
with
a
possible
value
of
something
like
$200.
i'm
just
guessing.
the
material
that
was
sequestered
and
held
in
the
closed
bookstore
in
indianapolis
exceeded
that
sum
by
exponential
figures.
it
was
very
clear
what
the
theory
of
the
state
was
in
an
oral
argument
and
in
every
position
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
that
it
didn't
matter
what
was
in
the
bookstore,
it
didn't
matter
what
was
present
or
what
proportion,
if
there
was
any
proof
exclusively
of
this
racketeering
concept
being
defined
specifically
as
two
examples
of
inappropriate
conduct,
that
would
answer
the
question.
that
everything
was
then
subject
to
forfeiture.
mr.
john
m
weston
two
missteps.
mr.
john
m
weston
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
both
in
indianapolis
and
fort
wayne.
in
indianapolis
there
had
been
no
prior
convictions.
there
were
allegations
at
each
of
two
stores
that
there
had
been
four
materials
offered
for
sale
which
were
alleged
to
be
obscene.
on
the
basis
of
that,
a
third
store
about
to
be
opened...
never
opened,
never
sold
an
item...
was
closed
by
virtue
of
its
alleged
involvement
with
the
other
two.
in
fort
wayne,
on
the
basis
of
39
alleged
examples
of
obscenity,
three
stores
were
closed.
and
i
simply
suggest
that
this
is
not
speculative.
those
stores
were
closed
for
13
months.
mr.
john
m
weston
well,
the
pretrial
seizure,
justice--
mr.
john
m
weston
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
although
i
understand
in
terms
of
certain
principles
of
jurisprudence
of
course
why
the
question
would
be
asked.
but
the
issue
was
clearly
before
the
indiana
supreme
court.
the
court
of
appeals
went
through
the
potential
parade
or
horrors
and
struck
down
the
statute
or
its
face,
in
its
entirety,
for
just
those
reasons.
and
the
indiana
supreme
court
rejected
it
and
in
essence
rejected
your
concurring
opinion
in
arcara
saying
that
there
was
absolutely
no
necessity
of
applying
any
first
amendment
analysis
here
and
end
of
the
question.
and
simply
said
that
the
full
range
of
rico
penalties
is
perfectly
appropriate
here,
no
different
whether
these
materials
are
books
or
groceries
or
widgets.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
at
this
juncture,
given
the
final
judgment
of
the
indiana
supreme
court,
there
is
no
appropriate
basis
for
maintaining
the...
for
staying
this
court's
scrutiny
and
hopefully
its
hand.
i
would
suggest,
in
concluding,
with
respect
to
the
parallel
to
the
near
versus
minnesota
situation
and
the
inapplicability
of
rico
because
it's
very
clear
that
this
court
has
maintained
that
in
prior
restraint
cases
the
operation
and
effect
of
the
legislation
and
of
the
procedures
would
be
looked
at.
and
the
indiana
supreme
court
was
very
clear,
as
was
mr.
goldsmith
in
his
brief,
that
the
basic
purpose
of
rico
was
remedial
in
order
to
deal
with
a
perceived
evil,
in
order
to
stop
a
particular
kind
of
conduct.
and
the
remedy
sought
under
the
rico
statute
is
clearly
not
simply
punishment
for
subsequent
activities,
but,
instead,
broadly
remedial
to
eliminate
a
particular
kind
of
undefined
conduct
prospectively.
and
i
think--
mr.
john
m
weston
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and,
certainly,
our
constitutional
position,
although
the
indiana
supreme
court
rejected
its--
mr.
john
m
weston
--no.
no,
your
honor.
under--
mr.
john
m
weston
--yes,
your
honor.
under
appropriate
procedural--
--well,
that
isn't
what
you...
i
don't...
i
thought
you
were
arguing...
or,
some
people
in
this
case
are
arguing
that
you
cannot
seize
a
bookstore
even
if
you
can
trace
it.
not
seize
a
bookstore,
your
honor,
but
seize
the
particular
books.
if...
i
thought...
when
justice
rehnquist
inquired...
chief
justice
rehnquist
inquired
if,
say,
there
were
drug
sales--
mr.
john
m
weston
--proceeds
from
drugs,
that
sales
from
the
drugs
had
bought
the
new
york
times,
could
the
new
york
times
be
forfeited
with
appropriate
procedural
safeguards?
mr.
john
m
weston
of
course.
and
i
think
we're
not
disputing
that
possibility,
if
there
are
specifically
identified
obscene
books.
if
those
books
are
properly,
under
appropriate
standards,
tried,
found
to
be
obscene,
the
$97.00
that
flow
from
those
books
may
be
traced.
if
they
bought
$97.00
worth
of
books,
it
may
be
suppressed
or
forfeited.
if
they
bought
some
drapes
or
a
videotape
on
how
to
play
golf,
that
may
be
suppressed.
but
what
may
not
be
done
is
that
because
$97.00
worth
of
books
were
sold,
the
entire
bookstore
closed.
mr.
john
m
weston
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
m
weston
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
