justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
counsel,
of
course,
if
you
sentence
someone
to
jail
for
ten
years,
his
or
her
speech
is
chilled
during
that
time.
it's
more
difficult
to
speak
when
you're
in
jail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
this
case,
focusing
just
on
the
pre...
on
the
post-adjudication
seizure
for
the
moment,
suppose
that
a
bookstore
is
engaged
in
selling
other
items
too
and
just
those
other
items
are
seized.
or
a
grocery
store
is
selling
a
few
books
and
all
the
grocery
assets
are
seized.
is
that
a
prior
restraint
after
an
adjudication
of
obscenity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
they're
within
the
statute.
their
proceeds
did
derive
from
the
operation,
and
you
seized
all
of
the
operation
other
than
the
books.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
under
this
statute
after
an
adjudication
of
sales
of
obscenity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
show
that
the
proceeds
are
derived
from
the
operation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
consistent
with
the
first
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now,
suppose,
to
take
it
the
next
step,
the
purchase
is
for
more
books.
could
the
books
be
seized?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
first
amendment
violation
only?
so
that
if
it's
a
drug
case,
i
assume
you
can
seize
all
the
assets?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
have
to
explain
why
the
first
amendment
is
the
limiting
principle.
if
this
statute
is
permissible
as
to
contraband
other
than
speech
or
alleged
speech,
why
can't
it
be
applied
to
obscenity
after
an
adjudication?
because
obscenity,
as
we
know,
is
not
protected
speech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
sustain
the
statute,
it
has
a
strong
deterrent
effect
on
your
state,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
you
think
in
candor
that
some
businesses
which
sell
books
as
just
part
of
their
inventory
might
give
up
that
line
of
inventory
just
to
keep
well
clear
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
are
you
completely
confident
that
the
deterrent
is
not
so
strong
that
indecent
but
non-obscene
expression
is
not
going
to
be
affected?
