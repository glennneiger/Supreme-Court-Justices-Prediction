justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
weston,
is
it
clear
that
that
remedy
would
be
entered
at
the
end
of
a
proceeding?
i
didn't
read
the
indiana
supreme
court
necessarily
going
that
far.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
disgorging
assets
acquired
through
racketeering
activity.
and
if
you
have,
say,
ten
percent
of
the
bookstore's
inventory
is
obscene
and
90
percent
is
non-obscene,
and,
say,
they
could
prove
that
90
percent
of
the
assets
were
perfectly
lawful
and
not
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
ten
percent,
are
you
sure
they
could
forfeit
the
whole
bookstore?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
appears
they
could
ask
for
a
remedy.
i'm
not
so
sure.
this,
perhaps,
goes
to
the
question
of
finality
too.
you
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
under
the
statute
if
they
prevail
and
prove
that
anything
in
the
store
is
obscene
that
the
remedy
automatically
will
follow
and
that
they
can
seize
the
entire
inventory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
court
says,
"it
cannot
be
presumed
that
prosecutorial
discretion
will
be
abused
to
the
extent
of
threatening
the
continued
existence
of
bookstores
and
theaters.
"
i
thought
they
weren't
necessarily
meaning
that
one
misstep
in
a
bookstore
and
the
whole
store
is
automatically
closed.
do
you
read
it
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
missteps.
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goldsmith,
will
you
help
me
with
the
issues
a
little
bit.
your
opponent
agrees
they
can
be
applied...
the
sanctions
can
be
applied
to
first
amendment
materials
if
they
are
traced
to
show
they
are
proceeds
of
the
violations.
so,
we
don't...
everybody
agrees
they
can
be
applied
to
first
amendment
issues.
that
much
is
clear,
is
it
not?
i
just
heard
him
say
that
a
few
minutes
ago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
right.
your
position
is...
and
is
he
correct?
do
you
agree
with
his
statement
of
your
position,
that
you're
saying
that
if
in
a
bookstore
two
obscene
books
are
sold,
automatically
you
can
seize
the
entire
inventory?
yes
or
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
it
happen
under
your
statute?
well,
it
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i'm
not
asking
you
about
its
constitutionality.
i'm
asking
you
about
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
if
the
statute
is
applied
as
it's
been
construed
by
the
indiana
supreme
court,
could
you,
as
the
prosecutor,
say
to
the
judge,
"we
have
proved
that
three
books
were
obscene
in
this
store.
"
"kindly
enter
an
order
closing
the
entire
store
and
forfeiting
the
entire
inventory?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
all
you've
proved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
you
be
entitled
to
it
under
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
only
objections
to
that
relief
would
be
constitutional
objections?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
three
books
were
obscene
and
they
were
sold
in
a
particular
store
and
the
rest
of
the
store
was
filled
with
nothing
but
charles
dickens
and
william
shakespeare?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but,
mr.
goldsmith,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
you
have
two
ways
of
describing
the
term
criminal
activity.
the
two
obscene
sales
are
one
form
of
criminal
activity.
but
they
also,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
make
the
entire
enterprise
in
which
those
books
were
sold
a
criminal
enterprise
and
an
unlawful
activity,
under
your
rico
statute.
so,
if
the
bookstore
has
sold
two
or
three
obscene
books,
it
becomes,
in
its
entirety,
a
criminal
activity.
isn't
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
therefore,
everything
in
the
store
is
automatically
subject
to
forfeiture
because
the
whole
store
is
a
criminal
activity
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
two
obscene
books
were
sold
there.
isn't
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
can
there
be
a
proportionality
problem
if
under
the
rico
statute
the
pattern
of
activity
is
satisfied
by
the
sales
of
two
or
three
items
which
are
part
of
the
ongoing
business?
then
the
whole
business
is
a
criminal
enterprise.
isn't
that...
that's
the
way
rico
works
i
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
want
to
get
one
small
point
on
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
predicate
of...
you
have
to
have...
what
is
it,
two
or
three?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
two
sales
of
the
same
book
or
does
it
have
to
be
two
different
books?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
could
be
the
same
book
on
monday
and
then
another
copy
of
that
book
on
tuesday?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but
i'm
just
asking
you
a
question
about
this.
