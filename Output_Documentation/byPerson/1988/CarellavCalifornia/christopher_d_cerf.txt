mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
appellant
was
convicted
of
grand
theft
after
failing
to
return
a
rental
car
by
the
date
set
out
in
the
rental
agreement.
the
question
presented
is
whether
two
california
statutes
pursuant
to
which
the
jury
was
instructed
to
presume
commission
of
the
offense
from
proof
of
certain
predicate
facts
deprived
him
of
due
process
of
law.
it
is
our
position,
as
the
state
of
california
now
concedes,
that
these
instructions
violated
the
bedrock
due
process
principal
that
the
prosecution
must
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
facts
of
the
case
can
be
summarized
very
briefly.
appellant
rented
a
car
from
a
los
angeles
rental
agency
on
march
25th,
1985,
left
a
substantial
deposit
and
agreed
to
return
it
by
may
3rd
of
that
year.
when
the
car
was
not
returned
by
that
date,
the
rental
agency
made
several
efforts
to
contact
him
and
eventually
reported
the
car
as
stolen.
appellant
was
arrested
on
june
27th,
1985,
and
the
car
was
found
that
same
day
in
the
parking
lot
adjoining
the
business
address
he
had
provided
at
the
time
he
rented
the
car.
he
was
charged
with
two
offenses
under
the
california
code.
he
was
charged
with
grand
theft
and
a
related
offense
under
the
vehicle
code.
at
the
close
of
the
evidence,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
grand
theft
required
an
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
permanent
possession;
that
a
conviction
under
the
lesser
offense
would
be
authorized
even
if
temporary
deprivation
was
intended;
and
that
embezzlement
was
a
form
of
grand
theft.
in
addition,
over
appellant's
objection,
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
on
two
statutory
presumptions
at
issue
in
this
appeal.
the
jury
was
told
first
that
whenever
a
person
intentionally
and
wilfully
keeps
a
rental
car
more
than
five
days
beyond
the
expiration
of
the
rental
agreement,
he
shall
be
presumed
to
have
embezzled
it,
embezzlement,
again,
being
a
species
of
grand
theft
in
california.
in
addition,
the
jury
was
told
that
intent
to
commit
theft
by
fraud
is
presumed
from
failure
to
return
rental
property
within
20
days
of
the
mailing
of
a
demand
letter.
after
seeking
further
clarification
on
the
meaning
of
these
presumptions,
the
jury
deliberated
for
an
additional
nine
minutes
and
then
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
the
grand
theft
charge
and
acquitted
him
of
the
lesser
offense
under
the
vehicle
code.
one
of
the
most
basic
safeguards
against
the
wrongful
deprivation
of
liberty
is
the
requirement
that
the
prosecution
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
is
our
submission
today
that
the
instructions
to
appellant's
jury
violated
that
rather
simple
but
fundamental
principle.
in
clear,
unmistakable,
unqualified
language,
the
jury
was
told
that
if
it
concluded
that
appellant
had
wilfully
kept
a
car
more
than
five
extra
days,
it
was
to
find
that
he
was
a
thief.
as
a
consequence
of
that
instruction,
the
jury
was
authorized
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty,
even
though
the
prosecution
had
not
proven
him
guilty.
we
think
that
that
instruction
is
plainly
unconstitutional
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
indeed,
as
the
state
of
california
now
concedes,
in
that
respect,
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
this
court's
decisions
in
francis
v.
franklin
and
sandstrom
v.
montana.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
it
does
suggest
that,
uh,
and
indeed,
i
believe
that
is
the
only
remaining
issue
in
the
case,
unless,
and
let
me
turn
my
attention
to
that,
if
i
may.
i,
we,
seriously
question
whether
a
violation
of
this
particular
nature
is
even
subject
to
harmless
error
but
i--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--sandstrom,
i
believe,
did
not.
rose
v.
clark--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--it
is
certainly
subject
to
that
construction.
we
believe
that
rose
v.
clark,
uh,
does
not
control
this
case.
but
let
me
stress
at
the
outside,
before
explaining
that
position,
that
ultimately
the
error
here,
in
our
judgment,
so
clearly
was
harmful
that
there
really
is
no
reason
for
the
court
to
address
that
more
abstract
threshold
issue,
and
we
think
the
error
was
harmful
for
a
number
of
reasons.
assuming
that
the
standard
of
rose
v.
clark
does
apply
in
this
case,
the
issue
would
be
whether
the,
it,
whether
permanent
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
automobile,
which
is
the
central
element
to
this,
uh,
crime,
whether
a
reviewing
court
could
conclude
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
evidence
of
that
intent
was
so
overwhelming
that
it
could
conclude
that
the
jury
must
not
have
even
relied
on
the
presumption,
and
we
don't
think
the
state
has
made
that
argument,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
state
can
make
that
argument.
indeed,
we
think
the
error
here
was
prejudicial
under
that
standard
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
evidence
of,
and
by
the
way,
let
me,
let
me
make
something
clear,
that
this
jury
was
told
on
four
occasions.
it
was
told
four
occasions
that
in
order
to
convict
appellant
of
grand
theft
it
had
to
find
an
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
permanent
possession,
and
that's
the
crucial
element
here.
now
the
evidence--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--it,
it
does
say
that
now.
it
certainly
didn't
say
that
at
trial
when
the
trial
judge
gave
the
standard
pattern
jury
instructions
that
operate
and
are
presumptively
correct,
correct
in
california,
and
those
instructions
on
four
separate
occasions
said
grand
theft
requires
a
specific
intent
to
keep
the
car
permanently,
and
embezzlement
is
a
species
of
grand
theft.
i
think
that
at
this
point,
it's
too
late
in
the
day
for
the
state
to
come
forward
and
suggest
that
the
law
of
california
is
different
from
the
law
that
was
applied
by
a
california
court.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
they,
they
certainly
can
speak
with
final
authority
on
that.
i
don't
think
as
a
matter
of
harmless
error
jurisprudence
that
makes
any
difference
at
all.
i
think
the
central
issue
here
is
the
crime
with
which
this
individual
was
charged,
and
here
the
jury
was
told
four
times,
grand
theft,
of
which
embezzlement
is
a,
is
a
variety,
requires
an
intent
to
keep
the
car
permanently.
i
don't
think
harmless
error
analysis
entitles
a
review
in
court
to
return
to
the
scene
and
find,
well,
in
any
event,
he
is
guilty
of
a
lesser
crime
than
that,
which
the
jury
was
told
to
find
the
crime.
for
that
reason,
it
would
be
our
suggestion
that
regardless
of
what
the
crime
of
embezzlement
may
or
may
not
be
in
california,
nothing
turns
on
that
as
a
matter
of
harmless
error
analysis.
on
this
issue
of
intent,
uh,
the
evidence,
uh,
we
would
suggest,
was
really
quite
equivocal.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which,
uh,
the
evidence
suggested
that
the
car
had
been
abandoned,
that
the
person
who
had
leased
the
car
had
been
caught
trying
to
sell
it,
that
he'd
been
trying
to
cross
a
border
or
anything
of
that
nature.
this
automobile
was
found
down
wilshire
boulevard
from
the
place
where
it
was
rented,
and
it
was
found
at
an
address
that
had
been
provided
at
the,
by
appellant
at
the
time
he
had
leased
the
car.
now,
we
would
suggest
that
the
jury
could
very
reasonably
conclude
that
whatever
else
was
going
on
in
this
case,
that
did
not
suggest
an
intent
to
keep
the
car
permanently.
moreover,
this
is
a
somewhat
unusual
case,
as
harmless
error
cases
go,
even
assuming
that
rose
applies,
in
that
the
jury
need
not,
rather,
in
that
the
court
need
not
really
speculate
as
to
what
the
jury
would
have
done,
whether
in
fact
it
found
a
need
to
rely
on
the
presumptions.
indeed,
uh,
we
have
included
in
the
joint
appendix
a
question,
and
i
think
it's
found
on
page
23,
but
it's
a
question
that
was
submitted
to,
uh,
the
court
after
the
period
had
been
deliberating
for
a
while.
and
that
question
asks
the
court
in
no
uncertain
terms,
what
about
this
requirement
of
intent
to
keep
the
car
permanently,
and
just
how
do
these
presumptions
work
with
respect
to
that
element.
the
jury,
so
far
as
the
record
reveals,
was
reinstructed
pursuant
to
the
offending
instructions,
and
nine
minutes
later
came
back
with
a
verdict
of
not,
of,
of
guilty.
and
we
think
that
that
chain
of
events
is,
simply
as
a
matter
of
logic
and
reason,
inconsistent
with
the
suggestion
that
the
jury
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
rely
on
the
presumptions.
let
me
suggest,
uh,
uh,
on
this
issue
of
remand,
i
recognize
that
the
issues,
and
i
think
we're
as
guilty
as
the
state,
provide
something
of
a
mixed
message
on
this
as
to
whether
we
would
like
the
matter
resolved
here
in
this
court
or
resolved,
uh,
or
handed
back.
and
let
me
further
suggest
that
we
realize
that
as
a
matter
of
precedent,
we're
sailing
into
something
of
a
stiff
wind
here.
it
certainly
is
the
general
practice
of
this
court
to
remand
on
harmless
error
issues,
uh,
when
the
court
below
has
not
taken
a
first
cut
at
it.
we
would
suggest,
however,
that
the
considerations
that,
uh,
underlie
that
practice,
are
absent
in
this
case.
we
would
rely
in
particular
on
the
apparent
absence
of
the
trial
transcript.
the
record
in
this
case
is
extremely
spare,
so
far
as
we
have
been
told
by
the
clerk's
office
of
this
court
and
by
the
state
of
california,
the
trial
transcript
has,
there
was
never
transcribed
from
the
recording,
and
is
simply
not
to
be
had.
in
light
of
the,
the
rather
spare
nature
of
the
record,
we
don't
think
that
it
would
be
any,
uh,
more
or
less
efficient
for
this
court
to
make
that
determination
than
to
hand
it
back,
and
i
would
also
suggest,
if
i
might,
that
this
case
has
been
kicking
around
now
for
over
four
years
in
the
california
system.
it
is
our
submission
that
the
error
here,
particularly
in
light
of
the
jury
question,
was
so
obviously
prejudicial,
that
there
really
is
no
reason
to
keep
this
case
lingering
on
any
longer.
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
below
in
its
entirety.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
he
did
not,
justice
kennedy.
he
represented
himself,
but
he
did
not
take
the
stand,
and
therefore,
anything
he
said
would
not
have
been
under
oath.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
the
appeal
was
conducted
pursuant
to
one
of
california's
what
is
known
as
the
settled
statement
of
fact
on
appeal,
in
lieu
of
a
transcript.
and
the
settled
statement
of
fact
on
appeal
says
that
she,
uh,
took
the
stand,
his
girlfriend
took
the
stand,
testified
that,
uh,
appellant
had
a
substantial
amount
of
money
with
him,
uh,
when
he
was
in
the
vicinity
of
the
rental
car
agency,
but
she
had
absolutely
no
idea
what
that
money
was
for.
there
was
a
subsequently
filed
affidavit
which,
i
must
concede,
i
don't
think
is
part,
was
part
of
the
record
below
in
any
kind
of
formal
sense.
i
think
it
was
before
the
court,
but
i
don't
think
it
was
the
basis
for
the
court
below,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
can
fully
take
that
into
account
in,
in,
in
its
estimation
of
the
case.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve,
if
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i
too
have
a
hard
act
to
follow,
being
limited
to
the
english
language,
but
i
only
have
one
or
two
very,
very
brief
points.
i,
i,
i
just
want
the
record
to
be
clear
here
that
the
state
of
california,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
uh,
conceding
that
if
the
trial
transcript
is
found,
it
will
be
germane
to
harmless
error
review,
and
i
would
just
point
out
that
throughout
mr.
carella's
travels
in
this
case,
he
has
tried
very,
very
hard
to
get
this
transcript
for
many
years.
and
i
now
understand
the
state
of
california
to
be
telling
him
for
the
first
time,
that
the
transcript
is
available
and
that
it
indeed
is
germane.
but
i
would
also
suggest
that
an
error
so
clearly
harmful
as
this
one
isn't
going
to
get
any
more
harmful
by
reviewing
the
transcript,
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
again
ask
the
court
to
make
what
i
would
hope
would
be
a
very
brief
evaluation
harmless
error
issue
and
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
because
this
jury
was
charged
on
four
different
occasions
that
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
permanent
possession
was
an
element
of
the
law
of
theft
in
california.
i
don't
think
in
undertaking
a
harmless
error
review
the
court
does
anything
other
than
look
at
the
crime
as
charged
and
measure
it
against
the
record
evidence
to
determine
whether
that
record
evidence
overwhelmingly
demonstrates
proof
of
the
crime
as
charged.
i
don't
think--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--i
believe
that's
right.
i
believe
that,
uh,--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--with
respect,
i
would,
i
would
disagree,
and
i
would
disagree
on
two
grounds.
first
of
all,
obviously,
that
is
not
the
law
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
as,
as
it
arrives
today.
there
is
a
theoretical
possibility
that
the
court
below
would
reach
a
different
determination.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i
have
no
cases
precisely
for
that.
however,
i
can
suggest
that
if
an
individual
is
found
guilty
of
murder,
for
example,
i
think
the
case
is
presnell,
it's
not
incumbent
on
the
court
to
come
back
and
say
that,
well,
in
any
event
he's
guilty
of
assault.
and
for
that
reason,
we're
going
to
hold
him
guilty
of
that,
anyway.
that
certainly
would
be
improper.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
it
did.
it
upheld
it
against--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--the
instruction
was
approved.
that
is
correct.
i,
i
would
agree
with
the
state
of
california
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
beyond
the
instruction.
we
think
the
statutes
are
unconstitutional
in
all
their
applications,
but
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
to
go
beyond--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
well,
there
has
been
some
back
and
forth
on
that
over
the
last,
uh,
several
months.
the
case,
there
is
no
transcript.
there
is
a
tape
recording--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--i
think,
i
think
you
can,
justice
marshall,
because
the
case
was
decided
by
the
court
below
on
something
called
a
settled
statement
of
fact
on
appeal,
which
under
the
law
of
california
stands
in
the
place
of
a
transcript,
and
that
is
before
this
court,
and
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
today.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i
believe
it
is.
thank
you
very
much.
