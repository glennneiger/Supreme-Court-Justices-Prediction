don't
you
agree
that
an
evaluation
of
the
harmless
error
issue
does
require
us
to
decide
what
california
is,
uh,
law
is
on,
on
the
permanent
versus
temporary,
uh,
deprivation
of
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
agree
with
that,
why
don't
you
agree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
charge
to
the
jury
goes
beyond,
uh,
what
is
necessary
to
establish
the,
the
crime,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
have
any
many
cases
for
that?
i,
i,
see,
i
wouldn't
think,
i
would
think
that
if
the
judge
mistakenly
tells
the
jury
to
find
something
that
they
don't
have
to
find,
and
that
it's
very
clear
that
that
isn't
necessary
under
the
state's
law,
that
we
could
find...
and
the
only
issue
in
the
case
becomes
whether,
whether
a
jury
could
possibly
have
found
that,
i
would
think
we
could
say
harmless
error,
even
if
a
jury
couldn't
have
found
it
since
it
wasn't
necessary
to
the
conviction,
uh,
no
harm
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
sure.
i
understand
that.
but
do
you
have
any
cases
that
say
that
everything
you
charge
the
jury
with
you
have
to
prove?
