mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
below,
little
did
we
anticipate
that
this
case,
which
resulted
in
an
unpublished
opinion
without
precedential
value,
would've
come
before
this,
uh,
court,
uh,
as
perhaps
one
of
the
last
mandatory
appeals
from
state
court
judgments,
but,
uh,
here
we
are.
and
being
here,
what
should
be
done?
of
course,
via
justicia,
let
justice
be
done,
though
the
heavens
fall,
but
coming
down
to
specifics,
we
agree
that
the
judgment
should
be
vacated
and
suggest
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
court
below
for
a
consideration
of
the
chapman
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
the
position
taken
by
the
state
in
the
lower
court
was
precisely
the
same,
your
honor.
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
below
that
instructional
error
was
made
in
violation
of
due
process
of
law,
but
we
took
the
position
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
and
the
court
below
thought
it,
in
their
wisdom,
not
to
take
our
advice,
and,
and
it
is
in
the
nature
of
meant
to
err,
and
i
suppose
that
is
true,
of
course,
as
well.
and,
therefore,
this
appeal
is
before
this
court,
and,
uh,
it
is
not
completely,
i
hope,
without
interest,
although
we
have
had
a
tough
act
to
follow.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
uh,
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
uh,
well,
because,
we
took
the
position
in
that
that
this
court
could,
in
the
first
instance,
review
the
case
for
harmless
error
review,
uh,
as
to
whether
there
was
harmless
error,
and
i,
we
reconsidered
our
position,
and,
uh,
thought
that
it
would
be
more
appropriate
for
the
court
below
to
undertake
that
inquiry.
uh,
i
might
add,
your
honor,
that,
uh,
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
any
reporter's
transcript
of
the
trial,
it
is
true
that
this
case
was
decided
in
the
court
below
on
a
subtle
statement.
uh,
mr.
carella
failing
three
times
to
appear
for
the
conference
on
the
settle
statement,
and
uh,
the
issue,
in
any
event,
not
being
before
this
court
as
to
whether
this
was
properly
done
or
not
done.
uh,
nevertheless,
uh,
we
have
determined
within
the
last
week
that
the
court
reporter,
who
had
submerged
somewhere,
has
surfaced.
i
have,
during
the
last
week,
uh,
been
advised
of
his,
uh,
telephone
number,
his
address
and
that
his
representation
that
he
does
have
the
notes
of
the
transcript.
so,
volla
!
uh,
counsel
chastises
us,
uh,
in
this
case
for
departing
from
the
general
rule
that
the
law
of
the
state
should
be
taken
as
that
of
the
court
below.
and,
of
course,
we
take
the
position
that
the
court
below,
uh,
erred
in
considering
that
the
california
statutes
in
question,
484
subdivision
(b)
of
the
penal
code
and
10855
of
the
vehicle
code,
were
constitutional,
at
least
implicitly
so
ruled.
and
their
construction,
it
seems
to
me,
was
that
yes,
these
were
statutes
establishing
presumption
pertaining
to
burdens
of
producing
evidence,
but
that
the
jury
was
not
required
to
be
instructed
as
to
the
effect
of
the
presumption.
and
reading
sandstrom
as
we
did,
we
had
to
concede
that
that
would
be
an
improper
construction
of
the
statute.
now,
under,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
hicks
v.
felock,
the
general
rule
that
this
court
will
follow
the
construction
of
the,
uh,
the,
uh,
court,
state
court
of
last
resort,
is
open
to
the
exception
when
there
is
otherwise
persuasive
data
that
would
convince
this
court
that
the
highest
court
of
the
state
would
decide
otherwise.
and
this
is
precisely
the
case
in
this,
uh,
in
this
case,
because
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
people
versus
jackman,
jackson,
a
1903
case,
ruled
and
recognized
the
effect
of
penal
code
section
512
that
the
intent
to
restore
property
is
not
a
defense
to
an
embezzlement
case.
it
recognized
that
the
intent
to
steal
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime
of
embezzlement
under
the
law
of
california.
the
fraudulent
intent
is
the
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
permanently
or
temporarily
of
his
property.
now,
had
this
problem
been
presented
to
the
court
below,
and
it
was
not,
everybody
like
emmanuel
kant
before
reading
david
hume's
works
was,
were
asleep
with
their
dogmatic,
dogmatic
slumbers.
uh,
instructions
had
developed.
but
if
the
question
had
been
squarely
presented
to
the
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court,
they
would,
under
the
doctrine
of
auto
equity
sales,
uh,
be
compelled
to
rule
that
the
crime
of
embezzlement,
yea,
even
of
a
automobile,
uh,
does
not
include
the
intent
to
steal
as
an
element
of
the
offense.
so,
therefore,
our
position
modestly
is
that
since
the
intent
to
steal
entails
as
a
lesser
intent,
as
it
were,
the
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
permanently
or
temporarily,
uh,
no
harm,
no
foul
as
far
as
the
conviction
in
this
case.
similarly,
the
court
below,
uh,
in
interpreting
the
statutes
in
question
as
they
did,
failed
to
follow
the
mandate
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
roder
that
all
state
statutes
creating
presumptions,
creating
or
confirming
presumptions,
are
to
be
interpreted
so
as
to
save
their
constitutionality.
and
so,
therefore,
in
that
ca...
particular
case,
a
presumption,
uh,
pertaining
to
the
guilty
knowledge
in
a,
uh,
receiving
stolen
property
prosecution
was,
was
reinterpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court
to
create
a
permissive
inference.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
but
we
would
like
to
point
out,
your
honor,
that
in
terms
of
re...
a
remand
for
determination
of
the
harmless
error
doctrine,
it
would
be
appropriate
and
would
give
the
court
below
a
reopportunity
to
rethink
what
is
the
applicable
california
law.
i
should
point
out,
of
course,
that
of
course
we
are
interested
in
preserving
the
viability
of
our
statutes,
and
from
the
comments
of
the
court,
the
constitutional...
constitutional
viability
of
our
statutes
and
from
the
comments
of
the
court,
i,
i
have
no
such
apprehension.
i
should
like
to
certainly
agree--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--uh,
no.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
[laughter]
uh,
but,
uh,
certainly
as
people
v.
roder,
uh,
has
established
the
judicial
policy
of
the
state
of
california
that
california
presumption
statutes
aren't
to
be
so
construed
as
to
preserve
their
viability
under
the
doctrines
of
this
court
from
sandstrom
and--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--well,
is--
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
--the,
the
instructions
were
clearly
erroneous.
but,
however,
in
terms
of
a
remand,
it
would,
uh,
appear
necessary
for
the
court
below
to
make
an
appropriate
determination
of
what
is
proper
california
law.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
uh,
we
would
submit
the
case.
mr.
arnold
t.
guminski
thank
you,
your
honor.
