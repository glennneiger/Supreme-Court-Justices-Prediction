justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cerf,
i
take
it
the
state
now
says,
though,
that
the
error
in
the
case
might
be
harmless.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
i
thought
sandstrom
applied
a
harmless
error
analysis,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
rose
v.
clark
did.
in
any
event,
i,
i
think,
uh,
it
was
certainly
open
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
the
state
now
says,
well,
embezzlement
in
california
requires
less.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
cerf,
i
gather
that
on
the
appellate
review,
which
was
granted
without
opinion,
that
it
upheld
the
conviction
below
in,
in
california.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
more
than
just
a
trial
court
instruction.
we
have,
we
have
it
approved
on,
on
the
one
appellate
review
it
had.
