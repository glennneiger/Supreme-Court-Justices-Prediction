we'll
hear
argument
next
on
in
87-6997,
eugene
john
carella
v.
california.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
this
suggest
the
desirability
of
letting
the
california
court
of
appeal
make
this
determination?
they
can
speak
with
final
authority,
uh,
make
the
determination
on
harmless
error.
they
can
speak
with
final
authority
on
what
embezzlement
requires
under
california
law.
we
can't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cerf.
uh,
mr.
guminski?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's...
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
that,
mr.
guminski.
i
mean,
if
the
court
of
appeal
has
incorrectly
followed
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
that's
between
them,
not
our
problem.

justice

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cerf.
the
case
is
submitted.
