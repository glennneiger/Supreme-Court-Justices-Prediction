mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
does
the
city
infringe
a
minor's
right
of
association
by
allowing
dance
halls
to
operate
in
the
city
of
dallas
and
admit
those
ages
14
to
18
only?
i
will
address
that
there
is
no
constitutionally
protected
right
of
association
in
a
dance
hall;
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
expand
constitutional
protection
to
include
such
a
right;
and
that
even
assuming
there
is
some
right
implicated
by
the
ordinance
that
is
challenged,
the
city
does
not
infringe
that
right
by
the
ordinance
challenged.
and
in
any
case,
the
city
has
a
rational
and
even
compelling
interest
in
regulating
dance
halls
for
the
protection
of
minors.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
yes.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
we
place
reliance
on
the
roberts
precedent
not
only
because
it
is
the
most
recent
analysis
of
associational
freedoms,
but
also
because
it
is
reasonable.
this
court
in
that
precedent
without
dissent
tied
associational
freedom
to
the
bill
of
rights
and
found
protection
first
for
intimate
relations
central
to
the
concept
of
personal
liberty.
the...
all
of
us
as
american
citizens
enjoy
a
high
degree
of
personal
liberty,
but
we
do
not
enjoy
the
personal
autonomy
alleged
by
respondents
in
this
case.
we
do
not
enjoy
the
autonomy
in
all
things
that
may
serve
us
as
recreation.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
no,
i
think
that
would
be
going
much
too
far.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
no,
there's
not
a
constitutionally
protected
right
of
association.
of
course,
minors
as...
as
all
of
us,
have
personal
liberty,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
would
guarantee
purely
recreational
association.
i
think
for
a
city
to
make
such
a
blanket
prohibition
would
be
similar
perhaps
to
the
d.c.
city...
city
council
submitting
to
the
mayor
the
curfew
ordinance.
i
think
that
may
not
be
a
constitutional
infringement,
but
i
think...
as
far
as
social
association,
but
i
think
it
raises
equal
protection
problems
and...
and
other
sorts
of
constitutional--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--it
is
a
constitutional
principle.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
ordinance
would
probably
not
infringe
the
alleged
constitutional
protection
of
social
association.
but
it
would
implicate
other
constitutional
protections.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
your
hypothetical
and
perhaps
others
would
be
going
too
far.
dance
halls
do
not
exhibit
the
characteristics
of
intimate
associations
that
this
court
has
protected
in
the
past.
they
are
primarily
large
gatherings.
mr.
stanglin's
testimony
in
the
district
court
was
that
it
was
not
unusual
for
there
to
be
800
to
1,000
persons
in
his
establishment.
they
are
not
selective
in
who
they
admit
to
the
dance
hall,
and
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
think
that
of
800
or
1,000
teenagers,
a
large
percentage
are
going
to
be
strangers
to
each
other.
and
i
think
it
is
not
reasonable
to
compare
such
a
setting
or
such
an
atmosphere
with,
for
example,
the
marital
bedroom.
this
court
has
also
recognized
constitutional
protection
in
the
area
of
expressive
association,
in
other
words,
gathering
to
exercise
rights
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment,
such
things
as
freedom
of
speech,
religious
beliefs
and
to
petition
the
government.
however,
the
dance
hall
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
not
an
association
at
all
in
the
sense
of
being
an
organization
with
a
collective
identity.
patrons
do
not
gather
at
a
dance
hall
primarily
to
exercise
their
right
of
free
speech
or
to
petition
the
government,
nor
do
they
primarily
go
there
to
exercise
religious
beliefs.
so,
although
minors
do
enjoy
personal
liberty
to
some
extent,
they
do
not
have
this
autonomy
that
respondents
allege
in
whatever
serves
them
as
recreat
on.
i
think
it
would
be
unwise
to
give
credence
to
respondent's
suggestion
of
social
associational
rights
because
it
would
chill
the
efforts
of
state
and
local
governments
to
create
age-appropriate
categories
for
the
use
of
municipal
facilities
or
what
have
you.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
yes,
your
honor.
a
primary
tenet
of
my
argument
is
the
fact
of
their
minority
because
i
believe
that
the
first
amendment
assumes
the
capacity
to
exercise
independent
judgment,
and
minors
cannot
be
assumed
to
have
met
that
prerequisite
to
exercise
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
i
think
it's--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--correct.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
my
position
is
there
is
no
right
for
them
either.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
correct.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
well,
assuming
that
you
might
find
some
associational
right--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--their
minority
is
just
an
added...
the
fact
of
minority
is
the
compelling
interest
should
you
decide
to
apply
that
strict
a
scrutiny
to
the
city's
ordinance.
as
i
was
saying,
if
the
city
of
dallas'
ordinance
is
invalid
based
on
its
regulation
of
minors,
what
then
of
the
city's
ability
to
regulate,
for
example,
campgrounds
or
swimming
pools,
as
amicus
have
suggested,
purely
on
the
basis
of
age?
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
in
a
very
broad
sense,
everything
we
do
is...
is
a
form
of
expression.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
i
don't
think
that
it
would
infringe
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
there
again
unless
it
is...
i
don't
think
the
constitution
would
be
implicated
in
that
case.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
same
thing.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
speaking.
i
think
you
are
getting
closer
toward
what
might
be
wrapped
up
in
the
exercise
of
freedom
of
speech.
perhaps
they're
taking
a
speech
class
that
centers
on
a
particular
issue.
i
don't
know.
but
i
think
you're
getting
closer
to
it.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
no,
i
don't
believe
our
ordinance
would
infringe
any
assumed
right
because
it
doesn't
ban
the
dancing.
it
doesn't
ban
the
demonstrations.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
it
doesn't
even
ban
dancing
with
an
older
person
because
there
are
exceptions
to
the
ordinance.
for
example,
dances
at
schools
are
completely
exempt
from
the
ordinance.
a
school
does
not
have
to
obtain
a
dance
hall
license.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
correct.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
correct.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
no,
i
don't.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
correct.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
well,
i
assume
he
means--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--correct,
correct.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
correct.
to
take
that
and...
and
expand
on
it,
the
city
in
this
case
has
found
such
a
basis
for...
for
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ordinance
is
needed.
we
don't
feel
that
it
is...
that
it
has
implicated
any
constitutional
right,
but
we
do
feel
we're
justified
in
doing
it
nonetheless,
even
if
you
assumed
some
right.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
i'm
saying
that
in
this
particular
case,
the...
the
part
of
the
ordinance
that
is
challenged
does
not
bring
into
question
any
constitutional
provision.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
correct.
and
on
the...
as
far
as
the
ordinance
being
challenged.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
no,
that's
not
my
position.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
well,
they
have
constitutional
rights.
and
in
the
associational
context,
they
have
associational
rights
for
intimate
relations,
which
are
not
implicated
here,
and
they
have
constitutional
rights
to
associate
for
expressive
purposes
in
engaging
in
their
first
amendment
rights
of
free
speech,
et
cetera,
which
is
not
implicated
here.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
it
could
be
raised.
it
has
not
been
asserted
at
this
level.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
no.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
correct.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
we
have
not
challenged
their
standing
in
this
court.
i
think
it's
at
least
arguable
under
some
of
this
court's
decisions
that
they
do
have
standing
because
of
his
economic
injury
that
he
alleged
in
the
district
court.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
i
don't
believe
we've
ever
challenged
his
standing.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
yes,
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
addressed--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--yes,
i'm
sure
they
have
a
standing
requirement.
and
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
because
of
his
economic
injury,
he
does
have
an
injury
caused
by
this
particular
ordinance
and
thus
is...
was
appropriate
in
challenging
it
himself.
the
court--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--he
testified
in
the
district
court.
the
record
reveals
that
he
felt
like
the
ordinance
would
restrict
who
he
could
admit
and
that
it
would
cut
his
business
and...
and
the...
and
the
uncertainty
of
that
type
of
business
was
such
that
it
is
very
easy
to
go
out
of
business
with
just
a
swing
of
the
mood
of
the
patrons
to
go
patronize
another
establishment.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
correct.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
yes.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
i
don't
think
it
would
hold
that
many.
i
think
the
testimony
in
the
district
court
was
that
he
would
have
anywhere
from
three
to
1,000,
but
that
it
was
not
unusual
for
there
to
be
two...
200
to
800
to
1,000
on
big
nights.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
no.
it
is
an
expansion
of
an
existing
ordinance.
before
the
challenged
ordinance
went
into
effect,
minors
could
not
go
to
an
adult
dance
hall
without
their
parent
or
guardian.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
that's
our
position,
yes.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
because
after
it
goes
into
effect,
minors
still
cannot
go
to
the
adult
dance
halls
without
their
parent
or
guardian,
but
they
now
also
have
what
we
call
the
class
e
dance
hall
which
is
just
for
the
14
to
18-year
olds.
so,
the
practical
effect
of
the
ordinance
challenged
is
that
it's
an
expansion
of
their
associational
abilities.
they
have
more
places
they
can
go.
as
amicus
characterized
it,
it's...
it's
more
or
less
a
safe
harbor
for
them
in
the
dancing
context.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
basically...
or
very
generally
speaking,
classes
a,
b
and
c
differ...
are
all
adult
dance
halls
and
differ
as
to
the
number
of
days
per
week
that
dancing
is
allowed.
class
d
dance
halls
or
dance...
are
dance
instruction
halls.
and
then
the
class
e
is
the
teen
dance
halls.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
no,
he
can
go
to...
he
can
go
to
a
dance
instruction
hall
without
restriction.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
he
can
go
to
adult
dance
halls
a,
b
or
c
with
their
parent
or
guardian.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
he
also
held
a
class
b
license
at
the
same
time
he
held
a
class
e
license.
the
problem
with
having
both
of
them,
obviously,
resulted
in
the
fact
that
he
couldn't
allow
in
people
over
18
if
he
was
going
to
allow
in
the
younger
people
without
their
parents.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
so,
yes,
in...
in
some
degree
it
was
of
his
own
volition.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
pardon?
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
i
believe
they
are.
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
the
city's
ordinance
was
overbroad,
but
i
believe
that
analysis
is
flawed
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
substantial
interference
with
a
protected
right.
as
i
began,
i
mentioned
that
our
position
is
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
associate
in
a
dance
hall.
but
even
if
you
were
to
assume
such
a
right,
the
ordinance
challenged
expands
that
right
and
not...
it
does
not
constrict
it.
even
if
you
assumed
that
facts
were
appropriate
to
consider
an
overbreadth
argument,
i
think
the
ordinance
clearly
withstands
that
scrutiny
because
it
is
a
very
narrow
response
to
a
specific
request
of
the
community
to
create
a
dance
hall
opportunity
for
the
kids
without
the
requirement
that
the
parents
go
along
with
them.
it
regulates
only
that
one
type
of
business.
and
the
exceptions
keep
the
city
out
of
the
constitutional
issues
because
we
have
exempted
schools
and
churches,
government
facilities
and
the
like
from
having
to
obtain
a
dance
hall
license.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
is.
it
can
be
characterized
as
such
because
all
we
do--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--no.
we
would
rely
primarily
on
the
roberts
and
rotary
club
decisions
most
recently.
the
other...
another
reason
why
an
overbreadth
argument
would
be
inappropriate
here,
as
i
mentioned,
was
because
the
citizens
specifically
petitioned
the
government
for
this
response.
in
fact,
mr.
stanglin
himself
approached
city
council
members
and
asked
that
there
be
a
place
such
as
a
class
e
dance
hall.
and--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--correct.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
correct.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
we
rely
on
those
cases
because
they
recognized--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--we
rely
on
them
because
they
outline
which
types
of
association
that
receive
constitutional
protection.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
okay.
the...
the
court
of
appeals
also
suggested
and
respondents
suggest
that
there
are
other
ways
to
accomplish
the
city's
objectives,
police
enforcement
of
other
statutes,
for
example.
i
would
concede
that
there
are
additional
ways
of
combatting
the
problem
of
juvenile
crime
and
the
influence
that
older
people
can
have
on
them
to
turn
to
drug
abuse
and
alcohol
abuse
and
the
like,
but
i
will
not
concede
that
there's
a
less
intrusive
way
of
achieving
this
result
in
the
dance
hall
context
because
the
police
department
have...
are
working
on
the
problem
outside
the
dance
hall,
but
not
inside.
the
punishment
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggests
does
not
work
until
there's
a
victim.
and
it
assumes
that
a
perpetrator
is
caught
and
that
there
is
some
deterrent
effect.
and
supervision
is
not
appropriate
in
this
case
because
the
parents
have
said
they
don't
want
to
have
to
go.
that's
the
first
problem.
the
second
problem
is
if
there's
1,000
teenagers
in
this
establishment,
how
are
you
going
to
effectively
prohibit
or
prevent
the
undue
influence
from
reaching
them
before
it's
too
late.
thus,
consistent
with
this
court's
analysis
in
the
city
of
renton
case,
the
city
of
dallas
is
attacking
the
juvenile
crime
problem
this
one
step
at
a
time,
and
they're
doing
it
in
the
least
intrusive
way
that
they
can
in
this
dance
hall
context.
i
think
to
expand
constitutional
protection
beyond
its
already
defined
limits
in
this
area
would
be
unwise
because
it
would
chill
the
efforts
of
the
governments
across
the
entire
spectrum
of
age-appropriate
categories
to
effectively
protect
people
on
account
of
their
minority.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
pick
up
on...
on
his
quote
about
being
as
against
the
federal
government
i
think
is
appropriate
in
this
case
because
if
this
is
expressive
association,
as
he
claims,
clearly
as
he
has
just
stated,
the
intent
of
the
constitutional
framers
was
to
protect
their
expression
as
against
the
federal
government.
and
clearly
they
are
not
gathering
at
this
dance
hall
to
express
the
way
they
dance
as
opposed
to
the
way
the
federal
government
might
like
to
have
them
do
it.
i
think
that's
the
difference.
he
also
attacks
what
he
claims
is
a
lack
of
a
good
record
to
support
the
rational
basis,
even
assuming
you
get
to
that
determination.
however,
the
testimony
in
the
district
court
of
his
client
indicates
that
it
is
not
unusual
or
there
to
be
unwanted
sexual
overtures
at
his
establishment,
this
being
just
for
your
reference
at
pages
22
and
46
in...
in
the
statement
of
facts.
there's
also
testimony
from
his
client
that
alcohol
does
slip
into
his
establishment
despite
his
rules
against
it,
that
there's
rowdiness
in
his
establishment
despite
his
rules
against
it,
and
that
there
are
drugs
in
his
establishment
despite
his
attempts
to
keep
them
out.
i
don't
think
there
is
this
void
in
the
record
that
he
claims.
the
police
department...
several
police
officers
who
are
charged
with
enforcing
these
types
of
regulations
testified
in
the
district
court
that
on
the
one
hand,
all
other
things
being
equal,
if
they
were
called
to
a
dance
hall
on
a
disturbance,
they
would
expect
the
mood
of
the
patrons
to
be
much
more
aggressive
than
if
they
were
approaching,
for
example,
a
movie
theater.
and
the
police
testified
that
they've
attributed
an
increase
in
the
crime
rate
in
certain
neighborhoods
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
dance
hall
in
the
neighborhood.
so,
the
record--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--the
record
is...
admittedly
the
record
is
silent
as
to
ages.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
well,
the
problem
in
this--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--well,
no,
because
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
his
client
had
both
a
class
b
and
a
class
e
license,
and
apparently
was
in
the
practice
of
letting
in
people
of
all
ages.
whether
or
not
that
was
legal
at
a
particular
time,
i
don't
know.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
that's
correct.
the
record
does
not
show
that,
but
the
record
does
show
that
the
people
who
consulted
on
this
issue
recognized
the
fact
that
older
people
do
have
greater
access
to
illicit
drugs
and
alcohol.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
xxx.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
i
would
admit
that...
that
people
of
tender
years
do
have
access,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
make
the
statement
that
older
people
have
greater
access,
however.
although
the
record
is
silent
on
the
particular
age
of
the
perpetrators,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
make
that
connection.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
well--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--correct.
i...
i
think
to
some
degree
the...
the
issues
of
facts
involved
in
the
district
court
were
judicially
recognized.
but
the
record
was
not
void
of
a
discussion
of
those
facts
and
a
presentation
of
those
facts
to
the
district
court.
respondent
also
makes
the
statement
that
we've
singled
out
the
dance
hall
as
opposed
to
the
skating
that
goes
on
in
the
same
building.
the
city
did
not
create
a
city
v.
mr.
stanglin
ordinance.
we
responded
directly
to
the...
the
request
of
the
citizens
solely
on
the
issue
of
dance
halls.
the
fact
that
he
has
an
unusual
establishment
was...
was
not
a
factor
in
arriving
at
the
ordinance.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
no,
the
record
does
not
tell
us.
a
recent
inquiry
revealed
that
of
the
500
dance
halls
in
the
city
at
this
point,
there's
only
one
or
two
licenses
in
effect,
but
no
one
is
actually
doing
it
because,
like
i
say,
at
this
point
we
are
enjoined
from
enforcing
that
part
of
the
ordinance.
i
believe
at
the
time
the
suit
arose,
there
were
only
one
or
two
such
dance
halls
in
existence.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
on
sheer
numbers,
yes.
i
think
in
general
the--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--on
a
recent
inquiry
to
the
police
department
in
charge
of
the
licensing,
he
said
that
of
all
the
categories,
there
were
approximately
500
now
in...
licenses
in
effect.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
we
allow
dancing.
we
allow
dancing
of
all
ages
and...
and
we
allow
dancing
under
certain
circumstances
with
any
age
person.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
well,
we're
certainly--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--we're
certainly
not--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--we're
certainly
not
conceding
that
we
have
no
right
to
move
in
on
the
skating
rinks.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
the...
the
respondent
also
makes
the
statement
that
we
might
be
infringing
on
a
parental
function.
however,
on
these
facts
it's...
it's
clearly
not
the
fact
because,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
it's
the
parents
that
came
to
us
and
contributed
in
the
community
meetings
and
said
we
don't
want
to
have
to
go
with
them.
we
want
you
to
create
a
place
they
can
go
and
dance
where
we
don't
have
to
be
with
them.
so,
i
think
clearly
the
parents
have
expressed
that
they...
you
know,
they
want
to
be
able
to
tell
their
kids
where
they
ought
to
be
able
to
go,
certainly.
but
i
think
on
these
facts,
we
have
the
opposite.
they
want
a
safe
harbor
for
them
to
go
and
dance.
respondent
also
mentioned
that
we
are
somewhere
or
a
scale
and
that
there
should...
we
should
have
to
prove
some
type
of
rational
basis
because
we...
we
say
be
at
one
end
of
the
scale,
but
we
still
have
to
prove
something.
but
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
although--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--we
agree
that
there
are,
you
know,
probably
several
constitutional
provisions
that
are
applicable
to
government
actions.
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
assuming
that
that's
an
appropriate
analysis.
as
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
i
think
we
meet
that
scrutiny
because
they
have--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--on
an
equal
protection
challenge.
however,
in
this
case
we
don't
have
an
equal
protection
challenge.
and
the
first
amendment
does
not
grant
this
right
that
they
claim.
and
that's
what
they've...
they've
sued
under
is
the
first
amendment.
i
think
the
roberts
analysis
is
very
complete
and
very
reasonable
in
defining
maybe
not
the
very
boundaries,
but
at
least--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--in
their
brief
they
argue--
mr.
craig
lee
hopkins
--that
it
was
intimate.
i
understand
today
that
they
are
not
arguing
that
it's
intimate,
and
that
if
it
is,
it's...
it's
not
comparable
to,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
put
it,
the
statutory
rape
type
intimate
association.
i
think
that
analogy
was
very
appropriate
because
there
is
something
that's
an
activity
that
is
wholly
consensual,
but
it's
illegal
strictly
on
the
basis
of
age
and
in
an
attempt
to
protect
minors.
i
thought...
so,
i
would
agree
with
the
chief
justice's
analogy
there.
thank
you
very
much.
