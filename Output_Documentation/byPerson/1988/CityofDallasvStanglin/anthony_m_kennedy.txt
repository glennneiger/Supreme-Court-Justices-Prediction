yes.
but
you
don't
have
to
give
that
answer
anyway
because
you
don't
think
there's
any
constitutional
right
involved
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
you
don't
have
to
distinguish
these
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
picnics
and
swimming
pools
and
any...
because
there's
no
constitutional
right
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
no
associational
right.
you're
making
your
case
harder
than
it
has
to
be.
