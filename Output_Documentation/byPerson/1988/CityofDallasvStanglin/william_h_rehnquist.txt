we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1848,
the
city
of
dallas
v.
charles
m.
stanglin.
mr.
hopkins?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
some
part
of
your
argument,
mr.
hopkins,
depends
on
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
are
minors.
you
would
find
it
a
more
difficult
ordinance
to
justify
if
it
regulated
adults
under
35.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
any
time
you
classify,
you...
you
may
raise
questions
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
may
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
have
a
standing
requirement
similar
to
those
of
federal
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hopkins.
mr.
sheehan,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought...
i
thought
they
agreed
that
they
were
subject
at
least
to
equal
protection
scrutiny,
that
you
couldn't
single
out
one
class
of
people
arbitrarily
and
say
you
can't
go
to
the
dance
hall,
but
everybody
else
can.
i
thought
their
argument
was
that
there's,
no
first
amendment
protection
for
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
really
a
concession.
everybody
is...
every
governmental
action
is
restrained
by
equal
protection
considerations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we'd
also
like
to
hear
your...
you
know,
i
think
the...
probably
the
petitioners'
position
is...
we
can
assume
is
fairly
clear...
have
from
the
petitioner,
so
to
speak.
i
am
sure
we
would
like
to
hear
your...
your
position
too.
do
you
think
this
is
subject
to
something
more
than
rational
basis
scrutiny,
this
sort
of
an
ordinance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
right
to--
--[inaudible].
excuse
me.
the
right
to
go
to
a
dance
hall?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
law
prohibiting
the
scalping
of
ballet
tickets
by
the
state?
would
that
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
law
in
a
state
which
prohibited
sodomy
prohibiting
men
from
dancing
with
one
another?
would
you
say
that
was
subject
to
strict
scrutiny?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
xxx
i
don't
know
if
that's
crystal
clear.
certainly
dancing
is
thought
of
as
a
more
intimate
thing
than...
than
roller
skating,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
maybe
the
city
says
we
just
don't
want
25-year
olds,
not
older
teenagers,
but
25-year
old
dancing
with
14-year
olds.
i
think
they
could
say
that
and
say
we
don't
have
to
extend
our
concerns
for
what
happens
there
to
roller
skating.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no
one
here
is
prevented
from
dancing
or
from
going
to
the
dance
hall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
prevented
from
dancing
with...
youngsters
are
prevented
from
dancing
with
older
people.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
mr.
sheehan--
--statutory
rape
law
does
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
so
much
clearer
than
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
definition
it
doesn't
occur
against
someone
is
will.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
only
because
the
legislatures
have
said
it's
a
crime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
not
say
this
is
another
one
of
those
restraints?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
jaycees
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
from
you.
the
jaycees
were
arguing
that
the
law...
ordinance
was
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sheehan.
mr.
hopkins,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hopkins.
the
case
is
submitted.
