justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume...
i
assume
that
the
state
would
have
to
have
a
reason
to...
to
prevent
people
over...
over
18
and
under
35
from
going
dance
halls.
they
just
couldn't...
right?
i
mean,
there
are
some
provisions
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
for
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
there
may
be
reasons
why
these
things
are
invalid,
but
they're
not
invalid
because
of
any...
any
infringement
upon
associational
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
walk
down
the
street
too,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
every...
every
state
statute
that
interferes
with
my
walking
down
the
street
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
i
mean,
you
have
some
constitutional
protection;
that
is,
it
can't
be
taken
away
without
reason.
it
has
to
be
taken
away
on
an
equal
basis
with
other
people.
i...
i
don't
understand
the
state
here
to
be
arguing
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right.
they're
just
saying
that
this
is
not...
this
is
not
the
sort
of
association
that
is
governed
by...
by
our
cases
saying
that
the
first
amendment
attaches
to
it.
that's
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
there's
no...
no...
no
constitutional
protection
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
said
that
dancing
is
an
expressive
activity
in...
in...
in
this
context?
i
mean,
you
know,
when
you're
talking
about
a...
a
go-go
dancer
at
a
club
or
a
ballet
dancer
at
a...
at
a...
at
a
theatrical
production,
yes,
i
can
understand
your
saying
that's
expressive.
but
the
foxtrot?
i
never
knew
that...
i
mean,
it...
if
that's
expressive
activity,
walking
down
the
street
is
an
expressive
activity.
doesn't
expression
convey
you're
trying
to
convey
to
somebody
else,
if
not
an
idea,
at
least
a
feeling
or
something
like
that?
you
don't
dance
to
express
something
to
somebody
else.
you
dance
to
have
fun
unless
you're
a
ballet
dancer
or
a
go-go
dancer,
maybe
a
few
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that...
so,
if
i'm
playing
a
cello
in
a...
in
a...
in
a
closed
room,
i
am...
i
am
engaging
in
expressive
activity.
there
is
nobody
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
i
have
expressive
problems
either.
[laughter]
maybe
that's
why
he's
playing
in
a
closed
room.
some
dancing
looks
like
athletic
activities
too.
throw
them
up
and
throw
them
around.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about...
what
about
prohibiting
minors
from
going
into
places
that
serve
alcoholic
liquors,
nightclubs?
what
do
they
have
to
do?
do
they
have
to
allow
it
for
two
years
so
they
can
show
a
track
record
of...
of
harm?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it
can
here
too.
you
need
a
lab
test
for
all
these
things?
i
xx...
the
harm
is
self-evident.
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
to
have
a...
use
white
rats
or
somebody
to
prove
it
scientifically--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
the
logical...
the
logical
consequence
of
your
position
is
is
not
only
that
the
class
e
restriction
here
is
no
good,
but
also
that
the...
the
prior
law
before
they
adopted
this
preventing
minors
from
going
into
the
class
a,
b
or
c
dance
halls
was
also
bad.
you
can't...
you
can't
say
dance
halls,
but
no
minors
admitted.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
must
be
18.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
eight-year
olds?
justice
antonin
scalia
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
six-year
olds?
justice
antonin
scalia
--anyway,
you...
you
may
be
moving
in
on...
on
roller
skating
rinks
next.
you
just
haven't
gotten
around
to
them.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
step
at
a
time.
we
have
cases
that
say
that's
okay.
you
don't
have
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--eliminate
all
the
evils
at
once.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
conceded
much
today.
[laughter]
