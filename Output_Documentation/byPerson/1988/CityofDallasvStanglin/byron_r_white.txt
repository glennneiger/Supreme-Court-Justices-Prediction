white
well,
don't
you...
don't
you
think
that
dancing
is
some
form
of
expression?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
you'd
have
the
same
reaction
if
this
ordinance
prevented
people
between
the
age
of
14
and
18
from
taking
ballet
lessons?
justice
byron

white
and
is
class
e...
is
the
class
e
the
only
kind
of
dance
hall
a
minor
can
go
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
this
operator
is
the
one
who
got
himself
into
the
e
category.
he
could
have
been
an
a,
b
or
c,
couldn't
he?

overbreadth
just
applies
if
there's
a
first
amendment
category
and
if
there
isn't
any
first
amendment
protected
interest--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
the...
the
decision
and
the
opinion
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
strict...
it
was
a
strict
scrutiny
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
sustained
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
on
the
age,
it's
the
least
restrictive
means,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
strict
scrutiny.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
defend
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
across
the
board,
but
how
about
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
there's
some
legislative...
is
there
a
legislative
finding
here
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
ordinance
started
out
and
said
we,
believing
that
so
and
so?
would
you
say
that...
that...
that
a
court
ought
to
sit
around
and
review
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
lot
of
statutes
start,
off
and
they
have
some
findings
in
it
or
state
what
the
purpose
is.
do
you
think
the
court
ought
to...
shouldn't
the
court
at
least
be
careful
to...
about
disagreeing
with
a
legislative
finding
about
the
real
world?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
a
lot...
a
lot
of
places
and
a
lot
of
people
who
don't
believe
in
dancing
at
all,
don't
believe
in
having
their
children
dance
at
all
with
old
people
or
young
people
or
anybody
else.
and
so,
i...
it
isn't
strange
that
people
would
want
to
limit
the
opportunity
for
their
children
to
dance--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
be
very
careful
about
whom
they
dance
with.

byron

xxx
the
equal
protection
clause
would
have
some
play
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
equal
protection.
suppose
this
ordinance
is
challenged
and
your...
you've
classified
an
age
group
and
you
must
at
least
have
a
rational
basis
for
it.
don't
you
have
to
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
have
to
have...
you
would
have
to
have
a
rational
basis
at
least.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
were...
i
thought
they
were
also
relying
on
the
other
branch
of
roberts,
the
social
intimate
relationship.
