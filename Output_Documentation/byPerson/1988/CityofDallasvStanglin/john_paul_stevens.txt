justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
hopkins,
i'm
a
little--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
interrupt?
i'm
just
a
little
puzzled.
i
thought
your
first
point
is
that
there's
just
no
constitutional
right
at
stake
here
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
would...
what
would
the
constitutional
right
be
at
stake
if
it
was
a
30
to
35-year
ordinance
instead
of
a
14
to
18?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
would
be
the
same
case
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then
why
are
you
arguing
about
young
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical.
supposing
a
15
or
16-year
old
person
was
taking
dancing
lessons
from
a
person
over
21
and
became
quite
expert,
and
wanted
to
show
his
or
her
classmates
and
friends
how
expert
he
or
she
was,
and
wanted
to
give
kind
of
a
demonstration
of
it.
and
the
only
place
that
it
could
be
done
is
in
a
dance
hall
like
this,
or
the
only
place
that
would
happen
to
be
available.
you
wouldn't
think
they
would
have...
there
would
be
any
constitutional
interest
whatsoever
respecting
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
bans
dancing
with
that
particular
partner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
right.
but
at
least
it
bans
them
in
this
dance
hall.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sheehan,
could
the...
could
the
city
repeal
the
ordinance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
happens
to
this
constitutional
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
i'm
just
saying
your...
your
client
no
longer...
i
mean,
the
people
would...
if
you
repealed
the
ordinance
entirely,
they
couldn't
go
to
any
other
dance
halls
than
they
go
to
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you're
that
they
they...
they
could
not
constitutionally
repeal
this
ordinance
because
this...
this
provision
that
authorizes
this
kind
of
14
to
18
dance
halls.
if
they
just
took
that
out
of
the
code,
you
would
say
that
would
violate
the
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
another
words,
you
see
a
constitutional
right
to
operate
without
a
license
if
they
don't
authorize
dance
halls
without
a
license.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
rational
basis
is
that
they
think
there
is
some
potential
social
harm
from
allowing
14-year
olds
to
dance
with
25-year
olds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
totally
irrational,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
earlier
said
there
was
no
indication
in
the
record
of
the
reason
for
the
ordinance.
but
as...
it's...
the
lower
court's
opinion
quotes
this
ray
couch,
an
urban
planners
who
explained
his
understanding
of
the
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
court
quotes
him
as
saying
older
kids,
whom
the
ordinance
prohibits
from
entering
these
dance
halls,
can
access
drugs
and
alcohol,
and
they
have
more
mature
sexual
attitudes,
more
liberal
sexual
attitudes
in
general,
and
we're
concerned
about
mixing
up
these
older
individuals
with
youngster's
that
have
not
fully
matured.
now,
maybe
he's
kind
of
extreme.
but
is...
is
that
totally
irrational?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
don't
know
why
one
has
to
be
there
to
have
that
concern.
maybe
the
concern
is
somewhat
extreme,
but...
but
why
do
you
have
to
go
to
a
dance
hall
to
have
concern?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
hopkins,
does
that
testimony
show
that
these
drugs
and
alcohol
and
sexual
overtures
were
all
by
people
over
18?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
assume
they
wouldn't
have
let
them
in
in
the
first
place,
so
they
must
presumably
have
been
by
people
under
that
age.
and
it
seems
to
me
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
tends
to
undercut
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
record
does
not
show,
does
it,
that
this...
these...
these
practices
were
by
older
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
recognized
the
fact
or
they
made
the
assumption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
in
a
lot
of
schools,
as
i
understand
it,
people
who
are
16
or
17
have
access
to
the
same
sort
of
undesirable
materials.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
now
you're
going
back
to
assumptions
where
you
are
just
going
to
start
out
and
explain
that
the
record
answered
these
questions.
i'm
not
sure
the
record
does
answer
them.
that's
all
i'm
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
go
back
to
what
we
all
know,
well,
then
you
don't
need
to
refer
us
to
the
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
of
these...
what
are
they...
class
e
dance
halls
are
licensed
in
dallas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
the
combination
dance
hall
and
skating
rink
is
characteristic
of
these
establishments.
