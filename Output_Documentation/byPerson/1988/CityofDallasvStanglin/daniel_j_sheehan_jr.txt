mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
prepared
remarks
intended
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
the
city
seeks
here
to
say
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
of
association
for
minors.
after
mr.
hopkins'
remarks
that
you
have
just
heard,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
me
to...
to
deliver
that.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
protect
the
right
of
the
people
to
associate
together
even
if
the
purpose
is
entirely
social
and
even
if
the
purpose
may
seem
trivial
to
many.
to
say
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
at
all
to
associate
in
the
type
of
context
presented
in
this
case
is
to
say
that
the
state
is
immune
in
this
area
and
may
do
anything
that
it
chooses
to
do
even
if
that
act
is
arbitrary
and
irrational.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
with
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
believe
they
are
arguing
that
there
is
no
constitutional
protection
and
they're
not
restrained
even
by
a
rational
basis
test.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
heard
that
statement
made
this
afternoon
and
the
concession
that
they
would
be
restrained
by
equal
protection
considerations.
but--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--i
agree,
and
i
also
agree
that
every
governmental
action
is
restrained
by
the
need
to
have
some
rational
basis.
i
think
the
city's
position,
at
least
as
i'm
reading
it
in
the
brief,
is
not
that
there
is
no...
is
not
that
they
need
not
only
demonstrate
no
compelling
interest,
but
that
they
need
not
demonstrate
even
a
rational
basis.
i'll
read
from
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i
think
that
the...
yes,
i
do.
in--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--many
instances,
the
type
of
association
that
i
am
addressing
is
entitled
to
a
compelling
state
interests
standard,
is
required
to
be
more
than
the
rational
basis
standard.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
the
right
to
dance
together
with
persons
of
your
choosing.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
it
is,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
appropriate
analysis.
for
example--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--the
associational
of
everyone,
not
just
minors
because
i
don't
regard
this
as
strictly
a
minor's
associational
rights
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i
can't
go
to
a
class
e
dance
hall.
it
isn't
a
minor's
constitutional
rights
case.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
protect
the
minors.
but
the
prohibition
extends
to
everyone,
and
in
that
sense
it's
different
than
the
cases
that
deal
with
minors
and
minors
alone.
but
to
say
that
they
can
dance
elsewhere
is
simply,
with
due
respect,
i
don't
believe
the
proper
analysis.
in
the
roberts
v.
jaycees
case,
for
example,
the
argument
could
have
been
made
by
the
jaycees
that
the...
that
the
minnesota
anti-discrimination
statute
really
didn't
impose
that
much
restriction
on
their
liberties
because,
first
of
all,
there
were
plenty
of
organizations
that
those
women
could
join
other
than
the
jaycees.
and,
secondly,
how
many
women
are
truly
going
to
be
interested
in
joining
an
organization
whose
avowed
purpose
is
a
promotion
of
young
men's
civic
organization?
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
no,
it's
not.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
justice
brennan,
i'm...
i'm
arguing
for
the
same
type
of
standard
that
i
believe
was
established
in
the
majority
opinion
that
you
authored
in
roberts
and...
for
intimate
associations
where
you
said
there
are
two
poles.
one
is
the
family.
the
other
end
of
the
extreme
may
be
measured
by
large
business
enterprises.
at
the
family
end
it's
entitled
to
probably
the
highest
protection
the
constitution
allows.
whereas
where
the
relationship
is
much
more
attenuated
at
the
large
business
enterprise
end,
it's
not
expressly
stated
what
standard
will
apply,
but
it's
certainly
not
going
to
be
the
compelling
state
interest
one.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
no,
sir,
not
necessarily.
i...
i
classify
social
associations
as
being
subject
to
being
evaluated
or
that
same
type
of
spectrum.
there
may
be
some
social
associations
whose
purpose
is
to
enjoy
together
ballet,
as
justice
white
asked
about.
and
that
is
such
a
clear
cultural
and
expressive
type
of
activity,
that
any
attempt
to
restrict
that
may
well
be
subject
to
the
strict
scrutiny
test,
whereas
the
ability
to
go
into--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be.
i
would
not
subject
that
to
the
strict
scrutiny
test
because
it
doesn't
infringe
on
anyone's
right
to
participate
in
the
association.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
yes--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--it...
it's
not
100
percent
clear
to
me.
but,
yes,
i
think
it
is
although
when
they
get
to
the
age
restriction,
the
court
gets
to...
the
age
restriction
appears
to
be
evaluated
with
that
standard,
whereas
the
standard
dealing
with
the
hours
is...
the...
the
court
makes
a
comment--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--and
on
the
basis
that
it's
a
minimal
intrusion
on
the
associational
rights.
therefore--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i
don't...
i
do
not
defend
that
entirely.
i
do
not
defend
across
the
board.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
all
right.
in
this
case,
i
would
defend
it
on
the
basis
of
dance
being
an
expressive
activity.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
this.
what
has
been
singled
out
here
for
legislation
by
the
city
of
dallas
is
the
ability
of
people
to
dance
together.
they
are
free
to
do
other
things
together.
i
believe
that
that
is
a
legislative
disapproval
of
the
activity
of
dancing
which
has
a
centuries-old
history
of
being
an
expressive
activity.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
yes,
i
would
for
the
reason
that
dancing
is...
is
an
expressive
activity
and,
again,
in
the
context
of
the
ordinance.
all
i
have
before
me
now
is
this
ordinance
and
the
reasons
for
its
enactment.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
well,
to
answer
your
first
question
no,
you
haven't
said
that.
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
your
analysis
of
dancing
itself.
if
i
am
dancing
strictly
for
a
recreational
purpose
and
it
has
its
expressive
elements,
the
fact
that
i
don't
have
any
particular
audience
does
not
impact
the
fact
that
it
is
a
form
of
expression
and
it's
mine.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
yes.
you
don't
have
associational
problems.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
well,
that's
true,
justice
marshall.
in
any
event,
the
significance,
to
get
back
to
the
point...
and...
and
i
do
believe
this
point
has
been
made...
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
even
in
establishing
the
spectrum
that
justice
brennan
mentions,
that
the
far
end
of
that
spectrum...
he
does
say
at
one
end
you
have
the
compelling
state
interest,
strict
scrutiny
highest
standard,
and
at
the
other
end
you
have
no
constitutional
rights.
justice
o'connor
in
the
expressive
association
aspect
in
the
concurring
opinion
establishes
a
similar
type
of
scale
for
expressive
conduct.
one
end
of
the
scale
would
be
the
commercial
enterprise,
and
the
other
being
the
surely
expressive
purpose
of
an
organization.
that
same
type
of
a
scale...
and
if
i'm
understanding
justice
o'connor's
opinion
correctly...
at
the
most
expressive,
pure
expressive,
end
of
that
scale,
the
highest
constitutional
protection
is
accorded.
whereas
at
the
business
enterprise
end
of
it,
the
commercial
enterprise,
if
that's
predominantly
what's
at
stake,
then
only
a
rational
basis
is
necessary
to
further
ordinance
or
legislation
to
pass
muster.
and
i
am
saying
that
i
believe
a
social
association
can
be
analyzed
in
that
same
manner.
and
to
take
the
issue
before
us
now,
dance,
presents
the
opportunity
to
consider
what
has
been
thought
of
as
a
cultural
event
and
presents
then
the
argument
that
a
compelling
state
interest
should
be
applied
because
it
is
an
expressive
activity.
but
many
things
can
be
imagined
that
would
not
fall
into
that
category
that
you
could
not
seriously
argue
are
expressive,
but
you
can't
argue
either
that
unless
the
state
has
some
reason
for
denying
you
the
right
to
do
something,
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
do
so.
the...
one
problem
here
is
that
this
case
presents
something
that's
entirely
different
than
was
presented
in
roberts.
roberts
dealt
with
the
traditional
classical
type
of
organization
with
the
jaycees.
rotary
club
did
the
same
thing.
the
analysis
in
roberts...
justice
brennan
made
the
statement,
our
decisions
have
recognized
two
types
of
association,
and
he
went
on
to
categorize
the
two
types.
that
is
a
completely
accurate
statement.
there
had
been
no
previous
decision
that
really
dealt
in
any
sense
with
a
right
of
social
association.
the
right
that
we
advocate
in
this
case
can
be
dealt
with
within
the
existing
parameters
of
roberts
either
on
the
intimate
or
on
the
expressive
end
by
falling
within
the
scale,
or
the
court
could
choose
to
recognize
a
third
category
that
was
simply
not
presented
in
roberts
and
therefore
isn't
addressed
in
roberts.
and
it--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--did
they
repeal
it?
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i'm
certain
they
could
repeal
it.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
are
you
raising
a
question
of
mootness?
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
well,
see,
justice
stevens,
i
disagree
with
mr.
hopkins'
comments
in
that
respect
for
this
reason.
he
has
made
the
statement
that
actually
the
city's
granting
this
license
and
having
this
ordinance
has
expanded
the
associational
freedom
of
minors.
to
me
that
is
a
very
different
view
of
freedom
than
the
one
that
i
have.
if
the
marketplace
will
sustain
an
organization
that
is
clean
and
well-guarded
and
well-run
and
does
not
serve
alcoholic
beverages
and
plays
music
so
kids
can
come
and
dance,
just
as
they
can
go
to
a
roller
rink
or
to
a
swimming
pool,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
constitutional
for
the
city
to
come
and
shut
them
down
just
because
there's
no
license
or
permit
that
has
been
issued.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i
may
not
be
understanding
your
point,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
if
the
city
did
repeal
it,
i
don't
think
that
they
could
come
in
and
argue
that
because
there's
no
ordinance
permitting
14
to
18-year
olds
to
dance,
therefore,
they
cannot.
if
there
is
no--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--unless
the
city
can...
can
prove
a
rational
basis
for
prohibiting
them
from
operating
that
type
of
establishment,
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
but
i
believe
they
have--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--i
believe
they
have
to
demonstrate
that
that
is
the
case.
there
has
to
be
some
evidence.
they
can't
simply
believe
that
that's
so
and
legislate
in
accordance
with
the
present
city
council
members'
current
beliefs.
if
in
fact
there's
a
rational
basis,
by
definition
it
should
be
subject
to
being
articulated.
and
there
ought
to
be
some
method
that
somebody
can
be
shown
that
here
is
the
problem
and
here
is
the
objective
manifestation
of
the
problem.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i
think
that
the
rational
basis
for
that
type
of
prohibition
can
be
established
ab
initio.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
well--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--i'm
afraid
i
find
myself
disagreeing
with
you
again,
justice
scalla.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
it...
it
is
not
to
me
self-evident.
consider
the
fact
situation.
this
establishment
is
a
roller
rink.
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
age
of
the
people
who
come
into
the
roller
rink.
the
same
music
is
played
for
the
dance
aspect
and
the
roller
skating,
the
same
lighting,
the
same
security
personnel,
the
same
adult
supervision,
the
same
physical
premises.
there
is
a
set
of
pylons
on
the
floor.
on
one
side
of
the
pylons,
they
allow
dancings;
on
the
other
side,
they
allow
skating.
on
the
skating
side,
there
is
no
age
limitation.
now,
if
the
problem
is
that
older
teenagers
corrupt
younger
teenagers,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
show
that
that
occurs
only
in
the
context
of
a
dance
and
doesn't
occur
in
the
context
of
roller
skating.
and
that's
the
record
we
have
here.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i
would
think
of
it
that
way.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
but
they
do
have
to
say
why
they
have
a
concern.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
justice
white,
that
supports
it
at
all.
there's
no--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i
agree
that
the
court
should
be
careful
about
challenging
a
legislative
finding.
but
the
problem
with
this
particular
legislative
finding...
and
it
may
be
because
of
the...
the
roller
skating/dancing
together
in
one
premises
that
makes
that
particularly
hard
to
analyze
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
but
i
wouldn't
give
it...
i
wouldn't
give
it
that
great
of
deference.
this
is
not
what
i
call
a
self-proving
statute.
one
does
not
sit
down
and
read
this
statute
and
say,
on,
yes,
i
see.
i
understand
such
as
the
minnesota
self...
the
statute
against
discrimination.
well,
one
can
read
that
statute
and
understand
immediately.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
it's
not,
but
it's
not
a
legislative
function.
that's
a
parental
function.
and
the
problem
that
you
raise
actually
gets
to
the
problem
of
cities
misusing
their
ability
to
legislate
for
the
good
of
the
people.
there
is,
in
fact,
religious
prejudice
against
dancing,
and
it's
somewhat
prevalent
in
texas.
and
perhaps
that's
the
reason
we
have
this
statute.
and
if
it
is,
then
it's
not
grounded
in
a
concern
for
what's
going
to
happen
to
young
children
dancing
with
older
people.
it
is
grounded
in
a
method
of
advocating
my
religious
position,
that
i
think
all
dance
is
wrong,
so
i'm
going
to
do
what
i
can
to
stop
it.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
but
they're
prevented
from...
they--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--that's...
that's
right.
they're
prevented
from
choosing
their
associations.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
and
there's
a
very
rational
basis
for
it.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
well,
a
statutory
rape,
obviously
involves
something
that...
well,
not
necessarily
occurs
against
someone's
will,
but
you
have
a--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--you
have
a
crime
that
has
been
committed,
and--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--well,
but
the
point
is
is
that
teens
and
older
teens
and
adults
and
younger
teens
are
free
to
associate
with
each
other
within
certain
restraints
and
that's
one
of
them.
they're
not
allowed
to
have
sexual
intercourse
with
someone
that's
not
of
age.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
has
the
same
consequence?
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
ray
couch
is
a...
has
been
with
the
city
of
dallas
for
15
years
and
his
position
is
in
land
use
planning.
he
is
a
zoning
individual
on
the
city
staff.
he
did
not
articulate
any
reason
why
this
statute
makes
any
sense.
he
simply
said
that
in
his
15
years
with
experience
he
thinks
this
is
a
bad
use
of
the
land
in...
in
essence.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
it's...
it's
totally
unfounded
is
what
it
is.
in
reading
the
entire
record,
those
statements
are...
are
absolutely
unsupported
by
any...
he
has
never
even
been
there.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i
agree
that
you
con't
have
to
to
have
the
concern,
but
you
have
to
in
order
to
know
if
the
concern
is
real.
and
that's
what
has
happened
here.
in
fact,
in
roberts
it...
justice
brennan
makes
the
point
that
we
are
not
going
to...
to
deal
with
presumptions
and
presume
the
ill-effects
that
you
would
argue
will
occur.
in
that
case
the
jaycees
were
arguing
certain
ill-effects,
and
they
were
unable
to
demonstrate
them
in
the
record.
and
the
majority
opinion
said
we
do
not
make
constitutional--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--but
the
principle
remains
the
same
that
you
cannot
take
a
presumption
and...
a
presumption
from
the
record.
if
it
isn't
established,
then
it
isn't
there.
you
can't
presume
that,
well,
that's
probably
right.
and
i
don't
know
what
it
takes
to
establish
it,
but
i
know
it
isn't
in
the
record
that's
before
this
court.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
i
would
not
argue--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--i
would
not
argue
under
the
class
a,
b,
c.
i
would
not
argue
that
a
restriction
that
prevents
minor
from
entering
a
dance
hall
that
serves
alcoholic
beverages
or
has
topless
dancers
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
minors.
i
would
argue
that
if
the
twilight
skating
rink
opened
up,
even
in
absence
of
having
a
class
e
dance
hall
license,
and
they
had
a...
a
well...
fit,
secure
facility
for
the
sole
enjoyable
recreational
purpose
of
having
dance,
and
the
city
said,
no,
13
to
17-year
olds
cannot
go
in
there
for
any
reason,
that
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
restraint
on
their
liberty.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
same
thing.
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
we...
we--
mr.
daniel
j.
sheehan,
jr.
--we
have
to
give
some
recognition
to
the
role
of
parents
in
this
process.
a
six-year
old
is
not...
or
an
eight-year
old
is
not
unsupervised.
and
if
that
parent
believes
that
it's
a
fun
activity
and
there
are
other
children
there...
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
believe
that
younger
children's
exposure
to
older
children
is
positive,
that
they're
positive
role
models
and
it's
a
beneficial
relationship.
in
any
event,
the
point
that...
that
i...
that
i
want
to
be
sure
is
made
is
that
certainly
some
constitutional
protection
is...
is
involved
here.
the
difficulty
in
finding
the
appropriate
category
within
the
parameters
of
roberts
should
not
mean
that
this
social
association
should
not
be
recognized.
and
that's
what
the
city
is
saying.
it
isn't
expressive
as...
as
roberts
has
defined
it.
it
isn't
intimate
as
roberts
has
defined
it.
ergo,
it
isn't
a
constitutional
right.
the...
the
city
does
have
an
interest
in
protecting
their
young,
but
they...
the
statute
has
to
have
some
nexus.
the
protection
has
to
snow
that
in
some
means
it
accomplishes
that.
now,
these...
there's
no
showing
here,
first
of
all,
that
this
ordinance
is
going
to
accomplish
anything
in
my
opinion
other
than
presumptions.
well,
that
probably
isn't
good
that
these
people
can
be
with
older
people.
and
there's
no
showing
that
the
association
is
detrimental.
the
trial
court
who
ruled
in
favor
of
the
city
made
these
findings.
the
city
has
not
articulated
a
precise
basis
for
distinguishing
between
skating
and
dancing.
the
city's
argument
that
the
noise
levels
are
higher,
the
traffic
control
is
a
problem,
greater
neighborhood
disruption,
more
alcohol
and
drug
abuse
have
no
real
factual
support.
nevertheless,
the
trial
court
said,
its
witnesses
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
urban
planning
insist
that
a
distinction
exists.
and
it
is
my
belief
that
if
you
rely
upon
that,
and
if
that
evidence
is
good
enough,
then
the
rational
basis
test
is
a
fiction
because
the
government
can
always
put
somebody
on
the
stand
and
say
i'm
experienced
in
zoning
law,
and
i
don't
think
these
kids
should
be
allowed
with
older
kids.
and
i
can't
tell
you
why.
i
just...
i
just
think
there's
a
difference.
and
that's
all
we
have
here.
and
it
is
on
that
basis
that
the
trial
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
city.
that
discards
the
rational
basis
test
entirely.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
it
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
this
ordinance,
then
it
must
surely
be
unconstitutional.
if
there
is
no
reason,
then
the
government
has
no
basis
upon
which
to
legislate.
there
is
a
quotation
that
i've
noticed
in
several
cases
i've
read
and
i'm
unable
to
attribute
it
to
the
particular
case.
i
think
it
was
in
a
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1891
that
i
think
is
appropriate
here.
"the
makers
of
our
constitution
conferred
as
against
the
government
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
the
most
comprehensive
of
rights
and
the
right
most
valued
by
civilized
man.
"
and
i
believe
that
no
less
a
right
is
at
stake
in
this
case
than
that
right.
thank
you.
