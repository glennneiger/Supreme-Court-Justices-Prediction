well,
now,
do
you
say
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
protect
any
right
of
social
association?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
city
could
adopt
an
ordinance
telling
all
14-year
olds
that
they
may
not
under
any
circumstances
in
their
lives
have
any
association
with
people
over
18?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
there
is
a
right
of
social
association.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
equal
protection
is
a
constitutional
principle?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did...
was
this
ordinance
a
replacement
of
a
previous
regulation
that
was
more
restrictive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
this
ordinance
actually
was
more
generous
to
the
owner
than
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
previous
ordinance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hopkins,
in
your
brief
at
some
place
i
think
you
suggest
that
in
any
event
this
is
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
regulation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
you
found
any
of
our
cases
applying
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
regulations
to
a
so-called
right
of
association?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
have
ample
opportunity
to
do
that
in
school,
in
private
clubs,
at
a
home,
every
place,
just
not
a
class
e
dance
hall.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
certainly
is
a
factor
for
the
analysis.
they
have
ample
opportunity
to
dance.
whose
associational
rights
are
you
here
advocating?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
who
do
you
think
you're
representing?
the
right
of
everybody
to
go
to
the
class
e
dance
hall?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
of
course
the
court
has
applied
a
higher
level
of
scrutiny
to
gender
discrimination
and
racial
discrimination.
that's
not
involved
here,
is
it?
