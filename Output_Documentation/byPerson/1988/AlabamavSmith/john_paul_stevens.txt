justice
stevens
well,
how
often
are
there
guilty
pleas
entered
without
a
plea
bargain?
isn't
that
characteristic
of
guilty
pleas?
justice
stevens
so
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
that
makes
the
case
different
from
just
any
guilty
plea.
if
there
had
been
no
plea
bargain,
you
would
not
be
making
the
arguments
you're
making
today?
because
i
thought
the
base
of
your
argument
was
that
the
judge
became
aware
of
additional
facts
at
the
trial
that
changed
his
mind
on
the
appropriate
sentence.
couldn't
that
happen
without
plea--
justice
stevens
--was
there
any
factual
information
that
the
prosecutor
obtained
that
he
didn't
have
at
the
time
of
the
guilty
plea?
i
know
the
judge
didn't
have
as
much
knowledge
of
the
facts
until
this
trial.
is
there
any
indication
that
the
prosecutor
discovered
anything
that
he
could
not
have
advised
the
court
about
at
the
time
the
original
sentence
was
imposed?
justice
stevens
so
i
suppose
that
your...
the
rule
you
would...
you
would
argue
for
is
one
that,
as
long
as
the
prosecutor
doesn't
tell
the
judge
everything
that
might
come
out
of
the
trial
and
the
defendant
sets
aside
the
guilty
plea
by...
it's
unconstitutional
grounds
or
whatever
it
might
be,
there
could
always
be
an
increase
in
sentence
if
the
judge
thinks
it's
appropriate?
justice
stevens
but
what
the
judge
has.
justice
stevens
and
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that,
under
your
rule,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
if
the
prosecutor
just
withholds
from
the
judge...
not
purposely,
but
just
doesn't
tell
the
judge
all
of
the
facts
that
might
come
out
at
the
trial...
then
the
judge
learns
something
extra
about
the
defendant's
behavior
at
the
trial,
the
judge
could
always
enhance
the
sentence.
justice
stevens
right.
and
therefore
could
always
enhance
the
sentence.
justice
stevens
but
he
could,
he
could
always
overcome
whatever
would
be
left
of
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness
in
every
case.
justice
stevens
but
there's
a
guilty
plea
followed
by
a
trial
at
which
you
learn
something
more.
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
it.
well,
that,
that,
that's,
that's
not,
that's
not,
was
the
basis
of
our
disposition.
we
quoted
what
judge
johnson
had
said,
that
the
state
of
alabama
offered
no
evidence
attempting
to
justify
the
increase
and
that
he
found
it
shocking.
and
we
agreed
with
that
conclusion.
and
i...
i
don't
see
how
your
case
is
really...
can
be
decided
in
your
favor
without
overruling
pearce,
the
rice
portion
of
pearce.
justice
stevens
but
that's
also
an
explanation
that
would
be
present
in
every
guilty
plea
case.
justice
stevens
but,
ms.
boyd,
may
i...
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point?
what,
i
don't
understand
your
position.
is
it
your
view
that,
whenever
a
judge
takes
a
guilty
plea
and
has,
maybe,
a
hearing
to
be
sure
there's
enough
factual
support
to
take
the
plea,
that,
thereafter,
the
judge
is
disqualified
from
trying
the
case
if
the
plea
later
is
withdrawn?
because,
in
every
case,
the
judge
has
pretty
good
reason
to
believe
the
defendant's
guilty
if
he's
entered
a
plea.
justice
stevens
but
doesn't
he
have
a
duty
to
do
that?
isn't
that
a
normal
thing
to
do
for
a
trial
judge,
to
make
sure
the
defendant's
guilty
and
get
some
sense
of
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
to
inform
him
or
her
on
what
sentence
to
impose?
justice
stevens
by
the
defendant--
justice
stevens
--but
that
was
after
the
defendant
had
entered
a
guilty
plea.
justice
stevens
yes,
i
understand.
but
i,
i
don't
see
why
you're...
why
it's
wrong,
after
a
defendant
has
entered
a
guilty
plea,
for
the
judge
to
accept
what...
whatever
factual
information
might
come
to
his
attention
that
corroborated
the
fact
of
guilt.
i
just
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
well,
but
i
think
what
you're
really
arguing
is
that
the
sent...
the
judge
who
accepts
a
guilty
plea
should
never
handle
the
retrial.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
procedure
here?
maybe
it
doesn't
affect
the
legal
arguments,
but,
am
i...
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
third
charge
was
dismissed
during
the
plea
negotiations,
was
the
sodomy
charge,
and
after
trial
he
was
convicted
of
sodomy
and
given
a
life
sentence
on
that
charge,
and
you
don't
challenge
that
life
sentence?
justice
stevens
so
you...
so
you...
it's
not
before
it.
so,
regardless
of
how
we
decide
this
case,
this
gentleman
will
probably
spend
the
same
time
behind
bars.
justice
stevens
well,
they
do
run
concurrently,
don't
they?
justice
stevens
you
say
it...
it
does
or
does
not
affect?
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
if
you...
if
we
vacate
the
burglary
sentence,
if
you
totally
vacate
the
burglary
sentence,
the
sodomy
sentence
would
stand,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
yeah.
i
mean,
it...
it...
i
understand
the
legal
issue
is
there
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
but
it
really
doesn't
make
an
awful
lot
of
difference
to
your
client
how
we
try
this
case...
how
we
decide
this
case,
as
i
see
it.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
that
argument,
yeah.
but
it
wouldn't
affect
at
all
the
length
of
time
he
would
serve
on
the
sodomy
case.
