what...
what,
what
were
the

justice

think
the
rape
sentence
has
been...
set
aside

it
was
set
aside,
wasn't
it?
justice

right.
thanks.
justice
white
well,
the
alabama
supreme
court
seemed
to
think
that
it
should
decide,
uh,
the
validity
of
the
burglary
sentence.
justice
white
that
it
should.
justice
white
yes.
well,
but
the
sodomy
sentence
was
there.

did
they

been,
or
whether
they
would
now
be
procedurally
barred?
