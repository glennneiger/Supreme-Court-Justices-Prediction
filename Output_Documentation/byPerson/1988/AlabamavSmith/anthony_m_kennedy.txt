so
it's
not
important
that
there
was
a
plea
bargain
in
this
case?
that's--
justice
kennedy
--no,
a
plea
bargain.
justice
kennedy
is
that
relevant
to
your
case
or
is
your
case
the
same
as
if
there
had
just
been
a
guilty
plea?
justice
kennedy
how
is
this
case
different
from
pearce?
justice
kennedy
that,
that
wasn't
true
as
to
the
co-respondent
in
pearce,
rice.
justice
kennedy
in
pearce,
we
held
a
vindictiveness
rule
applied.
so
aren't
you
asking
us
to
overrule
pearce
in
part?
justice
kennedy
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
from
the
position
of
the
respondent,
rice,
in
pearce?
justice
kennedy
suppose
this
were
a
different
judge.
all
the
facts
are
the
same
except
there's
a
different
judge
on
the
second
time
around.
what...
what
results?
(a),
a
presumption?
justice
kennedy
well...
well,
getting
back
to
the
burglary
conviction,
the,
uh,
element
of,
the
offense
of
burglary
is
"entry
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime.
"
and
so
the
crime
that
was
committed,
it
seems
to
me,
does
necessarily
and
logically
enhance
the
burglary
sentence
itself.
so
that
the
trial
judge
was...
was
entitled,
based
on
this
record,
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
offense
that
was
committed
after
the
burglary
in
sentencing
for
the
burglary.
that's
part
of
the
definition
of
the
crime.
