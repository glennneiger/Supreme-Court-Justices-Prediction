mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
question
presented
in
this
case,
the
one
mr.
bjurberg
was
just
about
to
advert
to,
concerns
the
type
of
information
on
which
a
judge
may
rely
in
increasing
the
sentence
a
defendant
first
received
when
he
pled
guilty.
that
question
has
considerable
practical
importance
for
the
federal
government,
because,
under
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984,
a
judge
must
always
state
his
reasons
for
imposing
a
sentence.
so
the
circumstances
in
which
a
judge,
in
a
case
like
this,
may
increase
a
sentence,
directly
bears
on
that
second
question
and
is
of
considerable
importance
to
us.
the
respondent
argues
that,
when
a
defendant
withdraws
from
a
guilty
plea,
he
can
never
thereafter
have
a
sentence
increased
based
on
evidence
that
is
developed
at
a
trial
and
that,
even
if
he
can,
he
could
not
have
his
own
sentence
increased
in
this
case
because
the
reasons
given
by
the
trial
judge
were
insufficient.
we
think
that
respondent's
arguments
are
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
are
irrational
as
a
matter
of
policy.
the
mccullough
case
decided
by
this
court
three
years
ago
made
clear
that
a
trial
judge
at
a
second
sentencing
proceeding
may
impose
an
enhanced
sentence
on
a
defendant
if
the
judge
relies
on
new
and
objective
facts,
facts
that
were
unknown
to
the
judge
when
he
first
sentenced
the
defendant.
that
condition
was
satisfied
here.
as
mr.
bjurberg
explained,
at
the
time
the
judge
resentenced
the
defendant,
he
said
that
he
was
unaware
that
numerous
rapes
and
sodomies
had
occurred
on
the
night
in
question,
and
he
said
he
was
unaware
that
the
victim
had
been
threatened
with
a
knife.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
in
the
rice
case,
the
court
applied
a
presumption
and
the
court
said
that
the
state
of
alabama,
in
that
case,
at
no
time
sought
to
dispel
that
presumption.
here,
even
if
a
presumption
applies,
under
mccullough,
it's
clear
the
presumption
can
be
rebutted.
and,
therefore,
the
mccullough
case
and
the
rice
case
have
to
be
read
together.
if
rice
adopts
a
presumption
that
would
be
applicable
here,
and
we
don't
think
the
court
necessarily
has
to
agree
with
that,
but
even
if
it
does,
under
mccullough,
that
presumption
can
be
rebutted.
and
the
judge's
reasons
in
this
case
are
sufficient
under
mccullough
to
rebut
that
presumption.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
it...
it--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
we
don't
think
that
the
court
should
have
to
read
rice
to
govern
this
case.
justice
kennedy
asked
that
question,
and
i
don't
think
you
would
have
to
overrule
rice
in
order
to
rule
in
the
state's
favor
on
the
first
question.
there
are
two
different
aspect
of
the
ruling
in
pearce.
the
first
is
the
due
process
ruling
that
a
defendant
cannot
be
vindictively
sentenced
simply
for
having
successfully
set
aside
the
first
judgment.
that
is
a
basic
due
process
principle,
but
is
not
necessarily
this...
the
one
that
is
at
issue
in
a
case
like
this
one.
that
part,
as
justice
o'connor
asked,
deals
with
a
question
of
actual
vindictiveness,
and
a
defendant
can
always
attempt
to
show
actual
vindictiveness.
but
what's
at
concern
here
in
the
first
question
is
whether
you
should
presume
that
the
sentence
the
judge
imposed
at
the
second
sentencing
proceeding
was
retaliatory
in
nature.
now,
in
rice,
it
is
true,
the
court
did
apply
that
presumption.
but
rice
was
the
companion
case
to
pearce,
which
first
adopted
this
rule.
rice
preceded,
therefore,
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
like
bordeni
ircher
and
corbitt.
and
those
cases
are
significant
because
those
cases
make
clear
that
you
can
extend
leniency
to
a
defendant
who
accepts
responsibility
and
enters
a
plea,
and
you
can
deny
the
same
leniency
to
a
defendant
who
refuses
to
accept
responsibility
and,
instead,
elects
to
go
to
trial.
so
it's
that
type
of
rule
which
the
court
has
labeled
a
prophylactic
rule
that's
at
issue
in
the
first
question.
and,
just
as
the
court
has
been
willing
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
such
as
exclusionary
rule
or
the
application
of
miranda,
to
modify
prophylactic
rules
when
new
situations
show
that
it
may
be
irrational
to
apply
that
rule
in
other
contexts,
so,
too,
the
court
should
be
willing
to
modify
the
type
of
rule
that
was
applied
to
rice,
himself,
in
light
of
the
changed
circumstances
that
have
gone
on
in
the
20
some-odd
years
we've
had
since
the
pearce
case
was
decided.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
i
think
as
an
empirical
matter,
it...
the
correlation
between
this
rule
and
plea
bargains
is
going
to
be
very
high.
but
i
would
think
it,
it
could
also
apply
in
the
case
where
someone
just
enters
a
plea.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
if
you
distinguish
rice
that
way
and
you
exclude
the
plea
bargaining
process,
then,
yes.
but
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
for
excluding
the
plea
bargaining
process
is
that,
in
that
process,
it's
well-accepted...
in
fact,
the
dissent
in
the
court
below
stated
that
it
was
a
custom
to
afford
a
defendant
leniency
in
exchange
for
a
plea.
now,
there
will
also
be
cases
where
a
judge
extends
a
defendant
leniency
in
exchange
for
a
plea
where
there's
no
plea
bargain.
that
would
probably
happen
normally
in
what
would
be
called
misdemeanors
and
minor
offenses,
not
major
felonies,
where
someone
maybe
isn't
even
represented
by
a
lawyer,
who
pleads
guilty.
a
judge
may,
in
that
circumstance,
also
extend
leniency
to
a
defendant
simply
because
the
defendant
has
come
in
and
said,
"i
did
it.
"
"i'm
sorry;
i
won't
do
it
again
and
i
accept
responsibility.
"
in
fact,
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
have
elevated
this
custom
to
a
rule.
a
defendant
who
accepts
responsibility,
under
a
plea
bargain
or
not,
or
even
after
going
to
trial,
is
entitled
to
credit.
so,
if
you
were
to
limit
rice
in
the
way,
uh,
i
said,
just
to
plea
bargains,
then
you
wouldn't
have
to,
as
justice
kennedy
asked,
overrule
the
rice
case.
however,
it's
possible
that
the
rationale
for
limiting
rice
to
plea
bargains
would
also
apply
in
other
cases
where
there
was
no
plea
bargain,
because
a
judge,
in
fact,
bestowed
leniency
on
someone
for
pleading
guilty.
respondent
makes
much
ado
of
two
facts
in
trying
to
say
that
the
judge
did
not
adequately
rebut
the
presumption
here.
respondent
first
argues
that
the
judge
relied
on
his
subjective
impression
as
to
the
crimes.
that's
true,
but
it's
immaterial.
as
long
as
the
judge
relies
on
new
and
objective
information,
a
judge
is
entitled
to
re-evaluate
the
heinousness
of
the
crime
or
the
incorrigibility
of
the
defendant
in
coming
to
a...
a
decision
as
to
what
particular
sentence
best
serves
the
deterrent
and
retributive
functions
of
the
law.
the
respondent
also
argues
that
there
were
no
new
facts
elicited
regarding
the
burglary
rather
than
the
sexual
assaults.
that
fact
is
irrelevant.
what
the
judge
did
here,
essentially,
was
put
together
a
sentencing
package
to
try
to
decide
what
sentence
best
served
the...
the
functions
of
the
law
and
ensured,
in
this
particular
case,
for
example,
the
respondent
either
never
is
released
from
prison
or
is
released
only
after
serving
a
very
long
prison
term.
there's
no
requirement
in
this
court's
decisions,
and
in
fact,
the
decisions
in
wasman
and
mccullough
or
to
the
contrary,
that
the
new
facts
directly
relate
to
the
crime
for
which
the
defendant
is
sentenced.
the
mccullough
decision
and
the
wasman
decision
basically
show
that
what
the
court
has
done,
and,
i
believe,
sensibly,
has
been
to
re-evaluate
through
experience
the
circumstances
in
which
the
presumption
should
apply
and
at
which
the
presumption
can
be
rebutted.
that
type
of
re-evaluation
was
properly
applied
in
this
case.
the
judgment
below
should,
therefore,
be
reversed.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
a
defendant
can
always
argue
in
a
particular
case
that
this
judge,
notwithstanding
anything
else,
gave
me
five
extra
years
or
whatever,
simply
because
i
went
to
trial.
and
that's
not
permitted
by
pearce.
and
that's
the
type
of
claim
a
defendant
can
make.
once
the
evidence
is
all
considered,
is
then
for
an
appellate
court
to
make
that,
the
inquiry
whether
the
defendant
is
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
you
are
correct
on
both
counts.
it
was
not
made,
and
it's...
alabama
supreme
court
can
consider
it
on
remand.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
