ms.
delores
r.
boyd
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
begin
by
trying
to
restore
the
proper
factual
context
for
this
case
and
i
will
start
with
the
question
raised
by
justice
stevens,
whether
plea
bargaining
is
at
all
critical
to
this
court's
determination
of
the
case.
the
answer
is
absolutely
not.
plea
bargaining,
as
a
practice,
as
a
policy,
is
not
implicated
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
what
we
have
here
is
a
simple
guilty
plea
that
results
in
a
conviction.
the
defendant
is
charged
with
three
crimes.
the
plea
agreement
is
quite
simple.
he
pleads
guilty
to
two
of
those
crimes.
in
exchange,
the
prosecutor
agrees
to
drop
the
third.
there
is
no
concession--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--there
was
a
bargain
that
included--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--justice
o'connor,
that's
absolutely
correct.
what
is
distinguishable,
though,
is
that
the
bargain
did
not
include
any
negotiations
or
concessions
at
all
with
reference
to
sentencing.
why
that
is
critical
is
that
the
state
has
lost
absolutely
no
advantage.
when
that
guilty
plea
conviction
was
reversed,
all
the
state
did
was
reinstate
the
third
crime
and
the
defendant
then
went
to
trial
on
all
three
crimes.
so
we
don't
have
the
usual
situation,
as
is
suggested
in
the
cases
presented
by
both
the
government
and
the
state,
of
a
defendant
and
a
prosecutor,
sometimes
involving
the
judge,
hassling
about
a
sentence.
and
the
defendant
then
changing
his
mind
because
he
gets
a
sentence
that
he
didn't
believe
that
he
should
have
gotten,
then
wanting
to
withdraw
the
guilty
plea.
this
is
not
just
a
withdrawn
guilty
plea;
this
is
a
conviction
that
gets
reversed
because
the
sentencing
judge
made
errors
that
invalidated
the
guilty
plea
on
constitutional
grounds.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
justice
o'connor,
that
is
clear
on
the
record.
it's
important,
though,
that
that
crime
is
not
before
this
court.
it
wasn't
before
the
alabama
supreme
court,
and
it's
not
before
this
court.
this
court
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
have
just
one
conviction
and
one
sentence
to
deal
with.
that
is
the
sentence
that
had
to
do
with
burglary,
not
rape,
not
sodomy.
the
question
here
is
classic
pearce
question.
in
the
instance
when
a
sentencing
judge
applies
a
sentence
upon
a
conviction,
whether
it's
based
on
a
guilty
plea
or
based
on
a
jury
verdict,
may
that
same
sentencing
judge,
upon
reconviction,
come
back
and
enhance
the
sentence?
the
rice
case
that
dealt
with
pearce,
that,
that
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
pearce,
is
precisely
on
point.
i
take
issue
with
the
state
in
suggesting
that
this
is
not
the
rice
case.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
no,
sir.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
burglary
and
rape
and
sodomy
were
all
charged.
the
defendant
pled
guilty
to
burglary.
he
pled
guilty
to
rape.
the
sodomy
indictment
was
dismissed.
the
defendant
then
received
30-year
concurrent
sentences
on
burglary
and
rape.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
inquired
earlier
about
why
those--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--yes,
sir.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
concurrent.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
no,
sir...
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
sentence
was
a
30-year
sentence
for
burglary,
a
30-year
sentence
for
rape.
they
were
to
run
concurrently.
thereafter,
the
defendant
exercised
a
right
that
alabama
statutes
provided
him.
that
right
was
to
appeal
to
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
the
constitutional
sufficiency
of
the
conviction,
based
on
the
guilty
plea.
he
appealed
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
responding
to
your
earlier
question,
he
appealed
it
because
he
believed
that
he
was
not
mentally
coherent
when
the
guilty
plea
was
taken,
and
that,
therefore,
the
guilty
plea
itself
was
deficient.
now,
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
not
address
that
specific
contention
but
found,
nevertheless,
that
the
guilty
plea
was
constitutionally
deficient
because
the
trial
judge
had
absolutely
refused
or
declined
to
properly
inform
the
defendant
of
the
maximum
sentence
he
was
exposing
himself
to
by
pleading
guilty.
that's
a
constitutional
prerequisite.
therefore,
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
very
reluctantly
said,
"we
have
no
choice
but
to
vacate
this
conviction.
"
thereafter,
he
went
to
trial
on
all
three
cases.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
sodomy.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
sodomy
at
that
point
was
reinstituted
and
that
is
why,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
the
state
has
lost
nothing
in
its
bargain.
that
is
why
we
don't
have
to
inquire
whether
leniency
ought
to
be
given
to
the
defendant.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
the
new
sentences
were
these:
burglary,
life;
sodomy,
life,
to
run
concurrent.
on
the
rape,
150
years,
to
run
consecutive
to
the
other
sentences.
for
whatever
reason,
trial
counsel
chose
not
to
appeal
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
the
convictions
on
the
rape
and
the
convictions
on
the
sodomy.
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals,
in
fact,
remanded
the
rape
conviction,
indicating
that
that
150-year
sentence
exceeded
the
statutory
permissible
sentence.
so
the
only
sentence
that
should
command
our
attention
is
the
life
sentence
for
burglary.
and
why
does
pearce
apply?
pearce
applies--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--it
has
not
yet,
because
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
remanded
that.
thereafter,
the
state
petitioned
for
cert,
everything
has
been
put
on
hold.
but
the
trial--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--in
effect,
it
was
set
aside
as
statutorily
exceeding
the
maximum.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
why
does
pearce
apply?
in
this
case,
we
don't,
justice
scalia,
have
to
remand
the
case
to
the
alabama
supreme
court.
i
believe
justice
o'connor
raised
that
same
inquiry.
should
we
send
it
back
and
make
some
determination
on
actual
vindictiveness?
no.
that
determination
has
been
made.
this
defendant
raised
his
realistic
apprehension
of
retaliatory
motivation
at
the
trial
court.
he
raised
it
in
a
motion
for
new
trial;
he
raised
it
at
the
outset
when
he
tried
to
get
this
judge
to
recuse
himself.
and
he
had
very
good
reason
for
being
apprehensive.
so
that,
there...
there
are
really
two
reasons
pearce--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--justice
o'connor,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
detail
in
its
opinion
any...
any...
analysis
of
it,
but,
as
i
read
the
alabama
supreme
court
opinion,
the,
it
held
that
the
presumption
wasn't
overcome.
it
addressed
itself
to
whether
the
trial
court
could
rely
upon
the
information
elucidated
at
trial
about
the
details
of
the
offense.
before
it
could
make
that
inquiry,
it
had
to
consider
the
defendant's
arguments,
and
the
defendant's
arguments
were
simple.
we
believe
that
this
judge
is
penalizing
us
because
we
chose
to
appeal
the
guilty
plea
condition.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
the
pearce
presumption
is
a
presumption
of
vindictiveness
upon
the
occurrence
of
certain
factors.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
its
opinion
does
not
set
forth
an
analysis.
the
fact
that
it
looked
at
it
has
to
be
suggested
by
the
fact
that
it
went
on
to
determine
whether
it
was
overcome.
it
determined
whether
the
trial
court
could
rely
upon
details
of
the
crime
as
they
were
elucidated
at
trial.
another
reason
we
know
that
that
is--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--pearce--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--what
the
alabama
court
did,
your
honor,
was
say
that
the
evidence
that
was
offered
by
the
state--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--was
not
enough.
so
presumption
wasn't
overcome.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
yes.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
is
ample
evidence
on
this
record
to
support
the
supreme
court's
finding.
now,
to,
to
answer
you
directly,
if
you
disagree
with
that,
the
proper
inquiry
would
be
to
send
it
back
for
specific
findings
on
the
presence
of
vindictiveness.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
but,
in
so
doing,
you
would
not,
based
on
your
own
case
law,
be
asking
the
alabama
supreme
court
to
actually
find
actual
vindictiveness,
because--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--yes,
your
honor.
the
point
i'm
about
to
make
is
that...
actual
vindictiveness,
because
it
is
so
difficult
to
ascertain,
can
be
a
function
of
a
finding
that
there
are
realistic
indicators
here
that
support
a
likelihood
of
vindictiveness.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
i
agree.
and
that
is
what
mccullough
and
that's
what
most
of
the
post...
case
law
after
pearce
say.
my
point
is,
if
you
believe
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
not
make
a
finding
of
actual
vindictiveness,
i
am
simply
suggesting
that
the
record
here
shows
that
the
finding
was
based
on
realistic
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
that
there,
there
is
enough
in
the
record
to
support
that
finding.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
the
presumption
should
apply,
your
honor--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--well,
let...
let...
let
me
go
directly
to
some
reasoning
for
why
the
presumption
should
apply.
when
this
court,
in
pearce,
talked
about
whether
we
look
to
an
actual
evidence
of
motivation
or
whether
there
are
other
indicators,
it
gave
guidance
in
the
case
law
that
followed.
one
reason
this
presumption
ought
to
apply
here
is
that
we
have
the
very
same
sentencing
authority
who
has
demonstrated
on
this
record
both
a
personal
interest
and
an
institutional
interest
in
having
a
retaliatory
motivation
against
this
defendant.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
this
court
has
held
that
a
different
judge
would
make
a
difference.
i
believe
that,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
would
be
a
lesser
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
with
a
different
judge.
i'm
not
willing
to
embrace,
as...
as
a
general
rule,
a
different
judge
makes
a
difference.
but,
in
this
case,
this
particular
judge
had
so
integrated
himself
on
the
issue
of
guilt
at
the
first
sentencing
hearing
that
i
think
these
facts
are
distinguishable.
these
facts
require
the
presumption--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--although
this
court's
opinion
in
mccullough,
the
majority
opinion
was
not
embraced
by
this
entire
court,
it
specifically
suggested
that
it
is
a
case-by-case
analysis
that
ought
to
be
employed
because
of
the
difficulty
in
ascertaining
actual
vindictiveness.
this
case
almost
cries
out
for
an
analysis
of
this
judge's
role.
here
is
a
judge
who
admits
on
the
record,
before
he
makes
the
first
sentence,
that
he
has
received
from
the
defendant,
without
knowledge
of
the
defendant's
lawyers,
letters,
which,
in,
in
his
own
statement,
bear
out,
substantiate
and
corroborate
the
defendant's
guilt.
here's
a
judge
who,
at
the
initial
sentencing
hearing,
expresses
on
the
record
that
he
himself
is
convinced
of
the
defendant's
guilty
calls
up
to
the
bench
someone
totally
unrelated
to
the
proceedings,
the
defendant's
alleged
girlfriend,
hands
her
the
letters
that
the
court
has
received
ex
parte,
and
says
to
her,
"you
read
them".
and
after
she
concludes
them,
makes
the
inquiry,
"now,
are
you
as
satisfied
as
i
am
that
he
is
guilty?
"
here
is
a
judge
who
moves
on
on
a
motion
for
a
recusal
after
the
conviction
is
overturned,
and
again
indicates,
"i
received
your
letters.
"
"i
know
you're
guilty.
"
what...
what
greater
interest
does
he
need
to
invince
when
he
has
to
sit
through
a
trial,
presumably
to
determine
an
issue
that
he's
already
made
up
his
mind
on.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
no,
your
honor.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
there
needs
to
be
an
analysis
of
whether
the
sentencing
judge
has
so
completely
engaged
himself
in
the
factual
issue
about
the
guilt
at
the
initial
sentencing
hearing
that
his
impartiality--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--what
is
not
normal
is
what
the
trial
judge
did
here.
in
addition
to
taking
the
guilty
plea
and
ascertaining
the
factual
basis,
he
read
letters
that
were
sent
to
him--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--by
the
defendant,
without,
uh,
advice
of
counsel,
without
knowledge
of
counsel,
and
he
stated
his
own
adoption
of...
of
the
implications
of
guilt
that
came
in
those
letters.
and
that
guided
him
as
he
went
to
the
retrial.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
it
was
before
his
sentencing,
however.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
well,
if
that
judge
was
not
the
same
judge,
to
proceed
with
the
retrial--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--no,
i'm
not
arguing
that,
your
honor.
this
judge
should
not
have
handled
the
retrial.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
what
this
judge
did
went
beyond
the
initial
guilty
plea,
your
honor.
the
defendant
had
an
apprehension--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--well,
what
do
we
do
with
the
defendant's
due
process
right
to
believe
that
he
is
going
to
have
a
fair
trial
at
the
hand
of
a
judge
who
has
no
predisposition--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--that
is
the
preferred
procedure.
that
is
not,
from
a
policy
point
of
view,
a
practical
procedure.
and
that
is
why
i
did
not
embrace
that,
is
what
i'm
asking
this
court
to
do.
this
court
doesn't
even
have
to
go
that
far.
this
court
need
only
analyze
what
information
the
judge
had
at
the
time
of
the
second
sentencing
and
whether
that
information
disqualified
him
from
making
a
sentence
free
from
vindictiveness.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
he
was
asked
to
do
so
and
he
was
asked
to
do
because
the
defendant
had
a
reasonable
basis
for--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--the
pearce
presumption,
your
honor,
as
i
read
rice
and
the
underlying
case,
is
grounded
on
a
due
process
right
that
recognizes
not
only
actual
vindictiveness,
but
a
defendant's
perception
of
vindictiveness.
so,
by
asking
this
judge
to
disqualify
himself,
the
defendant
himself
was
indicating
his
own
belief
that
he
could
not
have
a
fair
trial
at
the
hands
of
this
judge.
why
does
that...
why
does
that
matter
for
the
pearce
presumption?
it
matters
for
the
pearce
presumption
because
it
goes
to
whether
there
is
a
realistic
likelihood
of
actual
vindictiveness.
a
retrial
here
was
necessary
solely
because
the
sentencing
judge
made
errors
of
a
constitutional
magnitude.
that
was
a
finding
of
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals.
and
it
was
a
finding
that
was
very
scathing
as
to
the
omissions
of
the
trial
judge.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
it
was
not
challenged
below
and
that's
why
it's
not
here.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
well,
the
difference
is
that,
uh,
the
sentences
were
to
run
concurrently.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
burglary
and,
and
sodomy,
at
the
second
sentencing
were
both
life
sentences
running
concurrently.
the
150-year
rape
sentence
was
a
consecutive
sentence.
so
what
your...
what
your
determination
is
on
the
burglary
affects
the
sodomy
anyway,
and
i'm
sure
that
is
perhaps
why
trial
counsel
did
not
raise
that
in
the
courts
below.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
it
does...
it
does
affect
it
because
it's
the
sentence
that's
running
concurrently.
it
is
the
same
sentence.
life.
and
it's
running
concurrently
with
the
one
that's--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--the
sodomy
sentence
would
stand.
i
believe
that
it
would
have
to
back...
to
the
court
for...
the
sodomy
sentence
would
stand.
it,
it
is
simply
a
concurrent-running
sentence.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
well,
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
if...
if...
if
this
court
is
still
to
give
any
credence
to
whether
we
ought
to
be
concerned
about
the
defendant's
right
to
be
free
from
the
apprehension
of
a
retaliatory
motivation,
it
matters
to
mr.
smith
whether
the
burglary
sentence--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--it
would
not,
but
then,
again,
this...
he
is
still
free
to
make
some
appellate,
uh,
challenges
on
the
sodomy
sentence,
because
we
haven't
gone
back
on
remand
yet.
he's
still
free,
perhaps,
because
the
trial
court
has
not
entered
any
orders
after
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
after
the
alabama
supreme
court's,
uh,
vacation.
he's
still
free,
perhaps,
to,
uh,
deal
with
the
federal
habeas
charge.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
that
it
should
or
should
not?
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
that
was
the
only
thing
before
it.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
i
was
not
trial
counsel.
i
do
not
know
why
that
was
not
brought
up
to
the
alabama
supreme
court.
but
the
defendant
may
still
have
federal
habeas
challenges
to
deal
with
the
sodomy.
so
it
does
matter
what
this
court
does
with
burglary.
the
burglary
sentence
was
enhanced,
and
it
was--
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
--and
whether
they
have
been
exhausted
is
still
in
question,
because
it
hasn't
gone
back
on
remand.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
i
think
both
issues
are
still
open
because
of
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case.
so
it
does
matter
what
this
court
does.
let
me
turn
to
the
issue
of,
if
pearce
applies,
has
it
been
overcome?
in
that
connection,
we
do
not
advance
the
absolute
rule
that
the
government
suggests,
and
that
is
that
a
trial
court
should
never
be
free
to
consider
facts
of
the
offense
as
they
are
revealed
at
trial.
that
is
not
our
argument.
our
argument
is,
number
one,
pearce
requires
the
trial
court
to
affirmatively
record
on
the
record,
and
this
trial
judge
didn't
do
it.
we're
not
talking
about
rape,
we're
not
talking
about
sodomy.
the
question
is
whether
this
trial
judge
advanced
anything
at
all
on
the
record
to
justify
enhancing
a
30-year
burglary
sentence
to
life.
the
record
is
absolutely
void
and,
under
pearce,
that
should
end
the
inquiry.
the
government
and
the
state
suggested
this
is
some
type
of
package
deal
and
the...
and...
and
the
trial
court
should
have
had
the
right
to
listen
to
the
details
of
the
rape
at
trial
and
consider
that
enhancing
the
sentence.
why
that's
fallacious
is
that
all
three
crimes
called
for
separate
penalties.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
justice
scalia,
that
may
be
the
case,
but
we
don't
need
to
speculate
that
this
trial
judge
did
consider
those
other
crimes.
there's
nothing
on
the
record
that
suggests
that
he
decided
to
enhance
the
burglary
because
of
evidence
he
heard
on
rape
because
he
also
enhanced
the
rape.
it
could
very
well
be
that
the
evidence
he
heard
on
rape
and
sodomy
was
so
atrocious
that
he
decided
to
make
the
enhancement
there.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
well,
pearce
requires
him
to
justify
each
sentence.
we
shouldn't
have
to
speculate
that
the
justification
for
burglary...
especially
since
the
record
doesn't
show
any
new
evidence...
that
the
justification
for
burglary
ought
to
be
the
justification
for
rape.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
that
is
a
correct
statement.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
yes.
initially,
the
concurrent
sentences
were
for
burglary
and
rape.
initially,
your
honor,
that
was
the
30-year
concurrent
sentence.
upon
retrial,
what
ran
concurrently
were
the
burglary
and
sodomy
and
the
consecutive
sentence
was
rape.
that
is
what
you're
reading
now,
the
alabama
supreme
court,
upon...
after
the
second
sentencing.
ms.
delores
r.
boyd
justice
kennedy,
the
legislative
scheme
for...
for
punishment
of
burglary,
rape
and
sodomy
considered...
took
into
consideration
the
fact
that
a
burglary
is
entry
of
a
residence
to
commit
another
crime,
and,
in
doing
so,
categorized
it
as
a
class
a
felony,
separately
punishable.
we
could
just
as
easily
say
that
the
judge
decided
to
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
this
defendant
had
taken
an
appeal
of
a
burglary
conviction
and
had
embarrassed
him
before
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
by
having
that
court
remind
the
trial
judge
that
the
guilty
plea
was
constitutionally
deficient.
that
is
so...
that
is
why
it
is
important
that
the
information
that
the
trial
judge
rely
upon
be
specifically
stated
as
to
the
crime.
now,
if
you
believe
that
what
he
stated
was
adequate,
then
test
it
by
whether
it
was
objective
and
whether
it
was
new,
whether
was
anything
at
all
that
he
didn't
know
before.
all
we
have
is
he
didn't
know
that
there
were
five
rapes.
now
he
knows
that.
that
may
justify
enhancing
the
rape,
but
it
shouldn't
justify
enhancing
the
burglary
against
the
backdrop
of
those
other
factors.
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
you
cannot
divorce
a
determination
in
this
case
of
whether
the
additional
information
was
adequate
from
whether
there
existed
indicators
of
a
retaliatory
motivation
for
this
trial
judge.
to...
to
do
so
would
simply
give
the
trial
judge
a
convenience
excuse
to
mask
his
vindictiveness.
he
is
always
going
to
hear
more
at
trial
than
he
is
going
to
get
at
the
guilty
plea.
there
is
always
going
to
be
more
about
the
flavor
of
the
trial...
of...
of
the
offense
itself,
more
details.
so
if
he
has
a
reason
to
be
vindictive
against
this
defendant
in
the
first
instance,
all
he
need
say
is,
"well,
now
i've
heard
more
evidence
at
trial.
"
"i
understand
now
you
did
five
rapes.
"
"there
were
two
or
three
other
crimes.
"
that
is
why
the
rule
that
we
advance
is
not
an
absolute
rule.
it
is
a
case-by-case
proposition.
thank
you.
