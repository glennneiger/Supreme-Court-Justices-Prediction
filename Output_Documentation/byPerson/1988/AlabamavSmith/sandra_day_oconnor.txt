justice
o'connor
now,
the,
the
respondent
tells
us
that
there
is
some
evidence
of
actual
vindictiveness
here.
would
that
question,
even
if
you
were,
even
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you,
be
open
on
remand
to
resolve?
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
a
bargain?
justice
o'connor
that's
the
bargain.
he
gives
up...
he
gives
up
the
right
to
trial
in
exchange
for
pleading
to
two
instead
of
three
offenses.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
concede
that,
at
least
as
to
the
third
charge
that
was
restored
when
he
went
to
trial,
that
the
judge
had
complete
flexibility
within
the
statutory
sentencing
scheme
to
sentence
for
that
offense?
justice
o'connor
it
was
a...
a
sentence
of
from
two
to
30
years?
justice
o'connor
but
i
didn't
think
the
court
of
appeals
had
addressed
itself
to
that
question
of
actual
vindictiveness.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
applied
the
pearce
presumption
and
that
that
was
how
the
case
was
resolved.
i
didn't
understand
it
to
have
addressed
the
actual
vindictiveness
question.
justice
o'connor
right.
i
didn't
understand
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
ever
looked
at
the
question
of
whether
there
was
actual
vindictiveness
here.
justice
o'connor
but
i
thought
that,
in
considering
whether
the
pearce
presumption
should
apply
in
a
given
situation,
we
look
to
the
generality
of
cases
and
the
likelihood
of
whether,
in
all
cases,
there
is
such
a
realistic...
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
that
we
should,
in
fact,
apply
a
presumption.
i
didn't
think
we
did
it
case
by
case
to
say,
"gee,
on
these
facts,
should
we
have
a
presumption?
"
