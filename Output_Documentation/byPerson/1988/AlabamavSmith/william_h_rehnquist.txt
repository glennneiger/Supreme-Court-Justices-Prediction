chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-333,
alabama
against
james
lewis
smith.
chief
justice
rehnquist
let
me
get
one
thing
straight
in
my
mind,
mr.
bjurberg.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
original
appeal
to
the
alabama,
it
was
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
this
case,
was
on
the
basis
that
the
guilty
plea
had
not
been
knowingly
made?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
he...
he
appealed
his
sentence
on
the
guilty
plea
and
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
upheld
his
appeal,
and,
what,
sent
it
back
for
resentencing
without
that
guilty
plea?
chief
justice
rehnquist
re...
sure,
for
a
trial--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--rather
than
a
plea.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bjurberg.
mr.
larkin?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
that
approach
is
consistent
with
the
court's
decision
in
the
rice
case,
the
companion
case
to
pearce?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
larkin.
ms.
boyd,
we'll
hear
from
you
when
we
resume
at
1:00
o'clock.
we'll
resume
the
argument
in
alabama
against
smith.
ms.
boyd.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
about
the
sodomy
charge,
uh,
ms.
boyd?
the...
that...
that
was
the
subject
of...
of
the
original,
one
of
those...
one
of
the
counts
that
was
subject
to
the
original
guilty
plea,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
was
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what,
what
charge
was
added,
again?
chief
justice
rehnquist
sodomy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
unless
we
disagreed
that
pearce
as
applicable
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
there...
those
are
two
different
inquiries.
one
is,
one
is
whether
the...
a...
vindictiveness
is
so
likely
under
a
particular
set
of
facts,
that
there
ought
to
be
a
presumption
of
vindictiveness.
and
then,
there...
it's...
even
if
you
say,
no,
there
are
no
other
explanations
in
cases
like
this,
so
you
don't
apply
a
presumption
of
vindictiveness.
you
could
still
find
actual
vindictiveness.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
opposed
to
the...
that
goes
to
whether
the
presumption
should
apply
and
not
to
whether
there
was,
in
fact,
actual
vindictiveness.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that...
that...
that's
what
you
say.
but
the...
state
disagrees.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that...
that,
but
that...
you...
you're
almost
arguing
that
the
judge
should
have
disqualified
himself,
uh,
from
trying
the
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
but
that,
that,
that
isn't
the
point
here.
the,
the
alabama
courts
didn't
decide
in
your
client's
favor
on
the
basis
that
the
judge
should
have
disqualified
himself.
they
decided
in
your
client's
favor
on
the
basis
that
the
pearce
presumption
applied.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the...
the...
the
150-year
consecutive
sentence
is
for
rape?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
boyd.
uh,
mr.
bjurberg,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
the
case
is
submitted.
