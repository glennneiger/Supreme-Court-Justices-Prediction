justice
scalia
you're
saying
this
rule
would
apply
only
to
plea
bargains,
then?
justice
scalia
not
if
you
distinguish
it...
not
if
you
distinguish
rice
the
way
you've
just
proposed.
justice
scalia
mr.
larkin,
if
we
agree
with
you,
why
shouldn't
we
give
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
the
chance
to
decide
on
this
thing
without
the
benefit
of
the
presumption?
i
mean,
even
if
we
agree
that
the
presumption
shouldn't,
should
not
have
been
applied,
shouldn't
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
have
the
chance
to
decide
for
itself
whether,
even
absent
of
presumption,
there
is
evidence
of...
of
bias
here?
justice
scalia
and
that
inquiry
hasn't
been
made
here,
so...
so
it
would
still
be
available
to...
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
make
that
inquiry,
no?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
i...
i...
i...
i'm...
i...
i'm
not
sure
i'm
understanding
you.
if
you
have
a
presumption,
you
don't
have
to
listen
to
the
defendant's
evidence.
i
mean,
he...
he
may...
say,
"boy,
this
judge
was
really
vindictive.
"
and
the
judge
would
say,
"i
don't
have
to
listen
to
that.
"
we
take
as
a
given
that
he's
vindictive.
that's
what
the
presumption
means.
justice
scalia
it's
up
to
the
state
to
refute
that
presumption.
isn't
that
what
the
alabama
court
did?
that's
what
i
thought
it
did.
justice
scalia
was
not
enough.
justice
scalia
to
overcome
the
presumption.
right.
justice
scalia
but,
now,
if
we
disagree
with
that...
and
this
is
what
justice
o'connor
and
i
were
getting
to...
if
we
disagree
with
that,
if
we
think
there
shouldn't
have
been
a
presumption,
we
would
still
have
to
send
it
back
so
that
alabama
could
then
consider,
had
there
not
been
a
presumption,
would
we
have
found
on
the
facts
that
there
was
vindictiveness.
don't...
don't
you
think
we'd
have
to
do
that?
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
all
the
things
that
you
say
that
this
judge
did
only
go
to
convincing
him
that
this
defendant
was
guilty.
but
a
judge
should
always
be
convinced
that
the
defendant's
guilty
before
he
accepts
a
guilty
plea.
you
don't
want
a
judge
accepting
a
guilty
plea
unless
he
believes
the
defendant's
guilty,
do
you?
so
that's...
so
the
situation
you're
complaining
about
will
always
exist
when
there's
been
an
acceptance
of
a
guilty
plea.
justice
scalia
well,
so
much
the
better.
he
was
really
sure
the
guy
was
guilty.
you're
not,
i,
i--
justice
scalia
--i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
just
talking
about
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question.
don't
you
have
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question?
yes.
whenever
you're
sent
back,
you
can
have
the
same
judge
who's
accepted
your
guilty
plea.
justice
scalia
well,
but
we...
we
allow
even,
even
when
crimes
are...
are
not
prosecuted
simultaneously
with
the...
with
the
crime
that
he's
being
sentenced
for,
and,
indeed,
even
when
he
hasn't
been
convicted
of
them
yet,
we...
we
allow,
at
the
penalty
phase,
other
crimes
to
be
considered,
or
other
unlawful
conduct
to
be
considered
in
deciding
what...
what
punishment
to
impose
for
this
one.
justice
scalia
well,
look
it...
he,
he
did
say,
"i
didn't
know
that
there
had
been
so
many
rapes.
"
"i
didn't
know
there
had
been
sodomy
before.
"
and
your
only
complaint
is
that
he
didn't
go
ahead
and
say,
"and
for
that
reason,
i
am
imposing
a
higher
sentence,
not
only
on
rape
and
sodomy
but
also
on
the
burglary
count.
"
uh,
it,
it
is
just
his
failure
to
mention
the
word
"burglary"
is,
is
what
your
case
comes
down
to?
justice
scalia
it
shows
new
evidence
of
other
crimes.
ms....
ms....
ms....
boyd...
now,
i
am
reading
from
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
opinion...
the...
page
3
of
the
appendix.
and,
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
justice
jones
and
his
opinion
giving
a
summary
of
what
had
happened.
"after
a
sentencing
hearing,
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
for
the
conviction
of
first-degree
sodomy,
which
term
was
to
run
concurrently
with
a
life
term
for
the
first-degree
burglary
conviction.
"
"the
petitioner
was
also
sentenced
to
a
term
of
150
years
for
the
conviction
of
first-degree
rape.
"
now,
is...
is
that
the...
these,
that's
a
correct
statement
of
what
happened?
