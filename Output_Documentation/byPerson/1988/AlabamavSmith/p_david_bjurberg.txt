mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce,
this
court
established
a
prophylactic
rule,
a
presumption
of
vindictiveness
to
correct
due
process
violations
by
courts
that
sentenced
a
defendant
to
more
than...
more
time
after
a
successful
appeal.
the
evil
sought
to
be
corrected
was
retaliation
in
success...
for
successfully
appealing.
in
this
case,
smith,
that
is,
the
respondent,
appealed
his
guilty
plea,
and,
upon
retrial,
his
sentence
on
the
burglary
charge
was
enhanced
from
30
years
to
life.
he
was
also
sentenced
to
life
on
a
reinstated
sodomy
charge
and
given
150
years
on
the
rape
conviction
to
run
consecutively
to
the
other
charges.
later
cases
by
this
court
has
established
that
the
pearce
presumption
only
applies
to
situations
in
which
a
realistic
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
exists
because
of
the
severity
of
the
presumption,
which
may
operate
in
the
absence
of
proof
of
improper
motive,
and,
thereby,
block
a
legitimate
state
response
to
criminal
conduct.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
yes.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
the
narrow
basis
was
that
the
defendant
was
not
told
the
correct
minimum
and
maximum
possible
range
of
sentences
under
our
habitual
felony
offender
statute
and
an
enhancement
statute
when
a
weapon
or
dangerous
instrument
is
used.
it
was
not
based
on
a
violation
of
boykin.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
they,
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
sent
back
for
a
retrial.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
right.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
yes.
what
the
petitioner,
the
state
of
alabama,
is
asking
this
court
to
consider
in
this
particular
case
is,
in
a
retrial
after
a
guilty
plea,
that
since
there
are
other
readily
apparent
explanations
for
the
increased...
increased
sentence
on
the
retrial,
that
there
is
no
need
for
the
evidentiary
aid,
namely,
the
presumption
that
pearce
created.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
it
is
important
that
there
was
a
plea.
that's
the
underlying
premise,
i
guess--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--i'm
sorry,
the...
yeah,
there
was
a
plea
bargain.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
it's
important
that
there
was
a
plea
bargain
in
our
case,
because,
in
the
plea
bargain,
the
prosecutor
and
the
court
are
oftentimes,
or
always,
almost,
engaging
in
exchange
for
that
plea
bargain,
either
sentencing
concessions
or
charge
concessions,
as
in
this
case.
so
the
fact
that
there
is
a
plea
bargain,
i
think,
is
very
important,
in
that
it
throws
this
case
into
the
u.s.
v.
brady
and
the
santobello
line
of
cases,
where
it's
acceptable
to,
in
exchange
for
a
guilty
plea,
to
offer
sentencing
concessions
and
to...
charge
concessions.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
i
would
say
the
very
vast
majority
are
entered
with
a
plea
bargain,
yes,
sir.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
but
the
basis
really
is
that
the,
the
resulting
increase
in
the
sentence
after
the
trial
is
based
on
this
guilty
plea
because
of
the
lack
of
information
established
at
the,
factual
information
established
at
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
not
in
this
record,
no,
sir,
no.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
the
focus
of
our
case
really
is
not
the
knowledge
or
the
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
the
prosecutor
might
have,
but--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--but
what
the
judge
has--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--the
judge
will
always
be,
in
our
position,
in
our
situation,
in...
have
knowledge
of
more
facts
in
a
trial
situation.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
yes,
yes.
and
that's
one
of
the
bases,
the
basic...
well,
what
i've
characterized
as
the
readily
apparent
other
reasons
other
than
vindictiveness,
which
is
the,
the
heart
of
pearce.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
well,
the
rule
we're
arguing
for
is
that--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--yes.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
this
case
essentially
is
different
from
pearce
in
that,
in
pearce,
there
was
an
initial
trial
and
an
appeal
and
then
a
subsequent
trial.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
rice
pleaded
guilty,
correct.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
no,
we're
not
asking--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--the
narrow
focus
of
this
court
in
rice
was
on
whether
or
not
a
defendant
under
due
process
was
entitled
to
credit
for
time
served.
in...
in...
in...
as
rice
came
through
the
system,
rice
was
not
given
credit
for
his
time
served.
and
the
narrow
focus,
really,
in
rice,
is,
he's...
he's
constitutionally
entitled
to
that
time.
the
other
aspect--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--right.
part
of
what
was
not
in
rice
that...
that
we
feel
is
in
our
particular
case
is
the
influence
of
the...
the
plea
bargaining
that...
that
was
not
sanctioned
by
this
court
until
u.s.
v.
brady,
which
was
subsequent
to
pearce.
so
that
it's
that
aspect
of
the
plea
bargaining
that
becomes
important
and
which
distinguishes,
or...
or
which
allows
this
court
to
rule
our
way
without
overruling
rice.
the
other
readily
apparent
fact
that
the
reason
for
the
increased
sentence
is
not
as
a
result
of
vindictiveness
is
that,
in
the
guilty
pleas
context...
the
judge...
and
prosecutor,
but
primarily
the
judge
since
we're
discussing
sentencers...
is...
is
extending
leniency
in
exchange
for
that
guilty
plea.
ands
this
court
in
u.s.
v....
in
its
previous
decisions,
has
held
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
extend
leniency
or
sentencing
concessions
to
those
who
do...
who
plead
guilty.
that
was
in
corbitt
v.
new
jersey.
and
that
is
the
other,
readily
apparent
explanation
for
the
increased
sentence
at
the
subsequent
trial,
retrial.
so
the
fact--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--yes.
the
other
readily
apparent
explanation
other
than
vindictiveness,
which
i've
pointed
to
in
our
brief,
is
that
the...
after,
at
the
trial,
or
the,
the
retrial
of
the
case,
the
court,
then,
is
much
more
aware
of
the
defendant's
mental
and
moral
attitudes
concerning
his
own...
rehabilitation
and
attitudes
in
the
case.
and
this
is
illustrated
by
the
facts
in
this
particular
case.
the
judge
stated
that
his
decision
in
increasing
the
sentence
on
the
retrial
was
partly...
partially
based
on
the
defendant's
outlook
on
it,
i
assume,
meaning
the...
the
case,
the
defendant's
position
during
trial
and
"what
you
said
at
it",
meaning
the
trial,
an
apparent
reference
to
the,
what
the
judge
considered
to
be
the
defendant's
perjury--
so
that,
that,
this
explanation
also
is
readily
apparent
on
the
retrial
of
any...
of
a
case.
and
this
is
a
sufficient
explanation
for
the
enhanced
sentence
versus
a
presumption
that
the
enhanced
sentence
is,
in
fact,
a...
the
product
of
vindictiveness.
as
mr.
justice--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--i
believe
it
would
be,
that
the...
the
alabama
supreme
court
could
then
engage
in...
in,
or
remand
it
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
for
them
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
evidence
of
actual
vindictiveness.
and
i
think
that's
another
aspect
of
this
case,
that's
not
before
this
court,
the...
part
of
the
pearce
was
protecting
the
defendant
from
the
fear
or
the
apprehension
of...
of
vindictive
sentence.
but
that
is
not
present
in
this
case,
because,
obviously,
the
defendant
was
not
afraid
of...
of
appealing.
and
in
fact,
in...
i
think
it
was...
well,
i
don't
have...
michigan
v.
payne,
this
court
made
the
same
type
of
statement
that
the...
so,
the
only
issue,
really,
before
this
court,
then,
would
be
the
issue
of
vindictiveness,
not
the
apprehension
of
the
vindictiveness.
i
believe
that
the
facts
of
this
case
fully
support
or
illustrate
the...
the
points
that
i'm
trying
to
make,
namely
that,
at
retrial,
the
judge
will
always
be
in
possession
of
more
knowledge
concerning
the
facts
and
the
defendant's
attitudes
concerning
his
participation
in
the
crime
than
he
is
in
the
guilty
plea
proceeding
that
started
the
process.
in
our
case,
at
the
guilty
plea
sentencing,
the...
the
defendant
did
admit
that
he
had
the
kni,
had
a
knife.
he
did
admit
to
having
sexual
intercourse
with
the
victim
in
this
crime.
however,
what
was
left
out
and
which
was
subsequently
developed
at
the
trial
was
the
atrociousness
in
the...
of
the...
of
the
crime,
the
fact
that
this
attack
lasted
for
over
an
hour,
and
the
fact
that,
not
just
one
act
of
non-consentual
sexual
intercourse
occurred,
but
that
four
acts
of
rape
and
two
acts
of
sodomy
were
performed
on
this
woman
while
the
defendant
was
holding
a
knife
to
her
throat.
now,
that's...
that
idea
is
contested
by
the
respondent,
the
idea
of
the...
knife
being
held
to
the
defendant's
throat.
but
the,
there
was
a
demonstration
by
the
victim
in
the
record,
which,
the...
the
judge,
observing
it,
later,
in
the
motion
for
new
trial,
determined
that
that
was
what
was
going...
what
was
happening.
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
victim
was...
i
mean,
the
defendant
was
threatening
the
victim
throughout
the...
this
ordeal
with
the
use
of
a
knife.
so
it's...
it's
that
relationship
between
the
lack
of
information
at
a
guilty
plea
versus
the
full
information
that
the
trial
judge
or
the
sentencing
judge
will
have
that
makes
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness
not
appropriate
in...
in
this
narrow
situation.
the
other...
the
other
issue
we
petition,
well,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebut.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
