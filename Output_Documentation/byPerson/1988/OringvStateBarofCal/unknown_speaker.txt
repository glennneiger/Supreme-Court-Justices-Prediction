unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
is
that
a
constitutional
rule?
does
that
comport
with
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well
so,
in
your
view,
for
purposes
of
our
argument
we
can
assume
that
that
is
a
constitutional
requirement?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
the
disclaimer
ads
to
the
truth
of
the
statement?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
it
add
to
the
truth
of
the
statement?
i
mean,
it's
surely
true
that
if
you
had
somebody
saying,
this
was
one
pleased
client,
of
course
this
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
you'll
be
pleased
or
that
all
clients
are
always
pleased,
that
ads
to
the
truth
of
it,
doesn't
it?
i
should
think
your
argument
is
that
you
have
no
right
to
require
somebody
to
add
to
the
truth.
isn't
that
your
basic
argument,
that
you
can't
require
somebody
to
put
in
something
he
doesn't
want
to
say?
unknown
speaker
that
the
first
amendment
prevents
making
somebody
say
something,
as
well
as
preventing
somebody
from
saying
something?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
i
hope
before
you're
through
you
will
tell
us
why
you
haven't
stipulated
your
case
away.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
client
stipulated
to
take
whatever
discipline
his
partner
got.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
might
have
been
implicit
you
stipulate
to
the
same
discipline,
provided
it
could
be
legally
imposed.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
challenge
the
action
below
on
the
ground
that
it
exceeded
the
stipulation,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
not
that
the
stipulation
was
exceeded.
unknown
speaker
you
see,
you
put
us
in
the
position
of
stipulating
that
you'll
follow
the
other
case,
and
then
the
other
case
is
one
in
which
these
issues
are
not
raised
and
it's
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
but
essentially,
you
stipulated
on
the
merits
that
you'd
be
bound
by
the
first
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
you
understand
the
stipulations
then,
if
the
discipline
had
been
the
same
you
would
still
have
been
entitled
to
bring
an
argument
on
the
merits
here?
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
place
in
the
record,
to
which
perhaps
you
were
going,
where
we
can
actually
see
what
was
stipulated
to?
unknown
speaker
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
okay.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
to
me,
mr.
cohen...
you
know,
usually
a
stipulation,
in
fact
usually
any
contract,
there's
something
in
it
for
both
sides.
and
what
you're
saying,
you've
told
us
what
was
in
it
for
your
client.
that
is,
your
client
couldn't
get
any
sentence
higher
than
the
one
given
to
the
other
attorney.
unknown
speaker
what
was
quid
for
that
quo?
or
they
just
gave
you
that?
unknown
speaker
if
that
was
the
case,
then
he
simply
wouldn't
have
litigated
the
second
one.
but
a
stipulation
usually
means
you
have
agreed
to
one
thing
in
exchange
for
the
other
party
agreeing
to
something
else.
i
read
the
stipulation
to
mean
that
you
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
factual
determination,
in
exchange
for
which
they
promised,
won't
give
you
any
higher
sentence.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
i
misspoke.
what
were
the
facts
in
dispute
that
you
were
stipulating
to?
unknown
speaker
so
in
fact,
the
other
side
got
nothing
from
this
stipulation?
just
out
of
the
goodness
of
their
heart,
they
promised
that
your
client
wouldn't
get
any
higher?
that
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
it
seems
to
me
you
were--
unknown
speaker
--exactly.
unknown
speaker
so
the
stipulation
makes
no
sense
to
me
unless
you
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
outcome
of
the
earlier
case,
not
just
factual.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
whatever
the
stipulation
meant,
it
disappeared
once
the
hearing
panel
found
no
culpability.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
wasn't
just
a
stipulation
of
facts.
it
was
a
stipulation
as
to
recommended
discipline.
unknown
speaker
there's
another
thing
that
puzzled
me
about
this.
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me,
but
i
thought
the
hearing
panel
at
some
stage
of
the
case,
they'd
advised
your
client
that
the
case
was
over
and
that
they
would
just
stipulate
to
dismiss
it,
and
your
client
insisted,
or
maybe
it
was
his
partner,
that
the
matter
be
reviewed
at
a
higher
level.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
who
initiated
that
request
after
20
months?
unknown
speaker
mr.
grey
is
the
partner
of
your
client?
unknown
speaker
so
he
was
the
one
that
was
not
satisfied
with
the
victory.
he
was
a
total
victor
at
that
point.
unknown
speaker
he
kind
of
wanted
a
declaratory
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
binding
in
the
sense,
as
i
understand
you,
that's
what
terminated
the
stipulation,
the
fact
that
he
prevailed
at
that
hearing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
do
you
agree
that
it
is
possible
under
the
first
amendment
for
the
state
bar
to
prohibit
advertising
that
it
believes
is
misleading?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
a
testimonial
which
focuses,
of
course,
as
it
did
here,
only
on
one
client's
experience,
without
explaining
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action
or
the
fact
that
it
was
just
her
individual
experience
under
a
bad
faith
claim...
it
wasn't
even
explained
that
it
was
a
bad
faith
claim,
apparently...
was
somehow
misleading--
unknown
speaker
--to
the
average
listener?
unknown
speaker
but
the
ad
didn't
further
explain.
the
testimonial
did
not
explain
the
nature
of
the
claim
for
which
relief
was
obtained
or
the
circumstances,
just
a
broad
statement
that,
i
got
relief
and
i'm
happy.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
impression
is
that
it
may
have
been
quite
misleading
in
not
explaining
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action
and
the
relief.
and
i
wonder
whether
the
first
amendment
doesn't
permit
a
state
bar
to
just
prohibit
testimonials
in
general.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
attorneys
occupy
any
special
role
in
the
professions
and
in
the
hierarchy,
and
so
that
we
ought
to
be
a
little
more
concerned--
unknown
speaker
--about
their
advertising?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
a
finding
here
that
this
advertisement
was
misleading?
unknown
speaker
was
there
some
indication
that
it
was
not?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
there
was
no
finding
that
it
was
misleading
or
that
anybody
else
thought
it
was?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
excuse
me.
there
was
no
finding
that
anything
special
about
this
testimonial
made
it
deceptive.
but
isn't
there
inherent
in
the
state
bar
decision
that
all
testimonials
are
deceptive?
that
was
the
basis
of
their
decision,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
they
effectively
find
that
this
is
deceptive
because
it's
a
testimonial.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
so
it's
no
more
deceptive
than
all
testimonials.
but
they
have
found
this,
being
a
testimonial,
is
deceptive.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
sort
of
the
issue,
isn't
it,
whether
testimonials
are
deceptive?
unknown
speaker
but
that
finding,
if
that's
the
basis
for
their
rule,
it's
also
a
finding
that
there
can't
be
any
testimonial
that
is
not
misleading.
unknown
speaker
as
part
of
your
answer,
i
believe,
to
justice
o'connor,
i
thought
you
had
indicated
that
there
was
no
recommendation
here
that
this
firm
be
retained.
is
that
what
you
were
about
to
say?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
concludes
by
saying:
"if
i
had
any
legal
problem,
car
accident
or
anything,
i
would
definitely
go
back
to
greg
&
oring.
"
"i
certainly
do
believe
that.
"
and
they
give
the
phone
number
twice.
you
can't
really
tell
us
that
this
wasn't
intended
to
be
used
to
solicit
the
firm.
otherwise,
they
were
wasting
their
money.
unknown
speaker
didn't
this
rule
really
mean
that
anybody
who
is
using
a
testimonial
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
is
not
misleading?
unknown
speaker
and
wasn't
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
your
client
failed
to
prove
that
it
was
not
misleading?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say,
i
suppose,
that
shifting
the
burden
like
that
violates
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
that
i
may
have
missed
earlier.
under
the
rule
they
recently
adopted,
which
requires
a
disclaimer
in
this
kind
of
announcement,
what
exactly
does
the
disclaimer
have
to
say?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
there
are
two
written
stipulations--
unknown
speaker
--somewhere
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
that's
how
i
read
it,
too.
but
how
do
you
explain
the
colloquy
on
page
4,
the
statements
of
mr.
markle
on
page
4
that
mr.
cohen
brought
to
our
attention?
unknown
speaker
but
where
does
that
leave
us
in
terms
of
the
stipulation?
what
do
we
have
before
us
now?
unknown
speaker
is
the
petitioner
out
of
court?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it's
a
permissible
reading
of
the
stipulation
that
he
would
simply
accept
the
discipline
imposed
by
the
state
bar,
cut
retain
leave
to
appeal
perhaps
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
or
at
least
to
this
court
if
he
thought
it
were
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
mr.
grey
i
take
it
could
have
appealed
to
this
court
had
he
so
chosen.
unknown
speaker
ms.
yu,
let
me
take
one
more
stab
at
it.
i
don't
want
to
prolong
this
thing
too
long,
but
it
is
sort
of
a
jurisdictional
problem.
that
statement
of
mr.
markle
on
page
4,
"in
the
event
that
this
hearing
panel
finds.
"
--this
is
the
problematic
one...
"this
hearing
panel
finds
that
there
is
no
culpability,
then
it's
the
parties'
understanding
that
the
stipulation
would
have
no
force
and
effect
whatever,
and
that
whatever
decision
the
hearing
panel
reaches,
that
decision
would
apply,
if
the
decision
included
a
finding
of
no
culpability,
that
decision
would
apply
to
both
mr.
oring
and
mr.
grey.
"
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
hearing
panel
finds
no
culpability?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
yu.
i
give
up.
did
you
say
a
while
ago
that
there
is
some
part
of
this
case
that
is
fairly
before
us
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
that
even
before
us?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
at
least
the
facial
validity
of
this
rule
is
before
us,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
really
don't
understand
that.
if
this
man
has
stipulated
to
the
discipline
and
the
ultimate
outcome
is
giving
the
discipline
regardless
of
what
we
decide
on
the
constitutionality,
it's
just
like
somebody
walking
in
off
the
street
and
saying,
i'd
like
to
have
you
rule
on
the
facial
validity
of
this
rule.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
classic
case
of
no
case
or
controversy.
unknown
speaker
are
you
standing
on
the
stipulation?
you're
not
waiving
the
stipulation?
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
the
position
that
all
testimonial
ads
are
inherently
misleading?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
if
it
didn't?
what
if
it
just
said,
what
if
the
testimonial
merely
said
that
they
have
a
very
fine-looking
office
and
a
polite
receptionist
who
answers
the
telephone
courteously
and
you
will
receive
courteous
treatment
if
you
come
into
our
office,
and
everybody
who
ever
went
to
the
office
qualified
that
way?
what
would
be
misleading
about
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
would
be
a
violation
of
your
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
the
presumption
irrational
as
applied
to
that
kind
of
a
testimonial?
unknown
speaker
even
the
ad
i
described?
unknown
speaker
even
the
ad
i
described?
unknown
speaker
it
gives
very
limited
information,
but
everything
it
says
is
easily
verifiable,
100
percent
true,
and
experienced
by
every
client
or
potential
client
who
ever
went
into
that
office.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
does
it
misrepresent?
it
said
the
insurance
company
was
giving
her
a
hard
time,
was
harassing
her,
bills
were
piling
up.
that's
the
elements
of
bad
faith.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
words
"tort"
and
"contributory
negligence"
aren't
used,
either,
because
those
put
people
to
sleep.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
if
you
want
to
publish
any
testimonial
you
have
to
get
consent
in
advance.
unknown
speaker
so
you
just
have
to
take
your
risk?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
way,
there's
no
way
for
him
to
get
permission
in
advance,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if,
instead
of
this
being
a
testimonial
ad
by
some
client,
the
lawyer
himself
says,
i
had
this
case
where
there
was
this,
one
of
my
clients
had
this
kind
of
an
experience?
he
just
said
the
same
thing
on
his
own
behalf.
would
you
still
be
making
this
kind
of
an
argument,
that
it
was
misleading?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
a
state
bar
rule
that
says
that
every
ad
like
this,
where
it's
the
lawyer
himself
saying
what
happened,
is
misleading,
would
that
be
constitutional,
the
lawyer
advertising?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
the
american
bar
did,
but
how
about
the
constitutionality?
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
be
arguing
it
as
an
as-applied
challenge.
i
thought
you
said
all
that
was
before
us
was
the
facial
challenge.
unknown
speaker
but
why
in
dealing
with
the
presumption
would
we
distinguish
between
an
as-applied
challenge
and
a
facial
challenge?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
see
the
stipulation
as
distinguishing
between
as-applied
and
facial--
unknown
speaker
--why?
unknown
speaker
but
why
should
he
have
any
more
opportunity
to
bring
a
facial
challenge
before
us
on
the
merits
than
an
as-applied
challenge?
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
a
minute
ago
told
us
we
didn't
have
anything.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
amended
rule
that
now
requires
a
disclaimer.
is
it
your
understanding
that
that
was
adopted
in
more
or
less
a
contingent
fashion,
depending
on
the
outcome
of
this
case?
or
is
that
part
of
the
rule
no
matter
what
we
do?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
so
that
are
there
a
whole
backlog
of
discipline
cases
that
are
backed
up
awaiting
the
outcome
of
this
case,
or
is
this
the
only
one
that
really
is
pending
under
the
old
rule?
unknown
speaker
see,
what
seems
to
me
is
we
may
be
deciding
the
facial
validity
of
a
rule
that
doesn't
apply
to
anybody
except
for
the
litigant
here,
who
has
no
interest
in
the
outcome
because
he
stipulated
the
case
away.
unknown
speaker
it's
really
a
big
case,
in
other
words.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
stipulation
said
the
supreme
court
of
california
can
increase
the
discipline.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
why
you
can't.
i
don't
know
why
you
can't
agree
you'll
be
bound
by
somebody
else's
outcome.
it
happens
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
if
we
rule
the
way
you
want,
what
benefit
will
that
be
to
the
law
in
california,
the
united
states,
or
anyplace
else?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
speak
too
well
of
the
bar.
unknown
speaker
will
this
case
stop
that?
unknown
speaker
if
we
rule
with
you
on
this
case,
will
that
stop
what
they're
doing
now?
unknown
speaker
will
this
decision
in
this
case
benefit
anybody
but
your
client?
unknown
speaker
how?
unknown
speaker
what
in
particular
would
it
do?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
would
deal
with
the
procedure
in
california?
unknown
speaker
which
doesn't
interest
us
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
you
feel
that
you
have
been
aggrieved
and
you
just
want
to
have
something
done
about
it.
unknown
speaker
and
i
just
don't
know
what
you
want.
unknown
speaker
is
