ms.
diane
c.
yu
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
may
please
the
court:
before
i
begin,
i'd
like
to
correct
or
clarify
a
few
of
the
comments
that
have
been
raised
in
the
context
of
this
last
discussion
with
my
opponent.
first
of
all,
the
federal
trade
commission,
contrary
to
what
he
indicates,
does
in
fact
have
a
special
standard
for
endorsements
and
testimonials.
their
regulations,
regulation
no.
255.1
and
255.2,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
do
clearly
indicate
that
they
understand
"that
an
advertisement
employing
an
endorsement
reflecting
the
experience
of
an
individual
or
a
group
of
consumers
on
a
central
or
key
attribute
of
the
product
or
service
will
be
interpreted
as
representing
that
the
endorser's
experience
is
representative
of
what
consumers
will
generally
achieve
with
the
advertised
product
in
actual,
albeit
variable,
conditions
of
use.
"
therefore,
unless--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--i'm
reading
from
the
federal
trade
commission
regulation
255.2,
which
indicates
they
state
that
the
advertiser,
unless
he
or
she
can
adequately
substantiate
these
representations,
should
either
clearly
and
conspicuously
disclose
what
the
generally
expected
performance
would
be
or
clearly
and
conspicuously
disclose
the
limited
applicability
of
the
endorser's
experience
to
what
consumers
may
generally
expect
to
achieve.
so
in
fact
the
federal
trade
commission
does
recognize
that
testimonials
and
endorsements
carry
with
them
special
risks
in
terms
of
misleading
or
deceiving
the
public,
and
the
answer
is
disclosure
and
disclaimer
in
order
to
solve
that
problem
and
eliminate
the
deception
or
misleading
content.
that
is
what
we
have
been
saying
all
along.
a
second
point
that
was
raised
were
the
stipulations,
and
i
can
certainly
understand
some
of
the
confusion.
we
contend
that
the
two
stipulations
should
be
read
in
context
with
the
colloquy
which
is
found
in
the
joint
appendix,
pages
4
to
6.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
that's
correct.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
they're
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
appendixes
d
and
e.
if
you
read
those
two
stipulations
together,
nowhere,
contrary
to
what
appellant
says,
does
it
say,
if
the
hearing
panel
finds
no
culpability,
mr.
oring
is
scot-free
or
he
is
off.
in
fact,
what
it
says,
it
understands
that
these
stipulations
are
subject
to
approval
by
the
review
department,
which
is
our
appellate
level
in
the
state
bar
court,
and
also
the
california
supreme
court.
moreover,
in
the
discussion
before
the
hearing
panel,
which
mr.
cohen
himself
participated
in
and
in
fact
was
active
in
producing
the
stipulations
that
are
before
you,
he
states
in
page
5
of
the
joint
appendix:
"in
other
words,
our
intent
is
that
whatever
happens
to
mr.
grey
would
happen
to
mr.
oring.
"
and
he
later
goes
on
to
say
that
he
understands
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
discipline
might
be
increased,
because
he
says:
"for
example,
supposing,
which
this
doesn't
apply,
but
supposing
there
were
a
situation
where
it
was
a
stipulated
suspension
of
30
days.
"
"what
we're
saying
is
that
would
not
go
into
effect
with
respect
to
mr.
oring
any
sooner
than
it
would
go
into
effect
for
mr.
grey.
"
he
later
says:
"in
other
words,
we
will
leave
mr.
grey
and
his
able
counsel
to
litigate.
"
so
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
scalla,
what
the
state
bar
go
out
of
this,
we
thought,
was
that
he...
we
were
closing
the
case
against
mr.
oring,
and
we
were
going
to
let
mr.
grey
and
the
state
bar
litigate.
in
other
words,
mr.
grey
was
going
to
be
the
designated
litigator,
mr.
oring
would
take
a
back
seat,
and
when
discipline
was
officially
and
finally
imposed
against
mr.
grey,
if
any,
it
would
be
imposed
against
mr.
oring.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
it's
definitely
true
there
are
a
number
of
confusing
and
somewhat
irregular
items
in
this
particular
record.
that's
an
understatement,
i'm
sure.
with
respect
to
what
mr.
markle
is
stating,
he
understood
that
the
hearing
panel
was
going
to
rule
in
effect
on
the
constitutionality,
and
that
is
what
the
parties
believed
was
going
to
happen
in
the
grey
matter.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
intent,
notwithstanding
his
comments
about
the
culpability
aspect,
is
not
borne
out
at
all
by
the
stipulations
themselves,
but
that
the
comments
of
mr.
cohen,
who
drafted
the
stipulation
as
to
force
and
effect
of
the
first
stipulation...
it's
very
clear
that
he
understood
that
his
client
would,
if
disciplined
at
all,
would
not
receive
a
greater
discipline
than
mr.
grey,
and
that
he
was
backing
out.
they
were
leaving
the
case
to
mr.
grey
to
take
over.
so
that
is...
it
is
somewhat--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--well,
under
california
law--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--under
california
law,
our
position
is
that
the
stipulations
take
him
out
of
the
as-applied
category
and
that
all
he
has
is
a
facial
attack.
it
is
somewhat
unusual,
and
we
understand
that
the
california
supreme
court
in
denying
him
review
in
effect
has
upheld
the
decision
in
the
state
bar
and
is
holding
him
to
the
stipulations.
and
we
would
certainly
urge
this
court
not
to
free
him
from
his
obligations,
because
that
would
have
impact
far
greater
than
this
one
discipline
case,
if
parties
can
so
readily
back
out
of
agreements
they
make
and
other
parties
have
relied
upon
in
good
faith.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
that
was
not
our
understanding.
the
understanding
was
mr.
grey
was
going
to
take
the
ball
and
run
with
it.
mr.
grey
did.
he
lost.
the
discipline
was
imposed
against
him.
and
mr.
oring,
we
understood
and
thought,
was
also
going
to
accept
that.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
that's
correct.
he
did
file
and
certiorari
was
denied
as
to
his
case.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
right.
that
is
irregular,
because
mr.
markle
i
guess
we
should
say
should
have
understood...
everybody
understood,
although
it's
not
expressed
here,
that
the
hearing
panel
is
not
the
final
word
on
the
discipline
of
an
attorney.
it
goes
automatically
from
the
hearing
panel
to
the
review
department.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
that's
correct.
the
review
department
has
authority
to
review
the
matter
on
its
own,
which
in
fact
it
did.
and
in
this
case,
the
state
bar
did
apply
to
the
review
department
for
review.
and
the
decision
of
the
hearing
panel
was
overruled
there
and
the
decision
later
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
denying
review
upheld
the
review
department's
determination
that
there
was
culpability
and
there
ought
to
be
discipline
imposed.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
we
understand
as
before
us
would
be
the
constitutionality
of
the
presumption.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
well,
that
is
actually
a
question
we
have
wondered
about.
but
we've
briefed
it.
we
understand
that
there
is
some
concern
on
the
part
of
the
court
with
respect
to
lawyer
advertising
and
where
it's
going.
in
fact,
we
welcome
this
opportunity
to
urge
the
court
to
draw
a
line.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
that
would
be
correct.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
as
i
said,
we
feel
he
doesn't
have
the
right
personally
to
benefit
from
whatever
ruling
might
come
from
this
court.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
well,
i
hesitated
to
raise
that,
but
we
did
have
some
concern
about
how
this
case
and
why
this
case
is
here.
but
as
i
said,
we
are
prepared
to
answer
any
questions
that
you
have
about
it.
i
did
want
to
also--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--no,
we're
not
waiving
the
stipulation,
and
we
certainly
are
not
conceding
any
of
the
factual
points
that
he
raised,
including
the
fact
that
we
think
this
testimonial
is
misleading
and
deceptive,
as
all
testimonials
are,
although
the
state
of
california
does
have
a
provision
that,
if
you
can
show
the
testimonial
is
not
deceptive
and
misleading,
that
the
attorney
may
run
it.
we
think
that's
a
fair
balance
between
the
competing
interests
at
stake.
we
think
it's
a
reasonable
and
constitutional
way
to
get
at
the
very
serious
problem
of
deceptive
and
misleading
advertising
in
the
lawyer
context.
there
was
another
point
i
believe
justice
scalla
raised
with
respect
to
whether
the
state
bar
could
require
an
attorney
to
present
more
information
than
he
or
she
might
be
inclined
to
do.
and
i
would
understand
that
the
ruling
from
the
zauderer
case
would
suggest
that
in
some
instances
even
truthful
statements
may
carry
with
them
inherently
deceptive
or
misleading
impressions
or
connotations
with
them,
such
that
the
state
may
permissibly
require
them
to
disclose
more
than
they
might
initially
be
inclined
to
state.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
yes.
we
also
believe
that
the
reasons
for
that
are
well-known
and
sound.
they
have
four
components
that
make
them
inherently
misleading
and
deceptive.
they
constitute
claims
as
to
quality,
which
this
court
in
bates
has
indicated
is
not
protected...
is
not
something
that
can
be
verified
or
measured
in
any
real
way.
they
also
constitute
promises
or
inferences
that
certain
results
will
obtain,
and
that's
what
the
ftc
regulations
are
aiming
at.
this
particular
ad
also
contains
material
omissions
of
fact,
half-truths,
in
it,
were
such
that
you
have
a
truthful
statement
which
is
nonetheless--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--those
sorts
of
client
satisfaction
testimonials
would
be
unlikely
to
produce
the
kind
of
investigation
that
this
one
did.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
but
we
have
the
presumption
that
says
an
attorney
may
show
that
those
statements
are
in
fact
not
just
true,
but
also
not
deceptive
or
misleading.
in
that
case,
if
he
could
meet
his
burden
fairly
readily,
he
would
be
allowed
to
run
that
type
of
advertisement,
because
those
are
the
kinds
of
things--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--no,
we
feel
that
the
form
of
advertising
itself
carries
with
it
such
inherent
capabilities
for
abuse
that--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--pardon
me?
ms.
diane
c.
yu
well--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--my
response
would
be
simply
that
the
form
of
advertising
itself
is
what
is
dangerous,
because
it
has
an
emotional
appeal
and
it
is
not
relying
on
the
content
of
the
message,
but
the
credibility
of
the
speaker.
so
i
think
we
would
say
the
presumption
would
fairly
operate
there.
but
we
also
would
concede
in
that
particular
case,
where
the
client
is
testifying
as
to
things
he
or
she
can
observe
and
can
in
fact
be
verified,
that
we
don't
have
the
same
problem
we
do
here,
where
the
testimonial
misrepresents
entirely
the
basis
of
a
cause
of
action
for
bad
faith.
we
find
it
quite
amazing
that--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--not
entirely.
we
find
it
quite
amazing
that
he
does
say
he's
trying
to
educate
the
public,
because
never
once
in
the
ad
are
the
words
"bad
faith",
"insurance
bad
faith
claim",
"breach
of
covenant
of
good
faith--
"
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--well,
in
this
particular
instance
mere
harassment
or
not
liking
the
way
your
insurance
company
treats
you
may
not
at
all
form
the
basis
for
a
bad
faith
claim.
what
is
misleading
here
in
addition
to
the
failure
to
mention
those
items
is
the
fact
that
the
double
recovery
doesn't
come
from
the
auto
accident,
even
though
that
keeps
being
stressed,
as,
if
i
have
a
problem
with
an
auto
accident,
if
you
have
an
auto
accident
you
need
a
lawyer.
the
clear
intent
of
this
particular
testimonial
is
to
imply
that
from
a
simple
fender-bender
you
may
get
a
double
recovery
if
you
don't
happen
or
your
lawyer,
this
lawyer,
doesn't
happen
to
like
your
insurance
company.
and
that
simply
is
not
true.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
well,
we
don't
have
a
procedure
for
pre-screening,
if
that's
what
you--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--that's
correct
in
some
respect,
although
we
think
in
this
case
that
is
an
important
point
to
make,
because
here
he
seems
to
make
a
virtue
of
the
fact--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--we
don't
currently
have
the
resources
to
do
that.
with
120,000
lawyers,
it's
somewhat
difficult.
but
we
do
have,
as
i
was
going
to
say,
we
do
have
here
the
representation
that
it
is
somehow
a
virtue
that
he
didn't--
ms.
diane
c.
yu
--well,
it
certainly
could
be,
because
it
could
still
be
truthful
and
yet
deceptive.
i
could
tell
you
in
all
candor,
i
have
never
lost
a
drunk
driving
case.
but
if
the
facts
were
i
had
only
tried
one
and
fortunately
won,
it
would
be
true,
but
it
would
be
very
misleading.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
it's
not
entirely
before
you.
i
would
imagine
that
it
may
have
some
of
the
same
problems.
in
fact,
the
american
bar
association
condemns
most
of
these
self-laudatory
ads,
whether
the
lawyer
said
it
or
whether
the
client
is
saying
it.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
if
it
has
the
same
elements
of
deceit
and
misleading
information
in
it,
it
would
still
violate
our
rule.
so
i
would
say
that
we
would
believe
it
would
be
constitutional
to
regulate
that
type
of
speech.
it
is
important
that
in
this
particular
case
the
appellant
says
almost
as
a
virtue
that
he
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
writing
of
this
ad,
that
it
was
his
client's
statements.
well,
that
belies
his
contention
that
he
was
trying
to
educate
the
public.
if
he
were
trying
to
educate
the
public
about
the
nature
of
bad
faith
claims,
he
wouldn't
have
a
lay
person
try
to
explain
what
had
happened
to
her.
that
simply
doesn't
make
sense.
in
other
words,
he
abdicated
his
role
as
a
professional
to
try
to
ensure
that
the
information
that
got
out
to
the
public
was
truthful
and
not
deceptive.
we
feel
that
this
particular
advertisement
by
itself
is
misleading
under
any
context,
and
that
it
is
inherently
misleading
because
of
these
results
that
are
being
promised,
the
misrepresentations
as
to
information
about
the
basis
of
the
cause
of
action,
the
quality
claim
that
she's
not
in
a
position
to
judge
and
cannot
be
measured.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
we
are
prepared
to
argue
on
all
of
these
bases.
we
do
feel,
though,
that
the
stipulation
takes
him
out.
but
should
the
court
be
entertaining
a
view
that
it
may
wish
to
look
at
the
presumption
and
its
validity,
we
felt
that
we
had
to
prepare
for
any
questions
that
you
had.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
well,
it
would
be
entirely
with
respect
to
the
facts
that
he
claims
or
the
situation
that
applies
to
him
in
terms
of
any
relief
he
may
get.
i
mean,
if
the
statute,
which
we
believe
ought
to
be
accorded
proper
deference,
is
in
fact
constitutional,
then
he
obviously
has
no
recourse
or
relief.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
yes.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
because
he
himself,
he
and
the
state
bar
have
already
negotiated
and
settled
whatever
their
agreements
and
understandings
were
about
how
his
case
was
going
to
be
handled.
we
feel
that
he
doesn't
now
have
the
opportunity
to
bring
it
before
you
on
the
merits.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
because
of
some
of
the
unusual
aspects
of
the
case,
which
the
record
may
reflect
in
terms
of
the
challenge
he
brought
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
then
coming
here
on
appeal,
it
does
create
a
somewhat
irregular
context
for
the
case.
but
we
were
prepared,
as
i
said,
to
deal
with
it.
as
we
said,
we
feel
that
this
presumption
is
a
reasonable
accommodation
between
the
competing
interests
that
the
court
has
indicated,
the
need
for
the
public
to
get
appropriate,
informative
information...
this
advertisement
does
not
give
that
type
of
informed
information.
it
has
half-truths
in
it,
it
has
omissions,
and
therefore
it
has
a
misleading
impression
for
the
public,
who
is
not
going
to
understand
the
difference
between
a
bad
faith
claim
and
how
that
could
produce
a
recovery,
let
alone
a
double
recovery,
and
a
simple
car
accident
claim.
we
also
feel
that
the
advertisement
by
itself
standing
alone,
with
or
without
the
presumption,
is
misleading
and
ought
to
have
been
regulated.
and
we
feel
that
certainly
the
stipulation
should
take
him
out
of
this
case
altogether.
finally,
we
would
like
to
make
an
argument
that
the
professionalism
and
public
needs
of
the
community
do
demand
that
a
strong
stand
be
made
with
respect
to
the
types
of
forms
of
advertising,
such
as
this
testimonial,
which
have
inherently
misleading
and
deceptive
qualities
to
them.
this
is
a
time
when
the
public
is
demanding
more
and
not
less
truth
and
candor,
more
and
not
less
ethical
behavior
on
the
part
of
lawyers.
with
120,000
lawyers
in
california
and
a
very
serious
discipline
problem,
we
take
our
job,
we
take
it
very
seriously.
and
we
do
hope
that
the
ruling
that
comes
from
this
court
will
speak
out
in
favor
of
allowing
misleading
and
deceptive
advertising
in
the
form
of
testimonials
to
be
regulated
in
a
reasonable
way.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
well,
as
i
said,
this
is
an
unusual
case,
and
the
situation
as
to
how
it
got
here
is
quite
exceptional.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
it
has
been
adopted
by
the
california
supreme
court.
it
would
be
operative
on
may
27th
of
1989.
obviously,
a
ruling
from
this
court
that
had
a
direct
bearing
on
it
would
cause
us
to
revisit
it.
but
it
will
otherwise
go
into
effect.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
we
don't
have
a
real
specific
count
on
the
number
of
testimonial
cases.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
right.
that
in
fact
has
occurred
to
us.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
right,
a
very
weighty
case.
well,
that
has
occurred
to
us.
in
fact,
this
new
rule
doesn't
even
help
the
appellant,
because
he
didn't
have
a
disclaimer
of
any
kind.
ms.
diane
c.
yu
in
short,
i
appreciate
your
attention
and
thank
you.
