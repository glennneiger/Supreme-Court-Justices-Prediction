mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mark
oring,
a
lawyer,
was
disciplined
by
the
state
bar
of
california
for
presenting
a
testimonial
radio
communication
which
was
never
found
to
be
false,
misleading,
or
deceptive.
in
fact,
the
state
bar
of
california
stipulated
that
the
advertisement
was
true.
the
basis
for
the
discipline
was
a
presumption
that
testimonial
advertisement
is
presumed
to
be
false,
misleading,
or
deceptive.
under
this
court's
prior
decisions,
such
a
presumption
placing
the
burden
on
the
speaker
to
prove
the
protected
nature
of
the
speech,
thus
effectively
banning
any
testimonial
advertisement,
is
unconstitutional.
the
constitutional
ground
rules
governing
this
area
we
believe
to
be
crystal
clear.
again
last
term
in
shapero
versus
kentucky
bar,
this
court
reiterated
the
well-established
standard
that
state
rules
designed
to
prevent
the
potential
for
deception
and
confusion
may
be
no
broader
than
reasonably
necessary
to
prevent
the
perceived
evil.
we
feel
that
the
state
bar
itself
has
recognized
that
its
legitimate
goal
of
preventing
deceptive
advertising
can
in
fact
be
met
by
a
less
stringent
and
restrictive
rule.
to
bring
the
case
up
to
date,
in
november,
or
on
november
28th
of
1988,
the
california
supreme
court
adopted
the
state
bar's
proposed
rule,
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs
and
in
our
appendix.
so
the
california
supreme
court
has
now
formally
adopted
the
state
bar's
proposed
rule
which
removes
that
presumption
so
long
as
the
advertisement
or
testimonial
advertisement
contains
a
disclaimer
which
states
that
it
is
not
a
guarantee
or
prediction
regarding
the
outcome
of
the
potential
client's
case.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
i
would
say
that
i
think
that
it
at
least
meets
the
objections
or,
not
objections
rather,
but
at
least
meets
the
standards
that
i
think
this
court
suggested
in
bates
and
in
r.m.j.--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
i
don't
say
at
this
point
that
i
think
even
requiring
a
disclaimer
would
be
constitutional
because
i
don't
know
that
testimonial
advertisements
should
be
treated
any
differently
than
advertisements
in
general.
apparently
the
federal
trade
commission
doesn't
feel
that
they
have
to
be
treated
any
differently,
and
they
feel
sufficiently
secure
that
they
can
test
each
ad
on
its
own
merits.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
i
don't.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
has
been
a
law
review
article,
i
believe
in
the
buffalo
law
review...
i
hope
we've
set
it
forth
in
our
brief...
by
professor
devine
indicating
that
disclaimers
may
tend
to
be
more
confusing.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
justice.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes,
if
i
may
address
that,
your
honor.
i
think
very
clearly...
and
we've
set
these
forth
in
both
our
opening
and
reply
briefs...
the
agreement
initially
made
with
the
state
bar
was
for
an
admonition.
that
is
what
we
stipulated
to,
an
admonition.
what
the
state
bar
imposed
upon
mr.
oring
was
a
public
reproval.
now,
a
public
reproval
is
a
more--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--he
agreed
to
take
whatever
discipline.
and
i
think
that
was
really
a
word
of
art
that
we
used
during
the
state
bar
hearings
to
indicate
a
lid
on
what
should
happen
to
mr.
oring.
the
intention
of
everyone...
and
i
would
like
to
quote
if
i
may
from
the
actual
reporter's
transcript
here,
where
i
think
mr.
markle,
who
represented
the
state
bar,
himself
clearly
understood
that,
in
the
event
that
the
entire
stipulation
were
not
accepted,
that
it
would
be
of
no
force
or
effect.
but
i
think
that
we
placed
a
cap
on
the
discipline
so
that
mr.
oring's
and
mr.
grey's
case
could
be
litigated.
and
since
they
had
been
partners
and
since
it
was
just
a
single
advertisement
that
had
been
run
by
both
of
them,
we
didn't
want
one
body
or
one
group
of
referees
to
perhaps
impose
one
form
of
discipline
on
mr.
grey
and
then
a
different
form
of
discipline
on
mr.
oring.
so
i
think
it
was
everyone's
intent
that
both
should
receive
the
same
discipline.
however,
the
discipline
that
was
stipulated
to
was
an
admonition,
and
our
opening
brief
is
wrong
insofar
as
it
sets
forth
that
we
stipulated
to
a
public
reproval,
because
we
did
not
stipulate
to
a
public
reproval.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes,
we
certainly
did
not
stipulate
that
discipline
which
was
not
imposed
according
to
constitutional
standards
should
just
be
non-appealable
and
non-reviewable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
bar
in
its
letter
of
reprimand
to
mr.
oring
not
only
enclosed
a
copy
of
the
rules
governing
appeals
to
the
supreme
court,
but
specifically
stated
that
this
may
be
appealed
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
we
challenged
the
action
below...
that
is
in
the
petition
to
the
california
supreme
court?
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
we
challenged
the
action
below
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
raised
in
the
brief.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
was
raised
in
the
brief.
because
the
california
supreme
court--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--your
honor,
i
think
that
what
we
stipulated
to
was
that
no
greater
discipline
should
be
imposed
upon
mr.
oring
than
upon
mr.
grey,
because
mr.
oring,
having
left
the
case,
was
not
in
a
position
to
participate
in
the
grey
case,
and
we
wanted
to
receive
no
greater
discipline.
if
i
may,
i'll
go
to
the
record.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
no,
we
did
not.
we
stipulated
on
the
merits
that
we
would
be
bound
by
the
discipline,
degree
of
discipline
that
would
be
imposed.
but
a
stipulation
as
to
degree
of
discipline
or
as
to
facts
is
not
a
stipulation
that
we
do
not
have
rights
to
review.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes,
we
would
have
been
able
to
bring
an
argument
on
the
merits,
because
under
california
law
the
stipulation
as
to
facts,
as
to
facts
only--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
in
the
reporter's
transcript,
which
is...
it's
page
3,
i
believe.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
of
the
joint
appendix.
at
page
4,
by
mr.
markle,
if
i
may
quote:
"in
the
event
that
the
hearing
panel
makes
a
finding
of
culpability--
"
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--i'm
reading
from
on
page
4
of
the
joint
appendix.
it's
a
statement
by
mr.
markle,
representing
the
state
bar.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
"in
the
event
that
the
hearing
panel
makes
a
finding
of
culpability,
then
it's
the
position
of
the
parties,
in
particular
the
state
bar,
mr.
cohen,
and
mr.
oring,
that
the
stipulation
that
we
would
lodge
tonight
would
then
become
effective
as
the
parties'
stipulated
recommended
disposition,
which
obviously
the
hearing
panel
can
approve
or
disapprove.
"
and
then
he
goes
on.
"in
the
event
that
this
hearing
panel
finds
that
there
is
no
culpability,
then
it's
the
parties'
understanding
that
the
stipulation
would
have
no
force
and
effect
whatsoever.
"
now,
the
hearing
panel
found
no
culpability,
and
we
submit
that
therefore
that
stipulation
is
of
no
force
or
effect.
the
three-member
hearing
panel
found
that
there
was
no
culpability
because
the
presumption
was
unconstitutional.
and
therefore,
by
the
state
bar's
own
statement,
we
submit
that
that
stipulation
was
no
longer
of
any
force
or
effect.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
preliminary
hearing
referee
initially
who
first
heard
this
matter
dismissed
the
matter
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
i
can
say,
and
perhaps
i
may
be
going
outside
the
record,
mr.
oring
just
did
not
have
the
wherewithal
at
that
point
in
time
to
litigate
something
that
we
felt
would
be
litigated
by
mr.
grey.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
by
the
factual
determination,
your
honor,
not
by
the
legal
determination.
because
under
california
rules
as
i
understand
them
to
be,
a
stipulation
as
to
facts
and
discipline
is
always
reviewable
by
the
california
supreme
court.
we
cannot
stipulate
away
the
right
to
review,
because
mr.
oring
did
not
know
at
the
time
of
entering
into
this
stipulation
what
the
discipline
would
be.
you
see,
we
might
have
stipulated
to
nothing
higher
than
an
admonition.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
there
were
no
facts
in
dispute
whatsoever.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
it
was
the
same
radio
advertisement
that
was
involved,
and
really
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
added
to
the
case--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--by
having
two
parties
litigate
it.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
if
i
may,
justice
scalla,
the
stipulation
doesn't
say
that
at
all.
it
says
that
we
agree
to
be
bound
by
the
factual
determination
and
we
agreed
to
an
admonition.
now,
an
admonition
is
not
a
matter
of
record.
it
doesn't
blemish
the
lawyer's
record.
it
doesn't
prevent
him
from
perhaps
receiving
a
judicial
appointment
later
on.
whereas,
the
state
bar
ultimately
did
not
impose
this
admonition.
it
went
further
and
it
imposed
a
public
reproval,
which
is
a
blemish
on
mr.
oring's
record.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
that's
my
understanding,
because
that
was
even
mr.
markle's
statement
to
the
hearing
panel,
that
the
stipulation
was
going
to
be
of
no
force
or
effect
if
the
hearing
panel
found
no
culpability.
and
indeed,
the
hearing
panel
found
no
culpability.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
as
to
recommended
discipline,
which
was
not
followed
by
the
state
bar.
and
we
submit
that
therefore
on
that
ground
also--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--no,
i
don't
know
that
that
was
the
case,
justice
stevens.
initially
it
came
before
referee
craig,
who
dismissed
it
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
state
bar
did
nothing
for
about
20
months.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
and
then
mr.
grey
went
to
the
california
supreme
court,
and
the
court
ordered
that
the
bar
either
proceed
or
dismiss.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
mr.
grey.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes,
former
partner
of
mr.
oring.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
no.
he
was...
you
see,
the
sword
was
hanging
over
his
head
for
20
months.
he
didn't
know
whether
he
could
go
ahead
with
advertising
or
not
go
ahead
with
advertising,
apparently.
in
other
words,
the
case--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--it
was
still
lying
there
and,
yes,
he
wanted
to
know
whether
it
was
over
or
not;
and
apparently
not
being
able
to
get
any
definitive
word
on
that,
asked
the
california
supreme
court,
who
then
ordered
the
bar
to
either
proceed
or
dismiss.
see,
that
preliminary
hearing
determination
was
not
binding.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
bar
contended,
i
believe
in
the
grey
case--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--well,
no.
what
we
feel
terminated
the
stipulation
was
the
three-member
panel
which
found
no
culpability,
because
it
was
before
that
three-member
panel
that
mr.
markle
on
behalf
of
the
state
bar
stated
that
that
stipulation
would
be
of
no
force
or
effect
if
that
panel
found
no
culpability,
and
they
did
find
no
culpability.
we
feel
that
equally
offensive
to
the
first
amendment
principles
that
this
court
has
elaborated
in
cases
which
we
feel
are
analogous
to
this
one
is
the
presumption
under
the
regulation
that
communications
are
false,
misleading,
or
deceptive.
the
general
rule
from
speiser
versus
randall
and
friedman
versus
maryland,
under
those
cases
the
speaker
may
not
be
allocated
the
burden
of
proving
the
protected
nature
of
the
communication.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
that
it
believes
is
misleading.
i
think,
yes,
i
think
of
course
the
state
bar
has
an
obligation,
and
i
think
that
we
lawyers
expect
the
state
bar
to
prohibit
advertising
that
is
misleading.
indeed,
this
court--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--i
don't,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
if
i
may,
number
one,
i
don't
think
that
the
general
public
would...
i
think
it
would
be
more
misleading
to
use
the
word
"bad
faith"
in
an
ad
addressed
to
the
general
public.
we
lawyers
may
know
what
that
means,
but
i
don't
think
the
public
does.
i
think
that
what
this
ad
did,
and
i
think
why
an
ad
in
this
type
of
a
case
differs
from
a
general
advertisement,
is
that
the
advertisement
here
did
not
seek
retention
of
the
law
firm.
and
unlike
an
ad
for
the
sale
of
a
product,
it
didn't
ask
the
listener
or
viewer
to
go
to
the
store
and
buy
the
soap
or
makeup
without
further--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--no,
if
i
may,
justice
o'connor,
the
ad
said
specifically:
"i
was
rear-ended
on
the
san
diego
freeway
and
my
medical
bills
were
piling
up.
"
so
it
did,
i
believe,
state
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action
and
what
had
happened
to
this
individual.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
in
general?
we
feel
that
the
federal
trade
commission...
and
we've
cited
those
matters
in
our
brief...
the
federal
trade
commission
doesn't
feel
that
testimonials
ought
to
be
treated
any
differently
than
any
other
form
of
advertising.
we
believe
that
the
public
is
not--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--i
think
so.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes,
and
i
think
lawyers
have
always
been
regulated
perhaps
a
little
more
strictly
than
the
other
businesses
or
trades.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
never,
sir.
there
was
never
a
finding
anywhere
in
this
case
that
the
ad
was
misleading,
false,
or
deceptive.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
i
believe
that
a
stipulation
that
the
ad
was
truthful
would
at
least
lend
some
inference
to
the
belief
that
it
was
not
false
or
misleading.
i
think
that
once
an
advertisement
has
been
shown
to
be
truthful,
what
more
could
the
lawyer
establish?
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
at
no
time,
and
it
did
not
arise
out
of
a
complaint
by
any
consumer.
this
was
a
state
bar-initiated
complaint.
i
feel
also
that
what
this--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--the
basis
for
creating
the
presumption
was
the
belief
that
all
testimonials
were
inherently
misleading.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
they
have
found
all
testimonials.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
i
may
say
that
that
finding...
there
has
been
absolutely
no
basis
shown
for
that
finding.
it
was
in
our
opinion
just
a
bald
conclusion,
not
based
upon
any
evidence
at
all.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes,
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes.
well,
if
i
may
say
it
this
way,
what
the
ad
said
is
that
there
is
no
fee
for
a
consultation.
so
i
think
that
we
have
to
take
the
conduct--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--well,
of
course
it
was
meant
to
solicit
the
firm,
surely,
surely,
justice
kennedy.
i
think--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
that
is
correct,
justice.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
that
is
our
position,
justice,
that
it
ought
to
be
the
one
who
seeks
to
regulate
the
speech
to
have
the
burden
of
proof.
i
think
that
when
the
client
or
potential
client
is
advised
that
they
may
come
in
for
a
free
consultation,
i
think
that
it
is
at
that
point
that
the
lawyer
has
the
obligation
to
answer
any
questions,
to
explain
the
law
fully.
and
it
is
at
that
point
when
time
can
be
taken
to
go
into
the
facts
of
the
case
and
go
into
the
law
of
the
case.
i
don't
believe
that
any
type
of
an
advertisement
can
completely
tell
all
there
is
to
tell.
and
so
because
this
ad
did
not
solicit
retention
immediately...
when
i
say
it
did
not
ask
them
to
come
into
the
office
and
then
they
would
be
charged
for
the
consultation,
it
was
a
free
consultation.
and
i
think
at
that
point
the
client
could
ask
any
questions
that
they
wanted
to,
and
the
lawyer
i
think
was
obligated
as
a
lawyer
to
give
truthful
and
full
answers
and
supply
full
information.
i
think
if
following
that
the
lawyer
did
not
act
professionally,
then
he
or
she
should
be
subject
to
discipline,
but
not
by
the
mere
fact
of
the
ad
itself.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--the
new
rule,
it
says:
"a
communication
which
contains
testimonials
about
or
endorsements
of
a
member,
unless
such
communication
also
contains
an
express
disclaimer,
such
as,
quote,
this
testimonial
or
endorsement
does
not
constitute
a
guarantee,
warantee
or
prediction
regarding
the
outcome
of
your
legal
matter.
"
if
it
doesn't
contain
that,
it
is
presumed,
just
as
the
old
rule
presumed,
that
the
ad
is
false,
misleading,
and
deceptive.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
say
that
i
don't
take
credit
for
the
creation
of
that
stipulation
at
all.
i
think
it
occurred
before
ms.
yu
was
employed
by
the
state
bar
and
i
don't
take
credit
for
the
creation
of
that.
what
mr.
oring
bargained
for
was
an
admonition,
and
he
received
something
more
horrendous.
supposing
he
had
bargained
for
an
admonition
and
the
review
department
determined
to
disbar
him.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
exactly,
and
that
is
why
exactly
one
cannot...
we
claim
that
one
cannot
stipulate
away
the
right
to
review
before
we
even
know
what
is
going
to
happen.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
i
think
that
the
intent
of
everyone,
and
it's
evidenced
by
mr.
grey
than
was
imposed
on
mr.
oring.
that
was
at
least
the
intention
as
i
understood
it
to
be.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
what
it
would
say
is
that
the
state
bar
must
use
the
least
onerous
means.
this
court
has
said
that.
now,
i
think
that
the
claim
that
the
state
bar
makes
that
it
doesn't
have
the
resources
to
permit
pre-submission
of
this
ad
as
the
kentucky
bar
did
is
really
not
well-founded.
the
state
bar
of
california
to
my
understanding
is
spending
$35
million
for
discipline
this
year.
their
dues
i
believe
are
the
highest
in
the
country.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
argue
with
the
fact
that
they
need
to
do
those
things.
i
think
all
of
us
in
the
legal
profession
are
concerned
with
the
quality
of--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
i
hope
it
would.
i
hope
that
the
state
bar
of
california
would--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
of
course
i
don't
know
what
the
court
is
going
to
hold
or
what
dicta
may
be
in
the
court's
opinion.
but
i
think
that
any
decision
from
this
court,
of
course,
benefits
all
of
us
in
the
legal
profession
because
we
get
guidance
on
how
to
proceed,
and
i
think
that
the
state
bar
would
receive
guidance
from
this
court.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
in
this
case?
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
as
to
anyone
except
mr.
oring?
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
i
suppose
that
it
would
determine,
and
i
hope
it
might
determine,
whether
or
not
a
disclaimer
would
be
permissible,
or
whether
there
was
some
less
onerous
method
of
dealing
with
this
situation.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes,
or
whether
a
testimonial
may
be--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--i
would
say,
justice
marshall,
that
perhaps
the
decision
would
determine
whether
testimonials
might
be
treated
differently
than
any
other.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
that
is
the
reason
that
mr.
oring
is
here.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
i
think
what
happens
is
that
we
have
a
man
who
bargained
for
an
admonition
which
does
not
affect
his
record
publicly
and
he
received
something
which
now
is
a
blemish
upon
his
record.
i
think
that's
why
he
came
here,
of
course.
but
i
think
that
the
state
bar's
position
really
doesn't
meet
with
the
requirements
that
this
court
laid
down
in
its
previous
lawyer
advertising
cases,
to
use
the
least
heinous
means
available.
california
could
have
provided
for
pre-submission
of
this
ad.
i
don't
feel
that
a
lawyer
ought
to
risk
his
license
without
knowing
ahead
of
time
whether
what
he
is
doing
is
permissible.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
i
believe
it
is,
i
believe
it
is,
because,
they
had
to
run
the
ad.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
it's
not
lose
his
license,
but
he--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--yes,
but
your
honor,
under
the
presumption
as
it
existed
a
lawyer
could
risk
losing
his
license,
because
we
don't
know
what
discipline
would
be
imposed.
so
the
lawyer
must
risk
the
discipline
in
order
to
find
out
whether
the
ad
is
permissible
or
not.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
of
course
we
would
want
a
reversal
of
the
case,
your
honor,
and
a
determination--
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
--i
suppose
so,
your
honor,
if
you
choose
to.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
yes,
i
suppose
this
court
could
do
that.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
i
think
this
court
could
do
whatever
it
chooses
to
do,
your
honor.
[laughter]
we
would
feel
that
the
issue
before
the
court
is
not
a
question
of
whether
the
state
can
prohibit
or
punish
false
and
misleading
advertisements
by
lawyers.
of
course
it
can.
but
we
feel
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
state
can
relieve
itself
of
the
burden
of
showing
that
an
ad
is
constitutionally
protected,
by
enacting
a
presumption,
as
it
did
here,
that
all
testimonials
are
presumed
to
be
false
and
misleading
and
thereby
making
the
person
exercising
the
right
of
free
speech
to
bear
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
speech
is
in
fact
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
well,
i
believe
the
speiser
versus
randall
case
indicates
that,
your
honor,
and
the
friedman
case.
mr.
theodore
a.
cohen
those
are
some
of
them,
your
honor.
