mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
applicable
to
both
of
the
cases
before
court
today,
and
then
turn
to
the
caplin
&
drysdale
case.
first,
it
is
important
i
think
to
point
out
the
procedural
posture
that
these
two
cases
present.
there
are
two
basic
issues
that
have
been
litigated
in
the
so-called
attorneys'
fee
forfeiture
cases.
one
is
the
substantive
question,
which
is
the
question
that
is
presented
in
these
cases,
of
whether
funds
that
a
defendant
wishes
to
use
to
pay
an
attorney
may
be
forfeited
at
all,
consistent
with
the
statute
and
the
sixth
amendment,
and
the
second
is
a
procedural
question
which
is
not
presented
in
this...
these
cases,
but
has
come
up
in
other
cases,
involving
what
kind
of
procedures
the
courts
must
go
through,
if
any,
to
establish
the
right
to
a
forfeiture,
that
is
to
say,
should...
must
there
be
a
pretrial
hearing
of
some
sort
and
what
must
that
hearing
consist
in.
now,
the
reason,
of
course,
that
these
two
cases
don't
present
the
procedural
point
is
simply
that
in
the
caplin
&
drysdale
case,
there
was
a
guilty
plea
simultaneously
with
the
motion
to
modify
the
restraining
order
and,
therefore,
we
know
as
of
the
time
that
the
restraining
order
modification
motion
was
filed,
that
the
defendant
was,
in
fact,
guilty
of
the
crimes
and
that
he,
in
fact,
was
subject
to
the
forfeiture
provisions
with
respect
to
all
of
the
property
that
he
conceded
was
forfeitable.
and
in
the
monsanto
case,
the
court
of
appeals
panel
required
and
the
district
court
held
a
pretrial
hearing
long
before
any
counsel
had
to
prepare
for
the
trial
in
which
it
was
determined,
as
the
district
court
found,
by
overwhelming
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
committed
the
crimes
and
that
the
property
was
forfeitable.
so...
so,
these
cases
present
the
substantive
question
in
a
very
stark
posture.
they
present
the
question
whether...
that
if
we
know
to
either
a
certainty
or
by
overwhelming
likelihood
that
the
fees
are...
excuse
me...
that
the...
the
property
in
issue
is
subject
to
forfeiture,
must
that
property
nonetheless
be
excluded
from
a
forfeiture
order.
and
our
position
on
that
is
that
neither
statute
nor
the
sixth
amendment
requires
that
result.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the...
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
issue
with
respect...
a
general
fifth
amendment
claim
that
is
made
by
caplin
&
drysdale
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment
to
put
this
kind
of
authority
in
the
hands
of
prosecutors.
it's
related
to
the
sixth
amendment
question.
the
procedural
due
process
question--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
believe
is
not
presented
in
these
cases.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
a
hearing.
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
and,
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
in
caplin
&
dryscales
en
banc
court,
made
exactly
that
point
and
pointed
out
that
in
light
of
the
posture
of
this
case,
we
are
really
presented
only
with
the...
the
flat,
substantive
question
of
whether
forfeiture
is
possible
without
regard
to
the
strength
of
the
government's
case.
in
other
words,
this
is,
in
essence,
the
case
that
i
think
justice
stevens
put
in
which
we
know...
because
the
bills
are
marked,
we
know
that
this
money
belongs
to
the
government.
in
this
case
we
know
that
the
money
belongs
to
the
government
not
because
the
bills
are
marked,
which
gives
us
a
very
high
degree
certitude,
but
because
the
defendant
admitted
that
he
was
guilty
and
that
the
money
was
forfeitable,
which
gives
us
a
complete
degree
of
certitude,
as
much
as
the
law--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--when
we
had
it,
your
honor,
was...
and
let
me
give
you
the
chronologies
because
i
think
it
may
be
important.
there
was
an
indictment
in
january,
and
six
weeks
passed
and
then
on
march
7th,
the
defendant
made
a
motion
to
vacate
or
modify
the
restraining
order
in
order
to
provide
for
the
payment
of
attorneys'
fees.
that
was
the
first
time
the
court
or
the
government
heard
anything
from
the
defendant
about
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
attorneys'
fees--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
and...
and
the...
in
order
to
trigger
any
right
to
a
contrary
result,
the
defendant
has
to
make
some
kind
of
motion,
tell
the
court
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
regime.
the
first
time
that
happened--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
if
the
landlord
is
on
notice.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
the
landlord
is
not
in
a
position
to
be
a
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value
because
he
is
on
notice
of
the
forfeiture.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
they
are
not
bona
fide
purchasers
for
value,
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it...
it
requires
more
than
a
reason
to
suspect
the
nature
of
activities.
it
requires
that
you
have
notice
of
the
probable
forfeiture
of
the
particular
assets.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
not
likely
to
happen
with
respect
to
anyone
prior
to
indictment.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we're
really
realistically
only
talking
as
of
the
indictment.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
he...
he
conceded,
number
one,
that
he
had--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
his
plea
of
guilty
included
a
concession
that,
in
fact,
his
assets
over
a
course
of
many
years
were
essentially
all
the
product
of
narcotics
transactions
and
there
was
some
relation--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
he
pleaded
guilty
and
there
was
a
representation
on
his
part
that
there
had
been...
that
his...
his
assets,
essentially,
were
all
narcotics
tainted
there.
so,
he
did
much
more
than
simply
concede
that
he
had
committed
the
particular
crimes.
he
conceded
that
his...
the
assets
that
were
the
subject
of
the
indictment
and
named
in
the
indictment
were,
in
fact,
forfeitable
under
the
853(a).
so,
he
has
conceded--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
was...
in
monsanto,
he
didn't
concede
anything,
but
the
court
found--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--but
you
see,
the
court
in
monsanto--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
there
was
more
than
probable
cause
because
the
district
court
specifically
found
with
respect
to
the
only
two
assets
that
were
at
issue
in
monsanto,
that
they
were
forfeitable.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
was
an
issue
which
the
panel
in
monsanto
required
the
district
court
to
address,
and
the
district
court
did
address.
there
are
only
two
assets
at
issue
in
monsanto,
so
it's...
it's
pretty
simple.
here
there
are
many
more
in
caplin
&
drysdale.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
they
were
sham
transactions--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--you
could
well
conclude
from
that
that
that
lawyer
had
notice
of
the
probable
forfeitability
of
his
assets.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
fact
that
it--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
the
fact
that
it
was
a
sham
transaction
would
be
very
strong
proof
that
there
was
some
reason
for
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--for
the
fraudulent
transfer--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--which
would
be
in
anticipation--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right,
and...
and
the
statute...
under
common
law
forfeiture
principles,
we
would
have
an
absolute
right
to
all
that
money,
including
the
grocer's...
monies
paid
to
the
grocer,
whatever,
or
property
just
given
to
the
grocer
or
whatever.
but
there
is
an
exception.
congress
has
modified
that
admittedly--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--harsh
result
by
saying
in
two
settings,
we
will
not
require
forfeiture.
one
is
where
there
was
a
prior
interest
prior
to
the
commission
of
the...
of
the
act...
now,
that's
consistent
with
the
common
law
rule...
but,
two,
where
there
is
a
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value
without
notice.
in
the
second
setting,
that's
contrary
to
the
old
common
law
rule,
but
it
ameliorates
the
harshness
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
a
very
narrowly
defined
class
of
people
in...
among
whom
these
lawyers
clearly
do
not
fail.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
no.
the...
the...
well,
it's
a
little
complicated,
but
let
me
see
if
i
can
lay
it
out.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there
were
no
fees
paid.
the
only
thing
that
was
paid--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that...
that
is
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case.
there
was
a...
a
payment
of
$25,000
in
cash
on
january
25th--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--which
was
after
the
indictment,
but
mr.
lockwood
has...
has
said
today
that
that
was
for
pre-indictment
services.
and,
in
fact,
the
papers
in
the
lower
court
indicate
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
they
took
the
position--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--they
took
the...
well,
it...
it
is
money
which
was
accepted
after...
well,
i
mean,
the
first
problem
is
that
it
was
money
which
was
paid
contrary
to
the...
to
the
restraining
order.
but
in
any
event,
it
was
money
that
was
accepted
after
the...
the
attorneys
had
notice
of
the
indictment--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--and
therefore
were
aware.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
it's...
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
that's
the
$170,000.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
how,
those...
those
fees,
of
course,
have
not
been
transferred.
there
has
been
no
transfer,
and
that
is
one
at
the
reasons,
among
others,
that
the
attorneys
in
this
case
are
not
entitled
to
recovery
under
the
statute
because
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
provides
any
recovery...
any
opportunity
for
a
recovery
for
any
party,
there
must
be
an
actual
transfer
of
property.
the
statute
does
not
permit
recovery
for
a
party
which
is
simply
in
the
position
of
a
general
creditor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
is
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
as
the...
the
statute
states
now.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is
not...
that
is
not
entirely
clear
particularly
on
the
facts
of
this
$25,000
payment.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it...
it
may
will
be
that
the
purchase
was
effected
at
the
time
the
services
were
provided,
not
at
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--time
that
the
money
was
paid,
but
i'd
have...
i
have
to
point
out
that
in
the
lower
court,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
took
the
contrary
position
that...
saying
that
the
$25,000
was
paid
for
money...
was
paid
for
services
that
were
performed
after
the
indictments,
in
other
words,
in
connection
with
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--representation
of
the
case,
or
at
least
that's
the
way
i
read
their
representation
on
that.
so,
that...
the
disposition
of
the
$25,000
is
somewhat
up
in
the
air,
but
under
our--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--theory
of
the
case,
it
doesn't
matter
because
the
$170,000
that's
at
issue
here
is
clearly
and
concededly
not
subject
to
the
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
it
is
a
secured--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
it
is
an
unsecured
debt--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--and
the...
and
the
payment
is
made
to
somebody,
again,
with
notice--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
again,
it
depends
on
how
you
view
the...
the
term
"purchase".
if
the
purchase
occurs
at
the
time
the
service
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i...
i
think
one
could--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
we
believe
that
the
purchase
is
not
complete
until
the
money--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
your
honor.
there
is...
the
restraining
order
itself
clearly
can
be
obtained
simply...
as
the
statute
makes
clear,
simply
by
petitioning
to
the
district
court
ex
parte.
and,
in
fact,
there
is
a
lot
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
that...
it
is
important
that
it
be
able
to
be
done
that
way
because
of
the
possibility
of
transfers
being
done
very
quickly
if
notice
is
given
of
the
restraining
order.
the...
however,
as
the...
the
legislative
history
also
makes
clear,
the...
excuse
me...
the
court
certainly
can
hold
a
hearing
at
any
time
after
the
restraining
order
is
entered
to
consider
modifying
the
restraining
order
or
vacating
it
altogether.
now,
that's
when
in
our
view
any
process
that
may
be
due
is
properly
to
come
into
play.
so,
in
our
view,
the...
whatever
due
process
is
required
applies
to
any
hearing
that
may
be
held
on
a
motion
to
modify
the
restraining
order
if
one
has
been
entered
post-indictment.
the
actual
right
to
enter
the
restraining
order
initially
can...
applies...
it
could
be
done
ex
parte.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
applies
to
everyone
subject
to
rico
in
which
there
is
a
forfeiture
allegation.
i
would
have
to--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
would
hasten
to
point
out
that
the
number
of
cases
that
are
affected
is
vastly
more
in
the
context
of...
of
narcotics
forfeiture
than
rico.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there
are,
but
we
only
have
about
50
cases
a
year
in
which
rico
forfeitures
are
sought.
we
have
many
more
than
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
right,
but
then
we
only
have
about
100
ricos
a
year,
total.
it's...
rico
is...
you
see
a
lot
of
the
rico
cases,
of
course,
because
most
of
them
are
appealed
all
the
way
up,
but
in
spite
of
the
disproportionate
number
that
you
see,
there
are,
in
fact,
a
very
small
number
that
are
actually
brought.
so,
it's
100
cases
out
of
a
total
of
50,000
criminal
cases
that
are
brought
a
year.
so,
proportionately
the
vast
majority
of...
of
cases
in
which
forfeiture
is
going
to
be
an
issue
will
be
drug
cases.
that's
right.
now,
on
the
constitutional
question...
and
let
me...
let
me
turn
directly
to
that...
it
is
our
view
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
only...
with
respect
to
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice,
only
that
there
be
no
arbitrary
or
unreasonable
limitation
of
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice.
it's
different
from
the
right
to
counsel,
period.
and
the
question
then
in
this
case
is
does
the
forfeiture
statute
operate
in
a
way
that
is
somehow
arbitrary
or
unreasonable.
and
what
in
this
context
the
question
really
comes
down
to
is
is
it
arbitrary
or
unreasonable
to
bar
defendants
from
using
to
pay
lawyers'
fees
money
that
has
been
determined,
as
in
these
cases,
either
conclusively
or
by
overwhelming
evidence
to
be
subject
to
forfeiture,
to
be,
in
other
words,
the
government's
money.
now,
the
first
question
i
guess
one
could
start
with
is
to
say
is
there
any
constitutional
flaw
in
the
process
of...
or
in...
in
the
fact
of
determining
that
this
is,
in
fact,
the
tainted
money,
money
that
was
obtained
as
a
result
of
drug
transactions,
is
forfeitable.
is
there
any
fifth
amendment
bar
to
that?
now,
mr.
lockwood
said,
and
quite
correctly,
the
government
couldn't
simply...
the
congress
couldn't
simply
declare
that
mr.
lockwood's
funds
are
forfeitable,
all
of
his
property
is
forfeitable.
but
what
we
submit
there
would
be
absolutely
no
fifth
amendment
bar
to
is
a
rule
that
says
any
of
his
property
that
are
the
proceeds
of
drug
transactions
are
forfeitable.
and
that's
a...
a
traditional
civil
notion,
and
it
is,
we...
we'd
submit,
entirely
consistent
with
the
fifth
amendment
to
do
that.
that's
what
congress
has
done.
now,
once
you
accepted
that
it
is
permissible,
then
the
only
remaining
question
is
whether
there
is
something
arbitrary
about
saying
that
the
defendant
cannot
use
those
funds,
funds
that
the
government...
that
congress
has
declared
belong
to
the
government,
to
hire
a
lawyer.
there
is,
in
our
view,
no
sixth
amendment
right
to
use
somebody
else's
property
to
hire
a
lawyer,
and
that's
what's
going
on
in
this
case.
as
i
say,
we
have
in
this
case
established
with
a
high
degree
of
confidence
that
this
is
the
government's
property,
and
that
is
what
the
defendants
are
contending
for
is
that
even
though
the
government
has
established
that
it
is
government
property,
they
are
entitled
to
dip
into
that
property
to
the
extent
necessary
to
hire
the
lawyers
of
their
choice.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
it
probably
would
be
constitutional,
assuming
that
congress
had
some...
some
reasonable
purpose
behind--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
if
the
purpose
is
to
defraud...
deny
the...
specifically
to
deny
the
defendant
a
right
to
counsel,
then
i
think
there
are
problems
with
that
statute.
that
is,
of
course,
not
the
situation--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
would
be
the
discrimination,
specifically
picking
out
lawyers
if
there
is
no
reason
other
than
simply
to
hobble
the
defendant
in
his
defense,
if
that's
the
sole
purpose
of
this
rule.
we're
talking
about
a
very
narrow
and
unusual
statute,
but
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
this
was
not
specifically...
this
was
not...
this
is
a
general
policy.
this
is
not...
this
is
a
sweeping,
general,
overall
policy.
the
purposes
behind
this
policy
are
not
to
hobble
the
defendant.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there
are
no
exemptions.
that's
right.
this
is
not
a
statute
in
which
congress
has
set
out
to
skew
the
scales
between
the
defense
and
the...
and
the
government.
and
that
i
think
makes
a
big
difference
for
purposes
of
looking
at
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
there
are
a
lot
of
situations
in
which
the
defendant's
property
posture
with
respect
to
his
property
can
affect
the
likelihood
that
a
lawyer
will...
will
take
on
his
representation.
and
some
of
them
relate
to
the
defendant's
just
not
having
the
money.
others
relate
to
the
defendant's
situation
with
respect
to
other
creditors,
and
some
of
them
relate
to
problems
that
the
defendant
may
have
with
respect
to
creditors
where
the
creditor
is
the
government.
and
i
would
just
give
you
examples.
suppose,
for
example,
the
defendant
had...
prior
to
his
criminal
trial,
had
been
slapped
with
a
jeopardy
assessment
for
back
taxes
based,
let's
say,
on
the
narcotics
transactions
that
the
government
has
discovered.
that
would
discourage,
no
doubt,
some
lawyers
from
representing
the
defendant
on
the
theory
that
they
would
not
be
likely
to
get
paid
in
light
of
this
very
high
likelihood
that
the
jeopardy
assessment
would
result
in
tax--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it's
principally...
it's
fiscal
in
this
sense.
it's
fiscal
in
that
the
purpose
is
to
strip
drug
dealers
of
economic
power,
and
at
the
same
time
to
deter
drug
dealers
from
engaging
in
drug
dealings
when
they
expect,
as
they
have
in
the
past,
that
whatever
penalties
they
suffer,
they
will
not
lose
the
vast
profits
that
they
have
been
able
to
accumulate.
so,
it
is
deterrence
stripping
them
of
their
power,
and
also
to
collect
assets
in
order
to
continue
the
asset
forfeiture--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
can
be
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
he
knows
that
even
though
he
may
be
subject
to
forfeiture,
that
he
knows
that
he
can
exercise
some
considerable
economic
power
by
hiring
whatever
lawyer
he
wants
to
hire,
and
he
knows
also...
and
this
is
even--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i...
i
understand.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but,
nonetheless,
there
is...
it's
a
matter
of
considerable
comfort
i
think
to
a
lot
of
potential
defendants
in...
in
the
drug
trace
to
know
that
they
can
have
in
a
sense--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--they
were
assured
of
being
able
to
pay
us,
as
was
true
in
a
couple
of
the
cases
involving
this
issue.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
not
specifically
with
respect
to
lawyers.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i...
it
is
with
respect
to
not
allowing
them
to...
to
exercise
economic
power.
one
way--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--and
to...
to
make
whatever
other
uses
of
the
money
that
you
can
justify
to
a
district
court.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
government
is...
i
mean,
the
congress--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
is
certainly
true
that...
that
that
is
one
of
the
manifestations
of
economic
power
that
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--they
didn't
specifically
address
the
question.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
they...
they
did
not
specifically
want
to
deprive
anybody
of
counsel.
they
did
want
to
deprive
defendants
of
the
ability
to
spend
large
sums
of
money
on
whatever
resources
that
they--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no
restrictions.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the...
the
statute
is...
is
quite
sweeping,
that's
right,
except
for
the
provisions--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right,
your
honor,
to
anyone
who
isn't
a
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
there
was
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right,
whether
they
can
get
a
court
order
declaring
that
that
property
must
be
conveyed
back
to
the
government...
i
mean,
back
to
the
defendant
or
to
the
third
party.
that's
right.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--gold-plated
anything,
that's
right.
that's
right.
it
wasn't
specifically
addressed
to
lawyers.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
it
was
addressed
to
the
general--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
not
according
to
our
theory,
that's
right.
now,
the...
the...
caplin
&
drysdale
would
say
that
any
creditor
whose
credit...
whose
obligations...
the
obligations
to
whom
arose
because
of
ordinary
living
expenses
would
be
entitled
to
collect
under
the
statute.
that
is
not,
as
i
understand
it,
their
sixth
amendment
argument,
but
they
say
the
statute
provides
for--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--under
the
sixth
amendment,
they
do
take
that
position,
and
that
is
certainly
the
position
that
monsanto
takes.
their
argument
on
the
statute
goes
beyond
lawyers
and...
and
reaches
ordinary
living
expenses,
as
i
understand
it.
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right,
by
a
statute.
i
think
that
would
raise...
raise
serious
problems
unless
there
were
some
good
reason,
such
as
congress
deciding
there
was
a
serious
problem
with
the
narcotics
defense
bar
collecting
fees,
and
they
specifically
addressed
that
problem
of
collecting
huge
fees
under
dubious
circumstances.
there
very
well
might
be
a
statute
that
would
be
constitutional
if
it
addressed
that
problem
for
that
reason.
but
if
it
was
simply
designed
in
order
to
skew
the
balance
against
the
defendant
and
for
no
other
purpose,
then
i
think
there
would
be
a
problem.
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's...
that's
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
that's
the
purpose
of
this
statute,
that...
if
another
purpose...
well,
thank
you.
