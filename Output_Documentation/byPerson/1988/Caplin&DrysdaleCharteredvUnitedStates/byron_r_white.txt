justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
claim
is
limited
to
compensation
for
services
performed
prior
to
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
you
should
be
paid
either
before
or
after
conviction
for
those
services.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you...
it's
your
position
that...
i
mean,
that...
that
relation
back
to
the
date
of
the
offense
is
just...
you
shouldn't
construe
the
statute
that
way
or
that
if
you
do,
it's
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
an...
what
about
just
a
bank
loan
that
the
defendant
owed
and
was
due
and
it
was
owing?
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
the
bank
can
collect
that?
or
are
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--[inaudible]
something
special
out
of
the
fact
that
these
are
counsel
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
bank
loan?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lockwood,
you
would...
i
gather
you...
in
this
example
about
the
car,
you...
it
was
necessary
for
you
to
reach
the
sixth
amendment
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
you
concede
that
the...
that
the
statute
and
the
forfeiture
provision
covers
that
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
had
to...
the
government
had
to
prove
that
the
property
was
actually
forfeitable
in
the
sense
that
it
was
a...
used
in
or
a
product
of
criminal
activity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not...
just
not...
not
just
by
pleading
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
he
did
was
plead
guilty,
though,
isn't
it?
he
didn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that's
certainly
not
true
in
monsanto,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
there
was...
there
was
just
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
had
committed
these
crimes--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
not
probable
cause
to
say
that
every
asset
he
had
was
forfeitable.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
at
issue
here
some...
some...
some
payment
of
an
attorney's
fees
prior
to
the
plea
of
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it...
is
that
just
the
$29,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean,
just
generally
there
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--there's
no
fees
paid
prior
to
the
plea
of
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think
that
is
recoverable
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
theory,
i
would
think
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
you
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it's
recoverable
under
your
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
have
been
even
if
they
had...
they
just
don't
qualify
for
bona
fide
purchaser.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now...
and
but
now,
there
is
also
at
issue
attorneys'
fees
that
are
due
and
owing
after
the
plea--
justice
byron
r.
white
--for...
for--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
going
to
argue
the
constitutional
issue
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
an
order
of
forfeiture
entered
in
cases
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
the
issue
here...
the...
this
property
x...
bank
account
x,
for
example,
is
forfeited
to
the
government,
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
attorneys
may
collect
out
of
that
forfeited
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
lawyers--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
gold-plating
or
even
food,
for
that
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
you...
any
other
creditors,
if
they
weren't
a
bona
fide
purchaser
of
value,
couldn't...
couldn't
collect
out
of
that
forfeited
property
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
they...
their
argument
is
that
lawyers
at
least
should
be
treated
specially.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
still
are--
justice
byron
r.
white
--wanting
to...
wanting
to
collect
your
attorneys'
fees
out
of
property
that
has
been
ordered
forfeited.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
the
answer
is
yes.
