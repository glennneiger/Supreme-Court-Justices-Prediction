justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lockwood,
what
if
the
defendant
has
as
his
property
a
stash
of
narcotics,
which
he
had
been
planning
to
sell,
and
also
money
that
he
had
obtained
from
prior
sales
of
narcotics
according
to
the
government's
allegations?
do
you
think
that
he
can
use
that
money
constitutionally
pending
the
trial
and
conviction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
the
government
has
a
different
interest
there
so
it
can
prevent
the
use
of
that
money
that
it
alleges
were
simply
obtained
by
drug
sales?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
we
sure
of
that?
could
it...
could
it
not
incorporate
taking
the
proceeds
of
crime
that
are
usable
as
evidence
or
for
any
other
purpose
in
the
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bryson,
what
if
we
thought
that
it
was
necessary
before
trial
that
there
be
a
hearing
at
which
evidence
would
be
taken
and
the
defendant
would
have
an
opportunity
to
rebut
the
government's
claims,
and
that
procedural
due
process
requires
that?
what
does
that
do
in
the
caplin
case
do
you
think?
your
honor,
nothing
at
all
because
here,
as
i
say,
the
request
for
a
modification
and
a
hearing
on
the...
on
the
motion
for
modification
was
filed
on
march
7th.
the
hearing
was...
came
or
quite
quickly,
on
march
15th.
but,
in
fact,
in
the
meantime,
on
march
14th,
the
defendant
had
pleaded
guilty
and
had
conceded
forfeitability.
so,
there
was
nothing
to
hear
at
that
point.
all
that
was
presented
at
that
point
was
the
naked
constitutional
and
statutory
question.
now,
in
the
monsanto
case,
there
is
a
pretrial
hearing.
and
that
hearing,
we
contend,
was
beyond
what
any
court
has
required
that
has
required
some
kind
of
due
process
hearing
because
in
that
hearing,
not
only
was
it
an
adversarial
hearing
and
a
four-day
hearing
at
that,
in
which
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
put
on
any
evidence
that...
that
he
chose,
but
also
the
finding
that
the
property
was
forfeitable
was
made
by
a
standard
of
proof
beyond
clear
and
convincing.
so,
our...
our
point
is
that
in...
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
court
does
not
have
to
address
the
question
of
what
procedure
is
necessary
because
whatever
procedure
is
necessary
was
necessarily
satisfied
here.
well,
mr.
bryson,
you
say
that
as
soon
as
he
pled
guilty,
he
was...
he
conceded
forfeitability.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bryson,
you
say
you
don't
have
to
address
it
here,
but
do
you
think
that
a
post-indictment
restraining
order
can
be
obtained
ex
parte
by
the
government?
