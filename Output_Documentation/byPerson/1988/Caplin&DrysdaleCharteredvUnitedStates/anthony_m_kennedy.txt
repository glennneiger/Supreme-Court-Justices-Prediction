but
the
only
legitimate
basis
for
imposing
the
penalty
is
the
wrongful
act
and,
therefore,
it
is
perfectly
proper...
in
fact,
i
should
think
necessary...
for
the
government
to
make
the
statute
relate
back
to
the
occurrence
of
the
wrongful
act,
which
is
all
it
has
done
here.
that
is
the
whole
predicate
for
the
government
asserting
the
ownership
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that...
that's
the
issue.
you
see,
you...
you
defined
status
quo,
but
i
suggest
the
fantacy
in
that...
the
use
of
that
word
is
that
your
definition
of
the
status
quo
includes
the
defendant's
balance
sheet
after
he
has
acquired
illegal
assets.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
the
whole
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
one
more
question--
--suppose
the
bills
are--
--if
i
may.
you
use
the
word
penalize
the
defendant.
in
a
standard
unjust
enrichment
action
that
has
been
known
to
the
common
law
for
years,
we
never
talk
about
penalizing
the
person
who
has
been
unjustly
enriched
when
we
make
that
person
disgorge,
do
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
position
is
there
no
unjust
enrichment
in
the
prospect
of
a
dope
dealer
keeping
the
proceeds
of
his
transaction?
that
is
not
unjust
enrichment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
suppose
you
had
a
statute
which
permitted
the
defendant
to
have
ordinary
living
expenses
and
to
pay
for
grocery
and
medical
bills,
but
it
specifically
prevented
use
of
the
proceeds
to
pay
an
attorney.
there
was
no
exemption
for
that.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
purpose
is
so
that
the
defendant
doesn't
hire
a
first-rate
attorney.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can...
if
it's
the
government's
money,
can't
the
government
say
we
don't
want
you
to
be
using
this
money
to
hire
the
best
law
firm
in
the
united
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
agree
that
lawyers
can't
be
singled
out,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
it's
not
designed
to
skew
the
balance.
it's
designed
to
prevent
money
that
the
government
owns
from
being
used
for
that
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
skewing
the
balance?
