we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-1729,
caplin
&
drysdale
v.
united
states.
mr.
lockwood,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lockwood,
what
are
the
requirements
for
a
forfeiture?
that
the...
the
monies
or
property
have
been
acquired
as
a
result
of
the
drug
activities?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
mean
so
much
the
various
kinds
of
properties,
but
what
does
the
government
have
to
show
in
order
to
forfeit
any
property?
that
it
be
acquired
from
drug
proceeds?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
basis
for
the
forfeiture
against
reckmeyer
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--doesn't
the
court
have...
doesn't
the
court
have
to
make
any
findings
or
anything
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that...
is
that
your
principal
contention
here,
that
the
forfeiture...
or
the
tying
up
of
the
assets
simply
on
the
basis
of
an
indictment
is
not
right?
i
thought
you
would
object
also
to
a
later
recapture
of
those,
even
after
a
conviction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
isn't
just
the
fact
that
it
is
just
an
indictment.
you
object
to
the
thing
even
after
a
conviction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
like
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
is
like
a
lis
pendens
in
a
civil
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
the
money
that
is
claimed
to
be
the
proceeds
of
a
bank
robbery?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
see
visions
of
the
future.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but...
but
why
can't
the
federal
government
make
property
law
the
same
way
state
governments
make
property
law
when
they
say
that
the...
that
the
money
deposited
in
a
bank
belongs
to
a
bank?
why
can't
the
federal
government
say
on
the
happening
of
certain
events,
this
property
belongs
to
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
if
you
applied
the
government's
rationale
to
your
rather
standard
forfeiture
of
an
automobile
used
in
transporting
drugs,
nothing
to
do
with
cce
or
rico?
you
know,
they've
had
that
statute
on
the
books
for
years.
would
it
be
your
position
that
the
government
could
not
seize
an
automobile
that
it
claimed
was
used
for
transporting
drugs
until
the
person
had
been
convicted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguish
that
case
from
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
suppose
it...
let's
suppose
it
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to...
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
the
defendant
doesn't
sell
it...
doesn't
sell
it
before
the
forfeiture
proceedings
are
completed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
terribly
unusual.
i
mean,
typically
a
libel
in
a
case
like
that
proceeds
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
just
like
here
you
have
an
indictment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lockwood.
mr.
bryson?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
fraudulent
conveyance
law,
under
voidable
preference
law
in
bankruptcy,
it
has
to
be
a
fresh
service
performed.
a
payment
on
an
old
debt
doesn't
make
you
a
bona
fide
purchaser.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
lockwood,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lockwood.
the
case
is
submitted.
