justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
push
you
one
step
further.
supposing
the
government
had
made
a
controlled
buy
of
drugs
and
paid
the
defendant
$500,000
with
marked
bills.
you...
you
wouldn't
say
that
they...
they
couldn't...
the
government
couldn't
get
those
bills
back.
you
couldn't
use
that
money
to
hire
a
lawyer,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
also,
of
course,
they
would
be
the
property
of
the
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
of
course,
you
didn't
have
that
before
the
guilty
plea.
you
didn't
have
that
degree
of
certitude
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
true.
but
during
that
six-week
period,
you
did
not
have
the
certitude
that
you
had
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
part
of
the
issue
is
what
can
be
done
during
that
six-weeks
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
h
makes...
pays
his
landlord
his
rent
during
that
six-weeks
period,
and
the
landlord
hears
about
the
indictment
and
has
reason
to
be
believe
maybe
this
fellow
is
a
crook
and
maybe
this
is
tainted
money.
but
your
position
is
the
landlord
cannot
take
the
money
during
that
period,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
landlord
has
to
refuse
to
accept
any
rent
from
him,
too,
i
guess.
i...
we're
talking
about
the
rights
of
third
parties--
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
long
as
there
is
enough
information
in
the
newspapers
and
headlines
to
put
him
on
notice
that
it
may
be...
and
i
suppose
the
grocer
and
the
doctor
that
he
goes
to
or
the
dentist,
all
those
people
can't...
can't...
cannot
treat
him
without
doing
so
at
their
peril.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
assuming
wide
publicity
of...
attending
the
indictment
and
people
who
have
treated
this
man
for
many,
many
years.
and
i
assume
that
would
go
back,
would
it
not,
to
even...
how
far
back
do
you
go?
when
the
offense
was
committed...
say
he's
indicted
for
drug
business.
he
had
been
in
it
for
five
or
six
years,
say.
can
all
the
people
who
have
dealt
with
him
during
that
period
with
some
reason
to
suspect
the
nature
of
the
activities--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
really
we're
only
concerned
about
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
period
between
the
indictment
and
the
conviction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
before
i...
about
the
relation
back
business?
is
it
not
true
that
although
the
third
parties
who
deal
in
good
faith
with
the
man
would...
prior
to
indictment
would
have
no
risk.
if
you
had
sham
transactions
prior
to
the
indictment,
but
after
the
date
of
the
first
offense,
they
could
be
set
aside
and
the
money
could
be
recovered,
could
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say...
say
he
had
a
lawyer
who
just
took
a
$5
million
fee
because...
for
general
services
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
i
mean,
assuming
that
you
can
prove
that
the...
that
the
third
had...
had...
had
notice
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
fact
it
was
probably
drug--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
your
right...
i
mean,
the
government's
right
is
to
get
the
money...
all
money
earned
by
the
defendant
out
of
the
offense
all
the
way
back
to
the
date
his
illegal
activities
commenced.
justice
john
paul
stevens
xxx.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
supposing
the
man
has
a
genuine
preexisting
debt
of
a
mortgage
or
something
for
$100,000,
and
pays
that
off
after
the
indictment,
but
before
the
guilty
plea,
is
that
money
recoverable
by
the
government?
he's
apparently
using
government
money
to
pay
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
an
unsecured
debt,
but
a
genuine
debt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
bought
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
at
the
time
of
the
payment,
notice;
at
the
time
of
the
services,
no
notice.
i'm
assuming
it's
a
payment
for
a
preexisting
debt
that
was
incurred
by
the...
that
the
services
were
performed...
really
the
problem
justice
scalia
identified.
he
is
paying
that
debt
with
the
government
money
i
think
under
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
wondering...
i'm
asking
you
how
do
you
view
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
one
can
argue
both
sides.
how
do
you
argue
it?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
for
your
view.
unlike
justice
scalia's
suggestion,
it's
the
time
of
payment
because
it's
being
paid
with
government
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
preliminary
question
because
i...
you
do...
you
do
have...
fortunately
you
have
two
hours
today,
so
we're
not
quite
as
unfair
as
we
sometimes
are.
the
general
scheme
is
the
some
under
both
the
rico
statute
and
the
cce
statute--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that
whatever
we
decide
pertaining
to
the
drug
business
applies
to
everyone
subject
to
rico,
too.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
say
that?
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
rico
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
potentially
there
are
an
awful
lot
more
than
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
mr.
bryson,
the
jeopardy
assessment
would
be
justified
by
the
government's
legitimate
interest
in
fiscal
purposes,
collecting
tax
money
that
is
due.
and
we
had
a
little
discussion
earlier
about
what
really
is
the
motivation
for
this
whole
program.
we've
heard
your
opponent's
view.
is
it
fiscal
in
nature
or...
is
that
part
of
it,
or
is
it...
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
to
the
extent
you
talk
about
stripping
the
defendant
of
economic
power,
that
purpose
is
not
defeated
if
some
of
the
money
is
spent
for
legitimate
living
expenses
and
attorneys'
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wells,
but
we're
not
talking
about
sham
transactions
now.
we're
talking
about
hiring
reputable
counsel
who
charge
normal
legal
rates
or
paying
normal
food
bills.
and
so,
we
are
not
talking
about
just
extravagant
living
and
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
part
of
the
motivation
then
is
to
deprive
them
of
that
right
to
select
lawyers
that
they
think
they'd
like
to
have
represent
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
one...
one
way
of
exercising
economic
power,
as
you
define
it,
is
to
hire
the
counsel
of
your
choice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i...
am
i
right
in
saying
that
the
desire
of
the
defendant
to
hire
counsel
of
his
or
her
choice
is
part
of
the
economic
power
the
government
seeks
to
take
away
from
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
or
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
you
think
congress
intended
to
deprive
the
defendant
of.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
they
said
just
the
opposite
is
the
only
comment
on
the
issue
that
i
remember.
