justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean...
there...
there...
there
is
not
agreement
on
both
sides
that
that's
the
only
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a...
that's
a
different
theory.
now...
now,
you're
getting
into
the
right
to
counsel
aspect
of
it.
you
said
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
a
short
time
ago
that
on...
your
objection
to
relation
back
means
that
you
would
not
draw
a
distinction
between
attorney's
fees
and
other
necessary
living
expenses.
if
i...
but
if
i
understand
your...
your
theory
correctly,
you
shouldn't
be
drawing
a
distinction
between
attorneys'
fees
and
anything
else
the
individual
does
with
the
money.
he
could
go
out
and
just
say,
you
know,
i
know
i'm
going
to
get
convicted.
they
have
the
goods
on
me.
boy,
i'm
going
to
really
live
for
the
two
years
it
takes
for
this
trial
to
be...
to
be
completed.
isn't...
isn't
that
consequence
of
your
theory?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
go
through
that
money
completely.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
if...
if
it
can't
make
any
relation
back?
he
doesn't
owe
any
money
to
the
government
until
he
is
convicted.
it's
his
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
must
be
reasoning
from
something
else
other
than
the
mere
relation
back
then.
i
mean,
you
must
be
relying
on
the...
on
right
to
counsel
or
some
other...
some
other
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
if
you
really
think
that
you
can't
take
it
away
from
him
until
he
is
convicted,
he
ought
to
have
the
right
to
do
whatever
he
wants
with
that
money
during
the
period
while
the
trial
is
continuing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
assert
that
the
fifth
amendment
issue,
the
due
process
issue,
is
not
involved
here
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
to
whether
you
need
a
hearing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
what
has
to
be
shown
at
that
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
i...
to
be
a
bona
fide
purchaser,
you...
you
have...
you
have
to
know
about
the
possible
forfeiture
not
when
you
received
the
money,
but
when
you
provide
the
services.
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
isn't
that
what
counts,
whether
at
the
time
you
provide
the
services,
you...
you...
you're
on
notice?
so,
wouldn't
it
be
the
case
that
if
the
lawyers,
prior
to
the
indictment,
didn't...
any
services
they
provided
before
the
indictment...
why
is
that
automatic--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
purchase
when
i
provide
the
services
for
which
that's
the
exchange.
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
is
it
when
i...
when
he...
when
he
turns
it
over
to
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
very
strange
rule
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
if
it
isn't
clear,
i
know
how
it
ought
to
come
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
statute
is
okay
because
it
doesn't
allow
him
to
keep
money
for
food
either.
is
that
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
are
no
exemptions.
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
essentially
the
government
didn't
want...
want
him
to
have
gold-plated
anything,
watches
or
lawyers
or
anything
else.
