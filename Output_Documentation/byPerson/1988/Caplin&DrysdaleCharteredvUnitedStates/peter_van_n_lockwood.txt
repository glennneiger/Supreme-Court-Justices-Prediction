mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
that
the
court
is
faced
with
here
today
is
whether
the
comprehensive
forfeiture
act
of
1984
and
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution
permit
the
federal
government
to
deprive
a...
an
unconvicted
defendant
of
access
to
his
assets
to
employ
counsel
to
defend
him
against
the
very
charges
on
which
the
proposed
forfeiture
in
the
indictment
is
based
and
to
obtain
necessary
living
expenses.
the
facts,
briefly
stated,
in
caplin
&
drysdale
are...
is
that
the
petitioner,
the
law
firm
of
caplin
&
drysdale,
was
retained
in
the
summer
of
1983
by
the
defendant
christopher
reckmeyer
to
represent
him
in
a
matter
then
understood
to
be
a
grand
jury
investigation
involving
possible
federal
tax
evasion.
in
january
of
1985,
reckmeyer
was
indicted
for
not
only
a
multiplicity
of
tax
crimes,
but
a
multiplicity
of
drug
crimes
and
a...
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
or
cce.
the
indictment
also
contained
what
i
will
refer
to
in
shorthand
as
blanket
forfeiture
allegations
which
essentially
sought
forfeiture
of
every
asset
reckmeyer
owned
that
was
worth
more
than
$1,000.
approximately
simultaneously
with
the
entry
of
the
indictment,
the
government,
ex
parte,
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
reckmeyer
and
all
persons
acting
in
concert
with
him
from
transferring
any
of
the
assets
listed
as
forfeitable
in
the
indictment.
immediately
prior
to
the
indictment,
reckmeyer
had
paid
caplin
&
drysdale
$10,000
by
check
for
previously
incurred
legal
fees.
that
check...
those
checks
were
returned
unpaid
by
the
banks
as
a
result
of
the
restraining
order.
shortly
after
the
indictment,
reckmeyer
paid
caplin
&
drysdale
approximately
$25,000
in
cash,
again
for
previous...
pre-indictment
legal
services.
because
of
the
restraining
order,
caplin
&
drysdale
deposited
that
money
in
an
escrow
account
and
immediately
notified
both
the
court
and
the
government
of
its
receipt
of
those
funds.
thereafter,
caplin
&
drysdale
continued
to
represent
reckmeyer
in
the
criminal
proceedings.
some
weeks
after
the
indictment,
caplin
&
drysdale
filed
on
reckmeyer's
behalf
a
motion
with
the
district
court
for...
to
amend
the
temporary
restraining
order
to
allow
reckmayer
access
to
his
restrained
assets
to
pay
counsel
and,
in
addition,
requested
that
the
assets
so
relieved
from
restraint
would
be
exempted
from
subsequent
forfeiture
in
the
event
reckmeyer
should
be
convicted.
that
motion
came
on
for
a
hearing,
but
the
day
prior
to
the
hearing,
reckmeyer
pleaded
guilty.
as
a
result,
the
district
court
deferred
ruling
on
the
motion
to
some
post-conviction
procedures
under
subsection
n(2)
of
the
cce
forfeiture
statute.
at
that
subsequent...
subsequent
hearing,
caplin
&
drysdale
at
this
point,
petitioning
on
its
own
behalf
for
the
fees,
pursuant
to
the
court's
instruction...
and
the
court
granted
caplin
&
drysdale's
motion.
in
the
interim,
while
those
proceedings
were
transpiring,
reckmeyer
also
consented
to
the
entry
of
a
forfeiture
decree
against
him,
which
once
again
covered
all
the
assets
listed
in
the
indictment
and
included
the
bank
accounts
on
which
the
$10,000
in
unpaid
checks
were
drawn
and
the
25,000
odd
dollars
that
was
in
the
possession
of
caplin
&
drysdale
in
the
escrow
account.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
chief
justice
rehnquist,
there
are
a
variety
of
properties
which
are
subject
to
forfeiture
in
section
853(a).
they
include
proceeds
of
drug
transactions,
but--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--the
government
has
to
show...
well,
the
government
first
has
to
convict
the
defendant.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
secondly,
having
convicted
it,
it
has
to
show
that
the
property
was
either
obtained
or
used
in
the
manner
proscribed
by
the
statute
itself
which,
as
i
say,
involves
a
variety
of
different
considerations
including,
for
example,
that
the
property
in
a
rico
case,
which
has
an
identical
statute
to
the
one
at
issue
here,
was
a
portion
of
the
enterprise
that
the
defendant
conducted
by
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
for
example,
if
an
enterprise
is
a
legitimate
business,
but
the
defendant
participated
in
two
or
more
predicate
crimes
which
were
deemed
to
be
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
the
defendant's
entire
interest
in
the
enterprise
could
be
forfeited,
not
merely
that
portion
of
the
enterprise's
assets
that
resulted
from
the
criminal
activity.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
well,
the
ultimate
basis
was
reckmeyer's
consent.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
there
was
never
any
litigation
or
findings--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--not
if
the
defendant
consents.
it's...
it's
just
like
a
guilty
plea
in
that
regard,
your
honor.
the...
we
believe
there
are
certain
basic
principles
that
have
to
be
kept
in
mind
in
evaluating
the
arguments
over
whether
or
not
the
lower
court
was
correct
in
ruling
that
caplin
&
drysdale
should
be
paid
the
legal
fees
from
reckmeyer's
assets
that
it
had
earned,
or
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
en
banc
was
correct
in
holding
that
neither
the
statute
nor
the...
the
applicable
constitutional
provisions
authorize
such
a
result.
the
first
point
is
that,
unlike
the
government's
argument
at
various
places
in
its
brief
which
suggests
that
this
is
simply
a
dispute
over
property
rights,
forfeiture
is
a
criminal
penalty
in
this
statute.
it
is
imposed
only
upon
conviction
of
the
defendant
and
is...
it
was
enacted
as
an
effort
to
punish
the
defendant
for
his
wrongful
conduct
and
deter
others
from
engaging
in
similar
conduct.
the
restraining
order
provisions
in
both
the
cce
and
the
rico
statutes
were
intended
by
congress...
this
much
both
sides
agree
on...
to
prevent
a
defendant
from
avoiding
the
impact
of
forfeiture
by
disposing
of
his
property
prior
to
forfeiture
but
after
indictment
in
a
manner
which
would,
for
example,
allow
him
to
retain
the
economic
and
beneficial
ownership
of
that
property,
which
we
would
refer
to
as
a
sham
transaction,
or
which
would
enable
his
organization...
the
statute...
these
statutes
were,
after
all,
aimed
at
criminal
organizations...
to
maintain
its
continued
use
of
the
assets
in
criminal
activity.
this
would
be
involved
in
transferring
assets
to
other
members
of
the
criminal
organization.
the
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--your...
justice
scalia,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
it
was
agreement
that
that
was
the
only
purpose.
it
is
agreement
that
that
is
a
major
purpose.
i
was
about
to
say
that
the...
the
disagreement
between
the
parties
has
to
do
with
how
much
farther
congress
intended
to
go
than
those
basic
purposes
and
specifically
whether
congress
intended
that
the
government,
by
indicting
a
defendant
and
including
blanket
forfeiture
allegations,
could
in
fact
render
a
defendant
functionally
indigent
prior
to
the
time
of
his
conviction
for
the
offenses
on
which
the
forfeiture
charges
were
based.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
that
is
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
that
is
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
our
view
is
that
the
so-called
relation-back
provision
of
the
statute
which
purports
to
vest
title
to
the...
of
the
defendant's
asset
in
the
government
at
the
time
the
defendant
committed
the
crime
and
therefore
prohibits
the
transfer
of
any
such
assets
to
a
third
party
at
any
time
after
that
crime,
subject
to
very
narrow
exceptions,
has
exactly
the
same
practical
effect
as
restraint
because
no
third
party,
whether
they
be
a
lawyer,
a
grocer,
a
surgeon
or
whoever,
who
is...
who
is
aware
through
publicity
or
otherwise
that
the
defendant
has
been
indicted
is
going
to
transfer
goods
or
services
to
the
defendant--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--in
exchange
for
money
that
the
government
can
come
and
take
back
if
the
defendant
is
convicted.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
short
of
the
formality
of
filing
the
lis
pendens
with
the
court,
it
is
exactly
the
same,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
prior
to
conviction,
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
as
long
as
the
services
were
rendered
prior
to
conviction,
it
is
our
position
that
the
procedural
context
of
when
the
lower
court
got
around
to
deciding
that
we
were
entitled
to
be
paid
is
irrelevant.
the...
the
key
factor
is
that
reckmeyer
had
a...
a
statutory
and
constitutional
right
to
pay
us
prior
to
his
conviction,
and
the
conviction
does
not
cut
that
right
off,
as
the
government
seems
to
suggest.
the...
part
of
the...
the
issue
here
is
that
the
government's
arguments
about
why
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
in
the
way
it
claims,
which
is
to
provide
that
this
pre-conviction
impact
through
either
restraint
or
threat
of
forfeiture
is
appropriate,
is
that
the
government
has
a
legitimate
interest
which
the
congress
in
its
view
clearly
intended
in
drafting
of
this
statute
in
maximizing
the
forfeiture
penalty
by
"preserving
assets
for
forfeiture".
it
is
our
position
that,
if
analyzed
correctly,
that
interest,
to
the
extent
that
it
purports
to
be
penal,
cannot
be
given
any
legal
or
constitutional
effect
prior
to
conviction.
you
cannot
punish
someone
prior
to
the
time
they
are
convicted
of
the
crime.
so--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--we
do
not--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--well,
under
the
statute--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--well,
we
are
and
we
aren't,
justice
white.
we...
we...
in
the
pre-conviction
setting,
we
would
not
under
the
statute,
as
opposed
to
the
sixth
amendment
argument,
distinguish
between
counsel
fees
and
other
necessary
living
expenses.
we
don't--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--a
bank
loan,
depending
upon
the
circumstances
under
which
it
would
be
made,
the
bank
could
very
well
qualify
as
a
bona
fide
for...
purchaser
for
value
without
notice.
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
government
and...
and
various
claimants
in
the
lower
courts,
which
is
not
presented
by
this
case,
over
whether
a
"mere
creditor"
can
get
assets
that
are
not
forfeited
if
the
bank
did
not
obtain
a
security
interest.
it's
clear
under
the
statute
if
the
bank
loaned
money
and
obtained
a
security
interest
prior
to
the
time
the
defendant
was
indicted,
the
bank
could
get
the
repayment
of
that
loan
out
of
the
forfeited
assets.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
chief
justice
scalia,
we
would...
excuse
me...
chief
justice
rehnquist.
[laughter]
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
we
would
argue
that
the
bank
robbery
analogy
is
not
apt.
in
the
bank
robbery
analogy,
you
have
a
common
law
fight
over
title
to
property.
we
do
not
posit
that
reckmeyer
or
anybody
else
has
the
right
to
use
somebody
else's
property
to
pay
a
lawyer
or
for
any
other
purpose.
but
here,
the
notion
that
the
assets
that
reckmeyer
has
in
his
possession
at
the
time
of
indictment
belonged
to
the
government--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--by
operation
is
a
fiction.
it's
a
penalty.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
they
can,
provided
that
they
have
a
particular,
legitimate
constitutional
purpose.
the
congress
under
the
taking
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
could
not
pass
a
statute
that
said
peter
lockwood's
property
belongs
to
the
government.
there
has
to
have
a
legitimate
purpose.
in
this
case
the...
the
legitimate
purpose
behind
the
forfeiture
statute
is
the...
is
penalizing
criminals.
our...
we
do
not
challenge
the
legitimacy
of
that
purpose.
we
challenge
the
impact
of
the
penalty
being
applied
prior
to
the
time
that
the
defendant
is
convicted.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy,
as
long
as
you
don't
push
the
principle
too
far
because
if
the
issue...
to
the
extent
the
statute
and
the
forfeiture
provisions
are
directed
at
the
defendant
himself,
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
statute
by
way
of
a
penalty
to
look
back
to
the
time
that
the
criminal
act
was
committed
for
purpose
of
identifying
the
forfeitable
property.
when
you
get
to
transfers
to
third
parties
who
are
presumptively
innocent,
different
considerations
are
presented,
and
where
you
get
to
depriving
a
defendant
under
the
notion
that
we
are
going
to
take
this
property
from
him
after
he
is
convicted,
depriving
him
of
the
use
of
property
to
hire
a
lawyer
to
defend
himself
against
the
very
charges
which,
if
he
wins,
the
forfeiture
will
not
occur,
we...
we
urge
that
that
is
a
very
draconian
type
of
remedy.
it
is
an
infliction
of
punishment.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
justice
scalia,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
i
don't
believe
so.
we
would--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--we
would
concede
that
the
government
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
preventing
the
defendant
from
simply
wasting
money
that
he
believes
he
will
ultimately
have
to
turn
over
to
the
government.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
we
didn't
say
that
the
relation-back
doctrine
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
we
were...
we...
i'm
arguing
that
the
relation-back
doctrine
cannot
legitimately
be
used
in
a
very
limited
class
of
cases
where
the
impact
of
the
use
of
the
relation-back
doctrine
is
not
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
which
is
the
normal
purpose
for
equitable
relief,
but
to
dramatically
alter
the
status
quo
to
the
defendant's
is
detriment
by
rendering
him
indigent
functionally
by
mere
indictment
alone.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
well,
we...
the
statutory--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--in
the
statutory
context,
justice
scalia,
we
are
relying
on
language
in
the
statute
which
we
contend
gives
the
court
an
equitable
discretion
both
under
the
restraining
order
provisions
and
under
the
relation-back
provisions.
and
that
involves
balancing
of
hardships
in
the
government's
interest.
and
we
concede
that
the...
in
that
context,
the
government's
interest
in
avoiding
the
dissipation
of
assets,
whether
it's
through
a
restraining
order
or
the
application
of
relation-back
principles,
is
entitled
to
sufficient
weight
to
prohibit
what
your
honor
has
suggested
would
be
otherwise
appropriate,
namely,
dissipation
of
assets.
we
suggest,
as
did
judge
winter
in
his
opinion
in
monsanto,
that
the
equitable
discretion
inherent
in
the
statute
cannot
be
utilized,
however,
to
render
the
defendant
a
pauper.
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
argument,
we...
we...
we
say
that...
our
argument
is
essentially
that
you've
got
to
balance
the
invasion
of
the
defendant's
right
to
counsel
of
choice
against
the
government's
interest.
the
relation-back
principle
in
that
context...
the
government's
interest
in
its
application
is
to
maximize
the
amount
of
money
it
will
collect
as
a
penalty
from
the
defendant
when
he
is
convicted.
that
is
its
only
legitimate
interest.
it
does
not
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
putting
the
defendant
in
a
posture
in
which
the
government
picks
his
lawyer
and
chooses
how
much
to
pay
his
lawyer.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
justice
kennedy--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--justice
kennedy,
the
problem
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
impact
of
the
restraint
and
forfeiture,
the
defendant's
assets
are
only
claimed
by
the
government
to
be
illegal.
they
have
not
been
proven
to
be
illegally
obtained,
and
they
will
only
be
so
proven
when
the
defendant
is
convicted
at
the
criminal
trial.
but
the
government,
if
the
statute
is
to
be
interpreted
the
way
it
argues,
is
in
effect
tying
one
hand
behind
the
defendant's
back
by
depriving
him
of
his
ability
to
hire
a
lawyer
to
contest
the
charges
on
which
the
proposed
forfeiture
is
based.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
we
would
concede
he
could
not
use
the
narcotics.
narcotics
are
contraband.
nobody
maintains...
can
maintain
legal
title
in
them,
and
they
cannot
be
sold.
with
respect
to
the
money,
money
is
fungible.
the
money
may
or
may
not,
in
fact,
be
the
proceeds
of
narcotics
transactions.
no
one
will
know
until
the
defendant
is
convicted
and
the
forfeiture
allegations
are
litigated
with--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--i
think
the
government's
interest
at
all
times
in
this
criminal
forfeiture
penalty
in
this
statute
that
is
before
the
court
is
in
penalizing
the
defendant
by
stripping
him
of
his
assets
that
were
illegally
obtained.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
the
government
could,
i
believe,
make
a
different
case
from
the
one
that
is
presented
here
if
the
assets
sought
to
be
seized
were
alleged
to
be
needed
to
be
used
for
evidence
because
that
gets
into
a
different
set
of
constitutional
considerations
more
like
the
typical
ones
that
this
court
has
upheld
in...
in
prior
cases
where
counsel
of
choice
was
at
issue,
namely,
the
due
and
fair
administration
of
justice.
here,
where
the
only
interest
is
money,
the
only
interest
on
the
government
side
of
the
equation
is
maximization
of
the
penalty
regardless
of
what
the
basis
for
that
penalty
is.
the...
the
government's
rationale
could
as
easily
apply
in
this
case
to...
to
tying
up
assets
of
a
defendant
to
enable
him
to
pay
fines.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
no,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
well,
for
openers,
we
would...
i
would
not...
i
would
need
to
know
whether
the
automobile
was
the
only
asset
that
the
defendant
possessed
which
he
could
convert
to
cash
to
hire
a
lawyer
because
that's
what
this
case
entails.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
and
the
automobile
was
not
proposed
to
be
used
as
evidence.
its
sole
purpose
of
the
seizure
was
to
sell
it--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--and
penalize
the
defendant
for
having--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--i
believe
that
if
the
sole
purpose
is
to
maximize
the
forfeiture
penalty
and
not
for
evidence
or
some
other
thing
and
the
automobile
was
not
proven
to
be
used
in
the
crime
at
the
time
of
its
seizure
and
the
defendant
needs
to
sell
it
to
raise
counsel
fees,
that...
that
that
would,
in
fact,
be
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
to
counsel
of
choice
in
that
very
unusual
circumstance.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
what
is
unusual
is
the
notion
that
a
defendant's
only
asset
would
be
the
automobile.
that's
unusual.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
well,
the...
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
discretion
in
853
could
be
read
to
even
include
it
there.
it
is
a
more
difficult
case--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--because
it
is
not
a
blanket
asset
forfeiture;
it
is
a
particularized
one.
i
would
urge
that
the
court
would
have
discretion
in
that
case
as
well,
although
i
concede
it's
a
more
difficult
case.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
no,
justice
stevens,
i
wouldn't.
there
the
marked
bills,
among
other
things,
are
evidence.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
that's
correct,
from
the
beginning.
they
are
not
being
returned
as
a
penalty
for
the
crime
that
the
defendant
has
yet
to
be
convicted
of.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--no,
justice
kennedy,
but
this
is
not
an
unjust
enrichment
statute,
and
in
an
unjust
enrichment
case,
the
defendant
generally
speaking,
is
not
deprived
of
his
ability
to
live
and
hire
counsel
while
he
litigates
with
his
opponent
under
some
doctrine
of
relation
back
or
some
restraining
order.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
by
definition,
the
dope
dealer
or
the
rico
defendant
or
the...
in
the
future,
the
tax
evader
who
has
spent
the
money
on
a
lawyer
has
not
kept
it.
the
only
question
is
can
he
spend
it
on
a
lawyer
or
for
living
expenses
and
have
it
dissipated
that
way,
or
does
he
have
to
go
without
so
that
the
government
can
take
all
of
it
after
he
is
convicted.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
might.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
your
honor,
counsel
for
the
government
has
persistently
attempted
to
suggest
that
the
caplin
&
drysdale
case
is
unusual
because
the...
it
involves
a
situation
where
at
the
time
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
the
ability
to
pay
his
lawyer,
the
government
had
proven
or
had
a
high
degree
of
certainty
that
the
assets
were
forfeitable.
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
what
is
the
case
is
that
it
was
proven
after
the
services
were
rendered
that
the
assets
were
forfeitable
by
consent.
but
if
you...
if
you
posited
that
caplin
&
drysdale
had
been
paid
as
it
went
along,
because
there
was
no
restraining
order,
then
we
would
not
have
received
any
money
prior
to
the
time
of
the...
at
which
the
government
knew
to
be
forfeitable
or
the
court
knew
to
be
forfeitable.
but
under
853(c),
the
relation-back
doctrine,
the...
the
government
would
be
here
arguing
we
would
have
to
give
it
back.
the
question,
therefore,
is...
is...
is
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
caplin
&
drysdale,
as
part
of
its
ethical
obligation
to
its
client,
agreed
to
proceed
forward
and
represent
him
without
having
been
paid,
should
now
be
penalized
for
having
done
so
or,
alternatively,
should
have
given
into
a
conflict
of
interest
and
said
to
the
defendant
don't
plead
guilty
on
march
the
14th.
we've
got
a
hearing
on
march
15th
on
our
fees.
we
want
to
make
sure
we
get
paid
first.
and
maybe
the
government
will
withdraw
the
guilty
plea
offer
if
we
don't
take
it
today,
but
that's
not
really
very
important
because
it's
more
important
that
we
get
paid.
that
is,
it
seems
to
me,
an
extremely
harsh
and
unjustified
rule
to
try
and
single
out
caplin
&
drysdale
from
all
other
lawyers
that
could
come
in
here
and
make
an
argument--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--to
get
you
to
pay.
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
it
was
ordered
forfeited
because
a
person
with
no
economic--
mr.
peter
van
n.
lockwood
--yes,
sir.
