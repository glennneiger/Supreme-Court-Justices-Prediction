ms.

tankenson

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
that
is
certified
before
you
in
this
proceeding
is
whether
frazier
v.
heebe
prohibits
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands
from
requiring
residence
as
a
requisite
for
the
practice
of
law
in
the
virgin
islands.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
concluded
that
frazier
bound
the
court
of
appeals
to
strike
the
virgin
islands
rule
of
residency
and
to
exercise
its
supervisory
power
to
do
so.
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
court
of
appeals
was
of
the
view
that
it
need
not
consider
the
facts
surrounding
the
practice
of
law
in
the
virgin
islands,
but...
that
it
was
bound
to
treat
frazier
as
controlling
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
disallowing
rules
of
residence
for
any
district
court
under
its
jurisdiction,
which
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands
is.
but
the
virgin
islands,
and
the
court
system
in
the
virgin
islands,
are
unique;
and
the
factual
circumstances
surrounding
our
court
system,
we
feel
clearly
make
the
rule
that
has
been
enforced
in
the
virgin
islands
both
reasonable
and
necessary.
we
would
contend
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
failing
to
consider
whether
the
rule
of
residency
was
reasonable
and
necessary
in
the
context
of
the
practice
of
law
in
the
virgin
islands,
and
instead
in
applying
frazier
as
a
per
se
rule.
there
are
two
basic
reasons
why
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
view
is
in
error
in
its
application
of
frazier.
first,
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands
is
not
a
united
states
district
court.
it
is
a
court
created
by
congress,
but
it
is
a
court
in
which
congress
has
vested
the
judicial
power
of
the
virgin
islands.
the
court
has
also
been
given
the
jurisdiction
of
a
united
states
district
court,
but
its
status
and
its
role
are
quite
different
from
that
of
the
united
states
district
courts.
it
functions,
in
effect,
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
virgin
islands.
it
is
the
highest
insular
court
and
its
rules
of
practice
are,
by
rule,
the
rules
for
admission
to
the
virgin
islands
bar.
we
have
an
integrated
bar
association,
and
thus
when
one
is
admitted
by
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands
to
practice,
he
becomes
a
member
of
the
virgin
islands
bar
association.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
that's
correct,
judge.
our
district
court
functions
as
the
closest
equivalent
to
a
supreme
court
of
the
virgin
islands.
it
hears
the
appeals
from
the
territorial
court
system,
which
is
the
lowest
trial
court
system
in
the
virgin
islands
in
terms
of...
supervisory
authority.
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands
also
acts
as
a
court
of
original
jurisdiction
and
hears
civil
matters
where
the
amount
in
controversy
is
as
little
as
$500,
hears
criminal
matters
where
the
charge
is
a
felony
even
if
the
charge
does
not
arise
under
federal
law.
but
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands
also
functions
as
the
appellate
court
for
all
decisions
from
the
territorial
court.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
i
believe
that
that
is
the
correct
treatment,
at
least
to
this
extent,
justice
kennedy.
we
think
that
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands
must
be
considered
at
least
a
hybrid
court.
and
in
its
rulemaking
capacity,
when
it
is
fashioning
rules
for
practice,
since
those
rules
by
definition
govern
admission
to
the
virgin
islands
bar
as
a
whole,
we
think
the
proper
standard
to
apply
to
that
exercise
of
authority
is
at
least
the
standard
that
the
court
would
apply
to
a
supreme
court.
that
is
to
say
that
the
rule
should
not
be
struck
under
the
exercise
of
the
supervisory
power,
unless
the
rule
would
be
unconstitutional,
or
unless
it
would
be,
in
the
language
of
the
decisions
from
the
territories
that
we
have
referred
to,
inescapably
wrong
or
inescapably
improper.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
yes,
the
statute
does
apply
and
we
are
subject
to
the
privileges
and
immunities.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands
is
this
special
and
unique
hybrid
court,
the
virgin
islands
is
in
a
factual
setting
which
is
quite
unlike
any
that
have
reached
the
federal
courts
before,
either
under
frazier
or
under
the
several
other
cases
which
have
been
decided,
piper
v.
new
hampshire
and
friedman
v.
virginia.
the
facts
that
make
us
so
different
begin
with
our
geography.
we
are,
of
course,
at
least
1,000
miles
from
the
closest
part
of
the
continental
united
states,
and
this
creates
serious
concern
for
the
judicial
system.
it
means
that
a
practicing
lawyer
who
is
not
a
resident
of
the
virgin
islands
encounters
travel
difficulties
which
certainly
do
not
face
his
counterparts,
for
example,
who
live
in
neighboring
states
like
vermont
and
new
hampshire.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
i...
i
am
a
little
bit
hesitant
to
speak
of
the
circumstances
in
guam
since
that
is
not
an
area
with
which
i'm
deeply
familiar.
but
at
least
to
the
extent
that--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--yes,
justice
i--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--the
problems
in
guam
that
i'm
reluctant
to
comment
on
would
be
those
that
exceed
the
question
of
being
a
long
way
away
across
water.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
we
are
told...
we
are
told
that
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
frazier,
that
guam
has
rescinded
its
absolute
prohibition
on
non-resident
admissions
and
has
adopted
a
rule
which
requires
non-resident
lawyers
to
have
a
local
lawyer
with
whom
they
are
affiliated,
who
appears
with
them
in
all
proceedings
and
signs
all
pleadings
with
them.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
we
don't
think
that
it
would
work,
judge,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--i'm
sorry.
i
apologize,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
the
reason
that
we
don't
think
it
would
work
is
that
the
virgin
islands
has
a
set
of
circumstances
that
differ
from
those
of
other
jurisdictions
in
excess
of
our
geographic
isolation.
we
have,
as
we
have
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
the
highest
per
capita
crime
rate
in
the
united
states,
the
lowest
per
capita
income,
and
the
highest
number
of
cases
per
judgeship
in
our
courts,
in
our
federal
courts,
of
any
place
in
the
united
states
for
which
statistics
are
available.
a
consequence
of
that
is
that
we
have
been
required
to
develop
a
system
under
which
all
members
of
the
bar
are
required
to
share
the
duty
of
serving
in
effect
as
public
defenders.
that
is
not
a
system
that
seems
workable
with
non-residents.
they
could
not
respond
to
the
needs
of
a
defendant
who's
been
incarcerated
promptly
enough.
we
don't
even
feel
like
it
would
be
[inaudible].
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
there
would
be
at
least
one
immediate
problem
with
a
system
of
that
sort,
and
that
is
that
it
would
clearly
establish
a
kind
of
two-class
system
for
the
practice
of
law.
the
virgin
islands
has,
i
think,
developed
a
quite
delicate
social
fabric
in
which
it
is
extremely
important
that
virgin
islanders
know
and
believe
that
people
who
come
to
the
islands
from
the
united
states
do
not
come
equipped
with
a
set
of
special
rights
which
allows
them
to
have
preference
in
the
way
they
conduct
themselves.
and
if
we
had
a
system
where
non-residents
were
admitted
to
the
bar,
but
were
not
required
to
function
as
the
local
lawyers
do
in
taking
their
full
share
of
criminal
appointments,
if
they
could
in
effect
hire
a
mercenary
substitute
for
themselves,
i
think
there
would
be
damage
to
the
system
that
the
district
court
has
devised
for
requiring
all
lawyers
to
fulfill
their
share
of
responsibility
equally.
also,
we
don't
know
that
the
system
in
guam
is
working.
it's
quite
a
recent
innovation
in
response
to
what
that
court
apparently
believed
was
its
obligations
under
this
court's
decision
in
frazier,
and
we
have
absolutely
no
evidence
on
this
record
that
they
are
not
encountering
difficulties
with
it.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
the
only
distinction
that
i
am
aware
that's
been
recognized
in
the
decisions
between
admission
of
nearby
residents
and
very
distant
residents
is,
number
one,
that
the
cases
have
said
that
they
think
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
the
vast
majority
of
applicants
for
admission
to
a
bar
in
a
state
in
which
they
do
not
reside
will
be
nearby
residents.
obviously
that
presumption
doesn't
apply
to
the
virgin
islands.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
actually,
if
i
may
say
so,
the
court
did
say
that
a
different
rule
could
apply
to
distant
residents.
what
it
said
was
that
in
the
case
of
distant
residents
the
lawyer
could
be
required
to
have
local
counsel
retained.
that
is
recognized
both
in
frazier
and
in
piper.
the,
the
concern
that
we
have
is
that
if
the
only
problem
with
admission
to
the
virgin
islands
bar
were
distance,
if
we
only
needed
somebody
to
occasionally
answer
a
motion
call
on
short
notice,
aside
from
the
district
court's
concern
that
in
most
cases
when
that
local
lawyer
appears
in
pro
hac
vice
cases
he
answers,
not
ready,
judge,
i
didn't
know
this
case.
but
putting
that
concern
aside,
we
have
the
complicated
situation
that
it
is,
in
the
case
of
the
virgin
islands,
not
merely
distance,
but
distance
complicated
with
a
transportation
system
that's
very
limited.
we
as
a
destination
are
a
tiny
island.
we
don't
have
the
kind
of
commercial
transportation
facilities
that
exist
for
the
cross-country
commuters
between,
say,
california
and
new
york.
we
have
a
limited
number
of
airlines
serving
us,
we
have
very
high
tourist
travel.
and
the
district
court
said
in
its
decision,
it
clearly
did
not
feel
that
ready
access
to
transportation
was
available
to
the
virgin
islands.
the
other
thing
that
the
court
said,
justice
scalia,
in
both
frazier
and
piper,
was
that
perhaps
there
need
not
be
quite
so
much
concern
about
distance
alone,
since
it
was
becoming
increasingly
common
to
use
telephone
conferences
as
a
substitute
for
in-person
appearances
in
some
of
the
courts.
in
the
virgin
islands,
as
the
district
court
has
pointed
out,
however,
that
is
not
a
ready
substitute,
since
our
telephone
service
is
not
reliable.
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
telephone
service
to
the
virgin
islands
is
subject
to
problems
with
transmission,
echoes,
loss
of
connections,
and
so
on.
and,
therefore,
the
court
could
not
rely
on
telephone
conferences
in
the
virgin
islands
as
a
ready
substitute.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
the
name
of
our
telephone
company
is
the
virgin
islands
telephone
company,
justice.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
it
is
a
single
company,
it
has
an
exclusive
franchise,
and
there
have
been
problems
reported--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--i,
i
[inaudible].
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
it,
it
is
certainly
not
a
system
that
is
a
total
failure,
justice
stephens.
it
does
function.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
we
are
able
to
call
the
united
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
court
said
that
service
has
improved
over
the
last
ten
years.
but
it
has
not
improved
to
the
point
at
which
the
court
is
comfortable
relying
on
telephone
conferences
as
a
substitute
for
an
attorney's
presence,
because
the
court,
as
we've
pointed
out,
has
a
really
unusual
judicial
burden.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
well
that...
it
might
be
alleviated
if
we
had
more
lawyers
who
were
actually
there,
judge...
justice,
excuse
me,
justice
stephens.
but
it
cannot
be--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--i
do,
do
apologize.
but
it
is
not
alleviated,
if
you
have
attorneys
of
record
on
cases
for
whom
the
court
must
wait,
who
are
not
there,
who
call
and
say
i
can't
arrive,
or
who
don't
call
and
say
i
can't
arrive--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--yes.
we
have
pro
hac
vice
admissions
under
our
rules.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
it
is
relatively
common.
they
are
required
to
have
a
local
attorney
with
them
on
the
pleadings
and
in
their
court
appearances.
but--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--well,
the,
the
court
has
said
two
things
about
that
judge.
number
one...
justice...
it
has
said...
i'm
going
to
stop
addressing
people.
number
one,
the
court
has
said--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--thank
you.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
thank
you.
i
believe
when
the
recess
was
announced
i
was
asked
about
the
significance
of
the
virgin
islands
experience
with
pro
hac
vice
admissions.
and
it
seemed
to
be
suggested
in
the
question
that
if
the
territory
has
been
able
to
accommodate
pro
hac
vice
admissions
that
it
would
follow
that
we
probably
could
accommodate
full-pledged
admission
of
non-residents,
so
long
as
they
were
required
to
associate
themselves
with
local
counsel.
the
primary
difference,
however,
between
those
two
categories
of
admission
in
our
territory
is
that
all
active
members
of
the
bar
are
required
to
fulfill
their
responsibility
under
rule
16
to
serve
as,
in
effect,
federal
public
defenders,
also
territorial
public
defenders,
and
also
to
accept
appointments
at
the
territorial
court
level
to
represent
indigents
in
family
matters.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
there
is
not
a
statement
in
the
written
rule,
but
there
is
a
well-established
judicial
authority
to
the
effect
that
each
lawyer
in
the
virgin
islands
must
accept
his
appointments
on
an
individual
basis,
and
his
failure
to
do
so
can
result
in
his
loss
of
entitlement
to
be
an
active
practitioner
in
the
virgin
islands.
the
district
court
specifically
adverted
to
that
in
its
decision
below.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
that
is
correct.
and
indeed--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--the
only
way
that
an
attorney
can
be
excused
from
the
obligation
to
accept
an
appointment
is
by
petitioning
the
court
and
making
a
showing
that
he
is
not
qualified
in
his
view
to
handle
a
particular
matter.
and
the
court
then
has
the
discretion
to
make
a
substitute
appointment.
he
will
then
take
another
appointment
at
a
subsequent
time.
but
it
is
not
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
to
find
a
substitute
for
himself.
it
is
an
individual
and
personal
obligation
under
our
system
of
appointments.
and
as
a
policy--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--it
is
justified
by
the
courts
of
the
virgin
islands
as
being
necessary
to
have
a
smooth,
functioning
equitable
system.
the
system
is
designed
to
ensure
that
all
members
of
the
bar,
not
only
the
newcomers
recently
admitted,
but
the
well-established,
expensive,
sought-after
lawyers,
take
their
share
of
the
appointments,
and
that
an
indigent--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--well,
it's
quite
unlikely
that
a
tax
attorney
would
not,
if
he
petitioned
for
substitution,
be
permitted
to
have
a
different
appointment.
but
it
is
entirely
unlikely,
indeed
it's
unheard
of
in
the
virgin
islands--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--well,
there
are
many
kinds
of
cases
for
which
we're
appointed,
there
are
immigration
cases.
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
is
both
a
federal
and
a
local
court
in
its
jurisdiction.
so
it
does
not
hear
only
the
most
terrible
felonies,
it
hears
all
matters
of
criminal
cases,
and
needs
appointments
in
all
those
matters.
it
has
tax
cases
in
which
appointments
must
be
made.
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
however,
is
twofold.
it
ensures
that
the
system
has
attorneys
for
indigent
defendants,
that
they
are
given
adequate
counsel,
and
it
ensures
that
each
member
of
the
bar
contributes
his
fair
share
of
his
time
to
that
endeavor.
it
is
thought
to
be
a
system
that
is
fair
to
all
lawyers,
but
in
effect
taxes
them
all
equally.
we
all
pay
our
taxes
on
our
income
in
the
virgin
islands,
lawyers
pay
a
tax
on
our
time
as
well.
it
is
an
obligation
of
all
active
members
of
the
bar,
and
we
would
understand
this
court's
decisions
to
require
that
if
a
non-resident
wanted
to
be
admitted
he
would
be
expected
to
carry
an
equal
share
with
any
other
admitted
lawyers
of
those
duties.
the
problem
is
that
it
seems
clear
to
the
district
court
at
least
that
the
non-resident
lawyer
could
not
do
so,
and
that
he
would
inevitably
be
put
in
the
position
of
wanting
to
hire
a
substitute
for
himself,
and
that
that
would
inevitably
create
a
system
in
which
there
were
a
hired
bar
that
replaced
the
non-residents,
in
effect
a
two-class
system,
which
the
district
court
thought
not
acceptable.
ms.
maria

the
affidavit--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--can
i
just
clarify
and
say,
all
lawyers
take
an
equal
number
of
appointments.
whether
they
want
them
or
not,
they
all
take
an
equal
number.
it's
not
whether
they
like
them
or
not,
they
all
get
them.
it
rotates.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
the
affidavits
below
suggest
that
as
of
the
date
of
the
evidentiary
record
here,
approximately
four
appointments
a
year
was
considered
average.
that
does
not
include
appointments
in
the
family
court
to
represent
parents
and
children
in
cases
of
dissolution
and--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--actually
it
would
be
unfair
if
he
took
any
lesser
number
of
appointments.
but
it's
our
view
that
if
a
non-resident
were
admitted
to
active
membership
in
the
virgin
islands
bar
what
would
actually
happen
is
he
would
not
be
able
to
effectively
take
any,
because
he
might--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--the
local
lawyers,
the
virgin
islands
lawyer
would
then
be
a
disadvantaged
group.
they
would...
number
one,
they
would
probably
take
more
appointments
than
they
would
have
otherwise--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--but
in,
in
addition
to
having
to
take
more,
they
would
in
effect
be--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--it
seems
to
us,
a
second-class
bar.
the
non-residents
could
come
in
only
to
handle
the
highly-paid
cases.
the
resident
bar
would
be
the
bar
that
would
represent
all
the
criminal
defendants.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
we
do
not
want
to
relive
that
experience.
we
very
much
want
to
keep
a
system
in
which
there
is
an
equitable
distribution
of
the
responsibility.
the
very
successful
and
affluent
lawyer
in
the
virgin
islands
comes
to
court
and
stands
next
to
the
beginner
and
takes
his
share
of
the
appointments.
and
we
think
that--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--the
district
court's
decision
below
indicated
that
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
judge
that
if
the
rule
were
evenly
applied
to
all
that
the
non-residents
would
inevitably
fail
in
their
effort
to
comply,
no
matter
how
well
intentioned
they
were.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
well,
it
would
be
possible
to
try
the
experience,
but
the
difficulty
would
be--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--in
the...
yes,
they
excluded
from
practice
if
they
don't
take
their
appointments.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
yes.
the
problem
would
be
that
in
the
experimental
period--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--i
don't
know.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
it's
not
in
the
record.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
it
is
not
in
the
record,
and
i
don't
know.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
it
doesn't
happen
very
often
because
lawyers
wouldn't
have
the
nerve
to
refuse
appointments.
to
complete
the
thought,
if
we
had
an
experimental
period,
and
we
said,
we'll
let
the
non-residents
in,
we'll
say
you
must
take
your
equal
share
of
appointments
like
everyone
else,
and
if
you
fail
to
appear
on
time
we
will
disbar
you,
there
will
certainly
be
a
risky
period
when
criminal
defendants
who
are
relying
on
those
persons
who
have
been
appointed
who
are
not
there
may
have
inadequate
representation.
their
lawyer
may
not
be
there
on
time
to
make
a
bail
motion
for
them,
he
may
miss
a
witness
who
couldn't
be
found
because
he
didn't
interview
the
person
in
custody
quickly
enough.
so
it's
a
risky
experiment.
and
it's
also
risky
for
the
courts,
which
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
are
working
with
an
extraordinary
case
load,
disproportionate,
we
feel,
to
all
other
courts
in
a
comparable
situation.
and
the
court
itself
in
that
setting
has
said,
as
the
jurist
best
able
to
examine
the
setting
of
this
court,
the
setting
in
the
virgin
islands,
the
demand
for
judicial
efficiency,
i,
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court
say,
it
would
be
intolerable
for
me
to
try
to
keep
this
system
working
if
i
had
to
deal
with
non-residents
who
fail
to
appear,
who
didn't
get
their
notice
of
hearings
on
time
because
the
mail
didn't
reach
them,
or
their
pleading
didn't
get
back
to
me.
and
it,
it
seems
to
us
quite
difficult
for
this
court,
even
in
a
conscientious
effort
to
apply
the
principles
of
the
cases
that
have
been
cited,
to
try
to
determine
whether
that
rule
is
reasonable
in
the
virgin
islands.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
i,
i--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
said
it
need
not
reach
the
facts,
and
when
it
said
it
took
a
different
view
of
the
facts
i
think
it
meant
it
took
a
different
view
of
the
significance
of
the
factual
dispute,
because
the
opinion
of
the
majority
says,
we
need
not
even
decide
which
of
the
two
contradictory
affidavits
are
correct.
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
with
whether
travel
to
the
islands
is
difficult,
with
whether
telephone
communications
are
adequate.
we
simply
see
ourselves
as
bound
by
the
decision
in
frazier,
because
the
goals
that
the
virgin
islands
has
said
it
is
trying
to
achieve
are
similar
to
the
goals
that
were
mentioned
by
the
state
in
frazier
and
piper.
so
the
court
of
appeals
chose
not
to
look
at
the
facts.
it
specifically
says
in
its
decision,
we
need
not
consider
these
factual
disputes,
we
don't
think
they're
materials.
we're
simply
bound
by
the
outcome
in
frazier.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
at
the
very
outset
of
the
opinion.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
majority
opinion.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
it
is
our
contention
that,
while
the
third
circuit
has
supervisory
power
over
the
virgin
islands,
that
it
was
incorrect
in
exercising
it
to
strike
this
rule.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
no,
we
conceded
to
the
third
circuit
that
they
had
supervisory
power
over
the
virgin
islands
in
our
brief,
but
contended
that
it
should
be
exercised
with
a
great
degree
of
deference
toward
the
virgin
islands
as
a
territorial
court,
and
also
that
our
factual
setting
was
so
different
from
that
which
was
before
the
court
in
frazier
that
it
was
not
correct
to
apply
the
supervisory
power
to
strike
our
rule,
relying
upon
that
precedent.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
that's
correct.
it
did
not.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
it
could
be
read
to
mean
that
the
facts
were
not
material,
but
since
they
were
all
the
facts
that
had
to
do
with
access
and
availability,
presumably
the
significance
of
that
was
to
say,
even
if
a
lawyer
will
have
problems
of
availability,
that
is
not
material
to
the
question
of
whether
the
supervisory
power
should
be
used.
the,
the
points
that
were
in
dispute
in
the
two
affidavits
were
how
closely
travel
access
to
the
virgin
islands
approximated
travel
in
other
locations,
how
good
telephone
service
had
become--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--i'm
sorry,
sir.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
puerto
rico
is
approximately
40
miles
from
the
closest
part
of
the
virgin
islands.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
no,
we
don't.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
none
at
all.
and
it...
and
it
would
not,
in
our
view,
be
useful
to
too
closely
analogize
puerto
rico
and
the
virgin
islands
to
the
states
which
have
contiguous
borders,
because
while
there
is
a
relatively
short
number
of
miles
between
us,
puerto
rico
is
within
and
we
are
without
the
united
states
customs
zone.
so
when
one
travels
from
the
virgin
islands
to
puerto
rico,
he
crosses
customs,
he
crosses
immigration,
he
must
establish
his
citizenship,
he's
subject
to
border
searches,
and
of
course
he's
entering
a
commonwealth
in
which
the
language
of
the
majority
is
spanish,
the
law
schools
teach
the
law
in
spanish,
the
laws
are
written
in
spanish
and
the
courts
are
conducted
in
spanish
except
for
the
federal
court.
so
our
proximity
is--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--there
is
some
parallel
in
the
sense
that
alaska
is
quite
distant
from
the
rest
of
the
contiguous
united
states.
but
there
is
also
the
distinction
that
alaska
has
such
a
large
land
mass
of
its
own
that
when
it
compares
a
residency
requirement
with...
with
our
setting
they
have
many
lawyers,
as
the
court
there
has
pointed
out,
within
the
state
who
live
further
from
a
particular
courthouse
than
do
lawyers
residing,
for
example,
in
the
state
of
washington.
we
have
no
companion
situation
to
that.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
the
position
we
have
taken
is
that
the
durational
residency
requirement
can
only
stand
if
the
simple
residency
requirement
is
first
found
to
be
valid.
and
if
the
simple
residency
requirement
is
valid,
then
the
durational
residency
requirement
is
clearly
subject
to
a
different
kind
of
attack.
but
we
believe
that
these
petitioners
do
not
have
standing
to
make
that
challenge,
if
the
simple
residency
requirement
is
sustained.
we
have
conceded
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
do
again
before
this
court,
that
the
durational
residency
requirement
is
certainly
more
difficult
to
defend
and
is
not
addressed
at
the
same
concerns
that
support
the
simple
residency
requirement.
i'd
reserve
any
minutes
that
i
may
have,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
thank
you.
the
reasons
that
the
virgin
islands
rule
of
residence
is
broadly
applicable,
not
only
to
litigators,
is
that
all
lawyers
who
practice
in
the
virgin
islands
are
by
definition
litigators,
since
all
lawyers
take
their
share
of
appointments
and
therefore,
whether
they
might
have
fashioned
themselves
a
specialty
that
didn't
include
any
litigation
or
not,
in
fact
we
all
are
litigators,
as
least
part
time.
our
rule
is
criticized
as
being
somehow
broader
than
the
rule
at
issue
in
piper
because
it
applies
and
requires
not
only
that
you
live
in
the
jurisdiction
at
the
time
you're
admitted
but
that
you
continue
to
live
there
throughout
the
duration
of
your
active
practice.
but
it's
my
understanding
that
in
the
former
opinions
the
states
have
been
criticized
for
having
rules
that
only
require
you
to
be
a
resident
at
the
time
of
your
admission
and
allowed
you
to
then
surrender
your
residency
but
keep
your
active
practice.
in
the
virgin
islands,
once
admitted,
if
you
move
away
from
the
territory
you
become
an
inactive
member
of
the
bar.
you
do
not
remain
active
because
the
court
holds
the
view
that
you
cannot
fulfill
your
responsibilities
to
the
court
to
be
present
when
needed,
to
remain
informed
on
virgin
island
law,
and
to
fulfill
your
responsibilities
if
you
don't
live
in
the
territory.
it
is
not
the
case,
and
we've
made
this
point
before
but
i
felt
the
need
to
repeat
it
in
response
to
the
argument,
that
the
virgin
islands
contends
that
applicants
for
admission
before
you
are
not,
or
at
least
were
not
at
the
time
they
passed
the
virgin
islands
bar,
competent
lawyers.
but
in
terms
of
competency
there
is
a
concern
of
the
virgin
islands
that
wasn't
mentioned
in
earlier
arguments,
and
that
is
that
unlike
the
law
of
new
hampshire
or
the
law
of
virginia
or
the
law
of
louisiana,
our
law
is
not
readily
of
disseminated
across
the
united
states.
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
the
virgin
islands
for
the
most
part,
for
at
least
a
year
and
a
half,
are
available
only
in
the
district
court
libraries,
and
photocopies,
so
the
resident
bar
that
has
to
go
the
district
court
library
and
use
an
index
system
to
do
their
research
on
current
decisions.
the
same
is
true
of
statutes
passed
by
the
virgin
islands
legislature.
none
of
the
major
publication
systems
of
legal
research
include
virgin
islands
reference
materials.
we're
not
in
westlaw,
we're
not
in
lexis,
we're
simply
just
not
available
across
the
country.
and
the
view
of
a
nationwide
bar
that
can
readily
cross
the
boundaries
of
the
state
and
provide
specialized
service
to
clients
may
be
a
very
good
view.
but
it
does
not
necessarily
apply
to
a
small
territory
whose
laws
are
unique
to
itself.
we're
not,
as
you
know,
covered
by
every
federal
statute.
we're
not
even
covered
by
every
provision
of
the
constitution.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
yes.
quite
different
views.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
yes,
they
were.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
the
district
court,
i
think,
in,
in
candor,
felt
that
it
knew
the
facts
so
well
that
it
was
in
a
position
to,
in
effect,
take
judicial
notice
of
the
correct
version
of
the
facts.
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
i
quite
agree,
and
it
was
suggested
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
perhaps
the
more
correct
remedy
would
be
to
remand
for
a
trial
to
decide
the
factual
disputes.
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
do
that
and
simply
held--
ms.
maria
tankenson
hodge
--the
court
of
appeals
evidently
shared
mr.
hitchcock's
view
that
once
frazier
was
decided
it
need
not
concern
itself
with
the
special
difficulties
associated
with
practicing
in
a
jurisdiction,
that
those
concerns
of
the
virgin
islands
had
been
eliminated
from
legitimate
consideration
by
the
court's
decision.
