justice
byron
r.
white
well,
ms.
hodge,
the...
as
i
take
it,
the
court
of
appeals...
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
we
disagree
with
appellant's
assertion
that
the
facts
in
this
case
dictate
a
different
result
than
the
result
reached
in
heebe.
now,
it
didn't
spell
that
out,
but
it
must
have
disagreed
with,
with
you
and
disagreed
with
the
dissent
who
made
the
very
points
you're
making.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
court
perhaps
knows
more
about...
i'm
sure
it
doesn't
know
more
about
the
virgin
islands
than
you
do,
but
it,
it
certainly
knows
more
about
the
virgin
islands
than
we
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
opinion--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
the
way,
while
i've
got
you
interrupted,
you,
you
no
longer
urge,
i
take
it,
that,
that,
that
the
very
exercise
of
supervisory
power
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
didn't
you
urge
below
that
they
shouldn't
do
it...
that,
that
they
were...
had
no
power
to
do
it
on
these
supervisory
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
said
it
was...
that
the
disagreement
was
not
an
issue
of
material
fact,
so
the
disagreement
was
just
those
facts
were
not
material,
they
thought.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
by
declaring
this
rule
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
that
would
just
arguing
over
breadth,
which
i'm
not
sure
is
applicable
in
cases
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
maybe
as
applied
to
some
puerto
rican
it
would
be
invalid,
but
i
don't
know
that
you've
got
much
to
do
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you...
are
you
defending
the,
not
only
the
result
but
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
facts
are
just
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
do
you
think...
you,
you
apparently
agree
then
that
the
differences
in
views
about
transportation
and
communications,
need,
need
not
be
decided
in
resolving
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
to
put
it
another
way,
do
you
think
that
the
availability
of
communications
and
transportation
is
a
relevant
consideration
in
things
like
this
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
this
case
as
far
as
you're
concerned
if
the
only
way
to
get
to
the
virgin
islands
from
the
united
states
was
in
a
rowboat?
justice
byron
r.
white
pretty
peculiar--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
that...
is
that
a
fair
reading
of
piper?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so.
so
by...
that
doesn't
say
that,
if
he
lives
a
great
distance
and,
and
there's
no
way
of
his
getting
here
inside
of
a
week,
that's
irrelevant.
it
didn't
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say,
you
say
this
evidence
is
relevant,
it's
just
that
it...
it
isn't
meaningful
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
put
the
evidence
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
addressed
to
the
air
and
communications
services?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it
you
think
the
district
court
was
certainly
but
of
bounds
in,
in
making
these
factual
observations
without
a
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
was
on
a
summary
judgment.
and
there
were...
certainly
the
affidavits
posed
triable
issues
of
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
it
was,
there
was
a
counter-affidavit
that
denied
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
offer
services
from
the
continental
united
states
to
residents
of
puerto
rico,
or
residents
of
virgin
islands.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
that
you
and
your
opponent
have
a
different
views
of
the
facts
with
respect
to
communications
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
did
the...
did
the...
and
those
different
views
were
reflected
in
the
counter-affidavits
that
were
filed--
justice
byron
r.
white
--wells
what...
how
come
it
wasn't
at
trial
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
strange
way
of
proceeding
for
summary
judgment--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
just
didn't
seem
to
think
they,
it
made
much
difference.
