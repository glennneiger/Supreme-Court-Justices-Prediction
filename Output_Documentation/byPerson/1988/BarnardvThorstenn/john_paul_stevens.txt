you
know,
you
can
talk
to
paris,
you
can
talk
to
tokyo,
but
you
can't
talk
to
the
virgin
islands--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--maybe
you...
maybe
you
ought
to
get
a
new
system,
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
seems
to
me
that
burden
would...
might
be
alleviated
somewhat
if
you
had
more
lawyers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your,
your
mistake
in
calling
me
judge
is
also
made
in
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
by
the
way.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
do
with
pro
hac
vice
admissions?
do
they
let
them
come
in,
or
do
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
it
fairly
common?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
you
couldn't
do
the
same
thing
with
these
people.
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many...
how
many
cases
are
we
talking
about
for
the
average
member
of
the...
how
many
appointed
cases--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--does
the
tax...
the
one
who
gets
the
least,
the
tax
lawyer
who
really
doesn't
want
to
get
involved
in
criminal
law
at
all,
how
many
appointments
will
he
typically
take
a
year?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
i'm
asking
about,
you
know,
the
most--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
your,
your
point
is
that
if
a
non-resident
lawyer
could
only
handle
three,
that'd
be
unfair
to
those
who
handle
four,
and
therefore
you
should
have
the
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
might
have
to
hire
somebody
else
who
then
would
take
four
by
appointment
and
four
by
being
hired,
that's
a
total
of
eight,
say,
and
that
would
be
unfair
to
the
other
members
of
the
bar
because...
for
what
reason
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
get
paid
for
the
four
that
the
non-resident
is
willing
to
hire
somebody
to
handle.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they'd
take
their
four.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
they
let
the
non-residents
in
on
condition,
say,
it's
kind
of
inconvenient
but
you
must
take
your
four
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
don't
you
say,
then
you
get
disbarred
if
you
fail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
disbar
them
now
if
they
don't
take
their
four?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
have
there
been
such
disbarments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
lawyers
have
been
disbarred
for
that
reason?
does
the
record
tell
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it...
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
not
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
doubt
if
it
happens
very
often,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
respect
to
your
response
to
the
question
i
asked,
ms.
hodge
said
though
there
have
been
lawyers
disbarred
for
this
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
you
say
she
meant,
might
have
meant
just
to
say
excluded
from
trial
practice
in
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
gather
your
client
would
probably
be
delighted
to
be
excluded
from
that,
if
he
doesn't
want
to
take
these
cases.
but
this
rule
not
only
applies
to
people
who
want
to
go
to
court,
but
it
applies
to
anybody
who
just
wants
to
practice
law
in
the
virgin
islands,
doesn't
it?
