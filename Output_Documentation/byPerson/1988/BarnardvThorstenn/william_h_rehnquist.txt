we'll
near
argument
next
in
no.
87-1939,
geoffrey
w.
barnard
v.
susan
esposito
thorstenn
and
virgin
islands
bar
association
v.
thorstenn.
ms.
hodge,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
nothing
in
the
virgin
islands
judicial
system,
like
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico,
that
sits
side
by
side
with
the
federal
district
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll,
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
ms.
hodge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume,
ms.
hodge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
want
to
go
through
our
civil
war
experience
again.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
following
up
on
one
of
justice
white's
earlier
questions,
i
take
it
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
set
aside
any
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
court
as
being
clearly
erroneous?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
hodge.
mr.
hitchcock?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
guam
do
it
after
this
court's
frazier
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
would
be
the
relevant
court
for
our...
for
purposes
of
our
inquiry?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'd
like
to
get
back,
if
i
could,
to
my
question
about
guam.
i'm
not
sure
you
fully
understood
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
superior
court
they
do
have
a
restriction,
or
they
did
have
similar
to
that
imposed
by
the
virgin
islands?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
a
fair
inference
the
superior
court
did
it
not
because
it
wanted
to
but
because
it
thought
it
was
required
to
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
fair
to
say
the
superior
court
doesn't
see
the
need
for
these
restrictions,
when
they
had
then
but
changed
them
only
in
response
to
our
piper
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
an
accurate
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
doesn't
entitle
a
court
of
appeals
to
redo
facts
found
by
the
district
court,
or
to
decide
the
thing
without
any
factual
findings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
follow
the
procedural
aspect
one
more
time.
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
granted
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
petitioners.
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
in
effect
said,
your
client
should
have
gotten
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
means
that
the
affidavits
favorable
to
the
petitioners
have
to
be
considered
as
true.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
business
finding
any
facts
at
all,
if
it's...
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
each
one
is
a
question
of
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
say
the...
you
have
to
say
the
affidavits
raise,
raise
no
triable
issue
of
fact
and
that
your
clients
were
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
to
do
what
the
third
circuit
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
again,
that
isn't
what
the
third
circuit
went
off
on
at
all,
the
anderson
or
celotex
or
something
like
that
that
one
party's
affidavits
in
support
of
the
motion
were
adequate,
the
others
weren't.
the
third
circuit
just
treated
it
as
if
it
were
finding
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
that's
got
to
be
on
the
basis
that
communications
difficulties,
transportation
difficulties,
simply
don't
matter,
as
you
say
under
piper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hitchcock.
ms.
hodge,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hodge.
the
case
is
submitted.
