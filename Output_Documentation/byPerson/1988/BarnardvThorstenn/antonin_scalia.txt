justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
have
our
cases
drawn
any
distinction
as,
as
far
as
what
the
states
must
do
between
what
they
must
do
for
residents
of
neighboring
states
as
opposed
to
states
on
the
other
side
of
the
country?
i
mean,
i,
i
think
it's
further
from...
california
to
maine
that
it
is
from
florida
to
the
virgin
islands.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
didn't
say
that
you
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
have
to
apply
the
same
rule
to,
to
distant
residents,
if
they...
if
they
want
to
benefit
from
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
provides
the
telephone...
who
provides
the
telephone
service?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
it
doesn't
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it
may
have
been
more
cost-free
for
the
courts
of
guam
to
do
it.
i
don't
know
that
a
lot
of
lawyers
are
clamoring
to
practice
in
guam.
i
would
think
that
the
virgin-islands
is
a
much
more
amenable
place
to
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
only
point
is
i'm
not
sure
the
disincentives
are
equivalent
in
the
guam
courts
and
the
virgin
islands
courts.
the
language
difficulties
may,
may
not
be
equivalent.
guam
is
further
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
english
is
not
required
to
be
used
in
the
territorial
courts,
but
spanish
may
be
used
if
litigants
want
to
use
it.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
in
the
virgin
islands.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
have
misunderstood
ms.
hodge.
i
though
she
said
something
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
that...
those
problems
are
problems
for
the
mainland
jurisdictions
to
considered.
i,
i
suppose
if
we
had
before
us
a
case
where
maine
tried
to
exclude
from
practice
lawyers
who
were
admitted
only
in
the
virgin
islands,
then,
then
we
might
have
to
confront
that
problem.
i
guess
the
state
of
maine
could
well
come
in
and
say,
in
light
of
the
terrible
plane
service
and
telecommunications
with
the
virgin
islands,
though
we're
willing
to
let
people
here
from
all
other
states
and
territories,
not
from
the
virgin
islands.
