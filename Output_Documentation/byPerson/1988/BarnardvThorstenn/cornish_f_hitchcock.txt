mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
validity...
of
certain
residency
requirements
for
members
in
the
bar
of
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands.
and
before
discussing
why
we
believe
this
restrictions
are
invalid,
i
think
it's
useful
to
point
out
what
non-residents
would
have
to
do
as
a
practical
matter
to
be
licensed
there.
and
i
think
it'll
show
that
here,
as
in
piper,
frazier,
and
friedman,
lawyers
are
not
likely
to
seek
membership
unless
they
anticipate
a
regular
and
substantial
practice
in
the
virgin
islands,
and
that
these
factors
make
it
likely
they
will
satisfy
the
professional
obligations
to
the
same
extent
as
non-residents.
an
applicant
must
take
a
two-day
bar
exam
in
the
virgin
islands
in
july,
and
even
experienced
lawyers
must
take
it.
there's
no
way
of
waiving
in,
as
was
the
case
in
friedman.
there's
no
review
course,
so
a
lawyer
must
travel
to
the
virgin
islands
in
order
to
study
recent
decisions,
statutes,
and
become
abreast
of
developments
in
the
law.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
yes.
our
clients
have
taken
and
passed
the
bar
examination,
the
character
examination.
they
have
done
everything
that
is
required
of
members
of
the
bar
except
make
the
commitment
to
live
there.
they
are
willing
to...
they've
done
these
things.
they
are
willing
to
pay
the
$600
a
year
in
addition
to
bar
membership
obligations
elsewhere.
they
have
retained
a
partnership
arrangement
with
an
attorney
in
the
virgin
islands,
they've
staffed
the
office,
they
have
fax
machines,
telephone
machines.
and
they
also
have
clients
who
are
willing
to
retain
their
services
because
of
their
particular
expertise,
which
they
do
not
believe
they
can
obtain
simply
with
island
attorneys.
not
that
island
attorneys
are
not
competent,
but
it's
specialty,
a
synergy,
that
they
think
can
be
provided.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
they
will
meet
any
obligations
that
are
imposed
on
island
residents
in
an
even-handed
and
non-discriminatory
manner.
and
what
i
say
by
that,
if
there
are
exceptions
that
are
made
for
island
residents,
they
would
like
to
have
the
same
exceptions
that
are
made
there.
and,
and
i
think
that
is
sufficient
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
let
me
answer
that
in
this
manner.
again,
i
think
we
have
to
parse
it
in
terms
of
what
ms.
hodge
said.
the
four
appointments
are
not
all
in
the
district
court.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
at
note
seven,
there
is
at
most
one
appointment
a
year
in
the
district
courts,
and
only
the
district
court
has
this
no-substitutions
preference.
the
other
three
of
so
on
an
average
occur
in
the
territorial
court,
a
trial
court
of
limited
jurisdiction,
where
there
is
not
this
type
of
practice.
there
may
be
generally
four
cases
on
an
average,
but
lawyers
in
the
virgin
islands,
in
the
territorial
court,
can
send
down
an
associate,
can
ask
someone
to
substitute
for
them,
and
the
system
works.
it
is
only
in
the
district
court
that
you
have
this
preference.
and
to
the
extent,
as
ms.
hodge
indicated,
there
is
flexibility
in
that
system.
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
here.
the
briefs
suggest
that
the
no-substitutions
practice
is
administered
in
a
very
rigid
manner,
that
if
one
is
recovering
from
open-heart
surgery,
or
in
depositions
in
the
mainland,
or
travelling
in
europe,
that
there
are
no
exceptions
made.
but
i
think
ms.
hodge's
answer
to
your
question
earlier
today,
justice
kennedy,
suggested
that
it
is
more
flexible
and,
to
the
extent
there
is
exceptions
made,
the
respondents
may
ask
in
appropriate
circumstances.
but
they're
willing
to
do
whatever
is
obliged,
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
no-substitutions
practice
applies
only
to
the
extent
that
they
are
called
to
act
in
district
court
cases.
there
are
several
factors
that
were
alluded
to
in
ms.
hodge's
argument
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
which
suggest
that
this
rule
is
not
as
carefully
tailored
to
survive
scrutiny
under
piper
or
under
frazier.
first
of
all,
as
justice
blackmun's
question
pointed
out,
the
rule
applies
not
simply
to
mainlanders
but
to
lawyers
in
puerto
rico
who
are
only
40
miles
away,
and
there
are
six
airlines
flying
between
puerto
rico
and
the
virgin
islands
on
a
daily
basis.
it's
one
of
the
best-served
markets
in
terms
of
the
frequency
of
flights.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
think
that
it
diminishes
the
argument.
if
there
were
less
service
i
would
still
make
the
same--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
the
court
has
indicated
in
looking
whether--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
i
think
that
the
court
has
looked
in
privileges
and
immunities
clause
cases
in
terms
of
whether
the
restriction
is
over-inclusive
or
under-inclusive.
and
i
think
that
as
part
of
that
analysis,
it's,
it's
useful.
but
i'd
point
out
also,
not
only...
apart
from
puerto
rico
there
are
a
number
of
other
jurisdictions
which
have
abolished
this.
every
state
which
is
further
away
from
the
mainland
than
the
virgin
islands
have
done
away
with
similar
restrictions,
as
have
every
territory
which
are
subject
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
including
guam
and
the
northern
mariana
islands,
which
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
international
date
line.
they
are
both
subject
to
the
same
kind
of...
they
both
have
the
same
kind
of
court
system,
a
territorial
court,
a
district
court,
and
an
appeal
to
a
circuit
court
on
the
mainland.
they
are
all
subject--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--the
superior
court
of
guam
abolished
its
rule
after
piper.
the...
i
believe
that
the...
the
superior
court
of
guam
is
the
territorial
court,
and
unlike
the
virgin
islands,
it
licenses
lawyers
separately.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
as
well
as
the
district
court
of
guam,
which
is
similar,
it's
an
article
i
court.
but
the
district
court
of
guam,
whose
rule
we
quote
in
our
brief,
does
not
have
this
restriction.
the
district
court
of
guam
simply
says
that
anyone
can
be
a
member
if
they're
a
member
of
the
guam
territorial
bar.
but
if
you
want
to
practice
there,
you
need
to
have
an
active
lawyer
on
the
island
who
will
be
available,
not
simply
as
a
mail
drop
but
to
handle
the
cases
in
a
full
manner.
and
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
points
to
one
of
the
things
that
i
want
to
emphasize
here.
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands
is
a
hybrid
court.
it
is
not
simply
a
federal
district
court,
and
these
rules
do
not
simply
affect
people
who
want
to
try
federal
cases.
because
it
acts
as
the
equivalent
of
a
state
supreme
court,
or
the
highest
territorial
court,
it
excludes
lawyers
from
doing
everything
else
that
lawyers
do
without
litigating.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
okay.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
the
superior
court
of
guam
did.
the
superior
court
of
guam
abolished
that...
restriction
after
piper,
because
the
superior
court
of
guam,
like
the
district
court
here,
is
subject
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
under
the
organic
act.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
it
believed
that
it
was
bound
by
the
decision
of
this
court,
as
did
every
other
state
court
which
had
such
a
restriction,
and
every
other
territorial
court
which
had
such
a
restriction,
even
those
that
are
considerably
further
away
from
the
mainland
than
are
the
virgin
islands.
the
virgin...
all
that
the
third
circuit
did
here
was
to
bring
the
virgin
islands
in
line
with
every
other
jurisdiction
that
is
subject
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
that
may
depend
on
one's
perspective.
i
mean,
it
might
be...
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
one
may
seek
membership
in
guam,
and
i
understand,
justice
scalia,
that
there
are
mainland
lawyers
who
have
been
licensed
in
the
guam
bar.
pacific
rim
is
a
fast-growing
territory.
there
may
be
a
number
of
practical
reasons
for
lawyers
to
be
licensed
there
to
handle
business.
they
may
have--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--guam
is
further
away,
but
again
neither
the
superior
court
nor
the
district
court
see
the
need
for
these
restrictions.
and
in
terms
of
language
difficulties--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i
would
clarify
the
statement,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--that
they
believe
themselves
bound.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
difficulties
that
they've
had,
which
would
suggest
that
reversion
to
the
appropriate...
the
former
system
would
be
appropriate.
but
in
response
to
the
questions
also
of
justice
marshall
and
justice
scalia,
english
is
spoken
in
the
virgin
islands.
it
is
the
language.
it
is
unlike
puerto
rico,
where
english
is
required
to
be
used
in
the
district
court
but
spanish
is
required
to
be
used
in
the
territorial
court,
the,
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico.
the
difference
is
here...
i
think
if
anything
the
difference
are
cutting
more
in
our
favor
here
than
in
pacific
territories.
but--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--in...
in
puerto
rico?
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
uh,
no...
i
know
that
english
is
the
only
language
which
is
used...
spanish
is
the
official
language
in
the
puerto
rico
court
system.
but
english
by
statute,
in
28
usc,
is
the
official
language
in
federal
court
in
puerto
rico.
i
am
aware
that
english
is
the
only
language
used
in
the
territorial
and
the
district
court
in
the
virgin
islands.
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
is
a
statutory
requirement.
i
mean,
the
simple
point
is
that
the
language...
the
english
language
is
in
use
there,
even
though
it
is
not...
you've
got
to
be
bilingual
in
puerto
rico.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
no.
one
must
be
bilingual
in
puerto
rico,
but
english
is
the
only
language
that...
i
mean,
there
may
be
translators
if
somebody
speaks
only
spanish,
but
english
is
the
language
of
record
in
the
territorial
and
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands.
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
piper
case,
which
i
believe
provides
the
framework
for
analyzing
it,
this
particular
case,
and
although
the
third
circuit
decided
this
case
in
an
exercise
of
its
supervisory
authority,
we
believe
that
the
case
can
properly
be
addressed
either
under
piper
or
under
the
supervisory
authority.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
we
are,
justice
white.
we
believe
that
the
third
circuit--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--it's
not
that
the
facts
are
irrelevant,
it's
that
the
facts
as
a
matter
of
law
have
been
addressed
by
those
two
decisions.
and
i
want
to
point
out--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i
don't
think
they
have
to
be
decided
because
i
think--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--as
a
matter
of
law
under
piper
they
were
addressed.
and
let
me
say
specifically
the
point
of
that
decision
that
i'm
relying
upon.
the
argument
was
made
in
piper
that
this
rule
will
allow
not
only
lawyers
from
vermont
or
maine
but
lawyers
from
across
the
country.
and
the
court,
this
court,
considered
that
point,
and
considered,
as
we
read
the
decision,
the
possibility
of
limiting
it
just
to
an
adjacent
jurisdiction
as
your
honors--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i
think
that
under
piper
that
question
is
foreclosed,
where
the
court
said--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--as
a
matter
of
law
after
piper
that
would
be
our
answer.
and,
and
i
would
follow
that
up,
if
the
trial--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--excuse
me?
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
think...
that
reading
of
piper
that
is
pertinent
is
where
the
court
said
that
if
a
lawyer
lives
at
a
great
distance
from
the
licensing
jurisdiction,
that
is
not
a
basis
for
excluding
the
lawyer
from
being
licensed.
it
may
be
a
basis
for
requiring
local
counsel.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
it
didn't
say
that
explicitly,
but
i
think
the
reasoning
here...
and,
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
record,
what
we
have
in
the
record
here
is
really
nothing
as
substantive
as,
or
solid
as,
ms.
hodge
suggested.
the
evidence
on--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--it's
a
two-part
answer.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
foreclosed
under
the
analysis
about
distance
in
piper.
but
secondly,
even
if
it
is
relevant
in
this
instance,
the
respondent...
the
petitioners
have
not
provided
enough
evidence
to
sustain
their
burden
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i,
i
don't
think
that's
really
an
accurate
characterization.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
considered
the
arguments,
and
they
didn't
find
that
they
were
sufficient
in
this
particular
case,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
as
your
earlier
question
to
ms.
hodge
indicated,
travels
to
the
virgin
islands
twice
a
year.
the
judges
sit
down
there
every
december
and
april,
they're
familiar--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i
would
answer
the
question
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
were
no
findings
here.
this
case
was
submitted
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
the,
the
affidavits
which
the
petitioners--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--petitioner.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
correct.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
they
have
to
considered
as
true--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--but
in
terms--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--that's
correct.
but
let's
look
at
the
facts
that
were
put
forward,
because
they
really
were
not
facts,
as
such.
they
were
really
impressions.
in
the
affidavit
filed
by
mr.
barnard,
there
are
two
sentences,
two
sentences
in
the
entire
affidavit
about
air
service.
and
what
they
said
was
the
air
service
has
improved
over
the
last
several
years...
i'm
sorry
that
was
the
phone
service.
but
that
reservations
may
be
unavailable
for
commercial
flights
for
protracted
periods
of
time.
there
were
several
sentences
on
phone
service
where
they
say
substantially
improved,
but
it's
significantly
less
reliable
than
that
normally
expected
in
continental
united
states.
the
bar
association
president's
affidavit
said
not
one
word
about
airline
service,
and
simply
described
the
telecommunications
systems
as
erratic,
impaired
by
static,
echoes,
transmission
gaps.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
that
was
not--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--that
was
not
specifically
addressed.
but
i
would
point
in
response
to,
i
guess,
initially
justice
white's
question
and
the
chief
justice's
question,
the
affidavits...
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
could
find
that
the
affidavits
here
are
not
enough
to
justify
an
award
of
summary
judgment
much
less
to
deny
the
summary
judgment
motion
that
the
respondents
filed
and
forced
the
issue
to
trial.
and
while
we're
on
the--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--correct,
but
while
we're
on
the
area
of
the
adequacy
of
service,
i
think
it's
important
here
not
simply
to
focus
on
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case,
but
to
go
back
a
few
years
to
the
case
we
cited,
tradewinds
v.
citibank,
where
the
same
exact
issue
was
at
issue,
was
involved.
the
issue...
the
legal
issue
there
was
whether
a
national
bank
could
be
sued
only
in
jurisdiction
where
it
was
chartered,
or
whether
it
could
be
sued
anywhere
where
it
had
a
branch
office.
and
the
district
court,
the
same
district
judge
who
presided
over
this
case,
decided
that
it
was
perfectly
permissible
to
let
the
company
be
sued
in
the
virgin
islands,
and
it
cited
tremendous
advances
in
terms
of
airline
service,
in
terms
of
telecommunications,
and
in
terms
of
data
processing.
it
simply
cannot
be
said
on
this
record,
and
if
one
looks
at
the
judicial
pronouncements
previously,
that
the
service
is
good
enough
to
permit
mainland
clients
to
come
down
to
the
virgin
islands
and
be
sued,
that
the
phone
service
is
good
enough
to
let
them
come
down,
but
there
is
simply
not
enough
room
on
the
plane
for
mainland
lawyers
to
come
down,
or
the
phones
don't
work
it
it's
a
mainland
lawyer
who
wants
to
call
down
to
the
islands.
and
i'd
put
something
else
in
terms
of
the
adequacy
of
service.
this
rule
does
not
prohibit
virgin
islands
lawyers
from
engaging
in
practice
on
the
mainland.
they
can
litigate
cases
of
represent
clients
in
new
york
or
virginia
or
louisiana
or
new
hampshire,
and
the
rule
would
seem
to
assume
that
objective
criteria,
such
as
the
availability
of
airline
seats,
the
adequacy
of
telecommunications,
work
sufficiently
well
that
they
will
get
back
and
they
can
communicate
if
they
need
to.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
it
works
both
says,
justice
scalia,
for
this
reason.
i
mean,
to
the
extent
that
the
justification
is
based
on
the
idea
that
you
need
to
be
able
to
handle
cases
directly
in
the
virgin
islands,
and
you
need
to
communicate
directly,
the
rule
assumes
that
anyone
who
is
practicing
in
maine
will
be
able
to
satisfy
his
or
her
professional
obligations
in
the
virgin
islands
as
well,
that
one
can
travel
to
the
mainland
and
still
come
back
if
one
needs
to.
and
our
point
is
that
there's
simply
no
reason
for
assuming
that
only
virgin
islands
lawyers
will
be
conscientious
and
come
back
to
do
their
duties,
but
not
mainland
lawyers
who
want
to
divide
their
practice...
well,
it
is
a
concern
not
simply
of
maine
but
also
of
the
virgin
islands
as
well,
again
to
the
extent
that
it's
premised
on
the
idea
about
adequacy
of,
of
seats
and
the
like.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
there
was,
justice
white.
mr.
de
vos,
who
is
one
of
the
respondents
here,
submitted
a
rather
detailed
affidavit
based
upon
his
travel
to
the
virgin
islands
on
a
regular
basis
for
20
months.
he
put
in
objective
evidence
showing
that
there
are
four
airlines
providing
jet
service
to
the
virgin
islands
from
the
mainland.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
think
the
district
court
was
not
allowed
to
make
these
findings...
they're
not
findings...
these
observations
when
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
evidence--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i
think
under
this
court's
decisions
in
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby
and
celotex
that...
v.
catrett...
that
it's
not
enough
simply
for
an
opposing
party
to
put
in
an
affidavit
saying,
service
is
erratic,
or
airline
service
is
booked
during
some
time
of
the
year,
when
there
is--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--there
was
a
counter-affidavit
that
is
much
more
detailed,
that
spells
out
how
many
flights
there
are,
that
spells
out
there
were
nine
flights
a
day
during
the
high
season,
five
or
six--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i
think
the
third
circuit
was
faithfully
applying
this
court's
decisions
in
piper
and
frazier
that
a
lawyer's
great
distance
from
the
jurisdiction
is
not
an
adequate
basis
for
saying
that
the
lawyer
is
not
fit
to
practice
law,
is
not
fit
to
be
licensed
there.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
petitioners
tried
to
say,
things
are
different
here,
things
are
so
bad
down
here
that
we
can't
be
held
to
the
same
standard,
the
court
of
appeals
was
justified
is
saying,
they
haven't
raised
a
triable
issue,
they
haven't
put
forward
anything
to
suggest
why
they
are
different
or
why
they
should
be
unique.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
think
they
don't
matter
under
piper,
and
i
think
in
the
ultimate,
if
things
were
really
as
bad
as
the
petitioners
are
saying,
i
think
the
place
to
be
making
that
argument
is
not
before
this
court
but
across
the
street
in
congress
in
terms
of
determining
the
extent
to
which
the
virgin
islands
should
be
held
to
the
same
standards
as
the
mainland.
and
that's
important
for
this
reason.
the
inclusion
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
in
the
organic
act
was
a
deliberate
step
that
congress
took
in
1968.
up
to
that
point,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
didn't
apply.
there
would
be
no
question
that
this
sort
of
restriction
would
be
valid,
but
after
1968,
congress
extended
this
provision,
and
we
think
it's
significant
for
this
reason.
several
cases
from
this
court,
mullaney
v.
anderson
in
1952,
and
other
cases
involving
the
alaska
territory,
regarded
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
as
important,
because
it
indicates
congress'
judgment
about
how
isolated
a
territory
is,
how
much
discretion
and
latitude
a
territorial
judgment
should
have
in
being
able
to
decide
whether
to
favor
its
own
residents.
there
may
be
good
reasons
for
a
territory
to
decide,
we
want
to
favor
our
local
residents,
or
give
preferences
to
people
who
move
here,
because
it's
kind
of
rugged,
because
we
want
to
give
people
a
chance
to
move
in
or
an
incentive
to
move
in,
to
stay,
to
populate
the
territory,
and
to
develop
the
territory
if
one
day
it
might
come
forward
and
be
ready
for
state...
for
statehood.
but
the
court
fund
in
mullaney
that
it
was
significant
that
congress
had
enacted
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
with
respect
to
alaska,
and
it
brought
alaska
into
line
with
the
practice
in
other
states.
that
was,
as
i
recall,
fisherman's
case,
such
as
toomer
against
witsell.
and
i
think
that
that
fact
helps
to
put
this
case
into
the
proper
perspective.
congress,
which
has
plenary
authority
in
this
area
under
article
iv,
section
3,
looked
at
this
issue
about
to
what
extent
the
virgin
islands
ought
to
be
similar
to
the
other
territories
in
the
mainland,
and
it
decided
in
1968
in
the
amendments
to
the
fact
that
the
virgin
islands
are
ready.
the
1968
is
a
home
rule
statute.
it
gives
the
virgin
islands
the
right
to
elect
a
territorial
governor
and
lieutenant
governor,
as
they
had
previously
been
able
to
elect
a
territorial
legislature,
and
it
extended
constitutional
provisions
to
the
virgin
islands
consistent
with
their
status
as
a
territory,
and
by
that
i
mean
consistent
with
the
fact
that
citizens
of
territories
don't
vote
in
national
elections.
in
our
view,
it
reflects
congress'
judgment
that
with
political
rights
come
political
responsibilities,
including
the
responsibility
of
treating
citizens
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis,
citizens
of
other
states.
i
think
it's
useful
to
point
out
as
well
that
this
type
of
residency
restriction
is
not
simply
limited
to
the
legal
profession
or
to
lawyers.
as
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
mr.
hoffman
and
ms.
weatherly
indicate,
there
are
a
number
of
other
similar
rules
on
the
books
affecting
a
number
of
other
professions.
podiatrists,
electricians,
plumbers,
architects,
engineers,
land
surveyors,
and
taxicab
drivers,
all
are
subject
to
residency
requirements
if
they
seek
to
practice
their
profession
in
the
virgin
islands.
and
we
submit
that
that
also
casts
doubt
on
the,
the
argument
that
this
rule
is
specifically
and
narrowly
tailored
to
deal
with
a
specific
concern.
i
wanted
to
respond
also
to
one
point
that
justice
stephens
made
earlier
on
in
terms
of
the
question
to
ms.
hodge
about
are
lawyers
disbarred.
the
opinion
issued
in
the
district
court
indicates,
suggests
perhaps
more
accurately,
that
lawyers
who
refuse
to
take
their
share
of
cases
may
be
excluded
from
practicing
in
district
court,
but
it
does
not
suggest
they
may
be
totally
disbarred
and
forbidden
from
engaging
in
any
kind
of
office
practice
or
practice
that
does
not
involve
litigation.
in
this
case,
the
petition...
the
respondents
are
willing
to
do
whatever
is
obliged
of
any
other
resident
requirement...
of
any
other
residents
of
the
virgin
islands,
and
we
submit
that
the
case--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--i'm
not
sure
what
she
meant
by
this...
the
first
thing
she
said
was
they
were
excluded
from
practice.
i
don't
know
whether
that--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--excluded
from
district
court
practice
as
opposed
to
practicing
in
the
territorial
court
where
there's
not
the--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--that
is
correct.
the
residence
requirement
applies
to
anybody
who
wants
to
write
wills,
draft
contracts,
offer
opinion
letters--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--anyway,
yes.
and
that,
i
think,
is
another
reasons...
most
of
the...
most
of
the
focus
here
is
on
litigation
concerns,
but
the
rule
is
much
more
exclusionary.
in
fact,
it's
more
exclusionary
than
the
rule
in
piper
which
said
simply
that
you
have
to
live
in
the
state
on
the
day
you're
admitted.
and
it's
also
more
restrictive
than
the
rule
in
frazier
which
said
that
non-residents
can
open
an
in-state
office.
and
that's
all
they
need.
the
respondents
here
have
done
those
sorts
of
things,
but
they
are
still
being
denied
a
license.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment,
of
the
third
circuit
be
affirmed.
