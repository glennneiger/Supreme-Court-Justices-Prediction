justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
treat
it
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
virgin
islands?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
by
the
same
token,
i
take
it
if
it's
an
instrumentality
of
the
virgin
islands,
then
the
federal
statute
making
the...
privileges
immunities
clause
applicable
to
the
virgin
islands
does
apply
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there's,
there's
nothing
in
the
rule
that
says
appointed
counsel
can't
send
a
colleague
to
any
hearing
on
any
matter
in
an
indigent
case,
is
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can't
appoint
an
associate
counsel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
suppose
you
don't
think
that
you're
qualified
to
hear
a
homicide
case,
you've
got
to
try
it
all
by
yourself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
justified
as
being
necessary
for
the
smooth
functioning
of
the
public
defender
system?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
a
tax
attorney
and
you
have
to
try
the
homicide
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
just
give
him
a
robbery
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
a
requirement
of,
of
accepting
four
appointments
a
year
non-discriminatory?
