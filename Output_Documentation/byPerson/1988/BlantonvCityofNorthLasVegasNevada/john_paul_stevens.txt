justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
mr.
graves,
do
you...
do
you...
if
you
get
a
jail
sentence,
do
you
also
have
to
do
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
this...
but
your
position
is...
is
this
even
worse
than
six
months
in
jail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they'd
rather
go
to
jail
for
six
months
than
wear
this
for
48
hours?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
how
is
this
a
more
severe
penalty
than
six
months
in
jail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
got
six
months
in
jail,
that
would
be
the
maximum
under
the
statute,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why...
why
isn't
this
case
squarely
controlled
by
baldwin?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
the
statute
made
the
maximum
penalty
two
days
in
jail
or,
alternatively,
wearing
this
for
two
days,
would
that
violate...
would
you
then
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
you...
what,
what's
your
answer
to
my
question?
do
you
think
you
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial?
say
that
was
the
only
penalty.
you
have
to
wear
this
thing
for
two
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
that
what
the
only
penalty
is
for
most
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
there
was...
this...
wear
this
for
two
days
plus
a
$1,000
fine.
that's
the
maximum
penalty.
would
that
entitle
you
to
a
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
suspension?
if
you
go
to
jail
for
six
months,
can
you
have
the
90-day
suspension
concurrent
with
the
time
in
jail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but...
but
say
you're
convicted
on
january
1
and
the
judge
enters
an
order,
sends
you
to
jail
for
six
months.
when
will
your
license
be
suspended?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you...
the
suspension...
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out,
the
suspension
would
have
been
completed
before
you
finished
your
six
months
in
jail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
for
just
a
moment
because
is
the
quest...
the
constitutional
question
i
guess
is
whether
this
is
a
criminal
prosecution
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
where
the...
what,
what
we're
boiled
down
to.
the
six
months
was
the
decision
in
the
baldwin
case.
and
your
position
is
this
is
not
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
it
would
be
a
criminal
prosecution
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment
if
the
right
to
counsel
were
at
stake,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it's
a
criminal
prosecution--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
that's
exactly...
the
sixth
amendment
begins
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
these
different
rights
obtain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
there
are
some
criminal
prosecutions
that,
that...
some
prosecutions
are
criminal
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
another.
so,
the
same
words
have
different
meanings
depending
on
what
the
right
you're
asserting
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
not,
of
course,
what
the
text
of
the
sixth
amendment
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
along
justice
scalia's
lines?
supposing
the...
the
judge
had
the
authority
under
this
statute
to...
not
to
put
anybody
in
jail
for
six
months,
but
just,
say,
make
them
wear
this...
this
jacket
for
six
months,
do
you
think
they'd
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
asked
him
to
wear
it
for
seven
months?
justice
john
paul
stevens
six...
six
months
and
a
million
dollar
fine,
which
would
pretty
much
pauperize
whoever
is,
is
hit
with
that.
that
would
not
entitle
you
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
talking
about
the
particulars
of
nevada.
i'm
talking
about
the
principle
you're
asking
us
to
adopt.
i
mean,
we,
we...
we've
said
six,
six
months
as
a
general
matter,
but
you're
saying
that
six
months
in
prison
is
the
only
test.
no
matter
what
else
you
do
to
somebody,
a
fine
of
enormous
amounts,
making
them
wear
jackets
or
anything
else,
no...
nothing
counts
except
six
months
in
jail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
because
we've
said
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
way
the
statute
works?
the
statute
provides,
i
gather,
the
judge
can
sentence
him
to
two
days
in
jail,
no,
no...
not
less
than
two
or
more
or
to
perform
48
hours
of
work
for
the
community
while
dressed
in
distinctive
garb.
could,
could
the
judge
pick
the
distinctive
garb
that
the
judge
thought
appropriate,
or
is
there
a
statutory
description
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
if
the
judge
thought
that
this
wasn't
distinctive
enough,
the
judge
could
maybe
add
a
dunce
cap
and
a
few
other
foolish
looking
things
to
the
uniform?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
the
judge
really
took
something,
the
most
outrageous...
made
people
work
in
their
underwear
with
a
dunce
cap
or
something
crazy,
that
would
still
be...
that
wouldn't
trouble
you
either
i
suppose.
