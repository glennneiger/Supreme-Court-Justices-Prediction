justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
didn't
stand
that
strictly
on
it
because
wasn't
the
fine...
wasn't
the
possible
fine
here
more
than
$500?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
wasn't
really
all
that
wooden.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
all
that
wooden.
justice
antonin
scalia
selectively
wooden.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
sympathize
with
that,
but
i...
you're
telling
me
something
new
now.
i
thought
that
under
these
statutes
you
couldn't
force
anybody...
a
judge
could
not
force
anybody
to
wear
that,
that
it's...
it,
it
has
to
be
at
the
defendant's
option.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
does
the
statute
say?
doesn't
it...
i
thought
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
just
says
it's
an
option.
it
doesn't
say
who
has
the
option?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
the
statute?
how
does
it
read?
i'm
sorry...
this
point
is
important
to
me.
i'm...
where--
i
think
we
have
a
different
case
if,
if
somebody
can
be
forced
to
wear
this
thing
for
however
long.
at
least
i
think
it's
different.
0....
well,
if
it's
going
to
take
a
lot
of
time,
you,
you
can
do
it
on
rebuttal
if
you
like.
i,
i
didn't
mean
to...
i
thought
you'd
have
it
right
at
hard.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't
you
think
we
have
to
adjust
the
$500
for
inflation?
when
did...
when
did
we...
what's
the
inflation
rate
since
we
picked
$500?
i
mean,
i
know
the
constitution
says
how
many
dollars
for
a...
for
a
civil...
civil
jury,
but
i
really
don't
think
our
court
opinions
are
as
written
in
stone
as
the
constitution
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
$500...
maybe
$1,000
is
the
equivalent
nowadays
of
$500
before
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact,
this
is
a
malum
prohibitum,
isn't
it?
what's
the
alcohol
level
here?
is
it
the
case
that
everyone
who
has
this...
this
amount
of
alcohol
in
his
blood
is
necessarily
impaired?
i
thought
the
level
was
set
at
such
a
point
where
someone
could
be,
and
so
even
if
you
have
a
greater
immunity,
the
effect
of
alcohol
on
some
other
people,
if
you
get
picked
up,
it's
your
tough
luck.
and
i
would
consider
that
a
malum
prohibitum.
i
mean,
to
be
fall...
falling
down
drunk
when
you're
driving
is
malum
in
se,
but
to
have
your
alcohol
level
above
a
certain
point
where
someone
else
might
be
affected
but
you
aren't,
do
you
consider
that
malum
in
se?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
saying
it's
malum
in
se
to
have
point
whatever
the...
the
thing
in
your
blood
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
saying
if
the
legislature
makes
it
unlawful,
it's
malum
in
se.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
then,
then
you
have
to
convince
me
that
having.10
in
your
blood
necessarily...
that,
that
no
reasonable
person,
no...
no
honorable
person
would
consider
driving
with.10.
i
don't
know
that
that's
true.
i
think
that's...
that's
a
number
picked
with
a
good
deal
of,
of,
of
safety
margin
to...
to
embrace
some
people
who
may,
indeed,
not
be
affected
at
that
level.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
i
guess
how
heinous
this,
this
crime
is
viewed
by,
by
the
citizenry
and
if
to
be
convicted
means
you
were
falling
down
drunk
when
you
were
driving,
yes,
i'd
say
that's
pretty...
a
pretty
heinous
thing.
but
suppose
the
state
passes
a
law
that
says
we
don't
want
people
on
the
roads
who
have
had
anything
to
drink
and
they
set
the
level,
you
know,
real
minimum.
you
shouldn't
drink
any
alcohol
within
three
hours
before
you
drive.
now,
would
you
consider
that
malum
in
se
to
violate
that
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
the
state
says
we're
taking
no
chances.
nobody
should
have
any
alcohol
in
the
blood.
no
drinks
within
three
hours
of
driving.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
would
that
be
malum
in
se?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you've
got
to
tell
me
why.10
is...
you,
you
have
to
convince
me
that.10
really
means
that,
that
the
average...
at
least
the
average
person
is,
is
seriously
impaired--
justice
antonin
scalia
--[inaudible]
call
it
driving
under
the
influence
would
be
any
alcohol
in
your
blood.
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
why,
why
do
you
think
they
have
that...
wear
that
distinctive
garb
with
that
thing
on
the
back
of
it?
i...
isn't
that
great
indication
that
this
is
a
shameful
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you...
it
wouldn't
mean
anything
to
have
somebody
wear
that
kind
of
a
thing
and
it
says
i
sold
the
unused
portion
of
a
railroad...
railway
ticket.
that
wouldn't--
[laughter]
that
wouldn't
get,
get
anybody
to
think
less
of
you
particularly,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
shameful,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
shameful.
now,
what
if
a
state
decides
we're
not
getting
enough
conviction...
convictions
in
child
molestation
cases
because
the,
the
young
witnesses
get
intimidated
by
the
courtroom
and
the
jury
and
all
of
that,
and
we
think
that
the
real
punishment
in
a
child
molestation
case
is
just
being
convicted
because
that
will
ruin
you.
so,
we're
going
to
reduce
the
sentence
from
five
years
to
six
months
and
we're
going
to
provide
for
trial
of
all
child
molestation
cases
without
a
jury.
we're
sure
we'll
get
a
lot
more
convictions,
and
that
will
be
worth
it.
what
do
you
think?
could
a
state
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think...
do
you
think
that's
what
we'd
hope...
we'd
hold?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
like
that
result
that,
that
people
could
be
convicted
of
child
molestation
without
a
jury
trial.
and
you
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
what
the
framers
really
thought
they
were
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
acknowledge
that
if
i
don't
think
that
i
would
hold
that
way
in
the
case
of
a
child
molestation
statute
that's
reduced
from
five
years
to
six
months,
then
my
concern
in
this
case
would
be
more
than
just
the
six
months.
it
would
also
be
whether
this
is
a
shameful
crime
or
not,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
arguing
about
how
shameful
it
is.
